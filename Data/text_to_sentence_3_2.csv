44046,The bottom is too small.,44046,3
44047,I ordered a Medium and it fit well.,44047,3
44047,"It was made kind of sloppy, though.",44047,3
44047,There is a zipper along the side that flared outwards near the armpit.,44047,3

44047,I had to sew that one closed.,44047,3

44047,Wearing a bra is difficult with this.,44047,3
44047,The back is open in a way that you can't wear a plain bra or one that has straps that cross in the back without the straps being seen either way.,44047,3

44048,"It definitely arrived quickly, that's true.",44048,3

44048,Sadly I judt wasted my money.,44048,3
44048,Fortunately It wasn't that much...,44048,3

44052,Quality is not very good.,44052,3

44053,Clothes I've ordered so far don't be the actual size.,44053,3
44054,"I thought the chain was going to be a little more delicate and it tangles very easily, but other than that i love it!",44054,3
44054,Also love the little infinity bracelet I received as well!,44054,3
44055,Definitely not made for anyone with breasts.,44055,3
44055,"The plaid pattern is hard to imagine under any dress like a slip, but the entire thing is sheer, so... Not really sure how it's meant to be worn.",44055,3
44055,"Too bad though,  it's very cute.",44055,3
44056,alot bigger than expexted,44056,3
44057,They appear much larger than in person.,44057,3
44058,"But the collar bone was on my chest, the knees were on my thighs, and the legs stopped on my calf.",44058,3
44058,It worked and it didn't cost much.,44058,3
44059,The pendant was fine but the chain is cheaply made and broke a few days after my 9 year old wore it.,44059,3
44060,shoe is extremely wide.,44060,3
44061,Bigger in person than I imagined...not good earrings for talking on the phone,44061,3

44062,"Very pretty floral lace design lightweight, soft, and comfortable.",44062,3
44062,"It is gorgeous, but not for me.",44062,3
44062,The sleeves are about three-quarter length sleeves.,44062,3
44062,The material is made out of chiffon which is lightweight and breathable material works well as a beach cover up or as a regular cardigan to protect your skin from the sun.,44062,3
44062,It can be easily dressed up or down.,44062,3
44062,It looks like it is made of high-quality material and the lace detail is very pretty.,44062,3
44062,"The only complaint is it had a strong weird smell, like dirt or dust my allergies started acting up it caused me to sneeze a lot, but that is just me I have a very sensitive nose.",44062,3
44062,"I aired it out a bit it helped, but not much I guess you could also wash it.",44062,3
44062,According to wash and care instructions you can hand wash it.,44062,3
44063,"Nice bathing suit... top runs small, bottom runs big",44063,3
44064,fits well & looks good.,44064,3
44064,"However the first time I wore it I was at work when I discovered that on of the seams along the side in the hip area had not been properly sewn and there way about a 2"" hole there.",44064,3
44064,"It will be an easy fix, but it's not what you expect from something brand new.",44064,3
44064,And definitely not what you want to discover while at work.,44064,3
44065,Retired it because it was too large.,44065,3
44066,Omg It doesn't have a lot of Slots this wallet is Perfect on everything but so few slots for id and cards,44066,3
44067,The top of this dress does not match the bottom in terms of sizing.,44067,3
44067,I bought a medium dress and when I put it on the bust area was more of an extra large and the bottom area near a small.,44067,3
44067,Good quality material though.,44067,3
44067,I'll keep it and just have the top altered.,44067,3
44068,The case is a bit too bulky but it is one of a few that can fit 100mm cigarettes.,44068,3
44068,It can also hold 2 lighters (one on each side).,44068,3
44068,"It is made in China and quality is not the best, but it is quite decent.",44068,3
44069,"I'm 5'9'', thin to average weight, depending on the brand I can buy jeans size 29 through 32, 31 being the size I get most often and that's the size I ordered for these jeans.",44069,3
44069,"They fit perfectly, but they are certainly not slim fit or even ""stylish"" (pictures attached).",44069,3
44069,"The cut is rather straight, I'd say, especially when compared to other slim fit jeans made in Asia that I've gotten through Amazon.",44069,3
44069,"They seem to be quite durable, so $20 is a good price for a pair of jeans, it's just not really what I expected regarding how they look.",44069,3
44070,Stones too large and ring spins so the back side of the ring is always in front.,44070,3
44070,Decided what I was looking for was a full eternity band to eliminate this problem.,44070,3
44071,"Half of the socks fit great, but the other half were way too big.",44071,3
44071,"It was a set of eight, and I can only wear four of them comfortably.",44071,3
44071,If they were all the correct size I would have rated higher.,44071,3
44072,not as attractive on as appears in picture,44072,3
44073,Be prepared for shreds of material to come out of robe.,44073,3
44073,"Of course, I washed it before giving it to my grandson but not before shreds of the robe were all over the bedspread where I opened the package.",44073,3
44074,Very cute top but very very small.,44074,3
44074,I ordered a large & it fits like a small.,44074,3
44074,Good price so I will give it to a friend rather than return it.,44074,3
44075,"Good design

I prefer the boxer brief style

14% spandex turns out to be more form fitting than I like in a pair of underwear",44075,3
44076,The fabric is a little thin for my taste but I would expect it to be cool to wear in warmer weather.,44076,3
44076,This style is definitely for taller silhouettes.,44076,3
44076,"I'm 4'10"" and it didn't look great on me, almost clownish, so I returned it and received a full refund.",44076,3
44076,I'm sure others may find the style flattering and very comfortable.,44076,3
44076,Seller is very good and responsive.,44076,3
44077,"Very soft, durable and has a laptop sleeve BUT unlike my other backpack with a laptop sleeve, this one is not protected at all.",44077,3
44077,There's no hardboard backing to the back of this bag so be very careful when you put your laptop in.,44077,3
44077,I had to put a legal notepad in the laptop sleeve JUST to give it structure.,44077,3
44077,Just be careful of that if you do intend to use this mostly for laptop carrying.,44077,3
44077,I use this for grocery-shopping when I need to be on a bike.,44077,3
44077,Oh and the strap - at least my left one: CONTINUOUSLY loosens on its own.,44077,3
44077,The metal rectangle that holds it in place (where you tighten) keeps turning/rotating 90% so it loosens the entire strap and will NOT tighten.,44077,3
44077,I have to fix it almost 2 out of 3 times I use this bag (even briefly for 1-2 hours each time).,44077,3
44077,It's kind of annoying especially when you're on your bike weaving in and out of traffic.,44077,3
44078,Very cute and still fits but very hard to get in and out of.,44078,3
44079,need to adjust all the time,44079,3
44080,The swimsuit looks great.,44080,3
44080,"Good color and fit (I'm a size 8, so I ordered up and got an XL.",44080,3
44080,"They shipped a Large, but it fits fine) the only problem I have is the material.",44080,3
44080,There is NO WAY this suit is any more than 5% polyester or spandex.,44080,3
44080,"The material is cheap, cheap, cheap.",44080,3
44080,It doesn't even feel like it would dry if wet.,44080,3
44080,"It is made of the same material as the little princess dresses that are ""silk"" that you would buy your 4 year old daughter to play dress up in.",44080,3
44080,"So, all in all, if you're only interested in buying this swimsuit for the looks, go for it.",44080,3
44080,"But if you actually want to swim or get it wet, this is not the suit for you.",44080,3
44081,it was flimsy and not as pretty,44081,3
44082,Nice leather but if you expect to fit your cards in there and be able to get them back out forget it.,44082,3
44082,The slots are very tight and after struggling to get my cards in it was impossible to get them out.,44082,3
44082,"When you do get them in, the center part that should have been for cash (bills) can't be used because you can no longer push on the sides to open it up.",44082,3
44083,Runs big should have got a smaller size.,44083,3
44083,Asides from that it was beautiful,44083,3
44084,It was not what I expected.,44084,3
44084,It photographs great but when I received it I found the material to be cheap.,44084,3
44084,I wasn't pleased and didn't wear it.,44084,3
44084,I probably will but I wasn't impressed.,44084,3
44085,But still a little tight in the top and bottom areas.,44085,3
44085,"Wish all over seas company's would understand that American women, most of them, come in large sizes.",44085,3
44085,Meaning a size 16 here is the same as their XXXLarge.in most cases.,44085,3
44085,"With all of the over seas Companies making each size different, its hard to figure out what size to order from them  In the USA,  a size 16 is what it says.",44085,3
44086,Not impressed w the fabric.,44086,3
44086,Too warm for the summer on a hot day.probably would look best on a very thin body as the dress is smaller than expected........,44086,3
44087,"This is differently something that people with bigger boobs don't need, they don't fit as well.",44087,3
44087,I got two of mine in but it was nice to have a spot for underware,44087,3
44088,Looks like a nice enough shirt.,44088,3
44088,Material is on the thin side.,44088,3
44088,But BEWARE: you may not get the style you ordered.,44088,3
44088,"I selected the navy blue shirt and received a navy blue and white striped shirt with a collar and a bear on the breast with the words ""little brother"".",44088,3
44088,It'll do but I'd really rather have just received the plain shirt I selected.,44088,3
44089,Very wrinkled and hand washing makes it even worse.,44089,3
44090,This dress fits great and easy to wear.,44090,3
44090,I'm a XL or a 12 and I purchased a xxl.,44090,3
44091,Nice piece of jewelry.,44091,3
44091,"Hook gave trouble and had to be replaced but other than that, it's not bad",44091,3
44092,Ok gloves made by a small child... probably.,44092,3
44093,Just ok. Design true to picture.,44093,3
44093,But much bulkier than I thought.,44093,3
44094,"Well I knew I was pushing it with the sizing when I bought it, but my main issue was that it is neon, not emerald, and I was hoping for a deep Slytherin green.",44094,3
44094,"Its a pretty enough bright green, but it also swishes when you move.",44094,3
44094,"And I cannot recommend this to a lady my size, I'm a size12-14, it fits but manages to flatten my butt, and does no similar feat for my stomach.",44094,3
44094,"The size range they list are absolute Maximums, any larger and it will compress you to that size, which looks pretty bad on me.",44094,3
44095,I purchased this shirt with high hopes because I have the perfect pair of shoes to coordinate.,44095,3
44095,I was disappointed once I tried it on and it was wayyyyyyyyyy to tight.,44095,3
44095,"I used the sizing chart provided and even ordered a size up, no dice!",44095,3
44095,It was way to tight over the bust area and the arms seemed to be cut really small.,44095,3
44095,I would say if you are going to order this shirt order it 2 - 3 sizes bigger.,44095,3
44095,"I gave it three stars because other than the sizing issues the shirt was a beautiful color, the fabric was very lux, and the overall quality was good.",44095,3
44095,I am kind of bummed that it didn't fit.,44095,3
44096,It was very pretty when I got it.,44096,3
44096,I liked it because it had the adjustable chain on it.,44096,3
44096,I bought it for my mother and she loved it too.,44096,3
44096,It wound up breaking 4 days later.,44096,3
44097,It's beautiful but way too big !,44097,3
44097,Got a XL should of got m or L,44097,3
44099,"The style is cute  but it fits too small the size cut small  I  order the a extra large size I was Suprise  that it didn't  fit,the material  could be a  better quality,  I have returned  the dress back still waiting  for my refund",44099,3
44100,Over the shirt looks exactly as advertised.,44100,3
44100,"However, the material of the shirt feels like a raincoat.",44100,3
44101,This skirt is very pretty.,44101,3
44101,The color is true to the image (I got the light pink).,44101,3
44101,But the waistline is a mess.,44101,3
44101,I mean it's so bad you need to find a way to cover it.,44101,3
44101,The elastic is all janky and lopsided.,44101,3
44101,It looks like a home-ec project done by a 12 year old.,44101,3
44101,Get a belt or something else that can cover it up.,44101,3
44101,No self respecting adult would wear that waist band.,44101,3
44101,"I would give it 1 star, but it's so cheap I feel like this is a ""get what you pay for"" situation.",44101,3
44102,Not what the pic looks like,44102,3
44104,Items is great however it runs a lot larger than expected.,44104,3
44104,I reviewed numerous over reviews so I ordered a size down than what I typically would and it is still a bit big.,44104,3
44104,"However,  other than being a bit larger it looks good.",44104,3
44105,It's cute however the sides are high at the bottom of the shirt which means unless you want people to see your skin or tummy you have to wear some sort of tank under it.,44105,3
44105,Not sure how that will be possible since its strapless.,44105,3
44106,Its ok but because it's small I haveto keep pulling it down or it falls off my head.,44106,3
44106,It fits my teen daughter just fine tho.,44106,3
44107,It's just for give away.,44107,3
44108,"It fits and looks just like the images, but it had a weird odor.",44108,3
44108,Kinda Musty - I had to wash it and soak it in fabric softener to get rid of the smell.,44108,3
44109,"Very good material, but the dress old fashion style.",44109,3
44109,Not as sexy as it looks.,44109,3
44110,a bit smaller than expected,44110,3
44111,I had to get a smaller size for my 4 yr old granddaughter.,44111,3
44111,I size 4 was too big.,44111,3
44112,"This costume is cute, but the one I received was not only small, but it was also all stuck together in the package.",44112,3
44112,When I pulled it apart the color where the skirt had stuck together was damaged.,44112,3
44114,okay for the price.,44114,3
44115,About a cup size too small,44115,3
44116,This hat is cute but the measurements are off.,44116,3
44116,"The crown on the hat I received is 3"" deep - not 4.5"" as stated.",44116,3
44116,This makes a big difference in the look and fit of the hat.,44116,3
44116,Thankfully it has a wide brim so that kind of makes up for it.,44116,3
44116,"The brim is also much straighter than it looks in the photos, so it fits kind of like a cloche hat.",44116,3
44116,"I'm a woman so I'm okay with that, but I can't imagine a man wearing this.",44116,3
44116,I did receive this lightening fast and well packaged as always with e4hats!,44116,3
44117,A little too wide  but nice overall,44117,3
44118,I wasn't thrilled with this shirt.,44118,3
44118,"It didn't look like I thought it would, and the material was a bit cheap feeling.",44118,3
44118,"I thought it would have more of the ""cold shoulder"" look, but it doesn't.",44118,3
44118,You can barely see the detail of the straps.,44118,3
44119,"pockets are a bit large, but overall its an ok product.",44119,3
44120,Cheaper looking than expected.,44120,3
44120,Will work great after some fixing.,44120,3
44120,Definitely did not look like the picture.,44120,3
44121,The top portion is a bit see through.,44121,3
44121,"They placed those foamy pads where the breasts go and it just looks awful, need to remove or find a way to get a light fabric to cover it and make it not see through especially in that area.",44121,3
44121,It's beautiful but a bit cheaply made.,44121,3
44121,Not bad for the cost.,44121,3
44122,This was very cute...,44122,3
44122,But the bottom was smaller so if you have thick thighs it's a no...,44122,3
44122,I washed it once and it fell apart... Do not buy unless you only want it to wear once...,44122,3
44123,This is a super cute top but it is so small!,44123,3
44123,I ordered a size up and it is too tight across my bust.,44123,3
44124,These are mostly what I expected for the price.,44124,3
44124,"They are slightly bigger than expected, and seem cheaply made, but have been durable so far.",44124,3
44124,Am looking for magnetic clasps to replace what is on them as the current ones make them hard to put on snugly.,44124,3
44125,"A little more sheer than expected, but I always wear long tops with leggings, so not a very big deal.",44125,3
44126,It was the length of a shirt.....,44126,3
44127,Image and text are pretty pixilated...I have seen the image before it looks like a low res copy.,44127,3
44127,Not worth the price.,44127,3
44128,This wasn't the worse dress but I agree it looks like someone drapes!!,44128,3
44128,Not wasn't what I expected,44128,3
44129,"My daughter absolutely Loved the shoes, however, the plastic pulled from the toe and I had to send them back.",44129,3
44130,Fits okay..size chart a little off...,44130,3
44131,little bit more vibrant then I thought,44131,3
44132,"Cute when brand new, but not so after the laundry cycle.",44132,3
44132,"The rouching got more out of shape with every trip through the washer and dryer: tight in some spots, baggy in others.",44132,3
44132,OK for a single occasion where you want baby to have cute little Mary Jane feet.,44132,3
44133,Size runs a little small.,44133,3
44133,"Sleeves are a little  long, go figure.",44133,3
44134,"Smaller then expected , and color is not that noticeable !",44134,3
44135,Very Cute but runs SMALL,44135,3
44136,The swim suit is cute but it runs short.,44136,3
44136,U have to have a very short torso,44136,3
44137,I wish there was a size X small.,44137,3
44137,The small/medium was perfect right after my section but once the fluid was off my belly the small medium doesn't give the compression to my scar that I would like.,44137,3
44138,I like it but it was more of a long sweater than a dress.,44138,3
44139,"Really cute bathing suit, although it runs a little small and I wish the tassels were longer.",44139,3
44139,It will do nicely as a back up suit :),44139,3
44140,"I read some reviews advancing to size up because it was small, so I did, and I ended up with a s*** two sizes bigger than I needed.",44140,3
44140,I guess it depends on your body proportions.,44140,3
44140,Also this blouse is not all that pretty in person but I will definitely wear it sometime,44140,3
44141,Just received it and tried it on.,44141,3
44141,I have a 29in waist and ordered the medium.,44141,3
44141,"I'm starting off on the second row of hooks already, as the first row is too big.",44141,3
44141,"Not sure that if I'd ordered the Small, it would have fit at all.",44141,3
44141,I have a size Med Squeem that is now too big but the size Small is too small so I opted for this one because it has 3 rows of hooks.,44141,3
44141,Squeem should make theirs with 3 rows as well.,44141,3
44141,It's a lot softer on the inside than my Squeem.,44141,3
44141,I'll update my review to see if this one gets better.,44141,3
44141,UPDATE: I returned it.,44141,3
44141,"After putting it on, it bunched up in the back and the sides.",44141,3
44141,"Didn't have as much compression as I prefer, maybe because the material felt so lightweight?",44141,3
44142,"I love the shirt, but for some reason it took a REALLY REALLY long time to ship",44142,3
44143,All I have to say is I should have gotten an Extra Large.,44143,3
44143,Other than that the coat is actually very decent for the price.,44143,3
44144,"Thought it had pockets though
Disappointed there are none",44144,3
44145,It is tight fitting with long sleeves and the material is light and thin.,44145,3
44145,One issue is that the zipper gets stuck easily.,44145,3
44145,The colors online are very accurate to what you get.,44145,3
44145,The colors don't bleed or anything.,44145,3
44145,I returned mine because it wasn't the material I was looking for and the sleeves are too long.,44145,3
44146,The shirt is really pretty.,44146,3
44146,"All the reviews said to follow the size chart because it tends to run small, so I did and the shirt is way too large for me.",44146,3
44148,Extra Large fit as a normal large would have been.,44148,3
44148,Could have been just a tad bigger.,44148,3
44149,Fits okay but the fabric is too stiff,44149,3
44150,"Lava Beads and Glass Beads are really nice, but the Hamsa Hand is made of plastic not metal which means eventually the silver paint will come off.",44150,3
44150,The elastic strings that the beads are threaded on is starting to frey so I don't wear much.,44150,3
44150,I may cut them open and re thread on the clear plastic stretchy string and replace the plastic Hamsa Hands with metal ones.,44150,3
44150,I really like the jewelry and would like to wear almost every day but can't until I go to AC Moore to make changes.,44150,3
44151,"This ""sweater"" is not what I expected - it is comfortable but not something I'd usually buy.",44151,3
44151,"I really liked the print and have worn it a couple times but, I am really disappointed in the fabric.",44151,3
44151,"The fabric shown in the picture shows a light, cotton blend that you can slightly see through but, that is not close to what I received.",44151,3
44151,It seems to be a pretty hardy blend though.,44151,3
44151,Will update if it wears or washes out quickly.,44151,3
44151,** grey sweater with colorful sleeves **,44151,3
44152,Very hard to get my cards out once they are in this.,44152,3
44152,"I only carry 4, my cash is ok.",44152,3
44153,"Bottom hem not as shown in picture, so shirt not as flattering.",44153,3
44153,Fabric ok. Not at all as presented in picture.,44153,3
44154,"not too  bad nice and cool for the summer
look OK  i like it",44154,3
44155,Really not one size fits all.,44155,3
44156,You should show the label in order to recognize the correct size,44156,3
44157,Build quality seems fine to me.,44157,3
44157,I've worn these a few days.,44157,3
44157,"They are easy to adjust, and I usually forget I'm wearing them they're so comfortable.",44157,3
44157,"As others have said, the fasteners here will only work on verrrry thin socks, or, as long as the top 1"" of your socks are very thin.",44157,3
44157,"Like, on a scale of 1-10, 1 being women's panty hose and 10 being thick wool boot/winter socks, your socks couldn't be much thicker than a 2.",44157,3
44157,"I guess the designers opted for this fastener design so as to reduce risk of damage to the socks attached to them, whereas something simpler and stronger like alligator clips would eventually eat through a sock.",44157,3
44158,I am petite and this was to long for me.,44158,3
44158,I had to return it.,44158,3
44159,"Love the color of this dress, but wish there was less material at the waist.",44159,3
44159,"I have a slender build and small chest, and the dress seems to droop awkwardly in the front between the neckline and the waistline.",44159,3
44159,"I think it can be altered to fit better, but would recommend ordering smaller than you normally wear if you have a smaller build.",44159,3
44160,Good quality tights for the price.,44160,3
44160,Waist is small and does not stretch a lot.,44160,3
44160,it's a bit difficult getting past my upper thighs and butt.,44160,3
44160,So perhaps medium would've been better.,44160,3
44161,It was completely sheer and I am a c-cup and it was too tight even in an XL.,44161,3
44162,super SHORT... not a dress... decent fabric and workmanship...,44162,3
44163,But I ordered through Prime and didn't get them until 7 days later.,44163,3
44164,"Not the greatest quality, but you get what you pay for.",44164,3
44164,"I'm a curvy size four and the small was too tight, so I would recommend ordering up.",44164,3
44165,Cute suit ..but way toooooo small.,44165,3
44165,Be sure to order 2 sizes up to get close!,44165,3
44166,beautiful dress but way too long and would be impossible to shorten and save bottom.,44166,3
44166,slip shoes through dress.,44166,3
44167,These were to replace a pair of NB Walking Shoes of similar style.,44167,3
44167,I like them and they fit okay but are a bit tight.,44167,3
44167,The toe box is wide enough but not deep and the shoe is not quite as lengthy as the old shoe of the same size.,44167,3
44167,I'm keeping them because they are wearable and I think they will break in well enough.,44167,3
44168,"I was under the impression this was gonna be more of a sweatshirt, but it's pretty thin material.",44168,3
44169,This product ships from China and the sizing is for small busted women.,44169,3
44171,Bottoms fit but the top runs small,44171,3
44173,Took over a month to get here !,44173,3
44173,Looks exactly like the picture though.,44173,3
44173,"The material is pretty cheap too, as if the pattern part is gonna come off shortly.",44173,3
44174,I love this print and have it in a top.,44174,3
44174,"The ""leggings"" are thin, made of a similar material to the top.",44174,3
44174,But I still like them.,44174,3
44174,Just gotta remember matching undies.,44174,3
44175,These pants are similar to a pantyhose feel!,44175,3
44175,Very thin but not too see through.,44175,3
44175,Pretty snug for an XL.,44175,3
44175,It's what I would normally wear but felt more like a M/L size.,44175,3
44176,I thought this was really poor quality and super ugly when it first showed up on my door step.,44176,3
44176,"After washing it, it's actually not so bad.",44176,3
44176,Still not the highest quality but looks way better than it originally did.,44176,3
44176,"However, not as awesome as the picture for the product.",44176,3
44177,Needed  next size.,44177,3
44178,"too tight...i am 5'4, 120 lbs.",44178,3
44178,"zipper on the side, too tight for me.",44178,3
44178,i purchased a small size.,44178,3
44178,i aint crazy about the fabric.,44178,3
44178,But like price like fabric,44178,3
44179,alot shorter that it shows in the picture,44179,3
44180,My daughter loves it...,44180,3
44180,"Normally she is a size medium Juniors...5'3"" and 125 lbs.",44180,3
44180,I ordered a Large...,44180,3
44180,It just fits without being bagging...,44180,3
44180,The top portion come up to the nape of the neck and is intended for a taller person for that and armholes...,44180,3
44180,"If she was 5'5"" it would have got better for the top, but regardless she loves it and it's super cute!",44180,3
44181,I love this necklace.,44181,3
44181,"However, it arrived missing a skull almost dead center, hence only three stars instead of five.",44181,3
44181,"I simply removed a skull from each side, and used one to fill the empty spot.",44181,3
44182,little heavy for 5 y.o.,44182,3
44182,"girl, but nice and colorful.",44182,3
44183,"Very cute, just smaller than pictured and inscription is difficult to read.",44183,3
44184,"Not quite what I expected, but it works.",44184,3
44185,feels kinda flimsy in your hand but works great.,44185,3
44186,Cute but the color is a little dull compared to the picture,44186,3
44187,"it's ok, I should have ordered the medium.",44187,3
44187,"The top itself is pretty and the material is good, very flowy.",44187,3
44188,Just didn't fit well.,44188,3
44189,These shirts are definitely cheap.,44189,3
44189,Stitching is sloppy especially at the shoulders and the back panel overlaps to the front on the side of the shirt which looks just a bit awkward.,44189,3
44189,"I bought 2, one red and one white.",44189,3
44189,"The red is dark, not unlike blood, not too bright, very pretty.",44189,3
44189,The white is bright and cool.,44189,3
44189,"The fabric is smooth and flowy, very soft and comfortable.",44189,3
44189,"They hang nicely, the style is as advertised and just what I was looking for to pair with strappy bralettes.",44189,3
44189,I took the shirts to my mom to tidy up the stitching and switch the front and back panels to overlap front to back instead of back to front.,44189,3
44189,That detail is pretty minor.,44189,3
44189,"I would still wear the shirt even without this alteration, I am just quite picky and lucky my mom happens to be a seamstress.",44189,3
44189,"I ordered size M.  I am 5'2"", 125 lbs.",44189,3
44189,Measurements 34 26 35.,44189,3
44189,They fit me well.,44189,3
44190,"Looks like it was cut for a child, would have liked it if it fit the right way",44190,3
44191,"Looks too yellow, but very sturdy and well made",44191,3
44192,I am true size 6.,44192,3
44192,"They are quite short for me (5'9"") and the waist does not have much give (no elastic or buttons) but
I like the flow of it.",44192,3
44193,it runs a little small.,44193,3
44193,"if you're at all between sizes,go up",44193,3
44194,Cute but top of it kept falling off my shoulders,44194,3
44195,its great bet every time I look up it chocks me,44195,3
44196,"Do not recommend buying if you have a big butt, got a run in them almost immediately, they're fine if you wear longer shirts but not the best.",44196,3
44197,"After a few uses, some really thin rubber threads started poking out and then wadding up and are VERY obvious on the black tank.",44197,3
44198,Nothing against the shoe itself - the shoes are great - but they are NOT advertised correctly.,44198,3
44198,I purchased a 10 and got a 10/11.,44198,3
44198,I wish I had read the other reviews where this was mentioned.,44198,3
44198,"Clearly the seller is taking advantage of parents who will ""just keep them for when they can grow in to them.""",44198,3
44198,Well screw you seller - I need the correct size NOW - not a shoe for 1 year from now!,44198,3
44199,Looks a lot cuter in the model.,44199,3
44200,Definitely do not dry this tee.,44200,3
44200,"Its ok, a little tight around the arms for me.",44200,3
44200,But decent quality fabric.,44200,3
44200,I bought it in black and gray.,44200,3
44200,Wished I had just purchased one first.,44200,3
44202,The cigarette holder split when I placed a pretend cigarette on it.,44202,3
44202,"It served its purpose though, to be a prop for a 20s party.",44202,3
44203,Bought for my daughter for christmas.,44203,3
44203,She was very happy with it,44203,3
44204,Don't get the white.,44204,3
44204,Only get the black!,44204,3
44205,"It isn't as full as it looks and comes out looking much cheaper than expected, but I have seen worse",44205,3
44206,I expected to be more flexible because I was planning to use this for cardio kickboxing but it's a bit restricting.,44206,3
44206,It's a nice fit for me though..just not flexible enough.,44206,3
44208,Nice but buy one size up,44208,3
44209,I order a large and was a bit too loose on me Its a soft material.,44209,3
44209,It looked cute with a belt.,44209,3
44209,Should have ordered a small though,44209,3
44210,"Good quality, amazed at how quickly it shipped, but it is a little small.",44210,3
44210,Not much distance from the underwire to the top.,44210,3
44211,The saying goes you get what you pay for.,44211,3
44211,My daughter was disappointed when she tried it on because the skirt was on backwards & the bows were way off center.,44211,3
44211,Luckily she had a home ec teacher that was kind enough to fix it for her.,44211,3
44211,In the end she was happy & got to where it to Noka Kon.,44211,3
44212,"Despite following the size chart guidelines, this was too tight and it definitely does not fit as shown.",44212,3
44212,The saving grace is that my granddaughter loves it and it fits her fine (she's 13 years old!),44212,3
44212,"I think the size chart, regardless of the buyer being warned about the sizing, is based on a standard created by the fashion industry, not for an average female.",44212,3
44213,The applicator sponge became unattached to the handle on first usage; I didn't use the polish but did use the brush for polishing.,44213,3
44213,The brush was small but did a fine job polishing.,44213,3
44213,I liked that a clear leather cream was included for other colors besides black.,44213,3
44213,This would be a good kit for travel and touchups.,44213,3
44214,This was super uncomfortable.,44214,3
44214,I had to return.,44214,3
44215,I really like it when I first received it but the gold has been wearing off and the metal has become itchy.,44215,3
44215,I'm going to be trying to find another one since the gold has mostly wore off.,44215,3
44216,very thin silky nylon material.,44216,3
44216,"it would be very cute on someone with a tiny silhouette, not my 5'4"" 170lb  apple frame.",44216,3
44216,"if you have large thighs and a small waist and bust, this would be perfect for a spring party or wedding.",44216,3
44216,"unfortunately, I am giving to my sister who is much skinnier than i am.",44216,3
44217,Not the best made slippers and not sure how well they will wear.,44217,3
44217,only had them on once.,44217,3
44217,Probably wouldn't buy this style again.,44217,3
44218,I'm giving a 3 just because it shipped quickly and the shirt is not too too bad...but..,44218,3
44218,The material is not cotton and the stripes are more of a lavender it is very loose in the arms.,44218,3
44218,When ordering from China just keep in mind that the pictures are not accurate and it's pretty much a gamble.,44218,3
44218,It is very hit or miss.,44218,3
44219,I got the largest one i could and its doesn't fit well would say if your a larger or broader kinda guy you might just wanna look elsewhere.,44219,3
44220,"The fit is short rather than long as pictured, I am short so I expected the coat to fit around my thighs, rather it fits around my hips.",44220,3
44222,"Blouse is nice, but fits small",44222,3
44223,"Had to give to my 12 year old daughter, did not fit as shown",44223,3
44224,The top was cute but the cups do run very small to the point where it just looks like a lace bra  on me instead of a top (fyi I am a 32 C) but it really is very cute there is no pads so bra may be needed the lace is alright nothing high quality but nothing extremely cheap I will be putting this under button up shirts and use it as a bando kinda thing but again its cute this would probably work as a top for a lady who is a small to xsmall with a smaller chest,44224,3
44225,"They are thin material and they scuff pretty easily, but they are decent for the one show I need them for.",44225,3
44226,"Soft, comfortable, not as nice looking as I expected.",44226,3
44227,These shirts fit small but they are doing the job.,44227,3
44227,I bought them to wear under a safety vest at work.,44227,3
44227,They are light and airy...,44227,3
44227,"Overall, I like them.",44227,3
44228,cute purse.. the wallet already broke and they did not come with sunglasses like it was advertised,44228,3
44229,great for dress up,44229,3
44230,"Cute shirt, just a little small",44230,3
44231,"Its a really cute bikini, but you need a slim body .",44231,3
44231,I'm a xsmall size and i bought the small one and it was a litte bit small for me.,44231,3
44231,You cant see through but the material is what you paid for.,44231,3
44232,"I checked the sizes and ordered a 75/B34, as that is the size I wear in most brands of bras.",44232,3
44232,"The waistband sizing was accurate, it definitely fit there but the cups were heavily padded and small.",44232,3
44233,The watch is clean looking- also very comfortable to wear!,44233,3
44233,"Only dis- like is that it stops while wearing, even if you wear it all day, it stops while sleeping then have to reset all over again
hard to wind as the case is in the way,,, I bought 2 of them will try black face with white letters and see how it is",44233,3
44234,The size was too small even though we chose the correct size.,44234,3
44234,Might want to order bigger than desired,44234,3
44235,"product was ok and fit as expected, however, i received it damaged.",44235,3
44235,needs to be shipped in better packaging IMO.,44235,3
44236,the leather is cheap looking.,44236,3
44237,I purchased for my 9yr old daughter and she will not wear them as they are extremely uncomfortable.,44237,3
44237,I would only suggest them if they were for a speacial occaison as the design is beautful and the stones are perfect (non missing at all on arrival and have stayed on with multiple wear),44237,3
44238,Really really big they fit me not my toddler,44238,3
44240,This shirt was thin and tan on top like others have mentioned.,44240,3
44240,"That would've been fine with me, but it's so huge.",44240,3
44240,I don't know if I'll wear it or not.,44240,3
44241,Not the best made..but good for the money..an the son likes,44241,3
44242,THis shirt is cute but larger than expected and the neck is larger than normal,44242,3
44245,And kinda of cheap looking.,44245,3
44246,It is a very nice billfold if you don't carry very many cards.,44246,3
44247,Too small  but super nice,44247,3
44248,"Cute, but quality is less than average.",44248,3
44249,Returning for a refund,44249,3
44250,This shirt is ok.,44250,3
44250,It  does run small.. at least the one I got did.,44250,3
44251,Beautiful but way too small.,44251,3
44252,The sock top is so close to the heel that it slips off constantly.,44252,3
44252,I probably will not be able to wear these other than under very snug sneakers.,44252,3
44253,I guess I did not realize what sherpa is.,44253,3
44253,Looks and feels a bit like a sweatshirt.,44253,3
44253,It is more comfortable than dressy.,44253,3
44256,too long waisted and too long legged.,44256,3
44256,would be fine if i were 6 feet tall with a 36 inseam,44256,3
44257,0-6 months is such a vague size.,44257,3
44257,These are an infant size 3 (striderite size),44257,3
44258,Not my favorite Hipsy headband.,44258,3
44258,The graphic is cheap looking and the fit is loose even after adjusting.,44258,3
44259,"Not the light pink I ordered, it's more of a light salmon color.",44259,3
44259,"LOTS of material which I guess is to be expected and no problem for me, I'll just alter.",44259,3
44259,"But funny thing is, it didn't come with the color matched belt in the picture, it came with a black faux leather rope with a black faux leather flower on it, which is sorta cute but I would've preferred the same colored belt.",44259,3
44261,warm-thin but go a size up,44261,3
44262,"I am usually a small, but I ordered a medium.",44262,3
44262,It is still a bit tight up top.,44262,3
44262,The cut forces the armpit fat to bulge out a bit.,44262,3
44262,"Maybe that can be fixed when I lose some weight, not sure.",44262,3
44262,It comes with EXTRA breast pads.,44262,3
44262,I personally hate breast padding.,44262,3
44262,There are built-in breast pads that I can't remove.,44262,3
44262,"The placement is very narrow, made for someone much thinner than myself.",44262,3
44262,I'm going to request for an exchange for a larger size and see how it goes.,44262,3
44262,I feel it has potential to be more attractive on me with the right fit.,44262,3
44263,Good for the price!,44263,3
44263,I can't decide how I feel about the style of it overall - it certainly looks different on me then the model for whatever reason.,44263,3
44264,Great for a costume but quality ain't soo great,44264,3
44265,"Very soft and comfortable  Would've given it 4 stars but it has removable pad liners in it , which I'm not a fan of.",44265,3
44265,"It may have mention in the description but if it did, I passed that part.",44265,3
44266,It is beautiful but since it has stones on the sides of the ring that scratch rub against your other fingers and one of those little stones has already fallen out and I ve worn itmaybe ten times.,44266,3
44267,On first glance they are so cute!!,44267,3
44267,But the more I look at them the more I'm starting not to like them if that makes any sense.,44267,3
44267,"The flowers are adorable but the band doesn't look comfortable for babys head (I havnt tried it yet,  baby isn't born yet)  hey have a metal clasp under the flowers that looks even more uncomfortable,  I'm going to hotglue felt over it since its covered by the flower and see if it helps,I don't think I'll be able to use them long but time will tell.",44267,3
44267,But they are cute so that's a plus.,44267,3
44268,Gave it to my daughter,44268,3
44269,Cut into my knuckles quite a bit,44269,3
44270,UPDARE: Washed one time and it shrunk.,44270,3
44270,I pulled it back to a more normal size.,44270,3
44270,May be better if hand washed in cold water.,44270,3
44270,This cover is very cute.,44270,3
44270,I love the tassels which give it style.,44270,3
44270,It is no longer than a regular t-shirt would probably be.,44270,3
44270,I wear a large and the one size,44270,3
44271,It's ok for the price.,44271,3
44271,I'm 5'6 and 120 pounds.,44271,3
44271,Ordered a large and it's not as loose as I hoped it would be.,44271,3
44271,"If you are taller than me, it will be too short to wear as a dress.",44271,3
44271,"Material is somewhat weird, it's stretchy and not as flowy as a picture",44271,3
44272,Just a little snug!,44272,3
44273,Paintv was chipped upon arrival.,44273,3
44274,"I selected a size large, a size I often wear, or medium.",44274,3
44274,"This jacket, while I liked it, was way to small, even though labeled as large.",44274,3
44276,Not as warm as I thought they were going to be but warmer than cotton crew socks.,44276,3
44277,I wear a xl ordered a XXXL so that it can fit because I read earlier reviews saying it runs small.,44277,3
44277,This dress is short and rises up I will have to wear with leggings,44277,3
44278,it feels good but medium is too small as in too small :(,44278,3
44279,If you are size 10 then you should pick size 14 or may be 16.,44279,3
44280,Its beautiful however the left side is twisted and doesn't fit on the heel properly.,44280,3
44280,It is lower on the left heel and kept slipping off.,44280,3
44280,It is also very narrow and my child has narrow feet and these shoes were difficult to slip onto her feet.,44280,3
44281,I ordered a XL.,44281,3
44281,"I am about a size 14/16, carry all of my weight in my stomach and I do not like any tight fighting clothes.",44281,3
44281,This dress fits perfectly.,44281,3
44281,"Only disappointment was, the color in the picture is brighter than the actual dress, it's off white, not white like the picture.",44281,3
44282,I didn't get all of the colors shown.,44282,3
44282,"No light blue, no olive, mostly blacks and grays.",44282,3
44282,Other than that they are fine.,44282,3
44282,I really wanted all of the colors shown to match with flannel shirts though.,44282,3
44283,Too big on the arms like huge.,44283,3
44283,Too much material so aim for a smaller size for sure,44283,3
44284,The tunnels are plastic.,44284,3
44284,I had expected them to be either metal or a granite Of Some sort .,44284,3
44284,"However , I didn't expect to get the swirled stretchers , was very glad.",44284,3
44284,"However , the sizes went by 2's , so a lot of sizes were not included which can be painful.",44284,3
44286,love the print and color but was too small for me.,44286,3
44286,Even looked at the size chart.,44286,3
44287,I got these for my son and the first pair was TINY compared to all his other shoes in that same size.,44287,3
44287,I had to go up 1.5 sizes for it to actually fit him.,44287,3
44287,"Not the quality I am used to with VANS, they seem heavy and he complains that they aren't comfortable.",44287,3
44288,Not 5 stars due to rings on shoulder strap are not closed and the straps slip out constantly.,44288,3
44289,It ok for the price,44289,3
44290,The one I got I s a very blurry print.,44290,3
44290,It's almost like a Monet because it looks better from far away.,44290,3
44291,Not the size I thought it would be.,44291,3
44291,It is very small.,44291,3
44291,It doesn't match the rest of my collection.,44291,3
44291,I just assumed it would be the same size and quality of all of the other marvel tin signs I have found at my local swap meets.,44291,3
44291,But it's a small thin tin sign.,44291,3
44291,Still a really good product if that is what you wanted out of it.,44291,3
44291,And it was shipped really fast.,44291,3
44291,Not the seller's fault that I didn't pay more attention to the size of the product in the description.,44291,3
44291,But now I will probably re-gift it and continue looking for the correct size to finish my collection.,44291,3
44293,It fits nice but fabric is cheap.,44293,3
44294,The fabric of the Tee-Shirt is excellent.,44294,3
44294,The blue color is stunning.,44294,3
44294,We have been disappointed with the print of the Beatles walking across Abbey Road.,44294,3
44294,The print is out of print (fuzzy).,44294,3
44295,"Color was good, material was fine.",44295,3
44295,It was a little smaller then I thought it would be.,44295,3
44295,Overall it was good.,44295,3
44296,After washing lost a lot of the length.,44296,3
44296,If you buy this- line dry.,44296,3
44297,Flattering swimsuit for any body type.,44297,3
44298,We had ours for about a week before the little balls on the end started to gal apart and come off.,44298,3
44298,My wife had to sew them back together and then back on.,44298,3
44299,It's a beautiful ring but it is way to small.,44299,3
44299,I feel like I am going to break it when I take it off,44299,3
44300,I would not call these yoga pants.,44300,3
44300,They're much more like regular spandex leggings you get to wear under a dress or long shirt.,44300,3
44300,The picture makes it look like it has a fitted high waist and they aren't really like that.,44300,3
44300,The material is not super flexible/stretchy and is kind of scratchy.,44300,3
44300,"There is a band around the waist (sits comfortably just above your belly button) that is pretty snug, but because the rest of the pelvic region isn't very form fitting I had to adjust them a lot while wearing and I only took my dog for a walk.",44300,3
44300,They're somewhat small too so if I had got the fit a Medium normally is for me I would have to adjust them even more.,44300,3
44300,As it was they didn't fit well at the top of my thighs and had a hard time pulling them up enough to be comfy.,44300,3
44300,"I think ""yoga"" pants should have a little more stretch.. if you're going to be stretching.",44300,3
44300,Which is what yoga is.,44300,3
44300,I would definitely not recommend them for yoga.,44300,3
44300,The colors are great and true to picture (I got black on top that changes to purple/pink below the knee and that part looks great!),44300,3
44300,"However, for the money, I don't think I would order them again.",44300,3
44300,I would expect to pay around $15 for pants like this and $22.95 left a little to be desired.,44300,3
44302,Bought a 2T (my son is mainly wearing 2T and they are typically on the big side for him).,44302,3
44302,But this 2T fit like an 18mo shirt.,44302,3
44302,Hope to get a few wears out of it considering it was so expensive.,44302,3
44303,This dress looks just like it  does in the picture.,44303,3
44303,The tie is navy blue and so on.,44303,3
44303,It looks okay but I didn't like how unflattering the stripped top was.,44303,3
44303,It makes me look bigger.,44303,3
44303,I wear a thick light brown belt  and not the  thin navy belt to balance out the shaping.,44303,3
44303,Some of the reviewers say that this dress was baggy on them.,44303,3
44303,"If you order your exact size or order a size down, you shouldn't have this problem.",44303,3
44303,"Also, the material is quite cheap feeling.",44303,3
44303,It does look nice when adjusted and it feels comfortable.,44303,3
44303,I may order from this company again if something catches my eye.,44303,3
44303,"Btw, I'm 5'7, 250Ibs and I ordered an XL.",44303,3
44304,The TARDIS is a little bigger than I expected and the chain is cheap and turned my neck green.,44304,3
44304,"Still, the TARDIS is nicely made and it fits nicely on any other chains you have.",44304,3
44305,It fits like a small.,44305,3
44305,it is a good thing I did get medium.,44305,3
44305,"Sleeve area a little tight but all in all it is good material, comfortable feeling",44305,3
44306,It will serve the purpose of getting dance clothes too and from class.,44306,3
44306,Be careful if you are carrying anything other than slippers!,44306,3
44307,The middle part broke off after 2 weeks and the rose gold color starts to fade in a couple weeks too.,44307,3
44308,The description doesn't say anything about being a cropped cardigan.,44308,3
44308,It is adorable but I would have passed on it if I knew.,44308,3
44309,Thought it would be a little thicker it's just a thin light jacket kinda like a summer jacket not what I expected,44309,3
44310,Its cute and the shade of color is amazing!,44310,3
44310,However its like wearing a thong.,44310,3
44310,The bottoms are weird and waaay to small.,44310,3
44310,Will be wearing the top with a solid black bottom.,44310,3
44311,"It's cute the first time you wear it, but you HAVE to hand wash it or it'll shrink like mad.",44311,3
44311,"I put mine in the washer, but hung it to dry and it was still crazy small.",44311,3
44311,Not really what I want in a workout top.,44311,3
44312,Well for the cheap super cheap price I guess you get what you pay for but it's supposed to be 925 silver and I have other 925 silver rings that I wear non stop but this one actually makes my finger turn color.,44312,3
44312,So it's pretty to wear but I don't recommend wearing it all the time.,44312,3
44312,Also the sizing is smaller than normal.,44312,3
44312,"I ordered another ring from the same company same size and this one is way smaller, works but I am not real happy about the ring in general.",44312,3
44313,Only thing when I wash the shirt.,44313,3
44313,Everything sticks to it.,44313,3
44313,It is comfortable and really cute,44313,3
44314,The ONLY thing I find frustrating and a tad bit painful is removing the piece from my nose.,44314,3
44314,"How ever, I do believe this can depend on exactly where you have your piercing.",44314,3
44314,Mine is higher and more forward.,44314,3
44314,So I believe that's where I struggle.,44314,3
44314,NONETHELESS; it's absolutely gorgeous And removal is becoming easier.,44314,3
44315,"pretty good material, but somewhat too small in design for older kids like 15-18 years old.",44315,3
44315,The neck part is too short to cover well.,44315,3
44316,I had to custom made my costume.,44316,3
44316,I used this red gown as part of it.,44316,3
44316,It works but only as addition.,44316,3
44317,was smaller than I expected,44317,3
44318,"It's a nice thing to have for a Kylo Ren costume, but it's not a very good toy.",44318,3
44318,"Prop wise it looks fine, but the blade is made out of very flimsy plastic that was not meant to be banged against another plastic lightsaber toy.",44318,3
44319,"This is ok, I probably wouldn't buy it again.",44319,3
44319,The quality is iffy and the strap broke during the second use.,44319,3
44319,"It looks exactly as pictured though, I'm giving this to my toddler to use as a play purse.",44319,3
44320,"not ideal for chubby girls, or if you have larger cup e.g.",44320,3
44320,: D & above.,44320,3
44320,The cloth is not enough to cover and makes it look funny.,44320,3
44320,"Still, a very beautiful dress with comfortable material.",44320,3
44322,it broke the first time i wore it:(,44322,3
44323,These are not shoes,44323,3
44324,"Really cute, nice material and well made.",44324,3
44324,Runs large (does not match chart measurements).,44324,3
44324,"Too big for me, but may be a good fit for my mother.",44324,3
44325,They fill the reason I bought them.,44325,3
44325,Indoor slippers that I can get in and out of easily and go outside when necessary.,44325,3
44326,Too baggy & large...,44326,3
44327,Nice to wear around the house,44327,3
44328,these are cute and are a fair price.,44328,3
44328,but i found them to be a little heavy and clumsy for my daughter to be walking around in.,44328,3
44328,"she's 4, and it's not ideal to wear them for more than an hour or two because they are heavy.",44328,3
44328,also not recommended for running in.,44328,3
44329,Good design but not good material,44329,3
44330,It wasn't what i expected.,44330,3
44330,Thought it would be thicker.,44330,3
44331,"Shinny material, ok nicely cut!",44331,3
44332,The chain is not what I expected it to be and it's smaller than what I had expected,44332,3
44333,They could have used a better quality elastic.,44333,3
44333,They slide too easily.,44333,3
44334,Arrived much later than intended but cute bracelet.,44334,3
44334,Definitely not for anything long term wearing.,44334,3
44335,"Crystal is pretty, chain tarnished rather quickly.",44335,3
44336,"The fabric is polyester, which is clearly marked, but it just didn't feel too great to me.",44336,3
44336,The skirt is WAY too long.,44336,3
44336,You'll have to get it hemmed unless you are over 5'8 at least.,44336,3
44336,I ended up returning it.,44336,3
44337,It stands up taller than I expected.,44337,3
44337,I keep bumping it into things.,44337,3
44337,Good quality and arrived on time.,44337,3
44338,I get why everyone raves about these.,44338,3
44338,"They are comfortable, but they're not that great and here's my theory why everyone loves them: Most men are used to the all-cotton boxers or briefs you can find at any clothing store.",44338,3
44338,"Cotton will absorb moisture, but it doesn't release it well.",44338,3
44338,So things get swampy down there and the cotton chafes.,44338,3
44338,These are just the first decent pair of underwear for a lot of men.,44338,3
44338,"The pouch is comfortable, but not so much if you're sitting down all day.",44338,3
44338,The main thing that makes these comfortable (over common underwear) is the material.,44338,3
44338,"Do yourself a favor - by all means, try these, but also try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Champion-Men-s-Tech-Performance-Long-Leg-Boxer-Brief-Black-Large/dp/B00ISRCJYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Champion Men's Tech Performance Long Leg Boxer Brief, Black, Large</a>&nbsp;which I believe are the best out there, even better than the Saxx.",44338,3
44338,They're less than half the price of these.,44338,3
44338,"Would've been 4 stars for these, but the hype is just too much already.",44338,3
44339,"I was so glad they had this in large sizes, it actually fits, but it is not a long as I would like.",44339,3
44339,"it also doesn't have that hourglass shape to it at all, so it doesn't quite do what I had hoped with the ""waist training""....",44339,3
44340,"It is a very pretty dress, but it is much shorter than expected.",44340,3
44340,It looks like a lovely dress for a shorter person (I'm 5'9).,44340,3
44340,The fabric is just okay,44340,3
44341,"Really love it, bout have only had about 4 months and the handles have ""Chips"" in the color",44341,3
44342,Too small but great looking shirt if fit.,44342,3
44342,Not for long waisted men!,44342,3
44343,Just needed a watch until I got a free Gear Fit.,44343,3
44343,"It's BIG, kinda macho looking.",44343,3
44343,Cool w a black ring.,44343,3
44343,#'s are a little dim but great price,44343,3
44344,Very Narrow...not made for a wider foot.,44344,3
44345,Too small and i workout.,44345,3
44345,I like to breathe so this a no go for me.,44345,3
44346,Really cute but seems a like on the smallish side.,44346,3
44347,These are fairly tight.,44347,3
44347,"Probably work well for actual dance, etc., but not comfy for just sitting around.",44347,3
44347,I bought them to protect bottoms of my feet while moisturizing but they are too tight to wear for long.,44347,3
44349,Stick with Active Basic Cami Tanks on Amazon.,44349,3
44349,The colors are cute though but the straps are very weak and thin.,44349,3
44349,Won't last long :-(,44349,3
44350,It's way shorter in person than in the picture.,44350,3
44350,"I'' 5'6"" and am able to pull it down to cover my butt but no idea if it will stay there during the day.",44350,3
44351,"Just like the product name, it's basically a poncho.",44351,3
44351,"No shape to it at all like the photo and it made me look big, so I sent it back.",44351,3
44351,"The color and fabric were nice, it just wasn't flattering.",44351,3
44352,"It is a really fun idea, but you have to be super tiny to wear it.",44352,3
44353,Love the dress and material.,44353,3
44353,"Only sad part is that i odered a Xl,and because it stretches a Large would of fit better",44353,3
44354,Horrible at keeping time.,44354,3
44354,Is off anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes every 24 hours,44354,3
44355,I do like to rate it 5 stars if i got the case for it too.,44355,3
44355,The first one i bought came with case but for the 2nd was not.,44355,3
44356,Size was to large,44356,3
44358,These are extremely comfortable but stretch out within a short time of wear.,44358,3
44358,I would suggest ordering a smaller size.,44358,3
44359,Perfect fit got it one size bigger,44359,3
44360,Runs a bit smaller than one would think but it's ok.,44360,3
44361,"These are really big, and they stretch out really fast.... which is odd....because they are big.",44361,3
44361,I would assume they wouldn't need to stretch anymore.,44361,3
44361,"But alas, I was mistaken.",44361,3
44362,One of the straps broke within a month of light use.,44362,3
44363,"I like this item but every time I put it on, I take it off again.",44363,3
44363,"In the picture, on the model, this dress does not reach ankle or floor length, but mine does, so unless I wear high shoes (which I don't), it drags ever so slightly on the floor which, of course, shouldn't happen.",44363,3
44363,"So that I can wear, I would need to get altered.",44363,3
44364,"Pretty Bling,, but looks too dressy,, yes dressy for everyday wearing around the house.. price,, well who could go wrong..",44364,3
44364,"I think it's too much for me, being older, and looking like I'm going out someplace special.",44364,3
44364,"Nice feeling, but too too much bling for me..",44364,3
44365,It was a great fit ant I love the design but I only wore it one day and the picture looks like it's cracking already.,44365,3
44366,"The length is fine, but the width is a bit narrow.",44366,3
44366,"My little toes are on the trim piece and not inside, making them less than an ideal fit.",44366,3
44366,"None  the less, as slippers go, these do have more overall padding in the foot bed, so they still feel good to my feet.",44366,3
44366,There is no true arch support.,44366,3
44367,Other reviews stated to buy larger as it runs small.,44367,3
44367,"I did as suggested, as they were correct.",44367,3
44367,Also the product does shrink some when washed as well.,44367,3
44367,"I was hoping it would be softer then it was, but it is for a costume and it fit the bill perfectly.",44367,3
44368,loved it had to give it away way too small,44368,3
44369,Not as cute as the picture,44369,3
44370,The blouse was to small for me otherwise I liked it.,44370,3
44372,Size descriptions are accurate... order according to their side recommendations.,44372,3
44372,"The XXL fits like a women's L.

The print looks exactly the same as the picture, but it's printed on some kind of blended fabric, with not so much as a tag with a brand or wash instructions.",44372,3
44372,It's not your typical cotton blend...,44372,3
44372,The polyester content is a bit high for my tastes.,44372,3
44372,I was expecting a predominantly cotton blend.,44372,3
44372,Which is why I rate this product three stars.,44372,3
44373,The pattern is far more apparent in real life than I expected.,44373,3
44373,"That's not a bad thing, and likely the fault of my computer's display, but never-the-less it's not what I expected.",44373,3
44373,"The skirt is a little on the heavy side, and a little long on a petite frame, but the cut is really nice and the overall appearance of the skirt is attractive.",44373,3
44374,It was ok for the money but shamrocks were glue on backwards.,44374,3
44375,"It Is acceptable
But it is a little bit larger",44375,3
44376,"They go in the nose easily, and lays flat so it's undetectable.",44376,3
44376,The con is that they fall out just as easy so if you do purchase be careful.,44376,3
44376,I lost the first one I put in in just 2 hours while rubbing moisturizer on my face.,44376,3
44377,Great for the price.,44377,3
44377,Not as durable as I would like.,44377,3
44378,Under layer is fitted while over lay is flowy.,44378,3
44378,The under layer material does not have any give so I had to have a seamstress take it out and actually add material to the side seams underneath just so I could breath comfortably.,44378,3
44378,I bought it to my measurements so I'm not sure why the dress was so tight.,44378,3
44378,"I ordered a size 8, but they requested my exact measurements and wrote size 6 on the tag.",44378,3
44379,the Louis Vuitton name on wallet looks worn off,44379,3
44380,Quality of material could be nicer,44380,3
44381,"I was hoping for a better quality product, the padding is not removable.",44381,3
44381,The padding makes noise when I move.,44381,3
44381,The material feels cheap.,44381,3
44381,"The bra does fit well, if you don't need the padding and can sew then it would work for you.",44381,3
44382,"Not a very flattering look, but very comfortable for running errands or around the house.",44382,3
44382,"Wish it were a V-neck and that the buttons didn't look so cheap, but the price was right.",44382,3
44382,Arms could be cut a bit looser.,44382,3
44382,Washes well without fading.,44382,3
44383,I didn't notice that the rim of the jewels are a gold color.,44383,3
44383,I don't like the gold color at all.,44383,3
44383,The delivery was quick.,44383,3
44384,"It's great, might wanna order one size bigger since its.",44384,3
44385,"The socks are thick and warm enough for my husband to wear one pair of socks to work (in a refrigerator) instead of two, but two or three have unraveled around the top seam in an odd way.",44385,3
44385,"It's as if the material itself was unraveling, not just the actual seam.",44385,3
44385,"If not for that, they'd be perfect.",44385,3
44386,"The toes dig into you when you do certain poses, and it can be quite uncomfortable.",44386,3
44386,"The grips are nice, they give you added support even if you aren't using a yoga mat.",44386,3
44387,Love it but it is just too small.,44387,3
44388,Based on reviews I thought I'd better order an XS.,44388,3
44388,"But the problem I ran into is that while the bust area fit, the waist is a little snug.",44388,3
44388,"So while I don't think the Small would have fit at the bust portion, I have to rate this less.",44388,3
44388,"Also, the top does slide down because the ribbing does not hold it up long term.",44388,3
44388,"And the wrist ""gloves"" do not fit correctly around your arm.",44388,3
44388,I will wear this but am going to upgrade the accessories to make the outfit look better.,44388,3
44389,This particular order was returned due to the sole lifting up,44389,3
44390,The handcuff portion is a bit too large and/or thick.,44390,3
44390,It tends to get caught on the side of your wrist.,44390,3
44391,too small although I wear layered with other chains and it works out well.,44391,3
44392,"On first look, this jacket looked perfect, but when it arrived, I realized that something was wrong.",44392,3
44392,"The stitches were all messed up on the gold side, and the top fastener was missing entirely.",44392,3
44392,"I was kind of disappointed, but grateful that it was double sided.",44392,3
44392,"The navy blue side was pretty great and had all its fasteners, but the stitches were still a little off.",44392,3
44393,"nice, my husband is picky, it's fine for an over coat on a cool night",44393,3
44395,"Super cute swimsuit, but fit is weird.",44395,3
44395,"I am about 5'3"", 120 lbs, 32D (although I'm probably more a 30DD), 25"" waist, 35"" hips, and ordered a size small.",44395,3
44395,"The bottoms fit *slightly* loose, but its okay, and as other reviewers have said it is quite cheeky.",44395,3
44395,I would probably be keeping the bikini if the bottoms were the only issue.,44395,3
44395,"For me, the main problem I had was with the top.",44395,3
44395,The cups are quite small and do not fit my breasts.,44395,3
44395,They are also awkwardly far apart (although I suppose this is the way its supposed to look?),44395,3
44395,and so my breast tissue is being squished beneath the underwire.,44395,3
44395,"Also, the top/band is too wide for my rib cage so there is wrinkling in the black part that does not look good.",44395,3
44395,"Additionally, the straps are much too long for me, even when I pull it as tight as I can.",44395,3
44395,"Overall, I am rather disappointed because aside from the fit, the suit is really pretty.",44395,3
44395,"I think that perhaps if someone was taller than I was, and had a wider body and smaller breasts (or doesn't mind their boobs being crushed by the underwire?",44395,3
44395,I noticed that in the model picture the breasts are not contained within the cups either) it would fit much better.,44395,3
44395,I will be returning these.,44395,3
44395,"On a side note, the delivery was fast, and I received exactly the product pictured in the 3rd photo.",44395,3
44396,"I had ordered as a XL, and the top is marked L/XL.",44396,3
44396,It is too small....,44396,3
44397,Size large is more like a size small,44397,3
44398,Ordered the same size as several other Carhartt jeans that I own and for some reason these are snug in every dimension and too long in the leg.,44398,3
44398,Extremely durable just like every other Carhartt product.,44398,3
44398,I have not noticed any color fade.,44398,3
44398,Just wish they had a little more room.,44398,3
44399,Not quite as shown on picture.,44399,3
44399,"The one I received is gold in tone, the center is greenish not aqua, and the birds and leaves are tiny and not colorful.",44399,3
44399,Quality overall is so-so.,44399,3
44399,Was cheap and shows it.,44399,3
44400,Size runs VERY SMALL.I ordered an Extra Large and it fits like a Medium.,44400,3
44401,It is much larger than I thought.,44401,3
44401,I'm 5'7 & weigh 140 lbs.,44401,3
44401,I bought large and it was bigger than I'd like.,44401,3
44401,But it's very cute for the price.,44401,3
44401,And the fabric doesn't look cheap at all.,44401,3
44401,I was not paid or asked to leave a review.,44401,3
44401,I like to leave reviews on all of my things because I'm a mom and love cheap deals :) Would buy again just wish sizing was better.,44401,3
44402,Expected it to be longer but fit everywhere else!,44402,3
44403,The printing on them made them stiff and not very comfortable.,44403,3
44404,Longer than expected and scratches easily,44404,3
44405,Look nice not much stretch,44405,3
44406,Necklace is very pretty.,44406,3
44406,The chain is a little thick for the size of the cross in my opinion.,44406,3
44406,"Also the chain does not have a loop on the end to put the hook into to clasp it, so it basically hooks into a chain link.",44406,3
44406,It is a little hard to hook.,44406,3
44406,Also the edges are sharp and a little rough.,44406,3
44406,If you have a cleavage it tends to get caught there and the sharp edges are uncomfortable.,44406,3
44406,"Hopefully, if I wear it more, it will smooth out some.",44406,3
44406,"But for the price, it is a nice looking necklace and I don't regret buying it nor would I want to return it.",44406,3
44407,"It's ok, got two, however they are not perfectly round, one is a little oblong more than the other.",44407,3
44408,I was slightly disappointed.,44408,3
44408,"It is really not sewn well, but it is pretty and fits nice.",44408,3
44408,"My mom sews well and will have to do some fixing on it, but that will probably make it just how I want it!",44408,3
44409,"If you have hips, it will make you look bigger because of the side pockets",44409,3
44410,"Sizing is more a US 8-10 size to small for the woman size 14 to 16 ,
Print is pretty , gave it away to a person that is a size 8 ,and it fit her well",44410,3
44411,"They were a little too bit and wide on the sides, I have a small face so I think it didn't look good on me although, I did get many compliments.",44411,3
44411,I will return these.,44411,3
44412,Cute bit took over a month to arrive.,44412,3
44412,Materia is not soft but its ok.,44412,3
44413,It wasn't as expected,44413,3
44414,"it's bright red, very nice besides the buttons which seem a little tacky.",44414,3
44415,"it looks exactly how it looked in the pictures on here , it came next day as expected and the top is amazing because I have big boobs , only thing
WRONG IS  that im curvy so the bottoms are absolutely too small",44415,3
44416,This dress was a bit baggy.,44416,3
44416,The material is cottony with a bit of stretch.,44416,3
44416,It does not sit as nicely as the model but I'm going to get mine fixed.,44416,3
44416,"It is not going to wow you but it can work as a ""go to the mall"" dress.",44416,3
44416,I have not worn mine yet.,44416,3
44417,Materials are a bit on the thin side.,44417,3
44418,"Much larger and longer than I thought I would be, But still a cute shirt.",44418,3
44419,Pants are super cute!,44419,3
44419,"I hesitate to say that are somewhat large because it is only the top part of the pants that are the problem - they like to slide down, which in turn pushes the crotch & legs down a bit.",44419,3
44419,"Even when only walking on the treadmill or stretching after a workout, the waist band slips down.",44419,3
44419,"No snags or tears, even after my dogs have jumped on my legs, but they are not my ""go-to"" pair when heading to the gym due to the inconvenience of constantly needing to pull them up.",44419,3
44420,Perfect size for traveling.,44420,3
44420,Well made and fits the essentials including the iPhone 6P.,44420,3
44421,They were pretty tough to walk in.,44421,3
44422,Is ok por cople a month,44422,3
44423,The product fits OK for the most part except on the butt area.,44423,3
44423,I do not have a big booty so there really should be no problem with the fit there but there is no elasticity to the area and I thought it would be a cheeky fit but it is not.,44423,3
44424,It fits kind of large.,44424,3
44424,The large fits more like an XL.,44424,3
44425,I got this specifically for an outfit that would show the front straps.,44425,3
44425,I do like the look of it when it is essentially covered.,44425,3
44425,In white you can see through the bra to removable padding.,44425,3
44425,It fits super snug under the arms only.,44425,3
44425,I am a 36 B and it still pushes me flat.,44425,3
44425,It is not made out of what I can only describe is pure cotton.,44425,3
44425,No real stretch like you would expect from say a sports bra or a crop top.,44425,3
44426,"Love this shirts and designs, but the white one came with a strange brown stain on the back.",44426,3
44426,I tried washing it to see if it would come out with no luck.,44426,3
44426,"Otherwise I do like the product, just disappointed by the mystery stain.",44426,3
44427,Doesn't appear to be authentic.,44427,3
44427,The writing has smeared off on the shades.,44427,3
44428,I have sewn for years and found the material to be of good quality.,44428,3
44428,"I ordered a total of 3, an extra size larger due to previous reviews.",44428,3
44428,I was thrilled when they arrived because believe it or not it is difficult to find a dressy white blouse at a reasonable price.,44428,3
44428,The fit was fine and I was ready to walk out the door when my daughter stopped me.,44428,3
44428,She had me look in her 3 way mirror.,44428,3
44428,The hem was totally skewed.,44428,3
44428,Had to return all three.,44428,3
44429,The quality seemed good but the size was at least 3 size smaller than labeled.,44429,3
44429,The XXXL size was really a L size.,44429,3
44431,WAY WAY too big.,44431,3
44431,More like a ladies size than a kids size,44431,3
44432,Not a bad pair.,44432,3
44432,The straps wear a little long.,44432,3
44432,Then again I suffer from no ass syndrome.,44432,3
44432,Cool pouch idea feels comfy upfront,44432,3
44433,"These are beautiful clips, but when I put them on the shoe, the clasp broke.",44433,3
44433,The time to return them has passed.,44433,3
44434,It is made out of cheap material it isn't going to be that one sweater you like to throw on to get all comfy,44434,3
44435,"they fit large legs, reg length just fits at shoe edge on the top and I'm 5'1, so not really long.",44435,3
44435,extra room in the body,44435,3
44436,I really loved the costume but it was to big and I went by the size chart,44436,3
44437,"Because of the material, the dress doesn't have too much give.",44437,3
44437,I actually have a non maternity dress that's exactly like this and got more comfortably bc of the material.,44437,3
44437,"It fit well during the small period of time I was the right size, but I couldn't got in it comfortably at the end of my pregnancy",44437,3
44438,I ordered 12-18months for my baby who wears 12 months in Carters size and some 18 months but it was WAY too big.,44438,3
44438,12-18 months is more the size of 24 months.,44438,3
44438,The material is cheap and super thin like those cheap costumes you buy for Halloween.,44438,3
44438,I ended up having to buy a much cuter and better quality suit from Burlington Coat Factory and it was cheaper than this too.,44438,3
44438,My package was also a day late.,44438,3
44438,I will be returning this product and not ordering again.,44438,3
44439,I am 5'1 petite 100 lbs.,44439,3
44439,"I ordered a small, the bottoms fit nicely but the top fit a little too snug around my ribs.",44439,3
44439,"I am among the smaller breast sizes, so this cup size was perfect.",44439,3
44439,"I ordered another in a Medium, bottoms were kind of big, the straps to the top fit comfortably, but the cup size were too big for me.",44439,3
44440,very small had to give away,44440,3
44441,will not order again,44441,3
44442,These gloves are super cute but they she'd a lot!!,44442,3
44442,"Other wise my daughter likes them, they're warm but something needs to be done about the shedding.",44442,3
44443,The hood portion is for style only and is way too small.,44443,3
44443,The string in the hood looks like cheap rope.,44443,3
44444,Fits as expected however all the comments said it came with removable cups and mine did not!,44444,3
44444,Would of been nice to have removable cups!,44444,3
44444,Overall...not really like the pics shown.,44444,3
44445,Luckily I only got them for a photo shoot.,44445,3
44446,"Interesting concept, but it fits the wrist awkwardly.",44446,3
44448,doesn't fit needs to be made bigger,44448,3
44449,"I found the waist very high and tight and the legs too short for my 5' 7"" frame at 130 lbs.",44449,3
44450,Cool looking but awkward fit.,44450,3
44450,Even on a guy's face it fits weird.,44450,3
44451,the strap kept coming off while she was wearing them so it made them more of a hazard ...I used two safety pins to keep the straps on,44451,3
44452,I got the glasses with the purple/blue lens and black frame.,44452,3
44452,Its super cute and really nice.,44452,3
44452,I LOVE that it came in a really nice case and cleaning cloth.,44452,3
44452,"My only complaint is that it came ""damaged"".",44452,3
44452,One of the corner triangle gem things came off when I took it out of the plastic and the case.,44452,3
44452,"It's no big deal and can be fixed easily, but I would have liked it so much more if it came in perfect condition.",44452,3
44453,Fits a little smaller then I wanted it to but for the price its a good buy!,44453,3
44454,I have very thick thighs and these tend to ride up and chaff...,44454,3
44456,Does not look like photo too much hair,44456,3
44457,Not nearly as colorful as pictured but they are cute,44457,3
44458,I ordered the proper size for my 4 y o (she's 32# so I ordered 4T) and it is really big on her.,44458,3
44458,"The shorts stay on her slender hips but they are long, going just past her knees.",44458,3
44458,The top is somewhat boxy and obviously too big for her.,44458,3
44458,"They are soft to the touch and so far, wash/dry well.",44458,3
44458,She likes them and doesn't mind how large they are.,44458,3
44458,"The good news, I guess, is that she'll have summer pajamas for next year, too.",44458,3
44459,Made for little people.,44459,3
44459,Too small all the way around.,44459,3
44459,Small cups and I ordered 2 sizes up.,44459,3
44459,Tight around the arms and back.,44459,3
44459,Wish they would of fit bought 3 of them..,44459,3
44460,Not the material I was expecting and much too large.,44460,3
44462,I love the pattern but it is starting to come unstitched (& I have had a little over a month.),44462,3
44463,I had ordered the exact size that my son-in-law already had but these were too small and I had to return for the next larger size.,44463,3
44463,The new pants were fine but wish the sizing was more consistent.,44463,3
44465,"This ring was really cute, however it was so small that I had a lot of trouble getting it on my ear...and then I spent a good 30 min trying to get the ball in after finally getting it in my ear just to have the ball fall and get lost.",44465,3
44466,"Fair warning, these tops run small, so order bigger by at least one size",44466,3
44467,The material is  not flattering.,44467,3
44468,The glasses are a nice style just a little wide for my head.,44468,3
44468,Other than that they are great!,44468,3
44468,They are definitely polarized too.,44468,3
44469,The shirt is very boxy.,44469,3
44469,The large is more like a medium.,44469,3
44469,"I haven't washed/dried it yet, still deciding if it's worth the hassle to return and re-order.",44469,3
44470,pretty but runs really small.,44470,3
44471,It's a very pretty piece of jewelry.,44471,3
44471,The problem is its very gaudy.,44471,3
44471,So I would only recomend this if thats what your going for or if you happen to have a big nose.,44471,3
44472,Fine for the price.,44472,3
44472,Material is okay but not great.,44472,3
44472,I would size up at least two sizes.,44472,3
44472,The large fits like a small.,44472,3
44473,"Dress arrived, looks and feels of beautiful quality but I recommend ordering up a few sizes.",44473,3
44473,I ordered up 1 size based on size chart and was still far too small.,44473,3
44474,"It may be that I have long arms, but these are not adult size.",44474,3
44474,Lucky I will be using them for a small pre teen.,44474,3
44475,Nice material  just that it was way too small.,44475,3
44475,Gave it so a Christmas gift.,44475,3
44476,"These are quite nice for the price and I wear frequently just to run around doing errands, out to lunch and a dress up event.",44476,3
44476,"They are a bit heavy and since my ears are thin, I do not wear but for a few hours.",44476,3
44476,"With my rose gold watch, somewhat dressy, they all look nice together.",44476,3
44477,Very small unless you're 8 -10. years old don't order,44477,3
44478,Did not fit as expected but nice product.,44478,3
44479,The blouse could be very petty but made with cheap material and  Poor stitching .,44479,3
44480,Fitting wasn't a problem since I went by chart now the finishing quality wasn't there for me so will be returning.,44480,3
44482,too large and bulky,44482,3
44483,"Love the tank top and the style, but the fit runs small.",44483,3
44483,"I would say order a larger size, unless you normally wear bigger than an XL, then, I wouldn't bother.",44483,3
44483,"I normally wear a L, but this XL is too small for me!",44483,3
44484,I had to return the stress this dress it was way too see through for me you could actually see my nipples and if I were to wear a bra under it so that was a no go.,44484,3
44486,Not as large as in the picture.,44486,3
44487,It's cute but runs way small.,44487,3
44487,It's basically child sized.,44487,3
44488,"After awhile, it will start to bend a little out of shape and fit different.",44488,3
44488,The bottom will start to stick outwards making it impossible to hide under fitted clothing.,44488,3
44488,"I did notice great results after consistently wearing it but after not wearing it for a while, the results fade away.",44488,3
44489,Not what I expected at all.,44489,3
44489,"Thought it would be a super cute, pretty stylish top.",44489,3
44489,"I bought this a year or so ago, and I've never worn it.",44489,3
44489,It's cheap and pretentious.,44489,3
44489,The sleeves might look cute in the picture but they look really bad in real life.,44489,3
44490,The shirt is cute and fits fine; but it's not the one pictured.,44490,3
44490,"I got the ""Hi my name is barbie' shirt.",44490,3
44490,In the picture it looks like a cotton shirt with a collar but actually the shirt I recieved is just a cut out of a polyester and spandex.,44490,3
44490,I was a bit disapointed.,44490,3
44490,There's no sewn hems just two cut outs sewn together.,44490,3
44490,It's still a cute shirt but it's not as lightweight and breathable as I would have liked.,44490,3
44490,Also the color of the lable is darker more like fucshia than hot pink.,44490,3
44490,It almost looks red sometimes.,44490,3
44491,The luggage looks nice and stylish however the pieces are not reinforced as normal luggage.,44491,3
44491,The first time i used it the handle of the roller carry-on broke but that was probably just a faulty one.,44491,3
44492,After one use we found a small hole near the ankle of one sock.,44492,3
44493,"I've washed these capris once, maybe twice and they're already pilling between the thighs and along the stitching.",44493,3
44493,"Disappointed with that, and I expected better quality.",44493,3
44493,I do like the hidden pocket in the waistband.,44493,3
44493,"Also, these fit a bit snug.",44493,3
44494,I bought a size large wanting it to fit a little looser.,44494,3
44494,it flows nice and is long enough to cover slightly past my active wear pant line.,44494,3
44494,"was expecting slightly more of an activewear material and it is a little thinner than I expected, but overall I am happy with my purchase.",44494,3
44494,haven't washed them yet.. so I hope they don't shrink shorter!,44494,3
44494,"(they say handwash cold which I am not super excited about)

update: i have washed them since i rated 4 stars and am disappointed they shrunk in length.",44494,3
44494,will still wear around the houe and for pajamas.. but now too short for working out,44494,3
44495,the sizing is not forgiving for broad shouldered men.,44495,3
44495,Or Men in larger sizes.,44495,3
44496,"The quality wasn't the best but I wore this a couple of times
My friend ended up borrowing it from me and it looked good on her so I let her have it cause I didn't really like the material
But it's a cute and simple bikini
Runs a little small",44496,3
44497,Gave as a gift.,44497,3
44499,XL fits like a MED.,44499,3
44500,The size runs small.,44500,3
44501,I know is random selection but I was expecting something like the picture,44501,3
44502,Came in and seems the sizes run a little larger.,44502,3
44503,"Dress was a little large and too long on me, but after washing it, the fabric shrank and fits fine now.",44503,3
44503,The fabric does not feel like cotton linen.,44503,3
44503,"Nice color, good price and value though.",44503,3
44504,The purse is cute.,44504,3
44504,I wouldn't recommend everyday use because it is made kinda cheap.,44504,3
44505,"It is light, and cheaply made as expected considering the price.",44505,3
44506,I should know better the products from China run small and I am not small.,44506,3
44506,"But, not so small I can't wear, just tight in the boob area and hips.",44506,3
44506,Very cute shirt for little folks.,44506,3
44507,"It fit's the 6 cards perfectly, but if you try to put anything else in there, it will not stay clasped/closed.",44507,3
44507,It is about half an inch thick with hard edges which cause a significant bulge in pocket for front pocket carriers like myself.,44507,3
44507,"I like the look and style of this wallet, however the functionality is lacking for me personally.",44507,3
44508,Size was 15-17 I believe but it is really tight.,44508,3
44508,I'm generally a 13/14 so I was a little disappointed.,44508,3
44508,It's not terrible though so I'll keep it.,44508,3
44509,"Great color, nice fit, good quality, but not a dress.",44509,3
44509,Looks longer in the picture.,44509,3
44509,"On me, tunic for sure.",44509,3
44510,First off be aware of the shipping time.,44510,3
44510,It took a lot time for mine to arrive it looks like it is available via prime now so that might not be a problem anymore.,44510,3
44510,I mean technically the time it took to ship was not a problem for me but I just wanted to warn anyone that might want this item for a specific occasion and whatnot.,44510,3
44510,I read other reviews that said this item ran small for them but it runs large for me around the underarm area.,44510,3
44510,I am Asian and all these other reviews talks about it being Asian sized and whatnot but that wasn't true for me.,44510,3
44510,I normally wear between a S or M depending on the article of clothing so I ordered a S for this dress and it ended up being quite loose around the under arm area and it does hang low under the armpits as well.,44510,3
44510,I feel like if I don't wear the right bra for this I will be showing a lot of side boob.,44510,3
44510,I think in order for me to wear this I would need to wear a wrap around bra one of those bandeau bras.,44510,3
44510,Which isn't a super big deal to me because I have one but just FYI.,44510,3
44510,"The other thing is I think their coloring names is wrong because as you can see the picture of the ""red"" dress is more like an orange.",44510,3
44510,I thought maybe that was just a photo issue but it really comes as a neon orange color.,44510,3
44510,But overall it's an okay dress.,44510,3
44510,For the price I'm not going to be super picky about it.,44510,3
44510,I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,44510,3
44511,"These tights are nice, but don't expect too much out of the Spanx portion of the tights.",44511,3
44511,"I'm short, so these tights ran on the longer side, which I expected.",44511,3
44511,"But, they sell these tights as having this unique Spanx portion that will help.",44511,3
44511,"But, it doesn't help that much at all.",44511,3
44511,"In fact, if you are looking for that I'd just recommend wearing a pair of Spanx with a pair of regular tights as this just won't get it done.",44511,3
44512,"Comfortable, but too sheer",44512,3
44514,"I am 5'6, 115lb, 32 B (small), I have an average size bum.",44514,3
44514,"The bathing suite fit well on the bottom, came up the shoulder perfectly.",44514,3
44514,The problem is on the bust area.,44514,3
44514,I recommend buying this suit if you have a large bust.,44514,3
44514,It is th honest truth.,44514,3
44514,"If you do not have a large bust, your measurement around your body (the number before your cup size) must be bigger to fill in the bust area.",44514,3
44514,I do not recommend purchasing this suite before a big trip.,44514,3
44514,"You will want to buy many options and try them all, with enough time to exchange or return.",44514,3
44515,"The hat fits fine, but there is not enough material/fabric for the hat to be baggy/lose in the back.",44515,3
44515,"I bought it because I liked the way that looked in the picture, and disappointed that it doesn't really look like that.",44515,3
44515,It looks like a regula beanie with a visor.,44515,3
44516,good fabric for spring .. the size is good but the size of sleeve is short,44516,3
44517,Top fit as expected.,44517,3
44517,The bottom were way to small,44517,3
44518,Wish this would've fit!,44518,3
44519,"Okay so I'm a lover of a good VB product, and of their wristlets.",44519,3
44519,I decided to take my chances after reading the reviews to order it anyway.,44519,3
44519,"Unfortunately the reviews were right - the iPhone 6s+ does fit, but it's an extremely tight fit.",44519,3
44519,"I had a LifeProof FRE series case on and it wasn't going to go in, then I changed into my VB case and it barely goes in.",44519,3
44519,The closure works but it's really not secure.,44519,3
44519,HOWEVER if you have an iPhone 6 (or 6s) you can buy this with no fears.,44519,3
44519,"Ultimately I'm torn on what I'll do with it, but as long as you DO NOT have a 6+ or 6s+ you'll be golden.",44519,3
44520,"I ordered one blue necklace,  and one purple necklace  and I received 2 purple",44520,3
44521,"Not sure, bought as Christmas gift",44521,3
44522,"I have very large breasts 36g so I was hoping I could just take the padding out, but it is a structured suit so it was a built in.",44522,3
44522,But it was really cute.,44522,3
44522,They refunded me the money fast.,44522,3
44523,Much smaller than I thought it would be.,44523,3
44523,I can hardly see the design.,44523,3
44524,There is nothing special about this item.,44524,3
44524,It's a little long wasted for me but I decided to keep it.,44524,3
44526,looks good but feels weird..just not too comfortable in this shirt.,44526,3
44527,This is comfortable; soft t-shirt material.,44527,3
44527,I got purple and find that it attracts lint and or pet hair like a magnet.,44527,3
44527,I get one wear and then needs to be washed.,44527,3
44527,As others have said it is a bit long - I am 5' 2''.,44527,3
44527,Even tho it is comfortable I probably wouldn't purchase this again.,44527,3
44528,I ordered a size 6-9 months for my 5 months old baby.,44528,3
44528,Thinking that I should get it a little bigger seeing how she's growing and just in case it's too small.,44528,3
44528,It was actually way too big.,44528,3
44528,Would fit more like a 1 year old.,44528,3
44528,I decided to keep it and not return it because she can grow into it.,44528,3
44528,"I washed it and when I took it out of the washer, the bow that's on the shirt was detached.",44528,3
44528,It should have been made better and fit better.,44528,3
44529,I ordered a small and it feels like there's so much material that it actually feels heavy on.,44529,3
44529,"After I washed in cold water delicate cycle and hung dry, the material softened and shrunk a bit so now it feels a little less like I'm wearing a blanket!",44529,3
44529,The waist and around the bust is more fitted after it shrunk up a bit.,44529,3
44529,There is a built in slip so it's not see through.,44529,3
44529,The pink or blush color is subtle with the white thread.,44529,3
44530,"pants are a completely different color - instead of a muted bluish green as depicted, they are a bright aqua.",44530,3
44530,"Quite thick, but yarn is very soft and the quality of the knit/crochet is good",44530,3
44531,It was not the comfortable loose fit I experienced with the Pattern Hip-Hop Cap,44531,3
44532,More of a grey color than white and slightly small but a great look and style,44532,3
44534,A little small when I wore it.,44534,3
44534,It starts to hurt my shoulders after wearing it.,44534,3
44535,"straps will not support heavier breasts like a C cup and up, these are cute for A-B cups.",44535,3
44536,They are cute but comes off his little feet very easily.,44536,3
44536,.They need a top on them to hold them on.,44536,3
44537,Person wearing this mask had hard time seeing through the eye areas of the mask.,44537,3
44537,Vendor transaction was a AAA+,44537,3
44538,The top is too small and the bottom is just a little large.,44538,3
44538,"If you are a larger breasted woman but have a normal BMI (not overweight), this swim suit probably will not fit right.",44538,3
44538,"It's cute on, but I wish there was more breast room, the top is a B cup at best (I'm a D) and the bottom is a little large (my back side definitely warrants at least a medium in every other swim suit) and I ordered a medium.",44538,3
44538,I'm still going to squeeze my breast into b/c I'm too lazy to return.,44538,3
44539,I purchased this pendant to hold pills that I take most days.,44539,3
44539,"And although most of those pills are small, even the smallest wouldn't fit in the pendant.",44539,3
44540,Too big for my skinny tie,44540,3
44541,I returned it because it was too small.,44541,3
44542,"Fit is good, but crotch had a hole in it after one wear.",44542,3
44543,"not like photo, way more boxy and loose in the wrong places.",44543,3
44544,It's beautiful just don't like how the rhinestones catch on the dress,44544,3
44545,Product needs to have thread string ends plastic tipped (like shoe laces) for threading through very tight (small) side loops.,44545,3
44545,Too lengthy a process to assemble and difficult for wife to stop laughing!,44545,3
44545,"Will have to get really tossed to attempt again, zippers?",44545,3
44546,I have had my Upsie Belly for about a week now and used it several times for short periods.,44546,3
44546,I am currently on modified bedrest due to severe SPD and sacroiliac joint instability- aka: chronic pelvic pain.,44546,3
44546,I have yet to decide if this device is even worth the money.,44546,3
44546,"It's comfortable enough while standing and walking, meaning it's soft and not invasive.",44546,3
44546,"But, I don't know that it's really helping me when I wear it.",44546,3
44546,"Though, I don't know that is a fair assement with my condition, considering I'm in pain all the time and no therapies are working.",44546,3
44546,I don't expect the thing to work miracles.,44546,3
44546,"For size reasons I will say I am 5'8"", 34 weeks pregnant, 162lbs and wearing a medium comfortably.",44546,3
44546,"I'm sure a small would have also fit, but my baby is still hanging out in my ribs- which is another reason why this may not feel super supportive.",44546,3
44546,If she was lower I wouldn't be able to get the upsie near as tight.,44546,3
44546,"I do think the medium will be too big after I give birth, as I am able to tighten it pretty far now.",44546,3
44546,"I find that it's very uncomfortable while sitting, and because of how low I need support and how high my baby is still it presses right on my bladder.",44546,3
44546,One thing I do like is the pocket for the heat pack.,44546,3
44546,It doesn't stay hot for very long (10-15 minutes) but it's nice to be able to keep the heat right where I need it.,44546,3
44546,Will update after more use and if I decide to return.,44546,3
44546,I'm leaning toward returning and getting something better for postpartum support instead.,44546,3
44546,As this is a spendy product and doesn't seem to be doing its money's worth at this time.,44546,3
44547,"This is a shoe I will wear with black dress pants or jeans when I need comfort and a little style, but I am not impressed.",44547,3
44547,This is a very flimsy shoe with little support at all.,44547,3
44547,Not like any Nike I've ever purchased in the past.,44547,3
44547,"It looks nice, but it's not comfortable.",44547,3
44549,"The fitting is a little loose but you get used to it, and the threads tighten up after each wash. After a couple washs, I think mine got caught on a zipper and created a hole.",44549,3
44550,Beautiful case but the color faded and got quickly dirty/smudgy in less than two days.,44550,3
44551,its a cute shoe but too large for my child.,44551,3
44551,I will have to return sadly!,44551,3
44552,Ordered the grey one (charcoal) and it fit fine in a medium.,44552,3
44552,Ordered the orange and it was too small,44552,3
44554,The jewel fell off... Make sure to tighten the metal loop so you don't get it snagged on something and lose the jewel.,44554,3
44555,Little shorter than I expected,44555,3
44556,I got a size 3XL.,44556,3
44556,They did fit as I was expecting them to fit.,44556,3
44556,My only issue is the color.,44556,3
44556,"They're listed as 'orange', shown as more a 'yellow-orange', and when they arrived, they're super bright NEON orange.",44556,3
44556,I was expecting the color to be more muted as shown in the photo.,44556,3
44556,"I know that colors can be off a bit, but this was beyond off.",44556,3
44557,"I see I am not the only one - this belt is great in many ways, but for some reason the ""onyx black"" body of the buckle itself scratches away really easily.",44557,3
44557,"In the end, mine was so bad I scraped it down to bare metal which looked better.",44557,3
44557,"Shame, because the belt itself is awesome...",44557,3
44558,Doesn't even begin to cover lower body parts...,44558,3
44558,I added shorts and tights and my boyfriend still loved it.,44558,3
44559,I bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day.,44559,3
44559,It arrived in time and looks great.,44559,3
44559,She really likes the roominess.,44559,3
44559,Problem with it is the accent jewelry is poorly fastened.,44559,3
44559,The clasps are loose so it fell off the first day of use.,44559,3
44559,I repaired it by closing all of the clasps tightly together.,44559,3
44559,Haven't had any other problems yet.,44559,3
44559,She has carried it for about 3 weeks now.,44559,3
44560,Cute and comfortable shoes.,44560,3
44560,"But the little X in the front was unstitched the first day my son wore them, and one of the little black buttons in the front came off.",44560,3
44560,"Not very good quality, but good for everything else.",44560,3
44561,Not as brightly colored as the photo in my opinion.,44561,3
44562,Love the design but was hoping the quality would be better.,44562,3
44562,Fabric pills very easily and isn't the same throughout the sweatshirt.,44562,3
44563,The style is very cute and the customer service is excellent.,44563,3
44563,"However, the coat runs very small so order up two sizes.",44563,3
44564,"Material is very  cheap,  I had tiny holes in the seam on my shirt.",44564,3
44564,I guess you get what you pay for.,44564,3
44565,Even a xlarge didn't fit my boobs well but this is always my problem with general size teddys.,44565,3
44566,I ordered this suit for my husband.,44566,3
44566,"Luckily, I read the reviews before purchasing that said it ran small.",44566,3
44566,We ordered the pants 2 sizes bigger than what he normally wears and they fit him great.,44566,3
44566,"The pants were very long though, so we had to get them tailored to his length.",44566,3
44567,This is adorable...but if you have a big bottom it will not fit properly.,44567,3
44567,"The inside of the skirt isn't long enough, and slowly rides up, exposing the button under the sheer fabric.",44567,3
44568,Forgot that this shirt was stretchy fabric.,44568,3
44568,Kind of wished it was cotton.,44568,3
44568,Should have read the item description; oh well.,44568,3
44568,Design is on front and back.,44568,3
44569,It fits okay for and average girl but with my DD's it is a little tight in the chest.,44569,3
44569,I somewhat expected that.,44569,3
44569,the only thing I don't like is the sleeves seem small.,44569,3
44569,They might not be but they keep going into my arm pit like they are true baby-doll tees but they cut of the shirt is not meant for them to fit that way.,44569,3
44570,bottoms were perfect top was way way to big,44570,3
44571,"Had to return, didn't fit",44571,3
44572,Brim is very large.,44572,3
44572,It's hard  to see in front of myself when walking.,44572,3
44573,"Is start to change color, and have the copper or brass smell already",44573,3
44574,The pants were a littte small in the waist and the pants were way to long.,44574,3
44575,Decent product and i understand it should fit snugly but I couldn't even close the snaps!,44575,3
44576,"Feels cheaply made, unfinished hems feel like it will fall apart after the first wash",44576,3
44577,Was tight on the shoulders,44577,3
44578,I did not read fabric content before purchasing  and was somewhat disappointed in the fabric.,44578,3
44578,It was slightly thick and not a real smooth feel.,44578,3
44580,"They fall out easily and are very noticeable, not inconspicuous like I had hoped.",44580,3
44581,"This watch, looks great, but scuffs super easy, the band broke within a few days of owning it, low quality for sure",44581,3
44582,I like the shirt.,44582,3
44582,Slightly see through and there is NO give in he fabric which makes taking it off slightly hard.,44582,3
44583,"Fabric is cheap, and does not look like in The pic
Dic not like it",44583,3
44584,"This is a really cute suit, but sizing is misleading.",44584,3
44584,"Bottoms fit fine (ordered 3x), but top cup size gaps and too large.",44584,3
44584,"If I had option to order  top a few sizes smaller, with the 3x bottoms, this would have worked out great.",44584,3
44585,made out of cheap cardboard and fabric.,44585,3
44586,"I liked the dress and the fabric, but it was way too small.",44586,3
44587,Love the product and concept.,44587,3
44587,"Very large but do ""work""",44587,3
44588,I wore this with a backless dress on a hot day.,44588,3
44588,"Because it was so warm outside and I may have been glistening a bit, the product did not remain adhered to my skin.",44588,3
44588,"I'm also a small B (maybe even an A), and the B was a little small, but it might have had less to do with the cup size and more to do with how narrow you must be for it to fit.",44588,3
44588,"I get that they're supposed to pull ""the girls"" together, but this seemed like a lot of pulling.",44588,3
44588,"The carrying case is a nice touch, though.",44588,3
44590,Very tight around the ankles and shorter than expected.,44590,3
44591,ALITTLE TOO SHINEY FOR MY TASTE AND NOT THE BEST QUALITY MATERIAL.,44591,3
44591,I ORDERED MY SIZE AND I COULDNT EVEN GET IT ON IT WAS SO SMALL.,44591,3
44592,"They were great, just a little small, it kept rolling up at the thigh part.",44592,3
44593,"Very nice, hold your tummy firmly, I weigh 180lb and I took a ml the tummy arts is perfect, however the buttock area a bit too small.",44593,3
44594,You get what you pay for!,44594,3
44594,I will use it for a swim cover.,44594,3
44595,Poor quality as expected from cheap product.,44595,3
44596,The hair around the top of wig is frizzy and u can see the cap underneath hair.,44596,3
44597,Got this for my boyfriend.,44597,3
44597,Cons- were that it is a bit on the thin side and sleeves weren't long enough.,44597,3
44597,Pros- looks exactly like the photo and looks fancy in pictures.,44597,3
44598,However the zipper broke on one after the first time I wore it.,44598,3
44599,cute but tear in the seams when washed,44599,3
44600,"Material is shiny, unlike the picture.",44600,3
44601,I like the zipper but it is NOT an extra long tie.,44601,3
44601,It is about the same length as a regular tie.,44601,3
44602,Bought these for my boyfriend for valentine's day  fast shipping... but they were tiny.,44602,3
44602,They were cheap enough that I just threw them away,44602,3
44603,"It's a beautiful vest, however, it is NOT the same Brown as pictured.",44603,3
44603,"Trying to purchase ties to go with it, the warehouses (multiple) are calling it ""orange"".",44603,3
44603,"It's not, but it's not the dark brown as pictured either.",44603,3
44603,It's a metallic type color.,44603,3
44603,"If I could post a picture to show actual color, I would.",44603,3
44603,"Purchase if you're okay with something lighter than pictured, don't purchase if you're needing it a deep brown.",44603,3
44604,"Cute dress,but easy to big!!!",44604,3
44604,Had to send it back.,44604,3
44604,Bust was very large.,44604,3
44604,"However, it would have been cute and given stars if it fit.",44604,3
44605,I like the fabric it is perfect for hot summer weather.,44605,3
44605,Its not like the picture.,44605,3
44605,Theres not alot of fabric.,44605,3
44605,It does not flow to the ground.,44605,3
44605,Im 5'4 it hits right at my ankles and i ware 36dd it is snug on top but wearable.,44605,3
44605,Overall i like it enough to wear it and keep it especially for the price.,44605,3
44607,"It's cute,  but broke after my 2nd time wearing it",44607,3
44608,Not well made really but pretty,44608,3
44609,"If you are in the top of the range for the waist measurement and have hips, you may have a difficult time getting this on.",44609,3
44610,The holes for the buttons were now sewn correctly.,44610,3
44610,All the hardware has to be assembled on your own.,44610,3
44610,"Cute design, runs small.",44610,3
44611,Love the design but it's tight on me need a 44,44611,3
44612,They are OK have warn them yet,44612,3
44613,Didn't like the Velcro closer and didn't fit my head well.,44613,3
44613,Well made and looks professional.,44613,3
44614,There are no holes on both sides for the buttons; I have to install the metal buckles.,44614,3
44614,The picture on Amazon page is not very clear.,44614,3
44614,The front part is kind of low.,44614,3
44615,Not very flattering front view but looks nice in profile,44615,3
44616,They run very small.,44616,3
44617,Material is like stretchy cloth material.,44617,3
44617,I really looks good in the picture on that body type.,44617,3
44617,I am not as curvy in the hip area.,44617,3
44617,It fits but a little loose.,44617,3
44617,"You can't really notice when you look at it, but I can feel it.",44617,3
44617,I haven't worn it yet to know if it rides down or not.,44617,3
44617,I measured myself and ordered a medium.,44617,3
44617,Cannot complain for the price.,44617,3
44618,I ordered a medium and wear a 34 B bra size.,44618,3
44618,I found it bit small at the bottom and noticed that it does rub a fair bit at the bottom zipper.,44618,3
44618,It's a shame because I was hoping to love this but can't.,44618,3
44618,I'll still wear it but not for intense workouts that require greater movement (and therefore greater rubbing and movement in the waist/ribs),44618,3
44619,Colors are not as vivid as depicted.,44619,3
44620,These sized run very small.,44620,3
44621,This watch was so cute when we got it.,44621,3
44621,"The wrist band is not the greatest quality, but and will probably need to be replaced soon, but the person I gave it to absolutely loves it.",44621,3
44621,He said it was a lot better than what it looked like online.,44621,3
44621,I would purchase another one.,44621,3
44622,One of the zippers broke the first time using it while on the trip.,44622,3
44623,Beautiful but size is to big for the woman perfect for the man,44623,3
44624,the symbol is great but the string used to tie it is a problem.,44624,3
44624,I had to cut them because I couldn't get them untied.,44624,3
44625,It was a beautiful phone case and it fit but the design could peel off,44625,3
44626,It was beatiful but it was too small for my 10 pound baby.,44626,3
44627,It is a lot more see through and shorter length  than i thought.,44627,3
44627,But it feels comfortable.,44627,3
44627,It looks larger than the size I ordered...I am keepimg it though.,44627,3
44628,They could be thicker.,44628,3
44628,But serve the purpose for the price,44628,3
44629,"Cute dress, very high quality, but the color, which looked like a peach in the picture, was too orange.",44629,3
44629,"Also, the chest was too big and just didn't fit right.",44629,3
44630,"I am 5'2 and 100lb it was large for me, so I didn't feel as comfortable wearing it since it was too loose.",44630,3
44630,If only they had size options that be alot better.,44630,3
44631,"Good size, not enough bend at the waist for hourglass shape.",44631,3
44632,The top rides up a lot .,44632,3
44632,I even ordered a bigger shirt so it would fit properly but even when I raise my arms up even a little the top goes with it  drastically..,44632,3
44633,"This band is ""so-so"".",44633,3
44633,"The velcro closure ends up being bumpy, so it can be seen under clothing.",44633,3
44633,"Also, for someone who is 5'7"", I wish it was a little bit longer.",44633,3
44634,Really bad quality and cheap material.,44634,3
44634,Especially the color is same but looks cheap because of the material.,44634,3
44634,I bought it in pink.,44634,3
44634,The arm is really big.,44634,3
44634,The fit is not that pretty.,44634,3
44634,I regret kind of buying it.,44634,3
44635,"Very cute, but it was way too big amd long on me.",44635,3
44635,It is a cute swimsuit though.,44635,3
44636,"I liked the dress on my computer but material very thin, see through thin.",44636,3
44636,I sent it back.,44636,3
44637,"Too long for my wrist, The brown one is cheap leather like material",44637,3
44638,I did not receive the exact one as shown in the picture.,44638,3
44638,It is still comfy.,44638,3
44639,"Quality, sturdy material and sexy style but unfortunately it runs small :(",44639,3
44640,I bought three different night dresses.,44640,3
44640,This one is my least favorite.,44640,3
44640,"The fabric isn't very soft and it shrinks a lot, made it alittle to short to wear without pants.",44640,3
44640,The other one I got has stretch to it with no shrinkage which I prefer.,44640,3
44641,Looks like Charlie Browns shirt.,44641,3
44641,"Did not fit as expected, wished it was a little more off the shoulder.",44641,3
44642,While I hoped that this would be larger (even ordering the XXL) sadly it's not.,44642,3
44642,"It's still great for weekends and hanging around the house and wearing over a tank top, but the sleeves are only 3/4 sleeves (at least on me) and the neck is far too narrow to be an 'oversized' sweater.",44642,3
44642,"I'll keep it cause it's light weight and can be cute, but it's not Oversized at all and that makes me sad.",44642,3
44643,I am about the model's dress size and just over 5'6- this dress was still well over 8 inches too long.,44643,3
44643,"Unless your over 6+ foot tall, plan to get this dress altered because six inch heels still couldn't help me.",44643,3
44644,This hat is very large to be classified as an infant hat.,44644,3
44644,"If it wasn't for the fact that it fits my two year old toddler and is good quality, I would have rated it a 2.",44644,3
44646,These workout leggings aren't extremely flattering on me.,44646,3
44646,"I work out on a semi-regular basis and consider my legs to be one of my greater assets, but my body type is somewhat curvy and the waistband sits really funny on me.",44646,3
44646,"My favorite leggings / yoga pants are the ones that have great tummy control so you're not having wardrobe malfunctions while you're at the gym, but these fall short in that category.",44646,3
44646,"I appreciate the pockets, but I'm constantly pulling them back up over my waist to smooth the ""love handle"" bump they create.",44646,3
44646,"I ultimately decided not to return them because I like having a backup pair in my arsenal in the event my favorites are in the wash, but that's all these are to me.",44646,3
44646,"The colors and striping look kind of cute on the model, but I feel like it looks awkward and a little too sporty on me.",44646,3
44646,Those with an athletic body type might find that the waistband on these is perfect.,44646,3
44647,Order larger if you like something that's not skin tight.,44647,3
44647,Also please realize this is racerback.,44647,3
44647,I did not read the title I guess and I thought it was a little more full back.,44647,3
44648,I don't know if it was because I was using the case in an already lit up room.,44648,3
44648,However very flashy and got a lot of compliments !,44648,3
44649,Bought it for my 10 year old daughter and its too big,44649,3
44650,Blue is bright not light.,44650,3
44652,This is a sturdy and attractive chain.,44652,3
44652,"Unfortunately, an unforeseen problem of ever so slightly clanking metal developed.",44652,3
44652,This was a deal breaker for me.,44652,3
44653,I like these ankle stockings.,44653,3
44653,"They are silky and smooth but the knit is not as sheer as I would like for them to be, but they work just fine",44653,3
44654,VERY SMALL FOR A MANS HANDS,44654,3
44655,I was looking for a yellow necklaces that would compliment my black and white striped dress.,44655,3
44655,"When I receive this necklace, I wasn't expecting it to be so big.",44655,3
44655,If you want to wear a necklace that makes a statement this is the one.,44655,3
44655,Also the yellow is a little too bright for me.,44655,3
44655,The yellow is more of a slight neon/bright yellow.,44655,3
44655,I was looking more calmer/smoother yellow.,44655,3
44655,It's still a very nice piece of jewelry just not for me.,44655,3
44656,"Very cute, seems to be decently well made, but runs at least 1/2 size large.",44656,3
44657,"Soft stretchy material, slightly different color.",44657,3
44657,This shirt can really only be used as a nightgown.,44657,3
44658,It took really long to receive this!,44658,3
44658,They are a little small but will work.,44658,3
44659,Was good quality for the price but extremely small.,44659,3
44659,I ordered the largest size and it still wouldn't fit over my shoulders.,44659,3
44659,"I did, however, give to a friend and she liked it a lot.",44659,3
44660,I wear a size 6.,44660,3
44660,I ordered an extra large based upon prior reviews.,44660,3
44660,"The top fits okay, but the bottoms fit my 11 year old granddaughter.",44660,3
44660,"The item is cute, but it runs really, really small.",44660,3
44661,Sizing is crazy wrong!!,44661,3
44662,"Beautiful dress, however did not fit the need and look we expected.",44662,3
44663,Looks good but the material quality seems just OK,44663,3
44666,Very small for size that was ordered,44666,3
44667,One size didn't fit me and I'm within the size range at 5'7 155lbs.,44667,3
44667,Normally wear a size 8 pants.,44667,3
44667,I had to pull these on like tights and the thin elastic waist will create a muffin top on just about anyone.,44667,3
44667,They are also see through on the rear.,44667,3
44667,If you have pets these do seem to attract every fur.,44667,3
44667,The fabric is incredibly soft and slimming.,44667,3
44667,It doesn't show any bumps or lumps in the legs or rear.,44667,3
44667,I could deal with the slightly see through rear and wear long shirts.,44667,3
44667,It the waistband is too tight.,44667,3
44667,I might try the plus size leggings.,44667,3
44668,I liked it alot.,44668,3
44669,"Hat is nice, a little out of shape from mailing but really nice quality.",44669,3
44670,I purchased this dress for my wife as a gift.,44670,3
44670,The sizing was smaller than expected.,44670,3
44670,She typically wears a 12 and has several other Homeyee dresses in that size.,44670,3
44670,But this dress was too tight.,44670,3
44670,It has a low cut in the front and shows her cleavage.,44670,3
44670,"She thought it looked good, but it was too much for me.",44670,3
44670,Every man in the room would be checking out my wife.,44670,3
44670,I convinced her it had to be returned.,44670,3
44670,I'll get her another dress style instead.,44670,3
44671,These are okay I guess but did not look good at all with boots.,44671,3
44671,Very chunky and big.,44671,3
44671,I wouldn't buy them again.,44671,3
44672,Not ideal for someone that had a baby.,44672,3
44672,I don't wear mine.,44672,3
44672,I would order two sizes larger then needed.,44672,3
44673,"It looks great, but its super scratchy.",44673,3
44674,Looks cute BUT it doesn't stick too well...,44674,3
44674,I've had to go over it a few times to try to get some pieces to stay stuck.... Not sure if I'll keep it up :/,44674,3
44675,not for use in cold weather.,44675,3
44676,The apricot is not such a blush color that my computer monitor shows.,44676,3
44676,It is the color of a pastel brown paper bag color.,44676,3
44676,It's not even what I would consider apricot.,44676,3
44676,Other than that it is as described and I could use if the color were different.,44676,3
44677,"I didn't expect anything too high in quality, and so I wasn't disappointed when the product arrived and it was cheap-looking, but still beautiful (if you don't look at the frayed ""lace"" too closely).",44677,3
44677,"I bought it for a breastfeeding photo shoot where I will be a little out of focus, I would not wear this in public or around people who take me seriously.",44677,3
44678,"Runs small, tight fabric",44678,3
44679,"Good quality, but received a large and it was definitely too big.",44679,3
44680,"Ordered a size 8, ordered a medium.",44680,3
44680,This is shorter than as pictured and suns small.,44680,3
44681,"very comfy fabric, but the mesh near the MOST IMPORTANT PARTS is somehow abrasive since they add some side fabric with their patented design - I have another pair from 2 years ago and that fabric seems much softer?",44681,3
44681,unsure why they would do this to me... :( also this pair definitely rides up.,44681,3
44681,unsure if this is a solvable problem or an impossible standard though.,44681,3
44682,Didn't fit my ear but looked cute.,44682,3
44683,I was hoping these insoles would help with my plantar fasciitis and lessen my foot pains.,44683,3
44683,"However, I developed hip pains the first day wearing these and walking for about an hour.",44683,3
44683,My hip pains went away a couple of days after I stopped using these.,44683,3
44683,I am afraid to wear these again.,44683,3
44684,Could have some more stick to it.,44684,3
44684,I worry about if i wear this and it falls of from me sweating.,44684,3
44684,Will have to do a test run.,44684,3
44685,I bought this for my friend for his birthday and it was really small but he loved them and still wore them anyway,44685,3
44686,My Son Loves it..,44686,3
44686,The only Thing is that some of the Buttons have fallen off...while he was at school and he was disappointed...,44686,3
44686,I have had to re-attach them.,44686,3
44686,And I secured them all.... Just incase...,44686,3
44687,It was much too large for my daughter who is a size 4.,44687,3
44687,We had to order another dress.,44687,3
44687,There weren't any defects as far as I could see but be wary when you buy this dress.,44687,3
44688,"a bit long (I'm 5'1"") I can wear with higher heels.",44688,3
44688,"They are fairly comfortable, but a bit cheap feeling.",44688,3
44688,"Look fine, don't know how well they will hold up.",44688,3
44691,I give 3 stars because they are totally see-thru!,44691,3
44691,You must wear a long shirt or dress over the butt.,44691,3
44691,"Other than the see-thru issue they are very cute and comfy, they are more shimmery than I imagined them to be, but not crazily so.",44691,3
44691,Overall I do like these.,44691,3
44691,"My belly measures 49"" and these do not seem to dig into my fat in any kind of unusual way.",44691,3
44691,"I have not worn them for any length of time yet, I only tried them on.",44691,3
44692,Afraid ill get made fun of at the beach.,44692,3
44692,The poka dots are obnoxious.,44692,3
44692,Decided to wear it as a minnie mouse cosplay costume for Halloween.,44692,3
44693,The style is cute but sadly it is way to short for my torso.,44693,3
44693,"I am 5'10"" and it just doesn't fit on my torso, plus there is no give in the material.",44693,3
44693,The leg holes are also kind of tight for the same reason - no give in the fabric.,44693,3
44693,I am disappointed because it looked so cute online!,44693,3
44694,I'm not quite sure what I'm bothered about this top but it just didn't look good on me.,44694,3
44694,I felt like I was wearing a maternity top but that's probably because I'm so used to wearing very fitted clothes even when it's a casual top.,44694,3
44694,This particular design is tight all over except for the puffy bottom.,44694,3
44694,I don't even know how to explain it but I supposed the gathers at the hem is adding illusion of puffiness.,44694,3
44695,"Reviews indicated that this was good for shorter torsos, but really it was too short for me and I'm 5'2"".",44695,3
44695,Returned it and bought a longer type that would cover the whole way to my section cut.,44695,3
44696,These tanks are adorable which is the only reason they're getting 3 stars.,44696,3
44696,"I'm 5""8 and  bought these for workouts, but they're too short to workout out in without constantly riding up.",44696,3
44696,They're also incredibly undersized and really snug.,44696,3
44696,"They'll be good for lounging around the house/working from home/PJ-wear, but definitely too form fitting and too short for me to exercise in until I lose more weight.",44696,3
44699,I should have gotten the next size up.,44699,3
44699,I go a 3 and should have gotten a 4.,44699,3
44699,This shirt runs small.,44699,3
44699,Other then that it was great.,44699,3
44700,The material is okay!,44700,3
44701,"Get a size larger, bit this shirt dress is worth the price.",44701,3
44702,"Very cute and well-made, but way too big for newborn size.",44702,3
44702,Ended up returning the item.,44702,3
44703,got a hole in one arm pit,44703,3
44704,Pretty and comfortable but runs small,44704,3
44705,Not a huge fan of the top part of this nursing shirt- it's not super supportive and feels cheap.,44705,3
44706,Love the color and the material!,44706,3
44706,Love the basic design.,44706,3
44706,It also arrived when the company said that it would.,44706,3
44706,"However, upon arrival I debated whether or not to keep it.",44706,3
44706,"After reading the title I realize that the word ""tote"" describes the look or style of the bag and not its function.",44706,3
44706,I have been carrying it around for a couple of days.,44706,3
44706,I wish that it was larger.,44706,3
44706,I use a wallet and placed it in the zippered section of the bag for security.,44706,3
44706,"The sides of the bag collapse inward, making the sides of the bag shorter.",44706,3
44706,It is not a tote bag in which one can carry a lot of stuff.,44706,3
44706,"This is a large purse and a medium sized tote that will carry flat items like a tablet, thin wallet and minimal make-up.",44706,3
44706,"It is very cute, but not what I was looking for or expected.",44706,3
44707,Product came all wrinkled.,44707,3
44707,It's OK for the price,44707,3
44709,It didn't look formal or elegant enough.,44709,3
44709,"They sides or ""low"" part of the dress didn't look like the picture.",44709,3
44711,"This is a pretty ring, well made and a beautiful setting, however the ring I received was not sparkly at all, the stones were gray and flat.",44711,3
44711,"I realize it's an inexpensive cz ring, just was hoping for a little more sparkle.",44711,3
44712,too small; didn't fit; liked it otherwise,44712,3
44713,Really cute but I returned it.,44713,3
44713,Wasn't right for the event,44713,3
44714,It's shorter than it looks on the model.,44714,3
44714,I would have loved it if it was longer.,44714,3
44714,And material is thin and see through.,44714,3
44715,I love the colors of these onesies..,44715,3
44715,"However, one of the three onesies I've ordered is defective (one sleeve is .5"" shorter than the other), i'm exchanging it.",44715,3
44715,"Also, the three onesies differ in width: the widest is 2"" wider (circumference) than the narrowest.",44715,3
44715,All are marked the same size.,44715,3
44715,"Finally, fabric is on a thin side.",44715,3
44716,I bought for my Rosie costume.,44716,3
44716,It was OK. Like some others I had a hard time getting it to look right without the ugly underside showing.,44716,3
44716,Part of my hair was still wet and the red bled really bad.,44716,3
44716,It was good enough for one wearing.,44716,3
44717,I even ordered the largest size.,44717,3
44717,I'm not super skinny.,44717,3
44717,But i'm not huge.,44717,3
44717,Size was a little tight.,44717,3
44717,Otherwise great looking shirt for just running out for one night.,44717,3
44718,It was pretty but the size was VERY small.,44718,3
44718,I had to return it,44718,3
44719,It's a bit hard to get the hair band on and off the bracelet easily and even more difficult for a kid.,44719,3
44719,"The bracelet did stay on after I took the band off and put it in my hair, but certainly not something I'd want to go back and forth with as it's hard to get on and off the bracelet quickly.",44719,3
44720,"I bought these for my wife who is 5'0"" tall and around 107 lbs.",44720,3
44720,"Unfortunately, the smallest size were still loose on her (length-wise).",44720,3
44720,"The pattern is cool, although pixelated like a zoomed-in, low-res image would be.",44720,3
44720,"it's okay, just okay.",44720,3
44721,These shoes look really great.,44721,3
44721,The problems with lack of support arose when I exercised.,44721,3
44721,It feels like there is little to no support in them.,44721,3
44721,Possibly this is a shoe more geared for an office environment or short walking distances.,44721,3
44722,Decal is alittle low but overall not bad,44722,3
44723,"The material of this is very strange, almost like an under armor shirt.",44723,3
44723,Not what I expected for a cardigan.,44723,3
44723,The sleeves are also very long and flare out at the wrists.,44723,3
44723,I do still like this cardigan overall though and will keep and wear it.,44723,3
44723,I ordered the same size as I usually wear and it fit very well.,44723,3
44724,The body fit well but the arms were a bit too snug for my likening.,44724,3
44724,I cut them off since its summer and sewed the edges.,44724,3
44725,"I like the dress, but it is way too short.",44725,3
44725,Made for someone that is 4 feet tall not 5'6.,44725,3
44725,Comes just below the knees.,44725,3
44725,"I do not show my legs, they are damaged better to keep them covered.",44725,3
44726,"Cute and worked for the holiday, but the arms were short, more like 3/4 length sleeves and the coloring on the pant stripes was more orange than red.",44726,3
44726,They were cute to wear for one or two times,44726,3
44727,For a sweatshirt very thin material.,44727,3
44728,"They did the job but I had to keep an eye on one, it would straighten out and come off.",44728,3
44728,wore them for only 2 hours and the one is missing.,44728,3
44728,Maybe it fell out on the helicopter.,44728,3
44729,It's okay for the money.,44729,3
44730,"The waist size (34"") was fine but the rise is very short.",44730,3
44730,"If you likeb rief briefs, this will work for you.",44730,3
44730,"Otherwise, there are mesh briefs available from other sources, but at MUCH higher prices.",44730,3
44731,Was a little small based on the size chart.,44731,3
44731,We made it work with minor alterations,44731,3
44732,"In response to your email regarding the fact that two of these socks (one from each of two pairs) keep riding down off the back of my heels, I wear a 7 1/2 size shoe.",44732,3
44733,Much smaller than I expected,44733,3
44734,"Very pretty, but the flares are too dramatic; couldn't get them in and I've been this size for over 10 years :(",44734,3
44735,Bottoms fit perfect but the top didn't fit well.,44735,3
44736,One of them broke within the first day,44736,3
44737,"It's pretty, but it broke within the first 2 days",44737,3
44739,Looks good & fit well,44739,3
44742,"way to small for long legs, barely comes up above the knee.",44742,3
44742,rolls down at the top.,44742,3
44742,"nice material, warm, but too small for me.",44742,3
44743,"I think it was gorgeous, and the quality was nice.",44743,3
44743,"But the size was kind of small, that's all.",44743,3
44744,The size is larger than described.,44744,3
44746,Some out of that pack was small,44746,3
44747,"Good price, very fast shipping.",44747,3
44747,Designs are off center... looks odd.,44747,3
44748,I misread the descriptions and thought this was larger than it was.,44748,3
44748,Not sure why any necklace description shows the box dimensions above the actual pendant dimension...,44748,3
44748,"It  was of okay quality and is nice enough for the price,but there are better options out there.",44748,3
44750,I received my socks and everything is as expected.,44750,3
44750,Can't wait to practice in them.,44750,3
44750,I would order from this seller again!,44750,3
44751,The bag is beautiful but it's not large like its portrayed to be.,44751,3
44751,Just a size bigger than a mini bag...,44751,3
44752,"Lining in lighter pocket tore within a very short time, had to dab a little contact adhesive between lining and leather to hold it in place and stop it bunching and snagging lighter.",44752,3
44752,"Purchased one black one brown, black one used most and has no centre seam down front lighter or rear coin pockets.",44752,3
44752,Brown one has (pointless) decorative centre seam (as usually illustrated) front and rear.,44752,3
44752,Front seam stitching has no reinforcing at lighter pocket opening.,44752,3
44752,Looks likely to give trouble sooner rather than later.,44752,3
44752,Leather is good and solid.,44752,3
44752,Size is spot on for regular (84mm) packs of 20 (after a little use).,44752,3
44752,"O.k., But not the ""premium product"" I used to associate with the Buxton name many years ago.",44752,3
44753,The neck opening of this scrub top is a bit too small.,44753,3
44753,I just have difficulty putting it on without messing up my hair in the process.,44753,3
44754,Im an XL and ordered XL but after washing it was a L,44754,3
44755,Really nicely organized with perfectly sized pockets for common purse things.,44755,3
44755,The problem is this bag will significantly wear within a year -- it will last longer than a year but it will look pretty beat up.,44755,3
44756,Quality is what you can expect from the price,44756,3
44757,I do like it a lot.,44757,3
44757,Been on two trips already.,44757,3
44757,"I say it fits small, more so because of the length.",44757,3
44757,It may only come halfway down my butt.,44757,3
44757,And the idea is to cover up.,44757,3
44757,"If it were a little longer, and there was a sleeveless version, I'd have multiples in different colors!",44757,3
44759,"Fits small on the Torso, but it's good material",44759,3
44760,I liked the detail and color was nicer than depicted.,44760,3
44760,"However, it came out of the packaging with a terrible stench.",44760,3
44760,As though it had been wet and stored for over a year.,44760,3
44761,"This fits somewhat small, or at least for my head it did.",44761,3
44761,Expect to have some breaking in period to stretch the fabric out.,44761,3
44761,"The black portions, especially the pom, came faded when delivered.",44761,3
44763,It doesn't look much like the picture.,44763,3
44763,It's not made very well.,44763,3
44764,"The color is beautiful and the bag roomy, but this is a very soft bag.",44764,3
44764,"Depending on what you carry in it, it can be lumpy.",44764,3
44766,I am a little disappointed with the top of these.,44766,3
44766,"The top is very loose but, they look like the picture.",44766,3
44767,I really liked the dress but the size I ordered was wrong and the dress was to tight.,44767,3
44768,A very odd fit.,44768,3
44768,"And although the bust is very pretty, the halter strips are flimsy and made of a very cheap ribbon.",44768,3
44768,It started fraying almost immediately.,44768,3
44768,Also the lace up in the back is the equivalent of a shoe string.,44768,3
44769,Very nice but a little tight on the back,44769,3
44770,"I am 5'5"" and 135lbs, fit, got this dress in a medium because of the sizing for the bust and hips, wish I would of gotten a small for fit since it isn't cut exactly like the photo (which has a taper in the waist) no waist taper on the actual dress.",44770,3
44770,"however it is so short I cannot wear it without a pair of shorts underneath it for safety, (im big in the hip and this dress goes right up) also the stitching on it isn't great, a lot of the liner was sticking out on the edges of the straps and dips front and back, I used some nude color thread and stitched the edges down to wear you cant see them.",44770,3
44770,Very pretty dress otherwise and a good buy to use for a night out.,44770,3
44770,make sure to wear short shorts under it or even leggings when you wear this if you have hips.,44770,3
44771,collar on my shirt ripped the second time i  wore it.,44771,3
44771,but it fit very nice love the shirt other than that.,44771,3
44772,"That was the largest size avalialble - XL but its really tight n much smaller as XL should be
The rest is fine",44772,3
44773,I got this for my grand daughter.,44773,3
44773,It's perfect for a child.,44773,3
44774,nice dress but the quality isn't the best.,44774,3
44774,One of the straps already ripped.,44774,3
44774,Have to get it fixed.,44774,3
44774,Overall its a good fit .,44774,3
44775,The fabric is very soft.,44775,3
44775,"The length is just below hips (5'4"").",44775,3
44775,The color and pattern are flattering.,44775,3
44775,Sleeves stay up when pushed up.,44775,3
44776,The fit of the garment was fine however the material easily snags.,44776,3
44777,There is a hole in the shoulder seam :(,44777,3
44780,These slip off a lot.,44780,3
44780,I wear a 9 1/2 so maybe I just needed a larger size.,44780,3
44782,I thought I had ordered a cleaner to go with the brush.,44782,3
44782,So I have a brush and the purse will stay in the closet until I get the cleaner for it.,44782,3
44782,Just another one of my stupid mistakes.,44782,3
44783,"My nephew, 5yo, of course, LOVED the design.",44783,3
44783,"However I purposely purchased the size ""6 years old"" thinking he would have a bit of room to grow, as he is on the slight size.",44783,3
44783,(These are for sleep overs at my house.),44783,3
44783,"Instead, the shirt is a perfect fit and the shorts fit in the waist but appear tight from there down.",44783,3
44783,"If they shrink in the wash, we're in trouble;  likewise if he has a growth spurt.",44783,3
44783,"I should have gotten a size ""7 years old"" or ""8 years old""...or perhaps they should use normal sizing charts like everyone else.",44783,3
44783,But HE is happy and that is what matters most!!!,44783,3
44784,Beautiful shirt but the flower didn't last too long it came off right away but my daughter really loves this shirt,44784,3
44785,These are much smaller then the ones I ordered before from the same seller  ...Still pretty... but I lost one from previous order and I really liked the size,44785,3
44787,The bust was really way too small for the bottom.,44787,3
44787,"I am a 38D and ordered a 5x, the bottom fit perfectly and is beautiful.",44787,3
44787,the top barely covers my bust and i had to squeeze them in.,44787,3
44787,The padding is oversized for the material.,44787,3
44787,After i cut the padding out the top fit and looked better.,44787,3
44787,Full figured girls with small boobs will look great in them if you order two size larger.,44787,3
44787,I am a size 16 and ordered a 5XL andd the top was still small.,44787,3
44788,The collar was out of sorts.,44788,3
44788,The shirt was as I expected.,44788,3
44789,"Runs small, especially if you're a little curvy.",44789,3
44789,The material is not stretchy at all so it's hard to take on/off to use the restroom.,44789,3
44789,"Also, the material wrinkles super easily.",44789,3
44789,"It's cute for the price, though -- just not the most comfortable or convenient to wear.",44789,3
44790,It's acceptable for the price.,44790,3
44791,First thing we noticed upon opening the package is the smell.,44791,3
44791,It does smell weird (fishy like my son's hermit crab food).,44791,3
44791,"The dress looked nice, the ruffles on the front falls/drapes as pictured.",44791,3
44791,But the ruffles at the back are not evenly sewn.,44791,3
44791,"If you inspect it closely, you'll notice more imperfection with the stitching.",44791,3
44791,This won't matter if you are using this for a night time affair.,44791,3
44791,"However, the scary part if that there are ""hand sewn?""",44791,3
44791,stitches reinforcing the lacing loops.,44791,3
44791,We are unsure if it (chiffon lace and loops) will be able to last the upcoming event.,44791,3
44791,The dress is bigger than expected.,44791,3
44791,"We tried lacing it up tightly, but still loose on the bodice bra part.",44791,3
44791,We decided to return it.,44791,3
44792,"While it is a cute swimsuit, it is cut 2 sizes or more too small and I do not think it will hold up very well.",44792,3
44792,Had to send back.,44792,3
44793,"Good quality, I feel very classy in it.",44793,3
44793,"However, I am only 5'2""  and this barely covers my bottom so beware - it's short!",44793,3
44794,"I like this sports bra and wear it often, however I don't recommend it to anyone with boobs larger than a B cup.",44794,3
44794,"It's not very padded at all, however it is tight enough to hold my boobs in place.",44794,3
44794,"Only downside, it rides up and digs into my armpits.",44794,3
44795,The ball that it came with would not screw on!,44795,3
44795,Thank goodness I had another one from a different belly ring.,44795,3
44795,Otherwise it was what I expected.,44795,3
44796,I just ordered this for the skirt.,44796,3
44796,"It's very small, so it fits high up on the waist.",44796,3
44796,The top is polyester and pure crap.,44796,3
44796,You might as well throw it out.,44796,3
44797,Fits smaller than a true size large.,44797,3
44797,Will buy a size bigger next time.,44797,3
44798,"Too loose.. air hits my neck from top, it should be a skin tight fit.",44798,3
44798,I need a tighter fit,44798,3
44799,Came with the part that goes in the hole bent like it was squished .,44799,3
44799,The only thing protecting it was a sponge and plastic bag.,44799,3
44799,Hope they find a better way .,44799,3
44799,Looks awesome had to bend back the oart that was messed up shown in the first picture and carefully bent the top since it squished my ear .,44799,3
44799,It's a bit small .,44799,3
44799,Also theres a little plastic on top of the metal head shapped part and it looks like its suppose to be allinged together but thw plastic is glued on a little off .,44799,3
44799,Im a perfectionist .,44799,3
44799,....but It still looks gorgeous.,44799,3
44800,they ripped the first time I put them onn.,44800,3
44800,a bit too thin for me,44800,3
44801,Good for skinny legs... Will use them as socks...,44801,3
44802,Its a very cute top for get up n go with a pair of jeans on..but i thinks the large (i purchased) is too long.,44802,3
44802,I plan on ordering a m&eacute;dium next time.,44802,3
44802,Still love it..hopefully is shrinks after a few washes.,44802,3
44803,"I really wanted to like this coat, and based on the reviews, I really thought I would.",44803,3
44803,"It could be that I just have sensitive skin, but when I tried this on, I felt that the coat was quite scratchy and itchy.",44803,3
44803,"It did not feel soft, but it was warm and if worn over a long-sleeve shirt or sweater, it probably would work well.",44803,3
44803,"Unfortunately, I had to return it.",44803,3
44804,It came early which was a plus.,44804,3
44804,I love the way the top fit although as other ladies mentioned it was not as bright as pictured.,44804,3
44804,The bottom was very tight and I ordered a 4X.,44804,3
44805,The dress is gorgeous but made for a very short/petite person.,44805,3
44805,Barely covered the bits in the back of you know what I mean.....I'm 5'2.,44805,3
44805,Don't usually have that problem at all...,44805,3
44806,This dress was really pretty.,44806,3
44806,I loved the deep plunge and how it made my boobs look.,44806,3
44806,But unfortunately it wasn't comfortable at all because of all the sequins.,44806,3
44806,So this dress isn't for you if you value comfort like I do.,44806,3
44807,wayyyyyy too short for a maxi dress.,44807,3
44807,I'm 5'3 and it hits about mid shin.,44807,3
44808,Ordered 0-3 months would fit a six month old.,44808,3
44808,"My daughter is over 8 lbs, one month two weeks and it swallowed her.",44808,3
44808,Have to buy another onsie and trim the tutu to make it work.,44808,3
44808,Also the leg warmers were way too long.,44808,3
44810,I have a top like this and this one is the same size but fits too small,44810,3
44811,They get lost along with the mitten.,44811,3
44812,My husband loves his ring!,44812,3
44812,In fact the only reason i only gave it 3 stars is because the black does easily scratch!,44812,3
44812,If your husband is someone that works a lot with his hands hen get the silver one version of this ring.,44812,3
44812,Cause the black does scratch!,44812,3
44812,Other then that it's awesome!,44812,3
44813,Thought they were thicker but still good,44813,3
44814,Bought 2 of these for my wife.,44814,3
44814,"They were folded when I bought them, so they are kind of bent.",44814,3
44814,"Leather is thin, but they are pretty and my wife likes them.",44814,3
44815,You get what you pay for,44815,3
44816,Sizes run smaller than regular US sizes,44816,3
44817,"IT's ok, bulky, but functional !",44817,3
44817,It serves its purpose.,44817,3
44818,These pants look nice but you get what you pay for.,44818,3
44818,They're cute and super comfortable.,44818,3
44818,I wish they were better quality.,44818,3
44819,"comfortable, but ran too small for me...",44819,3
44820,I thought the material would be more comfortable and for beach use.,44820,3
44821,"I am happy with the quality of the wallet, and with how slim it is, but it's still way too big to fit well in the front pocket of clothing cut for a woman - I wonder if rounding the edges (and making the whole wallet much smaller; ie., just barely bigger than an ID or other card) would help with that.",44821,3
44821,"I would still recommend this wallet to others, especially if they didn't need to keep it in a front pocket.",44821,3
44821,Thank you for reading!,44821,3
44822,Cute but too big at the top.,44822,3
44823,Stretched more than I thought... unless I lost weight within the week :),44823,3
44824,My 7 month old has eczema and scratches his body a lot.,44824,3
44824,These mittens are helpful but he's still able to pull them off rather easily.,44824,3
44825,"Didn't hate it, didn't love it.",44825,3
44825,"It served it's purpose but isn't a ""wow"" cover up....",44825,3
44826,"It did what it was supposed to do, but barely!",44826,3
44826,I had a Buttoneer years ago and it was much better made.,44826,3
44826,The plastic pieces are really cheesy too!,44826,3
44827,these work as your basic sunglasses.,44827,3
44827,Aren't the most comfy & aren't very dark.,44827,3
44828,"However, the color shows light pink & green.",44828,3
44828,The actual color was dark red & dark green.,44828,3
44828,But it's still cute.,44828,3
44829,"I loved this bathing suit when I saw it online, the top fits perfectly, I am a petite girl, and I'm 5'6'', I got a medium and it fit great, my only complain was that the bottom fits awkwardly, almost like it is make of a squishy cardboard.",44829,3
44829,I paired it with bottoms I already owned and liked those better.,44829,3
44830,For the price they were I would not complain.,44830,3
44830,I like the feel of the tops and the soles are just what I was looking for.,44830,3
44831,"as expected - as advertised

get what you pay for - cheap jewelry",44831,3
44832,size is not american but wife likes it so don't have to send back,44832,3
44833,Cute but hem does not match up :(,44833,3
44834,The design is cool but warning: the cotton material and string-back provide very little support.,44834,3
44835,The package arrive fast about 2 week coming from across the ocean pretty fast.,44835,3
44835,This necklace its nice.,44835,3
44835,looks beautiful with alot of my looks and outfits.,44835,3
44835,the only thing is that you only can wear it  just acouple of times because after a few uses it will turn dark and black.,44835,3
44836,"My husband had lost so much weight that I had to start to get him boys clothes, so these may actually be ok fit wise.",44836,3
44837,Was small in the just.,44837,3
44840,"I definitely can't wear this without a black tank top underneath because my chest would be almost fully exposed, which is annoying.",44840,3
44840,"The dress is cute though, so I wear it with a tank top.",44840,3
44842,Kinda different fit than I would have wanted,44842,3
44844,Not as pretty in hand.,44844,3
44844,"I have the black one also, which I would say looks alot nicer.",44844,3
44845,Looks lovely on me,44845,3
44846,Ok  but I don't know if it's worth the price,44846,3
44847,"Small, and stiff cotton.",44847,3
44848,It's alright but it's definitely not as cute as the photo.,44848,3
44848,Has a high neckline and smaller shoulder cuts,44848,3
44850,"Very elegantly styled, well worth the price.",44850,3
44850,The only draw back is that necklace was too short.,44850,3
44850,I will have to get an extension in order to wear it.,44850,3
44851,Purse is nice but leather is kind of hard.,44851,3
44851,thought it would be softer,44851,3
44852,"Not quite as attractive as shown on my computer, but worth every penny of the (very low) amount it cost (LOL).",44852,3
44852,"Picture is somewhat faded and the ""Le Petit Prince"" on the top can just barely be seen.",44852,3
44852,"I wouldn't wear it as jewelry, but as a zipper pull on my purse, it will be fine.",44852,3
44853,Got what I paid for,44853,3
44854,Runs a little small on the chest,44854,3
44855,A little too big,44855,3
44856,"I like these workout pants, but ran a little bit smaller than I imagined.",44856,3
44859,Don't look like the picture on you,44859,3
44860,It was way too small and I bought 2 sizes too big and it was still too small.,44860,3
44860,"However, they did process the return quickly so I will give it a 3 :star because of the customer aervice",44860,3
44861,"I do like them , but it's a tight fit, I'm 4'11 , 110 pounds.",44861,3
44861,Lying on my sofa using my iPad is very difficult.,44861,3
44861,Small too small and I have to fold the sleeves up one whole cuff.,44861,3
44861,Medium would be tooooo long leg wise and double arm wise.,44861,3
44861,"Just put them on and go to bed and keep your arms down, disappointed for the amount of money",44861,3
44863,Fits great except the arms...way too big.,44863,3
44863,Wish I had ordered a size smaller.,44863,3
44864,"I typically wear a womens large (im 5'7"" , 155 lbs) but ordered a XXL because it was significantly cheaper...and all the reviews said the shirt runs small.",44864,3
44864,"An XL probably would have fit, but i didn't mind it being a little baggy.",44864,3
44865,"Its ok, cheap fabric and poor seams, I'll still wear it but I don't think the quality will last long.",44865,3
44866,"These headbands were a gift to my coaching team, but I hesitated before sending them because they smelled strange.",44866,3
44866,It was like a cheap smell.,44866,3
44866,I just sprayed some downy on them.,44866,3
44866,They're super cute though!,44866,3
44867,Love it its too big but ok,44867,3
44868,Wrong size is all!,44868,3
44869,Hmmm...debating whether to return this.,44869,3
44869,"I do like the fit (slightly fitted - not too loose, not to tight) and color (got the rose violet, and I think it looks a bit nicer than pictured, not quite as bright pink).",44869,3
44869,BUT - it's not fleece at all!,44869,3
44869,"Just regular knit, pretty thin.",44869,3
44869,Not sure if they forgot the lining or what.,44869,3
44869,"Was looking for something medium weight with some warmth, and this is definitely lightweight.",44869,3
44869,"Could be a casual sub-in for a cardigan, but not so much for a real fleece hoodie.",44869,3
44871,Great price but too small,44871,3
44872,It could be cute on someone with the right frame but on me it was cut really weird.,44872,3
44872,I have a long torso and long legs so it was short and hit me weird in the midsection.,44872,3
44873,Definitely buy biggier if you plan to where outside.,44873,3
44873,Go for indoor only party,44873,3
44874,Doesn't stick that well.,44874,3
44875,I thought the earrings would be bigger in size.,44875,3
44875,They are pretty though.,44875,3
44877,a little girlish looking..,44877,3
44879,The quality of this item is poor.,44879,3
44879,The zipper is cheap and does not work well.,44879,3
44879,The fabric choice is bad.,44879,3
44879,The item for smaller than expected.,44879,3
44880,But it was flimsy and small for my 11 year old's head.,44880,3
44881,It wasn't as long as shown in the picture which is why I purchased it.,44881,3
44881,But I still like it,44881,3
44883,It has a funny smell.,44883,3
44883,It's cute but looks a little cheap.,44883,3
44884,I do not like the cut.,44884,3
44884,Too large in the middle and too tight around the bottom.,44884,3
44884,The sleeves were short also,44884,3
44885,"The torso part of this outfit runs short
 If you are a tall like me 5'9 and up, the shorts on this romper will be cheeky.",44885,3
44885,I used mine as a bikni cover up.,44885,3
44886,These look well made but they are not for us smaller busted girls.,44886,3
44886,I ordered a size small and they were huge.,44886,3
44886,I am a 34A pre-pregnancy and barely a 34B once I get nursing established.,44886,3
44886,"The padding is way too thick also, granted you can remove it but then there isn't enough shape to the bra.",44886,3
44887,It is more loose than I thought it would be.,44887,3
44887,The pants fall down a little when I'm stretching.,44887,3
44887,I thought it would be tighter.,44887,3
44887,I love the pattern.,44887,3
44887,They are super cute pants.,44887,3
44887,I was worried they would not fit as they looked small when they arrived but they stretched to cover me.,44887,3
44887,Now they are a little too loose.,44887,3
44887,Maybe the material stretches the more they are washed as I did wash it after they arrived.,44887,3
44887,They are fun to wear but they are a little see-through so I have to be careful with what I wear underneath.,44887,3
44888,"Was way too short right at my ankle I have not worn it I had to give it away , I will be purchasing  from another seller who has them longer
I am 5,4 in height",44888,3
44889,The clasp that attaches to the chain is nothing like the photo,44889,3
44890,Not really impressed with the fabric,44890,3
44891,I ordered size 7 and they looked really big when I opened them.,44891,3
44891,They are 7/8 size.,44891,3
44891,I decided to keep them since they are cute and my daughter will grow into them.,44891,3
44891,They are also very wide.,44891,3
44891,"Not a big deal overall, just much wider than I expected.",44891,3
44891,May be for kids with wider/fatter feet.,44891,3
44892,Overall it was okay.,44892,3
44892,My daughter is 5'5'' and a size M in general and the dress was too big and far too long (which hemming can fix of course).,44892,3
44892,"The materials were surprisingly nice for the price but because it fit strangely, the colors were a bit tacky (a more peachy color), and the style looked quite ""prom-ish"", she had to return it.",44892,3
44892,"Overall, the dress look wasn't too great.",44892,3
44892,But the dress came on time and in good condition.,44892,3
44892,She might buy from this seller again.,44892,3
44893,...and the little buckles that hold the sleeves up don't hold at  all - always slip loose.,44893,3
44893,"I love the color - the quality of the garment is ""meh"".",44893,3
44894,This sleeping cap does require a bit of breaking in.,44894,3
44894,You will need another if you sleep with rollers as this one isn't suitable for that.,44894,3
44894,Especially if you use long or thick rollers.,44894,3
44894,"For every day use, it's just fine.",44894,3
44895,"Cute, a piece of the leather strap broke within wearing is <10 times.",44895,3
44895,Would not recommend because of this.,44895,3
44895,But the style & size is super cute.,44895,3
44896,Arrived sooner then expected however runs small/tight.,44896,3
44896,I am a medium but ordered large and it fits snug instead of loose.,44896,3
44896,I'd pay 4/5$ for this nothing more.,44896,3
44897,"Cute top, but the blue dye leaked into the coral trim.",44897,3
44898,"Good for light daily use - going to school, walking to/from the car, etc.",44898,3
44898,I wouldn't recommend them for playing in the snow though.,44898,3
44898,Definitely not water proof or warm enough for long periods of outdoor play.,44898,3
44899,"I'm 5'9 and 138lb VS 34B and purchased the ""Medium"" based on other reviews.",44899,3
44899,The top fit great but the bottom is very low cut and I was hoping for more moderate rear coverage.,44899,3
44899,"For this price, I'm keeping the top and will pair with different bottoms.",44899,3
44899,Still waiting to see how it holds up after a few trips in the ocean....,44899,3
44900,The dress in itself is beautiful well made and looked exactly like pictured.,44900,3
44900,However the proportions were way off in the bust and waist.,44900,3
44900,"My daughter is 5'9, 138lb with a 36B bra but could not even make a ""hefty"" push up bra help fill in the upper portion of the dress, and the waist was a little ""tight"".",44900,3
44900,We had to return the dress :-(,44900,3
44901,Quality is not that great.. Don't remember how much I paid for it but I wouldn't pay more than 99 cents,44901,3
44902,This is already turning colors.,44902,3
44902,I love this piece but I can't wear non rusty color necklace,44902,3
44903,The material is great and silky.,44903,3
44903,Should have gone 1 size down.,44903,3
44903,But it will work.,44903,3
44904,They do not fit true to size.,44904,3
44905,"Material is stretchy, order a size larger if you don't want it too fit too snug.",44905,3
44905,Material is super soft and hugs every curve of your body.,44905,3
44905,Also this is a shear material.,44905,3
44905,"The quality could be better, but its definitely good compared to cheap materials.",44905,3
44906,It runs really small.,44906,3
44908,Cute top but a little thin.,44908,3
44909,I love it but its too small im a size 18 and got the XXL and it was a size too small.,44909,3
44910,The front of the pin is beautiful.,44910,3
44910,"However, the back of the pin is super short, so you can only pin it to thin materials.",44910,3
44910,"I wanted to pin this on my coat, but, although I can technically get it to fit, it would come right off.",44910,3
44910,Also the back of the pin isn't that snug so it can easily fall off.,44910,3
44910,I worry about this pin just falling off while I'm out and about.,44910,3
44910,The sharp end is also slightly bent.,44910,3
44910,"I'd only get this if you plan on wearing it with thin materials (normal shirts are ok- just no coats, purses, maybe sweaters depending on the thickness).",44910,3
44910,"It does look very nice, though.",44910,3
44911,"While it looks more expensive from afar, it pretty much seems like a cheap watch when you put it on.",44911,3
44911,"It's lightweight and unsubstantial, and the buttons don't feel solid.",44911,3
44911,"Given it's price, though, it's a good watch to wear during activities when you know it might get beat up.",44911,3
44912,It runs pretty small.,44912,3
44912,I was hoping it would more blousy.,44912,3
44913,"Looks nice, was delivered without being crushed but is way too big for me.",44913,3
44913,It will still look weird if I put a band inside to fill the gap.,44913,3
44913,I'd say It is not good for people with small to medium head size.,44913,3
44914,Shirt pilled horribly after 4th wash!,44914,3
44914,This is a super cute set except for the polling issue for the shirt.,44914,3
44914,The shorts and pants have held up well but it's not worth $36.00.,44914,3
44915,Love the print but the top potion is a little small.,44915,3
44915,Makes me feel like my boobs are popping out!,44915,3
44915,But it is very comfortable for a summer day/night.,44915,3
44916,The wrinkles won't come out.,44916,3
44917,Christmas gift; the receiver loved it!,44917,3
44917,"Only complaint is to watch those buttons -- they don't seem to be attached too well and the coat didn't come with spare one, just in case.",44917,3
44917,"Other than that, it's very cute!",44917,3
44918,"I love the design and look of this jacket...however I'm a 5'2, 120 pound women who usually wears a small/medium and I read the reviews and (I thought) an XL would do the trick....not so.",44918,3
44918,I had to return it and get the XXL.,44918,3
44918,"It fits, but the arms are a little short.",44918,3
44918,It's an adorable coat and I have been getting compliments every time I wear it.,44918,3
44918,I also love that it is fully lined.,44918,3
44918,"The only other complaint I have is there are no pockets, I do love pockets!",44918,3
44918,"But you know, you get what you pay for, and despite all the other issues I have I would recommend it...but only if you are a S/M.",44918,3
44918,"Unfortunately I don't think the XXL (which I now have) would fit anyone much larger...and if you have a larger bust line, forget about it.",44918,3
44919,nice party summer wear.,44919,3
44920,"The elastic in the straps is too soft/stretchy to really provide any ""lift"".",44920,3
44920,"The band was super awesome and supportive but the shoulder straps really ""let me down"".",44920,3
44920,Also the back is shorter then the front and since im tall it left an inch of back exposed.,44920,3
44920,I try to keep fit but those darn love handles just won't got away and are not the part i want exposed in my swim top.,44920,3
44920,The pattern was very pretty and the ruching was flattering.,44920,3
44920,If it had different straps i would have kept it but as is i had to send it back.,44920,3
44921,"I don't really like the way the waist is elastic-ed, but the pattern is nice.",44921,3
44922,The silk screen has already started cracking & peeling.,44922,3
44922,I've worn it 5 times & hung dried it every time.,44922,3
44924,Doesnt fit like the pic,44924,3
44925,I really liked this dress except i could not get it zipped in the back.,44925,3
44925,"I am 5'3 and 155 lbs, size C bra and the back was way too tight where I could not zip it all the way.",44925,3
44925,I usually wear a medium in dresses so after reading the reviews I ordered a large and it was still too small.,44925,3
44925,If I exchanged for an XL the front would be too low and open in the chest area.,44925,3
44926,I'm normally a medium and I ordered an extra large after reading the reviews.,44926,3
44926,I usually wear a 4-6 in pants and the skirt fits fine.,44926,3
44926,"I will have to take in the waist, I have it clipped in the back for the photo.",44926,3
44926,I like the top but had to but a bralette under in because it is too narrow and doesn't have enough coverage (I'm a 34b).,44926,3
44926,"Overall, just order two sizes up.",44926,3
44926,On a side note the fabric is not the most flattering if you're trying to cover up some trouble areas.,44926,3
44927,"While the ears and tie are really cute and do fit, I was disappointed in how short the tail was.",44927,3
44927,"I measured it to be about 8 1/2 inches long, about the size of a carrot.",44927,3
44927,"Might work ok for a small child, but way too short for an adult.",44927,3
44927,"I'm keeping it anyway for the head band and tie, but have ordered another leopard tail that is 23"" long.",44927,3
44928,Ordered a M and a L. Kept me he M returned the L.,44928,3
44929,"Nice fit, not so good finishing.",44929,3
44929,"Fit is as expected,  but, finishing is not, front pattern matches quite well on both legs nut rear pattern does not.",44929,3
44929,"If I were using this ONLY around the house or as underwear, no problem, but I use it also as gym wear.",44929,3
44929,My butt looks weird since pattern does not match.,44929,3
44930,"I read the previous reviews and was really looking forward to getting these capris, but despite following the size chart, they were much too small...",44930,3
44930,I couldn't even get them on.,44930,3
44930,"The material is nice and light weight, it seems well made.",44930,3
44930,Unfortunately I'm going to have to return mine.,44930,3
44931,fell apart with few holes within months,44931,3
44932,They were perfect for my 3 year olds fireman costume but I had a very difficult time opening the clips so sent them back.,44932,3
44933,Not elbow length sleeves...closer to a cap sleeve.,44933,3
44933,Ordered size 12 which is what I wear but would need a 16 in this.,44933,3
44933,Tag reads 3XL which is same size of another dress I ordered from same company....same brand....but this one is way to small and other one is WAYYYY to large.,44933,3
44933,Not cotton/linen....likely polyester or rayon.,44933,3
44933,I'd have found it a nice buy anyway if it had fit.,44933,3
44934,The top itself is cute as can be and the material is a super soft.,44934,3
44934,I ordered two sizes up like I always have to do with Hellbunny.,44934,3
44934,The problem was that the shirt is super stretchy with a spandex like fit.,44934,3
44934,"Being a plus size woman who gave birth to two kids and holds most of her weight in her stomach, it was not flattering AT ALL.",44934,3
44934,If it would have been just a t-shirt material and a little looser the fit would have been more flattering.,44934,3
44934,So if you carry weight in your stomach and are self-conscious about it I would reconsider buying this.,44934,3
44934,The three stars are more for the design than for anything else.,44934,3
44934,I was able to return it with no problems at all and received a full refund.,44934,3
44934,I just wish designers of plus size clothes would keep this in mind when designing clothes.,44934,3
44935,This has a very low waist and it ran small.,44935,3
44936,Like it just not big.,44936,3
44937,"Daughter lover the pattern but even with upsizing, with her athletic and muscular build it did not fix my swimmer.",44937,3
44937,It was longer then she expected but that is due to upside we think.,44937,3
44937,(Was past her knees),44937,3
44939,"sleeves are too long, waist area is too narrow.",44939,3
44940,It's alright but the fit is pretty weird.,44940,3
44940,The sleeves on it were way too short like the patches that were supposed to be on the elbows were on the back of my arms.,44940,3
44941,the dress was okay but although i took my size the upper part of the was too narrow it did not cover my busts.,44941,3
44942,The graphics are great and I love the vibrant colors!,44942,3
44944,I didn't like the material.,44944,3
44944,Also was too big.,44944,3
44944,I ordered a medium when I usually where medium to large.,44944,3
44944,Some make like it that large.,44944,3
44945,Cute  but kinda cheaply made,44945,3
44946,"cheap fabric ,but what do you except for $10.00 and washed it to see if the feel would feel better but it still felt like the touch of a sheer curtain.",44946,3
44947,The right shoe won't stay charged.,44947,3
44948,Doesnt hang on the nexk well.,44948,3
44948,A littler large than I expected.,44948,3
44949,Good quality just runs small,44949,3
44950,The quality of the plugs are really nice.,44950,3
44950,But the sizing is not correct the white plugs were way larger than the other two sets and the black set were same size but different lengths.,44950,3
44950,I still use them but wish they were more symmetrical,44950,3
44951,"I previously had a Bellroy ""Very Small Wallet"" which I used for 3 and a half years until the zipper broke and the wallet had been apparently discontinued.",44951,3
44951,"I replaced it with this, almost identical looking ""Card Pocket.""",44951,3
44951,The Very Small Wallet was probably the best wallet I've ever had.,44951,3
44951,It held everything I needed it to hold and was made of a beautiful soft supple black leather.,44951,3
44951,"The Card Pocket, on the other hand, is substantially the same wallet but seems to have been made much more cheaply.",44951,3
44951,"The leather does not feel nearly as soft as the Very Small Wallet, not even close.",44951,3
44951,"I'm not sure if this is actually a decline in the leather quality or if the blue finish on the new wallet is just much less nice than the black finish on the old wallet, maybe Bellroy can comment... but if the blue finish feels cheap and rough compared to the black finish, I would think that they'd tell customers.",44951,3
44952,"I wore for one day and it broke, cheaply made but still cute.",44952,3
44953,I wanted to put winter cap inside of it,44953,3
44954,It's very pretty on and made with a cottony stretchy material that is very thin and airy.,44954,3
44954,My only problem is that the stitching is done very poorly on mine in some parts.,44954,3
44955,"If only the bottoms and top were proportionate, this would've been a super hot bathing suit!",44955,3
44955,"I'm a big booty judy, with a full B chest, size 6/8.",44955,3
44955,I read all of the reviews so decided to be on the safe side and ordered a large.,44955,3
44955,"the bottom fit well, waist a little loose, and the top was made for a woman who's chest was no smaller than Dolly Parton!",44955,3
44955,Was so cute but no way to make it fit without A LOT of alterations and basically cutting half the top off.,44955,3
44956,The hat looks exactly as pictured - it's just that my head is much larger than the mannequin's.,44956,3
44957,"I love the look of all of the bags, and they are roomy.",44957,3
44957,"My main issue is the zipper pulls coming off, and within only a couple of months.",44957,3
44957,"Other than that, I like these!",44957,3
44958,However not all the flower petals are lambskin leather.,44958,3
44958,Several of them are faux leather which is disappointing because that kind of material tends to crack and peel over time and will certainly ruin the look of the bag.,44958,3
44958,The bag is much too expensive to have such cheap material used to make some of the flowers and the description leads consumers to believe that the entire bag is lambskin leather.,44958,3
44959,I wear it As a long tank top definitely not a dress I'm a smaller plus size 14...,44959,3
44960,"Some frayed stitching, rusty buckles, and in consistent strap thicknesses.",44960,3
44961,I am typically a 12 in women's dresses and ordered a large but expected a snug fit.,44961,3
44961,Bust fits ok (surprising!),44961,3
44961,But thigh tummy area is a bit snug.,44961,3
44961,The print is cute but a bit cheap looking in a way.,44961,3
44961,Regardless I'm pairing it with a Cardigan and blazer for more of a finished look.,44961,3
44961,I think it would look better if it fit me as loose as it looks on the model,44961,3
44962,I got a xl it's too tight at bottom kinda big at top  but kute,44962,3
44963,The dress was much shorter and a lot shinier then I expected.,44963,3
44963,"It did fit well and the color was accurate, so l ended up keeping it to use to wear around the house.",44963,3
44964,"Decent shoe, looks slightly cheap in person but good overall.",44964,3
44964,No arch support or traction on the sole but for the price it delivers what is expected.,44964,3
44965,Love the grey/blue together but it's very heavy feeling bc of the length.,44965,3
44965,Also the material will show sweat so definitely will not be wearing in the summer.,44965,3
44965,"Also, it will short painty lines and every pudge in the tummy, hips and rear areas.",44965,3
44965,Will shorten the skirt part to above the knee and wear it in the fall with a high waste slimmer underneath.,44965,3
44966,"The glue sticks to the skin rather than the pasty when it's removed, so not really reusable.",44966,3
44967,The fabric is very thin.,44967,3
44967,If you wear a slip and undershirt it is cute.,44967,3
44968,Low quality but cute.,44968,3
44969,It's cute but I got a large and it barelt fits a friend who is a small b cup!,44969,3
44970,It came a month earlier than Amazon said it would and it's way bigger than I thought it would be too.,44970,3
44970,"There are three compartments where you can put your bills, one zipper compartment and you can put up to 5 cards inside it.",44970,3
44970,"The leather material does not feel cheap at all, nor does the wallet lining and the stitching line is perfect.",44970,3
44970,"After a day though, I tried to pull the zipper to get my coins and it came off.",44970,3
44970,The stitches started ripping off as well when i tried to fix it.,44970,3
44971,Cute looking top but it is too small.,44971,3
44972,"Ir is OK yet the ""H"" drops every time from The belt",44972,3
44973,"This nightshirt was a much better quality than I would have expected, for such a low price.",44973,3
44973,"It's very well made, very good feel.",44973,3
44973,"I had planned to buy two, one for me, one for friend.",44973,3
44973,"When it came I tried it on, and glad I did.",44973,3
44973,"Unfortunately it did not fit, way too snug for me, a size 16-18.",44973,3
44973,"Even for sleeping, it would have been way too tight.",44973,3
44973,"I gave to my friend, a fellow coffee lover.",44973,3
44974,"They seemed like they were good quality, but I had to return them because they did not fit well",44974,3
44975,The quality seems cheap for a van's product .,44975,3
44975,"If you're a female and looking for something not too bulky then don't get these, because they are.",44975,3
44975,The color is creme not white.,44975,3
44975,"I do like the color, however.",44975,3
44976,Runs on the small side.,44976,3
44976,Get a size larger to compensate for the shrinkage.,44976,3
44977,"cheap but, for $1.36 a bargain.",44977,3
44978,Great service from Red Plume Inc.,44978,3
44979,"Great pockets, holds a lot, & cute.",44979,3
44979,The main issue is the zippers are horrid.,44979,3
44979,So cheap & i struggle everytime to open & close the.,44979,3
44980,Doesn't shape well with body,44980,3
44981,My biggest disappointment is the color.,44981,3
44981,"The mint isn't mint at all, it's baby blue.",44981,3
44981,"This top is very pretty and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it, especially with a matching tank top underneath.",44981,3
44981,I felt the fit was a bit too large.,44981,3
44981,However there is no stretch to the material and it's very fragile so you have to order a size or two up to avoid tearing it while putting it on or taking it off.,44981,3
44982,"This item is too SHORT, I am only 5' 4"" with a short torso and the item on bottom was a fine fit but the top was too short to even bare ANY coverage, didn't reach at all.",44982,3
44982,"The cup was so small it wouldn't even give ANY coverage at all, granted I am large but the top was the size of round pickle.",44982,3
44982,"So if you are shorter than 5'4"" with and A/B cup this could work for you.",44982,3
44982,Trust me I loved it and I am so sad it doesn't fit.,44982,3
44983,Awesome sexy but buttons come un snaped to easy.,44983,3
44983,And if your big down there.,44983,3
44983,Get a large pair.,44983,3
44983,Wish thay made one size bigger,44983,3
44984,Hilt is slightly large,44984,3
44985,Good quality jacket so far.,44985,3
44985,Only downside is it's too large for my son.,44985,3
44985,Knowing it stated the sizes run large we still decided to purchase anyway thinking it would fit or child since he is big for his age.,44985,3
44986,"okay quality, good price points, order a size up r two",44986,3
44987,"good quality product, only fault was that the zip was a bit stiff and was hard to unzip",44987,3
44988,The material looks inexpensive.,44988,3
44989,i love the material but fits a bit tight.,44989,3
44990,Was slightly large for my size 7 1/4 hat size.,44990,3
44990,Washed and dried it and bow fits fine.,44990,3
44990,Quality is better than I expected.,44990,3
44991,I probably should have read the reviews.,44991,3
44991,This outfit is well made although only suitable for the bedroom or a sex club given that the skirt is held together by velcro.,44991,3
44991,My shirt had adorable flower buttons that wanted to pop open even though I am only a 36C and bought the large.,44991,3
44991,The material is polyester so if you are used to clothes stretching to accommodate this outfit will not.,44991,3
44991,"The bows are fantastic, but the spandex bands are rather large even if you were only going to use one for a pony tail.",44991,3
44992,The product is great and effective.,44992,3
44992,"Two comments: I based my purchase on the size chart provided, but the jacket is too large.",44992,3
44992,"I normally wear a Medium - bought a Large based on the chart, but a Medium would have been the right decision.",44992,3
44992,"Second, I understood you can pack it, but there was no way I could figure it out.",44992,3
44995,"The large runs small, should be a medium.",44995,3
44996,Previous reviews talked about the tight arm fit.,44996,3
44996,I am a female with very slim arms and it was even tight on me.,44996,3
44996,I bought this for kayaking during the summer so I have not had a chance to check out the uv protection.,44996,3
44997,Shipped fast to my location.,44997,3
44998,Wish it was just a little longer .,44998,3
44998,But great other than that.,44998,3
44999,I ordered two for my twins' baptism.,44999,3
44999,The same snap (bottom right) fell off of both of them the first time I put it on them.,44999,3
44999,They run small and will shrink in wash.,44999,3
45000,"Skirt fit perfectly but I don't like the fabric, is not like the photo.",45000,3
45002,its a fine hat.,45002,3
45003,I had really high hopes for this dress!,45003,3
45003,"The pattern is very cute, and the colors are accurately portrayed online.",45003,3
45003,"The material is kind of like a plastic-y chiffon - not too bad in all honesty, but pretty thin, and needs ironing right out of the package to remove creases.",45003,3
45003,"There is little to no shape in the dress, very boxy, which would be super cute on the right body.",45003,3
45003,"I'm a very pear-shaped person, so I think I need some more structure.",45003,3
45003,It definitely is short.,45003,3
45003,"Being 5'8"", I will need to wear leggings or shorts with the dress.",45003,3
45003,"I wish this dress looked better on me than it does, but overall, the dress is exactly what you should receive for the price!",45003,3

45005,I find myself constantly pulling them up.,45005,3
45006,Its a cute shirt but it's not a genuine Disney large.,45006,3
45006,It was very small on my 8-year old and was not long enough to cover her torso.,45006,3
45006,We intended for it to be a bit big on purpose so she could wear it with leggings.,45006,3
45007,it broken at the middle of the stones,45007,3
45009,I love this however the picture attached to this listing does not accurately reflect the product.,45009,3
45009,I have always wanted one if these necklaces but I will not wear it due to the bail and chain being of cheaper material and having rough edges that got caught in my shirt all day long.,45009,3
45009,"It is a very long necklace, and I actually ended up hanging it at my desk in my office because I love how whimsical it is.",45009,3
45010,Based on the size scale provided what I received is to large hoping washing and drying will adjust them enough to fit...,45010,3
45012,"I love it, but I can't wear it anywhere other than my back yard.",45012,3
45012,"If you're bustier, you're going to have issues with this covering you up enough/keeping you contained, so to speak...but I guess that kind of depends on your modesty level?",45012,3
45012,"I'm 5'9"", 133lb, 32D... it looks really stupid on me, IMO.",45012,3
45013,cute but it runs big!!,45013,3
45013,"All the reviews said size up, but I think this actually fits more like a size large!",45013,3
45013,"I'm 5ft 6""  usually a small in bathing suits, size 4/ 6 for clothes.",45013,3
45014,It's cheaper quality than expected,45014,3

45017,"It is very cute, but very small and not quite as large as described.",45017,3
45017,"Also, for a small bag, the handle is very long and not adjustable.",45017,3
45017,"I'm 5'3"" and the bottom was just a few inches above my knee.",45017,3
45017,It only has one inside zipper pocket and just doesn't hold enough for me.,45017,3
45017,It seems to be well made but just didn't fit my needs.,45017,3
45017,I really wanted to like it - loved the fringe!,45017,3
45018,"The dress is beautiful, but the fabric is so cheap

@AngieOcumarez
[...]",45018,3
45019,Ok a bit thin and some of these shirts come with glitter that gets everywhere,45019,3
45020,I love Brighton jewelry!,45020,3
45020,I thought this was a super deal.....but Brighton Bay is a different company!,45020,3
45020,The metal is not as shiny and the bracelet and necklace I ordered are heavier than Brighton's!,45020,3
45020,"I will keep them, because I like the design, but Brighton it ain't!",45020,3
45020,"I will wear them for casual or work, but not for dressing up.",45020,3
45021,it's pretty but does not glow,45021,3
45022,ok. no room for register by checks,45022,3
45023,Very cute but fits smaller than expected.,45023,3
45024,"Fabric is fairly thin, so it's see through even with flesh toned underwear.",45024,3
45024,"If you buy a larger size than you normally would, it may help, otherwise, plan on wearing spanx or a tunic to cover the bum.",45024,3
45025,"Not the fit or fabric I expected at all, still hanging in the closet",45025,3
45026,"Fits, but is quite short.",45026,3
45026,I usually wear an xl in amreican sizes.,45026,3
45026,"However, the quality is not good I have this in mint and in black and the stiching has had to be fixed on both of them.",45026,3
45026,"Very cute though and I wear them often, with shorts under.",45026,3
45027,Wider at the bottom than I had expected.,45027,3
45028,Photo of the charm is much more clear and detailed than the charm itself.,45028,3
45029,Probably would have been fine had they been true to size.,45029,3
45030,"Great looking design, but runs too small and dye comes off on your hands.",45030,3
45030,Now I'm afraid to wash it and it's too late to return.,45030,3
45031,The panties are too big.,45031,3
45031,Too bad the smallest size is medium.,45031,3
45031,But we are going to fix it somehow.,45031,3
45032,The cleats were really nice and my son was really excited to get them but they were so narrow he couldn't even get his foot into them.,45032,3
45032,Had to return them.,45032,3
45033,I wouldn't say they're to small but way way to short and not wide legs like they say they are,45033,3
45034,I was expecting actual metal but it's just a picture,45034,3
45035,"This dress is obviously made for someone with a model's body, as shown in the picture.",45035,3
45035,Purchased for my gf who is average height and weight and it fit terribly.,45035,3
45035,The panels on the open back don't lay flat.,45035,3
45035,"The material is very thick and well made but that means no matter how you try to iron it, the pleated part of the skirt poofs out too much.",45035,3
45035,It'll make your butt look 3 inches wider.,45035,3
45035,I give it three stars because the customer service was excellent.,45035,3
45035,The first dress my gf ordered was too small and they refunded our money and allowed us to order a larger size with no issue.,45035,3
45038,"It looks nice, I've gotten compliments on it.",45038,3
45038,It's just the clasp.,45038,3
45038,"It's a pain to close and frustrating at time, and it the clasp scratches easily.",45038,3
45038,Aside that its good.,45038,3
45039,"Nice shirt, but I don't see how it's a nursing shirt...if you nurse wearing this, you're just exposing your whole chest to do so.",45039,3
45040,"I love them, BUT they were quite a jump from 7/16g I had which is a size down.",45040,3
45040,I had a hell of a time getting them in.,45040,3
45040,"Basically wait til just after you showered, to make your lobes more elastic, use emu oil to make the transition a wee smoother.",45040,3
45040,All I want to know is why is it so much significantly bigger for a 1mm raise??,45040,3
45041,A little tight on my nieces wrist.,45041,3
45041,The medal broke within a day.,45041,3
45042,Definitely runs very small...,45042,3
45042,I would guess by 2 sizes.,45042,3
45042,"I normally wear a size 10 top (bust is 38"") and the extra large was still too small.",45042,3
45042,Also the material was too thin for me.,45042,3
45042,Pretty color.... but  Sent it back,45042,3
45043,"I have been testing all sorts of "" selfie"" lights.",45043,3
45043,I use my phone to record video and periscope.,45043,3
45043,Selfies actually are the last thing I do with them.,45043,3
45043,"Lol
This particular light preformed ok.",45043,3
45043,It's in the middle of the pack.,45043,3
45043,It is not a bad buy if the price is right.,45043,3
45043,It will light in dark places.,45043,3
45043,It is a clip so you can move it around easily.,45043,3
45043,I was given a discount to use and give my honest opinion in this product.,45043,3
45043,"I with it were brighter
I'm a little scared the on off button will break.",45043,3
45044,"These are super pretty, but only the post is surgical steel.",45044,3
45044,"The rest is not, and turned my wife's nose green.",45044,3
45045,Ordered 2 rings from this same company and both of them turn my finger green.,45045,3
45045,"I bought them because one, they were pretty AND it said they were the 925 silver.",45045,3
45045,"Now, I have a lot of other 925 silver rings that I wear all the time and have no issues.",45045,3
45045,"They are always shiny, but these are not.",45045,3
45045,"I don't think they are marked right, yes they are pretty rings, just like in the picture, but I do not believe that they are real 925 silver as the past experience I have with that metal I have had no issues, these I do.",45045,3
45045,"So if you want a pretty date ring, or evening ring or just a sometimes ring, it works but if you are looking to wear it all the time, I wouldn't, just saying.",45045,3
45046,is good but the fiux lether is peeling no good for me,45046,3
45047,Not what I  expected,45047,3
45048,I love the arrow concept but the points on the arrow going in towards your nipple can be unexpectedly painful should something brush against you.,45048,3
45048,"If you can manage that, they are awesome!",45048,3
45049,"Perfectly OK socks, but socks meant to fit a 4 to 6-year-old should not also fit a size 9.5 woman's foot.",45049,3
45050,This dress fits a little tight in the shoulder and a bit too short for my taste.,45050,3
45050,"It is really cute, but fabric is cheap, with imperfections along the solid part of the back and there is no tag for washing instructions or to identify the brand, size or style.",45050,3
45050,"To return, I would have to pay shipping and send overseas to Shenzhen?",45050,3
45050,Return shipping will cost than the purchase price.,45050,3
45050,"So, I have given it to a friend with narrower shoulders.",45050,3
45050,"From now on, I will check the seller information and be sure not to order from foreign sellers.",45050,3
45051,"Very cute, but very light weight.",45051,3
45051,I bought it for the winter and it is not at all warm enough.,45051,3
45051,Would be great as a summer layer.,45051,3
45052,it is a nice bracelet but way too fragile for an energy fill teenager,45052,3
45053,Definitely order a size or even two sizes up,45053,3
45054,The size large was more like a medium.,45054,3
45055,The dress itself is ok.,45055,3
45055,It's pretty and while the material is a little on the cheap side it's still nice enough.,45055,3
45055,"However, the dress is extremely short.",45055,3
45055,"To be fair I'm pretty tall, and long waisted.",45055,3
45055,I read the reviews that others had mentioned it was short but thought I'd give it a try.,45055,3
45055,I ordered a large ( I normally wear Med-Large) and the fit was good besides the fact that it was so short.,45055,3
45055,"Besides being short, there's a slit up the back that went up higher than my cheeks.",45055,3
45055,If you are tall or long waisted this dress most likely will not work very well for you unless you have in mind to show your goods.,45055,3
45056,"This item looks good and isn't cheaply made, but I did get an allergic reaction to the metal and because of that, I obviously can not wear it.",45056,3
45057,"I love the colors and it fits great, just that they irritate my ear for some reason.",45057,3
45057,I can't sleep with it on or wear it all day because of the irritation.,45057,3
45057,Which is weird because I got one at Claire's and I never had to take it out.,45057,3
45057,So that's my honest review.,45057,3
45059,Love it I'm gong to wear this bling daily.,45059,3
45059,I think it was worth it.,45059,3
45059,"Update 6/24/16
Clasp broke :/ and tarnished on the inside ...",45059,3
45060,"Cute style, but smaller than expected.",45060,3
45061,"Depending on the material I can wear either a large or an x-large, I ended up ordering an x-large and it was way to big.",45061,3
45062,I bought this bag for the bright color and the overall style and shape.,45062,3
45062,"However, the bag is huge!",45062,3
45062,I guess I didn't pay enough attention to that detail (my bad).,45062,3
45062,It can fit my Kindle and a ton of other stuff.,45062,3
45062,"The ""faux leather"" is very stiff.",45062,3
45062,I would give it five stars if the material were looser.,45062,3
45063,These are some fair cheap gloves.,45063,3
45063,they work for us because we go to the mountains only twice/ year and it's not that cold.,45063,3
45064,Too large and the material is very thick..,45064,3
45065,Well built and very nice product.,45065,3
45065,"Only complaints are that the wallet is slightly too large, and the credit cards aren't 'snug' in the compartment, and the cover doesn't completely close on this wallet.",45065,3
45065,"So, if you have this in your shirt pocket, the cards easily spill out.",45065,3
45065,"I have to keep the cards secure, and the cover completely closed, by wrapping a rubber band around the wallet.",45065,3
45066,fun to wear but a bit small,45066,3
45067,but was okay in length.,45067,3
45067,The color is a little lighter blue than in the picture.,45067,3
45068,This is definitely not a dress but more of a tunic.,45068,3
45068,Nice material and true to color.,45068,3
45069,"I'm 5""4"" and weigh 140 lbs.",45069,3
45069,The length of the skirt just reached the floor but if worn with any type of shoe with a heel it would be too short.,45069,3
45069,"I could get the skirt on, however it is too tight and squishes my fat out over top of it.",45069,3
45069,its definitely not one size fits all.,45069,3
45069,it is also see through so you have to watch what color underwear you have on under.,45069,3
45070,"They seem to be skimpy, though,  compared to the other pairs I have from this brand that are a size smaller.",45070,3
45070,So keep that in mind.,45070,3
45070,"The print is more paisley like, not lace-like but they are attractive.",45070,3
45070,Would not order again because of the skimpiness.,45070,3
45071,It's a very nice jacket.,45071,3
45071,I returned it cause It didn't fit me.,45071,3
45071,It was my fault.,45071,3
45072,Shorter at the neck than expected,45072,3
45073,Hard to get zipped.,45073,3
45074,"I bought this hoping to use it under my helmet snowboarding, but it does not work with a helmet unless your helmet is way too big for you.",45074,3
45074,This would be great for cold weather if you don't intend to wear a helmet.,45074,3
45074,"But for me riding without a helmet is risky, and thus I don't consider this a real ""ski"" or ""snowboarding"" face mask.",45074,3
45074,"It does seem relatively warm and wind resistant (I wouldn't say ""windproof""), and the quality is good.",45074,3
45074,So if you don't plan on using this with a helmet this might be for you.,45074,3
45074,If you need something to work with a helmet look elsewhere.,45074,3
45075,Didn't like how it fit.,45075,3
45076,Love the fit but the belt was sewn on backwards and the dress is thin..getting it lined and fixed tonight.,45076,3
45077,Really pretty and seems to be pretty good quality but really small I ordered an XL because I wanted a fit like the photo but it was more like  medium.,45077,3
45078,I wish the had describe the material as very shiny,45078,3
45079,"Product looked like picture, sizing was way off",45079,3
45080,"I returned it and am expecting another style, it ran small, I fit in it but if I wore anything but a light tshirt it would have been snug.",45080,3
45082,Very nice lining inside.,45082,3
45082,Comfortable but run a little snug mostly width wise.,45082,3
45082,I wear a 9 and med to narrow width and they fit comfortable but snug.,45082,3
45082,I use these for yard work so usually do not wear socks in them (incase dirt gets inside I can just rinse off) and the lining is comfortable and keeps me from getting blisters and my feet don't get to hot.,45082,3
45082,Would have given 5 stars but the first time I wore them the little buckle came off of one boot.,45082,3
45082,I'm assuming it broke off since they don't seem to be removable.,45082,3
45082,I was only walking the yard checking sprinklers so there wasn't any strain on it that could have caused it.,45082,3
45082,So that was pretty disappointing since it holds that adjustment piece down and looked better.,45082,3
45082,The other side has stayed on just fine and I have used them a lot now so it must not be something that happens all the time.,45082,3
45082,Oh and there are removable insole (little thin ones) that I threw away because they come out every time you take you foot out and fixing it constantly became annoying and they are fine without it.,45082,3
45083,"Nicely made, but the size runs small, so beware.",45083,3
45084,Bottom fit just right.,45084,3
45084,Top was a little small and fit weird but was still cute.,45084,3
45085,This would actually be beautiful if it fit correctly.,45085,3
45085,Perhaps they should make it in different sizes.,45085,3
45085,One size fit all does not work with this product.,45085,3
45085,Picture is a bit different from product itself.,45085,3
45087,"It's ok, but doesn't look the same on as picture shows",45087,3
45088,fit ok but faded really badly by third wash,45088,3
45089,Fits my youngest daughter.,45089,3
45090,Every Part of the Jumpsuit Fits except the one Sleeve and the Material is SEE THROUGH!,45090,3
45091,"This requires the individual to be able to hook the clasp rather than just pull on - very difficult for teenagers, or people with joint problems in their hands.",45091,3
45093,"I ordered two of these, one in black and one in white.",45093,3
45093,"From reading  past reviews I ordered a Large, I am usually a medium.",45093,3
45093,"The fit is great, the length is a little short.",45093,3
45093,Could be about two inches longer.,45093,3
45093,"The white is very thin fabric, so I will be wearing this as PJ's.",45093,3
45093,"If I was 20 years younger, the thin fabric would not be an issue.",45093,3
45093,The black fit the same but is not as see through.,45093,3
45093,I wore this to walk on the beach (with a bra).,45093,3
45093,"Very cute design, love the strappy back.",45093,3
45093,"Would I wear this out and about,  No.",45093,3
45093,"For walking on the beach and for my age,  50+,  it is fine.",45093,3
45094,Very pretty dress but not the best quality.,45094,3
45094,Sequins began falling off before I put it on and seams are ripping on the inside.,45094,3
45094,"Was okay for prom as it was only worn for about 5 hours and is beautiful, but I've gotten higher quality prom dresses for cheaper.",45094,3
45095,"Very cute, but WAY too big.",45095,3
45096,"I actually really love the piece, the quartz crystal and the holder and chain are beautiful, but it got 3 stars because all of the stones on the front fell off in the bag when it was shipped...and those that didn't fell off in a week!",45096,3
45097,"This is a Christmas gift, therefore, I can only give my own opinion, it is a very nice card sleeve and I like it, however, will have to update this after Christmas when the gift is given.",45097,3
45097,Reason for only 3 stars at this time.,45097,3
45098,Just don't pack too much in it.,45098,3
45098,Straps ripped after only two weeks!,45098,3
45099,Looks nice the only thing is that when it was packed to ship it was folded in half so it has a crease.,45099,3
45099,So all the bands are like permanently folded,45099,3
45100,Noise piece fell off.,45100,3
45100,Manufacturer to replace them.,45100,3
45101,The adult size is very small.,45101,3
45101,"I am someone with a small head too, so I feel that this would not fit normal people very well.",45101,3
45101,"I could wear for pictures, but not for long amounts of time.",45101,3
45102,"Nice piece, but way to petite for my needs...",45102,3
45103,"These socks are really cute, but for an adult size 7, they are too tight fitting.",45103,3
45104,"I received the idem in a few days, the dress was too small on top.",45104,3
45104,I had no problem getting a refund.,45104,3
45106,"My wife likes the purse however, the gun compartment, which is formed for a gun, has some issues.",45106,3
45106,There is to much material in the pouch.,45106,3
45106,This causes the gun to catch when removing it.,45106,3
45106,The material is not sewed at the top all the way across.,45106,3
45106,Just where the zipper is.,45106,3
45106,This causes the gun mussel to point down in the purse making it sit as basically a 45 degree angle.,45106,3
45106,That also contributes to issues removing the weapon.,45106,3
45106,This is a nice purse but don't expect to be able to draw a weapon out quickly even after you get your hand on it.,45106,3
45106,Perhaps if it were made of a smoother material.,45106,3
45107,The fabric used for the pants is super thin - the white parts are actually see though.,45107,3
45107,The 6-9 month size fits my 14 pound 4 month old.,45107,3
45107,The pants are ridiculously long to the point that it's funny.,45107,3
45107,For $7 though I can't complain.,45107,3
45108,its ok for the money its good,45108,3
45109,"Very pretty the way it fits me, but after only a few wears it's showing some damage.",45109,3
45109,"I can't figure out if it's a heat mark or the beginnings of a run, like with nylon stockings.",45109,3
45109,But it looks lighter than the surrounding material and so it looks like a stain on the front of my shirt.,45109,3
45109,The material definitely doesn't hold up long.,45109,3
45109,I wore and washed it under typical circumstances so I didn't expect this to happen.,45109,3
45110,its a beautiful blouse but man are the sizes completely off..,45110,3
45113,Hat was too small for my newborn.,45113,3
45113,She was 7lbs 12oz.,45113,3
45113,Thought it could have been a little bigger.,45113,3
45115,"Adorable, but tight fitting in the chest",45115,3
45116,It's okay but  a bit small,45116,3
45117,The top fits fine if you are smaller up top.,45117,3
45117,"The bottom is several sizes too large, so not sure who this is supposed to fit.",45117,3
45117,But the overall effect works,45117,3
45118,Excellent quality but is American size scale.,45118,3
45118,We usually buy a size larger because European sizes run smaller.,45118,3
45118,I will need to try to exchange this for a smallereason size.,45118,3
45118,Would give it a 5 if it fit.,45118,3
45119,My fault but smaller than I expected,45119,3
45120,"item ok, looks better on website",45120,3
45121,Isnt as flattering as it looks..materials stretched out,45121,3
45122,The materials was really thin and it didn't fit properly.,45122,3
45122,It was really small even after using the size chart.,45122,3
45123,These are very light weight.,45123,3
45123,"I bought the xl for my 14 year old (size 38 waist) and they are so small that my 10 year old has them now, still a little tight on him.",45123,3
45123,My son has had them for a few weeks and there is a hole in the crotch.,45123,3
45123,"On the bright side, my son likes them so much he is living in them.",45123,3
45124,I ordered this shirt in medium as a Christmas gift for my teenage son who is tall and slender.,45124,3
45124,He usually wears a men's medium in his T-Shirts.,45124,3
45124,This shirt looked to be the same as his others out of the package but after several washings it has shrunk quite a bit.,45124,3
45124,He can still wear it but it looks a lot smaller than it did when we bought it.,45124,3
45124,I don't have experience with the next size larger so it's hard to say if the proportions would be correct to order up a size.,45124,3
45124,"In any case, be aware that this shirt will shrink.",45124,3
45124,"It could be air dried, of course, but that's extra care we don't usually have to do on his shirts.",45124,3
45125,they are not a large,45125,3
45126,It has the same design as pictured but is very cheaply sewn.,45126,3
45127,I am a pretty small guy (size 28 waist and XS or S in everything).,45127,3
45127,However this was tiny!,45127,3
45127,It didn't fit me at all.,45127,3
45127,The quality was nice and everything else was fine but I would definitely get a size or two up.,45127,3
45128,"Very cute, but runs big.",45128,3
45128,"Also, it's longer than I was expecting.",45128,3
45129,"I bought this for my daughter and she hated it, does not really fit or look like it does in the picture.",45129,3
45130,"I got several of these and they look nice unless they accidentally end up in the dryer, then they are ruined.",45130,3
45130,I'm petite small and they are skin tight.,45130,3
45130,I find the material not breathable enough for hot weather.,45130,3
45131,These sandals are very nice and I love the color.,45131,3
45131,"They did not work for me, though, because they are designed to correct over-pronation, so be aware of that.",45131,3
45132,"From the pictures, I thought I would be getting something a little more sturdy.",45132,3
45132,"I know it is a soft gel case, but it seemed a bit too thin, and it was a bit loose, not fitting snugly and wiggling around a bit on the sides.",45132,3
45132,It irritated me whenever I held my phone.,45132,3
45132,I stayed with my old case instead.,45132,3
45132,"Also, the sides were clear, not white like it seems in the picture.",45132,3
45132,"On the plus side, the design was very attractive, exactly as shown, and the buttons weren't covered by the case.",45132,3
45132,"Decent, just not solid enough for me.",45132,3
45134,It didn't fit tight in the stomach and bittom.,45134,3
45135,"It is what it is when purchasing clothes like these, but the pattern is cute.",45135,3
45135,"I suggest ordering one or two sizes down, the fabric doesn't hang...it sticks straight out, defying gravity, so if it's too big you'll also look too big.",45135,3
45136,Looks diff has weird ears n pink cheeks meh oh well thats what i get for trusting internet lol,45136,3
45137,I bought a size larger and it was too small.,45137,3
45137,I guess this is incentive for me to lose weight.,45137,3
45137,I did not see any obvious product flaws other than sizing is not what is advertised.,45137,3
45138,"I got the white version, and it's a tiny bit see-through.",45138,3
45138,"Normally I'd wear nude underwear and be fine with it, but you can clearly see the entire giant pocket through the dress!",45138,3
45138,"I liked the dress otherwise, the fabric is nicely heavy, and the fit is nice.",45138,3
45138,"I eventually got a tailor to cut off the pockets and pocket flaps, and sew everything shut.",45138,3
45138,Now it looks pretty good.,45138,3
45139,"Loving the material and the color, but the top part was small and not a push up bra.",45139,3
45140,Very stiff uncomfortable fabric,45140,3
45141,"Cute, light and comfy but if this is a maternity skirt I must be a monkey's uncle.",45141,3
45141,"The hem is the same length all around (maternity skirts worn under the belly should be shorter in front and longer in back) and the waist doesn't seem cut for a pregnant belly, so it pushes the hem down farther in the front than in back.",45141,3
45141,It fits my pregnant shape better as a maxi dress but then it's not as long as I'd like...  Also just FYI you need shape wear or some kind of similar undergarment under this piece due to the thinness of the fabric.,45141,3
45141,I might just hang onto this for an after-I-give-birth piece to wear.,45141,3
45142,The sides are rippled on the shirt and it comes up to my sides but other than that it's cute.,45142,3
45143,"Way too big and shiny for my septum, but it might be just right for someone else.",45143,3
45144,I got this as a gift for my son that is learning to tell the time.,45144,3
45144,I thought it would be a good way to learn since it has the seconds minutes and hour hand.,45144,3
45144,Now i went behind my son's back and got him the one i liked and not what he liked and to my disappointment the numbers to help him read the minutes on the outher part of the watch is missing.,45144,3
45144,Not what i was expecting would have chosen a different design had i know,45144,3
45146,Three stars for the appearance it is really cute.,45146,3
45146,"However, it was missing loops which disconnected one side from the other.",45146,3
45146,"Luckily for me, I make jewelry and was able to fix it.",45146,3
45146,One of the earring backs didn't fit and my earring came out so I used a different back.,45146,3
45146,"Once everything was put together, it was pretty and I received many compliments.",45146,3
45147,"It's small, but I guess it's Okay..",45147,3
45147,It matches my flower basket..,45147,3
45147,"If you are looking for one, I suggest you find a better one.",45147,3
45148,"I read the reviews and ordered an XL but, it fits like a size small; seriously.",45148,3
45148,I am a size 12 with a 38 inch bust and this thing was not gonna work at all.,45148,3
45148,Such a shame because the 3 colors I got are absolutely exquisite!,45148,3
45149,"I bought a pair of these in my size, but they are too small.",45149,3
45149,I can get my feet in them but not comfortably.,45149,3
45149,It's too bad because I can tell the soles are comfortable.,45149,3
45149,"Of course, now I've work them to work so I can't return them.",45149,3
45151,"wish it was a bit thicker and the zipper is a hassle (I just leave it zipped to avoid the hassle, but defeats the purpose of having a zipper)",45151,3
45152,It's not even close to one size fits all.,45152,3
45152,It's not even one size fits some.,45152,3
45152,"I bought this for my oldest daughters, one of whom wears a size 10/12 and the other of whom wears a size 7/8 in women's clothing.",45152,3
45152,It only fits the smaller one.,45152,3
45152,"I don't consider ""fits up to a size medium"" to be one size.",45152,3
45152,"Moreover, the fabric is stiff and doesn't drape well at all, and thus the skirt is kind of ugly in person.",45152,3
45152,The waistband is poorly done; the gathering isn't close to even.,45152,3
45153,I bought this shirt to wear in a super hero 5K.,45153,3
45153,"It serves it's purpose for that setting but if I wanted to wear it out in a more public setting, I couldn't.",45153,3
45153,I bought a large because I'm very tall and have a long torso.,45153,3
45153,It was very short.,45153,3
45153,It was also very see through.,45153,3
45153,"However, it served its purpose for 5ks and doing some cleaning around the house.",45153,3
45154,"looks cheaper than expected, but generally OK to wear",45154,3
45156,"First off I brought this bathing suit for a girls trip to Jamaica, I thought it would be perfect being that it was the same color as the Jamaican flag.",45156,3
45156,"Boy was I surprised when I received it and it was army green, yellow and black.",45156,3
45156,"I then had to figure something out so I ordered some green stretch scuba fabric on amazon and had my friends mom who is a seamstress cover the army green on the panty with the green fabric I brought, and also remove the army green from the top and add the green fabric too.",45156,3
45156,Then I tried it on and although I was pleased with the color of the bathing suit I now didn't like the way the top fit I thought it didn't have enough support for my breast so I purchased a black bra for like $5 and I got my needle and thread and I went to work and I now absolutely love this bathing suit and I cant wait to wear it in Jamaica.,45156,3
45156,Overall I'm pleased because although it wasn't the color that was shown online it did provide me with a template of what I was kind of looking for so with the enhancements I paid an additional $15 so not too bad.,45156,3
45156,"Note: The picture on the left is the bathing is the bathing suit I received, The picture on the right is my creation!!",45156,3
45157,I like the dress very pretty but super short maybe with shorts underneath I can pull it off...,45157,3
45158,"tight fit, heels wear out VERY quickly",45158,3
45159,Cut case...but the stand feels a lil cheap,45159,3
45161,"This was a pretty color, but this ""heather"" version is unpleasantly rough-textured, unlike other shirts of this type I've tried.",45161,3
45161,"I usually wear a 10-12, and the large was unflatteringly clingy.",45161,3
45161,An XL might have worked.,45161,3
45162,"Nicely made dress, but way too small with no stretch.",45162,3
45163,Like it but Little tight in the.,45163,3
45164,Picture on the mousepad is not as clear as it looks on the screen here.,45164,3
45166,It's not what I expected.,45166,3
45166,I wish u would have listened to the others who said it was a waste of money.,45166,3
45166,I am iffy about this.,45166,3
45166,The bottoms fit perfect but I can't get the top like they have it in the picture so I did it a different way.,45166,3
45166,It's nice I guess.,45166,3
45166,I'm not 100% happy but I'm also not 100% disappointed.,45166,3
45166,Glad I only brought one style instead of several like I was planning to do at first I just wish I could get it like the pic but this way is fine,45166,3
45167,It is smaller that it appears to be.,45167,3
45168,A bit fitted but overall good quality,45168,3
45169,Nice dress just wish it didn't fit so snug ....looking for more of the maxi-dress feel!,45169,3
45170,fits strange in shoulders,45170,3
45171,I ordered 8 dresses 50s style for a Dress Your Favorite Decade party I am attending next week.,45171,3
45171,"I am a 43 year old stay at home mom, my measurements are 44/34/44 and I am 5'8"" and the XL fit well and was generally flattering.",45171,3
45171,The fabric of this dress is thinner and very stretchy.,45171,3
45171,I would say if you have any lumps and bumps be prepared to batten down the hatches with some shape wear!,45171,3
45171,Ultimately I am sending it back and keeping another swing dress with polka dots and 3/4 sleeves made by Heroecol.,45171,3
45172,The seem attaching the inner most part of the silky material looks shoddy but it isn't falling apart yet.,45172,3
45172,"Although I haven't worn it yet, just tried it on.",45172,3
45172,The cups are a bit high but it seems like it's supposed to be worn with a dress bra not a regular bra.,45172,3
45172,"I love the color and it looks great but again I haven't put any mileage on it (never worn, or cleaned.)",45172,3
45173,Nice skirt but the fit was off a bit and it wasn't what I expected in looks.,45173,3
45173,Returning it but it may work for others....,45173,3
45174,I am a petite medium (P10).,45174,3
45174,"This is listed as petite sizing, but it isn't.",45174,3
45174,The tag lists it as a regular.,45174,3
45174,I ordered a large (thinking it was a large PETITE) after reading that people found it to run small.,45174,3
45174,Big mistake for me.,45174,3
45174,"I can't speak for regular ladies, but if you wear petite sizes, DO NOT order a size up.",45174,3
45175,Little loose but it's cute,45175,3
45176,Usually a 2x would be waaay too big.,45176,3
45176,Couldn't get it down over my hips.,45176,3
45177,"Received many compliments and loved this as a replacement for my set that's too big- however a small stone fell out, less than a year later.",45177,3
45178,"I ordered a size 28 dress ( the blue one), while the dress is as it looks on the pictures the buckle on the dress was off center and thee underlying of the dress was too long.",45178,3
45178,Both easy fixes and worth it because I love the dress.,45178,3
45178,The reason they got 3 stars is because I also asked for a Shawl or piece of material.,45178,3
45178,I thought Like other companies I've ordered from they'd be more than happy to accommodate me with this request for free or even for a fee.,45178,3
45178,This wasn't the case.,45178,3
45178,I paid $35 bucks for a piece if material that had runs in it ( its chiffon) and it barely wraps around my shoulders!,45178,3
45178,I clearly asked for a 60' by 60' of material if they weren't gonna send a finished product since they said they couldn't make a shawl and I got WAAAAAAAY LESS than what I paid for!,45178,3
45178,Upsetting to say the least but I know better for now and the dress came from China but it shipped and arrived on time.,45178,3
45178,Great dress blah company.,45178,3
45180,I bought this for my father and he loves it.,45180,3
45180,"But the problem is that the hat came in a small package, so when they put the hat in it squished the hat because of how small the package was since the hat is made of straw.",45180,3
45180,Other that I had no problem with it.,45180,3
45182,Pretty but too big,45182,3
45183,Size runs a bit small.,45183,3
45183,Will be exchanging for a larger size.,45183,3
45184,The purple one is nowhere near as the nice as the pink one.,45184,3
45184,I should know since I own both.,45184,3
45184,The pink one is of a softer leather and is better constructed overall.,45184,3
45184,Both have a problem with the window for the ID since it is slightly too large and the ID falls out.,45184,3
45185,Couldn't get this over my head.,45185,3
45185,Okay quality for one time use.,45185,3
45186,I ordered this dress in Aqua.,45186,3
45186,"I was expecting a more lightish blue color, and I received a mint/institutional green color.",45186,3
45186,"The chest is way too big for the dress, it lays funny no matter how you iron it.",45186,3
45186,"The rest of the dress lays and fits like it should, but the top is so odd I will not wear alone as I had purchased it for.",45186,3
45186,It is cute when I put a ton of pins in it to hold the top in place and wear a shrug over it.,45186,3
45186,"It is not my favorite, but I do think if it wouldn't have been green I would have like it.",45186,3
45187,It fit as expected when it arrived...however....I hand washed it in cold water and hung to dry as directed and it shrunk.,45187,3
45187,Still looks good so I gave it to someone who is smaller than me.,45187,3
45188,Doesn't go over the bum like a tunic as the picture shows.,45188,3
45188,"That said, it's a nice TShirt.",45188,3
45189,Arrived and to small and it's extra large ?,45189,3
45189,I wear 12 and this shirt to tight,45189,3
45190,I don't love them just because my earlobes aren't super thick and these run wide.,45190,3
45190,I suppose if you had thicker lobes they'd look fine.,45190,3
45191,it was a bit too small for my 9 yr old,45191,3
45192,awkward placement/ cheap fabric,45192,3
45193,The product was delivered as represented but I do not wear them for this reason.,45193,3
45193,They also tend to fall off.,45193,3
45194,It really nice for the price but if have a butt of hips go 2 sizes up,45194,3
45195,The top part (cup size) is really big.,45195,3
45195,Everywhere else is very tight and fits great.,45195,3
45195,To much fabric up top.,45195,3
45196,LOVE the bag but the zipper keeps separating and the bag opens exposing contents.,45196,3
45196,Can be frustrating and risky.,45196,3
45196,Afraid of losing items.,45196,3
45197,"I love the fit, look and feel of these socks but many of the rubber dots came off on first use at barre class.",45197,3
45198,OK hat ---- lettering is not bright and looks a little,45198,3
45199,"The material is weird, clingy.",45199,3
45200,"I love Havaianas and have worn them for years, always buying them here on Amazon.",45200,3
45200,This summer they are not the same.,45200,3
45200,"I'm usually a 6, 35/36.",45200,3
45200,This year they are coming in stamped 6W.,45200,3
45200,Nothing in the description says they are Wide width.,45200,3
45200,"They are also longer, sizing up to about 7.",45200,3
45200,Not the same quality.,45200,3
45200,Maybe these are fake?,45200,3
45200,"Also, I have received 2 pairs that the strap is twisted due to the rubber bands they put on them for packaging.",45200,3
45200,I have also sent those back because it does not sit properly on the top of foot.,45200,3
45201,"The best I have found for the purpose, but I still cannot get them to stay on all day.",45201,3
45202,"I'm a US size 12 (5'3"" and 185 pounds) but the XL doesn't fit me.",45202,3
45202,Oh well - I will find someone to donate it to.,45202,3
45203,Too small and shrunk even smaller.,45203,3
45204,The inside has a lining that I didn't expect.,45204,3
45204,"Although the lining could be considered a sign of quality, I didn't appreciate it because I wanted a hat that would let air circulate and keep my head cool",45204,3
45205,Can't be used for maternity because the bottom hem is too small.,45205,3
45205,I wish it had a few princess seems at the waist under the bust so it would lay nicer.,45205,3
45205,I ordered a size up because of the reviews that it runs small.,45205,3
45205,The sleeves are just a little too short for long sleeve and not long enough for 3/4 sleeves.,45205,3
45205,"I will be tailoring it so it will fit me better, because I love the pattern and overall style.",45205,3
45206,I got it good bag.,45206,3
45206,But you didn't give to me chain.,45206,3
45206,short & long both.,45206,3
45206,How can i get it?,45206,3
45207,"Well made, but scratches to easy for the money you pay!",45207,3
45209,"The quality is good, I and 5' 7"" and ordered a M and it too short.",45209,3
45209,I mean you can see my behind hanging out.,45209,3
45210,fake blood what else is there to say,45210,3
45211,"I purchased this along with another sweater the same 3x size and this one is more like an extra large, I gave it to a friend much smaller than myself and they are enjoying it.",45211,3
45212,I'll need to return this because it was too big for my face.,45212,3
45212,It literally takes up half my face!,45212,3
45213,The shipping on this item was pretty decent.,45213,3
45213,"You would expect this sweater to be baggy and oversized, but it's not.",45213,3
45213,I was not aware of that because there is no model pictured in this sweater.,45213,3
45213,The sleeves are very short and the sweater itself is cropped.,45213,3
45213,"For me personally, I was not a fan.",45213,3
45213,I like my tops and sweaters to be a bit oversized and this was not.,45213,3
45213,"I'm not saying this isn't a good sweater or that it isn't cute, if you like the 3/4 sleeve look and cropped sweaters this is perfect for you.",45213,3
45213,"But if you're expecting an oversized sweater, don't buy this.",45213,3
45214,Ties do not allow for you to adjust the width for different sizes of necks.,45214,3
45215,Gets tangled in my beck when worn long time.,45215,3
45216,Cute top..I just ordered too big thinking it would fit...returning to exchange for a smaller one.,45216,3
45217,"I didn't realize that the red upper half of the dress made ro look like a jacket, was actually attached as part of the dress.",45217,3
45217,Not loving that look,45217,3
45218,Snug all over and long.,45218,3
45218,I'm 5'2 and like to wear heels and it's still too long.,45218,3
45219,I didn't realize they're 14g they're trally big if you're looking for a piercing get 16g,45219,3
45220,dress is just ok. not linen at the top but a cheap stretch cotton material that is a different white than the linen.,45220,3
45221,This was made of a very thin gauze like material.,45221,3
45221,It would need a full slip under it as it is quite sheer.,45221,3
45221,"It wasn't flattering on me, nor did it end up being my style.",45221,3
45222,I ordered navy blue and it's definitely black.,45222,3
45222,The sleeves are perfect and fit comfortably.,45222,3
45222,The body of the shirt is long and wide.,45222,3
45222,Makes it feel like a pajama shirt and is not flattering at all.,45222,3
45222,It would be cute with leggings and boots in the fall.,45222,3
45223,DID NOT FIT RIGHT GAVE TO MY DAU,45223,3
45224,Jeans had a tight stretch to it!,45224,3
45224,I did received the wrong shade but had to make it work!,45224,3
45224,It was also a tad bit too long!,45224,3
45226,I really wanted to make it work but it's just an odd shape.,45226,3
45226,"I ordered a large (I usually wear a 4) and it fits perfectly in the shoulders and arms, but the rest is way too big.",45226,3
45226,It takes the loose fit to the extreme.,45226,3
45227,Good enough especially for the price.,45227,3
45227,I thought it would fit like the others I have purchased from this brand.,45227,3
45227,"This one is really ,,,, really small ....",45227,3
45228,"Much larger and heavier than I was expecting, but very nice handbag",45228,3
45229,these fit really tight in the hips.,45229,3
45229,"also have a very large catch area, almost like they are suppsed to be high waisted.",45229,3
45229,Overall god underwear for the price.,45229,3
45229,Comfortable and nice material.,45229,3
45230,My first pair came broken so I had to order another one,45230,3
45231,Somewhat disappointed in the quality of the shirt.,45231,3
45231,"The shoulders are large, but length of sleeves good.",45231,3
45232,it's cute it fits but it's see through,45232,3
45233,Fabric quality is good but this is not anywhere near being long.,45233,3
45234,It looked just like it does in the picture and fit nicely.,45234,3
45234,The shorts were very cute and fit nicely (something that is hard to find for large butts!).,45234,3
45234,"Unfortunately, the zipper on the bodice was broken when it arrived.",45234,3
45235,Top fit perfectly but the bottoms were way too small.,45235,3
45235,I have a very athletic figure and I usually wear a M in the top and a L in bottoms in swim wear.,45235,3
45235,I ordered the XL after looking at other reviews and the top was perfect but the bottoms didn't stand a chance.,45235,3
45235,The XL bottoms fit me more how a small would normally fit me in swim wear.,45235,3
45235,"I could get them on, but man they were unflattering.",45235,3
45235,There is essentially no stretch to the them at all.,45235,3
45235,"I will say though, if you are a smaller bottomed girl, this suit is surprisingly good quality for the price.",45235,3
45235,"I do believe it is real neoprene, which I was shocked about!",45235,3
45235,"I own a lot of neoprene (wetsuits and swim suits) and this feels about the same, though has much less stretch than my other neoprene products.",45235,3
45235,"The straps are a little flimsy, but the suit itself is a nice sturdy material.",45235,3
45235,The colors are spot on as well.,45235,3
45235,I will keep the set for the top because it is quite flattering and nice!,45235,3
45236,"I liked the style of it, but the material was very thin and cheap-looking.",45236,3
45236,I returned the grey one and got the white one instead.,45236,3
45236,It was also a lot larger than I expected.,45236,3
45236,"I usually wear a size large for shirts because I like things to fit a little baggy, but after reading reviews, I decided to get the medium.",45236,3
45236,It was still pretty large and the slit in the side goes up waaaay higher than I would've liked.,45236,3
45236,"Again, I ordered the grey and disliked the material, but I really like the white one.",45236,3
45237,I like the set but the crop top runs too small,45237,3
45238,I ordered a size up knowing this though based on other reviews.,45238,3
45238,My son loves the patterns,45238,3
45240,I really wanted to like these shoe lights.,45240,3
45240,It really is a good concept and would be so perfect for running or walking at night or early morning if they would only stay on my shoes!,45240,3
45240,I have worn these shoe clips for two mornings now.,45240,3
45240,"I clip them to the back of my shoes and they stay on for about 15 minutes, then they pop right off.",45240,3
45240,"The past  two mornings during mid run, the clips flew off my shoes and dashed across the street.",45240,3
45240,This morning it happened right as a car was coming by and the car's tire narrowly missed the shoe light that went flying across the street.,45240,3
45240,I have tried putting these clips on my shoes every way possible and I can not seem to keep them on my shoes.,45240,3
45240,I ended up clipping them to the back of my waist band while I finished my run.,45240,3
45240,"Like I said above, these shoes lights are a good concept.",45240,3
45240,I like the bright green light that can be seen from pretty far away.,45240,3
45240,The button to turn the light on is easy to use and they are made of heavy duty plastic so when they hit the pavement they will not break.,45240,3
45240,I know this from experience.,45240,3
45240,If I continue to use these lights I will probably keep them clipped on my waist band.,45240,3
45240,***DISCLAIMER*** I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,45240,3
45241,Very warm nice fleece only complaint that I have is and has a weird smell like petroleum or gasoline substance I recommend to wash it first to get rid of the smell after that it was fine,45241,3
45242,"The color seems off but they are beautiful, just beware that they are a double flare and may be hard to insert into ears.",45242,3
45243,Very pretty & nice quality.,45243,3
45243,It's nice and small as I wanted.,45243,3
45243,Only reason for not giving a 5 star (and this has nothing to do with the seller as they are not responsible for this - they were GREAT)!,45243,3
45243,The cuff doesn't stay on and is hard to adjust (bend) to stay on.,45243,3
45243,"I do have very small ears and not much for the cuff to cling to, but it would be nice to wear nonetheless.",45243,3
45243,"I am afraid of losing it, it's so pretty.",45243,3
45245,"Not the highest quality, but it worked well enough for my uses.",45245,3
45245,I wouldn't expect to use this many times.,45245,3
45246,"The dress looked nice, but had a hole in the side seem.",45246,3
45246,It was also was more see through than what the picture shows.,45246,3
45247,I sent it back don't know what happen to it.,45247,3
45249,"it's ok......you get what you pay for, does for my daughters play clothes",45249,3
45250,The charm is heavy I like that part but the chain broke the same day I got it,45250,3
45251,"It's a very cute dress but it doesn't just run small, it runs way, way, way, too small.",45251,3
45251,I read the reviews and ordered a size larger than I wear and was surprised at how far off the sizing was.,45251,3
45251,I usually wear a 3x and ordered a 4x - boy was I shocked when I took it out of the package because it looks like a size 10.,45251,3
45251,It wasn't even close to the size I ordered.,45251,3
45251,"Since it is a cute dress (and that's the only reason I gave it 3 stars), I'm going to give it to one of my sisters.",45251,3
45251,I was very disappointed.,45251,3
45252,Smaller than anticipated..It is pretty but there is no give at all in the fabric.,45252,3
45253,Cute but the button broke ..not to happy about that at all :(,45253,3
45254,"The color is more of a rusty red, not red wine as described.",45254,3
45254,The fit was true to size and the fabric wasn't too bad considering how cheap it was to purchase.,45254,3
45254,The reason I returned it was because the bottom panel in the front felt like it didn't cover enough to be considered a double-breasted trench coat.,45254,3
45254,It felt more like a single breasted coat that was off-centered instead.,45254,3
45255,Too small but appears to be made of quality,45255,3
45256,The size I ordered was too big so I ended up returning.,45256,3
45258,this is just ok..,45258,3
45259,"Was too small right after birth but 4 days after started to fit, we'll see how it works",45259,3
45260,"The material is thick and stretchy, color is just slightly cream.",45260,3
45260,3 stars because it fits a little wonky.,45260,3
45260,The sides gape open a bit making me look wide and the top half needs to be adjusted all the time.,45260,3
45260,The seams roll in and it looks sloppy.,45260,3
45260,"I'll still wear it, but I was hoping it'd look classier.",45260,3
45261,Bought this product for my brother...its smaller than we expected and two of the zipper already fell off but other from that thus bag is made from a sturdy material,45261,3
45262,It broke 2 days after i got it,45262,3
45263,A little thinner than any Doublju I've ever owned.,45263,3
45264,smaller than the one I have so I don't like it.,45264,3
45266,Doesn't quite stay true to fitment the more you wash.,45266,3
45266,The midsection really stretches out,45266,3
45267,"These boots are gorgeous, but are too tight in the toes for my wide feet.",45267,3
45267,"Usually a size 10 with rounded toes is a great fit, but it left me with a pinched toe and some blisters.",45267,3
45267,Would recommend for people who tend to have wide feet or trouble getting shoes that fit to buy half a size up.,45267,3
45268,The shoulder strap of the dress snapped off once I got it.,45268,3
45269,The color is great but the wallet is too flimsy for my liking.,45269,3
45269,Would not buy again.,45269,3
45270,Too thin to wear in public.,45270,3
45270,My daughter wears them as pajamas.,45270,3
45271,Like the fit and style.,45271,3
45271,Only problem was after just a couple washes they're already coming apart at the seams,45271,3
45272,They only shipped me ONE earring!,45272,3
45272,I'm pretty sure earrings are supposed to come in pairs of 2.,45272,3
45272,"Also - the length of the rod is so long, that the back tail sits so far away from my ear, it looks a little odd.",45272,3
45272,Other than that - quality of actual earring is good.,45272,3
45273,"Somewhere between a dress and a top, its cut nice but the material is super see through.",45273,3
45273,"Not sure how I am going to wear it, I'm going to need coverage underneath, I'm pretty average build 5' 7""",45273,3
45274,Strap tore within a month but was able to be resewn,45274,3
45275,this is a vibrant and beautiful bracelet.,45275,3
45275,"however, I guess I didn't read this correctly.",45275,3
45275,"according to the pic, it looks as though it is a ""wrap"" bracelet with stretch.",45275,3
45275,it is cut down the middle on one side to slip over like a cuff bracelet.,45275,3
45275,I will still wear it.,45275,3
45275,but I won't buy another.,45275,3
45276,I love this chain but the material is cheap,45276,3
45277,"Had the bubble in it, but I think it maybe is supposed to be that way.",45277,3
45277,On the picture it looks like a glare but my daughter loved it.,45277,3
45278,I purchased a pair a few years ago in a local store for my husband.,45278,3
45278,He has since lost them so I purchased this pair online.,45278,3
45278,Husband doesn't wear them.,45278,3
45278,They rub the outer portion of his ear (the tip?).,45278,3
45278,"I looked online to see if I could buy a larger size but it comes in two sizes and I bought the ""regular"" which is the largest size.",45278,3
45278,Maybe this is not for adults?,45278,3
45279,I bought 4 pair and they all are a little small but ok.,45279,3
45280,This was smaller than expected.,45280,3
45280,"It also has no stretch or give in the fabric, something I really prefer for my grandbabies.",45280,3
45280,It's a nice little hoodie otherwise.,45280,3
45280,It's lightweight like a  t-shirt  so they can wear it in the house or on Spring days outside.,45280,3
45280,I recommend ordering a size up.,45280,3
45280,It shrunk a bit after washing as well.,45280,3
45282,The shirt itself is pretty.,45282,3
45282,I just do not like the material.,45282,3
45282,"It is very thin, see through thin and scratches my skin.",45282,3
45282,You could wear an undershirt but the sleeves would still be rough.,45282,3
45283,This is a nice bag and made with good material just alot larger than I intended it to be.,45283,3
45284,Dress fits but runs on the short side.,45284,3
45285,"I don't think this is the same dress in the photo, this material is of low quality, the stitching is poor and there are loose threads all over the place, the button holes are elastic string, I didn't know that before my purchase, my husband likes the ""look"" of the design.",45285,3
45286,made well too small and im normally a medium or small,45286,3
45287,It's very cute but chain broke within 30 mins.,45287,3
45288,"The item is too short and small, I love the fashion but I cannot use",45288,3
45289,Works with all my bathsuits,45289,3
45290,"Not great quality, but adequate in a pinch.",45290,3
45290,"Material is very thin and loose, but not like a ""scrunch"" style would be; it is just not sewn tightly enough to be effective, in my view.",45290,3
45290,"I would have returned them, but they came from overseas and the postage simply wasn't worth it for the price to me.",45290,3
45290,"But service was excellent - faaaar sooner than noted at the time of purchase - and I thank you for the great delivery, esp.",45290,3
45290,over the busy holiday season!,45290,3
45291,The product looked better in the picture and its a little too large.,45291,3
45291,but overall I'm happy with it.,45291,3
45292,Will keep it .Does not look as chic as the picture,45292,3
45293,"I did not realize this was a fake ring so I am returning it, based on what I saw it is good quality, I am just looking for the real thing.",45293,3
45294,"Material is stretchy and fitting, wished it was bigger!",45294,3
45294,Couldn't keep this top although I really wanted it.,45294,3
45295,"Not nreally permanent press, very wrinkled coming out of deyer",45295,3
45296,"Missing a stone, but a beautiful ring.",45296,3
45296,I plan on ordering another once my return has been processed.,45296,3
45298,I like the color and the buttons down the front.,45298,3
45298,The size ran big which is good to me because if I go to a regular store and get xxl they run small.,45298,3
45299,"Very comfortable, but didn't realize the bottom had elastic and balloons out a bit more than I would like.",45299,3
45300,Two of the stones fell out during shipment.,45300,3
45301,its okay its just the opened circles don't fit on my bum and i got the right size.,45301,3
45301,"It does raise your bum, makes it perky somewhat.",45301,3
45302,"Pros: prompt shipping, soft material, beautiful lace detail.",45302,3
45302,"Cons: sheer fabric, 3/4 sleeves, not true to size.",45302,3
45302,If you're taller than 5' this fits like a tunic style top.,45302,3
45302,"I'm 5'7"" and the bottom seam lays just below my tailbone.",45302,3
45303,"Nice necklace, but it had to go back.",45303,3
45303,The stones are much darker in person than online.,45303,3
45304,They're a little baggier than I expected and also shorter.,45304,3
45304,I'm 6'1 and they're like capri joggers on me.,45304,3
45304,Other than that it looks exactly like the picture.,45304,3
45305,Disappointed There was no beading crystals.,45305,3
45305,Plain sequins on the top part.,45305,3
45305,Corset on the bodice.,45305,3
45306,"The quality of the tux is quite good, especially considering the price .",45306,3
45306,The item was not available on Prime in the size needed so I had to order from the seller directly and it took around 8 days to be delivered .,45306,3
45306,I ordered my Bo's normal suit size 38 R .,45306,3
45306,The tuxedo itself fits ok except it looking a little long ( which I could forgive) and more like a regular fit.,45306,3
45306,But it does looks nice and not cheap at all.,45306,3
45306,"The pants though are a a different story and a complete disappointment: there are VERY slim fit , almost "" leggings "" like  .",45306,3
45306,Provided my man has skinny legs it looked quite awkward on him especially with the jacket put.,45306,3
45306,"Not sure if I would keep it : for the tux,
pants are a complete no go",45306,3
45307,"Chain is SUPER long, can't remove pendant from it to put on smaller chain.",45307,3
45307,"A lot of seeds inside, some had dislodged from the puffs, but most were intact.",45307,3
45307,"Globe appears to be well-constructed, but some glue was visible at top where silver seal is located.",45307,3
45307,"""Wish"" piece is difficult to keep facing forward, too.",45307,3
45307,"Overall, I like it a lot for design and this is a necklace I've wanted for a while.",45307,3
45307,"I wouldn't recommend this particular one, I'd say spend a little more for better quality and a chain that can be replaced if necessary.",45307,3
45308,"Top of bathing suit is somewhat large, made for endowed( large breasted) women but, manageable.",45308,3
45309,"Gorgeous dress, but way to short.",45309,3
45310,had to send back with no problem,45310,3
45311,I wear a 2X US .I bought a 4X I little small not much tho the top fits funny,45311,3
45312,"The top was too big but the bottoms were just right, although I personally felt like I was wearing a huge diaper so I didn't end up wearing the outfit.",45312,3
45312,It looked great on all of the other bridesmaids that wore it!,45312,3
45313,A little too large for an upper ear fit but it works.,45313,3
45314,"I like it, it's just ran a bit smaller than I thought.",45314,3
45315,The wallet is great don't get me wrong is small and fits my card perfectly and its a very durable wallet my thing with it is this its hard to fit more than one card in a slot (depending of the thickness of the card) without it not closing.,45315,3
45315,Also cash and loose change will not let it close either cast will not fit at all in the wallet.,45315,3
45315,But saying that if you only do cards really and don't have much this wallet is perfect for you,45315,3
45317,I assumed that the descriptive 1.3 inch cube was the size of the charm.,45317,3
45317,The charm is about 1/3 inch cube.,45317,3
45317,The item is nice just not what I expected.,45317,3
45317,The item description needs to be clearer.,45317,3
45318,Nice color & style but sized a bit small.,45318,3
45319,The dress is attractive but was way too small.,45319,3
45319,It was also very long as us the case with most dresses these days.,45319,3
45319,I did not re-order the dress mainly because it was not the material I expected,45319,3
45322,"Not my favorite, a little to much fabric in the chest",45322,3
45323,Don't like the look of the dress on me.,45323,3
45323,I am returning it.,45323,3
45323,It probably will fit another persons taste.,45323,3
45324,actually don't wear it as is rough on the finger.,45324,3
45325,"The fit is true to size...the problem I had with this, is that the material is REALLY see through!",45325,3
45325,"If you have a tank top or cami that you don't mind wearing underneath, then you're good, but it as so sheer that you're bra color, skin, and pretty much everything shows through, without something else.",45325,3
45325,"I bought the aqua one, and the color is nice...but the material wasn't what I expected.",45325,3
45326,Doesn't really look llke the picture,45326,3
45327,Size is a bit on the small side.,45327,3
45327,We returned one pair of N'Ice Caps gloves as they weren't waterproof and the lining didn't match up.,45327,3
45327,"Unfortunately looks to be the only brand readily available on Amazon, so took another punt.",45327,3
45327,"These are ok, the lining stayed put, though waterproof is a bit of an exaggeration.",45327,3
45328,"The shoe feels great, but the upper started falling apart right away.",45328,3
45328,"I have them held together with electrical tape in 4 different places, and I'm not exactly out running marathons in them, here.",45328,3
45328,"I'm determined to wear them all summer because they were so damn expensive but for the price, they really should have held up much better.",45328,3
45328,"I love vionic, nothing else works on my plantar fasciitis, but these were a disappointment.",45328,3
45329,Didn't fit had to return,45329,3
45330,Nice but I ordered 52mm and received a 55mm raybans.,45330,3
45330,Package is very good and has all accesories as described.,45330,3
45331,Color don't look like the picture I order the gray and i thought it was green.,45331,3
45331,"It's okay Im not crazy about it
Everyday work purse",45331,3
45332,"Just as I expected, however very tight between the toes.",45332,3
45333,"I really liked this shirt with the price, and was very excited but this shirt was definitely too small.",45333,3
45333,Order up a few sizes and you'll love it.,45333,3
45333,The shirt itself though was very cute!,45333,3
45333,And shipping did take awhile cause it comes from china.,45333,3
45334,the size was a bit small,45334,3
45335,"As another review notes, these did not arrive as pictured.",45335,3
45335,Instead I received a pair that look like some cringe-worthy white girl attempt at Mesoamerican appropriation.,45335,3
45335,"In addition, one dented almost immediately, and that's saying a lot as someone who is told repeatedly that she is too gentle with things.",45335,3
45335,"The dent doesn't inhibit wear, but it isn't very aesthetically appealing (much like the design).",45335,3
45335,"HOWEVER, these redeemed themselves a bit for me because they're so small.",45335,3
45335,"In my search for reliable nipple jewelry, my small chest and long hair haven't been kind.",45335,3
45335,"There's a lot of snagging, pulling, bleeding, you know.",45335,3
45335,"The jewelry posts are always, ALWAYS too long to wear comfortably.",45335,3
45335,But these are perfect!,45335,3
45335,"They fit like they were made for me and, regardless of design, I highly recommend them if you're looking for something reliable and small.",45335,3
45337,After reading the reviews I decided to order an extra large.,45337,3
45337,I wear a size 8 and it fit good.,45337,3
45337,"The top however is very padded so being a 34C, it definitely gave me some cleavage.",45337,3
45337,"Was a little snug on the leg openings, had to stretch it out a bit.",45337,3
45339,I just wish it was a tighter fit,45339,3
45340,This was great for the first week post partum... then (as other reviews stated) it became too large after the bloating reduced.,45340,3
45340,I believe it helped move the water weight out quicker but I have gotten to the point where it's as tight as it can go before ordering a smaller size.,45340,3
45340,"Also, the more stretched out it gets the less effective it is at keeping everything taught.",45340,3
45340,My belly is sagging through it since it is stretched out so much now.,45340,3
45340,"I am now ordering a smaller, much cheaper, higher rated waist-trainer for the rest of my post partum weight loss.",45340,3
45340,I ordered a small and it fit true to size based on my 8 mo.,45340,3
45340,"Lastly, this cannot be put on yourself... my husband has to help put it on every morning.",45340,3
45340,The Velcro design is not user-friendly.,45340,3
45340,I think there are better options out there for the money.,45340,3
45341,"not as full as I would have liked, but we'll made and you only have to worry about modesty on the top.",45341,3
45341,there's a short underskirt sewn in.,45341,3
45342,It's way too small.,45342,3
45342,"I ordered 2 sizes up (M) of my normal size (xs), still too small.",45342,3
45343,"Top runs small, the bottoms fit but the stitching is coming undone.",45343,3
45343,I decided to keep it since it was so cheap and just wear it in the backyard.,45343,3
45344,It's skin tight and nearly seethrough.,45344,3
45344,"I like it, but I'm unsure if I would wear it out in public.",45344,3
45344,I would order the black for a less revealing look.,45344,3
45345,Hat and handcuffs are kind of cheap but i like the whole outfit itself.,45345,3
45345,My boyfriend loves it.,45345,3
45345,Fits as expected but i am pretty small so that may not mean anything lol.,45345,3
45347,This is super cute but beware it is completely sheer!,45347,3
45347,I would wear it all the time if it wasn't see through!,45347,3
45347,guess I'll wear it for a swimsuit cover up,45347,3
45348,"Took a long time to get here, but when it did it was what I expected :)",45348,3
45349,"The tie seemed well made but was not any longer than my ""off-the-shelf"" standard ties.",45349,3
45349,"I don't understand how you call these ""long length"" ties!",45349,3
45350,"I bought 5, 1 for each of the familly and one got damagen in the cord in the first time used.",45350,3
45350,Its a good item.,45350,3
45351,Looks great but it's heavy due to the canvas.,45351,3
45351,I used it for a trip but I will mostly likely never use it again.,45351,3
45352,I normally wear a size 18 and this dress was a little loose but a good fit.,45352,3
45352,"The length is perfect, not too short.",45352,3
45352,The stockings however are super small and I could only get them up to mid thigh.,45352,3
45352,"Unfortunately, I feel like these complete the costume and I am unable to wear them.",45352,3
45352,Keep this in mind if you have thick thighs.,45352,3
45353,"They are sheer, and very tight around the ankles.",45353,3
45353,This only became a problem for me once my ankles started swelling during my last month of pregnancy.,45353,3
45353,"The tightness of the leggings drew attention to the puffiness, and may have made the swelling worse.",45353,3
45353,"So, better to wear these ones early on, before the puffiness sets in.",45353,3
45353,"Also, I find that this type of fabric doesn't stay up very well, and you spend all day hiking them up even if they fit well.",45353,3
45354,The make of the dress was a bit off the cross section in middle was twisted and was not fitting smoothly across the dress.,45354,3
45354,I was a little disappointed.,45354,3
45355,I can barely see the blue stones.,45355,3
45355,I am a bit disappointed but I didn't pay a lot for it so it's fine for now.,45355,3
45356,I like the shirt but it flares out quite a bit at the bottom.,45356,3
45356,Im going to have to alter it to wear it so that it doesn't look odd.,45356,3
45357,The tote is very very small.,45357,3
45357,Not big enough to fit a 11.5 inch lap top.,45357,3
45358,When I first put these on I was thrilled.,45358,3
45358,They are incredibly soft and comfortable and the mesh panels help keep things in place.,45358,3
45358,"After wearing them for a while, however, I was disappointed to discover that they ride up very badly.",45358,3
45358,Maybe it's because I have relatively slender thighs but they didn't work for me.,45358,3
45359,I expected a little more black.,45359,3
45359,It is pretty silver.,45359,3
45360,didn't give me the sparkle like other pieces that I have,45360,3
45362,product runs very small - exchanged for another item,45362,3
45363,I wear a sticky bra in nude/skin tone and I don't have many issues.,45363,3
45363,The fit is true to size and I love the color.,45363,3
45363,The back detail is so sexy and flirty.,45363,3
45364,The skirt is too small but will keep it since I'm on a weight reduction plan thats going well.,45364,3
45365,I like this one,45365,3
45367,It's a little too big and dowdy.,45367,3
45367,It doesn't fit well.,45367,3
45368,Fits great and is lightweight.,45368,3
45368,Unfortunately they only lastly one trip at the indoor water park.,45368,3
45368,A hole was starting to develop right at the end of the trip.,45368,3
45369,"Fairly loose, but pretty soft for an acrylic material.",45369,3
45369,"The red is definitely darker than the picture they show, more like a burgundy.",45369,3
45369,This is the red dress I was going to wear them with.,45369,3
45370,Oakley makes some great backpacks.,45370,3
45370,"First one i ordered was too small but photo was identical to the Kitchen Sink Backpack (which is why I ordered it), so I sent it back.",45370,3
45370,Then I ordered this one.,45370,3
45370,"The Lunch Box -pictured as shown, but the specs showed it was bigger.",45370,3
45370,"But when it arrived, it also was not as the photo depicted.",45370,3
45370,"Now I have to decide if I want to send this one back too, or give it as a gift.",45370,3
45370,Lesson here is - don't trust the photos!,45370,3
45370,But then how do you figure out what model you want to purchase?,45370,3
45371,Made of jersey which is nice.,45371,3
45371,"Will be wearable after washing, because it smells out of the pkg.",45371,3
45371,Sizing is off at least one size.,45371,3
45371,"I normally wear a 20 so I ordered a 3x hoping for loose.. No way, snug as heck.",45371,3
45371,I'm keeping it because I like the cape but will cut it off a few inches and wear it as a top with a black skirt.,45371,3
45371,Go 2 sizes up unless you are wanting to show every bump and curve.,45371,3
45372,But much smaller than I expected.,45372,3
45373,"I ordered the ""pink"" version of this dress, large size and I got rose red, size medium.",45373,3
45373,"It stretches so it fits, but it hugs my breasts too closely (40DD).",45373,3
45374,This dress was much too short and somewhat large.,45374,3
45374,It's also a little flimsy.,45374,3
45376,I definitely wouldn't call this hunter green.,45376,3
45376,It's most certainly lighter in color than the picture shown in the product description (see and compare to my photo below).,45376,3
45376,"I'm fairly certain they sent me a ""Kelly Green"" by mistake.",45376,3
45376,"I will keep it, because it will still work for my purpose plus I just don't have time for an exchange before I need to use it.",45376,3
45376,It's also smoother and shinier on one side than the other -- something that doesn't matter to me but you might want to be aware of.,45376,3
45377,I read reviews and many said would fit at the top if you're bigger.,45377,3
45377,"Almost no stretch, but he probably stay up if you're a size 2-8.",45377,3
45377,You get what you pay for.,45377,3
45378,"I wasn't completely satisfied, but I received a full refund and they let me keep the sweatshirt anyway!",45378,3
45378,Cant really complain with that,45378,3
45379,I can not to say much about this item.,45379,3
45379,Did not fits as expected.,45379,3
45381,2 sizes too small.,45381,3
45382,One size fits all is not a good description.,45382,3
45382,I am 5'2 and weigh about 138 and it is not loose fitting as shown in photo.,45382,3
45382,"It's nice, but not for my pudgy self.",45382,3
45383,Bought for my daughter.,45383,3
45383,Top fit okay but bottoms were way too small.,45383,3
45384,It is only too large because I overestimated my size!,45384,3
45386,Prey ...3 ave allen o wle wearng e o ar.,45386,3
45386,I w e one wa gger can' really ee .,45386,3
45386,Can' ea e prce.,45386,3
45386,I' glad I go e  won' y ore.,45386,3
45387,Neutral rating of 3.,45387,3
45388,Doesn't look like pictures,45388,3
45389,sizing on this skirt runs extremely small.,45389,3
45389,I ordered a large thinking it would accommodate up to a size 10.,45389,3
45389,I'm more an 8 but like my skirts that are full to be more loose.,45389,3
45389,this skirt is more like a size 6.,45389,3
45389,"I think the size chart should be changed, to avoid returns.",45389,3
45389,Keep in mind the style of the skirt is very cute.,45389,3
45389,"Also the order says ""With belt"" I did not receive a belt.",45389,3
45389,Hope this helps the company for the future.,45389,3
45390,"Super cute, but feels like if I wash it, it will completely lose it's shape.",45390,3
45391,The dress was ok but not as nice as the picture.,45391,3
45391,The zipper was nothing like in the picture and the fabric was fading after one use.,45391,3
45392,I really love this ring only problem is sizing is off.,45392,3
45393,hard to put on,45393,3
45394,Thought the crest was a patch but its a silk screen.,45394,3
45394,heavy and large polo.,45394,3
45395,"It feels cheap (for the price I can't complain too much)
The problem is, it barely fits my I phone, and it is only a I phone 5, so when I upgrade next year to a bigger phone, I will
need to purchase another case.",45395,3
45396,Im about 5'6 weigh 180 I ordered a large and its too small.,45396,3
45397,I love the design and the fabric is comfortable.,45397,3
45397,But I ordered an XL and it fits like a M - I could barely get it on and it's definitely not wearable at that size.,45397,3
45398,This was not meant for a busty person.,45398,3
45398,My only complaint is the bust area didn't cover.,45398,3
45399,"It was a little tight in the chest area, and it is a little long for some one like myself that is more short wasted.",45399,3
45399,"Other than those two issues, the product was everything that the picture indicated that it would be.",45399,3
45400,"Pretty dress, but it's too tight.",45400,3
45400,I wear a size 16.,45400,3
45400,I bought the 4X.,45400,3
45400,Was a perfect fit except the chest area.,45400,3
45400,I'm very busty though.,45400,3
45401,Im a size 8 and got a large.,45401,3
45401,The top is lined and runs a little small but looks nice-bottoms fit well but kinda see through:( i have to wear nude underwear under to stay discreet.,45401,3
45402,Too small and filmy.,45402,3
45402,Had to give it away.,45402,3
45403,"The design it very cute, but it is the thinnest bre I have ever worn... almost like wearing nylons.",45403,3
45404,"Runs large, it appeared to have more texture in the embroidory on the picture, instead just a flat print, very flimsy fabric, (forgive me for the misspelling).",45404,3
45405,this shirt ran pretty small.,45405,3
45405,i would say order a size up.,45405,3
45405,also the sleeves were pretty tight- even compared to the rest of the shirt.,45405,3
45406,"Too small, at least for me a 5'9 dude 128lbs,",45406,3
45409,"but didn't use too long time, some part cracked, peeling.",45409,3
45410,LOVE LOVE LOVE this ring !,45410,3
45411,Heavy runs big beautiful,45411,3
45412,Description said: 30% wool but it is actually 100% acrylic.,45412,3
45412,"I don't use 100% synthetic for my kids, so it is disappointing.",45412,3
45413,Quality was good I think.,45413,3
45413,Based on the chest measurements I ordered an XL which was totally stupid.,45413,3
45413,It was way way too large.,45413,3
45413,I think I needed a medium.,45413,3
45413,I wear an 8 or 10 depending on brand.,45413,3
45413,My bra size is 38D for reference.,45413,3
45413,Not totally sure if a Medium will work so I am just returning for a refund.,45413,3
45414,WAY TO SMALL tiny people must be making and determining the sizes and they are way wrong!,45414,3
45415,different cloth and to small....prettyprint,45415,3
45417,"It's a little see through, but cute.",45417,3
45418,it fit well when I got it but shrunk a little after a few washings.,45418,3
45418,I didn't hand wash cold and lay out to dry so that may have helped prevent that.,45418,3
45418,"I was going this shirt to work out in, but I like my exercise shirts long, so it's a night night shirt now.",45418,3
45419,"The bottoms fit great, but a button immediately fell off.",45419,3
45419,The top is extremely small and would not even fit a child over 9 years old.,45419,3
45420,These leggings came with 2 tiny holes....super disappointing!,45420,3
45421,My baby is a bit big so I ordered up and so this onesie fit really nice.,45421,3
45421,The only thing is that the word is squished too low so you can't really see it.,45421,3
45422,Band is not very durable.,45422,3
45422,Wore it for a week and it already started to rip.,45422,3
45423,"Cute dress ,cheaply made.",45423,3
45423,Wanted to return but lost receipt that came with it.,45423,3
45424,Beautiful but too large for my wrist,45424,3
45425,Pretty print and great material.,45425,3
45425,It's a great but.,45425,3
45426,"the color, quality and pattern was nice but unfortunately it was too small for me.",45426,3
45428,This hat is really big and made of thin material.,45428,3
45429,Not what I expected.,45429,3
45430,Much smaller than I anticipated it's smaller than a dime when I opened it i was shocked of size but its a very pretty piece.,45430,3
45430,I've read some of the comments you need to put it up to the light in order to glow it's pretty self explanatory.,45430,3
45431,It's a sexy style bikini but the top is super small.,45431,3
45431,I cannot wear this.,45431,3
45433,I need to exchange for smaller size.,45433,3
45434,"It fit as expected, however the material is quite itchy for some reason.",45434,3
45434,The leggings really stick to my legs and I am constantly having to pull at them to get rid of the static/itch.,45434,3
45434,They do not have a yoga pant feel.,45434,3
45435,They are like spanx.,45435,3
45436,"The design is fun, but the socks are very thin.",45436,3
45436,"From the photo, I thought they looked more cushiony and substantial.",45436,3
45436,i've decided not to give them as a gift as i had planned.,45436,3
45437,Beautiful but not what I expected.,45437,3
45437,It indicated leather but it was vinyl.,45437,3
45437,I want to return it.,45437,3
45438,This runs extremely small.,45438,3
45439,Well priced organic undies!,45439,3
45439,"These were great when they first arrived, but after one wash they shrank considerably, from a 6-7yo, to more like a 4-5yo size.",45439,3
45439,"Thats fine because my son is 5, but imagine if I had an actual 7yo :\  I was hoping to get several months of wear for my kid, but will have to keep shopping now.",45439,3
45440,It's ok...This is now what I expected and it is way too revealing.,45440,3
45440,Also I am a size B and the Medium didn't fit me,45440,3
45442,"Fabric, fit and finish are great.",45442,3
45442,"The front pockets are not deep enough; every time you sit down, something falls out.",45442,3
45442,"Rear pockets are fine, in fact they could be less deep and still work satisfactorily.",45442,3
45443,Great product but our chain broke the 2nd day we had it.,45443,3
45444,Smells like it has been in a machine shop.,45444,3
45445,"Okay, but not great.",45445,3
45445,"Rather cheap looking for an adult, but probably good for a child's costume.",45445,3
45445,"For $2 more I found a much heavier and real-looking strand of faux pearls at Gordman's - after I received this, of course.",45445,3
45445,I'll give this item to a neighbor for her niece to play with.,45445,3
45446,I only wore it for 2 months.,45446,3
45446,It bunches up a lot and cuts into the skin.,45446,3
45447,Awkward to put on but great color.,45447,3
45447,I might alter the neck a bit.,45447,3
45448,Not as cute in person,45448,3
45449,Runs smaller than anticipated,45449,3
45450,"good material weight small size, usually I use 7 and this was adjusted me",45450,3
45451,Was really pretty but the clasp came off really easily,45451,3
45452,Little tight felt more like 2x,45452,3
45453,"This was the third pair we got and although the first two held up for 6 months a piece, one of the new shoes ripped in two days.",45453,3
45453,One is fine and the other has holes.,45453,3
45453,I am guessing a bad a lot but disappointing since the quality had bee fine.,45453,3
45454,It's made with bamboo or chopstick like material and the ribbon is tough.,45454,3
45455,"This was pretty, but to small for me.",45455,3
45455,"Im a size 7 in pants and I've got a larger than average butt, so this didn't fit me.",45455,3
45456,Very nice but runs small,45456,3
45457,I love the case!,45457,3
45457,I noticed a few small hair like fibers in the liquid though that looked a little weird and it just barely fit my iPhone 6S.,45457,3
45457,Very cute but made for looks only.,45457,3
45457,No protective qualities at all.,45457,3
45458,"Cute, good quality shirt, but arrived with a hole in it.",45458,3
45458,"It is on a hem, so I can sew it.",45458,3
45458,It is annoying though to have to do this.,45458,3
45458,"I would expect this with a used item, not a new one.",45458,3
45459,Looks legit from far away.,45459,3
45459,The stones look pretty fake once you get close.,45459,3
45460,So these definitely run large - my daughter is now in 18 month clothes and they are just starting to fit.,45460,3
45460,"The band across the top sort of keeps them on, however somehow she manages to pull the toe part of the sock off leaving the rubber band and still wrapped around her ankle and then gets really upset that they don't come off the rest of the way.",45460,3
45460,"They are also a bit thick, so now that she is in shoes they don't fit terribly well because the extra fabric bunches up.",45460,3
45460,"The anti-slip pads have stayed in place for many washing though, which is more than I can say for some of the other brands out there.",45460,3
45460,Overall they are holding up well.,45460,3
45461,"It's duable for what I need I for, don't like the material",45461,3
45462,I'm 5'5 125 36B.,45462,3
45462,Top was a little too big (which I could fix with a few stitches) but the bottoms were extremely too small.,45462,3
45462,Get what you pay for.,45462,3
45463,But a little smaller then expected,45463,3
45464,It was at least a size too small.,45464,3
45464,Fabric and colors are what I expected.,45464,3
45465,The fleece inside makes them quite warm and great for staying warm in the winter.,45465,3
45465,The fabric pills after washing and they aren't as a stretchy as I would like but otherwise a great pair of leggings,45465,3
45466,Nice price n looks.,45466,3
45466,But it bigger than you want,45466,3
45467,2nd pair I've purchased.,45467,3
45468,I love the product wish i could get it sized to fit me though,45468,3
45470,Well it's a bridesmaid dress.,45470,3
45470,So u go with what the brid3 wants..overall I guess it works..I wear a 2-4 in dresses usually but a 4-6 in pants.. since it's a mermaid still I a went with a 6.,45470,3
45470,Which fit fine in hips but slight loss in top.,45470,3
45470,The background in chest area is not white but the royal blue with sequins and beads sewn on top.,45470,3
45470,The shoulder is this off white mesh type material :(.,45470,3
45470,The bow sits off which I'm gonna have to pin in place or something.,45470,3
45470,Also I'm 5'8 and dress hits the floor  with train in flats I will be fine.,45470,3
45470,The bride loves it.,45470,3
45471,"Love the dress, however, I was hoping that the bottom half would flow out more.",45471,3
45471,I have wide hips and a large backside and the end of this dress hugs my hips,45471,3
45472,Ok but it bent when trying to put on shoe,45472,3
45473,Larger than I thought,45473,3
45474,Thin but great for my use with long tunic,45474,3
45475,Product is of good quality but sizing was very inconsistent.,45475,3
45475,I ordered a different color but same size as a friend ordered from the same vendor and mine was huge so I had to return the product.,45475,3
45476,"The size is way, way, too small.",45476,3
45476,If you are a med then order a XXL.,45476,3
45476,The quality seemed good but I returned it because its just too small.,45476,3
45477,These are cut for someone with a fuller backside and thighs.,45477,3
45477,"I am more dumpling shaped than pear, so they bag a bit.",45477,3
45477,"That being said, the cotton seems to be of a good quality, no shrinkage after the first wash and dry.",45477,3
45477,They do have a lot of seams.,45477,3
45478,"The dress looks really cute on the hanger and on the model, but when I put it on, the skirt flared out like there was a bunch of tulle underneath.",45478,3
45478,The scalloped edges don't lie flat on your back.,45478,3
45478,The fabric is super thick; it feels like wet-suit material.,45478,3
45478,"Customer service was quick and nice; I was ultimately going to return the dress, but I would have lost money because I had to pay for shipping back.",45478,3
45478,"I was given a 15% refund for keeping the dress, but I don't think I'll ever wear it.",45478,3
45479,"5'4 /152lbs/34C Overall the cover up fits well, I ordered the green & blue material isn't as flowing as pictured, I do not like the black lace on the bottom of the green cover-up which is not pictured or added in the description it looks cheap, will probably remove it.",45479,3
45479,"The blue cover-up came as pictured it's pretty fits well, no complaints",45479,3
45480,It oddly wasn't the same fit/sizing as a Burt's Bees footed coveralls that I had purchased from buybuybaby.,45480,3
45480,"Not sure why, but its shorter and wider.",45480,3
45481,Material is very soft and design is pretty on front - back totally plain.,45481,3
45481,It did ship quickly.,45481,3
45481,Can't beat the price.,45481,3
45482,Quality seems very good fit right from length but it was so wide had to get a refund.,45482,3
45482,I had ordered 2 pairs for both of my girls,45482,3
45483,Have one in cream color which fits better.,45483,3
45485,Not the same color as the picture and runs small.,45485,3
45486,This shirt came up to high on the neck for me.,45486,3
45487,I bought this for my three year old but it fit my 18 month old a little better.,45487,3
45487,The length is short and the slippers run a little small.,45487,3
45488,Nothing special about these.,45488,3
45488,"Fit is okay, they are just okay.",45488,3
45488,Colors are fun but....,45488,3
45489,Runs a size smaller.,45489,3
45489,If you order this item then order a size or two larger than you wear.,45489,3
45490,Started to tear first time skiing.,45490,3
45490,"However, they kept my hands nice n warm.",45490,3
45491,It was difficult to eat,45491,3
45492,"Too small, usually where medium and traded for a large and still too small",45492,3
45493,Pretty colors but cheaply made in China.,45493,3
45493,"""Cashmere feel"" tag right on front of scarf.",45493,3
45493,Edges not sewn looks like it will start to fray quick.,45493,3
45495,Lots of compliments but super huge and leaves a mark on your hand.,45495,3
45495,"For the price, go for it.",45495,3
45497,Pretty and good deal but broke quickly.,45497,3
45497,I did get a few wears out of them though.,45497,3
45498,Cute but not as protective as you may think.,45498,3
45498,It doesn't go that far up to the screen of the phone.,45498,3
45499,"Good purse, the only thing is that the button that connect my purse is coming off.",45499,3
45500,It runs true size.,45500,3
45501,"I loved it while it lasted, but the rose fell off after a few weeks.",45501,3
45503,I bought 2 of these.,45503,3
45503,One in the beige floral lace and another in the navy floral.,45503,3
45503,Beige arrived quickly (prime) and was as expected.,45503,3
45503,"I got a medium and glad I did (I'm 5'5"" 125) I think the small would have been too tight on the shoulders.",45503,3
45503,The Navy however arrived at a different time and smelled awful like chemicals.,45503,3
45503,It was cheap so I'm going to keep it but I could not believe how horrible it smelled.,45503,3
45504,These were a good buy (I got them way on sale).,45504,3
45504,Some cosmetic defects around the seams but for the most part they have held up and are quite comfortable.,45504,3
45505,not what I expected,45505,3
45507,It has a nice shape and is adjustable but the colors are off and not like the photo at all.,45507,3
45507,"If you are looking for this to compliment your Marpat gear, try something else.",45507,3
45508,Leggings didn't hold up very well.,45508,3
45508,Will go with another brand next time.,45508,3
45509,A little too short for me.,45509,3
45509,But with a long camisole underneath it's fine,45509,3
45510,so i read the customer reviews and decided to order a size up.,45510,3
45510,I am a 34B and the medium top fits me perfect.,45510,3
45510,the problem is I do have a booty and hips and the medium bottoms squeeze the skin and make me look like im super pudgy on the sides.,45510,3
45510,I mean its fine but just remember to size up,45510,3
45511,"Good fit, got a lot cheers.",45511,3
45511,Just have to be careful of the loose wires inside the sweater.,45511,3
45511,Very easy to accidentally pull a bulb out.,45511,3
45512,sizes are not right,45512,3
45513,to large for a child,45513,3
45514,fabric isn't very good quality- it is quite rough and itchy.,45514,3
45514,"I was expecting a light, soft cotton blend.",45514,3
45515,"The dress seemed well made, but it was sooooooo large.",45515,3
45515,I usually wear a Medium and I ordered a Small knowing it would be flowy.,45515,3
45515,Even an extra small wouldn't have worked.,45515,3
45515,Had to return :(,45515,3
45516,Sandals are good quality but they run entirely too small.,45516,3
45517,Pretty but runs small.,45517,3
45517,Fabric is light weight so not winter appropriate.,45517,3
45518,Cute ..Runs small and is shorter than expected.,45518,3
45518,Took awhile to receive it..actually forgot I ordered it when it arrived !,45518,3
45519,But I was expecting a muff that was expandable.,45519,3
45519,But this is fixed.,45519,3
45519,But not as much fleece as I thought there would be.,45519,3
45520,I bought size 6-8 for my 1 year old who wears a size 4 toddler but they are big enough to fit my 7 year old who wears a size one in boys.,45520,3
45520,I can even stretch them to fit me and I wear a woman's 8.,45520,3
45520,These are NOT toddler socks.,45520,3
45520,Other than the size issue the socks are nice and thin.,45520,3
45520,Perfect for summer or dress shoes.,45520,3
45521,The feet on these were smaller than normal pajamas of this style that we buy.,45521,3
45521,The feet also got holes in them really really quickly.,45521,3
45521,"Its too bad, because I love the purple dino print.",45521,3
45521,Its so hard to find dinosaur stuff in girly colors.,45521,3
45522,"I do have to pull them up quite a bit, and the material feels cheap.",45522,3
45522,"Plus it's not black the way it's describes; more like a dark, dull gray.",45522,3
45522,"It's still very cute, though!",45522,3
45523,fits small for the size.,45523,3
45525,It broke after 3 months and I'm sad about it.,45525,3
45525,It looks pretty and everything but it was slightly cheap so the red charm broke.,45525,3
45526,"However,  the wig is a lot thinner than pictured, not add many curls either.",45526,3
45526,"Plus the bangs are super long, almost as long as my normal hair.",45526,3
45526,"I have been wearing wigs for years,  and am slightly disappointed with this one.",45526,3
45526,"However, it doesn't have the fake looking shine that truly low quality wigs have.",45526,3
45526,At least it will hold up through halloween for my Cheshire cat costume.,45526,3
45528,"Material very cheap
Sweater had many loose threads",45528,3
45529,The way the lace is just raw cut around the neckline looks cheap.,45529,3
45530,Good looking but lacks the quality I was looking for.,45530,3
45531,Very cute but will have to let grandbaby grow into them.,45531,3
45532,Ran very small even though I ordered larger expected that.,45532,3
45532,I was just ok made very cheaply.,45532,3
45533,"Costume was excellent, but it was missing the scarf and belt, i need it for a play and it was to late to send back for replacement because then I wouldn't get it back in time for a play.",45533,3
45534,My son loved it - except it was too tight for his head.,45534,3
45534,He wears a men's medium in clothing.,45534,3
45535,"Cool design, shirt way too large for my four year old after multiple washes and runs through the drier.",45535,3
45535,"It is large even on my 6 year old, but it wasn't for him.",45535,3
45536,color was not as pictured.,45536,3
45537,Beautiful Material but kind of deceiving.,45537,3
45537,The panties are more like Granny underwear and it's more for a size 6 or 8 Woman.,45537,3
45537,"I'm smaller than that so I swim in it, literally.",45537,3
45537,"Can't sweat it, for the price though!",45537,3
45539,"Did not realize the back was open, will have to sew a partial seam.",45539,3
45540,Scarf is very small and did not come with key ring.,45540,3
45541,Bought these for a Mavis costume.,45541,3
45541,"I am 5'6 and 245 lbs and I am able to get them on and wear them, they are just a little uncomfortable in the crotch area.",45541,3
45541,It took a lot of work to get them up all the way.,45541,3
45541,I do have large thighs though.,45541,3
45541,"I feel weird writing this, but this is the information I look for as a larger woman.",45541,3
45542,you should get a size smaller than you normally wear so it will feel snug like a swimsuit should and not floppy and loose.,45542,3
45542,I didn't care for the sarong bit in the front looked out of place.,45542,3
45542,Also if you order wrong size you have to pay to ship it back so your paying about $8 just to try it on.,45542,3
45542,I am returning mine and would have ordered a smaller one but won't risk another $8.00.,45542,3
45543,"The material was not as expected, but still makes it a  fun sexy shirt.",45543,3
45544,"The measurements provided are inaccurate and the dress is too small in the bust and shoulders, but I ordered the largest size and can still wear it comfortably with a few buttons undone at the top.",45544,3
45544,The cut of the dress is very cute and flattering and I received 3 different compliments on the dress the first day I wore it to work.,45544,3
45544,"However, the dress came with only a tag saying ""XL""--no brand name, listing of what the fabric is, or care instructions.",45544,3
45544,"The product description says, ""Material :cotton blend,soft,stretch,"" but there is no stretch to the fabric at all and it feels like a rough unwashed linen or possibly even a potato sack.",45544,3
45544,Washing it once in a delicates bag and hanging it to dry did not make the fabric any softer.,45544,3
45544,There are also a bunch of loose threads that I had to chop off.,45544,3
45544,"That said, I decided to keep the dress as I have not seen another with quite the same cut or that will fit over my frame (currently 98cm, 94 cm, 104cm, shoulders 37cm) - usually US size 10 in tops and 12-14 in bottoms.",45544,3
45544,The length of the dress varies; I like to wear the dress with leggings shorts underneath for modesty at work as it falls mid thigh (I'm 5'7).,45544,3
45544,A great thing about the dress is that it can also be worn just as a button shirt as it unbuttons all the way down.,45544,3
45544,If you are OK with the fabric but worried about sizing around the bust and shoulders the dress can be worn open as a shirt.,45544,3
45545,I wrote to shipper on a possible error and was holding off writing a review.,45545,3
45545,"Since I have not received any feedback,  here are my comments.",45545,3
45545,I asked numerous times regarding the QTY I would be getting.,45545,3
45545,"There is a comment in the description what one is getting  ""BONUS 6 FUN LUGGAGE ID TAGES INCLUDE""  My inquires were posted,  based on this,  is one getting  4  + 6  ID  tags.",45545,3
45545,"Received back Yes,  then I would expect to get 10  ID  tags and not 4.",45545,3
45545,"I received only 4

Is the item one that fits my needs.",45545,3
45545,However the lack of getting the other 6 ID tags is a disappointment.,45545,3
45545,"So,  be aware,  when buying this.",45545,3
45547,"It was cute, but I ended up returning it because the material seemed a bit cheap.",45547,3
45547,"I read another review that said it was light ""t-shirt material.""",45547,3
45547,I didn't quite understand what that meant until I saw it in person.,45547,3
45548,The material is a little costumey to me but it's cute.,45548,3
45548,"Runs a little small on my bottom half, fits good up top",45548,3
45549,"This runs very, very, very  small!",45549,3
45549,You better order a few sizes up from your actual size.,45549,3
45549,The red is almost a burgundy.,45549,3
45549,It is pretty and came with the rest of my order is less then a week.,45549,3
45550,Gotten compliments on this!,45550,3
45551,"I can't say I didn't cause this, but one of the hinges has broken.",45551,3
45551,Seems like a weak area.,45551,3
45551,Don't know if there are better options but I won't buy these again.,45551,3
45551,Nicely made glasses make it so I can read the radio display and gauges while driving and still have a clear view of the road.,45551,3
45552,Somewhat small but manageable.,45552,3
45553,Heavy polyester feel and don't buy if you have cats or care about lint.,45553,3
45553,"Still, great for winter work outs or as pajama alternatives.",45553,3
45554,Good but not shine just on the photo,45554,3
45556,Good quality just made a little on the small side.,45556,3
45557,I'm 5'7 and aprox 120 something pounds.,45557,3
45557,"First of all the socks are made of a good stretchy material, but for me when I wore them they would not stay secure on my thighs.",45557,3
45557,They were loose and would keep falling down to about my knees.,45557,3
45557,The good thing is that I had a garter belt so that helps them stay up.,45557,3
45557,"Maybe I'm a little skinny and that's the reason why that is happening, but I'm not sure.",45557,3
45557,If they fit a little better I would have been more satisfied.,45557,3
45557,"But it was pretty cheap and works with the garter belt, excited to wear them still.",45557,3
45558,This is an ok product.,45558,3
45558,Color is not the actual US blue.,45558,3
45559,It wasn't nearly as full as pictured but it worked.,45559,3
45560,The stones are falling out,45560,3
45561,The bottom fit well.,45561,3
45561,Unfortunately the top was much too small for me.,45561,3
45561,"Looks great, just wished it fit.",45561,3
45562,I waited over a month to receive this beanie and was disappointed when it came in.,45562,3
45562,"The braided band across the front is, in fact, glued on and looks pretty cheap.",45562,3
45562,I washed it before wearing and laid flat to dry.,45562,3
45562,It shrunk as it dried and needed some work to get the slouched look back.,45562,3
45562,It's okay and I'm keeping it because it's too much hassle to send it back overseas.,45562,3
45563,Torso length runs tight.,45563,3
45564,A bit tight across the back but VERY cute.,45564,3
45564,Just keep in mind when ordering your size.,45564,3
45565,The sandals were a bit larger than expected.,45565,3
45565,My grandbaby won't be able to wear them until she is much older.,45565,3
45566,"Im tiny, but my bosom is slightly curvy, so I thought the fit might be somewhat small, but not THIS small.",45566,3
45566,To fit into the bottom part of this swimsuit in S size you gotta be Kate Moss after 3 months of starvation.,45566,3
45567,Wrinkled and not as pretty as the photo; looks rather cheap but I do like that it is lightweight.,45567,3
45568,Large chests probably won't look as cute like mine.,45568,3
45568,Not ment for a bra but DDs need bras!,45568,3
45569,"Very cute and comfortable, but this dress is made of a variety of fabrics (jersey, stretch lace, rayon/spandex blend) and when washed it shrank.",45569,3
45569,There are no care instructions.,45569,3
45569,"So, this is one of my child's favorite dresses but not  mine.",45569,3
45570,"The shirt and tie it self is still nice, but the tie is not the exact same as pictured that's the whole reason for me buying it this is completely different, that's why I'm only giving three stars!",45570,3
45571,"I bought a medium, it was a little big so in returned it and bought a small still big, feels like it fits the same as the medium.",45571,3
45571,"Cute dress and length us good so I'm going to get it altered to fit better, great price can't pass it up.",45571,3
45573,Wonderful coverage for leather dye.,45573,3
45573,"High quality, but the cordovan color is VERY dark and almost black.",45573,3
45573,My shoes were reddish maroon cordovan and the same color as off-the shelf wax cordovan polish.,45573,3
45573,This dye was not what I expected.,45573,3
45573,The resolene product from Fiebing is excellent and expected this dye to be perfect.,45573,3
45573,"Box and bottle are printed ""Cordovan"".",45573,3
45574,This shirt was to be a gift and it was embarrassing to give.,45574,3
45574,"The weight of the shirt was not impressive, but worse, the inking was sloppy and there were visible smudges on the left sleeve.",45574,3
45574,"Because the shirt arrived the day it was to be given, it had to be given as it was, but if time had permitted, it would have been returned.",45574,3
45574,Three stars only because the shipping was remarkably swift.,45574,3
45575,"I'm a size 4, 5'3"" and 130lbs.",45575,3
45575,They advertise that this will fit up to a size 12.,45575,3
45575,"That is simply not true, unless a size 12 wants a skin-tight shirt.",45575,3
45575,I had a little room in this shirt but not much and it did not go long enough to even cover my butt properly.,45575,3
45575,"This is a shirt, not a proper cover-up.",45575,3
45576,"It's very cute, but the underwire and bra cups are oddly placed, resulting in an poor fit at the top.",45576,3
45576,"I kept it, but wouldn't particularly recommend it because of this.",45576,3
45578,Way to small in the hips.,45578,3
45580,"It fit as expected and looks/feels good, BUT one of the black balls on the end of the straps came off the FIRST day.",45580,3
45580,So perhaps not the best overall quality.,45580,3
45581,"I didn't like the cloth, it's somewhat transparent",45581,3
45582,boot is molded to a curve on the sole which is hard to get the foot past/  boots one to two sizes too small,45582,3
45583,The product is great but runs small.,45583,3
45584,"While this looks great on my 4'11"" daughter, it is too short - unless she is standing still.",45584,3
45584,If she moves at all it exposes her.,45584,3
45584,Another few inches and it would be perfect.,45584,3
45584,I suggest using this as a tunic top with leggings.,45584,3
45584,"On the plus side, it's super cute!",45584,3
45586,I like the looks of the product and the quality.,45586,3
45586,The opening at the top is too small to insert books for my use.,45586,3
45587,"Will be
Returned  for a med size, if I can find how to.",45587,3
45587,"There's  no return slip or information  with items, bot items were too small.",45587,3
45588,the size is ok,45588,3
45589,The top is great and so is the material.,45589,3
45589,It is made for someone with very large hips.,45589,3
45589,I can wear it but needed to add a belt because it is that flowy.,45589,3
45590,It was much too large for handbags I normally carry - nice looking - just too large.,45590,3
45591,This is an alright top for the price but I would not get it again.,45591,3
45591,"If the material were nicer and heavier so that it hung closer to my waist, it would be more flattering.",45591,3
45591,Instead it's a soft but slightly itchy cheap cotton that is very lightweight and instead of creating baggy folds that taper and highlight my petite form it holds its shape and gapes awkwardly.,45591,3
45591,They may as well have made this one size because if you look at the size chart there is only a cm difference between sizes.,45591,3
45591,I ordered the x-large because I usually wear a 34B and I wanted the look in the photos: baggy with full length sleeves.,45591,3
45591,"I wish I'd gone with the medium because it's much too roomy around my 25"" waist.",45591,3
45591,"Baggy, sure, but because this is lightweight cotton and not something heavier or conforming like nylon/spandex, it holds it's shape and just gapes awkwardly around my entire waist.",45591,3
45591,it doesn't fold and cling and look sexy or highlight my petite waist.,45591,3
45591,I also thought it was going to be grey and white and it kind of is but it's more of a heather grey-blue that I'm not fond of.,45591,3
45591,"Finally, it's not as long in the back as the pictures make it out to be.",45591,3
45591,It almost looks like it's longer in the back but in truth it's cut straight across and leaves as much of the back exposed as it does the front.,45591,3
45591,I don't know what shirt the model is wearing but mine shows about half my back and again because it's a light cotton material it billows and holds it's shape so I have a big gap back there.,45591,3
45591,I do like the long sleeves but they are not fitted to the wrist as they appear in the photos.,45591,3
45591,They are loose and open.,45591,3
45592,I love the design.,45592,3
45592,When I first ordered the necklace the chain was broken.,45592,3
45592,"However, the return went very well.",45592,3
45592,The metal does rust easily though.,45592,3
45593,its ok not the best quality,45593,3
45595,"I love the material, but it is a little bit long!",45595,3
45596,"I thought the design of this dress was cute, and because it's unlike anything else I own, I thought I'd give it a try.",45596,3
45596,"I ordered the Medium size based on the measurement chart, and while the dress did fit well, the skirt material was just not soft enough to lay nicely.",45596,3
45596,"It was so puffy in the back, I felt like I was wearing a bustle!",45596,3
45596,"Needless to say, I didn't think a poofy behind was very becoming, so I returned the dress.",45596,3
45596,"If the design could be improved, I'd recommend the following:
1) Solid and patterned ""shirts"" (not everyone looks good in stripes)
2) Softer material for the ""skirt""",45596,3
45597,It isn't as flattering as I thought it would be.,45597,3
45597,"The neckline is too high, and it looks cheaply made up close.",45597,3
45598,Measurements were much smaller than said.,45598,3
45598,Really cute but had to give it away because of the fit.,45598,3
45599,"After a month of diong 60 miles a week, I still have a hard time clipping it",45599,3
45600,The logo was a bit smaller than the tshirt shown.,45600,3
45600,I ordered and XL and it fit more like a L.,45600,3
45601,It looked like great material and that it would work but it was too big so I went back and bought my original one from waist gang society.,45601,3
45601,More expensive but at least I knew what size fit best for me,45601,3
45602,"Runs a little short, but I'm 5'8 and have a longer torso.",45602,3
45603,"very tight, gives me a headache...",45603,3
45604,"It's a nice shirt, loved it when I first got it.",45604,3
45604,The fabric changed though?,45604,3
45604,It went from soft/silky to kinda ruff after a few washes.,45604,3
45605,It looks cool but it's too big for noses.,45605,3
45605,It droops down too much so I have to end up pushing it further into my nose.,45605,3
45605,And it's a little lopsided.,45605,3
45606,"I first bought a sz 20, waaaaaay too big, then got 18, still too big, but I am keeping it as I love the look, and the fabric.",45606,3
45606,The main problem are the arm holes are huge.,45606,3
45606,Too big to be able to dart as it destroys the line.,45606,3
45606,so using with a colorful camisole top underneath.,45606,3
45607,Fits too small even for a small,45607,3
45608,"Small in the chest, and the back seam has already unraveled.",45608,3
45608,I would like this more if it were cotton.,45608,3
45609,Not very happy with purchase.,45609,3
45609,Would have liked different colors and or designs.,45609,3
45609,Looks like all of the sets are the same.,45609,3
45609,I am going to be ordering more but I will be looking at the advertisement closely before ordering.,45609,3
45610,I just got the dress this morning but I didn't really like it.,45610,3
45610,"I'm 5'5 and I weight around 115-120lbs, so I got a medium because the reviews said it came in small (i'm usually a size small).",45610,3
45610,"Even though I went a size up the skirt fit a bit loose, yet the top was pretty tight.",45610,3
45610,I was planning on wearing this to a school dance but I'm not going to after all because it doesn't fit.,45610,3
45610,"Also the top is not like the one in the picture, the top's top-half (idk if that makes sense lol) is actually a bit see through.",45610,3
45610,Overall the top fits tight and its very small.,45610,3
45610,"Although both pieces are nicely made and somewhat thick material, I didn't like the sizing because the top barely fit and well the skirt was loose.",45610,3
45610,"Wish it would've fit, I think I'm going to return it and look for a different dress.",45610,3
45611,Like it but too hard to get cards out of middle,45611,3
45612,I may come back and upgrade this review.,45612,3
45612,"For right now, I will just say that they are o.k.",45612,3
45612,My biggest problem with all of the dresses/skirts that I have purchased lately is that they don't match the material at the seam.,45612,3
45612,I guess that is because they are cheap.,45612,3
45612,I am not sure.,45612,3
45613,Great socks but they run way small,45613,3
45614,I wanted a somewhat loose fit but that's hard to do in this brand.,45614,3
45614,I ordered too big.,45614,3
45614,I would have ordered a size down if I knew it was AA.,45614,3
45615,Good beginner tap shoe.,45615,3
45615,Purchased for summer dance camp and worked great for our daughter.,45615,3
45615,As described in listing and fit as expected based on sizing chart.,45615,3
45616,fits but the make is not the best.,45616,3
45616,too much excess flair on the sheer part like fairy tail wedding dress style,45616,3
45617,Cute but flimsy and a bit smaller than it looks!!!!,45617,3
45618,Watch is very nice and my 2nd one..1st was a leather band and was great.,45618,3
45618,"The wire mesh band however is hard to tighten, no flexible slack and can be tricky.",45618,3
45619,"The front doesn't nearly come together as it should, but it is very pretty.",45619,3
45620,The key ring metal material began to peel.,45620,3
45621,Unfortunately too small so my baby could never wear them :(,45621,3
45622,"Digging feeling and can not wear pass 3hrs and I wear many types of vest, down to Orchard Corset corsets and this is not too comfortable.",45622,3
45622,"I miss this with Sweet Sweat Coconut and I SWEAT!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Sweat-Coconut-Workout-Enhancer-Gel-Made-with-Extra-Virgin-Organic-Coconut-Oil-XL-Jar-13-5oz/dp/B00Q5CIL4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Sweat Coconut 'Workout Enhancer' Gel - Made with Extra Virgin Organic Coconut Oil; 'XL' Jar 13.5oz.</a>",45622,3
45623,Not very pleased with it.,45623,3
45623,Very thin & see through.,45623,3
45623,Lack of colors in sizes needed.,45623,3
45623,Chose Beige but order got changed to peach because beige was out.,45623,3
45624,"Really great t-shirt; however, the size is way to small.",45624,3
45624,I'm so sad I won't be able to wear this.,45624,3
45625,I purchased this hoodie for my sister for her birthday.,45625,3
45625,She loves it and says it's comfortable and warm.,45625,3
45625,But after wearing it one time the pocket stitching came apart.,45625,3
45625,She sewed it up herself and it's holding fine now but just be aware that the stitching may be very weak.,45625,3
45626,Cute back pack but the zipper was broken.,45626,3
45626,My daughter was heart broken!,45626,3
45627,nice jacket exactly what I was looking for but was too small!,45627,3
45628,The main clasp came unglued almost immediately.,45628,3
45628,Not sure why it wasn't stitched.,45628,3
45628,Smells like leather a nice size.,45628,3
45628,I think it would be a great winter purse.,45628,3
45629,The size chart that was suggested wasn't accurate.. Too big.,45629,3
45631,My son loves them but some of the LED are already flickering out of sequence.,45631,3
45632,This ring is really beautiful but it is so big it looks like an egg sitting on your hand.,45632,3
45632,Slightly smaller would be so much nicer.,45632,3
45633,IT IS VERY SHORT!!!,45633,3
45633,"so I had to wear leggings with it
I order my right size which is  M  (I am 5'7) I have a feeling if I order an L it will look baggy on me",45633,3
45634,Love the style but to small  again,45634,3
45635,It's okay for wearing sometimes in winter but doesn't fully cover my head and is very full feeling around my neck and head.,45635,3
45635,Wouldn't recommend for a med to large head.,45635,3
45635,Gave it to my 10 year old.,45635,3
45636,This shirt fits well but when I opened the package it was a huge burst of a vinagar smell.,45636,3
45636,Had to wash the shirt three times to get that smell out.,45636,3
45636,"And as much as the shirt fit well, it looks like a poorly done photoshop job that was printed onto the shirt.",45636,3
45636,It still has blocky white edges along the body of pyramid head.,45636,3
45637,"These things are becoming so popular with music festival goers and the 'raver' or 'EDM' set, so I ordered two... one grey and one irridescent.",45637,3
45637,"They're actually really cool, once you figure out how to remove all the protective film.",45637,3
45637,"They need to have 'pull tabs' to get the film off... and yes, the plastic needs to be reinforced... it needs to be about 2 times stronger or thicker.",45637,3
45637,And I'd pay twice the price for a better quality product... especially if it was polarized.,45637,3
45637,If it was polarized I'd probably pay 4 times as much money for this.,45637,3
45637,I'm used to paying $400-$1500 for a pair of sunglasses each year...,45637,3
45637,"I don't buy watches or any other jewelry, so I justify my silly spending this way lol.",45637,3
45637,So make this stronger and give it UV protection and I'd pay $90 or more for it...,45637,3
45638,"Obviously a cute bag, but the price of shipping is just too much!",45638,3
45639,Loved the skirt but I noticed after I put it on there was a small hole in the front:(,45639,3
45641,"The fit is perfect, but they are not as long as the photo indicates.",45641,3
45641,I would prefer them longer but they'll do.,45641,3
45642,Extremely tight in the arms.,45642,3
45642,"I'm 5'10"" 190lbs and ordered a large.",45642,3
45642,It felt great everywhere except through the forearm and under arm pits.,45642,3
45643,"It's super cute but a bit on the ""too long"" side for my height...5 feet 3 inches.",45643,3
45643,I had to keep pulling the leg part up which made my thigh area look a little weird.,45643,3
45644,I ordered 2XB as it is the only size available although I'm really needing 2XL.,45644,3
45644,I was expecting the fit will be too big as I'm familiar with Polo Ralph Lauren products.,45644,3
45644,Always satisfied with Polo Ralph Lauren's quality.,45644,3
45644,Been a loyal customer for years.,45644,3
45645,"while I was able to still wear it as a shirt, it was way too short for a 5'10"" person...",45645,3
45645,However i liked it at a shirt so I was not too upset.,45645,3
45646,"A little smaller than expected, but overall ok.",45646,3
45647,I ordered a 2X and it was more like a junior 1X.,45647,3
45647,"Quality was good, soft material and I'm gifting it to a friend.",45647,3
45648,ususally you get what you pay for this is true with this swim suit.,45648,3
45648,still pretty cute though,45648,3
45649,"Gonna be honest they came in perfect condition and they stretch well, however they slide down within mere steps you take.",45649,3
45649,I like my thigh highs way over my knees.,45649,3
45649,They will be good for you if you prefer knee high socks.,45649,3
45650,Dress size was way too small,45650,3
45651,Nice thick sweater i repeat sweater not a dress anyway shape or form,45651,3
45652,I read all the reviews and ordered a larger size and it was still almost to small.,45652,3
45652,But I have washed it and the colors and size did not change.,45652,3
45653,Very shiny & sleek...loved it when I saw it!,45653,3
45653,Clasp broke first time I opened,45653,3
45654,Very flattering but runs large.,45654,3
45654,I'm returning for a smaller size.,45654,3
45655,Really cute but way too large...like everywhere.,45655,3
45655,"I'm very short and petite (5 ft tall, 95 lbs) so maybe I should have stuck with a kids version or something, but their very baggy and very obviously should be skin right so looks a bit awkward",45655,3
45656,I ordered and they are super soft before washing.,45656,3
45656,The reason for the 3 stars is because they are too small.,45656,3
45656,I would order a size bigger.,45656,3
45657,im 5'7'...... lets just say I had to give this to my friends that is 4'11' good quality though,45657,3
45658,I love the graphics but the size was way off.,45658,3
45658,It was too short and too tight.,45658,3
45658,I ordered 3X and it was smaller than most of my XL T-Shirts.,45658,3
45661,"Thin material,a bit smaller than expected.",45661,3
45661,"Washed okay, but I don't dry anything like this.",45661,3
45662,Okay for the price,45662,3
45663,Chunky faces stay away.. it doesn't fit that great--and it's not even accurate for Kakashi.,45663,3
45663,The headband should cover the eye and this should actually cover only the nose/cheeks/mouth.. not the eye.,45663,3
45664,A tough item to rate!,45664,3
45664,"It's not at all comfortable, had to be bent quite a bit to fit properly on my neck, and close to impossible to fasten with the fastener provided.",45664,3
45664,I finally gave up on that and now just use a safety pin to fasten it..,45664,3
45664,"Yet I love how it looks, and have always gotten compliments the few times I've worn it.",45664,3
45664,I can only wear it to events no longer than a couple hours  or it chafes too much and I need to take it off.,45664,3
45664,"So one star for comfort and ease of use, and fives stars for how it loojs and the compliments I get - average of three.",45664,3
45665,weird to put on and take off.,45665,3
45665,felt awkward on as well.,45665,3
45665,had to return and really wanted these for my outdoor runs,45665,3
45666,it s not toddler sizes.,45666,3
45667,The back is too low.,45667,3
45667,The back sets below my bra.,45667,3
45668,These are a bit small.,45668,3
45669,"But, even though I ordered a Medium, it is still VERY SMALL.",45669,3
45669,"I would like to wear it often because it is my LOGO...""LIPS"" But I have to wear a long sweater over it just to be comfortable.",45669,3
45669,I weigh 98 pounds but it is still too tight!,45669,3
45670,Cute top but doesn't fit as big as pictured,45670,3
45671,One of the ears turned out perfect...the other pair has glue on the outside and the ears are very floppy like they are going to fall off.,45671,3
45672,Cute....but the green ones are not jade!,45672,3
45672,"They left a green ""stain"" on my ears!!!",45672,3
45672,"Feel like stone, but they can't be real jade.",45672,3
45672,They looked good though..,45672,3
45673,Cute outfit but ran like 2 sizes too small ....,45673,3
45674,"Pretty shirt, fit too.",45674,3
45674,Small on my 13y.o.,45674,3
45675,It's just an ok bag.,45675,3
45675,I thought it would look a little more expensive.,45675,3
45675,The color was also lighter than on the website.,45675,3
45676,"Really good looking hat the reason why I gave it three stars is because I don't like how thin the fabric is on the back of the hat, in other words from the mid towards the back of hat is to thin for my taste.",45676,3
45677,Size was smaller than expected making the skirt too short.,45677,3
45677,I wish they had bigger sizes because it's cute and exactly what is shown in the photos.,45677,3
45679,"Pictures are deceiving,  wish the shirt was as nice as the picture, returned it, plus was way to big.",45679,3
45680,Wear it but short for me.,45680,3
45682,had to give away can't wear it,45682,3
45683,"Nice enough quality, but not for bigger tall people, I'm a size large/xl 5.8, barely covers my belly button.",45683,3
45684,A little small and shrank immediately when washed.,45684,3
45685,This dress fits like a tent.,45685,3
45685,I ordered according to the measurements given but two of me could have fit in it.,45685,3
45685,I am currently trying to take it in by reworking the back seem.,45685,3
45686,Item fits as expected and its adequate for the price.,45686,3
45687,These may be breathable and wicking but they are heavy.,45687,3
45687,They are well made and good quality but  I bought them as I perspire.,45687,3
45687,These have not improved my situation.,45687,3
45687,These are bulkier and take up more room when packed.,45687,3
45687,My reco to FoL would be find a way to make them thinner / lighter weight.,45687,3
45687,My expectations may not have been realistic but they were not met,45687,3
45688,It too like 2 weeks to arrive and everything fit except the waistband was extremely tight.,45688,3
45688,I gave the outfit away.,45688,3
45688,I didn't wear it for its intended use.,45688,3
45688,But everything else fit as expected the waist was just so tight,45688,3
45689,I wish it was a better quality but the price was right.,45689,3
45690,"If you are a plus-size lady, they will be too tight to wear all the way up.",45690,3
45690,I fold them over til they fit better.,45690,3
45690,Very soft and reasonably thick for the bargain.,45690,3
45691,This bathing suit runs approximately 2 sizes too small.,45691,3
45691,Once you resign yourself to that fact it fits and looks great!,45691,3
45691,"I am 5'3"" and usually fit in size 10 pants, medium dress, 38D bra and I received an XL.",45691,3
45691,The top was blouse enough to hide that problematic mid section and there is enough support and padding for the breast area.,45691,3
45691,Bottoms fit just under navel.,45691,3
45692,"Good Price at first, they make it back for shipping and handling.",45692,3
45693,"too short to be a dress, i have to wear it a a blouse.",45693,3
45694,Looked more like plastic in person,45694,3
45695,Terribly small.... size chart is F.o.s.,45695,3
45695,Returning and upset because I teallllly loved this suit,45695,3
45696,Not great but super cheap,45696,3
45697,A little wide for my daughter.,45697,3
45697,They slip at her ankles when she walks.,45697,3
45698,I really loved these leggings.,45698,3
45698,Still hope to wear them.,45698,3
45698,I was just kind of surprised when it said 'one size' then I received them and they were too tight on me!,45698,3
45699,The elastic strap is to big on one shoe.,45699,3
45699,On one of the shoes it's perfect but on the other side the strap is too big/loose!,45699,3
45700,Three stars--it's OK.  Two stars--I don't like it.,45700,3
45700,"It's cute, but I think it has what's known as a ""modern fit.""",45700,3
45700,"It is broad in the shoulders and the armhole is roomy enough, but the body seems closer cut than I expected or hoped it would be.",45700,3
45700,It's kind of snug in the chest.,45700,3
45700,I like the border terrier--I don't much like the fit.,45700,3
45701,Cute outfit but it seems to be for short people.,45701,3
45701,My aunt who is shorter than me can fit it.,45701,3
45702,"Small is exactly what you get, you can achieve the same by wrapping a rubber band around a few credit cards, no room for anything else.",45702,3
45703,Nice looking shoes but very narrow had to return,45703,3
45704,"I liked them, they came as exactly shown in the picture (I have also attached my pictures), however, it didn't go all the way, like the hook kind of just ended mid-air?",45704,3
45704,"I've seen some great nose piercings where the hoop goes all the way round, I didn't like that mine ended mid-air...Maybe my nostril is too big?",45704,3
45704,"Who knows..Anyway, still a great buy for the price!",45704,3
45705,"quality could be better, was expecting better from Woolrich, then the sizing, I measured myself and bought this to be a little large, because I like my clothes to allow freedom of movement.",45705,3
45705,I got it and it is skin tight.,45705,3
45705,order a size bigger.,45705,3
45705,and you will need to double check all the seams as there are lots of loose threads that will unravel.,45705,3
45706,The chain is a little to long.,45706,3
45707,Bows look more like tied up handkerchiefs- but still cute,45707,3
45708,"The quality is low, the fit is a tad too small.",45708,3
45708,You will really only want these for occasional costume purposes.,45708,3
45708,They will NOT last for frequent wear.,45708,3
45709,It is cute but hard to walk in and very stiff even after being washed several times,45709,3
45710,"Happy with the colors, very true to picture.",45710,3
45710,I followed some of the other reviews on here and went for a medium.,45710,3
45710,I should have gone for small.,45710,3
45710,"Since the price was so good, I just altered it a bit myself.",45710,3
45710,"Wonderful shirt, just wish sizing was clearer.",45710,3
45711,I got a medium because a lot of the reviews said true to size but I guess I have too much junk in my trunk.,45711,3
45711,A medium does fit IF I don't sit down.,45711,3
45711,I'm 5'6 and weigh 138.,45711,3
45711,Cute if they ended up fitting well.,45711,3
45711,"A large almost seems like it would be too big, but I was contacted by the vendor to see if I could fit a different size or if there was anything they could do to make my purchase better.",45711,3
45711,"I am returning the medium, I will see if a large fits!",45711,3
45713,Not what I was hoping it would be but still love it cause its the boys!,45713,3
45714,The only reason I am giving this five stars is it took way to long to get here.,45714,3
45714,"Other than that, perfect, super soft and cute",45714,3
45715,ya get what ya pay for!,45715,3
45716,I expected two pair !,45716,3
45717,it was bigger then I wonted,45717,3
45719,comes in handy when i go to bed its' very light.,45719,3
45719,but it's kinda small but it does stay on.,45719,3
45720,"As described by other reviewers, the clips are tight, which is not a huge deal.",45720,3
45720,I used a screwdriver to open them a bit more.,45720,3
45720,"Also, the clips do not all open at the same time, which can get annoying, unless you leave all the clips swung open.",45720,3
45720,"The wood itself is ok, and the packaging that it came in was in a bag.",45720,3
45720,It was also just wrapped in a styrofoam material as it's only source of protection.,45720,3
45721,The dress underneath is nothing like the picture.,45721,3
45721,The dress is all nylon.,45721,3
45722,"Please know, the undershirts run small.",45722,3
45722,I really like the quality,45722,3
45723,"I bought this swimsuit in a medium based on other reviews that I read, the bottom was just a tad small but I made it work.",45723,3
45723,I love the design of the swimsuit and it looks sexy but the material is a bit thin.,45723,3
45723,The tassels also look a bit unfinished but otherwise it was okay.,45723,3
45724,"I ordered the orange pair, hoping it was close to the shade it showed online.",45724,3
45724,"When they arrived, they were closer to a coral color.",45724,3
45724,"Still somewhat orange, just not the shade I was hoping for/expecting.",45724,3
45724,"The glasses themselves seem sturdy and block sun quite well, so I'm pleased in that regard.",45724,3
45725,The bottoms are really small.,45725,3
45726,The pants fit but a little on the small side in the butt area.,45726,3
45727,We followed the size chart and it was large.,45727,3
45727,"My sister is 5'5, ~110 lbs and we ordered a size 4.",45727,3
45727,"The top was taken in about 1cm and the skirt was hemmed about 5in, that's with 2 1/2-3"" heels.",45727,3
45727,"Some of the beading had fallen off before we even received it, and where it hadn't fallen off the threading was loose, so we fixed some of those areas.",45727,3
45727,"I think the dress is worth $75-100, not the $140 we spent.",45727,3
45727,I've purchase much cheaper dresses in bet quality.,45727,3
45727,Other than that it looked beautiful on her and it did it's job!,45727,3
45728,"Too small, didn't realize there was elastic around bottom, but gave to daughter and she loves it, so there you go",45728,3
45729,Seam split after one gentle wash.,45729,3
45730,The glasses arrived on time and well packaged.,45730,3
45730,"However, they are made in China, not Italy as my other pair as I bought these as replacements.",45730,3
45730,They'll do the job but I have my doubts on them being from China and having faulty printing on the inside where it shows the model number and what not.,45730,3
45730,"Other than that, they look fine, I just hope they will last as long as the original ones.",45730,3
45731,I love the dress it's gorgeous but I was not aware that it came with a build in bra.,45731,3
45731,So when I measured myself I had a bra on and the dress was far to large in the bust.,45731,3
45731,Having to have a seamstress take in the bust.,45731,3
45732,I like these leggings but they run really small.,45732,3
45732,I had to send back the medium to get an XXLarge and they still fit a bit snug.,45732,3
45733,I don't know why clothes can't run the same size.,45733,3
45734,"The earings are very pretty however I had a allergic reaction to them, I was assured that the stud itself was Surgical steel But the actual top part is not...........So for me these do not work as I would need the entire earring to be surgical steel.",45734,3
45734,"The company contacted me and explained the top was not surgical steel  asked me what issues I had and asked If I would like a refund, I responded and explained my allergic reaction and said a refund would be nice.",45734,3
45734,They Did refund me.,45734,3
45734,All in all the earings are very pretty and would have loved to be able to wear them,45734,3
45735,I like the purse just not the split pouch inside.,45735,3
45735,Whatever you put in just falls out anyways so for me it has no purpose.,45735,3
45736,"It's ok for a the first few wears, after a while it stretches out and doesn't really ""hold"" it in",45736,3
45738,The strap broke within a week.,45738,3
45738,Otherwise my kid absolutely loved them.,45738,3
45738,"We improvised and ""fixed"" them.",45738,3
45738,Luckily my kids are easily pleased.,45738,3
45739,much smaller than expected,45739,3
45740,This is quite short and I would definitely wear something under it.,45740,3
45740,I needed it for my bachelorette party so it worked great but I lost a lot of sparkles so I don't know how this would do with laundry.,45740,3
45741,Style doesn't fit like picture.,45741,3
45741,It is much shorter at the waist,45741,3
45742,I do like this top and the crochet.,45742,3
45742,It fits nicely as there is some flare to it.,45742,3
45742,Sort of an A-line.,45742,3
45742,"Since I ordered it in white and looked at those pictures, I didn't realize that the sleeves also flared out.",45742,3
45742,I don't think I like that at all.,45742,3
45742,I guess I will have to take out the sewing machine and remedy the situation.,45742,3
45742,I should have paid more attention.,45742,3
45743,I returned it because it was uber small.,45743,3
45743,The item iteself was beautiful and looked well made.,45743,3
45744,Love the stripes and style.,45744,3
45744,Hate that this shirt runs about 2 sizes too small!!!,45744,3
45745,It looked as expected..but fit a bit smaller than what I expected..not much stretch to it.,45745,3
45747,It's really cute but runs very small.,45747,3
45747,"I'm petite, 5'2"" with a small waist 110 lbs, typically wear XS or S, I purchased this in size small and it is very small and doesnt fit properly.",45747,3
45747,I would recommend buying one size up,45747,3
45748,"The material is good, it's well made.",45748,3
45748,I should of went with a large or a extra large.,45748,3
45749,It's just another aluminum wallet from walmart.,45749,3
45749,I ripped the acordian card holder out abs stuffed my cards in it.,45749,3
45749,Rattled like crazy so i stuffed a few bills in to quiet it up in my pocket.,45749,3
45749,Greber money clip is better just holds too few things for me.,45749,3
45749,Week two the hinges get twisted and closes alittle off set.,45749,3
45750,Maybe OK if flat tummy.,45750,3
45750,"I have the mommy tummy budge, Normally size 10-12 and it normally hides that, however the 2X doesn't.",45750,3
45751,Very cute bracelet but it turns on your wrist and the flower ends up on the bitten of your wrist instead of the top.,45751,3
45751,"Other reviews warned of this and I should've listened :(
I'm
Not crazy about that at all.",45751,3
45752,Bought this for my 20 year old brother.,45752,3
45752,Turns out it fits my 12 year old brother,45752,3
45753,I ordered two sizes up than normal and it was really wide around the chest area.,45753,3
45753,It's a bit of a short dress.,45753,3
45753,"I ordered an XXL and I am 5""8 and weigh 175 lbs.",45753,3
45753,The dress is a lighter blue than the picture and isn't exactly the same quality as the picture.,45753,3
45753,"I wish it had been a little bit nicer, but it is what it is.",45753,3
45753,It did come with a lovely pin.,45753,3
45753,The pin is metal and stays on very well.,45753,3
45753,I really love the pin.,45753,3
45753,I'll make some alterations to the dress so that it's not so wide on me.,45753,3
45754,"My son is 1 year and 5 months old, I bought this shirt in size 24 so that he gets to wear now and for the next few months, sadly it barely fits him now, mind you my baby has a small frame, he's not fat or even chubby.",45754,3
45755,I like it but I wear a light shirt under it so that the arms where the design is doesn't rub me.,45755,3
45755,With out a shirt under very uncomfortable.,45755,3
45756,"I'm 5'6"", 135lbs, and I work out.",45756,3
45756,I have a butt...these bikini bottoms were way too small.,45756,3
45756,I'm between a B and C cup and the top only covers the middle of the breasts.,45756,3
45756,There is no lining anywhere.,45756,3
45756,"Perhaps it would fit someone better that is slim and small chested, but then again, I had the back tie of the top pulled as tight as it would go.",45756,3
45756,"20yrs ago, I'd rock it for a night at a party, but I can't imagine wearing this to swim...I was looking for a boho style bikini for the beach, but I returned it, because I can't even imagine what all would be popping out if this thing got wet & the embarrassment of my kid.",45756,3
45756,It would take strategic movement to ensure the important parts are covered (even when it's dry).,45756,3
45756,"Again, let me say...if you're looking for something hot & sexy for a night out, it is.",45756,3
45757,A lovely shirt but runs small,45757,3
45758,Runs at least a size small,45758,3
45759,"Love the bathing suit, but there was no elastic in the butt.",45759,3
45760,"Though it was a good value, I didn't care for the quality of the material, as I thought it was to thin.",45760,3
45761,The color is deceiving.,45761,3
45761,I thought that the jeans were more of a bright pink not Coral.,45761,3
45761,"The price was okay, therefore, I decided to keep because of the price.",45761,3
45762,I wish that this came in extra small.,45762,3
45762,"I was previously a size 0, so the small really isn't right enough.",45762,3
45762,"However, it would probably provide good support for a true size S.",45762,3
45763,Looks just like the pic but i wear a medium and that was a little too big.,45763,3
45763,"Took it to the tailor so, I'm back in business.",45763,3
45764,"Much too long for me, other wise, ok.  At it's current length, it'll just be a house dress only.",45764,3
45764,Was hoping for more.,45764,3
45765,But for the price i wasn't expecting great quality.,45765,3
45765,"its a nice dress, but im sure it won't hold up long.",45765,3
45766,"Cute dress, fits perfectly until it gets pass the knee then it's loose.",45766,3
45767,If you follow the size directions then you should be able to find your ideal fit.,45767,3
45767,This suit is really vibrant in person and fits nicely.,45767,3
45767,I ordered this suit mainly for the top.,45767,3
45767,"I suspected the bottoms weren't truly high-waisted, which was true.",45767,3
45767,They fit me more like large briefs.,45767,3
45767,I'm not comfortable wearing the bottoms at this point since they point of high-waisted for me is to cover up the extra tummy.,45767,3
45767,I'm pairing the top with a black high-waisted bottom.,45767,3
45767,I usually wear a 12 or 14 and size large and ordered 4XL in this suit.,45767,3
45767,Edited: I didn't realize when I originally tried on this suit that the top didn't fit me properly.,45767,3
45767,Tried it on again today and I think I ordered the wrong size.,45767,3
45767,I think a 3XL would have been a better fit for me.,45767,3
45767,Really disappointed because it's super cute!,45767,3
45768,"Now that it's cold enough to actually use these, I find the left glove's little finger interior is sewn short.",45768,3
45768,Must have only tried the right glove on when received.,45768,3
45768,Don't make the same mistake I did.,45768,3
45768,I'm left with only a single glove I can use which is useless to me.,45768,3
45769,I like the dress but it was a little snug.,45769,3
45769,But I have hips and maybe that's the reason it was a little snug.,45769,3
45769,I normally wear a size 18 and I got the XXL.,45769,3
45769,Wish they had plus sizes...,45769,3
45770,"I ordered this suit for someone else, so I haven't heard any complaints from her so far.",45770,3
45771,It's a nice top and you can adjust the size with the straps.,45771,3
45771,Only bad thing is that it's completely see through so your nipples are showing through the shirt.,45771,3
45773,Case is alright bust fastener is already coming apart,45773,3
45774,"Overall cute costume, but be aware that it's not as dark as it should be.",45774,3
45774,"I usually wear a medium in clothing, but took other reviewers advice and ordered a size up.",45774,3
45774,The large fits fine.,45774,3
45775,Like it not the color I expected and a bit big in the sleeves but over all a nice dress,45775,3
45776,Rides up a little too much.,45776,3
45777,Not well made- you get what you pay for...,45777,3
45778,Bought for my sister for prom.,45778,3
45778,"It looked as pictured, maybe a little more red than pink.",45778,3
45778,We took her measurements and they were exactly the same as the 24w.,45778,3
45778,"When we got the dress, (took a couple weeks to ship, probably due to the dress having to be made, fast shipping once it shipped), it was a little too big in the bust area and waist.",45778,3
45778,Which was easily altered by a family friend.,45778,3
45778,"Also the detailing on the bust looked a little odd up close, there are U shapes that look like they would go underneath to frame your bust  but they just sat on top.",45778,3
45778,"OVERALL it is a decent dress, my sister loved it and had a great time in it.",45778,3
45778,Personally I would not order a dress online again due to not being able to try it on and find that dress with the perfect fit that flatters your body.,45778,3
45779,So I bought the large and loved it.,45779,3
45779,Then I lost it one drunken night while de-layering at a bar.,45779,3
45779,I like it so much that I bought it again and waited the month or so for it to get here.,45779,3
45779,But this time I bought the medium.,45779,3
45779,"I liked the large for layering, but I thought it would look cuter a little more form fitting, so the second time I bought the medium.",45779,3
45779,I'm a little disappointed that the cloth changed- the large one was made out of cotton that felt really nice and soft.,45779,3
45779,"The medium is made out of polyester and spandex, which is darker and stretchy but feels synthetic and kinda gross.",45779,3
45779,"The zipper isn't YKK, and the handle broke off after about a month of use.",45779,3
45779,"I put a bobby pin in to use it, but the zipper is already sticking and needs graphite.",45779,3
45779,However I really like it still.,45779,3
45779,"I don't usually wear it zipper-front without a shirt under it, but the cut of it makes that work backwards.",45779,3
45779,I tried to photograph it honestly!,45779,3
45779,"I'm 5'4"" about 120 lbs and a 34B",45779,3
45781,It for sure brings cleavage yet no support.,45781,3
45781,"it is sticky enough for long time wearing, yet at the end of the day it left residual glue on my skin.",45781,3
45782,Cute but way too big,45782,3
45784,These capris are okay.,45784,3
45784,"I'm always a small and although these fit like a small in the body, they are very long.",45784,3
45784,"Also, the fabric isn't great.",45784,3
45784,I would not buy them again.,45784,3
45785,It's hard to read what it says.,45785,3
45785,The crystals aren't lined up right to look very good.,45785,3
45786,It was way too lose.,45786,3
45786,It was purchased for a 12 year old and it says made for an adult so not the products issue.,45786,3
45786,We did return the next day but it looked good for the price,45786,3
45787,"The heart shaped neckline look odd, with the way it is cut.",45787,3
45787,Not sure what the problem is.,45787,3
45790,"A bit smaller fit than some of the other brands I have bought, and a bit Short on the tail.",45790,3
45791,"Not true to size, way to small.",45791,3
45791,Gave to a friend who loved it.,45791,3
45791,I really wish it fit though because other than the size it was beautiful.,45791,3
45792,I got a hot spot on the bottom of my foot the first day I wore them.,45792,3
45793,"Like the bag, but one of the straps broke off",45793,3
45794,"First things first, sorry for the lack of better photos.",45794,3
45794,They were taken not for reviewing purposes in mind.,45794,3
45794,Some are screenshots of a video my friend sent to a bridesmaid who lives long distance.,45794,3
45794,I sadly don't have an option to upload the video via mobile app.,45794,3
45794,"Okay, now onto the review!",45794,3
45794,Shipment: It got to me in the two day mark (Amazon Prime).,45794,3
45794,The package will be a lot smaller and lighter than you would think.,45794,3
45794,It came with a jeweled belt/sash and some sort of bag.,45794,3
45794,(I won't be using the bag included as a garment bag.,45794,3
45794,It's way too small.),45794,3
45794,Sizing: I am normally a size 6-8 in dresses depending on the store and cut of the dress.,45794,3
45794,"After reading someone's suggestion to order a size up, I did, and I am so glad that I did.",45794,3
45794,I got a size 10 and it barely fit me.,45794,3
45794,"If it was any smaller, my butt wouldn't have slipped in the dress comfortably.",45794,3
45794,"Also, I am 5'7 in height without shoes.",45794,3
45794,You will need to wear heels to make up for the extra length at the bottom.,45794,3
45794,I suggesting maybe 2-3 inches if you're my height.,45794,3
45794,"Putting this on: If you have a more curvaceous bottom, step into the dress versus putting this over you.",45794,3
45794,"The bottom is made more slim (the mermaid style), and putting it over your head  would cause the dress to suffocate you.",45794,3
45794,"(Lesson learned first hand, lol!)",45794,3
45794,"How it looks: Let me say this first, there are two visible seams running down the front.",45794,3
45794,"If I was a more financially blessed individual, I would have immediately returned this.",45794,3
45794,"Due to the price, I can't say that I'm surprised.",45794,3
45794,Items made in China tend to look different than what's modeled in the stock photo.,45794,3
45794,It's a huge problem and that's very sad.,45794,3
45794,"On a positive note, this fits my body perfectly.",45794,3
45794,"Anything smaller, anything bigger, and I would have been doomed.",45794,3
45794,Material: This is a very cheap material.,45794,3
45794,It's super light and thin.,45794,3
45794,You would need to be careful of what kind of spanx and dress slip you would wear underneath.,45794,3
45794,The seams may show through.,45794,3
45794,Suggestions to buyers: Buy this if you're on a budget.,45794,3
45794,It doesn't look bad and it'll do for the one hour wedding ceremony.,45794,3
45794,"Buy those sticky bras to help you lift your ""girls"" if you're a B cup like myself.",45794,3
45794,"Moreover, your thighs will be together while you walk.",45794,3
45794,Wear spanx that has shorts at the bottom to prevent chaffing.,45794,3
45794,Message to the Seller: Please provide your own photos when selling something.,45794,3
45794,Therefore it leaves little room for misleading the customer.,45794,3
45794,The two visible seams in the front are not acceptable.,45794,3
45794,"Unfortunately (or fortunately), you caught someone like myself in a conundrum because of how well it fits and how inexpensive it is.",45794,3
45795,Certainly not an XL.,45795,3
45795,Unable to come pass my shoulder.,45795,3
45796,Cheap and does its job.,45796,3
45796,Some look skeptical like they've beeb uses.,45796,3
45797,"Its looks nice but its super obvious its a fake, the diamond is scratched",45797,3
45798,"Product is very nice, but sizing runs very small.",45798,3
45799,"I love the overall design of the shirt, the lace is heavy duty so fear of ripping is minimal which is a huge plus!",45799,3
45799,"However, the material of the shirt is cheap, extremely cheap, but not itchy and does not irritate my skin so I see no problem in it for the price I paid!",45799,3
45799,"This shirt does run small, but so doesn't everything from China!",45799,3
45799,"The sleeves is what erks me the most, they are a tad short on my arms, and I do not have monkey arms!",45799,3
45800,the style is great but the size is way too small.......didn't realize that China's sizes differed from us.......that should be posted on Amazon's site so customers are aware of it.,45800,3
45801,Beautiful costume but very small for the actual size.,45801,3
45801,I have to give it to my niece.,45801,3
45802,Came to me broken,45802,3
45803,Good quality ... Pedi M and so I stay .,45803,3
45804,Not true to size,45804,3
45806,"It's a little small for me, but it looks good.",45806,3
45807,Nice pair of rings.,45807,3
45807,I just didn't like the black ring rest three are really pretty.,45807,3
45807,I am using them as thumb rings.,45807,3
45808,the straps could be a little bit longer or maybe adjustable.,45808,3
45808,The material is great and the length.,45808,3
45808,the straps just feel a little bit tight.,45808,3
45808,The shirt fits well otherwise,45808,3
45809,Expressed hope that the model name on the packaging.,45809,3
45810,"The workmanship was very good, but the sizing is not right for curvy figures, just too narrow in the hips.",45810,3
45811,The material is very stretchy even though its like a cotton material.,45811,3
45811,Kinda reminds me of a one size fits all.,45811,3
45811,"I'm 5'5, 147 pounds and I would have liked for it to be more fitted.",45811,3
45811,I will say that the set is made really well.,45811,3
45811,It looks exactly like the picture.,45811,3
45813,It may be just me and the degree of difficulty getting gloves on a toddler vs. mittens.,45813,3
45814,"These looked cute, but were too big and impractical for a girl with small nipples and an active hockey league.",45814,3
45815,Does not supports boobs,45815,3
45816,Wasn't clear that it only comes with one.,45816,3
45816,Would have appreciated a heads up but the photo shows two.,45816,3
45816,I now have to wait another week for the second.,45816,3
45816,"Otherwise, I like it.",45816,3
45817,I do wish it was just a little bit larger.,45817,3
45817,"And, it only stands up on it's own for so long!",45817,3
45818,its good quality but it was too small for the size it described,45818,3
45821,A bit thin but can't really see through them,45821,3
45822,The only reason I ordered these were for the purple ones so I was disappointed when I got them and saw that they were so dark that they actually looked black...,45822,3
45823,This is very well made.,45823,3
45823,"Fully lined, lots of detail, nice fabric.",45823,3
45823,But beware of the sizing.,45823,3
45823,"I usually buy a small, but I looked at the measurements and sized up to a medium to be safe.",45823,3
45823,It arrived and I was not even close to zipping it.,45823,3
45823,The listed measurements were way off.,45823,3
45823,Be safe and size up two full sizes.,45823,3
45823,I wish it would have fit.,45823,3
45823,It was really cute.,45823,3
45824,I very much like the packaging and the feel of the socks when worn.,45824,3
45824,"However, the first sock started tearing apart after 2 months' use.",45824,3
45824,"Compared to major brands, that is below average.",45824,3
45825,Longer than I expected,45825,3
45826,smaller than pictured just ok,45826,3
45827,"I'm kind of disappointed, it's a cute hoodie but the sizes run kind of small if you a bit bigger than the average girl or if you have thick arms.",45827,3
45827,"I got a large and it was way too small, when I would lift my arms up it showed my bra!",45827,3
45827,I don't recommend this too thick thick women,45827,3
45828,"I'm normally a US 10, ordered the large and it fits like a US 6-8.",45828,3
45828,"Its so pretty though so I'll give it to my teen, hence the 3 star review.",45828,3
45829,Doesn't quite reach below my waist.,45829,3
45829,It does stretch so I've been tugging.,45829,3
45829,It's cute with a tank under it..Totally inexpensive.,45829,3
45831,"It looks decent but my gf has a hard time fitting in it, especially in her chest",45831,3
45833,It's not bad but it's just too wide and too long.,45833,3
45833,I'm not tall and I don't think a small would be much shorter so it's the wrong proportion.,45833,3
45834,Really see through- even in red.,45834,3
45835,My Godson loves the shirt.,45835,3
45836,Its kinda cute - got a 70s look to it.,45836,3
45836,There is a big orange button down stripe in the back.,45836,3
45836,Its a wee bit big I think but the pictures and the material don't quite seem the same.,45836,3
45836,The material is kinda rough - perhaps a run thru the washer will fix that - but its a pretty thick fabric,45836,3
45838,ok so they lasted about 1 hour.,45838,3
45838,"at least they made it through my wedding ceremony, and on our walk out, they broke.",45838,3
45838,they looked beautiful tho!,45838,3
45838,but the quality sucks and they  won't last if you decide to walk more than 50 yards.,45838,3
45839,The dress fits oddly.,45839,3
45839,"It was very tight across the butt, and very loose across the waist.",45839,3
45839,"The top is a very shiny material, and doesn't quite go with the lace look of the rest of the dress.",45839,3
45839,"It was made well, the material is thick and strong, and the zipper was sturdy.",45839,3
45839,I just didn't like how it fit.,45839,3
45840,I can feel the seams from the different fabric rubbing my legs a little.,45840,3
45840,"It's not a problem, just a little strange feeling.",45840,3
45840,"They look very cute on, just like the photo.",45840,3
45842,I didn't have the time or patience to return them.,45842,3
45843,The fabric is actually very lightweight which is okay with me.,45843,3
45843,It did turn out to be quite large.,45843,3
45843,I guess it'll have to be the oversized look.,45843,3
45844,I am very short and from advertisement expected the top to be much longer.,45844,3
45844,"Also, I ordered the aqua and received white.",45844,3
45846,the top fits but I'm disappointed that IT IS NOT A PUSH UP AS ADVERTISED for good support like I would have liked and the bottoms fit,45846,3
45847,it was awkwardly made.,45847,3
45847,it looks like it was meant for a smaller frame.,45847,3
45847,always get a larger size than expected to ensure that chest is properly covered,45847,3
45848,Nice good for price for it,45848,3
45849,Kinda cheap made its almost see through!,45849,3
45851,runs a little small.,45851,3
45851,I bought a size larger based on other recommendations and it fits.,45851,3
45851,Is a little short in length.,45851,3
45852,Quality is not as good as Shadowline.,45852,3
45852,Learned my lesson-will never order another gown except one made by Shadowline.,45852,3
45853,Color is not as bright and vivid as pictured.,45853,3
45853,And the bottoms are very tiny.,45853,3
45854,"cute, but not for girls that have a bigger chest.",45854,3
45854,my breasts kept being exposed and popping out the sides.,45854,3
45854,i had to keep looking down to make sure i wasn't exposing the public.,45854,3
45855,looks really cute on but it's really see through.,45855,3
45855,I wouldn't mind having to wear a white tank top underneath but I have large breasts and the layering is not my taste but the fit is good.,45855,3
45856,"Zipper does not work as expected, I'm having hard times zipping the purse, purse is nice overall",45856,3
45857,The shirt was too small for me and the short sleeves do not look like the picture.,45857,3
45858,SHOULDERS GET WIDER THE LARGER THE SIZE....,45858,3
45859,"The item seems to be of quality material and is beautiful, however, this is not a dress but rather a shirt.",45859,3
45859,My daughter is short for her age and this 'dress' sits at the middle of her rear end while standing so she can wear this with leggings but it doesn't look as cute.,45859,3
45859,Just want others to know that this isn't really a dress.,45859,3
45859,I will be returning.,45859,3
45860,It runs a little small.,45860,3
45861,Over the years I've continuously tried to find gloves that will keep my hands warm downhill skiing in Minnesota.,45861,3
45861,"Although these are nicely made gloves, they will not keep your hands warm below 15 F. They fit snugly, but that's a disadvantage if you live in a cold climate where it's necessary to use glove liners.",45861,3
45861,"Also, the zippered pocket isn't designed to retain or distribute the heat of of a warming packet.",45861,3
45861,The warmth will not reach your fingers.,45861,3
45861,The seller is willing to replace or refund if you have original packaging.,45861,3
45861,What I've found that works are MEN'S HIGHCAMP 3-FINGER GLOVES with one or two glove liners depending on the temperature.,45861,3
45861,These OR gloves also work well with Seirus Thermax Liner Gloves which have a pocket for a heat packet so that all of the heat is released within the insulation of the glove (now that's a smart design).,45861,3
45861,Update: So these work reasonably well at 25 F or above.,45861,3
45861,They are questionable between 15 and 25; a temperature range you don't want to be questioning whether your gloves are going to keep your fingers warm; and below 15 forgetaboutit.,45861,3
45862,"This is really cute, but just barely big enough in the bust.",45862,3
45862,I am 36DDD and ordered an XL.,45862,3
45862,The other problem is that it snags...and then the thread pulls.,45862,3
45862,"I will probably wear it one more time, with plainer jewelry, and figure I got my money's worth.",45862,3
45863,"Just average; nice for a small gift or stocking ""stuffe"" or in an Easter basket.",45863,3
45864,beautiful color/pattern but not for everyone...,45864,3
45865,The straps are a little long,45865,3
45866,"These are a little smaller than the photo would have you believe, but they're still very cute.",45866,3
45866,I prefer large bows and they work well on my almost 2 year old.,45866,3
45866,"The bow itself though is not attached, its simply a piece of cloth slid through the loop.",45866,3
45866,If you have a toddler who pulls at her bow I would suggest hot glueing or putting a stick in them to make sure you don't loose the bow portion.,45866,3
45867,"Stylish and comfortable shoes that will last your active child about 1.5 months, which is why I rated them as 3 stars.",45867,3
45867,The front of the school has started to come up like the picture in a previous review.,45867,3
45867,My next purchase will be of a higher quality shoe since my daughter's shoe size has been pretty unchanging for about 4 months.,45867,3
45867,"My daughter, however, loved the look of the shoe because she didn't need to choose between her two favorite colors.",45867,3
45868,"Its an alright jacket for the price, however the colors don't exactly match the picture, its about four to six shades darker then expected.",45868,3
45868,"It also is a little bit bigger then expected, the sizing chart is not correct.",45868,3
45868,Otherwise for the price its a decent jacket.,45868,3
45869,These are very expensive gloves which I have already lost one in the laundry during their first wash.,45869,3
45869,The quality is excellent with very beautiful patterns.,45869,3
45869,I also love the medium size since my scratchy baby is now 6m.,45869,3
45869,"Unfortunately, I do agree with other moms that the Velcro is very dangerous.",45869,3
45869,I took them all out and cutting the extra flap.,45869,3
45869,"To sum it, I had to put a lot of work into these gloves for them to work out.",45869,3
45869,I don't think they are worth the money.,45869,3
45870,The strap is made of a very cheap material.,45870,3
45870,It broke for about a 2 weeks.,45870,3
45871,"Good clutch but the chain quality is poor, it breaks after every use.",45871,3
45872,"Very small, it's cute but very thin.",45872,3
45872,I have to wear it under a sweater.,45872,3
45872,The buttons don't match right so it's kind of weird.,45872,3
45872,Not a big fan.,45872,3
45872,But it was cheap.,45872,3
45873,It is a nice shirt and my son likes it.,45873,3
45873,Would have liked to have the more popular characters on it.,45873,3
45874,"Love this little snitch necklace but, the chain was super short making this more of a choker than a true necklace.",45874,3
45874,Plus the chain broke quickly.,45874,3
45874,"I would suggest purchasing a separate, longer chain or using one you have at home and moving the snitch charm to that before wearing this necklace.",45874,3
45875,Does not feel like soft leather feels like vinyl.,45875,3
45875,Nothing on or in bag saying leathet,45875,3
45877,Cute shoes but somewhat heavy on 5 year olds foot.,45877,3
45877,Hedisnt like them and said they rubbed against heels,45877,3
45878,"I needed a cheap costume, it fit the bill.",45878,3
45878,"The top runs small - and not only a little tight, but the torso is really short.",45878,3
45878,I lift up my arms and the shirt is half way up my stomach.,45878,3
45878,The skirt is stretchy and basically has no fit to consider.,45878,3
45880,This is for tiny chested girls.,45880,3
45880,"Which is funny to me, because it's the girls with larger chests that NEED COMPRESSION and concealment ........ Order two sizes UP...if at all.",45880,3
45881,Bought the pack of 5 shirts.,45881,3
45881,They shipped super fast.,45881,3
45881,"The shirts themselves fit well, but the sleeves are a little too wide.",45881,3
45881,"The body portion of the shirt fits well, but the arms are really loose.",45881,3
45881,"Overall, cheap price for decent quality shirts.",45881,3
45882,the size runs VERY small,45882,3
45883,I ordered this as a 4x and it was so small.,45883,3
45883,The back wouldn't zip.,45883,3
45883,It fit more like a 2x.,45883,3
45883,Order 2 sizes larger than you normally wear.,45883,3
45883,I am so sad because this dress is so so pretty and made quite nicely.,45883,3
45884,It was tight around the chest area and too long it sag in the croch area,45884,3
45885,Cute but too small,45885,3
45886,Something is up with the sizing of these flip flops.,45886,3
45886,I've previously bought Havaianas from stores in size 37/38 and they fit perfectly; these were about 2 sizes too small.,45886,3
45886,"When I ordered on size up, they were way too big for me.",45886,3
45886,"Given the variability in their sizing, I won't buy this brand online again.",45886,3
45887,This dress did not look like the photo.,45887,3
45887,It was kind of cheap looking.,45887,3
45887,The tulle over lay made me think of a Halloween costume.,45887,3
45887,The fit was really nice though.,45887,3
45887,"Size ten fit perfectly - I am 5' 7"", 135 lbs.",45887,3
45887,except it was a little short.,45887,3
45888,Shorter then I like.,45888,3
45888,Hit above knees and I have short stubby legs.,45888,3
45889,"The pajamas are ok, but I definitely could have gotten the quality or better for half the price at Walmart.",45889,3
45889,"Basically, I paid double the price for the convenience of having them delivered directly to my home in two days (on bedrest with pregnancy and can't leave).",45889,3
45889,They are more than accommodating for my baby bump!,45889,3
45889,"The pants are a little shorter than average, but I appreciated that due to my 5'1"" height.",45889,3
45889,"I would recommend avoiding the gray color, as I do look like I've recently escaped an asylum when wearing them.",45889,3
45889,"Bottom line, if you have the time, go to Walmart.",45889,3
45890,Mmmm...don't know what to really say bout this lol.,45890,3
45890,Does look like how it's pictured but it loses its twist in the front cuz it unravels to where your trying to get it back to the look of it lol don't know if any of this makes sense but it sucks that it tangles up a lot :/,45890,3
45891,SOMEWHAT SMALL BUT IT DOES THE JOB,45891,3
45892,About a size too small.,45892,3
45892,Nice decal but too tight and stuck with it.,45892,3
45893,"First, I ordered set 6 - Dashing, because I thought the colors were: pink, red, gold, blue/grey, green.",45893,3
45893,"When I received them they were actually: light pink, dark pink, lavender, green.",45893,3
45893,"Those colors didn't work for us, so I sent them back.",45893,3
45893,Then I ordered set 4 - Stylish because I thought the colors of the last 2 ties pictured were red and black.,45893,3
45893,"When I received them the red was more of a pinkish red, and the black tie was actually gray.",45893,3
45893,It's not that big of a deal.,45893,3
45893,"They will work better than the first set, but I wish the colors were more accurate.",45893,3
45894,Nicely made but thicker than I expected.,45894,3
45895,These shades work great...,45895,3
45896,"wouldn't necessarily say the ""best"" but they are alright.",45896,3
45896,was a little irritated after the first use one of the shirt stays already broke the sewn in seam that keep the clips the same length.,45896,3
45896,They also tend to not want to hold on very well even after being loosened completely.,45896,3
45897,The XL isn't American XL.,45897,3
45897,Too bad because it's a great jersey.,45897,3
45898,but I don't like that it comes with a bag instead of a box so It doesn't look real Pandora Charm!,45898,3
45899,Looks great and feels nice.,45899,3
45899,"Only one troubles - they often fall off during ""games"".",45899,3
45899,Be ready to revamp it.,45899,3
45900,This was just what I thought.,45900,3
45900,I did like it and It looks exactly like the picture but it was short on me.,45900,3
45900,Like other people have mentioned already if you don't have a small torso then it won't fit comfortable and as far as the breast cup size I think it was just fine from there.,45900,3
45900,I ordered 1 size up and this didn't work out for me.,45900,3
45900,I got my order in about 7 days it was quick but sadly I'm Goin to have to send this back.,45900,3
45901,It looks just like the picture but I was surprised that it ran big.,45901,3
45901,It's always hit or miss buying from these Chinese vendors.,45901,3
45901,I bought a large since Asian size tends to run small.,45901,3
45901,I think I could go with small or medium.,45901,3
45901,"I am a 4-6 US size, 34D & hips 39"".",45901,3
45901,I'm under 5' .,45901,3
45901,It runs a little short in the torso.,45901,3
45901,The bottoms tie with strings so it adjusts.,45901,3
45901,The front portion gaped open at the part where top & bottom meet  & the padding looks odd but it is removable.,45901,3
45901,I'm not sure if a smaller size would fit better in the front.,45901,3
45902,Does not go as far down the stomach as it shows in the picture.,45902,3
45902,But fits everywhere else.,45902,3
45903,their OK no Under Armour better to spend a few dollars more and get UAs..,45903,3
45903,"Mine are too tight on me, never had that problem with UAs",45903,3
45904,I'd love a stronger tapper to the torso lapels but over all a great thread count.,45904,3
45905,"it fits ok, but if it had been longer in size it would have been better, that is the reason I am giving it only 3 stars.",45905,3
45906,Not as large as it should be.,45906,3
45906,Product is nice and I like it but it is a bit smaller than shown.,45906,3
45907,"Beautiful, but part of earrings fell out of the settings.",45907,3
45907,Have to get some glue to fix it.,45907,3
45907,Other than that I love it!,45907,3
45908,"I barely fit it on though :-( The length was mini, which I expected, and was adorable.",45908,3
45908,It also had a great stretch.,45908,3
45908,BUT the lace arms/shoulders were too tight to make it fit right.,45908,3
45908,"I usually wear a size 8 bottoms and size medium top in women's/large top in juniors...I'm 5'3"", 150 lbs.",45908,3
45910,Fits fine but very very stiff.,45910,3
45911,Just OK.  Not crazy about the material.,45911,3
45911,But a good size for travel,45911,3
45913,The breast part feels like it can slip and the bottom part was saggy,45913,3
45914,I have short hair so it's not really a problem.,45914,3
45915,Beautiful style but hangs pretty loosely in the waist even for a style that is meant to be loose-fitting.,45915,3
45915,"I'm 5'7"" and ~160 lbs with a long torso, wide shoulders (15""), and long arms (I like sleeves to be 24"").",45915,3
45915,"I usually wear U.S. size 12 in tops, and I ordered size large.",45915,3
45915,The sleeves were too short for me.,45915,3
45916,"It cam with a stain, but rather then that it was nice.",45916,3
45917,Good quality and quite warm but the legs are quite long.,45917,3
45917,I'll need to get them hemmed.,45917,3
45917,Plus there are no pockets.,45917,3
45917,"So, I only rate them as OK.",45917,3
45918,Nice dress and fits as expected.,45918,3
45918,The material's not as cheap as I expected for the price.,45918,3
45919,"So the socks are well made, but thin (makes sense since I will be wearing them with flip-flops).",45919,3
45919,The only complaint I have is the part that is made for the smaller toes is too long (looks awkward and boxy).,45919,3
45919,I will only be using these around the house so I'm not too disappointed.,45919,3
45920,Ran smaller than some other suits I ordered but was a nice swimsuit,45920,3
45921,The bathing suit was nice but the bottom fit and the top was to big couldn't wear it gave it away,45921,3
45922,"Online looks better, but I would recommended to a friend.",45922,3
45924,Looks better on the thin model than on me (size 16/18).,45924,3
45925,"I absolutely love these, despite being too large in the waist and I had to cut holes in all the button.",45925,3
45925,I still wear this but I wish I had gotten a smaller size.,45925,3
45926,"Cute, but barely there(in a bad way) and I feel like I'm gonna break this thing.",45926,3
45927,It looks like plastic but is very spacious,45927,3
45928,Nice looking but the glasses came in crooked and uneven.,45928,3
45929,"Looks stylish, not really ""high end"" design.",45929,3
45929,Jeans and beer uniform.,45929,3
45930,Too tight and not stretchy at all,45930,3
45931,Too tight for me.,45931,3
45931,"Will keep and wear, but not for what was intended.",45931,3
45932,Bought this as gift for my child's friend.,45932,3
45932,It was a nice little necklace but the lightening bolt makes it top heavy and flips down all the time.,45932,3
45932,It stays in places as long as it's against your skin but as soon as you bend forward and it hangs loose it flips.,45932,3
45933,It's a cute set.,45933,3
45934,Love the print not the quality,45934,3
45935,It was too big so I returned it.,45935,3
45935,As I tried it on regardless the size it was just not fitting night.,45935,3
45935,"However, this item did not agree with me.",45935,3
45936,This pajama is very cute but is a bit tight on the rear end to the point that it is a bit uncomfortable.,45936,3
45936,Tight as in the bottom of the short squeezes into your leg.,45936,3
45936,Feels as if you are wearing a small underwear.,45936,3
45937,Very nice hat just heavier than I expected,45937,3
45938,you have to order 1 size bigger,45938,3
45939,"Overall, I like the product.",45939,3
45939,Just make sure you buy an extra size up!,45939,3
45940,"I loved the outfit, but top was way too big.",45940,3
45940,I am going to see if there is a way I can have taken in.,45940,3
45941,This onesie stretched out very quickly.,45941,3
45941,I would say that the quality is less than carters.,45941,3
45941,"I expect the clothes that I buy to last through more than one kid, and I doubt this will make it through one.",45941,3
45941,I would not waste your money.,45941,3
45942,"As advertised, ended up returning it because it was too small, but I do have a big head.",45942,3
45943,"Cute bottoms, however the straps on the top are way to long.",45943,3
45944,"As an orthotic, I think the quality is fair.",45944,3
45944,They offer more support and are more comfortable than other low-cost orthotics I've tried.,45944,3
45944,But they are too large for most of my shoes and make me feel as if my heels are slipping out of my shoes as I walk.,45944,3
45944,They also did not offer enough heel cushion for me.,45944,3
45945,"Very nice crown, xs dress is very tight for a 5 foot 3, 100 pound girl",45945,3
45946,"I was disappointed in the quality of this scarf, though the colors are beautiful.",45946,3
45946,The edging and the stitching look a little cheap.,45946,3
45946,The photo doesn't show how pretty it really is.,45946,3
45946,I bought it as a gift and didn't have time to exchange it.,45946,3
45946,Hopefully my friend will not be as picky as I am!,45946,3
45947,I never wear this shirt.,45947,3
45947,I love the design but I can't wear it due to being a little chubbier than what is required.,45947,3
45947,"HOWEVER, I feel that if I bought a maybe larger one, it would fit smoothly.",45947,3
45948,its very tight to put on.... but its beautiful when fits.,45948,3
45949,they are smalll but cute!,45949,3
45950,I bought this for my daughter who is in high school.,45950,3
45950,I should have paid closer attention to the size.,45950,3
45950,The material is not as durable as I had hoped and overall the size was unimpressive.,45950,3
45950,The style was cute and colors were vivid.,45950,3
45951,Doesn't accentuate my lady humps.,45951,3
45952,"Too big, had to return.",45952,3
45953,I ordered a medium.,45953,3
45953,I wear a 34D bra and the elastic band was very loose.,45953,3
45954,"Summary: These are okay, but sadly, they definitely show an underwear line.",45954,3
45954,"Pros:
- Not see through
- Lots of color options
- Fit as expected (but consider sizing up if you have a larger bum to decrease the underwear line problem)

Cons:
- Show underwear line, so I don't wear them much in public, even to yoga class",45954,3
45955,I only wear this gardening,45955,3
45956,The Scarf is nice and covers my head and neck well.,45956,3
45956,The Aqel rope is too small for my head so that part is worthless.,45956,3
45956,Would buy a different pattern if it the rope wasn't so tiny.,45956,3
45958,"Shipped fast and well, but one ear was chipped.",45958,3
45958,"No broken piece in package, so whoever packed it missed it.",45958,3
45959,Dress fits perfectly but it has a hole in it!,45959,3
45960,"The shirt is very short in the front, since I am 5'10"" it is on the line of belly top.",45960,3
45960,It would look like image for shorter person.,45960,3
45961,Hat was a bit cheap but it worked for a Scottish funeral,45961,3
45962,"It fits a little weird.. Has a lot of volume like a puffy skirt.. A little too much, I thought the skirt was going to be simple, going down but its still cute",45962,3
45963,I had to return this top because it is sized as a 3x,45963,3
45964,"I ordered the 6x because I normally wear a 3x (I read the product information, says this was the right size for me).",45964,3
45964,"The trainer was a bit short, came a little above my ""other"" tummy :-).",45964,3
45964,I love the fabic.,45964,3
45964,It's made really well.,45964,3
45964,Just wish it was a bit longer and with adjustable straps.,45964,3
45965,I've worn this brand for years.,45965,3
45965,These are definitively  smaller than the old ones.,45965,3
45966,I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights.,45966,3
45966,Super cute and flezable.,45966,3
45966,"BUT for running, absolutely not!!",45966,3
45966,It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride.,45966,3
45966,I run about 2-4 miles every few days.,45966,3
45966,Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill.,45966,3
45966,"Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.",45966,3
45966,"MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run.",45966,3
45966,I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road.,45966,3
45966,I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner.,45966,3
45966,Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.,45966,3
45966,I LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms.,45966,3
45966,They really give me support and flex needed.,45966,3
45966,I have also used Asics and Puma.,45966,3
45967,"It's very cute & perect for the beach, but it smells so bad; almost like fuel oil.",45967,3
45967,I've washed it several times and still can't get the smell out.,45967,3
45967,I wish I had read the description better and saw that it came from China.,45967,3
45968,"I think these glasses are OK, they look good, they have a nice fit, I still gotta try them in the middle of the day when sunlight is heavier.",45968,3
45968,I would like that you would include a piece o fabric or at least a fabric bag to protect and clean the glasses.,45968,3
45968,The case it is too big to carry on a small bag.,45968,3
45968,"Obviously these are a replica, though the price of the product it is very good.",45968,3
45968,"When I bought my original sunglasses in a local strore they incluided a few other things such as genuine certificate, the original case (which is smaller and more elegant) and also a fabric bag to protect and clean the glasses.",45968,3
45969,Ok for the price.,45969,3
45969,The small has S/M on the tag and it's definitely a medium.,45969,3
45969,I have a waist and the waistband is very loose.,45969,3
45969,The top is an ok fit.,45969,3
45969,"The leg is slightly too wide, not crazy so, but I can tell they will ride up.",45969,3
45969,"I'm only planning to wear it for a 4the July run so I'm not too disappointed,  but this is not genuine running gear.",45969,3
45970,I didn't realize that the back was as bare as it is.,45970,3
45971,I was very disappointed in the size; the measurements that are on the product were very misleading.,45971,3
45971,These items were much smaller than I expected.,45971,3
45971,I think it will work but I was hoping for something a lot larger.,45971,3
45973,Will see after first washing.,45973,3
45974,"This is not ""blue"" - its ""teal"".",45974,3
45974,"I bought all of my supplies to go with this (wig, makeup, etc) to match blue and I got my wings today to discover they are teal...green hue.",45974,3
45974,":/ Color goes pretty much all the way through - sure, ""inside"" is lighter than the outside but when you open them, the light around you bleeds through.",45974,3
45975,The material is kinda coarse and fits slightly big when I thought it would be the soft and clingy kind.,45975,3
45975,But then for the price may be it's right.,45975,3
45976,It is a nice nightgown - I am tall and the sleeve length was alittle short.,45976,3
45976,I wish it was a little longer.,45976,3
45976,"Other than that, very warm and pretty",45976,3
45977,This suit is adorable - better than photos - seems of high quality - great colors- unfortunately didn't fit .,45977,3
45977,I am 5'9 and 132 lbs .,45977,3
45977,35 B/C on top.,45977,3
45977,The cups were HUGE!,45977,3
45977,Also torso is a little short for someone tall.,45977,3
45977,Sadly had to return.,45977,3
45978,These were a little tight around the hips but they are long for us tall folk.,45978,3
45980,the waist was fine and so was the hips.,45980,3
45980,the abdomen area was where the problem lied.,45980,3
45980,it was somewhat large,45980,3
45981,Cool Jammie pants - wash in cold or else!!,45981,3
45982,It was HUGE - massive!,45982,3
45982,Gave it away...but it was lovely looking.,45982,3
45983,This was a nice product except for the size.,45983,3
45983,"Also, the color was a little different from what is seen on the website.",45983,3
45983,It was a little more grayish and looked dull.,45983,3
45983,Quality was good though.,45983,3
45983,"Eventually, had to return the product as it was not what I ordered.",45983,3
45984,didnt notice much lift maybe i need a different size,45984,3
45986,"I am 5'9"" which is hardly short for a woman and yet the dress drags on the ground unless I wear heels.",45986,3
45986,Who wants a summer dress they can relax in if have to wear heels all the time?,45986,3
45986,Also I am a 42DD and dress still too loose in chest area.,45986,3
45986,Will have to pin or wear something underneath so I am not spilling out of dress.,45986,3
45986,colors very pretty though.,45986,3
45989,Backs fall off really easily for my five year old.,45989,3
45989,I even put them on super snug.,45989,3
45990,"Size Small- Ehh, it's ok.",45990,3
45990,It's longer than I expected and too big.,45990,3
45990,"I'm 120 lbs, 5""3, small waist.",45990,3
45991,"I ordered XL and they are very tight for my 34"" waist.",45991,3
45991,They look great and are wearable though.,45991,3
45992,"great for winter, but the footy part was big and that caused the whole pjs to feel big,",45992,3
45993,It just didn't fit me well.,45993,3
45993,But the design is very interesting.,45993,3
45994,"I really like the way these earrings look and I think my students will get a kick out of them, but one of them was broken when it arrived.",45994,3
45994,"The ""nucleus"" bead had fallen off.",45994,3
45994,"Thankfully, it was still in the box so I super-glued it back on.",45994,3
45994,"A+ design, C for construction.",45994,3
45995,"The front closure doesn't come nearly together enough for me, but it is pretty.",45995,3
45996,Very sheer and I am not a big fan of the material.,45996,3
45996,"It is slimming, but I would have preferred better quality material.",45996,3
45997,"Not the same one as in the picture, it's a very cheap quality but still looks nice if accessorized well!",45997,3
45998,Runs Small and is very revealing!,45998,3
45999,I was expecting the garment to be longer in length.,45999,3
45999,Otherwise I have enjoyed wearing when I piece when I want to relax and still look presentable.,45999,3
46000,Cute but very tight.,46000,3
46000,I wear a large and I ordered an x large.,46000,3
46000,You just never know with Asian sizes.,46000,3
46001,Only problem I had was that it was see through.,46001,3
46001,I suggest getting a slip to wear underneath.,46001,3
46002,Pants were ripped when I received them (1 foot of hem was un-sewn).,46002,3
46002,"I did get a full refund, however.",46002,3
46002,Everything else was find for the price.,46002,3
46003,Took a pretty long time to finally get them and they don't look as pictured because they are very see through and just look exactly like tights that cut off right over the knee.,46003,3
46003,They also don't go up over the knee as much as I expected but I have long legs because I'm 5'9.,46003,3
46003,Good for the price though.,46003,3
46004,dress was cute however it was not the length that was on this picture it was ALOT shorter,46004,3
46005,Looks like real leather but buttons fall of easily,46005,3
46006,Y don't like fabrics,46006,3
46007,"The dress runs small, so I would recommend buying the next size up.",46007,3
46007,The material isn't the best quality- reminds me of a deluxe Halloween costume.,46007,3
46007,"It's not soft Cotten, more like a stretchy cotton/polyester blend.",46007,3
46007,It is extremely low cut so you would definitely need to wear a cami underneath.,46007,3
46007,I have a bigger bottom area and it fits well there but seemed to be tighter around my stomach which rarely happens so I feel & look pregnant.,46007,3
46007,I think I would have liked it more if I would have ordered up.,46007,3
46008,A little large about the description,46008,3
46009,I'm 5ft and 100 pounds.,46009,3
46009,I ordered a size small.,46009,3
46009,It served the purpose but it was not the most comfortable bathing suit.,46009,3
46009,It was tight by the shoulders and tight by the straps at he bottom of the bathing suit.,46009,3
46010,This hat is ok.,46010,3
46010,"I wanted it for the beach, and something cheap that I wouldn't care if it got ruined.",46010,3
46011,you get what you pay for ..these are cheaply made I would suggest these for playing dress up!,46011,3
46013,This tie is fine.,46013,3
46013,The length is good and the color of the blue stripe is good.,46013,3
46013,"However, the cranberry stripe looks faded out from certain angles.",46013,3
46013,"Straight on it is a nice cranberry color, like in the photo, but from other angles it looks much lighter.",46013,3
46013,"That might be what they mean by ""metallic cranberry.""",46013,3
46013,"If you don't mind the color change, this should work well for you.",46013,3
46013,"I'll keep it, but I likely won't wear it often.",46013,3
46014,Nice bottom nice material but the top had no padding and it's very lose,46014,3
46015,"I am an adult size large (dress size 12), but I ordered the XL to be safe since  - it was a very small fit, I couldn't get it zipped up the back.",46015,3
46015,"If you have breasts, this dress is not for you.",46015,3
46015,"It's incredibly adorable and well made, and I love the design of course, but I was ultimately disappointed with the fit.",46015,3
46016,"I didn't like or dislike, I bought it for a friend.",46016,3
46017,They shrunk a ton!,46017,3
46017,I'm used to things shrinking a size but these became super tiny after an accidental drying.,46017,3
46017,"The colors while very bright and bold upon arrival faded extremely fast, after the one accidental drying the colors appear to be as though they've been washed and dryer for years and years.",46017,3
46017,"They are see-through, nice for around the house as long as you're around people comfortable seeing your package in it's entirety.",46017,3
46017,Very affordable is definitely the saving grace with these.,46017,3
46018,"it's beautiful, however, runs VERY small.",46018,3
46019,Very small an tight,46019,3
46020,"I'm 5'2 and the top is nowhere near as long as in the picture, which was the look I was going for.",46020,3
46020,"However, even with that being the case, it's still a cute shirt and the fabric is nice and soft.",46020,3
46021,this is a lovely cuff but doesn't hold hair ties like I had hoped,46021,3
46022,Didn't rest on my wrist very well but it might just need to be worn a few times first.,46022,3
46023,It's a very nice fit,46023,3
46024,"some of the stones were out when I got it, hopefully I can glue them in",46024,3
46025,"I had been looking for low cut cotton socks for a while and for some reason they are somewhat hard to find, as most of the liner socks sold out there are synthetic.",46025,3
46025,I really like these - they are perfect for my Keds and Vans.,46025,3
46025,"They're cute, soft and comfortable except for the fact that, as other reviewers have mentioned, they do slide off in the back when I do more walking in them.",46025,3
46025,They are one size fits all so that may have something to do with it - I'm a size 6 and perhaps the socks are a little too lose in the back.,46025,3
46025,"A hole appeared on the big toe of one of the pairs after about 20 wears, and by the looks of it, the same fate awaits the other pairs.",46025,3
46025,"I do wish you could choose the colors that come in the set - I got a 5 pack and received black, white, pink/peach, lilac, which were all cute, and a neon yellow, which I was not a fan of.",46025,3
46026,"Wish it fit a little better
But warm and comfortable",46026,3
46027,Well it wasn't that great But it fits me Im big headed but yeah.,46027,3
46027,"its kinda disapointing but looks really good nothing like the picture but it still covers my face and it looks see through not with it on but with it off not on anything I was a little disapointed but it looks great on me  it came a little bent or more plastic on this side then the other side, but after all  its a pretty great product Itd be ashamed if you let it go for this price the spray paint is a little weared off and whatever you used wasn't to great.",46027,3
46027,the blush isn't to great the moustache looks different on both sides and some lpacec its weared off and deeper on the other side.,46027,3
46027,But I was happy with this purchase I cannot take bpictures because I have no Idea how.,46027,3
46027,"This was really great but it looks nothing t all like the picture Disapointed and More happy then disapointed I thought it would look more like the picture as you can see I put a lot of thought into one review XD, thaats all great product little disapointed.",46027,3
46028,I got this for my husband.,46028,3
46028,He hasn't wore it yet.,46028,3
46028,I will give a mother review after he wears it.,46028,3
46029,The jacket fit well and was good for the price.,46029,3
46030,"Once again, we didn't receive the correct color.",46030,3
46030,"We like the glasses, but sure wish we could purchase all plain brown.",46030,3
46031,Cloth could have been of a better quality.,46031,3
46032,"I used the measuring guidance provided, but the belt was still too small for me to use more than a week or two post-partum.",46032,3
46033,This necklace was great at first.,46033,3
46033,But after a few times wearing it the bottom piece of the stone chipped off.,46033,3
46034,I'm a big guy and got the biggest size they have.,46034,3
46034,I would get a size larger than the chart says if you're accustomed to Western fits.,46034,3
46035,The length of the skirt is fine but getting it up and over my butt and legs was the challenge.,46035,3
46035,I ended up putting in a zipper.,46035,3
46036,Was frayed in places around elastic.,46036,3
46036,Bit...lower than it looks but when the weather's hot who cares.,46036,3
46037,Not as fitted as it shows in the picture.,46037,3
46037,I folded some of the material over on itself to create an extra drape so that the top would be less baggy and the bottom would lay better.,46037,3
46037,"Not a bad dress, but not quite as nice as the pic.",46037,3
46038,"It's a beautiful dress, don't get me wrong.",46038,3
46038,But I'm going to have to get it tailored to fit.,46038,3
46038,It's going to cost me more to tailor it than it did to buy it.,46038,3
46039,"It's rest cute,  but if you have a bigger chest get a bigger size",46039,3
46040,Cute shirt but don't dry in dryer when washing.,46040,3
46041,"Very long even for a 5""7 girl.",46041,3
46041,Had to be hemmed.,46041,3
46041,Color was lighter than expected.,46041,3
46041,Great shipping time frame.,46041,3
46044,Fabric to heavy for summer wear.,46044,3
46045,Mines was much shorter than the picture however.,46045,3
46046,"These are beautiful earrings but they came to me in pieces, and I can't get the set to stay in.",46046,3
46046,I was so disappointed because they are so pretty.,46046,3
46047,Just had this a few days.,46047,3
46047,"Wish it was a bit thicker, but fine for the price.",46047,3
46047,"Don't know at this early date how the plating will hold its shine, but okay for now.",46047,3
46048,"Cute, but runs somewhat small...they are indeed soft and cozy...not for higher arched feet.",46048,3
46048,"They're okay, but nothing spectacular...",46048,3
46049,It is already pilling.,46049,3
46049,Haven't washed it yet.,46049,3
46050,for some reason they didn't do stitching on the bill on this hat as opposed to the same hats from this series they made for A New Hope and Return of the Jedi.,46050,3
46050,I don't know why they left it off of this Empire Strikes Back one.,46050,3
46050,"Either way, it is a good hat.",46050,3
46050,I also have the Endor one from Return of the Jedi which does have the stitching on the bill and i feel like it's slightly higher quality.,46050,3
46050,Also: SIZING RUNS 1 SIZE SMALL ON THESE.,46050,3
46050,I'm usually a 7 and 1/4 to 7 and 3/8 but i needed a 7 and a half in this one.,46050,3
46051,"I was well aware this is set ran small, I did not miss that.",46051,3
46051,Normally I fit a medium so I ordered a large for this reason.,46051,3
46051,I just opened the package and it honestly looks like a kids bathing suit.,46051,3
46051,"I'm not that mad because it clearly says it's small, but I'm just really disappointed that the seller put their name on this",46051,3
46052,"I love everything about this dress, except the length.",46052,3
46052,"So just a warning, if you are thinking about it, be aware.",46052,3
46052,"The fabric feels great, the top of the dress fits perfectly.",46052,3
46052,Trying to figure out some way to where it in public and still feel clothed.,46052,3
46053,"Very nice, tight in chest area.",46053,3
46054,came a little smaller then expected.,46054,3
46055,Wish the logo wasn't a look of iron on and also there is a little extra room in crown.,46055,3
46056,Love the fabric but more of a bodycon dress (I have big hips),46056,3
46057,The boot is good for walking.,46057,3
46058,OK for a little fun,46058,3
46059,The binding around the leg openings is a bit weak.,46059,3
46059,The underwear tend to creep up if you're doing anything physical.,46059,3
46059,It needs more tension.,46059,3
46060,"It's soft and stretchy, but was over a size bigger than expected and is thin (not very warm).",46060,3
46060,Works well as a nursing top.,46060,3
46061,"I bought a xlarge and I'm a size 14, came in fast but It was a nylon material and was tight...also bow in back was pink and blue and mine was ripped and messy but it was super cheap and I think my 11 year old will like it",46061,3
46062,"The holes are actually a little on the uncomfortable side, and they leave little round marks all over your stuff.",46062,3
46062,They look cooler than they feel.,46062,3
46063,For my 2yr old niece.,46063,3
46064,Little scratches on the lens but you get what you pay for..,46064,3
46065,"Incredibly sheer ( you would have to wear a black undergarment, for sure).",46065,3
46065,"I wear a size 12 USA, and it was so tight, I was uncomfortable.",46065,3
46065,"I almost couldn't get it back off  My daughter wears an 8, so I gave it to her.",46065,3
46065,"So I would say if you are over a size 10 the ""one size"" fits all doesn't really apply.",46065,3
46066,"Tiny is misleading...it's a fairly average size pendant, suitable for kids and adults!",46066,3
46066,I'm not a statement jewelry person and prefer to buy fairly inexpensive silver toned necklaces with small pendants that I can layer or switch out frequently - oh and I also love butterflies!,46066,3
46066,"I was hesitant to buy this since there were no reviews, but I received a discount on the necklace for my own review, so I took the plunge!",46066,3
46066,The necklace was Prime eligible and arrived in 2 days.,46066,3
46066,"This is pretty rare for Amazon jewelry at this price point, I usually find it comes from overseas and takes weeks to get.",46066,3
46066,It arrived in a huge lightly padded envelope which offered very little protection and is a waste of materials.,46066,3
46066,"Luckily, the necklace was safe and sound, sealed in a small plastic baggie with a cute business card/thank you from the seller, who is a small California based business.",46066,3
46066,"The necklace arrived twisted with a small knot, so I fixed that up and noticed instantly how SHORT the chain was.",46066,3
46066,"I only wear 18-21"" chains and I knew immediately this was not the 18"" that was promised in the product description.",46066,3
46066,"I measured it and it came in under 16"".",46066,3
46066,It was almost a choker on me.,46066,3
46066,"However, both the chain and the butterly are lightweight and comfortable.",46066,3
46066,"The butterfly sits nicely without constantly flipping over and the wings are soft, rounded edges, so it is comfortable to wear.",46066,3
46066,I just switched the pendant out to another chain.,46066,3
46066,The chain itself isn't bad.,46066,3
46066,Basic chain that you find with most costume pendant necklaces.,46066,3
46066,The clasp is easy to open/close and is secure.,46066,3
46066,The butterfly itself is adorable!,46066,3
46066,"It is not quite as shiny as I saw online, which I prefer, because it gives it a nicer look.",46066,3
46066,The metal (it is described as bronze) does not bend or misshape and the detail on the butterfly is pretty.,46066,3
46066,I am glad that the butterfly isn't tiny.,46066,3
46066,It is dainty and perfect for a simple look.,46066,3
46066,"It is appx 1/4"" x 1/4"" for people like me that don't measure in millimeters.",46066,3
46066,"For the price, the detail of the butterfly and the 2 day prime shipping, this was a great buy and I will wear the butterfly often this summer on another chain and on a charm bracelet.",46066,3
46066,"However, minus 2 stars as the chain was 2+""  shorter than described and a better packaging solution would offer more protection to the item and less waste (no loss of stars for packaging).",46066,3
46066,I hope seller fixes the description of the chain size to match the actual product.,46066,3
46067,"Thin material, but I guess it will be ok with long shirts or tunics.",46067,3
46068,Did the job for the most part.,46068,3
46068,We did have one that leaked though.,46068,3
46068,"Without side snaps, it also makes it very hard to take off when it has poop in it.",46068,3
46069,"These capris are very wide at the thighs and calves, which is what I did NOT need or want.",46069,3
46069,"For the price, they are very nice, though they need ironing.",46069,3
46069,The waist fit comfortably.,46069,3
46069,"If I hadn't needed a pair of dress white capris or a specific function, I'd have returned them.",46069,3
46069,"Instead, I'll haul out my sewing machine and take them in down the sides.",46069,3
46069,"That's a major issue because of the pockets, but it's doing that or wearing them as is.",46069,3
46069,"The fabric is nice, and not see through, which is a plus for white.",46069,3
46069,"I do not know why all clothing makers assume that a woman wearing a plus size (and 16 is barely plus), has huge thighs and legs!",46069,3
46069,I have cheerleader legs and like to show them off!,46069,3
46070,"I just lost my RayBans in Mexico, and after watching the Luxottica monopoly video by 'Adam ruins everything', I decided to not buy any Luxottica brands (including RayBans).",46070,3
46070,"So, this is a perfect NOT Luxottica brand with good quality for the prices that the glasses should cost if there was no monopoly in the market.",46070,3
46070,"I like these, they're sturdy and seem to be very good quality.",46070,3
46070,"UPDATE (2 stars): After only 3 months or so, the hinges became super loose and I wasn't able to make them tighter even when I tighten up the screws, this glass is useless.",46070,3
46070,"UPDATE2 (3 stars): The customer service reached out to me and offered to send a new pair for free since I had a bad experience, which is great and I would have loved to update my review to 5 stars, but the hinges on the new pair I received are way too tight and they rattle and crackle when I open and close them as if they need some lubrication.",46070,3
46070,"These are nice glasses, if only they can figure out how to work the hinges.",46070,3
46071,"The workings are great, materials are nice, but it is kind of bulky with very narrow slots to place multiple cards if you have a lot to carry around.",46071,3
46072,OK. Would have been perfect with front pockets.,46072,3
46073,The sizing is well done.,46073,3
46074,"This dress is very pretty, the colors were nice, and the material is stretchy.",46074,3
46074,"It fit me well, but it was cut too narrow at the top and it will show the sides of your breasts.",46074,3
46074,It just wasn't for me.,46074,3
46075,"Delivered quickly and is an adorable item, but is way too small.",46075,3
46075,"I usually wear a large but this ""large"" is about the size of a small!",46075,3
46076,It's a beautiful coat but the sizes are off,46076,3
46077,"Nice quality fast shipping,  but they are too small.",46077,3
46077,Bought a pair for each of my kids and NONE fit.,46077,3
46077,I just got them all the same size shoes from K-mart (as a spare/gym shoes) and they have plenty of room to grow in those.,46077,3
46077,I couldn't even squeeze their feet in these DC's so it can't be that I just goofed and ordered the wrong sizes.,46077,3
46077,":(
I'm returning and reordering in a bigger size for each,  hoping they get here  and FIT before school starts!",46077,3
46078,If your an American woman of European decent (usually taller or longer limbed) this will NOT fit you....,46078,3
46078,Even by sizing up!,46078,3
46078,However my grandmother is a petite Korean woman and it fit her beautifully.,46078,3
46078,Glad I could pass it on at least.,46078,3
46078,"I'm giving 3 stars because it's a gorgeous coat, made well.",46078,3
46078,"But the sizing is horrible, even by the chart.",46078,3
46079,Had to cut the inner pouch out.,46079,3
46079,Even by doing that it still separated the boys if you know what I mean.,46079,3
46079,Maybe these are made for really small guys.,46079,3
46079,The fabric feels great.,46079,3
46080,"a bit on the large side, but nice for the price",46080,3
46081,Great style but the material is bad.,46081,3
46081,Not bad for the price but it would have been better if it was cotton,46081,3
46082,Longer and baggier then I had hoped but its ok,46082,3
46083,Cute pants made for tiny short people.,46083,3
46083,"I'm about a 12 so I ordered the largest size available, but I still have a little trouble getting into them.",46083,3
46083,Apparently in China no one has a booty!,46083,3
46084,Expect a tight fit.,46084,3
46085,I usually wear a large.,46085,3
46085,I ordered an XXL and it fits like a medium,46085,3
46086,"Button itself is very nice, but it is only connected to the pin by spring tension.",46086,3
46086,The button part popped off and was lost within 2 weeks.,46086,3
46086,I ordered a replacement and will glue this one together.,46086,3
46087,"It's okay for the price, needed a clutch in a pinch for a weeding, did the trick.",46087,3
46088,"Bought this as a gift for a friend, it was well made, but i was under the impression that it would be a long (dress like) tank like the photo.",46088,3
46088,It was a normal length take top that i recived.,46088,3
46088,Lukily my friend liked it anyway!,46088,3
46089,"I've bought these in the past from a retail brick and mortar store, and they were a perfect fit, so when I bought the same size online and they were a little smaller, I was very disappointed.",46089,3
46089,"If this holds true for all sizes, then I would recommend buying the next size up just to be safe.",46089,3
46090,It had buttons on bottom.,46090,3
46090,Did not like that at all,46090,3
46091,Beautiful color and nice texture but too small for me to use as a wrap.,46091,3
46092,They where some what small.,46092,3
46092,And they didn't have the next size up.,46092,3
46093,These shoes are very cute but run a little narrow,46093,3
46094,Not as thick as i thought.,46094,3
46094,Definitely not a winter shirt,46094,3
46095,"They look nice, but eating is slightly thicker than the other so it doesn't fit in my ear the same.",46095,3
46096,Quality not so good but fits too price,46096,3
46097,But the material is a little clingy and it does not fall or hold as it should.,46097,3
46097,It bunches up while you walk it makes it an extra mini skirt.,46097,3
46097,Higher quality fabric would have been better for this look.,46097,3
46098,They wher cute in all but too small so had to give away,46098,3
46100,"Great shoe, but order a size up!",46100,3
46101,Not at all what I expected.,46101,3
46101,Looks nothing like the picture.,46101,3
46101,But I will somehow make it work for what I need it for.,46101,3
46102,I don't have all peices.,46102,3
46103,"A little on the tight side, usually buy a 2X, so thought a 3X would be loose, but it wasn't.",46103,3
46104,The sizing on this thing is CRAZY!,46104,3
46104,make sure you pay attention to the sizing chart!,46104,3
46104,"Aside from that it fits like a glove, the only down side is all the padding in the built in bra makes it small in the chest.",46104,3
46104,I would not recommend if you are bigger chested.,46104,3
46105,"Gay logo is brighter in the picture , back snapback almost broke first time adjusting, cheap plastic .",46105,3
46105,Im tired of Chinese CRAP .STICK TO MAKING YOUR DRUG CHEMICALS  Immoral bastards,46105,3
46107,It's great because it has lots of room.,46107,3
46107,Maybe just too many pockets for me.,46107,3
46107,Will take me too long to find which area I put my phone or keys...You have to be really organized not to have to sit around and fiddle with every zipper finding what you need.,46107,3
46108,Runs too small for  Americans.,46108,3
46108,Should try to order a couple size larger,46108,3
46109,SOMETHING IS JUST OFF BUT  IT.,46109,3
46110,Pro: It fit pretty nicely based on their sizing chart.,46110,3
46110,"Con: The flowers are not like in the picture, off more to the side, but rather almost in the exact middle of the dress, which makes it look odd.",46110,3
46111,"I love the shirt, but it is way too big for my grandson.",46111,3
46112,"I really like the design and fit of this white shirt, however it is very see through - you have to wear with another shirt defeating the purpose of a cool shirt",46112,3
46113,"It's very cute, looks good on.",46113,3
46113,A little shorter than I like.,46113,3
46113,I am 5'8 138 lbs.,46113,3
46114,It's a 3D printed mask with what appears to be vacuum tubing attached.,46114,3
46114,You will still have to plastidip if you want it to take paint and keep it without flaking.,46114,3
46114,"There are others that are better quality out there, although it is definitely hard plastic.",46114,3
46114,"No give, and slightly small on a head that wears a medium hat.",46114,3
46115,Very Good productos take a little longer to delivery the product is good,46115,3
46116,"Sent a size up, and it fit.",46116,3
46116,"Unfortunately it ripped the same day I wore it, and that sucks",46116,3
46118,Does not look real at all!,46118,3
46119,"Way to big--gave them to my husband, so it's not a loss!",46119,3
46120,Ordered a medium but feels more like a small but delivery was quick.,46120,3
46121,Colors are fading in patches,46121,3
46122,"A little to large for my facial features, but made well.",46122,3
46123,I love it....but it is falling apart....I have had to reinforce the stitching 8-(....,46123,3
46124,"Love the color, not so fond of the shape of the neckline",46124,3
46125,My daughter loves these boots but the decorative zipper keeps breaking.,46125,3
46126,Cute but could stand to be a little bigger in the shoulder area,46126,3
46127,Nice quality but I usually wear 0 or 2 and the small is still too small on me.,46127,3
46128,"One sleeve (basically one HALF of the entire top, since it's basically two squares sewn together) was longer than the other.",46128,3
46128,I had to shorten it myself with a sewing machine.,46128,3
46128,"Annoying, but I had the time and inclination, it wasn't super difficult, and now it's adorable.",46128,3
46128,"So, all in all, considering the price and the quality, I would purchase again, but with caution.",46128,3
46129,"I bought a couple of these Halftee shirts, size 3X, thinking I could finally wear short-sleeved or sleeveless tops without exposing my obviouly hefty arms.",46129,3
46129,"While they will doubtless come in handy during the winter under 3/4 or even long-sleeved blouses, their sleeves are so long and snug that they do not even come close to camoflage and the fabric retains sharp wrinkles where it is pushed up and at the inside elbows.",46129,3
46129,"A bit disappointing, but they are at least of some use.",46129,3
46129,These will likely do well for S-M-L ladies.,46129,3
46130,130 lbs 5 feet 9 inches.,46130,3
46130,About 2 sizes too small for me,46130,3
46131,Hat is more Painter style so bigger and deeper than cadet hat.,46131,3
46131,It takes a while to shape it right as the design makes it somewhat stiff and puffy.,46131,3
46131,It's a bit pricier than others but it did arrive in a short time.,46131,3
46132,Fabric is thinner than expected.,46132,3
46132,Kind of a let down.,46132,3
46133,One of them were cracked,46133,3
46134,This is a very cute carrot costume!,46134,3
46134,The material is warm and soft so it's perfect for chilly days.,46134,3
46134,The package included a pair of socks which was pleasantly surprising.,46134,3
46134,"The only drawback is that I followed the size chart posted online and when I tried on the onesie, it was too baggy and a size too large for me.",46134,3
46134,I'm 5 foot 6 and I ordered the large but I think the medium would've been a better fit.,46134,3
46135,It looks really ancient but the ballot the glob is upside down but I like it anyway,46135,3
46136,Not as cute as you would hope.,46136,3
46136,Since S&H was $10.00 it isn't worth returning it.,46136,3
46137,"Bottoms are not rubber, they are a hard plastic.",46137,3
46137,Not the best basketball shoe.,46137,3
46138,Looked pretty with my wedding dress and covered my shoulders and chest enough for church.,46138,3
46138,I recommend getting a different pin because my broke the morning of the wedding.,46138,3
46138,And I was shedding all over people's suits even though I brushed it and put it through the dryer.,46138,3
46139,I'm a little disappointed.,46139,3
46139,"The material for this jacket seems more raincoat like than leather :/

It fits pretty well though and it seems to be really warm.",46139,3
46139,The zippers are pretty meh and I can see that it might get caught often :/ I really wanted to love it and i was really excited for it but definitely disappointed that it doesn't look much like the picture.,46139,3
46140,I took advice of other reviewers and sized up.,46140,3
46140,I bought a large.,46140,3
46140,"I am 5'9"", 150 lbs.",46140,3
46140,The dress does have decent stretch and I found that it was a bit roomy in the waist area.,46140,3
46140,My arms are maybe longer than average and the sleeves were also short.,46140,3
46140,It fit everywhere else.,46140,3
46140,"Also, the dress is a few inches shorter on me than on the model.",46140,3
46140,I would say that compared to the model the dress is about 3 or 4 inches shorter.,46140,3
46140,I would have preferred it to be the length it is on the model  since that helps to balance out the sexy factor of the dress but I am not going to send it back.,46140,3
46140,"The netted/mesh part of the dress is see-thru so your bosom/bra and some of your butt cheeks will be seen, so be mindful.",46140,3
46140,"Basically, when I put the dress on it looks good, but it doesn't quite mirror the look of the model.",46140,3
46140,"For the price though, it will do.",46140,3
46141,"Cute boot, but I had to return them.",46141,3
46141,I wear between a 7 and 7.5 and these were a 7.5 but still too tight.,46141,3
46141,Not comfortable at all.,46141,3
46141,"I am considering ordering a larger size, but wasn't completely impressed with the overall feel.",46141,3
46142,This was what I expected for the price.,46142,3
46142,I purchased this with the plan of wearing it for one evening as costume jewelry.,46142,3
46142,If it turns or fades after that; I won't be disappointed.,46142,3
46144,I was okay but for the price of it I can deal with it.,46144,3
46145,"The sweater arrived in about two weeks, instead of the projected month.",46145,3
46145,"At first glance it seemed like it was the exact product pictured but alas, not quite.",46145,3
46145,"I ordered this thinking it was an oversized, comfy cardigan I could wear around the house on a crisp day when I had the windows open, but it is actually more fitted then sweater pictured and the sleeves are 3/4 sleeves.",46145,3
46145,They come nowhere near my wrist.,46145,3
46145,"The inside is a little scratchy feeling, but it doesn't bother me.",46145,3
46145,"On the up side, it is warm, and looks good as a day time sweater for the fall, or around the office.",46145,3
46146,"Not very comfortable, but it does seem able to fit a large range of body types.",46146,3
46146,The reason it is not 4.5* product is that it is extremely comfortable around the crotch area and rides up in that area.,46146,3
46146,I still wear this pretty often.,46146,3
46147,very cute nose ring!,46147,3
46147,Only downside was it took a little bit of time to receive the package.,46147,3
46148,"great for the price, workwell",46148,3
46149,My wife love it,46149,3
46150,A little smaller than other places that sell this size.,46150,3
46151,"I ordered one pair of these pants and got charged for 2 pairs and received 2, and these are not the pair i wanted.",46151,3
46151,the are flags like but not the ones pictured.,46151,3
46153,"It is made small, so up another size then your normal size, I still received a few compliments on how nice it is when I wore it.",46153,3
46154,its an ok shirt for the price but not well tailored.,46154,3
46155,I returned this because it was a bit flimsy and I was looking for more structure in a hobo style purse.,46155,3
46155,The zippered compartments were also a little hard to close.,46155,3
46156,I am 5'3 and roughly 120 lbs.,46156,3
46156,I am almost 6 months pregnant.,46156,3
46156,"I bought a size SMALL, and it was absolutely HUGE on me.",46156,3
46156,"Went down to a little pass my knees, and was so loose up top.",46156,3
46156,I thought being 6 months pregnant I would go up a size (I normally wear size XS pre-pregnancy).,46156,3
46156,It was like wearing a blanket.,46156,3
46156,The material is nice.,46156,3
46156,"And looks like the picture, just too big, and didn't fit as expected.",46156,3
46156,Had to return it.,46156,3
46157,It fits really nice and it can be adjusted so it can be higher is the front which is nice.,46157,3
46157,"However, little elastic stands started coming out after the first wash. Now the lace everywhere has little stands all over it.",46157,3
46157,"If you pull them, the lace will start to gather.",46157,3
46157,I haven't had this problem with a different lace tank.,46157,3
46157,Pic was after I trimmed for the first time then after a few more wears and a wash.,46157,3
46158,These are a little larger than expected....,46158,3
46159,"It's pretty and looks nice, but if wearing a wet bathing suit under it, the parts of the suit that touch the material, especially the chest area, show up as ""spots"" on the material until it dries.",46159,3
46160,Dress looks like picture but too large.,46160,3
46161,Order two sizes larger than you normally wear.,46161,3
46161,Color is more an off white than white but i loved the skirt.,46161,3
46161,I normally wear XL but was snug so I  reordered in size 1X and fit about the same.,46161,3
46162,"Pre teen - top too big, bottoms too revealing  Returned",46162,3
46163,I don't know if my baby was born with an enormous head or if these hats are tiny.,46163,3
46163,"Cute patterns and nice quality fabric, probably more suitable to a smaller baby 5-8lbs.",46163,3
46164,The leather quality is not as good as my other Dooney bags.,46164,3
46164,"I ordered the same bag, different color from another source & leather quality with that bag poor as well.",46164,3
46164,Dooney used a very thin leather for this style & the bag will crack.,46164,3
46164,I have the larger bucket bag too.,46164,3
46164,The leather on the larger size is quality.,46164,3
46164,Buy the bigger bag.,46164,3
46165,Adorable fabric and the color pictured is exactly the color you get.,46165,3
46165,Its rather large though however I will keep it as to return costs more than the garment did!,46165,3
46165,The fabric is nice.,46165,3
46165,"I wouldn't think one could swim much in it, more like lounging around the pool but not in it.",46165,3
46166,I like this dress - it's cute - but what I really don't like is that the buttons are sewn closed on the top part of the dress.,46166,3
46166,"It's not like I want my cleavage to hang out, but I'm a 38D and find that because the dress is sewn closed and buttons are put on top of the material as a accessory - it's a little too tight in the chest area for me.",46166,3
46166,I'm going to see if I can have it modified.,46166,3
46166,Otherwise the rest of the dress fit well and the empire line fit exactly under the breast like it should.,46166,3
46167,The top is perfect!,46167,3
46167,Makes me feel secure and sexy.,46167,3
46167,Bottoms were a lot smaller than I felt comfortable wearing.,46167,3
46168,"works great, nice texture and stretch.",46168,3
46168,but the color (i got the red) is not what it looks like to me.,46168,3
46168,"it is FIRE ENGINE RED, like super red.",46168,3
46168,"not a dull, dusty red as i see the picture.",46168,3
46169,Very transparent and no push ups.,46169,3
46169,Color is great though.,46169,3
46170,"Very nice,  but somewhat small and I'm a size 0",46170,3
46171,Shirt shrinks in the wash.,46171,3
46171,"Otherwise, a great shirt.",46171,3
46172,NICE BUT RUNS SMALL.,46172,3
46172,ORDER A SIZE BIGGER THAN YOU WEAR.,46172,3
46174,Somewhat disappointed with this sweater.,46174,3
46174,It honestly does not look much like the picture.,46174,3
46174,The tag says that the material is 65% cotton and 35% polyester.,46174,3
46174,"Well, in truth it looks and feels only like polyester.",46174,3
46174,The material is shiny and slick which is weird for a sweater like this.,46174,3
46174,Wish this product was made with 100% or something of equal quality.,46174,3
46175,Somewhat small for an extra large but I do like the light feel.,46175,3
46176,I love the  dress,46176,3
46177,Comft but eyes were misaligned,46177,3
46178,I took a chance with this item because it looks so cute.,46178,3
46178,Basically you get what you pay for with this item.,46178,3
46178,I'm 5'9 and 140lb.,46178,3
46178,The wrap is right around my body and doesn't hang in a relaxed fit as pictured.,46178,3
46178,I typically wear a size medium so I can see how this wrap would not work for most girls.,46178,3
46178,"Overall, I kept it because it wasn't worth sending back.",46178,3
46178,It would work for a more petite friend.,46178,3
46179,A lot cuter on the photo than in person but for the price I cannot complain.,46179,3
46179,"The white ""undershirt"" part is extremely long and looks a little strange.",46179,3
46179,"Other than that, it's ok...again for the price though, who can complain.",46179,3
46179,It's definitely wearable to the office.,46179,3
46180,I'm giving it to my mother because I'm a bit taller.,46180,3
46180,"I'm 5'7 and my arms are long so just keep that in mind, this is an Asian site so just keep that in mind or look at the sizing.",46180,3
46181,The colors are off...too lavender and a bit pink...not flesh toned.,46181,3
46181,Also the graphic is not centered so the nipples don't line up.,46181,3
46181,"The graphic is also not on the back, like the one in the picture.",46181,3
46181,"I bought this as a gag shirt, just wish it was a bit more accurate.",46181,3
46182,"not quite as vivid as it is shown, however...I believe the image has had the contrast manipulated so that the design appears more bold than it does in actuality.",46182,3
46183,The top was huge and the tail was short.,46183,3
46183,"She still loves it, so I'm happy.",46183,3
46184,very beautiful however I don't have the right body type for this dress.,46184,3
46184,"This is for a taller person, I am only 5'3"" so the back is too long meaning the back zipper puckers which doesn't allow the neckline to lay flat.",46184,3
46184,It also has no stretch to the fabric at all so sitting is a bit uncomfortable.,46184,3
46184,"Those with longer torsos and slender hips/thighs, will fit this style nicely.",46184,3
46184,Very disappointed it didn't work.,46184,3
46185,To tight around the bottom,46185,3
46186,It is thick panty hose.. not what I consider leggings.,46186,3
46186,"Looked nice, but Snags easily so not planning on wearing more than once.",46186,3
46187,It runs somewhat small across my chest area.,46187,3
46187,Isn't as good as I thought it would be.,46187,3
46187,Material is soft and cool.,46187,3
46188,"Decent quality, child has been born yet but so far.",46188,3
46188,Everything seems to be made good.,46188,3
46189,"lightweight material, slightly shorter than expected.",46189,3
46190,AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS....PEOPLE SEEMED UNSURE ABOUT THEIR PROTECTION.....I USED THE RFID SLEEVE YOU PUT YOUR CARD IN TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION...THEN PUT THE CARDS IN MY RFID BLOCKING WALLET....TO DOUBLE SECURITY AND HAVE ADDED PROTECTION FOR MYSELF AGAINST THE CRIMINALS WALKING AND SWIPING MY CARDS....,46190,3
46191,It was shorter than expected,46191,3
46192,"Bead colors were beautiful and beads looked symetrical as promised, but I had to return unopened because one of the tube caps had come off in transit.",46192,3
46192,I will try ordering again.,46192,3
46193,"This shirt was very over sized,like a dress.",46193,3
46194,Not multicam... doesn't match true multicam items,46194,3
46195,"It had puffy shoulders, which didn't show in pics.",46195,3
46195,"also, the color is misleading",46195,3
46196,Fashion Jewellery as expected.,46196,3
46196,"Not the best quality, but okay.",46196,3
46197,"Its a good top tank, but make sure you order 2 size up coz it runs small.",46197,3
46197,"The logo of captain america is made from low quality material,,,i think they could have made it better if they wanted to.",46197,3
46198,I am keeping it but it is too large and does not fit the body like in the picture.,46198,3
46198,It is not cut the same as in the picture.,46198,3
46200,"My daughter loves this..but the metallic fabric rubs off after the first swim, showing the black fabric.",46200,3
46200,It is totally worth the price.,46200,3
46200,And my daughter still uses it.,46200,3
46201,"These are ok, way too short to sleep in.",46201,3
46202,It's a cute shirt.,46202,3
46202,The sleeves however are a little weird.,46202,3
46202,They stick out when I put it on.,46202,3
46202,"It's also very see through, so highly recommended you wear something underneath it.",46202,3
46202,"Overall, it's a cute shirt, just something that I wish I could have tried on before buying.",46202,3
46203,so for so good,46203,3
46204,"Cute earrings,  however,  some stones had fallen off during shipping",46204,3
46205,"(2.5-3)
I really want to rate this higher.",46205,3
46205,"The fact is that it didn't fit right, they run small all of them, and it was a set I really wanted, so to me.",46205,3
46205,"When  ring companies sell the  wrong  size, to me it's not excused.",46205,3
46206,size  was  partly  my  fault,46206,3
46208,"Can't recommend these, very loose on the breasts",46208,3
46209,This is a well made robe but I don't know what kid they are basing the sizing off of.,46209,3
46209,I am a size 0-2 woman and this robe practically fit me.,46209,3
46209,It was way too big and long for a child much more appropriate for a small teenager.,46209,3
46209,"I'm 5'3"" and it was to my knees.",46209,3
46209,I'm going to give the small a shot but I'm not super optimistic.,46209,3
46210,Almost parchment paper like,46210,3
46211,Really cute but way too small it's more like an xxs,46211,3
46212,Yes Just like what is said in the other reviews it was indeed tight in the arms.,46212,3
46212,It was also a little long for me but then again I'm only 5ft tall so it came almost to my knees.,46212,3
46212,But  for what I paid for this I will just alter it instead of sending it back.,46212,3
46212,After all it still serves its purpose.,46212,3
46213,"arms are bright purple/pink, not the burgundy I was expecting",46213,3
46215,The dress was cute and great material for warm weather.,46215,3
46215,I followed the sizing guide and the dress was too small.,46215,3
46215,It fit more like a tunic than a dress.,46215,3
46216,This item was way bigger than expected and the boots didn't stay up.,46216,3
46216,They kept fall off.,46216,3
46216,If items were a little smaller they would of been better.,46216,3
46217,Good quality for the price.,46217,3
46217,"Just like VS, very soft.",46217,3
46218,"Looks goofy, not very cool.",46218,3
46219,"This ""dress"" is cute, however, way too small.",46219,3
46219,I'm 5'6 approximately 150 lbs and it doesn't even come below my bottom.,46219,3
46219,I will keep it to use as a longer shirt though!,46219,3
46220,Only reason I'm not giving five stars is that I ordered them in black.,46220,3
46220,They're not black... they're dark gray.,46220,3
46220,Tsk tsk for lying about product details.,46220,3
46220,Sucks cuz they're cute too...,46220,3
46220,But not the color I paid for.,46220,3
46221,"Quality ok
Cute but run small, I ordered 3x & I wear size12 about 32waist size, & I have slightly wide  hips the shingles may bother u as they move around while in the water",46221,3
46222,A litter bigger than expected.,46222,3
46222,Would look really cute as flair on a bag!,46222,3
46223,"These are a bit small and kind of thin, but look great.",46223,3
46223,Not sure how well they'll hold up over time...,46223,3
46224,WITH A BETTER SIZE .....,46224,3
46224,WOULD BUY AGAIN AT THIS SELLERS!!,46224,3
46225,"Nice ring, nice finish and looks solid.",46225,3
46225,"It comes in a nice pouch and I chose the ceramic as I didn't want to buy a titanium or tungsten ring that will scratch and lose it  ""painted"" black finish..",46225,3
46225,The ceramic in that sense is homogeneous and even scratches will remain black.,46225,3
46225,I will update the review once I wear it a bit though.,46225,3
46225,But I am giving it a 3 stars out of 5 because of the stupid Steven G engraving inside the ring.,46225,3
46225,"It is an unsophisticated, ugly engraving, that is way too big.",46225,3
46225,"If that doesn't bother you, then discount my opinion on that.",46225,3
46225,"I wish the maker could stamp a more stylish, and more importantly, a smaller engraving that doesn't take half the inside of the ring.",46225,3
46225,I would be happy if he doesn't stamp anything...,46225,3
46227,I usually wear large this one was too large and as im in Jordan l cho to bey to tailor and make it much smaller to fit good,46227,3
46228,The hat was to large great service on the return,46228,3
46229,"Love the color and the length but the top did not fit right, it bowed out even though I filled it out....material just didn't lay tight in the top but I will keep.",46229,3
46230,"Not bad, but not really great.",46230,3
46230,The stitching looks and feels cheap.,46230,3
46230,If you are generally broad shouldered go one size larger.,46230,3
46231,"i liked the color online, but its more red than burgundy.",46231,3
46231,also the fabric is heavy and straps are easy to see,46231,3
46232,It's a stretchy material but the bow on the back does not stay like its pictured..,46232,3
46232,It flops down so you can't even tell it's a bow.,46232,3
46233,"Pretty color, very thin, and not as ""floaty"" as it appears in the photo.",46233,3
46234,It's like buying a pair of glasses st Walmart.,46234,3
46234,It's cheap so my expectations weren't to high.,46234,3
46234,Just something to block the sun a little bit.,46234,3
46235,Gave blouse to my neice.,46235,3
46236,I am giving 3 stars only because the seller worked with me in regards to a partial refund.,46236,3
46236,The shirt is very soft but the fit is all wrong.,46236,3
46236,I am 5'3 and 110lbs.,46236,3
46236,I ordered the smallest size and it fit like a mini-dress.,46236,3
46236,There was no way I could utilize this shirt except as a rag.,46236,3
46237,"I'm about 5'4"" and weigh close to 145lbs and I ordered in the US 12, it fits my shoulders and chest very nicely but my gripe is that it's so short!",46237,3
46237,The shirt is wonderful and the short length can be fixed with high-waist shorts or pants.,46237,3
46238,"It's nearly impossible to figure out how to get this thing on, otherwise very cute.",46238,3
46239,"It is a pretty dress, but I am not sure that it is for me.",46239,3
46239,"I lost about 15 pounds, and I want to show it off with  nice dress for prom.",46239,3
46239,"However, I made a few mistakes with this dress.",46239,3
46239,"First, I based my expectation on how the model looks, not how the dress would realistically look on me.",46239,3
46239,The dress on the model for this is not the same dress that they are selling.,46239,3
46239,"Before you buy it, make sure that you see it on the mannequin.",46239,3
46239,It looks different than it does on the model.,46239,3
46239,"Second, the top is very stiff.",46239,3
46239,It does not list this.,46239,3
46239,"The breast areas are also padded, which is not listed, and it is VERY low cut.",46239,3
46239,"With my bust, it is inappropriate to wear something this low cut.",46239,3
46239,"I am also now a size 8-10 with a 12 normally fitting me loosely, and this size 12 that I ordered is a bit tight, so the dress runs small.",46239,3
46239,It also is NOT an empire waist....the skirt of the dress will cut you in half.,46239,3
46239,"As a curvy woman, I do not think that this dress is for me.",46239,3
46240,It's a nice outfit and very light.,46240,3
46240,"I'm 5'8, I have a very small waist, but I also have a big butt it fitted well in my arms but the lower part was too short for my bottom.",46240,3
46240,It was extremely tight and it could rip if I tried to walk or anything.,46240,3
46240,I got a XL sizex even though I usually wear M/L.,46240,3
46240,"However, I'll definitely turn into a bikini cover up or a shirt.",46240,3
46241,"Little small, but I wore it a time or two.",46241,3
46241,May need to order a size larger than your own.,46241,3
46242,"Very nice, but kind of small.",46242,3
46242,Best to get 2 size bigger.,46242,3
46242,Hubby was not too happy.,46242,3
46243,The scrubs are great.,46243,3
46243,I hate the undershirt though.,46243,3
46243,It is very cute but the stars are just glued on and come off very easily and are stiff so they are a little annoying on the skin.,46243,3
46244,"I guess got get what you pay for, so I have only myself to blame.",46244,3
46244,The handles on the small bag started to stretch and tear.,46244,3
46244,The dolly on the medium bag had a tendency to twist.,46244,3
46245,"really cute dress, nice vibrant colors and not thin cheap fabric BUT the zipper broke the first time i tried to wear it and now i have to replace the zipper before i can wear it.",46245,3
46245,i wouldn't purchase again but for $10 it's an alright dress.,46245,3
46247,Like the looks of the shoe; quality seems good.,46247,3
46247,"The shoe size ran a bit small for me, so I am reordering...",46247,3
46248,I am giving this product 3 stars despite the fact that I didn't actually receive the correct product yet.,46248,3
46248,I ordered this slip cover and I received a furniture protector instead.,46248,3
46248,"However, I did also order the slip cover for the couch and that did arrive correctly.",46248,3
46248,The couch one fits perfectly.,46248,3
46248,I ordered grey and it is darker than the grey in the photo which is a bit disappointing (I have a white German shepherd who sheds a lot so I was taking a chance with grey to begin with.,46248,3
46248,Having it darker than expected is a bit of a letdown but I do still like the color).,46248,3
46248,I'm sure the loveseat version will be just as enjoyable once I receive the correct product.,46248,3
46250,"Probably ideal for sun shade working in the garden, but unfashionably broad for social use.",46250,3
46252,But honestly I didn't pay much for it.,46252,3
46252,Fun to wear and not worry about losing or breaking.,46252,3
46253,fit a little smaller than anticipated.,46253,3
46254,"Cute pattern, cotton could be softer, and bummer that it shrinked a lot after first wash.",46254,3
46254,Still like it because of the front snap closure.,46254,3
46256,"once you sweat in these they do fall off, thankfully caught before they ended up on the floor :)",46256,3
46257,Definitely go one size bigger,46257,3
46258,The fit is a little off based on the measurements.,46258,3
46258,In addition the snaps don't stay snapped which makes for a very annoying evening.,46258,3
46259,"I wish you could order separate sizes, the bottom fits but the top is too small.",46259,3
46260,One stone was missing opn my earring when they arrive.,46260,3
46260,Can see the glue where they glued stones in.,46260,3
46261,"cup size is really small as well, I'm guessing B-C cup size for the size 40 bra (the largest).",46261,3
46261,"Pros:
-Cheap
-Comfortable (if it fits)
-Convenient buttons

Cons:
-Cups are small
-Band seems smaller than a typical bra as well",46261,3
46262,"Material is not exactly ...luxury, but fair",46262,3
46263,I love the color and the fit.,46263,3
46263,"However, the shirt is so incredibly cheaply made that I almost did not wear it a first time!",46263,3
46263,You can hold the shirt up and see where it is thinner in spots than others.,46263,3
46263,I'll spend more money on higher quality next time.,46263,3
46264,"Cute shirt, buy larger no wiggle room.",46264,3
46266,"The shirt fit me nicely, but I got a XXL and I normally wear a M. Also, I didn't even receive the watch with it, which was a major disappointment in my eyes.",46266,3
46266,"Other than that, I love it.",46266,3
46266,"The material is a little uncomfortable, and fades after the first wash, but it's still a beautiful shirt.",46266,3
46267,This watch is meant for older girls > 11 years old.,46267,3
46267,Watch face is big.,46267,3
46267,It gets easily dirty so not appropriate for girls who likes to play at the park all the time.,46267,3
46267,All in all its a really cute item and even I would wear it.,46267,3
46267,Would have loved it if they have it in a smaller size for younger kids.,46267,3
46267,My 6 year old and 4 year old girls wanted it but it was just way too big on them.,46267,3
46268,I was expecting better quality,46268,3
46269,Its tight as it should be.,46269,3
46269,"The top part rolls down to mid stomach so, you have to keep unrolling it to the top.",46269,3
46269,"If you sit or lay, its gets even worse.",46269,3
46270,My grandson loves the shoes but usb port only lasted a week on the shoes,46270,3
46271,These leg warmers were longer than expected so they ended up scrunched up the one time my daughter wore them.,46271,3
46271,I am going to wait about a year to try them again and hopefully the length won't be an issue.,46271,3
46271,"The material seemed delicate to me, so delicate that I would use a lingerie bag to wash them.",46271,3
46272,Looks good so far.,46272,3
46273,They are a tad larger than I typically wear.,46273,3
46273,They are cute but I was unaware when I bought them that the heel is silver.,46273,3
46273,I don't like that so much and am not sure if I would wear them be yhe silver makes them look a little cheap.,46273,3
46274,RAN TIGHT BUT VERY NICE,46274,3
46275,Did not love these underwear.,46275,3
46275,The holes for the legs are tight and that is not something I have ever had issues before with underwear.,46275,3
46275,Just not super comfortable.,46275,3
46276,"Thin fabric, but looks nice after ironing.",46276,3
46278,These are nice but they fade quickly and wear down just as fast.,46278,3
46279,I like the design but the front of the hat is rather tight.,46279,3
46279,Wish there was a sizing chart to avoid problems like this.,46279,3
46280,I didn't expect a lot considering the price.,46280,3
46280,It's cute but the sleeves are tight,46280,3
46281,I thought this would be more like chiffon material (maybe I shouldve read more closely) but it's more of like a stretchy bathing suit material.,46281,3
46281,It's still cute though and I wore it to a bridal shower but I have to say I'm not very motivated to wear it again any time soon.,46281,3
46282,The print started to disintegrate after the first wash.,46282,3
46283,These are good in some ways: nice zipper pulls and bright color.,46283,3
46283,"But the mesh is scratchy and the fabric is thinner than my other packing cubes (Ebags, IKEA an Hynes) and without any lining.",46283,3
46283,I am returning them to try another set.,46283,3
46284,Great image but it runs really small for the size i bought.,46284,3
46284,Kind of dissapointed because it stops me from wearing it.,46284,3
46284,Besides that great shirt,46284,3
46285,Some did not fit as expected and all of those rings in the picture did not come with it,46285,3
46286,the wallet is of great quality and very functional.,46286,3
46286,"The clutch is very poor quality, i just threw it away.",46286,3
46287,It was way way smaller and thinner than I expected.,46287,3
46287,Probably my fault for not reading the description properly.,46287,3
46288,Don't mind it would buy again,46288,3
46289,You get what you paid for.,46289,3
46290,It's very bright hot pink.,46290,3
46290,It's all stuck together with glue so you won't want to leave it on your baby for any real length of time.,46290,3
46290,One of the pieces on the bra was off when it arrived so I had to hot glue it together and all of the edges needed to be ironed down.,46290,3
46290,My friend liked it (it was a present) but I haven't seen any pictures of the baby in it yet so....,46290,3
46291,"Nice material, but more dotted than expected.",46291,3
46291,Not flattering at this size.,46291,3
46292,It was too short for me.,46292,3
46292,I am 5'7 and when I tried it on the medium it was like an ultimate wedgy.,46292,3
46293,Beautiful- but squeeky-  I've never had a bra make noise before?!,46293,3
46293,Unable to wear as I flet like I needed to spray down with wd40 - not sure how this is possible,46293,3
46294,"Overall shape and look is good, and I received multiple compliments while wearing them.",46294,3
46294,The temple is a little short for me and the plastic that covers the rim cracked after a few uses.,46294,3
46294,These glasses are okay for the price.,46294,3
46295,It's cute but saying it runs small is an understatement.,46295,3
46295,I usually wear a M/L and so I ordered a XXL based on reviews and it was still too small!,46295,3
46296,It took me forever to get untangled.,46296,3
46296,I wanted to use as a Christmas gift but I believe I will be sending it back.,46296,3
46297,"After less than a week stones fell out and shortly afterwards, the silver coating started to peel off.",46297,3
46297,Its a pretty ring Maybe i just recieved a bad ring.,46297,3
46297,I do wished it had lasted longer.,46297,3
46298,It works and is pretty comfortable.,46298,3
46298,They sent me the wrong one (i got Sebastian from black Butler) but I like the show so it's okay,46298,3
46299,I always buy the same size this ones came to large,46299,3
46300,"The hoodie is definitely badass, but i wanted and received a XXL that fit like an XL.",46300,3
46300,The hoodie was too awesome to return so i made it a Christmas gift.,46300,3
46301,"Exactly like photo, except for one thing.",46301,3
46301,I'm not sure it's leather.,46301,3
46301,Smells like vinyl or PVC.,46301,3
46303,Liked about half of the selection in the 6 pck.,46303,3
46304,"Thought this was a ""sweater"" but is more like a t-shirt material..It fits fine but was very reasonably priced, so I kept it...",46304,3
46306,Doesn't fit slouchy like in picture even after I bought a size up.,46306,3
46307,"The material is indeed very thin, but not too see-through, and will be nice and light in the summer.",46307,3
46307,"I was hoping it would be a more substantial fabric, but it's a lighter satin-type material.",46307,3
46307,"I love the bold color, but I wish the dress were lined (undergarments were visible in the white areas of the dress).",46307,3
46307,"I ordered to fit my bust, so it's a little loose at the actual bust line, but it's tight just above that at the upper chest.",46307,3
46307,It also has a facing that needs to be tacked in.,46307,3
46307,"My dress came with a little red belt that will need to be dress-taped to stay put, but for the price this was an okay buy.",46307,3
46307,"It may be an option for summer dinners and outings, but it wasn't quite what I was hoping for.",46307,3
46308,"I liked the ability to get so many different colors and styles for the price, however the quality is definitely lacking.",46308,3
46308,I have already killed at least five of them by either over tightening and breaking it  or undertightening and loosing it.,46308,3
46308,They also came with different length barbells which can either be good or frustrating depending on what you want out of them.,46308,3
46308,"Two of them, however, I have had in for a couple of weeks and they have worked really well for me.",46308,3
46308,The trick is not gripping them too hard and breaking them.,46308,3
46308,"The metal is also very cheap, but I do not have sensitive skin so it works pretty well for me.",46308,3
46309,This product was great in theory.,46309,3
46309,"When I got mine it was perfectly straight, after one use it became uneven, the bar that holds the clasp together became bent.",46309,3
46309,I also have a smaller wrist then the sizes that come with it so I had to go past the predetermined sizes.,46309,3
46309,After a week it will randomly pop off of my wrist causing my pebble time to fall off my wrist and hit the floor.,46309,3
46309,It didn't come with pins (Had to take some off a watch I no longer was using.),46309,3
46309,"Other then that this band is great, I like how it doesn't feel cheap, it doesn't cause my wrist to sweat like the original PT band did.",46309,3
46310,One feather came off in shipping a second came off during initial handling.,46310,3
46310,"Not too difficult to re-attach, but it was disappointing to have to fix something brand new.",46310,3
46310,"For the price, it does look very nice on.",46310,3
46310,The size is just right.,46310,3
46311,"As described, but not attractive on me.",46311,3
46311,"The photo was a bit misleading bc the photo earrings look glossy and like it would go well with hematite pieces, but in person, they look like what they are: cheap, dark-colored metal.",46311,3
46311,At least they didn't cost much.,46311,3
46312,First it fits me perfectly.,46312,3
46312,This is super comfortable as well.,46312,3
46312,I give it just 3 stars because sometimes i think i hear a tearing sound when i put it on or take it off and this isn't too tight on me so i'm not struggling to put it on or take it off.,46312,3
46312,It makes me wonder if it'll last more than one season.,46312,3
46312,"Also, when swimming the skirt tends to raise up, high.",46312,3
46312,the panty part is striped like the top so it matches it's just irritating.,46312,3
46312,"With all that said, I would still buy it and will probably buy it again.",46312,3
46315,Very thin material that is kind of cheap but it is cute.,46315,3
46316,They were a lot larger than expected/ I have the zip up to match the sweats an that fits perfectly / but the sweat pants I have to tighten 95% just to fit me / so they are on the larger side for size Medium,46316,3
46317,Really not a very comfortable feeling garment.,46317,3
46317,The fabric is not very soft.,46317,3
46317,Maybe it will feel better after it has been washed.,46317,3
46318,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarleton-Large-Satchel-H106808-Beige/dp/B00BSI8GY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarleton Large Satchel H106808 - Beige</a>
Its more brown than beige really.",46318,3
46318,it will be useful when I travel.,46318,3
46318,Moderate size without being so large it weighs you down!,46318,3
46319,I read the other reviews that said this ran small and I believe they were correct.,46319,3
46320,I've purchased this brand before and these are smaller than the other styles I got last year.,46320,3
46320,I am going to have to order up a size.,46320,3
46320,I ordered a size up and while there is plenty of room in the length (they're a bit long) the real issue is that the straps bubble away from my foot.,46320,3
46320,"I have high arches, so this is rarely a problem.",46320,3
46320,"They're cute shoes, and I wish I could have made them work.",46320,3
46320,I ordered the cream of the style I purchased last year.,46320,3
46321,Comfy but my feet get sweaty when working in these crocs due to no ventilation.,46321,3
46321,"I cut my own holes for air flow and my feet thanked me, no more soggy sock feet.",46321,3
46321,As a former foot model I think these are very good design for working kitchen or slip resistant environments,46321,3
46322,"the bottom fits good,but the top is WAY too blousy.",46322,3
46322,"The material really wrinkles, so haven't ironed it to see how it fits when hanging well.",46322,3
46322,"Cute and will probably still wear, but with a short slip since the slit it pretty high.",46322,3
46323,Better quality than expected and comfortable.,46323,3
46323,"However, the straps are positioned very wide on the bra so they slide down very easily on the shoulder.",46323,3
46323,Could be my petite frame.,46323,3
46323,Would like this better in a racerback so the straps would stay put.,46323,3
46325,"The ThinOPTICS are amazing, but this case is thin and will NOT protect your phone.",46325,3
46325,Returning to get the adhesive ThinOPTICS - they are amazing!,46325,3
46326,But it was too smakl so I wear it as a shirt instead,46326,3
46327,looks better on the picture.,46327,3
46327,A little too gray.,46327,3
46328,I don't like the material.,46328,3
46328,The acrylic is nasty smells bad and sheds all over the place.,46328,3
46328,Looked for an affordable linen or wool one tht was messianic but could not find one.,46328,3
46328,That being said it is nice to have one,46328,3
46329,"It's a very cute item but it runs quite small, so be forewarned.",46329,3
46329,Also the snaps are hard to fasten with a wriggly baby.,46329,3
46329,We got exactly one wear out of this.,46329,3
46330,Couldn't decide how many stars to give this.,46330,3
46330,".The color, sizing and length is great but it is so see-through!",46330,3
46330,"Even with a sort of short slip built in inside of it, you can see through both layers.",46330,3
46330,"Like the style, but I feel the pictures were dishonest about the actual product.",46330,3
46331,I've worn a few jeggings and the material is too thin to even be leggings.,46331,3
46331,Aesthetically ok but EXTREMELY unflattering.,46331,3
46331,It's not thick or tight enough to provide any help in the body shape control area.,46331,3
46331,It provides less support than stockings.,46331,3
46331,"Works ok with a girdle or shape wear, but that defeats the purpose of wearing jeggings for the comfort of leggings.",46331,3
46332,Tight across my chest.,46332,3
46333,They are too small.,46333,3
46333,At least for me.,46333,3
46334,"The hat fits just a tad big on me, the flower was falling off so i'll have to use a glue gun and reattach.",46334,3
46334,It also came smushed and I have yet to get the creases out of the brim.,46334,3
46335,It seem to have flattering fit.,46335,3
46335,"If the pockets were real, I would replace mine with on of a larger size.",46335,3
46336,"When I got it in November, I was stoked.",46336,3
46336,It's light but very warm.,46336,3
46336,Now that it's January and the weather is getting cooler I have been able to wear it...,46336,3
46336,Within the first few uses the patches fell off and I just noticed one of the pockets were coming undone....,46336,3
46336,"Very sad that it's fall apart so soon, but for the price it's to be expected...",46336,3
46337,its really just a piece of fur material,46337,3
46338,The picture is far better than the product.,46338,3
46338,They look and feel fake.,46338,3
46338,Highly dissatisfied & disappointed.,46338,3
46340,I like the jumpsuit but it is too small for me.,46340,3
46341,It's pretty big but with enough strength you can bend it in a little.,46341,3
46341,"And it looks a little cheap, but not really",46341,3
46342,THE RED BLED ONTO THE WHITE ON THE BOOT COVERS,46342,3
46343,These wore out rather quickly compared to just about every other sock we have in a family of 5.,46343,3
46345,"lleg hoy,ms tarde de lo previsto",46345,3
46346,slightly seethrough so definitely wear pure white underwear and it's a little short but other then that it's not too bad.,46346,3
46347,I really like but it's  kinda flat in the back which makes my head from the side view look weird,46347,3
46348,A little big but very pretty,46348,3
46350,Somewhat small and threads were not stretchy for people with larger butts.,46350,3
46350,When I pulled them up I felt a bunch of threads break.,46350,3
46351,Was not the size I asked for but did not feel like sending it back so keep drying it hoping it will shrink.,46351,3
46351,Other them that it is a very nice bathing suit,46351,3
46352,very cute but not comfortable at all.,46352,3
46353,I really like the fit and initially really liked the fabric for being so soft.,46353,3
46353,The fabric is really not great in the end because of the way it holds odors.,46353,3
46353,"After one wear, by the end of the day, my crotch reeks.",46353,3
46353,"I'd love to update you on the post-wash quality, but the stench really dampens my enjoyment of these briefs.",46353,3
46353,"Sure, I've smelled my odor with other briefs but this set really amps up the stink level.",46353,3
46354,Very cute but I did have a few complains.,46354,3
46354,The ribbon bows on the leggings are not even tied into bows and they don't look all that great.,46354,3
46354,And the pink nose on the cow is just sawn on top of the cows face so the black cow spots show through the pink fabric and it makes it look like it's stained.,46354,3
46354,I bought the 3-6 month size and it's more like 6-9 months.,46354,3
46354,The sawing is done nicely though and I feel like it's a good fabric.,46354,3
46354,I planned on buying all four colors in all different sizes because i thought they were so cute but I probably won't by another one.,46354,3
46355,Alil bit shiny compared to the pic but it's still great,46355,3
46356,I think that their idea of an XL is like a size 12.,46356,3
46356,These pants are way too small which is hard to do with spandex.,46356,3
46357,"they aren't blue ... what came was actually black with a blue inset (not as pictured) while the quality and cut are questionable .. XXXL size does seem to be correct for 34"" waist",46357,3
46359,Run small in the neck and arms.,46359,3
46360,Too big for be L,46360,3
46361,The 3 stars is for the style and material  but the fit is small.,46361,3
46361,I ordered large and I looked like a butter ball wrapped in denim.,46361,3
46361,"I think I if I were 99 lbs I would have looked great in it, but most 5'6, small to medium-sized women, like me, are not.",46361,3
46361,Also the roll-up sleeve was missing a button.,46361,3
46362,decent but has no room for anything but the cards.,46362,3
46362,thought i might be able to keep a bit of cash inside with the cards but then the case doesn't close.,46362,3
46362,"meh, not bad - just don't expect anything but space for 5 cards.",46362,3
46363,Have not worn it yet.,46363,3
46363,Not made very sturdy,46363,3
46364,With a few alterations i will be able to wear it .,46364,3
46364,Love the quality and material.,46364,3
46365,"is beautiful, but the fastener leaves a lot to be desired, it falls off, regularly, it needs a magnet closure, or another closure.",46365,3
46365,"otherwise, would be amazing.",46365,3
46366,"Had to return this because it was too tight at the bottom, around the top of the thighs/legs, despite measurements on the package.",46366,3
46367,came erlier than expected ' ordered a 12/14 im about 149 .,46367,3
46367,everything fits well warm on the inside,46367,3
46368,"It wasn't exactly small, but it wemt to my calfs.",46368,3
46368,Not my ankles like in the picture.,46368,3
46368,Disappointed but still keeping them.,46368,3
46369,"Cute idea for a bathing suit, however, it is not made with quality fabric.",46369,3
46369,The fit is a little funky like most everyone says.,46369,3
46369,I ended up returning it,46369,3
46370,Overall look of the watch is great but whether the internal mechanisms of the watch will last still needs sometime to monitor .,46370,3
46370,Have worn the watch for the past three days and movements of the hands always stop halfway and I need to rewind it again.,46370,3
46370,Purposes of watch is to read the time no point wearing it if it stop working even it looks great.,46370,3
46370,Will stop wearing the watch if this goes on.,46370,3
46371,The sizes are a lot smaller than I was lead to think.,46371,3
46371,Best to order next size no matter what you might think.,46371,3
46372,This bra is tremendously huge!,46372,3
46372,"It is unwearable as is, I plan to alter it BC I threw away the packaging accidentally.",46372,3
46373,I love this top but the sizing is smaller than expected...definitely go a size or two up,46373,3
46374,Too much work with all the strings.,46374,3
46374,Cute and decent quality...,46374,3
46374,I returned only because I was just too lazy with the hassle of all the strings.,46374,3
46375,I got the pink blazer.,46375,3
46375,"The product is a lot more of a vibrant pink than the blazer in the photo, which appears to be a softer pink.",46375,3
46375,"Also, the checkered pattern on the product is larger than the one in the photo, which I think doesn't look as flattering.",46375,3
46375,The lining inside isn't very secure and makes it difficult to put my arms into the blazer because the fabric keeps bunching up.,46375,3
46375,"Also, the button came off when I first put it on.",46375,3
46375,"I do think it looks cute though, I just think the quality could be improved.",46375,3
46376,"For bigger bust the straps are very thin, no support but cute!",46376,3
46377,The elephant is exactly the size I thought it would be.,46377,3
46377,"The detail & rhinestones are cute-- however, I am not able to wear it, yet, because it arrived with a broken chain.",46377,3
46377,I'm not even sure how it was even possible that it was broken in so many places.,46377,3
46377,The chain had at least 3 breaks.,46377,3
46377,"I was possibly considering replacing the chain, anyway- but it sucks that it arrived damaged.",46377,3
46378,"The shirt fits well, but is made of very thin fabric.",46378,3
46378,The cream color is see-through; I had to return it.,46378,3
46378,"Other, darker colors are fine.",46378,3
46378,This review is for the cream color; I would give a higher star level to other colors.,46378,3
46379,Nice material but too small,46379,3
46381,Not the same design at all!,46381,3
46382,Was to big for me.,46382,3
46382,Ended up giving it to my daughter.,46382,3
46383,Lovely shoes however way too small I wear a 9 and order 10 and still fit small.,46383,3
46383,I would not recommend it for persons with wide.,46383,3
46383,It would fit a small and straight feet persons perfectly.,46383,3
46384,"Within 2 days of use, the Velcro on the left sandal detached.",46384,3
46384,"Since I was leaving on a vacation, I fixed that with crazy glue.",46384,3
46384,"After using it on and off for 10 more days, the Velcro on the right side sandal detached.",46384,3
46384,Sandal is comfortable with good arch support but too wide in the front even with max adjustment.,46384,3
46385,"Like it, but a little pricey for no more than what it is",46385,3
46386,The bracelet is nice but began to come apart after a few weeks.,46386,3
46387,It fit wide wise but was extremely short.,46387,3
46387,"I'm 5'7"" and asked for an XL.",46387,3
46388,"I had to send mine back as it was very tight when inserting into the drone connectors and I felt like it was going to break the connector inside, not willing to take that chance so I never even finished plugging it in.",46388,3
46388,The battery also would not fit in my third party charger (dual battery charger) which to me indicates that the connectors must not be in just the right spot to fit both the charger and the drone.,46388,3
46388,"I have no issues with the stock batteries in the drone or the charger as well as some other third party batteries (Venom, MorPilot) so I suspect poor quality control during manufacturing since some people seem to have no issues with theirs.",46388,3
46388,Going to have to send this one back and just use the others I have since there is no replacement option for this through Amazon.,46388,3
46388,I have giving 3 stars since the seller promptly responded to my message and after asking for pictures (not sure why they need pics since I could not show the connector not aligning due to the battery compartment being completely enclosed) they sent me a return label and they say they will refund me when the item is received.,46388,3
46389,Cute shirt but sizing is off - runs bigger.,46389,3
46389,I'm usually a 12 but returned and ordered a 10.,46389,3
46389,Material is also on the thinner/see through side - will be good for summer.,46389,3
46391,beautiful corset but i ordered it abit small will prolly order it again,46391,3
46392,A nice blouse but it is too large.,46392,3
46392,Cannot return for a smaller size without paying shipping fees which are more than the cost of the item.,46392,3
46393,"Doesn't smell, but sheds EVERYWHERE.",46393,3
46393,"I think that's a typical boa though, hence an average rating.",46393,3
46393,It is very yellow.,46393,3
46394,product ran small and had problems with getting credit from reseller but did finally,46394,3
46395,"My friend really like this present, but the fit is off.",46395,3
46395,"Would have returned it, but the policy was only for 30 days and we had a late gift exchange.",46395,3
46395,"Long story short, I would purchase it again if it were cheaper.",46395,3
46398,"The bottoms fit great but the top, the straps were way to big even after adjusting as tight I can make it.",46398,3
46398,The stitching was messy...I want to say I would buy again but I cannot even contact the seller to exchange the size!,46398,3
46399,"Just a bit too small, but nothing losing some weight will help with",46399,3
46400,Great product/print and color.,46400,3
46400,"However, should have ordered a larger size as it did not fit after wash and dryer.",46400,3
46400,Should have maybe air dried.,46400,3
46401,"Great purchase, I truly recommended!",46401,3
46402,It's a brighter pink than expected.,46402,3
46402,Also was a ton of fabric which made it difficult for the summer wedding I was in.,46402,3
46402,"However, it's affordable and I was able to get it altered to fit my needs.",46402,3
46403,"I'd rate these as 'ok' for some kind of Steampunk costume play, but can't recommend them for daily wear.",46403,3
46403,They're comfortable on the face.,46403,3
46403,But both the clear glasses and the tinted lenses each introduce a minor optical distortion that makes them uncomfortable if you're sensitive to such things.,46403,3
46404,"The main body of the sweater fits perfectly, but I was disappointed that the arms are unevenly fitted, where one is uncomfortably snug and one is ""normal"".",46404,3
46405,This romper runs WAY large.,46405,3
46405,"I have ordered other rompers before in 1X and when I ordered this one in XL I thought (based on the reviews) it would fit a little loose, meaning you have wiggle room.",46405,3
46405,"The XL fits at least like a 2X, maybe even a 3X.",46405,3
46405,"I wish I had ordered at least one size smaller, it would have still fit loose, but would have been much more flattering.",46405,3
46405,"I do LOVE the material though, it is very soft.",46405,3
46405,This will now be my knock around outfit because it is so comfortable :),46405,3
46406,I'm giving these shoes 3 stars because they are a nice quality and quite pretty.,46406,3
46406,Unfortunately they didn't work on my feet.,46406,3
46406,"Maybe they were narrow, though I don't have wide feet, because my pinky toes went between the straps when I walked.",46406,3
46406,The heel strap was too loose and was not adjustable.,46406,3
46406,And the side strap rubbed against my foot and felt rough.,46406,3
46406,Perhaps if your foot were shaped differently they would work for you.,46406,3
46406,I have several pairs of Rieker Reginas from years past in 41 and 42 not sure why these didn't fit properly.,46406,3
46406,I typically wear a size 10 in US shoes.,46406,3
46407,I expected the canvas material to be more course.,46407,3
46408,This product is okay.,46408,3
46408,"I ordered one for my size but the hat is smaller than what is shown, the tail is also smaller than what's shown, and the corset w/ skirt wasn't too much of a problem, but once again, the skirt was a bit smaller than it's shown as well.",46408,3
46408,"If you want a size that will fit and look like what you see, purchase one of these one size bigger than what you'd usually get.",46408,3
46409,Cheap material but the price is cheap as well.,46409,3
46409,"I am usually a small (5'2"" 110 lbs) but it was a little tight on me.",46409,3
46409,Definitely order a size up!,46409,3
46409,It's still a cute shirt though,46409,3
46410,Ok so my baby looked ADORABLE in this suit.,46410,3
46410,Everybody commented on it.,46410,3
46410,But I bought the 3-6 month size for him (he is 5 months) and it just didn't fit!,46410,3
46410,"I had to leave the pants open b/c every time because If I tried to button them, they would just pop open (luckily he is a baby!).",46410,3
46410,It was also a super pain to put on b/c its just one piece.,46410,3
46410,My baby is not abnormally large or anything either - in fact he is only in the fifth percentile for weight and 20% percentile for height.,46410,3
46411,These are really nice and look well made but unfortunately they smell like some kind of chemical almost like a gasoline.,46411,3
46411,I'm running them through the wash a second time with vinegar and ammonia hoping it gets rid of it.,46411,3
46412,The sizing is all over the place.,46412,3
46412,It recommeds going up a size so i went from a medium to a large.,46412,3
46412,The sleeves fit extremely tight while the chest balloons.,46412,3
46412,The cuffs are the worst part.,46412,3
46412,They have very little elasticity and aren't easily rolled up.,46412,3
46412,It is just a poor fit all around.,46412,3
46412,"The plus side is that quality is there for sure, and shipping is reliable.",46412,3
46412,The red is a bit more orange than I liked though.,46412,3
46413,I ordered these for my boyfriend and did not look closely enough at the pictures.,46413,3
46413,The swimsuit is 4 different colors; red and navy blue on the front and the teal and royal blue on the back.,46413,3
46413,"Although the colors are odd, he ended up keeping it because the fit was great.",46413,3
46414,Was just a bit smaller than expected.,46414,3
46415,I wear a  Xl so I ordered XXL and it was too small.,46415,3
46416,"Looks to much like a prom dress, but if that's what you want it for buy it.",46416,3
46417,It is very pretty but would consider this more a 'juniors' style/fit.,46417,3
46417,It fit but it is very form fitting.,46417,3
46417,I wanted something that didn't cling as much.,46417,3
46417,It is now on it's way back for a refund.,46417,3
46418,Like the feel of the thong but it was too small,46418,3
46419,I feel that the pocket on the bib should be in front instead of back and have to turn it to the front,46419,3
46420,It was beautiful but I ended up returning it because the band was a little too small and slightly uncomfortable since it doesn't have any elastic or stretch.,46420,3
46421,I actually really like the lace-up front design and the metallic side zips.,46421,3
46421,"It'll be a perfect add-on to a hot clubbing wardrobe, IF it is of the length as shown in the photo.",46421,3
46421,"Unfortunately it's just TOO short and TOO small, pretty much the size of a boybrief style panty.",46421,3
46421,"I have a narrow hip (jeans size 26) and not much back assets, and I read the reviews and decided to go w a medium.",46421,3
46421,"But still unexpectedly small--barely fit my hip in (the lace design allows some flexibility), and could cover 3/4 of my butt.",46421,3
46421,I would not expect a larger size would help bc of the design--it's just cut to be inappropriately short to wear outside.,46421,3
46421,Can only wear it at home to tease your partner or narcissisate yourself.,46421,3
46421,(Didn't take a photo for my review coz it's pretty much underwear).,46421,3
46422,Material very thin....almost silky like.,46422,3
46422,Not ideal for cold winter nights.,46422,3
46423,Look cool .but disappointed how thin and small they don't go over the calf,46423,3
46424,They come in handy.,46424,3
46424,I was really looking forward to these.,46424,3
46424,Unfortunately as I was opening one up it instantly broke down the middle.,46424,3
46427,I went a size up but the torso is still very small.,46427,3
46427,I'm 5'2 and it barely fits me.,46427,3
46428,It was short after closed on neck.,46428,3
46429,"Light, easy to use.",46429,3
46429,"However, after only a few usages, one of the stretchers came off and poked a hole on the plastic arc.",46429,3
46431,Looks cute but it was way too short.,46431,3
46431,You will be showing you underwear when raising your hand.,46431,3
46431,I paired it with black leggings seem fine.,46431,3
46431,I wish it could have been 2-3 inches longer so I could wear without the leggings on summertime.,46431,3
46432,Comfortable but a bit thin.,46432,3
46432,Could see panty lines so I would wear this as lounge wear only.,46432,3
46433,Very thin & skimpy but cool for hot weather.,46433,3
46434,"The product looks good and is functional however, the packaging of the product is lacklustre.",46434,3
46435,The cuffs are not snug.,46435,3
46435,"The crotch is extremely large, as though it were made for an elephant, but still pretty comfortable.",46435,3
46435,Not exactly as I thought I was getting but I still like them,46435,3
46436,I fit in a size 40 on all other oants however Carhartt pants always run small,46436,3
46437,I like the material,46437,3
46438,The body is georgeous but the neck looks like maybe some effort should have been put into planning the neck.,46438,3
46439,Order size up from your usual size,46439,3
46440,It is super warm which I love.,46440,3
46440,"However, I don't have a large head for a girl and it's still somewhat overly snug.",46440,3
46440,But it helps hide bad hair days so I'm okay with that.,46440,3
46441,"The quality isn't that great,",46441,3
46442,The glue does not work.,46442,3
46443,Not exactly what I was expecting.,46443,3
46443,It's a little cap rather than a bandanna where you would tie it.,46443,3
46443,It will work for a costume but will need hair pins to secure it.,46443,3
46444,The suit is a beautiful color and great material.,46444,3
46444,The fit is large at the top - gaping under the arm and at the top as if it needs elastic enhancement.,46444,3
46444,"Also, the material blouses at the bottom piece in the front so it makes it look bunched up.",46444,3
46445,fit somewhat small in waist compared to other pants of same size...maybe they will stretch...or shrink with washing,46445,3
46446,"Not as expected, very bulky for a child and poor quality.",46446,3
46446,But price is reasonable for product.,46446,3
46447,Look too cheap for the price.,46447,3
46448,"Shipping was super fast, it's super sparkly.",46448,3
46448,It came in a nice box...I love the size of the stone.,46448,3
46448,"If you're into ""big and flashy"" this ring is for you.",46448,3
46448,I love that it won't ever tarnish or rust.,46448,3
46448,"I've gotten so many compliments on it, I was just disappointed when I put it on....I can usually fit a size 7 in rings but this one was loose on my finger and it came with a missing stone.",46448,3
46448,The center stone at the top of the ring is a little loose and I'm hoping it's secure enough to stay and not fall out.,46448,3
46448,"I put a photo of the ring  and where the stone was missing, clearly it's gourgeous!",46448,3
46448,There are just some problems but all in all not bad..,46448,3
46449,size was somewhat as expected... but the quality and stitches aint good...,46449,3
46450,"eh...needs a heel piece, not just the toe....slip and slide too easy...BUT...cheap, ahd much much better than nothing...I carry these in glove box for emergency use...",46450,3
46451,I'm a pre pregnancy size 16 maybe an 18-20 now 3 weeks post.,46451,3
46451,I ordered an XL and it was far too large.,46451,3
46451,Have to order the large soon and I'm sure that will fit much better.,46451,3
46452,"It fit the person I bought it for, but it was snug on her.",46452,3
46452,I think for the size I got it should have been a tad bit bigger.,46452,3
46453,The bottoms don't cover enough whatsoever.,46453,3
46453,They ride SO low.,46453,3
46453,"Also, the top runs big so it's impossible to get the perfect size when you can't order separate sizes for each piece.",46453,3
46453,Wish it worked out cause it is cute.,46453,3
46454,The reason for the 3 stars...is....it is beautiful...but when you touch it ...it is so prickly.,46454,3
46454,I put fingernail polish on it to help...and it does..Stones are pretty..,46454,3
46455,Arrived on time but was too small,46455,3
46456,"Flattering cut, very feminine, though rather long on me at 5'4"".",46456,3
46456,I didn't keep the gray because it was lined in olive and the total effect was more military drab than I hoped.,46456,3
46456,"Great customer service, though!",46456,3
46457,The dress itself looks very little like the dress pictured.,46457,3
46457,The back is plain zip up (not like picture lace up back) The lace is more off white than silver and the sleeves are not right.,46457,3
46457,(they are smaller at the seam and mine were way to long) The length of the dress on me is 2 inches above the knee (wish it was as pictured).,46457,3
46457,The stiff bra padding was way overkill!,46457,3
46457,I loved the cardigan but the shoulders were not wide enough apart.,46457,3
46457,I ended up buying another dress for my sons wedding.,46457,3
46457,"I am 5'9"" 165 lbs.",46457,3
46457,ordered a size 14 and sent my measurements.,46457,3
46458,"bought this the same time with
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OEFGK3S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
unfortunately must return 1st choice as the inner fabrics is rough, hurting my skin
(especially chest area, nips)

keeping this even though not 1st choice but this at least comfortable, soft to my skin
inner fabrics seems made with cotton spandex,, that's the key
sizing: true to size on my end, my true size is xs - small (clothing, us women size), 5 in junior size
getting this in medium to cater my ballet's wardrobe (jarik/long fabrics etc.",46458,3
46458,"wear this outside instead of inside like those who use it as waist trainer)
yes, bought this not for waist trainer but for my ballet's wardrobe
boning is flimsy but they are metal, spiral steel, test them with magnet

why only 3 stars, the style, not really into the 1/4 cups with lace up
but keeping it for day to day, practice only (javanese classical ballet dance)
and took out the front lace already
keep searching for replacing my sturdy 3 decades full coverage cotton corset",46458,3
46459,"Runs quite small.. bought a large to be safe, still too small.",46459,3
46460,its a tee shirt,46460,3
46461,"Quality great, but preemie size is more like a 3-6 mos.",46461,3
46461,Babies won't be using these for months.,46461,3
46462,"There are NO POCKETS, very disappointed",46462,3
46463,This is a pretty dress but the sizes are WAY off!,46463,3
46463,"I normally wear a Medium (10/12, 36D) but, based on the comments, I ordered an XL.",46463,3
46463,I barely got it over my head!,46463,3
46463,This could work for a child but not an adult.,46463,3
46463,The material is a little thin also.,46463,3
46463,But it is very cute.,46463,3
46464,Fits true to size but neck hole is really big a loose.,46464,3
46464,From picture in looked like it would tighter..it's not.,46464,3
46465,Looks good but it was way too big.,46465,3
46466,Looked like the picture but if you are above the heights of 5'6 or have long legs it's hooked short,46466,3
46467,They are cut VERY SMALL.,46467,3
46468,it's ok but too small,46468,3
46469,"It's a nice dress, but the top part is starting to rip at the seam.",46469,3
46469,Which wouldn't be that big of an issue if it wasn't right in the front :/,46469,3
46470,Looks way too big for a newborn but should make a cute keepsake.,46470,3
46470,Mine has writing started already though so I hope the pen that came with it will cover it up.,46470,3
46470,"Would not purchase again, if I wasn't out of the country I'd send it back.",46470,3
46471,I ordered this bikini for spring break and it got here quickly.,46471,3
46471,I was very happy with the color and it looked very pretty.,46471,3
46471,The only thing I noticed that was different than the picture was that there was less of a V to the neck and also there wasn't as much fringe on the top as shown.,46471,3
46471,It was a little more bare.,46471,3
46471,Also the bottoms looked like they were going to be too small.,46471,3
46471,I ordered a Small because that's what I usually wear.,46471,3
46471,"I am 5"" 3, weigh 115lbs, and size 34B.",46471,3
46471,The top fit perfectly but the bottoms were SUPER snug.,46471,3
46471,"Like, it was uncomfortable to keep on and they were not stretchy at all.",46471,3
46471,I do have a bubble butt so that was possibly part of it but the bottoms also just fit awkwadly.,46471,3
46471,Even if I had no rear at all they still wouldn't have fit right.,46471,3
46471,But I have other bottoms that look good with it so that's okay!,46471,3
46472,they are cute just way to large for my granddaughter.,46472,3
46473,"I liked it, just wish it was a little brighter.",46473,3
46473,I've taken pictures with and without the case flash and it's the SAME.,46473,3
46474,Material is on the cheap side.,46474,3
46475,"Nice dress, but the chest is a little too small.",46475,3
46475,"I wear a 22 pant and 20 top, and ordered the 22/24, and can just barely get the back zipped...another inch and it would fit great, which I did not expect since this dress goes up to size 24.",46475,3
46475,"I thought it would be loose, but it was not.",46475,3
46475,"Skirt is also somewhat figure hugging, not flowy at all.",46475,3
46475,"I do like the dress, but would order a size up next time.",46475,3
46475,And expect to wear spanx!,46475,3
46476,Decent fit but I'm sure won't withstand much working out!,46476,3
46476,Waitband is aggravating and Inseam is short - but beautiful colors and if you just going for show they are great,46476,3
46477,THESE ARE NICE I WORE THEM JULY 4 MY THIGHS ARE PRETTY BIG...,46477,3
46477,SO THEY ROLL DOWN THEY STAY RIGHT ABOVE MY KNEE...,46477,3
46478,"Not exactly the high quality I had expected, I would say it was medium quality.",46478,3
46478,"If you think the price is worth a medium quality wallet, then I feel you will be satisfied with this product.",46478,3
46479,"This dress is ""see through"" thin so will be saving it for summer.",46479,3
46479,Other reviews indicate that it runs small which it does.,46479,3
46480,"The buckles are not lined up so if you close one the other will not stay closed, if it wasn't for that I would buy more of them",46480,3
46481,"Liked the colors, next round I'll get a size up.",46481,3
46482,Purchased two pair out of the 4 shoes 3 came working one shoes did not work initially ...I charged the one shoe and it seems to be working (as of now) hopefully a simply charge is the permanent fix and not a bad shoe...they haven't worn them yet ..waiting for Halloween events ..if the one shoe turns out to be a problem..I will be returning them.,46482,3
46482,Will update is no problems.,46482,3
46483,It was very detail and shiny extremely gorgeous but it was way too big!,46483,3
46483,The chain was also very long and could be adjusted.,46483,3
46484,Ordered newborn size but would fit 6 months old,46484,3
46485,Built for small busts.,46485,3
46485,"The front has no form-fittling features and no cups, so it tends to make the breasts appear flat.",46485,3
46485,"If you have small perky breasts or are flat-chested, it may look ok, though Also note that the 35cm length indicated in the description is measured from the top of the shoulder down.",46485,3
46485,The transparent material is stretchable but doesn't stay well in place.,46485,3
46485,"3 stars though, because it is cheap and still offers a little support, and the back lace design is adorable.",46485,3
46486,The bodice doesn't fit properly.,46486,3
46486,It's not form fitting.,46486,3
46486,Maybe they expect everyone to have big boobs.,46486,3
46486,"I'm a size 4, 32DD, 5'10"".",46486,3
46486,The dress was long enough.,46486,3
46486,"If you're 5'2"" to 5'8"", you have to wear heels or get the dress altered.",46486,3
46487,The shirt itself is cute and as pictured.,46487,3
46487,"However, it came with a pretty large hole and it's not worth the hassle of shipping it back internationally.",46487,3
46487,The material is very thin so it needs to be worn with an under shirt as well.,46487,3
46487,"Update - After contacting the seller, they shipped a replacement at no charge and did not make me ship back the damaged product.",46487,3
46488,Cute watch but the wristband feels more like plastic than ceramic.,46488,3
46489,"This just arrived, and I'm deciding whether or not to keep it.",46489,3
46489,"It fits tightly in the shoulders - definitely runs small, but not terribly.",46489,3
46489,"The sleeves are full-length, and the overall length is good.",46489,3
46489,"This is definitely not a cardigan, though - it is nearly a straight seam from neck to bottom hem in the front, with no hope of closing.",46489,3
46489,"This is not a sizing issue - literally, the fabric of the back is twice as wide as the combined width of the 2 front pieces.",46489,3
46489,"Since the ability to make the front pieces meet was a feature I would have preferred, we'll have to see.",46489,3
46490,But it is not flared as it looks in picture.,46490,3
46491,coating came off quick,46491,3
46492,Not really needed as the glasses I ordered came with a protective case.,46492,3
46492,These were pictured with the glasses so I assumed none were enclosed,46492,3
46493,Bought this for my wife and it was way to big.,46493,3
46494,"I wear a size 6 in underwear and jeans, and I ordered the XL based on the sizing chart.",46494,3
46494,"The underwear themselves are not terribly uncomfortable, and they give my booty the most natural looking lift of any shapewear I've tried.",46494,3
46494,"However, these don't even come up to my belly button and they give a noticeable muffin top (which I don't usually get).",46494,3
46494,"They also cut into my thighs, which isn't flattering and is noticeable under jeans.",46494,3
46494,"For the price, I think they are still worth a shot, but I think you'd need to combine some other shapewear with these to get good results.",46494,3
46495,This product is slightly smaller than 18months.,46495,3
46495,It will probably fit my son for a month before out grown.,46495,3
46495,He is a shorter baby and just out grown his 12months at 16months.,46495,3
46495,And this product just barely fits.,46495,3
46495,Its also very thin.,46495,3
46496,"Cheaply made, but great price.",46496,3
46497,"Love Carhartt products for my husband, but these pants weren't what we expected.",46497,3
46497,"They were too tight in the waist, not loose fit at all.",46497,3
46497,I returned them for a different Carhartt style pants.,46497,3
46497,Got my fingers crossed they'll fit my husband the way he wants them to.,46497,3
46498,Nice and warm but they do get those little numbs up after a few washings.,46498,3
46498,Not the best quality but severs its purpose around the house.,46498,3
46499,The color is not so vibrant as i tought.,46499,3
46499,"I ordered in red and was expecting a really deep red, almost crimson.",46499,3
46499,However the color in the bag is more like a dark fushia.,46499,3
46499,"I'm still getting used to it, i will use it but a will keep looking for an elegant red bag.",46499,3
46500,pretty big i wish i could exchange them.,46500,3
46500,i still haven't worn them .,46500,3
46501,really thing and poor quality but fit as espected,46501,3
46502,gave to a friend,46502,3
46504,"They are cute, and soft, but my kids complain that the feet are too light and uncomfortable.",46504,3
46504,Everywhere else it fits fine though.,46504,3
46504,"I tried to cut the elastic around the ankle to make it better, but they still say the heal and sole of the foot feel ""weird"".",46504,3
46505,They were advertised as pink.,46505,3
46506,run 2 size too big.,46506,3
46506,restocking fee didn't like.,46506,3
46507,The shirt looked somewhat different as far as color quality.,46507,3
46507,Online it shows the colors being more bright and vivid.,46507,3
46507,Although when I received my shirt it wasn't as such.,46507,3
46507,It's still a cute shirt.,46507,3
46507,Just wish I had chosen a different color.,46507,3
46507,Maybe it would've helped?,46507,3
46508,"This ring is not black, not like a black tungsten ring.",46508,3
46509,I love how it looks but I I'm short so the product does nothing for my backside.,46509,3
46509,Will be replacing it with a smaller size,46509,3
46510,These do not seem as well made as the ones I had before.,46510,3
46510,The top strap is not of as good of material as my old ones.,46510,3
46510,The sole does not seem as firm yet cushion like.,46510,3
46510,"Because the top strap is more flimsy, they are harder to slip my feet into.",46510,3
46510,"But as far as flip flops go, they are still the best.",46510,3
46511,Based on reviews I sized up but possibly overdid it.,46511,3
46511,"Would probably look a bit more ""fitted"" had I sized one down.",46511,3
46511,May try to return/exchange,46511,3
46512,"If you are thinking of purchasing these insoles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Powerstep-Pinnacle-Orthotics-U-Blue-Blue-Men-s-10-10-5-Women-s-12-12-5/dp/B000KPKMX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics-U, Blue/Blue, Men's 10 - 10.5 / Women's 12 - 12.5</a>&nbsp;I'd strongly recommend you're buying a half size bigger than your shoe size.",46512,3
46512,You can always trim them down to fit but what I discovered was that they were somewhat short and therefore did not comfortably fit for my feet.,46512,3
46512,"The arch support and cushioned sole, however, are very good.",46512,3
46513,The upper wrapping material is quite short.,46513,3
46513,"After wrapping around, the end can not even meet.",46513,3
46513,"I like the style and material, though.",46513,3
46514,sizes are way off.,46514,3
46515,"These were lovely but tore by the hands almost immediately, we still made them work tho",46515,3
46516,Nice but it's to long,46516,3
46518,Got this for Christmas and it is already tearing.,46518,3
46518,The thread is not holding well.,46518,3
46518,It is a very cute purse but not very durable!,46518,3
46519,I wanted to love this bra - it's pretty & I love purple.,46519,3
46519,"The band & cup are true to size (I'm a US 32I / UK 32G), but unfortunately this bra provides no support whatsoever.",46519,3
46519,"My understanding is that surgically enhanced breasts don't require a whole lot of support so if that's you, this bra may be fine.",46519,3
46519,"If you have natural breasts, I wouldn't bother with this style.",46519,3
46519,I only wear it around the house.,46519,3
46520,"This piece looks nice in the box, but because of where the chain connects to the pendant, it doesn't sit flat on the chest.",46520,3
46520,This makes it looks kind of odd when worn.,46520,3
46521,Would suggest a belt to go with it if you don't look good in the style of dress.,46521,3
46522,This nightshirt is a bit thin but really cute.,46522,3
46522,I ordered the 2X bc I like my sleepwear to be loose (normally order XL).,46522,3
46522,The 2X fits more like a large so be aware when selecting your size.,46522,3
46522,Next time I will order a 3X if possible.,46522,3
46524,Rather big for a little nose,46524,3
46525,The actual sweater fits fine but the belt that you tie was made for a child and it is not able to be used with this.,46525,3
46526,"Too tight, no give.",46526,3
46527,a bit small  but still fits.,46527,3
46528,"It keeps the sun off of my arms, but it has started to unthread and it is just the first week I've used it.",46528,3
46529,Not as I thought but still a little cute,46529,3
46530,"Very cute hat, but the brim of it is very floppy, so it very easily covers my daughters eyes.",46530,3
46532,"It's a little cheap looking close up, but I still got a lot of compliments on it.",46532,3
46532,Exactly what I expected for the price.,46532,3
46533,Thin can see thread lines,46533,3
46534,"My daughter is a size 2 and the small was too small for her, in addition, it is very lightweight.",46534,3
46534,Definitely not made to wear in below freezing winter weather.,46534,3
46535,"Very cute dress, however the fabric was very thin and not of good quality.",46535,3
46535,There was a small hole forming after the first washing.,46535,3
46536,This product is made for more husky men.,46536,3
46536,I don't feel like it has a very professional look to it.,46536,3
46537,This is an awesome looking ring.,46537,3
46537,"I paid less than $20 for it, and I'm happy with that.",46537,3
46537,"I have large fingers (size 13+), and it fits me, after adjustment.",46537,3
46537,I have 3 minor gripes.,46537,3
46537,"The back of the octopus's head is smooth and has a ""cleft"".",46537,3
46537,It looks kind of like an upside down butt-crack.,46537,3
46537,3 The tips of the arms that go around your finger are a little too pointy.,46537,3
46537,"Maybe it's just because I have them opened up pretty far, but after a while they irritate my finger.",46537,3
46537,I think that gently filing them will help.,46537,3
46537,"Edit: -1 star, because after less than a week of wear, I am wearing away at the silver plate, and can see filler metal.",46537,3
46537,The most affected area is the tentacle on the top of the head.,46537,3
46538,The ribbon ring is super adorable.,46538,3
46538,You totally get what you pay for.,46538,3
46539,Just bought hair haven't wear it yet but wish it fuller and thicker in texture.,46539,3
46539,Looking forward to wearing it.,46539,3
46540,"Im so happy that it came early, the delivery date says January 26 Im glad becuse i needed this by nextweek for my boyfriend birthday.",46540,3
46540,"The hoodies looks good but i noticed the color is way different than in the picture, and the size also i ordered XXL but it looks like Meduim to me.",46540,3
46541,"Beautiful shirt, runs a little tight in the bust.",46541,3
46542,"They look good on the outside and they are comfortable, bit turn them inside out and you will find they are unraveling right out of the package.",46542,3
46544,Very pretty in person.,46544,3
46544,Bust is very large.,46544,3
46544,I'm a C cup and this padded cup is way too large.,46544,3
46544,I love the bathing suit so much that I'm going to see if it can be tailored.,46544,3
46544,I've never had to have anything tailed before.,46544,3
46544,The bust is non adjustable and the padding cannot be removed.,46544,3
46545,The material of this skirt is very cheap.,46545,3
46546,"Ok, male wearing size 13 shoes.",46546,3
46546,I got the equivalent (large) pair.,46546,3
46546,"Probably close to size 14, wide, with massive calf holes.",46546,3
46546,I had to put a pair of socks down in each one in order to wear them.,46546,3
46546,The calf holes are made for guys who powerlift with their legs or something.,46546,3
46546,"HOWEVER, they were better than anything available locally, and with the added socks, they fit 'ok'.",46546,3
46546,"They were not particularly comfortable without the socks though, so plan on using some kind of padding/insert.",46546,3
46547,Very pretty and was excited to see how nice it looked!,46547,3
46547,"However, a stone was missing in one of the bands...",46547,3
46548,The was a little snug but very flattering,46548,3
46549,"Doesn't really look like the picture, made from cheap material, but considering the price I think I got what I paid for.",46549,3
46550,"I usually wear a medium, but I read reviews that is runs big.",46550,3
46550,"So I purchased a small, the small is a tad bit too big, but I can make it work",46550,3
46551,"It does cover well endowed women, however, without any type of silicone strip, or elastic, it will eventually slide down with gravity.",46551,3
46551,"Even so, its very pretty, very soft, and works well for what I needed.",46551,3
46551,(something pretty to see with a shirt that has a sheer back panel.),46551,3
46552,It's great except that the average makeup brush is too long for the location the bag allows for them.,46552,3
46553,pretty see through  not great quality fabric but cute print,46553,3
46554,Color was much lighter than shown and did not go well with my skin tone.,46554,3
46555,"I love this product, but as a tunic.",46555,3
46555,I have to wear this with leggings or else ill flash everyone in sight.,46555,3
46555,Also it doesnt really indicate where the front and back are so i always have to guess which side is which.,46555,3
46555,"That may not bother others, but it irks me a little",46555,3
46556,The threading on the bottom hem of the top started coming loose and ultimately unraveled while wearing the top once.,46556,3
46557,"Turned my neck green within a week, even though i l took it off before I showered.",46557,3
46557,Was cheap what do you expect.,46557,3
46558,I really liked the bag but felt it was too small.,46558,3
46558,I wanted to use it for trave/sighs seeing.,46558,3
46558,Wish the straps had some chain.,46558,3
46560,The fit was a bit off too small on the top and for my height way too long.,46560,3
46560,I really loved the dress & disappointed that I had to return it.,46560,3
46560,I recommend if you're going to purchase this dress you measure yourself and buy according to measurements.,46560,3
46561,A lot smaller than realized.,46561,3
46561,I used it to make a necklace and hope that it will sell soon.,46561,3
46562,"It was ok, didn't like the material.",46562,3
46563,"I have wide feet, and I thought unisex/men's shoes would be wide enough (my feet aren't so wide I can't still find plenty of women's shoes--even heels--to wear).",46563,3
46563,These pinched a little around the toes.,46563,3
46563,"I bought them to walk around in and be comfortable, but they're not, so now they just collect dust in my closet.",46563,3
46563,"They're good quality and look nice, though.",46563,3
46564,Really expensive for what it is.,46564,3
46564,Also seemed very small.,46564,3
46564,"I ordered a 1 as i'm very petite, 5'2"", around 115 at 14 weeks, pre-pregnancy size 2-4.",46564,3
46564,"I couldn't wear it after 18 weeks, and its so expensive to buy a larger size.",46564,3
46565,I don't like that you can see the lines in the thigh area while wearing pants...even in jeans.,46565,3
46566,Got a 2XL and the torso fits well but the arms are HUGE... lots of extra fabric,46566,3
46567,"I bought a large, it fits like a small",46567,3
46569,XXL is too small.,46569,3
46570,The print looks exactly like in the picture.,46570,3
46570,The fabric has a great feel for summer.,46570,3
46570,The top portion fits beautifully.,46570,3
46570,I only wish the slits had been executed better.,46570,3
46570,They do look like someone hacked with a pair of scissors and took off way more than they should have leaving the center piece way too narrow.,46570,3
46570,Still wearable and absolutely worth the price.,46570,3
46570,If it bothers me enough I may make it a knee length sundress.,46570,3
46571,I was really excited to get this but the front is nothing like the photos.,46571,3
46571,"Does not have that curvy lining, it's more like a sports bra or just the upper part of a cami tank top.",46571,3
46571,I wish the front actually looked like the photo.,46571,3
46571,The back is perfect and is the only reason why I decided to keep it and not return it.,46571,3
46571,It was kind of big for me because I have no boobs and I am a 32B.,46571,3
46571,It completely covers my cleavage unnecessarily almost like a scoop neck tee.,46571,3
46571,The material was soft but also felt like it could rip easily if I took it off without being careful.,46571,3
46571,Too much material for the front for me though.,46571,3
46571,It also has stitching in the middle of the bralette between the boobs which is clearly not shown in the photo.,46571,3
46572,It was a bit big and the stiching on the leg was a bit weird for the rest of the fabrics looseness.,46572,3
46572,"I kept it for pjs, but im not thrilled.",46572,3
46573,Fits my gf well but the top is too small,46573,3
46574,I really liked this dress.,46574,3
46574,"It looks just like the picture and it isn't too small in terms of tightness, it's just the waist comes up way too high.",46574,3
46574,"I'm 5'6"", wear a 34 D, and am long waisted.",46574,3
46574,"The picture shows the waist where it belongs, at the smallest part, but the waist actually came really high up on the ribs for me (almost right under my breasts).",46574,3
46574,"It just didn't look or feel right, so I had to return it.",46574,3
46574,"If you have a shorter waist, or a modest bosom, this is a really cute buy.",46574,3
46575,I am 5'4 and weigh around 130 pounds and ordered a medium.,46575,3
46575,They do fit however they are a little tight/small.,46575,3
46575,They do not really stretch at all.,46575,3
46575,These leggings are cute however but you must wear them with a longer shirt.,46575,3
46575,They are see through!,46575,3
46575,Maybe if I ordered a size up they would fit a little better but I am content with this product for the most part.,46575,3
46576,The chain turned green after a week but the pendent is nice,46576,3
46577,The clamping part is too small.,46577,3
46577,I managed to bend them to make it work but they definitely do not stay on.,46577,3
46578,Study plastic -- a bit too.,46578,3
46578,And larger than my current wallet.,46578,3
46578,Not subject to trimming.,46578,3
46578,Not returning but when I use I would use on those (rare) occasions when I would only carry credit cards and wasn't worried about transparency.,46578,3
46579,"Did not match measurments, but adorable if had fit.",46579,3
46579,ReturnedVery small in bust like 32,46579,3
46580,This is a lovely and sleek bag with all the compartments I wanted.,46580,3
46580,"HOWEVER, it sags with weight.",46580,3
46580,I did not like the way it looked or felt.,46580,3
46580,The straps dug into my shoulder.,46580,3
46580,I've included photos showing 4lbs of weight in it (two 2lbs dumbbells); what it looked like without the weight; the clip for keys; the interior compartments; and some dimensions.,46580,3
46580,It's a nice looking bag when nothing is in it.,46580,3
46581,"It was too small, but it does look decent.",46581,3
46582,The back is made shear so you can see bra through it.,46582,3
46583,These rings are nice.,46583,3
46583,However the opening where the bead goes is quite small.,46583,3
46583,I had to use pliers to remove the ring.,46583,3
46584,I wish this would have fit!!,46584,3
46584,"I wear a L/XL, bought an XL, and the fit through the body was great.",46584,3
46584,"However, it smashed my boobs down so much there was no way to wear it.",46584,3
46584,It was even a little painful.,46584,3
46585,The purse is nicely made and very attractive but I agree with previous reviewers that it needs a longer strap so it can be a shoulder bag.,46585,3
46586,The color was not what I expected.,46586,3
46586,I wished it had actually been turquoise and NOT blue.,46586,3
46587,It's a very nice set.,46587,3
46587,"However, the earrings are so thick that I can't put them in my ears, they don't  slide in thru my ears.",46587,3
46587,"Also, when the set arrived the first time, it was missing the bracelet.",46587,3
46587,"I contacted the seller, and received my bracelet later in a separate shipping free of charge.",46587,3
46588,"I like the material, quick delivery.",46588,3
46589,"beautiful earrings, seems like they are made of good quality....only thing i don't like is the back doesn't stay locked and secure, i've almost lost them a few times, just have keep adjusting the lock part.",46589,3
46590,I received this item with some holes in it and it was darker than the photo.,46590,3
46590,"Surprisingly, i was able to fit in them.",46590,3
46590,Im 5'3 125lbs with very long legs and they fit nice.,46590,3
46590,I bet if i grow anymore they'll be too small though,46590,3
46591,"Product arrived on time, looks like what picture shows.",46591,3
46591,I rated it 3 stars for two reasons.,46591,3
46591,The chains on each strand twist around each other very easily and is hard to fix unless you take it off to undo the twisting.,46591,3
46591,"The second reason is the chains easily tarnish with normal wearing of the necklace, within 2 days of wearing it, the chains were no longer the vibrant gold color as shown.",46591,3
46591,"Though you if you don't mind the tangling and discoloration happening, it's a ok piece of jewelry for the price.",46591,3
46592,Gave my son bad blisters on the arches of his feet.,46592,3
46592,That's just our experience though.,46592,3
46592,Overall seems like a good product and will hold up until you need to move up a size.,46592,3
46593,An inexpensive versatile Halloween costume.,46593,3
46594,"I like the way it fits over the head however, I'm not fond of the lack of staying power.",46594,3
46594,It doesn't stay in place when moving.,46594,3
46596,I love the style!,46596,3
46596,Which is the main reason why I bought this shirt.,46596,3
46596,I'm disappointed tho because I ordered a size up so that way I knew it would for sure fit.,46596,3
46596,But a large was too tight and I wear mediums.,46596,3
46597,There is very little stretch in the waistband and the sizes are asian and run very small.,46597,3
46597,"I normally need a medium and discovered that if I want it to fit, I'd need a XXL.",46597,3
46597,"I am considered a ""medium"" in USA standards.",46597,3
46598,Super adorable and just as described.,46598,3
46598,However was just a smidge too small for my phone.,46598,3
46598,Was able to give it to my daughter who was just as thrilled.,46598,3
46599,The package says it will fit up to 145lb.,46599,3
46599,But only if you have short legs.,46599,3
46599,I'm giving these to my 13 year of niece how if short.,46599,3
46600,It is a beautiful shirt but too big for my 4 year old grandson.,46600,3
46600,I gave it too him anyway since I had already exchanged a medium for a small.,46600,3
46600,His mom said she will keep it until he grows a bit.,46600,3
46601,Piece of fabric that buttons attach to was sewn on crooked.,46601,3
46601,Not quite enough coverage for my tastes.,46601,3
46602,It didn't go all the way down my torso like the picture.,46602,3
46602,My lower tummy showed.,46602,3
46603,A well made leather bag but did not meet the beauty of what I have come to expect from a Brahmin handbag.,46603,3
46603,The handbag was quite wider and bulkier than what I was wanting.,46603,3
46604,The jeans fit according to size so no problem there.,46604,3
46604,"Cons: The dye used on these jeans has a strong, chemical smell which does not go away with a single washing.",46604,3
46604,It hangs around for awhile.,46604,3
46604,"Also, the material is a little on the thin side, so if you are expecting denim similar to Levi's, you will be disappointed.",46604,3
46604,"However, they are a true skinny jean and fit close to the skin.",46604,3
46605,"These underwear don't have a pouch for the man parts ,but keep you cool though the clothes and feel comfortable.",46605,3
46606,"I loved the shape and the pattern, but it was waaay too small, sizes are not right on this product.",46606,3
46607,Very pretty and extremely durable.,46607,3
46607,"However, some of the small stones are kinda crooked and I'm worried they're going to fall out, and the large center stone has become loose and spins in the prongs.",46607,3
46608,Shirt was a bit shorter then I expected or was comfortable with.,46608,3
46608,I would consider sizing up a size.,46608,3
46608,Quality seemed ok and print looks like it does online.,46608,3
46609,Beautiful top but runs very small.,46609,3
46609,"After reading the reviews, I ordered a Xlarge and it's still snug around the butt
And I wear a 10 - 12 in pants.",46609,3
46610,"Runs small, i where a 6 and got an xl.",46610,3
46610,I have to wear a bandeau top with it because it is cut too low.,46610,3
46610,Other than that i like it,46610,3
46611,"Comfortable dress, not thrilled with the bottom of it.",46611,3
46611,I wish it had more of a flowy open bottom if that makes sense.,46611,3
46611,It's almost a tapered bottom and that is not flattering to my body shape nor probably any plus size woman's body shape as it is marketed towards.,46611,3
46611,Picture makes it appear to have a much more flowy skirt than you actually get.,46611,3
46612,"Descent quality, but the size is WAY TOO SMALL.",46612,3
46612,"I'm usually a small, I ordered a Medium based on the size chart and everyone else's reviews but it's way too small.",46612,3
46612,"If you want to order this, go two sizes up.",46612,3
46613,"Placed return request over a week ago, no..reply.",46613,3
46614,Very see through----but still super cute!,46614,3
46615,Love the color and the size is comfortable.,46615,3
46616,"It was delivered as promised, even with the holidays.",46616,3
46616,It seemed to be of decent quality.,46616,3
46616,"However, I ordered an XL (and got an XL) but the size of the shirt was more like a medium.",46616,3
46617,"The picture made it look really long, but it also shorter",46617,3
46618,Great watch band could use an additional link,46618,3
46619,"Love the style and feel of the fabric but be aware - this item is NOT lined and has a plunging back making the choice of ""upper"" undergarments a challenge.",46619,3
46620,The jewels started falling off with in a few days of receiving the purse.,46620,3
46620,The cross on the wallet is upside down.,46620,3
46620,it also wasn't pink it was magenta.,46620,3
46621,"These look great on you, but unfortunately you can't see s*** while you are wearing them at night, definitely get the ones with clear lenses since the glow effect is mostly lost during the day.",46621,3
46622,It is what it is.,46622,3
46622,It's like any toy you could buy from Wal-Mart or a similar store.,46622,3
46622,Cheaply made but my eight year old loves Star Wars so this was like the best thing ever to him.,46622,3
46622,It hasn't broke yet and still entertains him.,46622,3
46623,"It wasn't as soft as I expected and kindda thin, but I can work with in and put a backing on it to make it softer on the skin.",46623,3
46625,"It was okay, just a little to big",46625,3
46626,It's a very pretty top but I felt too much exposure in the breast area on the side shows...but I'd you want super sexy and don't mind it's great,46626,3
46627,Bought this for my son.,46627,3
46627,"He loves them, but they are a little small.",46627,3
46628,Basic and as advertised.,46628,3
46628,Material was a bit less refined than expected very casual,46628,3
46629,"Good material and decent delivery speed, but the top is made for large chests.",46629,3
46629,I am a B and even the smallest size was too big for me.,46629,3
46629,Bottoms fit fairly well.,46629,3
46630,"Not bad, just to long , I will have it altered",46630,3
46631,I LIKED THE COLOR BUT THE SIZE WAS SMALL ESPECIALLY ON MY CHEST.,46631,3
46631,THE MATERIAL SEEM CHEAP.,46631,3
46632,Review that said shrinks a lot was soooo wrong.,46632,3
46632,Not a true XL in width but it's was long.,46632,3
46632,Cutting the bottom off!,46632,3
46632,"I'm 5'10"" 140lbs, solid not chubby, it was a dress and after washing it was a long Tshirt.",46632,3
46632,Maybe should've gotten large or mediums!!,46632,3
46633,I thought it would be more form fitting but non the less I still like it... And it got here before my shipping date,46633,3
46634,Nice gift but lightweight and not a high quality item.,46634,3
46635,"a bit too tight on arms, otherwise good strong fabric",46635,3
46637,I take (M) but if I want to pay again I will be take (L) ..,46637,3
46638,Breaks easily and rusts easily too,46638,3
46639,"the shirt is pretty, but it was to small for me.",46639,3
46639,I ordered a large size.,46639,3
46640,Too small-- had to give it to my wife.,46640,3
46641,I really like this but it's small.,46641,3
46641,The top fits fine but the bottom is tight.,46641,3
46641,I bought a large and I usually wear a medium but I'm still a little snug,46641,3
46642,More likely female size,46642,3
46643,The jeans wasn't as dark as the pic,46643,3
46644,I was hoping for better quality.,46644,3
46644,l washed the tshirt once so far and the cat print started to peeling off.,46644,3
46645,"Its ok i thought that it would be sliver hardware, but i like it.",46645,3
46646,It was too small for my 3 years old daughter.,46646,3
46646,Her weight is 15 kg.,46646,3
46646,The product is great,46646,3
46647,"this item is true to the picture's detail, doesn't pinch or cause any pain while wearing.",46647,3
46647,It is a bit big which doesn't help with the realism factor.,46647,3
46647,But definitely before you make the commitment of piercing your septum try this,46647,3
46648,side seams were a little bunched up.,46648,3
46648,otherwise fit and shape were nice.,46648,3
46649,Like the shirts overall.,46649,3
46650,it was very long knee length but fit as expected,46650,3
46651,"Hat was a little long so as the top sits on your head it looks kinda weird, but I still got compliments on it and it's still very warm.",46651,3
46651,would've given it 3.5 if i could.,46651,3
46653,"They were really cool but were super flimsy, they ripped in multiple places the first time I wore them and they completely fell asleep in the wash (I know it says not to wash them but I'm lazy, so I gave it 3 stars).",46653,3
46653,They would be super cute if they were more durable.,46653,3
46654,"Gave it to my nephew, he loved it.",46654,3
46655,got it for my daughter!,46655,3
46655,Had a hole in the top I had to fix for her,46655,3
46656,Not true to size.,46656,3
46657,finally a pair that isn't see through!,46657,3
46657,they are comfy but the threads are constantly pulling and need to be cut so not made the best.,46657,3
46658,they are nice but the gadge is bigger than i though so i cant wear them as a nose ring... and they make my tragus hurt really bad so im not sure when or where i will use them.,46658,3
46659,They are ripping in three warm water washes.,46659,3
46659,Won't buy another pair--too thin.,46659,3
46660,"This is a very pretty ring, but I have found that I don't wear it because of how obviously fake it looks to me.",46660,3
46660,"if that is not a concern for you, then I would recommend it.",46660,3
46660,"If you're looking for something to replace a genuine ring, I would keep looking.",46660,3
46661,I really like the top .I would buy more if the top came in more then one color.,46661,3
46662,"Ordered size xl; however, through the bust line it is really narrow.",46662,3
46662,Not meant for big busted women.,46662,3
46663,For a small head,46663,3
46664,I liked it wore it to a wedding a casual one !,46664,3
46665,Zipper pulls broke off soon after use.,46665,3
46667,It's not actually a scarf.,46667,3
46667,It's a quality piece of satin but don't expect this to keep you warm,46667,3
46668,"UPDATE: I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because after wearing this costume for only three days at Comic-Con, it already has two small holes, and the edges (wrists and ankles) are starting to unravel.",46668,3
46668,"For ~$60, this is a little bit ridiculous.",46668,3
46668,"That being said, I got a number of compliments and I don't regret this purchase.",46668,3
46668,I'm just disappointed in the quality.,46668,3
46668,"Overall, this is a great costume.",46668,3
46668,"(I'm 5'6"" and 117 pounds, and I ordered a size Small, which fits well, though it's loose enough that an XS would probably also fit well.)",46668,3
46668,"That being said, I wish a few things had been better, especially given the price:

1.",46668,3
46668,"As most other reviewers mention, the mask is only a half-mask.",46668,3
46668,"It looks pretty cheap from the back, it's a little too big for my head, and the vision is fairly dark, which makes it hard to use.",46668,3
46668,"However, as I didn't plan to use the mask very much, this isn't that big of a deal.",46668,3
46668,The foam pieces on the shins were sewn on in such a way that they left a 3-inch gap between my leg and the piece.,46668,3
46668,"The gap is large enough to fit my fist in, and looks especially awkward from the sides.",46668,3
46668,"This would be easily fixable by undoing the stitches and sewing the foam pieces back on to fit the leg better, but it should have been correct to begin with.",46668,3
46668,I ended up wearing over-the-knee boots to cover them.,46668,3
46668,"While the top foam piece is pictured fairly high up on the model, it falls lower on me, making my already-short torso appear even shorter.",46668,3
46668,"Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have it in the right place.",46668,3
46668,"I'm giving this 4 stars because despite the small issues I have with it, it's a pretty awesome costume and I am happy with my purchase.",46668,3
46668,"I decided to add black arm warmers and over-the-knee boots, as pictured.",46668,3
46669,It's darker than the image posted.,46669,3
46669,"I wanted a very soft, light chambray shirt, and this was rigid and darker.",46669,3
46669,"Very Canadian tuxedo, not soft washed semi-denim shirt.",46669,3
46670,It fit around the waist but the arms were way too long.,46670,3
46671,plastic clasp are thick.,46671,3
46671,tendency to stick to skin when you don't move for a while.,46671,3
46672,Top of collar along the zipper is very sharp.,46672,3
46672,Cuts your face and under your neck if you zip the zipper all the way up to your neck.,46672,3
46673,I have chubby arms and they fit fine.,46673,3
46673,They're not tight at all.,46673,3
46673,"My only issues is they come with a smell, that I could only describe as dog pee.",46673,3
46673,What I did notice is that the smell does disappear after a while.,46673,3
46674,"It's okay, but the sizing is way too small.",46674,3
46674,The blazer needs to be exchanged...,46674,3
46675,"like ok, but one was broken right out of package",46675,3
46676,Shrunk a little bit.,46676,3
46677,Not quite what I expected quality-wise.,46677,3
46678,It's been a while since I bought a new belt as my current two were high-quality name brand belts.,46678,3
46678,I have and old black belt from Nautica that is very similar to this belt.,46678,3
46678,The key differences between this belt and that one are primarily in the leather and the buckle.,46678,3
46678,The leather on this belt has a very nice soft feel as if it is already broken in.,46678,3
46678,"However, the leather is so soft that after just a few days or wearing it I have already noticed that the leather is bunching up around the belt loops.",46678,3
46678,This belt already has more creasing and belt loop marks than my old Nautica belt that I have been wearing for the past several years.,46678,3
46678,The second drawback about this belt is the clasp.,46678,3
46678,The metal rolling tube that the belt slides one has a seam.,46678,3
46678,This seam impedes the belt from rolling on smoothly.,46678,3
46678,Admittedly this is a small concern and not a big issue but its just not something you will see on a more expensive belt.,46678,3
46678,"Despite the drawbacks that I listed this belt has a beautiful color, feel, and nice leather smell.",46678,3
46678,Plus it is made in the USA which is always nice.,46678,3
46678,Disclaimer:  I received this product at a free or reduced rate to provide an honest and unbiased review.,46678,3
46678,The above statements are based on my own personal experiences with the product.,46678,3
46679,wrinkles and bunches up after some time.,46679,3
46679,But it does work.,46679,3
46679,They should make one for moms that work out and do yoga.,46679,3
46680,Picture and description says and shows yellow and pink.,46680,3
46680,it is not yellow; it is more orange.,46680,3
46680,would not have bought it had I known it was orange.,46680,3
46681,"this is a medium and usually I am a small, it was rather tight.",46681,3
46682,Pretty but real thin material.,46682,3
46683,was a little tight,46683,3
46684,I was disappointed that the glasses I received were much larger than the ones shown.,46684,3
46684,"As a woman I prefer the smaller framed readers, and these were much too large for my face.",46684,3
46684,"I can see out of them which is great, however they will only be used for at home.",46684,3
46684,I now see that they state in the description that style may vary.,46684,3
46687,Cute for a little girl.,46687,3
46687,I bought two of these for my nieces.,46687,3
46687,They chain broke within three days.,46687,3
46688,Too tight around the arms,46688,3
46689,Nice colors as indicated in pic.,46689,3
46690,Pattern is printed on dress so wasn't sure how it would stand up to wear and laundering.,46690,3
46690,"Runs small but for the price, the quality was very nice.",46690,3
46690,Company very easy to deal with.,46690,3
46691,"It's okay, lots of loose threads hanging off the buttons and some of the stitching is uneven.",46691,3
46691,Not exactly the material I thought it was going to be.,46691,3
46691,"It's very thin, and there's a flap which has little purpose as far as I can tell.",46691,3
46691,It comes with removable little belts for for the sleeves and the waist.,46691,3
46691,"All of which are awkwardly positioned, in my opinion.",46691,3
46692,This product was sooooo good!!,46692,3
46692,"But watch out because after a couple months my clip for the chain totally fell apart, but besides that, it was a great product!",46692,3
46693,nice hat but material stretches and becomes too large for your head.,46693,3
46695,The material I don't like sorry,46695,3
46696,Didn't fit the same as their boot cut leggings.,46696,3
46696,Didn't like the shine either.,46696,3
46696,Won't purchase any more of these.,46696,3
46697,"runs a little small, I can fit is but its snug.",46697,3
46697,I normally wear a size 8/36C.,46697,3
46697,Material is not that great but for the beach I guess it will do the job.,46697,3
46698,It's okay but not as good as other items I have gotten.,46698,3
46699,"It is what it is,  but might want an eye patch you can see through.",46699,3
46699,Was hard to get use to.,46699,3
46700,I really love this purse and the small bag that comes with it.,46700,3
46700,"However, I do not like that only after a few months of using, it is starting to fall apart.",46700,3
46700,I find little shreds of black pleather in the pockets and the metal rings for the straps are starting to come loose as well.,46700,3
46701,Its a really cute dress but it is really really big and I ordered my regular size.,46701,3
46701,I would actually order down a size.,46701,3
46702,"I really like the style of the bracelet, however, it was too small and not easy to open (and I ghave a very small wrist.",46702,3
46703,"Looked a little ""cheap"" in my opinion.",46703,3
46704,Might work for a nurse but I'm an emt and need full size scissors.,46704,3
46704,Cute for home use though.,46704,3
46705,Fit more like a tank.,46705,3
46706,Reviews said to order up and I did.,46706,3
46706,The top is still small but I made it work.,46706,3
46706,Very lightweight but comfy,46706,3
46708,PROS-The weight of this is good.,46708,3
46708,CONS-I found it to short on the back.,46708,3
46708,It does not keep your neck covered in the back.,46708,3
46708,Cold air gets down your neck.,46708,3
46709,Based on reviews I purchased a larger size.,46709,3
46709,That was a mistake.,46709,3
46709,I had to reorder a smaller size.,46709,3
46709,It's a thick heavy lace.,46709,3
46709,So if you're looking for something light look on,46709,3
46710,Cute tshirt however he arm is way too small thus makes it uncomfortable,46710,3
46711,"While the design is very unique, the material is very thin.",46711,3
46711,It is a one size fits all.,46711,3
46711,I cannot image how anyone can fit into these.,46711,3
46711,I mostly wear a small or medium if they are cut very small.,46711,3
46711,these fit me but the waist is loose but I think it is because the material is very thin and slides down.,46711,3
46712,Love the pants but they were a little small.,46712,3
46713,"I have many pairs of Pumas and wear 11-11.5 in size, and ordered size 12 in these, but it was like I was wearing 10.5 in size, way too small.",46713,3
46713,"I'm always a big fan of Pumas, the style and quality are great, but I'm not sure what happened with this model with sizing.",46713,3
46714,Very small and no tabs to pull on baby's feet.,46714,3
46714,Cute while they lasted!,46714,3
46715,"Unfortunately, couldn't use myself...  Too small / tight for man hands.",46715,3
46716,Overall it's a very nice design but it runs small.,46716,3
46716,I usually wear size 14 or size 12 jeans and got the extra-large but it was still on the small side.,46716,3
46716,It shipped from China so maybe it is XL for a Chinese person.,46716,3
46717,"The material is nice, light, and spring appropriate.",46717,3
46717,"The general idea of the style is simple, modest, and flattering.",46717,3
46717,Only problem was the reviews said it runs small.,46717,3
46717,I ordered a medium and it was too big.,46717,3
46717,I suggest order to your usual size.,46717,3
46717,The main issue is it's tight in the arms.,46717,3
46717,Wish this dress fitted... Bummer.,46717,3
46718,"I liked the shirt , i just wish it didn't run so small .",46718,3
46719,"Dress itself is pretty, and quality seems quite decent, but I somehow missed that this is sausage-casing type material (OK, I'm being a bit cute, but not too much).",46719,3
46719,"I am often in between a small and medium sizes, I know, but if I'd realized it was essentially all stretchy I'd have opted for bigger size out of the gate--I will have to try exchanging and see if hangs well in larger size.",46719,3
46720,"really love this style and cut, however it does run very small.",46720,3
46720,The top fits fine but the bottoms dig in at the hips.,46720,3
46720,"Really wish I could buy this in an XL since the large was still too tight (tried medium first)

34C-28-38",46720,3
46721,"The foot bed is very comfortable, but the straps are rough & rub.",46721,3
46721,"I'm hoping after wearing them awhile they will get softer, but I won't be able to wear them a whole day for quite some time.",46721,3
46721,A real shame because they are great shoes with that one exception.,46721,3
46722,"I initially purchased the larger size, but was pleasantly surprised that I needed the smaller size.",46722,3
46722,"It definitely pulls you in, but it's not very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, I only wish I purchased this closer to my delivery rather than several months postpartum.",46722,3
46723,Effectively just black pantyhose for men.,46723,3
46725,This is well made---soft and cozy.,46725,3
46725,I read the reviews and ordered up 2 sizes.,46725,3
46725,It does not shrink much so it is way to large for me.,46725,3
46725,I am going to order another in a smaller size and give this one as a gift since the seller's return policy doesn't cover shipping and charges a restocking fee.,46725,3
46726,If you are a person that is skinny/slender then you should not order this sweater vest.,46726,3
46726,I usually wear fitted small dress shirts and this is just too large even for a small.,46726,3
46726,If you have a normal/average weight then the sweater vest should fit you fine.,46726,3
46727,I did not get the color that I had ordered.,46727,3
46727,"I ordered the light blue one, but got the grey colored one.",46727,3
46727,"It fit fine, but it was one size too small",46727,3
46728,"Definitely wouldn't want to lolly-gag around town with these on and nothing else to cover (aka, mostly transparent), but great price for what you get!",46728,3
46728,Quality seems fairly decent.,46728,3
46728,"Waistband isn't the thick/wide seam I typically love, but when you're wearing these for a costume at this kinda deal, you can't get too picky about little details.",46728,3
46728,"All in all, satisfied!",46728,3
46729,"cant beat the price, wish it was longer but really cute",46729,3
46730,it was comfy but large around the body,46730,3
46731,For the price this jacket is very nice on the other hand i normally wear a medium i ordered a xl after looking at the size chart an reviews it fits but i cant zip it up all the way but i am busty so i can sport it but not zipped up all the way,46731,3
46732,What was delivered did not match the description.,46732,3
46732,"I did still receive a similarly distinguished and great looking watch but without the white stitching and much to my disappointment, no luminosity to the numbers or hands.",46732,3
46732,Additionally the case back appears to be for a completely different brand called Engrwolf.,46732,3
46732,I have not tested the water resistance.,46732,3
46732,Gave 3 stars because it's still a very nice watch and I've received many compliments on it.,46732,3
46732,Just wish the description and photos accurately represented what I would receive.,46732,3
46735,The color is 2-3 shades lighter than portrayed on the web-site.,46735,3
46735,It looks faded and cheap.,46735,3
46735,It also runs small.,46735,3
46736,"It's pretty and delicate, but not exactly what I was expecting.",46736,3
46737,Bottoms fit top....does't...order way way up in size,46737,3
46738,"Nice, thin, summery material.",46738,3
46738,You will need to wear something underneath.,46738,3
46738,I ordered it too large.,46738,3
46738,"Normally I wear 1X, I should have ordered an XL.",46738,3
46739,"Perfect in the chest, but WAY too short to wear as a dress.",46739,3
46739,Always put leggings under it.,46739,3
46740,"While this was cute, it also appears to be cheaply made.",46740,3
46740,"The band's are very thin, and I have reservations about how well they would hold up under everyday wear.",46740,3
46740,The ends are clamped together with a very bendable metal with sharp edges so it's always catching on my clothes.,46740,3
46740,This is something I will only wear on few occasions and would suggest finding it elsewhere if you want higher quality materials.,46740,3
46741,"I found these in size 2 to be too tight in the waist, but the length came below the knee.",46741,3
46741,"When we originally bought them, she was 16 months old and in the 50th percentile for weight and height.",46741,3
46741,"I thought maybe they would fit better when she grew some, but the shorts still aren't right at 21 months.",46741,3
46741,I think the problem is that thick elastic in the waistband.,46741,3
46741,"She doesn't complain, but it leaves an imprint on her.",46741,3
46741,"The shirt has been worn more, but after several washes, the screened print is cracking.",46741,3
46741,"The quality is much better on Leveret brand PJs, so sticking with those.",46741,3
46742,Was a lovely dress for my sister's wedding.,46742,3
46742,However it tore easily during the photo shoot,46742,3
46743,"Cheap & Not What I Expected, But Somewhat Ok For The Price.",46743,3
46744,"Cute dress, neon coral and the inner slip lining is a bit short.",46744,3
46744,"I bought a size large as I'm normally a medium 5'2, 135lbs.",46744,3
46744,And curvy and it flowed nicely but only with a second slip!,46744,3
46744,Fun bright color perfect for summer 2016.,46744,3
46745,Nice bracelet and sturdy,46745,3
46746,"Not bad, sorta cheaply made but still decent, although the color is not as dipicted :/ I ordered aqua but it's deffinatly more of a dusty blue color",46746,3
46747,"Love the product, but it's not sized right.",46747,3
46747,I recommend getting a size larger than normal.,46747,3
46749,The lacy part in the back is quite itchy.,46749,3
46749,The design in the lace kind of resembles leopard print and my husband wasn't a fan.,46749,3
46750,Bags were really small and I couldn't fit all my daughters party favors into it.,46750,3
46751,"Very attractive looking and would be a great purchase however the zipped pocket on the inside lining unraveled, now there is a hole when I would usually put my miscellaneous items.",46751,3
46751,I just got the handbag and there is already a hole in the pocket.,46751,3
46751,I am very disappointed and concerned if the entire inside lining going to unravel soon.,46751,3
46752,What you see is not what you get.,46752,3
46752,The color in the photo is different from what I got like I got dark orange color.,46752,3
46754,Has denim stitching style and color as expected.,46754,3
46754,"Size LXL fit as expected for a 5'4"" 150 lbs.",46754,3
46754,Material is stretchy as indicated but not a stretch denim.,46754,3
46754,"OK for around the house/out in the yard so, I'll keep them.",46754,3
46755,My girlfriend bought three different colors and received two different brands.,46755,3
46755,The large size turquoise came in the Victoria Staywarm brand which fit her perfectly.,46755,3
46755,She likes the neckline which is lower than the other brand.,46755,3
46755,The large sized white and gray colors was a different brand and is a smaller fit on her with a higher neckline.,46755,3
46755,She would give five stars for the turquoise color and two stars because she can still fit in it even though it's snuggier than she'd like for the other two so she compromised with three stars for the rating.,46755,3
46756,the cups are very small.,46756,3
46756,i wear a 36D.,46756,3
46756,"my cup spillith over, if you get my meaning....but i wear it under tees.",46756,3
46756,"i am not in a relationship, so it is fine.",46756,3
46756,it would be fine if you were a b cup or small c.,46756,3
46758,The elastic that goes over your fingers to keep it on came off after wearing it once.,46758,3
46758,I had to sew them back on.,46758,3
46758,It was also very tight on my fingers so I just pinned it to my shirt.,46758,3
46758,The butterfly pattern is beautiful and it was just what I was looking for.,46758,3
46759,Runs a bit large but love the softness of the shirt and the cool Ghostbuster graphics.,46759,3
46760,You have to have the right figure to wear this suit.,46760,3
46761,"I gave this purchase 3 stars because they are really cute, but unfortunately I will not be able to wear them.",46761,3
46761,"The description says ""Material: Acrylic Fibers"" but they must be made of wool because I am allergic to wool and I broke out in a rash when I tried them on.",46761,3
46762,Very large for a size 6,46762,3
46763,It looks very nice although somehow felt small.,46763,3
46764,"I really liked this sweater, but it had big hole on the side.",46764,3
46764,I'm  new on Amazon so I didn't know how to return it so instead I just sewed it myself.,46764,3
46764,"It was smaller then expected, but i don't mind for it to fit a little snug, just don't plan on gaining any weight or it will be all bad.",46764,3
46766,Very cheap thin material.,46766,3
46767,Loved the look of the shirt when I got it; it fit well.,46767,3
46767,"However, after washing and drying it, it shrunk in length.",46767,3
46767,"Now my son has a shirt that is big enough for him, but not long enough.",46767,3
46769,I bought this bracelet for my wife last Christmas and she loved it.,46769,3
46769,Three months after the bracelet broke (the end silver piece holding the beads on) and I contacted the seller.,46769,3
46769,I was a little disappointed that their only reply was to order a new one with a link to the product.,46769,3
46769,"My thought is, if the first one broke after three months why would I buy a second especially when the seller replied the way they did.",46769,3
46769,I found a different bracelet from a different seller.,46769,3
46769,"Also, be careful when putting on and taking off, the wire can easily stretch.",46769,3
46770,Had to buy next size up.,46770,3
46770,I get the concept of this suit but it has to be somewhat wearable.,46770,3
46771,Love than shirt just shorted than I thought,46771,3
46772,The plugs are very pretty and they fit correctly.,46772,3
46772,Unfortunately they are a lot smaller in length so im pretty sure they will probably fall out since the sadle is small.,46772,3
46773,"I had no issues with the fit, but it just did not drape or hang properly.",46773,3
46773,"That said, it is still usable, just not as attractive looking as the photos were.",46773,3
46773,"The yarn was slightly itchy, but I wore long sleeves beneath, so that made it better.",46773,3
46773,"Additionally, I wished the turtleneck collar was looser, more draped.",46773,3
46774,"Its cute, the skirt it long but its ok",46774,3
46775,Purchased these for running.,46775,3
46775,"Fit was a bit small, but OK.",46775,3
46775,"Specifically I was looking for underwear that would support and keep everything separated (legs, groin, etc) so as to not have any chafing while running.",46775,3
46775,"The fit in the groin was not precisely what I was looking for, but they are comfortable for shorter runs.",46775,3
46776,You have to sit it close to your forehead to get the effect of a covered face but...it does the job.,46776,3
46777,The shoes and Lights look great!!!,46777,3
46777,My son was so happy when he seen them BUT they ran TOO small.,46777,3
46777,Couldnt get his food to slide in the shoe.,46777,3
46777,He is wearing an  8-8 1/2 toddler shoe and after reading some of the reviews I decided to order a 9 1/2 but they were still too small.,46777,3
46777,I even measured his foot against the bottom of the shoe and they are barely a match.,46777,3
46777,I still want a pair for my son!!,46777,3
46777,Going to try to order another size up.,46777,3
46778,It's cute but definitely not fit for long torsos.,46778,3
46778,Gaps a little in the back as it stretches.,46778,3
46779,I wear a 34 C and it is so baggy on me.,46779,3
46780,"For the price, it can't be beat.",46780,3
46780,The top fabric doesn't stand up quite as illustrated but the size is great.,46780,3
46781,I really like this ring because it is the perfect width to go with my engagement ring but one of the diamonds fell out after only 2 weeks so I am fairly disappointed with the quality of it.,46781,3
46782,"Great product, unless you put any pressure on it... then it falls out of alignment and makes a clicking noise with any pressure.",46782,3
46783,There's no way to adjust to make it smaller so it's a bit too loose and it's hard to put on without help,46783,3
46784,good for the price but had to pop in the lenses because they had popped out unfortunately upon delivery,46784,3
46785,"Although this shirt reminds me of home and is one of the best graphics I've seen, even after babying it through the washing in cold and hanging it dry it still wasn't right.",46785,3
46785,Its just too short.,46785,3
46785,I've already got plans for it so no big deal.,46785,3
46785,Just wanted to warn any beer belly dudes.,46785,3
46786,These are good looking and seem to fit well.,46786,3
46786,I have not worn them yet so can't judge how long they would be comfortable.,46786,3
46786,I did notice scratchy seams across the top where the elastic is attached to the shoe so not sure how comfortable they will be without socks so giving three stars because may hurt when I wear them.,46786,3
46786,Good service from the seller.,46786,3
46787,From what I could tell was made out of nice material and would've been comfy to wear.,46787,3
46787,I advise anyone interested in this to get a size or two larger than your normal size.,46787,3
46788,"Really cute but 2 of the pinks ones, corners weren't glued into place, so they lift away from the frame.",46788,3
46788,"I'm assuming in time, the silicone face will fall off.",46788,3
46789,High quality material but if you are used to dressing slim this isn't really one of those shirts.,46789,3
46789,"5'11"" Asian slim build here and this doesn't fit well like H&M does for me.",46789,3
46790,not so shiny but it's okay,46790,3
46791,"Out of the set of 4, I could not open 1 of them - the default code did not work and I went through the entire combination code from 0000-9999 to no avail - it took me several days as this is an extremely tedious chore which most definitely did not make me happy.",46791,3
46791,"These locks are supposed to give some sense of security, but in reality, you can easily open them with a hairpin in less than 5 seconds - a royal TSA screwup of epic proportions.",46791,3
46792,The dress fit ok size-wise but the style/material/lines are not nearly as neat-fitted to the body as shown - there were creases everywhere on the chest area.,46792,3
46792,The zipper was extremely hard to do up - I couldn't do it myself and my boyfriend had a super hard time trying to help me.,46792,3
46792,I ended up returning the dress.,46792,3
46792,Ever Pretty was great about refunding the cost of the dress (not any of the shipping costs).,46792,3
46792,"I was ok with that, just pointing out as some people feel strongly about this.",46792,3
46793,Shrank considerably after a couple washes.,46793,3
46793,"I try to be careful, wasn't anticipating so much shrinkage.",46793,3
46794,Fit fine...fabric thinner than expected.,46794,3
46795,LOVE THE DRESS; HAD TO GIVE IT AWAY THE SIZING WAS WAY OFF!!!,46795,3
46795,"WOULD ORDER AGAIN IF IT WAS THE CORRECT SIZE,I LOVE THE DRESS!",46795,3
46796,The sizing is just not great for me.,46796,3
46796,The quality is above average for todays products but thats not saying a lot.,46796,3
46797,CUTE BUT TOO SMALL,46797,3
46798,The color was actually kind of orange.,46798,3
46798,Odd lingering odor and I get a little itchy when I wear it.,46798,3
46798,Would not purchase again.,46798,3
46798,I could have done better.,46798,3
46799,It is for girls!,46799,3
46801,"However, it is somewhat tight for a medium.",46801,3
46801,"However, I believe the large would be much bigger.",46801,3
46801,I know this is supposed to be tight but it depends on what you are comfortable with.,46801,3
46801,I am 5'6 and around 156 pounds.,46801,3
46801,I have a smaller torso so it fits but is a little tighter around the hips/stomach.,46801,3
46802,Would be okay if from the knee down wasn't baggy.,46802,3
46802,It has a weird shape.,46802,3
46803,"Arrived wrinkly, seems ok quality.",46803,3
46804,"Cute, but rhinestones began falling off upon first few steps!",46804,3
46805,"It is pretty but, was disappointed the one chain broke the first day I wore it.",46805,3
46805,But the nice thing was it came with two chains.,46805,3
46806,"I usually wear a Large in leggings, given the reviews I ordered an XL because I read they run small.",46806,3
46806,I'm curvy and short and the XL fit well for me.,46806,3
46806,They are not see through at all (surprised)!,46806,3
46806,"They were quite long on me so they bunch up a bit at the ankles, but I'm only 5'1.",46806,3
46806,"They kinda rolled down when seated, and the seems kina stretched out on the butt area when I put them on, but remember I'm curvy.",46806,3
46806,If they had a xxl I think they would have fit more comfortably.,46806,3
46806,"Overall there ok, I mean for only what $10 there an ok purchase.",46806,3
46807,It is nice for the price.,46807,3
46808,I wear a size small and ordered a small but I can hardly zip it up.,46808,3
46808,It runs really small...won't be able to wear it,46808,3
46810,It's cute just the paint look like it was peeling,46810,3
46811,Nice sweater in all but the one size fits as an xl,46811,3
46812,"It felt sturdy and well made, but fits large.",46812,3
46812,"I measured a medium, but decided to buy a small, and I could have used an extra small.",46812,3
46812,"I ended out returning it, because it would have been a waste to only use for a little bit, before needing the smaller size.",46812,3
46813,These slippers arrived in two different sizes.,46813,3
46813,I was bummed that I had to send them back.,46813,3
46813,They were cute and one of them fit really well haha.,46813,3
46814,"Looks very nice and is quite comfortable, but came apart at the seams in some areas.",46814,3
46815,Cute looks like the pic but the soles look plastic not sure if that's safe for the snow and ice.,46815,3
46816,"average fit, hope for more secure package, won't buy another one.",46816,3
46817,Size is like 2-3 sizes too small compared to American sizes,46817,3
46818,"these kept my hands warm on those cold winter days, but I wouldn't use them as texting gloves.",46818,3
46818,These are thick gloves so I think that's why it's not so great for texting.,46818,3
46818,"At some extent it does let you text, but not properly, I mainly wanted these to keep my hands warm while I walked my dog in the mornings and at night, so it did the job.",46818,3
46818,"So if you're looking for texting gloves, look somewhere else.",46818,3
46819,"I buy for me but don't fit well, but my niece love it.",46819,3
46821,"wanted a solid jersey, this is more of a fishnet style.",46821,3
46822,after a month it started making noise.,46822,3
46822,you cant her the noise unless its dead quite.,46822,3
46822,i just turn the winder off at night.,46822,3
46822,sometimes i forget to turn it off and i don't notice the noise.,46822,3
46822,the noise is not that loud.,46822,3
46822,it only needs to run a few hours a day anyway so for the price cant complain,46822,3
46824,These shoes run super big.,46824,3
46826,I normally wear a medium (juniors).,46826,3
46826,Ordered a XL and it is a bit small.. love design tho,46826,3
46827,She can't get them open to wear them.,46827,3
46828,It was really cute but it fit kind of loose I'm 5'6 & 160 and usually wear a medium but the dress fit like a large,46828,3
46829,It run a little small.,46829,3
46829,But I love this coast.,46829,3
46830,My wife likes them but not as much as I thought,46830,3
46831,The watch keeps good time but the step monitoring is quite a bit off on accuracy.,46831,3
46831,It sometimes registers steps even when you're not moving.,46831,3
46831,I would say the accuracy is off by about 5-10% on the high side for total mileage/steps walked during the day.,46831,3
46831,The heart rate monitor works only sporadically.,46831,3
46831,"Also, the supplied instructions on how to use the various functions are for the most part written in mandarin characters and are essentially useless to those who know only English.",46831,3
46831,"Simply trial and error is how you learn to operate the various functions on this pedometer watch, but for $16 what can you expect.",46831,3
46831,At least it keeps excellent time.,46831,3
46832,Shoes are a little big.,46832,3
46832,The weight is light.,46832,3
46832,So far my kid like it.,46832,3
46832,Need to see how long it will last.,46832,3
46833,"It arrive on time and It's a nice patch, sadly it's sew-on not iron-on I wish I had notice that detail before ordering it.",46833,3
46834,Lovely sparkling diamonds but the 14 kt white gold settings look so thin and flimsy that I am concerned they will not hold up to frequent wear!,46834,3
46834,"Seriously Amazon, why skimp on the setting?",46834,3
46835,Ordered a size larger & was still small especially in the arms/armpit area.,46835,3
46835,Disappointing since i liked the style & color.,46835,3
46836,They get holes in the bottom pretty fast,46836,3
46837,Hips are WAY too small.,46837,3
46837,I can't wear it.,46837,3
46838,The blade thin plastic (thinner than other plastic light sabers).,46838,3
46838,"My son used this to ""duel"" with his friends and the blade broke.",46838,3
46838,It's made thin so that the LED light can shine through.,46838,3
46838,"A thicker clearer plastic would've been better, but probably would've made the product more costly.",46838,3
46838,"If you're just going to use this as a prop, it works fine.",46838,3
46838,"If you're going to have a child use it to fight with other kids, it will likely break quickly.",46838,3
46838,"By the way, the hilt of the sword is longer than I expected.",46838,3
46839,I got an xl and I'm regularly a large and it fit rather small and awkward.,46839,3
46839,It did seem to help make me sweat I guess its just the sizing that bothered me.,46839,3
46840,These shoes are really nice looking.,46840,3
46840,"However, the sizing is way off.",46840,3
46840,"Based on previous reviews, most people had to size up 1 to 2 sizes larger to get a fit.",46840,3
46840,This was not the case with me.,46840,3
46840,"I normally wear between a 6-7 size shoe, but I wear a 4.5 with DC youth or mens size.",46840,3
46840,"Based on previous reviews, I ordered a size 6.",46840,3
46840,"These ended up being way too big, I had over an inch of space from my big toe to the top of the shoe.",46840,3
46840,I have average width feet so I think if I had the right size shoe they would likely fit that way also.,46840,3
46840,I'll try to exchange for a smaller size if the price is not exorbitant.,46840,3
46841,"It id ok, but is small",46841,3
46842,"Its pretty, but only lasted a month before the cross fell off",46842,3
46843,I did not like the fabric of the dress,46843,3
46844,Nice but runs small.,46844,3
46844,Buy 1 size larger,46844,3
46845,I'll give it three of five I love it don't get me wrong but the picture on the screen with the display manicin totally makes it look way bigger than actual piece,46845,3
46846,This is an excellent dress and would recommend it to anyone.,46846,3
46846,"The dress does run small, but i am okay with that.",46846,3
46846,"It is a very comfortable dress as well, so you can feel relaxed as well as give you a gorgeous feeling all at the same time.",46846,3
46847,The quality is OK.,46847,3
46847,"In the seam the stripes do not lineup, so sewing is off unless that is the style now.",46847,3
46847,"Although, I like the feel of the fabric, but the horizontal stripes make me look bigger than I am.",46847,3
46847,"The fabric is light, so I wear it at home.",46847,3
46847,"But, I don't wear it out much because it makes me look bigger than I am.",46847,3
46848,I just didn't like these on me.,46848,3
46849,"The ""finger"" loops are too small for even my pinky!",46849,3
46849,"I will have to midify them to be able to wear comfortable, otherwise the ""wings"" are as advertised.",46849,3
46850,I'm a size 8 and wear 'small' bottoms.,46850,3
46850,I ordered the XL and they fit quite snug.,46850,3
46850,I don't wear these to the gym... only around the house.,46850,3
46850,I would not be comfortable wearing these at the gym.,46850,3
46850,The design is fabulous.,46850,3
46851,Size was as expected,46851,3
46852,"Cute dress, but ran small in the bust.",46852,3
46852,I'm typically a small and after reviewing the measurements in the description I ordered a small.,46852,3
46852,"It measured  2 inches less than described in the bust, and was much to tight as the material does not have any give/stretch .",46852,3
46852,"Returning, may reorder in a larger size up.",46852,3
46853,Bought these for stage costume.,46853,3
46853,Leather scratches very easily.,46853,3
46853,Boots are not very good for people with small calves.,46853,3
46853,I buy shoes in size 5.5 but these boots were quite loose for me.,46853,3
46853,I wore these boots for a day and performed in them and surprisingly my feet did not hurt even after hours of wearing the boots though it felt weird walking in them cause they were loose.,46853,3
46854,"I like the bag,  however it is small for my needs.",46854,3
46854,You would think that a toiletry bag at almost $30 would b quite roomy-not so.,46854,3
46854,"The pic with the bottles of water sold me on the bag- very deceitful- you can get the bottles in there but there is NO way that it's closing, esp in the side pockets.",46854,3
46854,"So while the bag is cute, it's not as roomy as expected.",46854,3
46855,It's not quite what I was thinking it would be.,46855,3
46855,It's a little smaller and thinner.,46855,3
46855,It's kind of cute.,46855,3
46856,I'm sure this will work great but I'm normally a size 6-8 and I am not sure why I bought a Large.,46856,3
46856,"I'm only 25 weeks, I'm sure i'll be able to use this in my third trimester, I hope!",46856,3
46856,love how the strap goes right underneath my belly.,46856,3
46857,"Very fashionable, received in a timely manner but the fit was tighter than expected.",46857,3
46857,I wear a 8.5 in U.S.,46857,3
46857,But I guess I should've ordered a 9.,46857,3
46857,I've been unable to reach the seller to find out how to return and replace.,46857,3
46858,I tried several times to get this to stay on my 9 month old's head and she just wouldn't have it.,46858,3
46858,She is what I'd consider an average size 9 month old and it was a little big (though not too much).,46858,3
46858,"I think the problem is that it's floppy so as soon as it's on her she feels it on her ears, her forehead, everywhere - and she immediately grabs it.",46858,3
46858,I tried putting it on her while my husband held her and distracted her and the same thing - she stops what she's doing to grab it the second it's on her.,46858,3
46858,I eventually just went to Target and got a baseball cap.,46858,3
46858,It doesn't give her neck coverage like this one would but it's not all over her face and distracting her.,46858,3
46858,She leaves it on most of the time.,46858,3
46859,"Chest area is too tight, if I ordered a bigger one it would be too big.",46859,3
46860,"I'm 110 lbs and the ""medium"" (0-2) fit very small",46860,3
46861,This is a very baggy fit pajama almost to the point that I would say the proportions are off.,46861,3
46861,Very soft and warm though and good for a chubbier baby on a cold night.,46861,3
46862,"I like it, but was looking for more of a comfy and less fitted shirt.",46862,3
46862,Should have ordered a size up.,46862,3
46863,Good taps on the bottom.,46863,3
46863,Doesn't run true to size.,46863,3
46864,"Really pretty, feminine sweater, nice and heavy but not too heavy.",46864,3
46864,"It is very long, not faltering on shorter girls.",46864,3
46865,"Pretty shirt, color and style are great, but there are a few issues.",46865,3
46865,"The shirt is extremely sheer so I tried it with a tank top underneath, still too sheer and doesn't look right.",46865,3
46865,"I ordered a large but it is too small, so I ended up giving to my tiny teenage daughter.",46865,3
46866,Should have bought a bigger size,46866,3
46867,"First off, this arrived way before the expected date, which was nice.",46867,3
46867,My complaints are more towards the advertisement of the shirt.,46867,3
46867,"It's shown to have a cool faded pattern with deeper colors, when it arrived I was surprised to find that it was not really a faded looking pattern, but more of a paint-blotchy look, which is fine, but doesn't look anything like the picture.",46867,3
46867,And the colors were much brighter.,46867,3
46867,"It fits as expected and feels nice to wear, but once I put it on, the look of it was weird.",46867,3
46867,"Even though it's a nice feeling shirt, the colors and the look caused me to return this one.",46867,3
46868,Top was tight across my shoulders and the lace was itchy.,46868,3
46869,"I am 5'4, 125lbs; the shirt hits me a little higher than I'd hoped.",46869,3
46869,"The sleeve length was sufficient but if I raise my arms, the shirt lifts up high enough to show my mid section.",46869,3
46869,"I usually wear a small- medium but if I bought it again, I'd by a large.",46869,3
46869,The color is pretty and pattern unique which is why I kept it anyway.,46869,3
46870,Three stars cause.. well they are socks... but.. very rough and the seam at the toes is really really rough and annoying.. and they are a little small.. says it fits to size 11..,46870,3
46870,I'm a 10 and I would prefer them to be a bit bigger.,46870,3
46870,Not worth the high price charged for them,46870,3
46871,"Love the design but it's very thin and cheap material, you can see through it.",46871,3
46872,It's adorable but if your belly button is not fully healed it will pull and hurt you quite a bit cause the panda doesn't move at all,46872,3
46873,The band does its job.,46873,3
46873,I am in denial that I need to buy maternity clothes.,46873,3
46873,I thought this band would be a band aid so I could still wear my cute jeans.,46873,3
46873,I am 6 months pregnant and usually a size 3/5.,46873,3
46873,The band isn't as comfortable as one would think.,46873,3
46873,"The band is meant to be tight, so the buttons and zippers dig into your skin.",46873,3
46873,You have to make sure your wearing long shirt otherwise you can see the band.,46873,3
46873,I feel so self conscious all day thinking people can see the band or they can tell the buttons and zippers are wide open!,46873,3
46873,Plus I find myself pulling up my jeans often.,46873,3
46873,Just buy yourself some leggings and one pair of maternity pants and call it a day.,46873,3
46874,Size runs about a full size small,46874,3
46875,"I like it, but I got a 2x.. And it was still a bit small.",46875,3
46875,But I mean it still fits just barley tho.,46875,3
46876,Just what I expected with paying so little.,46876,3
46877,It was kind of pretty but poorly made.,46877,3
46877,Don't waste your money on this.,46877,3
46878,Bought a large and its still small.,46878,3
46878,I'm 5'8 and 150lbs.,46878,3
46878,"Still very sexy on, but not very comfortable.",46878,3
46878,(not that it stays on for long),46878,3
46879,The dress seems like a good quality.,46879,3
46879,"It's not tight, just seems like a comfy daydress.",46879,3
46879,"However, if you have a B cup or smaller, don't bother.",46879,3
46879,This dress has a ton of room in the chest area.,46879,3
46879,"I am 5'6"", weigh 120 lbs and wear a 34B.",46879,3
46879,I ordered the small and it seemed to fit only slightly loosly everywhere except the chest where it was huge.,46879,3
46880,I've bought about ten of these tanks in different designs and I'm not sure why maybe because I ordered purple but it was at least a size smaller than all the others,46880,3
46881,It doesn't really look like the picture but it's okay.,46881,3
46881,My bf said I look like a nurse in it.. Not sure if that's good or bad but it wasn't what I was going for.,46881,3
46883,"nice but very bulky , turned my current wallets bulk into a giant mass in pocket",46883,3
46884,Swallows my son's head but he still loves it.,46884,3
46884,Pom fell off but I stitched it back on.,46884,3
46884,Overall quality is good.,46884,3
46885,It's my corrected size... Shoe must running larger in sizes.,46885,3
46886,I could  have used a bigger  size.,46886,3
46887,loks real cheap.donated it salvation army.,46887,3
46888,"shirts are ok, but read size chart over and over, they still arrived too small.",46888,3
46888,but the seller was pretty cool,46888,3
46889,Nice swimsuit if you need alot of padding.,46889,3
46889,If you already have a large bust the top has alot of pabbing in it.,46889,3
46889,The padding cannot be removed.,46889,3
46890,Not high enough arch support.,46890,3
46890,"OK but 1/4"" to 1/2"" higher would be better since I have very high arches.",46890,3
46891,Very floppy - like a bonnet - when wet,46891,3
46892,"It is very small , if you have a bust this will not work
But it is a nice product other than being so small",46892,3
46893,"I purchased a black, and I can see the patterns of a bra through it so I wouldnt' wear these by themself.",46893,3
46893,This is great for layering but  that was not what I intended for in my purchase.,46893,3
46893,The straps are also very thin and don't feel like they will last too long.,46893,3
46893,I have purchased much higher quality camisoles at cheap clothing stores.,46893,3
46893,"I'm going to keep it for layering, but I likely wouldn't purchase another from this brand.",46893,3
46895,Silicon strip on the strap comes off too easily and fast.,46895,3
46895,Bottom of strap appears is beginning to unravel.,46895,3
46897,Too tight in arms...not long enough for a 5'10 woman.,46897,3
46898,it is reflecting from the inside,46898,3
46899,It's a nice size and I got it in pink and I love the color!,46899,3
46899,However it smells terrible and I noticed it as soon as I opened the box.,46899,3
46899,I also wish it was a little more secure.,46899,3
46900,Everything is great with this product.,46900,3
46900,The problem is you don't know if it's working or not.,46900,3
46902,BUT chain is weak and snapped after a few wears.,46902,3
46904,"The design is very cool but, I would recommend washing these alone by hand or with a small load turned inside out.",46904,3
46904,This shirt has only been worn twice and the design is washing off of it already.,46904,3
46905,The top fit my daughter fine but the bottoms were a bit small.,46905,3
46906,I'd recommend going a size up from what you normally wear.,46906,3
46906,"It's a well-made shirt, but shrunk a lot after washing.",46906,3
46906,I can wear it but it's too tight and probably won't become a favorite.,46906,3
46906,Too bad because it's a nice-looking shirt.,46906,3
46906,"For a T-shirt that costs this much, I expected better.",46906,3
46907,Smaller than I thought it would be.,46907,3
46908,Beautiful case but none of my watches will close.,46908,3
46908,The roll is just way too BIG!!,46908,3
46908,"They flop everywhere, Had it had individual pillows it probably would work.",46908,3
46909,"Gorgeous and fabric is great, but just needed to exchange it!",46909,3
46910,not very long in length.,46910,3
46912,"I was expecting larger, but other than the size it is a beautiful purse.",46912,3
46913,The top of the suit fit well with the x back.,46913,3
46913,(I'm a B cup).,46913,3
46913,The bottom not so much.,46913,3
46913,This brand is really close to its size chart and unfortunately I fall between sizes so not a great match.,46913,3
46913,It is a really cute suit and seemed well made.,46913,3
46913,Just not my cut.,46913,3
46914,Tried to unravel but I tied it off.,46914,3
46915,"Tight in sleeves, but as expected everywhere else based on the size chart.",46915,3
46915,"The sleeves are the only reason I rated it lower, and that's because they deter me from wearing it as much.",46915,3
46917,I usually wear a Medium but I ordered this in a size 6 and the fit was good.,46917,3
46917,What I didn't like about this blouse is that its see through so I had to wear a tank under it which I didn't want to do but I had not choice.,46917,3
46918,"The dress was nice but much longer than needed for someone who is 5'5"".",46918,3
46918,"It arrived in time but upon wearing it, it was claer several of the plastic beads were falling off.",46918,3
46918,This wasn't a huge deal but for the price I would expect them to be sewn better.,46918,3
46918,The dress was pretty and I received many compliments.,46918,3
46919,"Also the material feels like well, I'd prefer cotton for health purposes",46919,3
46920,"Forgot to take pics, but if you're above a B cup & fit in the waist, this jacket won't do much to protect you from the cold.",46920,3
46920,The inside is FLEECE so DO NOT DRY IN THE DRYER!,46920,3
46920,Even low heat will cause this to pill & become itchy.,46920,3
46921,My daughter loved this shirt!,46921,3
46921,"Make sure to wash and hang dry, because it doesn't hold up well and looks pretty worn after a few washes.",46921,3
46922,"The bag looks great and is made well, however it hadn't occurred to me that with the big flap, it turns the bag into a deep dark hole and makes it hard to just put something in there (in an organized fashion) or get something out.",46922,3
46922,You really have to nearly poke your head inside there to find what you need.,46922,3
46923,To small for me gave it to my sister,46923,3
46924,I bought this ring some time ago and now one of the small stones around the large stone fell out.,46924,3
46924,I was really dissappointed because I love this ring and did not wear it all the time.,46924,3
46925,Pretty jewelry but gets rusty fast and smells.,46925,3
46926,Check out Amoluv Women Round Neck Short Sleeve Pleated Lace Slim Dress.,46926,3
46926,you will see pictures of what the dress really looks like.,46926,3
46926,The dress does fit well.,46926,3
46926,It is one of those purchases that I was hoping for what I was asking for but not expecting to get what I was asking for.,46926,3
46926,It fits to american sizes and it came about 5 days earlier then the early expected arrival date.,46926,3
46927,Right size but very sharp and lip is tiny and abrupt,46927,3
46928,I bought three colors and they are two different brands.,46928,3
46928,"The teal is ""La Clef"" and drapes very nicely and is a great length (5'5), the mustard and heather grey are ""Hello Miz"" and are shorter and more narrow.",46928,3
46928,I'm returning those two.,46928,3
46928,I've posted a picture for reference.,46928,3
46928,I wish I knew which colors were La Clef.,46928,3
46929,The differentiation of the color of the stones is not as strong as pictured.,46929,3
46929,The color in all the stones is faded and it does not look like the picture.,46929,3
46929,"Still it is pretty and I like wearing it, just not what I expected..",46929,3
46930,Too tight for even very thin tablets.,46930,3
46930,Should design one with thickness.,46930,3
46932,I was disappointed that it was black and not stainless steel like the photo made it look but other than that it's ok.,46932,3
46933,I ordered a 5x assuming this was another Asian size.,46933,3
46933,"I am normally an American xl-1x and this was way too tight around the under arms as well as stomach, I am 5'9 and 195 if that helps",46933,3
46934,My daughter is 6' tall.,46934,3
46934,It's hard to find dresses long enough.,46934,3
46934,This dress is extremely long and arrived un hemmed.,46934,3
46934,"The dress fit great, per the size chart.",46934,3
46934,Well made EXCEPT for some rather puckered side seams on the skirt.,46934,3
46934,That's why I give it just 3 stars.,46934,3
46934,It would also be nice to know that the dress does not have a finished hem.,46934,3
46934,Color shown in photo is accurate.,46934,3
46934,Makes your bust line look good even if small chested.,46934,3
46934,Has a back zip.,46934,3
46934,Back of dress is high enough to wear a standard bra without showing.,46934,3
46935,"Tiny, tiny chest area.",46935,3
46935,Super cute if you are somewhat flat chested.,46935,3
46935,I also think most people would want to wear leggings with this dress.,46935,3
46936,Skirt is burgundy black.,46936,3
46936,Not red and black as it shown on the picture.,46936,3
46937,While it appears much like the photo.,46937,3
46937,My wife was disappointed that it was as long as shown.,46937,3
46937,"It was only waist length, not beyond the hips length.",46937,3
46937,"So she says not as nice as the pic, but few things seldom are.",46937,3
46938,A little see through.,46938,3
46938,After one was the seam started to come out.,46938,3
46938,Nice enough dress but could only wear once.,46938,3
46939,If I would have worn it it would have fallen off and bared my chest.,46939,3
46940,Perfect length a bit too tight around my thighs,46940,3
46941,I expected this to be a amazing travel pillow.,46941,3
46941,But it was only okay comma not to mention that I truly didn't realize what it look like until I blew it up on the plane.,46941,3
46941,"My adult son said ""don't get that near me ,that looks disgusting.",46941,3
46941,"""And then I realized that it really did look obscene...ooops!",46941,3
46941,Once I realized that .,46941,3
46941,I didn't want to take it out anymore.,46941,3
46941,"Soooooooooo , it did blow up with just a breath or two, and did offer more neck support than the regular u shaped pillows  but this looks a bit Pornographic, I don't think I'll use it again",46941,3
46942,The Legg's Women's Control Top Pantyhose are a good price for a 3 pack.,46942,3
46942,"They fit as expected, but do tend to get runs easier than most pantyhose I've purchased.",46942,3
46943,"It's just a little tight, but it is ok if I leave it unzipped.",46943,3
46944,"It is beautiful- large, just how I like it!",46944,3
46944,"However, a few caveats.",46944,3
46944,It is hard to tell the time- a drawback in a watch I would say.,46944,3
46944,( I am coping and getting used to it).,46944,3
46944,The hands on the beautiful watch face are not clearly delineated.,46944,3
46944,The instructions (in teensy print) aren't a bit clear.,46944,3
46944,"I wasn't sure what kind of stem I had - screwdown or other- and I'm still not sure what to do after not wearing my watch for a couple of days...
  All that being said, I am so relieved to have a beautiful watch with NO BATTERY that it makes up for all the other shortcomings- I THINK!",46944,3
46945,Will be sending it back.,46945,3
46946,The color is not like the photo.,46946,3
46946,The purple color is more like a light or soft lavender.,46946,3
46947,Cute hat but sort of an odd shape.,46947,3
46947,Got it for my 1 year old daughter and still pretty big on her.,46947,3
46948,Too see-through for a slip.,46948,3
46949,The necklace is pretty.,46949,3
46949,It's a heavier and thicker metal than I thought.,46949,3
46949,Not as delicate and dainty as I expected.,46949,3
46950,Beautiful shirt but runs small.,46950,3
46950,Son kept to wear under sweatshirt but fits like underwear and has very little stretch to the shirt.,46950,3
46951,I bought these pants to wear while I am in a cast from foot surgery.,46951,3
46951,"The fabric is heavy, fit is great except for the pant length.",46951,3
46951,The pant inseam is 34 inches.,46951,3
46951,Obviously I could not wear them after the surgery or risk tripping.,46951,3
46951,I had to shorten them to 31 inches.,46951,3
46952,"This ""swimsuit"" is only suitable for pictures only.",46952,3
46952,I would not recommend getting in a pool with this unless you're in a personal pool with your significant only,46952,3
46953,Rose broke off after three days on the bracelet.,46953,3
46953,The charm still looks wonderful with just the mask yhough,46953,3
46954,It's very pretty but it was too tight yet I usually wear a medium my zipper just busted from wearing it now I have to return it,46954,3
46955,I got a medium I'm usually S/M in USA.. need a bigger size.,46955,3
46955,If I don't move it fits perfect.,46955,3
46956,Product was late which was not good because I needed it for vacation and I didn't have it.,46956,3
46956,Also it may be oversized for a size 00 but it defintely doesn't fit the way it's pictures on a size 6.,46956,3
46956,"Nice light weight material though, just wish the arms were a bit longer and the neck was a bit wider like pictures.",46956,3
46956,For the price though I can't really complain much.,46956,3
46957,"The fit and style is great, the fabric feels nice...",46957,3
46957,BUT they are 100% see-through.,46957,3
46957,"You pretty much have to wear a tiny thong or no undies at all, you can see everything.",46957,3
46957,The seams have also already started to unravel in some places.,46957,3
46957,I gave this 3-stars bc of the smooth fabric.,46957,3
46957,"If it wasn't called a ""yoga"" pant it might work for lounging; definitely not for yoga or any other heavy workout.",46957,3
46958,I was stoked about getting this in.,46958,3
46958,"All of my s***'s tend to be large, so that's what I originally ordered.",46958,3
46958,"When it came in, it was too small due to my muscle gain, in the last 3 months.",46958,3
46958,"I sent it back, with no problem, and reordered it, but in the XL.",46958,3
46958,"It got to me one day sooner than noted, however, I didn't see one bit of differentce between the two sizes.",46958,3
46958,"I could barely get the waist portion, of the shirt, over my shoulders.",46958,3
46958,WAY smaller than what an XL should fit like.,46958,3
46958,"I'll send this one back and since an XL is the largest they have, I'll just go without.",46958,3
46959,A bit too short.,46959,3
46959,Not floor length as expected.,46959,3
46959,Right around the ankle.,46959,3
46959,"Material and stitching is good, but the bottom is a little bit see through and some people may prefer to wear a slip to be safe.",46959,3
46959,Overall dress was okay.,46959,3
46960,Too large around and did not hang properly.,46960,3
46961,"Horrible, ordered a 2x wear a M to L and the arms are so small the shoulders are cut narrow and it to my knees and I am 5'8",46961,3
46963,The fabric holds up.,46963,3
46963,but I would recommend going a size bigger than your usual one.,46963,3
46964,Really thin material and the print on the front wasn't the greatest.,46964,3
46964,Not super bright as depicted,46964,3
46965,Bought it because it said fits petite but it's to big,46965,3
46966,"The image shows the hat touching the ears, but the actual hat barely reaches the tip of the ear.",46966,3
46967,This was adorable at first until it got dirty and then I tried to wash it and it's made of cardboard covered in cloth obvioisly because now it's all mis-shapen.,46967,3
46967,Wouldn't let me charge my phone unless I slid it out of the case.,46967,3
46968,Fit was nice and as expected and this shirt is very comfortable.,46968,3
46968,"The main complaint is that the color is a much more aggressive pink/coral than what is represented in the ""peach"" color here.",46968,3
46969,Iblikwd it but after a few washes the beim desnt stay in place,46969,3
46970,I ordered an XL ended up giving to my daughter who wears a M.  Cute shirt though.,46970,3
46971,The watch size is perfect for a little kid and my son really enjoys the dial and trying to learn how to tell time (or for now just make it up).,46971,3
46971,However the strap leaves much to be desired.,46971,3
46971,I understand that it is not an expensive watch and that the strap certainly doesn't need to be something that looks particularly good but it has the cheapest rubber strap I have ever seen.,46971,3
46971,It is neither comfortable nor is it durable.,46971,3
46971,The strap keepers will just about slide off the buckle just by holding the watch by the bottom strap.,46971,3
46972,3 stars only because they all were black frames not mixed as shown.,46972,3
46974,Fits well but kinda shrunk after wash,46974,3
46975,Cute top but you can't wear a bra so I feel like you might be able to see my nipple on one side.,46975,3
46975,The wrap around strings are WAY too long.,46975,3
46975,I'll probably trim mine.,46975,3
46976,"This bracelet is pretty, but won't suit my needs.",46976,3
46976,Another review stated this bracelet is 1 1/2  inches wide.,46976,3
46976,I ordered based on that review.,46976,3
46976,My bracelet width is slightly over an 1 inch not quite 1 1/4.,46976,3
46976,It fit my 7 1/2 inch wrist without problems.,46976,3
46976,It is very malleable.,46976,3
46976,Not sure it would hold it's shape over time.,46976,3
46977,am expected a little  bigger,46977,3
46978,The Persun Grey V Neck Bodycon dress was comfortable to put on but larger than the size chart for my typical size.,46978,3
46978,The V neck was much lower than expected and I will have to wear a tank top under it or not only does my bra show but it looks odd on me.,46978,3
46978,The dress length was as described and I plan to wear it with leggings.,46978,3
46978,"The color is what I expected and looks nice, easy to dress up for a night out or wear casually.",46978,3
46979,"However, it is a beautiful dress for if I ever become the size of it",46979,3
46980,"Not what I was expecting it didn't cover very much in the front, length and material is great.",46980,3
46980,It is very beautiful but not so great if you're busty and looking for some coverage.,46980,3
46982,"I like the ring, it is a really good quality, but it is kind of large and looks weird on my belly button, but my roommate has a larger belly button and it looked good on her.",46982,3
46983,They were just a little bit to small.,46983,3
46983,Just didn't think it was worth sending back with the price of shipping.,46983,3
46984,Manufactured for someone with skinny legs.,46984,3
46984,I can't get them up over my calves.,46984,3
46984,They are quite a bit narrower than other SockItToMe socks I have.,46984,3
46985,You get what you pay for of course so I can't really complain.,46985,3
46985,One of the zippers broke in the first two weeks.,46985,3
46985,Smelled awful for a couple of weeks- afraid to know what chemicals are used.,46985,3
46986,"Adorable but snaps keep coming open so will probably never wear again, sadly because it's adorable",46986,3
46987,They didn't fit they way I needed them to over my stomach and back some,46987,3
46988,Purse is okay cheap lining on the inside of purse.,46988,3
46989,Worked for my costume but shed all over the place!,46989,3
46990,smaller than I thought,46990,3
46991,Very cute but very thin,46991,3
46992,Just a touch smaller than I expected but super comfy.,46992,3
46992,Pocket barely fits my IPhone 6 but I was able to make it work.,46992,3
46993,"These look great on, but feel very VERY cheap.",46993,3
46993,It was a little disappointing.,46993,3
46994,Would be great had it fit.,46994,3
46994,"Got a 6xl for my boyfriend who normally wears 6xl, but it was too small",46994,3
46995,Can not fairly rate the shoe...size too small.,46995,3
46995,Ordered same pair in full size larger.,46995,3
46995,Wait until those arrive and I can answer other questions fairly.,46995,3
46996,I do not care for the material and it hugs my body too much.,46996,3
46996,it is not as attractive as it shows.,46996,3
46996,It looks like it has some cotton or knit and it is not so.,46996,3
46997,not true to size but otherwise I like it.,46997,3
46998,Wanted to like it - but was just too weird and tight to wear.,46998,3
46999,Would be nice but fit very small.,46999,3
46999,"Beware this product is not ""big girl"" friendly.",46999,3
46999,"I would love it for work attire, true to its description as thin; perfect for spring/summer",46999,3
47000,Is a nice t-shirt.,47000,3
47000,"The problem is the size, I'm size Large and I order XL an is still small for me.",47000,3
47001,Okay - nothing spectacular other than pockets,47001,3
47002,CHEAP & Mass Produced.,47002,3
47002,Another COMPANY  Of SENDING The US HARD WORKED DOLLAR TO CHINA TO SUPPORT AGGRESSION  AGAINST US PUBLIC & KEEPING US LABOR OUT OF WORK.,47002,3
47003,"I usually wear a small (5'5"", 118lbs, long torso) but I ordered this in a medium based off the other reviews and I think that was the right choice.",47003,3
47003,"The medium is a bit roomy but that's how a sweatshirt should fit I think, plus the sleeves are the perfect length on me in the medium (I like sleeves to come down well past my wrist).",47003,3
47003,"At first I was pretty happy with this when I tried it on, the bottom band wasn't too tight (a common problem for me as my hips are disproportionately large compared to the rest of my body), length was good, the lining felt cozy and warm (though it did have a slight smell of something not very nice.... but I'm sure that would come out after the first wash), and I like the little ""leather"" details around the strings on the hood.",47003,3
47003,But right before I ripped the tags off and threw it in the wash I tried putting the hood on and to my dismay it was WAY too short!,47003,3
47003,"I've never had this happen before, and I wear a LOT of hooded sweaters, so I don't think it's due to my head size.",47003,3
47003,Pic attached so you can sort of see how much the shoulders of the sweater get pulled up when I have the hood on.,47003,3
47003,"The hood would need *at least* an extra 3 inches of length, if not more, to be comfortable.",47003,3
47003,"When I put the hood on, the entire weight of the sweater gets pulled on my head, since the entire sweater gets pulled off my shoulders, and it would definitely give me a headache after awhile.",47003,3
47003,I actually use the hoods on my sweaters as I find it's the fastest way to warm up/keep warm when it's cold (the reason for buying this sweater) so not being able to use the hood makes this a no-go for me.,47003,3
47003,"If you just want a warm zip up sweatshirt and don't have any interest in using the hood, then I would still recommend this (in a size up from your usual size).",47003,3
47003,But if you planned on using the hood I'd keep looking.,47003,3
47004,"Cute swimsuit, but not lined very well for a white suit.",47004,3
47004,It's also very long and I'm not shirtwaisted.,47004,3
47004,I'm going to keep it and see if it can be altered a bit.,47004,3
47005,"Good product, good quality, but not like top of the line jerseys.",47005,3
47007,I like it and people say it's sexy and cute but it does run a little small.,47007,3
47007,I ordered a 2nd one a size up from my usual and it's better.,47007,3
47007,I usually run as a medium but that fit as a small..so I ordered a large and it fit like a Medium  (US Sizes).,47007,3
47007,Overall happy with it however the shoulder pieces look a little cheap,47007,3
47008,The product is exactly the same as seen in the picture.,47008,3
47008,I bought a 2xl for my sister however it was extremely small for a child.,47008,3
47008,Besides size great product,47008,3
47009,"Adhesive sticks decently, but between the ""petals"" it sticks up so you see little bumps if you're wearing a thin shirt.",47009,3
47010,They are made very thin and it actually fits too loose I am an actual 1x in size!,47010,3
47011,The top was to large and the skirt fit great.,47011,3
47011,I will alter the dress on top because the dress is cute.,47011,3
47012,Decent jersey for the price.,47012,3
47012,Not at the quality of an Adidas or Nike jersey and not as fitted but still looks good.,47012,3
47013,Not very good quality,47013,3
47014,"This is a light saber, not clothing so asking how it fits doesn't apply...",47014,3
47014,But I'm not impressed with the way the light saber is held in when not in use by a cheap plastic little thing that broke the first time it was played with.,47014,3
47014,What happened to hitting the button to release the saber?,47014,3
47014,That worked much better in my opinion.,47014,3
47014,But overall my son loves it!,47014,3
47015,We have ordered this dress in 3 different sizes and still have not found the one for us.,47015,3
47015,The first one we got in was so lovely.,47015,3
47015,"The color was great, the material was great, the dress was perfect except for the size.",47015,3
47015,"Even after looking at the chart and taking her measurements, the size was not right.",47015,3
47015,"So we ordered the next size down...the color was not as rich, the material was scratchy, it was sewn together completely different and it was still too big.",47015,3
47015,So we ordered another size down and unfortunately got the same poor quality as the second one.,47015,3
47015,"If we could somehow get one JUST like the first one only smaller it would be great, but it seems there is no guarantee even when ordered from the same place.",47015,3
47016,Nice skirt but to small,47016,3
47017,Hurt to put it and wouldn't even go all the way through.,47017,3
47017,Maybe that's my fault for not getting the correct size though.,47017,3
47018,Cute but the fabric is ok. After washing once the fabric is not so good.,47018,3
47018,I was expecting more since it is Leveret.,47018,3
47019,I purchased this bathing suit for which fits.,47019,3
47019,I am a size 6-8 dependent on clothing and ordered large bathing suit.,47019,3
47019,Heavy chested but remaining torso/bottom average.,47019,3
47019,The product states 6-8 medium.,47019,3
47019,If would have ordered the medium probably would have been tight.,47019,3
47019,Bathing suit pretty but not the easiest to put on.,47019,3
47020,Fox Pom to small  does not stand up.,47020,3
47021,Jacket arrived as advertised with laughable advertising in broken english.,47021,3
47021,Heavier than I would have thought for cotton/polyester.,47021,3
47021,"Clearly a product for he Asian market as sizing is a whole too small but as long as buyer is aware, its not a bad value.",47021,3
47022,I gave as a gift since it didn't fit the person intended for.,47022,3
47023,"Cute, but runs small.",47023,3
47024,I didn't want stretch cotton but it was my fault but I gave them to my daughter and she loved them,47024,3
47026,Good buy however i bought it to match a sneaker to wear for my birthday Aug 27th but the color was not true to color.,47026,3
47026,Im very disappointed and since it cost more to return i deserve some sort of compensation.,47026,3
47027,Needed a slip under it,47027,3
47028,I was really nervous about buying this bathing suit after all the reviews but I did my measurements and matched it up with the chart provided and it fits perfectly.,47028,3
47028,Not to mention it arrived very fast which was totally unexpected.,47028,3
47028,Arrived in 1 week despite the 3-5week expectation I was given.,47028,3
47028,Very sad though the clasp on the straps broke :/ went to return it and the company gave me a full refund.,47028,3
47028,Very pleased would buy from them again.,47028,3
47029,This dress is as pictured and a good fit and looks the same on.,47029,3
47029,The lace sleeves are made from a stretchy elastic material.,47029,3
47029,My concern is that after wearing and cleaning for the first time the sleeves may start to unravel.,47029,3
47029,You can see the potential for that to happen since there is no border stitching on the edge of the sleeves.,47029,3
47029,They are just cut in a curving shaped edge.,47029,3
47030,Nice jacket but too small,47030,3
47031,Very good quality.....cap is more for a childs head size....,47031,3
47032,"I'm 6'4"" and weigh 230.",47032,3
47032,My waist is 40.,47032,3
47032,"The ones I received were probably for a 36"" waist.",47032,3
47032,The fabric and style was exactly what I wanted.,47032,3
47033,Kind of ridiculous how large (wide) this shirt is.,47033,3
47033,It's cut like a square.,47033,3
47033,I can't wear it for work but lounging around the house is fine.,47033,3
47034,This came quite short and I feel as though it will show my tummy if I raise my arms.,47034,3
47034,Totally not my thing.,47034,3
47035,"The shirt is way too big, I would suggest you order smaller sizes if you want it to fit now.",47035,3
47036,I order XL and they were too tight and small for my waist (34).,47036,3
47036,"Also, pouch is quite small too.",47036,3
47037,It's awkward and makes me looks gross...wish it fit better.,47037,3
47037,I shipped super quick though!,47037,3
47038,My breast were too big.,47038,3
47038,They looked mashed down.,47038,3
47038,I guess I should have ordered a size up.,47038,3
47039,"It looks very nice and fits well, but the fabric is very strange.",47039,3
47039,"It says it has cotton with the polyester, but it feels like it's 100% polyester and it's thick too.",47039,3
47039,It feels like something my grandmother would have worn.,47039,3
47039,Quality seems to be good and fits as expected.,47039,3
47040,"These are just basic over the knee socks, though they feel slightly heavier in the material then other socks I have.",47040,3
47040,so Honest opinion #buyifyouwant,47040,3
47041,You will need a slip underneath it.,47041,3
47042,This dress runs smaller.,47042,3
47042,It looks more of a jr dress.,47042,3
47043,Something was amiss with the clasp.,47043,3
47043,"Son fixed it, this was a gift to grand child, and all seems well.",47043,3
47044,I wanted a pair of camouflage pattern pants for use when riding my mountain bike.,47044,3
47044,"Needed pants that are snug near the ankles, so as to prevent catching of fabric in the bike's chain drive.",47044,3
47044,"The product page in Amazon advised that the sizing was for the Chinese market, and to order ONE size larger than your usual.",47044,3
47044,"So I ordered what was advertised as men's size L. At that time, the ad did not read China L or US S. I received a garment that was labeled L. When layed flat on a table top, it's dimensions are as follows:

Unstretched waist: 13 1/4"" across (therefore 26 1/2"")
Stretched waist:18"" across (therefore 36"")
Inseam: 28 1/2""
Overall length from top of waist to bottom of leg: 38""

My waist measures 35"" at the navel.",47044,3
47044,"I normally wear slacks of waist size 34, which tend to fit me a bit loose.",47044,3
47044,"I am height 6'0"" and have an athletic build; only about 16% body fat.",47044,3
47044,"These pants, although expandable to a waist 36"" fit me ridiculously tight; This is due to the skinny fit around the upper and lower legs, and especially over the buttox.",47044,3
47044,My wife joked that it was so tight on me that it looked like something that a gay person might wear :-)  So I'm donating them to Goodwill.,47044,3
47044,"Apart from the sizing issue, it is actually VERY WELL MADE.",47044,3
47044,"The bottom of the legs have brass zipper closures to enable the bottoms to open for getting the pants on/off, and then to close for a snug fit where its needed at the bottom for bike riding.",47044,3
47044,Excellent design and construction for mountain biking!,47044,3
47044,"I just needed one size larger than was advertised and labeled, that's all.",47044,3
47044,If the vendor would offer one size larger (a true US men's size M) then I would certainly try ordering this item again (with my fingers crossed).,47044,3
47044,"With proper sizing for the American market, I could've rated this product 5 stars.",47044,3
47045,I expected this item to be a sweater and was disappointed when I found it  be a sweatshirt.,47045,3
47045,It was a coarse material - maybe a couple of washes will soften it.,47045,3
47046,Dose not show that there is a white threading in the back that runs the whole leg.,47046,3
47047,"As mentioned, this IS a very sturdy, good looking bag.",47047,3
47047,"The deal breaker for me, however, for any handbag is the zipper: You have to hold the fabric end of it to zip it up.",47047,3
47047,I am a lazy bones and need to have the zipper be a one-handed operation kind of thing.,47047,3
47047,"So, returned the bag.",47047,3
47047,"Also worth mentioning is that this bag, like some of this brand's bags, is very stiff.",47047,3
47047,"I'm sure with use it might loosen up but at this size, its a little like carrying around a briefcase.",47047,3
47047,"Too bad, the quilting is quite nice.",47047,3
47047,"Instead I got a different Travelon two pocket bag that has a zipper sewed onto the bag, and is less stiff.",47047,3
47048,See through fabric in junior size.,47048,3
47048,Should not be labeled as women's.,47048,3
47049,I got this for my husband and he loved it BUT it wasn't very functional and couldn't hold his 4 cards so I ended up getting him another more practical one.,47049,3
47049,For what it is though he loved the quirkiness of it because hes a bit of a nerd :) Its a really cool concept and sleek looking product but not very functional.,47049,3
47050,Nice and cute !,47050,3
47051,The hat was bigger than expected.,47051,3
47052,Color was not white - more of an ivory.,47052,3
47052,Material is not what I expected.,47052,3
47053,Not quite as happy with how fast one of the spokes gave way.,47053,3
47054,"It's a fun little costume, but the shorts are ridiculous!",47054,3
47054,"They are made for a child, I gave them to a 12 year old.",47054,3
47054,You'll have to buy something separate to wear instead if you plan to wear it outside of the bedroom.,47054,3
47055,"Other reviewers have said this top runs small, so I ordered a 2XL, although I normal would just order XL.",47055,3
47055,They were right - it is small.,47055,3
47055,The 2XL just fit with no room to spare.,47055,3
47055,The top is also very thin - will definitely need a cami underneath.,47055,3
47055,But the color and craftsmanship are good.,47055,3
47056,I'm a size 10 and I purchased a Large.,47056,3
47056,It fit perfect until I washed it in cold water and hung dry and it still shrunk a bit.,47056,3
47056,The waste band cuts into my stomach.,47056,3
47056,The fabric is a tad scratchy so I would suggest not purchasing if you are sensitive to fabrics.,47056,3
47057,Size run small but great material,47057,3
47058,Not as great a fit as others I have bought on Amazon.,47058,3
47058,Material is very light and I am not sure if it will hold up.,47058,3
47058,It will take many times wearing this before I can really make a good comment.,47058,3
47059,"Fit as expected, and super cute style, the only thing that disappoints me is that the material is super thin, just about see-through.",47059,3
47059,Normally I don't mind wearing  a cami underneath a top but I don't know how I'm going to that with this design.,47059,3
47060,"the hat is too large for me, it fits, but it still is too large, but no biggie, that's what happens when you buy stuff that you should buy in person in a store,so you can see the fit first.",47060,3
47061,Fiiting as described by reviewes (order one size-up).,47061,3
47061,I'm bit disappointed though as I thought I had seen 'a set 3' in the header description and thought it was a set of 3 t-shirts.,47061,3
47062,Do not purchase this belt.,47062,3
47062,"I was really excited to finally have a belt that I could adjust to my exact size, but I was extremely disappointed by this purchase for a two reasons.",47062,3
47062,1) the mechanism to allow the belt to release to take it off is very fickle...,47062,3
47062,It's take some fidgeting around and a bunch of tries with it to get it to fully push down and release.,47062,3
47062,It was extremely frustrating to take on and off even after just trying it on for the first time.,47062,3
47062,2) the product looks nothing like the picture shown here.,47062,3
47062,The buckle in the photo looks to be shiny and a nice metal; all and all sharp looking with straight edges.,47062,3
47062,That's not what the belt actually looks like.,47062,3
47062,"In actuality, the belt buckle is a bit curved around the sides, detracted from the sharp appearance you might be looking for in a belt.",47062,3
47062,"In addition, the metal has a dull and nearly shineless finish.",47062,3
47062,All in all it was a very bad purchase and I regret spending any money on this belt.,47062,3
47062,"I don't know the company's return policy, but I will certainly reach out to them to try to find out if I can return this belt and get my money back...

To follow up - The company was extremely gracious and fully reimbursed me for my purchase.",47062,3
47062,They were super nice and a pleasure to speak to.,47062,3
47062,I admit that it could have been that I received a faulty belt since their mechanisms do usually work according to most of the reviews.,47062,3
47062,"So based on their amazing customer service, I actually think this product deserves two more stars since I imagine the product is usually better than the one I received and they are so easy and good to work with.",47062,3
47063,The material is warm but the velcro is harsh and the cap keeps rotating sideways every time my baby turns his head into the stroller.,47063,3
47063,Have to adjust it multiple times on each ride out.,47063,3
47063,"Plus, I do feel that the front area, from the forehead should be a little more open to make it a better fit.",47063,3
47063,"The way it is right now, the velcro cannot be fully tightened.",47063,3
47063,I'm going to be looking for a better cap.,47063,3
47063,Mitten's are okay though.,47063,3
47064,"The dress is very pretty, but it is sized for a child.",47064,3
47064,I measured and ordered a size large for my 11 year old who wears a girls size 14/16 since this was asian sizing.,47064,3
47064,"The size large would fit a child size 8, the length is ridiculous so even if my child was thin enough it would essentially be a shirt.",47064,3
47064,This should be sold as a childs item,47064,3
47065,It flattened my chest.,47065,3
47065,It may look better in a bigger size but it's just not what I expected so I'll be returning it.,47065,3
47065,It does flow well.,47065,3
47065,The elastic waiste was a little high on me.,47065,3
47065,"I'm 5'3"" 160lbs and got a large - should have went with xl but don't think I would love it even in a bigger size.",47065,3
47065,The hidden zipper goes down past the butt and can get stuck when zipping it past the elastic waste.,47065,3
47066,I'd recommend ordering one possibly two sizes bigger than what you wear.,47066,3
47066,It is made from Halloween costume material.,47066,3
47066,So tent like materials not soft fabric.,47066,3
47066,It barely fit my daughter but worked for a one night wear on Halloween.,47066,3
47066,It is short and multiple pieces.,47066,3
47067,It's watch springs - how much review can you do?,47067,3
47068,This is really cute.,47068,3
47068,My 2 year old will love it.,47068,3
47068,The reason I only have three stars is because when it was delivered the green centers of the fliers had already fallen off.,47068,3
47068,"It looked cute without it, so I didn't return it or glue them back on.",47068,3
47070,I wanted one soo bad but it was too small,47070,3
47071,thin fabric and a bit large,47071,3
47072,I am only giving this 3 stars because I feel like this item is overpriced.,47072,3
47072,"I understand you as a costumer need to pay for shipping, time to make the product, etc.",47072,3
47072,I just think this should be around $20-$30.,47072,3
47072,"However, I am excited to try this in October on my wedding day.",47072,3
47072,I feel like I will be happy with it and it will make using the restroom easier.,47072,3
47073,Much shorter than expected.,47073,3
47073,"Can't actually wear as a dress and I'm only 5'4"".",47073,3
47073,"Will be cute with tights, or as a swimsuit coverup though.",47073,3
47074,I like this ok.,47074,3
47074,"The grey color isn't really grey, more purple brownish.",47074,3
47074,The zipper to close it is a little weird.,47074,3
47074,Way bigger than I thought it would be.,47074,3
47077,"As far as just fitting it was fine, I did order a size larger though.",47077,3
47077,I'm 5'8 and a size 14/16 and usually wear either a L of Xl so I got the XXL.,47077,3
47077,"It is however very short, I wonder if the 3x would have maybe been longer.",47077,3
47077,"The cups definitely aren't made for larger breasts, Im a 38DD, but I can say they fit better than any of my Victoria secret lingerie.",47077,3
47077,"The material is fairly stretchy and I had no problems of it ripping, as some reviews had mentioned.",47077,3
47077,"The g string is the same horrible one you get with all lingerie and the ""handcuffs"" are to lace circles connected with stretchy string.",47077,3
47077,"You definitely get what you pay for, but it is still pretty cute.",47077,3
47078,The size was a little tight in the sleeves.,47078,3
47079,Really cute BUT it runs about 2 sizes too small.,47079,3
47079,"I usually order an XL, ordered a Red one in a 2xl (because the reviews said it runs small) and it was really tight so I ordered this color in a 3xl and it fits.",47079,3
47080,I didn't expect the material to be like that and the shirt is a see through- besides that I like it,47080,3
47081,These are cute but the stones that are clear crystal in the picture are actually grey :( they do not work with the dress I had in mind,47081,3
47082,I really like this.,47082,3
47082,Only thing is that it tangles up quickly.,47082,3
47083,"I knew from a previous post that the decals were just ""sticker"" like and not stitched badges.",47083,3
47083,I am ok with that when the price is low enough for an anime series that doesn't have clothing sold everywhere.,47083,3
47083,"However, the quality of the sweatshirt itself is bad.",47083,3
47083,"It balls up and looks ragged already, and I have had it about 3 months and only worn/washed it about 4 times.",47083,3
47083,"the decals still look great, but the sweatshirt does not.",47083,3
47084,Color was not correct.,47084,3
47084,Thought it was a very light pink.,47084,3
47085,Bracelet arrived with wires poking out - cut my skin before I noticed - snagged a sweater.,47085,3
47085,"For the money, and after I got out precision pliers and modified the problem it's ok - It is pretty",47085,3
47086,very tight in the chest.,47086,3
47086,fabric is like spandex.,47086,3
47087,Large size is too small for 180 lbs and 6' man.,47087,3
47088,Comes from China so it takes a while to get.,47088,3
47088,Just hope it's not loaded with lead.,47088,3
47088,It is a nice necklace and came with two chains.,47088,3
47089,Good light weight material however the sizes run small.,47089,3
47089,If you have muscular hiking quads you may want to go up two sizes!,47089,3
47090,It was too small for my needs.,47090,3
47091,There was only a finger loop on one side and that one was to small for even my pinky!,47091,3
47091,They are pretty and easy to store away though.,47091,3
47092,The swimsuit itself is very pretty but I gave it 3 stars because it didn't fit my thighs,47092,3
47093,Very cute and well made but way too small.,47093,3
47093,I recommend to order a size up.,47093,3
47094,Nice jacket but way to big.,47094,3
47094,The biggest problem was the sleeve length.,47094,3
47094,"Although it was well priced ($69.99), I was forced to return this jacket.",47094,3
47094,"Surprisingly, the XL version of this jacket, from the same vendor, is priced at $99.99.",47094,3
47094,I don't understand the exaggerated price difference.,47094,3
47095,during  his Christmas play at school.,47095,3
47095,"The hat is made thin and the beard is short, thin and not curly.",47095,3
47095,It is like the manufacture stretched out a lot of large cotton balls to make the beard.,47095,3
47095,I wouldn't recommend anyone tugging on this Santa's beard.,47095,3
47095,The hat and beard is too small for an adult male but might be ok for a petite female.,47095,3
47095,Otherwise I think this definitely should be a children's hat and beard.,47095,3
47095,I would buy again for just under $7 still knowing it probably won't hold up past next Christmas.,47095,3
47096,Color was more turquoise than green which disappointed me,47096,3
47098,Really really cute coat for the price.,47098,3
47098,Nice quality decent jacket but the size is very very small I am normally a small/medium in women's so I ordered a large and it still too small.,47098,3
47098,I can barely wear it.,47098,3
47098,"So if your thinking about ordering this coat and you're under roughly 175lbs, do it, super  cute and good quality jacket",47098,3
47099,"I normally wear medium, medium is a little snug.",47099,3
47099,I would go up a size.,47099,3
47101,"Somewhat smaller than I expected & I ordered a size up, I do love the back design I get tons of compliments!",47101,3
47103,my rings came in yesterday and they are cute but they do not look like the masks on the picture.,47103,3
47103,you would think that the green section of the mask is rhinestones but it is not it has more of a glittery appearance and is not rhinestones.,47103,3
47103,The bar was also incredibly tiny and this is coming from a person with A cups so imagine how it would be on a regular sized nipple.,47103,3
47103,The mask is still cute though I wouldn't stop any one from buying it just have your own bar ready.,47103,3
47104,I ordered a medium and they actually sent me a large.,47104,3
47104,Which is actually a good thing since the medium would have been too small.,47104,3
47104,This shirt is okay.,47104,3
47104,"I like my crops to be a little longer, so that my high waisted shorts cover my tummy.",47104,3
47104,but this shirt is very crop!,47104,3
47104,which is okay if that's what you want.,47104,3
47104,I would just prefer it to be a little longer.,47104,3
47104,But it will do!,47104,3
47105,I ordered this for my daughter at her choosing and is reviewed by her notes.,47105,3
47105,"I thought the price was fair but arrival was about two weeks, still faster than quoted.",47105,3
47105,"The Pros: Comfortable, forming tapered cut, unique design.",47105,3
47105,"The Cons: Hood is smaller than desired, Gathered lint easily, Zipper is poor quality and broke after two weeks, there are no pockets and the pattern is ""shimmery and scratchy"" For any questions, feel free to write.",47105,3
47106,great bag other than the outside pockets are so narrow they're useless.,47106,3
47106,I thought I'd use them for a bottle of water but way too slim for that.,47106,3
47106,I do like the fabric.,47106,3
47106,It seems to be quite durable.,47106,3
47107,Returned one because zipper broke.,47107,3
47107,Second one's zipper sticks at the corner so I can't close it all the way.,47107,3
47109,"Shirt was really cute, but it was way too big for my daughter -- had to return.",47109,3
47110,"Would be good for short, chubby babies.",47110,3
47110,"It's about as wide as it is long, in the ""86"" size anyways.",47110,3
47110,Will be turning it into a shirt for my string-bean son to wear next year!,47110,3
47111,"Thought medium would be right for me, but it is a bit on the small side.",47111,3
47111,I should have ordered a large.,47111,3
47111,"Other than that, the hat is well made and is nice looking.",47111,3
47112,"neck is really big though,prepare to wear a tank underneath as material is see through.",47112,3
47112,Super cute design and I love it.,47112,3
47113,"I ordered the red, and expected the torso to be white and sparkly like in the image.",47113,3
47113,The torso was read with silver sparkly things.,47113,3
47114,"It's a nice jacket, but it fits a little tight across my shoulders.",47114,3
47114,"The buttons are a bit flashy for me too, but again, I won't be returning it.",47114,3
47115,Cute summer-to-fall night life throw on.,47115,3
47115,However the seems tell-tale it was put together without quality assurance.,47115,3
47115,"If I cld fit it (US 8 - Asan XL), I'd enjoy it for the price.",47115,3
47115,"But returning it to exchange for a XXL is kind of insulting, e.g., Seller, ""Return to Asia at your expense or $5 refund and give it to a friend.""",47115,3
47115,Assuming I had a friend w/ this taste to give it to.,47115,3
47115,Guess I'll hang it on my wall as an incentive to lose weight and perhaps fit it sometime in the future.,47115,3
47116,I bought these for my wedding.,47116,3
47116,Theyre pretty but didn't wow me.,47116,3
47116,I have small lobes and they hang down.,47116,3
47116,So you can't really see them well.,47116,3
47116,Ok for every day.,47116,3
47117,The shirt texture is nice and smooth but my main complaint is the capt America shield is basically a thick iron-on.,47117,3
47117,Not what I was expecting.,47117,3
47118,Too tight in legs and too lose in breast.,47118,3
47118,Even though I'm DD size.,47118,3
47119,This product would have been perfect if there was a good size chart.,47119,3
47119,"I looked up the website and ended up ordering the largest one because I have a very large chest, 44DDD (5'7"" 210 size 18 1-2x).",47119,3
47119,When this was completely closed it would literally fall right off.,47119,3
47119,I believe I should have gotten a 3 or 4 maybe.,47119,3
47120,"Not as pictured, a7x symbol is not a piece of fabric or a patch but rather cheaply printed on, much darker and it is less quality than portrayed.",47120,3
47120,Would rather have bought a generic hat and put an avenged patch on it.,47120,3
47121,It's alright for the price.,47121,3
47121,Deff too small tho,47121,3
47122,Liked the design and style but was too small for me,47122,3
47123,"For the price, they're fine.",47123,3
47123,"Bought two pairs, in series.",47123,3
47123,First one lasted a year before the frame broke.,47123,3
47123,Second one broke in the same way after 3 months.,47123,3
47125,These were huge on me.,47125,3
47125,but It made me seems artsy as hell.,47125,3
47126,I ordered an XL and it was more like a small,47126,3
47127,It's cute and lite weight but runs small.,47127,3
47127,Wasn't able to wear it but cute enough to give as a gift.,47127,3
47128,Fits a little loose but that's the style.,47128,3
47128,I didn't like the way it fit on me so I'm returning it but it may be great for someone with more curves than I have :),47128,3
47130,The bottom part fit with my hips but the top part was way too large.,47130,3
47130,"If I got the next size smaller, It would be too tight in the hips and probably would fit in the top part.",47130,3
47130,I got a larger size based on the reviews and that the outfit was made in China.,47130,3
47130,It also seemed uncomfortable on my skin.,47130,3
47130,It was itchy to me.,47130,3
47130,"I am 5' 7"" and 140 pounds and I work out so the fit was off.",47130,3
47131,It is ok but fringes tangle in the water,47131,3
47132,"cant get in it, its too small :(",47132,3
47133,Its a exact replica which is great.,47133,3
47133,Just like the one he wore in the movie.,47133,3
47133,However for a medium it was more like a large.,47133,3
47133,Even after it shrunk.,47133,3
47134,Good value for money... a bit small,47134,3
47135,I bought three of these as inexpensive Christmas gifts for my friends.,47135,3
47135,"They look cheaply made and the watch part didn't work on any of them, but they are still cute and I can't complain too much for the price.",47135,3
47136,Basically just a big t-shirt.,47136,3
47136,"It was more loose than I expected so it's not flattering, but whatever, it's comfortable",47136,3
47137,I thought the sleeves would be a little wider.,47137,3
47138,I like the idea behind this belt.,47138,3
47138,"However, although it is stylish in its minimalism it is very impractical with regards to function.",47138,3
47138,"Despite the Grip6 marketing material that this belt ""holds tight all day"", that was not at all my experience upon first wearing this belt.",47138,3
47138,I was constantly tightening it on pants where traditional belts have always been less fussy and largely forgotten.,47138,3
47138,If you are looking for a belt that serves its intended purpose - to hold your pants in place - then move on.,47138,3
47138,I'd much rather wear a traditional belt that is both stylish and practical.,47138,3
47138,"If your pants are tailored to fit you perfectly and you are looking for a belt that provides form over function, then this might be the belt for you.",47138,3
47138,"That said, I would NEVER wear this with a suit for business purposes (as some reviewers have commented) as it is far too casual in appearance (which you could gather from the pictures).",47138,3
47138,My intended purpose was for casual wear.,47138,3
47138,"However, I'd much rather wear a D-ring belt for casual wear or a versatile, traditional belt.",47138,3
47138,"Overall I would not purchase this again, nor would I recommend it, especially considering the price point and the many shortfalls that come with the Grip6 belt.",47138,3
47139,Buy larger than you think unless you want it fitted,47139,3
47140,Daughter bought for summer vacation.,47140,3
47141,"You advertised these were high rise jeans and I really wanted high rise jeans, but the front is too low.",47141,3
47141,I am 78 years old and the low rise jeans just don't work for me..,47141,3
47142,It was raised in the front and longer in the back it shoes as regular tshirt,47142,3
47143,Disappointed...I love print but I expected it to be bigger.,47143,3
47143,Description does not give dimensions either.,47143,3
47143,Stash implies larger bag and I planned to use as makeup bag but its coin sized.,47143,3
47143,My key chain with two keys barely fit.,47143,3
47144,These tennis shoes are cute and my daughter says they're comfortable so I'm giving them 3 stars BUT after only 3 months the lights in one shoe no longer work.,47144,3
47144,The wire snapped inside the shoe so it can no longer be charged.,47144,3
47144,This is disappointing seeing as that's the main point of this kind of shoe.,47144,3
47145,The bottom part sticks out on the left side further then the top part.,47145,3
47145,Just looks awkward and not made right.,47145,3
47146,"The headbands were a perfect size for our 2-year-old daughter, we loved the variety of colors, and she was very excited to start wearing them.",47146,3
47146,"Unfortunately, the colored part of the purple headband (her favorite color) started unraveling the second time she wore it...we tried fixing it, but then it unraveled from the other side.",47146,3
47146,"For the price, we're quite disappointed that this didn't last longer.",47146,3
47146,"So far the other 8 headbands appear fine, but we're worried about how long they will last.",47146,3
47147,"Its beautiful, but not for big breasted women.",47147,3
47148,"This dress is branded as body con, and boy, is it.",47148,3
47148,I ordered a size up and it was still a bit too tight for me (although some may like that).,47148,3
47148,The fabric is thinnish so pretty unforgiving if you have lumps and bumps and don't wear Spanx with it.,47148,3
47148,"But, at the price point, its not bad.",47148,3
47149,Sleeves are quite long in contrast to its size,47149,3
47151,Cute dress - too small in chest area for a size large.,47151,3
47151,Had to return item.,47151,3
47152,Colors are not what expected.. fits way small!,47152,3
47153,I'm a short girl with a smaller chest and I got the smallest size and it was way to long and the chest was to large.,47153,3
47153,I got it to work but I only used it once,47153,3
47154,Nice but a bit fitted for the size,47154,3
47155,"I normally wear small or xsmall, I read the reviews online and bought a medium thinking that I may need a medium based on what people said, its TOO big!",47155,3
47155,Medium is actually like a large for stores H&M and Forever 21.,47155,3
47155,"Its very cute though, I wish that size wasn't an issue and I could return for a smaller size.",47155,3
47156,"I usually wear a large, and after reading the reviews here I ordered a 5x.",47156,3
47156,It just smelled REALLY bad when I got it.,47156,3
47157,My daughter loves it,47157,3
47158,These earrings are gorgeous & I love them.,47158,3
47158,The only thing I would critique are the posts.,47158,3
47158,They need better posts because they are heavy & the posts that come with them slide off & the earrings come out.,47158,3
47158,The metal tarnishes fast too.,47158,3
47158,I don't think they are worth $30.,47158,3
47160,"Material is very thin, cheaply made!",47160,3
47160,I ordered 2 skirts and a dress from Amazon and they are all very THIN AND CHEAP LOOKING.,47160,3
47160,I will most likely give them all away ... not happy with the clothes so far!,47160,3
47161,"Beautiful Outfit, but the stitched on bear started coming off after 1 wash...",47161,3
47162,its cute BUT it doesn't fit properly if you need a small.,47162,3
47162,I ordered because I was told the one size fit all would fit because of the corset back BUT it doesn't because when I pull the strings tight enough where it fits then you cant even see the corset in the back because the strings are all pulled tight in order for it to fit.,47162,3
47162,IF YOU NEED A SMALL DON'T BUY,47162,3
47163,Would definitely recommend moving up a size or two.,47163,3
47163,"The pattern is very cute however, and I can still wear it, but it doesn't fit perfectly.",47163,3
47164,Print on this shirt looks not quality.,47164,3
47164,Looks faded when it was not supposed to be.,47164,3
47164,Tight in the arms.,47164,3
47164,Overall its not too bad.,47164,3
47166,But the cape made from such a sitff material that it would not go into the shape needed.,47166,3
47167,Not high quality and will definitely lose its shape.,47167,3
47167,Too bad because the fit is ok.,47167,3
47169,I loved this online.,47169,3
47169,I had to order it...,47169,3
47169,When I recieved this the item color and item was exact to what was shown online but had a unique odor.,47169,3
47169,Still I tried it on now the top fit perfect but the bottoms WAY to small.,47169,3
47169,If you have a tiny bottom I recommed this if not I suggest maybe looking for something bigger.,47169,3
47169,I gave 3stars because I do still very much like this item just without the odor and luckily I wear shorts ontop of my bottom bathing suit anyway.,47169,3
47169,I just want to add that after I sent an email about the issue I received a response right away.,47169,3
47169,Thet helped me resolve the problem.,47169,3
47170,Had to send the first pair back because they had a hole in them!,47170,3
47170,Easy return and I was sent another pair.,47170,3
47170,I ordered a size much larger than I normally wear because I'm tall and didn't want to struggle with pulling them up.,47170,3
47170,They turned out to be quite roomy.,47170,3
47170,"Had I wanted these for something other than a costume that is okay to have tears and runs in, I would consider these to not be well enough made.",47170,3
47170,"If they have a hole before they are out of the bag, they probably aren't going to last long.",47170,3
47170,"That being said, they were the best I could find, at the price, that weren't made for a short person.",47170,3
47171,Clicker was way too short.,47171,3
47171,"Cute ring, I wish I could have worn it.",47171,3
47171,"Silver did not look authentic, returned.",47171,3
47172,too tight to wear in public but still cute if you don't have a large butt,47172,3
47173,Hair ties slip off these easily.,47173,3
47174,Not actual swim trunks but they are great for cosplay.,47174,3
47175,"For this being marketed for men, the eye patch is not big at all.",47175,3
47175,"In addition, it's quite hard and not comfortable at all....thought it would be felt but seems to be a piece of cardboard covered with satin fabric.......for the price, will keep.",47175,3
47177,Cute but runs very small,47177,3
47178,They look good at first.,47178,3
47178,"Then I put them on and the top seam ripped out completely on the first one, and the second one!",47178,3
47178,"after a few washes, the color started to get spotty, (almost as if bleach were spilled on them) after a few weeks of wear, they started to loosen up and roll down my bicep.",47178,3
47178,I tossed these and went back to my Nike ones.,47178,3
47178,"If you are only going to use on occasion, these will work, BUT if you are going to use the 5+ days a week, buy the name brand GOOD ones!",47178,3
47179,"Nice skirt but somewhat small,But im going to still wear it ,cause its different",47179,3
47180,I really like spandex under my shorts so that my legs don't rub together.,47180,3
47180,"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs, these were too short in the back, and too tight on the waist and hips.",47180,3
47180,The pockets were cut too long for the shorts and hung out the whole time.,47180,3
47180,I would recommend ordering a size up!,47180,3
47181,I am 5 ft tall and 100 pounds and this fit me pretty well.,47181,3
47181,It's a little small in the shoulders but other than that this is a great shirt for the price,47181,3
47182,I bought a 2x cause I wear a size 14 very short and hard to get on gave to my daughter who wears a size 10 fit her perfect.,47182,3
47184,"Seem like very nice boxers, but the photo and description are misleading.",47184,3
47184,The buttons on the waist are for looks only.,47184,3
47184,It is a solid elastic waistband.,47184,3
47184,No need for buttons when they have no function.,47184,3
47184,Not the style I was looking for.,47184,3
47185,These break so easily..now I know why they put so many in the package.,47185,3
47185,I will not purchase them again.,47185,3
47185,I've gone through 4 of the six already.,47185,3
47186,These are great cargo pants.,47186,3
47186,"I love that they are a thick 100% cotton pant, as I cannot find 100% cotton pants anymore.",47186,3
47186,They all have some kind of elastic something or other in them.,47186,3
47186,They were too short though.,47186,3
47186,"I am 5' 9"" and I thought the size chart said they were 40.9"" long.",47186,3
47186,I don't know where they are measuring from but it is sure not the inseam.,47186,3
47186,I am sending them back.,47186,3
47186,"I think they are 32"" inseam for the size L.",47186,3
47188,Bottom is way too small!,47188,3
47188,The top is true to size.,47188,3
47188,I stretched and stretched the bottoms until I didn't hear anymore threads breaking...hey!,47188,3
47188,Bottoms are good now!,47188,3
47188,"For reference, I am 5'4, 120 lbs, 34C.",47188,3
47189,It was very nice but much too small.,47189,3
47189,I gave it to my daughter for her couples retreat and she loved it.,47189,3
47190,Love the stars and stripes!,47190,3
47190,It matches a purse I bought from another company and I was so excited to find this wallet.,47190,3
47190,The zipper works great.,47190,3
47190,"Holds my cash, credit cards, insurance cards, and business cards.",47190,3
47190,The reason I gave it only three stars is because the actual pockets to hold credit cards are not deep enough.,47190,3
47190,When I try to use the slots the cards stick out the top and it won't zip.,47190,3
47190,I have to put my cards into the pain pocket.,47190,3
47190,"But besides that I love the look, and feel of this wallet",47190,3
47191,This piece has an unnatural fit to the head but is very attractive...would be nice if the clip was smaller...worn many times..if you are not ok with moderate discomfort...then don't buy!,47191,3
47192,Worn them a couple of times before they fell apart.,47192,3
47193,"I think I should have ordered a medium or large, this product comes from China so it's a lot smaller than a US small.",47193,3
47193,"The black straps were also not as thick as the ones in the picture but for the price the quality was ok, if only I had gotten a bigger size.",47193,3
47193,I would actually consider ordering it again in a L probably which would be like a US medium bc I do like it.,47193,3
47195,"While the product seems well made, whoever did the sizing for it must have been either a sadist or someone from a 3rd world country where XX large means someone who uses the middle hole on their belt and can still see their feet.",47195,3
47195,"XXXX means ""SUMO WRESTLER - 3rd Year"", guys.",47195,3
47195,"Men, if you order these ... go up at least one size above your normal.",47195,3
47195,If you look like The Buddha or Andre the Giant ... chose another brand.,47195,3
47196,"Bottoms were great, top did not fit correctly",47196,3
47197,The front top part is much baggier than in the photo so it flops around awkwardly.,47197,3
47197,Not sure if it would fit better with larger breasts..,47197,3
47197,I kept it and just safety pinned it on the sides.,47197,3
47197,Haven't worn it out to test it yet though.,47197,3
47198,Cute but Was broken when it arrived.,47198,3
47198,Was able to fix it but not okay to have a broken bracelet before even wearing it.,47198,3
47200,"NOt much, but then, I didn't spend much.",47200,3
47200,Just a sloppy loungy tee.,47200,3
47201,Like this a lot.,47201,3
47201,Very comfortable and it looks great.,47201,3
47201,The opening is just a little too big and I'm not small boned.,47201,3
47201,"It's fine as long as you have a hair band on it, but if not, it would fall off my wrist.",47201,3
47201,My solution is to hold two thinner band on it instead of one thicker one in case I want to use the hair band.,47201,3
47202,It is a nice skirt but definitely do not order the size you are.,47202,3
47202,I went a size up and it was still too small,47202,3
47203,Good little bag but strap is cotton with leather sewn to one side.,47203,3
47203,The cotton looks cheap and attracts lint.,47203,3
47203,The item pictures are careful to not show you the cotton strap!!!,47203,3
47204,Would have been great if I lose 5 pounds!,47204,3
47205,"I am 5'2"" and 160 pounds with B cups and ordered size US 8-10 XL.",47205,3
47205,"I actually bought another swimsuit exactly like this one and loved it so much I thought I should get this one which was half the price... but this swimsuit fit differently, not as stretchy and form fitting.",47205,3
47205,I will be returning this swimsuit.,47205,3
47206,Nice bracelet but it comes a loose sometimes so you have to keep an eye on it.,47206,3
47208,Very pretty but too small.,47208,3
47209,Made for smaller Asian or Oriental men not made for chubby are heavy-set men... Not much room in the crotch area,47209,3
47211,Nice but super long.,47211,3
47212,The material is thin and stretchy.,47212,3
47212,"It is comfy, but there's not much support.",47212,3
47212,Depending on your shape they can ride up or down through the day.,47212,3
47212,Zero erection containment ability.,47212,3
47212,They've held up through several washings with no damage or fade.,47212,3
47212,"These are just thin underwear, not compression shorts.",47212,3
47213,It was too small in the chest area,47213,3
47214,"Fit was ok, quality not too bad...die job really bad..dark streaks in fabric !",47214,3
47215,"These are NOT leggings, they are footless tights.",47215,3
47216,Nice but there is is no give.,47216,3
47216,Not enough space for my DD girls.,47216,3
47217,I really like them because they are awesomely cute.,47217,3
47217,However they are not really made for someone who has curves.,47217,3
47217,I can usually wear anything that is like a one sites fits all but there are somewhat snug on me.,47217,3
47218,I just got all of the same one.,47218,3
47218,I was hoping for a variety :/,47218,3
47219,The material could be better.,47219,3
47219,Get a lot of compliments on it though,47219,3
47221,was not what i thought it would look it but good enough to keep for a second ring,47221,3
47222,I returned this because I didn't think the quality of the shirt was worth the price.,47222,3
47223,Cute top but I ended up returning it.,47223,3
47223,It was too short for my liking and a bit tight.,47223,3
47224,its beautiful not to much like the picture though but it will do.....,47224,3
47224,I also ordered ivory and got white which I'm not to happy about it but like I said it will .,47224,3
47225,Picture isn't what arrived.,47225,3
47226,It would probably be a good fit for someone wearing size 0-10.,47226,3
47227,The top is good but the bottoms are very small.,47227,3
47228,"Great shoes, but my son had wife feet..",47228,3
47228,So beware of wide feet with Vans!,47228,3
47229,I would be happier if they stayed in place longer.,47229,3
47229,I suppose if I pinched them to completely cut off circulation to my nipples they may stay put.,47229,3
47230,"Hat fits ok, but does not ""slouch"" the way the photo image shows.",47230,3
47230,I was hoping for the bagginess as shown on the mannequin.,47230,3
47231,"Love the shirt, a little small.",47231,3
47232,I bought a large and would normally buy medium.,47232,3
47232,Had to wear with leggings and boots with jacket because it didn't cover anything :/ still super cute though!,47232,3
47233,"Overall it works and fits as expected - low quality material making this purchase good for the low cost, but it won't be a suit I'll have for more than a few wears.",47233,3
47233,"Really only got this one to wear on a cruise for a hot tub night anyway, so it served it's purpose.",47233,3
47236,A very nice looking bracelet from afar but up close the steel looks very cheap and the weight makes it overall seem like it is made of plastic.,47236,3
47236,Overall I get what I paid for but I have no regrets for now.,47236,3
47236,I hope that the scripture doesn't scrape off easily.,47236,3
47238,I usually wear a medium but purchased a large for a baggy fit.,47238,3
47238,Looks just like picture.,47238,3
47238,This is definately a unique fashion statement.,47238,3
47238,"My only issue is when it arrived, there were no holes where the buttons go.",47238,3
47238,"I contacted the seller, who advised me to just cut the slits to make holes for the button.",47238,3
47238,No biggie easy fix.,47238,3
47238,-_- overall happy with this jacket.,47238,3
47238,But unlikely that i will purchase from this seller again.,47238,3
47239,"I think that the wallet should have had some sort of material on both sides to protect cards, other than that it's an ok wallet... it just takes some getting used to.",47239,3
47240,I expect that the dress be like the photo.,47240,3
47240,The long of the dress not to short .. 20 cm before the knee.,47240,3
47241,Nothing to do with cashmere.,47241,3
47241,Color was matching the picture.,47241,3
47242,"Too large, bulky and heavy.",47242,3
47244,The fabric wasn't too nice.,47244,3
47245,Gave to my sister.,47245,3
47247,Nice thin light jacket but way too small and much shorter than shown in the photos.,47247,3
47247,It came with a strong human odor like it was worn by someone before and unwashed.,47247,3
47247,I had to send it back.,47247,3
47248,"The shirt part of it is much, much too long.",47248,3
47249,I only had the bag a little more than a month and the other day the strap or the part that is hooked onto the bag (part of the strap)just broke.,47249,3
47249,It looked as if something had cut across it.,47249,3
47249,"I only carry it to and from work and I had not bogged it down with heavy stuff, so I just can not imagine how or why it broke.",47249,3
47249,I am brokenhearted too.,47249,3
47249,I really like the bag but now I have to carry it  by the handle.,47249,3
47249,"It's no big deal, I just really liked the strap.",47249,3
47250,"Great material and quality
But was small
Will return for a bigger size",47250,3
47251,I like it but it broke within a couple of weeks,47251,3
47253,"I like it, but it already cracked on the side.",47253,3
47253,I guess it goes to show you get what you pay for.,47253,3
47254,I had to end up using it as a bathing suit cover up because I couldn't wear it as a dress.,47254,3
47255,Color as pictures but looks cheap.,47255,3
47256,I wear a size 4 normally and these are much too large for me.,47256,3
47256,I am 26 weeks and these fall down every few steps.,47256,3
47256,"Also, they are not seamless as the name says.",47256,3
47256,Not a big deal but thought I would mention there is a seam inside the legs.,47256,3
47257,"It is large enough to hold lots of stuff, but the zipper is already sticking and I've only been using it for a few months.",47257,3
47258,The look of the tutu is so cute!,47258,3
47258,"However, the fit is a little off.",47258,3
47258,It's super poofy and somewhat sheer in places where the tulle isn't gathered together.,47258,3
47258,Worked great for my daughters birthday though!,47258,3
47259,"They fit fine, just a bit tight and a little sheer.",47259,3
47259,But I'm ok with that.,47259,3
47259,I'm happy I bought these but when I bought them they cost more than they do now.,47259,3
47259,I think they should cost less than 13 bucks.,47259,3
47259,I got XXL but I'm a large in most leggings and I can fit in one size fits all.,47259,3
47259,I'm 5'2 weighing at 179.,47259,3
47259,But I'm muscular so maybe that's why they fit me.,47259,3
47259,"If you have unfit legs, they'll be hard to put on and may rip.",47259,3
47259,I noticed mine had loose strings by my ankle.,47259,3
47259,"They did fit good on my waist but like I said if you're not in shape, it may be different for you.",47259,3
47259,Just think about your body frame and remember these run small.,47259,3
47260,"Although it seems well made and sturdy, it's much to large for my small wrists.",47260,3
47260,Other than that it's a good looking nautical accessory for us beach lovers.,47260,3
47261,I really like the little charm.,47261,3
47261,"But, I didn't realize when I purchased them that they were plastic and I prefer semi precious stones.",47261,3
47261,I really don't like the plastc very much.,47261,3
47261,They are functional and nice looking though.,47261,3
47262,hurts my ears a little but it looks cool.,47262,3
47262,I get a lot of compliments,47262,3
47263,It was well done and the t-shirt was good quality but it was not a maternity shirt.,47263,3
47263,It was a normal fitted t-shirt--not intended to fit a pregnant belly.,47263,3
47264,"It's a beautiful dress, but it ran smaller than I thought it would.",47264,3
47265,Shirt is cute but it has a very noticeably large stain on the back.,47265,3
47266,I like it but it's different from the previous one I ordered.,47266,3
47266,I really like the tan one so I ordered two more colors and they're different.,47266,3
47266,I took off two stars because they're a different material and smaller.,47266,3
47267,It looks better from the back then the front.,47267,3
47267,Seems like it's too much material in the front.,47267,3
47267,The skirt underneath is super short.,47267,3
47267,I like short skirts so it was ok with me.,47267,3
47267,Haven't worn it out.,47267,3
47267,Only tried it on.,47267,3
47268,I love the shirt but its a bit tight,47268,3
47269,I ordered a 6 (my ring finger) and it fits my pinky.,47269,3
47269,"Other than that, I actually really like the ring.",47269,3
47269,Will see how it wears and update then.,47269,3
47270,"Nice bracelet, sturdy and good color",47270,3
47271,loved the color... but it was kinda big...,47271,3
47272,just too much dress for me but very well made,47272,3
47273,"VERY cute shirt but I believe it's fake, it's supposed to have a simply southern shirt tag.",47273,3
47274,I bought a 6x  it might fit a 3x person,47274,3
47275,The necklace is shorter than it looks and it looks like and antique metal.,47275,3
47276,They do run large.,47276,3
47276,"Not very comfortable, in my opinion but if you wear them with thick socks they work out.",47276,3
47276,I can't imagine these lasting a really long time but well worth the cost.,47276,3
47277,ran a little small in chest,47277,3
47278,"quality fine, runs extremely small.",47278,3
47278,unfortunately I will have to return it,47278,3
47279,But runs small(order 2x up) and VERY short in front.,47279,3
47279,"Unless you are maybe 5'-0"" .",47279,3
47280,Having problems with the top zipper catching on the inside fabric.,47280,3
47280,It is bigger than the dimensions that were stated.,47280,3
47280,My wife has said it will serve its purpose and will probably buy from Zbeibei again.,47280,3
47281,The ring with writing is sloppy.,47281,3
47281,not very well made.,47281,3
47281,"with this product, you certainly get what you pay for.",47281,3
47282,Took awhile to get here.,47282,3
47282,"But its exactly as the picture shows, order a bit bigger than what you are, mines a tad smaller than what i would like.",47282,3
47283,"The product seems well made, but the sizes are no where near accurate.",47283,3
47283,The garment was way too small.,47283,3
47283,"Also, these products take a very long time to ship.",47283,3
47283,The owner is kind and is willing to do a return.,47283,3
47283,Very prompt replies to my emails.,47283,3
47283,Just order larger than you think.,47283,3
47285,"Ordered a medium, top was too big, bottom too small.",47285,3
47286,"The top was kind of tight , and both of the set were sort of see through but if white undergarments were worn you would be fine.",47286,3
47286,Also came sooner than expected (three weeks early almost) .,47286,3
47286,I usually wear a small in shirts and extra small / ones in shorts so I'm pretty impressed overall.,47286,3
47287,This shirt came slightly soiled apparently from the automatic folding machines.,47287,3
47287,Paul Frederick customer service was easy to deal with.,47287,3
47287,"However, the shirt ran a bit small.",47287,3
47287,"The supposed 35"" sleeves were barely long enough, and my husband has consistently worn a 16-1/2 x 35 shirt size for years.",47287,3
47287,Be aware that there is no wrinkle-guard protection in this all-cotton shirt.,47287,3
47287,"I didn't notice that when ordering, and it was a challenge to iron the ""rumpled look"" out.",47287,3
47289,"The Dress Is Beautiful, Nice Material And Stretchy.",47289,3
47289,"But It Fits Small And Too Short For A Dress, You Can Wear It As A Top Because It's Way Too Short For A Dress, I Bought Size X-Large And It Fits Better For A Medium Size",47289,3
47290,It looks like the picture but isn't a really good quality.,47290,3
47291,Did not like material.,47291,3
47291,"Wires were fine, but it is stretchable material.",47291,3
47291,It is very itchy.,47291,3
47292,"fine product, just too small.",47292,3
47293,Was not pleased with this order.,47293,3
47293,"I bought them for my daughter for her cartilage piercings, but they do not work for that.",47293,3
47293,"All of the earrings face the same way, so they can only be worn not the left ear.",47293,3
47293,"In the right ear, the hearts are upside down.",47293,3
47293,The earrings themselves seem to be made of fine material.,47293,3
47294,"way to short and I order a large, still wear as a night shirt.",47294,3
47295,I thought it was going to be a bit bigger.,47295,3
47295,It looks different in pics.,47295,3
47295,"But, I like it.",47295,3
47296,Tight in the bust area...may want to buy a size up.,47296,3
47297,This is a really beautiful dress of decent quality and for that reason I give it a three star.,47297,3
47297,Downside...I ordered an XL and it looks and fits like a med.,47297,3
47298,Sweet turtle necklace and chain.,47298,3
47300,"I like the top, but the neck lays funny.",47300,3
47301,looks like the pic but is poor quality.,47301,3
47301,but for the price it's ok,47301,3
47302,They ride up on the legs.,47302,3
47303,The item is nice but quality is not.,47303,3
47303,A little flimsy for me taste.,47303,3
47304,The fabric is incredibly thin.,47304,3
47304,But overall a nice fit and the picture is accurate in color and form.,47304,3
47305,The tie itself looks lovely and slimming!,47305,3
47305,"Tied in my favorite eldridge knot, it's stunning and I got many compliments from my other servers.",47305,3
47305,The down side and subtraction of TWO stars is the false advertising.,47305,3
47305,"One star for not being stain resistant (It's not horrible, but not the server's tie I thought I'd found), and one for the blasphemous name of the product that exclaims ""ONE WEEK SALE!!""",47305,3
47305,"Over a month later, it's just a clickbait title to get me to buy the product and it worked.",47305,3
47305,Not a fan of the marketing team.,47305,3
47306,"Girlfriend loved it, IMO more pixelated then imaged.",47306,3
47308,They are nice but a little tight.,47308,3
47308,Not as thick as the Gaiam is a great brand if you are looking for thick leggings with a cute outfit!,47308,3
47309,It's cute but it's small in the bottom area.,47309,3
47309,I have thick thighs so it's more fitted then I liked.,47309,3
47310,The panties were too small while the top fit perfect.,47310,3
47311,"Looks great, the crown of the hat is just a little too big for my head.",47311,3
47312,"Fits well, get compliments.",47312,3
47312,But after a few washes the fabric is piling.,47312,3
47313,The neck was a bit small and the cut on the shoulder to narrow to wear a bra.,47313,3
47314,"Product came quickly, however didn't look like the picture.",47314,3
47314,Looks very cheaply made in person.,47314,3
47314,But that makes sense being as inexpensive as it is.,47314,3
47315,The product arrived quickly.,47315,3
47315,The velcro is strong.,47315,3
47315,The fit is good.,47315,3
47315,Criticism:  The band looks like it was cut and stitched by a three year old.,47315,3
47315,It is irregular in width and the sewing was done without care.,47315,3
47315,Perhaps I received an irregular sample that escaped quality control inspection?,47315,3
47315,Perhaps it met the makers standard of quality?,47315,3
47316,Didn't do a think for arthritis - but it is pretty.,47316,3
47317,the design is really cute!,47317,3
47317,"but very disappointed the button fell right away,and it a little bit short!",47317,3
47319,I bought these for Halloween.,47319,3
47319,"They are surprisingly comfortable, easy to walk and dance in.",47319,3
47319,I gave them 3 stars because material is pulling apart at the front seams on both boots after just 1 night.,47319,3
47320,Order this a size bigger and you'll be fine.,47320,3
47321,The dress looks and fits okay but the material is very thin.,47321,3
47322,"Not really what I expected, hard to get cards in and out.",47322,3
47322,But super fast delivery.,47322,3
47323,I wrote a review but feel like I was just a bit too harsh.,47323,3
47323,"These would work best with a Halloween costume, not for everyday use with cute outfits.",47323,3
47323,"Because, they do look costume-y.",47323,3
47323,But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal.,47323,3
47323,"Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection.",47323,3
47323,"I would recommend these, just because of the low price.",47323,3
47323,It can't hurt to buy them.,47323,3
47323,They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally.,47323,3
47323,However they did fit me nicely and I wear a size 8 1/2.,47323,3
47323,I feel like they would fit a few sizes larger than me as well.,47323,3
47324,I would not recommend this if you are short I got and tried it one and I thought it was super cute but it made me look wide and like I have absolutely no stomach,47324,3
47325,"(Daughter is 5'2"", 100 pounds and ordered a size S).",47325,3
47325,"The top is a bit big and arrived with a significant crease in one of the cups, that we could not smooth out by manipulating.",47325,3
47325,Maybe this will smooth out once wet.,47325,3
47325,"We found a similar top at Target in size XS and bought that to go with the bottoms of this suit, and she is now SET!",47325,3
47326,"Good shirt, bad material",47326,3
47327,"The style of the bracelet is really nice, but the bracelet itself wears really odd.",47327,3
47328,Highly recommend ordering a size larger than what you usually wear.,47328,3
47328,After the first day of wearing it little holes started appearing.,47328,3
47328,Made me sad because it's pretty cute.,47328,3
47329,"I am 5'7""-165 lbs- 32 waist- usually a size M- Ordered Large- should have gone XL.",47329,3
47331,The yellow print was not as bright as I had expected.,47331,3
47331,"In the photo, the yellow shows up very bright against the black shirt, but on mine it looks almost faded out and is difficult to read.",47331,3
47331,I think it would have worked out better if I had ordered a light-colored shirt and chosen a darker ink.,47331,3
47332,This was a beautiful swim suit but the top was way too small (I'm a 34 dd).,47332,3
47332,"I hated to have to return this, but this is not for anyone who has breasts larger than a b cup.",47332,3
47333,"This beanie is a little smaller than I thought it would be, so it doesn't really have enough extra fabric to ""slouch"", if you will.",47333,3
47333,"It's still wearable though, just not able to be styled as pictured.",47333,3
47333,Unless you have a tiny head.,47333,3
47334,It works very well but I've only had it for a short time and it's already tearing.,47334,3
47334,Other than that it works well.,47334,3
47334,I guess that's why it's so cheap.,47334,3
47335,I normally wear a medium so I got a large thinking it would be perfect for exercising.,47335,3
47335,It fits like it's a small.,47335,3
47336,My daughter loves the coat.,47336,3
47336,Great quality only problem is it runs small.,47336,3
47336,It doesnt fit her and site States now there are none available so i don't think an exchange is possible.,47336,3
47337,Fit as expected but the material is not what I expected.,47337,3
47337,The shirt is so see through I probably never can wear it especially because its off the shoulders so I can't wear a tank underneath it.,47337,3
47338,fit to snug for a one size fits all and I'm about an 10 in size,47338,3
47339,Love the dress order my dress size but it really is big,47339,3
47340,This dress would have be amazing but it is a little too thin for me to wear.,47340,3
47340,"You could see through the top a bit, and that made me uncomfortable.",47340,3
47340,"besides that, I loved it.",47340,3
47341,"Ran small, not true to color.",47341,3
47341,It was a gift.,47341,3
47341,But they never knew the color was off.,47341,3
47341,It was a good neutral color though.,47341,3
47342,Too large my son wears 8 or 8 1/2 size Nikes so I purchased an 8 in these water shoes and no way will he be able to walk in them way too large.,47342,3
47342,"So I may order a smaller size, over all great quality for the price.",47342,3
47342,Only a 3 star because the other thing I don't like about the shoe is that the opening on top is quite large too open where my son's foot slips out yet again it can be because the sizing is so off.,47342,3
47343,"Well made, but fit way too big.",47343,3
47343,This would be a good buy if you have a very large hat size.,47343,3
47344,"These are super cute, but were a little big for my 11.5 month old (he has big puffy feet so I thought they would fit even though he wasn't of the age designated).",47344,3
47344,"We will have to wait a month or so for him to be able to wear them because when he walks in them, they twist, turn and bunch.",47344,3
47345,The fabric is pretty rigid.,47345,3
47345,"You need to keep the collar from getting deformed, otherwise it will look stupid.",47345,3
47345,"The shirt overall looks super cute, it could be a little longer and the shoulders a tad smaller.",47345,3
47345,"Perhaps my torso is too long for the size... but then, a size bigger would be too baggy.",47345,3
47345,"I use it under sweaters, to add a little bit of something to a boring studio day.",47345,3
47346,I love the top of this swimsuit (the padding looked weird but they're removable so that's not a problem) but the bottoms don't fit right at all.,47346,3
47346,The lower strap is too tight and the top strap is way too loose.,47346,3
47347,It's not that great.,47347,3
47348,I wear a size 6 so ordered a large.,47348,3
47348,Very thin material so needs to be much looser to look right.,47348,3
47348,Overall I liked the style.,47348,3
47348,Too bad it did not fit.,47348,3
47349,"I love the pattern of this kimono, however, I'm not the biggest fan of the fit.",47349,3
47349,"It looks cute with certain things, but with others, it makes me look heavier than I am.",47349,3
47349,"I am 5'5"" and 140lbs, so I'm not heavy by any means, but this kimono has the tendency to create the appearance of a little extra weight.",47349,3
47350,they are some what small,47350,3
47351,It is not SLIM.,47351,3
47351,"With 5 cards and 10 bills, it bulks up.",47351,3
47351,Compact would be more appropriate.,47351,3
47351,The bill compartment and the one hidden card compartment is good.,47351,3
47351,My issue is  with the main card compartments.,47351,3
47351,They are very loose and my cards tend to slip out.,47351,3
47352,"I received the wrong print, but it was actually prettier than the other.",47352,3
47353,Too small opening for my sunglasses.,47353,3
47353,"Don't know what kind most are using this for, but mine are too large.",47353,3
47354,"Its very different from the picture, not as many ruffles and it's less hi-lo, more lo-mid-lo, the material is the cheapest felt/ wool blend you could find, but still cute for the price.",47354,3
47355,After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical about even purchasing it to begin with.,47355,3
47355,"Being graced with ""junk in the trunk"",  I was hesitant that this was even a possibility,  but bought an extra large just to be safe.",47355,3
47355,"Although I still bought it because of how adorable it was, the bottoms (XL) did not fit as expected.",47355,3
47355,I even put it  against a medium purchased at a different store and it was identical.,47355,3
47355,I am very happy with the top but wish the bottoms were true to size.,47355,3
47355,As a result I had to purchase bottoms at a different store locally.,47355,3
47355,"I would recommend being very cautious to get your buyers,  and if you are curvy (like myself), we warned you are simply buying the top for the price listed.",47355,3
47356,They look nice but are not the best quality,47356,3
47357,"Fit great, but the material didn't wash well.",47357,3
47357,Even on the gentle cycle the material disintegrated.,47357,3
47358,"The material is not as thick as I had thought it would be, but overall very comfortable.",47358,3
47358,I had to order 2 sizes bigger than what would normally fit me.,47358,3
47358,"I had ordered this before at the size it should have been, and it was way too small.",47358,3
47358,Ordering a much larger size fit perfectly.,47358,3
47358,I would have even gone another size up.,47358,3
47359,"I really hate this shirt was to small, and o ordered a 3xl where normally I only wear a xl.",47359,3
47359,"The shirt has great colors, it has a teal color that goes with my teal leggings a mint color that goes with my mint CAMI and red to go with my red leggings...",47359,3
47359,So u can see why I'm so disappointed!,47359,3
47359,I'll have to end up giving it to my daughter.,47359,3
47360,Beautiful necklace and good value for the money.,47360,3
47360,The picture is in  very good resolution and the backing frame is sturdy and attractive.,47360,3
47360,"The only fault is the chain, which is a little flimsy, and the pendent came off several times in the course of wearing it.",47360,3
47360,"If the chain was replaced, it would make a good gift for lovers of astronomy or science.",47360,3
47361,"Poor quality, took too long to arrive",47361,3
47362,Plan on keeping for when I get down.,47362,3
47363,Some of the pouches are bigger than others.,47363,3
47364,It was more like a  teens small not an adult medium.,47364,3
47364,I take a size 2.,47364,3
47365,My 5 and 6 year olds wore them,47365,3
47366,Like the dress very nice but some theatre was hanging off .the material is good but also have some problem with the sales other dresses but this one is o.k.,47366,3
47367,First shirt worn developed a hole in the arm within a few hours.,47367,3
47368,Pretty I liked it but broke very easy,47368,3
47369,fit strange but it works for its purpose.,47369,3
47370,"there is an odd yellowish smear on the C,",47370,3
47371,Only complaint are the arm holes are too big.,47371,3
47372,It sheds a little and is a little bigger than expected.,47372,3
47372,Very comfy and soft.,47372,3
47373,"I love shirt so much it's so soft and comfortable and stylish, it's such a summary shirt but only it's for winter.",47373,3
47373,"Only I wish it came in a bigger size like I ordered, but besides that it was amazing.",47373,3
47373,It came in so early then what Amazon expected it to be and I was so happy only I ordered a shirt from the same company that was so small that it was smartest one in so itchy arms red and irritated.,47373,3
47373,"So if you see the blue shirt with sequins I recommend not getting it, because if you do you'll regret",47373,3
47374,"These came in and were too long and loose on me, not one size fits all, I am 5'3"" and wear size 8 normally, so I don't consider myself small.",47374,3
47374,"But the material is nice, but definitely shear more like tights.",47374,3
47375,I do not like the clasp at the end of the zipper pockets.,47375,3
47375,It sticks out way too much not giving me a smooth seam on the sides.,47375,3
47376,I do not like the new fabric  they are made  with.,47376,3
47376,The ones that I have had for sometime were the ribbed ones and these seem like they are made out of some material that is synthetic.,47376,3
47376,The ribbed ones were cotton with some stretch in them.,47376,3
47377,The mask didn't arrive with the package...Does someone have the same problem?,47377,3
47378,Doesn't look like the picture a little cheap looking,47378,3
47379,It's not as pretty in real life.,47379,3
47379,The pictures are much better.,47379,3
47379,It's ok for a pre-teen or child.,47379,3
47379,Not really a grown-up jewelry.,47379,3
47380,I don't like the seam running down the middle.,47380,3
47380,"It is very bad placement, and to be honest sometimes gives the illusion of a camel toe...",47380,3
47381,It was as expected.,47381,3
47381,Not disappointed with the look but the necklace left lots of black stains on my neck and clothing when I wear it.,47381,3
47382,It's OK. To me the fabric or 'look' is just not as nice as I would like.- My guy doesn't like it at all.,47382,3
47383,I am a size M/L usually- I bought a large so it would be more loose.,47383,3
47383,It fits snug and was more of a boat neck than a true off the shoulder but is still cute,47383,3
47384,My son normally wears size 1-2 in athletic shoes so we ordered these in size 2.,47384,3
47384,Unfortunately my son couldn't even get them on his feet.,47384,3
47384,Size 2 was actually smaller than last year's size 1 cleats!,47384,3
47385,"NIce appearance and material, but size is smaller than you would expect.",47385,3
47385,Will keep them and give them to someone who would normally order one size smaller.,47385,3
47385,Order up in size if you want them to fit you.,47385,3
47386,I was disappointed these were so thin and tight.,47386,3
47386,I like a baggier style and thought these would be perfect.,47386,3
47387,Cute boots but not for long term wear.,47387,3
47388,XXXl fits like a medumn and washed once it unrevaled Great printing,47388,3
47389,Fit right looks like the pic,47389,3
47390,my phone didn't fit,47390,3
47391,"Look n feel great, they just run on the small size.",47391,3
47391,Order them at least one size bigger.,47391,3
47392,"I like this blouse, but the fabric is so thin it requires a camisole or a svelt, young body underneath.",47392,3
47393,Okay but zippers and snaps are poorer quality and not nearly as attractive as the 10 year old red one I have had in the same style.,47393,3
47393,Would have preferred one exacly like it.,47393,3
47393,This is the only style wallet I like after using the red one.,47393,3
47393,"Price was good, possibly a little too much because of zippers and snap.",47393,3
47394,"I want to give 4 stars because it isn't your typical cheap jewelry but I can not get pass it taken 7 weeks to receive, so only 3 stars.",47394,3
47395,"Nice, but the tag is on the outside of the shirt completely in a random spot.",47395,3
47395,Also the pads are very hard not comfy at all,47395,3
47397,I like the skirt I ordered a purple one.,47397,3
47397,It wasn't the purple I was expecting mine was more of an maroon but I'm okay with that.,47397,3
47397,I love the pockets that's the main reason why I ordered it and I love it.,47397,3
47398,Appear to be little girl knee highs,47398,3
47399,"Looks good, not great quality",47399,3
47400,I bought a XL and fit like a Large so buy one size larger.,47400,3
47401,The color of the dress was not the same in the picture.,47401,3
47401,The material was as expected.,47401,3
47401,"When I tried on the dress, it was wider at the bottom and did not cling like the rest of the dress.",47401,3
47402,Not what the picture describes but it is good for keeping you warm.,47402,3
47403,Looks better in the picture.,47403,3
47403,I love that it is not low cut and has a small sleeve.,47403,3
47403,Oh but the print!,47403,3
47403,"It is so loud, a walking billboard of roses.",47403,3
47403,The material is nice and soft.,47403,3
47403,"This is truly an attention getter, but for the wrong reasons.",47403,3
47403,I'm using it as a nightgown.,47403,3
47405,Wallet arrived in a timely manner but the build quality was lacking.,47405,3
47405,Works for the price I paid though.,47405,3
47405,I wouldn't buy this wallet again.,47405,3
47406,So excited to get this bag but in the photo it looked more silver.,47406,3
47406,"When it arrived it was tan/taupe (as described) and the accents were gold, not silver as was reflected in the picture.",47406,3
47406,Still a huge bag and Big Buddha Bags are great.,47406,3
47406,Just wish that it had been the color I had thought.,47406,3
47407,Way to small after sizing up,47407,3
47410,It is cute but to big for my taste,47410,3
47411,Not quite what I expected,47411,3
47412,"When they arrived, one pair was stained.",47412,3
47413,I purchased this to use earlier on in my pregnancy with the hopes of extending the use of my non-maternity pants.,47413,3
47413,So far I have used it maybe twice.,47413,3
47413,It proved pretty useless.,47413,3
47414,I love the fabric and it looks cute on but I pulled on the sleeve just a little and the whole ruffle ripped off.,47414,3
47414,I am a 0 to 2 usually and ordered the medium.,47414,3
47414,It's just a little snug but not bad.,47414,3
47414,I gave it 3 stars because it is really cute just wished the stitching had been reinforced more.,47414,3
47415,top is smaller thank expected and bottoms are a little tight.,47415,3
47415,I'm 5'4 and 125 lbs,47415,3
47416,I am not sure how other girls were able to fit their C cups into this... because I sure can't!,47416,3
47417,The fit is absolutely amazing and it came a lot earlier than expected.,47417,3
47417,One big problem that I did have is that the product seemed to be mildewed in several spots.,47417,3
47417,"There were spots in the front of the shirt, the back, and the sides.",47417,3
47417,Luckily I know a few cleaning techniques that will hopefully get rid of the spots.,47417,3
47418,Soo cute looks great on and size was as expected.,47418,3
47418,The only reason I'm giving a 3 star rating is the color is way off.,47418,3
47418,It is definitely more orange than the picture,47418,3
47419,It comes from China - nothing special it works and the price was right.,47419,3
47420,I loved it but was to small so I returned it and order another one in a larger size.,47420,3
47420,Received larger size and fit perfectly.,47420,3
47421,the only drawback is that these were made in China.,47421,3
47421,Others being sold are made in USA,47421,3
47422,"Cute, has felt to protect their delicate skin from the glue rubbing.",47422,3
47422,I wish they were a little stretchier im still searching for good headbands for my 7 month old who has a big head.,47422,3
47423,Not the quality that we thought.,47423,3
47423,Took longer to arrive than we expected.,47423,3
47424,"It is a bit smaller than described, I would suggest going on size up.",47424,3
47424,The front is much shorter than the back too.,47424,3
47424,The front barely reaches the top of my pants while the back goes past my butt.,47424,3
47425,It fit as the measurements specified.,47425,3
47425,I didn't like that it had a mesh center underneath the skirting.,47425,3
47425,Seemed that it was made cheap and quality wasn't the best.,47425,3
47426,smaller than expected would love to wear as a swimsuit but too small so underwear it is.,47426,3
47427,Way too small but of good quality.,47427,3
47427,Sizing should be adjusted.,47427,3
47428,"Really cute, lined in cute silk like lining with cute little nail polishes and cosmetics on the inside but runs too small.",47428,3
47428,I ordered 2x fits like a large maybe even a medium,47428,3
47429,Ordered a smaller size.,47429,3
47429,Waiting for new dress to ensure it will fit.,47429,3
47429,The chart was not accurate in selecting size,47429,3
47430,Product runs really really smart,47430,3
47431,Nice dress  but 3rd try!,47431,3
47431,Wear 6/8P too small.,47431,3
47431,Rendered 10 too small.,47431,3
47431,"1 more time ordered 12, hope that  works.",47431,3
47431,"Thanks to easy free returns, hope 3rd times a charm.",47431,3
47431,Still a lot of wasted time and disapointment.,47431,3
47431,The dress is beautiful,47431,3
47432,"Actually a very attractive design, but the XXL designation was way off the mark.",47432,3
47432,Will be giving it away to someone else.,47432,3
47432,It certainly doesn't fit me.,47432,3
47433,A kind of scratchy material very cute but if u r busty order large,47433,3
47434,The shirt itself had no flaws and would defiantly be worn if it was not too small.,47434,3
47434,I felt it ran small so I would buy the next size you from your normal size,47434,3
47435,The suit is lovely but I ordered later than I normally do and it was just to tight,47435,3
47436,I wish it was not on a set chain.,47436,3
47436,"A pendant would be great, so that it can be short or long.",47436,3
47436,I'm a small person so it hits just under a round neck line ....would love to have made shorter or longer.,47436,3
47437,Color is COMPLETELY off on the purple dress.,47437,3
47437,"It looks like a deep amethyst purple in the picture, but when you get it it is like a...light grey-ish purple.",47437,3
47437,Not as deep or stunning as the picture.,47437,3
47437,Nice bouncy material with nice tailoring.,47437,3
47437,"The bust line is very flattering on me (36D), a la Marilyn's white halter dress-similar effect on the ol' girls",47437,3
47438,It was smaller than I expected; it only fit on my pinky.,47438,3
47439,"It's comfortable, I'll give it that, but as a girl who is 5'7"", it doesn't quite reach past my ankles.",47439,3
47439,I had to let the seams out in the legs and it still isn't long enough.,47439,3
47439,"So if you're tall, keep in mind that it might end up being too short for you!",47439,3
47440,bigger than I thought,47440,3
47441,clean looking diamonds - not yellow and good sparkle.,47441,3
47441,"but the wife says the screw-ins hurt a lot, so unfortunately these are going to be returned.",47441,3
47442,"When I bought these, it stated that they were cotton.",47442,3
47442,But they are cute and fit well- I'm still looking for some that have some cotton but these aren't it.,47442,3
47443,This version of Powerstep is great for the arch but the heel portion is not cupped enough and a firmer orthodic bed is what I should have purchased.,47443,3
47443,Every foot is different.,47443,3
47444,I received the frame unbalanced,47444,3
47445,Not sterling silver... more like silver plated.,47445,3
47445,Just a heads up.,47445,3
47446,Such a clever idea for those clothes that need to strapless bra .,47446,3
47446,"I suppose the fit was as expected, but I couldn't get the top to look right .",47446,3
47446,You could always see the ridge under my clothes where the bra stopped.,47446,3
47446,I am a 30 8B and the capsizing to be correct .,47446,3
47446,"Also, it was sticky enough to where I didn't feel like it was going to fall down .",47446,3
47446,I guess I just need to keep working with it to try and get it to look right under my clothes.,47446,3
47447,It fits a size to small doesn't scoop on the neck like the picture shows and isn't as long but still cute.,47447,3
47448,I had ordered a medium and received an extra large.,47448,3
47448,"Therefore, I was not able to use this swim suit and had to return it.",47448,3
47448,I ended up going with a couple other ones I had been trying out.,47448,3
47448,I do have to say that the material seemed good quality.,47448,3
47448,"However, the crochet material was not stretchy.",47448,3
47448,"Therefore, getting the right size is very important with this one.",47448,3
47448,It was a total bummer since the design was fun and original!,47448,3
47448,"PS: For anyone that is totally in love with it, I recommend ordering it in a couple different sizes just to make sure you are getting the right fit.",47448,3
47448,You can always return the one that does not fit.,47448,3
47448,Amazon makes the return process super easy and convenient!,47448,3
47448,I have been very impressed with their customer service!,47448,3
47449,Fabric was a little thinner than expected.,47449,3
47450,I like it but wish there were black patent handles to match.,47450,3
47451,Pros: Beautiful color and it fits my Note 5.,47451,3
47451,Cons: The way it is sewn together does not allow it to completely open up so you are left with a fairly small opening to the wallet.,47451,3
47451,Still happy with it - the price is certainly right.,47451,3
47451,Would honestly recommend as long as the buyer was aware of the small opening.,47451,3
47452,It is a little low cut and the length is just a tad short but other than that it is comfortable,47452,3
47453,perfectly flat glass in these frames.,47453,3
47453,No convexity at all.,47453,3
47453,They are definitely RETRO.,47453,3
47454,"Nice printing but the tshirt itself is on my he small size, I'd order a size up.",47454,3
47455,The belt quality is very nice and as expected.,47455,3
47455,The length of the belt is too long.,47455,3
47455,Screwed it up trying to cut it to 34 inch waist.,47455,3
47455,But they should offer proper lengths.,47455,3
47455,However I knew the belt was 48 inches.,47455,3
47455,It was on the web page.,47455,3
47456,My daughter was thrilled with this outfit and so excited to wear it!,47456,3
47456,She has worn it once and not even for a full day.,47456,3
47456,The top fit great but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the leggings.,47456,3
47456,"They were loose, the knees became worn after only one use and the pants faded already after I washed them.",47456,3
47456,For the price I expected better quality.,47456,3
47456,I can buy leggings for a lot less that are better made.,47456,3
47457,Basic skirt but very small.,47457,3
47458,I thought it would be a little bigger but everything else was good,47458,3
47459,This is a really cute dress but fits too small like 2 sizes smaller good thing I have another daughter younger and smaller and I can pass it to her,47459,3
47460,"The coat is sized as I expected from reading the description, extra large is a true extra large with room for a jacket liner and still fit comfortably over another layer.",47460,3
47460,It is well made but has some flaws when I compare to others I've owned over the years.,47460,3
47460,This is the fifth M-65 field coat I've owned over my lifetime counting the original that was issued to me.,47460,3
47460,"On this one, in extra large size, the zipper is 2"" shorter than on a large size M-65 that I also own which means the start of the zipper is well above my waist when I put it on.",47460,3
47460,"The inside adjustable string for the waist is also at least 2"" higher than it should be so as I snug it up it is snugging up more around my chest more than around my waist.",47460,3
47460,"The velcro tabs on the sleeves are about 1/2"" short and just barely functional.",47460,3
47461,This swimsuit is beautiful and fits great.,47461,3
47461,The only complaint is the band on the bottom of the tank is very stiff.,47461,3
47461,I couldn't get it over my head without hearing ripping in the lining.,47461,3
47461,"Once I got it on, I ended up pulling the lining to losen it up a little.",47461,3
47461,The bottom of the tank needs to be reinforced with an elastic band.,47461,3
47462,Nice quality and color was true to photo.,47462,3
47462,Just wish that it was actually a tunic and not a long shirt.,47462,3
47462,I have purchased from this company before and this 'tunic' is the same as the shirts they offer.,47462,3
47464,"Looks great on my girlfriend but is rather thin and flimsy so quite okay for Southern California occasional rains, but doubtful long lasting in heavier rain climates.",47464,3
47466,"i like it, just need to lose couple inches before i can fit into it.",47466,3
47466,i got it my size.,47466,3
47467,"The string that tightens the hat has a hart plastic part which stays right behind the head of the baby and if the baby is sitting in seat with a headrest (stroller, carseat etc) it makes the hat very uncomfortable.",47467,3
47468,Good for a costume,47468,3
47469,"Gorgeous blazer, just wished I'd ordered a size up but seller didn't have a problem with giving me a refund.",47469,3
47469,"Other than that, it would have gotten a 5 star.",47469,3
47470,I really like the colors but not a fan of the fit.,47470,3
47470,It is way too tight for a large.,47470,3
47470,"AI ordered up according to a few reviews, didn't really help.",47470,3
47470,As soon as I put this on the seams on the bottoms ripped a bit.,47470,3
47470,If I do order another suit I'll for sure order two sizes up.,47470,3
47471,Built in bra is not an accurate description  It is a shelf bra not really a bra at all,47471,3
47472,The materials were not that great.,47472,3
47472,It fits well except the blue is not tacked down so it will change position a bit.,47472,3
47472,Other wise good for light swimming or hot tub.,47472,3
47473,Unfortunately I have to return because the color burgundy that arrived does not match the color burgundy as in picture,47473,3
47474,Want  to exchange for  a 5xtra l,47474,3
47476,I wear a size 14w.,47476,3
47476,I ordered dress in XL(12-14) I love the way dress fit BUT this dress is VERY thin and see through.,47476,3
47476,I was expecting this dress to be in T-shirt material but instead it's a thin spandex material.,47476,3
47477,One of the backs broke on the first day but the flowers are very cute so I just found a different back to use on them.,47477,3
47478,The top was fine.,47478,3
47478,"The bottoms were very odd...they were very large compared to the tops, and had no butt coverage.",47478,3
47479,Well i have tried lots of underwear i am a mailman and i like to be comfartable.,47479,3
47479,So needless to say i gave these a try and i found pros and cons the pro is awesome designs and very comfartable!,47479,3
47479,Now for the con which is a major one for me when im walking around they  ride up bad!,47479,3
47479,I was crushed......... so in my opinion for same price ill buy tommy john.,47479,3
47480,"Cute dress, but very small.",47480,3
47480,I usually wear a US XS/S and I have to wear this dress like a tunic.,47480,3
47481,per the picture the shoes are a navy color but they are actually royal blue,47481,3
47482,It is really long in every size.,47482,3
47483,I brought too small and material was thinner than expected.,47483,3
47484,This t shirt runs a little small so I gave it to my nephew.,47484,3
47484,On the good side the graphic printing was phenomenal.,47484,3
47485,Hopefully the stain is a marker and not blood.,47485,3
47485,Its not washing out.,47485,3
47485,This is a see through dress.,47485,3
47486,the fabric is kind of thin but for the price it's a good shirt..,47486,3
47486,I got a free pair of ear rings too :),47486,3
47489,"Not quite what I expected, poor finishing.",47489,3
47489,I gave a 3 star for the colour otherwise a 2,47489,3
47490,Not as supportive as I would have hoped,47490,3
47491,It fits very well if I have 20 pounds more.,47491,3
47491,Even It was slim-fit..,47491,3
47491,I cannot imagine how large regular fit is.,47491,3
47492,"Swimsuit came packaged as new with tags in plastic bags, but everything reeked of cigarette smoke.",47492,3
47492,"It was so rank, my husband refused to have it in the bedroom since it was stinking up the room.",47492,3
47493,I like it for the price.,47493,3
47493,It rolls and pushes my back fat up so you can see it in fitted shirts,47493,3
47494,Uncomfortable and fits oddly on my nose.,47494,3
47495,"Good fit, will be used for safety outerwear on construction sites.",47495,3
47495,I will purchase again in the near future.,47495,3
47497,It is a great jacket for the price.,47497,3
47497,Shoulders are a little snug and the gold flecks are a nice surprise as I didn't notice it on the picture.,47497,3
47498,I should have gotten a size larger but I was afraid it would be too big.,47498,3
47500,Super cute and I knew it ran small so I ordered a size up and it was still too small...sad,47500,3
47501,"Very thin to the point of poor quality, but that's what I should have expected considering the price.",47501,3
47501,"If you're particular amount sock quality, I would avoid these, but if you're indifferent the colors are great and designs are really cool.",47501,3
47502,They were ok but being a size 12 they were a little small.,47502,3
47503,Bleeds really bad so only wash with like colors!,47503,3
47504,I guess they would be great but they wouldn't go up over my calves.,47504,3
47504,I know  it  needs to be tight so they don't slide down but they should be elastic so they can stretch over your calves.,47504,3
47505,"Kind of hideous, but if you want something that shows off your body, this will do that.",47505,3
47506,"Not as wide of a tunnel as what I'm used to, but it's ok for the price.",47506,3
47507,Shrunk after first wash.,47507,3
47508,not great not bad.,47508,3
47510,Almost the entire bottom of the shoe has a velvet-like soft fabric portion.,47510,3
47510,Only the outside edge of the sole is plastic.,47510,3
47510,They were so slippery I couldn't wear them anywhere in my house except on carpet.,47510,3
47510,I didn't see this fabric bottom until I had them on and got up to walk and almost fell.,47510,3
47510,"I had to return them, which was a shame because they were comfy, and looked great!",47510,3
47511,These are very comfortable but the leg part does not stretch quite enough.,47511,3
47511,My ankle with a metal plate in it feel squeezed in these socks.,47511,3
47512,"The purse itself is great, good size with pockets inside.",47512,3
47512,I however am disappointed with the strap harness both side are broken.,47512,3
47512,Unable to use the extra strap it comes with.,47512,3
47513,5'6 140lbs size medium.. On the last hook it could have been tighter.,47513,3
47513,So I did like the fact that I still could use the middle hooks to get where I wanted it.,47513,3
47513,After a few weeks though I was no longer able to wear it as It was either working and reducing my size or the fabric had lost its stretchiness?,47513,3
47513,I'm not sure.. ?,47513,3
47513,But over all I don't feel as though I wasted my money.,47513,3
47513,I will still wear it under dresses when needed.,47513,3
47514,The brim is floppier than I expected.,47514,3
47514,"Kinda too flimsy in my opinion, but in the hat's defense its very lightweight.",47514,3
47514,I bought it to keep the sun off my face and it does that just fine and dandy so it's definitely functional.,47514,3
47514,"Maybe some dried sweat will stiffen up the brim... All in all I would probably try a different brand before I bought this one again, but this one is okay.",47514,3
47515,Three of the Port & Company's 5.4 oz.,47515,3
47515,100% cotton tee's were ordered.,47515,3
47515,"It was a disappointment that two of the three were only 98% cotton, 2% polyester.",47515,3
47515,"That 2% seemed to make a difference, because those did not seem as heavy as the 100% cotton tee.",47515,3
47516,"They definitely look the part, but my goodness they do not breathe at all.",47516,3
47516,The plastic is very uncomfortable.,47516,3
47516,I only needed them for one picture and then took them to the charity shop ASAP.,47516,3
47517,Chains are cute but the cross is very cheap.,47517,3
47518,The brim of this hat really needs to be made of another material.,47518,3
47518,"As soon as it gets the slightest bit wet, it collapses into my son's face.",47518,3
47518,"That led to him not wanting to keep the hat on, can't say I blame the poor little guy!",47518,3
47519,Had to return it because it fit great ever where around my body expect my boobs so by a size up if you have a large chest.,47519,3
47520,I ordered size 12-18 months.,47520,3
47520,These were too small for my 12 month old who normally wears a size 5.,47520,3
47520,They shipped from China and would have cost more to return than the purchase price.,47520,3
47520,The seller was cooperative with a refund though.,47520,3
47520,Otherwise would be a good shoe.,47520,3
47521,I usually wear a woman's medium but with I ordered a large since most reviews said order one size larger.,47521,3
47521,I would recommend getting 2 sizes up.,47521,3
47521,This doesn't fit me.,47521,3
47521,It was made well and the material is what I expected but the sizing is way off.,47521,3
47524,it is way bigger then a normal backpack so me being short makes it look weird.,47524,3
47524,now it is good quality but if your short it will look huge on you.,47524,3
47525,I am returning this shirt.,47525,3
47525,"Unfortunately, there were too many things that I did not like about it.",47525,3
47525,"I am a US size 6, normally a small or medium in shirts.",47525,3
47525,I am 5'4 and 128 pounds.,47525,3
47525,"I consider myself an ""hourglass shape.""",47525,3
47525,I followed the sizing guide and ordered a large in this shirt.,47525,3
47525,"First, I will comment on the good.",47525,3
47525,The color is as shown.,47525,3
47525,This is an orangy-peachy color.,47525,3
47525,The side lace detail is pretty and very on trend right now.,47525,3
47525,The product seemed to be of good quality.,47525,3
47525,There were no loose strings falling off this shirt.,47525,3
47525,"The bad: Despite following the sizing guide, I still felt this shirt was a bit too tight.",47525,3
47525,"The material is very clingy, meaning that all of your flaws are on full display.",47525,3
47525,"The material is also very thin, and somewhat see through.",47525,3
47525,"You pretty much HAVE to wear something underneath this shirt, which is bothersome because of how this runs small.",47525,3
47525,"I also felt that the shirt was a little bit short on me, which I was not expecting.",47525,3
47525,"Overall, this is a cute shirt and the price is decent, but the material was too clingy and see-through for my liking.",47525,3
47525,I am sure this shirt would look gorgeous on someone thinner than me!,47525,3
47526,I read the review about it being in Asian sizing so I ordered a size up but that was STILL too small!!!,47526,3
47526,Would recommend going two sizes up if you can.,47526,3
47526,"But, these shorts are still super cute and look just like the picture!",47526,3
47526,"Not super high waist, they hit right below the belly button!",47526,3
47527,Okay quality for price but sleeves where to short,47527,3
47528,"Very thin material, you can see every seam and dimple.",47528,3
47528,"The fit is nice, but it is a bit big.",47528,3
47529,"Size 2 fits me well (I'm 90 pounds), but the armhole is way too big.",47529,3
47529,Still keeping though since it's very pretty.,47529,3
47529,You have to wear this shirt with a cami under as it is see through.,47529,3
47530,"The foot area fit fine, I felt they needed insoles.",47530,3
47530,But the ankle/lower calf area was too small.,47530,3
47531,More snug in the chest than an extra large should be.,47531,3
47531,I felt it's a bit on the small side and doesn't give much in the stretch area.,47531,3
47531,"I like PattyBoutik because they offer clothes with a long torso, I felt this one could also be longer.",47531,3
47531,The neck like is very nice and it does flatter the tummy area well.,47531,3
47532,meant for tiny ppl.,47532,3
47532,Order the biggest available and it is still too small and I am not a very big person at all,47532,3
47533,This is not a top that I would write home about.,47533,3
47533,"The arm holes are very large (like a mens shirt), and the front part barely covers my chest (and that is not exactly a difficult task..).",47533,3
47533,"I think I like the idea of the top, just not maybe the construction.",47533,3
47533,It's definitely meant to be worn on a smaller framed individual (broad backs and shoulders need not apply).,47533,3
47533,The material is soft and the crochet on the back is pretty.,47533,3
47533,I actually wish it was constructed a little better so I could actually wear it more.,47533,3
47533,"That being said, I can't complain much considering the price.",47533,3
47533,Currently I'm using this top mainly as a cover-up at the beach/swimming pool due to the arm hole/chest coverage issues.,47533,3
47534,This is really too short to wear as anything but a bathing suit coverup.,47534,3
47535,Just way too small.,47535,3
47536,The skirt is well made and really pretty.,47536,3
47536,"It is quite shiny though,  I feel it made it much fancier than what I was looking for.",47536,3
47536,"I have a 29 inch waist and it was just snug enough to be a little uncomfortable,  like if I ate something I'd be wishing I wasn't in the skirt.",47536,3
47537,Awkward fit..top is a bit large but the bottom is a bit tight/small,47537,3
47539,Made Large...but very cute costume.,47539,3
47540,This is a cool lookin shirt but it is to small.,47540,3
47540,I wear a 14 1/2 in a dress shirt which is a small.,47540,3
47540,I ordered medium and it is more like an extra small very very tight.,47540,3
47540,For reference im small framed with a chest of around 40 inches and wear a 30/31 in jeans and this shirt in med on me was very tight all over.,47540,3
47540,I think the size chart for this shirt is off bad.,47540,3
47540,The material is nice and stretchy and the shirt looks good.,47540,3
47540,I gave it 3 stars due to the sizing being off.,47540,3
47540,I wish it had fit,47540,3
47541,The bottom looks blue on screen but it was definitely black.,47541,3
47541,The material is okay and it fit well but it's definitely a $20 bathing suit.,47541,3
47542,It looks realy nice on my husband!,47542,3
47542,However I think it runs small and the sleeves had to be worn rolled on  my hubby...but still a nice shirt!,47542,3
47543,These are fine for the price.,47543,3
47543,Logo was off center and looks like a possible fake.,47543,3
47544,I love this purse and I only have had the purse for over a month.,47544,3
47544,I'm very sad because the 1 main zipper broke already.,47544,3
47544,When I received the purse the main 2 zippers were very hard to zip up.,47544,3
47544,I would have thought for the money the zipper would last.,47544,3
47545,Perfect for no show but slip down off my heel a lot,47545,3
47546,This is really cute but you only get one so if you want to wear as sandals make sure to order 2 of them.,47546,3
47547,"Very cute just didn't fit, way too large for my lip but I have small lips.",47547,3
47547,I do believe the size was correct.,47547,3
47548,Just didn't look like the picture when I got it.,47548,3
47548,It seems like good quality but it didn't fit like the picture shows either.,47548,3
47550,Ok product fot the price.,47550,3
47550,Arrived missing an earring back.,47550,3
47550,They don't come up the ear as far as in the  picture.,47550,3
47550,One side doesn't like to stay clipped.,47550,3
47552,I wear a L but purchased XL based on reviewers saying to go a size up :(  No compression.,47552,3
47552,Will reorder and get a L and update.,47552,3
47552,I hope the next size works.,47552,3
47553,the metal piece that attaches the hand strap is broken and it didn't have the dangily piece it's also smaller than I thought very disappointed hopefully I will not have trouble sending it back being there was no receipt with it.,47553,3
47553,My husband was able to figure out that the handle piece screws into the inside of the purse.,47553,3
47553,Reading other reviews I found that the signature dangily piece was inside one of the compartments b so the 3 is for having to fix the handle and its smaller than I thought otherwise I like it,47553,3
47554,"Poor quality, wore it once and is falling apart.",47554,3
47555,Ok but kind of tents out at the chest .,47555,3
47555,Unflattering so I am returning it,47555,3
47556,It's a pretty ring but the ruby is not ruby like color when it's in light!,47556,3
47556,The ruby is more like kinda orange/red like...but I Like-It!,47556,3
47557,It is so short in the front.,47557,3
47557,My boobs felt like they were too big so I had to break one of the buttons off (they were fake...) to give more room for my boobs so it didn't feel so short in the front.,47557,3
47557,After that it got a little better...,47557,3
47557,But I still wish it were longer in the front.,47557,3
47558,had to return twice because the sleeves were uneven.,47558,3
47558,I own it in brown and it is amazing.,47558,3
47558,So as long as it is not defective it is great!\,47558,3
47560,"It shrunk a bit in the wash, but as a 5'3"" man the small size was wwaayy too large for me.",47560,3
47561,Great sweater really cute just order a size larger than what you would normally wear.,47561,3
47562,Order a size up if you want some give and stretch to it.,47562,3
47562,"It looks pretty from a distance and it's really comfortable, but it's shoddily put together with very obvious stitching.",47562,3
47562,My mom was easily able to fix these problems though.,47562,3
47563,I just received this bag in the mail toady and I was really excited and its so nice but I am going to have to return it.,47563,3
47563,It says theres enough room to fit a 13'' laptop and it is but not as it shows in the picture.,47563,3
47563,Now that I look at it again I realize with all the stuff it shows in the bag in the picture you wouldn't be able to zip it up.,47563,3
47563,I can barely fit my laptop in sideways with everything else I need.,47563,3
47563,"So that is very misleading and disappointing, though I read the dimensions the picture mislead me.",47563,3
47563,I will still order the bigger size but am sad to have to give up this navy color along with the small bag it comes with.,47563,3
47564,Top is small bottom fits good,47564,3
47565,"Love everything about this robe, minus two things: the size.",47565,3
47565,I'm an individual with a petite stature and I feel like I'm swimming in it.,47565,3
47565,I wish there was a sizing option because one-size does not fit all.,47565,3
47565,"Second, the color isn't true to the image.",47565,3
47565,I was expecting a green-blue mint.,47565,3
47565,Instead I feel I revived a more blue than green color.,47565,3
47565,I like it enough not to deal with the hassle of returning it.,47565,3
47566,Just order bigger size if you can.,47566,3
47567,"It is nice, but fits small",47567,3
47568,The dress was a bit itchy and the sequin desighn is not the same also the sides were  a little big,47568,3
47569,the problem is the lights in one of the shoes stopped working after only 2 days it was properly charged and one shoe works fine the other shoe does not only one light flashes.,47569,3
47570,It's beautiful but I have to get it tailored to fit me.,47570,3
47571,Very pretty but it broke at the top as soon as I got it,47571,3
47572,Not my favorite feel.,47572,3
47573,A bit too large for a man's wallet.,47573,3
47574,This skirt was cute but was way too small!,47574,3
47574,It also wrinkles very easily!,47574,3
47575,I loved this shirt when I first got it... but after 2-3 washes all the glitter (which you can't really see from the pic) washed off.,47575,3
47575,Now I'm left with an OK shirt with little glue dots all over it.,47575,3
47576,"Loveyly shirt, but it was too small for my daughter and she is average size.",47576,3
47577,"Very thin and very, very long...",47577,3
47578,I have an athletic body type - 135 lbs.,47578,3
47578,"5'4"" - so instead of a medium I bought one size up, and it fits snug around my ribcage.",47578,3
47578,"I usually wear bra size 38D, and I didn't know if the top half sometimes sliding off of my chest to one side meant it was too big or too small.",47578,3
47578,"It especially will slide with sharp movements - the chest parts all also VERY TRANSPARENT, so I would not recommend for an outer event nor a club unless you have pasties handy, but at home with the boyfriend, it's a cute little treat for the both of you on date night.",47578,3
47579,I love the  variety of different  jurie but here comes the bad part the plastic tips or balls will break so easy!,47579,3
47579,I have done tried a few and nope they break!!,47579,3
47579,So I'm not so sure u want to get this.,47579,3
47580,They seem to run longer in the legs by a good 2+ inches.,47580,3
47580,All other pants @ 32 leg length are fine but these are way long.,47580,3
47580,I would have returned them but out of the right size.,47580,3
47580,Quality seems good just requires tailoring,47580,3
47581,It's a bit thin but it is cute,47581,3
47582,"it doesn't really fit around my foot, and it only comes with one.",47582,3
47582,Thought I would like it more than I actually do.,47582,3
47583,i like it but it turned my finger green after wearing it once,47583,3
47584,Sexy but booty does show,47584,3
47585,Cute tights and they feel nice.,47585,3
47585,Only problem I have is the size.,47585,3
47585,Once it reaches my upper thighs it's a battle to get them to cover my butt.,47585,3
47587,I wasn't expecting it to be so sheer.,47587,3
47587,It will be a cute cover-up but not the dress I was hoping for.,47587,3
47588,"It's a nice scarf especially for the price, but was trying to match a skirt.",47588,3
47588,Not quite a match.,47588,3
47589,The face of the watch is perfect but the band is cheap.,47589,3
47589,I will be replacing it.,47589,3
47591,The items are very cheaply made and wouldn't make a good gift for a younger person who would be apt to break them.,47591,3
47591,Looks realistic but not very sturdy.,47591,3
47591,Would be excellent if you're a Harry Potter nerd and want to put them out on display though!,47591,3
47592,"Top is ridiculously small
Bottom was perfect",47592,3
47593,"It smelled so bad we left outside to air out, that didn't work so took the chance on washing it.",47593,3
47594,Started to come apart after first wearing.,47594,3
47595,I wear medium and ordered in L and XL.,47595,3
47595,Both way too small.,47595,3
47596,Go a size up.,47596,3
47596,"The dress is stretchy, but is designed for petite people.",47596,3
47596,"An XL was too small in the shoulders, and far too short for me.",47596,3
47596,"I'm 5' 8"" and 165lbs (I usually wear an XL or size US 12).",47596,3
47597,This item is not as described.,47597,3
47597,The picture is very faded & although I ordered the XL it looks like a medium.,47597,3
47597,I contacted the seller to return.,47597,3
47599,Great item but too large.,47599,3
47600,"The opening may end up being too small, but its a pretty piece",47600,3
47601,"much larger than I anticipated, not sure who would wear these comfortably.",47601,3
47602,This is a really cute bag but it was too small and I had to return it.,47602,3
47602,The color is gorgeous.,47602,3
47603,Love them but after wearing then a few days white shows through the black.,47603,3
47604,"It looks just its picture, I just wish it were bigger, but I am keeping it and wearing it with my casual nautical outfits.",47604,3
47604,It's nice when I just want something simple on my wrist.,47604,3
47604,A great buy for the price.,47604,3
47605,Fit small all my clothes are a large and this fit way to tight,47605,3
47606,Doesn't breath well but it is cool,47606,3
47607,I brought a Peter Grimm hat out of Costco it was a promotion demo in the store.,47607,3
47607,"I have the brown one...When i purchase the black one on line,well...the quality
of the hat was not near as good..Plus made smaller in style...",47607,3
47608,"I love it, thanx!",47608,3
47609,Okay outfit for something just to lounge around the house and maybe the store for errands.,47609,3
47610,This clincher fits big and isn't as thick as others I have ordered.,47610,3
47611,I bought it as a large pajama top so perfect that it fits large!,47611,3
47612,The dress is cute.,47612,3
47612,It fit great and is comfortable.,47612,3
47612,You may want a slip for under since it is thin.,47612,3
47612,It is very thin material and came without the belt.,47612,3
47612,I like it but I am not sure how many washes it will last through.,47612,3
47612,The stitching and material are not high quality.,47612,3
47612,It is worth the price as long as it last through a few months or wear.,47612,3
47615,I bought this item before...,47615,3
47615,This is my second time ordering it.,47615,3
47615,I do like the bracelet a lot unfortunately the pieces fall off the bracelet and you will have to buy a new one,47615,3
47616,The hat is not stiff enough.,47616,3
47616,I have to starch the hat to make it stiff,47616,3
47617,Fabric is a little thin but its a great undershirt for the price,47617,3
47618,"Fits large and super plain, looks prettier online than in person, sent it back",47618,3
47619,Like necklace better than earrings.,47619,3
47619,Earrings are cheap looking... Not enough turpuoise in them.,47619,3
47620,Really simple product and it looks great!,47620,3
47620,I wish it had some extra links though.,47620,3
47621,Had to give it away and the material was too shiny.,47621,3
47622,"As others have mentioned, the sizing is way off on these swimsuits.",47622,3
47622,"I have sent the seller a link that may help with adjusting her sizing labels, but had to send the suit back.",47622,3
47622,It was 10 sizes too small.,47622,3
47622,"The suit itself is super cute; the fabric, wonderful.",47622,3
47622,I wish I was that petite and could wear it!,47622,3
47622,I hope this seller listens to us and figures out American sizing!,47622,3
47622,"My suit came with a China return address, so I think that's part of the problem.",47622,3
47622,"When you have the sizing right, I'd love to take another look!",47622,3
47623,Very fragile and broke when I try to fit to my fingers.,47623,3
47624,"Too clear in the back, needs lining",47624,3
47625,Smaller than expected on full purse and inside.,47625,3
47626,"sweater is nice, zipper is not.",47626,3
47626,Super cheap zipper that doesn't work smoothly.,47626,3
47626,I would not recommend this product.,47626,3
47628,The size of these hats are ridiculous.,47628,3
47628,The has I received was 64cm.,47628,3
47628,Which is the equivalent of a 3XL hat.,47628,3
47628,And 3cm  larger than the largest size in the range listed in the ad.,47628,3
47628,"Additionally, that range is too large a variance to be reasonable in the first place.",47628,3
47628,The size range on the ad; 58cm to 61cm is the equivalent range of a 7 1/4 to 7 5/8.,47628,3
47628,This is a huge range for a hat so even if you happen to be in that range and you get a hat in the advertised range  the chance of getting a hat that fits well is about 1 in 3.,47628,3
47628,"Additionally, my hat was MUCH larger than the advertised range.",47628,3
47628,I do not think there are many people in the world with a 3XL head size.,47628,3
47628,I was able to get a refund but the hat is completely useless.,47628,3
47628,It is comically large.,47628,3
47628,If you have a huge head this may be the best option for you.,47628,3
47628,Because no other imperial hat on the market comes in sizes this huge.,47628,3
47629,"My only concern is that it runs large I read the reviews ahead of time before ordering and got a size 8 my daughter is 11 and it still was very big on her,  especially in the arms and chest area.",47629,3
47629,I didn't want to order any smaller because I was afraid it would mess up  the length.,47629,3
47629,I do not recommend this dress if your child is petite.,47629,3
47629,Otherwise than that it's a great dress.,47629,3
47629,Great quality inn fabric!,47629,3
47630,"Very thin material, more like boy-shorts (barely cover my booty).",47630,3
47630,"CanNOT wear these outside w/o something over it, the material is kinda sheer.",47630,3
47631,The bottom is shear and you will need to buy a separate slip.,47631,3
47631,I bought a full slip and it looks wonderful!,47631,3
47632,They are functional but stiff to the touch and a little difficult to put on.,47632,3
47633,This dress runs small so make sure you get a size up,47633,3
47634,Top was too small the bottoms were way too large,47634,3
47635,"I guess if you would like to preserve the ""quality"" of this hoodie, you shouldn't wash or dry it ever.",47635,3
47636,The waist fits a little loosely.,47636,3
47636,"And for some reason, these fit like bell-bottoms... the calf area does NOT sit fitted as it does it the image; rather it's baggy and loose, in a very strange way.",47636,3
47637,I got this to cover the front of an apron with blood.,47637,3
47637,It's so thick and viscous that it wanted to run off the fabric without sticking.,47637,3
47637,"I had to get the fabric wet first, and then put this on it to get it to thin out and bleed in.",47637,3
47637,I used a cheap turkey baster to keep it off my hands - it does stain your skin pink for a day or two.,47637,3
47638,They are supper cute but the jess face different ways when u put them on.,47638,3
47639,It was cheap and is cheap.,47639,3
47639,The picture looks creme but it is really white.,47639,3
47639,I ordered a small and it still was kind of big.,47639,3
47639,It also ripped easily.,47639,3
47641,Kind of tight for a size 16,47641,3
47642,"Description stated 51"" was not 47"".",47642,3
47642,"GOOD quality, just mislabeled size.",47642,3
47643,"Its aluminum or something, not metal.",47643,3
47643,But i do like that its extra long compared to most wallet chains.,47643,3
47643,It looks real cool and the design is awesome.,47643,3
47643,"But when you bang it on something when you're walking, it sounds cheap.",47643,3
47644,cute shirt just needs to be made in appropriate sizes,47644,3
47645,"Looks too cartoonish in real life,  doesn't really go with anything.",47645,3
47645,"Love the skirt colors, looks great on Model, just not with any top I own or can find.",47645,3
47646,This gown proved above and beyond expectations and held a class of its own.,47646,3
47646,I coupled the wine colored dress with gold heels at a red carpet event and everyone loved it.,47646,3
47646,The fit was great and my cousin who is a seamstress also had me purchase one for her in navy as well as she was also wowed by the dress.,47646,3
47647,"I got one of each color, they fit weird and are kinda big.",47647,3
47647,"I got a small of each, I'm not sure why but they are made super weird.",47647,3
47647,Rounded in the front and back with a slitted side.,47647,3
47647,They are comfy though and good workout clothes.,47647,3
47647,VERY see through though.,47647,3
47649,"I came off and also when i put it in my wallet, my phone kept turning on.",47649,3
47650,"Made nicely, but doesn't fit...",47650,3
47651,"I wish it came in different colors and not look so wrinkled all the time, But the picture was good.",47651,3
47652,"The colors are beautiful, exactly the shades we wanted.",47652,3
47652,"However, it's marketed as a jacket but we received a fairly thin sweatshirt.",47652,3
47652,"Our daughter does well in cold temperatures, so she'll get a lot of use out of this before the weather turns enough to force her into a coat, but we were looking for a letterman jacket for her to wear as a main coat.",47652,3
47652,"I suppose the price should have clued me in, but I think we'll get $19 use out of this.",47652,3
47653,I bought this stuff to put on some clothes for a halloween costume.,47653,3
47653,"I had a white dress and my boyfriend had a white shirt, tie, slacks and a vest.",47653,3
47653,"The blood was the last application after the mud/dirt/tears, so I was going to splatter some and soak the sleeves.",47653,3
47653,"This stuff looks great when it's wet, and when it's on skin; however, putting it on clothes it was barely visible and turned an awful orange color.",47653,3
47653,"Luckily we didn't have a lot to apply on the clothing, mostly just our skin, but man this stuff looked incredibly odd.",47653,3
47654,Credit cards fall out all the time.,47654,3
47654,I would not  buy this again!!!.,47654,3
47654,I would like my money back.,47654,3
47654,the credit cards fall out all the time.,47654,3
47654,I didn't have it more 5 minutes and my credit cards fell out.,47654,3
47654,The zipper tab came off I fixed it.,47654,3
47655,"After I wore it a day, I noticed that one side of the hem was a little off but I thought it was just me.",47655,3
47655,After removing it and taking a closer look - I realized the hemline was poorly cut and it was not straight at all.,47655,3
47655,I didn't return it as it fits the bill for what I purchased it for - something really comfortable to wear around the house after surgery (really comfortable waistband) but I can't give a 5-star review as the hemline is really wonky and crooked.,47655,3
47655,It's unfortunate that I can't wear it out later.,47655,3
47655,The charcoal color is nice and material is soft.,47655,3
47655,Just really poorly cut.,47655,3
47657,I have 4 other purses by this company.,47657,3
47657,The quality is very good.,47657,3
47657,The purses wash and hang dry perfectly.,47657,3
47657,All my other purses from this company are fantastic.,47657,3
47657,This particular purse arrived with a very heavy smell similar to moth balls.,47657,3
47657,"So far, I cannot get the smell out.",47657,3
47657,I hung the purse so it could air out.,47657,3
47657,I sprayed it with Febreze.,47657,3
47657,"Then, I machine washed it.",47657,3
47657,"So far, the smell is still too strong for the purse to be usable.",47657,3
47657,I like the purse enough that I haven't given up.,47657,3
47658,This is a decent sweatshirt...the length in the arms are a bit short...thought it be a little heavier fabric too.,47658,3
47659,Size can't wear them they are everything I was hoping for just can't wear them,47659,3
47660,Wasn't really impressed with these.,47660,3
47660,I think the material is okay but they seemed short and wide to me.,47660,3
47661,Size is smaller than I antisapated,47661,3
47662,the buckle is heavy.,47662,3
47662,But its cool how it locks.,47662,3
47663,"Son loved them, but couldn't wear them long due to being so small.",47663,3
47663,Order a size up!,47663,3
47664,"never did get all of the hoops, I tried and finally gave up.",47664,3
47665,"This top is better than fine but not great...
Pros: it is long enough to wear with leggings, and it's comfortable.",47665,3
47665,"Cons: it's a ribbed knit material so it's a little heavier weight, it runs small (I normally wear a medium but got a large bc of other reviews and it's still a little tight), and the lace doesn't match the rest of the shirt.",47665,3
47665,I got the charcoal grey and the lace is like a greenish grey.,47665,3
47665,I still like this top but I'm not sure I will order more of this kind which is a bummer bc it looks so cute online.,47665,3
47666,Pretty thin rubber though.,47666,3
47666,"And the design is stretched around the ankle area, making sime of the dinosaurs look a little weird.",47666,3
47666,But my 7 year old doesn't care.,47666,3
47667,"This is a cute swimsuit, but I was worried about the fit...",47667,3
47667,Turns out I was right - if you're large chested this is probably not going to work.,47667,3
47667,Fit was good everywhere but the chest.,47667,3
47667,"I would say just size up on the top, but since it's sold as a set you can't really do that.",47667,3
47667,In my case the bottom part fit great.,47667,3
47668,The waist portion is too high and creeps up into the bust area.,47668,3
47668,The top should be more proportionate to the size of the dress.,47668,3
47668,It looks like a size L top with a size 2x skirt.,47668,3
47668,Not enough room between the shoulders and the elastic waist so that the waist actually would land on my ribs instead of on my breasts.,47668,3
47668,"Otherwise, the color is great, the neckline is great, but I can't really wear it.",47668,3
47669,Uglier than the picture.,47669,3
47670,This material was different than other palazzo pants I've purchased.,47670,3
47670,It wasn't clear in the posting which fabric was used to create these pants.,47670,3
47670,Just not for me.,47670,3
47671,"Great quality, but tight around the hips.",47671,3
47672,Nice shoes but I wear a women's 4 1/2 and I bought a pair of kids size 3 a couple of years ago and they fit great but these are a little longer and wider than the older ones so I'm kinda disappointed but since I've wore them I can't send them back but they're made very well,47672,3
47673,I love the top in general.,47673,3
47673,I have one in white as well.,47673,3
47673,The lace on this one is stitched on crooked.,47673,3
47674,I bought one size larger because I know vans run small but they still feel like there two sizes small..,47674,3
47674,I love vans been wearing them my whole life but if you get these and have a wide foot I would order three sizes bigger then you foot size at least,47674,3
47675,Bottoms got good top fits but it only covers not even half my boobs.,47675,3
47675,"I seeee a bra to it so I can still wear it
I wear normally a xl and I ordered xxl",47675,3
47676,"Charm is smaller than anticipated and is very light weight, but good detail.",47676,3
47677,I wear women size x-small or junior small.,47677,3
47677,"I order medium size after reading the reviews.it fits comfortable,small would be little tight .the color is too bright yellow ,material is ok , not great.",47677,3
47677,you get what you pay for.,47677,3
47678,I love the shirt but if you have a long torso don't buy this shirt.,47678,3
47678,It felt like a teen large but it works for me.,47678,3
47679,I just received mine.,47679,3
47679,Definitely  not a leather smell (which I love).,47679,3
47679,Smells synthetic if anything - and almost overpowering .,47679,3
47679,The wallet does  not even look like leather and neither does the wrist strap.,47679,3
47679,Card slots not really convenient.,47679,3
47679,Size of wallet is great and my Samsung Note 4 fits in easily.,47679,3
47679,Not sure whether I'll keep it as it sort of looks cheap.,47679,3
47679,But maybe that's because of the colour I chose.,47679,3
47679,I'll give it  day or two to see if it grows on me and the un-leather smell (stink) dissipates.,47679,3
47679,I even put the little sachet meant for an undies drawer in it to see if that helps!,47679,3
47680,"wife tried this on, top fit ok. boobs were sagging from it.",47680,3
47680,the bottoms was the problem.,47680,3
47680,"got it to look right in the front but then in the back her crack was showing, pulled it up in the back and it was way to low in the front.",47680,3
47681,The tights feel great but the sizing is completely off.,47681,3
47681,If you are curvy these barely fit.,47681,3
47682,"Beautiful little dress,  just way too small.",47682,3
47682,Excellent quality for it's price.,47682,3
47683,"super cute, but way to big and i got a small",47683,3
47684,Cute top... Too small...,47684,3
47685,Daughter like it.. but don't seem to be great material,47685,3
47686,"I reurned one of the sun glasses and had a hard time to get my custome charge, also the US dollar rate had been changed and I lost some money there too",47686,3
47687,Guess I didn't think this through before I ordered it.,47687,3
47687,"Looks like my Grandpa's PJ top, but it is cool and comfy.",47687,3
47687,Will keep to wear around the house (or to Walmart).,47687,3
47688,"The color choices are great, but the sizing is awful.",47688,3
47688,"These wouldn't even qualify to be labeled as an ""average"" length and can only be accurately described as a ""tall"" cut.",47688,3
47688,"The only people that aren't going to have to form a cuff by folding the pant legs up 2-3 times are women who are over 5'7"" tall.",47688,3
47688,"And, because the fold is not permanent, it means that I will have to have alterations made.",47688,3
47688,"Other than the disappointment with the item not being accurately described, they do seem to be made well enough and of a nice weight material.",47688,3
47689,"Fits a little weird, you get what you pay for",47689,3
47690,I had to return the shoes... the lights did not work and the control came with no brief instructions :(,47690,3
47691,Its cute but somewhat of an itchy material.,47691,3
47691,Had a slight chemical smell but after being washed it went away.,47691,3
47692,The color is beautiful.,47692,3
47692,With a slip it should be fine.,47692,3
47693,They are nice just a bit thin.,47693,3
47694,"Bottom hem cut a bit longer on one side and then bunched a little as it was sewn.... Not very noticeable, and still a decent cover-up",47694,3
47695,"Just plastic wire, but for the price it's OK.  My 9 year old granddaughter thinks it's stylish 'tho I'm not overly impressed",47695,3
47696,One red and one black.,47696,3
47696,Both colors were wrong.,47696,3
47696,Got orange and white.,47696,3
47696,Although nice disappointed that they are not exactly what I ordered.,47696,3
47696,May just keep them and order a black pair and hope I get that color as the they are really cute.,47696,3
47697,good for the beach only,47697,3
47699,"Bunches up, rolls down.",47699,3
47699,But smoothes out and can't be seen under clothes.,47699,3
47699,"It's too short to cover up back fat, so it in turn makes it stick out even more because it's squeezing the rest of you.",47699,3
47699,Mine was too small and eventually started to tear after 3 wears.,47699,3
47699,You are getting what you pay for,47699,3
47700,"This is made well, but if you're over 5'6 don't waste your time.",47700,3
47700,"I'm 5'8, ordered a large and there's no way...",47700,3
47702,The top is cute but very small.,47702,3
47703,Is a nice looking hat to wear at work.,47703,3
47703,The only negative I have about it is that it's kind of shallow and sits high,47703,3
47704,"This is pretty cute, it's cheap but you get what you pay for.",47704,3
47704,"It's fairly short, the photo makes it look about mid length but I'd say it's about mid thigh for an average height.",47704,3
47705,A little small doesnt quite fit across the chest,47705,3
47706,"its too small, make the sizes bigger and the outer material with cotton, not rain coat material",47706,3
47707,"I'm 5'9"" and regular 10/12.",47707,3
47707,Top was way too short for my liking,47707,3
47709,Stone fell out but they replaced it,47709,3
47710,"I really liked this item but wow, was it big for the size!!",47710,3
47710,Very long...I am only 5 foot 5 inches and it hit my mid thigh.,47710,3
47710,I gave it to my niece who is much taller than I am since shipping was going to be way expensive to return.,47710,3
47710,She looks great in it!,47710,3
47711,"It toooooooook forever to arrive, but it did come from China, so I can't complain.",47711,3
47711,"The pendent is very nice, the kitty is freaking adorbs, and it's constructed well.",47711,3
47711,"The chain it came with, though?",47711,3
47711,It's like 10.5 inches long.,47711,3
47711,It would choke a toddler.,47711,3
47711,It's the strangest length I have ever seen.,47711,3
47711,I have no idea who would wear this chain.,47711,3
47711,"It's extra weird, because the pendant is sort of big (not huge, but way too big for a kid's necklace, in case I just misunderstood the whole affair and this was meant for a child).",47711,3
47711,Or was it meant for a cat?,47711,3
47711,A meta necklace for a cat?,47711,3
47711,Should I try that?,47711,3
47711,"So, subtracting a star because now I have to find something to hang it on, and though that's a first world problem, it's a pain.",47711,3
47711,"It's brass, so I have to find a match, and...whine.",47711,3
47711,"Or, I will just get lazy and give it to my cat.",47711,3
47711,He's been eyeballing it anyway.,47711,3
47711,Be prepared with your own chain.,47711,3
47713,Love the swim suit.,47713,3
47713,Should have ordered a size bigger.,47713,3
47714,It'll be fine after I drop a few bags of groceries.,47714,3
47715,the color fades on first wash,47715,3
47716,Perfect gift for my Maid of Honor.,47716,3
47717,I ended up finding one that fit me much better,47717,3
47718,"When I first received the umbrella, I really liked it.",47718,3
47718,"When we finally got some significant rain with wind, I was able to use it.",47718,3
47718,"I noticed a little later, after the window to return had closed, that the seam along one edge was starting to tear.",47718,3
47718,I'm not sure how much longer the umbrella will be useful.,47718,3
47718,I think the manufacturer should redesign the seams along the edges to be reinforced for long lasting wear.,47718,3
47719,I like it but it is not as bright and beautiful as the picture shows.,47719,3
47719,Would be 5 stars if colors were more vibrant/ clear.,47719,3
47720,They were too small.,47720,3
47720,That's my fault for knowing the exact size I needed.,47720,3
47720,"They look really pretty, wish I could have worn one.",47720,3
47721,I absolutely love the jumper however i had to get it hem and my hips and butt was to big for the zipper.,47721,3
47721,I ordered a medium b/c I wear a 10 but If i got a bigger size it would have been to big in the bust  and I'm a 36D.,47721,3
47721,I did manage to wear it to a wedding though and got a lot of complements,47721,3
47722,"fit a little akward; seemed ""clingy"" in areas and would not lay right.",47722,3
47723,"Very reasonable price, ok for a casual shoe.",47723,3
47723,Do not recommend for exercising or standing all day.,47723,3
47724,"The fit was fine on the bottom, but I don't know who they designed the top for.",47724,3
47724,My breasts were squashed.,47724,3
47724,The fit was simply terrible and I had to return the item.,47724,3
47724,"That said, it was well made and the return was simple.",47724,3
47725,Not as great as I would've liked but a fun shirt for around the house,47725,3
47726,The fabric does not look like the picture.,47726,3
47726,It is more of a weird stretchy t-shirt material.,47726,3
47726,It does not slouch or flow as depicted.,47726,3
47726,Not thrilled but too lazy to send it back to China for the price I paid.,47726,3
47727,A lot thinner then described,47727,3
47728,"It's a shame when you get your dream field jacket and find the left arm inside liner is sewed in a twisted way, so you almost can't pass you arm through it...",47728,3
47729,They don't specify the right length,47729,3
47730,"I did NOT get these at a reduced price, I paid full price.",47730,3
47730,I bought these to go with the moon ring set from the same seller.,47730,3
47730,"I got them just for fun and with the idea that they would only last me one, maybe two seasons.",47730,3
47730,I have very small fingers (size 5) and it is really hard for me to find rings that fit.,47730,3
47730,These did not fit very well either.,47730,3
47730,All pieces arrived in great shape without anything broken.,47730,3
47730,Most of the rings are too big.,47730,3
47730,Only one of them was I able to adjust down to wear as a midi ring.,47730,3
47730,The bracelet is really big on me and I struggled to open it.,47730,3
47730,I just left it closed and forced it on and off my wrist.,47730,3
47730,Thank goodness I am so small because I barely got it on and off.,47730,3
47730,"The first thing I did after I sized them was to put a coat of silver polish, then a clear coat on them.",47730,3
47730,The silver added a little bit of bulk and texture while the clear coat ensured my fingers would not turn green.,47730,3
47730,I usually do that with all of my costume jewelry- just in case.,47730,3
47730,These are really fun and I am so sad the elephant does not fit.,47730,3
47730,"It is sort of sizeable in that you can make it bigger, but it only goes so small- bummer.",47730,3
47730,It ends up just sliding around my finger and ends up in my palm.,47730,3
47730,I kinda figured these would not last long so I am not terribly upset at it.,47730,3
47730,"As far as costume jewelry goes,  they are not the cheapest out there.",47730,3
47730,"If something were to happen to them, I would replace them.",47730,3
47730,I got a bunch of compliments on them and they look great in pics- which is half the reason why I bought them.,47730,3
47730,"Just be aware that if you are smaller like me, they will be big and you will have to work on them to get them to fit.",47730,3
47731,"The product is okay, the collar is a little awkward fit.",47731,3
47731,"I like well fitted clothes, this one is about 2"" long in length.",47731,3
47731,I probably won't buy these t-shirts again.,47731,3
47732,I love them just a little too big,47732,3
47733,I am fairly large chested with a small waist so I purposely bought a small (for the bottoms) and a large (for the top).,47733,3
47733,I was sad to find that they are a horrible fit.,47733,3
47733,The large was still too small for my d size boobs and the small was to large for my tiny ass.,47733,3
47733,They don't look nearly as good as the model shown either.,47733,3
47735,The fit isn't the best.,47735,3
47735,Its definitely smaller than expected.,47735,3
47735,Its also more of a warm tan color than shown in pictures.,47735,3
47736,"Cute sentiment, print on tshirt a bit heavy and stiff.",47736,3
47736,XL is a bit small as XL's go.,47736,3
47737,The quality of the fabric is not as I expected,47737,3
47738,"The shirt is cute, but I think the hi-lo description is a bit off.",47738,3
47738,I think the back is a lot longer than it shows on the picture.,47738,3
47738,"But it is still cute on, with a pair of legging.",47738,3
47739,"I bought 2 of these, and they are both the same size.",47739,3
47739,"They are a little small for my 00 gauges ears, so they slip, but a pair of o-rings is a quick remedy and doesn't detract from their beauty.",47739,3
47739,The color is deceptive online.,47739,3
47739,"When the light shines through them, they are that clear, brilliant blue you see in the listing.",47739,3
47739,"If the light is not shining through them, they are kind of metallic-looking, like the surface is not as clean or clear as I would like.",47739,3
47739,"On another note, I have dropped them a few times (I'm a klutz, what can I say?",47739,3
47739,"), and they haven't broken yet.",47739,3
47740,I didn't like the size of the product.,47740,3
47740,"It is very small, the picture shows a much larger earring.",47740,3
47740,The quality is pretty good sterling silver.,47740,3
47741,More of a crop top than a sweater.,47741,3
47742,just long enough for my big suitcase.,47742,3
47742,Nothing too special about it,47742,3
47743,The chain's broke within a couple of days,47743,3
47744,the slippers while really cute would not stay on my son's feet,47744,3
47745,"It's really cute, looks like the picture, just too big for my nose.",47745,3
47746,Was very cute but it wasn't that sot and it not only smelled bad but made our baby's head mell bad.,47746,3
47746,(And you know how good baby's heads smell.),47746,3
47746,fit our 2 week old well.,47746,3
47747,"very pretty but not made very well , they snag easily and the edges come unstiched",47747,3
47748,"Cute, but the sewing was coming apart.",47748,3
47749,Cute but don't put a lot in,47749,3
47750,They're made of thinner material than expected.,47750,3
47751,"It is cheaply made, definitely runs small.",47751,3
47751,"Also, it is very see through and thin, not as thick as the picture looks",47751,3
47752,They seemed like good winter hiking pants but were too tight in the upper thigh area.,47752,3
47753,Just a little big for a XXL.,47753,3
47754,too small  & thin fabric,47754,3
47755,Made for persons with a longer torso,47755,3
47756,"Very cute, but my son has figured out how to take them off because they don't have the flap that buttons over the zipper tab at the top.",47756,3
47757,"The balls were stuck on 2 of the earrings, couldn't get them off.",47757,3
47757,2 stars off for that.,47757,3
47758,very cute but much too small.,47758,3
47758,the arms are very tight.,47758,3
47759,This item seems to fit OK and is cute as pictured.,47759,3
47759,It is not the softest material it is more like you would expect in a slightly older baby outfit than most of what you see today.,47759,3
47759,"It is not harsh or scratchy on the baby skin but it is not her favorite outfit to wear as it doesn't have the stretch and softness she is usually used to, overall this is a very cute outfit for the price.",47759,3
47760,"Ordered a larger size, sizing chart does not seem right especially in the bust area.",47760,3
47761,When I typed in Sand socks these came up.,47761,3
47761,"NOT worth their money for the sand, The second time I wore the green pair the sand burned a hole right through!",47761,3
47761,So If you plan on using these for the hot sand at the beach don't buy!,47761,3
47762,Its nice but came a little damaged.,47762,3
47763,The top fits perfect!,47763,3
47763,The shirt is a little small and the pattern seems to be off but overall it is a nice outfit !,47763,3
47764,"I was hoping this dress would work for me, but alas-the life of a tall girl can be difficult.",47764,3
47764,"I am 5'10"" and wear either an XL or XXL depending on the brand.",47764,3
47764,I ordered this dress in an XL since it has some stretch to it.,47764,3
47764,The dress fit great around the bust and waist but was far too short for me.,47764,3
47764,It fell about 3 inches above my ankles.,47764,3
47764,"It is super cute and nice comfy material but the length was just a deal breaker, will be returning unfortunately.",47764,3
47765,"The color is true and rich, and the silk feels wonderful.",47765,3
47765,To me the overall appearance just not quite there.,47765,3
47765,It was originally bought as a gift.,47765,3
47765,I have decided to keep it for me.,47765,3
47765,The winters are very cold and this should add a very comfortable layer around my neck.,47765,3
47766,"It does run small, but it is super lightweight and cute.",47766,3
47767,"Great fabric, cut, and feel.",47767,3
47767,Color is very vibrant.,47767,3
47767,Sizing just runs a size big.,47767,3
47768,I got a lot of complements,47768,3
47769,It is a bit loose and tends to fly off.,47769,3
47769,Wonder if there is a way to fix it.,47769,3
47769,The hat itself is of good quality and well built.,47769,3
47770,"I like this bathing suit a lot, however it wasn't a gold sequence it was silver.",47770,3
47770,Other than that I like it a lot.,47770,3
47771,The material is a little thin but it's cute.,47771,3
47772,It's nice dress but too short too small,47772,3
47773,It's a open weave so be aware of that.,47773,3
47773,It's also a little stratchy but that's nothing a little fabric softener won't fix.,47773,3
47773,The sleeves are a little short but it look okay rolled up.,47773,3
47773,It also came with a overwhelming plastic smell that made my eyes burn and made me gag.,47773,3
47773,So this requires a wash before wear.,47773,3
47773,Not worth $10 though.,47773,3
47773,Maybe more like $5 and I wouldn't be AS disappointed.,47773,3
47773,"It's a cute cardigan, just not very comfortable.",47773,3
47773,"If you're a comfort over style kinda person, I wouldn't buy this.",47773,3
47773,But it's not too bad if you want something cute but don't want to pay a lot of money.,47773,3
47774,"It says small, but since it is loose fit, this fit on me.",47774,3
47774,I usually wear 7-8 US size.,47774,3
47775,"This charm is simply ""ok."" I wish I'd held out and paid for the authentic Pandora.",47775,3
47775,Those familiar with the brand name will notice immediately the difference in quality.,47775,3
47776,They are super super cute but too short for me!,47776,3
47776,"I am 5' 10"" and they don't go high enough.",47776,3
47776,Just barely over my knee :(,47776,3
47777,They are only flatlocked around the neck.,47777,3
47777,Slightly large / low cut so I hope they don't stretch out.,47777,3
47777,Very thin but soft material.,47777,3
47777,Nice long length (I'm short)  I will update if they wear out fast.,47777,3
47778,Not as thick as I would have wanted.,47778,3
47779,Defiantly not the quality of shirt I would wear to work.,47779,3
47779,"But the shirts are fine for Saturday projects, camping, or casual days.",47779,3
47779,The fit is tapered so you might want 1 size larger than normal if you have a gut.,47779,3
47779,Not worth any more than the $20 they sell for.,47779,3
47780,It was Christmas gift for a close friend.,47780,3
47780,She loves the necklace but she can't wear it because the chain is shorter than expected so she has to buy a chain that fits other than that the pendant was a hit with her.,47780,3
47781,"Nice design, and beautiful colors, however I wear a Large to X-large, and because this comes in Chinese sizes, I ordered a 2XL and it is way too small.",47781,3
47781,More like a Medium in US sizes.,47781,3
47782,It runs small so be careful.,47782,3
47782,Especially for the price.,47782,3
47783,I am a 34C the top fit perfectly but the bottoms did not.,47783,3
47783,"I don't have a really big butt, but I have one so the bottoms did not fit.",47783,3
47783,I wear a size 3 to 5 in pants or a small.,47783,3
47783,The bottoms are like briefs not really bikini bottoms so the did not come high enough on my hips because of my butt.,47783,3
47783,I'm just going to stick with string bikinis now to be able to adjust it.,47783,3
47784,"The coat seemed well-made and it fit well throughout the body, but the sleeves were 3-4 inches too long.",47784,3
47784,So I returned it.,47784,3
47787,"I bought these boots because I love the fringe, but the first pair were somewhat uncomfortable to wear and they have not much support.",47787,3
47787,"So I am sending them back but I ordered a  larger size and when they came the were a bit big, but I planned it that way so I could insert a support in them.",47787,3
47787,I hope I can wear them more than an hour.,47787,3
47790,"Runs very small, not the material I expected, gave it away...",47790,3
47791,"I am generally small, but right now I have a big 31-week pregnant belly, and these fit over my belly and don't really fall down - I love it!",47791,3
47791,They did smell chemically; had to wash them a couple of times.,47791,3
47792,I gave it 3 stars because it does fit.,47792,3
47792,But to be honest it is not flattering.,47792,3
47792,I wear a size 22 and I received the 3X.,47792,3
47792,Again it fits but it really does not do anything for me.,47792,3
47792,I will keep it and try to dress it up.,47792,3
47793,"Really small, size up!",47793,3
47794,cute but too small,47794,3
47795,"Not the material expected, way to big, but they are cute!",47795,3
47796,A bit bulky and the peacock head sticks out too much.,47796,3
47796,However it is still high quality and nice overall,47796,3
47797,These are very cute design and they seem like they will fit anyone but please be ware that they run super small.,47797,3
47797,I was able to get these for me but they fit my daughter.,47797,3
47797,"So unless you are getting these for a twig person, beware of the sizes.",47797,3
47797,Always go up a few sizes.,47797,3
47797,The material is very strong and can handle the washing machine and the dryer just fine.,47797,3
47797,"While they were too small for me, before I washed them, I was able to shrink them more in the dryer to get them to fit my daughter so not all was lost.",47797,3
47797,For the price on these jeggings they are hard to pass up.,47797,3
47797,"Doesn't matter who they fit, $3.00 for some Jeggings is amazing.",47797,3
47798,This is cute small and I ordered a 5 which came to small.,47798,3
47798,Order a size up.,47798,3
47799,"They looked very nice, but they were supposed to be a pair of clip on rings but were for pierced ears instead.",47799,3
47799,Had to go and buy some adapters to make them work.,47799,3
47800,"Cute and comfy, but runs small and is quite see through.",47800,3
47801,"The bottom was way too small for my bottom, but the top fit perfectly, and is easily adjustable in every way, but stays in place fairly well once tied.",47801,3
47801,"The cups do slide on the string, so if you plan on heavily exercising, you may find that the cups slide to the side.",47801,3
47801,Normal beach activities shouldn't be much of a problem unless you're D or higher sized.,47801,3
47801,"Cup pads were thick enough, but slightly smaller than expected, may slide up just a bit if not tied properly.",47801,3
47801,"The color (red) was brighter than the picture depicted, but was close enough for my taste.",47801,3
47801,"All in all for the price, I can't complain, and plan on wearing it as long as it'll stay together.",47801,3
47803,The middle section is a little lumpy.,47803,3
47803,I was expecting a smoother look.,47803,3
47803,I would like the length to be shorter.,47803,3
47804,These were great bc my BFF is a vegetarian and wanted a leather like wallet but without the leather.,47804,3
47804,"The pockets for the cards could be better, the little liners pulled out easy.",47804,3
47805,battery fail after 3 hours and will not recharge.,47805,3
47807,I returned the product.,47807,3
47807,I did what all reviews did and ordered two sizes up.,47807,3
47807,I actually love the design and the fact that the bra part is sewn in.,47807,3
47807,The torso was still too short though.,47807,3
47807,I did end up going to target and nabbed a similar one.,47807,3
47807,"The torso from target fits better, but this design and shape is definitely better.",47807,3
47807,"Next time amazon, next time.",47807,3
47809,But VERY VERY big!!,47809,3
47809,I ordered a medium because I wear a medium in just about everything and it looks like a lg/xl.,47809,3
47809,"Just a heads up, order a size down!",47809,3
47809,But got here fast.,47809,3
47810,Back posts are kind of long.,47810,3
47810,But the earrings are pretty.,47810,3
47810,The back part that holds the earring on are plastic.,47810,3
47810,That was unexpected but not surprised for the cost,47810,3
47811,Just didn't hang right,47811,3
47812,Bought this because I though it would be cooler.,47812,3
47812,It is mor formal than my baseball hats.,47812,3
47814,Feel great on like pajamas.,47814,3
47814,Fabric is nice but after wearing them a little while the knees bag.,47814,3
47814,They are nice foe maybe a second pair,47814,3
47815,Good quality shoes but the fit is relatively small compare to other shoes we have.,47815,3
47815,I have already ordered 1 size up and is still slightly tight.,47815,3
47816,I wish it was a lot bigger!,47816,3
47817,Definitely  order  one  size  smaller.,47817,3
47817,"Wash  in  cold  water  before  wearing,  the  dye  stains.",47817,3
47817,"Otherwise,  a  decent  product.",47817,3
47818,I bought a separate holster and had to rework and restitch it to get it to somewhat fit.,47818,3
47818,I think the flashing lights and accompanying noise are a little juvenile but it IS a toy after all.,47818,3
47819,nice quality not very stylish,47819,3
47820,Mine came with a hole.,47820,3
47821,It came to me as if it was used and had a smell to it.,47821,3
47821,Here is a pic of what it looked like...Like someone was rolling on the ground with it.,47821,3
47822,Hubby LOVED this T-Shirt....After second washing there was holes under both arms where the stitching had come out.....Not please at all....I shouldn't have to be hand sewing something that is less than two weeks old....I will not purchase from this company again....,47822,3
47823,There a little scratchy.,47823,3
47823,If you plan on wearing them lots I'd  look for cotton spandex ones.,47823,3
47823,Fit good and they're not see through.,47823,3
47824,Thin material for a skull-cap.,47824,3
47824,Inadequate for very cold weather but ok for cool weather.,47824,3
47824,Does stuff-down into a pocket well due to its relatively thin material.,47824,3
47825,The sleeves have pink ruffles that are cute but are extremely itchy and bothersome.,47825,3
47826,Have not tried this yet but it appears to be cheaply made and its components are quite small.,47826,3
47827,Overall the costume was what I was looking for expect for the size.,47827,3
47827,I ordered a size medium (typically I'm a 6/8) but the size fit like an x-large.,47827,3
47827,"The sleeves, waist and length all need to be taken in.",47827,3
47827,For the future I would have ordered an x-small or at least small.,47827,3
47829,"I liked costume, but I had to cut the stockings in order to get them pulled up all the way.",47829,3
47830,It's a nice dress.,47830,3
47830,Not what I expected but it's okay,47830,3
47831,Beautiful product just runs really small!,47831,3
47834,Great for a minions costume!,47834,3
47834,"They do not fit my husband's size XL head, but fit my small head fine.",47834,3
47835,"Faded after first wash, very small.",47835,3
47836,"Good shirt, runs small.",47836,3
47838,I wish it was true to size but it is not.,47838,3
47838,It does fit me but I wanted a looser fit.,47838,3
47838,Also it is thicker material than most out there so it isn't sheer like the ones I have seen.,47838,3
47839,"Pretty clutch ,the size is perfect for those who have a petite frame.",47839,3
47839,"However, the stones stuck on the clasp at the top are of a very poor quality.",47839,3
47840,Graphic is not as vibrant as I would like.,47840,3
47840,"However, it works as a comfortable shirt to sleep in.",47840,3
47840,Take that however you want.,47840,3
47841,Had t [ return for larger size.,47841,3
47841,Jacket is full two sizes off.,47841,3
47841,Jacket is good material.,47841,3
47842,"Bought a 3XL, not because I'm huge but because I expect it to shrink.",47842,3
47842,"But out of the box it's barely a 2X, and once it's washed it'll be somewhere near a boys' size 18.",47842,3
47843,"This is kind of hot- doesn't really breathe well so it didn't work so great at the beach, and the bust is a little small, other than that, it's great.",47843,3
47844,Too large and super loose in the middle...,47844,3
47845,"Nice wallet/wristlet, but did not fit Iphone 6+.",47845,3
47847,"Pretty shirt but in the new ""clingy"" fabric.",47847,3
47847,For those with a perfect figure.,47847,3
47848,The product is excellent.,47848,3
47848,I ordered a 2XL which is what another similar hat I have and it fits.,47848,3
47848,But this was sized  smaller and there is no 3X available.,47848,3
47848,So I ended up returning it.,47848,3
47849,"As stated by other reviewers, this bracelet does NOT hold hair ties.",47849,3
47849,The groove is not deep enough to keep hair ties in place.,47849,3
47849,"The bracelet is pretty though, and can be worn as a simple bangle.",47849,3
47850,Size of dress was not the same size as on the lable.,47850,3
47850,I can wear it but it is to tight fitting.,47850,3
47851,Too short for my MAC brushes.,47851,3
47851,Otherwise the design is really pretty.,47851,3
47852,I liked the shirt but not what I thought,47852,3
47853,The strap broke when I got it.,47853,3
47854,"These are slippery (however I do have silky hair and my caps are always slipping off even the cotton ones draw back a little) and even though the color and appearance is nice, I will return them.",47854,3
47855,Two strings on the underwear were ripped off,47855,3
47857,nothing  great but ok for the price,47857,3
47858,Finger attachment broke first night I wore it,47858,3
47859,Color/pattern is not as pictured and half of the top was not completely top stitched so it looks half finished.,47859,3
47859,It is still very pretty.,47859,3
47860,These are cute for wearing under a tank or something fashionable.,47860,3
47860,I ordered medium and I wear a 36C and there is no hold.,47860,3
47860,"If I ordered large, it may have been better.",47860,3
47860,"But super cute, they had some glitter on it.",47860,3
47861,"I don't know if i have a big head or what,,.but this beanie is small and doesn't slouch as advertised.......",47861,3
47862,"It a pretty nice tunic, just a little clingy.",47862,3
47862,"But will keep it anyway, but would't buy a similar one.",47862,3
47863,I feel like I sweated in these more than my standard pairs.,47863,3
47863,Okay but nothing special.,47863,3
47863,I might just not like synthetics.,47863,3
47864,button missing on one cuff,47864,3
47865,This jacket is very wrinkled when it arrives.,47865,3
47865,I'm not sure how to get all of the wrinkles out.,47865,3
47865,I've had it on a hanger for the past couple of weeks and even tried to gently steam it (with a professional clothes steamer) and it's still too wrinkled for my taste.,47865,3
47865,It's also a darker pink than it appears online.,47865,3
47866,"I ordered my normal size, executing to be able to wear it poof y the shoulder as pictured.",47866,3
47866,It's shorter than elected and smaller than expected.,47866,3
47866,The neckline is less of the shoulder more boat neck.,47866,3
47866,If you want to wear it asv pictured buy a size or two up.,47866,3
47866,"The cotton is really soft though, and it gotta perfectly acceptably.",47866,3
47866,It's just not as pictured.,47866,3
47867,As others have mentioned the scarf is long and wide but the quality is not very good but the price is a reflection of this.,47867,3
47867,The two scarfs I received were stitched terribly and I can't give them out as gifts due to this.,47867,3
47867,The stitching was separated and the string was hanging from the scarf on one of them.,47867,3
47867,They are soft to the touch and very light.,47867,3
47867,If the stitching was better and full square I would have rated it a five based on pricing.,47867,3
47867,The product came in ahead of schedule and the packaging was in a small packet from China.,47867,3
47867,I am disappointed in the product.,47867,3
47868,"Cute, but shrunk on the 1st wash.  :(",47868,3
47869,Beautiful and keeping it in my closet as a goal dress.,47869,3
47869,"It runs smaller than expected, so it didn't fit.",47869,3
47870,probably made by Chinese slaves that have never heard the Misfits...,47870,3
47872,It was nice  but it raped fast,47872,3
47873,it is okay but to small.,47873,3
47874,The dress was nice and quality seemed good but it just was not flattering on me (I'm just over 5' 8 with a slim/athletic build and usually wear a 2 or 4; ordered a medium which may have fit if I had a chest).,47874,3
47875,Looks great but needed to exchange bc it runs small.,47875,3
47875,Button accents also look they'll need reinforcing.,47875,3
47876,Ordered this shirt because the description says that it is 100% cotton.,47876,3
47876,"When I received it yesterday, on the shirt it says 60% cotton and 40% polyester.",47876,3
47877,Made with very delicate scarf material.,47877,3
47877,Very pretty but would not expect to be able to wear it very often.,47877,3
47877,Probably best to be worn one or twice for a special occasion.,47877,3
47877,But for the price I did not expect a lot more.,47877,3
47879,"Light weight denim, runs small.",47879,3
47880,This bracelet is ok for the cost.,47880,3
47880,It just doesn't look like the picture.,47880,3
47880,Very dull in color,47880,3
47881,"I like them but they are fitted so they are not as loose fitting as I would like but I will wear them, they are very pretty",47881,3
47882,It's not a bad item.,47882,3
47882,"However, it did not fit and this was after receiving the replacement as the first one I received the zipper would not unzip because of the stitching bunching up the material.",47882,3
47883,The beads are very nice but I ordered the smallest size and got one that was stretched out and so it doesn't fit.,47883,3
47883,The return is going to be a pain so I'm going to keep it and restring it myself.,47883,3
47884,This product is not designed for curvy women.,47884,3
47885,I purchased a size bigger and it fit.,47885,3
47885,One of the button wholes was sewn closed.,47885,3
47885,It wasn't the best quality.,47885,3
47887,Sleeved need to be cut off... they are a mile long.,47887,3
47887,Fits good but it's see through and cheap material.,47887,3
47887,I bought it for my bridal shower and ended up not wearing it.,47887,3
47887,Hope it finds a good home at good will.,47887,3
47888,"I love the grips on the feet--absolutely necessary for my 10 month old, as she's learning to walk.",47888,3
47888,"The cotton is not quite as soft as I'd hoped, but maybe with additional washes it'll get softer.",47888,3
47888,The grips on the feet are worth it.,47888,3
47889,Color was not as described.,47889,3
47889,I ordered an was expecting a light/powder blue color for a family event.,47889,3
47889,I didn't wear it but it is still a nice top that I know I will get use of..,47889,3
47890,I listened to the reviews and decided to go a half size bigger than I normally wear because everyone said they fit true to size but I wanted to play it safe and order one up.,47890,3
47890,I wear a size 9 usually but opted for 10s.,47890,3
47890,Would rather be a little too big than too small.,47890,3
47890,But they were TIGHT.,47890,3
47890,I could get them on but boy I had no room for my toes to move at all!,47890,3
47890,I wore them around and broke them in enough to wear them for one night (Halloween).,47890,3
47890,But I couldn't wear them for more than 4 hours probably without getting a foot cramp lol.,47890,3
47890,I loved the quality and shoes though!!!,47890,3
47890,So sad they were smaller than expected:(,47890,3
47891,"The bracelet is very cute, but after seeing it in person feel it should have been a little cheaper in cost.",47891,3
47892,Not what I expected,47892,3
47893,Ok for the price,47893,3
47894,loved the outfit but the blindfold was see thru,47894,3
47895,The color in this photo is not correct.,47895,3
47895,The finish I received is a patina brass color.,47895,3
47895,It is not shiny in the least and is dull in appearance.,47895,3
47895,"My daughter didn't mind and said she prefers the aged look, but it is certainly not what is shown in the picture.",47895,3
47896,"second time I've responded, was expecting a mans ring and this is a woman's ring.",47896,3
47897,little smaller than I expected.,47897,3
47897,i feel as though i'm constantly patting my pocket to make sure it's still there.,47897,3
47898,"NOT AS I EXPECTED TO BE, GREAT MATERIAL, BUT  TO BIG  IN MY SIZE",47898,3
47899,It was very cute and the fabric seemed nice.,47899,3
47899,However it is WAY TOO SMALL.,47899,3
47899,"I am 5' 125lbs, I ordered a small and could barely get it on.",47899,3
47899,I think I may actually need to order a large,47899,3
47900,Good width but would be better for somebody 6' +.,47900,3
47900,"Looks good, should wear well.",47900,3
47901,The sleeves are way too small.,47901,3
47901,The seller said I should expect a refund  and told me to just keep sweater and donate it.,47901,3
47901,Good idea and I did.,47901,3
47901,If your going to order one of these order 2 sizes bigger.,47901,3
47903,Really cute and fits true to size.,47903,3
47903,Was surprised that she shirt has small circle distressed patterns all over it.,47903,3
47903,It wasn't in the pics.,47903,3
47903,But really cute anyway.,47903,3
47904,It's very cute but not that well made,47904,3
47906,Very cute but very small.,47906,3
47906,Shirt was really short more like a bra and the shorts were very thin material that showed my butt cheeks.,47906,3
47906,"If anything I would give it 3 stars, I only made use of the shirt with high waisted jeans, definitely would buy this a size up.",47906,3
47907,Fits ok but looks somewhat cheap.,47907,3
47908,I ordered this in both deep blue and pink.,47908,3
47908,"I got the blue in medium, the pink in large.",47908,3
47908,By far the pink fit better.,47908,3
47908,"I'm 5'3"" and 130~ pounds, size 3-4 in pants, 36D.",47908,3
47908,The medium skirt won't even go over my butt!,47908,3
47908,"The large is fine, still snug and short though.",47908,3
47908,Ditch the semi-sheer skirts and match the tops with a different skirt.,47908,3
47908,"It all depends on your frame, but the tops are super stretchy and the bow can be pinned or sewed on.",47908,3
47908,As a medium I probably would've been better off getting an XL.,47908,3
47908,Size up two sizes if you're unsure,47908,3
47909,I usually wear a 10-12 and this size large is too small,47909,3
47910,"look really cheap and break easily, I was already throwing them away a week after purchased.",47910,3
47911,I only wore it once.,47911,3
47912,Ok lie the other better thought I had canclled order!,47912,3
47913,Cute for a girl.,47913,3
47914,"I am 5'3"" and 135 lbs.",47914,3
47914,I ordered the medium because I read these run small and it fits perfectly.,47914,3
47914,I have washed and worn this hoodie over and over and it hasn't shrunk much at all and I get a lot of compliments.,47914,3
47914,Very fun to wear.,47914,3
47916,"Cheap, turns ankle green",47916,3
47917,"Its a cute shirt but it fits a lot smaller then I was hoping, so definitely order a larger size if you want it to fit loosely.",47917,3
47917,"It fits me tightly, unlike the picture portrays it should.",47917,3
47918,"Serves purpose well, good buy for prirce",47918,3
47920,"I loved the print (turquoise blue roses, beige background).",47920,3
47920,The problem was the fabric.,47920,3
47920,"Unlike other pencil skirts I've purchased, this material is thinner.",47920,3
47920,"I bought a size small (I'm 5'4 120lbs) and it fit, but you could see through the fabric.",47920,3
47920,"Other skirts hug and stretch, but don't show your undies.",47920,3
47920,This fabric showed your stuff.,47920,3
47920,"BUT, I loved the pattern so much that I returned it and bought a larger size and the large size doesn't stretch, just hangs off my hips and it isn't see through.",47920,3
47920,"The disadvantage of that is it's a different look, more like a maxi skirt than a pencil skirt wearing it two sizes too big.",47920,3
47920,The darker colors are probably a safer bet.,47920,3
47921,It broke after wearing it for a couple hours.,47921,3
47923,smallish side of fit,47923,3
47924,"The material of the shirt is nice, and the fit was as expected but on big problem is the color of the shirt is way off!!!!",47924,3
47924,I wanted the nice mellow yellow colored sunflower but instead I got a really bright orange sun flower shirt .,47924,3
47924,"I guess for a third of the price ,u get what u get",47924,3
47925,We sent exact measurements via email per dressy tailors request and received a gorgeous dress on time that needed to be altered because it was too big.,47925,3
47925,The dress has hundreds of beads so having it altered was a chore.,47925,3
47925,They had to remove and then hand sew each bead on.,47925,3
47925,This took hours and of course that turned into $$.,47925,3
47925,The dress ended up costing twice as much because of alterations.,47925,3
47925,The dress is a very high quality gown and was definately worth the $$.,47925,3
47925,Just wish they had made it to the specifications we sent as per thier request.,47925,3
47926,Bought these shades to see how well the classic design would fare on my head before investing in a pair of Ray-Ban Clubmasters.,47926,3
47926,I fell in love with these the moment I took them out of the package.,47926,3
47926,"The glasses themselves looked amazing and felt durable, despite the completely plastic body (maybe even the ""glass"" itself).",47926,3
47926,"Over the weeks, the frames began getting extremely flimsy and the ""glass"" or whatever it may be, got covered in scratches.",47926,3
47926,"There is no UV protection whatsoever, so these will do a number on your vision after extended wear.",47926,3
47926,"If you're a person that hates to be called out on, do NOT buy these, as everybody that sees these will call them fake.. or my personal favorite; ""swap meet Ray-Bans"".",47926,3
47926,"If you only care about looks, these are the sunglasses for you.",47926,3
47926,"If durability, feel, (and branding) is important to you, save the $10 for a pair of Ray-Bans...you won't regret it.",47926,3
47927,Very soft but I would order a size up,47927,3
47928,This was not what I expected-and I am not sure why.,47928,3
47928,The colors are vibrant.,47928,3
47928,The wrist bracelet feels ok (could not wear 24/7) the necklace is beautiful but just a tad too long and the ankle bracelet was lacking in stones.,47928,3
47928,"The advertisement is correct, but after I opened it I wasn't overly excited like I was when I purchased it.",47928,3
47928,I think this is that jewlery that you put away and wear with a specific outfit as opposed to everyday wear.,47928,3
47929,I'm in different I was under the assumption that they were sending me a shorts sleeve shirt but I got long sleeves.,47929,3
47929,I got a medium purple it's fits nicely just a little big.,47929,3
47930,I liked the look of the pants but they were too big around the waist and if you were climbing i think they would slide down at the back.,47930,3
47932,I had to keep pulling them up all night around my thigh.,47932,3
47932,Thick thighs would love these.,47932,3
47932,Arch support was terrible!,47932,3
47932,My knees began to buckle around the 3rd hour of dancing.,47932,3
47932,They are sexy though.,47932,3
47933,Too big for US Currency,47933,3
47934,Pretty but a little flimsy and I had difficulty closing it.,47934,3
47935,"doesn't look anything like the picture, but you get what you pay for I suppose.",47935,3
47935,"Still a good wig, the pink is a lot brighter than pictured and the blonde isn't as long.",47935,3
47936,This fits like a shirt and not a dress,47936,3
47937,Just ok. Not what I expected.,47937,3
47938,I'm normally a size 3/4 female.,47938,3
47938,Ran small in some areas and longer arms.,47938,3
47939,The color and size of this wallet were great!,47939,3
47939,"However, the leather felt a little thin, there were a few stains, and the zipper was very difficult use.",47939,3
47939,"For these reasons, I ended up sending it back for another D&B.",47939,3
47940,"I wish the stud fit more snugly to my earlobe, they droop a lil.",47940,3
47941,"I really liked them, and they fit perfectly.",47941,3
47941,Only thing I don't like about them is that the black is getting scratch off from just wearing them a couple days.,47941,3
47942,"Lovely color and fit, but while I thought a regular length would be ok for me, at 5'4"" and size 16 these dragged on the ground, and the boot cut seemed very wide.",47942,3
47942,"I ordered another pair of PajamaJeans in the petite size/skinny, and the length and fit were both perfect.",47942,3
47943,They arrived as promised.,47943,3
47943,They are half the weight of our old ones and easy to pack with large pockets on the front which makes organizing easy.,47943,3
47943,I would have given them 5 stars but on our first trip with this set the seams on the middle case pulled apart.,47943,3
47944,"Cute, but too thin.",47944,3
47944,Would only wear as pjs or hang around the house clothes.,47944,3
47944,"My daughter loves fish, so that part is a big hit.",47944,3
47944,"The hat is just a throw away for us - when it's hot enough to wear this, you wouldn't try to put a hat like that on your toddler's head.",47944,3
47945,I'm 5'8 and usually wear a medium in dresses.,47945,3
47945,I ordered a large because I didn't want the dress to be too short.,47945,3
47945,I should have ordered an XL.,47945,3
47945,I can't even bend over without my butt showing.,47945,3
47948,It was too small.,47948,3
47948,It did not have a tag of any kind in it or on it.,47948,3
47948,I gave it to my 33 yr old daughter and she looked very stylish in it.,47948,3
47948,So it all worked out.,47948,3
47949,A little too tight in the shoulders.,47949,3
47949,I tried on a large and I was swimming in it.,47949,3
47949,So there doesn't appear to be a happy medium in this brand for me.,47949,3
47950,Lasted about a week then it rained and the cord snapped like a tooth pick,47950,3
47951,"Very thin, arms a little short, but hey, it's a costume.",47951,3
47951,Cuffs and bottom are not knit.,47951,3
47952,Very long and way too large on the top.,47952,3
47953,"It runs small, but I got a lot of complements wearing it.",47953,3
47953,"I almost returned it, but I needed something to cover my pencil dress because it was too skin tight.",47953,3
47953,Luckily I had the skirt in my bag and threw it over my dress.,47953,3
47953,I wore it around my mid section with a belt.,47953,3
47953,Order a second one because I ended up loving the first one.,47953,3
47953,The white and purple .... the fabric is different from the black and purple.,47953,3
47953,The second one size is also different too..,47953,3
47955,This is not a full circle skirt.,47955,3
47955,"I noticed the title says ""full circle A line"" but the details section says ""full circle""- a full circle would look like a half circle when held out to your sides.",47955,3
47955,"The fabric was nice- a little stiff and would need to be ironed but it was a nice weight and had a little stretch to the skirt (not the waist, though).",47955,3
47955,I have a 28.5/29 inch waist and the medium fit me well.,47955,3
47955,"However, I wanted a circle skirt so this is being returned.",47955,3
47955,Thankfully I caught it while it was Prime.,47955,3
47956,"I understand you get random items, but I got 3 ducks, 1 lion and 1 lamb.",47956,3
47956,It would be nice if you got 5 different designs.,47956,3
47956,The undies are well made and soft...not a big fan of ducks or lions!,47956,3
47957,"Pretty uncomfortable, the plastic is hard and unyielding so when it's on your head it feels as though your temples are being squeezed.",47957,3
47958,Yoga smaller than I would like,47958,3
47959,The chart indicated the suit should fit me...and for the most part it did.,47959,3
47959,The bra section with the thick foam pads alis too tight.,47959,3
47959,"I noticed someone had the same problem, and removed the pads.",47959,3
47959,I am going to try that.,47959,3
47960,I really like the material and the cut of the top but the way the mid section is cut is very unflattering.,47960,3
47960,I wasn't wanting it to be fitted but the way the seams for the top of the skirt are placed adds bulk that isn't good.,47960,3
47960,It also shrunk after 1st washing and hang dry.,47960,3
47961,Fades after first wash.,47961,3
47962,I usually wear a 'large' size but ordered extra large just for insurance.,47962,3
47962,The extra large came and is smaller than a regular large.,47962,3
47962,These were for a trip so I'm disappointed.,47962,3
47963,Snaps on strap were very flimsy kept popping open.,47963,3
47964,"Color is much brighter than pictured, almost neon yellow.",47964,3
47965,I order M size received a L size and still was small.,47965,3
47966,The head hole is small and there was makeup on the shirt when I unpackaged it.,47966,3
47967,"Like other reviewers have said, this garment does not hold anything in.",47967,3
47967,It will only give you a seamless appearance under form-fitting dresses.,47967,3
47967,You will need to wear a girdle underneath this body shaper in order to hold in the stomach and hips.,47967,3
47968,"so cute, but small and see through, and waistband twists a lot.",47968,3
47968,"Normally wear med, order xl and it works",47968,3
47969,"Sharp coat, looked well made....If you have longer arms or an athletic build, you will definitely need a Long...sleeves run a little short.",47969,3
47970,Scratched on but no time to return it since it was a gift.,47970,3
47970,I am going to see about engraving something on it to cover the scratch which means I will be spending more money on this gift than anticipated.,47970,3
47972,"Not scratch proof as tungsten would be, but it doesn't seem to want to shatter, as is common with tungsten, so I don't think it is tungsten.",47972,3
47974,This bag is very large...so if you have a lot of equipment this os perfect.,47974,3
47974,"If not, do not buy it.",47974,3
47975,"After washing, sleeves shrank and now fit oddly.",47975,3
47975,"The materials is cotton and not stretchy, so it's not a very flattering fit.",47975,3
47976,The shirt is pretty much as described however it runs fairly small.,47976,3
47976,I got a medium for my daughter who is only 5' 8 and 120 pounds and it barely fits.,47976,3
47976,This is not a stretchy tank.,47976,3
47977,Should Of Ordered A Smaller Size.,47977,3
47978,"yes i know they were cheap, but i wasn't expecting them to be ""that cheap"".. most of the plastic balls were stripped, or are very easily stripped.",47978,3
47978,i bought these as i need A pair for when i had a surgery (no metal jewelry allowed),47978,3
47979,These are likely the most comfortable pair of pants I've ever put on.,47979,3
47979,"They are very very thin, see through, and I am what you would call ""extra"" so every little bump and dimple shows through.",47979,3
47979,"If you are thin, trim and fit, you will love this pant.",47979,3
47979,"If your body is any less than ideal, move on.",47979,3
47980,Doesn't fit as I expected plus I don't like the color.,47980,3
47980,"I gave it away, though.",47980,3
47981,"This binder will def hold you in, but you can see it under your clothes.",47981,3
47981,It is also very uncomfortable so I could only wear it for short periods of time.,47981,3
47982,Runs a bit small.,47982,3
47982,"Material is good
Shipping was great",47982,3
47983,"The material is great, as is the design.",47983,3
47983,The length was way to short.,47983,3
47983,This item is a nice shirt.,47983,3
47983,I wear a large i purchased a xxl.,47983,3
47984,"Love the way the dress looks, but unfortunately it's very hard to get zipped when on.",47984,3
47984,Even with my husbands help it the zipper still gets easily zipped.,47984,3
47984,I have to zip it part way up before putting it on to get it zipped up without gettin stuck.,47984,3
47985,Shipped pretty quickly which was great but I literally lost this the same day I got it.,47985,3
47985,It kept slipping from my nose so that really sucked.,47985,3
47985,But it was definitely cute.,47985,3
47985,The only reason why I'm not too pissed about losing it because I ordered other clip ons from Forever 21.,47985,3
47986,These things are minute.,47986,3
47986,My fault for not reading the dimensions.,47986,3
47986,They will fit on the upper part of your ear if you are lucky.,47986,3
47986,They don't stay on for me.,47986,3
47986,They're lovely to look at... with a magnifying glass.,47986,3
47986,They seem well made.,47986,3
47986,"Seriously, if you have worn cuffs near the top of your ear before and they work for you I recommend these.",47986,3
47986,"If not, stick to the normal-sized ones that fit lower on your ear, and always read the dimensions before ordering.",47986,3
47987,"cute but too small will be returning, also the material is a bit thin for my liking",47987,3
47988,"I have to say that xl is not a 10 size, is much larger.",47988,3
47988,The design is weird and does not flatter your figure at all if you are fit.,47988,3
47988,Also i found the material stiff and wrinkled.,47988,3
47988,I am giving 3 stars being soooo generous but i will give it away.,47988,3
47988,Dont want it over me.,47988,3
47989,I will exchange for a smaller size.,47989,3
47990,We had to return this dress because it was too large in the bodice.,47990,3
47990,My daughter has a long torso and it also fit to short up at the top.,47990,3
47991,These P. Michael shirts are made 2-3 sizes smaller than what they are stated to be.,47991,3
47991,I even purchased the largest size available and it still is too snug..,47991,3
47992,"NOT shorts, they are definitely ""panties""!",47992,3
47993,It will definitely get the job done and will cover your neck if you need it.,47993,3
47993,"It looks VERY odd if you roll it up, though.",47993,3
47993,It just didn't look right and was bunched up looking.,47993,3
47993,"I have a not-so-great photo of my hat, but you see what I mean.",47993,3
47995,This dress us much prettier in the pictured than in person.,47995,3
47995,It actually looks like a nightie when you put it on.,47995,3
47995,"To be fair, I probably ordered a size too big but I based it on other reviews.",47995,3
47995,The material feels heavy as well for a sundress.,47995,3
47996,I would give it a five star rating if it had pockets.,47996,3
47997,"Like wearing a tent, which can is fine if you're into that sort of thing",47997,3
47998,"One broke the first day I wore it, but that's expected for the price.",47998,3
47998,You get what you pay for and I'm okay with that.,47998,3
47999,"It was described as ""loose fit"" so I expected a relaxed fir but it's actually very baggy",47999,3
48000,This sweater looks nothing like the posted picture(colors different) and looks and fits at waist more like a cardigan than the longer sweater shown.,48000,3
48001,The XL was too small...it was like a small to medium size.,48001,3
48001,The blouse itself is very nice...good quality fabric.,48001,3
48001,I gave them away as gifts whom is a small size & she loved them.,48001,3
48001,I would not order them again.,48001,3
48002,Looks to fake for me.,48002,3
48004,The quality seem great.,48004,3
48004,"However,
I order size small.",48004,3
48004,But size medium was delivered,48004,3
48005,They look exactly as they appear online.,48005,3
48005,"However, they started to turn after a few weeks.",48005,3
48007,Elastic is a little tight around the tummy.,48007,3
48008,These are just okay.,48008,3
48008,They do fit as expected but the material is thin and not very flattering.,48008,3
48008,"Also the Art Deco print looked cool online but I don't love
It on in person",48008,3
48009,This has a weird fit for me.,48009,3
48009,"I am a size 8/medium and it does fit, but it is shorter and wider than my figure and the sleeves are significantly shorter so I have to role them up to 3/4 to make it look fine.",48009,3
48009,I wear it open to avoid the awkwardness of the shape on my body when buttoned.,48009,3
48009,This is not a good option for slender figures looking for something fitted but will work if keeping unbuttoned.,48009,3
48010,It was perfect except for the belt buckle coming undone unexpectedly because it wasn't secure.,48010,3
48011,"Unless you're comfortable with major side boob, big breasts women probably wouldn't like it.",48011,3
48011,The bottom half fit good though.,48011,3
48012,These are exactly what you have seen in Walmart many times...made in China...you know the drill.,48012,3
48012,The only thing I was thinking when I wore them was the padding on the bottom is rather thin and I think if worn outside would not last long.,48012,3
48012,I only wore them twice yesterday...then discovered one of my dogs pee'd on them....so they are now headed to the washer...hope they survive.,48012,3
48013,"Do not like the fabric and was too small, returned...but customer service was very helpful, would order from this company again.",48013,3
48013,"If you have larger breasts I would go up a size, maybe that would help with the fit...",48013,3
48014,After a few washes it became very stringy (the cheap fabric that is almost like thin plastic snags on everything),48014,3
48016,"Doesn't really look like picture, but I still like them.",48016,3
48018,"Not the material I expected, but nice shirt to wear with jeans",48018,3
48019,Fun and looks good.,48019,3
48020,Very tight on the legs but loose on the waist.,48020,3
48022,I measured and could tell it was too big right away.,48022,3
48022,Had to trade in for a small so 3 stars for inconvenience.,48022,3
48022,Quality is nice though,48022,3
48023,"This is a very cute top, but is much shorter than it appears.",48023,3
48023,"I'm 5'10"" and this is much too short to be considered a dress.",48023,3
48023,It's still a very cute top and looks good with shorts.,48023,3
48024,Didn't really fit right,48024,3
48025,"I thought it would drape as in the picture, but on me it fits snug.",48025,3
48026,Problems with the way it's put together.,48026,3
48028,Great look and color frames but they are very fragile glasses.,48028,3
48028,I'm on my second pair.,48028,3
48028,It's obviously all about looks not durability.,48028,3
48029,I like the soft feel.,48029,3
48029,Felt really good against my penis.,48029,3
48029,But the pouch for the testicles was WAY to small and low.,48029,3
48029,I had to stretch the pouch and that way only one testicles would fit.,48029,3
48029,The sleeve for the Penis was small and long but easily stretches to accommodates girth of a fully erect penis.,48029,3
48029,The underwater it self looked like it was designed for a pencil dick.,48029,3
48029,Not designed for someone with a average or above average size penis.,48029,3
48029,However because materials made of spandex it does stretch to accommodate the needs of most sizes.,48029,3
48029,Despite odd positions of testicle pouch as well as the legs riding up they seem to feel fine.,48029,3
48029,Next time I will order another pair a size smaller that are not boxer briefs.,48029,3
48030,This is way too small.,48030,3
48030,It is cute but the sizing is definitely off.,48030,3
48031,"The zipper is rough to pull up even when the dress is off, small stain on the front, but not too noticeable luckily.",48031,3
48032,"It didn't take that long, but it was small.. Like an extra small and the material could have been better.",48032,3
48033,"For the material & the fact that this is a two pack, it is really well priced.",48033,3
48033,"BUT they aren't nearly as stretchy as you'd expect leggings to be, hence their use of the word ""tights"".",48033,3
48033,So definitely order a size up.,48033,3
48033,"I'll probably keep them, but still not the best product out there.",48033,3
48034,"The red color on the pics is actually brown
2.",48034,3
48034,"It's too short, looks longer in the pics.",48034,3
48034,I bought size S and it's wide but little too short.,48034,3
48035,"I wanted to love this dress - super cute, length was perfect and it fit great except for the top area.",48035,3
48035,"It was really large and although I'm not humongus up top, I'm also not tiny.",48035,3
48035,I'm about average and would have had to pin and/or sew this to fit comfortably and to be flattering at top.,48035,3
48035,"Had a Great Gatsby themed wedding a few days following the order and if more time i may have kept the dress and altered it or replaced it with a size smaller, but did not have the time to ship back and forth or alter myself and fortunately found another dress that I loved just as much which fit perfectly without alteration.",48035,3
48035,This is the only picture I took & after I pinned the extra material together on the back in order to see how it would look if it actually fit me .,48035,3
48035,It was a good two inches loose on either side.,48035,3
48035,Way too large to be worn without pinning/fixing.,48035,3
48036,I was very excited to receive this.,48036,3
48036,I bought one for me and two for gifts.,48036,3
48036,My boyfriend and I opened one up together tonight.,48036,3
48036,The box was very lovely and put together.,48036,3
48036,From first appearances I'd say this was packaged very well.,48036,3
48036,I took the oyster can and necklace cage out.,48036,3
48036,I examined the cage and it was better quality than I expected for the price.,48036,3
48036,I then proceeded to open the can with the oyster.,48036,3
48036,This was so much fun for me.,48036,3
48036,I then used the provided plastic to open the shell.,48036,3
48036,It was a little tough to start but worked and popped open.,48036,3
48036,I felt around with the little tool and the pearl popped right out.,48036,3
48036,When I got the pearl out I wiped it off with a soft cloth and noticed it was not shiny.,48036,3
48036,It was very dull and had crust on it.,48036,3
48036,I tried to gently remove the crust but it would not come off.,48036,3
48036,I was disappointed because this pearl is not one I'd ever wear.,48036,3
48036,I would have rated this all 5 stars if it had a shiny pearl.,48036,3
48036,"I do give it 3 stars as it was a fun experience, the packaging was nice and the necklace was better than expected.",48036,3
48036,I don't expect that all pearls are like mine.,48036,3
48036,I just happened to get a bad one.,48036,3
48036,"It looked a lot like other fresh water pearls I've seen, as it was egg shaped (to be expected).",48036,3
48037,Like the pants but if u have a big booty or thighs go a size up.,48037,3
48039,The print is much darker with a lot less detail than the picture but it's not horrible.,48039,3
48040,It would have been very helpful if directions were attached.,48040,3
48041,"Cute, but definitely order a size up, especially if you're going to be wearing anything under this other than a tank top.",48041,3
48041,Sleeves are very tight.,48041,3
48042,"I love the dress, but it is a little big in the chest area.",48042,3
48042,Or I am not as endowed as I like to think haha,48042,3
48043,"It's cute, but runs really small.",48043,3
48044,The outfit is adorable and does not look cheap at all.,48044,3
48044,The lace is beautiful.,48044,3
48044,It arrived within a week.,48044,3
48044,However the size 18-24 months was so big it fit my average sized 5 year old daughter.,48044,3
48044,I didn't want to return it so i kept it for my older daughter instead to use as a cute top with different bottoms.,48044,3
48044,Just beware of sizing.,48044,3
48045,"I expected more ""slouch.""",48045,3
48045,It fits more like a beret type hat.,48045,3
48047,"The eye glasses are great, the case is terrible.",48047,3
48047,I took my original case off and put the new one on drop my phone and it shattered.,48047,3
48047,"My original cover was much thicker and as many times as I have dropped it before, nothing ever happened.",48047,3
48047,So the whole thing cost me an extra $130 to fix my shattered glass,48047,3
48048,Hard to lace up in the back.,48048,3
48049,The rhinestone gets caught on everything known to man and god.,48049,3
48049,Besides that the metal quality is very nice but it could have been a bit bigger.,48049,3
48049,The ring itself is a bit on the small side if you decide to use it as a lip ring.,48049,3
48050,Expected a better quality for the high price.,48050,3
48051,Purchased for a wedding and they worked just fine.,48051,3
48051,"A few fibers/threads were visible on the seams, and the material is cheap, but for purposes of wearing them just a few times, they worked well.",48051,3
48052,great quality but too small for me.,48052,3
48052,I usually wear US medium but this is tight on the waist and sleeves.,48052,3
48052,I have to donate it since it can't be shipped back.,48052,3
48053,"Stars for super fast shipping, nice looking lingerie, but somehow small.",48053,3
48053,Even tho I was choosing by the measurement provided by seller.,48053,3
48053,"Nice lace, very delicate and soft fabric, just for sexy look.",48053,3
48053,Pity its a little small.,48053,3
48054,"These are really cute, but they cut into my baby's neck.",48054,3
48054,They probably work better for bigger kids/toddlers,48054,3
48055,This shirt is not white like in the picture.,48055,3
48055,Its more of a cream color with a blue tint to it.,48055,3
48055,Not really what I expected.,48055,3
48056,size chart def off a lil bit...,48056,3
48058,"I ordered 3, in different colors, but now I wish I had gotten one just to see.",48058,3
48058,I'm not wearing this religiously but am having trouble wrapping it around for the look I wanted so I would expect problems wearing it in a way that some faiths mandate.,48058,3
48059,"So disappointed, it was the perfect size, color, & shape....but it had burn marks on it.",48059,3
48059,Now they r outta stock.,48059,3
48060,These pants were extremely comfortable and fit well around the waist.,48060,3
48060,Unfortunately they were much too long.,48060,3
48060,Was sad to send them back.,48060,3
48061,I ordered a large and it's too small.,48061,3
48062,The Pendant is beautiful but I was disappointed when I took the necklace out the chain broke too easily.,48062,3
48062,I kept the pendant hoping that Jiayiqi would replace the chain.,48062,3
48062,Packaging and shipping were fine,48062,3
48063,"These are cute, have nice pockets, and the belly band fits great.",48063,3
48063,"My only complaint is that after wearing them for a while, the stitching that circles around the thigh to create that pattern (see the stock photo) started to rub and irritate my skin too much.",48063,3
48063,I feel like it wasn't worth the look they were going for - who wants to be irritated while preggers?,48063,3
48064,"First thing after I got these bandanas, I hand washed them.",48064,3
48064,I realized that most of them were bleeding color especially the dark ones.,48064,3
48064,"After a couple of washes, I managed to get that new-papery feel out of it.",48064,3
48064,But one thing I noticed is some of the dark colored ones felt kinda slimy/slippery while I washing it.,48064,3
48064,"I'm not sure why this happened only for those colors (black and blue), but after I dried it off it was back to normal.",48064,3
48064,Let me know if any of you guys feel the same.,48064,3
48064,"Anyways, I used them rigorously for my backpacking trip.",48064,3
48064,"I carried 2 of them and used one as a headband, cover my face and neck in misty/chilly weather and as a scarf.",48064,3
48064,"The other one I used as sweat/dirt wipe, wash cloth etc.",48064,3
48064,Very very handy and looks good too!,48064,3
48064,Would've definitely given 5 stars if it wasn't for the weird soapy feeling of the dark shades!,48064,3
48065,When it arrived I was quite excited but when I took it out of the package the ring was flattened.,48065,3
48065,Although I was able to open it back up It does not fit well and it could be just me but it looks more vibrant in the picture.,48065,3
48065,"I am a little disappointed with the craftsmanship, I do not believe it will hold up for long but I will wear it for as long as it last.",48065,3
48066,I loved the design of this shirt with the cat giving the middle finger when the pocket is pulled down.,48066,3
48066,"However, this shirt runs small and isn't the best quality.",48066,3
48066,"Once I washed it, it became to small for me unless I lose some weight.",48066,3
48066,"Too bad, it's a funny shirt.",48066,3
48066,Would have liked to wear it more than once.,48066,3
48067,"cute, but large and impossible to see out nose holes for twelve year old.",48067,3
48067,"As an adult, I too could not see well enough to feel safe wearing this",48067,3
48068,"the product was good quality, but this is not sizing for USA, i purshased anXXL and its was more of a size medium",48068,3
48069,Ordered the grey toe and heel comfort crew.,48069,3
48069,Got the grey bottom.,48069,3
48069,Little small for my size 16.,48069,3
48069,Also thinner than I'm used to.,48069,3
48069,Feels like they won't last as long.,48069,3
48069,Guess I'll keep shopping at Walmart.,48069,3
48070,"I love the shirt, but had to return it, as medium fits REALLY small.",48070,3
48070,"Since I don't know how to size, will have to pass.",48070,3
48071,I was so excited when these first arrived.,48071,3
48071,THey were thicker than I had expected and looked really nice.,48071,3
48071,"Unfortunately, the string came off the mitten the very first time my daughter wore a pair.",48071,3
48072,Cute but cheaply made.,48072,3
48073,Nice material but not as dressy as it looks in the picture.,48073,3
48075,I bought these a size larger because I figured they would shrink a size.,48075,3
48075,They did shrink a size and so they fit me but each time I wash and dry them they get smaller.,48075,3
48075,So if you like them don't put them in the dryer!!,48075,3
48077,Material sucks and not waterproof.,48077,3
48077,"However, it shipped incredibly fast and is super cheap compared to other brands.",48077,3
48079,Nice but it don't stretch much,48079,3
48080,"Very nice skirt, however zipper did not work!",48080,3
48081,product did not have silver lining at top.,48081,3
48081,it was just all black,48081,3
48082,i bought a 14 in another dress and it was smaller then this dress.,48082,3
48083,It seems like good quality.,48083,3
48083,It's warm fleece fabric...this may have been in the description but I don't recall it.,48083,3
48083,It's probably too warm for me to wear in Oct in TX.,48083,3
48083,"The Batman decoration is a type of material that would melt if I ironed it, and the decal is very wrinkly looking.",48083,3
48083,Its a fine costume.,48083,3
48084,"I ordered too large a size thinking it would run small but apparently it fits true to size, I still love it tho",48084,3
48085,The quality is great - Thick and warm pants but the sweatpants shrank a lot in the wash and the vest was large-didn't shrink.,48085,3
48085,The colors on the pant vs the striping on the shirt are off.,48085,3
48085,"I just don't put him in the ensemble - The shirt and vest are worn with jeans and the sweatpants just don't fit - unless you like the style of ""skinny"" sweats on a toddler.",48085,3
48086,"Cute, but the cups are very small and padded.",48086,3
48086,"I bought XL, I wear a size 12 and 36D.",48086,3
48086,I would love it if the cups weren't what feels like a B.,48086,3
48087,Originally ordered a large (her normal size) for my niece and it was way too small.,48087,3
48087,Ordered 2XL and it fits great.,48087,3
48088,"The item was pretty inexpensive...and it reflects just that...on the captains hat, the emblem was sewed on crooked!!",48088,3
48089,"Very sheer, also waist & top are not the same as in pic.",48089,3
48089,It's close but when you are paying for something you expect to get what is shown in advertisement.,48089,3
48090,Dress is amazing only thing it's Rose gold and not gold,48090,3
48091,Couldn't find any thick terry shorts - these ones are not nearly as sturdy and well made as the ones I was trying to replace for my husband.,48091,3
48091,They will do for by the pool or lake but wish I could find the heavier weight ones :(,48091,3
48092,"The style is very cool but it felt like I was wearing blue jeans, which feels uncomfortable when you come out of the water.. it took forever to dry out, if you like a swimsuit that dries out then I don't think you'd like these, plus the material was super thick.",48092,3
48093,"I'll preface this review by stating that I am 6' 2"" and weigh 200lbs so depending on your dimensions your mileage may vary.",48093,3
48093,"That said for us tall gentlemen who are used to mostly having to buy larges, and occasionally mediums the sizing on this coat is confusing.",48093,3
48093,"For reading the description and reviews I was led to believe a medium would be a good fit, but it turned out to be much too large for my body.",48093,3
48093,"I believe I am going to order the Slim Fit version in a small, that's how oversized the jacket was.",48093,3
48093,"That said the materials seemed very durable and well made, I was disappointed that I couldn't wear it since it seemed like a good jacket.",48093,3
48094,I really like the wristlet/crossbody but this is my second one.,48094,3
48094,The first one I returned because the inside zipper broke.,48094,3
48094,"The second one, that I have right now, the outside zipper is now broke an I am unable to return it.",48094,3
48094,"I bought it in August 2016 & apparently my ""window to return"" cosed in September 2016.",48094,3
48095,i really like it for the price but too large which I should have known being it's only one size,48095,3
48096,I had to send it back and get a different size.,48096,3
48098,"This  has nice bling on it, is subtle, and is light weight.",48098,3
48098,"However the arm holes are baggy at the front, and is not the quality I have found in all the other tops I've bought from Jostar.",48098,3
48098,"If you normally take a Med, as I do, order a Large.",48098,3
48099,I purchased this box to hold all the elements of a jewelry testing kit that I purchased on Amazon.,48099,3
48099,"The box is large enough for the bottles, but not the files, scale, etc.",48099,3
48099,I would have preferred a more contained kit since my primary use is when I'm hunting garage sales and stuff tends to float around the car if not nicely contained.,48099,3
48099,I ended up putting this wooden box inside a larger (shoebox sized) plastic tote so that everything was together and portable.,48099,3
48100,I can normally wear.a size 12 or a large.,48100,3
48100,This blouse fits more like a size 8.,48100,3
48101,"It's comfortable, looks good with other bracelets on my arm....until the hairband falls off the bracelet.",48101,3
48101,The sulcus isn't deep enough to hold the band in place all day as the bracelet slides up and down your arm.,48101,3
48101,"So concept, fantastic...execution, could easily be improved by making the edges higher.",48101,3
48102,"I was unable to locate in a smaller size though, so I am hoping that it will shrink after washing and drying.",48102,3
48102,"It's 97% cotton, so it should shrink a little bit.",48102,3
48102,the drawstring doesn't help at all.,48102,3
48103,I am still trying to warm up to this.,48103,3
48103,"I like the fit (I am a med, ordered a large).",48103,3
48103,I started wearing it 1 hour a day.,48103,3
48103,Then moved to 2 hours.,48103,3
48103,I can't get past the 2 hour mark.,48103,3
48103,It gets very uncomfortable for me and I have to take it off.,48103,3
48103,"I Guess I should power through it, but I don't feel like it (lol).",48103,3
48103,It does give you a nice shape if you wear it under clothing (Makes your butt pop out and your breasts sit up and out).,48103,3
48103,I just don't like to wear it that long.,48103,3
48103,I will keep trying to work my way into wearing this longer.,48103,3
48103,All you women out there that go 8+ hours in this or any trainer...You all are Rock Stars in my book!,48103,3
48104,These pants will do the job but I won't order them again.,48104,3
48104,They are very thin which I expected from the other reviews.,48104,3
48104,I thought they'd fit me well as I am a small but with a rather large bottom.,48104,3
48104,They are a little bit big in the thigh area even though I ordered a small.,48104,3
48105,I like it ..is just not the same fabric ..i got a hard different then what it shows on the pictura..but size os good ..still like it,48105,3
48106,I love the fabric.,48106,3
48106,I love the fit of the legs.,48106,3
48106,But the waist is soooooo tight.,48106,3
48106,"I normally wear a medium, I got these in a large and they were still uncomfortably tight.",48106,3
48106,"I thought about keeping them since I can't order them bigger, but it was just not good.",48106,3
48107,Attractive but not comfortable and do not have spring hinges.,48107,3
48107,Bought them for Halloween.,48107,3
48108,I love the bottom there nice and bright but the top if not as bright as the picture I brought the bathing suit knowing that but I really just wanted the bottoms the top runs small and I don't like that you have to tie it in the back that's not a good idea for a plus size bathing suit.,48108,3
48108,So if you get this just know it doesn't cover much in the back,48108,3
48109,Fits smaller than the size says so you can't carry much in the pockets (CC).,48109,3
48109,Other than that it's a comfortable jacket and can be wore in any weather,48109,3
48110,The charm is great but the necklace broke with a very small tug!,48110,3
48110,I was anle to fix it but next time I hope my necklace is a lot stronger...,48110,3
48111,The item fits as expected.,48111,3
48111,I am usually a US medium so I bought an XL knowing how the size varies.,48111,3
48111,The material is thin though.,48111,3
48112,it was nice looking blouse but the line finishing wasn't that clean so that problem made this blouse cheap.,48112,3
48113,This would have gotten more stars if it weren't that when I bought it I didn't know what size I am and guessed which didn't work out so well.,48113,3
48113,But gave it to my brother because it wouldn't fit.,48113,3
48114,I have a small nose so the stem is a little too long and I'd like the jewel to be bigger.,48114,3
48114,But for the price and amount can't complain.,48114,3
48114,Pretty good quality given the price too.,48114,3
48114,A good back up stash to have when you lose your favorite nose ring and need something in to replace it.,48114,3
48115,Just received it and tried on so this is a first impression review.,48115,3
48115,I purchased this for a masquerade birthday party later this month.,48115,3
48115,"First impression is like another reviewer said, it fits weird around the eyes.",48115,3
48115,Not sure if its cause I have long lases or what but it touches my lower lid and lashes.,48115,3
48115,"Also, looking down is not comfortable and it obstructs sight while doing so.",48115,3
48115,I'm thinking I may need to use lash glue or something to keep it in place the night of the party.,48115,3
48115,"It actually feels more comfortable worn upside down, but then it pushes down my nose tip and is ultimately upside down.",48115,3
48115,I will keep it since I'm running low on time and may embellish it a bit.,48115,3
48115,The cat ears (with a gold metal headband-not shown in picture or noted in description) are sparkly and super cute.,48115,3
48116,"Cute shirt, too small.",48116,3
48117,"If your hair is puffer than 4 inches, this isn't for you.",48117,3
48117,And probably fake silk but I'll keep it.,48117,3
48118,Exactly what I wanted but the size was too small.,48118,3
48118,"Typically, I wear a large or x-large depending on the cut.",48118,3
48118,This x-large was too small.,48118,3
48119,"Its a very light  fabric, and it flows nicely.",48119,3
48119,The only reason I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't look exactly like the picture.,48119,3
48119,"I expected the darker, doubled up fabric v-neck in the front but that is not the case.",48119,3
48119,It is simply hemmed there but the same shade as the rest of the cover up.,48119,3
48119,Because of that it doesn't have much dimension and is a little lacking in design.,48119,3
48119,I probably would have skipped the purchase if I knew that before hand.,48119,3
48120,It was shorter than appeared in picture and very fitted.,48120,3
48121,I'm keeping it for guest but if your over 5'3 the torso will be to short.,48121,3
48122,I'm happy with the item but I ordered a Medium.,48122,3
48122,The shirt came in medium but the pants were marked small.,48122,3
48122,They do fit the person they were for so its all good but I'm not too happy about getting a different sized pants.,48122,3
48123,Perfect size for frontier personal item.,48123,3
48123,"Fits a lot, but my strap ripped out the first trip as I was carrying heavier stuff than my kids.",48123,3
48124,I really liked it,48124,3
48125,"Nice, but one of the straps broke as I was putting it on.",48125,3
48126,"Gappy around the arms., doesn't look very good",48126,3
48127,The Hurley print was on the inside of the shirt and for this reason I haven't wore the shirt..Is the shirt returnable..?,48127,3
48128,I liked the print order a size up because I read previous reviews but still a little tight.,48128,3
48128,"Had to return but, if I could have exchange for a 1/2 size up I would have done so.",48128,3
48128,The top did not fit at all(36DD) but I was not expecting it to; I just wanted the bottoms.,48128,3
48129,I have another one by the same brand in the same size that doesn't have the snaps on the size.,48129,3
48129,I like both really.,48129,3
48129,I wish they made the next size up from this.,48129,3
48129,My daughter was wearing this and pooped and it did not hold the poop in the we didn't realize and put her in the pool and the poop seeped out.,48129,3
48129,not sure if these are supposed to hold poop in but I don't see the point of a swim diaper otherwise.,48129,3
48130,I ordered up a size since I read it runs small.,48130,3
48131,Pleats were not stitched properly.,48131,3
48131,It would have fit great if the lining wasn't smaller than the outfit,48131,3
48132,"I like the design, and I like the concept of ratcheting belts.",48132,3
48132,"This one worked great, right up until the clasp broke about 10 minutes ago.",48132,3
48132,It lasted exactly 11 months.,48132,3
48132,"I don't think I wear things over tight or am particularly rough on anything, although I usually wear a belt, so it did get regular use from me.",48132,3
48132,It's tough for me to say what should be an acceptable life.,48132,3
48132,"A regular belt of course is mechanically very simple, so the leather tends to give out before the clasp, a process which takes years for me.",48132,3
48132,"This is the first time I've had a clasp break before the leather wore out, well the first time I think I've ever had a clasp break.",48132,3
48132,"I'll get another ratcheting belt I'm sure, although I will probably look around and see if any other options are considered more durable.",48132,3
48133,Usually wear large but ordered xlg when I seen it was cotton.,48133,3
48133,It fits like a large does.,48133,3
48134,I ordered this in a youth xsmall for my 5 year old son.,48134,3
48134,"Once I opened it, it was big enough to fit me.",48134,3
48134,Due to the fact that it came all the way from China it took 2 weeks and was not worth it to send back for a refund.,48134,3
48135,Nice top I always buy up in size because it runs small.,48135,3
48135,If it's from Asia expected to be 35% of the size that you want.,48135,3
48136,very thin and seethrough.,48136,3
48136,also chest area is big for me im 5'2'' 34c 130 lb but cute!,48136,3
48137,gave it as a gift,48137,3
48138,Great looking nice size but after 6 months broke :(,48138,3
48139,kind of big to keep in your pocket.,48139,3
48140,Thin fabric I ended up having to return due to the size I would have kept them if they fit,48140,3
48141,But it was about 3 sizes too small.,48141,3
48141,I should have known ordering from china,48141,3
48142,I like front wrap tops because the style is usually a bit forgiving in the abdomen.,48142,3
48142,"If you're pear shaped, the shirt doesn't cling to the stomach.",48142,3
48142,This shirt did not fit like I expected.,48142,3
48142,Neckline isn't super low cut.,48142,3
48142,"I'd suggest a camisole, but you might be able to get by without one.",48142,3
48142,Wrinkles if you don't pull it out of the dryer immediately.,48142,3
48142,Inside and outside layers of material at the neckline bunch up.,48142,3
48142,That draws more attention to the front.,48142,3
48142,It's not a slimming silhouette.,48142,3
48142,Light color (tan) makes the material and fit issue more prominent.,48142,3
48142,"If you bought a dark color, the fit issues might not be as noticeable.",48142,3
48142,Had to wear a compression camisole to smooth out my silhouette.,48142,3
48142,"If I hadn't, the fit would have been unwearable (for me).",48142,3
48143,Doesn't look like the glasses in the photo.,48143,3
48143,A little too oversized.,48143,3
48144,This is a glorified belt.,48144,3
48144,I knew it'd be short but that is criminal!,48144,3
48144,If you are petite or want something that gives you about 50% coverage this is for you.,48144,3
48145,The fit is snug.,48145,3
48145,I wear a medium shirt and after getting this on almost thought large would be better but this works.,48145,3
48145,The zippers seem like they're for left-handed people.,48145,3
48145,And the worst thing is that the pockets are located too high so too awkward to walk with your hands in the pockets.,48145,3
48145,Extremely long draw string for the hood.,48145,3
48145,The inner zip up layer is shorter and ends around the belly button.,48145,3
48145,There are also no inner pockets.,48145,3
48146,I did not look closely so did not realize they were clip-ons when I bought them.,48146,3
48146,I thought they were pierced post backs.,48146,3
48146,I would not have bought them had I known as clip-ons are prone to falling off & getting lost.,48146,3
48146,"I will be trying to remove the clip-on & attaching posts, but may not be successful.",48146,3
48146,I would happily buy another pair if they came in a version for pierced ears as I LOVE how they look when wearing them.,48146,3
48147,I'd previously ordered a blue/iridescent CK tie from Amazon that I'd assume the lighter blue socks in this 4-Pack would match.,48147,3
48147,"FYI, they are almost purple, not even periwinkle.",48147,3
48147,Still enjoy the set.,48147,3
48148,Needs to review the size!,48148,3
48148,I purchased my son's regular size!,48148,3
48148,However was too small!,48148,3
48149,"I got the Lapiz Lazuli, I absolutely loved it until just two days later a couple of the chakra stones fell off then the entire lapis lazuli stone fell out somewhere while I was shopping!",48149,3
48149,"I realized it was just barely glued in there, so sad.",48149,3
48149,I was so excited about it.,48149,3
48150,"It says 17 inches, but it seems more like 16.",48150,3
48150,The straps are uncomfortable and the bag doesn't feel...flexible?,48150,3
48150,It's a little stiff.,48150,3
48150,"I bought the teal-colored bag, and the color was way brighter than what was shown in the picture.",48150,3
48150,"Also, it is not shown in the picture, but the dangly black adjustable strap part does not have a sewn-down loopy part like most bags do.",48150,3
48150,"Instead, the edges have been burnt to prevent the ends from fraying out.",48150,3
48150,"Personally I didn't really like that, because I think it looks better with the loop and I like sticking my fingers in it.",48150,3
48150,also note: you probably cant stick a three-inch thick school binder in there unless you get the narrow kind,48150,3
48151,"Liked it but top didn't fitted well, very loose.",48151,3
48152,Kind of a foggy looking plastic and the flat end for inside the mouth isn't really flat.. More blunt than id prefer..,48152,3
48152,But the good part is that you could easily trim these down to fit your lips thickness if u didn't want to wear the cap peice.. Good to have on back up if you often need to hide the peircing..,48152,3
48153,Hats fine but it came squished in the package and it is difficult to get its shape back.,48153,3
48153,It's fine for the bachelorette party I got it for but need to work on packaging.,48153,3
48154,The pant legs fall at a weird spot so I only really wear this around the house or camping.,48154,3
48154,To the pool too.,48154,3
48155,I've been looking for a pair of high waisted jeans for a while and these are pretty good.,48155,3
48155,"I have a 24"" waist and I bough the size US 4 and it doesn't gape in the back like most of my jeans do, but it also doesn't cover my belly button which was what I was wanting.",48155,3
48155,"I'm 5'4"" and the rips are right on my knees which I'm glad for since the pants are a little restricting.",48155,3
48155,"I wish they were a bit more stretchy, but I also like how thick they are.",48155,3
48155,"Even though they aren't the best jeans I ever bought, I'm keeping them.",48155,3
48156,"I gave 3-stars only because of the design, 5-stars for everything else.",48156,3
48156,"The face shield looks better on the picture, but don't be surprised if your face shield does not look the same when you put it on.",48156,3
48157,I like this wrap.,48157,3
48157,"However, I ordered a medium based on the size chart and should've ordered a small.",48157,3
48157,The vecro over-extends the Velcro pad (if that makes sense?),48157,3
48157,so I have an extra flap.,48157,3
48157,"Now, I am pulling it really tight.",48157,3
48157,But isn't that the point?,48157,3
48159,"Pretty nice, but the ""antlers"" on the giraffe don't stick up as much as they do in the photograph.",48159,3
48159,"Also would be nice if they came with more color choices than white, gray, and blue.",48159,3
48160,"I really loved the dress, it was just too small.",48160,3
48160,"I would order in the next size up, but when I looked they were suddenly out of stock!",48160,3
48160,Very disappointed for that.,48160,3
48161,"Nice style, but be advised no lining in the bottom.",48161,3
48162,Wasn't large enough for my needs.,48162,3
48162,BUT..the leather and workmanship is outstanding.,48162,3
48162,The color is qorgeous!!,48162,3
48163,"I am 5'7"" 150 lbs and wear a 32 G cup.",48163,3
48163,"I ordered a large and there was no tag so I can't tell if it was accurate, I usually wear a medium.",48163,3
48163,The material isn't very stretchy at all and it's pretty itchy.,48163,3
48163,It is also 2 inches shorter then the wrist.,48163,3
48163,It did arrive 2 days before the soonest expected date.,48163,3
48163,I would have liked the material softer and have some pliability.,48163,3
48165,I like that shape.,48165,3
48165,It fits me well but the quality is not top...,48165,3
48165,They look cheap actually.,48165,3
48166,It looked just like the picture but it kinda looks old fashion for my taste.,48166,3
48166,It looked better on the model wearing it.,48166,3
48167,"difficult to put on by yourself needs 2 people with little fingers, lol!",48167,3
48168,No place for cards with personal ingormation.,48168,3
48168,You have to write it on the plastic.,48168,3
48169,I really wanted to love this skirt.,48169,3
48169,"It is lightweight, comfortable, and does not dig into my waist.",48169,3
48169,"However, I do not want everyone to be able to tell what color under garments I am wearing and with this skirt, its very obvious.",48169,3
48169,I had bought this skirt to tie dye in a project with my daughter.,48169,3
48169,"I am concerned even with tie dye, there will still be too much white space.",48169,3
48169,"Based on other reviews, I may return and try a different color.",48169,3
48169,It sounds like darker colors may work better.,48169,3
48169,I have also debated dying the skirt a darker color.,48169,3
48169,"The skirt itself is very nice, its too bad the white is so see through.",48169,3
48169,"Fast shipping, nicely packaged.",48169,3
48169,I always check for reviews and trust my fellow amazon shoppers to help point me in the right direction when purchasing products.,48169,3
48169,"If you found this review helpful, please click yes below.",48169,3
48170,I like the necklace but it fell apart and I have to have it fixed in order to wear it.,48170,3
48170,I wore it once before it fell apart,48170,3
48171,Burgundy NOT Red as stated,48171,3
48173,"When I saw these online, I thought it was a great deal to buy two tassel belts for $6 (with the shipping).",48173,3
48173,"I noticed that they would take a long time to come, but I was fine with that, and they came sooner than expected.",48173,3
48173,"When I got them, they looked great!",48173,3
48173,"However, after wearing the black one for a few days, one tassel felt apart and fell off.",48173,3
48173,"After fixing it and reattaching it, the next time I wore it the other tassel fell off!",48173,3
48173,The white belt still seems intact.,48173,3
48173,"However, the rope part seems to be unraveling, and I'll see how long this one lasts.",48173,3
48173,Bottom line: cheap quality for cheap price.,48173,3
48173,You make the decision whether to purchase or not.,48173,3
48174,Baggier and lighter color than pictured,48174,3
48175,Though cute this bathing suit did not fit my body type what-so-ever.,48175,3
48175,I am 5'2 and 130 lbs.,48175,3
48175,I ended up giving this to my sister who is 5'7 and it looks great on her.,48175,3
48175,Would recommend for taller girls,48175,3
48176,Colors on chest panel not what I expected and fit is very flowy.. not use if I'll wear or not.,48176,3
48177,looks great but it is not by any means long in the torso.,48177,3
48177,I am short with boobs and it needs to have a cute tank under it.,48177,3
48177,For the price it was worth it.,48177,3
48178,Not that long and beautiful in real life.,48178,3
48179,I Normally wear a large but this is huge.,48179,3
48179,It all depends on what kind of length you are looking for.,48179,3
48179,It is th e arm length that bugs me the most it goes all the way down to wrist and just looks huge.,48179,3
48179,If you are just wanting something to flow (a lil bit) and normally wear a large.,48179,3
48179,I would recommend getting a medium maybe even a small.,48179,3
48180,Cute cut but the material is very cheap and nylon,48180,3
48181,It's thin but cute.,48181,3
48182,I was a little disappointed in this.,48182,3
48182,It runs on the small side and the material is very thin.,48182,3
48182,"The only real thing about it, is a like the color.",48182,3
48183,Very Sexy Just Too Tight And Small.,48183,3
48184,"In the picture it looks like a 2 pieces skirt but it is a 6 pieces skirt, but it is still nice.",48184,3
48185,Fabric is a lot cheaper than I thought it would be,48185,3
48186,Didn't look right on my head.,48186,3
48187,The Color bleed on to my clothes but i loved it!,48187,3
48188,"Sizing is off, fits too small.",48188,3
48188,"Love the look tho, has a outdoor appearance but classy.",48188,3
48189,Colour was not as bright as expected.,48189,3
48190,it was beautiful but too small,48190,3
48191,"I like the look of this bra, especially as something to wear under a V neck t-shirt but it doesn't have enough spandex.",48191,3
48191,After a couple hours of wearing it the straps got wonky and kept falling down.,48191,3
48191,So it was both too tight and too loose!,48191,3
48191,I'm a 34C and it was quite snug.,48191,3
48191,The whole thing would lay better if it were a little less cotton and a little more spandex.,48191,3
48192,Sizes are way off...,48192,3
48192,I am normally a medium..,48192,3
48192,But because of the reviews I ordered an XXL and it fit great!,48192,3
48193,They look nice but they are cheaply made and the lens were not as oversized as I would prefer them to be,48193,3
48194,would recommend buying at least one size up,48194,3
48196,"It's a pretty design, the fabric reminds me of an nightgown.",48196,3
48196,"It's nylon material, and lightweight, polyester.",48196,3
48196,I don't know if I will wear it outdoors yet.,48196,3
48196,It feels like a nightgown,48196,3
48197,I saw this purse in a gift shop and I fell in love.,48197,3
48197,Good it for less here.,48197,3
48197,Only gave 3 stars because 1st day I used it 1 of the jewels fell out of the side and the zipper for your concealed carry doesn't want to stay zipped up all the way.,48197,3
48197,I do love the conceal carry pocket just sad that my 9mm doest fit.,48197,3
48197,Grip is slightly too long but it could possibly fit if it wasn't a 17 & 1.,48197,3
48198,I normally wear a size 14.,48198,3
48198,I carry most of my extra fat around my waist.,48198,3
48198,These were too tight on my waist.,48198,3
48198,IT was uncomfortable and gave me an extreme case of muffin top.,48198,3
48198,The material was thinner than I expected.,48198,3
48198,if I order them any larger they'll be too long.,48198,3
48198,THEY were already close to the floor.,48198,3
48198,"(I'm 5'8"") I'll be returning them, which is dosappointing, because they are really cute.",48198,3
48199,very nice but very small for an Xlarge.,48199,3
48200,The clasp broke second day and had to be sent back but I do love this watch.,48200,3
48200,I would give it a second shot.,48200,3
48201,"I'm not small, but I felt that my unit didn't fit well.",48201,3
48201,I have another brand that fits way better.,48201,3
48202,I absolutely loved this nightshirt till I washed it.,48202,3
48202,"Washed it in COLD water, and it shrank a whole size!",48202,3
48202,Just make sure you get it large enough to allow shrinkage.,48202,3
48203,Nice color but the waste & the  stitching are too tight .,48203,3
48203,I wear a size 10 pant,48203,3
48205,"I've had the item for about 2 months now, and the carrying handle as already broke.",48205,3
48205,It's okay for the price.,48205,3
48207,"The pants feel great
But the zipper is a piece of junk
Mine broke after 4 months",48207,3
48208,A bit too short but can be worn with leggings,48208,3
48209,Two of the pairs got holes in them the first day I put them on.,48209,3
48209,Be careful because the lace is more delicate than most.,48209,3
48209,They also attach their sales tags with the same color thread as the underwear which made me nervous that I would cut the wrong thing.,48209,3
48209,"They are very pretty on, though.",48209,3
48210,The neckline is too big for conventional t shirts,48210,3
48211,Love heart except for the paint on inside,48211,3
48212,Didn't realize it came with 3 elephant rings,48212,3
48213,The quality of the product was good.,48213,3
48213,The sticker where St Christopher is placed was off a bit on one I bought.,48213,3
48213,"The second one I bought was off too and I""m going to have to use an exact-o knife to cut there it doesn't fit in the frame.",48213,3
48213,It might be my boyfriend's car but I wish it was a bit longer too.,48213,3
48214,The quality is as expected.,48214,3
48214,It is short though!!,48214,3
48214,it doesn't go to my ankles and I'm 5'5 and weight 140lb.,48214,3
48215,This romper is SO cute.,48215,3
48215,"But beware, it fits REALLY small.",48215,3
48215,I got a size large.,48215,3
48215,it zipped up in the back and fit fine in the stomach and chest area.,48215,3
48215,But it's extremely short and rides up.,48215,3
48215,My whole butt stuck out of the bottom of the romper.,48215,3
48215,It literally was like panties!,48215,3
48215,"I am 5'3, have a shape similar to the model in the photo and have a short torso so this surprised me",48215,3
48216,String tore up after one week,48216,3
48217,pretty small for size,48217,3
48218,Great coat just a bit on the large size,48218,3
48219,SHORTER THAN THE LENGHT ON THE PHOTO.,48219,3
48219,IT SHOULD FIT WITH NO PROBLEM.,48219,3
48219,ORDER A SIZE UP.,48219,3
48219,AND IT RIDES UP NOT AT ALLL WHAT I THOUGHT,48219,3
48220,Looks smaller then I expected.,48220,3
48220,I bought this as a gift and it looks smaller then I expected.,48220,3
48221,It is ok for working out at the Gym.,48221,3
48221,"It is a fairly quality item,",48221,3
48222,"Great t-shirt, but way too small.",48222,3
48222,I usually wear a large but this feels and fits like a medium/small,48222,3
48223,It was made with really cheap material and hung to high in the torso area,48223,3
48224,"larger than expected, buy ok",48224,3
48225,Fabric is very thin and will likely not last long,48225,3
48226,And it had a hole in the sleeve but it can be fixed.,48226,3
48227,Bought two of these dresses and the sizing of them was drastically different.,48227,3
48227,Almost seems like they were made by two different manufacturers.,48227,3
48228,Even the large is small so take care with ordering.,48228,3
48228,The product is fine.,48228,3
48229,Wanted this to work!,48229,3
48229,"The chain size was fine, but could not fit my beads over the end caps after removing the screw-on part.",48229,3
48229,"My beads have fairly large holes, so this was disappointing.",48229,3
48229,"The heart on the extender is not ""puffed"" and three dimensional as shown in the picture.",48229,3
48229,It is just a flat cut-out.,48229,3
48229,"The metal is not as shiny as silver, of course, because it is stainless steel.",48229,3
48229,"It is a nice bracelet overall and looks very sturdy, but I will be sending it back because of the size problem and ordering a bracelet with a regular style clasp.",48229,3
48230,"Too small for me, gave it to my granddaughter",48230,3
48232,The Item does not fit as the way its displayed on line on the model.,48232,3
48232,From behin dit covers her entire behind but when I received it sad to say it fits like a THONG.,48232,3
48232,It's long as it looks like in the picture but the bottom is not accurately shown.,48232,3
48232,Even if you have curves as she does it still rides up into you behind and looks like a thong.,48232,3
48233,"I don't feel like it is tight enough or does much to my midsection, and it can roll down a bit.",48233,3
48233,I used the size guide when ordering.,48233,3
48234,Funny design but they shrink in the wash...,48234,3
48235,I love how this sweater looks and the material is a nice quality.,48235,3
48235,"However, a large fits more like a medium and seems a little on the short side.",48235,3
48237,The straps came discolored.,48237,3
48237,Bag is nice though,48237,3
48238,These are pretty small and are really hard to try and place correctly.,48238,3
48238,I had to keep fixing mine.,48238,3
48238,I think that these should be cheaper for the quality,48238,3
48239,Fits as ordered just an ordinary dress i had hoped it made more of a fashion statement but just a ho hum dress not sure if I will keep it has alot of loose threads so it may fall apart when  in the laundry,48239,3
48240,Good seller but socks more like a youth large not adult,48240,3
48241,Front print was a little off-center.,48241,3
48241,"I didn't mind, but you might.",48241,3
48242,Order a size up if you are busty fits way to tight but cute shirt,48242,3
48244,fits smaller than expected especially since I sent the measurements in.,48244,3
48245,"The shirt is beautiful, but shrunk a lot when washed, the material was so nice, but it shrunk up and became short on my husband.",48245,3
48246,I ordered in white.,48246,3
48246,The stitching between the skirt and top was a bit funky but I covered it with a ribbon also the skirt was tucked in kind of funny so it made the skirt poofy instead of flowy how I wanted,48246,3
48247,"Definately not true to size, runs small.",48247,3
48247,I am a small/med and ended up having to get a large.,48247,3
48247,"It still fits tight on the bottom by my hips, but the front fits fine.",48247,3
48247,For the price its a nice top.,48247,3
48248,"It fits a little snug, but I wear it to deliver the mail.",48248,3
48249,"Since this a one size fits all type gown, one can expect it to be rather large.",48249,3
48249,It seems pretty functional but a little complicated with the strings for adjustment.,48249,3
48249,I think it will still be a good option to have at the hospital and might be pretty convenient to wear after birth.,48249,3
48250,The shoe looks nice but run a little small.,48250,3
48251,Everything is OK except too small.,48251,3
48252,Even though I bought an extra large one it was still tight in the arms.,48252,3
48252,It also had a strange smell to it.,48252,3
48252,After several washings and airing on the porch the odor is gone.,48252,3
48252,Not sure what that was all about.,48252,3
48252,It works for what I needed as a limited wear costume.,48252,3
48254,Needs some spandex to do it's job.,48254,3
48255,It does the job for a costume I'm putting together (Jubilee from XMen) but honestly I would not wear this at work or casually.,48255,3
48255,"I'm a size small/4/6, and ordered an XL.",48255,3
48255,It's still pretty snug but any larger would fit weirdly.,48255,3
48255,Plus the button holes all need to be cut open and it probably wouldn't fit closed/buttoned anyways.,48255,3
48255,"But it came fast and in good condition and is priced alright, so three stars it is for a good seller!",48255,3
48256,Wallet is exactly how it looks although I misjudged the size of the wallet.,48256,3
48256,It is a little big and barely fits in back pocket of jeans.,48256,3
48256,The wallet is put together well and looks like it will last a while.,48256,3
48256,size just a little to big for me preference.,48256,3
48257,I really like this but it was a bit too clingy for me.,48257,3
48258,I like it but the lighter dose not I put stuff in it and it won't lit I would like to see if there is something else I can do to fix it or I want a different one,48258,3
48259,"Ordered the blue medium, not the same color as advertised.",48259,3
48259,"Loose strings on all of the stitching on the sleeves, looks poorly made and is not the correct color at all-will be returning.",48259,3
48260,"great material, as all their stuff is, but because of the straps to show the back more it is not very flattering on the front side.",48260,3
48260,not buying it again.,48260,3
48261,"See through, thin material",48261,3
48262,Too small for a 9 year old boy.,48262,3
48262,These are made for toddlers aged 3-7.,48262,3
48263,"Big and alil too stretchy, they don't keep there form very well.",48263,3
48264,I bought this in 12-18 months for my TWO year old and its waaaay too big.,48264,3
48264,It'll be another 8-12 months before he'll fit into this outfit.,48264,3
48264,Its super cute though!,48264,3
48265,"Pants are too long waisted, the waistband almost reaches my boobs.",48265,3
48265,And I'm not short waisted at all!,48265,3
48267,a cap is a cap.,48267,3
48268,"My son loves the shoes, but after 2 months already have a rip in them.",48268,3
48269,The fitting resulted somewhat over the size expected.,48269,3
48270,"Warm and light, but clumsy and a bit irritating to ear.",48270,3
48271,Not as well constructed as i thought for the price,48271,3
48275,Looks just like the pic.,48275,3
48275,Order a size or even two sizes up.,48275,3
48275,Material is comfortable but feels like Pajamas not a t-shirt.,48275,3
48275,Took 7wks to arrive in the mail.,48275,3
48276,"It is a good quality dress for the price, its just a bit too small.",48276,3
48277,the links are not soldiered or anything at least not on mine so it comes apart,48277,3
48279,"They were good, did the job but when I took them off the lens popped out and I've been unable to get it to stay in place.",48279,3
48280,"Pretty, bought two of them for my granddaughters.",48280,3
48280,One of them was fine but the other one my granddaughter kept breaking.,48280,3
48280,"Could be just my granddaughter,  she's not real careful.",48280,3
48281,Love the print but it doesnt look like the one on the picture,48281,3
48282,It's cute the ring is adjustable but the chain is so long... it doesn't look right on.,48282,3
48282,It kinda just flops all over the place.,48282,3
48283,these are not bamboo fiber....more nylon-lycra....,48283,3
48284,Well it's cute and different good quality too but it's asain size so not even the xl fit me.,48284,3
48286,The shirt was a little shorter than expected and doesn't hang as long or baggy as it does on the model.,48286,3
48286,"Especially, if you have a big chest.",48286,3
48286,Doesn't look that great.,48286,3
48286,It's a cute shirt but just not for me.,48286,3
48286,"I wear an L, and it was not flattering at all.",48286,3
48286,Just short and boxy.,48286,3
48287,I ordered a white one and received a beige shade.,48287,3
48288,"Very soft, but WAY to small, and shorter than expected.",48288,3
48288,The 2XL fits like a slim fit large.,48288,3
48289,"I loved this ring, but a month or two after I ordered it, the bead fell out all by itself and now it's lost and I am very sad.",48289,3
48289,I wish I could get a replacement ball because this one was so pretty.,48289,3
48289,I am so sad now.,48289,3
48290,Gruetli cover my bra but I still like the shirt,48290,3
48291,Was not the thickness / quality I have bought in the past.,48291,3
48292,Looks mostly like the picture though,48292,3
48293,It is ok for kids.,48293,3
48293,But it not deserved this price.,48293,3
48293,I will not recommend it to others.,48293,3
48294,"I ordered a 34F in US sizing, and received a 34G, but it was still slightly  small in the cup.",48294,3
48295,I had to give it away.,48295,3
48296,The dress looked nothing like it did on the picture and the sizing runs small.,48296,3
48296,Sadly I had to return it.,48296,3
48297,"The dress was really cute the first time I wore it, I actually got a lot of compliments on it.",48297,3
48297,"I ordered a medium (5'4"" 125 lbs) and it fit well.",48297,3
48297,I could have gone with a small as it is kind of stretchy.,48297,3
48297,It hits just above my knee and I wore with tights.,48297,3
48297,"It is a bit see though, but I got the camel color so it wasn't as obvious as the white probably is.",48297,3
48297,I didn't have to wear a tank underneath or anything.,48297,3
48297,"After washing it once, it has started to pull apart and the stitching seems very poor.",48297,3
48297,I guess you get what you pay for... would probably not recommend unless you only want to wear it once.,48297,3
48298,It doesn't look as good on me as it does for the model in the picture.,48298,3
48298,I felt like it was a little more baggy than I thought.,48298,3
48298,I ordered a small and it just clings onto my leggings.,48298,3
48298,It's pretty cute but not really worth it.,48298,3
48298,The quality of this dress is made poorly.,48298,3
48299,It fits because I read the reviews and ordered a larger than needed size.,48299,3
48299,"My gripe is with the cut, the neck hole is small, not nearly large enough to hang slant off the shoulder.",48299,3
48299,It's more matronly than I expected so it hasn't been worn.,48299,3
48299,"I keep thinking I'll enlarge the hole, but am too busy to take the time.",48299,3
48299,"The fabric is also a little icky, in my opinion.",48299,3
48300,I thought the color was accurately portrayed as it was in the picture.,48300,3
48300,The shirt was just way too small.,48300,3
48301,"This suit runs very small, I can get it on, but just barely!",48301,3
48302,Took other reviewers advice and went up half size and it was too large.,48302,3
48302,I thought this was a more sock-like fit but it had a tongue that came up high on my ankle not at all sock like.,48302,3
48302,Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes.,48302,3
48302,These just weren't what I was looking for.,48302,3
48303,Very pretty but even the small was too large.,48303,3
48303,I would have loved an extra small but that wasn't a size option.,48303,3
48303,"Fabric great, but sleeves a little too long even for 3/4 sleeve length.",48303,3
48303,"I am 5' tall, 105lbs, but I have a large chest.",48303,3
48303,"Thank goodness the whole thing is adjustable, but wasn't happy with how it hung on my chest.",48303,3
48303,"Hence I sent it back, even though I loved the color and print",48303,3
48305,This fit as expected.,48305,3
48305,"I am barely 5' 1"" and curvy so the straps would need to be shortened and the bottom hemmed.",48305,3
48305,"I loved the shape of it and really wanted to keep the dress, but the shiny material on top looked cheap, and the rounded part under the bust is replicated on the back, it looks like you should have boobs behind you!",48305,3
48305,":(  I planned to get a mermaid petticoat so the bottom would flare out more, but don't need it now.",48305,3
48305,I am returning the dress.,48305,3
48305,I ordered 4 long black dresses.,48305,3
48305,"As a bmaid in my friends wedding, she graciously said, choose a long black dress, whatever you want for a black tie event.",48305,3
48305,"So happy that we can wear a dress we know fits our budget and body style, but this one is going back, ended up keeping 2 of the 4 though.",48305,3
48305,Reviews are all out there.,48305,3
48306,The logo is rather large compared to her shirt in the film but over all a decent product.,48306,3
48307,These leggings are super cute and good quality.,48307,3
48307,They are extremely small!,48307,3
48307,A 4xl fits like a L or XL,48307,3
48308,"These are ""modern fit.""",48308,3
48308,They are not the same fit as the Frickin Hybrids (which are my summer staple - I own 5).,48308,3
48308,"I'm giving 3 stars because they don't suck, you just have to like the style.",48308,3
48311,Cheaply made but it's still cute would suggest,48311,3
48312,"I thought this was so cute but unfortunately after just two days of wear, the finish/ plating wore off.",48312,3
48312,Not too excited about that..,48312,3
48314,It's Chinese sizes so I ordered a 4x.,48314,3
48314,Normally I'd wear a xl (14).,48314,3
48314,"It's a bit saggy in the bum so I won't swim in it, but it's cute for laying around.",48314,3
48314,"Just a heads up, it has underwire and push ups in it.",48314,3
48314,I cut out the underwire and the girls fit a bit better.,48314,3
48315,Bottom fit but top too big,48315,3
48316,"I am a large slim size, 6' tall and 210-lbs.",48316,3
48316,"I ordered the XXL size, but I really need an XXXL.",48316,3
48316,"These coats come small sized, for real.",48316,3
48316,The material is as specified.,48316,3
48316,"I received my package about a month after ordering, because actually the coat had to be shipped from CHINA to my address.",48316,3
48316,I was hoping that the shipper that I ordered from kept them in stock.,48316,3
48316,"If I had known that, I could have ordered it directly myself.",48316,3
48316,"Oh well, I'll just give it away and order another one some day, if the urge is great enough.",48316,3
48316,The price can't be beat for what you get though.,48316,3
48317,"I mean, it's a cheap blazer, so hopefully no one was expecting much from it.",48317,3
48317,"I bought it as part of a Jane Lane costume for Halloween, and in that regard, it functioned perfectly.",48317,3
48317,"That said, holy wow is this poorly-made.",48317,3
48317,"I would expect it to completely lose its shape or tear in several places if I put it through anything stronger than the ""EXTREEEEEEEEMELY GENTLE SERIOUSLY YOU SHOULD JUST BE WASHING THIS BY HAND"" cycle.",48317,3
48317,"But I only intend to wear it one a year at the absolute max, so I won't be needing to wash it.",48317,3
48318,"Cute, but very fragile",48318,3
48319,"Cute top, a little large, but she will grow into it",48319,3
48320,Not very flattering for me.,48320,3
48321,"Fits a bit large in back for a size 6 petite, but I can still wear it.",48321,3
48322,Fine for the price!,48322,3
48323,"This product was ok, but I'm not likely to purchase again.",48323,3
48324,"Go up a Size, But looks very pretty!",48324,3
48325,"Alright, I got this swimsuit because it was cute and I really needed one.",48325,3
48325,"It fits pretty well, my hips are a bit big (between pear and hourglass shape) and I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.",48325,3
48325,"Sadly, when I got it in the mail, the thread at the top was coming undone.",48325,3
48325,"Seriously, I lightly pulled on a thread to see if it was at least worth 4 stars, but it smoothly came out.",48325,3
48325,It looked like it wasn't sewn well and the whole chest area was just a disaster.,48325,3
48325,"I'm 5'1, so it could be that my torso is short, but the pads they put for the breast....",48325,3
48325,It's way too high to cover all of my breasts.,48325,3
48325,"The padding area doesn't give ANY support, my chest was flopping all over the place!",48325,3
48325,"I'm a size 38C, so I did not expect for my chest to bouncing and sagging under the padding.",48325,3
48325,"But just like all other reviews, the swimming suit is comfortable and the fabric is soft.",48325,3
48325,It's a bit of a fail for me though.,48325,3
48326,"I was worried how the top but fit size wise, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it fit.",48326,3
48326,"However, I'm not used to this material and the bottoms felt like a diaper and gaped around the leg openings.",48326,3
48326,I'm interested to see how the material will react when wet,48326,3
48327,"Really good quality, fast shipping and nice shorts however they are for someone petite.",48327,3
48327,Still pleased they'll be a nice gift.,48327,3
48328,Very cute but run small,48328,3
48329,The material looks good but the finishings are not so clean.,48329,3
48329,It's ok for the price though.,48329,3
48330,Not very stretchy material.,48330,3
48332,I was expecting a thicker material and has lining inside.,48332,3
48332,"This is good for casual wear, not for winter season.",48332,3
48333,Fits small and the slit in the front was practically riding so high my crotch would be visible.,48333,3
48333,Will be returning this.,48333,3
48334,Cute but much smaller than I anticipated.,48334,3
48335,"fits nice,  ordered ivory and it completely see through.",48335,3
48335,not happy about it,48335,3
48336,"Quality seems about right (plastic, it's what I was expecting).",48336,3
48336,"The color was almost neon, much brighter than picture.",48336,3
48337,I love them they are just a little too tight on my feet so I guess I should of gotten a size bigger.,48337,3
48338,"The fit is ok, but there is a seam on the hips that is really unflattering.",48338,3
48338,"Not sure why it is even there, but it creates an ugly lump, so I am returning.",48338,3
48339,Took way too long to arrive.,48339,3
48339,Very tight despite getting the size I always get.,48339,3
48339,I was ignoring everyone who said get a size larger than what you originally get so now here I am with a tight-ish sweater.,48339,3
48339,It is however very warm.,48339,3
48340,Does not match-up to my expectations.,48340,3
48340,It looks nice on the outside.,48340,3
48340,It has large and functional zippers.,48340,3
48340,Inside not finished at the quality of the outside.,48340,3
48340,The material looks cheap.,48340,3
48340,I have not used it to see if it holds up over time.,48340,3
48341,The fit of this shirt is large.,48341,3
48341,It is cheaper looking then expected.,48341,3
48341,Not sure if buy it again.,48341,3
48342,Took along time to receive!!!!,48342,3
48343,I was very happy with this product upon first getting it!,48343,3
48343,"The materials are sturdy and good quality, nothing fancy, basic & durable which is what I wanted!",48343,3
48343,I couldn't wait to get it on!,48343,3
48343,And it wasn't bad I guess for not being laced very tight last night when I wore it for an hour to start seasoning it.,48343,3
48343,Well this morning I went to put it on again for day 2 of seasoning.,48343,3
48343,I had a bit more time to spend with it and I went a bit tighter.,48343,3
48343,Now I'm not as happy with it!..,48343,3
48343,"I re-laced it so it was right, put it on & tightened it up.",48343,3
48343,I got my waist down an inch and a half but when I look in the mirror the bottom almost can't go any tighter and I don't even have an inch up top or a half inch in middle to go tighter... so it's a size 29 instead of 26..... big difference....,48343,3
48343,"I was supposed to be able to lace down up to 5 inches and it only goes s max of 2.... the boning IS plastic after all not spiral steel boning... besides the front edges where the hooks and buttons are and the back edge where it laces, the description said it had 22 steel double bones... (so we're up to 2 disappointments now..) and to ""top"" it off.. the bottom won't lay down flat on its own.... so I'm trying to train it to lay down flat with a wide sash tied around the bottom edge.. and idk... guess i wasted my money & I'll have to get another.... pretty disappointed...",48343,3
48343,I'm my pictures you can see it's of good quality and looks great!,48343,3
48343,"But you can also see that there's hardly any lacing left and my sash around the bottom... then the side-view picture without the sash.... it doesn't show how the sides poof up, which I'd be fine with if the front didn't stick out like that..",48343,3
48344,Cheap fabric but made pretty solid.,48344,3
48344,I probably would have been good with a smaller size.,48344,3
48344,"I am 5'3, 130 lbs, pants size 3/4 shirt small.",48344,3
48346,The products for its price is very cheap.,48346,3
48346,The fabric is cheap and quality is cheap.,48346,3
48346,I ordered from here thinking I would get very good quality fabric.,48346,3
48346,I now know that I could get a much cheaper outfit somewhat like this in a regular department store with much better quality.,48346,3
48346,Only reason it has 3 stars was because the shipment is very speedy.,48346,3
48348,My granddaughter  loves.,48348,3
48349,High chested and very long at the bottom.,48349,3
48349,"Brought for alterations, they are going to do the best they can",48349,3
48350,I now own all the colors of this skirt.,48350,3
48350,Purchased all the same size but they seem to vary in actuality.,48350,3
48351,"I love the material and the color - but darn, it just runs too small.",48351,3
48351,I went up to the x-large because I love the skirt and wanted to own it - but alas will have to send it back.,48351,3
48352,Don't care for the fit.,48352,3
48352,Looks like a maternity shirt,48352,3
48353,I ordered this top recently and I couldn't wait to get it in the mail.,48353,3
48353,"It fit mostly how I expected but the frontal length I was expecting to be longer, i made do with the fact that it fit and it was still cute even if the length wasn't right, but as soon as I left the house one of the twisted sides ripped.",48353,3
48353,If you have a shorter torso I recommend fully.,48353,3
48353,"Runs a little small, but not bad.",48353,3
48355,This is not what I thought and it did not fit me right.,48355,3
48356,I was expecting more of a toddler size.,48356,3
48356,Hopefully she'll grow into them,48356,3
48357,The hair look good just don't like the lace.,48357,3
48358,"I liked the quality of this swimsuit, but again, the size is absolutely ridiculous!!",48358,3
48358,The top is small and the bottom is huge.,48358,3
48358,I am 38ddd and loosing weight.,48358,3
48358,So ordered XXL being L just for the top and it still doesn't work.,48358,3
48359,"the material is nice, but i just didn't like the way if fit.",48359,3
48359,i have since returned,48359,3
48360,I am about 5'5 and 115 lbs.,48360,3
48360,I ordered a medium and it was a little snug on me but was still very cute.,48360,3
48360,"However, the seam on the sleeve where the lace ends was so uncomfortably tight that I couldn't wear it for more than a few minutes.",48360,3
48360,Every time I would bend my arms the seams would dig into my skin.,48360,3
48360,It's a nice top but I would definitely order a size larger than what you normally wear.,48360,3
48361,Returning these shoes because they are too tight and the heel is too high for me.,48361,3
48361,Don't get me wrong the shoe is BEAUTIFUL!!!,48361,3
48361,I have reordered them from HuaMei.,48361,3
48361,They give you the option of sending them your measurements and you can pick your heel height!!,48361,3
48361,Littleboutique should do the same!,48361,3
48361,At least the return won't cost much because you return them to a shipping company in the US.,48361,3
48361,I will give another review when I receive them.,48361,3
48362,Like it but picture to small,48362,3
48363,It fit true to size.,48363,3
48363,"I am 5'2"" 112 pounds and I ordered an xs.",48363,3
48363,I am only giving 3 stars because the material is really weird.,48363,3
48363,It reminds me of a children's Halloween costume.,48363,3
48364,Zipper sticks and belt was missing.,48364,3
48365,Way too small !,48365,3
48366,"Honestly, I'm tired of these products coming from China that are not true to size.",48366,3
48366,"If you're going to sell directly to the American market, you need to specify for the American market.",48366,3
48367,So far I've only tried on these workout capris.,48367,3
48367,I bought 2 sets with different prints.,48367,3
48367,They do seem to fit slightly small compared to the same size in different brand workout capris.,48367,3
48367,The black with white hearts seem slightly see through.,48367,3
48367,They both are thin material so I'm hesitant to actually work out in them in public.,48367,3
48367,I'll update when I workout in them to test how they hold up with sweat.,48367,3
48368,The band is a little to tight ..,48368,3
48371,Two of the four charms tarnished beyond recognition shortly after wearing and had to be removed.,48371,3
48372,"I give three stars, the quality is great so it keeps me extremely interested.",48372,3
48372,But the bust is certainly not 41/42 for an XXL.,48372,3
48372,I tried to pull it past my chest and it certainly wouldn't budge.,48372,3
48372,I measured it myself and it's 36 all around.,48372,3
48372,"It shows as a XXL but from the measurement I have, it's certainly NOT!",48372,3
48372,Guess I'll be refitting this to a smaller friend.,48372,3
48372,Getting a 3x seems pointless if the measurements aren't even accurate.,48372,3
48373,I would reccomend ordering a size up.,48373,3
48373,I'm 5' 6 and 133 lbs and a medium was tight.,48373,3
48374,The top isvery widely opened.,48374,3
48374,needs something inside to feel comfortable,48374,3
48375,I can't raise my arms without my ass showing,48375,3
48376,Unscrewed the first day and I swallowed it.,48376,3
48377,"these boy shorts are alright, the one thing I dislike is that the leg part of the shorts rid up and create a roll under my clothing.",48377,3
48377,"Also, I wouldn't use them during warm weather as they don't breathe very well since its a nylon blend.",48377,3
48378,I've purchased a few leggings from this company and have loved them all.,48378,3
48378,"They were all labeled as high waisted, but only one truly was, but the others were fine.",48378,3
48378,"They also all had the tag ""Leggings Depot"" on the product when it arrived.",48378,3
48378,"However, I was disappointed this last time.",48378,3
48378,"I ordered the purple paisley, mixed pattern, color #NCPRX1231.",48378,3
48378,"When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it shipped from leggings depot, as expected, but the product had the tag ""Always"" ""Plus Size"" on it.",48378,3
48378,"Unlike the others, it was not their brand.",48378,3
48378,"When I went to try it on, the waist band fit a bit snug.",48378,3
48378,I'm a 16W or 18 misses.,48378,3
48378,"If I was a size bigger, these would not fit me at all.",48378,3
48378,And the major disappointment was the pattern.,48378,3
48378,"I fell in love with the pattern online, but the pair I received had huge gaps between the different floral/paisley squares.",48378,3
48378,Some of which weren't symmetrical.,48378,3
48378,It was a huge disappointment and I am sending this pair back.,48378,3
48378,"All the others were a love from this company and all were very soft and nice, including these.",48378,3
48379,The front opens a bit too much.,48379,3
48379,"I am a D cup size 12 woman, so filling out the shirt is no problem.",48379,3
48379,"I have found you either need a cute tank underneath, something cute you don;t mind exposing, or a pin of some sort.",48379,3
48379,Otherwise a beach type shirt.,48379,3
48380,Maybe I was confused about the special sizing chart.,48380,3
48380,Quality was what I expected for the price.,48380,3
48380,"Because it fit so strangely, I will be returning this suit.",48380,3
48381,"Didn't really care for how they fit, cheap enough not to worry about sending back.",48381,3
48382,"Really nice and handy, but now on second pair in less than a year as they are not as indestructible as advertised.",48382,3
48383,This is not a shirt I would wear on its own.,48383,3
48383,It's almost like a cami that you would wear under a sweater.,48383,3
48384,It was a beautiful dress.,48384,3
48384,"I put it on, checked myself in the mirror and the zipper broke.",48384,3
48384,"Took it off and noticed it was a thin, week zipper.",48384,3
48384,It needs a sturdier zipper.,48384,3
48384,Thank goodness I had a backup plan.,48384,3
48385,Nice if you are conservative.,48385,3
48385,Earrings a little too small,48385,3
48386,Cute dress and nice material but the arm holes are tiny!,48386,3
48386,If you have boobs it more than likely will not fit properly,48386,3
48387,I'm 5'1 so these leggings were a tad too big.,48387,3
48387,I had to bunch them up at the top in order for the leg portion to look like actual leggings.,48387,3
48388,The item was very nice but it fit way smaller than it should have for the size I ordered.,48388,3
48389,"Its cheap and falls apart, but was able to superglue it together for my daughter when she broke it.",48389,3
48390,Cute dress but it came with a rip in it.,48390,3
48391,very thin fabric and somewhat purplish tint to the fabric...did not match my white leotard,48391,3
48392,Okay length but the sleeves are tight.,48392,3
48393,I received this 2days ago and the pant was stained.,48393,3
48393,This is so wrong for a swim suit..,48393,3
48393,I do not think it's safe to wear.,48393,3
48393,Here are the pictures.,48393,3
48394,Got these for my husband to use boating.,48394,3
48394,After only 3 wears the back Velcro on one won't stay closed.,48394,3
48394,Fit well and are comfortable but not durable.,48394,3
48396,Wish it was a little for steardy,48396,3
48397,The masks themselves were perfectly fine for price.,48397,3
48397,"The issue I had was that the ribbon that was hot glued on were not even long enough to reach around my head as each side was barely over 4"" long.",48397,3
48397,There was no chance to even attempt to tie them for my wife and I.  I had to peel the hot glue and ribbon off and then find some string to get them to work for out party.,48397,3
48397,"If you don't mind possibly having to either exchange them or do a little DIY, the masks themselves were comfortable to wear for several hours.",48397,3
48398,It is an okay dress.,48398,3
48398,"It is made well, but it is not an outstanding dress.",48398,3
48398,"A woman has to have just the right type of body shape to love this dress; since I am pear shaped, the dress does not fit me well.",48398,3
48399,Would have gotten 5 stars of stitches hadn't come off near the pocket upon arrival.,48399,3
48400,"They are way bigger in the online pic, then in person.",48400,3
48401,these are nice but they have almost no slouch to them.,48401,3
48401,I wanted a slouchy beeny.,48401,3
48402,Kind of cheap looking and doesn't hold up to kids playing with.,48402,3
48403,"It's a little big for me, but I still like it, it's loose and comfy for a casual weekend.",48403,3
48403,"The bow it's not well sewn to the back, nothing I can't fix it with some thread and needle.",48403,3
48404,Too small for my Rayban and my sun glasses are not big.,48404,3
48406,I'm a size 6 and it seems my feet slide down and they fit a tiny bit too big but they're still wearable.,48406,3
48406,Gave me pretty bad blisters after wearing for a pretty short period of time but they are super cute.,48406,3
48407,"These shoes were great for my sister in laws wedding, but they have an awful smell that lingers for months even after you air them out.",48407,3
48407,"The shoes were fabulous the smell not so much, I would not be purchasing again.",48407,3
48408,I just received this product and I was really disappointed to see that there are scratches down on side of the barbell.,48408,3
48408,I've had better quality with buying the 100 piece tongue rings for like 5 dollars.,48408,3
48408,It feels comfortable on the tongue and it looks pretty nice too.,48408,3
48408,The jewel is a little loose and I can feel it on the roof of my mouth when I move my tongue which is also pretty disappointing.,48408,3
48408,I'm still going to wear it because my tongue is still healing and I wanted to wear a better metal.,48408,3
48408,I'll update if anything goes wrong overtime with wearing it.,48408,3
48408,I wish I could take a picture of it but amazon hasn't been letting me add pictures to my reviews unfortunately,48408,3
48409,Too small so I had to return.,48409,3
48409,The material is a little tough.,48409,3
48410,this product comes without winding instructions (essential for those who have only used watches with batteries) AND a solicitation for a good review.,48410,3
48410,"just received, so deciding if the hard to see hour, minute and second hands will do.",48410,3
48410,they are nearly impossible to see.,48410,3
48410,FAFADA: use 'hands' that can be easily seen (dark bronze or black)..... a watch with better mechanics and hands would demand a higher price.,48410,3
48410,the design IS good.,48410,3
48411,"I purchased this in white and black, but decided to return them because the fit is off for my petite frame otherwise decent product.",48411,3
48411,"The price is in line with the material, design, and fit.",48411,3
48412,"Coat is beautiful, but too small.",48412,3
48412,Have not received any response from seller regarding return/exchange.,48412,3
48413,These look a lot like long johns or pajamas.,48413,3
48413,They fit tight and are a little short.,48413,3
48414,"If you order this, order it a size bigger than what you actually wear.",48414,3
48416,"too much padding, good workmanship.",48416,3
48417,They are cute but do not look like the picture.,48417,3
48417,The ones I received are gold colored with a red logo.,48417,3
48417,"No blue, no yellow.",48417,3
48417,I don't wear gold colored jewelry so kind of disaapointing.,48417,3
48418,The dress is so cute and very good quality.,48418,3
48418,But it runs sooooo small!!,48418,3
48418,Was really disappointed when I had to return.,48418,3
48418,I would recommend ordering at least a size larger than you usually wear,48418,3
48419,The hat was a little big but my real problem was with the amount of distress the hat had.,48419,3
48419,It looked different in the pictures and was not as substantial as I expected from the description.,48419,3
48420,"Cheap materials, noticeable from a distance.",48420,3
48421,I bought a medium because I wanted to ensure it was a loose fit.,48421,3
48421,"It is tight everywhere, wish I would have purchased a large.",48421,3
48421,I am normally a small.,48421,3
48422,The bracelet was very pretty but way too small.,48422,3
48422,It said 7in but its more like 5in.,48422,3
48423,the top fit small and the bottoms fit really big.,48423,3
48425,Rather than give a bad review and knock on this product for being too small...however these were too small and such a hard shoe that I had to give them away.,48425,3
48425,"They fit my little cousin, and the design is awesome and true to the picture.",48425,3
48426,These fit as expected and I rate them as OK because they are more like fuzzy socks than slippers/house shoes.,48426,3
48426,"As for 'non-skid', well, I skidded in them on my wood floor.",48426,3
48426,"I like them just fine, but as I said, might as well wear a pair of fuzzy socks.",48426,3
48427,Nice jacket but runs small.,48427,3
48428,"Super cute, love it.",48428,3
48428,"A little big, and the first time it dropped it broke...",48428,3
48429,I purchased this for my 9 year old.,48429,3
48429,"It is really cute, and was as described.",48429,3
48429,BUT...small even for her :/  Fortunately I have a 2 year old that can wear it.,48429,3
48429,I did measure before purchasing...the seller description is incorrect.,48429,3
48429,"(according to the product description, the hat should have been a bit big for my 9 year old)  This does fit my 2 year old quite well, in case anybody out there is looking to buy a toddler a hat, lol",48429,3
48430,i got a small an it was still very loose.,48430,3
48430,loose around my rear as well an i am not a small grl so for a small to be loose on me is weird.cute color though,48430,3
48431,TL/DR; This is a REAL review for a product I purchased at full price on Amazon ($9).,48431,3
48431,"This shirt is OK quality for the price, and fits according to the size chart.",48431,3
48431,"However, the picture is misleading as the actual fabric is a bit heavier and more vibrant.",48431,3
48431,"Also, the shirt on the model is likely 2 sizes bigger than her actual size or a special cut for advertising purposes.",48431,3
48431,"QUALITY 
SIZING 
DESIGN 
ACCURACY OF DESCRIPTION 
PRICE 

I purchased this shirt in red and grey before there were any reviews online, but for the price and fact that it ships from China, I tailored my expectations.",48431,3
48431,"The material is different than I expected, but decent quality.",48431,3
48431,"From the product photos, I expected a looser cotton weave.",48431,3
48431,"The tag just has an ID number and some Chinese characters, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's more of a poly blend, and a tighter weave.",48431,3
48431,"I expected the color to be a bit heathered/worn, but it's much more vibrant.",48431,3
48431,The seller has since added some additional photos (sans model) that have a more accurate depiction of the fabric and color.,48431,3
48431,The product photo would have you believe this is a loose fitting shirt.,48431,3
48431,"I suspected that was not the case given American vs Asian sizing, and ordered a size up, but it still did not fit like the photo.",48431,3
48431,Yet the sizing chart is not inaccurate.,48431,3
48431,"For comparison, I've included a photo of the shirt I ordered in Medium in relation to a to a standard, size Medium Mossimo V-neck from Target.",48431,3
48431,They're very comparable in length and width.,48431,3
48431,So the complaints about sizing are really due to the implications of the product photo.,48431,3
48431,This was a cheap t-shirt of respectable quality.,48431,3
48431,"I wouldn't purchase it again, but that is because I was hoping for something more relaxed and airy looking, like the photo.",48431,3
48432,the only problem I had with this is it tended to fade after awhile so it was pink rather then red.,48432,3
48432,"Also it stank bad, Almost like  rotten flesh, But maybe that works for some?",48432,3
48434,"the shirt was made of nice material, but the fit was extremely small.",48434,3
48435,"The print is cute and all, but the sizing is very disappointing.",48435,3
48435,"Far too small than advertised, it is not an oversize fit, it is more of a fitted size which isn't as cute.",48435,3
48435,"The sleeves are too small, comes a couple inches short of my wrist and I am only 5'4"" so I do not have very long arms.",48435,3
48435,It is still wearable but it does not exceed my expectations.,48435,3
48435,"If you get one, order a couple sizes up and be careful washing.",48435,3
48435,Other reviews say it can easily get damaged in the wash.,48435,3
48435,"I'm going to use cold water, little detergent, gentle cycle and hang dry as a precaution.",48435,3
48436,"It's an okay dress, wish the back was a bit lower than the front.",48436,3
48437,I really liked the pjs HOWEVER they were so small I had to return them.,48437,3
48437,Bummer because they appear to be good quality and a super cute print.,48437,3
48438,It was much larger than I expected and really not age appropriate for what I wanted.,48438,3
48439,The width of the shirt is wide while the length is short.,48439,3
48439,I had to wear a long tank top underneath unless I want to flash people.,48439,3
48439,The material is not comfortable.,48439,3
48439,The seam up top is strange because it looks like it got sewn inside out.,48439,3
48439,This shirt is in dire need of improvement.,48439,3
48440,not the size i expected .,48440,3
48441,Really cute but cheaply made.,48441,3
48442,Not great quality and shipping time was very long.,48442,3
48443,I got it faster than I originally thought.,48443,3
48443,I like it but it's way lighter than the picture.,48443,3
48443,It's more of a pewter color.,48443,3
48443,"Other than that's it's alright, I haven't put it to any use for it yet.",48443,3
48444,"I am petite, a 32B and a size 1 in pants.",48444,3
48444,I ordered an extra small.,48444,3
48444,The bottoms fit perfectly and they are adjustable.,48444,3
48444,But the top was WAY too large.,48444,3
48444,They looked like they would fit a C to a D cup.,48444,3
48444,I would not recommend for small busted girls,48444,3
48445,I'm just not a fan of the back park of the pants.,48445,3
48445,The seem goes to low ..,48445,3
48445,But other then that they're great!,48445,3
48446,"Good quality for sure, but the product runs too large.",48446,3
48447,These plugs are cute.,48447,3
48447,"The ""white jade"" looks pink in the picture, but are really white in person.",48447,3
48447,"Also, these plugs art definitely not stone.",48447,3
48447,"They're very light and break easily; one of them arrived broken straight down the middle, despite being packed tightly in a bubble sealer.",48447,3
48447,"So I had my husband check the hardness (he and our sons collect rocks and minerals) and the mate to the broken purple plug rated about 5, as does typical glass, whereas amethyst rates about 7.",48447,3
48447,"All in all, they're not bad for the price, though.",48447,3
48447,I included a picture of the broken plug.,48447,3
48447,"I couldn't get my camera to focus properly, but you can tell where the surface was shattered.",48447,3
48447,"For the record, the plugs are not pretty swirls of color like stone plugs typically are; the variations in the picture are due to cracks and fissures catching the light.",48447,3
48447,"The actually jewelry is a flat, even color.",48447,3
48448,Material was to thin and wrinkled easy,48448,3
48449,It is BONE colored.,48449,3
48449,"Other than it, it is nice and organization is great~",48449,3
48450,This romper is cute but the proportions are off.,48450,3
48450,"I'm 5'4 140lbs and after following other reviews I decided to order a L although I'm usually a M. The top half for me fine (I'm a size 36C) so a medium would have been too small, but the bottom half was huge on me.",48450,3
48450,The shorts were awkwardly long and Were just too big.,48450,3
48450,"It's made of good material, but just not for my body type.",48450,3
48451,It's just not great quality,48451,3
48452,"I bought 2 of these, one for my daughter and one for me and both the same size.",48452,3
48452,Hers fit fine and she loved it.,48452,3
48452,Mine was too small and had some defects in the material.,48452,3
48452,Disappointed that it didn't work out for me but happy that it did for her.,48452,3
48453,"I have only ever bought Carters Foot Jammies, and i thought Gerber would be good to try.",48453,3
48453,I kept theese but we have only worn once.,48453,3
48453,"The foot part does not stay on the foot, it was really annoying following him around putting his foot back in.",48453,3
48454,Way too big for girls.,48454,3
48455,"Beautiful painted leather and good size for carrying wallet, toiletries, and everyday needs.",48455,3
48455,Lining material only problem for me.,48455,3
48455,It's flocked and things catch/ don't slide in or out easily when reaching into the bag.,48455,3
48455,Material also catches lint.,48455,3
48455,I am amending my original review to reflect use over a few months.,48455,3
48455,The lining falls apart and gets lint over anything in your bag.,48455,3
48455,"The bag is lovely to look at, but lining doesn't hold up.",48455,3
48456,Could be a little stiffer.,48456,3
48456,Not sure they'll last too long being worn every day.,48456,3
48457,I like the design of the wallet.,48457,3
48457,It holds every thing I need.,48457,3
48457,However the Strawberry color does not match the bag I already had.,48457,3
48458,"Like it, but fits large I'd recommend ordering a size down",48458,3
48459,Definitely a medium in large packaging.,48459,3
48459,Gonna give it to my niece.,48459,3
48460,This was very pretty.,48460,3
48460,"A little to tight in the bust area, even though I used the chart.",48460,3
48460,It didn't go to waste though.,48460,3
48460,I gave it to my sister.,48460,3
48460,All is well now.,48460,3
48461,"Super fast shipping ,is bigger than the picture and also kinda cheap looking but overall pretty good especially if you're using it for a few hours, can't beat the price.",48461,3
48462,The zipper separated from the garment on the first wear.,48462,3
48462,"Not that I can't see it, but other than that it was nice:) there's a little rubber lining to keep the deep v in place.",48462,3
48462,Would do well with a grey pencil skirt;),48462,3
48463,Was perfect under my swing dress however it rips easily.,48463,3
48465,This blouse is of good quality but the fabric is stiff.,48465,3
48465,It appeared to be softer and drapey but it feels like it's been starched.,48465,3
48466,It was a lot smaller than it stated.,48466,3
48467,I wanted this for a Gatsby party NYE and it fit the look BUT - the interior is quite small and the wrist chain broke within 1/2 hour.,48467,3
48467,"I was able to fit my flip phone, a lipstick, an ID and a credit card - that was it.",48467,3
48467,"I really wanted to get a comb and my glasses in it as well but alas, no such luck.",48467,3
48467,It's pretty but not very practical - even for an evening bag.,48467,3
48468,"It fits my phone nicely, but the colors aren't as bright as the picture.",48468,3
48468,They look muddy in comparison.,48468,3
48469,Most have stripped out in a week or two.,48469,3
48470,"too snug for me, these are not US sizes.",48470,3
48471,I have received and returned it.,48471,3
48471,I loved the corset however I needed to have ordered a  4x or 5x.,48471,3
48471,I shouldn't have ordered 4 sizes up instead of 2.,48471,3
48473,"Doesn't look as nice in person, and is a little tight in the shoulders  if you are wider.",48473,3
48474,I purchased these gloves and only used 2-3 times because while wearing the gloves -combined with body weight and moving around in different yoga poses - it causes the gloves to push on the skin in between your fingers and it is uncomfortable,48474,3
48475,The color is different than the picture.,48475,3
48475,But I like the design.,48475,3
48475,Nice for summer  !,48475,3
48476,"Ordered a size 20, received a size 24.",48476,3
48476,Have to tailor it see if it will fit properly on me.,48476,3
48476,Disappointed but not discourage it is a nice enough skirt for price.,48476,3
48478,The fabric is true to the online picture.,48478,3
48478,"Because it was rated as too small, I ordered the extra large.",48478,3
48478,"I don't think it's meant to close, which is a good thing because it's so tight it would only close on a small child.",48478,3
48478,"But the prink is fun and I like that part of it, the fabric has a nice feel and I like that part of the product.",48478,3
48478,I will wear it open over a cami; that will work.,48478,3
48478,"It was not what I expected, even taking all precautions to order it two sizes bigger than my normal size.",48478,3
48478,"But it's a ""fun"" top and I will wear it.",48478,3
48479,Looked good but the gray was white  for some reason.,48479,3
48480,"The fabric is soft, and the color is true to the picture.",48480,3
48480,"But this is way too long for the average woman; I'm 5'3"" and this goes past my knees.",48480,3
48480,"I'm giving it to my niece who is 5'6"" and very leggy.",48480,3
48481,It's a cute top.,48481,3
48481,I had to take the ribbons off the sleeves bc it made it look really awkward when i put it on.,48481,3
48481,A little shorter and tighter than i had hoped.,48481,3
48481,Still a cute top but not for the price.,48481,3
48482,"I'm 5'3""  about 125lbs and a 34d/34dd with little butt and no hips.",48482,3
48482,I ordered a large knowing I needed a bigger top for the ladies and figured I could maybe take in the bottoms if they were too big.,48482,3
48482,With Prime the bikini came in two days!,48482,3
48482,The top fits great!,48482,3
48482,"However, I was hoping to be able to wear it on both side and the solid side just looks kinda funny (I think partially because you cant remove the pads and you can really see them on that side).",48482,3
48482,I really wish you could remove the pads but I might just cut into it to remove and then re-stitch myself.,48482,3
48482,The bottoms run SMALL.,48482,3
48482,I normally wear a small (rarely a medium) bottom and these are a large and a little snug!,48482,3
48482,"I'm not just talking about the cheekiness (these are VERY cheeky - which I personally prefer), they're just snug on the hips and I don't have very big hips.",48482,3
48482,"There also seems to be too much material on the front of the bottoms as well, it's hard to explain.",48482,3
48482,Overall this bikini is just okay.,48482,3
48483,I like it but according to price it's expensive,48483,3
48484,Way way to small.,48484,3
48484,Ordered by size chart and it's to tight and to short.,48484,3
48485,You get your moneys worth,48485,3
48487,These kind of glasses looks perfect  but when wearing them the glass keeps coming out & it takes time to go fixing them.,48487,3
48488,"Really cute dress, great style and fit.",48488,3
48488,"BUT, the color shown is a really pretty chocolate brown, and the actual dress is a weird almost olive green.",48488,3
48488,Not what I was hoping for.,48488,3
48488,":( I've had this issue with another cowcow dress, so be aware the colors are not necessarily accurate.",48488,3
48489,The idea is wonderful but my son disagreed and always manages to pull it off,48489,3
48490,These a a great fitting style of men's jeans but the jean material is too thin for good work wear jeans.,48490,3
48490,My husband has noticed that over the years the jean material used has become thinner than in years past.,48490,3
48490,And he is not a fan of that.,48490,3
48491,I like the tank top.,48491,3
48492,Too large and not flattering at all.,48492,3
48493,It smelled like smoke (cigarette?),48493,3
48493,for about a week after it arrived.,48493,3
48493,Hung it outside for 1 week.,48493,3
48494,"The chain this came with was rather cheap, but I didn't expect much based on the price.",48494,3
48494,"The hearts themselves are nice and rather simple, I bought this as a random gift for my wife, she loves it!",48494,3
48494,Getting it on a better chain and it'll be even better.,48494,3
48496,Great for how many you get for the price but these are smaller then what I ordered they fall out all the time.,48496,3
48496,But if you just order a size up from what you need then they are worth it and great,48496,3
48497,A little big for my little one and not a true pink in color.,48497,3
48498,I bought the 12-Pack for my sister and I to split.,48498,3
48498,We wanted marled socks to wear with our bean boots and these were one of the cheaper options.,48498,3
48498,"As the other reviews mentioned, they aren't thick camp socks, but rather regular (thinner) socks with the same marled look.",48498,3
48498,"My bean boots are tied with the eastland knot and these socks constantly slip down when I walk, which is disappointing.",48498,3
48498,"However, if I tie my bean boots the old fashioned way, then I can tighten the shoe enough for them to stay up.",48498,3
48498,"I wear shoe size 7.5 and these were meant to be up to shoe size 6-9 and sock size 9-11, so I was hoping they would stay up a little better.",48498,3
48498,"Overall, I'm satisfied with the marled look and I like thinner socks for summer rainstorms, but I did wish they had a stronger elastic band to stay up.",48498,3
48498,"Also, they were pretty cheap.",48498,3
48498,"It did take a while for them to come (Ordered on April 9, Received on April 22), however they were all individually packaged well.",48498,3
48499,Pockets do not zip.,48499,3
48500,Love the sweater- it is too small though.,48500,3
48501,"Great watch, chain is very cheap.",48501,3
48501,Broke the first day I used it.,48501,3
48502,"It is really cute, but it's cut a bit short.",48502,3
48502,I am only 5'2 and it's a tight fit.,48502,3
48502,"I am smaller chested, which makes it OKAY to wear, if you need more room up top, its going to fit unconformably.",48502,3
48502,"I am usually a medium, so i ordered a large, and still am not 100% I will attempt to wear this in public.",48502,3
48503,the arm lengths are larger than the dress itself making the dress look awkward and the sewing and material looks really tacky.,48503,3
48503,i do however love the color and the scarf makes it look stylish,48503,3
48504,Zipper broke but did last for about one year.,48504,3
48505,Very cute but way smaller than sized.,48505,3
48506,"I usually wear a size 8 (but should wear a size 10 because I've gained weight), so I ordered a size large according the sizing guide.",48506,3
48506,"I ended up trading the large in for a medium because the former was too loose, especially at the waist.",48506,3
48506,I find this odd since most of my post-baby weight is distributed at my waist.,48506,3
48506,I'm not sure if the odd fit is due to my short torso.,48506,3
48506,"The medium fits a little better, although I could probably still size down if it weren't for the cut in the back.",48506,3
48506,It rides up enough where it can be mistaken for a thong.,48506,3
48506,Another issue I have is that the left and right center bands at the waist are not symmetrical.,48506,3
48506,"Despite my criticisms, I'll keep the item because the price was cheap, the top part is really cute, and I was intending to wear bike skirt over it to cover my bum.",48506,3
48507,1 of my diamonds fell out.,48507,3
48507,color has stayed and is beautiful.,48507,3
48507,More shinny than Pandora charms so stands out a little.,48507,3
48508,The product did not show up as shown here.,48508,3
48508,It actually has a paisley pattern and is much smaller than a normal medium Body Glove swimsuit bottom would fit.,48508,3
48508,I have several other Body Glove swimsuits and this one did not fit as the others.,48508,3
48508,"The only positive was that the light green color I was needing was located in the paisley pattern as well, so although it was not as expected it would still match the Body Glove swimsuit top I already have.",48508,3
48509,Looks very cheap up close ....,48509,3
48509,BUT  with Matt lipstickOn it looks  good.,48509,3
48509,The other rings don't work AT all !,48509,3
48510,So I got this necklace today.,48510,3
48510,It did arrive a bit earlier than forecast.,48510,3
48510,It is exactly the same as in the picture but up close it doesn't look as nice.,48510,3
48510,"It is cute, and it will work for what I bought it for.",48510,3
48510,"Be aware, the hands are plastic, not metal.",48510,3
48511,First time I put them on the  dark blue and gray Captain America socks they ripped at the heel.,48511,3
48511,Split right at the seam.,48511,3
48511,Any help with this?,48511,3
48511,The other pair fits fine I have them on now.,48511,3
48512,Thought it was longer but super cute,48512,3
48513,had to return because it is too short.,48513,3
48513,"I am 5'9', above ankle",48513,3
48514,I like this watch but it's not perfect.,48514,3
48514,The glass face protrudes above the metal rim and that has caused mine to become very scratched in a short period of time.,48514,3
48515,"rather cheaply made, but what do you want for the price?",48515,3
48516,"gave it to my daughter,  sleeves small on me.",48516,3
48518,Meets my need for white - wears well with white shirts,48518,3
48519,The material I very thin.,48519,3
48520,Cute but fit was not great.,48520,3
48520,Too small in body area but very large arm holes.,48520,3
48521,The the style was wonderful but it was just too small for me.,48521,3
48521,I should have ordered a medium,48521,3
48522,The undercloth/ slip is made of very cheap and unattractive cotton blend.,48522,3
48522,"I like the hang of the dress, so I removed the underlayer
and will wear the dress as a long tunic.",48522,3
48522,The overcloth is also much a flimsier weave than in the picture and the color is not a true red as in the picture.,48522,3
48523,It fit well around my chest area expect the top didn't have padding so i had to wear a bra underneath to fill it in.,48523,3
48523,I have a very small cup size so i had to do adjustments.,48523,3
48523,"Other than that, i did love the top.",48523,3
48524,DON'T HAVE DIDN'T FIT,48524,3
48525,"Fine for intended cosplay purposes, but very thin material.",48525,3
48525,"Had to buy a much larger size than when normally based on other comments, but they fit fine after that.",48525,3
48526,The shirt does not have the same detailing as the picture.,48526,3
48526,"The circle is way off center and the ""flames"" (which I thought were cute and why I purchased this shirt) are completly missing.",48526,3
48527,somewhat small but....I like it!,48527,3
48528,"I ordered these to be a little bit big for my son but he either grew without my noticing, or the shoes fit a bit small.",48528,3
48528,"He was only able to wear them a few times before they were just too tight, and we gave them to a friend with a smaller/younger little dude.",48528,3
48528,"So, size up, just in case.",48528,3
48529,"It's really cute, but tore the first time I wore it.",48529,3
48530,"The item is very nice, the fabric is good and design is as expected but order at least 2-3 sizes up.",48530,3
48530,"I am S-M as per US standards (Polo Ralph Lauren) and L as per European standards (Emporio Armani) and had to order an XL to fit perfectly, and still maybe a little tight.",48530,3
48531,A little small for the size posted.,48531,3
48532,Just received this bag today.. Not sure his much I like it yet.,48532,3
48532,"I ordered the gray, great color.",48532,3
48532,"Only thing is, it's a bit smaller than I thought it would be and the opening isn't as wide or as flexible to open as you think it'd be.",48532,3
48532,"The picture on Amazon shows the front buckle closed but it didn't come like that, my husband had to take a small screwdriver to open the lock, then you take that off, put the bar that holds the lock in the buckes to hold it down THEN put the lock back on :( doing this caused the opening to become even smaller.",48532,3
48532,Not sure if everyone's came like that but mine did.,48532,3
48532,I had to take quite a few things out of my previous bag to make everything fit in this bag.,48532,3
48532,Not sure whether or not I'll keep it but if you are fine with something smaller then this is the bag for you.,48532,3
48533,"I bought 4 of these and two of them (both grey ones), the threads are pulling away from the strap on the front above the breast.",48533,3
48533,I wear a bra underneath so there is no weight putting strain on the top.,48533,3
48533,Disappointed as I have only worn them a handful of times.,48533,3
48533,"Otherwise, they fit exactly as expected.",48533,3
48533,"I am 5'1, 150lbs, 34D and bought Large.",48533,3
48533,They are comfy and fit nicely with beautiful layering under my shirts.,48533,3
48534,"I bought this as a next size up for my child's current rainboot, StrideRite size 10.",48534,3
48534,I measured her feet and compared with the sizing chart provided and ordered a 12.,48534,3
48534,"Unfortunately it's the same size as her current rainboots, so will exchange and see if that works.",48534,3
48535,Colors were too NEON for me.,48535,3
48536,Can't fully load it (fill all slots) without it being hard to close.,48536,3
48537,These are very cute socks!,48537,3
48537,For me they don't quite work out how I'd like.,48537,3
48537,They roll down at the top and that's always annoying.,48537,3
48537,"I am 5""5 and 135lbs.",48537,3
48537,My thighs are kind of squishy some peoples aren't but mine are.,48537,3
48537,that might be why these roll down for me.,48537,3
48537,They are nice quality socks though!,48537,3
48537,"I bet if you have fit solid legs or just thinner legs you might not have this same problem, therefore you'd be getting some awesome socks.",48537,3
48538,These shoes are well made and look great but they are very big actually they seem to be about a size bigger than all his other shoes that are the same size.,48538,3
48539,too shear up top.,48539,3
48540,Has a funny smell.,48540,3
48541,"On the small size, and v-e-r-y light material.",48541,3
48541,Expected a sweater to be more than what feels almost like t-shirt material.,48541,3
48542,the fabric of the dress is not the best quality.,48542,3
48543,I was looking for a comfortable nightshirt but this is extremely large.,48543,3
48544,They were for my granddaughter.,48544,3
48544,They didn't fit her right.,48544,3
48545,Shirt fit but bottI'm doesn't,48545,3
48546,it is supposed to go on a Pandora chain however it is very easy to spot the difference in metals between a Pandora charm and this one.,48546,3
48546,However for the money you really cannot complain much.,48546,3
48546,It is very cute and stylish.,48546,3
48547,It works but was not the right configuration for my wallet.,48547,3
48547,Will try again to get the right one but this works for the interim.,48547,3
48548,"I like the quality of the pants,  but they wouldn't even fit over my butt.",48548,3
48548,"I lift a lot and would say I'm muscular,  so if you're skinny they should fit fine.",48548,3
48548,"For me they wouldn't even get halfway over my butt,  however they fit my calves well.",48548,3
48549,They are comfortable but not nude...more like a pale peach color; therefore they are more obvious while wearing even the tiniest peep toe.,48549,3
48549,I may try to dye or tea-stain them to reach a dark tan color.,48549,3
48550,It's like a pretty tent with a tight neckline.,48550,3
48550,I can wear it around the house or as a beach coverup.,48550,3
48550,Perfectly hides upper body configurations.,48550,3
48551,This bathing is the cutest!!!,48551,3
48551,The only reason why I gave it three stars is due to the quality of it.,48551,3
48551,I had to sow the corner of the bow to attach it to the bathing suit and the headband bow fell apart.,48551,3
48551,Besides that is really cute and my daughter won't want to take it off,48551,3
48552,It's a good hat for the value.,48552,3
48552,"The size may run a little large, you may have to put in some cardboard to bring it down to a large size.",48552,3
48552,"The design ""dollie"" on the brim is not quite right( a little wide)  for a Greek fisherman hat, but close enough.",48552,3
48552,"It's imported from china, so it is not a authentic Greek hat.",48552,3
48552,"It looks better in person, then in the picture shown.",48552,3
48552,"A few little corrections, and this would be a great hat.",48552,3
48553,Sized up and the bottoms were great but the top arrived a small cup size that was unwearable.,48553,3
48553,"Too bad, it's a cute suite.",48553,3
48555,"Cute jewelry, but heart was too small and unflattering",48555,3
48556,"Excellent for the price, delivery great, but very thin material and reflects the price",48556,3
48557,"Received cheaply made shirt with a big black box on the front with two big black ugly ""S"" lettering.",48557,3
48557,NOTHING whatsoever like described or shown.,48557,3
48557,Horrible beyond horrible and definitely not a Simply Southern shirt,48557,3
48558,"For a size 11 it is a bit tight, It is more like a 10.5 at best...It is a bit narrow for my foot..",48558,3
48558,I am going to try a strech it a bit...,48558,3
48559,Loved the style of the dress.,48559,3
48559,When I received it.,48559,3
48559,"the shoulder and chest area were extremely small, then the rest of the dress was alright.",48559,3
48559,"The material has absolutely no give, so if you have a larger chest or butt do not purchase this dress.",48559,3
48559,Cute dress too bad it doesn't fit right.,48559,3
48560,Wish straps were adjustable.,48560,3
48560,It would offer better support.,48560,3
48561,A little small for an XL,48561,3
48562,"Swimsuit is really cute, the rose between the breasts however is a little awkward and kind of for kids.",48562,3
48562,The bra size is too small though for the size I got.,48562,3
48562,"I thought it would fit but a tad too small for my chest, which makes wearing it awkward.",48562,3
48563,Okay for the price.,48563,3
48563,Not sure if it will shrink a bit after washing.,48563,3
48564,Too large but beautifull,48564,3
48565,"Pretty light weight, but what I expected for the low cost.",48565,3
48566,"Bought this for my friend (he is a medium typically), it fit a bit too short on him, but decently around.",48566,3
48566,"The design was well done, no fading or weird colors, exactly what it looks like.",48566,3
48567,"This is a pretty piece, but the bracelet came broken and I am waiting for replacement.",48567,3
48567,I purchased this to wear with a specific outfit for a specific occasion that has already come and gone.,48567,3
48567,Still waiting for the replacement.,48567,3
48568,"its ok, zipper doesnt work as well as i would expect it too but its only used as a back up",48568,3
48569,Material is a bit cheap.,48569,3
48570,"If you want your kid to wear them for a while, order up a size.",48570,3
48571,"very comfortable, nice sweater for a hang around the house.",48571,3
48573,Needs more card slots.,48573,3
48574,beautiful but it did not fit me I order x-L.,48574,3
48575,This was a little small for my wrist so i gave it to my wife to use on one of her watches.,48575,3
48575,It worked well on her wrist.,48575,3
48576,Started ripping after wearing twice.,48576,3
48577,See-through and they're not genuine leggings.,48577,3
48578,"I originally rated this as 5 starts, However after about a month, the clutch strap broke in two spots, making it rather difficult to fix.",48578,3
48578,"In the end, I'll likely dispose of this wallet.",48578,3
48578,"It looked nice and was very functional - I had several cards (it has adequate slots) and my phone inside along with some cash, receipts, and change.",48578,3
48578,I wouldn't call it over stuffed or mis-used when it broke.,48578,3
48578,It's a cheap wallet that looks nice - so just go into buying this knowing that fact.,48578,3
48579,Doesn't really look like the picture and it's a totally different color of pink than pictured..,48579,3
48579,It did arrive way ahead of the estimated time I was given...For the price it's not bad overall...,48579,3
48581,"This sweatshirt was tiny..I ordered a 2XL, I like them baggy, and I'm 6'3 so need the length, it was closer to a L. I was super bummed because I was soo excited to have it.",48581,3
48581,"But they refunded it, free shipping so I appreciate that.",48581,3
48582,I like the design & look of the belt.,48582,3
48582,I thought it was going to be bigger.,48582,3
48582,They need bigger sizes.,48582,3
48583,The photograph of the mannequin head wearing the bonnet is deceiving.,48583,3
48583,"I have a normal-sized head and shoulder length hair and this barely fit, which means that it crushed my curls, which was not the look I was seeking.",48583,3
48583,If this was only made in a larger size it would be great.,48583,3
48584,Fits but Bunch in the center.,48584,3
48585,"these are fake, but very nice.",48585,3
48585,fit comfortably and look super cute.,48585,3
48586,If u order it get a bigger size,48586,3
48587,"The front is the cheap-looking foam stuff on dollar store hats, but they made it look halfway decent.",48587,3
48587,"The fit is decent, but the shape is a little funky.",48587,3
48587,Hoping little look better after it's been worn a while.,48587,3
48587,The print on the main logo is decent.,48587,3
48587,The weathering is done well.,48587,3
48587,Its a good hat for the price it's listed at.,48587,3
48588,Bought these headbands when my daughter was 3 months old but it was too big.,48588,3
48588,and it still to big for her to wear.,48588,3
48589,"the skirt was super long, and the bodice was really tight... almost couldn't fit it over my chest.",48589,3
48589,Very different fabrics and not sewn very well to connect the bodice to the body.,48589,3
48589,"But you get what you pay for, right?",48589,3
48590,This is a great product - provides good support after a c-section.,48590,3
48590,The doctors and nurses were even impressed!,48590,3
48590,"However, I can't give 5 stars because it's too big.",48590,3
48590,"I measured myself according to Belly Bandit's website, and the chart determined I needed a size medium (which seemed accurate with my average build).",48590,3
48590,I am 12 days post surgery and I almost have the velcro maxed out.,48590,3
48590,"I'm bummed out because I was planning on wearing it for the next couple months, and the flaps of the overlapping section doesn't fit/look right under clothes.",48590,3
48591,it looks cheeper in reality than shown in pictures,48591,3
48592,It is cute and comfy.,48592,3
48592,Only 3 stars because some of the black washed onto the white.,48592,3
48593,This purse is beautiful.,48593,3
48593,"However, the size listed is way off.",48593,3
48593,It is much bigger than it states.,48593,3
48593,"I could fit a small 5 year old in this purse, that's how big it is.",48593,3
48593,"It is larger than the 18.5"" purse I originally bought and returned because it was too big.",48593,3
48593,Sadly I was slow on trying to return this and am past the 30 days.,48593,3
48593,Not sure what I am going to do with this - possibly a fancy laundry bag?,48593,3
48594,"I ordered a size large, based on all the other reviews for age/weight and when I received them, they definitely look too small/too short, but the quality appears really good.",48594,3
48595,IT IS JUST ON THE SMALL SIDE.,48595,3
48595,HAD TO LAYER IT.,48595,3
48595,REALLY NEEDED A 3X BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT ANYWAY!,48595,3
48596,"Item was very cute, but it ran way too small.",48596,3
48597,":D
But it says it's a choker necklace?",48597,3
48597,No it's not it's a really long chain but it's wonderful though!,48597,3
48598,"Beautiful dress, but zipper was broken when it arrived.",48598,3
48598,I didn't have time to wait for another to ship.,48598,3
48600,"Not quite sure of level of compression, but they are very well made.",48600,3
48600,Be sure you measure your foot according to instructions before ordering.,48600,3
48600,"I did that and they fit great if not a tad too big, but they do fit well.",48600,3
48601,I loved this shirt for a while but after washing it a few times the little elastic threads would start to pop out and look like hairs all over the arms and around the bottom of the shirt.,48601,3
48601,So sad because it is a flattering shirt and can be dressed up or dress down,48601,3
48602,"I like it, but it's simply too small.",48602,3
48603,I love it but I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it's still small :(,48603,3
48604,The product is put together fairly poorly and the fabric isn't quality.,48604,3
48604,That being said it was only $14.,48604,3
48604,so I'm giving it a 3 because 2.5 isn't an option.,48604,3
48604,Also no washing instruction... Not even a dry clean only... Wonder what kind of chemicals the Chinese use on something like this... Hmmm.,48604,3
48604,Oh also took almost 2 months to arrive.,48604,3
48605,Was smaller then I expected,48605,3
48606,This dress fits and hugs just right!,48606,3
48606,"However, the material is very then and the stitching is low quality.",48606,3
48607,Pretty short and shier.,48607,3
48607,Plan to wear something over it,48607,3
48609,I purchased a medium which should've fit but was a bit small.,48609,3
48609,I managed to wear it to my Halloween party with a shirt longer than I wanted so it would cover my rear when I sat down.,48609,3
48609,I was hoping to order a large for my next party this Saturday but they are out of stock.,48609,3
48609,The large probably would've been a bit baggy but at least I'd not be exposing my read end each time.,48609,3
48611,I get XL for 34 waist.,48611,3
48611,Pouch is quite small for me.,48611,3
48612,Very large and thin.,48612,3
48613,So I had to get a 3XL which fits like a large.,48613,3
48613,"It fits me well, but it's stinks like dye and chemicals.",48613,3
48613,"I heard that if you wash them, it'll shrink 3 sizes so I'm not sure what I'm gonna do, but it's a cute shirt!",48613,3
48614,"Very cute and well made , but had hard time fitting them over my pant leg.",48614,3
48614,And I'm only 105 pounds.,48614,3
48615,"It is very heavy, well made garment, but not for my needs in a hot humid climate.",48615,3
48615,I wanted something very light and flowy.,48615,3
48615,"Also, garment was not white, but off white.",48615,3
48615,"It wasn't a big deal to me, but the fabric smelled heavy like chemicals was a big deal to me because I worry about pesticides or toxicity..",48615,3
48615,"I ordered way up according to reviews and the companies own sizing chart, but it still didn't fit me right.",48615,3
48615,"The reviews about torso are true that it runs small, (drawstring fell too short under bust).The sleeves were too short and the length in the front fell to my knees.",48615,3
48615,I'm 5'6 size 6 and 34B.,48615,3
48615,"For shorter gals 5'2 or under, this should work well.",48615,3
48615,(Mine had a missing clasp at the top).,48615,3
48615,"Disappointedly, I returned it because of with the heaviness, the awkward fit, missing clasp, and smell, added up to to much trouble to deal with.",48615,3
48616,The cloth used in this dress is similar to what is used in umbrellas.,48616,3
48617,"The pendant and earrings are much larger than I realized and that will limit when I will wear this, but I do like it.",48617,3
48617,Can't beat the price and it came fairly quickly,48617,3
48618,I did get a large but I wish it were just a little larger...Otherwise it is a great top!,48618,3
48619,"It turned my arm red, but it is pretty",48619,3
48620,Arrival time was excellent.,48620,3
48620,Everything was right except the size was too small.,48620,3
48620,Its labeled XL but I tried it on and it fits like a regular large.,48620,3
48621,My husband is man-sized.,48621,3
48621,He is not some scrawny little hipster like I used to date in highschool.,48621,3
48621,"I would very much like to see my husbands scrumptious ass in a hot little see-though number, but I mean little as in ""fits but only just"" not ""well now *I* have some new lingerie, not my husband"".",48621,3
48621,this is a reoccurring problem with the mens lingerie that I buy FOR MY MAN!,48621,3
48621,THEY DON'T FIT MEN!,48621,3
48623,Material is too thin,48623,3
48624,a little cheap quality,48624,3
48625,"Just received the shirt today, the colors are a bit different from the image shown.",48625,3
48625,"The what appears to be white accent color is actually a light yellow, and the fabric of the shirt is a darker navy than shown.",48625,3
48625,This could just be from the lighting that the image was taken in but that should be noted for the buyer.,48625,3
48625,"I purchased the shirt in size Small and it's a little big, nothing terrible and expected from ordering clothing on Amazon.",48625,3
48625,The material is comfy and doesn't show any signs of being endurable.,48625,3
48625,Overall the shirt is good for it's price and everything else seems to be in top shape.,48625,3
48626,"I was a disappointed in the lenses, thought they would have a much better view than they do.",48626,3
48627,"Not high quality, but it was the only Mother-Son heart I could find that fits my wife's Pandora bracelet.",48627,3
48628,"Ran small, but a nice shirt.",48628,3
48629,Both Vitamin A and Runway Swimware.,48629,3
48629,"But on, it doesn't look as sexy as in the photo.",48629,3
48629,"I am smallish, 5'6"" 120lbs and I ordered the small.",48629,3
48629,The company was fine with the return/exchange for an extra small.,48629,3
48629,Still really cute especially with the Vitamin A Bronze Metallic suits.,48629,3
48630,"A previous review states that this top is sheer, I agree, the left side of the top is an open weave and requires a cami or tank underneath-I did not expect to have to layer other clothing with this top.",48630,3
48630,"While it is nice, it's definitely NOT worth the $64 charged for this top.",48630,3
48630,It's worth about $30 at most.,48630,3
48631,I'd give this five stars for the shape and fit of the ring itself.,48631,3
48631,The band itself is very smooth and has a good weight to it that makes it feel a lot more expensive than it is.,48631,3
48631,"However, after a week and a half of constant wear (I kept it on while washing hands, but took it off to shower, use hand sanitizer, wash dishes, etc), the gold plating has worn off to show a deeper copper color.",48631,3
48631,"(In my opinion, not as pretty as the original paler pink color, but also not horrifically ugly.)",48631,3
48631,"I know that plating wears off (my white gold jewelry turns yellow over time) and that jewelry reacts to the chemicals in your skin, but I didn't expect this to happen after only a week of wear!",48631,3
48631,"I wore this along side a 10k rose gold band, and by the end of the week the color distortion was highly noticeable, especially in sunlight.",48631,3
48631,"On the flip side, at the end of the week, the 10k band had noticeable scratches, whereas this ring still looked brand new.",48631,3
48631,"(Well, besides the coloring.)",48631,3
48631,"I think I may order the ""white tungsten carbide"" version and see if that holds up any better.",48631,3
48631,"Obviously the ring itself is of reasonable quality, so it may just be that whatever chemical is used in the rose gold plating doesn't work with my body chemistry.",48631,3
48631,"Pictures, for color comparison.",48631,3
48631,"The one with three rings are (left to right) 18k white gold, this ring, 10k rose gold.",48631,3
48631,"The one with four rings are 18k white gold, 14k rose gold, this ring, 14k yellow gold.",48631,3
48631,"The one with two bands: this ring (bottom) and 10k rose gold (top); the two rings were worn for the exact same amount of time (received the one with diamonds for Christmas), together.",48631,3
48631,"You can see the color difference, but also how scratched up the 10k band is!",48631,3
48631,Tungsten carbide for the win right there.,48631,3
48632,I give them 3 starts because I like the ribbed material but they roll down a little bit and won't stay up very high on my thigh.,48632,3
48632,I have average thighs...about 21 inches.,48632,3
48632,I bought other socks and the ones made with a softer material tend to stay up on my thigh better.,48632,3
48632,I like the color but it's annoying that they roll down a little bit and all of the stripes don't show.,48632,3
48633,"My first use: cple of articles of clothing, 1.5 full liter of water.. running through Penn  Station and the shoulder handle snaps & breaks.",48633,3
48633,Thank the good Lord that the shoulder straps themselves kept the bag on my shoulder.,48633,3
48633,"Fits a decent amount although I wish it were a little bigger, at least for city living.",48633,3
48634,I'm not too thrilled with this bathing suit.,48634,3
48634,"Its a beautiful bathing suit, I guess it just really doesn't work for my body type.",48634,3
48634,I am 5'2 and 150 lbs.,48634,3
48634,I have a 34c chest and I wear a size 4-6 in bottoms (depending where on the store).,48634,3
48634,"I think I am just too short for a high waisted bikini, so it just doesn't flatter my body type very well.",48634,3
48634,"I ordered a large where I typically wear a medium in everything else, the top fits perfectly (as I mentioned I am a 34c) but the bottoms are a little snug.",48634,3
48634,"Depending on the size of your chest and your thighs, I highly recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes depending how you like your things to fit.",48634,3
48634,The large is even boarder line too small for the bottoms.,48634,3
48634,"Another thing I want to comment on, the top is basically like wearing a bra.",48634,3
48634,"The design of the top itself,  and the way the pads are situated, it is like wearing a push up bra.",48634,3
48634,If you are uncomfortable with the thought of walking around in a bra (that is basically what this top reminds me of doing) than this style bathing suit may not be for you.,48634,3
48634,"I think I am going to keep the suit just for the top, because I personally do like the fit and style of it, but there is no way I can wear the bottoms.",48634,3
48634,They just fit me weird and the bottoms just look funny on me.,48634,3
48634,I gave the product three stars just because I find their sizing weird.,48634,3
48634,"It is weird and annoying to me to have to go up a size or even two sizes from your typical size, and in my case, I wouldn't be able to go up a size for the bottoms because you have to order the two pieces together and the xl top would be way too big.",48634,3
48634,"Gorgeous suit, just weird sizing.",48634,3
48635,A little too big in waist.,48635,3
48635,Should have ordered a size smaller.,48635,3
48635,Good quality for the price!,48635,3
48636,"I never thought I was shaped weird, but based on the other reviews and how these fit me, I must be!",48636,3
48636,I am a size 10.,48636,3
48636,It seemed like the medium would fit by the reviews but I received these and the waste was tiny for a medium.,48636,3
48636,More like a 4/6 to me.,48636,3
48636,"I ordered the large and although they fit in the waste, the hip area bulged out and puckered along the seam.",48636,3
48636,I would say these are much more meant for someone with a very small waste in relation to their hip size.,48636,3
48636,"The fabric is awesome, but just a weird fit for me.",48636,3
48637,Cute dress but you cannot adjust...the gap in the dress went up to my crotch so I can't wear it,48637,3
48638,"A bit too long, and hate that the sequin scratches your underarm.",48638,3
48638,"Other than that, pretty dress.",48638,3
48639,it looks a little bit bigger than size m,48639,3
48641,I returned for a larger size since the color could show through if it's a little tight in the back...,48641,3
48643,"The fabric is slippery, clingy, and flimsy.",48643,3
48643,There is a cute metal detail on the strap that goes horizontally across your back.,48643,3
48644,The legs are really tight.,48644,3
48645,Makes your but look small,48645,3
48646,great view but the rubber insert on the nose support fell off,48646,3
48647,"I was expecting the music notes to be white on black leggings, but this was not the case.",48647,3
48647,they are more like a fairly light blush/ pinkish color.,48647,3
48647,i bought 3 pair (as gifts) and when i received them all three pair were slightly melted together where the music notes are.,48647,3
48647,i lightly pulled them apart and they separated fine without damaging.,48647,3
48647,"i don't know why they were stuck together and if it was because of the heat during the shipping process but it makes me worry about the ""care"" process.",48647,3
48647,I personally do not dry my leggings however as i stated previously they were bought for a gift and if they are dried in a dryer i question their integrity.,48647,3
48648,This is not wool.,48648,3
48650,Love material and design no problems with product made and price good to purchase.,48650,3
48650,The problem was size.,48650,3
48650,Order medium but it's like a plus size in medium.,48650,3
48650,Which I'm not this would be for plus size an better fit for.,48650,3
48651,"cute top, but buttons rusted",48651,3
48652,"heavy and falls off face easily.. has hooks on the sides so you can put a string on it to keep it in place, but i got it for another purpose so i'm happy with the quality of the glass and am keeping it for my own (creative) purposes!",48652,3
48652,"convex on both ends; if you're wearing mascara it'll be hitting your eyelashes, but it's tolerable.",48652,3
48652,makes your eyes really big :),48652,3
48653,I loved the style but it was wayyyy to small .,48653,3
48654,There's not much to say about a lanyard.,48654,3
48654,It's a little bit longer than I anticipated which makes it an awkward length when you attach a badge/ID that needs to be more visible.,48654,3
48654,I had to tuck in the strap multiple times on the silver part to shorten it.,48654,3
48654,"Also, it's a little more pink that I thought it would be.",48654,3
48654,"That being said, the pattern is cute and fun and a nice way to sass up wearing a lanyard.",48654,3
48655,"I ordered XL and shirt fits but is clingy, not drapey like on the model so the neckline is not as wide/boatneck but rather t-shirt-like.",48655,3
48655,The pocket is crooked and it bothers me - defective or whimsical?,48655,3
48655,It's not maroon but a rusty red.,48655,3
48655,It's cute for the price but wonder if I will wear it that often.,48655,3
48655,"I love the thumb-holes and is a different, nice fall look.",48655,3
48655,Would be nicer if I could get a size up because of the wild sizing but I think XL is the cap.,48655,3
48655,Definitely order a size up if you can.,48655,3
48655,If you wear XL it will fit but not be roomy in the middle.,48655,3
48655,"It seems well-made, otherwise and isn't see through material.",48655,3
48655,"The sleeve-crocheted parts are a bit less soft than the torso material, too, but not uncomfortable.",48655,3
48656,The sizing is quite small,48656,3
48657,Cute ..looks as described,48657,3
48658,It protects but it fogs up easily.,48658,3
48658,Not good for sports.,48658,3
48659,It is not bad.,48659,3
48660,The chain broke once I got it but it's good quality.,48660,3
48661,"Quite small and not the best quality, but decent price.",48661,3
48662,The shoulders/straps are too huge.,48662,3
48662,I'm a 34D with wide shoulders and a medium kept slipping off my shoulders.,48662,3
48662,"However, it's super tight in the crotch area.",48662,3
48662,I could have fit a medium on the bottom half but a small on the top half.,48662,3
48662,I'd wear it with a bra as a top.,48662,3
48662,Wouldn't swim in it.,48662,3
48663,poor quality and way to easy to stretch out.,48663,3
48663,too loose on a baby to mark it is for 0-6 month baby,48663,3
48665,To small for me but still an amazing dress!,48665,3
48666,Cute swimsuit but the sizes were way off.,48666,3
48666,Went up 2 sizes and still didn't fit.,48666,3
48667,Black girls with butts do one size up.,48667,3
48667,Cute but very small.,48667,3
48668,The product came with deep wrinkles in the packaging so I tried ironing it.,48668,3
48668,"I don't know what I was thinking, but it melted the material.",48668,3
48668,I was pretty bummed but I still wanted to try wearing it since I realize it was my fault for melting it.,48668,3
48668,I was disappointed once I got in the water though.,48668,3
48668,The material loses its stretchy-ness and and just falls off really.,48668,3
48668,It's safe to say I don't pull it out much.,48668,3
48669,The quality is mediocre..I ordered a size us 12 and it was huge..like I need to go a size down or two to achieve a closer fit..not really sure if I am going to keep it,48669,3
48670,"It is so very interesting because we bought two pair one black and one charcoal, for some reason the charcoal was somewhat smaller than the black.",48670,3
48671,not what I wanted!,48671,3
48672,I ordered a small thinking it runs a tad big so I should go with the smaller size.,48672,3
48672,I usually fit in a small or medium.,48672,3
48672,I picked small and was so excited to get it in the mail!,48672,3
48672,I loved the look and everything!,48672,3
48672,"However, I'm only giving this a three because the top was huuuuggggeee!",48672,3
48672,I had to see up the back to make it smaller.,48672,3
48672,Additionally the bottom part of the top is all the same width so it just rides up your breasts.,48672,3
48672,For the extremely cheap price I was fine with just sewing it to make it better but had it been more expensive I wouldn't recommend.,48672,3
48672,"If you are willing to sew up the top, then for the price I recommend this suit!",48672,3
48673,Bought this for a trip to Costa Rica and to go ATV Riding (July 2016).,48673,3
48673,It was cute but smaller than expected.,48673,3
48673,"I'm 5'8 170lbs and based off the reviews, thought a medium would suit me best but it didn't.",48673,3
48673,I had to stretch it out a lot just so it could look decent.,48673,3
48673,Even wore a jacket because my bra kept showing in the front and back because the suit was too small.,48673,3
48673,"The material is very cheap, poor quality, and sheer.",48673,3
48673,You can see everything I had underneath!,48673,3
48673,I definitely wasn't expecting that.,48673,3
48673,"Most likely won't buy another one, especially if there isn't one with thicker material.",48673,3
48674,"It hides my tummy well, but the material is too light.",48674,3
48674,"If it was lined or made from a thicker material, I would give it a 5-star rating.",48674,3
48675,cheap material tears easily,48675,3
48676,Ordered a size medium but seems to be about a 36-38 length!,48676,3
48676,Everything else about the pair is great but the legs are sooo long for me.,48676,3
48676,I've been looking for a pair of  great fitting black pants and was hoping this would be the pair.,48676,3
48677,Nicely designed  Beautiful fabric  Order one size up  I wear mine backwards and this opens the bust area  Viola  People complain cause they use poor judgement  If you like it buy it  It'll look good,48677,3
48678,This is a really nice suit but is extremely small in the chest.,48678,3
48678,I would have given more stars if it had been bigger.,48678,3
48678,I ordered largest size and still wouldnt even begin to accommodate my chest.,48678,3
48678,It's really sad it didn't fit because it was a nice piece.,48678,3
48680,"I just don't know if I like the material, but it fits ok!",48680,3
48681,They are very cute.,48681,3
48681,I give this only 3 stars because you have to have skinny feet to wear these comfortably.,48681,3
48681,I have slightly wide feet and these barely squeeze on and I can't wear them long without my feet cramping.,48681,3
48682,The lace isn't sewn down all the way but it's cute!,48682,3
48683,Was to large in some places and ok on other places,48683,3
48684,Not what I expected not a swimming suit.,48684,3
48685,I really liked these glasses until I realized how easily they can get scratched.,48685,3
48685,After 2 weeks I could hardly see out of them.,48685,3
48685,I took good care of them and kept them in the case but they still ended up scratching very easily.,48685,3
48686,"had to return too small, my fault",48686,3
48687,I got mine a little tight as I didn't read the sizing information.,48687,3
48687,It also took awhile to receive.,48687,3
48687,It unraved after the first time that I hand washed it.,48687,3
48687,"If you have a event to go to I would make the purchase as it does work, it's just not a very long lasting item.",48687,3
48688,I bought this for roughly $5 and as a joke.,48688,3
48688,I didn't expect anything even half decent.,48688,3
48688,.I figured it would work for about a week and then die off.,48688,3
48688,I've had it now for about a month and a half and still working great and I charge my phone about 3 times a week with it.,48688,3
48689,"all sizes are toddler, so the shirt is short and wide.",48689,3
48689,"it's super cute and good quality, but toddler sizes don't work for us anymore.",48689,3
48691,"I loved the look of this shoe but when I tried it on, it was too high to wear comfortably and the weight of it  made it kind of ""clunky"" and noisy when you walk.",48691,3
48691,"I could probably adapt to the height, but not the noise.",48691,3
48691,Disappointing because I loved the look of this shoe and all that it would have gone with.,48691,3
48691,"I think I would like it in a 2 1/2"" - 3"" heel at most,(with a front platform of 1-1 1/2"" for height comfort) and made of a lighter weight product so that they didn't make noise when you walk.",48691,3
48691,"It was a great quality shoe with a unique look, but it won't work for me.",48691,3
48691,I am returning this product.,48691,3
48692,"Not as pictured....it looked like cotton/linen blend in the pic, but it's think ciffon like fabric with a slit on each side and elastic waist.",48692,3
48692,Plus is I can use it as coverup dress.,48692,3
48693,the arms were loose and the neck is awkwardly cowled but not the way a cowl neck is supposed to be (and in the image it doesn't look like it is supposed to be cowl neck at all).,48693,3
48693,Its ok for the price.,48693,3
48694,The top doesn't cover ANYTHING!!,48694,3
48694,I got a size Large because most reviews said it ran small.. Bottom fit nice but top pieces were only about 3 inches wide.,48694,3
48694,Not enough coverage for anyone with the slightest bit of a chest!!,48694,3
48694,Gave 3 stars because it is made of good quality material.,48694,3
48694,(I am 5'7.. 145lbs.. 34 C chest),48694,3
48695,I Bought this to my wife and she couldn't wear it.,48695,3
48696,good for the price,48696,3
48697,"It's a cute piece of costume jewelry, but I have a hard time keeping the chains from tangling throughout the day.",48697,3
48698,"I'm giving them three stars even though I had to send them back because they appear to be well made, and I like that they have a zipper and laces, and aren't the floppy ""shiny sock"" tops that always slouch stupidly around my skinny calves.",48698,3
48698,I'm usually a 7.5 and I ordered an 8.,48698,3
48698,I should have listened to the other reviews and gotten a 9--I can't even wear them for five minutes.,48698,3
48698,"Other than that the angle of the shoe/heel seems comfortable, and if you get the right size I would imagine they'd work great.",48698,3
48700,The kimono I received has different colors- orange flowers with olive green..,48700,3
48700,Very different than what's shown in the picture.,48700,3
48701,Cute very shiny but tangles easily,48701,3
48702,not good on size,48702,3
48703,The price is very high.,48703,3
48704,The dress fit nicely and is unique so you'll stand out in this dress.,48704,3
48704,If felt pretty and that I stood out in the crowd.,48704,3
48704,I also received lots of looks and compliments.,48704,3
48704,"The dress is made of the thick stretchy material so I would advise against wearing it in the summer or in a hot climate, especially if you wear shape wear underneath.",48704,3
48704,If you're not prone to sweating or overheating then ignore that bit of advice.,48704,3
48704,The dress is VERY long as other reviewers stated.,48704,3
48704,I suggesting ordering with enough time to have the dress hemmed (if possible given the appliques).,48704,3
48704,The top is completely sheer except for the strategically placed appliques in the front.,48704,3
48704,If you need to wear full body shape wear underneath then you'll have to have the top of the dress lined.,48704,3
48704,"I felt pretty, but I was HOT.",48704,3
48704,I noticed a hole in the dress along the seam in the front of the dress when I put it on to wear to the wedding I was attending.,48704,3
48704,That was only my second time putting on the dress so I was pretty annoyed.,48704,3
48704,"Overall it was a decent buy, but I'll be contacting the seller for a price adjustment given the hole.",48704,3
48704,"The dress is unique (the appliques against the color was a nice contrast)
The material has give
The color was as pictured (I purchased the mint green)
The sizing was correct
The dress photographs well
The sheer back makes you feel sexy

Cons..",48704,3
48704,"The material is not suitable for hot climates or the summer time
The train is way too long
The sew in cups are cream colored and NOT suitable for people with darker complexion.",48704,3
48704,"The sew in cups are pointy (some breasts may be pointy, but mine are round so I needed to replace the cups).",48704,3
48705,Fits well but the dress has a huge slant in the front.,48705,3
48705,It is intended to show a lot of thigh.,48705,3
48705,It is great for people who are comfortable with the style.,48705,3
48706,They are shorter than I thought they'd be.,48706,3
48708,The sleeves were too short,48708,3
48709,"These come from China, which means I waited nearly a month to get them.",48709,3
48709,They are thin and I don't see them holding up for any length of time even if I baby them.,48709,3
48709,"That said, the color is a nice gray, they fit snug on my small hands so if you have large hands don't bother.",48709,3
48709,For my purpose they will do what I need.,48709,3
48709,"My office is a freeze zone even in the summer, my hands get so cold while I type.",48709,3
48709,I think these gloves will help with that problem.,48709,3
48709,I think next order I can't honestly say I would recommend these but the price was really great.,48709,3
48710,I was disappointing that the no show socks were too small and the 5-8.5 size was the only only size available and I thought being a size 8 foot they would be fine.,48710,3
48710,They are not and there were no instructions on how to return them.,48710,3
48710,I am sorry they aren't made in bigger sizes.,48710,3
48713,its cute but its too small.,48713,3
48713,i usually wear a small but ordered a medium just in case.,48713,3
48713,the sleeves were waaaaay too short for me.,48713,3
48713,im going to reorder in extra large,48713,3
48714,Order took way too long.,48714,3
48714,Was ready to cancel order.,48714,3
48714,Also way too small for the large size.,48714,3
48715,Disappointed it was delivered with a stain.,48715,3
48715,"Otherwise, the top is nice.",48715,3
48716,"Unfortunately this did not fit....I'm 5'4 120pds with a short torse and I got this in a medium (I usually wear a small, but followed other reviews saying to buy a size up).",48716,3
48716,Also the colors aren't as pastel as the photo advertised.,48716,3
48716,More on the bright/neon colorside which makes the design of the suit look a little cheesy.,48716,3
48717,This not  like it.,48717,3
48718,Dress is ok. Kinda small and fabric is kinda thin and doesn't hold its shape up top as well as I'd hope.,48718,3
48718,It's not the worst but you know...you get what you pay for,48718,3
48719,For the  right body this could be a five star dress and for other types a 3 for quality and price .Definitely looks nicer than a $10-15 dollar dress .,48719,3
48719,It is not itchy it is sheer and lightweight perfect for the spring or summer but too light for the fall .,48719,3
48719,It has a slip so it is not see through ( see second pic )  .,48719,3
48719,I got the powdered blue one -the color is beautiful  and makes me think of Easter .,48719,3
48719,"I gave it 3 because my  body type is big top  (34d) thick upper thigh /hip rest all thin or normal for height 5""3  .",48719,3
48719,It gave my body a whole new shape I did not like makes me look like I am widder have a stomach and a butt I wish I had lol but overall I felt 8-10 pounds heavier in this which was a bummer .,48719,3
48719,"I would not suggest this to anyone under 5""6 unless plus sized and curvy because you'll be swimming in it  .",48719,3
48719,"If you're a taller (over 5""6 ) and have a lean or curvy  body  this is also would be a great dress  for you .",48719,3
48719,maternity  wear would have been great for this also !,48719,3
48719,Because it flows and has a lot of room and material in the middle .,48719,3
48719,Hope this helps .,48719,3
48719,Note : Product runs large .,48719,3
48719,Small would fit  woman sizes 4-12 .,48719,3
48719,Go down a size .,48719,3
48720,Cute but just too big.,48720,3
48720,I liked the style.,48720,3

48721,It arrive after I needed it.,48721,3
48721,but it was too small anyway.,48721,3
48721,It'll go into the Good Will box,48721,3
48722,Bottom sole started separating from the actual shoe two weeks after wearing them.,48722,3
48722,I fixed it with strong craft glue and some clothespin.,48722,3

48724,My dad paid for it since his eyes suck.,48724,3
48725,This is a sturdy fabric bag that has enough room and pockets.,48725,3
48725,"However, the side pockets are too small to really fit anything in (especially if you want to get it out - my hand doesn't fit).",48725,3
48727,A little thinner then expected.,48727,3
48727,Dont plan on using it as a kids pillow but it does make a nice toy pillow,48727,3
48728,I bought one in a different print in Large and it fit but this one was too small and I had to return it.,48728,3
48728,The sizing seems to be off print to print...my daughter bought 4 of these in Small and they all fit her differently..,48728,3
48728,They are all Urban & Co.,48728,3
48728,I would buy more if I knew the actually size measurements of each print.,48728,3
48729,Its reasonable for a tote-around purse.,48729,3
48730,I expected this to hang better.,48730,3
48730,Like the picture shows.,48730,3
48730,"And the slip is shorter than the hem, and you can see that.",48730,3
48730,"The chest piece and the back detail are very cute, but the sleeves hang odd too.",48730,3
48730,I'll have to alter this to make it work.,48730,3
48731,The dress was really pretty and exactly like the pictures but measurements are off by about two inches.,48731,3
48731,Order bigger than normal size when ordering this product.,48731,3
48732,It looked cute but the stitching was undone in the middle of the dress where it's supposed to hold the side tie in place.,48732,3
48732,Didn't want to deal with sewing it myself so I had to return it.,48732,3
48733,Color was darker and different but I still liked it,48733,3
48734,It was not snug,48734,3
48735,"I used it a few times doing yard work, it was hotter than my old straw hat I was hoping to get rid of.",48735,3
48735,The issue is the elastic band inside the rim.,48735,3
48735,I creates a seal so you get no air flow to your head.,48735,3
48735,I'm thinking of returning it  or tearing the elastic band out.,48735,3
48736,I like the skirt very much and it fit me well.,48736,3
48736,Buyer should understand that it's a wrap skirt.,48736,3
48736,There is no zipper.,48736,3
48736,The shirt is very small and it is wrinkle.,48736,3

48738,"The material is comfortable, but also VERY thin (see through in the sunlight).",48738,3
48738,"It is very cheaply made, but I guess you get what you pay for.",48738,3
48739,Nice wish they still made them,48739,3
48740,The top is way too small hate the fact that the top is 2 pieces makes it look cheap & dumb,48740,3
48741,"Color is great and design seems good, but the shirt seems to hang limp and lifeless, draping the upper body.",48741,3
48741,"It's not bad, but it's a look that only works in certain circumstances --  circumstances in which one does not usually favor a button-up top.",48741,3
48742,son loves pugs and this shirt,48742,3
48743,Says 3 pieces I only received 2 ....so sad :(,48743,3

48749,I really wanted to like these as there aren't many leggings that are really made for men.,48749,3
48749,"The main issue is the length, Im 5'10 with a 32"" inseam and running tights and leggings are usually and inch or 2 short as it is, but these are SUPER short.",48749,3
48749,"shortness aside, I really like the material, its soft and comfortable, and waist wise the fit is great.",48749,3
48749,Ive attached some pics so you can see for yourself.,48749,3
48749,(these photos should be ok since some of the others shown show way more),48749,3

48750,"however I am 5'2"" 160 lbs with 36D chest.",48750,3
48750,I ordered Large but there was absolutely no way my chest was going to fit in this shirt.,48750,3

48750,I had to return it even though I really liked the shirt.,48750,3
48751,It's good but fabric is thick and heavy.,48751,3
48753,looks good just too small,48753,3
48754,Too small and it felt like it was choking me,48754,3
48755,why is there a zipper with no pocket.,48755,3
48755,also the full zipper was messed up at the bottom,48755,3
48757,"looked better in the picture however, I like the ring enough to keep it..",48757,3
48758,Good shorts ripped the crotch 1st time he went skating,48758,3

48761,Not as stretchy as I hoped.,48761,3
48763,The top of socks are not finished and the sock runs small on the top for the leg.,48763,3
48764,After a few washes it starts to pill.,48764,3
48764,But I will still wear it on a cold NY evening by the fire.,48764,3
48765,But product ordered not delivered.,48765,3

48768,This top was way too small.,48768,3
48768,The color was perfect and the material is nice.,48768,3
48769,"It's a pretty swimsuit, but the fit is a little weird.",48769,3
48769,"Just like on the model, there is a little bit of bunching that ends up looking like fat rolls, even though I'm 110 lbs soaking wet.",48769,3
48769,"I would've liked a little better padding in the ""chest area"" (did I mention 110 lbs?",48769,3
48769,"I have no chest area), and for the fit to be just a little more flattering.",48769,3
48769,"It's not terrible, but it's not going to be my first choice out to the beach either.",48769,3
48770,The design is super cute but the actual shirt was oddly tailored.,48770,3
48770,"The arm holes are small, the neck hole is really wide, and the bottom snaps are too close togetherwhich makes her diaper bulge out.",48770,3
48771,This lingerie looks sexy but it is too small.,48771,3
48771,"I normally wear size M (I am small on top and medium on bottom ) , I am 5'5"" and weight somewhere around 127.",48771,3
48771,Small breast and wide hips.,48771,3
48771,I bought the model named Black 1 and definitely is not for Medium.,48771,3
48771,If I placed it to have a good fit on the breast then the thong piece would be halfway down my butt crack .,48771,3
48771,but if I placed the bottom correctly then the bottom of the bra part would be like 2 to 3 inches under my breast band.,48771,3
48771,I would advise not buy unless you are a petite medium or a small.,48771,3
48773,Feels good but size not as expected.,48773,3
48775,Worth the price !,48775,3
48776,Does not look like the picture.,48776,3
48777,I wear size 8... ordered a US10 and it still runs small... also shirt is see through...,48777,3
48778,Same as picture and great quality the only reason 3 stars is because it was too small.,48778,3
48778,I'd  get 2 sizes bigger next time!,48778,3
48778,"Otherwise, I love it :)",48778,3
48779,"I like these tongue rings, but there were quite a few copies and at least 10 of the balls have broken.",48779,3
48779,There were some surprise glow in the dark balls.,48779,3
48780,But it's way too small,48780,3
48781,It would have been a 5 if the pattern went all around instead of just in the front.,48781,3
48782,"Brighter pink than pictured, but looks nice.",48782,3
48782,"Size is small Asian Size, order up for correct fit.",48782,3

48784,One for my self and one for my other sister.,48784,3
48784,Mine a large hers a medium.,48784,3
48784,Hers fit perfectly however mine was not that much bigger than hers.,48784,3
48784,There was hardly a difference between the two in size.,48784,3
48784,She can wear both perfectly.,48784,3
48784,But it was too small for me.,48784,3
48785,"The waist band is fine, but the buckle!",48785,3
48785,A BUCKLE FOR ANTS!,48785,3
48786,They tug and pull when being worn also have me an infection,48786,3
48787,Ordered 2 of these the same size.,48787,3
48787,But when received one was an A cup and the other was C/D.,48787,3
48787,Then once you get them stuck you still have to wait and make sure they stick before latching.,48787,3
48789,"Nice design, not the highest quality.",48789,3
48789,The fabric seems dyed as there are white fuzzie frays coming off the bottom of the lace.,48789,3
48789,"It's sewn adequately, it feels handmade which is fine, I just don't think the material is the best quality.",48789,3
48789,It is pretty though.,48789,3
48789,"Nice for casual outings, nothing elegant",48789,3
48790,"The top was confusing to wrap and wouldn't stay in place, even for average smallish boobs, there was not enough material to wrap around as many times as the model Had wrapped around her torso.",48790,3
48790,Bottom fit perfect (maybe even a tiny bit big),48790,3
48791,I thought I was getting a shirt for a 10 year old and it was more for a 5 year old.,48791,3
48791,Need work on listing children's sizes on web site.,48791,3
48791,Quality of shirt is fine.,48791,3
48792,"I loved the way it looked, my daughter wanted a ankle length dress to wear for a wedding and this was perfect.",48792,3
48792,"Until it got here, she wears a size 6, so I ordered the 6.",48792,3
48792,It was a little too long and too tight around her chest.,48792,3
48793,Thought it was bigger.,48793,3
48793,A little disappointed .,48793,3
48793,But I'll keep it.,48793,3
48794,the pants came faster than expected.,48794,3
48795,Somewhat too small but my Mom likes it any way.,48795,3
48795,I only wish that it also came in a 5x because that would fit perfectly.,48795,3
48796,"The necklace is very pretty, but the little chains broke a few times.",48796,3
48796,I have had to put it back together within an hour of the first wear.,48796,3
48796,"There are multiple levels of chains, which I personally enjoy that look.",48796,3
48796,The leaves are also very pretty.,48796,3
48796,"The metal is a bit thin, and you can easily bend those leaves in half.",48796,3
48796,"I would assume if they were thicker, the whole necklace would be heavier which would be painful.",48796,3
48796,I still use the necklace.,48796,3
48796,I think it is sturdier after i re-chained most of it.,48796,3
48798,"I liked the necklaces overall, however; I am not sure what the chain/string part is made of but when you shower with it, the water turns black.",48798,3
48798,This has not yet caused the color to fade but it is not pleasant.,48798,3
48799,"The color was way too bright, almost orangey I prefer a cherry red.",48799,3
48800,Ordered a size larger - better safe than sorry  I thought.,48800,3
48800,I double checked the size chart and ordered a size up which was an XL.,48800,3
48800,The XL fits my size 8 daughter perfectly.,48800,3
48800,"I'm crushed, but she is delighted.",48800,3
48801,Fits well but flops in bubs eyes once it gets wet.,48801,3
48801,I would also buy a color next time since our sunscreen seems to stain it a bit.,48801,3
48802,I do not like to write negative reviews but these gloves seemed to get wet while I was skiing.,48802,3
48802,I checked to see if it was user error or sizing issue but that did not seem to be the problem.,48802,3
48802,"If just playing in snow, these gloves are alright but not great for skiing.",48802,3
48802,It was also hard to dry them out without a dryer (I was at a ski lodge and was not about to pay to dry just my gloves in the dryer).,48802,3
48802,"I did, however, enjoy the ""wipe your nose"" feature and the zippered pocket on top because I could just slip my lift pass/hotel key and have it handy.",48802,3
48803,Very cheap but I did not pay much.,48803,3
48805,"Excellent design and comfortable to wear, more so for those who cannot wear wrist accesories or feel uncomfortable wearing silicone bands.",48805,3
48805,"Nice colors, but expect them to be a little bit different than the photo.",48805,3
48805,"The materials are pretty good and seem sturdy enough, plus there are no edges to scratch you with.",48805,3
48805,"It's also pretty simple to put your fitbit tracker in and out of the ""box"" of the clip.",48805,3
48805,Unfortunately I still can't find a place to clip it where I can get an accurate count of my steps.,48805,3
48805,"The flex was designed for arm movement and it does have issues reading steps when you clip on your shirt, bra and waist band.",48805,3
48805,"Maybe for strenous exercise it will work better, but for everyday movement you will read much lower depending on where you attach the clip.",48805,3
48805,So far mine has read anywhere from no steps at all to about 40% of the steps.,48805,3
48805,I will attach to my shoelaces next and I expect that will make it very accurate.,48805,3
48806,Scratchy material that irritated my aunt's skin when she worked.,48806,3
48806,She also had to take in the dress at the waist despite the length being perfect for the job.,48806,3
48806,The dress is durable  but she now has to wear a slip to prevent irritation when she perspires.,48806,3
48807,It was great till it got wet and it got too big.,48807,3

I marked this at a 3/5 as there were several issues with this item.",48808,3
48808,The pendant itself is very cute and very small.,48808,3
48808,"I loved the idea of being able to wear multiple necklaces and this be a perfect fit, however the second day I wore it, the chain snapped.",48808,3
48808,"I had to order this item twice because I never received the first one, just for the actual one I did receive to break.",48808,3
48808,"I would order this under caution or ensure you have a different chain you'd be willing to use to switch it too, otherwise you'll probably lose the pendant, I was lucky that the hood of my sweater held mine until I noticed it was gone.",48808,3
48809,This hat is not as large as one I had.,48809,3
48809,"It may stretch, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.",48809,3
48809,If you guys start making a xxl let me know.,48809,3
48809,I have to wear 3 or 4xlt shirts and 15 shoes so things that are too small are not a real big surprise.,48809,3
48810,Need to buy a size bigger!,48810,3
48811,Ankle part is to loose without anything to secure foot inside.,48811,3
48812,Pretty dress but the material wasn't what I was looking for.,48812,3
48813,"I'm pregnant and pre-pregnancy normally wear a large, I ordered a large.",48813,3
48813,It was too baggy at the top which is a rare case for me as I am pretty busty.,48813,3
48813,I probably could have returned it for a medium but I decided to pass because the material was a bit cheap.,48813,3
48813,I'm rating based on fit/material.,48813,3
48813,The actual print and cut are really pretty.,48813,3
48813,If the large fit how I hoped then I would have kept it and maybe rated it a 4.,48813,3
48814,This is not what I expected I was better off buying a tutu like I started to.,48814,3
48814,It's pretty small too I wanted a puffy skirt and beautiful shirt the skirt is flimsy not very happy,48814,3
48816,"I would have liked the bra if the band was larger, or more stretchy.",48816,3
48816,"At 7 months, I am a size 42 band now, but my cup is still small, a B, so it is hard to find a bra!",48816,3
48818,using as a blouse,48818,3
48820,so cute but was super short and shrinked even more after one wash.,48820,3
48821,Little tight in the thigh area,48821,3
48822,I am a size 6/8 and I could not get this dress on.,48822,3
48822,I also did not like the material that it is made out of.,48822,3
48822,I has hoping for a cotton blend/more of a casual look.,48822,3
48823,I thought these were really sassy and they're cute but when one of them is tightened all of the way the balls don't face the same direction so you cant see what it says which is a bummer :/,48823,3
48824,Nice looking but out of style.,48824,3
48824,Current style is narrower ties (around 21/2 to 3 inches).,48824,3
48824,This a wide tie of 4+ inches..  Not is style.,48824,3
48825,"Disappointed that the picture shows Silvertone  hardware but got a brassy gold tone instead ....other than that love the size, shape & design",48825,3
48826,"Good color, but when they arrived they were supposed to be *small*, but were actually labeled 140-160cm and were WAY too bit for my 4-6x kiddo.",48826,3
48827,Nice jeans but too small.,48827,3
48827,I would say get one size bigger if you want these to fit!,48827,3
48828,"okay, cute for the price but pretty cheaply made, the buttons on my white ones are falling off already.",48828,3
48829,Didn't fit as expected.,48829,3
48829,Should go a size up.,48829,3
48830,should have got a bigger size..,48830,3
48831,"I may have ordered too big a size, or the color I chose may have contributed to it (mint), but it was a little unflattering with the ruched shoulders.",48831,3
48831,I felt very wide looking.,48831,3
48831,"However, I was looking for a mint colored dress that was inexpensive that I could breastfeed in, and this did the job.",48831,3
48832,"Cute for a few wears, pull the strings through the loops with tweezers!",48832,3
48832,It works like a charm to lace it.,48832,3
48832,Fabric is the kind that shrinks so I would definitely wash on cold and air dry,48832,3
48833,Stones do not look as if they could come unset which is great.........,48833,3
48833,BUT this ring looks as if it has been constantly stretched open and then closed again.,48833,3
48833,There's a very weak spot in the very middle-back of the ring (the part that sits underneath your toe).,48833,3
48833,It looks as if it will snap in half soon.,48833,3
48833,I almost want to order a second one and just hope the first one was just a defect.,48833,3
48833,It's just that pretty.,48833,3
48834,Not bad for the price but does not really do much for the lower butt.,48834,3
48835,they are cool minus that the came easily apart and not fixable.,48835,3
48836,Cute but shoulders a little small and didn't sit quite right on my body.,48836,3
48837,I loved the coat!,48837,3
48837,And how light/thin it was but the only down side about it was that it runs small.,48837,3
48837,I just gave it to my sister and ordered another one in XL hoping it will fit because I really liked it.,48837,3
48838,fabric looks a little cheap... and it runs a little too short,48838,3
48839,"Expected a more comfortable, looser fit, with enough tails to tuck in without binding up.",48839,3
48839,They need to copy LL Bean sizing.,48839,3
48840,Did not expect it to be to tight honestly I was hoping it would be a little more flexibly since its longsleved the concept was great but Its just a big bother Its a shame too I guess I'll remember next time to get a size up when ordering internationally,48840,3
48841,I'm too tall for it.,48841,3
48841,The cinch hit me funny.,48841,3
48843,The dress is nice but the material looks nothing like what is pictured,48843,3
48844,Ordered a large for my husband and they're still a little tight.,48844,3
48846,"On the top between the collar and bust line there is puckering, will have to get it altered before wearing.",48846,3
48846,It is a champagne color not gray.,48846,3
48846,Otherwise it is a very nice dress.,48846,3
48847,"Ordered a medium and it has a wider, short, boxy fit, more like a boy fit than the women's fit it appears to have, but we needed it for ""space night"" at camp so it fits the bill fine despite the odd shape.",48847,3
48848,"I bought the largest size offered, a Large, and it is a bit tight on me.",48848,3
48848,"I have a 38"" waist and normally wear an XL in underwear.",48848,3
48848,The front/pouch area fits fine and looks good -- it's just the circumference around my waist that's a bit tight.,48848,3
48849,Tight across the bustline,48849,3
48850,Love the dress but runs VERY small,48850,3
48852,Fit is good but material is extremely thin and shows all wrinkles.,48852,3
48852,"In white, cannot wear without a slip.",48852,3
48853,It's not as small as I expected for xs.,48853,3
48854,"Product was exactly as predicted if not better, however the material is very cheap.",48854,3
48855,"Will have to pitch it when the battier dies, Can't find a way to replace It.",48855,3
48855,Not a good fit.,48855,3
48855,Could use more  spacing material.,48855,3
48855,Took 4 weeks to received it.,48855,3
48855,I didn't know that.,48855,3
48856,my baby is 6 months and I bought 6 months it fit until I dried it .,48856,3
48856,I would recommend going a size bigger.,48856,3
48857,I bout a small and it fits like an xl...fabric is too heavy,48857,3
48858,"For this price with free shipping, I guess one cannot complain much.",48858,3
48858,"However, the triangle shaped pendant in the middle was off center by two inches and did not hang straight at all.",48858,3
48859,"closure clasp broke on the first day, but I like the design",48859,3
48860,The socks are ok however they keep unbuttoning.,48860,3
48861,I was very confused about how to open this umbrella.,48861,3
48861,It is a manual open umbrella.,48861,3
48861,I couldn't figure out what made it open.,48861,3
48861,After looking at reviews I decided to try again.,48861,3
48861,The material was stuck together.,48861,3
48861,After I separated the material it opened no problem.,48861,3
48861,It's a very pretty umbrella.,48861,3
48862,I am a 34b and bought a small and was swimming in it.,48862,3
48862,It is not snug on the arms or bust as in the photo.,48862,3
48863,"I expected them to breathe, but they don't.",48863,3
48863,I find them quite warm..,48863,3
48864,"The fabric was looser than that of other Sanuk sandals, making them feel too big.",48864,3
48865,"I'm  6'7"" fit and XL-3XL just don't fit me right  and I knew  the largest  size of 2XL wouldn't either  but I'm  a big superheroes fan and can wear it at home so I order it.",48865,3
48866,I ordered this in a size small and it was still huge.,48866,3
48867,I wish these shorts had been a little longer.,48867,3
48867,The fabric was nice.,48867,3
48867,I like the elastic waistband.,48867,3
48868,The lenses look nothing like they do online in real life.,48868,3
48869,"The top fit okay, but the skirt was far too small.",48869,3
48870,This would be very nice if it fit.,48870,3
48870,"The dress does not match the size chart, although the description says it has been resized.",48870,3
48870,The fabric and lace are nice quality.,48870,3
48870,"It was out of stock on Prime, so I had not option to order a size up.",48870,3
48870,The only fault I found was that the it bunched up where the zipper and the skirt met.,48870,3
48871,Year one no problem where comfortable but a little cloudy.,48871,3
48871,Not clear enough to be safe for driving.,48871,3
48871,For the pool or a ball game.,48871,3
48871,"Year two, They broke.",48871,3
48871,If I remember right they were very inexpensive .,48871,3
48872,Sleeve cuffs had to be altered so the sleeves didn't fall below the wrist.,48872,3
48872,Good thing I could alter the sleeves.,48872,3
48872,We liked the heaviness of the fabric for winter wear.,48872,3
48873,Seems true to size.,48873,3
48875,Cute but was a waste of money wouldn't do right.,48875,3
48876,"This is not stretchable but it's okay, very shiny and the heart adds another dimension of beauty and rarity to a standard anklet.",48876,3
48876,I have not given it to anyone yet.,48876,3
48876,"I am saving it for another occasion, and it is a little better than two other anklets I ordered.",48876,3
48877,"It's cute, but the material is not the best.",48877,3
48877,Feels like I'm wearing a plastic bag,48877,3
48878,"XL usually fits me,but this XL ran a little smaller.",48878,3
48878,I was still  able to wear it as long as I didn't have to lift my arms over my head.,48878,3
48879,I should have stuck with my size M. I ordered a large.,48879,3
48880,It wasn't the quality as I expected,48880,3
48881,Fit was to tight in the waste,48881,3
48882,"Too small, I ordered a large had to send back and order an XL.",48882,3
48882,"I am a size 4, 34C.",48882,3
48882,"The bottoms were extremely small, like for a small child",48882,3
48885,order one size up,48885,3
48887,"I am 5'9"" and the straps do not reach my shoulders.",48887,3
48887,Nice jumpsuit but I would not recommend to any taller women.,48887,3
48888,Its beautiful not what is in the picture but still love it,48888,3
48889,I own a few of these types of panels and this one is very dim compared to the others.,48889,3
48889,If there is any light at all it takes the effect away.,48889,3
48890,they look cool but the frame is really thin and cheap!,48890,3
48890,Definitely not one of their better sunglasses.,48890,3
48891,Good quality but the size chart is not accurate.,48891,3
48891,I'm a 36DD which would be a L or XL according the chart.,48891,3
48891,I ordered L and it was huge.,48891,3
48892,Great gag gift back when the whole idea was still funny.,48892,3
48893,"Love the suit, but it runs super small!!",48893,3
48893,"I was able get a credit for the suit in a very timely manner, though.",48893,3
48894,The umbrella was exactly the one we had on mind and wanted.,48894,3
48894,"BUT when we received it, it was covered in dust.",48894,3
48894,"The outside of the umbrella, and the inside.",48894,3
48894,I had to take multiple paper towels with soap and water to remove the film of dust before letting my son touch it.,48894,3
48895,Decent sunglasses but the one I received had manufacturing defect therefore I returned it.,48895,3
48896,The denim is thin.,48896,3
48896,Not any of my other rock revival jeans feel this cheap.,48896,3
48896,Makes me think this pair might be knock off.,48896,3
48897,I love the design itself however I'm not loving the material at all.,48897,3
48897,It's overall a good purchase but it's extremely stretchy and the material feels like if it stretches too much it may never come back to its tru state....,48897,3
48897,I ordered a small and it still fit a lil big especially aroun the waist area but still loving it thou.,48897,3
48898,This dress runs small.,48898,3
48898,I ordered a small at first and was too too small and the medium fits okay but a little snug.,48898,3
48899,"Shirt material is nothing special,  fits as expected.",48899,3
48900,It's a nice dress/shirt but do make sure you take into account the sizes are much smaller than expected,48900,3
48901,"Was not true to size, the seams were off, I returned.",48901,3
48901,Was a fast delivery and had no problems requesting a return.,48901,3
48902,Material is soft but the elbow pads do not align with your elbows..,48902,3
48903,It's small on my husband but we've got it too closed to Christmas and have no time to get something larger.. so he only wore it the morning of Christmas... otherwise good material...,48903,3
48905,My son is picky and he actually like this denim jacket.,48905,3
48905,3 stars only because the buttons to connect the hood to the jacket is kinda flimsy but for the price its cool I guess,48905,3
48906,"I bought this jumpsuit having a returned prior similar purchase, but in a Medium size.",48906,3
48906,"The medium size was made of great material, just a little too tight, so I figured the Large would fit perfectly.",48906,3
48906,"Well, it did not.",48906,3
48906,"It fit exactly as the Medium, and the material was worse (thinner and did not leave me feeling decent at all).",48906,3
48907,"I ordered an XL and it fits more like a Large, but certainly doesn't look like the picture.",48907,3
48907,It comes to my waist and isn't roomy/big like the picture.,48907,3
48908,smaller than your average x-large,48908,3
48910,wasn't impressed with the quality,48910,3
48911,Washed and shrank In the wash,48911,3
48912,"These earring backs are very small, much smaller than they look in the description picture.",48912,3
48913,Fits great everywhere but across the chest and I'm only a 34A.,48913,3
48914,I like the style and how light this bag is.,48914,3
48914,It's smaller than i thought.,48914,3
48915,"Didn't look exactly like I would have wanted, still have to get in altered but pretty",48915,3
48916,This is great for someone with a long torso and maybe a B-Cup.,48916,3
48916,"If you have a short torso and Ds, don't bother.",48916,3
48916,Otherwise it is a nice suit.,48916,3
48917,Super cute but soooo tiny.,48917,3
48917,If you have any calves at all I wouldn't recommend them.,48917,3
48917,They would be great for very slim legs or young girls,48917,3
48918,I ordered the right size but.... Now it's sitting on a table.,48918,3
48919,"Order from chart and from reviews, I order a medium, way too big.",48919,3
48919,"Luckily I can sew, have to take it up inch and a half in the shoulders.",48919,3
48919,Fabric is good and quality made.,48919,3
48920,"rose gold color"""""" fadeing""""""",48920,3
48921,Ok but leather is kind of stiff; hard to get cards in and out.,48921,3
48921,Multiple compartments are nice.,48921,3
48922,"Nicely made, pattern is just too loud for me.",48922,3
48924,Smaller than I expected but still cute!,48924,3
48925,I know they weren't expensive but they broke the first time I cleaned the lenses the break was at the point the lenses attach to the frames.,48925,3
48925,Spend a little more and get s pair that won't break.,48925,3
48926,"its hard to zip up but once zipped works great, only thing is its more like a dark blue",48926,3
48927,I like the watch,48927,3
48928,A little small in the neck area,48928,3
48929,Very comfortable but I would buy a size larger than you think you need.,48929,3
48930,I was so sad to discover this dress isn't as tight as I hoped it would be.,48930,3
48930,I'm usually an extra small tho so it wasn't such a big surprise.,48930,3
48930,"The dress is quite loose on me but it still looks fine, I gave it away to my sister tho since she fits it better!",48930,3
48930,the material is great tho and it looks amazing on her.,48930,3
48930,Wish they had an xs.,48930,3
48931,"I am only 5' and the dress was a bit longer than tea length,  The size 14 fit was good in the bust (36M cup)and arms, but was baggy in the back between the shoulders.",48931,3
48931,Seemed to be good quality sewing.,48931,3
48931,The nursing panel was a bit small to pull off to the side as shown.,48931,3
48932,Works ok for the need I have.,48932,3
48933,"This dress is not the color that is pictured, nor is it the material or cut shown.",48933,3
48933,"Buyers should note that the color is a much lighter pink, not the fuchsia pictured.",48933,3
48933,"The fabric is a thin, non-stretch.",48933,3
48933,The belt does not have any interior structure or support.,48933,3
48933,The skirt is a slim a-line style and is not the circle skirt that it appears to be.,48933,3
48933,"While it did look decent on and fit properly, it was not right for my needs.",48933,3
48933,The company selling the dress was very understanding and easily returned my purchase for a full refund.,48933,3
48935,The skirt was very short and the sleeves were short it is cute but not sized correctly,48935,3
48936,"This is super cute, but unfortunately the size chart is WAY off.",48936,3
48936,"I usually fit into a med/large or large, but according to the size chart I needed to order an XL and even at that the top wasn't long enough and was VERY tight fitting, it barely covered my bottom half like it does in the picture.",48936,3
48936,I am returning the product and probably won't be getting this in another size.,48936,3
48936,"The top, too, has an inside ""bra"" but it really scrunches up at the top making the top look like you don't have it on right.",48936,3
48936,It's probably very cute if you are a Barbie doll size.,48936,3
48937,It is very comfortable but the cut was not what I expected.,48937,3
48938,"Cute, but discolors in the salt water.",48938,3
48938,"So, really only good for one day in the water.",48938,3
48939,This outfit was SUPER cute but WAY to small.,48939,3
48939,"I believe I ordered a Large, it fit like an extra small.",48939,3
48939,I ended up selling it to a friend of mine.,48939,3
48940,This is see through.... not cotton...,48940,3
48940,I want to return I don't feel it is the same as advertised.,48940,3
48940,Unless you are going to wear it over a swimsuit don't bother,48940,3
48942,My wife likes the socks they are cute.,48942,3
48942,Would be better if you could pick the colors we got 2 prs of the same color.,48942,3
48942,"They fit good and are comfortable, but one pair was unraveling at the toe seam.",48942,3
48942,They did arrive over a week early and are worth the price that you pay from them.,48942,3
48943,"The fit was perfect; however, the pants are too see through for my tastes.",48943,3
48943,I had to wear thick opaque tights underneath to help keep it from being too see through.,48943,3
48944,My main issue is that it was rather small.,48944,3
48944,"As a mom, I can't seem to get away from those giant purses that carry EVERYTHING!",48944,3
48944,:) Neat look though.,48944,3
48945,I like the size of these but the red stone fell out of the flower while I was removing it from the package.,48945,3
48945,I glued it back in but worry the others will fall out just as easily.,48945,3
48946,Nothing special material poor,48946,3
48947,Real pretty but a little too sheer for me,48947,3
48948,teenager will like and if she wants to beKhaleesi or a dragon goes well,48948,3
48949,"It looks so much better in the pictures, in person it looks more like a table cloth made into a dress.",48949,3
48949,Stiches are really cheap.,48949,3
48950,"Better quality then some of the others, but for the price, can't beat it.",48950,3
48951,Would have been perfect if it was sold in separates but the sizing is way off.,48951,3
48951,I'm usually a Medium in most swimsuits but I went with the reviews and ordered a size up.,48951,3
48951,"The top, even with the padding left in, is far too big but the bottoms are far too small and fit me more like an extra small would.",48951,3
48951,Pretty bummed because the suit is super cute otherwise.,48951,3
48952,Got then for the wife.,48952,3
48953,Pleats are hard to get ironed nicely.,48953,3
48954,I originally got one of these from daiso and loved it.,48954,3
48954,"But they stopped selling it, so I looked online.",48954,3
48954,"This one does what I need it to, but it doesn't stay in the lifted position as well as my $2 daiso one.",48954,3
48954,"It keeps falling down over my face, so I have to keep pushing it back up.",48954,3
48955,"It is the same as the picture, but to me it appears to be off center a little.",48955,3
48955,"I was going to give it as a gift, along with the Matthew 17:20 necklace, but changed my mind and will keep it and get a different mustard seed necklace.",48955,3
48956,I have mixed feelings about this dress.,48956,3
48956,"My mom and my friend said it's pretty, but I'm somewhat not convinced.",48956,3
48956,The detail is gorgeous but I'm just not head over heels in love with this.,48956,3
48956,Oh and it does run big.,48956,3
48957,"The center stone color is more green than aqua, the side gems are aqua.",48957,3
48957,"The fit is good and overall it is a nice ring, although my ring chipped within the first week I had it.",48957,3
48957,It is a fairly large chip.,48957,3
48957,The black stainless is nice.,48957,3
48957,The shipping was prompt.,48957,3
48958,Does an OK job at keeping pants up.,48958,3
48958,Better job of providing extra support for the bump when also wearing a dress.,48958,3
48960,Im petite woman and it was a little bigger around the breats,48960,3
48961,They fit as expected and are comfortable.,48961,3
48961,The legs roll up on me but it isn't that much of an inconvenience.,48961,3
48961,"I did, however, find that one pair of another color line (striped blue and green) had a hole in the crotch area.",48961,3
48961,"I suppose one being bad out of the couple packs I bought isn't too bad, but it was quite disappointing to find.",48961,3
48962,I was disappointed with these gems.,48962,3
48962,The screw backs were cumbersome and took a good deal of twisting to get them secure.,48962,3
48962,The fine threads didn't look like they would hold up over time.,48962,3
48962,I thought the stones were undersized compared to another 1/2 CW diamond my wife had.,48962,3
48962,"The ad did state that these were in a range in size ""from x to x"".",48962,3
48962,I returned them to the seller and they promptly refunded my money.,48962,3
48962,So I would trust them for another transaction in the future if I saw something I liked.,48962,3
48963,"Quality isn't amazing, not see-through if you are on the smaller, thinner side.",48963,3
48963,"Be careful, don't dry these in the dryer.",48963,3
48964,"I am keeping it, but the XL top is a bit small for my 36DD size.",48964,3
48964,"The bottoms fit my 41"" waist but are not super loose, so remember this if ordering.",48964,3
48965,"It's really cute, but it has it's problems.",48965,3
48965,"The fabric is sheer, the sizing chart is not accurate.",48965,3
48966,Dont keep a good charge,48966,3
48968,It's not bad for the price,48968,3
48970,Expected the size of the rim to be bigger.,48970,3
48970,"But overall, very nice glasses.",48970,3
48970,Came in a secure packaging.,48970,3
48970,I would order again in the future.,48970,3
48971,I like the gold in the lease but what I do not recommend is for someone to say that this is a one size fits all I am a size typically small to a medium and it did fit me a little bit they were had to make some adjustments,48971,3
48972,"hard to get in but, it's fine.",48972,3
48973,those  Armstrong small,48973,3
48974,(Had to give it away.,48974,3
48974,Too small) orginal comment.,48974,3
48974,I was approached by the owner.,48974,3
48974,I decided to give this product a constructive criticism.,48974,3
48974,"First, read other reviews, and if you still want to go with the product,  order twice a size and half to what you normally wear.",48974,3
48975,It did not fit as I expected,48975,3
48976,"Quality wallet; however, too small, minimalist to the max.",48976,3
48976,I wish Bellroy would make a larger capacity leather billfold with a zipper and the lovely owl emblem.,48976,3
48977,"The reviews I read before purchasing this hat said it was a little stiff , but when I received the hat it was really stiff so I almost sent it back.",48977,3
48977,After working with it awhile it can be softened up and shaped nicely.,48977,3
48978,Girlfriend likes these but i don't think she liked the lucky dots design.,48978,3
48979,Not quite what I was expecting.,48979,3
48979,It's not awful but I'm not to keen on it.,48979,3
48979,"I'm thinking of removing the chains, replacing it with two pins and giving it to my 5 year old Grandson as a medal.",48979,3
48980,It's ok. Really a dark gray than what is shown in the picture.,48980,3
48981,It came with no label or care instructions.,48981,3
48981,It also smelled very strange - not like the regular sizing smell.,48981,3
48982,"Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful scarf for a very good price.",48982,3
48982,"But, I had intended to use it for a chapel veil and the two points that would hang forward are very long and thin, which make it look kind of weird for my purpose.",48982,3
48982,I will try to make some kind of adjustment because it is too beautiful to just sit in a drawer.,48982,3
48983,"Very cute, but the sewing is TERRIBLE.",48983,3
48983,"The strap busted by pulling them up, the only time I wore them, and I'm extra small.",48983,3
48983,"There's no reason for it, besides poor quality, but it was cheap!!",48983,3
48983,I got what I paid for.,48983,3
48983,"Easy repair, if you have the patience.",48983,3
48985,"VERY CUTE SOFT AND FUN, ITS JUST TOO SMALL",48985,3
48986,Bought these for my 10 year old daughter.,48986,3
48986,She wore one for less than 2 weeks and it broke.,48986,3
48986,"But, what to expect from plastic.",48986,3
48987,This product was fine after a couple of weeks it didn't stick or hold like it did.,48987,3
48987,When I first wore it it lasted throughout the whole day.,48987,3
48987,Idk if it stopped working because I wouldn't put the plastic wraps back on after i took it off but after a while it didn't hold up like it used to.,48987,3
48988,Very small even though I ordered 2 sizes up.,48988,3
48988,Still waiting to see if I can return.,48988,3
48989,The color is not the same as on the photos.,48989,3
48989,"It is kind of ugly, to be honest!",48989,3
48990,I'm a 34D got size large too small,48990,3
48991,The fit was too small even after moving up two sizes.,48991,3
48991,It also had a slight irregular defect that i was able to repair.,48991,3
48991,If I lose 10 lbs it will fit better.,48991,3
48992,The shoes are nice and comfy for my son but I did not get them in time for our vacation in Colorado.,48992,3
48992,I ended up buying him shoes from Academy that served the purpose just fine.,48992,3
48992,I was going to return these shoes but they don't offer free return shipping and shipping to China is same price as the shoes.,48992,3
48992,I should have checked the shipping and return carefully.,48992,3
48992,Now I decided to keep them and pass them on to my nephews.,48992,3
48992,These will not fit my son next year and our weather in Houston is too warm to even wear these in winter.,48992,3
48994,It's a bit disproportionate.,48994,3
48994,There's no button to hold it together and it doesn't quite look like the advertised photo.,48994,3
48994,We tried to give it as a gift - no one would have it.,48994,3
48995,This is a pretty nice wallet.,48995,3
48995,The only downside is that the ID slot doesn't hold your ID securely.,48995,3
48995,The wallets ability to block RFID scanning is questionable as I have many key cards for building access that work without removing them from the wallet.,48995,3
48995,"Having said all this, for the price its a good minimalist wallet.",48995,3
48996,Runs a little small it's a lightweight hoodie nice color wish it was a little heavier material,48996,3
48997,Dress was cute but it ran really small so I had to return.,48997,3
48998,"looks exactly like the picture but the hanging strings are very unorganized and some were missing beads and the fit seemed a little funkey around my breasts, otherwise very comfy!",48998,3
48999,I like the dress.,48999,3
48999,But I need to wear it as a shirt.,48999,3
49000,I was too small where the elastic was,49000,3
49002,The clock is exactly like it shows in the picture.,49002,3
49002,i didn't notice how hard it is to see the hands when I bought it.,49002,3
49002,It doesn't have numbers either.,49002,3
49002,But it came when it was supposed to and keeps time well.,49002,3
49003,"Maybe it's the fabric, but I felt things a little tight.",49003,3
49004,You can really see through yellow dress.,49004,3
49005,Pockets are angled awkward.,49005,3
49006,"Nice style, but the yellow was VERY neon greenish-yellow.",49006,3
49006,"I needed something of a banana color, so I had to send it back.",49006,3
49007,Cute but the case is peeling apart,49007,3
49008,These pants are super cute but fit kind of snug and to top it off the zipper broke.,49008,3
49009,"Not what the picture shows- the shirt is very cute, but it is not cut the same as the shirt in the picture.",49009,3
49009,"The one I received the torso length is very short, so much so that my skin shows on the sides where it is tailored to make the material scoop down in front and back.",49009,3
49009,"And back hymn barely come down over the waist of my jeans,  Im an average height, 5'7"".",49009,3
49009,The only way I am able to wear it is with a camisole underneath.,49009,3
49009,"Super soft, good quality silk screen.",49009,3
49010,Butt is unraveling from shorts but was the hit of the party for Halloween 2015,49010,3
49011,The color is more of blue grey than blue.,49011,3
49011,I put it right on the bed (first mistake).,49011,3
49011,The coverage is good but it certainly doesn't puddle on the floor.,49011,3
49011,"In the middle of the night, I woke up with a huge allergy attack.",49011,3
49011,"This isn't normal for me,but I should have washed it.",49011,3
49011,I have an allergen cycle on my washer so in it went.,49011,3
49011,90 minutes later I loaded it into the dryer after I removed gobs of chenille from the machine.,49011,3
49011,2 complete cycles of both washer and dryer before it seems to have quit shedding.,49011,3
49011,Its still not soft but I hope it will do.,49011,3
49012,I do like it.,49012,3
49012,"It was what I expected, but the gold coloring is already  wearing off of the metal.",49012,3
49013,Ordered a size up and fit perfect.,49013,3
49013,The lime green bottoms were a little thin and see thru when wet.,49013,3
49014,"Looks like they're nicely-made (time will tell), but not ""slouchy"" (baggy) as I would have expected, especially since the word is used in the description.",49014,3
49014,"I like the colors, though.",49014,3
49014,"Also: The outside brand tag is in an odd place respective to the seam, so if you want the tag squarely in the front or back when wearing it, the fit is quite off.",49014,3
49014,Would I buy it again?,49014,3
49014,"Well, the price is okay for what it is  but the disappointment factor is fairly high; if the seam were right and they were baggy, this would be a bargain.",49014,3
49014,This really would be a two-and-a-half star review if I could do it.,49014,3
49015,"This swimsuit is pretty, I like that the bottom covers more than most.",49015,3
49015,"However, I am a DDD and have a hard time finding swimsuits that cover me up top.",49015,3
49015,I've adjusted the straps and don't really like the top.,49015,3
49015,The cups don't extend down low enough so when I tightened the straps the cups were higher than my breasts and when loosened the cups didn't give enough support.,49015,3
49015,"I am 5'0"" 190lbs.",49015,3
49015,I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.,49015,3
49017,Son has a hard time slipping it on.,49017,3
49018,It's adorable and great quality but it's Asian sizing so it runs small.,49018,3
49019,a little small for the size I selected,49019,3
49020,It was too small,49020,3
49021,Shoulders are a little small but overall I'm happy,49021,3
49022,"The colors are great and it looks pretty, but I wouldn't buy it again unless I lost a decent amount of weight.",49022,3
49022,"I mean, I can get in it, but it isn't super comfortable.",49022,3
49022,I would say if you wear a small or are on the small side of a medium this would be nice.,49022,3
49022,I'm a 34 b with a 29 in waist.,49022,3
49022,"Anyway, I can get in it, but I think it would look nicer if it was like a half inch bigger.",49022,3
49022,Haven't worn it out... might in the winter with a jacket.,49022,3
49022,Really wish you could choose sizes.,49022,3
49023,"I ordered large, but should have ordered x-large, otherwise the quality is good, makes a great coffee strainer",49023,3
49024,Order a size bigger,49024,3
49025,fell apart after wear a dozen times,49025,3
49026,"First off, if you have toned thighs and buttocks, this product doesn't really do much for ya.",49026,3
49026,I ordered this to wear under my dress for my birthday.,49026,3
49026,"I'm 5'4"", 175lbs, waist measures About 38"" at my navel.",49026,3
49026,I ordered the XL/2XL according to the size chart.,49026,3
49026,It slid on with relative ease but did nothing to smooth out anything.,49026,3
49026,I actually need a size smaller.,49026,3
49026,"The waist cinching portion also doesnt come down far enough, so if you have lower abdominal pooch AND a back rolls, it can't get it all.",49026,3
49026,"Additionally, I have really toned legs and butt, I just thought this mighy give me a more rounded look because I wish I had more volume towards the top of my bum to give a little more curve.",49026,3
49026,This product just wasn't for me.,49026,3
49027,The only bad thing about this swimsuit was that it's for someone with a very short torso also small chested.,49027,3
49027,Other than that it was super cute and good material!,49027,3
49028,I love this dress but I is too small in the bust and the underskirt is too short.,49028,3
49028,I had side panels put in so it would fit my bust and hips.,49028,3
49030,"Very cute, however, material is very thin.",49030,3
49030,"The top does not fit well and does not have any support, I am larger at the bottom than top so I did still give it 3 stars.",49030,3
49030,"This issue is easily fixed with a nude or coordinating sports bra, and is good for show but I wouldn't recommend actually swimming in it...or getting it wet.",49030,3
49030,I am 5'0'' approx 150 lbs pear shaped.,49030,3
49032,Man I had a hard decision to make about this top- should it be a 3 or a 4?,49032,3
49032,"Well, I went with a 3- but let me tell you, if I was rating it wearing it backwards it would be a 4.",49032,3
49032,"Yes, I realize how weird that sounds- but I got the pink one, and the liner isn't substantial enough to prevent bra show through EXCEPT, if you put it on backwards the floral pattern is on top, and does sufficiently obscure the bra.",49032,3
49032,"IMO, its cuter that way too.",49032,3
49032,I first put it on backwards by mistake.,49032,3
49032,"I liked it but was thinking, the print isn't going to be the same as you saw on the website (floral on bottom).",49032,3
49032,That is when I realized I had it on backwards (oops) and flipped it around.,49032,3
49032,"Ok now it's just like online, but I don't like it as much because I have to be way more careful about what I put on under it.",49032,3
49032,"Being polyester, despite its very thin wispy nature, it seems to retain heat.",49032,3
49032,"It's not as cool as a normal tank top, temperature wise.",49032,3
49032,"Honestly, there isn't really a difference in shape front to back that I can tell, and I'll probably just wear it backwards!",49032,3
49032,"I still wouldn't have given it a 5, because the liner isn't nearly as long as it should be in my opinion.",49032,3
49032,"I don't like the early end leaving part see through, I know it's a fashion choice, but I just don't like it.",49032,3
49032,I think it would look prettier if more consistent throughout the length.,49032,3
49032,"Like most clothes in this price range and especially of this cloth type, I worry about durability.",49032,3
49032,Hand wash or get a very fine mesh lingerie bag for best results.,49032,3
49032,"Now on size- I think I'm a little smaller than the target market for this shirt (description says Medium to Large, I'm a size 4, 32C) but it fits me OK, it's not way too big but it is a little wide on the torso, a hair wider than the style is designed to be.",49032,3
49032,"Now realistically, I worry for anyone with thick arms that this will be a bad choice.",49032,3
49032,I have very thin arms and have about an inch and a half or two to spare and there isn't really any give to them.,49032,3
49032,"No stretch, either it'll fit comfortably or it won't at all.",49032,3
49032,"I see another reviewer, size 16 mentioned she liked the fit but in her photos you can see she's not utilizing the arm holes.",49032,3
49032,"I don't know if that was just that she didn't realize they were there or it did not fit comfortably, it's not addressed in her review.",49032,3
49032,"Just a heads up, because I also didn't notice them when I first put it on and there is a secondary area that feels like appropriate arm holes, The higher hole doesn't line up with the liner tank top so its easy to overlook when you put it on.",49032,3
49032,I was going to complain that the beautiful draping is actually in the way of getting anything done.,49032,3
49032,"If you don't use the arm holes and use this secondary area, the shirt drapes over your hands, making cooking or eating in this shirt near impossible, not to mention you'd have a hell of a time in the restroom!",49032,3
49032,You want those higher arm holes to work for you unless you intend to stand pretty still all day.,49032,3
49032,"Also, unless you are a sewing guru, it's going to look a little odd to have two stitched holes at about the height of your elbow just hanging out.",49032,3
49032,"I received a sample in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.",49032,3
49033,No even close to the size.,49033,3
49033,you need to get at least 2 sizes bigger for it to fit properlu,49033,3
49034,"It is fleece, not cotton terry cloth.",49034,3
49034,"If you like fleece, its great.",49034,3
49035,"Not what I expected, doesn't look or have the weight of silver.",49035,3
49035,The shine is different looks more of and alloy mixed with silver.,49035,3
49035,"It doesn't look like the picture, setting of it is right.",49035,3
49035,But just doesn't look like silver,49035,3
49036,I love this bathing suit but... the top has no support or padding at all.,49036,3
49036,I wear another strapless top under it to add a little support and coverage.,49036,3
49036,"Overall though, I love the fit and the fact that's a little baggy.",49036,3
49036,The bottom part has good coverage and is super cute.,49036,3
49038,"Returned them because small in the waist, and large in the hips and thighs.",49038,3
49039,The neck strap is to short making it uncomfortable to wear.,49039,3
49039,My granddaughter is a bean pole so that only leaves the straps are cut to short.,49039,3
49040,"Bought it for a 7 year old girl, took a long time to arrive and was hard for her to open and close, but easy for an adult .",49040,3
49040,"Very nice looking in person, a nice silky fabric.",49040,3
49041,too small around the waist,49041,3
49043,"Top is ok, bottoms way to small",49043,3
49044,The material on the tie is cheap.,49044,3
49044,But the shirt is good and fits as expected.,49044,3
49045,I don't like the fabric.,49045,3
49045,I assume I should have checked the material before purchasing.,49045,3
49045,It has a polly-rayon-lycria feel to it.,49045,3
49045,With a bit of a shine it comes off as cheap looking.,49045,3
49045,I expected a softer feel and look from the picture.,49045,3
49045,Also the sleeves aren't as long as the picture either.,49045,3
49046,Keep in mind that this is just a costume to be worn one night.,49046,3
49046,I had fun and everyone enjoyed it but...,49046,3
49046,The skirt is very thin and see through.,49046,3
49046,Wear some nylons with white boy shorts.,49046,3
49046,It is also very short so you will need to pull it down to your hips.,49046,3
49046,The top was a little big which was perfect since I had to pull the skirt down a touch.,49046,3
49046,I am 5'3 165 lbs.,49046,3
49047,"it looks great, but to tends to ""slip"" and loosen up",49047,3
49048,"It is ok and will do, I guess, although I bought and paid for 14kt white gold and received 10kt with no explanation.",49048,3
49048,Clearly a cheaper version of what I ordered.,49048,3
49048,I don't like paying a higher price for a cheaper version.,49048,3
49049,"it said 'one size fits all', but it's too small for me.",49049,3
49049,Product is OK--just too small,49049,3
49050,very cute but to small to tell what they are,49050,3
49051,It's a nice dress,49051,3
49052,This is a very nice wallet.,49052,3
49052,"The clasp is good, looks sharp, and it's very easy to access your cards because each one fits into it's own separate sleeve.",49052,3
49052,When you open it up they all accordion out for easy access.,49052,3
49052,UPDATED:  After using this wallet for a few months the sleeves are starting to break.,49052,3
49052,The plastic is pretty weak on the edges and once the sleeves rip all you have left is basically a stack of cards in a box.,49052,3
49053,I like the gown so I am going to keep it.,49053,3
49053,But it is too tight through the hips for it to be a true woman's size.,49053,3
49054,Shoes looked great but too narrow for most feet.,49054,3
49055,Plastic gems but nice.,49055,3
49056,"It's an good wallet a little loose at the the ID window, and stays open a little too much at center pocket but still a good wallet.",49056,3
49057,"While a very nice tote, I wanted something at least 12"" in length.",49057,3
49057,"While the on-line said it was this long, the base is actually only 10"" and so I returned it.",49057,3
49059,I did not liked the quality,49059,3
49060,The top is nice but runs small in size.,49060,3
49060,I would suggest ordering a size larger than you normally wear.,49060,3
49061,the fabric is some transparent,49061,3
49062,"The denim material looks a little cheap, but the fit and style are very cute.",49062,3
49062,"I am 5'2"", 130 lbs and ordered a medium, but could have went with a small since the back does stretch.",49062,3
49062,"As a result, I have some ruching in the back, but still very cute and it fits well.",49062,3
49062,"I would not recommend this dress for someone taller because it truly is mini and may look more like a shirt on anyone taller than 5'4.""",49062,3
49062,The v-cut is low but covers my bust and I am a 34DDD.,49062,3
49063,Cut short and its made from tee shirt material not of great quality.,49063,3
49064,The lenses aren't as dark as I thought they would be.,49064,3
49065,"The material on the outside dents easily, but it does its job.",49065,3
49066,They are well made but on me they were just too loose for the pool.,49066,3
49066,I'm short and I felt they came down too far on me.,49066,3
49066,But it's more about my body than the shorts.,49066,3
49066,The shorts were exactly as advertised.,49066,3
49068,Too short...not a maxi.,49068,3
49069,It was too large for me.,49069,3
49069,I bought it xxl because of the reviews but with an xl would be perfect.,49069,3
49069,Insted of i will sent it to sew to try to fix for my Body because it's beautiful,49069,3
49070,"These were probably fine for someone with a normal width foot, mine seems to be too narrow for the crocs interior width.",49070,3
49070,The lining was soft and classy looking.,49070,3
49071,The dress itself is very pretty (especially for the price).,49071,3
49071,"I wear a size 12 and ordered a ""large"" (according to the size chart), but the dress that came was more like a size 8.",49071,3
49071,"I would order two times larger, if I were you.",49071,3
49071,"I need to return, but there seems to be issues with the seller on returns, so I'm not happy.",49071,3
49071,"(The battle for ""returns"" is not over yet, I may have to take it up with Amazon.)",49071,3
49072,The material is not very forgiving.,49072,3
49072,I thought it looked like it would be flow-y and comfortable but it is more tight fitting.,49072,3
49073,But the diamonds are easy to loose and hard to screw in.,49073,3
49073,I'm missing a set of diamonds,49073,3
49074,I typically get a size M for all my clothes.,49074,3
49074,"Due to the reviews and according to my measurements, I bought the XL which was WAY too big.",49074,3
49074,Unfortunately I can't return it because I'd have to pay $35 for it to be shipped in time.,49074,3
49074,I'm going to pay to get it altered.,49074,3
49075,Its comfortable to use daily.,49075,3
49075,I do not use the telescopic pole very much.,49075,3
49075,Makes putting on shoes very easy.,49075,3
49075,Especially when your overweight!,49075,3
49076,"The vest looks awesome the tie as well
I'm 5' 10"" muscular build  and weigh 160 the vest was way too big and I got a medium",49076,3

49077,"Otherwise, good for the price.",49077,3
49078,bit little tighter and the fabric was so thin.,49078,3
49079,"Pants felt comfy, but too small.",49079,3
49080,"Awesome little wallet, but didn't test well for rfid protection",49080,3
49081,I think the product is cheaply made but I got what I paid for.,49081,3
49081,I was going to return it but it end up having a cute oversize style to it.,49081,3
49081,I just know I can't wash it too rough.,49081,3
49082,"I Really Liked This Shirt, It's Unfortunate That It Was Too Tight.",49082,3
49083,"A little sheer and small, but did what I needed it to do.",49083,3
49085,In reality a xxl is much too big for me but in this case I guess I need a 3xl or bigger ...idk....good quality;  just the measurements were a bit off.,49085,3
49086,"The material is VERY sheer, and the inner lining is so short that if you're tall or have a bigger butt, it'll be basically indecent.",49086,3
49086,Worn with tights it's adorable.,49086,3
49087,Cheaply made and too small,49087,3
49088,"I like the shirt a lot, its just a little short i have to wear an undershirt so baby bump doesn't hang out at the bottom.",49088,3
49089,"It's so beautiful, but it broke the second I set in on my head.",49089,3
49089,And I just set it on my head to see what it looked like.,49089,3
49089,Didn't even put it on like a headband.,49089,3
49089,Very sad about it actually.,49089,3
49090,very disappointed since I ordered they largest size offered and it was still too tight on the jacket portion.,49090,3
49091,Seller did a good job however!,49091,3
49092,"i accidently rated this item I haven' received yet, but I received the ties yesterday - and it's awesome.",49092,3
49093,"I love this as a sun safety product, but it's not strong.",49093,3
49093,The sleeve ripped after just 2 wears in a sprinkler park.,49093,3
49094,Good looking boot too small,49094,3
49095,With a little adjusting they fit okay.,49095,3
49095,I have toned thighs so they struggled to squeeze in.,49095,3

49097,"And the alien was not weapon and its like a picture, But I still liked this shirt.",49097,3
49097,but this shirt was kind of small for me because I ordered Medium/Large and the shirt stops at right above below the belly button.,49097,3
49099,It was supossed to be size US 10/12 ....,49099,3
49100,"Color's off, and it's definitely not silk.",49100,3
49100,Debating whether I should return it.,49100,3
49101,Looks good but it fits too snug.,49101,3
49101,Should have been more careful - other reviews warned of the sizing.,49101,3
49101,Just order one size larger.,49101,3
49102,The pads for the breast are too big.,49102,3
49102,It comes out too far and it makes the top area look really bulky.,49102,3
49102,The dress looks like the picture.,49102,3
49102,This dress is best suited for the size of the female in the picture anything bigger the dress will not be as great.,49102,3
49103,The sizing chart the provide is wrong.,49103,3
49103,I followed their suggestions and ordered a 3 XL but it was HUGE.,49103,3
49103,I'm pretty sure they are fit according to regular US sizing so please order accordingly.,49103,3
49104,Looks nice but the material is very cheap.,49104,3
49104,I had to wear a tight.,49104,3
49104,because you could easily see everything under.,49104,3
49105,Such a cute little charm.,49105,3
49105,"Unfortunately, the silver color rubbed off of the raised surfaces within two weeks.",49105,3
49107,"The bathing suit is a lovely color, but for a woman with breast over a b cup it absolutely has no support.",49107,3
49108,Went to their website to find my size.,49108,3
49108,I ordered the size it told me to but it was a little big.,49108,3
49108,I wore it pretty frequently but honestly don't think it did much.,49108,3
49108,I think the body healed itself really.,49108,3
49109,This necklace is not very durable.,49109,3
49109,"In fact, it should be handled gently.",49109,3
49110,I'm a Medium and a tru size 8; I order de Large and the pants were to tight but the jacket/t-shirt was big,49110,3
49111,"Very soft, was used as a Max from Where the Wild Things Are Costume and he enjoys wearing it very much.",49111,3
49111,"Not a huge fan of the yellow around the sleeves, both otherwise is nice quality.",49111,3
49111,Edit: after a month or so this thing started coming apart at the seems all over.,49111,3
49111,"He slept in it, so no rough housing it in.",49111,3
49112,not as long to the ankles as pictured or advertised.,49112,3
49112,"unless you're short or with a shorter inseam than a 32, it may fit as shown.",49112,3
49112,kind of slides off of my waist so I had to keep pulling it up while exercising.,49112,3
49112,"otherwise, held sweat fairly well for the workout I did and received a lot of compliments on the cool color and print.",49112,3
49113,"This thing looks cool, but it is a hassel to get on, a hassel to get off, and once one of the straps is twisted... good luck.",49113,3
49114,Nice sock but a little too small.,49114,3
49114,The toes aren't wide enough to slip socks on easily,49114,3
49115,It's much thinner than it appeared.,49115,3
49115,"I ordered a XXL, but it fit like a medium.",49115,3
49115,Very small through the body and arms.,49115,3
49115,I will be returning it.,49115,3
49116,Cute dress if you have the right figure for it.,49116,3
49116,It was snug fitting but the slit killed it.,49116,3
49116,No way i could sit without putting my hoohaas on display!,49116,3
49117,"Most of the product looks great, but one of the 2 rods to hold the watch band in place has a manufacturing defect that prevents the rod from sitting flush with the watch end.",49117,3
49117,"It stays on okay, but it looks a little strange.",49117,3
49118,"I rate 3 stars only because of the quality, I could spend 15 dollars for something better for sure.",49118,3
49118,"Anyways , it fits good.",49118,3
49118,"I chose an M , I'm usually Small but I read it runs smaller so I chose one size up .",49118,3
49118,Hopefully I will use it for a long time.,49118,3
49119,Pros: Keeps your face warm.,49119,3
49119,Cons: Hard to breathe through.,49119,3
49120,I didn't get the hat I actually ordered so that's why I'm taking off one star.,49120,3
49120,If I had wanted the hat we actually purchased I would have given it 4 stars.,49120,3
49120,The ears are not in the same spot on the hat as the picture shows either.,49120,3
49120,It's very cute just not the color/animal I wanted.,49120,3
49120,It's super cozy and my daughter loves it anyway but I just wish I had gotten what I ordered :),49120,3
49121,Top part of dress is too short - unless you are high waisted!,49121,3
49122,"Really cute, but a little small and I ordered a xxl because I know that sometimes the Asian sizes run small, normally I wear a medium/Large.",49122,3
49123,"I ordered a size bigger than I would normally wear and it fits, but man, the amount of cleavage you see is - revealing.",49123,3
49123,I tried it with two separate bras (regular underwire and one push-up).,49123,3
49123,"Either way, I need some tape (the professional kind) if I ever try to wear this to work because a safety pin will NOT do the trick on this one.",49123,3
49123,"I have several dresses in this style that I have to pin, which is fine most of the time.",49123,3
49123,Hubby loves this dress!,49123,3
49123,Updated 9/31/16: I got a second dress in Olive Tahiti and it fits smaller than my first and I ordered the same size.,49123,3
49123,"Taking a second star off, also it is very see-through.",49123,3
49123,I was wearing underwear with a teal band and I could see it through the dress.,49123,3
49124,"Much shorter than the picture and smaller than I had hoped and I haven't washed it yet so this might be a ""wear once and give away""",49124,3
49125,Honestly I didn't even try this dress on.,49125,3
49125,I would have liked to but when it came and I opened the bag the smell of fish was so overwhelming I gagged.,49125,3
49125,Obviously it came over on a boat in a container with some foul smelling stuff and the stench has permeated the dress.,49125,3
49125,It's hard to review something I haven't actually put on but I did think it was important to make people aware of the possibility that your dress will have to be dry cleaned if it smells as bad as mine did although from the reviews it would appear that perhaps this isn't all that common.,49125,3
49125,So I'll give it 3 stars since I have no idea how it fits or even what it looks like in person as I didn't even pull the dress out of the bag - the smell was that bad.,49125,3
49125,It was disappointing to me that I couldn't even try the dress on.,49125,3
49125,I could order another but at this point I've already chosen another dress.,49125,3
49126,Great for the price they did rip easy had to buy more,49126,3
49127,The watch works but the hello kitty face was missing an eye.,49127,3
49127,I didn't want to bother to return it.,49127,3
49128,This product was to small and see through.,49128,3
49128,"The customer
Service however was really great and quick.",49128,3
49129,Make sure you order one size up.,49129,3
49129,Runs small in length.,49129,3
49130,"The fit was great however, the custom writing I ordered was incorrect, sent it back",49130,3
49132,"I don't have big thighs, so was shocked this was tight.",49132,3
49132,But it's cute and worked for my Harley Quinn/Marilyn Monroe 7 Year Itch mashup costume.,49132,3
49133,The top is great but the bottoms are WAY TOO SMALL.,49133,3
49133,You should be able to order two different sizes....,49133,3
49134,"This is a cute suit, and my daughter loves it.",49134,3
49134,"The quality is lacking, the material is very thin.",49134,3
49134,"We bought this for my daughter's Peppa themed swimming party so it will work, but I am not sure if she will be able to wear it again on account of the material being so thin.",49134,3

49138,The material comes apart pretty easily.,49138,3
49140,I ordered the item 9/2 and I just received it in the mail 12/1.,49140,3
49140,It's very form fitting but is a cute top.,49140,3
49140,It's a spandex silky material.,49140,3
49140,Very thin and not very stretchy.,49140,3
49140,It's a little see through but the top is very cute and it's definitely eye catching.,49140,3
49141,gave it to my mom ..my fault got confuse with the size,49141,3
49142,"Cute bag, The inside zipper ripped the first day but the bag itself is adorable and well made!",49142,3

49143,it's not itchy and it's comfortable so 3 stars,49143,3
49144,Super warm but really oversized.,49144,3
49144,They stick out on either side like Princess Leia of Star Wars..Will use them when shoveling snow.,49144,3
49145,"These are a cute idea, but they were a little large and it started de-threading on the top and bottom.",49145,3
49146,Love the name brand ...well made and a classic design .,49146,3
49146,But really meant for a smaller wrist .,49146,3
49146,I wear it but there is no movement .,49146,3
49146,It's good  for a couple hour outing but could not work all day in it.,49146,3
49146,At the 29.00 sale price I think that is still too high ...,49146,3
49146,Probably $ 12-15 might be more reasonable .,49146,3
49146,"You are paying for the "" southern"" classy lady label .",49146,3

49146,In Florida it's just another bracelet.,49146,3
49146,I'll keep it .,49146,3
49147,"My 8-year-old daughter picked this swimsuit out online, from a literal sea of girl's suits available on Amazon.",49147,3
49147,She was specifically looking for a top to go with her existing mermaid swimtail.,49147,3
49147,"She loves it, and the top does indeed match her existing tail, so she's as happy as can be.",49147,3
49147,"However, I did need to make several modifications to it.",49147,3
49147,We cut the bow off of the back of the bottoms and sewed the two triangle pieces together on the top so they didn't slide apart while she was swimming.,49147,3
49147,The cut of the suit is not particularly flattering but she doesn't notice!,49147,3
49147,The size chart was somewhat confusing because not all relevant measurements were listed but we went with the Large and it fits okay.,49147,3
49147,She is slender and the bottoms are still a bit loose.,49147,3
49147,"The fabric has a subtle scale print, which is pretty.",49147,3
49147,The top has a thin padding overall; some of the other reviews mentioned snipping it out but you would have to take apart a seam and sew it back together to remove it so we just left it in.,49147,3
49147,"It's not what I would consider womanly shaping, just a thin layer of padding to the entire triangle piece.",49147,3
49147,"Overall, my daughter loves it, I was luke-warm about it, the price was reasonable.",49147,3
49148,see thru but cute over something,49148,3
49149,"It lift my butt but ita a lil
 obvious",49149,3
49150,i received my bracelet about a week back...it looked beautiful and very dainty.,49150,3
49150,when i took it out of the packaging i noticed one of the blue stones was missing but i still kept it.,49150,3
49150,Since then several other blue stones have fallen off.,49150,3
49150,overall the bracelet is pretty but very flimsy.,49150,3
49151,The only downsides were that the rubber band around the otherwise nice gift box crushed it and the lable on the back of the tie was torn.,49151,3
49152,I bought this bracelet for myself and I loved it.,49152,3
49152,So cute and fit perfectly even though I do have small ankles.,49152,3
49152,however it did not hold up at all the quality was very disappointing.,49152,3
49152,I wore it for about four weeks and the metal connectors started to pop out I reattached two to three times until finally one of the two chains just broke and I had to throw it away.,49152,3
49152,no worth the money and disappointed in the making of this bracelet.,49152,3
49152,The shipping and packaging was very cute!,49152,3
49153,Very good for quick reading in sunlight.,49153,3
49153,"For me personally, the height of the lens does not cover enough of the eye area to wear full time as ""sunglasses""  - makes me squint too much.",49153,3
49153,Nice style and perfect transaction.,49153,3
49154,I have a small head for a female.,49154,3
49154,I expected these hats to be a bit more saggy in the back.,49154,3
49154,"But, I do like the hats.",49154,3
49155,"These are NOT women's sizes, they are Misses sizes so they run small!",49155,3
49155,I ordered an XL and it was too tight.,49155,3
49155,These should be advertised on Amazon as Misses sizes so larger older women understand that they are a different size category.,49155,3
49155,That said they are gorgeous and nicely made.,49155,3
49156,"It's a nice, small purse.",49156,3
49156,Suitable for a child.,49156,3
49157,Decent hat for the price.,49157,3
49158,Cute dress but I should have ordered a size up...i didn't know it was jersey material either.,49158,3
49158,I will order again but next time I'll order a size larger for the affect pictured...,49158,3
49159,It is just as described.,49159,3
49159,"I was hoping the lacing would be adjustable, but it isn't.",49159,3
49159,"Not a bad belt, works just as it promises.",49159,3
49160,Work out for me nice look,49160,3
49161,It was good quality just the size chart is not accurate so be wary of size differences,49161,3
49162,You will get what you pay for.,49162,3
49163,It is not so warm as I expected.,49163,3
49164,Not quite what I was expecting but still nice for the price,49164,3
49165,Based on the reviews I ordered these tap shoes one size larger than my regular street shoes.,49165,3
49165,"Unfortunately, they were still a half size too short.",49165,3
49165,The width seems true to size.,49165,3
49165,"I'd prefer to order the next size up, but they don't come any larger.",49165,3
49165,"The tap shoes are good quality leather, so I'm going to keep them and use shoe stretchers.",49165,3
49166,I was hoping for something a little more supportive.,49166,3
49167,These capris are a little snug despite buying the plus size.,49167,3
49167,I am a size 12/14.,49167,3
49167,I do however like the thickness of them and material.,49167,3
49168,This product looks exactly like the picture.,49168,3
49168,The dress is a little too see through for me though.,49168,3
49169,Would not purchase again 'sorry',49169,3
49170,ita a little bigger than i thought it is but for price :) its good,49170,3
49172,Umm..this was a total fail on me.,49172,3
49172,But its not really the fault of the outfit itself.,49172,3
49172,You just have to have the right body type for it.,49172,3
49172,It helps if you're really hippy with a small waist.,49172,3
49172,I'm pretty curvy and I still looked like spongebob in it.,49172,3
49172,But I saw a lady come into my job in the same outfit this weekend and she looked pretty good in it.,49172,3
49172,The material is NOT summer casual material.,49172,3
49172,You would get hot and sweaty in this in a heartbeat.,49172,3
49172,Its think and not breathable at all.,49172,3
49172,This is going back.,49172,3
49173,These are so beautiful.,49173,3
49173,I tried one but the jewel popped off.,49173,3
49173,They also fit perfectly in my ear.,49173,3
49174,"Overall, the shirt is nice, although the decal on the front is definitely made from a material that is not as durable.",49174,3
49174,"You do not want to use heat on it whether through washing or drying, otherwise the decal will stick to itself or the shirt.",49174,3
49174,If you try to tear it away then pieces of the decal will tear with it.,49174,3
49174,I've been using a cold wash and air dry without heat and it seems fine.,49174,3
49174,I also pull the shirt inside out so the decal is facing inside.,49174,3
49174,"The shirt could be improved, but equally people need to know how to wash it.",49174,3
49174,"Instructions should be provided with the shirt, but they are not.",49174,3
49175,So this feels really well made.,49175,3
49175,My only issue is with the fit.,49175,3
49175,My son wears 24 month size (he is 19 months old) and I wanted to get it a size bigger so he could wear it for a while.,49175,3
49175,"When I got it it looked big, like I wanted it to, however when I put it on him the belly was tight, and the sleeves were long.",49175,3
49175,I was expecting the sleeves to be long but not the belly area to be tight.,49175,3
49175,"My son is not chunky, he is in the 45th percentile for weight and 80th for height, so he is tall and lean.",49175,3
49175,Hopefully this helps you to be able to pick the right size.,49175,3
49176,Very large for my wrist.,49176,3
49176,"Not impressed with appearance of beads, look like wood and plastic.",49176,3
49177,"It's okay, just runs kinda small (I am a rather large 13 y/o, it looks tiny).",49177,3
49177,Would work well on a toddler or someone younger than 10.,49177,3
49178,Nothing like I thought it would be.,49178,3
49179,It's ok not the best,49179,3
49180,Cute teem fit a little snugg,49180,3
49181,I like the style and quality look of the belt and the adjustment options but I find the release hard to use.,49181,3
49181,I have to first release tension on the belt by pulling to tighten then push the release at the same time but it's still difficult to get it to push in all the way and it hurts my finger tip while pushing it in.,49181,3
49182,Padding is really firm.,49182,3
49182,"If you want to wear a breast plate in the water to protect your girls against coral and jelly fish, this is your suit.",49182,3
49182,Otherwise you may feel a bit awkward if don't appreciate soup bowls stuck on top of your chest.,49182,3
49183,a few of the pieces were broken with sharp edges.,49183,3
49184,These are rather odd with cups that slide and don't really seem to serve much of a purpose.,49184,3
49184,"I take them out, and the bra is not very supportive, but if I leave them in, there is plenty of room to slide left and right, and little to keep them in place.",49184,3
49184,High potential for uni-boob here.,49184,3
49184,I'll keep them for work out bra's but not for everyday use.,49184,3
49184,"I think if the actual material of the bra was more supportive, it would have been much nicer.",49184,3
49185,found it to be a little large not enouth pockets inside for the size of the tote bag,49185,3
49186,Nice Item but does NOT fit Pandora bracelets,49186,3
49187,This dress would have been perfect if it wasn't for the fact that it was way too short and with the split being awkwardly near the center which would have shown my private parts.,49187,3
49187,"I ordered the hot pink in a small, I normally wear a small pre-pregnancy and the color is beautiful but overall the material is too thin and too small.",49187,3
49187,I just returned it.,49187,3
49188,Fits bulky and I will use at some point.,49188,3
49189,"For a costume piece, this worked well but it can't be tied as tight as it needs to go for smaller people.",49189,3
49190,I tried sleeping  in them and when I woke  up they were broken.,49190,3
49191,Good quality but too small.,49191,3
49192,Seemed like a decent quality I guess but the section with sequins was not as described.,49192,3
49192,In the photo the neckline looks quite open with a lot of sequins showing.,49192,3
49192,In reality the cowlneck was covering the sequins way more.,49192,3
49192,And the section with the sequins is just a loose fabric panel inside that shirt that slips and slides around.,49192,3
49193,I ordered a size bigger because I read the reviews and thought bigger would be better.,49193,3
49193,It fit me poorly and I'm not sure if a smaller size would have fit better.,49193,3
49193,"I'm slender and petite 5'6"" 110lbs and the cut was not flattering on me.",49193,3
49193,"Also, there is an upclose photo (the fourth photo in the product images), but I didn't understand what I was seeing.",49193,3
49193,"There is a huge gap maybe 1.5-2inches between the feathers being sewn in and the elastic waistband, and I did not like that from a design perspective.",49193,3
49193,I think it would look better if the feathers came out from the edge of elastic.,49193,3
49193,"Maybe with the right top it wouldn't matter, but If a piece can't stand still on it's own I won't keep it in my collection.",49193,3
49194,Well made but is too big,49194,3
49195,"Like the color, but it was really small, I had to return and re-order.",49195,3
49196,"It runs small, wery small, but the stili is nice and flittering, the seller kindly refund the cast.",49196,3
49196,"Recomend, but order 2 times larg size.",49196,3
49197,Asian sizes run small; even 2X  smaller than American L size.,49197,3
49197,Inexpensive material & stitching; almost disposable,49197,3
49198,After my purchased I found out they are overpriced.,49198,3
49198,They feel good but I will not recommended if you need Wide fit.,49198,3
49199,Runs small-ish but not terrible.,49199,3
49199,My daughter loves it anyway.,49199,3
49201,I bought this item to my wife and first used itself tear out making few holes.....,49201,3
49202,I painted over the elephant head ONLY with clear nail polish before wearing it So the color didn't fade BUT it's too short for my piercing.,49202,3
49202,I wish I could take the elephant head off,49202,3
49203,smaller than I expected.,49203,3
49203,but the GF still loves it.,49203,3
49204,My daughter wanted this for a Dia De Los Muertos dress - she ended up looking like she worked at one of the local Mexican Restaurants.,49204,3
49204,A bit pricey for such a basic dress.,49204,3
49205,"I bought this in 2 colors, the grey is thicker fabric which I love!",49205,3
49205,because it's not see through at all but the neon orange one is made with a thinner fabric so I don't think I could ever wear it out.,49205,3
49205,It's a nice color though.,49205,3
49205,I wish both dresses were made with the same fabric!,49205,3
49206,It is not as long like the picture,49206,3
49207,fits the first couple times but likely to shrink.,49207,3
49207,cheap quality but you get what you pay for.,49207,3
49208,Fit as expected but some of the socks are made funny and slip right down the heal...,49208,3
49208,"The ones that were made properly work great though, so I'm giving 3 stars.",49208,3
49210,I would of prefer another color.,49210,3
49211,It is a nice dress.,49211,3
49211,Not lined so have to wear spanx or something underneath to avoid visible panty lines.,49211,3
49212,Need to wear a tank underneath because of the super large neck!,49212,3
49213,They fit but not baggy enough.,49213,3
49213,Gave them to my daughter.,49213,3
49214,Watch band seems well made.,49214,3
49214,Only wore it once.,49214,3
49214,Disappointed it is only 21mm wide versus advertised 22mm thus leaving a gap when installed and exposing the pins.,49214,3
49215,"I purchased these, received today, according to description they are round, they were not.",49215,3
49215,"Disappointed,  not what I thought I was getting, but I am keeping them.",49215,3
49215,Will try someone else for Round glasses.,49215,3
49215,I'm giving a 3 due to incorrect description .,49215,3
49216,The lining is thin and it's bit loose so I had to return it.,49216,3
49217,I do not like the material of the belt strap.,49217,3
49218,Pretty durable but it does look cheap.,49218,3
49219,This skirt is nicely made and it fit me well but the fabric itself was much more stiff and shiny than I was expecting.,49219,3
49219,"I'm 5'8"" and it hits just below my knee and I ordered my size based on the sizing chart provided.",49219,3
49219,"I will be returning it because I don't like that there isn't much movement in the fabric, but that is only a personal preference of mine.",49219,3
49219,"Overall it's a nice skirt, just not what I specifically wanted.",49219,3
49220,Nice hat but had a seam coming apart right out of the package.,49220,3
49221,Just know that a 38 waist took an XXL.,49221,3
49222,The dress was okay.,49222,3
49222,the material was soft.,49222,3
49222,"I ordered an L, as I usually wear a 12 or 14.",49222,3
49222,It was a little snug.,49222,3
49224,runs small and very thin material,49224,3
49225,They were small and not stretchy at all,49225,3
49226,I really love this bracelet and what it stands for.,49226,3
49226,"This would be my 3rd purchase of this bracelet, the the thing is that the band that holds the beads together wears down over about a month and it snaps and is useless.",49226,3
49226,"This has ended up happening to me all 3 times, so I just forgot about buying another.",49226,3
49226,"I recommend it, but just watch our for the elastic band",49226,3
49227,The size was way off,49227,3
49229,Chain itself was waaayyy to small and I have small head but the st Jude itself is good I just put it on a military dog tag chain and shortened it So it looks the same.,49229,3
49229,Good purchase recommend you buy just have a back up chain,49229,3
49230,I thought I would take the time to give some good feed back on this product.,49230,3
49230,Upon its arrival it is beautiful band the texture of the band is great.,49230,3
49230,I loved that all you had to do was brush the band and it looked like brand new again.,49230,3
49230,Its been six months or so and because I ware the watch everyday and some of the work I do requires me to sometimes get wet.,49230,3
49230,This band is designed for a dress watch you will get the best longevity from it.,49230,3
49230,Last night the leather ripped where the clasp is located making my band  unusable.,49230,3
49230,But this is do to how I wore my watch not the durability or quality of the band.,49230,3
49231,Product arrived in a timely manner.,49231,3
49231,Received product as advertised with no blemishes or defects that were obvious.,49231,3
49231,Used for two weeks on a business trip to Japan and as far as I can tell it worked as described.,49231,3
49231,The finish wore quickly on the black version I ordered.,49231,3
49231,"The lid fitment is not so good as the sides are somewhat too long so after closing the lid it shifts to the side slightly, this causes some latching problems opening and closing at the latch.",49231,3
49231,Basically the hinge and latch are having what I would call premature wear; but the product still works.,49231,3
49231,After using it I will be checking out a wallet card combo with RFID protection; this just wasn't quite the right product for me.,49231,3
49231,"UPDATE: Checked to see if it actually blocks RFID scanners by placing my security ID card in the case and trying to access my office and it worked as advertised, I was locked out until I removed the ID.",49231,3
49232,"I like it, its a little big for my head but if I curl my hair big it fits but other than that its good.",49232,3
49233,"These are great and would have received 5 stars, however, the jade plugs stain my ears green which leads me to believe that they are not truly green jade and are actually dyed.",49233,3
49234,Order down in size!,49234,3
49235,Cute and stylish bag.,49235,3
49235,Only downfall is that the zipper is jacked up and doesn't completely zip shut.,49235,3
49235,I probably would never have it zipped even if it did.,49235,3
49236,Too small to be carrying anything around,49236,3
49237,Fast shipping good customer service.,49237,3
49237,Fur is not as Fluffy as others but still a nice boot.,49237,3
49238,Too small in the butt and too loose in the boobs,49238,3
49239,It was absolutely beautiful and I got so many compliments on it.. but the stones fell out.,49239,3
49240,I ordered the black dress and unlike other reviewers the print is beautiful and vibrant and looks pretty much exactly like the picture.,49240,3
49240,It's not see through at all.,49240,3
49240,"The neck line is good along with the arm holes, im 5'3"" 120lbs and ordered a medium.",49240,3
49240,"The ONLY problem I have with the dress is the length, it hits right at the bottom of my butt whic is way too short for any outing.",49240,3
49240,I was super disappointed because it really is pretty.,49240,3
49240,I'm going to see what I can do to let it out at the straps at the top some and maybe try to wear it with a longer slip if it doesn't look ridiculous.,49240,3
49240,I wouldn't order a bigger size though because it might get too wide.,49240,3
49240,"For $5 it's not a total loss, I'm going to try to save it!",49240,3
49240,"Don't buy if you are super tall though, it will be a shirt on you.",49240,3
49241,They arrived made of a copper/brass color I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for surgical steel.,49241,3
49241,With that said after ge silver color feels off completely to reveal the copper core they look fairly good.,49241,3
49241,Have had mibe for a couple of years now.,49241,3
49241,They get better with age as the exposed copper patinas,49241,3
49242,Keeps falling off my lady's wrist,49242,3
49243,"Nice pants, too small",49243,3
49244,A little tight in the calves but so cute that I kept them anyway.,49244,3
49246,The fabric is a bit shiny for my taste.,49246,3
49246,Plus I have a large booty so I would only wear this with a long top as I'm not into revealing any booty crack!,49246,3
49247,"Really cute pattern and comfortable fit, but see through.",49247,3
49248,Not the material I was hoping for.,49248,3
49248,"Was hoping for more of the ""Stance"" brand sock material.",49248,3
49248,These wore out quickly.,49248,3
49249,The shoes are too large in the toe box and around the heel and I think this is because they are men's shoes.,49249,3
49249,"I thought I would be able to wear them because I have always bought Converse sneakers in men's sizes, but because these shoes are more constructed and not soft like Converse, they are just too large for my foot.",49249,3
49250,it kind of looked like a child glued it together,49250,3
49251,Purchased as a gift.,49251,3
49251,They were bigger than I expected but the recipient liked them.,49251,3
49252,"I thought it would be a sweater, it was woven jersey fabric, too casual for the office.",49252,3
49253,"Baggy, they say get one size bigger but I should have gotten my size",49253,3
49255,"too short for a dress, more like a long tee shirt",49255,3
49256,I ordered her size and it will still work for what we are doing but they do run a little small.,49256,3
49257,Based on the other reviewers I ordered a large when I normally wear medium since they said it runs small.,49257,3
49257,"I am 6' 2"" and 190 lbs.",49257,3
49257,"This shirt seems like a large to me, so I guess it fits as expected.",49257,3
49257,Maybe the company fixed the issue?,49257,3
49257,"In any case, the cotton shirt is fine but it is nothing more than a $3 variety.",49257,3
49257,The cotton isn't soft and thus it doesn't feel great to wear.,49257,3
49257,I find the print to be very nice and as expected.,49257,3
49257,I think it is overpriced for what it is.,49257,3
49257,I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this in a store.,49257,3
49257,I bought it for the cool print but I think the company could have spent more on quality cotton shirts.,49257,3
49258,It was way to long but fit up top,49258,3
49259,material is really nice and they aren't super thick but my son just turned 6months and these barely fit him and he is low in his percentile(2months premature) so for an average 6month baby these may be to small.,49259,3
49260,Hard to click and unclick,49260,3
49261,"Good price and fits newborn babies well, but fabric does not hold up very well",49261,3
49262,"At first it was tight trying to get it on, but it fits fine.",49262,3
49263,Honestly not worth $25 but whatever I love the color and print.,49263,3
49264,I like the watch until water got in it and it stopped working.,49264,3
49264,I brought it because it was waterproof,49264,3
49265,It is very long waisted.,49265,3
49265,Will have to return it.,49265,3
49266,OK - all of a sudden I am out of words,49266,3
49268,I purchased this basically for the top and with that I am not disappointed - it is about what I expected.,49268,3
49268,This is not an expensive suit that will last years but for the money it seems ok - I did read reviews first and ordered larger thank I normally would - I am about a 20 and got the 6x that felt horrible but glad I did - my biggest complaint is the shorts - they are white lined in the front and they roll up every time you move - will be wearing different bottoms with it but I had purchased mostly for the top anyway - had the bottoms worked it would have been an extra win for me.,49268,3
49269,This was just okay.,49269,3
49269,I probably wouldn't order it again.,49269,3
49270,"Lace area 'see through', online photo of product does not accurately show this.",49270,3
49271,I love the colors and style of these panties.,49271,3
49271,They are so cute but had to give 3 stars due to the quality.,49271,3
49271,The panties were actually a little big on me when I first wore them bit now after a few months they have shrunk quite a bit after several washes.,49271,3
49271,I'm sad I won't be able to wear them longer though because they're really cute,49271,3
49272,"I like the color , the sleeves are kind of big.they are not fit like the look in the picture.",49272,3
49273,I wear a M/L usually and ordered a XXL and it was tight tight tight... Not the cute kind of tight...,49273,3
49273,The kind were you're worried you're going to blow the shirt right off!!,49273,3
49273,"The lace (which is the cutest part) doesn't have any give, so order accordingly.",49273,3
49274,I bought these for my daughter who is 12.,49274,3
49274,They don't have the best arch support so if you have naturally high arches like I do you may want to invest in some good arch supports.,49274,3
49274,Also if you have narrow feet these may be a bit wide as canvas shoes are.,49274,3
49274,"These are a little pricey, I've seen less expensive, but they are cute shoes so we'll see how well they wash and wear.",49274,3
49275,"these are china sizes and not sure what size i even got, i will have to wait for Christmas to see how big but i know they won't fit.",49275,3
49276,Silver Turned color fast :/,49276,3
49277,"Otherwise, it does fit as expected",49277,3
49278,The bra area  itches a lot,49278,3
49279,"Beautiful shoes, but awful smells",49279,3
49280,It was too fitted at bottom.,49280,3
49280,I was looking for more of a flare as pictured.,49280,3
49280,I typically wear size small but these run small.,49280,3
49281,"I normally take size lg,I thought due to the price go up a size xlg still item runs very small",49281,3
49282,"The hat was very stylish and very well made, but too small for my head.",49282,3
49282,The shape of my head makes it difficult for me to find hats that fit.,49282,3
49282,I returned it but would be willing to reorder if it comes in a larger size.,49282,3
49283,Very cute style and print but disappointed in the sizing.,49283,3
49284,My son and I have a mother and son dance I ordered this shirt to match my dress.,49284,3
49284,I got it in and it's a completely different color than the one that ordered.,49284,3
49284,It's too late to exchange it but it is a beautiful shirt and tie.,49284,3
49284,Just wish it was the right color.,49284,3
49285,"According to reviews and measurements I ordered a XL and it is a tad big ( I am 36DD waist 35 hips 42), a large would have been better, but sleeves snug as it should , but I had to wait so long I don't really  want to return it or it would be the end of spring by the time it arrives again' .",49285,3
49285,I can make it work best by skinny belting it untucked over a pencil midi or maxi  skirt I think.,49285,3
49285,On second thought I will exchange it for a L or even M.,49285,3
49287,Product fits just right not to small not to big.,49287,3
49287,The belt is a little cheap but can be replaced.,49287,3
49288,"These were true to size, however he color of these shoes are much more of a yellow gold.",49288,3
49288,"When compared to other gold shoes that were similar style, these stuck out, a lot.",49288,3
49288,"So if you want loud and in your face gold glittery shoes, then these are for you.",49288,3
49288,Too much for me.,49288,3
49288,Ended up returning them.,49288,3
49290,Fits well but came bent and it never completely unbent after a few months.,49290,3
49291,I weigh 160lbs and am a 36C .,49291,3
49291,"Most of my weight is in my bottom so I knew it would be a bit short, if I had gone with the large it may have fit better in that aspect .",49291,3
49291,The color was way darker than what was pictured on several different computer and phone screens .,49291,3
49291,I spent weeks looking at this dress before buying it (and the color isn't ugly per say but it's definitely not as pictured) we'll just say it was color issue on all those screens anyway for technologies and a somewhat positive reviews sake .,49291,3
49291,I gave this dress three stars mostly because of the sleeves and the collar .,49291,3
49291,"The collar constantly sticks up even though I've ironed it practically to death (this is after I washed it; WARNING: HAND WASH AND TUMBLE OR HANG TO DRY) and the sleeves are huge, too long and uneven .",49291,3
49291,Luckily these are all fixable issues by way of sewing but it shouldn't have to be that way .,49291,3
49291,All in all it's a pretty dress but has a few flaws .,49291,3
49292,"Style is excellent , good lens protection",49292,3
49293,"The addition of ""shawl"" in description of this item is very misleading.",49293,3
49293,It probably wouldn't fit a toddler as a shawl.,49293,3
49293,The scarf is very much a head/neck scarf.,49293,3
49293,"Had the item arrived on time for prom, I would've been more disappointed.",49293,3
49293,"As it is, we'll just add it to our spring wardrobe.",49293,3
49293,It's a very cute little scarf.,49293,3
49293,The item was quickly shipped and packaged well.,49293,3
49294,It runs small it didn't fit but it was beautiful,49294,3
49295,Gave this charm to my daughter for her Pandora bracelet.,49295,3
49295,The charm didn't look as nice as the picture.,49295,3
49295,The child's face looks distorted and .... well.... ugly.,49295,3
49295,"It did fit the bracelet, and my daughter seems to like it.",49295,3
49295,"But please take into consideration that the charm is smaller than the picture, so it won't look as clear.",49295,3
49296,Material is not that great but not bad for the price!,49296,3
49297,To small but looked nice,49297,3
49298,Returned and got a bigger size and it's still a little snug across the bust but still very cute for the preppy layered look.,49298,3
49299,"I haven't gotten it to glow, and the chain is very cheap looking.",49299,3
49299,Looks like it's fit for a 12 year old.,49299,3
49300,"I am 5'3"", 148 lbs, chest 38 DD, waist 30"", and hips 39.5"".",49300,3
49300,I purchased using the size chart.,49300,3
49300,The material is medium weight has some stretch in it.,49300,3
49300,The stitching is good.,49300,3
49300,I washed it and it held up well.,49300,3
49300,The buttons are plasticky and it's obvious so I will be replacing those.,49300,3
49300,"From the frontal view, you can see how my bust displaces the middle buttons.",49300,3
49300,I will adjust that with the replacing of the buttons.,49300,3
49300,It is a very comfortable dress and works well for the office.,49300,3
49301,The only problem I have with this shirt is the picture depicts the shirt as flowy this is a very stiff that shirt it is not going to flow it's more like the look of a trench coat then a flowy shirt that's the only problem I have with it other than that it's super cute,49301,3
49302,"The top is too large, and the bottom is tight!",49302,3
49302,"My measurements are 32B bust, 26.5"" waist, and 38"" hips.",49302,3
49302,I'm trying to find someone who has bigger bust and smaller butt/hips than me.,49302,3
49303,Nice product but very small cut...we ordered an adult medium and it is more like a small or x-small.,49303,3
49304,"I needed a fabric for my pants that is soft, as I have sensitive skin.",49304,3
49304,I return these pants because they were too large and fabric was not soft enough for my needs.,49304,3
49305,Not bad.. Front pockets aren't very deep and thighs are a little too tight.,49305,3
49306,Very pretty but it was too long for me.,49306,3
49307,"The ""one size fits all"" is a bit big on me - I'm 5'2"", 110lbs, and usually wear an XS or S. I would say that this ""one size fits all"" would be a better size for someone who wears a M or L. But it's not so big that it does not fit and would still function as a beach cover up.",49307,3
49307,The scrunched part in the front under the bust isn't tight on me but at least gives it a little more shape.,49307,3
49307,It's a little long but not past my knees.,49307,3
49307,I am not sure if I'm going to keep it or return it yet.,49307,3
49308,"I purchased this blouse thinking it would be unique, something different since it was Asymmetric.",49308,3
49308,"Instead, I feel like it was odd looking.",49308,3
49308,It just fit strangely and did not lay right.,49308,3
49308,"I ordered a size L. I am 54, 145 lbs, 38 C bust.",49308,3
49308,"It was not small, just not the blouse for me.",49308,3
49308,"Possibly, it was just not the right blouse for me because the style is more for a younger person (maybe someone under 30).",49308,3
49308,The price is definitely reasonable and the blue color is very pretty.,49308,3
49309,They a small for both of us.,49309,3
49309,But they are cute,49309,3
49310,Newborn size is a bit small compared to other newborn clothing.,49310,3
49310,It's a little awkward to put on.,49310,3
49312,"Image indicates 1 pink, 1 red, 1grey, 1 blue, 1 black, 1 brown.",49312,3
49312,"I received 2 pink, 1 red, 2 grey, 1 brown.",49312,3
49312,"Ordered the ""3-4 years"" size.",49312,3
49312,They were too small for my 5 year old and slightly big on my 2 year old.,49312,3
49312,Quality is good and they seem very warm.,49312,3
49313,This waist trainer only works for a good two to three weeks it will rise up in the back especially if you have a large butt or if your hips are wide.,49313,3
49313,I recommend people with a large butt or wide hips not to but it.,49313,3
49313,"And as far as the fit, it was a size too big.",49313,3
49314,get 2 sizes up than what u normally wear,49314,3
49315,Cute- but looked better on the model in the picture,49315,3
49316,"The cut is kind of boxy, your hourglass won't show thru unless you make alterations",49316,3
49317,I must modify this beret before I will be able to wear it.,49317,3
49317,Other than size it has a liner and the trim is not comfortable and not well attached.,49317,3
49317,"Sorry, but, I've worn berets all my life and this is maybe cover for the head with hair not for someone with none.",49317,3
49318,I love the color of this scarf.,49318,3
49319,Very cute nose rings.,49319,3
49319,"They're a little short and don't quite go all the way around to circle my nose, so you can see the tip of the other end.",49319,3
49319,But works for the most part.,49319,3
49320,Not for big chests.,49320,3
49321,It's a shirt... doesn't come close to be a dress not even a mini dress.,49321,3
49321,It's up to my hips,49321,3
49323,"It's nice and well done but too small, although I've ordered the XL.",49323,3
49323,"I'm 5'6, 170 lb, and it's way too revealing for me.",49323,3
49323,"Not to mention the part of the bikini covering the butt comes up only half way, leaving buttocks exposed.",49323,3
49323,So unless you are supper skinny like the model in the pic... good luck!,49323,3
49324,"While these tie clips are a good unobtrusive size, they are crimped overly tight and are mirror polished, unlike the matte finish shown in the picture.",49324,3
49324,"Rather than bending the clips back acutely,  I found that placing them on a mug and leaving them helped to relieve the spring tension somewhat.",49324,3
49324,I think hitting them with a scotch brite pad or ceramic bead blaster will give a more subtle finish.,49324,3
49324,"Nevertheless, if you are looking for a shiny, high polished clip, these are a good value.",49324,3
49325,The vest is very nice looking but was definitely not a USA medium.,49325,3
49326,This dress is way too small.,49326,3
49326,I ordered this for my cousin and the large looks like a small; It cant even fit her as a blouse.,49326,3
49326,The dress looks ok but you have to go about 3 sizes up.,49326,3
49327,"Need to glue, the side that holds the elastic fell off...",49327,3
49328,Looks ok but very thin and synthetic,49328,3
49329,"I got a small, it was really pretty and the color was alright (think bubble gum) but the problem was it was too large and long on me.",49329,3
49329,"I am 5'3"" and around 110lbs.",49329,3
49329,It is definitely on the conservative side.,49329,3
49330,"I received the shirt yesterday and immediately wanted to try it on, as it did fit as it was supposed to, I was surprised that it was printed on a fruit of the loom shirt.",49330,3
49330,Although I bought this when it was on sale for 4.99 I honestly can't say I would be keeping it if I paid any higher for it.,49330,3
49330,"Overall, it does seem to be an ok shirt",49330,3
49331,"Very short and the quality isn't the best, though its a beautiful dress",49331,3
49332,Cheap price- Cheap material,49332,3
49333,all of the items are very small.,49333,3
49333,this seems like it is made for travel.,49333,3
49333,I was looking for something for frequent home use and this is not it.,49333,3
49335,"I loved these pants, so much so that I ordered another pair and was let down.",49335,3
49335,The second pair were cheaply made with a completely different quality,49335,3
49336,"Just a little more ""chunkier"" in size then I expected.",49336,3
49339,"I ordered one size up because the other reviews said the fit was too small now i know it would have been fine if i would have got my size ,its not fitted like i wanted but I Will keep it don't want to bother with a return.",49339,3
49339,I gave it three stars for the quality the price should be a little less also the hood is too small for adult I think it's child size....next time I will go to a store and try it on (Oops ),49339,3
49340,quality okay but too small in the top area.,49340,3
49340,(I'm what they call top-heavy.,49340,3
49340,4-6 in the bottom but 38DD up top.),49340,3
49340,Had to ship it back.,49340,3
49340,When will designers make swimwear in a one piece with options of smaller top or bottom.,49340,3
49340,I know this means custom but if it can be done and reasonably priced the person would make a FORTUNE!,49340,3
49341,This top is soft and comfortable but it is literally a piece of material with two strips of elastic.,49341,3
49341,Don't expect it to stay up if you move too far in any particular direction.,49341,3
49341,"I'm not overly endowed, but if you are, you don't want this top; it will roll to your belly button.",49341,3
49341,Best use is to sleep in on a hot night....camping.,49341,3
49342,Can't find a canvas belt with real leather,49342,3
49343,I had mine tailored before it was shipped.,49343,3
49343,I love the gown but I was disappointed that the embellishments were not as in the pictures.,49343,3
49343,I was able to communicate with the seller and she will be sending me additional embellishments.,49343,3
49343,This gown is going to be my wedding gown.,49343,3
49343,It is stunning and I've had many compliment on it.,49343,3
49343,I would have given it a 5 star if it didn't lack on the embellishments.,49343,3
49343,I do give 5 star for the seller DressyStar.,49343,3
49344,"I got the XL (5'6'', 165 lb) and it fits fine.",49344,3
49344,"However, I have really thin arms and the sleeves are too narrow to wear as shown in picture.",49344,3
49344,"Since that is how I like to wear my shirts, it loses favor with me.",49344,3
49344,"Also, if you like the feel and wash of cotton this top feels too polyestery and pills after washing.",49344,3
49345,"Nice shirt - ordered the right size, yet it was too small",49345,3
49346,"Very beautiful at first glance, but not very sturdy",49346,3
49347,A little sad because it's about 1 size smaller than it says it is,49347,3
49348,It's a cute accessorie.,49348,3
49348,It's light not heavy at all.,49348,3
49348,I would rate 5 stars but the problem is that the chain constantly pulls on my hair and on the thread from my shirts.,49348,3
49348,In the picture you can see the amount of thread it pulled out.,49348,3
49348,Otherwise it's a good buy,49348,3
49349,"looks great, fits perfectly.",49349,3
49349,"word to the wise, if you're a bit chesty like me (38DDD) its not exactly functional.",49349,3
49349,lots of nip slips because the top part rolls up and off the boob.,49349,3
49349,"but it still looks great if you're just wearing it to hang out with friends, not too much movement or activity.",49349,3
49350,"I'm 5'3, 120lbs, 32C, I purchased a small and the top fit perfectly.",49350,3
49350,I wear a size 0 or 25 for pants/jeans.,49350,3
49350,The bottoms were too tight and made me look chubby.,49350,3
49350,Since the the bathign suit was so cheap I decided to keep it and just purchase a different pair of bottoms.,49350,3
49350,I was afraid if I went up a size the top would be too big for me.,49350,3
49350,It seems as though the bathing suit was made for someone with little to no butt and a little more on top.,49350,3
49351,This type of blouse should fit with room but this one was not true to size - much too large,49351,3
49352,Very cute dress and we'll made.,49352,3
49352,It fits a little small through the underarm and chest and I'm of average size.,49352,3
49353,Tends to make you look wider.,49353,3
49353,I am only a 7.,49353,3
49354,Its what I expected for the price... Not sure how long itll hold up but it is soft and functional enough,49354,3
49355,"I can see why they call it corduroy, but it's crazy thin.",49355,3
49355,it's pricey for the weight of the favric.,49355,3
49355,for it was fine and true to size.,49355,3
49356,Nice shirt but the 2x fit like a large and it had very tight sleeves.,49356,3
49356,I gave it to my son.,49356,3
49357,Very cute top but a little too small.,49357,3
49357,Can't really wear this on vacation like I wanted to because with any movement my boobs pop out the sides.,49357,3
49357,Guess it's gonna have to look cute with a cardigan on over,49357,3
49358,"Poor fabric, looks shipper",49358,3
49359,A little revealing up top but I wear a cardigan with it and pull it up so it works.,49359,3
49359,I admittedly have larger breasts (36DD before pregnancy).,49359,3
49360,"Ordered an XL, fit more like a L so order a size bigger for sure, I would also not dry it, shrunk a bit in the dryer.",49360,3
49360,"Good price though, just wish it was a tad bigger.",49360,3
49360,"Came quickly, way faster than expected.",49360,3
49361,The picture makes it look slim fit.,49361,3
49361,The shoulders and arms fit right then the trunk is kind of big.,49361,3
49362,"I like the look of the dress but it was way to small, I could not use it.",49362,3
49362,I ended up giving it to someone else,49362,3
49363,was a little small but so pretty.,49363,3
49364,Unfortunately top is a bit see through and daughter complains that the shorts are too itchy.,49364,3
49364,I don't know if she's just being dramatic or if they really are but she refuses to wear it.,49364,3
49364,It looked cute when she tried it on but she hasn't worn it since!,49364,3
49365,Little cheap looking but ok for money.,49365,3
49366,A lot of folk ask where I got them as always AMAZON.COM,49366,3
49367,I like my hoodies big but this sweatshirt is huge.,49367,3
49367,"For some reason, I thought it was a junior's size, so I ordered an XL to ensure it wouldn't be too small.",49367,3
49367,It is not junior's sized.,49367,3
49367,I also do not think it would ever fit anyone like it does the model in the picture.,49367,3
49367,"Mine fits as if it was made for a very, very round person - or was worn by one for months before being given to me.",49367,3
49367,I am not a round person and this is also the largest XL I have ever seen.,49367,3
49367,"I've tried to shrink it because I didn't want to hassle with returning/exchanging but all that did was make it shorter and, after two washes, it's already getting worn-out looking, with little fabric fuzzies.",49367,3
49367,"So, that tells me the fabric isn't high quality or durable.",49367,3
49367,"On the upside, it is softer (even if it is also thinner) than most hoodies and very pretty but, overall, I'm really disappointed, especially since it wasn't cheap.",49367,3
49368,"Bra arrived on time, even with an expedited delivery date, and seemed to be as described - EXCEPT for the size.",49368,3
49368,"I am a 36D, no matter where I shop or what style of bra I wear...this stated that it would fit someone my size.",49368,3
49368,"However, when it arrived, the cups looked like they wouldn't fit above a B cup-size.",49368,3
49368,They barely provided enough coverage for my nipples - and I'm not that chesty!,49368,3
49368,Just a tall woman with a large frame.,49368,3
49368,"I contacted the company, was refunded in full, and now have a bra that no one can use...so my rating is based on the customer service and care I received, as opposed to the product itself.",49368,3
49369,"This runs a little ""short"" in the gathered/smocked on top.",49369,3
49369,"A few more inches of smocking before the skirt part started (top to bottom, not side to side) would help this lay better on women with a bust.",49369,3
49369,If you are bigger than an A or small B you might want to go for a different style dress,49369,3
49370,I ordered a size up so it would sit a little lower on my hips but it was still a high high top skirt.,49370,3
49370,good quality but not the fit I hoped for.,49370,3
49371,It's very pretty but too small in the bust area.,49371,3
49372,"Cute, but I thought it would be longer",49372,3
49373,"Omg this tank top doesn't look like in the picture, it looks cheaper and looks like it's in a wrong way (inside is outside).it fits a little tight so I would recommend a size larger than you usually wear.",49373,3
49373,But the material it's soft and the collor it's cute.,49373,3
49374,I am sorry I bought this bag.,49374,3
49374,"It doesn't have a leather smell, but that of the vegetable oil it seems to have been soaked in.",49374,3
49374,The long strap doesn't fit into the strip of leather outside the buckle.,49374,3
49374,"As I tried to insert the strap, oil seeped out of the leather onto my hands.",49374,3
49374,I can't touch the bag without that awful smell getting on me.,49374,3
49374,I don't know if I will ever be able to use this.,49374,3
49375,"Once I put the stockings on theythey don't stay up, they roll down my legs and I have to constantly keep pulling them back up, just to have them roll back down again!",49375,3
49376,This shirt run big for 18-20 I should got a medium to small,49376,3
49377,"I wear a US XL, this shirt runs very very small paid a seemstress $30.00 to have changes made so it would fit",49377,3
49378,"received a blemished product (one tiny link is discolored, mangled) but considering the price, not worth the time and effort to return

i wish this bracelet was offered in a curved end-link style, but considering this will be used on a cheap beater Timex Submariner homage, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timex-Men-s-T2M563-Dress-Sports-Black-Dial-Black-Leather-Strap-Watch/dp/B000T7QC6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timex Men's T2M563 Dress Sports Black Dial Black Leather Strap Watch</a>, i don't care...

the adjustment is not intuitive, but you can easily  do it once you figure it out (pry up via the slot on the underside, then slide the bottom clasp to where you want it...

band is easy to clasp or remove",49378,3
49379,"I ordered by the chart, and it's not true to size.",49379,3
49380,Looks very stylish and fits well but made poorly.,49380,3
49380,There were some threads hanging down but really no one can notice unless they get real close.,49380,3
49380,It does look pretty on regardless of the flaws.,49380,3
49381,I usually wear medium.,49381,3
49381,Just to be on the safe side I ordered a large.,49381,3
49381,It did not fit.,49381,3
49382,This shirt runs small around the arms.,49382,3
49382,The material feels silky.,49382,3
49382,Overall it looks like the picture.,49382,3
49383,For very slim ALL over girls.,49383,3
49384,I am 38D and x-large feels fitted.,49384,3
49384,"The front view is great, but the back material is cheap, so you must wear a sweater or jacket to hide back.",49384,3
49384,Also the back side easily goes up on its own showing your waist.,49384,3
49385,"Item run small, overall i liked the product.",49385,3
49385,I bought this for a friend who is a size small i ordered a large and it was a perfect fit.,49385,3
49385,Def cant wash it or it won't fit any more :(,49385,3
49386,Its a nice dress.,49386,3
49386,"Very short and revealing, in the picture its longer.",49386,3
49386,I bought the suggested size online a L and it fit but it was shorter.,49386,3
49386,not a bad dress though.,49386,3
49387,"for the price it was about right, but it did not fit me very well at all.",49387,3
49388,"unfortunately the ""leather"" has already worn off in several places.",49388,3
49388,glad this is just a fun watch and not one for dress ware,49388,3
49389,I would give it 3.5 starts.,49389,3
49389,"I'm 5'7"" and 135 lbs, 36B bra size, and I ordered a Small.",49389,3
49389,The fabric is pretty good but wish it could be better.,49389,3
49389,Or wish the material could be a bit thicker.,49389,3
49389,Okay for the price overall.,49389,3
49390,they are comfortable and fit as expected,49390,3
49391,But not size I wanted.,49391,3
49392,its perfect for a watch to workout and outdoor sports and It is very light :),49392,3
49393,It's way too big I need a small instead of a medium,49393,3
49394,the size of those swim suits does not math US size.,49394,3
49394,"It's one size smaller, so if you need to buy one you need to order one size bigger than what it is.",49394,3
49395,I ended up returning this jacket as it was too big for me.,49395,3
49395,It is very light and I think it would be easy to travel with.,49395,3
49395,"But I'm usually a small/medium for t-shirts, running more medium than small, so I thought a medium would be good for me as I was planning on wearing layers (I'm 5'7"" and 130 lbs).",49395,3
49395,It felt like a bag over me.,49395,3
49395,The cut wasn't flattering.,49395,3
49395,"Also, the material is really noisy.",49395,3
49395,I can imagine it being annoying in the quiet wilderness.,49395,3
49396,"A lot flimsier than it looks, but is still simple and cute",49396,3
49397,Is what it is.,49397,3
49397,Inexpensive and looks it.,49397,3
49397,Great for kids/ teen,49397,3
49398,it comes undone a lot and will probably be easily lost in time,49398,3
49400,Pretty dress but way too big!,49400,3
49400,"I'm 5'2 & 130 pounds, got a size small & it was HUGE.",49400,3
49402,Liked the shape but too small.,49402,3
49402,I take 40 d and I was hanging out all over.,49402,3
49404,I am big chested woman 4'11 tall.,49404,3
49404,the top for me is too loose and the skirt too tight.it rides up,49404,3
49405,Arrived with a broken chain!,49405,3
49406,The product was a little snug,49406,3
49407,"Super cute, but could fefibe a bit larger.",49407,3
49407,Hard to fit a permit inside as it was intended for.,49407,3
49408,It is ok for that price and if you just want to wear it at the beach.,49408,3
49409,Shirt was weird shaped.,49409,3
49410,These stockings are sexy and beautiful but they run big and long.,49410,3
49410,They go all the way up to the top of my thighs.,49410,3
49410,"Although I'm 5'4"", I have really long legs.",49410,3
49410,I wish they came in a smaller size.,49410,3
49411,Was so disappointed in this bag!,49411,3
49411,"Based on the measurements given online it was the same as the work bag I currently have, which is large.",49411,3
49411,This is nothing like a work bag.,49411,3
49411,It's a big purse.,49411,3
49411,I would only be able to fit a laptop and some folders.,49411,3
49411,"I need something wider to hold more items,,,stacks of paper, binders, etc.",49411,3
49411,Will be returning it.,49411,3
49411,It's good quality though.,49411,3
49411,The three stars is because the measurements are deceiving.,49411,3
49413,Cute dress but BEWARE of the material.,49413,3
49413,It's not cotton feeling at all.,49413,3
49413,It's more of an elastic lingerie material.,49413,3
49413,Loved the dress but the material was a no good.,49413,3
49414,large jacket fits like an XL shorts fit like a medium and belt like a small!!,49414,3
49414,wondering if they just threw my costume together at the last min.,49414,3
49414,so now i have to fix it myself because it is too close to Halloween.,49414,3
49416,"Like the shirts, but I ordered my usual size and they are large on me.",49416,3
49416,I would suggest ordering a size smaller than you normally wear.,49416,3
49417,"I am petite and skinny, 5 feet tall .... these were a little loose on me.",49417,3
49417,"Nothing crazy, but a little loose.",49417,3
49418,It was a beautiful bathing suit but o not ordered one and I got two and charged for two.,49418,3
49418,Also it was to small.,49418,3
49419,"It looked well, wasn't a fan of the waist band, I thought it was broader.",49419,3
49420,"The only thing i found wrong was color, it said soft pink, i got bright pink.",49420,3
49421,Top is pretty but the bottom and much of the dress is low quality and the material is frayed,49421,3
49422,Cute but not really a good material,49422,3
49423,It's very pretty BUT I was hoping that they would ask for personalized writing where it says place text here?!,49423,3
49423,"So you have this gorgeous tree and bird and then ""place your text here""?!",49423,3
49423,As well as the case is NOT good for protection AT ALL!!,49423,3
49424,Something is in the final product is lacking.,49424,3
49424,"The straps won't stay in place, the buckle doesn't close properly.",49424,3
49424,For this price I expected a much better quality.,49424,3
49425,"Wanted to love this dress, but the arm area is very tight.",49425,3
49426,Cute but they look cheap.,49426,3
49426,I guess I wasn't aware that they were made from cheap looking polyester.,49426,3
49427,The chemical smell was awful.,49427,3
49427,I aired it out for weeks.,49427,3
49427,I gave 3 stars because the 12 yr old birthday girl who I bought it for loved it,49427,3
49428,"First off, I'm writing on my husband's Amazon account.",49428,3
49428,My husband purchased these for me and I do absolutely love them- however- why didn't the maker put like a clear plastic coating on these things to soften the edges?,49428,3
49428,They are *sharp* and I did actually slice my finger on one of the x-wings when I was trying to untangle it from my hair.,49428,3
49428,"They were a bit too long and snagged on my coat, my hair, my clothing and so my daughter shortened the length for me.",49428,3
49428,"Other than the above issues, they are definitely bad-ass and I wear them on occasion.",49428,3
49429,Cute and we'll made but WAY too small.,49429,3
49430,"I wound up ordering three jackets because the XL, which should have fit was tight, then the second jacket I ordered a 2XL and was sent a Large and finally the third order came as ordered in a 2XL, which should be too big for me is also snug!",49430,3
49430,Luckily I have three daughter's who love Grease and will use them.,49430,3
49430,If I didn't need this jacket for a work party - I wouldn't have bothered after the first jacket was too small.,49430,3
49431,I would order a size larger than you normally do.,49431,3
49431,"I expected this to be flowy, and ordered it in my normal pregnancy size - Lg.",49431,3
49431,"It is also pretty see through, so make sure you are prepared to wear some sort of slip or nude undergarment.",49431,3
49431,I plan on returning this dress.,49431,3
49432,A little bigger is better to order a smaller size,49432,3
49433,"Cute, but the XL wouldn't even pull over my B chest.",49433,3
49433,I usually wear a L (10-12).,49433,3
49434,It stated one size fits all but these are made for children.,49434,3
49434,An adult can not wear this,49434,3
49435,A cute outfit but fits extremely small.,49435,3
49435,I ordered a large and I am a size 10 and it was more like a size 4 or 6,49435,3
49437,The outfit was ok for the price.,49437,3
49437,I bought a medium but it fit a little loose.,49437,3
49437,The strap on the top isn't attached kept falling off.,49437,3
49437,The top was def smaller to size i bought a bra similar to the top to wear underneath because my boobs were very expose .,49437,3
49438,stoped working after 60days.,49438,3
49440,"The jersey was exactly what I wanted, unfortunately  it was to small for me as a male...so I gave it to my girlfriend to wear.",49440,3
49442,Ordered this in a size large (I am normally a 8-10/ 10-12 in women's.),49442,3
49442,The sizing must be for teens as the fit was totally off.,49442,3
49442,The sleeves were impossibly tight - no way you could scrunch them up as the photo shows.,49442,3
49442,I could return and order the next size up but the top itself does not really have any shaping to it.,49442,3
49442,If I were to order a larger size (extra large) it would look like a tent on me.,49442,3
49442,"The plaid was a good color red, but the plaid portion of the top does not stretch at all (sleeves and backing) so it is not forgiving when pulling it over your head.",49442,3
49442,Over all not as cute as it looks in the photo or as comfortable.,49442,3
49442,Perhaps if you are a size small and a teen this will work for you.,49442,3
49443,I like the shirt but even for large it was not as loose as it shows in picture.,49443,3
49444,You don't get to pick which ones you get but they are all cute.,49444,3
49444,My only problem is i need them to fit tight so you don't see the chain but it's really hard it put them on.,49444,3
49444,I can never put it on by myself.,49444,3
49445,"The shirt is cute,  but the cut is strange....",49445,3
49445,It bubbles out at the waist instead of tapering in.,49445,3
49446,i don't like the material,49446,3
49447,"Does not go over my knee, but works with my air cast.",49447,3
49448,"Bought for my son, but they seemed so gigantic on his feet, and he has big feet.",49448,3
49448,They were too big on him.,49448,3
49448,So unfortunately I am returning them; but they look like a great pair of sandals.,49448,3
49449,The problem is that its really too short,49449,3
49451,This looks like a Pajama Top.,49451,3
49451,I feel like it adds 50 lbs.,49451,3
49451,"I would have returned it, but not a free return.",49451,3
49452,Its a little thicker than I had hoped it to be.,49452,3
49452,Makes clasping the post of my dermal a little difficult.,49452,3
49453,I wanted the V-neck- did not get so returned.,49453,3
49454,Loose fit but they'll work under a shirt.,49454,3
49454,Extra long on this short person.,49454,3
49454,"Color is good, don't fade  in warm wash and don't shrink.",49454,3
49455,This is extremely small.,49455,3
49455,"Pretty, but I thought it would be bigger from the description.",49455,3
49456,Cute but a lot more see through than expected,49456,3
49457,"Nice silky cotton, I didn't wear it on a beach but I could see how it would be absorbent and helpful in that setting.",49457,3
49457,"However, I would like to point out that which you cannot tell from pictures, this is basically two rectangles sewn together with openings for your arms.",49457,3
49457,There are no real sleeves to speak of.,49457,3
49457,"That being the case, it tends to slide down my shoulders and doesn't do a great job of covering my backside.",49457,3
49458,The lower layer skirt is made from a tough stiff material and so it does not stay as it shows in the picture.,49458,3
49458,Also around the chest area is not as well tailored as picture.,49458,3
49459,Really pretty but starts turning colors quickly if you wear it too often.,49459,3
49460,It's super cute but that's all I can say about it right now bc it's way too small.,49460,3
49461,"Quality wasn't the greatest, a bit small, but still not a BAD purchase.",49461,3
49462,I really like this product this skirt  Beautiful  I recommend this skirt also  I receive the skirts  Very fast '',49462,3
49464,The blouse is really cute but unless you are a petite person do not bother to purchase.,49464,3
49464,This is definitely not meant for an average size person.,49464,3
49464,"The company did fine, the clothing runs small.",49464,3
49465,the pads don't stay in place.,49465,3
49465,the straps are a little long.,49465,3
49466,"I received Maleficent horns instead of the curled Ram horns, but they are still pretty badass",49466,3
49467,I was not pleased with this dress when it arrived and I tried it on.,49467,3
49467,The neck portion is poorly made.,49467,3
49467,I am returning this dress.,49467,3
49468,These don't stay up as well as I would like.,49468,3
49468,The waist band rolls and cuts in to my stomach.,49468,3
49469,"Ok, looks like the pic",49469,3
49470,good for the money thin and baggy,49470,3
49471,These are ALL SILVER.,49471,3
49471,They do NOT have black hi lights like in the picture,49471,3
49473,it's ok but the lock cuff keeping coming out and getting loss,49473,3
49474,"If you are certain of your measurements, this corset fits perfectly.",49474,3
49474,Only reason I am giving 3 stars is because it is definitely NOT steel-boned.,49474,3
49474,"Foundation is plastic, but still sturdy.",49474,3
49475,The top mesh pocket busted within 2 weeks.,49475,3
49475,"Was looking forward to this bag, it just didn't hold up.",49475,3
49475,The bottom big pocket is good though.,49475,3
49476,"I'd like to find a design that does not have the legs, just normal bikini style.",49476,3
49476,They would be more comfortable.,49476,3
49476,I do like the material that these are made of though.,49476,3
49476,The size is a little bit small for a 6'  200lb normal build male.,49476,3
49478,It's a smaller sized hard shell wallet perfect for when you don't need to carry a bunch of credit cards or cash.,49478,3
49478,Only 3 stars because the case isn't flush when you close it and you have to manipulate it a bit to make the case close on all sides.,49478,3
49479,I didn't like the color on this much.,49479,3
49479,"It is more peachy than pink and I am a winter, so it doesn't look that good on me.",49479,3
49479,I also don't like the way it flares out.,49479,3
49479,It pronounces my tummy and is not very flattering.,49479,3
49479,"I think it would be fine for a tall, thin person or someone who has a large tummy that they want to be comfortable in a blouse.",49479,3
49479,I'll just wear it around the house on hot days when I want to look okay and be comfortable.,49479,3
49479,It's better than a T-shirt.,49479,3
49479,Otherwise it was fine and a good value.,49479,3
49479,No problems with the shipping or time getting it and the price seems a good value.,49479,3
49480,"there cute, more for a little girl than an adult woman who would normally  wear big and chucky jewelry",49480,3
49481,No where near being an xl.,49481,3
49481,Maybe in a children's???,49481,3
49481,"The material was fine, the coloring was nice, the length was as expected, But it is more like a size 7/8.",49481,3
49482,put it on and it had a hole in it.,49482,3
49482,Returned for full refund.,49482,3
49485,The suit fit much smaller than size and bust was with little coverage.,49485,3
49485,"But mostly, it was an irregular fit and I sent it back.",49485,3
49486,"Quality of the material isn't that great, but you get what you pay for.",49486,3
49487,Gave to my friends daughter..way too small,49487,3
49489,They are comfortable but cause bulges,49489,3
49490,"I have larger-than-average balls/sack and the ""modern fit"" really pushes against the taint because of that - not comfortable.",49490,3
49490,I was not too happy with these.,49490,3
49490,"Also, they emphasize my waist fat, which I did not like.",49490,3
49491,I ordered 1 size up but should've gone up 2 sizes.,49491,3
49492,This shirt is oddly sewen,49492,3
49493,The quality of the wallet is mediocre - the metal logo on the front is slightly skewed (not horizontal) and the back of the wallet was scratched already when I got it out of the box.,49493,3
49493,"The leather is quite thin and the magnetic lock is quite strong, so the lock threatens to tear the leather around it every time you open the wallet.",49493,3
49493,At that particular moment I just had my card details stolen - so I was in a hurry to get any RFID blocking wallet before a long international trip and didn't care much about the looks - so I didn't bother to return/exchange it.,49493,3
49493,"Now, a year later, it's still holding up - no more scratches, zippers are working fine and the lock hasn't torn the leather yet (although the leather is already stretched around the lock so I have to be extra careful to open it).",49493,3
49493,"But most importantly, it does block my cards.",49493,3
49493,I also got a passport holder from the same manufacturer and its quality seems to be okay.,49493,3
49494,"Unfortunately, these did not fit my size 10 feet at all.",49494,3
49494,"They ended just at my heel and were very tight on the top of my foot, cutting into my skin.",49494,3
49494,The refund process was smooth and painless so I certainly can't complain.,49494,3
49495,"Not as quality as the image shows, be sure to always read dimensions.",49495,3
49495,"My daughter did not, whereas I did so she expected the item to be larger than it actually is.",49495,3
49496,quality is nice but the fit is a little snug due to the elastic fit.,49496,3
49497,"Loved the look of the outfit, but the hat & boots where extremely large for a newborn.",49497,3
49500,It shows MUCH longer than it is.,49500,3
49500,Being a size 6-8 I expected the top to clear my hips.,49500,3
49500,"Cute, but good luck on the size chart",49500,3
49501,It doesn't seem as long on me as shown on the model.,49501,3
49502,"Broke quickly, not as long as expected.",49502,3
49503,"The shirt looks better than I expected, but it's too small.",49503,3
49503,It is too tight and not flowy at all like the photo.,49503,3
49503,I ordered a size bigger too since I didn't know what to expect.,49503,3
49504,"So, I originally bought these because I liked the color and design.",49504,3
49504,"I've been buying quite a bit of underwear recently on Amazon, so I'm taking into consideration some of those other purchases and how these stack up.",49504,3
49504,The fit is okay.,49504,3
49504,"I'm about a 30"" waist and for some reason I purchased the XXL.",49504,3
49504,I think anything smaller for me would have been uncomfortable for the banana and oranges (average size bananas and oranges).,49504,3
49504,"They do tend to ride up a little, which is annoying.",49504,3
49504,Final scouting report: these guys aren't quite ready for The Big Show (need a little more seasoning in triple-A ball).,49504,3
49505,The top is a little large - should have ordered medium.,49505,3
49506,the v neck is lower than I expected,49506,3
49508,This hat is smaller and the patch is higher up than in the picture.,49508,3
49508,It's fits pretty snug on my head.,49508,3
49508,I like my beanies to be looser and hang off my head more but this one is just too small for that.,49508,3
49509,Really like this dress but it was a bit smaller than expected.,49509,3
49510,"CUTE dress/top, but definitely runs on the small size.",49510,3
49510,I bought the XL and laughed when I opened it and held it up.,49510,3
49510,It fit my 12 year old who wears a size 1...,49510,3
49511,The quality was great but ot was way to big.,49511,3
49511,The size runs big.,49511,3
49512,It fits the description but assembly had much to be desired.,49512,3
49512,I had to take it apart and put it back together correctly.,49512,3
49512,Attention to detail was needed with this item.,49512,3
49513,"I like the fit, but the color looks more like navy blue than what the picture a pretty purple.",49513,3
49513,"I purchased this to match a skirt with purple in it, but putting the skirt up with this top it does not match.",49513,3
49513,"I was disappointed in the color, but I can still use the top.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bepei-Women-V-neck-Slimming-Ruffles-Short-Sleeve-Draped-Blouse-Empire-Waist-Tops/dp/B01D2H8QQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bepei Women V-neck Slimming Ruffles Short-Sleeve Draped Blouse Empire Waist Tops</a>",49513,3
49514,already ran out of battery and to change the battery...you have to disassemble the whole thing....not that great,49514,3
49515,It's more of a shirt on me than a dress.,49515,3
49515,"I'm 5'2 and 100lbs, with a D cup and i bought a M. It's still cute and I'll wear it with leggings but if i wear it as a dress my cheeks will show.",49515,3
49516,My daughter would not even show me how this looked on her it fit so weird.,49516,3
49517,They are fine for the price.,49517,3
49518,I love these but the post is a little too long,49518,3
49519,I was disappointed that the shaper didn't extend higher up the back.,49519,3
49519,"It pushed my back fat high, creating a fold near my bra line.",49519,3
49519,I stiill intend to wear it though.,49519,3
49519,It certainly gives me an hour glass figure.,49519,3
49519,"I really don't think it lifts my butt, but I was more interested in the way it holds my fat in.",49519,3
49519,"I just happen to have a lot of back fat, and it just pushes it up high.",49519,3
49519,"You should order a size bigger than you usually do, because it fits small.",49519,3
49520,"Kinda small, and wish it was better quality",49520,3
49521,Makes me look funny,49521,3
49522,The collar needs some pellon for it to remain in place as it tends to curl.,49522,3
49522,Other than this its a nice jacked.,49522,3
49523,It is for a preteen girl.,49523,3
49523,Strap has frayed thread upon receipt.,49523,3
49524,Does the job but it broke.,49524,3
49525,The fit was just right but would've liked the length to be longer.,49525,3
49525,It comes well above the knee which doesn't make it very period correct (1940-1950) for what I was wanting.,49525,3
49525,The material is lightweight .,49525,3
49525,Cute dress but don't know if I will ever wear it.,49525,3
49526,This dress fits perfectly except slightly longer but with some heels it's fine.,49526,3
49526,The quality is decent and is exactly as pictured.,49526,3
49526,Did not receive the free gift that was supposed to come with it.,49526,3
49527,This is a very nice shirt but it runs big.,49527,3
49528,My friend lovrs it!,49528,3
49529,"they are nice, but i take a small (29 inch waist) and the large is pretty snug.",49529,3
49529,"i am a bit disappointed with the chinese sizing system, as it is always difficult to choose the correct size.",49529,3
49530,"Decent bathing suit
The top was large and loose.",49530,3
49530,I am a 32dd and it was big around the bottom,49530,3
49531,"Overall the watch is very nice, but the band is very stiff.",49531,3
49531,"I have a smaller wrist, so it doesn't want to bend around my arm easily.",49531,3
49531,it forms more of an oval shape.,49531,3
49531,"If you have a larger wrist, it may not be an issue.",49531,3
49531,"It has a large face and is kind of chunky, so it is better for larger wrist.",49531,3
49531,"Cute color, and well made.",49531,3
49532,I'm tiny and short and this shirt was small on me.,49532,3
49532,I'd order one or even two sizes up unless you want a really cropped and tight shirt,49532,3
49533,Keeps your watch alive but doesn't charge it enough to keep it charger.,49533,3
49534,I like the design but the bag was much smaller than it appeared in the ad.,49534,3
49535,"Definitely plus size enough to actually fit a 20/22 US, however they lose their shape very quickly and become saggy after very little wear.",49535,3
49535,Not bad for the price.,49535,3
49536,I ordered a Large and the bottoms fit great however the top was still a bit too big.,49536,3
49536,I even gave the top to my friend who is a little fuller than me and it fits like a loose sports bra.,49536,3
49536,"At standing everything is good, but movement and you got some loose flying gals.",49536,3
49536,I am a 36DD on top.,49536,3
49537,Believe the other reviews that say this runs larger than expected.,49537,3
49537,"I love the fabric it is so smooth and comfortable, really a great weight.",49537,3
49537,Would order agin but just smaller full size down.,49537,3
49538,Little tight & short but I'll keep,49538,3
49540,have to manual put wheel back in,49540,3
49541,"Need to exchange for larger size, ordered medium and it is much too small.",49541,3
49541,"Other dresses from other sellers in medium size were perfect, but the medium from this seller is not a normal medium",49541,3
49542,The shirt is beatiful but fit a little crocked but it still a great but for the price.,49542,3
49543,"The chain broke after a year of constant use, but the metal was repairable with a little bit of work on it.",49543,3
49543,My fiance liked it.,49543,3
49544,"This really is a cute outfit, but runs very small.",49544,3
49544,"I would have ordered a size up if it was better quality, but I ended up returning it.",49544,3
49545,"it has paddings inside, however it is a bit small
and because you tie the neck and also the back part, it might be easy to untie and open",49545,3
49546,"like most all Ralph Lauren, it runs small",49546,3
49547,Do not like it,49547,3
49548,"I love the size of the bag, the shape of the bag...everything about it BUT THE TERRIBLE CHEMICAL SMELL!!!!",49548,3
49548,Maybe it's the fact that it's stronger on the blue and red dyes?,49548,3
49548,But it has been over a week since I received the bag and I still can't use it because the smell is just overpowering and I refuse to put my wallet or any other item in there until it dissipates!,49548,3
49548,Please note: I sat the bag outside in fresh air for 3 days straight and the smell is STILL not gone.,49548,3
49548,I have it currently stuffed with dryer sheets in the hopes that they will absorb the awful stench.,49548,3
49548,I'm disappointed by the smell.,49548,3
49549,the top was way too small,49549,3
49550,the paint peeled right away,49550,3
49551,Material is very thin...,49551,3
49551,I love the length because I'm very tall,49551,3
49552,"I ordered a size small and the bottoms were too small for me, i am 5' and 105lbs.",49552,3
49553,LIke the fit but the fabric rides up at the bottom.,49553,3
49554,"Very pretty dress, but not as stunning as I had anticipated.",49554,3
49555,I ordered a xl and it is too small.,49555,3
49555,"It will fit my sister, and it seems like it is quality made.",49555,3
49555,The color is great.,49555,3
49555,Order a couple sizes bigger if you buy this.,49555,3
49556,"A little smaller than expected, and the lace part is very itchy.",49556,3
49556,"Other than that, very nice nightgown and robe for the price.",49556,3
49557,Nice silky material and it fit perfectly.,49557,3
49557,I didn't really like the fact that the print of Marilyn on the front is also on the back and you can tell it was thrown together.,49557,3
49557,I could have made this myself honestly.,49557,3
49557,Isn't bad for the price.,49557,3
49558,First one I got was defective and the company replaced it.,49558,3
49558,"The second works better, but still occasionally comes unlocked.",49558,3
49559,Small for a 7.,49559,3
49560,not exactly large but more so just didn't fit the way it does in the picture but it's probably photoshopped anyway.,49560,3
49560,the front looks perfect and adorable.,49560,3
49560,"the back doesn't cling to your body like it shows, it is loose and looks very awkward.",49560,3
49560,I think i can sew it and fix it but idk.,49560,3
49560,haven't worn it yet bc the back just ruins it imo,49560,3
49561,Fine quality product but when ordering from this company size must order at much larger size than usual.,49561,3
49562,The size is much smaller than expected,49562,3
49563,You get what you pay for so I can't be too upset that this product pulls across my bust area.,49563,3
49563,It's not awful but I prefer it to be a bit baggier as the picture shows.,49563,3
49563,"So anybody above a C-cup, beware that your sweater will pull.",49563,3
49563,The quality is okay but the sleeves are tight so pushing them up isn't really an option.,49563,3
49563,"I do like the colors and washing it without having to send it to the dry cleaner but if I had the option to purchase this again, I would turn it down.",49563,3
49564,I bought the xl and usually wear a size 14.,49564,3
49564,It was so tight i couldn't even put it on.,49564,3
49564,Even if I had ordered an xxl it still wouldn't have fit.,49564,3
49564,My daughter wears a size 9 dress and it fit her perfect.,49564,3
49565,Love this...very comfortable..a tad thin..great as a dress or as a top with leggings,49565,3
49566,"Love the skirt, but the shirt is very sheer and see thru.",49566,3
49566,"Was going to use it for her birthday party, but have to use something else in place of the shirt.",49566,3
49567,Cute sweater but too small.,49567,3
49567,I'm 5'7 and 150 lbs.,49567,3
49567,the xl was too snug for me.,49567,3
49567,The material doesn't seem like it would be very warm.,49567,3
49568,It's pretty but thin material and too small.,49568,3
49568,Ordered the largest they had and normally I fit a 1X or 2x US.,49568,3
49568,Scared it will rip putting on and off.,49568,3
49568,The sizes need readjusting.,49568,3
49568,The wait is long enough as it is and then to get it and not be able to wear it is disappointing.,49568,3
49571,I unfortunately had to return them because right when I opened them the finger hole was ripped off of the wings but I loved them they were so cute wish they were a little more sturdy .,49571,3
49572,Nice feel but somewhat on the small side,49572,3
49574,Nice design but very thin and not worth putting out side.,49574,3
49574,better for use in a bathroom or some place like it so that it will last longer.,49574,3
49574,Ink work on mat is nicely done with no flaking so far after three months of use.,49574,3
49575,This is a nice addition to my wardrobe when I want to dress it up.,49575,3
49575,It's not the highest quality but will serve it's purpose for a while; worth the small amount of money I paid for it.,49575,3
49576,This bolo tie is beautiful minus the cord it is on.,49576,3
49576,The ends are gold while the pendant is silver.,49576,3
49576,And the cord is also not leather.,49576,3
49576,So we had to get another cord that matched it better.,49576,3
49577,"Top fit okay, but the bottoms were way too small.",49577,3
49577,Bought for my daughter who has always fitted perfectly into any small size swim suit.,49577,3
49577,Afraid to return to get a larger size and then the top would be too big.,49577,3
49577,She just wears the top with another suit bottom.,49577,3
49578,"My bracelet broke the day I got it, BUT.. it was $3, so what can I expect.",49578,3
49578,I put it back together pretty easily.,49578,3
49579,"I had high hopes for this dress, but sadly it wasn't up to the same quality as the Homeyee dress I ordered at the same time.",49579,3
49579,This one would work well for a slim woman or a teen.,49579,3
49579,"It probably would also work with a good, tight body suit on underneath, but I don't really like being forced into a body suit.",49579,3
49579,The material is just too thin to hold a good shape (seemed baggy in some places) or to be forgiving if you're in the over-40 crowd.,49579,3
49579,"I ordered an XXL based on the other comments about sizing, but I would normally wear a U.S. size 10.",49579,3
49579,"The color and design were very nice, but had to return it.",49579,3
49580,Very pretty but not true to size.,49580,3
49580,I'm a 16-18 and got a 2xl.,49580,3
49580,It's extremely too small.,49580,3
49580,I'm not sure that even a 3xl would fit.,49580,3
49581,Nice length and design but too shiny for me.,49581,3
49581,I'm letting it tarnish before I wear it.,49581,3
49582,"It fit loose and wasn't as wide as I would have liked, but still wearable.",49582,3
49583,The shipping was quick.,49583,3
49583,"Worked great the first few times, however now the lights are very dim.",49583,3
49583,"Yes, it was charged.",49583,3
49584,not well made...but its okay,49584,3
49585,I love how the make my butt look and feel.,49585,3
49585,However the loop in the front that is supposed to hold my 'parts' won't stay in place and I end up 'falling out'.,49585,3
49586,"The gloves are lined, which makes them a little tight for one size fits all, but warm.",49586,3
49586,"But I have only worn them a couple times, and there is a spot already starting to unravel.",49586,3
49586,Not worth returning though.,49586,3
49587,Runs extremely small and the size only goes to large.,49587,3
49587,It fits more like a medium.,49587,3
49587,Don't bother if you wear larger than a medium!,49587,3
49588,The fit was okay.,49588,3
49588,It's not a bad product.,49588,3
49588,What I wasn't in love with was the bra pads that moved around a lot.,49588,3
49588,"Plus, I definitely had muffin top in the swimsuit.",49588,3
49588,I was hoping for an athletic fit and I got more of a prepubescent look going on.,49588,3
49588,"I ended up sending it back, but I do like the brand and the affordability of the suit.",49588,3
49588,I think that if you have a square shaped figure it would work well.,49588,3
49588,If you have a lot of cleavage of butt you may want to a) order a few sizes up and b) go with a more figure flattering suit.,49588,3
49590,I do not know how well it will hold up.,49590,3
49590,But it is nice.,49590,3
49591,Really cute romper for the price.,49591,3
49591,"However, it's incredibly short and the strap broke the second time I wore it.",49591,3
49592,I received my Coach Signature PVC Double Bill Wallet.,49592,3
49592,It arrived problem free.,49592,3
49592,"I guess I will have to wait for a few months, to see if it changes color occurs.",49592,3
49592,The last Coach ID wallet I purchased has not faded.,49592,3
49592,"Buying, this wallet is a good deal, but I have noticed that some of the stitching is tearing around the edges of the wallet.",49592,3
49593,Very thin but worked great to wear at the beach.,49593,3
49594,I am an xl in America and it still fitted very small,49594,3
49595,Not bad for the price ....,49595,3
49597,I would say to go up two sizes not one.,49597,3
49599,"Quality isn't so great, and I'll have to try to use heat to make it more snug on my face - it currently wings out wide to either side and is made of a very stiff plastic.",49599,3
49599,But the lace is a lovely pattern.,49599,3
49600,"I need to make some adjustments to the chain, but it is OK.",49600,3
49601,"My daughter had trouble keeping them on her feet, but they were exactly what she wanted.",49601,3
49601,I wait until she's oler to purchase another pair (she's 6 years old),49601,3
49603,It fits well but didn't work well in terms of style.,49603,3
49603,So i had to return it.,49603,3
49603,Nothing wrong with the product.,49603,3
49604,"These are made very cheaply, but look kind of ok...",49604,3
49604,"I want expecting a whole lot for the price, but I was expecting a little better...",49604,3
49604,It looks like they cut a plastic beaded necklace and just glued it on the end of a tunnel.,49604,3
49605,"Very pretty dress, but does not ""give"" at all.",49605,3
49605,I also found it to be a little smaller than average.,49605,3
49606,"Ordered a size up, fit was fine but the sleeves were more like 3/4 length.",49606,3
49606,Took two stars off since I was expecting the sleeves to be long like the picture implies.,49606,3
49607,"Shirt is decent quality, color is true to picture.",49607,3
49607,The crochet on mine is bright white and not off-white like I thought.,49607,3
49607,Also the edges of the crocheted pieces aren't sewed down so I'm going to throw a couple of stitches around the edges to keep them down.,49607,3
49608,"Ball bag too tight,otherwise fit good.",49608,3
49609,Feels a bit small.,49609,3
49609,Material is nice but the way it was packed made it wrinkled.,49609,3
49609,I'm not the best at tying pretty bows so I was sad that the bow doesn't come already done.,49609,3
49609,It's an ok shirt.,49609,3
49610,Not made on the USA.,49610,3
49610,Kind of price up.,49610,3
49610,Delivery charge way to expensive.,49610,3
49611,"It was ok, but nothing incredible.",49611,3
49611,"Would probably be adorable on anyone that is smaller, but definitely not for plus size women.",49611,3
49612,This dress fits well with good colors as shown in the pic.,49612,3
49612,Only down side is the fabric is a very thick non-breathable polyester with no stretch.,49612,3
49612,It can get really hot and heavy.,49612,3
49613,It's cute but the sleeves aren't long enough,49613,3
49614,They did not shrink.,49614,3
49614,Shoold have bought it in my size.,49614,3
49615,3 because I assume it is a comfortable shirt but I got a large and I was so small that I gave it to a friend that is a medium and it was tight on him.,49615,3
49616,does not fit like the model iswearing very disappointed giving to my step daughter,49616,3
49617,So far I'm not that happy as the bracelet has fallen off three or four times.,49617,3
49617,I would recommend a chain safety put on as to not lose it.,49617,3
49617,"As far as if the stones will stay sparkly, only time will tell.",49617,3
49619,It was a good fit but tarnishes easily,49619,3
49621,The outfit was not stitched properly....but the outfit would be really great light wieght...had not been for that ..,49621,3
49622,"Pretty, but too small.",49622,3
49622,I gave it to my daughter.,49622,3
49622,"Also, the back side is very skimpy.",49622,3
49623,See thru but cute.,49623,3
49624,Pretty disappointed that I ONLY received HALF MY ORDER!,49624,3
49624,"I purchased for BOTH pairs and only received the hearts, which btw I do LOVE THEM!",49624,3
49624,They're comfortable and fit perfect.,49624,3
49624,"However, the company was absolutely wonderful and refunded for items because of the mistake.",49624,3
49624,I would purchase again to give them another chance since their customer service was good & ON TOP OF IT RIGHT AWAY!,49624,3
49625,SO LARGE THEY FELL OFF,49625,3
49626,"The material is gorgeous and vintage looking, but the size XS is huge.",49626,3
49626,"I am 5' 4"" and 105 with a small frame, but with a C cup.",49626,3
49626,I would have had to dramatically reduced the torso to make it fit.,49626,3
49627,This shirt is tiny and the lettering looks like it was put on in 2 pieces so it reads really wierd.,49627,3
49627,I will say shipping was very fast and the shirt is soft.,49627,3
49628,So and so...to thin..,49628,3
49629,The quality is okay but the size is easily a step too small.,49629,3
49629,Order one size larger to ensure a fit.,49629,3
49631,"The bottoms weren't low rise like the photo, they went up so high in the back it was awful.",49631,3
49631,The top was too small (side boob) and not supportive around the band.,49631,3
49631,"I would only recommend this to those with A, B, or (perky) C cups.",49631,3
49631,"The pattern is only printed on white fabric, so when the top stretches, you see white underneath.",49631,3
49631,"But I wasn't expecting it to be awesome, it was $8.",49631,3
49631,Not worth the return.,49631,3
49632,Knew it would be short.,49632,3
49632,Kept it due to being such a nice product.,49632,3
49633,Very cute suit though.,49633,3
49634,I ordered a Large- it was too small around my boobs.,49634,3
49635,Runs a lil small,49635,3
49636,I really love this coat but it tore after just a few wears.,49636,3
49636,I had it restitched but that was disappointing.,49636,3
49637,these dresses are way to big.,49637,3
49637,I ordered 3 and every one of them was too large.,49637,3
49637,the dress is beautiful though.,49637,3
49638,beautiful dress in the picture not so beautiful on.,49638,3
49639,Coat is cute but runs small.,49639,3
49639,"Should purchase a size larger than you usually wear and even then, it is small through the shoulders.",49639,3
49640,It's ok but it doesn't fit my apparently larger than Extra Large head.,49640,3
49640,Frustrating to try to find a hat that fits.,49640,3
49641,For polyester its ok.,49641,3
49641,I needed it for a red/black costume party and it did the job.,49641,3
49642,Was suitable for 1st birthday costume for which was purchased.,49642,3
49642,The assembly and material of this outfit would not be suitable as something I would expect to endure day to day usage.,49642,3
49643,The light is very bright...,49643,3
49644,Within a week is so tarnished and broke super easily.,49644,3
49644,It's cute for like a rare accessory,49644,3
49645,The hat was very cheap and hard to get shaped back right to look right to wear.,49645,3
49645,We bought this for a 20s dinner and it did complete the look.,49645,3
49645,I just wish each piece was a little better made.,49645,3
49646,"There are two main aspects to sock suspenders: the elasticity of the strap that goes around your leg, and the strength and ease of use of the clip that attaches to the sock.",49646,3
49646,"These suspenders got the elasticity part right, but skimped on the clip.",49646,3
49646,The elastic strap is tight and well made.,49646,3
49646,"Unfortunately, the snap that attaches to the sock is tiny and comes apart quite easily.",49646,3
49646,Mine came apart after one wear.,49646,3
49646,"I was able to get it back together, but I doubt it will last more than a few wearings.",49646,3
49647,"Size barely fits an adult's shoulders, unsure how this is a kid's helmet.",49647,3
49647,Quality is great though.,49647,3
49648,"The size is right, I like the style (the way it drapes and all) and the material is nice...it's just a little longer than I prefer.",49648,3
49648,Being a short girl this shirt comes to mid-thigh and makes me look shorter than normal,49648,3
49649,I loved this dress initially.,49649,3
49649,However after a few wears noticed the material started to pill,49649,3
49651,"If you need a well made costume, this coat would be great.",49651,3
49651,I was expecting it to be more like a normal jacket but it is something I could definitely only wear on halloween.,49651,3
49651,"I wear a large size, ordered a 3x and it fit fine.",49651,3
49652,"The earnings were pretty and appeared well made, but the pink color is so light in color that it really looked white.",49652,3
49652,You had to really study it under a bright light to be able to see any hue of pink.,49652,3
49652,The color is nothing like it is  pictured here...much...much...lighter in color.,49652,3
49652,If you truly want pink....I suggest you look elsewhere.,49652,3
49653,"they for sure work for my husbands Dr boots, but they could be even bestir if they were about 4-6 inches longer",49653,3
49654,Color is not what I expected...was at brighter pink,49654,3
49655,Gave it to my cousin as a bday gift she love it she is a size small to medium.,49655,3
49655,I ordered a large I wear a size 7-9,49655,3
49656,Shipped back quality wasn't that great,49656,3
49657,I like the fit.,49657,3
49658,Bought these to use in place of a bra.,49658,3
49658,Did not work for that.,49658,3
49658,The are more an enhancement to make you appear larger.,49658,3
49658,Did not work as a bra for a backless dress.,49658,3
49659,I don't know if these have a coating on them or if they contain something other than just acrylic.,49659,3
49659,I bought them to replace the black acrylic 10 g spiral tapers that eventually became too small.,49659,3
49659,They fell out and I was only able to find one of them.,49659,3
49659,"The 3 mm/8 g fit fine, but soon after I put them in I started getting itchy all over my body (no redness or hives) and eventually my throat started to feel constricted.",49659,3
49659,I took Benadryl and removed the earrings.,49659,3
49659,"When I woke up I still felt itchy, but my skin tends to be itchy in the winter anyway.",49659,3
49659,"I washed the earrings in antibacterial soap and put them back in to confirm if they were the cause; the itching intensified and my throat started to tighten up again (no trouble breathing either time, luckily).",49659,3
49659,"They seem like they'd be durable, but I wasn't able to wear them long enough to give an honest review on that aspect.",49659,3
49660,ran smaller than other items of this size,49660,3
49661,"They're look really nice, however they do feel a little bit small on my 10 month old.",49661,3
49661,I would have ordered her a size bigger.,49661,3
49661,They slide off my daughters feet easily and I feel like the material will wear out pretty quickly.,49661,3
49662,Really doesn't offer support,49662,3
49664,a lot of the hooks came loose so it was hard to put on and keep it on - I ended up throwing it away,49664,3
49665,"Small in size, but good quality",49665,3
49666,"They were way too large for me, and I was going to send them back.",49666,3
49666,"But my daughter, who is taller and bigger decided she wanted them, so I gave them to her.",49666,3
49667,The design of this case is my favorite part.,49667,3
49667,It also protects my phone very well when the phone is dropped.,49667,3
49667,The flip portion of the case does not work very well and you can only put 2 card OR money in.,49667,3
49667,If you add more it does not close well.,49667,3
49667,After a few months the closer is already wearing out and I expect it will be breaking soon.,49667,3
49668,"Beautiful ring, but was not size 7, so i gave it to my daughter",49668,3
49669,I really like the style the hat and it looks very good however the middle part hurts my head when I wear it.,49669,3
49670,Seeing this picture I thought it would be nice...,49670,3
49670,I tried the tank on and the length  is a bit long  for my taste and it made me look shorter than I am.,49670,3
49670,"The tank is stretchy and thin,so, if you have that dreaded  muffin top, extra spillage in the tummy (gut) and abs then this isn't the top, it will reveal the lumps and bumps you want to hide.",49670,3
49670,I gave to the donation bag at our church ( we collect clean clothes people don't want and give them to people in need).,49670,3
49670,"The website says 70% polyester and 30% cotton, but I feel there is lycra added ...",49670,3
49670,I might be wrong.,49670,3
49670,XXL fits more like a missy XL.,49670,3
49670,"If you like flowy then this isn't for you, but if you like clinging to all the lumps and bumps then get it.",49670,3
49670,"If i didn't have that muffin top and my gut overhang a bit, it would fit nice.",49670,3
49672,Its okay but it has not held its luster like I thought it should have.,49672,3
49672,I would not purchase it again I know.,49672,3
49673,"Cute graphic, but fits small.",49673,3
49673,It's a material I would expect for a workout shirt and fits tight.,49673,3
49674,I bought this dress post-partum to attend a wedding and be able to nurse discretely.,49674,3
49674,I am very small busted and still had trouble nursing as the opening was a bit small and tight.,49674,3
49674,It did the trick but wasn't the most convenient.,49674,3
49674,"Also, it looked a little more maternity than I had hoped....",49674,3
49676,Comes in a nice box.,49676,3
49676,The construction seems too flimsy to be keeping in your back pants pocket.,49676,3
49676,The metal is too thin.,49676,3
49676,I can hear it make a pop noise when I sit down as the cover shifts position.,49676,3
49676,Over time it will get bent and the latch and hinges may develop problems.,49676,3
49676,I don't trust it and need something stronger than this.,49676,3
49676,Keeping it in the front pants pocket would be fine if I didn't have keys and a phone already.,49676,3
49676,Edges are rounded but there are still points to them that might wear into fabric over time.,49676,3
49676,Overall for the money it is OK but I isn't going to meet my needs.,49676,3
49676,"Willing to spend more, for better.",49676,3
49677,"Love this, but it is very thin and poorly made.",49677,3
49677,"I had to sew a section where the seem came loose after it's first wash, and the under part rolls up constantly and is very thin.",49677,3
49677,I always have to wear a white tank underneath because it is so shear.,49677,3
49678,"Item is good for the most part, but the waist band is for like a -0 size.",49678,3
49678,The rest of the plant is good.,49678,3
49679,VERY thin;but on a hot humid day...it will feel GREAT,49679,3
49680,Trying to stretch it on a bowl...  Too small for my husbands big head,49680,3
49681,Bigger then what I thought but overall happy.,49681,3
49682,It fit nicely and is a cute outfit  .. But- the bow tie was seen down MUCh lower than pictured.,49682,3
49683,"I am 5'6"" and 140, and these fit  fine, though they were a little long.",49683,3
49683,"I was disappointed in the lace edging, it does not stay up well but wants to roll.",49683,3
49683,"Additionally, one of the pairs immediately ran in both legs the first time they were put on(and I always bunch them first to avoid toenail accidents, so it wasn't that!)",49683,3
49684,way too small but otherwise awesome.,49684,3
49685,This is a canvas wallet that is DINGY looking.,49685,3
49685,Definitely not worth the cost!!!,49685,3
49686,Quality seemed good but the Large was teeny for this American who wears medium to large.,49686,3
49686,Luckily I had a very petite friend visiting so I gave it it to her and everyone was happy.,49686,3
49687,"This dress is lovely, but there are a few drawbacks to it.",49687,3
49687,First there is fabric on the inside around the color that shows through the dress.,49687,3
49687,It's not a big deal but could be irritating to look a in the mirror.,49687,3
49687,Second the dress is a bit larger than I expected.,49687,3
49687,"I expected it to be large because of the type of dress it is, but it does almost appear as if you are wearing a shirt that's too big for you.",49687,3
49687,That being said I like it enough to keep it as it is a really nice dress.,49687,3
49688,Fit like a mans t shirt.,49688,3
49688,Not very feminine at all like it said in the description but it's still cute.,49688,3
49689,"The fabric is VERY stiff, but after a few washes it got softer.",49689,3
49689,"It's a little tight, but not uncomfortable.",49689,3
49689,I bought this for the shirt and threw the necklace in the trash.,49689,3
49690,Item received as described well packed and fast shipping.,49690,3
49690,The shirt is very nice but the material is very thin.,49690,3
49691,This is a very nice Watch.,49691,3
49691,mine came with a very small scratch but still very nice looking.,49691,3
49691,It seem to be keeping good time and all functions work.,49691,3
49691,Also the included instructions were easy to understand.,49691,3
49691,This came with no box but was well protected.,49691,3
49691,Band adjustment took some muscle and finesse.,49691,3
49691,Update: Button came off after second day of use.,49691,3
49691,I was able to push it back on but it continues to fall off Daily.,49691,3
49691,I decided not to wear this daily.,49691,3
49692,The length was perfect since I'm only 5'2.,49692,3
49692,But it was too tight for my legs..,49692,3
49693,"Super happy and impressed, I would recommend this product to everyone!",49693,3
49694,The fit is great but the material itself is not comfortable compared to the other 4 Elan Tunics I own.,49694,3
49694,It's more scratchy to be honest but I do luv the color scheme.,49694,3
49694,The shipping was fast & packing was great.,49694,3
49694,I only give 3 stars b/c of the feel of the material,49694,3
49695,"""You get what you pay for.""",49695,3
49696,"Great T, just a little too large and mediums never fit me.",49696,3
49696,"Also, I don't really like the heavy plastic designs on T-shirts.",49696,3
49696,"I had a shirt with the same symbol, but clockwork orange symbol was a little smaller and was actually more part of the shirt rather than heavy plastic.",49696,3
49697,I guess some manufacturers size different than others.,49697,3
49698,A little small and poorly made.,49698,3
49700,It came in a reasonable time.,49700,3
49700,I ordered the XXL for my father.,49700,3
49700,"I wear XL, tried it on to make sure it would it him, but was too tight for me.",49700,3
49700,They were very accommodating my return; so thank you very much!,49700,3
49700,"If it were possible to get a larger than their labeled XXL, I would have done it.",49700,3
49700,I guess their sizing is different than ours.,49700,3
49700,"But it was a very, very nice shirt.",49700,3
49701,the item comes easily apart!!!,49701,3
49702,The costume look so much nicer on the picture.,49702,3
49702,"When I received it I was a little disappointed at the quality, but still a head-turner at halloween!",49702,3
49703,It's halfway in your armpit.,49703,3
49703,"If you want it to fit like in the picture, order 2 sizes up.",49703,3
49704,The very first day my so the pants a hole appeared right between the legs.,49704,3
49704,"I was mildly dissapointed, but I assumed maybe he was just being to rough in his clothes.",49704,3
49704,Sewed them up and sure enough the second time he wore them another hole formed right between the legs.,49704,3
49705,It fits...kinda.. it's a little small for the size I ordered.,49705,3
49705,"Also the lace is barely attached to the shirt, seems sewn on strange, but it works..",49705,3
49705,"I was kind of hoping for a better product, but I will probably wear it, or I'll pass it to someone who can.",49705,3
49706,Even though the description states it's for women with petite wrists it's quite large.,49706,3
49706,I was debating on returning it because without the hair tie it would actually fall off.,49706,3
49706,It will bend with effort so I was able to make it slightly smaller.,49706,3
49706,It holds my hair ties perfectly though!,49706,3
49706,"Compared to other brands, the price is also great.",49706,3
49706,It's sturdy to say the least as I had trouble bending it without help.,49706,3
49707,The pattern on this top is quite pretty but the top is very large and swallowed me up.,49707,3
49707,I'm gifting it to someone who is a large-sized person.,49707,3
49707,Took a very long time to receive it as well.,49707,3
49707,Not pleased with the shipping time.,49707,3
49707,Still it is a nice looking top but would be better for larger women.,49707,3
49708,Shirt was a bit oversized for my 9 year old.,49708,3
49708,It was shipped a week after expected delivery date.,49708,3
49709,The dress fits but the sleeves are too small for me.,49709,3
49710,These are okay for the price.,49710,3
49710,"They're a good color and decently opaque, but they're not very elastic.",49710,3
49710,They sort of stretch out while wearing them and then bunch around the ankles a bit.,49710,3
49710,"If I was taller maybe this wouldn't happen, but I still think they could be tighter/stretchier, like some higher-quality tights.",49710,3
49710,"Not my favorite, but I haven't put a run in them yet so that's a plus.",49710,3
49711,As a huge Victorias Secret fan I decided to branch out and give these panties a try.,49711,3
49711,The bubble envelope they arrived in was filthy (no fault of the seller though).,49711,3
49711,"They look good, except a couple pairs had loose strands that caused pulls in the lace.",49711,3
49711,"As for the fit, they fit tight in the waist but rather long in the crotch area.",49711,3
49711,"Mind you, I usually wear Victorias, so I am used to a shorter crotch style.",49711,3
49711,I gave 3 stars because of the loose threads and the hard to remove tags that cause damage if removed wrong.,49711,3
49712,Nice Jacket way too small.,49712,3
49713,Good shirt for the price.,49713,3
49713,Beware you get what you pay for.,49713,3
49713,Material seems somewhat cheap but shirt fit well.,49713,3
49713,Advise to hang dry or dry clean,49713,3
49714,"Overly large but, cute with an updo hair style.",49714,3
49716,The product itself is fine.,49716,3
49716,"It was delivered two days later than the estimated shipping day (the reason I gave 3 stars), but that wasn't a big deal to me.",49716,3
49716,My biggest problem is that I was planning to use this as a replacement band for my Fitbit Blaze.,49716,3
49716,I needed a fabric band because the rubber band that came with my fitness watch was causing a skin reaction.,49716,3
49716,"I confirmed that the size was the same, and that this band came with the little pins that would allow me to run this band through the pins attached to the watch.",49716,3
49716,What I discovered when I received the band though is that it is too think.,49716,3
49716,The band won't squeeze between the pin and the back on the watch itself because the fabric isn't thin enough to fit through.,49716,3
49716,"I figured it would cost more to ship it back than I had paid for it, so I just wrote it off as a loss.",49716,3
49716,"Not a reflection of the product itself, but I wanted to mention in case anyone else was thinking of using this product on their Blaze.",49716,3
49717,"Very pretty ring, but one of the stones fell out the second day of wearing it.",49717,3
49717,"The company was great about replacing it, but I will have to wait and see how the quality of the new one is.",49717,3
49718,I only got one 6g plug and the back of the 6g tunnel broke in half while I was wearing it but these are great they do what they need to.,49718,3
49720,This is cute but its a little large.,49720,3
49720,I ordered a M and it's slightly too baggy in the back portion.,49720,3
49720,"I am 5'6 and my measurements are 39-29-40, I usually wear a size 8 in pants and 6 in dresses.",49720,3
49720,"The back strap also broke (the plastic part fell off) just after trying it on but I just turned it into a halter so it wasn't a big deal, that's why it looks so different in my picture.",49720,3
49720,Overall it is a cute romper though.,49720,3
49721,Was not very well made.,49721,3
49722,"Too tight in the crutch, legs too long, very narrow at the knees, could hardly bend them.",49722,3
49723,The description say gray with mirror but  the  eyeshield is only gray,49723,3
49724,Ordered an XL - it was way too small and I usually take a size 12.,49724,3
49725,"This blouse is very pretty, but it fits very oddly.",49725,3
49725,"I'm a tall woman and have a problem with tops being too short, but this one is wide and short.",49725,3
49726,"Is soft in the chest region but feels weird around the arms, the strings are like rope..",49726,3
49726,"But its cute, mine is a little big",49726,3
49727,"Socks are nice, but definitely a little too small for a normal sized man.",49727,3
49727,Would better fit women or men with size 10 feet or smaller.,49727,3
49728,Get a bigger size because they are cut small,49728,3
49729,Wore it once and the snap broke off.,49729,3
49730,I guess it's ok. 3 start for me,49730,3
49731,"It says order a size up, but it ended up being too big for me when it arrived.",49731,3
49732,"The dress is cute, it just didn't fit my body right.",49732,3
49732,"I only gave it 3 stars because i bought a red one, same company, same size,very, very similar and it fit perfect.",49732,3
49733,Only reason gave it a three star is the gold is starting to fade already.,49733,3
49734,A good gift for a child,49734,3
49735,Material is somehow cheap .,49735,3
49735,The sizes r not accurate.... U have to buy larger size than u wear .,49735,3
49736,Awesome pair of jeans for the price.,49736,3
49736,I suggest washing these jeans twice before wearing them.,49736,3
49736,They are dyed pretty heavily.,49736,3
49736,The first couple times I wore mine (even after washing) my legs turned blue.,49736,3
49737,"I'm on the lookout for breezy pants to wear for the summer as I work in the southwest, and I thought this would do the trick.",49737,3
49737,"I'm 155 lbs at 5'7"" with an athletic build and the medium was too small for me.",49737,3
49737,"The prints are fun and bright, and I wish they would have fit.",49737,3
49737,"I'd like to add that these will have to be altered as each pants are various sizes, so factoring that into the cost of $30 pants, I don't know I'd recommend them.",49737,3
49738,If you like the arm openings at mid chest this is the one for you.,49738,3
49738,"I was disappointed , the photos do not show reality.",49738,3
49739,"The top in the picture looks very form-fitting, so I ordered a size up, but in fact it's rather loose (as stated in other reviews).",49739,3
49739,"I'm 5'2"" 118lbs, normally wear a small in tops but size up in tight tanks if I don't want them to be too clingy.",49739,3
49739,"The Medium tank I received was very big and loose with lots of extra material at the back, which was disappointing.",49739,3
49739,"So, if you want it to look like the picture I suggest you don't size up.",49739,3
49739,"Cute style, though, might re-order a smaller one.",49739,3
49740,Dont like it the front falls flat on my sons forehead so he can't see and he hates it.,49740,3
49740,I had to get another one.,49740,3
49741,This dress is very pretty but it's so very short!,49741,3
49741,If I wore it as a dress I'd be arrested.,49741,3
49741,"It will make a pretty long top, but the t doesn't cover even half-way down my butt.",49741,3
49741,Might be good if you're extremely petite/short.,49741,3
49742,The suit is waaaay too small.,49742,3
49742,Should have paid more attention to the reviews.,49742,3
49742,"I like it a little snug, but I couldn't even begin to get it on.",49742,3
49742,The sizing chart is way off.,49742,3
49742,Should be an Asian sizing chart not American.,49742,3
49742,The quality and look of the suit didn't look that bad for the 3 minutes it took to realize it didn't fit.,49742,3
49743,cute but kind of cheap,49743,3
49744,Upper part fitted as expected but too short.,49744,3
49744,"The dress description says knee length, but the order when placed said mini.",49744,3
49745,Skirt is very sheer and could not be worn with tights alone.,49745,3
49746,I need to talk to someone that work here.,49746,3
49746,I just got the item 2 weeks ago and the lock is already messed up.,49746,3
49746,I only have in there 5 cards and 3 bills.,49746,3
49746,"On Thursday when I used the wallet to get my credit card, the lock does not want to open!",49746,3
49746,I pushed really hard with my fingers and wallet still won't open.,49746,3
49746,I did not pay 20 dollars for a wallet that is not working.,49746,3
49746,Please give me a call or send me a message to talk about this.,49746,3
49746,The only reason I buy this because it have good ratings and reviews but the item is not working.,49746,3
49747,Colors are very nice together.,49747,3
49747,"Took a long time to get, and is shorter than I would like though.",49747,3
49747,Would go nice with a higher collared shirt.,49747,3
49748,"shirt quality good, size as expected, but actual design is about 1/2 the size of the picture.",49748,3
49749,"The fitting was fine, I ordered a small and I'm 5'3""  and 100 pounds, the only thing I had a problem with was that it was completely transparent, and in the picture it looks like a thicker cloth/fabric.",49749,3
49750,"Fits nicely and it's comfortable, but since there's no tacky strip along the hem, it does roll up some.",49750,3
49751,Good for kids ages 2 to 3 years old in my opinion.,49751,3
49752,"pretty shoes, looks like picture, but smaller than expected.",49752,3
49753,I bought this for my 2 year old son.,49753,3
49753,It runs very small in size.,49753,3
49753,I ordered a size 2T and it was more like a 12 month size.,49753,3
49753,The material was okay.,49753,3
49753,I returned it because it was obviously too small.,49753,3
49754,Ordered a small and was a little tight throughout.,49754,3
49754,Came down to right above my knees.,49754,3
49754,Material is thick and strong.,49754,3
49754,Top flap is a little akward so I just fold it under.,49754,3
49755,This was ordered for a soccer theme party.,49755,3
49755,The only problem- was a little small in size.,49755,3
49756,Came with some kind of stains on it..,49756,3
49757,"not really a sweater, more of a shirt.",49757,3
49758,I bought this for my granddaughter and I am having second thoughts.,49758,3
49758,It does not appear to be the quality fabric she would like so I will find someone else to give it to.,49758,3
49759,They were too small,49759,3
49761,"So I read through the reviews, and obviously, there is some confusion.",49761,3
49761,"A lot of people say the dress runs small and I'm starting to question how realistic they are because I truly am a medium, 36D bust 29 inch waist and 39 inches in the hips, I ordered up to a large, and it was....way too big.",49761,3
49761,I should have ordered a size down to the small.,49761,3
49761,It is absolutely huge,49761,3
49762,It's not dark blue.,49762,3
49762,It's a medium blue-purple color.,49762,3
49762,Still a cute belt.,49762,3
49762,Seems to be made well & can't beat the price.,49762,3
49762,Just happy I wasn't looking specifically for dark blue.,49762,3
49763,Rather expensive for what you get.,49763,3
49765,"The hat says ""Make America Great Again"", but it was made in China.",49765,3
49765,Hopefully this will change some day.,49765,3
49766,Very expensive but I love the color!!,49766,3
49766,"The bag does not close ( magnet, zipper, snap) always stays open and is very big.",49766,3
49766,Kind of a pain to use everyday.,49766,3
49767,Nice pants but size runs smaller than Carhartt jeans.,49767,3
49767,I ordered Carhartt jeans along with these and the jeans fit fine but these are too small.,49767,3
49768,This jump suite is ok.,49768,3
49768,I didn't like that color yellow.,49768,3
49768,It looks more better and bright on Amazon.,49768,3
49768,I don't like that it's tooooo long.,49768,3
49768,The belt don't fit around my waist at all.,49768,3
49768,I will never ever buy an outfit online again.,49768,3
49769,The fit was ok but it was too short and I am 1.50cm.,49769,3
49770,"love being able to wash on delicate and hang to dry, (it had a strong smell when first opened, it does look and feel like swede, fit is on the small side for a medium, it's fine as an fashion fringe addition.",49770,3
49771,"Pretty, very dainty necklace, hopefully it won't fall apart any time soon.",49771,3
49772,Not a bad shirt.,49772,3
49773,Bit smaller than I expected but for price a good little suit,49773,3
49774,this really is a beautiful piece of work but its so enormous an heavy its just unwearable- this coming from someone with a fetish for wide chunky watches I still just knew right out of the box this was going to be ridiculous.,49774,3
49774,Not many comparable items even the similar invicta skeleton watch is rated as being too gargantuan to wear :(.,49774,3
49774,"I really hope they can apply all that artistry to a more human sized version next, listed as 'unisex' hoping they plan to make an actual womens version!",49774,3
49775,"I am 5'2, size 14, 36C cup so I ordered the 3x in black and it fit me great!",49775,3
49775,Its not the best quality but its really cute and the price is a plus!,49775,3
49776,"Super cute shirt, not the best of quality.",49776,3
49776,The shirt itself is made for someone who is petite for sure!,49776,3
49776,"I ordered this (I'm 5'11"" and very skinny) and had to give this to my sister who is 5'3"" because it was short in every which way, and looked insanely awkward on me.",49776,3
49776,With that said the company was great about everything.,49776,3
49777,I didn't understand why there was no case - that was a bummer.,49777,3
49778,The color is beautiful as expected but the fit is not.,49778,3
49778,Ran too small and it is very light weight.,49778,3
49778,"This is a spring/ fall jacket not a winter coat, at least not for a Minnesota winter.",49778,3
49779,"Very cute, but small.",49779,3
49779,Won't get much wear out of them.,49779,3
49781,I love the ring.the plating wore off the first day I wore it but it didn't turn green so I'm still wearing it,49781,3
49783,"It is cute, just sized small.",49783,3
49784,Very cute and decent material but i recommend going up a size.,49784,3
49784,"Im petite about 105pounds 5'4 and i got a small, i could barely get it on im returning for a larger size.",49784,3
49785,CUTE BUT SUPER PETITE I BOUGHT A SMALL RETURNED FOR LARGE STILL SQUEEZED ME AROUND THE HIPS TO TIGHT.,49785,3
49785,IM A HEALTHY CURZY IN THE REAR AND TOP SIZE 7 AND LARGE IS STILL TO SMALL.,49785,3
49785,MUST BE ASIAN MODELS.,49785,3
49786,"Unfortunately, I didn't look through the reviews for this underwear before purchasing because I figured it would be difficult to mess up underwear.",49786,3
49786,"Well, I was wrong.",49786,3
49786,"If your little boy is expecting to see TRACTORS when his new undies arrive, don't buy these!",49786,3
49786,Looks like they've been misrepresentating these Mickey Mouse TRACTOR underwear since before 2014.,49786,3
49786,Doesn't seem like it'd be too difficult to resolve this issue and not have them listed as a purchasing option.,49786,3
49786,"I still received a Mickey Mouse pattern,  just not TRACTORS.",49786,3
49787,The print on the back is almost a sticker like quality.,49787,3
49787,Overpriced for the quality.,49787,3
49787,Now to be used for Halloween instead of wearing.,49787,3
49788,The stickiness of the product is good.,49788,3
49788,There are gaps on the sticky lining allowing your skin to breathe which is pretty nice.,49788,3
49788,Other sticky bras that I've had didn't have that.,49788,3
49788,The fit of this sticky bra isn't great though.,49788,3
49788,"It could just be me, but the bra didn't lay flush with my skin.",49788,3
49788,I think it's because of the special shape of the bra.,49788,3
49788,"Also, there are little pieces of fabric to put your nipples (nice that you don't have to pull anything off them), but I thought the positioning was a little weird.",49788,3
49788,It made it so I had to completely push my boobs together - not great.,49788,3
49788,"This bra does the job, but I wouldn't buy another.",49788,3
49788,I definitely prefer sticky bras that are oval shaped.,49788,3
49789,"The dress is pretty, but it is NOT for you if you have wide hips.",49789,3
49789,It's more of a slim fit dress.,49789,3
49789,I'll  either be altering this dress or giving it away because it doesn't fit.,49789,3
49790,"Pretty, but very stiff.",49790,3
49790,Doesn't drape on the wrist the way I would like.,49790,3
49790,However I have a petite wrist which might be part of the issue.,49790,3
49791,"Material wasn't what what expected, however the item fits cute",49791,3
49792,"Didn't like it ,quality wasn't what I expected.",49792,3
49792,I gave it to my niece.,49792,3
49793,I love this coat except for the fact that the left pocket's lining was never sewn together.,49793,3
49793,"The acetate fabric pieces for the pocket are there, but were never serged together!",49793,3
49794,The shirt itself is pretty but it runs a bit small.,49794,3
49794,I ordered a size up from my normal size and it fits a bit snug.,49794,3
49796,"I bought these pants to wear something not like regular casual ""khaki"" pants, but also similar to jeans but not blue.",49796,3
49796,I chose the charcoal color.,49796,3
49796,"The material seems sturdy, but as expected, the pockets are not deep and spacious.",49796,3
49796,Trying to get something out of the front pockets feels awkward.,49796,3
49796,"The so-called cellular phone pocket is large enough to stick a phone encased in an Otter Box, but I would prefer not to carry it in a leg pocket without a button or zipper.",49796,3
49796,It doesn't completely conceal the phone.,49796,3
49797,Was really pretty when I got it.....but the more you wear it the duller it gets.,49797,3
49797,"must be cleaned everyday to look ""sparkly""...I clean it with baby shampoo and a soft bristle baby toothbrush.....looks good right after cleaning...but that is about it...no stones have fallen out yet...but that is coming since my other rings I purchased at the same time have stones missing.",49797,3
49797,Again....you get what you pay for.,49797,3
49797,"...This was not a real bridal set for myself...I have a gold wide wedding band (heavyweight) it came from a jeweler  many, many years ago... but had to have it cut off...and I wear it now on my little pinkie finger...but I still wanted something sparkly for my ring finger.",49797,3
49797,..I won't be buying from this company anymore.,49797,3
49798,"I forget to check if the sizes are asian, this is.",49798,3
49798,"I look like a superhero in it, which will make it perfect for holloween, or if my other supersuit is in the cleaners.",49798,3
49798,Three stars because I feel awesome in it.,49798,3
49798,Only three stars because I look like I'm shopping in the kids section.,49798,3
49799,"Tight around the arm area, perfect everywhere else.",49799,3
49799,"It's not like I'm going to exercise in it, but still not perfect.",49799,3
49799,Pretty good for the price.,49799,3
49800,A little short waisted.,49800,3
49800,So if you have a high waist these will feel like they are falling off.,49800,3
49801,Absolutely adorable but much smaller than the tag,49801,3
49802,They made it look like you could put a cell phone in it and use it that way.,49802,3
49803,I got a XXL because of what was said in the reviews about them fitting a smaller build.,49803,3
49803,The fit is good but the arm length is a little shorter than I like.,49803,3
49803,Its also slightly snug.,49803,3
49803,I'm a 5'11/6'0  size 10 so you can take that in perspective.,49803,3
49805,It's ok I should have selected a medium,49805,3
49806,"Belt barely makes it around my waist line and my waist is 32""",49806,3
49807,I got the orange two piece.,49807,3
49807,"The bathing suit is really cute but it does not have the feel of a normal store bought bathing suit, It is a some-what thin nylon fabric so if your nipple protrude, you will diff.",49807,3
49807,Also the top is a piece of fabric so you do have to figure out how to tie it yourself to get the look in the picture.,49807,3
49807,All that aside this is definitely  going to be in my rotation of swimwear for the summer.,49807,3
49808,"It's two sizes larger than I ordered, but it works alright.",49808,3
49808,"If I'd paid more for it, I'd try to exchange.",49808,3
49809,"I'm 5'4, 135 lbs, 36D, wear size 6-8.",49809,3
49809,Ordered a large based on recommendations.,49809,3
49809,All areas fit but the waist is very boxy.,49809,3
49809,Average jacket for a good price.,49809,3
49810,I got the size XS as I am pretty skinny.,49810,3
49810,"The paints quality is good but too short for my height, 5'7"" (110lb).",49810,3
49811,Body suit doesn't stay put.,49811,3
49811,I feel as if it's going to slip off at any moment..,49811,3
49812,"Pretty cute but a little small, however with a compressor or a day of fasting you'll be fine",49812,3
49813,Not as impressed as I hoped.,49813,3
49813,"The part around the hips fit well an kept pants up, but the top around waist had to be readjusted frequently and seemed loose.",49813,3
49813,My hips are much larger than my waist so that was part of the issue.,49813,3
49813,"It was nice to be able to leave pants unbuttoned, but my pants quickly became too tight in other areas so even having the band I couldn't keep wearing them.",49813,3
49814,"It's not made of the jeans material I am used to, but its lightness is okay for the summer months.",49814,3
49815,"Nice coat, but runs small.",49815,3
49816,Sleeves were really tight in the forearm area.,49816,3
49816,The rest fits normal,49816,3
49817,Little smaller than expected,49817,3
49818,I'm 5'8 and the BFF Belly Bandit was short and not as strong.,49818,3
49818,It only covered part of my abdomen.,49818,3
49818,It kept bunching in the back shifting and loosening the Bandit.,49818,3
49818,I ended up using my Couture Tummy Tuck over the BFF Belly Bandit to keep it in place and for extra support.,49818,3
49818,I previously owned a Couture Tummy Tucker -XL.,49818,3
49818,"The fit and the strength was exceptional, I just needed a smaller size.",49818,3
49818,"I thought I would try the BFF Belly Bandit, I should have stuck with the Couture Tummy Tucker.",49818,3
49819,Does not stay buttoned closed.,49819,3
49820,"This is a cute monikini at a good price, I unfortunately have to return it because the front chest area is so low and widely cut that if I move my breasts fall out!",49820,3
49821,The shirt is beautifully made and very handsome but it was way too small for my husband.,49821,3
49821,"He typically wears an XL, but after reading the reviews I decided to go up a size to XXL and it was still way too small.",49821,3
49821,Not sure where they are getting their sizing from but it is WAY off!,49821,3
49822,"Flimsy making, but for the price it's ok.  Top is quite skimpy can't wear without a bathing suit or bra.",49822,3
49823,"i'm a bit disappointed as they fit like the ones I've bought directly from China, which was cheaper.",49823,3
49824,I loved the top unfortunately the bottoms were too tight I ordered a Medium and it was too small.,49824,3
49824,I will return and order the large although I believe the top might end up being too big.,49824,3
49825,The product is a bit snug.,49825,3
49825,I would recommend purchasing a size above what you normally wear.,49825,3
49825,I love the coloring.,49825,3
49826,But the chest area is a little exposed.,49826,3
49826,Also smaller than expected!,49826,3
49826,But everything would've been good if the chest area fit...,49826,3
49826,I'm a 34B and I couldn't find a bra that would work and I couldn't go without cause the fit would've exposed everything.,49826,3
49827,They are short and the belt is cruddy.,49827,3
49827,But for the price they work .,49827,3
49829,Blouse is chiffon in the front the back is a rough material not dressy from behind,49829,3
49830,"I really wanted the clear ones, which weren't included.",49830,3
49831,Ordered the large because the mediums were a little small in the back.,49831,3
49831,"Oddly enough, the large are the same size.",49831,3
49832,Cheap but cute I thought the bow on the back would be sewn in place and it's not :( but other than than that you get what you pay for.,49832,3
49833,My girlfriend ordered what she thought was the right size but unfortunately wasn't.,49833,3
49833,The seat of these pants is cut so you basically have to have a flat buttocks in order to fit into them.,49833,3
49834,microfiber with denim-look- my fleece microfiber of past pills horribly & what i'm trying to avoid buying any more of because it looks old & dumpy before too long so these i sent back.,49834,3
49834,"medium fit me good: my size is 29"" inseam, 40"" hip, 28"" waist.",49834,3
49835,Even the large was way too small.,49835,3
49835,Loved the coat just runs too small,49835,3
49836,after wearing this for a week straight i've come to love it!,49836,3
49836,Looks kinda fake in tights as there is a distinct dent in your lower butt crease that shows..but its bomb in jeans and dress!,49836,3
49836,It has gotten a bit slacker than when i first tried it on so i would not recommend for daily use...dont think it will last long that way.,49836,3
49836,Still love it tho for the price,49836,3
49838,"This dress was for a 14 year old and the pads for the bra area in the dress fit lower then it should for a teenager,
 had to get alteration done which  was costly, other than that it was a prefect fit.",49838,3
49840,Pretty dress for the price runs big on the top,49840,3
49841,I am disappointed in the sizing.,49841,3
49841,"I ordered a large, which I have never worn anything bigger than a large and sometimes wear a medium.",49841,3
49841,The material is clingy and doesn't fit like I want it to.,49841,3
49841,"However, I'm going to put a short vest with it and wear it because I do love the color.",49841,3
49842,It's cool but I would've liked it more if the arms were bigger mostly at the shoulders,49842,3
49843,Looks nice from a distance; looks flimsy up close.,49843,3
49845,Just the color I was looking for.,49845,3
49845,"Top is damaged, though.",49845,3
49845,Looks almost like it has been folded in the package and exposed to sunlight or bright light.,49845,3
49845,The folded portion across the chest left a faded line across it.,49845,3
49845,"I thought it was just from being folded since it was wrinkled with creases, so I washed it and it doesn't look any better.",49845,3
49846,This was returned it was nice but not what I had wanted.,49846,3
49847,"Really cute, very sexy bikini.",49847,3
49847,If you need support in the chest area this is not for you.,49847,3
49847,Unfortunately I was sent an XL instead of a L. Which I only decided upon because of other reviewers suggesting to order up a size.,49847,3
49847,I tried it on anyways and the XL bottoms are form fitting to say the least my bottom was more a Brazilian cut than a thong.,49847,3
49847,The top on the other hand was too big around my waist.,49847,3
49847,I'm about 138 lbs 5'7 and I don't dare eat anything heavy in this bikini because it will show every bulge.,49847,3
49847,But sexy to say the least!,49847,3
49848,Decent for the cheap price,49848,3
49849,Order at least one size bigger.,49849,3
49850,I didn't get all 110 pieces.,49850,3
49850,"I only got 93 pieces and they were only tongue bars, belly bars, eyebrow bars, and 2 lip labret retainers.",49850,3
49852,I really had high hopes for this dress but the patterns on each side of the dress don't match.,49852,3
49852,so when you button it up the like patterns don't merge.,49852,3
49852,Its more a mismatch.,49852,3
49852,Need a slip under this as well.,49852,3
49852,Seller wanted pictures and shipping back was more expensive than the dress so I'll be selling locally or wear it anyway.,49852,3
49853,Much larger then I thought,49853,3
49855,The shirt itself is a lovely cut and the size was true and it looked to be well made but it is completely see through.,49855,3
49855,"Like, I can read a book clear as day through it kind of see through which was much more than I expected.",49855,3
49855,If you don't mind the serious sheer then you will likely love the shirt especially if you are curvey or large busted as the cut is very flattering but for me I requested a refund.,49855,3
49855,Its just too sheer to wear to work which is what I bought it for.,49855,3
49856,Not sure its real.,49856,3
49857,It's super cute but the stars are sharp.,49857,3
49858,The cup size was right but the band size fit a little large.,49858,3
49858,"I prefer molded cup under-wire tops, and this isn't really a ""cup,"" more of a sling.",49858,3
49858,But the under-wire fits correctly and it's pretty modest.,49858,3
49859,"Water gets through to clothes, its waterproof-not water resistant.",49859,3
49859,Only for mild rain.,49859,3
49860,"Despite measurements listed, it's way too small.",49860,3
49860,"Asian sizing, go figure.",49860,3
49860,"Otherwise, it's beautiful, but not worth $40.",49860,3
49860,Just wish they would make it in US/AU sizes.,49860,3
49861,I loved the bracelet but the engraving was so light you could barely read it.,49861,3
49861,If they had used a black background it would have made all the difference.,49861,3
49861,In an emergency I want the EMT's to be able to see it fast and clearly.,49861,3
49862,Go a size up!!,49862,3
49863,"Its a little large, material isn't heavy, but of course I live in Texas....you don't want anything heavy in the summer.",49863,3
49863,Received lots of compliments on this dress.,49863,3
49864,It's a lot bigger than a normal drawstring bag.,49864,3
49864,"I ordered this for a 9 year old, and it looks funny when she carries it.",49864,3
49865,"Good quality, especially for white, but the torso is really short.",49865,3
49865,I bought a medium and the bottom fits perfect but the very top of the suit reaches just over my boobs so there is no way I can wear this.,49865,3
49865,Compared to another suit I bought the boob area in more in line with my midsection.,49865,3
49866,I received it today.,49866,3
49866,I thought the color would be the same as what is in the picture (gray).,49866,3
49866,It is more like dark dark gray.,49866,3
49866,It would be nice if they would put the actual color in the picture.,49866,3
49866,The pants look ok but the top is somewhat small.,49866,3
49867,It wasn't that big,49867,3
49869,Very thin material - not pants you can wear outside the house unless you want to showcase your assets.,49869,3
49870,The body portion of the shirt fit great but I do not have a very large chest and the chest part fit weirdly on me.,49870,3
49870,It was like an inch too big there- nothing I couldn't take in with my sewing machine.,49870,3
49871,This is s beautiful dress but shorter than shown on the picture.,49871,3
49871,It was above my knees,49871,3
49873,I love the shape of this dress.,49873,3
49873,"It's actually the 2nd I've purchased, but I'm not thrilled with the color pink.",49873,3
49873,It's not a deep pink like I had expected from the picture.,49873,3
49874,These shirts run really small.,49874,3
49875,"Shirt is as expected, but printing quality isn't top notch.",49875,3
49875,"For the price, however, is as expected.",49875,3
49876,"It's a beautiful ring, but you can tell it's cheaply made.",49876,3
49876,The rings were two different thickness and sizes.,49876,3
49876,Both were odd shaped as well.,49876,3
49878,sort of too small for my very thick hair.,49878,3
49878,Will be very cute on head with less volume hair.,49878,3
49879,"I am 5'4 and a size 14 and ordered an XL, and they are extremely tight around the waist.",49879,3
49879,They fit fine around the legs and are good length just extremely snug around the waist.,49879,3
49880,Material rough and unflattering.,49880,3
49881,"The item is very nice, but very small.",49881,3
49881,Order one- two sizes larger then your actual size.,49881,3
49882,"I got the largest size, but I am busty so it looks bad on me.",49882,3
49884,shorts are fine but the top is skinny on the front,49884,3
49885,"Though this is a beautiful shirt,the product description said the sizes ran small for this shirt, and recommended to order a size up.",49885,3
49885,"I did, and I received a shirt much too large, nearly to the point of being unwearable.",49885,3
49886,"Prettier in the picture, quality less than I expected in person.",49886,3
49886,Way cheaper than on the Venus site,49886,3
49888,"It's cute, but didn't ready fit me.",49888,3
49889,thin material and see through.,49889,3
49889,must wear a tank or something underneath or you will be able to see everything,49889,3
49891,The length was much short than I wanted,49891,3
49892,"The tank top is made of a very soft, delicate fabric.",49892,3
49892,"I like it, but it seems more appropriate for sleepwear than outerware, and I had hoped it to also be longer.",49892,3
49892,I'm on the fence about shipping it back only for that reason.,49892,3
49892,"As for the shipping, I know that delays happen and was very pleased to receive notification that there was a delay in the shipment.",49892,3
49892,I appreciated their follow up for customer service.,49892,3
49893,"Were smaller than I expected, definitely smaller than the listed Size",49893,3
49894,I received the product as expected.,49894,3
49894,"It fits perfectly on me, true to size.",49894,3
49894,The quality is a bit cheap but can't argue with it because of the price.,49894,3
49894,Though my only concern is the hook on bathing suit top.,49894,3
49894,It is not very secure.,49894,3
49894,"This bathing suit is only good for tanning but not for active swimming, etc.",49894,3
49895,Cute but a bit large,49895,3
49896,It great as an undergarment.,49896,3
49897,The top fits alright.,49897,3
49897,Wish it was a little longer.,49897,3
49897,The bottoms however are a mess.,49897,3
49897,"They are tiny which is fine, I knew they would have minimal coverage.",49897,3
49897,But the front doesn't lay right and in the back the one side is like a different shape than the other so I can't really wear it.,49897,3
49898,This two piece set is okay.,49898,3
49898,"It fits pretty good, but there isn't anything special about it.",49898,3
49900,I ordered a medium and 90% of the time I buy medium everything from shirts to pants and swimsuits and undies.,49900,3
49900,No free returns on mediums because you'll need to pay for return shipping and handling.,49900,3
49900,"Says full return, but I don't trust it.",49900,3
49900,Ended up cutting mine up for scraps and throwing it away.,49900,3
49900,"The shippers don't speak English and the return email I recieved took some time to decipher, but they seemed really nice and gave me 2 options.

I'm:
5'5""
140 +/- lbs.",49900,3
49900,"(Depending on the time of month)
34C (also depending on the time of month haha)

The fabric was lovely and true to the pictures.",49900,3
49900,Has a beautiful shimmer to it.,49900,3
49900,"It's pretty thin fabric, but in a nice way... like it would dry fast and you wouldn't be all moist for ages.",49900,3
49900,Straps are nice and thick and for those with chests we know is a plus.,49900,3
49900,The foam inserts are very small so you might want to switch them out for larger ones from one of your dresses or other swimtops to avoid that awkward circle outline on the chestal region.,49900,3
49900,My legs are fairly cushiony but the thigh holes seemed just fine.,49900,3
49900,Had a decent amount of give.,49900,3
49900,"I feel like a have a pretty filled out midsection, but the garment was too big around.",49900,3
49900,Length wise however it was way too short.,49900,3
49900,I don't have a particulary long torso so I do want to warn you.,49900,3
49900,You might need really large filled out perky boobs or really really large sagy boobs for this to work.,49900,3
49900,The shape is just different than I'm used to.,49900,3
49900,"Loved the suit overall, but sadly it just doesn't work with my body type.",49900,3
49900,I hate to pass up a shimmer suit with such a comfy neck strap.,49900,3
49901,"Too hot , 2 layers of fabric",49901,3
49902,The dress runs small we ordered it 2 full sizes bigger then she is and it just fits.,49902,3
49902,The zipper is not well made so we are not going to mess with it for fear of it braking before the wedding.,49902,3
49902,"The lace and look of the dress is beautiful, very soft and fits well if you order it bigger then your usual size.",49902,3
49902,shipped faster then they said it would.,49902,3
49902,Looks great with a jean jacket and cowboy boots to give it a cute country wedding look!,49902,3
49903,** I ORDERED A LARGE AND IT FITS LIKE A SMALL SO ORDER 2 SIZES UP IF POSSIBLE.,49903,3
49903,IF I LOSE 10 OBS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO WEAR IT.,49903,3
49903,IF IT FIT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL TOP ;0(,49903,3
49904,The material was super thin and does not lay as the picture suggest.,49904,3
49904,"But, it is cut identical as the picture.",49904,3
49904,Super thin like Halloween material.,49904,3
49904,You will need to wear a tank underneath.,49904,3
49904,"Also, a little snug so buy a size larger.",49904,3
49904,"Then, you will like it.",49904,3
49905,The bra size was alittle smaller than expected,49905,3
49906,SMALLER SIZE CHAIN THAN EXPECTED,49906,3
49907,"Bottom line guys, it's a little uncomfortable and doesn't hold much so makes sure your SO appreciates the show because you will want to take this off ASAP.",49907,3
49908,wished it had fit.,49908,3
49908,too short for my torso.,49908,3
49908,could barely get it up enough to cover top.,49908,3
49908,the crochet could have been stretchy it would have helped.,49908,3
49909,Would be better if adjustable.,49909,3
49910,"It would be very nice,if the size would be not to small.",49910,3
49910,Before I ordered the Camisole I read in the reviews that it runs small.,49910,3
49910,So I ordered one size bigger and it is still very small.,49910,3
49910,I ordered a XXL and the cup size is way to small.,49910,3
49910,I usually have a 40 D.,49910,3
49911,I have a smaller chest so i got the smallest size but its baggy up top cute though,49911,3
49913,Wish it fit better!,49913,3
49913,Wanted this for my sister!,49913,3
49914,Its a unique bow tie for sure but was very hard to keep on and also it kept rubbing on my husbands neck so he finally took it off - we had a party at work and there was a bow tie contest - unique for sure - practical not so much.,49914,3
49916,Fits so well everywhere except the front...slightly too restrictive on the pouch.,49916,3
49916,Excellent quality and material but sadly I can't enjoy it.,49916,3
49917,"I love the material,  but it is a little small across the shoulders.",49917,3
49918,"the waist is tight, I love these yoga pants and I first ordered a medium an it was tight so I ordered a large an they feel the same!",49918,3
49919,Looks great but sized very small the 3x was more like 1x,49919,3
49920,I usually order size or two bigger on all products from China.,49920,3
49920,Not with this one.,49920,3
49920,Very true to the size.,49920,3
49920,"I am 5.4 and 135 pounds, usually I am size Small, but I ordered large and it was gigantic.",49920,3
49920,"I don't like the fuss with returning products, so I took needle and tread and altered it myself in an hour.",49920,3
49920,"This product is actually good quality, but it is rough on the skin from outside.",49920,3
49920,"Also, this product is great for the girls with the big boobs ;)",49920,3
49921,I love Henley neck shirts.,49921,3
49921,"I also love sleeveless, so I thought I had a winner here.",49921,3
49921,Well... not so fast.,49921,3
49921,The cloth is not a bad thickness for a T-shirt.,49921,3
49921,"Not the usual thin crap you get, but also not the real comfortable thick.",49921,3
49921,"The ribbing on the gray ""T"" I received made the cloth feel a little thicker.",49921,3
49921,"The cotton was soft and not scratchy which is another plus, upon receiving it, of course I had to wash it.",49921,3
49921,I was hoping it would shrink a little.,49921,3
49921,"Looking at the reviews and sizing chart, I knew already to order at least a size or 2 larger than my US size.",49921,3
49921,I wear a large shirt (US).,49921,3
49921,"So although the scale said US XL/Asia XXL (JPSK15), it actually fit like a large (US).",49921,3
49921,"I suppose if you like REALLY tight shirts you can go one size large, but for a really good, form fitting, yet not super tight I would go 2 sizes up.",49921,3
49921,NOW my main complaint.,49921,3
49921,"There is something totally not right with the cut of the neck, making it not only feel weird, but look a little strange.",49921,3
49921,"A traditional Henley has a smaller neck, similar to a traditional ""T"" shirt.",49921,3
49921,"I was going to wear this under an open button up shirt, but I think this may just become a gym shirt as I really do not like the way the neck looks on me.",49921,3
49921,"minus 1/2 star for sizing chart being off, and minus 1 star for the neck being wacked.",49921,3
49921,Total 3.5 star rating.,49921,3
49922,"This looks beautiful, however very delicate.",49922,3
49922,But worth the price for what it is,49922,3
49923,I ordered a small.,49923,3
49923,Bottoms are very small.,49923,3
49923,I am a 0/2 and still very tight on me.,49923,3
49923,I'm a 32DDD and the top fits...,49923,3
49923,But it's wrinkled probably because of the cheap fabric.,49923,3
49923,The straps don't offer any support.,49923,3
49923,I had to cut the top strap of the bottoms off because it was too tight.,49923,3
49923,But other than that it still looks cute on,49923,3
49924,"when i first opened the package, my first impression was ""they are really thin!""",49924,3
49924,but i tried them on and it works on slacks.,49924,3
49924,im a size and i have to use the very first hole to tie around my hips.,49924,3
49924,but it looks ok. im keeping them because i get a lot of colors for a good price.,49924,3
49924,its a good way to add detail top an outfit.,49924,3
49925,The product looks nice but it runs very small.,49925,3
49925,My daughter just tuned 3 and she is very skinny and the 3-4 years was small for her.,49925,3
49926,The outfit was boxy and did not fit me like shown on the model.,49926,3
49926,"Cute concept, I just didn't like it on me.",49926,3
49927,"I ordered a medium which is usually my size,but it way toooo small for me.",49927,3
49927,I gave it three stars because it fits my daughter.,49927,3
49927,I will be ordering different colors for my daughter.,49927,3
49928,"It's a dress made of cheap fabric, and the seams are uneven.",49928,3
49928,I think it's overpriced for what it is.,49928,3
49929,Size is my only issue.,49929,3
49929,I wear a medium hat.,49929,3
49929,Every hat I order in medium fits good.,49929,3
49929,This one is just a bit too big.,49929,3
49929,I'm having to order a hat size reducer.,49929,3
49929,"Other than that, it's a great hat!",49929,3
49930,"Great fit, but my problem is the buttons aren't sewn on properly and mines came missing one of the blue buttons from it and loose threads on some others.",49930,3
49930,But the shirt itself is a great shirt design and overall quality is decent.,49930,3
49931,Blue pair had snags in them.,49931,3
49932,I like the style but ran waaaay to small.,49932,3
49932,Had to order 2 sizes larger.,49932,3
49933,"I'm not very busty, but I have a big butt and this suit just didn't work for my top and bottom.",49933,3
49933,You can't order a small/medium top and large bottom and that's what I needed.,49933,3
49933,"However, the bottoms fit really well and are super flattering.",49933,3
49933,"For a much MUCH bustier person, the top would also look really nice.",49933,3
49935,"Very, very fine...only purchase if you like an invisible chain look.",49935,3
49936,this was my bad.,49936,3
49936,I ordered this for a costume and it was the wrong shade of gold and didn't really add to the costume like I thought it would so it's just sitting in my drawer as I didn't have the heart to return it for my mistake :(,49936,3
49938,Looks better than it works.,49938,3
49939,Had to send them back... they were really big with huge pockets,49939,3
49940,Beautiful dress didn't get to wear because it was way to small.,49940,3
49940,I ordered a size bigger and I need another 2 sizes bigger lol.,49940,3
49941,Well made but not all of it fit.,49941,3
49942,"okay, but not as authentic looking as I antipicated",49942,3
49943,They are bit heavy.,49943,3
49943,Look real cool though,49943,3
49944,Faded quickly after a couple of washes,49944,3
49945,The sizing is fairly accurate.,49945,3
49945,The ring is small and lightweight.,49945,3
49945,However it does not match the picture.,49945,3
49945,The gen in my ring was NOT aquamarine but rather a plain clear diamond.,49945,3
49945,I am disappointed it was not aquamarine.,49945,3
49946,"Very tiny, shipping was slow, but overall a good deal.",49946,3
49946,Just buy a size or two larger than you normally would.,49946,3
49947,I agree with the other review on here that this dress has some major differences from the photos shown.,49947,3
49947,I hate that the slit is on the side and not in the front... And The print is SO much bigger in the dress I received than the one in the picture- and it looks really cheap to me.,49947,3
49947,I never would've picked this dress out at any store.,49947,3
49947,"I must admit that the dress fits nicely (I am 5'5, size 4 dress, 34D bust) so if you don't mind the print and side slit difference- I guess I would recommend this to you.",49947,3
49947,I just hate when sellers are deceptive of their products with false photos!,49947,3
49947,"(First three photos shown are showing extra long length of dress on 5'5 with no shoes, last photo I'm wearing 4.5 inch wedges and with the shoes it doesn't drag on floor)",49947,3
49948,seems come apart easily,49948,3
49949,Cute and inexpensive purse I bought to kick around the last weeks of summer.,49949,3
49949,Please note:  THE TOP ZIPPER DOES NOT SPAN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE PURSE - THE PURSE DOES NOT ZIP COMPLETELY CLOSED!,49949,3
49949,You can't see this in any of the pictures.,49949,3
49949,"Essentially, your items can fall out when leaning over, etc.",49949,3
49949,"-- the zipper leaves about 2-3"" of open space on either side.",49949,3
49949,"Also, the cell pocket is too small to fit modern cell phone (I keep lotion, lip gloss in mine), and the interior zip pocket is tiny as well.",49949,3
49949,It's cute but not well made.,49949,3
49949,Shipping also took quite a bit of time though within the acceptable Amazon time span.,49949,3
49949,"I wanted ""cute and bright"" and that's about all this bag is.",49949,3
49950,I've never worn it out.,49950,3
49950,I can't stand the way the fabric feels.,49950,3
49951,I don't care for the material and gets dirty easy,49951,3
49952,Very cute but way too small.,49952,3
49952,"I ordered a 7, fits more like a 1 or 3",49952,3
49953,Would give a 4/5 if two out of the six pairs didn't have a hole at the foot and if it wasn't so snug at the very top.,49953,3
49953,There's no elastic so it kinda suffocates your leg so you have to roll it down a bit.,49953,3
49954,Everything fit but the cup size.,49954,3
49954,I would not recommend this suit if you are average or small chested.,49954,3
49954,Otherwise it is very cute!,49954,3
49955,The top is a bit small and the skirt a bit lose.,49955,3
49955,I am a size 10 and I ordered a medium.,49955,3
49955,"The thing is that I feel like after a couple washes it starts to stretch and it isn't the same, but the color is very nice and its very comfortable.",49955,3
49955,I could buy it again.,49955,3
49956,"I bought 3 pieces, one arrived with a gem stone missing on the left wing",49956,3
49957,"This jacket is off suberb quality, the make is a bit iffy or maybe it's because it fits me a bit small, I'm not sure but I don't regret this purchase despite the issues with the fit.",49957,3
49958,"Ok, first of all this shirt looks amazing.",49958,3
49958,The color and detail of the graphics are spot on.,49958,3
49958,"However, I ordered this for my husband who typically wears a 2XL in most shirts, and sometimes even a XL at that.",49958,3
49958,I ordered a 2XL which is the biggest size they offered and it literally looked like a bra on him.,49958,3
49958,"There is no stretch at all to the material, which wouldn't be a problem if it fit as expected at least.",49958,3
49958,"I generally wear a medium or large in women's and a small in men's and this fit me comfortably, just a little big but not crazy big (in a 2XL).",49958,3
49958,"SO if you do order this shirt, because yes it's dope af, then order at least two sizes larger than you normally would, and if you wear a XL or bigger in most shirts I sadly wouldn't recommend this shirt for you.",49958,3
49958,It did ship from China so patience is a virtue.,49958,3
49958,It took about 3 weeks for it to arrive.,49958,3
49960,"I wore the necklace because it worked well with my dress, and the stone part of it in the front is nice, but the gold part on the chain is badly tarnished.",49960,3
49960,"It is extremely light weight, but that is to be expected with the low price.",49960,3
49961,I ordered the XXL b/c I wanted the loose fit as shown and I knew it was Asian sizing.,49961,3
49962,Pants were too small.,49962,3
49962,My fault not the maker of the pants.,49962,3
49963,"Not as pictured, material a bit thin and best to order up a size or two.",49963,3
49964,"I like the gloves but they are too small and not as long as I had measured, but I'm still going to wear them.",49964,3
49965,still medium size for men; not the smaller for women size; and this silver is more of grey/gray.,49965,3
49966,The birthstone is so small you can barley see it.,49966,3
49966,It looks bigger in the picture.,49966,3
49967,I m 22 weeks.,49967,3
49967,It's a beautiful dress and it's hard to find beautiful maternity for high end work environment but I it's small and there is absolutely no room for growing belly .,49967,3
49967,Unfortunately I ll wear it maybe 2 3 more weeks than its too tight .,49967,3
49968,I'm a big fan of PattyBoutik.,49968,3
49968,"I do love the length and stretch of this jacket, however, as others have commented, the zippers on the sleeves are just awkward.",49968,3
49968,"Don't get me wrong, I still wear it, but I do not like that feature.",49968,3
49968,"I've actually hurt myself with them :)  they are right under your wrists, and big and bulky.",49968,3
49968,"And, if you plan on wearing inside, as I do, working at a computer/typing with big zippers on your wrists is not fun.",49968,3
49970,Very stretchy and comfy.,49970,3
49970,Wear a Cami tank with the white.,49970,3
49970,"But for the price, it's pretty awesome!",49970,3
49971,"Cute top, and I love the cat detail.",49971,3
49971,"It definitely runs small, though.",49971,3
49971,"I'm typically a 1X-2X so I ordered the extra-large, and I would prefer it to fit looser than it does.",49971,3
49971,"The fabric is also a bit thin, and I'm worried the cat detailing will rub off after a few washes but time will tell.",49971,3
49972,Could be used as pajamas,49972,3
49973,"Big rim, sturdy, looks a big fancier than just a beach ir gardening hat.",49973,3
49974,"Not at all stiff, very floppy.",49974,3
49974,An EXPLOSION of glitter occurred upon opening the bag.,49974,3
49975,A lot heavier material and is warm.,49975,3
49975,Wished it were lighter weight.,49975,3
49976,The brim of the hat doesn't really keep its shape.,49976,3
49976,That's a little disappointing.,49976,3
49976,"It's a little big now, but there's room to grow and I'm hoping it will take shape as it fits better.",49976,3
49977,"Where a large for everything else and expected the shorts to be somewhat baggy but elastic without any stretch was too big for my waist, where a 32 so thought they would be fine.",49977,3
49977,Should have gotten a medium.,49977,3
49978,I am not really a fan of the hardware on the sleeves though,49978,3
49979,I'm okay but still big for my kid.,49979,3
49980,Only 3 stars -you need to order one size larger than you need.,49980,3
49980,Fabric was of good quality but when unplaced order it said product was $8.77 when I received my bill I was charged $19.99.,49980,3
49980,I kept jammies because they were a birthday gift for my grandson who was leaving for Disney the next day.,49980,3
49980,Would have to think about ordering from them again .,49980,3
49981,good cover up for the price,49981,3
49982,tried to return - only gave me 2.89 back - very disappointed with the experience,49982,3
49983,This was way too small for my wife.,49983,3
49983,It looks good on my nine year old.,49983,3
49984,the sleeves were to short so i wear it as quarter sleeve and it wasn't long on the back like it was suppose to be it barley covers my butt other that that its fine i guess.,49984,3
49984,im 5'4/5'5 and weigh around 150-160 and got a large.only problem is that sleeves were to short and it wasn't as long as I expected other than that it fit fine,49984,3
49985,Glasses are ok but the case is not very efficient protecting iPhone screen.,49985,3
49986,The material is really thin.,49986,3
49986,I'm not impressed with the quality.,49986,3
49987,"If it wasn't such a hassle, I would have returned it.",49987,3
49987,There is a sewing error directly on the front of the blouse which I will cover with a brooch or something.,49987,3
49987,"Otherwise, fits as expected, and what the heck, for under $6, what did I expect?",49987,3
49988,Your standard cheap necklace.,49988,3
49988,They used to cost $.25 out of a gumball machine a few years ago.,49988,3
49988,"I couldn't believe what I was paying for it now, and it broke after a while, but I expected it to, it's a cheap plastic necklace.",49988,3
49989,"I bought this for my vacation, it packs wrinkles!",49989,3
49989,Be prepared to iron it.,49989,3
49989,I did not wear it because it a bit tight.,49989,3
49989,"I normally wear x-lrg, but it fit like a large.",49989,3
49989,"I will not sent it back, I'm going to gift it to a friend instead.",49989,3
49990,the product was fine,49990,3
49991,"Very pretty dress, but it's just way too small on top for me.",49991,3
49991,"I usually wear a med, but ordered a large.",49991,3
49991,"I'm 5'7, 155lbs and size D. I couldn't zip it past my boobs.",49991,3
49991,"If you are smaller chested, this dress will work for you!",49991,3
49991,The slit in the front wasn't too short either.,49991,3
49991,Wish it fit because it's really pretty!,49991,3
49993,The sizing is odd on this; I normally wear a 12/14 and the XXL was really small in the bust/abdomen and too big in the bottoms.,49993,3
49993,The bust runs very small and is not supportive.,49993,3
49993,"The abdomen area also runs very small, the suit fits tight like a normal swimsuit, nothing like the loose fit shown in the picture.",49993,3
49994,"Has a definite fitted shape to it, does not drape.",49994,3
49994,I take a large in shoulders and medium elsewhere.,49994,3
49994,"Due to that fact, the larger fitted bustline and waistline did not look very good.",49994,3
49994,"If you are a true large all over, I'm sure this would work though.",49994,3
49994,"In other words, it is not a one size fits all, for sure, but then it is not advertised as such.",49994,3
49995,Cute shirt but runs extremely small and is made of a very thin material.,49995,3
49995,My daughter loves it though.,49995,3
49995,I would have returned it completely if my daughter didn't like it so much - I had to do an exchange.,49995,3
49996,Keeps my head warm.,49996,3
49997,Purchased for someone else,49997,3
49998,Plastic no labels ok but smell stunk up my whole house.,49998,3
50000,I love the fabric and design of this tank top.,50000,3
50000,"I am a frequent cruiser and have a skirt this would work perfect with for a casual, but dressy, evening.",50000,3
50000,"Unfortunately, I will return because it is just cut too small for me.",50000,3
50000,I wear women's size clothing and ordered the largest size.,50000,3
50000,I compare this product to Junior Size ladies wear.,50000,3
50001,Looks cheap but then again it is,50001,3
50002,"I'm 5'10"", hourglass shape, and size 12-14 virtually always works for me.",50002,3
50002,"Reviews said they ran small so I ordered XL, which was supposed to be equivalent to a 16-18.",50002,3
50002,"Sadly they were still too tight around my upper thighs, hips and backside and I couldn't fasten the button at the waist.",50002,3
50002,"If you are tall (the length was great) and narrow, one to two sizes up should do you good, but if you have wide hips or thick thighs these will probably not work at all for you.",50002,3
50002,"Otherwise they seem very well made with thick, hefty fabric and reinforced functional pockets, sturdy drawstrings around the ankles, etc.",50002,3
50002,I'll see if my sister can wear them but if not they will be returned.,50002,3
50003,Its an okay product.,50003,3
50003,"Hat is oddly tall and the cubs sign is an iron on, so when I received it, there was a crease down the middle from it being in a package.",50003,3
50004,I have purchased several capris from this company and all have been great except this pair.,50004,3
50004,The waistband has loosened up to the point where I am constantly pulling them up.,50004,3
50004,The heather color is a nice change to plain brown.,50004,3
50005,Pretty shirt but fits like a medium not an Xl,50005,3
50006,The phone case was very cute and very convenient because it is also a wallet.,50006,3
50006,"Unfortunately, because of the material I was only able to keep it for 2 months before it started to fall apart.",50006,3
50006,"I don't carry a purse, and this was my alternative, so it got a lot of wear and tear.",50006,3
50006,"I think if I had a purse it would be better protected, and probably would have lasted longer.",50006,3
50007,Just doesn't fit my holes.,50007,3
50009,Was not what I expected,50009,3
50010,Fabric is much different from the picture.,50010,3
50010,Heavier Cotton but Great for the Price.,50010,3
50011,Love this if it would fit my very average size wrist.,50011,3
50011,It won't go over my hand.,50011,3
50011,Would have been 5 stars if it worked.,50011,3
50012,"Quality is good, but not great.",50012,3
50012,It serves the purpose when doing your workouts.,50012,3
50013,"Top is too small, fits like a medium instead of xl.",50013,3
50014,"Maybe I just missed it in the description, but I was hoping these had a more solid sole (more like an actual shoe), not just little rubbery dots on the bottom.",50014,3
50014,"They are, however, very soft and cozy.",50014,3
50014,Just don't get them if you're looking for something with a hard sole and support.,50014,3
50015,"For the price, the earrings are okay.",50015,3
50015,"The posts came bent, but I was able t bend them back into place.",50015,3
50015,The skeletal hands are much larger than I thought they would be.,50015,3
50016,It took the time that was listed (a couple weeks from overseas) to get here.,50016,3
50016,"And it is pretty true to the price...very sheer, flimsy material.",50016,3
50016,"It won't last a long time, but we only need it for this year's ensemble so it should do the trick and the price was right.",50016,3
50017,The fit is a little weird.,50017,3
50017,The bottom is very baggy (a leotard should bit tightly),50017,3
50018,I ordered based on the size chart.,50018,3
50018,"But, it was definitely too big.",50018,3
50018,There was no support up top at all.,50018,3
50018,"For reference I am 5'3"" and 125lbs, bust size 32DD.",50018,3
50018,I ordered a large but should have ordered a medium or maybe even a small.,50018,3
50019,I love the bracelet but the clasp is loose and constantly comes undone.,50019,3
50020,High chance of having a wardrobe malfunction :(,50020,3
50021,"Not crazy about fit, would of liked it longer,and more fitted.",50021,3
50022,"Hey, its not the 1st century Roman army issue to be sure.",50022,3
50022,Will look nice in a church Easter play.,50022,3
50022,Price is very good,50022,3
50023,"Cute suit for the price but fits a little snug, I an 5'4'' 120lb (usually a size 4 or S) and ordered a M, found it to be a little tight on my butt.",50023,3
50024,The fit is more narrow in the torso than expected.,50024,3
50024,I ordered a men medium.,50024,3
50024,"It's just not a comfortable t-shirt, which is unfortunate because it's pretty cool looking.",50024,3
50025,I got these for my daughter who has snake bits and does cheer.,50025,3
50025,So she has to wear clear ones for cheer.,50025,3
50025,"From her opinion, they are okay.",50025,3
50025,"She like that they press together, no O ring.",50025,3
50025,But it is really thin plastic at the connection point so they are breaking in her sleep.,50025,3
50025,I think she also needed a shorter length cuz they stick out kind of far.,50025,3
50025,"She wished they were more clear then opaque, it looks weird having a dense plastic on her face.",50025,3
50025,lol  She want to try a shorter length and see if they work better.,50025,3
50025,In a week she is down to 3 left cuz the others broke in her sleep.,50025,3
50026,its a little bit too big but I have a tiny neck,50026,3
50027,"It was beautiful, but too tight on my wrist.",50027,3
50028,Much smaller than expected.,50028,3
50028,I ordered a large just incase of this but it's still too small!,50028,3
50029,"The shorts are great, and got lots of laughs under my husband's hospital gown.",50029,3
50029,"Like others have said, though, it's not too sturdy, and ripped on the the bottom seam when we put it on (although I have to add the caveat that he put them on over sweats...wouldn't recommend that!)",50029,3
50030,a little tight around the stomach but very cute!!,50030,3
50031,The top of this tunic is really nice and fits good but the body of it is a lot of material.,50031,3
50031,Might talk myself into wearing it with leggings or such as it is quite lengthy too and I'm a tall person.,50031,3
50032,"Very clingy, thin and revealing.",50032,3
50033,The O-H-I-O people bib is cute.,50033,3
50033,OSU fans would like it.,50033,3
50033,"But, the O-H-I-O people are not centered nor straight across the bib.",50033,3
50033,Too bad it is poor quality.,50033,3
50035,Everything fit great except the waist.,50035,3
50035,I even purchased one size larger.,50035,3
50035,A little disappointed in the sizing.,50035,3
50036,"To consider the number of stars I would give this, I had to take into consideration the various components of this costume.",50036,3
50036,"I am 5'6"" and 135 pounds and ordered the small costume, and it fits nicely.",50036,3
50036,"Here is my review:

The bodice/skirt: the main piece of the costume consists of the bodice (top) and skirt, which are connected.",50036,3
50036,"Overall, this part of the costume is pretty decently constructed, and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.",50036,3
50036,"The bodice is a velvety material and has some stretch and structure to it, but I noticed other reviews mention a zipper.",50036,3
50036,"Mine did not have a zipper, so I had to pull it over my head and hope not to stretch it too much.",50036,3
50036,"It fits pretty snugly, but does not provide chest support, so it would most likely have to be worn with a strapless bra or bustier for a little more structure.",50036,3
50036,I am a 34D and the small provided enough coverage.,50036,3
50036,"The skirt is cute, a shiny blue material with gold stars, not much else to say about that.",50036,3
50036,The knee-high boot covers: terrible and unusable!,50036,3
50036,"The tops are not tight enough and sag, and the bottoms hang loosely and won't completely cover boots.",50036,3
50036,"I won't wear them with this costume, and I might try to find an alternative.",50036,3
50036,"The belt: fits nicely around my waist/hips, although just barely.",50036,3
50036,"I could see if someone was more curvy, the belt might not fit.",50036,3
50036,The belt would be better with a little stretch to it or some elastic in the back.,50036,3
50036,"Arm cuffs: while the rest of the costume has gold accessories, the cuffs are silver.",50036,3
50036,They are very basic and loose on my forearms.,50036,3
50036,"I will wear them, just so I have something on my wrists, but I might spray paint them gold.",50036,3
50036,Head piece: will work just fine!,50036,3
50036,It is as pictured and wraps around the head and fastens with Velcro.,50036,3
50036,Cape: lightweight and fastens around the neck.,50036,3
50036,"The Velcro fasteners are a little scratchy on my neck, but it's a costume, so I expect a little Velcro here and there.",50036,3
50036,"Thankfully, the cape helps to hide some of the imperfections of the bodice.",50036,3
50036,I should mention that I had to exchange my costume for another in the same size because the bodice of the costume had some weird bulging on the sides that made it look like I have rolls under my arms and on my sides.,50036,3
50036,"I haven't received the replacement, so I hope it will be sewn a little more carefully.",50036,3
50037,Cute style but the drawstring for the waist came out.,50037,3
50037,I haven't sun tested it yet.,50037,3
50037,I fit a size 4 to 6 and the jacket was a little large on me.,50037,3
50037,I think it is more like a size 8-10.,50037,3
50038,Washed before I wore it and the black faded immediately.,50038,3
50038,I washed it on cold and inside out.,50038,3
50039,they are nice but very unconfortable for me to wear.,50039,3
50040,I have had this purse since the beginning of March and the zipper has already broken off.,50040,3
50040,"I LOVED this purse, super cute, really big, but so cheaply made...",50040,3
50040,I wouldn't buy this again.,50040,3
50041,"i ended up selling the item bottom was small, top was fine.",50041,3
50041,good quality but unforunately didn't fit,50041,3
50042,Shirt wrinkles easily even if taken out of the dryer immediately.,50042,3
50042,"Serviceable, but I think I will stick with some of the other shirts I have as my defaults.",50042,3
50043,The back is very pretty but does nothing for support.,50043,3
50043,it feels like a thin pad it place across my chest.,50043,3
50043,it feels awkward and big.,50043,3
50045,This top does not look as it does in the picture.,50045,3
50045,"The top was short and boxy, I had to give to my friend who is much smaller than me - and I even ordered a size up.",50045,3
50046,This is a nice piece but I must say it looks like granny panties.,50046,3
50046,Not my favorite piece but it will work.,50046,3
50047,I like the shoe but too small.,50047,3
50047,My son wears a 6 so I got him a 6 1/2 and it was very snug,50047,3
50048,Fit too small across the chest and sleeves,50048,3
50050,It was way too big for me but it is a well made item.,50050,3
50051,"Got these for my friends and myself for a trip to the bahamas, everyone thought they were very cute, but most of them were broken by the time we flew home",50051,3
50052,"I usually wear an XS or S and I got a medium because I was worried it would fit skin tight being a juniors shirt, but I should have gone with the small because it fits true to size and the medium was too loose for me.",50052,3
50052,However it is 100% cotton so it shrunk when I dried  it and now it fits closer to a small and much better.,50052,3
50052,"It is a little thin and see through, but other than that I love it.",50052,3
50053,large was too large,50053,3
50054,"Top okay, bottoms way too small.",50054,3
50055,I'm 5'4 and 135lbs (i ordered a medium) and it was large in my arms and tight on my chest... will have it altered to see if it looks better.,50055,3
50056,"It is polyester and is not as long as picture but I've ended up really liking it , it is light weight and cozy",50056,3
50058,NOt grazy about it--tight in all the wrong area and very sheer.,50058,3
50058,LIKE THE IDEA BUT WHY CAN WE GET A DECENT BLOUSE THAT DOESN'T TURN INTI A SAUNA JUST BECAUSE SO MANY OF US PREFER DARDER CLOSER,50058,3
50059,This dress is still hanging in my closet.,50059,3
50059,"It is too tight on top and probably would be too hot, since it is made of jersey.",50059,3
50059,It looks so pretty on the model and perhaps someone else would think this was a great purchase.,50059,3
50059,I am going to find a new owner who will appreciate it.,50059,3
50060,If you are looking for something with support this is not for you.,50060,3
50060,"The straps cannot be adjusted, I'm going to have to cut them and shorten them.",50060,3
50060,This is NOT a one piece bathing suit.,50060,3
50060,There is not a bottom in the suit!,50060,3
50060,"The so called body shaping is a very thin piece of material such as what you would make a wedding veil out of, it's not even stretchy.",50060,3
50060,I'm going to keep it because I like the style but I will have to make alterations.,50060,3
50060,"Plus I will defiantly have to get something to put under it, maybe some biking shorts.",50060,3
50060,"Very disappointing, Plus the feeling of being deceived.",50060,3
50060,I only checked fits as expected because  there was not a NOT SATISFIED button..,50060,3
50061,Loved it until the first wash.  Now the top is about 2 sizes smaller :(  The bottoms are still somewhat ok although still smaller than before,50061,3
50062,Color was not exactly the same as pictured.,50062,3
50063,It took way longer to get these than it said when I purchased them.,50063,3
50063,"The picture is a little blury, but I still like them ok and wear them every once in a while.",50063,3
50065,"Fit was good ,but the material was thin",50065,3
50066,"Ok I've ordered from tough cookie's several times, but this time  a 3 pack but only received 1 shirt.",50066,3
50066,I love tough cookies produce but disappointed about this order $29 for one shirt?,50066,3
50066,Would be nice if someone could get a hold of me.,50066,3
50067,I like the length but runs a bit tighter than expected.,50067,3
50067,I like that is very breathable.,50067,3
50073,"A very nice swim suit, however, it could use a little more stretch in the fabric.",50073,3
50073,I wear medium normally but bought a large in case and it fits.,50073,3
50074,Fit was somewhat smaller than I expected.,50074,3
50075,nice material ...  would order again,50075,3
50076,"Really cute, but one of the balls fell out.",50076,3
50076,:(  I can't find it anywhere.,50076,3
50076,"Would have wore them all the time, as I love the little bit of sparkle they add.",50076,3
50077,"The necklace was very pretty, but I ordered it for a small child and the beads would have been very disproportionate to her size.",50077,3
50077,"The 7 largest beads were 1"" in diameter and the 14 smaller beads were 3/4"" in diameter.",50077,3
50078,I gave this a low rating bc it is already coming apart.,50078,3
50078,The outside pocket doesn't seem like it would securely hold your I'd.,50078,3
50078,The cc holder on the inside barely fits in the zippered pouch.,50078,3
50078,This is where mine is falling apart after opening 2 times,50078,3
50079,Loved this except the chain broke immediately while trying to put it on,50079,3
50080,"If you have even the tiniest ""belly"" this will show it.",50080,3
50080,I loved it and I wishi could have kept it.,50080,3
50080,But it looked like I was in the early stages of pregnancy.,50080,3
50080,"I'm 5'7"" and 130 lbs, fairly skinny if I do say so myself.",50080,3
50081,They didn't look or fit as expected but they are okay.,50081,3
50082,Pretty but......the reviews said this runs small & to order two sizes bigger.,50082,3
50082,I'm a 18-20 2x I order 4x & there is no way in a million years that size is accurate my niece who wears a medium to large off any rack fits this perfectly,50082,3
50083,This is way too big.,50083,3
50083,Love the design but due to sizing will not reach for it as often as I had hoped.,50083,3
50083,"Due to the size it is much lower cut on me than pictured, so will need to wear a camisole or mock turtle neck with it.",50083,3
50083,"Great length for leggings but the sleeves, trunk and decollete are sized too large.",50083,3
50084,The picture must have mislead me.,50084,3
50084,They show the face as much smaller than it is in reality.,50084,3
50084,Some else mentioned a similar comment.,50084,3
50084,I am glad I ordered the largest size.,50084,3
50084,"It's fine, but I wouldn't order it again.",50084,3
50084,"Or if you have a small head, it may be perfect for you :)",50084,3
50085,They smear very easily and were big.,50085,3
50085,More for a man than a woman,50085,3
50087,I would recommend this to beginners,50087,3
50088,though it would fit better,50088,3
50089,Leather smells even after sitting out for months.,50089,3
50090,"I like it but it is thin, so I usually wear something under it.",50090,3
50091,"I wish it wasn't an iron on though,",50091,3
50092,I like the shoes but they run small lengthwise but because of the style it would be to big if I sized up.,50092,3
50092,Very cute shoe on my feet overall.,50092,3
50092,I will keep and strut in these shoes.,50092,3
50093,The too is cute and comfortable but a little big.,50093,3
50093,I wear a size 6 so I ordered a Small but I could have ordered an X-Small.,50093,3
50093,"The material is not T-shirt or sweater material, it's different but comfy",50093,3
50094,Did fit a bit small.,50094,3
50095,It was pretty but to small,50095,3
50097,You can see through these leggings.,50097,3
50097,I did like how high they went but retuned them because I don't want see through leggings...,50097,3
50098,I should have sprung for a more expensive fez.,50098,3
50098,The fez is a very lightweight felt and gets much wider towards the opening for the head.,50098,3
50098,Doesn't fit on children and is lose on adults.,50098,3
50098,It worked well for his Halloween costume on being the Doctor from Doctor who.,50098,3
50098,Hasn't warn it since.,50098,3
50099,"Very pretty, bought it for a photo shoot.",50099,3
50099,I bought it 2 sizes up but the corset is still small.,50099,3
50099,Not made for busty women.,50099,3
50100,THE BIKINI ARRIVED WITH DEFECTS.,50100,3
50100,IT HAD BIG WRINKLES ON THE FABRIC THAT WOULD NOT GO AWAY BECAUSE OF THE MATERIAL.,50100,3
50101,"Oh dear, where to start...",50101,3
50101,"Fits fine, washes well, comfortable.",50101,3
50101,Color changes slightly (I bought the blue-green) but not as in the photos.,50101,3
50101,"Worse, I can never tell if heat is making it brighter or darker.",50101,3
50101,What happens is that it turns a brighter blue on me but then parts cool down (or heat up?),50101,3
50101,"and turn darker, which looks exactly like I have dirt across the shirt.",50101,3
50101,My wife seriously thought I had dirt across my chest!,50101,3
50102,My dress didn't fit over this and the rings seemed flimsy.,50102,3
50103,Nice sweater but runs extremely small!!,50103,3
50104,Pants was too big but shirt was ok,50104,3
50105,There's no way to put this delicately.,50105,3
50105,"Once washed and dried, the crotch was so small, I couldn't stick a panty liner to it!",50105,3
50106,they are cute shoes I bought three different colors they do stretch out quite a bit which I don't like if you don't need to walk far cute shoe,50106,3
50107,"Style is fine, and the material makes it look flattering.",50107,3
50107,"However, if you are looking for the comfort of a jogger, this might not work as expected as the material is not stretchy at all - contrary to what the title intends to convey, and because of that, it somehow restricts movement.",50107,3
50108,Lighter tan color than expected,50108,3
50109,"The cross was ok but much too big, it was 3 times the size that I expected, the measurements were in millimeters instead of inches so it was very hard to tell what the size really was so I took a chance and ordered it, I sent it back immediately.",50109,3
50109,"If your really looking for a very large cross then this is for you, but much to large for me, I was looking for something about 1 1/4 inches.",50109,3
50110,"Ordered this swimsuit knowing from other reviews that it might not fit properly- I am 5'2"", 110 lbs, 30D and ordered a S (I wear a 4 at H&M and a 00/0 at places like Express, Banana Republic, Anthropoligie etc.).",50110,3
50110,"The top was a little bit big, so I undid the seams connecting the back of the straps and wear it as a neck tied top.",50110,3
50110,The bottoms on the other hand- WAY too small.,50110,3
50110,Those got donated to someone smaller than me and I purchased solid black bottoms elsewhere.,50110,3
50110,"Good deal as a set, but considering only half of it was workable, not so much.",50110,3
50112,Love the suit....but it is too small.,50112,3
50112,I am a 12/L so I ordered the XL and it is still too small.,50112,3
50113,The openings for the arms are too small so it's a little uncomfortable.,50113,3
50113,Otherwise it was the right size.,50113,3
50114,"Wing size is good but the finger elastics are very tiny, tight on my pinky and I have small hands.",50114,3
50114,I needed to replace them myself with a longer piece of elastic and since we are a group of 8 that was alot of unexpected work.,50114,3
50115,"ok for around the house, it's very thin though.",50115,3
50115,I will pair with leggings if I wear it out.,50115,3
50115,Comfy and looks cute.,50115,3
50116,"Rings - They are cute and bought them for models to use during photoshoot but they are a ""one size fit all kind of thing...",50116,3
50117,Not enough room in the crotch.,50117,3
50118,I read some of the reviews and I would agree that it seems to have a cheap feel to it.,50118,3
50118,I still like mine.,50118,3
50119,Well...it IS the right size and color.,50119,3
50119,"BUT...it arrived DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY!!!",50119,3
50119,It will cost more to return than its original cost but is unusable as is.,50119,3
50119,I will try to clean it -what have I got to lose?,50119,3
50119,- but am afraid the navy blue will run.,50119,3
50119,Disappointing for my intended use.,50119,3
50120,I'm a slim lady with a slight belly after four children.,50120,3
50120,My belly is more noticeable to me than to others.,50120,3
50120,This item does not tuck as well As I imagined.,50120,3
50121,"Nice dress, but not true to size",50121,3
50123,It is like a full pant and not like Caprie.im of height 5.2,50123,3
50124,the product was not as full as the picture and i feel that I will have to add more tulle to the petticoat and the waistband is to small so I had to pull the waistband up past my waist which made it shorter,50124,3
50125,I bought this product last Christmas I spent with my sister but the perse broke the first few weeks she was using it the wallet is still OK I felt embarest for I thought it would have  a stronger construction.,50125,3
50126,"I was surprised the the jewelry was gold and stones, I really needed silver and stones.",50126,3
50126,I could not tell when purchasing.,50126,3
50126,Had to buy another set locally.,50126,3
50126,I still have not worn the rhinestones Necklace and bracelet set.,50126,3
50127,Not very sharp when cutting thru gauze and doing dressing changes.,50127,3
50127,Smaller than I expected.,50127,3
50127,"Very cute however, I receive many compliments!",50127,3
50128,I got this for my friend and the handcuffs don't look like hand cuffs but the thought it was counted so she liked it,50128,3
50129,I ordered a large because some of the reviews stated that it ran small.,50129,3
50129,I am 5' 8'' and weigh 133 pounds.,50129,3
50129,I should have ordered the medium.,50129,3
50129,I solved the problem by gathering and clasping the skirt at the side.,50129,3
50129,"However, the material is low quality and will not last very long even though I have washed it in cold water and not put it in the dryer.",50129,3
50129,It's too bad because otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.,50129,3
50129,I ordered two maxi skirts very similar to this one from another manufacturer and the material is much better and the medium fits perfectly.,50129,3

50130,I picked these 3 items because I don't want to shave my private part every time when I want to put on the swim suit.,50130,3
50130,These 3 swim suits all does a great job covering the bikini area.,50130,3
50130,Two of them are 2 piece design and one is one piece design.,50130,3
50130,"My size, normally I wear size 8 petite for bottom and large for top.",50130,3

50130,"Waist: 30"", butt: 36""; height: 5 ft 4"".",50130,3
50130,I can put all of them on without any problem.,50130,3
50130,I am returning 2 and keeping the one that is most comfortable.,50130,3
50130,Size information for B01D8K7HOA: I ordered size 10 as more people think it's bigger than expected than smaller than expected.,50130,3
50130,"- Straps are adjustable from 9"" to 16""
- Bust: is 30"" measure flat, removable bra circle is 5"" diameter
- Waist: as this is a 2 piece design, these is not really waist area, the part after the bra goes from 30"" to 36"" wide.",50130,3
50130,"- Bottom: boy short 26"" flat and you can stretch it out to 32""
- From the top to bottom, it measures 18""

Feedback:
- I like the boy short, but  I like this one the least.",50130,3
50130,"Although the bra padding can be removed, this is the most basic kind that I don't like.",50130,3
50130,It is not designed for someone with huge top as there is no wire support like the other 2.,50130,3
50130,"I don't like the back (halter), I have a hard time to tight it.",50130,3
50130,The position is too high and the fabric is too smooth and it keeps sliding away from my finger tips.,50130,3
50130,I would rate this 75/100 compared to the other 2.,50130,3
50130,"///

Size information for B01H59GO1W: purchased size L based on size chart: 38.5-40"" chest
- Waist is around 28""
- When lay flat without stretching, the bust area measure 32"" (without counting the curve of the cups)
- From top (where the bust area) to bottom of the skirt measure 20""

Features that I like:
- Adjustable shoulder straps, you can change it from 7"" and extend to whole length of 14"", I find the strap slightly uncomfortable
- supportable wired cup
- Removable padding, you can remove it if it does not fit you.",50130,3
50130,I find the padding slightly bigger than the available area.,50130,3
50130,"It is difficult to pull it out, and flatten it out and have it turns and faces the right way after I try to put it back in.",50130,3
50130,"Feedback:
One piece design: depends on your height, you may find it better to buy 2 pieces if you are much taller than me or you wear different sizes of bottom.",50130,3
50130,I think this is perfect for someone who does not have huge tops.,50130,3
50130,"If you have more than C cup, you may not like this one.",50130,3
50130,It maybe good for someone who is between 5 feet to 5 feet 7 based on the length and the shoulder strap.,50130,3
50130,"I do look slimmer in it, especially the waist area based on the design.",50130,3
50130,"As I am not that tall, although it fits me (not too tight, not too loose), I look ""wide"" in it based on the proportion of the dress and my body shape.",50130,3
50130,"I am returning it as I feel the cup padding area is smaller than my actual chest, and I rate this as 85/100 based on its quality and comfort.",50130,3

Size information for B01GX3BT9I size 12, I ordered this size based on my bust.",50130,3
50130,"- Strap is not adjustable, it measures 14"".",50130,3
50130,"As it is wider than B01H59GO1W, I find the strap more comfortable.",50130,3
50130,"- Bust: is 28"" measure flat, meaning, this one come with big curve bra and wired cup, and I can not measure all the curves.",50130,3
50130,I only measure from the back in a straight line.,50130,3

50130,"- Bottom: straight is 30"" but you can stretch it out to 36""
- From top to bottom, it measures around 25"".",50130,3
50130,"Features that I like:
Flexible 2 piece design is great if you need a smaller or bigger bottom.",50130,3
50130,What I like the most is the bra and built in wired.,50130,3
50130,It is really comfortable.,50130,3
50130,"Before I tried it on, I was thinking, the bra looks way too big for me.",50130,3
50130,"Actually, it gives great support.",50130,3
50130,"However, this built in support / wired bra cannot be removed.",50130,3
50130,"Final thought: The layering (cross over) of fabric in the front is a little bit strange, where my finger is pointing.",50130,3
50130,"What I don't like about it, I am kind of chubby, so with that said, this dress does show some meat piling up below the bra area, and above the waist area on the sides.",50130,3
50130,"Depends on how much meat you have on your body and your back, they may be squeezed into layers.",50130,3
50130,It is good for someone want excellent support for their big headlights.,50130,3

50131,"For the price, it's not too bad though.",50131,3
50132,Fit cute but the colors are off in pictures.,50132,3
50132,To me it looks like pink and light blue mixed in.,50132,3
50132,The pants I got are red white and blue..,50132,3
50133,"I was hoping to wear this for an upcoming beach trip, but two things will prevent that.",50133,3
50133,The fit is good every where but the cups.,50133,3
50133,"They are too small, and I thought I could remedy that by buying larger cups and replacing the ones that came with the suit.",50133,3
50133,"Then I noticed the lining is sewn to the top of the bottom part right below the waist, and it is very thin.",50133,3
50133,"So once the suit is wet, it will be see through between the bust and just below the waist.",50133,3
50133,"Also, the draping has raw edges along the bottom of the bust, which makes it look unfinished.",50133,3
50133,"I gave it three stars because it was inexpensive, and I can still wear it at our pool here at home when I'm just hanging out by myself.",50133,3
50134,I'm an a cup and this is still to small.,50134,3
50135,Disposable but only needed for Gasparilla so it served it's purpose.,50135,3
50136,These have very comfortable material.,50136,3
50136,The waste band rolls much too easy.,50136,3
50137,It's ok small fit.,50137,3
50138,Super cute but runs small...,50138,3
50139,Purchased for a Kentucky Derby party and I was envied by other attendees.,50139,3
50140,Materials a little thin and too long,50140,3
50141,Don't like the ruffles on dress.,50141,3
50141,It does not have the same effect as the picture.,50141,3
50142,The only thing i found is that they are smaller than they say they are.,50142,3
50142,Should order at least one or two sizes larger.,50142,3
50142,I ordered an XL which was a medium in reality.,50142,3
50142,"The inside pockets are nice and deep for carrying things like wallets , check book etc.",50142,3
50142,The quality of the vest is good.,50142,3
50142,They are also light weight which in the summer is good.,50142,3
50142,I need a U.S. 2XL.,50142,3
50142,This company says they will have some made and let me know when they receive them.,50142,3
50142,They seem to be very cooperative.,50142,3
50143,Quality was good but nowhere close to fitting.,50143,3
50143,"I'm 5,1 and 160 and ordered a large.",50143,3
50144,To light to hang,50144,3
50145,"Very good quality, but I had to return because it was too small.",50145,3
50145,I originally wear a shirt size 1X and I bought the 3X thinking it would fit but I couldn't even suck in and squeeze the latches together.,50145,3
50146,"Vince Camuto are always 1/0 size smaller than my US normal size, but this one is a whole size smaller, is a shame, the shoes are very pretty and comfortable :(",50146,3
50147,It's a really cute Maxi skirt but I found it a little to big for me.,50147,3
50147,I previously ordered a Large thinking a Medium would be taking a risk without trying it on (Note: I usually wear a Medium but as other reviewers suggested to get a size up I decided to get a Large).,50147,3
50147,To my surprise it was too big for me.,50147,3
50147,I went ahead and ordered a Medium since I really liked this skirt.,50147,3
50147,"When my skirt arrived I was super excited to try it on, but to my surprise again, it was to big.",50147,3
50147,I think they run large.,50147,3
50147,I wish it was a little more true to it's size.,50147,3
50147,But it's a really cute skirt.,50147,3
50148,Wore it once and the stitching is slready coming loose.,50148,3
50148,But it fits and looks great,50148,3
50149,The bag is cute but it has a VERY strong fishy odor.,50149,3
50150,"I love the front looks, not too much in the back...",50150,3
50151,"It's meant to be a cheesy, garish, superfake costume thing and that's what it is.",50151,3
50152,It was not as I expected and I returned it.,50152,3
50152,The top was fitted but the cape was so big that it was not at all usable.,50152,3
50152,I could not wear it at all...,50152,3
50153,"Great shirt ,  however, for a Large looks quite small , I think it's more fitted styling,  should have gotten an XL.",50153,3
50154,"Solved my problem for a quick ugly sweater party, it's a bit large on the sleeves but still looked very good.",50154,3
50155,I bought it for my slim 12 y. o. daughter and she loves it by the way.,50155,3
50155,It is way too small for an average woman though.,50155,3
50155,There was a lot of threads coming out after washing and I end up sewing a whole sleeve back.,50155,3
50155,But overall it is kinda unique and my daughter got a lot of compliments.,50155,3
50156,"Was not the size that I thought it would be... not a lip ring, suitable for eyebrow or nose..",50156,3
50157,Like it but size was a little smaller.,50157,3
50158,"I do wish that the words and image were of a higher quality, very thinly applied and the t shirt fabric shows through.",50158,3
50159,"They look OK, but are very cheaply made.",50159,3
50159,Almost not sure they are actually stainless steel.,50159,3
50159,"The edges are rough, and sharp.",50159,3
50159,I have a feeling these won't last too many off and on's.,50159,3
50159,Note: Be sure you are threading these the correct way!,50159,3
50159,I saw a lot of comments about people not being able to get them on/off.,50159,3
50159,They will on thread on of the back is facing the proper direction.,50159,3
50159,"I'm sure you COULD get them on the other way, but I'm guessing that's why people had trouble getting them off: because the forced them on and cross threaded the cheap threading, forever ruining it.",50159,3
50160,quality could be a bit better,50160,3
50161,"The fit is horrible just like everyone said, but I am going to recut the legs and crotch and put in elastic - pretty easy to do if you are a bit of a seamstress, because the suit is just too cute to send back.",50161,3
50162,Shin did not lasted to long.,50162,3
50163,"Good quality and nice design
Although I ordered extra small, its still kinda larger",50163,3
50164,The picture is just a photo shop R.  The actually shirt is a bad iron on i could have just done at home.,50164,3
50164,The red is so faded on the shirt.,50164,3
50164,"This is not worth $20 , i thought i was going to get a good iron on",50164,3
50165,The bracelet is pretty to look at but I was not pleased when I found out that the bracelet was an overlay instead of being solid sterling silver.,50165,3
50166,Does not fit as expected to fit to hold up pants.,50166,3
50168,The ring shipped and arrived quick.,50168,3
50168,The problem: totally wrong size.,50168,3
50168,"I used the sizing chart, even measured my finger directly, and it came a full two sizes too big!",50168,3
50168,I'm typically a size 8 in jewelry.,50168,3
50168,"The price was good, so I ordered it again, a size 7.",50168,3
50168,The second ring came and  it was still too big.,50168,3
50168,I ordered a third and it finally stays on my finger.,50168,3
50168,"I'm definitely not a size 6, but according to the actual fit I am in this company's sizing.",50168,3
50168,"Recommendation: buyer, order a size lower at least!",50168,3
50168,Seller: adjust your chart to more accurate sizing.,50168,3
50169,Looks nothing like the picture not lace or scoop neck but rather split vneck and has a front pocket.,50169,3
50169,Still a nice shirt so I kept it but not even close to what I thought I was ordering!,50169,3
50171,For a size large the cup area is really small.,50171,3
50171,I wear a 34C and I feel smashed into these bras,50171,3
50172,"Thinner material than I expected, but still good.",50172,3
50173,These are comfy but the Dark Heather color is see through.,50173,3
50173,I have the same pair in black and they are not see through at all.,50173,3
50174,The wood itself is brilliant.,50174,3
50174,The magnate clasp/attachment is nothing to be desired.,50174,3
50174,The metal and magnate are not wide enough to stay in place.,50174,3
50174,It seems best designed for a tshirt rather than a formal collared dress shirt.,50174,3
50174,"I thought this tie with the magnetic clasp would be ideal for young boys, but their energetic spirit doesn't bode well with this design.",50174,3
50175,It fit nicely on the body.,50175,3
50175,Thought it would be longer and more flared.,50175,3
50175,Also it's way too thin.,50175,3
50175,You can see everything.,50175,3
50175,Even the lining of the pockets.,50175,3
50175,Was disappointed because it makes my curves go pow.,50175,3
50176,I ordered a small and it is much shorter than I had anticipated.,50176,3
50176,I will play with the straps to see if I can get it to look more like a mini skirt (I want to wear it with leggings and jeans.,50176,3
50177,this dress was longer than i would have expected.,50177,3
50178,The shoes are adorable but much larger than expected.,50178,3
50178,"The ankle straps helped keep them on my daughter, but they were very floppy on her feet.",50178,3
50179,styling on em but it is fake leather cud been real leather and i queda paid more......its cheap as hell,50179,3
50180,I bought this shirt to announce my pregnancy to my husband.,50180,3
50180,"The shirt fit him perfectly, I think the chart is true to size.",50180,3
50180,The company also shipped immediately.,50180,3
50180,I ordered it Monday night and it was at our house by Wednesday.,50180,3
50180,The only bad side was the print on the shirt was fuzzy and off center.,50180,3
50180,I'm hoping it was a fluke.,50180,3
50180,I contacted the seller and they immediately shipped a new shirt.,50180,3
50180,I'm expecting it any day now.,50180,3
50180,"Other than the printer boo boo (which they corrected) it was a great product, fit well and they provided good customer service.",50180,3
50180,"Ps, my husband adores it and wore it right away.",50180,3
50180,(He didn't mind as much as I did that the printing was fuzzy.,50180,3
50180,He's just happy to be a new dad.,50180,3
50181,I love the style of these.... but they are very wide/loose when on to where i cannot wear them.,50181,3
50182,It is a little snug around the abdomen.,50182,3
50182,I ordered the exact size I wear since the expected fit was a high percent!,50182,3
50182,"If you order, go up a size unless you like form fitting",50182,3
50183,Good quality material but doesn't quite fit well.,50183,3
50183,I'm 32A so the top doesn't fit.,50183,3
50183,Straps keep falling off.,50183,3
50184,There were some imperfections embedded in the materials - two white specks on the front and back.,50184,3
50184,"Also, the fit was true to size, but slightly shorter than expected.",50184,3
50185,"This is a kids size medium, don't fit",50185,3
50186,"Cute, but too small around the arms.",50186,3
50187,It fits like it fits the model.,50187,3
50187,It would have been better it it tapered a little at the waist.,50187,3
50187,The quality is good and it's not a see-through.,50187,3
50187,It's kinda large but can look good if styled properly.,50187,3
50187,It appears to be baggy on the model in the picture too.,50187,3
50187,The depth at the back is just as much as I wanted that is mid-back.,50187,3
50188,I did not really like the quality.,50188,3
50189,The top was more like a sports bra and the skirt was very long.,50189,3
50192,It's a beautiful ring I received so many compliments the color did change though,50192,3
50193,The top was entirely too too small the bottom fit well,50193,3
50194,I wasn't very impressed with this hat.,50194,3
50194,The pom looked much larger in the photo.,50194,3
50194,Just not what I was looking for.,50194,3
50195,Fortunately it didn't cost much.,50195,3
50195,I'll give to my niece since it's too small for me.,50195,3
50195,Cute shirt though and I like the material.,50195,3
50196,Cute and worked for a little while.,50196,3
50196,But after washing it has rubber strands coming out.,50196,3
50196,Which was NOT cute.,50196,3
50197,The top portion is too small and the bottom portion is too big.,50197,3
50197,It does not fully cover my boobs and I got a larger size so that it would do so.,50197,3
50197,I stretched the material across my bra then safety pinned it to my bra when I actually wore it out so the top did not keep sliding and exposing me.,50197,3
50197,I'm only giving it 3 stars because I like the soft but material and it is a cute dress.,50197,3
50198,"The skirt was good quality, came with its needed lining, and true to the color as depicted.",50198,3
50198,"However, it was WAY too small.",50198,3
50198,"I purchased a large expecting it to be a bit large on me, but it fit like a small/medium, in other words a children's large.",50198,3
50198,Too bad - it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.,50198,3
50199,Package arrived on time from Amazon.,50199,3
50199,"The material is soft and somewhat stretchy, however the large was a little to small for me.",50199,3
50200,Not the best.. but not the worst.,50200,3
50200,Sleeves and bottom detail are all polyester and don't look as soft/cottony as what's pictured - I sort of feel like I'm wearing one of those cheapy Halloween costumes with this.,50200,3
50200,Hopefully the pics show what I mean.,50200,3
50200,"Runs small - I'm usually a Med top, I ordered XL.",50200,3
50200,Nice stretch but I'm a little worried about washing.,50200,3
50200,"*The cowl on mine is not as big/layered as what is shown in the pictures*, which is the look I was trying to go for.",50200,3
50200,"One of the four buttons is a little loose, but that's something I can fix.",50200,3
50200,"Slightly disappointed with the item, but I'll be keeping this.",50200,3
50200,I have not washed this item yet.,50200,3
50201,as expected bust area was too big,50201,3
50202,Smaller than I expected,50202,3
50203,As I had expected it to be -- but snags easily.,50203,3
50204,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my adult daughter who is very petite.,50204,3
50204,The bracelet fell right off her wrist.,50204,3
50205,It arrived just as the expected date is indicated.,50205,3
50205,"The shoulders are a bit too big for me, but other than that it seems to fit just fine.",50205,3
50205,The downside is that the picture on this hoodie is actually darker than the one shown in the picture on here.,50205,3
50205,I expected the color to be much brighter or lighter like the one displayed on here also.,50205,3
50205,Another downside is that the picture on this hoodie is actually way off than the one displayed on here since part of the head was cut off and it was just too zoomed in that not the whole picture would fit.,50205,3
50206,Looks so good on!,50206,3
50206,Perfect for the price!!,50206,3
50206,"Update: after 2 months of continuous wear the center ""stone"" fell out.",50206,3
50206,This ring is out of stock and cannot be replaced.,50206,3
50207,came scratched ): other than that very cute,50207,3
50208,Did not label shirt well too small.,50208,3
50209,Webbing material is a bit thinner than some of my others.,50209,3
50209,Design causes the metal to the rear of the catch rings to be exposed with makes the buckle look bigger than I would like but it's OK.,50209,3
50210,These jackets run small.,50210,3
50210,They are especially small across the shoulders and in the arms  Order a jacket at least one size bigger than you normally wear.,50210,3
50211,I wanted to like this top because the fit was perfect!,50211,3
50211,The reason why I decided to return is because I couldn't get used to the bright gold buttons - they made the top look very retro and not in a good way.,50211,3
50211,"If the buttons were black or pewter, I think it would've worked.",50211,3
50211,Maybe it's just the color I ordered... berry + gold buttons = not for me.,50211,3
50212,Fits very low in the front.,50212,3
50212,Will have to wear a camisole or undergarment.,50212,3
50213,I didn't think the pattern resembled the picture at all.,50213,3
50213,"It fit pretty nicely though, like it hugged my shape well.",50213,3
50213,Would give five stars if it had the same look as the picture..,50213,3
50214,"Too many patches, short zipper and bad metal closeure.",50214,3
50215,Dress feels like a nightgown.,50215,3
50215,Applique  is barely on.,50215,3
50215,Glued in some places.,50215,3
50216,Material not the best.,50216,3
50217,Took 2 months to fit but got a newborn size,50217,3
50218,Not the right size,50218,3
50219,Arm holes are very large must wear a tank under this top.,50219,3
50219,The color matches photo in product description.,50219,3
50220,"Ordered these same scrubs a year ago, fit great.",50220,3
50220,"Ordered two more pairs within the last month, both too long and baggy.",50220,3
50220,"I ordered same exact size and I've actually gained weight, so I would have expected them to be a little snug.",50220,3
50220,"Very disappointed, because I liked the way they used to fit.",50220,3
50221,"Too small, but I love the color.",50221,3
50221,I'm hoping to loose weight,50221,3
50222,This doesn't look anything like it does on the model and the sizing online was WAY off!,50222,3
50223,"Bottoms are great, the top is ridiculous no support at all like a tee shirt",50223,3
50224,Very cute loved it,50224,3
50225,"Dress was smaller than I expected, even though I took into account of the other reviewers and ordered a size larger than normal.",50225,3
50225,"I loved the color, just wish it would have fit.",50225,3
50226,"Although the first time I washed it and hung dry, the corner of the iron on started to peel off so a bit disappointed about that.",50226,3
50226,"It is warm and shirt is good quality, but would not recommend simply because it peels.",50226,3
50227,The shape is kind of strange.,50227,3
50227,"It is tight at the bottom of the shirt, but then puffs out in the middle, which does not exactly give the most flattering look.",50227,3
50227,"However, it does look nice as a shell under a suit.",50227,3
50228,"My babies are big for their age, I have a 3 month old who wear 6-9month clothes and her head is on the large size plus I wanted it to fit through the summer so I ordered the 12 month size and its a little big but that's okay.",50228,3
50228,"What's more important than fit is color, I ordered the ""lime"" not looking at the name, but the picture looks like a light cute yellow but when it came it was obviously green, which wasn't what I expected but it was still cute so I kept it.",50228,3
50228,But just be warned that the picture doesn't give a very accurate portrayal of the color.,50228,3
50228,Otherwise I like how soft it is and how long the strings are to tie it.,50228,3
50229,Overall a pretty decent dress.,50229,3
50229,"The fabric is thick and soft, probably more suited for fall than spring or summer.",50229,3
50229,"The shape is mostly as shown in the picture, but the waist isn't very defined.",50229,3
50229,"I bought the small, which according to the size chart is 34.6"" in the bust and 28.3"" in the waist.",50229,3
50229,"The bust fit as expected, but I think the waist was closer to 31"".",50229,3
50229,"It's also very short, barely past the butt on me at 5'7"".",50229,3
50229,"I couldn't find a tag on the dress that provided the fabric composition, but I think it might be more polyester than cotton.",50229,3
50229,"It's currently pretty dry where I live, and this dress was significantly more static-y than a 50% cotton / 50% polyester shirt I own.",50229,3
50230,I ordered a large & received a jacket which fits like an XL even though the tag states it is a large.,50230,3
50230,I recommend ordering a size down.,50230,3
50230,The other reviewers stating that the sizing is off are correct.,50230,3
50230,"Cosmetically, the jacket is great.",50230,3
50230,Sidenote: I've already tried shrinking it in the wash but the results were not desired.,50230,3
50230,Still a tad too big.,50230,3
50231,The fit is smaller than expected.,50231,3
50231,The dress is nicely constructed.,50231,3
50232,Should have been a patch,50232,3
50235,I see that side of the shirt some of the color came off little bit on top and the bottom by the name,50235,3
50236,This thing is H-U-G-E!,50236,3
50236,It's cute but not for me.,50236,3
50237,"Decent pants, ripped after wearing 4 times.",50237,3
50238,Got an XXL because I didn't know how it would fit.,50238,3
50238,I'm 5'3 and it could fit someone that's 5'9.,50238,3
50238,Other than it being too long I love it,50238,3
50239,Skirt band wasn't up to par.,50239,3
50239,"Top was nice, thick material so nothing would show through, even on darker skin tone.",50239,3
50240,i sold it to a friend,50240,3
50241,perfect for what I need,50241,3
50242,"cute suit, it is a bit long and quite bulky, but could even sub for a sundress around the house.",50242,3
50242,"Not really my style, but ok.",50242,3
50244,"The watch itself was ok, but the spring of the carabiner clip broke after a couple months.",50244,3
50244,"I'd hook it on my belt loop anyway, but eventually, it fell off during a hike.",50244,3
50245,These boots are warm and fuzzy inside.,50245,3
50245,They feel lightweight-great for toddlers!,50245,3
50245,My boys liked them but they run small.,50245,3
50245,I ordered these boots a size up and they are very snug fitting with regular cotton socks!,50245,3
50245,My twins like them anyway and want to wear then all day long!,50245,3
50245,I hope they fit through february....,50245,3
50246,I ordered three sizes larger then what I normally wear.,50246,3
50246,The bathing suit does fit however.,50246,3
50246,The suit is very cute and my body looks great in it.,50246,3
50246,But when I received the suit and went to try it on ALL of the buttons on both sides came off!,50246,3
50246,Not too happy about this.,50246,3
50246,Also the straps that are removable and hold the suit up always fall off since they just slide in two loose loops.,50246,3
50247,"I had to bend the latch to get it to work properly, but other than that it seems to work well.",50247,3
50248,it's slightly bigger than club master but ok,50248,3
50249,It's kind of cheap and kind of sharp around the edges.,50249,3
50250,"They are super cute and arrive in fairly secure packaging but when I got them out and tried them on, they were a bit bent and crooked.",50250,3
50250,I have tried carefully bending them to correct it but they are still slightly messed up.,50250,3
50250,"When you set them down on a hard surface, you can clearly see they are bent.",50250,3
50250,Like a wobbly chair.,50250,3
50250,"But if you're just using them for cosplay, they work just fine (especially for that price!",50250,3
50252,I needed shirts to wear after having a baby and the fit worked great.,50252,3
50252,"It's just a little boring to me, it looks ok, but nothing special.",50252,3
50253,But I already lost a ball.,50253,3
50253,So I can't wear them both.,50253,3
50254,This is a huge shirt.,50254,3
50254,My husband is 6' and 170.,50254,3
50254,I bought the medium and he swims in it.,50254,3
50254,It is not slim fit at all.,50254,3
50254,I'm going to have to tailor it to fit him because I don't want to risk the small not fitting his shoulders.,50254,3
50254,"The design is perfect, though, so I am happy with that despite the size issue.",50254,3
50255,It looks nice from a distance.,50255,3
50255,But the purse smells of plastic/nylon.,50255,3
50255,It's not very thin material so that's good.,50255,3
50255,The chain looks prett from far away but it's made of plastic.,50255,3
50255,I'm still using it.,50255,3
50255,Had to let it air out.,50255,3
50255,And I can't make it too heavy because the link can open.,50255,3
50256,Soo cute and it fit as expected in all areas but the chest.,50256,3
50256,"There are underwire cups in the suit, but they did NOT fit.",50256,3
50256,The underwire went across my boobs instead of under.,50256,3
50256,"I readjusted to try to make it fit, but it was uncomfortable.",50256,3
50256,Other than that it was a cute suit that I wished had fit.,50256,3
50257,A little small .,50257,3
50258,Vary see through but besides that it was ok,50258,3
50260,I love the tank tops but I definitly recommend going up a size when ordering.,50260,3
50261,"the short is really nice, the colors are vibrant just as the picture show.",50261,3
50261,unfortunately the wrong size was sent.,50261,3
50261,I ordered a size M and the short was a size S. I had to return it,50261,3
50262,Guess you get what you pay for quality of the fabric wasn't that good but it's good for the price.,50262,3
50263,"Pretty pattern, runs very small",50263,3
50264,"As stated any times here, These do not stay screwed together.",50264,3
50264,The ends pop off very easy,50264,3
50265,"Great design, material is a little thinner than expected.",50265,3
50265,"One size does fit all by any means, on the small side.",50265,3
50266,Much smaller than expected,50266,3
50267,Not a big fan...it's really short and the material is shiny like a swimsuit.,50267,3
50268,I like ths shirt but it started Fallon apart at the seams after the first wash.,50268,3
50270,I bought these for one reason: protection on snowy days.,50270,3
50270,"Protection from cleaning the snow off the car, or even having a snow fight.",50270,3
50270,"Today I was able to put them to the test, they failed.",50270,3
50270,"While I cleaned the snow off my SUV, my fingers began to feel frozen.",50270,3
50270,"They began to hurt, and I began to think of the review I would give.",50270,3
50271,"nice but too small, I ordered my size 7 but it fit tighter than my other size 7 rings, which fits loosely, so you might want to order a 1/2 size larger",50271,3
50272,"Arrived in a plastic bag, no shoebox.",50272,3
50272,But they appear new.,50272,3
50272,Colors are true to the photo .,50272,3
50272,"Black part is suede,  which was a surprise, but I don't mind it.",50272,3
50272,Order a half size to a full-size up.,50272,3
50272,My kiddo is in a 1 with room to wiggle in every other shoe we have.,50272,3
50272,No room to grow in this 1.,50272,3
50272,"Unfortunately, we won't get much time out of this pair.",50272,3
50273,"I needed a blazer fast, and this did the trick.",50273,3
50273,"However, I don't really like that ""shiny"" or ""sheen-like"" thing that this blazer has going on.",50273,3
50273,"It looks like it should be listed as a JUNIORS clothing item, in my opinion.",50273,3
50274,"This shirt is okay, it's pretty sheer and the arms seem a little tight at the top, and I don't have big arms.",50274,3
50275,"too small, i can;t wear",50275,3
50276,Shirt was smaller than expected.,50276,3
50276,I got an xl and it was still really tiny.,50276,3
50277,"Nice fabric, comfy feel but I ordered up one size--the sizing recommendations for height/weight on the package are totally unreal.",50277,3
50278,So the actual product doesn't really look like the stock pictures.,50278,3
50278,"The fabric is thinner, and there is a weird seam on the bicep area that isn't obvious in the stock pictures.",50278,3
50278,"I'm 5'3"" 110lbs and got the small and it's a bit tighter than I expected, which isn't a huge deal I just think it's relevant to this review.",50278,3
50278,"It also will not stay on my shoulders, as you can see in the pictures, so I'll have to use fashion tape to get it to stick when I actually wear it out.",50278,3
50278,"I kind of expected that, so not a huge deal.",50278,3
50278,"I just wish the fabric has been more sweater like, like it appears to be in the photos, but overall it's an ok top.",50278,3
50278,(sorry about the wrinkles in the photos - had just taken it out of the package),50278,3
50279,I gave them to my 9 yr old daughter.,50279,3
50280,"Club top is separate, not a romper.",50280,3
50281,it's not as red as it looks on screen,50281,3
50282,Sweater is too short.,50282,3
50282,"The chest fits ok, there 3 stars.",50282,3
50282,I'm 5'11 and sweater comes down to my belly button.,50282,3
50282,I have bought many things from Uxcell.,50282,3
50282,But would not recommend this particular purchase.,50282,3
50284,this is really short and unfortunately the lining is a lot shorter but good color and nice fabric,50284,3
50285,Good quality but XS is way too big for me -- wasted my money :-(,50285,3
50286,"It actually came with one of the chains not attached, but I think I can re-attach it.",50286,3
50286,"Other than that, it's nice!",50286,3
50287,"I thought when o bought this, it would look a little more expensive than it did .",50287,3
50287,It looks more like a cheap piece of costume jewelry.,50287,3
50287,"It work well for cutting it apart an pinning it in my daughters hair, as an hair accessory .",50287,3
50288,For me they looked prettier online,50288,3
50289,"Doesn't shade the sun, for style and looking cool only.",50289,3
50292,It's beautiful and it has nice color but the card pockets are little small.. but i like it,50292,3
50293,Description should include color>(,50293,3
50294,"Love the suit, great quality, how ever if you are a D cup or larger top won't cover.",50294,3
50295,Item is decent quality.,50295,3
50295,It is a chubby wallet with having two sections.,50295,3
50295,One with an accordion section for holding 10 credit cards and another section that you could put folded bills.,50295,3
50297,"you get what you pay for, this suit is exactly what I expected, I love the fit and the style, the top is exactly like several other suits that I purchased the same day under different pictures depicting different styles, they look beaded and aren't, beware that these suits are the same as many others listed for $6, just get one, they take forever to get here from china, come in a cool bag, but better to go to Walmart for a cheap suit, just try it on there and go, waste of time and energy",50297,3
50298,Item is sized improperly.,50298,3
50298,Sadly I am unable to wear my item.,50298,3
50298,Their size chart is in no way correct for the sizing they are stating their product fits women.,50298,3
50299,"Looks good and quality is not bad for the price, but size is not right.",50299,3
50299,"I ordered adult XL, but it is more like a size M.",50299,3
50300,"I guess I felt a little weird in it because I'm bigger than the model >_< 5' 5""  160 lbs.",50300,3
50301,it fits too short.,50301,3
50301,more like a top than a dress.,50301,3
50301,"i am 5ft 9"" and the dress length reaching me where her knuckles of her left hand is.",50301,3
50301,i would definitely use it with shorts or a leggings,50301,3
50302,"I went with the sizing chart and got a 1x, but upon arrival I couldn't even get it around my waist.",50302,3
50302,"I'm a big girl, standing at a intimidating 5'3"" and about 210 pounds.",50302,3
50302,I should've gotten a few sizes bigger.,50302,3
50303,This shirt didn't fit exactly the way I thought it would.,50303,3
50303,It's kind of tight around the neck and too big in the arms.,50303,3
50304,to big and havy but ok,50304,3
50305,I was expecting it smaller it's just way to big for me,50305,3
50306,when from China things are unpredictably smaller.,50306,3
50307,"This too from the same company was a very comfortable fit, a great summer and lazy day dress but the ties tore in just a few washes!",50307,3
50308,Material is too thin.,50308,3
50308,You can see right through.,50308,3
50309,My daughter wears a size 5 in sneakers but these were falling off her feet.,50309,3
50310,I wear medium sometimes small so I ordered the medium.,50310,3
50310,It cuts into my arm pits.,50310,3
50310,I love the top and will return for a large.,50310,3
50311,"I bought this belt to send it to my daughter in Cuba and she wrote me saying that she had something small, but that she found it very good.",50311,3
50312,"This is a really cute nursing bra and fit as expected, but my boobs keep falling out of the cups, which defeats the purpose of wearing a bra.",50312,3
50313,"It's ok chain is too long constantly in my shoe, i guess you get what you pay for it.",50313,3
50314,"I really like the fabric, length and overall look of this dress but the fit didn't work for me.",50314,3
50314,"It was a bit big in the waist and although it fit fine in the chest, the bottom seam of the ""wrap"" at the neckline came up to the middle of my breasts.",50314,3
50314,"For context, I wear a 32FF bra size (UK sizing).",50314,3
50314,"If you are hourglass and want a faux wrap, these fit really well:

50315,It broke almost immediately.,50315,3
50316,Great material and quality.,50316,3
50316,"The cut is great, but it runs a little smaller than other shirts.",50316,3
50317,"Doesn't really look like the picture, but they were cheap and they fit nice.",50317,3
50317,The colors are not as good at the picture portrays.,50317,3
50318,Kinda thick feeling and snug.,50318,3
50318,I was hoping for a thinner material.,50318,3
50318,If you are looking for a spandex feeling this is great.,50318,3
50318,Not real real binding but holds you together.,50318,3
50318,Good quality but runs small.,50318,3
50319,My girlfriend loved it.,50319,3
50319,Only thing is after a few weeks the gold comes off and turns your finger a different color so she stopped wearing it.,50319,3
50320,I ordered a large and while it it very lose in the top and arm area it is kind is tight in the hips so plan accordingly,50320,3
50321,Ok for teen that will outgrow fast..not high quality but goid enough for price paid,50321,3
50322,I was absolutely thrilled when I opened up my pretty turquoise box with a nice velvet like jewelry bag.,50322,3
50322,The earrings were almost exactly as they showed on the Amazon website.,50322,3
50322,The quality of the rhinestones on these earrings are absolutely beautiful.,50322,3
50322,"Unfortunately, a gray rhinestone was missing from one of the earrings near the bottom of the dangling earring.",50322,3
50322,"Inside the box, there were small clear rhinestone replacements, but not the correct one to replace on my pair of earrings.",50322,3
50322,"I need to use the earrings in the next few days,so I can't return them for a different pair, and there was no contact information or website to contact Ever Faith Jewelry company.",50322,3
50322,"A lot of their jewelry is absolutely gorgeous,  I am hesitant to do any further purchases with Ever Faith.",50322,3
50322,I would've preferred to leave this information directly with their company Could not contact them :-(.,50322,3
50324,"it's ok for the price, didn't have the room i needed to put my stuff in.",50324,3
50325,very pretty and good value however too small to work on most tables,50325,3
50326,Cute suit but you get what you pay for.,50326,3
50326,Fabric is not the best.,50326,3
50327,"I like them, but I did not realize how big they were, the frames themselves feel like they are a little big for my head, and they do no come with a bag like it say's either.",50327,3
50327,"But for the price, they are really nice!",50327,3
50328,kinda feels like a toy around your wrist and always comes undone,50328,3
50329,Zipper is easy to took out when I do zip up.,50329,3
50331,Same as many other people-- patterns shown are not what you get.,50331,3
50331,I also was interested in tractor patterns.,50331,3
50332,"This print is beautiful, but the bottom of the kimono is SO small.",50332,3
50332,"The rest is large and flows, the bottom pulls it back about half way across my thighs.",50332,3
50332,"I think it might look fine on someone much smaller, but I'm not sure because it is so large otherwise.",50332,3
50332,I'm going to give it to a friend and see if it fits her okay.,50332,3
50333,its runs more large but it fits ok,50333,3
50334,I ordered a size down in this costume based on reviews stating that it ran very large.,50334,3
50334,"Although, the top part has an elastic section in the back which makes the material rather bulky looking.",50334,3
50334,It's not very flattering on my pear-shaped figure.,50334,3
50334,"The shiny material that the cape, skirt, and boot covers are made of don't ship well.",50334,3
50334,"They end up sticking together in shipment and as you're pulling it apart, the material gets discolored.",50334,3
50334,"Not too bad, but something to consider.",50334,3
50334,"I actually wish I would have ordered a different version of the Wonder Woman costume, but, oh well.",50334,3
50335,Not at tight as i would like they look great wearing just don't fit snug and fall off.,50335,3
50335,They just fall right off.,50335,3
50336,board molds a little too much as you wear it so it doesnt give enough pressure,50336,3
50337,First Jones New York that I wasn't thrilled with.,50337,3
50337,Super nice knit but the side seaming is wonky.,50337,3
50337,It doesn't lay smooth.,50337,3
50337,I haven't even worn it yet.,50337,3
50337,"Yes I'm a reviewer that is going to say ""wish I had returned it.""",50337,3
50337,It may get some use this winter.,50337,3
50337,I'm having a hard time figuring out what to wear on top.,50337,3
50337,I tried a Sags Harbor pullover black sweater and it just looked frumpy.,50337,3
50337,Maybe a short sleeve sweater.,50337,3
50337,Not my first failed purchase.,50337,3
50337,I will for sure update later if I can find some saving grace for it.,50337,3
50338,It look good but I order Xl look like Small,50338,3
50339,"For the price, the gift set appears to be of great quality.",50339,3
50339,It is definitely a handsome set.,50339,3
50339,I'm rating 3 stars only because my better half haven't worn it yet.,50339,3
50341,It's a nice bangle holder.,50341,3
50341,But it came chipped :(,50341,3
50342,"Felt like a stuffed sausage in it, but that's probably because I eat like a Hobbit.",50342,3
50342,This probably looks awesome on someone with a slender figure.,50342,3
50344,This thing stretched out so bad after only one season.,50344,3
50344,I am short and it fits like a dress.,50344,3
50345,I bought as a gift.,50345,3
50346,"Its cute, a little small and the smell was a little strong.",50346,3
50347,nedded to order a larger size.,50347,3
50348,"The color is really pretty, and it is as pictured, but the the pockets bulge out in an unflattering way.",50348,3
50348,"The sleeves are a bit too puffy for my taste, a bit more than the photo shows.",50348,3
50349,"This is exactly what I wanted, a good cover for tank tops whose straps are too skinny to be worn to work.",50349,3
50349,"However the material doesn't seem durable, I don't think these will last me an entire school year.",50349,3
50349,That's OK as they are cheap and I can reorder as needed.,50349,3
50350,It runs very small.,50350,3
50350,I got it in XL and it was still to small.,50350,3
50350,gave it to my daughter whom is a size 8/9 and it fits her prefect.,50350,3
50351,"This top is actually blue and dark khaki brown, not white as it looks like in the photo.",50351,3
50351,Not happy with it at all.,50351,3
50351,It's also a bit too small for me.,50351,3
50351,"Oh well, had the color been what what I thought, I would have kept it.",50351,3
50352,Would recommend ordering this a size larger.,50352,3
50353,The white lettering is a little faded and not as bright as depicted in the picture.,50353,3
50354,I really love the design but this would be better with an actual sizing option.,50354,3
50354,"After one wear it stretched out and got saggy around the armholes, and I am a small-framed woman.",50354,3
50354,Thinking about sending it back b/c I suspect the stretch is going to disappear completely at this rate.,50354,3
50355,a little big I color its nice,50355,3
50356,The dress in the picture and the one that arrived are different.,50356,3
50356,The sleeves are shorter and have flowers on them.,50356,3
50357,Looks better in the pictures than in actuality.,50357,3
50359,Cheap chain with no clasp.,50359,3
50360,not the right color as the pickture,50360,3
50361,"After reading all the reviews about the size, I got an XXL (I'm usually a us 8-10) the XXL feels like a US 6.",50361,3
50362,Okay sweater for keeping on the back of your chair at work.,50362,3
50363,Shoe looks great but returming do to size  -  too small,50363,3
50364,"I know it is a precious stone, but it looks good.",50364,3
50364,"Don't try to fool anybody, although it is a good fake.",50364,3
50365,Very nice but to big,50365,3
50366,Cute cover up the only thing is one size only,50366,3
50367,I thought they would have been more comfortable.,50367,3
50367,Quality is not the best.,50367,3
50367,They do their job for a few hours but you do want to take them off after a while.,50367,3
50368,"The posts aren't mounted straight, so getting this thing straight on a uniform is a bit of a trick.",50368,3
50368,"My jacket has a badge patch, and this worked well to place a mourning band over that patch.",50368,3
50369,It's a nice shirt and I'm able to wear it because it has a bit of stretchiness in it but I got an XL and it's pretty tight for that size.,50369,3
50369,My advice is to go up one size,50369,3
50370,One pair got a hole as I was putting them on.,50370,3
50370,"These reviews don't lie, they're pretty low quality.",50370,3
50371,It was smaller than I expected.,50371,3
50371,I guess I should have read the measurements better.,50371,3
50371,Its really like a lunch tote size.,50371,3
50371,It's also thinner than I expected it to be.,50371,3
50372,My standards for this suit was relatively low because I wasn't paying a lot of for it.,50372,3
50372,So I'm pretty happy with it.,50372,3
50372,However I followed the size chart and it came out pretty snug.,50372,3
50372,I have a long torso and it felt like it came short.,50372,3
50373,Looks good but my girlfriend said it's made with low quality on the made of it.,50373,3
50373,But maybe it is fair for the price.,50373,3
50375,Im sadly disappointed with this.,50375,3
50375,It has a strange smell to the garment which I can deal with after dry cleaning.,50375,3
50375,My issue is the fit.,50375,3
50375,It fit tight around the legs or butt area.,50375,3
50375,"It is a bit short for a person that is 5' 7"" which makes it look borderline high water.",50375,3
50375,My chest is a 34D and it fit way too big and loose.,50375,3
50375,It would look good if you had bigger chest or implants otherwise will make you look oddly flat chested no matter what you do with it.,50375,3
50375,Im athletic build so might be the muscle development hindering the fit in that area or I  have to lose about 1/2 inch on my butt to make it fit good and I need some implants on my chest to fill it in.,50375,3
50375,I cant go bigger or smaller.,50375,3
50375,Im stuck between returning it.,50375,3
50376,The dress was about two sizes too small.,50376,3
50376,But it is really cute.,50376,3
50377,This was a toss up between 3 and 3 1/2 stars.,50377,3
50377,I was excited to receive this item because I loved the style and the color.,50377,3
50377,"I got it, ripped it open like a kid on Christmas, tossed it on and found out it was too small.",50377,3
50377,I ordered a medium because I did not want it to be baggy and the size chart seemed to fit my measurements.,50377,3
50377,"Ultimately, it did not.",50377,3
50377,"My shoulders were too broad, so the size discrepancy is the only reason I knocked it down a few stars.",50377,3
50377,I am always skeptical about buying clothes online and this experience is why.,50377,3
50377,"Beyond the size though, I loved the shirt.",50377,3
50377,The mix of materials give it a great feel.,50377,3
50377,"It is very light and if mine weren't too small, I believe it would be very airy as well.",50377,3
50377,There is a good chance I go back and buy a different color in a large.,50377,3
50378,I order one size larger to be on the safe side that it would fit but it is still to small.,50378,3
50378,I gave it to my daughter unstead of the time consuming return.,50378,3
50380,"one size fits all for skinny girls... :( gave it to my lil sis, super cute if it fits you, see-through fabric comes with white bra pads",50380,3
50381,Heel broke off in less than 6 months.,50381,3
50382,"I knew I was taking a gamble ordering this, but at this price it was worth it.",50382,3
50382,"I'm pretty sure this is a knockoff of a shirt sold by another company (don't know if I'm allowed to say which one here), but it's a third of the price.",50382,3
50382,"The fabric is sort of thin and seems somewhat fragile, but not as bad as some other clothes I've ordered from China.",50382,3
50382,I would say the picture is basically accurate to the look.,50382,3
50382,"My biggest gripe is that the shirt is a bit too small, and especially tight/short in the sleeves.",50382,3
50382,"I am 5'3"" and 110lbs., so I ordered the Small, but I wish I had ordered the Medium.",50382,3
50383,It runs really small,50383,3
50384,These are ok shorts.,50384,3
50384,The material is a little cheap though but still pretty cute,50384,3
50385,This dress is wayyy to small and tight.,50385,3
50385,I ordered a 4xl and I wear a 3xl and it still didn't fit.,50385,3
50385,The dress runs small.,50385,3
50385,I must admit tho it is a beautiful dress!,50385,3
50386,arm is great except its a little on the large side.. doesnt balance with my right arm.. like i have one big hulk arm haha,50386,3
50387,"Tie looks nice and fit well, however it will need to be steamed before wear as it is extremely wrinkled upon arrival.",50387,3
50388,keeps falling lower even after i adjusted the middle part,50388,3
50389,I'm 5'6 140 lbs and got a size medium.,50389,3
50389,"Fabric is very stretchy and it is a very cute romper but was short in the legs to where I can where it because my butt will show, very cute with a long cardigan!",50389,3
50390,LOVE these socks so much..the only problem is that they run very small.,50390,3
50391,The dress is beautiful.,50391,3
50391,Doesn't feel or look super cheap.,50391,3
50391,The white lace/beaded part wasn't all the way attached to a lot of places on the dress but nothing some super glue can't fix.,50391,3
50391,I measured my sister before ordering so I ordered her an 8 per the sizing.,50391,3
50391,And it was definitely around 2 sizes to small.,50391,3
50392,Kinda big but cool,50392,3
50393,If you have any sort of boobs go larger.,50393,3
50393,I wear a size 36 d and couldn't get it over my chest.,50393,3
50393,The shorts fit okay,50393,3
50394,the bottom is way smaller then the top size,50394,3
50395,Pretty but to big,50395,3
50397,"I usually wear S. I ordered M, based on reviews.",50397,3
50397,And the M fits like XS.,50397,3
50397,So go 2 sizes up.,50397,3
50397,"It's a pretty design though, and it's made of thick stretchy synthetic fabric (probably, not ideal for a hot summer).",50397,3
50397,"The white gaps come through the color when it's stretched, thus losing its brightness.",50397,3
50397,I reordered a L. Let's see how that one fits...,50397,3
50398,Hip and stylish harem capri pants.,50398,3
50398,A bit snug in the waist and the calves.,50398,3
50399,Adorable - yet awful chemical smell upon arrival.,50399,3
50399,Washed on gentle and came out without earmuffs and pompoms!!,50399,3
50399,They were GLUED no sewn!!,50399,3
50399,and they didn't survive.,50399,3
50400,I would have liked an xtra small option,50400,3
50401,"I can't even wear it, hard to figure it how to put together, different then the picture.",50401,3
50401,But is ship very fast.,50401,3
50402,Which aligator clip part was covered in fabric as well to prohibit scratching head.,50402,3
50403,"The hips part is tighter then the top fold part which looks uncomfortable, however the baby didn't complain!",50403,3
50403,The top had lose threads... nothing a needle and thread didn't fix but that's the last  thing I want to do after buying a product,50403,3
50404,It's either sticking out way too far or sliding all the way through the pierced hole and floating around my nostril.,50404,3
50404,Too small for me.,50404,3
50405,"The concept is very good ,The look is very nice
My issue is that they fall off  very easily ,if you turn your head very quickly they will slip off",50405,3
50407,The top was very large and i have dd n it was too bigg the bottom fit great but had to return,50407,3
50408,I love this pants so much that this is my 5th pair!,50408,3
50408,"However, these pink ones are super long.",50408,3
50408,They don't stop mid shin like my others.,50408,3
50408,They are full on pants and the waist is higher than ever too.,50408,3
50408,"Also, day one of wearing them a long string unraveled from the hem.",50408,3
50408,Then I noticed they are completely see thru.,50408,3
50408,My other colors are not see thru at all but these pants are like a completely different brand they are that different.,50408,3
50409,I ordered an xlarge because I'm usually a medium and occasionally a large.,50409,3
50409,"I also wanted to wear it strictly as a dress so the longer the better, the extra large is huge!",50409,3
50409,I should have gotten a medium or maybe a large....,50409,3
50409,It's cute just a little long and big.,50409,3
50409,I think it'll look okay with heels but if you are ordering get your normal size,50409,3
50410,I like it but would like it if the stretch around the neck was a little looser.,50410,3
50411,Need lengths as well as size.,50411,3
50412,More gray than cream in person,50412,3
50413,Cute but I got to loose some weight,50413,3
50414,the diamond are very tiny.,50414,3
50414,and it easy to flip over so the sparks side won't always shown.,50414,3
50414,make a look not worth it.,50414,3
50415,Smaller than the size chart.,50415,3
50416,In the photo they look black but they were more like really dark denim,50416,3
50417,To wear too much.,50417,3
50417,"Return is too troublesome, really depressed.",50417,3
50418,"Originally I scored a 1 star; however, I have changed by ratings to 3 based on the level of customer service the seller has provided after reading my original review about not being happy with the print and feel of the material.",50418,3
50418,"Seller, Anna, let me know she valued her customers feedback and has been working with manufacturers to make changes.",50418,3
50418,Anna asked if I would be willing to accept the new product and test for her.,50418,3
50418,"This level of customer service is 5 star, I'm hopeful the new product will be too.",50418,3
50419,People think this shirt is cute.,50419,3
50420,Was only able to wear it twice due to all the last tearing,50420,3
50421,Overall I really love these pants.,50421,3
50421,"They're very soft and a thin, light material.",50421,3
50421,"That being said, they're more like leggings or pajama pants than yoga pants.",50421,3
50421,"I wouldn't wear these out of the house because they're such a thin, light material that you can somewhat see through them in the light and it really feels like you're wearing pajamas.",50421,3
50421,I definitely would not wear them to workout (unless I was at home).,50421,3
50421,I got them to lounge around in at home and they're perfect for that.,50421,3
50421,They also stretch out after a day of wearing them so you have to wash them regularly to get them back to size.,50421,3
50421,They're great depending on what you want them for.,50421,3
50422,I like it for the style and light.,50422,3
50422,Doesn't look or feel sturdy.,50422,3
50422,Good for having in a fixed place.,50422,3
50422,Makes a humming noise.,50422,3
50423,"It's okay, the weaving could be better.",50423,3
50424,"Got for my wife as present, very cheap",50424,3
50425,Love these but they are completely see through.,50425,3
50428,"I thought the design was part of the pendant, but it's actually a picture under a glass bead.",50428,3
50429,"Having purchased this gown for a gift, I was willing to pay the price for organic and quality.",50429,3
50429,I also liked the idea of sharing the proceeds with their non-profit partners.,50429,3
50429,It is correct that the gown is very soft as described.,50429,3
50429,"The color wasn't exactly as I expected from the picture, but I do really like the design.",50429,3
50429,"The disappointment is that it was made in China..  From what I read when I ordered, I had no idea or I would not have selected it.",50429,3
50430,This dress was very heavy.,50430,3
50430,I felt like I was wearing my weight in taffeta.,50430,3
50430,"The top was extremely sturdy, it could have stood up on it's own, most likely so that you didn't have to wear a bra with it.",50430,3
50430,It was true to size.,50430,3
50430,"I might have kept it anyway since it was so affordable and was very lovely, high quality, but the zipper was broken out of the package.",50430,3
50430,"Since it was so heavy and hot, I ended up returning instead of getting a replacement.",50430,3
50430,"I honestly think it would be ok if I was going to be somewhere colder, but this would be much too hot for Florida.",50430,3
50430,"I gave it three stars for the broken zipper, which was very disappointing.",50430,3
50431,The dress was much more sheer than it shows in the picture.,50431,3
50432,belt came a different color and material.,50432,3
50434,"This dress is pretty, but NOT true to color.",50434,3
50434,I ordered ivory and it is bright white.,50434,3
50435,"It's a really cute hat, but it fit too large, I returned it.",50435,3
50436,I love my case!,50436,3
50436,"I get so many compliments about it, but it's starting to crack in some spots and the magnetic clasp is starting to fall apart which is a bummer.",50436,3
50436,Keeps my id's insurance card and debit cards secure.,50436,3
50437,They seem shorter than they use to be.,50437,3
50438,"The inside of this bag had to be repaired shortly after I started using it :( I did not have it too full, however, the inside started to rip by the zipper pouches :(",50438,3
50439,This is a cute top that can be worn with fun patterned leggings or jeans.,50439,3
50439,"However, even though I read the reviews it is not what I expected.",50439,3
50439,"The item is listed and described correctly, but based on the photo and my own search I was expecting more of a thin sweatshirt material.",50439,3
50439,This is made of t shirt material.,50439,3
50439,"It is also very soft, and the heart is nicely embossed.",50439,3
50439,"I don't dry tops like this, so based on the quality I don't expect that it will crack or fade easily.",50439,3
50439,It is much better quality than similar shirts I have purchased for twice as much.,50439,3
50439,"This is an excellent value, and I plan to wear it often out and about running errands and for working out in cooler weather.",50439,3
50439,I also like the comfort and appearance of the wide neck.,50439,3
50439,Overall I would recommend this top.,50439,3
50440,"I order d a size 10 in a different color they fit, but I haven't worn them yet.",50440,3
50440,This is a 1.5 size smaller than my normal sneaker size.,50440,3
50441,Not so good either.,50441,3
50441,Whites are more like grey in reality.,50441,3
50442,Just a little disappointed in this product.....I picked the right size but it runs small........,50442,3
50443,there are better ones out there.,50443,3
50443,it falls down to easily.,50443,3
50444,I think it's just the sizing for the dc shoes because both of the size 11s I purchased for my daughter were smaller than expected.,50444,3
50444,Cute shoes for a good price though.,50444,3
50445,"Cute dress, but it made me look like I was preggo.",50445,3
50446,After a couple washes it's a ball of junk.,50446,3
50446,The holes in the back got all messed up,50446,3
50447,Low quality synthetic material with poor stitching.,50447,3
50447,Got the largest size and was still tiny.,50447,3
50447,Wont buy from here again.,50447,3
50448,maybe I bought a ladies design?,50448,3
50449,It was ok but I guess not what I was expecting.,50449,3
50450,The legging was small in the waist and a little large in the chin.,50450,3
50450,The fabric is good.,50450,3
50451,"Looks great but not very durable, one drop and that was the end of that for me...",50451,3
50452,These are fair glasses!,50452,3
50452,Cant say I would buy them again!,50452,3
50453,I'm sending this back because the color is two tone on the back and it's very stretchy so I would need a smaller size.,50453,3
50453,I wear 14 and 5 ft 9(it's a lil short on me) bought a large I need a medium for all the stretch.,50453,3
50454,Helps keep my Back straight.,50454,3
50455,This is a very pretty dress.,50455,3
50455,Our grand daughter truelly loved it but was heart broken on Christmas day when the zipper was broken as recieved.,50455,3
50455,"We didn't have the heart to send it back so we pinned it until grandma could replace the zipper, which is no easy task",50455,3
50456,Would have given it a 5 if it actually was the same as shown in the picture.,50456,3
50456,Yes it said blue and that they are solid blue - but the picture represents lot nicer looking bags.,50456,3
50456,Wished people would put the pictures of true product they are selling.,50456,3
50456,These were more pleasing to the eye than what I got - but all is well - just disappointed !,50456,3
50456,"As far as the product seems ok, appears to be made well, will be using them in couple of weeks so hopefully the product performs well.",50456,3
50457,The case is very cute.,50457,3
50457,My only issue is that there is too much space around the case that it is hard to put the phone on vibrate and stick in the charger or headphones.,50457,3
50458,Was a cute bag while away on vaca.,50458,3
50458,Unfortunately threw it out after the first wash.,50458,3
50461,Nice piece and nice size but has tarnished so bad after only one season of club vball (so not that long) that I now have to replace.,50461,3
50462,I just got this yesterday.,50462,3
50462,"When I ordered it I thought it would be different than it was-wider shoulder straps, more roomy inside and the outer pocket would be big enough for my kindle.",50462,3
50462,Color was great... there was no funny smell that other customers had reported.,50462,3
50462,There is something odd going on with the stitching inside so that the inner pockets don't fully make pockets.,50462,3
50462,I used it yesterday afternoon and now is sitting in my closet.,50462,3
50462,I think for the right person this would be a great bag but for me 5 hours of use was enough.,50462,3
50463,The dress is waaay shorter than I expected it to be and just a tad bit tighter around the chest but otherwise fits perfectly.,50463,3
50463,If you were getting this for an Eleven costume like I was then the neckline is just a bit too low for a Peter Pan collar.,50463,3
50463,Overall it's a cute dress.,50463,3
50464,"They seem to be great quality, but the sizing is WAY off.",50464,3
50464,"Bump up one size, maybe even two, if you want some extra growing room.",50464,3
50464,"It's also 100% cotton, so there may be shrinkage.",50464,3
50464,"I have just taken them out of the bag, and I'm disappointed since I probably don't have time to return and reorder before I need them for Christmas Eve.",50464,3
50465,Cute shirt but bad material....did not have any stretch,50465,3
50466,Pretty and well made but way to small to cover actual breasts.,50466,3
50466,"Not everyone is tiny on top and wide in the caboose, some of us are in proportion.",50466,3
50467,"Gave to daughter, she likes it.",50467,3
50468,"Lovely color, too small and a bit see through - just needed a nude body suit underneath.",50468,3
50469,The buckle was too complicated for my husband.,50469,3
50470,These shoes look good in person.,50470,3
50470,But unfortunately they run between a half to full size to small.,50470,3
50470,Very narrow as well.,50470,3
50470,The back of the shoe also seemed to sit a little below the middle of my child's heal which made the shoe even more uncomfortable for her to wear.,50470,3
50470,I couldn't see her wearing this shoe all day at school.,50470,3
50471,I ordered the non-fleeced version.,50471,3
50471,They are thicker then I expected and more of a wool weave style texture.,50471,3
50471,If your wearing a catchy fabric over these its going to ride up on this non-smooth material.,50471,3
50471,I cant say I found them very comfortable but perhaps because they run slightly smaller then expected.,50471,3
50472,I couldn't decide if I wanted to rate these a 3 or a 4.,50472,3
50472,The package provided was a different color than is shown here but still cute (just don't buy these if the color is the only thing your interested in)  The Micky image on the orange pair is like an iron on and I'm not sure how it will hold up to all the washes we may need while potty training (but than again we hope to not be potty training for too long).,50472,3
50472,"My son has a large volume of urine and when he has ""accidents"" in normal underwear it soaks his shoes so we thought these would help to absorb some of the ""extra"" so we could at least save his shoes from needing to be washed each time.",50472,3
50472,There is extra padding in the front as well as the back.,50472,3
50472,"These aren't to be used as a diaper so they will still make the pants wet but a better than the ""normal"" underwear.",50472,3
50472,They run a bit small.,50472,3
50472,My son wears 2T pants and they are sometimes too big but we ordered a 3T for these and they fit perfect.,50472,3
50472,(we also bough the Mickey training pants and the Thomas ones as well).,50472,3
50473,It's really not like the one in the show.,50473,3
50473,The pearls are to small.,50473,3
50473,But still a nice neclace,50473,3
50474,They are also a but thin.,50474,3
50475,The fit is on the small side.,50475,3
50476,Some of the rings already came turned tarnished and the rest were good.,50476,3
50477,"This does run a tad big, it's very adorable.",50477,3
50477,"However, I didn't rate it a 5 star because the 1st wash on delicate cycle and the bow fell off.",50477,3
50477,"Also, washed in cold and the blue ran onto the ivory.",50477,3
50477,Other then that I'm fixing the bow and using this for pictures.,50477,3
50478,Swing dress fits well.,50478,3
50478,"a bit shorter ten I would like, but wear leggings and it's fine.",50478,3
50479,It's a little small on me.,50479,3
50479,"But i love the way it feels, it came in on time and i believe a few days early.",50479,3
50480,"It fit fairly well except inthe chest , other then that the color was nice and the langh was nice.",50480,3
50481,Better as beach cover up.,50481,3
50481,Little tight under the arms and sheer when sunlight hits it.,50481,3
50482,haven't tried it yet but looks nice and true to the picture.,50482,3
50483,Shirt was sewn very unevenly.,50483,3
50483,I ended up giving it away.,50483,3
50484,Somewhat tight in the arms.,50484,3
50484,"About knee length on me (I'm 5-5), Material is thin.",50484,3
50484,Looks more like a nightgown.,50484,3
50484,I won't be wearing this in public,50484,3
50485,"I know I bought a medium, but I did not expect to be alittle smaller",50485,3
50486,"Went by the chart of measurements and the size was quite a bit off, not going to be able to zip it up at all",50486,3
50487,The necklace I received is not the same one as pictured.,50487,3
50487,A bit disappointed as this is a gift.,50487,3
50488,Runs a little smsll,50488,3
50489,The wallet I received wasn't as vibrant a color as the one advertised.,50489,3
50489,The front of it above the ID slot is a faded brown color as well (see pictures).,50489,3
50489,"Besides the disappointing color, the wallet was a good purchase.",50489,3
50490,This veil was okay.,50490,3
50490,I eventually purchased another one that is much softer.,50490,3
50490,This veil is your typical stiff tulle.,50490,3
50490,It doesn't have a lot of movement to it.,50490,3
50490,If you are looking for a cheap tulle veil this is definitely it.,50490,3
50490,The comb is great at holding the veil in your hair.,50490,3
50491,I am a size 12.,50491,3
50491,The body of the costume was super stretchy and loose it was comfy but it didn't look as cute as I wanted it too.,50491,3
50492,loved the shirt but a large fits like a small,50492,3
50493,"This is Kalvin's girlfriend, just in case that was confusing to anyone :P

I wear a 32G.",50493,3
50493,"Small rib cage, large bust.",50493,3
50493,"Looking at the size chart, I decided to order a large based on the difference between my measurements.",50493,3
50493,"However, the sports bra barely gripped by ribs, and the straps were too long.",50493,3
50493,The bus portion was alright.,50493,3
50493,Clearly this would fit a girl with more equal proportions!,50493,3
50493,"Just putting this review for my petite, but busty, girls out there.",50493,3
50494,Pretty short compared to other shirts this size.,50494,3
50495,The bottoms fit small but the top fits to large.,50495,3
50497,Nice soft fabric if somewhat thin.,50497,3
50497,Very long and little too big.,50497,3
50498,"Nice looking dress but did not fit, the chest area has no stretch with the sequined band
I ordered a size up also",50498,3
50499,"I am 5'6 and weigh 147, I bought a Medium but it ended up being to small, Re-ordered a large., that fit way better!",50499,3
50501,REALLY tight on the waist.,50501,3
50501,wider in the hips and cinches at the waistband.,50501,3
50502,"So due to asian sizes I needed a 3 XL to fit my bust based on the measurement they provided,  and it was way too big for me.",50502,3
50502,"I usually wear a medium in tanks, sometimes a large.",50502,3
50502,I don't think this would fit a 3XL American.,50502,3
50502,Good quality cute style wish it fit,50502,3
50503,"The Coat is cool, but the sizes are not the typical American sizes.",50503,3
50503,"I ordered a Medium and the coat barely fits me, too tight; for everything else I use medium and thing fit fine on me ( coats, jackets, shirts, t-shirts, sweaters, etc.",50503,3
50503,Perhaps these sizes they use are for the European market.,50503,3
50503,"I still have some concerns on the ""fine details of the coat""; a friend of mine is using it; he's smaller than me; we'll see if anything goes wrong.",50503,3
50504,So I love the dress.,50504,3
50504,"But when I got it, it was covered in deodorant under the armpits.",50504,3
50504,They could have at least washed it before sending it back out to someone.,50504,3
50504,I liked it enough to wash it and keep it.,50504,3
50504,Just disappointed and a little grossed out.,50504,3
50505,"A little smaller than expected, and check the punctuation!",50505,3
50506,It's ok nothing special.,50506,3
50506,Good for summer and not too expensive,50506,3
50507,Order a little larger than your actual size.,50507,3
50507,I'm 5'5 and 118 lbs and I ordered a medium.,50507,3
50507,"Granted they don't sell the version I got anymore (Asuna Blue ALO) but the arm bands were way too small and it was REALLY tight on the butt, chest, and stomach.",50507,3
50507,If you want the best of the best I would look elsewhere but this is a little less than its worth,50507,3
50508,Its cute but matieral was thin i was looking for more of a thicker stretchy mayerial.,50508,3
50508,other then that the outfit is cute although I won't be wearing it for my bday I will wear it some time during summer.,50508,3
50509,"I LOVE the cut and design of this dress, but it just didn't fit.",50509,3
50509,(I was pretty devastated.,50509,3
50509,I still mourn what could have been.),50509,3
50509,"I'm generally a size 12 - 14 with a 36DDD chest- the Large baaaaarely zipped and featured a Boobpocalypse up front, and the XL flared out a lot right beneath the breasts and made my stomach look really poochy.",50509,3
50509,"I think it's a great dress, it's just not the cut for my body.",50509,3
50510,I wear a lot of suits and this works great under the suits.,50510,3
50510,It is cut a bit small but okay since it's hidden.,50510,3
50511,They ran a size too small.,50511,3
50516,Hell first it was to small and it wasn't the color i wanted .,50516,3
50518,product quality was good...but the waist was too small for me.,50518,3
50519,Quality is not that great and the pants are super longs,50519,3
50520,"The shirt was ok for this price, the only thing is that it comes 2 zises smaller",50520,3
50521,"Product description was mixed colors, but I mistakenly thought I was ordering black, because the picture was erroneously black.",50521,3
50521,"I could have returned them for a full refund, but didn't want the hassle.",50521,3
50521,Maybe next time I will go to a local retailer and avoid possible misunderstandings.,50521,3
50521,Otherwise the style and quality was as expected.,50521,3
50522,Very sexy but yes I'm 5'7 and a 34DD and not lacking in the caboose & very tight.,50522,3
50522,thank god for the straps!,50522,3
50523,The chest part didn't fit to good got a lot of side boob,50523,3
50524,"Nice shirt, the size is not accurate .",50524,3
50524,The large us size is not even reflect a small us size.,50524,3
50525,I ordered the red but it has an orange red look to it.,50525,3
50526,These are cute - nice and soft and the design is cute.,50526,3
50526,I bought the M/L size.,50526,3
50526,"When I tighten these on my 6-month old baby, the closure system part was too long for my baby.",50526,3
50526,"As a result, I had to worry if the excessive piece would scratch my baby's face or poke his eye.",50526,3
50526,I bought another set of mittens in conjunction with this one for a much cheaper price (Safety 1st) and actually liked those much better.,50526,3
50526,I'll keep using both but probably will limit using these until my son is a little bigger and the closure system fits him better.,50526,3
50526,"My baby is 6 months and 16 pounds 10 ounces, if that gives any idea how big these are.",50526,3
50526,I bought the M/L based on other reviews.,50526,3
50526,The actual mitten part fits nicely for my son's hands; it's just the clasp closure part that is too big.,50526,3
50527,Nice color a tad tight especially at hem.,50527,3
50528,tight in the chest for a large on me.,50528,3
50528,I am about a 44-45 chest.,50528,3
50529,"Its very cute, nice material but after looking at reviews I decided to order a size up, a medium because I'm normally a small, so I ordered the Asian size L and I did not get a medium I got a large, it was too big, mostly around the breast area is where it didn't fit, it was too big.",50529,3
50530,This swim diaper was very cute.,50530,3
50530,My daughter was not able to wear it very long though because of the size.,50530,3
50530,"It kept everything in, but was tight at the thighs.",50530,3
50530,It did not seem to bother her in the pool but I felt bad after I took it off and she had red thighs where it was rubbing.,50530,3
50532,I am very busty so tight in bust.,50532,3
50533,Very cute and lightweight,50533,3
50534,Nice but the color advertised is darker than the lime green that arrived.,50534,3
50535,It's nice but you can see through it.,50535,3
50536,Sized small....not American sizes.,50536,3
50536,My young niece got an unplanned gift.,50536,3
50537,"Not as expected
Gave to goodwill",50537,3
50538,Not the best but ok I guess.,50538,3
50538,They're rubber and not hard plastic.,50538,3
50538,I wouldn't buy them again,50538,3
50539,Plastic quality isn't bad but it isn't amazing either.,50539,3
50539,A chip or two in the paint in the plastic.,50539,3
50539,The bag that comes with it is good quality.,50539,3
50540,"Much brighter color than in the picture, so Im not that thrilled about it.",50540,3
50540,"Shirt is stretchy, comfy, and fitted.",50540,3
50541,"It's cute, but I don't like the material itself - just too sticky / HOT for a body wrap after being in water.",50541,3
50542,"Hat a little larger than expected, but quality is good.",50542,3
50543,I do love this; it broke already.,50543,3
50544,material is nice but it was a bit bigger than expected,50544,3
50545,Strap was to loose fitting..,50545,3
50545,It feels as if I cannot make it any tighter without making another hole so that my feet don't slide,50545,3
50546,"It is a skirt only in the front, just panties in back.",50546,3
50547,"looks okay, its very low quality but dose keep your head warm during the cold weather.",50547,3
50547,and it has a zipper pocket and mittens with you see the paw prints for your hands.,50547,3
50547,it dose loose some of the fur when you first get it then it stops.,50547,3
50547,if your on a budget for your kids this okay.,50547,3
50548,"NOt as pretty as picture,",50548,3
50549,Fit like a large.,50549,3
50549,Was absolutely beautiful otherwise!,50549,3
50550,I oderdd this dress for my brothers wedding and am on time constraints.,50550,3
50550,I asked to have this dress custom made and sent measurments.,50550,3
50550,The dress I received is not those.,50550,3
50550,"I asked for a 14"" long top corset part, and the longest part is 10"".",50550,3
50550,"This dress is too large by about 1"" around the waist and did not come with a lace up back as the photo shows, but a zipper instead.",50550,3
50550,I don't mind the zipper if the dress fit.,50550,3
50550,"Once I tighten the built in bra it feels better, but then there is an open space where the dress sticks off my back.",50550,3
50550,"The dress quality seems alright and it is comfortable, but I am dissatisfied  with the ""custom made sizing"" and now do not have time to have it redone and sent again from China.",50550,3
50550,If you order this dress be VERY specific and allow plenty of time in case alterations must be made.,50550,3
50551,"As good as expected, color was more of a straight orange rather than a peachy color.",50551,3
50551,"Not the buckle clip like triangl , a little different.",50551,3
50551,Straps come off easy after a handful of uses and the elastic on the bottoms are tight for someone with bigger hips and thighs like me,50551,3
50552,The dress fit well around but was way too short,50552,3
50553,Fit is smaller and shorter than expected.,50553,3
50553,I have several other dresses from this maker that fit differently.,50553,3
50554,"I didn't realize when I bought this bag, the number of pot leaf tongue rings I was purchasing.",50554,3
50554,"I've got nothing against anyone who wants to partake, but I personally refrain from such use.",50554,3
50554,"I can't lie though, there are a few cute rings amists the marajuana memorabilia",50554,3
50555,"Far too small for me, I could fit my size 16 into it okay, but not comfortably.",50555,3
50555,"I gave it to my sister who is also a huge GoT fan, so it all worked out.",50555,3
50556,Very nice shirt except you have to keep pulling it down in back.,50556,3
50557,I love my waist trainer for the zip up option but the hooks aren't very sturdy.,50557,3
50557,I popped the bottom two hooks trying the trainer on for the first time.,50557,3
50557,They popped with very little resistance.,50557,3
50557,The two additional hooks at the top are good and the fact that it is still firm when it zips works just fine.,50557,3
50557,I've seen a significant difference in my waist in just a weeks time.,50557,3
50558,Comfortable fit fit a little bit large you have to wear a shirt under it because it is very sheer but for the price it's overall a good shirt.,50558,3
50559,Bought wrong ones but fell inlove.,50559,3
50559,Get compliments all the time,50559,3
50560,Love it It's just too small,50560,3
50561,"Pretty and nicely lined, but little white frays come off easily.",50561,3
50562,Still looked cute but was to big!,50562,3
50562,I'm 5'2 138lbs with double DDs so it fit perfect up top but was drowning in the waste,50562,3
50563,I ordered the wrong size by mistake.,50563,3
50563,I use it as a pullover.,50563,3
50564,"a little thinner than expected, but as long as the undergarments are appropriate it's fine!",50564,3
50565,"Pretty decent jacket, great for visibility and blocks wind quite well.",50565,3
50565,"Sleeves fit my 38 inch arms perfectly and for my 6'8"" frame the torso is adequately long.",50565,3
50565,Only problem is that it soaks up sweat in the lining and takes a considerable time to dry out.,50565,3
50566,"The top was ok but the bottom was so little, that I couldn't use it.",50566,3
50566,"It was like a size small, and not large, as I ordered.",50566,3
50567,Love the fit & feel of this top.,50567,3
50567,"It's soft, but wrinkles easily.",50567,3
50567,I originally purchased it in green and loved it so much I reordered a royal blue one.,50567,3
50567,When it arrived it was more purple than blue.,50567,3
50567,"I bought it to match with a skirt that has a royal blue design, so the purple doesn't go with it.",50567,3
50567,BUT I will keep it because I like the color and fit - I'll just have to find another top to go with my skirt.,50567,3
50568,I don't know what you want me to say.,50568,3
50568,They were mens size and too big.,50568,3
50568,I am just wearing them around the house.,50568,3
50569,"sizing is not generous, but shirt is ok, very thin.",50569,3
50570,The smaller jacket we purchased fit the intended wearer okay.,50570,3
50570,"However, on both jackets the sleeves pull up too far whenever the arms are lifted as in driving or just reaching and one jacket was returned - actually donated to a local charity since there was a $7.50 charge for returns.",50570,3
50570,We did order another jacket in a larger size and had the same problem off it goes too.,50570,3
50570,"Anyway, maybe it is a personal preference about the sleeves I do not like sleeves on coats that pull up well past my wrist.",50570,3
50570,On a positive note the two tops we bought fit wonderfully and on a couple of washes are holding their shape and color.,50570,3
50570,The tops are very soft and comfortable and while I still find the sleeves a little short on tops it isn't so important to me because they can just be pushed up.,50570,3
50571,"The item is very nice looking, but it didn't last more than one school year before the zipper broke.",50571,3
50571,Would have been nice if it lasted at least 2 or 3 school years.,50571,3
50572,"I like it but it's too small,I'm hoping I'll continue to loose weight and get to wear it soon.",50572,3
50573,The subject matter is very cool.,50573,3
50573,The colors are nice and bright and images are good and clear.,50573,3
50573,The price was also fair.,50573,3
50573,Even if the sizes were all different from one pair to another.,50573,3
50573,They seem to run small but 2 of the pairs were really much smaller than the others.,50573,3
50573,"They are ok quality, not great but not wal mart.",50573,3
50573,They took close to 3 weeks to arrive.,50573,3
50574,wasn't look I was going for ;),50574,3
50575,Can see thru the front.,50575,3
50575,Have to wear a tank under it,50575,3
50576,"To big no use for it,",50576,3
50580,More a pajama than a pant.,50580,3
50580,Comfortable to be used for house wear.,50580,3
50581,It feels like there is a big lump of something under my arch.,50581,3
50581,It is hard to get used to it having that big lump feeling.,50581,3
50581,I am searching for an alternate.,50581,3
50582,"These are not the most comfortable pair of underwear, especially given there price.",50582,3
50582,"I would suggest getting the ""3six five"" or ""24-seven"" pairs from SAXX instead.",50582,3
50582,They are much more comfortable and a little cheaper prices.,50582,3
50583,"So when I eventually got this necklace, the back clasp was completely stuck together.",50583,3
50583,I had to bust it open (which took awhile).,50583,3
50583,It's a cute necklace though.,50583,3
50584,The dress us a little small and does NOT have the flared skirt as shown in the photi!,50584,3
50584,A crinoline petticoat does not fit under the dress at all!,50584,3
50585,It's a great shaped shirt and the fabric hung nicely hiding unsightly lumps and bumps.,50585,3
50585,"But after one wash it vaca me a belly shirt, only shrunk shorter but seems wider and looser in a way.",50585,3
50585,Fabric seems it was cut the wrong way,50585,3
50586,I'm a very curvy 36FF.,50586,3
50586,It fits as expected but shorter than I imagined.,50586,3
50586,"A little stretch in the fabric and a beautiful, vibrant color.",50586,3
50586,"Will not purchase more, but I won't return.",50586,3
50587,too small in the chest area.,50587,3
50587,"good for 12 year old girls, likely",50587,3
50588,I purchase this product to wear under a bridesmaids dress.,50588,3
50588,It was adorable but it ran quite small.,50588,3
50588,I ended up giving it to the bride since it was to short for me.,50588,3
50588,I ordered the Medium as and it came just below my butt cheeks.,50588,3
50588,"I am about 5'9"".",50588,3
50589,"This belt is ok for the price, but definitely not the best quality.",50589,3
50589,I'm a size 28 waist and the medium is pretty big on me and gaps in the back.,50589,3
50589,The material is a sort of microfiber.,50589,3
50589,You will also need to wear it with breeches that have wide belt loops.,50589,3
50590,"I love the pattern, so I will definitely wear them, and they fit, though I have long legs so the small is short on my ankle.",50590,3
50590,"The pattern on one leg is sewn kinda over lapped in the back and there were a couple small threads loose, it's China made but you get what you pay for.",50590,3
50590,"It also arrived with the packaging partly open, so you could see what was in the package.",50590,3
50591,Cute Shorts which are billowy with a tight elastic waist.,50591,3
50591,Good for small waisted pair shapes.,50591,3
50591,Bad for straight up and down .,50591,3
50591,I'm taking a chunk out of the elastic fit a better fit.,50591,3
50591,Top is only good as a shelf bra.,50591,3
50591,The arm bands are just tight cuffs.,50591,3
50592,"I guess it's okay for the summer, but nothing to write home about.",50592,3
50592,Cheap is cheap and for a reason!,50592,3
50594,"Like them awesome but way to small and I ordered up 2 sizes so careful, I'm also a xl usually",50594,3
50595,A few washes & it pretty much fell apart.,50595,3
50595,But - yes super-cute,50595,3
50596,"Love the shirt however, runs short.",50596,3
50596,Looks fine with another black tank top underneath,50596,3
50597,I like the option of using either the red stud or the jacket for the 2 red ball set.,50597,3
50597,Only downside is that the earring back is a little loose so they are not that secure.,50597,3
50597,I squeezed the back to make it tighter but it just made it toughwrong to get off.,50597,3
50597,"Unlike an earring jacket there is only one hole option so if you have uneven earring holes in your lobes, one earring could have a larger gap from the bottom of the lobe to the bottom of the gold dip.",50597,3
50597,Still worth the price and I will use them again.,50597,3
50598,I ordered a size small and received a size medium.,50598,3
50598,I really like the quality of the shirt although it is not my size which is a problem...,50598,3
50599,I do like the wrap bangle bar but it turned colors with in a day in a half I wasn't happy about that,50599,3
50600,"Its really short and the bigger the size is, it doesn't get any longer.",50600,3
50600,"I have a bubble butt, so width doesn't help length, its super stretchy, but it runs a little bit small.",50600,3
50601,Went next size up love the bloomers no doubt about it under dresses that are a little short,50601,3
50602,"The shirt is alright, pretty true to size and flattering enough, overall.",50602,3
50602,"I gave it 3 stars because I ordered the white color however, received it with stains!!",50602,3
50602,Would have given it 2 stars for that reason alone.,50602,3
50602,"The fabric is alright, soft enough but does feel a bitt roughish.",50602,3
50602,"There is some flow to this shirt however, it is quite close to the body.",50602,3
50602,So if you've got a belly like myself...It isn't exactly the best flow or the most flattering.,50602,3
50602,"If the company is willing to be fair, I'll be trying to get this shirt exchanged for a NON STAINED one.",50602,3
50602,"If they aren't interested in being fair, I'll likely be returning it.",50602,3
50603,"Nice shoes, but not if you have to be on your feet.",50603,3
50603,I sit at a desk most of the day.,50603,3
50603,"Once again, need to offer more colors!!",50603,3
50604,"A decent long T-shirt, but this could never be a dress in anyone.",50604,3
50605,"I mean it was only $2 so you can't expect Claire's quality jewelry...still, it's better than I was expecting for the most part.",50605,3
50605,It doesn't feel like leather and looks more like shiny cheap plastic-y pleather.,50605,3
50605,The charms are lightweight.,50605,3
50605,"The only annoying thing is the clasp which is really big and leaves a big gap even on the tightest link, so the charms side kept slipping to the inside of my wrist.",50605,3
50605,I ended up having to tie a little white thread around the clasps to tighten the bracelet but it still kept slipping so you'll have to keep readjusting the bracelet throughout the day and I don't think it would last very long with that much handling.,50605,3
50605,But it looks cool and expensive from far away so if you need costume jewelry or just something for a one day outfit then this would be a good investment....buuuut it did take a month to ship so there's that too.,50605,3
50606,"The Dials barely work,  the 2nd hand keeps stopping,  the winder fell out and I had to spend 30 minutes putting it back on.",50606,3
50606,The Watch looks really nice but the only thing that functions well is the digital time.,50606,3
50607,I ordered a large based on the description and the size guide and found the item way to big.,50607,3
50607,I usually wear a size small but based on the recommendations ordered a large.,50607,3
50608,"This is a pretty dress with simple lines, unfortunately it was too small for me across my shoulders and at the arm holes.",50608,3
50608,The color is also much more green and bright than the pale muted turquoise-blue that's pictured.,50608,3
50608,It's a big enough difference to not be a monitor setting problem.,50608,3
50608,I'm sending it back for a refund since it just won't be able to serve it's purpose for me.,50608,3
50609,Cheap quality but looks okay.,50609,3
50610,Material not as thick as I thought... good thing I went a size up...,50610,3
50610,I'm size small but prefer a loose fit so I order a size up... Got a Large on this and it fits well... material is clingy so it falls nicely plus I got a good length on the torso fit.,50610,3
50610,Would have likes it more if the materials were a bit heavier.,50610,3
50611,The bottoms were big enough for 2 of me.,50611,3
50611,And the top runs a bit big.,50611,3
50612,"colors are good, fabric is cheap, sewing is poor, would not order again",50612,3
50613,Not very happy with this piece.,50613,3
50613,Looks cheap and a few of the stones had come out of the setting.,50613,3
50614,Sizing chart is not correct.,50614,3
50615,"Ok so first thing was when I opened the package this dress had an absolutely horrible smell, I mean horrible.",50615,3
50615,Had to immediately place back in bag to get away from the smell.,50615,3
50615,After some consideration I decided to wash this dress right away and see if smell resolved.,50615,3
50615,After washing product twice smell has resolved and I was able to try dress on.,50615,3
50615,Material is stretchy and thin.,50615,3
50615,Will need to wear some shapewear under to prevent appearance of unpleasant lines and bulges.,50615,3
50615,Overall nice appearing dress if you can get past the initial smell of the fabric.,50615,3
50616,Nice belt but loops  are bigger width than the belt itself,50616,3
50617,Fits true to size except in the shoulder/arm area.,50617,3
50617,Bought for working out but doesn't allow enough arm movement room so will be using for other things.,50617,3
50618,The chain and locket is VERY cheap.,50618,3
50618,It falls off all the time and your going to have to be prepared to make some adjustments to it.,50618,3
50618,"It's still cute, but alot of trouble.",50618,3
50618,"It looks exactly like the one in the picture though, which i was happy about.",50618,3
50618,Its a very cheap metal though so buyer beware.,50618,3
50618,I wouldnt reccomend buying this without a pair of plyers to fix them as well.,50618,3
50619,"These are nice and they do they job, but they are a bit flimsy.",50619,3
50619,The first one broke after only about a month.,50619,3
50619,Thankfully there were a couple of extras in the package and I swapped the broken one out.,50619,3
50620,"Returned because the product specs said the belt measured 47""...  No!",50620,3
50620,"It actually measured 37"",from buckle to tip",50620,3
50621,I typically wear a small in workout tops and ordered the small/medium in this.,50621,3
50621,"It's cute up top and I liked the built-in-bra, but it was way too tight in the hips and waist.",50621,3
50621,I usually don't have that problem.,50621,3
50621,"If I ordered the larger size, the top wouldn't fit because I have a small chest.",50621,3
50623,I think that it fit a little smaller than expected.,50623,3
50624,The straps are way too far apart.,50624,3
50624,They cut into the sides of my back and the straps always wanted to fall down.,50624,3
50625,"Love the cape, really pretty but I have to wear as a jacket when the weather is cool.",50625,3
50625,"It's not the size I expected, if ordering go to sizes up if you're purchasing for wearing like a coat.",50625,3
50626,"It is gorgeous, but I ordered the large and it will probably only fit size 4/6 maybe an 8...I purchased this for a maternity client and it definitely will not fit.",50626,3
50627,"The gloves are very comfortable, but they are not as warm as I thought they would be from the information put forth in the description of the gloves.",50627,3
50627,"I use them during snow blowing, I live in the Oregon Cascades where we get a lot of snow that has to be  moved.",50627,3
50627,Within an hour my fingers are just as cold as with other gloves that cost less than half .,50627,3
50628,"shorts fit ok, top was too small.",50628,3
50628,the section in the back sat up too high on my back.,50628,3
50629,The clip broke the first time i wore it.,50629,3
50629,Received lots of compliments on it.,50629,3
50630,A lot of repeats and ugly guy looking tongue rings.,50630,3
50631,Hat is listed as one size...hats are not simply one size.,50631,3
50631,This fits the top of ur skull...doesn't come down to the ears like an average hat.,50631,3
50631,If u are buying for an adult make sure they have a child sized head!,50631,3
50632,I don't understand why the lace just hangs off on the arm part- looks unfinished- like i need to sew it onto the arms.,50632,3
50632,Super not happy about that.,50632,3
50633,I'm not quite sure how to rate this coin purse.,50633,3
50633,The quality and colors were as expected based on my previous Vera Bradley purchases.,50633,3
50633,"However, even though the overall size is similar to my old Vera Bradley Double Kiss Coin Purse (the one with the mini Kiss coin purse inside), the frame on this one is too small and would only allow a couple of credit cards to be placed inside (the frame on the Double Kiss is rounded and extends further down the side of the bag).",50633,3
50633,"I could FORCE more cards in, but then they were nearly impossible to get back out.",50633,3
50633,Really just not useable to carry credit cards and loyalty cards.,50633,3
50633,"Though to be fair, it doesn't really state in the description that it's intended use was for credit cards; I just assumed they'd fit based on the overall size and similarity to my old Double Kiss Coin Purse.",50633,3
50634,Kind of dissapointed at how the wolf doesn't really look like a wolf.,50634,3
50634,"I thought of all the wolf onesies I found on amazon, this one looked most like a wolf but when i got it, it looked like some messed up cartoon character wolf.",50634,3
50634,A little dissapointed because it's a gift for my boyfriend who loves wolves but I guess it will just have to do.,50634,3
50634,Hope he likes it regardless.,50634,3
50635,"For taller people (6 foot 1/2 or above), the length is a little bothersome.",50635,3
50635,"For the price, didn't expect the greatest quality but definitely seems like some alignment of the pattern is off.",50635,3
50635,Still a cute dress.,50635,3
50636,"It is okay, thin, tight fitting for me (most smalls fit me fine, i am 5'4"" 127 lb), doesn't feel that cashmere feeling very much--i would recommend ordering  a size up if you want it to look like picture.",50636,3
50637,"I LOOKED WONDERFUL IN THIS ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE SNAPS KEPT COMING APART SO I HAD TO USE A SAFETY PIN, WHICH WASN'T A GOOD IDEA BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.",50637,3
50638,We had these shoes last year and were great for spray park and beach.,50638,3
50638,We ordered these in blue this year and wore them at the beach and worked well.,50638,3
50638,We bought a second pair in green to send to daycare for sprinkler play.,50638,3
50638,Both pairs say size 9m and when held up to a size 8.5 stride rite sneaker the blue ones are about the same size.,50638,3
50638,The green ones are huge and say size 9 but are about 1-2 sizes larger.,50638,3
50639,"I like the color, design, material and specially the price.",50639,3
50639,The only down is that the rings are not aligned.,50639,3
50640,"I ordered 3T for my daughter, who just turned 2.",50640,3
50640,"The shirt fits great, she'll be able to wear it for a while.",50640,3
50640,The skirt is very tight on the waist...fits like it is 12 or 18 month size,50640,3
50641,"I don't think this product will do everything it promises, but it's an ok alternative.",50641,3
50642,"I ordered my bag October 8th, shipped October 10th and got it today on November 7th.",50642,3
50642,For someone who is used to amazon prime shipping this was pretty annoying but you're told upfront it could possibly take this long so I can't really complain.,50642,3
50642,"The bag arrived in a plastic bag, which I would have preferred a box to prevent the bag from getting smushed by other packages.",50642,3
50642,The bag did have a slight smell but went away quickly.,50642,3
50642,"It's not as structured as a true celine bag, but it still stands on its own.",50642,3
50642,"It's a decent sized bag, not too big not too small.",50642,3
50642,"It looks slightly shiny but not glossy shiny, the textured look of the bag gives off that apperwance in flash photography but otherwise looks matte for the most part.",50642,3
50642,"If you're looking for a fake celine bag and refuse to pay over $2000 like I do, this bag is a great alternative.",50642,3
50643,But I would not have gone bigger.,50643,3
50644,"Sort of fell apart, but it was cheap in cost, so...you get what you pay for?",50644,3
50644,Easy to reassemble and cute.,50644,3
50645,It's a bit pricy for its quality.,50645,3
50645,"I expected the hat would be more plushy, however this is very light material.",50645,3
50645,It was ok I guess and fits good.,50645,3
50645,"I did not try the candles, though..",50645,3
50646,This is tighter than other vests I have bought from the same label at the same size.,50646,3
50647,the button broke off after 2 weeks,50647,3
50648,"It is a lot larger than what the size represents... it's ok ..in about a week, went thru all hook sizes now it's to big.",50648,3
50649,The shirt is shorter in length than expected which makes it fit a little more widely across the top.,50649,3
50651,The center part chipped..,50651,3
50651,So I stopped using them (chipped like two weeks after I got them) .,50651,3
50651,Then I got robbed (left my car unlocked).,50651,3
50651,They also took the poptart I had in there.,50651,3
50652,I really like the style and shape of these sunglasses and they fit well over my prescription glasses.,50652,3
50652,"However, after less than a year, the surface of the ear pieces and the the nose is starting to flake off.",50652,3
50653,"yes, they were somewhat (my fault) but I personall like these jeggings.",50653,3
50654,Size not true to description,50654,3
50656,Pretty but runs small and narrow.,50656,3
50656,Order one size up or more if you like a tunic to flow or to work as a beach cover up.,50656,3
50657,Three words: buy extra chains.,50657,3
50657,"If you can replace the s***ty clasp and chain that connects it when you buy it (since those break, bend, and snap super easily), then its definitely worth the price.",50657,3
50657,"However mine came with the arrow and infinity sign correct ways up but the dragon itself was upside down, leaving the flat side top.",50657,3
50657,I can either have the dragon be normal or the arrow and infinity sign be normal.,50657,3
50657,I suggest finding one somewhere higher quality.,50657,3
50657,"It also chips the color away if you wear it in water, or so ive found.",50657,3
50658,Have to wear a tank underneath bc the top had barely any coverage which doesn't make sense since pregnant women usually need extra coverage and support in that area.,50658,3
50658,Hoping i can wear it after baby bc its a cute dress.,50658,3
50659,Works great as long as you are not wearing athletic shorts.,50659,3
50659,It slides off them easy.,50659,3
50660,The black dye comes off on my feet,50660,3
50661,Fragile but good look!,50661,3
50662,They are comfortable but the pouch is too small.,50662,3
50662,they feel great on my legs and do help keep you warm .,50662,3
50662,I cut the pouch out and use them daily.,50662,3
50662,I  ordered a 2nd pair the same size and they are smaller than the first,50662,3
50663,Pretty good fit for the most part.,50663,3
50663,However it's a littl too short.,50663,3
50663,Hits a little above the ankles.,50663,3
50664,I use it on my work bag that I don't care what it looks like.,50664,3
50664,I like the colors.,50664,3
50664,It differentiated my bag.,50664,3
50665,Quality shirt...love the printed image.,50665,3
50665,Not a standard large...too small.,50665,3
50666,"This is really pretty in the picture but when I received it I felt it to be ""over the top"" and a bit garish.",50666,3
50666,It is going to be that piece of jewelry that you want because it exactly matches something you already have so I have saved it till I find something summery to wear it with.,50666,3
50667,I started using this in my 2nd trimester.,50667,3
50667,I was about 137 to 138 lbs and I bought a size 2 in black.,50667,3
50667,I must say when it's folded over it does cover the top of my jeans successfully and no one could tell that I had it unbuttoned.,50667,3
50667,"However, I kept having to readjust through the whole afternoon.",50667,3
50667,"Since, I was working in my husband's store and had to bend down a lot to pick up things from the ground or bottom shelves the back of my jeans kept slipping and that was annoying.",50667,3
50667,I don't know if maybe I picked a size that was too big for me but I've only used this product twice since I bought it.,50667,3
50668,"The quality is very nice looking, it feels very sturdy, it was just too big.",50668,3
50668,"I am a size 3/4 in pants, I weight right now 130lbs, 5'5 and im a size 34B in bras (to give you an example of my chest width) and I got a small.",50668,3
50668,It wasn't even tight on the tightest hook.,50668,3
50668,"Taking it out of the package I knew it looked too big for me, I could comfortably fit my hand in it on the tightest hooks when I was wearing it.",50668,3
50668,I am going to return it for an XS and hopefully I will have a challenge getting it to fit on the loosest hook.,50668,3
50668,I gave it 3 stars only because it was too big and i have to exchange it.,50668,3
50670,Somewhat large in the top area but a nice dress overall.,50670,3
50670,Pretty comfortable and cool.,50670,3
50672,I expected something else none the less I liked it.,50672,3
50673,Ordered a large and it didn't fit.,50673,3
50673,It ripped on the side as soon as I put it on and I don't have a big bust.,50673,3
50674,Glass are nice; but frame is made of cheap material.,50674,3
50675,Exactly as pictures but if you have small face this no is for you !,50675,3
50675,Example for me is big but are nice Glasses,50675,3
50676,wore it a couple of times.,50676,3
50677,It is a little big but I will make a few alterations.,50677,3
50678,"Not true to size, order a size up.",50678,3
50678,"Good quality, just too small.",50678,3
50680,Wide through the shoulders,50680,3
50681,"Body weight: 125 lbs
Height: 5 feet 4 inches
Bust-Waist-Hip: 34-29-37
Body type: Athletic/Pear
Size purchased: X-Small

This dress is really cute and absolutely adorable, but it is very cheaply made.",50681,3
50681,Cheaper than anything I have personally bought from Forever 21.,50681,3
50681,The lace started to tear off the shoulder after a few washes in the washing machine.,50681,3
50681,"The top and bottom is shear, so I recommend you wear something under it.",50681,3
50681,The color isn't as pale as the picture is depicted by the seller.,50681,3
50681,Its a little more saturated color.,50681,3
50681,It does come with the belt.,50681,3
50681,I have worn the belt with other outfits.,50681,3
50681,The current price is a bit steep for what you get.,50681,3
50681,This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price.,50681,3
50681,I am reviewing it solely because to share my experience with other potential customers.,50681,3
50681,I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.,50681,3
50684,This swimsuit is very pretty and it is made out of good material.,50684,3
50684,I ordered a size 4XL because I usually take a size.,50684,3
50684,Im also busty and have broad shoulders.,50684,3
50684,I had some issues with how it fit.,50684,3
50684,"First, the bra part was too small for my chest.",50684,3
50684,"If I had the underwire positioned under my boobs, I was spilling over the top.",50684,3
50684,My second issue was with the bottom part.,50684,3
50684,It fits but it shows a lot of butt cheek.,50684,3
50684,Too much for me to feel comfortable in it.,50684,3
50685,A little baggy & fabric is a little shiny,50685,3
50686,Smaller than I thought and some of the words in the secret message came spelled wrong.,50686,3
50686,Like the word secret,50686,3
50687,It fitted a bit too small especially in the stomach area.,50687,3
50689,I love these...unfortunately they easily tear at the big toe.,50689,3
50689,Wore a pair once and came home with a hole in my toe.,50689,3
50689,Two pair have done this so far.,50689,3
50690,"not as cute in person, but ok.",50690,3
50691,Was ordered  but still too small other than that every thing else was good,50691,3
50692,"The fit is nice, but the bottom is definitely see through.",50692,3
50693,Very short in length,50693,3
50694,"This sweatshirt runs small, but is cozy, warm, and soft.",50694,3
50695,"Ok for casual wear, item seems to run smaller than expected, but not bad.",50695,3
50695,"Did not care for sleeves bunched up (not folded), will not wear for work.",50695,3
50696,This is a very nice wallet but with in less than 2 days use the emblem fell off,50696,3
50697,Order a size or two up!,50697,3
50697,It shrank horribly as well!,50697,3
50698,"The waist is fine, however, after washing the pants shrunk shorter.",50698,3
50699,cute but it sheds and smells kinda funny.,50699,3
50702,"Love the design, would have given 5 Stars....BUT, product description said ""sweatshirt"", i went back and read it several times and it does say sweatshirt, other than that,the entire experience was great, shipping and all.",50702,3
50702,"quick comment; concerning size, order a size up from what u normally do, and know that the waistband on this long sleeve T SHIRT is pretty small,the pic I took should accurately show how it hides under.",50702,3
50702,The SHIRT while wearing,50702,3
50704,"TOP PART OF THE SHIRT DOES FIT RIGHT, FALLS OFF THE SHOULDERS.",50704,3
50704,I GOT A SMALL,50704,3
50705,"The ruffled top just did not look at all as it does in the picture, this was not thedress for me.",50705,3
50706,"Fits well, looks fine.",50706,3
50707,I'll cut to the chase and then go into detail: the sizes are even smaller than listed.,50707,3
50707,I purchased the XXL because the sizing picture said that would be a US large.,50707,3
50707,The coat is at best a women's US large.,50707,3
50707,"For any normal sized NON-Asian male, this is a medium, and that's only if you wear a t-shirt under it.",50707,3
50707,Don't expect to wear anything bulky.,50707,3
50707,Here's whwt really irritwtes me: This company guarantees returns for anything EXCEPT size issues.,50707,3
50707,That indicates that they have had a lot of complaints and are avoiding returning people's money.,50707,3
50707,"If you want to pay for shipping to china, they'll let you.",50707,3
50707,These are the reasons for the 3 star review.,50707,3
50707,"It's a shame, because the item is very nice and the service was prompt.",50707,3
50707,But it's quite clear they have had complaints and just don't want to have to pay anyone back.,50707,3
50707,"Hoenstly, if they had an American XL (which would've been a large) I'd have paid to have it exchanged.",50707,3
50707,"If you are a very slim western male with no muscle mass and saggy shoulders, OR you are asian, this coat might fit you as described.",50707,3
50707,But don't waste your time otherwise.,50707,3
50708,This is not as listed at all.,50708,3
50708,"I wear a large, I ordered an xl as a safeguard, it was very tight and fit much like a woman's baby doll top, very tight on the arms and neck.",50708,3
50708,I ended cutting it up the sides and top and adding slytherin fabric and lacing.,50708,3
50709,It's beautiful and it recieves lots of compliments.,50709,3
50709,The only trouble is the wires are a bit finicky and get snagged on stuff easily.,50709,3
50709,"I fixed this with some pliers, I just bent the wires that stuck out in, and now it's lovely.",50709,3
50710,The straps that crisscross are not integral to the front panels.,50710,3
50710,They are scraps of material that lay on top.,50710,3
50710,This would be fine if they didn't get all curled or hang loose.,50710,3
50711,tooth fell out on first use.,50711,3
50712,I brought 2 of these for my husband and me.,50712,3
50712,They hold both of our cell phones but not for long especially if we move the phones in anyway it falls from the vent.,50712,3
50713,Runs a bit smaller than expected.,50713,3
50714,the little plastic part at the bottom came off the first time i wore them.,50714,3
50714,Not too happy about that but I like the boots so i will have the heel fixed.,50714,3
50714,Also they smell like chemicals so I hate the way they smell.,50714,3
50714,Still haven't aired out fully,50714,3
50715,Had a small whole in it as well!,50715,3
50715,But a cute dress,50715,3
50716,Good for non-aerobic workout.,50716,3
50716,Mesh was very comfortable but no support for lateral movrment.,50716,3
50717,The skirt fitted perfect however the top was too small,50717,3
50718,"Very loose (even more than I wanted) but it is a bathing suit cover up for me, so it is okay.",50718,3
50718,"If that is what you are looking for, it is comfortable and attractive.",50718,3
50719,I'm a size 6 so I bought the medium and it was too small.,50719,3
50720,The overall fit of the tank top was good - but the built-in shelf bra was small.,50720,3
50720,"I'll keep the top, but if you have large boobs, I wouldn't suggest this top.",50720,3
50720,The bra barely reaches down under my boobs - I'm a size C.,50720,3
50721,"I bought these for myself after reading the reviews, Im 5'2"" with a petite frame and I figured these would work for me since Women's sunglasses typically still look big on me but when I got them in they were way too small for even me.",50721,3
50721,I had to return them!,50721,3
50721,Definitely would work for my kiddos but they don't need Ray Bans!,50721,3
50722,Just a bit tight,50722,3
50723,In theory this shirt is gorgeous and I was excited to receive it.,50723,3
50723,"In wearing, the crochet doesn't lay nicely (I suppose if you wanted to iron it it might?",50723,3
50723,I didn't try that) AND it has a lampshade cut that you can't see in the pictures.,50723,3
50723,Unless you are really trying to hide a belly a straight cut would look nicer.,50723,3
50723,Fabric is good though.,50723,3
50723,"Sent mine back, it didn't work for me.",50723,3
50724,"I absolutely loved swim suit but was to small in chest  and back area, was going to order a xl but size not offered.",50724,3
50724,I'm usually a med to large .38d..so was disappointed that swim suit did not fit I'm a Large but overall really loved swim suit,50724,3
50725,"I am still trying to figure out how I would ever choose to buy anything, especially underwear, that is ""one size.""",50725,3
50725,I must have had Christmas brain & didn't catch that.,50725,3
50725,I prefer this area of my body to breathe!!,50725,3
50725,That's why I usually love this style & buy at Target/department stores.,50725,3
50725,"This lace style isn't like an elastic band around your waist or between your legs, it's usually soft & stretchy, but stays up perfect.",50725,3
50725,"If you are a definite medium will always fit shopper, go for it!",50725,3
50725,"If you are in the size range given, but a lot of the times you do choose up for comfort I would advise against purchasing anything that says ""one size.""",50725,3
50725,I always buy large bc every brand is different & I never want to experience the trauma of inner thigh restriction like little kid elastic band underwear!!!,50725,3
50725,"This is just my opinion, but even if they are a little big on you, this style doesn't fall down.",50725,3
50725,I was hoping to put a stop to digging through the never ending bins of thongs looking for #1 the color/style you like & #2 checking for your size once you've located #1.,50725,3
50726,This shirt came in today and I have to admit my expectations were slightly let down.,50726,3
50726,"I had purchased a medium, according to the size chart, but when I tried it on, the shirt was somewhat small.",50726,3
50726,And I think that's because the size chart is off.,50726,3
50726,Do not go by the size chart if you want the shirt to fit properly with a loose and  comfy fit.,50726,3
50726,"If you were to buy this product, I advise you to get maybe one or two sizes bigger than your normal size for proper fit.",50726,3
50726,The design however was excellent aside from one blemish in which one of the gold buttons was not glued properly.,50726,3
50726,I ordered the Vernon shirt and the design was exactly right according to the picture.,50726,3
50728,I loved the Dress.,50728,3
50728,Good color and very cute shape.,50728,3
50728,But I was too short.,50728,3
50728,"I am 5'5"" and I couldn't wear it without tights underneath.",50728,3
50728,It looked more like a blouse than a dress.,50728,3
50728,If you are short it may just work for you.,50728,3
50729,My daughter is 3 and after a wash these were far too slim fitting.,50729,3
50729,I bought 4/5 and she just turned 3.,50729,3
50730,"This is cute but I bought it bigger and it is still small
I wound up buying a pair of leggings and using as a shirt instead of a dress

I would not recommend this dress unless your child is skinny and small.",50730,3
50730,The top is not very stretchy.,50730,3
50730,The material is rather stiff.,50730,3
50730,The pattern is cute but it is more of a shirt not a dress as it is suppose to be used for.,50730,3
50730,Also the material is rather thin so it won't be very warm when used in winter months when it is normally cold out.,50730,3
50731,Much nicer fits perfect I'd like more in different colors and patterns,50731,3
50732,Was very pretty but tangles along,50732,3
50733,"A decent casual bag (rough canvas, slightly distressed).",50733,3
50733,The way you shot the picture of the inside of this bag it looks like it might have three separate inside sections but instead it has just one.,50733,3
50733,"And since your description is not very thorough, your customers have to just guess about some of the features.",50733,3
50733,"Also, it is quite odd that there is a flap one of the outside pockets, but it is for decoration only and there is no pocket directly underneath this flap.",50733,3
50734,I like the shirt except I got shipped a medium instead of a small.,50734,3
50734,I was expecting it to fit like a glove but got it on and chuckled because it was too big for me.,50734,3
50734,It was then I realized the tag said medium instead of small.,50734,3
50734,So if you are 5'7 and 140-147lbs medium maybe too big unless you like a loose fit.,50734,3
50734,No worries though I am about to shrink it on a pot of water then throw it in the dryer.,50734,3
50734,If that fails to the sewing machine it goes.,50734,3
50735,"Fine costume, but pretty cheap material",50735,3
50736,XL in another country is not XL in US,50736,3
50737,The sweatshirt had a hole when it arrived.,50737,3
50737,My son was too eager to wear it to send it back for a replacement.,50737,3
50739,Not like the Havaianas I see at the stores.,50739,3
50739,Look a bit cheap.,50739,3
50739,They do pinch in the front.,50739,3
50739,But for the price I'll keep them and use them around the house.,50739,3
50740,It was ok..but not what i expected!,50740,3
50741,"Love the top piece, however the bottom portion looks a little cheap...the material and the way it fits.",50741,3
50741,I am considering getting the bottom chopped off and adding a different material to it.,50741,3
50743,"Took forever to get that was pretty much the only drawback but, good product for the price.",50743,3
50744,The size was too large for my 13 year old.,50744,3
50744,I will need to see if I can return it.,50744,3
50744,Otherwise they are real nice sports bras.,50744,3
50745,They didn't last long.,50745,3
50745,but started to chip and fade pretty quick.,50745,3
50745,had sharp edges I had to file down just to be able to wear it.,50745,3
50746,Will go well with my steampunk outfit,50746,3
50747,These are very cute but I've ordered glasses from sojos before and they were much more sturdy than these.,50747,3
50747,These are a little too flimsy for my taste.,50747,3
50747,I'm afraid I might break them.,50747,3
50748,"Did not last long before getting rusty looking, but was beautiful while I had it, wore it nearly daily during the summer and really sparkled.",50748,3
50748,For the price it was as expected.,50748,3
50749,Shoulders are a bit boxy and I feel like if I wash it a bunch itll start to deteriorate.,50749,3
50750,The advertisement suggests selecting a size 1 to 2 sizes bigger than what you would normally select in U.S. sizing.,50750,3
50750,I recommend 2 sizes bigger for layering and 1 size bigger for non layering.,50750,3
50750,The hood does not have a cord to cinch it up.,50750,3
50750,The jacket is comfortable and I expect to get some use out of it for the rainy spring season.,50750,3
50751,Its a good thing one wears these for a very short time.,50751,3
50751,Because they seem to be very tight.,50751,3
50752,The size fits like expected.,50752,3
50752,But the buttons on the bottoms are very poorly attached.,50752,3
50752,I had to reattach two buttons after the first wash.  Great feel of fabric and the top fits snuggly.,50752,3
50752,I have a smaller chest and it lifts nicely.,50752,3
50755,"The quality is fine like a firm felt, just doesn't fit very well.",50755,3
50755,"I thought I bought a child's hat or a little girls when I tried it on, but the heading did say for ladies.",50755,3
50755,The box also came to my house looking like it it got ran over a few times by a car but the actual hat inside wasn't damaged.,50755,3
50756,I don't have much of an opinion on these.,50756,3
50756,When I got them they looked more denim like than in this picture.,50756,3
50756,I hated the look.,50756,3
50756,Sent them back immediately.,50756,3
50757,"I like it, but it's completely shapeless.",50757,3
50757,Maybe that's the point?,50757,3
50757,But it just doesn't look like the photo.,50757,3
50758,I loved the color and print on the shirt.,50758,3
50758,I ordered a medium and it was huge.,50758,3
50758,I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.,50758,3
50759,Beautiful colors and good quality cotton.,50759,3
50759,Unfortunately it changes shape and shrinks dramatically after first wash.,50759,3
50760,It was too big in waist and too long although this is better than being too small.,50760,3
50760,"Altering it myself, hoping I can get it to hang nice.",50760,3
50760,The beads on the picture my daughter ordered from were red which highlighted the fading to red effect.,50760,3
50760,The dress came w/blue beads on it so trying to figure out how to replace the blue beads w/red beads without unraveling all the other beads.,50760,3
50761,"Stone was not as red as shown in picture, however for the price what should one expect.",50761,3
50762,worked for a small one year old with eczema.,50762,3
50762,Stopped her from scratching her face.,50762,3
50765,It's ok but comes too tight and long,50765,3
50766,I loved the pattern on this suit and was hesitant ordering one offline.,50766,3
50766,I usually wear a large so I ordered an XL and it fit surprisingly well.,50766,3
50766,The only thing is that the chest part is spaced very far apart.,50766,3
50766,My nipples were almost showing because of the poor coverage.,50766,3
50766,I wear a 38 C. But I simply sewed the middle of the suit together to pull the cups together and viola!,50766,3
50766,Bottoms are a little tight but not too uncomfortable.,50766,3
50766,Overall I am satisfied especially with the price of the suit,50766,3
50767,I ordered this bathing suit for my annual FLA Keys trip.,50767,3
50767,It was cute but the bottom fit very snug around the legs.,50767,3
50767,I  not a big woman and ordered a large.,50767,3
50767,The fit was ok except for the bottom.,50767,3
50767,The holes also left me with tan lines that looked like the bathing suit.,50767,3
50767,The suit is made very well and I like that the hunter tied.,50767,3
50768,"not great quality, but it served it's purpose.",50768,3
50768,"too bad the blue wasn't the same as the picture, it's more pale.",50768,3
50769,"Nice jewelry, but not great on a small nose.",50769,3
50770,didn't like the outside material but perfect fit,50770,3
50771,Expect to get exactly what you pay for.,50771,3
50771,I wouldn't feel comfortable going to the beach in this.,50771,3
50772,"These are beautiful plugs, but as another reviewer stated, the flares are very large and would be impossible to get in without a blowout if you're a solid 4g.",50772,3
50772,"If you've been at four for a while and could easily stretch into 2's, I imagine these would work great.",50772,3
50773,Different texture than expected.,50773,3
50773,Though the alien on the side is a little too far off to the side to where it goes a bit onto the sleeve.,50773,3
50773,Other than that it's quite nice.,50773,3
50774,These shortalls fit a little small!!,50774,3
50774,Order the next size up from what you'd normally wear!,50774,3
50776,"I would have given a 5 star, but one of the earrings has a bent post.",50776,3
50777,"Pretty roomy, but the quality is good.",50777,3
50778,I have a posterior tibial tendonitis in my left foot that causes it to overpronate and my arch has started falling.,50778,3
50778,I was looking for arch support insoles that didn't try to do too much in other areas-- I didn't want a lot of heel cushioning or pads on the ball of the foot.,50778,3
50778,These are pretty comfortable.,50778,3
50778,"The arch is in the right spot (although the arch is a little low for me) and the heel cup doesn't lift my heels up too high, but they're WAY too wide.",50778,3
50778,"They are trimmable, but I don't think that applies to the sides.",50778,3
50778,"If they had a narrow option, they'd be great.",50778,3
50779,"They're great, until you wash them.",50779,3
50779,The small rubber elastics around the lace area fall apart and then you're pulling out tiny thin rubber pieces out for weeks.,50779,3
50780,Product details say the hat is about 13 inches by 12 inches by 8 inches.,50780,3
50780,"The one I got is 17"" x 18"" x maybe 8"".",50780,3
50780,Just to be clear - it's enormous.,50780,3
50780,This thing will slow down global warming.,50780,3
50780,"You could not drive a car, kiss your wife or stand in line wearing this thing.",50780,3
50780,"Yeah, I'll keep it; it was $20...but it feels like a golf umbrella on my head.",50780,3
50781,The top fit as expected but had what looks like a small rust stain right in the center of the bust area on the middle feather.,50781,3
50782,It arrived creased because it had not been packaged properly and was squezed in the package.,50782,3
50782,If it hadn't come from China and hadn't been cheap enough I would have returned it.,50782,3
50782,I had to put it in water and reshape it by putting towels inside.,50782,3
50782,It's still not perfect.,50782,3
50782,"It's a little too big, and does not have a way to adjust the size, so I had to buy something at ""Head Covers"" to adjust it.",50782,3
50783,After a few months of wearing the fabric started bubbling out and become harsh and rough.,50783,3
50784,Its lovely but fits too small,50784,3
50785,Its way thinner then it looks on picture but its fine I guess,50785,3
50786,ITS OK.  CHEAP LOOKING.,50786,3
50787,This print is very pretty and so is the style.,50787,3
50787,The problem is the material is like a windbreaker!,50787,3
50787,Weird and not a nice dress fabric.,50787,3
50787,"If you roll the sleeves, then you will see the back side of the material which is white- so it has a very cheap feel.",50787,3
50787,"I ordered the large and I am 5'7"" 150lbs and it fit fine, but I will be returning this as it is NOT what I expected.",50787,3
50789,"It a beautiful ring!, but it looks small in my hand, it ok!",50789,3
50789,I will consider for future the wide of the ring so nevermind.,50789,3
50790,"honestly, I'm female and I wanted to get a size slightly baggy like in the pic...nope, they fit to my legs, and I'm pretty sure I got a medium or large, and I'm also 5'8"" with big calves.",50790,3
50790,"The fabric is not the best and the waist is kind of tight but I can wear them around the house anyway, haha.",50790,3
50790,But they're more like skinny jeans fit on me.,50790,3
50791,"It's a nicely built wallet, still using it as I can't afford to buy another one right now.",50791,3
50791,"That being said, I wouldn't buy it again as it doesn't fit my style.",50791,3
50792,"It is really cute, but where it is supposed to say always my friend, it says always my friond",50792,3
50793,"Looked nice in the front, but material thin and showed every lump in the back.",50793,3
50793,Also shorter in the back than I expected.,50793,3
50793,"Otherwise, nice shirt for the price.",50793,3
50794,Sized up after reading reviews and the product still ran small.,50794,3
50794,"Red was brighter than expected, although it seems to be made well.",50794,3
50794,Didnt get to wear it on the trip I planned and was bumbed.,50794,3
50795,These shirts have what appear to be an iron on Hanes logo where as my other Hane's tees are printed and there is no tactile difference when you run your finger over the cloth.,50795,3
50795,When you touch the logo on these it feels like plastic.,50795,3
50795,These are actually a very good quality shirt - but not for wearing under a dress shirt.,50795,3
50795,They are at least twice as heavy as the Hane's shirts I bought at the store.,50795,3
50795,So heavyweight I can't wear them under a dress shirt comfortably.,50795,3
50796,"I wear medium size shirts, but I thought it best to go up a size.",50796,3
50796,(Also read reviews that it runs small).,50796,3
50796,So I ordered a Large.,50796,3
50796,"When the package arrived, I was thrilled to open it but quickly disappointed when I held it up.",50796,3
50796,"Realizing it didn't resemble a large, it slipped on easy enough but it was tight around my upper arms.",50796,3
50796,Material isn't the best quality but still pretty cute.,50796,3
50797,Cute hate but looks better on a girl.,50797,3
50797,It's a really wide floppy rim.,50797,3
50798,A little big and the fabric is a lot softer than I expected.,50798,3
50798,"Absolutely no ""hold"" on my assets",50798,3
50799,First thing - the material isn't canvas.,50799,3
50799,"It is more of a ""plasticy"" type of material.",50799,3
50799,"Also, when I got the bag, there were some issues with the zippers, but they disappeared after working the zippers for a while.",50799,3
50799,"Based on other reviews, it seems like a common problem.",50799,3
50799,"Apart from that, I loved the bag - it has a good number of compartments, and they are very spacious.",50799,3
50799,"If not packed, the bad doesn't look very big, but you can definitely get a lot in there if needed.",50799,3
50799,"So, despite of the disappointing surprise with the material, I decided to keep it.",50799,3
50799,It was great for about a week.,50799,3
50799,"After a week, the strap disintegrated at the seam!!!",50799,3
50799,"I was traveling, so returning the bag was not an option.",50799,3
50799,"I patched it up myself and I continue using it, but I feel like I shouldn't have to have this problem with a BRAND NEW BAG...",50799,3
50800,This dress is a great color and a good fit.,50800,3
50800,The material is kind of thin and you can see everything as far as your shape goes.,50800,3
50800,The material isn't too see through but it is thin.,50800,3
50800,I ordered a size up to be on the safe side and I'm glad I did.,50800,3
50801,"A few of the gems fell off after one wash, but I suppose that's unavoidable.",50801,3
50802,"40D/33/42 woman, typically wears a size xl or 1x and I'd need this to be about 50% larger to fit.",50802,3
50803,I was really looking forward to getting these tunics.,50803,3
50803,"I just caught the legging bug, and I've been looking for tunics to wear with them.",50803,3
50803,"They are a bit baggy, but I like them that way.",50803,3
50803,"I like the patterns, and the cut, that is just as expected.",50803,3
50803,"I am 5 foot tall, and the longest parts of the cuts come at least to mid thigh or longer.",50803,3
50803,the shorter parts of the cuts covers my bottom and front.,50803,3
50803,"The problem is that to top is completely see through., The material is so thin that i have to wear a tank underneath or everything shows.",50803,3
50803,"Even if I were to wear a flesh coloured bra, it would all show through.",50803,3
50803,"This tunic was meant to be layered, or it was meant to be worn by someone braver than I!",50803,3
50804,It is a good size and color.,50804,3
50804,"However, after only 1 week, it already had damage with minimal use.",50804,3
50805,Not like the picture,50805,3
50806,The description doesn't say no Fly so i expected a fly.,50806,3
50806,"I mean after all, I pee standing up like most men used to, so I kind of need a fly.",50806,3
50806,They seem to fit well although they are slightly more of a low rise.,50806,3
50806,If they weren't underwear I'd definitely return them.,50806,3
50807,Didn't like the way they fitted,50807,3
50808,I normally wear a ladies size 10.,50808,3
50808,"Based on fit description from previous review & sizing chart, I purchased a Size Large.",50808,3
50808,"I find that it is loose enough in the hip area to drape nicely, but it is rather tight across the stomach.",50808,3
50808,I believe an XL would have been a better choice.,50808,3
50808,I am keeping the skirt because I like it overall.,50808,3
50808,I will just have to plan on hanging it to dry.,50808,3
50809,It's WAY TOO small.,50809,3
50809,"I bought this backpack for my 6th grade daughter and her 2"" binder won't fit.",50809,3
50809,She had picked the backpack herself and was really disappointed.,50809,3
50811,Was kind of disappointed because I couldn't get it to glow my granddaughter was very upset,50811,3
50813,"First, I want to point out that I'm roughly a US 12, but I have large arms for my size (probably closer to a US 16 for my arms).",50813,3
50813,"I ordered the size 12 (I followed what would fit most properly around my bust) and it fits fine, but it's how it fits my body is why it doesn't have a higher rating.",50813,3
50813,"I am 5'10"", and have a longer torso and arms.",50813,3
50813,"Because my arms are wider than most my size, my arm fills the sleeve completely, meaning it's breathable, but there is no extra room like on the model.",50813,3
50813,The arm length is also about 2 inches too short.,50813,3
50813,"Compared to the model photo, the sleeves end on my right above the wrist.",50813,3
50813,"I'm self-conscious about my figure (and large arms) and try to either go for the nice ""flowy"" look, or an hour glass look.",50813,3
50813,"With the shorter, more fitted sleeves, and then having a lot of excess fabric for the stomach, I just felt I looked really boxy and wide versus ""flowy"" like the model.",50813,3
50813,"However, that may be more a problem with how I'm built versus the top itself.",50813,3
50813,"Again, if you are more evenly proportioned, you will probably like it if you follow your bust size on the sizing chart.",50813,3
50813,"It is a thin material (there is a thin second layer for the torso so it's not see-through), so if you're self-conscious about your arms like myself, you can wear this in hot temps just fine.",50813,3
50813,"However, if you have larger arms for your size, you may feel funky in this top.",50813,3
50813,"I ordered another top from Zanzea as well, and it fits perfect, so it's just the style of this particular one!",50813,3
50814,"Fit as expected, but the outer layer just didn't lay right.",50814,3
50815,It ok  for the  price.,50815,3
50815,Worth wat was spent but not impressed,50815,3
50816,The material is fantastic however one size does not fit all.,50816,3
50816,I am short and the crotch only comes up to my mid thighs.,50816,3
50816,Will be giving them away or returning them.,50816,3
50817,"Still cute, but almost an empire waist, not as pictured.",50817,3
50817,EDIT:  waiting for my refund to post.,50817,3
50818,The shirt fits perfectly.,50818,3
50818,The shorts are huge.,50818,3
50819,"The boots are ok, but a little cheap looking and they are really large",50819,3
50820,Leather is a little thin though so it does feel a little cheap.,50820,3
50821,ran smaller than I expected  - love it except for the fact that it is not the fit I expected,50821,3
50822,Much cuter in the photo.,50822,3
50822,I gave them to my daughter because they were hideous like clown pants.,50822,3
50823,Did not like the color to ugly,50823,3
50825,"I'm not a fan of the waist band on these leggings but otherwise, it's a good buy.",50825,3
50826,"My 12 year old grandson likes them, but I thought the material was a little thin, and they were a little big.",50826,3
50827,This dress is very nice the color is exactly what I was expecting and the embroidery is quite good.,50827,3
50827,The problem is the size.,50827,3
50827,"It's a bit on the small side, and it's not as long as I was expecting it to be.",50827,3
50827,"I'm about 5'7"" and the longest part of the dress came to just below my knees.",50827,3
50827,I thought it would reach the lower part of my calf.,50827,3
50827,I really wish that the Chinese companies who are selling on Amazon to American consumers would tweek  their sizes.,50827,3
50827,"They make such cool stuff, but often only petite women can ware them.",50827,3
50828,"I was hoping the material would be a little bit nicer, thicker, stronger... something.",50828,3
50828,"It just seems very wrinkled and I don't think washing will help, but shrink even smaller.",50828,3
50828,"I'm sure I could probably stretch it in the wash, but I don't want to take a chance with such sad material.",50828,3
50828,"And for my very sensitive skin, it's just not pleasant to wear.",50828,3
50828,The photo online makes it seem so much nicer.,50828,3
50828,I was expecting more from this.,50828,3
50829,The watch is great my husband loved it but we had to return it because there was a piece on the watch that wasn't made right too short it is where you latch it through the different holes.,50829,3
50829,Otherwise it is really cool.,50829,3
50831,"These run small, so based on the reviews I ordered a size up and they fit perfectly.",50831,3
50831,"They have some glue showing around the sole, like the color of rubber cement.",50831,3
50831,They are comfortable though.,50831,3
50832,"for $5 you can't do much better, cheap breakable and they scratch and scuff easily so you have to take good care of them.",50832,3
50832,"They look good and fit well which is important, I would get them if you don't wear them often or near sunglasses for driving as that is what I use them for",50832,3
50834,"I like the product it was a very cute necklace but unfortunately poor quality, one of the charms fell the second time I wore it and of course I couldn't find it.",50834,3
50835,It's what you'd expect for a costume wig.,50835,3
50836,Still haven't worn it in though,50836,3
50837,"This thing is really big, maybe just a bit too big.",50837,3
50837,"It is hard to remember which side is which (I always seem to open the credit cards when I want the cash and vice versa), and The change purse zipper pull gets in the way when you try to close the cash side.",50837,3
50837,But I love that it's vegan and the style is nice.,50837,3
50838,"Kinda loose, wish it were a bit slimmer.",50838,3
50839,"Fits correctly, but did not like the print.",50839,3
50840,i love american horror story that's why i wanted this shirt but after receiving it the fabric of the shirt was made out of a weird material it irritates my skin and it's too small,50840,3
50841,"Super cute and great fit, but all the stitching came out of the hem at the bottom of the shirt within a month.",50841,3
50842,The ball is so small i cant even get it into place :( cute it is worked.,50842,3
50843,I have a fairly small chest but a broad ribcage.,50843,3
50843,"to make this work, i have to put it on then put a regular bra over top of it.",50843,3
50843,"I have to pull it down a few times a night, but it does make low cut shirts and dresses look good.",50843,3
50844,This belly button ring is much cuter in person than it is in the picture.,50844,3
50844,I had to take it out after a night of wearing it because it was way too small for me.,50844,3
50844,"The shaft/rod was too short, so it dug into my skin.",50844,3
50844,"It might fit other people, it just didn't fit me.",50844,3
50845,Its large for baby.,50845,3
50846,"It's an ""ok"" watch.",50846,3
50846,I'm glad it's in my collection though,50846,3
50847,Thats all I gotta say about that!,50847,3
50848,The material is soft but one suit arrived with a hole.,50848,3
50849,i should of bought a larger one,50849,3
50850,So I ordered this wanting something a little loose and not too short on its own that I could wear in summer.,50850,3
50850,I'm 5'8ish and normally wear about a large and I read that someone my size bought one and it was good but a little baggy if anything.,50850,3
50850,That was ok with me so I went ahead and ordered a large.,50850,3
50850,"(I should have know better, since sizes from Asia usually run small)
When I got this dress and tried it on, it was definitely a disappointment.",50850,3
50850,"Not terrible, but not what I was looking for.",50850,3
50850,"It fit very snug, almost bodycon-like, and showed off my curves more than I wanted it to.",50850,3
50850,It was also quite short in the front and the difference in length from the front to back was way more drastic than pictured.,50850,3
50850,It also has a hole in it.,50850,3
50850,"I've decided to keep it for what it is, though, but I have to wait for fall when I can wear it over leggings.",50850,3
50850,"Disappointed for sure, especially since this item was a birthday present to myself.",50850,3
50850,Also ordered another dress that I ended up giving to my sister for the same problems (minus the hole).,50850,3
50850,I hope this review was helpful.,50850,3
50851,The chest area is too small.,50851,3
50851,"According to the measurement I ordered a large, but definitely does not fit my bust size.",50851,3
50852,It is a good looking belt however it is not very stout.,50852,3
50852,I have dress belts that are heavier material.,50852,3
50853,I'm not crazy about the fabric but thats what you get for this kind of price.,50853,3
50853,The sweater is MUCH smaller than the picture makes it look though.,50853,3
50854,This coat runs fairly small.,50854,3
50854,"I'm 5' 10"" and a size 10, I usually purchase XL coats so I can layer comfortably.",50854,3
50854,"I bought this coat in an XL and with just a single layer underneath it's snug, but wearable.",50854,3
50854,I can't comfortably sit when it's zipped.,50854,3
50854,"However, it is very warm and durable.",50854,3
50854,Great for the Chicago winter.,50854,3
50854,The hood is very roomy and comfortable.,50854,3
50854,"I often find that hoods are thin and not very useful, but not here.",50854,3
50855,Bottom was too large,50855,3
50856,"Alright, but scratches easily.",50856,3
50857,Very beautiful dress but my daughter but had to alter dress because her chest size was smaller than the dress.,50857,3
50858,Really love the color and material but too small especially at the hips.,50858,3
50858,Only buy if you are a tiny person.,50858,3
50859,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who has dreads.,50859,3
50859,Her hair is bulky and most head gear does not fit her.,50859,3
50859,This did fit her loosley.,50859,3
50859,The downside is the shedding!!!,50859,3
50859,Unfortunately it sheds more than my dog and two cats.,50859,3
50859,"Its still very soft and does not seem to be ""missing"" hair, but it can not be work with dark color clothes due to the excessive shedding.",50859,3
50860,"I still like it, but the arms/elbows are tight.",50860,3
50861,You can see the lines of it beneath your clothes.,50861,3
50862,small quality isues with the stitching where the bones were placed however easily resolved with a needle and thread,50862,3
50863,I am a busty woman and the XXL is too tight for me.,50863,3
50863,Usually I wear large.,50863,3
50865,Runs a little short.,50865,3
50866,It was partially my fault I suppose for not reading it in it's entirety.,50866,3
50866,"However, this is indeed a GIRLS shirt.",50866,3
50866,"As in, it is meant for children.",50866,3
50866,"I received a large, which is my usual size, and could barely fit my arms in it.",50866,3
50866,"It was disappointing, but as I said before, I did not fully read the product description and such for the shirt.",50866,3
50866,"That said, the shirt itself is actually pretty nice.",50866,3
50866,"It's pretty sturdy, since I could put it on and take it off without ripping anything.",50866,3
50866,The print of Garnet is very nice and was not faded or cracked (even after putting it on).,50866,3
50866,I'll wear it as a house shirt or when I don't mind showing my stomach a bit lol.,50866,3
50867,Very nice but smaller than expected!,50867,3
50868,"hurts when i sit down, pokes really bad.",50868,3
50869,"The item is described as a fleece jacket, but there is no fleece.",50869,3
50869,It is simply a thin stretchy fabric.,50869,3
50869,"However, I like the design so will keep it for occasions when I don't need warmth.",50869,3
50870,Looked rally cute but my son at the time wore 18 months.,50870,3
50870,I ordered a 2T the shirt and bottoms were really snug.,50870,3
50870,I had let him wear it the shirt open with another shirt underneath.,50870,3
50870,Also the shirt was thin.,50870,3
50871,"Gave them to me daughter, for me too tight, don't like the material but my daughter likes them",50871,3
50872,Everything was perfect but I wore it with  A white bra and underwear.,50872,3
50872,And the color bleeds.,50872,3
50872,It made my white bra and underwear look dark and dirty because the color was rubbing off.,50872,3
50872,It looks really nice.,50872,3
50872,But it was poorly made.,50872,3
50872,Because  The color blood off quite a bit and ruined if you have my clothes so I wouldn't recommend wearing it with light colors if you do get it,50872,3
50873,I loved it at first lots of people saying how pretty  but the chain started to change color  but then wit wasn't that  much money going to see if I can change  the chain on it,50873,3
50874,Loved these not one was the same only downfall with these was how easy the balls break on them but for the price a good deal,50874,3
50875,Cute for a night out.,50875,3
50875,Not practical for every day.,50875,3
50875,"Keys, small wallet and small phone is all it can hold.",50875,3
50875,Comes with a little card holder.,50875,3
50877,It's turning green awfully fast.,50877,3
50877,"My daughter was happy with it, but the quality is sinking fast.",50877,3
50878,I ordered 3 sizes larger and it was still very tight.,50878,3
50878,"I wear L, I ordered XXXL still ti tight...quality was pretty good, but again make sure you order atleast 3 x than usual...",50878,3
50879,It runs small - try a size up.,50879,3
50879,otherwise it appeared comfy and well made.,50879,3
50879,Too bad they don't carry a larger size for me!,50879,3
50880,Love this dress but it was just too big.,50880,3
50880,I wear a 4 in dresses and the small was too large on me.,50880,3
50883,This item fit okay but slipped down through the night.,50883,3
50883,I think it would have been helpful it had rubber trim on the inside to stick to my body.,50883,3
50884,"Like the style, but runs small.",50884,3
50885,This top runs big!,50885,3
50885,"I got a 3X to be on the safe side (I'm 5'5"" 235) and it was way to large.",50885,3
50885,I should've gotten the 2x.,50885,3
50886,"The price was right, but the thickness is something I am not too sure on.",50886,3
50886,I don't wear my pendant on it often in fear that it will break since the pendant is so heavy.,50886,3
50887,I accidentally ordered one size too big and it wasn't worth the hassle of returning.,50887,3
50888,The blood is usable but I have definitely used more realistic and better quality products.,50888,3
50888,If this is for child Halloween cost gym it will do just fine but any more advanced sci-fi make up you should consider paying more money for something of higher-quality,50888,3
50889,"The material is really thin and a little scratchy, the back zipper gets twisted inside out easily, this dress is pretty  fragile but also sexy.",50889,3
50890,Super cute.... super see through :(.,50890,3
50890,Must wear under shirt,50890,3
50891,Would have been good.,50891,3
50891,Would purchase something again ....just bigger!,50891,3
50892,"Ordered the XL and was disappointed in the lack of size consistency as the white ones were too small, but the darker (black) fit good.",50892,3
50893,It's dificult to order without trying but the reviews were.,50893,3
50894,Not true to size but close.,50894,3
50894,Split is a little bit too high though.,50894,3
50894,If I were to sit down you would see all the goodies.,50894,3
50895,The bodice part was a little too clingy for my work environment.,50895,3
50895,But a cute dress.,50895,3
50896,"Fit well, easy on and off.",50896,3
50896,"Durability not so great, started pulling apart from the rubber bottom.",50896,3
50897,I love it but three days into wearing it the top ball came off so I had to buy a temp top to hold it in place until I get back home.,50897,3
50897,I really wish the top ball didn't come off so easy.,50897,3
50898,I do not like the outer fabric band/velcro closing.,50898,3
50898,It would be better entirely velvet with elastic on the back.,50898,3
50899,"I would opt to splurge a bit more on a pair that wicks away sweat better, and is more breathable.",50899,3
50899,This is a great pair for weight lifting and doing minimal body movement.,50899,3
50899,"It looks super cute, but if you're looking to kick-boxing or yoga/ anything where you are moving your legs and waist a lot in a short period of time, opt for a pair that moves with your body better while staying in place.",50899,3
50901,"Not crazy about the material, sort of a stretchy type, sleeves are tight and are not 3/4, they are just over the shoulder.",50901,3
50901,"It is longer than I thought it would be, but I  can use.",50901,3
50902,I love this bag!,50902,3
50902,"I bought it because I needed a larger bag for traveling with my dog, a Pug, occasionally.",50902,3
50902,"You can stuff it with your stuff and theirs(food, treats, medicines).",50902,3
50902,The strap is nice and wide but not so wide that it constantly slides off of your shoulder.,50902,3
50902,There are 2 issues that I wish the company would take into consideration.,50902,3
50902,The color is supposed to be a light brown but definitely has a noticeable orange tinge.,50902,3
50902,I'm keeping it because these days almost anything goes!,50902,3
50902,2) THE ZIPPERS are extremely fragile.,50902,3
50902,They used a too thin zipper pull connected to the actual zipper by 2 jewelry-grade jump rings!,50902,3
50902,It's obviously so flimsy!,50902,3
50902,Very pretty and dainty looking.,50902,3
50902,"I've been lucky to be gentle and not break them as of yet, however, I will be looking for a sturdier way to replace those zipper pulls!",50902,3
50903,I have ordered the packed of 5 but only packed of 4 came today.,50903,3
50903,I would have given 5 stars for this because the sports bra fits perfect and I am already in love with the fabric but just disappointed that I received incomplete.,50903,3
50904,Material is VERY thin.,50904,3
50904,"They are comfortable, but I am noticing that after a few wears and washes they are starting to deteriorate quickly.",50904,3
50905,Cheap quality but very cute.,50905,3
50905,"One side is longer than the other on the one I received, but you can't really tell when it's on.",50905,3
50906,As a big girl I had ordered a a large size.,50906,3
50906,Unfortunately even then it did not fit me.,50906,3
50906,The size they sent me could fit a size small person.,50906,3
50907,I thought my slouche beany would be so much more slouchy.,50907,3
50907,It fits a bit close to the head.,50907,3
50907,I love the feel and love the look.,50907,3
50907,Disappointed in the size.,50907,3
50908,It is a little smaller than I imagined and has a difficult time fitting our larger laptops in them.,50908,3
50909,love the hat except the front part is too large.,50909,3
50909,right where the canvas lining is.,50909,3
50909,i would return it but i have already worn it.,50909,3
50910,I like ke it kinda short in the back.,50910,3
50910,"I am 5feet 6 "" 155 pounds and 29 inch waist if that helps I purchased a large",50910,3
50912,I purchased the wine red in size 18.,50912,3
50912,"It's very boxy, more so than it looked in the product photos.",50912,3
50912,The color is very pretty but the fabric is rough.,50912,3
50912,"Before I washed the dress I checked the seams, they were a little loose.",50912,3
50912,I washed it in warm with like colors and dried on high.,50912,3
50912,I was hoping it would shrink a little but it didn't.,50912,3
50912,It will definitely need to be ironed before I can wear it.,50912,3
50912,"I paid around $18 for the dress, which I purchased for work.",50912,3
50912,"Unfortunately it won't do for work, but will be fine for casual wear.",50912,3
50912,"Overall, I'm content with the dress.",50912,3
50912,I probably wouldn't order it again though.,50912,3
50913,These ties arrived and were more of a sky blue than a mint color.,50913,3
50914,I brought it as a gift.,50914,3
50914,The size that it said was not true to size.,50914,3
50914,My wife had to take it in to get it fitted correctly.,50914,3
50915,Good over a bikini...,50915,3
50916,"I like the Ebuddy Bikini Top Bottom set , however, the straps on the bottoms were loose around the stomach area.",50916,3
50916,Nothing that can't be fixed.,50916,3
50916,Overall the product was fine,50916,3
50917,Nice studs but they were too thick and stuck out too much.,50917,3
50919,"If bigger busted you should order a size larger than the bust shows, this fit shorter than thought on the top half, but still worked and looked nice.",50919,3
50920,The cut of this tank is really not that great nor very flattering.,50920,3
50920,The arm holes come up really high on the side and it's just not that flattering on.,50920,3
50920,More like a man's tank than a woman's.,50920,3
50920,No stretch to fabric either.,50920,3
50920,And the screen print looks cheap.,50920,3
50921,I have a hard time finding hats to fit and this was a little too small for me.,50921,3
50921,I also thought the picture showed more of a silvery finish to it.,50921,3
50921,I knew the color was gray - was just expecting more of a silvery tint...  Plan on returning due to size...,50921,3
50922,It's ok;  seller did fine.,50922,3
50922,Earring is thicker than I hoped.,50922,3
50922,I wanted it flat against the tragus.,50922,3
50923,"Nice quality, but could be an inch or two longer so it will stay tucked in",50923,3
50924,My only complaint with these earrings is that the cat weighs more than the fish.,50924,3
50924,"Other than that, this is one cute pair of earrings that I am proud to wear.",50924,3
50925,I bought this because I wanted the Victoria's Secret version that this version is a knockoff of.,50925,3
50925,But the VS ones are pretty expensive and I knew I was only going to wear this once or twice on vacation.,50925,3
50925,So I ordered it.,50925,3
50925,I took it out of the package.,50925,3
50925,"I threw it in my ""packing pile"".",50925,3
50925,"Upon receiving it, I wasn't immediately impressed.",50925,3
50925,"It was a wrinkled, disheveled mess and the stitching combined with the flimsy synthetic material definitely makes it look cheap.",50925,3
50925,I have seen the VS version in action on girls at the pool and this thing is OBVIOUSLY a knockoff.,50925,3
50925,I still took it on my trip but it wasn't my go-to coverup.,50925,3
50925,I only wore it once and had to soak it first to get all the wrinkles out.,50925,3
50925,It fit just fine and looked cute enough over one of my skimpier bikinis.,50925,3
50925,I got a few comments/compliments on it but I didn't feel nearly as sexy as I probably would have if I had just ponied up the money for the better VS one.,50925,3
50925,Sometimes it really is best to just splurge a little.,50925,3
50925,Maybe it would have looked better in a different color?,50925,3
50925,The white had a cheap feel but maybe the black would have disguised some of the things that made this one look cheap.,50925,3
50925,"Either way, I doubt I will wear it again.",50925,3
50926,started to peel already but I'm hard on my belts.,50926,3
50926,Will buy a better quality one next time.,50926,3
50927,Not what I was expecting to big to much material on the waistband and I was hoping that they were more form fitting but the quality is great and feel great I'm a 34 inch waist and 175 lbs if that helps,50927,3
50928,I have many of these shirts but this is the first time I have bought one and the sleeves are 2 inches longer than all the other shirts I have bought.,50928,3
50929,The picture shows a more quality product but that's not what is received.,50929,3
50930,Great material wrong size,50930,3
50931,Cute shirt - could be a little lighter weight fabric.,50931,3
50932,It does the job but until it's stretched and washed a lot it's uncomfortable.,50932,3
50932,The bottom portion that goes on your stomac could have been tighter but the part right below my chest was extremely small.,50932,3
50932,I would use my hands and stretch it out as much as possible then squeeze into it.,50932,3
50932,The back rubbed uncomfortably also.,50932,3
50932,I just used it as a back up when all of my other nursing bras were in the wash.,50932,3
50932,But eventually it did stretch and soften to a point where it was comfortable.,50932,3
50933,I ordered large going off other reviews.,50933,3
50933,"I am 5'3"" and 110lbs I usually wear small.",50933,3
50933,I should of got a medium.,50933,3
50933,It took about a month to receive it.,50933,3
50933,"The crochet on the shoulders was poorly attached, I had to sew together where it started to come apart, and trim loose strings all around neckline and shoulders.",50933,3
50933,For $7.00 it's worth the price I wore it with pair of leggings and recieved several compliments.,50933,3
50934,Super cute but you get what you pay for.,50934,3
50934,Mine lasted for one day before breaking :(,50934,3
50935,Not as nice as  the picture.,50935,3
50935,The back of the pendant looks like plastic and the chain looks cheap.,50935,3
50936,"It doesn't cover the boob very well on the side actually because of the ""padding"" layer.",50936,3
50937,Material was thinner than I excepted.,50937,3
50937,Worn it twice and i have a hole in it already.,50937,3
50938,This top is not made out of sweatshirt material as it looks in the picture.,50938,3
50938,"Runs small, but still fit cute.",50938,3
50939,"Had to order two sizes larger than I normally wear for this to fit, the bottoms are super cute, the top is still way too tiny... Won't hold anything larger than maybe a B-C cup",50939,3
50940,The shirt doesn't even look like this.,50940,3
50940,It's see thru...really not happy with it at all.,50940,3
50943,"a bit pricey, but... it is what it is I guess.",50943,3
50945,This ran way too small for me.,50945,3
50945,I could barely get it over my head let alone down around my body.,50945,3
50945,The arm length was also too small.,50945,3
50945,Not worth the money.,50945,3
50946,From the pictures I thought the center detail was open lace but its actually iridescent overlay.,50946,3
50946,I'm sort of average in shoulder width but short torso.,50946,3
50946,"Where the cups peak and the straps attach felt narrow to me, but overall fit for 36C was spot on, cups are very sturdy.",50946,3
50946,I gave them to a friend who they suited better.,50946,3
50947,They fell apart fast,50947,3
50948,The product description was spot on.,50948,3
50948,I had my measurements taken and based on the size chart I chose a large when I actually got the item it was way too huge and in sure I didn't lose any weight.,50948,3
50948,... it seemed I should have chosen a small.,50948,3
50948,Luckily it came early so I had enough time to get it altered.,50948,3
50949,"The width is perfect, but it is WAYYYY too short to wear in public.",50949,3
50949,"I'm only 5' 2"" and it hits higher than mid thigh.",50949,3
50949,Not appropriate for the all-white wedding I planned to wear it to.,50949,3
50949,"It's a shame because it's really, really pretty otherwise and I had planned on getting other colors.",50949,3
50950,Good quality just way too small.,50950,3
50951,The belt is nice but runs way too long!,50951,3
50951,It literally wrapped around almost twice!,50951,3
50952,somewhat large for my tall 4.5 yo boy,50952,3
50953,It's beautiful and a really soft silky fabric.,50953,3
50953,"Unfortunately, even though I typically wear medium to small clothing, this is too small.",50953,3
50954,These stockings were hard to get on even in queen size.,50954,3
50954,They also run very easily,50954,3
50955,"Nice and soft fabric, modest coverage with sufficient stretch and a moderate rise.",50955,3
50955,"Not super great, but not bad.",50955,3
50955,They get the job done and are a good price for the quality.,50955,3
50956,I ordered this tank to wear under an off the shoulder shirt that is too sheer.,50956,3
50956,"The tank overall fits true to size, I gave it 3 stars because the description said it was a long tank...it's not.",50956,3
50956,The tank is very short...not what I wanted.,50956,3
50957,I need to workout a little more before this fits right.,50957,3
50958,"Cute, bit I ordered size 24 mnths and received 12 mths instead.",50958,3
50959,Shirt is way too small.,50959,3
50960,I would suggest to size up one.,50960,3
50961,not a very nice dress didi not like it,50961,3
50962,I got 2 of these shirts.,50962,3
50962,They are pretty and feel very nice but they wrinkle so much that I can't use them.,50962,3
50962,One short ride in the car and they are a mass of wrinkles.,50962,3
50962,Unfortunately I already cut out the tags so I can't return them.,50962,3
50963,To small and lace was itchy,50963,3
50964,The neck opening is a bit small.,50964,3
50964,You won't be able to get the look as in the picture,50964,3
50966,"Great gor the price
Not super sturdy, not real silver
But nice overall",50966,3
50967,I got lace 13 and diamond check both in size 13.,50967,3
50967,Both are pretty good fabric and structure for the price and the patterns are more vibrant and quality than I expected.,50967,3
50967,The lace 13 fits perfectly but the diamond check is longer and baggier.,50967,3
50967,I'll keep it for a pool cover up but it won't work over tank tops or dresses.,50967,3
50968,I thought it's more big.,50968,3
50969,"The wristband looked just like it did in the picture when I ordered it, However it was much too big for my wrist and I have a pretty average wrist size.",50969,3
50969,"I think it would be nice if it were to be offered in sizes (sm,med,lg), as you could make it bigger but not smaller.",50969,3
50969,I was also very displeased with the clasp as it broke the first time I tried to put it on.,50969,3
50969,"So all in all the wristband was pretty,but as far as quality I do not think I would recommend it.",50969,3
50970,"It was a little big for my wrist and very hard to get on/clasp, but great for the price.",50970,3
50970,Wore it on a cruise.,50970,3
50971,"This is good, but almost too floppy.",50971,3
50971,We have to fold it back so my 10 month old can see.,50971,3
50971,Looking for a sturdier brim next time.,50971,3
50972,It is tight and don't close in front.,50972,3
50972,It is very short.,50972,3
50972,It is made cheaply.,50972,3
50972,I liked the color.,50972,3
50973,The piece is very well made but unfortunately too large for me,50973,3
50974,I bought this according to size but it was a tad too big and too long.,50974,3
50974,"It helps my posture and made everything smooth but underneath my sheath dress that I wanted to wear it with, you could see the outline of this corset and it seemed unnatural.",50974,3
50974,"Perhaps under a different dress, but I am not sure I would wear it anyway.",50974,3
50974,"When I sit down, the bottom of the corset pokes out.",50974,3
50974,"I must have a shorter waist, I am after all just five feet tall.",50974,3
50975,The suit has no tummy elastic so It does make the suit look like a tent instead of fitted.,50975,3
50976,These go all the way up my leg but slide down to the kneecaps.,50976,3
50976,That is why I'm only giving 3 instead of more stars.,50976,3
50976,"Sizing is great and stretchy but unlike other warmers, they don't stick to your leggings and just slip down.",50976,3
50976,Still a nice color and works tip till the knee.,50976,3
50977,"I got this ring to wear alone and it's a very pretty ring but it's prongs catch on everything, I thought it was more of a channel setting from the picture but it's not.",50977,3
50977,"Also, I thought Titanium was scratch proof but I wore it with my engagement ring and it now is scratched.",50977,3
50977,I'm going to keep it and still wear it but I wouldn't exactly recommend it.,50977,3
50979,Curicifix too small and too lightweight given quality of rest of rosary.,50979,3
50979,Will have to find and replace myself.,50979,3
50980,but the tail is really too large :-(,50980,3
50981,"the mosaic part came off of the link, poor glue, but still very fashionable",50981,3
50982,The bezel is too big and the whole thing is too heavy.,50982,3
50982,Maybe it's ideal for big-wristed manIt looks good though.,50982,3
50982,Haven't tried to use it yet.,50982,3
50983,it was a Christmas gift,50983,3
50984,I love this shirt and my hubby did too if only he could wear it outside of the house.,50984,3
50984,Straight out of the package a button cracked.,50984,3
50984,"I can sew that once  I find matching buttons or simply change all the buttons, yeah simply.",50984,3
50984,"The other issue I can't fix, the shirt is a bit short.",50984,3
50984,"I have gotten other shirts from the same maker, same size and they fit very well.",50984,3
50984,I don't know what happened as my hubby hasn't grown taller (or wider) and the other shirts still fit just fine.,50984,3
50984,"This is a very good looking, well made shirt, so I'm not returning it, my plan is to fix the button issue and donate it to a homeless shelter so someone can enjoy it.",50984,3
50985,Don't often find something I don't care for in this line.,50985,3
50985,"Snug in the chest, stripes are really off.",50985,3
50987,I ordered this belt in a size small (I wear a size 27 pant).,50987,3
50987,The belt appears well-made and looks stylish.,50987,3
50987,It's packed and shipped in such a way that damage received during shipping is virtually impossible.,50987,3
50987,"Unfortunately, the size small was so large on me I'd have to bore more holes into it to make it fit.",50987,3
50987,I wish West Leathers made an XS; I ended up returning it.,50987,3
50988,Product is small for and adult,50988,3
50989,"Small fit, but expected from comments.",50989,3
50990,Glad I got them for the extra tightness under my clothing while healing but it's not like aids with healing in any way...,50990,3
50991,Cute by only for a newborn,50991,3
50993,"Fits nice, but the material is so thin you can see through the shirt.",50993,3
50994,Half of the shirts in this pack were really short.,50994,3
50995,"The material is kind of stiff, the outer pockets are slim, I wish the top zip would open more.",50995,3
50995,The color and the size are nice.,50995,3
50996,"body fit fine, but it was just too long",50996,3
50997,I know I am short at 5'2 but this is extremely long.,50997,3
50997,I am used to dealing this problem but this must be for women at least 5'10.,50997,3
50997,No high heels are tall enough to make this work.,50997,3
50997,I would have to pay extra for a seamstress to shorten it.,50997,3
50997,The quality of the fabric is nice though.,50997,3
50998,"NICE, JUST STRECHES OUT, BUT STILL  NICE",50998,3
50999,"Not a black metal, it looks more silver, but the necklace looks as shown except for the color",50999,3
51000,"The Large size is too wide and long for a waist of 30"".",51000,3
51000,Maybe 2 sizes down is the right fit.,51000,3
51000,Looks great and quality is good though,51000,3
51001,It's just a little too small.,51001,3
51001,But grate thank you guys.,51001,3
51002,If this was a tad larger it would be perfect.,51002,3
51002,"I wear a 14/sometimes 16,  large bust and slimmer through the middle.",51002,3
51002,A XL always fits and sometimes a bit roomy.,51002,3
51002,This definitely fit more like a size 12,51002,3
51003,This suit was extremely small even after I read the reviews and sized up 3 sizes larger than I normally wear.,51003,3
51003,"Other than that, I think it would be extremely cute.",51003,3
51003,"I love the boy-short bottoms of this, which you don't often find in one-piece suits.",51003,3
51003,"It has underwire, which I believe is a must for me and any woman who has a D size or larger bust.",51003,3
51003,"The cups are molded, as well, so all in all there is great support in the bust of the suit.",51003,3
51003,I only wish the sizing was more accurate.,51003,3
51004,I am a very petite women and although my chest is somewhat large for my height the front does not fit at all.,51004,3
51004,You can tell its stretched in all the wrong places and it is not flattering.,51004,3
51004,I wish you were able to tighten the straps yourself.,51004,3
51004,It is cute and appears just as it does in the picture.,51004,3
51005,Sizes run approximately one size smaller.,51005,3
51006,"Nice, but runs short and small even for plus size... had a hard time keeping them up due to shortness in the thighs.",51006,3
51007,"Purchased for a teenage girl, this is cute but tiny.",51007,3
51007,I expected something a little larger in size.,51007,3
51007,Delivery time is lengthy.,51007,3
51008,And more like thin t-shirt material...,51008,3
51009,"The outfit was ok, but the quality of the material was not what I expected or hoped.",51009,3
51010,"It's cute, but not the best quality.",51010,3
51010,It will look nice with leggings.,51010,3
51010,I will wash by hand and hang to dry.,51010,3
51011,Ordered as a gift for my mom.,51011,3
51011,The first necklace she received was broken.,51011,3
51011,UPS picked it up at my mom's residence and returned it at no cost..,51011,3
51011,The second necklace was fine.,51011,3
51011,"I haven't seen it yet, but my mom liked that it has a variety of colors which she can wear with my different tops.",51011,3
51012,It's decent for the price.,51012,3
51013,I gave the seller 1 star for this product.,51013,3
51013,I give the shirt 3 stars but that may be stretching it as well.,51013,3
51013,The shirt is not officially licensed as it states in the description.,51013,3
51013,"The one I received had zero tags on it and the care tag had been cut, leaving only the manufacturer label which is in Chinese.",51013,3
51013,The shirt fits great though and feels awesome; wasn't too loose or too tight.,51013,3
51013,"I ordered large (5'11, 195#).",51013,3
51013,The image was laughable.,51013,3
51013,It seriously looked like they ran it through an inkjet printer.,51013,3
51013,"The front image was streaked with grey, light purple and blue and is difficult to tell what it is supposed to say.",51013,3
51013,The back image was white and quite legible but it looked as though they made a print setup error causing a mirror-image outline which was offset to the right.,51013,3
51013,"In short, the design was poorly crafted.",51013,3
51013,"Not one to be thrown off by someone's misgivings, I was able to remedy the back image issue and I can live with the puke-ish front image.",51013,3
51013,"However if you're one who expects what the description lays out, then avoid this.",51013,3
51013,"Probably best to avoid this seller as well; I waited 33 days for this (it was Prime,ordered 9/26...it never left China until 10/19, a day after I was told that it would arrive!!)",51013,3
51014,The other reviews said to order up as they fit a bit smaller but I found that XL is truly XL so did not fit my daughter too well.,51014,3
51015,They're very small inside ....my baby is 3 months old and has a hard time fitting in it,51015,3
51017,These are nice but did not fit as expected.,51017,3
51017,They were somewhat small and I had to return them,51017,3
51019,Loved the shirt just a little tight for 3x,51019,3
51020,"The lenses doesn't block UV rays at the 100%, 80% at most",51020,3
51021,Material is rather cheap looking,51021,3
51022,I used them in a witch costume includes wore to the fair.,51022,3
51022,They were durable and comfortable.,51022,3
51023,"Desipite I ordered a XL size, when I usually use M size, it was too small.",51023,3
51023,The product quality is acceptable.,51023,3
51024,They are beautifully made but somewhat larger than I expected.,51024,3
51025,"Not as great as I had hoped, but they're fine.",51025,3
51025,I think they fit a bit snug for the size.,51025,3
51027,Not the same tie as pictured.,51027,3
51029,I purchased these as an alternative to wearing heels for my Halloween costume this past year.,51029,3
51029,"While I didn't end up using them for the costume, I did keep them just a an extra pair of shoes around the house.",51029,3
51029,I do like the way they look but they were too big.,51029,3
51029,I wear a Size 7 and they run very large and very wide in my opinion.,51029,3
51029,I recommend ordering a 1/2-1 size down for a better fit.,51029,3
51029,"They do not offer the greatest of support, but like I said, my intent was for a costume that I was wearing for one night out of the year.",51029,3
51029,I do currently still wear them out if I need a quick pair of shoes to run to the car or something but i wouldn't recommend wearing them for long walks around a park or anything.,51029,3
51030,not very impressed with this sweater the  top is so tight and i wear a medium size.,51030,3
51030,to call this one size fits all is rediculous.,51030,3
51030,it stretches across the top and gaps across the bottom.,51030,3
51031,Cheaply made but did the job for a murder mystery dinner.,51031,3
51032,It is pretty but runs very small.,51032,3
51032,I can wear it as a top.,51032,3
51033,"Was shorter than pictured and I'm 5'3""",51033,3
51034,It's a fairly nice looking and warm coat.,51034,3
51034,"But, runs extremely too small.",51034,3
51035,Go one size up if you;re not thin.,51035,3
51036,I got these so I could take the lenses out and do my own project.,51036,3
51036,I found it impossible to remove the plastic lenses!,51036,3
51037,Quality and feel of product is nice but really ran small.,51037,3
51037,The ladies petite was more for a child.,51037,3
51037,It was way too small for me and too small for my 13 year old granddaughter.,51037,3
51039,cute but too small.,51039,3
51039,Looks bigger  then I actually is.,51039,3
51039,gave it too my Lil sister so it can look big.,51039,3
51040,a bit small but okay,51040,3
51041,The quality of this product was as I would have expected it to be.,51041,3
51041,Other reviews also said that the costume ran small compared to the size chart; this is not true.,51041,3
51041,I ordered a size up when purchasing and it was much too large when I tried it on.,51041,3
51041,"I gave the product three stars because the zipper in the back was misaligned and despite the fact that it was too large, the fit was oddly proportioned.",51041,3
51041,"Very loose in the bust and straps, but slimmer through the waist.",51041,3
51042,I bought this last year for Halloween.,51042,3
51042,"I'm 5'0, 104lbs, 32D.",51042,3
51042,"The top fits me just right, although I had to wear a bandeau top inside because I didn't want any peekaboo.",51042,3
51042,"The skirt; however, was ENORMOUS!",51042,3
51042,It was a large; and wrapped around my waist...twice!,51042,3
51042,The sizing was clearly wrong; and it was Velcro :/.,51042,3
51042,"Nonetheless, I used it anyway since Halloween was only a couple days away.",51042,3
51042,I fixed the problem by using pins/bobby pins.,51042,3
51042,"It looked pretty cute, so I give it a 3 star.",51042,3
51043,Color not as bright... Top feel funny on...,51043,3
51043,The skirt is very loose in the waist but tight around the hips,51043,3
51044,"cute swimsuit, but i wish i wouldve known the bottoms are like a thong.",51044,3
51044,"the top is cute and looks just like the picture, but the bottoms are not full !",51044,3
51044,make sure you know what you will get before ordering this !,51044,3
51045,Really liked this charm a lot .,51045,3
51045,It was alittle bigger than I thought it would be.,51045,3
51045,I still like it on my bracelet of family charms a lot.,51045,3
51046,For only small wrist but it's sparkles,51046,3
51047,"The fit too small, and they are see through.",51047,3
51047,You cannot wear these without a tank top underneath.,51047,3
51048,"I like the dress i received, but the belt suits right below my bust, nowhere near my waist.",51048,3
51048,Doesn't look like the pictures.,51048,3
51049,Fits great the material is somewhat washed out not a vibrant black a bit dul.,51049,3
51050,makes my neck itchy but I like the style,51050,3
51051,If boobed and kinda boxy.,51051,3
51052,legs are too large and wide,51052,3
51053,"Not going to wear outside anyway, so it's okay",51053,3
51054,They're cute and I love the color!,51054,3
51054,The material is also very soft.,51054,3
51054,They run a little bit small so you might want to order a size up.,51054,3
51054,I just wish they were in a higher rise.,51054,3
51055,I love it but my booty cheeks hang out.,51055,3
51055,I haven't worn it it love it.,51055,3
51055,Just wish they made the shorts part a little longer.,51055,3
51055,"Totally not made for this Asian booty - but gosh, so darn cute.",51055,3
51056,"I got a medium fits like a small, definitely a belly shirt though, perfect for high waisted shorts.",51056,3
51056,Ships in super fast also.,51056,3
51058,Our Middle Schooler loved this!,51058,3
51058,"HOWEVER... She is very thin, and tall.",51058,3
51058,I bought a size bigger than she needed to give her longer wear with a roomy fit..,51058,3
51058,THIS GARMENT IS VERY TIGHT IN GIRTH AND LENGTH!,51058,3
51058,It is made of a silky material (think old grandma bathing suit).,51058,3
51058,"Not a quarter of an inch to spare, and this material does NOT breath.. As the medium fits- there is no room to wear a shirt under this top..",51058,3
51058,Which is marketed under sweatshirt..,51058,3
51058,This is NOT a sweatshirt.,51058,3
51058,Not one iota of wicking will be had!,51058,3
51058,The pattern is cute and it really appeals to Middle School Girls..,51058,3
51058,Sadly you'll need a thin girl to wear this.. That ticks me off!,51058,3
51058,Lots of girls are chubby before their big growth spurts as they develop into Young Women.,51058,3
51058,"(Our girl is 5'5"" and weighs 104).",51058,3
51060,"The dress is gorgeous, but we ordered a blush and it came in more of a coral color so we had to return them.",51060,3
51061,The color and style is definitely great however after a long day wear arch support seemed necessary.,51061,3
51061,Plus for the price you want to maintain the quality and wear and these for sure skim and touch the ground causing the front to scuff.,51061,3
51062,"The pockets always hangout wide open, which I dislike.",51062,3
51063,Did not fit me and I was not very impressed with the shoe in person compared to online.,51063,3
51064,Jeans look color in the picture then.,51064,3
51065,It arrived as stated.,51065,3
51066,The print is kind of mediocre,51066,3
51067,"While the socks seems to be good quality, I found them not enough stretchable.",51067,3
51067,This makes it difficult to help my toddler wear it.,51067,3
51068,Make sure you get two sizes bigger than your size because it runs small otherwise a nice dress.,51068,3
51071,I loved this bracelet but the second time I wore it one of the strings came loose.,51071,3
51071,I have returned it.,51071,3
51072,It runs real small... Just wish they made them larger...,51072,3
51072,I would buy it again,51072,3
51073,The ties were light and of very cheap fabric.,51073,3
51073,But for the price you cant complain.,51073,3
51073,They did seem to look like skinny ties to me.,51073,3
51073,But other than that for 8 bucks its not bad.,51073,3
51074,Dress was really cute.,51074,3
51074,Originally ordered a size 6 and was too big for my 11 year old then ordered a size 4 and was too small.,51074,3
51075,comfortable around the house,51075,3
51076,Very stylish - average quality - two sizes too small - go figure!,51076,3
51077,I wish the number fit the blouse,51077,3
51078,Not the same color from the picture but it does fit true to size...material thin so you won't be hot in it...I'm wearing mine to my baby shower...so I won't be extra hot...,51078,3
51079,Not as pretty as shown but I kind of like it,51079,3
51080,"just bought it, all snap button come off first time iron, so sad",51080,3
51081,Very soft and nice but too small after washing.,51081,3
51081,I ordered large 12-24 month size for my 7 month old and it is tight!,51081,3
51081,Not happy that I cannot return.,51081,3
51081,Would have ordered larger.,51081,3
51082,Product and materials nice.,51082,3
51082,Wanted to return  was given full refund.,51082,3
51082,Would shop with this vendor again because return was handled so well,51082,3
51083,Cute material but it is very thin cotton.,51083,3
51083,Also the rubber grippers on the bottom of the feet are a joke - they don't grip at all and barely feel any different than the cotton they're on.,51083,3
51083,The cut of this is snug around the middle and my baby will probably grow out of it soon.,51083,3
51084,its made very small order at least 2 sizes bigger,51084,3
51085,These worked better than I expected,51085,3
51086,...unless you pose like the picture.,51086,3
51086,The pockets are kind of a joke - maybe they would fit an toddlers fist.,51086,3
51086,The material is clingy and the overall shape not too flattering for me.,51086,3
51086,The purple color is nice as shown.,51086,3
51086,The sleeves are fitted at the bottom so don't count on pushing up to 3/4.,51086,3
51086,I find it is very comfy though.,51086,3
51086,Company DOES NOT DO RETURNS so want to warn you of that hassle.,51086,3
51086,"ONLY buy from AOSH if it is marked PRIME, else if it doesn't fit you'll be wearing it for jama shirt like me.",51086,3
51087,"Was sent the wrong necklace, then got the right one, but it broke as soon as I took it out of the package.",51087,3
51087,It fell down onto the carpet and two of the clasps on the back came loose.,51087,3
51087,"We were able to fix it with needle nose pliers, but quality is what you pay for.",51087,3
51089,The sizes seem to run small for normal American sizes.,51089,3
51089,Even the XL was too tight for someone who normally wears a 14 skirt.,51089,3
51089,"It would fit on and zip, but was obviously too tight through the hips and thighs.",51089,3
51089,"The fabric quality was good, although it wasn't cut in line with the plaid pattern, which gave it a slightly off-kilter appearance.",51089,3
51090,It says water proof but its not.,51090,3
51091,This is a beautiful watch!,51091,3
51091,I wanted the watch to replace my husband's watches that had died.,51091,3
51091,My husband Is 83 years old and has dimentia and can no longer figure out the time on a watch face.,51091,3
51091,I needed a digital watch which I forget when ordering this time piece.,51091,3
51091,I wanted a solar atomic watch but forgot a digital readout was also needed.,51091,3
51091,"Also, I have set the time to Denver which is in our time zone and the time is consistently incorrect.",51091,3
51091,"I admit that I am probably doing something wrong,but my husband still wears the watch and everyone comments on the style and look of the watch.",51091,3
51091,"I still need to find a digital, solar atomic watch.",51091,3
51092,Sent a large instead of a medium.,51092,3
51092,"Meaning, if you needed a large, it would probably be great.",51092,3
51092,Sent a Large in a Medium package both times.,51092,3
51093,"This would be cute, except for that the straps are so short they dig into my shoulders and are not adjustable, so I need to modify them.",51093,3
51093,"Also, I wear a size small shirt.",51093,3
51094,"DRESS LOOKS NICE IN THE PICTURE, BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, LOOKS A BIT CHEAP.",51094,3
51094,"I AM 140LBS,  5'2"" LARGE WAS TIGHT.",51094,3
51094,IT CAME WITH A TINY BOW INSTEAD OF BIG ONE,51094,3
51097,Pretty but broke right away!,51097,3
51098,It broke when I zipped it.,51098,3
51098,Have to send back.,51098,3
51099,I wished they would have had theses at least in large.,51099,3
51099,I can`t wear them.,51099,3
51101,"A Neat piece but too pointy at top for a Dalek, but going to use as a game piece so it will be good enough!!!",51101,3
51102,The fabric is very scratchy.,51102,3
51102,"It fit as expected and I liked the style, but had to return it due to the fabric being scratchy and rough.",51102,3
51103,"It was a bit small, and it's that cheap ""Bella"" brand that the shirt is printed on.",51103,3
51103,The sleeves are WIDE.,51103,3
51103,"Overall, though, i think it'll work well.",51103,3
51103,I had to wash it and I'll wear it with a bandeau or bikini top under it.,51103,3
51103,"For reference, I'm 5'3 and a size L.",51103,3
51104,Looks like a homemade craft.,51104,3
51105,Its a cute top.,51105,3
51105,"I did order up, which wasn't the best idea.",51105,3
51105,Its now big on me.,51105,3
51105,The lettering is brown.,51105,3
51105,"Kinda cheap, but its not like we're paying 20 bucks for it.",51105,3
51105,"For the price, adorable!",51105,3
51106,Meet expectations just runs half size too small.,51106,3
51107,I have a separated shoulder and the strap keeps falling off.,51107,3
51107,Not as good as the Geni Bra where the strap doesn't fall off the shoulder.,51107,3
51108,"The top was very comfortable, but the shirt was a bit too big for me.",51108,3
51108,It was also see through.,51108,3
51108,It would be cute if worn with a swim suit other than that I recommend wearing a light tank top underneath.,51108,3
51108,I am pretty petite so I order a small but it was still a bit loose.,51108,3
51108,It has many flaws not sure it was worth the buy.,51108,3
51109,This shirt was ordered for my 14 year old daughter to wear under her workout shirts.,51109,3
51109,She has a small build and is skinny but the shirt is still extremely tight.,51109,3
51109,"The quality is good and price was excellent, just next time we order we know to go a size or two up.",51109,3
51109,Will definitely order again as the shirt is cute just a little too small.,51109,3
51110,Too loose was not able to use.,51110,3
51111,I expected it to be white but it is actually closer to cream.,51111,3
51112,Adorable top but way way way too small.,51112,3
51112,I gave it to my daughter who weighs 105 pounds,51112,3
51113,"If only look at the price, 41$ for a leather jacket is really a good deal.",51113,3
51113,And it is really made by leather.,51113,3
51113,"But, all made by tiny small pieces of leathers.",51113,3
51113,How to describe it?,51113,3
51113,Like a soccer ball made by a lot of tiny leathers.,51113,3
51114,"nice, was too small for after birth..",51114,3
51116,"I thought they would be more slouchy based on the picture, but they aren't unfortunately.",51116,3
51117,A bit baggy and mumsy.,51117,3
51117,It looked cuter in the product photos.,51117,3
51117,"It just ages me when I wear it, unfortunately.",51117,3
51118,It's OK. Really thin material.,51118,3
51118,If I had not gotten it on sale I would return it.,51118,3
51119,I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT,51119,3
51120,"Pretty small for an XL, do yourself a favor and order one size bigger",51120,3
51121,Looked so bad in real life I was shocked when I opened the box.,51121,3
51121,Sent it back immediately.,51121,3
51121,The sellers were easy to work with and returned it with no problems,51121,3
51122,Runs very small so a 5XXX Is like an adult large in US sizes.,51122,3
51122,The sleeves are really long too.,51122,3
51122,The top is classy looking but not best quality but expected for price paid.,51122,3
51122,"I washed it in cold and laid flat to dry to get the ""weird"" smell out before I wore it.",51122,3
51122,Ships from China so be patient with the delivery.,51122,3
51123,Really liked it but being almost 6ft tall it was made for shorter women,51123,3
51124,"The head piece looks good, but it is extremely hot.",51124,3
51124,I don't think I could wear it for more than 10 minutes at a time.,51124,3
51124,The arms were much too short for me.,51124,3
51124,I ended up returning it as it wasn't a good fit and I figured it would be too hot to wear all evening.,51124,3
51125,The color is different from the picture.,51125,3
51125,"I thought it is dark green, but it is black.",51125,3
51126,"I'm a 140 pound woman, 5'4.",51126,3
51126,Ordered a medium and it fits like an XL.,51126,3
51126,Need to get tailored,51126,3
51127,"They are perfect for costume use, but not for everyday wear.",51127,3
51128,"Quality isn't the best, but I didn't expect it to be high quality for that price.",51128,3
51128,"My chain broke after wearing it not even 24 hours, that is the reason I gave it only 3 stars.",51128,3
51128,"It does glow a greenish color, as long as you let it charge in the sun or under a bright light for a while.",51128,3
51128,"Altogether it is quiet pretty looking, especially when it glows.",51128,3
51129,"It's a nice color, and a good size, but very cheaply made.",51129,3
51130,"Glitter will definitely be all over the place, about 1/2 size too big so we have to wait for her to be able to wear them.",51130,3
51131,When the shirts arrived they were just fine.,51131,3
51131,"Once they were washed, cold water,  they shrunk.",51131,3
51131,"I buy my shirts a bit large, as I like mobility, so it is not a problem.",51131,3
51131,"The shirts are a little tight in back, but serviceable.",51131,3
51131,The tail is now shorter than I would have liked.,51131,3
51132,I ordered this suit for 4th of July and I ordered a US large (Zmart M).,51132,3
51132,"I am 5'6"" and weigh 125 and I normally wear 32C  bras.",51132,3
51132,The top came in way too large while the bottoms were just too small.,51132,3
51132,I wish I had the option to order different top and bottom combination.,51132,3
51133,A little thin and the lines in it create weird shapes.,51133,3
51134,In general these are pretty good for the price point.,51134,3
51134,"Pro's
Stylish, I really like the polarization at the price point.",51134,3
51134,I've had other glasses similar to these at this price and they look much cheaper than these do.,51134,3
51134,"Cons
I've had some issues with the lenses popping out when I try to clean them, and the nose pads can be very uncomfortable at time.",51134,3
51134,Overall I think i'd try to find a different pair unless there is some improvement on the nosepads.,51134,3
51135,These are nice looking and working shoes - for awhile.,51135,3
51135,"However, The soles are not sturdy at all.",51135,3
51135,"After only about a month and a half of regular use, the soles were splitting and by two months, they're almost unusable.",51135,3
51135,"I love Tesla running shoes, but sadly these are not of the same quality and durability as those are.",51135,3
51136,"cute, great quality but runs small",51136,3
51137,I got these to match the cute top that seems to kinda go with them.,51137,3
51137,"The print does match, but the quality of the pants is much lower than the top and the material is totally different.",51137,3
51137,These are so thin they really can't be worn out of the house if you want to be decent unless you're wearing a really long tunic or dress.,51137,3
51137,I'm kinda disappointed that they are such a poor match to the top that seems like it should match.,51137,3
51137,"I wear a size 16/18 and bought the 2xl in these, they fit fine, but the already thin fabric is stretched so thinin the thigh and butt area that they just can't be worn anywhere.",51137,3
51137,I'm using then as pajama pants.,51137,3
51138,"A little too wide, but short.",51138,3
51139,I ordered a size larger than I would normally get and it still runs small.,51139,3
51139,Not too ugh smaller but you can tell difference.,51139,3
51140,Cute dress but way too large.,51140,3
51140,Can be fixed with some careful sewing though,51140,3
51141,The material is very unlike the real ivory Ella shirts,51141,3
51142,"Great looking glasses, but sadly I have a slim face and they lack those little pads that rest on the bridge of the nose which means they kept sliding off of my face.",51142,3
51142,I have them to my cousin who had the same issue with them but not as bad since her face is not as tiny as mine.,51142,3
51142,"But they really are good looking glasses, if only I could wear them...",51142,3
51143,Really cute - sock is a little thin!,51143,3
51144,The wallet is soft and good quality however it is not the color in the picture.,51144,3
51144,I received a cherry red wallet.....which will be alright I was expecting pink.,51144,3
51146,I normally love these jammies.,51146,3
51146,This pair unfortunately was not good.,51146,3
51146,About 1 month after purchasing they had holes at all the seams and the feet have fallen apart.,51146,3
51146,My son had worn them maybe 4 times.,51146,3
51147,everything fits great besides the waist was to big,51147,3

51148,Bought another one different color and fit perfect!,51148,3
51149,super wrinkled when it arrive .,51149,3
51149,Not the quality I was hoping for.,51149,3
51150,Love the colors and fit..,51150,3
51152,These leggings run small.,51152,3
51152,Other than that they are made well .,51152,3
51152,I usually wear small /medium .,51152,3
51152,I bought these in medium and I probably should of bought s large .,51152,3
51152,I am 5 ft 5 and weigh 125 pounds and they are very tight in crouch area .,51152,3
51152,Gives you camel toe .,51152,3
51153,It's just a bit small for its listed sizes.,51153,3
51154,"Came a little too small, but nice outfit though:(",51154,3
51155,Short in the leg length.,51155,3
51155,Might work if you are 5'2...,51155,3
51156,"OK I will start with saying, that this skirt is cute and color is very vibrant.",51156,3
51156,"But I am returning it, because this material shows every bump on your butt and tights.",51156,3
51156,Also the skirt rides up because the fabric is smooth/slick.,51156,3
51156,This skirt was looser/larger then expected.,51156,3
51156,"Also the pencil skirt part is not so much ""pencily""  as in picture.",51156,3
51156,More straight cut then pencil cut.,51156,3
51156,I hope this review is helpful.,51156,3
51156,I would order size down .,51156,3
51156,But not sure what can you do about all the bumps and undies lines showing .,51156,3
51158,I could not get them around my thighs.,51158,3
51159,These jackets look great but all 4 of them were way too small.,51159,3
51159,I didn't have enough time to return them and get bigger sizes so we had to wear them without zipping them.,51159,3
51159,"I bought sizes Xtra small, medium, XL, and XXL.",51159,3
51161,"I wish you would have had a 3x because it does say it runs small and I have a 2x which runs like a 1 X, it would be nice if you sent me a 3x and I send you back the one I have that say 2 X",51161,3
51162,Interestingly too small in the calf area and way too large in the hips!,51162,3
51163,"It's a bit short in the waist, and a little more staticy than expected, but it's still nice.",51163,3
51163,Comfy and a good color.,51163,3
51163,The sleeves are more 3/4 length than full length.,51163,3
51164,Could probably purchase this item at the local Dollar store.,51164,3
51164,Its OK and serves its purpose but I think I paid too much for it.,51164,3
51165,perfect for lounging around the house.,51165,3
51165,sizing runs a little small so won't be wearing mine out in public.,51165,3
51165,the material is a good value for the price.,51165,3
51166,"the gold like fades very easy and fast, The charm would be fully silver soon.",51166,3
51166,I don't mind though because it is beautiful.,51166,3
51167,Bought this for a school project for my seven year old.,51167,3
51167,The quality of the sunglasses are good but my son complains that it is tight on his head.,51167,3
51167,If my four year old didn't wear glasses I would have given them to him after the project was done.,51167,3
51167,So good glasses but the age range I feel is higher then it should be.,51167,3
51168,Pretty but didn't last a year.,51168,3
51169,"It's ok.  Had to lace up the back on my own, the shirt its self runs small and short.",51169,3
51170,The material is ok.,51170,3
51170,The shirt size an xl seems to be a small,51170,3
51171,"Nice but HUGE, I gave it to a friend.",51171,3
51171,"Unless you want to swim in a big vest, order at least two sizes down.",51171,3
51172,Really cute but very tiny.,51172,3
51173,much cheaper versions available that are just as nice.,51173,3
51174,"love the style, but the first day the clear gems came out.",51174,3
51175,Looked cool but broke after a few weeks.,51175,3
51176,Fits smaller than expected and not as happy with it,51176,3
51177,Gown is made well and the fabrichas a nice feel.,51177,3
51177,I have narrow shoulders.,51177,3
51177,The neckline was too large for my pear shaped build and fell off my shoulders.,51177,3
51177,Would git most people woy a staighter build.,51177,3
51178,It's ok.  One of the blue beads leaves a blue spot on my wrist.,51178,3
51179,It's a bottom and a long piece of fabric for the top that you can wrap any way youd like.,51179,3
51179,It's really then material as well.,51179,3
51180,"Order a size up, maybe two.",51180,3
51181,Broke after little use,51181,3
51182,"It would be good if it didn't have to contain anything, but it does.",51182,3
51182,It's already starting to rip were the strap meets the pack.,51182,3
51182,Good for a one time use.,51182,3
51182,To much money to spend on a one time use.,51182,3
51183,Had to return because it didn't fit my breasts.,51183,3
51183,Too short in the torso as well.,51183,3
51183,Super cute other wise.,51183,3
51183,Better for petite bodies with smaller breasts.,51183,3
51184,I have a moderately large head (7 1/2) and this one-size fits all doesn't really fit that well.,51184,3
51184,It does fit on my head but the hat constricts it quite a bit (giving me a major headache).,51184,3
51184,I normally wear a large (L) sized hat and can say this hat is more for folks in the medium (M) range size.,51184,3
51184,Quality isn't that great either.,51184,3
51184,The fake fur sheds all over the place and it's very thin.,51184,3
51184,You get what you pay for though.,51184,3
51185,Bag is bigger than I thought it would be and has a funny smell took about two weeks to arrive still a nice looking bag,51185,3
51186,Nice quality but way too long,51186,3
51187,some fell apart before arriving,51187,3
51188,This bra made my boobs look like weird deformed creatures.,51188,3
51188,I'm not sure how it compares to other brands since I haven't tried other brands but I threw this away after one use.,51188,3
51190,"You can't put as many items in it as a regular wallet, It will pop open.",51190,3
51191,"Disappointed in this shirt - the fit was much smaller than normal for a 3T, and the gift recipient is very small framed.",51191,3
51191,The fabric is not very thick.,51191,3
51191,"Together, those observations mean that he won't be able to wear this cute shirt very long.",51191,3
51191,"Too bad, since Paw Patrol is his favorite set of characters right now, and the price was not in keeping with the quality.",51191,3
51192,"I ordered this dress for my casual, outdoor wedding.",51192,3
51192,"I wear size 14 in street clothes (pants and dresses), so ordered a size 16 in this dress.",51192,3
51192,"The dress still fits somewhat small, it is tight across the hips (I'm pear shaped so this os somewhat expected) and is a bit snug when zipped.",51192,3
51192,The top of the dress is gorgeous and sits well everywhere except the shoulder area.,51192,3
51192,The transition from the higher skirt to the longer back is awkward.,51192,3
51192,It's much more square than other high-low dresses I have.,51192,3
51192,"I may reorder from the seller that does custom versions of this dress, because I think it could work if the bottom were roomier.",51192,3
51192,I have a tailor who also may be able to make the transition less boxy.,51192,3
51192,"I'd say this dress would work well for someone less pear shaped, but I'd definitely size up.",51192,3
51193,"I like this bella band, but I am worried it might not make it past month 7 but then again neither will my old shorts and jeans.",51193,3
51194,This item is nice and looks as described.,51194,3
51194,I'm concerned it will scratch my glasses,51194,3
51195,cute shirt but I should have ordered extra large instead of large.,51195,3
51196,very pretty but it came with a broken piece off.,51196,3
51197,"Great shirt, big and loose just how I loved it.",51197,3
51197,I can wear it off the shoulder.,51197,3
51197,Perfect as a beach cover-up or a weekend top with jeans or shorts.,51197,3
51197,"However, c'mon, I wore it twice and the seam at the shoulder ripped open.",51197,3
51197,"Okay, I'll fix it, but that's annoying!",51197,3
51198,Buttons are very white on an off white coat.,51198,3
51198,"It was inexpensive so I didn't expect high quality, which it wasn't.",51198,3
51198,"I am 5'9 135, I ordered a small and it is big.",51198,3
51199,These insoles are actually about 3 sizes smaller than the size I ordered.,51199,3
51199,They work ok as a 3/4 length insole,51199,3
51200,"I love the style, when I wear it all my friends want to know where I bought it and I receive a lot of  compliments!",51200,3
51200,"However there's  something about the fabrics, not very breatheable, the ""cotton -linen"" is quite synthetic, I guess.",51200,3
51202,I think it looks great on the front of my truck but it is already fading after 2 months of having it on.,51202,3
51203,They aren't particularly thick which is a good or bad thing depending on what your goals are.,51203,3
51203,I was looking for something to wear with my Hunter boots on a trip to Iceland and they weren't quite thick enough to wear alone.,51203,3
51206,I actually need a medium,51206,3
51207,I am 5'0 I ordered a small.,51207,3
51207,The top part is uncomfortable for me I have to constantly keep adjusting the top part to cover up my cleavage literally my strapless bra shows if I don't adjust it.,51207,3
51207,The dress does hug your body and is nice and thick I don't have complains on that.,51207,3
51207,But if the top part of the dress wasn't so loose i would love the dress but unfortunately I will be returning this dress.,51207,3
51207,The dress came in super fast less then two weeks and www not damaged at Alphonse the pictures help.,51207,3
51209,Quality is good but very small.,51209,3
51210,They're very nice glasses but.,51210,3
51210,I expected them to be much smaller.,51210,3
51210,They're way too big.,51210,3
51211,Runs small to size,51211,3
51212,Fits a bit big and it's a bit long,51212,3
51213,My daughter liked the design and the sweat shirt was comfortable.,51213,3
51213,"The quality of the material is a bit on the thin side for a sweat shirt, however, the colors are as bright as the picture.",51213,3
51214,It was a very small XL.,51214,3
51215,The way the straps sit doesn't work on me no matter how I tied it.,51215,3
51215,Probably super cute on the right body shape.,51215,3
51215,"Also, I usually wear a large, ordered and 2xl and It was the right size.",51215,3
51216,fabric doesn't look as fabulous in real life.,51216,3
51217,so short have to wear it with leggings now,51217,3
51218,For what I paid for it...it's good.,51218,3
51220,It fits as expected - I guess.,51220,3
51220,"I'm 5'5"" and it feels huge.",51220,3
51220,Might look better wearing it with high boots (better for taller girls.),51220,3
51220,Otherwise it feels like a tent.,51220,3
51220,"I wanted a poncho with ""arms"" this has no arm holes.",51220,3
51220,Fully open at sides.,51220,3
51220,Must wear something underneath.,51220,3
51220,Suggested wear for outside events.,51220,3
51220,Too much fabric and weight to wear indoors.,51220,3
51220,Great quality and design.,51220,3
51221,"They are cute, but tight around the waist.",51221,3
51222,These earrings are very pretty.,51222,3
51222,I got the rose gold ones.,51222,3
51222,"I really like them but I've worn them twice and both times they really irritated my ears, which are really sensitive.",51222,3
51222,It's probably the metal that is irritating to me but it could be the fact that I find the wires to be thicker than most earrings.,51222,3
51222,You do need to wear earring backs with these because they will fall off.,51222,3
51223,"After asking others who purchased these earrings if the simulated moonstone looked plastic or not and they said it looked authentic, I bought a pair.",51223,3
51223,I was going to give these as a gift to someone but am keeping them for myself because I feel that the moonstone looks totally plastic compared to genuine moonstone pieces I already have.,51223,3
51223,"The silverwork and garnet is very lovely but the moonstone, notsomuch.",51223,3
51223,I wouldn't give these as a gift but they're okay for myself.,51223,3
51225,"I don't know much about the badges, but my daughter thought they didn't look they way they're supposed to.",51225,3
51225,"I think they look cute, but I bought them for her.",51225,3
51225,"For example, she says the barbells are supposed to be purple and black, while the heart isn't supposed to overlap but there is supposed to be a pink gem in the middle and little bit of yellow at the bottom, the air one is supposed to have two layers of feathers, while the yellow one is supposed to be half yellow and half maroonish-purple?",51225,3
51225,"I don't know, among other things, apparently they're all not up to her standards.",51225,3
51226,"Fits really nice love it, am 5' 140 pounds order L, but the when u wash the black color tens to run lil bit in the whites stipes , i manage to wash good with warm water, can wear it but didt  clean 100%,",51226,3
51227,The clock was shattered :(,51227,3
51230,I ordered a small and it was very big on me.,51230,3
51230,I didn't expect this kind of material but regardless it's an okay dress,51230,3
51231,"Beautiful dress, but the straps were not nearly long enough to give my armpits some room to themselves.",51231,3
51231,It makes you feel completely constricted with movement and just... weird.,51231,3
51231,The dress itself is gorgeous.,51231,3
51231,The material seems to be on the higher end and its well made.,51231,3
51231,Just need some room for those arms to move around and be free.,51231,3
51233,Gorgeous dress - runs small.,51233,3
51233,My girlfriend and I both purchased this dress and it was too small for both of us and we bought based on the sizing they suggested and our sizes.,51233,3
51233,This BRAND is known to run small.,51233,3
51233,Buy at least once size up and if you have a larger waist buy 2 sizes up.,51233,3
51234,"The jackets fits smaller than expected, but I love it!",51234,3
51235,"Its very pretty and came triple wrapped, which I like.",51235,3
51235,but the flower is rather heavy and is very bulky which I don't know if i like,51235,3
51236,"Super cute, but it has holes all over the seems from sitting down.",51236,3
51236,I have a normal size butt too and it shouldn't be ripping so soonly,51236,3
51237,I would recommend ordering a size up with this one.,51237,3
51237,"I like the fabric and pattern, but I have an hourglass figure (42-33-43, typically size 10-12, depending on brand) and the XL pulls a bit in the chest and hips.",51237,3
51237,The fabric is on the thinner side but that can easily be remedied with a slip or camisole.,51237,3
51237,It doesn't wrinkle easily which is a lovely surprise.,51237,3
51238,Really thin and while I love the dress and fit the material is so crappy that it accidently touched some velcro on my purse and now permanantly has a mark from that which really sucks,51238,3
51239,They work as specified.,51239,3
51239,I just did not feel they were comfortable.,51239,3
51239,"Also, since they are clear, if stuff gets stuck in them, you can see it.",51239,3
51241,"The top fits good, going to have to tac the pads in bc they move, but the bottoms do not fit at all!",51241,3
51242,"Cheap material, it went back!",51242,3
51243,"For the price I paid for this, its too much -- the material is thin.",51243,3
51243,But the fabric is comfortable.,51243,3
51243,Also it would be nice if there's front pockets like most hoodies.,51243,3
51244,"I have a beach trip coming up in the next week and due to some unexpected life events, I hadn't had a chance to go shopping for a swimsuit.",51244,3
51244,"I wanted to go alone, without my 3 kids, but with how busy I know I'll be over the next week I knew I wasn't going to have the time.",51244,3
51244,"Like many women, I dread swimsuit shopping.",51244,3
51244,Things just never seem to fit well or look as flattering as you want them to be.,51244,3
51244,"I was nervous shopping for a swimsuit on Amazon, but I decided to try it.",51244,3
51244,"To be safe, I perused the swimsuits, saved my favorites and narrowed it down to 5 suits that had a return policy and ordered those, hoping to find at least 1, maybe 2 keepers.",51244,3
51244,"A little about me: I'm 5'8.5"", weigh 155 pounds and wearing 36C bra.",51244,3
51244,"I have a straight figure, not much in curves.",51244,3
51244,"I don't have my waist and hip measurements, but I do know my waist is only about 3-4"" smaller than my hips, definitely not curvy.",51244,3
51244,I typically wear either an 8 or 10 in pants and a XS or S in tops and I have an average length torso.,51244,3
51244,"As I mentioned above, I have 3 children, all birthed by me, so I have earned my stripes on my stomach and that excess pooch from pregnancy, something I prefer covering up.",51244,3
51244,"When swimsuit shopping, I look for a 1-piece that covers up my belly region and that has some support and padding in the chest area as it doesn't take much to flatten me out.",51244,3
51244,"The suit (I ordered one in red and one in light blue to try on)
Pros: Both colors of this suit that I purchased are very pretty.",51244,3
51244,As stated above I look for a suit that helps cover up my stomach area and masks my pooch as well as enhance my chest and not flatten me out.,51244,3
51244,The picture of this suit looked like it would do both.,51244,3
51244,The chest area of this suit is great.,51244,3
51244,With the crisscross of the material and the molded cups inside it did fit well in the chest area.,51244,3
51244,I did like how it looked on the upper part of my body.,51244,3
51244,"Cons: Normally the ruching, like what is shown on this suit, helps with covering up the pooch in my stomach area.",51244,3
51244,However the material of this swimsuit seems thinner than other suits I tried on.,51244,3
51244,"Also, which I ordered the size recommended for my normal clothing size, this suit felt a little loose on me.",51244,3
51244,"Because of those 2 reasons, this suit did not smooth out my stomach region.",51244,3
51244,"Actually, as shown in my side view, I can even see some ""excess"" on my back that just isn't as flattering.",51244,3
51244,The other suits I tried on kept my back looking smooth....at least when posing for my pictures.,51244,3
51244,"Despite the suit being a little big, I felt like going down a size wouldn't have helped much because of how thin the material was and because the material didn't seem as stretchy as other suit material that typically helps smooth out the figure.",51244,3
51244,Another downside with the suit was the suits seemed designed for a long torso.,51244,3
51244,"I had bagginess in the crotch area, not attractive at all.",51244,3
51244,"Again, I don't think going down a size would have helped as it was really loose compared to the rest of the fit.",51244,3
51244,And pulling it up on top and tying the straps tighter didn't help because then it pulled the chest up too high and I was hanging out below the cups.,51244,3
51244,"I knew once you got the suit wet, the bagginess in the crotch area would be worse as wet material hangs lower than dry!",51244,3
51244,Not something I want to deal with on a public beach.,51244,3
51244,There were just too many cons for me to consider keeping either of these suits.,51244,3
51244,"The price, the colors and the fit in the chest area were great, but the thinness and lack of stretchiness in the material and the loose fit overall just made this a no for me.",51244,3
51244,The only person I would recommend this for is people that have a long torso and have a hard time finding a 1-piece suit that actually fits in length.,51244,3
51244,"If you would like to read my other swimsuit reviews, I believe if you click on my name you can view other reviews.",51244,3
51245,"The watchband itself is ok, but the watchband strap loops are very thin, and easy to break.",51245,3
51245,Broke the attached loop next to the buckle the 2nd time I took the watch off.,51245,3
51246,didn't trust for larger breasts,51246,3
51248,For the amount I paid not bad..,51248,3
51248,I regularly wear a medium or sometimes large.,51248,3
51248,I ordered the extra large and the sleeves were a bit dhort.,51248,3
51248,It had a teally weird chemical smell when I forst got it.,51248,3
51250,I hate the fabric.,51250,3
51250,It looks really cheap.,51250,3
51251,"I really loved this suit, the material is great, this done run a size or 2 small.",51251,3
51251,Im on a weight loss journey so the large is not really what a normal large (12-14) is.,51251,3
51251,"Bummer, but gonna continue to lose weight so maybe next yr it will fit!",51251,3
51252,The dress was very pretty.,51252,3
51252,Had to get it hemmed because it was too long.,51252,3
51252,My bust is bursting out of the top.,51252,3
51252,Had to go bar less.,51252,3
51252,Lots of compliments but I was very  uncomfortable in the dress,51252,3
51253,"Writing smaller than expected, a little hard to read",51253,3
51254,My 2nd purchase and the zipper keeps breaking,51254,3
51255,"Very thin material, great design, runs very small",51255,3
51256,I am going to sew some adjustments to make this fit ebetter- it runs large so it a bit of a tent on me but once I adjust it I will like it very much.,51256,3
51257,LOVE the style and fit!,51257,3
51257,"Just had to deduct a few stars because after only a few times worn, the sweater is pilling under the arm areas.",51257,3
51257,"Otherwise, I love it!",51257,3
51259,Would have preferred it to be a little smaller.,51259,3
51260,It's much spanner than I expected.,51260,3
51260,The pendan is maybe a half inch tall,51260,3
51261,"It was a bit bigger on the top around my boobs, but my friend wore it and she looked amazing!",51261,3
51261,Really well if you have larger boobs.,51261,3
51261,The skirt was longer than I though it would be.,51261,3
51262,Love the look of this but it is closer to a 12-18mo size not 0-6mo.,51262,3
51262,"The sticking also looks a little cheaply done, I had to trim piece off.",51262,3
51262,The fact that this was available for prime is why I ordered it as opposed to others that were priced similarly and took 2 weeks to arrive.,51262,3
51262,"But I think it will work for a baby shower gift, just had to add a few more things to the gift.",51262,3
51263,These (black and gold set) are snugger than I imagined based on the description.,51263,3
51263,"Also, the tan/gold one is darker than the picture, and so does not match the scarf I bought it to match.",51263,3
51263,"And despite being a ""Prime"" listing, it took them nearly two weeks to arrive.",51263,3
51263,So that was far from ideal.,51263,3
51264,sizes should be bigger when u say xxl please,51264,3
51265,Good price but fits much smaller than expected.,51265,3
51266,Bought this for 11 yr old.,51266,3
51266,It's really a SMALL -MEDIUM adult.,51266,3
51266,But my child loves it and won't let me return it.,51266,3
51267,I love the high neck on this swimsuit and the sewn in soft cups...both were perfect for me because I needed the support and modesty for chasing 2 kids at the pool.,51267,3
51267,"The Signature Power Mesh tummy-control lining was nice; however, the leg holes are small and cut into the crease where my leg and hip meet...definitely not the most comfortable feeling.",51267,3
51267,I'm sending it back for a refund.,51267,3
51268,"medium size is also bigger
Does not fit appropriately",51268,3
51269,The band is very tight,51269,3
51270,"Runs large,  I sent it back to exchange it, I haven't got the new one yet",51270,3
51271,Not quite the quality I have gotten before.,51271,3
51272,It is way shorter than it looks in the picture and made out of a very thin fabric.,51272,3
51272,Not sure if it would survive the first wash. Other than that it fits nicely and the color is bright red as expected.,51272,3
51274,"Based on comments and photos she went with a smaller size, medium.",51274,3
51274,"She's 5 ft 3.5inch, bust 36g, waist 33 and 50 inch hips.",51274,3
51274,Skirt fits perfect not to tight but it sits on the hips well but the tank top is too short and barely covers he bra properly,51274,3
51275,Made more for a child.,51275,3
51276,Bag is heavy and difficult to roll.,51276,3
51276,It is to wide to roll down the airplane aisle.,51276,3
51277,"The jacket looked nice, but the sleeves are way too short.",51277,3
51277,I will probably return it soon.,51277,3
51279,Keep in mind that these are Asian sizes not American!,51279,3
51279,It didn't fit but I am keeping it as a goal piece.,51279,3
51280,I'm 5'3 and 120 lbs.,51280,3
51280,and usually a women's size 6.,51280,3
51280,I purchased a medium.,51280,3
51280,I got in it though it is tighter than I'd like.,51280,3
51280,I think a large would have been more comfortable.,51280,3
51280,It also is a little short in the torso.,51280,3
51280,There is lots of cleavage showing.,51280,3
51280,"If I was taller, I don't think this suit would work.",51280,3
51280,Suit material was good quality.,51280,3
51280,For the price I will keep the suit.,51280,3
51280,I'm sure I'll wear it at least once this summer.,51280,3
51281,They are very cute but it's a little loose I should of got extra small but I still love them :)),51281,3
51282,"First of all, I do like this ring a lot!",51282,3
51282,"It's a beautiful and pretty believable ring with clear, well faceted, and radiant stones.",51282,3
51282,The three stars are for the durability of it.,51282,3
51282,"I've worn it, maybe two times, and today when I reached into a cooler at the grocery store, I caught it on the shelf above it.",51282,3
51282,"I noticed right away that the center stone was gone and, amazingly, found it at the bottom of the cooler!",51282,3
51282,I brought it home and tried to place it back in it's setting with some of my jewelry tools but I don't know how long it will stay.,51282,3
51282,"I'm afraid to wear it now, so it will sit in my jewelry cabinet.",51282,3
51282,I sure wish this was made better.,51282,3
51282,"I can't recommend it, really, unless you never do anything when you wear it, or just like looking at it in it's box.",51282,3
51282,"Thankfully, I bought it on a lightning deal and didn't have a lot invested.",51282,3
51283,The pants are a lot looser than I like so I will probably not be wearing them to workout in but lounge in.,51283,3
51284,"This would be ""Asian sizing"" the price is right, but the size isn't.",51284,3
51284,"Quality is actually really nice, bright blue that doesn't bleed, but of course it does me no good if it doesn't fit.",51284,3
51285,"The material is soft and very comfortable especially during summer , it's a summer dress the only reason I gave 3 stars it's because the prints are not long lasting after throwing it to the washer it sticks And starts to be erased or fall out.",51285,3
51286,I love the bag but my zipper broke within a week of me wearing it,51286,3
51287,The cover is pretty but it doesn't hold the phone securely.,51287,3
51287,The bottom right corner sticks up a little and that makes it pretty much impossible to charge the phone without taking it out each time.,51287,3
51287,It also took a long time to come.,51287,3
51288,Bought it for my fianc&eacute;.,51288,3
51288,"Great fit on her, but you could see the padding when she had the top on.",51288,3
51289,Not the type of material I was expecting.,51289,3
51290,It is pretty and I like it.,51290,3
51290,Only thing is that it faded too soon.,51290,3
51291,Perfect my hips were just too wide!,51291,3
51292,"I bought cheap, so I got cheap.",51292,3
51293,"Good price, but not for an athletic fit.",51293,3
51293,Had to tailor taper in the waist.,51293,3
51294,not quite as I expected but it's okay,51294,3
51295,While I like these very much I don't like the fact that they start to get little balls on them after washing.,51295,3
51296,"It's cute, fit a little snug at the breasts, but perfect length.",51296,3
51296,"I looked for any tags, but there were none.",51296,3
51296,I washed it & it shrunk lots!,51296,3
51296,"My assumption is that it's made with rayon, which has a tendency to shrink everywhere.",51296,3
51296,Now the dress is way too short.,51296,3
51296,"However, I'm not returning it because it was so cheap.",51296,3
51297,A little too small...,51297,3
51298,"Well made, just not for my body shape.",51298,3
51300,Ran a little small but other than that they are good.,51300,3
51301,The shirt looked a lot like it did in the picture (I got the grey one) and it fit as expected.,51301,3
51301,"The only real dislike I have was the fabric, as it felt cheap, but given the price, that's understandable.",51301,3
51302,"Expected Asian sizing, ordered up from a L to XXL and the shirt fit but was not flattering.",51302,3
51303,"Fits smaller than expected, order a size up.",51303,3
51304,Cute dress but the red color that I ordered is more of  a maroon.,51304,3
51305,"While it states that it is Official Nintendo, the wallet I purchased for my son reads ""Dhe Legland Of Zelda"".",51305,3
51306,"Thinking this was most probably an Asian sized top, I ordered this in a larger size than I normally wear.",51306,3
51306,"Even 2 sizes up, I am still not able to wear this top.",51306,3
51307,But it too tiny.,51307,3
51307,"I expected it to be bigger, grownup size.",51307,3
51309,hard to buy hats online for correct fit.,51309,3
51310,"Totally the look I wanted, but was way too big for my female head.",51310,3
51310,One size only is discouraging.,51310,3
51311,I returned this dress because it was way too big.,51311,3
51311,I ordered a Medium after reading some other reviews.,51311,3
51311,I wanted it to still have that flowy look but it's definitely really boxy and too large still.,51311,3
51311,It was great material and would have been super comfortable if it fit right but it just looked wierd and way too big.,51311,3
51311,(I'm 165 pounds/ 36-31-42).,51311,3
51311,gave it a 3 star because I think maybe a small would look better and the material is good quality and it was comfortable.,51311,3
51312,after washing the insides became stringy which is kind of dangerous with a little one,51312,3
51313,Pretty but not well  made - a little clunky.,51313,3
51314,Doesn't fit as I thought it would.,51314,3
51315,"First of all my wife is 63, so when she looked at the suit she said it was not ""age appropriate"".",51315,3
51315,"I finally got her to just try it on, it was not long enough and it was too small to fit.",51315,3
51315,With all that backless design she would not wear it even if it fit.,51315,3
51315,For some reason my wife thinks that I am a pervert for choosing this suit.,51315,3
51315,"If you are young and have a smaller body frame, this would be a very sexy suit.",51315,3
51315,"Just to give buyers a ""heads up"", the suit came with one of the back straps not sewn.",51315,3
51315,I e-mailed the vendor and in broken English they said they would give me 30% refund.,51315,3
51315,I never received the partial refund and I had my wife's sister sew the strap.,51315,3
51315,"My daughter might fit into the suit, if not it will be going to the Salvation Army.",51315,3
51316,"Returned it, too small",51316,3
51317,"I ordered many tops and when I went bigger, it hanged off me.",51317,3
51317,I got medium and it fit my  thin 13 year old.,51317,3
51317,Stay tuned yup XL fit me a petite 5'2 118,51317,3
51318,The shirt came earlier than expected but it doesn't look or fit quite how the images show.,51318,3
51318,The v isn't as deep as shown on the models which is really lame because that was the selling point for me.,51318,3
51318,"Also, the shirt comes with the string unattached, so you have to string it yourself (not that big of a deal but still kind of annoying).",51318,3
51318,"I gave an extra star because the material is comfy, soft, and stretchy.",51318,3
51319,Nice shirt but runs way too small.,51319,3
51320,"I always wear a small in leggings but these size Small were so little, I couldn't get them past my knees.",51320,3
51320,They were cute leggings though.,51320,3
51320,I am going to attempt to return them.,51320,3
51321,"nice looking, not a 2X size (a little smaller than a 2X)",51321,3
51322,Baby was still able to slide them off in her sleep even with the Velcro closure.,51322,3
51323,toes wore through first time wearing.,51323,3
51323,I have others that are fine so must have been a rare flaw.,51323,3
51324,These are from China and run small.,51324,3
51324,I did not fit.,51324,3
51324,But it did come quicker than expected and appears to be of decent quality.,51324,3
51324,Giving it a 3 because I cannot confirm if it works.,51324,3
51326,"I had to return it, the fit was not right!",51326,3
51327,Product has some stains and wear... might've been dropped on floors if a display product is my optimistic guess.,51327,3
51327,The lifesaver is very rigid.,51327,3
51327,"Since I ordered this for home dcor, the stains and wear/tear are not too objectionable...",51327,3
51328,"It is a great item no problems or weird smells and got it 4 days after i ordered it, but the only thing is..they sent the wrong one.",51328,3
51328,"It's still very cute, I ordered midnight paisley but they sent midnight blues.",51328,3
51328,"This does make me a little unhappy considering i also order the matching lanyard, but i can see how they might have misread my order.",51328,3
51330,That stainless steel and color is great.,51330,3
51330,But the Jesus part of the chain falls off very easily,51330,3
51331,"nice fabric, well priced.",51331,3
51331,but the overall fit is way too large (esp.,51331,3
51331,Not as expected when looking at the picture,51331,3
51332,"for the cost, just spend a few more bucks and get an express shirt on sale.",51332,3
51332,the quality is crap on these shirt.,51332,3
51332,I would buy it again for half the price.,51332,3
51332,the cut is also long under the armpits making it hard to lift up your arms without untucking the shirt.,51332,3
51332,"I have express, CK, etc, all slim fits and this is by far the worst one.",51332,3
51333,"The bra top looks good on the model, but it looked awful on me.",51333,3
51333,"I thought the top had cups in it, which it did not (the model HAS to be wearing some kind of supportive cup for her figure to look like that; no one is shaped like that or that smooth without support).",51333,3
51333,"I am a C, so I need support.",51333,3
51333,"The top made me look saggy, not sexy, and I thought I was going to poke right through it, so to speak.",51333,3
51333,I emailed the seller to ask for suggestions on how to improve the top and got an automatic reply from Amazon saying to allow 2 days for a response.,51333,3
51333,I never got a response from the seller.,51333,3
51333,"I have taken the top and cups I bought to an alterations person, and I am hoping she will be able to fix it to my satisfaction.",51333,3
51333,"The skirt is definitely big, but it is very adjustable, so no problems there.",51333,3
51333,The shorts are a nice addition so you can decide how exposed you want to be.,51333,3
51333,"In general, it's a pretty costume if it fits you right.",51333,3
51333,"If you're smaller than a C cup, you might be fine with it as it is, but if you're any bigger, I'd say steer clear unless you plan to purchase some kind of adhesive or sew-in cups.",51333,3
51333,"It's reasonably priced, but I think it's important to know that you're not getting any kind of support or shape from the top so you can decide if you want to either invest the extra time and effort to add some, or pay a little more for a costume that already has what you need in that area.",51333,3
51334,"I missing yellow flower, and clasp won't open!",51334,3
51334,It would be pretty otherwise.,51334,3
51334,I can't wear it,51334,3
51335,Cute but smaller than I like!,51335,3
51335,I have never bought a sarong that barely would tie.,51335,3
51335,This is made for small petite women!,51335,3
51336,Looks great but is on the small side.,51336,3
51336,It's a medium/large but is very tight on my head.,51336,3
51337,"This outfit was cute, and looked like the picture, but I just wasn't a fan of how it fit my hips (i'm somewhat hippy).",51337,3
51337,"if you're into jumpers/one-pieces though, this may be okay for you.",51337,3
51338,A tad small in the chest area but I am large in that area.,51338,3
51338,The beige lining sticks out a bit in the back at the bottom and the sequin is very scratchy on your arms when you put them at your side.,51338,3
51338,This would never be good for dancing your skin on your arms would be tore up.,51338,3
51338,Might keep for a 1 time wear on my honeymoon then toss it.,51338,3
51339,"Love the glasses, but do not use the bag!",51339,3
51339,"Ordered the orange, they fit my 8 yr. old son perfectly.",51339,3
51339,"He only wears them on occasion, they are not his regular ""sport"" sunglasses,  so he was excited to have a bag to keep them in.",51339,3
51339,"Well, he kept them in the bag, ""protected"", and the bag turned them black!",51339,3
51339,"They were literally stored on his dresser, nowhere near the sun, not in a backpack or purse or anything like that.",51339,3
51339,Now he won't wear them.,51339,3
51339,"I wish I saw this before the return/replace window closed, but as I mentioned he only wore them occasionally.",51339,3
51339,Be warned if you purchase a color!,51339,3
51340,I think this corset is good quality.,51340,3
51340,However the sizes are bigger than described.,51340,3
51340,I took my measurements before ordering and when I received the item it was too large.,51340,3
51340,Will be buying again but in a smaller size.,51340,3
51340,Also the laces are more shoe lace style and not rope style as the picture shows.,51340,3
51340,Overall good quality though.,51340,3
51341,I'm 5'3 and 110 lbs and this is very loose.,51341,3
51341,I'll have to redo the waist band.,51341,3
51341,The shirt is also loose but short so it's ok.,51341,3
51342,Great value but as a thermal goes is extremely thin material.,51342,3
51342,My husband had to wear two pair.,51342,3
51342,To replace his older thermals.,51342,3
51343,The fit of this is more boxy like.,51343,3
51343,"Shrunk more after wash. My daughter loved it when she got it, but hadn't worn it after we washed it",51343,3
51344,Cute style but insanely small.,51344,3
51344,I sized up one size from my usual but it was still too small.,51344,3
51344,"As a 45-year-old woman, one size up usually works with me for juniors tops.",51344,3
51344,"I was expecting a slim fit, but this was skin tight.",51344,3
51344,"I considered exchanging it for a larger size but when I realized that the seller does not provide free returns and I had to pay return shipping, I didn't want to risk having to return it again.",51344,3
51345,The dress arrived with a small hole in the back of it so I had to return it.,51345,3
51345,Otherwise it is a very nice looking and fitting dress.,51345,3
51346,The boots are fine but they run extremely small - I'd say at least 2 sizes.,51346,3
51346,I needed a size 10 but the ones we received were the exact size as the old size 8 boots we had at home.,51346,3
51347,"I like this blouse under a jacket or cardigancardigan,  but not alone.",51347,3
51347,My husband says it looks like a pillow case and he is probably right.,51347,3
51348,The picture looks more like a sweater but it's a thin shirt.,51348,3
51348,I took off the chains on the shoulder and I think it looks a lot better without them.,51348,3
51349,I ordered the gray but received sky blue.,51349,3
51349,Quality is what you would expect for the price.,51349,3
51350,"Good fabric, but it doesn't fit as expected.",51350,3
51351,"Super cute, but WAY too small.",51351,3
51352,a bit too large for the credit cards I wish it were smaller,51352,3
51353,"Broke quickly..While I know its 10 dollars, it shouldn't break in 5 weeks.",51353,3
51353,"Also when it came in, it had a scratch on the lens.",51353,3
51354,Can't unclamp the bracelet off my wrist pls help,51354,3
51355,These are very cute but they do run small,51355,3
51356,Nice but smaller than it looks in the pictures,51356,3
51357,I REALLY wanted to like this bag.,51357,3
51357,"It would be great for travel or work, or just when you have a lot to carry.",51357,3
51357,"The problem is that there is a center divider zip pocket, which is not described on the Dooney site, the Ilovedooney site, nor here.",51357,3
51357,The exterior and interior are perfect Dooney quality.,51357,3
51357,I was really just looking for more of a classic tote.,51357,3
51358,My daughter loves it Got it for Christmas,51358,3
51359,Great on waist and back nice fit after I cutt off the ass enhancement part wow that makes I nice ass go bad.,51359,3
51359,So I recommend going with a thong kind and thigh high stocklings to get the effect this is creepy in motion.,51359,3
51361,"It's totally cute, but beads are plastic.",51361,3
51361,They have faded snd crapped out within first week.,51361,3
51362,The only thing is the belt wear out already where the holes are.,51362,3
51363,Didn't like the fact that the pages are not clear enough,51363,3
51364,The batons are too far apart and legs are narrow.,51364,3
51364,It opens up in between each baton in legs.,51364,3
51365,Way too small especialling cup area,51365,3
51366,"If you wear a medium, order large, or you'll just end up throwing them away like I did.",51366,3
51367,Nice quality and fit.,51367,3
51368,"Good looking and very good material, but the buckle release button it's hard to open it to release the belt.",51368,3
51368,But other then that it's a good product.,51368,3
51369,Material is a bit thin but the fit is ok,51369,3
51370,its see through on the sides.,51370,3
51370,looks two tone but its see through.,51370,3
51370,"Slutty, not black sexy classy.",51370,3
51370,material is nice through,51370,3
51371,Ordered extra large and was still too small.,51371,3
51372,These are adorable gloves but they stretch out very fast.,51372,3
51372,They are eztremely cheap though so they're worth the money I guess,51372,3
51373,Semi see through and larger that expected.,51373,3
51373,"5'6"" - 125lbs

Shipping was faster than expected!",51373,3
51374,My bust size is right around 34.,51374,3
51374,I got a medium and it fits well.,51374,3
51374,The material seems fine and I really like the color.,51374,3
51374,I gave this 3 stars because 1) the collar is very big and 2) it's slightly shorter and wider than I'd prefer.,51374,3
51374,"If this shirt was about an inch narrower and an inch longer (I like these shirts long so they'll stay tucked in), and if the collar wasn't quite so large, it would probably be perfect.",51374,3
51377,"This is so cute, but I have to return it because I can't find any thongs/undies that don't show underneath it.",51377,3
51377,The material is thin so it literally shows everything you wear underneath it.,51377,3
51377,I would recommend this for someone who is comfortable not wearing any panties or bra with this outfit.,51377,3
51377,Sad I have to return it because it fit like a glove!,51377,3
51378,gives better support to your foot.,51378,3
51379,"Very cute bag, but too small.",51379,3
51380,It is cute I'll give it that.,51380,3
51380,It's cotton and pretty soft.,51380,3
51380,But it runs too small.,51380,3
51380,I got the 24mos one and my one year old barely fit in.,51380,3
51380,And I guess they didn't use good dye.,51380,3
51380,"Its color fade after the first wash, and I use baby detergent with gentle circle.",51380,3
51381,"the lower part is super big but the bra fits perfect, that's really a problem",51381,3
51383,Love it..I was soo worried about fitting but it came out soo good..Dont expect too high about cloth quality but its good..,51383,3
51384,The top is nice.,51384,3
51384,A few challenges was I noticed a permanent iron crease in the blouse running from the bottom of the neckline to the base of the blouse.,51384,3
51384,Also I ordered a small.,51384,3
51384,im a 103lbs and it was a bit wide.,51384,3
51384,An XS would have probably been ideal.,51384,3
51384,Had it altered at a seamstress.,51384,3
51384,I've worn the blouse to work and it is quite flattering.,51384,3
51384,Not a bad purchase.,51384,3
51385,It's a cute piece but I didn't like the closure.,51385,3
51387,Like the fabric and overall fit but the sleeves are on the tight side.,51387,3
51388,they are a little too short and the feet are very odd and uncomfortable until they stretch and form.,51388,3
51388,Seams at late come apart easily.,51388,3
51389,I like it but it broke within a week,51389,3
51390,Everything feels and looks great except they are too small.,51390,3
51390,I cannot wear them at all,51390,3
51391,A bit coarse and faded than shown in the pictures.,51391,3
51391,I was expecting them to be more vibrant in color.,51391,3
51392,"Although I like the color and the material of this shirt/dress and it fit me, I don't like wearing it.",51392,3
51392,It fits very funky.,51392,3
51392,I am a large breasted lady and I purchased this as a casual long shirt to wear with leggings.,51392,3
51392,"I guess the best way to describe how it fit on me would be, super snug on my breast, loose in the middle and tight around my upper thigh.",51392,3
51392,"Which by the way, I have no butt or hips, I'm like a upside down triangle.",51392,3
51392,So I can't recommend this product for girls with big boobs.,51392,3
51392,"Again, the material and the color are nice, it was delivered on time and in good condition.",51392,3
51393,Sorry but will be returning.,51393,3
51393,"Horrible chemical smell and stiff, starchy material.",51393,3
51393,Not at all as pictured.,51393,3
51393,However the seller was fantastic and resolved issues as best as possible.,51393,3
51394,"I love this shirt, granted its a little long and I'm pretty tall.",51394,3
51394,"I am 5'10"" and the back of the shirt covers my butt completely.",51394,3
51394,So if your a shorter girl don't expect it to fit like the picture.,51394,3
51394,"Shipping didn't take as long as was expected, however the quality of the shirt is slightly questionable.",51394,3
51394,"The seems in the arm pit areas seemed to be fraying a little bit, but it didn't keep me from wearing the top.",51394,3
51394,Overall for the price its super cute.,51394,3
51395,Order wrong size so it fits me quite bigger then normal.,51395,3
51396,They were very big for being specified as newborn size.,51396,3
51396,And my newborn was 10 lbs.,51396,3
51398,"after re-ordering this specific 'Mother of the Bride' Hat, it was perfect!",51398,3
51399,I usually wear a small but ordered a medium bc i wanted a baggy shirt.,51399,3
51400,I wouldn't recommend these unless you thin.,51400,3
51400,Came out very tight but my size was appropriate.,51400,3
51401,I thought this dress was beautiful.,51401,3
51401,"It ran somewhat small in the hip area, but I guess my hips are a little larger than I thought, which is obviously not the company's fault!",51401,3
51401,My problem with the dress was the the tare.,51401,3
51401,"When I opened the bag to the dress, which was VERY nicely packaged, and pulled out the dress, the dress was ripped in the back.",51401,3
51401,My heart was broken.,51401,3
51401,"Overall, this dress is a phenomenal dress especially for the price.",51401,3
51401,"You can't go wrong, maybe just order a size or two bigger.",51401,3
51401,It's better to have to pay a little extra for alteration than it is to not have a dress fit.,51401,3
51402,"The sequins look tacky and are only glued on, if you have strong curves.",51402,3
51402,"For an example, I'm 5'4 and my measurements are around 35'ish 26' and 45'ish, this is not the dress for you.",51402,3
51402,"The hips are very tight and I ordered an 8 while usually a 7 or even 6 pending on styles, as well as the bust, and there is loose material at my stomach as though I'm meant to have a belly not a butt.",51402,3
51402,Go with A-line cuts my curvy friends.,51402,3
51403,Bottoms cut way into my thighs,51403,3
51404,Belly band was too small for the wife.,51404,3
51404,"It seemed like a great product, otherwise.",51404,3
51407,It fits a little small  but cute,51407,3
51408,its good but the wrists and ankles were too big.,51408,3
51408,IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS GET IT ONE SIZE SMALLER.,51408,3
51408,IT IS TOO BIG IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES,51408,3
51409,Beautiful piece but not what I expected.,51409,3
51410,SHoes are being returned for a larger size.,51410,3
51410,"Based on all the reviews,.I ordered a youth size 4 for my son who wears a 5.5  He battled to get his foot in them and they were as tight as one would expect a size 4 to be on a size 5.5 foot.",51410,3
51410,So my experience is not to go along with the suggestions to order 2 sizes smaller!,51410,3
51410,I am reorDering in the right size.,51410,3
51410,We will see what happens now!,51410,3
51411,Ordered this from my previous orders list.,51411,3
51411,The second bracelet I received was NOT the same as the first one.,51411,3
51411,This one was darker colored and smelled like a tannery.,51411,3
51412,Ordered large and it still was a little tight.,51412,3
51412,And I am a size 6-8 normally.,51412,3
51414,"Love how the dress fits, the top fits tight and the dress fits good too.",51414,3
51414,The quality isn't the greatest.,51414,3
51414,"There were random strains of thread but for the price, it was a great outfit.",51414,3
51414,I also bought the black one.,51414,3
51414,I would buy again.,51414,3
51415,"It's good for very light use,  I used it for 3 months as a daily belt and the letter like end started to come apart.",51415,3
51415,It's low cost and gets the job done/ very comfortable and love to water it.,51415,3
51416,Started to make my back hurt and isn't tall enough for long torso women.,51416,3
51416,Had to stop wearing.,51416,3
51417,This dress is for flat chested ones.,51417,3
51417,"It is beautiful but I could not fit in (I am 5' 4"", 130 Lbs, 36 C).",51417,3
51417,"Since there was no free returns, I got only partly refunded.",51417,3
51417,Hoping to get it altered at a reasonable price.,51417,3
51417,It looks gorgeous though.,51417,3
51418,"""Tomato"" looks more red in the photo but actually very orange",51418,3
51419,I ordered an extra large and it was still tight and short.,51419,3
51419,I love the tank itself.,51419,3
51420,"Not really a tank top, more of a shirt with the sleeves cut off.",51420,3
51421,"No issues, wife likes it",51421,3
51422,Order a size up for sure.,51422,3
51423,"I would have given this more stars because I like the rings-- my issue is with the fact the description said 6 pcs which I thought would be 6 rings... instead I received 3 rings, 1 gift box and 1 thank you card.",51423,3
51423,which is still only 5.?,51423,3
51424,Becomes unstable and hard to roll with even the lightest load.,51424,3
51424,"Tips very easy, needs extra ""ties""",51424,3
51425,ordered these once before but this time they were very tight..,51425,3
51426,It was made pretty cheap and not something I will probably not wear .,51426,3
51426,Gave to grandkids to play dress up,51426,3
51427,I did not realize that the dress had no underlining.,51427,3
51427,The dress is muuuuch smaller than expected.,51427,3
51427,"Because of the two factors I just listed (all lace/see through and too fitted to add a lining), I've turned it into a Home only freakum dress for my Fiance'.",51427,3
51427,"I am 5'4 weighing 153 lbs, 38DD/28 in waist and normally wear Mediums....I ordered a large and can barely fit it over my 40 in.",51427,3
51427,"Sexy for inside play, not for outside wear.",51427,3
51428,Nice skirt got the large.,51428,3
51428,I'm 5'7 195  But one draw back the elastic in side is not stitched all around the fabric of the skirt.,51428,3
51428,It is only stitched on the sides.,51428,3
51428,I'm afraid when I wash it the elastic will not stay in place.,51428,3
51428,For that reason I give it a three star.,51428,3
51429,Material was a little rough and there was A LOT of padding.,51429,3
51429,I mean A LOT!!!,51429,3
51429,The colors are great but they they are more for a lower cut top instead of every day comfort.,51429,3
51430,quality is good for price but runs small,51430,3
51431,you have to bend the earings to make them stay,51431,3
51433,"Really cute, way to big.",51433,3
51434,ok pattern is a little different from the picture.,51434,3
51435,"Based on other reviews, I ordered a size larger than my calculated size.",51435,3
51435,I'm proportioned pretty evenly top and bottom.,51435,3
51435,"The dress fit me well in the shoulders and bust, but was large in the waist and skirt.",51435,3
51435,I had to have a seamstress take it in from the waist down.,51435,3
51435,"The biggest problem was the zipper - supposed to be an invisible zipper, but when they sewed it in, they caught the lace in multiple places and it was impossible to open and close the zipper without it catching.",51435,3
51435,I had to have the seamstress fix the zipper as well.,51435,3
51435,"I also took off the ""bling"", which was just cheap clear plastic chips loosely tacked on with white thread.",51435,3
51435,"Finally, I ended up with a beautiful and well fitting dress, but it was a lot of work to make it that way.",51435,3
51435,"If you're not good at alterations, think twice about ordering this dress!",51435,3
51436,It is cute BUT it broke down right away.,51436,3
51436,The outfit ripped and seams undone in a few spots the night I tried it on.,51436,3
51436,I ended up going with a different costume for Halloween because I was afraid it would keeping breaking:(,51436,3
51437,The top is a bit too small.,51437,3
51437,I'm a B-cup and I definitely have to readjust quite often while I'm wearing it.,51437,3
51438,"It's such a beautiful cover, it's a shame that I couldn't wear it.",51438,3
51438,"I bought a large and it fit in the shoulders, however it didn't even come close to covering my bust.",51438,3
51438,"I know that my Daughter will love it though, so I'm keeping it for her.",51438,3
51439,It's really cute but runs super small...,51439,3
51439,"I'm 5'9 and 140, feel like I would need an XL based on their sizing",51439,3
51440,Didn't care for the looks of them,51440,3
51441,Fits good and is a very cute dress the only thing is it's very see threw :( and you can see my bra my stomach even my undies threw the dress,51441,3
51442,I like the material.,51442,3
51442,It's a bit wider then I expected but it definitely works if you know how to wear it and what to wear it with.,51442,3
51443,Cute capris but they run at least 2 sizes too small!,51443,3
51443,I am trying two sizes up and hopefully I've calculated correctly.,51443,3
51444,cute locket but chain broke the first day I wore it.,51444,3
51444,guess that's why it was such a good price.,51444,3
51445,This Item is just okay.,51445,3
51446,These are a little small.,51446,3
51446,"I thought they would be okay in size, but should have gone up one size.",51446,3
51446,Also they are super see through.,51446,3
51446,So make sure you have a long shirt to cover your butt since you will see whatever is on your underwear.,51446,3
51446,"Expected these to look nicer, but were not as great as I wanted.",51446,3
51447,Not a very stretchy material.,51447,3
51447,"I'm 5'6"" and the sleeves were very short on me.",51447,3
51447,Wasn't as cute as the photograph.,51447,3
51448,The dress fit perfectly and was really cute except for the fact that it was very see through!,51448,3
51449,"top was to small, skirt so cute I had to find another top",51449,3
51450,"They're great glasses, just the lenses are regular adult size, not children.",51450,3
51451,"They were exactly what I was looking for, but the fit runs large & floppy.",51451,3
51452,"I had read the reviews and ordered a size larger than i would need, needless to say the shirt is still tight.",51452,3
51452,:( Guess i will have to give it to someone else.,51452,3
51453,"It's just a white t-shirt, nothing fancy (except the embroidered BOSS logo on the bottom/side).",51453,3
51453,"Got it on sale for 4 bucks each so it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend this at regular price.",51453,3
51454,"Regular tanks for me, not compression.",51454,3
51454,Not what I was looking for but its okay.,51454,3
51455,Liked the look but the top was too big.,51455,3
51456,I love this shirt.,51456,3
51456,I got a 2x and it's a tad sort but not to sort that I can't wear it and it fits my large chest just fine.,51456,3
51456,"I did think it was a navy color when I bought it but it turned out to be black, not a problem I just wish I knew when I bought it.",51456,3
51457,Looks better in the photo.,51457,3
51457,"It doesnt lay very well on my body, is kind of funky, but its cute.",51457,3
51458,Is not a choker.,51458,3
51459,I haven't worn these yet so can't comment on performance.,51459,3
51459,That's why I am only giving 3 stars...but I love the fit.,51459,3
51459,They are slightly snug but I think they'll be fine after worn a little while and they are very flattering compared to other waterproof pants.,51459,3
51459,"They are too fitted around the ankle to go over boots, so will have to wear them tucked inside my snow boots.",51459,3
51461,Not the same color at all.,51461,3
51461,The royal blue is almost neon.,51461,3
51461,It's still cute and I still wear it but not what I ordered,51461,3
51462,Really cute but the bow on one of the sides fell off before I got to wear them!,51462,3
51462,I just cut off the second bow and they're still cute,51462,3
51463,Pictures cute but you really get what you pay for here.,51463,3
51463,"The necklace turned black while turning my neck green, and the color came off the back of the charm and is now an odd almost copper color.",51463,3
51463,So I got a silver necklace and wear it anyhow because I really do like the picture.,51463,3
51463,Just an FYI in case you do put it on a real silver necklace: DO NOT allow ANY jewelry cleaner to touch the pendant.,51463,3
51463,It takes the coating off the wolf picture and makes it all cloudy.,51463,3
51463,"Yes, I did this to a different necklace not to long ago.",51463,3
51465,"The weight of the ring is nice, not to heavy.",51465,3
51465,I wish the engraving would have been a little deeper to show off the beautiful design.,51465,3
51466,"Nice kingship, sleeves a little short but I'm 6'3 so it's understandable.",51466,3
51466,A good value for the price.,51466,3
51467,Wow it's so tiny!!!,51467,3
51467,I am having to wear it as a knuckle ring,51467,3
51468,"the material was a bit dissapointed for me, only that it is made of cotton spandex will suit a casual wear  , the style is similar though
its just okay",51468,3
51469,I ordered a Large.,51469,3
51469,"The tag inside the garment said XL but Zeagoo's tag attached said L. In any case, it's a bit snug.",51469,3
51469,It's a basic windbreaker with no lining.,51469,3
51469,I haven't yet worn it in rain.,51469,3
51470,My niece love it,51470,3
51472,Great quality headpiece was big!,51472,3
51472,My daughter love it,51472,3
51473,Strap broke :( I've contacted the seller in hopes that they can be replaced.,51473,3
51473,"Other than that, they're very cute sandals.",51473,3
51474,I like the look of them and they fit great but I can hardly see out of them when I'm outside.,51474,3
51474,When I go to drive I can't see where anything is when I go to get into the car and I can't see the spedometer or any of the gauges.,51474,3
51474,Wish I was able to use them more like for driving.,51474,3
51475,"Size 6 is a little long and big for me ( 5.2 ft, 130 lb)",51475,3
51476,"Cute suit, but fit is a little smaller than I expected!",51476,3
51477,Ran a little small and the attachments are flemsy,51477,3
51478,"My only complaint is that the Vincent Van Gogh ""Starry Night"" socks are purple --- I don't think is quite what I had in mind.",51478,3
51479,"Looks like blood but don't leave it for too long it stains, my kid likes to perform and we used it on his face he must have had it on for about 30 mins max his face was stained for an entire day and it also stained my sink which got me super pissed.",51479,3
51480,I got a medium and it feels like a extra small,51480,3
51481,"Belt looks okay, but made from a type of rubbery vinyl.",51481,3
51481,The buckle is nice and came with a protective film.,51481,3
51481,For 5 bucks it's a win.,51481,3
51481,I ordered 2 of these but only received one.,51481,3
51481,Waiting for the seller to address this.,51481,3
51482,Did not know you needed special tool to wear them.,51482,3
51482,I make jewelry so I put them on a ring mandrel and opened them up enough so I could use them without tool.,51482,3
51482,You should put in your description that you need a tool so people will know.,51482,3
51483,Would have been great if it had fit properly.,51483,3
51483,Had to return the dress.,51483,3
51484,The sizing chart said small/medium would fit a small.,51484,3
51484,It was way too big for me.,51484,3
51485,Doesn't look anything like the picture on the model... Kind of disappointed.,51485,3
51485,It came really wrinkled so I'm hoping that's the reason why it looks so bad on me.,51485,3
51485,I'm 5'2 and 115lbs 32c... the material bunches in the front and is very unflattering.,51485,3
51486,The material was nice but the fit was a bit small.,51486,3
51486,Also it didn't fit on me as a tunic more like a small sweater.,51486,3
51486,"I am 5'7"" tall thin 160lbs.",51486,3
51486,I was really hoping for a tunic so that I could wear this with leggings but I cant do that because it doesn't go past my waste.,51486,3
51487,Didn't know that the bathing suit top has to be tied by you.,51487,3
51487,Doesn't come the way it is in the picture.,51487,3
51487,It's more of a wrap that you have to tie yourself to make a top.,51487,3
51488,I normally wear a size 10 but I ordered up so I could wear with thick socks.,51488,3
51488,It's a good thing I did because these boots run small.,51488,3
51488,"They are okay for the price, not what I was expecting.",51488,3
51489,I like the video that was made out of but the size did not match the correct size chart  I really would've liked it if it's just the correct size,51489,3
51490,"Nice shirt, but way to short",51490,3
51491,If you are a bit busty definitely go with the XL.,51491,3
51491,"Also, I would suggest taking it to a dry cleaner rather than washing it at home.",51491,3
51492,Was not happy with quality of this top.,51492,3
51493,2 buttons broke off the first time i whore them,51493,3
51494,Quality thin but cute.,51494,3
51495,fit good in the being but then got all out of shape.,51495,3
51496,Runs large I bought a Md to be safe I usually wear large and it was still pretty big.,51496,3
51497,The quality of the materials is the reason this product got only 3/5 stars from me.,51497,3
51497,"I like the hat in general, it's cute after all, but the materials are cheap in my opinion.",51497,3
51497,Construction is overall is good.,51497,3
51497,I would not recommend this product to a friend.,51497,3
51499,Thought these were somewhat cheap sunglasses until I only got about three hours out of the pair before it fell apart.,51499,3
51499,The price per hour is kinda high!,51499,3
51499,Nose piece fell off and lost the screw.,51499,3
51499,"As far as looks and comfort, both are five stars.",51499,3
51499,Durability is where the review gets docked.,51499,3
51499,I bought a three pack of these so maybe the other two will have a little better longevity.,51499,3
51500,does not look like in the picture on Amazon.,51500,3
51500,I doubt it will survive to even one washing cycle.,51500,3
51500,"If it does, it can be used everyday on a jeans...nothing more!",51500,3
51501,Nothing but problems ordering these shoes.,51501,3
51501,Twice i ordered them and got the wrong color and the third time the color was right but was orangey and not red as expected.,51501,3
51502,Hard to use because of elastic closure.,51502,3
51503,"Cute swimsuit, but the top was very loose fitting (couldn't tighten the band enough to make it so it wasn't too loose around.",51503,3
51503,DO NOT play volleyball while wearing.,51503,3
51503,The cup size and the bikini bottom fit just right.,51503,3
51505,I have to keep my hand constantly on top of the hat if I don't want it blowing off in the wind.,51505,3
51506,The red wasn't as it appeared online.,51506,3
51506,"The shoes were very cute though, but I returned them because it wasn't red I expected - like it was a little more orangey red than blood red if that makes sense.",51506,3
51507,I'm wearing this dress for a wedding next month.,51507,3
51507,"I'm 5'8"" and 36D, and typically wear a size 8.",51507,3
51507,"I ordered the size 10 in early June, but I've gained a bit of weight in the chest and now have problems zipping up the back of the dress.",51507,3
51507,"I just ordered the size 12, and it is EVEN SMALLER than the 10.",51507,3
51507,The lining underneath is so snug that it won't even pull down flat over my hips.,51507,3
51507,I'm going to try a size 14 instead and hold on to the size 10 in the meantime.,51507,3
51507,"It's a beautiful dress and flattering, but you have to have a lot of time to find your right size.",51507,3
51507,"Also, the dress will most definitely be too long, so factor in tailoring costs as well.",51507,3
51508,"The color is not as shown in the picture, it is a much lighter blue and very flimsy looking.",51508,3
51508,The clasp and finishes are very flimsy and I will have to be very careful wearing it.,51508,3
51508,"But for the price, it's a good deal.",51508,3
51509,"Socks were nice but they were supposed to be wide calf, definitely more on the narrow side.",51509,3
51509,And not much stretch in the leg at all.,51509,3
51510,"I wanted to like this, but it seemed to irritate my skin.",51510,3
51510,Took it out a not even 8 hours later and never put it back in.,51510,3
51511,This isn't one size fits all it kinda small and im only a size 3. its snug around the underarm area.,51511,3
51512,Color was on point but size chart was off,51512,3
51513,Half of the glasses have a burr on the nose pad that I couldn't break off.,51513,3
51513,I'll have to buy  something like an X-Acto knife to try and cut it off so I can wear them.,51513,3
51514,These yoga leggings are just okay.,51514,3
51514,"They are super cheap, and can go in the dryer, but the waist isn't very comfortable.",51514,3
51514,"I am in between an XS and a S, neither one of them fit just right.",51514,3
51514,The fabric is moisture-wicking but really thick for hot yoga.,51514,3
51514,I would recommend the Yoga Reflex ones instead for a few more $.,51514,3
51515,cute but too BIG,51515,3
51516,It is worthless to get one use.,51516,3
51517,I think these items are always going to be better than they actually are.,51517,3
51517,"Clearly made for teeny-framed women, multiple loose ends that need to be cut, and has a zipper on the hood that's of no use.",51517,3
51518,its way larger and baggy then my size.,51518,3
51518,"I usually wear a medium dress, I bought a small and its still very large on me.",51518,3
51519,I ordered the extra large for my 17 yr. old who has broad shoulders and this would come closer to fitting me and I'm a small in womens.,51519,3
51519,Although he loved the fairy tale symbol on it this may have to go back.,51519,3
51521,It was nice but large was cut too small,51521,3
51522,Not what I  expected  but  will fit five cards  plus  my driver's  license,51522,3
51523,"But slightly rougher than expected, also i didn't notice they were ankle socks.",51523,3
51523,But they're thin and super durable so good for summer.,51523,3
51523,Glad i bought them.,51523,3
51524,"The shade of blue in the ad is a chambray color, but the actual color is more navy.",51524,3
51524,It isn't what I expected.,51524,3
51524,"The 'denim' is shiny, too much polyester.",51524,3
51524,"On the up side, it is nice and long for a tall person like me.",51524,3
51525,"Adorable, but too large.",51525,3
51525,Don't fit into them yet.,51525,3
51526,for me they were to big...might work for someone else just not me.,51526,3
51526,I did like the color though.,51526,3
51527,Not the quality I expected.,51527,3
51527,Too much trouble to return.,51527,3
51527,Maybe my young niece can use it.,51527,3
51528,Cute and my Acer chrome book fits well.,51528,3
51528,Wish it had a carrying handle though.,51528,3
51529,The quality of the bag was great and the leather looked genuine.,51529,3
51529,"After a month or so of use, however, one of the rings attaching the handle to the bag broke, rendering it useless.",51529,3
51529,I was sad to have to send it back!,51529,3
51530,"This like the bracelet is not what I call red to mr it's orange, my aunt loved the bracelet ans she will love the bracelet.",51530,3
51531,"If you are over a size 6, I would not get these",51531,3
51532,product runs very small,51532,3
51533,"I will have to pay someone to alter it, other wise it's ok",51533,3
51534,"Workmanship was as expected
3.",51534,3
51534,"Eye padding is helpful

Cons:
1.",51534,3
51534,"A little on the thin side but plastic quality was okay...a little better than cheap Halloween masks
2.",51534,3
51534,"More expensive than it should be, but then again, it is ""Star Wars"" merchandise
3.",51534,3
51534,"Masks may be a little small for larger adults

Conclusion: Basically, something to just have fun with...Not a bad item for a party or photo booth; should last for a couple of events; not designed for serious costume wearer.",51534,3
51535,they are bigger than like but nicely made.,51535,3
51536,"Fits very small, collar is short",51536,3
51537,Unhappy with the material that the jacket is made of.,51537,3
51537,It feels very cheap.,51537,3
51538,would be helpful if they added a conversion size chart.,51538,3
51538,I ordered my size 38C it fit nowhere.,51538,3
51539,The ring is nicely made.,51539,3
51539,It's the classic design and it's very shiny.,51539,3
51539,From the pictures posted by customers it looks very good.,51539,3
51539,I personally like a heavy band and I found it in other store.,51539,3
51540,Cute shoes but size was.off.,51540,3
51541,To small around the arm pits rubs and caused sours,51541,3
51543,Item was as shown jus small,51543,3
51544,Since my upper body is shorter than my bottom my mom had to pinch up an inch on the shoulder part to fit me perfectly.,51544,3
51544,Other than that this dress is really worth the price.,51544,3
51545,"I like the way this robe envelops you, over the neck, down to the ankles, and with a lush over spaciousness around the chest and waist.",51545,3
51545,It absorbs water well: you can throw it on after the shower and yet it's ample enough to drink up water so that you don't feel you're in a wet rug.,51545,3
51545,"It washed well the first time, and shrinkage seemed to be minimal; there was a lot of lint, but that's probably normal, and I haven't yet noticed the loose threads that other reviewers have noted.",51545,3
51545,"Also, the belt is most definitely not too short; indeed, it's long enough to throw into a loose knot with some inches to spare.",51545,3
51545,"The only drawback, surprisingly, is that this large robe is not especially dense or heavy; if robes were ranked like coats, this would be a spring/autumn one, not winter, since it just isn't heavy enough, even with that built-in muff around the neck, to keep you warm in a cool house.",51545,3
51545,"A note on cost:  At $53, this was just outside my budget, and I bought it only reluctantly; at best, it is worth this price.",51545,3
51545,"After purchase, but before this review, the price exploded to $64, and it simply is NOT worth it.",51545,3
51545,"Buy below $55, but avoid at any higher price.",51545,3
51546,I didn't realize their were clovers on this veil- they look cheesy.,51546,3
51546,I pulled them off and it worked fine for first communion.,51546,3
51547,"Do not go by the measurements , this is SMALL.",51547,3
51547,The only reason I am giving any stars its because it's pretty.,51547,3
51547,"Only buy if you a SMALL, otherwise it won't fit.",51547,3
51548,These board shorts have a great pattern on them and are a very nice color.,51548,3
51548,The problem is that they are not cut for the bigger man.,51548,3
51548,They gather in the crotch area making them unable to have a flow to their fit.,51548,3
51549,"I loved them, but they fit my hubby too tightly for him to actually wear.",51549,3
51550,poorly made- from cloth material to stitches.,51550,3
51550,"we just need it for a pictorial, if only i don't need it by tom i would definitely return this.",51550,3
51550,even though not the best quality atleast it served its purpose.,51550,3
51550,"we received a lot of comment, little sailor :)",51550,3
51551,"The pasties were fine, but the boobs sag your real boobs, dosnt push boobs up at all",51551,3
51552,"The material is spandex-y, similar to workout leggings.",51552,3
51552,Also they back is almost awkwardly longer than the front.,51552,3
51552,"It is, however, very comfortable to wear for the summer and not bad looking.",51552,3
51553,Better off as a sleeping shirt.,51553,3
51553,"Looking back I don't know why I purchased, it's too large but who knows what my aesthetic will be in the months to come.",51553,3
51554,I have a big head and one size fits doesn't,51554,3
51555,its ok but expensive,51555,3
51556,Cute but I did not expect it to be hollow on the other side!,51556,3
51556,Pictures don't reflect that at all.,51556,3
51557,"Very pretty, but bows fall off clips very easily.",51557,3
51557,Need to be glued better.,51557,3
51558,Buckle is hard to open!,51558,3
51559,"LOVE IT, my son said it looks like pink and chome , I was happy with the true size, details and sturdiness !",51559,3
51559,THEN a week later the center stone came out,51559,3
51560,This was a gift and was sent to someone else.,51560,3
51560,Did not get to see it,51560,3
51561,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the chest area is a bit tight but, the rest of the dress is a little big.",51561,3
51561,I do like the dress tho.,51561,3
51561,Maybe I can let out the chest area and take in the waist.,51561,3
51562,Received all solid colors - none of the cute patterns/designs shown.,51562,3
51563,"Beautiful dress,  but the wire that forms the frills at the bottom of the dress was falling out in the parking lot before the dance.",51563,3
51563,Had to cut it and knot it to keep it from unraveling the whole skirt.,51563,3
51565,The bottom ran small and the top fit awkward.,51565,3
51565,I will revisit this next summer and see if I like it more.,51565,3
51565,The top did not give the support I needed.,51565,3
51566,It's a cheap material and very see through.,51566,3
51566,But it is cute with a tank underneath.,51566,3
51567,Fit as expected but didn't do much to make my shoes less slippery.,51567,3
51568,Dress had a little too much flare in the skirt for me and top was a little snug.,51568,3
51568,"Overall, a pretty decent dress for a fancy dinner or wedding.",51568,3
51569,Not exactly what I expected.,51569,3
51570,"Very cute and it does block the sun, but my son's head is soaked after wearing it for any short period of time.",51570,3
51570,I mean May/June weather is warm but nothing compared to the upcoming months.,51570,3
51570,"I doubt my newborn will be wearing this much this summer, unfortunately.",51570,3
51571,"Color changed, silver tarnished, charm fell off",51571,3
51572,Metal pieces on straps fell off 1st wash.,51572,3
51573,I wanted to wait to write this review to give fjackets a chance to respond to my concerns.,51573,3
51573,The Pros: It is a kind of nice vest and well made even if it is a slight bit tight.,51573,3
51573,I love vests and have about 10 different ones that I wear all the time and the XL fits just right with just a touch of belly room.,51573,3
51573,This vest leaves no room so I would recommend going up on size if you plan on leaving it zipped while eating.,51573,3
51573,"If you are looking for an exact replica of Chris Pratts vest, this is not it.",51573,3
51573,The most obvious change is the height of the zipper compared to the pockets.,51573,3
51573,But there are about 6 discrepancies I found.,51573,3
51573,"Pockets are for decoration only as they are too small for anything other than a pack of gum
  3.",51573,3
51573,You can get the exact same vest for cheaper from Jacket Fans and save yourself $57.00.,51573,3
51573,"When I called this to the attention of Fjackets, I was promptly (they responded to my email very quickly) told they would refund the difference between their vest and the one sold by other company however that was on May 11, 2016.",51573,3
51573,"I was very impressed with their response, however it is now July 3rd and the refund still hasn't happened so I will give fjackes a ONE star and the vest a 3 star.",51573,3
51574,"after feeling a YOW pain repeatedly in my foot, which sent me to the doctor I saw that my options included granny shoes or inserts.",51574,3
51574,I am NOT giving up my collection of ankle boots.,51574,3
51574,So inserts it is!,51574,3
51574,"I've now tried very expensive customs inserts, these powerstep jobbies and $10cvs brand inserts.",51574,3
51574,My favorites are the cvs arch supports .,51574,3
51574,"the $35 power steps may last longer, but they don't work any better.",51574,3
51574,I'm on my feel a LOT and walk a LOT,51574,3
51575,"this is a tapestry, not a beach towel or anything of that sort.",51575,3
51575,I use it as a light blanket lol,51575,3
51576,No tummy control and not has flattering as I'd had hoped it would be.,51576,3
51576,I like the back straps as it makes this suit more modern.,51576,3
51576,Not much bra support.,51576,3
51577,Was indifferent to this product.,51577,3
51577,Annoyed that one pair had a hole in the behind.,51577,3
51577,"Wanted to ship back, but it was going to cost me and figured it wasn't worth the hassle.",51577,3
51578,This bathing suit looks so cute but I bought slightly larger than normal and couldn't even get it over my thighs.,51578,3
51578,"I am 5'7"" and 125lbs so I bought a medium.",51578,3
51578,It has no stretch to the fabric so I didn't even bother trying to get it on all the way.,51578,3
51578,"The material is very sturdy and it looks like it would fit great, be supportive and last a while but the fit runs way smaller than expected.",51578,3
51581,"These worked great for Halloween, but they were strangely made at the top with a huge crotch area, and almost no elastic in the waistband.",51581,3
51581,I had to wear a pair of short running shorts over them to make them stay up and not creep down to my knees as the day went on.,51581,3
51582,Very cute shirt but it does run a size or two sizes to small.,51582,3
51582,I used to be a size 6 but have lost weight & am down to like a size 4 so this shirt in the size 6 fit me perfectly.,51582,3
51583,"Quite a bit shorter than expected, esp for a plus size item.",51583,3
51583,Otherwise a nice light layering item.,51583,3
51584,"It's okay, nothing special.",51584,3
51584,The straps are hard to figure out how to fasten.,51584,3
51585,Not what I expected when received.,51585,3
51585,Ran 2-3 sizes small.,51585,3
51587,too large and too long,51587,3
51588,"I liked the look of the pants, however they were to small and I could barely get them on they were so tight.",51588,3
51588,I will be returning them.,51588,3
51589,"Super cute design but WAAAAY too small for my 34 DDD's...and this was the ""XL"" size I ordered.",51589,3
51589,There is no way you can make this work on a large breasted woman (sometimes spilling out of a top is preferred when being used for fun) but this will in no way fit anything more than a C cup.,51589,3
51590,Miss read the info on this item.,51590,3
51590,Too much money for one charm,51590,3
51591,They're pretty crappy quality,51591,3
51592,"These are great looking Capris I wore them twice for only a few hours and I found a 1/2"" inch hole in the seam on the inside of the left legal am disappointed as I really loved the color scheme,  will mend them but won't ever be the same.",51592,3
51593,This runs VERY small...,51593,3
51593,I wear a M-L top and I ordered an XL and it was very small.,51593,3
51593,The sides are cut very high just in case anyone wasn't aware.,51593,3
51593,"Very comfortable and cute, just wasn't what I was looking for!",51593,3
51594,Two of the four I ordered have ripped,51594,3
51595,I ordered this mat since I was moving to a smaller desk and couldn't use my old gaming mat.,51595,3
51595,I went on Amazon and saw that this mat was only 30 inches in length and thought that it would be perfect since I was down-sizing.,51595,3
51595,"However, that was not the case.",51595,3
51595,"When I opened up the package and put it on my desk, the mat looked a little longer than 30 inches so I measured it.",51595,3
51595,"Despite being advertised as 30 inches in length on Amazon, the mat I received was actually 35 inches in length.",51595,3
51595,This is weird since another user complained that the mat they received was only 30 inches.,51595,3
51595,"Since I couldn't use the mat, I had to return it.",51595,3
51595,Buying this item seems like it is a waste of time since the manufacturer cannot get the mat to be measured the right length.,51595,3
51595,I do not recommend this mouse pad whether you want a 30 inch or 35 inch because you might get the one that you don't want.,51595,3
51595,"Aside from the sizing error, the mouse pad does look okay.",51595,3
51595,The quality isn't the greatest and seems like it should only be priced at about $5-10 and not the full $16.,51595,3
51597,Fell apart in 2 weeks.,51597,3
51598,Shirt is really cute and seems well made but I ordered a SIZE 5 and they sent a 5T.,51598,3
51598,"Buyers beware, I think all sizes are toddler sizes.",51598,3
51599,Theu fit good but were not dark wash like shown in picture.,51599,3
51600,Be careful not to trim too much.,51600,3
51600,"The insert should have a line for each size , so you can trim accurately and does not !",51600,3
51600,I trimmed my inserts a little too short !,51600,3
51601,The size chart is accurate.,51601,3
51601,The material is as expected for the price you are paying.,51601,3
51602,Bought this to go inside my large Longchamp.,51602,3
51602,Fit well with room on every side to fit additional things (sometimes I carry papers or my iPad with me).,51602,3
51602,"But once I removed something larger inside the main pocket the insert, the whole thing would collapse (this could be different in a bag that maintains its shape, like a LV Neverfull).",51602,3
51602,The amount of pockets sounds great but when you've got so much stuff in it the other pockets can be hard to access.,51602,3
51602,Not even sure how the zipper pockets would be useful.,51602,3
51602,I wish there was an affordable felt-box style that wasn't going to cost me 2/3 the price of my actual bag.,51602,3
51602,I did a lot of searching for a perfect price and 2 for $12.xx seemed great - I figured I could use one for travel.,51602,3
51602,But was disappointed when one of them was received damaged and clearly quick cuts to the threads.,51602,3
51602,I know that a lot of people have complained about these falling apart quickly - so I opted to return them as I don't want them to deteriorate faster then they already might.,51602,3

51603,When this shirt arrived I thought it was a mistake.,51603,3
51603,It is toddler sized.,51603,3
51603,My daughter loves it anyway and STRETCHES it to get into it.,51603,3
51603,"However, she's tall and very skinny.",51603,3
51603,Even with that I'm surprised she can even get it over her head.,51603,3
51603,"My daughter loves the print, but I'm not sure how long this very small shirt will fit her.",51603,3
51605,i ordered 2 ans one broke,51605,3
51606,I like the earrings but it will start hurting when you wear it for long period.,51606,3
51608,But I I don't like how it smells-strong!,51608,3
51609,"Nice PJs, but the two pairs I got both had seam failures within the first month of use.",51609,3
51609,"I can sew them up, but I shouldn't have to fix almost brand new PJs.",51609,3
51609,The seam failed at the crotch where the leg joins.,51609,3
51610,I must have a longer torso because the top was a little short and didn't fit how I wanted it to even though I sized up (I am 5'6').,51610,3
51610,I wish the halter was adjustable like the back.,51610,3
51610,It's still very pretty though so I am considering just cutting the neck straps and extending them with ribbon.,51610,3
51611,"First off I am 5'7"", 165 pounds and I ordered a large.",51611,3
51611,The size is huge which is fine as its meant to be oversized but its too short to wear as a tunic because it rides up and even pulled down isn't quite long enough but its too long and oversized to work well qs just a top.,51611,3
51611,"About 4"" longer would of been perfect and it would of made a great tunic.",51611,3
51611,"The pros are that the style is cute and a lil unusual, kind of modern and the material while a bit thin is super soft and comfy.",51611,3
51611,It appears to be well made for the inexpensive price point and I've decided to keep for around the house and maybe I'll figure out a way to wear it I haven't thought of yet.,51611,3
51611,"It really is made very large but short, if you're over 5'3"" I would suggest sizing down at least one size to wear as a top and it'll still be loose.",51611,3
51611,"I'm sad this didn't quite work as I wanted it because it would of been amazing as a cozy, soft tunic with leggings for running around with the kids since it feels like great pajamas while still being stylish.",51611,3
51611,If they come out with a version long enough for an American I would love to repurchase.,51611,3
51612,It seemed like good quality but fell apart after about four months.,51612,3
51612,"Oh well, it didn't cost much.",51612,3
51613,"A little bigger than what we thought, but still ok.",51613,3
51613,It was delivered the first week of September and a pin has fallen out already.,51613,3
51614,"It feels great, but the cold seems to stick to it.",51614,3
51614,It didn't warm my legs like I expected.,51614,3
51615,Sized for a child.,51615,3
51616,Great quality shoe and color.,51616,3
51616,Only complaint is the back of my son's foot had blisters from how stiff the shoe was and it was difficult to break them in.,51616,3
51616,"Other than that, great product.",51616,3
51617,"Cute idea but looks a little cheap... if my 9 year old doesn't like it, then it must look super cheap... she said it's nothing special about it and it smells funny... returning.",51617,3
51617,"Ideally, I purchased it for myself but it wasn't a need for it...",51617,3
51618,Mine did not come in a box as shown on picture (or mentioned in other reviews).,51618,3
51618,"So far, I have worn it twice: a little tricky to get on symmetrically at first, but it does stay on just fine once you get it right.",51618,3
51619,The description is not accurated,51619,3
51620,The brushes are tiny should  have been bigger.,51620,3
51621,Love the idea and style but some of the stones were not there and they are hard to keep upright.,51621,3
51621,Definitely cute and worth the price though.,51621,3
51622,"It fits your butt into the holes, however don't expect to lift the butt up.",51622,3
51622,Your butt shape will most likely to look the same shape after wearing it and it looks really awkward if you wear a normal undergarment inside too.,51622,3
51623,It seems to be a decent quality underwear.,51623,3
51623,"Have just started trying one pair out , so do not know how it will do after being washed yet.",51623,3
51624,"it fits nice but the bottom was 1"" short from the back and some of my crack was showing, wasn't working for me",51624,3
51625,Not wrong with the item.,51625,3
51625,Fits as I thought it would.,51625,3
51625,Only problem I had no when I breathe hard it tends to fog up my glasses.,51625,3
51625,I guess it just need a breathing hole....,51625,3
51626,These are small compared to other brands of toddler size 2 undies.,51626,3
51626,My son is only 25% percentile weight for his age and they were too tight on him.,51626,3
51626,"Other than that, the craftsmanship is good.",51626,3
51626,I was going to buy a larger size to replace but found that Osh Kosh B'Gosh makes better ones with wider waistband which are exactly like men's underwear.,51626,3
51626,They are more comfortable for my son because it doesn't cut into his waist.,51626,3
51627,The burgundy color was way more of a crimson red.,51627,3
51627,Liked the light weight fabric and length but color was way off.,51627,3
51628,beautiful but broke after a few wears :(,51628,3
51629,"The style is great, but thin, and the quality wasn't so great either.",51629,3
51629,The biggest problem I had with the shirt was that in the photo it looks casual but in person it looks like something I would wear to work not out on a walk in the park or date.,51629,3
51631,"Silver wears off, but for the price...",51631,3
51632,I didn't realize the front and back are like 2 separate panels attached by the shoulders,51632,3
51633,Fit as expected but looks much more artificial and synthetic in person.,51633,3
51633,Wouldn't way this on my child,51633,3
51634,"I wear a 7 5/8"" hat.",51634,3
51634,This is a tight fit,51634,3
51635,Much more pink flesh tone than tan and there was a hole in it where the binding did not catch under the stitching.,51635,3
51636,The fabric of the shirt is like a jersey- not cotton or a poly/cotton blend like I was thinking it would be.,51636,3
51636,"And the lettering seems slightly blurred not crisp/ sharp--
Plus the fit was somewhat small; I would've preferred a looser fit.",51636,3
51636,"I wore it once , and probably won't wear it again",51636,3
51637,Made of polyester instead of cotton.,51637,3
51637,The t-shirt that match the pants are two different blacks,51637,3
51638,Got this for my Mother and thought it would be on the small size but it isn't.,51638,3
51638,It looks cheap and is bigger then what you would think.,51638,3
51639,"The boot appears to fit true-to-size, but the shaft is very tall for a small kiddo.",51639,3
51639,I had to return them because my daughter couldn't easily walk in them.,51639,3
51641,"A bit smaller than I expected, but still wearable.",51641,3
51641,Biggest problem was walking in it; had to leave the bottom open so I could mince along on my two little feet like a geisha girl.,51641,3
51642,Gave to my nieces that are 11 it was too small for me very pretty wish it worked.,51642,3
51642,They love and cannot wait to wear when it gets cooler.,51642,3
51643,"Very pretty dress, but I had to return one which was a real pain dealing with China!",51643,3
51643,Had to order two sizes up.,51643,3
51643,The beads on collar and back fall off extremely easy just  handling the dress.,51643,3
51643,It is  gorgeous dress though.,51643,3
51643,Wearing it for my wedding,51643,3
51644,Fits smaller than expected.,51644,3
51645,I do not know that I received these!,51645,3
51646,I'm a little thick on the lower half so I probably should have ordered a size or two up as this was pretty much a tunic or long shirt on me.,51646,3
51646,With leggings or a pair of skinny jeans it's not bad.,51646,3
51646,It's cute but definitely smaller than expected.,51646,3
51647,"The beads come off in rows, don't try it on too many times, and don't buy it with the expectation of wearing it multiple times!",51647,3
51648,I probably should have ordered one size smaller,51648,3
51650,The top section would be better if a zipper or elastic for better form fitting,51650,3
51652,Cute but material feels really cheap,51652,3
51653,It's tight across the abdomen but so long that goes to the knees and actually looks like a dress.,51653,3
51653,I wasn't sure if I should post it as if it's too small or if it's too large.,51653,3
51654,The sizes are not what they supose to be.,51654,3
51655,The white is VERY see through so be prepared.,51655,3
51655,I am 5'11 and 180 pounds the large fit well but a bit of stretching made it more comfortable as the day went on.,51655,3
51655,Ultimately I did order it in another color because I was pretty pleased with it.,51655,3
51656,very cute but both pieces do not fit accurate to sizing.,51656,3
51656,I'm average sized and bottoms fit but top was entirely too large and my body is pretty proportionate,51656,3
51657,I really liked the look of the swimming suit and I really like the cover.,51657,3
51657,The thing I didn't like about the swimsuit is that the straps were really big for my little girl.,51657,3
51657,I had to tie them at the top and the front was still sinking low.,51657,3
51658,Good quality - a bit large but wearable!,51658,3
51660,I don't really understand why the circle beads arts centered.,51660,3
51661,Material is nice but it wasn't what i was looking for.,51661,3
51661,I ordered a Large based on reviews saying to size up but i should have stuck with my own size which is Medium.,51661,3
51661,Well now i have to return.,51661,3
51662,They are adorable and warm but way too large for my 6 month olds feet.,51662,3
51662,The fall off immediately after putting them on,51662,3
51663,love the look of this top.,51663,3
51663,I got a lot of compliments on it but...it needs work on the flowers.,51663,3
51663,I had to re-knot all of the single flowers because there was nothing to keep it from unraveling.,51663,3
51664,These tights are exactly what is stated.,51664,3
51664,They are warm and soft.,51664,3
51665,I wear size 6 and it fits me well.,51665,3
51665,The colors are nice and bright as show on the picture.,51665,3
51665,"However, the fabric is rather thin and shows the color of your underwear.",51665,3
51665,"Overall, it is reasonable quality for the price.",51665,3
51667,They're very soft and comfortable but after the first wash the waist band gets all twisted and weird.,51667,3
51667,They're a little long as well but since I'm 5'9 it works out great for me.,51667,3
51668,LOVE THE COLORS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE THOUUGH,51668,3
51669,Its a solidly made charm.,51669,3
51669,"I only have one complaint, which is pretty big.",51669,3
51669,There's not much oxidation on it (the black) to make the letters and designs pop out.,51669,3
51669,So all you see is a silver looking type angel wing shaped blob unless you look very very closely.,51669,3
51669,"Other than that, it got here quickly and packaging was good.",51669,3
51670,"Price is good, you get what you pay for",51670,3
51671,Three star rating for a couple of reasons.,51671,3
51671,"The color tones are very vibrant, too vibrant for my taste.",51671,3
51671,"Secondly, the stitching was such that there was a strange lump on the front of the dress.",51671,3
51671,My wife is trim and petite and this dress made it look as though she was trying to hide a large paunch.,51671,3
51671,We had hoped this dress would appear more elegant than it does.,51671,3
51671,Simply a very casual piece perhaps best suited for teen and post-teens.,51671,3
51672,Not true to size....,51672,3
51673,Material very nice and soft.,51673,3
51673,I where a large comfortably.,51673,3
51673,But this top is a bit tight.,51673,3
51673,Not enough stretch to it.,51673,3
51674,It fell out while I sleeping :( and my hole closed up,51674,3
51675,"The suit is cute, but it covers more skin on the model than what it does in real life.",51675,3
51675,"It is good quality, but if you have any amount of chest you will be showing more than picture.",51675,3
51675,"Also, if you have a rounder behind it exposes more as well.",51675,3
51676,suppose to be Black looked grayish gave it away looked kinda cheap.,51676,3
51677,i hope this shrinks because right now it is very long and spacious,51677,3
51678,Overall ok but the size was a little small.,51678,3
51678,I guess it will stretch out to size in the long run.,51678,3
51678,Next time I will be a size up,51678,3
51679,These arrived in the colors pictured exactly.,51679,3
51679,The thumb hole is a little tight as mentioned in other reviews.,51679,3
51679,My daughter is average size and 2 years old.,51679,3
51679,They are nice and thick and she kept them on longer than any mitten so far.,51679,3
51681,Not what it shows in the picture,51681,3
51682,"Good product, but made for people with big feet and skinny ankles!",51682,3
51684,I like this jacket but the fit is slightly off and I'm not a fan of the shoulder pads because of my small frame.,51684,3
51684,I love the color though and still think it's very cute.,51684,3
51685,The bag arrived as expected and is great quality.,51685,3
51685,However the excessive number of emails asking for a review were quite frustrating (2-5 in a single day?!),51685,3
51685,and i don't know that i would order from this store again.,51685,3
51686,A bit big for my newborns hands so we'll use them as he grows.,51686,3
51687,Hat quality is what I expected from Flexfit.,51687,3
51687,"Size was actually too large, which was totally unexpected.",51687,3
51687,I typically where the L/XL Flexfit hat and need to break it in/stretch it out before it is truly comfortable.,51687,3
51687,The XXL felt like it was at least two to three sizes bigger than the L/XL.,51687,3
51689,Good looking but cheaply made and the bridge is QUITE wide.,51689,3
51689,But for the price they are ok.,51689,3
51690,It's too big for my head but I do have a small head.,51690,3
51690,Might be better for big headed people.,51690,3
51691,Made nice for the price .,51691,3
51691,They were pretty small .,51691,3
51692,Don't get them wet if you want them to last.,51692,3
51692,Or maybe polish it with clear polish.,51692,3
51692,My fingers are small an I wanted these to be in my mid finger area not the whole thing.,51692,3
51693,"This is a really cute outfit, but the top is really small.",51693,3
51693,"If you're bigger than a B cup, it may not fit!",51693,3
51694,"Serves the purpose, but a bit large for dollhouse interior.",51694,3
51694,It arrived bent as it was only packaged in a plastic bag and must have been knocked around during shippingstill can't make it perfectly straight but it is fine.,51694,3
51695,Chain is hard to clasp together,51695,3
51696,"Cute hat, well made, but huge on my average size head.",51696,3
51696,Wont be wearing much!,51696,3
51697,"Says women's, more like kids small!",51697,3
51698,BEAUTIFUL DRESS JUST DIDNT FIT THE WAY I EXPECTED,51698,3
51699,Soft and warm socks but they don't have enough elastic in them or something and they don't stay up.,51699,3
51700,"Had to exchange for next size up, sizes run a little small.",51700,3
51700,"Top was horrible, gf ended up just throwing it away and purchased a different top.",51700,3
51700,Held no support whatsoever.,51700,3
51700,"Bottoms are great, though, gf mixes it with a bunch of different tops.",51700,3
51701,My droid turbo 2 didn't fit.,51701,3
51701,Quality?- ice only had it for a week.,51701,3
51701,I will be back to let you know.,51701,3
51701,So far just meh.,51701,3
51702,The top was way to small the bottom perfect,51702,3
51703,I'm usually a size small/medium and I'm 5'8 so I went up to a large and it rides up horribly..,51703,3
51703,I can't even sit down.,51703,3
51703,So sad bc it is really cute and well made... just not for taller girls.,51703,3
51704,Bottom was alot shorter than expected.,51704,3
51704,Ordered a size up fit pretty good.,51704,3
51705,"I purchased these without any discount so this is a non basis review

Do not use these in sneakers or tennis shoes they are only designed to be used in flat soled shoes like converse or vans.",51705,3
51705,Given that the fit is at times uncomfortable.,51705,3
51705,Squeezing the toe section of the shoe forcing your toes tightly against one another.,51705,3
51705,I used these on a pair of vans I have and after a half day of use I ended up with a nice blister on my heel.,51705,3
51705,After switching back to shoe strings I had no problems.,51705,3
51705,So be warned they are snug fitting and you cannot use them in multiple shoe types only flat soled like vans or converse.,51705,3
51706,I find them to thick for my shoes.,51706,3
51706,I am  trying them in an old pair of running shoes since they are to clunky for all of my other shoes.,51706,3
51706,I hope I will get to like them better!,51706,3
51707,Not exactly what I expected but I liked it enough to keep it I guess.,51707,3
51708,The neckline of this dress felt like it was choking me.,51708,3
51708,The straps in crisscross in the back very high.,51708,3
51708,I would have needed to order 2 sizes bigger for this dress to be comfortable.,51708,3
51708,The rest of the dress fits true to size.,51708,3
51708,Seeing is decent except for the straps crossing at the neckline.,51708,3
51709,Disappointed with the low quality printing,51709,3
51710,A little tight around the legs but otherwise great!,51710,3
51712,It's a bit small for my head.,51712,3
51712,Its narrow build is also odd,51712,3
51713,It looked great and it is not BAD quality.,51713,3
51713,But the fabric has NO STRETCH whatsoever.,51713,3
51713,So maybe get a size or two up because the sleeves were super tight as well as the neck.,51713,3
51713,And it was a bit short.,51713,3
51714,These socks are nice because they are light.,51714,3
51714,"However, the sticky dots came off after only a few uses in Pure Barre classes.",51714,3
51715,I measured based on the instructions and it is too small.,51715,3
51715,It seems good quality but useless for me.,51715,3
51716,I'm torn between a 3 and 4 for this one.,51716,3
51716,It's cute and fits fine.,51716,3
51716,"It's just VERY thin material, so it looks cheap and shows a lot.",51716,3
51716,I guess it's what you plan to use it for that matters.,51716,3
51716,"It's not nice enough to wear out really, but around the house or exercising/dancing/casual activities it's ok.",51716,3
51717,As someone who cycles I loved the idea of this shirt but ultimately can't get behind it.,51717,3
51717,I have several similar tops that I use to run in without the pockets and they wick away sweat so much better.,51717,3
51717,Combine that with the lined and droopy back pockets are awkward and make my back sweat with minimal physical effort and I'll stick with my other cycling tops.,51717,3
51718,Took a long time to ship and felt different from my other beanies from diamond.,51718,3
51720,I bought these for myself because I have somewhat small feet for an adult.,51720,3
51720,I wear a womens size 6.5 (US).,51720,3
51720,So I thought these would fit just a little bit big since they are a 7.,51720,3
51720,I should have looked at the sizing chart a little more closely because a Big Kid size 7 is about a womens size 9!,51720,3
51720,So I obviously can't wear sandals 3 sizes to big and had to return them.,51720,3
51720,Now I'm very disappointed because they don't offer this pattern in my size at all.,51720,3
51720,":( I highly recommend printing out the ""Kids shoe fit guide"" to measure before buying.",51720,3
51721,I did not care for the collar otherwise a very nice sweater.,51721,3
51722,"Okay, so the shirt is cute.",51722,3
51722,"The fabric is comfy, but it runs small.",51722,3
51722,"So if you want it roomy, go a couple sizes bigger.",51722,3
51723,This is a nicely made product.,51723,3
51723,But the gloves are huge.,51723,3
51723,They fit me as an adult there's no way they will fit a child.,51723,3
51724,Love it but I'm just a Lil to much curvy for this,51724,3
51726,smells like fish :(,51726,3
51727,This item is VER Y light weight and that makes it difficult to keep the watch with band on top of the light source.,51727,3
51727,It also plugs in to the computer not a wall socket.,51727,3
51727,Both would be more useful.,51727,3
51728,Wife says they fit a little small but a great deal and nice color options,51728,3
51729,This was such a cute bathing suit.,51729,3
51729,I'm 5'8 & 132 lbs.,51729,3
51729,cup size is 36DD.,51729,3
51729,The XL top is waaaaay too small.,51729,3
51729,& the bottoms were waaaaay too small.,51729,3
51729,"I would have just bought bottoms in the smaller size but if the XL won't cover by breasts, there's no winning for me.",51729,3
51730,Like fit & colors but found one that was a defectively sewn had to throw it out couldn't be worn.,51730,3
51730,Not sure I would reorder,51730,3
51731,works good for a swimsuit cover-up but wouldn't wear it away from the water.,51731,3
51731,It is lined with swimsuit liner but it doesn't go all the way down - on me the liner is just barely long enough to cover my small butt.,51731,3
51731,it kind of looks odd because it isn't long enough so you see where the liner ends.,51731,3
51732,These were nice while they lasted but I think I only got three wears out of them and then i got a small snag in the thin tummy material and the next time I put them on there was a huge run all the way down the front.,51732,3
51733,Really like these leggings!,51733,3
51734,I like the glasses although it was missing a screw on one of the nose pieces no big deal I was able to find a glasses kit to fix it.,51734,3
51735,I got this to hold hair ties.,51735,3
51735,"It's a nice bracelet, but the hair ties don't stay on it very well.",51735,3
51735,I wouldn't recommend buying it for that reason.,51735,3
51736,I washed this gown in antisipation of needing this gown soon.,51736,3
51736,In one wash and being hang dried it developed a whole.,51736,3
51736,It has not even been worn yet!,51736,3
51736,Unless a quick try on counts.,51736,3
51736,Will put a cute patch on it and still use it but if you purchase I highly recommend had was.,51736,3
51736,I only need it to last for one use and the rest seems to hold together.,51736,3
51736,I am glad I will not need to use a hospital gown!,51736,3
51736,It is nice and soft and has a very practical design.,51736,3
51737,Not sure if the leather strap at the back is actually leather as described.,51737,3
51737,There is a plastic feel to it.,51737,3
51739,bit narrow in the front (for those with wide feet);had to replace bottom outer sole;cork area warping;very cute but cheaply made,51739,3
51740,"It is cute, but too small.",51740,3
51740,"Purchased for my two year old, doesn't reach her ears.",51740,3
51741,"THIS  IS  A  TEST for me, looks can be deceiving.",51741,3
51741,Not all bad but i just don't like the material.,51741,3
51742,Have to ship back.,51742,3
51743,The look is good but the material of the interior is cheap and probably not durable.,51743,3
51743,This item should be made thinner and the material of better quality.,51743,3
51744,Sizes run MEGA small...,51744,3
51744,I got an XL and it fits like a medium.,51744,3
51744,Other than the sizing issue its cute.,51744,3
51745,Good bag..larger than I thought...needs inner bottom.,51745,3
51746,Ive ordered this 3 times and each time got a slightly different product.,51746,3
51746,Sometimes thinner material sometimes thicher recently shirts came with white ck logo on bottom which was nice tough but I expect consistency,51746,3
51747,"I love the style but I have big hips and when I wear it buttoned, I have to leave the last two buttons undone because its very snug on my hips.",51747,3
51748,The tiara is beautiful but very heavy.,51748,3
51748,The comb broke when I first tried it on and the pins that came included could not hold the tiara on my head because it's so heavy.,51748,3
51748,I even tried tying it with strong ribbon but still too heavy.,51748,3
51748,I used it as a decoration for my party.,51748,3
51749,I like the dress but it is too large.,51749,3
51749,"It is supposed to be baggy, but not a sack.",51749,3
51750,The international sizing charts are not standard.,51750,3
51750,"The EU size was not compatible in Central America, where I sent them as a birthday gift.",51750,3
51750,"As a result, my grandson is not able to use them, because they are too small.",51750,3
51750,Overall quality is OK.,51750,3
51750,They will make an adequate hand-me-down gift to one of my younger grandsons.,51750,3
51751,Runs at least one size too big,51751,3
51752,"I bought this skirt in a size small for my medium height, very skinny 8 year old.",51752,3
51752,She had to fold it over once at the top but otherwise it fit her great.,51752,3
51752,"The skirt is very cute, however, upon arrival it had a small hole in the front.",51752,3
51752,We need it for a Bell Choir performance that is tomorrow so I am just going to have to try and patch it rather than send it back for a new one.,51752,3
51752,I find it very frustrating that a brand new skirt comes with a hole in it.,51752,3
51754,It's a pretty ring but unfortunately it was missing a stone and turned my finger green.,51754,3
51755,"Try 3 travel organizers, 2 pouches with ""secret pouch"" written on them and the world's smallest laundry bag.",51755,3
51755,So 7 travel cubes isn't what you're really getting,51755,3
51756,"The embroidery is very nice, but this ""one size"" item is a size small.",51756,3
51757,"It is totally beautiful, but a little small.",51757,3
51757,"I am a 10 and I got an XXL, because of my large breast and the belly and hips are just fitting me.",51757,3
51758,Good but not as much as the picture,51758,3
51759,I order an small size and it looks pretty big..I a waiting for a couple of months to see of it fits better,51759,3
51761,It was to small,51761,3
51762,Unfortunately you have to order the same size top and bottom... so either I'm not proportionate or Lovewhitewolf models are not proportionate.,51762,3
51762,I ordered a Medium- the bottoms fit perfect but the top is too big.,51762,3
51762,"Unfortunately, when the top is too big there is nothing you can do because there is no way to tighten the top through the back (where the bra strap would be).",51762,3
51762,I wear a 4/6 bottoms and I am a 34 B.,51762,3
51762,That being said if you wear my size neither the S or M will work out.,51762,3
51763,"As cute as this is, my partner wore it for a few hours and it ripped near the crotch area.",51763,3
51763,"Now, I know he might be a mess and frolicky, but for what I paid, I expected it to last AT LEAST one dance party.",51763,3
51763,"It is rather cute and he got a lot of compliments, but Umbreon has no time for rips when he's getting turnt, mkay.",51763,3
51764,"Product took along time to ship, but it was exactly as described.",51764,3
51765,THE SMASHED HAT LOOKS LIKE A BURRITO WITHOUT SALSA,51765,3
51766,"The jacket is a tight fit, even with ordering a size up.",51766,3
51766,It also is shorter than expected; it stops above the hip and the material of the jacket is eh.,51766,3
51766,"For the price, though, it is not worth it (in my opinion).",51766,3
51767,same brand is sold at Mandee stores.,51767,3
51767,I am a size small or xs in most tops but this brand I normally buy a medium.,51767,3
51767,I purchased a small and after one wash its very tight.,51767,3
51768,I liked the blouse but it was plainer than what I thought,51768,3
51769,"Cute, but way too small.",51769,3
51769,I ordered two different sizes and neither fit.,51769,3
51769,"5'8, 150 lbs and extra large was too small.",51769,3
51770,Theres a zipper on the side i didn't see it and i got stuck trying it on lol,51770,3
51771,Very beautiful but does not fit.,51771,3
51771,Also the top of the dress is not as light as it appears.,51771,3
51771,It's heavier in person and definitely feels like it while on.,51771,3
51772,If you are over a B-cup bra you may want to reconsider this dress.,51772,3
51772,"The waist fit and length were good but my ""goodies"" were falling out of it, and since it was for a corporate function, I was unable to wear it.",51772,3
51773,I like the gloves.,51773,3
51774,"First things first, the print is beautiful.",51774,3
51774,This dress would be lovely if there were actual size ranges.,51774,3
51774,"I am aware that it is made keeping Asian sizes in mind, but there are exactly 3 inches of fabric above the waist.",51774,3
51774,"So if you have anything larger than an A cup, you will look like a joke in it.",51774,3
51774,"I bought a green fabric and replaced the bust with a customized design, and it is still extremely pretty, but it would have been nice if I didn't have to go through this much trouble.",51774,3
51774,Dear makers: women have breasts!,51774,3
51774,And busty women also like wearing pretty dresses!,51774,3
51775,It's not as sturdy as the picture appears.,51775,3
51776,My fault that I did not see it was 100% cotton and NOT PRE-SHRUNK.,51776,3
51776,It still fits ok but not as well as when it came out of the package.,51776,3
51776,Also being 100% cotton it does require a lot of ironing.,51776,3
51777,"I did not like the material, it was also too small.",51777,3
51777,I actually seen this on someone in person however with a much smaller frame and it looked nice on that person.,51777,3
51778,"The appearance is nice, not stunning while the band looks solid and durable, but lack weight and sound like braze aluminum scraps grassing one another while handling it.",51778,3
51778,Overall the turbillion wheel accented in gold does the gold tachometer bezel around the Quartz very well.,51778,3
51778,"The exposed inner-clock-working mechanism is beautiful, along with the exposed rear Quartz.",51778,3
51778,It's what I'll call a collectors now & then watch.,51778,3
51779,good shirt but runs small,51779,3
51781,Somewhat big to be a cartilage earring.,51781,3
51781,I didn't like it.,51781,3
51782,"I hoped for a bit of an oversized look for this sweater, but it almost stuck to my skin.",51782,3
51782,"In addition, it's very uncomfortable and not really good quality...",51782,3
51783,This product falls apart too easily!,51783,3
51783,I only wore it 1 time and it fell apart.,51783,3
51784,Ok quality but there is a seam sewn in down the middle of the sole which is quite uncomfortable.,51784,3
51785,I was a little disappointed with this bracelet.,51785,3
51785,It wasn't as well made as similar ones I have ordered in the past.,51785,3
51785,It is loose and floppy.,51785,3
51785,Even when it is adjusted all the way.,51785,3
51786,"Cute but runs big...5'5"" 129lbs",51786,3
51787,I ordered my size but need a size larger but the product looks good and the material feels good and soft.,51787,3
51788,They so not fit true to size.,51788,3
51789,"For a low budget cosplay, this is what you want.",51789,3
51789,Its not screen accurate though.,51789,3
51789,The actual belt is pretty thick and well made.,51789,3
51789,The pouch are good quality as well but a tad bigger than expected.,51789,3
51789,Eventually I may just mod the pouches to be smaller and airbrush them for a better look or something,51789,3
51790,I ordered a medium but it fits a size 13 or 14.,51790,3
51790,I wear a size 5.,51790,3
51790,Way too big for me.,51790,3
51790,Material is very thin and see through.,51790,3
51790,Perfect for a humid southern summer.,51790,3
51791,"Very sparkly, but pretty small.",51791,3
51791,I also thought the color would be darker.,51791,3
51791,"I bought these with the intent that they would compliment ""Ocean Blue Earth World Globe Charm"".",51791,3
51791,"Instead, the color wasn't as vivid as expected.",51791,3
51793,the gray isn't really a clean gray.,51793,3
51793,it has a bit of a dingy tan to it and looks a little dirty (ISNT ACTUALLY DIRTY) just looks it.,51793,3
51793,the fabric has some stretch to it but not much so if you have larger breasts the top fits tighter and more sports bra-ish than lounge-comfortable.,51793,3
51793,the straps annoy me but i'm a little anal about it when they aren't flat in their knit.,51793,3
51793,but that is just a personal thing.,51793,3
51794,The adhesive is just ok.,51794,3
51794,It helps that you don't put moisturizer on before you apply but if you get a little hot and start to ptespire it feel loose.,51794,3
51795,"The shirt fabric is thin, and I bought it larger than I needed, the medium fits like a large.",51795,3
51796,"True to size, it is just very thin with no padding.",51796,3
51796,More of a body suit.,51796,3
51797,Sizing not like industry standard.,51797,3
51797,Nice fabric and very well made though.,51797,3
51798,It is pretty much what it looks like in the picture just made of cheap fabric,51798,3
51799,needs to be longer in the torso.,51799,3
51799,I am 5'10 and it is just too short,51799,3
51800,Great product but don't see why it's so expensive.,51800,3
51801,Too small and I'm a smaller size adult.,51801,3
51801,I'm not sure it would even fit a child's head.,51801,3
51801,The wig is nice for the price but totally useless to me.,51801,3
51802,I loved it but it ripped first time wearing it :-(,51802,3
51803,Did not fit well my daughter's body type,51803,3
51804,"Cute but it didn't glow..
 After week outside in the Texas son",51804,3
51805,I had no intention of wearing this outside in public anyway which is good because it's not flattering at all.,51805,3
51805,I bought it to wear inside the house when it gets chilly but it's not warm at all.,51805,3
51805,It's very thin and lightweight so it doesn't really keep me as warm as other sweatshirts or a sweater does.,51805,3
51805,It does shrink when you wash and dry it too.,51805,3
51805,Even the arm length shrank and it wasn't that long to begin with.,51805,3
51805,I'm short with short arms and normally have to roll up sleeves but these sleeves were a good length for me.,51805,3
51805,That probably explains why the model in the picture has the sleeves rolled up.,51805,3
51805,I bet she has longer arms.,51805,3
51806,The hat is okay.,51806,3
51806,Has a large brim and can be tied on.,51806,3
51806,The large floppy brim can make it difficult for a toddler to see and be annoying to them when it keeps getting in their eyes.,51806,3
51807,"The frames were larger than I was expecting, and the fit was awful (felt like they would slid right off of my face)",51807,3
51810,"Works well, but purchased a similar one that is RFID protected.",51810,3
51810,Other than that a good buy,51810,3
51811,Was not the color in the picture,51811,3
51812,Cheaply made but still pretty.,51812,3
51812,Don't like how lace attaches to sleeves at the top.,51812,3
51813,Touch portions are not great.,51813,3
51813,Can't use pattern lock with them.,51813,3
51814,You pay for what you get.,51814,3
51814,It was fun for a while.,51814,3
51814,But got dirty easily where no other case I've used has ever done.,51814,3
51814,"It stayed intact and did it's job, but was wearing out under my heavy use.",51814,3
51815,Nice chain but links are made out of plastic and snap easy but very nice to the eye,51815,3
51817,"i like the way they are made and the feel, but the waistline has no give at all the legs have plenty of give and stretch but not the waist no give at all very disappointed in product, other than that they are beautiful made panties (really strange because a couple pair actually do have stretch)",51817,3
51818,Would definitely shrink in washer.,51818,3
51818,As expected for something this price,51818,3
51819,Has some small discoloration by the buttons.,51819,3
51819,I only bought it to take a few photos of my friend in.,51819,3
51819,Good thing it was cheap.,51819,3
51820,I really wanted to love this necklace.,51820,3
51820,It really looked cute!,51820,3
51820,"Unfortunately, one of the main flowers was only partially painted and silver metal showed through where it should have been purple.",51820,3
51820,"Also, the cord wrapped around the chain made it look cheap.",51820,3
51821,"Some of it fit perfectly while others kinda tight, was okay for the price considering It was a 4 pc set",51821,3
51822,Construction not as durable as one would hope.,51822,3
51822,Holdup Suspenders are for some reason much higher quality then this product.,51822,3
51823,"Quality was better than expected,  but make sure you check the measurements.",51823,3
51824,"Did not fit my husband, who has a 38"" chest and usually wears a size medium shirt - he was absolutely swimming in this shirt in size small, it was gigantic and very square in construction.",51824,3
51824,"If you are not overweight, you probably won't like this shirt, it's definitely not a modern or slim fit.",51824,3
51824,"This fabric wrinkles very easily, as well.",51824,3
51824,"The colors are very vibrant, however, and the design is nice.",51824,3
51825,"Took forever to get here, its nice but a little short in length AND I'm size 24 waist.",51825,3
51825,They really should have sizes.,51825,3
51826,Order up a size if you don't want it to be tight,51826,3
51827,"okay, so based off the price and the quicker than expected delivery, not a bad purchase.",51827,3
51827,the material is also thicker than expected which is nice since the back is so low I don't have to worry about wearing a bra with it.,51827,3
51827,"(if you're shy about nipples showing in the slightest you definitely will have to though) with that being said, the purchase arrives with thread hanging off on it in multiple spots, as well as a rip on the shoulder.",51827,3
51827,"I'm nervous to wear it because I don't want it to stretch and rip even more, or completely rip, revealing that I'm not wearing a bra.",51827,3
51827,"it's also a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which I should've seen coming knowing where it was being shipped from.",51827,3
51827,sizes are always smaller.,51827,3
51827,"but I'm 5' 120lbs and I ordered a small, though I should've gotten a medium.",51827,3
51827,it fits but is a little uncomfortable in some spots.,51827,3
51827,"I knew it would ride up since it's a thong style, but it leaves a little bulge on my lower back (because there is a bit of extra material) and it rides up really bad.",51827,3
51827,"the leg holes are also ridiculously high, they go up to the bottom of my waist making it difficult to find a good pairing with it.",51827,3
51827,"a nice high rise skirts looks good, but low rise jeans or regular shorts look very funny.",51827,3
51827,even some of my high waisted shorts are not quite high enough.,51827,3
51827,so all in all it was a decent purchase for a cheap price.,51827,3
51827,I just really wish I hadn't received mine with a rip in the shoulder.,51827,3
51827,"I don't want to have to wait through the process of sending it back to receive a new one, so I guess I'll have to be extremely cautious when wearing to avoid more tearing (ha ha rhyming is fun)",51827,3
51828,but it was still beautiful,51828,3
51829,But order at least one size up as it is quite small,51829,3
51830,These are cute but the arm is very fragile and it broke off already,51830,3
51831,"Cute, but you get what you pay for.",51831,3
51831,"I love the idea of this product, but you can tell it is inexpensive.",51831,3
51831,The cut out heart is uneven and it looks like it is dirty.,51831,3
51831,I can't complain too much because I didn't expect it to be high quality.,51831,3
51831,"It is still something I will wear, and I love the idea behind it.",51831,3
51832,Rly loose on my daughters hand,51832,3
51833,I purchased it for a gift.,51833,3
51833,I wish the leather was a bit thicker.,51833,3
51834,It is the Union Jack if the Union Jack suddenly incorporated pink in place of the red.,51834,3
51834,Wouldn't purchase this product again.,51834,3
51835,"Loved the fabric and the design, but was disappointed when I tried them on my son.",51835,3
51835,"I got a 12month size, but they fit like his 9 month sleepers that didn't fit him any more, especially the feet.",51835,3
51836,"Nice quality but when loaded with 8 credit card type cards, some cash, some business cards, it's pretty fat.",51836,3
51837,"Logo was off center a little bit,",51837,3
51838,Waaay smaller than i would like.,51838,3
51838,Its a beautiful purse,51838,3
51839,I have to give it a three because the sizing is horribly off.,51839,3
51839,I wear about a 10 and had to get a xxl.,51839,3
51839,It's still a bit snug but it will work.,51839,3
51839,Aside from that it's beautiful.,51839,3
51839,The price makes it well worth it and I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day.,51839,3
51839,I'm already married but my husband and I didn't have the time or money for a wedding so for Christmas I purchased a private wedding package for us!,51839,3
51839,I will add wedding photos in a couple weeks :),51839,3
51840,The actual bars come exactly as pictured.,51840,3
51840,The only problem is the width of the bar is too tiny.,51840,3
51840,It makes the piercing uncomfortable.,51840,3
51841,"They are a little bit large than I expected, and thicker to.",51841,3
51841,Not so cute as seen in the picture.,51841,3
51842,"I normally have loved my Sock It To Me purchases, but the very first time I wore these they ended up with a hole in them.",51842,3
51842,Seems the fabric on these socks is thinner than my other purchases.,51842,3
51842,Still loved the design and hoping I can sew up the hole to get some more use out of them.,51842,3
51842,Just not sure they'll hold up well at all.,51842,3
51843,the top was really big around with little breast coverage.,51843,3
51843,the bottoms were super cute if you want to show off your booty a little!,51843,3
51843,worth the cheap purchase for the bottoms i can pair with a plane black top.,51843,3
51845,Liked the product but gave to some one else instead of who I purchased it for.,51845,3
51845,The sizes run a lot smaller.,51845,3
51846,"Looks as pictured, fits a little weird, Bill seems subpar/flimsy, arrived promptly from seller",51846,3
51847,"It's all good, just a little on the thin side!",51847,3
51847,Fits awkwardly on the body.,51847,3
51847,I think because they're SO LONG.,51847,3
51847,But I have a long torso and usually can't find ones that fit right!,51847,3
51848,Three stars according to Amazon means 'it's okay'...,51848,3
51848,"If you don't mind the color, the price makes this a great little pin.",51848,3
51848,"However, the color is too orangey for me.",51848,3
51848,I tried to find some standard red things to photograph so you can decide yourself.,51848,3
51848,Another drawback is the edges are pretty sharp on top.,51848,3
51848,"If I were keeping it, I'd take a metal file to it.",51848,3
51848,"It is well made, and the color does look baked in as described.",51848,3
51848,"It's nice and shiny, and the pin on the back is durable.",51848,3
51848,I think it would last a long time and not fall off.,51848,3
51849,"I'm 5'0"" and weigh 112 lbs, and normally wear a US petite S/M,  Since other reviews have suggested this top tends to run on the larger size, I decided to risk it and order an XS.",51849,3
51849,The shirt is definitely still too large and loose and looks more shapeless than in the photos for me.,51849,3
51849,"Also it's at that awkward length where it's too short to work comfortably as a dress but long enough to cover my shorts, though I was sort of expecting that due to my height.",51849,3
51849,"I'm not overly disappointed, though, because the fabric is soft and light for the summer and it's not hideous or anything, so it's still great to wear casually or when you're just bumming around indoors.",51849,3
51850,The sack under the penis not big enough.,51850,3
51851,The style of this poncho is very cute but it is oversized.,51851,3
51851,I had read previous reviews about it being large so I ordered a size down.,51851,3
51851,"Unfortunately, it is just sloppy big.",51851,3
51851,I ordered a 14/16 but it is probably a good 3 sizes bigger.,51851,3
51851,The quality of the poncho itself is nice.,51851,3
51851,There wasn't any problem with the fringe at the bottom.,51851,3
51851,I will be returning this product due to sizing.,51851,3
51852,The XL is a weird fit.,51852,3
51852,Its wide and short.,51852,3
51853,Way too small..get 2 sizes bigger..,51853,3
51854,The outfit was exactly like the picture.,51854,3
51854,The cut of the outfit was small.,51854,3
51854,You should 2 sizes bigger for a comfortable fit.,51854,3

51856,Fabric is just ok.,51856,3
51856,Runs a little small.,51856,3
51857,Hat is too small or my 5 years old has big head.,51857,3
51857,Gloves are too big.,51857,3
51858,"I ordered this to wear over a swimsuit, which is what it's supposed to be for.",51858,3
51858,"While it is very pretty and feminine, it is more appropriate for wearing to bed, than over a swimsuit.",51858,3
51859,Not really it broke and I love the color,51859,3
51860,Nice dress but the material is very light and the white part is see tru!,51860,3
51860,I ordered XXL and its a bit too large for me,51860,3
51861,I bought this shoes for my son.,51861,3
51861,He's starting to wear size 7 but this boots where not the actual size they mentioned.,51861,3
51861,Just a hint they will run small.,51861,3
51862,Thin with sharp edges.,51862,3
51862,Had to wrap the handle area with tape to avoid hands hurting.,51862,3
51863,The stone does not look green at all.,51863,3
51863,It appears clear in color.,51863,3
51864,I have only worn this item once..... it fits tight in the stomach part.,51864,3
51865,"Would last a wear or two, not the worst quality, but only for cheap costumes.",51865,3
51866,sizing runs a little small,51866,3
51867,Fit was ok for my 12 year old.,51867,3
51867,They were a little loose but I expected that.,51867,3
51867,The stitching seems a little cheap.,51867,3
51868,Quick shipping but the fabric is yellowing in some areas.,51868,3
51869,The size was great.,51869,3
51869,The fabric is nice and soft cotton.,51869,3
51869,The stitching isn't the best.,51869,3
51869,Within 2 hours he had a small hole in the crotch.,51869,3
51869,Overall we are satisfied.,51869,3
51870,"I like it, but the lace is to delicate, the buttons are not good quality.",51870,3
51871,"They run small,  not nearly as good as I thought,  I should've returned them when I could .",51871,3
51872,Bought a large for my mother who is a medium and it still looked small.,51872,3
51874,"When I first got it I thought it looked too small but it does fit, not tightly either.",51874,3
51874,It is a bit thinner than I thought but it still feels like a beach towel only softer which is what I wanted.,51874,3
51874,"I am between a size 14 and 16 pants right now, it depends on the brand if that helps on the sizing.",51874,3
51875,I like the hat but it too small .,51875,3
51876,Fell right off my shoulders.,51876,3
51877,"Not the best quality, but doesnt look super cheap, for the price is actually good, cant ask for much.",51877,3
51877,The top was not well made.,51877,3
51877,"If you are normally a S, get a M. If you fine yourself in between a S and a M, get a M, trust me.",51877,3
51877,"Same as if you are a M, get a L and so on and so far.",51877,3
51878,It's OK the fabric is kinda cheap.,51878,3
51880,Some workout leggings are flattering and suck everything in ...,51880,3
51880,These are not those.,51880,3
51881,Looks a little cheap,51881,3
51882,I normally wear M fit or slim shirt.,51882,3
51882,These are bit tight around the chest.,51882,3
51883,"Unlike many reviewers here, I actually purchased this full price and not through a product code service.",51883,3
51883,"I am 5' 4"" 105lbs and 33-24-35.",51883,3
51883,"I thought the size S would fit based on previous reviews, but I'm sad to report it didn't.",51883,3
51883,It was much too large.,51883,3
51883,"Also, the color of the ""Taupe"" dress was not as depicted in the photos.",51883,3
51883,"It was lighter and greyish, and very drab.",51883,3
51883,"The material was thick and high quality, but this also made the seams very stiff and created weird lines where they were sewn.",51883,3
51884,Way to small even with the measurements.,51884,3
51884,It's super cute though and good quality,51884,3
51885,I had to return this dress unfortunately.,51885,3
51885,The top (gold part) was too small and the bottom (black part) was entirely too big.,51885,3
51885,The dress is very nice and made of nice material.,51885,3
51885,It just didn't fit properly.,51885,3
51886,I love the dress and got many compliments.,51886,3
51886,Except it came without the belt.,51886,3
51886,I had to run the store to find something to go with it and spend even more money.,51886,3
51887,Looks amazing but it is much to small.,51887,3
51888,"I am 5""4' and the body was definitely not long enough!",51888,3
51889,I really want this shirt to fit me better.,51889,3
51889,It is too large and the hole in the front sits very awkwardly and doesn't look quite right.,51889,3
51889,"That being said, the material is nice and I love the color.",51889,3
51889,I might try one in an even smaller size and see how that works for me.,51889,3
51890,The shirt itself is very gorgous.,51890,3
51890,The hem is extremly pretty.,51890,3
51890,Unfortunly it very tight.,51890,3
51890,The arms are quite tight.,51890,3
51890,The shirt itself is very thin.,51890,3
51890,If folded it gets krinkled easily.,51890,3
51890,Shipping came as expected and in perfect shape.,51890,3
51890,"If you buy this product, I strongly recommend 2 sizes above your origanial, unless you want a belly shirt.",51890,3
51890,";) Besides that, perfect for the Summer.",51890,3
51891,Cute But WAY TO BIG,51891,3
51892,It is good I like it.,51892,3
51893,kinda cheesey but didn't pay a bunch...so its ok,51893,3
51894,It is beautiful but my door lost it twice.,51894,3
51895,The colors are not varied to the extent as shown in the picture.,51895,3
51895,"The product arrived intact, no missing stones, however the stones are all a bright/royal blue, None of the sky blue.and those 'white' stones are actually inlay rhinestones.",51895,3
51895,"If I hold the necklace up to the light, I can see that different types/paints were used on what was to be the lighter sky-blue intended stones, but in 'normal' light, they're just swirls in the same blue as the rest.",51895,3
51895,"Not a high dollar expense, and my expectations were not high, but I do want what I order to arrive looking like the picture.",51895,3
51895,"If you're looking for a royal blue necklace with a few rhinestone embedded accents, this works.",51895,3
51895,"I'll give it an OK, but what I really wanted was the versatility of different blue colors that unfortunately I didn't get,",51895,3
51896,Mine were too tight and so were my mothers:( we are built very differently..,51896,3
51896,They otherwise very nice looking shirts:),51896,3
51897,I love the suit from the front it's great but I have a huge gap in the back where it's not flush I have to get it altered.,51897,3
51897,But the material is good quality.,51897,3
51898,Small and extra long.,51898,3
51898,I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I usually would and the fit was almost perfect but very long.,51898,3
51898,"I am only 5' 2"".",51898,3
51898,It came down almost to my knees until I washed and dried it.,51898,3
51899,"Very high waisted, not at all what was expected",51899,3
51900,I had read where others said that the sizes ran smaller so i ordered a larger size and it was way too big.,51900,3
51900,Had it actually been the right size and not falling off me i would have loved it!,51900,3
51901,I expected it to look better.,51901,3
51901,Its v wrinkled upon arrival n when u put it on its more baggy than i thought  I havenot decided yet if i should return it or not,51901,3
51902,Much smaller than I thought it would be,51902,3
51903,not as maxi - more of a tube skirt,51903,3
51904,I love the fabric and cut of the shirt  it it is a tad small can't dry it for fear of ahrinking,51904,3
51905,"The colors are great on this top, very vibrant.",51905,3
51905,"Fits a little short, other that that great swim top!",51905,3
51906,It is a size smaller than the usual standards in US.,51906,3
51906,"Material is good ... Would help if it was a little more stretchy
Quality of material was good",51906,3
51907,"This looks like a great suit, but when it was packaged the bra cups were folded, and it left a permanent crease in the foam cups.",51907,3
51907,Nothing I did could vet the crease out.,51907,3
51907,You can't iron it because it would melt this type of fabric.,51907,3
51907,I wore it despite the weird cup creases.,51907,3
51907,It's cute and fits well.,51907,3
51907,I went to Hawaii and swam int eh ocean as well as some water falls.,51907,3
51907,The suit got grimy and dirty.,51907,3
51907,I've washed it 3 times but nothing seems to get it clean.,51907,3
51907,"I feel like this looks cute, but it can't handle much wear and tear.",51907,3
51907,FYI the fit was fine.,51907,3
51907,I am 5'8'' and 122 lbs.,51907,3
51907,"I got a small because I have small boobs, and the bottoms were not a problem.",51907,3
51908,I ordered a 2X because I wear a 16 but figured they'd run small for the price - what I got was equivalent to a U.S. size 8 - 10.,51908,3
51908,"Given what it cost, the shirt's a good deal but they should be more accurate with their advertised sizes.",51908,3
51909,Truthfully these are rather good but they didn't fit properly and kept rolling down.,51909,3
51909,I also noticed that they do not stay up for long and need to stretch a lot to get your finger through the hole in the gloves.,51909,3
51909,I also thought they would be longer than they were.,51909,3
51909,"I had my own expectations so I am disappointed but the gloves are very good as far as quality, but they would have been better for someone with different expectations.",51909,3
51910,Just tight in the chest area.,51910,3
51911,The liner is too loose inside the jacket.,51911,3
51911,I keep pushing out the sleeve liners even with a cotton shirt.,51911,3
51911,Will be difficult with a sweater underneath.,51911,3
51912,"Cute barbells, but first of all these are EXTERNALLY threaded which is not ideal for any piercing.",51912,3
51912,The balls on this are larger than most which also means although technically the same length overall there is less space on the barbell.,51912,3
51912,Just barely large enough for me.,51912,3
51912,So sassy though and I love that.,51912,3
51913,"I was so excited to find this shirt with ruching, but the effect was completely ruined by the horizontal seam that runs below it.",51913,3
51913,"If the seam was not there, the shirt would have hung beautifully.",51913,3
51913,"Instead it created a ""sectioned"" look on my torso and emphasized my hips in a bad way.",51913,3
51913,The sleeves were a little snug too.,51913,3
51913,"Normally love Thanth, but this one missed the mark.",51913,3
51914,The pattern was beautiful as shown.,51914,3
51914,My husband's shirt fit just fine in the size I ordered which was extra large.,51914,3
51914,I had to send the whole set back because I ordered a medium dress and it was way too large.,51914,3
51914,I had to pay $13 to send the setback which I was not happy about that.,51914,3
51914,I like the pattern so much that I reordered a extra large shirt with a small dress.,51914,3
51914,"I received a shirt and dress and the dress was way too big, the same size as the medium.",51914,3
51914,"I was very unhappy with this but I kept it because it didn't come in an extra small dress, and I needed it for a Hawaiian themed party that was coming up.",51914,3
51914,I would have given 5 Stars if I didn't have the problem with the dress.,51914,3
51915,My fault I didn't read the description very well.,51915,3
51915,This is more like a wallet than a purse.,51915,3
51916,The dress fits perfectly everywhere but the chest area.,51916,3
51916,"The chest is WAY to small so I will definitely have to wear something underneath , not to mention it is incredibly see through so I'd have to wear a slip or something more side underneath.",51916,3
51916,I love the fabric and the way it fits everywhere under the breast area.,51916,3
51917,Fits a little small.,51917,3
51917,Material on shoulders is extremely itchy,51917,3
51918,"I love the design and ease of use, but it has one big problem.",51918,3
51918,I have not had the locket for long and the silver finish is already wearing off.,51918,3
51918,I imagine it is due to the essential oils.,51918,3
51918,It would be better to just make it in stainless steel or some finish that will not be worn off.,51918,3
51918,"I have not had this issue with the necklace that has the screw-on cover, but it is not nearly as convenient as the hinged latch cover that this necklace has.",51918,3
51919,Pretty shoes for special occasions.,51919,3
51919,My daughter wore these as a flower girl and they were lovely.,51919,3
51919,Unfortunately many rhinestones fell off during the day and we were left with the sharp prongs that originally held them in place.,51919,3
51919,They did the trick for the occasion.,51919,3
51919,She wore them one more time but now about half the stones are missing.,51919,3
51920,so much for no gaping in the waist!,51920,3
51921,i wish the photo showed the neckline.,51921,3
51921,I wish i could be more rounded.,51921,3
51922,Size is smaller than expected but great top,51922,3
51923,"Very warm jacket ,well made especially for price.",51923,3
51923,That being said only gave three stats because it's fluffy I thought from picture it would be more slim fitting it is not,51923,3
51925,"It's considerably bigger than I thought, it hung almost to my lip, my husband said it looked like I had a golden Hitler Stache.",51925,3
51926,My husband loved it.,51926,3
51926,I didn't like that the puzzle didn't fit like a puzzle and after one day off wear the paint faded off the black cross.,51926,3
51926,Still Bless and very appreciative.,51926,3
51926,"My husband waiting on the post man all day got a womp, womp,womppp.",51926,3
51927,bought it too small planning to resell it,51927,3
51928,Sizing is way too small.,51928,3
51929,"If you are expecting a darker gray like the picture, you will be disappointed.",51929,3
51929,It's very light gray.,51929,3
51930,There is a nice lining under the flowy outer dress.,51930,3
51930,"However, the fit is odd, and not very high quality.",51930,3
51931,The fabric for these pajamas is wonderfully soft and a nice warm weight.,51931,3
51931,"However, the fit was off for me.",51931,3
51931,"I am 5'6"", 145lb, and straight figured - I bought a large.",51931,3
51931,The pants were huge but the top was snug and short.,51931,3
51931,I wanted these to work so badly because they are 100% cotton and would be comfortable and breathable.,51931,3
51931,"But alas, I had to return them.",51931,3
51932,doest fit well though.,51932,3
51932,the string going across the chest doesn't do anything this swimsuit has no breast support at all.,51932,3
51932,If you're over a size B don't order this,51932,3
51933,"Cute bracelet, however, the ""wording"" is much smaller than it looks in the pic...",51933,3
51935,Smaller than it looks in the picture but a good product for the price,51935,3
51936,The badges could have been a 4 but green diamond badge had some tarnish staining on it.,51936,3
51936,I still gifted it but wasn't too pleased.,51936,3
51936,"Thankfully, the child still appreciated it and removed that badge.",51936,3
51936,The box magnet clasp does not close and the box feels a bit cheap.,51936,3
51936,Good idea and decently executed.,51936,3
51936,Probably will not buy any other sets.,51936,3
51937,This necklace looks like the ones they have in the dollar store.,51937,3
51938,Cute and fit as I expected.,51938,3
51938,"The top is a bit weird though, kind of feels like my boobs are on a shelf lol... great support I guess.",51938,3
51939,Doesnt hold alot withou zipper splitting,51939,3
51940,"It's more of a night gown, than a sun dress.",51940,3
51941,"Comes very small order 2 sizes bigger, very thin material.",51941,3
51941,I was lucky I reviewed the comments by others and ordered 2 sizes bigger.,51941,3
51942,Choose a size larger because it runs very small and sleeves are short.,51942,3
51942,Product ships from China so returns are not an option.,51942,3
51943,"Love the bracelet, but the color of the beads are off.",51943,3
51943,The clear beads have a blue hue to them.,51943,3
51944,Works n sticks on well but very very small!,51944,3
51944,I got a D cup as that's what I normally wear for bras n the measurements matched up but when I got it it only covers about 1/4 of my actual breats...,51944,3
51945,"It is a really cute billfold, however, the 2nd time I used it the clasp on the zipper to the change pouch came off.",51945,3
51946,"Comfy, but short in the crotch like others have said.",51946,3
51948,"Fit is fine, but kind of see through (I really liked the other 'normal' leggings I got from 90 Degree By Reflex 22 though)",51948,3
51949,nice dress but a bit tight for me....so returned.,51949,3
51950,Very hard to see the details.,51950,3
51951,Very thin plastic easy to break.,51951,3
51952,"Because the picture is so misleading, I assumed the bag was bigger than what I just received.",51952,3
51952,It's about the same size as any other cross body bag.,51952,3
51952,Disappointed when I saw that it wasn't as big of a bag as I thought it was going to be.,51952,3
51952,Overall though the leather is very soft so stars for that.,51952,3
51953,Material is comfortable but size is much smaller.,51953,3
51953,I ordered a xx and it was too tight.,51953,3
51953,Now I'm waiting for delivery of xxxx.,51953,3
51953,If it's too big I won't order any more,51953,3
51954,"Great Value, Great Quality, need a NEW size chart/conversion chart.",51954,3
51954,Clothes runs too small.,51954,3
51954,My children are average height and slim.,51954,3
51954,I ordered a size larger based on reviews and clothes were way too tight and small.,51954,3
51954,"Great value, cute, good quality just too small!",51954,3
51954,They need a new size/conversion chart.,51954,3
51954,I recommend buying at least 2 sizes larger.,51954,3
51954,"I will buy from seller as soon as they have stated they have a ""new"" size/conversion chart.",51954,3
51955,"I ordered this dress in two colors, both size small.",51955,3
51955,The black bohemian print fit perfectly (and I love it- super cute!),51955,3
51955,but the cream/olive dress was large up top.,51955,3
51955,"I am 5' 0"" and both dresses hit right below my ankles.",51955,3
51955,"For the cost, the material feels great- not flimsy or like it will fall apart in the wash.",51955,3
51956,The fabric felt pretty cheap and the it was pretty square.,51956,3
51956,Very little tailoring for the body.,51956,3
51957,We're sm for a 3T.,51957,3
51958,I normally wear a medium in most shirts.,51958,3
51958,"Got this in a large, assuming it would be tiny.",51958,3
51958,"It barely fits, but it fits.",51958,3
51958,"The shirt is pretty cute, but I was really surprised by the fabric.",51958,3
51958,Its kind of like the stuff halloween costumes and cheap bathing suits are made of.,51958,3
51958,Its shiny and not very opaque.,51958,3
51958,I doubt this would hold up in the wash.,51958,3
51958,If you are super small and only planning on wearing this for a special occasion then it will probably work.,51958,3
51959,Tight on the arms,51959,3
51960,The Image was on the back and I thought it was on the front.,51960,3
51960,Not what my wife was looking for.,51960,3
51961,One of the earrings was broken upon receipt...,51961,3
51961,"I went and bought lever backs and switched them out...other than that, excellent",51961,3
51962,This is a decent little suit.,51962,3
51962,The straps are kind of flimsy.,51962,3
51962,I got this on a Friday and by Sunday the strap seams were tearing.,51962,3
51962,All in all not bad though.,51962,3
51964,"It's a really cute tank, but it's really, really thin.",51964,3
51964,"When I put it on, I could see the bottom of my bra and my pants right through the shirt.",51964,3
51964,"Luckily the breast area isn't see through because of the built in bra, but you can see through every other part.",51964,3
51965,I red the reviews and to be safe i got a size large.,51965,3
51965,I am normally a medium.,51965,3
51965,"The bottoms

I read the reviews amd got a size bigger than normal.",51965,3
51965,I got a large and i am a medium.,51965,3
51965,The bottom are cute and work but for a large they fit me a little tight.,51965,3
51966,cute jacket but really small.,51966,3
51966,"Also, this is a light cotton jacket but not a heavier denim one.",51966,3
51967,Not exactly what I anticipated; different than advertised,51967,3
51968,A bit snug on the waste but overall not bad.,51968,3
51969,"This shirt is amazingly cute but way, way small.",51969,3
51969,I ordered two sizes larger than I normally wear & it's still way too small.,51969,3
51970,Got it for my 14 year old son .,51970,3
51970,it's nice .not in English so have no clue what it says,51970,3
51971,"The bag is pretty heavy without anything in it, probably due to the fabric type.",51971,3
51971,The zippers are cheap and do not easily close or open.,51971,3
51971,"Overall, it does the job by carrying my stuff, but I would not purchase again.",51971,3
51971,"For the price, you can find better options.",51971,3
51972,It is a beautiful design it just does not fit me.,51972,3
51972,The sizing chart is misleading and the other reviews were not really helpful in terms of size.,51972,3
51972,I am going to give it to my mother who will appreciate it a lot and it will definitely fit her if she is comfortable wearing it.,51972,3
51972,I got a medium but it is squarely in the large extra large category.,51972,3
51973,"Im 6'2"" and 175 lbs.",51973,3
51973,I read previous reviews that it runs small and they are right!,51973,3
51973,I ordered a XXL and it fits pretty good a little tight around the waist and arm length is plenty long.,51973,3
51973,My advice is to definitely hang dry after you wash.,51973,3
51973,However its a classic logo and the price is good!,51973,3
51974,I ordered two sizes up because I saw others' posts about it fitting very small.,51974,3
51974,"The material is very weird (definitely not cotton), and the shoulders are extremely poochy.",51974,3
51974,The pattern is cute but I would not order this again.,51974,3
51975,"Decent pairs of socks, but definitely have quality befitting their price.",51975,3
51975,"Start to pull apart quickly after a couple dozen wears, and as soon as you have a single snag anywhere on the bottom they split open.",51975,3
51975,Nowhere near the quality of thicker socks from the big names.,51975,3
51976,Tried to use as a traveling makeup bag but it doesn't fit a lot .,51976,3
51976,Only use if you pack light on the makeup.,51976,3
51976,Great material and cute design just doesn't fit my needs.,51976,3
51977,"The pockets are way too small, serve no purpose.",51977,3
51979,"My Grandson loves these shoes, that's why I gave 3 stars (It's ok).",51979,3
51979,"Although he hasn't had them that long (a couple months), they are already coming apart.",51979,3
51979,"Not happy with the ""Made in China"" workmanship.",51979,3
51979,The sewing is already coming out on the top.,51979,3
51979,Expected them to last longer then that.,51979,3
51979,That gets a 2 star.,51979,3
51980,One of the pins was broken sent it back,51980,3
51981,Gems sit too high for the ring I wanted to pair this with.,51981,3
51982,Fabric don't Look as expected.,51982,3
51982,Very Short and small.,51982,3
51983,the look is great.,51983,3
51983,but the fiber is a little rough.,51983,3
51983,you will need to buy 1 side bigger than your normal size.,51983,3
51984,too small in armpit area for me,51984,3
51985,The material seems to be good but it's way too small...,51985,3
51986,Very cute and very high quality but not as comfortable as I had hoped.,51986,3
51987,Bice slim design but doesn't hold many cards.,51987,3
51987,Awesome for the simple man ;),51987,3
51988,"Definitely a cute dress, but not something to wear to super nice events.",51988,3
51988,The material is a cool stretchy fabric and the fit is nice!,51988,3
51988,The inside of the dress is white though as opposed to black.,51988,3
51988,"It doesn't sit as tight on the waist as in the product photo, but it has a decent flare out.",51988,3
51988,Good for parties and costumes!,51988,3
51988,"Overall it's a nice dress, but just know what you're looking for.",51988,3
51989,I normally wear a small/medium and I bought a large because of reviews and it fits like a small.,51989,3
51989,I love the design of shirt but wish it was different material.,51989,3
51989,It is a spandex and it has snags already.,51989,3
51990,"Quality is great , but the picture makes them look way prettier then they are , I do wear them, sometimes; they are a bit darker though, then I like.",51990,3
51991,"Thin, runs 2-3 sized small.",51991,3
51992,Like it its so cute and fits my baby,51992,3
51993,I love these two necklaces.,51993,3
51993,I thought they would be bigger and not so hallow but I love them,51993,3
51994,i needed this to wear to my grandson's basketball games (school colors are black and yellow).,51994,3
51994,goes great with my shirt.,51994,3
51995,The sewing on the front of the shirt makes it impossible to fall correctly into place.,51995,3
51995,I had to reconstruct it and sew things to my liking.,51995,3
51996,Very nice but run much too small!,51996,3
51998,I loved the bathing suit.,51998,3
51998,the stripe sui .,51998,3
51998,perfect on the bottom.,51998,3
51998,somewhat large on top.,51998,3
51998,does not fit the breast part right.,51998,3
51998,loose on that area.,51998,3
51998,the retro suit was perfect perfect perfec .,51998,3
51999,Sizes run too small,51999,3
52000,Okay but not great,52000,3
52001,Texture changed completely after washing.,52001,3
52001,Probably should've dry cleaned it.,52001,3
52001,It was cheap so not a huge deal.,52001,3
52002,collar and buttons was off center.,52002,3
52002,short more of a tunic,52002,3
52003,I wear a size 7 3/8 hat.,52003,3
52003,I would have liked the Mask bigger.,52003,3
52003,It is kid of tight on my head.,52003,3
52003,Now some people did like smell of the Mask.,52003,3
52003,It does have a strong old motor oil smell.,52003,3
52003,They need to fix that.,52003,3
52003,Maybe that is why the price is cheap.,52003,3
52003,I washed mine with dishwater soap and that helped somewhat.,52003,3
52004,Took a while to get here but it starts to fade a little too quick for me,52004,3
52005,"It's cute but it's a lot darker than the picture shows and it is definitely not an 18"" chain.",52005,3
52006,I didn't buy this as a CCW bag and I don't think it would be handy for that purpose unless very little else was in it.,52006,3
52006,"I asked specifically about the ""hair-on"" portion and was told it was ""genuine"" although other parts were ""PU"" leather.",52006,3
52006,"There's not a hair anywhere, and a faint fragrance is the only hint of genuine leather.",52006,3
52006,"I like the looks and I'll get used to it, I think.",52006,3
52006,The exterior side pockets are useless.,52006,3
52006,The little flaps are sewn on in such a manner as to interfere with sliding anything out once it's inside.,52006,3
52006,The pocket itself is so snug that it might hold a couple of business cards but little else.,52006,3
52006,"The interior pockets are adequate and zippered; I added small straps because the ""handles"" on two of the zippers are very small and unhandy.",52006,3
52006,"I like that there's a zipper for the overall bag, but wish it was anchored so I could close it with one hand instead of requiring both.",52006,3
52006,"Made in China, it's an attractive bag of a nice size.",52006,3
52007,Neat shirt but Large is more like a medium,52007,3
52008,Nice shirt but it runs small.,52008,3
52008,I had to give it to my daughter.,52008,3
52008,She seems to enjoy it.,52008,3
52009,"I like these tops, but have a difficult time finding a bra with a low enough back to wear with them.",52009,3
52011,"It came in reeeaaallly early, but the bottoms were too small and I got some bigger than what I wear.",52011,3
52012,Bigger dial than expected.,52012,3
52013,I bought it because I liked the look of it.,52013,3
52013,"But tack pins are used instead of a bar pin to secure it, not one pin but two!",52013,3
52013,"Tack pin caps are easily lost, so I removed them and replaced them with a bar pin.",52013,3
52013,"So, if you are like me and don't want to chase around the tack pin cap, a little work fixes it up quite nicely.",52013,3
52014,it was a good deal looked real,52014,3
52016,"cheap material, but is cute",52016,3
52017,Definitely could tell someone hand made it and didn't do it right.,52017,3
52017,Fits supper awkward.. one Sleeve is longer than the other.,52017,3
52018,"Very cute bag...love the color, texture and very roomy inside.",52018,3
52018,But I don't like the zipper...it doesn't extend the length of the bag; it is a couple inches from the end of the bag (on both sides).,52018,3
52018,"Also, the original strap on the bag only has a 6 - 6 1/2 strap drop...I can't put it on my shoulder...although it does come with the other strap that has a much longer adjustable length strap drop; I didn't want to use it...I wanted to use to original one.",52018,3
52019,The bottoms are perfect for me but I can't breathe in the top,52019,3
52020,More of a tunic style fit,52020,3
52022,I love it because it's Star Wars but it's very thin.,52022,3
52022,It's not really much of a bit because of how thin the material is.,52022,3
52022,"And it's definitely not worth over the $14 I paid for it plus the shipping, but then again, because we are Star Wars nerds, we love it.",52022,3
52023,It's nice but tight fitting.,52023,3
52024,A little big but intended to order it a little bit big just in case it came smaller.,52024,3
52024,But do recommend for the price it's definitely right!,52024,3
52025,I would give this product 5 stars except the belt buckle paint comes off way too easily.,52025,3
52026,I guess for the price it's alright but the opal fell out as I was adjusting it to fit.,52026,3
52026,It needed adjustment because it was a bit too big and kepy falling off.,52026,3
52026,"That makes sense because no one's nose is going to be the same size, but the opal falling out during the adjustment kind of sucks.",52026,3
52027,Shorts were a good fit.,52027,3
52027,They were really cute.,52027,3
52027,One problem with them.,52027,3
52027,I could not button them since the hole for the button was sewn up!!,52027,3
52027,I had to cut a hole in between the slot where the button hole should of been.,52027,3
52027,Other than that they were fine.,52027,3
52028,I got the 2 pair deal.,52028,3
52028,"One bright green, one blue.",52028,3
52028,I took them with me on a 2 week trip to Tahiti where I would be snorkeling almost every day.,52028,3
52028,They are slightly thinner than I expected.,52028,3
52028,They worked great with my fins (added no extra size to my feet like my booties do) and when walking on the beach or smooth rocks.,52028,3
52028,"They are slightly better than bare feet for more jagged rocks but not nearly the protection that booties, Chacos, or cheap flip-flops would be on such surfaces.",52028,3
52028,I started with the blue pair and they lasted a couple days before the seam at the top of the foot/ankle just started disintegrating or shreading or something.,52028,3
52028,"I was kind of disappointed in how fast that happened, but I was happy I had gotten the 2 pairs, so just switched over to the green ones and they held strong through the rest of the 2 weeks and are still in good shape (I snorkeled and swam in them A LOT!).",52028,3
52028,"I never went into chlorinated water which, from what I read in the reviews, seemed to be the cause of a lot of problems with them, so I can't add anything on that.",52028,3
52029,It is a very cute raincoat and kept my daughter dry but the buttons all came off within a week of wearing it.,52029,3
52029,It is fixable but I shouldn't have to sew buttons onto a week-old coat.,52029,3
52030,It's cute but it's tiny,52030,3
52031,"nice and warm, but runs way big.",52031,3
52031,I needed it now so I kept it.,52031,3
52031,I may try washing it in HOT water and drying in a HOT dryer to see if I can shrink it enough to be off the ground..,52031,3
52031,The bottom snap on the front pulled out right away-not happy about that either.,52031,3
52032,These are actually very cute.,52032,3
52032,I don't know about the metal actually being stainless steel though.,52032,3
52032,I've had mixed results with these made-in-China products and these particular ones make my piercing itch.,52032,3
52032,"I never wear them in the shower or to bed, only for events or a day out.",52032,3
52032,I have other jewelry that claims to also be 316L Stainless and it doesn't make my nose itch so it's seems unique to these.,52032,3
52032,I would also say these are a little larger than other 16ga jewelry I have.,52032,3
52032,"If your septum is kind of narrow, be aware that the rings might get off-centered and/or tilt, making them look kind of silly/crooked.",52032,3
52032,Mine is narrow and I noticed this a lot which meant I was fidgeting with them more than I would have liked.,52032,3
52032,Easy to take in and out.,52032,3
52033,Threads are unwinding as I write this review.,52033,3
52034,I ordered a 4.5 and it was still too large.,52034,3
52034,Very comfortable but gets dirty quickly.,52034,3
52035,Look nice but a bit small.,52035,3
52036,Just a little too small,52036,3
52037,It fits weird around the armpits but other than that it's good.,52037,3
52038,Very beautiful flower headpiece.,52038,3
52038,It was a little bit big for my daughters head.,52038,3
52038,She is 10 in 4th grade but we still made it work and look nicely on her hair...,52038,3
52040,"Too wide for my narrow shoulders, gave it to my twin",52040,3
52041,A lot smaller than expected.,52041,3
52041,They are not that pretty or shiny but you get what you pay for.,52041,3
52041,I've been wearing them for several weeks now the balls have not fallen off easily.,52041,3
52042,"I love the top, it was just a bigger fit in the breast area",52042,3
52044,They look nice but got a run in the backside after the first wear.,52044,3
52044,I wanted to use them for yoga but they don't seem like they'd hold up.,52044,3
52044,Fine for lounging or wearing under a skirt.,52044,3
52045,I love the tank top the material is soft and beautiful.,52045,3
52045,My only problem is that I should have gotten a bigger size other wise it's lovely,52045,3
52046,The hood doesn't stay on very well so I decided to wear it without the hood.,52046,3
52046,My hair gets caught where the hood is supposed to secure onto the jacket.,52046,3
52046,Just be cautious if you have longer hair,52046,3
52047,I so wanted to love this dress!!,52047,3
52047,If I'm standing perfectly still with my arms at my sides it looks fairly cute but if I raise my arms the tiniest bit the neck line crinkles or falls off my shoulder.,52047,3
52047,I'm going to try and mess with it to see if I can get it to fit better.,52047,3
52047,Maybe even a little too thick.,52047,3
52048,"As earlier reviews have stated, the material is very thin.",52048,3
52048,"I didn't mind the cut and, even though they were a bit long, they are very wearable in a casual or office context and comfortable.",52048,3
52048,The fit is a bit specific.,52048,3
52048,Odd for a pull-on pant to be low-rise.,52048,3
52048,I had a gap in the back.,52048,3
52048,I am normally a 0-2 and ordered the 2P.,52048,3
52048,It's nice to see  a pull on pant in a small size.,52048,3
52048,Ultimately I returned these due to material quality and the fact that they are not appropriate for winter wear (I would need to size up and put tights underneath for them to be warm enough to wear December to March).,52048,3
52048,If these pants were $20 I might reconsider.,52048,3
52049,I wasn't a fan.,52049,3
52049,The quality wasn't quite as good as I was looking for.,52049,3
52049,"I believe it would do the job, but is more worried about looks than quality.",52049,3
52050,It does look a little cheaply made but for the price this is amazing.,52050,3
52050,The design is nothing as pictures though.,52050,3
52050,The appliques are applied underside which fades the lace appliques details a bit.,52050,3
52050,The comb is plastic but a nice decent size.,52050,3
52051,"I like the tweed and the gold touches that are disperse within the weave, but the size, for being XL, ( I
usually where a medium...) was much too small.",52051,3
52051,"I had read the review that it ran small; so hence, my ordering
an XL and that was still too small!",52051,3
52051,I will give it away to one of my very skinny friends rather than return it.,52051,3
52052,I bought them to combat thigh rub when wearing dresses and they work for that.,52052,3
52052,"For me they were very small in the thigh area and too big in the belly, even in my last trimester.",52052,3
52052,"There is a seam up both sides of the belly that shows under your dress, even if it isn't tight.",52052,3
52052,The material is a thick nylon so can be hot if you are wearing in hot weather.,52052,3
52052,The material of mine got runs and holes after wearing several times.,52052,3
52053,Ordered this for a gift.,52053,3
52053,"It's a nice sweater, but I need to return it and order a size up as the small is a bit too small.",52053,3
52054,But for jogging and working out oiss okayish.,52054,3
52054,You buy cheap you get cheap!,52054,3
52055,Product came from China.,52055,3
52055,It looks tattier than displayed.,52055,3
52055,"It's okay - but for the price, I expected better.",52055,3
52056,Would have been better with front pockets.,52056,3
52057,Now I love these earrings.,52057,3
52057,I really truly do.,52057,3
52057,That being said I was so disappointed when 3 weeks after purchasing one of the posts on my earrings broke off.,52057,3
52057,Now I have one hoop that I wear.,52057,3
52057,These hoops are amazing for those adults looking for something small enough to fit in the second or third piercing on their ear.,52057,3
52057,Each of my ears has three piercings.,52057,3
52057,I love to wear the one hoop that I now wear in my 2nd hole.,52057,3
52057,It hugs perfectly so I don't worry about it ripping off.,52057,3
52057,I have very sensitive skin and these yellow gold hoops are perfect.,52057,3
52057,No breakouts from these earrings.,52057,3
52057,I would LOVE to give these earrings a higher review.,52057,3
52057,I do wear my one remaining earring everyday.,52057,3
52057,I was so disappointed that they broke so fast after purchase.,52057,3
52057,I would suggest the jeweler of these wonderful earrings reinforce the posts a little better.,52057,3
52057,"Oh, and they click in nice and tight and I don't worry about them being pulled out easily.",52057,3
52058,"I really loved how this product looked on the model but when I got it, it was wayy too long (5'1).",52058,3
52058,It also looked a bit cheap and the under skirt was too short.,52058,3
52059,Kinds chunky...don't stay up.,52059,3
52060,I bought it as a gift.,52060,3
52060,It's nice and soft.,52060,3
52060,"I ordered size 5,  I received 5T.",52060,3
52060,I just hope it will fit my nephew that  just turned 5 years old.,52060,3
52061,"Strange bow on the back that did not match, but I was able to use a seam ripper and remove it.",52061,3
52061,Cute gathers under the bow.,52061,3
52062,I was surprised that there was no sparkle at all.,52062,3
52062,Probably didn't read the description well enough.,52062,3
52062,An artistic friend add sparkles for me and now I have a unique top.,52062,3
52063,I was very pleased with this dress at first.,52063,3
52063,It's a little tight at the bottom but manageable.,52063,3
52063,However I wore it for graduation last night and when I sat down it ripped up the side.,52063,3
52063,My upper thigh and part of my butt was exposed.,52063,3
52064,Nice hat but I wish it was a little more poofy.,52064,3
52065,a little small around the waist.,52065,3
52065,"However, I like the quality.",52065,3
52066,"Good support up front, but overall the ""large"" size tends to be a little small.",52066,3
52067,"Overall, I really like this sweater.",52067,3
52067,"The description says ""One szie (they can't spell size) loose fit for Small- Medium.."" but it will only fit women size 0, 2 and 4 (maybe a 6 if you have thin arms).",52067,3
52067,The sleeves are 3/4 in length.,52067,3
52067,The neckline it really high and it's not your standard scoop neck sweater.,52067,3
52067,"I am 5'3"" and I'm around 120lbs and I it's comfortable on me.",52067,3
52067,I am only giving it 3 stars because it's missing the care tag.,52067,3
52067,Where was this made?,52067,3
52067,How do I wash it?,52067,3
52067,"I thought the FTC requires manufacturers and importers to attach care instructions to garments so...

Also, I searched the pictured tag ""Purfeel your fashion choice deserve to have"" and nothing came up but clearly, English is not their first language!",52067,3
52068,When received product the pants were too small.,52068,3
52068,I don't think there made for people who have wider hips.,52068,3
52068,The other items fit and were okay.,52068,3
52069,"I was not able to carry it on,I have to check it in,it didn't fit the carry on .",52069,3
52070,"Cute, but a little snug.",52070,3
52070,I am busty and average sized and it was a little tight in the front.,52070,3
52070,"The neckline was also smaller then most shirts like this, smaller then the picture shows.",52070,3
52073,"very thin, but okay in the house.",52073,3
52074,Love the colour but was expecting it to be a little more leg hugging at the end.,52074,3
52074,Was a bit disappointed with that.,52074,3
52074,"But overall, nice dress.",52074,3
52075,"In search of thigh highs, I purchased these based on reviews.",52075,3
52075,I am a 5'5 female that weighs roughly 175.,52075,3
52075,I have somewhat bigger thighs due to lifting heavy weights.,52075,3
52075,Based on reviews I read I thought these would be a great fit and would stay up past my knee.,52075,3
52075,They went probably three inches over my knee but immediately rolled down making it uncomfortable and tight.,52075,3
52075,They're alright for keeping some length below the knee but be aware they do roll down easily.,52075,3
52076,"Very pretty, however they slip easily off my ears unless I squeeze them tightly to my ears which causes me discomfort.",52076,3
52076,so needless to say I don't wear them very much  I Also think they could have been a little bit larger.,52076,3
52077,"had to send it back, didn't like the quality",52077,3
52078,Fabric is beautiful and the pattern and colors are as they appear on the photo.,52078,3
52078,The sizing is off.,52078,3
52078,bust and arm fitting is too tight and restrictive.,52078,3
52078,Looking at the photo you totally do not get that it should feel snug or tight.,52078,3
52079,This bracelet is cute and comes in a little gift box.,52079,3
52079,I think it's probably better suited to a young girl than a woman.,52079,3
52079,I do like the handmade look.,52079,3
52079,"The materials are inexpensive, which is why I say it's a good gift for a young girl.",52079,3
52080,Had trouble finding the right size to fit my daughter.,52080,3
52080,Beautiful dress just sizing smaller than expected,52080,3
52081,I guess I need plus size,52081,3
52082,It broke really easily.,52082,3
52082,It only last a few monthes,52082,3
52083,Beautiful blouse but wayyyyyy too small good for a child size,52083,3
52084,It is good for one night.,52084,3
52084,I don't like the colored stiching.,52084,3
52084,"It almost looks like a child's ""play dress up"" purse.",52084,3
52084,Not very spacious despite the size due.,52084,3
52084,If you put too much in it it will bulge on the outside due to the thin material.,52084,3
52085,"This jacket is called a ""Convert"".",52085,3
52085,"It does not ""convert"" into anything.",52085,3
52085,"No removable liner, for example.",52085,3
52085,"Not sure what is meant by the use of the word ""convert"".",52085,3
52086,Kind of thin fabric.,52086,3
52088,Bottom are not boys hors as they appear..,52088,3
52089,"The socks had no stretch to them at all , they were not able to go around men's feet or calf with out some struggle, most of them could not get the lettering up to the calf which made them look like ankle socks .",52089,3
52089,"Not made for adults , just teenagers",52089,3
52090,order a size up,52090,3
52091,Nice thin t-shirt material but designed for people about 5 feet tall.,52091,3
52092,This product was incredibly disappointing.,52092,3
52092,The fabric wasn't soft at all and felt very itchy.,52092,3
52092,The actual shirt is very cropped and I would consider it a crop top and not a shirt.,52092,3
52092,"Overall, this shirt is very cheap and would not recommend buying it.",52092,3
52093,These are defiantly not meant to be worn on a sunny day in public.,52093,3
52093,"If you're bold enough on a hot summer night, maybe.",52093,3
52093,However it looks like they just took shorts and cut them shorter and up the sides.,52093,3
52093,"They could have edged the shorts so they don't fray, I give them one maybe two washes before they are ruined.",52093,3
52093,"What my reviews mean:
5 Stars: EXCELLENT!!!",52093,3
52093,The product met and exceeded all of my expectations.,52093,3
52093,"4 Stars: Met most, but not all of my expectations.",52093,3
52093,There is at least one little thing I do not like or needs improvement.,52093,3
52093,"The product gets the job done, but barely meets my expectations.",52093,3
52093,Something or a few things need improvement.,52093,3
52093,2 Stars: Don't bother wasting your time or money.,52093,3
52093,The product does not meet the designed purpose.,52093,3
52093,1 Star: Forget it!,52093,3
52093,It is a complete failure and was a complete waste of money!,52093,3
52093,Go find another product.,52093,3
52093,This one is Garbage!,52093,3
52093,Thank you for taking the time to read my review.,52093,3
52094,I loved the shirt but the skirt was a little small.,52094,3
52094,I have really big hips and it barely fit around my stomach.,52094,3
52094,At least the shirt fits.,52094,3
52095,These are very cute.,52095,3
52095,They fit my one year-old and stretched enough for my three-year-old.,52095,3
52095,"And while there are grips on the bottom, they are on the flat part of the foot.",52095,3
52095,"Not on the heel or toes, where they would do the most good.",52095,3
52095,If your child has high arches they won't touch the sticky part to the floor at all.,52095,3
52095,They seem to do a good enough job for my one year old anyway.,52095,3
52096,"Gloves shipped from China and yes, they did stink.",52096,3
52096,"Three washings later, they still smell but not as bad.",52096,3
52096,"However, they are cute and warm enough for temps in the high 30s.",52096,3
52097,"A Little small, but not bad.",52097,3
52098,"Very petite fitting - arms and legs are very short - size small ordered for a petite elderly person who is about 4'11""",52098,3
52099,"Only for tall girls, I'm 5'2 and i have to alter it to fit my body .",52099,3
52099,"It's too long and hips not in a right place for me, but I still will keep it, because I know how to saw and it's pretty easy to fix it.",52099,3
52099,"Otherwise I like it, but you have to be at least 5'6 for this dress.",52099,3
52100,"Very small, doesn't cover my boobs at all, should have ordered a larger size but for the price I'm not really upset.",52100,3
52100,Might order a bigger one and give this one to a friend,52100,3
52101,A little narrow but cute,52101,3
52102,"This scarf is huge, and as such is quite intimidating.",52102,3
52102,It is soft and the colors are lovely though so I do like it.,52102,3
52102,I just have no idea how to wear it since it it so large.,52102,3
52102,Think more of a small picnic blanket than a scarf.,52102,3
52102,"Probably operator error...yes, most likely",52102,3
52103,"Am only disappointed for the fact that it was sewed like crap, saw all the thread from the material an had to be a seamstress for the day.",52103,3
52104,I bought these with high hopes.,52104,3
52104,"After a few weeks of ownership and gentle care, one of the sides have completely fallen off already.",52104,3
52104,They are nice sunglasses but i wish it would've stayed together.,52104,3
52105,It was just what I needed.,52105,3
52105,But when I put them on.,52105,3
52105,There was a hole already in the seam.,52105,3
52105,As I needed them for that day only I just used them.,52105,3
52106,Product is too small and the straps across the chest are too high up.,52106,3
52107,"I am 5""0', 120 lbs.",52107,3
52107,It's a bit wide for the fit.,52107,3
52107,It was too late for return so I am stuck with the jacket.,52107,3
52108,Didn't hold up well.,52108,3
52109,The strangest inside pocket!,52109,3
52109,It's like its been put in upside down!,52109,3
52110,I like it I just put it on as a dress and it work out but the over all its cute..,52110,3
52111,I like this sweater.,52111,3
52111,"However, I ordered an XL because I like when my sleeves are really long and I was very disappointed when the sleeves were too short.",52111,3
52111,It was more like a 3 quarter length sweater rather than a long sleeve one.,52111,3
52112,a bit bigger and gaudier than I thought.,52112,3
52113,Nice hat but the sizing listed in the description is inaccurate.,52113,3
52113,The XL should be 23.5 to 24 inches yet I measured  22.5 inches.,52113,3
52113,The 1 to 1.5 inches smaller makes it M not an XL.,52113,3
52113,Wish it would fit.,52113,3
52114,I usually love zmart and have a lot of therir socks.,52114,3
52114,They fit great and are fairly well made socks.,52114,3
52114,They hold their color well too.,52114,3
52114,"However, I am only giving three stars because when my socks arrived two pair were clearly used socks.",52114,3
52114,They had hair stuck to the bottom and were filthy and gross..,52114,3
52114,I do not understand how this mistake is made by zmart.,52114,3
52114,I understand they can be washed and worn.,52114,3
52114,But it's the principle that I paid for new socks.,52114,3
52114,Not nasty used socks.,52114,3
52115,"The straps are cute on the back but the front fabric is minimal so side boob is a problem and when you are already wearing something flimsy, that is not what I want.",52115,3
52116,I love my other 90 Degree pants (the solid colors).,52116,3
52116,"However, these heather ones are a different material and a different fit.",52116,3
52116,I ordered the same size as my others but these have absolutely no give in them.,52116,3
52116,They were skin tight.,52116,3
52116,"You could even see the lines in my ""no show"" underwear!",52116,3
52116,The material is also not the same as the solid color leggings.,52116,3
52116,"This material is not soft, but more stiff almost.",52116,3
52116,I will be returning this pair and ordering another solid color.,52116,3
52117,The stays are ok.,52117,3
52117,"I guess you get what you pay for, they are not a very nice finish and look to be just punched out of a sheet of metal.",52117,3
52117,I have a set of workin stiffs which I really like and are very nice.,52117,3
52117,But they are expensive and I don't use the magnets so thought I'd try these.,52117,3
52117,The variety of size stays seemed like a good idea but in reality 90% of my shirts require the standard length.,52117,3
52117,The rest take unique shape stays and I'm better off with the plastic ones that come with the shirts.,52117,3
52117,In the end I'm using my working stiffs and plastics.,52117,3
52118,"The material is a little loser than other head wraps I have gotten, not as snug to the head.",52118,3
52119,Nice and cheeky but the front is incredibly small.,52119,3
52119,Highwasted is not the best description for this product but not bad.,52119,3
52119,Best to go up a size.,52119,3
52121,"Nice design bag, but smaller than I expected....Also the interior lining is a very noisy, plastic-like material..",52121,3
52123,It doesn't look very much like the picture but it's still really cute and comfy.,52123,3
52123,Very thick sweater material so it's good for winter.,52123,3
52123,I just expected what I paid for.,52123,3
52124,I have a 32C cup and am petite.,52124,3
52124,this was super tight and I order a medium.,52124,3
52124,Can't really wear a bra.,52124,3
52125,"They were not as long as I thought, barely came up to the knee and wouldn't stay up.",52125,3
52125,Couple rhinestones also fell off upon removing it from the package.,52125,3
52125,Otherwise they are still cute.,52125,3
52126,"Nice belt, but doesn't stretch very much at all.",52126,3
52126,Still waiting to find a true leather stretch belt to replace one I bought years ago.,52126,3
52127,"It's super cute, vibrant colours, but it's rather wide and short,",52127,3
52128,Ring ok looks good not sure about the coating.,52128,3
52129,It isn't very pink at all.,52129,3
52129,"However, it is still a beautiful rosary.",52129,3
52130,not a great material.,52130,3
52130,none of the sizes fits my husband's shirts.,52130,3
52130,but you might be lucky to make a better use of this set.,52130,3
52130,Not a bad deal for the price,52130,3
52131,the top was too tight and the skirt was too big..it was weird.,52131,3
52131,for one night i made it work.,52131,3
52131,get at least one size larger if you are top heavy or it will not work,52131,3
52133,Does not fit as photographed.,52133,3
52133,Very clingy in the lower mid section.,52133,3
52134,"I usually wear a size small in tee shirts, went by the chart and ordered a medium, I can wear it but its  still a bit tight.",52134,3
52135,The material is a little flimsy and thin not as long as I expected,52135,3
52136,Straps are really long so you'll want to wear an undershirt.,52136,3
52136,It ships from China so takes awhile to get here.,52136,3
52136,I wore this for a dance performance so it did the trick but it could be better.,52136,3
52137,"They look good, but I received 2 pair of the same partnered sock.",52137,3
52137,Can't write an entire review just because he hasn't worn them.,52137,3
52138,"I have a pretty small nose and my piercing is a bit crooked, so this didn't work out very well for me.",52138,3
52138,"I could feel the edges, and I didn't like it.",52138,3
52138,But it is beautiful and stays in!,52138,3
52138,It was hard to take off with my small nose.,52138,3
52139,I really like it.,52139,3
52139,It just didn't fit.,52139,3
52140,"Pretty dress, but certainly not for a curvy hourglass figure.",52140,3
52140,"There is absolutely no give or stretch in the material whatsoever, so if you have some hips and a booty I would avoid this dress altogether!",52140,3
52141,"size unclear descriptions, I end up return it.",52141,3
52141,Good quality boots if you know your kids size.,52141,3
52142,"Very pretty, I placed it on my dinning table.",52142,3
52142,As for the scent you have to stand over it to smell it.,52142,3
52142,I feel it would work better in a enclose small area.,52142,3
52143,My granddaughter is 7 and the tail fit iher well.,52143,3
52143,The top was too large.,52143,3
52143,It ripped on the seam the first day.,52143,3
52143,I easily sewed it up.,52143,3
52143,"For the price, it's a good toy.",52143,3
52143,I don't think it will last more than the summer which is fine at her age.,52143,3
52145,"I loved look of it, but it's kind of small.",52145,3
52146,The material is nice as well as the color.,52146,3
52146,The dots were larger than expected.,52146,3
52146,"They fit well, but there are two things I don't care for, but which I will remedy.",52146,3
52146,"They are high-waisted with elastic around the entire waist, which I find uncomfortable.",52146,3
52146,I will remove the elastic and make them into lower-waisted scrub-like bottoms.,52146,3
52146,The legs are way too wide.,52146,3
52146,Picture a shorter version of elephant pants.,52146,3
52146,I will take in the seams to make a more tailored fit.,52146,3
52146,"When I'm done, they should be very comfortable and more stylish.",52146,3
52146,"I would consider buying another pair, but not until I have the time to make the adjustments.",52146,3
52146,"Oh, they wash and dry really well.",52146,3
52146,They came out wrinkle free.,52146,3
52147,Comfy material but a little snug,52147,3
52148,Cute glasses bought them in Aug and nose piece broke off in Dec.,52148,3
52149,"Have a flexible clear case,the hard one scares me",52149,3
52150,"This hat is nice, but in the picture it looks like a military style hat.",52150,3
52150,The hat came as a baseball style hat.,52150,3
52150,I wish that had been more obvious in the picture.,52150,3
52151,My boobs needed to be pulled up a lot.,52151,3
52151,"I ended up sewing the back, which helped.",52151,3
52151,I like the pattern and it covered what needed to be covered.,52151,3
52152,I ordered an extra large and it's slightly snug all my other shirt are loose,52152,3
52153,Purchased this outfit for my son to wear to a wedding.,52153,3
52153,The outfit fit okay.,52153,3
52153,It was a little snug in the crotch area.,52153,3
52153,It looked like he had a full diaper on in pictures.,52153,3
52153,Be careful when washing the outfit.,52153,3
52153,I read on one of the reviews that the red tie stains/bleeds.,52153,3
52153,I decided to wet the tie first (the tie is removable) and let it dry and it did bleed.,52153,3
52153,So I ended up handwashing the outfit to avoid damaging his other clothes..,52153,3
52153,The tie still bled onto the shirt a little bit when he wore it since he was drooling/chewing on it.,52153,3
52153,"Other than that, the outfit did it's job.",52153,3
52153,"It was a little hard to put on since it doesn't have buttons all the way down,  but luckily the pants part were buttons and made it easy for diaper changes.",52153,3
52153,And the outfit wasn't too thick even though it was long sleeves so it was perfect for the summer wedding,52153,3
52154,My son has a relative small head and this fit tight around his head.,52154,3
52154,"Not too tight though and I like that it won't fall off that easily, but I was hoping he would have some room to grow with it.",52154,3
52154,"Other than that, the material is a good quality and it looks super cute",52154,3
52155,"The product is advertised as 100% cotton but after receiving the shirt, the shirt is actually 90% cotton and 10% polyester.",52155,3
52155,You can definitely tit is not 100% cotton.,52155,3
52155,The material is a lot rougher to touch and has a crunchy feeling when i tried it on.,52155,3
52155,It also has a chemical smell.,52155,3
52155,I'm going to wash it before i officially wear it.,52155,3
52155,It didn't really fulfill my expectations but time will tell if i come to love it or not.,52155,3
52155,I like it but i just wish the material was what they advertised it as.,52155,3
52156,Good price cute dress,52156,3
52157,"Not sure about these,  they definitely are not of the qualitie I am used to by this brand, and they are thinner also, I bought the black ones so I don't have any issue with them being see thru but I can definitely imagine some of the other colors having that problem.",52157,3
52157,With hat said they are still comfortable and I do wear them quite a bit.,52157,3
52157,"Not sure if I would buy them again, I probably would because there fit is perfect but I would stick with the darker colors to avoid any issues with transparency",52157,3
52158,It's ok.  Not the greatest quality but ok for the price.,52158,3
52159,But 5'10 and 160 pounds Large is too small.,52159,3
52160,A little big for a 7 year old,52160,3
52161,Too long and somewhat small,52161,3
52162,Quite OK but it's made mostly for tall guys..will fit u perfectly if u tall and u purchase your usual size.....,52162,3
52163,Not too bad for the price.,52163,3
52164,"Bummed because it is very cute but way smaller in person, almost child like in size",52164,3
52165,"Purse is ok, but not big enough and there needs a little larger handles.",52165,3
52166,It's ok it could be better,52166,3
52167,I like the dress a lot but still have not been able to wear it.,52167,3
52167,"Arms are way too tight, but the rest of the dress fits.",52167,3
52168,I am a full figured queen.,52168,3
52168,The material s too thin and too revealing.,52168,3
52169,Really cute shirt but runs wayyy small...I ordered an XL and ended up giving it a friend who wears a small!,52169,3
52170,I do not like how this swimming suit fits.,52170,3
52170,It would've been perfect if the cups were made bigger and the straps weren't removable.,52170,3
52170,This was definitely not made for ladies with large breasts.,52170,3
52171,Cute necklace but it's looks NOTHING like what's pictured.,52171,3
52172,"Ordered based on their size guide, and my 8 (29inches, 22lbs.)",52172,3
52172,month old will fit these in maybe (maybe!),52172,3
52172,"Great about returns, though.",52172,3
52174,"After wearing it, I find the stitching coming apart.",52174,3
52175,Ordered from readying review and ordered up.,52175,3
52175,The only part I had issue with is the elastic waist was way too tight.,52175,3
52175,I remove it and it fit a lot better and more comfortable.,52175,3
52175,If you like the loose relax fit.,52175,3
52177,Not bad looking in person.,52177,3
52177,But you can definitely tell these are cheap bags by the hardware and zippers.,52177,3
52177,Very cheap feeling and I'm hopeing the hardware doesn't b reak off.,52177,3
52178,Very wide in the hip area but made for a very small busted to no bust person.,52178,3
52178,Especially for something so inexpensive.,52178,3
52178,Had difficulty with the delivery They don't tell you that you must be home to get the delivery because it's coming form India.,52178,3
52178,I finally got them to redeliver and left it at the door as needed but it took quite some time.,52178,3
52179,"Super cute , nice fabric.",52179,3
52179,Not even cute long could have been a dress but not really a cute dress.,52179,3
52179,Sending it back so wish it would have worked,52179,3
52180,Nice but i need a shaper.. it shows every satellite on my body lol,52180,3
52182,"Bigger than normal nose ring size, and the color chips easy.",52182,3
52182,"I've been wearing the black ones for like a week now, and on one, the color is chipping off.",52182,3
52182,I like the colors though.,52182,3
52182,And that it comes in doubles so I can have matching rings for my nose piercings.,52182,3
52183,My daughter likes the mermaid tail.,52183,3
52184,Had bag less than 3 months and zipper already ripped from bag.,52184,3
52184,Should not happen to a quality bag in this amount of time.,52184,3
52185,Fits well and is comfy never mind the price,52185,3
52186,This skirt is made from a lightweight spandex material.,52186,3
52186,It has a waistband with elastic in the back and relies on the stretch of the fabric for fronts and sides.,52186,3
52186,My daughter is a US teen medium/large and this just barely fits.,52186,3
52186,For the price (less than $10) it was great for her Halloween costume.,52186,3
52186,She'll be able to wear it as regular part of her wardrobe too.,52186,3
52186,It could use some kind of reinforcement/lining in the waistband and the bottom edge is a raw cut.,52186,3
52186,I would even consider buying again depending on how it does in a few washes.,52186,3
52187,I imagine it would have been very cool... if it actually fit as described.,52187,3
52190,"Very disappointed with the sizing, we tried three times before giving up",52190,3
52191,I love the shirt design.,52191,3
52191,"However, the material is tissue paper thin and the bottom part of the shirt fits like a bathing suit.",52191,3
52192,The hat is not very deep so it doesn't come down very far on the head.,52192,3
52193,"Its OK,a little big though.",52193,3
52195,A cheaper quality version of the Torrid swimsuit.,52195,3
52196,Wanted to love it but the sleeves were too long and the fit was boxier than expected.,52196,3
52196,Sadly it was returned,52196,3
52197,Cute and worth the price BUT don't throw it in the washer and dryer!,52197,3
52197,It shrunk to about half of it's normal size.,52197,3
52197,"It is still a cute, beachy top...",52197,3
52197,But now I just have to wear pants or shorts with it.,52197,3
52198,It is what I was looking for and will work.,52198,3
52199,Looks like the picture.,52199,3
52199,But the material is very cheaply made.,52199,3
52199,But you get what you pay for.,52199,3
52199,"So,it is worth the price.",52199,3
52200,The latch broke as I was trying it on.,52200,3
52202,Started fraying the first week.,52202,3
52203,"You're not getting Nike quality here, but that's why you're paying less than half the price.",52203,3
52203,"So don't expect any moisture wicking or anything like that, but it has a nice feel to it and is comfy...until you sweat up a storm and it's sopping wet.",52203,3
52203,"Then it hangs a bit heavy on you, and you're not comfortable anymore.",52203,3
52203,The size is a little in the big side (I'm comparing it to Nike sizes).,52203,3
52203,"I ordered a S, and it fits almost the same as my M Nike shirt.",52203,3
52203,"So if you're wondering what size to get, take that into consideration.",52203,3
52203,"Overall, not a bad buy for the price, just don't expect Nike performance from it.",52203,3
52204,"Dress is beautiful, came on time as promised.",52204,3
52205,The shirt/quality is nice.,52205,3
52205,It is really long though.,52205,3
52205,"Luckily,  my daughter likes to tie her shirts on one side at the bottom anyway.",52205,3
52207,Very small fit for a large,52207,3
52208,I use this at work when I don't wear my cargo pants in place of the many pockets.,52208,3
52208,It fits small items that aren't bulky i.e.,52208,3
52208,"pens, notepad, small snacks.",52208,3
52208,Works well for me.,52208,3
52208,"It looks like the picture, very small and has only two compartments: the front and one closest to the body.",52208,3
52209,Very cute outfit but shorts ran big and normally I have to worry about things being to small on my daughter I gotta five but could have gotten a four possibly even a three the shorts were so big the shirt fit as expected though,52209,3
52210,Ehh this was an okay vest !,52210,3
52210,"I think its a bit too long for me especially because I am petite 5""1.",52210,3
52210,The fur and color was nice but I just think it would look nicer if you were taller.,52210,3
52210,Also it fits a little too big .,52210,3
52211,Ordered a size up and it fit EXACTLY the same as the smaller size...,52211,3
52211,BUT customer service was super nice and helpful!,52211,3
52212,"The price was good, the packaging was good.",52212,3
52212,It fit nicely and was really cute.,52212,3
52212,"THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS VEST
I wore a white tank top underneath it, and it turned quite a bit of my tank pink (I bought the wine red color).",52212,3
52212,I also got my nails done wine red with one white nail; which turned pink also from rubbing against the vest.,52212,3
52212,So my fix is just not to wear this vest with white or really light colors.,52212,3
52213,Not as big as I thought according to the size listed.,52213,3
52214,I loved the quality but the small was too large for me in the bust and waist area.,52214,3
52214,"I'm 5'2"" and 105lbs and usually wear a size 0.",52214,3
52214,Passed it on to someone else who it fit perfectly.,52214,3
52214,"Be mindful that the material, especially in the skirt area runs a little bit thin and might cause your underwear to print through.",52214,3
52214,Stick with black undies/spanx when wearing.,52214,3
52215,"I hate to leave such a negative review, but the dress I received is so much different than the one pictured, I feel it important anyone interested be aware...",52215,3
52215,"The dress I received resembled it close enough to know I hadn't accidentally been given the wrong item- it was white, the texture of the fabric looked the same, it was white...",52215,3
52215,"But I had expected a flowy, relaxed construction, deep v, 3/4 sleeve skater mini dress...",52215,3
52215,"The dress I received was made of a very stiff fabric in top, then several layers of tulle underneath (think tutu or petticoat  material) which made the skirt very puffy and stay in place when moving around/feel very structured.",52215,3
52215,"The sleeves came just above my elbow, and the v was just mid- chest/a couple inches past the collarbone- nowhere near the picture where it extends passed the bra line, and came down to just above my knees (I'm 5'7"").",52215,3
52215,"To be clear, the dress wasn't ugly, but it wasn't what I wanted.",52215,3
52215,"I possibly could have made it work for what it was, but unfortunately the fabric was so stiff, it wasn't just uncomfortable, it was painful to have on while trying it on, there was no way I would have survived a day wearing it.",52215,3
52215,"Aside from the pain being the main reason I returned this, it also just wasn't flattering on me and made me feel like I was in a tutu when I hoped for a light, sleek dress for summer:(",52215,3
52216,"The colors were pretty, but I bought it for a friend that wears smalls and mediums, and it was way too tight on her.",52216,3
52217,"Cute shirt, but runs big for a 2T",52217,3
52218,"But fit extremely small , I ordered 2x up and they still fit me kinda tight .. so tight that if I sit for about 30 minutes or longer my stomach will hurt, but overall the jeans are as described and look cute.",52218,3
52218,Just wished they fit.,52218,3
52218,"I'm 155 lbs 28"" waist , 40"" hips and I ordered a 2XL and still fit tight, so ""thick"" ladies beware",52218,3
52219,It is nice just have to reinforce it to make it last,52219,3
52220,it is ok does not state what the braclets stand for another mistake,52220,3
52221,"I give it a 3 just because the sizes don't run true to size, you would have to get 2/3 sizes under yours.",52221,3
52221,"However, everyone loved the flashing lights and the music box it came with.",52221,3
52221,"It has Christmas jingles and Santa yelling ""ho ho ho"".",52221,3
52222,"Sizes are way off.. however, was good quality",52222,3
52223,The flower looks beautiful but the color of the chain is a bright gold.,52223,3
52223,And its a really large pendant.,52223,3
52223,Its a little weird to wear a necklace that big.,52223,3
52223,looks like a pocket watch,52223,3
52224,"Comfortable when I wore it new, but I don't think it will stand up over time even though I washed on cold, and skipped the drier.",52224,3
52225,A large is like 2X,52225,3
52226,"The material seems a little cheap on this, not sure how long it will last for....",52226,3
52227,Beautiful cover up however a bit large for my petite frame.,52227,3
52227,I'm keeping it anyways.,52227,3
52228,It is a nice gift but something you could use a one and off.,52228,3
52228,I feel it is not designed for long term use.,52228,3
52229,Awesome cleats size is not accurate they run small,52229,3
52231,The ring was too big and thick.,52231,3
52231,It was attractive though.,52231,3
52232,"Wish I liked this more, but it's too...phony-looking.",52232,3
52233,I ordered a size medium but received a large.,52233,3
52233,I am a 12/14 and the large is way too big.,52233,3
52233,I ordered the pink and I did like the color.,52233,3
52233,The fabric is nice quality and the price was great.,52233,3
52233,Would have given more stars if I had not receive the wrong size :-(,52233,3
52234,Rides down when under jeans or shorts.,52234,3
52236,Its so warm a cozy,52236,3
52237,It was cute but too short.. looks longer in the picture.,52237,3
52238,"It's kind of cute, kind of meh!",52238,3
52238,"But the fabric is like thin T-shirt material, fabric that is more suitable for a top rather than a dress.",52238,3
52238,"I am not a tiny person and have a couple extra pounds, which the clingy fabric accentuates everytime I move unless I pose in one position all day!",52238,3
52238,Might be okay as a night gown.,52238,3
52239,They are very light and look good!,52239,3
52239,"They do however, seem to slide down your nose a lot which gets annoying especially on hot days.",52239,3
52239,Build quality seems to be good too.,52239,3
52240,colors are brighter in person.,52240,3
52240,overall its just okay.,52240,3
52241,It looks like shiny metal.,52241,3
52242,It didn't flow well.,52242,3
52243,Need a bigger size,52243,3
52244,"Stones for candles too small, otherwise cute charm.",52244,3
52245,"Great suit, very flattering but definitely order 1 size up from what you would normally wear.",52245,3
52246,"Thin, but a fun variety of socks.",52246,3
52247,The sizing that's described in the information section says that I should be a size 1 (I wear an 8) so that's what I ordered.,52247,3
52247,"I barely have a belly at 15 weeks, but my jeans are getting a little uncomfortably tight where they button, so I wanted this to be able to unbutton my jeans.",52247,3
52247,It's too loose right now.,52247,3
52247,"That may change as my pregnancy progresses, and if it does, I'll update my review.",52247,3
52247,"I do like the non slip band around the top, but the band itself is just not right enough.",52247,3
52247,"Consider ordering down a size, if you're closer to the small end of the suggested size.",52247,3
52248,fits well but a little thin,52248,3
52249,I usually wear a small but ordered a medium and it was still a little tight through the hips.,52249,3
52250,Nice product but it should say fitted on discription.,52250,3
52251,"Regrettably, this was too tight.",52251,3
52251,"I love the look, but it is much too tight.",52251,3
52252,Fits a bit short-wasted and the neckline is not as deep as depicted in the pictures.,52252,3
52252,"I'm 5'8, 145 lbs, and usually wear a medium in my tops and 36B in bra size.",52252,3
52252,I ordered an XL per the size chart.,52252,3
52252,"I'll still wear it because it fits, just not quite what I was looking for.",52252,3
52253,would love to review how it fit but i couldn't even fit it on my head.,52253,3
52253,not much stretch at all and smaller than average.,52253,3
52253,I was going to send it back but gave it to my 8 year old niece to wear instead.,52253,3
52255,Cotton not so great.,52255,3
52256,Cute but doesn't fit like the picture.,52256,3
52257,Fits great I am truly a medium in clothing I ordered a small because didn't want it to be loose and it fits great.,52257,3
52257,One snap button was broken so I sent it back and should be receiving another shortly.,52257,3
52257,I am currently 5'5 140lbs.,52257,3
52257,I have gained about 10lbs and plan to loose the 10 I think the jumper will still fit well 10lbs lighter,52257,3
52258,"Not as slouchy as I wanted, I never wear it.",52258,3
52258,But it's a good quality hat.,52258,3
52259,The magnetic clip does not work well.,52259,3
52260,"I ordered wrong size, but it was ok.",52260,3
52260,It's a pretty dress ^^,52260,3
52261,Faded after 1st wash,52261,3
52262,"It was see-through and a little smaller than expected, although the pattern was lovely.",52262,3
52262,I wound up giving it to a friend who is a little lighter than me!,52262,3
52263,Typical Havianas nothing special about this - great for a gym shower sandal.,52263,3
52264,the shape was not very good-- the quality of the sewing was pretty low,52264,3
52265,"the stripes are a neon choral-ish color, not the softer pink in the picture.",52265,3
52265,also the picture made it seem like it would fit loose but in reality it it pretty form fitting.,52265,3
52265,so not what I expected/wanted but it is still cute so it gets 3 stars.,52265,3
52266,"Fine, just too orange to look like gold.",52266,3
52266,"Can be worn alone, but not beside real gold",52266,3
52268,i am tall and they always come just a little short.,52268,3
52268,the elastic on top is weak.,52268,3
52268,they slid a bit.,52268,3
52268,"lasted til 2 time wearing, what more do i need i guess.",52268,3
52269,"Cute, but doesn't seem very durable.",52269,3
52269,Strings coming out already.,52269,3
52270,The value of the lingerie was close to price.,52270,3
52270,You cannot see it in the photo but the halter piece that goes around the neck is not the same width.,52270,3
52270,On one side it has the thickness you see in the photo but once it reaches the back of the neck it thins to the thickness of a string.,52270,3
52270,He had no complaints but I felt it wasn't advertised correctly.,52270,3
52271,Nice hat but after wearing it just once the stitching started to unravel.,52271,3
52272,Cute but very cheap quality.,52272,3
52272,I cut the shorts tie off- not safe.,52272,3
52272,1 wash and black Minnie fading.,52272,3
52273,We got a lot of duplicates.,52273,3
52273,There were also a lot of damaged balls.,52273,3
52273,You can't expect too much for a large lot of body jewelry like this.,52273,3
52273,My daughter was disappointed that there weren't too many different styles and some of her favorites didn't have duplicates and were damaged.,52273,3
52273,She said it was an okay purchase for as many as she got but she doesn't think she will buy like this again.,52273,3
52274,Small fit but cute.,52274,3
52274,Waiting to lose weight lol,52274,3
52275,It was a bit larger than expected but still okay fit.,52275,3
52275,I will be returning unfortunately because the color is a tad off and not black its blue.,52275,3
52275,Just not what i expected.,52275,3
52275,And it arrived 1 day late...,52275,3
52276,"It came before the expected delivery date so I was pretty thrilled :) Fair warning, the skirt has no elastic and you've got to fight the zipper a little, even when you're not wearing the skirt.",52276,3
52276,"The material's good for the price, it is a bit see through but it's bearable.",52276,3
52276,"The reviews aren't kidding when they say go a size up, like seriously.",52276,3
52276,"If you think a size is perfect for you, just go one up just to be safe.",52276,3
52276,Also I also the XL.,52276,3
52276,"I'm 5'9"" and a little bottom heavy.",52276,3
52276,I like to crush it on leg day.,52276,3
52276,"That being said, with the length of the skirt being short as it is, combined with my height, and then with a bottom heavy musculature, the skirt is short.",52276,3
52276,I tried putting my compression shorts on underneath and the skirt just wasn't having it.,52276,3
52276,"But the shirt did fit, it's lightweight and a little stretchy, and it isn't that tacky, itchy material you've probably worn when dealing with other online costumes.",52276,3
52276,"Also for the price, you could always just get the set in black and white, and if the skirt doesn't fit, you could find a black pair that does.",52276,3
52276,Pleated skirts are in this year so I'm sure you'll find one that matches the shirt.,52276,3
52276,"Sucks that the skirt didn't fit, but I kind of already knew what I was getting myself into, so I'm not mad about it :)",52276,3
52277,Awesome set to use for stretching.,52277,3
52277,"When you're only staying at a size for a few weeks, there's no point in spending a lot of money on them.",52277,3
52277,They all come in individual zipper baggies with the sizes on them.,52277,3
52277,"The tapers have a nice long ""at-size"" section so you have some room to wiggle them around without pushing them all the way through.",52277,3
52277,The tunnels are just cheap looking plastic with kind of a shiny coating on them.,52277,3
52277,"They're much much more blue and ""plasticy"" than the picture shows and the ""colorful plating"" is barely noticeable and starts to wear off in a few days.",52277,3
52277,"Now, all that being said, they are still a great buy for sizing up as long as you're not expecting anything fancy and realize that you're totally getting what you pay for.",52277,3
52278,"Cute, but needs work.",52278,3
52279,Difficult to get on.,52279,3
52279,The edges are kind of rough when trying to put onto my wrist and I have very small wrists.,52279,3
52280,Kind of see-through but not a bad shirt for the price.,52280,3
52280,My boyfriend loved it,52280,3
52281,Fits ok but is suppose to be loose fitting shirt...,52281,3
52281,If you want it loose go up two sizes not just one!,52281,3
52281,Sequins are scratchy on arms but overall is cute!,52281,3
52281,Looks very close to the picture!,52281,3
52282,"32A, Fits, Cheaply made.",52282,3
52282,Will most likely only survive a washing or two.,52282,3
52282,Took Forever to get here.,52282,3
52283,"i like the colors and the look, but its too heavy and becomes annoying to wear after a few hours.",52283,3
52284,"Fit great, but very thin and see through.",52284,3
52284,Most definitely will wear another part under.,52284,3
52285,It's a gift I have no idea,52285,3
52286,"OK, took a long time to arrive, and they are very small.",52286,3
52286,You can only wear this with leggings...jeans is too bulky,52286,3
52287,"The dress is cute but I think these are actual American sizes, the 2x was just too big.",52287,3
52287,I wear a 16/18 in dresses and pants.,52287,3
52287,I have a big butt and wide hips but sm/med chest so it really depends on the cut.,52287,3
52287,I love maxi dresses and stay in them in the summer but the cut of this dress with the criss cross front just swallowed me.,52287,3
52287,"Normally with the dresses I've purchased from Amazon, they are Asian sizing and you have to size up but this one I think you can order your normal size.",52287,3
52288,Lovely but it broke!,52288,3
52288,I wore it often and sadly it wasn't very  sturdy,52288,3
52289,Way too short - otherwise okay.,52289,3
52290,It does not like picture as shown.,52290,3
52290,the growing ball is smaller than i expect and the growing color is green.,52290,3
52291,The color is not pretty in person.,52291,3
52292,I bought an EXTRA LARGE!,52292,3
52292,This shirt is the size of an XTRA XTRA SMALL!,52292,3
52292,It is a nice shirt!,52292,3
52292,It would have been perfect for a tiny tiny 6 year old!,52292,3
52293,"I like it, but it's a little small.",52293,3
52293,I also wish it came with better instructions the different way to wear it instead of just one the bag with pictures.,52293,3
52293,I'm not that creative.,52293,3
52296,Fit great and looks great but did not receive bag of extra jewels as stated with order and rebiews.,52296,3
52298,one of them wouldn't unscrew no matter what I did so I am only wearing one...,52298,3
52299,These jeans overall is good but the ankle is not as skinny how I wanted to be.,52299,3
52300,"Very very small, I'm xxs size, so I ordered size M, and it is very small, mainly in the bobs",52300,3
52301,"Very cute top but size is too small; order one or two sizes up fron what you normally wear, and depending on how loose you like your tops.",52301,3
52302,"There were no reviews on this, but I took a chance that a 2x would fit because the picture shows a plus size model!",52302,3
52302,"Nope, this is not a 2x, maybe a XL.",52302,3
52302,"There is no size inside, or a tag, just the bag it came in with 2x on the outside.",52302,3
52302,"The dress is cute, so I am so disappointed.",52302,3
52302,I don't know if I am going to try the 3x or not.,52302,3
52302,"Right now, I am somewhat mad at the deceptive picture!",52302,3
52303,did not like the way it looked,52303,3
52304,It's small.. *sigh* still nice though..,52304,3
52305,cute but makes me hurt cuz the bar is too thick,52305,3
52306,I bought this since I bought some from my foot doctor.,52306,3
52306,They help a lot with plantar fasciitis.,52306,3
52306,"However, although these are powerstep, the quality is really subpar compared to the powerstep protech l had before.",52306,3
52306,It's only been two months and the material on top of it is peeling.,52306,3
52307,Fit is very small but nice sweatshirt,52307,3
52308,"Clasp is weak, falls off a lot",52308,3
52309,"Love the shoe, only it started to get color spots on them, not sure if it was from water or what...",52309,3
52309,I got the black pair too and those still look great!,52309,3
52310,Great quality justs runs very smaller,52310,3
52311,Not the greatest quality.,52311,3
52311,They are cute and I've gotten a few wears out of them.,52311,3
52312,A little bit small,52312,3
52313,if you have a but it will be short .,52313,3
52314,Sizing runs on the very small side.,52314,3
52314,Garment was well constructed.,52314,3
52315,"Packed it with a laptop, socks, rolled t-shirt and hard-cover paper notebook for recent flights.",52315,3
52315,"Fit, barely, under seatfront.",52315,3
52315,But that was because of the laptop.,52315,3
52315,Knocked a star off because there's no interior support.,52315,3
52315,I inserted a basic plastic bottom from another gym bag to firm this one up.,52315,3
52316,"Love the fabric, very soft.",52316,3
52316,Nut fit smaller than expected through Hips/Butt/Stomach,52316,3
52317,Its very cute and came a week early however I ordered size 6 to 12 months and its very big.,52317,3
52317,It says 6 on the tag but is big enough for a to 3 year old.,52317,3
52317,I guess ill hold onto it until then.,52317,3
52317,"Everything else is nice, its not like cotton sweats but maybe polyester cotton.",52317,3
52317,Kinda slippery fabric but its well made.,52317,3
52318,I love it made great fits great.,52318,3
52318,But not for women with bigger bust size if adjusted with the suit the way it's ment to be worn.,52318,3
52319,It's ok. Would like a strap on it too.,52319,3
52320,the fabric is fine but it is NOT floor length it says there maxi skirt and it goes up to me knees!,52320,3
52320,I gave it away :(,52320,3
52321,A bit bulkier than expected.,52321,3
52321,The button snap doesn't work so great.,52321,3
52321,"I like the design - just as pictured, and it's well made",52321,3
52322,Cross bigger than expected.,52322,3
52322,Very cheap looking necklace had to change it,52322,3
52323,I give 3 stars because it's ok.,52323,3
52323,It's really thick but almost too small to fit over my hips.,52323,3
52323,And may still not stay over them.,52323,3
52323,"I haven't worn them yet because it hasn't quite been cold enough yet, but I know I'll have to wear them with leggings in hopes that it'll stay down",52323,3
52324,this is a great dress except the pockets really ruin the lines and don't stay put.,52324,3
52324,I like having the pockets but not the way these affect the lines of the dress.,52324,3
52326,I like the way it fits and the length which runs down the hips.,52326,3
52326,"What I find annoying is that it keeps puckering around the zipper area making it look odd, and it won't flatten out.",52326,3
52327,"They came broken, but the seller is sending me a replacement pair.",52327,3
52327,"They were heavy in weight, so I don't imagine them breaking easy.",52327,3
52327,I'm sure mines was just defective.,52327,3
52327,The glass was very clear.,52327,3
52327,It almost looked like there was no lenses.,52327,3
52328,"Nice, but make sure you order two sizes larger than you'd normally wear.",52328,3
52328,"I normally wear a large, ordered an Extra Large and they are still far too small.",52328,3
52329,This bathing suit just arrived and I was worried about it being too small coming from China.,52329,3
52329,"It surprisingly fits well, but is not made well.",52329,3
52329,"It's made with this weird thin but soft material that isn't really bathing suit material (at least, as we know in America.)",52329,3
52329,"The bottoms I do like, but the top is just kind of a mess.",52329,3
52329,"It's super thin though luckily not see-through (there is padding), and reminds me of a children's swim top.",52329,3
52329,"The picture gave me the impression that it would be a sturdy top with an underwire but it's the complete opposite, very floppy and scrunchy with little to no support.",52329,3
52329,It is also more like a typical triangular bikini top in person.,52329,3
52329,"The colors are not nearly as vibrant as the picture, it looks very washed out and more white than back.",52329,3
52329,I will probably only wear the bottoms with a different top of my own.,52329,3
52329,"Always hoping it looks like the picture but I'm not surprised with the quality at that price I paid,",52329,3
52330,They are ok the material is like a mesh material and looks funny sometimes when it scrunches and the plastic part at the bottom hurts my big toe.,52330,3
52330,The shoes were also a little big on me but other than that they are cute and I like them decently.,52330,3
52332,"I got it way before due time, it's a good idea, could make pretty piece on necktie and shirt.",52332,3
52332,My only regret is I ordered the blue-stone one and I got a clear stone one.,52332,3
52333,its kind of too short and the cross is a bit small to what my expectation was,52333,3
52334,Didn't provide adequate coverage on side of cup,52334,3
52335,Did not end up working for us because they are cut so big and slipped right off babies foot.,52335,3
52336,Cute - but would have been nice to know it was bright pink not IU red,52336,3
52337,I normally wear a medium but these were way too small.,52337,3
52337,I could wear the tights but let's just say they weren't flattering.,52337,3
52337,I like the tights and they seem well made.,52337,3
52337,I plan on ordering a large.,52337,3
52338,"I normally wear a medium, but they only had a small and an extra large available, so I took the gamble on the small.",52338,3
52338,It was a little too small and slightly sheer -  I could see my white tights through the dress.,52338,3
52338,"It was cute, and I could have almost pulled off wearing it.",52338,3
52338,"I have another Allegra K dress that I love, so I'll still buy their clothing in the future, this one just wasn't a good fit.",52338,3
52339,The color is not as bright I was wanting,52339,3
52340,Way too small even though I ordered a larger size,52340,3
52341,I got these for my 11 month old son.,52341,3
52341,"He is a very long and skinny child, so unfortunately these lasted all of about 2 weeks before he grew too long for them (29 1/2"") and now the neck pulls down so far that they're unwearable.",52341,3
52341,The sleeves also only reach about 3/4 of the way down his arms.,52341,3
52341,"However, there is PLENTY of room everywhere else.",52341,3
52341,They're very soft and warm and they washed well.,52341,3
52342,"The rings are ok, they are not a really looking as I would like.",52342,3
52343,Too low of a waist for belt.,52343,3
52344,OK Product but waist was entirely too small for XL I purchased.,52344,3
52344,"Also, like some other commenter, there was an undersell to the jacket but assume that would have faded with wear.",52344,3
52344,Shoulders and arm lengths were fine but waist and chest too small.,52344,3
52345,I think these nipple bars are super cute and had to order them once I saw them on Tumblr.,52345,3
52345,"Although the shipping was very fast, the bars were not as durable as I expected.",52345,3
52345,One of my bars broke within the first week of wearing them.,52345,3
52346,Very cute but the material seemed thin especially for the price.,52346,3
52346,"I ordered a medium and it was too loose and the straps were not adjustable so I had to return I'm 5"" 118lbs",52346,3
52348,"Fits cool, same color as pic.",52348,3
52349,The leg length is pretty short.,52349,3
52349,"I'm 5'4"" and they hit right at my ankle.",52349,3
52349,It took me a little while to figure out the elastic tab.,52349,3
52349,It's come off the button easily and I have to fish it out - especially after washing.,52349,3
52350,"The description says ""stretch"" but it doesn't stretch.",52350,3
52350,"It's too big to wear around the wrist without falling off, and it was too small to keep it up the arm close to the shoulder.",52350,3
52350,The rudraksha seeds themselves are nice but rather big for the wrist.,52350,3
52351,wish it was make some what harger,52351,3
52353,"I'm 5'6""
But it's too long, even I wear high heel, still touches the floor.",52353,3
52353,"Only fit for someone who higher than 5'8""",52353,3
52354,I always buy my son size youth M. This shirt is not a youth M. It's more an adult M. Very disappointed.,52354,3
52355,"Bottoms are a bit small and top is a bit too big, but they are okay enough to keep them.",52355,3
52355,I'm having a problem with the zipper on the top staying up.,52355,3
52355,"It unzips all the way, but hasn't unclipped (yet) and given everyone a show.",52355,3
52355,I don't know if I'm going to be comfortable enough wearing this in public with the zipper not staying up.,52355,3
52355,Giving it a few days to think on it...,52355,3
52355,"Besides all that, the style and look of the suit it super cute and sexy.",52355,3
52355,That matches exactly what I was looking for!,52355,3
52356,"The laces are somewhat stretchy, and are only the advertised length when stretched out (without stretch they're about 3-4 inches shorter).",52356,3
52356,Besides that they're a wonderful colour and seem well made.,52356,3
52357,"Purchased for my teens b-day, the letters could have been a wee bit larger because my child said no one noticed the headband and wished I would have made her a b-day button instead.",52357,3
52358,This pattern on the is very cute.,52358,3
52358,I suggest if you are going to order this get the largest size that is possible even if your normal size is an xs.,52358,3
52358,It also is very thin.,52358,3
52358,I did not return this because it is too much of a hassle.,52358,3
52358,It is somewhat good just make sure to get the biggest size.,52358,3
52359,Ear piece broke after couple  of weeks.,52359,3
52359,Tried to glue it but to no avail.,52359,3
52360,Its OK. No problems with it so far.,52360,3
52361,I got this watch for my daughter and she loved it.,52361,3
52361,"All her friends were jealous of this great looking watch and that is all it is, great looking.",52361,3
52361,"The batteries the watch came with lasted about 3 months, we replaced the batteries.",52361,3
52361,Then about 2 months later the watch completely died.,52361,3
52361,We took it to the watch store and they said it's not fixable.,52361,3
52361,When the watch arrived the directions were a direct translation of Japanese and made no sense.,52361,3
52361,We ended having to buy my daughter another watch.,52361,3
52362,"The bottom is a bit short though so if you raise your arms or tuck the shirt in, it comes out of your skirt/pants and your skin shows up to your mid section.",52362,3
52363,this was not the same design I received the dress I got had alot of differences to the one in the pic was not happy about that,52363,3
52364,It's pretty good if you don't have flab anywhere.,52364,3
52364,"It's quite unforgiving on my 148 pound, 5.3"" figure.",52364,3
52364,It doesn't hide the flab on the sides and the front is not low enough to hide the tummy region.,52364,3
52364,"It's a bright color but the neck at the back is also low that you'd have to wear a thin, low bra strap or it would be seen.",52364,3
52364,"On the positive side, I'm working out so I can fit into this thing.",52364,3
52365,Looks good not extremly comfortable.,52365,3
52365,My hudband has broad shoulders and it was a little struggle in that place to stay on and up.,52365,3
52365,The bottom arm piece is definitly roomy and to prevent slipping off and for comfort we tapped bubble wrap around his arm.,52365,3
52366,I ordered the blue and white one.,52366,3
52366,"I like more how it looks on the hanger than how it does on me, however I received many compliments the first time I wore it to work.",52366,3
52366,It took me a long time to iron all the wrinkles after I took it out of its packaging.,52366,3
52366,I still have to see how it washes.,52366,3
52366,For now it's okay.,52366,3
52367,was a little smaller then i thought but wife still liked it.,52367,3
52368,"Not what I expected, doesn't look much like the photo.",52368,3
52368,"Hard to get in & out of, and I'm skinny.",52368,3
52368,"I'll wear it, but it's high maintenance, also flimsy, not something I can just throw on & go about my day.",52368,3
52368,"Also, there are probably 20 buttons, I had to make buttonholes for 2 of them.",52368,3
52369,Fit just right straight out of the box.,52369,3
52370,Lenses are mirrored and dark.,52370,3
52370,Exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered them.,52370,3
52370,Frames are a clear plastic and a bit small for me.,52370,3
52370,Not what I wanted.,52370,3
52370,I'm a large person so I understand far better than most that one size does NOT fit all.,52370,3
52370,I lose or leave behind a couple pair of sunglasses per year so will certainly keep these and use them until they too disappear into the sunglass abyss.,52370,3
52371,I got for button attachment.,52371,3
52371,It was not easy to use.,52371,3
52372,"didn't know about the elastic backing on the hat(they should've mention that small detail), kind of different then what i'm use to .",52372,3
52372,could get use to it .,52372,3
52373,HUGE is how big this one runs....but love how soft & comfortable it is,52373,3
52374,Fits good and I wear alot,52374,3
52375,But I constantly tried and this item does not seem to glow in the dark like it says above.,52375,3
52375,"But otherwise this is in a fine condition, and a somewhat great product, and I am happy with this item.",52375,3
52376,I bought three of these shirts earlier in the year and loved them so decided to order two more.,52376,3
52376,The new shirts are sized noticeably smaller than the earlier shirts!,52376,3
52376,"So if you're planning to order now, I would consider going up a size.",52376,3
52376,I'll keep these as I love the material and how well they wash up but the fit is just not as comfortable or nice.,52376,3
52376,:(  The shirts in the photo are the same XL size -- you can see the difference between the new blue one and the earlier black one.,52376,3
52376,About 2 inches smaller in length and width!,52376,3
52376,Both the new shirts I purchased on this order were the same smaller size.,52376,3
52377,"This suit has no bra at all in it, so it is very flimsy.",52377,3
52377,"Great for the price, but not something I can wear in public.",52377,3
52378,Not made very strong.,52378,3
52378,They ripped after a few weeks of wearing,52378,3
52379,I like it- it works but it feels like the drawstring to tighten it to the baby's head might break or rip the fabric.,52379,3
52380,"Great value, but the size is for very petite women.",52380,3
52380,I tend to go between 34B - 36B and the bras in XL was too snug.,52380,3
52381,Very lightweight so it broke easy.,52381,3
52382,it is a cute set but the size 6T was just too small.,52382,3
52382,More like a 4T.,52382,3
52383,It was nice but a bit bigger than a small.,52383,3
52384,"It is a good quality and fabric used, but the size chart is not correct.",52384,3
52384,I ordered an XL.,52384,3
52384,"I have ordered from them before and got the right size and it fit perfect, but the last 2 sweatshirts I ordered have been too small, and would possibly fit a small child:(",52384,3
52385,Did not like the quality.,52385,3
52385,Color was true to the photos.,52385,3
52386,Had several strings hanging off and some sequins were loose.,52386,3
52386,Not too much and looked great in the pageant.,52386,3
52386,I would definitely order one again.,52386,3
52387,I do like my YALUXE purse.,52387,3
52387,My only problem is with the closing zipper I don't know whether it will hold up we with every day use.,52387,3
52388,"They are comfy for sleep, but don't count on them for any substantial support.",52388,3
52389,Cute but VERY  tight fit.,52389,3
52389,only for petite body types,52389,3
52390,"Liked it better in pic, not as expected have returned it.",52390,3
52391,It stretches & doesn't fit as well after you wear it for a while.,52391,3
52392,"I'm 5' 7"" and will definitely have to wear legging under this or everyone will get a view if I bend over too far...",52392,3
52393,Torn between 3 and 4 stars.,52393,3
52393,These are certainly warm enough for an average cold day and it wasn't too hard to get them on.,52393,3
52393,But they were just a little too small for my 2.5 year old.,52393,3
52393,They would be good for 18mos - 2 yo.,52393,3
52393,But not sure you could get gloves on an 18 month old.,52393,3
52394,These sweatpants are so weird.,52394,3
52394,I bought them to go do errands on lazy days but I don't think i'll wear them other than sleeping.,52394,3
52394,"The waist is smaller than expected, and the actual leg part is so baggy it looks like i'm wearing genie pants.",52394,3
52394,"If you want comfy sweatpants to sleep in, than these are it but I do not plan on wearing these in public even on snow days LOL",52394,3
52395,Within one week the lining on the zipper pocket was ripped.,52395,3
52395,"Bag still usable, upsetting that it isn't better quality.",52395,3
52396,"I liked the fit overall, but didn't like the way the fabric laid around the bust.",52396,3
52396,"I loved the style and the fabric was stretchy so it fit nicely, but the fabric that encircles the bust crisscross area didn't lay the way I expected,  I wanted to like it but it just didn't work for me.",52396,3
52397,Need to exchange for a larger size.,52397,3
52397,I need a XXL....,52397,3
52398,"Butterfly a little too big, but OK.",52398,3
52399,it looks nice but runs much smaller.,52399,3
52399,you'll need at least one size up if not two.,52399,3
52400,I ordered a large but its too small I Love the material and the look but its too small,52400,3
52401,too short and thin for my liking.,52401,3
52402,Runs really small but looks as pictured,52402,3
52403,I got these and they look really nice.,52403,3
52403,However only the black agate plugs were 6g the other two were 4g.,52403,3
52403,But all in all great product just didn't recieve all 6g.,52403,3
52404,"Sleeves are a little tight when moving arms, but otherwise  It's a pretty decent product.",52404,3
52405,The posts are very short.,52405,3
52405,I would only recommend this for you girls,52405,3
52406,But fit small and I couldn't get it to flip up in front like the picture.,52406,3
52407,"I ordered a large and it is still too small, especially after  washing and hanging to dry.",52407,3
52407,It shrunk about 2 sizes.,52407,3
52408,I was slightly disappointed on how tight with the shirts are.,52408,3
52409,I would say it is a full size off in the chinese conversion,52409,3
52410,Pretty but not big enough on top but the length is perfect,52410,3
52411,"Let's start with the positives: I really like them, they are very cute, nice quality for the price I paid, not heavy, shiny and you can slightly expand them some.",52411,3
52411,"Unfortunately, they don't quite fit me.",52411,3
52411,I always thought I had small nips but apparently not small enough.,52411,3
52411,You know how a nose ring clips on?,52411,3
52411,Well that's what this looks like.,52411,3
52411,"After I struggle to put them on, the top of them actually ""clip"" on to my nipples and they look like if they were pierced.",52411,3
52411,It looks really cute but unfortunately it was uncomfortable for me.,52411,3
52411,I kept them on for about an hour until one fell off.,52411,3
52411,Not wearable for me but maybe for you ok.,52411,3
52412,I bought these specifically for my tragus.,52412,3
52412,"It fits through, but is VERY difficult to get the ball on.",52412,3
52412,I have to wear them backwards which is no fun.,52412,3
52412,these should not come up or be advertised as for the tragus.,52412,3
52413,Nice top but came w a little hole in it that I didn't see til after I cut tags off and ironed it.,52413,3
52413,"If you are busty, order a size up because that part runs small.",52413,3
52414,Cute shirt but the back looks different from the picture and the bow isn't the same color :-),52414,3
52415,"I love the size, look, sleekness, comfort, etc.",52415,3
52415,"the only thing I don't like is it is a little ""wimpy"".",52415,3
52415,Meaning while its in your pocket the hinge gets tweaked and then it doesn't close right until you bend it back into place?,52415,3
52416,"These are very very stretchy, almost too stretchy.",52416,3
52416,They do not stay up where they are placed and I had to keep pulling them up all day long.,52416,3
52416,"They are not very soft and while not itchy, are not nearly as comfortable as I had hoped.",52416,3
52416,"They are ok, but I won't be purchasing again.",52416,3
52417,"Returned, plastic cheap looking.",52417,3
52417,Went with a couple jar rings and it looked better,52417,3
52418,"Looks better in picture, Challenge to adjust.",52418,3
52418,Supplier was very prompt with my concern and refunded.,52418,3
52419,These sandals are not a 5 but not a 1 either.,52419,3
52419,I give them a 3.,52419,3
52419,The front strap is a lil large but nothing I can't handle.,52419,3
52419,The heel is quite comfortable .,52419,3
52419,Only time will tell on whether they wear as well as the heel projects.,52419,3
52420,item was too large for a one year child and hat was too small.,52420,3
52420,Material is very thin,52420,3
52421,"You get what you pay for quality wise, the sizes run small.",52421,3
52421,"I wear a medium and have medium in other robes, but this one I needed a large and still felt it was very short.",52421,3
52421,"I ended up ordering 7 of these for bridesmaids, and after they arrived I was disappointed in the sizes, they just run small and fit oddly in places.",52421,3
52421,Product shipped promptly and arrived on time.,52421,3
52423,I like the color and style...not very durable.,52423,3
52423,One handle for the long strap broke off and another for the short strap is hanging by the threads.,52423,3
52423,I have stop using it.,52423,3
52424,This jacket is very small for the size.,52424,3
52424,The fleece is heavier than I expected from the description.,52424,3
52424,I like Columbia products but have found their sizing not consistent.,52424,3
52425,Fabric is flimsy and feels like a bed sheet.,52425,3
52425,Very different shade of yellow than I expected it to be.,52425,3
52425,Fit very well though.,52425,3
52426,"Its ok , real plain, took forever to arrive",52426,3
52428,I would have given it 4-5 stars but I don't love the zipper at the top.,52428,3
52428,It doesn't zip down all the way or anything but I wish it had an extra fastening hook at the top just in case.,52428,3
52428,I love the side coverage and the back is great for tank tops.,52428,3
52429,"It is alright, but way to big for Mt 6 /12 wrist",52429,3
52430,The other reviews did say that this ran large.,52430,3
52430,"However, I am usually an extra large so I ordered a large, the larger is actually still a bit big.",52430,3
52430,I am keeping the large because I am afraid the medium will end up being to small.,52430,3
52430,Also the garter straps are long.,52430,3
52431,"The design was blurry, but my husband loved the message, so it was still a win.",52431,3
52431,But it definitely was cheaper quality printing.,52431,3
52432,"Not very nice quality, too long.",52432,3
52432,They are o k though.,52432,3
52433,"The flower off about a week after it came in, but for the price you pay, it isn't too bad.",52433,3
52434,Fits a bit smaller than my normal size.,52434,3
52435,"The color was great and the fabric was nice, but the suit was way too big and I had to turn it and bought four locally, because of the convenience of returning them quickly.",52435,3
52435,"After they received my return, they waited 30 days to issue a refund to my amazon account.",52435,3
52435,Wong use them again,52435,3
52436,"The bottoms were great, but they are a bit revealing.",52436,3
52436,The top fit is a bit big and does not look as nice as the picture and is a little difficult to wear.,52436,3
52438,I use these strictly to help pick up the trajectory of the ball on the courts...........it helps for sure but a bit spendy,52438,3
52439,I ordered a size large.,52439,3
52439,They were too small so I gave them away.,52439,3
52439,When I took them out the bag they looked like a small/med.,52439,3
52440,The quality was good.,52440,3
52440,Material was breathable but definitely not 100% cotton.,52440,3
52440,The sizes also run smaller than expected.,52440,3
52440,"Neither would I buy them again, nor recommend them to anyone.",52440,3
52441,"great product quality, but size runs too small",52441,3
52442,It's a light coat.,52442,3
52442,Not durable to withstand multiple uses.,52442,3
52442,It OK if you'll wear it a handful of times.,52442,3
52443,"I am 5'0, I weigh around 110, so you can imagine I'm kinda small.",52443,3
52443,I was shocked to find that this skirt was WAY too small for me!,52443,3
52443,The inner lining made me feel like I slid into a sausage casing!,52443,3
52443,"The outer lace skirt is gorgeous, so I'll just adapt it to my size.",52443,3
52444,The Wonder women custom was great.,52444,3
52444,Well made and the fabric was nice.,52444,3
52444,The size was a little to big for me even thought I follow the size chart provided by the seller.,52444,3
52444,The only thing that wasn't nice was amazon return policy.,52444,3
52444,The seller say that they accept return all you have to do is print the return paper from amazon.,52444,3
52444,I try but wasn't very successful.,52444,3
52444,But the wonder women custom was great and the price was great.,52444,3
52445,It's really cute but more of a top than a dress,52445,3
52446,I really like my navy blue tote.,52446,3
52446,Unfortunately it's been about a month and the outside is starting to chip off.,52446,3
52446,If you use only once in a while totally worth it otherwise maybe not durable enough for everyday use.,52446,3
52447,"My fault, I didn't check the fit guidelines.",52447,3
52447,I ordered a 2X but it fits like about a medium (12).,52447,3
52447,Product is nice though.,52447,3
52448,Fit me tighter than most medium shirts I wear.,52448,3
52448,"It is okay, but I would not have bought if I tried it on first.",52448,3
52449,It just doesn't fit the way I thought.,52449,3
52449,"It's tighter than I expected, even though I followed the size chart.",52449,3
52449,I would recommend ordering up.,52449,3
52449,I feel like it show lumps and bumps because of the sizing and the fabric.,52449,3
52449,I wish I could like it!,52449,3
52450,"Too small, mainly due to the type of material.",52450,3
52452,The belt appears to be made from thick quality leather and the zipper pouch works as advertised.,52452,3
52452,I really like the way the belt looked and functioned until the prong broke off the frame of the buckle after only FOUR DAYS of wearing it.,52452,3
52452,"I am 6'3"" tall and weigh 190 pounds so I don't have a big belly hanging over putting undue stress on the belt.",52452,3
52452,I wear a belt every day and have never broken a belt or buckle.,52452,3
52452,It must have had a flaw in the metal where the prong attached to the frame.,52452,3
52452,"On the bright side, the belt comes with snaps to attach the buckle.",52452,3
52452,"Since I really like the belt, I will keep it and put another buckle on it.",52452,3
52452,I would have given it five stars if the buckle hadn't broken.,52452,3
52453,"This is alright, rather thin but great for spring.",52453,3
52454,These are great at keeping your ears warm.,52454,3
52454,The only drawback I have is that they are smaller than I would like and barely wrap around to cover all of my ears.,52454,3
52454,I think the next pair I buy will be the ones that expand or contract to fit different size heads.,52454,3
52454,These are 1 size and do not expand at all.,52454,3
52455,Looks great smells awful,52455,3
52457,not bad at all really.,52457,3
52457,I travel a lot.,52457,3
52457,This kit provided me with simple reliable travel convenience.,52457,3
52457,"It wasn't earth shattering, but it will do",52457,3
52458,I am very disappointed.,52458,3
52458,The tulle is more like mosquito netting,52458,3
52459,Runs small but is a beautiful dress!,52459,3
52460,Awesome shirt just a tad too small.,52460,3
52461,I should have ordered a bigger size.,52461,3
52461,I wear 8 and 10 in pants and ordered a 12 in this and it is pretty tight.,52461,3
52463,Was super excited for this wallet.,52463,3
52463,However I was disappointed in the excecution.,52463,3
52463,The clip that holds the lanyard on it broke off the first week with just a small car key and a house key on it... Much sadness.,52463,3
52463,The rubber on the inside of the strap to keep your cards in place is coming off.,52463,3
52463,"The thing I dislike the most about the wallet is its too small to store cash folded twice so you have to fold all bills three times to get them in there..

Don't have a problem with anything falling out.",52463,3
52463,Overall it's an improvement from the bulky trifold i used to have but the shoddy materials keep it from being 'high quality' or the last wallet I'll buy.,52463,3
52464,A better quality the quality was very cheap,52464,3
52465,Fangs were too big,52465,3
52466,This fits right for the special occasion that I wanted it for.,52466,3
52466,I will probably buy in another color.,52466,3
52467,Doll clothes perfect but the girl pants are way too large for a sz 10 - I have to do major alterations.,52467,3
52467,The girl's top is fine!,52467,3
52467,I do like the outfit very much.,52467,3
52468,"Was very big, my daughter still has not grown into it.",52468,3
52470,Got misshapen after washing,52470,3
52471,"These are ok, they scratched very easily and hubby says they just aren't the same as Costas own lenses.",52471,3
52471,But they sufficed for the time being and fit well in his frames.,52471,3
52472,Good enough for my kid,52472,3
52473,Great swimsuit unfortunately is for taller ladies.,52473,3
52473,"It fit great everywhere else, colors, material and quality were awesome but I'm 5' 1"" and I had all this extra material in the torso",52473,3
52474,"I am 5'9"" and 170 lbs (size 12/14), and a size M/L was about four inches too short.",52474,3
52474,Returning in hopes that the next size up will fit as expected.,52474,3
52474,"Also, the violet looks more berry/wine in the photos than it really is.",52474,3
52475,This garment has no stitching anywhere.,52475,3
52475,Luckily the fabric doesn't seem to fray.,52475,3
52475,"It looks great on with jeans, I was expecting some type of tayloring.",52475,3
52476,Nice has real cloverleaf's didn't expect that for the money.,52476,3
52477,"In the pic It looked like it would fit bigger,..I would have ordered a size up.",52477,3
52477,the shirt is scratchy and itchy .,52477,3
52478,I like the material and all they are just a snug large,52478,3
52479,"I liked it, but the chain was little balls instead of loops.",52479,3
52480,"I love the ncklace design and dimension, however, there is no backing to the emblem, exposing the inside materials to any and all damages to the inside.",52480,3
52481,"It is ""cute"" .. but, the purple is next to impossible to see .. not impressed.",52481,3
52481,I had purchased several charms for my Pandora bracelet and when I opened it I did not realize it was the purple one until I came on line to see my orders and noticed it was delivered today.,52481,3
52481,"Only then, did I see the purple if I squinted really really hard.",52481,3
52481,I was hesitant to even give it 3 stars :(,52481,3
52482,"The scarf is ok, but be prepared to wait an eternity for it to arrive.",52482,3
52483,"Order one size up from normal for a streamlined, slim look and fit.",52483,3
52483,Order two sizes larger if you'd like a baggier fit or to be able to wear a sweater under it.,52483,3
52484,I wanted to wear this out on South Beach Miami....I ended up taking it to a Disney trip and wearing it to the pool.,52484,3
52484,The material was okay and so was the dress.,52484,3
52484,It wasn't that HOT....unlike the picture shown to the customers!,52484,3
52484,"It was ok, but I wouldn't purchase again.",52484,3
52485,Mine did not look like the picture.,52485,3
52485,It was missing dots on the front and the arms appear attached to the side like wings but were not like that.,52485,3
52486,They broke after 2 days.,52486,3
52486,The company took them back (In transit at the moment).,52486,3
52486,Awaiting a replacement pair.,52486,3
52487,It worked but the heart opened often so not after long my fiance dropped it without even knowing,52487,3
52488,Good for the price.,52488,3
52489,100% cotton so it will shrink when washed and dried.,52489,3
52489,"The shirt is great quality, however.",52489,3
52490,"Good quality leather, fits well",52490,3
52491,"for the price it's doable, the quality is just okay.",52491,3
52494,I like this belt but I was hoping it would look more like leather but maybe with time it will get worn in and look like that.,52494,3
52495,Nice desing BUT THE material is regular,52495,3
52496,"Socks are sure cute, but they have an odd fit.",52496,3
52496,"Wearable, but unusual fit and feel.",52496,3
52497,The product I was sent was not the correct item at all.,52497,3
52497,I did however try it one and it fit well but it wasn't my style at all so I will be returning it,52497,3
52498,Ought be more in the $15 range.,52498,3
52498,"It's, essentially, just a big t-shirt.",52498,3
52499,Too tall to wear with most my jeans.,52499,3
52500,The sweater is so cute!,52500,3
52500,"I ordered a size XL, I usually fit a medium, it arrived early and it fits perfect.",52500,3
52500,I recommend ordering 2 sizes up.,52500,3
52500,Other than the size being off I love the sweater.,52500,3
52501,runs a little small,52501,3
52502,My husband can't put cash in it with his cards.,52502,3
52503,It was too small for me.,52503,3
52503,I'm normally a medium and I believe I bought a medium.,52503,3
52503,Always get a size bigger.,52503,3
52504,This is fine for the price.,52504,3
52504,"it runs a bit small and it looks okay, but for the price what do you expect?",52504,3
52504,Its not as pretty as in the picture and is not a ring you want to wear to wash your hands.,52504,3
52504,Its just another piece of cheap custom jewelry.,52504,3
52504,Do you really need the clutter?,52504,3
52505,"I expected it to fit more snug, perhaps I should have only order 1",52505,3
52506,I run between a small and a medium.,52506,3
52506,Smalls are usually tight in the bust and mediums are usually baggy in the waist.,52506,3
52506,I ordered a medium and it's too tight in the arms and the shoulders.,52506,3
52506,"I'm not exactly shaped like a linebacker, so I find that odd.",52506,3
52506,The rest of the sweater fits like a small.,52506,3
52506,I'm going to order it in a large and see what happens.,52506,3
52506,"Aside from the size, I like the jacket.",52506,3
52506,"It's thick and warm and seems to be well made, although I haven't had it long so I don't know how well it will hold up over time.",52506,3
52506,"Edit: After receiving the Large and trying it on, it's still constricting in the shoulders, but now it's huge in the body.",52506,3
52506,"It's like, when they designed the sizes, they only accounted for growth in the waist and nowhere else.",52506,3
52506,"I wrapped a measuring tape around my shoulders and they measure just under 42 inches, so if you have shoulders smaller than mine, you'll probably be fine.",52506,3
52506,"Otherwise, don't expect to star in any Rocky Balboa montages, as this sweater is not designed for those maneuvers.",52506,3
52507,I'm rather disappointed in this cap.,52507,3
52507,"I wear newsboy caps often, and this one has that little side flip that I thought gave it some spunk, something a bit different.",52507,3
52507,It sits on my head like it really doesn't want to be there.,52507,3
52507,"It rides on top of my ears, but doesn't cover them.",52507,3
52507,The adjustable drawstring is just that; a string that runs around the inside.,52507,3
52507,The saucy little pin on the side is a cheap stitched on gold metal bow.,52507,3
52507,I cheapens the whole look.,52507,3
52507,"The material is nice, it is well made, just not made to fit on your head.",52507,3
52509,somewhat large but a beautiful dress overall.,52509,3
52510,The shoulders are much poofier than the picture suggests.,52510,3
52511,Beautiful however much larger than I expected!,52511,3
52511,Kept them for dressy occasion just would like half its size.,52511,3
52512,like it very much.,52512,3
52512,Tje problem is that it smells strange.,52512,3
52512,I had to wash it before wear it.,52512,3
52513,"Love this product, but it's not made for tall people.",52513,3
52513,It all fit well except it's way to tight between your legs.,52513,3
52513,I'm tall with a long torso causing it to give a seriously uncomfortable camel toe.,52513,3
52514,Thought it was it was underwire so there is not much support.,52514,3
52514,And I am a size 9 pants and after reading the reviews got 2 sizes bigger which is an XXL.,52514,3
52514,My torso isn't super long and the swimsuit torso is even shorter so that's my biggest disappointment.,52514,3
52514,Also while not a huge deal and can fix myself the straps keep coming undone.,52514,3
52514,And I have no butt at all and the V butt which didn't show in the pics and it is quite irritating.,52514,3
52514,I am almost 30 and no one wants to see that.,52514,3
52514,"I also have a son that if a play at all, it goes up my butt.",52514,3
52515,"After washing, it shrunk.",52515,3
52515,"This brand normally runs a little big for me, which I like,  but not this top.",52515,3
52515,I also didn't like the way it looked on.,52515,3
52515,"Good price, so I'll wear it around the house.",52515,3
52516,I rate this item a 3 because i ordered 4 and only 2 of the pencil case was in great shape and the other 2 the pencil case had dents on both ends.,52516,3
52516,They are very cute and is worth the money.,52516,3
52517,They are real cute but were tight on my daughter's feet.,52517,3
52517,She couldn't wear then long.,52517,3
52517,Runs a little small,52517,3
52518,the little feather  fall off easily.,52518,3
52519,My son loves these but they run a bit small.,52519,3
52520,"I ordered a size down, as it was recommended.",52520,3
52520,My only complaint is that it sometimes stabs me in the armpit area when I wear it and it can be very uncomfortable to the point that I have to take it off.,52520,3
52521,I'm 5'6 100lbs and ordered a small.,52521,3
52521,"The bottoms fit good, the tank fits good, but the bikini top is a joke.",52521,3
52521,It's too small in some areas and way too big in others.,52521,3
52521,It fits too high up and is too big around to hold anything in correctly.,52521,3
52521,It has zero support so the girls just fall out the bottom.,52521,3
52521,Only one part of the straps is adjustable.,52521,3
52521,The criss-cross straps aren't adjustable at all and ride up really high on my back.,52521,3
52521,"I'll keep the whole thing because I like the bottoms and the tank, but I'm going to have to go buy a top to go under it that somewhat matches.",52521,3
52523,"Its ok, nothing to write hone about.",52523,3
52524,I purchased this as a Valentine present for my husband who doesn't normally wear jewelry.,52524,3
52524,It looked great on him and I was pleasantly surprised when he wanted to wear it out on special occasions.,52524,3
52524,"Unfortunately, after a approximately the third wear, it has broken.",52524,3
52524,The braided part of the bracelet has come undone from the fastener.,52524,3
52525,Need to add instructions for the putting on the top looks like a scarf,52525,3
52526,"Neat designs, a little on the small side.",52526,3
52527,I wish the small/med fit tighter around the waist.,52527,3
52528,"its ok, clothing comes from China",52528,3
52529,Was nice the first couple weeks I used it but started to fall apart after a couple washes.,52529,3
52529,Helped me from having to buy a bunch of maternity jeans.,52529,3
52530,I like the blue color and the style.,52530,3
52530,I ordered an XL but it fits more like a Large and rides up a bit in the back.,52530,3
52531,looks like the picture only problem the clasp was broken when i received it,52531,3
52532,"They seem well made, but the print was off mine were mostly pink?",52532,3
52532,That was really disappointing didn't have that galaxy effect because of it.,52532,3
52532,"I sized up two sizes and while it fits okay I should have only sized up one size, but was going off the reviews.",52532,3
52532,Pretty good leggings for the price but bad print placement.,52532,3
52532,"I had thought of returning because of the size not being as expected and the print being really off but I am going to keep them, it isn't worth the time to send them back.",52532,3
52533,Cute socks but the fit is a little small.,52533,3
52533,The boys don't care though and wear them anyway.,52533,3
52534,It's a good sun shade,52534,3
52535,The panties that arrived did not match the picture at all.,52535,3
52535,"I got a 5-pack with a plain pink with red paisley-floral pattern, a plain blue panty, blue with blue paisley-floral, and a plain lavender.",52535,3
52535,None had an ivory lace pattern.,52535,3
52535,I chose not to return them because of the hassle it would entail.,52535,3
52536,Its a little short for a man...I will give to my sister who loves crabbing.,52536,3
52537,Love how I can style the straps how I want.,52537,3
52537,You can see side boob with this jumper but it's not too bad.,52537,3
52537,"I'm 5'7"" & 130lbs & usually i wear a S or M. I bought this in M & it fits great.",52537,3
52537,02/07/17 was saving this for my January trip to Puerto Rico.,52537,3
52537,"When I put it on, the seam was ripped on the side.",52537,3
52537,Only way I would be able to cover it is if I had my hands by my side the wholenight.,52537,3
52537,"I can sew it myself, but I'm disappointed that I have to alter it before I can wear it & disappointed I wasn't able to wear it in PR for my birthday.",52537,3
52538,"Really pretty dress ,I like that it has stretch to it,but the half sleeves are blech!!",52538,3
52538,"The description says ""cap sleeves""  but it is false.",52538,3
52538,Fits more like a 1X then a 2X.,52538,3
52538,I always wear a 2X in dresses but had to break out the spank to wear this one.,52538,3
52539,very  pretty  but...dont  like  the  fact  it  didn't  stretch!& they  didn't  refund  the  full  amount  of  MONEY TO  ME...... !,52539,3
52540,"Love the design, but it was too heavy to be held in my hair by just a clip.",52540,3
52540,Would have been 5 stars if it had headband option.,52540,3
52541,Will work as a costume for the play.,52541,3
52541,Light-weight polyester fabric with a zipper.,52541,3
52541,Better construction than most of this 60's Go Go style.,52541,3
52542,"Nice color, fun, innovative.",52542,3
52543,"The dress is pretty, but looser than I expected.",52543,3
52543,"I am 5'6 and 160 lbs (usually a size 8), I bought a large and it wasn't very tight.",52543,3
52543,"Be ware, the dress is see through in the back, but when it's on you can't really tell.",52543,3
52545,Nice dress except for the front opening at the hem which was too revealing for a more modest lady.,52545,3
52546,very cheap~loose threads everywhere~and the smell~i immediately washed it in woolite I hope it takes that smell out!!!,52546,3
52546,I don't  think if you are anything bigger than a size small you would want to order this it's teeny tiny tight!!,52546,3
52547,This dress would have been a 5 star but it fail big on one thing.,52547,3
52547,the inner part of the neck both front and back keeps coming out.,52547,3
52547,which means that you have to keep adjusting.,52547,3
52547,If seller could maybe sew the neck all round to prevents the inner part from keep coming out it will be great.,52547,3
52547,Beautiful dress but i don't like the way the neck comes out.,52547,3
52547,I bought a medium thinking the neck was coming out because it was too tight.,52547,3
52547,so i returned the M and got a Large.,52547,3
52547,but i'm still experiencing the same thing.,52547,3
52547,I will keep the dress because I like it and will look for a needle and fix the neck.,52547,3
52547,Also this dress will be more elegant with great fit if the shoulders had like some pads.,52547,3
52547,with the shoulds just being too flat it does not brings out the beauty of the dress.,52547,3
52547,I will personally adjust this dress the way that it will look elegant.,52547,3
52548,I initially got this watch for my brother and her really liked it.,52548,3
52548,One down side is that it was not that durable.,52548,3
52548,"After about a month, the nub on the side that was used to change the time fell off.",52548,3
52548,Still a great cosplay piece!,52548,3
52549,Latch didn't work well.,52549,3
52550,This necklace is cute but the color is not white.,52550,3
52550,"The daisys are a faint pink maybe a blush, so it doesn't match the dress I had plan on wearing with it.",52550,3
52550,"My package arrived a week early.. Other than that, it was a great price.",52550,3
52551,Nice looking hat but a bit small,52551,3
52553,The pant are a little small.,52553,3
52553,So I have to adjust the pant.,52553,3
52554,Order size up but other than that cute,52554,3
52555,This swimsuit is seriously hot so mentally prepare yourself before you wear it.,52555,3
52555,"I have 36D's and normally wear a large, so the side-boob was real in this swimsuit.",52555,3
52555,It is also a little cheeky and pretty sheer when wet so it was perfect for Vegas but for around the pool at home- I don't think so.,52555,3
52555,Be careful to wash right after you wear it though.,52555,3
52555,"Mine got this yellow cast on it, I wasn't sure if it was because it was made of cheap materials or if it was because I didn't wash it right when I got out of it for the day.",52555,3
52556,"Not a huge fan of this necklace, as the chain is very uncomfortable to wear.",52556,3
52556,"The package also smelled a little funny when it came in, but I guess that's what you expect for the price.",52556,3
52557,Long enough but a little snug,52557,3
52558,"Dress is beautiful, the size is wrong is to small and the slip in to high, I returned for a larger size.",52558,3
52559,Doesn't fit as I expected but I will wear it to the gym,52559,3
52560,I like the blouse however it was too big I ordered 6-?,52560,3
52561,Has a large pull in the fabric on the top back of the shirt.,52561,3
52561,I'll be returning it.,52561,3
52563,the color was totally different I was expecting more of a teal blue not a deep darker blue,52563,3
52564,Stretchy but not as much as I would like.,52564,3
52564,I have thicker thighs and I have to hike them up every once in a while.,52564,3
52564,Color is dark gray instead of black,52564,3
52565,Pretty sure it's going to turn my neck green but what do you expect for $20,52565,3
52566,"Waist was fine, but they're definitely ultra low rise",52566,3
52569,I ordered a Medium thinking small was going to be too short and length wise it fits perfect but its a bit on the loose side too.,52569,3
52569,Looks really nice as long as you wear with nude underware since the fabric is very light.,52569,3
52569,Over all i like it and feel very comfortable with it,52569,3
52570,"the earring wer very small not as big as shoen in the pic, but it was looking pretty",52570,3
52571,2 of the shirts were noticeably shorter than the rest.,52571,3
52572,Just as how the picture is !,52572,3
52573,Didn't like the material but nice cut,52573,3
52574,Feb. 2017 Update -- Updated from 5 starts to 3 starts.,52574,3
52574,The credit card pocket lining ripped about two months ago.,52574,3
52574,"I still like the rest of the purse very much but during daily use, I still accidentally use the card pocket with the ripped lining and then think I've misplaced my credit card.",52574,3
52574,I want to love this purse but the quality of the craftsmanship is what I feared -- average of a cheap knockoff at best.,52574,3
52574,I'll be looking for a replacement with higher quality lining/craftsmanship.,52574,3
52574,Original Review -- I was worried about the reasonable price vs. the claim of genuine leather.,52574,3
52574,"However I've had my clutch for a few months now, have used it every day and really, really like it.",52574,3
52574,I love the camel color and it is genuine leather (although a lower quality leather).,52574,3
52574,"The lining is very thin and I'm worried the pockets won't hold up well, but so far so good.",52574,3
52574,"If the lining becomes an issue, I'll update the review.",52574,3
52574,"Overall, I'm very pleased for the price, the functionality, and the looks of the clutch!",52574,3
52574,I get compliments about once a week and a colleague even purchased the exact same purse for his wife's birthday.,52574,3
52575,"Decent every day size, plain design.",52575,3
52576,Really cute outfit but so disappointed because sizing is SOOOO off.,52576,3
52576,"I ordered ""0-3"" and it's more like size 12 months!",52576,3
52576,Super sad because I was going to give this as a gift for a going home outfit.,52576,3
52576,Definitely cannot fit a newborn.,52576,3
52577,"I really like the concept/design, however it runs a little large.",52577,3
52577,the legs rise up as well.,52577,3
52577,I prefer the super elastic belly material over these.,52577,3
52577,If you don't like the super elastic polyester material these are for you.,52577,3
52577,"There is a nice button ""sizer""/adjuster on the insude but mine always comes undone and always ends up deep inside the leggings, which is annoying.",52577,3
52577,"I stopped wearing them because of that, if I didn't bring a tool with me wearing them outside, they would fall off of me.",52577,3
52577,"I bought a large, I normally wear a medium, I should have got the medium, so its true to size for the most part.",52577,3
52579,Was looking for something modest for outdoor watersports (ie kayaking).,52579,3
52579,"Shipped and arrived as expected, and the pattern is super cute.",52579,3
52579,"My only complaint, which may prevent me from wearing it very often, is that it's lacking the 'tightening' effect that most suits have.",52579,3
52579,Not sure if the sizing is off or if it's just a really really low spandex quotient.,52579,3
52579,More like a silky tank with shelf bra.,52579,3
52580,Runs short... Be sure to layer a dark cami or tank under.,52580,3
52581,"Bought this to go with the terrible Tendol monofin ""newest design""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tendol-trade-New-Design-Mermaid-Swimming-Fin-High-Quality-Purple/dp/B018DHDHMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tendol&trade;New Design Mermaid Swimming Fin, High Quality.",52581,3
52581,(Purple)</a>&nbsp;which broke after 5 minutes.,52581,3
52581,"This suit's material is attractive, stretchy and seems good quality.",52581,3
52581,"It seems to run a bit large as I bought the ""4-6"" it for our 5.5 yr old who is average for her age and the top of the tail could have served as the bikini as well, coming almost to her armpits.",52581,3
52581,"Even so, because it is spandex it held pretty well and didn't look grossly outsized.",52581,3
52581,"Even our 3.5 yr old, who is a bit big for her age, can use it pretty well.",52581,3
52581,The opening on the bottom worked well to put on fin and then cover it and stayed on well while swimming.,52581,3
52581,The biggest issue with the suit is that its shiny material starts to flake off quickly when brushing against the side of pool or sitting on pool step.,52581,3
52581,"In addition, the stitching on the corner of the tail, where there is the most stress because of it holding the fin in tight, started coming apart after the first use.",52581,3
52581,I would think something handmade would have better quality.,52581,3
52581,Perhaps if they used a thicker thread it would help.,52581,3
52581,"If this were half the price, I wouldnt mind, but is expensive for something to start falling apart that soon.",52581,3
52581,"All in all, I recommend paying just a little more  and getting the complete Fin Fun mermaid tail and monofin set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fin-Fun-Mermaid-Tail-Fin-Fun-Monofin-Aussie-Green-Size-Child-8/dp/B00KOAS4BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fin Fun Mermaid Tail, Fin Fun Monofin, Aussie Green, Size Child 8</a>.",52581,3

52583,"I found it pretty annoying, but it helped to keep up my more annoying maternity pants.",52583,3
52583,It also helped to mask the navy blue of my maternity pants under lighter colored tops.,52583,3
52583,"I wouldn't buy it again, though.",52583,3
52584,"Material : Perfect
Price : Good
Color : Good",52584,3
52585,"The hat appears to be a normal size in the photo, but when it arrived, it was much longer than expected.",52585,3
52585,It is a little bit bunchy at the top because it's just too long for my head.,52585,3
52585,"I ended up returning it because it was too long (also because it was darker than I thought it would be, but the size played the most significant role in that)",52585,3
52586,"Didn't fit, gave it to my brother.",52586,3
52587,Order up a size or 2 and can definitely wear with legging,52587,3
52588,"I got the brown one with the gold H, but the back clap part is Silver.. kind of odd.",52588,3
52589,The paper airplane is cute.,52589,3
52589,Kind of upset I recieved the wrong infinity necklace though.,52589,3
52589,But I think my little sister with still like them.,52589,3
52590,Cute but too loose.,52590,3
52590,They will fall off my head if I shake my head.,52590,3
52590,Also not good for actually protecting your eyes from the sunlight.,52590,3
52591,It doesn't look like that at all (flater and not so airy looking.,52591,3
52592,I got it in support of my Son in the ARMY!!,52592,3
52592,It could be a little bigger,52592,3
52593,Loved it but it's just too small.,52593,3
52593,What I've found with most of these imported coats is that they are sized to fit MUCH smaller than the typical sizes found in US stores.,52593,3
52594,Very Cute much smaller than expected,52594,3
52595,Thin material and very short.,52595,3
52595,Cute as a top!,52595,3
52596,"It was my fault, I ordered a 3x, when I should have oredred a2x.",52596,3
52596,"It light ,comfortable,and nice color.",52596,3
52597,The cotton blend Perry Ellis polo fit as expected.,52597,3
52597,Very please with the fit and quality of the product.,52597,3
52598,Good quality but small!,52598,3
52599,"Have purchased same jacket in another color, but this one has the sizing wrong.",52599,3
52600,This fit as expected but was not the exact swimsuit show in the picture.,52600,3
52600,The coloring is off and there are a few small detail changes that I noticed and forced me to return the suit because I didn't like it anymore.,52600,3
52601,Pom Pom fell off within a week or so and couldn't attach it back on...,52601,3
52601,Disappointed but while it lasted it was super cute.,52601,3
52602,"The shirt fits perfectly, but the pants are too long and too big around the waist.",52602,3
52602,We are saving them for when he grows into them.,52602,3
52603,Not low rise as i would have expected.,52603,3
52603,"Somewhat short as well, when you sit down you may  have some issues.",52603,3
52603,Would not buy again but probably will not return as well.,52603,3
52603,Most likely will go in my underwear drawer and will use occasionally but will not make the daily routine.,52603,3
52604,I'm a size 7 in jeans and the medium was too small so then I ordered a large and it is still somewhat small which I expected but they're not that bad.,52604,3
52604,My only problem is they smell pretty weird is there a way to get rid of the odor without ruining them???,52604,3
52605,These shoes had a sharp edge on the thong that rubbed the top of my feet.,52605,3
52605,My husband had to sand them to make them comfortable.,52605,3
52605,They do not have the same design or logo as other flip flop shoes I own from this same manufacturer.,52605,3
52605,One thong already pulled through the shoe and I have not had them for very long.,52605,3
52605,"I was able to repair, but I have flip flops that I have worn for years with no issues.",52605,3
52607,It does look like the picture and is a cute bracelet however I thought it was a bunch of individual bracelets that colors could be worn individually.,52607,3
52608,Very nice and does what it is supposed to!!,52608,3
52608,Only issue I have is the metal edge on the inside is shark and tears up the top card...but the way around that is just keep the top card there.,52608,3
52609,Fabric is nice but only for size 6-8.,52609,3
52610,Nice cuff but was too small so I gave it to my daughter.,52610,3
52610,Made for a smaller wrist.,52610,3
52611,Printed design started to flake off after the first washing.,52611,3
52611,I washed and dried it as directed and the design started coming off after the first wash.,52611,3
52613,The fit of the dress is nice HOWEVER it was very sheer and I need a slip to wear under it.,52613,3
52614,"The swimsuit quality is good, however the top is a little loose, while the bottom is a little too snug to fit.",52614,3
52615,I bought a 1x but it fits like a large,52615,3
52616,These shoes were over the top as far as decorations but thats perfect for a little girl right?,52616,3
52616,The little one wears them so much that after two months one of the bunnies fell off and the toes are a fading from pink to gray.,52616,3
52616,The value matched the price.,52616,3
52617,I like the shirt but it was way too small.,52617,3
52617,had to send it back.,52617,3
52618,Just what I expected!,52618,3
52619,Little smaller than i expected but cute and useable still,52619,3
52620,The picture looks like its fitted but it is not.,52620,3
52620,It has alot of room.,52620,3
52620,I am going to sew some darts to make it fit better.,52620,3
52620,The material and pattern are very nice.,52620,3
52620,It is shear but strong so it still needs something like a tank top underneath.,52620,3
52621,This suit is soooo cute!,52621,3
52621,but is not made for big boobs.,52621,3
52621,"Im a 36DDD more of a medium bottom, large top.",52621,3
52621,I couldn't even zip the top (had breast implants).,52621,3
52621,The butt is skimpy.,52621,3
52621,Would be great for a smaller bust person who doesn't mind being cheeky :-),52621,3
52622,The sizes are apparently Chinese sizes,52622,3
52623,Very cute but very sheer.,52623,3
52624,"the material it's thinner and softer than I expected, and the sleeves are not as large as I thought.",52624,3
52624,color is as shown.,52624,3
52624,"however, it didn';t look as good on me.",52624,3
52625,very very VERY THIN MATERIAL!,52625,3
52627,"The shape, the color looks exactly like a picture so thats a plus.",52627,3
52627,But the material is not at all chiffon not even close to chiffon.,52627,3
52627,Material feels like a umbrella cover or raincoat.,52627,3
52627,It is very transparent so u need to wear a inner underneath.,52627,3
52627,"Overall ok for a day at the beach, fun peppy color.",52627,3
52627,I bought a medium and I wear S/M and it fits perfectly,52627,3
52628,I didn't get the same color.,52628,3
52628,Got the orange logo instead of the yellow.,52628,3
52629,Designed for someone smaller than 5 feet,52629,3
52630,it's cute but too short,52630,3
52631,But I had to return the first one and get a bigger size than I normally wear.,52631,3
52631,I had to pay my own shipping to send it back.,52631,3
52631,Then wait for them to get it to get my money back and still pay for the new one too.,52631,3
52631,"No 2 day shipping from bare necessities, bummer for me I wanted it for my trip to Cancun and that did not happen.",52631,3
52631,Oh well it is really cute and it's comfortable.,52631,3
52634,"I was looking for a ""family-friendly"" bathing suit that still had a bit of pizazz to it--this is more difficult than you may think lol.",52634,3
52634,"Ordered this thinking worse case scenario it didn't cost much if I hate it, so my expectations were pretty low.",52634,3
52634,"However, I was pleasantly surprised by how cute and well made this bathing suit is (the black floral).",52634,3
52634,"However, I have to deduct a couple of stars because the white bathing suit with cherries that I ordered already had the underwire poking out on the right side prior to my first use.",52634,3
52635,Really wanted this to be perfect.,52635,3
52635,"While I have no complaints about the material because I only planned to wear it underneath clothing, the color was off.",52635,3
52635,"I wasn't red, but more of an orange red; nothing like the color in the picture",52635,3
52636,The fit was a little small but it still looks good,52636,3
52637,"The dress was cute but somewhat big on me, and I am a normal size large.",52637,3
52637,"After wearing it at my shower for an hour, my friend pointed out a hole under my arm where it seems like the dress is coming unthreaded.",52637,3
52637,"I can see it back myself, but the stitching quality on both sides of the dress is not very strong.",52637,3
52637,Be prepared to make possible alterations with this dress.,52637,3
52638,These cotton boxer briefs are somewhat long and uncomfortable,52638,3
52639,"The red, white, and blue strap is great!",52639,3
52639,The fake leather one is terrible.,52639,3
52640,I love the look of the purse but don't like the dead fish smell it has.,52640,3
52640,Don't know what it is actually made of but the smell is overpowering.,52640,3
52640,Should know better than to order something made in China.,52640,3
52641,Somewhat large around the back and small on the.,52641,3
52641,Love the pattern and material,52641,3
52643,i would order size up,52643,3
52644,"Seemed ok but I didn't like it, so returned.",52644,3
52646,The top was a bit small for a large bust and arm holes were too small and didn't seem to coordinate with the size.,52646,3
52646,Dress is pretty and seemed a good price.,52646,3
52646,Alterations including length were $90,52646,3
52647,Not as cute as picture,52647,3
52648,A little bit tight fit,52648,3
52649,It's very pretty fabric is nice and airy however they weren't kidding when they said it runs small I'm a 16 i ordered 3x thank God and it's snug if your a bigger lady order two sizes up,52649,3
52650,I purchased 2 kimonos from this manufacturer.,52650,3
52650,"Although I'm 5'2"" and 110 lbs, I ordered them in a large so they would be loose and flowy.",52650,3
52650,"This one fit fine, but the other one is so tiny that I can barely get it on.",52650,3
52650,There is no way it's a large.,52650,3
52651,This is not a sweater it is a SWEAT SHIRT.,52651,3
52651,"Otherwise, it is ok.",52651,3
52653,MUCH bigger than size 10 and what we anticipated.,52653,3
52653,"By the time we realized it, it was too late to ship it back and had to pay $$ for alteration.",52653,3
52653,It's a cute dress but the sizes are not accurate.,52653,3
52654,Unfortunately I had to return this item.,52654,3
52654,I generally buy medium bottoms but I'm a small or extra small on all of my tops & there was no option to select different top or bottom sizes.,52654,3
52656,"Way too small for me, but I also have really thick hair even under my wig cap.",52656,3
52656,"I still wish it were bigger though, because I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem.",52656,3
52656,But it looked really good aside from that.,52656,3
52657,"It is not true to size, order a size larger, nice materia
The shipping from this company is VERY fast!",52657,3
52657,I think I ordered it one night after work and had it the very next day.,52657,3
52657,All I can say about that is WOW,52657,3
52658,I like this shirt but it fits very small.,52658,3
52658,I'm not a big person and purchased and extra large based on sizing.,52658,3
52658,"I'm a 36C and weight 143 and 5'5"".",52658,3
52658,Other than fitting snug I like it but would like to to be a little less fitting.,52658,3
52659,I like the style but I don't like the fabric.,52659,3
52659,It's like a shiny spandex.,52659,3
52659,"For the price, I'll keep it but I'm not super excited",52659,3
52660,Pretty and sparkly but a bit big....it's too much for everyday wear but would be nice for a special occasion.,52660,3
52661,I ordered the XXXL to fit my size 14 body but I had to open up all the seams and insert extra fabric on each side in order to pull on this garment.,52661,3
52661,"Luckily, I'm an experienced seamstress, but for anyone who is not so skilled, this top is going to be much too small to look flowy like in the photo.",52661,3
52662,They were much smaller than expected and they are cloudy.,52662,3
52662,You get what you pay for...,52662,3
52663,Other than the close fit and the cheap material the style/ design is very nice.,52663,3
52664,The hat is very nice.,52664,3
52664,"However, I received mine and there was straw torn on the top, which left a hole!",52664,3
52665,Fits way smaller than it should and wasn't the best made blouse,52665,3
52666,The top was a good fit but the bottom was really small and unflattering on me lol so if have a big butt and thighs I'd recommend maybe ordering a size bigger,52666,3
52667,"Its really nice, just a bit short for my liking",52667,3
52668,the kid liked them but they are cheaply made.,52668,3
52668,One came already kind of messed up so we only got a couple of wears out of it before it stripped out.,52668,3
52669,"Cute dress, fits small through the torso",52669,3
52670,"I had asked prior to ordering, how well they felt vinyl would go on these jerseys.",52670,3
52670,"I did not receive a response but really wanted the jerseys for my sons homecoming game, so I ordered them anyway.",52670,3
52670,They not do very well with vinyl.,52670,3
52670,It applied fine but didn't stay on after the first wash. We will reorder new ones but will look for ones that specify how they do with vinyl.,52670,3
52670,My XL fit a bit big but my husbands 2XL was a bit small.,52670,3
52670,They were fine for a one time use.,52670,3
52671,"I wore it once in Florida this summer, but it's not very comfortable.",52671,3
52671,The bottoms are also not that flattering on the back.,52671,3
52671,I have a pretty large butt and they didn't really flatter that.,52671,3
52672,Extremely scratchy which I expected but it's also pretty hard to move my arms up and down in it.,52672,3
52673,The shoes are beautiful.,52673,3
52673,I love the mesh but are uncomfortable being that the weight of the foot pushes down towards the top of the shoe causing blisters..,52673,3
52673,I've worn them a few times already and still not used to them.,52673,3
52673,If you buy them make sure you find out a way to give them extra support,52673,3
52674,"The product was ok, but what should have fit, did not, gave to my daughter.",52674,3
52674,They were on the smaller side.,52674,3
52675,"It's ok for the price but, it's about 1/2 inch bigger than expected and the support is more near the bottom and not the rib parts.",52675,3
52675,Currently seeking a different option.,52675,3
52676,"I thought this was actually going to be knit, it's fleece with a knit pattern printed on it.",52676,3
52676,"I still wear it, it's soft but is pretty thin.",52676,3
52677,Not bad for price but can see the difference in quality.,52677,3
52678,Nice but runs small,52678,3
52679,It was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be.,52679,3
52680,"I'm 5'7"", so it was very short on me.",52680,3
52680,I ended up giving it to my niece and it fit her better.,52680,3
52681,"It's a pretty dress, flattering, comfortable, fits well in the chest and arms.",52681,3
52681,"The material is a little bit like a nightgown, but with the right jewelry and hair styled, it will dress it up.",52681,3
52681,"It is about 8 inches too long and I'm 5'5"".",52681,3
52681,"It will work for the occasion I bought it for, but not my favorite piece of clothing.",52681,3
52681,My daughter said it was gorgeous.,52681,3
52682,"comes with a lot of parts, just very small around the chest area.",52682,3
52682,zipper broke after a couple wears.,52682,3
52683,The tiara is beautiful but it does not fit me.,52683,3
52683,Perhaps my hair is too thin or too short or my head is too small.,52683,3
52683,"Once I got the comb to stay in my hair by lots of teasing, the ends of the tiara stuck straight out.",52683,3
52683,I know Bobbi pins are to be used in the ends of the tiara but there was no way to get them in my hair and I was afraid to bend the tiara.,52683,3
52684,"The photo shows a lily white dress, but mine was off white and also dirty from the black print.",52684,3
52684,Seems asthough they folded the dress before the ink could dry completly.,52684,3
52685,"Sexy, my husband loved it, too hoochie for me so it is going to be my Halloween costume.",52685,3
52685,Tight fitting cute though.,52685,3
52686,Good for mild winters.,52686,3
52687,"Soft and comfortable, but far too small.",52687,3
52687,I have the average head size (21 inches for females).,52687,3
52687,This hat is too small.,52687,3
52687,"It does slouch a little in the back, but if your hair is longer than your chin--it will be far too small.",52687,3
52687,"It does look similar to the picture, but it is too tight.",52687,3
52687,"The reason I like slouchy beanies is because they are generally loose, comfortable, and you can hide your hair away in them...",52687,3
52687,"I bought two of these hats in different colors, and that won't be an option when my hair grows back out.",52687,3
52687,MATERIAL: It feels like a silky t-shirt.,52687,3
52687,QUALITY: Stitching is good and fabric is doubled.,52687,3
52687,SHIPPING: Shipped from China to Ohio in 13 days.,52687,3
52688,"Very pretty, but came with some of the beads already hanging off.",52688,3
52689,"Doesn't seem to screw on well, acts as though it gets stuck part way on.",52689,3
52690,Was to short for my husband to use.,52690,3
52690,The snaps kept coming off his shirt as soon as he started walking.,52690,3
52690,Sadly there was no snap on the bottom peace to clip to socks.,52690,3
52690,As it was in the instructions.,52690,3
52691,What I received is nothing like the photo.,52691,3
52691,Made of very thin sweatshirt material and tiny pockets are for show!,52691,3
52692,It was not a standard size I ordered.,52692,3
52692,It was cut toooooooooo small.,52692,3
52692,"Would love to return it, if not more money wasted",52692,3
52693,The stitching isn't the best quality-,52693,3
52694,Could be a little smaller but i have this problem with lots of clothing.,52694,3
52694,The top part sticks out too so i might try to mod that into a removable vest.,52694,3
52695,I almost gave this dress 2 stars!,52695,3
52695,It's NOT the color (purple) in the picture!,52695,3
52695,I NEEDED the color purple advertised!,52695,3
52695,It's more of a pink than purple.,52695,3
52695,Nice dress but not what I ordered!,52695,3
52695,"Plus, the bodice is super tight.",52695,3
52695,I read the reviews before ordering and order up and it was still way to tight!,52695,3
52696,"I'm sure these are nice capped mittens, but they're not work gloves, and that's what I needed.",52696,3
52696,These are light-use easy-wear gloves.,52696,3
52697,didn't know what to check bc the shoes are not as i expected.,52697,3
52697,i thought they had zippers in back for easy on and off.,52697,3
52697,i can't do the small buckles on the side of the shoe.,52697,3
52698,"Not what I expected, a little shorter than I thought they would be and not even close to the same color blue so I have to get more jeans in the correct color.",52698,3
52699,cute but it is not as loose fitting as the picture suggests,52699,3
52700,"A little too sheer to wear without flesh colored bras, but so gorgeous.",52700,3
52700,The movement in the layers is perfect.,52700,3
52701,"Honestly, I'm not sure what this is really made of.",52701,3
52701,Wife says it could be serpentine?,52701,3
52701,Dyed something or other?,52701,3
52701,"looked a bit better in the picture, but not bad up close, so she likes it.",52701,3
52701,She likes green in any case.,52701,3
52701,I wanted to give her this because it's a Buddha (an old nickname referring to yours truly) and she thought he looked really happy.,52701,3
52701,"Arrived pretty quickly considering it was shipped from overseas, I think.",52701,3
52701,"Has a cord threaded through the top to wear as a necklace, with a little spacer bead on it that looks plastic, for some reason.",52701,3
52702,"Daughters love it, my only reason i put three starts is that it is way too long.",52702,3
52704,"The fit is alright(just a little small) and they're fairly comfortable, but the bottoms have a habit of rolling up a little on me which is a little annoying.",52704,3
52706,"I ordered a size or two up and it fit perfectly she was so adorable like a little willie wonka character but be careful with care, she spill baby food on the shirt and it won't seem to come out not even with bleach.",52706,3
52706,Not sure whats up with this fabric?,52706,3
52707,The robe is a little big,52707,3
52708,too be size a (small) its kinda big.,52708,3
52710,I purposely bought it small so it would fit tight and it did.,52710,3
52710,"Problem is, it doesn't look like the one in the picture.",52710,3
52710,The picture shows the hexagonal texture but the final is missing that and has some stitch pattern similar to the solid lighter blue one.,52710,3
52710,It also has a zipper running through a stripe.,52710,3
52710,It isn't totally ugly but a little disappointing,52710,3
52711,Bought XXL fits like a large.,52711,3
52711,Nice looking shirt though but couldn't use it.,52711,3
52712,"Is ok for price, would have wanted earrings to go with it.",52712,3
52713,"Look carefully for size, run small.",52713,3
52714,The fit is typical.,52714,3
52714,"The fabric is nothing special (cheap quality), but I like that the top has elastic instead of snaps to facilitate nursing.",52714,3
52715,It does not fit.,52715,3
52715,It's too big and very hard to keep on her wrist.,52715,3
52715,Not meant for a juvenile.,52715,3
52716,This is beautiful but not very useful.,52716,3
52716,It will not hold an iPhone 6 or a pair of glasses.,52716,3
52717,I have this shirt in blue and really love it so I figured I would get the black one too.,52717,3
52717,The material is different and a little stiff and thin.,52717,3
52717,"There was a huge hole in the wrist part of the sleeve the second time I wore it, disappointed in that.",52717,3
52717,Was going to order another one but now I'll look around for something else.,52717,3
52718,"It's a little small and the pads on the inside are so obvious so I just took them out, it is comfy tho and cute too",52718,3
52719,By accident I bought this suit for my  daughter...oops!!,52719,3
52719,"Loved the top, hated the bottom, she has an hour glass figure...with more emphasis on the rear end and chest area, so this bottom doesn't work for her, it's a matter of personal opinion, she doesn't like showing her rear end off.",52719,3
52719,"Its a beautiful suit, and cool how you can wear it either solid color or peacock print, loving that option!!",52719,3
52719,Can't believe people did t make these years ago.,52719,3
52719,"So beautiful suit, just the type of bottoms aren't my daughter's kind to wear, we figure we can find a solid teal bottom and she can still wear the top with it.",52719,3
52719,Great price on this too!,52719,3
52720,"Too small for my rest, it's an ok quality....it's not that bad and it's not that good...",52720,3
52722,"I mainly purchased these socks for the grip bottoms and for that, they are great.",52722,3
52722,"The fit, for me however, seems to bit small or awkward in the toes.",52722,3
52722,They are not awful and some pairs fit better than others.,52722,3
52722,I'm not sure if I just have weird feet or if it's the way the toes are sewn.,52722,3
52722,My 10 year old grandson really likes them though so he has inherited them and really likes them.,52722,3
52724,"The earrings are okay, they're noticeably different colors, one is very blue and the other is very green.",52724,3
52724,"Not bad for the price though, I will still be wearing them.",52724,3
52724,"The necklace has a nice stone, but the plastic around it and the chain are definitely very tacky.",52724,3
52724,I mainly bought this for the earrings so I'm not too bothered about the necklace.,52724,3
52725,"Nice chain, looks real.",52725,3
52725,BUT THE CHAIN WAS NOT 20inches.,52725,3
52725,The chain is like a choker on my neck,52725,3
52726,Didn't love the fit.,52726,3
52727,This is not very dense and you can see more mess than hair.,52727,3
52727,This fits small and does not stretch much.,52727,3
52727,"Disappointing as I expected more, but it is OK.",52727,3
52727,It was not much money so that is not too bad.,52727,3
52728,straight cut shirt only not the same as the pictur....,52728,3
52729,A little bit smaller.,52729,3
52730,I bought these to try to stop my wife's engagement ring from flipping around on her finger.,52730,3
52730,She has thin fingers with larger knuckles.,52730,3
52730,All of these were too big to do the job.,52730,3
52730,"However, I do believe these would work on a ring that was incorrectly sized.",52730,3
52731,The balls totally fall off so easily,52731,3
52732,"The hoops are really classy and beautiful, but the part that actually goes through your ear is a little weird.",52732,3
52732,It's a tall flat shape that gets wider and wider toward the front.,52732,3
52732,"I have pretty hardy ears, no sensitivities to any metals, but with these if I push the posts too far back they really hurt, I have to push the posts forward so the thinnest part is in my earlobes.",52732,3
52733,I bought an extra large for my little sister who is 15 years old.,52733,3
52733,She's rather tall for her age so seeing that most people said it ran small I went two sizes up for her.,52733,3
52733,"When it got here, it was only big enough for my 8 year old sister to wear.",52733,3
52733,It looked like a kid's jacket.,52733,3
52733,"If you plan on getting it, order at least three or more sizes up.",52733,3
52734,too small - I'm a size 10 and it didn't fit  -,52734,3
52735,"Roomy enough to fit multiple textbooks, can probably squeeze in a laptop in addition to the books shown.",52735,3
52735,"Would have loved (love the design) it if didn't come with an awful fishy smell, flaws in craftmenship, and I don't think this is genuane leather.",52735,3
52736,was comfortable that my 3yr old liked wagering them all the time without complaining (as long as they remained dry)but the soles kept coming out when she took them off (if the were wet).,52736,3
52736,we bought them to go to a Waterpark and she had to take them off on the large slides so the soles coming out or bunching up under her feet all the time became problematic,52736,3
52737,"The dress was made well, however it's not like the picture.",52737,3
52737,It has lining all the way down which causes it to be stiff and not flowy like the picture.,52737,3
52737,It's a cute dress and very affordable.,52737,3
52737,"great communication and shipped quickly because i paid for expedited shipping, however, it's not like the picture so i will be returning it.",52737,3
52737,it also fit well except the breast area was way too high.,52737,3
52738,Pants run rather short in length,52738,3
52739,This item fit a bit larger then I was expecting.,52739,3
52739,"Although I am pregnant and growing, it was still bigger then it should have been for a size small.",52739,3
52740,Necklace pendant is nice but the leather chain feel apart.,52740,3
52740,You can away use the butterfly on other chains.,52740,3
52741,Haven't even worn it halfway through winter.,52741,3
52741,It's not great without a scarf.,52741,3
52741,Belt is annoying to put on and jacket only closes with a snap.,52741,3
52741,Plus I have huge monkey arms that I always seem to have to buy men's coats to cover them to my wrists.,52741,3
52742,The shoe runs small,52742,3
52743,Fits small and not as long as the pic very short but still cute,52743,3
52744,Im normally a medium but after hearing it runs small I got a large and it fit well.,52744,3
52744,"The material is nice and comfortable, somewhat stretchy.",52744,3
52744,"However the sleeves and bow aren't black as pictured, but the same color as the rest of the dress!",52744,3
52745,This is a nice shirt but one size fits all may not be a good description.,52745,3
52745,"It's very long in the back, like touches the back of my knees and I am 5'3"" and the width is quite wide.",52745,3
52745,"It's a cute top, just being able to choose from xs-xl would probably be better to get the right fit.",52745,3
52746,The screen print is blurry.,52746,3
52747,Too small for a M,52747,3
52748,material is pretty thin and breathable.,52748,3
52748,"if you are looking for tight pants that holds, this is not for you.",52748,3
52749,Too large on top.,52749,3
52749,Even if you have a larger chest there is no elastic.,52749,3
52749,Did not want to use the clear plastic straps as it would look tacky.,52749,3
52750,"Nice but kinda to short in the torso and not enough support in the chest area,i gave it to my daughter she loves it it fits her fine.",52750,3
52751,"It is a bit short, but will still look good with my skirt",52751,3
52752,This shoe is as comfortable as others that I purchased that were similar.,52752,3
52753,I bought a customized size dress.,52753,3
52753,"It was absolutely gorgeous, fit perfect, but a little disappointed I found two stains on the dress I can not get out.",52753,3
52754,"Fit was a little small, and the sleeves were pretty short.",52754,3
52755,"Had minor difficulty figuring it out, no manual/instructions.",52755,3
52755,Last I had worked differently.,52755,3
52755,"Otherwise OK, still worth considering high shipping cost.",52755,3
52756,My pants size is 8 ...9...11 depends on brands..after i read reviews  from some customers i order 13 it's a bit large ( loose)..the color and materials is speechless.,52756,3
52757,"A 2X fit like a long tunic dress, not like a T-shirt.",52757,3
52757,"In Gildan, a 2X fits perfectly on me but in Liquid Blue that would be a 1X.",52757,3
52758,Smaller than I thought,52758,3
52759,"Feel great, sturdy construction, hand wash is recommended, these don't go up as high on the leg as depicted so you will only be able to wear these with full length pants or high booties/boots.",52759,3
52759,"I have very thin ankles and lower leg, so these really do not fit as depicted but I  will keep them mostly to wear this winter with leggings and high boots.",52759,3
52760,Not sure why they only make even sizes...?,52760,3
52761,The bracelet is beautiful but it is so difficult to get it on/off because of the clasp.,52761,3
52761,I almost returned it but it is so pretty and sparkly.,52761,3
52761,"Sadly, I've only been able to wear it 2 times though.",52761,3
52762,I was really excited about this product.,52762,3
52762,If you weigh 100 lbs it will fit you just like it does the model.,52762,3
52763,Material and workmanship is good.,52763,3
52763,Size is tricky to figure out.,52763,3
52763,"Cups and underwires made for very small bust even though bust measures 42, cups fit A or B, not a D-DD like you'd expect.",52763,3
52764,It's o for the price,52764,3
52765,"Slightly more transparent in certain lighting than I had hoped, but bathing suit or proper undergarment makes it acceptable.",52765,3
52765,"Very comfortable, that's why I ordered a second one!",52765,3
52765,A perfect at home dress.,52765,3
52765,"If I could improve it, the stripes would be vertical rather than horizontal.",52765,3
52765,"No one looks their best in horizontal stripes and no matter how off the shoulder you where it, the horizontal effect is still there!",52765,3
52765,Arrived sooner than expected.,52765,3
52766,"Not sweater material, more like thin cardigan material.",52766,3
52767,not so comfortable to wear all day.,52767,3
52767,so not good for all day at the theme park.,52767,3
52767,but good for night time at camping.,52767,3
52767,the lights are fun.,52767,3
52769,It is beautiful but the mounting point to hang the moon from the chain is a little off the balance point to make it even with the little tree piece.,52769,3
52770,"I wish the color was lighter like the picture portrays, Ruffles in the shoulders are too much",52770,3
52771,I love the look and concept of these!,52771,3
52771,They seem to run big.,52771,3
52771,My 12 month old is in a size 3 shoe and these definitely were big on her.,52771,3
52771,She couldn't slip them off like she does with her socks though so I'm impressed!,52771,3
52771,I'm disappointed that one of them came with what looks like mold or staining on it though.,52771,3
52771,"I'm hoping it'll wash out, but I'm disappointed that it was sent out looking like it did.",52771,3
52772,"When I tried it on it kind of looked like a pajama set considering the fact a ""small "" wasn't small enough for me , the top fit fine but the bottoms were a bit saggy",52772,3
52773,Vibrant colors and excellent material even on a hot day.,52773,3
52773,"I got many complements at a Jimmy Buffett concert, so y  Only problem is size is way too small.",52773,3
52773,I normally wear 3X so I ordered a 4X to make sure it was on the larger side rather than the smaller side.,52773,3
52773,Unfortunately it fits like a 2X.,52773,3
52773,I think I'd have to order a 6X to get a 3X equivalent with some room to spare.,52773,3
52774,Doesn't even seem close to being an extra small.,52774,3
52774,More like a medium and not fitted at all.,52774,3
52774,I have to use a hair tie to hold it back so that it doesn't just look like a giant bag hanging off of me.,52774,3
52774,"Since I have to tie it behind me, no one can read it.",52774,3
52775,"The silk is soft and very nice fit, but it's silk.",52775,3
52775,"Yes, silk is nice...but it just falls off my head several times each night, so....not a great deal if won't stay on your head.",52775,3
52776,"Decent quality, but after a few weeks I started to notice it degrading a little, glue is peeling from the sides, but other than that it feels and looks professional.",52776,3
52777,"Fits right but cheap, thin material.",52777,3
52778,Had to fix the crotch twice now for holes developing...,52778,3
52779,Beautifully made however the fabric too cheap and it is cotton so you would have to iron it,52779,3
52780,Very cute suit but sizing off!,52780,3
52780,"Ordered biggest size in this color,  which I did in the other colors too.",52780,3
52780,This didn't fit but the others fit perfect.,52780,3
52781,"God Product, good price",52781,3
52782,Although belt was in the size I needed it was not the correct measurement.,52782,3
52782,Order was not as needed.,52782,3
52783,Great size and perfect as crossbody or underarm bag.,52783,3
52783,Will be a nice travel bag.,52783,3
52783,Only giving 3 stars as material is a bit stiff and a little loud when digging inside.,52783,3
52783,Also zippers are a bit sticky.,52783,3
52783,Probably just needs to be worked and broken in more.,52783,3
52784,These are smaller than I expected.,52784,3
52784,They barely fit my petite 2.5 year old daughter.,52784,3
52784,"They are probably the right size for about an 18 month old, but that age would have a difficult time getting their fingers into the gloves.",52784,3
52784,"They are definitely soft and warm, though.",52784,3
52785,I wear a true size 8 shoe but these are closer to a size 7 or 7 1/2.,52785,3
52785,I put them next to my size 8 Crocs and they are at least a half inch shorter.,52785,3
52785,In spite of this I can still wear them--I really like the footbed which feels almost like walking barefoot only with arch support.,52785,3
52785,After break in they should be wearable all day.,52785,3
52785,"Also, only one of the two pairs is one piece construction.",52785,3
52785,The other one must be an older version as it has the cut out toe post instead.,52785,3
52785,I would have given them four stars except for the sizing issue.,52785,3
52786,I loved the color and the style of the dress was what I expected.,52786,3
52786,The zipper to the dress is horrible!!!,52786,3
52786,"It doesn't let you zip it up all the way, it only zips up half way.",52786,3
52786,BUST is too BiG!!!,52786,3
52786,I can't imagine anyone wearing a Size small having a Bust that big!!!,52786,3
52786,"The dress fits well but, being only 5ft., the dress is much too long!!!",52786,3
52786,Beautiful dress & I love the way its put together but I am very disappointing in how big & long this dress was,52786,3
52788,Fine for around the house,52788,3
52789,No elasticity in the sleves.,52789,3
52789,"I have big arms, and the lace feels like its suffocating my arms.",52789,3
52789,But the shirt fits my body.,52789,3
52790,It's cute but too small,52790,3
52791,These are okay but they do not last all that long.,52791,3
52792,"It didn't work well for me, as it was a bit flimsy, otherwise I like the design and color and the fit was great for a 5'7"" and 125 lbs woman.",52792,3
52793,This was made for a giant.,52793,3
52793,I needed something a little wider but not 8ft long.,52793,3
52793,I'm 5'6 250lbs and should of gotten 1-2 sizes smaller (ordered XXL).,52793,3
52793,Haven't been able to wear the booties because I have to roll the legs up just to get around.,52793,3
52794,They can not breath,52794,3
52795,Soft comfy but run big.,52795,3
52795,No belt loops either,52795,3
52796,The picture and description make it seem like it is long and fits great.,52796,3
52796,But I have to agree with the reviews.,52796,3
52796,It's on the small side.,52796,3
52796,I got an XL because of reading the reviews and it fit my 12 yr old daughter.,52796,3
52796,"And it's very thin, so more like a long sleeve shirt.",52796,3
52796,At least my daughter will have something to add to her wardrobe.,52796,3
52798,"I ordered a size Large (which according to the listing is a size 4 in the US), and it definitely fit way large.",52798,3
52798,"It was still wearable, but I expected it to be slightly more tight-fit, especially around the waist and butt area.",52798,3
52798,"Not like a bodycon, but still snug.",52798,3
52798,"Also, I did not like that the material of the dress was so thin.",52798,3
52798,It felt very cheap.,52798,3
52798,"However, if you plan to wear this on a date or something, that's fine.",52798,3
52798,I don't expect to get many wears out of it though.,52798,3
52799,Just a bit to short,52799,3
52800,Defiantly for a guy with smaller thighs and small butt.,52800,3
52800,Not very good access to rear.,52800,3
52800,Doesn't really keep package in place either.,52800,3
52801,Top fits weird and gaps open.,52801,3
52801,I guess it's the price you pay for not being able to try it on first.,52801,3
52801,Pretty good material that will probably last if it fit me right!,52801,3
52802,Firstly I don't wear hats.,52802,3
52802,Only bought a hat to ride on trail ride into Houston and around downtown.,52802,3
52802,It served that purpose fine.,52802,3
52802,"Evidently the style now is a ""bull rider's"" crease but this hat has a ""Roy Roger's"" crease so I took a lot of guff from the ""real"" cowboys.",52802,3
52802,I still love Roy Rogers.,52802,3
52803,"I like the bracelet, but the inscription is so small it makes it difficult to read.....",52803,3
52804,Fabric was not what I expected.,52804,3
52804,"Love the prints, just wish they were made of a stronger fabric that doesn't stretch out and move around when I work out.",52804,3
52805,Unfortunately the chain was broken when it arrived......Cost too much to send it back.,52805,3
52806,"It looks not quite like on picture - it's wider and it doesn't have highlighted areas, the size is alright, but I have the narrow hips, for someone with wider hips it would be impossible to wear.",52806,3
52806,"One more thing I don't like that it's very stiff, I've tried epsom salt and vinegar to soften it, it's still too stiff.",52806,3
52807,Keeps sliding down my bum.,52807,3
52808,The waistband was a big thick elastic waistband rather than the plain stretchy scuba fabric of the same size/style Navy skirt.,52808,3
52808,"Also, the color was more of a light Camel .",52808,3
52808,( I understand that there was a disclaimer about the color.),52808,3
52809,Nothing like the pics...not satisfied at all and will give to female elementary students.,52809,3
52810,"I was really excited about this product to come in and once it was here, it does not look as great as on the photos(not necessarily a bad thing, but its just my personal feeling).",52810,3
52810,"As always, the wallet can only be as slim as the stuff you put inside it, right?",52810,3
52810,"I personally have an ID, 3-4 bills and 4 cards(I do not carry all the cards that I have on me).",52810,3
52810,"So, at this point its is fairly slim(again, ""slim"" is subjective).",52810,3
52811,I bought this for my boyfriend who is typically a medium.,52811,3
52811,"The sleeves were very tight, it fit more like a woman's cut shirt.",52811,3
52812,Super sheer and comfy,52812,3
52814,"The top is completely see through, however its a cute dress.",52814,3
52814,I would recommend going up in  size.,52814,3
52814,I am 5'2 145 and ordered a large,52814,3
52815,The skirt itself would be fantastic if the waist was big enough to match the rest of the measurements,52815,3
52816,Cute but not as impressive as the picture.,52816,3
52816,It's a lot smaller in person and the stone is less brilliant and visible in person.,52816,3
52816,I'd return it do wasn't overseas,52816,3
52817,I sincerely got so tired of the Asian sizes.,52817,3
52817,"The material has good quality, but is not so stretchy.",52817,3
52817,"I bought it in my size, but is too small.",52817,3
52818,Loved the shoes but one piece to strap them on was missing overall I would give it a 3 star.,52818,3
52819,This dress is very pretty-the purple color is lovely but it definitely runs on the smaller side.,52819,3
52819,I generally wear a size 14 so I ordered an XL but it was so snug and showed off everything.,52819,3
52819,"Also, while the lace overlay is nice, my husband pointed out that it was cut incorrectly in the back so that it hangs noticeably lower in some areas.",52819,3
52819,The bodice is also a little crooked.,52819,3
52819,"Overall, the price is great but still not enough to keep it.",52819,3
52820,too big and not easy to wear.,52820,3
52821,I over estimated the size and need a larger one,52821,3
52823,quality of graphics not as good as i'd have liked,52823,3
52824,The diamond logo doesn't look perfect like the image and it's too small needs to be bigger.,52824,3
52825,So I'm a medium by American standards and after reading the reviews I ordered the XL.,52825,3
52825,I barely squeeze into it and you can fully see everything underneath like belly button.,52825,3
52825,It did come much earlier than expected they told me June 1-17th and its May 12.,52825,3
52826,ok but a little large,52826,3
52827,"Pretty, but heavy and hurts ears",52827,3
52828,"arrived earlier than expected but even though I read through a good number of reviews to find out which size was best to buy, ended up buying a size too big.",52828,3
52828,"it's ok, the size, but it fits comfortably at the third hook so it doesn't leave any room for results.",52828,3
52828,"I am going to exchange for a smaller size,",52828,3
52829,The thin border was frayed when it was delivered to me.,52829,3
52829,Looks like it happened during the process of making it.,52829,3
52830,"I love the color of this top, but it fit just a bit too tight for my taste and was MUCH shorter than I thought it would be.",52830,3
52830,"This was, by no means, a dress.",52830,3
52830,"I have a little longer torso, so from the image and measurements, I expected this to hit just past my hips, maybe a little over my butt, however it barely goes to my lower stomach.",52830,3
52830,Maybe it's that way because I'm a little bustier.,52830,3
52830,"When I got it, there was also a tag on what I thought was the back collar seam, but then that put a long seam line right down the front of the dress, which I didn't like.",52830,3
52830,So I cut the tag off and wore it with the seam in the back.,52830,3
52830,"When I did wear it for an extended period of time at work though, it kept riding up and I had to keep tugging it back down to keep my midriff from showing.",52830,3
52830,"I prefer longer shirts, much like tunics, so I probably won't wear this much.",52830,3
52830,"It's well made and very pretty, but not the fit I was hoping for.",52830,3
52831,Beautiful with a collared white shirt and my jeans....nice look.,52831,3
52831,Get it and enjoy it!,52831,3
52832,"It's a quality hat, but the brim is so big and floppy that he can't see anything when he wears it.",52832,3
52832,I've considered putting some Stiffen Stuff on it to see if it will help.,52832,3
52832,But he won't wear it since it's always covering his little eyes.,52832,3
52833,Should be more like $5 since it's one of those you can get at Ross.,52833,3
52833,The fabric is really thin and once you wash it there will be little balls all over it.,52833,3
52833,Size 4 is like a medium- large.,52833,3
52833,I give it 3 stars for good customer service,52833,3
52834,Great shoe size 5 fit on left foot but they sent a size 7 for the right foot.,52834,3
52834,Waiting for them to be accepted back.,52834,3
52835,"Great looking shoes but for some reason where the tongue connects to the shoe creates a crease that kinda rubs the wrong way, might just have to break them in.",52835,3
52836,Wish it was tighter in the lower and area,52836,3
52837,"This thing was super small, but also not.",52837,3
52837,"After a Mammogram-like squeeze into this ""XXL dress"", the bust was too big!",52837,3
52837,"As one with a larger chest, that has never happened to me before.",52837,3
52837,"Also, be sure to buy some shorts or bloomers so that you can go out in public in your Halloween costume.",52837,3
52837,"Unless you love showing off your bootie to the entire world, in which case, don't listen to me.",52837,3
52838,Reordered a larger size but fits tight across bust,52838,3
52839,I like this outfit its really plain but you can jazz it up real nice.,52839,3
52839,"I ordered a large, would have ordered an XL if I could have but it only goes up to a L. The skirt fit perfectly fine but the top was WAAAAAY too small.",52839,3
52839,I am busty so the shirt fits like a bra.,52839,3
52839,"My only con, the damn s*** >_<",52839,3
52840,Not the best fabric however the visual effect is quite nice.,52840,3
52841,"It looked nice, but after a few weeks it fell apart.",52841,3
52842,Order 1 size bigger than what you normally wear!!,52842,3
52842,Sending mine back :( love the details on it though...would be worth it if it fit.,52842,3
52843,"That shirt is not an ""Amercan size"" XL.",52843,3
52843,Need to lose weight anyway.,52843,3
52845,"It fit really snug, and was bought at his normal size shirt.",52845,3
52845,"Other than that, great shirt.",52845,3
52846,Nice comfy jogging pants.,52846,3
52846,Just missing pockets although I knew that when I bought them I still wish I'd gone with pockets.,52846,3
52847,wish it was more form fitting,52847,3
52848,"One of them won't clip in but, so I can't wear them but they are beautiful.",52848,3
52848,"The one that does clip in, stays on fine not problems whatsoever coming off.",52848,3
52849,These gloves are as cute as they look in the picture.,52849,3
52849,They're much more wool than any cashmere.,52849,3
52849,Kind of itchy which wool obviously is.,52849,3
52849,"If you don't mind having wool gloves, they really are very attractive and warmer than the typical fashion glove.",52849,3
52849,I'd personally give them 5 stars but gave 3 because they were supposed to be mostly cashmere and I feel that the product description was misleading to the public.,52849,3
52850,"they're okay, not the best quality but I love that they fit my 3month old daughter well!",52850,3
52851,"if you think your are getting silver, think again.",52851,3
52851,i give it 3 stars because the stone is super pretty.,52851,3
52851,"if you are buying this ring solely because you want to look at the pretty stone, then it's more than worth the price you pay.",52851,3
52851,"i'm not sorry i bought it, i'm a little sad i can't wear it all the time.",52851,3
52852,the shirt is not gray its more like a brownish color.,52852,3
52853,The quality of the dress,52853,3
52854,"It fit when I got it, then I washed it one time and now I have a muscle shirt.",52854,3
52855,"I got a XXL, i am 5""7 and have 39"" Bust.",52855,3
52855,"The fit is much much boxier than expected, but sleeves, length, and bust all fit great.",52855,3
52855,"Luckily, I know how to sew, so i'll be taking it in a bit to give it a nicer shape.",52855,3
52855,"For the price, it's pretty good.",52855,3
52856,"item is okay, it came in one piece but the gem looks like it has been glued back.",52856,3
52856,"If you don't have a budget for the noble collection, this one is a good alternative.",52856,3
52856,"For everyone's information, The Noble Collection one has a well sculpted eagle, this one has a not-so-well sculpted chick.",52856,3
52857,"The badge look good but the box/case for them is just a cardboard box, would be better if it was a hard cover of sorts",52857,3
52858,"Cheap, too tight if you're busty but cute for a teen",52858,3
52861,Bought for my mom who is very petite.,52861,3
52861,This is a men's size small and they don't carry women's small sweatshirt.,52861,3
52862,"The color was a little different from what it appeared, I thought I was ordering more of a light lavender, but it appeared to be more of a pink color.",52862,3
52862,Not exactly what I was looking for.,52862,3
52863,Nicely made but size is small,52863,3
52864,"Had a tough time getting this over my shoulders, although it fit everywhere else once it was on.",52864,3
52864,"It was a nightmare to get back off though, so I didn't want to keep it.",52864,3
52865,"Cute shirt, too small though, not the best quality has a few loose stings I had to cut",52865,3
52866,Fits nicely but not te best quality.,52866,3
52866,Ripped after a month of wearing on a seam.,52866,3
52867,I buy these bras for a couple years of always had no problem but somehow these ones came to small same bra,52867,3
52868,I was too small 4 me .,52868,3
52869,This product runs super small - I'm 5'5 and 125 lbs and a medium isn't large enough for me.. Other than that I really liked them so will be exchanging them for a larger size.,52869,3
52871,these run pretty small.,52871,3
52872,"Nice blouse, too small gave it to my mother she love  it.",52872,3
52873,Unless you got a full bottom and don't mind the suit sitting high on your check then you might love it my body is petite and the fringe made me look funny low in the front high in the back.,52873,3
52873,Idk it was just weird on me,52873,3
52874,A little bit itchy here and there.,52874,3
52874,I appreciated those straps thats pulls my buns.,52874,3
52874,"The quality is good but the size isn't, I m Asian as well and I picked the large size and it couldn't fit perfectly.",52874,3
52874,Overall it's a good to try on.,52874,3
52875,Bought this dress a little bigger as the reviews sounded like it comes small.,52875,3
52875,"The dress itself fit with a larger size, except for on top.",52875,3
52875,The top panels don't come down far enough and end well before the bra line.,52875,3
52876,"Very short in the bodice/shoulder area, but then too wide in the waist.",52876,3
52876,"The neckline rides too high, but the dress is loose.",52876,3
52876,I do have large shoulders and a smaller waist.,52876,3
52876,"I think I bought a size 6, which is my size.",52876,3
52876,If you have small shoulders and are busty this may work for you.,52876,3
52876,"It's decent for the price, but certainly not a quality piece.",52876,3
52877,"This is a fabulous cape, well made, looking quite chic but it is way too small for my size 14 frame.",52877,3
52877,I will have to gift it to someone.,52877,3
52878,I wear a size 13 and they fit a bit smaller than I'd like; more so in length than width.,52878,3
52879,"Smaller than indicated, but love the style.",52879,3
52880,does not look like the picture.,52880,3
52880,"in addition, one radical was missing.",52880,3
52882,They are above knee and roll down the compression is good,52882,3
52883,"Top fit ok, bottoms were a little small.",52883,3
52884,Runs smaller than indigo ones I have purchased.,52884,3
52885,This top is cuter than I expected.,52885,3
52885,When I took it out of the package it looked baggy and unappealing.,52885,3
52885,But I tried it on and it fit well and looks pretty cute on.,52885,3
52885,"I normally wear a 20-22, and I got the largest size (I think 3x), and that fits me.",52885,3
52885,"There are some flaws in the shirt:  the hem is not even in the front, the material is very thin, and it's definitely see through, even though I bought a dark color to try to avoid that.",52885,3
52885,"But the unevenness is within acceptable limits for my taste, and I'm willing to wear a cami under it, so it works out.",52885,3
52885,"It's a cute, casual shirt, that I don't expect to last long, because I doubt the material will hold up to very many washings.",52885,3
52886,By son had fun but the it's a very cheap plastic,52886,3
52887,"It's ok, looks like the letters will fade fast too bad it wasn't sown on",52887,3
52888,"Liked the product ,but the sizes come to small.",52888,3
52889,Cute but after you washed them the flower looses its shape.,52889,3
52891,"Really cute top, but it is a crop top not a full singlet.",52891,3
52891,Also the neck line is a little higher than how it looks in the picure.,52891,3
52893,Very pretty sparkles a lot but I do not think can pass as real but it's very pretty just need to put on better chain one moor attractive.,52893,3
52893,For the money cant complain.,52893,3
52894,I love the look of these.. but the sequins are not comfortable and there is no layer between you and the sequins.,52894,3
52894,they snag on everything and pinch.,52894,3
52895,"Not the best quality, but for the price, I can't really complain.",52895,3
52895,I would say it's worth what you pay for it.,52895,3
52896,Nice shirt but it wrinkled so easily and also size chart doesn't match.,52896,3
52897,"Nice shirt jacket,  however I had just as nice shirt jackets, same weight or heavier for less.",52897,3
52898,the charge wears out 2 fast.,52898,3
52898,It is complicating to program.,52898,3
52899,The bag itself is very pretty.,52899,3
52899,Nice lines and I love the pockets.,52899,3
52899,"I have a note 5 and it fits in the back pocket, tight, but it fits.",52899,3
52899,"The only reason I gave it 3 stars, is it ordered a coral handbag.",52899,3
52899,When the bag arrived it is more of an orange.,52899,3
52899,The color on the receipt says burnt umber.,52899,3
52899,"That is not what I orered, but I love the bag, just wish it was a different color.",52899,3
52899,Sad they can't call it what it is.,52899,3
52900,Had them only about a week and got a scratch already.,52900,3
52900,Use them only when driving my boat so not sure how this even happened.,52900,3
52900,Other than that i like them,52900,3
52901,"They're friggin' T-shirts, what kind of review could I possibly write that would make them anything but T-shirts.",52901,3
52901,"They showed up on time, price is reasonable, and they're white,(can I say white on Amazon?)",52901,3
52902,"The robe is nice enough, but the sizes run really really really small!",52902,3
52904,I ordered a large and i got a size XL and it still ended up barely fitting,52904,3
52905,Actual I use these to cammo' my outdoors gear.,52905,3
52905,I place them over the piece of equipment and spray paint over them.,52905,3
52906,The shield logo on the front starting peeling off about a week after I received the tank.,52906,3
52906,"The tank is a little bigger than I anticipated, so think about ordering a size smaller, but that's relative.",52906,3
52906,"Other than that, it's a pretty good tank.",52906,3
52907,"Ok quality, not bad for the price.",52907,3
52908,Ihope to lose wieght,52908,3
52909,The top fit fine but my bottom is way too big for a small too bad we cannot choose a larger bottem since i like the style.,52909,3
52910,The plastic hooks to clip nylons broke on the first use.,52910,3
52910,Otherwise it's a cute outfit.,52910,3
52910,Looks just like the picture,52910,3
52911,"It definitely was cute, but I was hoping for at least more than one seed in it.",52911,3
52912,Great except way to small but will seam rip and add some leather to the sides.,52912,3
52913,The pants aren't what I expected but you get what you pay for.,52913,3
52914,"This swimsuit looks gorgeous on picture, in reality, it's much simpler looking, but not too bad.",52914,3
52914,"Runs way too big, don't order a size up!",52914,3
52914,"Also, the fabric has an unbearable chemical odor, even after the wash.",52914,3
52914,"It's made in China, I guess, 'nuff said!",52914,3
52915,"I like it, but it's a little big.",52915,3
52915,I do like the material and style though.,52915,3
52915,I bought xs and I am 5'2 95 lbs and it comes down to my knees pretty much,52915,3
52917,"I have long feet, so I need men's sizes, but these too wide & long-
Oh well- I sleep in them after trying to shrink them!",52917,3
52918,Thought it would be a little bigger since I ordered a larger size,52918,3
52919,This is a lot shorter than I expected.,52919,3
52919,"I am 5'1"" and it comes mid thigh.",52919,3
52919,I will be giving to a younger person.,52919,3
52920,These are not true Genie Bras but are comfortable enough for the price.,52920,3
52921,I was expecting grey.,52921,3
52921,"Also no pockets, which makes it not suitable for casual wearing and running.",52921,3
52921,You can just put in on and chill at home or do some light exercise in it as it get warm really quick.,52921,3
52922,I got a small one earlier and thought it was too small.,52922,3
52922,I then got a medium.,52922,3
52922,It fits me well but I wish it would be longer like the picture showed.,52922,3
52922,I think the middle piece is too loose for me and needs to be redesigned.,52922,3
52923,I wear 36B bras so ordered a size Large according to their chart.,52923,3
52923,It fits really weird.,52923,3
52923,The ribcage area is kind of fitted but the shoulder straps are so far apart they kept sliding off my shoulders.,52923,3
52923,"Their customer service was excellent though and sent me a different style nursing tank top (also in size Large) that fit perfectly, with shoulder straps that are where I'd expect them to be on a tank top.",52923,3
52923,My measurements are 35-26-35.,52923,3
52923,"My advice is if you have similar measurements or wear a size 36B bra, go with a size Medium, or find the other nursing tank from the same seller that has very similar styling but doesn't come with pads in the chest area (it does have pockets for your own bra pads though).",52923,3
52924,"If you are looking to buy, you're running a high risk of not receiving exactly the type of shirt you ordered, keep that in mind.",52924,3
52924,"I ordered navy with white pattern, instead received the one in the pic.",52924,3
52925,skirt part just bunches up making the whole thing behave as a belt.,52925,3
52926,I bought one in April 2016 to bring back and forth to work.,52926,3
52926,"The wheels are not great, and the zipper broke after 4 months of use.",52926,3
52926,"For the price, it's still a good deal but no more than 3 stars.",52926,3
52926,I need this because of shoulder issues.,52926,3
52928,Looks much better in pictures,52928,3
52929,Print is beautiful but it doesn't flare out like the picture depicts.,52929,3
52930,Great color just a little big and cheaply made to me.,52930,3
52931,A cute belly chain but the material is a little thin and it is not for a girl that has a little bit larger waist than normal.,52931,3
52932,IT is a cute shirt,52932,3
52933,"The costume came when expected, but the bottoms fit smaller than the top.",52933,3
52933,It was ok quality for a costume.,52933,3
52934,Ran a little large for someone looking for tight fitting clothing.,52934,3
52934,"Other than that, seems exactly what I expected.",52934,3
52935,A little tighter than I wanted.,52935,3
52937,It's a nice sweater but runs very small.,52937,3
52937,If you want the sweater to fit like the picture order 2 sizes bigger.,52937,3
52937,Fiber quality not the best either.,52937,3
52938,Too big for my infant,52938,3
52939,"These are wide shoes for girls ,i ordered the pink pair and they are kinda baggy looking.i bought a size 2 little kids for a six year old.",52939,3
52939,Besides them being too wide they are nice when lit up and they both worked upon arrival.,52939,3
52940,Light weight..... but nice n cute,52940,3
52941,Smaller than I thought and more see-through than I anticipated but I guess I'll use them as motivation to lose weight.,52941,3
52942,I love the print and once I get it on it is very comfortable material.,52942,3
52942,It does run small.,52942,3
52942,I'm normally a medium/large so I bought a large but it's a little tight.,52942,3
52942,The material does stretch with each wash.,52942,3
52942,I go to a stretch/toning class and this holds up well.,52942,3
52942,I can stretch without reveling anything.,52942,3
52942,Sweat goes right through it.,52942,3
52942,It does not absorb anything.,52942,3
52943,Actually had to return it unused as the size was too small for my large wrist.,52943,3
52943,I wish they had it in exiling,52943,3
52944,"Sizes run small, but a nice hat",52944,3
52945,Okay but hurt my son's feet,52945,3
52946,I purchased this item in a size smaller.,52946,3
52946,I reordered in a larger size and it was too large in the bust and shoulder area.,52946,3
52946,"Overall, the dress is beautiful.",52946,3
52947,I like the dress expect i wish they had 2 pockets instead of just 1,52947,3
52948,Was told that they would fit up to a one year old my granddaughter is only a month old and they don't fit,52948,3
52949,i love these but they came with a hole in the toe and a run on the thigh on one side i only wore them only twice before i had to throw them out,52949,3
52950,I love the shirt however it was not sized correctly,52950,3
52952,It fits fine but a bit larger than i expected .KInda baggy at the bottom.,52952,3
52952,I would not say it has the usual Columbia quality to it.,52952,3
52952,I also was displeased that it advertised a zippered security pocket which I have yet to find.,52952,3
52952,"If anyone has found theirs, I'd like to know where it is since mine seems to be a little too secure.",52952,3
52953,love the look but the ear piece is not completely flush with your ears.,52953,3
52953,Instead they are stiff and at an angle.,52953,3
52954,"It COST ME $100.00 Dollar's just to have it fixed, to fit her and not be to long!!",52954,3
52955,It was like the one on the mannequin.,52955,3
52955,Idk I would maybe wear it under a fitted jacket and tight pants to save it from looking so cheap but lol it'll probably stay in my closet since its from China I'm not going to bother returning it,52955,3
52956,very light and cute.,52956,3
52956,I notice that the toe area is cut short and round.,52956,3
52956,these must be made in China.,52956,3
52956,more and more flip flops have a very peculiar cut around the toes.,52956,3
52956,are Chinese toes different?,52956,3
52957,Returned this item because it was to small!,52957,3
52958,Fabric quality and styling are acceptable but the sizing run extremely small.,52958,3
52958,"I normally wear size 4-6 petite (hips 37"") and I ordered a large.",52958,3
52958,I couldn't zip these shorts.,52958,3
52958,I do like them so will return for size XXL.,52958,3
52960,"I'm 5'4"" and 120 pounds.",52960,3
52960,I usually wear XS or S and ordered a small in this top.,52960,3
52960,It is way too big.,52960,3
52960,"I can wear it with leggings, but it swallows me.",52960,3
52961,This is one of those that's hard to rate.,52961,3
52961,"It just depends on how pregnant you are, and how you grow during pregnancy.",52961,3
52961,"I ordered this while I was 20 weeks pregnant in a medium (I'm about 5' 2"" and pre pregnancy weight about 125) I hadn't gained much weight but figured a medium would be best since other medium maternity clothes fit my chest.",52961,3
52961,"For this particular shirt it was quite a bit bigger than I would have expected, and my biggest complaint is the elastic on the sides.",52961,3
52961,"It bunches up much more than any other maternity shirt I have, so much so that it shows skin if I wiggle too much.",52961,3
52961,"Besides that it's an adorable shirt, I was just dissapointed with the sides more than anything, especially considering how short I am.",52961,3
52962,Product seems hypoallergenic like it promises.,52962,3
52962,I've been wearing a pair for hrs now & no irritation.,52962,3
52962,But there weren't enough backs for all the earrings.,52962,3
52962,Also one of the backs was dammaged & won't hold long.,52962,3
52962,Still a good but.,52962,3
52962,I recommend getting safety backs with this order.,52962,3
52964,My son LOVES these boots!!!,52964,3
52965,This seems like it would be a good product for people with the right body type.,52965,3
52965,"I am a 34D and the cups are too small but the bra itself is too large (I bought a large, based on other reviews).",52965,3
52965,I'll be returning this product.,52965,3
52965,If you have a smaller frame but a large chest I wouldn't recommend this product.,52965,3
52965,"Otherwise, it seems well made; it's unfortunate that it doesn't fit properly.",52965,3
52966,"But wrinkles too easy, sleeves are baggy no form fitting .",52966,3
52967,Runs small my shirts are medium and I got the large and it was still small for me.,52967,3
52967,Very nice material and it would of been good if size was right.,52967,3
52968,The webbing is not as stout as I would have hoped.,52968,3
52968,"And the D-rings are a little too big,  which allows for some rotation of the d-rings as you cinch down on the belt.",52968,3
52968,"Considering how inexpensive they are, I can't complain too much.",52968,3
52969,I think it's cute and I'm glad it fits.,52969,3
52969,I just think it's a bit too thin and wrinkles easily.,52969,3
52969,It's really a matter of taste though and the price is good!,52969,3
52970,I don't like Chinese sizes,52970,3
52971,"Higher quality than I expected, but it's too big.",52971,3
52971,"I am 5'6"" and 135 lbs.",52971,3
52971,"Typically I wear a small, sometimes a medium.",52971,3
52971,I ordered this in XS only because they didn't have the small available with prime.,52971,3
52971,Even the XS is too big.,52971,3
52971,It goes down to my knees and is very loose.,52971,3
52971,"If that's what you are looking for, this is a great purchase.",52971,3
52971,I am looking for more of a cover up and less of a dress so I'll be returning.,52971,3
52972,This is a great glasses case.,52972,3
52972,"The hinge could take your finger off when it closes, keeping your glasses securely intact during transport.",52972,3
52972,The colors are exceptional and vibrant and the case it tough as nails.,52972,3
52972,"I would give this five stars but...

the inside of the case is falling out of the outer shell.",52972,3
52972,"It appears they should be form fitted together, but mine is starting to pull away from the sides.",52972,3
52972,Disheartening that such a small thing renders a great product semi-useless.,52972,3
52973,The top is completely see-through.,52973,3
52973,The material was better then expected.,52973,3
52973,The only issue was the sleeves are very short.,52973,3
52973,"I am 5'0, size 14.",52973,3
52975,It works as expected according to the price.,52975,3
52975,My only complaint is about the color.,52975,3
52975,"The picture shown here is a light baby blue, but the actual color is way brighter.",52975,3
52975,It doesn't really match our bathroom color theme.,52975,3
52976,"The style of the dress is very nice, but the dress is poorly constructed.",52976,3
52976,The bodice sticks out in the wrong places and gapes under the arms.,52976,3
52976,"If the dress had been constructed better, it would be a beautiful dress.",52976,3
52977,I ordered a double x based on customer reviews.,52977,3
52977,"I am not a big girl, but very curvy.",52977,3
52977,Super mad it was still tight!,52977,3
52978,I thought it would be tighter,52978,3
52979,"Oddly shape on top, fitted great below the bust but somehow the top part/straps are too long providing not support or lift whatsoever.",52979,3
52980,"Wasn't overly excited , just ok",52980,3
52981,I purchased two of these stones.,52981,3
52981,"The quartz does not look very natural, it has a plastic look and opalescent sheen to it.",52981,3
52981,"They are pretty, so I continue to use them.",52981,3
52982,"Fun sweater for our office Christmas Party; however, one of the lights pulled out of the sweater as soon as I put it on.",52982,3
52983,The material is soft and comfortable.,52983,3
52983,It is true to size.,52983,3
52983,Only weird thing it's that the pockets are a little buffy and made me look at little more chunky.,52983,3
52983,Over all its nice and comfortable.,52983,3
52984,This dress is not made for tall people.,52984,3
52984,"Very cute and great fit overall, but I won't be able to sit down.",52984,3
52984,I'm 6 ft tall and all sizes had the same length.,52984,3
52984,Unsure if I want to pair it will leggings yet or just not sit.,52984,3
52985,Cute but after the first wash and dry it shrank to a small tshirt size!,52985,3
52986,Beautiful set of jewellery.,52986,3
52987,Ordered an xl for my husband.,52987,3
52987,It fit my 9 year old.,52987,3
52987,But cool shirt for my 9 year old.,52987,3
52988,And too short to wear as a dress,52988,3
52989,It will serve its purpose.,52989,3
52990,"It was to small , but this company let me keep the product and returned my money with an amazon gift card .",52990,3
52991,It should Hold your belly in more to make it flatter,52991,3
52992,Price is great but the lenses don't fit perfectly.,52992,3
52992,One falls out very easily,52992,3
52993,The product is good but these are not for right sided shirts.,52993,3
52994,"Bought for work about a month ago, have worn them about 15 times and they are already coming apart in the crotch.",52994,3
52995,I gave this 3 stars because it very nice if you can get in it.,52995,3
52995,I ordered biggest they offered.,52995,3
52995,Yeah my 11 year old granddaughter couldn't get in it.,52995,3
52995,"If you are willowy than by all means, order them.",52995,3
52995,"But if you run bigger than a medium, don't bother.",52995,3
52995,Can't wear none of them.,52995,3
52995,"I'm 5'5"", wear a 12.",52995,3
52995,Couldn't even get it on.,52995,3
52996,"It's ok for indoors, only.",52996,3
52997,Tight top needs to be stretched.,52997,3
52997,Have not been able to wear because of the top being Too tight.,52997,3
52997,I think they are as advertised  except for top,52997,3
52999,"I really wanted to love this - the overall fit and the silhouette it created was beautiful, but I have a very large bust that just wasn't contained by this top.",52999,3
52999,"It wasn't too tight, but the waist seam hit in the middle of my boobs instead of underneath.",52999,3
52999,"Seller offered a partial refund and let me keep the shirt, which was nice.",52999,3
53000,This product didn't work for me.,53000,3
53000,The manufacturer was kind enough to extend a full refund!,53000,3
53000,I will be happy to try another product by them.,53000,3
53000,Their support was very much appreciated.,53000,3
53002,"This bathing suit does the job, by fitting fairly unexpectedly, but it does feel very cheap.",53002,3
53002,"The material is fairly stiff, and the beads broke off after two washes.",53002,3
53002,For the price it is not bad though.,53002,3
53003,"Good quality, but not made for anyone with thighs",53003,3
53004,I purchased this Disney Star Wars BB-8 Rubber LED Watch for my 6 year old.,53004,3
53004,"He likes Star Wars, always wants to know what time it is, and loves the feel of rubbery items so this seemed perfect.",53004,3
53004,He's a bit of a sensory seeker and having something close by to feel helps him stay on task and not end up chewing his fingernails or messing with his clothing.,53004,3
53004,"He loved the watch for about a week, until where it bends on either side of the face started to crack and the top layer of paint came off.",53004,3
53004,"Even though it's an orange and white watch, when it chipped, it now has a pink tinge to it and he won't wear it because he's afraid people will make fun of his pink watch.",53004,3
53004,He's very disappointed that it didn't last longer.,53004,3
53004,I have since bought him a different style of watch.,53004,3
53005,Product looks durable and seems value for money.,53005,3
53005,One of these shipped was wrong size.,53005,3
53006,Super wide and fall off my face.,53006,3
53006,The right arm are already stretched out when they came.,53006,3
53006,Decent looking for how cheap they are.,53006,3
53007,It's cute but your body must be in perfect shape the bra part don't hold DD and the side open part is very revealing,53007,3
53008,Too big but cute outfit,53008,3
53009,This item should indicate that it runs small!!,53009,3
53010,Fabric is nice but socks are two wide and saggy for my narrow feet and slim ankles.,53010,3
53011,Its hot and non-breathable material to be wearing on a hot sunny beach!,53011,3
53011,Other than that I love it.,53011,3
53011,I wear it around my house cause its too hot for outside!,53011,3
53012,fast shipping good packaging.,53012,3
53012,not the best quality and a little big,53012,3
53014,"Nice Outfit, just too snug.",53014,3
53014,Ordered a Large and fit like a Small.,53014,3
53015,The letters are smaller than they look in the picture but the sweater only costs $6,53015,3
53016,The black stripes on the dress bled onto the white of the dress after I washed the dress.,53016,3
53016,There was no tag with washing instructions on the dress.,53016,3
53016,I washed on cold gentle cycle and the black still bled onto the white.,53016,3
53016,"Can't wear the dress again, had to throw it away.",53016,3
53016,Dress material is very poor quality.,53016,3
53017,Totally different belt than was pictured but if I would have read the description I would have realized that.,53017,3
53017,Still a very pretty belt.,53017,3
53017,Just not what I thought I was getting.,53017,3
53018,I SO wanted to love this dress.,53018,3
53018,"The print is adorable, and the dress was very sturdy and well made, with a lining included, which was awesome.",53018,3
53018,I love the material.,53018,3
53018,"BUT- the ""high waist"" was entirely too high.",53018,3
53018,"Like, comically too high.",53018,3
53018,"Dont get me wrong, I love a good empire/high waisted dress.",53018,3
53018,This dress ended up looking like a tent.,53018,3
53018,"If the waist was even slightly lower (I ordered a medium,  and the waist still cut across the bottoms of my breasts ) I could at least belt it, and it would have still looked cute.",53018,3
53018,"Sadly, I have to return it.",53018,3
53018,No way I can wear it.,53018,3
53018,I loved every else about it.,53018,3
53018,"I've already placed orders for two more elf sack dresses, so I hope they'll fit okay.",53018,3
53019,Beautiful shirt but not as long as it shows in the picture.,53019,3
53019,Haven't even worn it yet because it doesn't fit like it shows.,53019,3
53019,"Made well, just not what it says t will be.",53019,3
53020,"Item was very nice, but the conversion size was totally off.",53020,3
53020,I ordered American size 7 and got a shirt about a toddler size.,53020,3
53021,I wear it all the time.,53021,3
53021,I just don't know if it's doing anything for my arthritis.,53021,3
53022,"It's a bit short, and the V-neck, which looks so stylish on photo, doesn't quite holds its shape...",53022,3
53022,"But overall the blouse is OK, I've got a couple of compliments.",53022,3
53023,"When it arrived the pieces of the necklace with separated from the necklace,  I had to glue several pieces back on the necklace, now it looks good.",53023,3
53025,"I ordered a 36C because the 34C's I have (of a different brand nursing bra) are on the last hook, but I fill the cup pretty well so I figured I'd go a little more broad with this purchase.",53025,3
53025,"Well, I got these in the 36C, tried on, and well, there was A LOT of room to fill in the cup!!!",53025,3
53025,I returned and got a 36B... still my boobs are barely filling the cup.,53025,3
53025,"I'm hoping a wash will shrink it up a little... Or when I actually have my baby in the next 4 weeks, my boobs will fill them out better then.",53025,3
53025,I like these bra's... pretty and very soft... but sizing is just off =(,53025,3
53026,I have only worn this a few times but the yellow plating has almost worn totally off.,53026,3
53026,I has gone from looking too yellow (22k look) to minimally yellow (9k).,53026,3
53026,I still give it points because the stones are really sparkling in the right evening light and there is minimal prong action.,53026,3
53027,It's very pretty but it was to big in the hip area,53027,3
53028,The belt is attractive and arrived in a cute gift box.,53028,3
53028,"However, I can't figure out how to adjust it.",53028,3
53028,Will have to ask my husband for help which is always a bummer.,53028,3
53029,"I can't write a review for these sunglasses, because I've never ordered them, so I gave a rating of 3 in  the middle.",53029,3
53030,"It is plenty large but too short,",53030,3
53031,"Shirt is great, but the tread on skirt was coming up when I got it but good for the price",53031,3
53032,Loops could be bigger and chain should be longer.,53032,3
53032,Barely fits me and I'm a guy.,53032,3
53032,Manufacturer should disclose length.,53032,3
53033,Nice dress...but it is too small and pretty thin material.,53033,3
53033,It's stretchy but does run small.,53033,3
53033,I would have to order about 2 sizes up for this to fit.,53033,3
53033,It is pretty and sexy but I will have to return.,53033,3
53033,"Based on the thinness of the material, I will not re-order.",53033,3
53033,I can just imagine how it would look after a wash or two.,53033,3
53034,"Gets the job done but quite too large, appears more like a chef's cap.",53034,3
53035,"This is not a tailored fit, so it hangs loose around the waist area.",53035,3
53035,"So if that is your preference, this is a good shirt.",53035,3
53035,"The material is nice feeling, and lightweight; but snags easy because that is what this type of cloth does.",53035,3
53035,The maroon color does not show sweat very much and this would depend on the color you pick.,53035,3
53036,Exactly what I thought it would be for the price.,53036,3
53036,Cute for a little girl though.,53036,3
53037,"I am 5'5"" 125 lbs and I ordered a small, my waist is about 25-26 inches.",53037,3
53037,"Overall it seems to big, it doesn't feel tight where it should and it feels too long.",53037,3
53037,I am returning this trainer to find something shorter that seems to be smaller in the middle not just straight up and down.,53037,3
53038,Not as long or sheer as the photo.,53038,3
53038,Nice addition to my wardrobe to add color though,53038,3
53039,Cute but not of very good quality.,53039,3
53040,Front of backpack and lunch bag is sparkly.,53040,3
53040,I wasn't expecting it.,53040,3
53040,"Makes it look a bit too girly for my son, and it makes its almost to bright to look at in the sun.",53040,3
53041,"comfortable, but be careful as these will shrink a lot.",53041,3
53041,they were already a bit snug when i tried them on initially and i washed them in cold water and dried them on ultra low heat and they still shrunk enough to where the legs now hit at mid-calf.,53041,3
53043,Shorter than I expected.,53043,3
53043,"I'm 5""5 and was hoping for a little more length, felt too uncomfortable bare legged.",53043,3
53044,It fit my grandson...I spent time in SEA and the Asian sizes are not exactly the same as ours but it is a good looking shirt and well made.,53044,3
53046,Much more sheer than I anticipated.,53046,3
53046,We used this for family pictures and I had to buy a body slip for underneath it.,53046,3
53047,Pretty but the lace part curls up,53047,3
53048,But after putting it on twice the elastic is already stretched out...,53048,3
53048,"I can still wear it, but it's just a little baggier on my wrist than it was the first time i put it on...",53048,3
53048,"I'm worried that over time the elastic will stretch too much and break or not hold, but in the meantime I'm gonna wear it all the time!",53048,3
53048,It might end up being perfect.,53048,3
53048,"I've had other malas not made of elastic, the elastic on this one does make it easier to wrap and wear it as a bracelet.",53048,3
53049,Color is beautiful and picture.,53049,3
53049,This is just a costume jewelry.,53049,3
53049,"A little pricie, my friend bought one at the dollar store.",53049,3
53050,so far they are nice.,53050,3
53050,"i am very partial to the tint that sunglasses have though and these ones, while fire red reflective has a blue tint when looking through.",53050,3
53050,I love the amber tint so im kinda annoyed but its not the end of the world.,53050,3
53051,"The colors are a bit deceiving, as the pink is much more pink in real life, too much for my liking.",53051,3
53051,The fit is nice though and I like the design,53051,3
53052,Runs a little small but I do love the colors.,53052,3
53053,The fabric is lighter than I expected and so it's see through.,53053,3
53053,The fit is good and it hits your waist in a slimming way.,53053,3
53054,"Too short and a bit wide on top, so regular bras do not work",53054,3
53055,"It ripped an hour after wearing it, and it fits somewhat too large.",53055,3
53056,perfect for teenage daughter,53056,3
53057,top is too big,53057,3
53058,buy at least 2 sizes up,53058,3
53059,"It fits well, but I really wish it was just a couple of inches longer.",53059,3
53059,"I so wanted to wear this as a dress, but it's going to be tough to pull it off.",53059,3
53060,"First of all, I love the design of this dress, but it does run small.",53060,3
53060,"I usually wear a 2, but I bought a 4 just to be safe, but I probably should have gotten a 6.",53060,3
53060,I had to cut the sash off this dress to wear it.,53060,3
53060,It's not a sash that ties around the waist.,53060,3
53060,"It's a ribbon sewn into the back that you need to step through, so it can't be adjusted.",53060,3
53060,"It made me look very bloated, so I like the dress much better without it.",53060,3
53060,"Second of all, I couldn't wear any sort of bra with this.",53060,3
53060,I have neither a large nor small chest- I'm a 34C.,53060,3
53060,"All in all, with Spanx and no bra, I was able to squeeze into it without it looking or feeling ill-fitting.",53060,3
53060,"I'm also 5'10"" and it fell about four inches above the knee.",53060,3
53060,"Gorgeous dress, color is just like the picture, but order about 2 sizes up.",53060,3
53061,This is not an off the shoulder shirt the neck was very small otherwise the fit was as stated,53061,3
53062,"These pants are so pretty, looks just like the picture and arrived super fast and early.",53062,3
53062,However the pants are see through and way too small.,53062,3
53062,I usually wear a large but I read reviews and decided to order and xl and they were still to small,53062,3
53064,I got this in pink.,53064,3
53064,It came quicker than expected about a week.,53064,3
53064,The tracking information is all wrong.,53064,3
53064,I am 110 lbs and slim built.,53064,3
53064,I got a small size.,53064,3
53064,It fit fine but unfortunately the light colour shows up everything as the material is so thin.,53064,3
53064,The make and design though is so beautiful.,53064,3
53064,Get a darker colour so that your underwear Etc is not visible.,53064,3
53065,"This dress is so cute, but my boobs were a little to large and the type of material doesn't give, so I felt restricted in the chest area when I tried it on.",53065,3
53065,"Overall, it felt well everywhere else.",53065,3
53065,I ordered a 3x,53065,3
53066,Chain is pretty cheap and broke but is still a great buy.,53066,3
53067,I like this sweater for the price.,53067,3
53067,I don't know what exactly I was expecting so there was nothing to be let down about.,53067,3
53067,The sweater is thinner than I anticipated but it still will be a cute addition to my fall wardrobe.,53067,3
53067,The material is a little itchy though and I don't know if that will become a problem or not.,53067,3
53067,I would not advise to order if you're on the taller side.,53067,3
53067,I am 5'0'' and the sleeves are kind of short even for my taste.,53067,3
53068,A camisole is needed for this shirt.,53068,3
53069,"I bought this as a gift for my younger brother for his birthday, he likes the color and I want to eventually show him the show, as we watch much anime together.",53069,3
53069,"I would not say this is a fully bad product, as the swirls are much more detailed than the Mero Mero no Mi also sold by similar companies, and the picture is more accurate, but it still lacks so much.",53069,3
53069,"The stem broke by it just tipping over and hitting our dining table, or falling a foot onto the floor.",53069,3
53069,"Extremely poor quality, and hard to hold in.",53069,3
53069,"Fruit is sturdy as a tank, though.",53069,3
53070,they get the job done and are good for chillin.,53070,3
53070,"I have big legs so they definitely aren't as ""baggy"" as advertised for someone that at least attempts leg day every now and again",53070,3
53071,These are great for the price.,53071,3
53071,"I will share however that the backside isn't very appealing (quite cheap
Looking), I wouldn't buy these if I have really short hair where people can see from the back.",53071,3
53072,"just ok - cheap, plastic-like material, but it was inexpensive so I guess I should have expected that.",53072,3
53073,"Cute in the picture; however, not very well made.",53073,3
53073,"The pattern doesn't meet up at the seams, but the fabric and stitching has quality.",53073,3
53073,"Looks cheap, but ok enough to wear grocery shopping, not for a night on the town with a pair of cute heels.",53073,3
53074,"Nice coat, but never would have bought it if I have seen the review of it being the wrong color!",53074,3
53074,Still a nice coat but change the color name to cream.,53074,3
53075,the bows are just too much,53075,3
53076,"Given that I thought I was ordering 5 of these and got only one, I am not real happy about that.",53076,3
53076,The one that I got was not one that was pictured.,53076,3
53076,"What ever, it is a cute bag.",53076,3
53076,It will hold loose change and such without difficulty.,53076,3
53076,"Still, I needed 5 of these and so must reorder.",53076,3
53076,"This one took several weeks to get here, I don't expect the re-order will arrive in time.",53076,3
53076,But you do what you have to do.,53076,3
53077,Runs about one dress size smaller than indicated.,53077,3
53078,more pliable would help to adjust the tubing.,53078,3
53079,The dress runs small all over.,53079,3
53079,The fabric is thin and somewhat see-through.,53079,3
53079,"I wanted to wear it to my baby shower, but I did not find it to be appropriate for that venue - maybe a concert, but definitely not for a classy event",53079,3
53080,"These are ok, but I've had more comfortable yoga pants before.",53080,3
53080,I think they could use a bit more stretch in the material.,53080,3
53081,"Okay I'm a rather busty/curvy girl, but this isn't just a little too short - it's even a little too short for me to wear as a shirt.",53081,3
53081,"I didn't send it back, because I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle, but I was disappointed with This.",53081,3
53081,"However, it might work okay with a longer tank top and some leggings.",53081,3
53081,"It is also made of a very thin material, and since I got white, it's extremely see-through.",53081,3
53083,"great deal, was too small, had to order another one.",53083,3
53084,Bought this as a gift.,53084,3
53084,Was disappointed to find that it fits an entire size smaller!,53084,3
53084,My mother wears a 2X so that's what I ordered.,53084,3
53084,She needs a 3X in this nightgown.,53084,3
53085,"If you have a larger chest, the sides will be exposed and bulge out.",53085,3
53086,I ordered a large when I usually wear a medium and they were still too small.,53086,3
53086,"Also, each color runs a bit different in size.",53086,3
53086,The pink one fit a bit larger than the green one.,53086,3
53087,Very cheaply made- does not fit back into the bag.,53087,3
53088,The picture and the actual product are two different things.,53088,3
53088,The product is cheaply made and ill fitting.,53088,3
53089,Cute shoes just thought they be smaller for a newborn.,53089,3
53090,small for its size,53090,3
53091,It is good for its price,53091,3
53092,"I'm used to other brands sizes, so the medium size of this product runs a little small for me",53092,3
53093,But not too modest.,53093,3
53093,It sticks to the skin and the material is very thin.,53093,3
53094,It was too big on me and my co-worker bought it from me.,53094,3
53095,nice shirt but runs small,53095,3
53096,"Seems well made, but very small even though I went by the size chart.",53096,3
53096,Order up one or two sizes up,53096,3
53097,"While everything else fit perfectly, the cups were too small and there was a slight flaw in the stitching causing one of the cups to look...folded in?",53097,3
53097,I will have to return this item.,53097,3
53097,Would recommend for those who do not have large breasts.,53097,3
53097,"Or if they do, breasts that stay in the same place at all times.",53097,3
53097,(Like the woman in the picture),53097,3
53098,For the price it is okay.,53098,3
53099,It's a beautiful print and material but it's shaped funny.,53099,3
53099,I am 5'5 32DD and the top did not cover my parts,53099,3
53100,"I'm not sure how to make this better... maybe less bulk, maybe more stable?",53100,3
53100,I never owned any other product like this and it basically does what I thought it would do which is to hold my glasses in a safe place where they won't get scratched.,53100,3
53100,I have one on my desk and plan to buy another for the night stand.,53100,3
53101,Cute but waaaay too small.,53101,3
53101,Order two sizes up to get what you actually need.,53101,3
53102,"I do not review too often, however I felt the need to on these.",53102,3
53102,I ordered one size up as every other review said and should have gone up two.,53102,3
53102,They run very small and are very low cut.,53102,3
53102,"I have a butt on me, but these barely went up over it.",53102,3
53102,The thighs run small too.,53102,3
53102,"They quality and feel of the jean is very nice though, and they are super cute just way too small.",53102,3
53103,This dress is so cute!,53103,3
53103,My daughter loves it and received compliments the first day she wore it.,53103,3
53103,"Only negative is it fits so snug, which was surprising because my two year old is petite and anything bigger than a size two is usually too big.",53103,3
53103,"Order a size or two up, just in case.",53103,3
53104,"Very pretty, but the waist is just too big, even though I bought the smallest size.",53104,3
53105,"graphic is great...materials are thin, slippery, curls a bit...gonna keep it though...because of the graphic and the low price",53105,3
53106,"I love this jumpsuit but it is too small, is there any way to return it for a bigger size?",53106,3
53107,"The earrings are beautiful, however the posts are huge.",53107,3
53107,I prefer a regular size post.,53107,3
53107,The backs are hard to get on and off the posts; perhaps with time they might work easier.,53107,3
53108,I thought it is a little bit smaller then what that bag actually is.,53108,3
53108,Great quality but the size is the proble.,53108,3
53109,This is a cute set but not exactly my taste when I received it.,53109,3
53110,I really liked this dress but is was way too short on me.,53110,3
53110,"I also have a longer torso, so the high empire waist just wasn't as flattering as it could be.",53110,3
53111,"I love this dress, but it's too short, I am 5.4 I ordered a Small and even ordered a Medium, still was too short.",53111,3
53112,This is a fairly nice looking purse.,53112,3
53112,"However, if rattling noises bother you, I wouldn't recommmend this purse.",53112,3
53112,"The buckle/hardware on the straps makes a lot of noise, mainly when driving.",53112,3
53112,One side of the strap keeps loosening up which makes it longer than the other.,53112,3
53112,The result is the strap keeps slipping off my shoulder.,53112,3
53112,"Also, neither the exterior or interior pockets hold my iPhone 6 so it just gets thrown in the purse with everything else.",53112,3
53112,I'll probably use it close to Christmas time since it's a nice deep red color.,53112,3
53112,"I gave it 3 stars because it does look nice and has some inner pockets for separating makeup receipts, etc.",53112,3
53113,The bottom rolls up,53113,3
53114,I love the style of this swimsuit.,53114,3
53114,It's too big on top area and I am a size D.  The straps that connect the top are easy to slip out of place and come undone.,53114,3
53114,I used some pliers to close them so it no longer comes loose.,53114,3
53114,"I usually wear a size 14 but it's always tight all over, so this time I ordered a 16.",53114,3
53114,"I like that it's not too tight that I can easily put it back on when wet if I needed to take it off, but the upper part was too big for me (again even at a D cup).",53114,3
53114,** I was able to purchase this item at a discount for my honest review.,53114,3
53115,This is a super cute top!,53115,3
53115,"I am 5'2"" and about 190lbs.",53115,3
53115,I am very proportional and don't carry all my weight in one spot.,53115,3
53115,I ordered an xl and couldn't get this over my arms!,53115,3
53115,The arms were created for someone much smaller!,53115,3
53115,"It's like they added more material to the rest of the shirt to make it an xl, but forgot to add some to the shirt.",53115,3
53115,They were gracious and did a partial refund and I get to keep it.,53115,3
53115,I wish it would have fit!,53115,3
53116,would never buy again.,53116,3
53117,I wear 16/18 pants and they say to order XL according to their website.,53117,3
53117,It was so large I couldn't wear it.,53117,3
53117,I contacted the company but no response from them.,53117,3
53117,Otherwise the belt is a very nice product at a cheap price but now I'm out $9 for nothing.,53117,3
53118,I wear a size 12 and I ordered a size 16 for this due to excessive boobage.,53118,3
53118,It still barely fits!,53118,3
53119,needs to be resized,53119,3
53120,Have to wear pretty heavy sock for them to fit snug - once they break in shouldn't be a problem.,53120,3
53120,"Comfortable right out of the box, We'll see after a 12 hour shift standing in them.",53120,3
53121,"I only received 4 of the 6 cubes that i was charged for... besides that, the cubes are pretty well made and i was surprised i could pack so much into the small space.",53121,3
53123,Top is a bit different than shown.,53123,3
53123,"Mine was not cut well at the neckline, and is a little lower than pictured.",53123,3
53123,Runs small but has good stretch.,53123,3
53123,I should have returned it as it did not go with what I intended to wear it with.,53123,3
53123,Since it's white I am sure I will spill something on it the first time I wear it.,53123,3
53124,Quality deteriorates over time which is a challenging scenario in the online purchases.,53124,3
53124,This is no different but worked well for the first few weeks.,53124,3
53125,Quality  did not meet my expectation,53125,3
53126,"Love the style, but its not for girls with long arms....",53126,3
53127,Looks good - ok,53127,3
53128,The bottoms are perfect but the top was really big,53128,3
53129,A little snug and you can see through it,53129,3
53130,This shirt is ADORABLE but be prepared to see some SERIOUS FADING after the FIRST WASH!!!!,53130,3
53131,"This petticoat is really cute and does its job, but the sizing on it is very large.",53131,3
53131,I have pinned about 6 inches of the waist so that I can wear it.,53131,3
53131,"Having done so, I really like it.",53131,3
53132,Cute T-shirt but I thought after reading reviews that it would run very small so I got an XL.,53132,3
53132,I would have done better with a medium or large.,53132,3
53133,not the nicest finish,53133,3
53134,"5'2"" 165 lbs

I really should have gotten a size Large instead of an XL.",53134,3
53134,"It was my mistake that I bought a bigger size for myself, but this should fit a person who is actually an XL-size perfectly.",53134,3
53134,"Besides that, the skirt portion is way too bulky and is made of heavy material.",53134,3
53134,"If you want to hide your stomach, this dress is perfect for that.",53134,3
53134,There is a stretchy waistband and the top's material is also stretchy.,53134,3
53134,"If anything, I would recommend sizing down if you want the dress to fit snugly on top and at the waist.",53134,3
53135,"I do like it, but seems cheaply made.",53135,3
53135,A few of the seams are fraying and coming apart.,53135,3
53135,I've only worn it once.,53135,3
53136,I received this bag and thought it was great until I went to use the main compartment zipper.,53136,3
53136,I pulled on the zipper and it completely came off.,53136,3
53136,Apparently it was broken before I received it.,53136,3
53136,Not very happy about this even though I think it's a great bag for what I need.,53136,3
53137,"I returned this suitcase, as it's a little big too little.",53137,3
53137,"Airlines wil allow up to 22"" and I pack for a week, so I need all I can get.",53137,3
53137,"Quality seemed ok, but then, I did't use it to try out the wheels/handles, etc",53137,3
53138,One was perfect but the other one won't open!,53138,3
53138,Neither of the wings will budge no matter what!,53138,3
53139,The dress was too large I had to wear a shirt under it.,53139,3
53139,The gloves barely fit and only because I have small hands was I able to wear them.,53139,3
53139,It turned out cute because I did put some effort into it.,53139,3
53139,I rather the dress was too big than too small,53139,3
53140,A little too big for me,53140,3
53141,For a dress Its a little short for a shirt its way to baggy,53141,3
53142,It does all that it says it does.,53142,3
53142,"The magnets are rather weak, more than 6 bills is pushing it.",53142,3
53143,Pajama itself is great!,53143,3
53143,"However, I was disappointed to find out the sleeves were actually long, instead of how they are shown on picture.",53143,3
53143,We live in Florida and really prefer to have short sleeve pjs.,53143,3
53143,"Almost returned it but once my son saw the pjs, there was no way to take them away!",53143,3
53144,Cute for a child but rather cheaply made.,53144,3
53146,had to get it fix.,53146,3
53147,"Very pretty, but didn't hold up for my first one week trip to Europe.",53147,3
53148,I thought for my body type (straight) they didn't fit as well as other nydj styles,53148,3
53150,Pretty but did not see the brass coated gold material.,53150,3
53150,Did not return and decided not to gift them in case they tarnish.,53150,3
53150,Have not worn yet.,53150,3
53151,a little loose and see-through but the design is pretty,53151,3
53152,Looks like a maternity dress.,53152,3
53152,"Where the two fabrics are attached, it ruffles out as a maternity dress would.",53152,3
53152,Not flattering at all.,53152,3
53152,"Also, I am 5'1 and ordered a small and it is way too short.",53152,3
53152,I will wear it to the beach over my bathing suit.,53152,3
53153,runs small but very cute on,53153,3
53154,I wore this for my 20 year anniversary celebration.,53154,3
53154,It fit great and I looked good.,53154,3
53154,The only problem is I got black smudges on my skin from the dress.,53154,3
53154,Apparently the black die rubs off!,53154,3
53155,"I really like them, good quality  but runs small I am 5'4 weight 125lbs.",53155,3
53155,And acording to the reviews I ordered L. And still tight.,53155,3
53155,"I very hard to zip,  the first worked good and the second the zipper opens and stacked  Can't fixed.",53155,3
53156,Smaller than you'd expect.,53156,3
53156,Order a size big.,53156,3
53157,"Very pretty watch, elegant.",53157,3
53157,But it broke on the third day,53157,3
53158,"Cute, but not for a foot with high arch",53158,3
53159,Product was ripped when it arrived and I ended up returning it since I had planned to use it for a specific event and I did not have enough time to replace.,53159,3
53159,It looked like it would have otherwise work well.,53159,3
53160,This hat is OK.,53160,3
53160,It served it's purpose.,53160,3
53160,"It was light, like I wanted it to be.",53160,3
53160,"HOWEVER, the description said ""slouch"" and that is misleading.",53160,3
53160,It is NOT a slouch hat at all.,53160,3
53160,Keep the word out if that's not what it is.,53160,3
53160,"So I'm disappointed, won't keep it , and will give it away.",53160,3
53160,"But as I said, it served it's purpose.",53160,3
53161,This shirt is no where as long as it's presented in the picture.,53161,3
53161,It is cute though and seems to be quality fabric.,53161,3
53161,"I can still wear it, but it ends right at my pants.",53161,3
53161,It needs about 3 inches of length to be the correct shirt length for me.,53161,3
53161,"The lace back is cute, just really wish it would have been longer.",53161,3
53161,I'm about 5'7 and weigh 225 and ordered an xl.,53161,3
53162,It's not as shiny as the picture looks.,53162,3
53162,It comes a little big but it hangs low enough to now be such a bother.,53162,3
53162,It looks amazing on my gf though.,53162,3
53162,Good necklace for Dr. Who lovers,53162,3
53163,I bought this dress for a destination wedding in Mexico.,53163,3
53163,"As it was the dead of winter I knew I wanted something long enough to cover my pasty white legs, but flowey and summery enough to stay cool.",53163,3
53163,"This dress is very beautiful and shockingly enough a bit too long (this doesn't happen often I'm 5'10"" maybe pushing 5'11"").",53163,3
53163,I ordered a medium as that is generally what I wear.,53163,3
53163,The dress was a little baggier than I would have liked and the neck chain in the halter turned my neck green.,53163,3
53163,I still got a lot of compliments on it though and for the price you really can't beat it.,53163,3
53163,If I were to buy it again I would definitely order a small.,53163,3
53164,"I'm 5'7"" an it barely covered my butt.",53164,3
53165,"Fits on top : chest area and waist- too much material on bottom- shorts too long and baggie
top fits like a maternity top.",53165,3
53166,I got these in burgundy yesterday and was really excited to wear them today.,53166,3
53166,"I think I have about a 27 inch waist/34 inch hips with a pretty fit built, and the size 5 fits great.",53166,3
53166,"They are soft, stretchy, and minus some stray threads at the seams (they're cheap, what do you expect) they look nice...but I've had them on for a few hours and have already had to lint roll them twice.",53166,3
53166,Whatever fabric this is just a magnet for lint...I can't imagine how terrible they will look after putting them in the laundry.,53166,3
53166,"They're so cheap that it would probably cost as much as the pants themselves to send them back, but these will not be the everyday pants I was hoping for.",53166,3
53167,"I thought it was great when I was just wearing jeans, but then I put on a pair of dress pants.",53167,3
53167,I can't button the button on my back pocket with this wallet.,53167,3
53167,"It's like 1/2"" too tall.",53167,3
53167,"I do love the thickness (or lack of thickness) and having everything in one place, but I hadn't seen anyone mention this in the reviews.",53167,3
53167,"If you wear jeans it's great, but anything with a button probably won't button anymore.",53167,3
53168,Bought for my son for Christmas.,53168,3
53168,"Fit great, BUT he wore it twice and the bottom button came off.",53168,3
53169,This is the second sweater this style I purchased but it is a little smaller/shorter than the other one I purchased.,53169,3
53169,"I am usually a size 12 and I bought a large, I probably could have gone with XL.",53169,3
53169,I also bought two of the V neck style and they fit perfectly.,53169,3
53169,I'm thinking it's a one off.,53169,3
53169,The color is darker than pictured.,53169,3
53169,"The sweater is well made and very, very soft which is why I bought several.",53169,3
53170,This hat was much floppier then I expected.,53170,3
53170,The bucket of the hat is also very round which I was not a fan of.,53170,3
53171,Not elastic so could not wrap around my wrist,53171,3
53172,Shirt ran small and material was very thin.,53172,3
53172,Would not purchase another one.,53172,3
53173,"This bottom was too small, too thin and too low.",53173,3
53173,I did not feel it provided enough coverage.,53173,3
53173,It also stopped at a weird point on the hip.,53173,3
53173,So it did nothing to accentuate my shape.,53173,3
53173,In the end I returned this bottom and the matching top.,53173,3
53174,"It is very pretty, but short in the back.",53174,3
53174,It is also more of a teal than emerald green.,53174,3
53175,Buy some dr shols because these things are very thin,53175,3
53176,Bigger than I expected from the reviews that I read.,53176,3
53177,This thing is way smaller than what it says.,53177,3
53178,Its more of an orange,53178,3
53179,Didn't last very long,53179,3
53180,always having to fix the flap on the back of the neck is annoying.they could have sewn it down.,53180,3
53181,Cute shirt they sent the next size up from what I ordered and it was a little too big but I am still keeping the shirt,53181,3
53183,I would suggest ordering 1 or 2 sizes up,53183,3
53184,I got this in black and gold and another that's gold and teal.,53184,3
53184,For some reason the gold and teal looks quality and the black and gold looks cheap.,53184,3
53184,The black also came wrinkled in a way I haven't been able to straighten out so it has kinks in it even when worn in addition to looking cheap.,53184,3
53184,"This one in particular is one I'd only actually use for ""costume jewelry.""",53184,3
53184,As in jewelry you actually wear with a costume or themed outfit or for a performance etc where there's no close contact and designed to be a little flashy but not extraordinary.,53184,3
53185,"If it suits your need, it's fine!",53185,3
53186,I didn't like the material it isn't very stretchy Very stiff not as comfortable as I'm used to.,53186,3
53187,Somewhat small for my chubby boy.,53187,3
53187,I think the style is also unflattering for boys also.,53187,3
53188,"I ordered 3 sizes larger but, it was to short in th torso.",53188,3
53188,I wouldn't recommend this for taller women.,53188,3
53189,It fit but the decorative part of neckline could nor decide if it was front or  back.,53189,3
53189,Neckline was very tight.,53189,3
53190,thought it would fit,53190,3
53192,"This is a great shirt, however it is short through the body.",53192,3
53193,I'm very disappointed with this bag.,53193,3
53193,It feels and smells like plastic.,53193,3
53193,Seller gave full refund.,53193,3
53194,"It's a very pretty watch and even came with an extra battery, however I'm very disappointed that there were no instructions.",53194,3
53194,"I can,t find a way to change the time of the watch and I nearly broke a nail and then scratched the casing trying to take off the baking to see if I could get to the battery compartment and if that was where the time is set.",53194,3
53195,"the white color is a bit see through, maybe good for the beach, but not for regular wear.",53195,3
53195,Liked that it had pockets,53195,3
53196,Cute shirt but the size is off by about 3 sizes.,53196,3
53197,"I got a size 4T, and it is just a little tight for my 3 year old around the waist.",53197,3
53197,It seems like it fits her just right.,53197,3
53197,I was hoping it would be a little loose so she could wear it longer but oh well what can I do.,53197,3
53198,There was a LOT of fake fur inside that it cut the shoe size down from what should fit my daughter to what was wayyyy too small.,53198,3
53198,We returned this item.,53198,3
53199,A lovely black dress that I had to suck in my breath for.,53199,3
53199,"I usually wear a medium, it looks pike a medium but fits like a small.",53199,3
53200,Nice for the price.,53200,3
53201,I ordered it 2 sizes bigger because it said that it ran small and it is still too small.,53201,3
53202,"Thin fabric, tight fit.",53202,3
53203,order a size up.,53203,3
53204,"Beautiful, but fits short for my height (5'7"")",53204,3
53205,Much too big for my baby,53205,3
53206,I loved the fit but didn't care for the material.,53206,3
53206,Its to shine for me.,53206,3
53206,"Besides that, its a nice shirt.",53206,3
53206,I didn't keep it because I just didn't like the material.,53206,3
53207,I usually buy swimwear a S size because I am a petite kind of girl.,53207,3
53207,But it surprised me when I had this in S size and I can't barely lock the upper portion.,53207,3
53207,The lower is just fine but the upper really so tight.,53207,3
53207,It has a very nice material/quality though.,53207,3
53207,I got this item from a discounted code in exchanged of my honest and unbiased review.,53207,3
53208,Lots of complements  lovely dress,53208,3
53209,Top was big under the arms and neck area.,53209,3
53211,This is very pretty on but very fagile and I m sure won't last long.,53211,3
53211,It will not stay in place.,53211,3
53211,My sister loved it and I am giving it to her.,53211,3
53211,"However, she is rough on jewelry and will not make it after first time wearing.",53211,3
53212,Too big - ordered women's size by mistake.,53212,3
53213,Comfortable to wear and they don't show through my leggings.,53213,3
53213,"But when I first opened the packet, one of the panties was already falling apart.",53213,3
53213,Be sure not to get the threads stuck on a zipper otherwise they will fall apart too.,53213,3
53214,Way too short/tight to wear at work.,53214,3
53214,The stockings would roll down and we're also too small/tight.,53214,3
53214,I got a medium and had to return it.,53214,3
53214,I'm 5'4 and 135lbs....,53214,3
53215,"too small, my fault.",53215,3
53216,"Gave it to my ""smaller"" sidter",53216,3
53217,I received this swimsuit yesterday in the mail.,53217,3
53217,It is very very cute but unfortunately the straps were defective and broke.,53217,3
53217,"There were no hooks on the end of them to strap onto the swimsuit and when I looked at the swimsuit, it had no place to strap them on anyway.",53217,3
53217,Only one was available in the front but the other 3 were missing which tells me this was probably a defective product and that's why it's on here so cheap.,53217,3
53217,Disappointed but I will order from another vendor with a similar suit that is a little more expensive.,53217,3
53217,"Also one other thing to keep in mind now that I have tried on the suit, the cut around the legs isn't very high.",53217,3
53217,"So if you are looking for higher cut, this suit unfortunately doesn't have that.",53217,3
53217,I felt it covered my backside well.,53217,3
53217,I am 5'5 and around 150 pounds with a muscular build.,53217,3
53217,Longer torso/shorter legs if that helps anyone.,53217,3
53218,1/2 sizes not available - order UP.,53218,3
53218,"Sandles were very nice - provided good arch support, quality product (just need to watch size when ordering)",53218,3
53220,this shirt was pretty cheap cost wise so didn't know what to expect.,53220,3
53220,"it was pretty color wise,  but it came with loose strings and very see through.",53220,3
53220,I was not happy but when contacted seller they got back to be every single time to help.,53220,3
53220,they gave me half a refund and I did not have to send it back.,53220,3
53220,I was pleased at least they gave me half my money back for a shirt I was not happy with and did not have the hassle of sending back.,53220,3
53220,it was a pleasure to get a seller who at least did what they could.,53220,3
53221,It's starting to change...I've had it for a couple of weeks and it's tarnishing...,53221,3
53222,"It is pretty cute with the frills on the sides and bows, but it does look cheaper than the pictures.",53222,3
53223,"These things always run small on the top for me, even though the measurements and size chart indicated the L would fit.",53223,3
53223,I should have known better.,53223,3
53223,It is not available in XL so I decided to take my chances on the L.,53223,3
53224,Runs a little small for bills,53224,3
53225,The handles are cracked and showing wear after only a few weeks of use.,53225,3
53226,Pants seemed like good quality but they were way too small for a Large.,53226,3
53226,"They were very tight, and I usually have plenty of room in size large.",53226,3
53227,Coming apart in front,53227,3
53228,i ordered a 12-18 months for my niece and it fit her huge... this outfit is not true to its size but it is very cute and we will be saving it for when it does fit.... My advise is to definitely order a smaller size way smaller....,53228,3
53229,will not wear well but looks good now,53229,3
53230,The dress is very stiff but still very pretty.,53230,3
53230,The sides at the bust are cut extremely low and the cups are really small.,53230,3
53230,If I can't have it altered I'll have to return it.,53230,3
53231,"Going to try sz up, really liked the print/color",53231,3
53232,"I have a lumpy butt and since gaining weight this dress shows it, it may be the stretchy material but it shows all lumps and bumps",53232,3
53233,It was a gift for my daughters friend.,53233,3
53233,She loves it and it fits great.,53233,3
53234,"very very cute dress, but very thin on the backside.",53234,3
53234,If you are comfortable with that go for it..,53234,3
53235,It looks and feels good but the large was way to small when other larges fit fine.,53235,3
53236,"I loved the look and price; however, it tore the first time I used it.",53236,3
53237,The chain...not so much,53237,3
53238,I wanted to use this after my pregnancy to hold my stomach in and straighten my back for breastfeeding.,53238,3
53238,I got it in an XS.,53238,3
53238,"I could barely get it on 2 days after baby, but even though it was tight my stomach was not flat.",53238,3
53238,"It doesn't really hold you in like a corset with strings, but it is great for posture.",53238,3
53238,Would not recommend it for breastfeeding moms however because the tank straps cut off my milk supply and made my girls hard as rocks for a couple days.,53238,3
53238,Might be good for people who want a more shapely waist under clothes or better posture.,53238,3
53239,"Comfy, bright colors, it's just kind of cheap and there is extra string hanging off the arms which can be hidden.",53239,3
53239,The sewing on it is pretty nice between the lace and the shirt.,53239,3
53239,It also got mailed pretty fast within two weeks.,53239,3
53241,As soon as I opened the package both necklaces were broke!,53241,3
53241,I was able to fix them tho,53241,3
53242,Nice bathing suit over all.,53242,3
53242,"Ordered an 18, bottoms are a bit snug if you got booty.",53242,3
53242,"The top could've been a size smaller and I'm a busty girl, I usually can't find a top big enough.",53242,3
53242,"Sadly, one of the straps was not sewed good enough, Didn't even have it on for 30 minutes and it came off, thank god this is a supportive top and it didn't expose my boob!!!",53242,3
53242,"I like the suit so I will just sew it back myself, very easy fix.",53242,3
53242,All in all it's ok for the price.,53242,3
53244,While I loved it in general.,53244,3
53244,"I gave it as a gift, and it looked really small for 9 months.",53244,3
53244,I don't know how much wear he will get out of it.,53244,3
53244,Still a good product only complaint is the sizing.,53244,3
53245,"I'm normally a large to xl, by reading the reviews I decided to go with a medium.",53245,3
53245,"It fits, and it will work.",53245,3
53245,I think I definitely could have got away with ordering a small.,53245,3
53245,It's a great outfit for the price.,53245,3
53245,"It's extremely stretchy which is nice and I haven't actually worn it out yet, concerned that it might permanently stretch out after a few wears.",53245,3
53246,i fit a small/medium and this was on the xsmall/small side.,53246,3
53246,i wish it was bigger.,53246,3
53246,the print i got came in perfect print.,53246,3
53246,"its made with some kind of latex plastic on the front, the sweater itself is soft but sleeves are more on the 3/4s side..it'lldef hold up in the washer and dryer if you fold inside out and warm water and low heat in dryer",53246,3
53247,But way too small!,53247,3
53248,I'm 185 pounds and a large was pretty snug.,53248,3
53249,It says high wast but it barely comes to my belly button.,53249,3
53249,They are small...I ordered one size up and wish I did 2 sizes up.,53249,3
53249,They are cute on and comfortable on the skin.,53249,3
53250,It got it today.,53250,3
53250,It is ok .,53250,3
53251,Poorer quality compared to Bundle Monster.,53251,3
53251,Fish and carrot fell after several uses.,53251,3
53251,Will not buy again.,53251,3
53252,"It's a little smaller than I thought, but it is useful",53252,3
53253,Somewhat baggy overall good product.,53253,3
53254,Good quality material but my first time wearing it the stitching from the silicone padding came undone on one corner.,53254,3
53254,"I am 5'0 about 145 pounds, size 6 I ordered s/m.",53254,3
53254,And you are a little blotted at first but I wished the fit would have been tighter at the incision area.,53254,3
53254,It is mostly tight at the waist band.,53254,3
53254,If it sticking wouldn't have come undone I probably would rate this 5 stars.,53254,3
53254,I was very careful when pulling up and down and making sure pad was over incision correctly.,53254,3
53254,Also wish the company would make more sizes.,53254,3
53254,XS S M L XL,53254,3
53255,Not as pictures fabric not feathers,53255,3
53256,"Didn't like the red, white, and blue stripes with the top oranges and turquoise.",53256,3
53258,"Nice for the money but not well made,flimsy",53258,3
53259,"Cute, but one of them broke the first time I wore it.",53259,3
53259,Cheap jewelry and cheaply made.,53259,3
53259,"I think I can fix it with pliers, but it's disappointing.",53259,3
53261,"This mast is mostly great, but I still see a little light coming through at the nose.",53261,3
53262,"Too small for me, gave them to my sister.",53262,3
53262,Took too long to get there.,53262,3
53263,I want to send back as they are way too big,53263,3
53264,"Fits larger then expected, material is cheap.",53264,3
53264,Have never worn it out.,53264,3
53265,Material is a bit thicker than I expected and thicker than the non-striped ties I bought from the same vendor.,53265,3
53265,OK for four-in-hand knots.,53265,3
53266,I wish i ordered a smaller size.,53266,3
53266,"I got the large since i have a very large bust, it fits okay.",53266,3
53266,"To big, no where near form fitting.",53266,3
53266,I guess i just got a new ved time shirt.,53266,3
53267,"This is an ok waist triner but it is not made well where its supposed to ""cinch"" in the lower rib.",53267,3
53267,I don't think much thought was put into the execution of this product.,53267,3
53267,"It folds really bad where the red arrows indicateds the ""cinching affect.",53267,3
53267,I mean I belivev I have been seeing results and I have been trying to wear it at least 8 hrs a day but sometimes it gets uncomfortable in the tighter areas .,53267,3
53267,I have been doing this for about 2 weeks.,53267,3
53267,"Its okay, but when I order another one I don't want it to do that weird tighter thing towards the middle..",53267,3
53268,the top fit way to big and my granddaughter wore it for 2 hours and the bow fell off and the butt area of the bottoms are all black where the shiny has already rubbed off.,53268,3
53270,Lasted in good shape a couple of days.,53270,3
53270,Band won't stay on.,53270,3
53271,"from the legs down they fit really well,but the inseam and seat is way too short.",53271,3
53271,"i am 5'5 ,short waisted and pretty small butt,the waistband sits very low under the beltline so even just normal walking the back of the waistband is about halfway down your crack by the time you get across the room.",53271,3
53271,Since the rest of the long johns fit fine i think going up to the next size would make them fit too big.,53271,3
53271,But these were very inexpensive so i guess i will live with it.,53271,3
53272,"With asian sizing I usually go up 2 sizes, but this shirt is not as small as most brands!!",53272,3
53272,"I am a large/XL, so I ordered 3x to be on the safe side, but it it ridiculously oversized.",53272,3
53272,I probably could have ordered XL.,53272,3
53272,"The fabric is nice, and it's not as see thru as most of these ""chiffon"" type shirts.",53272,3
53272,I took stars off for the arms being crazy baggy (I could probably fit my LEG in the sleeve...) and the cuffed sleeve attaches with D-rings rather than a button.,53272,3
53272,"I think it makes the shirt look cheap, plus there is extra length of the little strap hanging once you cuff the sleeves.",53272,3
53272,"Plus if you don't have the sleeve cuffed the D-rings look dumb and make clinking noises, sort of like bangle bracelets.",53272,3
53272,"At $12 I probably would have kept the shirt, but it's just WAY too big.",53272,3
53273,Love the shirt but a little bigger than expected.,53273,3
53274,The bottoms fit really weird,53274,3
53275,It is a nice scarf.,53275,3
53275,But I received the black with tan polka dots instead of the navy as requested.,53275,3
53277,Very thin fabric and it fitted too tightly for my liking.,53277,3
53277,The description says it's a loose top... well not quite!,53277,3
53277,"XL usually fits loosely on me, but not this one.",53277,3
53277,"I like the color combination, but that's about it.",53277,3
53278,Love the shirt but runs alil small.,53278,3
53278,Got it a size bigger but still was alil snug on my arms.,53278,3
53278,I like the style and still wore it out for my girls night out,53278,3
53279,I like these glasses.,53279,3
53279,Lenses are a good color and protect eyes from the sun without too much dimming.,53279,3
53279,"However, the paint is coming off and leaves black marks on my face after I wear them.",53279,3
53280,"It fit okay, Im; 5'1 unusually wear medium to large shirts size 10 pants and the length of the jacket is perfect, its a bit tight around the shoulders and back but thats with a slim layered hoodie underneath.",53280,3
53280,the only thing that really bugs me is how small the hood is,53280,3
53281,"they had a little bit of an odor, so washed on the hand delicate cycle, but more than half of the gems on the blue part of dress came off so the pattern was messed up.",53281,3
53282,Its a but big,53282,3
53283,The bag is what I was expecting except it smells awful inside!,53283,3
53283,I've had it open airing out all week in hopes the smell will go away and not return.,53283,3
53283,I'm not happy about this!,53283,3
53283,But I'm  going to give it a chance because I like the looks and size of the bag.,53283,3
53284,"It's a cute bathing suit, only problem I have is I have thick thighs so the leg holes were to small and tight around my legs.",53284,3
53285,This isn't the style/design for me.,53285,3
53285,"It's too 'grandma-like'  I thought it might be cuter and younger appearing due to other reviews, but it's not.",53285,3
53285,I prefer the tie-dyed versions through other sellers.,53285,3
53285,"The material is different as well, not the stretchy T-shirt style that I also prefer but a more still and less flowing version.",53285,3
53285,"I suppose if I were anorexic it might look good, but for fuller endowed women like me, it looks like an old lady's top.",53285,3
53285,"I doubt if I'll wear it, but I might give it to my mother-in-law or someone older that it might fit and they might like it.",53285,3
53285,"I'm 61, and it still looks old on me, so unless you're really young and don't care about how you 'appear' in age and you are somewhat 'big' in size (it does make me slender) then it's not a very flattering look on middle-age women.",53285,3
53285,The colors are really bright too.,53285,3
53285,"But yeah, it's totally not what I expected on me.",53285,3
53286,"Love the picture on the purse, the bag not so much.",53286,3
53286,"It was way too small, my wallet would not even fit in without having to shove it it.",53286,3
53286,The zipper was not very smooth.,53286,3
53286,I can only use this for outings when I don't want a bigger bag.,53286,3
53286,It is cute but not for me.,53286,3
53287,"Love it, just too small for me.",53287,3
53288,I ordered this for my son bday and he really loves it it looks kinda of faded but it goes with the style.,53288,3
53289,I had to adjust the band that goes around my neck,53289,3
53290,I am normally a size 9-10.,53290,3
53290,I seen the site say it runs over 50% to large.,53290,3
53290,So I ordered a 12.,53290,3
53290,It was okay beside right around the belly.,53290,3
53290,So if you order the dress remember that.,53290,3
53290,Also it's not the same dress.,53290,3
53291,"Don't like the polyester, looks cheap, cotton looks nicer.",53291,3
53292,I usually wear a 2XL but this was more like a small XL.,53292,3
53293,It fits tight and is a little short but looks sexy,53293,3
53294,They look good and have descent frames but not good for real eye protection,53294,3
53295,Beautiful but doesn't fit as expected,53295,3
53296,3 stars because price is high (I remember getting these in the 50 cent machines at cici's as a kid).,53296,3
53296,But I want to give 5 stars because they are identical to those I'd get as a kid.,53296,3
53297,"I bought the black and white bodycon 2 piece, I kept the white one, but wish I had just returned it.",53297,3
53297,It is very see through.,53297,3
53298,somewhat large but great quality.,53298,3
53299,I ordered this vest and it met my satisfaction.,53299,3
53299,Also the price was right.,53299,3
53299,Along with this vest and to my surprise was another vest a black one.,53299,3
53299,That delighted me until I tried it on.,53299,3
53299,"Even though it's labeled as XXL, it's more like XXXS.",53299,3
53299,It wouldn't child over seven years of age.,53299,3
53299,Not sure what to think of this.,53299,3
53299,In truth it was a worthless freebie,53299,3
53300,"I like it, but came with a hole in the pocket.",53300,3
53300,I won't be returning it because I can sew.,53300,3
53301,"It's very lightweight, shoe is very snug.",53301,3
53301,I would suggest you buy a size bigger especially with winter socks on.,53301,3
53302,mine was too small.,53302,3
53302,I never saw the sizes listed and went with a Large for  a 7 1/4 head.,53302,3
53302,returned it for another XL which then fit (barely),53302,3
53304,I raise my arms and it completely uncovers my bum.,53304,3
53304,Should have gone up 3 sizes in order for it to fit correctly as a dress.,53304,3
53304,Decided to keep it and use it as a swimsuit cover-up.,53304,3
53305,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this dress is stupidly tailored on the bottom.",53305,3
53305,It flares out in a silly way that looks completely beastly.,53305,3
53305,"I sew, so I was able to alter it to a more normal shape and cut off the 8"" of trianglular fabric at  the bottom from each side.",53305,3
53305,"I'm 5'1"" and about 125 lbs, 34C and ordered a LARGE based on others' reviews.",53305,3
53305,"Still too short to wear as a dress, but I had planned to wear it as a tunic anyway.",53305,3
53305,"The fabric is nice and thick, stretchy- like the old Old Navy perfect fit T's used to be before they cut the thread count in half!",53305,3
53306,You get what you pay for comes to mind with this item.,53306,3
53306,It's good for my daughter to play in.,53306,3
53306,It didn't look like the picture.,53306,3
53307,"Material not as good as Samfe which I got last time, not as thick.",53307,3
53307,I really need longer ones.,53307,3
53308,Transfer quality was bad - could not see the picture at all.,53308,3
53308,Shirt quality was good.,53308,3
53309,I don't see them lasting a year but that's I guess it's what I paid for.,53309,3
53309,UPDATED 2/21/17 I've had the shoes for 5 months now and the point is about bent over and a decent amount of wear and tear.,53309,3
53309,They have lasted me this long ear about 2-3 times a week for the past 5 months.,53309,3
53309,Color is extremely faded from the blue.,53309,3
53310,small for an XL,53310,3
53311,I'm 5'2 120 n 38 D .,53311,3
53311,I ordered a large but should of got a XL.,53311,3
53312,"Very cheaply made, but will hold up for a night out!",53312,3
53312,I ordered a size up after reading reviews and it's too big.,53312,3
53312,It looks sloppy on due to the size.,53312,3
53312,"I considered exchanging, but the sequins were sooo rough on my underarms!",53312,3
53312,I'll be returning this items.,53312,3
53312,If you love it and like the fit it's okay!,53312,3
53313,Buy a larger size then what you really are.,53313,3
53314,Not as nice as it looks.,53314,3
53315,This is a lightweight fashion piece.,53315,3
53315,It kinks up easily and it is long.,53315,3
53315,I would not recommend this for someone with a short neck.,53315,3
53316,Fits me as I hoped.,53316,3
53316,"Fabric has a little cheaper feel to it, the picture made it look thick, almost like a sweatshirt.",53316,3
53316,Collects fuzzies from the scarf I wore with it.,53316,3
53316,"It has pockets, huge bonus.",53316,3
53317,"Kind of cheap feeling, but I wear it around the house.",53317,3
53319,This made a great gift but didn't last long.,53319,3
53319,Bought this and matching 'I Love You' ring as a couples present and this one lasted a whole month before it could no longer be worn.,53319,3
53319,"I did not wear mine often, mostly due to me forgetting to put it on, but this one I gave to my boyfriend.",53319,3
53319,WIthin two weeks the emblem on the inside had lost all of the black and it later made my boyfriend's finger start to blister around the band area.,53319,3
53320,I love the bottoms but the top is way too small for the large bottom that i got.,53320,3
53320,Unless u are smaller on top and bigger on the bottom then only buy this with the intention of only using the bottoms,53320,3
53321,"Despite its size is smaller than I expected, I like it very much.",53321,3
53322,"Works fine, but really expected 2, is this for 1 handed children who lose mittens?",53322,3
53322,"My fault for not reading the description correctly, I suppose.",53322,3
53324,The 1st one I ordered was too small.,53324,3
53324,The second one is better fitting but the quality control was bad.,53324,3
53324,On the side the front and back fabric was misaligned when sewed so there is a hole.,53324,3
53324,Instead of returning and paying fir shipping a 3rd time I decided to take it to a professional to have it fixed.,53324,3
53324,Other then that the swim suite is very nice.,53324,3
53324,I usually wear a size 7 but in the end I had to get a 12 due to their sizing runs really small.,53324,3
53325,"I usually wear size 6 in shorts or dresses (I'm 5'7"" and weigh 130) and although the waist band does stretchable bit, they just barely fit.",53325,3
53325,"Plus the material is soft and comfy but they did fit kinda like spandex, so clingy that they did not look good/appropriate unless you like the biker shorts style.",53325,3
53325,The way they stuck to me in the behind yet were droopy in the front due to the pockets was not flattering.,53325,3
53325,Too bad- seems like they had potential and I did like the prints.,53325,3
53325,Would perhaps look good on a flat booty and small/petite very slender frame.,53325,3
53326,I was really surprised at how well this fit and looked on me.,53326,3
53326,I got tons of compliments on it and for the first half of the day LOVED this shirt.,53326,3
53326,But I noticed in the afternoon that BOTH seams where the back/yolk area meet the sleeves near the ruffles had torn away.,53326,3
53326,Now this shirt was loose on my and fit very comfortably.,53326,3
53326,I wasn't doing any crazy 'fat guy in a little coat' dances either.,53326,3
53326,I sat at a desk all day and some how hulked out the sleeves/back of the shirt.,53326,3
53326,"I sew so I can reinforce and fix this, but a huge bummer for something that really only lasted a few hours.",53326,3
53326,I'm only fixing it because I got so many compliments on it.,53326,3
53326,I'm 6ft 165lbs normally where a M and ordered an XL for this.,53326,3
53327,The wrist band was to long however.,53327,3
53327,With some adjustment it will be a great watch.,53327,3
53328,I need either an XL slim or a Reg L. Please provide RMA info so I can return the shirt and get the right size,53328,3
53329,Bargain price for two-piece suit.,53329,3
53329,Trouser fit perfectly but Jacket is little large for me but still wearable.,53329,3
53330,"Pretty shirt, fit is as expected.",53330,3
53330,It's however a little short and rather wide.,53330,3
53330,I wish it were longer.,53330,3
53330,Also again a little wide.,53330,3
53330,"But, still a cute shirt not bad for the price.",53330,3
53331,For the price it's cute.,53331,3
53331,Lots of room you can tell its cheap but it does its purpose.,53331,3
53331,I am not one to spend lots of money on purses so it's perfect for me.,53331,3
53331,But the quality is cheap.,53331,3
53331,So giving it a 3 but like the saYing goes what you pay is what you get but it did come right on time,53331,3
53332,Nice- but very small- hard to read engraving.,53332,3
53333,Cheaply made & won't last long but cute.,53333,3
53333,Can't fit many cards in it or else the button doesn't stay closed.,53333,3
53334,"Bought this for a gift, pretty cheaply made but the product was cheap.",53334,3
53335,Easy to bend but my mom loves them,53335,3
53336,I bought 4 of these tops mainly for the loose fit and price.,53336,3
53336,"However, these run super big and most are one size fits all.",53336,3
53336,I didn't return the tops returning would cost more than they cost.,53336,3
53336,I will try to sew them to a more desired fit.,53336,3
53336,I'm a lot bigger than the model and I still could fit another person in there.,53336,3
53336,Picture is very deceiving.,53336,3
53337,"ordered a medium thinking it would fit and its to big
the neckline isn't low but a pretty color not grey",53337,3
53338,i like this dress its very flowy and roomy but it run pretty short on me.,53338,3
53338,Im 5'6 and it was mech shorter than expected,53338,3
53339,I've had good luck with some of the other 90 Degree yoga pants.,53339,3
53339,"However, I only wore the Emerald Green pair once and washed them once before a seam came out.",53339,3
53339,Now there is a hole right in the back.,53339,3
53339,"Unfortunately, this was after the 30 day return window, so I'm stuck with them.",53339,3
53341,didnt like the side zipper placement was awkward,53341,3
53342,Just did not meet my needs.,53342,3
53343,"For the price, it's decent quality.",53343,3
53343,"I like the design of the wallet, it holds a lot.",53343,3
53343,"Not so sure how true it is that it's real leather, but it feels nice either way.",53343,3
53343,"The wallet I received is as pictured, color is bright,  however it did not come with the cute little tassel.",53343,3
53343,"I'm also kind of annoyed that the zipper doesn't stay closed very well, it likes to unzip itself about 1""-1.5"", hoping that doesn't cause some of my belongings to fall out.",53343,3
53343,"I also wish the card slots were designed a little better, the back slots swallow the cards  I put in them, they're way too deep.",53343,3
53343,"Other than that, so far I'm pretty happy with my purchase, although there could be a few design changes.",53343,3
53343,"I'll continue to use it, pretty sure it'll do it's job.",53343,3
53344,The dress VERY short and also very see through.,53344,3
53344,I wear a slip under it tho and it doesn't bother me.,53344,3
53344,"I ordered a M and wish I got a L. I am 130 5'5"" and M was too short.",53344,3
53345,"They are pretty, and nice.",53345,3
53345,The biggest gripe is they are very rough and sharp on the edges.,53345,3
53345,They weren't polished smoothly.,53345,3
53346,"Love the text, but the fabric is rather thin and the sizing runs a bit on the small size.",53346,3
53347,ok item and are really cute but the eventually they get all bleck,53347,3
53348,"I do love the space and pockets in this bag, but I didn't read the label very well-Nylon...i hate the nylon material.",53348,3
53348,But the pockets and space are wonderful.,53348,3
53349,Not very well made.,53349,3
53351,Has an odd smell to it that I can't get rid of but is very soft and snuggly!,53351,3
53351,"A little ""short"", not as comfy/slouchy-looking as the picture.",53351,3
53352,Had a big hole between legs...,53352,3
53353,"Short in the front, not long enough to wear as a dress.",53353,3
53353,Ended up wearing as a shirt with leggings.,53353,3
53354,I wear around size 1-3 pants size.,53354,3
53354,I ordered a large and thank god I did.,53354,3
53354,"It fits literally like a glove, leaving no space.",53354,3
53354,It fits kind of like underwear.,53354,3
53354,My butt cheeks hang out..(like a good amount of my buttcheeks..like 2 inch of buttcheeks shows) I'm not quite sure where to wear these now...perhaps the beach?,53354,3
53354,They are VERY low cut.,53354,3
53354,One side of the zipper has a defect because it was sewn on backwards...thats weird..DON'T unzip the zippers because i tried and the zipper separated the opposite way and i had to try to fit it back..it sucks.,53354,3
53354,The quality is kinda sh*t. hahah I don't know how many time I can wear it before it just comes apart.,53354,3
53354,It smells a bit weird.,53354,3
53354,I mean they don't look too bad ...i'll just wear them on those rare occasions of when my inner slut comes out to play.,53354,3
53354,">;) lol

I hope my review helps.",53354,3
53355,"Cute, but I've ordered this hat twice because the material is so cheap.",53355,3
53355,Both times it came somewhat f--ed up right out of the box because I guess that shipping a hat is a challenge ?,53355,3
53355,I usually get a few wears out of it  before it starts to look rough- then I toss it in the thrift store pile.,53355,3
53356,"Wouldn't buy again, you get what you pay for and the shirt is shorter than advertised and more sheer.",53356,3
53356,"Plus, the fabric isn't forgiving and it WILL show the shape of your bra underneath, you almost HAVE to wear it without a bra, but wear those nipple covers so your nips aren't saying ""hi"" to the world (unless you're into that of course).",53356,3
53357,Top and bottom beads do not stay in place and slide around.,53357,3
53358,Love the bracelet but very hard to put it yourself to close it.,53358,3
53359,Well right by the shoulders it's kinda small,53359,3
53361,"Fit nice, felt alright, but it was a half-size too big (I used a true jeweler's measuring method).",53361,3
53361,"Luckily, it wasn't for anything important.",53361,3
53362,"In spite of sizing chart, still too small.",53362,3
53363,It's cute light weight shirt stretchy feel,53363,3
53364,"Fit fine in the waist and I think it would work for several sizes, there is quite a bit of material and stretch at the top.",53364,3
53364,"I'm 5'6"" and about 145, size 6-8 dress and could have been a bit smaller or quite a bit larger.",53364,3
53364,But it just didn't work under my wedding dress as the hoops were too large.,53364,3
53364,"As others did, I tried to cut out the bottom hoop (there are 3) but I could still see the outline where the hoops were and it just didn't quite sit right.",53364,3
53364,"This would work well for a costume or a dress with a very large base, more than a mermaid or trumpet style dress, and where the fabric and layers were thick enough to obscure the metal hoop outlines.",53364,3
53365,Can be difficult on very tight case backs.,53365,3
53366,"Nice hat, good value.",53366,3
53367,They were nice but received them a day later than initially informed.,53367,3
53367,Needed them for a special event and getting them later made it more challenging for people to coordinate other accessories with them.,53367,3
53367,Ordered them online because this is prom weekend and local stores were sold out.,53367,3
53367,"Other than that, they looked nice.",53367,3
53368,Runs big and the length is short.,53368,3
53368,Not good for tall people unless you like high waters.,53368,3
53368,They are cute pants well more like jeggings.,53368,3
53369,Not bad for the price......it's smaller than I thought.,53369,3
53370,"I really love the design of this shirt, but it runs REEEAAALLLLY small.",53370,3
53370,An XL is like a medium.,53370,3
53370,Just know that before you order.,53370,3
53370,"Unless you are tiny, it's not going to have an oversized look like it appears on the model.",53370,3
53370,But the lace is pretty and the design is unique.,53370,3
53371,In this first week of using these my mom had a lens fall out and we can't find it...otherwise she loves them and the fact that they came with there own case.,53371,3
53372,Be aware that these are more like tights than leggings and are extremely see-through.,53372,3
53372,"Ther than that, they are a cute, great product.",53372,3
53373,"I'm not sure if it lists itself as a junior fit anywhere, but this fits smaller than a normal medium.",53373,3
53373,"After putting it on my first time I could already see some permanent stretching in the elastic, so it's pretty poor quality elastic, and my 34DD chest is a bit much for it.",53373,3
53373,"It's still really cute and looks good on, I don't see much in the way of bulging, I just don't like that the elastic did a poor job of retaining it's elasticity.",53373,3
53374,These are super stylish sandals but they aren't made well.,53374,3
53374,They also were a bit large for her size.,53374,3
53374,The material scratches my daughter's ankles causing her to bleed.,53374,3
53374,I placed some moleskin on the inside of the sandals to keep the rough edges from rubbing against her skin.,53374,3
53375,"Not assorted, a exactly the same.",53375,3
53376,Fit okay just a little to short for my liking but over all ok,53376,3
53377,"Charm is very nice, but the chain broke the day I got it.",53377,3
53378,I ordered my normal size in this brand but it was too tight through the bust.,53378,3
53379,Cut like a square and doesn't hang as long as I like.,53379,3
53379,"If you're shorter than 5'4"" it probably is long enough but not for anyone taller than 5'6"" as I am.",53379,3
53380,The shirt wasn't what I expected but cute anyway.,53380,3
53380,My daughter has to wear a tank top under it because the fabric is so thin you can see through it!,53380,3
53381,Not that bad but recommend getting a latex waist trainer.,53381,3
53381,But this is good for the price paid .,53381,3
53382,"If your goal is to increase airflow and reduce binding below your waist, these are probably pretty good.",53382,3
53382,"If your goal is to avoid thigh rubbing under skirts, maybe try something else.",53382,3
53382,"My thighs really, really like each other and these bloomers were not enough to keep them apart.",53382,3
53382,It's possible that they were too short in the leg for me and would work better on a shorter lady.,53382,3
53382,They also fit very loosely (oddly) around the waist and hips.,53382,3
53382,They weren't uncomfortable but they definitely don't have the snug fit you usually associate with undergarments.,53382,3
53382,I probably wouldn't get them again but I can see how they might be comfortable for someone else.,53382,3
53383,"Maybe i'm just getting fat, or these pant slightly shrunk while being shipped.",53383,3
53383,"Regardless, these shorts are quite snug around my large packaging.",53383,3
53384,"The large size is small size
The x large size is medium",53384,3
53385,I like the shirt itself.,53385,3
53385,But the sleeves are too short and it's a bit too long in the torso area.,53385,3
53386,Beautiful but too small by the bust area.,53386,3
53386,I bought it to keep it on the closets or fit some friend without breast.,53386,3
53387,"I was looking for a trendy camo shirt, i.e.",53387,3
53387,not the hunting camo.,53387,3
53387,This looked to be perfect but isn't printed well.,53387,3
53387,The lighter colors are hardly visible on the shirt which makes it look more like a zebra print than camo.,53387,3
53387,I can't recommend this if you're looking for camo..,53387,3
53388,Didn't fit as expected but I like it,53388,3
53389,Cute but basic plastic spirals.,53389,3
53389,They go well with a white t shirt or blouse.,53389,3
53389,They are the correct size some are larger than advertized but these are correct.,53389,3
53390,"I haven't tried this on my 10 month old son yet, but it appears to be a true fit, so there's that.",53390,3
53390,"And I love the pattern, very different.",53390,3
53390,"HOWEVER...the description says ""cotton blend"" and if you view the tag in the picture, it says 100% cotton.",53390,3
53390,"It's bathing suit material, so some sort of lycra/spandex material.",53390,3
53390,"It was very inexpensive, so I knew going in there was a chance I wouldn't get what I was expecting, so not terribly disappointed, but be aware that it's not a soft cotton as the tag/details would make you think.",53390,3
53390,"It's basically a full body bathing suit for a baby, which isn't altogether a bad thing.",53390,3
53390,"I think I'll use this not as a traditional outfit but as my son's pool outfit, as this will cover him more against the son, so it's not a complete loss.",53390,3
53391,Would have been great if it fit.,53391,3
53391,"I'm 5'6"" and 150 lbs and I got the large.",53391,3
53391,It fit around me but not the length of me.,53391,3
53392,Great product just wished that I got a little more lift.,53392,3
53392,"If i had of went down one more size the lift would have been amazing I bet, but the thigh opening would have been way.... too tight, because the one I have now fits tight but not uncomfortably tight though.",53392,3
53392,You will have no problems throughout the day.,53392,3
53392,The tummy control comes all the way under my bust and under armpits so that's great.,53392,3
53393,daughter is obsessed with this because it is batman,53393,3
53394,Worked out fine for Halloween.,53394,3
53394,Didn't like how the shirt and jacket were attached.,53394,3
53394,I liked that the shorts were covering.,53394,3
53394,But the belt was too small.,53394,3
53394,It would barely Velcro over my hips,53394,3
53395,"I love this elephant charm, however I wish it was smaller.",53395,3
53395,The size of the charm makes it look cheap.,53395,3
53395,A smaller version would look classy.,53395,3
53396,I was searching 2 days on every clothing site to fine the perfect coat.,53396,3
53396,"I finally found it, what a beautiful coat, it feels heavy in weight, feels like it will keep you warm but.... it runs small.",53396,3
53396,I'm normally a size XL so I decided to go 1X it fits like a small XL.,53396,3
53396,I say go 2 sizes up from your normal size for this coat.,53396,3
53396,"Shoulders and arms were uncomfortable, chest area was bulging.",53396,3
53396,I'm still keeping the coat.,53396,3
53396,"I'm already losing weight already so, I should fit comfortable in it soon.",53396,3
53397,Pretty but starting to rust,53397,3
53398,"Arrived quickly, packaged well.",53398,3
53398,"It's worth the fabric, not finished on sides only the ends.",53398,3
53398,"Would not purchase again, it was cheap so  I'll keep it but I doubt I'll use it.",53398,3
53399,Ordered an XL but it fits more like a Medium.,53399,3
53399,It still might work but we may have to return it.,53399,3
53399,I would say order 2 sizes up from your normal size.,53399,3
53400,Comfortable fit and works like any other pair of sunglasses.,53400,3
53400,I like the look of them when wearing.,53400,3
53401,"Love the shirts, but way too small for a medium size as listed.",53401,3
53402,"We did order larger, per the reviews and instructions but this was STILL too small for my husband.",53402,3
53402,"We ended up re-gifting it to my nephew who is a lanky 10 year old, and it fit him fine.",53402,3
53403,Large and had multiple compartments but the shoulder straps continuously get unhooked because of the cheap clips just like one of the other reviews stated.,53403,3
53404,"I am giving it 3 stars because the quality is good, but is is way bigger than it looks in the picture.",53404,3
53404,I wanted a purse to match my wallet I have with the same pattern.,53404,3
53404,It is the size of a freaking luggage carry on tote.,53404,3
53404,"I like big purses, but it is way too big to use for a purse.",53404,3
53405,"I didn't receive the promised certification, so I'm not positive it's authentic.",53405,3
53405,Huge price difference in the real and fake ones.,53405,3
53405,I think it's the real thing but would've liked the Komen certificate.,53405,3
53406,You need to enlarge your panties for larger women with much higher waist,53406,3
53407,My daughter needed this costume for a princess run.,53407,3
53407,It was worth the price paid.,53407,3
53407,It looks really cute on.,53407,3
53407,True fit x-small size 2-4.,53407,3
53407,The material on top is thin.,53407,3
53407,The zipper is flimsy..very 'iffy' when zipping up/down.,53407,3
53408,The picture is very nice but this shirt is super thin and very see through.,53408,3
53408,The sleeve part is awkward and doesn't sit right.,53408,3
53408,It took my daughter an hour to figure out how it was supposed to be worn.,53408,3
53409,"Looks & fits way cheaper than pictured, I gave this dress away.",53409,3
53410,My great niece is only 2 weeks old so I figured she'd be 7 to 9mos before she could wear it.,53410,3
53410,Bought the 12 month since reviews said it ran a little small.,53410,3
53410,Really cute but looks more 3 month size.,53410,3
53410,We'll know for sure come summer.,53410,3
53411,Liked the way it looked but when I received it the clasp does not stay closed.,53411,3
53411,I would not recommend this necklace,53411,3
53412,Some of the coloring is off.,53412,3
53413,"I love the looks of this bag, but when some of the reviews mention the terrible smell....",53413,3
53413,They are spot on!!,53413,3
53413,"It smells terrible, almost like dog food.",53413,3
53413,And I have carried this for over a week now and the smell has barely dissipated.,53413,3
53414,its not that bad need work tho,53414,3
53415,There isn't anything around the bottom of the top to help keep it in place & not ride up.,53415,3
53415,"I can ""fix"" that.... otherwise, it's cute.",53415,3
53416,"Fabric looks a little cheap, but sturdy.",53416,3
53416,I like the overall color.,53416,3
53416,Looks like the teal in the picture.,53416,3
53416,The only problem I would find is that it came broken.,53416,3
53416,One of the straps wasn't attached which is a not disappointing but fixable.,53416,3
53416,The zipper you have to be gentle with.,53416,3
53416,I love the zipper charm.,53416,3
53417,size small was perfect,53417,3
53418,Not the best printing I have seen on a sweat shirt.,53418,3
53418,The red sweatshirt shows thru the white design.,53418,3
53418,"The description says SWEATER,  BUT IT IS A SWEATSHIRT......",53418,3
53419,Definitely order larger size.,53419,3
53420,"Very cute, but covers too much with the bottom.",53420,3
53420,"Kinda of stinks, because it is so cute.",53420,3
53421,Was smaller than I expected even ordered large size.,53421,3
53422,This playsuit is very chic and cute.,53422,3
53422,Fits perfectly (I am 5'1 ft 32B).,53422,3
53422,"It looks a little like lingerie due to the satin material, but I could not care less how others think of it as long as I love it, and I did.",53422,3
53422,I paired it with a pair of nude kitten heels and it was perfect.,53422,3
53422,What could be better?,53422,3
53422,I wished the opening V-neck was more opened.,53422,3
53422,"Often times I found it closing in, however I did use body tape which helped some what.",53422,3
53422,"The sleeves come in a style that it's a little opened and loose, where you have floppy sleeves.",53422,3
53422,"I would have given it a 4 star rating, but I feel like the above would have really made a different feel in comfort and looks if it was tailored a bit.",53422,3
53423,"It's bigger then I thought it runs size up I order size 4/6 that's medium but I received a large,it's still a nice outfit.",53423,3
53424,"This dress is super scratchy, the slit fit awkward and it was very large.",53424,3
53424,The color and design was nice but I wouldn't buy it again.,53424,3
53425,"Quality is not that great, but you get what you pay for.",53425,3
53425,Classy and casual looking dress.,53425,3
53428,The large size was kinda tight on the cuffs.,53428,3
53428,Might have to order the next size up.,53428,3
53429,I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this.,53429,3
53429,"Lol
I am more conservative than I've ever been..",53429,3
53429,"I think I was trying to prove to myself that I'm still young maybe lol
Anyway I ordered it in the largest size available.. an xl.",53429,3
53429,It arrived quickly and cost was fair.,53429,3
53429,I tried it on and I'm still unsure.,53429,3
53429,It's not small like around the waist or chest area.. but it is short in length: like the torso part should be made longer.,53429,3
53429,It rides up in the front and I don't have a long torso by any means...,53429,3
53429,I feel like anyone taller than 5'4 would have an issue with it riding up in the front.. maybe a sarong or something along those lines would help.,53429,3
53429,I doubt I'd ever feel comfortable wearing this on front of anyone other than my other half as it is.. but it's kind of a shame because if it was just a teensiest bit longer I'd be happy to give it 4-5 stars,53429,3
53430,"The material was okay, for the price it was expected not to be that great.",53430,3
53430,I wore it for several hours and it didn't make me uncomfortable.,53430,3
53430,It looks great with any color suit beneath.,53430,3
53430,My issue is that the shoulder holes were very small.,53430,3
53430,It did not look as pictured!,53430,3
53430,"Also, in the photo it seems that it would be somewhat of an oversized fit, and it was not.",53430,3
53431,I really like the color of the lens.,53431,3
53431,The frame feels cheap though.,53431,3
53431,Feel like it was overpriced.,53431,3
53432,"Pretty, but I don't love it.",53432,3
53432,"Got a large based on reviews, but I think a medium might have fit.",53432,3
53432,"I'm 5'7 150 lbs, with 36D size chest.",53432,3
53434,This item didn't fit as expected.,53434,3
53434,I should have ordered two sizes larger.,53434,3
53436,As a set this was too showy for me.,53436,3
53436,I wear them separately.,53436,3
53437,The socks look great but material is not as expected when i put them on and they fit large.,53437,3
53437,I have a size 7.5 and they are very loose.,53437,3
53438,"Runs very small, and is not nearly as nice as Columbia's ""Silver Ridge"" outdoor shirt.",53438,3
53438,Order a size larger than what you ordinarily wear would be my recommendation.,53438,3
53439,Short in arms and body,53439,3
53440,I ordered the skirt according to the size chart in the product description (which I had found to be accurate in prior purchases from the same company).,53440,3
53440,This time the size chart in the product description was not accurate and the skirt was too big in the waist.,53440,3
53440,I would have to have it taken in a few inches in order for me to wear it higher on the waist the way it's meant to be.,53440,3
53440,"On the positive side, it's a nice shade of blue and I like that it has pockets.",53440,3
53441,This was our second order for this shirt because the medium was way too small.,53441,3
53441,I ordered a large & it's still way too small.,53441,3
53441,We were super bummed.,53441,3
53442,"this is the second time I buy this item, the first time I realized that the screws are not titanium and these were broken",53442,3
53443,Be aware...your child will have trouble to put them on.,53443,3
53445,The color is not quite bright as the picture,53445,3
53447,"The PRO's:
-dripping in sequins, front AND back
-nice color and pretty dress overall
-great price
The CON's:
-Large is more like a Medium.",53447,3
53447,"I'm 5'7, 170 pounds, 34 waist, 38 DD and the large was barely fitting, too tight
-Way too short in the back, it shows the tush without even bending -maybe cuz it's too small overall, although it fits well on hips
-Stiff and itchy at the edges because of the sequins
-Doesn't stretch much, if at all
I'm still pondering whether to keep it (to wear after I lose 10 pounds), gift it, or send it back.",53447,3
53447,"For 14 bucks..I dunno, I might keep it and see how it fits in a few months, shed some pounds meanwhile, for the summer season.",53447,3
53448,My niece looves it!!,53448,3
53448,"But, one of the ties to the back came off the first time she wore it.",53448,3
53448,"So, not made the best, but worth 16$ to make a little girl very happy.",53448,3
53450,This swimsuit is cute and fit as expected.,53450,3
53450,The only problem I had with it was the straps-- they pop off all the time.,53450,3
53450,I found that really annoying.,53450,3
53451,Nice fit in torso and chest but tight in the arms.,53451,3
53451,FYI: if you have musclular arms this is not the shirt for you.,53451,3
53451,I am of average/athletic built and the sleeves are so tight,53451,3
53453,I was hoping it'd be smaller.,53453,3
53453,But it looks great.,53453,3
53454,The opening could be a little bigger but other then that the look cute and fit well,53454,3
53455,Fitting Not good at the wrist.,53455,3
53456,Cute but was pretty large and constructelopsided lopsided.,53456,3
53456,It came out of the box pretty smashed.,53456,3
53456,Reshapes pretty well but was still lopsided.,53456,3
53456,Front point of hat faces to the corner even after reshaping.,53456,3
53457,They are cheaply looking.,53457,3
53457,"It is hard to tell how protective they are,
Moneywise $4 is OK, if that matters.",53457,3
53458,"cute skirt but sizing was off, way smaller than size chart showed.",53458,3
53459,"My daughter wears size 18m, and since the majority of reviews seemed to agree that this runs true to size or only somewhat small (which would be acceptable, since the clothes she usually wears are loose still), I ordered 18m.",53459,3
53459,Can't get the shirt over her head.,53459,3
53459,"I get that it's supposed to be close-fitting, but she kind of needs to be able to fit her head through, lol.",53459,3
53459,"Anyways, I waited too long to try them on her (I bought them before the cold weather hit), so I can't return, but the pants fit well enough for now as a base layer so whatever.",53459,3
53459,I'm sure I'll find a use for the shirt with baby #2 or with friends' babies or whatever.,53459,3
53459,"I do like the color, though.",53459,3
53460,Thank you but the abaya does not fit plus its not fluffed,53460,3
53461,Top is Not the best for big breast women,53461,3
53462,"Nice, but larger than expected and heavy.",53462,3
53462,Bought these for my 80 year old mom.,53462,3
53462,She doesn't wear them much,53462,3
53463,Way too large and long.,53463,3
53463,I use them with a long shirt and boots or as jammie,53463,3
53465,Returned item as it was too large,53465,3
53466,Not what I was expecting - too loose.,53466,3
53466,BUT they are really cute so I kept them.,53466,3
53467,This shirt fits a little small,53467,3
53468,"They a lot lighter in person than on screen, more of royal blue.",53468,3
53469,Good purchase so far.,53469,3
53469,"Works as advertised, The only thing I would like is more of a structured bag, that doesn't slump over.",53469,3
53470,I generally wear a L/XL in women's clothing and this could easily be a 2-3X,53470,3
53471,I gave it 5 stars but had to take  away two because I washed it once in cold water and shrunk so bad o can't wear it anymore but it was cheap so I can't be too shocked but I liked this dress a lot.,53471,3
53471,I might but a replacement,53471,3
53472,"Downgraded rating because ""gold"" has already worn off charm.",53472,3
53473,"Pants were too small, top was just right.",53473,3
53474,"This dress is decent but on a short 5'1 girl as myself, I kind of swim in it.",53474,3
53474,The cappuccino color looks a bit unattractive in person.,53474,3
53474,I'm not sure I'll even get much use out of it.,53474,3
53475,"Had to return, fit ok, but says it will shrink.",53475,3
53475,Material and style is nice.,53475,3
53476,A lot more than most of them do.,53476,3
53478,I normally wear a XL to XXL but had to order a 6X by the size chart.,53478,3
53478,I can close it on the first set of hooks but it's  a lot tighter than it should be.,53478,3
53478,It's a good quality product.,53478,3
53478,But the size is smaller than expected.,53478,3
53478,I hope  this helps someone when they make their decision.,53478,3
53479,"I actually really like this product, but I'm giving it a 3 because the first zipper broke after just a couple of months.",53479,3
53479,"I purchased a new one, but there's already something weird going on with this zipper.",53479,3
53479,"There are other choices, I tried one of them - one that had an ID holder on the outside - and didn't care for it, so I went with this one again.",53479,3
53479,"Although the zipper doesn't quite close all the way without a struggle on my current wallet, I'll stick with it.",53479,3
53479,I am hope that the zipper holds on for a good long while.,53479,3
53480,This was a very cute dress.,53480,3
53480,"However, I had to return it due to split being too high.",53480,3
53481,I was satisfied with my purchase,53481,3
53483,"Got this for my wife, gave it to my daughter.",53483,3
53483,"I thought I ordered the right size, but a bit tight.",53483,3
53484,My 6 yr old kid really liked them.,53484,3
53484,The only bad part is one side of the shoe led works after a week of use.,53484,3
53484,Also the color on that side started to diminish its brightness and was not the same color as the other shoe.,53484,3
53485,The ring is absolutely adorable!,53485,3
53485,However my fingers are thicker closer to my knuckles.,53485,3
53485,I wear a size 8 in rings.,53485,3
53485,"When I adjust the ring to fit my fingers, the ring is barely on as the space between the tail and head is too long.",53485,3
53485,I am worried about wearing this out as it may fall off my fingers.,53485,3
53486,I really liked the shoes.,53486,3
53486,"Pros:
- fit as expected (I have chubby fit, and its laces permits that you tighten them up well)
- comfortable

Cons:
- My purpose was to use them to run at the beach, like wetting them and everything.",53486,3
53486,Turns out that the really hurted my feet after a 30m running and passing by the water while running...it looked pretty bad after and very sore too.,53486,3
53487,Looks great but has a very odd odor.,53487,3
53487,Can't get it out of it.,53487,3
53488,White PJ buttons on a pretty shirt!,53488,3
53489,The shirt design is perfect!,53489,3
53489,Exactly what I want if the decal was not falling off of the shirt when I got it!,53489,3
53489,It was half peeled off.,53489,3
53489,Luckily it was easy to fix with a cookie sheet and iron.,53489,3
53492,Too small in the breast area and fabric does not give.,53492,3
53493,This Shrug Bolero Cardigan is so very small!,53493,3
53493,"I wear a size medium top; so after reading reviews, I ordered a XXL size.",53493,3
53493,I can barely fit into this.,53493,3
53493,"It is OK, but am afraid to wash it, because if it shrinks at all, I will be out of luck!",53493,3
53493,"There are no instructions how to wash this, because it is written in Chinese.",53493,3
53493,"The color I ordered is beige, but it leans toward yellow.",53493,3
53493,Still quite pretty though.,53493,3
53493,"As long as I am careful with it, I can use it.",53493,3
53493,"I ordered the black one in XXXL, so I will see how that one fits.",53493,3
53494,I wasn't crazy about the print.,53494,3
53494,I'm picky about my leopard print.,53494,3
53494,Gave it to my daughter.,53494,3
53495,"you have to wear this just right our things pop out, our they ride up, really need a big set of balls for them to work properly",53495,3
53496,I love the print it it seems a bit bigger than I thought it would be.,53496,3
53496,Should have went a size smaller but other than that I am very pleased.,53496,3
53497,I wouldn't if I were you.,53497,3
53498,In regards to size it run a tad small and they are too loose on the sides.,53498,3
53499,This is a very sturdy top and I'm happy with the level of support it would provide if I kept it but it is slightly too large for me.,53499,3
53499,I measure as a 34DD at Victoria's Secret and although I ordered a 34DD the cup size is slightly large.,53499,3
53499,I also think that there is too much material for the tie around the neck.,53499,3
53499,"I am pretty petite at 5'2 but even so, I would have alot of slack hanging down my back after I tied the top in place.",53499,3
53500,The sleeves were way longer and baggy.,53500,3
53501,image did not look right and material felt cheaply made.,53501,3
53502,I have been wearing it for three weeks and the rose part fell off!!,53502,3
53502,It was really pretty and I loved it but I am not going to buy it again!,53502,3
53503,The item arrived as in the picture.,53503,3
53503,But the overall shirt looks a little strange for the office because of the style.,53503,3
53504,the collar is nothing like it is in the picture.,53504,3
53504,it just a plain round collar.,53504,3
53504,sad this is why I fell in love with this dress.,53504,3
53504,also the zip goes right to the end there is no area with a small slit at the front.,53504,3
53504,Material and colour satisfactory.,53504,3
53504,But all the things that pulled me to this dress are missing.,53504,3
53505,Cheesy the fit is off I mean just because they didn't work for me I still recommend them because they may work for you.,53505,3
53505,I got them fast and that was a plus.,53505,3
53506,"I wanted the blue and gold,but the silver and gold is ok.",53506,3
53507,Material is nice but they are considerably small.,53507,3
53507,I do have a large foot.,53507,3
53507,But these were short in my brothers feet.,53507,3
53508,I bought size 12-20 months.,53508,3
53508,That is way too large a size range.,53508,3
53508,I needed 12 month size and this was way too big.,53508,3
53508,I love the style and quality though.,53508,3
53508,I hope he will fit in it next year.....:(,53508,3
53510,"The product itself is great, but it runs very small!",53510,3
53510,The leg holes in particular are very small.,53510,3
53511,I ordered it Tuesday and got it Saturday so that was exciting .,53511,3
53511,It's completely see through tho which sucks .,53511,3
53511,I'm 6'1 and 265 lbs and it fits me lovely .,53511,3
53511,Only disappointment is its sheer .,53511,3
53511,Besides that it's lovely .,53511,3
53511,I'll fix it up for the event I plan to wear it to and post pics later :),53511,3
53512,Received Item as described well packed.,53512,3
53512,The material on this shirt is thin.,53512,3
53513,This shirt is very cute but ran VERY small.,53513,3
53513,"I wear a Large in pretty much every brand, and after reading reviews that said order up a size I ordered an XL.",53513,3
53513,"Unfortunately, this XL fit like a small!",53513,3
53513,Definitely order up at least a few sizes and don't even try it if you're at all busty.,53513,3
53514,Thought I was buying the Merino Brand.,53514,3
53514,This belt was OK but not the quality of Merino in form or function.,53514,3
53514,"Also, packaging was cheaper.",53514,3
53514,"It works and looks ok, but will stick with the ratchet brand leader!",53514,3
53514,"Original buckle broke, inside piece, but liked the belt width for Jeans; so, bought a replacement.",53514,3
53514,Hope it lasts a little longer.,53514,3
53514,My Merino's are still going strong.,53514,3
53515,Fit very small in US even after doing to size comparison and conversion.,53515,3
53515,Material was cheap but still cute design.,53515,3
53516,it does run small.,53516,3
53516,i wear a 2xl when i saw it i thought it would fit my daugther who wears a medium.,53516,3
53516,the fabric is stretchy and i could get in it but it just felt too tight.,53516,3
53517,the item looks a lot like the picture but it is no where near accurate for the size XL this it's the size I'd purchase at a store for this type of item but this one was nowhere close to being able to go on it might work better for a smaller busted individual,53517,3
53518,Nice hat but it was too small for my head.,53518,3
53518,I wear a 7 5/8 fitted cap.,53518,3
53519,"I bought one color of this nightie and loved the way it fit and felt, so I purchased 2 more in different colors.",53519,3
53519,When I opened the purple one I was shocked by the chemical smell.,53519,3
53519,I immediately washed it with a load of laundry.,53519,3
53519,After washing it I regretted including it with my other cloths.,53519,3
53519,"The nighty still smelled bad, so I washed it a second time.",53519,3
53519,"I think it is all right now, but I haven't worn it yet.",53519,3
53519,I give it a 3 because the first one is very comfortable.,53519,3
53519,When the company heard of the chemical issue the customer service response was excellent.,53519,3
53520,"I was really excited to get these, I'd been looking for this type of lens for a long time and after looking at them for months decided to buy them.",53520,3
53520,When they came in they were exactly what I was hoping for and were well packaged.,53520,3
53520,Whenever I wore these I received a lot of comments for their uniqueness.,53520,3
53520,I didn't wear them a whole lot at first but started giving them a lot of use over the past 6 months.,53520,3
53520,Just recently though the hinge on the right temple broke.,53520,3
53520,"I was disappointed because they were simply hanging in my pocket, they weren't bent or dropped.",53520,3
53520,Was kind of let down that a pair of sunglasses costing this much could break over basically nothing.,53520,3
53520,I'm still willing to call it a fluke this time and will probably purchase another pair sometime in the future.,53520,3
53521,"Was super excited to get these but the first time I put them on the waist string already broke off from the inside of the pants, not too big of a deal but they sit a little lower now and are a little bigger than expected.",53521,3
53521,The string must've been stressed before they were shipped out and No way it should've broke off frade like that.,53521,3
53521,"All in all the pants are a staple to my attire when working out, but I would've liked to see a better sturdier waist string and vinyl print for the lettering if I'm going to be advertising this product.",53521,3
53521,I'm afraid to wash these in the wash or else risk the lettering washing or fading off.,53521,3
53521,I may or may not buy these again...,53521,3
53521,"But I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest it, I've seen better and expected a LOT more from monsta...",53521,3
53521,I rated them #1 in my books but am now reconsidering...,53521,3
53522,Smells like plastic ):,53522,3
53523,It's a bit darker than I was expecting from the pictures and felt plastic-y.,53523,3
53523,Also it's a little hard to see the logo on the front.,53523,3
53523,I was satistfied but not necessarily impressed.,53523,3
53524,It didn't sit right on me.,53524,3
53524,Perhaps it's because I have big boobs and I'm short.,53524,3
53524,It looked like a mini dress on me.,53524,3
53525,Fit was spot on.,53525,3
53525,Only bad thing about it is that it wrinkles easily.,53525,3
53525,"I misread and though it was a ""no iron"" shirt, though I am very happy with its look and it feels like decent quality.",53525,3
53525,Also wish it wasn't made in China!,53525,3
53526,My son is age 7 months and in the 70th percentile.,53526,3
53526,"I got the size 12 months and they were tight, he outgrew them after maybe a week of wear.",53526,3
53526,They are cute though.,53526,3
53527,Nice shirt a little tight,53527,3
53528,I wear a size 40 C bra and the xx large was much too small.,53528,3
53528,"Also the zipper is really hard to put together, especially since the bra was too tight.",53528,3
53528,But it is a good looking bra that seems to be well made .,53528,3
53529,"My daughter loves it, however, I ordered a size 4T and instead, I received a size 6.",53529,3
53529,She uses it to swim and in her bubble baths quite often and the tail is already fading to black.,53529,3
53529,"But I guess as long as she loves it, that's all that should matter, I just wish I got what I paid for.",53529,3
53530,Pants fit as expected but the top runs tiny!,53530,3
53531,"I think this could have looked cute, but it was too big on me...

Im 5ft, 34DD, 29in waist and weigh around 120lbs...maybe it would look better if you're taller with a smaller waist?",53531,3
53531,"Not sure what it was, but it just hung very large on me, and I had gotten a small...I returned it.",53531,3
53531,"Don't be dissuaded though, because what doesn't work on my body, may work for you.",53531,3
53531,"The material wasn't very thin, so it didn't feel too cheap, so that was good.",53531,3
53531,It's too bad it didn't work for me.,53531,3
53532,"I've been on the search for the perfect legging and was hoping these might be it, but they aren't.",53532,3
53532,"For reference purposes, I'm 5'0"" tall and 115 lbs and ordered a size small.",53532,3
53532,"These leggings are not see through at all, which is great.",53532,3
53532,I'm petite and these are are good length on me.,53532,3
53532,The different colors seem like they are two totally different sizes.,53532,3
53532,The waist is awkwardly high and much tighter than the rest of the leggings.,53532,3
53532,These leggings run large.,53532,3
53532,"I'm never an XS in bottoms, but the small is a little baggy especially in the calves.",53532,3
53532,I'm hoping they shrink when I wash them.,53532,3
53532,"Overall, these are a good price and will be fine for lounging around the house, but they are not what I was looking for.",53532,3
53534,Bought this 2 months ago and lost it.,53534,3
53534,Went on Amazon to get another and it was 5 dollars more than the first time.,53534,3
53534,I was dissapointed but I bought it anyway.,53534,3
53534,It is worth the less expensive price.,53534,3
53535,Fits small by 2 sizes.,53535,3
53536,When received one container was broken and the Cream was all over the inside of the packaging.,53536,3
53536,A second container was leaking.,53536,3
53536,"So all in all I received one complete container, one half empty leaking container and one broken container.",53536,3
53537,"I wear a 9 1/2, ordered a 10, too small so am exchanging for size 11.",53537,3
53537,"They go great with my costume, however, so didn't want to totally give up on them.",53537,3
53537,"With an 11, I can put my liners in and be more comfortable.",53537,3
53538,I payed more to find a print my son would really love for his birthday - this one marked prints and solids - and they sent me solid black and grey.,53538,3
53538,"They are comfortable for him though, and a good quality.",53538,3
53538,"He is 35 pounds, and the small fits him perfect, with a little growing room.",53538,3
53539,Based on reviews I got a size larger than normal and I regretted it.,53539,3
53539,It fit somewhat large.,53539,3
53539,I also had a rip in the fabric which sucked.,53539,3
53539,"However, it's a super cute bathing suit .",53539,3
53539,Got lots of compliments.,53539,3
53539,4 of 5 in style.,53539,3
53539,2 of 5 in quality.,53539,3
53540,"Item was good, but the cup size was too small.",53540,3
53541,Nice product but...im 6'1 200lbs and i got the 2XL the largest size they offer but still to small.,53541,3
53541,Plus the pockets were alittle too high.,53541,3
53542,Both were lightweight which is good for Florida heat.,53542,3
53542,Colors true to pictures.,53542,3
53542,Unfortunately the size runs small so I am unable to wear them,53542,3
53543,"I normally wear a small, and so I read through the reviews and ordered a size up.",53543,3
53543,Apparently I should have ordered 2 sizes up as I couldn't even get the pant legs past my calves!,53543,3
53543,"But they looked nice, wish I could wear them",53543,3
53544,Ordered this for my wife as she is 29 weeks along.,53544,3
53544,She hasn't worn it much yet because she complains that it is too hot to wear while she is working as an RN and always running around.,53544,3
53544,Maybe it could be made of a more breathable/thinner material?,53544,3
53545,I bought this without realizing it had a gold-finish.,53545,3
53545,That was my fault and I should have looked closer.,53545,3
53545,I am not a gold or fake-gold fan so I ended up donating this set to Goodwill.,53545,3
53545,To the manufacturer - Could you please make more silver-plated jewelry?,53545,3
53545,"These pieces are so gorgeous, it stinks that they are mostly fake-gold.",53545,3
53546,Took forever to arrive and was too small.,53546,3
53547,It makes your hips look wide the way it is cut.,53547,3
53547,I won't be wearing it out of the house.,53547,3
53548,My son loves these cleats!,53548,3
53548,"They really seem to help prevent him from rolling his ankles, which was the main reason we purchased this particular cleat.",53548,3
53548,The reason for my 3 star review is the lettering began peeling off before his first game!,53548,3
53548,"When I spend more than $100 for a pair of shoes, I expect them to stay completely intact for more than 3 weeks!",53548,3
53549,"I wear this as a shirt, I should have gotten the next size up but I like the dress regardless.",53549,3
53549,It looks sleep as a turtleneck shirt.,53549,3
53549,I like it a lot.,53549,3
53550,"Although it fit,  had no pockets.",53550,3
53550,Not how a hoodie should fit...,53550,3
53550,"Needed more room,  but there were no other size options,  unfortunately.",53550,3
53550,"Otherwise,  very cute!",53550,3
53551,This suit was adorable.,53551,3
53551,"The bodice was true to size, but the bust was tiny!",53551,3
53551,I thought it looked like it would accommodate a larger bust based on the large swath of crisscross fabric.,53551,3
53551,But my size 16-18 suit came with an underwire and cup that was around a B cup.,53551,3
53551,"Additionally, when I took the suit out of the package, the underwire ends were protruding.",53551,3
53551,"If I had kept the suit, I would have had to do a repair to keep them in place.",53551,3
53551,"I wanted to love this, but both the suit and I would have needed surgery first!",53551,3
53552,I like it but its somewhat small,53552,3
53553,It's much shorter than described in the photo.,53553,3
53553,"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and it comes to about mid-thigh length in the back.",53553,3
53553,Also the fabric is much thinner.,53553,3
53553,I still like the way it fits over all tho.,53553,3
53553,Perfect for a cool summer's day/ warm fall...,53553,3
53554,The suit seemed to run a bit large.,53554,3
53554,The top seemed a bit big and the bottom sagged- got a large for a size 8-10 person.,53554,3
53554,May fit a person who is more curvy rather than straight and slim.,53554,3
53554,Return was easy and credited appropriately.,53554,3
53555,does not fit as a dress unless you have a short torso,53555,3
53556,Needed more support from the top.,53556,3
53557,"Really cute, but was about 2 sizes too small",53557,3
53558,I got the regular ones and they are too narrow for my head.,53558,3
53558,I will give them to someone with a smaller head.,53558,3
53558,I wish the product description had more information.,53558,3
53558,"You have to go to the actual Clic website to get useful info on sizes, etc.",53558,3
53559,It was a bit to large in the bust area,53559,3
53560,"They are made for older kids, they are very large on my 5 year old.",53560,3
53560,We have had them for about 6 months and used them 3 times and the screw on the side fell out.,53560,3
53560,It is not a huge deal because we can get another one but it is annoying.,53560,3
53561,you'll need a petticoat if you want it to flare out like the picture.,53561,3
53561,"in person, the color looks a bit more red than it does in the picture",53561,3
53562,It doesn't fit or look like the picture.,53562,3
53562,There's no shape at the top.,53562,3
53563,Wish the 1 for U night gowns plus sizes were cut fuller  Off,53563,3
53564,"Love it, get compliments on it.",53564,3
53564,It fell apart after the second wearing but I was able to fix it.,53564,3
53565,Dress looks nice but isn't the same one pictures.,53565,3
53565,Dress is more peach then pick.,53565,3
53565,The dress also doesn't have the same picture that you see in the photo.,53565,3
53565,They really need to change picture to the item they are going to send.,53565,3
53565,Also note dress is hard to put on yourself.,53565,3
53565,The back section you will need help with.,53565,3
53565,Also the back has a piece of frabric that goes under the laces and it seems to be little too small.,53565,3
53565,I had to tighten dress to the point of being not able to breath to get my back to not show.,53565,3
53566,Very cute but broke a week after having it,53566,3
53567,This product is not labeled correctly a 3 xl should not be that small,53567,3
53569,This dress arrived as seen in ad photos.,53569,3
53569,"It fits me perfectly....I am 32, 25, 34 measurements.",53569,3
53569,Texture of material is really soft and feminine.,53569,3
53570,The color is off.,53570,3
53570,It is definitely purple as opposed to royal blue.,53570,3
53570,My little dude was disappointed in that and so was I.,53570,3
53570,"Otherwise, the coat is good quality and fits well.",53570,3
53570,The sleeves zip off so it can be worn as a vest as well.,53570,3
53570,Shipped from China so it took quite awhile and it won't be worth a return for a different color.,53570,3
53570,We will be donating this to a needy family and trying again.,53570,3
53571,"Well...truth be told, and I hate being negative, but it did shrink quite a bit.",53571,3
53571,So much so...I had to give it to a smaller person.,53571,3
53571,I ordered an xl I believe.,53571,3
53571,Other than that...it was fine.,53571,3
53572,Another beautiful dress that belong in the junior section .,53572,3
53572,Loved the look of the dress way to small.,53572,3
53572,Just so frustrated not true to size,53572,3
53573,"It looks good and everything, just it's strapless.....in the picture it's not.",53573,3
53573,"Kinda a let down, other then that it's good!",53573,3
53574,The cowl neckline doesn't  lay quite like the photo shows.,53574,3
53574,It is more of a little droop than a cowl.,53574,3
53574,But I like the light weight fabric so I just wear a scarf with it to hide the neckline.,53574,3
53574,Goes great with dress pants or jeans.,53574,3
53575,It's snug around arm pits and a few other places nice otherwise,53575,3
53577,"Love the tanks, but I ordered Large and received Medium in a ""Large"" labeled bag...",53577,3
53579,The socks were different characters and design than what is shown in the picture.,53579,3
53580,Good watch for the money but  the band is starting to give.,53580,3
53581,I love the earrings and I love Silver Forest.,53581,3
53581,"I was unprepared, however, for how heavy they are (at least to me; I like very light earrings).",53581,3
53581,"I have other Silver Forest earrings which are about the same size, but they aren't heavy.",53581,3
53582,"The hat is good quality, but made for a bigger head.",53582,3
53582,It's NOT flex fit,53582,3
53583,This romper is kinda tight on my rear end but It works.,53583,3
53583,"I like the color and the patterns, would suggest buying a size up from your normal size though obviously.",53583,3
53584,"material is cute ,fits as expected.",53584,3
53584,Downside is the stitching is not so good..,53584,3
53584,The stitch has started falling apart,53584,3
53585,Metal feels way too cheap...  it feels like it'll fracture and crumble.,53585,3
53586,I am a small up top and the medium was too tight around the chest.,53586,3
53586,It does not drape around the chest it shows on the model.,53586,3
53586,It is also very short.,53586,3
53586,"I am 5'11"" though so most items are a little short on me anyhow, but this is not even appropriate for public.",53586,3
53587,Its fit pretty well a little loose but still very cute!!,53587,3
53588,Ya it's definitely a lot smaller than the picture portrays.,53588,3
53588,"The maniquin must be a child or small teen, so bust out the measuring tape and look at the dimensions to see if it is what you want.",53588,3
53588,"The inside liner feels like a cheap canvas, and the straps don't really allow for easy access to the insides.",53588,3
53588,It is really cute though.,53588,3
53588,The leather is really nice and pretty (I got the blue purse).,53588,3
53588,I'm going to return it though it's to small.,53588,3
53588,I'll check the measurements more carefully in the future.,53588,3
53589,"Band does not cover belly
Shrinks in the dryer
Wear more like capris than full length pants",53589,3
53590,"The jacket was beautiful but it run about two sizes small, so I sold it to a friend, I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for that",53590,3
53591,"I loved this bag, It has plenty of pockets, and was intended to use as a work tote.",53591,3
53591,My issue with it is its weight.,53591,3
53591,The hardware on this bag (feet at bottom) puts extra weight that I did need on my shoulder.,53591,3
53591,"I can easily fit, my surface pro, filofax planner, large cosmetic case, and files for work in this bag, but because of the extra weight its too heavy.",53591,3
53591,Definitely cannot add a water bottle or my cup with my smoothie.,53591,3
53591,I have to return this.,53591,3
53592,Bought two pair at different sizes.,53592,3
53592,They are cheaply made and the shirts stretched oddly after the first wear.,53592,3
53592,I like Carters better for sure.,53592,3
53594,The skirt fits way too big to where I can't even adjust it any tighter.,53594,3
53595,"The ring was not as shiny as the picture, but still a good deal for the price.",53595,3
53596,"The impression of the design is not good, it seems a bit bad and the position of the design is not the same as the photo of the product.",53596,3
53596,I expected something else.,53596,3
53597,Dress is absolutely gorgeous on me but not the right color I chose.,53597,3
53598,Mine had no thumbhole in one and one that was sewn shut in the other.,53598,3
53598,They are also tight on the hands.,53598,3
53598,My hands are not large by any stretch of the imagination.,53598,3
53598,"Still, they do the job and are bute enough.",53598,3
53599,"somewhat small and the ties that go around the dress are too short to wrap around twice, but I made it work",53599,3
53600,"I ordered the small, and it fits.",53600,3
53600,"However, there is a seam that runs across my backside.",53600,3
53600,"Not sure that I like it, and I am considering returning.",53600,3
53601,"I ordered the same based on the measurements and it came in wayyyyyyyy too small, i can't even put it passed my kness",53601,3
53602,"I normally wear an L, but buy XL for a loose fit, I ended up ordering the XL and it was HUGE!",53602,3
53602,I'd suggest to order your size or even 1 size down.,53602,3
53603,"Good quality, BUT a little on the short size...I ordered a 34 and it is actually an inch shorter than other 34 belts.",53603,3
53604,This part of the set as compared to the trolley luggage was actually a little disappointing.,53604,3
53604,It was still just as pretty and clean looking.,53604,3
53604,"It also came with a dust cover which was nice, but I felt like this lacked the workmanship that the other cases had included.",53604,3
53604,"During my flight to Rochester I hadn't left the Houston airport yet when one of the side straps fell off, I realized that this was because it was glued in an not properly sewn in or bolted.",53604,3
53604,It was okay that the closure straps were magnetic as this made it convenient to get in an out of.,53604,3
53604,The TSA lock did work but became a little crooked when I put stuff in it.,53604,3
53604,"Lastly, the strap to connect it to the handle of the roller luggage broke when I got off to Rochester so now I either need to fix it myself or forego this feature.",53604,3
53605,"The fabric is a good quality and the design is beautiful but I ordered a small at first, because I always get smalls in any bathing suit, but this one was incredibly small.",53605,3
53605,"I could barely get it over my thighs and hips, and when I did, I felt suffocated in it.",53605,3
53605,I sent it back and got a medium instead but now I'm thinking that I should have gotten a large just for more wiggle room.,53605,3
53606,It was cute but too large for me so I returned it.,53606,3
53608,in 6 weeks it broke dispointed,53608,3
53609,I ordered mine custom made.,53609,3
53609,It was put together very well and looks beautiful.,53609,3
53609,"But, it was not made well to my measurements.",53609,3
53609,"It's a little too long, and very large in the bust area as well as the straps.",53609,3
53609,It did ship very quickly and arrives before I needed it.,53609,3
53609,"Which was good, because now I have to take it somewhere to alter the size.",53609,3
53609,This might not be the case if you order a size and not custom.,53609,3
53609,"Overall, if you are looking for a nice inexpensive dress this is a great choice.",53609,3
53609,Just be prepared to have it tailored,53609,3
53610,Not as dark as in picture.,53610,3
53610,Very light weight material.,53610,3
53610,Small as well fits too close around neck to double over but too long if you dont,53610,3
53611,This does not look as long or like the picture but I will keep it to wear as a shirt.,53611,3
53612,It worked well for my wedding after it was jazzed up a bit.,53612,3
53613,"3"" Hole in the sleeve where it wasn't Sean.",53613,3
53614,"I ordered a large thinking it would fit
Me because I am normally a medium and the site said sizes run small, I should've ordered a xl.",53614,3
53615,it is not I was looking for.,53615,3
53615,I do not understand why does not show  the real size!,53615,3
53616,It's less modern looking than I expected but lightweight like I needed .,53616,3
53617,Looks very weird in the upper arm/sleeve area.,53617,3
53618,I gave it to my daughter who is is a size Small and I am XL,53618,3
53619,"Cute, I like the look.",53619,3
53619,hopefully will be a comfortable wear around shoes for errands,53619,3
53620,"This shirt is by far the worst for wrinkles - From the time I put it on to the time I get to work is about 45 minutes, by the tme I get to work it looks like I slept in it.",53620,3
53620,"If your looking for a no iron, low maintenance shirt - move along, this is not for you.",53620,3
53620,If you like looking like you sleep in your shirt - this is perfect.,53620,3
53621,these were ok for a vaca trip that I took and I lost three of them in the sand.,53621,3
53621,I think that I needed to get used to wearing them closer to the ends of my fingers first.,53621,3
53622,I thought it would be a tad bit longer but overall I love it.,53622,3
53623,"These seem like nice pants, but be sure to order several sizes up.",53623,3
53623,They run VERY small.,53623,3
53626,it was weird and not properly stitched right,53626,3
53627,I would give it 4 stars but the sizing was way off in my opinion.,53627,3
53627,The shipping was fast (I pay for Amazon prime so I had 2 day shipping) it was very good fabric except the collar area it did resemble a moo moo as some people called it lol.,53627,3
53627,It's very cute though.,53627,3
53627,I couldn't wear because it was way too big and baggy.,53627,3
53627,But I don't think it's a bad product because for the price it's cute but they need to get the sizing correct.,53627,3
53627,"I paid for this item, I didn't send it back because I'm lazy lol.",53627,3
53627,I gave it to my mom.,53627,3
53628,You can't have breasts with all that padding.,53628,3
53629,My name tag stays on all day.,53629,3
53629,I'm a CNA and have no issues keeping this on however the color  was lighter than I expected or wanted thought I was getting dark pink and it came very light pink.,53629,3
53630,Dress came in much larger than expected still plan on using it but I would order a size smaller.,53630,3
53631,"But it's a short belt, very short.",53631,3
53631,It smells like dirt or earthy.,53631,3
53631,It's weird I've had it for a few weeks and the smell will not go away.,53631,3
53631,I'm a size 31 waist and the size I ordered is shirt by 5inches.,53631,3
53632,Let me start by saying this outfit looks like the picture...,53632,3
53632,However the top if you have been blessed in that department you will have some trouble the length is the issue other than that cute outfit...,53632,3
53633,Another one that came at a different time & I didn't have sense enough to send it back,53633,3
53634,Everyone was saying it ran small.,53634,3
53634,My son is a boys large/ xl so O went up one size and bought an Adult small.,53634,3
53634,Material is sturdy and will last for more than one use so that is a plus.,53634,3
53635,"It is a cute bathing suit but unless you have big breasts, the top is too loose.",53635,3
53635,The bottom fit great but the top was huge and there is no way to adjust the strings to make it tighter.,53635,3
53636,Had to sell it the shoes was to tight...I was BUGGED.,53636,3
53637,"A bit tight around the legs, but perfect otherwise!!",53637,3
53638,"Bottom fits fine, it's the top that needs more fabric.",53638,3
53639,The strap does not hold much weight.,53639,3
53639,Other than that its nice.,53639,3
53640,Says purple rhinestones but they are pink and fewer than what is pictured,53640,3
53641,I'm a small / xsmall usually.,53641,3
53641,Thank goodness I did.,53641,3
53641,"Even at a larger than normal size, the top is too short for me to comfortably wear in most settings.",53641,3
53642,It arrived with scratches on the lenses.,53642,3
53643,Its a realy cute swim suit but the bottoms were way to small the top fit perfectlet i prob would of needed a medium bottom not small,53643,3
53644,"Nice material but as others write, runs pretty small due to the clingy material.",53644,3
53646,"The quality was fine and hoop easily removable, but length is way too short for my dress.",53646,3
53646,I am 5'4 and 130 pounds-to give idea if how short it is.,53646,3
53647,"The bra is does not fit as expected, it is too light fot sports.",53647,3
53648,"Pattern is very beautiful, quality in general.",53648,3
53649,pretty but smells weird.,53649,3
53649,the hardware looks decent.,53649,3
53649,it arrived as expected,53649,3
53650,"The cotton was really soft and the print lasted as well through washes (gentle cycle) however, the type of cotton made me feel warmer than normal t-shirts when wearing it.",53650,3
53651,I got one pair in coral and another pair in black.,53651,3
53651,The black ones fit great but the coral is too small..,53651,3
53651,I got a size medium.,53651,3
53652,will do to keep my little man from being cold in the morning.,53652,3
53653,"These are nice, but they are not substantial at all.",53653,3
53653,They are very light weight and dainty.,53653,3
53653,"I like them, I just wish they were a little bigger.",53653,3
53654,"I'm 5'2"" and generally wear an xl in tops and bottoms pants are usually a 16 or 18 depending on brand.",53654,3
53654,I carry more weight on the bottom half.,53654,3
53654,"I fit in the top half fits mostly ok. the ""apron ties""  are loose and hang.",53654,3
53654,I have a 38 DDD chest and they lay limp.,53654,3
53654,So I will be reattaching them so it lays nice.,53654,3
53654,The bottom half fits OK but pulls a little.,53654,3
53654,The packaging says for the XL size it fits up to size 22.,53654,3
53654,I don't think it would.,53654,3
53654,It's stretchy but the slit might rip and you would probably look like you're in a maid sausage casing.,53654,3
53654,I should also say I tried it on while wearing spanx and a corset.,53654,3
53654,"Chest measurement 45"", waist 37"" and hips 52""
My proportions are off for where the waist line hits.",53654,3
53654,It's almost a drop waist on me.,53654,3
53654,And its surprisingly short.,53654,3
53654,I'm short so I figured it would be about knee length.,53654,3
53654,"Its easily 4"" above the knee.",53654,3
53654,and then there is the slit- which is almost panty flashing.,53654,3
53654,So I'm wearing a yoga boy shorts so I'm not flashing.,53654,3
53654,Costume is a kind of cheap but it will work.,53654,3
53654,I wish I didn't spend nearly $50 on it- isn't worth the price.,53654,3
53654,If I hadn't decided to throw a RHPS party in 10 days I probably would have looked elsewhere or asked a local seamstress to make a costume.,53654,3
53654,Oh and the hat is useless,53654,3
53655,Top doesn't fit loose at the bottom like the product picture.,53655,3
53655,"I'm 5'6"" 130lbs and a B cup.",53655,3
53655,"I honestly don't think this would fit anyone with a large bust, it fits across my chest without any wiggle room.",53655,3
53655,The straps are a faux leather and the back seems to drape much lower than product picture and the back is pretty sheer.,53655,3
53655,Since the top was only $6 I can't complain too much.,53655,3
53656,"I ordered these because they look different in the photo,but identical to another pair that i ordered on here that seems costume like.",53656,3
53656,"I haven't asked if prescription lens could be put in yet,but the nose area is slightly smaller compared to the other one,so i would perfer this over that.",53656,3
53656,Just not similar to the photo or what I wanted.,53656,3
53657,Cute but way too short to wear out of the house.,53657,3
53657,"Also, the leg holes are so large that not only does your butt hang out but so does the rest of your privates.",53657,3
53657,My husband loves them for me to wear around the house for just him though.,53657,3
53658,Thinner than i would like.,53658,3
53659,The top should be black and not happy that it was only one size to choose from,53659,3
53660,"I received something totally different, the pendulum is shaped nothing like the photo and it doesn't have the heart on the end, I am disappointed this is not what I paid for",53660,3
53661,EARS WERE REALLY SMALL,53661,3
53663,"It was way too big, had to belt it and my usual size is 14.",53663,3
53663,Could have fit someone who wears a size 18 so.,53663,3
53664,"Thin terrible quality fabric, not anything like the picture.",53664,3
53664,So oodly stretchy that I can only use It as a PJ shirt.,53664,3
53665,I love the Beachcoco dresses in strapless.,53665,3
53665,This was my first dress with the tank fitting at the top.,53665,3
53665,I'm really sad that they have failed to make the boob area big enough for pregnant women.,53665,3
53665,You think that if its a maternity dress that they would make this area a little bit larger.,53665,3
53665,"I will keep the dress because its soft and beautiful and I will be pregnant through out the summer and will need tons of dresses, but I'm not happy that I have to wear a cami under the dress to prevent showing off a ton of cleavage.",53665,3
53665,"Don't get me wrong, cleavage when going out is fine, but not when I'm working 5 days a week in a bank!",53665,3
53666,Got for wife and she likes it,53666,3
53667,too many bright colors and repeats of colors,53667,3
53668,The dress was for my daughter.,53668,3
53668,She liked the fit and the material of the dress as well as the style.,53668,3
53668,"However, the rose color depicted in the picture was much darker than the real color.",53668,3
53669,I ordered a large and it was small.,53669,3
53669,Very pretty shirt but the material doesn't stretch at all,53669,3
53670,"Not as good of a sock as I expected, or as some others I have used to pre vent blisters but it is okay.",53670,3
53670,I recommend toe socks for people who get a lot of blisters even if you do not have toe shoes.,53670,3
53671,They are fine in the front and are comfortable the back is a little tight on me but I still like them.,53671,3
53671,The other pair I have that isn't a thong fit much better.,53671,3
53672,"Ordered a large, but fits me more like a S/M",53672,3
53673,"I went a size bigger based on what people's comments said (because when these companies do S,M,L apparently they don't like to put a size chart so you're left guessing) and it's not as big as I would have thought.",53673,3
53673,When my milk comes in they likely won't fit anymore and I was trying to get bigger so that they would.,53673,3
53674,I ordered a 6.5 but the sticker on the bottom of the shoe says 5.5.,53674,3
53674,The box says 6.5.,53674,3
53674,"I'd send them back and order a half size up, but I'm not sure how I'd order it..needless to say, I'm not sending them back for only $16 and the rare occasion I'll wear them.",53674,3
53674,"My left heel hangs over a tad, but the right fits fine.",53674,3
53675,I've kept it because returning is not an option.,53675,3
53675,I will gift but it's VERY small.,53675,3
53675,I would order 3 sizes larger than your usual size..,53675,3
53676,After reading the reviews I thought I would be able to fit my iPhone 6plus with case.,53676,3
53676,But with my otter box there is no way to fit my phone.,53676,3
53676,"Also, very few holders for cards.",53676,3
53676,And the ones that are there make it very difficult to find the cards you need.,53676,3
53676,Because of the depth of each card pocket they aren't porprtional and some go in too far and the other ones stick out too much so you can only see one card.,53676,3
53676,The quality seems good though and the red color is nice.,53676,3
53676,Going to use it for now until I find something better.,53676,3
53677,"if we're being honest it was constructed poorly, but I made it work I had to buy black boy shorts just as other post stated and it worked out...but with that being said it was super cute I got sooooooooooooo many compliments!!",53677,3
53678,Material was very thin for a T shirt priced over $20!,53678,3
53679,I am just about 6 ft tall.,53679,3
53679,Leggings fit but stretch a bit thin.,53679,3
53679,All in all they are fine and I will keep them.,53679,3
53679,Will be curious about their durability.,53679,3
53680,"Tight in the booty, waist and length are as expected",53680,3
53681,The shoes themselves are great....don't go by the measurement on the cm though.......these are several months away from wear.,53681,3
53682,Pretty top quick delivery,53682,3
53684,Product kind of cheaply made and not true to size!,53684,3
53685,"This worked to wear once, I wore it for a wedding while nursing my 2 month old.",53685,3
53685,But the skirt fabric is very thin and didn't survive a wash.,53685,3
53686,Came a little wrinkled,53686,3
53687,"Very lumpy so I couldn't use it, but the length was as expected.",53687,3
53687,Could be used if under several layers or very thick material,53687,3
53688,"Love the shoes and the fact that they light up is freakin great, got so many compliments and so many ""are those yeezys"" that it's crazy, I love it!",53688,3
53688,butttttt the shoe itself is very poor quality and some of the lights are already going out from just having them for a week soo..,53688,3
53689,"Pretty and priced right, but this overwhelms in size.",53689,3
53689,Will use for warmth while on the couch but probably will never wear it out of the house.,53689,3
53690,Cap is nice enough but the top part is hard and inflexible and not exactly what I was looking for.,53690,3
53691,Its great if you only care to use it a few times but the elastic broke off pretty easily...,53691,3
53692,"The image is already washed out but didn't expect much anyway, it's just a shirt.",53692,3
53693,This is such a weird top.,53693,3
53693,I don't even know how to say it fits because it's all over the place.,53693,3
53693,"I got a US10 (tag on the shirt itself says XL) but it is pretty form-fitting in the body, and I generally wear a medium or even a small.",53693,3
53693,I would say the body of the XL (US10) is probably closer to a biggish size medium or a smallish size large (or M/L I suppose would also be an accurate descriptor).,53693,3
53693,"The top straps on the shoulders, however, are waaaay too long.",53693,3
53693,"They make this shirt sit super low on my chest, and the arms sag way down and are almost full-length sleeves on me, which might possibly be somewhat cute except the gap between that first strap on top and the next one down on the arm is just really big, and everything is super saggy and loose and gappy and just not in any way cute at all.",53693,3
53693,It just looks so weird.,53693,3
53693,"Luckily, I can make this wearable by altering the straps at the top to be about half the length they came, and then it fits pretty much how it looks on the model in the picture.",53693,3
53693,"So I'm going to describe the fit as ""too small"" because while the sleeves can be made to fit in a decent way, since the strappy parts are pretty thin and easy to cut and resew back in place (although I have to remove stars for even needing to do that in the first place), the body is not anywhere near a size XL.",53693,3
53693,"Still, I guess if you know what you're getting into it's a reasonably cute and comfortable top, as long as you size way up and are open to making some modifications.",53693,3
53694,Glad you reminded me I meant to try an XL,53694,3
53695,These are too big for my nose and for my daughters..,53695,3
53696,Sizing did not match up....way too big or way too small,53696,3
53697,Nice material but once you put cards in it the wallet becomes incredibly thick.,53697,3
53698,The Jack Daniel's logo is not white.,53698,3
53698,"The whole outline of the image and the Jack Daniel's picture, etc is grayish blue.",53698,3
53698,"Not sure if it was just ours that this happened with, or if it's just not pictured correctly.",53698,3
53699,It's longer then shown in picture and went way past my knees.,53699,3
53699,It is impossible to put this on if you only have two arms.,53699,3
53699,You can tell by how tight i had to tie it to keep the dress up by how much of the fabric is scrunched in the back.,53699,3
53699,Also decided it wasn't flattering for me as it made me loo wider then I really am.,53699,3
53699,Just not for my body.,53699,3
53700,Its bigger in the top than expected.,53700,3
53700,And a little to long.,53700,3
53701,"They're just OK. Not as good at glare reduction as a pair of prescription polarized glasses I  own, but better than regular sunglasses.",53701,3
53702,Wish this had an interior drawstring for adjusting the size.,53702,3
53702,It kept falling into my daughter's face.,53702,3
53702,I sewed a little tuck into it and that seemed to help but makes it look awkward.,53702,3
53702,The solid colors have drawstrings but the prints don't.,53702,3
53703,They are small I just gave them to my son,53703,3
53708,It fit everywhere except the bust area.,53708,3
53708,Will wear with a cove because it's super cute otherwise.,53708,3
53709,Boots look very cheap in person,53709,3
53710,"Runs smaller than I thought it would, and fabric not terribly pleasant; I hope that with hand-washing and drying a couple of times it will soften up somewhat.",53710,3
53710,"This is a nice shade of lavender, and armhole placement/size good.",53710,3
53710,"Although quality not exciting, the low price is great.",53710,3
53711,Chiped from when the abalone was set into the bone.,53711,3
53712,Not crazy about the fake slide rule bezel that doesn't rotate.,53712,3
53712,Relegating the stop watch second hand to the small dial instead of the large second hand makes this function less useful.,53712,3
53713,The rubber circles sometimes take a while to put in the sterling silver circles and at times they don't stay put,53713,3
53714,Have bought several shirts from this seller & have loved all until this one.,53714,3
53714,The lace trim and the shirt color are totally different and this one fits smaller than the rest.,53714,3
53715,"They were way too small, but other than that, as expected: light weight and moderately well made.",53715,3
53716,Cute dress and loved it at first but after a few washings it's starting to fade in color.,53716,3
53716,Also if you have large breasts this doesn't give them the most coverage.,53716,3
53716,I really thought it was great in the beginning but as everything has gotten bigger I don't love it as much.,53716,3
53717,"The torso is a good fit, but the sleeves are too short for me at 6',3"".",53717,3
53718,it's cute but fits like a medium,53718,3
53719,"I love the shoes themselves,  but they definitely run large.",53719,3
53719,I just had my son measured last week and was told he is an 8.,53719,3
53719,"I ordered an 8 of these,  and they were waaay too big.",53719,3
53719,Went down to a 7 and they are still large.,53719,3
53719,"They will stay on when he walks,  but are not even snug around his foot and he can easily slide his foot around.",53719,3
53720,Not really what i expected but still pretty.,53720,3
53720,A little slaggy in the chest but i guess an adhesive bra will do.,53720,3
53721,I was a little disappointed by how short this turned out to be.,53721,3
53721,"I'm 5'3"" and petite and it barely covered my hips.",53721,3
53721,"However, I do like the material and I think it was sewn nicely.",53721,3
53721,It'll work as a coverup for the family trip to the water park with the in laws and the annual florida trip with my family.,53721,3
53722,"The product quality is excellent, it would however fit a child, not even a size-4 adult and I ordered an XL.",53722,3
53722,I cannot recommend as a piece of adult clothing.,53722,3
53723,Too bad I can't really wear it...,53723,3
53723,It makes my neck itch and it breaks me out...,53723,3
53725,Not like the photo.,53725,3
53725,Very sparkly and full of sequins.,53725,3
53726,it was perfect for my Halloween costume.,53726,3
53727,Colors are not as bright - a bit muddy.,53727,3
53727,"As the other review said, there is no seaming.",53727,3
53727,Even the cutting is not straight.,53727,3
53727,"If I had saw this in a boutique or art show I would not have bought it; however, if it had been brighter I would have.",53727,3
53728,its a bi6t too big for me but I like it,53728,3
53729,"Dress looks beautiful online, but looks much cheaper once it arrives.",53729,3
53729,I ordered my normal size and couldn't get it zipped up around my rib cage...not even close to zipped.,53729,3
53729,I ordered the dress with extra length to be safe and it was extremelyyy long.,53729,3
53729,"Typically this would be great because  dresses are usually too short (I'm 6'0), but I would've needed to get it hemmed quite a bit just so I could walk without tripping on myself.",53729,3
53730,Confusing to put on,53730,3
53731,"It served it's purpose for a necklace photoshoot, but it is cheaply made, and was crooked.",53731,3
53731,"Thankfully, that can be corrected in our photos using Photoshop.",53731,3
53731,"If you need to use a neck form frequently, keep looking for something better.",53731,3
53732,I get lots of compliments on this bag but it smells terrible inside.,53732,3
53732,Also I wish the straps would individually attach  as a backpack.,53732,3
53732,If you put one strap on your shoulder it drops the entire length before you can get the other on.,53732,3
53732,It's one leather strap threaded through a loop.,53732,3
53733,This dress looks beautiful on my daughter.,53733,3
53733,The only problem is she has a large chest.,53733,3
53733,The dress is not made for a woman that is big breasted.,53733,3
53733,We kept the dress and had it altered because we loved it so much.,53733,3
53733,It is for a July outdoor wedding and it seemed to have be cooler than other long black dresses,53733,3
53734,Got these as gifts for my wife's friends.,53734,3
53735,The jumpsuit is super short.,53735,3
53735,I purchased a small for my 11yr old that needed a Rosie the Riveter costume - fits her fine.,53735,3
53735,Crappy workmanship & there were strings coming out everywhere that needed to be clipped.,53735,3
53735,Served its purpose but not worth the price at all.,53735,3
53736,It fitted just right but i did want it a little baggy...other than that nice thickness for arizona weather!,53736,3
53737,It was quite large,53737,3
53739,Super cute but i ordered my usual size.,53739,3
53739,This doesnt even touch.,53739,3
53739,"It made a great gift, however i suggest a size up.",53739,3
53740,The shape is boxy.,53740,3
53740,Felt pretty masculine to me.,53740,3
53740,Warm and comfy though.,53740,3
53741,This product is super adorable but was way too small.,53741,3
53741,I ordered a size way above mine and my boobs didn't even fit at all into the top.,53741,3
53741,I couldn't even wear it.,53741,3
53742,I ordered this shirt in 3 different sizes for 3 different aged children.,53742,3
53742,"All 3 sizes run SMALL, and I have small/petite children.",53742,3
53742,I highly recommend ordering AT LEAST one size UP!,53742,3
53743,"Very cheap material, but what do you expect for something that I got for $8.",53743,3
53743,It is very nice though.,53743,3
53744,I concur with the review made before me.,53744,3
53744,Its a decently made license plate frame with a cheap sticker poorly adhered to it.,53744,3
53744,I'm certain it won't survive the Las Vegas heat so I would have to purchase clear coat and spray it over.,53744,3
53745,left side leather is darker than the right side.,53745,3
53746,Cute dress just not for a curvy body type.,53746,3
53746,Way too short but if you are a petite person this may end up looking much better!,53746,3
53746,"Like the dress, just not for me.",53746,3
53747,"I received wrong color, but item itself seems to be made out of quality marterial",53747,3
53748,Cons:  The fabric is like parachute material.,53748,3
53748,"It's a tiny bit short (just above the knee; I'm 5'7ish)
Pros: It packs incredibly small, fits well, looks good.",53748,3
53748,Fit as expected per size chart.,53748,3
53748,The color/style (I got the multicolor one) is fun.,53748,3
53748,"I'm keeping it because I need travel dresses, and it was incredibly cheap.",53748,3
53748,"I wouldn't pick a dress with fabric like this off the rack at a thrift store, but",53748,3
53749,For the money I thought it would be made better than it is.,53749,3
53749,Hopefully it will bring me good luck anyway.,53749,3
53750,Have to be careful when hooking at the side of your pants.,53750,3
53750,It's safer to hook it in ur small jeans pocket or bra.,53750,3
53751,This is super cute but i will have to wear a strapless bra underneath & booty shorts because once it gets wet you'll be able to see right through it.,53751,3
53751,Both the top & bottoms are 1 size too big & i am a medium but went off the reviews of ppl saying it ran small.,53751,3
53752,It is a nice piece.,53752,3
53752,It came much more quickly than stated when it placed the order.,53752,3
53753,"I like this top, but even an xl is too tight.",53753,3
53753,"I'm 5'7"" and weigh 150",53753,3
53754,"Cute shoe, but after one day of school the front edges were already worn off.",53754,3
53754,Better for just a dress up shoe.,53754,3
53755,It's a crop top not a tank,53755,3
53756,The pin brought on the same day I received it.,53756,3
53757,"They were beautiful pants, however I had to send them back because they did run very small.",53757,3
53757,"I was kind of heart broken because I really wanted them to fit, but there was no way.",53757,3
53758,I ordered the extra small as these were apparently for adults.,53758,3
53758,My 11 year old daughter is a size 3.,53758,3
53758,They were too big.,53758,3
53758,Her friend is a size 4.,53758,3
53758,They fit so we gave them to her.,53758,3
53758,(She has another friend who is a size 5-6 and they were too small for her).,53758,3
53758,Delivery took about 2 weeks.,53758,3
53759,"way way way too small, if you are tiny order a large....",53759,3
53760,The underwear holds well the urine initially; however it was impossible for me to take them off without leaking it on to the bathroom floor.,53760,3
53761,Not crazy about the fabric,53761,3
53762,"i got the cowl neck shirt in beige its a very strange fabric, like a mesh that reminds me of mosquito netting its fairly see through but I was planning on using it under a suit jacket so it should be fine.",53762,3
53762,Not great but for $10 not awful either,53762,3
53763,I really love this band.,53763,3
53763,The tote bag was kinda a let down due to the face that it was smaller than what I thought it was going to be.,53763,3
53763,"Also, I was disappointed that Zac's face is cut off on both sides.",53763,3
53763,Come on now everybody knows that Zac Hanson is the most handsome Hanson brother.,53763,3
53763,We want to see Zac's face the most.,53763,3
53763,Tha is just common sense!,53763,3
53764,Lenses are smaller than I expected and could be darker.,53764,3
53765,"They're a nice size, and they're not heavy.",53765,3
53765,They do hang weird so it'd be nice if the back had a design as well.,53765,3
53765,"Not bad overall, though.",53765,3
53766,"I ordered a larger size,but it was still too small.",53766,3
53766,They really fit small .,53766,3
53766,Not the size for the average person.,53766,3
53767,"It's a gorgeous print, but the fabric is a little poor quality, not cotton",53767,3
53768,"I bought for my husband  although the size was fine, the fabric is not one of the good ones.",53768,3
53768,He ended up using at home,53768,3
53769,"The company was awesome to deal with, but the top is not at all comparable to size chart they have to compare too.",53769,3
53769,"I bought and XL due to measurements given, I could have worn a Medium.",53769,3
53769,I gave a 3 star because they were so great about my refund.,53769,3
53769,"and the top is pretty, but its more of a nylon top and not stitched like it appears in the picture.",53769,3
53771,the sleeves are very narrow - otherwise the fit is okay,53771,3
53772,Quality of material was good but the cut did nothing but accent the worst part of my body (around my waistline).,53772,3
53772,"I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and ordered a medium.",53772,3
53772,Will be returning because it's not the most flattering on me but it isn't awful.,53772,3
53773,"however sleeve width is for a slender build only, could not fit around a bicep larger than 14 inches.",53773,3
53773,Skinny fashions belong in Europe!,53773,3
53773,"Besides ""skinniness"" is not about style, just saving money on material.",53773,3
53774,I got the Large and was tight,53774,3
53775,"Look exactly as pictured and I'm happy with the appearance, they are, however, incredibly lightweight even compared to another $12 pair I bought the same day.",53775,3
53775,Fine for a pair to knock around!,53775,3
53776,Hate the inside material had to change it to black.,53776,3
53777,Really small and hard to put on.,53777,3
53777,Cute once I got them on.,53777,3
53778,Looks good right now...still in the package actually... Let you know after I open/wear it...!,53778,3
53779,It's thicker than I wanted.,53779,3
53780,Its pretty but runs a bit small,53780,3
53781,The costume came and fits as expected.,53781,3
53781,It is the same quality you would get from any Halloween costume store.,53781,3
53781,It is overpriced for the quality of material but they all are so there were no surprises here.,53781,3
53782,I love the looks of this belt but it isn't as high quality as I like.,53782,3
53782,"It also tend to come ""unfastened"" which is embarrassing",53782,3
53783,Yes it did made a really cute Easter basket.,53783,3
53785,The case is thin but not as protective.,53785,3
53785,The glasses is also thin but not so easy to wear.,53785,3
53785,It is still useful that is why 3 stars,53785,3
53786,I bought these for a small 5 year old and it just fits.,53786,3
53786,I am afraid it won't fit him next winter.,53786,3
53787,Butt lifter is not flattering.,53787,3
53788,"It's actually quite lovely, the material is not that sheer and could be easily worn with leggings if one felt it was too sheer.",53788,3
53788,"However, the sizing is truly for Asian women who are much tinier than Western Women.",53788,3
53788,I am a size 6-8 and I could barely get this over my entire body.,53788,3
53788,"Sadly, it must be returned.",53788,3
53788,If they had it in an extra large it would be a lovely tunic.,53788,3
53789,"While these are SOFT, I was looking for compression underwear.",53789,3
53789,These AREN'T  compression.,53789,3
53790,The color is not what this picture looks like...,53790,3
53791,Was disappointed in the tight fit around the torso,53791,3
53792,"I expected a bit more of a grip on the bottom, they still help on tile floors though.",53792,3
53792,Love the different colors!,53792,3
53794,I'm going to reorder in a much smaller size.,53794,3
53794,I gave it to someone that is a plus size,53794,3
53795,You could get it from a vendor on the street for $5,53795,3
53797,The red coral color is actually a bright orange.,53797,3
53797,I am a small curvy woman and I wanted a smaller fit for a Brazilian style bathing suit.,53797,3
53797,Make sure to order the size up.,53797,3
53797,The quality was fine and the package came on time.,53797,3
53798,I liked it pretty good !,53798,3
53799,"Loved them, they are just WAY too big... returning!",53799,3
53800,I LOVE the style of the hat!,53800,3
53800,Actually I have a couple almost exactly like them gotten a few years back and I have been looking for some to replace them!,53800,3
53800,These are a little smaller and lighter in color.,53800,3
53800,I like them a little larger so I can put my hair under them to protect from our hot sun.,53800,3
53800,Also I like them darker so they match my blue jeans which I like wearing.,53800,3
53800,Having said that.... the style and quality are great!,53800,3
53800,I get compliments all the time when wearing it!,53800,3
53803,Don't think I can return it if it's already been worn.,53803,3
53804,The medium is like a small,53804,3
53805,It was a gift for my friend.,53805,3
53805,But the chain broke the first week.,53805,3
53805,But you can always replace a chain.,53805,3
53805,So its not a big deal.,53805,3
53807,"This is a cute bikini, although mine was NOT sewn correctly!",53807,3
53807,Everything looks like the picture except my draping isn't sewn right.,53807,3
53807,It's supposed to flow open in the middle and mine was not cut correctly(see my pic).,53807,3
53807,"Be that as it may, this was somewhat expected because it came from mass production  overseas, and since I am able to sew, I can fix it to look the way it's supposed to look.",53807,3
53807,"Boob area a tad small, but I am pretty ""healthy"" up top (38D), and the bottom actually fits but could be a little looser.",53807,3
53807,I'm a size 8 and bought an XL which is workable.,53807,3
53807,If it actually came sewn the right way I would give it a 5 star.,53807,3
53807,Definitely order 2 sizes up from your regular size!,53807,3
53808,Cute but fitted smaller then size.,53808,3
53809,Pretty...but the quality was the least spectacular of all the things I have purchased from this seller.,53809,3
53809,Definitely not top drawer...starting to look like dollar store items instead of the pretty things I send people to Amazon for when I get compliments.,53809,3
53811,"Nice wallet, but I ordered the brown ( looks like a darker brown in the pic) when I got it, it's orange like Donald Trump.",53811,3
53812,I love the way this bracelet looks but the chain broke the second time I wore it,53812,3
53814,Very cheap looking the bottom is see through,53814,3
53815,These shines fit great with one exception.,53815,3
53815,"I need the width in my sole area, but the whole shoe was wide and there was no adjustment to be made at the top strap.",53815,3
53815,So it gaped and looked ridiculous.,53815,3
53816,"made a decent gift, at least.... for a smaller person than myself.",53816,3
53817,"I got it as a gift for a friend, but was a bit bummed that one side of he bracelet the metal was not connected properly.",53817,3
53817,"I thought this was a wrap, but it is stiff with an opening like the C shaped bangles that you slide on the arm.",53817,3
53817,It just wasn't as well made as I had hoped.,53817,3
53818,It is exceptionally small.,53818,3
53818,"The company said it's marked as asian sizes, but the size chart that pops up does not indicate that.",53818,3
53818,I ordered according to the size chart and it was laughable.,53818,3
53818,"The bodice ended at my boobs, instead at the waist as pictured.",53818,3
53818,"The back ended above my bra band, instead of at the small of my back as pictured.",53818,3
53818,"The dress itself seemed well made, just at least 3 sizes off.",53818,3
53819,"It works, but in a strong wind it still turns inside out.",53819,3
53819,It was also much heavier and larger than I anticipated.,53819,3
53820,I thought the bottoms were gonna be a lot more cheeky!,53820,3
53820,which makes me sad.,53820,3
53820,Because thats what i was looking for!,53820,3
53822,Medium top fit perfect but the bottom did not fit or look right.,53822,3
53822,Have to be very thick at the bottom,53822,3
53823,Bought the medium for my girl and it was way to tight but great quality.,53823,3
53824,"The crystal tooth actually fell out the third day my son wore it, but he is 10 and was outside playing in the snow while wearing it.",53824,3
53824,Luckily we found it and were able to glue it back into place much more securely.,53824,3
53824,Probably would not be a problem for an adult or older child however.,53824,3
53824,Still had to dock a couple of stars for it though.,53824,3
53826,"I read the reviews and went by that but I felt it was a little big, nice though but a tad big",53826,3
53827,"For the price, you can't expect much.",53827,3
53827,The material is fairly cheap and somewhat sheer and the hem is poorly done.,53827,3
53827,"However, it fits nice as a maternity dress and that's what I was looking for to begin with.",53827,3
53827,Overall it's an OK product!,53827,3
53829,somewhat heavy shirt and the transfer was a bit smaller than i had expected thought the tshirt is of great quality a gildan at that :) yet the transfer made me sweat in the climates im in most so not too comfortable currently for this season.,53829,3
53830,Good quality but it came too small.,53830,3
53830,I usually wear 2X.,53830,3
53830,I can still wear it so it is just a little too small.,53830,3
53831,A little on the flimsy side.,53831,3
53831,"The mask was well made, although it has no back to it.",53831,3
53831,"The actual costume was really thin, but it worked as a halloween costume.",53831,3
53831,Leg pieces ripped when I tried to take it off at the end of the night.,53831,3
53832,"To be one size, Its really small",53832,3
53833,cute for a kid very small,53833,3
53834,"I dislike the fact that the material is shiny, more satin-like instead of cotton.",53834,3
53835,ordered a small... the skirt is PERFECT but the top is EXTREMELY small & i am only a C cup... cheap price so i can't complain too much... will pair skirt with different top,53835,3
53836,I ordered a medium but the fit was more like a small.,53836,3
53836,Pretty nice quality though,53836,3
53837,Item was too big and did not bend to my body so you could see it through my clothes.,53837,3
53837,"However, the company is very nice and professional and refunded for my issue.",53837,3
53839,"Cheaply made material, doesn't really stretch as a bodysuit would.",53839,3
53839,"Won't buy again, too short for a normal sized woman inthe torso, it's probably made for Asian people which can be short in the waist.",53839,3
53840,One of the small stones around the center stone fell out a week after receiving the product.,53840,3
53841,"colors are bright (which is good), fabric is very thin and cheap (which is bad), you can't unbutton a button without threads ripping (which is terrible).",53841,3
53841,obviously made as quickly and cheaply as possible in who knows what kind of working conditions.,53841,3
53842,"I love the shirt, but the seams came out the first day I wore it.",53842,3
53842,Had to have the seems redone.,53842,3
53843,Love the product but runs WAY to big!,53843,3
53844,Not what I expected will not purchase again,53844,3
53845,"Fit as expected....Cheaply made, but you get whst you pay for.",53845,3
53845,Bought it for the style.,53845,3
53846,"So far it seems to be doing a good job holding my watch in place and is reasonably comfortable, but the materials seem a little cheap & thin.",53846,3
53846,"I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected a slightly sturdier quality fabric, and I don't foresee this band lasting all that well.",53846,3
53847,This jacket is made of very cheap material.,53847,3
53847,Really I would say this jacket is costume quality.,53847,3
53847,The material just feels very rough.,53847,3
53847,"Along with the cheap material, the top button on my blazer was sewn on upside down.",53847,3
53847,Now you are probably wondering why I gave the jacket three stars even though the material is poor and buttons were sewn on upside down.,53847,3
53847,"Well I will say that the jacket's design is one of a kind, and even though the material may be cheap the overall jacket was stitched well and unlike other Asian blazers I have purchased, it did not have any loose strings or material hanging anywhere.",53847,3
53847,I have received blazers from other sellers that have been far worse than this one.,53847,3
53847,I originally needed the blazer for a role in a short film.,53847,3
53847,Once again I will say that I like the look of the jacket just not the material it is made of.,53847,3
53847,Overall all I'm neither happy nor sad about the purchase just indifferent.,53847,3
53847,The jacket did fit me perfectly.,53847,3
53847,If you are considering purchasing this blazer make sure you order two sizes up.,53847,3
53847,"I will probably not buy another one of these blazers or encourage a friend either, unless the price comes down.",53847,3
53847,I have attached a picture of what the jacket looks like with my costume.,53847,3
53848,the bust area is too small for fully endowed women,53848,3
53849,Suit is not exactly what I was expecting.,53849,3
53849,Colors are different then what the image shows.,53849,3
53849,Much brighter and more intense then the images.,53849,3
53849,Also design is slightly different.,53849,3
53849,I ordered according to the chart and it fit ok.,53849,3
53849,I'll probably keep it cause of the price.,53849,3
53850,Need big thighs to fill leg holes .,53850,3
53851,Really cute but runs very small.,53851,3
53852,a few of them have already broken :(,53852,3
53854,this item is not cut or finished as it appears in the picture.,53854,3
53855,It was nice a little small.,53855,3
53856,"Other than the fact that my cape is one sided due to a missing button, which I can easily fix, this dress fit like I hoped it would.",53856,3
53857,Pretty dress liked the pockets the material was not what I expected.,53857,3
53858,"However, it does not fit as expected and arrived too late despite the extra shipping I paid.",53858,3
53858,Still got to use the dress for another dance but she missed the Navy Ball.,53858,3
53859,But it's awkward & requires maintenance to keep it up- as pretty much all clothes do during pregnancy.,53859,3
53859,I don't use it much- I'd rather wear a dress that doesn't require accoutrements or pulling to keep it up.,53859,3
53860,I liked this shirt.,53860,3
53860,Wished my chest would have fit it.,53860,3
53860,"I ordered the XL in hopes that it would, but I still couldn't.",53860,3
53860,Super cute shirt though and length appeared to be like shown.,53860,3
53860,Gave it to my Sister In Law...she's excited about it.,53860,3
53861,more of a size 6 month than 9 mo.,53861,3
53862,Not as many little gold balls in one earring as the other.,53862,3
53862,It is noticeable but for the price it's not bad and yes I will still wear them.,53862,3
53863,The dress was gorgeous out of the bag just wish their size chart was accurate.,53863,3
53863,Had to send it back because it ran way small.,53863,3
53864,Sizes much smaller in real,53864,3
53865,"Product looks like picture, only issue was it did not fit in shoulders and arms.",53865,3
53865,"Person I bought it for is a size large, but it looks like this will be passed on to her more petite friend instead.",53865,3
53867,The style and funtionslity is very nice.,53867,3
53867,I haven't used it on a trip yet so I do not know how it will hold out.,53867,3
53867,The only issue was I ordered the color brown based on the picture but the actual color that arrived was a Carmel light brown.,53867,3
53867,I didn't return it because the other color options didn't meet my needs but would have liked the darker color you should change the picture.,53867,3
53868,I only gave these shoes 3 stars because the shoelaces had to be replaced.,53868,3
53868,The shoes would come untied after about 30 minutes so I used the laces from my old shoes.,53868,3
53868,It does not sound like a big deal but when you pay 80 dollars for a pair of shes you should not have to change the laces right off.,53868,3
53869,"Looks great, thank you.",53869,3
53870,"to small, however customer service took care of problem.",53870,3
53871,"Not as malleable as I'd like, but they do the job of holding the hairtie in place.",53871,3
53872,large is more like a small/medium.,53872,3
53872,"I'm 165lbs 5'4"" and a 36 C. If Only the shirt was made a little larger in the chest area.",53872,3
53872,Very cute shirt and nice material!,53872,3
53873,"Given I read the reviews on the size of this product I ordered accordingly, but it was still small.",53873,3
53874,"Pendent is great, chain was nearly broken and way shorter then I thought it was",53874,3
53875,"This is an adult costume at its geekiest and cheapest, but, hey, it's an inexpensive way to dress up for Halloween.",53875,3
53875,It's basically a tube with the Crayola crayon front in thin Neoprene and a nondescript back in see-through thin fabric.,53875,3
53875,"The crayon ""paper"" color is more of a greenish yellow than a green, although the borders and included hat are as green as pictured.",53875,3
53875,"I wear a women's size 10, and that seems to be the limit of the adult small/medium.",53875,3
53875,The hat is REALLY tall.,53875,3
53875,I consider this costume to be disposable due to both its price and cheap construction.,53875,3
53875,-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann,53875,3
53876,the center stone fell out right away.,53876,3
53877,Love this product it does makes you swet a lot but by the 3 month one side ripe n I had to say good by.,53877,3
53878,It said waterproof on the ad but when I received  it it says water recestance there is a difference this shows misrepresentation,53878,3
53879,Missing 2 rhinestones that weren't anywhere to be found.,53879,3
53879,I need it by tomorrow so there is no time to send back for a new one.,53879,3
53879,Guess I'll have to go spend more money and buy replacement rhinestones.,53879,3
53880,"i'm full figured, it wasn't long enough in the torso, dragging the chest down so I returned...otherwise seemed like a decent quality for price",53880,3
53881,"Too small, ordered size 5 but it is for 3 years.",53881,3
53882,These things are made for small breasted women.,53882,3
53882,I wear a DDD but I'm small everywhere else so its tough getting  a top to fit with its bottom.,53882,3
53882,"I got an extra large, and I still have some breast sticking out, but the bottoms were  too big.",53882,3
53882,I  would love it if it fit on me.,53882,3
53882,Recommended for average breast.,53882,3
53883,This dress is very very hip hugging and quite low- it is flattering but the material is so thin so I wasn't able to wear it without a slip underneath.,53883,3
53883,It looked more like nightgown material and for that reason I wasn't a big fan.,53883,3
53883,I guess it depends what you are going to wear it for.,53883,3
53884,This ankle bracelet was cute but only lasted a couple days because the thing broke apart.,53884,3
53884,It was no surprise because the price was cheap so I couldn't expect the product to be any different.,53884,3
53885,I loved the bracelet!,53885,3
53885,Clasp broke on second time wearing it,53885,3
53886,Way smaller than I thought it would be,53886,3
53887,I was disappointed that the background color is a washed out pink as opposed to the vibrant pink pictured.,53887,3
53887,And the size should really not be described as large when it is merely average in size.,53887,3
53887,"Case should do a good job protecting my smaller frames, though.",53887,3
53888,"I ordered adult med, it was way to small it was more like a youth med!",53888,3
53888,It took forever to get!,53888,3
53888,So I gave it away to young girl!,53888,3
53888,Other than that it was a very nice hoodie!,53888,3
53889,I loved these sunglasses at first.,53889,3
53889,"But, after a lot of wear, the plastic began to crack.",53889,3
53889,I had to super glue it to prevent it from completely snapping off.,53889,3
53889,I wish the plastic was of higher-quality.,53889,3
53890,These are too small.,53890,3
53890,How I send them back and get a bigger pair?,53890,3
53891,suit fit every place but my bust.,53891,3
53891,"my measurements are bust 48, waist 34, hips 42 and i am 5 feet 4 inches tall.",53891,3
53891,loved it besides that!,53891,3
53892,"I like this product but I thought the items would be regular size, this is a great for travel and trips where space is limited.",53892,3
53893,Super cute dress but the photos deceptive because the cut out at the boobs is a different color orange and it just looked awkward.,53893,3
53893,I returned the dress.,53893,3
53894,"They are okay -without having them appraised, these are likely what is described, but I question that they are what they say they are when the earrings arrived with one loose and the other in a plastic bag.",53894,3
53894,The description says they are in a box and there is a picture of a box.,53894,3
53894,"Unless they mean the brown cardboard box all Amazon stuff ships in, I'm missing a box.",53894,3
53894,Update: Amazon gave me a $15 credit to make up for the missing box.,53894,3
53894,"However, since then, I caught the back on one in my hair and was able to pull it off.",53894,3
53894,The thing went flying and I still haven't been able to find it.,53894,3
53894,"I ordered a new back from amazon thinking that they should fit their own earrings, but they don't.",53894,3
53894,I now have an expensive pair of earrings that I can't wear.,53894,3
53895,didnt fit the best,53895,3
53896,"This shirt came early, which was nice.",53896,3
53896,"I wasn't expecting it to fit well as I am slightly on the heavier side, but it fit better than I thought it would.",53896,3
53896,"Slightly stretchy, which is nice.",53896,3
53896,"However, I'm giving it 3 stars because it is poorly made, loose threads everywhere, and it ripped the second time I wore it.",53896,3
53897,I like the feel.,53897,3
53898,"Very pretty, but runs small",53898,3
53900,The hat fit ok because I ordered up but the strap was still too short.,53900,3
53901,"Top shorter than I like ,fabric is pretty thin and shrinks in wash but comfy",53901,3
53902,It's cute but it's a lot more Caution Cone orange then a tan orange.,53902,3
53903,This is beautiful but the zipper is too hard to close.,53903,3
53903,The zipper is thorn.,53903,3
53903,The fit is also very accurate.,53903,3
53904,"This is pretty see through, really only appropriate as a beach coverup",53904,3
53906,Top recieved has blue and white stripes.,53906,3
53906,with turquoise trim me clip between cups.,53906,3
53906,This isn't an issue for me as I'm pairing this with blue bottoms that has torque ode accent but I want future buyers to be aware.,53906,3
53907,I love the white jade plugs but they were a size 4g while the other two were 6g.,53907,3
53907,Also the purple ones came as just white and I was really disappointed.,53907,3
53908,"So, we really wanted this dress to work because it looks great in the listing pictures, but the thing was way too small and tight.",53908,3
53908,"We first ordered the small, but couldn't get it past hips, so we re-ordered in the medium, but couldn't get it zipped.",53908,3
53908,"And it is short, and she couldn't fill out the top well.",53908,3
53908,"She normally wears XS or Small, but we gave up on it.",53908,3
53908,"She is 5ft, 125lbs, size 3, 34A, so maybe someone leaner would work with this dress.",53908,3
53909,"So far, so good.",53909,3
53909,"Free from defects, strap looks sturdy, shoulder pad is nice.",53909,3
53909,I am concerned the hardware used to connect the strap to briefcase d-rings may be weak.,53909,3
53910,This dress looks way better in the picture than in real life.,53910,3
53910,It is pretty loose and rather transparent.,53910,3
53910,It actually looks a lot like hospital robe.,53910,3
53910,"May be it would do the trick in a different color, but it looks cheap in white.",53910,3
53911,Un color moy oskuro,53911,3
53912,"The top of the stocking is way too small for this to be ""queen size"".",53912,3
53912,I feel like my legs are being strangled.,53912,3
53912,"Other than that, they're fine.",53912,3
53914,Delivered in a week or less.,53914,3
53914,Got this backpack to carry my Fuji camera around...fit perfectly.,53914,3
53914,"However, after a day of wear the strap came off.",53914,3
53915,"I like the color and style, however when I went to try it on it did not go past my knee.",53915,3
53916,There was loose stiching coming out of the package in the arm area and had a hole in the toe after the first time using,53916,3
53918,Quality is not a curated  with the price,53918,3
53919,It was nice quality but I didn't like the style on myself.,53919,3
53919,I returned it with no problems.,53919,3
53920,Still fits & I bought to wear under other blouses so it works ok.,53920,3
53920,It was inexpensive but I won't be buying more,53920,3
53922,boob area a little exposed,53922,3
53923,Love the look and the sun coverage but I've had it for about 4 months and it's already broken at the top.,53923,3
53923,"Also, will shape and bend however it is placed, which is super annoying, but you can always manipulate it to shape it back to its original form.",53923,3
53923,However that is inconvenient and for the price I expected better.,53923,3
53923,"But it is very comfortable, and fits big heads like mine haha.",53923,3
53924,"The set is cheap looking but it was cheap in price, so can't expect much.",53924,3
53924,The pendant's stone was out when I received it.,53924,3
53924,I've super glued it back in and gave it to a young niece.,53924,3
53925,Cute design but sizes seem to run a bit small.,53925,3
53926,"These are okay, but charms can easily come off as plastic is pretty thing and breaks easily.",53926,3
53928,The Good: It's an all leather bag/ backpack for a very reasonable price approx.,53928,3
53928,$25.00 when I purchased it.,53928,3
53928,"You can carry the bag 3 different ways ( handle, shoulder strap, or backpack)The general size is nice not too big or too small.",53928,3
53928,It has good storage pockets inside the backpack.,53928,3
53928,The Bad: The color description is not correct.,53928,3
53928,I ordered the yellow but it's actually a tan color.,53928,3
53928,The top opening is narrow so getting items in and out could prove frustrating.,53928,3
53928,The leather quality is mediocre.,53928,3
53928,Verdict: I'll probably be keeping this bag because it is pretty decent for the price.,53928,3
53928,When I first was thinking about purchasing this bag the price was closer to $60.00.,53928,3
53928,If I would have paid $60.00 I would definitely return it.,53928,3
53928,For $25.00 I'll give it a chance.,53928,3
53929,It's nice but now that I'm wearing it.,53929,3
53929,I feel like it goes better with an actuall child.,53929,3
53929,The package came about a week late and not like it said.,53929,3
53930,Seem very comfortable and light for my three year old but afer a week of wear they are starting to fray and the bottoms are wearing off already.,53930,3
53931,"It is nice soft material - I do like it, but gave 3 stars because it is a little big",53931,3
53932,Im curvy but the fit of this dress was a little bagy,53932,3
53933,My boyfriend is too small for me.,53933,3
53934,bottom always floats up,53934,3
53935,It's a different material than I was expecting.,53935,3
53935,Fits a little larger than was I was hoping.,53935,3
53935,Only tried it on I haven't worn it out yet.,53935,3
53936,The shirt was pretty cute upon arrival.,53936,3
53936,"However, I ordered a small and found it was a tad too tight.",53936,3
53936,The sleeves are pretty small/short.,53936,3
53936,"But I personally like a little bit of a longer sleeve on a tshirt, rather than it be right under the armpit.",53936,3
53936,"Also, the main thing that prompted me to write a review was the fact that the print pretty much faded off after the second time washing it.",53936,3
53936,Probably would not purchase again.,53936,3
53937,"Way too small for my wrist, and I have petite wrists.",53937,3
53937,I was able to attach a longer chain in order to wear it.,53937,3
53937,"For the price its ok, but you get what you pay for.",53937,3
53938,"The shirt is tight but I'll keep it, it is also cut short from the shoulders to the waist.",53938,3
53939,Even with proper washing and no dry,53939,3
53940,"These tights fit me great and smooth my small postpartum pooch,  they're just a little long- I'm 5'2, 130lbs.",53940,3
53940,"BUT, I wore them only once and had a hole in the crotch by the end of the day!",53940,3
53940,"I can stitch the seam up again but sucks because otherwise, these pants fit like a dream.",53940,3
53940,"Not sure if my pair was defective but if it weren't for that hole, I'd give 5 stars.",53940,3
53941,I ordered small but a little big on me.,53941,3
53941,I like the design so I decided to keep it.,53941,3
53942,This robe is warm and great for the winter time.,53942,3
53942,"However, it does fit a bit large.",53942,3
53942,I ordered the small/medium (based on other reviews) and it's still too large for me.,53942,3
53942,I'm 5'3 and petite and this gapes in the front on me.,53942,3
53942,I can never get it tight enough to stay.,53942,3
53942,It also got a hole in the side of it after I had only worn it a few times.,53942,3
53942,"However, I do love this robe as it is so soft/warm.",53942,3
53942,I'll just have the hole sewed up no problem as it looks easy to fix.,53942,3
53942,I would recommend this if it was more fitted.,53942,3
53943,Liked it but it ran small.,53943,3
53945,For the price I wish this skirt were a bit higher quality.,53945,3
53945,"It's felt like in thickness of material, and not much attention was given to the cut.",53945,3
53945,"Cozy, but not flattering.",53945,3
53946,Beautiful necklace however poor quality.,53946,3
53946,The necklace broke for no apparent reason only after two days of wearing it.,53946,3
53947,"Very small can barely read , on the cheap looking side",53947,3
53948,"Sizes are small, but I like the look and feel.",53948,3
53949,"Not the right style for me :/ I'm 24 years old, weighing 110, and I wear a 32dd bra size.",53949,3
53949,"It fits tight around the top half of my boobs but just hangs down from there and kinda makes me look bigger than I am, or atleast that's how I feel.",53949,3
53949,Also I don't really like how the side parts of the lace aren't sewn down.,53949,3
53949,"The material feels good and soft, however I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how it holds up.",53949,3
53949,I will give this to my best friend who is a little bigger than me and update with how it fits her,53949,3
53950,This tank top is not 100% cotton - it's 50/50.,53950,3
53950,"I am only using it for casual wear, but I'm annoyed to be misled.",53950,3
53951,The seller isn't misrepresenting this item at all.,53951,3
53951,"It's a nice size and has plenty of compartments and its very attractive, but it is also super light and flimsy.",53951,3
53951,"The strap is thin and feels cheap, and there is no way to swap it as it is sewed directly to the bag on one side.",53951,3
53951,"Out of the package, all the zippers were half-zipped and had to be forced open then re-zipped.",53951,3
53951,I have zero confidence that the zippers will hold up to regular usage.,53951,3
53951,"Instead of using it as a handbag, I now play to try using it to carry my drawing supplies.",53951,3
53951,I recommend ordering this only as a light duty bag.,53951,3
53952,It was huge for my nose.,53952,3
53952,Maybe just not the right body jewelry for me but it was pretty disappointing.,53952,3
53952,I even bought the smaller gauge 16mm for a smaller ring in general.,53952,3
53952,It's super cute though!,53952,3
53952,So I can't vote either positive or negative.,53952,3
53953,"The quality of the product is really nice, especially for the price that it is.",53953,3
53953,"Although, the sizing goes by Asian sizes, so I recommend you get two sizes larger than what you normally are.",53953,3
53953,"EX: I got a medium because that what I am in America, but with Asian sizing I need an XL.",53953,3
53954,Good for everyday wear,53954,3
53955,expected the holes to be in the front and they were on the side.......,53955,3
53955,But was fully refunded for mistake and got to keep them so they do good BUISNESS,53955,3
53956,This size does not fit anyone over a B cup.,53956,3
53956,Idk how there are so many posts with girls who wear a C and D that say they fit.,53956,3
53956,Most of the time whenever an item says OSFA it really means One Size Only Fits S & M. Just don't buy this if you're a C and above.,53956,3
53956,I'm a 38C and this doesn't even go around my shoulders.,53956,3
53957,"It's a cute shirt and the material is ok, it's a silky feeling shirt that is well made.",53957,3
53957,"It fit as expected but it hung a little funny on me, I'm thinking it will look better as a layering piece with a cute camisole under it.",53957,3
53957,"They do give you a sash thing which just ties around your waist to bring more shape to the shirt, so you can choose to use it or not which gives it some versatility.",53957,3
53958,But it does run somewhat smaller.,53958,3
53958,But it's super cute and I got compliments everywhere I went!,53958,3
53959,I like this top because it is long and made of breathable cotton lycra.,53959,3
53959,"However, my regular bra peeks out of the corners of the square neckline so I had to return it.",53959,3
53960,"Unfortunately, I had to return this product.",53960,3
53960,"The description stated it was a 6, but when it arrived the tag showed it as a 5/6, and it was too small.",53960,3
53960,My son is more of a 6-7 so it was too short and too tight for him.,53960,3
53960,The quality was great and it arrived quickly.,53960,3
53960,The only issue was the size.,53960,3
53961,ran a little small.,53961,3
53961,i am 6 ft and long legs always have this prob.,53961,3
53961,elastic at top kinda wiennie,53961,3
53962,"However, it comes in a plain package without a brand tag.",53962,3
53962,So it's good for your own kids but not great a gift.,53962,3
53963,Cool shirt but very long,53963,3
53964,started ripping at bottom,53964,3
53965,"Cute outfit, but it didn't arrive in time.",53965,3
53967,"This does hold my pants up, but I have to pull it up once in a while, as it gradually slides down the belly.",53967,3
53967,"It's better when you wear it folded over, does not slide down that way, but then my belly gets cold.",53967,3
53968,I really loved these for about 7 uses - but ever since then these have been going downhill.,53968,3
53968,"Like other reviewers, the center sticks great, but the edges are no longer sticking.",53968,3
53968,I followed the instructions that come with the petals for the washing and unfortunately the sides still don't stick.,53968,3
53968,"Bummed these didn't last as long as advertised - they still kind of work, but I'm constantly having to ""restick"" the edges down (so it just looks like I'm groping myself to the untrained eye).",53968,3
53968,I'm adjusting constantly throughout the day.,53968,3
53968,"Going to have to look for a better, longer lasting solution - but these worked great for the first few uses.",53968,3
53969,I love how soft these pants are!,53969,3
53969,"They are quite long, though.",53969,3
53969,"Even with heels, I have already pulled out the back on one seam.",53969,3
53969,"A lot of the threads are getting loose, but to be honest I would still order these again they are soooo comfy while still looking ""tailored!""",53969,3
53970,Cute shirt but very stiff.,53970,3
53970,Instead of being a forgiving jersey type material it is a stiff cotton and makes it a lot more structured than i was expecting which means not really forgiving in the bust area as it has no stretch.,53970,3
53970,cute but not what i expected.,53970,3
53970,If it had been a softer fabric with a little bit of give it would have been perfect,53970,3
53971,"It's a little small, and if you have sensitive skin would not recommend this to you, It is not very comfortable because it is very itchy.",53971,3
53971,It attracts hair like you wouldn't believe.,53971,3
53971,"You may need to hem it, I had to.",53971,3
53971,It's a bit tight.,53971,3
53971,"But it is gorgeous, I can't give it that great of a rating because of the flaws to it.",53971,3
53972,It's cute and looks like the imagine runs extremely small to me.,53972,3
53972,i got a size small and it fits like xx small,53972,3
53973,"The dress was beautiful, however took alot of work to make it usable.",53973,3
53973,The zipper already had a few teeth missing and kept getting stuck on the material which was hard to close even when the dress wasn't being worn.,53973,3
53973,Took two extra people to close the dress up without breaking the zipper.,53973,3
53973,The dress also came super wrinkly (which is expected from ordering online ) but perhaps a little nicer packaging instead of just shoving it In a bag.,53973,3
53973,"After steam cleaning it, and cutting off loose strings from the dress, it was beautiful thougj, and didn't even need a bra.",53973,3
53973,Gave a nice natural lift to the girls!,53973,3
53974,I use it as a shirt if your a medium get an extra large,53974,3
53975,"One was great, the soles on the other pair fell off within weeks.",53975,3
53977,The sizing is for larger women.,53977,3
53977,I'm a little less then  110 pounds and I'm swimming in it .,53977,3
53978,The cape is mink fur interwoven to the net mesh below.,53978,3
53978,I generally wear a size 6 and sometime a small 8.,53978,3
53978,This cape fits me pretty well so it is definitely on the smaller side.,53978,3
53978,The fur collar is also smaller and not as wide as it is shown in the picture.,53978,3
53978,The item is still a beautiful cape that should keep me warm over an evening gown in the winter time.,53978,3
53978,I ordered the black and red one and I think the red one actually looks nicer but the black should go with everything.,53978,3
53979,It's not accurate with the size but it ok,53979,3
53981,I liked the sweater but it wasn't flattering when closed and tied with the belt.,53981,3
53982,"A year ago I bought a shirt in light gray for a Halloween costume that I ended up loving so much, I have worn it sense.",53982,3
53982,"I sized up for it, and it was perfectly ""too big"".",53982,3
53982,"After reading the reviews back then, I thought I was just lucky.",53982,3
53982,"Just recently I got a job that requires wearing a smock over our clothes, so I figured I would order different colors of the same size for work.",53982,3
53982,Well I got them yesterday.,53982,3
53982,Each shirt (including the one from a year ago) fits differently and is a different cut.,53982,3
53982,I have a total of five shirts.,53982,3
53982,One is super big.,53982,3
53982,One has longer sleeves.,53982,3
53982,One has a cinched side.,53982,3
53982,And NONE of them fit quite like the other.,53982,3
53982,"I made the decision to keep them because of what I'll be using them for, but seriously it's a roll of the dice as far as sizing and cut goes.",53982,3
53982,"All of the shirts fit me, but all look different.",53982,3
53983,Great pants but sizes run small.,53983,3
53984,I got them a little too big but washed them and they'll be fine.,53984,3
53984,Love the inside they're so soft.,53984,3
53984,And I bought them because they have the elastic at the ankle.,53984,3
53984,"Being short 5'4"" I need something that will not slide under my heel.",53984,3
53984,They do fit as if they are men's sweats though.,53984,3
53984,The waist being a little larger and fitting perfectly throughout the legs.,53984,3
53984,Will need to either shrink them or find a way to cinch the waist,53984,3
53986,Product is as expected and at a good value,53986,3
53987,This shirt is pretty especially in the black but runs large.,53987,3
53987,Gave the colored away and I will wear the black one with tights.,53987,3
53987,Great shirt for the price.,53987,3
53987,It is also very comfortable and soft.,53987,3
53988,It's small but pretty stretchy.,53988,3
53988,The zipper in the front is very itchy though.,53988,3
53989,I like it but I just hate that it doesn't fit me well.,53989,3
53990,Fit everywhere but the length,53990,3
53991,This dress was cute but way too see through and big for someone who is 4'11 and 120 lbs.,53991,3
53992,cute design but fabric scratchy,53992,3
53993,Shirt is too small.,53993,3
53994,"So far it seems ok, but the ink for the lettering seems pretty thin and I need to see how it fairs after more washing, I will update this after I wear it more.",53994,3
53995,These are not everyday undies.,53995,3
53995,"They fit on the small side, making your booty look nice but not the most comfortable if you're wearing them all day.",53995,3
53995,They can also be a little itchy.,53995,3
53995,"But, they get the job done, if the job involves looking sexy!",53995,3
53996,"I love it, but it's MASSIVE on me.",53996,3
53996,I bought a medium when I should have gotten an XXS!,53996,3
53996,I ended up giving it away to my size 16 friend who absolutely loves it.,53996,3
53996,"There's nothing at all wrong with the quality and was super cute, but the sizing issue needs to be addressed.",53996,3
53997,They fit great and come with a cute storage bag.,53997,3
53997,"They'll be good for layering in the winter, just not what I was expecting.",53997,3
53997,The back pocket is very small for the size of the zipper.,53997,3
53997,"I was expecting my phone to fit, its not even close.",53997,3
53997,I prefer a more matte material in leggings so the material isn't ideal.,53997,3
53998,Cute top but ill fitting.,53998,3
53998,It's like the material across the back is too small.,53998,3
53998,Collar doesn't sit up on your neck... it falls back.,53998,3
53998,Lots of static cling.,53998,3
53999,I typically wear a size 14/16 and ordered this thinking the top would pair well with some of my skirted bottoms.,53999,3
53999,The bottoms that came with it fit perfectly but I have to adjust the straps as tight as they'll go and they still fall off.,53999,3
53999,The bottom of the back does not cling to my back and slides down.,53999,3
53999,"This runs large, so plan accordingly.",53999,3
53999,It's bright in color and really pretty on!,53999,3
54000,I've had this for quite some time and it was really great until the steel boned parts began to come out.,54000,3
54000,All of them have fallen out and now the bad is useless,54000,3
54002,Its gorgeous but too big,54002,3
54004,Runs 2 sizes smaller.,54004,3
54005,"Fits somewhat small, not well made.",54005,3
54006,"ok, I am using it.now",54006,3
54007,Well made but Im 5'3 and the torso is to small,54007,3
54009,Was a hole in shoulder when we received item.,54009,3
54009,Not very good quality at all.,54009,3
54009,Thin material but it is soft.,54009,3
54009,My daughter is happy with it after I fixed the hole.,54009,3
54010,I wear an adult medium t-shirt and had to order this as a 2XL based on the reviews on the band's website.,54010,3
54010,"It fits well, but the sizes are definitely misleading.",54010,3
54010,The shirt itself is very soft and true to color.,54010,3
54011,"A bit too narrow for my foot, although generally I love this shoe.",54011,3
54012,I am petite; it was too long so it was returned.,54012,3
54012,Appeared to be well made.,54012,3
54013,"Canvas is good quality, but the straps keep coming unbuckled every time you set it down and pick it back up.",54013,3
54013,I'll keep it and maybe add a little super glue to the buckles.,54013,3
54014,I love the concept of this bra and the material is very nice and soft.,54014,3
54014,For me those arm cell phone bands don't work.,54014,3
54014,"I got an XL which is my normal sports bra size, it's too small for me.",54014,3
54014,"I still use it, but it's very tight.",54014,3
54014,Don't recommend for DD cups.,54014,3
54015,I got the black one (I can't remember what size) and it came smelling like dye.,54015,3
54015,I set it to the side thinking I would return it but I forgot about it.,54015,3
54015,"I recently found the top and looked at it again, and after being left in the air, the smell went away.",54015,3
54015,"It was still quite wrinkled, but it is pretty cute, or at least it will be once I steam it and get the wrinkles out.",54015,3
54015,Conflicted feelings about the elastic at the bottom of the top.,54015,3
54015,"Although I can't remember what size I ordered, I think I got a small after reading the reviews that it ran large (I am usually a S/M), and it definitely fit like a medium shirt that is supposed to be oversized.",54015,3
54016,Nice shirt but runs really small,54016,3
54017,I bought this purse only to wear with my mermaid costume (which has a green tail).,54017,3
54017,"It goes perfectly with it, and it is the color I expected.",54017,3
54017,I don't think it is a purse to wear on a regular basis.,54017,3
54017,"It is very cheap looking, but I really wasn't expecting more than I got.",54017,3
54018,"Cute gown, but a little bulky for me to sleep in.",54018,3
54018,"I am 5'8"" and it is very short for me.",54018,3
54018,Material is thicker than most sleepwear.,54018,3
54019,Not the best hat I've ever seen.,54019,3
54020,"IT'S DONE ME WONDERS AFTER 3 KIDS NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE IM ALREADY NATURALLY CURVY BUT THIS CINCHER ENHANCES YOUR CINCHED WAIST LOOK.",54020,3
54020,"I DON'T NEED IT FOR WAIST TRAINING, AS I STATED BEFORE THAT I HAD 3 KIDS AND I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO BOND MY AB MUSCULES TOGETHER (THIS IS ALSO USEFUL FOR POST-PARTUM BINDING BTW) THE ONLY ISSUE IS IT'S SIZE IS NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE CHART.",54020,3
54020,IT IS A BIT SMALLER THAN THE ACTUAL SIZE IT GOES BY.,54020,3
54020,"I RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE AND CINCHED IN, THEN I SUGGEST YOU GO UP A SIZE.",54020,3
54020,"ALSO (LITTLE CONFESSION) I HAVE MOMMY STRETCH MARKS WHICH IRRATATED MY STOMACH AND MADE ME ITCH, SO THE FRICTION AGAINST MY STRETCH MARKS AND THE FABRIC IN THE INNER PART OF THIS WAIST TRAINER DOES NOT DO ME JUSTICE.",54020,3
54020,"I SUGGEST MOTHERS APPLY A FIRMING, SLIMMING, OR REGULAR BODY CREAM TO YOUR TUMMY AND SARAN WRAP IT FIRST THEN APPLY THIS WAIST TRAINER FOR THE BEST AND LESS IRRITABLE RESULTS AND BE THE QUEENS THAT YOU ARE!",54020,3
54020,"STAY BEAUTIFUL

54021,Although I had mixed feelings it's definitely a sexy suit.,54021,3
54021,The bottoms are not the same shape as the photo.,54021,3
54021,"If you zoom in you'll notice the fabric is scrunched, that is the only way to wear these bottoms.",54021,3
54021,"The fabric is shiny and soft, i would recommend hand washing.",54021,3
54022,The outside of the shirt is kind of a weird material.,54022,3
54022,The sweater is kind of short.,54022,3
54022,It needs to be a little longer in length.,54022,3
54024,Good pair of sunglasses however the frame is a little heavy.,54024,3
54024,But for the money they are great!,54024,3
54025,It would be a 5 star product if the zipper stopped jamming around the corner.,54025,3
54026,"Kinda see through, runs a little bit small",54026,3
54028,I did return it for a larger size.,54028,3
54028,"The chest cups are very small, and I am NOT large chested.",54028,3
54028,I am a 36 B and the medium was too small.,54028,3
54028,I am returning it for a large.,54028,3
54028,The rest of the suit fit fine and I'm hoping the large is not too big in other areas.,54028,3
54028,"EDIT, bought a large, chest part still too small!",54028,3
54028,I am a 34 B!,54028,3
54028,"IT's not padded or anything, it's just cut way too small.",54028,3
54028,"Also, the white liner shows badly.",54028,3
54028,I returned it too.,54028,3
54031,Its longer than expected i had to get ot shorten...but i do like this dress,54031,3
54032,Get Giro or Shimano they are better in quality.,54032,3
54032,It depends on your budget tough.,54032,3
54033,"It wasn't what I expected and the torso of the shirt is a bit short, but it's nice.",54033,3
54034,Unfortunately I didn't think about the shirt being able to stretch a little and got a size too big for me.,54034,3
54034,"even so, after observing the top, I realized even if I got a smaller size the straps would have been too long for me.",54034,3
54035,the feeling of it was funny,54035,3
54036,Burgandy a bit tighter than the green.,54036,3
54037,Although this dress was suppose to have altered it came still too big.,54037,3
54039,It is nice but I Expected  it would be a little bit more lean on the body,54039,3
54041,great swim suit very bright and pretty but the top wasn't very wide vertically and the bottoms were a little smaller than i thought they would be since i ordered her pants size.,54041,3
54042,A bit smaller than expected,54042,3
54043,Great concept but the shirt fit like a tee shirt and did not hang off the shoulder or flow as it looks in the picture.,54043,3
54043,I returned mine with no issues.,54043,3
54043,Great shirt design but it didn't meet my expectations at all :(,54043,3
54044,Me and my boyfriend ordered the same size (by referring to the size converter) but when it comes it happens to be bigger for him.,54044,3
54044,Too large to him to put and keep it on his finger.,54044,3
54044,"We love those rings in spite of the size issue but my man has to keep it on a necklace, not that great.",54044,3
54045,The material is heavier than I expected.,54045,3
54045,When I opened it it looked more like a dress.,54045,3
54046,It could use an elastic band below the breast as mine feel like they are falling out!,54046,3
54047,way smaller than it should have been,54047,3
54048,Not for baby's that crawl a lot!,54048,3
54048,They twist and slide off of my sons feet .,54048,3
54048,They are very soft and fit his feet as expected just won't stay on .,54048,3
54050,Looked great but too long in the mid section,54050,3
54051,"it took an iron to get the wrinkles out from packaging, I haven't worn it more than once.",54051,3
54052,It fits well but it's just a little smaller than expected!,54052,3
54052,"It clips at the bottom, which I thought was kind of odd, but overall I absolutely love it!",54052,3
54052,I'll definitely be getting more in different colors.,54052,3
54053,The shoes fit and no one cannot wear them all day.,54053,3
54053,The straps are useless and I see no reason why have them.,54053,3
54053,"Somehow, I cannot seem to see how they connect as I have to pieces that the strap suppose to go through.",54053,3
54053,The buckle and some other thing.,54053,3
54053,"The packet that came with it called ""Meibao"" I believe that is for the back ankle support.",54053,3
54053,I wouldn't have known if I didn't look at the diagram on the back because everything else is written in another language.,54053,3
54053,"Overall, they are okay.",54053,3
54053,Be sure to have some flats with you because they aren't meant for standing or walking.,54053,3
54053,"Just for a fashion statement, however, they are okay.",54053,3
54053,Something different for me.,54053,3
54054,It is very smelly.,54054,3
54054,I think it was stored in a damp musty place.,54054,3
54054,I am still airing it but it should be okay in a week or two.,54054,3
54055,They catch easily on a towel or shirt,54055,3
54056,Affordable but great quality!,54056,3
54056,My only complaint is my daughter currently fits snuggly in 18-24 mo.,54056,3
54056,so we bought 2T as well to give her more room.,54056,3
54056,The 18-24mo goes over her head great but the 2T barely fits over her head and she cries every time.,54056,3
54056,She has a fairly small head too!,54056,3
54056,Just don't know how that sizing is backwards.,54056,3
54058,"I am normally a small, I ordered a medium in case I got pregnant when I had to wear it.",54058,3
54058,I am 5'6 and the dress bearly comes to the ground and the waist fit perfect.,54058,3
54058,The gold chain around the neck is also a stretchy metal so when you move in anyway it pinches your skin.,54058,3
54058,I ended up removing this and putting In a ribbon instead.,54058,3
54058,I wouldn't buy another one but it did its job for the 1 time I had to wear it,54058,3
54059,This is definitely not haute couture.,54059,3
54059,"The hem isn't quite perfectly even, and neither are some of the buttons.",54059,3
54059,The fabric is shirt-thin.,54059,3
54059,But I bought it as part of a costume for a country-themed ice skating/dance show and it will definitely do the trick for the price.,54059,3
54059,"It's very flowy so there's plenty of flexibility for kicks, splits and all other dance moves.",54059,3
54060,It was some what small and you could see through the shirt.,54060,3
54060,You must wear a tank unless you are going for the bra look.,54060,3
54061,"First of all, they sent me the wrong color.",54061,3
54061,I ordered it in cream and they sent me taupe.,54061,3
54061,"I didn't exchange it because it was actually the other color I was considering, and it's still a nice basic color.",54061,3
54061,I like it because it holds a lot of cards and it's not too bulky.,54061,3
54061,I can just throw it into my backpack or purse.,54061,3
54061,"It's pretty good quality, but I wish there was a coin compartment and it's already stained (although that might be my fault for throwing it around).",54061,3
54061,"All in all, it's not the best, but it's cheap and gets the job done!",54061,3
54062,I bought a size medium at first which fit perfect after giving birth but then it fit big so I bought a small and now I feel that the small is not even tight enough it fits somewhat too big and I'm 5'3 weighing 174lbs.,54062,3
54062,Can anyone recommend a smaller one that will fit tighter?,54062,3
54063,I like the suit but even at a 4x is was too small.,54063,3
54064,I love the look.,54064,3
54064,Purse is greatbut wallet doesnt last at all.don't putchange in it or fill it too full or it comes un done quicker,54064,3
54065,The pouch is quite small,54065,3
54066,i read the reviews and ordered up and it was a mistake.,54066,3
54066,definitely would have been better off with a medium instead of a large.,54066,3
54067,"I'm 5'7"" and 150lbs.",54067,3
54067,It fit good but it was s bit too loose.,54067,3
54068,"okay, itchy fabric, too small",54068,3
54069,My mom wears a medium everything and this is too small,54069,3
54070,"Really dip beanie, I got TONS of compliments...",54070,3
54070,"But unfortunately the ""pins"" fall off, I've had a good 4 of them fall off already.",54070,3
54070,One fell off the second I first put it on too,54070,3
54071,"They look like mens sizing since it so wide and long, other than that they okay.",54071,3
54072,Had to layer these on top of a second pair that was bought from another vendor on AMazon but turned out to be the exact same product.,54072,3
54072,"Super fun and looks good, but too think to wear solo.",54072,3
54072,Wear over another pair of leggins.,54072,3
54072,The fabric is thin and nice to the touch though.,54072,3
54072,I'll wear these just running along because they're interesting,54072,3
54074,I received  the wrong size.,54074,3
54074,other than that it is good material and a very nice comfy dress.,54074,3
54074,I tried it on and it looks nice.,54074,3
54074,It was a little too short being that I got the wrong size and the sides have these hanging bags on the hips that I didn't like.,54074,3
54075,Not as long as the picture.,54075,3
54075,I'm 5ft talk and it's full lengh (comes down to ankles) which is okay for me but considerably shorter on someone taller.,54075,3
54075,Large fits very snug.,54075,3
54076,Overall nice glasses however they were not the correct size and we're very tight around my face.,54076,3
54076,I'm returning the glasses unfortunately.,54076,3
54077,Buy about two sizes bigger than needed for sure.,54077,3
54078,It's a really cute bathing suit but just don't think it flatters my very large chest (36 G) well.,54078,3
54079,Keeping in mind this is a Halloween costume dress.,54079,3
54079,"the collar and cuff are gray , not white.",54079,3
54079,it is a poly fiber and light weight.,54079,3
54079,"do get a size up, unless you really want a tight fit.",54079,3
54079,we got a size L and the measurements on it are : length from neckline in back to bottom of hem is 31 inches.,54079,3
54079,armpit to armpit across the front of the dress lying flat is 18.5 inches.,54079,3
54079,hip area across front lying flat is 19.5 inches.,54079,3
54079,the sleeves from armpit area to end of white cuff is 15.5 inches.,54079,3
54079,the dress has stretch to it and the color is the same poly fabric.,54079,3
54079,there is a loop and button at the top back to close neckline.,54079,3
54079,the bottom hem is short so you cant let it out.,54079,3
54079,its is about as thin as tee shirt material but in a synthetic fiber.,54079,3
54079,I would suggest this not be washed in water as your black will probably run.,54079,3
54079,you can not beat the price for a simple black dress for costume.,54079,3
54082,too much pressure on the end of big toe.,54082,3
54082,"I used the technique of measuring the actual length of my foot, but they are still too small.",54082,3
54083,"If you have a somewhat large chest, it may not look as cute as it does on the picture.",54083,3
54083,"Maybe for that reason and I'm only 5' tall, I looked pregnant in it.",54083,3
54083,It's really a cute dress but maybe more for someone taller and evenly proportioned than me.,54083,3
54084,I thought is the material was too thin and required more special washing instructions than I wanted to give it.,54084,3
54085,"Cute shirt, nice style but way too small.",54085,3
54085,Size chart is inaccurate.,54085,3
54086,Cute shirt but runs very small...I take a size 2-4 and the medium was almost too snug.,54086,3
54087,"It's very pretty, but I don't think it would bounce if I dropped it:(",54087,3
54088,Very cute vest however two sizes too small,54088,3
54089,Fits smaller than expected,54089,3
54090,Run big now having to find other shoes that fit right.,54090,3
54090,But kept them for later,54090,3
54091,"i ordered a kids one too, the kids one is bigger than this one",54091,3
54092,It's thinner than I expected but that was ok.,54092,3
54092,"I'm 5'2.5"" (yes the half inch matters!)",54092,3
54092,all reviewers with similar weights and height ordered the medium and advised against sizing small.,54092,3
54092,And those who ordered small said the shoulders were tight.,54092,3
54092,So I ordered a medium!,54092,3
54092,I wish I'd ordered a small.,54092,3
54092,It's a little looser and baggier than I would've preferred.,54092,3
54092,"The waist ties do help a little but if you have the jacket unzipped, the cinching doesn't stay so you have to knot it at the grommet openings to how cinched you prefer.",54092,3
54092,"It hits right at the bottom of my butt cheeks, waist tie hits at the waist and the hood is a nice depth, not shallow with risk to fall down as you walk (I hate that with other jackets!).",54092,3
54092,Just wish I ordered a small but having it tailored might be cheaper than returning and exchanging.,54092,3
54092,"It arrived super fast in 3 days, not the week and a half it was slated!",54092,3
54093,Did hold up well.,54093,3
54094,"This is beautiful jewelry, but just too big in my small nose.",54094,3
54095,I would need 1 or 2 sizes smaller.,54095,3
54095,I need to return this item.,54095,3
54096,Purchased will fit if I don't breath needed a size up.,54096,3
54098,"I got XXL it says will fit 16-18 size which normally fits Me, but it was too small!",54098,3
54098,"But the outfit did cumm with an apron, headpiece and neck tie that I am able to use with a different maids outfit that I have, so I like that!",54098,3
54099,"The sizing guide said I should order and XL but the dress was so incredibly tight around my breasts, I think a 2XL would have been the proper fit for me.",54099,3
54099,Would be fine if you have a very small chest.,54099,3
54099,Wish it would have fit as I loved the rest of it.,54099,3
54099,Has to return it.,54099,3
54100,"The skirt is very pretty, but it was too tight.",54100,3
54100,I normally wear a size 6 so I don't know how it could be considered one size fits all.,54100,3
54101,It looks great but it comes from China so you should get a size bigger than usual,54101,3
54102,"the print is great, just the size is super snug...",54102,3
54102,"It can be a go to sleep shirt, but out in public...",54102,3
54103,"They weren't quite what I expected, but they are warm for the winter.",54103,3
54104,Don't like how it fits or feels.,54104,3
54104,Material feels very rough,54104,3
54105,"I'm 5'5"", roughly 125 lbs, and this skirt didn't fit as perfectly as I imagined.",54105,3
54105,"The waist is elastic so it adjusts and can be worn higher or lower, but it still gave me a small muffin top.",54105,3
54105,"I could have made it work if it really mattered, but be aware it runs small.",54105,3
54105,"Other than that, the fabric and flow and swirl of the skirt was really attractive,",54105,3
54106,"Received it today, I'm concerned about a few things.",54106,3
54106,1- the size was ridiculously small.,54106,3
54106,"I ordered a small, and I can easily latch it onto the last hook and still have some wiggle room.",54106,3
54106,2- my concern is the latex.,54106,3
54106,"I'm interested in seeing if this is actually going to train my waist like a steel corset would, or if it's just going to make me sweat out a ton of water weight giving it an effect of a smaller waist until I drink a couple glasses of water.",54106,3
54106,Reallllly wish it would have fit so I could check out this new trend!!,54106,3
54106,"If you're already athletic, and in shape I'd say size down for sure.",54106,3
54107,"I really did like this design, but unfortunately I listened too much to other reviews and ordered a size up.",54107,3
54107,"For me, I needed my regular size.",54107,3
54107,I did return this item and re-ordered the correct size.,54107,3
54108,A decent quality for the price but the wig cap is very small.,54108,3
54108,It's difficult to put in and does not stay in place or cover the natural hair well due to its small size.,54108,3
54109,Starting to come undone it's been like a month since I got it,54109,3
54110,love the look and color of the dress but the size chart is off you need 1 or 2 sizes biger thin norm.,54110,3
54111,Size chart doesn't specify men or women's size.,54111,3
54111,So way to big for a women so gave away.,54111,3
54112,DON'T LIKE IT THAT MUCH--GIVING AWAY TO SOME FRIEND,54112,3
54113,Nice top not very flattering for those of us that like to eat.,54113,3
54114,Sold as a large but is the same size as the medium black one I previously purchased.,54114,3
54114,If I had wanted a purse more than a large tote this would work.,54114,3
54115,front too small and back too long.,54115,3
54115,just an oddly it bathing suit overall.,54115,3
54116,They are comfortable but they are just aviator glasses with stickers on them.,54116,3
54116,After the first day sweating in the sun at a music festival one of the stickers unstuck.,54116,3
54116,The frame is a little too stiff too so they don't unfold easily,54116,3
54118,Looks good and arrived very fast only thing i don't like is the panels with the buttons etc which are very flimsy and on mine the chest panel is almost at an angle to make it look diamond shaped - not square!,54118,3
54118,Hopefully it makes it through at least 2 parties!,54118,3
54118,Still ok for the price though.,54118,3
54119,Shorter and thinner than expected.,54119,3
54119,"A bit too tight, but not bad.",54119,3
54119,Also much shearer than expected - my wife will always wear it over another shirt.,54119,3
54120,"nice short, but does not fit athletic built men very well unless you have a super bonkers ass - and the front crotch is droopy, not as shown in the model picture, FYI",54120,3
54121,It fits as expected .,54121,3
54121,But the strings on front is actually on side of pants .idk why but it's okay!,54121,3
54122,"They fit fine, until the first wash.  Then, despite being VERY careful in the laundry, they shrink to a smaller size.",54122,3
54123,Was a mess coming out of the package.,54123,3
54124,"The length was perfect for I am 5""9.",54124,3
54124,My hip is 42 and waist 30.,54124,3
54124,I try to see if I could get a xl but that size wasn't in the option.,54124,3
54124,I ended up with a large.,54124,3
54124,So as a result it sticks close to me...wanted a little more room so I could expand into it.,54124,3
54125,Wasn't what i expected.,54125,3
54126,This product is definitely made for a plus size girl who's pear shaped.,54126,3
54126,"The top was ok, but the arms were baggy and the hips were huge.",54126,3
54126,It also has a very short torso.,54126,3
54126,"So, basically, if you're built like a short pear/hourglass shape, this may be for you.",54126,3
54126,"If you have a large chest but smaller waist or hips, this will fit weird.",54126,3
54126,"That being said, I always have problems with plus size clothing fitting in the hips.",54126,3
54126,"The quality was nice, though.",54126,3
54126,"It gets 3 stars for quality, -2 for only fitting traditionally ""plus size"" shaped big hip girls.",54126,3
54127,I ended up returning the suit.,54127,3
54127,The color wasn't as bright as I expected it to be.,54127,3
54127,Also the top runs larger than the bottom.,54127,3
54128,"In general, great deal for the money.",54128,3
54128,The fabric is thin and reveals any lumps or bumps underneath.,54128,3
54128,I will need to lose some weight and find some smoothing undergarments to really make it work.,54128,3
54128,"I am 5'10"" and I like the length as it is just over my knees ... an elegant length.",54128,3
54128,If you are in good shape and wear smoothing undergarments - would be fantastic.,54128,3
54129,The sleeves were very tight.,54129,3
54130,"This shirt was shorter than I was hoping, but I wouldn't have wanted to get a bigger size because it's very wide.",54130,3
54130,"Overall, it's kind of cheaply made but cute.",54130,3
54131,"A bit small, these are made for perky girl, with not so much boob!!",54131,3
54132,Bottoms were too small.,54132,3
54132,Is there a way you all can send me the bottoms in a Medium?,54132,3
54133,The material is to thin and transparent to be wearing as a skirt.,54133,3
54134,Bought it for my husband,54134,3
54135,The ring arrived properly packaged.,54135,3
54135,While there was nothing wrong with the ring I didn't like it.,54135,3
54135,The design did not show up very well and it is really plain.,54135,3
54135,I purchased it to wear as a thumb ring but didn't like it but there was not defects in the ring.,54135,3
54136,"Loved this, but you get what you pay for.",54136,3
54137,"bust area too large, dress is made for teens with cleavage",54137,3
54138,The material is awful and very cheap.,54138,3
54138,Like something I could have bought at Ross but at half the price.,54138,3
54138,"The color isn't true to the photos, it is clearly white in the pictures (I have 4 monitors on my desk to compare) and the skirt that I received was blue...how does white become blue again?",54138,3
54139,It didn't rest on my head properly.,54139,3
54140,I purchased because of the overall good customer reviews from C cup women.,54140,3
54140,I need these for my wedding dress as it is backless low cut.,54140,3
54140,"I was very pleased with the adhesiveness however, this is not a good product for full C cup women.",54140,3
54140,by breasts were saggy as if I had no bra on at all.,54140,3
54140,"I did everything right based on the instructions and even the comments from the other reviews, but still the same result.",54140,3
54140,The cup covered just above my nipple - I guess i should've gotten a D cup.,54140,3
54140,"my advice for ""full"" C cup women: go a size up.",54140,3
54140,My wedding is in 3 days I don't have enough time to exchange :(,54140,3
54141,Shoes did not fit well however there was excellent customer service,54141,3
54142,Not exactly what I expected given the picture.,54142,3
54143,Wide and big for size 2,54143,3
54144,The dress design is my favorite part.,54144,3
54144,"Quality wise, it IS coming from china.",54144,3
54144,"Basically the fabric is very thin, cheap, jersey, only one layer.",54144,3
54144,You cannot really wear panties with it because they would probably show.,54144,3
54144,"Aside from quality, the dress does fit me well.",54144,3
54144,"I measured myself like the bio says you should, because I have a very tiny waist.",54144,3
54144,I was scared it would in turn fall too low.,54144,3
54144,"The dress fits perfect, I could see it being too big for some people, but I can't see it being too small, it has QUITE some stretch on it.",54144,3
54144,"That being said, it is thin ladies, so if there's some muffin top you're trying to hide this is not for you.",54144,3
54144,You do need some ass for this dress so keep that in mind too.,54144,3
54145,Slit is too high up.,54145,3
54145,It took me a minute to figure out how to put it on and then found the tiny hole in the upper right side of the seam.,54145,3
54145,"But once I got it in and tied it around, I noticed it barely covered my crotch area.",54145,3
54145,Any small movement or wind would leave me exposed.,54145,3
54145,Shame because it would have looked nice besides that.,54145,3
54146,"The headbands were really cute and soft, but I think the product description is a bit misleeding.",54146,3
54146,My order said 10pcs but I only received 6 headbands.,54146,3
54147,Beautiful dress but it is a little tight for the size chart.,54147,3
54148,Far too big for my baby's head.,54148,3
54148,They wouldn't even fit her now at 8 months.,54148,3
54148,And she's not exactly petite.,54148,3
54149,I thought they were pink :(... they are brown...,54149,3
54150,Smaller than expected ordered a large for my wife she usually uses a small to medium and the large just fit her.,54150,3
54151,Cute but does run small,54151,3
54152,The neck hole is way too big.,54152,3
54153,Delivery just takes forever.,54153,3
54154,Good dress for the price!,54154,3
54155,Also kind of short.,54155,3
54156,I love the pouch design and fabric.,54156,3
54156,"Just a little smaller fit, so I'm ordering more just a size larger but the pouch design is the best I've seen yet!",54156,3
54158,"It was a good buy, but didn't last even a week.",54158,3
54158,The lace from one shoe came out,54158,3
54159,Seems like it's very small for a 6-12 month cut item .,54159,3
54159,Don't feel like returning it bc they don't have next size so I'm hoping it will get us thru the summer ...seems like good quality and it is adorable,54159,3
54160,This shirt is shear and  chiffon.,54160,3
54161,"Ordinary cotton nightgown, that shrunk up really bad.",54161,3
54161,I always buy nightgowns or lounging tops a little bigger for comfort.,54161,3
54161,"Even though I bought a larger size, washed it in cold water and low fluff dry,..it SHRUNK.",54161,3
54161,"It was below my knee when I tried it on until I washed
it, then the hem shrunk to above my knees.",54161,3
54161,"This little cotton gown is made very narrow, so wouldn't be too comfortable for sleeping.",54161,3
54161,I will use for house work or little daytime household chores in the hot weather.,54161,3
54161,"Very Thin and not as soft as it should be, but just a cover-up.",54161,3
54161,"Pretty color print, but I wouldn't recommend buying.",54161,3
54162,It is not what I was expecting for $38.00.,54162,3
54162,"It is very thin and cheaply made, so I now have a very expensive night shirt.",54162,3
54163,I got a medium.,54163,3
54163,My height is 5 3' and I weigh 1 56.,54163,3
54163,"Its tight around the bum and hips, but once on it fits fine, just a bit uncomfy.",54163,3
54163,"I am African, we tend to have bottoms, maybe that is the problem.",54163,3
54163,"Thats not my only problem however, It also is more of a bright orange as opposed to the sand tones that make it look like African fabric.",54163,3
54163,In person the yellow strings make it look cheap and perhaps maroon / black would make it look classier.,54163,3
54163,"The back is as big(or small) as the front, so it gives that thong look.",54163,3
54163,"(Not for very conservative people)  Overall its a monokini that compliments my body, what can I say, It is cute!",54163,3
54163,Also I would like that cape that I assumed was attached to the back.,54163,3
54163,No cape no fun.,54163,3
54163,I guess the cape mislead me to believe it was actual fabric.,54163,3
54163,In all honesty to the seller she never said it was.,54163,3
54163,It just does not look as good as the photo.,54163,3
54164,Not  that  please,54164,3
54165,The veil is much smaller than what it appears to be on line.,54165,3
54165,It doesn't cover your face at all.,54165,3
54165,"It is a cute product for a photo prop, but again it isn't as large as it appears on line.",54165,3
54166,Perfect no show but the Sizes are little too small,54166,3
54167,Fits larger than expected.,54167,3
54168,Very loose fit and I wear a 16.5 neck.,54168,3
54169,The only thing I don't care for is the cups are made for smaller breasted women.,54169,3
54171,Fits awkward.arms are tight.,54171,3
54171,It's a lightweight jacket but the arms fit weird...,54171,3
54172,"It's super cute and comfy, but it's way too small.",54172,3
54173,Great socks but different length and sizes.,54173,3
54174,"came a little too small, gave it to my girl, and she really love it.",54174,3
54175,I have ordered 4 pairs of the Capris and 2 of them (Floral Illusions and Mint Fresh) are buttery soft and fit well up to a large.,54175,3
54175,"However, the other 2 pairs (Black and Black White Petal Power) are both smaller and not as soft.",54175,3
54175,I believe that there are several brands being sold under this one listing.,54175,3
54175,Only 1 of the 4 pairs has had the yoga waist (Black White Petal Power) but it was significantly smaller in size.,54175,3
54175,It is a toss up what brand/material/size that you will receive when purchasing one of these leggings.,54175,3
54175,Good luck- some of them are awesome!,54175,3
54176,It's a fun kick-around shirt.,54176,3
54176,"I'm petite and this shirt hangs on me a little strange, (sags under the arms and does something strange around the bust area) but for the price I wasn't expecting goth couture.",54176,3
54176,The material feels very slinky almost like exercise/work out clothes.,54176,3
54176,Fun to lounge around in.,54176,3
54177,"I bought this UGG for my Daughter in March 22, 2016.",54177,3
54177,"The shoes are adorable, my daughter says that they are really comfortable, she wears this shoes every other day.",54177,3
54177,My only reason why I giving 3 stars is because up to now July 2016 one of the shoes is completely rip out from one of the sides.,54177,3
54177,She is really disappointed  and she ask me to buy another pair but if this is going to happend again is not worth it.,54177,3
54177,I was expecting a little bit more of durability from this brand.,54177,3
54178,Much smaller than I expected.,54178,3
54179,"I was hoping for something that gripped the floor a bit better, for Barre and Yoga classes, but these did not do the trick.",54179,3
54179,Also very tight around the 4 side toes.,54179,3
54179,Fit well everywhere else though.,54179,3
54180,"Quality is good and also design, but shorts seems to be a little bit small.",54180,3
54181,I use this at home and it is very comfy and cute.,54181,3
54181,The only complaint that I have is that the inside where it is sewn is itchy and scratchy.,54181,3
54181,"If it were more comfortable material, I would have bought it in every color.",54181,3
54181,I still wear it though just because it's so cute.,54181,3
54181,I wear an XL and this fit great,54181,3
54182,Cute to tie up around your swimsuit or shorts.,54182,3
54183,Size was too small for me,54183,3
54184,Fit as expected EXCEPT the bottom legs of the capri are loose.,54184,3
54184,They do not hug the legs and does not fit properly.,54184,3
54185,Good material but way too small.,54185,3
54186,"Material was silky and light....style was great...just a bit smaller than I would prefer, but still a keeper!",54186,3
54187,"Cheaply made, but considering the price.....",54187,3
54187,This chain will definitely turn the skin green.,54187,3
54188,"I normally wear a small, but I ordered this in a medium based on other reviews of it running small.",54188,3
54188,Maybe it's made for kids?,54188,3
54188,I don't know but a medium was too small.,54188,3
54188,Which it stretches so I wouldn't have cared except it's also too short,54188,3
54189,"Quite snug, and sleeves are quarter sleeves.",54189,3
54189,Order 3 sizes up from what you would normally wear.,54189,3
54190,"Got for my husband who is a free mason , it is very pretty sorta heavy but runs huge he wears a 10 on his wedding finger so I went ahead an got a 10 for his left hand thinkin it would be snug but no its like 3 sizes to big",54190,3
54191,This does not look or feel like swim suit cover up.,54191,3
54191,The dress has 2 layers of fabric.,54191,3
54191,This felt more like a momo dress for elders.,54191,3
54191,A good price though.,54191,3
54191,They use it as a summer dress.,54191,3
54192,"this fit very tight, i am a true size 10 so if you are buying it i would buy a size up, love the colors and look though!",54192,3
54193,The Silver Tone Baby Feet Dangle is made specifically for a pregnant woman's belly ring hole.,54193,3
54193,It's objective is to be comfortable while the abdomen is enlarging.,54193,3
54193,"At first, when I received it, I was thrilled to give it to my 23 year-old-daughter who is about 17 weeks pregnant.",54193,3
54193,"While I tried to get her to just take it out and let it close, she did not agree to that idea so this was the next best thing.",54193,3
54193,She was so happy to see the cute little feet.,54193,3
54193,At first when she put it on it felt okay.,54193,3
54193,After about a week of wearing it and she was on the phone to me saying that it always felt as if it was pulling her skin.,54193,3
54193,She felt like her skin was being ripped out were her exact words.,54193,3
54193,We have ordered a few others to see if they are all the same.,54193,3
54194,"love the shirt & ordered 2 sizes too big because it said ran small but this is way too small.. going to have to return
maybe you should resize to the right sizes if you want people to keep & not return",54194,3
54195,"Can't say anything bad bout the company as the title does say, ""Slim Fit"".",54195,3
54195,I ordered two sizes larger than usual and the shirt was still WAY small!,54195,3
54195,"Good shirt, good delivery, good transaction.",54195,3
54195,Just beware that this shirt runs very small.,54195,3
54196,"The diamonds are very small as I somewhat expected, but I am using them for a second hole in my ear so the size is  acceptable for the price.",54196,3
54197,"Very good product, I recommend this, but is betiful.",54197,3
54199,The top did not fit well (very flimsy) in the chest area.,54199,3
54199,"I took out the ""foam"" cups and it fits better.",54199,3
54199,I'll keep it because I really like the color and I'll alter the top so I can wear it.,54199,3
54199,"I also don't like the way it ties in the back; it could become ""untied"" easily.",54199,3
54199,The boyshorts bottom are too small for me and will just be put away.,54199,3
54199,"It could be made better, but then I guess the price would go up.",54199,3
54199,You get what you pay for.....,54199,3
54200,"This bag was a med bag like describes , goes over shoulder with ease , color is Majorca blue , wish it had another spacer or zip pouch , it only has 1 small one for lipstick
Or keys !",54200,3
54200,When I got it I had to stuff towels in it to regain shape,54200,3
54201,My husband loves it and it fits perfectly,54201,3
54204,I expected the gold strip to be a bit longer and thicker.,54204,3
54204,This is quite dainty.,54204,3
54204,I wouldn't have bought this if I had known that.,54204,3
54205,"not real comfortable, but that's not what these are made for....",54205,3
54206,"I will be returning this, unfortunately.",54206,3
54206,I love the off the shoulder look.,54206,3
54206,But the way it hung on my body looked too box.,54206,3
54206,"Honestly, my sizing is all over the place.",54206,3
54206,"I've got a smaller top, but thicker bottom.",54206,3
54206,So sometimes I'm a small and sometimes I'm a large.,54206,3
54206,It really just depends.,54206,3
54206,"I ordered a medium on this and I think I could have gotten away with a small, but I'm not sure if a small would have fit my broad shoulders.",54206,3
54206,So it'll be returned.,54206,3
54206,It just made me look like I had no figure.,54206,3
54206,It's great if you're really really thin and don't have much curve in general though,54206,3
54207,"Nice comfortable dress, however sleeves were longer than expected.",54207,3
54207,Need to wear undershirt to hide bra or don't wear a bra.,54207,3
54208,"bought as present, hopefully recipient will like it.",54208,3
54209,It was smaller than expected .. once I have struggled to fasten it  .. it is a good tight  fit,54209,3
54210,"I expected the heart to be much larger, but it is just 'okay'.",54210,3
54210,"I'm not very fond of how the end point of the heart constantly snags onto all my clothing, but I do wear it everyday still, despite the fact that the point continuous to snag.",54210,3
54210,"I would not order it again however, but makes a cute gift to add as an addition to something else.",54210,3
54212,It's a cheap print of the characters,54212,3
54213,The strap was messed up when I received it and I thought it was broke.,54213,3
54214,"Short waisted, not much rear coverage.",54214,3
54215,"If I had smaller ears, this may have worked.",54215,3
54215,But putting them in was a bother and making sure they stayed in was even worse.,54215,3
54215,"Although, they did show up when they said they would and were of decent quality.",54215,3
54215,It's just an issue of size.,54215,3
54216,quality is good but sizing is off a little.,54216,3
54217,Did not look as great on as the model.,54217,3
54219,"The one that arrived was tan,  not brown as pictured,  it's very soft,  but its the wrong color.",54219,3
54219,"It's more of a girly color,  and I have a boy.",54219,3
54220,Used only for a weekend in big bear,54220,3
54221,Bottoms didn't go up as high as the pic shows.,54221,3
54221,And tassels are not as long at all.,54221,3
54221,Wire came out top after third time wearing.,54221,3
54222,It was pink when I got it (PINK!),54222,3
54222,And the material was very crappy!,54222,3
54223,Dress is beautiful but I need a lager size,54223,3
54224,"They are good quality,  but they run big.",54224,3
54224,So I still have to find a pair for my child.,54224,3
54225,Not for chubby block feet like my sons but very cute for thinner small feet,54225,3
54226,The pattern is much blurrier than it appears in the picture.,54226,3
54226,The pattern is discernible but only if you are standing some what further away from the person wearing the dress.,54226,3
54226,It is ok but definitely looks better in the picture.,54226,3
54227,I ordered several skirts from this seller and I love them all.,54227,3
54227,"all others where dark colors, this is the first light color I bought, but it is pretty see through and a very thin material.",54227,3
54228,The purse in the picture looks lighter than the purse is!,54228,3
54229,The color said navy blue.,54229,3
54229,When I received it the top cover and the strings were purple and the stripes were navy blue would have been perfect if it was all navy blue as stated.,54229,3
54230,Material is good but too much string for a petit guy.,54230,3
54230,"I have 33.5"" hip measure and had to take about 5 off the waist and 3"" off the back strap to keep the strings in my pants.",54230,3
54231,came in on time but some of the jewels weren't on the bows so i had to glue them on myself,54231,3
54232,I think they are plastic.,54232,3
54233,They look and feel good (while standing).,54233,3
54233,-2 stars because they do that thing where when you sit down the crotch area folds and makes it look like you have a boner.,54233,3
54233,I already tore the tags off before I realized this or I would return them.,54233,3
54233,"Otherwise, they're decent shorts.",54233,3
54234,"The quality was not as good as I had hoped for, but then, they don't charge much either.",54234,3
54235,They were to big,54235,3
54236,"little too large, and little pricey.",54236,3
54236,Not even good quality fabric.,54236,3
54237,it's pretty and people thought it was real.,54237,3
54237,but one small jewel fell out after a couple weeks.,54237,3
54238,good looking but not useful,54238,3
54239,Colors are much more muted than expected,54239,3
54240,Doesn't come in a box as shown has to order 2 times to get a non broken pair.,54240,3
54241,"They're cute and fit is good, but I returned due to a very strong chemical smell and a felt like sole.",54241,3
54241,"I've seen more and more shoes veing made with this type of sole, and I find it baffling.",54241,3
54244,"They are cute, but considering they are made from clay.",54244,3
54244,The person who makes these should smooth out the clay.,54244,3
54244,"It has finger prints on them, scrump has a nail mark, and a dirty piece of clay on his backside.",54244,3
54244,I was hoping since these were Disney branded they would have been made with higher standards of quality.,54244,3
54244,From afar they are really cute.,54244,3
54244,Up close they show too many finger prints.,54244,3
54244,It doesn't take much to smooth out clay.,54244,3
54244,Just my thoughts tho.,54244,3
54244,"For the price, and the fact it included two necklaces, it was a good deal.",54244,3
54245,For this to be a plus size garment the bust on this thing is like really small and has underwire.,54245,3
54245,I got the 4XL; you would think the bra would have been larger.,54245,3
54245,Pretty bathing suit but these look like C cups.,54245,3
54246,Much smaller than i thought.,54246,3
54247,"i love this swimsuit, it fit perfectly im giving 3 stars because the starp in the back was missing.. :/",54247,3
54248,"I hope you have more larger than this size ,",54248,3
54249,Runs at least 1 size too small.,54249,3
54249,I ordered a large for my daughter who is a size10 normally.,54249,3
54249,She couldn't put it on.,54249,3
54250,Nice glasses but not good for someone with a smaller face.,54250,3
54250,Sadly had to return these because they fell down my nose!,54250,3
54251,Pretty darn cute these pajamas.,54251,3
54251,The fabric is a little flimsy and stretches out of shape but the embroidered strawberry adds some strength so they don't get too stretched out.,54251,3
54252,The sizes run very small.,54252,3
54253,The picture is very pretty and really stands out against the black background.,54253,3
54253,Don't like the compact-ness.,54253,3
54253,It doesn't easily fold up and can't get it to fold back into sleeve.,54253,3
54254,Much thinner than they appeared online.,54254,3
54254,The description was a little misleading.,54254,3
54255,I ordered a xl women's.,54255,3
54255,I got sent a 3xl men's and it fit so I kept it but I'm assuming that a xl women's would be too small.,54255,3
54256,It's a very pretty dress great color but I can't even fit my boobs in it!,54256,3
54256,"I bought a lg and I'm a C cup, Definitely upsets me ive never had a problem like this and it fits fine everywhere else",54256,3
54257,ITS JUST AN OK TEE SHIRT.,54257,3
54257,I WAS EXPECTING A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY FROM DRAKE.,54257,3
54258,A little small but right product,54258,3
54259,Does NOT look like the picture.....nope not even close.,54259,3
54259,I did realize it was white.,54259,3
54259,Keeping to use as a bathing suit cover up even though I was planning to use it over a straight slip style mini dress.,54259,3
54260,"I bought them for myself so I was disappointed to see how very
small they are.",54260,3
54260,I gave them to my granddaughter.,54260,3
54261,Not the material it was expected to be.,54261,3
54262,I was expecting a little bit better size I guess for the cost.,54262,3
54262,But it's a nice smaller sized wallet.,54262,3
54262,Very thin with only a few credit card slots but itlll do for what I need it for.,54262,3
54263,For the price the quality could be better.,54263,3
54263,Purchased a half size up and they are still tight.,54263,3
54265,Nice fabric but somewhat small,54265,3
54266,Bought this for my cousin.,54266,3
54266,Not very high-quality and the gauge is way too long.,54266,3
54266,"But, she seems to like it, so whatevs.",54266,3
54267,Not impressed with size or quality.,54267,3
54268,the grey pair fits fine but the black pair i have to squeeze into..  Not the same fit for sure but over all they are fine..,54268,3
54269,"Quite uncomfortable around the neck area (where it ties) for prolonged wear (I wore mine for almost 10 hours), but other than that, it fit as expected.",54269,3
54270,The bottoms run a little small on me...I think if I would have sized up more the bottoms would have fit but the top would have been too big.,54270,3
54270,I found another pair of bottoms at walmart to wear with the top,54270,3
54271,It turned by finger a little green after about 3 weeks of wearing it.,54271,3
54271,Also came smaller than expected so I would reccomend ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than your normal ring size.,54271,3
54271,"Other than that, the ring is beautiful and material does not feel or look cheap.",54271,3
54272,"Not the best quality, but decent for the price.",54272,3
54272,"I'm 5'4"", the length is good.",54272,3
54272,Color is as pictured.,54272,3
54273,The back ripped first time wearing it.,54273,3
54275,looks good but is cheaply made.,54275,3
54276,Nice set but the necklace was of a cheaper quality than expected.,54276,3
54277,"item was ok, just not for me",54277,3
54278,The picture is very fuzzy.,54278,3
54278,You can't really tell that its a mermaid.,54278,3
54279,"This shirt seems to run a size small even before washing, but it is soft.",54279,3
54280,"Very strange, slick, static-y and thin fabric that feels like a windbreaker almost.",54280,3
54280,It's like a digital print.,54280,3
54280,It fits fine and seems to have a sturdy zipper.,54280,3
54280,"The belt that came with it is some kind of faux leather that had a strong chemical smell to it, so I tossed it.",54280,3
54280,From a little further away it looks cute.,54280,3
54280,"All in all, I'll be wearing it but I wouldn't buy another print.",54280,3
54281,"It is okay, not wonderfull",54281,3
54282,"okay but, one of the shoes didn't work and so i had to return them",54282,3
54283,"Unfortunately, I had to return this item.",54283,3
54283,"It was much too small in the bust, and not like ""amazing cleavage"" small, but more like ""this is definitely going to get me arrested"" small.",54283,3
54283,The rest of the suit was too large.,54283,3
54283,"This suit, though cute and well-constructed, seems to have been designed with a pear shape in mind.",54283,3
54283,"(For reference, my measurements are 45-38-45, bra size 40DD)  Thankfully, the return was processed very quickly and I had my money back the day after I sent it off using their free return label.",54283,3
54283,"""A+"" for customer service at least!",54283,3
54284,"Really cool looking watch, but broke after a week of wearing it.",54284,3
54285,When I first put this suit on a thought I loved it.,54285,3
54285,"The sizing was a good fit for me, at 148 lbs, 5'5'', 34D.",54285,3
54285,"The bra style top was a nice look on my body shape, and the pattern is pretty cute and interesting.",54285,3
54285,"However, when I turned to the side, the shape of the cups make it look like the pointy parts of my breasts are pointing up.",54285,3
54285,"I guess it could pass as being a retro looking shape for a bikini top, but it felt a little weird on me.",54285,3
54285,The bottoms fit nice but I'm still not sure the high waist looks good on my body type.,54285,3
54285,I debated keeping this one just to see if I could grow to like it.,54285,3
54285,It does have removable straps which is nice for tanning.,54285,3
54285,I wish the bottoms showed a little more cheek.,54285,3
54285,All in all I decided to keep looking to see if I can find something I love first before I settle.,54285,3
54286,Very pretty but length is on the small side.,54286,3
54286,Just barely fits a 7 1/2 wrist,54286,3
54287,"Way too long, but very comfy.",54287,3
54288,"It was cute and it worked, it just wasn't quite what I was expecting.",54288,3
54288,"The shirt I thought was white, but when it arrived, it seemed to have a more like yellow tinge to it, and the skirt had this plastic lining going thru it, which was meant to give the tulle shape and fluff but at the seams the plastic line poked thru and kept kinda poking my daughter in the side so I swapped the skirt with a valentine's day tulle skirt she had in pink and It all worked out.",54288,3
54289,Fit smaller than most shirts of the same size and no larger size was available.,54289,3
54289,Small through bust and shoulders.,54289,3
54289,Could simply be the wrong cut for my top heavy figure.,54289,3
54289,I didn't recall what I thought of the quality of material because it didn't fit.,54289,3
54291,Blouse runs small I ordered and XL based on the sizing chart but it was way too small for me.,54291,3
54291,"But my daughter-in-law was able to wear it, so all is not lost.",54291,3
54292,Its a knock off of the real version.,54292,3
54292,And the white fur sheds everywhere!,54292,3
54292,"When I first tried it on, it got in my hair, all over my floor!",54292,3
54292,And it way too small!,54292,3
54292,I doesnt even cover my butt :( disappointed and definitely returning this!,54292,3
54294,Production description did not match the item received.,54294,3
54294,Website indicated chiffon however received a polyester dress.,54294,3
54294,It is definitely not as flowy as in pictures.,54294,3
54294,Although I did somewhat liked the polyester dress so I didn't want to go through the hassel of returning the item.,54294,3
54295,It was a little too small.,54295,3
54295,Was returned due to a stain on the front of the shirt when opened from box.,54295,3
54296,It is very very thin though.,54296,3
54296,You can see right through it.,54296,3
54297,"I ordered XL but this is not American sizing & it is about a size 8, Very cute jacket & good delivery but I was very disappointed at the sizing.",54297,3
54298,It's ok I guess.,54298,3
54298,"It arrive ripped, but hey it looks ripped away so....",54298,3
54299,Just runs a little small.,54299,3
54299,"I'm a seamstress, for this price I'll make it fit.",54299,3
54299,But for those who just want it to fit...,54299,3
54299,I'd say order 2 sizes too large.,54299,3
54300,The grey sleeper has a hole in the seam of the left leg.,54300,3
54300,The other side of the leg has extra material.,54300,3
54300,I hemmed up the other leg because it was to long for my son.,54300,3
54300,I should have just returned to get the right size.,54300,3
54301,I bought this for a company Christmas party but the band was quite small for my head.,54301,3
54301,The battery came dead.,54301,3
54301,I plan on cutting it open and replacing the batteries.,54301,3
54301,They should really come with a pull tab to keep from energy waste.,54301,3
54301,"The top antlers were floppy, but other than that I see some potential for a cheap festive piece.",54301,3
54302,"My 20 month old think he's the boss, this outfit describes him well.",54302,3
54302,I notice after washing it couple times the bottoms  looked worn out but the shirt still looks new.,54302,3
54302,Giving it a 3 on the quality for the pants.,54302,3
54302,It also fit a little big on him.,54302,3
54303,"They are ok. Just expected a more flat surface, not bubble like.",54303,3
54304,Cool hats....love the fabric...awesome fit,54304,3
54305,"ok, product for this price",54305,3
54306,This affordable two piece dress looks really expensive.,54306,3
54306,The top makes the outfit so pretty.,54306,3
54306,"But a couple of things that makes it not perfect, its latches pretty tight around the neck.",54306,3
54306,"The bust pads are a little large, the skirt is too long for a 5' 3 person.",54306,3
54306,But that's ok with a few alterations it will look great!,54306,3
54307,"Although I usually wear a small, I ordered the medium size, which fit well.",54307,3
54307,"I do like the dress and it is comfortable; however, the fabric is a bit thin and the laces slightly loose.",54307,3
54308,"These are ok, but prefer the LOXTM Mega grid backs.",54308,3
54308,"These do seem to be better than the regular backs that come with most earrings, but not the security that I was looking for.",54308,3
54309,Not great quality but equal to the price.,54309,3
54309,"The heart is barely heart shaped and crooked, but still cute and I will wear it.",54309,3
54310,One sleeve is tighter on the arm than the other and the stitching pulling apart.,54310,3
54311,Make sure to order 2 sizes up compared to your US size.,54311,3
54312,Veil comes without comb.,54312,3
54312,"It looks like an oval tablecloth, with the same lace pattern around the edges.",54312,3
54312,The lace is pretty.,54312,3
54312,Although the workmanship wasn't great (see photos).,54312,3
54312,"The sequins are quite bling-y, and I decided it was too gaudy for my wedding.",54312,3
54313,"Pretty, but doesn't feel sturdy.",54313,3
54314,We love the vivid bright coloring the fit is tight we ordered a large my daughter wears medium and large and it is fitted on her I would recommend going one size bigger than you would expect to have a comfortable fit and not worry about shrinking,54314,3
54315,Its cheaply made but what do you expect for 4 bucks!,54315,3
54315,My 13 yr old liked it and thats all that mattered.,54315,3
54316,Nice gloves but a little itchy so I'm not sure how comfortable they'd be if worn for a longer period of time.,54316,3
54317,"The material is very thin, and the sleeves were very tight, though for the most part the fit was okay.",54317,3
54317,"The only thing I really dislike, beyond how thin it is, is that the neck doesn't seem to sit quite right.",54317,3
54317,"There is no gap in the middle when it is buttoned, it just makes a straight line, and the black seams arching up to meet the top middle seam seem very wavy as if the fabric got bunched into it a bit while sewing it.",54317,3
54317,"You get what you pay for, that always needs to be kept in mind.",54317,3
54318,someone order this through me,54318,3
54320,I recommend to order 2 size larger than your usual size bc i needed to do that but it for just right but not right,54320,3
54321,When I received the scarf some of the dark colors were faded into the lighter colors.,54321,3
54321,Cute but not 5 stars...,54321,3
54323,"Pretty dress, but very poor fit and workmanship - did not make to my sent in measurements.",54323,3
54323,"Since it was made in China, their measuring system may be interpreted differently.",54323,3
54324,"sleeves fit very tight and dress was smaller than I expected even tho I ordered an XXL, but it's not bad for the price.",54324,3
54324,I wear a 12/14 btw...,54324,3
54325,"The color is wonderful, the material is soft...",54325,3
54325,It sits well on a small waist...but the material was really thin around the butt.,54325,3
54325,Could see every part of my underwear.,54325,3
54325,The rest of the dress was so nice I really hate to return this.,54325,3
54325,I'm 5'8 150 general size 8-10 I bought a medium and it fit perfectly.,54325,3
54325,Hung just above mid calf.,54325,3
54326,Chain was crappy quality.,54326,3
54326,Hatchetman looked weird and feet were crazy pointy and hurt my chest.,54326,3
54326,After about a month the loop the hold it to the chain opened and had to squeeze it shut constantly.,54326,3
54326,Still looks like a Hatchetman tho so I think it wasn't bad for the price.,54326,3
54327,The bottom of the tail doesn't connect,54327,3
54328,I expected a bit more.,54328,3
54328,The designs are cute and will give you a laugh.,54328,3
54328,the material is somewhat stretchy which is an good thing because the band seems small I wear a size 8 shoe and the heel of the sock was just after mine.,54328,3
54328,"don't know how they wash, but  I don
't think there will be a problem, the material feels ok. For the price Its worth it.",54328,3
54328,May get a set for myself!!,54328,3
54329,Not a fan but kept anyway.,54329,3
54329,Did not know how to return.,54329,3
54329,before I knew it time had passed.,54329,3
54330,The only reason that I'm giving this 3 stars is because the fit was a little loose.,54330,3
54330,I'm 145 lbs with a large chest at 36DD and I was surprised that the small fit so loose.,54330,3
54330,I wish that they had and x-small because I love the colors and the cut.,54330,3
54331,I was excited about this top.,54331,3
54331,"It arrived as expected, and looked like the picture.",54331,3
54331,It was a little big for me and I wear a size small.,54331,3
54331,The negative part is that it shrunk a ridiculous amount.,54331,3
54331,And I didn't put it in the dryer.,54331,3
54331,Signs of cheap material.,54331,3
54333,Fits small in the mid section.,54333,3
54333,"Could drive a lesser person towards their ""insecurities""...",54333,3
54333,Thank goodness I'm a masochist!,54333,3
54334,"Cool looking beanie, just a VERY tight fit...my head isn't that big either.",54334,3
54334,Hopefully it will stretch out a little.,54334,3
54334,Cutting of circulation lol,54334,3
54335,"There were threads out of place, but what can you expect for something so cheap.",54335,3
54335,"It serves its purpose, I needed something until I found what I really wanted.",54335,3
54335,I'm not one to keep tons of bags on hand.,54335,3
54336,Wish it was a little larger fingers swell in summer lovely jewelry,54336,3
54337,Cute but cheap looking....,54337,3
54337,But you get what you pay for,54337,3
54338,These are cute but way small,54338,3
54339,For the price- you get what you pay for.,54339,3
54339,It's a great shirt for under a cardigan but not so much for going out in.,54339,3
54339,I like that it's soft and I do wear it under other things.,54339,3
54341,"Its to small I order large and it look like small size, the material it's a goo quality.",54341,3
54342,"I normally wear a xl us size, the first Allegra K shirt i bought was a bit big but comfy, so i decided to buy this one a size down.",54342,3
54342,Still fit big and i almost want to say you have to have some hips/curves for this shirt.,54342,3
54342,The material is thin and not warm.,54342,3
54342,"Also my shirt says ""Angela Baby"" of course with other wtitings also but Angela baby stands out most, thats a disappointment.",54342,3
54343,"I order this beautiful Fred's for my daughter,  it's nice but smaller than we thought...",54343,3
54344,It was shorter than I would like but still a comfy dress,54344,3
54345,Bought this for my wife.,54345,3
54345,The top is too large and the bottoms are a bit too small.,54345,3
54345,"If you are a 6-8 bottom, they will be nice, but you'll need a bigger rack than 32B to fill out the top.",54345,3
54345,:-)  Doesn't look like it's available anymore anyway.,54345,3
54346,My daughter loves this so I am happy with it,54346,3
54347,If i had a smaller chest is would fit.,54347,3
54347,I am a size 9 and i got an xl.,54347,3
54347,....Fits perfectly until i reach my chest.,54347,3
54347,I've been loosing weight though so i will keep it as motivation.,54347,3
54347,I love the design and fabric.,54347,3
54348,The bag really doesn't look like the photo.,54348,3
54348,It's is very floppy and does not keep shape like it shows in the picture.,54348,3
54348,The colors is not quite right either.,54348,3
54348,The leather is soft which is nice and I like multiple pockets but because its so floppy it's hard to reach into any of them.,54348,3
54349,They are too long and too thick.,54349,3
54349,But the color is very nice.,54349,3
54349,Not sure I'll wear them much.,54349,3
54350,"I liked the top for the most part; however, it is definitely not true to size.",54350,3
54350,"I'm almost always a small or medium, so I got a medium to be safe, and while it fit, it fit too snugly for my liking, which definitely made it look less dressy/work-appropriate and more like something I'd where out at night.",54350,3
54350,"Definitely, definitely order a size up, unless you like tight-fitting things (which I don't).",54350,3
54351,This shirt is a piece of female clothing.,54351,3
54351,As a guy it was shocking because it was smaller than expected and well the neck hole was really big.,54351,3
54352,"I had to get a sun hat for my 10 month old son, and we are leaving next week for Florida.",54352,3
54352,I had ordered this because it was Amazon prime and would ship in two days.,54352,3
54352,The picture shows this hat as a light tangerine orange.,54352,3
54352,"When I opened the box it was a bright, borderline neon orange.",54352,3
54352,It's too late for me to return it and do an exchange.,54352,3
54352,I realize it's all preference but bright orange doesn't look good on my kiddo while light orange does.,54352,3
54352,Over all the fit was good and it looked cute.,54352,3
54353,"I'm 5ft 2in and weigh 185 lbs, I ordered 2x.",54353,3
54353,The bottoms fit great but the top is way too small.,54353,3
54353,My bra size is 38ddd and this fit like a 40d.,54353,3
54353,Super cute just wish the top was larger.,54353,3
54354,Belt is cute but smaller than I thought.,54354,3
54354,I have a size 12 waist and this is a little tighter than I would have wanted.,54354,3
54354,"Other than that, it would have been perfect.",54354,3
54354,There was no funny smell like someone else had described.,54354,3
54355,"Cute bracelet, but description said came with a gift box, no gift box was sent with my order",54355,3
54356,I bought it as a weekend morning around the house dress.,54356,3
54356,Main complaint is the presence of a seam around the neck in front that is very noticeable.,54356,3
54357,Sizing was smaller than expected,54357,3
54358,"No elastic in leg opening, doesn't fit my legs well.",54358,3
54359,"Too small for me, but gave it as a gift.",54359,3
54360,It works as expected.,54360,3
54360,"However, after a couple of weeks I wore it, one of the structure bone steel came out.",54360,3
54361,This dress is adorable!,54361,3
54361,"It is made well, with nice materials, just runs small to the size.",54361,3
54361,"I loved the look and feel of the dress, but it just is not true to size.",54361,3
54361,"Instead of giving it to my granddaughter, I found someone else with a little girl that is smaller and could use the dress.",54361,3
54361,"They loved it, and so all is well that ends well!",54361,3
54362,Not the fit that I expected.,54362,3
54363,Fell apart after washing but are cute and soft,54363,3
54364,"As like other reviews,  what gives with the shaft space?_ you literally have to fight to get it in and then at full mast it's too short.",54364,3
54364,Who is determining that this is what we look like?,54364,3
54364,3 stars just for soft feel material.,54364,3
54365,bought the XXXL for husband.,54365,3
54365,The top half of the vest fits great but the bottom is still to small.,54365,3
54365,looks good over all and is what i wanted.,54365,3
54366,"It's cute, but way smaller than the picture makes it seem.",54366,3
54367,"Ring is nice, and heavy, however mine is missing the gold color on the band in a few spots.",54367,3
54368,I like them but they could be longer.,54368,3
54370,The bottoms are to small,54370,3
54371,For gigantic chested women only...,54371,3
54372,The plastic read XXL but the dress has a M size lable on it...,54372,3
54372,It looks like it would withstand a few wears.,54372,3
54372,"Since I only want it to wear it 1time, i think it will hild fine.",54372,3
54372,"I am reordering, i hope i get the right size next time.",54372,3
54372,"It seems very short, i hope it's longer on the xxl size..",54372,3
54373,"Pretty dress, but runs small.",54373,3
54373,"I'm a 12, so as was suggested, purchased a Large, but dress is tight and somewhat ""see through"".",54373,3
54373,An XL would have worked better.,54373,3
54375,Cute saying but cheap material and the medium was more like a small.,54375,3
54376,"Very thin fabric so its almost like that ""slinky"" fabric that sits on any bump or lump :(",54376,3
54377,"cute headband, the bow is pretty big and stands out more then i wanted.",54377,3
54377,i cut the bow tags off and still love the thick headband for the winter.,54377,3
54378,Was a little shorter than expected,54378,3
54380,5/10/2016 UPDATE: So I sent the shirt back and ordered a small.,54380,3
54380,"It's still a little large, but doable.",54380,3
54380,Now the problem is that the armholes are still too low to the point that you can see my bra so it's just been hanging sad and alone in the my closet on a hanger.,54380,3
54380,"I'm trying to find an undershirt that is a similar color that I can wear with it, but it's hard matching the shade.",54380,3
54380,":-(

ORIGINAL Posting: It's a pretty shirt, but the arm holes hang down too low.",54380,3
54380,I ordered up since people kept saying it ran very small.,54380,3
54380,Turns out the XXL was way too big.,54380,3
54380,I can't decide if I want to try ordering a smaller size or return it and get my money back.,54380,3
54381,My husband has been looking for this style of briefs for awhile and he was very excited to find them @ Amazon.,54381,3
54381,"They are the same brief, same fit and sizing, but the fabric is much thinner and cheaper than ones purchased a few years ago.",54381,3
54381,"Too bad, because according to the reviews many people like these briefs.",54381,3
54382,Nice but snug fit.. overall happy,54382,3
54383,It's pretty but way to small.,54383,3
54383,I am returning it,54383,3
54384,Butterfly was smaller than expected.,54384,3
54384,"It was a gift, the recipient was very pleased with it.",54384,3
54385,"Its actually only a 3/4 length sleeved shirt, and it is about 2 sizes too small, and not as long as pictured",54385,3
54386,I'm dissapointed because it isn't made from natural leather.,54386,3
54386,The sleeves are a little to long and wide.,54386,3
54387,looks amazing one my child when new.,54387,3
54387,but I wanted a earing that wouldn't tarnish due to bathing.,54387,3
54387,Although its great at protecting my child's ear from infections because its gold plated and sterling silver which was my top priority I wanted the earrings to last.,54387,3
54387,"As a mother its hard taking on and off earrings daily for bath time, having a earring that would not tarnish and last for at least 3 months would of be worth it.",54387,3
54387,Overall the product is okay I do love the screw back on for safety.,54387,3
54387,If you have the time to take the earrings off for bathing it will last longer and be worth your money.,54387,3
54388,Swimsuit is super cute.,54388,3
54388,"However, the bottoms are about 3 sizes too small compared to the top.",54388,3
54388,"With the price, I may just order another size much bigger and make it work.",54388,3
54389,"Very comfortable, stretchy and a good length, not too short.",54389,3
54389,But definitely rides up when in exercising.,54389,3
54390,Do not put this in the dryer.,54390,3
54391,I bought this dress in an extra small after looking at the sizing chart.,54391,3
54391,Initially I was sent a white mens shirt instead of the dress and when I finally received the dress I was disappointed.,54391,3
54391,The dress is way longer than in the picture.,54391,3
54391,"It comes down to my shins, also I thought it was  a cotton dress, but it has a stretchy polyester feel to it.",54391,3
54391,"I definitely won't wear this, but cannot return it due to the original mix up with the shirt,",54391,3
54392,"I'm 6'5"" and the straps are pretty tight even when fully extended.",54392,3
54392,"Would not recommend for taller folks, but okay otherwise.",54392,3
54393,good size and plenty of room.,54393,3
54393,I found that the slippery material that the insides are made out of made me nervous because my credit cards easily slipped out when I opened the wallet.,54393,3
54393,Be careful of this.,54393,3
54395,"Nice hat, way to big.",54395,3
54397,I ordered it for my LGG4 and got excited to get it.,54397,3

54401,was not flowy as picture suggests,54401,3
54402,legs are really short - highwaters.,54402,3
54402,about 3-4 inches above the ankle.,54402,3
54402,"my son refuses to wear it so returning, but i think it's cute.",54402,3
54403,Love these shorts...ordered two pair.,54403,3
54403,The larger size fit my sister as expected and look really nice on her.,54403,3
54403,"However, mine fit too small and I ordered the same size that I generally wear, but they were at least a size too small.",54403,3
54403,"I sent them back and asked for them to exchange them for the next size, but I never received them.",54403,3
54403,"I did get a refund, so, no sweat....but I would have much rather had the next size.",54403,3

54404,I get tons of compliments on it.,54404,3
54404,My .380 fits very well.,54404,3
54404,Wouldn't hold anything much bigger though.,54404,3
54404,9mm is too bulky to slide in.,54404,3
54404,Small body ccw's with smooth hammers will work.,54404,3
54405,"I don't hate it, but I don't love it.",54405,3
54406,size medium fitted a little bit too big but looked ok.  the material is very cheap.,54406,3
54406,its good to use on top of a swimsuit or the beach.,54406,3
54407,"I got this after my c-section a month ago, and have tried wearing it over the past few weeks of recovery.",54407,3
54407,"The abdominal part is far too loose, and the leg holes are too small, cutting into my skin.",54407,3
54407,The panty part wasn't large enough in the back to cover my tush.,54407,3
54408,This is cute but completely see through.,54408,3
54408,More of a nightie than a short set,54408,3
54409,I like this product but I feel that it is a bit too long.,54409,3
54409,I have a short torso and it doesn't fit right when I sit down.,54409,3
54409,I was told that it doesn't come in other lengths so I am considering returning it but otherwise it fits well.,54409,3
54410,"Cute product, just be careful when wearing them, as they fit a bit loosley and they can easily pop off while wearing them throughout the day.",54410,3
54411,Everyone acted like this was so big.,54411,3
54411,I would say no more than a large.,54411,3
54411,Polyester type material and the colors are beautiful but too small for me.,54411,3
54413,Super cute but it is see through and basically becomes a wedgey suit.,54413,3
54413,I do like it though!,54413,3
54414,It's a little long for my taste and didn't like the fabric,54414,3

I prefer longer ear vines.",54415,3
54415,The stones and length of the ear vine were too small for me.,54415,3
54415,I was concerned the back was too delicate to manipulate to put in my ear as ear vines do need some manipulation to insert and set on the ear.,54415,3
54415,I am tempted to give them a 4 just because they are came in delightfully packaged.,54415,3
54415,"The box includes a silver protection bag, a silver cleaning fabric piece and a matching case.",54415,3
54415,Ever Faith truly makes a beautiful customer experience with their package making an item a beautiful gift.,54415,3
54415,I am returning them.,54415,3
54416,"I don't like the clasp, I have a very slender wrist so it just doesn't work for me.",54416,3
54417,"I can't even put it in , it's really hard to get in the hole to close it",54417,3
54418,Too long for me.,54418,3
54419,They were ok they last me for 1 year I used them almost for a year until they broke,54419,3
54420,"This is the best design out of all the Harry Potter pocket watches I've searched for, so I really wanted it, despite the so-so reviews.",54420,3
54420,I was not surprised that mine stopped working immediately after I received it.,54420,3
54420,"I would set the time and it would work for a bit, but then somehow get stuck.",54420,3
54420,"**I took mine to a watch repair place instead of returning, because I needed it for an upcoming event.",54420,3
54420,They just told me the battery provided was crap and replaced it with a good one - it's been working ever since!,54420,3
54420,Remember that if you want to buy it!,54420,3
54420,Cost me $10 to replace the battery.,54420,3
54420,"Lastly, other reviews are correct that you have to carefully pry it open with a small and thin flat head screwdriver or something sturdy.",54420,3
54421,can't figure out how to wear it.,54421,3
54422,I love it but pictures seem kind of cheap and blurry,54422,3
54423,I really like these for my son; my only thing with them is that the red/green on the pants do not really match the red/green on the shirt.,54423,3
54423,The set does not look like they should go together.,54423,3
54423,"Otherwise, adorable pajamas and very comfortable for my 2 year old.",54423,3
54424,"I am 5'9 160lbs 36C, I wear a large in most american sized sports bras.",54424,3
54424,XL was so small I don't think even the XXL would work.,54424,3
54424,Nice quality but these are definitely for smaller women.,54424,3
54425,This is not an XXL.,54425,3
54425,It fits more like an XL.,54425,3
54426,It's possible that my recent weight gain was such that it moved me from XL to XXL without my realizing it when I placed the order.,54426,3
54426,Or possibly the cut is a bit small.,54426,3
54426,It's probably the former but I can't rule out the latter.,54426,3
54426,"Other than that, the quality is fine.",54426,3
54427,"The shirt is adorable & soft & reliable to the Carter's brand, true to size; HOWEVER, it is LONG SLEEVED (or at least, the one sent to me is long sleeved.)",54427,3
54427,"It was a gift for my niece & I didn't have time to make a return, so I gave her a long sleeved shirt in the 100 degree weather.",54427,3
54427,Hopefully it still fits this Winter.,54427,3
54427,Really cute shirt though.,54427,3
54428,shirt and design are great/as expected but shirt is definitely not XL.,54428,3
54428,Ordered a Moto Guzzi and Victory shirt and neither is sized correctly.,54428,3
54428,"I normally wear an XL w/no issues, but these shirts fit more like a tight L than a XL",54428,3
54429,"The top of bathing suit fits well, but the bottom fits like a US 4-6 and not an 8-10 like the company stated.",54429,3
54429,This could be because I have an hour glass figure with a nice sized butt.,54429,3
54429,Or it could be that the fabric does not give in the waist area.,54429,3
54429,Or a combination of both.,54429,3
54429,The xxl = 8-10 in US.,54429,3
54430,Love the design but it fit a little smaller than I was hoping for.,54430,3
54431,It was to big for me little one.,54431,3
54432,Could have used instructions on how to take them apart.,54432,3
54432,But otherwise nice for the price,54432,3
54433,I ordered the blue and it's a nice quality shirt but runs very small.,54433,3
54434,It's cute but dosent look like the pic,54434,3
54435,Fit as expected but took too long to arrived.,54435,3
54436,I have them adjusted to where I like them.,54436,3
54436,They keep my uniform shirt tucked neatly all day...and... they are comfortable!,54436,3
54436,Comfort is a big plus.,54436,3
54436,"Occasionally though, one of the clamps will disconnect.",54436,3
54436,If the grip was a bit stronger then these would be five stars!,54436,3
54436,I have the foot loop version.,54436,3
54437,"Think it is important to know these are pocket less shorts, had I paid better attention I never would have bought them.",54437,3
54438,The size was xxl and it was still too small.,54438,3
54438,Maybe you should put shoulder measurements,54438,3
54440,I love the way it looks mine looks just like the picture...,54440,3
54440,I thought I ordered the 3x but got a 2x but that's not the case I ordered the wrong size.,54440,3
54440,It's very tight in the arms.,54440,3
54440,I am going to have to fix the sleeves to fit.,54440,3
54440,It's very cute it took a lot of work to get it off,54440,3
54441,This is a well made shirt but there was just too much material for me.,54441,3
54441,"As a dress it was great, so if that's what you're getting it for you may like it.",54441,3
54441,Cinched up as a shirt became too much and not practical physical for water activities.,54441,3
54441,I returned this for a full zip up long sleeve fitted shirt instead.,54441,3
54441,I'm 105 lbs and 5'4 and the xsmall was an ok fit.,54441,3
54442,didnt fit as expected,54442,3
54443,Works as expected but washing instructions state not to dry in dryer.,54443,3
54443,"We hung to dry and they developed a weird, musky smell.",54443,3
54443,"Otherwise, they do the job!",54443,3
54444,"Nice fabric, decent construction, nice level of detail and style.",54444,3
54444,"All the products that warn you about ""Asian sizes"" are telling you they are girls/ junior sizes.",54444,3
54444,The measurements table may not reflect it but they are.,54444,3
54444,2-3 sizes smaller than they should be.,54444,3
54444,Most xtra large won't fit an 8-10.,54444,3
54445,Fits large and didn't wash all that great.,54445,3
54446,"This item is cute, but read the description, it is gold colored not silver like the picture",54446,3
54447,"This is going to be used in fun shorter races so I don't mind too too much but when I opened the package in my kitchen, GLITTER EXPLOSION!!!!!!!!",54447,3
54447,"Just be aware that this thing is covered in glitter and it will get everywhere when you open it and will get on your clothes, in the car (if you wear it on your way to the race or event).",54447,3
54447,I stuffed it into a plastic bag and tossed it on at the race and then brushed myself off and stuffed it back into the bag until the next time I am doing a fun race.,54447,3
54448,I received this bathing suit and I really like it.,54448,3
54448,It fits tight up top and kinda loose on the bottom but is still doable.,54448,3
54448,I can't wait to wear it.,54448,3
54449,I just got these two days ago.,54449,3
54449,The decal is already coming off.,54449,3
54449,"Besides that, they fit nicely and they look good.",54449,3
54450,"Workmanship on the shirt is not the best in the world, but will do.",54450,3
54451,The shirt was very thin,54451,3
54452,They were a little bit tight on my very average to small size 9 month old.,54452,3
54453,The shirt is not very big for a 3XL and after it was washed didn't fit at all.,54453,3
54453,They need to offer bigger sizes if these are this small.,54453,3
54454,Can't really bend over in it so if you live with family or siblings you might want to wear some shirts or something,54454,3
54455,"Great looking watch, however, the band started to turn colors from my sleeve rubbing on it.",54455,3
54456,Runs small and rather sheer,54456,3
54457,did not fit but short is good,54457,3
54458,"It's a nice dress and the material isn't too bad, however the color was off and it was a lot shorter than the picture",54458,3
54459,The stockings that come with it are much too small but overall fits as it should.,54459,3
54460,"Beautiful color... definitely got what I paid for, but they still serve their purpose well.",54460,3
54461,"It does not look as elegant as the picture, it appears to be ribbon stringed through some stones.",54461,3
54462,It would be better if there were elastic cuffs to keep the wind out but otherwise a good coat..,54462,3
54463,"It was too small for me, but it was a great gift for my niece who is 11 years old.",54463,3
54465,"This shirt is more like a night shirt as it is super comfy, but it was so long.",54465,3
54465,I saw comments before I bought it and I tthough that maybe I could dress it up with cute boots and a scarf but I was very wrong.,54465,3
54466,My daughter is very slim and the dress was tight to go on,54466,3
54467,"I'm not sure if this is entirely a maternity dress, but it does stretch to fit my belly.",54467,3
54467,"The bottom of the dress rides up a bit to hit just below my butt, but I like that I can wear tight maternity dresses or those made of jersey material with this slip under it without seeing my underwear.",54467,3
54468,Looks like the pictures but definitely not made of t-shirt material.,54468,3
54468,"Feels like stretchy spandex material, which is kind of odd.",54468,3
54469,Returned due to a little small and zipper not great.,54469,3
54470,This runs a bit short in the leg.,54470,3
54470,"I am not particularly tall 5'5"", pretty average in fact, but it was short non the less.",54470,3
54471,"The product was made quite well, except the bra cups inside were placed rather high- closer to my collar bone than where they would need to be.",54471,3
54471,"However, that may have been related to the overall size issue.",54471,3
54471,"Based on the feedback, I ordered two sizes larger than I wear.",54471,3
54471,"It was still at least one size too small, probably 2.",54471,3
54472,I like the front of the necklace but hate the ribbon tie in the back (should be a chain or beads in the back).,54472,3
54473,"Too short for me at 5'7""",54473,3
54474,2 small bags are worthless but all others are good,54474,3
54475,If the dress were longer it would be perfect.,54475,3
54475,I am 5'9 and the front of the dress stopped at my underwear.,54475,3
54476,"beads are larger than i thought
may return",54476,3
54477,"Nice but really ran small, I wear a woman 12 & ordered this item in sz 3x & it fit  perfect no wiggle room",54477,3
54478,Nice dress but it looks nothing like the picture and the material is cheap and transparent.,54478,3
54479,"Bigger sizes should be a few inches longer so they will stay tucked in under a work shirt, but they feel good.",54479,3
54480,This is certainly not low rise unless you have a big butt!,54480,3
54480,It fits like a high waist jean and is a little loose for the size I ordered.,54480,3
54480,"I'm giving it 3 stars because the quality is ok for the price, even though the little elastic threads started showing after one wear.",54480,3
54480,Needed something for work so I suppose it will do.,54480,3
54481,3 stars because the shirt is nice quality but the fit is very strange.,54481,3
54481,Order at least one size up but understand that it's also long.,54481,3
54482,My daughter loved it.,54482,3
54483,The top is kind of thin and looser than expected.,54483,3
54483,I thought it would fit like a sports bra to help keep the girls in.,54483,3
54483,I will definitely need a support bra when I wear this.,54483,3
54483,The bottom part fits nicely around my hips (I have very wide hips).,54483,3
54484,Too small for my arm,54484,3
54486,"Didn't get my jacket until yesterday 18th Jan, placed the order 30th Nov.",54486,3
54486,Jacket is a little tight in the arms but otherwise it fits well.,54486,3
54486,A nice jacket for spring/summer,54486,3
54487,The glitter looks neat on it.,54487,3
54487,"It was way too small, and I'm not that big to begin with.",54487,3
54487,"The colors were real pretty, especially with the sparkles on the outer layer.",54487,3
54487,"The black part was way too small, and my armpits showed too much.",54487,3
54488,But the sizes run small.,54488,3
54489,"Ridiculously/Unbelievably Too Small, I wear XL or XXL
I Ordered XXXL and got XXXXL and it fits my little wife like it was tailored for her.",54489,3
54489,"(My L shirts that I can't wear anymore are baggy on her)
 If it didn't fit her so perfectly as an over a camisole shirt, since it is see-thru'.",54489,3
54489,it would have been returned.,54489,3
54489,"As a plus, it looks nice on her and gives a 3 star instead of 1",54489,3
54490,Not sure these are the original Lokai beads..I have one from the Lokai company and there's definitely a difference--but for the price it's a good knockoff.,54490,3
54492,More dressy than expected.,54492,3
54492,Material is thin and stiff.,54492,3
54493,The material felt amazing.,54493,3
54493,It was good  quality however  it was not the right size.,54493,3
54494,I ordered larger than I typically wear due to the reviews and theyr'e still small.,54494,3
54495,"The ring is cute, but the bow is much smaller than pictured.",54495,3
54496,It works ok but it was hard to get remote to fit in well.,54496,3
54496,Some of the outer trim was warped and it makes tough to close.,54496,3
54496,Once you get it in it fits tight and seems to do its job.,54496,3
54498,Love the case and.,54498,3
54498,The color was exactly how it looked on the computer .,54498,3
54498,It was missing the snap on own that held the projective glass protector.,54498,3
54498,That was the reason I choose this case and now I'm left without it.,54498,3
54499,"Does not for lose like the picture, its does not look bad though, just wish it fit  a little lose.",54499,3
54500,"Cute, buy hurt between my toes.",54500,3
54501,"I like the material, it feels like a linen.",54501,3
54501,"The slit on the side is a bit higher which I had to sew it so that my ""undies"" won't show .",54501,3
54501,"I think, the more I wash it, it's shrinking.",54501,3
54502,Super cool style and fit.,54502,3
54502,The material is a little on the cheap side.,54502,3
54502,I hope no one notices.,54502,3
54503,"Really comfy, but shrinks alot when washing.",54503,3
54503,"I am average height at 5ft 6inches, and with shrinkage it is almost too short in the legs now after a handful of washings.",54503,3
54503,"I have another pair of these in a different syle, and I haven't had the sam issues with that pair.",54503,3
54503,That pair was also longer to begin with.,54503,3
54505,Dress is see-thru and wasn't as puffy as I expected from reading some of the reviews but I like it.,54505,3
54506,It's made big and seems seen crooked.,54506,3
54506,If you're tiny and like big shirts you'll love it.,54506,3
54507,I didn't like the reddish color..It came quickly!,54507,3
54508,It's a OK quality,54508,3
54509,Beautiful but was too small for an extra large size and the man I got it for is 190lbs...not a real big guy!,54509,3
54510,It was cute but broke the second time I wore it.,54510,3
54510,I am not sure how but the pendant just disconnected from the rest of the choker and I was not handling it roughly.,54510,3
54510,I guess it's just poorly made.,54510,3
54510,Wouldn't recommend to a friend.,54510,3
54511,It's not as long as I expected it to be.,54511,3
54511,I wanted it to be long enough to wear over leggings but it's regular length like any other regular tank top you would buy.,54511,3
54512,"Nice jumper, but small in size",54512,3
54513,This onesie is cute but runs small.,54513,3
54513,I bought a size 6 months for a 2 month old thinking he could wear it this summer.,54513,3
54514,I loved this shirt at first but after like 3 washes the black bleed into the white and now it's some weird grey color,54514,3
54515,"The color isn't as muted as the picture suggests, it's bubblegum pink.",54515,3
54517,I have a slightly longer torso than this romper can accommodate.,54517,3
54517,"My torso is average, not super long, but this would fit better on someone shorter.",54517,3
54518,I Like the color of dress.,54518,3
54518,I'm glad that I read the reviews 1st and bought the dress a size larger than I usually buy.,54518,3
54518,I fit as expected.,54518,3
54518,The dress is comfortable and the quality is ok.,54518,3
54519,I wear a 36 bra and purchased the large.,54519,3
54519,"The material is nice enough, but the bra rolls at the band under the breasts, which is annoying.",54519,3
54519,It is good that the pad inserts are removable as they seem to run small.,54519,3
54519,"I found it comfortable and non-binding, but would not purchase again because of the band.",54519,3
54520,"It's not bad, just too large around the shoulders and too tight around the waist.",54520,3
54521,"Awesome shirt, way too small!",54521,3
54522,Beads are wayyyyyyyyyyyy small.,54522,3
54523,Do not wear this if you plan on going in any water.,54523,3
54523,It's definitely for show.,54523,3
54523,You have to put the top together.,54523,3
54523,"Literally, they just send a long piece of cloth to put together.",54523,3
54523,It's cute for parading around.,54523,3
54523,I don't like that I have to put it together.,54523,3
54523,No support for the boobs of course.,54523,3
54524,i had to cut off the clothe around my thighs it was to small!,54524,3
54524,the waist fit just as i expected but my thunder thighs were being coked to deaf so they had to go!,54524,3
54525,I wanted a hoddie that I could lounge around in during the summer.,54525,3
54525,This was ok. Not as lightweight as stated and runs very small.,54525,3
54525,I  usually wear small in Aeropostale hoddies but this was too tight for me.,54525,3
54525,Very snug on the shoulders and arms and a bit hard to zip.,54525,3
54525,This is one size fits all if you are very thin with a tiny chest and no jigglie bits.,54525,3
54525,The material  was cozy but it pulled very easily.,54525,3
54526,Fits alright nothing to fancy!,54526,3
54527,"Size small was too big for me, I'm 5'7"", lean 120 lbs.",54527,3
54529,"While I love the material of the bottom half (saying the bra/cup area is the top), there's a few things I didn't find amazing.",54529,3
54529,The strings attached are stitched on very poorly.,54529,3
54529,You can see the end of it dangling as well as numerous threads hanging off and it's so poorly attached it feels like it'll snap if you pull too tightly.,54529,3
54529,"Also, the fit is kind of awkward.",54529,3
54529,It's nowhere near as sheer as the photo so it's very a tight bra look with a very flowy skirt look.,54529,3
54529,Doesn't look as nicely when you have larger body since it doesn't hug your curves and makes you look kinda... fat.,54529,3
54529,Pretty sure the string problem can be fixed with proper sewing.,54529,3
54529,It's nice material but isn't as flattering as I hoped.,54529,3
54529,Came packaged really nicely though.,54529,3
54530,These gloves are not as warm as I had hoped.,54530,3
54530,I guess I will go and buy mittens for really long stretches in the bitter cold.,54530,3
54531,But looks like the real thing.,54531,3
54532,It's a cute shirt but runs very small.,54532,3
54532,I just returned it to order a size up.,54532,3
54533,I ordered size 35.,54533,3
54533,The label on the pants states size 34.,54533,3
54533,It is too small for me to wear comfortably.,54533,3
54533,Got it at the end of May.,54533,3
54534,Great colors runs small,54534,3
54535,Magnetic clasp is strong.,54535,3
54535,Decent value for the price.,54535,3
54536,"Fun good shirt,  great for the anti social,  material is soft and comfortable",54536,3
54537,Quite large in the bust.,54537,3
54537,I'll have to find a way to bring it in some or just give it to a friend.,54537,3
54538,The thong part is extremely rough between your toes.,54538,3
54540,The dress didn't fit me well.,54540,3
54540,im a large and it felt like a medium.,54540,3
54540,My daughter will love it.,54540,3
54541,"I ordered a small since I'm small-boned, but I think a medium would have been a better fit for me.",54541,3
54542,I wish it covered my forehead more but it certainly keeps me nice and warm on the shipping dock!,54542,3
54543,I got a large...  but it was more like a extra small on me :(  the sizing is completely off...,54543,3
54544,"Zipper broke first time wearing it, if it wasn't for that I'd probably really like the product for the price, very long and can wear with leggings.",54544,3
54545,I love these overalls however it is a junior size fit.,54545,3
54545,I should have ordered an extra large.,54545,3
54545,I typically wear a women's small or medium.,54545,3
54546,Size seems to be small,54546,3
54547,"I put on the navy pair and there was a run from the croch to the waist

Colors are great
Fit is awesome
Very comfy
Just wish they were more durable",54547,3
54548,"Really cheaply made, grommets come off pretty easily.",54548,3
54548,Not a huge fan,54548,3
54549,I am a small and this is too small.,54549,3
54549,"(5'8, 125lbs) Also the suit colors are not as saturated in real life.",54549,3
54549,The orange is a light peach color and the pattern isn't the same as the one in the picture.,54549,3
54549,The neck detailing us cut off of the pattern.,54549,3
54549,Very disappointing since the pictures are SO cute.,54549,3
54550,"I've had darker,but they fit great and look good",54550,3
54551,I bought them for my husband but they were too tight for his calves so he just folds them over.,54551,3
54552,"Fit true to size, but does not hold in like the bone in waist trainers, but they also hurt more.",54552,3
54552,This one is more comfortable.,54552,3
54554,I love the design for this bag.,54554,3
54554,"I don't really carry a lot of stuff with me, so the size of this bag is perfect.",54554,3
54554,I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.,54554,3
54554,The problem however is that after a few months the leather in the straps starts to unravel.,54554,3
54554,"I've tried several times to fix it, but it is very hard to get it back into place.",54554,3
54555,"Looked well made, but very small.",54555,3
54555,"My expectations were off, so its not fair to say anything negative about this product.",54555,3
54555,I was looking for a home shoe shine kit....full size.,54555,3
54556,These are so small that they are for little boys.,54556,3
54556,We will be requesting a refund.,54556,3
54556,"It was for my 13 year old son, so they are too small.",54556,3
54557,But for the price its ok,54557,3
54559,Cute and fit my daughter well but not really impressed with the quality.,54559,3
54559,The fabric isn't very soft.,54559,3
54559,The red on the pants doesn't match the top- it looks more orange than red.,54559,3
54559,I bought them a size up in hopes that she could wear them next Christmas too but I'm not sure now.,54559,3
54560,It has the adidas logo but is not an adidas.,54560,3
54560,I feel like I was tricked into buying them.,54560,3
54560,The sole is kinda flimsy.,54560,3
54560,They came from China.,54560,3
54560,Not sure how these are going to hold up with a very active child wearing them.,54560,3
54561,"I liked it, style and everything but it runs crazy small.",54561,3
54561,I had to give it to my niece.,54561,3
54562,"It was to small for me to like it - lol, But is great for the Grandbaby",54562,3
54563,Very large in the neck area but can be altered.,54563,3
54563,Beautiful and soft lace.,54563,3
54564,I like it but once you wash it a couple of times it looses its nice shape..that's the only problem... Just wash it by hand n also hang dry it to take care of it.,54564,3
54565,Nice printing and fit.,54565,3
54565,The only thing I did not liked where the openings on the side.,54565,3
54565,It is short and with the side openings hard to use without leggings,54565,3
54566,"All the shirts I ordered were the same size, but this one did not fit.",54566,3
54566,:-(  The other shirts are great.,54566,3
54567,The Mermaid image is not as clear as I hoped it would be.,54567,3
54567,The image isn't as vivid as shown.,54567,3
54568,"They were a little larger and heavier, but I like",54568,3
54570,It's cute but if you have boobs it won't fit at all.,54570,3
54570,I'm a size b cup and it hardly fits over my chest.,54570,3
54570,It's also sheer so I feel like I have to wear shorts under it.,54570,3
54571,The product came quickly.,54571,3
54571,The sizing was a bit snug.,54571,3
54571,The fabric was very thin.,54571,3
54571,"If there is any give in the fabric, the garment should be a nice weight for summer.",54571,3
54573,"They are cute, but so small for an adult.",54573,3
54573,"I gave them to my 6 year old son, he will enjoy them during the summer.",54573,3
54574,"Very small purse, too small for me.",54574,3
54574,"It's cute, but ultimately not what I was looking for.",54574,3
54575,I wish the outside skorts were a little bit heavier fabric.,54575,3
54575,They also run a bit shorter than I'd like.,54575,3
54575,"The inside ""shorts"" are made of a t-shirt type material and they are quite short and ride up the thighs very quickly.",54575,3
54575,The interior shorts should be made of same fabric and attach like a true skort (these are more like wearing soft short boy-short underwear attached to a skirt.,54575,3
54575,Skorts used to actually be shorts with an attached skirt.,54575,3
54575,"So, when you bend over, you're just looking at shorts, not looking at ""underwear"" which is what the interior material feels and looks like.",54575,3
54575,"When they say ""denim""-- they don't mean ""jeans"" type denim.",54575,3
54575,All of the shorts I got (3 colors) were very thin fabric.,54575,3
54575,"I would not order again, simply because of the fabrics used on the inside and outside, and the price.",54575,3
54575,I will try a different brand.,54575,3
54576,"Some what smaller than size says
But love design",54576,3
54577,"Very pretty, just as pictured, but broke fast.",54577,3
54578,Had to return it because it was way too small even though unordered 2 sizes up.,54578,3
54578,I normally love everything from Pakula when I order a size or 2 up.,54578,3
54578,This one was a miss though sadly :/,54578,3
54579,"very pretty, fabric is soft but fits small.",54579,3
54580,Its not a pocket watch its a pendant,54580,3
54581,A challenge to put in and too sheer to wear with just a tunic.,54581,3
54581,Must be worn under dress or pants,54581,3
54582,A little scratchy....not soft like I had expected.,54582,3
54582,"But, it is warm and comfortable.",54582,3
54583,I purchased this Versitile backpack/purse and ended up sending it back for a few reasons.,54583,3
54583,1) Very thick and therefore heavy.,54583,3
54583,2) While I appreciate the fact that the zipper pulls are long and you can enter the center and front pockets utilizing 2 pulls from the center and then zip down each side; I couldn't get past the heavy weight of this bag.,54583,3
54583,3) I felt that the material may scratch easy.,54583,3
54583,But I was concerned about daily use.,54583,3
54584,Too big and bulky for my daughters but the sellers were very easy to work with on the return!,54584,3
54585,"Pretty purse, just fell apart quickly.",54585,3
54586,It was hard to tell from the picture on Amazon but it is a tee shirt with the image printed on it.,54586,3
54586,My niece liked it so that is all that mattered.,54586,3
54587,The gold trim is a little shiner than I would have liked but it's very nice for the price.,54587,3
54588,Let me start with Size: All reviews are correct; go up several sizes.,54588,3
54588,"Here's how the XXL may fit you:
* I am a tall thin girl, size 8-10 US, and the XXL fits well.",54588,3
54588,"If you're any bigger than a size 12, this blouse won't fit
* My arms are a little heavy and the sleeveless openings are snug
* By bust is a 36/38 B and just fits.",54588,3
54588,"Anyone bigger won't fit
* My waste is very narrow and the material is generous on the sides (that was expected; I have the same issue with all blouses)
* My torso is really long and this top is actually long enough for me.",54588,3
54588,"Back of blouse hits right around mid-buttock like the one picture in red
* My hips are slightly larger than most, but the top falls perfectly over them.",54588,3
54588,"Slide slits will accommodate most hips

Now for the Quality:
* Its a blouse worth $16.99, no more or less
* The quality of the zipper is awful - it sticks, appears to be loosing teeth & barely works.",54588,3
54588,It will break shortly.,54588,3
54588,"Since a return was difficult and would take more time/money, I elected to keep the blouse.",54588,3
54588,Used a white crayon on the zipper to make it easier to move.,54588,3
54588,Ill have to replace it soon.,54588,3
54588,* The fabric is not breathable and not the most flexible spandex.,54588,3
54588,"Some loose threads, but not bad.",54588,3
54588,Frog closures and satin trim are nice.,54588,3
54588,Washes easily; did not put in the dryer.,54588,3
54590,It's cute and the size is fairly accurate but I'm busty.,54590,3
54590,I had to cut out the underwire and it still makes muy boobs look weird.,54590,3
54591,Way too small.... size chart no bueno....,54591,3
54593,To large had to send back.,54593,3
54594,Just got the jacket and it was way too wide.,54594,3
54594,"I'm 5'11"" 175lbs and from the other reviews I concluded I would probably need a large.",54594,3
54594,The picture makes the jacket look like a modern fit but it isn't.,54594,3
54594,It would probably be great for a more stout build.,54594,3
54595,Very disappointed in this item.,54595,3
54595,Not oversize at all.,54595,3
54595,"sleeves shorter  than shown,  more of a crop top.",54595,3
54595,keep it because it was good quality.,54595,3
54596,This jacket is somewhat small.,54596,3
54596,"It fits, but is snug.",54596,3
54597,Cheap import sized too small,54597,3
54598,2 pieces are big for me.,54598,3
54598,1 has sticky edge but overall ok for the price.,54598,3
54599,GREAT PRODUCT JUST GO SIZE UP.IT GIVES GREAT STOMACH FIGURE,54599,3
54600,"I got this product in a medium, and it was to small for me to deem wearable.",54600,3
54600,I fit the requirements for this product and the size.,54600,3
54600,I suggest getting the shirt in a larger size.,54600,3
54600,"Despite that flaw, the shirt is very soft and was comfortable.",54600,3
54602,I normally wear large and extra large tops.,54602,3
54602,This was extra large and it was way too small,54602,3
54603,"The cut is very blunt though, between the shorter front and longer back.",54603,3
54603,It is not a gradual cu.,54603,3
54603,Might look good with a skirt underneath with leggings.,54603,3
54603,Have to play around with it before I decide if I like it that much.,54603,3
54604,Poor quality but what can you expect for the price.,54604,3
54605,"It's a really pretty color, but the shirt was falling off of me.",54605,3
54606,"I'm 5'6"" 133lbs 34B/C bra athletic build and purchased a Medium.",54606,3
54606,"The underwire on the bra top did not sit right under the breast, so didn't cup me correctly.",54606,3
54606,The bottom piece was too big.,54606,3
54606,If I were a curvier girl with more hips to fill it out it may have fit better.,54606,3
54606,However if I had ordered the Small size the top would have been too snug.,54606,3
54606,"Sucks to send it back, so cute in person.",54606,3
54607,"I'm 5'10"" and a size 12, I ordered a large and the cover-up was to big.",54607,3
54607,"The quality was not as expected, really thin material.",54607,3
54607,The color was lighter than shown in the picture as well.,54607,3
54607,"I'm giving 3 stars because the return process was super easy, thanks!",54607,3
54608,The sizing on this is far too small.,54608,3
54608,I ordered an XL as I get XL everything else.,54608,3
54608,This is figure hugging.,54608,3
54608,"I would say it's not just one size too small, but 1.5 to x2 too small.",54608,3
54608,"Comparing this to say Haggar clothing, this would be a medium for sure.",54608,3
54608,I'm very disappointed with the sizing.,54608,3
54608,On no planet is this an regular XL.,54608,3
54609,its good for the price.,54609,3
54609,the stitching is okay.,54609,3
54609,there are a couple of areas that are not perfect sewn.,54609,3
54610,I ordered this dress according to the size chart to wear to church lets just say it was see through and fit  more like a club dress to me.,54610,3
54610,I'm still going wear it just going to add tights.,54610,3
54611,Around the arm pits and the shoulders won't fit well for a athletic body.,54611,3
54612,Doesn't come down far enough to your pants.,54612,3
54613,"Nice color, itchy material and feels a bit cheap.",54613,3
54614,Bought it for a 2 year old - her mom loved it.,54614,3
54615,"Beautiful, light weight shirt.",54615,3
54615,I normally wear a small but i ordered a large for a comfortable fit.,54615,3
54615,"Not oversized at all, but a more classic fit.",54615,3
54615,"I am 5'2"" tall weighing 135lbs.",54615,3
54615,"This shirt had a few ""mislabels"" eg.",54615,3
54615,"the brand name was not ""J. TOMSON"" as in the picture but instead it was ""WAX JEAN"".",54615,3
54615,This doesn't matter much since both labels are not well known.,54615,3
54615,The other mislabel was inside where it says the shirt is 100% cotton.,54615,3
54615,The description on amazon says its about 70% cotton and 30% lyocell (which i prefer).,54615,3
54615,The lyocell mix will reduce the shrinkage and reduce wrinkling.,54615,3
54615,The actual shirt fabric has some north south stretch so i am inclined to think that the label on the actual shirt is wrong.,54615,3
54615,I am very happy with the shirt otherwise and love the comfortable fit.,54615,3
54615,I would recommend sizing up because the shoulder seam in the back will feel a bit snug if you have average to wide shoulders.,54615,3
54615,I just ordered a few more of these shirts in different colors because i think I'll get a lot of wear over spring and summer.,54615,3
54615,UPDATE: washes like 100% cotton.,54615,3
54616,Well made and cute straps are a little flimsy but all in all cute and perfect fit.,54616,3
54617,I wear medium tops and with this I would say I should have gotten a large as it runs super small like won't even go around my daughter than is super small she wears a small top and thus won't zip up on her so make sure what ever your size is to go bigger just in case but with right size works great!,54617,3
54618,looks very sexy and realfitzwelllook just like the picture,54618,3
54619,For the price it's fine.,54619,3
54620,"Ordered 2 sizes bigger and it's still tight, but nice jacket just order 3 sizes larger",54620,3
54621,"Cool pants, a large fits like a small.",54621,3
54621,Not exactly how I expected the pants to fit.,54621,3
54621,but I'll make them work.,54621,3
54622,It gets a crease in it if you sit or wear it for more then about 3 hours.,54622,3
54622,Its great for right after you have a baby but I only wore it for about 4 days.,54622,3
54622,"Its something you can wear while your standing, but if sitting it get a crease in it, when the wrap is suppost to stay stiff/straight",54622,3
54624,The cup size is too large.,54624,3
54624,The bodice is perfect.,54624,3
54625,"Cute pattern, arrived as promised, however, considering the price there should be an option of regular or tall for men and women.",54625,3
54626,I didn't realize it was sheer; I will have to wear a tank top under it.,54626,3
54627,The sleeves are little short for me.,54627,3
54628,"It looks good, fabric is a bit shiny.",54628,3
54628,"I'm 5.7"" tall but the legs are too long so end up folding up around my ankle.",54628,3
54629,next time i will get a large.,54629,3
54629,but i liked these alot - built in panties too -,54629,3
54630,"Too expensive,wrinkles at first hour of wearing.",54630,3
54630,Not worth the price,54630,3
54632,Bought these for my little sister for Christmas.,54632,3
54632,When they arrived they looked worn.,54632,3
54632,There were creases on the back of the knees and what looked like foundation on the one leg.,54632,3
54632,I washed them and they were fine.,54632,3
54632,But they were definitely worn.,54632,3
54633,I bought this for my daughter and it fit way more narrow in the chest (showed too much of the side of her chest) than pictured.,54633,3
54634,"Jacket (size xs- I'm 5'3"" 115) was way too large.",54634,3
54634,Had to return and service was fine when doing so.,54634,3
54635,it is cut low on the side so my bra shows on the side,54635,3
54636,"Good fit it is it's true size but it may be loose in some areas and tighter in others, I'm making it work because I love the colors and the style",54636,3
54637,Loved it but the breast part was for a medium size woman I got a 14/16 was a little big but it had a comfortable fit to it,54637,3
54638,Is good but not of the top .,54638,3
54639,Strap is weak but over all cute little bag.,54639,3
54640,Be warned there is zipper in back that is hard to reach.,54640,3
54641,Material is scratchy and crunchy.,54641,3
54642,"Outfit is cute, but the cut if the shirt was definitely more of a little girls style and the coloring of the pants was more of a maroon than orange.",54642,3
54643,Lots of fun but the wires are a mess inside the sweater.,54643,3
54644,It was OK for the price,54644,3
54645,"The lining is too short, only about to the waist.",54645,3
54646,Scratchy material but good for athletic compression applications.,54646,3
54646,If you want a soft feel order Saxx Fiesta or pro Elite underwear because they  are very soft inside.,54646,3
54647,"Product was nice, but the sizing was very small!",54647,3
54648,As they all say they're bigger than what you expect.,54648,3
54649,"I really like them, but they have a chemical smell that has not faded much even after several washings.",54649,3
54649,"If you are not sensitive to that, then they are warm and comfortable.",54649,3
54650,High waist was unexpected.,54650,3
54650,Doesn't drape very well.,54650,3
54651,"the top runs small and the skirt is way to long I'm almost 5,8"" and with 4 inch heels it still drags on the ground",54651,3
54652,"still breaking in the straps, rubbed in between my toe the first coup[le of days.",54652,3
54653,good for nite bed ware.,54653,3
54654,Material is good for warm weathers.,54654,3
54654,The white is pure white but cream white.,54654,3
54654,Be careful on how you wash it.,54654,3
54654,Materil is thin but overall i like it alot,54654,3
54655,Makes me look heavy,54655,3
54657,I had to sew  it as soon as got it and its a bit itchy.. Other then that its pretty cute,54657,3
54658,"if you have a short torso, this will be too big (I'm 5'2"")& the bottom area is not the same cut as the picture and makes you have a weird butt.",54658,3
54658,"Since it was soooo cheap, I'm not going to buy another one and just wear this for halloween and make it work by sewing a bit of bodysuit together so it'll be smaller.",54658,3
54658,worth it if you're only planning on wearing this once or twice.,54658,3
54658,NOT reliable as a bathing suit because its way too thin and the material is cheap.,54658,3
54658,get what you pay for though.,54658,3
54659,The shirt looks longer on here.,54659,3
54659,Once received its wide and the sleeves are short.,54659,3
54659,Don't like it at all.,54659,3
54660,This dress poofs out in the waist which makes it look really weird.,54660,3
54660,Great for pregnant ladies or if you just ate a whole burrito.,54660,3
54660,I tried wearing it with a belt (free fashion tip) and it made it look a little better.,54660,3
54660,Not really worth it though.,54660,3
54661,The necklace is as shown in the picture however the picture portrays the necklace to be better quality then it is in real life.,54661,3
54661,Te chains are deffinatly cheaper and the small disk on the middle chain is very small and dainty.,54661,3
54661,I say go for a better quality product even though this price is a good price.,54661,3
54662,I bought these for a friend but he said they are more like dress socks than casual lower cut socks,54662,3
54665,Too hard to fit on arm.,54665,3
54666,I wanted to cover more my booty but it is too short.,54666,3
54667,"In the picture the fringe looked cute, when I got in and opened my package I was disappointed in it.",54667,3
54669,These broke after the second time of me wearing them.,54669,3
54670,"While these get the job done hiding areas that are better covered up, the material is thin and they run super small.",54670,3
54670,They are not stretchy spandex like I expected.,54670,3
54670,You will need to size up at least two sizes.,54670,3
54671,"I previously ordered this hat in the Dark Gray which fit perfectly, I love it.",54671,3
54671,"I ordered the black and the fit was totally different fit, it was too big..",54671,3
54671,I was a bit disappointed but will keep hopefully washing it will shrink it.,54671,3
54672,They were cute pants it's to bad they were way to small a size 3 fit like a size 1,54672,3
54673,It was a little snug,54673,3
54674,The socks are stretchy so the picture stretches out.,54674,3
54675,the material doesnt really have any give to it.,54675,3
54675,its kinda thick and clingy.,54675,3
54676,This dress is kind of a mess.,54676,3
54676,It definitely doesn't look as elegant as the picture shows.,54676,3
54676,"There are also ridiculously large, oddly shaped cups sewn into the chest.",54676,3
54676,"I'm a busty woman (32FF), and it was swimming in the chest on me, despite mostly fitting everywhere else.",54676,3
54676,"I would definitely only order this if you can get it with free returns, and I'd order several other options along with it.",54676,3
54677,"Aside from that, made very well.",54677,3
54679,"Quality not the best, but was expected for the price.",54679,3
54679,Ripped a Lil when I pulled one of the strings on to tighten on waist.,54679,3
54680,I received this earlier than I expected as it was shipping from overseas.,54680,3
54680,The shirt is not as long as it looks in the picture.,54680,3
54680,The fabric on the inside is very soft and comfortable.,54680,3
54680,I am 5'8 and the one size fits all landed about 10 inches above my belly button.,54680,3
54680,"It is a beautiful shirt, but I cannot wear it because it looks awkwardly small on me.",54680,3
54681,Dress is adorable but fits like a medium in width but more like a long shirt in length.,54681,3
54681,"I'm 5'9 and it was WAY, WAY to short to even think of wearing it as a dress.",54681,3
54682,This wire necklace doesn't lay flat on my neck.,54682,3
54682,The pendant is kinda dangling.,54682,3
54682,If it laid flat it would be great but as it is I really can't use it.,54682,3
54683,"I have a full bottom so, it was a little weird.",54683,3
54683,"If you have a big bootie, you may need to go a size larger if you want it to flow like in the pic.",54683,3
54684,Was a gift and was pretty but very stiff and kinda cheap looking.,54684,3
54684,Thinking it was made more for teenagers.,54684,3
54685,Can't wear it too small,54685,3
54686,"I've trusted Woolrich for durability and lasting quality...Cocoon Rain Coat, CLOVE - not so impressed.",54686,3
54686,Color varies depending on ambient light - green to yellow-green ochre.,54686,3
54686,If you are size S order M / if size M order  L.  It runs small!,54686,3
54686,The narrow shaping at bottom is constricting if you take a moderate stride.,54686,3
54686,"Open the back snap, still binds when you walk - anywhere!",54686,3
54686,It is lightweight for spring summer use.,54686,3
54686,HOW do I return/exchange this??,54686,3
54687,Liked the dress but did not work.,54687,3
54688,Pretty but too too short of you are tall (5'7 and up do not buy),54688,3
54689,Not bad buy but it is a dollar type necklace I guess you pay the extra amount because they shipped it free,54689,3
54690,Love the socks and patterns.,54690,3
54690,Wish they were a bit longer... After washing I gave them to my wife!,54690,3
54691,"First, it took almost two weeks to receive this Prime 2 day item.",54691,3
54691,"Second, I'm having a difficult time separating the plastic strip from the adhesive without destroying the foam lining.",54691,3
54691,Once the plastic strip is off it does the job it's intended to do.,54691,3
54692,To ordered it 2 sizes up so it would fit oversized and it fitted like a large.,54692,3
54693,The design of this bathing suit is beautiful.,54693,3
54693,But it runs extremely small.,54693,3
54693,I am a 4-6 but this did not fit me.,54693,3
54693,"Also, the chest part is bear and does not have any padding, FYI.",54693,3
54693,I decided to order this since I had a baby and have a few stretch marks at the bottom of my stomach.,54693,3
54693,If the design would have fit it would have been a very nice bathing suit.,54693,3
54694,After many requests for my opinion on  BOOTLACES...,54694,3
54694,"I have to say these are the best shoelaces available to mankind
 It would be a mistake to buy these shoes laces from any one else!",54694,3
54695,Nice frame for the price.,54695,3
54696,"Several of them lost ""gems"" or glitter just trying to remove them from the plastic film.",54696,3
54696,A few have already been rendered unwearable from this.,54696,3
54697,Dissapointed on my buy they are made out of the most brittle plastic ive be surprised if they last me a month feels like a toy i mean they look good but they feel like cheap chinesse plastic won't buy glasses from amazon again after this rather go to Venice Beach and get two for twenty and they are better made :( :( :(,54697,3
54698,Honestly the most comfy boxers ever but the tag edges are itchy and irritate my skin.,54698,3
54698,I ordered the right size but it's just the edges are sharp on the tag and I wish they were tag less,54698,3
54699,Pretty short waisted after a washing.,54699,3
54699,Kind of expected that so can't balme the manufacturer.,54699,3
54701,"I have a wide foot, so I could not even get these on.",54701,3
54701,"There is nothing wrong with the shoe, I just couldn't get it on.",54701,3
54703,There needs to be a better description of size.,54703,3
54704,It doesn't fit as I expected.,54704,3
54704,Too tight in in all the wrong places and too large in other places.,54704,3
54704,Overall it's a weird fit but the quality of the garment is good.,54704,3
54705,I ordered this for my best friend who is a 30 year young woman.,54705,3
54705,"However, it ended up fitting her 10 year young daughter.",54705,3
54705,"So, win win for me either way.",54705,3
54706,This is good looking belt buckle that works well.,54706,3
54706,"It is not super thick, but not flimsy either.",54706,3
54706,The construction is adequate.,54706,3
54706,"It's an ""ok"" product that gets the job done.",54706,3
54707,The frames and glasses were really big on my face.,54707,3
54707,"I think I have a round face, so I thought it would fit well, but these glasses are a bit bigger and more trendy than the style i needed.",54707,3
54707,"If you are looking for a professional/ classic style, you may want to skip this style.",54707,3
54707,"The wire that goes across the top it unnecessary, i felt.",54707,3
54708,It was pretty but did not fit like it should have as was advertised.,54708,3
54710,These shoes are a pain in the butt to get on and off of a small person's foot.,54710,3
54710,The shoe laces did not last very long.,54710,3
54710,The shoe held up for about 3-4 months.,54710,3
54710,Worth the price that was paid.,54710,3
54711,Didn't like the sleeve,54711,3
54712,"They stretch out in the pool, and hang down to my lower thigh...almost to the knee!",54712,3
54712,"The fit is great when dry, but when they hit the water, they sure get stretchy.",54712,3
54713,This is a nice item- but cheaper made than it looked - but I guess matched the price.,54713,3
54713,It runs much smaller than what I expected.,54713,3
54713,And shipping was slow,54713,3
54714,I was looking for a lightweight set of tights for lounging/sleeping during the summer and maybe outdoor wear under clothes in the winter.,54714,3
54714,These fit the bill well.,54714,3
54714,They seem to be well-constructed and of good quality and are very comfortable.,54714,3
54714,"I don't have power lifter thighs, so they are a little loose in that area.",54714,3
54714,"Aside from that, the fit was good.",54714,3
54714,"Addition:  Now that I've worn them a few times, they seem to be losing their mojo.",54714,3
54714,Looser than before and riding up at the ankles.,54714,3
54715,"Loved the pattern/print, liked the material, disappointed with the fit.",54715,3
54715,"I ordered a large and I'm 5'6, 170, 34D, small waist approx.",54715,3
54715,"29 inches, hips approx.",54715,3
54715,"The bottoms fit great, I have no worries/issues with the bikini bottoms.. however the top was the major issue.",54715,3
54715,"As others said before me, it's a wrap and it almost wasn't long enough for me to wrap around myself (I really had to stretch it).",54715,3
54715,Furthermore the placement of a seam is located right in the middle of the wrap making it look unattractive.,54715,3
54715,"Also the lining of this particular wrap is white while the outside print is leopard and because the way in which you have to tie the wrap around you, the lining shows.",54715,3
54715,"Even though I kept tucking and turning the lining over, it would still eventually show and that just ain't cute.",54715,3
54715,"I really wanted to like this so I would keep it, but both times I tried it on, there was too much manipulation I had to do to keep my breast from popping out and hide the lining, which only stayed in place as long as I didn't do too much movement.",54715,3
54715,"Maybe an all black suit would of alleviated the issue with the lining and possibly hid the seam, but the wrap still would have been a little too small and causing a lot of pulling and stretching to be properly wrapped... maybe I'll try again with the black but I really wanted this leopard print to work... it was just OK...",54715,3
54716,"the chain popped and my grand baby is wearing the pendant in her pocket, needless to say I felt betrayed.",54716,3
54716,her twin still has hers around her neck.,54716,3
54717,She was very pleased with fit and feel!,54717,3
54718,Soft.... Fun.... Good fit.. Like to get red pair.,54718,3
54719,Did not look like the picture at all in person!!!,54719,3
54719,"The picture made the top look like it has a little shine to the material and even the embroidery looked very nice, but when I opened the box I was disappointed.",54719,3
54719,Looked like a thin tee shirt with a little cheap frill.,54719,3
54720,Good for a child,54720,3
54721,I was very excited when my backpack arrived 2 weeks early!,54721,3
54721,It's well made inside/out and exactly how I pictured.,54721,3
54721,My only wish was that it was bigger so I could use it as my commuter/laptop bag.,54721,3
54721,The only real bummer was it arrived with a good size dent in the bottom corner from shipping (see photo).,54721,3
54721,My hope is that it flattens out or I won't use it at all.,54721,3
54721,I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the dent.,54721,3
54722,"Very cute but way too small, even for my 18 month old who doesn't have a particularly large head.",54722,3
54722,"It still fits but looks way too short, like tweedle dee or tweedle dum...",54722,3
54723,"A little small
Doesn't fit all wrist sizes",54723,3
54724,"these shoes are adorable BUT  the elastic across the top of the foot was too tight and we had to buy a larger size shoe to compensate...so she had more than enough room in the foot area....they were very pretty, and otherwise great.",54724,3
54724,Luckily they shipped quickly!,54724,3
54725,"there wasn't a sizing chart so I took a chance
not the worst but not great",54725,3
54726,I didn't realize the back of the shirt is white.,54726,3
54727,It's too tight for me.,54727,3
54728,"Not bad, elastic is a little uncomfortable after a day of wear but it is breathable and very soft.",54728,3
54729,"I Ordered this dress to work with a blazer or jacket on top because I knew from the beginning it would be kind of revealing in the chest and back area, but I can't wear it in the office because ITS NOT A MIDI DRESS, its short and I'm 5'6 so I'm not a tall girl.",54729,3
54729,maybe for someone with 5'2 could be MIDI....,54729,3
54729,"I'm giving it three stars because still cute but I don't need another ""party"" dress or a dress to going out, I ordered this to work and it didn't' make it purpose.",54729,3
54730,for some reason they make my feet tired early on.,54730,3
54730,Can't wear them for long.,54730,3
54731,Well made but very very small for the size,54731,3
54732,Would have preferred bigger crystal and less chain.,54732,3
54733,"It's fine, expensive for just heavy card stock and a clip.",54733,3
54733,I could have made this myself,54733,3
54734,It's nice but I don't like the having to tie in the back,54734,3
54735,I wasn't happy with the way it fit or the quality of the garment,54735,3
54736,Seems kinda cheap after a few watches.,54736,3
54737,Came quickly as promised.,54737,3
54737,I little cheaper looking than I expected.,54737,3
54738,Bulkier than I thought 0 Coin pocket tore within 2 weeks,54738,3
54740,It's pretty but the bust is too tight,54740,3
54741,bigger than i expected,54741,3
54742,Ordered large and they are actually way to small.,54742,3
54743,"Comfortable, looks good with leggings",54743,3
54744,Thin and too small,54744,3
54745,Its a little small for the size.,54745,3
54745,And one small spot on the waist has a hole in the stitching.,54745,3
54745,"I stitched it back up myself, but it is a bit small.",54745,3
54745,"Other than that, it is a nice shirt with a very good, rich black color.",54745,3
54745,And the material is very nice and thick.,54745,3
54746,It was GORGEOUS ... For the first 5 minutes.,54746,3
54746,"I put it on, then one of the krystals fall out.",54746,3
54746,"I wear a little longer, and another one falls out.",54746,3
54746,U know what I do?,54746,3
54746,I go ahead a tear the rest of them off..,54746,3
54746,It doesn't look bad now actually.,54746,3
54746,Its not as pretty as it was but I still get tons of compliments on it so I can't complain too much.,54746,3
54746,It does have a cheap structure though.,54746,3
54747,"Super cute dress, but the bottom wrinkles terribly!",54747,3
54748,The size and materials were good.,54748,3
54748,"I tried to exchange it for a larger size and the company wanted me to return it for 60% of what I paid and pay for the shipping, plus I'd have to order another.",54748,3
54748,"For the shady customer service, it's a 0-1, but for the product itself.",54748,3
54748,"It was nice, so I gave it to my coworker who is slightly smaller than me.",54748,3
54749,The dress is pretty,54749,3
54750,more like a pj shirt,54750,3
54751,Smaller than the others.,54751,3
54752,I would love it if the material was not scratchy and uncomfortable.,54752,3
54752,"The bottom rolls up constantly, whether that is because of my figure or the material i do not know, but it was short on me, even with high waist jeans.",54752,3
54752,I hate hate hate pulling my shirt down every five seconds!!!,54752,3
54752,"That may be a personal problem, don't know.",54752,3
54752,"My very personal opinion is that if you are going to make and sell t shirts, it would be a great idea to make them out of good material, long enough to cover the average waist, and not have wood chips in the fabric.",54752,3
54752,Its a tee shirt!,54752,3
54752,"I mean, if that is what you are going to manufacture and sell, wouldn't you want to make something that people are going to buy?",54752,3
54752,There are a billion tee shirts on Amazon alone!,54752,3
54752,Why cheap out and lose business?,54752,3
54753,"It is large enough, but pretty SHORT  (whereas it looked as a long enough t-shirt on the picture).",54753,3
54753,I expected it to cover the hips but it does not which is disappointing.,54753,3
54753,The fabric is nice tough.,54753,3
54754,The picture is a true representative of the top and its color.,54754,3
54754,I have worn and washed this top three times since I got it and it looks just as when I got it.,54754,3
54754,"The only drawbacks for me is that it can be a little warm as the material doesn't seem to ""breathe"" and the tie in front does not stay tied [which is just a minor nuisance].",54754,3
54755,I sent these back because they have to much velcro and made my feet to bulky looking.,54755,3
54755,Love Vionic and the support they give in a sandal!,54755,3
54756,Peru lad grin size .,54756,3
54757,Loved the suit enough to buy another but the underwire came out after one wash.,54757,3
54757,Fingers crossed for better luck with this one!,54757,3
54758,I bought this for a Halloween costume because tights were too see-through and I have several large tattoos on my legs.,54758,3
54758,"These were still a bit see through, but probably less than tights would have been.",54758,3
54758,The color was a bit pinker than it appeared in the picture  (I bought the orange ones).,54758,3
54758,"I probably won't wear them again, but it's not really their fault.",54758,3
54759,Love the shape and style of this but it's a little too short & it's totally polyester!,54759,3
54760,I liked this dress but the design on the chest dosnt set like the picture I ironed it to set but still it folds over .,54760,3
54760,And where the zipper is on the love handles it sticks out making you look bigger .,54760,3
54760,Could of been made better for hat price .,54760,3
54762,Once this gets wet it is through.,54762,3
54762,I can see my grandchild's butt crack .,54762,3
54762,but she loves the mere maid look and she only swims in our private  pool so we will let it be.,54762,3
54762,I removed the stiches in front to fit her flat chest.,54762,3
54764,The sizing is quite small...order at least one size up.,54764,3
54765,Great backpack but stitching gave way on one strap within 2 weeks of purchase.,54765,3
54766,This is sized for an adult,54766,3
54767,"It keeps me warm, not the best fit, but it will do.",54767,3
54768,run a little tight for my son.,54768,3
54768,he is 13 months old and we bought 24 month shorts and it is still snuggy.,54768,3
54769,I love the texture but its a little too roomy for me.,54769,3
54769,Cap sleeve are much shorter than they appear in the photo.,54769,3
54770,I liked the material but it is to small,54770,3
54772,I cut more threads on this dress than if I would have made it myself.,54772,3
54773,"I ordered a small, I'm 120lbs size C in bra.",54773,3
54773,"It was very sheer, thin material(3expect for the price) and fit a little more loose that I had expected but I still like it.",54773,3
54773,I ordered a black shirt and they sent me a grey one.,54773,3
54773,Took about a month to get here.,54773,3
54773,"For the price is good,",54773,3
54774,"In all fairness, it is an adult product and I purchased it for my 6 year old",54774,3
54775,The quality is not the best and the price was not worth it.,54775,3
54775,"The fit is great, material thin and they roll up a little.",54775,3
54775,They are comfortable and they move with you and don't bunch up in the private area.,54775,3
54776,I liked it but the bottom fit too small.,54776,3
54776,It cut into my hips.,54776,3
54776,I have to lose a little extra to be able to wear it.,54776,3
54776,The top part fit amazing though.,54776,3
54777,"This was very cute, but the top comes as a scarf and is very confusing as to how to wrap it because it seems as though it's not long enough..",54777,3
54777,Sadly I returned it.,54777,3
54779,The material is a bit flimsy and snags a bit on the collar,54779,3
54780,"Cute outfit, great quality material but the boob part was too small.",54780,3
54781,The bra has no padding which I personally don't like.,54781,3
54781,Also the shorts were a big around the waist.,54781,3
54782,"Mediocre sunglasses, for the price it is a good product.",54782,3
54783,Shirt met my expectations.,54783,3
54783,Sizes run a little bigger than I'm used to.,54783,3
54783,"That's my fault , not the maker.",54783,3
54784,The leather is a little shiny and looks like plastic.,54784,3
54784,It is roomy and holds all the required items.,54784,3
54784,My son is happy with it.,54784,3
54785,Does get very hot to wear.,54785,3
54786,The bra is perfect but the bottom part i ordered a small one and its like a large,54786,3
54787,I don't know if it's really sterling but it is definitely pretty.,54787,3
54788,This came in only one size.,54788,3
54788,It is very snug on me.,54788,3
54788,It is tight in my upper arms but Im on a weight lose regimen and hope it will fit me perfectly in a month or so.,54788,3
54788,It is really pretty and the lace is soft.,54788,3
54788,Its like wearing lace stockings.,54788,3
54788,I like the soft fabric against my skin.,54788,3
54788,I received it about 2 weeks sooner than expected.,54788,3
54789,was to small for mr and I do not know how I can do.,54789,3
54790,Very cute just chain looks a Lil cheap but very cute for the price,54790,3
54791,Pretty much just a pretty printed poncho with buttons...,54791,3
54791,But I like it.,54791,3
54792,"They are pretty nice, however, I must have got a bad set of the blue ones because they are so thin at the edges that it's created a knife edge and I don't want to cut my ears so I don't wear them, hopefully the company will replace them for me",54792,3
54793,"Cute shoes, but the pom-poms fell off in a matter of hours.",54793,3
54793,"Other than that, my 5 year old is really enjoying them.",54793,3
54794,"My son reported, that the handle was too large.",54794,3
54794,"Also, he had expected the red ""sides"" could also fold in.",54794,3
54795,"The material feels similar to lycra, like the kind used in gymnastics outfits.",54795,3
54795,I don't wear it often but the design is cool so I kept it.,54795,3
54795,Just don't really like the feeling on my skin.,54795,3
54795,Would have been better and maybe more vibrant on a cotton shirt.,54795,3
54796,I love the earrings however one of the diamond stud in the one pair fell out so I had to hot glue it back in its place no one didn't notice and they turned out great but that was the only flaw in the earrings.,54796,3
54797,Nice dress just runs really small,54797,3
54798,"The necklace is good, but the earrings are bad, broken.",54798,3
54800,The plastic is a little stiff making the zippers a little hard to open.,54800,3
54801,fabric not good quality,54801,3
54802,cheap price but stones were very dull and easily fell off,54802,3
54803,cute colors but I ordered my regular Hudson size and these were way too big!,54803,3
54803,I'd order one size down.,54803,3
54803,Other than that cute fun style.,54803,3
54804,Just received this case for several days.,54804,3
54804,It feels secure and is not too bulky.,54804,3
54804,"However, the silicon sleeve is too loose which drags on the hard shell case whenever you need to use the phone.",54804,3
54804,It is difficult to slide the phone out to answer a call or to type a text message.,54804,3
54804,"Otherwise, it seems to provide good protection to the phone.",54804,3
54805,"Can't beat the price for how many you get, wasn't quite what I thought though.",54805,3
54805,"The ball on the end is so small they are very easy to pull out accidentally, however I just keep case in my purse and put a new one in once it gets pulled out- when you get that many I guess it doesn't really matter?",54805,3
54806,It's not linen - more like a heavy cotton.,54806,3
54806,It's nothing special - just okay,54806,3
54808,Purchased dress while I was in my second trimester.,54808,3
54808,It's lightweight and pattern/colors are OK.,54808,3
54808,The fit seemed to be lacking something...it just kind of hung.,54808,3
54808,This dress was returned.,54808,3
54809,"The top is a great fit, the bottoms are WAY too small.",54809,3
54811,"It's okay, but not for me.",54811,3
54811,"The size going by the size chart was skimpy, but the next size would be too big.",54811,3
54811,Otherwise it looked ok quality.,54811,3
54811,"Nicely packaged, with each bikini brief individually packaged.",54811,3
54811,Too bad it didn't work out.,54811,3
54812,"Great jumper, i love the design but the quality of the jumper is a little too light for my liking.",54812,3
54813,Thought this gown would be heavier than it is and it's not well made.,54813,3
54813,Also it runs about two sizes too large.,54813,3
54813,Will give to hospice.,54813,3
54814,"Cheaply made, ""blade"" bends too easily.",54814,3
54814,But it served it's purpose for a Halloween costume.,54814,3
54815,it is not luminous!!,54815,3
54815,there is no way to see it in the dark,54815,3
54817,The material wasn't the same as I expected,54817,3
54818,"This tops fits fine, I just don't care for the material which is not so good for summer wear.",54818,3
54819,Not really a fan.,54819,3
54819,If you like that type of high and stiff front area then you'll love it.,54819,3
54819,fit is as expected as far as size goes.,54819,3
54821,I am not a large girl but the large is small and fits very tight,54821,3
54822,I can't keep it untangled.,54822,3
54823,Not what I was expecting,54823,3
54824,This dress had the potential to be cute if I had wanted to take it in for major alterations.,54824,3
54824,Way too big all over.,54824,3
54825,Nice material but was too small,54825,3
54826,I liked it but the clasp is a little to large,54826,3
54827,"seems well enough made, just runs very small, and we even tried to take that into account....",54827,3
54828,"Cool shirt, but way too small!",54828,3
54828,Arms felt kind of restrictive,54828,3
54829,"The bottoms come up a little too high for me in the front, but other than that I love it!!!",54829,3
54829,I recommend ordering one size bigger too because it does shrink some in the dryer but not bad enough to where it will be too small.,54829,3
54830,They run really small order a size bigger.,54830,3
54831,"The case is a good case; however, the mirror is not a real mirror.",54831,3
54831,I'm not sure what type material it is.,54831,3
54831,The mirror looks like a used product that was glued on the inside flap.,54831,3
54831,I thought maybe it just needed a good cleaning; but it looked exactly the same afterwards.,54831,3
54831,I was going to give as an additional add on gift but the mirror makes it appear I'm giving a used product.,54831,3
54833,"They are well made and pretty, but they are huge.",54833,3
54833,The model looks like a size 0 or 2.,54833,3
54833,The socks do not fit legs for those sizes.,54833,3
54833,"They are very loose, and I would say easily made for an 8 or above.",54833,3
54833,You have to shrink them in the dryer.,54833,3
54833,"They are nice, though.",54833,3
54833,"I wear them everyday, but they don't come as is.",54833,3
54834,A little on the short side leg length-wise.,54834,3
54834,"Not too much, but i'm sure it'll shrink even more after i wash it.",54834,3
54835,"Very cute shirt however; I ordered a large just to be on the safe side, it fits like a small.",54835,3
54837,"I love the feel of this dress, but the size is off go a size bigger than you are.",54837,3
54838,Do not last very long.,54838,3
54839,Happy with the pants but disappointed no pockets.,54839,3
54840,It looks like a costume jewelry.,54840,3
54841,"for the price it did it's job for a few months, and sometimes that's all you need to get started.",54841,3
54841,Thanks for the low price.,54841,3
54841,will rebuy else where,54841,3
54842,The dress is nice but the color is not a light PINK as shown in the picture.,54842,3
54842,It is more of a coral/mauve color.,54842,3
54842,It will work...but was disappointed that it was not the color expected.,54842,3
54842,The dress is pretty long too.,54842,3
54842,I am going to have to have it altered to shorten it up a bit.,54842,3
54842,My daughter is tall (5'9) and it hit at her knee.,54842,3
54842,"We were expecting it to be above the knee, especially considering her height and long legs.",54842,3
54842,SIzing is pretty spot on.,54842,3
54842,She is a 3/5 so we ordered the 4 and it fit perfect.,54842,3
54842,I am mostly disappointed in the color though.,54842,3
54843,"I love the look, but like all the others I've bought it seems to fit a teenager!",54843,3
54843,Too tight for someone who actually has calves.,54843,3
54844,Color true to pic but was very large and fabric felt like that of a parachute.,54844,3
54845,Cute but tassel broke off easily.,54845,3
54845,Now there is an obvious gap between button and tassel line.,54845,3
54845,I tried closing gap with decorative pin but doesn't look right.,54845,3
54845,I'll try to belt it,54845,3
54846,"The string broke, but really I was more interested in the pendant.",54846,3
54846,"The silver part of the pendant is not sterling and will turn green, but otherwise it's pretty.",54846,3
54847,They look great but they're very tight...I got a large and normally I'd be a medium but the large even seem very small...I do love the material though so hopefully they stretch after washing them!,54847,3
54848,Cute for couples !,54848,3
54848,Got for myself an my husband an the words on the bracelet its self faded so it just looks like a plain bracelet but good quality over all.,54848,3
54849,"The front pouch is a bit snug, and the waistband/drawstring gets all twisted up inside the fabric easily, but the fit and style is good enough for the price.",54849,3
54849,"They're great for a few wears, but don't think they'll last more than season, if that.",54849,3
54850,I bought this gray top in the size medium.,54850,3
54850,I loved the top and it arrived before the estimated delivery.,54850,3
54850,One flaw that I personally didn't like was that if you tie the laces then the shirt gets scrunched up a little.,54850,3
54850,And I got a medium but it felt a bit small.,54850,3
54850,The top does look lovely  nonetheless.,54850,3
54851,"Comfy, but I have a 36E bra size right now and usually wear a medium.",54851,3
54851,This was MUCH too small to contain my new boobs.,54851,3
54851,I need at least a size up.,54851,3
54851,It is a little snug all the way around even though my other medium clothes now fit fine.,54851,3
54851,I would order a size up if you want to wear postpartum.,54851,3
54852,the flap part is coming apart,54852,3
54853,I was hoping for the best when I purchased this and it is so small.,54853,3
54853,I wear a XL shirt and a size 14 pant.,54853,3
54853,It is SO tight in the arms that I am unable to wear it.,54853,3
54855,"I ordered a medium, but it looked more like youth size, I returned the item with no trouble.",54855,3
54856,"The shirt was really cool and I like it, but the sizes are WAY off.",54856,3
54856,"I usually wear a 2X, I ordered the 3X since it said it ran small, but it fit like an XL.",54856,3
54856,"Since I bought it to go tubing on the 4th, I cut up the seams and wore it over a tank top.",54856,3
54857,Its the best shirt and so cute it was a little smaller than his other 2T  But I love the shirt!,54857,3
54858,its flimsy but thats what i expected for the price,54858,3
54859,"Very long,long,long and tight on my stomach.",54859,3
54859,This dress is gorgeous and very nice to wear in the party.,54859,3
54859,But it is so long and need to be altered.,54859,3
54860,One of the strife was bigger the the rest!,54860,3
54861,It looks okay fits well too,54861,3
54862,The legs should have more elasticity with some softness this would have made it excellent .,54862,3
54862,I don't wear because of the uncomfortability,54862,3
54863,size ran very small,54863,3
54864,I originally bought these for better support wearing my casual shoes (Clarks/superstars).,54864,3
54864,"However, even with the soles taken out, they raise my feet way too high within the shoes!",54864,3
54864,It either constricts my feet or has my heels almost falling out the back of the shoes.,54864,3
54864,The saving grace was that they worked fine in my basketball shoes.,54864,3
54864,"However, I would think twice before getting these for your regular, casual shoes.",54864,3
54865,"Overall, I can't really complain.",54865,3
54865,"The cuffs are pretty and the price was great, but they are a bit flimsy.",54865,3
54865,I would recommend the product for someone who just wants it to wear with one outfit.,54865,3
54865,"However, for someone like me who wears them daily and sleeps in them, it isn't going to work.",54865,3
54866,"It is a nice wallet, not expensive but very practical, however, it is not mint green.",54866,3
54866,It is more blue.,54866,3
54867,This material and kind of small but its a decorative scarf for sure,54867,3
54868,Really cute laying on the bed!,54868,3
54868,However I have pretty loose jiggly boobs and tummy and the fabric didn't hold on to much of it.,54868,3
54868,The ties are made out of very stretchy fabric so it didn't hold the girls up much.,54868,3
54868,I stitched a modesty panel into the v which helped me not look so saggy.,54868,3
54869,"The area around the bust is quite tight,",54869,3
54870,I am giving these three stars because they are so different from the original Cheeks of which I had four pair!,54870,3
54870,The tan ones were a total NO GO and the purple ones I can wear easily but they are cut much narrower than the original Cheeks athletic sandal.,54870,3
54870,What a total shame.,54870,3
54870,Tony Little had a really good thing going with the original ones as they were just an excellent shoe.,54870,3
54870,These are just ill fitting flip flops!,54870,3
54870,Will not recommend and will not buy another pair!,54870,3
54871,"Too small and cheap, lasted 1 month.",54871,3
54872,"Cute shirt, the lace isn't sewn very well on the sides where it meets the shirt.",54872,3
54872,It's lifted and looks torn on both sides.,54872,3
54873,Although there are a few problems with it.,54873,3
54873,Its very cheaply made.,54873,3
54873,"It broke the first time I tried putting it on, but it isn't to hard to fix.",54873,3
54873,Took a bit of time but I think I got it to where I can wear it with out any problems.,54873,3
54873,Number two it's huge like its still loose on the last clasp.,54873,3
54873,If you are a small person think twice about it,54873,3
54874,Had to buy a bunch of these as a work promotion and there is a bit of contention as the 3x fits the same as a 2x.,54874,3
54874,"So the person who brought this shirt, has one that barely fits and the person with the 2x is swimming.",54874,3
54874,Also be aware that in the picture its a violet shirt with lilac flowers and blue/green leaves.,54874,3
54874,"But in person the flowers are almost bright pink, the shirt is more of a royal/eggplant purple making it too ""girly"" for most men.",54874,3
54875,It was ok a little to large,54875,3
54876,The material of these were ok and not really to thin.,54876,3
54876,"The band is very thin and made loose rather than a tighter elastic, and because of this these kept sliding down.",54876,3
54876,There's nothing I hate about leggings worse than to get a pair and have to go around tugging them up all the time.,54876,3
54877,A bit disappointed in the fit.,54877,3
54877,Snug at places and long.,54877,3
54877,"I am a petite so it did look like a dress on me, but I am still wearing it.",54877,3
54877,"If the arms weren't tight, I would be wearing it often.",54877,3
54878,I ordered a size larger than needed since other reviews mentioned shrinkage and it did shrink after washing to just fitting - a little snug so for growing room go up 2 sizes.,54878,3
54878,Also white with red alligators became pink with red alligators but was washed in warm water so grandson was not happy but did wear them.,54878,3
54878,Seemed soft and comfy but snug to me.,54878,3
54880,"When this item arrived, I realized very quickly that it was not quite what I was expecting.",54880,3
54880,The fit was also very small.,54880,3
54880,I contacted the seller for a refund.,54880,3
54882,"A little short for me at 5'8""",54882,3
54883,These are not over the calf.,54883,3
54883,They are comfortable in the foot but will not stay up on my calf.,54883,3
54883,Will donate them to a local charity.,54883,3
54885,"very cute...The whole thing would have fit fine but, the crotch seems to be a bit too small, making a slight camel toe.",54885,3
54885,"Probably would be fine on the outside, just a little too uncomfortable for me I'm 5'2 and 133lbs.",54885,3
54885,good length and loose everwhere else.,54885,3
54886,This dresses is so pretty and I wish it would fit me I was so up set when it didn't I wanted to wear it to church this Sunday :(.,54886,3
54887,"It is a very cute tankini, but it runs a bit large compared to the sizing chart.",54887,3
54887,"I typically wear a large, but the size chart indicated i should buy an XL.",54887,3
54887,I did and it was huge.,54887,3
54887,i returned and ordered a large.,54887,3
54887,"The bottoms fit true to size, the top just barely is ok, pulled all the way tight.",54887,3
54887,"It also has significant breast pads, which make you look molded and in place, which can be good or bad for you.",54887,3
54887,"The pads don't provide support, just a nice appearance of support.",54887,3
54887,"I don't think this one will last long, and with the looseness of the top, i am a bit concerned about getting wet.",54887,3
54887,"If you are top-heavy or broad chested, this may be a great suit for you (I am a 34DD, size 10 bottom).",54887,3
54887,"i would guess if i were a 36 DD or a 36F, this would be stellar for the price.",54887,3
54888,"It fits, but the band looks slimmer than on the model, so this is not a one-size fits all if your hips are wider than 37 inches, it won't fit right.",54888,3
54888,I just got lucky!,54888,3
54889,A little tight on my daughter's face but it didn't bother her.,54889,3
54889,The glasses brought her pink lady look together.,54889,3
54890,Cute but runs small,54890,3
54891,Ehh way too small for a large.,54891,3
54891,Ended up giving it to a friend.,54891,3
54893,"It's perfect and great looking, every kind of cards would be save using of this RFID Wallet.",54893,3
54893,I bought it 20 days ago and I like it.,54893,3
54894,Didn't fit both glasses like I thought it would.,54894,3
54895,The only reason why I'm giving this dress 3 stars in because it looks nothing like the picture and is completely see through at the top and on the bottom.,54895,3
54895,"However, the dress I received does have very cute colors (there are more purples and dark corals) and fits me perfect!",54895,3
54895,"I'm only 4'11"" so it's tough to find maxi dresses that don't drag on the ground and this one doesn't.",54895,3
54897,"Quality fabric; very soft, slight strech, not sheer at all.",54897,3
54897,Much better than I expected.,54897,3
54897,"If I were smaller chested, it would be perfect.",54897,3
54897,I am a 36C.,54897,3
54897,The straps that wrap around the top of the body are not thick enough for medium to larger chested women.,54897,3
54897,"The straps are long and allow for wrapping around several times, but due to the small width, I either expose sideboob or a ton of cleavage- or usually both!",54897,3
54897,I have tried several ways to wrap the chest but it never feels secure.,54897,3
54897,I have wrapped it exactly as shown online (YouTube) and none of the ways leave me covered enough to go out into public.,54897,3
54897,"Will have to take it back :(
Again, great quality.",54897,3
54897,If u are smaller chested- I would recommend it 100%.,54897,3
54898,Little larger than expected but did shrink when put in the dryer.,54898,3
54898,Background is a beige not grey as picture appears,54898,3
54899,They run a half size smaller than what she normally wears,54899,3
54900,Comfortable but could be better- not for small women who r fit,54900,3
54901,"This was part of a gift basket made with ""beer bucket"" the shorts were very skimpy and doubtful they n be worn, and that was size large.",54901,3
54901,"Glass was nice, so overall ok.",54901,3
54902,"Cute but large, these TOMS are unique and have been complimented often.",54902,3
54902,According to the size they should fit but are wide and therefore fit loose for my kid's size ordered.,54902,3
54902,My daughter still loves them and with an insole insert and wearing socks has made the fit a bit more snug.,54902,3
54902,Perhaps shoes come in wide size and I was sent such without selecting or knowing.,54902,3
54903,I like it it is like a expected,54903,3
54904,"Beautiful Top, but Not US sizing.",54904,3
54904,"Fits at least 2 sizes small, maybe 3.",54904,3
54904,Still a lovely top though.,54904,3
54906,Beautiful sweater but very small.,54906,3
54906,Order at least 1-2 sizes larger.,54906,3
54906,Will have to return mine.,54906,3
54907,"I wanted to love this dress so badly, but despite the bottom half of the dress fitting correctly, the top just seemed off.",54907,3
54907,I am a 34D and I usually wear a medium in most things.,54907,3
54907,I ordered a large in this and the top portion of the dress was way too loose.,54907,3
54908,"Kinda tight, I ordered extra large",54908,3
54909,Didn't receive item as soon as stated.,54909,3
54910,Wish they had more bright colors.,54910,3
54911,Cute but sizing is off.,54911,3
54912,"The charn is very small and the chain as well, bought it for myself but gave it to my granddaughter.",54912,3
54913,Fast shipment but kind of small for the boys they are a 2T and I ordered the largest size,54913,3
54914,"I love the color but the material is a little stiff, even after washing a couple times with fabric softener.",54914,3
54914,It's great to wear with leggings but I wish the pockets were lower.,54914,3
54914,Not comfortable to put hands in.,54914,3
54915,Weird fit with pants.,54915,3
54915,With a pencil skirt it is adorable.,54915,3
54915,Definitely needs to be tucked in.,54915,3
54916,It will be good once its stretched out,54916,3
54917,"Cute hat, but it's a small fit.",54917,3
54918,Sizing is a bit small,54918,3
54919,The id section does not come apart from wallet.,54919,3
54919,The picture is misleading.,54919,3
54919,"Other then that, it's a very good product",54919,3
54920,I like about five beads that look higher in quality.,54920,3
54920,Luckily I wasn't planning using all of them.,54920,3
54921,I own nearly a dozen Iron Fist shoes and love them all!,54921,3
54921,Some are more comfortable than others.,54921,3
54921,This pair are one of the least comfortable that I own.,54921,3
54921,They also make a weird squeaking noise with every step I take.,54921,3
54921,I probably won't get much use out of these.,54921,3
54921,I highly recommend the seller but not these shoes.,54921,3
54923,I ordered this bra in the size cup D and it was way too small.,54923,3
54923,"The ""D cup"" size would only work for women with an A or B cup.",54923,3
54923,"Also, the edges and material of the bra was rough.",54923,3
54924,It fits good but the back stings broke off and now I can't wear it,54924,3
54925,Very cute but the sequin stabs,54925,3
54926,Fit smaller then a Large should.,54926,3
54927,too hot to wear for extended time,54927,3
54928,disappointed in the quality of the leather.,54928,3
54929,Nice but the bracelet was too big,54929,3
54930,"Print was very cute and they are warm feeling, but the fit was just awkward.",54930,3
54930,High rise and baggy in the front because of the odd elastic waist.,54930,3
54930,I was expecting a normal legging fit which is fitted all the way through.,54930,3
54930,"They also were quite short, being that I'm 5'11"".",54930,3
54930,"I guess it all depends on what fit you're looking for, so I gave them to my older sister",54930,3
54931,not as expected in material,54931,3
54932,Nice curtain but the cost for quality didn't measure up.,54932,3
54932,The curtain looks like something you can find at a garage sale.,54932,3
54933,Very uncomfortable but it works somewhat,54933,3
54934,Cheaper material than it looks in the picture but okay otherwise.,54934,3
54935,"good material, way to large for me though",54935,3
54936,I am 5'1 and 180 lbs.,54936,3
54936,"I ordered this XL and the bottoms fit perfectly, however, the top piece is not wide enough to cover my boobs when I tie it.",54936,3
54936,"Additionally, I followed the instructions on the picture provided to tie the top part.",54936,3
54937,"I expected this to be a black ring with gold accents, however the one I received is gold with no black at all.",54937,3
54937,"It's cute, but it feels cheaper than I would like.",54937,3
54938,very narrow and bust is way too tight.,54938,3
54938,Love the color and the flow of the blouse,54938,3
54939,"Liked the style, but not long enough.",54939,3
54941,"A cheap, one time use costume.",54941,3
54942,Luv it.l although I haven't worn it yet.,54942,3
54942,Jersey type material but comfortable and fits just right.,54942,3
54943,"To the surprise of absolutely no one, this necklace (which cost me $1.68 plus a couple bucks shipping) is cheaply made.",54943,3
54943,"About half the stones had fallen off in the package, so it looked really tattered and pathetic when I first pulled it out.",54943,3
54943,"But the jump rings were all in there too, so after a few minutes and a pair of pliers I got everything back to normal.",54943,3
54943,Recommend for anyone like me with a passion for ridiculous costume jewelry.,54943,3
54944,I burn easily and bought this scarf to keep the sun off my arms and chest.,54944,3
54944,I'm a XL top.,54944,3
54944,"Good: this scarf is huge and I can easily wrap it over my shoulders and then across my chest, back over the first shoulder.",54944,3
54944,It covers all that I need covered.,54944,3
54944,"Also, it's really pretty and I get lots of complements (I have the blue one).",54944,3
54944,Not so good: this shawl gets quite warm if there is no wind or if your standing still.,54944,3
54944,"Also, it catches on everything and I now have a bunch of pulls on it.",54944,3
54944,I still use it but it's probably with around $10 not the $20 I paid for it.,54944,3
54945,Material was thinner than expected,54945,3
54946,Brim is a little floppy; my son doesn't like that.,54946,3
54947,"Too large for my 32C and 24"" waistline.",54947,3
54948,This swim suit was really cute and good quality when it came in which is nice except for the fact that it was TINY.,54948,3
54948,I am 5'3 and 100 pounds and I ordered a medium since the other reviews said buy a size bigger than you normally do.,54948,3
54948,The medium bottoms fit great but the top was very small.,54948,3
54948,Definitely designed for very flat chested people.,54948,3
54949,"I received an XL and while it did help that the Velcro closure at the waist as about 3-4 inches long, the skirt had just enough fabric to wrap around my 38-inch waist.",54949,3
54949,"Skirt is very short made with very soft fabric; great for bedroom play but NOT for a Halloween or costume party--unless it's one of ""those"" parties!",54949,3
54950,My daughter wears 8-8.5 in the Stride Rite shoes.,54950,3
54950,These size 8 were huge!,54950,3
54950,Way too large kept falling off her feet even dry.,54950,3
54950,But we will order a size down as in general these are pretty  nice.,54950,3
54951,"Very small, Chinese made piece if crap.",54951,3
54952,ehhh not worth writing a review for,54952,3
54953,its go with any kind of tops,54953,3
54954,"Past the metal (faux) buckle I would call this ""incomplete""
I am a 40-42 waist and had this thing set to the end of the straps to fit.",54954,3
54954,"The holster is too small to fit most of the replica blasters on the market (seems like the obvious use)
**Holster does not include the leg strap as featured in the films.",54954,3
54954,Glaring mistake- functionally deficient without it!,54954,3
54954,"**
Holster sticks out oddly without the strap.",54954,3
54954,"I cut a small slice and used a brown ribbon

Once you fix the issues this is the key piece to complete a Han Solo look.",54954,3
54955,Was smaller then expected.,54955,3
54955,Shrunk after the first wash.,54955,3
54955,However the print stayed in tact.,54955,3
54955,Just buy it too big.,54955,3
54956,"It was some what small, I wear a size 10 or medium .",54956,3
54956,I love the material silky and comfortable.,54956,3
54956,"I may give this to my niece, unless I lose a little wieght",54956,3
54957,Not made for bigger breasted women.,54957,3
54957,Fit over on top but the pads were oddly shaped making it feel weird.,54957,3
54957,Bottoms fit fine and comfortable,54957,3
54959,"Nice suite, bottom run small",54959,3
54960,The costume quality is not as good as expected.,54960,3
54960,I like the fit and cut of it but would have liked it to be better constructed.,54960,3
54961,It's an ok dress; just not what I expected from the picture.,54961,3
54961,"The color is definitely black and white, not with the hint of grey.",54961,3
54961,The fabric has a good cotton-polyester feel and is quite stretchy and feels soft against the skin.,54961,3
54961,I am a usual size 12 so I ordered a XL.,54961,3
54961,It fits well in the waist and hip areas; but the bust is a bit roomy.,54961,3
54961,"I'm 5'5"" and it hits about an inch below the knee.",54961,3
54961,An ok go-to dress for the office/church.,54961,3
54962,I thought a rain jacket should fit loosely because you need to wear it over other clothes.,54962,3
54963,"The top has two ""s"" clips on the black straps that are meant to close around the back rib cage (one on each side) instead of just one.",54963,3
54963,I've made due but it's definitely an error in manufacturing - just weird!,54963,3
54963,The bottoms are a little loose but that's ok with me.,54963,3
54963,It's an ok bathing suit but flawed.,54963,3
54964,Blazer is little too stiff.,54964,3
54964,Also shoulders stand up.,54964,3
54966,These fit as expected and I used the size chart it was accurate for me.,54966,3
54966,I'm not as fond of the material and they are somewhat shiny.,54966,3
54966,After I washed them they clung together.,54966,3
54966,"They are warm and perfect for wearing under dresses and tunic tops, not sheer so no fear of that!",54966,3
54967,"Its ok. Its not very stylish, but it keeps your head warm.",54967,3
54968,"Very cute shirt, a little tight the shirt runs a little small.",54968,3
54969,"Runs very, very small.",54969,3
54969,The 2X is approximately Size L.  I'm going to give it as a gift for Christmas.,54969,3
54970,"It's a nice piece but for middle aged figures, not enough structure.",54970,3
54971,Turtleneck was too small,54971,3
54972,I usually wear a 1x because I have big thighs and hip.,54972,3
54972,But this dress is tooooo stretchy I got a Large but I'm sure I would have been able to fit a M or even a S.,54972,3
54973,Plenty of room..More than plenty of room.,54973,3
54973,I would normally wear a 2X.,54973,3
54973,I should have listened to the other reviews and ordered a smaller size so that is a 'my bad' on my part.,54973,3
54973,I could have easily worn two sizes smaller.,54973,3
54973,"The material is not the plush look or feel  that I expected for the ""before"" on sale price.",54973,3
54973,"Not to mention that every single piece of lint and dog or cat hair from my house to the neighbors house a block away is attracted to it, also a 'my bad' on my part for getting the navy blue.",54973,3
54973,I use it outside for extra covering on my legs(like a blanket) in the cold..It is mildly warming for 40 to 50 degree weather in my humble opinion.,54973,3
54973,What can I say.,54973,3
54973,I wouldn't wear it in public.,54973,3
54973,It's just not as pretty as it looks on the model.,54973,3
54974,"Im 5'7"" and the length was about mid calves and the sleeves were not full length, more of a 3/4 sleeve.",54974,3
54974,Still loved it but it wasn't as long as I hoped,54974,3
54975,Size runs small but still love it....,54975,3
54976,"the packaging wrinkles and fold lines do not wash out.....washed and put in dryer twice....regardless of tag...wash cold gentle, dry low....no problem...but needs to be ironed.",54976,3
54977,Adorable but runs small!!!,54977,3
54977,I needed this for a vacation in July but was not able to wear.,54977,3
54977,The shipping is extremely slow so I was unable to return it for a different size.,54977,3
54977,Go up one size when ordering!,54977,3
54978,Pretty but not awesome quality,54978,3
54979,Lovely shirt but way to small and I ordered a size larger than normal!,54979,3
54980,Like the quality but so small,54980,3
54982,These are very cute slippers.,54982,3
54982,I have bought these early for a gift for my great niece.,54982,3
54982,They look to be too big though.,54982,3
54982,So I may have to try ordering a different size if they have them.,54982,3
54983,looked perfect with my wedding dress.,54983,3
54984,Fit a little small but still comfortable to wear.,54984,3
54984,Put my finger right through the black ones the first time I tried them on and I don't have long fingernails.,54984,3
54984,"Was careful from there on but shouldn't have to baby them, in my opinion.",54984,3
54984,Weren't too expensive so I guess you get what you pay for.,54984,3
54985,Love the tie clip but the bar won't stay on my collar.,54985,3
54985,One side always pops off.,54985,3
54985,Not sure if it's too short or has a defective clip but one side won't hang on to the collar at all.,54985,3
54987,"Love the suit, but the bottoms are way way too small.",54987,3
54988,kind of smaller then I thought,54988,3
54989,The dress is gorgeous but it was too small.,54989,3
54989,I would advise ordering one or two sizes up.,54989,3
54991,Good for the price,54991,3
54992,"Its okay, simple, quality fair, can't complain the price was good.",54992,3
54993,Not the fine quality I desire.,54993,3
54993,but lesser quality deserved for the low price.,54993,3
54995,Shirt is very cute and has a decent fit.,54995,3
54995,"My 2 year old is slightly smaller than a 2T, so I expected this to be a little big.",54995,3
54995,"However, it has more of a short/wide fit and the nick is pretty big.",54995,3
54995,It'll work for what it's needed for though!,54995,3
54996,Very nice but super small for a one size shirt.,54996,3
54996,Gave it to a friend.,54996,3
54998,Shoulders fit a little too small,54998,3
54999,I love this ring.,54999,3
54999,My husband bought it for me for our anniversary and he got the I know ring.,54999,3
54999,The only problem with it is the black color has rubbed off the I Love You on the ring.,54999,3
54999,You can still tell it says I LOVE YOU but it is no longer black.,54999,3
54999,"It rubbed off in about a month's time,  Otherwise it is a nice ring.",54999,3
55000,The quality was nice but much larger than the description and a bit too heavy for a bracelet.,55000,3
55001,Fits a little big and stiching on dog  started unraveling after first wash.,55001,3
55001,The colors and design are adorable though.,55001,3
55001,Contemplating getting a dress they make...hopefully quality on this one is just a fluke.,55001,3
55003,"Works great if your arms are real skinny, mine are not.",55003,3
55006,I like how strechy it is.,55006,3
55006,It also brings out my figure.,55006,3
55006,Shows off the booty and boobs.,55006,3
55006,I will say it's a thinner material then my normal catsuits.,55006,3
55006,I would recommend wearing black bra and panties underneath.,55006,3
55006,But it's great for the thick girls .,55006,3
55007,Product was too small,55007,3
55008,"I personally think this thing is too small, I need to carry about 3 more cards plus cash.",55008,3
55009,This ring was so beautiful and I really loved it.,55009,3
55009,However; after a few weeks the metal plating wore off and exposed what ever metal is under the gold plating.,55009,3
55009,The plating chipped of in large junks and the ring turned my finger a greenish black.,55009,3
55009,The other issue I had with the ring was the stones them selves.,55009,3
55009,"When the ring arrived two were already starting to fall out and they eventually did, right around the same time the gold plating started to break down.",55009,3
55010,"Material was good, I bdont know when I wash it if it will stretch out but we will see......",55010,3
55011,It's difficult to unscrew if you screw it on too tight.,55011,3
55012,This was a gift for my sister.,55012,3
55012,It was so small I gave it to my daughter.,55012,3
55012,Great design- but sizes were really off,55012,3
55013,"I ordered an XL and there was no way the bottoms were gonna fit over my butt, or the fact that my boobs were spilling from underneath and ontop of the bikini top.",55013,3
55013,The bikini is the same as the picture just a shame it's way too small.,55013,3
55014,Wasn't true to size,55014,3
55015,"First off, this is a top quality, very warm coat, good for cold temps and snowy weather.",55015,3
55015,"The problem is, the pic is misleading.",55015,3
55015,"When I saw it I thought I was getting a cute parka with a slim, tailored fit.",55015,3
55015,Not so: this guy is in all actuality a beast of a coat.,55015,3
55015,"The coat is rather thick and bulky, and the hood is freaking massive.",55015,3
55015,"You can't put it up without it falling down over your eyes, effectively blinding you.",55015,3
55015,"It's kind of cute, in it's own way, and it's extremely functional otherwise, but dainty it isn't.",55015,3
55016,Brim of hat very large while toddler cannot see out beneath it.,55016,3
55017,The top was a little small and bottom a little big.,55017,3
55018,"They do not let you know that this is the back side of the shirt, not the front...",55018,3
55018,"I like the design but, I wish this was the front of the shirt, not the back...
Had I'd have known this was not the front, I'd have had second thoughts about buying this shirt...",55018,3
55020,"A bit pricey for what it is but its very nice, only downside is it can pull woven ties.",55020,3
55021,"My daughter's favorite color and after 1 wear and no wash, the ends are fraying.",55021,3
55022,Beautifully made but ridiculously undersize!,55022,3
55023,"Less than two months old and the strap broke - epic fail
Otherwise good bag",55023,3
55024,"Back is really cute, but not really functional.",55024,3
55025,I love everything about it with the exception of the underlay.,55025,3
55025,It doesn't cover very modestly and you can't raise your arms at all without showing all.,55025,3
55025,Disappointed because I wanted it to wear with sandals and seems that I'm going to have to wear leggings :(,55025,3
55026,Live the way it looks just  runs small.,55026,3
55027,The color emerald green is not as it is on the picture.,55027,3
55027,"It's a lot ""greener"" so i returned it.",55027,3
55027,But the quality is nice.,55027,3
55028,the material is not as good as I expected it to be?,55028,3
55028,I wish it looks more like the picture.,55028,3
55028,but i do love the way it hugs my body,55028,3
55029,fits like a size larger than expected.,55029,3
55030,The grooves aren't deep enogh and the hairband pops out a lot.,55030,3
55031,My arm is a little too small for it.,55031,3
55032,Took a long time to get here.,55032,3
55032,Difficult if you want to return it.,55032,3
55033,These are Asian sizes.,55033,3
55033,"I normally wear an XL,  but I bought an  XXL to wear loose.",55033,3
55033,It is very tight.,55033,3
55033,"They stretch,  but if you want to wear loose as seen in the picture,  buy at least two sizes larger.",55033,3
55033,It is also slightly sheer.,55033,3
55033,But it is very soft and will be a great pajama shirt.,55033,3
55034,A little too small but very nice looking,55034,3
55035,A little smaller than I expected.,55035,3
55035,But a decent basic pleated maxi skirt.,55035,3
55036,Not yellow more like lemon lime.,55036,3
55039,"Large on top, small on bottom and very short waisted...the total opposite of me.",55039,3
55039,Cute style and fabric feels nice but the shorts are short and the top had to be taken in because the girls were peeking out the sides.,55039,3
55043,You get what you pay for with this watch.,55043,3
55044,"Nice top, material a little stiff.",55044,3
55045,It came extremely tangled but I haven't wore yet to see how it fades,55045,3
55046,Cheap material but good for a few wears.,55046,3
55047,The material is not what I expected.,55047,3
55048,I wanted to give this to my brother and what a surprised this is a shirt for women not for men so I ended giving it to my mom instead.,55048,3
55048,It looks like men on the picture but it is not a men's shirt.,55048,3
55048,Fabric is good and graphic design is great,55048,3
55049,It's tough to get the stone threaded into the loop.,55049,3
55049,I also had to order a replacement because the first ring would not stop spinning nor tighten.,55049,3
55050,"Broke too easy, only had for about 2 weeks before they broke beyond repair.",55050,3
55050,"First time, the lens popped out, and getting it back in wasn't so bad.",55050,3
55050,"The second time, they dropped off my hat (my bad), and both lenses popped out.",55050,3
55050,"The lenses are held in on the bottom with a fishing line type of material, and when trying to insert one of the lenses, the line broke which made the glasses unrepairable.",55050,3
55051,The designs are cute but the green color matching of the shirt and shorts just do not match!,55051,3
55051,The material is very comfy for my 4 yr old.,55051,3
55051,I know it doesn't make a difference to him about the colors but as a parent you want your child to dress in matching colors even if it is just to sleep.,55051,3
55054,"I always have a hair tie on my wrist, and it just ruins my bracelet game, so when I found out about these I was stoked.",55054,3
55054,"I bought this kind and the kind that has more of an indentation/groove ""cut"" into the bracelet itself.",55054,3
55054,I much prefer the cut-groove type.,55054,3
55054,Because this is just convex (the edges just bend up slightly to hold the hair elastic on the bracelet) the hair tie slides out very easily.,55054,3
55054,"I also felt the the cut bracelets were thicker/sturdier, and they were textured at the bottom of the groove which also helped the hair tie to not slip out.",55054,3
55054,"I far prefer that product, but the seller did have good customer service when I returned my order (previously, at my time of purchase, the title misleading said you got 2 bracelets.",55054,3
55054,"I'm not sure if I would have been able to return if the description weren't wrong)

(If you found my review helpful, please click ""Yes"" below.",55054,3
55056,"I'm 5'8"" and this gives me a wedgie.",55056,3
55056,Not for a long torso.,55056,3
55057,I first received this and it had a rip on the shoulder in the lace :( I had to sew it back together myself which was annoying.,55057,3
55057,But it fit well on my Preggo belly and looked awesome in my maternity photos.,55057,3
55057,I just contacted the seller and they refunded me about $3 for the rip.,55057,3
55057,I usually wear a medium but since I'm pregnant I ordered an XL and it fit well.,55057,3
55057,Very see through though so I had to order a slip to wear underneath it.,55057,3
55057,Not bad for the price :),55057,3
55059,shirt is not the color as shown in the picture.,55059,3
55059,NOT a pretty bright blue at all,55059,3
55060,"The quality is fabulous, BUT it's much more green then in the photo.",55060,3
55060,"I thought I was getting more of a mint color, but I received more of a grassy/Aqua darker green.",55060,3
55060,"And it would be too much to send back, so I'm just going to deal with it.",55060,3
55061,I had bought a XL and thought it was just a bit small.,55061,3
55061,It seemed like the top of the back kind of rolled down so I bought a bigger size.,55061,3
55061,The XL was too big but I decided to try the smaller size again...,55061,3
55063,I got what I paid for,55063,3
55064,"I know it isn't advertised as a gaming pad, It's really too small for true PC gaming.",55064,3
55064,"While I do think it would appeal to a gamer, there's just not enough surface area for comfort.",55064,3
55065,Too small and the fabric is not good!,55065,3
55066,Great took but don't go by the picture if you order an XL.,55066,3
55066,Its wide but short so it won't fit a tall person.,55066,3
55067,There was nothing wrong with the product.,55067,3
55067,It arrived as stated but it is much bigger than I thought it would be.,55067,3
55067,It's a good standby if my other one doesn't work.,55067,3
55068,Cute and perfect length only thing is they're kinda see through but I kindof expected that for white.. All in all not bad,55068,3
55069,Waited over a month for the necklace to ship but once it came it looked really cool.,55069,3
55070,"This is a thin dress , cool material fits above my knee.",55070,3
55070,i am 5ft 7inches,55070,3
55071,Not as long as the others I have had and they slip!,55071,3
55071,The others came all the way to my knee and never slipped.,55071,3
55071,"Have ad the old ones for years, but needed new ones because they finally were wearing thin on the bottom!",55071,3
55071,"I ordered a medium, I wear a 9.5 narrow shoe!",55071,3
55073,"Tight Medium and silkscreen is cheesy, iron-on type of appliqu&eacute; material.",55073,3
55073,Looks like it won't hold up to repeated washes HOWEVER the shirt quality is top notch.,55073,3
55074,"These leggings were nice to wear to a roller derby practice, however there is a flaw in the pattern.",55074,3
55074,"The way the pattern and the stitching works, the elbows of sailor moon meet together right in your crotch.",55074,3
55074,It looks like you have a big red bow covering your unmentionables.,55074,3
55075,This is a great body con dress if you're in shape.,55075,3
55075,"However, if you're like me and have a tummy pooch, then no.",55075,3
55075,This dress was too clingy and didn't have enough of an A line to suit my needs.,55075,3
55076,"The top is kind of odd, too big on the part that clips together making the rest of the swimsuit fit funny.",55076,3
55078,The lense is thick.,55078,3
55078,They look more like sun glasses than reading glasses.,55078,3
55079,It's really cute fits food except sleeves are super tight and I have thin arms !,55079,3
55080,But zipper does not like to work half the time.,55080,3
55080,Bigger than I expected.,55080,3
55081,Not as tight as I expected it to be.,55081,3
55081,At a 36 DD and  a usual 10/12 I thought the large would be ik...but I should have gone with medium.,55081,3
55082,It fits as expected and is really cute on.,55082,3
55082,And the color was spot on.,55082,3
55082,The only thing I don't really care for is the large black stitching on the sides and sleeves.,55082,3
55082,Also not my favorite fabric choice but all in all happy with it.,55082,3
55083,They are smaller then expexted,55083,3
55084,"Totally awesome picture, but the fabric is super floppy.",55084,3
55084,I'm keeping the foam insert that it was packages with in the case with my laptop so it's a little sturdier.,55084,3
55085,"You do get what you pay for, but it did work in a pinch!",55085,3
55087,I usually wear a small but I wanted these to be loose so I bought a medium and they were still too tight.,55087,3
55088,"Not good for travel, you'll need compression support that also includes your feet otherwise your feet will swell up when you're flying.",55088,3
55088,Otherwise a solid fit.,55088,3
55089,It is very sexy but a little small even for the large I selected.,55089,3
55089,I will have to add a small piece to the shoulders to get the length I need for it too fit perfect.,55089,3
55090,"The jacket is cute,  the sleeves are a bit large and long.",55090,3
55091,a bit too flexible but i still wear it daily!,55091,3
55092,"Material is OK, nothing to rave about.",55092,3
55092,Definitely runs small and stitching is not the best but its a knock off so that's expected.,55092,3
55092,The only saving grace is the style which I am in love with.,55092,3
55092,"I bought a Large and the bottom was still a bit tight but thats ok I can work with a cheeky bottom,  So now I have a Large top that needs some alterations made to it as well.",55092,3
55092,Wish I could buy separate sizes but.,55092,3
55092,w.e (btw  im 5'5 128 lbs and bought a large based on reviews.,55092,3
55093,I think I may have accidentally bought in kids size because I bought an xlrg and it's extremely small,55093,3
55094,It was bigger than the size.,55094,3
55094,I gave it to my sister who is 2 sizes bigger than me.,55094,3
55094,But good quality though.,55094,3
55095,The sizes are not really exact.,55095,3
55095,I usually by small for tops and medium for bottom.,55095,3
55095,"I ordered size ""M"" and it was too small.",55095,3
55095,"I exchanged it for size ""L"" and it was a little big.",55095,3
55095,I keep it for use at home only.,55095,3
55096,I bought two of these.,55096,3
55096,The white and the hot pink.,55096,3
55096,The white ones are okay.,55096,3
55096,The pink ones hurt between my toes.,55096,3
55097,"These fit me perfectly but they are a pretty sheer and very, very thin - cheap fabric.",55097,3
55097,I never really wear them in public because they look so cheap and I hate that you can see my skin.,55097,3
55097,Good for around the house,55097,3
55098,Fabric is a little cheap.,55098,3
55099,Arrived yesterday and slightly damaged on the facing of the pendant.,55099,3
55099,"Picture is decent but not really ""high resolution"".",55099,3
55099,Chain and overall pendant is sturdy.,55099,3
55100,its ok. it fit perfectly but it was too short.,55100,3
55100,but overall pretty cute.,55100,3
55100,(lether is cotton like),55100,3
55101,Item was as described.,55101,3
55102,"Purchased this shirt after buying the white one and was disappointed in the shirt, I ordered the same size in both the Black ran very large, and was a weird spandex material.",55102,3
55102,"I gave it to a friend that loved the white one and loved it, so it worked out as a great gift and fit her better as she is a bit larger busted than I am.",55102,3
55103,"Colors are a little different than pictured, but still is really cute!",55103,3
55103,It fits kind of goofy though.,55103,3
55103,I ordered a size up due to most customers saying it was a little small.,55103,3
55103,"It fits pretty well, but it's really short.",55103,3
55104,I honestly thought this dress was just okay.,55104,3
55104,I had been eyeing it in my shopping cart for several weeks before I finally decided to get the dress.,55104,3
55104,"In the picture, I thought the dress was going to be more of a chiffon, gauze type dress.",55104,3
55104,"It's actually that polyester, spandex, swimsuit type of material so it does have a slight sheen to it.",55104,3
55104,The fit of the dress was a little weird.,55104,3
55104,"I'm 5'5"" and normally wear a medium or size 8.",55104,3
55104,I ordered this dress in a medium.,55104,3
55104,I really couldn't get it to look like it was on the mannequin.,55104,3
55104,"It shows a beautiful bow at the top and when you tie the straps, it just doesn't look like this.",55104,3
55104,"The straps can be worn three ways, but I didn't like the look of the others.",55104,3
55104,"Also, I wish the dress was just an inch or so longer.",55104,3
55104,"Overall, the dress was okay.",55104,3
55104,The print was bright.,55104,3
55104,"More orange that it looked to me in the picture, but that could just be from my computer screen.",55104,3
55104,I think I'm going to return it.,55104,3
55105,"waiting to receive, pretty in picture",55105,3
55106,I ordered larger than the size chart and it was still to small.,55106,3
55107,These are very thin and see through!,55107,3
55108,I liked the leggings but they do run small.,55108,3
55108,I ordered XL and should have ordered a larger size.,55108,3
55108,They are stretched so tight over my legs that you can see the flesh tone of my skin.,55108,3
55109,very thing fabric - might be ok for summer.,55109,3
55109,"not in any way better than Carters, just more expensive.",55109,3
55110,"I like the style - bought it off season so haven't worn it yet, but it runs very small -- as I believe other's have reviewed as well.",55110,3
55111,"Hard to hook and unhook, but very pretty.",55111,3
55112,I do wish it was more form fitting.,55112,3
55112,"I got the XXL size and I'm only 190 lbs, so definitely take that into account",55112,3
55113,"I did not notice that the package says ""slightly imperfect"" in the lower R/H corner, but I do not see any major imperfections.",55113,3
55113,What I was disappointed with however is the lack of padding on the soles.,55113,3
55113,I have purchased Gildan low cut socks before and they were two toned and had padding and I thought I was purchasing the same.,55113,3
55114,First I want to say the fabric is soft and lovely but the fit is somewhat tight on the white shirt exactly like the pink one  I purchased and the pink fits perfectly.,55114,3
55114,I believe the white shirt was mis-labeled on the size.,55114,3
55114,I am exchanging the white to get the proper size but everything about the shirt is very nice.,55114,3
55114,I will buy additional if more colors and styles become available.,55114,3
55115,My 2 1/2 year old son just started wearing 4t.,55115,3
55115,"Most brands have some growing room in the 4t, but these were very snug on him.",55115,3
55115,They fit more like a 3t.,55115,3
55115,"I would recommend ordering 1 size up from whatever size your child is, and you should be good to go.",55115,3
55115,"Even if they are a little bit, they do have a drawstring that can cinch them in a little bit until your little guy grows fully into them.",55115,3
55115,"Other than that, we absolutely love them, and they are perfect in length for his tall slender little body.",55115,3
55116,The skirt fits good but the color is somewhat different in reality.,55116,3
55118,Decent workout leggings but they do roll down and it would be nice if they had more control for the tummy to keep u tight while u workout.,55118,3
55118,"After a workout, they are stretched out and not so cute lol but they work.",55118,3
55119,"This dress was really pretty, but very see through.",55119,3
55119,It fit true to size and the lace was beautiful.,55119,3
55119,Ended up returning it.,55119,3
55119,"It came with a small hole in it, which I would have just sewn, but my daughter wasn't happy with it.",55119,3
55120,He wears it for extra warmth on those colder nights and mornings.,55120,3
55121,they broke really fast but worked great and looked sexy as well.,55121,3
55122,I was fairly disappointed with this really.,55122,3
55122,"The first few days postpartum it was too small, and then it quickly became too big.",55122,3
55122,The Velcro area isn't very large so there isn't a lot of flexibility in size.,55122,3
55122,I ended up using something else.,55122,3
55123,It ran a little big up top but overall it was ok with a little adjustments it was still worn and was nice.,55123,3
55124,My wife is loving this bathing outfit the product was well package looket great the fabrics are nice I am fully in acceptance with it,55124,3
55125,"Came with 3, not 5.",55125,3
55125,"Fits over ring, but not air tight.",55125,3
55125,I even ordered a smaller size with hopes it would fit tighter.,55125,3
55125,Overall a waste of money.,55125,3
55125,I give 3 stars because it could help protect softer stones like rubies or emeralds.,55125,3
55125,Useless to keep dirt out of my diamond engagement ring which was the reason I ordered in the first place.,55125,3
55125,Very tight by knuckle and loose near palm.,55125,3
55126,The fleece lining on the bottom comes up and bunches under my sons foot every time he wears them.,55126,3
55126,Not every comfortable I would assume.,55126,3
55127,Cute but cheaply made,55127,3
55128,I bought this necklace to go with a dress i had ordered and it was beautiful.,55128,3
55130,Don't know if it's real leather.,55130,3
55130,Feels and looks cheap.,55130,3
55130,The only reason I kept it is it can be a clutch without the need to transfer all my stuff and has lots of space.,55130,3
55130,ID pocket is NOT see through.,55130,3
55130,I assume my Galaxy would fit inside.,55130,3
55132,Good price but the aren't fitted well enough around the ankle.,55132,3
55133,"All the reviews said it would run small, so I got a bigger size, but that is a little tight too.",55133,3
55133,You need to go at least 3 sizes bigger than you normally would.,55133,3
55134,"Fits great, but cheap material.",55134,3
55134,After a few times of wearing it the top is coming apart,55134,3
55135,I expected it to be small.,55135,3
55135,The XXL fits like a medium.,55135,3
55135,"I'm 5'1"" 180 lbs.",55135,3
55135,Cheap thin material but I wasn't hoping for much.,55135,3
55135,Gonna convert it into a little slouch bag.,55135,3
55136,It's a bit bigger than other chokers,55136,3
55137,I liked the style but wearing an size 18 I ordered the xxl and still could not button...sigh...passed them to my daughter and picked up a pair locally,55137,3
55138,"The top is lovely, fits perfectly and looks very good.",55138,3
55138,"The reason for 3 stars is the color that I received is way too dull from the pic on the website and that's why I am returning it, but I will buy it in a different color.",55138,3
55139,This shirt is a bit short.,55139,3
55139,It doesn't even cover my midriff properly.,55139,3
55139,The color is stunning.,55139,3
55139,But it's not quite what I was hoping for.,55139,3
55140,The front does not close/cover much of the front of the body.,55140,3
55140,"Other than that it fits well (back, sleeves, length.",55140,3
55143,"Look great but be prepared, screws come out rather easy.",55143,3
55143,Make sure you buy a glasses repair kit with it.,55143,3
55144,"Super cute, but it flares out at the hips quite a bit.",55144,3
55144,"Also, the screen printing is kind of cheap and thick feeling.",55144,3
55144,It's a cute green though!,55144,3
55144,"I'm just running in it, so these things don't really bother me too much, just thought I'd pass them along..",55144,3
55145,I ordered this belt based on the picture that perfectly matches my shoes.,55145,3
55145,When it came in though it didn't remotely match the shoes or the picture.,55145,3
55145,"The actual belt was extremely orange, and not really brown or tan at all like the image makes you assume.",55145,3
55145,"The quality of the product, outside if the color, is very high.",55145,3
55146,It look nice o n my granddaughter  and fit her nice,55146,3
55147,"Kids kinda liked them, But they are a little cheaply made.",55147,3
55148,Much thinner material than I expected.,55148,3
55148,Does not seem like it will last long.,55148,3
55148,Also a little smaller than other shirts of same sizing.,55148,3
55149,you get what you paid for.,55149,3
55149,nothing extravagant but you can definitely dress it up and down.,55149,3
55150,Cute shoe but the AA heel was too big.,55150,3
55150,I had to return them.,55150,3
55151,I bought this knowing it wasn't going to fit.,55151,3
55151,But it was cheap enough that I could cut on it for Halloween and not have to feel bad.,55151,3
55152,The shirt didn't look like the picture.,55152,3
55153,The product wasn't for my piercing as described.,55153,3
55155,Love the color and uniques design.,55155,3
55155,"I usually wear a med, I'm 5'3"" 140lbs and it fit fine.",55155,3
55155,I had to sew the front together because it was so off center with the middle stitching it was making one off breast very visable..,55155,3
55155,I included a picture with a hanger for reference on how much it was off.,55155,3
55155,Also it could use a hemming on the shoulders since it kept wanting to slide off.,55155,3
55155,Over all excited to wear the dress.,55155,3
55156,Very cute but quite large,55156,3
55157,"At the price being charged for a tin ring, they could of at least put in a nice ring box and not a tin case that looks and feels like an unpainted Altoids mint  tin.",55157,3
55159,It's very pretty and looks just like the picture but runs very small in the arms and in the chest area,55159,3
55160,The prints and colors are great but I found the fabric to be quite thin .,55160,3
55160,"I ordered four pair and two of them had seams that were not fully stitched, I sent one back and repaired the other .",55160,3
55160,"These are an inexpensive option, just understand the reason for this, for the price I guess they are okay, I for one would rather pay another $10 for a higher quality product.",55160,3
55161,"Looks nice, but pricey for the quality.",55161,3
55162,Looks a little cheap and very short chain.,55162,3
55163,"Overall, It fits as expected.",55163,3
55163,"I could have easily  gone down a size-- however, wasn't sure of sizing so ordered the large.i normally wear a size 8-10.",55163,3
55163,It is comfortable to wear with the exception of the zipper.,55163,3
55163,The zipper can sometimes pinch at the top when zipped as it has the tendency to gradually slide down a few tracks on the zipper line.,55163,3
55163,"Also, I notice the zipper sometimes gets stuck and off track....very frustrating.",55163,3
55163,I'm asking for an exchange from the seller to assure I didn't receive a defective one.,55163,3
55163,The zipper isn't the best quality therefore I am only giving this product a 3 star because of the zipper for now.,55163,3
55163,Company contacted me after last post and refunded my previous garment and sent me a new one!,55163,3
55163,I am very pleased.,55163,3
55163,New garment is perfect!,55163,3
55163,Just contacted by Amazon company is recharging me for this product after telling me to keep the item.,55163,3
55163,Something slim shady is going on here!!,55163,3
55165,"I got the opalite; it itself is pretty, but has very small bumps/craters (not really noticeable unless you look/feel), adding to that ""definitely glass"" feel; and the casing is uneven, making the fact that it's plastic all too apparent, and it's kind of annoying.",55165,3
55165,the chain is actually really nice; probably higher quality than the rest of the necklace.,55165,3
55165,"anyway, to be fair: from a distance, none of the issues probably matter.",55165,3
55166,Good product just size slightly off for me they were a bit smaller than I hoped for,55166,3
55167,can not wear with low cut blouses,55167,3
55168,material is poor and the size is rediciously small.,55168,3
55168,seller was wonderful because they gave a full refund,55168,3
55169,I love the set itself.,55169,3
55169,The colors and the feel to it are perfect but when it arrived it came with the bottom part ripped and falling apart.,55169,3
55169,I am sending it back in hopes of getting another one in better condition but I do really LOVE how it looks on me.,55169,3
55170,"Functional, soft, warm but minimal fashion.",55170,3
55171,I love the wings.,55171,3
55171,The colour size and material were just as I thought they'd be.,55171,3
55171,But the finger loops.,55171,3
55171,One is the right size for a child's finger.,55171,3
55171,The other simply isn't there.,55171,3
55171,"I now I can fix this problem, But I really shouldn't have to.",55171,3
55172,"Too small, otherwise quality and color was good.",55172,3
55173,"I guess for price and delivery time it wasn't a bad deal, but when I received my order, several of the bindis either had loose rhinestones which fell out or the bindi was stuck and ripped when trying to remove from the plastic.",55173,3
55173,for those which were in tact they were very pretty and still stick on and did not come off until I was ready to remove.,55173,3
55174,Fits much smaller than other dresses I've bought from the same seller.,55174,3
55174,It's very pretty though.,55174,3
55174,I would suggest buying a size up.,55174,3
55175,"A nice training bra for girls, but BEWARE, if it does not fit or if you want to return it, you'll have to ship it back to CHINA and that will cost MORE than the bras themselves.",55175,3
55175,Only buy if you're sure of the size!,55175,3
55176,The fit is great but the slit up the back is a little much.,55176,3
55177,I liked this product when I got it but it doesn't come with a replacement needle.,55177,3
55177,Very cheap so I gues if you bend the needle not to much money to replace,55177,3
55178,It's just for around the house when you need something not too tight or expensive.,55178,3
55178,"You know, for days you scrub floors or go for Thai massage.",55178,3
55178,Not high quality and can gape at front because they shorted the material at the button holes.,55178,3
55179,It broke with in 2 days,55179,3
55180,"This is such a cute shirt, but it might as well have come from China.",55180,3
55180,I'm a big girl and ordered a 5x.,55180,3
55180,I would rather it be too big than too small.,55180,3
55180,"For reference for big girls out there, I normally wear a size 4x (30-32) from Woman Within.",55180,3
55180,I couldn't even put it on.,55180,3
55180,"The material is soft and its cute, but no way its a 5x.",55180,3
55180,"I decided to give it a 3 star because its cute, but if you are looking for true to size, this is not for you.",55180,3
55181,Was expecting better quality for the price,55181,3
55182,I really wanted to live this bag and couldn't wait to get it.,55182,3
55182,"When it arrived, I was rather underwhelmed.",55182,3
55182,"It's just a messangwr bag with stroller straps, a checklist (which is actually quite insulting as it implies that men have no idea what they are doing when it comes to babies), and a changing pad.",55182,3
55182,The front three pockets are rather small so you can't fit much into them but the main pocket is pretty decent sized.,55182,3
55182,I think that the bag is fine all in all but there's nothing super special about to warrant the price.,55182,3
55182,I may return this and re-order the DadGear back pack.,55182,3
55183,"Bits broke off as soon as I opened it, but I was still able to wear it.",55183,3
55183,It also is just as shiny as the picture.,55183,3
55184,It was very classy.,55184,3
55184,But the size didn't match up with the size given in US size .,55184,3
55184,It was way too small.,55184,3
55185,"Top is a nice material, but it is thin.",55185,3
55185,"But the size is very small, I have large breast and even ordering an extra large, it was still too tight and short.",55185,3
55186,I really like this swimsuit.,55186,3
55186,As a more mature woman it covers enough but still allows you some freedom as a bikini.,55186,3
55186,"The bottoms are a bit see thu-ish so I didn't get in the water, but as beach combing I felt comfy in it.",55186,3
55186,"I did buy a size larger than I wear due to others comments but still found the suit to be a bit on the small size, circumference wise.",55186,3
55187,Difficult to detemine size and they are way to big,55187,3
55188,GOT IT IN SEPTMBER HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE ALREADY TEARING,55188,3
55189,fabric quality is not good.,55189,3
55190,These Ray-Bans do not seem authentic.,55190,3
55190,"They look like a cheap pair, knockoff Ray-Bans.",55190,3
55190,Also there is no slight bend to them like my Ray-Bans.,55190,3
55190,The orange bag that they came in and how it had plastic packaging on the ear pieces.,55190,3
55190,I don't know this for certain but the feel of them make me think this.,55190,3
55190,This is why I am giving it a 3 star.,55190,3
55190,Will my 5 year old like them?,55190,3
55190,I am sure he will.,55190,3
55190,They are the blue lenses and fit him great.,55190,3
55192,I like the charm and the beads are nice.,55192,3
55192,But it was smaller than I'd hoped.,55192,3
55192,"I don't have large wrists and usually don't have a problem with bracelets, but this was tight.",55192,3
55192,Gave it to my wife and she likes it.,55192,3
55193,"Beautiful dress, but just too large.",55193,3
55193,We tried a size down but had to send it back as well.,55193,3
55193,It just didn't fit my tall thin daughter.,55193,3
55194,It was somewhat cheaply made.,55194,3
55194,Expected same quality as found in Scotland,55194,3
55195,It's cute but the snap button was poorly sewn on and came unraveled so I had to mend it.,55195,3
55195,Other than that it's great.,55195,3
55195,The straps are adjustable and it looks great over bandeaus.,55195,3
55197,You can see the outline of the bra padding especially in white.,55197,3
55197,It's ok if you were it under something.,55197,3
55198,Washed it once and 2 seams needed to be resewn!,55198,3
55199,For two pairs for the price a bit pricey ; don't stay on my 3 1/2 month baby's hands and the material of the printed area is not soft for baby w/ eczema,55199,3
55200,"Looks better on d model
Dress is a little cheaper looking",55200,3
55201,"These pants were cheap so I anticipated getting what I paid for The wording was placed more on the side of the leg than on the front which wasn't a problem but the first time I put them on, they ripped in two different places.",55201,3
55201,"Again, I anticipated this.",55201,3
55201,I sewed the holes up and wore them out and they were cute.,55201,3
55201,"These are SHEER pants, you really need to wear a shirt that covers your butt and front, in less you have no problem with them being visible because even stretching it out with your hands, you can see through the material.",55201,3
55201,I got about two washes out of them before the wording started to crack a little.,55201,3
55201,"They are comfortable but if you are wanting them to work out or last you a long time, save your money.",55201,3
55202,Not sure I even got what I thought I was ordering.,55202,3
55202,But I've worked it in here and there.,55202,3
55202,Sleeves are a little too long.,55202,3
55204,"The pants fit nicely, but the top was a bit tight.",55204,3
55204,I purchased a 2T and my daughter is between 24 mos and 2T sizing.,55204,3
55204,Fits closer to 24mos.,55204,3
55205,"I love the way this fits and feels, its super comfy and looks how it is pictured.",55205,3
55205,"Id rate it higher except it came in with a big hole in the side of the skirt, now I have to go through the trouble of 1.",55205,3
55205,Returning and waiting again for a new one or 2.,55205,3
55205,Taking time out of my day to sew something that should have came in tact :/,55205,3
55206,"I love the thickness and the feel of this choker, but the downside is that it's too big!!",55206,3
55206,I put it on at the tightest and it still slides down my neck.,55206,3
55207,ordered med shirt fit and looked like x small.,55207,3
55208,For the price I was kind of satisfied.,55208,3
55208,The crystal was glued in crooked but you can't notice from a distance.,55208,3
55208,"Overall, it's super cute but of poor craftsmanship.",55208,3
55209,"It's a beautiful bag, but way too small for me.",55209,3
55209,It really is extra small.,55209,3
55209,I have a note 5 phone and it barely fit in there with a phone case on it so I'm returning it.,55209,3
55209,":( If it were bigger, it'd be my dream purse.",55209,3
55210,Cute but the large fits like a small.,55210,3
55211,Dress is pretty but the colors somewhat vary from one in picture.,55211,3
55212,"I wore this for Christmas at my inlaws, very comfortable, nice fabric fits like an off the shoulder shirt.",55212,3
55213,I would get 1 maybe even 2 sizes up.,55213,3
55213,Almost a little too tight.,55213,3
55214,Not what I expected..,55214,3
55215,Size runs small so order a size bigger than what you normally wear...,55215,3
55216,"It was disappointingly small as I expected it to be bigger than it is, but it is a nice piece.",55216,3
55217,The skirt is not as described.,55217,3
55217,"It does have an elastic waist but is not ""pull on"" as described.",55217,3
55217,There is a zipper and the waist was quite small.,55217,3
55217,I had to return the item - at my cost.,55217,3
55217,Skirt is nicely made but not as described.,55217,3
55218,The edges we're not well hemmed and fraying.,55218,3
55219,The shirt is well made but the alien patch is very low quality.,55219,3
55219,Probably couldve put it on myself better.,55219,3
55220,A little smaller than expected.,55220,3
55220,Fits well just the length is way shorter than I would have liked.,55220,3
55221,The last shirt I received was smaller but the same size.,55221,3
55221,Disappointed in the length.,55221,3
55222,"It was to small, but I got a refund, so I am happy with the customer service.",55222,3
55223,This fits true to size.,55223,3
55223,The color was nice.,55223,3
55223,I didn't like how thin it was.,55223,3
55223,If the color was any lighter it would have been see through.,55223,3
55224,Beautiful top...but too small.,55224,3
55224,I usually wear a misses (not Junior) medium and I bought a Large and it is too snug in the bust area..,55224,3
55225,It is nice fabric with pretty colors and pattern.,55225,3
55225,However the nightgown is quite snug.,55225,3
55225,If I was to order a larger size then he robe would be way to big as that fits just fine,55225,3
55226,But what do you want for forty-nine cents ?,55226,3
55226,Is a cute gimmick/toy/party favor/subtle hint/motivator.,55226,3
55227,I needed a smaller size plus the hooks on this is a problem.,55227,3
55228,This item is okay if you plan to  wear and undercap that goes down pretty low on your forhead.,55228,3
55228,The  strip above the eyes is way to thin so your forhead  becomes  exposed quite a bot if your not careful,55228,3
55229,I would give these 5 stars but the zipper doesn't stay up.,55229,3
55229,After a couple minutes of wearing them it is all the way down.,55229,3
55229,I love the fit and color but the zipper is kind of a big deal.,55229,3
55230,"Coat runs small, I ordered a size up and it fits fine.",55230,3
55230,The sleeves may be true to size.,55230,3
55230,Not sure how warm this coat will be being it is now summer.,55230,3
55230,"But for the price, can't go wrong.",55230,3
55231,It don't fit has well I like but it will do the job.,55231,3
55232,"The first thing I noticed was that it came earlier than expected, which was awesome!",55232,3
55232,My hopes were let down once I opened the package to see taupe and not gray.,55232,3
55232,"The cardigan is thin, which doesn't bother me, as I live in the south.",55232,3
55232,The coloring of the patterns on the sleeves is cool.,55232,3
55232,The sizing is a little small as well seeing as I ordered a medium because I like my cardigans to be kinda of big and I usually wear and can and the cardigan itself was small in size.,55232,3
55232,I still kept it though and wear it once in awhile.,55232,3
55232,I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it.,55232,3
55233,Not wide leg as shown in picture.,55233,3
55234,Very good quality but runs small so I'm returning it,55234,3
55235,"Fit is perfect however, after the first wash, the elastic got all twisted up within the waistband.",55235,3
55235,I haven't been able to straighten it out yet!,55235,3
55236,Casual cover up but color much lighter than the photo,55236,3
55239,Scratches very very easily.,55239,3
55239,Will hurt the ridge of the nose or around the ears if worn for a long period.,55239,3
55239,Definitely wish that these were more comfortable.,55239,3
55240,Too small for the stated size.,55240,3
55240,Buy at least one size larger and two if you ever want to wear something bulky like a sweat shirt underneath.,55240,3
55241,Good material I love it!,55241,3
55242,I bought the gold tone weeks ago and loved it immediately.,55242,3
55242,I guess I am compararing this one with the gold tone; also antique in nature but very well done not brassy.,55242,3
55242,"The silver also antique in nature, seemed a little to dull at first appearance.",55242,3
55242,But it is growing on me and you have to mind what you wear it against.,55242,3
55244,i read many reviews of this wallet... i'm mostly happy with it.,55244,3
55244,the smell is awful ~ i put dryer sheets in all the compartments for a few days and left it open to air out.,55244,3
55244,the smell is dissipating but isn't gone.,55244,3
55244,"the leather is soft, the snap is strong.",55244,3
55244,the credit card pockets are easily accessed.,55244,3
55244,the change pocket zipper is very tiny and was separated when it arrived ~ i was able to  get it back together but i don't trust putting change in it in case it separates again and change goes flying.,55244,3
55244,the lining sounds crinkly ~ i assume it has something to do with the rfid.,55244,3
55244,i'm glad it was on sale ~ i would not be happy paying full price for this wallet.,55244,3
55245,Not what i expected but it is good quality and they came on time,55245,3
55246,"After only two wears, the buttons have fallen off.",55246,3
55247,The color of the shirt is more light than on the picture.,55247,3
55247,I was hoping for a more pink tint as on the picture.,55247,3
55247,"The fit looks funny on the stomach, it's a bit too loose.",55247,3
55248,fine for the gym.,55248,3
55248,"A bit flimsy, but very soft",55248,3
55249,Couldn't get the wax to adhere.,55249,3
55249,Did not come with instructions,55249,3
55250,"Much larger and longer than the picture looks, if you are small, a size small will swallow you.",55250,3
55250,"It's cute, just way too big.",55250,3
55251,"Just right for mild compression
Fit is fine",55251,3
55252,My kid wore these about three months and the glue around the edging is already peeling off the canvas like material.,55252,3
55252,Especially where you would normally bend your foot where the toes are.,55252,3
55253,My main concern is the bottoms fit a little smaller than I expected.,55253,3
55253,My son was  shocked  that my butt cheeks show.,55253,3
55253,I will wear it.,55253,3
55255,The design can make even an average sized-woman look bigger.,55255,3
55255,better get a plain design without those lines on the sides of the pants,55255,3
55256,"After trying it on, I realized it wasn't my style, I don't like that the back over layer has a cut all the way up it.",55256,3
55258,Not even seamed or serged at the raw edges.,55258,3
55259,it wasn't bottle of blood it was some cheaper brand but it worked ok,55259,3
55260,I looks a lot bigger in the picture than it does in person but for the money it is quite nice!,55260,3
55261,Couldn't even get it over my shoulders.,55261,3
55261,Rash guard looks really awesome and great material but the XXL is maybe closers to between a large and xl.,55261,3
55262,Had to return because these sleeves were way too snug.,55262,3
55262,"The dress itself fit (not counting the sleeves) as expected, was comfortable and very cute.",55262,3
55262,"The sleeves were very uncomfortable though, much too tight, for me it's not worth it to keep the dress with this issue.",55262,3
55263,Ok but not full like picture,55263,3
55264,"This is listed as XXL, but it is cut like a large.",55264,3
55264,Seems like high quality though.,55264,3
55265,"The cut is somewhat small, and the stitching pattern was off.",55265,3
55266,The body fits great.,55266,3
55266,The opening at the top of the arms near the shoulders is a little small.,55266,3
55266,Women that have thicker arms in that area may not find it comfortable.,55266,3
55266,The seam at that part is not elastic so it won't stretch to fit large arms.,55266,3
55267,"These work, as long as you have a way to keep them up.",55267,3
55267,I had to pin them to my bra straps to stay up under my shirt.,55267,3
55267,They are just too loose/big to stay put on their own.,55267,3
55269,Not as cute as it looks.,55269,3
55270,"I'm incredibly disappointed that this turned out to be much, much smaller than expected.",55270,3
55270,"I ordered a XXL hoping it would at least fit as a M, and it pains me to say it did not.",55270,3
55270,"Though, it is still a beautiful coat!",55270,3
55270,"I did give it to a friend for her birthday, and she's fairly small- so, it all worked out.",55270,3
55272,"Love the materiel,  plus it was thigh length as pictured.",55272,3
55272,Not very form fitting so big bonus.,55272,3
55273,THE COLOR FADED VERY QUICKLY,55273,3
55274,Top XXL Bottom size 12 otherwise beautiful,55274,3
55275,Not to impressed with it.,55275,3
55276,This is a nice knit cap but it is huge.,55276,3
55278,Beautiful dress but the cut out for the arm too big which compromises the overall fit.,55278,3
55279,"I looked at the size chart a bought the size accordingly but could not get over my hips so either wrong size in package,  which I did not check,  or I messed up somewhere or the person who stitched it did?",55279,3
55280,It is soo cute except it is see-through.,55280,3
55280,Like really see-through so thank goodness its only for pajamas.,55280,3
55281,It's very pretty but alil tight but it's ok I will still wear it,55281,3
55282,I didn't realize that the first time they were to be washed that they ran.,55282,3
55282,I now have regular clothes that are pink.,55282,3
55283,This is a good insole but I thought it was like the one I purchased from podiatrist.,55283,3
55283,Evidently there is a different one for consumer as opposed to medical.,55283,3
55283,"The one I got from dr., although it was power step, was far superior to this one.",55283,3
55283,"Not sure how to get one short of paying for dr visit, in the meantime, this one is adequate",55283,3
55284,Looks great and feels substantial since it has some weight to it.,55284,3
55284,But it feels a bit bulky and pushes into the surrounding fingers so it's uncomfortable and we'll be looking for another ring after all.,55284,3
55284,For ~$20 it was worth a try and a nice back up ring.,55284,3
55286,It could have been one size bigger to fit perfectly.,55286,3
55286,It was tight fit and it kept rising but I loved the style.,55286,3
55286,It was more of a pinkish nude color and not gold.,55286,3
55287,"The latch had to be adjusted on one of them, but after that ok!",55287,3
55288,"For a tall person this is shirt is short, and I don't like showing off my tummy.",55288,3
55289,I order a sliver and I receive a gold..,55289,3
55289,It's very cute but I'm so upset because now I have to go fine a sliver because  the gold doesn't go with my outfit and my iPhone 6s couldn't fit ..,55289,3
55290,Seem is coming undone,55290,3
55291,This is definitely a light weight jacket.,55291,3
55291,I am not sure how sturdy it is.,55291,3
55291,The XL fit perfectly and I am glad people indicated that the jacket ran a bit small.,55291,3
55292,I am a curvy person with a small waist and wide hips and I thought this would be great to wear under my wedding dress but it rolls down causing the top to bulge and just made me feel uncomfortable...,55292,3
55293,This was a purchase for my wife.,55293,3
55293,We were attending an all white party and she needed something asap.,55293,3
55293,"This dress is not horrible, (if you know how to accessorize) but it's not great either..it's just ok. For the price we paid, I guess ok can do.",55293,3
55293,Make sure you have the proper undergarments because the material is thin and also make sure you order two sizes above your regular dress size.,55293,3
55295,The bag itself looks very nice on the outside.,55295,3
55295,"I was not expecting the zipper to open up as far as it does, then again there were no pictures of the side.",55295,3
55295,I took off a star for that and also the fact that the inside of the bag is cheap looking.,55295,3
55295,There was no picture for the inside either and now I know why.,55295,3
55295,The inner material is plasticity but seems easy to clean.,55295,3
55295,I've had it about 3 weeks now and the front top pocket zipper pull has come out on me twice.,55295,3
55295,Also the inner pocket zipper is coming out at the seams.,55295,3
55295,The zipper pull has come out and will not go back for that pocket so I will have to replace it and this time do it right.,55295,3
55295,It isn't a bad bag besides that but bare in mind the zippers are not well done.,55295,3
55295,That zippers are the reason for the second star removed.,55295,3
55295,Overall not too bad for the price but be more careful the me.,55295,3
55296,Size large is more like a medium.,55296,3
55297,I did not expect the puffed sleeve,55297,3
55298,Love it the top is too small so I ended up buying another one in a large to see how the top will fit I usually ware a small and medium I ended up buying a small which was a bad idea lol the skirt fits perfect just not the top I suggest ordering a large no matter what size you are definitely for small women,55298,3
55299,They were smaller then others I've bought in the  past,55299,3
55300,Could have been curved a little tighter.,55300,3
55300,"Holds a stack of cash great, but a few bills not so well.",55300,3
55301,I love the style and the color but it was way too small and I ordered two sizes larger than I usually wear,55301,3
55302,Arrived right at end of time frame for shipping.,55302,3
55302,Rec to go up a size (I usually wear a M but I purchased a L for it to hang just so...)- BUUUTT even still the fit does seem a bit off but I will keep it because overall it still is cute enough for the price...,55302,3
55303,I wanted it to fit me a bit loose but it still fts pretty good.,55303,3
55303,Perfect I'm 5'2 140 pounds and I bought a large,55303,3
55304,I am 4'9 and 117pounds.,55304,3
55304,I got one size up than what i normally wear because of the reviews and yet it stills fit a tab bit big.,55304,3
55304,"However, I still like to wear it every so offend",55304,3
55305,It was way to small.,55305,3
55305,My suggestion is to  get a size bigger it's a pretty dress jus couldn't fit it.,55305,3
55306,The stones are set so high from the post.,55306,3
55306,I don't like how big they look.,55306,3
55307,This dress was much smaller than expected.,55307,3
55307,I got an XL to achieve the loose drapey look (normally M-L).,55307,3
55307,"It is incredibly tight in the chest and shoulders with a neckline much higher than pictured, but the rest is nice and flowing, mid-thigh length.",55307,3
55307,"It's OK, but has more of a stiff formal look than a casual tunic/dress.",55307,3
55307,Definitely order a size or 2 up.,55307,3
55308,"super cute pattern/colors, probably should've gotten a medium bc the top is a little small.",55308,3
55308,Also the top and bottoms are reversible.,55308,3
55308,"But beware, the bottoms are very small!",55308,3
55309,I really like how this case looks.,55309,3
55309,"My direct sales company is all about Black, Green and BLING, which is the MAIN reason that I purchased this case for my new Galaxy Note 5.",55309,3
55309,"However, after using it for only a day, some of the rhinestones started popping off and it just doesn't fit in the top left corner like it should.",55309,3
55309,"Like, my phone doesn't go down in the case all of the way.",55309,3
55309,"I do like that it makes my phone feel not quite as thin and not as slippery as with out the case, unfortunately, I just am not able to use it because it doesn't fit and now, with the rhinestones popping off, it doesn't look as good as it should.",55309,3
55309,"It's not a bad case, I just wouldn't buy another one because of the issues that I have had with it.",55309,3
55310,"I think the pair that I received
are irregular because the outer
right leg seem crosses over my
right shin.",55310,3
55310,"I therefore have to use
those pants strictly to mess them
up!",55310,3
55310,"I also paid full price for that
defect.",55310,3
55310,"The ones pictured on the
Model look perfect.",55310,3
55312,"Very thin fabric, also one that always feels like there is static and it's stuck to you.",55312,3
55313,I wished I knew beforehand this shirt was coming from China as their sizes run small.,55313,3
55313,I ordered a large and this fits a little tight.,55313,3
55313,I had expected it to be a little loose.,55313,3
55313,"Also, the material is sheer/thin,probably will need to wear a tank underneath.",55313,3
55313,"I like this shirt so I will try to make it work,just hope it doesn't shrink when I wash it.",55313,3
55314,The sleeves are not relaxed.,55314,3
55314,Maybe after some washing,55314,3
55315,The strap on the shoulder strap broke day one!,55315,3
55316,"Cute, but cheap looking.",55316,3
55317,The largest size was too small.,55317,3
55317,Too bad as I otherwise love the romper.,55317,3
55318,The quality is fair.,55318,3
55318,"Yes, very lightweight and color is prerty, but overall they just feel cheap.",55318,3
55318,"The boots part is like hard plastic, not like regular boot soles.",55318,3
55318,"Ordered a toddler 7, expecting them to be good all winter for my son who wears a 6 1/2 sneaker.",55318,3
55318,They are almost too small.,55318,3
55318,"Tight and short, compared to his rain boots of same size.",55318,3
55319,"I wore it one day,  with my ID on a rope, and it snagged abut 6 times.",55319,3
55319,It is now unsightly.,55319,3
55322,fits the shoulder very odd and the lace bottom hugs more then expected.,55322,3
55322,Not as lose as in the picture.,55322,3
55322,All in all its ok.,55322,3
55323,These do not fit over glasses.,55323,3
55323,They are very nice so I gave them to my granddaughters.,55323,3
55324,"The material is excellent, heavy weight..not cheap at all.",55324,3
55324,"I wear a medium and bought a large, the reviews  and I am 4 months pregnant.",55324,3
55324,I also wanted to use this dress again when I'm 7 months pregnant.,55324,3
55324,I'm basically swimming in it!,55324,3
55324,"I am 5 ft tall and always have to hem long length dresses..I can have a skirt made below my knees, that's how long this dress is!",55324,3
55324,Needless to say I will be having it tailored.,55324,3
55324,"It is a beautiful dress, true to it's color and for the price it's a great deal!",55324,3
55325,Was able to make it work but VERY SMALL & see through.,55325,3
55325,"I'm 5'1"", 110lbs & normally wear XS or S. Ordered a Medium for Comic-Con & it fit smaller than underwear.",55325,3
55325,Wound up returning & ordering XL.,55325,3
55325,Had to wear them sitting very low & wore black booty shorts underneath which I absolutely recommend since they're see through & very itchy otherwise.,55325,3
55325,3 stars because I was able to make them work & they're the only shorts that I could find that actually looked like Harley Quinns,55325,3
55326,"The dress is beautiful, but the top of the dress fit huge.",55326,3
55326,"I ordered a size up because I read the reviews how it runs small, it fit great in my waist but it is as if this dress was made for women with hugge upper body!",55326,3
55327,The wrist size accommodated would have been helpful.,55327,3
55327,"I have not given it yet to the Graduate, but expect that it will be too small",55327,3
55328,"Material is a little thick, arm holes are a bit small.",55328,3
55329,good quality but too small,55329,3
55330,"Great quality, but the cobalt tie isn't cobalt.",55330,3
55330,"For a wedding, so it just won't work.",55330,3
55331,I love the wallet and the quality of the leather.,55331,3
55331,However the snap that holds the wallet closed came off the day after that date I could return it for a replacement.,55331,3
55331,Now I am having difficulty finding a place that can repair my lovely wallet.,55331,3
55332,I kept the purse and am basically satisfied with it.,55332,3
55332,"Luckily, I was able to use a web strap from another bag to be able to wear as a shoulder bag.",55332,3
55332,The strap that came with it was unacceptable.,55332,3
55332,"It was ugly, cheap plastic and my husband and I couldn't configure it to make into a shoulder strap.",55332,3
55332,"The description was a little off on this product, but the price and size were right.",55332,3
55332,"It is a sturdy, roomy bag.",55332,3
55333,I really liked this.,55333,3
55333,It is very cute but the bow looks different from the picture.,55333,3
55333,"Thoigh, it is still very cute!",55333,3
55334,"I love how the bracelet looks although I am sad to say it came with one crack all the way through, I would recommend some sort of safety wrap so others don't have this happen as well.",55334,3
55335,Material was not what I expected.,55335,3
55335,It's comfortable but cozy like it looks in the picture.,55335,3
55335,It's almost like felt,55335,3
55336,Would have loved a larger bag.,55336,3
55336,But since this was a gift.,55336,3
55336,I do liked the tooled leather.,55336,3
55336,And it has feet.,55336,3
55336,Like the inside as well.,55336,3
55336,There looks like paint on the background.,55336,3
55336,It's suppose to look like that?,55336,3
55336,The purse online looks neat and clean where the tooling is.,55336,3
55336,Not crazy about the light brown purse.,55336,3
55336,But anyone can judge I guess.,55336,3
55336,I'm just always into detail with everything matching I wear or carry.,55336,3
55337,Drake shirts run big.,55337,3
55337,Should have purchased one size smaller for my husband.,55337,3
55337,Product description on the color was not what I received.,55337,3
55338,"they were nice quality, fast shipping, but very small, maybe for a child?",55338,3
55339,"Beatifull,  but run small",55339,3
55340,"The length is just at the length it's too short , the shoulders are too small, and the arm holes aren't right...but I gave it 3 stars because the material is nice, the price is cheap so I cut it open down  the front and made a tunic style top for my daughter.",55340,3
55342,It fits true to size.,55342,3
55342,"Like others have mentioned, very small pockets.",55342,3
55342,Not a fan of the shape very much.,55342,3
55342,I like to zip a vest like halfway and show my cami underneath.,55342,3
55342,"When you do this with this vest, the top doesn't spread, it looks as though it is completely zipped.",55342,3
55343,Only as a Halloween prop.,55343,3
55344,The large/extra large fits my 10 year old at least.,55344,3
55345,Didn't like the removable foam cups.,55345,3
55345,Look like they'll fall out of place while swimming g,55345,3
55346,"Not a very stretchy material, in fact, no matter how much downy I put on this it won't be soft.",55346,3
55346,When you lift your arms up the shirt goes with it and it makes me sweaty.,55346,3
55347,The price is too high for the quality.,55347,3
55347,"My Granddaughter loved it, but it's not very practical to swim in.",55347,3
55347,Would be great for a costume.,55347,3
55348,Nice dress but if you are curvy forget it do not buy!,55348,3
55349,It gets 3 stars because it's so pretty and I liked the appearance so much I bought it twice!,55349,3
55349,"BUT, the sizing runs SMALL!",55349,3
55349,You might need to go up 1-2 sizes.,55349,3
55349,"After 2 summers of wearing mine daily to work-out in my own pool, then rinsing and drip drying, it is all stretched out and is now 2 sizes too big and I  could never wear it anywhere besides my own backyard!",55349,3
55349,But I got 2 years of wear out of it so I was happy!,55349,3
55350,"odd shape cut for a sweater, but it does the job",55350,3
55351,It is a very nice suit but the top just didn't fit my daughter.,55351,3
55351,She has a very large cup size and we had hoped the top would cover more than it did.,55351,3
55351,The bottoms seems to fit fine.,55351,3
55353,I wanted to really like this and have it fit my daughter.,55353,3
55353,I did read the reviews and saw that some older kids got this but my 10 year old who weighs 125lbs got this and it was HUGE on her.,55353,3
55353,It had to go back.,55353,3
55353,It is really meant for a tall woman average build or a man.,55353,3
55354,The picture description made it look longer than it actually was.,55354,3
55355,"Two complaints: 1. there is a major panty line from thick edging on the leg holes  and  2. the cut is long on the hips, so it's almost between a brief and a boy-short.",55355,3
55355,But probably won't buy more because of the panty line.,55355,3
55357,They not the best quality but they ok,55357,3
55358,"Beads were larger then expected,would have liked it a lot better if they had been smaller.",55358,3
55359,This dress is a copy of a designer dress.,55359,3
55359,"The style is very pretty and it was well sewn but, as usual with copies, the material is a cheap nylon or polyester, and just not what it should be.",55359,3
55359,"There was also no inside bra, as stated in the description.",55359,3
55359,I was disappointed with the quality and returned mine.,55359,3
55360,I could barley hear my caller,55360,3
55361,Returned because too large...they advised to order 1 size up,55361,3
55362,**update: I tried to return the hat.,55362,3
55362,"After the restocking fees I would have ended up paying half of what the hat cost me, to actually return it and end up with nothing.",55362,3
55362,"I guess it's nice enough to mow the lawn with, until the loose palm strands probably grow to holes in a few months.",55362,3
55362,"**

While the pictured hat is certainly a decent product without holes (just several loose strands), it is not what I received.",55362,3
55362,"There are several reasons for this:
There are actually 3 ""8 second"" hats offered by Dallas Hats; none of them are what is posted in the seller's pictures;
The hat I received is actually called ""8 seconds B.""",55362,3
55362,"You can look at my pictures to know what kind of hat it is;
The hat ""8 seconds R"" somewhat resembles what is shown in the seller's picture, but the band is different, as are the vents on the crown (the Dallas Hats product's are roundish, while what the seller posted look like Xs instead).",55362,3
55362,I took some pictures for any possible buyers.,55362,3
55362,"Look up ""8 seconds B"" to get a decent look at what is being sold, or you can check out my pictures.",55362,3
55362,"Not a bad hat by any means, but it is one I'll return because it is simply not what I thought I was buying in the  first place.",55362,3
55362,"Here is a link to the three aforementioned hats (sorry for the quality of the last picture, it came out really dark):
[...]",55362,3
55364,The product did meet expectations.,55364,3
55365,Color is darker than picture .,55365,3
55366,I'm 5'4 130 and it felt tight and restricting and I got a medium for it to fit loose.,55366,3
55366,But fabric is nice.,55366,3
55367,Skirt is very big  my daughter normally wears a xlarge but it's big enough to fit me,55367,3
55368,"I ordered 32x32, which is the size for all my other pants including one from carhart I bought at the same time.",55368,3
55368,It fit more like a 30x32; the waist was too tight and the length was appropriate.,55368,3
55368,I have exchanged for 33x32 and will see how it fits.,55368,3
55368,"The material feels good, and I anticipate these lasting me for a while on work sites.",55368,3
55369,Some defects but for the price I can't complain,55369,3
55370,Very disappointed that the shipment didn't arrive as promised.,55370,3
55370,Came to late to use for 4th of July festivities.,55370,3
55371,I received a royal blue shirt not navy blue,55371,3
55374,"SO cute, but after a couple of washes the print has started to fade.",55374,3
55375,It is a sexy but top straps too short,55375,3
55376,"Looks pretty good, but seems really weak.",55376,3
55376,I would be afraid to wear it as a pin.,55376,3
55377,Provides great support and lots of lift but it does run a bit small.,55377,3
55377,I would order one chest size up (cup size seemed fine but the chest size ran tight).,55377,3
55378,"....Was my initial review however, the handle started cracking at the top, then totally disconnected, then the cross body handle hook threading...for some reason blue on one side of the handle and then black on the other side of the handle...started poking through.",55378,3
55378,"Looks nice, don't put too much in it, keep it for a special event.",55378,3
55378,The straps don't hold up for daily use.,55378,3
55379,Washed it once and it shrinked a lot.,55379,3
55379,"Recommend getting a size up but other than that, great shirt",55379,3
55380,cute but sizing was wrong.,55380,3
55380,order 2 sizes bigger,55380,3
55381,"I did not find the material attractive, so I returned it.",55381,3
55382,Decent shoe but starting to fall apart.,55382,3
55382,I wore this a bunch without socks and the moisture rubbed off all the marking on the inside of the shoe and some of the fabric on the inside has started to deteriorate.,55382,3
55382,"This was just basic usage, not introduced to water at all so not sure how these would hold up as boat shoes.",55382,3
55383,I am a large bought xtra large a bit small and tight also didn't come with a belt as shown,55383,3
55384,I normally wear a medium and this dress is slightly too big.,55384,3
55384,"Not the best quality, but what do you expect from a $20 dress?",55384,3
55384,The color is exactly like in the pictures.,55384,3
55384,It arrived earlier than the projected date which was nice.,55384,3
55384,I'm 5'6 and the dress fairly short.,55384,3
55384,"Overall, you get what you paid for.",55384,3
55385,a little bulky if you don't have big hands,55385,3
55386,sweater was way way too small for an XL.,55386,3
55386,Maybe I didn't read the information correctly about the sizing.,55386,3
55386,I gave it as a gift to a tiny girl - I don't know of any adult who could have worn it.,55386,3
55387,"Great print, it was simply too large.",55387,3
55388,Fits fine other than the bodice.,55388,3
55388,Very heavy on the draping.,55388,3
55389,Too small in the chest area.,55389,3
55389,Such a cute dress wish it would have fit.,55389,3
55390,"My daughter loves this sweatshirt, thin but nice and colorful",55390,3
55391,Tight around the hips,55391,3
55392,Love the dress but the size was way too small for what it should have been.,55392,3
55392,Was sad to return it.,55392,3
55393,Overall  I'm pretty much satisfied with this bathing suite.,55393,3
55393,However the top has no padding so therefore it gives you no support but it can easily be fixed by putting padding in the top.,55393,3
55393,Also you must wear something under the bottoms because the bottoms are not tight as expected depending on the size you chose.,55393,3
55393,But in the end I'm still able to wear the bathing suite after I fixed the problems.,55393,3
55394,Bought these for my daughter to wear at a wedding.,55394,3
55394,They are super cute!,55394,3
55394,"Be weary though, have your child wear socks or stockings with them.",55394,3
55394,My daughters feet hurt and she had blisters on the back of her heels from wearing them.,55394,3
55394,The rhinestone settings are not very secure and would snag on any fabric it slid up against (at one point she snagged on the bride's dress!!!,55394,3
55394,>_<) so by the end of the night a few of the gems were missing.,55394,3
55394,"They were inexpensive so that is a plus, especially for something that I was only going to have her wear maybe one time.",55394,3
55394,"So I would recommend if they are for a special occasion, but not for every-day use.",55394,3
55395,The Backpack needs improvement!,55395,3
55395,3 months hiking and the product is done.,55395,3
55395,"I really appreciated the side-bags, which made it easy to acess day-to-day items.",55395,3
55395,"But the cushins used for this product Meltau down to nothing after a month I carried the backpack (Yosemite, AT).",55395,3
55395,The Metal frame (kind of inner sceleton - but only a poor alupipe bowed) made its way out at the bottom and hurt my butt (lucky me the pipe was covered).,55395,3
55396,It was a tad too small and the stitching wasn't done well,55396,3
55397,It is longer than I thought it would be.,55397,3
55397,"Like, it dangles too far down.",55397,3
55397,And it rusts pretty fast so you can not leave it in very long.,55397,3
55397,But the color is as pictured.,55397,3
55398,"I'm a size 4 - 6, and I could have used something smaller than the small.",55398,3
55398,"Although I'm short (5'3"") the gown hit well above my ankles, and I prefer a longer length.",55398,3
55398,"The color, to my eye, is a bit too loud, and the print too big.",55398,3
55398,"Perfectly serviceable, but not a favorite.",55398,3
55399,Not as well made as I expected.,55399,3
55400,Received the wrong size,55400,3
55401,Smaller than i expected,55401,3
55402,"Was very cute not as form fitting as i would have hoped , next time i will go smaller !",55402,3
55403,I was looking for 8 Rue tunic that pains with plenty of room but this is way too tight to look like a tunic.,55403,3
55404,The Straps are meant for people with broad shoulders,55404,3
55405,Too small in waist only.,55405,3
55406,they were too small for the purpose intended,55406,3
55407,"I gave this 3 stars because although it was EXTREMELY small - (these are Asian women sizes not American women sizes), they offered to refund me.",55407,3
55407,Unless you are VERY small - even the extra large will be a tight fit.,55407,3
55408,"I was expecting a slightly thicker shirt, I was a bit disappointed when they arrived in the mail and found out that they were a bit thin.",55408,3
55408,"You also might want to consider ordering up a size, I normally use xl but with these a XXL might be a better fit.",55408,3
55410,It was too big for my arm,55410,3
55411,"cute hat but does run small  brim could be a bit wider,  The color is nice",55411,3
55412,So.... She me of the Saxx underwear fit exactly as you would expect and yet others are somewhat small.,55412,3
55412,This particular version....somewhat small.,55412,3
55412,"Now, that is not all that big of a deal because they don't ride up and they stay put on your leg.",55412,3
55412,"The (ahem) sack or Saxx is also tight... Read as ""higher riding"".",55412,3
55412,And that means the fabric has a tendency to lift your cargo up and separate it from your leg area in an rather uncomfortable manner.,55412,3
55412,"Trust me.. On this particular model, size up.",55412,3
55413,"I like it but it is too tight,  Would like to send back if I can find out how.",55413,3
55414,"The top is beautiful but unless you have perfectly set boobs or no boobs at all you will spill out of it,especially out the sides.",55414,3
55414,"It looksdecent with a flowy cardigan over it, but a little uncomfortable.",55414,3
55415,I got this in 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear.,55415,3
55415,"It does fit great on the bottom half, but the top is VERY revealing.",55415,3
55415,"I wear a c cup bra, and it did cover the girls somewhat, but only if I stood still and did not move.",55415,3
55415,My husband said no way in hell am I wearing THAT in public!,55415,3
55415,"Lol it is a cute design, but if you are larger than a double AA, expect the girls to go popping out before you even get in the water.",55415,3
55415,"A shame, really, because it is a nicely constructed suit for this pricel even if it is pretty skimpy on top",55415,3
55416,The laces come untied very easily,55416,3
55417,Sadly this amazing well made quality item was a WAY to small ....(SIGH).,55417,3
55418,size was to small,55418,3
55419,The bracket was beautiful but don't look the same as it was on the picture.,55419,3
55419,"All in all, its a pretty bracket.",55419,3
55420,by the time i started using this I was too big to actually use it.,55420,3
55420,i'll probably wear it after the baby is born to transition back into my old wardrobe.,55420,3
55420,in retrospect I'm not sure I would buy this product again.,55420,3
55420,Regular maternity pants are much more comfortable and versatile,55420,3
55421,It has a real vintage looks to it it is impressive,55421,3
55422,"It's a cute bracelet, and it looks like the picture displayed.",55422,3
55422,"It's also easy to wear with a magnetic clasp that holds the bracelet together, so no worries about losing the bracelet or having it fall off while looking adorable.",55422,3
55422,I wore it out shopping the first day I received it.,55422,3
55422,"It was comfortable, and I felt like a supreme bad ass while shopping for groceries.",55422,3
55422,"However, one of the straps popped out of its home (there are six thin straps), so the bracelet didn't look too cool with a strap hanging apart from its strap family, nor did my supremeness last.",55422,3
55422,"I used jewelry glue to mend the strap to its home, and so far the glue has performed well, maybe even better than the bracelet.",55422,3
55422,"But in fairness to the bracelet, it's held up, though I doubt I'll be strutting around in my supremeness unless I carry the glue with me.",55422,3
55423,So Cheaply made it ripped in one day,55423,3
55424,"I really love the print and the colors, but the skirt is a simple cotton skirt and is not worth nearly $70.",55424,3
55425,"I'm 5'5"" and usually a small-medium or size 6, 32D or 34C.",55425,3
55425,I ordered this in a large and it fit well.,55425,3
55425,It's overall thin and cheap.,55425,3
55425,The top was uncomfortable and unattractive.,55425,3
55425,I'm keeping it for the bottoms but don't expect it to last long.,55425,3
55426,I like because it fit me good but I dislike because the way a it was expecting,55426,3
55427,It is a beautiful watch but the picture on the band is fading.,55427,3
55428,Hard to keep tied on.,55428,3
55429,Nice sweater but way too small for size listing.,55429,3
55431,"It's a bit small for a size large
Otherwise it's a beautiful garment and well made",55431,3
55432,"It's cute, but the dress under is smaller (shorter) than I wanted and so I have to wear it as a shirt.",55432,3
55433,"Cute shirt, size up for sure.",55433,3
55433,Adorable though and just as pictured.,55433,3
55434,"Too bulky for me, but wonderful customer service!",55434,3
55435,"Totally bummed , they broke after a month",55435,3
55436,The quality of construction is good for the price.,55436,3
55437,These are comfortable but they are SO heavy.,55437,3
55437,I feel like I'm walking around with weights on my feet.,55437,3
55437,"Also, there is not much grip on the bottom of the shoe so I was slipping when I tried them on.",55437,3
55437,Think I'm going to return :-(,55437,3
55438,I followed the sizing chart to a T and ordered an XXL but it kinda swallowed my body .... so I should have stuck with my regular Large.,55438,3
55439,Wow these pants are skin tight!,55439,3
55439,I am a size 5 and ordered a medium.,55439,3
55439,It is a low-rise fit and honestly the crotch was so tight I had to wear a long shirt to cover that part off or risk showing off more than I intended.,55439,3
55439,I wish I had ordered a size bigger- I didn't because I'm almost never a Large.,55439,3
55439,I wish the pockets were fake because it was so tight the fabric kept bunching up and it was very obvious and difficult to smooth out..,55439,3
55439,It worked out for a Halloween costume but I'll never wear them again,55439,3
55440,These are very good looking and I so wanted to like them.,55440,3
55440,But they are really very tight!,55440,3
55440,"My previous pair was Yonex LX ladies' size 7.5, and I selected M6.5/W8 this time.",55440,3
55440,I thought these would be larger since they were half size bigger plus a unisex EX style (supposed to be wider than LX).,55440,3
55440,But they are so tight on the sides that I can't wear them comfortably.,55440,3
55440,"The cushion seems to be good, but unfortunately I can't use these at all and have to return them.",55440,3
55441,It does the job of pulling in my stomach but it rolls down in the back.,55441,3
55441,Pretty OK product for the price I paid.,55441,3
55442,"Cool, but a bit large.",55442,3
55443,A little awkward to get inside the boot.,55443,3
55444,Size and weight is great.,55444,3
55444,It keeps switching to military time and doesn't always change the day and date properly keeps analog time fine considering the price,55444,3
55445,It's a nice watch but did not fully meet my expectations.,55445,3
55445,Bought it a month ago.,55445,3
55445,Design: watch face looks much lighter then I expected.,55445,3
55445,"From the pictures it feels that it should be very dark but in reality the top half of the face is very light gray, and the bottom is darker but still much lighter than expected.",55445,3
55445,Quality: the watch feels very light and fragile.,55445,3
55445,"Strap came off, detached from the watch 3 times during the last month, caused by me tightening it too much (wasn't super tight though, it was still wearable with no discomfort at that point).",55445,3
55445,Easy to reattach the strap by hand but doesn't add to the quality feel of the product.,55445,3
55445,Time keeping: it's very hard to set it more or less precisely.,55445,3
55445,I have to set it up to ~20 min ahead of time for the watch to pick up the correct time.,55445,3
55445,"if it's 2pm then I have to set it to roughly 2.20pm, then it kinda sits there until 2.20pm and then starts showing correct time.",55445,3
55445,And it's hard to figure out the exact offset value.,55445,3
55445,Date display: the manual says that it comes pre-set for the date to roll-over at midnight.,55445,3
55445,"This wasn't my case, it was setup to roll over some time in the afternoon.",55445,3
55445,It's easy to set it correctly but I expected it to work out of the box.,55445,3
55445,Overall: it's a fine watch overall.,55445,3
55445,"I still like to wear it, still looks not bad, and it still shows the time.",55445,3
55445,The time and date setup are documented in the manual so it's not a big deal.,55445,3
55445,"But for the price and ""german-made"" tag I expected more refined product.",55445,3
55445,There are other makes which offer models which feel noticeably better in the same price range.,55445,3
55447,To small should of went with a bigger size,55447,3
55448,Printing a little off center but I love to send the message about 'My Hero' anyhow.,55448,3
55448,"Shirt is thin material, not a problem, and has survived several washings without damage.",55448,3
55449,its hard to find the right size for my twin daughters.,55449,3
55449,these was the only ones I was able to find small enough to fit but they are small on them.,55449,3
55449,if only I had a way to be able to measure to get the right size.,55449,3
55450,I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I typically wear and this blouse still fits snug!,55450,3
55450,I would recommend ordering 3 or more sizes larger for the correct fit.,55450,3
55450,The fit should be loose and flowy.,55450,3
55451,Size is a little small.,55451,3
55451,After washing and tumbling dry the shirt shrunk.,55451,3
55451,I can still wear it to work out but I like the longer flow of it original before I washed/dried it.,55451,3
55452,"Top part fits great, material is comfortable.",55452,3
55452,"The pants did not fit, they were way to short, I""m 6'2 so I used pants from another sherwani I have.",55452,3
55453,It was too small for a XL size on the label.,55453,3
55454,This particular color is on the small side--it fits differently than the other two hats I have by this same company.,55454,3
55455,"I really like all the slots for cards, cash and ID.",55455,3
55455,But it adds too much weight to my shoulder bag.,55455,3
55455,I also find it difficult to tug my cards out of slots.,55455,3
55455,I do like it -just needs some tweaking.,55455,3
55456,The price is fair for the quality.,55456,3
55456,"Other reviews are correct, there is no beading on this dress only the sequins.",55456,3
55456,The stiching around the edge of the sequins makes the dress look unfinished.,55456,3
55456,The color was the perfect pink I was looking for though.,55456,3
55456,Overall the dress is just ok.,55456,3
55457,"The ring fits and has not turned my finger green,  which is amazing.",55457,3
55457,"However,  the color is lighter than pictured in the purple which is disappointing and my reason for only 3 stars.",55457,3
55457,I will try to attach a photo.,55457,3
55457,Update: a few days later this ring started to turn from sliver to that copper-ish color.,55457,3
55458,"Would have liked the fabric to be just a little thicker, but otherwise a good purchase.",55458,3
55459,way small for an XL,55459,3
55460,You cannot beat the price of these dresses.,55460,3
55460,"They (I bought blue and yellow) are a bit flimsy, edges turn up so you have to iron or accept.",55460,3
55460,But overall they fit great on my plus size body.,55460,3
55460,The blue is not the pretty powdered blue as shown in the picture it is more of a grey/blue but it still looks great.,55460,3
55460,I always get a compliment or two when I wear these dresses.,55460,3
55460,The shelf is not deep so bustier women such as myself may need to wear a bra and a cardigan.,55460,3
55461,Cute bag it inside zipper fell of first time I used it!,55461,3
55462,company is working on exchanging with me- issue is very very long arms and too short legs.,55462,3
55462,"Very soft though, and if fitted babies properly, would be adorable and warm",55462,3
55463,This bikini is absolutely  adorable.,55463,3
55463,It would be a 5 star rating but the sizing is way off.,55463,3
55463,I wear a size 4 and 34d chest.,55463,3
55463,I ordered a large after reading reviews.,55463,3
55463,I definitely need an extra large.,55463,3
55463,Even the  reviews about sizing confused me.,55463,3
55464,Not as bright as shown.,55464,3
55464,Still a nice ring.,55464,3
55465,"I have a wrist which is almost 5 inches in circumference, the bracelet was still too big.",55465,3
55465,"If you have pliers, then an alteration can be done, no biggy.",55465,3
55466,"The little ball at the end where you insert into the nose was sorta weird and a little painful at first, bt they worked well.",55466,3
55467,kind of hard to tell that it is french fries.,55467,3
55468,I ordered the biggest size(3X) and it was small; I usually wear a 2-3X.,55468,3
55468,I got it on but was very uncomfortable.,55468,3
55468,Have not worn it since lol,55468,3
55469,This outfit was sooooo cute.,55469,3
55469,My little hunny got to wear it for about an hour and then the black part at the bottom of the skirt separated from the pink polka dot part.,55469,3
55469,Looks like a defect in the fabric.,55469,3
55469,The ribbon for the bow was too long too.,55469,3
55469,But it was cute while she had it on.,55469,3
55470,The jacket they sent was not the same jacket as pictured.,55470,3
55470,"It is a very comfortable jacket, but not as nice looking as pictured.",55470,3
55470,"This is a very casual jacket, but it is very soft and quite comfortable.",55470,3
55471,Ordered up a size (L) for some freedom of movement during sleep; fit is as expected.,55471,3
55471,"A couple of things that could be changed for the better:  (1)  Get rid of the (very) scratchy tag at the back of the neck; (2) Get rid of the ribbon at the front--although cute, it has a tendency to get wet when bending over the sink to wash your face.",55471,3
55471,"Economical PJs, should last a few years.",55471,3
55472,"Very cheap looking, would not recommend.",55472,3
55473,not exactly what I thought.,55473,3
55473,I thought the lips on the case was raised.,55473,3
55474,"There isn't quite enough supply in the top, BUT it might just be because it fits rather large.",55474,3
55474,I have to return it for that reason.,55474,3
55475,Not as nice as expected but decent.,55475,3
55476,The quality is below par.,55476,3
55476,Lots of hanging thread and over sewing.,55476,3
55476,The size was definitely too big based on the size chart.,55476,3
55476,"My wife is from China and measures 32, 26, 33.",55476,3
55476,"This should have been a Medium, but it's big.",55476,3
55476,I have discovered that most clothing from China tends to run a bit small.,55476,3
55476,"Either way, it's big.",55476,3
55476,She usually wears an XS or S (0-2) when we shop locally.,55476,3
55476,"The buttons are on the left, not on the right as depicted.",55476,3
55476,"Also, there are only two button holes (bottom two obviously) so the rest are decorative only.",55476,3
55476,The material is thin and somewhat revealing if that's to your liking.,55476,3
55477,It looks navy blue and not dark gray.,55477,3
55477,I am hopeful they will look ok with my bridesmaids dresses.,55477,3
55477,Just wish it was a true gray.,55477,3
55478,"I'm 160 pounds, 5'4 and I ordered the XL and its way too big.",55478,3
55478,Probably could've wore a large.,55478,3
55479,Thought these had a bow on the hat.,55479,3
55480,Looks just as described and pictured but does not fit well for someone who may normally wear mismatched bikini sizes.,55480,3
55480,I am 5'4 and 105 lbs but a little top heavy for my size.,55480,3
55480,Usually wear medium bikini tops and small bottoms so the top part was a bit ill fitting.,55480,3
55480,However still very cute and wearable!,55480,3
55481,"It works, and was easy to get into my Oakleys using the online videos on every video channel.",55481,3
55481,"But, the lens is quite a bit darker than my original Oakley lenses, and not as clear.",55481,3
55481,"Also, while the fit is fine, it's not perfect; even well-seated, it still has light at the bottom corners from an imprecise fit, and it rattles slightly inside the frame.",55481,3
55481,"I would buy it again in the event of a cracked Oakley original lens, but certainly not just to change the color or mirroring of an original lens.",55481,3
55482,I was suprised it shipped really fast.,55482,3
55482,It's not exactly high quality but I didn't expect a lot for the price.,55482,3
55482,Definetly don't get if your piercing is easily irritated because even with Vaseline it is a little hard to get in.,55482,3
55482,Also beware that 1.5 inches is pretty long.,55482,3
55482,Overall I would recommend it but maybe in a shorter size.,55482,3
55483,This bracelet was extremely misleading from photo.,55483,3
55483,"Like several others I've purchased just recently, it's well made, will probably last quite awhile, but the photo shows grey and lavender.",55483,3
55483,"This is an extremely dark shade of grey that basically appears black and the lavender is bright purple; what I consider ""electric"".",55483,3
55483,It reminds me of fluorescence.,55483,3
55483,"Children's party favor, or Sunday School grab bag....perfect.",55483,3
55483,"3 stars are for craftsmanship and the ""suede"" PU being so much better than the ""high polished"" plastic stuff.",55483,3
55483,And of course the low cost.,55483,3
55483,Just make sure you aren't expecting soft grey and misty lavender.,55483,3
55484,The top fit great but the bottoms were ridiculously small.,55484,3
55484,I will not wear them in public.,55484,3
55485,"I usually wear pearl, or faux pearl earrings, but I wanted some in other colors to coordinate with outfits.",55485,3
55485,These were extremely affordable and gave me the options I was looking for.,55485,3
55485,"Now granted I have never had an issue with wearing any sort of earrings in the past and I always clean earrings before I wear them, but I did not have any trouble with these irritating my ears or anything.",55485,3
55485,The colors are pretty and there is a nice variety.,55485,3
55485,The only down side is the backs are rubber.,55485,3
55485,"They give you a ton of them, but I prefer the metal backings.",55485,3
55486,The weight and style were great but the size was smaller than I thought.,55486,3
55486,Exchanged for next size up.,55486,3
55486,I am waiting on the exchange to arrive,55486,3
55487,Well made and thick 6 oz quality material.,55487,3
55487,This shirt is definitely rugged and made for the outdoors.,55487,3
55487,Styling does not stand out but those that know the Filson brand will recognize the subtle lines of this shirt.,55487,3
55487,I would rate it higher if it was made in USA.,55487,3
55488,Runs a full size too large.,55488,3
55488,Mother gets a new shirt.,55488,3
55489,"Nice chain, again too short and wants to fall off my neck.",55489,3
55490,Pretty top but not for me.,55490,3
55490,I have other tops that are the same brand.,55490,3
55490,This top is much shorter than the other ones I have.,55490,3
55490,I am tall and have a long torso and this top was just not long enough.,55490,3
55490,I sold it to a shorter coworker and she really likes it.,55490,3
55490,Very pretty but the lace does seem delicate so be careful for that.,55490,3
55491,"They look more ""denim"" than ""black"" to me so I returned them.",55491,3
55491,"I cannot really say how the fit was, I didn't remove them from the package simply due to the color.",55491,3
55492,"I order XL The top is a little bit big, I have to adjust the straps,bottom fit ok ( its look like top XL and bottom M ) Its made with cheap fabric -but looks good -very cute style -looks exactly like picture but size and material are far from ok -you get what you pay for it",55492,3
55493,This is an ok shawl.,55493,3
55493,I bought it to wear with tanks for easy nursing a newborn.,55493,3
55493,The tan color is a little darker than the pic.,55493,3
55493,"Not as ""spring like"" of a color as I had hoped.",55493,3
55493,"Also when I purchased, I didn't notice the gathers on the front of the shoulder area.",55493,3
55493,Makes the shawl lay odd on me.,55493,3
55493,For the price I'll keep and use as a swim cover.,55493,3
55494,Cute pajamas but run extremely small.,55494,3
55494,The XL won't even fit my 9 yr. old.,55494,3
55495,Good quality but not exact color as picture and smell funny.,55495,3
55496,"Material was poor, jewel was cheap however the fit is ok.",55496,3
55498,I like the material but a little tight,55498,3
55499,too small but it did arrive on time,55499,3
55500,I wasn't impressed with this top.,55500,3
55500,Thin material and really long.,55500,3
55501,I ordered a small but it was still very large on me.,55501,3
55501,Be careful when ordering.,55501,3
55502,"I like the feel of the material, it's thick and soft, but these were not the typical side snap onesies I had expected.",55502,3
55502,I should have looked closer at the picture.,55502,3
55502,"I assumed the snaps went all the way down the side, but they don't.",55502,3
55502,This is no different than a regular onesie that needs to be pulled down or over.,55502,3
55502,I was thinking they were like the side snaps that open the while thing top to bottom.,55502,3
55503,"This selection of stuff definitely doesn't come in that nice box as shown, and the gauge of them is really small.",55503,3
55504,"Thought it would be more silky, but it's nice and fits.",55504,3
55505,It's cute and came in on time.,55505,3
55505,I read reviews about how it's made and decided to buy the XXL to be safe but it was too small across my chest area.,55505,3
55505,I'm not sending it back because my daughter can wear it.,55505,3
55506,weird material and sizes run a bit small,55506,3
55507,The for is true.,55507,3
55507,Of course it doesn't fall on everybody type the way it looks.,55507,3
55507,I don't think it is as flattering.,55507,3
55507,"The material isn't what I expected, I should have read better.",55507,3
55507,Silky comes to mind I hope it isn't to hot for the beach.,55507,3
55508,OK for the price.,55508,3
55509,Cute but kinda bulky and also has strange smell when you first receive it.,55509,3
55509,Used it for less than a day,55509,3
55510,It's not as thick as the picture portrays.,55510,3
55510,"Pretth thin material, and the leather patches are kind of awkward.",55510,3
55511,HAs to have special handling for washing.,55511,3
55512,it's nice and good!,55512,3
55512,i hope to have more deal with you with other item and more quality.,55512,3
55513,This hat is very cute but does not fit as shown in the picture.,55513,3
55513,It's not very slouch at all.,55513,3
55514,"I liked the Dress, but it was not true to size so unfortunately I will have to return it.",55514,3
55515,My son loves it but broke the set dial off the first day trying to adjust the time each time he saw a different clock did not have the same time as his.,55515,3
55515,Since I figured it was him and not the watch being defective I have not pursued a replacement.,55515,3
55518,"the chain isn't clamped tight enough so pieces may fall off easily, us plyers to gently clasp tighter",55518,3
55521,First of all I ordered a Large and received an Extra Large.. so obviously it was too big as it was the wrong size.,55521,3
55521,"Second, the description says this is lined outside and inside, but there is no lining on the outside.. it is just a weird plastic looking material.",55521,3
55521,Other people commented about the bulk in the back and I got the same issue.,55521,3
55521,Had to return it,55521,3
55522,"Looks as cheap as pictured, couldn't be disappointed, given the price.",55522,3
55523,It's beautiful for beach photos but was way bigger then ad said some what disappointed,55523,3
55524,"It's cute, but kind of small.",55524,3
55524,It doesn't have much stretch.,55524,3
55524,I think my daughter will wear it.,55524,3
55526,"Beautiful and nicely made, but is it real leather all around?",55526,3
55527,The dress in the picture looks like the fabric is thicker and not see through.,55527,3
55527,It is VERY sheer and VERY see through.,55527,3
55527,"You have to some how add a layer underneath to wear this out in pubic, perhaps a long slip.",55527,3
55528,This was very nice and quality was good but looked like something my grandmother would wear.,55528,3
55528,I returned it and got something different,55528,3
55529,Worked great but I only have worn it twice and it already has a hole in it.,55529,3
55530,"It is a bit big for a small frame person ,but is a beautifully patterned dress.",55530,3
55531,A few earrings were not what i was expecting,55531,3
55532,The bottoms rides up my crack,55532,3
55533,This is a decent watch.,55533,3
55533,"It's time seems to drift a little quickly, even for a cheaper watch, but my main criticism is that the crystal scratched super easy.",55533,3
55533,"It's still okay for  $25 watch, but I was rather surprised.",55533,3
55534,"Love the top, but it is a VERY clingy material.",55534,3
55535,I'm all about the cheap sunglasses.,55535,3
55535,These are no exception.,55535,3
55535,I like them for the most part but they came basically squished and bent.,55535,3
55535,I haven't been able to bend them back into the exact right shape yet.,55535,3
55536,the material is clingy,55536,3
55537,Not a flattering fit at all.,55537,3
55537,The material is beautiful and the colors are bright.,55537,3
55537,But the fit of this dress just did not flatter my body type.,55537,3
55537,"If you are Plus Size, you may run into the same issue I did - you need a smaller waist for this to look good.",55537,3
55537,I looked like a red and white polka dotted barrel.,55537,3
55538,"Not the picture of course, I have seen the pictured jacket and I have it as well, this jacket you are currently looking at is a whole another brand/Item the captain America emblem is smaller and the jacket is just down right thicker for more warmth.",55538,3
55538,"But anyways its still pretty cool just don't expect the one as shown expect something, somewhat different",55538,3
55539,Onky if u have small bombs,55539,3
55540,It's stiff maybe after I wash it with fabric softener it will be fine.,55540,3
55541,I didn't realize that I needed to put the belt together once it came in the mail.,55541,3
55543,I love the bracelet but it's too large around my wrist.,55543,3
55543,"My wrist measures 6""",55543,3
55545,"beautiful bracelet, a shame they are becoming tarnish so soon.",55545,3
55546,Beads are much bigger than they appear in photo,55546,3
55547,"These served their purpose, although the ""touchscreen"" tips weren't that great (but I didn't need that necessarily).",55547,3
55547,But they were delivered quickly and keep my fingers warm!,55547,3
55548,"The hat is adorable and well made, but is way to big for a newborn.",55548,3
55548,I bought the hat for his newborn pics so I will have to find another one that will fit him.,55548,3
55550,pants seem a little short but will still work.,55550,3
55550,top was as expected.,55550,3
55551,The pocket has extra material that could have been done cleaner.,55551,3
55553,I found the grips was not as sturdy as expected and it pulls easily on rough surfaces,55553,3
55554,This item came just as it was advertised.,55554,3
55554,There was nothing wrong with it at all.,55554,3
55554,"I guess I just expected too much, because I thought it would be padded as well.",55554,3
55554,"*Ladies if you plan to buy this, also buy nippies.",55554,3
55555,It was a little bigger than I thought it would be.,55555,3
55555,I also used it for my tragus so it was really hard to screw the back ball to it.,55555,3
55556,Not fond of front cross ties.. Looks cheap.,55556,3
55557,The suit fits ok.,55557,3
55557,The skirt is a bit long.,55557,3
55558,the color is lighter than was shown in the picture.,55558,3
55558,If I had known how light it was I would not have purchased them,55558,3
55559,This was a little small.,55559,3
55559,My teenager still liked it and got a lot of compliments at her high school for it.,55559,3
55561,I had some what of a time getting the dress but after getting it all I heard was how beautiful it is.,55561,3
55561,You have to be careful very careful with it because some of the rhinestone were very loose and some fell off.,55561,3
55562,Jacket fit but pants to small.,55562,3
55563,It was advertised as a 10 inch plush and it was only 8 inches.,55563,3
55563,My son was disappointed.,55563,3
55564,n/a gave as gift,55564,3
55565,Will be sending back because its too tight in the arms,55565,3
55566,I ordered a pair of these for a bride and her maid of honor...only one arrived in the package marked for both.,55566,3
55566,The dangling pendant with the Gallifreyan writing on it hangs lopsided and is extremely light and cheap.,55566,3
55566,"The decoration on the dangling portion is obviously a sticker with a glossy finish on it, and is actually not as detailed up close as one would like.",55566,3
55566,"I'm in contact with the seller, but not very happy so far.",55566,3
55567,The dress is a bit hard to put on becuase of the neck being so tight it's hard to fit over my head.,55567,3
55567,The front and back of the dress are essentially the same so if you have breast prepare for side boobs action.,55567,3
55567,Also I couldn't really wear a bra because of the shape of the bust I'm a small person and ordered a small and it is skin tight on me but I really love the fabric and the color.,55567,3
55567,recommend for thinner people or go up a size if you have larger breasts.,55567,3
55568,"It was too big, and I wear a small!",55568,3
55568,"Beautiful belt though, very well made.",55568,3
55569,Product was waay too big,55569,3
55570,needs to be a tad larger,55570,3
55571,"Kinda flimsy, some fraying of the threads, but it'll do.",55571,3
55572,I had hopes for this swim suit.,55572,3
55572,"The length is very decieving, I am fairly short 5'2"" and 140.",55572,3
55572,"The hole in the swimsuit was at my belly button, not like the photo shown.",55572,3
55572,The leg holes are tiget and sit fairly high.,55572,3
55573,"Very nice for the price, but mine came smelling really funky.",55573,3
55573,After letting it air out for a few days I finally decided to try washing it.,55573,3
55573,I ran it through a delicate cycle in my washing machine.,55573,3
55573,"It held up for the wash and that helped, but the smell isn't completely gone.",55573,3
55574,"Cute, but way too short.",55574,3
55575,The fit was way too small.,55575,3
55575,"Despite using the sizing information, which showed the S/M should have fit fine, it wasn't and was off by one size.",55575,3
55575,The quality was average and although using care putting them on it easily ran.,55575,3
55576,looked great but i thought it would be slightly bigger,55576,3
55577,"Too small, color not as pictured.",55577,3
55577,I would have returned it but they gave me a partial refund.,55577,3
55578,Big to be a small but it's nice looking with legging and boots,55578,3
55579,I'm in this weird backwards Goldielocks situation with Inov-8 right now...,55579,3
55579,This is the 3rd pair I've tried to buy from them.,55579,3
55579,"The 1st (one of their weightlifting shoes) fit perfectly, the 2nd (this same shoe but a men's version) was WAY to small despite being the correct size, and this pair, also technically the correct size, was WAY too big.",55579,3
55579,"I normally wear a 10.5 in athletic shoes, which is what I ordered, but this shoe was too wide and had almost a full inch of extra length in the toe box.",55579,3
55579,I'm going to try once more but I'm REALLY starting to get frustrated here.,55579,3
55579,They desperately need to update and standardize their sizing charts.,55579,3
55580,Sizing is 2 to 3 sizes too small.,55580,3
55580,EXTREMELY body conscious and body hugging so size up accordingly.,55580,3
55580,"Also, dress material was thin but extremely soft with almost a plush feel against the skin.",55580,3
55580,"Once I reordered it 2 sizes up, I was very pleased and got so many compliments!",55580,3
55581,It's OK. ... cheap material.,55581,3
55582,Not what  i expected,55582,3
55583,"Cute and fits well, but the bow fell off the first time I washed it lol",55583,3
55584,It was fine at first but then my mom washed it not knowing that it had to be handwashed because there was no tags on it.,55584,3
55585,Very cute--just as advertised.,55585,3
55585,"The wallet overall feels very cheap...I will be giving this away as a game prize, so it will work just fine for my purposes; however it is very over-priced.",55585,3
55586,The fit was perfect and the sticky stuff lasted all night ( might I mention I wasn't sweating so who knows otherwise ) this could have gotten 5 stars IF it hadn't ripped after only one night of wearing it !,55586,3
55586,"As such, I can't tell you how long the stickyness lasts nor if it stays strong through a night of dancing because I only got to use it once -_-",55586,3
55587,"they do include the glasses, nice touch, the material for the top piece  is well, inexpensive, as the price is.",55587,3
55587,"I do think with maybe a strapless bra underneath I can give this some umph...but it's not quite what I was hoping for, suffice it to say it looks better on the model than me.",55587,3
55587,"if you're a bit shorter and bustier, but also thin.",55587,3
55587,this might be perfect.,55587,3
55587,"I'm 5'7"" and it just seems like my torso is too long and this sort of stretches flat over me.",55587,3
55588,size runs a little small the bottom has no grips its like a slippery black flat soul that doesnt hold up to well if you have nails sticking up in the floor it cuts the bottom right away,55588,3
55589,"Pants are somewhat too wide
Top is fine.",55589,3
55590,"I followed the size chart in the display pic and ordered a LG and 5ft 4"" 160lbs however when it arrived it was a sz to big so advised to follow amazon size chart for sizing also the pic show the back is low cut but it reaches mid back also the pic in display show a stitch in the mid back so the dress can laid neatly how the dress does has the stitch it the material is see through",55590,3
55591,"The material is beautiful, but it was too large for me.",55591,3
55591,The tag actually says XL.,55591,3
55591,"I am 5'5"" and 150 pounds, with 36"" around the breast - I was swimming in this shirt; it was not a flattering sillouette.",55591,3
55591,It's such a shame because I really love the pattern.,55591,3
55593,As for all three shirts after laundering I found them not to be as long as prior to washing.,55593,3
55593,They are OK but I wanted a longer loosed shirt.,55593,3
55594,Great tummy control and fit.,55594,3
55594,"Lift is not significant, hard to blend under anything besides jeans",55594,3
55595,kinda skimpy.....not horrible but not great.,55595,3
55595,Wanted it a bit fuller.,55595,3
55596,I have a small head and this hat is still tight.,55596,3
55596,The top of the hood doesn't cover enough of my forehead so I still had to wear my other hat.,55596,3
55596,It is thick fleece and very soft.,55596,3
55596,Kept my nose and neck warm.,55596,3
55596,Not Breathable fabric and just breathing causes it to get wet feeling when over you mouth.,55596,3
55596,Perfect for a child!,55596,3
55596,Passing this one down to the baby and getting myself a bigger size.,55596,3
55596,Not an adult size.,55596,3
55598,I actually had to complete the sweater once it was delivered with sewing it.,55598,3
55598,The seams were not complete and the sweater was fringing already.,55598,3
55598,"Order two other one waiting to see what condition these are going to be in, disappointed.",55598,3
55599,A little bit shorter than I wanted.,55599,3
55600,really small on one side and lon on the other but looks cute with jeans or leggings under it.,55600,3
55601,2 of the zipper hooks broke after 2 months of use.,55601,3
55601,"Luckily, there was another zipper on the same line for one, and the other I just have to deal with.",55601,3
55601,"Other than that, it gets the job done, but I wish I still had function in all the zippers.",55601,3
55602,It is a beautiful and flattering dress!!,55602,3
55602,"However, it definitely fit smaller than expected.",55602,3
55602,I was 6.5 months pregnant when I wore it and unfortunately I think it was a one time dress as I can't imagine fitting into it again.,55602,3
55602,It was also pointed out to me it was somewhat see through in the light.,55602,3
55603,I need to go up to xl im 5'5 155 38b,55603,3
55604,Its small but nice tie,55604,3
55605,"I'm giving these 3 starts because they are good leggings, just not what I wanted them for.",55605,3
55605,I was planning on using these for running.,55605,3
55605,I liked the high waist and the pockets so I thought they would be perfect.,55605,3
55605,I was really disappointed.,55605,3
55605,"First of all, you shouldn't use these if you'll be sweating at all.",55605,3
55605,"They are not wicking at all, so the sweat pools up.",55605,3
55605,I went for a run in these today and when I was done it looked like I had peed myself from the sweat pooling up where the thighs touch.,55605,3
55605,"Also, when I took them off, my legs were full of black fuzzies from the leggings.",55605,3
55605,They were also all over my arms and on my face from when I wiped my sweat while running.,55605,3
55605,"All in all, these are useless for what I wanted them for, but I'm sure they would be great for doing yoga or some light weightlifting.",55605,3
55606,"Super cute... love the color/print
Very comfortable
Run a little small, still able to wear them!",55606,3
55607,Its OK for the price.,55607,3
55607,Not a hundred dollar belt so don't expect hundred dollar quality.,55607,3
55607,Says made in the USA with imported materials.,55607,3
55607,Its fine for the price.,55607,3
55608,"I ordered a size bigger to be safe, but this shirt is a midriff.",55608,3
55608,"Other than that, it's a nice shirt for any occasion where a little baring of the mid section is in order.",55608,3
55609,The top squishes your boobs down like a sports bra so it's gonna make you look flat chested with a uni-boob.,55609,3
55609,But the bottoms make your butt look great!!,55609,3
55609,"Word of caution it exposes a lot of cheek, but if you don't mind then go for it.",55609,3
55609,I would also size up!,55609,3
55611,"Love it just to big on top, I'll have to send it back",55611,3
55612,Re-Ordered X-Large (I wear a medium...) Gave the medium to my 11 yr old son...,55612,3
55613,"Cute print, but runs small.",55613,3
55614,"I knew it would be small so I ordered big, still not as big as I thought but wearable.",55614,3
55614,"No tags to figure out front from the back, but not a terrible shirt.",55614,3
55614,Just don't dry it!,55614,3
55615,The small is very small across the chest.,55615,3
55615,The medium is more like a small - however extremely long for our six yr olds.,55615,3
55615,Not sure what to do - either return both or hem the medium,55615,3
55616,I feel for the price it just feels weak.,55616,3
55616,Worried it could break/rip.,55616,3
55617,"It's a nice, well put togetger hat but the front part is kind of small.",55617,3
55617,I originally bought it for a guy but it'll be too small for him.,55617,3
55617,Only but if it's for a girl!,55617,3
55620,"Looks as shown, but too small and came with stains on it.",55620,3
55621,My pinkie toe keeped escaping the shoe,55621,3
55622,First the color is beautiful but definitely toupe not pink.,55622,3
55622,Not even a biege blush color.,55622,3
55622,Second this dress is probably not great for people with short torsos.,55622,3
55622,Although the waist and dress length fit me the top was too long and i will have to pin or alter the dress for a better fit,55622,3
55623,"The quality is there, but the dress runs  two sizes small; unless your into peel off clothing.",55623,3
55624,Make sure you buy a large if you're a small.,55624,3
55625,My hair doesn't really get caught often but the ball fell out and I lost the earring randomly.,55625,3
55626,Super cute but my only problem is that if there are too many coins in the coin pocket the snap button closure for the main pocket keeps opening.,55626,3
55626,I wish it had a strap that flaps over cuz it makes me nervous that my cards will fall out.,55626,3
55627,"I am 5'9"", about 150 lbs and I bought a size Large which was way too big.",55627,3
55627,"The neckline was so large my bra was hanging out and due the fact that there is fringe on the shoulder straps, it is not easily modified.",55627,3
55627,"For this reason, I had to return it.",55627,3
55627,"Other than that, it looked pretty decent for $20.",55627,3
55628,Product is well made but an XXL is more like an adult small or maybe a medium in US sizes.,55628,3
55629,"I liked it, but it was too short to wear as a dress.",55629,3
55629,"I still wore it with leggings and it looked just as cute, though.",55629,3
55630,"I love this dress, and the way it is designed.",55630,3
55630,"Just a couple of things that might need to be noted- the dress runs larger than my usual size, I ordered a M, but needed a small.",55630,3
55630,"However, I was time limited, and couldn't order the small, so I just tightened it with the belt a little more than I was supposed to :).",55630,3
55630,"The dress is not held by the belt, it is just a fashion accessory.",55630,3
55630,Another thing I'd like to mention is that the dress is very see through.,55630,3
55630,"It's a flowy dress, but with white undies, you will see every mark.",55630,3
55630,"Thankful, I had a slip I wore underneath, but then that brings me to the other issue.",55630,3
55630,"The slit is rather high, and when I walked or danced, you could see the slip underneath.",55630,3
55630,Nothing a little safety pin won't fix though.,55630,3
55630,This dress worked out for me - especially for the price.,55630,3
55630,Just wish it had a sewn it slip and I ordered a size down.,55630,3
55630,I did also order the blush color- and that dress looks like a silk robe and is COMPLETELY see through.,55630,3
55630,"The material is completely different from the white with black and brown dress, and I would not recommend that dress unless you're looking for a sexy robe.",55630,3
55633,I ordered this in an extra large for a  few reasons.,55633,3
55633,"One- I have huge 38ff boobs so I trust nothing on the web, Two -it's coming from china and their stuff is usually tiny, and Three - All the reviews stated that it ran small so order a size up....",55633,3
55633,This thing is huge on me.,55633,3
55633,"I'm not necessarily ""skinny"" for my height and not one part of this hugs my body and the shorts are saggy.",55633,3
55633,"Definitely not what I was looking forward to and somewhat disappointing, but for $11 I can't really complain.",55633,3
55633,"I just hope that with a nice hot wash, it might shrink up a bit.",55633,3
55635,The blouse is nice but is too small,55635,3
55636,More see through than it appears in the picture and much thinner,55636,3
55638,"Nice shirt, runs a little small.",55638,3
55638,Writing and image was very dim.,55638,3
55638,More like a gray color than black.,55638,3
55638,Also much smaller in size than the picture showed.,55638,3
55639,"This bag is really cute, and all the pockets are great.",55639,3
55639,However I could not get past the smell.,55639,3
55639,"Had some problems with the zippers, however I think that may be due to how they folded it to pack and ship it.",55639,3
55639,"I am not positive on that, but that is the only thing i could think that would effect the zippers.",55639,3
55639,"Other then that it seems like a good bag, but i had to return mine unfortunately.",55639,3
55640,Fits small but well made shirt.,55640,3
55641,"The fabric feels amazing, snug and soft, but there is just not enough room for me.",55641,3
55641,"I'm 5'2, 130 lbs with most of my weight in my lower half and I really have to pull these puppies up to get the crotch area in the right place.",55641,3
55641,Even then it will begin to sag down as I walk around.,55641,3
55641,"Shame because again the feel of these on my legs is great, just the crotch area doesn't seem quite right for me.",55641,3
55641,I think these would be fine for more petite peeps.,55641,3
55642,Outfit is super cute.,55642,3
55642,I ordered a 4T for a small for her age 4 year old and the pants look really tiny.,55642,3
55642,I will update as soon as I can try the outfit on her.,55642,3
55642,Colors are vibrant (I ordered red) and material is not flimsy.,55642,3
55643,"Good chain, link strong.",55643,3
55644,"cute but looks like child size instead of adult, had to give it away :(",55644,3
55645,"Love the pattern... the material is a bit see through, nothing a pair of bike shorts or a slip couldn't fix, however, it's pretty short.",55645,3
55645,"Like, don't plan on bending down or anything.",55645,3
55646,"Pretty and great for the price, but a little larger and more loose than I was hoping.",55646,3
55646,The sleeve length is kind of awkward.,55646,3
55647,I purchased size large but the flex waist is very stiff.,55647,3
55647,I wear 10/12 and skirt came listed as large and it didn't fit.,55647,3
55647,I kept the skirt but have it away.,55647,3
55648,"Fit perfect, bust was a tad low (showed the edge of my bra from the side).",55648,3
55648,The problem I had with this dress is that though the design and print were fantastic it looked cheap.,55648,3
55648,"The construction was cheap, the fabric was somewhat thin and just didn't do it for me.",55648,3
55649,Definitely get a larger size than your original size.,55649,3
55650,"Very cheaply made, clasp broke not too long after wearing it.",55650,3
55650,if was made better I would buy again!,55650,3
55651,"Nice design, but I didn't like the quality of the leather.",55651,3
55653,XXL is actually US medium,55653,3
55654,Loved material and pattern.,55654,3
55654,Too small and no larger size to exchange to.,55654,3
55655,After one wash it came out with a whole where the stitching had come undone.,55655,3
55655,I love it though.,55655,3
55656,Looks just like the photo just reaaaaalllllly small i would go two sizes up.,55656,3
55657,"beautiful dress,too small on the top",55657,3
55659,a little too chunky.,55659,3
55659,it cut my neck while I was wearing it,55659,3
55660,I love these pants but like everyone said they do run small maybe 1 or 2 sizes to small.,55660,3
55660,I did keep mine because I'm losing weight and love them.,55660,3
55661,I bought a large but it was kinda snug around my hips,55661,3
55662,"It's a cute idea, but I had to pull it up to my ribs to make it fit.",55662,3
55662,"I'm a size 14 and 5'6 and it fit ok, but it definitely does not sit on your waist by any means.",55662,3
55662,Bummed because the pic makes it look so cute :(,55662,3
55663,My boyfriend loves it but the zipper broke with in the1st week he got it and i don't think he should have happened so soon .,55663,3
55663,Bad quality but fits good,55663,3
55664,looks good and is exactly as described,55664,3
55666,Color is fantastic but...,55666,3
55666,If you have junk in your trunk and let say that junk is a size 10 get ready cause the XL is barely going to get over your hump and then it'll be baggy around your ankles.,55666,3
55666,For an ugly Christmas sweater party I can rock it.,55666,3
55667,"The rings are super cute, I can't wait to wear them.",55667,3
55667,"My only issue is that the bars are externally threaded, not internally, as described.",55667,3
55667,I should be able to wear them with my healing bars I got from the piercer.,55667,3
55668,"The colors are nice, but the material is too shiny and the crutch cut a bit tight.",55668,3
55668,"I wanted to buy more colors, but won't be doing that.",55668,3
55668,It's more for staying home.,55668,3
55669,"I ordered my usual size, but should have ordered the next size up.",55669,3
55669,"It fits, but I would prefer a looser, more flowy fit.",55669,3
55669,It's a tiny bit tight in the shoulders.,55669,3
55669,"It is very pretty, but the fabric is a bit scratchy at the seams.",55669,3
55670,I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but totally not the color it shows in picture.,55670,3
55670,With that being said I still love it!,55670,3
55670,It arrived without flaws and is beautiful,55670,3
55671,it's too large on me i'm 5'0.,55671,3
55671,the length is too long and drags when i wear it.,55671,3
55671,"it's cute, but not for me.",55671,3
55671,i'll be returning it.,55671,3
55672,"It did not include the instructions on ""How to Shine your Shoes"" that the description said it included",55672,3
55673,The robe is a little big.,55673,3
55674,"Be very wary of what seller you buy the shift from, the seller NEWZSHOP which now shows from China sells an cheap knockoff of original Fender Guitars and Amps Logo T-Shirt Navy Large which initially purchased from Music123 which sells the real Fender T-Shirt,",55674,3
55675,"Almost, but not quite for me.",55675,3
55675,"Im a curvy petite 52, 110 lbs, 32D usually wear an XS or S. Like pretty much everyone else has said, it is extremely cheap fabric (think Halloween cape for the top) and a slightly awkward fit all around.",55675,3
55675,"The top is super thin, and needs to have something under it, but I have no clue what cut of a bra could go under it, and is still a bit too see-through for pasties.",55675,3
55675,"Im keeping it for a while in the hopes Ill find on occasion to wear it, but most likely will end up giving it away further down the line.",55675,3
55675,This is a classic example of you get what you pay for,55675,3
55676,"Perfect, they adjust automatically with the spring out hinges.",55676,3
55676,I will buy again.,55676,3
55677,"good quality but, they felt uneven in the seat area.the leg length was a little long for my taste.",55677,3
55678,It started peeling after the first day,55678,3
55679,The fabric is a little thin.,55679,3
55680,Would be great if it weren't too small.,55680,3
55681,"My son loves these shoes, but with normal wear and tear, they completely wore out within 4 months.",55681,3
55681,Not long enough for my liking.,55681,3
55681,"Cheaply made I'm afraid, but fun while it lasted.",55681,3
55682,Beautiful dress .. the straps were a bit long and didn't really cover me very well .. some double sided tape is needed and the dress is really short ..,55682,3
55683,its pretty but the large size didn't fit me and i'm a US size 6,55683,3
55684,"I typically wear 32"" jeans with a belt and found the 32"" waste to be too small.",55684,3
55684,They taper up towards the waste quite a bit which makes them run small.,55684,3
55685,It gets hot in here.,55685,3
55685,This is a cute top but don't wear it when it's over about 75 or you'll be a hot mess.,55685,3
55686,Ring looks nice but 2 stones fell out within 3 weeks.,55686,3
55687,the dress got a whole in it while I was wearing it :(,55687,3
55688,About what you would expect  for the price.,55688,3
55688,They do a decent job reducing glare.,55688,3
55689,"The slit on the back was too high for my tastes, but overall the dress fit nicely.",55689,3
55690,"the top appears large, unless you have to do extreme push up bra under",55690,3
55691,Headband is too thick and heavy.,55691,3
55693,"Arrived, right on time and in perfect condition.",55693,3
55693,However these particular shoes seem to run slightly smaller then others.,55693,3
55693,"My some wears a 6.5, I ordered a 7 and they fit more like a 6.",55693,3
55694,It's nice but heavy and long!,55694,3
55695,Order this once and it was amazing.,55695,3
55695,Uniformish at a spa.,55695,3
55695,Ordered a second one and it was a completely different fit and stiffer material.,55695,3
55695,Would love to order another one like the first one.,55695,3
55695,But don't know what you're going to get,55695,3
55696,The quality of the belt is cheap.,55696,3
55696,its starting to come apart.,55696,3
55697,"Ride a little high, and a little to big",55697,3
55698,One of the lights started flickering on the same day i got them.,55698,3
55699,A bit upset that it is rusted and noticeable due to it being gold much smaller than I expected it to be!,55699,3
55700,"It is going to serve as a beach cover up, rather than a dress.",55700,3
55701,just order a bigger size I did not read the review and make the mistake  but not again always read the reviews,55701,3
55702,"Great product, wish it came with an instruction guide on how to tie.",55702,3
55702,Took hours on google trying to figure it out!,55702,3
55703,Looks good feels good; can certainly tell they are cheaply made.,55703,3
55703,I will not expect them to last very long although nothing has gone wrong yet.,55703,3
55704,I already starting to rip and I only had it for about two months.,55704,3
55705,I'm about 5'5 and 115 pounds and this was too short.,55705,3
55705,I don't have a long torso but still had to really stretch this to put it on.,55705,3
55707,It seems somewhat old,55707,3
55708,Cheap looking but my teenage step daughter loves them for now,55708,3
55709,"Loved The way it looked, super cute!",55709,3
55709,Just a little smaller than I anticipated,55709,3
55710,"This is such a cute dress, but like other reviews it is too small in the arm holes and bust.",55710,3
55710,I ordered a size larger based on those reviews and should have ordered two sizes larger.,55710,3
55710,it is too bad as it is a unique design.,55710,3
55710,I would question if anyone over a bra cup C could wear this dress.,55710,3
55711,Pretty but really fit too large by a long shot!,55711,3
55712,The top fits perfectly.,55712,3
55712,The bottoms runs small.,55712,3
55714,The waist in the pants is too tight even on my hourglass figure.,55714,3
55714,Otherwise they are fairly soft and comfy.,55714,3
55714,"And fyi, the alligator ones are pink not white.",55714,3
55715,I love the style of the shoe.,55715,3
55715,Good price and it arrived quick.,55715,3
55715,However it came size 1M for little kids and it came twice size one 1M in the box and 13M in the shoe.,55715,3
55715,So I had to return them and get a bigger size.,55715,3
55715,Return was very easy.,55715,3
55717,My husband has muscular arms and the sleeves fit too tight so we have to send it back but otherwise a nice shirt,55717,3
55718,"Not very well made one charm already broke
Cheap metal",55718,3
55719,It's okay as costume jewelry goes.,55719,3
55719,Not high quality but will do.,55719,3
55720,Little flimsy but for the price it's an ok item,55720,3
55721,The workmanship was great.,55721,3
55721,The seller communicated quickly and was very expedient.,55721,3
55721,Was not happy with the applique being on the breast.,55721,3
55721,Had to hire someone to fix it.,55721,3
55722,I am 5 ft 132 lbs.,55722,3
55722,I bought a M/L based on review tips but it's somewhat too large.,55722,3
55722,Didn't get the butt lift maybe it's the size.,55722,3
55723,"I love stars, so I had to get this, but ...",55723,3
55723,The ring that holds the star to the key ring keeps pulling open and the star falls off.,55723,3
55723,I think the metal of the little ring is too week for this application.,55723,3
55723,"I haven't lost the star yet, but pretty disappointed.",55723,3
55723,"Also, the star scratches pretty easily.",55723,3
55724,The picture was of an elbow length veil but the title said cathedral the feature dimensions said it was only 13.8 inches and the description said 36 inches.,55724,3
55724,I thought I would order it to give it a shot.,55724,3
55724,The vail is beautiful but for sure not cathedral length like in the title.,55724,3
55724,"It is a 36"" veil but it is made very well",55724,3
55725,"3 Stars, just because it's too small for me.",55725,3
55725,"I Loved the top, but I think it is more for Teens or really small women.",55725,3
55725,"So was too small for me, a 64 yr old Grandma
.Wish someone would make ""PRETTY CLOTHES"" for older women....just because you're older doesn't mean you don't like ""young"" looking clothes.",55725,3
55726,The necklace did not come with the Tree of Life charm as advertised.,55726,3
55726,I have asked them to send it.,55726,3
55726,"Otherwise, the beads themselves are nice.",55726,3
55727,"It was somewhat small if it was the true size, it would of looked caliente",55727,3
55728,"Happy with the fit, as always (full seat coverage, rise stops about 3"" shy of my belly button, the covered elastic is comfortable and stays in place).",55728,3
55728,I took a star off for durability (I've had some develop small holes within 2-3 washings).,55728,3
55728,"My biggest disappointment was that I didn't receive the color in the photo- apparently ""assorted"" means they'll send you whatever they want.",55728,3
55728,"In my case, this meant basic black/white/nude.",55728,3
55728,"Since I bought these specifically to add colors to my under-wardrobe, this was a pretty big bummer.",55728,3
55729,The jacket was too small...I was really disappointed.,55729,3
55729,"It should have fit, as I followed the size chart!",55729,3
55729,"It's a beautiful jacket, otherwise.",55729,3
55729,I love how soft it is!,55729,3
55730,Cheap Fabric but manageable.,55730,3
55730,The shorts fit perfect the top is a little loose and really thin .,55730,3
55730,its pretty on just wish fabric was a bit more thick,55730,3
55732,"Definitely order a size or two up, they fit very small and they're short waisted.",55732,3
55733,It's a little tighter than I expected.,55733,3
55733,I wear 36x36 of Carhartt's Loose Fit jeans and that fits perfectly.,55733,3
55733,These 36x36 Loose Fit Carpenter pants are a little too tight.,55733,3
55733,I'm not going to return it.,55733,3
55733,I'm planning on getting skinnier anyways.,55733,3
55733,So at least I'll have something to wear then.,55733,3
55734,These run VERY small.,55734,3
55734,"I'm normally a small, and I bought the L/XL.",55734,3
55734,"The material is really thick, but I decided to keep them because I like the shelf bra.",55734,3
55734,No need for me to wear a sports bra under this shirt (I'm small-chested).,55734,3
55735,I wanted a big pack of cheap gloves for my child and that is what was in the box....Kind of...,55735,3
55735,The package was open and inside I found 11 pair of gloves instead of 12.,55735,3
55735,One black pair was soaked in a fluid I'm really hoping was water.,55735,3
55735,This is probably not the fault of the manufacturer.,55735,3
55735,"As for the quality, they are thin, but the kids can still use their hands with the gloves on.",55735,3
55735,With how frequently they lose gloves; these gloves seem to fit the bill.,55735,3
55738,"Beautiful, some way larger than others",55738,3
55739,I love the hat and I love the color.,55739,3
55739,But it is definitely smaller than expected.,55739,3
55739,If you have a somewhat bigger head.,55739,3
55740,Awkward fit...shirt is snug with bigger shoulder area,55740,3
55741,"Good product, but constantly leaving ""fizz"" on my shirts.",55741,3
55742,"I work outdoors on Long Island, NY and need a face mask on the really chilly days.",55742,3
55742,"I hoped this mask would be a good choice, but I returned it.",55742,3
55742,The upper edge leaves too much of my forehead exposed and I don't think it will do the trick after all.,55742,3
55742,It appeared to be well-constructed and of a good quality fleece.,55742,3
55744,My small bag came in damaged I wasn't to pleased by that I due to travel on next Friday and I won't be able to use my bag at all I can't carry it because one of the handles is broke.,55744,3
55745,"Love it but one of the cords came out of the clasp after a few months, so now I'm going to have to see if I can fix it without breaking it more.",55745,3
55747,It's fairly large even after washing and drying it a couple times to try to shrink.,55747,3
55747,My toddler is hard to fit so I was hopeful!,55747,3
55748,I am 5'3 120 lb cup size 36A.,55748,3
55748,I ordered a small and the top is a little large.,55748,3
55748,I do love the look of the suit so I will probably use it regardless of the bad fit.,55748,3
55748,"Additionally, the quality is not the best.",55748,3
55748,The suit I ordered had a lot of loose threads and stitching.,55748,3
55749,"Very cute, great colors, i got a 4 X.",55749,3
55749,Way way too small!,55749,3
55749,Will give it to my daughter.,55749,3
55749,Too bad because it was just what I was looking for.,55749,3
55749,I just cannot figure out these sizes!,55749,3
55749,The other artical came and was large at 2x?,55749,3
55750,Be careful ordering the clothes.,55750,3
55750,They must be designed for petite Asian females.,55750,3
55750,They sizes are not according to US standards.,55750,3
55750,"The clothes and design are gorgeous,  they are just NOT for American women.",55750,3
55751,It's wayyy to small,55751,3
55752,Cute.. Kinda of shiney.,55752,3
55753,Hope I can somehow stretch it to fit,55753,3
55754,"Unless you have perky or perfect shaped boobs, you will need to install an additional strap in the top, so that the bra part doesn't sag.",55754,3
55754,"My boobs are by no means perfect and hang lower than the padding, creating a really odd silouette.",55754,3
55754,"It's fixable, but a design flaw that didn't have different body shapes in mind.",55754,3
55754,There's also this weird roushing that goes down the middle on the butt part.,55754,3
55754,It creates this sagging look.,55754,3
55754,"I'm not sure if I got a size too big or what, but it only looks ok when I pull that part in almost like giving myself a wedgie.",55754,3
55754,I think it's supposed to create a nicer silouette in the backside.,55754,3
55754,I'm hoping washing it will make it shrink up a bit.,55754,3
55754,That or it's ruined forever.,55754,3
55754,I can't return it because I wore it once.,55754,3
55754,It is a damn sexy looking swimsuit and appears as if it can be helped.,55754,3
55754,I will update my review if washing it or adding a strap works out.,55754,3
55755,size was too small.,55755,3
55755,the description led me to  believe it was actually longer,55755,3
55756,I ordered the white version of the dress in a small for a sorority event.,55756,3
55756,I had hesitations after reading reviews online about the quality of ROMWE's clothing.,55756,3
55756,"When it came in, I was expecting the worst, but the dress itself wasn't actually that bad.",55756,3
55756,"There were a few threads that were fraying, which was annoying, and there was absolutely no way the dress could be worn without a slip.",55756,3
55756,"All in all though, it wasn't that bad for how much it cost.",55756,3
55756,"I ended up returning it because I needed it for a specific event and didn't want to pay more for a slip when I could just buy a different white dress, but if you're just buying it for fun, I think it's pretty cute!",55756,3
55756,I think getting it in another color might help as well.,55756,3
55756,"In the white version, it was obvious that the fabric was thin and pretty sheer.",55756,3
55756,I think getting the black version might help avoid that problem.,55756,3
55756,"If you're looking for something cute and inexpensive, ROMWE is the way to go.",55756,3
55756,Just don't expect anything super high quality!,55756,3
55757,this was an alright purchase.,55757,3
55757,it look a very long time to deliver and its not as loose as it is in the picture.,55757,3
55757,"with that said, its still very comfortable and cute.",55757,3
55757,the fabric is very good quality.,55757,3
55757,i got a gray and i was wearing a black bra and you could never tell .,55757,3
55758,It is very cute and comfortable but after less than a week of wear the coating is already beginning to peel and metal underneath paint on the turtle is beginning to show.,55758,3
55758,I'm super bummed because this belly ring is by far the cutest one I've seen.,55758,3
55759,"Good quality fabric and construction, however these run EXTREMELY large.",55759,3
55759,It was swimming on my 19 month old and she is over the 100th percentile for height.,55759,3
55760,"I like it, it is pretty, but it fits kind of weird.",55760,3
55760,"The cut in the pattern is odd, and it looks like you are wearing a wife beater shaped torso with a skirt attached to it.",55760,3
55760,"It is also cut a bit shorter too, something I'll have to get used to.",55760,3
55761,"Super cute, but the measurements for the necklaces are off and there's a lack of quality control in the sizing.",55761,3
55761,"I had to extend the chain in the back to make it fit, even though I measured my neck moments before purchasing.",55761,3
55761,"Disappointed by that, but since I found a way to wear it I still enjoy the necklace.",55761,3
55762,It is comfy and nice but a little smaller than I thought,55762,3
55763,The glue isn't the best.,55763,3
55763,One side didn't stick very well.,55763,3
55763,Wish the glue would work well the next few times too.,55763,3
55764,If you have any boobs they'll not fit in the too and the dress is too long.,55764,3
55765,"I ordered this skirt for my mom's birthday that was a 60's theme, they advertise this skirt as a very long to the floor skirt and is more like a midi skirt since it doesn't go longer than half my legs, good thing is that 60's also was about midi skirts, my sister ended up using it cause even though was cute I was just disappointed at the fact that was not what I was hoping for, good things are that I got ir before expected and that was really cheap.",55765,3
55766,The back is open and it's hard to put on.,55766,3
55767,I ordered a few of these and the construction material was inconsistent.,55767,3
55767,"The white ones came out as cloth ""straps"" while black came out as elastic bands that were much more secure, but prone to fraying.",55767,3
55767,"I really like these, but keeping the padding straight is a bit difficult!",55767,3
55768,Not happy with the quality of the product!,55768,3
55768,I wear an xlg and was told to get a 3x!,55768,3
55768,Glad I did because it fits like an xlg!,55768,3
55769,It's super cute and soft but the opening is too small for it to be a very useful pack.,55769,3
55771,This was a very nice bag but did not come with an insert for the bottom to keep it flat when picking the bag up.,55771,3
55771,When I picked it up everything sank to the center.,55771,3
55771,"Ultimately, I returned it.",55771,3
55772,"Ordered the Large, barely fit me.",55772,3
55773,you need to buy as a minimum a size larger,55773,3
55774,"The it, but it runs large!",55774,3
55775,Cute socks but they didn't even fit my beanpole skinny 11 year old dancer.,55775,3
55776,My son loves these sneakers but the charging cable won't fit into the input on one of  the sneakers.,55776,3
55776,"He's incredibly disappointed about them being ""broken"".",55776,3
55777,It's okay for a casual swimsuit.,55777,3
55777,It is long in the torso and it's hard to keep the cups to stay put.,55777,3
55777,I ordered an XXXXL.,55777,3
55777,"I'm 5'5"" and 190 lbs.",55777,3
55777,Thinking of sending it back for a smaller size.,55777,3
55778,"I bought this adult men's size medium for my 5'1"" 5th grade son and I could barley zip it over his head.",55778,3
55778,I would have expected more wiggle room since it stated it fits up to 5'4''.,55778,3
55778,Besides running small the costume seemed of good quality and design.,55778,3
55779,apparently I have a big head.,55779,3
55779,this is a bit small,55779,3
55780,"Very smally sized, but I was able to give it to my friend and she ADORES it.",55780,3
55780,"Quality cosplay, just be sure to remember it's very small.",55780,3
55780,Order a few sizes larger then what you need.,55780,3
55781,I ordered the BP124-green.,55781,3
55781,This is not a Grace Karin dress or Paul Jones.,55781,3
55781,The tag says it's Belle Pogue and apparently Belle Pogue doesn't care about quality.,55781,3
55781,The black ribbon on the bottom isn't level and neither is the hemline- you can clearly see it in my pictures.,55781,3
55781,"The fabric is cheap, but it's not see-through.",55781,3
55781,The bow in the middle isn't sewn on very well and keeps turning sideways.,55781,3
55781,I'll have to stitch it to keep it in place.,55781,3
55781,"I'm 5'6, size 12, 38D-30-42 and I ordered a Large.",55781,3
55781,"It fits perfectly, but the waist is higher than mine which is a problem I often find and remedy with wide belts.",55781,3
55781,"The dress is ok, but it's not great.",55781,3
55781,I'm not sure how I feel about it and might end up returning it.,55781,3
55781,"The uneven parts stick out like a sore thumb to me, but maybe they won't be as obvious to others.",55781,3
55782,"Wasn't expecting it to be so thin and almost see through..other than that,it is nice..",55782,3
55783,"These are beautiful, but they were larger then I was expecting.",55783,3
55784,"came early, but it came with one of the charms not attached.",55784,3
55784,"When I opened the package, and pulled the bracelet out, one of the charms was off, not too big of a deal I can reattach, but it was missing one of the little rings to attach it... who ever packed it knew it was missing pieces and packed it anyway, disappointing its a cute anklet.",55784,3
55785,Buy a size larger than what you think.,55785,3
55785,It looks really neat in photographs when you use the flash.,55785,3
55785,"The zippers are very high quality, but you get what you pay for.",55785,3
55785,It sells for cheap and worth it for the price.,55785,3
55786,Rhinestones are barely on dress.,55786,3
55786,However the fabric and xolr of dress beautiful.,55786,3
55787,Side pocket was cut and sewn wrong....could not even get a phone in it.,55787,3
55787,Purse was a bit larger than I had imagined.,55787,3
55788,"Pretty, comfy, expect to wear it once because it is incredibly  breakable .",55788,3
55789,Another tie should be added on the left to hold the robe in place and keep it from opening up.,55789,3
55790,Nice top for leggings.,55790,3
55791,Wish that the material hadn't been so see thru .,55791,3
55791,:(  Really liked the style and the fit.,55791,3
55792,Made for a much younger body than mine.,55792,3
55792,Fabric felt good but wrinkled.,55792,3
55793,Very pretty - it looks good on.,55793,3
55793,"The leather is cheap though but for the price, it's nice!",55793,3
55794,I didn't care too much for the material and it looked a little faded,55794,3
55795,Was way to tight in the bust area.,55795,3
55795,I wear a 14/16 bought a size up and it was still tight.,55795,3
55795,Not very happy at all.,55795,3
55795,Probably will not wear it again,55795,3
55796,My 5 year old was excited to see the colors blue and black as the initial picture.,55796,3
55796,We both expected it to be black with blue stitching.,55796,3
55796,Instead it was black with white stitching.,55796,3
55797,"Wish it was longer, came above the knee.",55797,3
55797,"Good quality,  pretty.",55797,3
55799,Material is too stiff.,55799,3
55799,Even after washing it is rough on the skin.,55799,3
55800,Ordered using size guide on Amazon.,55800,3
55800,Item was still too small.,55800,3
55800,Gave away to a friend.,55800,3
55801,"Shirt is a little tight for my wife, got her a small, would have liked to get her a medium but the length is much longer and it would have looked like short dress.",55801,3
55801,"She is 5' 2"" and only about 120 lbs and since the shirt is thin, she needs to wear something under it and it is snug.",55801,3
55802,Doesn't fit as shown.,55802,3
55803,"Very hard to get into, but my friends think its cool",55803,3
55804,They work great for costumes but the fingers did start coming unsewn within a couple hours of wearing.,55804,3
55804,Good in a pinch for the price.,55804,3
55805,They do not fit up to a size 12 very well.,55805,3
55805,They were very see-through and I'm a size 10.,55805,3
55805,Ended up giving them to my size 4 sister.,55805,3
55805,They fit her great!,55805,3
55806,"fits fine, just not for me.",55806,3
55806,made me look ever fatter since there is no waist on this design.,55806,3
55806,"thats not the dresses fault, it's my fault for buying this design but i just wanted to try it out to see.",55806,3
55806,it was a great price so i figured why not give it a try,55806,3
55807,I gave this screen protector three stars because it is a bit narrow for the phone.,55807,3
55807,It does give enough protection against damage to the phone screen but it has gotten some scratches and it does smudge.,55807,3
55808,I purchased this purse because I needed something small with several pockets.,55808,3
55808,"It indeed is small and has 2 pockets in front, 1 in the back, in addition to the main compartment.",55808,3
55808,I purchased this in both the Wham Bam and the Tiny Tuxedo colors.,55808,3
55808,I am returning the Wham Bam as I thought I was getting a red color and it turned out to be more of a orange/pink/peach.,55808,3
55808,It is pretty for perhaps Spring but not the red I was wanting.,55808,3
55808,I am docking 2 stars because the strap chafes against my neck and can be uncomfortable after a little while.,55808,3
55808,A softer strap should be on a purse of this price.,55808,3
55808,I have several cross body purses with softer straps that do not bother me.,55808,3
55808,I am keeping the purse because I like the pockets.,55808,3
55809,Doesn't look like the picture.,55809,3
55810,Are they supposed to feel tight?,55810,3
55810,My toes feel really tight?,55810,3
55810,Can I exchange them?,55810,3
55810,I am a size 9.5 in women.,55810,3
55811,I wear a large.,55811,3
55811,I purchased a xl to wear a sweater underneath.,55811,3
55811,But i gave it to my daughter.,55811,3
55811,The size is misleading.,55811,3
55811,But the  coat is nice my daughter said it is really warm.,55811,3
55812,The picture does not look like the product.,55812,3
55812,There was no red on the purse--it was all black and white.,55812,3
55812,It is much bigger than pictures.,55812,3
55813,It's cute but the arms are tight.,55813,3
55813,Not as loose as the picture.,55813,3
55813,Would recommend buying a size up then washing it.,55813,3
55814,They where smaller than the picture reveals...,55814,3
55815,Very nice but plastic is thin.,55815,3
55815,Be gentle I guess.,55815,3
55817,A more 'formal' pair of shorts than I expected.,55817,3
55818,I'm tiny so it's a little big on me,55818,3
55819,Fabric doesn't have much give.,55819,3
55819,I thought it would be softer.,55819,3
55820,Costume was missing headband.,55820,3
55820,Can you just reship that piece without the hassle of a return?,55820,3
55821,Kinda bulky but tight at the same time.,55821,3
55821,Does that make sense?,55821,3
55821,I think this is a good shirt if you're at a Caribbean beach resort and you just want to relax by the pool.,55821,3
55821,You won't be a girl magnet but you won't scare them away.,55821,3
55822,Really like these sunglass but I wish they came in wider sizes.,55822,3
55823,PXS ordered the 4 in green and it fits.,55823,3
55823,Maybe 2 would fit better.,55823,3
55823,The green color is bright and lovely!,55823,3
55823,"My biggest beef with this shirt is the silly shoulder thing they did, which does not look nice as in the photo here.",55823,3
55823,It just doesn't lay flat and makes my shoulders look 80s big.,55823,3
55824,"The jacket meets my basic standards, but there's definitely some room for improvement quality-wise.",55824,3
55824,"The ribbed cotton fabric at the waist, wrists, and neck, is a bit too ""loose"" feeling.",55824,3
55824,"Some more elastic would definitely help these spots, as I feel that these bits of the jacket should feel more snug than they do.",55824,3
55824,"The zipper on the jacket is also of low quality, resulting in a bit of a struggle when I try to zip the jacket up.",55824,3
55824,"Finally, the fit is a bit off for me--but that could be more of a problem due to my size.",55824,3
55824,I'm 6'2 and about 165 lbs.,55824,3
55824,(a fairly slim guy.,55824,3
55824,"The jacket definitely meets the slim fit I'm looking for, but unfortunately the arms are a bit too short for my arms, resulting in the jacket arms creeping back fairly often when I extend my arms.",55824,3
55824,"If you're interested in this sort of jacket, and need to buy one on a budget--this one should fit the bill.",55824,3
55824,"But if you're willing to throw in the 30-40 bucks that most jackets of this style require, I'd recommend you do that.",55824,3
55825,"The top is cute, but much shorter than the picture portrays.",55825,3
55825,"The company quickly refunded my money when they read that I was dissatisfied, though.",55825,3
55826,"It's a beautiful dress, super flowy!",55826,3
55826,I wore it ONCE and the strap broke!!!,55826,3
55826,I am so mad!,55826,3
55826,"So three stars, because it's pretty.",55826,3
55828,It is a very light rain jacket.,55828,3
55829,"Honestly, I only wore this a few times - mainly because I started showing early, and was soon out of my regular clothing and into maternity.",55829,3
55829,"Maternity pants have their own attached band, and it's actually more comfortable than wearing a separate one over regular pants.",55829,3
55829,"I think the belly band is best utilized during that transition stage when your pants are starting to get tight, but you're not quite ready for maternity.",55829,3
55829,But I don't think it's worth using it to try and stay in regular pants throughout pregnancy - the comfort level of actual maternity pants is just so much higher.,55829,3
55830,The chain broke within the first week.,55830,3
55831,"Size is not exactly correct, if you need a roomy blouse buy the next size up.",55831,3
55831,"The blue blouse fades and bleeds, do not wash with lighter colors.",55831,3
55831,"Also very thin fabric, you will need to wear a cami under.",55831,3
55832,Pants are too large.,55832,3
55833,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it,  it's smaller than i expected.",55833,3
55834,Cheaply made and very light weight,55834,3
55835,"Great quality and color, just wish it came in a larger size.",55835,3
55835,Had to return as my mother-in-law smokes 100s.,55835,3
55836,These would be great for shorter more chubby babies.,55836,3
55836,"For my little boy who is in the 50% for weight and 75% for height, it is so baggy on him and not really long enough.",55836,3
55836,They are nice and soft though.,55836,3
55837,As for the material and style it is great.,55837,3
55837,But when you order a size L and it feels like size S is disappointing.,55837,3
55837,Fortunately I have a daughter who now wears it all the time.,55837,3
55838,"Beautiful necklace,  Shipping was very fast.",55838,3
55838,Packaging was very thoughtful.,55838,3
55838,Can't wait to wear it.,55838,3
55838,I am going to look Fabulous.,55838,3
55839,returned them as way too big for my face!,55839,3
55839,but they do say oversized,55839,3
55840,Com with different look,55840,3
55842,Cozy but color is a little off.,55842,3
55842,Not very flattering but may look better on someone less curvaceous.,55842,3
55843,I ordered these because my son is obsessed with baseball and wasn't too jazzed about the idea of big boy underpants.,55843,3
55843,I thought having underpants with baseball on them would help.,55843,3
55843,None of the underwear I got had baseball anything on them.,55843,3
55843,Mostly just Elmo and a little cookie monster.,55843,3
55843,"They do the job, and they're good quality but it's not what I wanted.",55843,3
55844,It does look like leather.,55844,3
55844,The purse feels like leather to.,55844,3
55844,"I even like the color But

I do not like the straps as they are not staying on my shoulder and then the name
is so cheap making the purse look like a $25 bag",55844,3
55845,I returned because there was a black line across the leg.,55845,3
55845,Didn't get another pair but they would have been o.k.,55845,3
55846,"This tank is a half tank, which I did not realize.",55846,3
55847,My son loves the look of the watch but it will not hold the time.,55847,3
55847,It runs too fast.,55847,3
55847,He has to reset the time everyday.,55847,3
55847,By morning it's 2 hours ahead.,55847,3
55847,Ps the instructions that come with it are in Chinese.,55847,3
55847,He had to Google how to fix the time.,55847,3
55849,I ordered a smaller size but it is large too but doesn't contain the girls.,55849,3
55851,Shorts look great but sizes are a little off.,55851,3
55851,I ordered the size my child normally wears but they are a little short and tight.,55851,3
55852,The straps provide little to no support.,55852,3
55852,"However, the boyfriend enjoys it!",55852,3
55853,i bought this shirt for my mother it is correct size my but we like material cause its cotton but it did say it was chiffon which is plus in my books.,55853,3
55853,only issue i have it came with holes underneath armhole and another slight to back of armhole and way it was  fit with cut out on sleeve is not by elbow.,55853,3
55853,other than that i give it 3.,55853,3
55854,"Love it just be careful with the shield, it easily scratches",55854,3
55855,"It's cute and my daughter loves it, but she will on be able to wear it for a few months.",55855,3
55855,"I got a 5-6 and it's fits, just wish it was a little bigger!",55855,3
55855,"Also doesn't seem to be as bright as in the picture, colors are a little dull!",55855,3
55856,"Too big to be a cigarette holder, too small for sunglasses, not sure what I am going to do with it.",55856,3
55856,"I love the rubbery feel of the material and the color, but not sure what I'm going to use it for.",55856,3
55857,Doesn't fit very well.,55857,3
55857,Keep falling off my son's hands.,55857,3
55859,It was to big up top!,55859,3
55860,Just not my style!,55860,3
55860,The lace is not as soft and gentle as I thought it would be.,55860,3
55860,I suppose it's just too young a style than I should be wearing..,55860,3
55860,"It's a nice blouse, other than the lace is
Not as soft as I felt it should/would be the blouse is soft and fits well.",55860,3
55861,"I really wanted to like these yoga pants, especially because the colors shown online look super vibrant and sexy; however, in person the purple part on these pants is really just thin stripes, and definitely doesn't look the way the picture does.",55861,3
55861,"Additionally, I'm always a small (4/6) in pants, but I couldn't get these on all the way.",55861,3
55861,I was really afraid of ripping them if I tried any harder than I already did.,55861,3
55861,I almost ordered a size up but the truth is they just don't look as cute as I'd hoped and I'd rather put the money toward a pair I can love.,55861,3
55863,"I adore the style, but the design does have its limitations: there are no buttonholes, and the cross-straps have no buttons at all.",55863,3
55863,"The buttons are attached with elastic, and the cross-straps have elastic at one end.",55863,3
55863,"Even so, I had a little trouble getting these on my average-width foot, but once I did, the straps were loose and floppy, so they're going back - boohoo!",55863,3
55864,Decent for what I needed them for but one was really loose and the top dropped to the carpet to be gone forever.,55864,3
55865,cute...well made but runs small,55865,3
55866,It was super cute and well made.,55866,3
55866,"However, the bottom is a bit too high cut.",55866,3
55866,If you are a mom and don't want your cheeks out don't order this one.,55866,3
55867,"I ordered a medium but fits tight on my body, it is beautiful I wish the seller will make more this dresses in bigger size.",55867,3
55868,"text print quality is not good, but its pretty comfortable to wear.",55868,3
55869,I really like the fabric and the style but it is cut way too small.,55869,3
55869,I went by the measurements given (Asian) but still too small.,55869,3
55869,Check your measurements and buy the size larger.,55869,3
55869,Would love to be able to wear it.,55869,3
55870,A little too tight,55870,3
55871,it's just solid fabric in the back,55871,3
55872,it's really nice but HUGE,55872,3
55874,These rings are very well made and I like the style.,55874,3
55874,"However, I cannot make them a smaller size as they are very large.",55874,3
55875,The shirt was pretty and looked like the picture but the shirt runs very small.,55875,3
55875,"It is tight around the arms, bust and the bottom of the shirt.",55875,3
55875,"Normally I am a large or an extra large, but not for this product.",55875,3
55876,Looked great for the price but the cross broke off a week later,55876,3
55877,Top fit was ok but bottom was way to small !,55877,3
55877,The lining in the inside is white which looks weird once it's tied if u have small boobs like me top will be perfect but if u have a big bottom it will be to small,55877,3
55878,Quality is okay for price.,55878,3
55878,"The bust was a little short in terms of vertical proportions(waist to shoulders), shoulders a little narrow across.",55878,3
55878,Im 5' 10 168 lbs,55878,3
55879,Beautiful and well made but fits very tight/small eve though I ordered a size larger than I am.,55879,3
55880,"I would have like to give these product more stars, but it runs smaller than expected.",55880,3
55880,"I also had to was it before I wore it around my newborn, and it was even smaller.",55880,3
55881,Follow the size guidelines - they are accurate.,55881,3
55881,"The only problem I had with this is I didn't consider how much more heat it would hold in, and in the middle of the summer, I was roasting with this on.",55881,3
55882,I liked the color but the material was too thin.,55882,3
55882,The dress felt and looked cheap and it was not flattering on me.,55882,3
55882,"If I had paid less for it I might have kept it, but for the price it had to go back.",55882,3
55883,I need to wear a camisole under this and a sweater over it in order to not be overly exposed.,55883,3
55884,Was for a costume.,55884,3
55885,They are much bigger than I thought and they didn't come w backings,55885,3
55886,"Really small, I was disappointed in the size.",55886,3
55886,The print is awesome but it's literally like a lunchbox in size.,55886,3
55887,"Nice look, seems sturdy.",55887,3
55887,I was looking for a bag for daily trips to the gym and this appeared to be the right size but it's a bit small and zipper open only across the top; it doesn't continue down the ends so when I can't open the bag as wide as I'd like to see what's inside.,55887,3
55887,"Not a big deal, just an annoyance.",55887,3
55887,I would prefer something a bit bigger to comfortably fit all of my gym stuff and with a zipper that opens all the way down the ends but this will do.,55887,3
55888,Its really soft and the design is cool.,55888,3
55888,I knew this was going to be smaller than I expected so I ordered an extra large to be sure it would fit.,55888,3
55888,The actual size of this sweater is more like a medium.,55888,3
55888,I'm convinced the only difference is the sticker they put on it.,55888,3
55889,Smaller than expected I purchased for my wife but fits my 9 year old daughter,55889,3
55891,It looks lovely - but it's too small and the lightweight fabric would show every single extra pound and bulge.,55891,3
55891,I can't wear it - but I'm not going to return it.,55891,3
55891,I'm going to pass it on to some sweet young thing who will wear and look like a million dollars!,55891,3
55892,The circle on the shirt isn't a circle.,55892,3
55892,It's more of an oval.,55892,3
55892,& the whole outfit is much larger than 0-6 months.,55892,3
55895,"Only get for girls, there is glitter on the symbol!",55895,3
55895,"My sister didn't get the memo of ""Wonder woman"" socks and bought them for me.",55895,3
55895,I appreciate them but the glitter is kinda embarrassing.,55895,3
55896,So I order it in a size to fit my 9 yr old daughter...,55896,3
55897,Hard to tell time at a moments notice without having to do the math!,55897,3
55898,Material is a little too thick for me.,55898,3
55900,Did not look like the picture.,55900,3
55900,Youwill need to cut it into that style.,55900,3
55901,Baggy and somewhat small on my legs,55901,3
55902,Shirt was a little too small and too short.,55902,3
55903,Well-made but really small.,55903,3
55903,"I like longer shorts, and have trouble finding something I like in women's clothes, so I sometimes buy men's.",55903,3
55903,I ordered medium and they fit but are pretty snug.,55903,3
55903,"Many times linen stretches, but these are more heavy duty then what I am used to, so they are not stretching as I expected.",55903,3
55903,These are not going to fit most men.,55903,3
55903,"I wear a 6 in women's, a 26-28 in men's and can wear a boys 14 husky in Wrangler cargo shorts.",55903,3
55903,The price is decent enough that I may try a large for a better fit.,55903,3
55903,I should also add that I ordered dark grey and the color is more of a dark blue which was disappointing.,55903,3
55903,I am 5'7 and the short hit in the middle of my knee.,55903,3
55904,It's cute be it's for a really thin body type.,55904,3
55905,It was too small to put anything under it.,55905,3
55905,Needed a bigger size so I returned it.,55905,3
55905,I am a 14 and I got a XL and it just had no room for a sweater,55905,3
55907,As you can see by the picture there is a difference in color.,55907,3
55907,Please stop using Apple's photos to advertise your bands.,55907,3
55907,It would be better for the consumer to see the actual band you're selling.,55907,3
55907,There's nothing wrong with your bands except for the color difference.,55907,3
55907,The band works very well.,55907,3
55907,It does attract lint and hair like crazy though.,55907,3
55907,The band is slightly thinner than the actual apple brand.,55907,3
55907,I ended up buy Apple's version because I really like the bright green.,55907,3
55907,I still like your band.,55907,3
55907,I just wish your company would not mislead consumers.,55907,3
55908,"Beautiful robe, very sexy and nice material however runs extremely small for a large and still too small for me... for those with curves please go up a size or two!",55908,3
55909,"I liked the look, but it runs very small.",55909,3
55909,Order up 1-2 sizes.,55909,3
55910,Runs a little small and short,55910,3
55911,"The necklaces are so cute, but I wasn't given the right infinity sign necklace and I was a little disappointed I was given a plain one.",55911,3
55911,Overall I love them!,55911,3
55912,"Cute dress, love the material, but runs very very small - at least two sizes too small.",55912,3
55912,"And for that reason, I gave it 3 starts.",55912,3
55914,It was advertised as a sweater but is made out very light weight material ..I can't really wear it until Spring.,55914,3
55915,"The pin bent the first time I used it, should be sturdier.",55915,3
55917,Cute dress....but did fit a little on the big side.,55917,3
55917,Length was alright...but the bodice was a bit too roomy!,55917,3
55917,Still like it and enjoy wearing it.,55917,3
55918,BROKE AFTER 2 WEEKS,55918,3
55919,The dress looks great and I love how they feel.,55919,3
55919,I bought two of these dresses in separate sizes for my flower girls.,55919,3
55919,A size 8 and a size 12.,55919,3
55919,My only problem with the dresses is that they were too big.,55919,3
55919,The size 12 was only slightly off in size.,55919,3
55919,The size 8 was way off and I will have to try and get it taken in so that my daughter can wear it for the wedding.,55919,3
55920,"Very pretty, and they work alright for their purpose so far.",55920,3
55920,"Though, do be careful with them and use lots of extra lubricant cos if you're rough with them they WILL break!",55920,3
55921,I like the fit and design.,55921,3
55921,Thinner material than expected  and I'm not sure if the design will stay on without peeling off.,55921,3
55921,We ll see after I  wash it a couple of times,55921,3
55923,This is super cute.,55923,3
55923,I got this for my boyfriend who is a musician and I thought this would be perfect to add to gift but place it in the card.,55923,3
55923,I'm not a musician or know much about music so I rated this as 3/5 stars because I'm not sure if the quality is THAT great.,55923,3
55923,I kinda doubt  that it is.,55923,3
55924,About what I expected.,55924,3
55925,These are nice and great detail for the price.,55925,3
55926,Shoulder seam broke after four washes,55926,3
55927,I like the waterproof factor.,55927,3
55927,I like the way it looks also.,55927,3
55927,I don't like the fact that the buckles come loose quite a bit and that is annoying.,55927,3
55927,I am a female and it looks great for male or female.,55927,3
55927,"I use it for day to day things, computers, books, gym clothes.",55927,3
55928,Looks very nice initially and fits well.,55928,3
55928,"However, the leather is very thin and wears quickly.",55928,3
55928,I have worn this for about 3 months and am already looking for a new belt due to the wear on this one.,55928,3
55929,"I bought two different styles/  this one is to large and the other one is nothing like the color in the picture,  but it  is a great fit!!",55929,3
55929,THEY STATE THAT  ONE SIZE FITS ALL!,55929,3
55929,I DON'T THINK SO!,55929,3
55929,PICTURE IS NOT  THE SAME COLOR OR STYLE.,55929,3
55931,A little cheap looking.,55931,3
55932,It is a pretty dress.,55932,3
55932,I wish it came in a size bigger.,55932,3
55932,the large fit more like a medium.,55932,3
55932,"I usually wear a size 10, and the large was a little fitted around the back.",55932,3
55934,The top part of the dress was a little big.,55934,3
55934,"I gave exact measurements, but it was still wearable.",55934,3
55935,Only because the supper was defective had to get a new one out in all really spent more than u should have for this  outfit.,55935,3
55935,But the fit was perfect,55935,3
55936,I didn't like the desing once i tried them on,55936,3
55937,Beautiful dress the only thing its to big at the top and small at the waist for the size.,55937,3
55938,This shirt fits strange in the shoulder/arm area.,55938,3
55938,It has excess material at the back of the shoulders and the sleeves are a tad short and way to tight.,55938,3
55938,I have broad shoulders so for there to be excess material at back of shoulders is very unusual.,55938,3
55938,I like the color of the shirt and the graphic on the shirt.,55938,3
55938,They are spot on as depicted in the pictures,55938,3
55939,"Okay, I missed a chance to return it and donating it.",55939,3
55939,Its a little cheap looking.,55939,3
55939,The blue is actually part of the dress and not a separate piece.,55939,3
55940,It fits wonderfully and I love the way it looks.,55940,3
55940,Unfortunately it has a small rip in it and I'm devastated because I received it the evening before my trip out of the country.,55940,3
55940,I would purchase this again but now I know what to look for before taking it with me on vacation.,55940,3
55940,"Pros:beautifully designed, fit perfectly I'm a 16/18 and 5'9,  accentuates my shape
Cons: thin material, shipped off defective with a small tear",55940,3
55941,This was an OK bracelet for the money however the chakra colors red and orange are not exactly accurate as they are both red.,55941,3
55941,Also the clear beads on the opposite side are extremely annoying and get in the way.,55941,3
55941,Adjusting the bracelet while on is very difficult,55941,3
55942,One of the gems was missing from the bracelet.,55942,3
55942,"I ordered 2, one was perfect and the other was not.",55942,3
55944,"It's sheer, it's thin and it will show all the areas you don't want to be seen.",55944,3
55944,I usually wear a 18-20 I bought the 5x based on reviews and it does fit like an 18.,55944,3
55944,It looked perfect on me standing but when u sit it reveals all your midsection.,55944,3
55945,The colors and materials are really good and the waist size fit as expected but the leg openings are enormous for the XL.,55945,3
55945,"I'm 6'4"" 240lb and could probably fit both of my legs through one leg opening.",55945,3
55945,I don't notice it most of the time but when sleeping in them the openings will bunch up a good bit.,55945,3
55946,Still cute but shorter than I expected,55946,3
55947,"I was disappointed in the fit of these, but they are lovely to look at, and would be great if they fit.",55947,3
55948,These outfits were absolutely adorable.,55948,3
55948,Unfortunately one of the snaps fell off one of the outfits within the first hour of my son wearing it.,55948,3
55948,My son is 6 months approx 24 inches and 18lbs.,55948,3
55948,I did love the way they looked and fit.,55948,3
55948,But because of the poor quality of the snaps I can't give it the 5 stars I want to.,55948,3
55948,I am considering buying again to give them a second chance just because they are so cute.,55948,3
55949,"Great belt, the sizing is a little small, so I'd got 2-4 inches over your actual waste size.",55949,3
55950,It gets worn-out easily.,55950,3
55950,The gold fades away to a silver color and you can see the glue where it's put together.,55950,3
55950,Also gets kinda copper red is and rust a bit on the part that's howling the stone.,55950,3
55950,I got them a few months ago and my boyfriend stopped wearing his because it made his neck turn green,55950,3
55951,The size Large runs small.,55951,3
55951,I normally wear a Large.,55951,3
55951,I'm a size 12.,55951,3
55951,Feels more like a Medium.,55951,3
55951,"Great quality material, screen printed design.",55951,3
55952,Very costly for a child's slipper.,55952,3
55954,I love these jeans but they run a bit large,55954,3
55955,The cups are shaped weird... but it probably works better with larger bust.,55955,3
55955,The back horizontal straps are spread apart.,55955,3
55956,Mine broke within a couple of months,55956,3
55957,"Loved this jacket so much, but had to send it back.",55957,3
55957,"I usually wear a small, but this was very tight.",55957,3
55957,"Unfortunately, it is only offered in sizes  extra small and small.",55957,3
55957,Medium would have worked.,55957,3
55958,Thinner than I expected bit the right size,55958,3
55959,Nice but I wanted the one with the belt loops.,55959,3
55960,I don't like the fact that it is losing it's luster after only 2 weeks.,55960,3
55960,Jewelry cleaner does not help.,55960,3
55960,It also slipped off my neck due to the design.,55960,3
55960,I still love it & will try find to a way to clean it.,55960,3
55961,Cute but a few of the large beads have fallen out,55961,3
55962,"This is a beautiful belly ring, however the middle piece fell off about a week into wearing it.",55962,3
55963,I bought a larger size figuring it would shrink and it did.,55963,3
55963,It shrunk lengthwise but not a lot on the sides so I have some tailoring to do.,55963,3
55963,The graphics are good quality!,55963,3
55964,Pretty but fringe gets tangled,55964,3
55965,Great quality but they all fit slightly different.,55965,3
55965,Some fit perfect and others too tight.,55965,3
55965,I ought a few pairs.,55965,3
55966,This swimsuit is beautiful however you have constantly  adjust the bra cups/inserts.,55966,3
55967,I love it but I don't like the material,55967,3
55968,It's beautiful but much smaller than I expected,55968,3
55969,This is very short.,55969,3
55969,"The model in the picture must be short, because this ""dress"" is more of a tunic on me.",55969,3
55970,"Good quality, top fit perfectly, the bottom little small.",55970,3
55971,Very nice and comfortable,55971,3
55972,"Would have looked better shaped, a little form fitted, (or I was 'smaller'!)",55972,3
55973,I bought this hoping it would be a really good doormat quality wise.,55973,3
55973,I do love the design because I love tool.,55973,3
55973,"Unfortunately, it is extremely thin and small in size.",55973,3
55973,I did find purpose for it though as I am actually using it as a bath mat instead.,55973,3
55973,The way it's made reminds me of the cheap $10 bath mats you can buy at Walmart.,55973,3
55973,At least it's soft on my bare feet!,55973,3
55973,"I'm still glad I purchased it because I do like it, just wish it was a little larger and thicker.",55973,3
55974,"not the color as pictured, the material is a thin knit not a sweater material the color is more of a yellow cream color not at all like pictured",55974,3
55975,"Thetop fit bigger than expected and if you expect to get the color shown in the picture, it will be like a purplish color.",55975,3
55976,I  love it,55976,3
55977,Should have metal rings for neck strap,55977,3
55978,Pants are way to big and look nothing like the picture.,55978,3
55978,A little disappointed  I figured there would be a little difference from the picture there usually is but they don't even come close and the pants are way to big.,55978,3
55978,Shirt fits fine again similar to the picture but not the same,55978,3
55979,I fit nicely and was very comfortable.,55979,3
55979,the only issue what that i have long legs and it was an inch above my ankles at the bottom so i have to wear them cuffed when without shoes that cover the bottom.,55979,3
55979,"other than the length being a bit short and not looking exactly like the picture, they're good for the price.",55979,3
55980,It was smaller than the size shown in size chart.,55980,3
55982,The material is a cheaper fabric than I expected.,55982,3
55983,somewhat too small and see thru.,55983,3
55984,love the shirt but the size is a bit smaller than what you would think.,55984,3
55984,wrist are small and arm length is shorter than expected.,55984,3
55984,I am only 5' 5'' so that is surprising.,55984,3
55985,I wore this dress at an Army formal event for my boyfriend's unit and I received a lot of compliments.,55985,3
55985,The only complaints I had was that the zipper got stuck zipping it up and I was scared that I was going to damage the zipper and I wouldn't be able to wear at the event.,55985,3
55985,The other thing that was more important to me was the quality of the sheer material.,55985,3
55985,"As pictured it looks like the material is much stiffer giving the wearer a fuller effect and to me a more glamorous look, but when I opened the package that wasn't the case.",55985,3
55985,It was a thin almost fragile sheer that just hung loosely and didn't have no form to it.,55985,3
55985,"I still wore the dress though since it was last minute and my boyfriend liked it, but if I had time I would have exchanged the dress.",55985,3
55986,The floral print I've received is not the same with the picture and the size is somewhat small.,55986,3
55986,"I bought medium but it fits like small, the floral print I've got looks OK but I honestly would prefer the one shown in the picture.",55986,3
55987,I love the print!,55987,3
55987,"However, the shirt is extremely small!",55987,3
55987,I had read that it ran small so I ordered a medium.,55987,3
55987,"I am 5' 8"" and it is basically a belly shirt and pretty tight.",55987,3
55987,Definitely does not fit the way the picture shows!,55987,3
55988,it is a size large but it is made larger than he normally wears...the fabric is great I love the feel of it,55988,3
55989,Cute earings but they are definitely smaller than in the picture.,55989,3
55990,It's an ok pjs.,55990,3
55990,It is small so order one size up for comfort.,55990,3
55990,The fabric is not the best and after frequent washing it is just not the same,55990,3
55991,looks goofy on me,55991,3
55992,It's super cute but really undersized.,55992,3
55992,I typically wear a large and had to order an xxl but that did fit.,55992,3
55992,The snap makes it lay funny so I removed it and added a button.,55992,3
55992,For the price if you size up it's a good purchase,55992,3
55993,Doesn't latch closed well as it only has a small pin on the back of the buckle.,55993,3
55994,"I am around 130 lbs, 5'7 and my bra size is about a 36C...I got a medium because I was nervous that it would be too big.",55994,3
55994,I was a little disappointed to see that the suit was actually a little small and the top didn't offer the best support.,55994,3
55994,"It's a nice made suit, but I will probably end up giving it to my smaller sister.",55994,3
55995,Some of the rhinestones were gone when they arrived.,55995,3
55995,Forgot and ended up keeping them.,55995,3
55996,"I always wear a 31x34 Levi 505, which is what I ordered.",55996,3
55996,They were way too long.,55996,3
55996,"I tried washing them since they're 100% cotton and they did shrink length-wise, but are still a good 2"" longer than my Levi's.",55996,3
55996,They are also definitely baggy.,55996,3
55997,"Fit on the waist perfectly but the built in swim bottom digs in around the tops of my legs, which creates a bumpy look on the skirt I kept it and will wear it but unfortunately will be on the look out for a better one",55997,3
55998,"Super cute, lightweight sweatshirt.",55998,3
55998,Too bad ran WAY TOO small.... Had to return it.,55998,3
55999,Modifiying it to a racerback so it fits better.,55999,3
55999,"The fabric is very sheer, you have to have undergarments.",55999,3
56000,These fit nice and had a comfortable lining.,56000,3
56000,They reminded me of crocs because they were nice and light.,56000,3
56000,"We ended up returning, however, because the bottom of the shoes didn't have much tread to grip snow, and I didn't want my son to be slipping all over the place with these.",56000,3
56001,A little too big for me and the strap is too long,56001,3
56002,"The sizes are way off, but the dress overall is beautiful and seems to be well made.",56002,3
56003,Really nice quality coat.,56003,3
56003,The only problem I have with it is that it's bigger than I'd hoped.,56003,3
56003,I'm a medium everything and medium size is actually really big on me.,56003,3
56004,ordered a XL still too small,56004,3
56006,Quality was good color was good.,56006,3
56006,Fit a little narrow.,56006,3
56008,"The dress is lovely, the length is perfect for my 5""8 and and flows well and wide, and  the colors are as shown in the picture.",56008,3
56008,"However, looking at the front side,  the dress seems uneven and the design is weird.",56008,3
56008,"I had to measure each side, lay the dress flat, and wear it several times to try to understand what is going on, because I thought it was my shape that was not right for it.",56008,3
56008,"The left side is cut square and it is longer than the right side, which is cut kind of round.",56008,3
56008,"Not only is the left quare but it is longer, and to me it is way too long compared to the other side.",56008,3
56008,"It looks like I am wearing the dress with one foot on heel and the other on flat shoes, and it is really botheingn me.",56008,3
56008,"I wish they had rounded both sides of left them squere, or either make sure that one covers well the other.",56008,3
56008,That is my only dissapointment and I cannot say if it is major or not.,56008,3
56008,I am using a pin to try to level the dress and I will see if I need to get it altered to fix this.,56008,3
56008,"Other than that, I love it!",56008,3
56009,The shoes are indeed cute & comfortable however it is falling apart and I just got it.,56009,3
56009,The toe part is lifting up.,56009,3
56010,Not very happy with this product the cane is a lovely cane arrived on time but without the time piece not sure what went wrong but I'm not too happy as this was a present for my dad,56010,3
56011,"I really, really like the watch a lot however the quality of the band is a little to be desired.",56011,3
56011,The rubber part where the band is held in place broke about 2 months after it was purchased.,56011,3
56011,"Truly a nice looking watch, but for 13$ it's about what I'd expect.",56011,3
56012,Cute dress...it's designed for someone with a longer torso!,56012,3
56013,To small shorter than what I wanted,56013,3
56014,Does not look like the picture at all.,56014,3
56014,"It's comfortable, just that the cuts made it seem really cheap and amateurly DIY'd.",56014,3
56014,Returned ~ 3/5 stars,56014,3
56015,The sizes are very inaccurate and too large.,56015,3
56015,I would go at least 2 sizes smaller than you think you need,56015,3
56016,"listed as a 1x, but it only measures 10"" and 13"" stretched!",56016,3
56016,It would have fit me when I was 12 yrs old.,56016,3
56016,padded cup is very small cup size.,56016,3
56016,"It is very well made, but the sizing is very wrong, I would need to sew 2 of them together!",56016,3
56016,Seller did ship quickly.,56016,3
56017,They were a little too short for me.,56017,3
56018,I like it a lot but it was a little small but I like it...,56018,3
56020,beautiful design but the inside fabrics rips easily,56020,3
56021,These tights are not for people with double digit sizes or hips.,56021,3
56021,"After a few adjustments and limited time, I just cut them into stockings.",56021,3
56021,I wish they were more true to the sizing chart because I am a size 10 and these still did not fit comfortably.,56021,3
56021,Maybe mine were just a bad batch.,56021,3
56022,Get too big after a couple of hours wear but the material feels so nice,56022,3
56023,So...I love the print of the suit....however..I ordered a medium because the reviews said to order up ( I am usually a small).,56023,3
56023,The top is too big and the bottoms are a tad snug.,56023,3
56023,"For the price I am not going to return it, I am going to see if I can alter the top and just buy different bottoms",56023,3
56024,Pretty dress but size Medium was a little too big on me..,56024,3
56025,It's a nice cover just turned out.,56025,3
56025,Ot to be what I was looking for.,56025,3
56026,It's a great belt but after wearing it for a while the back seems to be losing its grip and slips and the buckle comes loose.,56026,3
56026,It was great for the first few months of use.,56026,3
56027,I just ordered this and a few days later it went on sale for $15.00 less.,56027,3
56027,Fabric is not 100% cotton but lightweight.,56027,3
56028,"The plastic tunnels break so easily, but the tapers seem to be holding up well.",56028,3
56028,"Cheap, but works in a pinch I suppose",56028,3
56029,Material is nice but they run too small.,56029,3
56029,I ordered 12 month an that's a small to them.,56029,3
56029,My son is super small for his age (0.01%) an they were too tight an short on him.,56029,3
56030,"too small for my legs.. cuts into my thighs, made for small people but the product shipped fast and good quality",56030,3
56031,"Cute, I wish the soles were more substantial.",56031,3
56031,"They are for a 7 year old kid, she'll probably wear through the soles quickly.",56031,3
56031,But she loves them.,56031,3
56032,I read the reviews before I bought this jacket.,56032,3
56032,Several said that this jacket was fitted and that it would be a good idea to order a size up.,56032,3
56032,I did so and am sorry that I did that.,56032,3
56032,The jacket is sized normally and people should order their regular size.,56032,3
56032,I need to return the one that I ordered because it is much too large for me.,56032,3
56033,"picture looks pink but they are coral, dark coral.",56033,3
56034,My wife likes it,56034,3
56035,These crocs are really cozy !,56035,3
56035,My son has high instep thats why they fit a little bit small.,56035,3
56037,Ok but too large,56037,3
56038,Decal on this shirt was blurry in person.,56038,3
56038,It is an iron on.,56038,3
56038,It seems homemade not professionally made shirt.,56038,3
56038,Three stars because I was given a full refund including shipping.,56038,3
56039,It is not what I expected and in the pics it looks like it has a handle.,56039,3
56039,It will work for what I was going to use it for but still looking for something else.,56039,3
56040,I have had it for about six months and have been wearing it everyday.,56040,3
56040,It has gotten darker but not by too much.,56040,3
56040,Its not brown but just a darker tint.,56040,3
56041,It's a really cute shirt but the XL fits exactly like a small.,56041,3
56041,I normally wear a medium but wanted to be sure that it fit so I ordered larger.,56041,3
56042,I gave this a four star rating because it runs small.,56042,3
56042,My engagement ring is.,56042,3
56042,6 1/2 and I ordered the 7 in this and it's slightly smaller than that ring.,56042,3
56042,My fianc ordered the 11 1/2 which is his correct size and it was too small.,56042,3
56042,He reordered it in a 12 and it's still on the snug side.,56042,3
56042,"It's otherwise nice, although too dark to match my white gold engagement ring, more like an old nickel in color.",56042,3
56042,However the finish is nice and smooth and will use them as our wedding bands.,56042,3
56044,Bought this top in medium and i am usually that size however it fits somewhat large.,56044,3
56045,The dress is nice just like it was described in the picture.,56045,3
56046,This watch winder stopped working after less than a year of use.,56046,3
56046,Only one station still winds....is this normal?,56046,3
56047,Smaller on the waist on longer than esxpected.,56047,3
56050,Its pretty and it fits but its too open on the sides,56050,3
56051,Not my favorite star wars necklace.,56051,3
56051,My son collects them.,56051,3
56052,Not as long as it looks in the picture.,56052,3
56053,"Cute, but definitely turn your finger green.",56053,3
56053,"Good as props for photos, but not for daily wear.",56053,3
56054,Top was to small but bottoms fit well.,56054,3
56055,Length is a bit short.,56055,3
56055,I'll order 30 x 32 next time.,56055,3
56056,"The finish is not the usual soft, cotton fleece.",56056,3
56056,"It has a ""slick"" feeling to the finish.",56056,3
56056,The design is fine and as pictured.,56056,3
56056,"Very cute, but will be interesting to see how the fabric performs over time and washings.",56056,3
56057,it was a present for my daughter.,56057,3
56057,"I got her 3 pants, 2 were OK , 1 small.",56057,3
56057,The quality of fabric and craft are good.,56057,3
56058,Ordered my size but should have ordered one size bigger.,56058,3
56059,Bought these to use after my breast reduction.,56059,3
56059,I'm a 34D now and ordered the Large.,56059,3
56059,They are not easy to zip up if you are a D cup!,56059,3
56059,I need assistance to zip because they are tight.,56059,3
56059,I'm just laying around right now and not doing any physical activity and the zipper burst on one of them!,56059,3
56059,My husband had to cut me out of the bra.,56059,3
56059,"If you are ordering after breast surgery, order one size larger.",56059,3
56059,Hoping to use the remaining three bras as actual sports bras in a few more weeks.,56059,3
56060,Lenses will eventually pop out of frame.,56060,3
56061,"very cute, I'm a medium and ordered a large, it was still too small",56061,3
56062,"I like the fir of the ""Ease In To Comfort Fit"" Capri better.",56062,3
56063,"Im normally a 36C, bought a 38C (biggest available) because of the reviews saying it was to tight.",56063,3
56063,"Still very tight, and the ""underwire"" which is just very thin plastic, popped out, in the armpit area 5 minutes into wearing it.",56063,3
56063,"Its very cute, but very tight .",56063,3
56065,I bought a large but it fit rather like a small/medium.,56065,3
56068,I returned these because they were advertised as unisex.,56068,3
56068,There was absolutely no chance my son's size 10.5 foot would fit.,56068,3
56068,"However, they did have a super cute design.",56068,3
56068,Wish they had worked!,56068,3
56069,Runs very very small!!,56069,3
56069,"I ordered an XL, I usually wear anywhere from M to L depending on tops, but this one if they had a XXL, I don't think would fit either, way too small, really cute but small!",56069,3
56070,I'm only giving these pair of sunglasses 3 stars because when I received it already had a scratch on the lens.,56070,3
56070,But I still kept them because I can hardly see the scratch when I wear it.,56070,3
56071,Good fit and price.,56071,3
56071,One lens did pop out once but easily went back in.,56071,3
56072,"I had high hopes, but it just doesn't fit me.",56072,3
56072,"I thought it was a wrap dress but it's sewn shut with an elastic waist that you then put the tie belt over, and it's too bunchy on me and hits too high on my waist to look good.",56072,3
56072,"It's not a horrible length if I wear heels, I'm 5 ft, 95lbs, and it brushes on the floor.",56072,3
56072,"In fairness, I knew I was taking a risk with this style because I'm so teensy.",56072,3
56072,"The fabric is good, it's not flimsy and if you wear nude underthings you're fine.",56072,3
56072,It's also solidly made.,56072,3
56072,Not pristine but totally fine.,56072,3
56072,"Great pattern, I got the tan/black combo.",56072,3
56074,smaller than normal for the size i ordered and thinner,56074,3
56075,Perfect fit for size 6.,56075,3
56075,"Like the style, but very poor stitching.",56075,3
56076,Rubs small looks cheap,56076,3
56077,"color not like picture, also looser knit than picture",56077,3
56078,Also a little too big on the ears.,56078,3
56079,I'm sorry to say,56079,3
56081,not worth ten bucks if you ask me.,56081,3
56081,its ok but should cost cheaper being the material is a fake kind of chain.,56081,3
56081,feather light cheap material.,56081,3
56081,almost want to say it feels like plastic.,56081,3
56082,Worn it probably a dozen times and the gold is starting to come off.,56082,3
56083,"For the price I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but I never even wore the dress.",56083,3
56083,"When it came, the beads were very loose.",56083,3
56083,"They looked like they'd fall off if the were pulled, but didn't test it.",56083,3
56083,The sash had a frayed end (it looked like it never got sewn shut.,56083,3
56083,"It fit a lot more loose than I was expecting (I'm 5'4"", 105lbs and ordered a small).",56083,3
56083,I finally threw it away a few months ago after it sat in my closet with hopes that I would get around to fixing it/gain some weight.,56083,3
56083,Would probably have been okay for a few wears but can't see it standing up to much washing.,56083,3
56084,Tighter fit than expected.,56084,3
56085,A very pretty camisole but runs very small.,56085,3
56085,"I'd definitely purchase one size up, perhaps two.",56085,3
56086,"Other than that, great quality and fast delivery.",56086,3
56087,"Be warned, these are Asian sized so order at least 1 size larger",56087,3
56088,Fit is great except the cuffs.,56088,3
56088,i wear it because the print is nice.,56088,3
56088,It is not as comfortable as I would like.,56088,3
56089,the seam of the white underneath part goes right over the fuller part of my bust drawing more attention.,56089,3
56089,I have a similar one from motherhood that the underneath part covers all of my chest which I thought this one would be doing as well.,56089,3
56089,"It is good enough, but I'm constantly paranoid it will show off my bra if I move ever so slightly.",56089,3
56089,Spend 5 more dollars at motherhood and get better coverage!,56089,3
56090,"Fits as expected,  but see through in the back.",56090,3
56091,the only thing is: it doesn't look like the picture!!,56091,3
56091,It looks more like a sports bra and NOT a shirt.,56091,3
56091,was planning to wear it just as a crop top so I was disappointed.,56091,3
56091,I got it in a size medium.,56091,3
56092,Sleeves are a bit short and bulkier than expected but cute overall,56092,3
56093,This looks hot pink and that is what I expected but what I got was burgundy.,56093,3
56093,I would return for a refund but not worth the trouble.,56093,3
56093,Otherwise it looks pretty well made.,56093,3
56094,Nice quality and price but is too large to tiny boys,56094,3
56095,"My son likes this hoodie, but it is thin (it's jersey and not sweatshirt material).",56095,3
56095,"Also, he is already getting holes in it around the pocket.",56095,3
56097,"I like it well enough, but not a huge fan of the material.",56097,3
56098,"this portfolio are nice, but a little small",56098,3
56099,boring.... no sound coins too spotty,56099,3
56100,The sapphire blue color in the photo is beautiful but I received teal colored stones.,56100,3
56100,It doesn't look too fake and the quality is great for the price.,56100,3
56100,Would have given 5 stars if the color was accurate.,56100,3
56101,I'm an XL and it's a little small on me.,56101,3
56101,"Doesn't fit around the midsection with much left to keep it closed, but it's doable.",56101,3
56101,"Definitely cheaper material, hanging hook broke after a couple months of daily use and strings aplenty.",56101,3
56101,Hood is neato though.,56101,3
56102,"Great for the price, but a little itchy when worn for longer than an 8 hour workday.",56102,3
56103,The ring was intended for my husband (size 10.5) but ended up fitting my 9 year old son.,56103,3
56103,Also the punisher emblem was supposed to be engraved into the metal.,56103,3
56103,It looks more like a rub on emblem.,56103,3
56103,"My son ended up with the ring so it was okay, but it would've been great to have it be exactly what I ordered as the gift for my husband.",56103,3
56103,I will keep looking for another ring and hope this helps someone else in their purchase.,56103,3
56104,Simple light cotton t-shirt weight nightgown.,56104,3
56104,Gets the job done.,56104,3
56104,Is a little tighter than I expected but ok.,56104,3
56105,"I wore it for maybe a week...it didn't do much in terms of holding my belly in, but was gentle on the scar, due to silicon lining.",56105,3
56105,"It's ok, not more then that...I wouldn't buy it again.",56105,3
56107,I love these shoes.,56107,3
56107,My daughter has had them in every size since she's been walking.,56107,3
56107,"They fit well, easy to get on and stay closed.",56107,3
56107,Only reason I've giving three stars is these shoes are way over priced on here.,56107,3
56107,Shop around if you have time and find somewhere cheaper.,56107,3
56107,I bought these since I needed a bigger size quick for a vacation.,56107,3
56108,"I got this shirt, and it looks nothing like the picture.",56108,3
56108,"I'm not that upset though, for the price it was I wasn't expecting it to be that high of quality v(0-0)v",56108,3
56109,I was so excited when my husband bought this necklace for me.,56109,3
56109,"It arrived in great condition, wrapped in a nice velvet bag.",56109,3
56109,"I would have loved to give this 5 stars, but unfortunately when my 5 year old was playing with it the wand part broke in 2 pieces.",56109,3
56109,I thought it was a little sturdier than that.,56109,3
56109,"Granted, I was not happy that my 5 year old was playing with it, but life happens, and I would have liked the metal to be a little stronger than it was.",56109,3
56110,It was a little snug around the jawline,56110,3
56111,I like it but I only found one size - XL and it is far too big and I will have to spend an additional $10 to get it made shorter,56111,3
56113,"The quality is good, although they run small.",56113,3
56114,The Crotchal area/piece was too large so that the c-section piece is actually above the incision.,56114,3
56115,"As advertised, except it ran small so couldn't wear it on the finger I planned to.",56115,3
56115,Probably about a half to full size too small.,56115,3
56116,They are very pretty for the cost.,56116,3
56116,Problem I had is the backs don't screw on properly causing back to be stripped and just turn never being able to tighten.,56116,3
56117,Good shirt but tight in the arms.,56117,3
56117,I gym often which plays into the issue so not really a knock on the company.,56117,3
56117,I'm 6'1 185 lbs for reference and ordered a large.,56117,3
56117,I guess and XL since these run a bit small.,56117,3
56118,Hated that I had to sign for it.,56118,3
56119,Ordered a large and the cardigan barely reaches my butt (I'm 5'1) and the sleeves are too loose for me.,56119,3
56120,"I have a rectangular body with a butt, so these fit a little baggier in the pelvic/hip area.",56120,3
56120,Cute design and comfortable.,56120,3
56120,"Food for thought, the netting over the green on the legs frays quite easily.",56120,3
56121,nice fit - nice colour - the lettering has cracks in them,56121,3
56122,Top was very small although I ordered a medium.,56122,3
56122,"The shorts fit great, but the top barely covered my breast!",56122,3
56122,"Afraid, shorts will be too big if I exchanged for a large.",56122,3
56122,"I am usually a size 0-3  and so I followed the advice from Customer review, and ordered  a medium.",56122,3
56123,Cute shirt but very thin material.,56123,3
56123,I bought it assuming I'd have to wear a cami or something under it and you absolutely do but it still seemed big.,56123,3
56124,"I like it, but wish it were bigger.",56124,3
56125,Style is nice but not designed for girls with long torsos.,56125,3
56126,"These are really pretty and the top fits fine; however, the bottoms are long enough for a basketball player.",56126,3
56126,No so bad except it's really hard to hem this type material.,56126,3
56127,Even as an adult hat it's huge!,56127,3
56128,I feel like these rings always want to slide off my fingers.,56128,3
56128,But they are really cute!,56128,3
56129,I wear a medium and ordered a large.,56129,3
56129,Dress too tight and too small.,56129,3
56129,Dress advertised as high quality.,56129,3
56129,Fabric cheap for the price paid.,56129,3
56130,I always get a half size up in my tennis shoes.,56130,3
56130,For some reason these feel to big in the heel area and wide.,56130,3
56131,"Beautiful chiffon material and colors, but small and doesn't fit like the picture if you have a sista bottom and thighs.",56131,3
56131,You sistas know what I mean.,56131,3
56132,It wasn't what I expected but still a great ring with at nice fit.,56132,3
56133,I ended up returning this item because I read reviews recommending to buy a size larger than you normally would.,56133,3
56133,For a jacket I like wiggle room so I never buy jackets perfectly fitted.,56133,3
56133,I bought a size larger and the jacket ended up being way too big and it was a lot bulkier than I thought it was going to be.,56133,3
56133,"I hate feeling too bundled up, so it just wasn't for me.",56133,3
56133,"I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I was disappointed that it was noticeably not spot on as far as details go with the Harley Quinn jacket in the movie, but it is still a nice jacket.",56133,3
56133,It shipped quickly and the return was very easy.,56133,3
56133,The seller is great as far as their return policy which I extremely appreciated.,56133,3
56134,Cute but not comfy.,56134,3
56134,The fabric isn't soft and the elastic waistband makes my daughter freak out so she doesn't want to wear it.,56134,3
56134,"She says it is ""itchy"".",56134,3
56135,I thought I should get the large but it is not loose but is a little snug.,56135,3
56136,Way bigger than I was expecting!,56136,3
56136,It's not bad purchase with respect to the price.,56136,3
56136,The quality is okay.,56136,3
56136,"It is a deeper purple than the picture and I thought the material was cotton, but the description states that is is a chiffon material.",56136,3
56137,"It's lovely, soft material and the fit around the shoulders is good but it is much shorter than expected",56137,3
56138,Earrings are pretty well made.,56138,3
56138,The backs they come with aren't very tight that's prolly why they come with backs like that so you have to re-buy the set if lost.,56138,3
56138,Over all ok for the cost,56138,3
56139,It was to large and i had to shipped back.,56139,3
56139,You got to put in the right size or you will have to pay to ship it back.,56139,3
56139,I had to pay for it to be ship out and to pay for it be ship back.,56139,3
56139,Like the hat but did not like to pay for all the shipping.,56139,3
56139,I wish there was a better way.,56139,3
56140,It is very  comfortable.,56140,3
56141,It's not as free flowing as it shows in the picture and the sleeves are rather restricting,56141,3
56142,Decent quality for the price paid.,56142,3
56142,"Slightly snug, but nothing that a little tightening up of the body can't fix",56142,3
56143,"Photo is quite misleading, dose not really glow all that well.",56143,3
56143,Glows green after letting it sit in a black light for bit.,56143,3
56144,The waistline is the same on all the pants.,56144,3
56144,I am not sure how you get the size difference when only the legs are different sizes.,56144,3
56144,The waistline should reflect the sized difference as well as the legs.,56144,3
56145,"A bit to small, but still wearable.",56145,3
56146,Pretty and large ring not ecpenciv looking or as dark as pic the stone is like a raspberry color but it's very pretty for what you are paying.,56146,3
56147,I loved this dress!,56147,3
56147,"However, this dress is receiving 3 stars from me because the dress is rather short, and being only 5'7, it came up just higher than my ankle - it was that slightly awkward too short length.",56147,3
56147,"I still wore it to the wedding I attended, and it was very comfortable, but I do wish that this had been made a couple of inches longer.",56147,3
56148,I thought this would be a perfect fit for my small head but even it is a bit big.,56148,3
56148,The color is accurate to the description and picture and I love the style.,56148,3
56149,I was disappointed I only received #1.,56149,3
56149,It said a pack which means more than 1.,56149,3
56150,Chain broke at clasp,56150,3
56151,"Seller was great getting me a new product after my original one was lost in the mail, so it took me TWO MONTHS to get this bag.",56151,3
56151,I got the tan studded one.,56151,3
56151,"I have a couple of issues, the bag is tan all over but the edges of the faux leather are black.",56151,3
56151,"In the pictures it was solid tan, no black outlining.",56151,3
56151,I'm not very happy with that.,56151,3
56151,"The bag came scuffed, but I was able to get the scuff marks off.",56151,3
56151,"a couple of the studs are scratched, so the silver is showing through the tan color.",56151,3
56151,"Some of the stitching is a little sloppy, tho it seems fairly sturdy.",56151,3
56151,"Overall I still like the bag, its very cute, but I'm very disappointed in the black trimming, it really cheapens the look of the bag, and other customer images did not have this black trimming, maybe I got a reject one after my first one went missing.",56151,3
56152,"Loved these and they were super cute, just didn't like that they were smushed and had to try and fluff the flower back out.",56152,3
56153,not what we expected,56153,3
56154,nice for a cheap necklace,56154,3
56155,"Doesnt exactly fit as shown, not very flattering.",56155,3
56155,"Good quality though, may just depend on what size you are.",56155,3
56156,"Decent quality socks, kinda thin for my taste.",56156,3
56156,SHIPPED ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA so it takes a while to get to you.,56156,3
56158,"The charm is cute, no problems there, but the chain broke after wearing it for a few days.",56158,3
56160,Didn't come near the floor on me.,56160,3
56160,"I'm 6""0 tall for reference.",56160,3
56160,I have a semi-thin wedding dress that is made of lace.,56160,3
56160,The hoops were visible through the dress and it made my mermaid dress look awkward.,56160,3
56160,"There is no way to tell which way is the front or the back, so it's hooped the same all the way around.",56160,3
56160,Just not what I expected.,56160,3
56161,Just thought they would be a little bigger - I had gotten my metric socket set out to see what 1/3 looked like and they are not that size.....,56161,3
56162,I'm giving 3 stars because this is beautiful and so inexpensive compared to others like it.,56162,3
56162,BUT it was difficult to take out and it ended up breaking (not staying closed) the third time I wore it.,56162,3
56163,Good shoe to wear around the house for the youngins.,56163,3
56163,"Not really a skateboard shoe, my son wore out both pairs of these shoes I got for him very quickly.",56163,3
56163,I should probably pay more attention to what I'm buying but the price was great.,56163,3
56164,"Too heavy for my ears, had to return.",56164,3
56164,Otherwise a nice product and as described.,56164,3
56165,Cute and it fits comfortably on my bulging belly!,56165,3
56166,I don't like the fit of these shirts.,56166,3
56166,"The material is thick and clingy, and it rides up quite easily.",56166,3
56166,"The colors were nice though, and the shirts didn't shrink or fade in the wash. Maybe ordering up a size will help offset how clingy these shirts are.",56166,3
56167,somewhat small so doesn't look near as full and flattering as it could - at least on me.,56167,3
56168,"Great just should of ordered a size bigger , thin material ripped fast",56168,3
56169,"It was a lot smaller than expected, luckily i ordered 2 sizes bigger than needed for a flowy look, which it still doesnt give",56169,3
56170,This dress is TINY.,56170,3
56170,I was shocked when I opened the bag and saw how tiny the garment was.,56170,3
56170,I'm not returning it and paying shipping to China for a refund.,56170,3
56170,It will take months for a refund and shipping is exorbitant.,56170,3
56170,t's a cute dress n pretty but not for an adult.,56170,3
56170,And not for a woman with even a nipple that pokes out with no other breast tissue.,56170,3
56170,I got the large and there's no way my 36DD's will fit in this dress.,56170,3
56170,Even if you are a 00 you may find this dress snug.,56170,3
56171,"After reading reviews that this jacket runs small I ordered a large ,instead of medium.",56171,3
56171,Too big but fine with layers on.,56171,3
56172,very nice but not true size,56172,3
56173,Cute knock off accessory.,56173,3
56173,The shipping was faster than anticipated.,56173,3
56173,"After wearing a few times, the clasp gets loose.",56173,3
56173,Sometimes I find myself catching it as it's about to fall off my wrist.,56173,3
56173,I tend to walk at a fast pace and swing my arms.,56173,3
56173,I still continue to wear the bracelet carefully.,56173,3
56175,"I really like this purse, but it has a strong chemical smell that wouldn't go away even after I aired it out for a week and more.",56175,3
56176,"Not as expected, buy this for a kid because it doesn't fit an adult",56176,3
56177,Shirt comes unlaced with the metal clasp thingys.,56177,3
56177,You have to lace then knot them on.,56177,3
56177,"I am 5'7"" about 185ish,wear a L sometimes xl in juniors, 13 pants.",56177,3
56177,I ordered a xl and it didn't fit.,56177,3
56177,I couldn't get my arms thru.,56177,3
56177,"My arms are thicker, but the fact this is made of chiffon material & no stretch, doesn't help.",56177,3
56177,"Unfortunately this was the largest size, so I just have to return.",56177,3
56177,I would say order about 2 sizes larger than your normal size.,56177,3
56178,"As far as keeping the sun out your face and off your neck, it's great!",56178,3
56178,"However, it's not true to size when putting it on.",56178,3
56179,"Ring looks great, feels great, fits great.",56179,3
56179,"I've had it for two months now, everyday use never comes off.",56179,3
56179,I'm in the towing business so this ring was the obvious choice.,56179,3
56179,About a month ago it suffered a small rip.,56179,3
56179,"I don't know how it tore, but it was disappointing.",56179,3
56179,I thought it would stand up to rigorous activity.,56179,3
56179,"Surprisingly the rip has not spread, I still wear it, just a little looser.",56179,3
56179,"It's starting to become a nuisance, so I will have to replace it.",56179,3
56179,For the price I would buy again.,56179,3
56179,"But I think to go with something with warranty, what can I say I like to buy things once.",56179,3
56180,The dress looks very nice.,56180,3
56180,"It's made out of thick material, so it definitely doesn't look or feel cheap.",56180,3
56180,"However, the corset back was very uncomfortable to wear even though I loosen it as much as I could already.",56180,3
56180,"I just order the size that I normally wear, didn't size up or down.",56180,3
56181,Very nice dress but fits large!,56181,3
56182,I had to tighten up the waist a little more,56182,3
56183,Doesn't lookexactly  like the picture but I would not buy again not top quality workmanship.,56183,3
56184,Kinda falls down after a while though...,56184,3
56185,"It runs small, but cute",56185,3
56187,Its Ok. Not very sturdy arch support.,56187,3
56187,i think I would like to go with a different version that has more arch support.,56187,3
56187,These I believe are not really aggressive as I'd like to have had.,56187,3
56187,A lot better than anything your average shoe comes with.,56187,3
56188,Cut big but very comfortable,56188,3
56189,Sizing is not very accurate.,56189,3
56189,I bought one previously that was a size less and it was somewhat to tight and this one is.,56189,3
56190,the veil portion required an adjustment as it was like lace bangs instead of falling over the eyes.,56190,3
56190,but it was a great buy for the price and was fairly easy to adjust the veil by removing and reapplying with hot glue,56190,3
56191,"The bottoms fit good but the top I'm still a little confused, because the straps seem a bit short.",56191,3
56191,Therefore the top fits a bit tight and my chest is not big.,56191,3
56192,Very pretty and nice but much thinner than I would have liked.,56192,3
56193,It doesn't big my body like I thought it would.,56193,3
56193,"I ordered a size up after reading the reviews, maybe that was a mistake.",56193,3
56194,Why so cheap with the material?,56194,3
56194,Length is good however!,56194,3
56195,It's not as nice as the photo.,56195,3
56195,"Not as polished, and not as clean sculpt/casting....",56195,3
56197,So this is basically a big folded over rectangle with two arm holes.,56197,3
56197,"It's not what i was expecting, but the fabric was high quality cotton and the design was still really nice.",56197,3
56197,"I'm only 5""1' so it doesn't exactly work for me.",56197,3
56197,"I'm slightly disappointed, but I will probably use the cloth to turn it into a skirt.",56197,3
56198,"Beautiful dress, but a bit of an odd fit: the sleeves are baggy on my petite 8 year old, but the dress is FAR too short to be considered a dress.",56198,3
56198,"It fits more like a tunic or a long shirt, and I highly recommend being prepared with leggings or jeans to wear with it.",56198,3
56198,It does not even reach past her mid-thigh.,56198,3
56198,My daughter is actually on the shorter side for her age!,56198,3
56198,"Regardless, it's everything my daughter could want in one piece of clothing: flowers, ponies, bows, and the color pink.",56198,3
56198,"Even though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, she loves it and is none the wiser.",56198,3
56198,The quality is decent but not outstanding - the stitching is well done but the fabric is fairly thin and will definitely require a jacket in the fall and winter months.,56198,3
56199,"I expect that when I order an XL it will actually be XL, not Medium or smaller.",56199,3
56199,"I know I am not a super skinny woman, but this was beyond tiny, there is no way at all that this could be considered XL anywhere.",56199,3
56199,It is a lovely dress and when my daughter grows another 2 or 3 inches  I will let her try it on as it is more likely to fit my 80 lb daughter than me at this point.,56199,3
56200,This jacket looks pretty but it does not look like the picture I gotta say.,56200,3
56200,"The overall look is a little different, more girly I might add it looks like it'd would go well with a dress or a skirt underneath.",56200,3
56200,You can't really tell by the picture much but the part where the arms come out is not loose at all they kinda are more like small holes at the bottom of the overall jacket.,56200,3
56200,"So only your hands come out I suppose you could cut out some space to make it loose like this one in the picture, but of course that's not the idea when you buy it.",56200,3
56200,Overall I thought it was pretty :) although I am not a fan of the material or the way it looks in the end since it looks a little different from the picture.,56200,3
56200,"It is still nice for going out and looks dressed up so I might change my mind later, depending how it looks when I actually wear it outside.",56200,3
56200,"I am mostly let down by the material used for this jacket though since it feels a little cheap on the inside mostly, almost like a costume.",56200,3
56201,Don't really like how it sits on my head but I'll eventually wear it one day.,56201,3
56201,Don't really want to spend time out of my day sending it back for a refund.,56201,3
56202,Nice looking but really do not care for the small cord tied in front.,56202,3
56202,Fit is a touch snug.,56202,3
56202,Purchased two pair will probably not get any more.,56202,3
56203,I love the color of these underwear and my son thinks they are cool.,56203,3
56203,"Unfortunately after washing just once, two of them had a small hole appear in the seam of the crotch.",56203,3
56203,So I'm disappointed in the quality.,56203,3
56203,Maybe I just got a defective batch.,56203,3
56204,"Beautiful top but even though I wear a small normally, I ordered a medium which was too small so then ordered a xl which is still kind of small but will do.",56204,3
56205,The shirt was really cute and fit really good but the pants was really short like they came a little past her knees and she's a 3t I should've bought a 4t-5t I would order a size or two up,56205,3
56206,"The skirt is beautiful, the material seems to be of great quality, but, the color on some of the stripes are faded.",56206,3
56207,"I like these socks, and they give me a chance to be a little rebellious in a boring office environment.",56207,3
56207,"One of the pairs already had holes in them, and another pair was so small that they were difficult to put on.",56207,3
56207,"I suppose next time, I will purchase the next larger size and deal with them falling around my ankles; better that than having my feet turn purple.",56207,3
56207,I also wish they were longer.,56207,3
56207,It's not good showing off your legs because your socks are too short.,56207,3
56208,"I ordered the 18-24 month size, my son wears 18 month right now so I thought I'd be safe.",56208,3
56208,"My son is tall, 32"" or so...maybe that's why?",56208,3
56208,The legs were too short and when he bent over all the snaps would bust open!,56208,3
56208,I was bummed because it was very cute and seems well made!,56208,3
56209,This bra is for petite women.,56209,3
56209,It came with a bra extension for clipping it on in the back and was still tight.,56209,3
56209,"It also has itchy elastic and lace, an unwelcome sensation for a maternity bra.",56209,3
56209,"Adorable style, color, and print.",56209,3
56210,But not for big boobed girls.,56210,3
56210,The cup doesn't cover and im busting out the side.,56210,3
56211,Material is course not a soft blend.,56211,3
56211,Its for a gift and once they wash it it might be softer.,56211,3
56212,I ordered a size 11 that fit a little bit smaller than other size 11s which was disappointing because I always buy shoes a size or a half bigger than my son's actual size but this fit is almost exact that he won't get much wear so if you are purchasing make it a bigger size also the colour isn't as bright red as the pic look but other than those things I am pleased.,56212,3
56213,This is a very bohemian wrap.,56213,3
56213,It's not sewn very well and it's definitely synthetic.,56213,3
56213,Nonetheless it looks cool with a shirt and jeans.,56213,3
56213,I like it and only deducted stars for poor construction.,56213,3
56215,"It says to order a size larger than you wear, I wish I ordered my normal size (M) bc the large is too big.",56215,3
56215,Even if I pin the back my bra is very visible.,56215,3
56215,It will cost more to exchange so I'm giving it to a friend.,56215,3
56216,"I wore this once to a festival and got many compliments, its cute but I wouldnt wear it unless I going to the beach or to a festival, the material is kind of plastic-y but other than that its true to the image, I definetly suggest ordering a size or two up if you want the proper fit.",56216,3
56217,Nice color nice material but way too short.,56217,3
56217,I'm 5'9 and it nearly hit my knees lol this is for someone about 5'6 or 5'7 any taller than then and it won't fit well.,56217,3
56218,This mask is okay but bleeds like crazy.,56218,3
56218,My pillow case has black stains on it.,56218,3
56218,Suggest washing it first before using to wash off the dye.,56218,3
56219,Great travel bag for.,56219,3
56219,"Gave 3 stars as the shoulder strap keeps slipping going to stitch it to stop, change the material that strap is made or have a way to lock it in place would than give it 5 stars.",56219,3
56220,Dimensions of wallet make it unwieldy and flap is constantly opening.,56220,3
56221,Size M y a L,56221,3
56222,Way smaller than I thought.,56222,3
56222,It's more like coin purse size.,56222,3
56222,"It smelled funky too, like mildew/mold.",56222,3
56222,Had to Febreeze it to get the smell out.,56222,3
56224,I'm sure the product works well but the size I was measured to get from the chart was too big.,56224,3
56225,"Nice shoe, but the design is rather odd in that the tongue of the shoe won't stay in place.",56225,3
56225,It bothers my son enough that he only wears them occasionally.,56225,3
56225,The shoe itself is good quality but that particular design feature seems to be problematic.,56225,3
56225,It could be solved easily with a little loop or fabric to hold the tongue in place (DC shoes and Nike usually have this feature).,56225,3
56225,It's not easy to see on the pictures but it's a problem.,56225,3
56227,"I didn't love the way it fit me around my stomach area, I feel like it made that area look bigger than it really is!",56227,3
56227,"I got a medium and I am 5'7, weigh 145.",56227,3
56227,"The way in which it was made was an issue too, where you attach the straps in the front, one side had a strap hole area so small, that it almost impossible to fit the strap metal piece in.",56227,3
56228,"He loved the color but the size was too big, I don't know anything about the arch support so I really couldn't answer that question.",56228,3
56228,He will be exchanging them for a different size.,56228,3
56230,Runs INCREDIBLY small compared to name brand .,56230,3
56231,Runs small and has removable cups which fold and move when wearing.,56231,3
56232,These leggings are a nice quality but they are not made for a thicker girl.,56232,3
56232,I wear a size 11 in pants and I could not get these pants over my thighs and butt properly.,56232,3
56232,If u are smaller than a size 11 or perhaps have a flatter butt u should be fine.,56232,3
56232,I should have known better when I saw one size fits all.,56232,3
56233,Ordered a large based on my jacket size.,56233,3
56233,"As I went to tie my shoes, I realized I should have ordered an XL.",56233,3
56234,I like the style of the gloves but they really don't work for using your touch screen phones.,56234,3
56235,I love the band and after an exhaustive search I picked this one.,56235,3
56235,Overall pretty happy but the rings and buckles do not have a PVD finish but rather a painted or at best a powder coated finish which has wore through to metal in about 1 month.,56235,3
56235,Overall would buy again but disappointed in the false description.,56235,3
56236,so I purchase this because I saw a few ladies that look great in the suit that was a tad bit thicker than I was.,56236,3
56236,I weigh 174 at 5'3.,56236,3
56236,Now I don't have the biggest butt..but the bottom is entirely too small!!,56236,3
56236,I thought I could get away having a little pouch but nooooooo....it overlaps the suit!!,56236,3
56236,I will have to get lipo to look sexy as these ladies did!!,56236,3
56236,not going to happen!!,56236,3
56238,But the chain broke so easily.,56238,3
56238,Currently looking for a new chain or cord to replace so I can wear it again.,56238,3
56239,The size it is too large,56239,3
56240,Looks better on the website than it does in person.,56240,3
56241,"Kinda flimsy, and too wide for my nose.",56241,3
56242,sizes are too small..but the co. was excellent exchanging the size for a bigger one,56242,3
56244,The top was too small,56244,3
56245,A little funky looking in person but my 9 year old loves them and that's what counts.,56245,3
56246,It was not the same color and it was small but I will still keep it.,56246,3
56247,Either I'm bigger than I thought or they run small.,56247,3
56247,"I'm a small in pants (3), but I got a medium because I have bigger hips (hourglass shape).",56247,3
56247,"They are low waisted and sexy, but it makes my fat stick out.",56247,3
56248,"I wish it was as big in person as it was in the picture,  it also looks a bit cheap  (but it was dirt cheap lol).",56248,3
56249,The fit is true to size.,56249,3
56249,The appearance is so-so.,56249,3
56249,I could get the same look at a cheaper price in TJ Maxx or some other clothing discount store,56249,3
56250,Just a bit smaller in fit but boosts look and appeal.. Nice product.,56250,3
56252,The first thing  I noticed about these leggings the second I touch them was just how supersoft they were.,56252,3
56252,I mean I wish I could make a bed out of these leggings!,56252,3
56252,"However when I put them on, I could barely get them around my middle.",56252,3
56252,"I wear a size within the range that is listed on the plus size leggings, but I definitely do not fit into these leggings.",56252,3
56252,"I am a size 22/24, but if you are in 18/20, you should fit into these just fine.",56252,3
56252,I am so disappointed that I don't fit into them because they are so soft and I think they would be so comfortable.,56252,3
56254,"Love this swimsuit, but I ordered it twice bc its sooo big even the 2nd one I got was still a little big, I don't recommend if you're bigger in the bust area it doesnt hold them in well, and get your own bottoms ladies it doesn't come with any!",56254,3
56255,"Sizing seems off as noted too small for what I was looking for also, because of that not comfortable to wear.",56255,3
56255,"The color was great, pockets good & I'd sized right I imagine the drap would be nice.",56255,3
56255,Still since I can't really wear it a big disappointment.,56255,3
56256,"Other reviews said to size up, so I did.",56256,3
56256,I think you need to go 2 sizes up.,56256,3
56257,"I purchased the black sweater, size L. I normally wear a US 4-6 but purchased a larger size because I was worried about it shrinking or the arms being too short.",56257,3
56257,"That wasn't an issue, a small or medium might have been fine (I like sweaters a bit larger).",56257,3
56257,I now need to do some seamstress magic to make it smaller.,56257,3
56257,That isn't too much an issue since the seams aren't 'finished' like many sweaters.,56257,3
56257,They seems to have a rough edge (not folded over) with some stitching to prevent unraveling.,56257,3
56257,I wish the fabric had more...something.,56257,3
56257,"I feel like when I put that on I can't see anything but a big, black sweater.",56257,3
56257,"The cross-over front blends in, like I'm wearing a tunic (maybe because it's too large?).",56257,3
56257,I've seen the cute Pinterest pics of identical sweaters but in different colors; I thought the black would be more of a charcoal like I've seen but this is a jet black fabric and it all just blends in together.,56257,3
56258,"too, too, small not a medium",56258,3
56259,Couldn't get the smaller size I needed.,56259,3
56260,It could have been better if it fits me.,56260,3
56260,I'm 5'3 and 110 lbs.,56260,3
56260,ordered small already but it still seem a bit large for me.,56260,3
56261,"Adorable hat, cute colors, great coverage.",56261,3
56261,"My only complaint is that the straps are just ties,, no way to make a safe break away if need be AND the hat keeps coming loose, so I have to re-tighten it often!",56261,3
56263,"I was hoping this would work with leggings, but it's too short and the hem is oddly cinched compared to the baggy-ness of the body of the shirt.",56263,3
56263,"I wore it with jeans, but it's pretty *mep* overall.",56263,3
56264,"Just received mine and they look and feel great, in my hand :)
My ears are 9/6 (14mm) but im finding it diffcult to put them in.",56264,3
56265,"Decent cut, but diamond better white",56265,3
56266,I bought this once the wire came loose the company was nice enough to replace it no hassles.,56266,3
56266,But then the second one the wire came out completely but I had a bit of a hassle this time getting a refund.,56266,3
56266,I decided to wait on replacing it I figured there must have been a run on defective shirts.,56266,3
56266,It's too bad the shirt was lot's of fun.,56266,3
56267,Had this awful smell to it.,56267,3
56268,This needs to be handled with way too much care; which I realized given the structure.,56268,3
56268,"While it's beautiful, a few of the ""beads"" were already chipping after the first wear!",56268,3
56268,And a couple links on one strand broke.,56268,3
56268,It's noticeable but I know it's there.,56268,3
56268,I like it but I would not buy it again.,56268,3
56269,"While cute, this cardigan was way too small.",56269,3
56269,"I'm a petite 5'0, and wear xtra-small or small in everything, but this is too small even for me.",56269,3
56269,Unfortunately I've never been able to wear it to comment on that.,56269,3
56270,"These are really cute, but also very fragile.",56270,3
56270,"I wouldn't recommend using them for actual UV protection, either; they're more like a fashion accessory than a functional item.",56270,3
56270,They came with a bag to store them in.,56270,3
56271,"Great look, but somewhat thinner material than I would like.",56271,3
56271,Consider options for modesty.,56271,3
56273,"Not like photo at all, they are actually purple kinda bummed but they are good quality & cheap.",56273,3
56275,"These shirts don't hold their shape, and the royal blue has inconsistent color after first wash.",56275,3
56276,"Well, I ordered a three and my child didn't get to fit them well until she got into a 5 or 6.",56276,3
56276,"The tie doesn't stay kept for long, my child easily comes out them.",56276,3
56276,"I love the texture and the authentic look but I don't like how the tongue easily comes out of the tie, which makes it hard for my baby to keep them on and walk.",56276,3
56277,It's great for the price.,56277,3
56277,"It says ""guaranteed bubble free"" on the package it came in.",56277,3
56277,I just spent an hour trying to get the bubbles off and while doing so fibers got on the sticky side and I ended up throwing this one in the trash.,56277,3
56277,I love how it did protect the glass through.,56277,3
56277,Is already broken so this helps me feel safe that it won't crack open.,56277,3
56277,I will be getting another one.,56277,3
56277,With this it's trial and error due to no instructions on application.,56277,3
56278,Got larger size and they fit my small 5 yr old,56278,3
56279,I love this bracelet - bought it for a Halloween costume but couldn't wait to wear it again.,56279,3
56279,"The next time I tried it put it on, it snapped right in half.",56279,3
56280,Love these but zipper will not stay zipped,56280,3
56281,I expected an expandable brim.,56281,3
56281,It fits tight but not uncomfortable,56281,3
56282,Fits a little too snug than what I like.,56282,3
56283,It is not as loose or sweatshirt-like as depicted.,56283,3
56283,"It looks cute, but the sleeves are not lined at all, so you can feel all the sequins on your arms, and it is way too uncomfortable.",56283,3
56284,I bought them for a costume.,56284,3
56284,"A little too narrow for me, but otherwise ok",56284,3
56285,"At first it was very hard to open, it looked really nice.",56285,3
56285,"a couple weeks in, the clasp wouldn't stay shut so it keeps falling out.",56285,3
56285,Was nice while it lasted.,56285,3
56286,"For the price, it's great.",56286,3
56286,"I don't know how they determined it to be a ""smartphone"" wristlet, but it does accommodate one (but I might not be able to hear it ring).",56286,3
56286,The different compartments will keep me organized.,56286,3
56287,This might have been nice on someone with a bigger breast size than me.,56287,3
56287,It was too bulky for me up top though and made my already small chest look non-existent.,56287,3
56289,I'm not sure if its my body type but the straps keep slipping off my shoulders no matter how tight it is,56289,3
56290,The ridge and end pieces are not finished and make the bracelet look cheap.,56290,3
56291,But don't like the shower curtain material.,56291,3
56291,Not soft on the skin,56291,3
56292,"Nice pattern, collar is somewhat askew, material is thin.",56292,3
56292,"If I lived on a island, I'd have no complaints.",56292,3
56292,Size is a wee smaller than listed.,56292,3
56293,I ordered a pink but received a deep wine color which I did not care for.,56293,3
56293,The shirt fit well but I returned it because the wrong color was sent.,56293,3
56294,"The shirt is cute and made pretty well, but it is not a loose-fitting tshirt as pictured.",56294,3
56295,"I still don't feel it justifies that fact that it is worth $30, it is cheaply made.",56295,3
56296,it's a super cute shirt.,56296,3
56296,it just ripped very easily.,56296,3
56296,my daughter wore it once.,56296,3
56296,but it tore at the seam.,56296,3
56297,It was pretty small,56297,3
56298,Comfy but not for tall people.,56298,3
56298,"I am 5'10"" and got the XL and it is too short.",56298,3
56298,it pulls on the shoulders when I sit.,56298,3
56298,"Also, weird pockets on the hips make them look larger.",56298,3
56298,These have four total pockets and that seems like a little more than you would ever need in PJs.,56298,3
56299,"Very comfortable but runs a little bit large, the reason I give it 3 stars is that the back of the shoe digs into my heal very sharply and has caused a calous unless I wear thick socks!",56299,3
56300,"The product looked and fit like I expected, like a typical crew neck sweatshirt.",56300,3
56300,"The sizing was a little smaller than I expected, but not so much so that I couldn't wear it.",56300,3
56300,"I think it's unisex, I know the product is shown on a male but I'm a girl and I think it's just fine.",56300,3
56300,"It shrunk when I washed and dried in the the dryer, so also consider that when determining you proper size.",56300,3
56301,Not the quality I thought it would be,56301,3
56302,Expected the top to be a little less tight than it is.,56302,3
56303,"This is a cute dress, however I will have to return it.",56303,3
56303,I have curves and this dress is very fitted due to the stretchy material.,56303,3
56303,"If you are curvy, consider wearing shapewear underneath.",56303,3
56303,I ordered a large and it was still very tight.,56303,3
56303,Probably would look best on slim women like the model shown.,56303,3
56304,It's a cute bag - but it's not super well made.,56304,3
56304,It does unravel a but at the stitching and the grommets tend to pop out.,56304,3
56304,The jewels also fall out.,56304,3
56304,"For the price, it isn't bad, but don't expect it to last super long.",56304,3
56305,You would need another camisole under this camisole because of the material.,56305,3
56306,Cuter in the picture than in person.,56306,3
56306,Washed well in cold water.,56306,3
56307,"its ok, a little too snug.",56307,3
56307,"I like it though, very light and aery.",56307,3
56308,did not like the quality,56308,3
56309,"It's not as cute in person, the photos look great but it's super cheap",56309,3
56310,This swimsuit was too short for my already short torso.,56310,3
56310,It did not support my boobs at all.,56310,3
56310,And was definitely not swimsuit material.,56310,3
56310,My grandma loved it and it fit her perfectly so I gave it to her.,56310,3
56310,I'm glad that she loved it.,56310,3
56311,My daughter thinks this is a tab bit short and the material is a bit shiny.,56311,3
56311,"I disagree on the shinyness of the fabric, but it is a little short on my 5'3"" frame.",56311,3
56311,"I boughta large size because I didn't want cling, rather Iw anted the skirt to flow.",56311,3
56311,I made the right choice.,56311,3
56311,"I paid full price for this item, so this is an honest review.",56311,3
56311,"Some of the pictures accompanying the reviews show really tight skirts...not actually so it you buy it large enough to fit, Lol.",56311,3
56312,Large in the bottom bout not big enough to in the arms and across the back.,56312,3
56312,Feels bulky but tight,56312,3
56313,I like the dress but ordered a larger size based on reviews and that was a mistake.,56313,3
56313,There was way too much room in the hips and I have good size hips.,56313,3
56313,I need a large for my size 10-12.,56313,3
56313,The slit in the back is not high so now sure about other review.,56313,3
56315,they show a little,56315,3
56316,package was squashed and shoes were misshapen when they arrived.,56316,3
56316,reported the issue to seller.,56316,3
56316,need to give them as part of a welcome baby package so didn't have time to return.,56316,3
56316,"have ordered/received other crib shoes and these were definitely less structured and softer, and I prefer shoes with sturdier material.",56316,3
56316,an okay buy but will not purchase again,56316,3
56317,"I like them, but they're a bit short for my nose.",56317,3
56317,"I bent them, so they do fit now, but I plan to get different ones.",56317,3
56318,I'm planing on wearing it to a wedding.,56318,3
56318,The only issue I had is the color.,56318,3
56318,I ordered it in army green and it came in grey.,56318,3
56318,I reordered it again to see it I get the correct color.,56318,3
56321,"For the price I can not complain, I love Disney and the little mermaid:) I have not been in the pool get with this, really got it for fun and if I enjoy I will get a better made one.",56321,3
56321,This one is actually just to see before spending more.,56321,3
56321,"I am 6ft tall and it fits ok. Reason for 3 stars is because it's just not one of your daily swim ones, but it is cute, mine seems well made and if anything I will take some cute pictures!",56321,3
56322,"Mine fits pretty well, I wear and XS (5'4, 100lbs), and it fits pretty true to size.",56322,3
56322,"It came with a label that says Topshop, so it is a blatant knockoff, but you really can't tell the difference.",56322,3
56322,"The only thing I wish the lower snaps were fake, because sometimes when sitting certain ways (getting into the car for example), the snaps pop open.",56322,3
56322,"It would be better if only the top 2 opened to allow for getting it on and off, but the snaps on the bottom are useless, and I have to be careful when I'm out that they don't pop open.",56322,3
56322,I wil probably fix this with some glue.,56322,3
56322,"Otherwise, a super cute skirt a fraction of the price of the real deal.",56322,3
56323,"Runs small, so make sure you but two sizes bigger if you want it to fit like it's shown in the picture!",56323,3
56325,"Wasn't worth the price, but it was neat to wear to The Force Awakens premier",56325,3
56326,Chain was a little shorter than I expected.,56326,3
56326,"But other than that, I love it.",56326,3
56327,go two sizes larger warm and cozy but the sizing is a problem!,56327,3
56328,Not that great of quality wore one time but then just tossed not good quality,56328,3
56329,Cute but way too small,56329,3
56331,not sure if i like it so much in person,56331,3
56332,It is perfect except that it smells (like a jute smell) Fabrezed it twice.,56332,3
56332,Still smells after also airing it out since the day it arrived.,56332,3
56333,It says in the description to order a size up.,56333,3
56333,You should order 3 sizes up!,56333,3
56333,I wear an 8 or 10 and ordered an extra large and it fits snug.,56333,3
56334,I loved the feel very comfy.,56334,3
56334,My only complaint is I am 5'9 and there is no way I could wear as a dress.,56334,3
56334,For that reason It gets 3 stars,56334,3
56335,Looks much better on the picture.,56335,3
56336,It's a nice fashion dress.,56336,3
56337,The quality is average but the size is super small.,56337,3
56337,I normally wear an XL but ordered an XXL based on comments and it just barely fits.,56337,3
56338,Came badly damaged like the carrier had stepped on it high heels or something... A very detailed and good quality tardis was the only thing that made me give it more than one star.,56338,3
56339,The design is nice and quality is what I paid for.,56339,3
56339,However it was extremely small so small that I could not wear it and I had to donate it.,56339,3
56339,This was a waste of my money and time.,56339,3
56340,Its beautifull but its too small,56340,3
56341,Got a 29 normally fits perfect but these run a lititle big.,56341,3
56342,"I bought these in a size 6, and my feet are pretty spot on size 6.",56342,3
56342,"These fit, but they are very tight.",56342,3
56342,"There's no way to wear with socks, and if I don't wear socks then they rub blisters on my heels and my little toe.",56342,3
56342,"I tried the size 6.5 before buying these, but those flopped on my feet - too big.",56342,3
56342,I'm not sure what to say.,56342,3
56342,"I like the shoes and they look great, but they just don't fit well.",56342,3
56342,I can't suggest buying the right size or a size up because they just don't fit.,56342,3
56343,The earrings started peeling on the back after two wears.,56343,3
56343,I am concerned they are not made out of good materials and have not been wearing them.,56343,3
56345,"Material feels pretty cheap, but it has held up wear and tear wise.",56345,3
56345,We got what we paid for and it has lasted a little longer.,56345,3
56346,Fits a bit small but still ok.,56346,3
56346,Very thin material so need to wear a tank under it.,56346,3
56348,Was a little disappointed today as the black coloration was not done on the whole bracelet.,56348,3
56350,I kind of feel like I'm wearing a sheet sometimes though.,56350,3
56351,I love Camelia's Corsets...,56351,3
56351,"However, this sales place has got it all wrong.",56351,3
56351,The pic is not what I got.,56351,3
56351,I thought it was a longer version of what I had.,56351,3
56351,It was a bit shorter!,56351,3
56351,Plus the item had an odor that was not pleasant.,56351,3
56351,I did end up being able to wash the Corset but the smell is not al the way out.,56351,3
56351,The price was great!,56351,3
56351,However shipping was a bit high.,56351,3
56351,I am still looking for a longer corset.,56351,3
56352,it definitely runs small,56352,3
56353,The pearls appeared smaller in person and really light weight.,56353,3
56353,Worked for a costume but not overwhelmed with the quality.,56353,3
56354,"These claim to be 14-00g but they actual start at a 12g, meanwhile the size of the gauge, say the 00g is the actual size only about a third of the way into the spiral.",56354,3
56354,The rest of the spiral is much bigger.,56354,3
56354,I noticed this while trying to put in the 12g spirals and they burned quite a lot.,56354,3
56354,I then took the tunnels and they barely fit into the spiral.,56354,3
56355,The polarization doesn't seem to cover the full visible part of the spectrum.,56355,3
56355,"It works better on longer wavelengths, and as a consequence, reflections off of things -- off of water -- off of asphalt -- off of leaves appear to be blue.",56355,3
56355,"That might be fine for your purposes, but when I'm trying to go for a hike and enjoy nature, and I keep seeing blue leaves because the sun's hitting them, it feels weird.",56355,3
56356,Love the fit except it rides up as I run.,56356,3
56357,Runs small and looks a little cheap,56357,3
56358,Would have loved them if that weren't so small,56358,3
56359,The blouse was too small!,56359,3
56359,Other then that it was pretty!,56359,3
56360,Flower is too big,56360,3
56361,"not something I will buy again but its an ""ok"" buy.",56361,3
56362,Not really a rose gold tone more like a copper tone,56362,3
56363,The material is quite thin and requires layering to be decent.,56363,3
56364,I paid for this article in november.,56364,3
56364,"They no arrive in time, and the cloth look a little cheap.",56364,3
56365,Broke in like two seconds,56365,3
56366,I bought this as a tie for a Halloween costume.,56366,3
56366,It was acceptable for that purpose.,56366,3
56366,I wouldn't wear it to work.,56366,3
56367,This belt was sized small had to return for more accurate sized product.,56367,3
56368,The Chevron sparkles on the forearms are heavy and uncomfortable and the rest of it fits kind of small.,56368,3
56369,I received this product today and it's really very cute and seems to be relatively sturdy considering the low price.,56369,3
56369,"However, it did arrive with two stains on it.",56369,3
56369,"I sprayed it with Shout, let it sit for a bit and am now washing it.",56369,3
56369,Hopefully the stains come out.,56369,3
56369,"The fit is somewhat small is I bought the medium and am typically a small in dresses and it fits just right (5'8"" and 140 lbs).",56369,3
56369,"In addition, the waistline is somewhat higher than it appears in the picture.",56369,3
56370,Love the fabric but way to small!,56370,3
56371,It did not come inverted.,56371,3
56371,"The ""pvc"" necklace was made of cheap string.",56371,3
56371,I'll be buying from a different seller.,56371,3
56372,The shirt is a little short through the body.,56372,3
56372,Buying a 2X I had hoped it would be proportionately longer.,56372,3
56372,My husband will enjoy it in Cancun though!,56372,3
56373,This dress is longer than it looks.,56373,3
56373,"It's a nice material and I want to wear it but I'm 5'4"" and it falls half way down my shin",56373,3
56374,Didn't give the option to choose a color even both are ahown.,56374,3
56374,Color has worn off of the compass.,56374,3
56375,If you have wide feet this my not work for you but seems to be good quality.,56375,3
56376,It's smaller than I thought it was but It actually does as advertised.,56376,3
56377,"""One size fits all"", nope.",56377,3
56377,I'm 6'1 - 185.,56377,3
56377,It was far too small.,56377,3
56377,The legs stopped a good 5 inches from ankle.,56377,3
56377,Doesn't come with the show covers.,56377,3
56377,Complained to seller said costume doesn't come with those anymore.,56377,3
56377,Then they shouldn't be highlighted on packaging.,56377,3
56378,Nice shoes a little big but I should of tried them on before hand at the store.,56378,3
56380,Top is really small,56380,3
56381,It fits good and feels good,56381,3
56382,Shipping was rather fast considering the fact it came from China.,56382,3
56382,It was supposed to be her in October I got it September 15th!,56382,3
56382,It feels really nice and the fabric is decent.,56382,3
56382,I suggest ordering a size smaller so it has a kinda snug fit.,56382,3
56382,The padding inside is pointless cause it Dosent give any support so boob tape may be needed.,56382,3
56382,But overall I like,56382,3
56384,XXL was a large max,56384,3
56385,good material but small as was decribed,56385,3
56386,way high they look smaller in the photo..,56386,3
56387,Feels like paraxhute material but soft.,56387,3
56387,Disliked elastic band at bottom.,56387,3
56388,Not Maroon but red.,56388,3
56388,Very heavy but looks well made.,56388,3
56390,"Ok, very nice quality but a little small.",56390,3
56390,Overall I think it's cute,56390,3
56391,have not even used it and it already lost 1 rhinestone.,56391,3
56391,must have fallen off.,56391,3
56391,it did not come with any extra rhinestones.,56391,3
56392,was ok not quite the quality I expected but worked well on my bald head during chemo in the winter months.,56392,3
56393,I absolutely love them but the first time I put them on the crotch ripped.,56393,3
56393,They fit well otherwise but that was upsetting.,56393,3
56393,I'll sew them back up cause they are really cute but wasn't happy they ripped the first time,56393,3
56394,Blue is just ok!,56394,3
56395,it is worth the money,56395,3
56396,"Started falling apart, almost anything made the yarn come loose.",56396,3
56397,"The bathing suit itself is very pretty, looks to be good quality but way too small!",56397,3
56397,I have to return it and try to get a larger size.,56397,3
56397,I wish they had normal sizes like other companies.,56397,3
56397,Between the reviews and the description it was hard to guess.,56397,3
56397,Im 5'6 and 140lbs and got the small and it wasn't flattering.,56397,3
56398,My now wife is a woman that loves presentation and thoughtfulness.,56398,3
56398,She always puts a lot of details into the things she does.,56398,3
56398,When I popped the question I wanted it to be special and memorable.,56398,3
56398,This LED ring box gave the ring that extra flare I was looking for.,56398,3
56398,She loved the ring box as well the ring.,56398,3
56398,She loved how the LED light makes the ring gleam and glisten.,56398,3
56398,This is better than the cheap original ring box the ring came with.,56398,3
56398,Overall its just nicer and a very good cool idea.,56398,3
56398,It made the proposal just a bit more special.,56398,3
56398,"Sadly after a few months the ring box broke off on the hinge, and the switch that turned off the LED was out of alignment and thus keeping the LED on when not in use.",56398,3
56398,My wife said it just broke off without even being forceful.,56398,3
56398,It was nice while it lasted.,56398,3
56398,I recommend spending a little more on a higher quality box.,56398,3
56398,"You get what you pay for, thankfully it wasn't much.",56398,3
56399,Not exactly true to size,56399,3
56400,Just Dont like the material it looks like silk bed sheets,56400,3
56401,"Bottom fit, but top way too large, and too open on the sides",56401,3
56402,"Not heavy, real light weight around the neck.",56402,3
56402,"It's a simple touch, it compliments well.",56402,3
56402,"For the price, I cdnt ask for much more.",56402,3
56403,Small  there is no elastic band,56403,3
56404,Seemed okay but a bit too small despite ordering larger size.,56404,3
56404,Returned via UPS on Monday using Amazon label downloaded from you.,56404,3
56404,I intend to order a larger size.,56404,3
56405,"Looked nice at first, but the color came off almost instantly in the water.",56405,3
56405,"It wasn't too hot because I've bought from this seller before and it didn't come off that pair, and I heated the water to the same temperature.",56405,3
56405,I was satisfied with my other pair but I just wish I could get my money back on this one.,56405,3
56406,"Fit as expected, but a bit thinner than I hoped.",56406,3
56407,Very pretty but much larger than they look and much too heavy for me to wear.,56407,3
56408,"This ring is beautiful, and for that price you couldn't ask for anything better but over a little bit of time the little gems on the side start popping out which is unfortunate cause like I said the ring is beautiful.",56408,3
56408,Still it was worth the buy.,56408,3
56409,Seems kind of cheap if you know what I mean.,56409,3
56409,A little confusing to put on due to the way it's made,56409,3
56411,"First time fit great, after it keept rolling down.. have to pull it up to under my bra and holds it up with my bra lol crazy,  needles to say I've only b used it a few times.",56411,3

56415,I can not wear it.,56415,3
56416,Returned but was a beautiful dress.. Just too small,56416,3
56417,The product runs small.,56417,3
56417,They didn't want to hassle with a return so I was given a 5 dollar refund (was supposed to be 50%) but I paid more than 10 initially.,56417,3
56417,"So,  I don't know what happened.",56417,3
56417,"They were too tight and pinch your jewels,  according to the bf",56417,3
56418,It's super cute but it was somewhat too large for me.,56418,3
56418,I ordered the smallest size and it did not fit as snug as what it looks like in the pictures.,56418,3
56418,"I'm 5'2 at 120lbs so if you have a small frame, I don't recommend this for you as it will sag a bit.",56418,3
56419,"Nice earrings, too long.",56419,3
56419,Cut them back and now they are great,56419,3
56420,Great pair of white pants.,56420,3
56420,I didn't realize that my size was too short for tall sizes.,56420,3
56421,It is a high quality shirt but expect to wait a long time to get it.,56421,3
56422,"It's alright for the price ( I paid around $5)
I had low expectations because of the reviews but thought I'd give it a try since it was cheap.",56422,3
56422,"Lace and chiffon aren't completely matching, the sides are a little awkward but I guess I'll just save it for the bedroom or use it more like an extender slip..",56422,3
56423,"Kind of cheaply made, but they are super cheap, so I expected this much.",56423,3
56423,"They are tinted amber, so everything is like sepia-colored when you wear them.",56423,3
56423,Not a fan of that.,56423,3
56424,Cute just wish it wasn't itchy,56424,3
56425,"Product is beautiful, but the waist was too small and the rest too large.",56425,3
56425,It will need to be altered.,56425,3
56426,"Good looking jacket, but mine was cheaply made for sure.",56426,3
56426,"By the 2nd time I wore it, the inside seams at the top of the arms (yes BOTH arms) had come undone, so when I put the jacket on without looking my arm slides into the lining instead of the arm of the jacket.",56426,3
56426,Very disappointed but the outside looks ok so it does it's job when I'm outside and need a light jacket for work.,56426,3
56427,"I actually love this shirt, but it got two holes after being worn four times.",56427,3
56427,"I never used dryer, but I did use the washer on gentle.",56427,3
56427,the first hole was under the zipper the second on the side.,56427,3
56427,"I have small breasts and it is loose on me, so the holes are not from being too stretched.",56427,3
56427,But I can see how these holes would be huge if it was stretched.,56427,3
56430,Was pretty disappointed that the earing showed up with the studs bent downwards.,56430,3
56430,They mini mouse look is really cute though.,56430,3
56430,I had to bend them back into place.,56430,3
56431,Doesn't look as nice as in the pictures.,56431,3
56431,Smells like real leather.,56431,3
56432,It's a gift not sure of fit yet.,56432,3
56433,Went by size measurements.,56433,3
56433,It still does not fit the bust of a curvy woman.,56433,3
56433,Disappointed because I was careful to choose the size correctly.,56433,3
56434,The print is cute but the arms and neck were to big.,56434,3
56434,If you have broad shoulders this might fit you better.,56434,3
56435,"This is a cute bag and has a lovely pattern, but it is quite small and doesn't hold as many toiletries as I expected.",56435,3
56436,"cute but very thin and look very cheap ,I sewed some fur on them ,made them a little more presentable since I was giving them to my daughters for a little stocking stuffer .I was disappointed in them",56436,3
56437,The leg warmers are nice and come neatly packaged.,56437,3
56437,"However, they are a little big and seem to fall down.",56437,3
56437,A button was missing off the one of them.,56437,3
56437,I emailed the seller no response back yet.,56437,3
56438,"The lace was pretty, but this top was too stiff.",56438,3
56439,Much lower quality product than I expected.. Button broke off the whole strap within a week,56439,3
56440,The part that goes into my gps is to long.,56440,3
56440,"So, my gps doesn't recognize it very often.",56440,3
56441,Workmanship is just okay.,56441,3
56442,Dress was cheaply made.,56442,3
56442,I returned and got a full refund.,56442,3
56443,I ordered 2 pairs.,56443,3
56443,One pair was perfect.,56443,3
56443,The other looked like it was a returned item and the size was completely different and much smaller than the other pair of gloves I ordered.,56443,3
56443,It was a gift and so I was embarrassed when the gloves didn't fit the recipient.,56443,3
56444,"I don't think I will be fond of the fabric after a few wears, expect pilling",56444,3
56445,I ordered an xs for my daughter who is a size zero.,56445,3
56445,"Unfortunately it was way too large, and I had to pay an extra $50 to have it altered.",56445,3
56445,It looked beautiful on her once it fit correctly.,56445,3
56446,I like the white ones.,56446,3
56446,They are the most accurate to the pictures.,56446,3
56446,The green is bright in the pics but are so dark it's hard to tell they are green.,56446,3
56446,"The brownish ones in the pics are dark but they are more of a Carmel, hazel color IRL.",56446,3
56447,Cute but gave to my son who is 9.,56447,3
56448,"The product arrived in good time for Christmas, and the gift itself is one the recipient will appreciate.",56448,3
56448,"However, the letters on one side were not fully engraved, making the quote difficult to read.",56448,3
56449,runs smaller than any others of this brand.,56449,3
56450,This gets three stars because of cuteness and warmth.,56450,3
56450,I was SO excited to find dinosaur pajamas for my baby girl.,56450,3
56450,I hand washed and hung dry before she wore them.,56450,3
56450,"After the second night I noticed her big toe peeking out of the foot, and she's not even crawling yet!",56450,3
56450,Super cute idea but very poor quality.,56450,3
56451,The buckle is much lighter than anticipated.,56451,3
56452,"Nice looking boot, but too big, unfortunately.",56452,3
56453,No protection to the front of the phone.,56453,3
56454,"Looked fine,  but son complained instantly when he tried them on.",56454,3
56456,I no longer have this product it's really basic and I found out I needed and wanted more from my tracker.,56456,3
56456,The real plus is that it is waterproof and you can swim with it.,56456,3
56457,OK but too small for my son.,56457,3
56457,He used it as part of Halloween Custume.,56457,3
56458,It looks a lil weird!,56458,3
56459,It's not terrible quality.,56459,3
56459,But the skin on your thighs needs to be TIGHT for this to remotely look good.,56459,3
56459,I had a significant weight loss and my butt just droops over the back of it and it looks awful.,56459,3
56460,"I was disappointed it was kind of a pink gold, I was hoping for more of a yellow gold.",56460,3
56460,But it fits and I'm content.,56460,3

56461,Liked it except jordan is underneath the arm so no one can see.,56461,3
56461,Other then that its good.,56461,3
56462,"It is, however, higher waisted than the photo potrays - the empire waist comes up to just under the bust line.",56462,3
56462,"Fabric is a bit more casual looking then I expected, and a little on the thin side, but, with the proper undergarments it would be fine.",56462,3
56463,I bought a small and it's somewhat of a loose fit.,56463,3
56463,"If you are looking for something that will be figure-hugging, then you will be disappointed.",56463,3
56463,"However, you can easily pair it with a pair of skin jeans and it will look nice.",56463,3
56463,The material is good for the price.,56463,3

56464,I just wish it looked more like the picture.,56464,3
56465,"I give this top 3 stars, only because it runs small.",56465,3
56465,The colors are beautiful and the cut is curvy so it's comfortable.,56465,3
56466,It fits a little bit smaller than I expected but it's good and the only thing that bothered me was that it's more like a dressing shirt kind of type or like one of those exercise short type fabric.i ordered the black one and the dots on the strawberry where white and also the outline.i ordered a medium,56466,3
56467,"I'm usually medium and got a medium, however, should have gotten large it's snug in the bottoms and top fits kinda awkward.",56467,3
56468,Order at least one size up.,56468,3

56484,"Cute pants, i thought the mesh would be a little more see through.",56484,3
56484,Kind of disappointed with that because I love mesh detail.,56484,3
56484,They fit well and the pocket is nice.,56484,3
56484,They are high wasted as well.,56484,3
56485,Great for a beach cover up.,56485,3
56485,Too sheer to wear out though,56485,3
56486,"Very thin and stiff material, and the fit is really, really small (even more than I'm used to with small-running-sized clothing).",56486,3
56486,"As of now I can't even begin to fit into it, and I don't know if it's even worth keeping around to find out if losing a few pounds will help.",56486,3
56487,From the waist down the product is not as shown in the picture.,56487,3
56487,It is far less impressive than expected :(,56487,3
56488,Bottoms were a perfect fit but top was so stiffly molded that it was uncomfortable.,56488,3
56488,The top was also way too big.,56488,3
56488,Did not match sizing of bottoms.,56488,3
56489,This definitely runs small so order a size up!,56489,3
56489,I'm 5'6 130 and I ordered a M which was to small for me!,56489,3
56489,Other than that the print is gorgeous just like the pictures.,56489,3
56490,The metal caused itching.,56490,3
56490,I am wondering if the bar is hypoallergic but what holds the gems in place isn't.,56490,3
56491,"A pretty ring, but very tight.",56491,3
56491,"I purchased a size 6, and it fits more tightly than a traditional size 5.",56491,3
56491,Go up a size when you order.,56491,3
56492,Great for keeping the sun off your head.,56492,3
56492,Would have been 5 stars but hat is not that durable.,56492,3
56492,After wearing just a few times the hat has a few broken straw parts but is still wearable.,56492,3
56492,Other than that fit is as expected and does its job.,56492,3
56493,The shirt is nice but the tie is a piece of garbage.,56493,3
56493,"The tie is very thin and is all distorted, the Velcro on the back will not even stay put so I had to put pins on the back and under the tie just to make it work.",56493,3
56495,My biggest complaint is the large Y&G gold logo that's painfully obvious to anyone you're talking to that you want to give your business card too.,56495,3
56495,"I guess I shouldn't complain for the price I paid for this, you get what you pay for I guess.",56495,3
56495,"It works, but starts to fall apart after a couple weeks.",56495,3
56495,"I know it isn't that expensive, but I still expected a little longer life.",56495,3
56495,"I carry business cards with me all the time, mostly in the back pocket of whatever pants I'm wearing.",56495,3
56495,This fits an adequate amount of cards.,56495,3
56495,I plan to find another card holder without a cheesy logo on the flap and keep this as a backup to carry more cards or to keep some in my car or something.,56495,3
56495,"In hindsight, I probably would've passed on this and spent a little more for a cleaner looking business card holder.",56495,3
56495,First impressions can matter greatly when you're in sales.,56495,3
56496,"Way to small
Fabric ok your average swim wear fabric
I am a 40 C and could not zip up over my chest
Love the pattern and style
Just wished it would have fit",56496,3
56497,i like how it looks.,56497,3
56497,i feel so delicate and fairy like in it but i can't wear it outside.,56497,3
56497,its far too transparent and big.,56497,3
56497,"couldn't pull it off without tightening the whole dress, a slip and a jacket.",56497,3
56498,Collar was way too tight.,56498,3
56499,0-12 months is a REALLY wide range.,56499,3
56501,"Nice , just the bottom it's kind of small!",56501,3
56502,"I order larger than normal and it was small when it got here, the.",56502,3
56502,I washed it and it got even smaller.,56502,3
56502,I usually wear a medium/large and I ordered the largest one available.,56502,3
56502,So do not order of you usually wear a large or x-large.,56502,3
56503,Not bad but chain that connects doesn't allow for several charms to be placed on bracelet due to weight.,56503,3
56503,Recommend getting different claps.,56503,3
56504,These socks fit me and the design is awesome!,56504,3
56504,Only issue is that these are very cheaply made - I can see my skin through the socks.,56504,3
56504,"So while there are no holes yet, I'm pretty sure I'll make the holes within 2 or 3 more wears, unfortunately.",56504,3
56505,Was to saggy in the crotch area....,56505,3
56505,I'm normally a Medium and these sizes are crazy.,56505,3
56505,I bet if I exchanged for a size smaller it would have worked.,56505,3
56505,Was super adorable and slimming for sure!,56505,3
56506,Turned dark really fast and fingers green.,56506,3
56507,"I thought they would be in gauges but all the sizes are displayed in mm, so I had to try to figure out the conversions from where I started when putting in the first set.",56507,3
56507,The quality is pretty cheap.,56507,3
56507,When cleaning my ears with alcohol it strips the smooth coating and turns them white.,56507,3
56507,I was wearing one of the plugs with holes and after two days one of the backs completely shattered.,56507,3
56507,"I rated this three stars because you get a lot of variety lot for the money but the quality is poor, so I guess you get what you pay for.",56507,3
56508,I originally ordered a small according to size chart.,56508,3
56508,"If you have a plump bottom, order a size up!",56508,3
56508,"I could see the small fitting according to size chart if you have a small behind, otherwise no way!",56508,3
56508,I exchanged for a medium.,56508,3
56508,I didn't like that it had no padding on it which is why I took stars off.,56508,3
56508,"But, I mainly bought the swim suit for the bottom which is why I kept it.",56508,3
56508,The quality - I liked the material and didn't look cheap.,56508,3
56508,It is also a very nice color red.,56508,3
56509,"I liked the fabric and the length of the dress,  but I did not like the way it was cut in the front .",56509,3
56509,The cut  curves in towards the breast instead of being cut straight .,56509,3
56509,"I am 5'4"", 140 pounds  and the dress was not that flow-y.",56509,3
56509,"I guess  One size fits all is only for 5'2"", 100 pound people",56509,3
56510,Good for only a few wears,56510,3
56511,"The stones are gorgeous, and the color ideal.",56511,3
56511,"However, the elastic band has already weakened and started breaking after just one month of use:(",56511,3
56512,Brown is not as advertised.,56512,3
56512,Color is way off,56512,3
56513,My Dad is a Vietnam Vet.,56513,3
56513,I researched these for months before deciding on this one.,56513,3
56513,"It looks like the 1968-68 field jacket with a few improvements that make it more functional, mainly it doesn't soak up water like a sponge and inner pockets.",56513,3
56513,"It's supposed to be lighter than the original as well, and even so - this one is 4lbs.",56513,3
56513,I didn't give it 5 stars because the sizing on this doesn't have the correct hip measurement.,56513,3
56513,"Long story short - the chest, shoulders, and arms do run 2 sizes too big, but the hips and waist are about one size too big, which makes the midline of the jacket narrow.",56513,3
56513,"If you carry more weight through your middle, order 1 size smaller than your street clothes.",56513,3
56513,I ordered a size M for a man who normally wears an XL.,56513,3
56513,Exchanged it for a L. Hoping its not huge everywhere else now.,56513,3
56514,The button is too narrow,56514,3
56515,Returned for larger size which I'm waiting to receive.,56515,3
56515,Seller seems easy to work with so far.,56515,3
56516,"Cute, but tight on my 2 year olds head.",56516,3
56516,"Not sure how this is supposed to fit up to 10 years old, as stated in the description.",56516,3
56518,Ordered a women's large fit like a child's large,56518,3
56519,was not the color I expected.,56519,3
56519,still wearing it though.,56519,3
56520,It was much larger than expected.,56520,3
56521,The color is not rose gold.,56521,3
56521,It's more like a yellow gold with a faint hint of rose.,56521,3
56521,The clear stones are unnaturally large.,56521,3
56521,These are unique earrings and aren't terrible to look at so I gave them 3 stars rather than 2.,56521,3
56521,Just don't expect them to look like the picture.,56521,3
56523,"Run small and narrow
Get a half a size bigger
Cute boots tho",56523,3
56524,fits jr sizes not womens.,56524,3
56525,I love the material but the dress is way too big on the chest and strap area.,56525,3
56525,"I bought one my size, and it showed too much of my chest.",56525,3
56525,"I bought a second one a size smaller, and it kept falling off of my shoulders and showing my chest.",56525,3
56526,I don't like the Eovin Klein monogram inside the vest.,56526,3
56527,This was cute and colorful - it worked well for a gift for an acquaintance (Christmas).,56527,3
56527,"Kind of poor quality, but she liked it.",56527,3
56528,My husband is a firefighter and wears this when he works out or is at work.,56528,3
56528,We have noticed it leaves a weird funk on his finger from the sweat and moisture.,56528,3
56529,They are a little tight!,56529,3
56530,It was nice but it came with a small hole.,56530,3
56531,"Not exactly what I expected, low quality material and",56531,3
56532,"Nice dress, but it didn't fit as expected",56532,3
56533,"It was pretty, but nothing like what the picture looks.",56533,3
56533,It barely reaches her waist and the crochet pieces are not sewn to the shirt around the edges.,56533,3
56533,"She liked it too much for me to send it back, plus I figured the return process wasn't worth it.",56533,3
56533,I will not be ordering clothes again from this company.,56533,3
56534,It came in the wrong size and it's not cleanly cut.,56534,3
56534,"Other than that, it's pretty OK.",56534,3
56535,Thinner than i'd like.,56535,3
56535,Half of the batch shrunk a good 2-3 inches down my calf so now i have two different sizes.,56535,3
56536,"Fits small, one size fits most..",56536,3
56537,The red was a size bigger than the other two.,56537,3
56537,All three were HUGE.,56537,3
56537,The material was thin.,56537,3
56537,I ordered XL like the chart suggested (I usually wear a M) and these did not fit at all.,56537,3
56537,"I could reorder a smaller size, but I didn't like the feel of the thin material.",56537,3
56537,It felt hot against my skin.,56537,3
56537,"Even in a smaller size I don't think this would count as ""compression"".",56537,3
56538,It was ok.the color is much more paler than what it looks in picture...love the sleeves though.,56538,3
56539,"Love the look, but the spandex shorts under the skirt don't hold well.",56539,3
56539,They end up riding up constantly.,56539,3
56540,"These fit a bit looser than I expected, and were quite tall.",56540,3
56540,I returned them just because I didn't love the style and loose fit.,56540,3
56540,"They were well made, however.",56540,3
56540,I think that I am just not a big enough fan of leg warmers.,56540,3
56541,"Decent product, feels a bit cheap.",56541,3
56543,The necklace was broken upon receiving it.,56543,3
56543,I looked wonderful on the model.,56543,3
56543,I will have to find some parts to fix it.,56543,3
56543,I should have sent it back but decided to keep it and see if I can fix it.,56543,3
56544,Love the amber but charm is very tiny.,56544,3
56544,Also the silver is very thin and was bent when received.,56544,3
56544,Metal so thin I was able to bend it back into shape with tweezers.,56544,3
56544,Will not where too often...,56544,3
56545,"i am 140LBS 5'8"" B cup with small to average size hips and booty and a long torso.",56545,3
56545,The center vertical strap was just a little on the short side for my torso and it was pulling at the top to make my mom boobs look even more saggy lol the horizontal strap was a bit too tight on my waist.,56545,3
56545,so i cut the straps and made a regular bikini lol good quality of material.,56545,3
56547,"Love the material, it feels really smothes against the skin.",56547,3
56547,I just didn't like it riding up all the time.,56547,3
56547,If they can fix that issue you will have a winner.,56547,3
56549,the dress is very pretty!,56549,3
56549,"however, it states the length would be long enough for my 5.11 height, so, just to be safe i ordered up a size, it was still tooooooo short.",56549,3
56549,wouldn't recommend for 5.9 and above heights,56549,3
56550,"Very cute, but when I unpacked it I noticed a few loose strings and the waist band was coming off.",56550,3
56550,"Not to much of a problem, since I could sew it back on, but a bit of an annoyance.",56550,3
56550,The skirt was also short on me.,56550,3
56550,Might have just been how tall I am though.,56550,3
56550,Overall I still like it.,56550,3
56551,Liked them overall they run small and are not as long as expected the colors were way off on 2 of the 6 I ordered.,56551,3
56551,the royal blue was navy blue and the orange was a yellowish orange very light colored.,56551,3
56551,The white black coral and fascia were spot on with the colors.,56551,3
56551,But still like them.,56551,3
56552,Cute but to big,56552,3
56553,small but not bad.,56553,3
56554,I received these shorts as a discount for my honest and unbiased review.,56554,3
56554,"I always wanted a pair of these in my closet, so when i saw this deal I couldn't pass it up.",56554,3
56554,"Some information on the shorts:
S length 18CM Waist 68CM Hip 88CM hem / trousers 50CM

XXL length 18CM Waist 76CM Hip 96CM hem / trousers 54CM  <--- what I ordered, I am a size 6.",56554,3
56554,"Cotton, Spandex
Machine Wash
Waist Type:Low/Pant Style:Cross-pant
Thickness:Standard

I looked at the reviews before ordering and everyone said to order a couple sizes up.",56554,3
56554,I'm normally a size 6 so i got an XXL to make sure that they were not to tight.,56554,3
56554,When I put then on the just fit.,56554,3
56554,they are not something that I would wear out in public because they are just a little to tight.,56554,3
56554,"However, I am losing weight so they are fitting better.",56554,3
56554,The shorts will look better depending on your body type.,56554,3
56554,"If you have a smaller butt, they will look nice, because of how the pocket size looks.",56554,3
56554,Mine is a bit bigger so they look so-so.,56554,3
56554,For about 10 dollars they are not bad.,56554,3
56555,"I purchased this in a Medium, (I am typically a size Small) due to the measurements provided.",56555,3
56555,"I found the measurements to be extremely off, in places I would think fit perfectly were too big (i.e.",56555,3
56555,"bust area) it was extremely difficult to get on and off, but besides that it is very well made and a gorgeous piece.",56555,3
56556,"Not the best quality,  but  a great prop nonetheless",56556,3
56557,"Does not completely look as it does in the picture shown; however, it still wearable.",56557,3
56558,Didn't care for this.,56558,3
56558,"It's ok, but nothing special",56558,3
56559,This is thin cotton but it is good for the warm months!,56559,3
56560,But its on a smaller side.,56560,3
56560,I wish i ordered size up.,56560,3
56561,"Color is not what is shown, quality was not as expected.",56561,3
56562,the sleeves were to short,56562,3
56563,Not great stitching on the seams,56563,3
56564,I only wear this bra when my others aren't available.,56564,3
56564,I'm a 34 C and a medium is too big.,56564,3
56564,The cups that come out are a big pain as they get folded and smooshed when taking the bra off to nurse.,56564,3
56564,I finally just took them out.,56564,3
56565,"Material is more like that of a table cloth, not a very flattering fit",56565,3
56566,Cute but made of cheap material,56566,3
56567,This item is not as pictured.,56567,3
56567,The quality is good but the colors were not as pictured and unappealing for a little boy,56567,3
56568,the top looks better in the picture fits like a sports bra bottoms are like a thong So I am returning this item,56568,3
56569,Looks cute and I like the material.,56569,3
56569,The top part of the dress fits nicely but the bottom half seems a little too big/poofy.,56569,3
56569,I wouldn't wear it on its on because it makes you look bottom heavy... definitely would wear a long cardigan to minimize that.,56569,3
56570,"I liked the ski mask, I bought it to replace an old one that I had boughten at a gas station.",56570,3
56570,"It is Thick which is not what I expected, even though it is in the title.",56570,3
56570,I would have preferred a thin tight snug one but it should keep you warm if that is what it is needed for.,56570,3
56570,The only thing I did not like was how there was a bump on the corner of the stitches up at the top so i am going to try and wash it or iron them down so my head will look more rounded.,56570,3
56571,I ordered large & fit like a normal small size.,56571,3
56573,Runs very small and not the quality I wanted.,56573,3
56574,"Beautiful earrings for the cost, however the back peg broke off after only a month of use.",56574,3
56574,My daughter was pretty bummed out.,56574,3
56575,"A bit small for me, nicely made.",56575,3
56575,"Was afraid to enlarge the opening, as I wasn't sure if they might break.",56575,3
56575,Would have been 5 stars if they fit.,56575,3
56576,The pads do not come out of this suit.,56576,3
56576,I assumed from what I had read that they did.,56576,3
56576,Fit as expected if you read what size to get.,56576,3
56577,So I got a black pair and charcoal gray the black ones were smaller than the gray but they fit the thing that kinda upset me is that it they are Capri pants and they aren't they got to my ankles which I wanted Capri pants they onl yway i can geth them to be capris is by folding them or pulling them way high up over my belly button,56577,3
56578,Comfortable but you should get 2 sizes bigger than what you normally get,56578,3
56579,Wife loved the suit but was to large for the size stated??,56579,3
56580,"Runs pretty small, but I don't plan on wrapping it around until it closes.",56580,3
56581,I love these but they shrunk when I washed them.,56581,3
56582,"It was too small, had to return/exchange.",56582,3
56583,"Let me first state: I am 5'2"" and 104 pounds.",56583,3
56583,My butt/hips are 35 inches and my waist is 26.,56583,3
56583,"I got a size small, since usually I fit into asian sizes like that.",56583,3
56583,This skirt was super difficult to get on past my butt (apparently too big for asia) and rested on my waist and part of my ribcage.,56583,3
56583,The skirt doesn't cover my butt.,56583,3
56583,"The skirt is actually made out of surprisingly sturdy material though, so I'm thinking I can probably alter it to make the zipper longer/ widen the skirt.",56583,3
56583,"It's a really pretty color and I like the knife pleats, I'll make it work, I guess.",56583,3
56584,"For the price, I wasn't expecting the world.",56584,3
56584,"This fits a bit tight on me, but I saw no size choices available (one size fits all).",56584,3
56585,This fit bigger than I thought.,56585,3
56585,The suit was nice.,56585,3
56585,Material was substantial and colors were vivid.,56585,3
56585,It was too long for my body or I would have reordered a smaller size.,56585,3
56585,It also is a deeper plunge in the front than I am comfortable with wearing.,56585,3
56586,"I'm size L,
According  your chart..",56586,3
56586,I ordered size XL.....too small.,56586,3
56586,As they look very nice I'll try the XXl.,56586,3
56587,"plastic neck, ropes weren't thick enough to my liking, looks cheesy and cheap in person",56587,3
56589,"Looks good, but fits small.",56589,3
56590,"My husband I'd 6' 3"" and weighs 245 pounds and has very muscular legs from biking for over 20 years.",56590,3
56590,I bought him the XL and they are tight in the waist and legs.,56590,3
56590,I would suggest buying a size larger than the size chart tells you.,56590,3
56591,"It was NOT stitched properly, and had to be mended, befor it could be worn",56591,3
56592,It is a great shirt but thinner than expected,56592,3
56594,"Pretty piece, but I agree with the other reviews, picture is blurry and hard to make out.",56594,3
56594,"For the price can't expect perfection, get what cha pay for ;)",56594,3
56595,"Cute pendants, but the chain started to tarnish after 3 uses.",56595,3
56595,You get what you pay for I guess.,56595,3
56596,"The shirt is cute and s rich color, but smaller than the size should be.",56596,3
56597,Does not look like the picture,56597,3
56598,These stayed on fine.,56598,3
56598,They didn't fall out at all.,56598,3
56598,The bottom was comfortable and didn't really mess with my speach.,56598,3
56598,The top ones were awful.,56598,3
56598,They were WAYYYYY too big for my mouth.,56598,3
56598,The size and height of the teeth were huge.,56598,3
56598,I couldn't talk with the top teeth in.,56598,3
56598,They worked for my costume.,56598,3
56599,This product would get a better review from me if the color was represented better and the sizing was accurate.,56599,3
56599,"Usually, I wear an XL or 12-14, bust size 38DD.",56599,3
56599,"From previous experience with Doublju tops, I ordered the XXL.",56599,3
56599,It fit perfectly when I ordered the size larger.,56599,3
56599,"Unfortunately, the Cream color was more of a light pastel yellow than what is pictured.",56599,3
56599,"Even though I returned it, I really liked the length and feel.",56599,3
56599,"It would look good as a short dress if you dare, or with leggings to be more conservative.",56599,3
56599,I'll probably order in a different color.,56599,3
56600,Too tight on hips but great shaped bottom,56600,3
56601,My baby is almost 5 months old and is in the 50th percentile for growth.,56601,3
56601,The suit is way to large for him sadly because it is very cute.,56601,3
56602,Not great quality and smaller fit than expected.,56602,3
56603,Thin and not as well made as other Burts bees sleepers that I have purchased,56603,3
56604,These are really cute shoes however they were a little tight on my foot and ankle.,56604,3
56605,Runs kind of small.,56605,3
56606,I wear a size US small and ordered a large after reading reviews.,56606,3
56606,"While it does fit around my body very well, it's very short and the arms are 3/4 sleeves.",56606,3
56606,I could have ordered another size up and it would have fit well.,56606,3
56606,The quality is good though.,56606,3
56606,Just the sizing is very small.,56606,3
56607,Bottoms are CUTE & SEXY!!,56607,3
56607,Top is TOO LARGE!!,56607,3
56607,"Not
Excited about the top...",56607,3
56608,Loved the color but it wasn't as slouchy as I thought it would be.,56608,3
56609,Love this necklace and always receive compliments when I wear it.,56609,3
56609,However a part broke off the first time wearing it.,56609,3
56609,The quality of the neclsce is not very good.,56609,3
56610,I'm DM's daughter and I bought these so I could have a nose ring without the commitment.,56610,3
56610,"While the rings were good quality, they were much too big for my nose.",56610,3
56610,It just didn't compliment me at all.,56610,3
56610,I would recommend though!,56610,3
56611,Shoulder straps are too far out and they are falling off my shoulders,56611,3
56612,I am normally a 6.5/for almost every shoe brand and.sometimes even a 6.,56612,3
56612,"However, this shoe ran about a half size too small and is very narrow.",56612,3
56612,Next time I would order a size 7 and wide if possible.,56612,3
56612,But the memory foam is very comfortable,56612,3
56613,My daughter is 3 and has a normal size head and these are a bit tight for her.,56613,3
56613,But come in the cutest case.,56613,3
56613,They seem study too.,56613,3
56613,But she won't wear because of the size.,56613,3
56613,They are nor as flexible as they seem to imply.,56613,3
56614,"It's very cute but it's much larger than I thought it would be, maybe I missed the measurements or they meant nothing to my anti-math brain..",56614,3
56614,It's about the size and weight of a US quarter.,56614,3
56614,"Well, a little heavier than a quarter actually.",56614,3
56614,"The piece of metal holding the charm to the chain does not seem like it will last long but since it's heavy, I'll probably notice if it breaks while I'm wearing it.",56614,3
56614,The little happy sun does make me smile.,56614,3
56614,I got one for one of my favs and she loved it!,56614,3
56614,The few things I consider flaws are in line with price and bulk quantity manufacturing.,56614,3
56615,I loved this shirt when it came it was very nice fabric too.,56615,3
56615,After a month though with wear and washing the design peeled off.,56615,3
56615,So I am going to have to find a new type o negative shirt.,56615,3
56616,"Well, I had to rebuild it from pieces because it fell apart when I first used it.",56616,3
56616,"That being said, after building it, it's been great and helped me adjust the bands on two watches now.",56616,3
56616,In the photo you will see the part stuck in my watch (easily removed with pliers).,56616,3
56616,"All in all, it's a decent product but, well, you get what you pay for.",56616,3
56617,For my Wife... She stated it ran really small but she would manage...,56617,3
56617,"It did it's job but.. She had to order a new and different brand cause one of the ""bones"" came out and just folds over now and their wasn't enough of them to began with.",56617,3
56617,But you do get what you pay for and It wasn't a bad deal.,56617,3
56618,Was roo tight for the mentioned size,56618,3
56619,"has a sharp piece on the inside of shoe , back of heal that is cutting into my Achilles .....",56619,3
56620,"It fits fine, but the fabric is very itchy.",56620,3
56621,The material feels like a soft towel.,56621,3
56621,The slippers have very thick bottoms but they do include the non-slip grip underneath.,56621,3
56622,"Nothing wrong with the shoe it's actually a beautiful shoe, other than just too small for my foot...I have wide feet which I could wear them",56622,3
56624,"The extra pair of gold earrings are very pretty, but impossible for me to wear.",56624,3
56624,The piece going through the ear was so big that it actually hurt to put them on.,56624,3
56624,"Am still deciding if I like the large part of the earring in the back, but these are very pretty earrings.",56624,3
56625,The two straps on the bottom; one was much too tight and the other way too loose.,56625,3
56626,It's a good wallet..it serves its purpose but is not what I expected.,56626,3
56626,Could of been made with better material but good enough.,56626,3
56627,With a fabric that stretches very easily I was a bit disappointed that this top ran as large as it does.,56627,3
56627,Compared to the other Doublju products this top is definitely a size or two larger than you'd normally wear.,56627,3
56627,I purchased this to wear with pencil skirts and the length meets my needs.,56627,3
56627,The fabric is thinner and if you're choosing a light color than be cautious of the possibility of things being seen through.,56627,3
56627,"In my case, when I wear it with a pencil skirt you can see the skirt through the shirt material.",56627,3
56628,So many ppl loved it but the material I wore this to my niece's high school graduation but by the time the ceremony was over I noticed small holes in the front of it I'm like  what happened who knows but oh well loved the color anyway.,56628,3
56629,The shoes are very beautiful but they run very big.,56629,3
56630,"It was the perfect size for the most part, but the band was just way too tight.",56630,3
56630,I could barely zip the bra closed and within a few minutes the band was leaving painful marks on my skin and was hurting my chest way too much.,56630,3
56630,"I'm an active athlete and have various sports bras, none of them have ever been an issue like this before and they're all relatively the same size.",56630,3
56630,I can't go through my usual workout or run with the B.,56630,3
56630,"Bang, because it's just too tight!",56630,3
56631,Pants and shirt are pretty thin material.,56631,3
56632,The shirt is cute.,56632,3
56632,It fits well but the placement of the elbow patch is very weird it is located more on my forearm than my elbow.,56632,3
56632,And the patch color is very off too.,56632,3
56632,It's not brown it is more tan.,56632,3
56632,Not a bad deal for only $12.,56632,3
56633,Came way sooner then expected.,56633,3
56633,Its a little baggy.,56633,3
56633,I got a small feels more of a medium to me.,56633,3
56633,The colors are vibrant and pattern matches that of in the picture.,56633,3
56633,Overall good buy for the price :),56633,3
56634,"Nice top, but the fit is large.",56634,3
56636,The bottom of my waist measures at a 39 the middle of my waist a 36 and the top of my waist a 34.,56636,3
56636,I am 5'6 and 197lbs but I am a size 36DDD so I am not big at all I just have huge boobs BUT non of the vest trainers fit my the XL is to small the 2XL is creasing IN the middle of my back making it hard for me to sit down and be comfortable and the 3XL in general is entirely to big!!,56636,3
56636,Ugh I'm so fustrated!!,56636,3
56636,I need something that's going to be comfortable and suck my love handles in!!,56636,3
56637,"The underwear was very soft and I loved it, but when I washed them, they shrunk considerably.",56637,3
56637,I would have ordered a bigger size had I known.,56637,3
56637,Shipping was fast and on time.,56637,3
56638,Nice print but didn't like material was thicker than expected.,56638,3
56638,Nice dres though just not for me wanted for summer.,56638,3
56639,Excellent material y design but size is smaller than expected.,56639,3
56640,Like the design but it is not a cotton blend sweatshirt .,56640,3
56640,It is more performance hoodie with a shinny finish .,56640,3
56640,100% polyester not cotton blend that is why it is getting 3 stars - not happy with the fabric,56640,3
56641,I think this runs in chinese size because I'm 2xl in size and it cant even get up on my legs.,56641,3
56641,i ordered 2xl but it doesn't fit so i'm disappointed in the product sizing.,56641,3
56642,I thought this piece of jewelry was really cute!,56642,3
56642,The only problem I had was that it made my belly button piercing itch and get a little irritated.,56642,3
56642,"But, overall, I thought that this ring was adorable and fun to wear.",56642,3
56642,I would recommend not sleeping in it or keeping it on over night.,56642,3
56642,"I never did, but because it is not made out of the correct metal, it could possibly cause infection or skin irritation.",56642,3
56642,Hope this was helpful!,56642,3
56643,Doesn't exactly fit quite nice.,56643,3
56644,It is almost too big for a front pocket.,56644,3
56644,It has a lot of wasted space in the wallet.,56644,3
56645,I ordered a size large for my husband and it looks like a medium.,56645,3
56645,It also has a funny sour smell to it when I took it out of the packaging.,56645,3
56646,Order 2 sizes larger than your normal size!,56646,3
56646,"I am a size 6 (5'4"", 130lbs) but ordered a medium, based on reviews, and it definitely does not fit like the pic!",56646,3
56646,"It is a little loose, but not as long or loose as the pic.",56646,3
56647,"The faux leather is starting to fade ,crack a bit and I will not buy this type of product again.",56647,3
56648,"They are a little ""hard"" and don't fit like any other New Balance I've owned.",56648,3
56649,The top didn't fit at all... and I can sometimes fit in girls medium clothing... but the shorts are cute and I am wearing them as bed shorts,56649,3
56650,"Good value, silk is thin, jersey-type weave rather than satin, a little short in the body but not a lot.",56650,3
56650,Otherwise looks and fits as shown.,56650,3
56651,Was on time leather good,56651,3
56652,I'm usually a small/ medium but I ordered a large and it fit a little snug still but not too bad.,56652,3
56653,Looks exactly like pictures.,56653,3
56653,I would have given more starts if they didn't start to pill after washing them.,56653,3
56655,"Good piercing kit, bad quality jewerly.",56655,3
56656,Product needs to have separate sizing for top an bottom.,56656,3
56656,"I bought it fo my wife and she loved the top, but the bottoms were way to small.",56656,3
56656,She is rather buxom and usually has the opposite problem.,56656,3
56656,They were kind enough to send separate sizing once I contacted them.,56656,3
56657,"Material is okay, but it's too big.",56657,3
56657,I'm 154lbs I have small waist so I got a XS and i was able to put it on the first hook.,56657,3
56657,I will probably exchange it for XXS,56657,3
56658,"A little smaller than I thought, but still super cute!",56658,3
56658,It will make a great spring/summer purse,56658,3
56660,"sizes run small ordered a medium and it was to small, but it is actually a really good quality t shirt for the price.",56660,3
56660,other than the size issue i would totally purchase this again,56660,3
56661,the size runs very large.,56661,3
56662,they seem to be well made but it was defiantly made bigger than my daughter's normal size.,56662,3
56662,I had to send them back.,56662,3
56662,However I have ordered a size smaller and I hope they work better.,56662,3
56663,I ordered the medium because that's what the size chart said.,56663,3
56663,It was way too big for me to wear.,56663,3
56663,I should have ordered a small or maybe even gotten by with x-small but I'll keep it.,56663,3
56663,I might can use it for something.,56663,3
56664,"Usually I good with picking the right size, but this time this shirt was too small for my bust.",56664,3
56664,"I tried to follow the sizing chart and got the Xlarge per the measurements for 38 bust, but did not work out.",56664,3
56664,Oh well still a cute shirt overall will have to regift it.,56664,3
56665,"Fits nicely, but rides up your butt and crotch a lot.",56665,3
56665,"If move a little and you'll have to dig it out, unless that's the look you're going for.",56665,3
56665,It was cheap and looked like the picture.,56665,3
56665,The fabric was pretty thin and the string to lace up yourself was really long.,56665,3
56666,Super cute but runs big,56666,3
56667,Beautiful for the price but the arms seem large and I have larger arms than most :(,56667,3
56668,The zipper is put in for left-handed people.,56668,3
56668,Trim is not great.,56668,3
56668,Don't think too highly of their quality.,56668,3
56669,Returned because the closure in the back is just a lace up and one person cannot do it.,56669,3
56669,The bodice was somewhat small on my chest.,56669,3
56669,"Lovely material, the dress is beautiful.",56669,3
56670,It is bigger than described but the quality is good,56670,3
56671,Very nice but would have preferred it to have a belt or some sort of a front closure.,56671,3
56672,"not very strong material, but they are very  stretchy, and pretty cute.",56672,3
56673,"Its see through so if you have anything written on your phone, it will show.",56673,3
56674,The arms and under the arms seems to run small.,56674,3
56674,The other portions were great.,56674,3
56674,I hope it's not gonna shrink when its washed.,56674,3
56674,The color on-line was not the color of the shirt.,56674,3
56674,"Listed as a pink watermelon, it's very much a orangy melon color.",56674,3
56675,it is way bigger than what it looks in the picture..,56675,3
56676,"Liked the hat, just needed protection from the sun (which it did) and needed the heat kept away.",56676,3
56676,If my head gets hot it causes my scalp to itch and I scratch uncontrollably.,56676,3
56676,Gave it 3 stars because the lining is BLACK which heats the scalp really fast.,56676,3
56677,I was disappointed because it went below my knee.,56677,3
56677,I was expecting it to be longer.,56677,3
56678,Won't last after a few washed it will shred,56678,3
56679,"Slightly snug in the waist, if I eat or drink anything it might get uncomfortable.",56679,3
56680,The material was not that nice.,56680,3
56680,I ended up sending it back.,56680,3
56681,Not what I expected too sheer,56681,3
56682,I bought 4 of these dresses at the same time.,56682,3
56682,They only difference was their color; so I thought.,56682,3
56682,"Though tagged the same, this dress was about 2 inches wider than the others.",56682,3
56682,"Other than that, I really liked it so I gave it to my daughter rather than returning it.",56682,3
56683,Doesn't accomplish much except making me more aware of my weight loss goals because theres a tightness around my stomach.,56683,3
56683,"Compression shirts do the trick of dealing with my excess skin from 80 lbs of weight loss, this is nothing more than a more-likely-to-slip solution.",56683,3
56683,"That said, my rating is very personally driven.",56683,3
56683,I own a lot of compression shirts and don't wear a lot of tanks.,56683,3
56683,"If you do, have excess belly skin (this will not hide fat) and want compression - this product is perfect.",56683,3
56684,"First to give credit where it's due, this is the first time I ever ordered from Roamans, and all of us plus size girls know, you never know if the sizes run smaller or larger than the sizing charts say.",56684,3
56684,"This top runs quite large, and I'm sure my bad that it is so long!",56684,3
56684,It comes to just above my knees.,56684,3
56684,"But, the color is very pretty and the material is nice and soft.",56684,3
56684,This really would make a great maternity top.,56684,3
56684,I was blessed to inherit the right combination of hormones and other factors that happen at a certain age.,56684,3
56684,"So ladies, if you are blessed with a nice rounded belly, you will not like how this looks on you.",56684,3
56684,"I haven't washed it, but it looks like the type of fabric you will definitely should was cold and dry at a very low temp.",56684,3
56684,"If my shape were more proportional, I think I would buy several more of these in bright colors.",56684,3
56685,"The color doesn't match the picture, not a soft yellow, I think they sent me Gold instead.",56685,3
56685,"Not that happy, but not enough to send it back.",56685,3
56686,It fit very small small,56686,3
56687,Not as good of quality as I had hoped but ok for the price.,56687,3
56688,Very tight on my head.,56688,3
56690,"I like my shirt, too thin though I feel like if I bend down it will rip.",56690,3
56691,Not a lot of support for comfort.,56691,3
56692,I thought they were slightly smaller then the picture showed.,56692,3
56692,Though not bad looking.,56692,3
56692,I got this for a gift for me daughter in law.,56692,3
56693,When I wear it it always move around and doesn't stay in place,56693,3
56694,"The colors were as pictured, I ordered the XL which fit like a M. We decided to just keep the vest because it took over a month to receive it.",56694,3
56694,"I had to give my daughter a wrapped picture of the item for Christmas, which I was not happy with.",56694,3
56695,A little too bright beige.but still cute!,56695,3
56696,"Nice and soft but doesn't stay on head , I need to wear lighter hat under.",56696,3
56697,I would not wear it without a slip outside.,56697,3
56697,"Soft and thin, like an old tee shirt.",56697,3
56697,great if you like wearing pajamas all day.,56697,3
56697,"i do, so i like them, but it is not cute like on the model.",56697,3
56697,"It is a baggy, thin tee shirt, longer in the back and comfy.",56697,3
56697,"not for wearing outside, unless you like to show everyone what you have, or don't have...

if you look like the model, you could wear a burlap bag and it would look cute and stylish, so its always hard to tell...",56697,3
56697,"I personally wear this dress, top, whatever, when i am really tired and pair it with my husbands baggy old sweats that feel like the softest thing on earth.",56697,3
56698,They should have in between sizes.,56698,3
56699,"Nice, but run smallorder one size bigger",56699,3
56701,Too small but love the style.,56701,3
56702,kind of disappointed in these glasses.,56702,3
56702,as soon as I opened them they had a scratch on the lens.,56702,3
56702,the sides don't feel cheap but the lenses do.,56702,3
56702,wish they didn't have a scratch,56702,3
56703,Definitely not what was expected.,56703,3
56703,I sent it back for a refund.,56703,3
56704,"I was hoping this would look better on me than it does, but I feel like I'm wearing pajamas - it's far too large on me!",56704,3
56704,"I'm 5'4"" and weight 110 lbs.",56704,3
56704,It's so wide on me that I ordered an elastic waist belt to help cinch it in.,56704,3
56704,I wish I could have ordered an extra small size when I normally order small.,56704,3
56706,I brought two of these for myself and a co-worker.,56706,3
56706,They fit us both like were expected.,56706,3
56706,As other reviewers noted the veil is not as long as it is in the picture.,56706,3
56706,We thought they were cute.,56706,3
56707,"The blue gems are a bit darker than what I expected but that's ok.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of how long it took to get here and that Amazon still says it's on its way... but the rings were worth the wait absolutely stunning '

*update*
The rings start to change color and tarnish rather quickly..",56707,3
56707,Mine lost the black color after first month now are turning a copper color,56707,3
56708,do not order item from amazon App.,56708,3
56708,this item appears to be Grey from the pictures.,56708,3
56708,but wasn't till i was notified of the shipping the description said Green.,56708,3
56708,"Item is good quality, i can use it for the future, but just not for what i wanted.",56708,3
56709,I bought a size XS and it was too large to alter.,56709,3
56709,"My measurements are: bust - 32 inches, waist - 25 inches.",56709,3
56709,"So I will be selling it to a classmate, but i do like the design.",56709,3
56710,The dress came a week after valentines day and it was beautiful the only thing that became annoying to me was the fact that it was itchy to my skin after a night out for dinner i must say its a dress to wear for the moment but not an all nighter type of dress to wear for the simple fact of it being itchy and irritating to my skin it is also short i got it in a small but it was nice to take pictures in and ive got good compliments from others on how it looked.,56710,3
56711,This is a cute Halloween tee.,56711,3
56711,The fabric is a little thin but I can layer the shirt with another light weight tee.,56711,3
56712,Cute romper - cotton but seems a bit cheap.,56712,3
56713,"Could not make decision on these as they were half a size too big, however I could tell if they fit correctly it would be a good supportive shoe!",56713,3
56713,I am not completely satisfied with the ordering process as I had requested an exchange and did not get a response to that!,56713,3
56713,All I got was a refund on the price of the shoe!,56713,3
56714,I use these glasses for driving when the California sun is out.,56714,3
56714,"For a cheap pair of sunglasses,  the build on these is quite durable.",56714,3
56714,Yet It only took a few drops for both of the lens to pop out.,56714,3
56714,"They're easily popped right back in,  though it's something to consider.",56714,3
56714,Functionality wise the light tint does its job and they feel comfortable.,56714,3
56714,"For the price range,  these are nice.",56714,3
56715,"Pant legs are long,  Im 5ft 2in.",56715,3
56715,"Must be altered but looks good, Heavier fabric",56715,3
56716,"I really like this, however, it's a bit to long and makes sitting rather uncomfortable.",56716,3
56717,it fits good and it looks awesome when riding my harley!,56717,3
56718,"We like these, but the feet are already too small for my son who just turned 3.",56718,3
56718,We did order a 3T.,56718,3
56718,We need the feet because we are having a hard time keeping socks on him while he sleeps.,56718,3
56719,"But sadly won't be wearing it anytime soon, way to big",56719,3
56720,Very cute and comfy.,56720,3
56720,Overall fit is good.,56720,3
56720,Expected it to be longer.,56720,3
56720,"I'm 5'4"" and it doesn't even come close to being ankle length.",56720,3
56721,"Super cute shoe however runs wide and big, I'm a size 10 however this size 10 is too big.",56721,3
56721,"I went to a sporting goods store and tried the same shoe on  turns out with this particular shoe I'm a 9.5, so order half the size u normally are.",56721,3
56722,"The Product itself was great, shipping was horrible",56722,3
56724,"I got this dress but it was TOO Large, I love the style and material so I am saving it for when I get pregnant I could wear it :-)",56724,3
56725,I love it but its to big,56725,3
56726,It was too small I were an xl,56726,3
56727,I read all the reviews and ordered what size I thought would be best and its still way to large.,56727,3
56727,Love the shirt will order in a smaller size,56727,3
56728,The waist is too large.,56728,3
56729,Nice but slightly tight for the size.,56729,3
56730,The dress is pretty.,56730,3
56730,It came fast even when I had to get some things taken in.,56730,3
56730,The only thing I would say is that it's doesn't really do anything for your body.,56730,3
56730,It just makes u look like you have no waist or hips.,56730,3
56730,But everything else was good and the color is nice,56730,3
56731,After my third attempt I gave up with the sizing.,56731,3
56731,My son loved the design but couldn't find a good fit.,56731,3
56732,Size runs small in the arms,56732,3
56733,"However,  during my dance, beads came off.",56733,3
56733,"This was the first time I wore it, dance in it.",56733,3
56734,I washed this one time and the whole sleeve ripped completely off,56734,3
56735,OK...decent quality but runs big,56735,3
56736,She hasn't worn it,56736,3
56737,They are just a little bit to big I might go down a size next time,56737,3
56738,The sweater it self was so pretty but wayyy too small if you order this make sure you order two sizes up,56738,3
56740,Really cute but one of the earrings arrived slightly  bent.,56740,3
56741,good enough for the beach week,56741,3
56742,"Quality not the best, but for the money not bad.",56742,3
56742,Rather it was cotton.,56742,3
56743,"I ordered a small, and I was worried that it would be too small.",56743,3
56743,"It is really big, and it just barely shirrs around my hips.",56743,3
56743,It is cute with dark jeans or leggings.,56743,3
56743,The fabric is lightweight and a little flimsy; I will probably handwash it and dry it flat so that it does not stretch out more.,56743,3
56744,"My great grandson presently is fitting in size 5t, and the slacks are too big.",56744,3
56744,I will hold on to them until he can fit them.,56744,3
56745,This swim suit is made for those who have long torsos.,56745,3
56745,I will be sending it back because the material buckles on the sides because my torso is to sort for the suit.,56745,3
56745,"Other than that, it appears to be good quality.",56745,3
56746,"These underwear are nice, but the package I received does not have the same prints as what is pictured above.",56746,3
56747,It's cute but I bought a size larger than I usually wear and I can't even squeeze into it.,56747,3
56747,"42DD bra size, usually XL-2XL shirt size",56747,3
56748,The top was awesome but the bottoms were weird.,56748,3
56748,I had to return because the bottoms just we not fitting right.,56748,3
56750,"Nice because it keeps all the rain of during storms, and is very fashionable!",56750,3
56751,"Nice dress, but don't really like how the elastic waist fits, or feels for that matter.",56751,3
56752,"The style of these rings are adorable, however, they arrived mostly broken and seem to be made out of aluminum foil.",56752,3
56752,"Do not recommend, even for the price.",56752,3
56752,"That being said, customer service is impeccable!",56752,3
56752,They are sending replacements rings.,56752,3
56753,arm holes too tight.,56753,3
56753,The rest of the vest is alright.,56753,3
56753,Difficult to ascertain the degree of warmth from the information provided.,56753,3
56754,"I normally wear sizes S-M and I'm 5'4"" 112 lbs.",56754,3
56754,"By reading reviews to get a size bigger, I ordered L. I didn't have any problems with shipping because it arrived way earlier than expected.",56754,3
56754,"The quality, however, is not that great as expected of the price I paid.",56754,3
56754,It is poorly sewn and you can see lots of loose threads.,56754,3
56754,It is sheer but I'm fine with that.,56754,3
56754,"When I opened the package, it smelled kinda funky, though.",56754,3
56754,"Nevertheless, I would still wear it.",56754,3
56754,Just gotta be extra careful when handling this top.,56754,3
56755,very short..above belly button...gave it to a friends 17 year old...but very pretty..,56755,3
56756,Wish it would have fit.,56756,3
56757,"really pretty but the T-shirt is actually yellow, no green...",56757,3
56758,Really cute and flattering silhouette.,56758,3
56758,Runs small and material is thin and a bit cheap feeling.,56758,3
56759,"It's pretty thin material, so you can see everything!",56759,3
56761,It is not knee length but the bodice fits according to the measurements.,56761,3
56762,My son loves steampunk and really liked getting this as a gift.,56762,3
56762,"It was nice but from the photo it looked more brassy than it was, it was more all silver and seemed a little cheaper than it looked in the photo.",56762,3
56762,It was also a little small.,56762,3
56762,He still liked it but it was a little off from what I had expected.,56762,3
56763,Cute but just a tad heavy,56763,3
56764,Did not like the look on my feet.,56764,3
56765,Fit was somewhat awkward and the sweater doesnt fold as desired around the neck.,56765,3
56765,the sleeves are cuffed to mid forearm.,56765,3
56765,i bought a size medium.,56765,3
56765,"the fabric, though, is so soft and warm i can look passed the awkward fit.",56765,3
56767,they are okay.. no stretch.,56767,3
56767,after 1 year they were dumpster food.,56767,3
56768,"Am 5.4ft , 160 lbs and 34DD bra size, so I  ordered a large.",56768,3
56768,The skirt  was okay could have been a bit closer and the top fitted like a sports bra  but its wearable.,56768,3
56769,"Nice glove, nice color, soft, quality made, appreciate the discount.",56769,3
56769,However the gloves are not warm.,56769,3
56769,They are more of a spring fashion glove as opposed to a warm winter glove.,56769,3
56770,skirt too short returned it.,56770,3
56770,but refund was fast.,56770,3
56771,"Well made vest, but is very trim in its cut.",56771,3
56772,"The colors are great, but these are not made of cotton.",56772,3
56772,"Although that makes them lighter and thinner, they also don't absorb sweat the same way.",56772,3
56772,"I think these are more appropriate for something like a costume than, say, for hiking, which is why I bought them.",56772,3
56772,I can't pin down what they're made of.,56772,3
56773,The plastic case broke with in the second day.,56773,3
56773,Overall u get what u pay for.,56773,3
56774,Too much money for the material of this top.,56774,3
56776,You need to order a size larger than what you really are.,56776,3
56776,I'm a 33 in waist and need to order a large.,56776,3
56776,"The smaller they are, the smaller the junk covering flap is.",56776,3
56776,I guess it depends on you but I'M I'd order a size larger.,56776,3
56777,Cute and light weight but the second time I wore it kinda broke.,56777,3
56777,The stone popped out even thou I could fix it....other stones have also came out I'd say this is a perfect bracelet for a costume but not a life time piece.,56777,3
56778,"Cheap material, you get what you pay for.",56778,3
56779,I had to return these shoes due to fitting smaller than other shoes from the same maker.,56779,3
56779,Wasn't happy with the style.,56779,3
56780,It's OK alittle expensive for what I got.,56780,3
56781,"Loved this bag, but the zippers aren't very sturdy,",56781,3
56782,"Its slightly small, but fits well",56782,3
56783,Not really a slimmer or shaper but more of just body suit.,56783,3
56783,The hook & eye crotch closures are very picky and uncomfortable.,56783,3
56783,"For the price, it's a decent ""smoother"" but definitely not slimming!",56783,3
56783,Size runs a bit small; straps adjusted to max and still have to tug to fit.,56783,3
56783,Not even close to my Spanx...,56783,3
56784,"I normally wear a S in workout leggings, so that's what I ordered.",56784,3
56784,"The waistband way too big, however the butt and legs fit so I don't think I could go down a size without the butt being sheer when I'm just standing.",56784,3
56784,"Overall, it's just an awkward fit.",56784,3
56784,"The waistband also goes up very HIGH, past my natural waist, almost to the bottom of my bra (I'm 5'6"" so I'm not short by most standards).",56784,3
56784,"There's absolutely zero tummy control, so if you're looking for that, look elsewhere.",56784,3
56784,"These leggings are also pretty sheer when you bend over, so I definitely won't be using these on my leg days.",56784,3
56784,"I do, however, really love the color (I got brown) and they're cheap enough for me to want to keep them and wear them on upper body days at the gym.",56784,3
56784,I wouldn't buy them again because of the poor fit.,56784,3
56785,"I know I won't be pregnant much longer (two more weeks to go), but these pants make me want to order another pair.",56785,3
56785,I wear jeans a lot.,56785,3
56785,After washing these a few times (and not drying them in the dryer) they still shrunk.,56785,3
56785,"They were already borderline too short for my 5 almost 9 inch frame, but after washing they are certainly too short now.",56785,3
56785,I have a fashion forward friend who makes fun of me.,56785,3
56785,"I let her, because when I wear these now, they truly look too short.",56785,3
56785,"Other than that, they are not bad pants.",56785,3
56785,"Nothing is tearing, other than being too short for me, they are excellent.",56785,3
56785,I just wish they were longer for taller Momma's..,56785,3
56787,I wish I'd ordered medium but it's ok .,56787,3
56787,The back is cute.,56787,3
56788,"Was a little too large for everyday wear, but looks great",56788,3
56789,"Nice for costume, too small for adult.",56789,3
56789,good color beard is nice plus to whole look,56789,3
56790,Like these - fit as expected,56790,3
56791,I'm usually a small but reading the reviews I knew I had to get a medium.,56791,3
56791,They sent me a large and the top fit perfect but the buttons were too small.,56791,3
56792,Way to small but really cute,56792,3
56793,Its thinner than I anticipated however still covers the pant opening if wearing loose tops.,56793,3
56793,Not sure if it will cover that well if you are into wearing tighter tops/shirts.,56793,3
56793,"Not too tight, so is a comfortable wear.",56793,3
56794,"The v necks are five star, but the turtleneck is itchy and the tunic is much shorter than the v neck tunics.",56794,3
56794,I can't recommend that turtlenecks.,56794,3
56795,"Sadly, this dress was way too small for me.",56795,3
56795,I gave it to a friend who wears a Medium.,56795,3
56795,It fits her perfectly.,56795,3
56796,They were a bit too large and I didn't like how stiff the soles were.,56796,3
56796,"But for some people, that might be what you want - just not for me, so I returned them.",56796,3
56797,It was so cute!,56797,3
56797,Too bad I couldn't wear it.,56797,3
56797,3 stars becuz I had to give the skirt away to my taller and skinnier sister as an early birthday gift.,56797,3
56797,I am 5'5  and 180 lbs but not round really... Moore like solid.,56797,3
56797,The skirt wouldn't even connect at the waist.,56797,3
56797,Sorry for the seemingly bad review.,56797,3
56798,Weird material but I like it,56798,3
56799,I think is not strong but confortable.,56799,3
56800,This sweater is cute but runs a little small.,56800,3
56800,Also it is really itchy so be sure to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath it.,56800,3
56801,"I usually order a Lg or Xlg but read the reviews and just to be very safe, I ordered a 2XL.",56801,3
56801,I would probably be the size of a reg Medium/Lg.,56801,3
56801,Its cute but too small.,56801,3
56803,It's super cute but way too small.,56803,3
56803,I had to give it away wich was a bumber.,56803,3
56804,yeah its probably time you guys realize that the top and bottom of wome aren't the same size anymore.,56804,3
56804,"while the top fits perfectly, the bottoms are tooo big.",56804,3
56804,i probably needed to order another set in a smaller size in order to get the desired fit.,56804,3
56805,The Shirt is from a descent material and the neck and sleeves are good size.,56805,3
56805,"However, the shirt is definitely not a slim fit, which makes the shirt bulky.",56805,3
56806,Got the shirt in white thinking it may be office appropriate.,56806,3
56806,"As other reviewers said, shirt is very short and boxy.",56806,3
56806,It's hard to tell from the photos but the back is incredibly sheer.,56806,3
56806,"Sadly while the front is cute and work appropriate, the back is completely see-through.",56806,3
56806,Will be returning the shirt and continuing my hunt for a work-appropriate white top.,56806,3
56807,Came exactly as pictured thankfully considering reading other reviews where people received incorrectly colored straps.,56807,3
56807,Mine had a honey brown/natural leather appearance as advertised.,56807,3
56807,It is also reasonably comfortable for the price and with a good fit and finish.,56807,3
56809,"I'm hoping I can have one sent to me that looks like the pic advertised...this one cut off the colorful part of the flower, which was what I liked about the shirt in the first place.",56809,3
56809,It is nice material and I like the fit.,56809,3
56810,They fit tight they were somewhat small for me.,56810,3
56810,However they did the job for our little party thanks.,56810,3
56811,"I bought the extra small, I'm 5'5 and it came down way bellow my knees.",56811,3
56811,almost half way down my calf.,56811,3
56814,The quality was poor.,56814,3
56814,The beads were falling off the top but it was pretty.,56814,3
56814,It would be a nice dress for the price.,56814,3
56815,IT WAS OK AS FAR AS MATERIAL BUT KINDA SHORT IN ME AND IM ONLY 5'3 BUT I ALSO HAVE BIG HIPS...,56815,3
56816,It's ok would have been nice if it came with the same  amount of needles as piercings,56816,3
56817,"It's too small, wish it was little bit bigger",56817,3
56818,"Way too small, bought this for my daughter who wears a Youth Large.",56818,3
56818,I thought by ordering a AS she would have the room to wear a long sleeve shirt and leggings to keep her warm Halloween night.,56818,3
56818,Not the case at all.,56818,3
56818,It's now too late to return it and have a new one here by Halloween.,56818,3
56819,Good for third trimester.,56819,3
56819,Too much material before that,56819,3
56820,Came with a busted zipper.,56820,3
56821,These socks will look great if you don't look too closely.,56821,3
56821,They are much thinner than I expected them to be and the batman logo is sewn in with a glittery plastic-ish material.,56821,3
56822,XL fits like a Medium.,56822,3
56823,After reading reviews that said to go a size up i did just that and was very disappointed... they were too big!,56823,3
56823,I love the colours and the material.,56823,3
56823,The fact that they are not see-through is great.,56823,3
56823,i don't usually wear these type of legging.,56823,3
56823,I reorder them and got some more with my correct size if u are a medium buy medium,56823,3
56825,these are good except if they are going to fit on the thigh the tops need to be bigger.,56825,3
56825,Im 27 and 93 lbs so I have pretty small legs and they are too tight on my legs let alone if i was someone larger.,56825,3
56825,Everything but that is great I just really can't wear them because they pinch off circulation on my thigh's,56825,3
56826,"This was a cute little set, but way too big for my tiny little newborn.",56826,3
56826,"It was soft, although I thought it might be fuzzier.",56826,3
56826,The anchor was a tiny bit crooked on the hat.,56826,3
56826,I ended up returning as I couldn't use it for my little guy.,56826,3
56827,"Although the colors are pretty, the shirt is very thin and light weight.",56827,3
56827,I will be washing it by hand and hang to dry.,56827,3
56827,I would not have paid this price if I had seen it physically first.,56827,3
56828,Fits too large in the lower tummy area and too long between under the breast to the lower waist.,56828,3
56829,I read the reviews and I chose to buy the dress anyway.,56829,3
56829,So it's my bad.,56829,3
56829,"BUUUUT, I ordered a Large because it's my normal size (ish).",56829,3
56829,The bust is extremely low cut if you're large chested as I am.,56829,3
56829,"I'm a 36G, but I wear a size 8/10 in regular clothes so I'm not huge or anything.",56829,3
56829,"The bust, waist and length are awesome, stretchy soft material I'm really happy with that portion.",56829,3
56829,"I don't think I have especially fat arms or anything, but these arms were SOOOOOO TIGHT i am sure I would have started turning blue if I kept them on.",56829,3
56829,"So, I just cut the part that makes it too tight on the bottom (as I've done for friends in the past to alter their clothes) and it made a big difference.",56829,3
56829,"I definitely kept it because I like the color, the style and the price was good!",56829,3
56829,"But unless you have TINY arms, you will likely need to alter the arm holes.",56829,3
56830,"Black pair fits perfect, but the gray ones seem to be about 2 sizes too small.",56830,3
56832,For an XL its more like a medium.,56832,3
56832,I wish the piece of cloth for the bossom was broader and its too thin,56832,3
56833,We ordered size 5 years for our 4 year old who is average 4 year old size.,56833,3
56833,If your child is tall you'll want to order a size or 2 up.,56833,3
56833,Our son says he loves it.,56833,3
56833,Keeps him warm at breakfast.,56833,3
56833,The belt could use a little more length to make it easier for little hands to tie.,56833,3
56834,Overall I'm very happy with the bracelet that I received.,56834,3
56834,"It's easy to put on, it doesn't fall off and it didn't get damaged when I was stuck outside in a storm.",56834,3
56834,"The necklace that I received however I'm not happy with, it was way too small for my neck and it felt like it was choking me, so I would say it's more designed a child....and I personally think that I have an average sized neck.",56834,3
56834,I did receive this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.,56834,3
56835,"My daughter is 120 lbs 5'2"" bra 34b.",56835,3
56835,"We bought a size 2 and the bust area is about 4 or 5"" too small.",56835,3
56835,The rest of the dress fits perfectly.,56835,3
56835,If she gets a bigger size to fit her chest the bottom will be too big,56835,3
56836,Did not help keep my pants up--just added a small extra layer to the bottom of my shirt.,56836,3
56837,I had really high hopes for these.,56837,3
56837,I wear lots of knee and thigh high socks and I am considered plus.,56837,3
56837,I'm (In America) a 15-16 or XL in bottoms.,56837,3
56837,"I'm also 175lbs and 5'7"".",56837,3
56837,"When ever I get thigh high socks, they never reach my thighs.",56837,3
56837,So I end up just wearing them as knee socks.,56837,3
56837,"So when I saw this, I was like, plus size thigh highs!?",56837,3
56837,So I got them.,56837,3
56837,"When I got them, they're the texture of tights.",56837,3
56837,So I though that was a good sign.,56837,3
56837,Maybe they'll fit to me and won't roll down or anything!?,56837,3
56837,I put them on and.. they gave my thighs a little muffin top.,56837,3
56837,"Now, it wasn't a bad muffin top.",56837,3
56837,It was a small one.,56837,3
56837,"But it made it look obvious I was a big girl trying to wear skinny girls clothes.... Then, I took one step forward, and they rolled down.",56837,3
56837,"Maybe if I got some garters, they'd look alright on me.",56837,3
56837,I'm very self conscious.,56837,3
56837,"Also, on one of the foot of the sock, around the toes, it started a tear.",56837,3
56837,Its like a teach in your tights that hasn't made a hole yet it might if you're not careful.,56837,3
56837,The is Not very bad.,56837,3
56837,Who's gonna notice anyway?,56837,3
56837,I'll be in shoes.,56837,3
56837,But it just kinda annoying.,56837,3
56837,"So, I'm currently wearing them as just knee socks.. on good days they won't roll down my thighs.",56837,3
56837,I think they're very cute though.,56837,3
56837,Just good for knee socks.,56837,3
56837,I'm still on the search for GOOD plus size thigh highs.,56837,3
56838,Well before you go and buy this you should contact the seller and ask them what size you should get!,56838,3
56838,Tell them your size!,56838,3
56838,I did that and when I got it it was the perfect size!,56838,3
56838,The two stars that were not added was because of the material of fabric was used!,56838,3
56838,It's a very light weight and soft material!,56838,3
56838,The picture that I was looked like it was made of heavy cloth!,56838,3
56838,It's not at all.,56838,3
56838,Like they say you get what you pay for!,56838,3
56839,not exact like photo,56839,3
56841,Nice but the brim is a bit too big and floppy.,56841,3
56842,"Difficult to open and close, which makes them hard to put in your ears.",56842,3
56843,"Fits well and works much better than any normal ""cotton sock"", however the first time I used them (on an 8 mile run), I finished with a new blister on the back of my heal.",56843,3
56843,I was hoping the wrightsock would be a cooler option to the Belega Blister Resist socks.,56843,3
56843,"While they may be slightly cooler, I have yet to get any blisters in the Belega's and I found them to be more comfortable in general.",56843,3
56844,I got the hammer but I got it as a key chain when it was posted as a necklace,56844,3
56845,It appears somewhat nicer in the pictures than it actually is in person.,56845,3
56845,The colors also look better in the pics which may be due to the lighting .,56845,3
56845,I think it will likely be OK with leggings but that's it.,56845,3
56845,"I'd never choose  to wear with jeans or slacks as i fear it will look ""sloppy"" which I can't blame on the somewhat large sizing but the  cut itself imo.",56845,3
56846,My baby is drowning in this!,56846,3
56846,"It is cute though, I think maybe it will fit him next year (he is 18 months) Now my baby is 22lbs so if you have a larger toddler it may work for you",56846,3
56847,"Fit ok, but it was supposed to be purple and it's VERY burgandy.",56847,3
56847,"Kind of a bummer, whole point was to buy my girlfriend's favorite color for her.",56847,3
56848,I ordered a M and received a S. I like the one piece suite!,56848,3
56848,I am 5'3 and about 130lbs.,56848,3
56848,If I would have received the correct size I would love it!,56848,3
56849,Bought these gloves as part of a Halloween costume.,56849,3
56849,"Worked well for my purposes, but if you're buying to use regularly, be advised that the green pair I ordered did leak a bit of dye onto my hands after I sweated a bit.",56849,3
56850,"nice ,but too big for me,for my mother is better.",56850,3
56851,Ok so I'm a top heavy woman.,56851,3
56851,The top was way to small and barely covered my boobs.,56851,3
56851,I will be giving it to my step daughter.,56851,3
56851,The shorts are adorable and I love them.,56851,3
56851,I will be keeping them and wearing them with a cute flowy blue tank top I ordered as well.,56851,3
56851,So this was a 50/50 buy.,56851,3
56852,"I love the look of this, but it is not as loose as it looks on the model.",56852,3
56852,I wanted to order a few of these too.,56852,3
56853,"Cute shoes, very light and easy to clean.",56853,3
56853,"My only issue is they are not very sturdy shoes and broken down faster then I would have assumed, about 3 months in and already needed new shoes.",56853,3
56854,it fell apart so fast,56854,3
56855,"One broke right away, but the other is still in good shape.",56855,3
56856,More of a tunic than a dress...I am 5'3 and it goes just past my bottom....I will wear with dark leggings.,56856,3
56857,"It was nice, but didn't last too long.",56857,3
56859,I liked this mask but I hadn't even wore it for two hours and one of the straps broke off so I couldn't wear it anymore.,56859,3
56860,Sent back size was too large,56860,3
56861,"Cute, but it's baggy, not meant for anyone with curvys either.",56861,3
56861,Its a low cut box of a shirt.,56861,3
56863,Like the longer inseam that doesn't pull up on your thigh when you sit down.,56863,3
56863,The waist I ordered is a little large but some of the reviews suggested that the shorts shrunk a bit so after washing should be fine.,56863,3
56864,"Love the feel only thing I don't like is that the dress is very long definitely gonna have to get it altered hang dry when wash i got a small and fits like a glove I bought 3,colors red blue and tan",56864,3
56865,The hat fits great but the quality is very poor.,56865,3
56865,The puff ball on top is coming off and the puppy dog is coming unsewed from the boggin.,56865,3
56866,Love the hat but received the blue instead of black.,56866,3
56868,"i thought the tail was attached like a real mermaid
tail it shows that it is closed so i just dealed with it",56868,3
56869,"This dress was very pretty and made from a nice, soft, flowy, material.",56869,3
56869,It was definitely sized small so order a size or two up.,56869,3
56869,My biggest disappoint was after washing.,56869,3
56869,"I washed this on delicate handwash cycle, it came out of the wash full of holes.",56869,3
56869,"I was really, really, sad.",56869,3
56869,"On a positive note, I was able to return the item for a refund.",56869,3
56870,"I like it, but the fit is a challenge- wide and short.",56870,3
56871,nice looking just wrong size,56871,3
56872,Good quality but not true to size.,56872,3
56872,Big especially on the upper sides.,56872,3
56873,"I think these socks are great, but I received two pairs of the little cherub ones (not my favorite) and did not receive a pair with Starry Night.",56873,3
56873,"Additionally, I received a completely different orange pair that does not have Edvard Munch's The Scream (my favorite).",56873,3
56873,"Good socks, good price, but the packs may come messed up.",56873,3
56874,It looks like the picture.,56874,3
56874,"I'm
Not crazy about the fabric.",56874,3
56874,It's very fitted and feels like Lycra.,56874,3
56876,"Material was very think, and it was sized smaller than other brands of the same size.",56876,3
56878,Neck was small compaired to shirt size.,56878,3
56878,This was supposed to be an 18 - 181/2 but the neck was not like I wear.,56878,3
56878,But it does fit and doesn't choke me but just a bit uncomfortable.,56878,3
56880,The top fit better than expected but the bottom only had one small problem.,56880,3
56880,"The split was too rounded and wide, unlike the advertised photo.",56880,3
56880,"I'll have to fix it wit needle and thread to look more like advertised, but overall, it's ok. Meh",56880,3
56881,The neck is way to big.,56881,3
56882,not very good quality and good looking.,56882,3
56882,Golden chain is too thick and heavy.,56882,3
56882,Picture on the front is blur.,56882,3
56883,"Fits a little snug, I recommend going at least one size up if not 2.",56883,3
56883,But it's cute and cozy.,56883,3
56884,"The shirt wasn't really off shoulder as shown in the picture, and the arms was too tight.",56884,3
56885,There is no flexibility in the fabric,56885,3
56886,"looks nice but i guess won't last long , as the material is v Cheap!",56886,3
56887,"The quality was fine, but definitely won't fit anyone that's any bigger than a size 6.",56887,3
56887,They have some stretch but theyr definitely not a one size fits all.,56887,3
56887,I am a size 10 and they were too small.,56887,3
56887,Luckily they fit my sister.,56887,3
56887,Should have known one size can't fit all,56887,3
56888,"I am 5'4 115lbs and 34A bra size, a size small in almost everything and size 4/5 in jeans.",56888,3
56888,I have ordered bathing suits from China before and they fit perfectly.,56888,3
56888,The top on this bathing suit fit perfectly!,56888,3
56888,However the bottoms are way too small.,56888,3
56888,"I can pair the top with just a plain black bottom, I'm just disappointed it didn't fit.",56888,3
56890,"The lace applique on this is beautiful, but the netted material it's sewn to is very scratchy, and I don't think it will last more than a few wears.",56890,3
56890,"It was purchased to be worn to a wedding, so we are keeping it, but we don't recommend if you're looking for something to last.",56890,3
56891,I love the leather  cap .The reason why give it a three-star  because it has too many folding creases on the Cap .,56891,3
56891,And I've been working on trying to get those creases out My leather cap.,56891,3
56891,And when I put it on my head  it looks  very funny  looking.but other than that I'm happy,56891,3
56892,This is very nice BUT it will NOT fit Pandora or Kay safety clasps.,56892,3
56892,It also looses it shine really quickly.,56892,3
56892,"I have lots of stainless jewelry and this is just not as shiny,,,,actually its kind of DULL.",56892,3
56892,It does fit the regular charms from Kay and Pandora and the little chain with heart is a nice touch.,56892,3
56893,Cut a little on the small size,56893,3
56894,I used it as a cover up and it fits great and looks great; however it was cheaply made and started coming apart after only a couple uses.,56894,3
56895,The boobs are fitted weirdly instead of cups try something like foam for the top to make it fit better.,56895,3
56895,I am a size 18 and ordered the biggest size thought I would fit just right but the waist is smaller.,56895,3
56896,The dress is nice.,56896,3
56896,"The ad did not have the size listed and my wife took a chance that it was a one size fits all, but it was a small when we received it, not big deal tho, it fits her daughter.",56896,3
56897,"Not as soft as I'd like, The Arms Are A Bit To Short FOR ME To Use Comfortably with the thumb holes.",56897,3
56897,Rather bulky but for the price a fair deal.,56897,3
56898,Fit a little small,56898,3
56899,"It fits as expected but I was thinking it was going to be a normal ""cotton"" material tank top instead it was polyester and spandex, that's the only thing I don't like",56899,3
56901,Product runs real small,56901,3
56902,This suit is really cute and comes with a removable halter strap and non-removable push-up padding.,56902,3
56902,"It could have been a five, but I rated it lower for the inaccurate description of the cup size.",56902,3
56902,I'm a 36D and I got a large.,56902,3
56902,"It is best not to get the suit if you are anything more than a B cup, because size increases seem to be with the band and not the cup.",56902,3
56902,"The bottoms fit me as they should, though they run closer to medium.",56902,3
56903,I do like it but the zipper broke the 2 day and I was disappointed.,56903,3
56904,Decent dress for the price,56904,3
56905,"Litttle on the short side, but it would be a cute shirt.",56905,3
56906,The dress is beautiful however the bust area runs large compared to the waistline and the bust finish was not properly stitched.,56906,3
56907,I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and the sleeves were way too tight.,56907,3
56907,I gave it to a friend and she loves it.,56907,3
56908,Too long for me personally but I'm very small but sooooooooo pretty.,56908,3
56909,I wouldn't call this long at all.,56909,3
56909,"It doesn't even have a clasp and I am barely able to pull it over my head, since it's NOT long.",56909,3
56909,I gave it 3 stars because it is very pretty.,56909,3
56909,I will purchase an extension with a clasp and definitely wear it then.,56909,3
56910,A bit heavy on the ear.,56910,3
56910,"I am just not accustomed to it, but these are beautiful..",56910,3
56911,The skirt was very see-through.,56911,3
56912,I love it but it fits too small.,56912,3
56912,I had to buy 2 sizes up.,56912,3
56913,"Not the best made item I have ever ordered, but my husband likes it, for his coins and a couple bills in the little pocket.",56913,3
56914,Very disappointed in the color.,56914,3
56914,It is more of a cream color than off white.,56914,3
56914,We are using the onesie for family portraits and I am glad I did not buy white shirts for my husband and I because it would have looked awful.,56914,3
56914,I feel the product photo and description is misleading so I had to make sure I gave a review so no one else was disappointed.,56914,3
56916,"It was shorter and a little small and the sides were longer than expected, but I'm still going to wear it",56916,3
56917,Not great quality fabric but satisfactory for the price.,56917,3
56917,Shrinks up a bit in length.,56917,3
56918,"Somewhat cheap looking, but decent for the price.",56918,3
56919,The shine went away within a month,56919,3
56920,"This is a very cute swimsuit, but the large fits more like a small & the bottoms are very high cut in the back & ""cheeky""",56920,3
56921,"The necklace is gorgeous, however, not pleased with the way the earrings set on my ear.",56921,3
56921,The latter should not in anyway discourage the purchase...it is a beautiful set.,56921,3
56921,I just prefer a flat fit against my ear.,56921,3
56922,"Skirt was a perfect fit, but shirt was super small... odd combo in sizes.",56922,3
56923,Fits good but quality is what you pay I guess.,56923,3
56923,I am not crazy about it.,56923,3
56923,If you are looking for a costume that makes you stand up this is not  your best choice.,56923,3
56924,It broke the 1st time I use it but it's easy to fix,56924,3
56925,A little tie but fits fine,56925,3
56926,"I ordered these shoes in a size 7M thinking they would fit like my last pair (same shoe, different colour) and they were tight.",56926,3
56926,Luckily after wearing them for a bit I was able to stretch them a bit and are now wearable.,56926,3
56926,"They are very adorable shoes, but I would order 1/2 size up, or just stick with your regular size, but will probably need to stretch them out like I had to.",56926,3
56927,A bit thin but its ok,56927,3
56929,I will have alterations done.,56929,3
56929,I think it should be better sized.,56929,3
56931,the fit was off.,56931,3
56932,These were a good quality but ran small.,56932,3
56932,I ended up donating them.,56932,3
56933,"This is the second shirt, first one was black and the fit was perfect.",56933,3
56933,"The white for some reason is much bigger and longer, though it is the same size.",56933,3
56934,The fit was fine but the quality left something to be desired.,56934,3
56934,"It isn't silk, it's a bit stiff and the pretty lace edging doesn't extend around the entire hem making it drape awkwardly, unevenly.",56934,3
56935,came in mail broken but I was able to repair with some hot glue.,56935,3
56935,Necklace is pretty to wear and pairs best with dark colored outfits.,56935,3
56936,I received it earlier than the said date.,56936,3
56936,"The earrings are a tad big, and it looks cheap from a side view.",56936,3
56936,The chain is a great length and is nicely made.,56936,3
56937,Sponge brush broke with first use.,56937,3
56938,Love my other Rykas!!!,56938,3
56938,I have 3 pairs of Torrey style - most comfortable shoe ever!,56938,3
56938,These are same size but almost fall off my feet when walking.,56938,3
56938,They also rub on  top of foot where elastic is' attached  so blisters will happen when not wearing socks.,56938,3
56938,They have a weird fit -  maybe why price was so cheap.,56938,3
56938,I wanted them for summer to wear without socks - so cheap or not - back they go...  maybe order down 1/2 size I guess and plan on wearing socks.,56938,3
56939,"Nicely made, unfortunately to small.",56939,3
56939,I was afraid to try to widen the opening.,56939,3
56940,I  give a 3 star because I had it rushed for a fishing tournament and when I got it the pants were not in it :(,56940,3
56941,"5 stars for quality, but the fit is way off.",56941,3
56941,"I normally wear a US size 4 or small, but based on other comments, I ordered this skirt in XL.",56941,3
56941,"It fits, but just barely.",56941,3
56941,"The quality is great - nice thick wool, the skirt is lined, and the style is very flattering, so if you can order it a couple of sizes up, I would recommend this skirt.",56941,3
56941,5 stars for quality.,56941,3
56941,1 star for the really bad sizing.,56941,3
56942,Kind of not as long as it looks in the photo and smaller than expected.,56942,3
56943,I got this for some maternity photos I was having done.,56943,3
56943,I was fairly large chested towards the end of my pregnancy and this just didn't fit right.,56943,3
56943,"Overall, I didn't find it a flattering dress.",56943,3
56944,looks great help up for months but began to fade.,56944,3
56944,do not wear in the shower,56944,3
56945,it was kind of too large but  I am using it.,56945,3
56946,Shirt is very thin and runs on the large side.,56946,3
56947,not exactly what I expected doesn't block glare in day time no better than regular sunglasses,56947,3
56948,Smaller than I had expected.,56948,3
56949,"Wallet is not long enough to store USD, but can easily hold dollars if they are folded.",56949,3
56949,The pouches that keep the cards have stretched greatly over the 2 months I have had this wallet.,56949,3
56949,They have become loose to the point that pulling out the wallet from my pocket risks all of my cards falling onto the ground.,56949,3
56949,"The leather is high quality, but I don't believe the wallet to be a well-designed.",56949,3
56950,Too big for my head.,56950,3
56950,Falls right off my nose,56950,3
56951,I should have listened to the other reviews and not ordered this.,56951,3
56951,"Although it looks just like the photo, the fit is that of a garbage bag.",56951,3
56951,I ordered a small and I am 130 lbs and it swallowed me whole!,56951,3
56951,I suppose this would look good on other people but not on me.,56951,3
56952,cheap looking but you get what you pay for.,56952,3
56952,It does the job.,56952,3
56953,I thought the bow color navy but it is black not matching together,56953,3
56954,I really like Totoro!,56954,3
56954,I think this is a very cute bag.,56954,3
56954,"However, I was expecting something slightly different.",56954,3
56954,The inside of this bag is a bit small.,56954,3
56954,I got this bag to take with me to my Weight Watchers meetings.,56954,3
56954,And to use as a new purse for the few items I carry with me on a daily basis.,56954,3
56954,"Items like: My wallet, my cellphone, my prescription sunglasses with case, my lighter, my smokes, a pack of gum, a daily dose of medications that I am required to take, travel tissue, travel toothbrush, travel toothpaste, travel mouthwash, travel wipes, you know the essentials of hygiene when on the go.",56954,3
56954,This is supposed to be a school backpack for a child.,56954,3
56954,Which I am ok with.,56954,3
56954,"I didn't want to purchase a huge Jansport or some other brand of backpack designed for school when all I needed was something I could carry my Weight Watchers books and info in, one day out of the week and the few other items listed.",56954,3
56954,I have three binders.,56954,3
56954,"They fit into this bag, very snuggly.",56954,3
56954,"One of them actually can't fit all the way to the bottom, it's a very tight fit.",56954,3
56954,This makes trying to use the front pocket pretty much impossible.,56954,3
56954,The two side pockets are still usable.,56954,3
56954,It does not fit all of my things unless I take out the Weight Watchers.,56954,3
56954,Doing that prevents me from using it as a purse.,56954,3
56954,I wouldn't recommend this for a child who has a lot of school supplies to carry around with them each day.,56954,3
56954,I also would not recommend this as a mini backpack purse for women who have a lot of items to carry.,56954,3
56954,"I was hoping it would have been large enough to do double duty at the same time, not do one thing at a time.",56954,3
56955,the cross slips through the infinity very easily.,56955,3
56955,use caution while wearing.,56955,3
56956,Littl taller than I expected and I thought porkpies were round not oval.,56956,3
56957,"The material is great, but the sizing is way off.",56957,3
56957,"I wear a 34D and weigh 127, I ordered the medium based on my measurements.",56957,3
56957,I think even the small would be too big for me.,56957,3
56957,Not worth it to bring to a seamstress to take in.,56957,3
56957,"Love the top, just wish it fit better.",56957,3
56958,I love the colors and the style but the material is very stiff like burlap.,56958,3
56958,"There is no give in the fabric, so if it doesn't fit loosely, it's not comfortable.",56958,3
56958,"If the fabric was a different material, I would love it!",56958,3
56959,"Its smaller than I expected
The material quality is average
But my kid liked it",56959,3
56960,Too large and it doesn't look like in the picture.,56960,3
56961,"Pretty, but VERY small.",56961,3
56962,Cute but sizes run WAY large AND its is kind of itchy,56962,3
56963,"Beautiful dress - runs way too small - will be returning - usually where a size 12 dress so, bought a large and little too tight for this somewhat married curvy body!",56963,3
56963,would have to go to a 1X before my husband would say Oh!,56963,3
56964,"So I got this shirt yesterday, and I'm not mad.",56964,3
56964,"It's asian-sizing, so I ordered two sizes up and it drapes over large as expected.",56964,3
56964,"But the neck is higher up - which is fine, I could dress it up or down this way and it looks alright.",56964,3
56964,"The material, however, is surprisingly thicker than I thought it would be (that could change after a wash or two) but I was just surprised as to how it looked.",56964,3
56964,"That being said, since it isn't mesh you can wear something under it or not - dealers choice.",56964,3
56964,I have a large chest and this still fits fine.,56964,3
56965,The compass does not work at all.,56965,3
56965,Other than that its an ok watch.,56965,3
56966,These guys are awesome to order from!,56966,3
56966,"The only issue I have is I can tell the studs aren't sterling silver, I can tell because of the way it interacts with my piercing.",56966,3
56966,That aside I'm very pleased,56966,3
56967,Really  thin material,56967,3
56969,Like this product fine.,56969,3
56969,I would add a couple of inches length to the hem.,56969,3
56969,But I like the fact it's different from what I see everyday.,56969,3
56970,I have no complaints with the shirt itself however the imprint wasn't as advertised.,56970,3
56970,The image depicted is Captain America's shield.,56970,3
56970,What I received was a target (perhaps the Target logo??).,56970,3
56970,Not a huge deal as I only wear the shirt to the gym but I wanted Captain America to fit in with my other superhero shirts.,56970,3
56971,"First, the material does not appear to be canvas as I know it.",56971,3
56971,It is more shiny.,56971,3
56971,"Second, I had to take scissors to many loose threads on the inside.",56971,3
56971,"Third, the stitches look like a basting stitch, not a permanent stitch...I hope it holds.",56971,3
56971,"if not, I'll be returning it.",56971,3
56971,"Fourth, the color does not look like the picture, and the strap color does not match the rest of the purse.",56971,3
56971,"Fifth, the closed pocket on the end is not big enough for my HTC cell phone, and the open pocket on the other end is not big enough for a water bottle.",56971,3
56971,"It holds my big daily planner, but am not sure if I like it or not yet.",56971,3
56971,Update:  Less than a week using it and there is a mark on the front pocket that won't come off.,56971,3
56971,It looks like a scratch more than a pen mark or something like that.,56971,3
56971,I'm starting to like it because I wanted cross body bag for when I walk to work.,56971,3
56971,It saves on my back and neck and gives me hands free.,56971,3
56971,"Further update:  I've only had this purse for about 6 weeks, and the sewing on the strap came apart at church this morning.",56971,3
56971,I wouldn't buy it again.,56971,3
56971,It's a little too fat for me.,56971,3
56972,I was really excited when this came in the mail but when I opened the package I was very disappointed.,56972,3
56972,First the sweater is not oversized like the picture.,56972,3
56972,When you lay it down it looks like you're average sweater.,56972,3
56972,And that was somewhat ok with me.,56972,3
56972,But when I tried it on I discovered the the neck hole could fit 3 people in in resulting in it fitting in a awkward off shoulder look.,56972,3
56972,And the sleeves were somewhat tight.,56972,3
56972,Also the sweater is see through.,56972,3
56972,Also it has a very odd odor to it I would recommend to wash before wearing it.,56972,3
56973,Way too small super pretty though.,56973,3
56974,This tunic is very cute and of nice quality but it runs quite long for us shorter girls.,56974,3
56974,"It could easily pass as a mini dress on my 5'4"" frame.",56974,3
56974,As I was hoping to wear it with leggings it defeated the purpose of my purchase.,56974,3
56974,I also think this tunic would be prone to easy wrinkling.,56974,3
56974,"As such, I returned it.",56974,3
56974,It may work for you and the price is good for what it is;  just wasn't what I was looking for.,56974,3
56974,"For reference, I'm 54 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28 waist 34 and ordered this in 076 Burgundy / Medium.",56974,3
56974,I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.,56974,3
56974,"I paid full price for this item and wasn't compensated in any way but would appreciate a ""yes"" click if you found my review helpful :)",56974,3
56975,Finding good pants is a trial and error for me.,56975,3
56975,"I've got a slim athletic build and I was hoping for a lose fit, but these things feel like a pair of skinny jeans.",56975,3
56975,This really makes the pockets uncomfortable if I have anything larger than coins or credit cards in them.,56975,3
56976,"It's a bit small for size 5 (almost equal to size 4T from other brands), plus the shape of the brief is too triangle, a bit like a bikini style, not too suitable for kids.",56976,3
56977,It's pretty tight but light and breathable.,56977,3
56978,I like this item but feel the backings weren't big enough for the weight of the skull.,56978,3
56979,"Fits nice, but is like towel quality",56979,3
56981,The quality is not good,56981,3
56982,It was too small unfortunately.,56982,3
56983,"Too small for my husband, who has a 36 in waist.",56983,3
56984,These earrings are beautiful but they are quite a bit larger than I expected.,56984,3
56984,I bought them for my daughter.,56984,3
56984,I will give them to her next week; hopefully she will like them.,56984,3
56985,"To large for a man to be a wallet, almost as big as a small hand purse.",56985,3
56985,"Very nice looking tho, my son couldn't use it too girly for him.",56985,3
56985,So it's in my purse!!!,56985,3
56987,I ordered a large and it is tiny!,56987,3
56987,Very form fitting and short sleeves.,56987,3
56987,Like a child's 10/12.,56987,3
56987,I wear a size 2 in dresses in the small asian-hole-in-the-wall stores in strip malls and its still fit like an xsmall.,56987,3
56987,If it wasn't $10 I'd return it.,56987,3
56987,But I'm just gonna wear it differently.,56987,3
56987,But the pic here must be on a 10 year little girl.,56987,3
56987,"other then that, the maroon is as shown and its cute just not like the pic's fit at all, unless your a child's 10/12",56987,3
56990,"The costume is true to size, the only problem I had with the costume is the length and the fit of the legs with the ""armor"" because I am 6' tall.",56990,3
56990,I had to make alterations but it is overall still a good costume.,56990,3
56990,Other tall women should just purchase knowing that alterations will need to be made.,56990,3
56991,"Fun for a little bit, however, the color is leaving super fast.",56991,3
56991,The bottom is OPEN and the velcro does not stay closed.,56991,3
56991,My little sister still enjoys swimming in it.,56991,3
56991,Other mermaid tails are not cheap.,56991,3
56992,"Good quality, but super snug with very little give.",56992,3
56992,I wish I had ordered a size larger.,56992,3
56993,It was cute but was not flattering for my shape.,56993,3
56993,"I think I was expecting something loose fitting, but to have somewhat of a shape to it.",56993,3
56993,This just hung on me.,56993,3
56993,"I am 5'6"" 120 pounds, size 4 usually if that helps.",56993,3
56994,leather is a little fragile and feels it will break apart pretty fast.,56994,3
56995,"Cute shirt - gave it to my niece as it was too small for me, despite ordering larger than I normally wear.",56995,3
56996,The dress is beautiful but the only problem I couldn't move or walk right in this dress,56996,3
56997,They were larger than expected and quite heavy.,56997,3
56997,I ordered these to wear at the same time as the black pair and they are so large and heavy that I can't wear them together.,56997,3
56998,This Wild West underware is a little smaller then listed.,56998,3
56998,Probably because of based body types!,56998,3
56998,I'll be looking closer to sizing charts in future.,56998,3
56999,I had the same case for my iPhone 5 and it was much thicker than this one.,56999,3
56999,But still a nice case,56999,3
57000,Liked everything about it except the horrible smell.,57000,3
57000,I would of sent it back but I  throughout the packing and envelope it came in.,57000,3
57001,They're great looks exactly like tous jewelr,57001,3
57002,The color is not like the picture it is ligther,57002,3
57003,very thin fabric & not good quality.,57003,3
57003,I can't recommend this one.,57003,3
57004,Would not purchase again,57004,3
57006,Great shirt but came unsewn very quickly.,57006,3
57006,Bought s bigger size!,57006,3
57007,This is the second RDB hat I've owned.,57007,3
57007,The previous one I had I got directly from RDB and it fit much better.,57007,3
57008,Bottom seemed more like a small but the top was true to size.,57008,3
57009,"While this sweater has a nice style and color, it is very thin.",57009,3
57009,The seams along the side were so thin that it actually had a small hole in one spot.,57009,3
57009,"I'll wear this sweater a few times, but it's nothing that's going to last for very long.",57009,3
57009,"I'm afraid that when it comes time to wash it, it'll just fall apart or shrink to nothing.",57009,3
57009,This just isn't good quality.,57009,3
57010,"beige was not my color so I gave it away ( return was not worth the hassle/$) , kept the light green.",57010,3
57010,Pretty short in the front about an inch below the waist.,57010,3
57010,"It's fine for the price, colors are true.",57010,3
57011,"So, at first glance these are very pretty.",57011,3
57011,"Not a high quality item, but they can pass well enough.",57011,3
57011,But the are SO HEAVY.,57011,3
57011,I can't stand feeling my earlobes being dragged down and I'm not sure I'll be able to wear them.,57011,3
57011,"I do really like the shape, and they arrived quickly.",57011,3
57011,"They look fantastic with my ivory and gold dress, but feel like fishing weights...at least to me.",57011,3
57012,"Too small, but it fits my girlfriend!",57012,3
57012,"She's like a My-Size Barbie, coming in at like 5'9, so at least the coat didn't go to waste.",57012,3
57012,She rocks the s*** out of this thing.,57012,3
57012,"If you're a 6' male that clocks in at about 210, broad shoulders and a belly that says you and bacon are old friends, just skip it and buy it as a winter overcoat for your wife.",57012,3
57012,You will not fit in this thing.,57012,3
57012,"It's a good lookin coat, though.",57012,3
57013,Adorable but the colors faded after just a few weeks.,57013,3
57014,Very orange red color.,57014,3
57016,I wear a size 4 in most all clothes and the size 5 was tight fitting.,57016,3
57017,Material is rough and is slightly small for a medium.,57017,3
57017,Trying to wash it a lot to soften the fabric,57017,3
57018,I have only had these flip-flops for less than two weeks and one of the pairs the soles have woren down already and they are making my feet hurt.,57018,3
57019,This top is nowhere near the colour displayed here !,57019,3
57019,"It is actually blue, very blue.",57019,3
57019,It's not a bad colour blue but it is 100% not as it appears here.,57019,3
57019,It is also oversized.,57019,3
57019,Having said that it is comfortable and I love the high neckline.,57019,3
57020,"It's okay, it's pretty and all but uncomfortable to wear on any fingers but my thumb.",57020,3
57020,I had purchased a ring similar to this from QVC and It's more rounded from side to side and the edges are smoother and it is very comfortable.,57020,3
57020,"I thought about sending it back but it would cost about as much to return it as to keep it, so...",57020,3
57021,Love this dres...very pretty as seen online.,57021,3
57021,I went up 1 size according to measurementd but should have gone up 2 sizes I guess.,57021,3
57021,Very disappointed I did not get to wear this to my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary ceremony.,57021,3
57023,Comfortable to work in.,57023,3
57023,Great for working in the hot weather,57023,3
57024,They did somewhat help my feet stop sticking but the material wedged in between my toes which was very annoying.,57024,3
57024,I opted for a yoga towel for hot yoga instead.,57024,3
57025,"I really like this shirt, it looks cute with a pair of jean shorts.",57025,3
57025,It could also be a dressy piece with a skirt and some heels.,57025,3
57025,It's a little smaller than I expected but it still fit.,57025,3
57025,"I would suggest going 2 sizes up from your normal shirt size, and the tie strap makes it a little adjustable in either direction.",57025,3
57026,As I expected the shirts did a great job keeping me cooler than cotton t-shirts did.,57026,3
57027,A bit small for a medium.,57027,3
57028,Really cute and super fun to wear.,57028,3
57028,The finger holes don't work though.,57028,3
57028,Ripped the first time I tried it (before I wore it out).,57028,3
57028,Cheaper alterative than Iheartraves but you must realize it will also be a cheaper made product.,57028,3
57030,"if you have a bigger bottom half, will probably have to go a size up o consider it with maybe leather pants or something.",57030,3
57030,It's really cute just too short to wear out as a dress.,57030,3
57031,Good but too large and the pink is not as light as the picture,57031,3
57032,The dress was absolutely beautiful and the exact mint color we were looking for.,57032,3
57032,The downside is that it wasn't as poofy as we were hoping and as it looks in the picture and the back doesn't have the train.,57032,3
57032,It also took a month longer then expected to arrive.,57032,3
57032,That is why I gave it a 3 star only.,57032,3
57032,If going by quality alone I would have given it a 5 for sure.,57032,3
57033,Very cute but fits tightly in the shoulders and I'm petite!,57033,3
57034,"Great pattern..The quality is cheesy, and the fit is large..but they are ok..",57034,3
57035,I love the onesie just a little disappointed that it's not the size it should be,57035,3
57036,Fit smaller rhan i liked...i won't be returning them though.,57036,3
57037,Though there's a bit of loose thread and it seems very cheap and the top of the hat is kinda awkwardly high.,57037,3
57037,"But, I still rock it and wear it with my blunt bangs :)",57037,3
57038,I bought this shirt for my petite 10 year old who weighs around 50 pounds.,57038,3
57038,It's fitted on her (not too tight but comfortable) but it went down to her knees so I just hemmed it up.,57038,3
57039,"Its okay, its really tight in the thighs, and I have skinny legs I would say",57039,3
57040,It is not fit all size is more like size small only and it easily would fall apart.,57040,3
57041,"It's very cute, but the colorful circles won't stay glued down and the ribbon around the bottom won't stay glued together.",57041,3
57041,"It's still usable and cute, I just wish it would stay together a little better.",57041,3
57042,I'm obsessed with pink camo EVERYTHING so when the bag and wallet was delivered I was SO excited!,57042,3
57042,"The colors, size, style and feel of them both are GREAT however, one of the front zippers on the purse is broke so I can't zip it open or shut without it spreading open in the middle on its own AND the back pocket on the wallet is ripped.. Material is pretty cheap unfortunately.",57042,3
57042,There are good things about this product but there are also some bad.,57042,3
57044,Warm but the legs were too short and I'm barely five feet.,57044,3
57044,The fit is just weird.,57044,3
57044,I got a M/L,57044,3
57045,just confirmed my view that I should try on clothes before buying,57045,3
57046,"I did get a pair of each of the 8 earring designs shown, so 16 earrings total.",57046,3
57046,No need to order two of this item!,57046,3
57046,They are all really cute.,57046,3
57046,"A few of them screw in very tight or sit a bit strangely, so they're not the best quality.",57046,3
57046,"I'm not sure how long they'll hold up either, since they're just plastic.",57046,3
57046,Worth what you pay for them.,57046,3
57047,I purchased this shirt as a gift and was a bit disappointed because it was not true to size.,57047,3
57047,The material was not as I expected.,57047,3
57049,Too small in the top for me.,57049,3
57049,It seemed well made though.,57049,3
57050,The dress was pretty but needed a size smaller.,57050,3
57051,Seems like good quality but was loose in certain places for me.,57051,3
57052,"Looks sexy, but not comfortable to be on for more than a few mins.",57052,3
57052,Good thing they never are.,57052,3
57052,Lol but don't expect to wear these throughout a date.,57052,3
57053,"I'm 5'4"" and I have a waist size of 27in.",57053,3
57053,I ordered a medium which was a pretty good fit but it could have been a little longer.,57053,3
57054,I'm giving these 3 stars because they are not as long as pictured or as fitted at the hem as pictured.,57054,3
57055,"The shirt fits well, with the exception of the arms around the shoulders.",57055,3
57055,The shirt runs slightly tight in this area.,57055,3
57055,I would not recommend it if you have wider shoulders or larger arms.,57055,3
57056,It fits around my abdomen but the straps aren't very stretchy and they dig into my shoulders.,57056,3
57056,The straps outer stitching is what isn't very comfortable as the rest of the material is very stretchy.,57056,3
57056,I can't wear for long periods of time without it turning my shoulders red and leaving an indent.,57056,3
57057,There are very very form fitting.,57057,3
57057,I was expecting it to be just a little loose.,57057,3
57057,"If you are already perfectly fit and want a skin tight shirt and have the confidence for that, than they would probably be great.",57057,3
57059,I really liked these sunglasses.,57059,3
57059,"They are stylish, and I received many compliments on them, however, I only got to wear them twice before they broke.",57059,3
57059,The temple (which connects the glasses to the ear piece) seemingly broke off for no apparent reason,57059,3
57060,"super cute, I am only 5'4"" and these fit below the knee...but I didn't purchase them to wear for a long period of time if you know what I mean ;)
They are loose fitting at teh knee, but my grade school teacher actually taught me to keep knee high socks up with a rubber band under the cuff.",57060,3
57061,Not the same pattern shown nor the same material.,57061,3
57062,"Super cute, but does not fit my newborn.",57062,3
57062,"Even though the size was for newborn, she will be able to wear them until maybe 3 months.",57062,3
57063,It's a great shirt except the color isn't a peachy pink it looks more like Pepto bismo pink,57063,3
57064,"Gold wore off after a while, but I guess that should be expected.",57064,3
57065,"Body part is fine, but underarms and bust are too tight.",57065,3
57066,It did not look as I expected.,57066,3
57066,It was thinner and looked faker than I thought.,57066,3
57066,I bought a pendant to go with it so it looks much better.,57066,3
57066,I grew to like it and wear it everyday and never take it off.,57066,3
57066,I have had it for 8 months now and it looks practically the same as when I first got it.,57066,3
57067,Could be better but overall nice outfit to go out in,57067,3
57068,"It's nice, but it's much bigger than I thought it would be: about four inches long.",57068,3
57069,Made a mistake purchasing this.,57069,3
57069,"It is very, very small and very, very shear.",57069,3
57069,I'm old and big.,57069,3
57070,These fit well but were thinner than expected.,57070,3
57070,I still like them and use them as lounge pants at home.,57070,3
57071,Nice style but I'm not a fan of the material,57071,3
57072,Not my fav nursing gown because of the pull down function.,57072,3
57072,It kind of stretches out so by morning it's sagging so bad with no support that I make coffee looking like I'm gonna fall out of the thing.,57072,3
57072,But other than that it looks great on and supports just right before bed.,57072,3
57073,Just received my delivery today.,57073,3
57073,The metal IS shiny and pinkish and the colored crystals ARE pretty.,57073,3
57073,"Here's where the letdown comes in: the tiny clear crystals on the 'plain' butterfly look more like flat gold dots than distinct 'diamonds,' and more importantly, I do not know what 'resizable' means...",57073,3
57073,THIS IS A PRETTY PINKIE or CHILD'S RING.,57073,3
57073,To be resizable there must be enough band to go smaller or larger (enabling wear on different fingers).,57073,3
57073,That's not possible here.,57073,3
57073,I am keeping it but have no choice but to wear it only on either pinky.,57073,3
57074,Missing several sizes of the different earrings.,57074,3
57075,Cute but runs tight,57075,3
57076,"XS is a bit loose on me (PXS, 5'2"", 105).",57076,3
57076,The upper body looks a bit frumpy due to excessive fabric next to the waist line.,57076,3
57076,"Also, the waist line would be more flattering if a tad higher instead of being in the middle of the dress.",57076,3
57077,"They have an odd fit, like the crotch area was made too low.",57077,3
57078,The item fit but the strap was not sent in the package.,57078,3
57079,"Incredibly Cute Bathing Suit, I am usually an XS or S and the Large was a great fit but...BUT it fell apart at the seams the first time I wore it!",57079,3
57079,"ACK, I guess you get what you pay for but I am going to try to sew it back together",57079,3
57080,I bought this for my tragus and it's really really cute!,57080,3
57080,Only reason for 3 stars is the bar is too short making it extremely difficult to put on.,57080,3
57080,It took my boyfriend and I about an hour amd ten tried to get it on.,57080,3
57080,Other downside is the sharp sides making it uncomfortable to sleep on that side.,57080,3
57081,too small is a Big Prolem.,57081,3
57082,This garment was returned right after I tried it on.,57082,3
57082,Does not work for petite bodies that are short in stature.,57082,3
57083,This was the jewelry that my bridesmaids wore at my wedding.,57083,3
57083,"Very pretty, and simple, but I did have issue with a set breaking that had never been worn.",57083,3
57083,"It is reasonably cheap, so I know that I can't expect too much.",57083,3
57083,"Overall, the set worked out perfectly.",57083,3
57083,"Glad I bought an extra ""just in case"" set for the big day!",57083,3
57084,The closure stopped working after just a few uses.,57084,3
57085,I love the product but the bracelet broke only after two weeks.,57085,3
57086,"The collar itself was cute, but it was borderline tight on my neck when I buttoned the top button.",57086,3
57086,"I have a relatively slender neck, so beware.",57086,3
57087,These were cheap and are cute.,57087,3
57087,However I bought matching PJ's for my girls (size 3 and 4) and the material is completely different in both sets.,57087,3
57087,"As in they don't match, different.",57087,3
57087,"Are they cute, yes.",57087,3
57087,"If you're buying two or more sets to match, however, then don't get your hopes up.",57087,3
57088,"For the price I expected more, these are decent for running but you need some space in your shoes already otherwise these will cramp your feet because your shoes will be too tight on your feet(more of a problem on my end than the insoles themselves).",57088,3
57088,Had some difficulty standing in these all day but they provide support and do not 'mush' down like cheaper insoles.,57088,3
57089,This sweater firs pretty well however the sleeves are a little tight and the material is extremely itchy.,57089,3
57090,Cup is heavier than expected and is not dishwasher safe.,57090,3
57091,Just runs a couple sizes smaller than it said in the description,57091,3
57092,I wish you had it in black.,57092,3
57093,A little uncomfortable at the sleeves.,57093,3
57093,"Wearer wears large, bought large, fits snug.",57093,3
57094,It's cute but too small even though it was marked large.,57094,3
57094,I had no idea it was coming from China.,57094,3
57094,That would have given a clue about the size.,57094,3
57094,They run much smaller in China.,57094,3
57094,I didn't see anything about where it originated.,57094,3
57095,Color is bright and cheerful.,57095,3
57095,"But has a terrible smell that I am hoping will come out when I wash them, if not, will return;",57095,3
57096,Disappointed with how the chain looks.,57096,3
57096,Appears feminine and cheap looking.,57096,3
57096,Pendant is nice however,57096,3
57097,"Not a huge fan of the chain, but over-all the necklace is really cute.",57097,3
57097,My friends ask to borrow often.,57097,3
57097,The chain has darkened over time.,57097,3
57098,I wear a medium but this was a bit big on me so I gave it to my friend who wears a large and worked for her.,57098,3
57098,"The only disappointing thing were the patches on the elbows, they are not positioned on the elbow like the photo they show, more like farther down the arm so they look oddly placed.",57098,3
57100,"I am a size 16, but the top ran excessively large even for me.",57100,3
57101,Everything was great about this costume--except the chest portion.,57101,3
57101,Just because you're a bigger girl does not mean you have 42FFF boobs.,57101,3
57101,"I bought this for my friend, she's a 40B, and I'm not kidding you, the boob part had to have been 6 cup sizes bigger than hers.",57101,3
57101,"I understand hers are probably small for her size, but I'm a 36DD and they were at least 3 sizes bigger than my girls.",57101,3
57101,We had to tape the top to keep it from gaping.,57101,3
57102,I ordered the 13-18 month size for my 3 month old daughter.,57102,3
57102,"Granted my daughter is in the 99th percentile in height, I went with a larger size thinking she could grow into it.",57102,3
57102,"That being said I do like the design and the cotton material, but I think the sizing is off.",57102,3
57102,"Upon arrival and trying it on, the torso fit her well but the arms were too long (easily remedied by rolling the cuffs up once), and the legs were too short.",57102,3
57102,"The outfit looked a little ""high water"" despite me ordering a larger size than needed.",57102,3
57102,"As I said, the arms and torso were plenty big but I was surprised about the leg length.",57102,3
57102,"I rated 3 stars because I like the outfit, it is soft and comfortable.",57102,3
57102,"Plus, as I have known my entire life as being a very tall person, I am not blaming the manufacturer completely for sizing, my daughter is tall, although I think erring on the larger side might be best.",57102,3
57103,"This nose post does not even look as good as the cheap colored glass posts that I bought at K-mart (6 or 8 posts, about $8.00?)",57103,3
57104,"Fit is a bit big, but lined and attractive dress.",57104,3
57105,It is nothing like the pictures.,57105,3
57105,I was expecting an off the shoulder shirt maybe made out of some fabric like cotton.,57105,3
57105,I received the item a lot faster than expected but was slightly disappointed over all.,57105,3
57105,Cute enough to keep but not what I was expecting.,57105,3
57106,Good shoe for the price.,57106,3
57107,I used the size chart and still did not fit across bust area had to return,57107,3
57108,Baby is off center and this is not a maternity shirt but overall it's cute and I get lots of compliments.,57108,3
57108,Would be better if it were priced around $15,57108,3
57109,"Nice little purse, but cheap chain that keeps breaking.",57109,3
57109,Would have gave it 5 stars if not for chain.,57109,3
57111,I got the blue and white while it looks alright the picture looks better.,57111,3
57111,The print isn't as dark of a blue as I thought but it's ok. Just like the picture it is a little see through so I will have to put something under it but I expected that.,57111,3
57111,It is a silky shiny material that will be nice for the summer but I'm not sure how it will wash.,57111,3
57111,"I will say that the shirt did fit as expected, it actually does go past my hips and I can make this work with skinny jeans.",57111,3
57111,So for the price it's not bad.,57111,3
57112,I didn't get 4th free pair,57112,3
57114,"The charm broke off, but still a beauty",57114,3
57115,"One button was missing, but the thing fit.",57115,3
57115,a little snug but it fit.,57115,3
57115,I would suggest hand washing or it might fall apart in the washing machine.,57115,3
57116,"Decent, but not $6 decent.",57116,3
57116,Would not buy again or recommend.,57116,3
57116,"Arrived ahead of time, but moon had jagged metal pieces sticking out which needed to be ground down.",57116,3
57116,"End result looked funky, and the metal was two different colors after the grinding.",57116,3
57117,Bought size small (0-6 mo) for my two month old and they were already too small by the time she was 10 weeks.,57117,3
57117,She weighed 13 lbs at her 2-mo well check-up.,57117,3
57117,I chose the ones with the snaps on the side because I thought they would be easier to take off if she pooped in them.,57117,3
57117,"However, one of the snaps broke they first time we used them.",57117,3
57117,"Otherwise, they are easy to clean and really do contain the mess while baby is in the water.",57117,3
57118,Very thin- you can see right through them,57118,3
57120,Looks like the picture but is kind of an odd shape and short,57120,3
57123,was ok but not quite the quality i expected,57123,3
57124,my phone barely fits in it.,57124,3
57124,the new big smart phone do not fit at all.,57124,3
57125,Didn't like the top of the skirt.,57125,3
57125,Too much of a top band.,57125,3
57126,"I like them, but they are very see through, don't wear this alone.",57126,3
57126,"I wear them under a button down, or just to sleep.",57126,3
57126,"They're comfy until the strap adjusters break, then they just scratch you up.",57126,3
57126,"I've purchased about 10 of these tanks, and the plastic adjusters all eventually broke or snapped off.",57126,3
57126,"At that point, just cut the straps off and sew them into a tube tops or use as a rag.",57126,3
57127,Nice and soft fur.,57127,3
57127,Order 2-3 sizes larger if you wear a sweater underneath,57127,3
57128,The coral runs big?,57128,3
57128,the blue runs small?,57128,3
57128,I don't know what to say except the one in coral fit exactly right and these needed to go back,57128,3
57129,The color is terrible.,57129,3
57129,The material is thin and weird.,57129,3
57130,Too large and not fashionable.,57130,3
57131,"Very large shirt, I wasn't expecting it to be so big.",57131,3
57131,It was still very cute but I'll probably end up donating it because it's too big.,57131,3
57133,"Again, I bought this not knowing that the sizing is radically different from US sizing.",57133,3
57133,It for my daughter who is a size large.,57133,3
57134,pretty but just didn't have the high end look I was I was seeking.,57134,3
57135,"Well, I'm not sure about these.",57135,3
57135,"I can say they do look adorable, and I knew that horizontal stripes would be a big risk on a pear-shaped woman.",57135,3
57135,They're definitely thinner and more delicate than basic brand-name nylons.,57135,3
57135,I don't expect they'll last long before having holes.,57135,3
57135,"What do you expect for the price, though?",57135,3
57135,"As for fit, they're a bit odd.",57135,3
57135,"Unlike most stockings, I had no issue at all with the width.",57135,3
57135,"I'm a size 16 or 18 in pants, depending on the style, and I had zero issues pulling on the 1x/2x - until I got to the top and ran out of length!",57135,3
57135,"I'm just shy of 5'5"", and it was a struggle to stretch them long enough.",57135,3
57135,"I feet like it might be uncomfortable with sitting & standing, but probably tolerable for a short time.",57135,3
57135,"And until that point, I was happy with how they fit without stretching, making them more opaque and maybe less likely to tear.",57135,3
57135,"Hey, I only wear stockings rarely, and I'm sure the stripes will be fun for some odd occasion, so I can set a low bar for comfort & quality on these.",57135,3
57135,"If I planned on wearing them more than a few times, I would look elsewhere.",57135,3
57136,"It was a nice material and the model like very much, but I received an M size...",57136,3
57136,"So, I can't used.",57136,3
57138,"The fit is small and kind of odd, but overall it looks cute enough to wear.",57138,3
57138,"I am not going to return, but I wouldn't buy again.",57138,3
57140,I was expecting these to fit a little differently.,57140,3
57140,They are alright but not the best.,57140,3
57140,I feel as though they are good for casual around the house use but I wouldn't wear them with a tight shirt outside the home as the support just isn't what I need.,57140,3
57141,The bottoms were way too small.,57141,3
57141,The top fit okay.,57141,3
57142,Very cute but thin material and very short,57142,3
57143,It's OK  Quality .,57143,3
57144,"I don't find it very comfortable because it's not holding nursing pads right, they always slip.",57144,3
57144,It does not have build in bra.,57144,3
57144,"Material is regular cotton, a little see throuh.",57144,3
57145,Visually product is very attractive but the bracelet bands are different lengths so it doesn't sit right on my arm with some bands budging or hanging out instead of laying down.,57145,3
57145,Also the items due to the over slack in bands clump up and flip inside out.,57145,3
57145,Since the cost is really low I gave it a 3 star instead of lower.,57145,3
57145,Colors and size are fairly represented just the fit and construction of assembled product are off.,57145,3
57146,In term's of cuality is very good.,57146,3
57146,But I'm a big bootie girl and the bottom part didn't fit at all.,57146,3
57146,Even though I ordered large and I'm usually a medium.,57146,3
57147,"Buyers beware the blue dress, the top is brighter than the bottom.",57147,3
57147,Sorry I didn't pick red.,57147,3
57148,I feel it runs small so I will wash in cold and hang dry.,57148,3
57149,"From the picture, I expected the wig to be more of a cotton candy pink, but it is definitely ""hot pink.""",57149,3
57149,The wig sure itches where it touches my skin...,57149,3
57149,"I look ridiculous, which is what I am going for!",57149,3
57150,Product looks a bit cheap.,57150,3
57150,"Fits well, but doesn't stay in place.",57150,3
57151,I was expecting a slimmer fit shirt.,57151,3
57151,This fits more loose around the chest and shoulders than I was expecting.,57151,3
57151,The torso is also pretty short.,57151,3
57151,I'm 6' 190# and mediums generally fit the way I prefer.,57151,3
57151,"The fabric also seems like 50% spandex, not 5%.",57151,3
57151,It's still a nice shirt and I won't be returning it.,57151,3
57152,The velcro holding the strap on the outside of the shoe by the little toe rubs and creates a blister.,57152,3
57152,Color is more light yellow.,57152,3
57153,"It's so low cut, I would have had to wear a cami under it, but see-through enough that you can then see the cami.",57153,3
57154,"The sides don't light up, somewhat cheap but it's the best alternative to buying a $45-$200 dollar version",57154,3
57156,I bought a pair of these at Macy's and liked it so much I got a second pair on Amazon.,57156,3
57156,"However, this one is slightly different than the one from Macy's, it doesn't fit quite as well, it's a bit smaller, and the holes for the pockets are also smaller.",57156,3
57156,"Should be the exact same considering it's the same size, but it's not...",57156,3
57157,THE BRACELLET NOT VERY RESISTENT.,57157,3
57158,"The ring is comfortable to wear, but I just really didn't like the color.",57158,3
57158,"It is VERY pink, with gold undertones, and would look great on someone with a cool skin tone.",57158,3
57158,"I have a wam skin tone, so I returned this and got the true gold color instead.",57158,3
57159,I have owned several pairs of these pants throughout the years.,57159,3
57159,"I have often purchased them through local stores as well as Amazon, using the same serial or model number-whatever you want to call it.",57159,3
57159,"The material Carhartt has started using is rougher and stiff, probably more durable but the old kind was soft and more comfortable.",57159,3
57159,"The fit is still the same which I like, but the texture/rigidity of them is annoying.",57159,3
57160,"The color of the dresses (Ordered 2 for my bridesmaids) are pretty, but the top is nothing like what it is in this picture.",57160,3
57160,I have never ordered dresses from a place like this and never will again.,57160,3
57160,I ordered my wedding dress form same country and it arrived NOTHING like the picture and smells of fish!!,57160,3
57160,"I am so disappointed with these dresses, no time to order new ones and so we are stuck with them.",57160,3
57160,"They look gorgeous here, but when they arrived,the sequence part is just blah!!",57160,3
57160,very disappointed for sure.,57160,3
57160,I will dress them up with jewelry and hair accessories.,57160,3
57160,At least the color is nice.,57160,3
57161,"I bought XL (12-14) and it fit well for the most part, just not a lot of support in the cup.",57161,3
57161,"The cup size fit me well (I'm a 38D) and wrapped around my body well, just not happy with padded cup shape.. doesn't give lift like picture shows.",57161,3
57161,The bottoms fit well (I'm usually between a size 10-12 pant size).,57161,3
57161,"Overall quality well, just more bummed about cup padding and support.",57161,3
57162,SMALLER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT STURDY,57162,3
57164,The only thing that saved this shirt was that it was in black.,57164,3
57164,Had to send back the mocha because it clung to the stomach even in extra large and waistband showing thru was not cool,57164,3
57166,For a rather baggy style it was tight about the mid torso and did not feel right - had to send it back.,57166,3
57167,They tend to fall off in the night.,57167,3
57167,I most likely will toss them because of this.,57167,3
57168,"Loved the length, but definitely runs small.",57168,3
57168,Order up a size especially if you have a large bust.,57168,3
57169,"led worked for one day in both shoes, one shoe did not re charge....tried to contact tokee but got no replied.",57169,3
57169,"bought another pair of same from re seller and has re charged 20x so must have just been a lemon pair.....ah well,m no reply gets you a 3 should be a 2.",57169,3
57170,Very good for the price!,57170,3
57170,The color does fade the more the fabric stretches.,57170,3
57170,I have thick thighs so the color of the leggings are more dark gray than black.,57170,3
57170,But I love that the design is A-symmetrical.,57170,3
57171,"this is okay, sexyy, but could be better",57171,3
57172,Order like three sizes bigger and they should fit.,57172,3
57173,"Not too impressed with this, I have yet to wear it out.",57173,3
57174,"Tight fit for the insert, which doesn't allow much room for anything else.",57174,3
57174,Would have returned it but the 30 day deadline had passed by the time I returned from the British Isles.,57174,3
57175,"Ordered a large for my size large husband, fits great on him.",57175,3
57175,This is one of the only gym tanks I've ordered for him on Amazon that fit exactly as expected.,57175,3
57177,"loved the hat, fit good, looked good,",57177,3
57178,Nice shoe but too small and uncomfortable,57178,3
57179,Really pretty but cut really tight through chest and shoulders.,57179,3
57180,"Just OK, kind of small, and image is only on one side of the coin.",57180,3
57180,"Still, it looks pretty good though does not appear as golden as in the films.",57180,3
57180,Expensive for what it is.,57180,3
57180,"I would give five stars to the seller, excellent service: arrived on time, securely packaged.",57180,3
57181,Look different than the picture.,57181,3
57181,Does not fit right,57181,3
57182,The only problem I have is the button's being really difficult to open.,57182,3
57182,One of them was jammed in and it messed up when I tried to pull it open.,57182,3
57183,It was to small but I like it have it away for a gift,57183,3
57184,this was too small and so beautiful I was disappointed!,57184,3
57185,Just didn't fit right.,57185,3
57185,"I ordered way up and it fit, just looked odd",57185,3
57186,This product is pretty,57186,3
57187,It's too small Soni can't rate it.,57187,3
57187,I'll have to gift it.,57187,3
57188,Would prefer slightly heavier material.,57188,3
57189,Package was torn and damaged but boots intact and snug when first put on but have actually stretched and been good so far,57189,3
57191,"After one month, I really like the design, but the leather's quality feels a little suspect.",57191,3
57191,The creases that are already showing make me weary about the durability of this wallet.,57191,3
57191,Here's hoping it lasts.,57191,3
57192,This is a cute suit but even the large was just too small for me.,57192,3
57192,"Oh, and if you keep yours, be prepared to find borrow some different bra cookies to put in the top--the ones that are included are small yet deep and will either not cover you or poke out oddly, or both.",57192,3
57192,"When I replaced them with cookies from a sports bra I like, it was fine.",57192,3
57192,"I'm 5'7"" and this was long enough for my torso (slightly adjustable with how high you make the neck), and it's a flattering shape, but it was too tight on the hips (I'm 38.5"" there) and didn't cover my butt crack totally (not a good look).",57192,3
57192,I wear a 4-6 usually and the large didn't work.,57192,3
57193,"They shipped quick, sadly they don't last to long, after about two weeks they split in the middle.",57193,3
57193,"Great price, but not worth the quality.",57193,3
57194,"No support to keep side walls up, turns into a wrinkled mess quickly.",57194,3
57195,I ordered a XXXL because it is Asian made however I wear a L. an XXL would have fit perfectly but it is a pretty nice casual shirt,57195,3
57196,"Cute, I bought a X-large and it fit more like a juniors small, but very cute!",57196,3
57197,"Took a lot of time to get on, prevented me from eating all day.",57197,3
57197,"Felt a few pounds dropped by the end of the week, but as soon as I ate- that bloat was unbearable!",57197,3
57197,"Don't really recommend for weight-loss, good for a night out for an enhanced curvature figure.",57197,3
57197,"Otherwise, just eat right and work out!",57197,3
57197,"buy one size bigger, they run fairly small and you can always adjust!",57197,3
57198,"I'm giving this cap 3 stars based on the fact that it is a little loose on my head and I'm unable to sleep in it, which is why I originally purchased it.",57198,3
57198,"The material is sort of thin but soft, like a t-shirt.",57198,3
57198,I even washed mine (and partially dried it in the dryer) in hopes of shrinking it and it's still too big.,57198,3
57198,"For that reason I'm not going to return it, but I will wear it around the house.",57198,3
57199,Adorable and very versatile.,57199,3
57199,"I wish it had fit better,  I had to give it to my smaller sis.",57199,3
57200,"They work to keep the piercing from closing when not able to have jewelry in, but on darker skin tones it does not blend very well.",57200,3
57200,You can tell there is a spacer in.,57200,3
57201,This is more suited for teenagers and/ or women without butt.,57201,3
57201,"I am 5'6"" 135 lbs.",57201,3
57201,It rides high like just under my butt.,57201,3
57201,I wear it around the house,57201,3
57202,"its a nice material and is very pretty, but it's too small, i got a large but more like a small size.",57202,3
57202,just have to lose weight to fit into it better.,57202,3
57203,This shirt was nice but cheaply made.,57203,3
57205,We ordered this for my daughter.,57205,3
57205,She loves the necklace and the assortment of charms is perfect.,57205,3
57205,The difficulty is getting the charms on and off.,57205,3
57205,You have to pry the ring open each time.,57205,3
57205,I knew this when we ordered it.,57205,3
57205,I wish they had put a spring ring on to make it easier to change the charms.,57205,3
57205,But the necklace is cute.,57205,3
57206,Fit well from sleeves but was long for me bodywise,57206,3
57207,Zipper broke after a week.,57207,3
57207,I just did some sewing because its stretchy enough to still put it on.,57207,3
57207,I'm 5'4 weigh 158.,57207,3
57208,"The deisgn was beautiful, but I ordered it too large.",57208,3
57208,"I'll also mention, the coloring of the cream/off-white does look more like a beige when received.",57208,3
57209,The color supposed to be red and it is coral.,57209,3
57210,Too big for my babe.,57210,3
57211,"It was missing a couple of rhinestones, but nothing glue can't fix!",57211,3
57213,Adorable hat decently made thankfully I read previous reviews to know that the hat runs small so I ordered a medium based on reviews.,57213,3
57213,They're absolutely right it runs way too small it'll fit my newborn daughter for a very short Time,57213,3
57214,This ring is adorable.,57214,3
57214,I love how simple it is and that it isn't too obviously a cat.,57214,3
57214,It's very cute and it is very easy to change the size of it if you want to wear it on different fingers.,57214,3
57214,"With the changing size though, the ring isn't made very strongly so you need to be careful how often you change the size or else the spot in the middle of the ring gets very brittle and seems like it would be very easy to accidentally break.",57214,3
57215,"The color is good, the gloves were too small.",57215,3
57215,I have long fingers and the XL was still too short.,57215,3
57215,"Also the packaging had moved around somehow so that there was glue residue on the gloves, I don't know how to get that off.",57215,3
57215,I hope it will wear off for whomever I pass these on to.,57215,3
57215,I was disappointed because the color was perfect.,57215,3
57216,Cute - but too tight.,57216,3
57216,I am a woman with curves.,57216,3
57216,So when I order and XL (14/16) I expect it to fit that way.,57216,3
57216,But it's very tight in the mid section on down and I do not have a big tummy.,57216,3
57217,"Oh man, this romper looked so good in the picture and so bad when I tried it on X) It was a little too big.",57217,3
57217,I usually wear size 6/8 but should perhaps have ordered size 4/6.,57217,3
57217,"But even in a slightly smaller size, it would probably have looked weird on me.",57217,3
57217,"First of all, there was a lot of fabric in the crotch area.",57217,3
57217,"Secondly, I have big boobs and the top did not cover them at all.",57217,3
57217,Half of my bra was visible.,57217,3
57217,"And without a bra, half of my boob would have been visible.",57217,3
57217,"In general, the whole thing was not very flattering.",57217,3
57217,"Too bad, it looked so good in the pictures.",57217,3
57217,"I think this romper could still look pretty good on a tall, skinny person with smaller boobs.",57217,3
57219,"Pretty shoes, the foot fit great, but the calves were not wide enough to feel comfortable.",57219,3
57221,"These are so pretty, and didn't get itchy , which seems to happen to me frequently.",57221,3
57221,But the reason I gave 3 stars is for the fit.,57221,3
57221,I have nursed 2 babies.,57221,3
57221,"My nipples fill the space, which looks fine, but does not allow me to clean them well.",57221,3
57221,I really do like the concept of the snap closure!,57221,3
57222,I expected the shirt more tight fitting and it was extremely oversized for me.,57222,3
57222,Biggest xl shirt I've ever bought.,57222,3
57223,But the material is thin and very staticky in winter.,57223,3
57224,It had a funny smell on it.,57224,3
57225,Beads don't stay in place they go all over the bracelet.,57225,3
57225,It's cute but unless the pieces are right it wouldn't look right.,57225,3
57225,I have small wrists and am petite so it's loose and the pieces do slide around on the bands.,57225,3
57225,I'm going to figure out a way to get them to stay in place and not slide.,57225,3
57225,Once i do that i believe it will be just fine.,57225,3
57226,Gave exact measurements and still huge.,57226,3
57226,Measurements were done by a taylor.,57226,3
57226,Cost another 50$ to make it fit.,57226,3
57226,But nicely made otherwise,57226,3
57227,The jeans are really cute.,57227,3
57227,Not stretchy material at all.,57227,3
57227,"They are in Junior sizes, not women's.",57227,3
57228,This sweater is very cute!,57228,3
57228,But it does not fit like the picture.,57228,3
57228,"I am a medium, I ordered the largest size, but it barely hits my waist.",57228,3
57228,I figured that when I ordered it but was still a little disappointed.,57228,3
57228,However I work with old folks and they LOVE the kitty.,57228,3
57229,"I really like how warm these leggings are, but they were a bit too large and also had a strange smell.",57229,3
57229,"I've tried washing them and airing them out a bit, but they still smell strange to me.",57229,3
57229,"Also, the material is already pilling and I've only worn them once.",57229,3
57229,"So, I'm not sure how long they'll last for.",57229,3
57230,"Beautiful and well made, but it runs way small.",57230,3
57230,Would recommend buying at least 1 size larger.,57230,3
57231,When item arrived links ans size of chain & bracelet very large-good for large person.,57231,3
57231,"Should include diameter size in description, waste of $.",57231,3
57231,Could not give as gift,57231,3
57233,broke after wearing it for a few days,57233,3
57234,I gave it to a teenager and he liked it.,57234,3
57235,These din't fit my face very will,57235,3
57236,Top is pretty thin not so soft.,57236,3
57236,Great price but not what I was hoping for,57236,3
57237,these all seem to be a bit too thick and short for my liking.,57237,3
57237,"This color is really a deep raspberry, looking for something to wear it with, expected pinker color.",57237,3
57238,are a bit too long for normal capris and feel different from other yoga work out pants but are good for the price.,57238,3
57239,Product is fine but very slow shipping.,57239,3
57240,When tightened the jewels do not face the same way.,57240,3
57241,Warm and cozy but the fit is off.,57241,3
57241,They run a full size too big these medium size fits my size 11 husband perfectly... Too bad they don't fit me since I purchased for my size 8.5 feet.,57241,3
57242,Good thing I ordered an XL it runs really small!,57242,3
57243,It was a lil too small but my husband loved it...,57243,3
57244,"Cute dress, but it did run a little big.",57244,3
57244,It was very comfortable and I got lots of compliments.,57244,3
57244,I do run smaller in the chest area and do recommend this dress to someone who has a larger chest.,57244,3
57244,"Otherwise, you have to put tape on the dress so you do not fall out.",57244,3
57245,good quality and works well but not worth the price !,57245,3
57246,But I was hoping for more stunning array of bright colors!,57246,3
57247,"Small for a XXX, but I like it.",57247,3
57248,"The bathing suit was pretty,  just no support for the girls.",57248,3
57249,"If you want to show off your ass, this is great but the slits are short enough that you'll get a good view.",57249,3
57249,Not the statement I was looking to make.,57249,3
57249,"I'm 5' 2"" so not a good choice for taller ladies.",57249,3
57250,"It's cute, but It's way small.",57250,3
57251,"Cute gift package but the tie is very small, like a toy.",57251,3
57251,This just didn't suit me so I returned.,57251,3
57252,shorter than expected and a little snug.,57252,3
57253,Was thinking itd be leather for some reason  ?,57253,3
57253,Its also a bit smaller than i thought,57253,3
57254,Its good but a little too big for a belt item.,57254,3
57255,It was worth what I paid for it...,57255,3
57256,"Fits good, but too light.",57256,3
57257,"Quick fast shipping beautiful ring so many complement however,  lost a diamond on top, only used about 3  Times.",57257,3
57258,The Earrings themselves I love.,57258,3
57258,"smaller and almost white rather than the shown blueish color,that I anticipated.",57258,3
57258,"However, they took FOREVER to be shipped!",57258,3
57258,"So, if you need these in a hurry.....buy something else or move to China!",57258,3
57259,"I loved the color and material however, again in a size 10 woman's figure, it's a bit tight in the bust and a little on the short side.",57259,3
57259,going to keep it in hopes I may find a time to wear it.,57259,3
57259,I need to be more familiar with overseas sizing when looking at these dresses.,57259,3
57260,It was a little tighter than I expected.,57260,3
57261,I love this dress is so pretty it just doesn't fit and I order 2 sizes up and it still didn't zip!,57261,3
57262,One of the jewels had fallen out of the bracket on one of the earrings.,57262,3
57262,"Also, the jewels are much larger than I would have preferred.",57262,3
57263,I'd read the reviews how their sizing is small.,57263,3
57263,So I ordered a large.,57263,3
57263,It's still smaller than I'd like.,57263,3
57263,"I haven't washed yet, so concerned that they'll be too small afterwards.",57263,3
57264,This product is so/so.,57264,3
57264,Not bad for the price but not worth purchasing twice.,57264,3
57264,Metal boning has come through bottom after one wear.,57264,3
57265,This is a decent product.,57265,3
57265,"The tail fell off of where the safety pin goes, so I had to sew it together.",57265,3
57265,The ears are good quality and the collar fits around my neck (thank goodness for velcro).,57265,3
57265,"Overall, be aware of the tail with this set!",57265,3
57266,Tighter than Large usually fits in waist .,57266,3
57266,I bought particularly because it has pockets & those are smaller than I was hoping for.,57266,3
57266,Still it is a cute skirt.,57266,3
57267,"ral color is lighter, not as dark as it seems",57267,3
57268,Top is see-thru and does not stay in place very well.,57268,3
57268,Bottoms are a little small.,57268,3
57268,"Would be better if top was lined, and stayed on.",57268,3
57269,It's very thin but extremely sticky.,57269,3
57269,It doesn't come with a case that you can store it in to prevent it from sticking to other stuff,57269,3
57270,"Like the wallet itself, lots of pockets--the cross fell off within the 1st week of use though",57270,3
57271,"The lettering falls off after one wash. 8 love the sure, but the silk screen lettering is a disappointment",57271,3
57272,The top has no structure and is unwearable.,57272,3
57272,"I'm not well endowed, but the top wasn't flattering at all.",57272,3
57272,"Pretty pattern, so I switched the top out and wore the bottoms with another top.",57272,3
57272,"Make sure to check the sizing chart, because it runs EXTREMELY small.",57272,3
57273,UPDATE: I am adding a star back for GREAT customer service!,57273,3
57273,Although I was unhappy with the product the price wasn't worth the time to return it.,57273,3
57273,They contacted me based in the below review and refunded my order completely.,57273,3
57273,"For this reason, although not happy with the product, I would recommend buying from this company.",57273,3
57273,I think this is a nice material and the pom poms are so fun!,57273,3
57273,However I am SO DISAPPOINTED in the style!,57273,3
57273,I didn't see any indication that this was a poncho with a hole for your head and no sleeves!,57273,3
57273,I am a petite person and length is also disappointing.,57273,3
57273,"It was cheap enough that I don't know if I will bother to go through the return and refund process, but I will not be wearing it.",57273,3
57274,This is a great shirt but the color starts cracking right away after you wash it.,57274,3
57275,These are soft and I like them but they don't hold their shape they stretch out easy,57275,3
57276,"Loved it, but it turned brass very quickly; but for the price that was paid that was expected!",57276,3
57277,The under lining is just too short,57277,3
57278,Cool hat but kinda smashed.,57278,3
57278,"I can kind of pop back into place but as soon as I wear it, it looks smashed again.",57278,3
57279,chain was really small,57279,3
57280,"Seemy to be really good quality especially for the price,however not happy with the size of em",57280,3
57282,I love the shirt!,57282,3
57282,It's just too small!,57282,3
57283,"Size XXXL(tag) fits like a Large, size XXL(tag) fits like a medium, etc.",57283,3
57283,"Seems ok for the price, if you need a true XL or larger don't buy.",57283,3
57284,I love this shirt just wish it fit better/larger...,57284,3
57284,I was hoping to wear it as a comfortable fitting pajama shirt but it's too small...,57284,3
57285,really loved the color and they were very soft.,57285,3
57285,"However, the inseam had no real elasticity to it.",57285,3
57285,I stand 5 feet and only 117 pounds.,57285,3
57285,"You may

want to order a size larger with this product.",57285,3
57286,"It was what I ordered and I was super excited to recieve it however, it is NOT a flex hat and is in fact too small, I cant wear it.",57286,3
57287,Really cute but when I got them the hole for the button was sealed and the size I ordered wasn't even remotely close to what I order and the zipper was missing when I got them.,57287,3
57288,"Really cute, looks just like the photos but didn't fit.",57288,3
57288,"If you have no boobs, don't even try it.",57288,3
57288,"I wear a M, bought a M and the butt-part fit perfectly, but the top was so ridiculously big.",57288,3
57288,i'm a DIY-er and even I had to give up on trying to fix it.,57288,3
57289,"Five stars, but overpriced.",57289,3
57290,I didn't get a choose of size - I really wish these didn't fit so snugly.,57290,3
57290,"I'm 4'11 and I weigh 102 and these just barely fit - They feel too tight, but I'll wear them anyway.",57290,3
57290,They're just not comfortable.,57290,3
57291,The back was shorter then the front and the size seems to run a little small.,57291,3
57292,I ordered a large and was sent a 3XL for some reason.,57292,3
57292,It's only a little baggy though and there is little to no bra support.,57292,3
57292,The white lace sticks up on the edges.,57292,3
57292,Hopefully I can find a friend that will want it.,57292,3
57293,This is a really pretty dress but I would order a size bigger than what you are.,57293,3
57293,"Also, you may want to wear a slip underneath because you can see directly through this material.",57293,3
57293,It's a veryfit and flare type of dress so it hugs the top of your body past until you are past the hips.,57293,3
57293,It's comfortable and will be wearing it a lot this summer.,57293,3
57294,"Fits nice, but the collar is huge in height, makes me feel like I'm wearing an Elvis shirt.",57294,3
57295,"Nice case, although the watch ""molds"" which you use to clasp your watches around are too large and made of a solid material.",57295,3
57295,This can put undue strain on your straps if you try to close them around the molds.,57295,3
57296,Ir doesn't look flare like the photo,57296,3
57298,Its nice but it looks different online,57298,3
57299,looks good for the money.,57299,3
57300,Too long for 5ft5in woman,57300,3
57301,Not what I expected but will keep it.,57301,3
57302,I ordered this in navy.,57302,3
57302,"The color is deep and bright, and the wristlet looks rather high quality.",57302,3
57302,It fits my Galaxy S6 with a thicker case.,57302,3
57302,"I really liked it, but after four months of daily use the wrist loop broke off.",57302,3
57302,"Maybe I shouldn't expect that the leather loop that I tug on several times a day should stay attached for longer than four months, but I'm disappointed.",57302,3
57302,I won't be replacing it with the same thing.,57302,3
57302,I recommend this if you're the type who wants a nice-looking wristlet that you won't use every day or that you plan to replace after three months of use.,57302,3
57303,Large in the bust area.,57303,3
57304,"BUT, because of the handles the zippered main section of the bag is much smaller than the actual measurements of the bag.",57304,3
57304,The 3 ring binder that I intended to carry in it would not fit.,57304,3
57304,The actual height of the zippered compartment is 10 inches.,57304,3
57304,"Sadly, I am returning the bag.",57304,3
57305,I bought these in a large because I was getting a breast augmentation.,57305,3
57305,When I bought these I was a 34A & they already fit pretty snug.,57305,3
57305,"The day after my boob job, I went in for my post-op appointment where they would take off my bandage & put a soft bra on me.",57305,3
57305,I only went up about a cup & a half in bra sizes (I got 350cc implants) but these were not even close to zipping up.,57305,3
57305,Idk what these sizes are based on but they run extremely small.,57305,3
57305,Other than the sizing being off these sports bras were pretty comfy & had good support.,57305,3
57305,The only thing I had an issue with when wearing it was the bottom of the zipper kept rubbing against my sternum.,57305,3
57307,I found the jackets run smaller than what I  had anticiparse I would Ordering it again but  it  doesn't !,57307,3
57308,The sleeves were very tight,57308,3
57309,"Item was somewhat small, runs a size small and very see through, overall great for the price.",57309,3
57310,Fabric is heavier and stiffer than I expected,57310,3
57311,The material was thinner than I'd like but the color was pretty true.,57311,3
57311,"I have a boxy torso, so this shirt just accentuated that and made me look really big on top.",57311,3
57311,Unfortunately it's not for me.,57311,3
57314,The large was a little snug for someone who is size 12.,57314,3
57314,"Material is thin, but not see through.",57314,3
57314,I love the design so I will still where them.,57314,3
57315,Too large of a hat,57315,3
57317,Very thin material but overall not a bad sweater,57317,3
57318,I'm 5'11 and weigh 150 lbs.,57318,3
57318,The suit barley covers my breast as I have a long torso.,57318,3
57318,"However the material is quality enough, but has limited stretch.",57318,3
57319,I love this bag.,57319,3
57319,I love oversized purses and this one fits the bill.,57319,3
57319,"it could be an overnight bag or a perfect carry on, or even a diaper bag.",57319,3
57319,"I have to give it only three stars though because while it's nice a sturdy otherwise, the zipper on the back pocket where I keep my keys, phone, and other items I need often broke after the first month of using the bag.",57319,3
57319,the zipper pull fell off and therefore that pocket is pretty much unusable.,57319,3
57319,"then the zipper on one of the inside pockets where I HAD been storing those items since the back zipper busted broke as well, and I couldn't get to those items without having to cut a hole in the pocket itself.",57319,3
57319,"overall the quality is decent, but I expected it to last much longer.",57319,3
57319,I've been carrying it for four months now and finally got around to buying something else because two of the storage pockets aren't functional any longer.,57319,3
57320,the band is too tight and too small.,57320,3
57320,I can only wear this on my pinky and it's still tight and clunky.,57320,3
57321,Really liked it but it fell apart as i put it on and I returned it.,57321,3
57322,Beautiful but impossible to put on.,57322,3
57322,Should come with some sort of tool to pop the bead in.,57322,3
57323,I bought a similar one a few months back in black and it fit just right( I am bustier) but this was hugs me..I wouldnt say it was too small but it is very fitted.,57323,3
57324,nice tulle skirt however the waistband was not assembled correctly.,57324,3
57324,It flips as it goes around the waist therefore it does not lay properly.,57324,3
57325,Because I had to pay to alter it.,57325,3
57325,"I gave it 3 stars, it's a great piece but prepare to spend a little on alterations.",57325,3
57325,Went to Hawaii and received so my complaints !,57325,3
57326,Does not have enough material for a thicker muscular thigh.,57326,3
57326,"FIT: The material is thin and comfortable but if you usually buy palazzo pants because the excess material of a palazzo flatters your body type, be advised these pants are form fitting on a curvy body.",57326,3
57326,"There is a fair amount of material from the knee down, but no flattering flow from the knee up.",57326,3
57326,"HEMMING: These pants on a short 5'4"" frame were WAY too long, in order to hem them I would have lost the entire bottom print along the hem which would have drastically changed the pretty ethnic print.",57326,3
57326,"If you have short legs, go with a smaller print in the first place.",57326,3
57326,These would make great lounge PJs but not pants to wear in public.,57326,3
57326,Returned BUT I really appreciate how quickly the refund was processed.,57326,3
57327,Beautiful boots but ran way too small had to return.,57327,3
57328,I wore this for a few days it bent on me and the magnet came out..,57328,3
57329,"Absolutely love the look, fit and feel.",57329,3
57329,The size was spot on and they're tight enough that they don't fall down but they're soft enough that they are really comfortable.,57329,3
57329,The only thing is there is a small tear in the crotch and I've only worn them two or three times.,57329,3
57329,I'll sew it up and hope it doesn't happen again!,57329,3
57329,If the tear didn't happen I would buy ten more pair.,57329,3
57330,"Yes, it will give you a butt lift, but it looks weird on the lower part of your butt.",57330,3
57331,"They are very soft and warm, but unfortunately, they shed...a lot!",57331,3
57332,Great material and nice look but it is much smaller than expected.,57332,3
57332,Recommend purchasing a size up for sure.,57332,3
57334,Dress was perfect BUT the jacket was HUGE!!,57334,3
57334,Tried to get company to redo it but they said because it was a custom fit they couldn't....,57334,3
57334,I feel it was their error because the dress did fit perfect!,57334,3
57334,Very satisfied with the dress!!,57334,3
57334,very dissatisfied with the jacket and they way the company would not redo it.,57334,3
57335,"My 6 month old admittedly has a large head (94%ile) but I had read reviews that this hat would work for a while with their child, like up to 9 or 10 months old.",57335,3
57335,That definitely would not be the case for my daughter.,57335,3
57335,I feel like the hat runs small.,57335,3
57335,I will probably send it back since she will not get to wear it for very long at all.,57335,3
57336,"These are super cute glasses, but HUGE.",57336,3
57336,"If you are allergic to nickel like I am, wear at your own risk.",57336,3
57336,"I personally broke out in a rash so can no longer wear these ... but they make a great pair of glasses for dressing up rather than daily ""style"" wear (unless you're into the whole bigger is better!)",57336,3
57337,It is okay I supposed.,57337,3
57337,"Fabric isn't super thick, took forever to arrive, but it fits.",57337,3
57338,Very thin and delicate for a sweater in my opinion.,57338,3
57338,Just not cozy comfy.,57338,3
57339,"I don't mind some sideboob, but if you do, be careful of purchasing this top!",57339,3
57339,I'm an average sized girl with C-cup breasts and I've found it hard to make the top really fit appropriately.,57339,3
57339,The ties are a bit awkward--I have to tie them tightly to fit my small frame but my breasts them pop out.,57339,3
57339,"Otherwise, the top is too loose.",57339,3
57339,"I think it still looks good, though!",57339,3
57339,"I really do like the top, but the fitting could be improved.",57339,3
57340,Handle broke during first vacation,57340,3
57341,"This is pretty crappily made, I'm not going to lie, but with a few adjustments you can make it work.",57341,3
57341,"I bought this as a last minutes piece for my mad hatter cosplay outfit, so I didn't have time to alter it as I needed to, but I made it work.",57341,3
57341,"Quick shipping though, packaging was adequate.",57341,3
57342,It was beautiful but would only fit a child.,57342,3
57342,Giving it to my great granddaughter today.,57342,3
57343,Runs smaller as an XXL.,57343,3
57344,a lot smaller than i expected,57344,3
57345,it's pretty but it barely glows (even in the dark).,57345,3
57346,"These were really great at first, but they somehow became very ragged, very fast.",57346,3
57346,"Yes, my son is rough and tumble.",57346,3
57346,"He plays outside, etc.",57346,3
57346,But the way the shoe laces have literally just come apart is baffling to me.,57346,3
57346,We can't even tie them anymore because of all the wear and tear...,57346,3
57347,"Great color and easy to put on, but it runs really small.",57347,3
57350,Poufy-ier  than I was expecting but good quality,57350,3
57351,The chain is shorter then I expected.,57351,3
57352,I love the dress jut a little shorter than I expected.,57352,3
57353,They seem to be a bit bulky for my rings,57353,3
57354,"Super cute ring but it has a divot in the mood ring part and it was supposed to come with a mood ring chart, which it didn't.",57354,3
57355,They're a bit hard to walk in.,57355,3
57355,Feel very flat footed.,57355,3
57356,No more Carhart for me,57356,3
57357,Small in the sleeves.,57357,3
57357,The rest fit fine,57357,3
57359,"really light frame that can be consider ""cheap""...",57359,3
57360,thought it would look a little better than it does.,57360,3
57361,Quality is good but it was just way to small and I already opened up packaging so couldn't return.,57361,3
57361,"I'm 85 lbs and 4'11"" and didn't think a medium wasn't going to fit",57361,3
57362,Fabric is rough and waistband was loose on me (5'0 103 lbs).,57362,3
57363,I love the colors on these skirts.,57363,3
57363,The fabric however is too thin.,57363,3
57363,I ordered this along with some Alki'i  skirts and the fabric of those skirts was a much better quality.,57363,3
57363,These skirts look old after a couple wears.,57363,3
57364,"Pretty dress, but it was very large around the bust area (34b).",57364,3
57364,"Plus, it's a bit long for me.",57364,3
57364,"On the upside, the fabric is thick and it's a beautiful light pinkish color.",57364,3
57364,Not at all cheaply made.,57364,3
57365,Not as large as I thought or need.,57365,3
57366,I love the style of these pants.,57366,3
57366,Around ankle there's a scrunchy that keeps the pants from touching the floor.,57366,3
57366,"My only complaint is that sometimes that scrunchy rides up my calf, and uncomfortably constricts my calf.",57366,3
57366,"That being said, I still wear these pants a lot, and they are very comfortable.",57366,3
57367,when its unzipped it s a little better but I should have gotten a size up.,57367,3
57368,Color isn't a white as Its displayed but its nice.,57368,3
57368,And I never received any cufflinks.,57368,3
57369,It's pretty but cheaply made.,57369,3
57370,The middle stone is very dark.,57370,3
57371,Cat design was sewn on a little crooked and needed to be ironed flat.,57371,3
57371,Other than that the hat itself is nice and warm.,57371,3
57372,Material was very stinky,57372,3
57373,Pros:  The quality is better than I expected at this price point ($9).,57373,3
57373,"It felt comfortable, sewn well.",57373,3
57373,Cons:  Only one size!,57373,3
57373,"A bit too tight to clench with flexibility, which is important for the task of driving.",57373,3
57373,"It was too small for me, so it will be a gift for my sister who has more slender fingers.",57373,3
57374,"It is not bad, as on 35$...",57374,3
57374,But does not protect from beam lights on 100%.,57374,3
57374,Maybe 70%... That's  why 3 stars...,57374,3
57376,I bought to dress up as Disgust from Inside Out.,57376,3
57376,It did the job.,57376,3
57376,Note: It doesn't wash well.,57376,3
57376,"After first wash, color faded in spots.",57376,3
57377,This is the one I liked but would not recommend.,57377,3
57377,"It keeps falling apart, zipper pulls falling off and zippers breaking or not working right.",57377,3
57377,It looks nice but.....time to stick to the brands I know and love.,57377,3
57378,So elegant and pretty.,57378,3
57378,Perfect for my style.,57378,3
57379,It's a cute romper so I gave it to my neighbor.,57379,3
57380,They run really small,57380,3
57381,Top was great for a 36DD.,57381,3
57381,Bottoms didn't come up high enough and were too snug.,57381,3
57381,"I'm 5'6"" and between 12 and 14 size.",57381,3
57381,"Style very cute, but had to return",57381,3
57382,could of been a little more comfortable,57382,3
57383,"Fits small, maybe if I had a smaller chest this would look alot better.",57383,3
57384,Had an issue with the size.,57384,3
57384,Contacted the company and they fixed it.,57384,3
57384,My order had a different top then what was shown.,57384,3
57384,Will be getting the new outfit shortly will keep everyone updated.,57384,3
57385,Not very good material.,57385,3
57385,Flimsy and didn't fit my face.,57385,3
57385,Simply threw it out..,57385,3
57386,The top fits but the bottom is too big.,57386,3
57386,It is not like the picture it has blue sapphire type decals in the top and around the rim of the waist of the skirt.,57386,3
57386,It is very pretty but the picture they have it very deceiving.,57386,3
57387,"Love the dress, but had to go up two sizes, and the bust is still a little tight.",57387,3
57388,I ordered one for my wife not knowing she had already ordered one for herself.,57388,3
57388,"Unfortunately, her first one broke after several days of wearing it, the reason for the 3 stars.",57388,3
57388,"It is very nice looking costume jewelry, though.",57388,3
57389,Liked charm but was disappointed that American flag was not on both sides of charm.,57389,3
57390,Beautiful dress.... Just a little bit snug but material good.... even though a little thin.,57390,3
57390,Plan to wear slip,57390,3
57391,I bought this for my daughter in a small and it's huge.,57391,3
57391,Sleeves too long as well.,57391,3
57392,Didn't care for white dots,57392,3
57393,The material is soft to touch and expands to suit your body.,57393,3
57393,The size is somewhat small.,57393,3
57393,Need one size larger if you like this dress.,57393,3
57394,"I thought the bottom was a higher waist, but is still nice.",57394,3
57394,The only thing I didn't like was the wires in the top were already coming out and poking me,57394,3
57395,"i thought the sweater was thicker LOL, but my daughter still loves it",57395,3
57396,It's very comfortable but the material is very thin.,57396,3
57396,You can see my underwear right through it.,57396,3
57397,Size cart is wrong for this item.,57397,3
57397,He can't wear it for two more years.,57397,3
57398,OK LITTLE TO BIG FOR ME,57398,3
57399,Love the tank but it runs a few sizes small,57399,3
57401,Just needed it a Lil bigger,57401,3
57402,Huge in the  crotchal region.,57402,3
57402,I could have fit a circus in there,57402,3
57403,"Eh--- it does the trick if you're just chillin and not going to be seen by anyone, but the inside ties are awkwardly placed and make the robe's pockets poof out if you use them.",57403,3
57403,"Even if you don't, the robe seems to puff out at the pockets anyway.",57403,3
57403,"It is soft though and i love the length of the sleeves, falls barely past my wrists with nice big cuffs.",57403,3
57404,quality not the best.,57404,3
57405,not bad for the money,57405,3
57406,The material was very thin.,57406,3
57407,"Really cool shoes but they are 1 size reduced, I ordered size 7 and they fit like a size 6.",57407,3
57408,This is a good product.,57408,3
57408,I do not recommend wearing all day.,57408,3
57408,The knees can be taken out of alignment when using the gel pack.,57408,3
57409,I have a weird body I guess.,57409,3
57409,The waist was somewhat small.,57409,3
57409,The holes for your cheeks were way too big.,57409,3
57409,It lifted them up a little but I couldn't tell much of a difference with my clothes on.,57409,3
57410,Bought this for my mom because it's impossible to find brown sweatshirts.,57410,3
57410,"It's ok, but seems more boyish.",57410,3
57411,"Top fit good, bottoms were too small but for the price paid it was a great buy!",57411,3
57412,I thought it was very cheaply made,57412,3
57413,not the best material,57413,3
57414,This skirt is cut large.,57414,3
57414,"I wear a small and ordered this size, but the overall cut is too large.",57414,3
57414,"There's a bit too much fabric and so in wearing it, it looks as if I ordered a size too large.",57414,3
57414,I probably will not be wearing it often.,57414,3
57414,"Though it's below the knee, it's too long on me.",57414,3
57415,Not at all like the picture.,57415,3
57415,It's more of an actual tote bag with color to it.,57415,3
57415,"I like the bag itself, but I'm glad I got it for 20 bucks because it's not worth the 60 original.",57415,3
57416,"it's a beautiful dress, but on my 5'0"" frame, it drags on the floor.",57416,3
57417,"Good quality, doesn't stretch much though and it was uncomfortable because of that.",57417,3
57417,I'll be gifting it to someone with a smaller head!,57417,3
57418,I ordered for myself but did not like the way they fit.,57418,3
57418,"They fitted small, so I gave the jeans to my dsughter.",57418,3
57420,"My favorite belt finally needed to be replaced and I looked everywhere for what I now know is called a ""plaque"" design.",57420,3
57420,This belt is just that is of decent quality.,57420,3
57420,The buckle part is just a bit odd.,57420,3
57420,I don't know why they designed it to have a bit of the leather stick out past the metal.,57420,3
57420,It doesn't look too good in person because of that.,57420,3
57421,LOVE the look of this item.,57421,3
57421,I was very surprised for the price when I received it because it was just so beautiful.,57421,3
57421,I wore it maybe 10x and the finish started to get tarnished and spotty.,57421,3
57421,What a shame because I really enjoyed this piece!,57421,3
57425,Not 100% but ok.,57425,3
57426,Runs way smaller than size projects,57426,3
57427,It's pretty but it tangles a lot while wearing it.,57427,3
57428,"The hat was a little bent, but I was able to somewhat straighten that out.",57428,3
57428,"The (small) size was to bit for me, however I have a very small head.",57428,3
57429,"Disappointed as the frame arrived in a small plastic bag, not in a case as exoected.",57429,3
57429,"Otherwise, ok frame for the price.",57429,3
57430,Not very long and very big,57430,3
57431,I gave it 3 stars because its really cute.,57431,3
57431,But my granddaughter is 3 and very small and this is very tight.,57431,3
57432,"Like the style and overall fit, but this runs small.",57432,3
57432,Bought an XL/XXL and it gives me a headache after 30 minutes.,57432,3
57432,"I have an Adidas L/XL that fits the same way, but have a Nike L/XL that fits more comfortably.",57432,3
57432,Thought the XXL would do the trick but it is tighter than expected.,57432,3
57433,I bought this dress in black and absolutely love it!,57433,3
57433,So I was very excited to order another one.,57433,3
57433,But unfortunately I wasn't as pleased with this one.,57433,3
57433,THe material is nothing like the black one.,57433,3
57433,The quality just isn't the same.,57433,3
57433,"It says it's made by the same company, but I'm not completely sold on it.",57433,3
57433,"But for the price, it's not too bad.",57433,3
57433,Just disappointed that the quality wasn't the same as my black one.,57433,3
57434,It can with one of the stones chipped unfortunately & it started tarnishing within a week :(,57434,3
57435,Nice looking but tie but tag on back tore off easily while tying.,57435,3
57436,"Although I usually wear a size 2X for comfort, based on reviews of this shirt, I ordered a size 3X.",57436,3
57436,I am very disappointed with the fit.,57436,3
57436,"I do like the fabric and color, so I will wear the shirt when I also have a jacket on the cover the ""snugness.""",57436,3
57437,The top was perfect fitting and I love it but the shorts were so huge,57437,3
57438,It ran very small.,57438,3
57439,These leggings are warm and nice imitation of jeans.,57439,3
57439,But they are falling down at the waist.,57439,3
57439,The cut is strange and not good; too high in front and too low in back.,57439,3
57440,It rides up as soon as you bend over.,57440,3
57440,I hoped it wouldn't move around so much.,57440,3
57442,Color was different than photo.,57442,3
57442,It is bright yellow rather than the gold in the photo.,57442,3
57442,My daughter decided to wear it anyway!,57442,3
57443,Really nice my girl loves it but not so great packaging.,57443,3
57444,Seemed a little short.,57444,3
57445,"Smaller than expected, but cute.",57445,3
57446,"I ordered 2 of these shirts one in a different print, they are both 2XL.",57446,3
57446,One fits like and XL the other like a Large,57446,3
57447,"The dress is really cute, just ran small and has no stretch except in waist.",57447,3
57448,Runs very very small.,57448,3
57448,I reccomend ordering 2 sizes up.,57448,3
57448,"Very cute, though otherwise.",57448,3
57449,I ordered the white and the black.,57449,3
57449,The white is more of an ivory and doesn't work well if you need a white.,57449,3
57449,"Other than that they are a comfortable, soft fabric.",57449,3
57449,I recently had a double mastectomy and wanted some shape while I wait for my reconstruction surgery.,57449,3
57449,I ordered a med.,57449,3
57449,even though I am a 32 - 34 size and it doesn't fit as well as I like but it will do the job.,57449,3
57449,Definitely better than nothing.,57449,3
57450,I like this but the screws easily breaks into half,57450,3
57451,it's very tight fitting--i did keep it and it is nice quality.,57451,3
57452,Way too small despite the size label of 2-4t.,57452,3
57452,My 3 year old is small for her size and these socks didn't cover her entire foot.,57452,3
57452,Too bad because she otherwise loved them but I had to return them.,57452,3
57453,sizes are way off,57453,3
57454,"Undistinguished, regular quality and presentation, but it's a cute design.",57454,3
57456,"Not what I expected, but OK.",57456,3
57457,Shirt fits perfectly pants are to wide in waist,57457,3
57458,Wasn't quite the quality I had hoped for.,57458,3
57458,"Will be a gift for First Communion; hoping it does not break or ""fall apart"" for her.",57458,3
57459,Shorter than thought it would be,57459,3
57460,my GF is 5 ft 8 in 160 lb and she could not squeeze into this,57460,3
57461,I like it ok.,57461,3
57461,"I couldn't wear it, it's too small",57461,3
57463,"Very small purse, hardly fitted my Nexus.",57463,3
57463,But that has been advertised.,57463,3
57464,"Like other reviews have mentioned, the zipper doesn't close the whole bag, so if you drop the bag or knock it over, things will spill out.",57464,3
57464,"The middle compartment has a zippered part with no zipper, though, so I guess I won't be using that!!",57464,3
57464,"Overall, it's  a great bag for fitting things like a tablet, planner, books, etc, so I would say the size is its best feature.",57464,3
57464,I also like the over-the-shoulder attachment that comes with it.,57464,3
57465,I doa like the top part of the Dress it didn't fit properly,57465,3
57466,Cute shoes but they tend to run big.,57466,3
57466,Go a half size smaller.,57466,3
57466,No support in the back because they are too big so my foot slides forward.,57466,3
57466,Otherwise this is a stylish shoe to wear with jeans or a nice dress.,57466,3
57467,It looks way better in the picture it is much larger and bulky in real life... it doesn't fit like the picture either the rode is really long and hits the back of my neck...,57467,3
57468,just a little to big,57468,3
57469,Bought these for my daughter.,57469,3
57469,She is 5 ft 5..115.,57469,3
57469,I ordered a medium and they were not as baggy as the pic.,57469,3
57469,I thought because of her weight the medium would fit bigger.,57469,3
57469,Cute..my suggestion is if you want them baggy order the largest size because the medium got her like a small.,57469,3
57470,Nice but chain was too long and it was smaller than I expected.,57470,3
57471,The body of this costume fits well.,57471,3
57471,I had to take it to have the straps altered.,57471,3
57471,"I bought a Size Lg I am 5'3"", 150lbs and the straps were very long.",57471,3
57471,There was a hole in side of the costume as well.,57471,3
57471,The tights are very tight on the thigh.,57471,3
57472,The leather started peeling off after just a handful of uses.,57472,3
57472,"My husband wears this on the second notch, so it's not as if the best is too tight and being pulled too much.",57472,3
57472,Good price but not the best quality,57472,3
57473,"Though the bag is just as cute in person, the material is very flimsy and the ears don't hold their shape.",57473,3
57473,"Also the chain is only long enough to hang on your side, at least for me, hanging it across was too short and felt very silly.",57473,3
57473,"Cute bag, cheap fabric.",57473,3
57474,"Seam ripped almost immediately, even though i got a size up to make it more flowy and casual.",57474,3
57475,It is a super cute suit.,57475,3
57475,Very well made but not for big chested girls.,57475,3
57475,I will have to return it,57475,3
57477,The jewels are not sewn on very well and there are holes in the tulle.,57477,3
57478,A little more golden than the photo ...,57478,3
57478,I didn't like it so much.,57478,3
57479,Itbos cute but does not have the fair  in person but I can still rock it,57479,3
57480,"Quality was excellent for rhe price but at 5ft 108, the medium didn't fit.",57480,3
57480,"I probably should've gotten a small but because it was a little too ""open"" for my mom-bod taste in the back, I won't be ordering thre small.",57480,3
57480,Great for a taller person though-amazed with the quality for the price!,57480,3
57480,I def don't think sizing up is necessary on this on.,57480,3
57481,Nice material but a little small.,57481,3
57482,I love the quality of the leggings.,57482,3
57482,Super excited to wear them!,57482,3
57482,Unfortunatly fit to big for me :/ Overral upset with Amazon for charging me shipping for making an exchange on sizing.,57482,3
57483,I had hoped for 3 colors of brown and 3 of black instead my readers were all black...,57483,3
57484,This wand looks a lot cheaper than the other characters' wands.,57484,3
57484,"Yes, they are all made out of resin, but this one is painted brown to match the coloue of the character's wand and it just looks really cheap.",57484,3
57484,Very overpriced compared to how other wands of the same cheap material look.,57484,3
57485,"It states knee length, but it goes to my ankles.",57485,3
57486,Does not sit on face or nose area well,57486,3
57487,I like it a lot but the small parts that the straps attach to broke so easily.,57487,3
57487,I just attached them to the zippers now.,57487,3
57489,The light worked great but the top light fell out right away and haven't been able to get it to stay in place since.,57489,3
57490,A lot bigger than I expected not the size but the width of the ring and the stone is a lot bigger than I expected,57490,3
57491,Material and style was great.,57491,3
57491,However some parts of the skirt wasn't sown and the zipper kept on hitching until it opened up completely.,57491,3
57491,Luckily I hadn't left my home yet or it would have been a most embarrassing night:(.,57491,3
57491,Baring those two issues I still like the outfit.,57491,3
57492,Sheer chiffon material with fringe...,57492,3
57492,It is very pretty just wish it wasn't so boxy.,57492,3
57492,A bit more fitted would make this swimsuit cover very appealing and sexy.,57492,3
57492,I am 5' and 110 pounds.,57492,3
57493,TO MUCH MATIRIAL ON TOP,57493,3
57494,I ordered a large and I should have ordered an extra large .,57494,3
57494,They run quite small.,57494,3
57494,Im only 179 lbs and 5'10 and it was too small.,57494,3
57494,Also didn't realize how large the collar is !,57494,3
57494,The material is very thin as well.,57494,3
57494,This reminds me why I prefer to buy clothes in the store instead of online.,57494,3
57495,The sack is too small for my junk.,57495,3
57495,"They look good and fit right, but the pouch is not even close to big enough.",57495,3
57495,I cut the pouch out of mine.,57495,3
57496,"The bar is very short which makes the heart stick out rather than lay flat, but its still very cute",57496,3
57497,"For the price, this bag definitely looks more expensive than it is.",57497,3
57497,"I like the simple, classic look of it, but I did not like how it felt when I put it on.",57497,3
57497,"The material is very stiff, almost felt like putting on a cardboard box.",57497,3
57497,"Also, the straps are thinner than I would like, making it uncomfortable on my shoulders.",57497,3
57497,I also don't like how long the handle on top of the bag is.,57497,3
57497,"I'm assuming it was made that long in order to double as a handbag, but that was also an awkward look with the 2 straps hanging off the sides.",57497,3
57497,"Not bad for the price, and definitely looks like the picture, but I will be returning because I did not like the feel of the bag.",57497,3
57498,"I didn't take into consideration the ironing this is going to take....Its pretty though, but looks awful when not ironed.",57498,3
57499,The bra is fine but the underwear are ridiculously small.,57499,3
57499,The fabric is nice and soft.,57499,3
57500,"product was not what i expected, different  from the picture viewed",57500,3
57501,Pretty necklace but one of the links was broken when arrived :(,57501,3
57502,Should have ordered an xl as I am pretty tall (5'9).,57502,3
57503,Way too small across the bust.,57503,3
57503,Nice quality and I'm sorry it didn't fit and I had to return it.,57503,3
57504,Loved the shirt online but was disappointed in the quality of the material.,57504,3
57504,Fits a little snug.,57504,3
57505,Love them but alittle snug fitting.,57505,3
57507,Love this turtleneck but should have ordered a large because it runs small.,57507,3
57507,Like stand up collar.,57507,3
57508,"When I first opened the package, I was excited.",57508,3
57508,Wow.. At first glance it looked too large... Then when I tried to put it on...,57508,3
57508,I began laughing so hard.,57508,3
57508,"The opening where you are to slip it over your head, didn't even fit over my head.",57508,3
57508,"I purchased a Large..., I normally where a medium to large.",57508,3
57508,"It was so small that I gave it to my sister, whom weights about 95 pounds, size 4.",57508,3
57508,She was barely able to slip it on.,57508,3
57508,"We both loved this dress, but really, really RUNS TINY SMALL.",57508,3
57508,"If you are very slender, then this might work for you.",57508,3
57508,If you are of average curvy size.. don't bother.,57508,3
57509,"Very cute but I'm 5'8 and the small was too short, maybe I should've gotten a size up.",57509,3
57509,Becareful when selecting size.,57509,3
57510,Ok  for the price,57510,3
57511,this is an off the shoulder dress.,57511,3
57511,the model shows otherwise.,57511,3
57511,I'll still wear it and it's great for the price.,57511,3
57511,but I wanted a regular dress not off the shoulder.,57511,3
57512,I am not reviewing the shoes,57512,3
57513,Watch out buying this item.,57513,3
57513,I thought since I am only 5'0 that it would be long enough but the slip part doesn't even cover my butt.,57513,3
57513,It fits like a breezy top.,57513,3
57513,So if you are looking for a dress star clear of this product.,57513,3
57514,It's a little bit baggy in the front it's not so stretchy material like I thought but I can wear it not bad for the price.,57514,3
57515,Not as slouchy as I would have liked but still cute!,57515,3
57516,just as i waiting for,57516,3
57517,"Same as a few other reviewers, I should have looked a little closer to the description.",57517,3
57517,These seem like the kimono style onsies that I was looking for (and typed into the search engine).,57517,3
57517,They are deceiving and only have a larger neck hole...they still have to go over the babes head :(,57517,3
57518,"I ordered this suit, because it is super cite and different than your typical triangle top string bikinobthat every one wear nowadays.",57518,3
57518,When I ordered this I chose a small based on the reviews.,57518,3
57518,"I am 120lbs 4'11"", a 34c in the the bust, and have a butt.",57518,3
57518,The top fit perfectly as it wasn't too tight or too loose.,57518,3
57518,But the bottoms you can forget it.,57518,3
57518,It wouldn't even fit a 5 year old.,57518,3
57518,I still plan to wear the top and just find a black bottom that I can fit into else wear.,57518,3
57519,I got this top and another in a different color to go under another top.,57519,3
57519,I love the detail in the back but the arm area and the space in the back between the straps is slightly droopy.,57519,3
57519,"The good news for me is that I made it work with the top I wanted it under and it looks great, the back of my other top covered up the drooping.",57519,3
57519,But as for wearing these by themselves it is a no go.,57519,3
57519,I like the details but the drooping just ruins it.,57519,3
57519,I also could have ordered a size lower.,57519,3
57519,"So for those of you looking at this, either order your regular size or a size down and the back should look way better.",57519,3
57520,I gave this 3 stars because of sizing.,57520,3
57520,I ordered 6-9 months and it's the size of 2t clothing.,57520,3
57522,"The hat is adorable and I cannot wait to see my grandson in it on the beach, but it is very large for him.",57522,3
57522,I am keeping it because the trip is coming up rather quickly and I think that it is more important to have the sun protection than the fit of the hat.,57522,3
57523,"It was really white, and then the ivory was still too white.",57523,3
57524,"Ugh.. Its made ok, but the lace was not laced up and is very hard to lace it up since the material is so soft..",57524,3
57526,came with one of the seams ripped or not sown.,57526,3
57526,The company was not easy to work with.,57526,3
57526,Will not purchase again.,57526,3
57527,Very old lady looking in person and too small.,57527,3
57528,Super cute but has a misspelling.,57528,3
57529,I am very petite and bought a medium - it is small on me!,57529,3
57529,Really surprised - should have bought a large and I wear size 6.,57529,3
57530,Love the hat but it's way to small.,57530,3
57531,"This shirt is nice enough, but you will want to order it several sizes bigger that you normally would.",57531,3
57531,I ordered it 3 sizes bigger that I would order a higher quality shirt and it is still a little bit too small...if you like it to actually button over your chest that is...and I do.,57531,3
57531,It fits everywhere else just fine.,57531,3
57531,And I'm only an average size (B/C cup) chest.,57531,3
57531,I know it's from China and everything runs really small there but even by their size charts this shirt is small in the chest area.,57531,3
57532,Buy next size up!,57532,3
57533,"I love the rose charm, but one of the chains broke within the first week and a half of wearing it.",57533,3
57534,Bought this Brand before and fit as specified; this time around they are smaller than the Large usually fits.,57534,3
57535,"It's a bit too small, and sadly the silver squares were falling off.",57535,3
57535,I had to take some fabric glue and fix them.,57535,3
57535,This definitely is a hand wash item only.,57535,3
57536,Very warm I absolutely loved them until a hole formed in the Seam of the pants only have had them a month and a half,57536,3
57538,I like the graphics but didn't fit so my wife wears it instead,57538,3
57540,The vendor did a good job.,57540,3
57540,The quality and price is fine.,57540,3
57540,It's not a great cut for a tee.,57540,3
57540,"The neck is a little high, and the shoulders are constricted.",57540,3
57541,Much more pink when it arrived.,57541,3
57544,Bought it for my pregnant daughter.,57544,3
57544,No way would it fit a preg woman no matter how small she is.,57544,3
57544,It fits me and I like it.,57544,3
57544,I bought a XL and normally wear a med.,57544,3
57545,I like it but I won't be wearing it out anywhere as it pulls too tight in the crotch.,57545,3
57545,I used the size chart when placing my order.,57545,3
57546,I ordered a large and the top was like a small or extra small I could barely button it,57546,3
57547,"I think it works, but it is pretty uncomfortable to wear.",57547,3
57547,"Plus, you'll need a smaller size in a few days so I wish I would've sized to my original waist.",57547,3
57548,The fit was too small i would need to order one size bigger.,57548,3
57548,Material is thin and shimmery not what i expected kind of cheap looking.,57548,3
57548,Overall if it were a better fit i would keep it only cause it wasn't through prime.... i will stick to my lindy bop dresses.,57548,3
57549,I wish they printed this on a better sized shirt.,57549,3
57549,"other than that, shirt was OK!",57549,3
57550,Not padded as much as I'd hoped but they do work okay.,57550,3
57551,I'd buy a size bigger than they recommend,57551,3
57552,did not like fabric too much,57552,3
57553,The small size was too small and the leather closure by the neck looks and feels fake.,57553,3
57553,I'm giving this jacket 3 starts because I liked the style and that it was just as light as I expected for a spring jacket.,57553,3
57553,But I would recommend the one without the leather closure by the neck.,57553,3
57555,NICE; BUT WWWAAAYYY TO SMALL,57555,3
57556,too big but cute,57556,3
57557,the belt is little bet wide and soft,57557,3
57558,i would like it more if the top fit better.,57558,3
57558,the panties are cute and fit fine,57558,3
57560,For the price you really can't beat this jacket.,57560,3
57560,I'm sure the patches alone were worth the cost of the coat.,57560,3
57560,It's very lightweight and the fit is pretty much as expected.,57560,3
57560,The only complaint on this jacket is the smell!,57560,3
57560,"I would have gave it 5 stars but the smell of formaldehyde is so strong that I had to purchase an odor eater kit - haven't received it yet, but I sure hope it will take that funky smell out.",57560,3
57561,Nice shirt but it's very loose around the mid section (Like it's not form fitting.,57561,3
57561,Very open not tight).,57561,3
57562,I didn't return it.,57562,3
57562,Style I like but not the color.,57562,3
57563,"Cute socks, but way too big.",57563,3
57563,I wear a 9 1/2 women's shoe and they were still too big.,57563,3
57563,Stayed under my foot most of the day.,57563,3
57564,"Good jacket, but waaaaaaay too small",57564,3
57565,It was a little big,57565,3
57566,Hearts are bigger than expected and don't lay flat which sometimes feels awkward.,57566,3
57566,I'm not one to remove anklets every day so hoping it doesn't tarnish,57566,3
57567,I purchased this item for my vacation this year.,57567,3
57567,It appears to run a little big,57567,3
57569,The ID holder is a little snug.,57569,3
57569,A cut out in the plastic to easily slide an ID out would have made this a 5/5.,57569,3
57570,You got what you paid for,57570,3
57571,"styling is pretty cool, but nylon mesh kinda' hurts my penis.",57571,3
57572,I got the 6-12 month size for my 7 month old.,57572,3
57572,The snaps are too tight around the legs.,57572,3
57572,"It's cotton, so I'm not sure what the other people received.",57572,3
57572,The neck opening is a bit too large.,57572,3
57573,"I ordered two pairs of xs ...one in red , the other one ne in blue .",57573,3
57573,Both pairs were labeled xs .,57573,3
57573,"However, the red pair was at least two sizes bigger than the blue pair.",57573,3
57573,"After reading some of the reviews , I have concluded that there seems to be a ""sizable"" problem with Your sizing system .",57573,3
57573,The material is great...very sturdy...great vibrant colours !,57573,3
57574,The earrings are nice but the color is hideous.,57574,3
57574,It's like a blend of yellow and gold.,57574,3
57574,"I wish they looked a bit less ""blingy.""",57574,3
57575,Smaller than I would have liked and the detail not as nice as in the photo,57575,3
57576,Wasn't long enough to go through my lip.,57576,3
57576,I ended up having to take the piercing out anyway for work because I didn't have time to buy a different set.,57576,3
57577,Good for short term wear but a little sharp for regular wear.,57577,3
57578,Quality is fine but sizing runs way small.,57578,3
57578,I wear a size 10.5 and can tolerate these.,57578,3
57578,Would prefer a 13.,57578,3
57579,This dress is the wife's  I think she is ok with it,57579,3
57580,Very comfy runs small and fabric not as nice as expected.,57580,3
57581,It's good  but those sleeves it's to small,57581,3
57582,The lobster clasp broke the second time I put it on.,57582,3
57582,It was easy to buy another clasp and reattach but disappointing that I had to do that right away.,57582,3
57583,Not quite sure why I got this,57583,3
57585,"My daughter has managed to take these off too...she's 15 months old, how is she doing it?",57585,3
57586,The neckline is so large that my bra straps show.,57586,3
57586,Otherwise it's a good fit and well-made.,57586,3
57587,very very thin material-if I could get it on it might work!,57587,3
57588,def  won't put into dryer,57588,3
57589,For me this is one piece to wear when going out.,57589,3
57589,It does easily gey snagged on by my hair and when sleeping snags on the pillows.,57589,3
57590,I order a medium but fits like a small,57590,3
57591,but have a litter big break but still okay,57591,3
57592,L:ike the color just wish had more of a butt lifting effect.,57592,3
57592,My hopes may have been too high,57592,3
57593,The shipping time was really lengthy.,57593,3
57593,The dress is shorter than what appears on the model and much wider than what appears on the model.,57593,3
57593,The dress I got I could wear to church its not the sexy version the model is wearing.,57593,3
57593,"I am 5'3"" and 100lbs.",57593,3
57594,I didn't find them comfortable.,57594,3
57594,"1.the elastic inside the waist band flips, twists......annoying.",57594,3
57594,"A bit snug for a large, i wanted them lose.",57594,3
57595,This ring looks cheap.,57595,3
57596,Not a bad material.,57596,3
57596,Fits fine at the top but very close fitting at at the bottom.,57596,3
57597,I ordered the mask because of color - it is cool.,57597,3
57597,"The main downside is that it's not fleecy on the inside, so I get cold at higher speeds.",57597,3
57597,"Another minus is that the color changes because of breath condensate, so there is a small spot of water in the nose/mouth area which does not look flattery.",57597,3
57597,Seirus Innovation 6810 remains the main mask I wear now.,57597,3
57597,I wish it were in other complex graphic color.,57597,3
57598,First of all I ordered the Light Blue jumpsuit.,57598,3
57598,What I received was a Mint colored jumpsuit!!,57598,3
57598,But this is a very cute  and casually sexy outfit.,57598,3
57598,"I'm curvy 5'4"" & a true 16/18 and I ordered up a size 18/20 and it was still a bit snug for my liking, in the hips and thighs..But with a body slimmer and hemming about 3 -4inch it's too cute to return as I am currently losing weight..so it's a keeper, even though I received the Wrong color!",57598,3
57599,Seriously...if you normally wear a small...you will need a Large.,57599,3
57599,Cute but too small.,57599,3
57600,Cute shirt.smaller than expected.,57600,3
57600,Good buy for the price,57600,3
57601,"I admit, I'm a major Star Wars fan, have been from the beginning.",57601,3
57601,Am thrilled that I now have a full bracelet of Star Wars charms and was ecstatic about this charm.,57601,3
57601,I've now had to buy it twice and it's already on it's last wing.,57601,3
57601,":( It catches, bends, and breaks easily.",57601,3
57601,It is killing me that I had to take it off my Star Wars Bracelet.,57601,3
57601,"I don't wear my Star Wars Bracelet to bed, to shower, or as daily piece, mostly because I want it to last.",57601,3
57601,"But this charm is making it really sad, because I wanted the tie fighter on my wrist.",57601,3
57602,Cute but the sleeves are too tight so it's hard to wear.,57602,3
57602,It cuts off my circulation.,57602,3
57602,I don't have thick forearms lol.,57602,3
57603,Not sure why they were advertised as navy.,57603,3
57603,They were not navy at all.,57603,3
57604,Very cute but too small,57604,3
57605,This skirt was smaller than I expected.,57605,3
57606,"light weight fabric, well constructed.",57606,3
57606,adopting this color as my new favorite,57606,3
57607,"This outfit is very cute, however it is not made very well.",57607,3
57607,The top has a weird cut and gives me major side boob (I ordered a medium).,57607,3
57607,The elastic on the bottoms is also made very strangely.,57607,3
57607,I don't have a large waist and yet it still feel that it's cutting my circulation.,57607,3
57607,"I currently have it stretching out, hoefully that will help it.",57607,3
57607,The material is very cheap and extremely see through.,57607,3
57607,I decided not to return it as I bought it for a trip but I don't think I would wear it again after that.,57607,3
57608,"This top is really cute, but I ordered the same size as all my other PattyBoutik tops and this one was too tight.",57608,3
57608,The fabric has no stretch to it.,57608,3
57608,It is however a well made and cute top.,57608,3
57608,Just ere on the larger size if you are not sure which to pick.,57608,3
57609,I'm a 1X so I ordered the XXL to have some room to move.,57609,3
57609,"I can get it on, but it's a little snug.",57609,3
57609,"The color and detail pattern are both very nice, so I decided to pass it along to a family member rather than return it.",57609,3
57610,it's okay but little small.,57610,3
57611,Suuuuper adorable but an 11 fit like an 8 or 9.,57611,3
57612,I bought this blazer for a trip but I ended up wearing it sooner than I thought I couldn't resist.,57612,3
57612,I had my eye on this jazzy blazer for a very long time and finally had the chance to get it however its a bit small I'm a US medium I bought it in a XL and it is still to snug on me and kind of short in the length I did get some compliments on it but I was dressed up so maybe it was the dress shirt and tie that made it a bit tight so I'm going to try a more casual look the next time and see how it fits then also the fabric is pretty good also,57612,3
57613,"I love how this looks on me, but not comfortable.",57613,3
57613,The leg holes were too tight and the top cups were too big.,57613,3
57613,I'm a 34 D. I guess it would fit someone with slim thighs and big breast better.,57613,3
57613,Will have to return.,57613,3
57614,Dress was nice but runs small.,57614,3
57617,"Looks pretty cheap but for the price, can't complain too much.",57617,3
57617,"Fast shipping, thank you.",57617,3
57618,I'm a small adult.,57618,3
57618,Very tight on my arms.,57618,3
57619,On model lands above knees.,57619,3
57619,On me it lands at the knee with the sleeves hanging below my finger tips.,57619,3
57619,Small around waist on me and gaps at bottom of coat.,57619,3
57620,Looks pretty good and sturdy.,57620,3
57620,"I love the color, it is just as pictured.",57620,3
57620,"It does however, have a pretty distinct chemical smell.",57620,3
57621,I hate giving a poor review however these pants were very small on me and I ordered the size up.,57621,3
57621,"I wear 32 USA men's (I wear Levi's 559, 170 lbs, 5' 11"" - as a reference) and I ordered the 34.",57621,3
57621,I couldn't get them up all the way.,57621,3
57621,I literally double checked the label because I thought I had a smaller size.,57621,3
57621,Be very wary of the sizing chart.,57621,3
57621,"Also they seemed more straight leg than ""baggy"".",57621,3
57621,I gave them 3 stars because the materials and stitching seemed legit and the price was right.,57621,3
57621,"I did not order the size up, I returned them.",57621,3
57621,"I did not want to see a size 38....Once they correct their sizing I will be back, however in the meantime I will move on.",57621,3
57621,-written by Jessica's hubby,57621,3
57623,"cute but no comfort in these, and they run narrow",57623,3
57624,These fit pretty small.,57624,3
57624,I couldn't snap the buttons on the side even though I ordered a sz up.,57624,3
57626,Size was smaller than expected.,57626,3
57627,"This vest is beautiful and very well made, however it runs very large.",57627,3
57628,Strap is to short..,57628,3
57628,"It's okay to just hang on your shoulder, but not to cross your chest.",57628,3
57629,"Mediocre, but not bad for the price.",57629,3
57629,Material isn't the best of quality,57629,3
57630,The swim suit is really cute but about two sizes smaller than tagged.,57630,3
57631,Normally a size M so after reading the reviews I order a L. The top is a lit.small and the bottom are a lit.big but they don't really cover much of the butt (I guess u must have a flat butt).,57631,3
57631,Still I'm ok with it.,57631,3
57634,Tight in the arms,57634,3
57635,It's sheer so you have to buy another top to wear underneath.,57635,3
57635,It should come with the top underneath.,57635,3
57638,I bought these for my husband.,57638,3
57638,They work great but the size of the lens are huge.,57638,3
57639,The sizing with these pajama jeans can be inconsistent.,57639,3
57639,But comfortable and wash well.,57639,3
57640,"I think the gold is too much in the light, it looks awesome under dim light.",57640,3
57640,It is pretty short from the back.,57640,3
57640,I ordered a XL & unfortunately is snug on me.,57640,3
57642,It came very fast but its smaller than the size you pick.,57642,3
57642,I would go way up.,57642,3
57642,The material is great and it's adorable just runs very small,57642,3
57643,This is probably cut for juniors.,57643,3
57643,I ordered a large expecting it to be a little oversized.,57643,3
57643,"Instead, it's too tight in the hips, and too short.",57643,3
57643,I don't like the overly stretchy material either.,57643,3
57643,It seems to be good quality with nice seams and zipper...and the color is good though.,57643,3
57644,"I paid very little for this bracelet & ""you get what u pay for"".",57644,3
57644,"But it is cute if u like costume jewelry even if it's a bit ""fake"" looking",57644,3
57645,They are very tiny.,57645,3
57645,Wish they were larger.,57645,3
57646,I'm in between sizes because of weight loss.,57646,3
57646,Does this come one size larger?,57646,3
57646,I really like the support it gave my legs.,57646,3
57647,The bodice is extremely small.,57647,3
57647,Not made for someone with a bust bigger than a B cup,57647,3
57648,"1 size fits all was the only option, but it is a bit too small.",57648,3
57649,"Super, super thin material.",57649,3
57649,"All ""writing"" I.e., WASHING INSTRUCTIONS - are written in Chinese- including the indecipherable size on the inside neck of the top!",57649,3
57649,I guess the Leveret brand of P.J.s have really spoiled me!,57649,3
57650,Too small for anything besides your computer.,57650,3
57651,I would give it a better rating but I feel I lacks a zipper closure and its flimsy.,57651,3
57651,I don't blkame Amazon.,57651,3
57651,I think the manufacturer could do better.,57651,3
57652,"Even though this was wayyyyy too small for my breasts, this is still good quality and the design is great!!",57652,3
57652,I wear a 38DDD and sometimes a G so I knew it was a risk.,57652,3
57652,But there's not enough cup of support in the top.,57652,3
57652,I'd be flashing people left and right.,57652,3
57653,I bought this for my mom and she's Size Large.,57653,3
57653,But the blouse fit me that I am X-small,57653,3
57655,"It fits good, just a little tight.",57655,3
57656,It looks so much better in the picture than it does in person.,57656,3
57657,"While they certainly are soft and comfortable, after only one wash I was getting a lot of ""pilling"" on the waist band.",57657,3
57657,"Given the high cost, I had hoped that they would be more durable.",57657,3
57657,I'll update comments and stars after a few months.,57657,3
57658,Seems large for what's supposed to be 0-6 months.,57658,3
57658,But it does seem like it blocks sun from the face.,57658,3
57659,"It is ok, rather small.",57659,3
57659,"For a secret pal gift ,it is ok. price was good,so wasn't expecting an expensive piece of jewlery.",57659,3
57660,Product ran small and the green is not as vibrant.,57660,3
57660,3* because the seller was awesome with fixing my problem !,57660,3
57660,If you have a flat butt it will fit,57660,3
57661,they look rather cheep..the chain that connects it..looks cheesy..I will say for tweens this would be good..but not for adults if your looking for style..these are not it...there not made with leather..just cheep plastic.,57661,3
57662,"Fit perfectly on me, just didn't really like the shape it gave my boobs.",57662,3
57662,It sticks on pretty well and hasn't lost it's stick yet.,57662,3
57662,I used it about 10 times so far.,57662,3
57662,"I just wouldn't wear it with something tight, gives your boobs a weird shape.",57662,3
57663,It didn't fit my (somewhat large) head.,57663,3
57664,"The elbows are not sewn on well
And first one ordered was suede and loved and second one was plastic leather type :(",57664,3
57665,Breast part is too small,57665,3
57666,I ordered it and it fit nice and tight but the turtle neck did not feel right to me so I returned it with the hopes of exchanging it for a lower neck line.,57666,3
57666,It has been a real process to get the return moving forward.,57666,3
57666,So the 2nd time I ordered a larger size and I am pleased.,57666,3
57666,It is as pictured.,57666,3
57667,The elastic snapped the first time I tried to put it on.,57667,3
57667,Luckily I found all the stones.,57667,3
57667,I will have them restrung with a clasp.,57667,3
57668,"Although this is my son's size, the shirt hangs down to his thighs.",57668,3
57668,It's almost as if it is designed as a Tall Size.,57668,3
57669,Came quicker than expected.,57669,3
57669,Very cute and I love this necklace.,57669,3
57669,"The only thing I have to say about it is cheap metal of course, but in the sun it gets really hot and sometimes burns my skin (not severely but irritating enough.)",57669,3
57669,I would still recommend this product:),57669,3
57670,"They where what I seen in the pic but the sizing was really off , was going to send them back but I guess I'll wait till she can fit them",57670,3
57671,I love the feel and pattern of the fabric but this dress isn't cut well enough to fit a pregnant body (I'm at 6 months).,57671,3
57671,It falls too short in the front and pulls in the back trying to make room for the belly and it is also cut very small on top- I would think for an A or B cup.,57671,3
57671,I like the dress so much - as it should fit- that I may risk trying to order a size up but I don't know if that will do it....,57671,3
57671,This dress should be made with more room for the belly and a bigger bust in my opinion.,57671,3
57671,"(I am 5'6"" 152 lbs and ordered a medium originally, which is my usual maternity size).",57671,3
57672,They fit like 9m pajamas,57672,3
57673,Haven't worn this yet but I did try it on.,57673,3
57673,"The back isn't as open as it should be, that was a bummer and the material is itchy.",57673,3
57673,It is cute tho.,57673,3
57675,"Pull it from the dryer right away and hang it up, or get out the iron & board.",57675,3
57675,Doesn't look very good with wrinkles.,57675,3
57676,It's comfortable but basically it's a shirt.,57676,3
57676,"Material wise it's almost the same as a cotton shirt so if your just lounging around it's not bad but if your swimming where waves could ""pull"" anything I wouldn't recommend the suit",57676,3
57677,It's huge up top and tight at the bottom.,57677,3
57677,It did shrink up to above my knees when washed and dried.,57677,3
57677,Soft and comfy though.,57677,3
57678,"Windows with frequent use, tear too easily when you cards are being pulled out and in frequently; i.e.",57678,3
57678,"That being said, I do like the design and will purchase again.",57678,3
57679,Very cute but it bled quite a lot when I washed it in cold water.,57679,3
57679,"The color is pretty and it's cute and swingy and short as pictured (I'm 5'5"" - definitely a mini).",57679,3
57679,Just wash it by itself the first time.,57679,3
57679,I washed it in cold water with some other colored clothes and the dye showed up on the other things.,57679,3
57680,Gets the job done but it's nothing compared to a nice 30-50 dollar belt that I was replacing but could no longer find in stores.,57680,3
57680,It's lighter gauge leather and metal.,57680,3
57680,Spend the money and get a better belt.,57680,3
57682,Super cute but very low rise.,57682,3
57682,Not even close to 4x more like a 1-2x.,57682,3
57682,Keeping them for next year,57682,3
57683,"Just as pretty as pictured, but you can only keep a very few things in the wallet part or the case won't close.",57683,3
57684,Very pretty buy two sizes to small.,57684,3
57685,"Lovely material and design, but very small.",57685,3
57685,I'm a size sm to med..,57685,3
57685,I ordered a large.. and it is way to small!,57685,3
57685,However if you like super tight tops.. you might love this one.,57685,3
57686,Very cute outfit but the pants are way to small and the suspenders are way to big.,57686,3
57686,Shirt was a great fit though.,57686,3
57687,I like the thicker elastic straps and adjustable friction locks.,57687,3
57687,Unfortunately the first strap / metal clasp I attached to my uniform shirt  came completely apart when locking the clasp down.,57687,3
57687,"After several attempts of putting it back together and having only to come apart, I used needle nose pliers to slightly bend the hing  portion inward to prevent the clasp from rolling out of the highpoint  / eyelets.",57687,3
57687,I did this to all 8 metal clasps.,57687,3
57687,"After a week of use and clasp adjustment, they seem to be staying in place as needed.",57687,3
57689,I really loved the look of these sandals but for some reason my feet slipped around in them.,57689,3
57689,I would've preferred a flat black but the only black was the shiny look.,57689,3
57692,Distressed look nothing like the picture 10 Portland me material I would not recommend the stress at all,57692,3
57693,The size chart is a little off on the listing.,57693,3
57693,"I normally wear a small and this was painted on, except for the boob area.",57693,3
57693,It has extra fabric there for rouching effect but it doesn't lay quite right.,57693,3
57693,I will try ordering something else.,57693,3
57694,"The polarization wasn't that great, and they didn't last more than a couple months (plastic part of frame broke at one of the bridge screws), but at this price point none of this was unexpected.",57694,3
57695,bought this for my wife.,57695,3
57695,She was a little disappointed that it was more a spandex than anything else so there wasn't as much of a draping effect.,57695,3
57696,It's a little awkward looking because it's so loose and it's a little short.,57696,3
57696,"Comes just above the belly button for me and I'm 5' 5"" but I also have small breasts.",57696,3
57696,It's really comfortable though.,57696,3
57697,"Beautiful dress, Love the way it looks!",57697,3
57697,Fast shipping but very roomy in the whole dress and I went by the size chart.,57697,3
57697,I returned it and ordered a 10 I'm hoping that it isn't to small for me now.,57697,3
57698,Shrunk like crazy after drying once.,57698,3
57699,"Sizing is strange, seems short and wide of.",57699,3
57699,"Of course I am not pregnant, but I am nursing newborn twins (3 month olds), so I need practical clothing that I nurse two at a time in easily.",57699,3
57699,"The design seems to do the trick, but the zipper is a cheap zipper unfortunately.",57699,3
57699,"It isn't the warmest of hoodies, but should be fine for fall and early winter in the northeast.",57699,3
57699,"A little high on the price for the overall quality, I don't think I would buy another one at this price, maybe if it were priced $25-27...",57699,3
57700,"very tight and im not crazy about the material, the shirt comes up all the way to my neck and is actually very uncomfortable on my neck.",57700,3
57700,The print and fit otherwise is as shown in photo.,57700,3
57701,"I really love this swimsuit, the reason for the 3 stars and not 5, is first the sizing is WAY off.....I'm normally a size 12, so I ordered a large.....only to have to return it, and order a 2x.",57701,3
57701,"And that was even a bit tight, although it was fine......2nd, the first time that I wore it, I didn't wash it before going to the beach.....I don't know what happened but when getting wet.",57701,3
57701,"The blue color bled, only it the back of the bathing suit....I had blue dye on my skin when I took it off.....I still got a lot of compliments on it, but now I can't wear it, because of all the dye.....I would like to get another one, but afraid it will do it again......the instructions did not mention to wash b4 use.",57701,3
57704,Leather was a bit thinner than I had expected.,57704,3
57704,Nice for the money though.,57704,3
57705,The size and it's costing much more than the dress cost to return it.,57705,3
57706,Kind of thin for winter.,57706,3
57707,"These undies were good, but a little small.",57707,3
57707,Not much room for the package.,57707,3
57707,They also ride up a little to high on the lef which makes it so that jeans or tough pants can chafe the inner Thighs.,57707,3
57708,nice scarf shipping just takes forver,57708,3
57709,"Very thin material, and one side of the dresses seam was not stitched along the seam, so there was a noticeable gap on the side of the dress.",57709,3
57709,It almost looks as if it is coming apart.,57709,3
57709,"I will have a seamstress fix it, but the quality of the dress was very poor.",57709,3
57711,"Pretty, but the cups were waaaaaay too small",57711,3
57712,I loved the coat but there was No Way it was going to fit me!!!,57712,3
57712,It took a month to get here since it came directly from China.,57712,3
57712,If I had known that I would have ordered something else.,57712,3
57712,I ordered an XL and the way it fit I should have ordered an XXL or higher.,57712,3
57712,They seem to be made for the small Chinese women.,57712,3
57714,I like the suit but omg its so small!,57714,3
57714,I couldn't get it over my hips!,57714,3
57714,I'm 5'4 and 135lbs and ordered a large.,57714,3
57714,It fits like an extra small.,57714,3
57714,I need like a XXL in this thing!,57714,3
57715,"I asked for a pink and received red, which end up okay as it was a gift.",57715,3
57715,It did come quickly.,57715,3
57716,I'm glad I read the reviews before I bought this shirt.,57716,3
57716,The reviews said the shirt runs several sizes small.,57716,3
57716,I normally wear a size small but ordered this shirt in a large...and it fits just like it is shown on the model in the picture (just slightly loose).,57716,3
57716,"The shirt is like a knit, shear, light-weight sweater t-shirt.",57716,3
57717,"XL is too small for anyone above 5, 6. if you are tall this is not for you.",57717,3
57717,if you have bigger than a C cup this is not for you either .,57717,3
57719,Fast shipping was a plus.,57719,3
57719,Item is made to fit any size head bc it has elastic inside but it is just made way too large.,57719,3
57719,My husband looks like a clown wearing a giant hat.,57719,3
57719,It also didn't look quite like I had expected.,57719,3
57719,It's made of felt.,57719,3
57719,I got what I paid for...,57719,3
57720,Looks better in the picture,57720,3
57721,I bought 2 of these and mixed 2 sizes together.,57721,3
57721,I am using the small size for the top.,57721,3
57721,I am a 34C.,57721,3
57721,But the small bottoms were teensy tiney.,57721,3
57721,So I am wearing a medium in those.,57721,3
57721,I am not pear shaped or particularly curvy so I don't think I'd be wrong to advise others to expect the same issue with the sizing.,57721,3
57722,"I ordered 2 sizes larger for my son due to the slim fit, it fit him perfect, please make sure you order a larger size.",57722,3
57722,"My son is slim but the suite should be ordered a little larger, the jacket fit perfect.",57722,3
57722,"Nice suite for younger person very slim fitting looks good with nice belt, very flat front on pants, looked nice on teenager.",57722,3
57722,"Pants did not have a hem, will need to be hemmed.",57722,3
57722,The fabric is not really shinny but will do the job.,57722,3
57723,"For the price I paid, these fit great and are very comfortable.",57723,3
57723,I wore them for the first time at Yoga.,57723,3
57723,"While down I my mat, I noticed there was a hole in the leg seam of the pants.",57723,3
57723,Just tried to contact the seller and received an error message.,57723,3
57723,Not spending money to send them back.,57723,3
57724,It's very cute but also very big.,57724,3
57724,I don't think I'll ever wear it...,57724,3
57724,It touches my upper lip when I talk.,57724,3
57725,I'm 5'6 and it's short on me.,57725,3
57725,About 3 inches from the ground,57725,3
57726,"True to size, but disappointed with the color.",57726,3
57726,It is more if a mauve than pink.,57726,3
57728,"Nice material, I will just have to lose a few pounds, but like it and will keep it.",57728,3
57729,"Very pretty, but way too small.",57729,3
57731,Is not what I expected but at least you can modify it a little bit and it goes from a weird dress to a really nice one,57731,3
57732,it gets worn out after a while,57732,3
57733,The wig was very cute and curly but was VERY SMALL.,57733,3
57733,"Wigs are usually a tad bit tighter on my head but this one was outrageously tight, I had to cut slits in it to expand it a little.",57733,3
57733,The bangs were long enough to go past my chin but cut easily.,57733,3
57733,"I applied head via hair dryer and round brush to ""fluff"" the bangs and part of them melted off.",57733,3
57733,It gives a good look and is decent for the price.,57733,3
57735,A bit tight so gave it to someone smaller.,57735,3
57735,The one size fits all is not accurate as I normally wear a size 8.,57735,3
57736,My niece wears a 5 or 6 in pants so we ordered a six and as you can tell In the first picture it swallowed her .,57736,3
57736,The sizing chart posted is no where close to accurate.,57736,3
57736,Attempted to return and seller does not pay return shipping cost and does not issue a refund until package arrives back in China which takes several weeks .,57736,3
57736,I had to come out of pocket for the second dress which is a  4 and it fit perfectly with no alterations .,57736,3
57736,The dress is beautiful and full if you add a petticoat underneath like we did .,57736,3
57736,Giving three stars because the sizing chart is so off and returning items is a mess .,57736,3
57738,The outfit is SUPER cute.,57738,3
57738,"But I ordered my 15 month old this who's 24 pounds and it wasn't gonna fit her any time soon, and I ordered size 1-2.",57738,3
57739,Chain is really a little short to pull over your head.,57739,3
57739,Not only that but the chain broke the second week I had it.,57739,3
57739,I still wear the dog tag but use a different necklace I had from something else.,57739,3
57740,I said it fit as expected because I knew that it is a one size and fits up to 37'' chest.,57740,3
57740,"I do not have the flattest stomach after having two children so unless I wear something to hide it, my 'curves' show.",57740,3
57740,I wear a 36 d to dd (depending on the bra) and I don't think it will fit any larger.,57740,3
57740,and the front doesnt dip down as it should because of my bust.,57740,3
57740,and the material is polyester feeling but not a super tight weave or else it would probably be tighter and I wouldn't be able to wear it.,57740,3
57740,three stars because the shoulder strap should remain on the shoulder and the sleeves could be attached lower as to help the straps be used as they should,57740,3
57741,Light weight but ran small so I returned it.,57741,3
57741,I had gotten the largest size so I had to do without,57741,3
57742,A bit revealing n a bit big but beautiful,57742,3
57743,"Good for a one-time wear, but poorly made.",57743,3
57743,"Fit across the chest, but loose in one armpit and crotch...",57743,3
57744,I recommend ordering a size smaller.,57744,3
57744,I'm about 5'5 and 115 pounds but the medium was too big.,57744,3
57744,The dress is also a bit see through so you should buy a slip to go underneath.,57744,3
57744,However this company has great service.,57744,3
57745,Waist is not as high as shown.,57745,3
57746,Not that high quality,57746,3
57747,Order a size or two up.,57747,3
57749,I really wanted a big blue purse and I thought this was it; I wasn't sold on the price but I thought it was well made so I purchased it.,57749,3
57749,The 1st day one of the lil things on the bottom of the purse fell off.,57749,3
57749,I think it's cute but not worth the price.,57749,3
57750,I had to go over all the buttons with more thread.,57750,3
57750,Looks like it was barely finished.,57750,3
57750,Cheap fabric as well.,57750,3
57750,Definitely wouldn't recommend this jacket for very cold winters.,57750,3
57750,More of a fall jacket.,57750,3
57750,If you do want this jacket make sure you order 2 sizes larger than you would normally,57750,3
57751,For the price it's ok. Will serve its purpose.,57751,3
57752,"Very cute but runs small, not a baggy tee like I was expecting.",57752,3
57753,Smaller than the photos,57753,3
57754,"This cap would have gotten 5 stars EXCEPT that it features a scratchy tacky label, front and center.",57754,3
57754,"The label pulls at my loose hairs, and the placement is dreadful.",57754,3
57754,"After two days, I've finally taken to it gently with a seam ripper.",57754,3
57754,"This tag is not coming off easily and I've now created two
small holes in my brand new cap.",57754,3
57754,"I know advertisement is invaluable for new businesses, but this label is so obnoxious, that I am much less likely to help promote this well-made, useful satin-lined cap one bit.",57754,3
57754,"The prominent label placement backfired for these guys- seems a shame
I would likely buy several more, if this one issue were resolved.",57754,3
57755,Lovely but to noisy,57755,3
57756,Waaaaaaaaay smaller than advertised,57756,3
57757,I like the boot but ran too small..,57757,3
57758,There was a hole in one of the sleeve's hem that I didn't notice at first.,57758,3
57758,And it fits super fitted.,57758,3
57758,"I am a curvy girl (no really, boobs, booty and a tiny waist) and I wanted this to be flattering but still comfortable.",57758,3
57758,It is a lot more fitted than I expected.,57758,3
57758,"All that being said, I really love the print and I get so many compliments on it.",57758,3
57758,I just wish I had ordered a larger size and I wish that it had come to me in better condition.,57758,3
57759,"Cute, vibrant colors, runs VERY small.",57759,3
57759,"A 12-18 month size, in my opinion, fits more on the 6 month standard size.",57759,3
57759,"So, order WAY up.",57759,3
57759,"My baby is big, but these are definitely made small.",57759,3
57760,"This was a cute idea, awesome quality, the black n white pattern is not what I expected, way prettier online then in life.",57760,3
57760,I wish I had tried a solid color.,57760,3
57760,"I am larger on top, so I didn't like the fit on me.",57760,3
57760,"Maybe it was the pattern that threw me off, I dunno, but shipping sucked, I'm used to Amazon prime and I had to pay to ship it back!!!",57760,3
57760,Not to mention refund takes a few weeks!,57760,3
57760,So don't expect it to be a fast transaction!,57760,3
57760,I do wish it fit me better THOW!,57760,3
57761,"These sunglasses are cute, but they are not exactly as pictured.",57761,3
57761,The pair I received was not round lenses.,57761,3
57761,"They looked a lot like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ATTCL-2016-Vintage-Fashion-Round-Arrow-Style-Wayfarer-Polarized-Sunglasses-for-Women-11189-Leopard/dp/B00XMKM97W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ATTCL 2016 Vintage Fashion Round Arrow Style Wayfarer Polarized Sunglasses for Women 11189 Leopard</a>.",57761,3
57761,"I bought a pair of those too, so I wanted the rounder lens.",57761,3
57761,I still kept them.,57761,3
57761,For the great price I'd rather pass them along to one of my girlfriends than return.,57761,3
57761,"Now that I'm here writing a review, I see that the images uploaded by customers are accurate.",57761,3
57761,Not what is shown in the product image.,57761,3
57761,I hope that makes sense!,57761,3
57762,I also received a different patter from the one I ordered...,57762,3
57762,I like the patter I got but I'm definitely not going to order another like I had planned to because next time I might not be so lucky.,57762,3
57763,"Very cute product; however, it started to tarnish after only about a week or so of wearing it.",57763,3
57765,"The ankle elastic is too loose, and so the cuff rides up to below my knee while sleeping in cold weather.",57765,3
57765,I have to tuck the cuff into my socks and pray I don't have to leave the house in an emergency.,57765,3
57769,"somewhat smaller than expected, arm holes are way too constricting for me..",57769,3
57769,Pretty decent quality overall.,57769,3
57770,Be aware that the colors are nowhere near as vibrant as the pictures...,57770,3
57771,"I have a big behind that the only reason why it was too
Small.",57771,3
57772,Not a great buy,57772,3
57773,This was smaller than I expected and I figured I could wear it with shorts rather than as a cover up.,57773,3
57773,It shrank upon washing (which is to be expected) and stays horribly wrinkled.,57773,3
57773,I'm actually going to donate it.,57773,3
57774,products are nice but but two are too small even though i sent my size,57774,3
57775,This skirt looks nice and is probably perfect for a skinny girl.,57775,3
57775,"However, on me it's so short that my privates weren't covered.",57775,3
57775,"I have since bought black lace and sewed 4"" all along the bottom in the hopes of being able to wear it.",57775,3
57775,"The chain belt that is hanging in the picture is way too small for the skirt I received, it doesn't go all the way around.",57775,3
57775,"Again though, nice look on a skinny girl.",57775,3
57776,its cool looking but the proportions are way off.,57776,3
57776,I need to gain about 70 lbs to fit it in the chest while the arms are almost form fitting (and would probably rip if I gained 70 lbs),57776,3
57778,The shirt fit fine but the length was too long.,57778,3
57779,Long waisted (THANKS MOM) so it really didn't fit me.,57779,3
57779,Flagging as a 3 star for potential buyers who will ignore it anyway if this is even for sale next year.,57779,3
57780,"Fit small
 Quick delivery though .",57780,3
57781,Fits nice but very cheap material.,57781,3
57781,Felt like I was wearing a tshirt.,57781,3
57781,I always thought bodycon dresses were a much thicker material.,57781,3
57782,Get 1 size bigger if you need to buy these.,57782,3
57782,I just returned for a refund.,57782,3
57783,the panties are just fine but the fitting in the bralette is weird.,57783,3
57783,im a 32 b btw,57783,3
57784,"The model in the picture is more than likely a petite size, because I'm average and the dress is not that long.",57784,3
57784,I don't like the material either.,57784,3
57784,It's loud and can be heard anytime I move.,57784,3
57785,Nice but impossible to squeeze them to actually hang on septum.,57785,3
57785,So I really couldn't get the idea if I wanted to get the piercing or not.,57785,3
57785,Otherwise they were nice colorful.,57785,3
57786,Very cool but too big for a 3 year old.. a cub strap or something would help,57786,3
57787,Very pretty but the beads to do stay in place.,57787,3
57787,They look silly because they constantly flip out of place.,57787,3
57788,The fabric is SO heavy... it's hot and bulky and awful.,57788,3
57788,It doesn't go with the cute light and airy lace in the back at all.,57788,3
57789,Cute but listened to other reviews that said to buy one size up.,57789,3
57789,"Buy your regular size, this is loose and hangs off me, but I put a belt on it and it looks good that way, though I wanted to wear it loose.",57789,3
57789,Also very sheer and see thru.,57789,3
57791,"Looks good, bur ordered my regular size and was much too small.",57791,3
57791,Looking for someone to give it to.,57791,3
57792,It arrived sooner than expected.,57792,3
57792,"However it doesn't fit in, but I will wear it as a necklace.",57792,3
57792,"The letters are kinda blurry, but overall I am content.",57792,3
57793,"I love the shirt but the sizes seem to run a bit small, I usually wear a med and the large is a little snug",57793,3
57794,It has plenty of room and I will probably use it for vacations not for everyday use which I bought it for.,57794,3
57794,The adjustable straps keeps sliding so it does not stay in place which is very frustrating.,57794,3
57794,Zippers don't work properly all the time they get stuck.,57794,3
57794,I will not buy this again and am only keeping since it was a Christmas gift.,57794,3
57795,I can't review this item because I never received it.,57795,3
57795,The blouse I got was virtually the same in every detail except the fabric content--chiffon instead of poly/cotton blend.,57795,3
57795,The vendor responded quickly and made up the difference to my satisfaction.,57795,3
57795,"I can wear the chiffon, and it's quite pretty, but I would much prefer a cotton blend.",57795,3
57796,"Cute shirt, but I didn't think it would be a stretchy material.",57796,3
57796,It also fits snug on the arms and chest area.,57796,3
57796,"I ordered a large which I can wear easily, but this shirt didn't fit well.",57796,3
57797,"It looks just as the pictures do, but I do not like the material.",57797,3
57797,"It's not very soft, and therefore I will not be using it.",57797,3
57798,"Cute, cheap, but not high quality.",57798,3
57800,"Mesh fabric and style are nice, but pouch is too small for me and that fabric does not give enough to compensate.",57800,3
57800,Like the JINSHI Men's Bamboo Fiber Mesh Lining Briefs at the same XL size much better.,57800,3
57801,This belly wrap worked great for the first week.,57801,3
57801,I put it on 2 days after my son was born and it's on basically 23 hours a day.,57801,3
57801,It gave great support and I did noticed my belly shrinking within the first week.,57801,3
57801,"However, after just one week, I noticed the belly wrap started to get rolls on the side around my waist area and it would not stay put.",57801,3
57801,I have to constantly rearrange it.,57801,3
57801,"I'm not especially curvy, but i do have some curves.",57801,3
57801,"I thought maybe after i wash it, the shape would go back to normal, but i was wrong.",57801,3
57801,"Also, the sizing of the Belly Bandit is a little off.",57801,3
57801,"When i measured myself at 38 weeks pregnant, according to their sizing chart, I was a large.",57801,3
57801,But I had a feeling it would be too big and ordered a Medium instead.,57801,3
57801,"Just about a week after using it, the Medium i ordered became too big.",57801,3
57801,The Velcro area is too small and it forces you to purchase another size once you start to go back to your normal size.,57801,3
57801,But I will not be purchasing another one from Belly Bandit.,57801,3
57802,Didn't  like the fabric though... felt more like a swimsuit instead of skirt material.,57802,3
57802,Fit true to size.,57802,3
57802,"I'm 5'6"", 135lbs (37, 27, 37).",57802,3
57803,"Unfortunately, the dress snags very easily and I only wore it once.",57803,3
57804,Very cute but fits small I would probably get size or 2 up.,57804,3
57805,Ran small for me.,57805,3
57805,"I would say I am a medium, in this case buying a large would've been better.",57805,3
57805,"Material
is nice, but the cut of the torso is short.",57805,3
57806,"order a size larger than you need or it won't fit you (or you'll look like a sausage, trust me on that one)",57806,3
57807,They are pretty and I received compliments on them.,57807,3
57807,"However, they are small and light and I lost one out of my ear on the third wearing.",57807,3
57808,Super cool and good quality.,57808,3
57808,I bought it for my friend who is obsessed with Game of Thrones and she loved it.,57808,3
57809,"5' 6"" 150# bought medium.",57809,3
57809,No tag and not as flowy as the picture,57809,3
57810,The design was beautiful but was way too small and short.,57810,3
57811,The dress looks great though.,57811,3
57811,I bought a petticoat to fill it out.,57811,3
57812,"Wire broke through the material, looks hazardous.",57812,3
57814,The belt is cute and the material feels durable.,57814,3
57814,The actual circumference of the elastic is smaller than expected but it fit my size M/L waist comfortably.,57814,3
57814,The bow is stiff fabric but that just helps it look need and tidy.,57814,3
57814,"Despite all of that I can't give this product more than 3 stars because it arrived broken, missing a snap.",57814,3
57814,"I was able to fix it with a safety pin until I could sew on a new snap, but I was disappointed to be given a broken product.",57814,3
57815,Would be fine if the quality was a little better.,57815,3
57815,"Once it stretches, it doesn't snap back...it will stay a little stretched.",57815,3
57816,It's smaller across the chest than I thought it was going to be.,57816,3
57816,It's a little uncomfortable!,57816,3
57817,I need a large ball cap.,57817,3
57817,This one did not fit.,57817,3
57818,Adorable not too durable though last about 4months then the leather cracks and fades if it's in and out of pockets.,57818,3
57819,The boots are nice but the sizes run a little smaller than the size listed.,57819,3
57820,The top was a perfect fit.,57820,3
57820,"I purchased the mustard in medium, which I generally wear a medium so it fit great, but mustard color was not complimentary to my skin tone.",57820,3
57820,"I also didn't like the style on me, but all of why I returned shirt was due to personal preference, not because anything was wrong with top.",57820,3
57821,Very disappointed in this bag regarding size.,57821,3
57821,"The bag is 10x7x4, which is 3 in.",57821,3
57821,shorter than the given measurement.,57821,3
57821,Otherwise I wouldn't have ordered.,57821,3
57821,Can we get more accurate information on size?,57821,3
57821,"Also can't get as much in bag as you would think because the lining is fairly loose, which actually prevents you from getting items to fit.",57821,3
57821,"Will think again before buying from this brand, although I have one BOC bag that I do like.",57821,3
57821,Very hit and miss.,57821,3
57822,"These shoes are OK, but nothing extra.",57822,3
57822,Run small and narrow.,57822,3
57822,Take forever to ship.,57822,3
57823,I'm 5'10 156lbs and ordered a Medium.,57823,3
57823,The waist fits comforably but the thigh straps are a little tight.,57823,3
57825,Had no idea it aS coming from China and it doesn't fit at all like the picture.thankfully it still fit my daughter and she liked it just not what she wanted.,57825,3
57826,For one time use it's pretty awesome.,57826,3
57826,I got this for my husband a year ago.,57826,3
57826,He only wore it once.,57826,3
57826,This year we took it out of the closet to find that every single button had fallen off.,57826,3
57826,"I could always just sew more back on if I had a heads up, but he was going to wear it that evening.",57826,3
57826,"It's cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for.",57826,3
57826,"With that said, it's still very pretty.",57826,3
57827,The colors are really bright.,57827,3
57827,I thought from the picture that they looked like more fall colors.,57827,3
57827,The fabric is really soft and are comfortable except for the waist band.,57827,3
57827,The waist comes up to my rib cage and is really tight.,57827,3
57827,I will have to alter the waist band some how.,57827,3
57827,The pants them selves are not super tight but you can still wear with long shirt and boots and looks cute.,57827,3
57828,Didn't receive a free bracelet.,57828,3
57828,Color scheme wasn't as cool as pictures online.,57828,3
57828,Still pretty cool though,57828,3
57830,I freely admit that the first time i purchased this coat i picked the size i thought i needed and ignored the posted size chart.,57830,3
57830,I usually ignore the size charts so this was my lesson to learn.,57830,3
57830,Size charts are there for a reason and can be very helpful when ordering from a company for the first time so duly noted.,57830,3
57830,"That said, this coat is BIG.",57830,3
57830,So big in fact that it feels like you're wearing a tent.,57830,3
57830,"I returned the first coat, consulted the size chart, realized the error of my ways and ordered another that was two sizes smaller than my original purchase.",57830,3
57830,It came today and guess what...STILL A TENT.,57830,3
57830,"I'm not a small woman, in fact the first coat i ordered in a 1X because i wanted a comfortable fit with some room for thicker sweaters or layers and i thought that 1X would give me that.",57830,3
57830,I'm disappointed because i had high hopes for this coat to be my go-to choice in the closet but the second one is already boxed up and on its way back and i will not be ordering a third.,57830,3
57830,My other issue is less important and it's with the color.,57830,3
57830,I purchased the navy and it's a really dull and frumpy navy blue.,57830,3
57830,Could be the size issue affecting my overall opinion of the color but i just realized i didn't like anything about this coat enough to continue to play the what size should i really get game anymore.,57830,3
57830,"My advice to anyone considering this coat, it looks NOTHING like the picture with the model wearing it with her cute little sweater and jeans.",57830,3
57830,The coat has no form or shape to it.,57830,3
57830,No darts in the back to flatter the figure it just hangs.,57830,3
57830,"On the plus side, It does seem kind of warm and if you could solve the size mystery seems like it would be a really comfortable weekend coat.",57830,3
57830,So if roominess takes priority over style then this coat will definitely give you the room.,57830,3
57830,Just don't be like me and ignore the size chart.,57830,3
57831,material is sort of flimsy.,57831,3
57831,it's okay for play but seems expensive for what it is.,57831,3
57832,i would make sure you check measurements and sizing before you buy it,57832,3
57833,Thought it was smaller but not the fault of the seller.,57833,3
57834,"It's not bad, but sizing is VERY small!!",57834,3
57834,"I am pretty slim, and size small bottoms are way too tight.",57834,3
57834,It also isn't push up like it says.,57834,3
57834,"The design is a bit different than the picture, and looks a bit messier.",57834,3
57834,"Lastly, some stitching is messy and is pretty visible.",57834,3
57834,"But for the very cheap price, I guess it's a good deal!",57834,3
57835,"I ordered the top in Khaki, which turned out to be a decent tan color and ok with my olive skin.",57835,3
57835,"It fit okay (I'm a 36C US), no support, but would keep the girls pushed in-place.",57835,3
57835,The cup pads didn't show through a shirt.,57835,3
57835,"I ended up returning it because the one I received had the labeling printed on the wrong side, which showed through a white shirt, and could be seen when wearing an open-back shirt.",57835,3
57835,Wearing it labeling-out was the only way to have the openings for the cup pads on the inside of the bandeau.,57835,3
57835,"If I turned the labeling in, then you can see the openings for the pads when I lift my arms.",57835,3
57836,Didn't realize it would be so huge,57836,3
57837,"It's cute, and I wear it, but I don't wear it in public.",57837,3
57837,You can see through it a little.,57837,3
57837,And it hugs you at the waist.,57837,3
57838,It is too small and not as fitted in the top area as expected but it looks like the picture!,57838,3
57839,Loved the shirt but the arms aren't stretchy where the beading is an it's very tight,57839,3
57840,"I really wanted to like this baseball T.  It looks long and slim in the picture, but it is very wide and boxy and the arms are big and unflattering.",57840,3
57840,I also found the material hot and scratchy so I hoped that washing/drying the shirt would soften it (and maybe shrink it) but no such luck.,57840,3
57840,I should have just returned it.,57840,3
57841,"Nice plugs, especially for the price.",57841,3
57841,"However I made the mistake of not reading that it was not for a pair, only 1.",57841,3
57841,So I ordered another.,57841,3
57841,When it came the color was completely different.,57841,3
57841,More opal than white.,57841,3
57841,Sooo I now ordered a third one because I like them and just want a matching pair!,57841,3
57841,Fingers crossed it works out.,57841,3
57842,"Living on an island, I wear trunks as underwear most of the time (who knows when you'll end up wanting/needing to get in the water).",57842,3
57842,"I really like my TYR trunks, but at $25-$30 a pair, they're a bit on the pricey side to essentially be used as underwear, so I decided to try some cheaper options.",57842,3
57842,"These fit, but aren't super comfortable.",57842,3
57842,"There's no room up front for the goods, so they feel a bit restricted.",57842,3
57842,"I'm not exactly Ron Jeremy in that department, so it's not like I'm asking these shorts to accommodate anything more than average.",57842,3
57842,"They also Ken doll what you do have, so if you're wanting to show off, look elsewhere, though if you are particularly modest, these may be the route to go.",57842,3
57842,"They fit my waist, despite my belly's growing efforts, but cut into my thighs a bit.",57842,3
57842,"I have some serious quads from biking for years, so that may be some of it, but it's worth noting my TYR's don't cut in at all.",57842,3
57842,The fabric isn't terribly abrasion resistant.,57842,3
57842,You can tell where some of my shorts have seams because they've rubbed against these trunks and pilled them.,57842,3
57842,"The pilling is lighter in color, so it's fairly obvious that something is off from quite a distance.",57842,3
57842,"They haven't faded much, though I most of their time in the water is in salt water, so I can't really comment on their chlorine resistance.",57842,3
57842,"There is a liner, and while it's not terrible (doesn't itch, doesn't hold excessive amounts of water), it covers most of the front of these, (from waistband to leg stitching, starting at the front of the thighs) and occasionally causes the leg portion to shift around in weird ways.",57842,3
57842,"The stitching seemed fine at first, but I'm getting stray threads here and there, and I know I'll be at them with a needle and thread soon.",57842,3
57842,"For the money, they're not bad, but I need a bit more out of trunks and will probably bite the bullet and invest in more TYRs.",57842,3
57842,"I'll continue to wear these when my nicer trunks are in the laundry, but I have a feeling their life will be short, and I'm ok with that.",57842,3
57842,Once they area gone I won't be buying any more pairs.,57842,3
57843,Cups run large compared to other Body Glove tops in same size.,57843,3
57844,too tight for my chest,57844,3
57845,Didn't keep its stretch more than a month.,57845,3
57846,The sweater fits well (it is long enough both in the waist/hem and sleeves - 5'2' 130lbs).,57846,3
57846,The item said it was white but it is not white.,57846,3
57846,It is off white.,57846,3
57846,The only disappointment is that it is not white as I had wanted.,57846,3
57846,I also ordered another turtleneck from another store online that stated it is white and when it arrived it turned out to be off white.,57846,3
57846,Even the label on the packaging is whiter than the sweater!,57846,3
57846,"As others have noted, you can't tell which is the front or back (I will sew a few stitches in the neck with red thread so that *I* will know which is the back).",57846,3
57848,"I like the look but the belt is not as durable as I would like (the stitches were stronger than the material so the material ripped while the stitches held)

One of the pins connecting the buckle to the belt came out in less than a year",57848,3
57849,We got this for my sons lumberjack first bday party to wear for his smash cake.,57849,3
57849,It seemed a little small but is very cute for a little guy!,57849,3
57850,"BEAUTIFUL design, but FAR TOO SMALL.",57850,3
57850,I ordered an X Large and it fits like an overly tight muscle shirt!,57850,3
57850,Only reason i'm rating 3 stars is because the designs are absolutely gorgeous!,57850,3
57850,Next time I'll order XX Large and lose some weight lol,57850,3
57851,Kept falling out of my ears.,57851,3
57851,Despite the o rings being on and them being of the correct size.,57851,3
57852,OK. Bought xxl pretty much true to size.,57852,3
57852,"Belt was very small though, did not fit.",57852,3
57853,"Cute, but somewhat small.",57853,3
57854,I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review.,57854,3
57854,The item took forever to arrive so if you need them quickly i would take a pass.,57854,3
57854,They are very light light and do not stay in your ear.,57854,3
57854,I would put an ear ring back on each if you do not want to lose the.,57854,3
57854,I did enjoy the sparkle and received several compliments on them but they they do look inexpensive.,57854,3
57854,I would purchase again only as a fun pair of week end ear rings,57854,3
57855,Picture is totally different from the product I received and there's a huge emblem embossed on the front which made it look even cheaper!,57855,3
57856,I like the shirt but the X Large seemed more like a medium or youth x large.,57856,3
57856,I normally wear a medium or large and I found this to be a little too tight.,57856,3
57856,Definitely order at least one size above what you normally wear.,57856,3
57857,Just a bit too flowy for my body type.,57857,3
57858,love the coat but it runs really small had to return it,57858,3
57859,"Maybe a little ""full cut"" but OK",57859,3
57860,This top was very affordable and cute but it has it's pros and cons.,57860,3
57860,I ordered the wine color and it is beautiful.,57860,3
57860,"Arrived quickly
  3.",57860,3
57860,"No rips, tears, or strings
  4.",57860,3
57860,I love the cold shoulder cut and this one is well placed.,57860,3
57860,Be sure to size up for Asian sizing.,57860,3
57860,I ordered an XL and I am normally a M/L depending on the maker.,57860,3
57860,It comes with a bad smell and you need to wash it right away so it doesn't stink up your other clothes.,57860,3
57860,It is fine after 1 washing.,57860,3
57860,The elastic at the base of the sleeves is very tight.,57860,3
57860,It's wearable as long as you don't push the sleeves up.,57860,3
57860,If you do it feels like you are going to have your blood drawn.,57860,3
57860,My biggest drawback to ordering another color is the tight elastic sleeve which is why I gave this 3 stars.,57860,3
57861,"Out of the box, this watch looked just like the photo, and that I'm satisfied with.",57861,3
57861,"However, as I was adjusting the time, the crown came completely out and now just falls out and will not stay in.",57861,3
57861,I'm not heavy handed by no means so this makes me question the quality of it's other parts.,57861,3
57861,"Also, the hands do not glow in the dark.",57861,3
57861,O' well off to the jeweler to spend additional money for resizing and to hopefully fix the crown.,57861,3
57862,"Cute, but runs too small.",57862,3
57862,It was tight on my son during his swimming lesson and even left marks around his legs and made his belly itch.,57862,3
57863,Robe is smallish and the facings are not sewn down.,57863,3
57863,"Also, belt is not attached as description says.",57863,3
57863,"But the knit is nice, it is attractive, and it is affordable.",57863,3
57863,"Fine for the cost, but order up!",57863,3
57864,These shorts are also cut short.,57864,3
57864,That might be suitable for a a growing boy but not for a mature man who doesn't want to hang out.,57864,3
57865,Ended up keeping it although it fits more like a shirt and less like a cover up.,57865,3
57865,It is also itchy but not bad for the little money it cost.,57865,3
57866,It is a bit small.,57866,3
57866,This is a plus and a minus as it fits better and takes up less space.,57866,3
57866,However it could be just a little bit bigger and it would accommodate everything I need.,57866,3
57866,Other bags I have had zip from both sides.,57866,3
57866,This only has a single zipper.,57866,3
57867,order a small size !,57867,3
57867,this tee runs big !,57867,3
57868,Runs true to size... Don't order up,57868,3
57869,Way too tight on my babies legs.,57869,3
57869,Granted she is chunky.,57869,3
57870,I bought it directly at my size and When it reach its to big.,57870,3
57871,Loved the style and color but had to send it back.,57871,3
57871,Purse was much larger than it appeared,57871,3
57872,I loved the look of this but I'd you have a fuller behind on you this won't work out to well.,57872,3
57872,The bottoms inside are not removable and they run very small.,57872,3
57873,"these are cute shirts, and very thin light fabric.",57873,3
57873,they kind of look like like scrubs when I tried them on.,57873,3
57873,"the sizes run a little small, so go a size larger than you would normally get,  and if you have very large breasts go two sizes larger.",57873,3
57874,Didn't come with knee highs but came on time an doesn't fit exactly how I wanted it to but I can work with it,57874,3
57875,"Compared to all the other Marvel/DC underwear I've purchased on Amazon, this pair is the least flattering on my body type because it digs into my sides and thighs too much to be comfortable or look nice.",57875,3
57875,The material just isn't stretchy enough.,57875,3
57875,This is coming from someone who is a slim size 8-10 with a flat stomach and wide hips.,57875,3
57875,They do look awesome but I doubt the XL would fit any better considering how tight they are at my waist even when there's nothing there to grab.,57875,3
57876,"Shipping was great, took about a week!",57876,3
57876,"The shirt itself is MUCH larger than expected, but still fit well enough.",57876,3
57876,"The design itself is also somewhat off, will update with pictures later.",57876,3
57877,When u need cheap panties here it is.,57877,3
57878,"This dress was pretty and I loved the color (which is very true to the image on the listing) but I found that the dress ran small, even though I followed the size chart.",57878,3
57878,"It just looked kind of trashy/too tight, and since it's a pretty form-fitting style, I wouldn't want to roll into work looking like that!",57878,3
57878,"I might try ordering again in a larger size, and if I do, I will update my review.",57878,3
57879,Gave it 3 stars cause it keep coming unhooked and falling off.,57879,3
57880,I was expecting for this credit card wallet to be better quality then it was.,57880,3
57880,I eventually returned it for something better.,57880,3
57881,"Nice case, glasses are not real sold.",57881,3
57882,"Looks just like the picture, cheap and very cute, few days later it broke guess that's what happens when you spend money on some cheap jewelry",57882,3
57885,I got medium and too small around the arms.,57885,3
57885,"I'm 6-2"" and 195#.",57885,3
57886,it's see through and the top is too small.,57886,3
57886,i probably needed a one size up in the shirt but not in the shorts; those are stretchy and flowynot skin tight,57886,3
57887,Had to give it to my daughter who wears a medium and this was a large and it was even snug on her.,57887,3
57888,These were super cute but OMG they are sooooo small.,57888,3
57888,"I bought an 8 for my son who is seven, they were washed once, and now are unwearable!!!",57888,3
57888,They were an advent gift for my son and he loved them...for two days until they were washed.,57888,3
57889,"Very very light, pretty, but you can tell very cheaply made",57889,3
57890,Nice material but was too small for me.,57890,3
57890,Seller was easy to contact and deal with.,57890,3
57891,This cap was a bit smaller than I expected.,57891,3
57891,"I got it for my girlfriend who has a small head, and  the bill was definitely too small for her.",57891,3
57891,I am a bit disappointed,57891,3
57892,"it is ok, but pricey and not well designed as it fits the head ok, but it is a little short",57892,3
57893,"Very wide, but not overly long....",57893,3
57894,This is bigger than expected and the sleeves are sloppy.,57894,3
57895,I really do it..,57895,3
57895,But listening to the reviews I went up a size and got a XL.. Bad idea should have went with the large other then that very nice color and all.. Its a beautiful spring wear... Do not go up a size,57895,3
57896,This shirt is pretty and I like the pocket and sleeves print.,57896,3
57896,"But I followed the size suggestions and bought de L size when i am usually S to M, and the L one was too wide and long for me.",57896,3
57896,I am going to return it and i think i'm going to ask for the M one or maybe another style.,57896,3
57897,"The clip-ons are cute, but they are very large.",57897,3
57897,I wanted a dainty flower; these are not.,57897,3
57898,This necklace is a bit chunky.,57898,3
57899,Padding too thin to go without an extra bra,57899,3
57900,"I'm 5ft 6.5 inches, 123 lbs, 34C chest and I ordered a size 4.",57900,3
57900,"The dress was very pretty, it fit great except the neck was way too tight, and I feel like I'm a pretty slim woman.",57900,3
57900,"Besides the neck, the quality of stitching was just bad.",57900,3
57900,"The back of the dress, by my butt, did not lay flat because of bad stitching and the zipper was sowed on crooked.",57900,3
57900,I returned because of this.,57900,3
57900,It's a tight dress so it's important the back part looks nice and it just didn't.,57900,3
57901,Thin fabric  - which is fine for undershirts.,57901,3
57901,Shrinks more than expected - order 1 to 2 sizes too large.,57901,3
57902,I do love love these earrings and get a lot of compliments!!!,57902,3
57902,I did have to order a second pair because one of the earrings on my first pair turned green!!!,57902,3
57902,That was certainly a disappointment!!,57902,3
57903,Somewhat larger than expected.,57903,3
57903,Strong  chemical smell to the actual shoe that lasted for weeks.,57903,3
57904,"Its very cute, however its longer than I expected and the neck line is definitely not large enough to go over your shoulder.",57904,3
57904,Its very small actually.,57904,3
57904,Make sure you consider this before you purchase this item.,57904,3
57905,The dress is pretty but for a teenager the chest area is too big.,57905,3
57905,"My daughter looks like she's a ""C or D cup"" Not a very good look for a wedding.",57905,3
57906,Great material...just didn't fit my body...,57906,3
57907,The pants are not what I expected but they are ok,57907,3
57908,Will work for a while but I thought Champion made a much better quality shoe than was done so with this pair.,57908,3
57908,The bottom arch part of the shoe is good quality but the top is thin and it appears to be plastic like where the shoe laces are threaded.,57908,3
57908,I like to buy shoes that will last the entire school year and these will not last that long.,57908,3
57909,These are really big.,57909,3
57909,I thought they were clip on.,57909,3
57910,"As other reviewers have noted, this dress is see through even with the built in slip.",57910,3
57910,It works for private evening wear but would be very immodest as a sun dress unless you wear something underneath (both top and bottom).,57910,3
57910,"It runs a little small if you are plus size, especially in the hips.",57910,3
57911,I love the style but the clasp was stuck and i had to replace it myself.,57911,3
57912,Very comfortable but the slipper stretches out which make them big.,57912,3
57913,"Overall happy with the hat, but the fit was too small.",57913,3
57913,It was sized for a child instead of an adult.,57913,3
57914,"This ring is very sparkly and pretty, but the stones stick up too high for my liking.",57914,3
57915,The color is not as shown in picture..,57915,3
57915,It is a brighter green not darker green as shown.,57915,3
57917,It would be great if it fit.,57917,3
57917,The bodice is too short.,57917,3
57917,"At that price, I knew it was a risk, but I gave it a shot...took a few weeks to arrive, and it doesn't fit correctly.",57917,3
57918,The dress runs small which kept me from getting the elegant fit I believe this look could have.,57918,3
57918,The material was thinner on the top then on the bottom but I think a petite figure would love everything about the dress.,57918,3
57920,"The pendant is pretty, but writing on it is very very small.",57920,3
57920,"The chain is similar to gum ball machine quality, I planned on using my own chain anyways.",57920,3
57920,This pendant also comes from China and took about 3 weeks to arrive.,57920,3
57920,It did come with the funnel for filling which was nice.,57920,3
57921,"Arrived on time, ordered a size up and it is pretty short.",57921,3
57921,"I had intended to wear it to a nice event, but the length is more like a club dress.",57921,3
57921,"Overall cute, with a belt, otherwise it's basically a nightgown.",57921,3
57922,I love the top but I wish it was a little more loose around the stomach so go up a size if you have a bit of a tummy,57922,3
57923,U get what u pay for.,57923,3
57924,Pretty but hard to squeeze to tighten.,57924,3
57925,Large was way too large and medium was way too snug.,57925,3
57926,They come up just above knee.,57926,3
57926,Would like them better if they reached my thigh.,57926,3
57927,"like another reviewer said, the jewelry doesnt fit into the hollow needle.",57927,3
57927,I had the biggest monster of a time and endedup just shoving the jewelry through the raw hole.. it was really intense.,57927,3
57928,Cute pants but the lines are unflattering on the areas I'd rather not emphasize.,57928,3
57929,"It's a nice shoe however I ordered them in Red and was sent Pink, I had to send them back I don't wear pink shoes, I was very disapointed...",57929,3
57930,"Runs small, lace frays & ripa after a few washes",57930,3
57931,The size didn't seem true.,57931,3
57932,The chain clasp broke pretty much immediately (I think within the first or second wear) but it's still capable of hanging on as long as I'm not doing anything crazy with my neck that day.,57932,3
57932,It's fine and still looks cute.,57932,3
57932,"Like some of the other reviews pointed out, its a bit longer than it seemed like it would be, but that doesn't really bother me.",57932,3
57932,"It's cute, just cheaply made.",57932,3
57932,"That's not really a bad thing, you just get what you pay for, so be prepared.",57932,3
57934,I like the way it fits..My issue is I can't wear it under my uniform pants to work..My uniform fits close and you can see the imprint around my butt..I looooove the tummy part works.,57934,3
57935,"Got them for someone else, but might have to get a pair for myself too.",57935,3
57935,They seem to fit them well and their feet are much smaller than mine so I'm not sure...,57935,3
57936,"The decal was placed kinda low on the shirt so it seems little ""off"".",57936,3
57936,The quality of the decal isn't the best either because it fades/rubs away with washing.,57936,3
57937,"beautiful dress, odd fit.",57937,3
57937,"I am 5'1, 110 pounds and the corset part did not fit properly.",57937,3
57938,"fits really small, not for anyone with a chest",57938,3
57939,Would be cute if the sizing was more accurate.,57939,3
57940,They were a bit hard to get on my feet with the narrow ankles...,57940,3
57940,I'm a women's size 10.,57940,3
57941,The picture is a bit deceiving.,57941,3
57941,Very pretty but you have to buy something to wear underneath it.,57941,3
57941,I like what the model is wearing underneath it but don't know where to buy it.,57941,3
57942,turned my ears green,57942,3
57943,Not quite the same suit as the picture.,57943,3
57943,"It is poorly made and there is not good support in the chest area, other than that it's ok.",57943,3
57944,"I love this, wore this pretty much through the whole summer.",57944,3
57944,"I've paired this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonsee-Womens-Mandala-Print-Sleeveless-Halterneck-Vest-Crop-Top-S/dp/B01DLWVXIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonsee Womens Mandala Print Sleeveless Halterneck Vest Crop Top (S)</a>.",57944,3
57944,It looks great with this crop top.,57944,3
57944,I have not worn this by itself.,57944,3
57944,But it does look good with nothing over it.,57944,3
57944,The back straps design are fun to look at and add that hint of design you need for a plan crop top or for an outfit.,57944,3
57944,"This is my first bralette, I've ever bought.",57944,3
57944,I am happy that this bralette has cup inserts they aren't that stuff but enough for me to not be conscious that my nipples are showing.,57944,3
57944,The straps are supportive but that might because my cup size is 34A.,57944,3
57944,I do have to say the back straps can be uncomfortable at times but if you put lotion or coconut oil before putting it on it can help.,57944,3
57944,It can irritate the skin if it is a tight fit.,57944,3
57945,I am short-waisted and this top was too long for me so I returned it.,57945,3
57945,"Like the colors, though.",57945,3
57946,Good quality but Very small.,57946,3
57947,Flips while wearing it and it's starting to turn.,57947,3
57948,"Very Pretty, but WAY too small!!!!",57948,3
57948,Runs really small order up 2 or more sizes!!!,57948,3
57949,Glad I ordered a size up.,57949,3
57949,Seems that due to the screen printing design the shirt has less give and runs a littler smaller than normal.,57949,3
57950,Not exactly as it is pictured.,57950,3
57951,Too tight on the arm,57951,3
57952,Color is TOTALLY different than the picture.,57952,3
57952,I received a milk chocolate and Carmel in the fabric not dark chocolate and cream,57952,3
57953,IT just didn't look quite right so I returned it,57953,3
57955,"I would have given this skirt a higher review, but the seams on the lining's side seams are on the OUTSIDE!",57955,3
57955,"And yes, it's noticeable.",57955,3
57955,"Thankfully, I sew so I'm just going to remove the lining and put it back in correctly.",57955,3
57955,"Otherwise, this skirt is beautiful.",57955,3
57955,The color is exactly as pictured and the fit is great.,57955,3
57956,The collar is pretty but full of many thread ends that I needed to trim off.,57956,3
57956,Pay for what you get.,57956,3
57957,Decent shades for $12.,57957,3
57957,I wasn't expecting much so I'm not disappointed.,57957,3
57957,"No question they will break soon, but until then better to lose these than my nice sunglasses.",57957,3
57958,love it but I wasn't excepting it to be sheer material.,57958,3
57959,It fit but it was too tight.,57959,3
57959,I would never wear it in public.,57959,3
57959,I didn't realize that it's practically lingerie.,57959,3
57961,I have a short torso and this is still quite short and definitely more of a shirt than a dress or a tunic,57961,3
57962,Love this sexy outfit.,57962,3
57962,It makes my husband say I do again!,57962,3
57963,Once washed they got a little small.,57963,3
57963,So he was only able to wear them a couple of times.,57963,3
57964,"great stylebad quality, it is $27 so I don't expect it would look like a leather jacket.",57964,3
57964,I ended up return it because it has plastic smell.,57964,3
57964,I do love how it looks on me though so it took me a few days to decide to return.,57964,3
57964,This jacket size is smaller comparing to other brands.,57964,3
57964,"I am 5.3"" and  117 pounds.",57964,3
57964,"Usually I get small or extra small, but I choose medium for this jacket, it fits me well.",57964,3
57965,Color was off from photo.,57965,3
57965,Would not have ordered if i knew that.,57965,3
57965,Wanted it to match my jacket.,57965,3
57965,It would have if color was as pictured.,57965,3
57965,Hat not big enough to be truly slouchy.,57965,3
57965,"Deep enough but too narrow  I would never label it ""slouchy""",57965,3
57966,Cheaply made but it's pretty cute.,57966,3
57966,The tassels aren't as long as they look in the picture.,57966,3
57966,Overall it was good for the price.,57966,3
57966,Love the red color.,57966,3
57967,The trimmings on the bag were a bit loose so I was not impressed by that.,57967,3
57970,I love the look of this coat.,57970,3
57970,The inside lining of the coat is ripping and it was smaller than I expected.,57970,3
57970,I honestly live the coat and despite the rips I have no issues.,57970,3
57971,"It fit my waist,  the problem is that after a while the rods in it start to slip & it becomes uncomfortable and a nusence .I guess u get what u pay for",57971,3
57973,I gave three stars instead of only 2 because I actually really like the colors and pattern of this suit and I think on the right person it would fit well.,57973,3
57973,But for me--petite 5'2 110 lbs small bust--it did not fit.,57973,3
57973,"Well, the top did not fit.",57973,3
57973,The bottoms actually fit nicely.,57973,3
57973,Good bottom coverage which is appreciated as that is hard to find nowadays.,57973,3
57973,"And the height of the ""high waisted"" bottoms were just right and not TOO high.",57973,3
57973,As for the top--it fit horribly.,57973,3
57973,The overly molded cups and underwire were so uncomfortable and were almost pointed looking.,57973,3
57973,And were bigger than my actual bust so it just looked silly.,57973,3
57973,"But, again, on the right body and possibly for a larger busted woman, this suit might work and look good.",57973,3
57974,Pretty but they break after about 2 weeks,57974,3
57975,"If I wear this, I will have to have some shorts underneath it.",57975,3
57975,My butt is way to big and causes the shirt to rise in the rear.,57975,3
57976,"While the case serves its purpose as a protector of cards, frequent insertion into and removal from pockets of all types (coats, jeans, etc.)",57976,3
57976,will inflict noticeable wear after 2-3 months of continuous carry.,57976,3
57976,Threads begin to fray.,57976,3
57976,Adhesive begins to show.,57976,3
57976,Colored lining begins to fade.,57976,3
57976,"As far as design is concerned, the metallic gold symbol on my case (black pleather with blue interior and lining) is a total eye-sore.",57976,3
57976,"In fact, it's so unsightly that I almost didn't purchase the case (looking back, this was sound intuition), but the saving grace is that *other people* cannot see the hideous symbol if the case is opened facing the owner.",57976,3
57976,I needed a card case last minute.,57976,3
57976,This served the purpose.,57976,3
57976,"It doesn't look totally hideous now, but this is not what one would consider a ""quality product.""",57976,3
57976,"Again, you get what you pay for.",57976,3
57977,This shirt is much bigger then you would think..,57977,3
57977,"I got a small i'm 5""6 and i could wear this as a short dress...",57977,3
57977,"It is also high low, this is a very scratchy shirt too..",57977,3
57977,I do like it but not what i was expecting.,57977,3
57978,The charm is backwards...,57978,3
57978,So I'll have to get pliers and manually adjust it to be linked on correctly.,57978,3
57978,I guess accidents happen.,57978,3
57978,It's pretty and I'm excited to wear it.,57978,3
57978,Now it's a matter of what's more of a hassle: fixing it myself or returning the item.,57978,3
57978,I believe all products should be looked over before sold to a customer....,57978,3
57978,In order to ensure that quality is guaranteed.,57978,3
57978,Hoping I can just fix it myself.,57978,3
57979,is actually for kids.. not an adult.,57979,3
57980,"skirt is a little too long and the skirt is too flared (too much fabric) which makes it heavier when wet, but it fits well.",57980,3
57981,"Not true to size, but still is nice.",57981,3
57981,"Only whisk that they would put an actual tie that he could tie on his own, not a zipper tie",57981,3
57982,"Beautiful for teh price, very bad quality.",57982,3
57983,very very see through FYI,57983,3
57984,"They are neat, but they jab into my head a little too much...",57984,3
57984,"I don't know how they could change this, so just be aware.",57984,3
57986,Was not a perfect fit.,57986,3
57986,Really clear lense though.,57986,3
57986,Will try to make it work,57986,3
57987,It's really cute but it was super small.,57987,3
57987,Plus it's not an actual tommy hilifiger shirt.,57987,3
57987,It's a knock off,57987,3
57988,I got it because the arrow is a representation of strength to me.,57988,3
57988,"Love the shape and size of the necklace, but after just a couple weeks of wearing it the clasp broke and fell off so there is no way to wear the necklace now.",57988,3
57990,"These were very thin, most women would not want to wear them unless it's underneath clothing.",57990,3
57990,"My bra size is 38 DD, so I had to wear 2 of them to feel like I had more support.",57990,3
57990,I was recovering from an illness and didn't want the hassle of wearing a bra but also didn't want it to be obvious that I wasn't wearing one.,57990,3
57990,"These did the job very well as long as you don't plan on being too active, like running a marathon or doing jumping jacks.",57990,3
57991,runs very long even with high high heels.,57991,3
57992,It was small for me I usually wear large but this was a bit tight .,57992,3
57992,The quality overall is OK for the price .,57992,3
57992,The color is true to picture.,57992,3
57993,It's for a granddaughter and I think she will like it.,57993,3
57993,The chain is cheap and you have to look hard to see that it's a cat.,57993,3
57994,Feels like a nice jacket.,57994,3
57994,But should have ordered a size bigger.,57994,3
57995,the laces started to fray after about a month of use.,57995,3
57995,"they have since stopped fraying, but i can only imagine that the the fraying will increase in the future",57995,3
57996,I ordered 2 of the same shirts (different designs) from Awkwardstyles.,57996,3
57996,"The other one was cute & slouchy, this one was HUGE.",57996,3
57996,I ordered 2 larges & this one fit like an XL or maybe 2XL.,57996,3
57996,Im debating on keeping or returning it.,57996,3
57996,It would still be comfy to sleep in.,57996,3
57997,The picture looks much bigger this product was very small,57997,3
57998,"It arrived on time, nice product, I just didn't like it.",57998,3
57998,Specifically the movement of the purse.,57998,3
57998,It was too flexible for me.,57998,3
58000,only complaint is that its not real polo its a knock off,58000,3
58001,I've only worn it a week though and some of the tiny stones have come out.,58001,3
58001,So that's a bummer.,58001,3
58001,I have been washing my hands with it though so maybe that's why ;),58001,3
58002,"The material is great but it runs too big, as you can see in the pic the are both small and you can notice the difference.",58002,3
58002,The top size is fine.,58002,3
58003,"The quality of the jacket is okay for the price, lining and zippers are good, the color is somewhat different than the photo, but i liked it anyway, is more like a chocolate or brown than the taupe that is shown here.",58003,3
58003,"what really bothers me is the fit, I'm a small guy (5' 7"" and 130lbs) and the S who is the smallest size is way too big fo me, the fit is baggy and not modern or slim like they claim, it also rest far below my waist and make awkwards folds when i sit down who is strange because i don't find sleeves lenght being too long (for a short guy).",58003,3
58004,"It is fine for the price,size fits perfect but pretty cheaply made",58004,3
58005,Turned brown and made my wrist green after a month.,58005,3
58006,"Very cute, but it was WAY too big.",58006,3
58007,Fits nice and feels good.,58007,3
58007,Exactly what I was looking for in size and weight.,58007,3
58007,"However, the design is barely etched into the surface, not engraved.",58007,3
58007,It's very faint and almost unnoticeable.,58007,3
58007,Not real happy about that.,58007,3
58008,The dress is pretty well made and fit according to the sizing information given.,58008,3
58008,I had to take off due to the poor job done on sewing the Starfleet symbol and the ink stain that was on the front of it.,58008,3
58008,"I was finally able to get it out, but it took some doing and I don't feel that I should have to work to get stains out of something I bought new.",58008,3
58008,I was given a $5 refund for my troubles.,58008,3
58008,"I would recommend getting this, especially for the price, just know that you may have to put some effort into getting it ready to wear.",58008,3
58009,I had to sew it to reinforce the material.,58009,3
58009,The first item they shipped wasn't even the right one.,58009,3
58011,"I ordered these for my sisters in law's lockets and when I recieved them, they looked more like blue topaz than emerald.",58011,3
58011,Packaging was easy to get into as it was just an envelope,58011,3
58012,"Cute socks, but way too big for my 7 month old.",58012,3
58013,Cute skirt but it is quite thick material,58013,3
58014,front of shoe somewhat flimsy,58014,3
58015,Very big and bulky.,58015,3
58016,The hat would be a lot nicer if they didn't crunch it into a plastic bag to ship it to me causing awkward creases in it so it won't fit right and looks like I sat on it for a month.,58016,3
58016,"It can't even be worn when it arrives because you have to spend forever ironing out the folds they make, reshaping the crushed flower and re shaping the hat to fit properly.",58016,3
58016,"Once you go through all that, if you get it to look right youll have yourself a decent hat.",58016,3
58016,Why these sellers don't just use a proper box to ship these is unbelievably ridiculous and cheap of them.,58016,3
58017,My niece loves it.,58017,3
58018,not bad but could be smaller,58018,3
58019,"After reading the reviews, i purchased a size up from what i would normally order (I'm typically a large).",58019,3
58019,Ended up being way too big across the chest!,58019,3
58019,Had my roomate help me alter it.,58019,3
58020,"It's very cute, very short.",58020,3
58020,"So, could be a perfect length for someone  a little shorter.",58020,3
58020,I  still wear it though.,58020,3
58021,A little tight around the armpits.,58021,3
58021,It also seems to stain or mark easily.,58021,3
58022,Wish they came up to my waist.,58022,3
58023,"Cute top, but runs big and was baggy in the back.",58023,3
58023,Might get a smaller size.,58023,3
58024,The sizes on these dresses from seller to seller are over the chart!,58024,3
58024,"An XL from another seller was tight on my chest, but HUGE on my waist and butt.",58024,3
58024,This one...in medium...was ok on my boobs...with bad pleating...and also huge below but with a crooked waist seam that made me look 13 months pregnant.,58024,3
58025,They are nice but they are not rose gold they're yellow gold.,58025,3
58025,I would give them 5 Stars if they were actually rose gold,58025,3
58026,"Gave it 3 stars because its too short , barely made around my neck",58026,3
58028,This is a beautiful bathing suit but it was just too small for my long torso.,58028,3
58028,I'm 5'10 so to find a one piece that fits can be a challenge.,58028,3
58028,"Unfortunately, this bathing suit didn't work for me.",58028,3
58028,"Besides that, it is a really nice bathing suit, feels well made and it has support cups in the bust.",58028,3
58028,I ordered a size 12 and it fit my body really well (besides being too short) - I'm about 200 lbs and it seemed to slim the areas that I like slimmed.,58028,3
58028,I would definitely recommend this if you don't have a long torso.,58028,3
58029,Was drawn to this for the colors and the cut.,58029,3
58029,"The cut is nice, flattering as pictured.",58029,3
58029,I find rompers are often not flattering and look sort of boxy but this one is really nice.,58029,3
58029,"On the downside, it's not very easy to move in--the seams don't stretch which accounts for minus a star.",58029,3
58029,"Most disappointing was that the base/background is light yellow, but the first photo makes it look white.",58029,3
58029,I looked carefully at the other photos after receiving it and noticed it is faint yellow.,58029,3
58029,Not as cute as white would be!,58029,3
58029,Maybe there is a way to fade it.,58029,3
58029,"If you don't mind that, go for it.",58029,3
58030,Ring that holds pendant to the chain arrived open.,58030,3
58031,"chain is super long goes past your breasts, but the pendent looks just like the picture",58031,3
58032,Initial impression is that they are as advertised.,58032,3
58032,"They are listed on Amazon as ""Baban 0.8-2.0mm Watchmakers Tools Quality Set 8 Screwdrivers Including 8 spare heads"" They DO NOT come with any spare heads.",58032,3
58032,It is 8 screwdrivers with 8 heads.,58032,3
58032,Will update once I've used them a few times.,58032,3
58033,The medium fits like an extra large.,58033,3
58033,It remains in the original packaging unworn.,58033,3
58034,Size was way too small so either was mis-marked or their sizing is wrong for USA market.,58034,3
58034,Nice quality and looked like it would be comfortable.,58034,3
58034,"Ordered size 36 and it only measured 27"" so will have to figure out what size to reorder.",58034,3
58035,"I liked the look and feel of material, but since it was kind of all at the arm holes.",58035,3
58037,"You have to wear white undies or no underwear, do to the pattern or different color undies showing through the light color of the dress.",58037,3
58037,"Other than that, I have received many compliments on the dress and it fits well and is stretchy fabric.",58037,3
58039,"The style look nice ,but the material I don't like.",58039,3
58040,It's not as cool as the photos show.,58040,3
58040,"Although, it's still pretty nice looking.",58040,3
58041,"I was pleasantly surprised by how cute this set acutally is, but when I tried it on, I discovered that the SM is definitely geared towards someone with a much smaller bust and larger band size than my petite 30 DD.",58041,3
58041,Probably would fit someone closer to a 34B.,58041,3
58041,"The panties, however, definitely run on the small side.",58041,3
58042,It fits kind of funky in the back.,58042,3
58042,Might have to remove 2 of the strings in back so it looks right.,58042,3
58042,The color is spot on.,58042,3
58043,I don't like the style on me.,58043,3
58044,"Not for small people in shape, decent material but better for women who need to find and tuck away stuff but comfortable",58044,3
58045,Doesn't do much for the person it was given too sort of dissapointed,58045,3
58046,"Very comfortable and thick, but useless without treads at this point in his life.",58046,3
58046,Based on the size/age we picked I thought they would have treads since by 12+ months babies are active.,58046,3
58047,"I enjoy low rise briefs made by other companies such as xuba, seobean, croota and some other small brands.",58047,3
58047,"These are nice and sexy, I'm a size 32"" waist and I ordered a medium, which is fairly small, and I only wear small underwear.",58047,3
58047,It really does fit very snug and really regret not ordering a size larger.,58047,3
58047,"Breathing room isn't a problem since these are mesh and open so it isn't awful, its just more intimate than other men's underwear.",58047,3
58048,The shirt itself is really pretty but runs very small.,58048,3
58048,I mostly wear a size small.,58048,3
58048,I am very small on top.,58048,3
58048,I got this in a large and the shoulder area and arms were way too tight.,58048,3
58048,"I have amazon prime and the only size for free ,2 day shipping is a large???",58048,3
58048,I would have gotten this in an XL  but don't want to wait weeks to have it sent to me.,58048,3
58049,"It's not what I thought it was going to be, but I like it.",58049,3
58049,The material was not what I thought it was.,58049,3
58050,These fit as expected but I also imagined them to be much thinner/lighter.,58050,3
58050,I need them as a part of costumes for various dance gigs.,58050,3
58050,They are thick and will be hot for gigs in Arizona.,58050,3
58051,Really cute but super small for a XXXL,58051,3
58052,The picture makes the color look more vivid than it actually is after being under the light.,58052,3
58052,The pendant was a little larger than I expected.,58052,3
58053,It's Okay about sums it up.,58053,3
58054,Overall this kimono is pretty cute.,58054,3
58054,It's fairly big on me though - the arms are long on me (I'm 5'2) and it kind of looks like it's swallowing me.,58054,3
58054,It's hard to wear with shorts because it's so long so I almost look like I'm not wearing bottoms from behind.,58054,3
58054,It's also a little more see through than I thought it would be.,58054,3
58054,"Based on the pics I thought it wouldn't be very sheer with bright coloring, but it's pretty sheer and the colors are more dull than I thought.",58054,3
58055,Ordered a large and it was too big.,58055,3
58055,Ordered a Medium it was better but not snug like I wanted it...,58055,3
58055,Guessing I should get a small.,58055,3
58055,The material is great.,58055,3
58056,That is why I bought it.,58056,3
58057,This costume cannot be worn - it can only be kept on the baby's bottom and the baby must be expected to stay absolutely stationary.,58057,3
58057,"Since most mom's know that is not possible, I really don't think this costume is for anyone except professional baby photographers who only deal with sleeping newborns.",58057,3
58057,Though even my newborn wouldn't remain that stationary!,58057,3
58058,I guess it is slightly small because of asian sizes.,58058,3
58058,It took a long time to get delivered.,58058,3
58059,"Wife's review:
This came as the right size as far as body fit, but was extremely short compared to what was shown in the photos.",58059,3
58059,The dress part only comes to the middle of my thigh as opposed to a below-the-knee fit I thought it would be.,58059,3
58059,"It's also very thin so it will be nice in the summer, but the white linen is fairly translucent.",58059,3
58059,The sleeves of the coverup are also much shorter than advertised - more like a short-sleeve tee.,58059,3
58059,"(for reference I'm 5'7"" and ordered a medium).",58059,3
58060,I ordered the tank based on the size chart.,58060,3
58060,Got a large even though I'm normally a medium.,58060,3
58060,It is too big and is very long.,58060,3
58060,The baby picture is actually below my crotch not anywhere near my belly.,58060,3
58060,"I did wash and dry and it didn't help:(
Very nice quality but graphic needs to be higher ( for the record I have a long torso so if you have a short torso the baby would be at your knees.)",58060,3
58061,My daughter loves these!,58061,3
58062,Not as thick as advertised will need a size smaller..other than that its a nice ring...,58062,3
58063,It's a nylon material and a lot shorter then the picture.,58063,3
58063,It'll be a good workout shirt but nothing else other then that,58063,3
58064,I loved the top and it actually fit my DDD boobs but the wire poked out the first time I wore it and I just don't know if the price is worth the one time use.,58064,3
58064,"I actually wore the top with different bottoms I purchased (black with polka dots) because while they fit fine, the other ones were more slimming and these felt almost diaperish(??)",58064,3
58064,"but I may end up wearing them sometime in the future, who knows.",58064,3
58064,So basically I'm not saying stay away but the underwire poking out before I ever even washed it was disappointing so fair warning.,58064,3
58065,I suppose I should expect the quality for what I paid.,58065,3
58065,"It's not bad, but not as thick as I had hoped.",58065,3
58065,"The hood is separate, and the blue plaid only goes as far as the sides of the hood to tuck into the buttons.",58065,3
58065,Interior of the coat is black.,58065,3
58066,"I sent this back for an easy refund because the hips were too large, and I'm still a slightly curvy woman.",58066,3
58066,Fabric far too thin.,58066,3
58067,"The shirt weight is very heavy and stiff, like the free shirts you get for promotional items when you fill out a credit card application or something.",58067,3
58067,"I find those shirts to be less comfortable and less stylish (""stylish"" is of course relative, but by that I just mean not something you'd normally wear if you're under 45 years old).",58067,3
58068,"I ordered a large because I expected it to run small, but when it arrived it was definitely a top not a dress.",58068,3
58068,Looks cute with jeans but not what i was expecting.,58068,3
58069,I purchased this for a 50s outfit and read the other reviews before I purchased it.,58069,3
58069,"I will keep it, and wear it for the specific event I bought it for.",58069,3
58069,"However, the fabric is not terribly comfortable.",58069,3
58069,I purchased a Large hoping for a little give as I am 60 and just don't have time to sacrifice comfort for style.,58069,3
58069,It won't be worn very often for anything other than a costume piece.,58069,3
58069,Will probably give it to someone younger and smaller.,58069,3
58069,"I am long waisted, and this hits at about my natural waist.",58069,3
58070,"After reading the reviews, I thought I would need to go up a size to make sure this item fit.",58070,3
58070,"I am 5'7"" with a pear shape, but I could have purchased a medium instead of the large, because the large was too long and wouldn't stay up over my bosom and crotch.",58070,3
58070,"To me, it looks just like the picture and could have been a great purchase if it had been the right size.",58070,3
58070,This material is very stretchy and I feel like it became more stretched out and too big throughout my night of wearing it.,58070,3
58070,I would recommend that you know your real size for THIS type of clothing and buy your true size.,58070,3
58070,Don't go up a size unless that's what you always do for bodycon outfits.,58070,3
58071,Absolutely love this bathing suit......As long as you don't plan on swimming in it.....,58071,3
58071,The second it gets wet it becomes completely sheer!!,58071,3
58071,Thank god I figured this out in the comfort of my home and now at the beach.,58071,3
58072,I didn't think that the V-neck went down as far as in the photo.. but maybe i should have sized up (again !,58072,3
58072,"haha) I had to order a ""large"" and it fit like a small.",58072,3
58072,But I have a fairly smaller torso so it actually fit perfectly.,58072,3
58072,"It did have a chemical smell, but I'm sure it just needs to be washed.",58072,3
58072,I like it overall though : ) It's fairly soft and comfortable !,58072,3
58073,I get so many compliments but it's short!,58073,3
58073,I kind of wanted to wear it with leggings but it's no where close to covering even part of my bottom.,58073,3
58073,Maybe it's not for adults...,58073,3
58074,not bad-needs more padding,58074,3
58076,On the small side.,58076,3
58076,Tight but making do for a pirate birthday party with no time left to do anything.,58076,3
58076,I always get a medium women's or a small and fits fine.,58076,3
58077,I would not buy again.,58077,3
58079,very small a little disappointed but gave to my sister whom liked the bigness of it,58079,3
58080,Fabric is good too.,58080,3
58080,The only problem: the clips won't stay!,58080,3
58080,Wore it with panty hose for that I needed.,58080,3
58080,Haven't wore it again!,58080,3
58081,I have to be more careful I wear an large to extra large and this coat had a sticker in it saying 5XL when I got it.,58081,3
58081,It was still to small I did not realize it was from another country until I got it.,58081,3
58081,I really like it to bad they did not have my size.,58081,3
58082,I ordered a large...could not get it on.,58082,3
58082,I wear 42 to 38 in some clothing...size is small for a large listing.,58082,3
58083,I ordered a Medium and need a small.,58083,3
58084,"Cheaply made, but it served it's purpose.",58084,3
58085,"I read all of the reviews & photos before ordering this suit, so I knew there was a 50/50 chance that it would fit.",58085,3
58085,"I'm 5'7"", 160 pounds & super busty.",58085,3
58085,Bikini tops are always a struggle for me but I gave this a shot anyway & ordered the XL.,58085,3
58085,"The bottoms fit great, but I'm a 34E and I was definitely spilling out of the cups on the top.",58085,3
58085,"The band and straps fit fine, but the cups were just sooo small.",58085,3
58085,"Unless you're a 34D or smaller, I don't think this top will fit.",58085,3
58086,It is a nice necklace besides the fact that I had to cut some of the black leather off because it was really big.,58086,3
58086,other than that it as fairly nice.,58086,3
58087,So I ordered the green and blue block patterned one in XL.,58087,3
58087,I'm usually about a L but i wanted a bit more flow.,58087,3
58087,"While the colors are super pretty, it is huge and the block pattern is horizontal instead of vertical at the armpits and waist so it's not flattering at all.",58087,3
58087,"This pattern specifically is probably better for a tiny, non-curvy body type.",58087,3
58087,I do like the shirt enough to consider a different style in a smaller size.,58087,3
58088,I am unable to wear this.,58088,3
58089,It runs a bit small.,58089,3
58089,My 7 month old is filling it out completely.,58089,3
58089,"He's in the 80th percentile for size, so is a bit bigger than average, but no where near the size of an 18month old so I would assume that this may fit a smallish 12 month old for a couple months at best.",58089,3
58089,"The colors faded a little bit in the wash, so after one washing it no longer looks brand new.",58089,3
58089,It is sleepwear after all.,58089,3
58091,Beautiful but far too small and tight :(,58091,3
58092,The bottom was perfect but the top was to small I wear a C cup.,58092,3
58093,Love the print but she won't she able to wear till like August if she's lucky.,58093,3
58095,"Note: if the gloves are cold or your hands are cold, they're going to stay cold.",58095,3
58095,But they look really good and are good to protect your hands from the elements.,58095,3
58096,Beautiful print but if you have hips and thighs this isn't meant for you.,58096,3
58096,"Mine fit perfectly up too, and in my mid section however was very tight on my hips and things.",58096,3
58096,I recommend going a size bigger.,58096,3
58096,"I'm 5'3"" 150lb 34D and I ordered a Medium.",58096,3
58097,"Bought 2 necklaces, chain for my sister's necklace broke and there is a bubble just near the bottom on the other one that makes it hard to see the cat peeking on one of the necklaces.",58097,3
58097,Fast delivery on reg.,58097,3
58097,"shipping from China, it arrived before Halloween and has until Nov. 22nd to be delivered.",58097,3
58098,"Covers with blue hearts SMH, saving for my grand-daughter.",58098,3
58099,"Shirt material was very odd, seems like it could be used as a swimsuit.",58099,3
58099,Overall the quality was exceptional for the price & received before estimated delivery.,58099,3
58100,"Arms super long, if you roll up the sleeves ok.",58100,3
58101,"Nice dress, great price, its a little simple, but for the price really a good bargain.",58101,3
58101,It does run a bit small so I ordered it a size up and it fit my wife perfectly.,58101,3
58101,"She initially liked it because she thought the toole would cover more, but it's very sheer, so if ur looking for a more modest style of dress that goes below the knees, I'm sorry to say that the front falls a few inches above the knees, the back of the dress is ok in that regard, apart from that the dress looks reasonably well made and arrived fairly quick.",58101,3
58102,"Ordered a size ""women's 8/10"" and received a size ""small.""",58102,3
58102,"Kimono is very cute, but slightly different from the photo in the item description.",58102,3
58102,"Sleeves are longer, and the shoulders are ruched (see photos), which I wasn't expecting.",58102,3
58103,"Item came as described, however leather material on outside was not durable enough and is starting to wear after a few weeks of use.",58103,3
58103,I bought this for 9 dollars it is now much cheaper.,58103,3
58104,Definitely order your size.,58104,3
58104,"I liked the way it looked more fitted, but then I was worried about tearing the delicate lace when I moved my arms.",58104,3
58104,"So I returned it and bought the next size up, but that feels way too baggy.",58104,3
58105,Love the blouse's look.,58105,3
58105,I received many compliments but the sequent section in the sleeve is itchy.,58105,3
58105,It makes direct contact with skin thus making it uncomfortable.,58105,3
58106,They're perfect for an evening gown.,58106,3
58106,"I recommend better,  proper and more secure packaging.",58106,3
58106,It was not easy taking it out of the plastic package.,58106,3
58107,"It is cute, but one button hole was sewed shut and the outfit was too big.",58107,3
58108,"Looks lovely, but sticks up off of the finger about a mile.",58108,3
58108,Don't buy if you want something more flush with your fingers.,58108,3
58109,Beautiful shirt but you might want to get a large if you wear a medium.,58109,3
58109,or X large if you wear Large.,58109,3
58109,"The sizes are China Doll size, I believe?",58109,3
58110,"Like the shirt but the sleeves are a little tight, this was really made for a skinny person as I am just shy of being skinny.",58110,3
58111,The color is great exactly like the picture and the material is great very thick!,58111,3
58112,I bought this top searching for products I could use as baselayers under my work clothes; I'm in the process of picking out gym clothes I can wear under my work clothes so I waste less time changing at the gym.,58112,3
58112,The fabric is attractive and the top appears well-constructed but I will have to return the top due to the fit.,58112,3
58112,"While the top fits well around my chest and shoulders (it could be tighter, but I think I'd get enough support from the shelf bra) the fabric scrunches too much around my torso to be discreetly worn under anything.",58112,3
58112,"That said, it's also not loose enough that I would attempt any sort of activity where I'd be anticipating a serious sweat--the fabric is thick and while that's great for support and diminishing the ""headlight effect"" there is no way you'd be able to seriously sweat in this thing and move on to any less intensive activity without being seriously uncomfortable.",58112,3
58112,"I might consider it if the top fit tightly, but with the bunching up there's no way this thing could accomplish any sort of wicking action.",58112,3
58112,This top might be for you if you're a bigger size and looking for something you could wear as a base layer for cold weather activities where you wouldn't be sweating intensively or as your primary top if you won't build up a serious sweat.,58112,3
58112,"For a reference, I'm 5'4"", 33"" chest and 26"" waist.",58112,3
58113,Not enough room for my equipment.,58113,3
58114,Looks a little different though .,58114,3
58114,The blue in the picture is brighter than it is.,58114,3
58115,For the price it's super cute!,58115,3
58115,It doesn't have the best finished but for this price you can't beat it!,58115,3
58115,And it's real leather,58115,3
58116,"I know they aren't ""spendy"" but one pack the earring was bent funny in the package.",58116,3
58116,Afraid to bend it to much as I don't want it to break.,58116,3
58116,One bridesmaid doesn't wear  earings so I guess I'm OK.,58116,3
58117,"The v neck is very deep, deeper than the picture shows, at least in my case.",58117,3
58117,Almost at your navel.,58117,3
58117,My slit was torn thru by the time it got to me and I wear 4/6 but got the medium and it was still to tight.,58117,3
58117,Shipped pretty fast tho.,58117,3
58118,It's beautiful but unfortunately it was too short to fit my neck.,58118,3
58118,I don't have a huge neck so I was disappointed with this.,58118,3
58118,I will have to give it away,58118,3
58120,"Larger than I thought it would be, the shoulder strap is too long; had to pin in to shorten it.",58120,3
58120,"Otherwise, I like all the pockets, and the color.",58120,3
58121,the skirt fit as expected the down fall is the waste line was twisted up a little bit,58121,3
58122,Cheap look material but nice for the price,58122,3
58123,"They run somewhat small and are 100% cotton, so likely to shrink.",58123,3
58123,Recommend you buy 1 size larger.,58123,3
58123,"XL is more like between an L and XL, so go w/ 2XL.",58123,3
58124,I really like these.,58124,3
58124,I feel like the sizes run a little small.,58124,3
58124,I'm going to order another pair in the next size up.,58124,3
58124,"material is a little cheap but as long as your not pulling hard where the seems are, it will be fine!",58124,3
58125,Overall love the shirt.,58125,3
58125,But had to get a rip seamed.,58125,3
58127,I would give them five stars if only the company would make these in a  WW or even WWWW (4E) width for people with problem feet.,58127,3
58128,"They are super cute, run a little small but unfortunately a strap has broken on 2 of them and I haven't worn them but maybe 7 or 8 times",58128,3
58129,Its alittle small hoping it stretches some,58129,3
58131,I like them but they fit a little big I would order a size smaller,58131,3
58132,Shirt was a bit larger than I expected but the real tragedy is hat I washed it to wear it ahead of the new movie coming out next Friday and the color in blue bands around the Neck and arms ran into the white..,58132,3
58132,VERY disappointed followed wash and dry instructions and this still occurred.. Really pissed about it!,58132,3
58132,Avoid at all costs unless you want a new wash cloth for your car this summer..,58132,3
58132,"3/28/16
I have to amend my review a bit.. the shirt was a good quality and looked awesome..",58132,3
58132,I believe I may have gotten a defective one so I won't judge the company on one bad product since they quickly refunded my money without me asking.. great customer service guys!,58132,3
58134,A little small but think we can use,58134,3
58135,My I Phone 6 Plus did not fit,58135,3
58138,I had purchased two other dresses and did not like the way this looked as much as I liked the others .,58138,3
58139,previously bought a white one it was nice so I got this one for other outfits still nice product but there are cuts/ rips near hem like someone cut other fabric atop it and button came off while trying on,58139,3
58140,"It's very pretty, I love the flowers.",58140,3
58140,"The material is thin, I worried it might be see through but it doesn't seem to be.",58140,3
58140,It fits a little tight around arms/bust.,58140,3
58140,I am a C cup but do have bigger arms/shoulders so it is probably true to size.,58140,3
58140,Just something to consider.,58140,3
58140,The torso length is good and leg holes fit well and true to size.,58140,3
58140,*** adding to this about 7-8 mo later.,58140,3
58140,"I wear this about 3 x week, rinse my suit after each swim and wash it once/week.",58140,3
58140,Always drip dry and the backside of the suit has completely worn out already.,58140,3
58140,"Yes, I use it weekly but it is still disappointing to have it wear out already.",58140,3
58141,Way way way way way too big.,58141,3
58141,Bought a size 12 of which my niece is in at the moment and went by measurements.,58141,3
58141,She has a long body and this is way too big.,58141,3
58141,So disappointed as the class already started and now we must buy in town.,58141,3
58142,"No wires just foam cups, can't tighten anything to help.",58142,3
58143,I love the sneakers but the lights don't work as they should after the 1st time charging them.,58143,3
58145,If it had fit me better I would have loved it.,58145,3
58145,I ordered the smallest size but still too big for me.,58145,3
58145,I'm very petite though.,58145,3
58146,I usually wear a misses XL ..after reading the reviews purchased an XXL and glad I did shirt definitely runs small!,58146,3
58146,Shirt kin da lays weird in the front around the gathering ..it's blouses out a bit and kinda makes you look like you have roll..however if one has a larger midriff that blousing will camouflage it nicely,58146,3
58147,"Is nice, but shows all the panty lines and bumps in the area.",58147,3
58147,"Plan on wearing with spanx or if your lucky with your genes, nothing.",58147,3
58148,Glad I ordered large but was a little thinner than I like and had to keep pulling up kept sliding down.,58148,3
58148,Will have to wear with long shirt.,58148,3
58149,I ordered a small and it is quite loose.,58149,3
58149,"I wasn't looking for something that would hug my body, but I was hoping for some definition.",58149,3
58149,This just looks like a really big t-shirt on me.,58149,3
58149,"It doesn't cinch up very much, so the draw string was no help.",58149,3
58149,I am just under 5'4'' and pretty small framed.,58149,3
58150,This bikini bottom fit weird - large in the front and very small in the back.,58150,3
58150,"May work if that's your shape, but if not, avoid.",58150,3
58151,the style is nice buy its a very thin would prefer if it was lined,58151,3
58152,"When I put it on, the lace made it look tacky.",58152,3
58152,Took out the lace and now it looks much better!,58152,3
58153,Runs small up a size,58153,3
58154,"For me it was not as expected, was about 4 inches to short for my body type and wasn't thrilled with the fabric.",58154,3
58155,Have to knock off stars for durability.,58155,3
58155,About 2 months of use with about 9 cards inside.,58155,3
58155,The rubbery grip part inside the elastic strap if falling off about 3 weeks ago.,58155,3
58155,I still really like the wallet.,58155,3
58155,"Huge space saver, but bummed that it's already slowly taking apart.",58155,3
58155,Haven't used a wallet since getting a smart phone.,58155,3
58155,Can't fit both in  same pocket.,58155,3
58155,"Now I can if i wanted to, I put the crabby with my keys instead.",58155,3
58155,I barely feel it with 8 cards inside I added a caribiner so could loop into my jeans belt loops and know I won't lose it.,58155,3
58155,The grip on the elastic is nice.,58155,3
58156,cheaply made and buckle keeps getting undone.,58156,3
58156,it won't stay on,58156,3
58157,"A little smelly but oveall the shoe look god like the pics, my 3 stars are bc they came way too big, my son probably will wear them in 2 more years!",58157,3
58157,I followed the size guide tho,58157,3
58158,"I purchased this for my niece, the bracelet is very nice, but it does look a little cheap.",58158,3
58158,"The leather braided band had more of a sheen than I expected, and my stones were a little loose, so I'm not sure how long it will last.",58158,3
58158,"The magnetic closure is awesome, and I love the color and style.",58158,3
58159,The length of the torso was a bit short and I kept having to readjust because of it.,58159,3
58160,Disappointed these aren't embroidered.,58160,3
58160,According to the photo posted they look like they should be.,58160,3
58160,For the price I wouldn't of purchased.,58160,3
58160,It's just an iron on print.,58160,3
58161,A bit on the small side.,58161,3
58161,Doesn't cover the face as much as I would like.,58161,3
58163,Will wear them anyway around house.,58163,3
58163,Would not go out in public.,58163,3
58163,Would nice if they sent me a small size.,58163,3
58164,good quality but i ordered a large and it came in fitting like an xs runs very very small,58164,3
58165,I was so excited about this clutch and it arrived the day before the ball I'm attending.,58165,3
58165,"It barely fit my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone, but I managed to get it closed.",58165,3
58165,I knew it was small so I just hoped that my phone would fit once it was delivered.,58165,3
58165,"I was disappointed because most of the larger rhinstones were really foggy so they didn't have the same shiny appearance as the other small rhinstones covering the clutch, and the foggy stones were very noticeable.",58165,3
58165,The larger rhinstone also have noticeable scatches right out of the box.,58165,3
58165,There are 2 medium rhinstones that look as if they are about to come off.,58165,3
58165,It came with a short and a long chain.,58165,3
58165,"The short chain was already attached, and I loved it.",58165,3
58165,"I really wanted to try the long chain, and I was extremely disappointed when the long chain wasn't even able to be attached.",58165,3
58165,"One end of the long chain was glued shut preventing me from attaching it, and the other end was broken off right out of the box.",58165,3
58165,Attention to detail was not a priority based on my purchase and overall impression.,58165,3
58165,"Although I'm disappointed in the defects, the ball is tomorrow night so it'll have to do.",58165,3
58165,"I am NOT completely satisfied with this purchase since there is a sticker on the box that says ""Your Satisfaction Is Our Unremitting Pursuit.""",58165,3
58166,Tore the first time I put my finger through the end piece.,58166,3
58166,Reinforce before you try.,58166,3
58167,It's a little tight but I like it,58167,3
58168,The seam on the inner thigh  from below the crotch to above the knee was completely missing.,58168,3
58168,Looked like the bobbin in the machine had run empty.,58168,3
58168,"I have a sewing machine, so was able to fix it, otherwise would have had to return them.",58168,3
58168,"Had to restitch a couple  other seams that looked like they could fail, but this was only on the straight seams.",58168,3
58168,The decorative seams along the outside of the legs were perfect.,58168,3
58168,"If you order these, be sure to check the stitching to make sure it is intact.",58168,3
58170,The skirt is beautiful - nicely made - but I ordered a large and it is more like a small - teeny tiny waist,58170,3
58171,It is pretty sexy and hot.,58171,3
58171,I love when wearing it how when i brush across my penis it feels naked and free.,58171,3
58171,However i did get the wrong one.,58171,3
58171,I prefer thongs or g strings.,58171,3
58171,Also after wearing this it cuts off circulation under my penis.,58171,3
58172,Slightly long and tight fit makes it a little difficult to walk,58172,3
58174,"This is a very cute swimsuit, HOWEVER sizing seems to be an issue for these swimsuits.",58174,3
58174,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase China Large/US Medium.",58174,3
58174,"For reference my bust is 34 inches, waist is 26.5 inches, below my belly button is around 30 inches, and hips are about 36 inches.",58174,3
58174,"Usually, I am a small in my tops and medium in my bottoms because, for my frame, my butt and hips are a bit on the larger size.",58174,3
58174,"I am 5'2"" and have a pretty average build.",58174,3
58174,"Most reviews said to size up, but I think I should've purchased China Medium/US Small because I was swimming in this swimsuit.",58174,3
58174,The bottoms almost came up to under my boobs and the top was way too roomy for me.,58174,3
58174,I really like it and I need it for a trip next Monday so I'll be returning it for a smaller size.,58174,3
58174,When that one arrives I'll update my review.,58174,3
58174,"Edit (7/6): Changed to 3 Stars from 4
I returned this and purchased one size smaller and the bottoms were just right, but the top was still too big.",58174,3
58174,I normally am a small in tops and medium in bottoms.,58174,3
58174,I wish there was an option to purchase the tops and bottoms separately.,58174,3
58174,"Anyways, if you are normally the same size in both tops and bottoms then you probably won't have an issue.",58174,3
58175,I ordered a 2XL.,58175,3
58175,I wear a size large shirt in the US.,58175,3
58175,I weight 150 pounds and can't wear this shirt.,58175,3
58175,Be very careful in size selection.,58175,3
58175,"The product looks great, but clearly I don't understand UK sizing.",58175,3
58175,"I love the shirt, but I can't wear it.",58175,3
58176,"The top is ok, but the  bottom  is a little  bit  too small",58176,3
58177,Great starter watch for my boyfriend.,58177,3
58178,Cheap material but hey i get what i paid for.it is really nice for the price.,58178,3
58179,I purchased this at the beginning of my pregnancy (10 weeks) in anticipation of my clothes not being able to fit.,58179,3
58179,"At 12 weeks, a little earlier than I expected, I was no longer able to button my pants, and it was at this time that I decided to bust out the Bellaband that I had waited to wear!",58179,3
58179,"It fit as expected, I am a size 0 in pants (petite person in general, 5'1"" 95 pounds pre-pregnancy) and I bought the smallest size.",58179,3
58179,"The Bellaband fit well over my jeans and other pants, but what I found to be uncomfortable about it was that since you need it to cover the zipper of your pants, that means that it needs to go the same distance down on your back end.",58179,3
58179,"It has a sticky edge on the elastic so that it will hold onto your pants better; however, I still found myself tugging on the back as well as the front throughout the day to keep it down and because it needs to go so low to cover the zipper.",58179,3
58179,It ended up feeling more uncomfortable even though the point of it was to make pants MORE comfortable and non-maternity pants wearable.,58179,3
58179,"Just go buy maternity pants, you'll need them anyway!",58179,3
58179,I bought a pair after a few wears of the Bellaband and I have never gone back.,58179,3
58179,"Maternity pants are much more worth it, just save yourself the trouble and go get them and enjoy your growing belly!",58179,3
58180,"Cute dress, but it is VERY short.",58180,3
58180,Material quality feels decent for the price.,58180,3
58181,"Right off the bat, I gotta say I ordered the vintage worn out design and received the regular navy instead.",58181,3
58181,This is becoming too common a trend on shirts that I've ordered through various outlets through Amazon over the past year.,58181,3
58181,Where is the accountability?,58181,3
58181,"I get so annoyed that I have to pay money for shipping back something that someone else screwed up on, so I often just keep the shirt unless.",58181,3
58181,"Anyways, RANT OVER lol.",58181,3
58181,"The shirt itself is decent quality, I'd say middle of the pack, not super soft, but not sand paper.",58181,3
58181,"Fits as expected, a lil looser in the chest and arm pit/ short sleeve area than I personally prefer, but that sort of thing is based on body type and just being a lil nitpicky.",58181,3
58181,Would've given 4 stars if I received the design I ordered.,58181,3
58182,nice shirt but it had a button down collar not as depicted in product image and over-priced.,58182,3
58184,"There's a lot of range in baby sizing, and our guy is growing like a weed, but this thing was quite small for the size we ordered.",58184,3
58185,"I don't know who came up with the sizing on these, but I am 5'5"" and 115lbs and a B-cup and I don't think I would fit in anything smaller than a medium.",58185,3
58185,The pockets are for decoration only in that a phone or pretty much even a credit card will just fall out.,58185,3
58185,The sleeves are a decent length which I appreciate.,58185,3
58185,"I don't think these are worth more than $16, but I did buy 3 different colors in the 95% cotton fabric.",58185,3
58186,"The chains where a bit longer ad thicker then I expected, but till what I wanted overall",58186,3
58187,"It's adjustable, so you'll be able to get it on your head... but the shape is kind of boxy and not appealing at all.",58187,3
58187,It's a shame I bought two; seems it was two too many.,58187,3
58187,I would advise buying a different hat.,58187,3
58189,returning this one - kept the medium,58189,3
58191,"I believed the bathing suit to be more of a green tone, but it is actually black.",58191,3
58191,"Besides that the quality is actually pretty decent, but the bathing suit does run a tad small.",58191,3
58192,Cannot wear an tight around my breast,58192,3
58193,This is a good quality workout shirt.,58193,3
58193,I got a xl and it fits like a med.,58193,3
58194,The medium size was huge.,58194,3
58195,my purses are too large for these.,58195,3
58196,Had to go back.,58196,3
58197,They are nice glasses just seem to be a bit smaller than other Clubmasters and are pretty tight around my head.,58197,3
58197,I find this wierd because other reviews said that the glasses were too big.,58197,3
58197,Possible I just have a fat head haha,58197,3
58198,I kept this one on my wish list for the longest time before finally purchasing.,58198,3
58198,"For one thing, there are two different flower patterns being modeled in the product's photos, so I was curious to see which one I would actually get.",58198,3
58198,"As it turns out, I got a completely different flower pattern, as you can see.",58198,3
58198,"That's all well and good, but I had to wash this dress before trying it on; it absolutely REEKED of a chemical stench when it arrived.",58198,3
58198,"Plus, I was quite disappointed to see that the dress color is not as white as it appears in the photos, but has a yellowish off-white tinge instead.",58198,3
58198,The inner slip is very short; it barely covers my butt.,58198,3
58198,"Other than that, it's a rather nice summer dress.",58198,3
58198,"I'm 5'5"" and I ordered the small, and it fits me perfectly.",58198,3
58198,"The slit comes up about halfway up my thigh, and the straps are more comfortable worn on the shoulders than on the arms, as it is shown in the product's photos.",58198,3
58199,It was a great purchase.,58199,3
58200,Nice product for the price.,58200,3
58201,"It fit my 5'0, plus-sized girlfriend OK....but all the other comments are spot on; the material is thin, no borders sewn in the top material.",58201,3
58201,"I'd advise the maker to use a denser fabric, and sew a hem on the top material (to give better support).",58201,3
58201,"It's really not worth $13 price tag, but its' design is great.",58201,3
58201,"Just make it with denser material, and hem the several yards of material you used for the top, and you'll have a much better suit.",58201,3
58201,I'm going to get an old thin black bra from my lady and sew in a bra to the material.,58201,3
58202,"Kindve smaller than they make it look to be, and it's not that well made, but other than that it's not that bad of a product",58202,3
58203,The dress is nice but it is made rather cheaply.,58203,3
58203,Straight out of the box there was a button in pieces... cloth button cover and button cap were in the bag loose.,58203,3
58203,The color is beautiful and true to the picture.,58203,3
58203,The top portion is loose/too large.,58203,3
58203,Trying to work out the button issue with the seller.,58203,3
58204,Was smaller than expected and color was lighter shade of blue than indicated in the picture.,58204,3
58205,Fabric collects lint and hair very easy.,58205,3
58205,But it is very comfortable.,58205,3
58206,"Cute wallet, although it does not have 9 card slots, it only has 5.",58206,3
58206,Still like it and will use it though.,58206,3
58207,The quality of this dress was cheap.,58207,3
58208,the shoulder straps are too wide apart so there are a lot of tops I cant wear this with,58208,3
58209,"kinda small and cheapy, but the price is right!",58209,3
58210,I thought the dress was pretty but it runs very small.,58210,3
58211,"This dress was good quality and a nice color (not quite as vibrant a blue as the photo, but still pretty), but it was really large.",58211,3
58211,"I typically wear a size 12/L/XL and ordered a large, based on reviews that stated the dress ran a little on the large side.",58211,3
58211,"When I received it, the dress was really wide.",58211,3
58211,"I am busty (DDDD) and it fit in the chest area, but basically just hung straight down from there, as the waist was giant.",58211,3
58211,"Reviews were mixed on the length of the dress, but many of the ones from people who said they were in the 5'-5'4"" range said it came to their knees.",58211,3
58211,"I am 5'4"" and it came about 6-8 inches above my knee.",58211,3
58212,Took longer than expected to get.,58212,3
58212,I guess it is a popular style as it's flattering to many body shapes.,58212,3
58212,I purchased one size up from my normal size to ensure a good fit.,58212,3
58212,"Sadly, the top is far too skimpy, I solved the problem by adding a sport bra under the top to ensure maximum coverage.",58212,3
58212,The bottoms fit fine.,58212,3
58212,I love the boy leg short and the tank top.,58212,3
58212,"Overall, I got what I expected because I read the other reviews.",58212,3
58212,"The top is best described for flat chested women, if you are at all busty, you will need additional coverage or risk over exposure.",58212,3
58213,The fit is good and they are exactly as pictured but the black had scratched off of them quite a bit due to packaging.,58213,3
58214,"Ordered a medium when I usually wear a small, and glad I did.",58214,3
58214,"I am able to make this shirt work, but it was definitely off.",58214,3
58214,The button is sewn in the armpit so I had to remove it and sew it on the shoulder.,58214,3
58214,There is also no button hole so I use one of the knots to wrap it over the button.,58214,3
58214,Many seams are unfinished so it feels like it will unravel easily.,58214,3
58214,"Tassels are also just cut fabric from the shirt, not stitched at all.",58214,3
58214,"Still, if you don't mind getting handy, the overall look is cute.",58214,3
58214,Just know you get what you pay for!,58214,3
58215,"The sleeves were short, but other than that it fit pretty true to size.",58215,3
58215,"It is a pretty heavy sweater, but feels like it is cheaply made.",58215,3
58215,We will see how well this holds up to washings and wear.,58215,3
58216,"This wallet is reasonable for the price, but I was disappointed to find that the mesh lined panel that holds a picture ID (such as a drivers license) has already separated along the top of the wallet after about three or four weeks of usage.",58216,3
58217,OK BUT NOT MADE TO STRONG,58217,3
58218,It's cute but small.,58218,3
58218,Couldn't get it to fit on.,58218,3
58218,"Maybe my neck is to big, idk.",58218,3
58219,"A little loose on my head, and using the tightest setting makes it look awkward.",58219,3
58219,I usually try to button it on the fourth button.,58219,3
58219,"Other than that, it looks nice, and I got lots of compliments each time I wore it.",58219,3
58219,I wear this hat about once or twice a month.,58219,3
58220,I loved it but lost with in just a week or so.,58220,3
58220,The clasp apparently wasn't strong enough to keep it from unhooking as I was out & about shopping.,58220,3
58220,Sad because it was beautiful.,58220,3
58220,Don't know if I will order it again.,58220,3
58221,"I was disappointed in these-the pictures make it look like they have the comfort band around the waist, but it's only on the outside.",58221,3
58221,"They do seem well made, but the main reason I bought them was for the comfort waist.",58221,3
58222,Doesn't fit as I expected.,58222,3
58222,"I'm 5'2"" and it wasn't long enough for me.",58222,3
58222,It runs small in my opinion.,58222,3
58223,When I opened  the package the chain immediately broke and then I had to get a new chain so the chain is not very resistant although this necklace is really stylish.,58223,3
58224,Fit my pinky and Im am only 5 9  165 lbbs,58224,3
58225,"A lot more ""flowy"" than expected.",58225,3
58225,I am 8 months pregnant (5'5 and 140lbs currently) and I felt like I was swimming in the dress.,58225,3
58225,It truly depends on what you are looking for.,58225,3
58225,It doesn't hug to any curves because of the excess material.,58225,3
58225,"In addition, I didn't realize the upper part of the dress (above the waist line) was ribbed material and in my opinion it made the dress look cheap.",58225,3
58226,"nice hat, but size is not accurate.",58226,3
58228,"I am making efforts to slim down so when I tried on the garment, I was not surprised that it was a bit snug.",58228,3
58228,Another thing I must mention is that it is a bit too short but I will alter it somehow.,58228,3
58230,It's not good to have have big arms like I do,58230,3
58231,"I really wanted to like this, but it looks like a little beard coming out of my nose.",58231,3
58231,"It's good quality and shipped fast, just not my style.",58231,3
58232,"Pretty piece, relatively cheap but expensive looking.",58232,3
58232,Just need to wear with the right neckline.,58232,3
58233,The only thing I dislike is the side pockets will not stay fastened,58233,3
58234,Love the dress but it's kind of short.,58234,3
58235,"Beautiful,  was shorter than I thought though I am 5'5 and only fell to my waist,  but overall nice for the price",58235,3
58236,Fit was super tight on me and I wear a S/M normally in leggings...,58236,3
58236,Completely see through which means I can't wear them at the gym which is why I bought them.,58236,3
58237,"Very good quality, hope it can be bigger as an XXL..",58237,3
58238,The top has extra long back straps while the bottoms do not cover anything.,58238,3
58238,The back is almost as small as the front.,58238,3
58238,"I tied up the back straps, quite uncomfortable when lying down, and purchased a pair of bottoms from another seller to replace the tiny bottoms.",58238,3
58238,"After I find a day to cut off the extra length on the straps and sew it together, I will be happy with the top.",58238,3
58238,The front of the top is shaped well.,58238,3
58238,"I can't fix the bottoms, and so, can't wear them at all, but, I hope to make adjustments to the top",58238,3
58239,But they look adorable on my boys.,58239,3
58241,I wish it had more compartments though.,58241,3
58241,But overall it's great,58241,3
58242,for one summer its ok,58242,3
58243,I purchased this knowing it ran small so ordered XL.,58243,3
58243,I am little curvy at 145lbs 5'2.,58243,3
58243,Ordered for beach cover up since other reviews said it was super short hence it is a mini-dress.,58243,3
58243,"Lace looks good, dress is more off white than white, don't quite like the balls that hang on dress but it works.",58243,3
58243,I love this and it was worth the price I paid!,58243,3
58246,"These look a lot more faded than I expected, so that's fine if that's what you're going for.",58246,3
58246,They are very well made.,58246,3
58247,A bit see through... very light fabric.,58247,3
58247,I have to lengthen the top straps.,58247,3
58248,This is more necklace than expected.,58248,3
58248,I haven't found the right out fit to wear it with yet.,58248,3
58248,Bery dramatic piece but not a lot of sparkle.,58248,3
58249,The top and bottom where not the same size so it fit kinda funny,58249,3
58250,Son loved this watch.,58250,3
58250,"The seconds knob broke off so it's definitely made cheaply, but it's cheap enough that we ordered him another one.",58250,3
58250,Hope it lasts longer.,58250,3
58251,good but the size is smaller,58251,3
58252,Cute shoes for the price especially!,58252,3
58252,Off white in color and run large.,58252,3
58252,Plan ahead...they took a little while to be delivered,58252,3
58253,Overall craftsmanship could have been a little better.,58253,3
58254,The dress was too large.,58254,3
58254,"There is no zipper in the back, which made it hard to fit snugly.",58254,3
58254,We ended up returning it.,58254,3
58254,"It was well made and the fabric was nice, just wish there was a zipper in the back as well as the lacing.",58254,3
58255,"Not as supportave as the Maxx, and yet still thicker than the competing superfeet offerings.",58255,3
58255,I ended up returning them.,58255,3
58256,"I got a pair of Margaret Emer pants through Stitch Fix but wasn't willing to pay the $80 to purchase, so I found these as an alternative.",58256,3
58256,"The pros: good stretch, fit true to size, extremely comfortable and look cute.",58256,3
58256,It feels like you're wearing leggings!,58256,3
58256,"The cons: tummy control is laughable - there is a thin piece of white fabric in the ""tummy area"" but it is not connected to anything.",58256,3
58256,Don't expect these to do anything for tummy control.,58256,3
58256,"The pants are very thin, so if you need to wear spanx for tummy control, forget about it, you'll see them straight through.",58256,3
58256,These pants are also VPL (visible panty line) city.,58256,3
58256,Pants feel as though they will stretch out very easily.,58256,3
58256,"The booty sag had started by the end of the day and without belt loops, it's impossible to combat.",58256,3
58256,"For the price, not bad.",58256,3
58256,"If you want something thicket and better quality, I would look elsewhere.",58256,3
58256,Not sure if I'd purchase again at this price.,58256,3
58256,Maybe if they were $20-$25 I would.,58256,3
58257,Too tight around ankle and leaves marks.,58257,3
58258,the material is good quality except for the top part which unsewed.,58258,3
58259,"super cute, just make sure you buy a size larger than what you normally get.",58259,3
58260,They're bigger than I thought they'd be.,58260,3
58260,One of the needles got stuck in its holder and when I unjammed it the holder ripped off.,58260,3
58261,Beautiful material and very pretty.,58261,3
58261,I wear large and bought an extra large and it was still snug.,58261,3
58262,Very cut and fairly comfortable.,58262,3
58262,"It doesn't have a lot of stretch to it, but it is comfortable.",58262,3
58262,The heart has faded though after several washes.,58262,3
58262,"Overall an okay but, but due to the fading I would not buy again.",58262,3
58264,This bag is much larger than I expected.,58264,3
58264,The strap is hard to adjust.,58264,3
58264,"Otherwise, it is fine.",58264,3
58265,I ordered two other colors that fit great.,58265,3
58265,The blue fit differently..... was smaller.,58265,3
58265,"I like the larger fit better...,,",58265,3
58266,These are not huge as others have said.,58266,3
58266,They fit about the same as any brief this size.,58266,3
58266,"However, I had to rip out the tag because it was bothering my daughter.",58266,3
58266,"Even after I removed it, she said it was bothering her sometimes.",58266,3
58266,The COVERED elastic (love that feature) at the waist is thick/a bit bulky and that might be the issue in her dicomfort.,58266,3
58266,But she hasn't complained the last couple weeks so hopefully she's breaking them in or they've softened with washes.,58266,3
58266,They're pretty and I think the fabric is a good quality but I won't buy this brand again just because my daughter was somewhat uncomfortable in these.,58266,3
58267,"The detail is really well done, so much so I actually though the little shirt had lace sewn on the front to make it stand out.",58267,3
58267,"Though that was not the case, it still is a very cute shirt",58267,3
58268,I loved the pattern on this pants and the material was nice but unfortunately they were too small.,58268,3
58269,The one that was sent to me has LONG SLEEVES!,58269,3
58269,It is Poorly made not really at all like the picture.,58269,3
58269,But it will do.,58269,3
58270,NOT TRUE TO STANDARD SIZE.,58270,3
58270,REQUIRE TWO SIZES MORE TO FIT A LARGE.,58270,3
58270,"TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO YOUR SIZES WERE TRUE TO ""SIZE.""",58270,3
58270,MAIDENFORM LADIES TUMMY TONING BRIEFS.,58270,3
58271,"are too large, because are the number of men, not big kids",58271,3
58272,Color faded fast but I still have some of them.,58272,3
58272,Clear nail polish works,58272,3
58273,Wish they were longer,58273,3
58274,"Cute, but seem to run kind of small.",58274,3
58274,I don't think my daughter will be able to wear these for as long as I had hoped.,58274,3
58275,I purchased the Toddler Kid Christmas Pajamas for my four year old son and he loved them.,58275,3
58275,They were super cute and the image on the top was clear and vibrant.,58275,3
58275,The bottoms however faded after the first wash and are a really pale color now.,58275,3
58275,The quality of the fabric is nice but definitely better on the shirt than the pants.,58275,3
58275,My son is a bit small for his age but these p.j.,58275,3
58275,'s have fit nicely since right before Christmas and still fit him close to a year later.,58275,3
58276,It's a nice dress and I bought according to my measurements but it's much too small so unfortunately it's going back.,58276,3
58277,Tight in the sleeves.,58277,3
58278,nice and confortable but somewhat small.,58278,3
58279,"These are nice and I love the prints, but they are not as advertised.",58279,3
58279,They do not open up all the way but rather just have a larger neck opening.,58279,3
58279,They are easier than typical bodysuits to get on and off but are not what I expected.,58279,3
58280,"This dress has two layers, but it's still completely sheer.",58280,3
58280,You'll definitely need a slip to wear underneath.,58280,3
58280,But it was only $13 and it's going to work fine for what I need.,58280,3
58281,Looks Richer In Pic.,58281,3
58282,The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the bottoms fit phenomenally.,58282,3
58282,The top was like trying to put a cantaloupe into an orange peel.,58282,3
58282,I would not recommend this to anyone above a DD,58282,3
58283,its not a normal shirt.,58283,3
58283,a large is actually a small,58283,3
58286,looks fine from far away but close up the details are all messy and some of them were messed up and then you can see where they fixed it but not very well,58286,3
58287,"As a tall thin guy, it has always been a problem to keep my shirt tucked in until I discovered shirt stays about three weeks ago.",58287,3
58287,I tried another brand of shirt stays that was fairly comfortable and did a slightly better job at keeping my shirt in place (and was easier to disconnect in case you have to do any sit-down business in the restroom.),58287,3
58287,"The connectors broke on those after only two weeks of wear, so I tried this brand.",58287,3
58287,"They are supposed to be worn with the loop around your heel, but this would likely only work if your were about 4'6"" tall: the straps are at least about two feet too short!",58287,3
58287,"I can still wear them as a 6'2"" guy, but only because the loop is just big enough to be comfortably worn just under my knees!",58287,3
58287,"Its better than no shirt keepers at all, but I have since ordered another brand to see if I can get better.",58287,3
58288,"These are pretty flimsy, but I just wanted something casual to wear when I'm home.",58288,3
58288,They're actually very cute.,58288,3
58288,Just make sure to wash them on the gentle cycle and hang dry if you want the lace to stay put.,58288,3
58290,"like it, not a sexy as I hoped",58290,3
58291,This is lightweight and the color was great--but I found it to be tight and the material very clingy.,58291,3
58291,The arms were tight and I wanted to play tennis in this--but it's just too restricting in the arms.,58291,3
58292,"After using these 3 times, I think I can make a reasonable comparison to my previous pair, which I bought at Target in 2014 and wore over and over again without noticing any change in quality.",58292,3
58292,"Overall, these are not a bad product - they do work.",58292,3
58292,I wore them twice in tropical weather (read: sweaty!),58292,3
58292,"and once to a wedding, and they hung on very comfortably.",58292,3
58292,"However, they're not perfect.",58292,3
58292,"The thin plastic edges keep folding over and getting stuck on the adhesive, creating a little ridge around the outside of the cup.",58292,3
58292,And after the 3rd use I noticed that a little of the adhesive stuck to my skin and came off of the inner corner of each cup (the end next to the clip).,58292,3
58292,I think I will get a few more wears out of these but they're not terrifically durable.,58292,3
58292,"Finally, I find they run a bit small - I bought C cups, but they are barely bigger than my previous pair, which was B.",58292,3
58293,Sticks up too high,58293,3
58294,"The description ""distressed"" brought me to assume the material of the shirt would've been broken in, but it was clearly the logos that were... that's why you read rather carefully, oh, and never assume unless necessary!",58294,3
58294,"Like the shirt reguardless, Mahalo",58294,3
58295,I thought this was engraved and it is not.,58295,3
58296,Doesn't look the same as it is at all.,58296,3
58296,It looks like a mattress design,58296,3
58297,Ordered the large based on hat size and it runs small.,58297,3
58299,Does not look like the picture unless you are very tall.,58299,3
58299,But it's a nice sweater so I am giving it away to a taller friend.,58299,3
58300,Really pretty but already broken!,58300,3
58300,"I wore it once, took it off and the next time I went to put it on the chain extender was broken off.",58300,3
58300,"I can fix it, but wish I didn't have to.",58300,3
58301,thought it included a shoulder strap case as shown in the picture  - it did not!,58301,3
58302,I would say the bikini was okay.,58302,3
58302,It's more for smaller women.,58302,3
58302,I kinda wide so I have a larger frame and the seem broke on the bottoms because my butt was too big for them the top fit perfect but the bottoms didn't.,58302,3
58302,I would order a size up and if you have a smaller frame this could work for you,58302,3
58303,Christmas gift so has not been opened or used but it is her size so I hope it fits,58303,3
58304,Cute color and if you are not busty - this will look marvelous on you.,58304,3
58304,The cups were too small for me but that happens a lot with swim suits that I buy.,58304,3
58304,I'm returning it but if the top fit - I would keep it.,58304,3
58305,The color did not translate well in real life.,58305,3
58305,Also was much smaller than expected!,58305,3
58305,I was hoping to use it as an overnight bag but it's far too small.,58305,3
58306,These slippers are super comfortable at first...like walking on clouds.,58306,3
58306,"After washing them, they mated on the inside making them no better than socks.",58306,3
58306,I brushed out the wool on the inside and that helped considerably but this defect takes away from their awesomeness.,58306,3
58307,I bought these due to my doctor saying compression hose were necessary this pregnancy.,58307,3
58307,I am having severe issue with circulation and varicosities from the hips down.,58307,3
58307,These don't do a much to help me.,58307,3
58307,"By early evening it hurts to walk, swelling is evident, I feel bad (from the poor circulation), and I feel like I wasted my money.",58307,3
58307,I wore them a second time while I was washing my stronger pair from Terramed because they're better than nothing.,58307,3
58307,I noticed that that were falling down and had to be readjusted multiple times.,58307,3
58307,"So, if you have significant problems with varicosities, these aren't the ones for you.",58307,3
58307,"Also, they are sheer.",58307,3
58307,You can see through them easily.,58307,3
58307,They must be worn with caution.,58307,3
58308,Its a little bigger than I expected.,58308,3
58309,"washed in cold water tumble dry/ shrunk to large size, they were 3x..in grey/ white shrunk to 2x.. good thing  I didn't use hot  !",58309,3
58311,It's a little tighter then I like it but as I lose weight it will be just fine.,58311,3
58312,The quality is great but if you have large breasts - order a large,58312,3
58313,I ordered an XXL.,58313,3
58313,I could not get it on.,58313,3
58313,The arms were very tight.,58313,3
58313,I gave it to my sister who is a size 10-12.,58313,3
58313,And it fits her perfectly.,58313,3
58313,It is a smidge wide in the arms but she said it is very soft and comfy.,58313,3
58313,She really likes it.,58313,3
58313,"It would not supprise me if the size on the modle in the pic is a L. I don't think this is a ""Womans"" size.",58313,3
58313,"I think this was ""Juniors"" size.",58313,3
58313,"I gave it 3 stars because my smaller sister, the skinny bitch, is enjoying it.",58313,3
58314,"Fabric is rough against the neck, not comfortable",58314,3
58315,Leaves black stains on my fingers.,58315,3
58315,I already soak and wash it in hot water to see if it would be less staining.,58315,3
58315,I'm going to wash it 2-3 more times just to be safe.,58315,3
58315,And the bottom part is not as wide as what the picture is showing.,58315,3
58316,"NICE, JUST AS EXPECTED",58316,3
58317,These are not as large as I expected.,58317,3
58317,I had trouble fitting a single  men's Size 11 1/2  dress shoe in.,58317,3
58317,Will not go in all the way.,58317,3
58318,"I expected pockets, and I shouldn't have.",58318,3
58318,Useless with pockets for me,58318,3
58319,I thought it was absorbent  enough to not leak.,58319,3
58319,Is a lot better than just plain underware.,58319,3
58319,Wish I had bought more.,58319,3
58320,The glasses were great but the iPhone case does not protect your phone at all,58320,3
58321,A little dissapointed as they are not as wide as pictured but I still like them.,58321,3
58322,"I don't want to repeat the shoe size is too large saga that you can read on other product reviews; I carefully went through the reviews that recommended a shoe size for the US equivalent I wear, and picked a shoe 1 size smaller that I what I normally wear and it was still loose.",58322,3
58322,Getting the shoe size right is critical for these SPDs because you are expected to twist the shoe to decouple.,58322,3
58322,"If you have a loose shoe, guess what happens?",58322,3
58322,"- you are twisting your feet sideways to decouple, but the shoe remains straight for longer and those critical seconds you are fumbling can lead you to fall down.",58322,3
58322,Here is my suggestion - take a centimeter tape and actually measure your foot at its longest point and them compare it against the Japanese sizes on the chart.,58322,3
58322,Size down to the closest match.,58322,3
58322,You are more likely to find the right size that way than relying on the US sizes.,58322,3
58322,I would have gone 2 sizes further down if I had done that.,58322,3
58323,Material is fair and shrink after two times laundry.,58323,3
58324,The directioners necklace was much bigger than shown in the picture.,58324,3
58324,I put it up to a doorknob to show the size to my friend...,58324,3
58324,It's bigger than the doorknob,58324,3
58325,"Used after abdominal surgery, a little quirky fit but good support",58325,3
58326,Clearly a knockoff (which I knew) but the moon logo is crooked and noticeable.,58326,3
58326,It's a nice little bag other than that.,58326,3
58326,The strap is a bit flimsy.,58326,3
58327,I own many pair of gold Toe navy blue socks.,58327,3
58327,It was time to get some new pairs.,58327,3
58327,These are almost exactly the same color as my Black Gold toes.,58327,3
58327,I can't tell the difference at all.,58327,3
58328,I have ordered the large size of this product before but they gradually shrank a bit in the wash.,58328,3
58328,These aren't the same fabric as before but I think that they will fit better eventually too.,58328,3
58329,It is very cute but material is pretty thin with no lining.,58329,3
58329,My daughter wears a large but the large was way too big.,58329,3
58331,I'm very small so the dress fit way too large making my body look weird.,58331,3
58331,Had to cut this into a shirt.,58331,3
58332,cute top but it does fit somewhat small,58332,3
58333,The sleeves are extremely small and make it hard to take off.,58333,3
58333,the rest of the shirt is comfortable,58333,3
58334,I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas so I can't really say yet.,58334,3
58335,Not the highest quality made product.,58335,3
58335,"bought it as a gift for a friend, that friend really enjoyed the detail and loves to wear the ear rings.",58335,3
58336,This clip has no give?,58336,3
58336,its suppose to be elastic???,58336,3
58336,"I purchased this as a shirt clip, you know; you have a shirt that's rather larger in the back and you want a more fitted look..",58336,3
58336,I hope the metal one that I'm expecting looks like the picture.,58336,3
58337,"More than ""slim fit""  Size was 2 sizes too small.",58337,3
58338,"I could get away with wearing this skirt in a dark environment, but in the light it is too thin and would need a slip (who wears a slip anymore?!).",58338,3
58338,"Also, the only style shirt that goes well with it would be a crop too or bodysuit.",58338,3
58338,You can't tuck in a shirt because it is bulky under the thin material.,58338,3
58338,Shirts that are longer look strange over the skirt because of the way it gathers.,58338,3
58339,Its a nice color.,58339,3
58340,Really Cute but poor quality.,58340,3
58340,But unraveled after first wear,58340,3
58341,Bottoms are a but small but with a bit of stretching i fit into it.,58341,3
58342,Not made for American sized people.,58342,3
58342,"I ordered a size up, and was still disappointed.",58342,3
58343,"I like the overall product, but the size is about half of what I was expecting!",58343,3
58345,Very thin and just okay.,58345,3
58346,Big neck and small arms,58346,3
58348,"This outfit is incredibly cute, but the top is small small small.",58348,3
58348,"My daughter is in the 80th percentile for height and weight, so I always order up.",58348,3
58348,"Her first birthday is around the corner, but the 18M top fits her like spray paint.",58348,3
58348,So I ordered the 24M set.,58348,3
58348,I can't tell any difference.,58348,3
58348,I've never had this happen before with any brand.,58348,3
58348,"The skirt is just the cutest, so we'll use a different shirt or onesie with it.",58348,3
58351,A little heavy and the gold is obviously painted metal.,58351,3
58351,I love the black pendants and would like to put them on something else.,58351,3
58352,Yes this product is stretchy and could look great on some bodies.,58352,3
58352,But that doesn't apply to me and my post pregnancy body and tummy.,58352,3
58352,It shows all my tummy lumps and isn't too pretty on me.,58352,3
58352,I don't know if it's worth returning but I don't like it.,58352,3
58352,"It is comfortable, stretch and not see through at all tho.",58352,3
58352,The lace up part is sown in so there's no need for you to tie anything.,58352,3
58352,It reached between my thighs and I'm 5'1 at 155 pounds.,58352,3
58353,"The top is HUUUGE and the waist narrows oddly so even though it almost fits everywhere else, I can't zip it.",58353,3
58354,"It is cute, but it looks inexpensive.",58354,3
58354,"Th leather/material is not soft to touch,.",58354,3
58354,I have paid similar price to other purses & they look and feel very fancy.,58354,3
58355,Doesn't fit true to sit.,58355,3
58355,I bought an XXL but it fit more like a XL and a L after washing.,58355,3
58357,nice shoe but too big.,58357,3
58358,Simplemente not my style!!,58358,3
58359,"Very warm and beautiful...Not really a fan of the zipper, it gets stuck too easily..",58359,3
58360,It's really baggy and I got a small.,58360,3
58360,I gotta wear another tank under it or I'll show off my titties to the work which is kind of sexy,58360,3
58361,Fabric was kinda cheaper than I anticipated even for the prize.,58361,3
58361,My Mother says she like mm,58361,3
58362,"Although I really loved the product, I am tall and thin so the large was big enough length wise, but way to much fabric on the width size.",58362,3
58362,This may be meant for a more husky individual,58362,3
58363,Loved them tank but it was 2 sizes too small.,58363,3
58363,These fit REALLY SMALL so order 2 sizes up.,58363,3
58365,"Smaller than I thought it will be, that is definitely iPhone 4 next to it, not iPhone 5 or 6...",58365,3
58365,"But besides: it's a real leather, and plenti of pockets.",58365,3
58366,"Very nice looking and it actually got here a little faster than I had expected, but the quality is pretty cheap!",58366,3
58366,Within the first few minutes of wearing it the elastic band started to unravel.,58366,3
58366,"I cut off the excess edges and had no problem with unraveling after that, but less that a week later the knot came undone!",58366,3
58366,"It was less than $1 when I purchased it, so what exactly was I expecting the quality to be!",58366,3
58367,Returning it was very easy.,58367,3
58367,Looked like what you'd expect for the price - not junk but not high end either.,58367,3
58368,The top part kept falling off in the water.,58368,3
58368,Other than that my daughter loved it.,58368,3
58368,We made some modifications to the straps on the top.,58368,3
58369,Stayed on all night.,58369,3
58369,Just fits much more snug than the picture suggests.,58369,3
58370,Bought according to size recommendations.,58370,3
58370,Ended up being to big.,58370,3
58370,Would've been great if it weren't to loose.,58370,3
58370,"If you are close to 2 different sizes on their chart, size down, in my opinion.",58370,3
58371,"The construction of the suit is decent, but the fit is definitely unflattering if you're short and have any degree of belly convexity.",58371,3
58373,It's okay I like with a pair of jeans I have that is goes good with.,58373,3
58374,The shirt itself is really good but it not fit even close to the sizes that are listed....,58374,3
58375,Got these sandles for my 19yr old daughter they are real cute ....bad thing is the string that loop in the back to lace them upward broke the second time she wore them now she can't were them anymore,58375,3
58377,"its ok , but not the same from the picture.",58377,3
58377,the cross of the middlw its very thin,58377,3
58378,not what i expected,58378,3
58379,"I love the fit, the color, the light weight fabric (perfect for spring), the way they roll up and stay up for walking through the surf, and, of course, the comfort.",58379,3
58379,"However, and this is a big however, they came smelling strongly of chemical.",58379,3
58379,"Not a big deal, I thought, since I know that some fabrics are treated with pesticide, but, after three washings they still smell strongly of chemical.",58379,3
58379,This was not the case with the bootcut indigo Pajamajeans that I ordered previously.,58379,3
58379,"I hope that this was just a fluke with this one pair, because I would like to go on ordering this product, but not if they are going to hang onto this smell!",58379,3
58380,The pants are ok but the top is super large.,58380,3
58381,I order the dress 2 sizes bigger than what I normally wear just because I knew it ran small.,58381,3
58381,"When I got it, it still was WAY TO SMALL.",58381,3
58381,Doesn't fit well if you are a busty girl like me.,58381,3
58382,"LOVED these, but they completely unraveled and bound my laundry into one huge knot once I washed them.",58382,3
58382,I guess just treat them very delicately and hand wash.,58382,3
58386,I like them a lot,58386,3
58387,Very cheaply made but is very cute on,58387,3
58388,I purchased this item in 6mm Red Agate Jade and it is a different shade than what is pictured.,58388,3
58388,"I was expecting more a fire engine red color, whereas this is definitely darker and leaning towards the rust colored side.",58388,3
58388,"I was hoping to buy more of these in several other colors, but I may I'll hold off.",58388,3
58388,"Other than the color, it's a very nice bracelet.",58388,3
58388,"It's a good average size, wasn't hard to get over my hands, and comes with an extra cord, should you accidentally break it.",58388,3
58388,I thought that last feature was very smart thinking.,58388,3
58389,I ordered XL so that they would be roomy but are very tight.,58389,3
58390,It's not as tight as I would like it to be ill just stick to the latex waist trainers,58390,3
58391,I ended up returning this item; leaving feedback to help others figure out sizing.,58391,3
58391,My bra size is 34H and I purchased the XXXL.,58391,3
58391,"The cups fit fine, however the band was WAY too large.",58391,3
58391,I'd assumed that the measurements given in the product description were for the bust; it seems they are for the underbust.,58391,3
58391,"Unfortunately for me, since the cups on this one were the right size, anything smaller would probably not work either.",58391,3
58391,Overall it seems like it'd be comfortable if it fit properly.,58391,3
58391,If the band were more adjustable I would have kept it!,58391,3
58392,Way way way to small.....the large is like a xs/ small and the xl is like a Small/medium.....very adorable skirt just made extremely small.,58392,3
58393,I ordered the same shirt in multiple sizes and got 2 different shirts..,58393,3
58393,The material and shrinkage was different.,58393,3
58393,I got them for a group to all dress the same and they are slightly different.,58393,3
58393,"Other than that, they are fine.",58393,3
58394,The top was too small and the color was NOT what I expected but the material seems pretty good tho!,58394,3
58396,It's a fanny pack.,58396,3
58396,It's not at all a covert or discreet money belt (which is what I was really looking for).,58396,3
58396,"As for the RFID protection, I'm skeptical.",58396,3
58396,"The fanny pack comes with a one-sided sewn-in foil panel, on one of the pockets, but nothing else.",58396,3
58396,"In other words, there's a shield of some sort on one side, but not on another, and it's only for one of the pockets.",58396,3
58397,"I like the shirt a lot, the only problem is it fits a little snug on the arms and across the chest.",58397,3
58397,I use it for when I am out biking and also for exercising.,58397,3
58397,The price was right for this product.,58397,3
58398,Sunglasses do not fit the same way the Wayfarers do.,58398,3
58399,Good for several Holloweens,58399,3
58401,Waistband is very tight for a large.,58401,3
58401,I can add a piece of elastic to make it more comfortable.,58401,3
58401,Otherwise it is a lovely skirt,58401,3
58402,"Great idea, too delicate and keep breaking.",58402,3
58406,Do not look like the picture.,58406,3
58406,It have more of a rusty look!,58406,3
58407,Doesn't feel great and is hard to work with.,58407,3
58408,"Really adorable, but the size is for new born only.",58408,3
58408,My three month old son was way too big for this.,58408,3
58409,"It is a pretty head cover, just not quite the look I anticipated.",58409,3
58410,the bottom is larger than expected.,58410,3
58410,wish could  choose different size for top and bottom,58410,3
58411,I expected something very tight,58411,3
58412,I wish the bottom was a full brief but other than that I like the suit..,58412,3
58413,"It's a cute style, but it was itchy.",58413,3
58413,"It would be ok with a long sleeve shirt underneath, but that would be too hot for me.",58413,3
58413,"Returned it with no problems, love free returns, so helpful!",58413,3
58414,"The fabric was a lovely color, and it was very soft.",58414,3
58414,"But geeze, talk about NO boobie room!",58414,3
58414,I got a large and i think maybe if i had a B cup they MIGHT have squeezed in.,58414,3
58415,Cute pattern but small and flimsy.,58415,3
58417,I really love the  look of this necklace.,58417,3
58417,"It's really quite large and the goldtone is really vivid, which absolutely works for me.",58417,3
58417,"However, it did arrive broken.",58417,3
58417,"I was able to fix a link which came apart and re-attach one of the small stones  which fell out, but the necklace still doesn't look quite right, it seems off kilter -- there's nothing more I can do about it.",58417,3
58417,"I did however, like the look of it so much that I took a chance and ordered another one which  isn't here yet, and I'm hoping that the second one will arrive with no  flaws.",58417,3
58417,Crossing my fingers that it is okay.,58417,3
58417,"Update : the other  necklace I ordered has arrived,  and this one was in good shape, no flaws but lets face it, you shouldn't have to reorder another one to get what you expected the first time around.",58417,3
58417,"This however is a great looking necklace -really big, shiny and bold - love it...",58417,3
58418,"My granddaughter has not worn it,  she is 13 yrs old.",58418,3
58419,This ring is somewhat as described although I wasn't expecting it to be so incredibly small.,58419,3
58419,I bought it for a friend for her birthday because aquamarine is her birthstone however I had to really look close to see that there was a color to this stone.,58419,3
58419,It looks like a clear cubic zirconia at first and I also needed to examine it closely to make out the fact that it was a Cladagh ring.,58419,3
58419,The hands are tiny.,58419,3
58419,I almost didn't give my friend the gift out of embarrassment but was pressed for time so instead put it in a gift bag with a few other items that I knew she would like and presented it to her with an apology.,58419,3
58419,This ring would be ok for a child or a tween.,58419,3
58419,I don't reccomend it for any one older than that.,58419,3
58420,Fits weird in the chest.,58420,3
58420,cute with a sweater over it.,58420,3
58422,The fabric is quite scratchy.,58422,3
58422,I had a bamboo one with my first pregnancy which was very soft.,58422,3
58422,But this one is $20 cheaper.,58422,3
58422,I assume that's why.,58422,3
58422,I'm adjusting to the feel but don't want my baby rubbing up against the band while I nurse because it is really rough.,58422,3
58422,I'm hopeful it will work as well as my bamboo one.,58422,3
58423,only 3 bc dress tooo short but fit good overall,58423,3
58424,"It was exactly what I was looking for, and I couldn't zip it.",58424,3
58425,Wierd ..Falls around your shoulders funny.,58425,3
58425,I wore a sports bra and the opening in the front,58425,3
58426,Jacket looks great and quality feels good.,58426,3
58426,Just way too small for sizing accuracy.,58426,3
58426,I went up at least a full size and it fit about two sizes to small.,58426,3
58427,Came in different pink,58427,3
58428,Dress pictured is NOT the one received...the neckline is different and the sleeves are 3/4 instead of full length as pictured.,58428,3
58428,It's a cute dress and I think I'm keeping it but unfortunately I can't wear it for the performance I purchased it for because the sleeves are not full length.,58428,3
58428,They really should show an accurate picture of the dress.,58428,3
58429,It's very cute but it's way too small for books or anything besides a notebook !,58429,3
58430,The shirt was pretty however the sleeves were very tight and the picture looks like it is loose at the bottom almost like a piko shirt but it's not.,58430,3
58431,Daughter seems to like these and lots of color choices,58431,3
58432,Beautiful dress but runs small,58432,3
58433,"My wife doesnt like the fabric, she says it fits okay..",58433,3
58434,My daughter wanted these rings.,58434,3
58434,"They are cute, but very cheaply made.",58434,3
58434,"One of the rings arrived broken, and I had to re-attach one of the feathers.",58434,3
58434,"They are inexpensive, and you do get what you pay for.",58434,3
58434,"With that said, they are okay for a kid, my daughter loves them.",58434,3
58435,Doesn't quite look like the picture,58435,3
58436,Like it was a good cost for the quality and quantity,58436,3
58437,"I thought the look cheap,  need to return them .",58437,3
58438,The pants are held up with buttons.,58438,3
58438,This is kinda cute but the buttons click when you walk.,58438,3
58438,I ended up releasing the pants to their full length and removing the buttons.. now I am pleased with them.,58438,3
58438,The pockets are great!,58438,3
58438,(I just end up stuffing too much in them!!),58438,3
58439,The ends fall off easily,58439,3
58440,"The tank feels like it will be too small, but it stretches A LOT.",58440,3
58440,"The front part shows a lot of cleavage though, so if you were looking for something modest to wear with a cardigan this isn't it.",58440,3
58440,I wear this under my regular sweaters so I can easily lift my shirt without showing my torso.,58440,3
58441,"This really was a beautiful dress - but the color was off, which is why it only gets 3 stars.",58441,3
58441,"While I expected it to be the light, robin-egg blue in the photo, it was mint green.",58441,3
58441,"Still beautiful, and will still wear, but I was hoping for that blue.",58441,3
58442,This swimsuit is okay.,58442,3
58442,"It's not the best quality, however, it isn't too cheap.",58442,3
58442,You can get away with wearing this swimsuit with a cute cover up.,58442,3
58442,"Sidenote: The top is just a long piece of cloth, so you must be creative and know how to tie it properly to achieve the look in the picture.",58442,3
58442,"It will work for my trip, however, I probably won't be ordering again.",58442,3
58442,I received it earlier than my expected date.,58442,3
58443,Pants are much longer than the size chart stated.,58443,3
58443,The quality of the materials are cheap.,58443,3
58443,I'm scared to wash it to be honest.,58443,3
58443,The Santa face is out of ribbon and the sides are already fraying.,58443,3
58444,"Seems like a nice coat, fit is good but it but it seemed really larger overall (way too big and I usually wear an XL coat).",58444,3
58444,Not as soft as I thought it'd be but that's not to say it's bad or anything.,58444,3
58444,"The only thing that killed it for me is having to return it the shipping, just throwing away $30+ to send it back leaves a bad taste in the mouth so order down so you get the right size and don't have to do the same.",58444,3
58445,I liked the shirt okay but it's not the color I thought it would be AT ALL.,58445,3
58445,In the picture it looks like a more heather gray but it is actually a dark gray.,58445,3
58445,It's still pretty cute though and fits pretty good too.,58445,3
58446,Shoes size as expected.,58446,3
58446,Arrived sooner then thought.,58446,3
58447,This top is not nearly as long as it looks on the model.,58447,3
58447,It comes to just below my hips and fits like a standard cami (only about an inch longer).,58447,3
58447,"It works, but a regular cami can be picked up just about anywhere.",58447,3
58447,Not tunic length - not even close.,58447,3
58448,It's good quality but the fit is small.,58448,3
58449,I ordered a large and had to give this to my mother law who wears a small.,58449,3
58450,Ordered a size up and they are too big.,58450,3
58450,The fit and fabric isn't the greatest.,58450,3
58451,These fit a little smaller than others.,58451,3
58451,The white washes nicely but the lacy linings my daughter finds itchy and they've started to unravel after just a few wears and washes.,58451,3
58452,It is super cute and comfortable but I am 5'10'' and I ordered a L and it was way way way too short.,58452,3
58452,I wouldn't suggest it for anyone over 5'8'',58452,3
58453,"Plenty wide, just too short.",58453,3
58453,Tool box was excellent with their refund.,58453,3
58454,"It works for what I want but I'm not really happy with the quality of the ""silver"" finish.",58454,3
58455,This is a great shaper but not great for a long torso or lower belly fat,58455,3
58456,Blue color is absolutely stunning.,58456,3
58456,"Sadly, I could not make this shirt work.",58456,3
58456,"Ordered twice, trying to find the right fit.",58456,3
58456,"2X finally fit around the waist, but then looked ridiculously large on top.",58456,3
58456,Really wanted it to work.,58456,3
58456,"Based on my measurements, I think this is probably best on a large busted but thin woman.",58456,3
58457,Runs a little big,58457,3
58458,Its ok for a party.,58458,3
58458,Batteries last long enough for at least 4 hours.,58458,3
58458,"Quality is very poor, no ergonomics at all.",58458,3
58458,"The electrical connections are very handmade, I even had to disassemble one shoe to fix it the first night we got them because it was not plugged and was rusted.",58458,3
58459,"It's a nice item but you can't read the writing on it, Even if held inches from your face",58459,3
58461,"Love the suit, 3 stars because the bottoms are really small for what they are labeled.",58461,3
58461,I ordered a L and the top fits great but the bottoms are tight.,58461,3
58461,Also the top had uneven lengths in the two straps that tie around your mid section.,58461,3
58461,"When it was all on and tied, the bow was extremely uneven with a huge loop and a small one.",58461,3
58461,"I ended up untaveling the whole top, laid out the two straps evenly, and cut the long one to match the other.",58461,3
58461,After that everything was great!,58461,3
58462,Do not feel these held up to what was described and run very small.,58462,3
58463,Wish the length was a tad longer but it still fits.,58463,3
58463,"The color however for the burgundy was much brighter in person than the photo shows, but I still love the dress",58463,3
58466,The glasses keep falling off my nose,58466,3
58467,"It's a pretty decent looking top I usually wear a small but ordered a medium and it fit as I wanted it to, however there is a hole.",58467,3
58468,It was pretty but I got a large and the zipper stripped on me.,58468,3
58468,They were out of larges so I got a XL and the top was different than the large.,58468,3
58468,It was whiter than the large in the top part,58468,3
58469,Its a nice sweater but in order for it to fit like the picture youd have to be built small.,58469,3
58469,But its still nice.,58469,3
58470,My girls love love their mermaids.,58470,3
58470,I think it is a little pricey for what you get but it is a lot of fun seeing them swim in them.,58470,3
58471,The positive reviews and pics of others in the suit are what made my decision to order this suit.,58471,3
58471,"While it looks great on everyone else, on me it gives me the mom jeans look.",58471,3
58471,"Fit was as expected, straps kept popping off.",58471,3
58472,I am a 16-18 and ordered that size and it is true to the fit.,58472,3
58472,It is very pretty and for the price it is hard to beat.,58472,3
58472,But is is not a waist trainer for me.,58472,3
58472,I have a collection of really cheep and really expensive corsets.,58472,3
58472,At $25 this is a very inexpensive corset.,58472,3
58472,The steel boned wires are not very sturdy and it is only one layer of material.,58472,3
58472,"That said, it is a cute corset and perfect for a day at the pirate festival.",58472,3
58473,"It's cute and it looks good, but the straps come undone ALL THE TIME.",58473,3
58473,"Also, I thought I ordered the all white, but I got white/ black instead.",58473,3
58475,"Has a weird material, but fit good.",58475,3
58475,Not what I'd usually wear but decided to try something new.,58475,3
58475,Doesn't look the best on me but oh well.,58475,3
58476,Ok for what I needed.,58476,3
58477,"It's cute, but now that I have had the wallet for a while, it doesn't want to close quite as well as it used to.",58477,3
58477,I'm assuming that carrying it in my purse led to it getting smushed somehow.,58477,3
58479,Something about the glass compositions that I got headache wearing it for few hours!,58479,3
58479,I guess it's the chePer price so less quality glasses?,58479,3
58481,I liked them a lot but only 3 stars since there was no zipper.,58481,3
58481,Otherwise they are great.,58481,3
58482,The smaller pocket zipper gets stuck constantly.,58482,3
58482,"The back pack is cool looking and different than what's out there, but the dimensions of the little pocket aren't compatible with the space needed for the zipper to close.",58482,3
58483,Color not a pictured.,58483,3
58483,Get a smaller size than normal.,58483,3
58484,I like the size but I wish the zippers actually had pockets behind them- totally faux.,58484,3
58484,On top of that- This purse smells terrible!,58484,3
58486,The skirt is comfortable and soft with a good length which makes a great silhouette.,58486,3
58486,"Unfortunately, I was confused by the color.",58486,3
58486,Purple looks burgundy and vice versa.,58486,3
58486,I went against my better judgment and purchased burgundy hoping for the purple one.,58486,3
58486,It was a $20 bet and I lost this one.,58486,3
58487,"Well, it definitely looks better in the picture.",58487,3
58487,It almost looks like it should be part of a costume.,58487,3
58487,"The pink color was pretty, but it really is poor quality.",58487,3
58487,"I would have rated it lower, but I really only paid a few bucks for it anyway.",58487,3
58487,You can't expect much.,58487,3
58488,Ended up being way too small.,58488,3
58489,"I ordered this for big girls, but the sizing is for little kids, especially the gloves.",58489,3
58489,This is for 5-6  years old and it should specifically state not for big girls.,58489,3
58490,"Quality was nice; however, the size chart was way off.",58490,3
58490,Ordered for my son's prom and he was unable to wear it!,58490,3
58490,"He usually wears a mens medium and according to the size chart that is what should have been ordered, but way too big!",58490,3
58491,"This was not what I ordered, but its OK.",58491,3
58492,Small ones do not hold.,58492,3
58492,"On most I had to ""fix"" them by flattening the blade so it would not just spin.",58492,3
58492,"Save your money, and buy the real thing.",58492,3
58492,These will frustrate you!,58492,3
58493,I love the fit it does hold you in.,58493,3
58493,my only complaint is the small I was it and can not get the odor out,58493,3
58495,I ordered two in different colors.,58495,3
58495,The dark blue one came out as the picture described and fits perfectly!,58495,3
58495,The white one on the other hand definitely had some problems.,58495,3
58495,The shoulder and chest area were stitched together  silly manufacturing mistake.,58495,3
58495,Something I can carefully cut apart but I mean come on really?,58495,3
58495,Overall cute but would have gotten more stars if both came properly seen together.,58495,3
58496,Love the print on this tee.,58496,3
58496,I get a lot of compliments on the design.,58496,3
58496,I'm not thrilled with the quality of the tee as it's pilling (getting little fabric balls) across the front after a few washes and wears.,58496,3
58497,"The snake chain felt cheap, but it is a cheap set.",58497,3
58497,Returned and got a Pandora set up.,58497,3
58498,Looks nicer in photo.,58498,3
58498,It is still a nice necklace.,58498,3
58499,Gave it to my guy friend for XMAS in front of his parents!!,58499,3
58501,"Top is very cute, but the bottoms were small for the size.",58501,3
58501,This is not an easy suit to swim in.,58501,3
58502,"I am 5'4"", 122 lbs, and was looking for something loose and long to wear with leggings.",58502,3
58502,The fabric of this sweater is very soft and the design is cute.,58502,3
58502,"Unfortunately, it is extra wide across the chest/torso, of average length (not close to covering my butt), and has fairly tight sleeves (especially around the forearm).",58502,3
58502,"Due to the awkward fit, I am returning it.",58502,3
58503,It is a beautiful set and the color is fantastic  but all the stones fell out.,58503,3
58504,This has elastic on the ends of the sleeves that is way too tight and makes the shirt uncomfortable.,58504,3
58504,Otherwise it looks good and fits well.,58504,3
58505,Ordered and thought I was getting the colors pictured - totally didn't.,58505,3
58505,Fit fine but was looking for more muted colors.,58505,3
58506,These looked nice and I would've kept them had my favorite one not been missing the pin upon arrival.,58506,3
58506,"That made me question the quality, so I chose to return them instead of exchange for a new set.",58506,3
58507,I wear a small but ordered a medium.,58507,3
58507,Not the  color I ordered.,58507,3
58508,I had to replace this dress with somehing i bought that didn't fit right.,58508,3
58508,I just tried it on & it fits perfectly!,58508,3
58508,"It is thinner than expected but other than that, its a nice dress.",58508,3
58508,Cant wait to wear it out,58508,3
58509,"I was incredibly excited to try on this swimsuit; absolutely loved the color, loved the style, and once I got it loved how good the quality was.",58509,3
58509,Only bit I didn't love was the size.,58509,3
58509,I ordered a large when they still had it and got probably a medium.,58509,3
58509,"I'm a 36C, what I got was a 36B.",58509,3
58509,"Now the blue is unavailable, so I'm a little disappointed, but I'll get over it and pick another color if they don't sell out again.",58509,3
58509,"Overall, everything was perfect and just as described and pictured, so stars for that.",58509,3
58509,I just drew the short end of the stick and ended up in the 40% Runs small group.,58509,3
58514,Well made product but don't fit well at all...they sit way high on the eyes.,58514,3
58514,The only way they sit well is if you put them on the end of your nose.,58514,3
58514,So they may fit some well but not I.,58514,3
58515,"It was very nice I loved it,but its was way to large for my grandson.",58515,3
58516,"I love the look of this dress, and I actually wear it as a long shirt with a sweater, too cute!",58516,3
58516,"Only thing I don't like about it, it's poorly made.",58516,3
58516,Fabric and strings were hanging out and looked like it was falling apart when I received it.,58516,3
58516,I didn't feel the need to return it because it was cheap AND was brought over from China or something like that.,58516,3
58516,"So, I knew returning it would most likely be challenging.",58516,3
58517,Cute dress in the picture.,58517,3
58517,Not very good quality.,58517,3
58518,These were great at first and were a HUGE hit with my son who is 6 and has a dream of becoming a Pokemon master when he grows up.lol.,58518,3
58518,However the backs of the pins won't stay on.,58518,3
58518,So they won't stay on the black insert.,58518,3
58519,The cups are a little small and have no support but over all the lace is nice for the price.,58519,3
58519,I am a 34C and got a small,58519,3
58521,"These sunglasses do what they need to, but they are kind of bulky.",58521,3
58522,"Kinda thin, but cute.",58522,3
58522,Don't forget to get some tape to lift of the girls,58522,3
58523,"Good quality, cheap price, very cute, runs very small, and does NOT fit you if you're tall ladies!!",58523,3
58523,"I'm 5' 9"" and it doesn't fit length wise as well as runs small",58523,3
58524,Good but little bit larger for my kid.,58524,3
58527,"it was a nice suit, nothing really wrong with it, however it fit quite small, wife returned it.",58527,3
58528,This skirt was just ok.,58528,3
58528,"It fit ok but I was looking for a coral color, and it was definitely just pink.",58528,3
58528,"It was a little shorter than I would consider midi, more like knee length.",58528,3
58528,I sent it back because it wasn't what I was looking for.,58528,3
58529,I read all reviews took my measurements and ordered this.,58529,3
58529,Took it out of package and hair just exploded everwhere.,58529,3
58529,"From previous reviews I knew it shed, but holy moly..ha.",58529,3
58529,"The dress is thin and a bit too big, no biggie I knew that and plan to wear a belt with it.",58529,3
58529,They are not stretchy at all.,58529,3
58529,"I'm smaller than a 16x( package says fits 16x-24), but I can not get them up all the way.they are way too short.",58529,3
58529,Says model on package is 5'8 but I am 5'5 and they don't even cover my butt.,58529,3
58529,Going to try another reviewers tip of cutting off toes.,58529,3
58529,"The ears are sewn on differently, 1 on top and 1 half on side which then lays flat..so will need to add a few stitches or something to try and get it to stand.",58529,3
58529,Overall it will work but I'm going to have to make a few alterations and hope for the best.,58529,3
58530,"Nice , fit as expected but the grey short is different from the others..",58530,3
58530,It has no side phone pocket...,58530,3
58531,"Its just ok, quality is lacking a little.",58531,3
58531,"cross is nice, but beads are rough and chain is junky.",58531,3
58533,"The fabric did not look the same as the models was wearing, false advertisement.",58533,3
58534,"Very cute shirt, however, smaller and shorter than expected.",58534,3
58534,I would order one to two sizes larger than you usually wear.,58534,3
58535,But not the best.,58535,3
58536,It's a nice size and has a nice weight to it.,58536,3
58536,It's a cheap item and that being said it's crafted very cheap.,58536,3
58536,"It was received with glue stuck to the image making it foggy, I popped the front glass off, pulled out the paper image and scraped off the glue.",58536,3
58536,"Once I cleaned it all up I glued it back together and it's not perfect, but it's about the quality I expected for $4.00.",58536,3
58537,"Looks beautiful, fabric is beautiful and flowy but so disappointed the XL fits more like a medium.",58537,3
58538,"so i took a large for my friend, and the large fit me.",58538,3
58538,"I normally wear a small, it runs small even though the material is spandex n suppose to stretch, it is small.",58538,3
58539,Very cute but it was too small and I have to have it sized even though I ordered my correct size it fits very small compared to my other ring in the same size.,58539,3
58539,Also the way it's set creates a snaging issue with some fabrics.,58539,3
58540,The print was a little small the picture makes it look bigger.,58540,3
58540,I'm still keeping it but that's my only complain.,58540,3
58540,The color and  material is great.,58540,3
58543,Its a nice color and fits as expected but the fabric is very stiff and itchy.,58543,3
58543,"Maybe after I wash it, it will relax some and be more comfortable.",58543,3
58544,"The sleeves are too short for me (I'm 5'8""), and they were very loose.",58544,3
58544,"Body is fitted, and the Large fit perfectly everywhere but the arms.",58544,3
58544,Giving it to a friend since I hate returning things in general.,58544,3
58545,Size was a bit small and material or fabric used is not strong.,58545,3
58546,A little longer than my original brolly bought in Brooklyn.,58546,3
58546,So not handbag friendly.,58546,3
58547,Color isn't even close to what's pictured.,58547,3
58547,Kept because I had to pay return shipping.,58547,3
58548,"I ordered a Large, the bottom fit fine but the top was CLEARLY made for a tiny girl.",58548,3
58548,I am a 34 DD the top is not made for well endowed women Lol.,58548,3
58548,I paired the bottom with a different top though and the outfit was still cute.,58548,3
58549,The skirt is see through.,58549,3
58549,I didn't realize that so I had to return it.,58549,3
58550,I'm still debating on returning this item.,58550,3
58550,Not very impressed with it.,58550,3
58550,I'm not sure if I was expecting more from all the high reviews but I can say I was disappointed.,58550,3
58550,The bra does not look like in the picture.,58550,3
58550,You can tell the whole outfit was cheaply made.,58550,3
58550,The bra hook does not hook properly.,58550,3
58550,The fabric was sewed to close together making it impossible to latch.,58550,3
58550,My boyfriend could not even do it.,58550,3
58550,The bra does not really fit correctly either.,58550,3
58550,"It is too big, I am a 32 B.",58550,3
58550,"It sits a bit awkward, It covers my nipples and thats about it, a bathing suit top would have done better, and is cheaper.",58550,3
58550,I wish I saved my money.,58550,3
58550,"I'm 5 ft 3 in
145lbs
32 B
Hope this helps some of you.",58550,3
58551,"I cannot say exactly what Daughter didn't like about these, but she doesn't wear them anymore.",58551,3
58552,it is  some what small but I like it,58552,3
58553,more like lingerie and not a dress... comes with red thong that doesn't do anything except cover a small triangle in the front.,58553,3
58554,"Yes I get that it's called a bralette, but the picture makes it look more like a crop top.",58554,3
58554,Maybe on a petite person it would be.,58554,3
58554,"But on me, it's pretty much a bra so I can't wear it alone.",58554,3
58554,I wear it under sheer shirts.,58554,3
58555,I was happy with the dress.,58555,3
58556,I have been using these shoes and pedals for a couple years on my road and mountain bike.,58556,3
58556,I have ridden over one thousand miles in them this year.,58556,3
58556,The only fit issue i have is even tight the design of the shoe could hold more solidly on my foot.,58556,3
58556,They have been overall good until a buckle broke just recently.,58556,3
58556,"The shoes are still usable, just inconvenient to tighten the top strap.",58556,3
58556,I have had zero problems with the pedals.,58556,3
58557,Will have to do some alteration as it is wider than I expected but looks as pictured,58557,3
58558,"Really like it but after only a few washes the ""paint"" or decal or whatever has been chipping away.",58558,3
58559,I don't have small nipples bit these weren't as cute as expected....a little longer and wider than expected,58559,3
58560,Didn't really like it because of the material so I gave it away to someone who would wear it,58560,3
58561,"The design is really pretty, but the bust is TINY!",58561,3
58561,I ordered a medium and am 34DD at 19 weeks and I could not get my boobs to fit in the top!,58561,3
58563,"tight in arms for an xl, i have bought other items origniatting in Asia and they have fit appropriately.",58563,3
58564,It's a little tight around my boob area.,58564,3
58565,OK so the description it specifically says low rise but these are high waisted.,58565,3
58565,I do not like high waisted things they make me look fat.,58565,3
58565,"Other than that they're nice, the material is a lot more substantial than I expected, definitely more jeans like then I expected.",58565,3
58565,They are comfortable but it still feels like you're wearing jeans not leggings.,58565,3
58565,They are nice deep dark blue color and the rips are nicely placed.,58565,3
58565,"I am 5'5"" 138lbs.",58565,3
58565,"usually size 8 and I got a size 11 in these cuz I like things to be comfortable, they fit perfectly for me but for some of you might want them tighter.",58565,3
58566,Fabric is quite thin.,58566,3
58567,Ordered the 3xl and it appeared to fit someone who would typically wear a med-large.,58567,3
58567,Product appears to work well if proper size is ordered.,58567,3
58567,Unfortunately they don't have bigger.,58567,3
58567,I typically wear a size 18 jeans and the 3xl was a disappointment.,58567,3
58568,A little snug but still looked rad,58568,3
58569,Good for this price,58569,3
58570,Purchased 3T - it fit a 2T.,58570,3
58570,Otherwise - Very cute,58570,3
58571,"It's a cute bathing suit and a great price, but runs extremely small.",58571,3
58571,I would order another one in a medium.,58571,3
58571,"I'm disappointed, because I wanted to wear this on my vacation.",58571,3
58571,Sizing chart isn't correct.,58571,3
58571,If you normally wear a small order a medium in this one.,58571,3
58571,If you're extra small order a small.,58571,3
58571,Extra small might fit your child.,58571,3
58572,The size sent was not size ordered.,58572,3
58572,The quality of this product fits the price..Not worth sending back or reordering.,58572,3
58573,The sock is to small.,58573,3
58574,I tried to return this crocheted top because the hem was sewn on the outside *(bottom & sleeves).,58574,3
58574,If I  turned it inside out then the seams were on the outside.,58574,3
58574,It was just put together wrong.,58574,3
58574,I  don't think my return reason made sense.,58574,3
58574,Maybe it doesn't now.,58574,3
58576,Its has too small of a space for a septum and too tight of a fit for the bead.,58576,3
58576,"Other than that, its very gorgeous",58576,3
58577,"When I got the earrings, they were falling  out of a ripped piece of foam that was SUPPOSED to hold them but definitely didn't.",58577,3
58577,All of the tiny rubber backs were off the earrings and in the bag.,58577,3
58577,I overlooked that but I was very disappointed that the earrings sent were the wrong size.,58577,3
58577,I ordered 1.4 mm but got 6 mm earrings that were pretty big.,58577,3
58577,I am trying to return them and the company is luckily being kind about it (which is good).,58577,3
58577,The earrings were pretty cute and I would buy again (if I get the right size),58577,3
58578,If you are looking for something cheap in a pinch ...,58578,3
58578,"They do the job .... Quality wise, not great ...",58578,3
58578,I would call these a one to two time wear ...,58578,3
58578,Very much a cheap disposable item.,58578,3
58578,More of a sheer tight rather than a legging.,58578,3
58579,It ran small for my wife.,58579,3
58579,She said if she had a smaller bust it would have fit as pictured.,58579,3
58580,"i ordered a large, got a small.",58580,3
58580,"im not returning them
because its cold outside and i need some of these but otherwise i would return them.",58580,3
58582,Super cute but terribly overpriced for what it is.,58582,3
58582,I get tons of compliments on it but even with an ice pack it does not really stay cold for that long.,58582,3
58583,Too tight across the back.,58583,3
58583,"I'm 5'3"" and weigh 140 (I workout everyday) and found since there is no stretch it wasn't a good workout shirt.",58583,3
58583,I got a large.,58583,3
58584,This is a really cute suit and surprisingly good quality for the price.,58584,3
58584,I ordered it just to check it out.,58584,3
58584,I wear a small or medium in Victoria Secret and I ordered a large in this suit.,58584,3
58584,"I am 5'7, 130 and the problem with this suit is that it too short; it barely covered my breasts and came down very low.",58584,3
58584,Too bad because it's a nice suit.,58584,3
58586,I ordered up a size but it was still too small.,58586,3
58588,They slide off easily,58588,3
58589,Really like the material and quality of this dress.,58589,3
58589,I followed the measurements/size chart.,58589,3
58589,Bought my size accordingly and it runs two sizes too small.,58589,3
58589,It is also way too short.,58589,3
58589,Not a dress on my 5'7' svelte frame - not even tunic length on me.,58589,3
58589,"Sadly, I will be returning.",58589,3
58591,The pockets are odd and don't flow well with the shirt.,58591,3
58592,"These fit well, but they tore on the seams the first time I wore them.",58592,3
58592,"Great product otherwise, they just need to be sewn together with stronger thread.",58592,3
58593,Ok. Make sure you get larger size than your normal.,58593,3
58594,"Not so comfy, but good for the price",58594,3
58595,Didn't look like the picture,58595,3
58596,"Its was way too large for me, I ended up giving it to a friend that could use it.",58596,3
58597,I was really excited about the price and online reviews.,58597,3
58597,"Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
 -Pretty much looks like the photo.",58597,3
58597,-Fairly thick material so you don't need to wear something underneath.,58597,3
58597,-Long enough (if you're not that tall - I'm 5'2 and it came to just above my knees.,58597,3
58597,"Cons:
-If you have hips and are curvy, this is not a flattering look - beware!",58597,3
58597,"-Its a little low in the front - not terribly low, but lower than I like to wear (I don't like to show cleavage).",58597,3
58597,"With that said, it has buttons, but if you try to button the the higher ones (which aren't supposed to be buttoned), it bunches up on the sleeves.",58597,3
58597,"I'll be returning this because it just doesn't suit my body type, but its a great deal!",58597,3
58598,The dress is cute but the material is paper thin.,58598,3
58598,A size 6 was form-fitting on me and a little bit short.,58598,3
58598,"I'm 5'2"" and a pre-pregnancy size 2 for reference.",58598,3
58598,It's just too short for work.,58598,3
58599,Ok ... Nice for sleeping in can be thin ..,58599,3
58601,"I ordered this dress knowing it would be short, but even still this thing could have been worn as a shirt on me!",58601,3
58602,Small size for petit woman is way too tight specially for top.,58602,3
58602,Better to order one more size,58602,3
58604,"The item itself is Okay, but it runs very, very small.",58604,3
58604,I wear a size US12 and this belt could not go around my waist.,58604,3
58604,"Also, returning may be a hassle as this vendor is from china.",58604,3
58604,I ended up keeping the items (will give to someone) and negotiated a partial refund.,58604,3
58605,"This is a nice enough case, but it's on the small side.",58605,3
58605,"Doesn't accommodate a 36C bra without crushing it, which kind of defeats the purpose.",58605,3
58605,Might be OK for a 32A or B.,58605,3
58607,"Super cool and my 3 year old loves them, but the heel sits low and slips off easily.",58607,3
58607,The coolness doesn't outweigh the inability to wear them.,58607,3
58608,"It was ok for a decoration, but the shamrocks were coming unglued from the veil.",58608,3
58609,I love this dress and how its made.,58609,3
58609,I bought a large and it fit perfect except the boobs.,58609,3
58609,Mine are quite large and when zipped it smashed them down or created 3 boobs with my bra on.,58609,3
58609,I wish i still had the tags.,58609,3
58609,Long story short if you have bigger boobs go up a size,58609,3
58610,"Material is thin, but it looked fairly good on.",58610,3
58611,While its not a bad shirt at all - and for anyone who is on the slimmer side I would say its a great shirt for that price - it just didn't work for me.,58611,3
58611,"The reason being the pleats go all the way to the bottom of the shirt, this makes the shirt a little ridged and heavy when you tuck it in.",58611,3
58611,Most tux shirts have pleats only till the waist line.,58611,3
58611,"To reduce the cost they must have done this, believe or not its cheaper to put pleats on the entire shirt than just till the waist line.",58611,3
58612,"These are cute, bigger than I thought they would be.",58612,3
58612,My real issue is with the color.,58612,3
58612,"It looks like a darker grey in the picture , but what I received was a really really light silvery grey, which isn't what I wanted at all.",58612,3
58612,I've never had an issue with color representation and buying things online.,58612,3
58613,"Toddler sized....I was hoping for ""kid"" size for a 4/5 year old and they were a bit small.",58613,3
58613,Would be perfect for a toddler.,58613,3
58614,"Made my ears swell up, but what can I expect for 70 pennies!",58614,3
58615,The backs arnt made so much for kids it seems.....only after having them in a day one of them fell out and she lost it other then that loved them.,58615,3
58616,This is bigger than I was expected.,58616,3
58617,Very heavy for keys.,58617,3
58617,I ended up taking the body off and just keeping the head on my keys.,58617,3
58618,"I was expecting a skinnier leg since these are ""slim fit"" but they are comfortable and a great color.",58618,3
58619,Fits good from the hips down..  the fold over part is extremely loose and baggy.,58619,3
58620,The only part that looks like the picture are the facets.,58620,3
58620,Color is really pale,58620,3
58621,"Did not get a sticker with shipment,",58621,3
58622,Smaller than it looks !,58622,3
58623,"The outfit is very cute, however it runs small.",58623,3
58623,I ordered 18 month size for my little 13 month old and it's almost too tight.,58623,3
58624,Ok. Looks really pretty but my hair ties slip off it really easily,58624,3
58625,They were a bit higher on my waist than I expected bit they were comfortable without any riding up,58625,3
58626,"Don't really like how it feels, smells and looks.",58626,3
58626,"Is not softer enough, it feels like dog hair just the strands are soft.",58626,3
58627,Fit great but is unfortunately too short :/,58627,3
58628,Didn't like the overall fit.,58628,3
58628,Not flattering if you have bigger hips.,58628,3
58629,"The ruffle begins too high - way above the waist and it was too large, but pretty.",58629,3
58631,It's a very cute top but it did not fit as expected.,58631,3
58631,I returned it and plan to order a larger size,58631,3
58632,It's a beautiful dress.,58632,3
58632,I would recommend 2 sizes larger though.,58632,3
58632,The bust area is cut entirely too small.,58632,3
58633,Good shirt but it's not as long as it appears,58633,3
58634,Unfortunately the Jake hoodie was an Iron on image and fell off the 2 weeks after purchase no tag or washing directions so we washed by hand turned inside out and dried it on low to be careful... Perhaps we could get an new patch..,58634,3
58634,I thought it was silk screened....great shipping fit her very comfortable just needs a heads up on washing directions ...she is sad because she loved it so much....bless xx,58634,3
58635,"I normally wear a 2X, but this sweater swims on me.",58635,3
58635,That's why I'm giving it three stars.,58635,3
58635,"It's well made, otherwise.",58635,3
58636,"These men's socks are a little small - I wear size 10 and these are too small - also the first time you put them on, a lot of the elastic breaks when being dragged over your heel.",58636,3
58636,The designs are good,58636,3
58637,first I ordered a 2x and it was a little big but can be worn.,58637,3
58637,"So I then ordered<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-s-Plus-Size-T-Shirt-Perfect-With-Long-Sleeves-Henley-Neck-Dark/dp/B00VKORISC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women's Plus Size T-Shirt, Perfect, With Long Sleeves, Henley Neck Dark</a>&nbsp;a medium plus and it is a little small.",58637,3
58637,I guess I need a 1x .....I didn't see that size avail so I thought medium plus was the next size down.,58637,3
58638,"I really liked it, but needed tools to put it back together after it broke after only a few hours of wear.",58638,3
58640,I would like this necklace so much better if the eyes showed up better.,58640,3
58640,They aren't as noticeable as in the photo.,58640,3
58641,"It's cute on top if your pair is perky, but the back side is VERY short and shows a bit of ""median shadow"".",58641,3
58641,"I might be able to fix this by narrowing the front pelvic area under the sewing machine so I could yank more material towards the back, but then the side tie straps would not meet on a horizontal plane.",58641,3
58641,I'll save this one for the hot tub.,58641,3
58642,Overall the top is really cute.,58642,3
58642,It is a off black color however and not a solid black which kinda bums me out since I was planning on wearing it with a matching black skirt and it looks a little off.,58642,3
58642,It's nothing too major I can't live with though and I'm excited to wear it out!,58642,3
58643,But I almost returned it because the bandwidth of the top is too big.,58643,3
58643,I decided to improvise by just tying it in the back because the cup size was just right.,58643,3
58643,The bottoms are perfect.,58643,3
58643,Leaves neat tan lines.,58643,3
58644,Love the shirt just too small,58644,3
58645,"Cute and girlie, but my daughter was unable to wear it because it was too small.",58645,3
58645,Haven't sent it back yet.,58645,3
58646,I returned this because it was too small even after ordering a size up.,58646,3
58646,It would have been ok if the white trim allowed some stretch like the rest of the dress.,58646,3
58647,It is definitely short!,58647,3
58648,Some random separation of the knitting.,58648,3
58648,"It's alright, but we decided to return it.",58648,3
58649,I'm giving this a 3 due to the description stating that this is cotton.,58649,3
58649,This is not cotton but a thin see through cotton spandex material (feels very close to what a bathing suit is made of).,58649,3
58649,The sizing was a bit off as well and not very forgiving in the middle.,58649,3
58649,This could be a cute top for someone on the very slim side that understands that an undershirt would be needed to wear this.,58649,3
58650,In my opinion they are for children not an adult.,58650,3
58650,Very plastic looking and I will give mine away as gifts to my female elementary students.,58650,3
58650,they will like them and be very happy.,58650,3
58651,"Cap made good,looks good ,embroidery looks nice but did have a crease above bill due to shipping",58651,3
58652,"I measured my daughter before ordering & her bust measurement was 42.5"" which according to their chart would have put her in a 17W, so that's what I ordered.",58652,3
58652,THEN they messed up the order & sent a size 16W & it was still huge.,58652,3
58652,I can only imagine how much worse it would've been if they had sent the size I ordered.,58652,3
58652,"She is a very large chested girl wearing a 36 DDD, but only wears a size 10 jeans.",58652,3
58652,"I knew her chest would be the hardest part to fit, so I ordered it to fit there & planned on taking it in everywhere else.",58652,3
58652,"I will make it work, because I don't have time to do any thing else.",58652,3
58652,Also as some of the other reviews mentioned the straps are way to big.,58652,3
58652,"I need to take 2"" off each strap to get it to fit correctly.",58652,3
58652,"Yes it's big elsewhere too, but I had expected that & knew I was ordering big when it came to the waist & length.",58652,3
58652,I'm just disappointed that it didn't fit the bust even at a size smaller than what I had ordered.,58652,3
58652,"For everyone's reference my daughters measurements were- Bust: 42.5"" ; waist: 35.5"" ; hips: 43"" ; hollow to floor: 54"" & the size 16W that I received was too big & not what I had ordered.",58652,3
58652,"It is a beautiful dress, it's just the sizing is way off :( Giving it 3 stars because it is well made & I can deal with it being too big.",58652,3
58652,If it was too small I wouldn't have been able to fix it.,58652,3
58653,In theory it's nice...,58653,3
58653,"But it's thin which on one hand is nice to work out in but it doesn't have a built in bra, which it really needs because that kind of ruins everything.",58653,3
58653,"It also appears to be form fitting but it's not, it's loose.",58653,3
58653,"I'm 5'3"" and 110lbs or less and I got the Small and it's OK, just not what I was after.",58653,3
58653,"That being said, the color (I got the fushia) and it's very nice and it arrived very quickly.",58653,3
58654,Very nice wallet leather is very soft.,58654,3
58654,It is an extra large and thick wallet so know what you are buying.,58654,3
58654,It's got room for everything except the cash/bills.,58654,3
58654,It's very difficult to open wallet to insert or remove bills.,58654,3
58654,"Very frustrating, bills start sticking out and could tear on zipper.",58654,3
58655,"Very short, think shirt instead of dress.",58655,3
58655,Chest fits small also.,58655,3
58655,"The material is pretty, not cheap and pretty color.",58655,3
58656,I don't like that the ring pops up.,58656,3
58656,"the bracelet part is good, but twists alot.",58656,3
58657,They are a little big on me but made from good material.,58657,3
58658,"My son loves this watch, but the pin that holds the band on fell off w/in a week",58658,3
58659,Would of rather paid $7.,58659,3
58659,It's cheap material & it's not white.,58659,3
58659,I'm thinking of sending it back.,58659,3
58660,The bra itself is gorgeous but the fit is awkward.,58660,3
58660,I'm a 34 C. The band does fit it's the cups that seems to small.,58660,3
58660,They only come about half way up my boob so I'm left with that annoying side boob.,58660,3
58660,They don't entirely reach my side either.,58660,3
58661,"As much as I love the style, I'm quite disappointed with this.",58661,3
58661,"I'll still wear it, but it's not what I was expecting.",58661,3
58661,"Pros:
- The colour was true and beautiful.",58661,3
58661,"Red is my best, and it's a confidence-booster.",58661,3
58661,- The length is just right.,58661,3
58661,It skims just past my hips.,58661,3
58661,Other reviewers don't like how short it is; I've bought mini dresses and skater dress and have worn them as a tunic when I want more length.,58661,3
58661,- Not at all sheer.,58661,3
58661,"Cons:
- The bust is entirely too large.",58661,3
58661,I'm a size 32D and couldn't fill out this tunic.,58661,3
58661,I'll have to take it in.,58661,3
58661,- The fabric is heavy.,58661,3
58661,"I like rayon, but this feels off.",58661,3
58661,And it clings horribly to my stomach.,58661,3
58661,"I'll have to wear a camisole under this to flatten it out, but I shouldn't have to.",58661,3
58661,- The sleeves are like boa constrictors.,58661,3
58661,I had to stuff the sleeves to stretch them out enough for my arms.,58661,3
58661,- The cinch is still big.,58661,3
58661,"I've tailored it, but it's and annoyance to have to do that.",58661,3
58661,"I think this is very pretty, and I'll have a lot of confidence wearing this after I finish tailoring it.",58661,3
58662,I'm 5'6 and the length seemed longer than I expected.,58662,3
58663,Longer in the legs than expected,58663,3
58664,Felt like bedsheet material.,58664,3
58664,Still trying to figure out how to wear.,58664,3
58664,It is beautiful though!,58664,3
58664,According to size chart I got a large.,58664,3
58664,I probably could have gotten away with a med.,58664,3
58665,"Fits great, bit quality is on the low side",58665,3
58666,A bit too large and no way to adjust,58666,3
58667,I loved the top even thought it's made smaller than expected.,58667,3
58667,The bottoms are very uncomfortable.,58667,3
58667,I ended up using a bottom to another suit.,58667,3
58668,"As others have said, the card slots are a bit large for credit cards, so they tend to float around and risk falling out, but otherwise, this worked out pretty nicely.",58668,3
58668,Wish there was some kind of neck strap to go along with it.,58668,3
58668,Carrying it around when traveling light is a bit of a pain.,58668,3
58669,"The quality isn't amazing, but that makes sense given the price.",58669,3
58669,It was larger than I expected it would be (I got the medium and am a size 4-6).,58669,3
58670,This shirt is for tall people!!!,58670,3
58670,I am 5'3 and it looked way too large and baggy.,58670,3
58670,My friend is 5'11 and I gave it to her and it fit her perfectly.,58670,3
58670,It is a cute shirt but way too large!,58670,3
58671,Nice color but material was way too thin~,58671,3
58672,The size was off for unisex & baesd on my womans size 8 they were too large.,58672,3
58673,Pretty but nasty smell even after washing & 1month of use,58673,3
58674,The straps on this are adjustable but it still didn't fit properly and was rather itchy.,58674,3
58674,It's a very beautiful nightgown but I would recommend going up one size.,58674,3
58674,I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,58674,3
58675,"Was to small, but pretty",58675,3
58676,The only reason I give it a 3 is because it is a knockoff!,58676,3
58676,"If it was real it would say ""Made in France"".",58676,3
58676,"Mine said ""Made in Spain"".",58676,3
58676,Everything else is great about it.,58676,3
58676,Should of done my research.,58676,3
58676,The real thing costs a pretty penny.,58676,3
58676,It's true... You get what you pay for.,58676,3
58677,"Case is nice, the clip is not attached and VERY hard to get in the little hole that is there, so, it ended up puncturing another hole.",58677,3
58677,I do like that it has a couple credit card slots although it does not hold many.,58677,3
58677,"Taking pics with it is a little awkward but, camera does fit good in it and price is good.",58677,3
58678,Very difficult to close.,58678,3
58679,"Some of the stitching is loose, you can tell it's cheaply made.",58679,3
58679,But it served it's purpose so I'm happy.,58679,3
58680,The shirt is very different from the photograph in that the smaller checks (what appears as mostly grey in the photograph) are larger in person and there is very little difference between the left and right side of the shirt.,58680,3
58680,"You can tell if you look closely that the checks are slightly different sizes, but instead of looking stylish it looks like a mistake in the fabric.",58680,3
58680,"Overall, the cut of the shirt is very nice and it does fit properly, however the seams give off threads though they've yet to break or tear.",58680,3
58681,Bought the red before n it fits great but this green is two sizes too large,58681,3
58682,"A little big up top, but still cute on.",58682,3
58683,"Not enough room between shoe bottom and laces, press down on the top of my foot.",58683,3
58683,Width and length just fine,58683,3
58684,I thinks its comfortable,58684,3
58685,I had ordered the Burgundy gown and what I have gotten was more like a rosy red (like another comment stated) I thought I'd give it a try because I did not see any photos (I'll update with a picture soon) I am on the short side of a body build and my torso isn't that tall either.,58685,3
58685,"The bodice what a bit large on me (I am 5""4') Other wise It'd be perfect.",58685,3
58685,I ordered this for my prom dress expecting a burgundy gown and settled for the red  because it did not feel or look cheap at all.,58685,3
58685,"Worth the price, really.",58685,3
58685,Would have given 5 if advertised correctly.,58685,3
58687,"A little small, very short.",58687,3
58687,"Rhinestones come off easy, likely a one wear dress unless you can sew.",58687,3
58687,Color is not as vibrant.,58687,3
58689,"It's made a well, but runs too small.",58689,3
58690,Does not look like the picture makes it appear.,58690,3
58691,"I like the necklace its cute, only got a problem in earrings its easily fall out and make my ear itch.",58691,3
58692,This is really cut but it was MUCH smaller than I'd expected.,58692,3
58692,I should have looked at sizes better - it's really small note paper.,58692,3
58692,"My daughter is happy and that's all that counts, but I don't think I'd buy it again.",58692,3
58694,Very nice material but they are cute super small I originally ordered a medium which I couldn't even get on the seller then sent me an XL at no extra charge and those fit but we're still super snug.,58694,3
58694,I'm only 5'7 137lbs and my true size is a medium to large.,58694,3
58694,Order 2 sizes up should you choose to get these.,58694,3
58695,The length is no where as pictured and fits very tight...,58695,3
58696,"Love the shirt, but it an XX large is really an xtra large.",58696,3
58698,they look good on and feel nice as well.,58698,3
58700,The material is not what I expected or rather what is shown in the picture seems to be linen or cotton...lycra is what I received...the fit was ok though,58700,3
58701,I AM  5'1 AND WEIGH 133 POUNDS  I ORDERED A XL WHICH IS TOO BIG SO A LG  WOULD HAVE FIT FINE.,58701,3
58701,ALSO THE COLOR ISN'T AS DARK IT A LIGHTER BLUE,58701,3
58702,Cute for those lazy days that I don't want to touch my hair.,58702,3
58702,"I bought it with the intention of sleeping in it; however, it's a little too large for my head so by the end of the night, it's resting on my pillow and not on my head.",58702,3
58703,Super tight fit and the picture on the front isn't centered well and lays to where it is cutting off part of her head.,58703,3
58703,It's pretty sturdy for the most part in allover assembly.,58703,3
58704,For $1.99 I will definately use it for childrens dress up.,58704,3
58704,Its beautifully made for the price.,58704,3
58705,much bigger than I thought it would be.,58705,3
58706,POSTS WERE NOT LONG ENOUGH.,58706,3
58706,THEY WERE EASY TO LOSE.,58706,3
58707,Probably give to my granddaughter,58707,3
58708,I ordered a large but should have ordered an extra large.,58708,3
58708,in fact I am usually a medium.,58708,3
58708,so it runs very small.,58708,3
58708,I'm just going to be cautious in how I wash and dry it.,58708,3
58709,On the small size,58709,3
58710,"First, this shirt took forever to arrive, but I guess that's what happens when you order from China.",58710,3
58710,"Second, it's just ""ok."" I am 5'4"" and 124 lbs.",58710,3
58710,"I am small on top, around the shoulders and bust.",58710,3
58710,I bought a medium because some people say they run big.,58710,3
58710,"The part around the shoulders and bust is fine, but the part around the mid-section is too big and baggy.",58710,3
58710,The band around the bottom is awkward and puffy and too big.,58710,3
58710,"But if I'd gone smaller for the bottom part, the shoulder, bust and arms areas would probably be too small.",58710,3
58710,I don't feel it's proportioned well.,58710,3
58710,"It seemed like too much trouble to return it after that long wait, and I don't dislike it completely, so I'll go ahead and wear it.",58710,3
58711,The material was pretty rough which made it a little uncomfortable to wear without an undershirt,58711,3
58712,If you are sensitive to touch - like sensory processing disorder which comes along with being ADHD/ADD or autistic - I am ADHD..,58712,3
58712,They feel SO WEIRD til about the tenth hour of wearing them and they finally get more soft but hard rubbery material.,58712,3
58712,My heel pain is starting to go away due to plantar fasciitis.,58712,3
58712,I have a super high arch so the arch support isn't as good as i expected it.,58712,3
58712,Add more arch support and I'll give a higher rating.,58712,3
58713,"These are smaller than actual size, so I would get one size bigger.",58713,3
58713,I usually wear a medium and should have gotten a large.,58713,3
58713,I think they are made in China!,58713,3
58715,the top was the perfect fit.,58715,3
58715,but the shorts were too small,58715,3
58716,"The sizing for these gloves are not the best, the pair I purchased claim they're good for years 2 through 4.",58716,3
58716,"My son turns three next month, and these are still quite big on him.",58716,3
58717,I love this boho look but it bothers me that the bottom layer of this dress is a shade different than the upper dress.,58717,3
58717,I considered swapping for the white color but am not inclined to incur anymore expense.,58717,3
58717,Otherwise is so cute on!,58717,3
58719,the size runs small - not a true 14/16 more like a 8/10,58719,3
58720,Was a little disappointed in the type of material,58720,3
58721,"Color of top was pretty, but something about sleeves just didn't lay right and top looked silly.",58721,3
58722,I got the smallest size and it was still too large for me.,58722,3
58723,the logo colors sort of faded.,58723,3
58723,the size is a bit small so I'd order a size bigger,58723,3
58724,they are super cute.,58724,3
58724,but the waist band is not supportive and they do not stay up well.,58724,3
58724,"The seam is very weak, and a few stitches came out after a couple of wears.",58724,3
58724,I am thinking of doing some reinforcing and alterations on them.,58724,3
58724,"I really like they way they look, and wish they were better made.",58724,3
58725,it fits small if you order go up a size,58725,3
58726,"For the price, you can't go wrong.",58726,3
58726,"The tulle skirt is very poufy and it has an empire type waist (at least it did on me, but I have a long torso) agreed it does arrive very wrinkled.",58726,3
58726,"Also, I ordered two different sizes and on one size the zipper was already messed up right out of the bag, but the other dress, the zipper is fine, so it appears the zipper issue is hit or miss.",58726,3
58727,"I like these shirts, they are just a bit small to wear to workout in.",58727,3
58727,Was looking for something a little more flowy.,58727,3
58728,I wish I would have bought the medium instead of the large.,58728,3
58728,I would say buy your normal size.,58728,3
58728,"Everyone loved the costume, but it was too expensive.",58728,3
58729,So I bought this as a just in case jacket for a recent trip.,58729,3
58729,It worked for what I bought it for.,58729,3
58729,I didn't get a chance to wear the jacket in a hardcore rainstorm but in a little must it kept me dry.,58729,3
58729,I don't think it would keep me dry for more then a couple minutes In a storm.,58729,3
58729,I wouldn't call it water proof but more water repellent.,58729,3
58729,The sizes are totally off.,58729,3
58729,They run both short and small.,58729,3
58729,"I ordered a M, L, XL, & XXL.",58729,3
58729,I ended up keeping the XXL.,58729,3
58729,I am 6ft2 190lbs with a pretty athletic build.,58729,3
58729,I can usually fit in a Medium size from most stores.,58729,3
58729,While a tall size shirt is not necessary I feel more comfortable in a tall size.,58729,3
58730,There are a few youtube vids on how to make this better.,58730,3
58730,It's good quality cloth and has a metal pin on the front but the sides are a bit loose.,58730,3
58730,I fixed it in about 30 minutes and minimum sewing and it looks 100% better.,58730,3
58730,I recommend it as long as you realize it's not an exacting copy from the films.,58730,3
58731,The band of the hat fitts nicely.,58731,3
58731,"The top part of the hat is large, so there is empty space between the top of my head and the top of the hat.",58731,3
58732,This was a beautiful color but this skirt runs small and not expensive looking.,58732,3
58733,"Too small and too short, so I have to send it back.",58733,3
58734,Adorable but large for an infant.,58734,3
58735,I love sleeping beauty but the images are out of focus,58735,3
58736,"toooo heavy, but it is ok, more like.... for ""full figured"" .... full breasted"" ladies :).",58736,3
58737,Nice but would not order again.,58737,3
58738,bought it for a 10 year old who had to have it.,58738,3
58739,I ordered a large and they are way too tight.,58739,3
58739,I'm usually between a medium or large at Victoria secret.,58739,3
58740,"Not sold on it yet- has a ""odor"" so hopefully in time it will go away- I love the color so for the price it works.",58740,3
58741,"One size, looks like the pic but too short......overall I like it, will still wear it",58741,3
58742,I typically wear a xl but ordered a xxl after reading the reviews.,58742,3
58742,it is basically a perfect fit.,58742,3
58742,The waist strap in the back doesn't stay very well.,58742,3
58742,Getting out of my fabric chair at work makes it loosen.,58742,3
58742,I over compensated the clip position to make sure it doesn't come undone.,58742,3
58742,The fabric is odd.,58742,3
58742,It is shiny and professional but get wrinkled really easy.,58742,3
58742,It feels cheap but for the price I kind of expected that.,58742,3
58742,I don't expect the fabric to last long before it starts looking messy.,58742,3
58742,Spend a little more and get something that has fabric that will look great all day long.,58742,3
58743,We arentnin a size 3 months yet so neutral review for now,58743,3
58745,very nice shirts but neck is to large,58745,3
58746,Besides this dress being too small it was really cute.,58746,3
58746,I'm 5' 135lbs ordered a medium and I could barely get it on.,58746,3
58746,The neckline is a little weird too.,58746,3
58746,I really wanted to love it.,58746,3
58746,The fabric is a little polyester like but it's thickness is nice.,58746,3
58747,You would have to order one size smaller than your actual size for the bra to fit.,58747,3
58748,Was not exactly what I was expecting made for a bifold wallet,58748,3
58749,The dress top fit perfect but like most out fits the bottom pants were way to small but still looked cute for the pics,58749,3
58750,they are really cute but they are too long for my litttle legs and go right up to my crotch and make me look like i a have fat rolls above them badly.,58750,3
58752,very cute but a little uncomfy.,58752,3
58753,"Was looking forward to this tote, bought in the stone color.",58753,3
58753,"First day I used it, and the handle started coming apart.",58753,3
58753,"Going back, I didn't spend a ton, but I do expect it to last more than 24 hours.",58753,3
58754,"It is too small, and though I receive, because it's Asian product, I selected XXL, and it still fitted as a size 10; however, I was able to sale it and retrieved my money back off it without going through shipping.",58754,3
58755,The legs are not a wide and I thought they would be.,58755,3
58755,They are more of a cream color than a white.,58755,3
58756,"The t-shirts are beautiful, but they are making them too long in length.",58756,3
58756,I believe this will be the last t-shirt that I will buy from this company...,58756,3
58757,Fits very small definitely not the size it reads more like a size smaller and the cut on the bottom was too short.,58757,3
58758,Pouch is somewhat small and tight.,58758,3
58758,"I usually wear US L, but for these I would definitely need XL.",58758,3
58758,Too bad they do not have it.,58758,3
58759,Not the color of blue I needed,58759,3
58760,As cute as these are the green ones left a green stain on my ears.,58760,3
58760,I was not happy at all when that happened.,58760,3
58760,You can tell these are cheap but honestly it was expected with how much I paid.,58760,3
58760,I'm giving 3 stars because they were true to size and the other two pairs were ok.,58760,3
58760,I'm just so disappointed with the green pair.,58760,3
58761,It was to short for me love the idea.,58761,3
58761,Purchase the black long,58761,3
58762,"Quite a tight fit, though.",58762,3
58763,it's ok but I expected it to be larger.,58763,3
58763,I'll have to wear it as a shirt,58763,3
58764,I ordered a medium and I am a size C bra size 5 pant normally.,58764,3
58764,The top is pretty lose but I'll still wear it.,58764,3
58764,"However, the bottoms fit like children's bikini bottoms.",58764,3
58764,They are WAY to small in the back.,58764,3
58767,Didn't hit me in the right spot.,58767,3
58769,It's too short to be a dress but still cute as a tunic with leggings.,58769,3
58771,Bottom was too small.,58771,3
58771,The top was just right though.,58771,3
58771,I have to buy another bottom piece to match..,58771,3
58772,They're adorable but don't fit my son and I have to return,58772,3
58773,Works well with thick shirts clips did not slip.,58773,3
58773,Not so well with thin summer shirts clips would not stay on shirt,58773,3
58774,This took sooooo.. long I forget what it looked like.,58774,3
58774,"It's ok, but I was very turned off by the delivery time, and then I found out that the package was lost.",58774,3
58774,It was not worth the wait.,58774,3
58775,It is a little tight around the chest area.,58775,3
58775,Everywhere else fit fine,58775,3
58776,Straps are a little loose,58776,3
58777,The material is not very good it doesnt really stay in place,58777,3
58778,Much larger than I expected,58778,3
58779,"too small, gave away",58779,3
58780,Arms were very small and tight.,58780,3
58780,the rest of the dress fit fine,58780,3
58781,5'5 big hips small torse and chest 135lbs i got size M and it's a bit loose.,58781,3
58781,It will be cute after i take it in on the sides a little.,58781,3
58782,the snap closure is kind of loose and flimsy- have to wear the jacket open,58782,3
58783,These earrings do not set into my ears - but stand out a little which I do not care for.,58783,3
58784,The hat is a little tall but will do the job.,58784,3
58785,It is really see through but hard to get the top up on the shoulders.,58785,3
58785,In ordered a 3x,58785,3
58787,"poorly made, but if you have sewing knowledge it's easy to fix, runs small, but still a good shirt",58787,3
58788,The designs are awesome and I would buy tons from this vendor but the size is not even CLOSE.,58788,3
58789,"runs pretty small, definitely order up a size or two.",58789,3
58790,My grandson loves DanTDM,58790,3
58791,Material is see through and despite being a xl its way to small more like a medium.,58791,3
58791,But luckily I've gotta kid who can wear it,58791,3
58792,I wanted to wear this outfit on my trip to Vegas its perfect for going out but unfortunately I have it to my sister because it was too small..,58792,3
58792,I'm 5'8 about 180 lbs I ordered a large it fit me like a medium,58792,3
58793,After reading the comments on how it runs small I decided to order a size up and got a medium.,58793,3
58793,It was too big.,58793,3
58793,Other than that it's an ok dress.,58793,3
58793,"The sequins fall off very easily, it's a little bit itchy to wear.",58793,3
58793,I would recommend wearing a slip under it since it's so sheer.,58793,3
58793,It's really cute though.,58793,3
58793,You basically get what you pay for.,58793,3
58794,"I wear a 1X at Torrid, and ordered the ""Plus Size 1X/2X"" stockings.",58794,3
58794,"When they arrived, the package said ""suitable for 150-200 lbs"".",58794,3
58794,That is not 1X/2X - the average 150lb woman is a size 10.,58794,3
58794,But I carried on anyway.,58794,3
58794,"The stockings stretched ok, but there is no way that they would stay up.",58794,3
58794,"Without a garter belt, they rolled down to my knees immediately.",58794,3
58794,"With a garter belt, the edges still rolled heavily, so you don't get that smooth line like the picture.",58794,3
58794,"There is no grippy texture on the thigh, they are literally just hose pieces.",58794,3
58794,They are also non-breathable nylon.,58794,3
58794,Not like regular pantyhose.,58794,3
58794,You get NO air inside the hose.,58794,3
58794,My legs were sweaty and all the sweat just stayed in the hose with me.,58794,3
58794,"All in all, they are ok for light novelty wear.",58794,3
58794,But not all-night costume quality.,58794,3
58795,Its short[if you have a longer torso i would not recommentd].,58795,3
58795,It rolls at the top.,58795,3
58796,Would suggest buying a bigger size than suggested above as mine were a bit short.,58796,3
58796,Have not tried them in water yet.,58796,3
58796,Used them to excursive but again due to them being to tight on my toes its hard to judge how long I could wear them had they fit correctly.,58796,3
58797,Silky fabric but don't like the cheap elastic waistband.,58797,3
58798,The bows fell off within a week but they are cute with or without them.,58798,3
58799,The fabric is thinner than it looks in the picture.,58799,3
58799,However not saying it's a bad thing...just not what I thought I was getting.,58799,3
58799,"Overall, I like it..very colorful.",58799,3
58799,I just hope it lasts the season.,58799,3
58800,Is cute...thought fringe would cover my stomach more but didnt.,58800,3
58800,I ordered two sizes larger almost didn't fit.,58800,3
58800,Order way up ladies,58800,3
58802,it is just fine,58802,3
58803,I ordered my normal size and it is way to small for me.,58803,3
58803,Both colors I ordered were the same.,58803,3
58803,The shirt is really cute and made well but your sizing is not at all consistent.,58803,3
58804,Ordered an xl for my daughter.,58804,3
58804,It's very low cut.,58804,3
58804,Not really pleased with the dress.,58804,3
58805,"a nice belt, but very difficult to work with the strange buckle...",58805,3
58805,"I may be the problem, but i have yet to master it",58805,3
58806,"Comfortable, but a bit too tight.",58806,3
58806,The padding is very thick.,58806,3
58807,My grandaughter loved this dress but it is very thin fabric and the collar /bow  doesn't really stay down.,58807,3
58808,"I tried to order a size larger than normal, but it was still tight.",58808,3
58810,It seems this product is made with lots of inconsistencies.,58810,3
58810,"For reference, I am 5'3"" and 115 lbs.",58810,3
58810,"I ordered an x-small and it was way too loose in the chest area, too tight in the arms, but perfect in length.",58810,3
58810,With some very tall heels it just grazed the floor.,58810,3
58810,"I returned and ordered a new one, and this time the sleeves were too loose and the length way too long.",58810,3
58810,"It's a very pretty dress, but I will be returning again due to the poor fit.",58810,3
58811,"The cut is not as low as pictured, and the strings are a lot closer together.",58811,3
58811,"It's still a cute shirt, just maybe not the same one in the picture, but similar.",58811,3
58812,So thin it is transparent.,58812,3
58813,It would have fit if the back strap stretched :/ You have to have very small ribs.,58813,3
58813,"I'm a D and got XL, but it was too small.",58813,3
58813,"I gave it to my sister with a B cup, and its a little tight on her.",58813,3
58813,"It would have been very cute though, if it would have fit.",58813,3
58814,I'm 5'0 and 120 pounds and and XL fits like a M. Runs small.,58814,3
58816,"For reference: 37"" chest, 6'0"" tall, 30"" waist, 145lb

The chest of the shirt and shoulders fit fine, but the arm holes are big enough to accommodate a leg, and the back of the neck is so stiff that it has a tendency to lift up.",58816,3
58817,"I like it, but it has some dirt spots & the place to put credit cards is too small for most credit cards",58817,3
58818,Clasp is not working.,58818,3
58818,Keep opening on me,58818,3
58819,Got 102 were a bit smaller than expected,58819,3
58820,The stitching tore within the first hour of wear.,58820,3
58821,This would totally have 5 stars if the garment had been constructed correctly.,58821,3
58821,The neckline folds strangely where the fabric won't lie down and its an obvious flaw in sewing.,58821,3
58821,"The design, however is gorgeous and very flattering.",58821,3
58822,It's too small....but it a nice dress.,58822,3
58822,Maybe I'll get a large,58822,3
58823,Cute design but way too small!,58823,3
58824,Top and bottom both fit.,58824,3
58824,"Top is the correct neon green color and looks good but the straps are sewn on and I can't remove them, and the bottom is yellow and cut in a weird way that looks different from the other pictures for this item.",58824,3
58824,"I'm 36C/D, size 6 bottoms, 126lbs, and 5'3.",58824,3
58824,I ordered a large,58824,3
58826,I wish I would have paid more attention to the length of the box.,58826,3
58826,"It is too short to hold my 16, 18, and 20 inch necklaces.",58826,3
58826,Next time I will check the dimension.,58826,3
58827,"Because my child is only 12 months, the size of this set was perfect.",58827,3
58827,He could manage the bucket and the shovels fit his hand.,58827,3
58827,"However, the shovels are almost useless because they are so small and fall apart if you dig in the sand at all.",58827,3
58827,"The sunglasses are cute, but again just for fun.",58827,3
58828,Appears I have a flat butt so not as alluring as I had hoped for.,58828,3
58829,"These were super cute and seemed good quality, however  the crotch only came up the middle of my daughter's thighs.",58829,3
58829,"They seemed more of a children's size, even though they weren't advertised as so.",58829,3
58830,"Cute dress, just thin and doesn't cover any chubby area, even with spanx it is unforgiving.",58830,3
58831,Consider the price of this ring before you purchase.,58831,3
58831,Obviously this is a fashion ring made from cheap materials.,58831,3
58831,"The seller should not be given ""poor quality"" ratings because individuals thought this was a ""quality"" product.",58831,3
58831,It is what it is explained to be.,58831,3
58831,"The ring:
A deep bronze coloring.",58831,3
58831,Has rabbit features throughout top and bottom.,58831,3
58831,Is able to be size adjusted (slightly)!,58831,3
58831,"It is not precious metal so it will turn your fingers green (to prevent this either apply two coats of UV Clear Gel Polish and Cure or apply a thin layer of ""hot glue"" from a glue gun.",58831,3
58831,"Why I gave it 3 stars:
I did not like how it looked on.",58831,3
58831,"It was very, very small and adjusting it to a larger size looked like I had sausage fingers.",58831,3
58831,"I did not hate the ring, it just wasn't for me.",58831,3
58831,"With that being said, I recommend this ring for anyone with smaller, very lady-like fingers, you will love it!",58831,3
58831,"It is very cute, accurately represented, and has very detailed features, just not for me.",58831,3
58832,This wallet would be ok in a purse but not as a mans wallet.,58832,3
58832,"Its light weight and padded, It will not hold up being pulled out of a pocket.",58832,3
58833,fits on the smaller side esp.,58833,3
58834,I bought the houndstooth suit by the same company in size XXL so I bought the same with this one.,58834,3
58834,"However, strangely the bottoms of this blue and pink floral suit is too tight.",58834,3
58834,Cuts in uncomfortably on my hips.,58834,3
58834,BUT I will say I have wide hips (I usually wear a size 14 or XL in pants).,58834,3
58834,The top was fine though (I'm a size 8/10 or M on top).,58834,3
58834,I will be returning this blue floral one but keeping the houndstooth one.,58834,3
58834,*I received this item at a discount*,58834,3
58835,Didn't realize how low cut this would be.,58835,3
58835,"I'm all for showing a bit of cleavage, but almost my entire boob?",58835,3
58835,A little bit much.,58835,3
58835,But it is a gorgeous shirt.,58835,3
58836,NOT FOR PEAR SHAPED WOMEN.,58836,3
58836,"The shorts are made very well and very soft; however, if you are pear shaped they flare on at the bottom on the inside and outside.",58836,3
58837,Attractive wristlet/wallet but the zipper has a tendency to stick.,58837,3
58839,The bottoms fit my wife is size 6 but the top in large is for a a or b cup,58839,3
58840,Like all the rest of the comments the dress runs a little bit small i normally whear a large in a dress so i went up to a xl and its still kinda small but i still love this dress i have bigger boobs (DD) so its not as poofy there as shown on the model so i just added a black belt to that area.,58840,3
58840,Its a little short on me because I have a bigger frame but its one of my favorite dressed and my husband askes me to wear it quite a bit as well.,58840,3
58840,I am going to be ordering a black one very soon as well,58840,3
58842,Not as floppy as what the picture shows.,58842,3
58844,"Beautiful dress, though the torso was a long fit and the clasp at the top of the neck was hanging barely by a string.",58844,3
58845,"Beautiful dress, but it was too small and didn't fit.",58845,3
58845,It's very see-through and did not come with the clear straps that it is pictured with.,58845,3
58846,Not good support if you have larger breasts.,58846,3
58846,The Bottoms were 1 size  to small,58846,3
58847,"OMG, you would have to be stick thin to get this zipped.",58847,3
58847,"I ordered size L, and I am 5,6 150 lbs, and thin.",58847,3
58847,"Materiel is cheap looking, but not scratchy.",58847,3
58847,"The bottom part that covers your front-bottom area, is lightly tacked in to the dress, it is not sewn it all the way around.",58847,3
58847,Thought that was weird.,58847,3
58847,"If your a little frame, no curves, here's your dress, but if you have any hips, butt, boobs, its not for us.",58847,3
58848,Not sure if I like it.,58848,3
58848,Not loving the texture.,58848,3
58849,"My wife likes the color and style very much, but it is very small.",58849,3
58850,"I wear Large and I bought a Large, fits perfectly.",58850,3
58850,"Zipper came off track when I tried it on, but my boyfriend fixed it pretty easily.",58850,3
58850,He had to take the pins at the bottom of the zipper off and realign it.,58850,3
58850,"On my second day of wearing it and seeing other people with their costumes at the Texas Ren Fest, I realized I  am missing the apron.",58850,3
58850,I would have given it 4 stars if I wasn't missing a piece.,58850,3
58851,"These are cute, but you do get what you pay for.",58851,3
58851,One of the stones is set crooked and it's fairly obvious.,58851,3
58851,"No one is going to think these are real, but they are cute enough.",58851,3
58852,"Beautiful shirt, but had to order a 3X to fit a L body.",58852,3
58853,I'm sure it will be perfect for what I need it for.,58853,3
58853,But the color (purple orchid) looks nothing like the picture shown.,58853,3
58853,It's much much darker.,58853,3
58853,"I chose this color because I thought it would be bright and stand out if it fell to the bottom of my purse, or was left on a table or any other scenario, I just wanted something eye catching.",58853,3
58853,Purple orchid is not what I was looking for.,58853,3
58854,Super cute but down fall is that it's two layers and you can't see my underwear!,58854,3
58854,Gotta have like skin tone underwear or something.,58854,3
58855,I really like the print of this fabric but it is on the thin side.,58855,3
58855,It would fit as shown for someone that is a size medium but not for anyone larger.,58855,3
58856,Too big for my fingers -- Im a size 6.75 to 7,58856,3
58857,All of them were great except for one of the dark gray ones which had big scratches on it.,58857,3
58857,They were deeps like small chunks were missing.,58857,3
58857,It almost looks like it got chewed on.,58857,3
58857,Pretty disappointed because I've gotten a ton of plugs from these guys and I've always been happy.,58857,3
58858,"Runs small, very cute on and light weight for summer ...",58858,3
58858,But I ordered the white one and received the grey one.,58858,3
58859,The studs are a bit short and not bent at the right angle.,58859,3
58859,"I bent them a bit more, but still not the right fit.",58859,3
58859,"The quality is fine, it's just a matter of personal preference that I wish they were a bit longer.",58859,3
58860,It looks very cheap.,58860,3
58861,"Doesn't stick well, have to wear tight outfit to hold it",58861,3
58863,"Bigger than I though, but that was ok.  Held up to being washed and dried just fine.",58863,3
58863,"Would be nice for a colder halloween, this year was warm and he got hot.",58863,3
58863,It's a medium weight fleece.,58863,3
58864,"I bought this in the largest size possible, hoping it would fit like the picture.",58864,3
58864,"I usually wear a medium in tops, and my chest size is 38D.",58864,3
58864,"I cannot even begin to pull it closed in the front, its like they ran out of fabric and just forgot the front part of the shirt, and the sleeves are very small, nothing like the picture.",58864,3
58864,"I let my 10 year old niece try this shirt on, and it wasn't even baggy on her.",58864,3
58864,"So either the girl in the photo weighs 40 pounds, or she is wearing a different shirt all together.",58864,3
58864,I hate being deceived into buying something and receiving a different product all together.,58864,3
58864,"I do love the print and the color, and I will keep it because it is not horrible and because it is shipped from China.",58864,3
58864,"But fit is nothing like the photo, not even close.",58864,3
58865,I was in love with this!,58865,3
58865,"It was my favorite earring, but the gem wouldn't twist on tight enough and I had ended up losing it in my sleep 2 days later.",58865,3
58866,Colors are accurate with photo.,58866,3
58866,"I am 5' and 100 pounds, petite, thought it'd be more slouchy, it's a little more fitted than expected",58866,3
58867,"It is a cute bag, really it is, but the strap broke after having it for only a couple of months.",58867,3
58867,"I never really put a lot of stuff in it either, so there was no reason for it.",58867,3
58868,However it's too small.,58868,3
58868,The image isn't distorted though.,58868,3
58868,"It fits up to my thighs,  being curvy I should have seen this coming.",58868,3
58868,I will have to loose about 50 pounds to fit into these properly.,58868,3
58869,Material is great and looks wonderful but I'm a little bustier and the zipper in my he back didn't lie smoothly.,58869,3
58869,Didn't wear it for the event I bought it for.,58869,3
58869,If I go larger than the whole dress would be too big,58869,3
58870,This was just barely cute enough for me to keep.,58870,3
58870,The back is very long (which I guess they show you in the last picture).,58870,3
58870,The reviews say order a size up so I got a Medium when I'm normally a Small.,58870,3
58870,"However, I think I could have gotten a small.",58870,3
58870,"Its a bit baggy and the extremely long back just looks silly, so I will probably only wear this shirt tucked in.",58870,3
58870,Furthermore it is **very sheer**!,58870,3
58870,I plan to only wear it with an undershirt.,58870,3
58871,Just ok.  A lot smaller than expected.,58871,3
58872,The shirt's sound meter isn't very powerful.,58872,3
58872,If the music is too soft it barely responds.,58872,3
58872,"Aside from that, the design is nice.",58872,3
58873,I really like this choker and wear it frequently.,58873,3
58873,"However, the clasp broke and I had to repair it, and the bow started to fall off and I need to superglue it back on.",58873,3
58873,Very cute but made with cheap materials.,58873,3
58874,I will keep it...,58874,3
58875,The top fits fine but the bottom ... not even when I was 8 years!,58875,3
58875,"I plan to wear it with another bottom because the top is really nice, comfortable and original!",58875,3
58876,Runs small so get a size up from normal.,58876,3
58876,No complaints other than that.,58876,3
58877,Works well but when buying pay attention to the size chart because runs a little small,58877,3
58878,"I had ordered a medium due to reviews recommending sizing up 2 sizes, so I went up one size and it was too large and returned.",58878,3
58878,The small ended up being a little too long in the torso for me but I am on the shorter side!,58878,3
58879,i gave it as a gift to my niece for her 6month old.,58879,3
58879,She said it ran large and will wait until the baby is older to use it.,58879,3
58880,It works for me in the sun.,58880,3
58880,Has a chin strap.,58880,3
58880,The only issue I have is that the brim is so large I cannot see unless a fold it back a bit.,58880,3
58880,It is a tad big for my head as well.,58880,3
58880,But it is cute and does its job.,58880,3
58880,The picture of just me is with the hat tilted back on my head as the brim is too large.,58880,3
58880,Then the second picture is with the brim folded back and the hat setting correct on my head.,58880,3
58881,There is an issue with the stitching at the wrist.,58881,3
58881,The pull tab to tighten came off the first time they were worn.,58881,3
58882,I purchased the foot loop variety.,58882,3
58882,I'm 6'1 with relatively longer legs so I had to max out the adjustable straps.,58882,3
58882,"While they worked, they were uncomfortable likely because they couldn't be adjusted any longer than possible.",58882,3
58882,If you are under 6 feet I'd recommend these for sure because they do work as advertised.,58882,3
58882,"If you are over, maybe the foot loop variety isn't the best option.",58882,3
58883,"This is nice, but not super.",58883,3
58883,It looks noticeably cheaper next to my Pandora charms.,58883,3
58883,But I like the colors.,58883,3
58884,"I like the dress, but I had to have the  dress altered in the hip area  as it was too curvy on both sides.",58884,3
58884,I am not a small woman and this dress flared out quite a bit on both hip sides,58884,3
58885,Small in the legs,58885,3
58886,"I was very pleased with this bag, except for the shoulder strap.",58886,3
58886,"After only using it for about one week, the clasps that attach the shoulder strap to the bag have broken.",58886,3
58886,"I used the bag as advertised to carry a 15.6-inch laptop and a few books, so I am very frustrated that it has become a problem so quickly.",58886,3
58886,"As you can see in the photos I uploaded, the clasps fall open by themselves, which causes them to become separated from the bag easily.",58886,3
58886,"Whenever I prepare to pick up the bag, I need to re-attach the shoulder strap.",58886,3
58886,So far I have been lucky enough that the strap has not separated while I was carrying the bag.,58886,3
58886,"Like I said, other than this issue the bag is great.",58886,3
58886,It is attractive and big enough to hold many items.,58886,3
58886,"However, it's not a cheap bag and for the price I expected it to be good-as-new for quite some time.",58886,3
58886,"If you decide to buy this, make sure you have another shoulder strap already.",58886,3
58888,Very sheer t shirt.,58888,3
58888,I normally wear a medium to large size shirt.,58888,3
58888,I bought an XL after reading the reviews and it is still tighter than I would like.,58888,3
58888,It is so thin I can see the tattoo on my stomach through the shirt.,58888,3
58891,"Shirt looks great on stage, but it is already starting to tear along the V neck lining.",58891,3
58891,Also had a few frayed strings on the arm when I took it out of the package.,58891,3
58891,Wish I could get this in good quality.,58891,3
58891,I'd pay much more for a bad azz shirt that lasted.,58891,3
58892,This didn't work for my shape.,58892,3
58892,It is more like a bra size than a halter top.,58892,3
58893,"Pretty dress for the price but sizing is very small, especially the waist area.",58893,3
58893,I ordered an XL just in case and I'm glad I did.,58893,3
58893,It fits more like a US medium so keep this in mind when ordering.,58893,3
58893,It is a little on the thin side as well.,58893,3
58893,It is very long as pictured.,58893,3
58894,"It's a lot more poofy than I expected, almost felt like a tutu",58894,3
58895,It's kinda small to size,58895,3
58896,looks kind of wonky,58896,3
58897,"The shirt didn't come with the string attached to the shirt, I had to loop it in myself.",58897,3
58897,The only way you can loop in the string is the same way you would tie a shoe.,58897,3
58897,"Considering all that, the shirt doesn't look the same way it does online.",58897,3
58897,There were also a few threads loose near the sleeves.,58897,3
58897,Might have better luck buying from a different listing.,58897,3
58897,"The shirt doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look the way it does online.",58897,3
58897,I tied the rest of the string around my neck because I personally didn't like the way it looked hanging down.,58897,3
58898,These are fun gloves.,58898,3
58898,Set to a single color or let them run the rainbow.,58898,3
58898,Only downside was that one was broken when we got it (the wires aren't very secure to the control box in the wrist).,58898,3
58898,Otherwise it would have been a 5 star review.,58898,3
58899,Size runs somewhat small and not as heavy as I expected.,58899,3
58900,I have yet to buy a blouse that fits.,58900,3
58901,It works okay if you don't move around too much.,58901,3
58901,"If I'm moving around too much or bending a lot, the back of my pants comes out of the band.",58901,3
58902,I liked the concept of this.,58902,3
58902,I got it for the cruise that I took in March.,58902,3
58902,"The only issue is I am really small, and I have an equally small chest.",58902,3
58902,"So while this was super adorable on my best friend who is an average size and has a larger than average chest, it just did not work for me.",58902,3
58902,I was constantly fiddling with it so that my top stayed covered.,58902,3
58902,There was so much extra fabric draped at the top of my butt that I could have smuggled about 2 wine bottles without it being noticeable at all!,58902,3
58902,So while this is adorable for average sized women ( approximately sizes 8-14) this does not work for women that are a size 2.,58902,3
58902,"However, it may fit better if your waist is small like mine, but you have ridiculous booty gains and larger than a B chest.",58902,3
58903,Get your scissors ready to cut off and tie up all the loose ends.,58903,3
58904,Cute suit but the fit was too large and the bust part felt like cardboard and was too pointy!,58904,3
58905,the item looks better in the picture than in reality,58905,3
58906,It looks cute but the material felt cheap and there were no pockets which was a disappointment.,58906,3
58906,"I think I overpaid for what it is worth, but you win some and you lose some.",58906,3
58907,"Cute, but they fit huge.",58907,3
58907,"Normally wear a youth 5, and it was massive.",58907,3
58908,"Pretty, but way too small.",58908,3
58909,"You can dress up, be causal or dress down.",58909,3
58909,Sleeves are Mazda with a shorter cut.,58909,3
58910,cheap quality (I mean totally expected) but a great layering tee to wear with cardigans and kimonos.,58910,3
58911,"The clasp broke the second day I wore it otherwise it's pretty, I would have designed it a little different.",58911,3
58911,I had to make a new clasp for it.,58911,3
58912,The sizing chart was definitely off .,58912,3
58912,It was two sizes too small,58912,3
58913,"Beautiful, but very small.",58913,3
58914,Going to be returning it.,58914,3
58914,Wish I could have kept it.,58914,3
58915,The image isn't as sharp and the contrast of the image isn't as high as the product preview.,58915,3
58915,"It works and doesn't look bad, but not exactly what I was hoping for.",58915,3
58916,Only 90% cotton and 10% Poly.,58916,3
58916,Was advertised as 100% cotton,58916,3
58917,The material is a little on the thin side.,58917,3
58917,The shirt was much too big for me I will give it as a gift for my brother who it will fit nicely.,58917,3
58917,As for the quality like I said the material is a little on the thin side.,58917,3
58917,If you can get the right size for the price it's not too terribly bad,58917,3
58918,"cheaper metal, the stainless steel has a very youthful appeal, I think I will give to my 8 year old daughter",58918,3
58919,The color is nice and bright.,58919,3
58919,Pockets are a bit small in the back.,58919,3
58919,Looks fine with a tunic length top.,58919,3
58920,Cute but about two sizes small,58920,3
58921,"Grandcjild's feet too wide
  narrow shoe",58921,3
58922,"Loved the lights on it, but it easily broke and the antlers drooped after about 15 minutes of my son playing with it",58922,3
58923,Very pretty but too small definitely order one size up,58923,3
58924,Didn't work for me.,58924,3
58925,"Nicely made, my only complaint is its not long enough for a tall person who has a long torso.",58925,3
58926,"Disappointed they are too small for the size, wasted money, wish I could send back but daughter has worn once.",58926,3
58927,"I can't pass up a good deal, so what do I do?",58927,3
58927,"I buy two of these, one to gift one to keep.",58927,3
58927,"This like I said was a good deal with that being said
These dresses are comparable to a Walmart value priced dress .. Silly me I was hoping they would be more like a Nordstrom.",58927,3
58927,I like the style and did gift one to my daughter.,58927,3
58927,They are good enough to wear around the house or to a causal outing but not let's say out on a date if you are trying to impress.,58927,3
58928,Issue has been resolved therefore 3 stars for making me happy .,58928,3
58928,The pink shades weren't my taste tho maybe another color  or shape .,58928,3
58929,Material is very rough.,58929,3
58930,"After about two weeks of continuous wear the ""opal"" has fallen out and the hinge has oxidized to the point where it irritates my nose.",58930,3
58931,This is a nice blouse but not long enough in the front.,58931,3
58931,I probably should have bought one size bigger.,58931,3
58932,It's a cute suit and it's been doing fine in the water so far (I wear it under a rash guard water shirt while I surf) but the chest area is way too small for me.,58932,3
58932,I have this issue sometimes but I was hoping this material would be stretchy enough to give me coverage.,58932,3
58932,The chest area has zero support (I'm a 36 DD for reference) and it covers maybe 25% of my breasts which isn't really the look I'm going for haha.,58932,3
58932,I wear it with a sports bra now because I mostly use it under a rash guard for surfing or teaching swim lessons.,58932,3
58932,"Anyway, this suit would look great on someone with naturally very perky and somewhat small boobs as it's a very cute suit.",58932,3
58933,It's falling apart before even putting it on.,58933,3
58933,No hem was clean or even finished.,58933,3
58933,"The thread on the collar came lose causing the sweater to part from collar to shoulder (as it was folded and put away, lol).",58933,3
58933,The length is perfect but the arms are really short.,58933,3
58933,"You're forced to wear the sleeves folded or scrunched, which doesn't stay well with this flexible, manipulable material.",58933,3
58933,It is really comfy so it's actually worth it for me to just fix it up and go from there.,58933,3
58934,They have small frames and I was looking for something with bigger frames.,58934,3
58934,They stole one of the pictures from shevoke.,58934,3
58934,The Misha Rose Golds.,58934,3
58934,So that's supper annoying cause those are about $100 glasses and these are a different color and very delicate.,58934,3
58934,But you get what you pay for so I'm not too upset about it.,58934,3
58935,Weird back area; it's like putting on a small straight jacket and gets twisted easily.,58935,3
58935,Comes with pads (REMOVABLE THANKFULLY) for the insecure woman (or man).,58935,3
58935,Works when I'm out of other sports bras.,58935,3
58935,"Material and make is solid, I think.",58935,3
58936,"It is not so beautiful like the picture, I'm not happy about it.",58936,3
58937,"These aren't terrible, but weren't great either for me.",58937,3
58937,"They are very soft, but have a silkier, shinier texture than other jeggings and I thought that made them look less like denim.",58937,3
58937,"The real issue for me, though, was that they are too thin.",58937,3
58937,"They aren't see through, but for someone with thicker legs/butt it will show all the bumps.",58937,3
58937,"Also they are not as high waisted as I was hoping, so if you are bottom heavy, the pockets slide down your butt and look weird.",58937,3
58937,(I did like that they had real pockets though!),58937,3
58937,They don't offer as much smoothing/slimming/support as other options so they weren't as flattering on me personally.,58937,3
58938,nothing special but does the job,58938,3
58939,I like the shirt however it is just a little oversized,58939,3
58940,Kind of small and narrow for my face,58940,3
58941,"This is a nice product, but not as expected based on the size of phone advertised as fitting inside.",58941,3
58941,"Specs say it will fit a phone 6"" long, but this is only if you put the phone in one of the side pockets, and not the middle pocket.",58941,3
58941,"You can't fit a phone longer than 5.5"" in the middle pocket without a struggle and potentially scratching your screen on the zipper in the process.",58941,3
58941,"My Moto X Pure, which is 6"" long does NOT fit in the middle pocket, but it does fit in the side.",58941,3
58941,"If you have a lot of cards to cram into the card slots, this might not be workable for you.",58941,3
58941,"My Samsung Galaxy 6 (5.65"" long) slides into the middle pocket perfectly, however.",58941,3
58943,"Fit was good, but I returned the red color b/c it was see through.",58943,3
58944,it was much chunkier than I thought.,58944,3
58945,Color was much different than what I expected.,58945,3
58945,"However, the dress arrived quickly and size was pretty accurate",58945,3
58946,the material is easily strawed out.,58946,3
58946,the style is great and fitted well but the material started loosing out.,58946,3
58947,"Snug for the size, but very pretty on",58947,3
58948,"cute design, just okay sizing",58948,3
58949,I took measurements I usually wear a large this costume runs small but in the product & size information it's stated exact fit.,58949,3
58949,Im 5'0 160lbs size 36c bra.,58949,3
58949,I would've given 5 stars because the costume arrive promptly and it look nice.,58949,3
58949,However size chart did not match so I had to go out and purchase a costume I will be returning this costume if I'm allowed.,58949,3
58950,"The cups are HUGE yet the swimsuit ordered in xxxl is tight, in US size I am a 14 and a DD and the chest was just to big.",58950,3
58950,"I tried it once, the side seam ripped, the cups kept my boobs floating but not feeling secure.",58950,3
58950,"It is a cute swimsuit, I am going to re-sow it and see what happens.",58950,3
58950,Arrived promptly and in great packaging and the price is not to bad until you consider the work to fix it..,58950,3
58951,Easy to use and attractive.,58951,3
58951,Leather quality is sub par.,58951,3
58953,Hat looks fine and quality is decent but arrived one size too large.,58953,3
58953,Will blow off in a mild wind.,58953,3
58953,"Based on product page, XL should have been the right fit, but I should have gotten Large, not XL.",58953,3
58953,Not worth time to send back.,58953,3
58954,A little hard to get in since you have to go from the inside out.,58954,3
58954,I also was hoping they'd be a little smaller but that's my issue with offering great the wrong size.,58954,3
58955,It's a very thin see through material and the color is not as advertised.,58955,3
58955,Bummed when something ordered online isn't a decent quality.,58955,3
58956,The lace fits weird by the top of the boots.,58956,3
58957,It's cute but see through and super short.,58957,3
58957,"I'm 5'4"" so I got a large hoping it would be long enough for a dress, but it definitely won't work.",58957,3
58957,I'll use it as a swim suit cover up now.,58957,3
58958,This is ok for the price.,58958,3
58958,Pretty flimsy though--how long will it last?,58958,3
58958,"I SO wish someone would make this kind of tunic in a heavier weight, better quality material.",58958,3
58958,I'd pay more for it.,58958,3
58958,You can find these kinds of tunics on Zappos for $60 which is too much.,58958,3
58958,"Why can't there be something in between, say a $30 t-shirt type tunic that is not flimsy?",58958,3
58959,Very flattering for a nice body.,58959,3
58959,But it if you have a bigger belly it will stick out because it is slim fitting,58959,3
58960,a little to fitted.,58960,3
58961,Well made but the size charts are not accurate,58961,3
58962,"The material is soft, but even the large is too small.",58962,3
58962,I typically use size small.,58962,3
58963,"This is tight, black shirt (as in product photographs) but beyond that it doesn't really match up.",58963,3
58963,"Somewhat cheap material, comfortable enough, but thin and clingly, and the neckline and accompanying crisscross strings are not quite the same ""silky"" look that the picture has.",58963,3
58963,"Also, the shirt came WITHOUT the black string threaded through the tiny holes in the shirt, so I had to do that myself, and it was incredibly time consuming and quite difficult due to the thickness of the string and the small holes I was trying to fit them through.",58963,3
58963,"An overall all-right purchase, would not buy again or particularly recommend.",58963,3
58964,"Love everything about it, with the exception of the stripes that totally don't match the patterned top.",58964,3
58965,The Slouchy beanie is made of polyester yarn and since this is rather bouncy the quality of slouchiness does not really go with the former.,58965,3
58965,It can be forced into a somewhat slouchy demeanor however while one has ones back turned it transforms into the the geico gnome's hat.,58965,3
58965,"As well because of it's synthetic fabric or rather loose knit yarn fabric, it is HOT.",58965,3
58965,Even with holes big enough to stick ones finger through it is still HOT.,58965,3
58965,When wearing the edge rolled the metal tag disappears which would be fine were it not for another cloth tag indicating the hats maker sewn onto the inside of the hats edge.,58965,3
58965,Further this tag appears upside down were one daring enough to sport it with the hat edge in the turned up position.,58965,3
58965,"The hat is really only supposed to be worn in one fashion, not turned up, pulled presumably down over the ears, and not slouchy, as such I am rather sorry I paid as much as I did for it, when I could have purchased two truly slouchy, non hot, edge worn up or downable hats.",58965,3
58966,This hand chain is so confusing but pretty,58966,3
58967,The strap already fell apart,58967,3
58969,"When you rely on your monitor for judging the color in a purchase, I guess you deserve what you get.",58969,3
58969,"This scarf would be lovely except that the Orange looks like a light, bright neon orange.",58969,3
58969,I will donate it somewhere.,58969,3
58970,This shirt runs extremely small and the print image is extremely faded.,58970,3
58971,"Precious top but again I gave three stars because it is on the small size in the bust which, is why I sent back.",58971,3
58971,I am 125 lbs 5'4 and a 34 D. I ordered an X large but it was way too tight in the bust area though it fit beautifully everywhere else.,58971,3
58971,"It is not see through, unique and flattering design, and well made.",58971,3
58971,It would have been a keeper with a few more inches in the bust.,58971,3
58971,If you are a C cup or bigger I do not suggest.,58971,3
58972,Looks great but the fit is off do to the material,58972,3
58973,I was only able to wear it for two days after that the hooks for some reason were bent and I was not able to fix them.,58973,3
58974,this top was so cute for my daughter.,58974,3
58974,skirt part shorter than picture.,58974,3
58974,Should have purchased a size X-Large instead of her normal Medium.,58974,3
58975,Top part fits ok but bottoms are too snug.,58975,3
58976,Looks amazing.. Had it for awhile now but the edges are starting to pull off.,58976,3
58977,The straps aren't wide enough to make many designs.,58977,3
58978,"Straps are too short even at the longest length, pulling the back up into an inverted ""V"" shape.",58978,3
58978,"Also, it is a big tighter than expected around the bottom band for a 36.",58978,3
58978,It fits more like a 34 band IMHO.,58978,3
58978,"However, the cups are very good, nice push up effect and nice fabric.",58978,3
58978,"I would recommend sizing up on this and if you are taller, maybe skip it if you want your band to be flat across your back instead of pulling up.",58978,3
58978,"(For reference, I am 5'7"" and 125 lbs and normally wear a 36 B.)",58978,3
58979,probably my mistake when I ordered it.,58979,3
58979,Did not realize how wide it is.,58979,3
58979,It is wide with a large buckle.,58979,3
58979,Has limited pants that it goes well with.,58979,3
58981,NOT for me but made a great holiday present.,58981,3
58981,"Very nice, stylish, & comfortable.",58981,3
58982,just what I need.,58982,3
58983,Cons- The feathers do not lay in a totally pleasing fashion.,58983,3
58983,At least mine did not- I had one feather that want to stick up above the rest.,58983,3
58983,Pros- The color is pretty.,58983,3
58983,The hat is sturdy.,58983,3
58983,This was my Easter Bonnet and many people complemented the hat.,58983,3
58984,"fit a a little tight around the neck,",58984,3
58985,Very cute but fabric is cheap.,58985,3
58985,The most dissapointing this I'd that it was short in the legs but to big on the top (I had to tie it up in the back so my daughters chest would stop showing! ),58985,3
58986,I followed the directions to order 1 size down if right in between sizes.,58986,3
58986,Now I can't get it on so hoping I lose a little baby weight and then it'll fit.,58986,3
58987,I like them ok - Unfortunately I can only  wear them with boots because they slip down.,58987,3
58988,Too small...thin material  ...but very pretty.,58988,3
58989,"Ok for price, one of elbow patches in wrong place.",58989,3
58989,"Maybe these are the slightly imperfect , I sized up to a large, normally I wear medium in cardigans.",58989,3
58989,Other brands with same picture I hear people are not having this problem with elbow patches.,58989,3
58991,I loved this bag but it ripped to soon.,58991,3
58992,the best looking..I got so many compliments...but they broke after like 2 weeks.. i buy glasses for $5 that last longer... but they are so cute I'd probably buy them again!,58992,3
58993,Not the best quality but worth the money,58993,3
58994,It was nice but very small in the bust area.,58994,3
58995,"I really liked the design on this sweatshirt, but it is super small.",58995,3
58995,"I ordered a large (I'm 5'5) and it barely covered my midsection, and definitely was stretched to the max on my chest.",58995,3
58995,"Returned and not bothering with the XL since the L was so small, it probably still won't fit.",58995,3
58996,The boots fit true to size.,58996,3
58996,My zipper on my right boot busted about a week into me wearing them and I've still yet to be able to fix them.,58996,3
58996,My left one is doing fine!,58996,3
58997,Really nice dress for how much it costs.,58997,3
58997,wife wears it to church.,58997,3
58998,"I bought this dress two sizes larger than I typically wear, and it is still smaller than expected.",58998,3
58998,"It fits, but I wanted it to be looser on top.",58998,3
58998,The belt is an absolute joke- it must be the same one they include with the size 10-12 dress.,58998,3
58998,"If it fit as expected, this could be a flattering dress.",58998,3
58998,I doubt I'll buy another dress made by this company.,58998,3
58999,"If you're short like me, (5'3"", don't know my inseam but very short, my torso is definitely on the long side) these will fit like full sized leggings.",58999,3
58999,"I knew they would be on the longer side of capris, but not that long.",58999,3
59001,"Just OK, low cost, do the job, but look and feel cheap.",59001,3
59001,Worth the very low cost though.,59001,3
59002,There was a hole in the crotch area when I received them,59002,3
59003,"Bit of an awkward fit, but overall decent.",59003,3
59004,"The fur toward the top part of the fur section stands straight up which looks a little odd, but seems like a defect which I'm ok with since the price is so good",59004,3
59005,The shirts are cute and comfortable.,59005,3
59005,"But the sizes run really, really small.",59005,3
59006,The flowers on the shoulders were not sewn well and the material felt cheap.,59006,3
59006,"Also, the size was too large and I had to get it altered at my local alteration store.",59006,3
59006,"With how much this dress has cost me, I don't think it is worth it.",59006,3
59007,"I love the bracelet, but the clasp is very poor quality and does not close properly.",59007,3
59007,You have a big chance of losing the bracelet due to the clasp.,59007,3
59008,The material is ok. but its just to short on the torso.,59008,3
59009,It surprised me how beautiful it looked on my daughter.,59009,3
59009,Unfortunately the bracelet broke within hours of gifting it to my girl on her 2nd birthday.,59009,3
59009,"Being a 2 year old, she kept taking it on and off - stretching it each time instead of just rolling her hand through the circle.",59009,3
59009,It's the stretchy elastic string type of jewelry and the elastic snapped.,59009,3
59009,I highly recommend for older children.,59009,3
59009,(My 3.5 year old was really into stretching it out too - so I think closer to 5yo unless your kid is less destructive),59009,3
59010,"It's really cute, the color I love it, but it is big from the breast and waist part of the swim suit, so I gave it away....",59010,3
59011,This fit well however still found it a bit on the small side of the arm whith,59011,3
59012,They fit me snug.,59012,3
59012,these are dryclean only.,59012,3
59013,Kinda tacky but still cute,59013,3
59014,You get what you pay for with this towel.,59014,3
59014,"I wasn't sure what a ""rally towel"" was.",59014,3
59014,"It's a tiny, thin, cheap towel.",59014,3
59014,"Made for waving in the air and looking like a little hand towel, I guess.",59014,3
59015,"It looks great, but the material is not what I expected",59015,3
59016,I will upload a picture later on but I was just not please with the fit.,59016,3
59016,It wasn't snugged and that's what I was looking for.,59016,3
59016,Maybe it's because I don't have enough hips so there was a huge gap in the backside area.,59016,3
59016,"However, the skirt came in great condition and it is the skirt that's pictured I am simply not keeping the item because it's not the look I was looking for.",59016,3
59017,My youngest is really into Batman so my wife ordered him this batman back pack.,59017,3
59017,I can tell already that this is the kind of quality that is going to force you to buy a new backpack every year.,59017,3
59017,If you are looking for a few months of fun this is a nice option.,59017,3
59017,"However, if you are looking for durability you may want to keep shopping.",59017,3
59018,The clips are either on backwards or it clips in the back.,59018,3
59019,I like the Bangle,59019,3
59020,the product is ok but make sure and get the correct size..,59020,3
59021,"I had higher expectations, and even ordered a size up based off of the reviews, but it is a short dress on my 5'3"" frame.",59021,3
59021,"The fit is OK, but the slight is super high and the material is thin, so it's slightly see through.",59021,3
59021,"It would work as a swimsuit cover-up, but I probably won't wear it outside the vicinity of the pool.",59021,3
59022,"looks nice for the price you pay, but the clamp broke off before the first month.",59022,3
59023,"The size was perfect, but the colour of the dress is so dull like a dirty white....",59023,3
59024,Great top but a little too big for me.,59024,3
59024,The bottoms fit perfectly except I'm usually a medium and ordered an extra large after reading the reviews.,59024,3
59025,Looked longer in the photo.,59025,3
59025,Not as fitted as I thought it would be.,59025,3
59026,Keeps falling over in my bag and spilling the contents.,59026,3
59026,Made well and I'm sure it would work in other bags.,59026,3
59026,It needs to fit snugly in your bag to work.,59026,3
59027,I didn't know the fur part is detachable but I like it.,59027,3
59027,the only thing that bothers me is how much it sheds it's ridiculous.,59027,3
59027,It will get all on the coat and whatever else you're wearing so be mindful and carry a lint roller with you when wearing this coat.,59027,3
59028,"Smaller than expected, not very long I have a short torso and it still shows my belly when I raise my arms.",59028,3
59029,Arrived faster than expected and chain is great length!!!,59029,3
59029,However dandelion seeds are hard to make out inside the necklace itself.,59029,3
59030,It looks just like the picture.,59030,3
59030,"I'm generally an XS-S and I got an S hoping it would fall a little low and I was right, it's just slightly loose and incredibly comfortable.",59030,3
59030,The negatives are that the alien was smudged and when I opened the bag it came in there was a thick paint-like smell that hasn't really gone away.,59030,3
59031,"im a large and i bought a 2xl and it was still too small, product is nice and it arrived on time and i will buy from seller again just a 3xl this time",59031,3
59033,I assumed it was cotton :(  Aside from that the shirt is fine.,59033,3
59034,Works well if there is no wind.,59034,3
59034,Wanted it for kayaking and it's just too windy for that activity.,59034,3
59034,The size of the umbrella is big.,59034,3
59035,"The fabric of the shorts is a bit stiff and the pockets are cheap, loud material.",59035,3
59036,It feels big but still looks nice.,59036,3
59037,The shirt is pretty and I really like it.,59037,3
59037,It is a good quality.,59037,3
59037,The only issue is the size is about 5 sizes too small.,59037,3
59037,"I purchased the 3X size, which I normally wear XL, and the shirt is still about 2 sizes too small for me.",59037,3
59037,Make sure to purchase a much larger size than you normally wear.,59037,3
59037,I gave it to a friend who is smaller than me.,59037,3
59038,I got a large because I am an American medium.,59038,3
59038,"The large is a little too big, but I'm going to keep it and make a few alterations.",59038,3
59039,"1 of the gloves thumb hole is basically non usable, can't seem to get the thumb in there.",59039,3
59039,"Looked at the glove, couldn't figure if it's the angle of the gloves thumb or what.",59039,3
59039,But not the best gloves I've purchased,59039,3
59040,"This item was very attractive, however, I had to return it because it was NOT 18 gauge.",59040,3
59041,"Came too late,but would recoment it.",59041,3
59042,Cute shirt but too wide for my frame,59042,3
59043,Didn't really like the material,59043,3
59044,"Cute colors, like the bows but the fabric was a little thin.",59044,3
59044,"OK for the price, I bought several pairs in different colors, that was the selling point for me.",59044,3
59046,Scales on bottom lost color after only one swim.,59046,3
59046,My daughter absolutely loves it and has gotten lots of compliments.,59046,3
59046,Sad the color has dulled out on the bottom already.,59046,3
59047,"I got the size they recommended, but the material is so cheap that they don't fit so good.",59047,3
59047,I don't even wear them.,59047,3
59048,Nice shirt just expected 3/4 sleeves like the picture but it's long sleeve.,59048,3
59049,How do I return this!,59049,3
59049,Way too small even though she just a year old.,59049,3
59049,There is no receipt in the package and definitely not worth $29.99 plus tax.,59049,3
59049,Please let me know how or where to return this teeny tiny dolls dress,59049,3
59050,too small for the wedding i was going to- Could have probably gone with a size for two larger.,59050,3
59052,The top is big for a size 10 and the bottoms are fine,59052,3
59053,I loved how the glasses looked.,59053,3
59053,"But when they got to me, they were covered in tiny scratches, so I couldn't see with them on.",59053,3
59053,I'm sure the product is great when they come intact.,59053,3
59054,Haven't worn it yet...it feels cheap but I'm interested to see how it wears.,59054,3
59054,"It isn't flat as appearing in the picture, the top of the necklace rests against the neck like a chocker.",59054,3
59055,I had an interview at a company whose colors are navy and gold and needed this in a pinch.,59055,3
59055,The colors are great and true to what they appear in the description.,59055,3
59055,"It definitely feels cheap, but most people won't know except for you.",59055,3
59055,I will say that the fabric is very slippery and so knots don't always stay quite as taut as I'd like.,59055,3
59055,But it's good in a pinch.,59055,3
59056,"It's OK, It does seem a bit cheaply made, like you bought it at a discount store.",59056,3
59058,The hat was good but I recommend the trucker hat style of it because it seems like a better material,59058,3
59059,"very boxy, ran smaller than on model",59059,3
59060,As pictured was what I received.,59060,3
59061,It looks nice but wish it had some cotton in it for breathablity.,59061,3
59062,"I normally wear an XS, I ordered a S, but it was still too tight for me to be comfortable in it.",59062,3
59062,It is spandex and it hugs .,59062,3
59062,"I think it is really nice, but I did find it also a bit sheer for my liking.",59062,3
59062,"I ordered the Mint color, my undergarment showed through way to clearly in this, along with my ribs.",59062,3
59062,"I love the styling, the color, but the fit wasn't what I was looking for.",59062,3
59063,I like these but they are tight.,59063,3
59064,A lot bigger than I thought and the strings fall out of the tassels continually.,59064,3
59064,But looks nice clipped to my bag.,59064,3
59065,Cute sweater for a teen,59065,3
59066,I loved the shoes and they do look very cute.,59066,3
59066,"Unfortunately, just after a few times of my daughter wearing them, they ripped.",59066,3
59066,All the little stones fell off and the whole sure is falling apart.,59066,3
59067,"Color is completely wrong...looks mint or light green in the picture, is actually light blue, I needed light green for work so was very disappointed when realized.",59067,3
59067,Otherwise it fits nicely and is very airy and light.,59067,3
59067,Wish the colors listed were true to product.,59067,3
59068,Definitely order two to three sizes larger than what you normally wear.,59068,3
59069,Nice color and not expensive.,59069,3
59069,"But, I ordered a large and it's too big, with no support for large breasts.",59069,3
59069,"Material is too thin, so the built-in bra doesn't work.",59069,3
59069,May work better for small-chested women.,59069,3
59069,"I would also recommend to order a size down, as these stretch.",59069,3
59070,"I order this jumpsuit in Large, but its too tight",59070,3
59071,I am not sure if I somehow missed the part where the entire back is sheer see through black fabric or what but I was hoping for a cover up not something see through.,59071,3
59071,It fits as expected and delivery was on the day it said it would be in time for my trip.,59071,3
59071,"Seems to be made good, I'll find out how it holds up this next weekend.",59071,3
59072,Very weird thick fabric...almost rubbery.,59072,3
59073,Somewhat short in the crouch for me .,59073,3
59074,cut small at waist,59074,3
59075,Worked for swim cover up.,59075,3
59075,When it was washed it shrunk a LOT.,59075,3
59075,Be careful of sizing.,59075,3
59075,Go up at least one size.,59075,3
59076,"Cute and loose, but pretty short and extremely see through.....",59076,3
59077,I'm wondering if this was a return item.,59077,3
59077,2 of the lights were pulled out and it actually had a mix of batteries in it like someone was scrounging to find 2 batteries.,59077,3
59077,I bought it as a fun joke for next Christmas -- now I wonder if its been worn and not washed.,59077,3
59077,"It's showing I can wash the sweater, but no instructions as to taking out and replacing the lights and I guess the lights and batteries can't go into water!",59077,3
59077,This is the first product I've purchased from Amazon that I've been disappointed in!,59077,3
59078,Kit fit my penis in it,59078,3
59079,Bought this Burei watch for my wife for her birthday.,59079,3
59079,She loved the watch at first sight.,59079,3
59079,"We both have Burei watches and for the price, I believe is a good buy.",59079,3
59080,Wish the long back came around the body more .needs clip to keep front parts together or it feels like it is going to fall off.,59080,3
59080,Buy for the look as  that is all you wear it for .Would like it to be thicker to use as a coat.,59080,3
59081,The product was a totally different swimsuit .,59081,3
59082,They were just too large - I tried to exchange them for a Medium but they didn't have any - nly Small.,59082,3
59083,"Legs were longer than the 32' stated, otherwise fits well.",59083,3
59083,"Thinner material than I expected, but will still work great once I put a small stitch near the ankles.",59083,3
59085,"Solid and wonderful, only issue I've had with them is the rubber o-rings fell off in a matter of a week, just a little too loose.",59085,3
59085,I just bought some 14 gauge rubber o-rings and I have had no issues since.,59085,3
59086,It looks like an old man shirt not like the picture  I bought it for my bf but I gave it to my dad instead because it looks like a 40 yr olds Hawaiian shirt haha also it's more red than pink like in the photo,59086,3
59087,"The fabric is on the thinner side but very soft; as plus size 14-16 clothing quality is important to keep
 Smooth and keep all together.",59087,3
59088,I will have to lose weight to fit into it,59088,3
59089,"I am 5'8, 195 pounds, and 38DDD.",59089,3
59089,I ordered the XXL.,59089,3
59089,The dress fit well but by the end of the night  I had to keep putting the dress back on my shoulders.,59089,3
59089,Other than that the dress is very pretty.,59089,3
59090,This top fits okay in the chest area.,59090,3
59090,There is NO support holding those puppies in though.,59090,3
59090,That could be problematic lol.,59090,3
59090,The waste area fits nice.,59090,3
59090,I'm a big girl and it didn't hug my fat.,59090,3
59090,Two things I dislike: it comes with a single halter strap.,59090,3
59090,Its not adjustable and pulls my head downward even with no pull from the chest area.,59090,3
59090,"And the side tie is aesthetic, not functional.",59090,3
59090,I would be leery wearing it without the halter strap.,59090,3
59090,The bottoms fit great.,59090,3
59090,Comfortable without being too big or too restricting.,59090,3
59091,Fits a big and a little strange.,59091,3
59093,Not sexy but cool,59093,3
59094,"look nice,but broke apart in a week with just normal wear...too bad cause they look nice!",59094,3
59095,The bar was pretty flexible but one of the balls broke.,59095,3
59095,NOT good for new piercings!!!,59095,3
59095,Especially not good for new diath piercings.,59095,3
59096,"I ordered my normal size and they were too big... For reference I have a 25""w and 35"" hips ... Not that I could actually properly try them on as they had NO button hole openigs!",59096,3
59096,"I know I could easily open them myself with s knife, but I'm not sure I should have to.. Aside from that they were actually ok shorts, and I would return them anyway aside from the size and buttons because they aren't as high up on the waist as I'd expected",59096,3
59097,To big and it is see through!!,59097,3
59097,I'm 163 and 5'6!!!!,59097,3
59097,"No buttock and it was big on me , I purchased black and it is nice , if u don't mind see through !",59097,3
59097,I got a refund and it did not have a tag on it as it was new,59097,3
59098,"Cute, but not the best quality.",59098,3
59099,"Just received my corset yesterday, of course I couldn't wait to try on.",59099,3
59099,"First thing I noticed was it wasn't as heavy as the waist cincher I  bought a year ago,also it has less bones,the fabric is thinner.",59099,3
59099,Still looks well made though.,59099,3
59099,"Once I ""season"" it I'LL write more.",59099,3
59100,"At first I thought ""these are great"" but then after awhile they started bothering the outer right side of my foot so I took them out.",59100,3
59100,It feels at times like I am walking with a small golf ball under my foot in the middle to the outer right side.,59100,3
59100,I will try and get use to them since the Podiatrist recommended them.,59100,3
59102,"Again, This is a great product and my son loves it, however, the battery unit plate is flawed.",59102,3
59102,"instead of having two screws to keep the batteries securely inside of it, it only has one.",59102,3
59102,"As a result, the batteries, when whacked around by my son, the batteries knock up against the plate and cause the batteries and the plate to be pushed out of position.",59102,3
59103,"These socks are absolutely adorable, but they do run very small.",59103,3
59103,"Granted my daughter has long feet, but she got these at 2.5 months and they're too small.",59103,3
59103,"I came back and ordered up a size, so hopefully those will fit for a while.",59103,3
59104,The art work on the band is fading away,59104,3
59105,this product comes too small unfortunately i cant use it,59105,3
59106,This shirt does not fit as expected.,59106,3
59106,I ordered this because my husband wanted it for Christmas unfortunately it's too tight.,59106,3
59106,It basicly clings to his body.,59106,3
59106,I also had to wait awhile to receive this.,59106,3
59106,I would return it but being that it's from a 3rd party seller I feel it would be to difficult.,59106,3
59106,As long as you don't mind shirts clinging to your body then this isn't a bad buy.,59106,3
59107,"Larch Comes open occasionally, but does not fall off",59107,3
59108,It's smaller than I expected it to be.,59108,3
59108,It is pretty good quality though!,59108,3
59110,The coloring isn't quite what I wanted when I thought I was getting green.,59110,3
59110,The buttons are cheap looking.,59110,3
59110,I might change them to something less shiny.,59110,3
59111,"Pieces are little and hard to put together since you have to ""create the look"" yourself.",59111,3
59112,Not Comfortable at all.,59112,3
59112,But makes your Butt Look Nice!!!,59112,3
59113,My son normally wears a 2....I ordered a 2 and it barely fit.,59113,3
59113,Otherwise a nice slide!,59113,3
59114,"Said 10-13, was size below this.",59114,3
59116,"I loved these earrings as the style they are perfect for me, but I was hoping that they wouldn't tarnish.",59116,3
59116,"After a couple of wears, they did, even though I made sure to take them out during showers and other activities.",59116,3
59117,It came in a dark blue color,59117,3
59118,i've been buying these every time i size up but i only got two pairs.,59118,3
59119,"Received the product,shirt is okay though the short is very small, must have sent wrong size of shorts.",59119,3
59120,"Sleeves aren't long enough, hoods too big.",59120,3
59120,Makes it look awkward when it's on you.,59120,3
59121,ordered xl not like the picture!!,59121,3
59121,smaller than normal xl,59121,3
59122,"I would agree with everyone that this is not a dress you could wear by itself, it needs leggings.",59122,3
59122,"I should have listed to other reviews since I am big chested, but i didn't, and I ordered a small.",59122,3
59122,"If you have a smaller chest then a small will work, but if you're top heavy like me it will pull across your chest and look bad.",59122,3
59122,"I'm 5'2, 109lbs, and a 32DD.",59122,3
59122,"But with that being said, the material itself is very durable and good quality, it just sadly didn't fit my chest :(",59122,3
59123,This shirt runs extremely small!!,59123,3
59123,I bought an XL for my average size 16 year old son and it was too small.,59123,3
59123,He was only able to wear it once.,59123,3
59123,Order 2 or 3 times the size needed.,59123,3
59124,Found it to be pretty poor quality.,59124,3
59124,"Very thin fabric, faded enormously on first wash.",59124,3
59124,Doesn't hold shape well.,59124,3
59124,Just not much to these.,59124,3
59124,I guess it's not too far off based on price but I wouldn't purchase again.,59124,3
59128,I purchased the Lacey Opal Septum Ring in Purple and as soon as I got it I was in love.,59128,3
59128,This ring is absolutely gorgeous!,59128,3
59128,I received compliments everywhere I went.,59128,3
59128,It wasn't too large in size and fit nicely in my piercing and was proportionate for my face.,59128,3
59128,One of the best things about this ring is it stays put.,59128,3
59128,"It was rather difficult to remove, but for me that is a definite plus.",59128,3
59128,I find too often clickers become undone very easily and the hinge mechanism wears out within the first couple of months.,59128,3
59128,That is not the case with this ring.,59128,3
59128,"I am giving this ring 3 stars because while this ring is SUPER cute and stays in place so well, the opal in my ring fell out after a week of wearing it.",59128,3
59128,"Which is very frustrating and may speak to a bad individual ring or a design flaw, I cannot say either way.",59128,3
59129,I ordered this for Vegas it's sexy the material was enough to wrap around but I am fairly top-heavy so moving around or not having double-sided tape would be a no no I was able to tie it a couple of different ways but overall the swimsuits not for swimming unless you buy it in a dark color because the moment water hits it is completely transparent,59129,3
59130,Nice but decal is a little foggy,59130,3
59131,Was able to where it while hosting a party and swim without stepping away to change.,59131,3
59131,It is comfortable and modest.,59131,3
59131,My only complaint is that the colors bled.,59131,3
59131,The red and the blue were in the white stripes.,59131,3
59131,Spraying it with spray and wash stain remover helped a little bit but the white isn't as white anymore it is tainted with the other colors.,59131,3
59131,The straps have a blue tint.,59131,3
59131,I would buy again but I would wash it differently.,59131,3
59132,Not too sure of this one - great material and well made but the fit is off.,59132,3
59132,"Not very flattering, more of a flowy look, I would order 2 sizes smaller and would probably fit perfect!",59132,3
59133,Really nice pants but I used 5 the next size and still king of small,59133,3
59134,"but when I went to return them, the company offered to send me back 1/2 the cost.",59134,3
59134,"which was great, ...so I kept them, but still haven't worn because they are thin and clingy.",59134,3
59135,for beginners it is ok....,59135,3
59136,Cheap as expected for the price but I don't mind these falling and breaking which is what I wanted.,59136,3
59137,Not quite like the picture.,59137,3
59138,Top dial is lose.,59138,3
59138,Other than that it's OK watch for the price,59138,3
59139,Looks like it will wear well.,59139,3
59140,It's definitely not true to size...,59140,3
59141,"It's ok, thought it would fit more off the shoulder like the picture, more of a shirt fit",59141,3
59142,It's okay for my daughter..,59142,3
59145,"I wasn't expecting much for a $4 dollar bra, but I wanted one with a cool design in the back.",59145,3
59145,"I'm a 34A, and the bra padding itself is removable and surprisingly really nice.",59145,3
59145,"For me, the bust is a little big, but the material is comfortable/stretchy and it doesn't really matter.",59145,3
59145,"However, the embroidery in the back is awkwardly loose and doesn't lay flat against your back.",59145,3
59145,"In the picture, too, you can kinda tell that some the strings are loose-ish, and I don't think it's because of size.",59145,3
59145,"I probably wouldn't wear it with an open back top, but if you need a cheap bra with nice padding, here's one.",59145,3
59145,"(It also came in 3 weeks early, so that was cool)",59145,3
59146,It is a cute dress but the top part (at the boobs) isn't what I expected.,59146,3
59146,"Also, after one wash the color was different.",59146,3
59146,This isn't my favorite style and I won't get this kind of dress again.,59146,3
59147,Very flat frames and not as hot pink in person.,59147,3
59147,They came a little bent but they will do .,59147,3
59148,Arrived with scratches on it but I like the design.,59148,3
59150,"This is an attractive swim suit, but I gave it 3 stars because the top is too small and there is not enough support unless you are not too well endowed in that area.",59150,3
59150,"then it would be an attractive, sexy swim suit.",59150,3
59150,"However, I think that most plus size women have healthy breasts and would need better support.",59150,3
59150,The material is comfortable and is a beautiful color.,59150,3

59151,Returning runs smaller than expected,59151,3
59152,Shirt looks great but the hole for your head/shoulders isn't quite big enough for my shoulders to fit the way in the picture.,59152,3
59153,A little bit flimsy,59153,3
59154,This fit as expected but there was a hole in it around the hip.,59154,3
59154,I did not try to return b/c I didn't want to go through the hassle.,59154,3
59155,Sadly returned this beautiful bag.,59155,3
59155,It was a little bigger than I wanted.,59155,3
59156,"For the price, they are nice.",59156,3
59156,The earrings are a little heavy.,59156,3
59156,I can use the silver necklace for other pieces of jewelry.,59156,3
59157,"Looks nice, but photo doesn't properly represent the real thing.",59157,3
59157,"Real small, not so flexible.",59157,3
59157,"I still use it, it looks OK",59157,3
59158,I'm giving 3 stars just because it's a cute dress the size run too small I got size 3-4 years and it's just fit 1-2 years I'm going to keep it and give to someone as a gift.,59158,3
59159,Bracelet does not buckle and I'm afraid to wear it because it will fall off.,59159,3
59159,It is a pretty bracelet though.,59159,3
59160,My son loves these (9 years old) but by the end of the day they are very stretched out due to the material type.,59160,3
59160,They are soft & comfortable but definitely lose their shape the longer they're worn.,59160,3
59160,The shape comes right back after washing & drying.,59160,3
59160,I wish there were size options.,59160,3
59161,Product was delivered fast but have to say was very disappointed that one of the sets was very much off color shown to the point of the set not even matching.,59161,3
59161,It was the red pants w stars and the blue elephant shirt.,59161,3
59161,The pant were supposed to have white stars on them and they were gold stars which don't match the top at all.,59161,3
59161,These sets are comfortable I use them for around the house and pjs for now.,59161,3
59161,The material is ok for outdoor in spring and fall but not winter to thin.,59161,3
59161,I have also notice the the strings in the pants waist falls out very easy.,59161,3
59161,I probably will buy more bc they are cute.,59161,3
59161,I just hope all the other ones are true to colors I like things to match,59161,3
59163,The only problem was it was too small to go over her head - she is 4.,59163,3
59163,Had to restring it so she would be able to wear.,59163,3
59164,Its larger than I expected but it looks okay.,59164,3
59164,The stones are very bright with some being quite large.,59164,3
59164,"Some of the  stones don't seem to be anchored very well, so I won't be surprised if they fall out.",59164,3
59164,There is a fabric backing behind the stones and a ribbon tie is used instead of the usual chain and clasp.,59164,3
59164,"There was one peculiar thing, it had a strange, strong smell coming from it which seemed to be  from the fabric backing.",59164,3
59164,I left it out in the open for a  few days to see if  the smell would go away.,59164,3
59164,"It did somewhat, but you can still detect a trace of it.",59164,3
59164,Not crazy about this particular necklace.,59164,3
59165,ONLY THE TOP HALF OF MY TREE FIT?,59165,3
59165,BOO -NICE MATERIAL THOUGH AND LOVED THE WHEELS -GAVE IT TO SOMEONE WITH A SMALLER TREE.,59165,3
59167,Order way up in size.,59167,3
59167,"I normally wear a large shirt, but after reading reviews I decided to order XXL because I wanted a loose fit.",59167,3
59167,It's a good thing I did this because XXL barely fit.,59167,3
59167,"I was hoping for something less constraining for the beach, but at least it wasn't too tight.",59167,3
59167,I ordered two of these and the white one came with a couple missing buttons.,59167,3
59168,"cute, order 1-2 sizes up, I wear a 8 so I got a 9 & it's still snug on my feet, idk if it's the foam or what but I hope it wear dwn sum...",59168,3
59169,My six year old is in the 10th percentile for height and weight and this leotard still fit snugly.,59169,3
59169,The skirt is separate from the leotard so keep that in mind because you cannot make the skirt any smaller.,59169,3
59169,"There should be a hole to pass the ribbon through for small waists, but there is not.",59169,3
59169,"Therefore, her skirt falls off all the time.",59169,3
59170,"I want to give 5 stars...I bought the gray one, loved it.",59170,3
59170,That's why I ordered 2 more in other colors.,59170,3
59170,"Sadly, the black has a thick strange collar that the gray did not.",59170,3
59170,I can use it at home because it looks strange... for yard work.,59170,3
59170,I wear the gray to work and get tons of compliments.,59170,3
59170,The green is coming today...,59170,3
59170,I hope it's not like the black.,59170,3
59170,"Green came, the shoulder and bottom hem had rips.",59170,3
59170,Also it is not green...teal or light turquoise would be the correct term.,59170,3
59171,"This is a light to medium weight sweater, not the best quality, but adequate.",59171,3
59171,"It is hard to find a clean, simple cardigan with pockets that does not add extra bulk when not needed.",59171,3
59171,I like my sweaters just a bit roomy.,59171,3
59171,"I use this at work when the office gets cool from the air conditioning, or under a jacket in the winter.",59171,3
59171,I wear a size 18 and extra large fit well.,59171,3
59171,"I bought two, one in gray and one in black.",59171,3
59171,The material is a bit stiff.,59171,3
59171,The arm seams in the black one pulled apart after one wearing.,59171,3
59171,But my elbows wore through in a couple months.,59171,3
59171,Would have liked the sweaters to last a bit longer.,59171,3
59173,It looks like the picture and its very cute.,59173,3
59173,"It does run a lil small I ordered a size Large but was sent a size XL, I'm 5'5"" 155lbs tall athletic, let me say the bottoms fit great but the elastic that goes around you (not the staps) was really lose so I will have to just take in a tad and the freaken straps themselves were not sewed!!!",59173,3
59173,So therefore I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 lol,59173,3
59174,Not as convenient as I had hoped...only one zipper pocket inside ...no slots for credit cards...just open spaces...so not great for oranizing unless you want to put a wallet inside.,59174,3
59175,I ordered this in the exact size foot i am but one size smaller.,59175,3
59175,But for my foot it was still to big.,59175,3
59175,So i just gave it to my best friend.,59175,3
59175,She said it was comfortable and you could wear it all day.,59175,3
59175,If this fit me I know id agree with her.,59175,3
59176,The jumpsuit is made with a different material than I expected but it still fits me okay.,59176,3
59176,It's a little tighter than I wanted and maybe needed to order a size up due to the construction of the piece.,59176,3
59177,One pair was broken upon arrival.,59177,3
59177,"They are cheap and cheaply made, but can't expect alot for the cost here.",59177,3
59177,Product is just OK.,59177,3
59178,The cups are small.,59178,3
59178,"I was professionally measured, so I know what size I wear.",59178,3
59178,"It was excellent, except the cups are tight.",59178,3
59179,"The post says to order three sizes up; I normally wear a small, so I ordered a large, and it's a little baggy.",59179,3
59179,"Also, there's a weird black and orange star applique on the back of mine.",59179,3
59180,After 5 months the stone will fall out on its own.,59180,3
59180,I don't shower with it but my boyfriend showers with his and it hasn't changed color.,59180,3
59180,I guess I can glue my stone back in,59180,3
59181,ok but not what i liked,59181,3
59182,A bit smaller than I expected,59182,3
59183,"The jewelry is very pretty, but is roughly finished.",59183,3
59183,"I snagged a new cardigan :(, and had to pull off one piece that was loose on another bracelet.",59183,3
59183,I think I probably could have done better elsewhere.,59183,3
59185,Very nicely made although totally sheer.,59185,3
59185,I normally wear a large but ordered an XXL.,59185,3
59185,"Nonetheless, I couldn't get shirt over my arms which are a little bigger than normal size for a large.",59185,3
59185,Be carely as it runs small.,59185,3
59186,FIT WASN'T AS DESCRIBED.,59186,3
59187,The lace picks really bad!,59187,3
59187,It picks on anything!,59187,3
59188,its good for price but very small and not sturdy,59188,3
59189,This dress runs large.,59189,3
59189,The front the neckline is also too low for me to wear comfortably.,59189,3
59189,The size small fits more like a size S/M.,59189,3
59189,The neckline is not modest and if you need any coverage over there I would not recommend this dress.,59189,3
59190,"Comfortable sock, but I was disappointed with the colors.",59190,3
59190,All of the colors look much more faded then the ones shown in the picture.,59190,3
59190,The reds are more of a pink,59190,3
59191,Hat came in crushed and completely mistreated.,59191,3
59191,"Form is off, but overall the design of the hat is nice.",59191,3
59192,doesn't look anything like picture,59192,3
59194,very thin and transparent,59194,3
59195,But is much heavier and thicker than I thought it would be.,59195,3
59195,Size runs a little bigger than my other size 7.,59195,3
59196,One size fits all???,59196,3
59196,It needs to be adjustable.,59196,3
59197,"Purchased the XL versions , my ""2 veg"" get split by the string/thong part of these.",59197,3
59197,"My ""meat"" part fits however it took some gentle stretching of the material to make that happen.",59197,3
59197,"They are comfortable enough , I did not wear these with pants so I am not sure they would be good for anything other than around the house, I figure that the ""splitting"" of the ""2 veg"" may make chaffing an issue in pants.",59197,3
59197,"Amusing concept, not sure the sizing is right though, order a size up if possible.",59197,3
59198,"Had to return, looked great but not enough support.",59198,3
59199,"Cut really small, looks a little on the cheap side but at the price it is something usable and not worth returning.",59199,3
59200,The tabs in the back to adjust the straps are very uncomfortable.,59200,3
59200,The seem like they would be better in the front or set up differently.,59200,3
59200,I have slept in this 3 times and each time i ended up with marks in my back from the straps and it kind of hurt.,59200,3
59200,"It is very, very pretty.",59200,3
59200,Nice to wear around for fun or cool evening wear not good to sleep in,59200,3
59201,I really wanted to like this set because it is really very pretty.,59201,3
59201,"Unfortunately, the workmanship is so poor that a stone fell out of an earring the very first time my wife tried it on.",59201,3
59201,So back it went to Amazon.,59201,3
59202,I am giving this suit three stars because it is identical to what's pictured however it runs really small.,59202,3
59202,I wear a medium but over-estimated and got a large just in case.,59202,3
59202,"Well, even the large fit poorly.",59202,3
59202,"I am athletic build, 150lbs and am 5'7"".",59202,3
59202,I could barely pull it's straps over my shoulders.,59202,3
59202,It also gave me a massive wedgy.,59202,3
59202,I just knew I would be able to fit this based off of previous reviews but was left disappointed.,59202,3
59203,This tank top was a bit too big.,59203,3
59203,I ordered it in grey in a small but it is not tight on me and is actually a bit baggy which is weird because I'm usually a medium in tops.,59203,3
59203,The design wraps around the front which makes it hard to see because of my breasts.,59203,3
59203,It is very cute still and I do wear it often.,59203,3
59203,Really like the open back and the short length.,59203,3
59203,"Wouldn't buy again, but won't return.",59203,3
59205,didn't fit too small cu I usually buy this size....had to return,59205,3
59206,Fabric feels like terry cloth.,59206,3
59206,"Cute, its ok if you like a thin sweatshirt, maybe for summer.",59206,3
59207,I loved the look of this purse.,59207,3
59207,"But beware, in person, it looks cheap as it is made with very cheap material.",59207,3
59207,"Also, regarding the gun compartment, it's a hassle because the Velcro gets in the way with large handguns.",59207,3
59207,I have a Springfield XD-9 subcompact that's about 6.5x5 inches with a Crimson Trace laser on it.,59207,3
59207,This gun does not fit.,59207,3
59207,"Basic idea here is, cute purse for women who like loud things who aren't girlie and have an eclectic side with tacky or gaudy taste (lol), buuut..I would not recommend this particular purse.",59207,3
59208,"It's flimsy fabric, and the back is very awkwardly made.",59208,3
59209,Material is nice but I don't like the snaps.,59209,3
59209,They are spaced out way too far apart and you can clearly see the baby's diaper.,59209,3
59210,I like it but I wanted the same color as the picture but it came in purple,59210,3
59211,The top is to loose and bottom to small.,59211,3
59212,This coat does run small.,59212,3
59212,It is a nice design.,59212,3
59212,But it is more like a fleece jacket.,59212,3
59213,"I like it, just kind of sits weird on the shoulders.",59213,3
59215,This top came quickly and in good condition.,59215,3
59215,It was packaged rolled up in a small bag so it was quite wrinkles.,59215,3
59215,You do need to be skinny for this type of shirt otherwise it will look like a tent.,59215,3
59215,I'm not as skinny as the girl in the picture and I have a large chest so I feel like I'm on the fence of it looking good.,59215,3
59215,"Also, its shear so I have to layer it.",59215,3
59216,The material was of good quality ....I wear size large and I purchased a XXL it was still too small...,59216,3
59217,"It was really pretty, fabric was not see-through but way too small in the bust for me and if I go up in size, rest will be too big so unfortunately I have to return.",59217,3
59217,I ordered a small and I am a 34-d and 5'3,59217,3
59218,The bracelet I received looks nothing like the picture.,59218,3
59218,The beads are red and green only the adornments are lovely but never so lively as the picture.,59218,3
59218,it's dark and dull.,59218,3
59219,"Pretty buy also pretty big
Hard to put on",59219,3
59220,A bit on the flimsy side...when it stretches it becomes almost tissue paper transparent in appearance.,59220,3
59220,"It's being used under a corset, so that's not a problem, but I'd only use it as under corset wear.",59220,3
59221,"The coat was shorter than expected,  the color was not as expected, and the coat was a little snug.",59221,3
59221,The coat was returned.,59221,3
59222,"It's beige, it's not American sizes so be careful.",59222,3
59223,Wife loved the top.,59223,3
59223,She said the bottoms and straps were a little tight.,59223,3
59223,"She is 5'8"" and if she were a couple of inches shorter the bottoms probably would have been ok.",59223,3
59225,The earrings are very pretty.,59225,3
59225,However it is difficult to put the backing on the earring when it is in my earlobe.,59225,3
59226,"The item size runs small, it says Fits Natural Waist 33""-35"" but there is no way, I am a natural 34"".",59226,3
59226,Anyway I gave it 3 stars because it is well made and a very pretty corset.,59226,3
59226,Just watch the sizing when purchasing.,59226,3
59227,Dress is to small will have to return it .,59227,3
59227,The dress doesn't come in a larger size,59227,3
59228,The color is vibrant in the photo.,59228,3
59228,..after receiving it ...looked washed  out.....,59228,3
59229,"I was extremely disappointed to find out It is for only 1 earring, I assumed it was for 2 because of the word set.",59229,3
59229,"I ordered a 2nd one, and I am wearing them as regular earrings.",59229,3
59229,"They are small but pretty, the post length is about the same as a normal earring.",59229,3
59230,The product is pictured as blue/aqua and it is actually a lime green.,59230,3
59230,The colors are not represented correctly as pictured.,59230,3
59230,It is of decent quality but they did not picture the rear of the suit and now i know why; it is a Brazilian cut.,59230,3
59230,I will wear the top and just pair it with a solid bottom.,59230,3
59230,It was worth the money for the top.,59230,3
59231,"This is a cute bikini set, standard black top and bottom had rich color.",59231,3
59231,"Material is thick, but when you get in the water, it seems to expand a bit and all of it was a little ""stretched or droopy.""",59231,3
59231,"If you are just chilling by the pool and do not plan to get in, it is fine.",59231,3
59232,Strong but had to be tweeked a little in order to close and lock consistently.,59232,3
59232,All in all it does the job of keeping my cards secure.,59232,3
59233,"This soft and lovely scarf arrived sans the mentioned ""key-ring.""",59233,3
59233,I gave it to a friend who wears more scarves than I do.,59233,3
59233,"It took over a month to arrive, which interfered with my plans to use it  s a Christmas gift.",59233,3
59233,Why does this take so long to get to0 me?,59233,3
59233,No one had an answer for that.,59233,3
59233,"That said, this is a beautiful scarf and well worth the excessively long wait.",59233,3
59234,Super cute... but when I got them the holes for the buttons were swen up so I had to punch through them with a knife... but great after that,59234,3
59235,"Nice dress, but runs very, very small.",59235,3
59235,"I am a size 16 or XL, and I ordered size XXL, but it was too small, and I had to return it.",59235,3
59236,This seems like a great idea but doesn't work for me at all.,59236,3
59236,I purchased this to keep from losing my rings while swimming.,59236,3
59236,"As soon as my hand got wet, the medium cover and my rings slid right off my finger.",59236,3
59236,So I tried the smallest cover and had the same result.,59236,3
59236,The small cover was a struggle to get on.,59236,3
59236,"But once on, it was stretched out and also slid right off my finger when wet.",59236,3
59236,I can see that this cover might protect your rings from scratches.,59236,3
59236,"But any liquid, lotion, or soap will still get into it.",59236,3
59236,"And once stretched over your rings, it does not hug your finger.",59236,3
59236,Oh I wish it worked!,59236,3
59236,I recommend the cover that is just a black stretchy spandex band that slips over your finger,59236,3
59238,Somewhat small and light stretchy cheap material,59238,3
59239,"pretty, but a large is not a large, I'm a 32 DDD and this was a definite no",59239,3
59240,"Very flattering in the body, except it runs a little small on the torso area.",59240,3
59240,"I ordered a medium being that it's my average size, I'm 5'0 weighing at 103 lbs.",59240,3
59240,"yet I still had trouble getting it to pull over my shoulders, again, it runs small length wise.",59240,3
59240,I'd strongly recommend you order a size up unless you feel you have a smallish torso.,59240,3
59240,"Other than that, the material was in perfect bathing suit material, I received lots of compliments, and color and image provided was true.",59240,3
59240,I ordered a L in black this time (I currently have the red) and hope it will fit better.,59240,3
59240,"I do recommend others to buy it, just be aware if the torso fitting!",59240,3
59241,Trendy and all but not really made well.,59241,3
59241,The edges are pretty flimsy and don't stay flat.,59241,3
59241,They curl in random ways.,59241,3
59241,Thinking about taking it the cleaners so the can Starch and press it.,59241,3
59242,Looks a little cheap and as if the earrings might brake any minute.,59242,3
59242,but if it holds up for the day then I guess it'll be what I paid for.,59242,3
59242,I might have to bring some super glue with me to my wedding just in case!,59242,3
59243,I gave the dress away to my sister.,59243,3
59243,It was not the same material as expected.,59243,3
59243,But it looked nice on her,59243,3
59244,kind of thin but its a pretty color and flows well,59244,3
59245,Good material but it was HUGE on me.,59245,3
59245,Gave it as a gift to my (bigger) friend and he loves it!,59245,3
59246,I like it but it is a bit thin and I don't feel comfortable wearing it out much because I feel like I'm showing my nipples.,59246,3
59246,Not sure why it's so hard to find an American flag one-piece so it's good enough for me to keep and just wear in my backyard or friends.,59246,3
59247,Nice bag as far as size goes but flat as an envelope so very difficult to  actually put anything into it.,59247,3
59247,I don't carry a lot but still this is difficult.,59247,3
59247,If you don't carry anything much this might work.,59247,3
59248,It was ok.order a size up,59248,3
59249,"The dress style is very cute, but the fabric is very thin and somewhat aee through..size is slightly small.",59249,3
59250,It's elegant but the fabric is too light,59250,3
59252,"Bought this for my wife as Christmas present, She likes the design, but its pretty expensive for a cheap, thin T-shirt.",59252,3
59253,Good Quality but my normal 3x size was too small.,59253,3
59254,"Ok, not the best out there, but you get a good quality for the price.",59254,3
59255,I was a little disappointed i got alot of plain tonuge rings as well as eye brow rings other then that i liked the jewelry just didn't expect to het plain metal tonuge rings that ill never use.,59255,3
59256,"This little tote is a very nice color, but looks alot cheaper than the photo shown, but then again, the item was only about $7.00, so it's fair.",59256,3
59256,It arrived earlier than expected.,59256,3
59257,Too damn small.. Had to return!,59257,3
59258,I bought these as Christmas gifts they're great for beginners to see if you like using essential oils like that but for somebody that wants something for every day this necklace isn't for you,59258,3
59259,It's average just okay.,59259,3
59260,Very pretty but fit a bit large,59260,3
59261,The shoulder straps are too large and the quality is not great,59261,3
59262,I use it everyday and travel with it although I need a larger one now.,59262,3
59262,The ziper pulls come off easily though,59262,3
59264,"Top is very cute, but it's sheer, you definitely have to have an undershirt.",59264,3
59264,"It's snags super easy and I've already got two small snags, and I've only owned it for two weeks.",59264,3
59264,"It does run small, I'd say order at least two sizes bigger then your normal size if you want it flow-y like its pictured.",59264,3
59267,This set is lovely and of great quality.,59267,3
59267,"The reason why i am giving it a 3 stars rating is because it did not bring a chain, only the pendant and earrings and there is no way provide to contact seller to make the claim.",59267,3
59269,"It was smaller than I thought it would be, but still a cute shirt.",59269,3
59269,"The arms are but tighter thsn I would like, but with s little working out and eating right, should fit better.",59269,3
59269,Nice and thin for spring coming up too.,59269,3
59270,Dress is short and tight.,59270,3
59270,Does have elastic waste but not enough give.,59270,3
59270,Would have purchased one size up for a better fit.,59270,3
59270,Colors are vibrant and dress is pretty.,59270,3
59271,I love the style of this shirt but I wish it was a little bit longer (I am 5'11 so finding longer shirts is a struggle for me).,59271,3
59271,The sleeves are nice and long though and they have thumb holes; which I didn't know before purchase and was pleasently suprised about!,59271,3
59271,The front pocket is crooked...,59271,3
59271,I didn't realize it when I purchased but I think it's a cute addition.,59271,3
59272,Very cute but small.,59272,3
59272,I read the previous reviews warning that the top ran small so I ordered up to a large.,59272,3
59272,"I am typically a small/medium, 34DD.",59272,3
59272,Might be ok on someone with a smaller chest.,59272,3
59272,Kept it may give it to a friend.,59272,3
59273,Really cute but it's a sheer dress and the fabric underneath that's supposed to hide all your goodies is a little too short...in the front!,59273,3
59273,So you have to be careful or you might flash someone (full frontal flashing).,59273,3
59273,"Also, the sleeves are a little shorter than I'd like but I tend to have that problem with a lot of tops and dresses, I have long arms.",59273,3
59274,I really wanted to like the yoga pants (leggings) but I don't like how they fit.,59274,3
59274,I ordered a size up since yoga pants seem to fit tighter.,59274,3
59274,I should have ordered 2 sizes up.,59274,3
59274,I like the fabric and I think I would like the look of them if they fit correctly.,59274,3
59275,"These are basically a lesser form of Spanx, providing gentle compression.",59275,3
59275,You aren't supposed to wear them until your incision heals and then it's recommended to wear them every day for 3 months for maximum benefit,59275,3
59276,"If your measurements are 5'2"" and 85 lbs, the shirt will fit like the photo.",59276,3
59276,"Otherwise, it's a nice off the shoulder top.",59276,3
59276,"I'm 5'9"" and 136lbs",59276,3
59278,"This item came promptly, and in nice packaging.",59278,3
59278,"It looks attractive, but the snap clasp will be the first thing to go wrong.",59278,3
59278,It is hard to snap and comes undone easily and is already pulling the leather.,59278,3
59278,But it is a huge upgrade from the dumb metal ones that you can buy almost anywhere.,59278,3
59279,"Cute dress, but definitely a very awkward design.",59279,3
59279,"It fit me from the waist down, but was big up top.",59279,3
59279,I ordered a medium and normally wear a 4 or 6 (32B/34A).Just wasn't made to fit US sizes I think.,59279,3
59280,The magnetic clasp is not as easy to connect if you don't get it just right.,59280,3
59280,In all fairness it does say the bracelet is 7.5 inches but it seems quite small to me.,59280,3
59280,Should have returned it as I prefer looser fit.,59280,3
59281,Do not get wet!,59281,3
59282,extremely bulky... would not buy again,59282,3
59283,the 12 month size is too small for my 6 month old,59283,3
59284,"im usually a 2x i sized down just like the reviews said however, i shouldve gotten an xl i bought a 1x  runs big ..material is light which is good ,,i read other reviews where they said front is long but they stated they were a lot shorter than i am ...i'm 5'6 too long in the front but ill make it work i kept iti ...i shouldve returned it but im going away soon n don't have sufficient time so yea :/",59284,3
59285,It doesn't look identical to the photo but it's still pretty.,59285,3
59285,I'm only wearing it for the wedding ceremony so it's not a big deal.,59285,3
59285,Worth the money though if you're only using it for what I am.,59285,3
59286,"Material is questionable, but it will do just fine for the beach over my swim suit",59286,3
59287,"The ""V"" is not deep enough.",59287,3
59287,"It is more like a ""crew-neck"".",59287,3
59287,Makes it difficult to get  into my shirt pocket.,59287,3
59288,They are hard to use with a mask over the ears.,59288,3
59289,We had to Tailor it ourselves.,59289,3
59289,It was too large.,59289,3
59289,Is a decent dress but be ready to work on it.,59289,3
59289,Shipping was fast after they made it.,59289,3
59290,"I got this as a early Christmas present for my best friend, I expected it to be at least the size of two fingers but it is A LOT smaller than what is shown in the picture.",59290,3
59290,"On top of that it doesn't glow at all, and the chain is easily breakable.",59290,3
59290,3/5 just because my best friend loved the idea of the necklace.,59290,3
59291,"I used these multiple times, but they leave my hands marked in a way I dislike.",59291,3
59292,Not true to size chart.,59292,3
59292,Tight in the hips and stomach.,59292,3
59293,"bought to take to football game, not clear ""enough"" to get through security :(",59293,3
59294,To small but is lovely.,59294,3
59294,I bought a 2X and I'm a size 14 so I was pleased with it.,59294,3
59294,It fits perfectly but is slightly different from picture.,59294,3
59294,All in all its still very cute and as longs as you buy a bigger size you'll be fine.,59294,3
59296,"Material is a bit flimsy, but as expected considering the cost.",59296,3
59297,I am returning these sandals.,59297,3
59297,I bought them since they were advertised as being good for people with plantar fasciitis.,59297,3
59297,I could tell they weren't going to help the minute I put them on.,59297,3
59297,They fit OK but the arch support is ligned too close to the heel and will make the plantar fasciitis worse instead of better.,59297,3
59297,Plus they are not particularly attractive.,59297,3
59297,You can't see them in the online photo but there are too many straps across the top of the foot.,59297,3
59297,The mateial actually looks like plastic even though it is listed as leather.,59297,3
59297,Overall I was not at all impressed with them.,59297,3
59298,"Love these glasses, these are my second pair.",59298,3
59298,"Although they failed to include the ""free microfiber pouch"" with BOTH shipments.",59298,3
59299,"Cute designed racerback work-out top, but... the material is heavy and not conducive to warmer weather climates.",59299,3
59299,Not enough stretch for the size indicated.,59299,3
59299,I would order one size larger IF you live north of San Francisco.,59299,3
59300,"Love the shirt, the only reason I gave 3 stars is that the photo makes it look like a regular shirt but it's very cropped.",59300,3
59300,"I can wear with with a high waisted skirt, etc., but I was hoping to wear just as a normal shirt for work reasons",59300,3
59301,bra is smaller than expected,59301,3
59302,Not a goog fit n made in China,59302,3
59305,Cute bows but they were too small for my 18 month old with an average size head,59305,3
59306,"Made me feel a bit frumpy, a little longer than it appears.",59306,3
59307,"It's Asian sized - runs very, very small.",59307,3
59308,little on the small side.,59308,3
59309,"I think it's somewhat overrated, it feels like just any other sports bra.",59309,3
59309,I wish the shoulder part was thinner as the straps show when wearing only with a tank-top.,59309,3
59309,Also the pads move around even when washed in a lingerie bag.,59309,3
59309,Also the colors are lame.,59309,3
59310,Beautiful pattern but fit way smaller than sized.,59310,3
59311,Looks cool but if u look too hard you start to think it was from a McDonalds happy meal.,59311,3
59312,"They r nice, they don't feel cheaply made; but one thing I have a problem with is that I've only had them for about two weeks and they r already looking tarnished",59312,3
59313,picture was a little blurry.,59313,3
59314,Ordered from Camellias MANY TIMES but this is the first one to disappoint.,59314,3
59314,Came nicely packaged but the front of the corset seemed...,59314,3
59314,Bent upward giving it a weird look when put on.,59314,3
59314,Even when tightly laced the front did not give...,59314,3
59314,Going to RMA this one and look at the other better options.,59314,3
59314,Giving three stars because of the long line of products we've bought and not disappointed with.,59314,3
59315,"Love the jacket, correct size (7/8) but the fit was too small.",59315,3
59317,"I liked it but it hurt my lip after a while and it left me a very light scar, it would also mark my skin and leave me a red mark after I took it off.",59317,3
59317,I would use it for 8  hours straight so maybe that was the problem but I liked how fast it was shipped and the packaging it came in.,59317,3
59317,It stayed on my lip though throughout the day which was good and it looked real which was pretty awesome but as I said before it left a mark after I would take it off.,59317,3
59318,not bad but isn't a good bag for everyday use.,59318,3
59318,one hugh compartment and it zips to close.,59318,3
59318,wish it had 2 compartments and pockets.,59318,3
59319,Larger than you expect,59319,3
59320,You have to shake the thing a lot to keep it on time...,59320,3
59321,Very nice color and design but it's just not the real african fabric,59321,3
59322,Nice hats but nowhere near as slouchy as advertised,59322,3
59323,the scoop neck went way lower on mine to show my belly button.,59323,3
59323,Also there is barely enough strap at the top to tie around the neck.,59323,3
59323,Looks nice in the picture but it's much cheaper looking in real life.,59323,3
59324,I had ordered a large.,59324,3
59324,The top was very small and didn't fit at all.,59324,3
59324,The skirt fit great and was very flattering to my figure.,59324,3
59325,I purchased a large but it was a bit big in the bust area.,59325,3
59325,I was about to return it but tried to adjust the strap.,59325,3
59325,"Once I adjusted the strap, it fit me okay.",59325,3
59325,Still a little bit big in that area but it can work.,59325,3
59325,Please note that this is a costume not a dress meaning that the quality is really thin but for the price and for the occasion it will work.,59325,3
59325,I am prepared to be a little chilly on that evening.,59325,3
59326,"I have just received this dress in the mail , over all it is my favorite dress but it came a little too small .",59326,3
59326,I had thought about returning it get a larger size but I have changed my mind and have decided to use it as a bikini cover up .,59326,3
59326,"I advise you to get a larger size , I am probably going to order another but in the size XL .",59326,3
59326,My package did come destroyed and the dress kind of broke off (the string to tie the dress) but nothing a needle and thread can fix .,59326,3
59327,"I have not inserted the studs into a piercing yet, but they arrived timely and look fashionable.",59327,3
59327,I will update the review when I wear the jewelry.,59327,3
59328,I really like this necklace.,59328,3
59328,It's cute and goes with anything.,59328,3
59328,I'm a fan of bolder jewelry and this is pretty dainty.,59328,3
59328,But it is very cute and looks great for those casual outings.,59328,3
59328,It does get knotted very easily.,59328,3
59328,But it is cute.,59328,3
59329,Decent for the price.,59329,3
59329,Not form fitted like the image shows.,59329,3
59330,"Did not get to use, because they were too small",59330,3
59332,MUCH SMALLER THAN EXPECTED,59332,3
59333,Should have got a smaller size.,59333,3
59333,Not sure if it really does what it says.,59333,3
59334,Ordered the black w. White flowers...l received the navy blue with beige flowers...disappointed!,59334,3
59335,"it's a cute top and very flowy but, its not the type of top you want to be running in... my strap tore two days after I got it... because I was running",59335,3
59336,"I loved it until the beaded neck broke into pieces at my baby shower, and I had to embarrassingly have the hostess snip it off me.",59336,3
59336,"I now have a tube top dress, which is still pretty but obviously less support.",59336,3
59336,I really liked it until the wardrobe malfunction.,59336,3
59337,I bought the Chanyeol jacket size large but it's a bit shorter than expected and I won't be able to close the zipper unfortunately.,59337,3
59337,I thought it was weird because I've bought a sweater from there before and it fit perfectly fine unlike this one.,59337,3
59337,"If you aren't sure, I'd recommend buying the jacket a size bigger than what you actually are?",59337,3
59337,"Other than that it looks as advertised, was neatly packed in the box and arrived fairly quick.",59337,3
59339,Fun toy for a child's christmas gift.,59339,3
59340,The XL fits like a medium.,59340,3
59341,"Fit of collar, not good",59341,3
59342,Recieved this dress on time.,59342,3
59342,The colors are nice its navy with a shine like purple.,59342,3
59342,Its lace on top with a satin like fabric underneath.,59342,3
59342,I ordered a 4XL since the sizes seem to be small.,59342,3
59342,Fits like a large.,59342,3
59342,So didn't really fit me loose but it isn't too tight either.,59342,3
59342,My normal dress size is a 16 and this felt like a 14.,59342,3
59342,Also the dress is thin so its see through.,59342,3
59343,"Product is pretty and indeed silver,  however fragile as well.",59343,3
59343,I am currently waiting for shipped replacement.,59343,3
59344,"The red color dye was not fast, it bled in the laundry.",59344,3
59345,"I ordered a size larger due to some reviews, it's bigger than I would like but, I love the color and will order in a smaller size next time.",59345,3
59346,They are very cute but they are not made true to the size :-(...I guess I have to find a skinny person to give my large outfit as a gift.,59346,3
59347,Not the highest quality.,59347,3
59347,Afraid of what it will look like after a few washes.,59347,3
59348,"Wish this was a bit brighter, since it's all yellow it is a bit faded.",59348,3
59351,Maybe a bit short,59351,3
59352,These were a little darker color than expected.,59352,3
59352,"Also, the top button came off in the first wash.",59352,3
59354,It's an inexpensive dress so there's not much to complain about.,59354,3
59354,It's cute but as other reviewers have said its a little tight  in the bust- if you're busty and the colors are different.,59354,3
59354,My main complaint is that it is printed instead of embroidered and the lining only comes halfway- was hoping this could work for church but maybe not.,59354,3
59354,"Overall though- it's a light, fun maxi dress that is totally ok.",59354,3
59354,It'll probably go to goodwill at the end of the season- but so will a lot of trends.,59354,3
59355,Kind of a poor quality of material...,59355,3
59355,The designs and print aren't nearly as cute as in person compared to the pictures.,59355,3
59356,Not as sturdy as I hoped,59356,3
59357,"I ordered this dress in green and black, both size 12, in order to decide which color I preferred to wear to an upcoming military ball.",59357,3
59357,"Unfortunately, I will be returning both of them.",59357,3
59357,"First, the positives:
This dress is very pretty.",59357,3
59357,The green was exactly as pictured and the lace is very nice.,59357,3
59357,The dress appears to be well made and the fabric has a nice weight to it.,59357,3
59357,"Unfortunately, even going by the size guide for the dress, I found the dress to be significantly smaller than advertised.",59357,3
59357,"In particular, it's about 3"" shorter than it says.",59357,3
59357,"I ordered a 12, which according the size guide should be 60"" long.",59357,3
59357,"I measure the dress on a hanger at 57"" from shoulder to hem.",59357,3
59357,"On me, it hangs about 55.5"" from the shoulder.",59357,3
59357,"I'm 5'7"" and measure 58"" from shoulder to floor so this doesn't work, even if I'm not wearing heels.",59357,3
59357,The bust is also about an inch smaller than advertised.,59357,3
59357,"I am very busty (34DD) and I measure about 39.5"" with a bra on, so I was expecting it to be a little bit tight, as the listed measurement is 38.5"".",59357,3
59357,I was not expecting to be squished completely flat.,59357,3
59357,"Measuring over the dress, I measured the bust at closer to 37.5"".",59357,3
59357,"The measurements for the waist and hip seem to be accurate, and there's enough stretch to accommodate my 43"" hips without it pulling too tight.",59357,3
59357,"If I had only ordered one of these dresses, I might chalk the differences up to poor quality control or a fluke.",59357,3
59357,But I ordered two in different colors and both fit exactly the same.,59357,3
59357,It's also worth noting that (at least on me) the V in the neck comes down pretty low.,59357,3
59357,"Not necessarily a bad thing, but I wasn't expecting it to be as low as it was based on the picture.",59357,3
59357,"Overall, it is a really nice dress, especially for the price, and has the potential to be very flattering on someone whose measurements match the dress.",59357,3
59357,"In the green, I am barefoot, in the black I am wearing about 3"" heels.",59357,3
59358,"Mine is more gold than rose gold, but still a pretty ring.",59358,3
59359,This runs extremely small.. maybe if you wore a small or medium it would fit.,59359,3
59359,It's pretty colors but if your a plus size it will not fit..,59359,3
59360,Material is cheap and thin,59360,3
59361,sorry but I don't wear shoe brush,59361,3
59363,"Feel kind of cheap, but for 13 bucks it's okay",59363,3
59364,A little overpriced compared to others.,59364,3
59365,The material is very light weight but surprisingly does not ball up like I thought it would.,59365,3
59365,Sleeves have a zig zag stitch on the end.,59365,3
59367,Super cute and great quality... just a little too small for my fingers.,59367,3
59368,I ordered this for my 6 mo old grand daughter and when i received it I could not wait to try it on her.,59368,3
59368,It is a little small.,59368,3
59368,It fits but it is snug and she won't be able to wear it very long at all.,59368,3
59368,I was hoping to use it all summer but that is not going to happen.,59368,3
59368,I do love it and it is adorable but i wish i would have ordered a bigger size.,59368,3
59369,This was a little different than expected.,59369,3
59369,What I did't understand from the pictures is that the top is basically just a piece of cloth that has to be wrapped around your chest.,59369,3
59369,The results were not flattering.,59369,3
59370,cute but runs small even though its elastic.,59370,3
59371,"I'm 5'4"" and 120lbs, even right after my c-section when I weighed about 10 more lbs these were still too loose on me.",59371,3
59372,"I feel like he size fits perfect and the fabric is nice, but when I received the costume there was a big hole where it wasn't sewn together on the hood.",59372,3
59372,That was pretty disappointing because i now have to find someone to sew it.,59372,3
59373,"The picture does the blouse more justice, the blouse was nice but quality wasn't great.",59373,3
59373,"I bought it for my daughter, it looks nice and the size is a true fit.",59373,3
59374,"They are pretty, but heavy and bend my ear lobes.",59374,3
59375,Made for thinner ppl.,59375,3
59375,Gave it to my daughter who wears a size 3 in juniors.,59375,3
59376,Too big for an extra small.,59376,3
59376,I have to roll the waist... the top is large too.,59376,3
59377,Quality is not good,59377,3
59378,"I like the look of the shirt, but it tends to cling around my stomach area uncomfortably.",59378,3
59378,"Other than that, it's a good shirt, but I don't think I'd buy it again.",59378,3
59380,You get what it costs.,59380,3
59380,Cheap material very bright colors.,59380,3
59380,Not very scoop neck.,59380,3
59381,These pajama jeans are super comfortable.,59381,3
59381,"If that was all I was hoping for, I would keep them.",59381,3
59381,"However, they are expensive for what I consider a pair of lounge pants that look like jeans.",59381,3
59381,"As for the style, while they could certainly pass for jeans if you decide to wear them out of the house, they aren't what I consider stylish, and the fabric is not attractive.",59381,3
59381,"They kind of reminded me of jeans you could buy from Sears, or Kmart.",59381,3
59381,"At that price, I had hoped they'd be really cute, AND comfortable.",59381,3
59381,"So, back to the seller they go.",59381,3
59381,I would be willing to pay maybe $25 for this item.,59381,3
59382,Great colors and picture is pretty true to life.,59382,3
59382,"They don't seem to breathe very well and they are pretty tight, but they are a novelty item so I didn't expect much.",59382,3
59383,Way too small for an American size.,59383,3
59383,"Product information should note this is in Asian sizes and to fit an American size of 14-16, there should be a size XXX-L",59383,3
59384,cute and pkg nicely but one of button holes was not cut out and had little green stains by 3 buttons was this used?,59384,3
59385,"It fits nice, but there is a stain on it.",59385,3
59385,I am grateful I am good at working on stains.,59385,3
59386,"Extremely flimsy, if you're serious about waist training pass this one up and splurge a little more.",59386,3
59386,If you're just looking for a waist cincher to put under your clothes then this is a cheap one that could work a few times.,59386,3
59386,Hooks are very flimsy and I bent one putting it on the very first time so put it on carefully.,59386,3
59387,I did not receive the micro fiber bags for the sunglasses.,59387,3
59387,I bought 3 pair and no micro fiber bags with any of them!,59387,3
59388,I love that my cards don't fall out the slots..but one thing though..the plastic that holds the phone need to be harder..its cracked already after my dropped a few times..yeah so other than that its ok,59388,3
59389,Too short in the inseam so I gave it away.,59389,3
59389,Looks super cute on a shorter person,59389,3
59390,The collar is scratchy and irritates the skin because of how it is sewn together.,59390,3
59390,"Also, the length is too short.",59390,3
59390,Not super impressed with this item.,59390,3
59391,The quality is great but the waist band is huge.,59391,3
59391,Unless you are the size of Jupiter the waist band won't fit.,59391,3
59392,It seems to be a good deal.,59392,3
59392,Just order extra big,59392,3
59393,Legs and arms fit funny.,59393,3
59393,He didn't get to wear them very long because of it,59393,3
59394,"The wallet is good quality and design, but it is too big in my opinion.",59394,3
59394,It barely fits in my back pocket and is a lump to sit on when full.,59394,3
59394,"I tend to carry a lot in my wallet which is why I liked the design and organization of this one, but it is too fat and wide if you are looking for a discreet carry.",59394,3
59395,"I'm a size 5, 5'4..120 lbs and bought large and the top and bottom were both so snug that it left marks on my body!",59395,3
59396,The sweatshirt runs a little small but overall it is an okay product.,59396,3
59397,I bought them for my 3  yrs old son and he absolutely loved it!,59397,3
59397,It comes with a cord with 2 usb ports to charge both shoes at the same time.,59397,3
59397,Negative is lights lasts just less than an hr..,59397,3
59397,Inside lace came out.. except these everything is very gud.. best thing we can change the colors with remote.,59397,3
59398,I ordered this in a small and knew it would probably be a little smaller than I'd want for a tunic dress and I was right.,59398,3
59398,Cute dress but not worth roughly $50 in my opinion.,59398,3
59398,"Great quality, that's just not something I'd usually spend for a casual dress.",59398,3
59399,Not what I expected it's very see through,59399,3
59400,"my niece tried it on and it fit her, she's nine.",59400,3
59400,it is very beautiful though,59400,3
59401,The outfit is super cute and comfy.,59401,3
59401,However it's really big.,59401,3
59401,I read the other reviews that said it fit large but ordered anyways so fool on me.,59401,3
59401,I'm just gonna let baby boy grow into it because other than the size issue I love it.,59401,3
59403,It is really pretty.,59403,3
59403,Definitely must wear a camisole under it.,59403,3
59403,It is also short.,59403,3
59403,It comes above my jeans.,59403,3
59404,Bought this in black and in pink.,59404,3
59404,The Pink is noticably looser than the black.,59404,3
59404,Not sure what happened as they are the same size.,59404,3
59405,The little metal colored piece in the upper left corner was missing ...,59405,3
59406,"Too small for ""large""",59406,3
59407,A little tight even though I bought a size up,59407,3
59408,According to the picture I assumed that the feet were covered.,59408,3
59408,But they were not.,59408,3
59408,The feet are out.,59408,3
59408,And honestly that was the main reason i chose this one comparee to the others.,59408,3
59408,It does what its suppose to.,59408,3
59409,Good quality but it was not so brown and way orange.,59409,3
59410,I have purchased this hat before but this time around the quality is substandard since the straw in the top of the hat easily breaks apart when handled.,59410,3
59410,I would not recommend this hat for life guard duty.,59410,3
59411,"I will give to my granddaughter on her October birthday, but it does appear to be a little on the small side.",59411,3
59411,"If it is, I will probably order her a larger one for Christmas.",59411,3
59412,Much heavier fabric than previous order.,59412,3
59412,They are much fuller in legs too.,59412,3
59414,Disappointed in the knit material and overall quality is not as I expected.,59414,3
59414,"The design, however, is just perfect and very flattering on.",59414,3
59415,"I had the necklace for about a month, and it broke after that.",59415,3
59415,"It was cute while it lasted, but it was not great quality.",59415,3
59416,Kinda small but nice colors,59416,3
59417,"Great gift, just watch the pricing.",59417,3
59417,"Bought one at $17, then can back and got 2 more and didn't notice the price had doubled.",59417,3
59417,Now they're up to $44 each.,59417,3
59417,"Silver isn't going up that much, so who knows why these are.",59417,3
59418,Product came much quicker than expected.,59418,3
59418,It was very cute and a great price.,59418,3
59421,Large was too short for 6'.,59421,3
59421,Not much to do but wear black underneath.,59421,3
59422,The fit is good and they are comfortable.,59422,3
59422,"I like the bottoms, but top is just OK.",59422,3
59423,"Was great for like half a month, then started to fall apart.",59423,3
59423,I'm down like two strings now.,59423,3
59423,I do enjoy the adustable tie tho.,59423,3
59423,Just don't pull on it and don't sleep with it,59423,3
59424,"This shirt is cute, but the pants are awful.",59424,3
59424,Came faster than expected.,59424,3
59425,"Okay, but would be better without the pink trim on the outside rim.",59425,3
59426,I wasn't looking for a loose fit top so this wasn't what I was expecting.,59426,3
59426,"It's a nice shirt, but too loose for me.",59426,3
59427,"Shirt, tie and cummerbund fit great and shipped super fast.",59427,3
59427,The only problem was the box with the studs and cuff links was empty.,59427,3
59428,But i typically wear a 4/6 and this dress was tight!,59428,3
59428,Rush ordered the size up for $17 shipping and it was way too large.,59428,3
59428,The sizing is clearly off.,59428,3
59428,But a very nice dress.,59428,3
59428,I squeezed into it anyways.,59428,3
59428,Also note that the back slit is pretty high up.,59428,3
59429,not and expected no inside pattern and almost a wicking material + way too big.,59429,3
59429,i ordered a XL bc of all the reviews saying it is too small and it is way to big.,59429,3
59429,"i am 5""1.5 and weigh 130. i still love it though.",59429,3
59430,Cheap in quality but fine for the price.,59430,3
59430,"I love the bottoms for coverage, but they do roll up when swimming.",59430,3
59430,The top is HUGE.,59430,3
59430,"I ordered a small and the bottoms fit like a medium, and the top like an XL.",59430,3
59430,I couldn't use the top at all.,59430,3
59430,The print is really cute.,59430,3
59431,Does not latch easy if you put a credit card in each slot...had to take one credit card out to latch.... Fine now,59431,3
59432,"It isn't as figure flattering as I expected, but it was better than a plain Tee when I wanted to just relax.",59432,3
59434,I ordered a size up and they were a size too small.,59434,3
59434,It's hard to get the lights to go-but super cute!,59434,3
59435,too small and not as much stretch as I was expecting.,59435,3
59436,US Sizes is a bit deceiving.,59436,3
59436,They still run small across the shoulders and chest but the sleeves are too large.,59436,3
59436,I purchased a Large.,59436,3
59436,That means the sleeves fit like an XL and the rest like a Medium.,59436,3
59436,Too bad; it's a good looking shirt.,59436,3
59436,The material is what I expected for the price.,59436,3
59437,"Pants run smaller in the waist, just go up a size.",59437,3
59437,"My only issue with these are after the dryer they need to be ironed every time, these wrinkle like crazy.",59437,3
59438,The earring hook broke the 3rd day.,59438,3
59439,"Kinda heavy in your hair, but pretty.",59439,3
59440,This dress is NOT the color in the photo - it is more of a cerulean blue and you can clearly see the pattern of the dress.,59440,3
59440,"If you want a dress that looks exactly like the one in the photo, try a cosplay website, where items are more expensive but are much more realistic and made better.",59440,3
59440,"It did fit as expected and came with a badge, but if I had the choice I would definitely return this and spend a few extra bucks on a more realistic item.",59440,3
59441,It fit good I work with it on,59441,3
59442,"The color is pretty good when in large quantities and the consistency is great, but this is very pink once it thins a bit and the level of stainage on your skin is ridiculous.",59442,3
59442,Its been several days of rigorous scrubbing and my nails are still stained pink.,59442,3
59443,"Cute, but it doesn't glow in the dark!",59443,3
59443,"I still like it, though.",59443,3
59444,It fits fine but the material doesn't look all that great.,59444,3
59444,It is a good buy for the price.,59444,3
59445,"It was a lovely dress, I got a TON of compliments on it!",59445,3
59445,"However it was pretty poorly made, my seams kept tearing and there was an awkward poof of fabric in the front of the gown, across the ruching that hadn't been sewn down.",59445,3
59445,"It was comfortable and pretty but I wish it was better made, I was afraid I was going to accidently tear off the sleeves or mess up the bodice seams.",59445,3
59445,"Unfortunately, I can only wear this gown once out of fear of tearing it after a second use.",59445,3
59446,But they're definitely not waterproof.,59446,3
59446,Maybe the pocket liners but that's it.,59446,3
59447,somehow I expected something more burgundy in color.,59447,3
59448,Okay so first of all it came in a week before expected.,59448,3
59448,The hat was crushed and now it's kinda mishapen because of how it was shipped.,59448,3
59448,The printing on the hat is not exactly like shown in the picture.,59448,3
59448,Its more blurry in a sense?,59448,3
59448,And the arms on top are shorter it completely cut off the words on the arm.,59448,3
59448,"Overall the hat is okay, I mean for less than 5$ it's pretty okay.",59448,3
59448,Still an overall cool design.,59448,3
59449,"I like them and even the material, unfortunately they are way small.",59449,3
59449,Everything I have bought has been to small,59449,3
59450,I followed the size guide provided in the site.,59450,3
59450,I went ahead and ordered a larger size as recommended but it fit too big.,59450,3
59451,"I say fits as expected after measuring myself and matching up the measurements, I typically wear a US size 10/12 in a dress, I had to order the 16w in this dress & it fits, quality isn't bad for the price, need to snip some threads and iron down some appliqus with tape, also needs to be steamed/pressed before use as it is very wrinkled.",59451,3
59452,Very cute crop top but the writing is beginning to come off,59452,3
59453,Very beautiful necklace butt unfortunately it fell apart at the clasp.,59453,3
59454,Good fake but still fake.,59454,3
59454,Too fake for the price.,59454,3
59454,"They have the engraved RB and the Ray-Ban in the corner but it says ""Ray-Ban P"" instead so that's stupid but whatever.",59454,3
59454,Not worth the money but fine glasses either way,59454,3
59455,Product looks as depicted and arrived on time and well packaged.,59455,3
59455,"I'm a size 4 and short, so the dress is a little long - the skeletons hips aren't in the right place.",59455,3
59455,The dress is a bit long.,59455,3
59455,"So if your 5'4"" or under, know what to expect.",59455,3
59455,Other than that - great value for the price.,59455,3
59456,:(  Had to return it.,59456,3
59457,"I guess it fit true  to size but I was going off the reviews and went a size smaller than what I usually buy, which is a Lg or XLg.",59457,3
59457,I bought a size M and it was to small at the breast area and the length was a little to short.,59457,3
59457,"I'm 5'4"" and 145lbs.",59457,3
59458,Otherwise a good product.,59458,3
59459,Not as sturdy as I would like.,59459,3
59460,I ordered a large and it fits like a small but Overall I love the style.,59460,3
59461,The backing was to loose and cannot be adjusted,59461,3
59462,But got the wrong size mailed to me.,59462,3
59462,Got all these colors but the black was wrong size.,59462,3
59462,But the pants are great =),59462,3
59463,can barely fit on foot,59463,3
59464,"This looks great on the model in the photo, but was a bit small.",59464,3
59464,"I would say Asian size, and not much to it material wise.",59464,3
59464,"This is certain for fashion, and no extended wear.",59464,3
59465,The material is good quality and soft.,59465,3
59465,The bust was a bit too small and the waist was a bit too big.,59465,3
59465,"I had to have it altered, looks much better now.",59465,3
59465,I love the full skirt.,59465,3
59465,"Doesn't need a petticoat, but looks much fuller with one.",59465,3
59465,The color is right on point with the picture!,59465,3
59466,These were way smaller than I thought.,59466,3
59466,They didn't fit my 2 year old or 3 year old,59466,3
59467,"I ordered an XL as I do in all shirts, and it was quite small.",59467,3
59467,I recommend ordering one size larger than usual.,59467,3
59467,"Other than that, it seems to be of good quality.",59467,3
59468,This is a really cute skirt and shirt set.,59468,3
59468,I loved it the 1st and 2nd time my daughter wore it.,59468,3
59468,"However, the skirt did not hold up to my washer.",59468,3
59468,It tore the filmy (chiffon) fabric over the skirt.,59468,3
59468,"I would encourage you to order this, but handwash the skirt.",59468,3
59468,My daughter loved wearing it too.,59468,3
59469,Took a LONG time to arrive and the stitching isn't great.,59469,3
59469,I've had to restitch a few places.,59469,3
59469,The zipper doesn't work.,59469,3
59469,But she loves Rilakkuma and thinks it's a warm PJ; apparently these positives outweigh the negatives for her and she would say 5 stars.,59469,3
59472,"Its OK but hard to read, and the time changes for no reason",59472,3
59473,"This blouse is very pretty, but very.",59473,3
59474,"The bow and flower fell off, but i fixed it.",59474,3
59474,Its still a pretty dress,59474,3
59475,I ordered this last summer as a dress to wear around the house on days that I wasn't going out.,59475,3
59475,"I felt the price was too high for the quality, but it would've been more trouble to ship it back so I kept it.",59475,3
59475,I did wear it a few times.,59475,3
59475,"It's very comfortable, it's just really big...",59475,3
59476,Measurements seemed to be on the small side.,59476,3
59477,Too small but love the  unique made of the blazer,59477,3
59478,Too baggy and has a lot of lint.,59478,3
59479,"The colors are bright and the designs are cute...but after one wash, one pair already has a hole along the seam.",59479,3
59479,"I bought a 4T for my 2.5 year old, and they're quite snug.",59479,3
59479,"Overall, I'm not terribly impressed by the quality but my son likes them.",59479,3
59480,"I am 5""11 and it's really long on me but is a really pretty dress on!",59480,3
59481,"They are super cute, and look like the picture, they don't come with a sleeve though.",59481,3
59481,"Mine came scratched, which is disappointing.",59481,3
59481,They do reflect a lot which is weird to look out of,59481,3
59482,I wear for once and already piling somehow.,59482,3
59483,The dress is too tight and it doesn't look like the picture posted,59483,3
59484,Smaller butterfly than I expected but holds good to the table,59484,3
59485,I ended up giving it away as a gift,59485,3
59486,Definitely doesn't fit to size.,59486,3
59486,Small runs like a large.,59486,3
59486,Will be returning since it's not worth it's money in tailoring fees,59486,3
59487,Cute idea but cheaply made.,59487,3
59487,Looks like someone in home ec classes made it in their first year sewing.,59487,3
59487,"The white accents do not lay well on the rest of the dress, and there are threads escaping inside the zipper (gets stuck on them) and around hems.",59487,3
59487,Not the type you would ever want to wash.,59487,3
59488,"The hat came smooshed, so I had to pop it back out in order for the product look more like it should be.",59488,3
59488,"It still has some dents, and did not sit on my head the way I wanted it to.",59488,3
59488,For the circumference if you are wondering is about 21 inches from what I measured.,59488,3
59488,"Overall, an okay hat but I would not buy again since I want a bigger hat for my head.",59488,3
59489,The glasses don't have as much blue as the picture.,59489,3
59489,I found the fit a bit weird.,59489,3
59489,I have a smaller face and head.,59489,3
59489,The glasses width seems a bit narrow on my face but the stems were really long.,59489,3
59489,After some bending and adjustments I got the stems just right.,59489,3
59489,"They look pretty cool on, but they are heavy.",59489,3
59489,So the slip down my nose easily and can only be worn for short time periods like driving and running errands.,59489,3
59489,"I wouldn't wear them exercising, playing golf, or at the beach.",59489,3
59491,Cheap with poor fit.,59491,3
59491,"I liked the length, but too low in rear and I don't have a large behind.",59491,3
59492,it is not beatiful but is an Okay ring,59492,3
59493,"Loved the design, Good quality.",59493,3
59493,I bought this hat for my 10 yr. old Grandson assuming the stretch band would allow for a flexible fit.,59493,3
59493,The hat was much too large for a 10 yr. old.,59493,3
59493,and a 14 yr old boy and an adult Women.,59493,3
59493,But a good fit for a XXL Adult Male.,59493,3
59494,It's cool but small what ever size you think you are buy a size bigger and instructions would be great or a heads up its in 2 peaces,59494,3
59495,Love the jacket for the price I paid.,59495,3
59495,I do wish the jacket was made with a thicker lining.,59495,3
59495,My daughter is in a 2T the jacket does seem slightly snug.,59495,3
59496,"love it - was a bit smaller then I hoped though, even though I ordered larger",59496,3
59497,"Fit is slightly off, like the sizing is different for the top and the bottom.",59497,3
59497,Cute dress and awesome material though!,59497,3
59498,"listed as sweat pants but more like PJ bottoms
not happy about that",59498,3
59499,"A little too floppy especially when it gets wet, but the tie is great.",59499,3
59499,I think I'd prefer more structured but shorter brim.,59499,3
59499,"Also to big for my 2 year old, tho she does have a tiny head.",59499,3
59500,"Looks good, but doesn't fit.",59500,3
59501,Good for the price but already a little worn since washing a few times,59501,3
59502,It looks (color and pattern) just like the photo.,59502,3
59502,It only covers about half of my butt.,59502,3
59502,"The velcro could be stronger, however, which is why I am only giving it 3 stars.",59502,3
59502,"I doubt I will use this as often as I planned, but it will go with many other pieces!",59502,3
59503,"I am positive I order this shirt in white but when I got it, it was grey",59503,3
59504,"pour quality, see through",59504,3
59505,"I actually love the way it fits, but the sleeves are more forearm length than long sleeved.",59505,3
59506,super soft but ran too small,59506,3
59507,The waste band of these is short and elastic is tight and a bit odd,59507,3
59508,"Fast shipping, rose gold color was true.",59508,3
59508,Only complaint is the ends are not rounded and were a bit sharp.,59508,3
59508,I took a buffer and filed it myself.,59508,3
59509,"Kinda cheap looking, but I wasn't expecting much at that price.",59509,3
59510,Gets pretty tangles but that's too be expected.,59510,3
59510,I think it may be a little off center.,59510,3
59510,But overall I'd say I'm happy with it for the price.,59510,3
59511,Snags on itself a little as you move your arms.,59511,3
59511,Sewing around the bottom hem is puckery and cheap-ishly done but it's not that noticeable given all the shine from the sequins.,59511,3
59511,It's has a few hook and loop fasteners (concealed) down the front to close it.,59511,3
59511,It's doing the trick for the outfit I need but I needed to belt it (with a sparkly black sash) to make it truly work.,59511,3
59511,It's kind of boxy otherwise.,59511,3
59512,Tshirt is a little thinner than I hoped.,59512,3
59512,"It does run a little slim, too.",59512,3
59512,Otherwise the color is great!,59512,3
59513,"The suit is very cute, but I did not like how the body underneath the dress/skirt was made.",59513,3
59513,It has a bikini bottom that is attached to a mesh panel.,59513,3
59513,I just thought it would only be a matter of time before that mesh panel ripped.,59513,3
59514,The quality of this garment us marginal.,59514,3
59514,It is a good thing I read the reviews so that I got a larger size.,59514,3
59514,I need that color for a suit or I would return it.,59514,3
59515,They are what I'm use too but they we not in the original box.,59515,3
59515,They  in a plastic bag.,59515,3
59516,Smelled bad for a few days.,59516,3
59516,It's a good size bag.,59516,3
59517,"It runs large, fabric is ok, is a see thru, more like to be comfortable at home in a hot summer!",59517,3
59519,"The fabric was not what was expected,  Too much like PJ fleece material.",59519,3
59519,The photo description leads to look like a rayon or silkier flowing look.,59519,3
59519,NO where near as elegant as it looks!,59519,3
59521,"This cardigan was not nearly as long as I thought it would be, but decent little cardigan for the price.",59521,3
59522,This item ships from China and arrived early which was a pleasant surprise!,59522,3
59522,The quality overall I'd rate 3/5.,59522,3
59522,The snaps do not seem like they will hold up for long as they're plastic and cheap.,59522,3
59522,For the price this product is OK but very large.,59522,3
59522,I did expect that from reviews on similar products but please keep that in mind!,59522,3
59522,This will probably not fit your bay smaller than 6 months.,59522,3
59522,The crown already has lint and fuzzier on the decal which I feel is the most disappointing part and has highly effected how I feel about the product.,59522,3
59522,I would probably not purchase again and would only recommend this if you are in love with the design!,59522,3
59522,I included photos so you can be the judge!,59522,3
59522,They do look cute in photos and the fuzzier don't show up on camera from what I can see!,59522,3
59525,Beautiful dress but too long for me!,59525,3
59526,This would be great if it weren't for the center strap.,59526,3
59526,It is too tight and doesn't sit well on my stomach.,59526,3
59526,I'm thinking about removing it...may even it will look better,59526,3
59528,Shirt came on time and seemed to be good quality.,59528,3
59528,"Was smaller than a medium, more like a small.",59528,3
59529,Rather large and not very well made.,59529,3
59529,The garters are quite small and I had difficulty fastening them to my stockings.,59529,3
59530,Awesome cleats sizes run small,59530,3
59532,Otherwise it is okay,59532,3
59534,These were cut very small.,59534,3
59534,Not at all true to size.,59534,3
59535,"Got this today, Looks cool, smells awful.",59535,3
59535,It's like a formaldehyde scent and I don't know how to get rid of it but for aesthetics same it's an okay buy,59535,3
59536,Was a little too big for my neck.,59536,3
59537,I reordered in XL rather medium due to tight fit.,59537,3
59537,"I am average size, 120 lbs and 5'6"" height.",59537,3
59537,The length is great and expect the larger size will become part of my winter longewear.,59537,3
59537,I will use the smaller ones strictly for exercise.,59537,3
59538,"As for a non iron shirt, it still needs to be ironed.",59538,3
59538,but great color and fit.,59538,3
59539,Sizing is just too small.,59539,3
59540,The actual shirt is very cute and comfortable although it is a bit low cut for me.,59540,3
59540,The problem I have is with the god awful tacky gold buttons.,59540,3
59540,They are plastic buttons coated in some sort of gold overlay that just looks so cheap I wouldn't even wear it out of the house.,59540,3
59540,I've thought of removing the buttons and replacing them but I'm not sure it would be worth it.,59540,3
59540,I'll just use the shirt as a pj top and then nobody will see them.,59540,3
59541,Pretty but very small.,59541,3
59541,I haven't tried it on yet but from looks it seems like it would be too small for the ear.,59541,3
59541,Update: Got it in my ear but the ball was tiny and impossible to put back in.,59541,3
59542,"Cute suit, a bit on the small side.",59542,3
59542,I am a 36C and the large was a bit tight up top.,59542,3
59542,The fringe is not as long as pictured and curls at the ends after it gets wet.,59542,3
59542,"Good quality, good for the price.",59542,3
59543,I didn't read the fabric content and was a little disappointed in how much lycra there is in them,59543,3
59544,"Good value, great colors but unfortunately no good for me as they are way too small.",59544,3
59544,I am a shoe size 9 and after ten minutes of wear lost the circulation in all my toes.,59544,3
59545,Wish this fabric was a bit softer.,59545,3
59545,Honestly these are shiny and very slick.,59545,3
59545,For the print I wish they were more if a soft or flannel like fabric.,59545,3
59546,The dress is cute and fits generously...  but the gloves would be hard pressed to fit a child.,59546,3
59546,The ears are cute and fit well.,59546,3
59546,What the picture does not show is the dress is a 'halter' style.,59546,3
59546,I am large busted and needed to wear a sweater to cover up straps.,59546,3
59547,"A little disappointed because these are larger than I expected, but they will do",59547,3
59549,"They are decent, not great, not bad.",59549,3
59549,Could be stitched better.,59549,3
59549,Not triangle/croch pattern stitch.,59549,3
59549,Mine came opposite then pictured(reverse colors).,59549,3
59549,Also sit higher on the waist then pictured.,59549,3
59549,Comfortable and fairly breathable.,59549,3
59550,This top came a bit larger than I expected.,59550,3
59550,It's  nice but the size puts me off.,59550,3
59551,the only fault i found with this product for my daughter was that it fits really big.,59551,3
59552,"The ad said these glasses were light brown but they are not, they are darker than the photo, much darker.",59552,3
59552,That's the only complaint I have.,59552,3
59552,They are good glasses and fit perfect.,59552,3
59552,I just wish they were what I thought they were as advertised - light brown.,59552,3
59553,I dropped it once and it did crack pretty easy but it still functions and looks good.,59553,3
59554,I really wanted to love this.,59554,3
59554,First time I wore it one of the stones fell out.,59554,3
59554,Not worth trying to return it.,59554,3
59555,I got two differtcolors of the same beanie.,59555,3
59555,"The burgundy one is smaller around and shorter, almost looks like it shrank in the wash.",59555,3
59555,The teal one is normal size in comparison.,59555,3
59555,Because of how different they fit they look like different beanies.,59555,3
59556,This shirt is super soft and appears to be made of good quality material.,59556,3
59556,"I typically wear a size small/medium shirt, but ordered a large after reading other reviews.",59556,3
59556,This shirt definitely runs small so it is recommended to order a size larger than you normally would.,59556,3
59556,"With that being said, the shirt fit very nicely.",59556,3
59556,"I would have liked it to be a little longer, however it looks nice as is.",59556,3
59556,I was disappointed with the bow located on the back of the shirt.,59556,3
59556,It is only attached in the middle so it flaps around and doesn't look as cute/hard to tell what it is.,59556,3
59556,I added a few stitches into both sides of the bow so that it would lie flat at all times to remedy this issue.,59556,3
59556,Overall this is a great tank; perfect for the summer!,59556,3
59557,The color of the bag looks prettier in the picture + the bag took time to be delivered,59557,3
59558,"The legs are skinnier than I expected, very tight in thighs",59558,3
59559,Arms are tight and doesn't stretch.,59559,3
59560,I would give it 5 stars if it properly.,59560,3
59560,I orginally ordered a L as the sizing chart shows would fit 36C.,59560,3
59560,I returned it and went for the XXL.,59560,3
59560,It fits better however I don't see how it would work for DD as it shows.,59560,3
59560,It barely fits in the chest.,59560,3
59560,Other than that its super cute!,59560,3
59561,The brush quality and quality of the Polish is low.,59561,3
59561,I would recommend spending a little more for quality polish and brushes.,59561,3
59562,"It fits great except the hood is very snug, can't have a updo or big hair.",59562,3
59563,"This is a very nice dress for someone with twig-like arms, and odd-shaped boobs.",59563,3
59563,"It is made very well and fit me, except the upper arm area was very tight to the point that it was like a tourniquet.",59563,3
59563,The padded top was very odd to say the least.,59563,3
59563,"I am 5'9"", 132lbs, and the rest of the dress fit fine.",59563,3
59563,I have to send it back though because of the two other odd features.,59563,3
59564,Well made just on the big side.,59564,3
59565,This purchase was a replacement for my wife.,59565,3
59565,She's able to fit everything into it that she wants to carry in this type of container.,59565,3
59565,Down side:  the awful smell from the inside of the wallet!,59565,3
59566,It was cute but its that's spandex material.,59566,3
59566,Get a slightly larger size especially if you're slim-thick-full figure bc it fit me a little snug,59566,3
59567,"I'm 5'7 165 and they way to small ,",59567,3
59568,"Shorts were too tight,  the pink top didn't hang in the 80s one shoulder fashion but more like a regular t-shirt.",59568,3
59568,I ordered a size up based on the reviews and it was still tight.,59568,3
59568,The leotard wouldn't stay clasped.,59568,3
59568,I ended up wearing my own shirt over it for style.,59568,3
59568,"Leggings not included,  leg warmers not included.",59568,3
59568,Bonus star for the head band thing.,59568,3
59568,I really liked it and will probably wear it just because.,59568,3
59569,"I thought I finally found the pefect leggings, until after only 3 washes and the zipper popped on the right hand side, now exposing my upper thighs.",59569,3
59569,"Because I liked the fit so much, I will order again.",59569,3
59570,These fit like skinny jeans.,59570,3
59570,The legs are pretty tight (and I have skinny legs...).,59570,3
59570,I would prefer a little more room in the legs.,59570,3
59570,I ordered the biggest size available.,59570,3
59570,I think these are made for smaller men.,59570,3
59570,They would probably look good on a smaller person but not so much on me.,59570,3
59570,Order much bigger than your normal size...,59570,3
59571,"It was beautiful, simple, perfect.. till it broke after only the second time wearing it.",59571,3
59572,"Used it for maybe 4 days and the strap is starting to fray at the edges :( It's a shame too, it's a cute bag.",59572,3
59573,Size was right but it was supposed to be a 3 pack and only received one pair so I am returning.,59573,3
59574,Nice ring but it has layers in order to have the wire in there and it's already seperating.,59574,3
59575,"Great shirt, but a bit small for the size.",59575,3
59577,"Nice gloves, however, they were too large for a women's small hands.",59577,3
59578,It fit well at first (I got a large) - but within a week I went from being on third clasp to first clasp and wanted to pull it tighter and you can't.,59578,3
59578,Next time I'm getting a corset type where you can pull strings a tie it.,59578,3
59579,Waist and pouch too small.,59579,3
59579,A large is like a small.,59579,3
59579,Keep jewels cool though.,59579,3
59579,But would not buy again.,59579,3
59580,The fabric is a bit lighter than pictured-- more like gunmetal grey.,59580,3
59580,"Also the fabric is a bit different than pictured, so it's very apparent that the pattern is geometric hearts rather than random stars and constellations.",59580,3
59580,Pretty bummed out by those two things.,59580,3
59580,Fit is wonderful and the skirt is nice and full.,59580,3
59580,"Would buy the same dress in a different fabric, but hopefully it's more accurate to the photo.",59580,3
59581,"The robe runs small, otherwise it's OK",59581,3
59582,i don't like the fact that the back is not all lace but its ok for the price,59582,3
59583,Cute but for teens,59583,3
59584,Not worth what I paid for it.,59584,3
59584,$12 is a bit steep for a pair of socks but my daughter loves zebras so I got suckered.,59584,3
59584,The socks are nothing special and not as long as I'd like them.,59584,3
59585,I wear a medium.,59585,3
59585,Bought an extra large which was still WAY too small!,59585,3
59586,Just what I was looking for.,59586,3
59587,"Good quality for the price, but it seems to run a little big.",59587,3
59588,"This bag overall seems well made, but as noted by other reviewers the shinyness of the bag was just to much for my tastes.",59588,3
59588,Just doesn't look like leather and would be hard to fool anyone.,59588,3
59588,Was worried when ordering that the dimensions showed this as 28 inches long and I feared it would be to big for carry on.,59588,3
59588,The bag is no longer than 22 inches.,59588,3
59588,I compared it in one of the pictures to the black leather bag that is often purchased with this one.,59588,3
59588,The black one is actually slightly bigger.,59588,3
59588,Not terrible for the price.,59588,3
59588,If you like the super shiny look go for it.,59588,3
59588,If you want something more casual that more resembles real leather then I'd look somewhere else.,59588,3
59589,I love the bag and look but it came with a rank smell so i send it back,59589,3
59590,The shirt itself is thick material.,59590,3
59590,The pocket and bow is a sheer see though material.,59590,3
59590,The lining around the shirt is an off white color not white like the stripes on the shirt.,59590,3
59590,The bow and the pocket look very cheaply sewn on.,59590,3
59590,The pocket and bow is not navy.,59590,3
59592,"The plugs fit fine, but they're about as twice as long as the picture suggests.",59592,3
59593,This is pretty much a get what you pay for situation.,59593,3
59593,My size is 34-36C and I was afraid it would be too small but it actually fits quite well.,59593,3
59593,The straps are a bit loose so probably not great for a band size smaller than a 34.,59593,3
59593,It looks a lot cheaper in person than the pictures online but I still like the strappy back.,59593,3
59593,The front just looks like a simple bandeau but with some padding.,59593,3
59593,I will update with pictures later but honestly I am happy it fits and will be useful in the summer under tank tops.,59593,3
59594,Its a little tight but love it.,59594,3
59594,The fabric is so soft and thin.,59594,3
59596,they are mainly just for fun they are not a pair of shoes to be worn all day,59596,3
59597,Cute but fits very small,59597,3
59598,Wanted to love it but alas.,59598,3
59598,I love waffles more...,59598,3
59599,"Looks better in pic , don't like it, cheap material",59599,3
59600,I really wanted to love this jacket.,59600,3
59600,"It was exactly what I have been looking for, unfortunately the lining of one sleeve is too big and sewn in twisted making it a pain to put your arm inside.",59600,3
59600,Once on it is ok but I was expecting better quality.,59600,3
59601,When you wash them the swank a little,59601,3
59602,"It's cool, but was a little cheap looking.",59602,3
59602,Not real jewelry; it was plastic.,59602,3
59602,I thought it was metal.,59602,3
59602,But it's still a good size.,59602,3
59603,The crown is too low so it doesn't fit as well as I would like.,59603,3
59604,Was not what I expected.,59604,3
59605,"It's ok, doesn't look quite as nice in person as on line",59605,3
59606,I'm fairly tall and some would say I have an athletic build.,59606,3
59606,These barely come over my knees.,59606,3
59606,I wish they were taller for ... taller women.,59606,3
59608,"I really liked the color, however the top is significantly small for the size stated.",59608,3
59610,Very cute dress but the top is really big and you will definitely need a tank or bandeau top.....I ordered bigger due to the reviews but could have gone with a smaller size,59610,3
59611,Great T-shirt but two things were not as I had hoped.,59611,3
59611,The first being the size it runs much longer and bigger than normal and the color on the graphic has more of a faded look and not as bright as pictured,59611,3
59612,"This is a super cute dress, although the material is a little thin, but that really isn't a problem.",59612,3
59612,I would advise anyone ordering to go up a size because it runs a little small.,59612,3
59613,Pretty basic black tee.. Not that flattering but I can throw over peggyor skinny jeans so Ill keep.,59613,3
59613,I ordered an extra large because I experience ordering online its best to go up a size since sizes are never really true to the chart..but Im sure if I got a large in this shirt it will still be a bit shapeless.,59613,3
59614,Good quality just 3 sizes to small.,59614,3
59615,I wish the edges had a binding.,59615,3
59616,meaures smaller than normal,59616,3
59617,The sleeves are made of a mesh material with glitter so I don't think it is as comfortable as some of her other pj's.,59617,3
59619,"Great qulity, but aqua-blue coloring is not as vibrant as shown.",59619,3
59620,Shirt was too small.,59620,3
59620,Wasnt a fan of the material either.,59620,3
59621,transparent fabric run somewhat small,59621,3
59622,"The reason why I give 3 stars is cause it came on time, the designe is very nice, fits good but the quality is horrible, the fabric looks like the fabric for an apron :( very disappointed cause I really liked how it fits but not able to wear it",59622,3
59623,"Sizes run a bit bigger than measured, so keep that in mind.",59623,3
59623,"They were very helpful, though and offered to repay me for any alterations I needed.",59623,3
59623,Comfortable flowy material for all shapes and sizes.,59623,3
59624,Got this to replace one that was too small.,59624,3
59624,"It fits, but just.",59624,3
59624,"Otherwise fine, though the creases from packing and shipping still affect the shape negatively.",59624,3
59625,Can you replace that pair?,59625,3
59626,Did not help heel pain.,59626,3
59627,"The shirt was cute, but go one size up unless you like it snug.",59627,3
59628,Not as stretchy as I was hoping for,59628,3
59629,The medium was tight in the size and got the large one and it was to big up top.,59629,3
59629,I am in between sizes since I loss weight.,59629,3
59630,hoping for better coverage,59630,3
59631,Cute dress but I'm a little disappointed in the fabric.,59631,3
59631,My husband has several Cutter and Buck shirts so I was expecting a higher quality of cotton knit.,59631,3
59631,"This dress, though well made, is a very light weight almost flimsy fabric.",59631,3
59631,Not quite see-thru but close.,59631,3
59632,"I had to thread the laces through myself, which was extremely time consuming.",59632,3
59632,"They also don't stay up that well, so don't take them dancing.",59632,3
59632,And don't expect a ton of stretch!,59632,3
59632,"There's some stretch, but not like regular leggings.",59632,3
59632,Not really worth the money.,59632,3
59633,Definitely doesn't fit like pictured.,59633,3
59633,"Its much larger and roomy, If I didn't remove tags I would have returned.",59633,3
59633,Otherwise if that's what your looking for the shirt is nice material and nice style.,59633,3
59634,Poor quality and runs big.,59634,3
59635,"They were baggy on me and material a little ""sticky"" so I returned.",59635,3
59635,"Seemed well-made and a great color, however.",59635,3
59636,I bought this as a white elephant gift for a Christmas party.,59636,3
59636,For that it is great!,59636,3
59636,It was a lot of fun and got traded around a lot.,59636,3
59636,I don't think this is a daily use type item though but it looked handmade and even though the beard was removable I don't think I'd just wear the hat by itself for anything.,59636,3
59636,It fit okay but it isn't very trendy on it's own.,59636,3
59637,Its pretty but  the fabric is a little cheesy...,59637,3
59637,"Regardless, I get compliments when I wear it...",59637,3
59638,It is very small fit,59638,3
59639,BUY SMALLER RUNS BIG,59639,3
59640,There are a few repetitive design and what not but they are nice.,59640,3
59640,A couple of them weren't able to have the balls on them cause they were stripped overall there nice I got about 7 marijuana ones :),59640,3
59641,was wanting something larger but its very nice and unique for my documents at school,59641,3
59642,Pretty design but the color is misrepresented.,59642,3
59642,It is bone white.,59642,3
59643,It's a little hard to tell that the big magenta decoration on the front is a spider.,59643,3
59643,I got this to go with a spiderwoman costume for a Halloween party.,59643,3
59643,"It's cute and glittery, and goes with the overall spider theme.",59643,3
59643,The hat is not really a hat - the brim is flat and covers the entire bottom of the hat with no cutout for your head.,59643,3
59643,This means the hat sits on top of your head like a book or other flat object.,59643,3
59643,"Because it's smaller than a regular hat, I wouldn't expect much of my head to fit inside of it, but it does look a little funny just perched up there.",59643,3
59643,Plus it's not terribly stable without any recessed area to work with the curve of your head.,59643,3
59643,It has both a solid headband and an elastic band to secure the hat.,59643,3
59643,"The elastic was pretty much worthless in terms of helping the hat to stay on my head, so I removed it.",59643,3
59643,"The headband is pretty sturdy, although the hat is tall enough to wobble around a bit.",59643,3
59643,"If you're crafty and can attach combs to the ends of the headband, that would probably help to hold it in place.",59643,3
59643,"It's still a cute accent for my costume, and I like it fine.",59643,3
59643,"I didn't pay very much for it, so I didn't expect it to be a high-end fashion accessory.",59643,3
59644,Too thight yo short,59644,3
59645,I'm sure if the fit my partner better I'd be more inclined to give a better review.,59645,3
59645,Overall I give the product a satisfactory review.,59645,3
59645,"We don't hate the product, although we don't necessarily love it either.",59645,3
59646,But it's rather larger and thick.,59646,3
59646,Even straight form the package before anything was put in it.,59646,3
59646,It was returned do to its size.,59646,3
59646,It was well made.,59646,3
59646,3 stars only as a neutral vote.,59646,3
59647,I don't think it's the 'best winter hat.',59647,3
59647,The lining of the heat peeks through the top which annoys me and the ear flaps don't sit tightly against my face.,59647,3
59647,"I live in Chicago so I need a sturdy, warm hat and this one is just ok.",59647,3
59651,I like the color and the material seems to be of a good quality and it basically fit as expected.,59651,3
59651,"I also liked that it hangs low enough to cover my belly, but not so low that it looks like a dress.",59651,3
59651,The reason for the 3 stars is the straps.,59651,3
59651,They are placed very wide and I do foresee them persistently slipping of my shoulders.,59651,3
59651,But other than that it looks really nice and I like it.,59651,3
59652,Cute but noticeably shrinks after washing,59652,3
59653,The size seems to run small.,59653,3
59653,I would suggest ordering a size (or two sizes) up.,59653,3
59653,I don't like the underwire and took them out.,59653,3
59653,"Also, the cutting in the front is too low for me.",59653,3
59654,The scarf is very pretty and of nice enough quality; the color is more towards the pink range of purple.,59654,3
59655,"Just an OK buy for me, the first one came apart where the leather meets the elastic.",59655,3
59655,"These are sized small also, so order one size up from your normal size.",59655,3
59655,The company did send me another belt when I reported the belt broke on me so I gave them 3 stars.,59655,3
59656,Fits a little loose.,59656,3
59656,I haven't wore it because of that reason,59656,3
59657,The top came in a different design then shown as well as too small,59657,3
59659,"They're cute shoes but sadly this is the 2nd pair of NB walking shoes I've recently ordered that have no arch support, and are a bit short in the length.",59659,3
59659,I've ordered NB almost exclusively for many years and I'm very disappointed that I have to find another brand.,59659,3
59660,Stone came out the first week.,59660,3
59661,Fabric is heavy and thick.,59661,3
59662,The quality of this is not very high.,59662,3
59662,Has a very artificial feel to the fabric.,59662,3
59662,Also runs big around the bust but very small on the arm cuffs.,59662,3
59662,I cut them off.,59662,3
59662,Wore this three times and I think that is it.,59662,3
59663,They are somewhat tight,59663,3
59664,My sister out it on and five minutes later it fell off because it broke.,59664,3
59664,Because her costume won't show the back of her neck we are gonna use some small string to tie it together!,59664,3
59665,"These are for small, fit people!",59665,3
59665,I ordered the largest size available and they are too small.,59665,3
59665,They will work for around the house but since they are so slippery they won't stay up for a workout.,59665,3
59665,Very cute designs though.,59665,3
59666,"This scarf is pretty, but beware.",59666,3
59666,"The red is a rhodamine red, not a true red--more like a wine or pinky red.",59666,3
59666,"There is very little, if any green in the scarf, and what little green is in the scarf is an army/olive green.",59666,3
59666,"Otherwise the scarf is well-made, and will still look great with some outfits.",59666,3
59667,It was a little big.,59667,3
59671,Quality on finishing touches very poor,59671,3
59673,"I am usually a small , but I read other people's reviews and said go up a size ...",59673,3
59673,So I got a medium ...,59673,3
59673,"It did not come up over my shoulders , it was too small to fit my torso.... everywhere else fit ok, I'm 5'6 ..",59673,3
59673,I know a large would be too big...,59673,3
59674,These are for my 6 year old son.,59674,3
59674,"He loves them, but I think they are thin, cheap feeling and no sole so he literally just flys/slides  whenever he walks.",59674,3
59674,"I won't let him wear them to school, but he is taking them camping tomorrow and I won't cry if anything bad happens to them.",59674,3
59674,"I won't return them since they serve a purpose, but we won't buy them again.",59674,3
59675,I bought this after having a baby and it is both unflattering and not the most comfortable.,59675,3
59676,"The shirt looks good, but it's not true to size.",59676,3
59676,My son wears men's medium shirts of all kinds except this one.,59676,3
59676,Please order one size up if you intend to purchase from this seller or you will be disappointed and have to go to the trouble of returning the shirt.,59676,3
59678,Not quite as pictured and not as nearly as nice as a product as pictured,59678,3
59679,First and most importantly the color was totally wrong.,59679,3
59679,"I double checked that I actually had ordered the mustard color I wanted and sure enough, I had.",59679,3
59679,What I got was more pumpkin colored.,59679,3
59679,I looked at the color selections and didn't even see the color I had received as an option.,59679,3
59679,It took awhile to get here as well.,59679,3
59679,"I ordered it on the 2nd and it came on the 21st, but that is not a big deal.",59679,3
59679,Other than that you get what you pay for.,59679,3
59679,"The quality is fine, nothing spectacular.",59679,3
59679,"Somewhat scratchy, perhaps a washing will help.",59679,3
59679,"I do like it, the color is fine I will keep it, however I am afraid to order the mustard one again since I have no idea if I will actually get that color.",59679,3
59679,"The fit is not bad, exactly what I expected.",59679,3
59680,"This was ok for the price, but I had to return it due to the size.",59680,3
59680,"I ordered a small, which felt more like a medium.",59680,3
59680,"If you are looking for a gown, you'll probably be better off spending more for better quality.",59680,3
59681,Dress was beautiful but runs too small.,59681,3
59683,They could is sore tread on the bottom.,59683,3
59684,Not to size ordered.,59684,3
59684,I have other carharts that size and they fit fine these are tight in the waste.,59684,3
59685,The shirt is a xmas gift for a friend of mine so i cant really answer if it fits nicely.,59685,3
59685,He hasn't tried it on given that i had just opened it.,59685,3
59685,Comes as soon in photo and came on time.,59685,3
59685,I know hes going to love it.,59685,3
59685,"(though he did tell me yesterday he doesnt like paisley since we were looking at ties, but its john lennon.",59685,3
59687,"Ordered a 4T thinking my grand daughter of 2 would grow into them, but, barely fits her",59687,3
59688,I only got 6 pair.,59688,3
59688,One was way to small and tore as I put it on.,59688,3
59688,I do like the ones that fit!,59688,3
59689,"It seems nice, I ordered mine based on the size chart... but it is too small",59689,3
59690,I really like this but the first time it was used the strap broke.,59690,3
59691,3 stars and here is why.,59691,3
59691,Number one priority is the ability to block which is assumed at this point.,59691,3
59691,"Beyond that, I haven't ran into any of the poor quality features as mentioned in some of the other reviews as nothing on mine has failed to function or break.",59691,3
59691,"I don't find it sharp on the edges, also stated in other reviews.",59691,3
59691,I accept the limits of how much it can hold and the limited space.,59691,3
59691,I still hold my license and four other cards amongst some cash and papers.,59691,3
59691,"Not a lot, but a person really doesn't need that much on a daily basis, or in my case, for a trip overseas.",59691,3
59691,"Additionally, the more it holds, the bulkier they have to make it.",59691,3
59691,"Going in to the purchase I already accepted as fact that it would be an effective blocker and had a limited amount of holding space, but the selling point from me was it's sleek and cool design.",59691,3
59691,"It looks just as cool, but unfortunately I have had it only a few days and already have tons of scuff marks which I can only assume since they happened so soon, that they will only get uglier and more visible as time goes by.",59691,3
59691,"I am hoping that they do a little R&D for this product and give it an upgrade as I would easily spend a little more to get the same item, but with a case that doesn't scuff so easily.",59691,3
59692,Fits as expected using the products description section explaining the sizes.,59692,3
59692,I like the way it looks too and love the ankle cuffs.,59692,3
59692,My biggest problem with it is that the fabric is too thin.,59692,3
59692,Sweat will drip out of it like a shirt.,59692,3
59692,It stains my smartphone screen with sweat when I'm working out with it.,59692,3
59692,Also its not as evenly baggy as it looks in the photo picture.,59692,3
59693,They are okay.. but get stringy and aren't the best quality.,59693,3
59693,"Plus side is they are stretchy, long and comforable.",59693,3
59693,Down side is the stuff will fray.,59693,3
59694,"exactly what I was looking for, but the elastic waistband seems disproportionately smaller than for the size, making it hard to layer with anything tight fitting",59694,3
59695,Missing the A in Ronda....,59695,3
59696,"these belts are so so quality, low price so don't expect much.",59696,3
59696,"Also they are shorter then normal, order two sizes bigger then normal e.g if you use size 30 waist order a 34 because they will be about a 32 lenght",59696,3
59697,Okay for the money but don't not fit in the slightest,59697,3
59698,I bought a large because other reviews said it was big.,59698,3
59698,It was very large.,59698,3
59698,I wear a 16 and had to take it in about 2 inches on each side seam.,59698,3
59698,After I fixed it I absolutely love it.,59698,3
59699,Kind of cheap materials.,59699,3
59700,They are somewhat small and could use a larger pouch!,59700,3
59700,There is not enough room for american mens junk in these underpants.,59700,3
59701,"The purse is fine; however, the description is misleading.",59701,3
59701,"It says it is 7"" wide and it is at the bottom of the purse.",59701,3
59701,"The opening is not 7"".",59701,3
59701,I ordered it so that I could get my I Phone 6 Plus in it.,59701,3
59701,"It is difficult to get the phone in it, since the opening is not 7"".",59701,3
59702,Bigger than expected so I will most likely give it as a gift.,59702,3
59703,I wasn't sure how this would fit.,59703,3
59703,People in the reviews mention that they got it for their kids.,59703,3
59703,I bought 1 for my 3 year old but it it's way too big since it fits my head better.,59703,3
59703,It's even a bit big on my head.,59703,3
59703,This is the cheap knock off to the very popular Zara cat ear hat from a few seasons ago.,59703,3
59703,I didn't mind trying it out since it was only $6.,59703,3
59703,The item is thin feltish material and the shape is as pictured.,59703,3
59703,What is not pictured is that it arrived folded in half and flat.,59703,3
59703,I had to reshape it to wear it but it is very obviously still dented in areas where it was folded.,59703,3
59703,"I don't have anything to shape it on (leave it on top of head shaped item to bring the form back), might try to put it on another stiff hat and hope for the best.",59703,3
59703,It's not bad since it's $6 but you get what you pay for.,59703,3
59704,description said this was 95% cotton 5% spandex but It was 100% polyester  returned,59704,3
59705,Good material and design but is way to small,59705,3
59706,IewNot as big an opal I was expecting:(,59706,3
59707,I like this but it's scaled to a much smaller size.,59707,3
59708,They just didn't feel the way I had hoped.,59708,3
59709,This product was way too large for me.,59709,3
59709,I'm 5 ft and weight 145 pounds and very curvy,59709,3
59710,Its a good quality very warm hoodie and I loved the teal blue colour.,59710,3
59710,The fleecy lining is really nice and is on the arms too!,59710,3
59710,"It is slim fit, which I don't mind, but the arms were too short and the size of the hood was not quite big enough to use without it looking odd.",59710,3
59710,The hood design is a bit weird too: there are two holes at the top that the string is threaded through and I just thought it looked bad so I rethreaded it so the string wasn't visible up there.,59710,3
59710,In the end though I'm sending it back because of the size.,59710,3
59710,"Would be great if you're petite, less so if you are tall.",59710,3
59711,far to small even though I ordered largest size available,59711,3
59712,"I bought these pants because they looked attractive, and they are in fact quite pretty.",59712,3
59712,However they are closer to Capri length vs ankle length.,59712,3
59712,"Also, they don't allow for any room in the backside.",59712,3
59712,"I'm 5'6"", 113lb, and the mediums are too small for my rear end.",59712,3
59713,Read reviews and ordered a size 10--still too much room in this top.,59713,3
59713,Falls open and a lot of material in the bottom of shirt--too much to bunch up.,59713,3
59713,Cute top just didn't fit me right.,59713,3
59714,Well made but not for anyone with large nipples,59714,3
59715,"These were quite a bit smaller than I expected, I was still able to get into them, but there was not as much room as I would have liked.",59715,3
59715,"Also, these are extraordinarily sheer, if you're standing in front of a light source you can see right through them.",59715,3
59716,It's too big and the fact that they are maternity pants wasn't exactly broadcasted loudly on the page.,59716,3
59716,"I would like to give these a 2.5 star rating, but you can't give half a star on the reviews.",59716,3
59717,"Very satisfied with product, and would order again.",59717,3
59718,It fits Perfect.. Love it!!,59718,3
59719,Was not as nice as the picture and was too small.,59719,3
59720,"It was too small but love the suit, will order again in a bigger size.",59720,3
59720,It runs pretty small bit true to size,59720,3
59721,The waist was a bit slack but other than that it fit well although the material was not what I expected.,59721,3
59722,Too big on me.,59722,3
59722,"I ordered the black ones and they were perfect, but for some reason the gold run much bigger.",59722,3
59723,This is big and long however the top is small if you are big in the middle be prepared to struggle with putting it on once on it is super cute don't waste time thinking you will run to the bathroom and come back out it will take you a while,59723,3
59724,skirt fit perfect but the top not so much.,59724,3
59724,I am a busty girl so I know it was not the venders fault.,59724,3
59724,I would consider you boob size when you purchase this outfit.,59724,3
59724,otherwise it is really cute and good quality.,59724,3
59725,"Love this necklace, wear it daily and get compliments on how nice I smell (:

DID NOT COME WITH BAG OR FELT PADS -_-",59725,3
59726,CHEAP MATERIAL TOOOOOO SMAL,59726,3
59727,too small I passed them on to my sister-n-law,59727,3
59728,"I'm 5'2 weigh 140 pounds, it fit a little loose but the design is just like the picture..the colors are not as bright though",59728,3
59729,was hard not able to pick the color I wanted,59729,3
59730,"I bought this with the earrings and anticipated that it would be a great look with the red turquoise fashion ring, unfortunately, the coloring is not quite the same.",59730,3
59730,bracelet and the earrings are a lighter shading.,59730,3
59731,I'm not sure what I was expecting for the price but I would have figured the glue used to hold the faux turquoise stones in would have held in shipping.,59731,3
59731,I had to end up re-gluing 2 of the stones.,59731,3
59731,Looks better in pictures than it does in real life.,59731,3
59732,Doesn't retain its elasticity as well as i would like but it looks nice and was as expected when I received it .,59732,3
59733,Great look and feel just wish it was abit shorter,59733,3
59734,Fit well at first.,59734,3
59734,After wearing for a short time the heel continued to slip into the shoe...,59734,3
59735,"However, I feel strange on the same direction of both.",59735,3
59735,I suppose the two should in opposite directions.,59735,3
59735,"Anyway, it has been shown in Amazon's production picture.",59735,3
59735,That I had not carefully checked it.,59735,3
59736,Color and pants are amazing.,59736,3
59736,Only reason 3 stars is the back is fit to give you a wedgie it seems.,59736,3
59736,"My ass is nice and big, so anytime I wear it, the pants suck it in.",59736,3
59736,"Otherwise, I'm sure those who don't squat as much will love this.",59736,3
59736,I tried wearing it to the gym but the fit made it weird.,59736,3
59737,"Seemed like I was well made, and the color as nice, but very large.",59737,3
59738,Need it to be one size larger,59738,3
59739,"Very quick delivery, exactly like the pic on Amazon, but very small fitting!",59739,3
59739,I liked everything but the fit!,59739,3
59739,They need to make actually 2x shirts they run very small.,59739,3
59739,The 2x I ordered could fit a person wearing a medium or large.,59739,3
59739,Otherwise then that beautifully shirt.,59739,3
59740,Should have bought a medium!,59740,3
59741,"This top fits very baggy around the middle...which is okay, I suppose.",59741,3
59741,The sleeves are a bit tight.,59741,3
59741,"I ordered this top in Red...the package clearly states ""red"", however the shirt looks more orange.",59741,3
59741,"It's not worth returning the item over, because overall it's cute - but it is not a true red.",59741,3
59741,If you're looking for a nice red top...don't choose this one; you'll be stuck with a nice orange top instead.,59741,3
59742,"Cute dress, but bust area is cut too small!",59742,3
59743,"Fit is great but is not as ""poofy"" as I hoped.",59743,3
59744,It's a pretty dress but...,59744,3
59744,I wear a 14 and I ordered a 14.,59744,3
59744,While I was able to barely get into it it was clearly too small for me.,59744,3
59744,"Also, the neckline had a flaw, the fabric had flipped under and they sewed it down incorrectly.",59744,3
59744,It does look just like the photo.,59744,3
59744,Oh and yes it is very hard to zip up but I think if it hadn't been too small it would have been easier.,59744,3
59745,"I should have returned this we never used it, but at the time (Prom Season) we were so busy.",59745,3
59745,"My daughter is small and wears a ""0"" and is a senior and was not able to wear this due to it being too big and way to stiff.",59745,3
59745,The bottom would never lay down.,59745,3
59745,But since it didn't fit we didn't bother with it.,59745,3
59747,The backings don't stay on!,59747,3
59748,Not to fond of these swimmies.,59748,3
59748,They run a little small and the rubber i feel like it's too harsh on baby's skin,59748,3
59749,"Greener when I'm the shadows, brighter blue in the light.",59749,3
59750,the size was fine but the material is very thing.,59750,3
59750,Not what I expected for the price!,59750,3
59750,I would not buy it again,59750,3
59751,Purchased in a small and medium for fit and the medium had smaller sleeves than the small.,59751,3
59751,Shoulders just didn't lay right in either size.,59751,3
59751,I'm guessing it's probably hit or miss with this one.,59751,3
59752,Lens fell out second day I got them..,59752,3
59752,I like the way they look,59752,3
59753,"It fit okay, wish it was more lose",59753,3
59754,Its cheap but cute for lounging around the house,59754,3
59755,Great pants but they run really small.,59755,3
59756,"Really cute idea, and the pictures are beautiful.",59756,3
59756,It IS true to the pictures but is honestly a little lack luster in person.,59756,3
59756,Without all the pretty lighting and bright green nature backgrounds it's just a clear globe with a white dandilion petal(petal?).,59756,3
59756,"Anyway the concept is adorable, it's just not as beautiful on.",59756,3
59757,Asian sizes are smaller than Western ones.,59757,3
59758,I have another pair of these leggings and decided to order a pair in the print Clockwork.,59758,3
59758,I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the print.,59758,3
59758,It looked faded and almost pixelated.,59758,3
59758,"It might have just been a personal preference, but I returned them.",59758,3
59758,I would still considering buying another print though because I love my first pair so much.,59758,3
59758,"Definitely worth the price and the quality is great, just be careful what print you order.",59758,3
59759,I wear 34 B and I got medium and it fits great.,59759,3
59759,Should have listened to other reviews about the bottoms being a strange mix between cheekys and a thong.,59759,3
59759,Just makes my butt look like it's a can of busted biscuits.,59759,3
59760,"I am 5'7"" and it hits a couple inches above my knee.",59760,3
59760,Not flattering nor appropriate for a teacher.,59760,3
59760,Would work for a bathing suit cover-up.,59760,3
59761,My 22monyh old wears 18-24mos.,59761,3
59761,sizes and this was a bit too small.,59761,3
59761,"Also, no snaps at the crotch area so diaper changes would have meant a full undress!",59761,3
59762,"Got them for my girl,she got hells compliments",59762,3
59763,As the reviews state this does fit larger.,59763,3
59763,Go done a size or two,59763,3
59764,Runs way too small.,59764,3
59764,Photo is a comparison of a Walmart 5 t size.,59764,3
59764,I bought a size 7/8 size.,59764,3
59764,Fabric will most likely shrink a size after washing,59764,3
59765,Better than costume shirt,59765,3
59766,My 15 yr. old daughter loves the headband.,59766,3
59766,"However, it does give her a headache after wearing it for a bit.",59766,3
59766,One of the ears also came unattached from the headband itself after only wearing it a couple of times.,59766,3
59767,"nice, but detail makes little unclear what it really is- which is a volleyball",59767,3
59768,Did know it was gonna be so big I got an xL and it was way too long can't wear the feet on them because they are too big,59768,3
59769,"Cute, but fits small",59769,3
59770,run small in large,59770,3
59771,"They product was shorter in the front that expected, not necessarily small.",59771,3
59772,I loved the material and the length but they were 2 small I usually where a 2x,59772,3
59773,I ordered a beige color and ended up getting a deep pink one... very disappointed.,59773,3
59773,I'm on a time crunch for a wedding and now I need to keep searching.,59773,3
59774,Its really cute but ripped at the top with only wearing it 3-4 times.,59774,3
59775,Good hat just a little big,59775,3
59776,I normally wear a 1x in dresses and i ordered a 3x not made for a busty gal,59776,3
59778,The material is thinner than I expect and not helped by the small size of the sock.,59778,3
59778,I wear 6.5 women shoe and this is better suited for smaller feet than mine.,59778,3
59778,one sock already have runs in it after 2 wears.,59778,3
59779,It was a little too big for me and definitely too long I had to get them cut,59779,3
59780,Hard to rate here..,59780,3
59780,Product was flawless when I received it..,59780,3
59780,But I haven't even had it a month and it rusted super fast  Bummer.,59780,3
59782,Soft Leather means thin leather.,59782,3
59783,The dress is small and you should order two size up this why I give 3 star.,59783,3
59783,But it's really nice.,59783,3
59784,The dress is pretty but runs small.,59784,3
59784,That's the only reason for the three stars.,59784,3
59784,So I recommend ordering a size larger.,59784,3
59784,I hope this helps.,59784,3
59785,The shirt is made well.,59785,3
59785,The material is strong.,59785,3
59785,The holes for the rubber buttons a little hard to close.,59785,3
59785,The sleeves are longer than expected which creates bulk near the wrist area.,59785,3
59786,I'm 5'11 and needed tall sweatpants that would stay on.,59786,3
59786,"These are perfect in terms of height, but I'm not a fan of the material.",59786,3
59786,"I thought they would be a thicker, yoga-pants style cloth, but instead it's a thin, shiny material that I really wouldn't have purchased if I had known.",59786,3
59786,"They are comfortable though, and after several washes, the elastic is still doing its job and keeping the pants up.",59786,3
59786,"I'll get my use out of them, but would not purchase again.",59786,3
59787,"Not thrilled with these, but they're okay.",59787,3
59787,Pretty thin and a little big.,59787,3
59788,But it got big and droopy as I swam in the water.,59788,3
59788,Maybe I needed to order one size smaller.,59788,3
59789,"Kind of boxy, doesn't fit my body type well, however it could very well fit some other woman better.",59789,3
59791,"Love the hat, nice looking, good quality, but still can't decide if I like how it fits/looks when on.",59791,3
59791,The top portion seems to tall.,59791,3
59792,Looks a bit different in real life.,59792,3
59793,Size is smaller than given in description.,59793,3
59793,So was a little disappointment at first.,59793,3
59793,However liked it because it has more compartments.,59793,3
59795,didn't receive the cap but it was the right color and fit,59795,3
59796,This dress was just ok.  My main concern with this dress was that the beading and fabric look a little on the cheap side.,59796,3
59796,"I've certainly see worse, especially when it comes to beading, but I was hoping for something a bit nicer.",59796,3
59796,"I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this dress to a nice event - I think I would feel too cheap, even if the fit was stellar (which it was not...).",59796,3
59796,"I liked the back - the straps looked pretty - but the straps were a bit too spacious on me, so they ended up draping a bit.",59796,3
59796,"That said, I'm quite slender and small-busted so this might not be a problem for everyone (or for all sizes of the dress).",59796,3
59796,"Floor-length gowns tend to look good on me because I am long and lean (5'8, 115 lbs), but this style was not flattering for my body types.",59796,3
59796,The lack of defined waist made me look shapeless.,59796,3
59796,"Again, maybe not a problem for every body type though.",59796,3
59796,The dress does not flare out as in the photo.,59796,3
59796,It was more of a straight line with a subtle flare.,59796,3
59796,The model's stance makes it look like more of a mermaid style than it actually was.,59796,3
59796,Fit issues did not factor into my rating.,59796,3
59796,My rating was based only on the quality of the gown.,59796,3
59796,I just included fit comments in case they help someone else when making a decision about the dress!,59796,3
59797,I don't have a problem with the quality or fit of the hat... but I do have a problem with the color of the advertised hat.,59797,3
59797,The advertised hat shows a bright blue with black area where the Mustang logo is.,59797,3
59797,That hat is manufactured and provided by hotrodsplus.com and their website shows the color of the hat that I actually received as a dark blue.,59797,3
59797,Their website shows a picture of the color of the hat that matches what I received.,59797,3
59797,Hot Rods Plus does not even make a hat that matches the advertised color.,59797,3
59797,"I have no idea where they got the picture of the blue/black hat they use in their advertisement, but it should be changed to reflect what they really ship.",59797,3
59797,"I will keep the hat, but I would not have purchased it if I had known what the real color was.",59797,3
59798,"Meh-- the print up by the waist band looks totally fake, fine easily covered by a long shirt.",59798,3
59798,The color is doable.,59798,3
59798,The stretch to these is little to none.,59798,3
59798,-157lbs got a large and they are to tight..,59798,3
59798,I was really afraid I might tear them in I moved around in them.,59798,3
59798,Hardly any elastic or give.,59798,3
59798,Also wanted something more slimming and shaping.,59798,3
59798,These are not it,59798,3
59799,I bought these for ice fishing and my finger tips end up getting cold and too bulky to  have use of your fingers to bait hooks.,59799,3
59800,This was way too big for the 7 year old it was purchased for.,59800,3
59801,I bought these to wear to the Clemson National Championship Football game.,59801,3
59801,"Based on the size reviews, I bought a M/L.",59801,3
59801,I normally wear a size 4/6 pants.,59801,3
59801,They are big in the waist and I could have gotten away with a S/M.,59801,3
59801,The fit is loose enough so that I am able to wear another pari of regular cotton leggings underneath for warmth.,59801,3
59801,The material feels a little cheap.,59801,3
59801,"Overall, they work for what I need them for, but I will not be wearing them again.",59801,3
59802,Very pretty for sure- but definitely meant for someone with a larger nose or a longer face.,59802,3
59802,"I am a female with a small-ish nose, and this ring looks HUGE on my face.",59802,3
59802,"I absolutely love the opal stone, and the stainless steel was a big deal for me since I am allergic to most jewelry.",59802,3
59802,"I wish it was a little smaller, but otherwise, very cute.",59802,3
59802,I ended up giving it to a friend with a bigger nose and it looks great on her.,59802,3
59803,"I love this, but it only seems to stay untangle for 5 minutes at a time, and the metals has started to tarnish",59803,3
59804,"Great shoes, easy to put on and take off, sole completely tore away from shoe after 2 months of a 5 year old wearing them.",59804,3
59805,"It wasn't even the size I ordered, I ordered a medium and I got a large there was also a piece of the fabric that was all messed up, and no return address.",59805,3
59805,That was the first time I ever abought something from Amazon and it didn't work out.,59805,3
59805,Plus I can't even rate what I want it to.,59805,3
59806,Nice quality but too large for my heel to fit into.,59806,3
59806,Bummer as I got them for my wedding and was unable to wear!,59806,3
59807,I love the style and it is a good quality shirt.,59807,3
59807,"But as a person that usually wears small or medium sized shirts, this is way way too small.",59807,3
59807,I ordered a large to start with and it was like shrink wrap.,59807,3
59807,So I ordered the XXL and it fit but they sent me the wrong style.,59807,3
59807,I returned both and got a full refund.,59807,3
59808,Lost the bells right away.,59808,3
59808,I wouldn't buy again.,59808,3
59809,"Well I think their cute still but they are those ""seamless leggings"" with holes in them.",59809,3
59809,It wouldn't be a problem if they weren't pretty see through haha (but I also have a big butt).,59809,3
59809,"The holes were on the front on the pair I got, not the sides like the picture shown.",59809,3
59809,"They fit which is really good, but they definitely aren't great.",59809,3
59810,Top fits but in a weird way.,59810,3
59810,Bottoms entirely too small.,59810,3
59810,"Didn't cover ""the crack""",59810,3
59811,The dress is beautiful but it was too small.,59811,3
59812,Way too small did not fit me at all and I got a size bigger,59812,3
59813,Top fits too big then bottom fits too small ...,59813,3
59813,I got a different size than I wanted as well,59813,3
59814,"The necklace I received did not look like the one pictured, the one I got is the kind with the resin or epoxy over the picture of the shield.",59814,3
59815,"I did not realize that the ""Tops 2pcs"" would actually arrive as a shorts and blouse set, comprised of the teal-blue blouse and the cream shorts pictured.",59815,3
59815,"This surprise would have been pleasant if the shorts had fit, but my American curves are just a little too bootylicious.",59815,3
59815,"However, the XL blouse fit well enough - I am 5'8"", measurements 36-28-40, and usually wear a US size 4/6 in tops and an 8/10 in pants.",59815,3
59815,"The material feels like a thin treated linen and has a bit of a shine, but there are no labels (which is fine, as I usually cut out tags anyways).",59815,3
59815,"Until it is worn a few times and the stiffness of the fabric breaks down a bit, it will probably resemble a high end scrubs top.",59815,3
59815,"Pros:
-maybe actually linen
-true to color
-blouse true to sizing information
-minimalistic, clean design

Cons:
-comes as shorts and a blouse, not two blouses
-no way to select a different size for shorts",59815,3
59816,Black color is already fading.,59816,3
59816,"I've only washed it twice, and worn it twice since i got it.",59816,3
59816,"Could have been a better quality, but can't really complain because it was cheap.",59816,3
59816,Over all I still love it.,59816,3
59817,"I got this in the mail, reasonable shipping time.",59817,3
59817,Though it did look different than the picture a bit.,59817,3
59817,"The chain was darker and not as nice looking, and the back of the fish is a lot darker like the chain.",59817,3
59817,"The quality of it also doesn't feel very nice, but the fish itself is very cute.",59817,3
59818,really cute but the cup size is extremely small for an XXL,59818,3
59819,Well made and love the color super thin for the price.,59819,3
59820,the plastic buckle is a bit too hard to close but still a pretty good belt,59820,3
59821,"cute dress, just a lil on the small side...I am afraid to wash it.",59821,3
59822,"Ordered a size small based on the sizing guide on the products website, but it appears that it will be too large.",59822,3
59822,I guess we will see after I deliver!,59822,3
59823,It's super cute but too small!,59823,3
59824,"Nice color and pretty fabric but it is HUGE- it looks like a MOOMOO :( not at all flattering, Not sure how it looks so cute on the model?",59824,3
59825,This dress has a lot of potential if it was made a bit different.,59825,3
59825,"Ok, it's just a bit see through, but the problem is that the sleeves are too balky which makes the body unaltered.",59825,3
59825,I wish this dress had different kind of sleeves.,59825,3
59825,"The bottom part is nice and sexy, although you can't really see the leg as much as shown on the photo.",59825,3
59825,"At the end, I ended up retuning it.",59825,3
59826,"The style of these sweatshirts is nice, but they do not have the stretch of a traditional sweatshirt therefore they end up feeling restrictive, especially when putting them on and taking them off.",59826,3
59826,"I am typically size small, but ordered a medium due to recommendation (definitely need to size up AT LEAST one size) and while the overall fit ends up being fine, I was looking for a more comfy, stretchy, sweatshirt type feel so I returned.",59826,3
59827,"Looks great, but broke quickly.",59827,3
59827,"If you loose sunglasses on a daily basis like I do, these are perfect for you.",59827,3
59828,Disappointed that there is only two punisher costumes for women on Amazon.,59828,3
59828,Took a chance and decided to order.,59828,3
59828,"Costume looks exactly like the photo, however it is see-through.",59828,3
59828,Ladies you will need to wear a lot of under garments to fully cover up.,59828,3
59828,The material is very thin and does not hide any imperfections.,59828,3
59829,"This pill organizer is lovely, however it is large.",59829,3
59829,"I was wanting a smaller one to fit in a clutch or small purse, and this is not it.",59829,3
59829,"However, it does fit in a large purse and looks really cute!",59829,3
59830,The less expensive item was much better.,59830,3
59831,I bought this hat for my almost 2-month old nephew to wear to the beach this week.,59831,3
59831,"It arrived on time, and when we tried it on him, it absolutely swallowed him.",59831,3
59831,"He's a newborn, and I bought the hat in size newborn thinking it would fit.",59831,3
59831,Thankfully there is an elastic adjustment on the back and we were able to flip the front visor halfway up so he could see.,59831,3
59831,It's a very cute hat and has worked well for us this week.,59831,3
59831,It's help up its stitching and has been washed with no problems.,59831,3
59831,We'll just have to save it for our next beach trip when he's a little older.,59831,3
59834,I purchased both the black and gray Tank.,59834,3
59834,The gray fit as expected but the black was too short; it fit just at the beginning of my hips.,59834,3
59834,It is not long enough to wear with my tights.,59834,3
59834,I will wear the tank but not how I intended to wear them with tights.,59834,3
59834,I will have to layer more than what I anticipated.,59834,3
59835,Opened up the kigu with a ton of excitement but found there was a hole in the shoulder :/,59835,3
59836,"Little larger than a medium should be, in my opinion.",59836,3
59838,It was too short and didn't fit my large DD size boobs very well.,59838,3
59838,Yet it was too wide around the waist.,59838,3
59838,Will need to be tailored.,59838,3
59838,Awkward fit all together for my body type.,59838,3
59838,"(I'm a double zero with a 30-32 DD-DDD cup, avery size torso I guess).",59838,3
59839,Cute but has a funny smell even after washing.,59839,3
59840,"Didn't care for the padding in the bra, seem unnecessary in a comfort bra.",59840,3
59840,Runs small and was hard to get on.,59840,3
59841,"Came a bit larger, but overall really nice dress",59841,3
59842,The ring is just what I wanted the process to insure the engraving happen was a pain,59842,3
59844,Need one size down.,59844,3
59844,However since it's a swing style can make do if a little big,59844,3
59845,It's very cute and the colors are vibrant.,59845,3
59845,Only downside is the clasp is cheap and broke off maybe an hour after eating but it's a very simple fix by tightening it some.,59845,3
59846,Nice dress but fit too small.,59846,3
59846,Keeping it as incentive for losing weight.,59846,3
59847,Its ok...thought it was bigger but its very tiny.,59847,3
59848,"Fabric is a tad scratchy and stiff,hopefully after a wash it will be better.",59848,3
59848,it's also a little loose on me.,59848,3
59848,I expected more skin tight at the waist and maybe a tad longer.,59848,3
59848,The biggest problem I have with it is the sleeves.,59848,3
59848,"There isn't a lot of space in the arm pit area, so when I move my arms it feel a little constricted, and moves the whole upper dress around(stiff feeling) but it is still a cute dress",59848,3
59849,So I just recently purchased this and started using it and it fits perfectly!,59849,3
59849,Only problem is when you wash it couple of times the black starts fading out.,59849,3
59849,Other then that it works perfect for any events!,59849,3
59851,The dress was very nice but didn't fit.,59851,3
59851,I ordered XL but because the sequence was not stretchy I could not get it over my bust area.,59851,3
59852,Tassels were to long so I had to trim them.,59852,3
59852,Overall I like the top after I trimmed the tassels but not the bottoms.,59852,3
59853,Pockets hung in a strange way- but I altered them and it was fine but my son put a hole in the knee in gym class early on.,59853,3
59853,Seem a little thin - take that into consideration if you are buying for an active teen.,59853,3
59854,fits larger than expected.,59854,3
59855,Like the design but it's too short n look more like a nightgown,59855,3
59856,"It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, and the handles are a little bit shorter than I was expecting.",59856,3
59857,More white than ivory.,59857,3
59857,like the fabric and fits,59857,3
59858,I really tried to like this bag.,59858,3
59858,It has good features but it won't stand on its own when packed.,59858,3
59858,There needs to be a supporting foot on the bottom front side.,59858,3
59858,"Also, The handle collapses too easily.",59858,3
59858,I will keep though.,59858,3
59858,I have an elderly parent with health issues and I keep a bag of necessities packed and in my car for emergencies.,59858,3
59858,I'll use this bag for that.,59858,3
59859,"Very confusing to put on, but cute.",59859,3
59860,Looks great but I ordered two sizes to big and it's still a little tight.,59860,3
59860,I can work with though.,59860,3
59861,"Really thick material, looks and feels sorta like a diaper on your behind, but I still like it.",59861,3
59862,Thought it would be cotton like the pic.,59862,3
59862,Feels silky so am keeping it for a dressier look but still wish it were cotton for more casual wear.,59862,3
59863,I liked this bunting back because it seems soft and cozy.,59863,3
59863,"However, there's no way this is 0-12 months as the description suggests (which is perhaps a ridiculous expectations, thinking back...).",59863,3
59863,My average-sized boy 7 month old could barely be squeezed into it (having to smoosh him down a little to get the hood on.,59863,3
59863,Just to see if it'd fit).,59863,3
59863,I think it would be good for a 3-6 month range (or a pretty small baby.,59863,3
59863,"girls are a little smaller, so that range might be extended for a girl).",59863,3
59864,Overall I am happy with the purchase.,59864,3
59864,The shipping did take some time.,59864,3
59864,The sizing and fabric are my reasons for three stars .,59864,3
59864,The top fits very well however the bottom is quite small.,59864,3
59864,The fabric is a little scratchy and not very lacy.,59864,3
59864,The value was good however I would not repurchase .,59864,3
59865,This shirt is thin and the bottom hem rolls up const.,59865,3
59866,They are really hard to bend which may or may not be good for you.,59866,3
59866,I wished the opening was a bit smaller.,59866,3
59867,They are nice for a broach but way too big.,59867,3
59867,I thought they would be 2 inches but they are like 3 or 4 inches.,59867,3
59868,"I like the shoes because of the led lights,but they fit small I bought a 7.5 and it just fits me,I usually wear that size,so wish I got a half size bigger they are tight.",59868,3
59868,Also the charge last a few hours.,59868,3
59868,They are cheap looking I gave them to my daughter.,59868,3
59869,Thin and not what I hoped for but then it was cheap,59869,3
59870,"We had to return these because the ""small"" size is so large, it dwarfs my wife's face and glasses.",59870,3
59871,"a bit bigger, but since theres a stringer on it I can make it a bit smaller",59871,3
59872,I unfortunately followed the advice of others who bought this shirt and bought 2 sizes bigger because they said it ran small.,59872,3
59872,Now it's way too big!,59872,3
59872,So needless to say I'm not very happy!,59872,3
59872,I also ordered for 3 friends so now we'll all be swimming in our shirts!,59872,3
59872,I could have went with our normal sizes.,59872,3
59873,It fits nice on me but I didn't like the cloth material.,59873,3
59874,"I got the white one and, it is HUGE  gave 3 starts because the picture makes the clear beads look blue and that is what I thought I would get",59874,3
59875,"Good support, but not the right suit for me.",59875,3
59875,The support flattened my chest out to the sides and made me look like a blob....,59875,3
59875,Seller great to work with and I actually ordered another suit that was perfect.,59875,3
59876,They are pretty and stylish.,59876,3
59876,I bought them to wear in the house and look glam.,59876,3
59876,I went up a size because they are not wide.,59876,3
59876,But I am not a heal person.,59876,3
59876,I wear a chef's uniform everyday and these make me feel pretty.,59876,3
59876,My husband thinks they look pretty on me.,59876,3
59877,"Product not as pictured, but nice regardless.",59877,3
59877,"The chain is a gaudy yellow gold and I can't comment on the quality as I gave it away and replaced it with a longer more delicate gold chain, but the pendant is nice size and quality.",59877,3
59877,It's pictured as a gold pendant with a pale blue coloring around the outside.,59877,3
59877,"In actuality, the outside color is white.",59877,3
59877,"Although this is a big difference, the pendant is unique and distinctive from other st. christopher medals so I really like it and decided not to send back.",59877,3
59878,"They look lovely and came fast, just couldn't fit them..

Review update: I just recently lost some weight, so know I can fit them and let me say there adorable",59878,3
59879,"these sag at the knees to ankles , it appears they assume  your  calves would be same width as the thighs:-( won't order again .",59879,3
59879,"again maybe not understanding the sizing as I ordered by hip measurement  .the color is bright and comfortable material, without giving camel toe .",59879,3
59879,I wanted more of a  leggings fitted but denim material.,59879,3
59880,"They are nice, but there is no way they are 18 gauge; they are very small.",59880,3
59880,"Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.",59880,3
59881,Ordered two necklaces from this boutique and only got one Kendra Scott bag.,59881,3
59881,These were Christmas gifts for two separate people.,59881,3
59881,Each item should come with its own bag.,59881,3
59881,Necklace and price were ok. Next time I'll pay extra and order straight from Kendra Scott like I have done in the past.,59881,3
59882,Have had compliments on this and it fits well in a size smaller than I thought I'd need.,59882,3
59883,"Really nice fabric, great colors.",59883,3
59883,"Skimpy, odd cut for a toddler.",59883,3
59883,The cut makes them not fit properly.,59883,3
59884,"This is neon yellow, not just a primary yellow.",59884,3
59884,My husband and mother-in-law looked a little horrified when they saw me try it on.,59884,3
59884,"I think I'll use it for walks after dark, and for riding my bike to work.",59884,3
59884,I really wish it were a normal yellow.,59884,3
59884,"It's still pretty cute, but I wish it were a little bit longer.",59884,3
59884,It's not as long and narrow as it looks on the models in the photos.,59884,3
59884,"Also, be careful washing it.",59884,3
59884,"It picks up darker colors in the wash like a sponge, and yes  - I do separate lights and darks in the laundry.",59884,3
59884,I definitely don't recommend drying it in the dryer.,59884,3
59884,It will pill and shrink.,59884,3
59885,i sent it back.,59885,3
59885,Looked really cool but too big so I ordered something else.,59885,3
59886,Nice looking shirt but not the best quality,59886,3
59887,But I don't know why the color is different.,59887,3
59889,Did not fit shoulders and tummy area very well.,59889,3
59890,"Loved the style, but only in the picture.",59890,3
59890,Didn't meet my expectations.,59890,3
59890,"Was a tongue ring that looked great at first, but it bothered the top of my mouth, leaving it scratched sometimes.",59890,3
59890,"Then shortly after, the gem fell completely off, which made it even more of a bother.",59890,3
59890,"I was hoping it'd work out,",59890,3
59891,Is inexpensive and looks it.,59891,3
59891,It's $20 to return it so I'm keeping it.,59891,3
59891,I will never wear it.,59891,3
59892,One ball on each one came off in my sleep,59892,3
59893,Fits perfectly just not as cute a look as i thought it would be.,59893,3
59893,For some reason i thought it was a cotton shirt but its not.,59893,3
59894,I found this to be much too small.,59894,3
59894,"I bought a large which didn't fit at all, then I returned it for an extra large which just barely fits.",59894,3
59894,"I have never had an XL item that fit so tightly, all my other sweater vests are Large??",59894,3
59895,The chain faded quickly so if you purchase this make sure to get a different chain for it.,59895,3
59896,I got the 4T for my tall 16 month old.,59896,3
59896,These are really cute but the sizing is horrible.,59896,3
59896,My kid is pretty slim and they fit him perfect in the waist and tummy.,59896,3
59896,But the length is crazy long on the sleeves and arms.,59896,3
59897,Great fun for the price.,59897,3
59897,The front of the cap dropped lower than the hair--making a grey forehead---so I folded it once to hide the brim,59897,3
59899,I ordered the black and white and they sent me the multi color.,59899,3
59899,I was not pleased.,59899,3
59899,My daughter liked them anyways,59899,3
59901,But when i did have it it was very pretty,59901,3
59902,Kind of a goofy fit honestly.,59902,3
59902,Doesn't look too bad if I flip the brim and bend it.,59902,3
59902,The hat itself is just a little tall.,59902,3
59902,Also it's like thick headband inside for the sweat band.,59902,3
59903,This product fits great.,59903,3
59903,It is small so if you have big hands I don't recommend.,59903,3
59903,It is beautiful though.,59903,3
59903,But it is quite annoying because it breaks everytime I put it on or even pick it up!,59903,3
59903,It is a easier fix than some other jewelry though.,59903,3
59903,But it is definitely made with hot glue!,59903,3
59903,And that made me mad.,59903,3
59903,"It makes the product look cheap, and it is made poorly.",59903,3
59903,"So, the pros are that it is pretty and fits good.",59903,3
59903,"But the cons are that its VERY fragile, made with hot glue, only fits smaller hands.",59903,3
59904,I read the reviews to size up and it was too big!,59904,3
59904,I was stick with your size on this one.,59904,3
59904,The material is a little shiny even though it looks matte in the photo.,59904,3
59904,"The quality is just ok; I don't think it would last a lot of wears for multiple seasons, but for infrequent wear, it would probably be great.",59904,3
59905,I like the color and the padding.,59905,3
59905,"I was hoping it had a back and chest pad, but it does not.",59905,3
59906,My review acknowledges that the Kingsize products tend to cost a lot less than those from more 'premium' Big/Tall Men's retailers.,59906,3
59906,"Like all of my 5 other Kingsize polos, I purchased this on sale, as well.",59906,3
59906,"When the shirts arrive, the colors are rich and vibrant.",59906,3
59906,"However, after 5 or so washings, the colors tend to fade several shades...making them look much older than they are.",59906,3
59906,"In addition, the collars all get very limp and puckered after several washings...something even a good ironing won't completely remedy.",59906,3
59906,"However, the biggest single gripe I have with these shirts (and several sport/dress shirts I bought from Kingsize) is that they are stain magnets.",59906,3
59906,"It is almost impossible to avoid at least some hits on your shirt when eating spaghetti, or other foods with sauces/gravies...or, foods that are juicy and tend to spatter while being eaten.",59906,3
59906,"Whatever gets on these shirts, STAYS on these shirts.",59906,3
59906,It doesn't matter if you rub a freshly cut lemon wedge into the spots (that usually even keeps ink from setting into white shirts!,59906,3
59906,"), or immediately spray it with a pre-soak, or OxiClean solution.",59906,3
59906,The stain will remain.,59906,3
59907,I like the style and feel but can't keep the clip at the bottom from coming open.,59907,3
59907,I will keep it as a backup.,59907,3
59908,The sleeves were about an inch too short.,59908,3
59909,this product didn't fit at all but i do like the product just wish i could of got a bigger size,59909,3
59910,It's not the best quality but I mean you get what you pay for,59910,3
59911,"Cute, but very very small even with Asian sizing being considered.",59911,3
59911,Looks like the picture on my size 4/M shirt daughter- a bit small on me.,59911,3
59911,Worth the price though and well made.,59911,3
59911,3 stars for sizing.,59911,3
59912,"I ordered a size up, having read the reviews, but it is still too small for my 13-year-old son.",59912,3
59912,"I would like to return, but I ordered quite a bit before I gave it to him and missed the return deadline :(  He does love the way it looks, but he won't be able to wear it.",59912,3
59913,"The quality was not bad, but a little bit tight under the arms for me which makes it not as comfortable as I expected.",59913,3
59914,This is a very cute top and fits well!,59914,3
59914,"It's on the thinner side, needs to be hand washed and lay flat to dry.",59914,3
59914,"It does not seem very durable, hoping it will last for a couple of Halloweens.",59914,3
59914,"For the price, it's as expected.",59914,3
59915,"Beautiful dress, however, bra pads on dress are very noticeable.",59915,3
59915,Alteration to chest of dress will need to be altered.,59915,3
59915,"Other than that, a very pleased customer.",59915,3
59916,Pretty but do not like see-through back.,59916,3
59916,Not for my body type.,59916,3
59916,Material is pretty though.,59916,3
59917,"It is very pretty, but super see through in bright light.",59917,3
59918,Cute but not the best quality.,59918,3
59918,Leaves fluffy lint on everything it touches.,59918,3
59918,Toggle buttons are worthless.,59918,3
59919,"The gloves were super cute, I ordered an xtra large size and it was too small for me so I had to return them",59919,3
59922,I absolutely love the quality and fit of this jacket.,59922,3
59922,"The unexpected part was that the jacket was NOT hooded (in a traditional sense) and the jacket that arrived was grey, white and black...not grey, white, and blue like the photo.",59922,3
59922,"I had hope it would have been a nice match to wear with blue jeans, like the way it appears in the photos.",59922,3
59923,It's a little large in the hips so I am having it altered.,59923,3
59923,The package it came in was horrible it was just shipped in a bag.,59923,3
59923,So I will also have to have it steamed to get the wrinkles out,59923,3
59925,Not fond of the material,59925,3
59926,They wasn't what I thought I was looking for them to be bigger,59926,3
59927,"Actually a drop-waist skirt, but cute & lightweight.",59927,3
59927,Lace pockets are adorable.,59927,3
59927,Not sure if I'm keeping.,59927,3
59928,It's uncomfortable and gets hot make u sweat.it's like a polythene bag.not nice product,59928,3
59929,The dress is as described and really nice.,59929,3
59929,Its just cut too small!,59929,3
59929,Im a 14/16 and ordered the 14 and couldn't get in it!,59929,3
59929,"The sequins shed, but nothing major.",59929,3
59930,The blouse was not white as requested.,59930,3
59930,There was also an ink mark on collar.,59930,3
59931,I felt that there wasn't adequate compression.,59931,3
59932,Somewhat larger than my thumbnail.,59932,3
59933,The shirt is very nicely made and looks good.,59933,3
59933,"However, it is at least one size too small, and it is made of a synthetic material and not cotton as stated in the ad.",59933,3
59933,"Since I prefer the synthetic material to cotton, I'll give it a 3.",59933,3
59933,It was sent from China in the mail and took a month to arrive.,59933,3
59933,I have no idea how to return it.,59933,3
59934,I would say it's barely okay.,59934,3
59934,Very short both at the arms and feet yet it bulges out at the hip.,59934,3
59934,It must have been designed for Asian people.,59934,3
59934,"Too bad, otherwise it would be a comfy winter pajama set.",59934,3
59936,"I should've taken 2 sizes up, says 8-10 but fits like a 4-6",59936,3
59937,"Not really what I was expecting, based on the pictures.",59937,3
59937,"The length is great, skirt flair is lovely for hiding those hips, and the fabric has a nice amount of stretch to it.",59937,3
59937,"However, The V-neck is actually rousched panels, which bunched awkwardly, and didn't quite fit right.",59937,3
59937,"Shame, because the royal blue color is quite lovely.",59937,3
59937,"Had to return, unfortunately.",59937,3
59938,"Arrived earlier than expected, but even the largest version is a bit snug.",59938,3
59938,"I'm a big guy, 6'4"" & 250#- got some big boys, & this holds them securely but after a bit of wear becomes a little more snug than I'd like.",59938,3
59938,"Not a bad value for the price, just needs to be a bit bigger.",59938,3
59938,Maybe they'll stretch out a bit.,59938,3
59938,I do like the mesh- lets my boys breathe.,59938,3
59939,"This is VERY cheaply made, but considering I only paid something like 25 bucks, I wasn't expecting perfection.",59939,3
59939,The costume fits well and the mask is pretty comfortable.,59939,3
59939,The velcro attaching the Cape was unevenly sewn.,59939,3
59939,"One patch is on the left shoulder, but the other patch is closer to the neck.",59939,3
59939,The paint on the chest plate and other decorative areas are done pretty shoddy.,59939,3
59939,I don't expect this to be any more than a one time wear.,59939,3
59940,Inexpensive but looked great.,59940,3
59940,Perfect for what I needed,59940,3
59941,Not enough pouch for my package.,59941,3
59941,I'll convert it into a open bottom loincloth.,59941,3
59942,"The color is great, the material is ok.",59942,3
59942,"It's really high waisted and I feel like the waist elastic is very tight, I'm a slim 118 pounds women and always have a small, couldn't get larger because it's little loose at the legs, I would be happier with a more comfortable elastic, but I kept the pants anyway because of the nice color",59942,3
59943,The romper was cute... And nicely made..,59943,3
59943,Unfortunately it was way too short inseam.,59943,3
59943,"I'm  5'5"" and it neeeded at least 4 more inches to for my torso.",59943,3
59943,On the plus side it was super easy to return .,59943,3
59944,"I love the concept of this shirt, but the fit is off.",59944,3
59944,"I ordered a 3X, I typically wear an 18 and this just didn't fit right.",59944,3
59944,"I got it off and on with no problem, but it made my 38D breasts look like balloons sitting under my shirt.",59944,3
59944,It also wasn't as long as it appeared online.,59944,3
59945,"The fit is alright, skinny yet able to move freely; but I'm 4'11"" and the pants (size 0) are almost an inch and a half past my ankles.",59945,3
59945,"I have to cuff them to wear them, even with boots!",59945,3
59945,"They're nice pants otherwise, though!",59945,3
59946,Not really swim material more of a sundress...Doesnt support large boobied women andddddddd doesnt come with the bottoms,59946,3
59947,I really like the colour I was skittle upset able the way the inside of the jacket.,59947,3
59947,I purchased this for my Pokemon trainer cosplay and was hoping to put the badges inside the jacket however the seems and stitching aren't nice enough to want to show off :/,59947,3
59948,This lingerie/dress definitely stretched and I still had room to grow in it.,59948,3
59948,"I was expecting a more sturdy material and not fishnet, but the purpose was for it to be aesthetically pleasing and for my  husbands excitement.",59948,3
59948,"In that aspect, it definitely excelled.",59948,3
59948,"Overall, it'll serve its purpose.",59948,3
59950,Very nice run a lil small,59950,3
59951,Does not stay on kids feet,59951,3
59952,"I bought these necklaces a year ago and while I really love how dainty and feminine they are, I had initially bought five of the gold ones for myself and four friends to wear as friendship necklaces more or less and the gold all rubbed off and now they are silver.",59952,3
59952,They still look good and have held together well but I just wish that the gold coloring had stayed.,59952,3
59952,Not a single trace of it is gold but I still love it and wear it almost every day.,59952,3
59953,This jacket is pretty good.,59953,3
59953,"I only got it yesterday, but it was good for today (30degrees F).",59953,3
59953,I am really glad I ordered two sizes up.,59953,3
59953,"I usually am always a medium, but based on other reviews I decided to get two sizes up because I wear blazers and sweaters underneath my jacket usually.",59953,3
59953,I am really glad I did!,59953,3
59953,"Fits me well, being an XL and I was able to comfortably wear a blazer underneath.",59953,3
59954,Cute but a little too low-cut for me personally,59954,3
59955,The lace is soft but overall very uncomfortable.,59955,3
59956,These are novelty socks & they run very small.,59956,3
59956,I wear a size 12 shoe & I questioned if these were adult socks but I did manage to get them on.,59956,3
59956,A little more effort than usual to get them off.,59956,3
59956,"After washing, I pull & stretched them out; making the second wearing a little easier.",59956,3
59956,I do not expect to get more than half dozen wears out any of them.,59956,3
59956,I will probably not buy any more.,59956,3
59956,"But, they are fun.",59956,3
59957,I wear a 0 usually and ordered a 2 and it was TIGHT!....as in I couldn't really walk in it.,59957,3
59957,Definitely felt it was on the small side.,59957,3
59957,"For the price, it's not bad.",59957,3
59957,The train is long and beautiful.,59957,3
59957,You should note that you will probably need to wear another slip or liner or something under the skirt portion as the top and bottom are almost different colors because of how many more layers are on the bodice.,59957,3
59957,"Also, I bought thinking I could forego the belt, but you definitely need the belt as the seam is very obvious.",59957,3
59957,"Another thing is that the picture doesn't show the seams running down the front of the dress, but they are very much there.",59957,3
59958,Shrinks a bit in the wash,59958,3
59959,Pretty but not meant for large chest.,59959,3
59960,"These do not cover the entire visual field, leaving a significant gap at the bottom.",59960,3
59960,Normally this did not bother me.,59960,3
59960,"However, when hiking on stony terrain in bright sun, it became very difficult to see the ground ahead.",59960,3
59960,"The lower edge of the lens overlapped the ground between 6 and 15 feet ahead, making it difficult to see what was really there, which caused me to stumble several times.",59960,3
59960,I will never take these hiking again.,59960,3
59960,"For other uses, they are fine.",59960,3
59961,Colors are faded and the top was ittybitty and the bottoms were loose.,59961,3
59962,Nice but too tight around the hips and waist,59962,3
59963,"But for the price, I cant complain.",59963,3
59964,"Cute piece, if a bit on a cheap side, but that's what you get for the price.",59964,3
59964,"I was hoping that the wings would be spring-loaded or at least linked so that they open/close at the same time, but that's just not the case.",59964,3
59964,My daughter enjoys it and that's what really matters.,59964,3
59965,This top is a cute pink  but the material looks and feels like a nightie.,59965,3
59965,It is comfortable against the skin but I am not sure if i will be able to wear it out since it's see-through as well.,59965,3
59967,"cheaply made..no shape to the material,  very thin and see through.",59967,3
59968,Pretty solid but 100% doesn't block rfid but honestly really doesn't matter.,59968,3
59969,"It's  good, but I think it want more finishing",59969,3
59970,"This is an odd one... it fits around my head perfectly... but the depth is too shallow so I can't get it all the way down on my head without ""popping up"" the center area of the top of the hat.",59970,3
59970,I'm not trying to push it all the way down on my ears... just far enough that it fits comfortably and doesn't fall off.,59970,3
59971,"So pretty, but I'm 5'7"" and wear a 8/9 size, ordered an XL and the torso of the suit was way too short.",59971,3
59972,These fit great right out of the dryer and are so cute and super comfortable!,59972,3
59972,"However...they stretch out so badly :(
By the end of the day I have a super saggy pooch area on my behind and crotch.",59972,3
59972,Very unflattering and full-diaper looking.,59972,3
59973,This is very large for me.,59973,3
59973,I had buy a smaller.,59973,3
59974,to big so we havnt worn it yet,59974,3
59975,Way too thin and plan to go up a few sizes,59975,3
59976,I was confused with the strings on the side at first but it turns out you have to cut it to your measurement.,59976,3
59977,"First impression trying it on, it's cute enough, looks and fits like the picture... then I washed it.",59977,3
59977,"The strip of plaid fabric at the bottom shrunk about 2"", changing it from a cute work-appropriate dress to a casual tunic I will wear with bike shorts or leggings.",59977,3
59977,"I like the look, but I wasn't expecting too much of Romwe quality, since I have purchased from this seller before.",59977,3
59977,"The top is very soft, very light, comfortable material, but the plaid at the bottom is so cheap... don't buy this if you don't own an iron to put the pleats back into it!",59977,3
59979,Very very small even though ordered two times larger then regular size.,59979,3
59980,"NOt a very good quality, it looks prettier on the website.",59980,3
59981,Great quality hat the fur is great and warm.,59981,3
59981,"But the sizes are not consistent, my dog chewed up my first one that fit perfect so I ordered the exact same hat color and size and the new one is too small it hurts my head.",59981,3
59981,It's labeled the same size as old one,59981,3
59982,Beatifull but Is for womans,59982,3
59983,"I am satisfied with my purchase, but the model picture makes it seem more like these are thigh-highs rather than knee-highs.",59983,3
59983,I was hoping the socks would reach further up my leg.,59983,3
59983,"As of now, they reach to just at and a little over my knees.",59983,3
59983,The material seems thick and of decent quality.,59983,3
59983,The 'manufacturing' smell was pretty strong when they arrived.,59983,3
59983,"After a few washings, I can tell that the smell is starting to go away.",59983,3
59983,Shipping was relatively quick.,59983,3
59984,"Its comfrontable, too large for me.",59984,3
59984,But i am 5 2 and it hangs way down to my knees.,59984,3
59984,I wear for just aaround the house but it looks to slumpy.,59984,3
59985,"CHAIN on purse is weird .. its a bit cheesy,,but hey, I ordered it....smh..",59985,3
59986,So so if polarized would be great I do love the frames,59986,3
59987,"It's not as Shiny as the one in the pic , the nose and forehead were scratched !",59987,3
59987,I DO LIKE THE SHAPE,59987,3
59988,This suit runs small!,59988,3
59988,I usually wear an xsmall -small bottom and a small top.,59988,3
59988,"I bought a medium due to the other reviews, which was a smart move!",59988,3
59989,It had a slight order.,59989,3
59990,Socks are a little tight,59990,3
59991,smaller than i thought,59991,3
59992,A large fits like a small,59992,3
59994,Fits well but doesn't entirely look like the photo but I still enjoy it very much,59994,3
59995,Almost too uncomfortable to wear all day.,59995,3
59995,Maybe be good for sports activities or something like that.,59995,3
59995,I am a medium and i think I needed an XL.,59995,3
59995,Not comfortable for american men.,59995,3
59996,"Different but small, but fill's in small spaces.",59996,3
59997,"I really do not know anything about this product I sent it as a Baby GIFT
& so far I haven't heard if they liked the items or not?",59997,3
59997,"I just marked 3 stars otherwise
one can't write an review.",59997,3
59998,This shirt is cute off but tight on.,59998,3
59998,Must be made in foreign country were sizing is different!,59998,3
59998,I'm not big boned either average to small.,59998,3
59999,Beautiful but pearl beads dropped because threading was mot secured do my purse has spaces where the workmanship caused  loose thread,59999,3
60000,"This sweatshirt came on time and looks great, great quality.",60000,3
60000,I ordered a large and it doesn't feel like a large.,60000,3
60000,"It fits very snug, perhaps I should have ordered an extra large",60000,3
60001,Cos wasn't what I expected,60001,3
60003,"Was hoping it'd be looser fitting like shown, but it's fairly tight.",60003,3
60004,"I love the top but it is very tight, I whish our clothing would be available in the proper sizes.",60004,3
60004,"A large used to be a large, a medium a medium etc.",60004,3
60004,Now a days a size large is actually only a small.,60004,3
60004,For this reason I'm only giving 3 stars.,60004,3
60005,It did not look exactly like the picture.,60005,3
60005,"The straps were way too long for me, even after adjusting them to the shortest length.",60005,3
60005,I am not a small person.,60005,3
60005,The only reason I did not return it was because my husband said he would take it.,60005,3
60006,not sure they are helping much with my carpal tunnel post surgery pain.,60006,3
60006,It's only been a week though so I am continuing to wear.,60006,3
60007,Quality is very good but the sizing is on the small side.,60007,3
60008,The wallet itself is what you expect.,60008,3
60008,"But when you checkout with a green wallet, and a blue one is on your tracking information and arrives.",60008,3
60008,It's kind of disappointing.,60008,3
60009,At first they were great but we bought them so our son (10 months) wouldn't scratch his face and he rubs his face with them on and the edges of the Velcro have cut his face all over.,60009,3
60009,He rubs his face all night and he found him all scratched up on top of all of his eczema :(,60009,3
60010,"They fit fine in the butt and waist, but were very very tight in the calves and through the knees.",60010,3
60010,Also according to the size chart I would need a size 3 but I ordered a size 7 and they fit through the waist and hips but were tight in the lower legs.,60010,3
60011,Love the sweatshirt but way too small and I ordered two sizes larger than I wear,60011,3
60012,soft fabric but seem small,60012,3
60013,It's not as green as the picture shows.,60013,3
60013,It's more of a dark mint almost faded green.,60013,3
60013,It fits good up top to me due to I have a smaller chest than most but the waist portion is really snug.,60013,3
60014,Didn't quite fit as expected was a little larger than the size was.,60014,3
60014,Didn't git my little cousin for  the outfit I bought it for.,60014,3
60015,"Cute top, but it's huge and long!",60015,3
60015,"I usually wear a Med, but figured a large might work.",60015,3
60015,Besides that the top is good!,60015,3
60016,Fades a lot after a few washes,60016,3
60017,The quality is not the best.,60017,3
60018,This shirt is very small.,60018,3
60018,It literally looks like a child sized garment.,60018,3
60018,The style and workmanship is fine but runs very small,60018,3
60019,"The color shown in the picture is not the actual color of the tie, at least to my eye.",60019,3
60019,"I was hoping to receive an olive-green tie, but what I received was more of a lighter lime-green.",60019,3
60019,"Still, the tie is not bad by any means.",60019,3
60019,"The material is okay, but nothing fancy.",60019,3
60019,"Not great, but not bad.",60019,3
60019,"It was cheap anyway, so I can't say I'm too unhappy with the purchase.",60019,3
60019,Just know that what you will receive will be lighter than what is shown in the picture.,60019,3
60020,I bought these shoes to replace my old UA basketball shoes.,60020,3
60020,My old shoes fit perfect so I ordered the same size.,60020,3
60020,These shoes are smaller and narrow.,60020,3
60020,I guess they vary from style to style.,60020,3
60020,"It's hard to recommend anything since my last shoes fit fine, but this particular style runs small.",60020,3
60021,This outfit arrived and it was too small for my son.,60021,3
60021,"Instead of going through the hassle of returning it, it went into the youngest son's clothes pile for him to be able to wear it in a couple years.",60021,3
60022,not too true to size... but top was ok,60022,3
60023,"So, its a very cute suit.",60023,3
60023,"Unfortunately, the bust area is way too big for me so I can't wear it.",60023,3
60023,Its kind of a firm cup that would stick out if you don't have big enough bust to fill it out.,60023,3
60023,"I love the boy short bottom, so its disappointing the top doesn't fit",60023,3
60024,Skirt was too long.,60024,3
60024,"I couldn't wear it, and It wasn't like the picture.",60024,3
60024,There are not any turquoise swags flowing loosely like in the picture.,60024,3
60025,These were a bit small and did not hold up in dryer.,60025,3
60026,THIS GAVE US A GREAT LAUGH WHEN IT TRIED IT ON!,60026,3
60027,Nice item for the money.,60027,3
60027,Arrived quicker than expected!,60027,3
60028,"Bottoms run a lot smaller than the top, the bottoms fit perfectly while the top fits a bit big, the seams were a bit ripped but nothing I couldn't fix!",60028,3
60028,"I adjusted the top to my liking but I didn't mind, love the bathing suit so much just wish I didn't have to work for it",60028,3
60029,The dress fits nicely and has a cute flow but I will not be able to wear this dress unless it is as a cover-up for a swim suit.,60029,3
60029,It is so clear you can totally see ones underwear.,60029,3
60030,It's a good product but I didn't use it nearly as much as I expected.,60030,3
60030,I ended up just buying stretchy maxi skirts for $10 each and some maternity pants.,60030,3
60030,It stays in place well when you're standing since it has those grip strips.,60030,3
60030,"However, if you have a desk job and you sit down and stand up a lot you will find yourself constantly adjusting it.",60030,3
60030,It's also summer in AZ and it's bad enough being pregnant.,60030,3
60030,Add another layer of something and it's sweaty and uncomfortable.,60030,3
60030,I could see it working better in the winter.,60030,3
60031,The sleeves were too tight!,60031,3
60031,and I do not have very big arms,60031,3
60032,"I am 5 feet and 4 inches tall, 113lb, I bought medium size.",60032,3
60032,"It fits overall except the waist position of the dress is higher, therefore I could not wear the belt, because it looks odd the belt is put under the waist line of the dress.",60032,3
60032,I think this is because the dress is designed for Asians.,60032,3
60032,"The material is good, but the sewing is bad, many stiches are loose , not aligned well",60032,3
60033,"The picture shows green eyes , but they are yellow.",60033,3
60033,I ordered it because it looks just like my cat (green eyes).,60033,3
60033,I was very disappointed when  I saw the yellow eyes.,60033,3
60034,"OK, this is a very flattering cut, fit as expected and has a sexy low cut.",60034,3
60034,"The style is really, really cute.",60034,3
60034,"That said, the material is on the cheap side, which isn't acceptable for a tiny 40 dollar shirt!",60034,3
60034,"I really like it, but will probably return it, because i don't think the material will stand the test of time.",60034,3
60034,"Also to note, the blue polka dot shirt does not have the black accents around the neck and sleeves as shown in the picture.",60034,3
60034,"Overall, cute but disappointing.",60034,3
60035,I wouldn't wear this out of the house.,60035,3
60035,"And the material is that thin clingy type, so my post partem body was not working with this!",60035,3
60036,A lot thinner and cheaper looking than what I thought.,60036,3
60036,It would have been nice if it came with one or two pads to pour oils on.,60036,3
60037,My daughter (3 years old) couldn't get her finger in them :(,60037,3
60038,"Round bead is plastic, though.",60038,3
60038,"We were giving this for a gift, so now have to go find a brass bead to replace it.",60038,3
60039,Product was more of a greenish black color in person and was slightly larger size then what I was expecting (shirt looks slim fit in the picture and is not in person).,60039,3
60039,The material is pretty thick so that is a plus just the color is a little odd.,60039,3
60041,Pretty cheaply made but I still like it.,60041,3
60041,Too bad there were no earrings to match.,60041,3
60042,"It's ok, for the price...you get what you pay for...",60042,3
60043,The image has begun to wear off after having washed it about 6 times.,60043,3
60046,It's a bit small for me.,60046,3
60046,I'm around 38B and some Cs.,60046,3
60046,"It stays on when lifting arms, but feels like it could easily break if straps are pulled.",60046,3
60047,I only gave it one star because it fit me.,60047,3
60047,"Since my baby gas sensitive skin, I have to wash all of my clothes before I let him near me.",60047,3
60047,After the FIRST AND ONLY wash the bottom seam came off and the camisole was ruined.,60047,3
60047,The material construction is very poor quality.,60047,3
60047,"Update:
The seller has contacted me regarding my purchase and has offered me a full refund even though it was damaged.",60047,3
60047,They have great customer service.,60047,3
60048,A bit too long.,60048,3
60048,There is only a strip of actual animal print.,60048,3
60048,Far less than anticipated,60048,3
60049,"I ordered a medium and and i am a 32 C the cups fit nicely, abd suuppperr cute however the strapps were way to long to even stay on to i had to sew it but overall nice product",60049,3
60050,"The top fits well, the bottom not so much.",60050,3
60051,"Runs small, especially under the arms...even though the shirt is sleeveless.",60051,3
60052,"Hat gets 5, very well made, but USPS must of had something against Trump.",60052,3
60052,"It was 4 days late with a prime membership, and had a black tracking line and a warning sign.",60052,3
60052,What was that about?,60052,3
60053,It was for my daughter.,60053,3
60053,"She like it but, sadly the dress runs very small.",60053,3
60054,"Was hoping it would be more flowing, more fabric.",60054,3
60055,Waaaay too small but simple return process.,60055,3
60056,"it okay, material not as soft as expected.",60056,3
60057,Ordered a Large for 151 lbs me.,60057,3
60057,The upper band doesn't hold up too well during workouts though.,60057,3
60058,"fit very well for the first couple of times, after that one of the silver hooks broke off & that was the end of it.",60058,3
60058,Cheap product made cheaply so I really didn't expect it to last long.,60058,3
60059,"I ordered another shirt from their website, size medium, and that one fits nicely.",60059,3
60059,Print is a little faded but it doesn't look bad.,60059,3
60060,This is pretty loose on my head.,60060,3
60060,I am a small person but one fits all usually works.,60060,3
60060,It is a pretty hat and well priced so I have kept it as it will work if it's not too andy and it rarely is out here.,60060,3
60060,perfect to keep you  hair dry between the stores and your car.,60060,3
60061,"These alligator pajamas are pretty adorable, but the color faded after a couple washes.",60061,3
60061,Our 14 month old is in the 10th percentile for weight and these fit her on the small side so I would recommend you order a size up.,60061,3
60062,"It looks good, but it doesn't stay as two strands on my neck they usually fuse into one.",60062,3
60063,"Pretty top, if it will stay put!",60063,3
60063,"The elastic is pretty snug, and my shoulders are a bit broad, so I have a hard time keeping it off the shoulder.",60063,3
60063,"When it rides up, it looks pretty silly.",60063,3
60063,"I've clipped some of the elastic to loosen it up, and it's better... Will probably keep working on it.",60063,3
60063,"Fabric is nice and lightweight, but doesn't breathe.",60063,3
60063,"Color is lovely, tie detail in sleeves is cute, and the medium is quite roomy.",60063,3
60063,"I'm normally an 8-10, and there's plenty of room in the medium.",60063,3
60063,I'd have given 4-5 stars if only I could keep the off the shoulder top off if my shoulders!,60063,3
60064,Received it and wasn't able to put it in myself.,60064,3
60064,When to the person who does piercings and she struggled to close it.,60064,3
60064,After 10 minutes working at it she got it to close.,60064,3
60064,At this point now I can't get it to open to remove it.,60064,3
60064,Not quite sure how I'm going to get it out now?!?,60064,3
60065,Shirt was not true to size.,60065,3
60065,Ended up being too big,60065,3
60066,the dress is beautiful and wonderfully made but the fabric is unforgiving and the fit is a little small.,60066,3
60067,Too small but I will make it as a gift for someone smaller.,60067,3
60068,"The top just fit, but bottoms are too small.",60068,3
60068,One of those products that you need a size up in.,60068,3
60069,Order 2 sizes up from what you normally order.,60069,3
60070,Im a small size and i order a large and it did not fit me!!!,60070,3
60070,Btw the shipping was fast :),60070,3
60071,The bottoms don't come up as high as in the picture which is one of the reasons I bought it.,60071,3
60071,The fringe is nice and fairly evenly distributed.,60071,3
60071,If you have a pooch stomach the fringe isn't gonna camouflage or distract from it in your side profile because they don't come down far enough.,60071,3
60071,Another reason I bought it.,60071,3
60071,I plan on buying a rushed tube top to wear under this to help with a side profile.,60071,3
60071,I still think it's worth buying because the front does look good and it's cheap but it's not quite as awesome as a plus size bathing suit as I hoped it would be.,60071,3
60072,Ordered a medium and should have gone larger.,60072,3
60072,There's not much give in the crotch and the mesh is not made for ample containment.,60072,3
60072,"Basically hung dudes beware, if you've got a big dong or big low-hangers, these briefs will squash you almost to an uncomfortable degree.",60072,3
60072,I tried these on immediately and it felt like I was forcing my junk through wire mesh.,60072,3
60072,The good news is I got this pair for a costume where the crotch is cut out.,60072,3
60072,Thankfully the seams on either side allow the crotch fabric to be cut without the entire thing coming apart.,60072,3
60072,Once the crotch was gone it made it a lot more comfortable.,60072,3
60072,"So if you're planning on wearing these as they are made and you've got a big package, order larger, you'll thank me.",60072,3
60073,they were too high in the back to where they created 2 blisters on my ankle within 20 minutes of wearing them.,60073,3
60073,Once i put clear bandaids on the backs of my heels they were perfectly fine and didn't really cause a problem the rest of the day.,60073,3
60074,"The reason I'm rating 3 starts is because the item arrived fast but it's too large for me, I was expecting this fits like the picture show; I guess I am not too tall just 5'2 maybe an xs would fit better, and it's too wide in my opinion, maybe someone like very wide clothes, it just fits in me like L or XL , probably with a belt  looks better, I will get someone to fix it for me, maybe I change my mind and I will update this rating.",60074,3
60074,"Oh something else I would like to add is that the material is nice and soft but you will see your panties, and another thing I like is the color.",60074,3
60074,Probably this is a dress just to wear in the beach.,60074,3
60075,Ther is missing one buckle OF the sleeve,60075,3
60076,Way smaller than expected according to their charts.,60076,3
60076,Didn't open til after Christmas so I am stuck with it.,60076,3
60076,"On the other hand, it was made well.",60076,3
60076,A nice addition to the donation bin at church.,60076,3
60077,Very cute but did not hold up after washing.,60077,3
60077,Tore easily on the lace.,60077,3
60078,Dress was pretty color but there was no zipper only a lace up corset I didn't like that way to easy to open,60078,3
60079,"It runs small, which is not the style I like.",60079,3
60079,The shipping was super quick and the item came exactly as described.,60079,3
60080,its very roomy but it is very large so I recommend order the right size bc its more like a mini dress lo but very thin I like it but not what I wanted not worth 20$,60080,3
60081,"We first got the wrong item, a pair of pants.",60081,3
60081,But soon after I reported the problem with a photo the correct item was sent.,60081,3
60081,It was handled very well.,60081,3
60081,The item itself is made of a shinny cheep fabric but still is ok.,60081,3
60081,The problem is it is very tight on my 13 who is small chested and only wears a small/medium shirt normally.,60081,3
60081,So now she is deciding about trying to add some fabric on the sides ourselves so its not so form fitting or give it to a friend who is a extra small.,60081,3
60081,Very bummed that it is way to small.... Its too bad as I might of got her a couple more.,60081,3
60083,Better than quality than the original.,60083,3
60083,Color was a darker brown than expected and not the olive brown like seen in the photo.,60083,3
60084,"It's cut differently so it doesn't fit straight on me, I will have to wear a blazer over it",60084,3
60085,"It's better to just get an expensive ring resized, but for the cheaper rings, this is okay.",60085,3
60085,"It likes to pinch at the skin a lot, and the sharp edges hurt after a while of continued wear.",60085,3
60085,I would recommend this product for temporary wear.,60085,3
60086,Arrived in good condition for the price but the shoe was too big for my baby's feet.,60086,3
60086,Maybe consider buying a size down.,60086,3
60088,"It was really nice and my wife loved the style and design, but simply too small.",60088,3
60089,Its really pretty just kind of thin to be honest,60089,3
60090,Love the shirt but it is way smaller than I thought.,60090,3
60090,I purchased an XL and normally wear a medium.,60090,3
60090,it fits but is tight.,60090,3
60091,Costume was great looks great fit great but I wasn't happy when I didn't get the orange flower,60091,3
60092,It is pretty thin for a robe.,60092,3
60092,"The pockets are past the hips so unless you have a long torso, you will need to reach down for the pockets.",60092,3
60093,Perfect I love it,60093,3
60094,Really gorgeous fabric and a lovely style.,60094,3
60094,The colors are beautiful.,60094,3
60094,In the photo it looks as if there's more fabric for a fuller cut.,60094,3
60094,It also looks longer in the photo.,60094,3
60094,"I've been disappointed in several articles I've bought so it's OK. Again I bought the largest size they have but it's still too small, and I'm not large.",60094,3
60094,I'll wear it but I won't be buying from any of these vendors again.,60094,3
60095,Would have been a 10 but the proportions are off.,60095,3
60095,Sits a little too deep and the frontal part of the cap is like a high dome after the vertex/top sits on the apex of your head.,60095,3
60095,Still a good purchase but would have really raved about this hat if the proportions were better crafted.,60095,3
60096,Interesting design but cuts small around the hips and I got a large and am a size 6.,60096,3
60097,Cheaply made but cute.,60097,3
60098,It was made well but it just didn't work for me.,60098,3
60099,In the pic the shirt looks like it is a tight fitting shirt.,60099,3
60099,The material has no stretch to it and hangs loosely on my body.,60099,3
60100,Let me start by saying that this is the best bag you'll get for this price.,60100,3
60100,I use it as my day bag for all my diabetic supplies and such.,60100,3
60100,"It's held up very well after my months of use, however the liner started slightly coming undone after the first month and a half.",60100,3
60100,I take this bag everywhere and it is fashionable and very functional!,60100,3
60100,"I would recommend it, even with the lining having come undone slightly!",60100,3
60101,The crown is deep enough but the brim isn't as wide as I imagined from the photo.,60101,3
60101,No ventilation holes at all.,60101,3
60101,Made in and shipped directly from China.,60101,3
60102,I wish it was taller...and it would be nice if it covered more of my back,60102,3
60103,"I loved the look of this tunic, but unfortunately it was not sewn correctly.",60103,3
60103,"One side was over an inch shorter than the other side and it didn't look right, so I returned it for a refund.",60103,3
60103,This may have ben a problem only with this particular tunic.,60103,3
60104,The reviews mentioned that Sizes 12 to 14 is a large.,60104,3
60104,My sister is a 12 but too small for her.,60104,3
60104,This was a birthday gift and I felt bad.,60104,3
60104,Just don't want to take the time to return it.,60104,3
60105,"Like the tights, read the reviews and I should have stayed true to size instead of going a bit smaller.",60105,3
60106,These jackets  are too tight at the bust and are too short,60106,3
60108,"It's cute, but it fits a little small.",60108,3
60108,"The skirt is nice and long though, which I enjoy",60108,3
60109,Tangles very easy would only buy if you're extermly careful,60109,3
60110,The suit fit as expected but I had to return it due to the front tie stitched to the inside of the suit.,60110,3
60110,This suit made it past the inspectors.,60110,3
60111,I bought these to replace a pair of Bolle Parole Tennis sunglasses.,60111,3
60111,"When I wore them, they were too small and they didn't provide the coverage that the Parole model did.",60111,3
60111,I could see the bottom of the frame in my field of vision while on the court.,60111,3
60111,I returned them and purchased another pair of Bolle Parole which I am very happy with.,60111,3
60111,"I should have stayed with the ""tried and true"" model which I have worn for at least 10 years.",60111,3
60111,They are the best and the teal lenses make the tennis ball stand out.,60111,3
60112,Smaller then I thought it would be but looked like the pic,60112,3
60113,"Very pretty, but the size I normally wear doesn't zip  Order a size larger",60113,3
60114,so the vest itself was very good quality but i orderedan xl and thecompany shipped me out a medium.,60114,3
60114,"If i had gotten the right size, it would have been a 5 star review.",60114,3
60115,"The dress had some hanging strings and the neckline was cut deeper than I expected, but other than that it's perfect and not tight at all.",60115,3
60115,Just a little too short.,60115,3
60115,I'm 5'2 135 pounds and ordered a medium.,60115,3
60116,"I love the look, it is a bit large but it had a strong smell.",60116,3
60117,Very thin material but I knew that from the reviews.,60117,3
60117,I bought a size up and it fits fine.,60117,3
60118,I bought this for my daughter.,60118,3
60118,"It was beautiful, but much too small.",60118,3
60118,We had to send it back.,60118,3
60119,"Nice hoodie, but the one shipped to me was Pine, not charcoal.",60119,3
60120,I'm a huge Loungefly fan and love Star Wars so I HAD to have this bag.,60120,3
60120,"It's so cute and well constructed, but unfortunately the printing on the outside has started to wear off in a few spots around the zipper/handles from use.",60120,3
60120,"I love the bag, but I'm just a little disappointed with the quality of the printing.",60120,3
60120,"It still looks pretty good after a month, so I don't want to knock the rating too low.",60120,3
60120,Overall I love it!,60120,3
60120,"Just not what I'd call an ""everyday carry.""",60120,3
60121,The fit is different from the NYDJ jeans I own in the same size and style.,60121,3
60122,"love the dress, BUT runs very large, I should have listened to reviews",60122,3
60123,"very pretty top, but too tight for me.",60123,3
60124,The bottom is see through....NOT GOOD for wearing anywhere except a nude beach.,60124,3
60125,"Colors really faded after one wash,,,,did not use bleach either.",60125,3
60126,I'm giving three stars because the frames were perfect and exactly what I was looking for BUT the glasses are too wide so they keep slipping off of my face.,60126,3
60126,If they hugged my face more then I would've rated 5 stars but unfortunately I cannot wear these without them slipping or falling off so three stars.,60126,3
60127,Short in the arms but overall very warm!,60127,3
60127,Used for MN winter this year and my head was nice and toasty.,60127,3
60127,"Some of the fluff from the inside does come through the stitching or out of the pocket, so you'll have some weird white sprouting puff balls (which you'll be used to if you're in your late 40's, but maybe not so much on your palms) so could be better.",60127,3
60128,Works pretty well but the hinge is weak and breaks after a few months of use.,60128,3
60128,It is a design flaw.,60128,3
60129,Very beautiful skirt but the waist is smaller than expected.,60129,3
60129,Also the skirt itself is very puffy due to the darting.,60129,3
60129,If you're ok with that then you'd love it.,60129,3
60129,It's not very casual due but pretty for a girls lunch.,60129,3
60129,I'd love to reorder this in a bigger size but I just don't know how much I'd wear it bc it is so puffy.,60129,3
60130,Posts are not centered and arrived bent,60130,3
60131,Wish top was darker would not buy again.,60131,3
60132,The quality of the shirt is fine.,60132,3
60132,"As others have noted, it is cut oddly through the chest and armholes.",60132,3
60132,"I had it tailored to fit, which was an unanticipated extra expense.",60132,3
60133,"Cute but only long enough as a shirt...I'm 5'7""",60133,3
60134,I love the size and style of this bag.,60134,3
60134,It's purpose is to be my go to wristlet for a night out.,60134,3
60134,"Plenty of room for phone, cards, cash, keys, and girly essentials.",60134,3
60134,Simple enough to go with Smyth outfit.,60134,3
60134,"But, I only gave it 3 stars for a reason.",60134,3
60134,It has an awful smell.,60134,3
60134,I can't describe the exact smell it reminds me of as it probably would not let it post.,60134,3
60134,I washed it and still didn't go away.,60134,3
60134,"I had an inexpensive purse not long ago with the same odor, got rid of it due to not being able tolerate it.",60134,3
60134,Now I'm stuck with this bad with the same smell.,60134,3
60134,I'm pretty sure it's because of the cheap inner lining/materials.,60134,3
60134,I don't know what else to do with it.,60134,3
60134,I don't want to go out and have people think the smell is coming from me,60134,3
60135,I like the quality of the piece but  it is missing a part one of the Silver Nails is missing on the left side of the cross,60135,3
60136,I treated with scotch guard to keep dry.,60136,3
60137,I bought these to go with supergirl halloween costume.,60137,3
60137,They are perfect in regards for that use.,60137,3
60137,"Very bright lights, and granddaughter loves them.",60137,3
60137,I would order up a size though.,60137,3
60137,The sketcher brand shoes are large on my grandchild....these barely fit and are tight.,60137,3
60138,Fits tight in the shoulders.,60138,3
60138,The material starts to pill up after a few washings.,60138,3
60138,The stitching is sloppy in some areas.,60138,3
60139,Nice to wear under clothes for a smooth look.,60139,3
60140,Really expensive for a pair of long socks.,60140,3
60141,"Pants quality was satisfactory, size was not.",60141,3
60141,Re ordered and received correct size.,60141,3
60142,If you where a large get a xl,60142,3
60143,I was very disappointed in this purchase.,60143,3
60143,"While the shirt fit ok, a little on the small side, the fabric is just awful.",60143,3
60143,It feels exactly like the cheap polyester from the 70's.,60143,3
60144,Too large.. i think a medium would've been a better fit..,60144,3
60145,I like the lace but I should have listened to the reviews.,60145,3
60145,You want to go a size up when buying this product.,60145,3
60146,"It fits, but it's small, which I expected.",60146,3
60146,"I bought a bra extender, which I 'll try soon.",60146,3
60146,"I can live with it being small, but the push up effect was kind of odd.",60146,3
60146,"I felt like a man in a push up bra, trying to make cleavage where none existed.",60146,3
60146,"And I'm a C or a D cup, so that usually isn't a problem for me.",60146,3
60146,It just gave a weird look.,60146,3
60146,"So, I'm hoping with the extender it will be better.",60146,3
60147,The arms are a little too small and its a little tight,60147,3
60148,"came on time, my wife didn't like the fabric and the size was to big, but thats what you get for shopping for cloths online, the price was good so ill give it a three",60148,3
60149,It was very pretty!,60149,3
60149,However I sent it back.,60149,3
60149,From the reviews I ordered a medium.,60149,3
60149,I am almost the same size as others who ordered a medium.,60149,3
60149,"I don't know if I'm just more self conscious or what, but this was extremely tight!",60149,3
60150,"-fits ok, even though it's sewn for someone without bosom, straigh not even waist contour.",60150,3
60150,"-im not a fan of the knit fabric used, too glossy for my taste, but it's not terrible (especially for $16)",60150,3
60152,Perfect to go under a sweater vest for my daughter.,60152,3
60153,"Very cute, love the colors.",60153,3
60153,I'm a 38C bust and the large was still too small.,60153,3
60153,End up giving it my sister for Christmas and it fits her perfectly.,60153,3
60154,Pretty good for the price,60154,3
60156,Bought the L/XL it's a little big.,60156,3
60156,I have a 7 1/4 to 7 3/8's.,60156,3
60157,Arrived quickly in great shape.,60157,3
60157,"The item is as pictured but a lot thicker than I would have guessed, It sits about (at least) 3 times higher than a normal snap charm.",60157,3
60157,"But I am keeping it, hoping to get used to the look.",60157,3
60157,The timepiece is working..2 days now.,60157,3
60160,Definitely more see-through than see in the photo shown.,60160,3
60160,No rips or holes,60160,3
60161,I'm a little larger trusted and that this did not work for me.,60161,3
60161,There was also not a lot of stretch in the belly area and it up not being able to wear it,60161,3
60162,"It looks great in the yard, however the product came a little damaged.",60162,3
60162,The seat is a thin cardboard and the head is made of Styrofoam so it is definitely made out of cheap materials and I expect it to maybe last another year.,60162,3
60162,"I gave it 3 stars because it still looks ""spooky"" and you can't tell how cheap it is made from afar.",60162,3
60164,But hand wash a must !,60164,3
60164,"I washed and dried it once , now the  sleeves are  unraveling .",60164,3
60164,Also  The undershirt that is connected is very short,60164,3
60165,Based on price alone this was a fair combo pack.,60165,3
60165,"The shirt fabric was as adequate, as expected.",60165,3
60165,The comfort button closure on the neck was a big plus.,60165,3
60165,I should have looked for an athletic or slim fit because the shirt was huge and had to be tailored at least four inches on both side seams (since I was having the pants hemmed it worked out).,60165,3
60165,Next time I will opt to purchase the items separately in an effort to find a higher quality fabrics.,60165,3
60165,I think the cummerbund and tie would have been sharper if they were a higher quality in silk.,60165,3
60165,The studs and cufflinks were as expected.,60165,3
60165,If you plan to make use of the tux more than just on a rare occasion I'd consider thinking of the studs and cufflinks as your jewelry; there were several options available to reflect class and personal style.,60165,3
60166,it's beautiful and gossamer but quite tight on the upper arms and there is no way it can meet in the front unless you're as thin as these models.,60166,3
60166,i thought it could be closed but it hangs wide open.,60166,3
60166,i am going to keep it though because it will look good with a black dress.,60166,3
60167,Great quality just bigger than I expected,60167,3
60168,center clip is awkward.,60168,3
60169,The fit is just ok. You may want to size up.,60169,3
60169,I'm a small and ordered a medium and the sleeves are tight and a little on the short size.,60169,3
60169,Doesn't seem like the best material.,60169,3
60170,Very cute but the sleeves are not long enough for this type of top.,60170,3
60171,You get what you pay for in this case...,60171,3
60172,"3x normally fits me a little loose, but this was a little tight.",60172,3
60173,"Although this is cute and actually good material, it is HUGE.",60173,3
60173,"I am usually a medium bottom and a large top from any regular store, and since it was coming from China, they usually run small.",60173,3
60173,I ordered a large.,60173,3
60173,It's probably comparable to a US XXL.,60173,3
60173,I laughed when I pulled it out of the package.,60173,3
60173,Super bummed because otherwise it's a cute suite.,60173,3
60173,My bottoms were also very large and not a thong bottom like some people were getting.,60173,3
60173,I may try to make the top work somehow by sewing.,60173,3
60174,I bought this white tungsten carbide ring for my boyfriend because we got each other promise rings and he absolutely loves it.,60174,3
60174,he wears it everyday.,60174,3
60174,"This ring is soft, and shiny, he gets compliments.",60174,3
60174,"he never takes it off, it's durable, and doesn't scratch/ i i honestly don't think he's taken it off since i gave it to him for christmas.",60174,3
60174,Definitely worth the money.,60174,3
60174,"it's a nice clean, and smart purchase.",60174,3
60175,I love the shirt but it fits a little small for a women's medium but as far as I can tell didn't shrink in the wash.,60175,3
60176,not as cute as the picture,60176,3
60177,On the small side,60177,3
60179,They are screw off and some are very hard to put in... but other wise very cute.,60179,3
60180,"its well made , but it was super dark blue, more towards navyblack.",60180,3
60180,i thought the color would be like on the picture.,60180,3
60180,also it was pretty smaller than I expected.,60180,3
60181,We bought this bracelet for our teenager that gets bad migraines.,60181,3
60181,"Since she has put it on, she has not had one single migraine until she took it off for a sports practice.",60181,3
60181,I don't know but it is worth the money and a chance.,60181,3
60181,"Only problem is you have to squeeze it to fit a smaller wrist and if you take it off and on, the band will probably break.",60181,3
60181,We did have to replace the first one because two of the magnets fell out.,60181,3
60183,Remember that you get what you pay for.,60183,3
60183,We took a chance.,60183,3
60183,The slit only goes to the knee and was not a clean stitch.,60183,3
60183,I had to fix it myself.,60183,3
60183,The color does not go all the way around as expected.,60183,3
60183,You have a blue strip slightly off centered in the front and a tad on the sides.,60183,3
60183,The majority is just black.,60183,3
60183,The drape adds the color for the back.,60183,3
60183,The Beading is a bit larger than expected.,60183,3
60183,"However, to be honest, I had a feeling it would be.",60183,3
60183,Not a quality material.,60183,3
60183,My daughters prom is in two weeks.,60183,3
60183,"So, it will have to do.",60183,3
60183,She is a sophomore going for a first time.,60183,3
60183,"Well, unless we find something off the rack that will work before then.",60183,3
60183,"Now, like I said, it goes with the price paid.",60183,3
60183,"So, keeping that in mind, it is as it should be, besides the stitching that was a mess on the slit.",60183,3
60184,Should have read the reviews first.,60184,3
60184,I like my clothes a little big and still thought this shirt was huge!!,60184,3
60184,I have ordered a size down and hope I like that better.,60184,3
60185,Love it but it is a little small in the hip area.,60185,3
60186,"They are super cute, but the metal turned dark rather quickly (only a couple of wears) and it stains my skin pretty bad when I wear them.",60186,3
60187,Very cute but run small!,60187,3
60188,"i like the lenth but looks too bulky for my taste, but its really comfortable and warm",60188,3
60189,If you wear a larger size you will have to go into the 2xl.....I ordered an xl and my daughter is a medium and it fit her.....its a cute bathing suit but the size chart is very misleading so now she has another bathing suit to add to her collection.,60189,3
60190,"It's a very pretty shirt, and it's good quality.",60190,3
60190,"But, I ordered a small, and it was absurdly large on me.",60190,3
60191,The fit is a bit off.,60191,3
60191,"The bottom fits like it's supposed to, but the top is a cup too big, I'm a B cup, the top is about a C. If you have C cup boobs and usually wear a medium, order a large and it'll fit you perfectly.",60191,3
60191,"I'm a medium, but I got a large and for the most part it fits.",60191,3
60191,"Also, it got delivered way earlier than what was expected.",60191,3
60191,"I ordered this on June 7th and the expected delivery was between July 1 - July 20, but it's June 17th and it's already here.",60191,3
60192,Never received the clear pouch...,60192,3
60193,Dress was bigger than a size 12,60193,3
60194,"I'm not a small girl but I'm not exactly a big girl either ( size 12-14 us) I ordered an XL,and it's still small ( medium 9-10 in us size) love the pattern and still able to make it work but I won't order again.",60194,3
60195,I love the look!,60195,3
60195,Only downside is that they are so tight around the top that it can be uncomfortable and harder to slip on.,60195,3
60195,Hopefully they'll loosen up a bit.,60195,3
60196,The shirt is pretty and very bright.,60196,3
60196,I weigh 137 lbs.,60196,3
60196,I ordered a large/extra large.,60196,3
60196,It is tighter than my other workout shirts and compresses my bustline.,60196,3
60196,The arm holes are cut high which makes it uncomfortable.,60196,3
60196,"For the price, I will keep it.",60196,3
60196,I will not be buying another though.,60196,3
60198,I really liked the flower on the headband.,60198,3
60199,not what I expected.,60199,3
60199,Much too slinkey for everyday wear.,60199,3
60199,Very nice though .,60199,3
60200,"Pretty dress, but description should list that the dress is tea length.",60200,3
60200,By the picture we thought it was going to be full length.,60200,3
60201,I really like it just wish it was larger.,60201,3
60203,Too big for mom.,60203,3
60204,"Not A1 material, but my son has turned into a jogger/""I wanna be comfy"" type of guy, so good for hanging around home, quick run to Walmart or even to sleep in",60204,3
60207,beautiful gown - runs large,60207,3
60208,XL shrinks to L just like every other damn tshirt out there.,60208,3
60208,"It does offer a slimmer got than others, BUT my the armpits are quite tight (as a 230lbs 6'5"" dude) now that the mid section fits well.",60208,3
60209,not sure if tis the right size,60209,3
60210,Must have been for Juniors - gave it to  my daughter that wears an adult XS - she loves it!,60210,3
60211,I love the way it looks however; I thought it would be thicker..it's very thin and won't keep anyone warm,60211,3
60212,Wasn't crazy about color.,60212,3
60213,I like this shirt.,60213,3
60213,But I am not to sure I like the sleeves.,60213,3
60213,The sleeves are made to look like lace but they look like they would easily fall apart.,60213,3
60213,I haven't washed it yet but this will be a garment that I hang up and not dry for sure to avoid any damage.,60213,3
60214,I have had coach purses in the past.,60214,3
60214,This one seems poor quality.,60214,3
60214,But it wasn't that expensive.,60214,3
60215,This would be great if you were just traveling for a short trip.,60215,3
60215,My son was going for 21 days and his clothes would be very wrinkled if he used this one.,60215,3
60215,And you have to remove all top items to get to bottom ones.,60215,3
60215,We returned this and bought a soft suitcase style bay that you can use backpack straps on it.,60215,3
60215,Was perfect for his needs,60215,3
60216,The middle loop makes no sense.,60216,3
60217,"Ordered Dec 15th received on February 16, 2 months to ship is too long.",60217,3
60217,They look exactly like the picture and are warm.,60217,3
60217,However they are very scratchy inside.,60217,3
60218,The tank top itself fit but the length is too short.,60218,3
60218,The length shrank dramatically.,60218,3
60219,Very pretty More like a dress you would wear to lunch then a beach dress,60219,3
60220,We are only in week 3 of school and the netted part has ripped.,60220,3
60220,The bag itself is sturdy.,60220,3
60221,Unfortunately too small for my already small head.,60221,3
60222,"Comfortable, just a too big for me.",60222,3
60222,"I took XXL based on the reviews,  they are ok fit but I wanted closer fit",60222,3
60224,My wife ordered this.,60224,3
60224,Product was as described but she was a little disappointed because she owns a short sleeve shirt from Roamans and its material is thicker than the long sleeve shirt she received.,60224,3
60224,She thought because it came from Romans the material weight would be the same or heaver.,60224,3
60225,"Good for mild arch support, but not for plantar fascitous.",60225,3
60226,"Love the pattern, and the bottoms are cut perfectly for a new mom.",60226,3
60226,It does run very small though.,60226,3
60226,I can wear a large in Victoria's Secret undies and I have an XXL.,60226,3
60226,The flip side is that my bust isn't quite that big and you have to buy both pieces together.,60226,3
60226,The padding on the top makes your boobs look like you're in a Madonna bra with a high point to them.,60226,3
60226,The back has a funky fastener and isn't adjustable either.,60226,3
60226,I'm trying to find another top to go with the bottoms.,60226,3
60228,"I love these , the only problem is the clasp and chain.",60228,3
60228,"I have to replace them, they break.",60228,3
60229,Thought I had lost my lipstick....... Come to find out one of the outside pockets on gun side is completely open and not sewed.,60229,3
60229,I cannot get to that area to fix it either.,60229,3
60229,I now just have to be aware of what I put in that pocket.,60229,3
60229,"Other than that, I like the soft leather.",60229,3
60230,I love the material and the flow of this shirt.,60230,3
60230,You can buy the XL in the scoop neck or v neck and it looks awesome.,60230,3
60230,This shirt needs to be more fitted to your body.,60230,3
60231,do not get wet it will change color and size fits most fingers,60231,3
60232,Compared to another dress designed the same as this I prefer the other.,60232,3
60232,The pockets on this one kinda stick out permanently making my hips look oddly bigger so I've only worn it once which was mostly around the house.,60232,3
60233,"I went off of China's size chart and it was too large, I would suggest ordering one size smaller.",60233,3
60234,Wished the stone was smaller,60234,3
60235,This bag is super adorable and was exactly what I wanted for EDC.,60235,3
60235,It had a couple of pockets and was easy to adjust.,60235,3
60235,Unfortunately after 3 days of EDC and one more music festival the bag seem ripped apart from the side of the bag.,60235,3
60235,I don't think that I danced that hard but was sad to see that the bag hadn't help up to the rave test for multiple outings.,60235,3
60236,The chain broke once I opened it.,60236,3
60236,It could easily be fixed though.,60236,3
60237,"First off, these are gorgeous and heavy and seemingly very well made.",60237,3
60237,"But, they are not the perfect size for a regular tie.",60237,3
60237,"These would be perfect for a skinny tie, but the clasp is only about an inch long so it won't fit a standard tie.",60237,3
60239,Didn't like it at first but I received a lot of compliments when I finally wore it,60239,3
60240,The slit in the dress is a lot higher then I anticipated it to be.,60240,3
60240,So I will need to re-sew that seam myself.,60240,3
60240,Other then that the dress fits true to size and is perfect for the heat and to cover up my swimsuit!,60240,3
60241,"I'm 5'-6"", 128 pounds, I usually wear small bottoms and xsmall or small tops.",60241,3
60241,I ordered this suit in a medium as many reviews say it ran small.,60241,3
60241,"Ok. Way too small, circumference and height!!",60241,3
60241,And the fabric has very little stretch.,60241,3
60241,There was no squeezing my way into this one.,60241,3
60241,Returning it for a large because it super cute.,60241,3
60242,super cute top but way too small on me.,60242,3
60242,i have a 35 in chest (34d cup size) and there is no way i could wear it,60242,3
60243,The arches are too high for me.,60243,3
60244,I had to buy bra extenders because it was too tight around the chest.,60244,3
60244,"Other than that, the items are well worth the price and absolutely serve the purpose.",60244,3
60245,It's cute but cheaply made .,60245,3
60245,The zipper was stuck .,60245,3
60245,I do like the size of it a lot fits in it .,60245,3
60245,In a rating of 1-5 1 being excellent and 5 garbage I rate it a 3.,60245,3
60246,"look good, and is cheap.",60246,3
60247,It's very tight around the arms and I'm no body builder.,60247,3
60248,"This fits and drapes really well in the shoulders and body, but the sleeves are extremely tight.",60248,3
60248,Hopefully they will stretch and loosen up with wear.,60248,3
60249,Smaller Gauge size might lend to less detail in this product.,60249,3
60250,I got this and its lovely.,60250,3
60250,I ordered based on the size chart provided.,60250,3
60250,However when I recieved there were two spots on it where the material pulled from the boning before I had even put it on.,60250,3
60250,"Something like this doesn't stay on long anyway, but I think a simple couple stitches from a seamstress should fix it.",60250,3
60251,This shirt is more cotton/silky like.,60251,3
60251,"It looks more stiff in the picture, but this shirt is actually pretty flowy and baggy.",60251,3
60251,"Doesn't fit like the picture, either.",60251,3
60251,It will shape more to you than give the boxy look as pictured.,60251,3
60252,"Mesh wasn't as seethrough as the pictures, so lost the effect.",60252,3
60253,Love this since you can adjust the hat to whatever you need,60253,3
60254,The fit is good and they are comfortable to wear!,60254,3
60254,I didn't find them to be see through at all.,60254,3
60254,The material is nice and thick but that makes them a little hot.,60254,3
60254,The belly panel is double layered so they felt a little bulky when I first put them on.,60254,3
60254,After about 10 minutes of jogging I forgot how bulky they felt because my belly was hot.,60254,3
60254,I tried to fold down the panel but that was a little uncomfortable for me at 26 weeks pregnant.,60254,3
60254,These would be perfect winter weight pants but not great for working out in temps over 80.,60254,3
60254,I get hot easily so these are not good for summer time workouts but they are comfy for lounging and errands.,60254,3
60255,"These gloves are so cute, they're probably the most stylish gloves I own.",60255,3
60255,"However they are very difficult to get on, since they're super tight, and they're pretty much impossible to get on if your hands are wet.",60255,3
60255,"The interior is super soft, and the touchscreen capability is spot on.",60255,3
60255,I just wish they were slightly bigger.,60255,3
60256,"Ordered jacket in a medium, my mormal size.",60256,3
60256,I can't button it.,60256,3
60257,"Nice leggings, but pilled up quickly after 1-2 wears.",60257,3
60258,They are cute but don't fit at all.,60258,3
60258,I really can't even get them on my daughter's feet and I ordered her correct size 8.,60258,3
60258,I'll be returning these.,60258,3
60259,I'm not convinced this is real leather.,60259,3
60259,"It's okay, but looks kind of cheap.",60259,3
60259,It did come WAY faster than expected which was a wonderful surprise!,60259,3
60260,Its soft and pretty color but doesnt fit as expected and I ordered a bigger size than I usually wear,60260,3
60262,The shorts are very cute and appear to be well made except for the buttons.,60262,3
60262,The shorts have a flex fit which you can adjust but first time wearing them when I tried to adjust the waist the buttons on both sides broke!,60262,3
60262,We have seen this with some of the volcom shorts as well where the buttons are not sewn on tight.,60262,3
60262,To have them both break right out of the box is a first for us.,60262,3
60262,"I had to do some sewing (which I am horrible at) so they work to a point now but, I was not very happy with the shorts craftsmanship right out of the box.",60262,3
60263,"My wife loved them, but hated that they take so long to ship.",60263,3
60263,Plus she was dissapointed that they are smaller than pictured.,60263,3
60263,But the quality is good for inexpensive jewlery... Go figure.,60263,3
60264,Too big in the chest area!,60264,3
60265,It is not a quality item by any means.,60265,3
60265,I would not purchase it again.,60265,3
60266,The length of the socks were a bit shorter than described but they were semi durable for a couple uses but developed holes quickly .,60266,3
60267,"Runs super small, I wear a large so I ordered up 2 sizes to an XXL as many people suggested - got it over my head but my boobs were smushed and it basically fit like a sausage casing.",60267,3
60267,"If you're tiny, buy it, it's very pretty and the material seems decent.",60267,3
60269,"Too bulky, my son wasn't comfortable wearing them.",60269,3
60269,Theyre cute but not wearable,60269,3
60270,Too tight on baby's wrist .,60270,3
60270,My son is 2 months old and these mittens do not fit his wrists.,60270,3
60270,"And, I would not buy them for a boy, too girlish!",60270,3
60271,I love that they are all cotton and they are exactly what I wanted but the other reviews were right when you wash them even in cold water the legs and arms shrink considerably.,60271,3
60271,Would be nice if it had been preshrunk.,60271,3
60271,If I had paid $49 for them I would have been irate and sent them back.,60271,3
60271,But I did buy two more pair and am hoping they will be better they are all one color.,60271,3
60271,That is to be seen.,60271,3
60272,I'm feeling a little deflated over this beanie.,60272,3
60272,"It fits perfectly, it's well constructed, it does it's job perfectly.",60272,3
60272,"However, the blue is not vibrant and bright as pictured.",60272,3
60272,"It's more of a dusty blue, soft and muted.",60272,3
60272,"The ombre effect is pretty, but it'd be prettier if it were as colorful as depicted.",60272,3
60273,The swimsuit is okay but a bit thin.,60273,3
60273,If you want to get one or two wears out of it well then it's a good buy but long term no,60273,3
60274,Loosens up very easily then comes of.,60274,3
60274,Wish it fit better.,60274,3
60275,This is not what I am looking for in a top but will wear it as a swim cover up.,60275,3
60275,It feels like a cotton sheet.,60275,3
60276,The red and green stones are not as pretty as I hoped they'd be.,60276,3
60276,Overall I did not like the way they looked for the money.,60276,3
60276,I'd pay $5-10 for these not $15.,60276,3
60277,Flairs just below hips a lot more than the picture shows.,60277,3
60277,Makes my hips look wider than I would like.,60277,3
60277,Soft material but it is thin.,60277,3
60278,Fits just right but has strong smell.,60278,3
60278,"After it was washed, it was just fine.",60278,3
60279,BUYER BEWARE - what you see is NOT what you get.,60279,3
60279,We purposely purchased this watch for the image of wonder woman but also for the NUMBERS clock display.,60279,3
60279,The numbers you see on the image look like they're photoshopped.,60279,3
60279,The watch we got has no clock display.,60279,3
60279,"after many attempts the seller finally says,""because we think this design will be enough for customers to read time .""",60279,3
60279,"The watch took about 1.5 months to be delivered, and the end result was that the watch was teach our kid to tell time with her favorite superhero, that's out the window now.",60279,3
60279,"We're only giving the watch 3 stars because the watch is actually nice, just wish it had the numbers on it as advertised.",60279,3
60280,I'm 5'6 and 150 lbs and I ordered a Medium.,60280,3
60280,"I was so excited to wear it, but it does NOT come down past the knee like the pictures show.",60280,3
60280,It came up about mid thigh!,60280,3
60280,"It was also a little snug in the shoulders, but still a cute dress.",60280,3
60281,"Product is ok, but doesn't fit",60281,3
60282,"I usually LOVE Allegra K Items, but this one was lacking a bit.",60282,3
60282,"It is cute, but fit tighter than usual (I always order an XS) and it is also shorter than expected.",60282,3
60282,"I am 5'4"" and it hit mid-thigh, so I can't wear this to work at all.",60282,3
60282,"Also, the fabric is super thin and flimsy.",60282,3
60282,"I will get a couple good wears out of it, but other than that it isn't going to be as versatile as I had hoped.",60282,3
60282,But a cure dress to wear with black tights and have a cute 90s look with.,60282,3
60282,Looks great with a red cardigan.,60282,3
60283,"fringe is gorgeous, but the 'kimono' fabric is cheap.",60283,3
60284,Very nice bag but it's really small didn't expect it to be that tiny.,60284,3
60286,Too small for clear details.,60286,3
60287,I loved the feel of the material but it was way to small.,60287,3
60287,I ordered an xl and it fit like a small.,60287,3
60287,I register it to someone who was actually a small,60287,3
60288,It took a bit to figure out how to wear this.,60288,3
60288,They should send a manual lol.,60288,3
60288,Other then that it is a bit bigger then I'd like and I have a large top.,60288,3
60289,cheap but I will get my moneys worth.,60289,3
60290,Cute necklace but probably won't last more than 6 months due to the fact that it's cheaply made and the gold on the necklace will tarnish quickly.,60290,3
60290,For the price it's a great disposable necklace.,60290,3
60291,Missing a piece on the purse.,60291,3
60292,There isn't enough structure there was a lot of bending,60292,3
60293,Just a little too big.,60293,3
60294,Nice shirt other that it being a little to big its fine.,60294,3
60295,I didn't like this because it was thicker than usual and I didn't like the cheap feeling... nice dress though,60295,3
60296,Not the best quality.,60296,3
60297,Sizing off however will keep hoping to loose weight,60297,3
60298,"Okay, these are hands-down adorable shoes.",60298,3
60298,I love how they look on my feet.,60298,3
60298,"HOWEVER, I don't know how many times I tripped in them, and I am used to wearing high heals for the majority of the week, all day.",60298,3
60298,"I need to add abrasive stripes on the bottoms for traction, too.",60298,3
60298,"And, the right shoe straps were too big for my foot, while the left was fine.",60298,3
60298,Never had that problem with shoes before.,60298,3
60298,I also had to put a few more holes in the straps to make them tighter.,60298,3
60298,"So much potential, but the little things make them not my favorite pair.",60298,3
60299,Rolls up more than I expected.,60299,3
60299,So any movement moves the band.,60299,3
60299,Feels good just moves too much,60299,3
60301,I weigh around 160 and I had a baby in August.,60301,3
60301,So I ordered a medium but I should of got the large.,60301,3
60301,"I still have a little tummy from my pregnancy, it makes it difficult to close.",60301,3
60301,I still wear the medium but it is super thigh,60301,3
60302,"It will fit My Grandaughter..Slightly  Disappointment, She will love it..Sizes were Child sizes..I thought They would be bigger..",60302,3
60303,"pretty dress, flattering, even during pregnancy...only wish it was thicker--I have to wear something under it because it is a bit see through and the different ways you can wear the straps is detracted from by having to layer another shirt/bra underneath",60303,3
60304,I was expecting a full side pocket for concealed carry.,60304,3
60304,The actual purse only has a small pocket under the zipper.,60304,3
60305,"The rings aren't closed all the way, so the straps fall off a lot.",60305,3
60305,The zipper is also breaking.,60305,3
60306,cute dress but too short for the size.,60306,3
60306,the flowers on shoulder lokked brittle,60306,3
60307,"Top fit nicely, bottoms seem slightly small",60307,3
60308,Did not receive the panties that were pictured.,60308,3
60308,Got a whole different set of colors and style.,60308,3
60308,But I do like the them.,60308,3
60308,Gives great coverage and the softness is nice feel.,60308,3
60309,It's cute but the material is a bit clingy so unless you have nothing to hide I would size up or stay away.,60309,3
60310,"It was a good dress,  but it could have loosed different.",60310,3
60311,Looks different than the picture .,60311,3
60311,The tutu is already coming part no to mention it's again different than the picture .,60311,3
60312,The material is way too thin and transparent.,60312,3
60313,"Don't write great and suck being sharpen, works best as a gag gift.",60313,3
60314,"Bought for a friend, broke within the first night of going out, I think it's the pewter because I have another Alchemy bag that did the same thing after a few months.",60314,3
60314,my friend is going to repair it herself.,60314,3
60314,But instead of almost 200$ I feel it should have been $130.,60314,3
60314,"I have had all the same issues with every Alchemy Gothic bag I have gotten, the pewter straps/connectors break.",60314,3
60314,"3 stars for leather workmanship and 2 stars for pewter and connections that are not function-able (This is the 3rd Alchemy Gothic Bag I have gotten, two a different style, and the other is this one).",60314,3
60315,The lines that are sewn are not proportional.,60315,3
60316,* Jumpsuit arrived with the logo deeply wrinkled and crushed.,60316,3
60316,"* Would have returned, but I bought it for a friend's birthday the next day.",60316,3
60316,"I turned suit inside out, spent a half hour trying to iron logo out as smooth as possible with moderate success.",60316,3
60316,"* XXL was still too small in height for my friend when he tried it on, so he gave to his wife (Superwoman).",60316,3
60316,"*Otherwise, this was cute and comfy,  medium weight fabric, cozy fleece",60316,3
60317,Very pretty gift for my granddaughter.,60317,3
60317,It is costume jewelry.,60317,3
60318,Really bright red color.,60318,3
60318,Didn't work for what we were going to use it for (Starlord costume) but it was too much of a hassle to send it back.,60318,3
60318,"Not great quality
Would be good for a costume, but not every day wear.",60318,3
60319,It's more a sleeve than a bag.,60319,3
60319,Looks better in pic.,60319,3
60320,Back seam had to be stitched up.,60320,3
60320,A lot of loose threads but slippers do stay on heels better than other slippers I had.,60320,3
60321,"This romper is super cute and very well made, but it was way too big for my daughter.",60321,3
60321,I got the size 18-24 months but this would fit her when she's 3 at least.,60321,3
60321,She still hasn't been able to use it after 8 months of being purchased.,60321,3
60322,This was exactly as photographed however it is a heavy piece of jewelry..,60322,3
60322,"Very pretty and like that the flower is free flowing inside, the chain is pretty that comes with it, but it would be better as a key chain maybe rather then necklace just due to weight of the piece",60322,3
60323,"Top fits a little large, bottoms really small!",60323,3
60323,I typically wear a large bottom ordered an XL it looked like a small.,60323,3
60324,"fits great , just not comfortable",60324,3
60325,I have the same size in other Stetson hats which fit more snug.,60325,3
60326,this is so cute and fits great.,60326,3
60326,"however, the quality is very cheap.",60326,3
60326,the shoulder bows are held in place with a tiny bit of fabric glue and they fell off the first time my daughter wore this outfit.,60326,3
60327,A little bit small and very thin material.,60327,3
60328,Does not actually hang off the shoulder..,60328,3
60329,Definitely for casual wear.,60329,3
60329,"Look nice, but of less quality of other Megia watches I've purchased.",60329,3
60330,But sizes were short for two items.,60330,3
60330,Hence two stars less.,60330,3
60330,Lucky if you get all five with correct sizes.,60330,3
60331,"I'm not skinny, but on the slender side.",60331,3
60331,This is very boxy and bulky.,60331,3
60331,I might use it as outer wear.,60331,3
60331,This model pictured must have it clipped in the back for the photo?,60331,3
60331,VERY soft and luxurious feel!,60331,3
60332,They bottom fit perfect the top is too small.,60332,3
60332,I have to give it to my sister  and even her that shes not busty found the top a bit small,60332,3
60333,A tad thinner than I would like but they are okay?,60333,3
60334,"Fits good but little more ""orangey"" than I expected.",60334,3
60334,Great top to wear around Halloween or Thanksgiving.,60334,3
60335,"Fits big, but it is a nice color.",60335,3
60335,I gave it 3 stars because it fits a little big on me and the material is not breathable,60335,3
60336,It's comfortable and the shoulders are broad enough to always cover bra straps.,60336,3
60336,"I'd call the fit 'relaxed' because it's not like the picture at the waist, but the looseness is comfortable in the heat, though not very flattering.",60336,3
60336,"It's a light weight knit, similar to tee-shirts.",60336,3
60336,The print is pretty and great camouflage if you have little ones.,60336,3
60337,Good quality fabric and workmanship.,60337,3
60337,Seems to run small.,60337,3
60338,"The band is very cheap quality, it was cracking already when wearing it for the first time.",60338,3
60338,You will definitely need to replace the band yourself.,60338,3
60338,The face itself is nice.,60338,3
60339,Did not come with a hanky....:-(,60339,3
60340,It is an odd shiny fabric that reminds me of the 90s.,60340,3
60340,I still like it but it's kinda odd.,60340,3
60340,"Very thick so good for winter, not good for summer.",60340,3
60341,These are definitely not made to last.,60341,3
60341,Heel started separating from body of shoe after some wear.,60341,3
60342,To small sent back,60342,3
60343,Not tight but not as loose as I expected.,60343,3
60343,"Pockets fixed, you sit you spill change, sewn into the outer layer.",60343,3
60344,Got wrong size and I couldn't order a different one... order system has a bug.,60344,3
60346,The small size is way too small.,60346,3
60346,I need to return the small and get a medium.,60346,3
60346,However the dress is sooo cute and seems to be well made.,60346,3
60346,Very soft and kind of see thru.,60346,3
60346,So I will be looking to get a slip to wear under.,60346,3
60346,It's definetely see thru even with white bra and panties.,60346,3
60346,Don't forget that when you raise your arms the dress gets shorter and could possibly flash your bits!,60346,3
60347,But the stripes don't line up.,60347,3
60348,I thought the material would have been knitted,60348,3
60349,"The colors are bright as shown in the picture but I'm a little surprised at the ratings, the bracelet is very small.",60349,3
60349,It's more of a cuff style bracelet than a wrap.,60349,3
60349,I would suggest for a 6 inch wrist or smaller.,60349,3
60351,"The bottoms almost fit true to size, but the top is way too big.",60351,3
60351,"I think the top might even fit me, and I'm not a small chested person!",60351,3
60351,I'd recommend buying a size smaller and knowing how to sew so you can take the top in.,60351,3
60351,The material is also very thin on the top.,60351,3
60352,Not high quality but cute.,60352,3
60352,1 of three broken the second I put it on.,60352,3
60353,Over all was great looking but the fit was a little big around legs,60353,3
60354,Way smaller than I expected especially for the price,60354,3
60355,Not a good material & sleeves & pockets sewed on crooked.,60355,3
60355,Huge & clingy material.,60355,3
60355,I wear as a sleep shirt,60355,3
60359,small but I love it,60359,3
60360,This is a mildly attractive bracelet with cheap beads.,60360,3
60360,It looks pretty good with casual clothes.,60360,3
60360,"The wooden beads are small, light, and not as lustrous as I expected in the photo.",60360,3
60360,They do have a light varnish for shine.,60360,3
60360,"The beads probably cost a dollar, including the silver-tone ones.",60360,3
60360,"The leather strap has 3 snaps -- if you want to use any snap other an the one on the end, you'll probably want to cut off the excess as it dangles unattractively, albeit cuuting it limits the length flexibility for a necklace.",60360,3
60360,"Even at its tightest, the bracelet was loose and the silver beads -- which sadly do not extend completely around my wrist -- rotate to the inside wrist and are not easily visible.",60360,3
60360,This should cost around $5 but it is overpriced at $11.,60360,3
60360,And I didn't receive the free gift bag.,60360,3
60361,The colors aren't nearly as vibrant as they appear in the photo.,60361,3
60362,This fit a little snug and it also rose on my hips.,60362,3
60363,I like the material of the sweater.,60363,3
60363,It is a little smaller in the waist area then anticipated.,60363,3
60363,It is also a little see through.,60363,3
60366,The quality of the product his not that well call the PD I think leather is pleather printing I thought it was going to be stitched in letters overall 2 to 3 Stars.,60366,3
60368,"The stated size was way too small,but I still love the styling of this shirt!",60368,3
60369,"Cute, simple but not the best quality",60369,3
60370,I really like this watch and I think it's beautifully made.,60370,3
60370,"However, the ""time"" feathers are confusing to me as there is an extra feather.",60370,3
60370,Probably I'm just being dumb about how to read the time on the watch but I can only use it as a pretty bracelet.,60370,3
60370,"If someone asks me the time, I really haven't got a clue.",60370,3
60371,Says adult size but the fit is too small.,60371,3
60372,But it frayed and broke within a week of buying it,60372,3
60373,I love this purse.,60373,3
60373,I love the design and the color.,60373,3
60373,The outer zipper didn't hold up under pressure.,60373,3
60373,After owning this purse for a couple months the zipper broke and I had to quit using the purse.,60373,3
60373,I was disappointed because I loved it so much!,60373,3
60374,"Great fit, comfortable shirt, but the image is completely cracked and faded in spots after the first wash. Only about 50% of the image still remains.",60374,3
60374,So it'll be an all gray shirt soon.,60374,3
60375,I read all the reviews and it warned me it ran small so I ordered a size up...wish I would have ordered 2 sizes...I will squeeze into it though with the help of some spanks.,60375,3
60375,The dress is made quite well has an inner liner.,60375,3
60375,"Zipper is a little hard to maneuver, but I will only wear this a time or two so that shouldn't be a real issue.",60375,3
60376,I don't like the quality of the metal.,60376,3
60376,It also scratches my skin when pulling it on or off.,60376,3
60376,I gave it 3 stars because it would be good for a teen or someone who doesn't need/care about wearing a higher quality metal.,60376,3
60378,"I love the look of this suit, but I am about as small as they come and only 4'10"" yet it is to short in the torso",60378,3
60379,"This hoodie was smaller than we expected, and Snoopy is not centered in the front.",60379,3
60379,The image is also smaller than we expected.,60379,3
60379,"His image is cute enough, just like in the picture.",60379,3
60379,"The material is of medium weight, so not particularly warm but considerably heavier than a regular long sleeved shirt.",60379,3
60379,"Based on the cost, I probably would wait to buy it until it was discounted.",60379,3
60380,Way too small.....I usually wear a size medium and thought a large would fit....wrong!,60380,3
60381,It's fits like a glove and it would be great when it starts to get cool outside again because on the inside it has some type of warmth fabric.,60381,3
60382,"was a xl for me, but was tight across the sisters..",60382,3
60383,"It took a few days to get used to wearing this, but now I put it on almost every day under my workout gear.",60383,3
60384,Too long for my short legs!!,60384,3
60384,Must have them rehemed,60384,3
60385,"I love the sunglasses, but the arm broke off the day after the return policy ended.",60385,3
60385,"I really like how they look on my face, though.",60385,3
60385,"7/10 quality isn't great, but would buy again.",60385,3
60386,If only they had x small in this it would be amazing !,60386,3
60386,The bottom fit but not tight enough little loose.,60386,3
60386,my boobs are kind of big 34c the top is too small to cover wish the strap around the top was attached to it !,60386,3
60386,Over all it's a cute outfit.,60386,3
60387,Makes me look like a box but nice quality.,60387,3
60387,Meant for people with tinier waist,60387,3
60388,came as dark blue instead of black,60388,3
60389,Dress came as pictured and is made with a thick frabric that's good for fall and winter.,60389,3
60389,I'm 5'4 135 pounds and ordered a size medium.,60389,3
60389,I only have three starts because it was too long for how I planned to wear it.,60389,3
60389,I just have to change my game plan.,60389,3
60390,The coats quality is excellent.,60390,3
60390,I haven't any claims about it.,60390,3
60390,I ordered M size.,60390,3
60390,My up size is 10 and down size is 12.,60390,3
60390,"But M size on me looks like L. I have D cup of bra,means my breasts are not so small but in the coat I felt like I have A size cos of too much space inside around the chest... Looks like for E or eve F cup size...",60390,3
60390,So M size is running big as for me.,60390,3
60391,The brim is quite flimsy but I like the coverage and it doesn't seem to bother my kid.,60391,3
60392,All the buttons came off while wearing it for the first time for my daughter and i,60392,3
60393,Will look very sexy once wife loses a few pounds but fits small!!,60393,3
60395,Pretty but a tad small,60395,3
60396,I wasn't really expecting too much for the price so I can't really be too disappointed with this dress.,60396,3
60396,It is just something to wear around the house on a hot day.,60396,3
60396,Wish it had more blue in it than black and red.,60396,3
60396,The fabric has a stinky smell  right out of the bag so plan on washing it right away.,60396,3
60397,The mask it very pretty but not what I was looking for.,60397,3
60397,This fits around your face and ties in the back.,60397,3
60397,The ribbon tie is short and does't leave much room for the knot.,60397,3
60397,The eye holes are not large enough for my liking.,60397,3
60397,It is very pretty though.,60397,3
60398,"fits big, very baggy, looks like the photo",60398,3
60399,I gave them 3 stars only because the metal is cheap and not heavy as I expected it and some of the pearls have damaged surface.,60399,3
60399,The metal has a rose orange gold color not a yellow color like real gold.,60399,3
60399,The flowers are nicely executed and overall it has a nice look.,60399,3
60400,"size was correct, but after the first wash (inside out) the image was faded.",60400,3
60400,seems like it wasn't heat sealed before being sent out.,60400,3
60401,"it's pretty, the only reason, I gave it a 3 stars, because this is definitely not for women, but for little girls 6-7 years old",60401,3
60402,"I ordered one of these in a dif style size Large ....fit perfectly so I decided to order another one same size , I don't know if I received the wrong size but this one does not fit ...can't wear it as its too small .",60402,3
60403,Cute top but the grey is much lighter than pictured and the tassel are wide cuts of fabric.,60403,3
60403,I was expecting them to be more string-like.,60403,3
60404,Moderately comfy but baggy and shapeless.,60404,3
60405,The waistband was too small so it fit snug above the hips and the flare of the skirt didn't work for it to sit up so high for me.,60405,3
60406,smaller than normal for the size-my advice is order 1 size larger than you would normally,60406,3
60407,My first pair lasted 6 mos.,60407,3
60407,then broke where the rubber ear pads connect to the ear piece.,60407,3
60407,Bought three more pairs and all of them broke in the same place.,60407,3
60407,I love the color and visual clarity but can't justify buying any more.,60407,3
60407,I do like them but they just don't last.,60407,3
60408,My grandson likes the hat and thinks it's fun.,60408,3
60408,"Because it is an animal head, and therefore more likely to worn by young children,  I would have hoped it was a bit smaller with a tad shorter 'paws'.",60408,3
60408,It is not an outdoor hat as it will not keep anyone warm - but it's fun.,60408,3
60408,It's a novelty only.,60408,3
60409,It was so cute but I could've ordered the next size up.,60409,3
60409,The pads move around so it would've been nice if they could be removed.,60409,3
60409,"Unfortunately, I washed it before wearing as suggested in the instructions on Amazon (none came in the package) and the black faded the cute white dots and the tie.",60409,3
60410,"I'm actually surprised it does look like the picture, this jumpsuit definitely runs small I wear a medium some larges so I ordered a large and I need just a little more room.",60410,3
60410,Would be perfect if the material stretched.,60410,3
60410,A little awkward with the hood and the zipper in the back had a tough time getting the top over my head otherwise not high quality but still a nice style,60410,3
60411,Followed the guidelines but ended up being larger than expected .,60411,3
60411,The actual material is shiny black and sleeves are too loose at end.,60411,3
60411,There is a big seem going through the middle if the back that isn't my style.,60411,3
60411,I will donate shirt mostly because the material is not what I expected,60411,3
60412,These are more padded than we expected.,60412,3
60412,"Buyer BEWARE, if you need to return they have to be shipped back to CHINA and it costs more than the price of the product!",60412,3
60413,The color is more of a sky or very light blue.,60413,3
60413,It's not true to the picture.,60413,3
60414,"It's VERY small, but ended up being perfect for a beading project.",60414,3
60414,"The color is very dark, but it is indeed amethyst.",60414,3
60414,Arrived a month early.,60414,3
60415,Super cute but very small.,60415,3
60416,"to small didn't fit always around and I have a  normal size neck , but it was very cute item , but cant use it I have to give it as a gift for a child",60416,3
60417,The material is a little cheap.,60417,3
60417,I guess you get what you pay for,60417,3
60418,Somewhat smaller than the size I requested,60418,3
60420,"Comfy material but ran smaller than expected, I gave it to a friend but I intend on ordering this again in a larger size :)",60420,3
60421,Ordered medium fits a big C small D cheap quality but looks good and is compfy,60421,3
60423,Brim isn't quite as wide as I'd hoped it would be.,60423,3
60424,"This item is small, my child is 19 months and average weight and height.",60424,3
60424,I ordered size 3T and after arrival washed it and it fits just tight.,60424,3
60424,Make sure to go up in size!,60424,3
60425,Love it but the 6 month size fit way too small on my baby and she's 2 months old lol.,60425,3
60425,She's 12lbs and 23 inches.,60425,3
60426,"This is a nice product, however the sizing is extremely off.",60426,3
60426,Previous reviews said it ran small so I ordered a larger size.,60426,3
60426,I normally wear a medium but got an XL and it fits more like a t shirt than a dress.,60426,3
60427,I gave the set 3 stars because the colors are a little off.,60427,3
60427,It looks pink in the picture but it's not as dark.,60427,3
60427,The necklace is about 9 inches long and earrings about 2 inches in length.,60427,3
60427,It's a little heavy.,60427,3
60428,Too small by a long shot.,60428,3
60428,I am a small C so I ordered a C and it was way too small.,60428,3
60428,"The adhesive was acceptable, but the edges were quick to come off constantly.",60428,3
60428,I definitely wouldn't wear it if I thought I was going to sweat much at all.,60428,3
60428,"On the plus side, I wore it for 12 hours and although it started to itch pretty bad in the last few hours, it definitely stayed in place.",60428,3
60431,"The intended audience for these enjoyed them, but I can't wear them comfortably on a regular basis.",60431,3
60432,"ordered medium, fits more like a large.",60432,3
60432,"Also is cut longer in the back, than in the front.",60432,3
60433,"Runs a bit large, but overall nice fit.",60433,3
60433,Just watch out for gusts of wind as dress flys up easily.,60433,3
60433,"Only thing, and this is sort of a deal breaker, it's hand wash only.",60433,3
60433,For a $15 dress that seems absurd.,60433,3
60433,Makes wearing it a hassle.,60433,3
60434,I am little unsure of the quality and authenticity.,60434,3
60434,I was first surprised to find them to be a metal matte finish which I didn't know RayBan made in these aviators.,60434,3
60434,I assumed they would be the normal shiny metal finish.,60434,3
60434,"Then, one of the arms is super tight, so opening and closing them for wear is pretty difficult.",60434,3
60434,"I thought it would have loosened up after a few wears, but I still have to force the arm open, but with care not to bend or break them.",60434,3
60434,I'm a little dissapointed in the quality.,60434,3
60435,Legs are too tight and it's hard to snap on a wiggly toddler.,60435,3
60435,Going to order snap less next time and size larger.,60435,3
60437,It is affordable and that is important,60437,3
60438,Liked it but I ordered bigger cause of the reviews still fit a bit snug and was short,60438,3
60439,"I like the color, etc.",60439,3
60439,But it is too small.,60439,3
60440,I dislike the fact I have to wear it upside down for the lighter not to fall out.,60440,3
60441,This visor had the potential to be perfect.,60441,3
60441,I found the fit to be really good and comfortable.,60441,3
60441,The band was not too tight as some other users had experienced (though I do have a small head so that may have helped).,60441,3
60441,The visor part itself is a good size and shape and the angle is adjustable so it really does protect your whole face which is exactly what I was looking for.,60441,3
60441,Unfortunately as other members have mentioned it doesn't seem to do very well in high temperatures and mine has also started to melt.,60441,3
60441,It has become misshapen in parts where the sun has been too strong for it.,60441,3
60441,This doesn't stop it from working and doing its job but it does now make me look like a reject from a Daft Punk video when I'm wearing it.,60441,3
60441,I would have thought that a product designed to protect your face from the sun would have the ability to stand up to the temperatures expected when sun bathing.,60441,3
60442,"I ordered a large and the dress fits like a medium, beautiful dress runs small",60442,3
60443,My baby is 9 months old and I have ordered these sleepers in 12-month size.,60443,3
60443,Too tight to wear.,60443,3
60444,I ordered a 2 larger sizes based and all reviews BUT DONT.,60444,3
60444,It does not run small.,60444,3
60444,At least not that small.,60444,3
60444,Maybe 1 size up.,60444,3
60444,I normally wear ML and got the xxl it looks way too loose.,60444,3
60444,Unfortunerly now checking they do not have L,60444,3
60445,The dress was too small,60445,3
60446,"Great concept for a necklace but, within about 5 times of wearing the item it started to tarnish.",60446,3
60446,"The ""silver"" coating is now rubbing off wherever it's touched my skin and the chain is as well.",60446,3
60446,Making the necklace look dirty.,60446,3
60446,I would pay extra to have a better material used that won't fade or tarnish.,60446,3
60446,It's ok but a little disappointing.,60446,3
60448,The fabric is very comfortable.,60448,3
60448,Need a lean figure to carry this style.,60448,3
60449,"The design is cute, but the fabric is thin and not high quality.",60449,3
60450,"Fits great, true to size.",60450,3
60450,The wine color is alot more of a bright red then it looks in the picture.,60450,3
60450,It's still nice I was just looking forward to the deep wine red that is pictured.,60450,3
60451,A bit flimsier than I was hoping.,60451,3
60451,"I bought this for a Mad Men costume, and it worked for it, but the material is more stretchy and soft than the crisp 50s look I was expecting.",60451,3
60452,Gave the dress to a friend because it fitted me kind of tight.,60452,3
60453,"I gave this as a gift to my youngest daughter--who has not commented on it--so I am unable to provide an adequate Review of this item/product, at this Time!",60453,3
60454,Unfortunately it doesn't fit in the breast area and that makes me very sad because I love how it looks.,60454,3
60455,Torn between somewhat large and somewhat small.,60455,3
60455,Legs are very long and waist is pretty tight.,60455,3
60455,My daughter is a very tall 2  90th percentile for height but 65th for weight so she's a pretty slender kid.,60455,3
60455,She's got long legs but these bunch down at the ankles and they leave an imprint on her waist.,60455,3
60455,Unfortunately not many options for ballet tights for the toddler set.,60455,3
60456,way too big  at least the baby can grow into it,60456,3
60457,Decent belt for the money,60457,3
60458,"Its a cute suit, but the top was much, much too small for me.",60458,3
60458,The bottoms fit me fine.,60458,3
60458,"I wound up giving it to a smaller chested friend who found the top fit good, but the bottoms were big on her.",60458,3
60458,She liked the top because it fits securely and she likes to swim in the ocean.,60458,3
60458,She's probably 125 lbs and an A or B cup and maybe a size 4 in pants.,60458,3
60458,"I'm 130 lbs, a 34D, and wear size 6 in pants.",60458,3
60458,I have a hard time finding bikinis that fit me.,60458,3
60458,I prefer a L top and a S bottom.,60458,3
60458,"Originally, I thought the suit was cheap enough I would buy two different sizes so both the top and bottoms would fit well, but I thought the suit design was a little odd in that it left a lot of side boob exposed.",60458,3
60458,There just isn't enough fabric on the side for me.,60458,3
60458,The colors are very vibrant.,60458,3
60458,I like the color much better in the picture than in real life.,60458,3
60459,material is cheap and it's very short.,60459,3
60459,"fit well around the rest of my body but i'm 5""3 got an XL didn't think it would still be short but it was.",60459,3
60460,This thing looks cooler online that it does in person.,60460,3
60460,It's fine in person but it's the size that doesn't look good--it's gigantic!,60460,3
60460,I ended up returning it bc the round part is just too huge and looked odd.,60460,3
60460,"I love the design, the color metal, etc.. but double check the diameter of the actual circle to make sure you want something that large--it made it look cheap.",60460,3
60463,very short I am 5'7,60463,3
60464,Super cute though it is small and kind of rides up as you wear it.,60464,3
60464,Bummed didn't know it was so short.,60464,3
60464,I'm 5'9 it literally stops at the bottom of my butt.,60464,3
60465,This bracelet only looks good if your hand is down just like in the description photo.,60465,3
60465,If you're talking and moving your hands it looks tangled.,60465,3
60466,These are definitely NOT compression.,60466,3
60466,They're a looser fit.,60466,3
60466,Not what I was looking for but I like the material & they'll still work so I'm keeping them.,60466,3
60466,"Was just expecting a tighter, fit.",60466,3
60466,"I thought that's what ""compression"" meant.",60466,3
60467,"Made by India, hmmmmm quality not bad, but after washing 2-3 times I feel I will throw it to garbage",60467,3
60468,"Beautiful purple dress, just to darn small.",60468,3
60468,"The dress runs small, needs to come in a 3X",60468,3
60469,"Too large, I'm sending bac .",60469,3
60470,This necklace is beautiful and so versatile.,60470,3
60470,"However, be ready to strengthen the muscles in your neck as it is heavy.",60470,3
60470,The only drawback is the back of it can pill certain fabrics.,60470,3
60471,I wanted a simple skirt with plenty of leg room.,60471,3
60471,This skirt looked very stylish online so I bought the purple plaid one.,60471,3
60471,I ordered one in a small even though I saw people saying they run ridiculously small.,60471,3
60471,"They ended up sending me a Medium, which was good because I just fit into it.",60471,3
60471,I could have even gotten a bigger size than that since it sits a little higher on my waist than I like.,60471,3
60471,"The skirt is lined, but not part where the belt loops are, so it is very itchy being wool.",60471,3
60471,"Pros: Not see-through, good fabric, plenty of leg room
Cons: Itchy on waist, runs small even on next size up, a little too short",60471,3
60472,Broke first time I wore it,60472,3
60473,The reviews that mentioned how the suit fit were very helpful as it does run small.,60473,3
60473,I wasn't aware that the underpart would be like shorts.,60473,3
60473,I would have preferred a regular bathing suit type but I will give it a try.,60473,3
60477,I bought this sandal with the  Orthaheel  tetechnology because of my plantar fasciitis.,60477,3
60477,"Initially, the sandals felt great.",60477,3
60477,"As the day wore on, they felt like any other shoe  and aggravated my plantar fasciitis.",60477,3
60478,I don't feel they are better than other inserts for the same price.,60478,3
60479,"It looks okay in real life, very sturdy and can hold a lot of heavy stuff in it for work!",60479,3
60481,this item is very comfortable i put it on right away over an underwear of course.,60481,3
60481,"this item could use a bit more compression around the lower abdomen, i think based on the chart i ordered the xl.",60481,3
60481,"will reorder in medium next time i order , for more compression on lower ab",60481,3
60482,"The fabric was a little thin, and it was much smaller than it appears in the pictures.",60482,3
60483,The review that the strap comes off are oh so true.,60483,3
60483,Other than that I did like this wallet and the size is handy if you don't need the strap.,60483,3
60484,I usually wear a large but knowing kimonos I bought the medium.,60484,3
60484,It's fits just right.,60484,3
60484,Great colors and I like the length.,60484,3
60485,"It's beautiful,and I do like,that it has large brims,but it fits too large!!!!!!!!",60485,3
60486,Watch face is nice but band is very cheaply made.,60486,3
60486,Not shocked by this due to the price.,60486,3
60487,Ehhhhhhhhhh it's okay I guess doesn't fit like I think it should ha,60487,3
60488,"I must admit, I'm a bit disappointed in these.",60488,3
60488,I bought them with the idea that they'd be nice bold colors like the picture but sadly they are not.,60488,3
60488,"The black and white ones are solid however all the others are pretty transparent so they don't stand out as well as I'd hoped, especially the teal.",60488,3
60488,If you're buying these for the teal ones (that was the color I was most excited for) I'd suggest a different set because you'll probably be disappointed.,60488,3
60488,"But, at just a little over a dollar a pair, it's not a bad buy.",60488,3
60489,I ordered a size larger and it still fits a bit small.,60489,3
60489,Neck line is a bit too high.,60489,3
60492,"As everybody already mentioned, these earings are very small.",60492,3
60492,"Furthermore, they are not very shiny, they are real diamonds but an average quality one.",60492,3
60492,"Sparkling, no so much, from a distance they look like regular stones.",60492,3
60492,"But for this price, they are good.",60492,3
60492,Note: please ignore my nails.,60492,3
60493,i ordered this for someone.,60493,3
60493,you should order a size smaller.,60493,3
60494,The necklace is very pretty in general.,60494,3
60494,"However, it does not glow in the dark.",60494,3
60495,One sock is smaller in size.,60495,3
60495,Anythin Made in China and always a problem/,60495,3
60496,i like the shirt the arms are too small,60496,3
60497,Looked exactly as pictured.,60497,3
60497,"No elastic at end of sleeves, though, so they move around a lot unless you roll them up.",60497,3
60499,The scarf itself is nice.,60499,3
60499,I just wish that it was longer.,60499,3
60500,i had to give these to my daughter because the run a little small,60500,3
60501,Shirt is a small,60501,3
60502,This ring is okay.,60502,3
60502,"The fit is comfortable and it is a good looking ring, however not as pictured.",60502,3
60502,The silver is more stainless and each outside band is narrower.,60502,3
60503,Soft but very large.,60503,3
60503,I ordered 2xl and could have gotten a XL.,60503,3
60507,This jacket is super cozy and definitely keeps you warm.,60507,3
60507,My only complaint is that the material is extremely sensitive.,60507,3
60507,After one day of wearing is I got those annoying little balls of fuzz under my arms and at the cuffs of the sleeves.,60507,3
60507,I did like the jacket enough that I bought another one in a different color thinking that chances are this jacket won't last long because of the material.,60507,3
60507,I think the price it a little high for the quality.,60507,3
60508,fun for the money.,60508,3
60510,"This is a great swim diaper, but fits WAY too small.",60510,3
60510,"My son wears 2T-3T clothing, so I bought the 3T and I ended up having to give it to my super skinny 18 month old nephew.",60510,3
60510,It fits him great.,60510,3
60511,Considered it would be smaller made in country it was.,60511,3
60511,Wear it backwards with tank top if you prefer not to be strangled.,60511,3
60512,"It's adorable, came ripped and the thread was very cheap.",60512,3
60512,My mother in law is stiching it up (hopefully) so I don't have to go through a return.,60512,3
60513,Nose pads too far down on my cheeks; not on my nose at all.,60513,3
60514,"I'm a sneaker collector, it came with no box.",60514,3
60514,Glue marks all over.,60514,3
60514,The black also had silver paint marks.,60514,3
60515,"Should have listened to other posts saying these weren't the 'real deal' they are knock off genie bras - and the also do not have the same pads, they are much thinner and slightly misshapen.",60515,3
60515,"The other big detractor for me, is that they only have the insert for the pads at the top portion (near the straps) instead of on the side like the original GB's have for replacing the padded liners, after washing - the side panels are sewn shut & I don't want to run the risk of tearing them should I try and remove the stitching.",60515,3
60515,"The product itself is stretchy enough, but the material is definitely thinner than the originals, so you do not get the same structure, or support than you would with the name brand version.",60515,3
60515,"If you don't mind a knock off for the price, then by all means order these as they won't disappoint, but I am not thrilled and wish I would have just bought them in the store and gotten what I wanted vs. getting what I was hoping would be as good a product as the original but for a slightly less price.",60515,3
60515,"Wound up spending more on bras then I originally planned as I had to buy a 2 pack in store this past weekend, on top of keeping these.",60515,3
60516,The material is thin.,60516,3
60516,Figuring out how to wear the shirt was difficult at first.,60516,3
60516,The long end with the fringe was just hanging down.,60516,3
60516,Not attached at the shoulder as pictured.,60516,3
60516,Overall I like it and plan to wear it often.,60516,3
60517,This item is wonderful in color.,60517,3
60517,I like the thin material.,60517,3
60517,Why does this green garment have a blue/teal neck trim?,60517,3
60517,This is not good.,60517,3
60517,I did not receive a return packing slip so I can return the item.,60517,3
60519,"The color is vibrant and beautiful, the material is soft as a baby's blanket.",60519,3
60519,"The one I have wasn't made very well, the last button hole the material is not sewed down and gaps open.",60519,3
60519,I plan to sew it down myself.,60519,3
60520,Somewhat ill fitting skirt.,60520,3
60521,Fits great and very comfortable!,60521,3
60521,"But this product is polyester, NOT a cotton blend as described in the description.",60521,3
60522,"Very nice but came out of the box a little bent, had to straighten but the metal is strong.",60522,3
60523,I like the top a lot but eh bottoms fit weird.,60523,3
60523,I wore the top with different bottoms,60523,3
60524,Love the color and they are super soft as smooth!!,60524,3
60524,"But, I wish they were more like leggings instead of footless tights.",60524,3
60524,"I've only tried them on, but based on the material, I'm afraid they are going to snag super easily when I do wear them.",60524,3
60525,I ordered this shirt because I already have one in yellow.,60525,3
60525,"The only thing I did not expect was unlike my yellow one, this one didn't come with a undershirt or a lining sewed into it.",60525,3
60525,Not sure if it's because they were bought from different seller's?,60525,3
60525,Even though it's the same shirt?,60525,3
60525,"Honestly, without the lining its more like a very sheer, very see through Poncho.",60525,3
60525,It still can be cute & able to be worn in public if you have light under shirt available to wear with it.,60525,3
60526,The texture of the socks is ideal.,60526,3
60526,They are thick enough that it will keep your legs warm and the knit pattern gives it a nice accent.,60526,3
60526,"My problem was that the top doesnt stretch well enough, so the socks end up cutting into my thighs and I look like an overstuffed sausage as opposed to the cool effortless look I wish to had.",60526,3
60526,I suppose they must be tight so they don't fall down but the look I wanted was not achieved.,60526,3
60527,socks are too thin,60527,3
60528,What is up with the cups in the front?,60528,3
60528,Disappointed in the appearance of it.,60528,3
60528,I bought one similar and loved it.,60528,3
60528,Just not crazy about the cups or fit on this particular one.,60528,3
60529,The dress in itself is a beautiful dress.,60529,3
60529,"I am however disappointed that although I usually wear a size medium or large, I ordered an extra large (XL) and is was too tight and small.",60529,3
60529,I am disappointed that I cannot use the dress.,60529,3
60529,This is my first experience shopping at this particular line of clothing.,60529,3
60530,I preferred the old ones fits much better but still a very good quality!,60530,3
60531,Awkward fit and very wide opening,60531,3
60532,In order to have it fit around my oversize belly I had to order the next larger size.,60532,3
60532,This size is way too big across my shoulders and chest.,60532,3
60532,The cut is proportionately too narrow around the waist.,60532,3
60533,not a high quality piece but priced accordingly,60533,3
60534,In the description it states that these shorts have no drawstring.,60534,3
60534,WRONG they do have a drawstring.,60534,3
60534,I ordered these because my husband does not like a drawstring so when they arrived I was shocked by the drawstring and had to go back to the item to show my husband that it said no drawstring.,60534,3
60534,You need to change the description.,60534,3
60535,"This dress is super pretty but crazy long, runs small in chest.",60535,3
60536,"Not too small, I mean it's just too short !",60536,3
60537,I wore it out and the finger hole broke within an hour.,60537,3
60537,I had to safety pin it.,60537,3
60537,"It's worth the price, but don't expect anything amazing.",60537,3
60538,Fit small and cheap fabric,60538,3
60539,They fitted well before washing but after washing (in cold water) they were rather snug,60539,3
60540,The straps on the top are pretty long making it hard to adjust for better support.,60540,3
60541,the top scrunchs but the rest fits well on my hour glass body.,60541,3
60542,Was originally looking for a coat ideal for winter.,60542,3
60542,This is more for fall season.,60542,3
60543,"Wife is 5' 1"" and no,where  near as long as shown.",60543,3
60544,Slip is the key word here.,60544,3
60544,"The material is very soft and silky, and THIN.",60544,3
60544,"The length is really short, and if you are curvy of course you know your curves will eat up most of the length.",60544,3
60544,I decided that my slip is now a shirt to wear under other shirts.,60544,3
60544,"It's cute, and depending on your level of modesty it could be a slip, or dress.",60544,3
60544,I think it's multifunctional.,60544,3
60545,Runs exceedingly small had to return and reorder...,60545,3
60545,I also had to cover the 13 dollar shipping cost and will take well over yet another month to arrive...so there are pros and cons.,60545,3
60546,It's big in the mid area and tight in the arms,60546,3
60547,The zipper can be kind of irritating.,60547,3
60547,"It will pull your hair, scratch your skin, catch on things, etc.",60547,3
60547,"If you're not rail-thin, this dress is not always flattering.",60547,3
60548,I liked the shirt but it was way too small.,60548,3
60548,Had to give it to my 14 year old son.,60548,3
60549,Fit perfect looked cheap,60549,3
60550,Bottoms are little small.,60550,3
60551,"It's on the small side, but is a decent jacket",60551,3
60552,breaks easily but it's cute,60552,3
60553,"I collect fun watches so was delighted to find this, but then of course it did not come with instructions as previously noted by other buyers.",60553,3
60553,"Thankfully, another purchaser had posted the instructions for setting, etc.",60553,3
60553,which I was able to print out.,60553,3
60553,Setting the watch's functions was complicated and it took me many tries to get it right.,60553,3
60553,"Although it is advertised as a woman's watch, it was much too big for my wrist (and I am not at all small), so had to pay to have a jeweler remove some links.",60553,3
60553,I have also found that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.,60553,3
60553,"It's a cute and fun watch, but I would never wear it if knowing the time was crucial.",60553,3
60553,"I am tempted to give it two stars, but I can't honestly say that I don't like it.",60553,3
60553,"I am disappointed, however, and am glad I didn't waste more money on it (I've seen it in catalogs for a much higher price)",60553,3
60554,I wear a size 4 and could not zip it up.,60554,3
60554,If you are thinking about getting this costume order at least 2 sizes larger.,60554,3
60555,The pattern is off as described previously.,60555,3
60555,Still nice though and a deal for the price.,60555,3
60556,I like the bag a lot but it stinks like fish.,60556,3
60556,Hopefully it airs out soon,60556,3
60559,A little on the dull side,60559,3
60560,"Lovely dress, if only the sizing is correct.",60560,3
60560,"I normally wear a medium, am 5'6, 138lbs and the large is still too close.",60560,3
60560,"I mean, it does fit since the material is stretchy, but being a bandage dress, all other bets are off if you have any flaws.",60560,3
60560,"I'm working out, so I am going to keep it.",60560,3
60561,"Nice belt but not 2 inches wide, only 1 1/2 inches wide.",60561,3
60561,Had to return and reorder.,60561,3
60562,Too large as 4T,60562,3
60563,Great item for its cost.,60563,3
60563,"Light, greta looks, I will not test the water resitance...",60563,3
60564,It is hard for men of European descent to find Japanese work clothes that can accommodate their proportionately longer arms & legs.,60564,3
60564,"I am of average size for my generation of Americans (5'10"") & Japanese size XXXL (or 3L) usually fits me well enough.",60564,3
60564,"The dungaree twill of these Chinese-made samue is of a comfortable, medium-weight cotton.",60564,3
60564,"Wash cold, partially line-dry, & iron while still damp to avoid shrinkage.",60564,3
60565,"I bought 2 of this color & 2 of another color for my 15 yr old daughter & my 15 yr old grandaughter and they both like them but i don't think in a year or two they would want to wear them, so i would have to say these neckless' are designed for young ladies 12 to 15 years old,",60565,3
60566,They were good quality but sized badly..,60566,3
60567,It fits but a little close,60567,3
60568,"As others have said, the top is very short and the sleeves are tight.",60568,3
60568,I normally wear a 4 and I ordered a medium.,60568,3
60568,"It fit fine, but I did have to wear a tank top under it and tried stretching out the elastic in the upper arms as much as possible.",60568,3
60568,"Still, a good deal for a costume.",60568,3
60569,"This bag does not impress me nor is it magical, but it does hold toiletries.",60569,3
60569,"The fact is, this bag is quite flimsy and it does not stand up on its own without being propped up against something.",60569,3
60569,This is an issue because the plastic hook meant for hanging the bag is rather small and won't fit around a thicker towel bar or a door handle.,60569,3
60569,"If you can't hang it up because of the tiny hook it has, then it is not really a hanging toiletry bag.",60569,3
60569,The zippers do not have a nice quality feel and are not the easiest to use.,60569,3
60569,They are very jerky due to the flimsiness of the bag.,60569,3
60569,When you load up the bag it doesn't keep its shape and this adds to the zippers being difficult.,60569,3
60569,"To be a great bag it would need a more solid structure, better zippers and a bigger hook not made of plastic.",60569,3
60569,"Basically, if you just want a bag to hold your toiletries during transport this will do, if you like to use a toiletry bag to work out of and keep your stuff organized throughout your trip, keep looking.",60569,3
60570,This bathing suit fits me perfectly.,60570,3
60570,I am a size 14/16 with a 38DDD.,60570,3
60570,The girls spill out a little but overall I'm so pleased.,60570,3
60570,I get so many compliments on it.,60570,3
60570,This is not coral however....  Its neon orange.,60570,3
60570,Kinda disappointed in that but oh well...,60570,3
60570,I leave for the beach tomorrow!,60570,3
60572,"The ring, yes, is adjustable but the metal is really thin and it feels like it's going to snap so I don't want to wear it.",60572,3
60573,smaller than the picture showed.,60573,3
60575,[Jason (husband)]  I was really looking for an ankle-length over coat.,60575,3
60575,This was the best I could find in my preference and price range.,60575,3
60575,"Other than the length, it is great!",60575,3
60576,"The color was darker then I thought it would be, I got it to match my wedding ring but it's to dark.",60576,3
60576,Besides that though it's a great necklace.,60576,3
60577,There is no writing on the back of the shirt.,60577,3
60577,"*Mischief Managed* :(

I just got the shirt so I haven't washed it, and only tried it on.",60577,3
60577,I bought a Men's Medium (I'm a size 12 female -6 foot tall) and it fits well- happy with with the body of the shirt.,60577,3
60577,"I was too afraid to take a risk ordering the women's cut and felt the men's cut was a safer bet, and fit.",60577,3
60577,"The sleeves of the shirt however are snug for a mens T-shirt which is weird, but for me it works, and it looks a lot less sloppy.",60577,3
60578,Beautiful jacket but be warned it runs extremely small.,60578,3
60578,I normally wear a medium sometime a large depending on the cut.,60578,3
60578,"I ordered this jacket in a XXXL and it's still too small, I'm 5'11"" an quite busty.",60578,3
60578,I can't button the jacket up and I had to remove the buttons from the cuffs of the sleeves to allow extra length for my arms.,60578,3
60578,It is a lightweight fabric and I don't plan on wearing it during the winter months so it'll serve it's purpose.,60578,3
60579,My daughter wears sz 12 so after reading the reviews I decided to buy her a size down and went with a 10.,60579,3
60579,It is way too big!!!,60579,3
60579,I'll have to have it altered.,60579,3
60580,It was a little small and didn't last long after one washing!!,60580,3
60580,Bottom hem came completely out!,60580,3
60581,"This ring is very cute, but the tip on the ""tail""end of the snake was sharp and dug into my toe, so I had to send back.",60581,3
60582,Pretty but I normally wear large and xxl is too tight on my hips.,60582,3
60582,Not Flowy at all.,60582,3
60583,Very cutee but broke after a couple of uses..,60583,3
60584,"Ok for the price but other reviews are right, feathers were falling off right out of the package and.they ae pretty small as.far as wings go.",60584,3
60585,I'd give these a higher rating except for the fact that they wouldn't fit my husband's head.,60585,3
60585,"All those cheapo flea market pairs he buys fit his head, why not these?",60585,3
60585,I ended up taking these for myself because they seem to be made for pin heads.,60585,3
60585,Not that I'm a pin head...  hmmm...,60585,3
60585,"Anyway... they fit me, but not him.",60585,3
60585,The quality isn't any higher than flea market.,60585,3
60585,"They do give a little in the stems, but being so small, they need to be.",60585,3
60585,"That flexibility doesn't impress me as a plus, it makes me worry more about the durability.",60585,3
60585,"Also, the lenses aren't very large either.. definitely goes better on a small head.",60585,3
60585,I watched a video of a guy trying these out and they looked good on him.,60585,3
60585,But now I can't shake the wondering I have about the guy's head size.,60585,3
60585,"Can't seem to get that out of my mind...  the greenish mirror look is kind of cool, but that's the only pro from my end.",60585,3
60585,They have a plasticy look about them.,60585,3
60585,"Oh, the case is hard case, but I can get hard cases at Wal-Mart for a couple of bucks all day long.",60585,3
60585,I'd rather the glasses were a fraction larger.,60585,3
60586,Perfect for a teenager,60586,3
60587,Fits too small unfortunately!!,60587,3
60587,Love the shirt....just wish I could wear it!,60587,3
60588,Broke in two days,60588,3
60589,Good fit but fabric could be lighter and softer.,60589,3
60590,I expected it to be bigger.,60590,3
60590,It also smells kinda funky lol,60590,3
60591,I love the style and fit of the sneaker but I'm not crazy about the color.,60591,3
60591,The description says black but it looks more like gray.,60591,3
60592,A little big on me.,60592,3
60593,Small in size than expected,60593,3
60595,They came not put together.,60595,3
60595,You have to put together the straps and puncture the holes yourself.,60595,3
60595,"I'm 5'8"" and it was a bit too short.",60595,3
60595,They're really cute though,60595,3
60596,Its nice but small on the arms but i think i can make it work.,60596,3
60596,Ill just be careful not to rip it.,60596,3
60596,"I bought a large but runs small but if i bought a xl, its probably gonna look baggy.",60596,3
60597,They'd be awesome if it weren't for the terrible stitching,60597,3
60598,Only issue is it arrived 3 weeks later than expected,60598,3
60599,These stay in place well and don't slide down over ankles.,60599,3
60599,"Not quite as sheer as I expected, but are great for work.",60599,3
60600,I was expecting it to be more like a cotton material.,60600,3
60600,It looks great on the featured model.,60600,3
60601,"I ordered 2X and it seems like it's a XL,...I would have liked a little more room in the shorts, other than that the material was nice....Just the
size was way too small....",60601,3
60602,But the style is good.,60602,3
60603,A little easily bendable but decent,60603,3
60604,Was in seperate pieces when arrived but easily reconnected soon problem.,60604,3
60604,Daughter gave to her 15 yr old friend and she loves it.,60604,3
60606,Its kinda cool looking but the material feels like cheap crafting felt.,60606,3
60606,The fur isn't much better.,60606,3
60606,"I was hoping to wear these inside my hunters and if you're envisioning the same, just turn away.",60606,3
60606,they don't really fit well over the top of my hunter rain boots.,60606,3
60607,I ordered these and another style with a high waist band from the same brand.,60607,3
60607,Both the same size.,60607,3
60607,The other ones for great but these were too snug and the waist had to be pulled up repeatedly during yoga.,60607,3
60607,Overall a cute legging but maybe size up?,60607,3
60608,Don't really care for them.,60608,3
60608,They make noise when you open them to put them on your face like a plastic sound.,60608,3
60608,I ordered the matte pair.,60608,3
60609,I am keeping this for a night shirt.,60609,3
60609,I ordered a large and it might fit an anorexic teen.,60609,3
60610,They are very slim and lightweight.,60610,3
60610,The only thing I was a little discouraged about was how wide they were.,60610,3
60610,"Almost too wide for my face, but they are a decent buy for the price.",60610,3
60611,it is too small....,60611,3
60612,"Although this vest is much more realistic than a typical commercial costume piece, there were a few issues.",60612,3
60612,It's a little longer than it's supposed to be but otherwise was sized reasonably close to the described sizing.,60612,3
60612,"The vest was really stringy though, and I had to cut hanging threads off of nearly every seam.",60612,3
60612,I worried I would actually cut a seam so I had to leave some threads hanging.,60612,3
60613,This hat is extremely large.,60613,3
60613,Way to big for the average adults head.,60613,3
60613,Nice material and design but it runs extremely large,60613,3
60614,But I love it.,60614,3
60615,Length was great however the dress didn't hang off of me the way I thought it would.,60615,3
60616,"bulkier than i thought it would be, but still nice sturdy construction",60616,3
60617,Good but tooooo small,60617,3
60618,"I like the watch, but the clip to open it broke the first time I opened it to see the face.",60618,3
60619,It is not as elegant as I thought it would be.,60619,3
60619,"Also, I thought the double zipper would have two separate compartments but they open to the same compartment and the back one (front of purse having the flap) is set back so it isn't as easy access.",60619,3
60619,I also thought there would be like credit card slots under the flap and it is just a small zippered compartment.,60619,3
60619,"I like the size, the feel is okay quality.",60619,3
60619,It is a simple purse and thought it would have a lot more organization to it.,60619,3
60619,A bit disappointed but I am a purse freak and will keep it.,60619,3
60619,"Personally, not worth the cost even getting it at a reduced price.",60619,3
60619,"Not really a bad purse, just not what I expected.",60619,3
60619,"Read other reviews that stated it didn't hold up very well, I will see and re-post if I find out the same thing.",60619,3
60621,I ordered white and got grey.,60621,3
60621,Still a very pretty shirt but I wanted completely white for a bachelorette afternoon,60621,3
60622,Too big on arms,60622,3
60623,"It's extremely cute, but it fits my head.",60623,3
60623,It's way too big for my 5 month old.,60623,3
60623,maybe it will fit her better in a few years but as of now it covers her eyes and there's no way she can wear it.,60623,3
60625,I like the way it feels but its just a little too small i can fit it but kinda tight but it makes me look great,60625,3
60626,"Returned it because the ""leather"" looks so fake up close.",60626,3
60627,Clear plastic is the only thing that makes it feel cheap.,60627,3
60628,The dress us alright.,60628,3
60628,Now that I have it I am not in love with it like I was before.,60628,3
60628,It fits my waist but that it about it.,60628,3
60628,The bust is way too big and the dress is way too long.,60628,3
60628,I ordered the blue gradient dress and there is purple in it.,60628,3
60629,"Small small small, fits like an USA size  small/med for large.",60629,3
60629,"Not for the big busted, will be giving away as a gift to a family member with small just.",60629,3
60630,The actual product doesn't really have any of the gathering effect at the bottom.,60630,3
60630,Top also has more white that colored parts.,60630,3
60630,Still a pretty nice dress.,60630,3
60630,"This dress, however, doesn't fit the way American clothes tend to.",60630,3
60630,An American small is probably a large in this dress and a medium would be an XL.,60630,3
60630,"If you are larger than a medium in a normal mall store, or if you are any permutation of 'curvy', 'busty', or shapely', you probably won't fit.",60630,3
60630,Any larger than a 'B-C' cup will not fit in the top.,60630,3
60630,"I am a busty medium, purchased a large, and I fell out all over the place.",60630,3
60630,"Also, the zipper in the back sticks pretty badly, but that could be because the dress fit me poorly.",60630,3
60630,I would only purchase this dress if you are slender for your height and not too chesty.,60630,3
60632,"arms are very tight, otherwise nice jacket.",60632,3
60633,That is  easy n general use,60633,3
60634,It's a tee shirt,60634,3
60635,It does NOT match the color that I received.,60635,3
60635,I am thinking of returning it - it is really and ugly color,60635,3
60637,"Runs big, I have a regular size head and had to pull the strap in the back almost all the way which made it look weird, otherwise light weight, nice color",60637,3
60638,"Loves this outfit, but unfortunately the zipper recently broke on the shorts.",60638,3
60639,"When I received the shirt, it had a hole in the front, other than that the shirt is alright.",60639,3
60639,"I like the fabric, but the print looks a little cheap.",60639,3
60640,"Ok quality, about a half size too small.",60640,3
60640,"Still fits, but the fabric stretches the buttons out over my bust.",60640,3
60640,Ended up having to buy a different sweater for my Dolores Umbridge cosplay.,60640,3
60641,Our son loved the long tie.,60641,3
60642,Vans fit as well as expected for Vans.,60642,3
60642,"They run a tad small, and have minimal arch support",60642,3
60643,"I'm 5'6"" 130lb got a medium... its pretty small.",60643,3
60643,and pretty sure if I put it in the washer it will become a baby tee.,60643,3
60643,just kind of a weird crop fit and fairly short sleeves too.,60643,3
60643,I love the idea of it but just not as cute as I thought it would be.,60643,3
60643,not a huge fan of the neckline stitching either.,60643,3
60643,will probably keep as a night time sleep tee,60643,3
60644,"Seemed great at first, but the glued sections are coming apaet at the seams.",60644,3
60645,Little tight in bust area.,60645,3
60645,The nude instead of black material was off but didn't have time to send back.,60645,3
60646,Scratchy and stiff material.,60646,3
60646,"I am 4'11"", 100 lbs I am a XS or S but ordered size M based on the description, it fits fine but a little long for me.",60646,3
60647,Yes we papal process.,60647,3
60647,While this is a really cute dress it does not fit all sizes the 5X was purchased and supposed to be at 1820 but unfortunately the bodice is way too small.,60647,3
60647,This bodice is made for a flat-chested young lady or tween.,60647,3
60647,It did fit my granddaughter who wears extra-large and has a flat chest .,60647,3
60647,The waste in swing of the skirt does stretch some and is large and would be probably fit a 2022 it is the bodice that is too small.,60647,3
60647,So if you have like a  36B chest I would suggest going up to the larger size dress just so that it would fit your bodice.,60647,3
60647,Dress is made of a cotton blend it does have a slight stretch to it and has a zipper in the back.,60647,3
60648,"Fits okay, just wished the sleeves were a bit longer.",60648,3
60648,"I like to pull them half past my hands, certainly not possible.",60648,3
60648,"I'm pretty sure once I wash it, it'll shrink and go slightly above my wrists.",60648,3
60648,"I did some adjustments, added some zippers on the front.",60648,3
60648,"UPDATE: I got size 8-10, I'm 110lbs 5'4"" I washed it and sleeves shrunk a bit, but not too bad.",60648,3
60648,Here is what I did with the zippers.,60648,3
60649,The previous pair I owned were perfect.,60649,3
60649,"This is the same size, style, etc., and they don't fit as well and have rubbed blisters on a couple toes.",60649,3
60649,Odd that it's the exact same everything except for that.,60649,3
60650,not that good for blocking sun,60650,3
60651,"Took a full 4 weeks to arrive, and it's small.",60651,3
60651,The fabric is interesting - kind of shinny and athletic rather than the cotton it looks like.,60651,3
60652,The size is to small.,60652,3
60653,"The underwear themselves are fine, but I thought I was ordering underwear with Mickey and tractors/farm equipment/etc., as shown.",60653,3
60653,I received plain old Mickey and friends nothing special underwear.,60653,3
60653,"Try explaining to a 3-year old that he's no longer getting underwear with tractors and such, just Mickey.",60653,3
60654,I like the thickness and style of the strap but my sample is more peach colored than the image shown here on Amazon.,60654,3
60654,"I couldn't quite capture the ""pinkness"" of the strap in my included photo- just imagine one more shade towards pink.",60654,3
60654,Perhaps I received the wrong strap color?,60654,3
60654,"Anyway, proceed with caution.",60654,3
60655,Nice hate but too small for my head.,60655,3
60656,Asian sizes maybe or the description should read junior sizes.,60656,3
60656,"order 2 sizes bigger next time, but customer service is great.",60656,3
60657,Small but really cute,60657,3
60658,Very cute but the elastic isn't very tight to hold it up.,60658,3
60658,The back kept sagging.,60658,3
60659,But it turned my finger green after only 3 days of wear.,60659,3
60659,Fits true to size and beautiful on.,60659,3
60659,I was wearing it as a right hand ring.,60659,3
60660,This is a solid bag for the price.,60660,3
60660,"It's really lightweight, and folds up easily.",60660,3
60660,"However, durability is lacking.",60660,3
60660,"Keep in mind, though, we did ask a lot of them: we used them as carry-ons for a three week trip through Europe to maximize on a tight weight limit.",60660,3
60660,One split at the zipper seam while we were boarding out outbound flight.,60660,3
60660,The other survived for a week before the loop to clip the shoulder strap to ripped off.,60660,3
60660,"Otherwise, they hung in their for the duration and we managed to make it home with them!",60660,3
60661,Arms and chest too small,60661,3
60662,Love the style however the edge is jagged.,60662,3
60662,It wasn't finished very well.,60662,3
60662,It was a gift for my sister so was slightly disappointed.,60662,3
60663,But they will be used,60663,3
60664,Not full flare as shown in picture!,60664,3
60664,It is an A -line godet skirt,60664,3
60666,The 0-6 month size is more like a 2 year old size.,60666,3
60667,"I like the blouse,  but sizing was not correct-so I had to return it.",60667,3
60667,"The 3 stars if for the blouse itself, just make sure you order a larger size.",60667,3
60668,"I ordered a L just in case, and it was STILL too small...I'm glad my daughter can wear it.",60668,3
60668,What a beautiful piece.,60668,3
60668,very disappointed in the size measurements...,60668,3
60668,"I needed to get an XL or maybe even a XXL, in order for it to fit like a regular M (I'm regular size 8/10).",60668,3
60669,"the product fit, but is not nearly anything like an actual triangl bathingsuit; which is what it is supposed to resemble.",60669,3
60669,and not made out of the material it says it is,60669,3
60670,Shipped fast and fit good,60670,3
60671,never really use it.,60671,3
60671,too hard to put on,60671,3
60672,Looked just like the picture.,60672,3
60672,Sad part is that they make them for really really really skinny people and no matter what size you buy it's going to be small.,60672,3
60673,"the sexy bites were for my grandson who is into magic and vampires, he was a little upset that they had to mold around his teeth he is only 9 years old.",60673,3
60674,Built quality is good but it's too small.. Not a product for a big guy..,60674,3
60675,maybe i just expected to much,60675,3
60677,somewhat small in shoulders; the big issue was that the zipper was silver and on the ladies design side of the jacket.,60677,3
60678,Nice shirt but way too small for a 2X.,60678,3
60679,I bought this wallet in July 2015.,60679,3
60679,It holds a lot of items well but the top seam came apart after six months.,60679,3
60680,This thing is huge.,60680,3
60680,I'm 5'9 and usually wear a size 4-6.,60680,3
60680,It is huge and may not stay up!,60680,3
60681,I got this for my 10yr old and it Started falling apart after 3 months of school.,60681,3
60682,Love the quality for the price.,60682,3
60682,Color was what I needed.,60682,3
60682,Don't like the gold clasp as I prefer silver.,60682,3
60683,"Nicely made, and more or less what I was looking for but its too small for me.",60683,3
60683,"I am normally a medium, which is what I ordered, but the shoulder width and sleeves are uncomfortably tight.",60683,3
60684,"I'm 5'3"" and weigh 135 and this was too big on me",60684,3
60685,Looks as expected but was larger than I anticipated.,60685,3
60685,"Very light material, not very sturdy.",60685,3
60685,"I put on a better, longer chain and I was happy with it.",60685,3
60686,My daugther bough this item and it was a bit short on the front but still a perfect fit.,60686,3
60686,The  only bad thing  is that it was Completely transparent,60686,3
60687,Some what larger on me then expected but still happy,60687,3
60688,It was too big I'm a size 4 in jeans medium for tope just didn't fit and it seem like if it were to fit the  strings from the back were a little off,60688,3
60689,"I'd like to give four stars but I went with 3 for a few reasons:
I thought it was going to be red white and blue based on the picture in color.",60689,3
60689,"It it's actually black, not blue.",60689,3
60689,"Also, it's circles and not stars.",60689,3
60689,The other reason I didn't love it was because I have to wear a cami or something underneath.,60689,3
60689,The arm holes are much too long and my bra always shows if I don't.,60689,3
60689,"That being said, I still like the shirt very much and have worn it a few times.",60689,3
60689,"Another good point to mention was that It arrived much quicker than I had expected, especially coming from China.",60689,3
60689,"It should be noted that there are no care instructions on this shirt anywhere to be found, not even on the packaging.",60689,3
60689,"However, taking a risk and crossing my fingers, I washed it in a delicate cycle in cold water and it came out fine.",60689,3
60689,"It is a very fine, cheap material so I don't expect to have this shirt for years to come, but if I can wear it memorial day, fourth of July, and labor day I'd say I got my money worth.",60689,3
60690,"It seems to run large & the saying runs way down to the crouch, so you wouldn't be able to wear pants or shorts with it.",60690,3
60690,"But, that said, love the way it looks.",60690,3
60690,Seems to be good quality.,60690,3
60691,I purchased this product for a boudoir shoot.,60691,3
60691,The product was too small and had to be returned.,60691,3
60692,Size runs small and snug to the foot.,60692,3
60693,Too small in the buttocks area for me.,60693,3
60693,I have a curvy body so this did not work,60693,3
60694,"My grand daughter is turning 2 loves it, but the way the zipper is placed within the one eye, it looks like there is 2-1/2 eyes.",60694,3
60695,It was a nice shirt.,60695,3
60695,it said it was a Tall on the tag but is was not.,60695,3
60696,"Returned because it was too big, got smaller size",60696,3
60697,"It was a bit snug, but other than that she loved it!",60697,3
60698,It was smaller than advertised.,60698,3
60699,very pretty but bra area is too large and padding inside is stiff and doesn't hold up well.,60699,3
60700,"Comfortable and not itchy, but one size definitely doesn't fit all.",60700,3
60700,These are way to big if your a size 2 and under.,60700,3
60701,"Very cute, but the top was a different shade of red and green than the bottoms.",60701,3
60702,I am a size medium all day long and this garment was too small.,60702,3
60702,It also hung too long in the front for my likings but I'm only 5 feet tall so this might not be a problem for taller women.,60702,3
60702,"Otherwise it was a nice garment, nice material and well made.",60702,3
60702,I'm not getting a bigger size because of the length.,60702,3
60703,Thought this was a great looking product and was super happy.,60703,3
60703,I have been using it for four days and the lining stitching is already coming undone.,60703,3
60703,And the purse zipper isn't the best it's a struggle to zip it close or open.,60703,3
60705,"You must wear something underneath, 1 wear and the seam already split (right side bottom of the side seam)",60705,3
60706,Beautiful but too tight in the bust,60706,3
60707,i got silver not gold,60707,3
60709,"The dress fit pretty well (was slightly loose) and the material was wonderful, but the zipper was total trash.",60709,3
60709,"There was nothing obstructing the zipper and the dress wasn't tight at all, but the zipper would not budge on the night I needed to wear the dress.",60709,3
60709,My advice is to plan on having someone change out the zipper before an event.,60709,3
60711,This dress will be my bridal shower tea party dress!,60711,3
60711,I can't wear a hat so this dress will do the job with the right necklace.,60711,3
60712,I really liked these but after a few wears they are starting to run.,60712,3
60713,"Item was WAY too small, and I ordered 2 sizes bigger.",60713,3
60713,I just passed it to my friend.,60713,3
60714,Nice dress but not for heavily breasted woman,60714,3
60715,"cant get the day to set, going to take it to the watch shop by my house to see if they can figure it out.a little bit hard to see in the day but that's fine.",60715,3
60715,but over all it cool .its comfortable and lite.,60715,3
60716,"works for my needs, but thinner than expected.",60716,3
60718,"Worked ok for a while, then after less than a year dead.",60718,3
60718,When they did work they would occasionally cut out with my phone in a pouch at my waist.,60718,3
60718,Sound was ok/ what I would expect for inexpensive earbuds.,60718,3
60720,Too large but I will keep it.,60720,3
60720,It's nice fabric and lays nicely.,60720,3
60720,The color is nice as it goes with everything.,60720,3
60720,I got the brown one.,60720,3
60720,You have to wear something underneath as it is sheer.,60720,3
60721,This is a really cute top & made out of quality material but definitely runs small.,60721,3
60721,It also took about a month to arrive.,60721,3
60721,I would order it again but I would order a size or two above what you would normally get.,60721,3
60723,Too narrow for my foot.,60723,3
60724,2 1/2 years after purchase the lining is disintegrating.,60724,3
60724,No other leather wallet I've ever owned started to disintegrate this quickly.,60724,3
60725,"Cute, but it's for left handed people so I'm keeping as a gift for a friend.",60725,3
60726,I love the colors and the style.,60726,3
60727,Not meant for petite individuals.,60727,3
60727,It looks very similar to a potato sack.,60727,3
60728,"It's ok, but feel and looks cheap.",60728,3
60728,the picture makes this top look a lot better.,60728,3
60729,runs quite large compared to other brands,60729,3
60730,"Upon opening the package, I saw that the case was cracked.",60730,3
60730,The case was wrapped in an impossible amount of tape which made it difficult to open.,60730,3
60730,The included tool is pretty cheaply made and bends very easily.,60730,3
60731,Way smaller then size,60731,3
60732,I would've given this a 5 star if the little charm held it's design.,60732,3
60732,The charm's paint got dirty easy and the design was removed as soon as i removed from my pocket when i first got it.,60732,3
60732,It cuts well but leaves grooves on whatever you cut.,60732,3
60732,But over all a good bandage scissor.,60732,3
60732,I got it for a friend with another design and he liked it.,60732,3
60733,"The color is nice, but was a little",60733,3
60734,"The shirt is true to size, and the material is a good cotton shirt.",60734,3
60734,The negative side is we followed the washing instructions and hung it to dry and the Raiders face and mask bled together so it's hard to distinguish what the picture is.,60734,3
60735,I lIke these spaghetti strap tops but they are really tight in the armpit area and high on the neck.,60735,3
60735,Also they collect any balls of lint and material from the dryer so get a lint roller,60735,3
60737,"I bought these for my septum, thinking they were super cute.",60737,3
60737,Once I got it in I did not like the way it laid.,60737,3
60737,You can't see the diamonds and it looks kinda tacky from the side.,60737,3
60737,"The sizing are nice, the middle one fit will in my nose, and the screw in seems sturdy.",60737,3
60737,Though I will not wear it in my septum I am sure I will find other uses for them.,60737,3
60737,So just an F.Y.I if your thinking of buying for your septum make sure you are ok with it not being able to show off the diamonds ( as they point straight down).,60737,3
60737,"I would recommend these for earrings, and even a belly button ring, but not a septum.",60737,3
60738,The colors are great but the T-Shirts are of different sizes even though I ordered a 2T & the shirts read 2T.,60738,3
60739,"Very nice shirt, but was not as long to cover my bum how I like it.. it fit snagged and I got a bigger size up...",60739,3
60740,"Not black, dark grey.",60740,3
60741,"product is ok, but the size was too big for a medium size adult.",60741,3
60742,Order your aspirational size not your actual size.,60742,3
60743,If you have some what big hips definitely get a size bigger other than that is s very nice skirt,60743,3
60744,weird shape but cute,60744,3
60745,Super cute but a size too small I ordered a size up at 11 an it was same size as his 10's he was currently wearing from vans,60745,3
60746,I have an odd shape so may just be my body but fit slightly tight not bad at all and I live the flow.,60746,3
60746,"I'm 5 3""so of course I wear with heels and I feel amazing in them.",60746,3
60746,Makes my legs look long and slim.,60746,3
60747,"The dress is very shear, might work great for a swim suit cover up.",60747,3
60747,"Ordered as a dress so it didn't work out great for my need, vendor refunded my money so I am happy with the outcome.",60747,3
60748,Band broke after less than a week of wear.,60748,3
60748,Face is nice but hard to read.,60748,3
60749,My medium black petite  ones fit better.,60749,3
60749,These are a bit  tight,60749,3
60751,I like the bag however I wish there was a snap closure for security reasons.,60751,3
60752,Cap is nice but was somewhat small so be careful if you have a full size noggin.,60752,3
60753,I like the hat but it is small,60753,3
60754,The feet fit fine but it left lines above the ankle and felt like it was to tight.,60754,3
60754,"I still like them, just don't sleep in them.",60754,3
60755,hard to get  on the ear so don't wear,60755,3
60757,The fit of the bottom was weird.,60757,3
60757,"It was a little loose looking, and I bought my regular size.",60757,3
60758,Doesnt look as nice.,60758,3
60759,Beautiful stone...but it broke in half after a few weeks.,60759,3
60759,The small stones however kept trying to fall off and come unglued.,60759,3
60759,"I put two back on myself, but lost one when I was only god knows where.",60759,3
60759,"Good product, but needs a but of work.",60759,3
60760,But runs really small.,60760,3
60760,Go 2 sizes up for a comfortable fit and more flexibility to make adjustments.,60760,3
60760,Hence the 3 stars.,60760,3
60760,Vut I would certainly recommend!,60760,3
60761,"These are cute, but plan on having green fingers, especially if you are sensitive.",60761,3
60761,"(Some of them look VERY cheap, while a couple looked really adorable!)",60761,3
60762,"I normally wear a 36 size waist and they said it ran a bit small so ordered a pair of 38 thinking it would give me a bit of room, they were kinda tight and they fit snug",60762,3
60763,Very cool print but I think I have a long torso.,60763,3
60763,Plus the head of the cat stretches weird over my chest.,60763,3
60763,"I have an athletic, slender build but I do have a 36"" back and a C cup.",60763,3
60764,The zipper doesn't  close right and not all the way,60764,3
60765,The bottom is perfect.,60765,3
60765,The top is way too large.,60765,3
60765,I'm a 38C and it's very wide and the cups are huge.,60765,3
60766,"This does look a little cheap, but for the price, I was expecting anything brilliant!",60766,3
60766,The colors are vibrant and it goes well with some outfits I have.,60766,3
60767,Was what I expected.,60767,3
60768,"Fit and color weren't quite as expected, but excellent customer service and was a no hassle return.",60768,3
60769,"Overall, it's a decent bag with good functionality.",60769,3
60769,The bag is little on the heavy side even empty.,60769,3
60769,The goldtone accessories make the bag look tacky.,60769,3
60769,"To save cost, the buckles on handles in the front and back are different.",60769,3
60769,Only the front handle has the decorated design and not the back.,60769,3
60769,I've never seen this even in the cheaper handbags.,60769,3
60770,"Needs instructions, this is impossible to try to figure out how to put together on your own without instructions or a photograph...",60770,3
60770,Very poor packaging and intended product usage .,60770,3
60770,If I didn't want one so much I might just return it out of sheer annoyance.,60770,3
60771,"Very thin, but I double up so it works well.",60771,3
60772,I couldn't zip it up with out it being to tight.,60772,3
60772,I got a 2x because I wanted it to be big and not tight.,60772,3
60772,I wear between a 1x and a 2x.,60772,3
60772,Other than that It worked.,60772,3
60773,"okay quality, okay sparkly",60773,3
60774,Returned the product as it was too small...,60774,3
60775,I love this bracelet and my bf is really into nautical stuff but the strands of braid holding the nautical charms is really thin .,60775,3
60776,You get what you pay for but it looks  pretty nice to be fake my elephant ring broke immediately,60776,3
60777,They are cute and I like them but because of my extremely high arch they cut into the top of my foot after about an hour.,60777,3
60777,This is not a fault of the sandal though.,60777,3
60778,Some of the rhinestones came out after only a day or two.,60778,3
60778,"Wish I would've used it just for ""show"" and not for purpose - I don't take my navel ring out regularly so this wasn't a great selection for me.",60778,3
60778,When you get it - Wear it with a cute outfit & replace it with one that's a little more sturdy.,60778,3
60779,The top lacks support.,60779,3
60781,I did not realize that I had ordered a woman's t-shirt.,60781,3
60781,"As a 6'-3"" man, that did not work out very well.",60781,3
60782,It's a little too large and loose (baggy) for what I like in this size category.,60782,3
60782,Every brand is different.,60782,3
60783,"I'm 5'9"" and ~130 lbs.",60783,3
60783,and these fit as expected in Medium.,60783,3
60783,"I like how the panties are breathable and comfy, but the black pair which came in my multipack is falling apart after just one wash on delicate.",60783,3
60783,The waistband separated from the rest and is rapidly unraveling.,60783,3
60783,"The others appear visually to be ok on the stitching, but I will update this review if the rest from the pack also start coming undone.",60783,3
60783,The patterns and colors are nice.,60783,3
60784,Tarnished very very fast.,60784,3
60784,Loved the design though.,60784,3
60786,The booties were given as a baby shower gift.,60786,3
60786,They look like they will easily fit a 1 or 2 year old although they are labeled in several spots as size 3-6 months.,60786,3
60786,Since the baby isn't due until the end of February I don't know if and when they will actually fit.,60786,3
60786,"However, we all love the softness and they look very comfortable.",60786,3
60786,the mom would like a pair just like them.,60786,3
60788,the top fits like a med not LG the bottom fits great tho top is way my shorter then it looks in pic but it is the same outfit u see to a T the sizes are off tho top not gonna match the bottom in size and I don't have triple D's Brest lolol but it is a nice sexy outfit tho and it came fast too so that's a plus,60788,3
60789,I have been trying to find something like this for a while but wasn't sure how I would look in it.,60789,3
60789,"I am 5'2"" 140lbs but I carry it mainly in my hips, butt and thighs.",60789,3
60789,First off the material is pretty cheap but for $12.00 it was better than I thought it would be.,60789,3
60789,"Second, the top was so small it was crazy small however  the bottom fit great.",60789,3
60789,"For the price I think it was a good purchase, I am definitely going to wear the skirt a lot, don't know if I'll be able to pull the top off.",60789,3
60790,These are all great quality however we were  looking for loose fitting and they are not.,60790,3
60790,That is why I give them a 3 -  if your looking for a very snug fit they will be perfect for you!,60790,3
60792,Great way to show your support on the cheap.,60792,3
60792,Not sure of long term use since not embroidered.,60792,3
60793,"My regular size is medium, those are too small for me.",60793,3
60794,"The quality of this item seemed ok, about appropriate for a beach town or by the pool, which is what I wanted.",60794,3
60794,The top has bra cups which is nice.,60794,3
60794,There were many lose threads on the bottom but nothing you couldn't take care of.,60794,3
60794,"It was, however very very LARGE.",60794,3
60794,"I am 110 lbs and 5'3"", typically an extra small.",60794,3
60794,I bought a small and it was enormous.,60794,3
60794,Literally so big there would have been no way for me to wear it.,60794,3
60795,Too narrow on the sides.,60795,3
60796,I returned the item due to an issue with the size.,60796,3
60796,It runs a little large.,60796,3
60796,"However, the tee is adorable and made of quality fabric.",60796,3
60798,"The suit was beautiful, but the top was far too large.",60798,3
60798,It was much larger than described.,60798,3
60798,I loved the look of the suit.,60798,3
60798,"It was well made, and super cute.",60798,3
60798,I wish it would have fit better because I loved it!,60798,3
60799,Looks great but seems to separate easily,60799,3
60800,Feel like they are poorly made.,60800,3
60800,Losing some threads after only one wear.,60800,3
60801,"These were ordered for my 7 yr. old daughter, and fit me @ 5'1 123lbs.",60801,3
60801,Hopefully will shrink when washed to fit her as intended.,60801,3
60801,They are warm and cozy on the inside very fuzzy.,60801,3
60802,The material is too stretchy so it becomes too big,60802,3
60803,"I am usually a size 4 or 6, 34 C bra size and buy small or medium depending on the cut of the suit.",60803,3
60803,"I have a curvier butt so I ordered a large and it just fits, no wiggle room though.",60803,3
60804,"liked the style of this bracelet, but it's way too tight, and I don't have a large wrist",60804,3
60805,The collar is a messy and workmanship is a bit low quality.,60805,3
60806,Not is the best quality,60806,3
60808,Love the color I order a xl and it fits good except the arms are a little small but I think I have pretty long arms in 5'5 150 pounds .,60808,3
60808,"Also the material is bad, it will not keep you warm it more of a long sleeve shirt , not a sweater .",60808,3
60809,I have trouble with suits.,60809,3
60809,I am large bust and need a large size for the top but then the bottoms are loose.. this has great tummy control.. but the material gets to thin around the bottom.,60809,3
60809,I might of been able to go one size down.,60809,3
60809,I am an older lady so all you ladies out there know how hard it is to find a suit that you feel comfy in..,60809,3
60809,I still have assets to show off but I want to still be covered..  this suit will show your curves and hide any fluff you might have in the mid section..,60809,3
60810,Got a ton of duplicates and didn't get my full 100,60810,3
60811,"It's a cute shirt, cut small, very shear but interesting nonetheless.",60811,3
60811,It's also very short waisted so it rides higher than in the photos,60811,3
60812,It is a very cute outfit and fit perfectly but the shirt had a pink tint it wasn't white.,60812,3
60813,It was somewhat large but looks great,60813,3
60814,The quality is great.,60814,3
60814,"However, while the description says four, my package came with only one ring in it.",60814,3
60816,"not well constructed, item broke on the first wear",60816,3
60817,"I love the blouse and the color was as shown , it does run small but i did order a bigger size so it would fit .It came earlier than expected .",60817,3
60817,"I would most definitely order again ,,, Not to mention i got a lot of compliments !",60817,3
60818,"Had a odd fabric texture, very stretchy and cute, but just didn't look right on my body type.",60818,3
60819,"very pretty, just too small and I ordered a larger size than normal.",60819,3
60820,it was missing one stone and one of the leaves had broken off.,60820,3
60821,It was tricky figuring out which size to get.,60821,3
60821,"I'm normally a small in everything, but a size 1 felt uncomfortably tight.",60821,3
60821,"Size 2 is comfortable, but I think it's too loose to actually hold my pants up.",60821,3
60821,Wearing the belly band also made me feel very hot after wearing it for only an hour.,60821,3
60821,I think this might work better later in pregnancy (i'm at the end of the 1st trimester).,60821,3
60822,very wide and short,60822,3
60823,Looks great the magnet that holds it together came out of it tho and have had to hot glue it back in,60823,3
60824,"bottoms are too small, they went in the trash which was okay for the price.",60824,3
60824,"the top is fine but not very sturdy, I don't expect long life from it",60824,3
60825,it didn't fit well I got medium and I'm 34c and I probably got it in a large.,60825,3
60825,also the tying is to complicated for me.,60825,3
60826,"I am 5'7, 175lbs, got a size L (14-16) and I could not get it down at all to button it up at the crotch.",60826,3
60826,The mesh material is beautiful and shiny.,60826,3
60826,One of the best mesh materials I have seen on items in Amazon.,60826,3
60826,The bodysuit is also made out of cotton so it will not last as much as professional dancer bodysuits.,60826,3
60826,You need a short torso for this.,60826,3
60827,I really didn't expect it to be such a large purse.,60827,3
60827,I like the design and the wallet but for me the purse was just too big.,60827,3
60827,I won't be using it as much as I thought I would.,60827,3
60828,"Looks so cute in the photo, but when I tried it on it has a super weird fit around the boob area.",60828,3
60829,Wish it had pockets,60829,3
60830,"This is a pretty tunic but as previously mentioned the ""v"" is cut much deeper in the front than the picture shows!",60830,3
60830,"I am blushing just thinking about it ;) the thought of having ""the girls"" spill out is a lucid one.",60830,3
60830,I tried manipulating the draw strings but the front just would not close any further.,60830,3
60830,"Also, the fit runs a bit small, I'm a 14/16 normally wearing a XL I ordered a XXL and it's tight in the hip area.",60830,3
60830,Overall very pretty and a good buy for the price.,60830,3
60831,The material was really cheap and thin.. almost see through.,60831,3
60831,It worked out bc I was wearing it in Miami during Ultra music festival so I stayed cool,60831,3
60832,Ordered a large and it fits like a medium.,60832,3
60833,I usually wear anywhere from an Extra Small to a Small...,60833,3
60833,I think in these pants I should have bought a medium.,60833,3
60833,Only because they are just to short...,60833,3
60834,This onesie was for my 9 year old daughter.,60834,3
60834,We knew it would probably be too large for her but there was no girl size available and she really wanted it.,60834,3
60835,Loose on 5yr old and lense keeps popping out,60835,3
60836,"Cheap feeling, does NOT look like the  model trust the pictures that people posted.",60836,3
60836,THIS DRESS IS SEE THROUGH!,60836,3
60838,Beautiful jumpsuit but had a whole in it and way too big.,60838,3
60838,I ordered a ex large size 160,60838,3
60839,for the price the quality is not great.,60839,3
60839,the sizing is like a youth size.,60839,3
60840,Love it but a bit small,60840,3
60841,It does not cover as much as the pictures show,60841,3
60843,Didn't wash very well - but was comfortable.,60843,3
60843,Doesn't seem to be worth the price.,60843,3
60844,I would order 3 times biger,60844,3
60845,Well made and sturdy but extremely large.,60845,3
60845,Must have a big head to fit this one.,60845,3
60846,love the pendant but it doesnt stay on the right side it flips be cause the peice that holds is sideways,60846,3
60847,"Not crazy about the 'slinky' material or the way the bottom is kind of, not tight but I just wish it had a slit to make easier to walk in.",60847,3
60848,But one hurts my son's feet,60848,3
60850,Its kinda small but it works good,60850,3
60851,I love mermaid stuff!,60851,3
60851,I was hoping that this would be a really cute bikini top option.,60851,3
60851,It's more costume like than it is a real swimsuit.,60851,3
60851,"I think it would be cute for a Halloween costume, if you were to wear something underneath like a long sleeve nude shirt.",60851,3
60851,I wear about a 34D and was hoping a medium would fit but I expected it might be a little bit small.,60851,3
60851,"It was, unfortunately, much too small.",60851,3
60851,It sort of stuck out instead of wrapping around my body.,60851,3
60851,I ended up giving it to a friend instead.,60851,3
60851,I still like it but I wish it had fit.,60851,3
60851,The top strap was much too long as well.,60851,3
60851,I think it one were to cut the strap in the middle to make it one that ties on the fit might be better.,60851,3
60851,"Still, for how much I paid I feel as though I expected this.",60851,3
60852,I bought this for an 8 month old and it doesn't fit.,60852,3
60852,I thought I would get a toddler size so she could grow into it but it doesn't even fit her now.,60852,3
60852,It's very cute and I'll give it to a friend whose expecting soon so she can get use of it.,60852,3
60853,Size ran smaller than expected but I do like the fabric,60853,3
60854,Got a size up and still fit tight,60854,3
60855,I ordered an XS and they were huge.,60855,3
60855,Other than that the material is high quality and the colors are right on.,60855,3
60856,I like the color but it could have been a bit more about around the waist.,60856,3
60858,"I like the dress, it is just not a true to size XL.",60858,3
60858,I am a size 14 and XL covers sizes 14 & 16.,60858,3
60859,I was hoping it would be wider.,60859,3
60859,I don't think this material would wash well either very likely to shrink.,60859,3
60860,"I loved everything about the look of this suit except the cups were a bit too heavily padded, and it was just...too...small",60860,3
60862,Polyester is too hot for Florida.,60862,3
60862,Rayon or cotton would be great.,60862,3
60863,"Way to small, ordered an xl, fits my 18 year old daughter that wears a small",60863,3
60864,I loved it but it was too small.,60864,3
60864,I ordered a small and that is my usual size in bathing suits.,60864,3
60865,It's very cute but way smaller than normal sizing.,60865,3
60866,Cute but snug for a L. I gave it to my younger 16 year old cousin.,60866,3
60867,"Its a beautiful dress, just a little bit on the smaller size.",60867,3
60868,Nice Design but was small in between my legs,60868,3
60870,I purchased this in royal blue first in a medium.,60870,3
60870,"I fitted too snug so I purchased it in black, only this time I bought a large.",60870,3
60870,"When I tell you, it fit the exact same way the medium did.",60870,3
60870,"I really like this jumpsuit in blue, but I'm scared to get an extra large, it might be too small.",60870,3
60871,I love this dress & i get compliments on it every time i wear it!,60871,3
60871,"I am 5""7 & 130 pounds and I got a small.",60871,3
60871,"I do have to warn you that it is pretty short, especially in the back!",60871,3
60871,"But overall, i love this dress",60871,3
60872,"These are a very very lightweight material, so if you were thinking to camouflage some waist fat (which I was) they do cling some, depending on what you are wearing them with.",60872,3
60872,They have to be handwashed and can't use the drier... that is the mark-down.,60872,3
60873,I like the style and how it was made but didn't like that an xxlarge is way to small,60873,3
60874,The wig looked great only downside was that it sheds at lot.,60874,3
60874,You have ever to be very careful when touching it!,60874,3
60874,But it served it purpose for the party!,60874,3
60876,I ordered this as a gift.,60876,3
60876,The recipient loved it and it came in a cute box.,60876,3
60876,Shipping took longer than expected(almost a week),60876,3
60878,Does not hold the charge as indicated,60878,3
60879,cute but looks fake.,60879,3
60881,"While these are comfortable and fit nicely, they stretch out.",60881,3
60881,The clips hold very nicely though and are easy to use one-handed.,60881,3
60881,My biggest complain though is the removable pads.,60881,3
60881,"They are foam and have a silky covering over them, but the covering came off in the wash after only a few washes.",60881,3
60881,"Also, you cannot wear these under fitted shirts because the pads are extremely visable, leaving you with two circles on your breasts that may or may not be in the same place on each side.",60881,3
60881,"I wear them at home without the pads and if I have to wear them in public, I slip in my disposable pads.",60881,3
60882,I was surprised it was too small because I ordered a large and the material was not giving.,60882,3
60882,I normally order medium or large  for a better fit.,60882,3
60882,Last time I ordered large from the site it was too large so this time I ordered both & both did not fit.,60882,3
60882,That is the frustration about ordering online.,60882,3
60883,I must say the measurement in this dresses fits as expected so feel free to order your normal size.,60883,3
60883,However I gave this dress a 3 because I felt like the material could have been of a little more higher quality.,60883,3
60883,Don't give me wrong.,60883,3
60883,"Once I true it I an accessorized it, it look lovely but at a first glance an by touch it wasn't very convincing to wear.",60883,3
60883,Once you dress it up the correct way it definitely works.,60883,3
60884,It was pretty but there was a bubble under the glass so the pendant was a little odd...,60884,3
60885,"The writing is so small on the charm, you can not see what it says.",60885,3
60886,This necklace tangle while on my neck with Jay noral movement and I'm having to take it off to straighten it frequently thru the day.,60886,3
60886,"It's very pretty, but it doesn't look good all twisted and tangled.",60886,3
60886,It also took liber to aude than wad told it would take.,60886,3
60887,The style of the dress is cute BUT the material is ugly it makes the dress ugly,60887,3
60888,"I am 5'4"" and 140lbs.",60888,3
60888,I normally order a medium.,60888,3
60888,After reading other reviews I ordered a large and it's still a bit snug.,60888,3
60888,Wish I would have gotten an XL.,60888,3
60888,I haven't washed it yet but I'm sure it's going to shrink a little at which point it will be too small :(.,60888,3
60888,When standing still and taking this photo the sweater looks pretty good but once you move around it bunches up easily in an unflattering way.,60888,3
60888,So you have to constantly keep pulling the sweater down.,60888,3
60888,Perhaps if you order the correct size you may not have this problem.,60888,3
60888,Also the pockets are weirdly way over on the sides instead of in the middle.,60888,3
60888,So if the pockets are puffed out after using them it give you the appearance of being much wider than you are.,60888,3
60889,"Rather than three pairs of uniform 6g plugs, I received onyx and amythyst plugs that are both 6g and true to size but the amythyst flair is much larger than the onyx.",60889,3
60889,The white jade is lovely but is 4g.,60889,3
60889,I saw that other customers have received a similar grab bag of items.,60889,3
60889,If these had been uniform (as pictured) I would have given them 5 stars hands down.,60889,3
60890,"The dress is very pretty, but very thin.",60890,3
60890,"And, it runs small.",60890,3
60890,"I wish it would have worked out, but I will be returning.",60890,3
60891,Like I expected for the price.,60891,3
60892,I think I may have ordered a smaller size than I should have.,60892,3
60892,I don't mind as I am trying to lose weight and hope they will fit fine in a short time.,60892,3
60892,"I won't wear them with the cup pads, though, they don't fit well, they stick out too much and doesn't cover the breast.",60892,3
60893,though I wish it was longer.,60893,3
60894,"Wisth narrower than expected'; otherwise, just fine.",60894,3
60895,It was too large for me so I gave it to my sister who really liked it.,60895,3
60896,These insoles helped in my boots.,60896,3
60896,Not as wide as expected.,60896,3
60896,"While these help, I need an insole with more padding at the ball of my foot.",60896,3
60897,too small and cost too much to ship back,60897,3
60899,I didn't realize the strap covered my ears!,60899,3
60899,I was looking for something light and comfortable which had a small chin strap.,60899,3
60900,don't like it after the first wash,60900,3
60901,"They're cheap compression stockings, you get what you pay for.",60901,3
60901,They do the job but won't last long and will need replacing in a month so I will be buying new ones a little before then.,60901,3
60901,The zipper isn't really an asset as it falls down and you can't zip them up you still have to roll them on like regular compression stocking which is what I'm going to get next time.,60901,3
60902,the bottom is really big -  the open zips def.,60902,3
60902,do not fit the way it shows on the picture.,60902,3
60902,"the top is also a bit bigger, but I could adjust it.",60902,3
60902,I wish I could order the top and bottom sizes separately.,60902,3
60902,I wore it with a different bottom.,60902,3
60903,"Overall nice earrings, but it took quite sometime before I received them.",60903,3
60904,The mask arrived on time and in great condition.,60904,3
60904,"Yes, it was a little warped at the top of the head but was easily fixed with a short application of my heat gun and some caressing to get it to be perfectly round.",60904,3
60904,"Also came with a balaclava, albeit a cheap, thin one.",60904,3
60904,"However, my BIGGEST issue is that the straps on the back are BOTH male ends.",60904,3
60904,As in it will not be possible to buckle it closed in its current state.,60904,3
60904,Think of that scene in Jurassic Park where they're in the helicopter and he's trying to buckle up his seat belt but he only has 2 female ends to work with and ends up just tying them together?,60904,3
60904,"Pretty much what I am working with, only they're male ends.",60904,3
60904,Pretty lame for the amount I paid.,60904,3
60905,Honestly when I bought this shirt I thought it was a simple dhl shirt I had no idea it was an actual brand for vetemens and once I bought the shirt I said oh well hopefully the coloring is right and it wasn't.,60905,3
60905,The shade or yellow is very pale and then red is pale too.,60905,3
60905,Next time I'll do more research.,60905,3
60906,The shirt looked great and very good quality..the size runs way big,60906,3
60907,Embroidery stabilizer not up to par.,60907,3
60908,"The bottoms were fine, but the top was a bit large and didn't fit right.",60908,3
60909,"It fits a it big, not sure what my hat size is though.",60909,3
60909,"My only real complaint would be that the brim is not shaped as shown in the pics (kind of curved downwards), The brim is straight out and flat.........lending it a somewhat goofy smokey bear hat look.",60909,3
60909,Quality is fine and brim is big....so it does it's job sun-wise.,60909,3
60910,Material seems lees quality then the material of the clothes I buy in stores,60910,3
60911,too small in  bust.,60911,3
60911,several months since purchase and still having  problems getting refund.,60911,3
60912,Very pretty printand fabric.,60912,3
60912,Background is navy blue not black.,60912,3
60912,VERY narrow; not a size 18 more like a 14.,60912,3
60913,"Dress for petite...not tall & curvy
 like the material color...texture etc., but I am curvy and tall and would have loved for this dress to reach the knee like the picture.",60913,3
60913,At 5ft 9 inches...long torso.... this only reached the top of my thighs.,60913,3
60913,No possibility of sitting in this.,60913,3
60913,May wear as a top with leggings under.,60913,3
60913,Needed a cool Birthday outfit.,60913,3
60914,"I like the top, however, it's to long.",60914,3
60915,"This is cute & the balls move sufficiently; but, it's really heavy...too heavy for a child under 12 yrs or so.",60915,3
60915,"And, although I should have noticed this, the chain is really long.",60915,3
60915,Not returning it but hope to somehow modify it for my 6-yr-old grandchild.,60915,3
60916,"I am reordering an XS
They fit great!",60916,3
60917,Is too much small.,60917,3
60918,its good for the price but it seams that under armor is a narrow shoe.,60918,3
60918,"my son has two different pairs and both are narrow on him and difficult to get on, even with a size larger then his normal sneaker.",60918,3
60919,"A little long, but it's nice !",60919,3
60920,Very pretty top but ran small.,60920,3
60920,Not a big deal for the price and gave it to my daughter to wear instead.,60920,3
60921,Really cute but kept falling down my leg,60921,3
60922,I ordered it thinking it's skiphop product.,60922,3
60922,"Because my daughter has every skiphop in puppy design, so I purchased it when it was on lightening deal.",60922,3
60922,"I already had original skiphop towel, so I was surprise this one was so thin and different when I opened.",60922,3
60922,This is definitely counterfeit brand name is not skiphop on description.,60922,3
60922,It's a lot thinner and less soft than skiphop but it does its job.,60922,3
60922,They made it so well I didn't even know it was fake.,60922,3
60922,I thought skiphop down graded their quality.,60922,3
60923,Has no stretch whatsoever.,60923,3
60923,Does not fit over my boobs and i usually wear a medium in tops.,60923,3
60923,That is the size i got so i was surprised when it was too small for my chest.,60923,3
60923,:( Cute top for smaller boobs i guess.,60923,3
60923,Hopefully I can adjust it because i would like to wear it.,60923,3
60924,It is little  tight around my bust.,60924,3
60924,And the material is cheap.,60924,3
60924,"But, I will make it work.",60924,3
60924,I will wear this with cute leggings.,60924,3
60925,This only looks good with loosefitting pants because it scrunches my butt up on the sides and makes my butt look really fake.,60925,3
60925,It looks like a chunk is missing out of each side of my butt cheeks.,60925,3
60926,You can tell the dress is cheap.,60926,3
60926,Material is very thin and it does run big.,60926,3
60926,I haven't been able to wear it because it's just too big.,60926,3
60926,This is probably something I'll just resale during our garage sale next week.,60926,3
60926,I give 3 stars because it did arrive sooner than expected and it is a very pretty dress.,60926,3
60926,I would consider repurchasing just not from here.,60926,3
60927,"i really, REALLY wanted to like this swimsuit.",60927,3
60927,unfortunately it was a bit unflattering on me.,60927,3
60927,the copious shirring made me look like a slug or worm.,60927,3
60927,the suit was made of quality swimsuit material and seemed to be well constructed.,60927,3
60927,color was very nice.,60927,3
60928,Heavier material than expected but okay for winter,60928,3
60929,I ordered the x-large of this top  (usually wear X-large or large).,60929,3
60929,"It had a cute fit, though the arms were very tight.",60929,3
60929,"I liked the shape of this dress top, but it was too sheer.",60929,3
60931,Meant for petite and short bodied person.,60931,3
60932,"Wife loved the purse's appearance, size and compartments.",60932,3
60932,"However, after a few days of use, it started falling apart.",60932,3
60932,The gold colored threaded pins that hold the straps to the purse unscrewed themselves and started falling out.,60932,3
60932,They are small enough to easily become lost forever.,60932,3
60932,Had to replace the lost ones with long 3mm set screws.,60932,3
60932,Kind of a hokey solution but it works.,60932,3
60932,"If you get or have this purse, check the pins that hold the strap to the purse.",60932,3
60932,I would recommend removing the pins and using a thread locker on the pins to keep them from coming out.,60932,3
60933,Definitely NOT a midi.,60933,3
60933,I am 5.7 and this hits above my knee.,60933,3
60934,A bit itchy and the wires hung awkwardly,60934,3
60935,Didn't work for me,60935,3
60936,Beautiful but broke within 2 hours of wear,60936,3
60937,"These have a great print that was perfect for wearing to a dr who party, but they are smaller than most leggings the same size & extremely sheer.",60937,3
60937,I ended up wearing them over a plain black pair I had to be able to wear the in public!,60937,3
60938,It's an OK shirt.,60938,3
60938,"The screen-print seems well done and the fit is good, but the shirt is extremely thin.",60938,3
60938,"My three year old won't mind, all he sees is NEMO.",60938,3
60938,I myself would have preferred a thicker material.,60938,3
60939,Nice bag but too large for me.,60939,3
60939,A lot of folks would consider this just right.,60939,3
60940,Style is cute but its not true to size.,60940,3
60940,Fit wayyyyyyy smaller than what the size is suppose to fit like.,60940,3
60941,I have worn Just My Size panties for many years and generally like them.,60941,3
60941,I was excited to see these with a new pretty pattern.,60941,3
60941,One of my criticisms of Just My Size is that the quality and softness of the fabric varies with each order.,60941,3
60941,With these I found the fabric to be thinner and cheaper than usual and the fabric was not soft at all.,60941,3
60941,It is actually quite rough making the panties  uncomfortable to wear.,60941,3
60941,"Who knows, with the Just My Size fabric variability the next order could be fine.",60941,3
60941,The patterns are pretty.,60941,3
60942,Bottoms to small in length.,60942,3
60943,Color and quality is great.,60943,3
60943,"However, this seems a little small for the size and the legs are way too skinny.",60943,3
60944,"great quality, fits a little tight",60944,3
60945,"I was looking for something to wear to work, however, these were too small and more of a casual wear.",60945,3
60945,I returned it and received my refund within three business days.,60945,3
60946,I am going to have to put in extra work for this to look good.,60946,3
60946,"I was under the impression this was fitted, but it's not really.",60946,3
60946,I'm typically a small to extra small.,60946,3
60946,"The dress looks adorable, but it's loose at the arms.",60946,3
60946,I will probably have the tailor tighten them for me.,60946,3
60946,It's also cheaply made.,60946,3
60946,Mine has cotton or some kind of white fluff sticking out at the midriff.,60946,3
60946,I'll have to pluck those out.,60946,3
60946,It has a skatergirl-type of appeal in terms of length.,60946,3
60946,I really like it for that.,60946,3
60946,"Short, but not too short.",60946,3
60947,Does not fit correctly,60947,3
60949,This sweatshirt is really cute and decent quality but it runs really small.,60949,3
60949,I am a size 10 and ordered a large.,60949,3
60949,It was way too tight.,60949,3
60949,Order it larger and you will be satisfied.,60949,3
60950,The sleeves are a completely different material.,60950,3
60950,Couple that with the length being too short.,60950,3
60951,It wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be...and the pockets are in a weird location.,60951,3
60952,Beautiful dress but the extra large was the size of a medium.,60952,3
60952,I gave it to a friend.,60952,3
60953,"Good workout pants, but the stitching makes them a little odd/pull in a weird way.",60953,3
60953,"Overall, not bad, but I won't purchase them again.",60953,3
60953,Much prefer the spalding workout/yoga pants.,60953,3
60953,The design and colors on these are cool though.,60953,3
60954,received ok can not rate this yet due to not using it  for now,60954,3
60955,"I love the bracelet, but, it is very difficult to latch and unlatch.",60955,3
60955,I wish the hook could have been larger.,60955,3
60956,"Both ends screw on/off, so I am worried it will bust off at the gem end.",60956,3
60957,Fabric isn't very soft but great pic.,60957,3
60958,too small for an xl,60958,3
60959,Not good for bigger than an A cup,60959,3
60960,"Its small for my 6 months grand daughter, needs to be stretched out to get it a little bit large to put on her",60960,3
60961,"Got to clasp it back using tweezers to have it on maybe two hours and it wasn't on tight because I was rushing to get ready and broke again, same spot.",60961,3
60961,About to fix it again and make it twist a little tighter and see how that goes.,60961,3
60961,Not sure if it was the post office who did the final packaging but it was ridiculously too large.,60961,3
60963,"Size runs small as described in description
Bought them for my girlfriend but they were to tight for her although they have some stretch to them.",60963,3
60963,I decided to try them out for fun and they were a bit snug for me as well lol,60963,3
60964,"It said plus size XL, and it was still too small.",60964,3
60965,thought it was a cotton material not nylon.,60965,3
60966,I ordered this dress in white for my daughter's Christmas performance.,60966,3
60966,"However, product was not white in color as described.",60966,3
60966,"It was a cream color, not white.",60966,3
60967,It's pretty just a little too big and slides off my shoulders.,60967,3
60969,"I'm 5'1"" and weigh about 140 postpartum.",60969,3
60969,I ordered a small and I should have ordered an XS because this size will be too big in another week and I've only had the band for 2wks.,60969,3
60969,Great support for my back and it did help in flattening my belly but it was very uncomfortable.,60969,3
60969,The band kept rising up and hurting my rib cage.,60969,3
60969,I have big hips and i was constantly adjusting the band because it was riding up and bunching in my back.,60969,3
60969,"If your short, like me, you might consider buying the BFF.",60969,3
60970,Bought several at the same time extra large.,60970,3
60970,"Cute designs, well made but way too short, little fabric and came too small.",60970,3
60970,Maybe for women with smaller frames.,60970,3
60971,Great concept but definitely lacks in quality.,60971,3
60972,Broke in a year so you get what you paid for!,60972,3
60973,"it's more like bar maiden, i ordered a corset and made my own and it turn out way better",60973,3
60974,Great graphic but it runs small and the material is kind of itchy,60974,3
60975,It's so unique and cute and I get compliments on it everywhere I go.,60975,3
60975,"The picture doesn't really do the holographic effect justice, it's more colorful and pretty.",60975,3
60975,"However, the first day I carried it, the holographic piece panels began falling off.",60975,3
60975,"I wore this as a cross body bag, and the pieces on the edge that touched my hip began falling off.",60975,3
60975,"The edges for the other pieces come up as well, as if they aren't adhered properly.",60975,3
60975,"I tried gluing them back, they don't really stay any better that way.",60975,3
60975,Basically its really cute but won't necessarily hold up.,60975,3
60976,Somewhat small somewhat thin but ok for the price,60976,3
60977,"I looks nice has good length, but is small",60977,3
60978,Definitely on the bigger side,60978,3
60980,Beautifully made but I went up several sizes and it still didn't fit.,60980,3
60980,Luckily I'm friends with a seamstress so we were able to get it fixed.,60980,3
60982,Great style; just more like size 11 than 12.,60982,3
60983,the layer under skirt is very staticky.,60983,3
60983,"order large, still small--usually wear us size 4-6.  length is at ankles",60983,3
60984,Pics are too big.,60984,3
60984,Some of them are too detailized so they won't pick up on stamp.,60984,3
60985,Nice in many ways but didn't like not having a zippered closure over credit cards.,60985,3
60985,This just wasn't practicle for me.,60985,3
60986,Shrinks pretty good after one wash.,60986,3
60987,It's a weird elastic feeling it doesn't feel like a normal shirt and its very thin but other than that I love it,60987,3
60988,It was not as distinctive as the picture; gold and silver appear dull and lack luster.,60988,3
60989,big at the top .. and very tight in at the bottom .,60989,3
60989,".very clingy , sizes run about 1 size smaller .. so order one size up ..",60989,3
60990,"Yes, it looks like the photo but it isn't as pretty.",60990,3
60990,"The material is cheap and the neckline is poorly made, but I guess I was expecting too much for the price,",60990,3
60991,We only use cold water wash & it still shrank...,60991,3
60991,Fit well before washing,60991,3
60992,Ordered xl got a waaay small size.,60992,3
60992,"In my eagerness to open the package i ripped the bag so i couldn't send it back, that was my fault, but the wrong size through me off completely.",60992,3
60992,... it was extra small lol.,60992,3
60992,Other than that the print was clear and  looked like the picture,60992,3
60993,The necklace took a long time to arrive and had a little glue on the edge.,60993,3
60993,I've purchased similar items from other vendors without these issues though.,60993,3
60995,So I'm only 5'3 and 110 pounds - a smallish Asian human - and I normally wear small or extra small.,60995,3
60995,But after reading these reviews I got a large.,60995,3
60995,"Even then it rides a teeny bit up my back, so I definitely agree with those who've warned it runs very, very small.",60995,3
60995,"Really, I can't imagine anyone taller/heavier than me doing anything less than an extra large, but I also recognize bodies are different.",60995,3
60995,"Either way, this is adorable, especially for the price.",60995,3
60995,"A note - I'm not sure what compelled me to buy this, since I generally dress more on the conservative/professional side (briefly considered giving this to a smaller, younger, skinnier friend), but I'm dreaming of an upcoming beach vacation.",60995,3
60995,"That said, I'm still a mom of a toddler - and tying this as it's shown in the picture makes the neckline too deep a plunge for my comfort level.",60995,3
60995,"I did discover I can tie it like a wrap around my waist, which brings the neckline up a bit.",60995,3
60996,"For such a low price, this can't be perfect, but it is cute!",60996,3
60996,I just wish it was more true to size!,60996,3
60997,I love this bathing suit is absolutely gorgeous I'm 6 feet tall and it fit perfectly the only thing is that it did not have liner in the chest area.,60997,3
60997,So pretty much I would be able to wear it at a friend's pool or an adults-only Hotel.,60997,3
60997,It's see through without being wet when wet it's absolutely see it through,60997,3
60998,"While I love the color, fabric and beading on this collar it is difficult to wear.",60998,3
60998,"Because of the narrow inside lining, it needs to be pinned in several spots to secure it.",60998,3
60998,It would be a great permanence addition to a sweater.,60998,3
60999,"They are a bit smaller than I envisioned, but very pretty!",60999,3
61000,These were a little large for our newborn's hands.,61000,3
61000,Picture Mickey Mouse gloves on small hands and that's about how they fit proportionally.,61000,3
61000,The velcro seems to wrap around twice almost.,61000,3
61000,"Although really cute, we'll need to wait until she's at least 4 months for these to fit properly without looking really large on her hand.",61000,3
61001,Delivery was fast !,61001,3
61001,I gave this 3 stars because this dress I got is ROSE GOLD and the picture shown is a GOLD dress.,61001,3
61001,Amazon even suggested a shoe to go with the dress but I'm glad I didn't order it because the colors would of been off.,61001,3
61001,Orient irder the show because it's like $ 100 bucks and I had planed on making my own shoe to match the dress.,61001,3
61001,I have attracted pix as well.,61001,3
61001,I'm 5'9 this dress is for shorter people the split on the front is too high.,61001,3
61001,I have no idea how I'm going to sit down with out feeling my like my goodies are on display.,61001,3
61001,I have butt and hips with a small waist.,61001,3
61001,This dress does not cling to your body.,61001,3
61001,It's sequin dress so naturally it's itchy but expected.,61001,3
61001,I was disappointed in the color because I was customizing a heel and clutch to go with it and now I have to do something different.,61001,3
61001,Hopefully this was helpful.,61001,3
61002,"Not a bad looking watch, but band is MUCH deeper pink than pictured.",61002,3
61002,The face is actually nicer looking.,61002,3
61002,My daughter liked the cute saying on the face.,61002,3
61002,Price was reasonable so decided to try it.,61002,3
61002,"The watch is working
well so far, but we only have it for two weeks.",61002,3
61003,"Shipping super quick, packaged nicely but unfortunately had to return.",61003,3
61003,Im 5'3 and weigh 170 so I ordered a size XL.,61003,3
61003,It's too large in the breast area and too short.,61003,3
61003,It's a very unflattering fit.,61003,3
61004,look good on  grandfather not my husband he 46,61004,3
61005,it is not what I expected but ok,61005,3
61006,Not crotchless as specified.,61006,3
61006,The fabric is not as soft as other fishnet stockings I've purchased.,61006,3
61006,It has a cheap crinkly texture.,61006,3
61006,"At 5'7 135lbs, this thing is a tight squeeze.",61006,3
61006,"It'll do, but it is not as nice as the one I already had.",61006,3
61007,The brim is not as stiff as I thought it would be.,61007,3
61007,It is a bit to large but t it is one size fits all.,61007,3
61007,The material is okay.,61007,3
61007,For the price you get what you pay for.,61007,3
61008,Clasp does not close.,61008,3
61008,Must return for perfect one.,61008,3
61010,"It is a cute item, but smaller than described in the size chart.",61010,3
61011,Could be made better.,61011,3
61011,Zipper is very poor quality.,61011,3
61012,"These are so cute and soft, but they shrunk a LOT after I washed them.",61012,3
61012,They're now way too small for my daughter to wear again.,61012,3
61012,Pretty disappointing to only get one wear out of these.,61012,3
61012,"If you're going to buy these, size up!",61012,3
61013,It runs very large.,61013,3
61013,It was also sewn very crooked.,61013,3
61014,"First of all, the moment I got it out of the box and the plastic bag it came in there was a terrible smell like paint.",61014,3
61014,"The fit it fine, but the sheerness and smell made me return it.",61014,3
61015,The fit was not a problem but it is pretty much see through.....,61015,3
61015,Hints the three stars.,61015,3
61015,Maybe it would be a good swimsuit cover up or put a slip under.,61015,3
61015,I ended up giving it to a girl friend because it was cheap enough I wasn't worried about sending it back.,61015,3
61016,"The bottom fit me, but the top was too big",61016,3
61017,MATERIAL IS CLEARLY DIFFERENT THAN WHATS PICTURED FRONT AND BACK NOT LOW CUT LIKE PICTURE FIT OK,61017,3
61018,"Its a great product, if it would fit.",61018,3
61018,My friend wanted this so I ordered it for her.,61018,3
61018,"She ordered a size large that she wanted, buying a medium.",61018,3
61018,"the bottoms fit well, but the top is extremely small.",61018,3
61018,Definitely order at least two sizes up.,61018,3
61019,This product was pretty much as described.,61019,3
61019,"The colors were gorgeous, but the fit was just not right on me, personally.",61019,3
61019,It is also a bit shorter than expected.,61019,3
61019,"I'm 5'4"", which is pretty average and the wrap itself didn't go past my behind...the tassels were pretty long though.",61019,3
61019,However if I were looking for something to cover up with at the beach this might be too short.,61019,3
61019,"Overall not a bad product for the price, just not for me.",61019,3
61020,"The color is not really white, as advertised/titled.",61020,3
61020,The color is more like aluminum (blue toned).,61020,3
61020,Still a pretty decent product for the price.,61020,3
61020,"But if you want a true white gold look, this is not it.",61020,3
61021,The fabric is not great but it looks good.,61021,3
61021,I wouldn't buy another one.,61021,3
61022,"The dress was a smidge different in design than the photo showed, but it is still a pretty dress.",61022,3
61022,Fair to good quality in workmanship.,61022,3
61023,Turns yellow after a short time,61023,3
61025,Cute comfy but maternity clothing- you can't tell.,61025,3
61026,This is a very small pendant & and only about 1.5 inches.,61026,3
61026,It did the trick for a Halloween costume but I wouldn't have given it as a gift.,61026,3
61026,It also arrived in a huge envelope & the pendant was almost bent in half from poor packaging.,61026,3
61027,very cute but a full size too small,61027,3
61028,Like the way it looks.,61028,3
61028,Was happy with belt until it cracked on the outer portion of belt.,61028,3
61028,If not for the belt cracking i would have given this a five star review.,61028,3
61028,Belt bucket is great.,61028,3
61029,They are real ray bans not knock offs,61029,3
61030,"The fit is good, have to order up because they are Chinese sizes, not American.",61030,3
61030,"The colors are not the same as pictured that's why I only gave 3 stars, I will have to find black bottoms to match because the top has no lime green in it at all!",61030,3
61031,Looks prettier in the picture than in person.,61031,3
61031,"It's okay, but not great.",61031,3
61031,I don't like how the sides stick out.,61031,3
61031,"You can't see that in the picture, but they do.",61031,3
61031,"It's plain, but sturdy and heavy-duty.",61031,3
61031,Feels like it will definitely last long.,61031,3
61031,"The only attractive thing about it, is the bow and key chain ornamentation on the front.",61031,3
61031,"Honestly, I'm not in love, but it was inexpensive, and it'll do the job.",61031,3
61031,"It's not as if it's ugly, just not as pretty as pictured.",61031,3
61032,I ordered a XL and thus did not bot size up.,61032,3
61032,The fit is perfect and the elastic straps to do smosh my breasts.,61032,3
61032,The color is nice but seeing as the shirt is rediculacely short I do wish I had bought black rather then green.,61032,3
61032,"Also light blue and green , not the same thing.",61032,3
61032,I am 5.3 and The shirt doesn't even fall below my but and I won't be able to wear it without leggings.,61032,3
61032,I suggest getting a color that looks well with whatever leggings you own.,61032,3
61032,I shall be keeping it though as I can always die the fabric and lengthen it.,61032,3
61035,Abit big but can hold iPhone and keys with lipstick etc so it's worth the price.,61035,3
61036,The wings itself are great!,61036,3
61036,I got many compliments on them at Halloween.,61036,3
61036,"However, the finger loops are minuscule!",61036,3
61036,"I have slim ""piano player"" fingers and I could barely get it on to the middle of my finger, and when I did, it was cutting off the circulation.",61036,3
61036,"I ended up cutting off the loops and tied the tip of the wing to a hair elastic and wore the elastic around my wrist, which actually made it easier to use since I had my hands completely free.",61036,3
61036,If the finger loops were larger I would give this 5 stars.,61036,3
61037,Small than I thought.,61037,3
61038,Cheaply made not the best quality but its alright for the price,61038,3
61040,I do love this necklace.,61040,3
61040,"It's way more gold than it looks in the picture, which was disappointing at first but I've found it compliments almost any outfit and finally I have something to go with the few pairs of gold earrings I own.",61040,3
61040,So it was a happy accident.,61040,3
61041,"the quality is mediocre, it looks ok..but it really wasn't what I expected..I guess  I got what I paid for....",61041,3
61042,wound up ordering other part,61042,3
61043,The prayer Shaw is pretty but it is not in English so I do not know what it says or mean bought as a gift would have returned it but it was too close to Christmas,61043,3
61044,Search out a sizing chart!,61044,3
61046,Not so much for how thin they were.,61046,3
61047,Initially i didn't like this hat tbh.,61047,3
61047,"I bought it intending to wear it backwards like a strapback ,but the size of the hole between the the top and the strap was way to large and it looked akward.",61047,3
61047,"Also the leather or ""pleather"" was overlapping the strap by like half an inch ,so i had to cut it so it was flush with the bottom of the strap which i obviously shouldnt have to do.",61047,3
61047,"I wasn't untill i decided to fold the beak and turn it into a ""golf/kendriclamar"" style hat that i actually started liking it a bit.",61047,3
61047,All in all not a bad purchase but id probly avoid city hunter in the future unfortunatley.,61047,3
61048,"The gems have a nice sparkle, but they are tiny, which doesn't really bother me since I like small stones.",61048,3
61048,"However, from the front, the color of the stone isn't discernible.",61048,3
61048,They are a true 18g and not as irritating as the screw-end nose rings.,61048,3
61048,"They stay in place, even while sleeping, but I wouldn't wear them in a pool or the ocean.",61048,3
61048,Good for office wear.,61048,3
61049,I LOVE THIS HOODIE.,61049,3
61049,"Super comfortable, love deftones, has a unique design on it, nice hoodie to layer with.",61049,3
61049,Definitely want to hang dry this hoodie.,61049,3
61049,I've had it for a little while now but it's already made it into the dryer accidentally and boy did it shrink noticeably.,61049,3
61049,"Probably should mention that it comes in the mail somewhere between a medium and a large, of course I'm also stupid tall so it might fit someone who's under 6' better.",61049,3
61049,"Either way, hang dry it and it shouldn't shrink too much.",61049,3
61049,Just don't spill/drip/drop any food/drink on it and you should be fine.,61049,3
61049,For $13 it's worth it.,61049,3
61051,Ordered a medium knowing I would receive the large.,61051,3
61051,The straps around the bottoms were still a bit small.,61051,3
61051,"I'm 5'3"" and weigh 115-120 pounds.",61051,3
61051,Hopefully I can eat a little healthier and wear it next summer,61051,3
61052,"Bought these for my brother, his hands were cold and wet after the 2nd run.",61052,3
61052,"He's does't fall much (unlike me) so needless to say, I was pretty disappointed.",61052,3
61052,"fit was great, as expected per the other reviews, probably recommend for day use walking around.",61052,3
61053,Was very loose on me and top is weird.,61053,3
61054,Worth what I paid for it.,61054,3
61054,Originally ordered an XL based on the seller's size chart after taking my own measures but it was too big.,61054,3
61054,Slightly disappointed that there was a not an option to do a straight exchange for the size because when I re-ordered it was a couple dollars more than it was when I originally bought it.,61054,3
61054,I returned it and ordered a large which is a good fit but it is very hard to zip up as mentioned some of the other reviewed once you get it on and hooked.,61054,3
61054,Not sure why since its not like I feel that its tooo tight or suffocated once it is zipped all the way up.,61054,3
61054,I do know though that part of the problem is that the hooks get the way of the zipper as if they don't sit back far enough.,61054,3
61054,I mostly use this particular waist trainer to work out in and it is pretty uncomfortable when doing so because it bends at an awkward point in stomach that happens to  rest between one of the gaps in between the hooks.,61054,3
61054,This may just be a personally problem for me though.,61054,3
61054,"Otherwise, good material and does the job of holding in and encouraging my abs to sweat more.",61054,3
61055,Wait part has some extra materials.,61055,3
61056,I love how compact this is and that it holds so much.,61056,3
61056,But after a month the strap broke,61056,3
61057,nice but too small in the hips,61057,3
61058,"The top is really cute for the most part, I'm usually an 34 A/B and I got a medium and it fits great.",61058,3
61058,The bottoms are still a little more cheeky than I like since I usually wear a medium bottom but I'll probably still end up wearing them.,61058,3
61058,"One concern since the top is reversible, the solid color side has weird stitching up the middle which almost looks like nipples pointing through and the pads show through which I didn't know until after I wore it.",61058,3
61058,And The pattern side isn't as vibrant as the order picture.,61058,3
61058,I really like how the top fits if it wasn't so oddly made.,61058,3
61059,This dress is absolutely beautiful and sexy!,61059,3
61059,"However, I ended up returning it because it runs too small (i'm a 106 lbs, 5'4) also, its extremely itchy and you cant move much in it.",61059,3
61059,I might get it but in a bigger size?,61059,3
61059,still deciding since it was also itchy,61059,3
61060,It is like I'm wearing a sack.,61060,3
61060,If I were thinner and taller or had more curves i think it would look cute on.,61060,3
61060,The lace design is very cute.,61060,3
61060,It just doesn't fit my body type well.,61060,3
61060,"I'm athletic with a small bust, 5'5"" 34-27-35",61060,3
61061,It is a great dress love it I just should of order a bigger size,61061,3
61062,"Cute shirt, but not a fan of this fabric.",61062,3
61062,It looked and felt cheap so I decided to return it.,61062,3
61063,Beautiful just kind of small,61063,3
61064,Sleeves are a little short.,61064,3
61065,"Pros:
-Very soft
-Nice color
-Very inexpensive

Cons:
-Has bulky seams on the arms and body that make it less comfortable.",61065,3
61065,"-Too short in the torso for me (I am 5'9, and ordered a medium)
-Weird snaps at the  cuffs of sleeves -totally necessary for this style of jacket.",61065,3
61066,the dress fit good however it was a little more bohemian then what I would normally wear.,61066,3
61066,More of a causal dress than work attire,61066,3
61067,"If you have a tiny head, these will have a baggy top.",61067,3
61067,"If you have a normal size head, these will fit like a regular beanie.",61067,3
61070,I'm sure this fits some people well but I'm definitely not one of them.,61070,3
61070,The straps on top should really have adjusters because the cups sit above my breasts.,61070,3
61070,It sucks because the bottoms fit well.,61070,3
61070,"Also, the color isn't a lovely salmon like the picture but more of a highlighter orange.",61070,3
61070,I expected something not so shocking.,61070,3
61071,Not the same material as one so bought fall.,61071,3
61071,"Same name on label, not near as nice and $4.00 more very disappointed.",61071,3
61072,Our 1st pair the velcro strap ripped on day 1 and then we returned with no issues but our 2nd pair had the elastic lacing rip on day 3.,61072,3
61072,She loves the shoes and doesnt want me to return so we are keeping but the quality is a bit disappointing to be honest.,61072,3
61074,"They may be ok for some people, but note that the lens area is very large.",61074,3
61074,"Too big for the person I ordered them for, I'm afraid.",61074,3
61075,"Ordered slate, got grey.",61075,3
61075,But they are as advertised otherwise.,61075,3
61076,"I was super happy about this product but 2 days after putting my brushes in the opening on top, the elastic broke.",61076,3
61077,It was too small for a large.,61077,3
61077,Or extra-large which I ordered.,61077,3
61077,I've already tore two holes in it just by putting them on.,61077,3
61078,the minnie mouse girls short set taht i bought for my daughter fits but the shorts are real cheap looking,61078,3
61079,The color is more of a jaded green verses the emerald green that is pictured.,61079,3
61079,"It still is a nice necklace for the money, but I was really disappointed because the necklace does not look like what is pictured, and I accidentaly ordered two  I have numerous necklaces the color that was sent and would not have ordered the necklace at all if I knew the true color.",61079,3
61079,"They were not worth the effort to send back, so I just gifted them.",61079,3
61080,I like it but my brushes fall out.,61080,3
61081,These gloves don't adjust to your hands very well.,61081,3
61081,Too big outside that you can not handle the things.,61081,3
61082,Awesome hat bit on the small side though,61082,3
61083,This is a really fun onesie but the sizing is all wrong.,61083,3
61083,My boyfriend bought a size large for his mother as a gift and it wouldn't have fit her at all.,61083,3
61083,He ended up wearing it himself to an ugly sweater party and it was still pretty tight on him in the chest area.,61083,3
61083,I don't know how a large woman could possibly fit in this.,61083,3
61084,"It's a nice band, but would only fit someone with XXL hands.",61084,3
61084,"It's huge, definitely not for a student hand.",61084,3
61084,Make the circumference small please!,61084,3
61085,"A bit see-through, but fits nice, and it's comfy.",61085,3
61086,"The front is set back a bit, and the neck could go down further.",61086,3
61087,"not made for curvy girls, but I made it work .",61087,3
61088,Bought for a wedding.,61088,3
61088,Crystals were perfectly attached and frame was smooth.,61088,3
61088,The clasp seemed a bit rough (not cleanly molded) and easily became undone.,61088,3
61088,"I like that it came with 2 sized chains, both which are detachable.",61088,3
61088,"The inside is small, but did fit my iPhone 6 Plus (with case), a small extra slim battery pack, and a few flat items (hotel room key, my ID and a credit card).",61088,3
61088,"Anything else and it would not clasp shut, but that's all I needed.",61088,3
61088,"If the clasp maintained its hold a bit better, would have scored it higher.",61088,3
61088,"If you don't require much, it's a very elegant bag.",61088,3
61088,Just watch the clasp closely.,61088,3
61089,Nothing to rave about.,61089,3
61090,It was very small.,61090,3
61090,I passed it on to my 16 yr old size 0 daughter.,61090,3
61091,"These are a great size, but the stud is a little thick, so you may have to stretch you hole out a little.",61091,3
61092,"Seemed a little on the small side for a large adult, but would be perfect for a kid/teen.",61092,3
61093,I bought them to wear with a costume.,61093,3
61093,They were somewhat small even though I bought the 1X.,61093,3
61093,I wear a size 12 and these barely fit.,61093,3
61093,They were very uncomfortable to wear for just a few hours.,61093,3
61093,I would not have been able to wear them all day.,61093,3
61095,It doesn't have inside liner which will be helpful with kids running around all the time,61095,3
61096,Cute little summer hat.,61096,3
61096,The only problem was it came flattened out.,61096,3
61096,It is made of that paper stuff so I am having a little problem getting the creases out.,61096,3
61096,But it matches my outfit so I am still trying.,61096,3
61096,Also the band was glued above the seam.,61096,3
61097,the vest was made of a very thin material.,61097,3
61098,"The shirt itself is not the softest, but it is very comfortable and fits as expected.",61098,3
61098,"Tt is not baby doll cut, which was perfect for me, but it is definitely still cut for women.",61098,3
61098,"That being said, the 3 stars are due to the design on the shirt.",61098,3
61098,"The silk screening is not quite thick enough, as there is a bit of bleeding of the navy blue through the white silk-screening.",61098,3
61098,"Overall, however, the shirt looks good, it just looks worn and not as new when you get it.",61098,3
61099,"Cute sunglasses, but they peeled shortly after purchasing.",61099,3
61100,Love material just wish it was bigger.,61100,3
61101,Rather disappointed with this hat.,61101,3
61101,"there is a ""skirt"" around the base of the ""hair"" that has no hair on it.",61101,3
61101,"This section is about 2"", and is visible when worn.",61101,3
61101,"The beard doesn't stay up, and buttons that hold it on are too big, making it hard to separate beard from the hat.",61101,3
61101,"I was able to create a new set of button holes by wiggling my finger into the knitted yarn, and so was able to fix the problems with the beard to a small degree.",61101,3
61101,"Having said all that, My son loves it, and enjoys wearing it around... Lots of laughs.",61101,3
61102,"It is very cute but wayyy to short for me at 5' 9""",61102,3
61103,"Warning - RUNS SMALL

Other than that great - My 8 year old is wearing the 10/12 & my 6 year old is wearing and 8",61103,3
61104,"Ordered this in Rose, very pretty color, a deep pink, not too bright.",61104,3
61104,Fabric is thick and has a nice drape.,61104,3
61104,I was worried about the bodice being too low but that was not an issue.,61104,3
61104,"I am 5'4 and 115 pounds usually wearing a size 2 or 4, so I ordered a small in this dress.",61104,3
61104,The dress tag says it is a US size 6.,61104,3
61104,"While there is some stretch to it, the part right under the bust is so narrow that I can see my rib cage poking through the fabric---it is stretched that tight!",61104,3
61104,I think a medium would have been too big.,61104,3
61104,"I don't find the fit very comfortable, but I planned to wear this to an event so will keep it and hope the zipper doesn't break.",61104,3
61104,Will have to wear a belt with it to make the tight part look less noticeable.,61104,3
61104,I am glad I did not order a petticoat to wear with it.,61104,3
61104,The skirt is very full as  is and has a ruffle around the bottom.,61104,3
61105,"If you want room to breathe, order one size up.",61105,3
61106,I bought these in double 0s love them only down side is is that they're not the same length as ones I'm use to but they are true to size plug tho.,61106,3
61106,Will buy from company again.,61106,3
61107,"I'm 5'4"" 120 pounds- fit well in waist but top was a bit too loose over top and looks (if Im not careful) sloppy at times.",61107,3
61107,I've had to have altered-,61107,3
61108,"Height: 5'1, Weight: 120lbs, Size: Medium

I read a review saying that this was best for folks with short torsos and got my petite sized hopes up.",61108,3
61108,"It fit my waist well and covered up what I feel insecure about, but it's a little too long.",61108,3
61108,"That combined with my A cup's inability to hold the top up makes it sag a bit, making the chest lumpy =( It works fine with the straps, so I'll keep it on hand, but it's definitely meant for those taller than 5""2-3 IMO.",61108,3
61108,"Also, the butt is like a DIAPER.",61108,3
61108,"C'mon, a bathing suit has to shape your butt at least a little bit.",61108,3
61108,The granny panty cancels out the crochet sexiness.,61108,3
61109,"This would have been perfect, nut it ran a bitcsmall on me across the bust.",61109,3
61109,"If there was one more size up, i would have gitren that one.",61109,3
61109,The plum is a beautiful dark shade.,61109,3
61109,"Tired of black, so this is a nice alternative.",61109,3
61109,Let me know if there is a larger size at some point!,61109,3
61110,the ring fit prefect and looks good.,61110,3
61111,Very nicely made but had to give it away to someone smaller.,61111,3
61112,It's lovely and made of good material but is nowhere near standard sizing and is very tight around the bust.,61112,3
61112,I usually wear a size 2 but the small size hardly fit me.,61112,3
61113,"Good fabric, ordered large (medium not available), it is some what large.",61113,3
61114,I'll know more after I've washed them a few times .,61114,3
61114,in the washing machine under light load.,61114,3
61114,So far they're comfortable if not a trifle large.,61114,3
61114,I'm not fond of the bright yellow waistband.,61114,3
61115,My only issue is with the band at the top that goes over the knee.,61115,3
61115,It is very tight and not super stretchy like similar socks.,61115,3
61115,"Also, they are thin and the light colors don't go well over tights or leggings which is how I primarily wear over the knee socks to work in the winter.",61115,3
61115,"I am 5'7"", 180 lbs, and usually wear a size 12/L.",61115,3
61116,sizing was off.im a 32 to 33 in natural waist so u purchased size L as what was recommended from the review threads.delivery was on time thou but when i tried it on its somewhat small and took time for it to be worn.so i just returned it and have it refunded instead.it gives me manboobs and back rolls that is still visible on darker shades of shirts.,61116,3
61116,instead i purchase the corset type of this and will see how it works..seems like the quality is ok..ill keep u updated.,61116,3
61117,"It's a very pretty necklace, but they need to update the photos.",61117,3
61117,"In the photos, it appears to be dark blue with antique gold metal.",61117,3
61117,"However, the stones are a bright teal, and the metal is a bright, shiny, tacky fake gold.",61117,3
61117,"A couple of the stones had fallen off, but were still in the package, so easy fix with some hot glue.",61117,3
61117,"It's still pretty, just not as shown.",61117,3
61118,the product is very beautiful and looks exactly like the photo!,61118,3
61118,it is very very well made and affordable.,61118,3
61118,The ONLY downside for me is that the stud is quite large.,61118,3
61118,It works for a helix piercing but its quite in your face.,61118,3
61119,"Ordered this for my newborn niece, and ordered the newborn size, received the 12 month size.",61119,3
61119,"Cute, and durable, but got the wrong size.",61119,3
61120,Cheap but nice colors,61120,3
61121,too heavy as a necklace,61121,3
61123,Everything is fine with the quality but it is smaller than it should be for 12-18 mos.,61123,3
61123,This is being returned and I have ordered the 18-24 mo.,61123,3
61123,size for my grandson.,61123,3
61124,It is really tight on the arms and the stitching is coming undone some.,61124,3
61124,I've only worn it a couple of times.,61124,3
61124,Can't really raise my arms in the shirt and I got a large.,61124,3
61126,not quality I expected for the price paid.,61126,3
61128,Cute little outfit and good quality.,61128,3
61128,I like that the cape is removable.,61128,3
61128,The only thing that I didn't care for was that the leg snaps would pop open with simple actions like sitting or bending leaving my little man with a Super Dress.,61128,3
61128,"As an outfit that will be wore for short periods of time and the parent doesn't mind some re-snapping, it's great.",61128,3
61128,Going to work on something to fix them so he can keep wearing it because the overall quality is pretty good!,61128,3
61129,Runs really small and fabric is thin.,61129,3
61130,"It's wasn't the right infinity necklace, the other one is still nice tho",61130,3
61131,The wool is very hard no real movement in the hat the bow is not attached.,61131,3
61131,It's a little tight and I have a small head.,61131,3
61131,I have one I brought from a store that was thinner so it have more movement(bendable) but it great for the price same review for all colors I purchase except for the royal blue one,61131,3
61132,This is much smaller then expected,61132,3
61133,Very pretty but wrong color.,61133,3
61133,Navy Blue and Tan instead of Black and White.,61133,3
61133,My daughter likes it though so that's the most important thing.,61133,3
61134,They are bigger than I thought they would be.,61134,3
61135,Beautiful embroidery and nice material.,61135,3
61135,"However, the size was huge!",61135,3
61135,It was a size 46!,61135,3
61135,I ordered size small thinking it would be near 36!,61135,3
61135,Im so annoyed especially because it was so beautiful.,61135,3
61135,I can't wear this and will probably be returning this.,61135,3
61136,I am usually an x-small to small in tops but ordered a medium based on the reviews.,61136,3
61136,It fit me (a little tiny bit loosely) but I felt secure and comfortable in it!,61136,3
61136,It also fit my sister (who is quite a bit more chesty than I.,61136,3
61136,"The bottoms, however, were completely transparent once they became wet.",61136,3
61136,Such a shame because the color and fit were great.,61136,3
61137,I bought this for my son hoping it wouldn't be too girlie.,61137,3
61137,It's probably best suited for a boy.,61137,3
61138,Not perfect quality but it fits well.,61138,3
61142,Broke after one use & had to super glue.,61142,3
61144,Will have to take to tailor to stitch.,61144,3
61144,I was not happy with fabric texture which is why I returned.,61144,3
61144,"Pretty colors, but thinnish and rough.",61144,3
61145,I like the jacket.,61145,3
61145,"Keeps me worm and all, but.....the stitching is tarrable.",61145,3
61145,I got it out of the package and their we're lose strings all over and some strings that weren't even cut off.,61145,3
61146,"Nice shirt, I line animal shirts, but this.",61146,3
61146,This is waaayyy too big.,61146,3
61146,"I fit a large perfectly, this one looks like a X large or two X.",61146,3
61146,Order a seize dow .,61146,3
61147,Nice wallet for kids,61147,3
61148,Could of been better,61148,3
61149,Would give 5 stars but disappointed that the skirt is actually really sheer.,61149,3
61150,Very nice product but DEFINITELY not preemie size as advertised.,61150,3
61150,I still kept for when baby got to newborn size and it fit better.,61150,3
61151,"The cut and fit of this dress is nice; however, the material is not.",61151,3
61152,"Very tight= will have to break in/ The top cuts off circulation- not a big deal if your legs are super skinny, but if the calves are bigger, watch out!",61152,3
61153,"Good quality, but to small",61153,3
61154,Seems like it is good quality but the ring stone is a lot huger than I expected and not as pretty as I was expecting either.,61154,3
61154,The huge middle stone just looks cheap looking.,61154,3
61155,It would have been very cute if I could fit it...,61155,3
61157,It is small from the hips,61157,3
61158,"I like it,Cheap but you get what you pay for here.",61158,3
61159,"not the best quality material, but it's comfortable and looks cute",61159,3
61161,"They are not made for girls with curves, which made them keep falling down.",61161,3
61161,But the fabric was very soft and comfortable on my skin.,61161,3
61161,They are nice overall.,61161,3
61162,"It's kinda loose, but I guess I can make it work",61162,3
61163,"Not bad for cheap shoes, but not the most durable.",61163,3
61164,Fit is pretty big.,61164,3
61164,The legs are too wide at the calf and the waist came up to bra level,61164,3
61165,a few loose threads at the toe.,61165,3
61165,"Don't expect to move quickly in these, they are sticky.",61165,3
61166,I HAVE CARRIED IT  VERY  FEW TIMES AND THE TOP IS PEELING OFF AND LOOKS TERRIBLE.,61166,3
61166,"I THINK IT IS REALLY NICE AND PRETTY, BUT NOT SURE IF I CAN CARRY IT ANYMORE.",61166,3
61167,"This is perhaps an unfair crucible for this cheap raincoat, but it doesn't keep me dry here in Portland, OR.",61167,3
61167,"The water eventually soaks straight through all of the material, albeit much slower than normal clothes.",61167,3
61167,"I bought it in garishly bright orange, so I could be seen on the street or on my bicycle.",61167,3
61167,It works great for that purpose.,61167,3
61168,"It is well made, the fit is okay.",61168,3
61169,This is good quality but I ordered it in 3-6 months when I got it it would fit a 12 month old,61169,3
61170,"It is beautiful, but half way through prom the centerpiece fell off because it is only hot glued onto the lace.",61170,3
61171,a little small if you have a chest.,61171,3
61173,"You can tell that this product is pretty cheaply made, it's had threads coming out and is way to tight around the armpits.",61173,3
61173,"It's a very cute dress though, but be ware that it is different then the pictures.",61173,3
61173,It's see through above the bust instead of how the photo of the model depicts it.,61173,3
61174,This is so pretty but not practical for me.,61174,3
61174,It sticks out too much and is uncomfortable when it turns--I just couldn't get it to work for me but it is so pretty :(,61174,3
61175,"This necklace is heavy and good quality metal but the clasp broke the first time I went to try it on...it's a relatively easy fix, but still kinda disappointing.",61175,3
61176,"Made in China, not a tie with any volume, lays very flat.",61176,3
61176,"I my case it is not long enough at 70 inches, so I will keep on looking.",61176,3
61176,For the price it's not a real bargain but then where can you get a 70 inch tie?,61176,3
61178,"Beutiful, the bows fell off after one day of play, the fit is a bit snug left a small blister on my daughters ankle.",61178,3
61178,"Rule of thumb is to get rain boots a size bigger than needed, for these try two sizes.",61178,3
61179,i would want even warmer socks.,61179,3
61180,"Very cute top, nothing wrong with it however I wish that it was longer or a bit more lose.",61180,3
61180,"I normally wear small or xsmall, I bought a medium and its too tight for a medium.",61180,3
61180,"I love the lace and quality is nice, just doesn't fit well unfortunately :(",61180,3
61181,Took F O R E V E R to get here.,61181,3
61181,Be careful of the sizes as Asian sizes run small.,61181,3
61182,"This was too tight for my taste, however it is a nice dress.",61182,3
61183,Slippers did not hold up for more than 2 days they are falling apart already...hopefully the robe is made a little better.,61183,3
61183,It fits as states and my loves it.....for the quality I think the price is a little high.,61183,3
61184,it was for my hard to please nephew,61184,3
61185,"Beautiful feathers, but when they arrived there was a whole section about a centimeter long of one of the feathers missing like it was cut out :( For the price not bad though, I'm still going to wear them.",61185,3
61185,I just wish the one side didn't have a missing chunk.,61185,3
61186,I'm not sure these are actually made of leather.,61186,3
61186,"I have a pair of tan ones that definitely are leather, and it *says* these are too, but there's no give to them!",61186,3
61186,I realized they might be faux when they didn't stretch at all.,61186,3
61186,"I love the look, so I'm keeping them, but I'm disappointed that they aren't as comfortable as my other pair.",61186,3
61187,"Ordered via Prime, not measurements (no time).",61187,3
61187,"I'm 5'10""... and either need to hem it or wear heels... appliques were a Hodge podge.",61187,3
61188,"The chain is much thicker than pictured, it's not as delicate as the picture, so it doesn't look very feminine.",61188,3
61188,And the pearl is obviously plastic.,61188,3
61188,"From far away it doens't look bad, but up close you can tell the quality.",61188,3
61188,But what do you expect from such a cheap item?,61188,3
61189,"The dress is cute, too short.",61189,3
61189,gave to my daughter she seems to like it.,61189,3
61189,would not order again,61189,3
61190,The size was smaller fit then what was normal but that's ok I really like it,61190,3
61191,It is just way too big.,61191,3
61191,"It is a little see-through, but I don't mind it's only for a baby so for the price I think it is good for an outfit that you use only one time.",61191,3
61191,The picture is of my 8 pound son Wearing the 0 to 3 months size.,61191,3
61193,The coat is awesome.,61193,3
61193,"I went a size bigger because of China sizes, but it still doesn't account for boobs.",61193,3
61193,Everywhere else fits great.,61193,3
61193,It does not fit in the chest.,61193,3
61195,It's really pretty just has a weird fit.,61195,3
61196,"Runs small, wish it had two pockets instead of just one.",61196,3
61196,Product came quickly and matched with expectations,61196,3
61197,actually a cheaply made hat,61197,3
61200,"Cute skirt, but I was looking for a little more stretch.",61200,3
61201,The chain that holds up the suit does not hold-you're going to have to replace it the first time you sneeze or bend over.,61201,3
61201,"That said, the suit itself fits well and is super cute.",61201,3
61201,I replaced the chain with an extra bathing suit strap and it was fine.,61201,3
61202,Does NOT fit newborn.,61202,3
61202,"At least, not if they are 7lbs.",61202,3
61202,They are cute for the most part.,61202,3
61202,Disappointed that it will be awhile before she can use them.,61202,3
61203,"Nice and soft, but mine isn't as pretty as the picture.",61203,3
61203,It's too tight across the bust for me.,61203,3
61203,I needed a size bigger than usual.,61203,3
61203,I gave it to my tall 9 year old to wear as a nightgown.,61203,3
61203,"While loose across the chest for her, she likes it.",61203,3
61204,For the price it's a pretty ring.,61204,3
61204,but it is not a comfort band.,61204,3
61204,It isn't completely squared edges but it is not a comfort band.,61204,3
61204,"It is a little big but fits well enough and you can feel the stone on the inside of the ring, it's not I comfortable but you can feel it there",61204,3
61205,"Cute, but runs big!",61205,3
61206,I gave it three star because the dress arrived today and there was a hole in the arm area butts the dress itself is really pretty.,61206,3
61206,I wish it had the option to share a picture,61206,3
61207,I liked the dress put with some boots it's cute,61207,3
61209,"Not the best quality and runs small, but it's pretty cute.",61209,3
61209,- bit over priced if you ask me.,61209,3
61210,Didn't love this blouse.,61210,3
61210,Was told ran small so at least size was right.,61210,3
61210,Seemes cheap and had funny smell.,61210,3
61211,It's OK. A little short... a little tight (based on the size chart) but it was for an event and I didn't have time to exchange it.,61211,3
61212,I just got this today.,61212,3
61212,"For the price, I can't complain.",61212,3
61212,I lost a lot of weight due illness and I need things that fit small.,61212,3
61212,"The fabric reminds me of lack of a better example a doll dress, you know....cheap rayon.",61212,3
61212,"However the colors are nice and it was a small fit , which works for me.",61212,3
61212,"It doesn't look cheap, but the fabric is., again I  can't complain for what I paid.",61212,3
61212,It will serve it's purpose as a summer dress.,61212,3
61212,"Just understand the sizes rns SMALL , I had to take my wife off and struggle to get it off...lol.",61212,3
61212,"Agan, for what I paid it'll do the job",61212,3
61213,Fits a little to small... By small I mean its not very long at all so I'm glad I listened to the reviews and got 2 sizes bigger.,61213,3
61213,Its really cute though!,61213,3
61214,Son has wide feet and these feel too tight / narrow,61214,3
61215,Nice shoe overall but kept falling down my leg,61215,3
61216,"The elbow patch was a cheap material, returned item",61216,3
61217,A simple bracelet; plain and unadorned.,61217,3
61217,I like the curve and shine to the bracelet.,61217,3
61217,"The bracelet is heavier than plastic but does not have the same weight or heft as a solid metal bangle, but it feels cold.",61217,3
61217,"I don't think the material is supposed to be flexible (and I did not want to risk breaking it), I had to push the bracelet up on my arm until it stayed; otherwise with the asymmetrical shape the bracelet lays awkwardly on my wrist bone.",61217,3
61217,I did not find the bracelet that comfortable; maybe flex or a little curve to the edge closest to the skin might help.,61217,3
61217,"On the positive side, I have very large (read chunky) wrists, so this bracelet is a great purchase for ""bigger-boned"" women like myself.",61217,3
61217,"I did not have any problems getting the bracelet on, and I usually have a problem with bracelets because of my wide forearms.",61217,3
61217,Bracelet comes in a lovely jewelry pouch.,61217,3
61218,"Very nice and stylish back, however, the material was a little too hard for me.",61218,3
61218,"So, I ended up giving mine to a friend.",61218,3
61218,"I would have rated it higher, except that when I reached out to the vendor to see if they had a different product, I never received a response.",61218,3
61218,"As a disabled American veteran, I found that very insulting.",61218,3
61219,It was almost like a tall size.,61219,3
61219,"The bottom fit perfectly, but I needed to be about 6 inches taller for the bust of the swimsuit to fit.",61219,3
61219,There was not enough adjustment on the straps to make it fit.,61219,3
61219,"Unfortunately, I'll have to return.",61219,3
61219,"I loved the pattern and color, but just can't wear it.",61219,3
61220,I can't get it to sit in place correctly,61220,3
61221,Purchased as gag gift.,61221,3
61221,Turns out it was reasonably liked.,61221,3
61223,I actually love the cross - the quality is great.,61223,3
61223,"The chain itself isn't bad, either.",61223,3
61223,"However, the lobster claw clasp is small, and the end loop it's supposed to hook into isn't much bigger than one of the links in the chain.",61223,3
61223,"Sadly, this isn't pull-over-your-neck length, so it means struggling with the clasp every time.",61223,3
61223,"Such a shame, because the cross is nice.",61223,3
61224,These are comfortable and I like how thin they are without being sheer.,61224,3
61224,BUT even though I got the right size the first time I pulled them on I heard some of the stitches ripping out.,61224,3
61224,There is already a hole in the inside seam of the left leg and I only wore them once.,61224,3
61224,I think the wrong kin d of thread may have been used for these kind of pants.,61224,3
61224,They could nt hold up to any kind of strain.,61224,3
61224,But I got what I paid for.,61224,3
61225,This came with a really funky smell.,61225,3
61225,I washed it and it's somewhat dissipated but I can still smell it.,61225,3
61226,its a bit big for my tast,61226,3
61227,It was way too small in the top and I had to give it to goodwill.,61227,3
61227,They only refunded me 1/2 of what I paid.,61227,3
61227,Luckily it was cheap so that helped.,61227,3
61228,A younger person may fit better in it.,61228,3
61228,But the arms are a bit too tight on me while the body fits well.,61228,3
61229,Some of the stitching is already coming apart.,61229,3
61229,It was already washed once so no chance of a return.,61229,3
61230,"beautiful but not very practice, tooooo small",61230,3
61231,"A little too costly for a T-shirt, but it was what I wanted.",61231,3
61231,"After a couple of washings---cold water, low heat, the shape is not holding up as well as I thought it should for the price.",61231,3
61232,"Bought this to go with my minion Halloween outfit, however, I never end up wearing it.",61232,3
61232,"I am a petite person with a small face but, these goggles were kind of too tight for me.",61232,3
61232,They were not comfortable to wear at all.,61232,3
61232,"With that said, they do seem like very durable goggle that won't break easily so they would be perfect for kids!",61232,3
61233,Quality could have been better.,61233,3
61234,This silk product that costs $23 is a disappointment.,61234,3
61234,It feels very thin and needed to be ironed when I washed it.,61234,3
61234,The other scarf I bought for $6 albeit smaller in size feels thicker and did not need ironing.,61234,3
61235,The buttons on the sleeve cuffs are cheap.,61235,3
61235,"But otherwise, it's a cute dress.",61235,3
61236,It is beautiful and warm.,61236,3
61236,"Not so warm for the severe winters, but can handle the cold very well.",61236,3
61236,"In my case, this year was the first time I have seen snow ever, and while I was playing in it, the glove got really wet, my fingers were freezing.",61236,3
61236,"Moreover, the touch screen stopped working.",61236,3
61236,"So, if you are new to snow like me and intend to play with it, it is better looking for another option.",61236,3
61236,The glove fingers are longer than my fingers.,61236,3
61236,"So if you have a small hand, I do not recommend this one, because your fingers won't reach the touch screen and you will have trouble using the cellphone.",61236,3
61236,"Furthermore, the bow has already fallen.",61236,3
61237,"This dress is adorable, but the sizing is WAY TOO SMALL!!",61237,3
61237,Especially in the Hip/Booty area!!,61237,3
61237,Order AT LEAST 2 SIZES UP!!,61237,3
61237,"My Measurements:  5' 5"" and 120lbs.",61237,3
61237,"I usually order a small , so I sized up to a medium at it is too small in the but and hip area.",61237,3
61237,It is made to hug your but like a glove.,61237,3
61237,"With this material being what it is, it shows every single ""dimple"" you may have.",61237,3
61237,"It is adorable, but just weird in fit...",61237,3
61238,strings wear a bit too flimsy and fiddly.,61238,3
61238,difficult to get on and tighten  but once on felt good,61238,3
61239,the helmet is nice but the adjustable head band is cheap,61239,3
61241,Not as gorgeous as it looks in the picture,61241,3
61242,"Cute and flattering dress,  fits as expected but the material is definitely thin and see thru.",61242,3
61242,I will end up having to wear it over my bikini or as a tunic top not a mini dress.,61242,3
61242,Did shrink just a bit after washing in cold and drying with medium heat.,61242,3
61243,The bag is great for my needs.,61243,3
61243,It has more space than you'd think and it isn't huge.,61243,3
61243,I can fit all sorts of things in it (including a small notepad in the middle section).,61243,3
61243,I use this for work and it is great with all the different compartments.,61243,3
61243,I can separate things and still find everything.,61243,3
61243,The only negative about this bag is the quality of the zippers.,61243,3
61243,The inside zipper broke immediately.,61243,3
61243,I opened it to put something in the compartment and then it didn't close.,61243,3
61243,As it was inside it wasn't a big deal.,61243,3
61243,About half the outside zippers have been sticky since I got the bag but as they worked it wasn't a problem.,61243,3
61243,"Unfortunately, one of the outside zippers just broke.",61243,3
61243,It no longer closes.,61243,3
61243,I now have to look for another bag.,61243,3
61243,I know the bag was on the cheaper side but 3 months of use is way less time than I was expecting.,61243,3
61243,With the way I use them at work my bags usually last about a year to a year and a half.,61243,3
61244,This has a strange fit.,61244,3
61244,"The length, and the length of the sleeves are plenty long.",61244,3
61244,"However, it is tight, including the sleeves.",61244,3
61244,"I could never wear anything with sleeves under it, which sort of defeats the purpose for me.",61244,3
61244,"When I zip it, it is very tight, I have to pull it together to zip it.",61244,3
61244,"Again, I could not wear anything more than a t-shirt under it.",61244,3
61244,"It is more like a shirt than a light jacket, which is what I was after.",61244,3
61244,"A larger size would not help, because then the length and sleeves would be ridiculously long.",61244,3
61244,"I ordered a medium, I'm 5'3 and about 125 lbs.",61244,3
61244,"It is cute, as a soft little sweater, but it is useless as a spring jacket.",61244,3
61247,I bought this as a gift- the recipient loved it but the size fit a little too small!,61247,3
61249,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous and has the perfect size hearts, so it's not overbearing on your finger, but after 3 days of wearing it, the black plated band is now a copper band.",61249,3
61249,It definitely doesn't look the same with the copper coloring.,61249,3
61250,I ordered again to small but that was my fault.,61250,3
61250,I should remember that the things I order run small.,61250,3
61251,Got this gift for my mother on mother's day.,61251,3
61251,"She loved it, but had to get it tailored for the dress being to long for her size.",61251,3
61252,The shirt is too small.,61252,3
61252,I ordered and I am a 36 C. The skirt is adjustable and perfect.,61252,3
61253,The fabric pills and sheds on everything.,61253,3
61254,I give it a 3 because they look SO FREAKING  COOL!!,61254,3
61254,But they didn't stay on my nips.,61254,3
61256,"Cute if added with other chains, by itself....not somuch.",61256,3
61256,But it's low priced so wasn't expecting a whole lot.,61256,3
61256,I just combined it with other necklaces of different lengths and it worked :),61256,3
61257,The sleeves are a bit snug and material is a tad flimsy.,61257,3
61258,"Despite the fabric being very cheat, it looks very cute on.",61258,3
61259,The shoes are very comfortable.,61259,3
61259,"However, the closure is made of velcro.",61259,3
61259,After about a week the velcro stopped holding.,61259,3
61260,"Love it I'm 5'2"" it hangs right under my but not at my calf as seen in photo",61260,3
61261,The dress is completely different from the pic shown......wasn't what I had expected,61261,3
61262,My wife thought the chains were larger than expected.,61262,3
61262,She will put it to good use for a costume.,61262,3
61263,The blouse is very stylish and lovely.,61263,3
61263,I went a size up but it was still too small.,61263,3
61263,I gave it to my teenage daughter.,61263,3
61263,IT u AR petite don't hesitate to but.,61263,3
61263,The quality is good and looks very nice,61263,3
61265,very difficult to walk in this dress Becaus it's so tiny and it is and to tied around my neck.,61265,3
61265,I can't even pick up something from the for in this dress.,61265,3
61265,Even if I gave my exactly measurements.,61265,3
61265,In general it's beautiful.,61265,3
61265,But I can't really wear it... Because moving is to difficult with this dress.,61265,3
61266,"Pretty, but unfortunately too small.",61266,3
61266,It's kind of hit and miss how various vendors size their products.,61266,3
61266,I was basing sizing off of another panty product I own this size that does fit.,61266,3
61266,Very pretty though for the price.,61266,3
61267,"Wears OK, but I won't be buying any more.",61267,3
61267,I tried about a dozen brands and ended up going with the Calvin Klein stretchable boxer briefs.,61267,3
61268,Material is good comparable to basketball shorts.,61268,3
61268,Fits right as expected.,61268,3
61268,I wear 34-36 which is XL.,61268,3
61268,If you have a muffin top...STOP!!!,61268,3
61268,You will not look good in it.,61268,3
61268,Good for guys with slim  and or medium size body frame.,61268,3
61268,Your Abs will definitely be noticeable because of the low rise pattern.,61268,3
61268,I recommend this pants.,61268,3
61269,I would have given this 5 stars if not for the grease or oil stain in the front.,61269,3
61269,I need it soon and do not have time to return it.,61269,3
61269,"I am going to try to wash it out, but after one wash already it's not looking good.",61269,3
61269,The white is more of an off white or cream color.,61269,3
61269,I ordered it too large as well.,61269,3
61269,Order your true size.,61269,3
61270,The yoga pants fit as expected.,61270,3
61270,They are comfortable and stretch with movement.,61270,3
61271,"The outfit itself is really cute and super sexy, however the eye mask doesn't quite work.",61271,3
61271,"It's not shaped the way it's shown and it's really annoying to wear, however I will definitely wear the outfit but drop the mask.",61271,3
61271,My husband is going to flip!,61271,3
61272,From my 11 yr old who is slim.,61272,3
61272,They were too small even for her.,61272,3
61272,Love the texture and quality.,61272,3
61272,Will reorder a large and update my review once she gets the new ones,61272,3
61274,"material thin, not very high quality but i still like it.",61274,3
61274,"it can't fit my son as yet, it was a bit too big.",61274,3
61274,just going to keep it until it fits,61274,3
61275,I got a medium cuz I wear a 2 or 4 and it is too short and tight.,61275,3
61275,The large is perfect so this item runs very small.,61275,3
61275,Love the material though!,61275,3
61277,"The print is really nice, but it barely fits me so I gave it to my little sister.",61277,3
61278,"Very Short and I am only 4'11""",61278,3
61280,The material is more like a shiny satin which is a little bit weird.,61280,3
61280,It is larger but looked great during my pregnancy :),61280,3
61281,"I really liked this suit, very flattering with one exception.",61281,3
61281,"There is NO chest support so with the Lycra, it makes you flat as a board (unless you have a large chest).",61281,3
61281,Built-in cups are a necessary addition to this suit.,61281,3
61282,"My wife likes the coat; price was right, color was what she wanted, length was perfect, could use more inside pockets; one large enough to carry her pistol.",61282,3
61282,Perhaps you could wait longer than one week to ask for a review or cold weather to begin.,61282,3
61283,"The gray is much darker than pictured- i was expecting a lighter gray, but it's just GRAY.",61283,3
61283,Not a happy color...,61283,3
61285,"Cute belts, but in a ""one size fits all"".",61285,3
61285,I'm an XSmall to small size and am going to have to add some extra notches.,61285,3
61286,I thought it was 100% alpaca.,61286,3
61287,"Loved everything about these, unfortunately they ran much too small for my butt.",61287,3
61287,"They're still wearable, but would look much more cute if they were true to size.",61287,3
61287,The color is exactly as pictured.,61287,3
61288,"Fit great, the stripes on the pants did not match as expected.",61288,3
61289,"Purchased these a while ago, and honestly my opinion on them is, so and so.",61289,3
61289,"Smaller than expected, if your going to get these then be ready to have issues with them taking them off.",61289,3
61289,"Such a pain to try and take them off, simply painful.",61289,3
61289,"Although shipping was right, and order was correct.",61289,3
61290,OKAY FOR THE PRICE.,61290,3
61291,Color wasn't as it is advertised.,61291,3
61291,I returned it for a red one.,61291,3
61292,The hat quality and look are great.,61292,3
61292,It fits well too.,61292,3
61292,Snug but not cutting off circulation.,61292,3
61292,But I have to knock off two stars for the way its shipped.,61292,3
61292,It came in a bag and was sorta flattened.,61292,3
61292,Hats should be shipped in boxes to avoid this.,61292,3
61293,i got a large and im a 36 c and it doesnt even cover the nipples.,61293,3
61293,not bad for $4 but i would order an extra large if you have bigger boobs,61293,3
61294,but it was way too small.,61294,3
61295,It's pretty I just find it a little too long but it's nice looking.,61295,3
61295,"Also, be mindful because of the shape of the stone it can lightly scrape/scratch the area if pressure is applied accidentally and especially directly.",61295,3
61296,The straps were to big fit my mother in law.,61296,3
61297,So beautiful but had to alter and is completely see through... Not sure what to wear it for other than a beach wedding...,61297,3
61297,But is so beautiful!,61297,3
61298,Love the bottoms but the top fits big and lacks support.,61298,3
61298,Tried to pin it to make fit better.,61298,3
61299,"For my late 70""s wife , it is too difficult to put on with the individual toes.",61299,3
61300,"If you can, you will want to order a size larger than you would normally.",61300,3
61300,"I normally wear a medium in underwear, and an Asian large is a little bit small.",61300,3
61300,The coverage in the rear is also a bit strange.,61300,3
61300,"It's sorta halfway between a thong and a brief, which ends up being a bit awkward.",61300,3
61301,shirt a little short torso wise,61301,3
61303,The bottom is not for big butts.,61303,3
61303,but the top fits well for hand sized breasts,61303,3
61304,Nice jacket and comes in many colors but I returned one that was very big and ordered the next size down and it is still somewhat big.,61304,3
61304,"Runs extra large for the size, about 2 sizes too large",61304,3
61305,Thinner material than I was expecting.,61305,3
61305,It is a nice shirt but not as well made as it looks on the website.,61305,3
61305,Also runs a little small.,61305,3
61306,"These ""leg sleeves"" are not tights, but more like a spandex material.",61306,3
61307,This is one size fits all..but for a person that usually wears a small this shirt is too big,61307,3
61308,"Fits well and is comfortable but fabric doesn't breathe during exercise, got very uncomfortable and felt restricted",61308,3
61309,my husband bought this.,61309,3
61309,It does not look like real carbon fiber.,61309,3
61309,The product does not return to its tight shape as advertised after having a lot of cards / bills clamped for a while and will not hold one bill securely as seen on the advertisement pix.,61309,3
61309,"overall, looks and feels like laminated plastic.",61309,3
61309,"He was tempted to break it to see the actual carbon fibers, but decided against it.",61309,3
61309,"Should also consider putting the product label on the interior of the product, as he thought the brand name actually did not add to the overall product design.",61309,3
61310,I loved the color.,61310,3
61310,Bright orange was what I was looking for.,61310,3
61310,But the band is not like most ice watch bands.,61310,3
61310,The watch slides all over my wrist.,61310,3
61311,Really does not look like the picture ..,61311,3
61311,But it's OK for the price paid,61311,3
61314,"It looks cheaply made but I guess you get what you pay for :/
;-;
Other than that it looks good",61314,3
61315,"Kinda scratchy, shoulders are cut oddly, not super flattering, served its need as a long sweater for halloween.",61315,3
61315,(warrior girl costume for a friend),61315,3
61316,"Its good quality, and fit just how I like it.",61316,3
61316,"But its to warm, I get hot and sweaty after wearing it a little bit.",61316,3
61318,Finally got brave and ordered colored panties after MANY years of only white ones.,61318,3
61318,Based on reviews I decided to order one size up.,61318,3
61318,I've been wearing the white JMS forever in the same size.,61318,3
61318,"These, one size up, are too snug for comfort.",61318,3
61319,"Pretty good quallity, came very quickly, but it is a little small.",61319,3
61320,LOVE IT BUT IT RUNS SMALL,61320,3
61321,"Nice but the sleeves are just a little short for me, so the thumb hole doesn't fit comfortably at all times (find myself having to pull the sleeves down).",61321,3
61323,Returned it b/c it was too large.,61323,3
61324,This was a lot shorter on me then I expected it to be by looking at the model and all the photos.,61324,3
61324,"I haven't decided either way whether to keep it and try to stretch it out each time I wash it(come on ladies, we've all done that before; -) or to return it!",61324,3
61324,I really do love the lacey look to the shirt and the color is beautiful.,61324,3
61326,The fabric is clingy so maybe size up if you will be self conscious.,61326,3
61327,Smaller and thinner than expected.,61327,3
61327,Because of this did not wear but once.,61327,3
61328,the lenses is very see through.,61328,3
61328,you can clearly see my eyes through them.,61328,3
61329,Good price for the belt and my husband seems satisfied.,61329,3
61330,This dress had potential.,61330,3
61330,"Really cute and casual, but very very large.",61330,3
61330,I am a curvy girl - large busted and curvy hips and thighs and I was SWIMMING in this.,61330,3
61330,I could have gone with a small or extra small.,61330,3
61331,Love the bracelet but lost it the first time wore it because it would not stay fastened.,61331,3
61332,but Quality was good.,61332,3
61333,"Quality is great, and I would've loved to use it, but it's too small for me.",61333,3
61333,"I'm short and of average-small build, but this item was too small",61333,3
61334,"It fit very well, but it was too long.",61334,3
61334,I bought this shirt for my 6 year old girl.,61334,3
61334,She normally wears size 7/8.,61334,3
61335,The quality is kind of cheap and the waste band makes me itch.,61335,3
61335,First time I've ever experienced that with clothing.,61335,3
61336,"Way smaller than what I envisioned, also the picture above made me expect this to have more room than what I currently have.",61336,3
61336,"I love how soft and silky it is though, so I'm happy to keep it and may perhaps get one more!",61336,3
61338,This picture is very decieving.,61338,3
61338,It first look see they but it is.,61338,3
61338,"I was not planning on wearing for a beach cover up, thought I could wear doing the house.",61338,3
61338,Too sheer for that.,61338,3
61338,"However, I will keep it to wear over my swimsuit on the beach.",61338,3
61339,Again bought a XL made for someone who's alot smaller.,61339,3
61339,Very cute for just too small.,61339,3
61340,"I ordered a Large and I usually am a size 8/10 - 36C, top was good since it was a tie at the neck and back.",61340,3
61340,Bottoms...waist was great but the leg openings are so small!,61340,3
61340,I have a small butt and skinny legs but this thing fit weird.,61340,3
61340,"If they give a few inches I can wear it, but recommend going up a size...but top might be big!",61340,3
61341,Did not fit as expected.,61341,3
61341,It actually flares out more than what is shown in the picture.,61341,3
61341,Had to use velcro to keep it closed more so it wouldn't look so big.,61341,3
61342,it is much more gold and honestly not nearly as cute in person!,61342,3
61342,the fit was quite small and too long,61342,3
61343,"These are cute pajamas, but the neck openings on the tops are much to large.",61343,3
61343,The girls I purchased these for were too embarrassed to wear them in front of the other family members who were in town visiting because they felt immodest.,61343,3
61343,"The pants fit fine, and the sleeves and bodice of the tops were fine, it is just the neck openings that were huge and saggy.",61343,3
61344,"It's cute, but I bought an XL and it fits like a M.",61344,3
61345,"this romper is soo adorable, however the shorts part are wayyy too short
my buttcheeks will show if i raise my arms
other than that i love this romper",61345,3
61346,"Love the concept, but just after one wash the black is fading.",61346,3
61346,I hope this shirt will last for my Disney cruise in November.,61346,3
61346,I do not feel it will last long.,61346,3
61348,more colorful in the picture than life.,61348,3
61348,Took forever to arrive.,61348,3
61349,"My daughter did not hate them, but she did not love them either.",61349,3
61349,"She said they made her arms itch, and as a result, she was not able to usr them for prom.",61349,3
61350,I like the bag.,61350,3
61350,the extra pockets come in handy.,61350,3
61350,It got three stars because the  zippers were broken.,61350,3
61350,Not bad enough to return but certainly annoying.,61350,3
61351,"The tank is cool, but way too small.",61351,3
61351,I ordered an Extra large (and I am typically a large) and it was tight.,61351,3
61351,"The colors were okay, but not as bright as pictured.",61351,3
61351,I thought the tank was a bit pricey for the quality.,61351,3
61351,"I wanted to fall in love with this one, but it missed the mark.",61351,3
61352,Enough Springs for a lifetime,61352,3
61353,Super cute dress but too large.,61353,3
61353,"I was bummed because I was happy with the color, design and fabric.",61353,3
61353,I ordered an XS (size 0-2) and it hung on me.,61353,3
61353,Large in the armpit area and too long.,61353,3
61353,Very happy with the return process on this item and the quickness of getting my refund.,61353,3
61354,There are better ones and a cheaper price.,61354,3
61354,"Bought 4 , all different mfgrs- Levi was the worst.",61354,3
61354,It hurts as I am a loyal Levi customer for the past 70 years.,61354,3
61355,"The item is made of materiel similar to a swimsuit like Polyester, Nylon or blended synthetic fibers.",61355,3
61356,Fits well... Has an ugly stitching on the side.,61356,3
61356,"If it didn't, the shirt would be perfect",61356,3
61357,A little larger than I measured them to fit me.,61357,3
61357,The material isn't sewn together very well.,61357,3
61358,This is a very casual and cool dress.,61358,3
61358,It's cool because it's very thin so be careful where you where this.,61358,3
61358,"Also, the V is much lower than expected so I needed to wear a tank underneath.",61358,3
61359,The ring fits true to size.,61359,3
61359,It is really smoothe.,61359,3
61359,The reason why I gave it three stars is because it is not as pink as the picture shows.,61359,3
61359,It is a very very light pink.,61359,3
61359,More like a baby pink.,61359,3
61359,It is however shiny like a pearl and not dull.,61359,3
61359,The inside of the ring has the word CERAMIC.,61359,3
61359,I thought the ring was just made of ceramic but it is written inside the ring like its the brand of the ring or something.,61359,3
61359,Overall the ring is really pretty.,61359,3
61359,I am a Cancer survivor and thought I'd use the ring as a reminder but I just wish that it could've been more pink like the picture shows :(,61359,3
61360,The ran very small.,61360,3
61361,Got the solid rainbow colors of these.,61361,3
61361,"Cute and good quality however, they carry an odor, even after washing.",61361,3
61361,My husband says they smell like burning mothballs.,61361,3
61362,The lace started getting holes in it immediately.,61362,3
61363,"Socks shrunk after 1 wash
Are now unwearable",61363,3
61364,I really liked the look of this romper.,61364,3
61364,"However, it was so short my cheeks were right there at the hem.",61364,3
61364,A shame as it looks good on.,61364,3
61364,"It's worth a try with prime, can return for free right.. Might work for you.",61364,3
61365,The shorts fit perfectly but the top was a bit too small & the zipper ending up breaking after getting stuck.,61365,3
61366,I ordered it in pink and got a coffee colour.... not complaining too much.,61366,3
61366,I still like it.,61366,3
61366,But I was disappointed when I didn't get the colour I wanted...,61366,3
61367,Very nice but too small.,61367,3
61367,I'm a size 14 and read some reviews about ordering bigger.,61367,3
61367,I ordered a XXL and was still too small.,61367,3
61367,But if you order right it would be very beautiful on.,61367,3
61368,Bought this for my daughter.,61368,3
61368,She's a size 0 and it fit perfect!,61368,3
61369,It's smaller then what the size chart states that it will be.,61369,3
61369,But I can still wear it if I put a lace cami underneath,61369,3
61371,pretty stones but I do not like the way it is adjusted,61371,3
61372,shirt is great but the collar is to close to the neck and this isn't really necessarily a crop top its more a basic tee that rises up at times.,61372,3
61373,"The top was too big and the bottoms were too small, but hey, you get what you paid for.",61373,3
61374,We like the hat a lot but it's a bit too big for our 3 month old baby.,61374,3
61376,"The ring is beautiful, just non-adjustable.",61376,3
61376,Also a little big,61376,3
61377,I bought this one as a backup to more expensive milano extrawig grip.,61377,3
61377,So far not too impressed.,61377,3
61377,The wig moves within minutes unlike with the other band.,61377,3
61377,I haven't been brave enough to wear it longer than an hour before switching back.,61377,3
61377,Maybe trying different adjustments will help.,61377,3
61377,But so far........they company seems great as they reached out for a review.,61377,3
61378,The material is nice and the collar lays well but it is way too long in the back for me.,61378,3
61378,I tied it in front and buried the back tail.,61378,3
61378,"If you are looking to completely cover your fanny, this is the shirt for you!",61378,3
61379,little too bright for me,61379,3
61380,I have bigger legs/thighs so It didn't fit well there and I am a little bit above average in height so it's not the best fit.,61380,3
61381,Runs way too small in wa are,61381,3
61382,"The dress itself is cute but, I am hippie so it was tight and short for my taste",61382,3
61383,I bought this top a long time ago and I still wear it.,61383,3
61383,"Actually, I am wearing it today.",61383,3
61383,"It came with a shear liner, but I cut that out before ever even wearing it.",61383,3
61383,I prefer to wear it with a cute colorful tank underneath.,61383,3
61383,I gave it 3 stars because the print is not as clear as I would like it to be and the colors could be brighter.,61383,3
61384,It ran very small to size!,61384,3
61385,"I'm 5 foot 3 inches, about 175 pounds, and a 40D.",61385,3
61385,"I went with an XXL just to be safe because I was reading on here that it runs smaller, but I didn't expect it to be this small!",61385,3
61385,Fianc loved it though.,61385,3
61385,I got my piece in red.,61385,3
61385,"Love all the details on it, just very small.",61385,3
61385,"It also rips very, VERY easily so be careful.",61385,3
61386,"I ordered a size medium, but was sent a size large which was actually a good thing.",61386,3
61386,"They fit ok, except in the arm/armpit area, there does not seem to be enough room in the armpit and causes chaffing and major discomfort.",61386,3
61386,Other than that they are nice and fit well.,61386,3
61387,DIDNT FIT RIGHT ON MY FACE.,61387,3
61388,"I love the face and it keeps great time, but the band broke after 2 weeks.",61388,3
61389,Too bulky for a woman.,61389,3
61389,Perfect for a man's wrist.,61389,3
61390,are u sure that is bunny?,61390,3
61391,"Top fit fine, bottoms were quite small.",61391,3
61391,Practically like wearing a thong...,61391,3
61392,Nice pattern but way to small.,61392,3
61393,"Ordered a large with my body type being tall, fairly skinny, 34c/d bra size, size 6 bottoms, big butt.",61393,3
61393,"The bottoms fit perfect, but the top was loose.",61393,3
61393,"If you are 36dd that would have fit better for the suit in large, otherwise I would have went with medium for my body type.",61393,3
61393,"The top isn't too bad for my bra size, but I recommend going to a medium",61393,3
61394,Looks much better in the photo.,61394,3
61394,It was missing a stone,61394,3
61395,"very uncomfortable shoes, cause blister after a few hours of walking around",61395,3
61396,Very cute but VERY short and I'm 5 ft 6.,61396,3
61396,Barely covered my butt.,61396,3
61397,Pretty bracelet but it was way too tight!,61397,3
61397,It would only fit a REALLY skinny person or a young teen.,61397,3
61397,Had to return it!,61397,3
61398,I think I might be able to use this for Halloween because it looks more like a Hippie costume than a dress.,61398,3
61399,The pajamas were fine but too small.,61399,3
61399,I ordered a larger size.,61399,3
61400,top wayyy small otherwise a hit at the Halloween party!,61400,3
61401,But the zipper broke the first time I put them on.,61401,3
61402,Though I did have to cut off an extra link to get it to size small enough.,61402,3
61404,"Not sure how to rate, I really liked the style of the blouse.",61404,3
61404,"The blouse is beautiful, can be dressy or dress down depending on the occasion).",61404,3
61404,"I'm normally a Med/Large depending on cut, I ordered an Extra Large and it was too small across the bust.",61404,3
61405,"I love the shirt, but is just a tad small ... despite the listed size supposedly was meant to be bigger ... it fits a tad snug but I prefer my shirts to be a little baggy in the fit itself, however I would purchase again, and would have been prepared to wear it as a fitted t-shirt.",61405,3
61406,The only 16 neck with 32/33 inch sleeve available for a reasonable price.,61406,3
61406,I much slimmer cut that advertised.,61406,3
61407,I like this shirt - it is cute and the quality is nice.,61407,3
61407,I do not love the material though and the neckline is awkward - it is not deep enough maybe?,61407,3
61407,I am not sure what it is but I am not a huge fan of wearing it.,61407,3
61408,"The fit was fine, but the neckline is deeper and rounder than the pic makes it seem, giving it a bit more feminine look.",61408,3
61408,"Gave it to my wife, looks great on her.",61408,3
61409,I was super excited when this went from $40 to $20.,61409,3
61409,"Kind of disappointed, you can see any panty/bra line that you have through the dress.",61409,3
61409,"You can't see through it, but the material just shows every crease and crevice.",61409,3
61409,Guess it's a sleep shirt.,61409,3
61410,"cute coverup, but struck a great deal into what looks like a shirt now.... something to think about before you order....",61410,3
61411,nice color but a little too small in the behind,61411,3
61412,I thought these were really cute but you get what you paid for.,61412,3
61412,One of them were broke when I.opened the package,61412,3
61413,"I suppose they'll make a good pair of glasses for my wife, but they're too small for my face.",61413,3
61413,"Other than that, I ordered silver and received gold, and the metallic accents are actually plastic, but I think they're well constructed and will hold up over time.",61413,3
61415,Just took forever to get it.,61415,3
61416,The glasses were super cute & lite up great!,61416,3
61416,"I wore them to a company party that we had ""in the dark"" and everyone complimented me on them.",61416,3
61416,"The only issue I have is that I only wore the for 4 hours and then for some reason the hinge broke & the glasses were done for the night :( I'm not sure if it was cheaply made, or I just received a bad one out of the batch",61416,3
61417,"Well, I bought this jacket while being drunk with my husband.",61417,3
61417,I however need to lose a little bit more weight to actually wear it because it's too small for me.,61417,3
61418,A really lovely product.,61418,3
61418,The only issue is the jump ring on the heart charm isn't closed all the way.,61418,3
61418,"If you bend over while wearing this necklace, don't be surprised to see it on the floor.",61418,3
61419,"I liked the top piece because it fits well, BUT the bottom piece was waaaayyyyyyy to tight for my booty!!!!!!!!!!",61419,3
61419,It looked super awkard.,61419,3
61419,So I just don't wear the bottom piece.,61419,3
61419,"But the top is cute, just be aware of the tan line you'll get!!",61419,3
61419,I am 5'2 and weigh around 125.,61419,3
61419,"Bra size varies from 36 A to 34 B, and pants size is a 3.",61419,3
61420,"I like the outfit, but I was sad that it was so big.",61420,3
61420,"My baby was 9 lbs at birth, so looking at the size chart and reading the other reviews I decided on this size.",61420,3
61420,"Wish there was a size smaller, but we'll make it work.",61420,3
61421,"Used it as a daith, and it was really cute, but the gem fell out.",61421,3
61422,It's cute but the material was somewhat cheap.,61422,3
61422,"If it had fit perfectly, I'd still have kept it.",61422,3
61422,But the cups were too narrow.,61422,3
61422,They'd probably fit a C cup or smaller only.,61422,3
61422,I didn't realize it would be underwire or else I wouldn't have bought it because it wear DDD.,61422,3
61422,"Make sure you also order up in size because I'd be afraid the cheap fabric would rip easily, especially if pulled tight.",61422,3
61422,"It's definitely for looks, not for swimming.",61422,3
61423,The graphic print is cute and modern.,61423,3
61423,The fit is slightly tapered on the sides but not at all tight.,61423,3
61423,The rouching on the bottom is flattering.,61423,3
61423,It covers my bigger belly while accentuating my thinner legs.,61423,3
61423,Looks good with leggings and tall boots.,61423,3
61423,It is almost like a dress on me.,61423,3
61423,Got compliments on it the one time I've worn it so far.,61423,3
61423,I do not like the material though.,61423,3
61423,It is a bit scratchy and not very thick like the picture implies.,61423,3
61423,It is loosely woven thin material that looks and feels like it will pill and possibly fall apart after its first wash. We will see.,61423,3
61423,I will wash by hand and hang dry to extend its life.,61423,3
61423,I usually wear a large in something like this as I want it to be roomy.,61423,3
61423,I went with the medium after reading the reviews.,61423,3
61423,I'm glad that I did.,61423,3
61423,A large would have been too big.,61423,3
61423,I fluctuate between 140 and 160 lbs.,61423,3
61423,"I'm on the heavier side right now, and I feel very comfy in it.",61423,3
61423,"I'm 5'5"", thin legs and thighs, thick waist, small chest, very short torso, 31"" in seam, narrow shoulders, rounded booty.",61423,3
61423,This covers the thick parts of my body and flatters the better parts.,61423,3
61423,Would be good for post partum or early pregnancy as it has room for extra stomach.,61423,3
61424,My 14 month old can still pull her earrings off with these backs.,61424,3
61424,They did last longer than others but not 100% I have to check them multiple times a day,61424,3
61425,"Too small, looks sexy.",61425,3
61426,"i was a little disappointed in the fit,  i think it is sized small.",61426,3
61426,I can use it but would not by again,61426,3
61427,"This seems to be a nice enough robe/housecoat, although it is quite see-thru, but for some reason even though it has belt loops it did not come with a belt.",61427,3
61427,"There is an inside tie, which keeps one panel shut, but there is no way to secure the other.",61427,3
61427,"I don't want to send it back, but I don't have a sewing machine and may have to if I can't scrounge a belt.",61427,3
61429,"Great color assortment, but nearly half don't work...they either break after a couple of days use, the balls won't stay on or just don't screw on at all!!",61429,3
61429,"But I guess not bad for the money, considering.......",61429,3
61430,However I'm not a fan of the material as it picks up stuff easily...the sizing was also off,61430,3
61431,"While it's a pretty scarf, it's not exactly what I was expecting.",61431,3
61431,The colour appears saturated and the picture makes it seem bigger than it is.,61431,3
61431,It's a narrow scarf but long.,61431,3
61432,Was okay for a while but the rib started to poke through and became kind of painful.,61432,3
61432,But  it does look nice on.,61432,3
61433,Beautiful product but really too big.,61433,3
61433,Would go one to two sizes smaller!,61433,3
61434,I needed a higher waist band.,61434,3
61434,"This one looks like it goes a couple of inches below the belly button, but mine dropped more like four inches.",61434,3
61434,It was above my C-section scar but not enough to be comfortable swimming in it.,61434,3
61435,I was very excited about this dress.,61435,3
61435,"While its gorgeous, it is see-through, so you have to wear a slip, have it lined or use it as a beach cover-up instead of a sun dress.",61435,3
61436,Winter white not pure white if that is what you are looking for.,61436,3
61436,"Average construction, a little stiff.",61436,3
61437,I submitted custom measurements I had a seamstress take for me.,61437,3
61437,The dress fits like a pillow case.,61437,3
61437,But it is still gorgeous so I'll have to just have it altered.,61437,3
61439,This bathing suit is absolutely beautiful in person and is very comfortable.,61439,3
61439,One imperfection which is actually shown on the model and I did not notice until seeing it in person.,61439,3
61439,The small strap in the middle is actually a little crooked.,61439,3
61439,The bigger your top-half is the better it will look.,61439,3
61439,This product does come with removable padding.,61439,3
61440,This was a great dress for the occasion I needed it for.,61440,3
61440,It fit right over my baby belly.,61440,3
61440,The only thing that was a problem was that it was small in the chest area.,61440,3
61440,Where your chest is supposed to go it was maybe a size to small and I feel like I was pulling it up too often and it was tight against my chest.,61440,3
61441,This skirt is ok but not exactly what I expected.,61441,3
61441,"I'm 5'9"" and 175 lbs with wide hips so got size large.",61441,3
61441,The fit is ok - not exactly too small but not flattering.,61441,3
61441,Maybe it's the color - mint green.,61441,3
61441,A darker color might be more flattering.,61441,3
61441,"Also there's a seam down the back (in addition to seams on both sides), which makes it less flowy.",61441,3
61441,Overall I'm not too happy with this skirt and still deciding whether it's worth returning it.,61441,3
61442,"It's a very nice suit, and I love the color but the sizing is way off.",61442,3
61442,"I ordered a 3X, the label said 3X, but it is more like a 16.",61442,3
61442,"I ordered a 22 from another company, and, as you can see from the picture, this one is much smaller.",61442,3
61443,"Very short, the pants, go one sizes up and for the ladies with big butts 2 sizes up my didn't fit :(",61443,3
61444,I'm a size 2 and the small was way tight.,61444,3
61445,I like the style and cut but the fabric is not soft.,61445,3
61446,"Really cute design, the quality of the materials is somewhat cheap.",61446,3
61446,"I'll be keeping it, but you get what you pay for.",61446,3
61447,Didn't like how the pants looked or felt on my child.,61447,3
61447,But it's cute overall.,61447,3
61448,I expected this robe to hit about mid calf.,61448,3
61448,It is shorter and hits above the knee.,61448,3
61448,"Material is soft, but would not have bought it if I knew the length was this short.",61448,3
61449,Although the beading seem is visuable and you can't try and hide it cause of the way the dress is sewed.,61449,3
61449,I'll have to wear this at a dark function lol,61449,3
61450,These were nice but quite a bit too small.,61450,3
61450,My son wears a 1.5 right now so I thought the 32 would work.,61450,3
61450,We reordered the 33.,61450,3
61450,Hopefully they will fit.,61450,3
61451,bag is nice and a good size.,61451,3
61452,I'm an XL in the US and ordered a triple X.,61452,3
61453,For petite girls it would be ok. No breast support.,61453,3
61453,"36D, Large didn't cover it.",61453,3
61454,the glitter just falls too much...I had glitter all over the bathroom floor and car,61454,3
61455,Nice earnings but for adults or maybe for older girls,61455,3
61456,"The belt was useless,not a 42"" belt,more like a 36"" belt.",61456,3
61456,"Love the buckle tho,glad I had a different belt too put it on",61456,3
61457,For X-Large size it looks somewhat tight in the waist.,61457,3
61457,The fabric could be softer.,61457,3
61457,"It is a bit  ""itchy"" (maybe for my skin only).",61457,3
61458,Pendant too big and it's not hypo allergenic.,61458,3
61458,My daughter neck had some rashes.,61458,3
61459,Cute socks but unusual fit.,61459,3
61460,"Never had hard side luggage, Its ok , excepted more .",61460,3
61460,Still scuffed up after one flight.,61460,3
61460,Zipper seems like weak link.,61460,3
61460,It dose roll very well.,61460,3
61461,FONT IS VERY SMALL,61461,3
61462,It's a little smaller than a USA medium.,61462,3
61462,It's a very pretty top but I gave it to my friend who is a little smaller than I am.,61462,3
61463,its a fun pair of underwear.,61463,3
61463,"Fits nice, but not a whole lot of room up front for us bigger guys.",61463,3
61463,Still fun to wear though.,61463,3
61464,It's exactly as pictured.,61464,3
61464,However I think it runs a bit small.,61464,3
61464,And one of the buttons popped off for me trying it on.,61464,3
61466,"Size is ""One size""... which does not give one a very good idea of whether or not a clothing item will fit.",61466,3
61466,To give people an idea of how this fits.,61466,3
61466,It's tight and I'm a 1X USA.,61466,3
61466,S I am disappointed...,61466,3
61466,Otherwise the top is very nice.,61466,3
61467,"Literally, there is no ""pouch"" for what goes on in the front.",61467,3
61467,It's almost as though they were made for women.,61467,3
61467,"And with the seam in the front, you are forced to decide to go to the left, or the right.",61467,3
61467,A little tight around the thigh and I even ordered one size larger because of the reviews stating they run small.,61467,3
61468,"Very cute, but pretty thin & flimsy material.",61468,3
61469,Advertised as Alex and Ani bracelet,61469,3
61470,"Arrived on time,  looks quite nice.",61470,3
61470,Material is of good quality.,61470,3
61471,These were a lot smaller for my sons feet.,61471,3
61471,He couldn't even put them on.,61471,3
61471,But that's what you get when buying on line with out trying them on.,61471,3
61472,Its a hard case wallet has plenty of pockets and card slots  but its not for a small purse i like it,61472,3
61474,The only problem I have is that the sleeves are too short.,61474,3
61474,"I got a size bigger than usual,but I should have gotten 2.",61474,3
61474,"I'm a female and these are men's sizes,so men you may want to definitely get larger than usual sizes for yourselves.",61474,3
61474,Otherwise it's a nice jacket.,61474,3
61474,I haven't worn it in the rain yet so I can't say much about that.,61474,3
61475,"I bought a XXL and it fit small:)
The blouse is exactly like what is displayed.",61475,3
61475,I still love it even though it can't fit.,61475,3
61476,"I like the bag enough to keep it, but was disappointed that the bag is not red.",61476,3
61476,"Judging from the photo, I thought I was purchasing a red bag, but it is called 'Ginger' which is more of a cognac or burnt orange color.",61476,3
61476,It looks nothing like the photo.,61476,3
61476,All in all the quality of the bag is classic Dooney.,61476,3
61477,"runs big but since it's a coat, it is ok if it's a little big",61477,3
61478,A bit on the cheap side but you get what you pay for...Still cute though :),61478,3
61480,Nice print but fabric is waaaaaay too thin.,61480,3
61481,Heart and ring are bigger than expected.,61481,3
61483,I ordered a GREEN one and got a black and white one.,61483,3
61483,"Very nice material, we'll constructed.",61483,3
61483,Only disappointment is the color,61483,3
61484,The fit of this is very weird.,61484,3
61484,"I'm very petite: 5'2',' 105 pounds.",61484,3
61484,I ordered a large based on other reviewer's suggestions and it was the right size.,61484,3
61484,The material was very thin (you'll definitely need a cami or undershirt).,61484,3
61484,"The bottom gets tight from the way it was constructed, so it doesn't have very much ""give.""",61484,3
61484,"Like I said, I'm petite and have small hips but this size large was still TIGHT on my hips...I wouldn't want it any tighter.",61484,3
61484,"Also, the back is secured by a button and circle thing to wrap around it.",61484,3
61484,The button fell off when I flipped the shirt to be inside out.,61484,3
61484,I barely touched it!,61484,3
61484,It is not constructed well at all.,61484,3
61484,I didn't expect perfection because it was so cheap.,61484,3
61484,It may be good to wear under a blazer where it is kind of hidden.,61484,3
61484,The color in the product image does look like the shirt I received.,61484,3
61484,"Overall, you get what you pay for and it's okay overall.",61484,3
61485,Glasses fit very well.,61485,3
61485,Lenses are a bit loose in the frames but the glasses are overall in great condition.,61485,3
61485,Viewing a phone is significantly difficult when wearing these glasses however.,61485,3
61485,Somewhat blurry and discolored.,61485,3
61485,This is not too distracting though and should not be a deal breaker.,61485,3
61486,I love these swatters!,61486,3
61487,"I liked them, but they are a short wear.",61487,3
61487,"2 of them broke, 2 turned green, and i lost 1.",61487,3
61487,"Cute, but not worth the money",61487,3
61488,I love the Dress.,61488,3
61488,The Material is great and it fit just right.,61488,3
61488,However it was much too short.,61488,3
61488,"I wish I could wear this dress, the skirt part wasn't the problem, it was the shirt.",61488,3
61488,Again just much too short.,61488,3
61488,They do not proportion it right for larger sizes.,61488,3
61488,"To be fair I am taller (5'8""), but still it did not even go past my butt.",61488,3
61488,"If you are tiny (/short), definitely a nice dress, but avoid if you are taller.",61488,3
61490,I read the reviews so I bought an XL.,61490,3
61490,"(I'm 5'6 140lbs) It's still a little small, but if I have it unzipped all the way it's more comfortable.",61490,3
61490,The sleeves are just a little to short as well.,61490,3
61490,"the fabric isn't to bad, I would probably buy another one, but even larger.",61490,3
61491,Material is very cheap.,61491,3
61491,Not a sweater but color and shape of it is as shown.,61491,3
61492,"It's a beautiful dress, unfortunately it fit everywhere except the bust, which won't zip remotely.",61492,3
61493,"pretty darn big for a ""newborn"" hat",61493,3
61494,"The dress is ok, not too crazy about the material, but I kept it as it is comfortable.",61494,3
61495,These are quite small and barely fit my ears.,61495,3
61495,"They seem to be good quality, however due to the size and the curve of the potions that go through my ears, they are quite difficult to get on.",61495,3
61495,And I had one come loose and fall off when wearing them.,61495,3
61495,I really like their looks and will continue to try and get them to work.,61495,3
61495,So I'm looking for a method to get them to slide into my holes easier.,61495,3
61496,"My order arrived relatively quickly,and I was overall pleased with my purchase at first.",61496,3
61496,"The only down side was that after about 2 weeks of wearing some of the jewelry,the paint started to fade away.",61496,3
61497,Horrible fitting shirt but the collar is so cute I just cut it off and made into a dickey for my better Oxford lol.,61497,3
61498,The hat is awesome quality just very big for my toddler,61498,3
61499,"Beautiful suit, but the cups are kind of fitted.",61499,3
61499,"If you are bigger chested, looks funny.",61499,3
61499,I'm 38c-d for perspective.,61499,3
61500,Way bigger than a small was expected to be,61500,3
61501,I washed it once and dryed as instructed and the first time I wore it I had two little pinholes in the side.,61501,3
61501,"The shirts I wear cover that, but expected to get more wear before holes in garment.",61501,3
61501,So not sure if I'll purchase more.,61501,3
61503,"Super cute, not great for working out, kept falling down, better for lounging.",61503,3
61504,Was fine but i got xxl still didn't fit my butt,61504,3
61505,Really long for a crew sock,61505,3
61506,"It's very soft to the touch, my only problem is that when I received it, both packages had been cut opened and taped shut again.",61506,3
61506,Not sure if it was from the shipper or USPS.,61506,3
61507,The dress came without the matching headband thus the three star rating.,61507,3
61507,"I am 5' 7"", 150lbs so it is extremely short but the medium fits with room",61507,3
61508,"We used the sizing chart provided, but the product is too large.",61508,3
61508,At least he can grow into it next year.,61508,3
61510,We like it but it's a little small especially on the arm and shoulder.,61510,3
61512,"It looks as pretty as it looks, but it is by no mean correct sizing.",61512,3
61512,"I wear size 8, but tge XL supposed to fit size 10 does not fit.",61512,3
61512,I end up giving this away.,61512,3
61513,Material was too flimsy,61513,3
61514,It's a little longer but that's great for me.,61514,3
61514,The only problem I have is that my arms a big so it's tight around them and a little tight around my shoulders.,61514,3
61515,Very cute but I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews on this Beach Cover-up!,61515,3
61515,"Shipping took at least 6 weeks to receive, then it was too small, and very flimsy.",61515,3
61515,"I usually wear a size small, but the statement about one size fitting all is incorrect.",61515,3
61515,I decided to give it to my granddaughter for Christmas with instructions to hand wash.,61515,3
61515,I'm afraid machine washing would destroy it.,61515,3
61515,"So as they say ""buyer beware""!",61515,3
61516,Not really as expected.,61516,3
61518,not very high quality,61518,3
61519,I loved the fit and quality cotton fab.,61519,3
61519,"I was very pleased with the length, until the first washing.",61519,3
61519,"washed in cold water and dried in moderate heat  I lost about 2"" on the length.",61519,3
61520,Pretty but I wished they came in gold tone too,61520,3
61521,But I'm very sad one of them where broken which was disappointing.,61521,3
61521,But other than that they're wonderful!,61521,3
61521,Especially in the sun they give off a wonderful shine.,61521,3
61522,"While these readers are very handy and convenient to have connected to your mobile phone, they are somewhat flimsy.",61522,3
61522,After about a month of average use the noseguard on one side came off and they are not usuable without it.,61522,3
61524,Sleeves are very long,61524,3
61525,Fabric was too thin for me and didn't like the quality.,61525,3
61526,Didn't look like the same olive color when it arrived.,61526,3
61526,Was a tad large.,61526,3
61526,Had some creases in it that I couldn't ever get to smooth out.,61526,3
61526,Ended up getting rid of it.,61526,3
61527,the shirt was a very fitted cut.,61527,3
61529,The pattern on this scarf doesn't cover the entire thing.,61529,3
61529,"It is also very large, make sure you look closely at the dimensions.",61529,3
61530,Too small (even ordered a size up) and you have to hand wash (It did not say that in the description) Still a nice looking shirt though.,61530,3
61531,The top and middle portion was a little large while the bottom portion was fairly small.,61531,3
61532,This garment was everything that I thought it would be upon purchasing it.,61532,3
61532,The quality and warm factors were off the charts which were great for the cold winter nights.,61532,3
61532,I cannot give it a perfect score because when I went to launder it a major problem occurred.,61532,3
61532,"First, the process that was used was the one I use for very expensive sweaters which are luke warm water along with a non detergent soap when I removed it from the dryer the entire lining of the garment had to turned into a bevy of lint balls.",61532,3
61532,"Upon closer look it was realized that holding the garment up to the light you could not see light through it which before you couldn't, this proved that the lint was in fact, the lining, and if this wasn't enough it was all over everything and couldn't be removed just by your hand you had to use tape and a professional lint remover to try to make any type of progress trying to remove the lint.",61532,3
61532,Pls take note upon this review before you purchase because it is such a great garments but what is greatness if you can't launder or dry clean it.,61532,3
61532,Came with no laundering instructions.,61532,3
61533,Gown beautiful careful of size order larger.,61533,3
61534,I like the arrangement but contrary to the chart you do not need to buy larger.,61534,3
61535,"We loved the print, and the fit was right, but my daughter wishes the material was a bit thicker/fluffier...",61535,3
61536,They were short in the waist..,61536,3
61536,"I was hoping for them to come up to the waist, and they fell below the belly button.",61536,3
61536,"Just don't feel the best, other than that.",61536,3
61537,"Bulky for a bracelet, stones are not set deep but she did like it.",61537,3
61537,She is currently not wearing it on the bracelet since Christmas and it is now end of February.,61537,3
61537,Charm doesn't lock together.,61537,3
61537,Okay for price but if your bracelet is empty you could fill it with this until you get more charms on it...other than that I probably would go with something else mother/daughter.,61537,3
61538,"Odd shape, at least for me.",61538,3
61538,Color of under material doesn't match pink well enough.,61538,3
61539,Ok so always always always check the size chart when ordering clothing from Amazons overseas merchants.,61539,3
61539,I'm a US size M and I ordered this shirt in a XL and it fits nicely.,61539,3
61539,"Pros
-soft material
-for $7 who cares if it took 2 weeks to arrive
-looks exactly as pictured

In the picture you can't tell it's a bit thin and see through but I expected it to be this way and I wanted it to be a bit see through so  I could wear a black sports bra under it and kind of have it show.",61539,3
61539,"Cons
-it puckers a bit around the top seam where the head hole is, oh well it is actually better made than I expected.",61539,3
61539,-had a weird scent when I opened the package but it wasn't anything that lingered after a round in the washer.,61539,3
61539,-it's not very flattering to the figure I work out for :( but I'll still wear it for casual things.,61539,3
61539,"I also wouldn't recommend drying this shirt, I think it would shrink tremendously.",61539,3
61540,Did like the fit very uncomfortable.,61540,3
61541,These are lighter weight jammies that come in a very cute sack package.,61541,3
61541,They make a good gift for your favorite lush friend.,61541,3
61543,This shirt runs small...I ordered a size up and it fits just right after washing.,61543,3
61543,It wrinkles and will need ironing after washing.,61543,3
61544,"This sweater was cute-ish, but swallowed me whole.",61544,3
61544,It definitely does not look like the picture.,61544,3
61544,Couldn't even tell which was the inside vs. the outside.,61544,3
61545,"its not easy to buy clothes to your baby there is always risk of getting the right size
I think one size + would be ok",61545,3
61546,First one was SO BIG!,61546,3
61546,"the 10-12 america size is way too large, got a 8-10, still too large...not only that BUT, the stitches were missing, front of the suit was so unevenly sewn, back straps had missing stitches, side of the suit was also missing stitches.",61546,3
61546,I was trying to replace my miracle suit but I guess there's no way around it.,61546,3
61546,I will have to order another micrasuit again because noting compares to it.,61546,3
61546,"For the design of this suit, a solid 3 stars is fair.",61546,3
61546,I like it and that's why I bought it.,61546,3
61546,Very flattering and sexy for busty ladies.,61546,3
61546,Just the quality of it wasn't even the minimum of a cheap item.,61546,3
61546,I am a sewist and I tend to pay attention to the garment construction.,61546,3
61546,Also this suit has no tummy control but it does feel comfy around the legs and back.,61546,3
61546,"BTW, I am 5,3, 165, size 10 in american standard clothing and DD cup..",61546,3
61548,Pretty happy with this I got a small and I'm a U.S.size 4 and tall.,61548,3
61548,It's light weight denim material and looks nice.,61548,3
61548,My only complaint is the arm holes at armpits are incredibley small.,61548,3
61548,I have thin arms and they cut off my circulation a bit I may have to have it altered.,61548,3
61549,I really like the design and fit of this piece.,61549,3
61549,"However, it arrived with one of the gemstones missing and the shape of the clicker itself is quite crooked, so it's hard to wear without it looking lopsided.",61549,3
61549,Would have given 5 stars if it looked just like the picture.,61549,3
61550,"Casual top, wide neck.",61550,3
61550,"Looks ok once on, good for the price.",61550,3
61551,The bag looks good but the pocket zip broke from first use,61551,3
61552,I ordered this hat two times from this company.,61552,3
61552,The first time the hat was surprisingly good quality.,61552,3
61552,I was so impressed that I went ahead and ordered another one.,61552,3
61552,Unfortunately the second hat was a totally different brand and not near as nice quality wise.,61552,3
61552,The picture looks like the first hat I got.,61552,3
61552,The second hat was a little lighter red and a litter taller in the front.,61552,3
61552,Just beware this company does not stick with the same materials.,61552,3
61552,The embroidery work is the same and it is excellent on both hats.,61552,3
61553,It's a nice piece but I wish opening of the ends of the chain gold cups are up side down.,61553,3
61553,It would look a lot better.,61553,3
61553,Or at least filled!!!,61553,3
61553,Now I hope I can find some kind of filling to fill in the holes.,61553,3
61554,The pins stuck out of the shipping bag - but the pins themselves were fine,61554,3
61555,the delivery was delay but love my chain,61555,3
61556,"I ordered a Medium but the dress is probably for girls, too small for me.",61556,3
61557,Although I do love the bathing suit and it fits alright.,61557,3
61557,"I ordered a large (I am usually a size 8) but the bottoms don't cover as much as I would have hoped, especially in the front!",61557,3
61557,I'll be keeping it anyway since the price is good for what I got,61557,3
61558,"it's beautiful, but a large is quite small.",61558,3
61559,Not really what I had hoped for.....,61559,3
61560,elastic in waist is all twisted,61560,3
61561,"Very good product, but is beatiful.",61561,3
61562,"Decent material, from previous ratings I expected it to be cheaply made, but was pleasantly surprised that it was well made.",61562,3
61562,Size is a little too tight.,61562,3
61563,Awkward cut for a sweater.,61563,3
61563,Looked weird on my husband.,61563,3
61564,exactly what I wanted.,61564,3
61564,The button comes loose though.,61564,3
61567,I picked the size based on the estimate and the shirt came exceedingly too large; at least two sizes.,61567,3
61568,Very clever idea- and so cute!,61568,3
61568,You can match your hair tie to your outfit and put it in the bracelet to make it a fashion statement- so cute!,61568,3
61568,"I am not sure if it's because I have small wrists but if there is no hair tie on the bracelet, it does not stay on, it slides off my wrist through the opening.",61568,3
61568,I've almost lost the bracelet several times.,61568,3
61568,"And the hair tie does not stay on 100%, it can be easily slid off if you rub against something.",61568,3
61568,Super cute and I love the idea but I kind of wish the bracelet were a little bendy so the opening could be made smaller.,61568,3
61568,"That way even if the hair tie slides off, the bracelet will still stay on.",61568,3
61570,"I bought a pair of capri yoga pants small, black, a few months back.",61570,3
61570,Now some of the stitching is unraveling along the waistband.,61570,3
61570,I've only worn them and washed them a handful of times and have not been harsh in their wear.,61570,3
61570,"Otherwise, I am happy with the product.",61570,3
61570,"I delayed returning them, so if it happens to your pair, make sure you return then immediately within the return policy timeline.",61570,3
61571,Fits right good product,61571,3
61572,The price was even great!,61572,3
61572,So why only three stars?,61572,3
61572,"DRY CLEAN ONLY
Who the hell dry cleans their exercise clothes?!",61572,3
61572,"Needless to say, these are not worn very often, and I've been hand washing them (super time consuming) and basically waiting for them to fall apart.",61572,3
61572,Too bad because these had a lot of good stuff going for them.,61572,3
61573,Nice fabric but headband runs a little large.,61573,3
61573,I fear with the stretchy fabric it will be much too big.,61573,3
61574,If I can exchange for xl I'll be happy,61574,3
61575,"I am 5'5, weigh 125.",61575,3
61575,"I always take an 8 in skirts, from any brand.",61575,3
61575,this skirt was tight on me.,61575,3
61575,"not just in the waist, but across  the whole lower torso.",61575,3
61575,to claim that this is one size fits all is absurd.,61575,3
61575,"the fabric is lovely, if a bit thin.",61575,3
61575,"love the style, and am disappointed that I had to return this skirt.",61575,3
61578,I bought this just 2 years ago and it is now faded and the elastic threads are disintegrating in the bum area.,61578,3
61578,The zipper is still good.,61578,3
61578,"I loved the way it fit, but I feel bad that it hasn't held up for more than 50 swims and washes.",61578,3
61579,A little sheer for me.,61579,3
61580,"The shirt comes as shown, nice quality.",61580,3
61580,But it's not a 3x in size.,61580,3
61581,"It's nice, but too short",61581,3
61582,My son is a 3T in shirts and 2T in shorts.,61582,3
61582,I ordered a 4T since pajamas tend to be slim fit.,61582,3
61582,The shirt is tiny.,61582,3
61582,It fits like a 2T.,61582,3
61582,The pants are okay they I don't think they are true to size.,61582,3
61582,This is a cute set but I would suggest ordering up 2 sizes.,61582,3
61583,I always  wanted this bangle .,61583,3
61584,I was able to pair with the iPhone after two attempts.,61584,3
61584,Music sounds ok. A bit of trouble adjusting the earbuds.,61584,3
61584,The microphone is useless.,61584,3
61585,These fit very slim.,61585,3
61585,Not ideal for tiny/short fingers.,61585,3
61585,"They do seem VERY warm, though.",61585,3
61586,"I'm pretty short (5'1"") and I know this is a tunic and expected it to be long, but it was a little longer on me than I would have liked.",61586,3
61586,"Also, I ordered a size bigger than I usually wear which ended up being a good thing because it fit perfectly, so I'd say it runs just a bit small.",61586,3
61586,"The one thing that really bothers me is that there is a seem down the center of the back, but the bottom of the seem doesn't line up with the point on the V of the hem line so it looks weird from the back.",61586,3
61586,"I attached a pic of the off center seem, hopefully you can see it.",61586,3
61587,this shirt is very transparent.,61587,3
61588,"Loved the ease of this dress, the small cutouts are perfect, shrunk a lot though!!",61588,3
61588,Can't wear it for anything but a beach cover up now:/,61588,3
61589,"Would have been great if was actually full ankle length, but it's not.",61589,3
61589,It's only 3/4 length.,61589,3
61590,I normally wear a XXL.,61590,3
61590,"But I know vests need to be a little larger for me, so I ordered a 3XL.",61590,3
61590,It is still a little snug.,61590,3
61591,I didn't get what I ordered.,61591,3
61591,I ordered 6 nice elaborate long colorful bindi packs.,61591,3
61591,4 out of 6 were great even if they weren't quite the same as in the picture.,61591,3
61591,2 packages were dots that i'd never wear and were not in the  description.,61591,3
61592,"I absolutely love these however, in the first week they bent (on their own) I had them in a case of mine and put them on and LOPSIDED :( however they were still packaged fine and hoping I can bend them into fitting perfectly again on my face!",61592,3
61593,This shirt is soft and fits just as expected but the material is really thin and somewhat see-through.,61593,3
61593,I prefer thicker materials that keep their shape better.,61593,3
61595,Very fitted - keeping since I love it & want to someday get my FIT body!,61595,3
61596,"Size and writing is perfect, however this is not white.",61596,3
61596,It's more of a light grey and not what I expected.,61596,3

61597,"Unless you're very thin or a child, this might not work for you",61597,3
61598,"Just received, the wallet does not feel like any kind of quality leather at all, especially for the cost, very disappointed.",61598,3
61598,As everyone else mentioned its extremely hard to retrieve your drivers license from its slot.,61598,3
61598,I had no problems with the snap staying closed as I don't carry loads of stuff.,61598,3
61599,I only wore the pants 2 time and they ripped right in the crotch area.,61599,3
61599,I loved them until the point and than I was upset that i bought the product.,61599,3
61600,"Ordered large and needed medium (6'2"" and 180 lbs)",61600,3
61601,Very nice looking due to its slim line.,61601,3
61601,"However, my husband could not get in 5 cards and some cash.",61601,3
61601,Ordered another brand that was slightly bigger but still slim line and it was perfect.,61601,3
61602,It fits great but was late getting to me.,61602,3
61603,Product ran very small.,61603,3
61603,2XL was similar to 40R.,61603,3
61603,Refund issued extremely quickly.,61603,3
61603,Material was lighter than expected.,61603,3
61604,"The colour was good but the fitting was not
It was too big.",61604,3
61604,A size down would be a better fit.,61604,3
61605,I ordered this product for my teenage son to use in school chorus.,61605,3
61605,Ordered the size listed on the chart that corresponded to his clothing size.,61605,3
61605,The vest was a little snug.,61605,3
61605,He won't be able to use it for very long.,61605,3
61606,I thought the hoodie would be a bit thicker so it's not really what I expected when I received it.,61606,3
61606,Felt I overpaid for such thin material.,61606,3
61606,I may have just misinterpreted what they were selling so I won't say it's terrible.,61606,3
61606,It will work for my daughters halloween costume.,61606,3
61608,Too big for my taste.,61608,3
61609,Too long for my liking - I returned it,61609,3
61610,"It's tight, so I'll have to spend time and money adjusting the elastic and adding a hook and eye closure.",61610,3
61610,It's pretty uncomfortable due to waist tightness.,61610,3
61610,I wear a women's size 4 and ordered a medium.,61610,3
61611,I like it but it doesn't hold my business cards.,61611,3
61611,I like to keep a couple handy just in case but the slots in the wallet are too small.,61611,3
61612,These pajamajeans are comfortable and fit nicely when first putting them on.,61612,3
61612,After a flight to Europe they were way too loose.,61612,3
61612,Beware that they become baggy after sitting for a ten plus hours.,61612,3
61613,"Like most very low priced clothes, this is undersized - can't get this close to look anything like the picture - and I'm not plus-sized.",61613,3
61614,"These gloves are warm, they work well with my touchscreens, and they fit as expected.",61614,3
61614,I only gave three stars because they were already ripped after a month of use.,61614,3
61614,"I really don't think I did anything to rip them, I think it just wore quickly because it ripped between the thumb and pointer finger.",61614,3
61614,The other thing I didn't like is that when I got them wet outside in the snow and it was nearly impossible to get them to dry.,61614,3
61614,I put them in the dryer with all of my snow gear and the gloves just wouldn't dry even after putting them in the dryer for a second round so I couldn't wear them for a while,61614,3
61615,"Cute but boxy dress, wouldnt recommend for girls that have large breasts or hips.",61615,3
61616,Does not fit like shown,61616,3
61617,"I'm 5'7 160, never had a problem with anything I ordered online, ideal shape, ordered a large..",61617,3
61617,"Material was a blend of cotton and polyester, the off the shoulder strap was what really upset me, it had a stretch to it that made it flimsy and not stiff enough to sit on your arm like in the photo.. Maybe if I ordered a smaller size it'd be more fitting and the shoulder part would be more ideal looking but I'm not feelin this dress at all",61617,3
61618,These pajamas run smaller than normal.,61618,3
61618,"I purchased for myself, but because they run small, they didn't fit.",61618,3
61618,I have them as a Christmas gift and my sister loves them.,61618,3
61619,product is beautiful - the problem was that only two sets were received but ordered and paid for three.,61619,3
61620,Nice looking but the back lower part has a rough edge and can scratch your chest.,61620,3
61621,Love the design ran a little big,61621,3
61622,The magnet is not very strong and it can only hold a few dollars,61622,3
61623,"The goggles are OK, but the eyepiece falls off.",61623,3
61623,The radiator clamp is a poor way to hold the eyepiece onto the goggles.,61623,3
61623,Do not buy these with the eyepiece.,61623,3
61624,Loved the dress but the zipper wouldn't zip all the way up.,61624,3
61625,"Not great quality, but my daughter loves the pictures",61625,3
61626,I think this is an Asian xs.,61626,3
61626,Still fits me but wish I knew this I would order a size  bigger.,61626,3
61627,The decals started pealing off at ends in several places,61627,3
61628,"I purchased this for my 2yo son (who is obsessed with Mickey) to use for daycare, since I'm tired of lugging around 3 different bags full of his daily needs.",61628,3
61628,"PROS:  It's definitely better quality and bigger than what I was expecting, especially for the price.",61628,3
61628,"But still small enough for a toddler to wear and carry around all his own stuff, which was my ultimate goal with purchasing this .",61628,3
61628,The stitches and zippers seem to be pretty durable.,61628,3
61628,"CONS: It does have a strong chemical/plastic odor, that I previously read in reviews prior to purchasing, not that worried about it.",61628,3
61628,"My only real complaint with this backpack and why I only gave 3 stars, is that it has dirt-like stains on the side, like it was kicked around on a dirty floor before being shipped.",61628,3
61628,"It's a lot bigger and darker than it looks in the pic, most of it came off after I scrubbed it with a wet wipe.",61628,3
61628,Not that worried about it since I'm sure it will be filthy in no time when it makes it's way to daycare.,61628,3
61628,"Overall, I do recommend this little backpack and lunchbag.",61628,3
61629,Thought it would be thicker,61629,3
61630,I ordered a XXL I usually wear a 12-14 5'5.,61630,3
61630,I was a bit disappointed at the pattern and I feel like the pleats will need to be ironed in.,61630,3
61631,"Little smaller than expected, but did the trick for a costume",61631,3
61632,Zipper broke after wearing 3 times.,61632,3
61633,Would have liked them better if the lace was softer.,61633,3
61635,Darker than it appears and the stone is not properly seated.,61635,3
61636,"WAAAY too small - bought it for my 2 yr old granddaughter, but will have to give it to my 8 month old granddaughter instead.",61636,3
61636,The 8 month old should be able to wear this by about month 11.,61636,3
61636,"Very disappointing, but not worth the hassle to return.",61636,3
61636,Won't order from this vendor again.,61636,3
61637,This fits very strangely.,61637,3
61637,It kind of hangs to one side.,61637,3
61637,It doesn't look like a well made shirt.,61637,3
61637,But it was cheap and I suppose you get what you pay for.,61637,3
61638,I love the coat but it is cut small,61638,3
61639,"Love it but it's not an 8/10 US, long enough but tight every where else.",61639,3
61639,I will try a larger size by exchange but worry about the length?,61639,3
61639,Seller please contact me.,61639,3
61639,Note some reviews mentioned unable to get into but the side zipper is very good.,61639,3
61639,I like the fabric it is machine washable (delicate)!,61639,3
61639,The aqua color is beautiful.,61639,3
61640,"This is cute, but not the best quality.",61640,3
61640,I ordered the black-3.,61640,3
61640,The black one with black and white design arms.,61640,3
61640,"The arms are a spandex/silk like material, and the rest is just a cheap feeling cotton blend I think.",61640,3
61640,"It's cute, but I doubt it will last long.",61640,3
61640,Sizing seems to be right.,61640,3
61640,I ordered xl and it fits the same as other tops I have in juniors size xl.,61640,3
61640,"One other think is in the description it says it has pockets, and maybe some do, but the style I got does not.",61640,3
61641,"Super cute, but for a newborn .",61641,3
61641,Didn't fit 2 mo old that weighs 10 lbs,61641,3
61642,It was very nice,61642,3
61644,For the price this is a great hat to keep the sun off your face.,61644,3
61644,"But, after 4 days of fun in the sun and getting it wet, the hat did break down a bit and lost its shape.",61644,3
61644,You can lay it out and reform it but you really have to treat it carefully.,61644,3
61644,We would order another one if the price is right.,61644,3
61645,Please be aware that this dress is very sheer.,61645,3
61645,You will need to wear something to line underneath or bra and underwear will be completely visible.,61645,3
61646,"I like this watch/ alarm, but the instructions are difficult to navigate",61646,3
61647,Didnt last long before they broke.,61647,3
61648,It runs a little big.,61648,3
61648,I tied the strings around my neck to make a choker so the strings wouldn't be too long.,61648,3
61649,I loved this for the one night I could wear it.,61649,3
61649,"However, after the first wear, it tore.",61649,3
61649,"I wish that the material was better, because it's form fitting and absolutely stunning.",61649,3
61650,I loved this ring!,61650,3
61650,I wore it for a week or so until my engagement ring arrived.,61650,3
61650,"In the week that I wore it, the silver color began to chip off and tarnish, and I lost a stone.",61650,3
61650,I wasn't even doing anything strenuous with the ring.,61650,3
61650,I work a desk job and don't wash my hands more than the average person.,61650,3
61651,I ordered this shirt in a medium because I was unsure of how the shirt  would fit.,61651,3
61651,"I should have gotten the small ,but overall I am satisfied with this shirt",61651,3
61652,I didn't read the color.,61652,3
61652,"In the picture it looks blue, but it's actually grey.",61652,3
61653,It runs a couple sizes small.,61653,3
61653,"I'm 5' 5"" and 125 pounds, and I barely fit into the Large.",61653,3
61653,"Shirt is stretchy, skirt is not.",61653,3
61653,"It's cute, and cheap, but so is the craftsmanship.",61653,3
61653,You get about what you expect.,61653,3
61653,"I wasn't expecting a stellar costume, so I'm not disappointed, but I'm not thrilled with it either.",61653,3
61653,The bow is detachable.,61653,3
61653,Shipping took about a month.,61653,3
61653,"It's a cute costume, but I wouldn't have payed any more than what I did for this.",61653,3
61654,The bangle fits a bit small and in stretching out it almost ruins the shape of it on your arm.,61654,3
61655,Cute but small in the breast area.,61655,3
61656,The dress is just what is pictured.,61656,3
61656,I do suggest that they post where the dress is coming from.,61656,3
61656,"When I ordered it, I didn't know it was coming from China.",61656,3
61656,"Other than that, the dress is great.",61656,3
61657,But the black stained my jean shorts.,61657,3
61657,May have to wash before  wearing.,61657,3
61658,Fits as expected and my only issue is the color of the lettering and the shirt.,61658,3
61658,Dark letters against a dark shirt... it's definitely hard to read.,61658,3
61658,"Might be better if the lettering was white, after all, this is the reason why we buy the shirt.",61658,3
61658,It's different seeing things in person compared to the photo.,61658,3
61658,Still a decent shirt.,61658,3
61659,it is not comfortable.,61659,3
61661,"I have not wore it out yet, because it is not fitting comfortably.",61661,3
61661,It is a little tight at chest and shoulder area.,61661,3
61661,It looks nice and has soft leather.,61661,3
61661,I wear 38D and I ordered Large.,61661,3
61662,But they seem nicely made and the person who has them likes them.,61662,3
61662,But they were probably 4 sizes too small.,61662,3
61663,My husband loved the color but they run a bit small .,61663,3
61664,It was too flexible,61664,3
61665,"For the price its ok
dont expect this to look good or last too much",61665,3
61666,"Cute, but does not fit.",61666,3
61667,Cute clutch but didn't think  the clasp would last.,61667,3
61668,I originally ordered this in a large.,61668,3
61668,"I returned it and ordered a 2XL, which now fits for me.",61668,3
61668,I am 5'2 1/2 and normally wear a size 16.,61668,3
61668,I will order this in more colors now that I know what size to order.,61668,3
61670,I'd get a size up.,61670,3
61671,Its a weird material,61671,3
61672,A little small and very thin.,61672,3
61672,Also a little scratchy.,61672,3
61673,"Looks pretty much like the picture, which is one of the reasons why I'm writing a review.",61673,3
61673,"It fits a bit small (I wear a size 8, so I ordered a large..still fudging it, but not unwearable) and the quality of materials makes me think it will fall apart after a few wearings, but if you're using it for a costume, as I am, it serves its purpose.",61673,3
61674,Good looks and style !,61674,3
61674,After wearing for only a few weeks the belt has begun to bend out of shape and stretched a bit too much.,61674,3
61675,Bought it as a gift,61675,3
61676,"Something is a bit off with the way it fits, even though I have not worn it I kept it.",61676,3
61677,"Not very warm, comfortable, but not worth buying a 2nd pair.",61677,3
61678,No what I was expecting.,61678,3
61678,"I know that it is a good price, but seems like plastic",61678,3
61679,Loved design and fit but material is to thin!,61679,3
61680,"On the balance this shirt is alright, but the wrists and cuffs are just terrible - they're scratchy and unpleasant.",61680,3
61681,a little more shinny then expected,61681,3
61682,The top is really tight and the bottoms don't fit right.,61682,3
61682,"This is not made for people with curves, but for the price I still wore the top and bought a different pair of bottoms for it.",61682,3
61682,Love the design and colors.,61682,3
61683,"Darling style, but I would not call the color scarlet, more of an orange-red tone, but still good.",61683,3
61683,"The heel area is wide, and was especially so on the right shoe; thus, my foot slides forward.",61683,3
61684,I love the jacket but medium size is like small size..:(,61684,3
61685,The top fits very strange and doesn't look right when strapped on my 5 year old.,61685,3
61685,"However, I really only bought this for the mermaid tail, which fits fine.",61685,3
61686,"I'm 5'4 140lbs and the n necklace was too big, i mean way too big for my neck!",61686,3
61686,The bracelet fit though.,61686,3
61686,The set was beautiful but you have to have a fat neck to where it.,61686,3
61687,Based on the size chart i ordered the xxl.,61687,3
61687,But when it arrived it was huuuuggggeee.,61687,3
61687,I had to pay to adjust the size.,61687,3
61687,I usually wear size 14 but i think a large would have fitted me.,61687,3
61687,"The seamstress took off 3"" on both sides.",61687,3
61687,"I am 5'9"" and 200pounds.",61687,3
61687,And still it was toooooooo big,61687,3
61688,Order two sizes larger than needed.,61688,3
61689,This bracelet is pretty but the catch is very tricky.,61689,3
61689,I'm giving it to a young girl and she'll never figure out how to fasten and unfasten it.,61689,3
61690,"Nice design, but runs VERY large.",61690,3
61690,Youth medium is closer to an adult small.,61690,3
61691,my size is 38D and I am 5.4; x-large is too big/wide; large would fit much better.,61691,3
61692,"These are as described, but are not the highest grade titanium.",61692,3
61692,I would personally (as well as my piercer) would not recommend these for nipples due to quality and size.,61692,3
61692,Size 12g is better.,61692,3
61693,I got this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,61693,3
61693,"I loved this shirt,but it's very thin,definitely runs a bit on the smaller side,& it also has slits up the side...way up the side...almost too high.",61693,3
61693,"Not sure if I will wear this much if at all....I wish the slits didn't go so far up,almost to your bra-line...not sure about this one,really...I doubt I'd buy it again at full price.",61693,3
61694,Feels and looks plastic like....kinda embarrassing.,61694,3
61696,This shirt is wayyyyy smaller than you would think.,61696,3
61696,"However,  It stretches out really easily, so it still works for me.",61696,3
61696,Just be aware and order larger than you need if you want a really loose fit.,61696,3
61697,Cute but top is too small.,61697,3
61697,If I go a size up then the bottom won't fit.,61697,3
61698,"Not very soft, not made for someone with larger breasts.",61698,3
61698,Doesn't pull down enough to nurse comfortably.,61698,3
61698,OK as just a nightgown,61698,3
61699,This bracelets are nice.,61699,3
61699,"Haven't worn them yet, but the material is nice.",61699,3
61700,No where in the description did I see that this shirt has to be dry cleaned.,61700,3
61700,I live in a very small town where we have to send dry cleaning out.,61700,3
61700,It takes a long time and is expensive.,61700,3
61700,Pretty bummed about it.,61700,3
61700,The quality and fit are ok.,61700,3
61701,Wish it was put together a little better and I would be willing to pay a higher price.,61701,3
61701,I broke chain several times,61701,3
61702,Size was not true to size.,61702,3
61703,This is an amazing purse!!!,61703,3
61703,"Love, love, love it!!!",61703,3
61703,"So many pockets, very functional, and very cute looking too!",61703,3
61703,I actually am buying more than one of the very same purse because I like it so much.,61703,3
61703,"Only downfall was that when I received the box and opened it, the purse arrived without the crossbody convertible long strap- which makes the convertible aspect of the purse non- existent.",61703,3
61703,I am waiting on a call back from the My Gift Enterprise Company customer service  to remedy the situation.,61703,3
61703,"But even with that small issue, I am STILL in love with the purse!",61703,3
61704,The time it took to receive was as expected.,61704,3
61704,For the price the suit is decent quality but obviously no real support for breasts so if you're looking for that in a suit look elsewhere.,61704,3
61704,"I'm a size large and ordered a large and it fit true to size, it did pinch my thighs some but I have a thicker bottom half than most people my size so I wasn't surprised.",61704,3
61704,Also the way it fits means constantly pushing the straps up your shoulders so the straps don't fall.,61704,3
61704,I think this may have to do with my bust size and may be better for smaller breasted people.,61704,3
61704,"It is low cut in the back so if you have back rolls like me, just know I felt a lil uncomfortable.",61704,3
61704,"Def not for swimming, but I already knew that.",61704,3
61704,The thing is ANY stretch what so ever will cause the heart cut outs to turn into circles.,61704,3
61704,So when I sit and move and contort myself they are just circles.,61704,3
61704,Which I guess is understandable and all.,61704,3
61704,I think that this is definitely going to suit petite thin women.,61704,3
61704,"I am 5'5"" with a short torso and it is a bit ""short"" on me, the top comes down real low.",61704,3
61704,If I move the wrong way my tiddy might fall out type thing.,61704,3
61704,"Anyway, decent price and good item but not happy with how it looks on me personally.",61704,3
61704,Going to keep it because I don't want to hassle with a return.,61704,3
61705,"The pant set fit as expected and  the material is comfortable, my only complaint is the lining of the jacket shed on my shirt immediately, and after washing the pants, the lining began shedding as well.",61705,3
61705,"The pants set lining material could have been made with better material such as, sweat shirt material which do not shed on to your clothing.",61705,3
61706,"I bought a medium I am 130# at 5'3"".",61706,3
61706,The top is prefect however the bottom is made for tiny little bodies like this is definitely a jr.'s product.,61706,3
61707,"Nice shoes, yet I returned them.",61707,3
61707,"As is clearly seen, they are made of canvas material.",61707,3
61707,"Because of the canvas and they were a bit narrow, I returned them.",61707,3
61707,Just couldn't drop $100 for canvas - but that's just me.,61707,3
61708,This is cute but fit alittle tight because it's mostly rayon versus cotton so not very forgiving.,61708,3
61709,My son watched V for Vendetta and wanted the mask.,61709,3
61709,He searched out Amazon and found this mask.,61709,3
61709,It was significantly cheaper than some of the other similar masks.,61709,3
61709,He picked this mask based on the lower price.,61709,3
61709,We use our Amazon Prime account so we received it quick.,61709,3
61709,When it came it was a basic plastic mask.,61709,3
61709,It wasn't the highest quality but it made him happy.,61709,3
61709,He has it hanging on his bedroom wall.,61709,3
61709,"It might not be one of the higher quality, more expensive masks but it still is pretty nice for the price.",61709,3
61710,"Fine quality, but the neck doesn't get small enough.",61710,3
61710,"The zipper is set up to stop the tie from getting too tight, unfortunately it stops a bit too early.",61710,3
61710,"The description says this tie is for ages 3-6, but the neck is much too big for my average size 5 year old.",61710,3
61710,"It is adorable, but due to the poor fit, I returned it.",61710,3
61711,I would not buy it again.,61711,3
61712,product is okay but is it too small (xl),61712,3
61713,Everyone said they were comeing in small so I got a medium.,61713,3
61713,It looks ok. Just not nearly as small as I thought it would be.,61713,3
61713,I would just order the size you are.,61713,3
61714,Does not contain 14 g,61714,3
61715,The watch is absolutely gorgeous.,61715,3
61715,Sadly it's not running.,61715,3
61715,I assume the battery is dead.,61715,3
61716,the top fell off.,61716,3
61716,"came before Christmas, but the top part was extremely fragile.",61716,3
61717,"good item for the price, not terrific quality but who really cares for a carry bag",61717,3
61718,Normal quality for little boy underwear.,61718,3
61718,I didn't receive the pack I picked in the drop down menu.,61718,3
61719,Its very cute but i didn't even get to wear it once when I received it in the mail it was broken and I tried fixing it and nothing worked.,61719,3
61719,I have the clovers hoping to find something else to put them in so I can wear it...,61719,3
61720,I've noticed a pattern of my purchases.,61720,3
61720,Sizes are too small for normal American women!,61720,3
61720,"Color is beautiful, it's an emerald green with hues of blue when the light hits the sequins.",61720,3
61721,"MY GRAND DAUGHTER IS ALWAYS LOSING HER HAT, BUT THIS KEPT HER HAT WITH HER COAT, SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY  IT LOOKED OR FELT WHEN SHE WOULD PUT ON HER HAT.",61721,3
61721,"MIGHT HAVE WORKED BETTER IF IT CAME IN DIFFERENT COLORS THEN SHE WOULDN'T HAVE MIND IT AND A BIT LONGER, SO IT GAVE HER ROOM TO  PUT HER HAT ON",61721,3
61722,I had to send it back and get the next bigger size.,61722,3
61722,"They are very cute though, and came very quickly.",61722,3
61723,I should have believed the other reviews on this item A little smaller and thinner the expected.,61723,3
61723,Nice looking Jacket though.,61723,3
61724,I was really looking forward to wearing this dress but it was WAY too small.,61724,3
61724,"I need to return it, sadly...'...",61724,3
61725,I looked at reviews that said it ran small.,61725,3
61725,i usually wear a small so I got a medium.,61725,3
61725,Medium was too big.,61725,3
61726,It is an absolutely gorgeous dress don't get me wrong but it was too tall for me and the zipper broke the night of formal so i turned the back into a corset on the dress.,61726,3
61726,I recommend taking the zipper out and doing a satin corset back because then you won't have to go through what i did,61726,3
61727,It makes my forehead feel somewhat itchy while wearing it and it's a little more snug than I would have thought it to be.,61727,3
61727,"Not tight, just snug.",61727,3
61727,It also took a while to arrive.,61727,3
61728,"I love this outfit, the only negative thing is that i ordered this outfit in a 3t, i got the vest and pants in 3t, but the long sleeve short was sent as a 5t which is way to big",61728,3
61729,not sized as expected,61729,3
61730,Quality is not so good,61730,3
61731,Didnt like the fabric too silky for me,61731,3
61732,I was not able to wear this for the occasion I bought it for.,61732,3
61732,I bought this for the great reviews and thought I would be saving a lot of money buying this than buying Spanx.,61732,3
61732,"I bought this to wear underneath a body hugging cocktail dress, the material of the dress was a little bit thick but not 100% spandex.",61732,3
61732,I was disappointed because the panty line on this shape wear was showing on the dress therefore not getting the seamless look.,61732,3
61732,I still ended up buying Spanx which worked better.,61732,3
61732,Did not bother with the return since it's not that expensive and I could probably wear in the future.,61732,3
61734,It was nice but A little small,61734,3
61736,"I ADORE this suit, but doesn't fit at all.",61736,3
61736,Doesn't make my body look good at all :(,61736,3
61737,This is slightly larger than I expected.,61737,3
61737,It keeps falling off my shoulders.,61737,3
61738,I LOVE LOVE LOVE the support these sandals give.,61738,3
61738,They also look quite nice.,61738,3
61738,At first they were a bit tight everywhere but after a couple of days they stretched out.,61738,3
61738,"After a month, they were too loose!",61738,3
61738,"However, I am speechless at the quality of Velcro...It literally detached after a few weeks and I had to sew them back on!",61738,3
61738,Doesn't look so nice anymore.,61738,3
61738,I would seriously consider returning them to the manufacturer (not Zappos) if I had bought them from Vionic itself.,61738,3
61738,"Velcro not just detached, it stopped holding altogether, so I needed to buy all new better Velcro.",61738,3
61738,"For shoes that expensive, this is absolutely unacceptable.",61738,3
61738,Payless has WAY better Velcro!,61738,3
61738,"I do need the arch support so I will keep looking for non-Velcro styles, as I see many people complain about the Velcro.",61738,3
61739,My daughter put it on and the chain broke.,61739,3
61739,But love it otherwise,61739,3
61740,Cute idea but the material is super thin and not very flattering.,61740,3
61741,"I should have known, but once the socks are on, the image becomes distorted/stretched and doesn't look as good.",61741,3
61742,I ordered an XL for this dress.,61742,3
61742,"When it arrived I was head over heels with how cute the dress was, but after trying it on, I soon discovered that this dress is not meant for big breasted women, as my breasts were so smushed in the dress that they hurt.",61742,3
61742,"Needless to say, I gave the dress to my sister-in-law who has smaller breasts and it looks gorgeous on her.",61742,3
61744,I like the partial see through quality of these underwear.,61744,3
61744,Not really wearable all day at work kind of underwear though.,61744,3
61744,Having your junk in the pouch up front does get painful after long periods of time.,61744,3
61746,"It a nice dress but man is small, Im a little girl so I ordered Small but I should have ordered a Medium I think, Actually got stuck trying to get it off ha!",61746,3
61746,", I like the skirt but I don't like the puff thingy on the slevees so much",61746,3
61747,"Falls out too often, lost them first week.-_-",61747,3
61749,Everything about this hoodie is great EXCEPT its LONG.,61749,3
61749,Something Im not too fond of.,61749,3
61751,"The bar is very short & bends all the way back, so it is very difficult to maneuver into place, even harder to grab enough post on the other side to actually click into place",61751,3
61752,WAY bigger than a normal size medium.,61752,3
61753,"it was too small, i like the material it was made with and the design of them, they were just made too small.",61753,3
61754,I like the goodie but it does fit a little small.,61754,3
61755,A little softer than I prefer but good buy for the money.,61755,3
61756,I have no but I think that's why it had no affect on my bottom it just parted my butt cheek and my leg which it looks saggy not cute!,61756,3
61756,The only thing I like was the firmness from the wait part it really pulls you in and gives you a good waist line :),61756,3
61757,bigger than i thought and i ordered silver but got gold anyway,61757,3
61758,"Note, this dress is not flattering on busty women - granted I am rediculously busty at a solid 36M, with a very hourglass figure, but even on my sister in law - someone less busty - the dress sat awkward.. Like it flares out way too high.",61758,3
61758,"It looks great in some of the pictures of smaller ladies, but even though it comes in larger sizes, I'm not positive this dress works well for some of us gals who are .. Err.. More filled out.",61758,3
61760,Bought size 12 for my sons.,61760,3
61760,"Body fit was fine, they say the pajama feet are too small.",61760,3
61760,They have size 6 feet.,61760,3
61761,"It was a lovely dress, but I didn't realize it would be so short.",61761,3
61761,"Not appropriate for the use I had in mind, but lovely all the same",61761,3
61762,I use them in snow to clean driveway and my hands were not warm,61762,3
61763,I ordered the pink.,61763,3
61763,This is a lovely design but the one I received was much more orange than pink.,61763,3
61763,It was not at all the shade shown.,61763,3
61764,Kind of a cheap material and the bottom is pretty small.,61764,3
61765,The paint was kinda blotchy on a couple of petals but unless you were looking for details you wouldn't notice.,61765,3
61766,"Fit and quality of these pants are nice, but I am 5'9-10 and these are not long enough for me.",61766,3
61766,"They look super long, but they are high wasted and much of the length is taken up in the waist.",61766,3
61766,Not enough length for me even in flats.,61766,3
61766,"I bought I think in a 9, usually would wear a 6 so size up  a bit for a proper fit.",61766,3
61767,Like REALLY SUPER DUPER boxy.,61767,3
61767,"On the model, it looks a little loose and boxy.",61767,3
61767,"It's a tent, and a pretty short tent (it doesn't come as low on me as it does on the model, and I'm only 5'2).",61767,3
61767,"The fabric is nice, a little more sheer than I would've liked, but still soft and a beautiful color.",61767,3
61767,"And it overall does look well made, no loose threads in mine or anything.",61767,3
61767,"I'm probably going to hang on to it for a bit and see if I can make it work with partial tucks or something, or fully tucked into a high waisted skirt or something, but yeah, the cut on this is a little boxier than expected.",61767,3
61768,The XL is more like a medium or even a small.,61768,3
61769,Fit fine for length but large around the waist.,61769,3
61770,"Both the ""Time Turner"" and the ""Deathly Hallow"" pendant are cute.",61770,3
61770,The chains are very weak though.,61770,3
61770,It has broken twice in a week.,61770,3
61771,Pertinent information for anyone interested in buying this.,61771,3
61771,"1) This item is both small AND slim fitting, so effectively about two sizes small.",61771,3
61771,"I got one size larger and, in retrospect, should have gotten two sizes larger.",61771,3
61771,2) The exterior fabric is not very thick.,61771,3
61771,"It's fine, but not a winter coat.",61771,3
61771,Would make a nice autumn coat.,61771,3
61771,I have the Match Men's pea coat which is thicker and much better for winter.,61771,3
61771,Look to this one for a fashionable autumn coat.,61771,3
61771,"3) There is NO inside pocket, and the exterior button pocket is microscopic and could only fit perhaps a key ring with 3 keys or less.",61771,3
61771,Will not fit a small money clip or even an ID Card or whatnot.,61771,3
61771,"4) Even though the jacket is small and slim fitting, the neck guard when the jack is fully buttoned is way too big.",61771,3
61771,"The chest is slim fitting up to there and then all of the sudden it is just loose and extends about an extra two inches forward (mind that the neck goes inward, not outward!).",61771,3
61771,It looks very strange.,61771,3
61771,"Ultimately, not a bad coat, certainly not for the money, but it is A) NOT a winter coat, just a fashionable autumn coat and B) you need to take some considerations as to sizing and utility before you purchase.",61771,3
61771,It is very small and slim and won't have much storage either.,61771,3
61772,"Beautiful shirt NOT dress, wayyy to short for a dress.",61772,3
61774,It seems to fall apart pretty easily.,61774,3
61775,"It's cute, it will work for what I need it for so I'm happy with my purchase.",61775,3
61776,"The fabric is really nice, but if conditions are just right the seam in the 'pouch' area will land right on your bell-end.",61776,3
61776,If you're going to do a lot of walking or active things me mindful of your schwartz.,61776,3
61778,Good material but very tiny and revealing more than covering..,61778,3
61779,The lenses on these glasses are definitely a little bit smaller than I expected; which is great because I have a very small face and sometimes large glasses can tend to make me look like an insect.,61779,3
61779,"However, the material is very very flimsy and they glasses came in a little crooked when they arrived in the mail.",61779,3
61779,It wasn't that big of a deal because the material is very easy to work with when you need to bend them back in place.,61779,3
61779,"Another small issue I had is that the nose pads are made out of metal rather than plastic; and if you're like me and you tend to leave your sunglasses in the car, it becomes a hassle when you go to put them on on a hot summer day if they've been sitting in the car for long.",61779,3
61779,"Overall these are very cute, stylish glasses, and you honestly can't beat the price!",61779,3
61779,All the issues I had were very minor and I would most likely order another pair.,61779,3
61780,"I'm 5'6, normally a size medium.",61780,3
61780,I ordered this standard size expecting to need to wear another skirt underneath and to take it in on places.,61780,3
61780,"I will need to wear another skirt underneath, but I won't have to take it in.",61780,3
61780,I wish it wasn't a fuzzy material but this was the only dress I could find to transform into Magenta and overall I am very satisfied.,61780,3
61781,A little bit it itchey,61781,3
61782,Received necklace early which was a nice surprise.,61782,3
61782,The Skull is big and sturdy.,61782,3
61782,I was worried it was going to be really thin metal but it is not.,61782,3
61782,You can't even bend it with your hands.,61782,3
61782,But the chain on the other hand was horrible I have to say.,61782,3
61782,It was more the size for small child and it was kind of spiky if you were to wear it it would definitely slice up your neck.,61782,3
61782,But luckily I have a long chain and I can put the skull pendant on there.,61782,3
61782,So if you're looking for a nice sturdy skull that is a good size then I would recommend this but if you're looking for a nice chain I would look somewhere else.,61782,3
61783,"Great top, different for sure, but buyer beware of the glitter.",61783,3
61783,I actually hid the cape from my daughter in anticipation of the mess.,61783,3
61783,She found it before I could get rid of it!,61783,3
61784,Very cute just runs very small.,61784,3
61784,Definately not true to size.,61784,3
61785,"Very cute shirt, however I normally wear a 10 or 12.",61785,3
61785,"It was supposed to be a 12, but is closer to an 8.",61785,3
61786,The hat seems to be of great quality but it is to small for my husband.,61786,3
61787,"Everything about it was fine, but it was 2 or 3 sizes too small.",61787,3
61788,ordered a 5.5 fit like a 6.5  so I soaked them down and wore them till dry  now they fit like a 6. they are vey cute jut order a size smaller,61788,3
61789,It's a bit irritating to wear the ring pinches and will not stay up right.,61789,3
61789,The bracelet doesn't fit snug enough to stay up on my arm where I wish it too.,61789,3
61790,"Not the best construction, but the colors are exact.",61790,3
61792,The Naviforce Sports Watch is very large and thick.,61792,3
61792,The overall watch is fine but the electronic LCD display is poor.,61792,3
61792,Does not appear as shown in the picture that is on the website!,61792,3
61792,It is very difficult to see...even in dim light.,61792,3
61792,The lighted feature only stays on for three seconds which is barely enough time to focus on what you are trying to see.,61792,3
61792,"There is a row of days displayed, and (even if set correctly...also difficult with the instructions provided) it is virtually impossible to tell which day is being highlighted.",61792,3
61792,"The alarm apparently sounds out the back of the watch, so if it is on your wrist, it is not loud enough to wake you up.",61792,3
61792,"Perhaps, it is designed only to be a reminder for a person who is already awake.",61792,3
61792,The pins in the band were very difficult to remove so as to remove links and adjust the band.,61792,3
61792,"Again, more thorough instructions would have been helpful.",61792,3
61792,"Considering the price, it is probably a great watch for the value, but I would want the displays brightened, and the instructions for setting all of the functions of the watch to have been more thorough.",61792,3
61793,This dress is very see-through.,61793,3
61793,"I am not hugely impressed with this, as I am wearing a very light color bra in the pictures and yet you can still see it.",61793,3
61793,"I bought a medium (34DDD, 5'6"" 160lbs) and it fits like most larges do.",61793,3
61793,"I recognize that the dress is a looser cut, but it's too loose, and makes me look like a box.",61793,3
61793,Size down and buy a dark color is you're still going to buy it.,61793,3
61794,It has a horrid smell.,61794,3
61795,"was a bit small, I thought I would have more room.",61795,3
61796,"Letters are straight across, I'm 5' and 103 lbs, the s/m is slightly large on me.",61796,3
61796,"Cute though, and very soft on the inside.",61796,3
61797,This is not one size fits all in my opinion.,61797,3
61797,I wear a medium and can barely fit in this.,61797,3
61798,The seller is friendly- so I am not rating this a 3 based on that.,61798,3
61798,I do not consider myself to have a long torso- I'm pretty proportionate- however- this swim suit did not fit at all.,61798,3
61798,"I stepped into it, and the suit did not go from crotch to neck- it ended just under my breasts.",61798,3
61798,So I could not even pull the straps up.,61798,3
61798,"I am 5'5""- so not a tall person at all :) Just an FYI for buyers....",61798,3
61799,I didn't know it came so small.,61799,3
61800,First off I ordered gray and got a white shirt also this is a total knock off.,61800,3
61800,It fits alright and your still wearing the Gonz but I wanted people to know,61800,3
61801,I'm usually a medium.,61801,3
61801,I bought a large so it would be a little big.,61801,3
61801,It is tighter than some of my other medium-sized t-shirts.,61801,3
61803,Nice a little big,61803,3
61804,Order 2 sizes up your average size.,61804,3
61805,The collar is really big.,61805,3
61805,I've never had a Hawaiian shirt before so I don't know if it's supposed to be that way.,61805,3
61805,Doesn't look too appealing.,61805,3
61806,"I read the reviews that these run small, extremely small, I typically wear medium / large, so I ordered an extra large, it barely fits.",61806,3
61806,Cute but too small!,61806,3
61807,It was super cute but the buttons were plastic and didn't stay together very well.,61807,3
61808,fine but too thick to be realistic nose ring,61808,3
61809,They worked for my costume but they already are falling apart on the second wear.,61809,3
61810,i liked it i coated it in clear nail polish so the color wouldnt change but of course the bottom of the box came off what a bummer,61810,3
61812,little tight but I like them,61812,3
61813,3 stars only because it is not yellow but more of a yellow ochre/forest green color.,61813,3
61813,Otherwise it is beautiful.,61813,3
61814,I was really excited to get this because I love green adventurine and Chakra pendants; however this one came with some serious flaws.,61814,3
61814,The stone isn't put into the stainless steel housing evenly so its lopsided (see photo).,61814,3
61814,There is also glue showing.,61814,3
61814,The pendant is 1 9/16 inches long including the bale.,61814,3
61814,The actual stone is 1 5/16 inches.,61814,3
61814,It comes with a 21.5 inch stainless steel chain necklace that is pretty useless to me because it looks cheap.,61814,3
61814,Plus its not long enough for me.,61814,3
61814,Also comes in a gift bag.,61814,3
61814,"Not sure if these pendants are inspected before they leave the factory and how it got through, but it doesnt say much for them in my opinion.",61814,3
61814,If you take the care to put your jewelry in a gift bag make sure its checked first to make sure its deserving of that presentation.,61814,3
61815,It looks good in the picture but when I got it it was kind of flimsy and I am afraid it won't last.,61815,3
61815,I have only worn it once so I am not sure how it will hold up.,61815,3
61815,It was comfortable on my toe but moved around a lot and I was afraid I might lose it.,61815,3
61816,"This is a substantial t-shirt like knit fabric that does not have an easy flow, but rather is a bit stiffer.",61816,3
61816,"It is casual, not for dress - good for around the house and yard.",61816,3
61816,I bought 2 and will use them for house/yard days.,61816,3
61816,Have not washed them yet.,61816,3
61817,This is cute I did have bunching at the stomach area for my shape it wasn't as flattering as other bathing suits so I decided to wear it with shorts.,61817,3
61817,If you are lean and straight up and down this is for you.,61817,3
61817,If you are curvy pass on this one,61817,3
61819,"Just a little short 5""7",61819,3
61820,the material is too thin....,61820,3
61821,Decent quality for the price.,61821,3
61821,I bought a medium.,61821,3
61821,My waist 32.5 inches and it fit ok - maybe a little on the snug side.,61821,3
61821,"I'm 5'4"" and they are about 3"" longer than I like but it has elastic and zipper at bottom.",61821,3
61821,All zippers are plastic if that's a concern.,61821,3
61822,If you are ordering clothing make sure it is not a company in China.,61822,3
61822,The clothes run very very amall,61822,3
61823,Nice but to big for my face,61823,3
61824,It was much smaller than advertised on the size chart.,61824,3
61826,Love the bag itself but the handles won't stay buckled.,61826,3
61827,"Somewhat small, adhesive was very sticky the first time, the the second time it wasn't too good but stayed on okay, third time threw out.",61827,3
61828,"Neck is open and has a lot of room inside, doesn't hug the body.",61828,3
61828,But cute for a picture,61828,3
61830,Love this and looks fabulous with leggings tank and boots for winter and sandals in summer.,61830,3
61830,"HOWEVER, I'm a size 4-6 and 5'3"" and this is super small and very tight.",61830,3
61830,Unless you are a size 0-2 it will most likely not work for you.,61830,3
61830,The one area that worked perfectly for me was the bust.,61830,3
61830,"So, this may be a bit too roomy for some.",61830,3
61830,"I'm a 32DDD

Really bummed because I like it.",61830,3
61830,I'm going to keep it and try to have tailored for a little more room.,61830,3
61831,"It has very slight material, but it is a comfortable warm weather sleep top.",61831,3
61831,"It doesn't cover much so that must be the ""sexy"" thing.",61831,3
61832,"This product came highly recommended to me, for post partum recovery but I didn't care for it much, nor did I use it often.",61832,3
61832,"I am 5'3"" with a fairly short waist and it bunched up everytime I sat down (which you do a lot of post partum) leaving folds in the corset and defeating it's purpose.",61832,3
61832,I recommend getting something with boning or just doing safe ab exercises!,61832,3
61834,this is another dress that I prob cant wear do to the material being to thin and see through,61834,3
61835,I'm 5'1 and 138 lbs and a 36DD  (technically overweight) and the large was too big.,61835,3
61835,If you normally buy juniors (from places like Charlotte russe or Agaci) then it runs true to size.,61835,3
61836,The material is very thin and it really did not hold my hair in place like some others that I have.,61836,3
61837,"However one was broken on arrival, and it took 2 seconds for the other to get water in it ruining the inside dandelion.",61837,3
61837,"They did offer to ship a new one, and I declined, and they refunded my money.",61837,3
61837,They were prompt with dealing with this situation.,61837,3
61837,"I would consider ordering a new one, if the were sealed right, and didn't take so long to ship.",61837,3
61838,"The wallet is great and the leather is decent, my only problem is that the brown coloring is starting to wear off after only 4 months and showing black marks.",61838,3
61838,For a wallet I don't feel this is acceptable since this is something I should be able to expect to have it last a longer time than 4 months before it shows wear.,61838,3
61838,I had a Fossil wallet that this is replacing that is still in perfect condition after 5 years but is too bulky for my current needs.,61838,3
61840,It fits my daughter realy good,61840,3
61841,"slightly small, tight fit",61841,3
61842,"Pretty, but the clasp doesn't work quite right.",61842,3
61842,I have trouble opening and closing it.,61842,3
61843,This dress fits pretty well but if you are bigger chested the buttons pull apart since the holes are stretchy material.,61843,3
61843,It's pretty and comfortable but for me personally I have to safety pin the top to keep it closed.,61843,3
61843,I ordered two sizes bigger than I wear knowing it was going to run small.,61843,3
61843,If you are small to medium size in the chest this dress wpuld be perfect but anyone who is pretty big in that area will have issues.,61843,3
61844,Very Cute and my daughter loves it so that is what counts,61844,3
61845,I don't like the fact that i didn't recive exactly what is pictured ....,61845,3
61846,The description says these earring backs are medium.,61846,3
61846,They are actually very small.,61846,3
61847,It shipped quickly and was as expected except for the hole that was in the side.,61847,3
61847,I had to sew it up before she could wear it.,61847,3
61848,Beading on the dress make it uncomfortable.,61848,3
61848,I returned this dress but it was very cute.,61848,3
61849,The material got a lot of pulls in it after just an couple of hours of use at a water park.,61849,3
61849,They were great for a one day need but were pretty much shot by the end of the day.,61849,3
61851,"Wow, this is really quite large in some ways and too small in others.",61851,3
61851,"Ihe arms are made for incredibly short people; I'm 5'9"" and the elastic hits me just below the elbow.",61851,3
61851,"The width is quite extreme as it's loose across the shoulder elastic, and there is a LOT of body to the base of the shirt.",61851,3
61851,"It's a lightweight fabric, a little cheap.",61851,3
61851,"Will have to wear tucked in to make work as a cute shirt, or else it's just unflattering given that I'm not a tiny person.",61851,3
61851,Recommend ordering down a size.,61851,3
61852,The bottom part was loose fitting but it was comfy.,61852,3
61852,Only wore it once so far.,61852,3
61853,"Actually a little rough material
Very long for a toddler i guess but yet thin width which is good
All in all not bad!",61853,3
61854,"These are super cute and I love the pink stone, but they were very tiny!",61854,3
61855,"Nicely made, it's big and very sparkly.",61855,3
61855,"So if you looking for something to stand out, this it's just perfect.",61855,3
61856,It's big but beautiful.,61856,3
61857,The mouse pad looks amazing!,61857,3
61857,"But I was told it would arrive within a week, then three days later, and then it took three days later than that to arrive.",61857,3
61859,This thing is HUUUUUUUGE!,61859,3
61859,I only wear it very very rarely as it is so large I cannot wear any other accessories with it or I look like a jewelry tree.,61859,3
61859,"While it is very pretty, I'm not sure why anyone would make one so big.",61859,3
61859,"Yes my bad for not using the measurements, but again, I never thought for a single second that there would be something this darn big out there.",61859,3
61859,"It is also pretty heavy, and every time I would talk or move my mouth i would feel it brushing on my upper lip.",61859,3
61859,I don't like to be constantly aware of my facial jewelry.,61859,3
61859,"If you like huge glaring septum rings, this one is for you.",61859,3
61859,"If you like dainty and unobtrusive, this is not for you.",61859,3
61860,"The product arrived quickly, the product looks good.",61860,3
61860,"I read that some people had an issue with the material tearing, mine did not have this issue.",61860,3
61860,The only reason I took stars away is the fit.,61860,3
61860,I am a petite woman.,61860,3
61860,Ordered an xs because I have thin legs.,61860,3
61860,The waist of the pants had very little stretch.,61860,3
61860,I could hardly get them up over my hips.,61860,3
61860,"The legs of the pants fit like a medium, they were baggy and looked horrible on.",61860,3
61860,"If you have no hips and thick legs, these may be for you.",61860,3
61860,But if you have thin legs then these may not be the pants for you.,61860,3
61861,"Love the dress but the sleeves a bit more ""poofy"" than what I had anticipated.",61861,3
61862,Coat runs very small.,61862,3
61862,Order up 2 sizes.,61862,3
61862,It's tight around the arms and waist area.,61862,3
61862,Mine came WITHOUT the fur trim collar.,61862,3
61862,And there's no way Amazon can replace just the fur trim that wasn't included on the coat.,61862,3
61863,It doesn't work as well with slacks as it does with jeans.,61863,3
61864,"I love the swimsuit and the way it fit, very flattering.",61864,3
61864,Was coming apart at the seams in a few places and had some strings hanging from it which is why I sent it back.,61864,3
61864,"I did not wear it in water, but while the front is double layered, the back is only a single layer and just trying it on I could just about see through it!",61864,3
61864,I loved it and wished it was thicker in the back.,61864,3
61864,I would have rated 5 stars otherwise!,61864,3
61865,"I like these leggings - they are comfortable, soft and easy to pull on and off.",61865,3
61865,They go great under dresses or skirts in the winter.,61865,3
61865,"However - 3 star rating instead of five, because they did not come as pictured.",61865,3
61865,"These leggings are far longer than what is pictured, and go all the way down to my ankles!!!!",61865,3
61865,"I am 5'9 and not short by any means, so I felt a little annoyed when I got these that I couldn't wear them as pictured, especially since I like tights at mid calf under skirts and dresses way more than to ankle.",61865,3
61865,Also the material is a little bit see-through but not too bad.,61865,3
61866,Quality not to good,61866,3
61867,"It's a bit tighter than I would have liked for this sort of thing, especially around the neck.",61867,3
61868,The stitching came lose around the waist area.,61868,3
61869,It's beautiful but a little flimsy but for the price it's good.,61869,3
61870,the large is just to large,61870,3
61871,"For the price, this dress is great.",61871,3
61871,"However, overall it is just okay for me.",61871,3
61871,The material is different than materials used in other vintage dresses I have purchased.,61871,3
61871,It is almost like a t-shirt material with very little actual structure.,61871,3
61871,"Additionally it is a little loose in the waist, but I am small so that isn't really the dresses fault.",61871,3
61871,My only other complaint is it hit at a weird level for me around the knee.,61871,3
61871,"I would have preferred the ruffles to hit slightly lower, but I can work with it.",61871,3
61871,For reference I ordered a size small and my measurements are 33-25-35.,61871,3
61872,"Obviously, you can only use in your ""cold swimming pool state"".",61872,3
61872,"The ties really don't do anything, so I cut them off.",61872,3
61872,It stretches nicely over my package and feels very comfortable.,61872,3
61873,little skimpier than I expected.,61873,3
61873,I would recommend possibly a size larger than usual.,61873,3
61874,these tops were just okay....nothing special.,61874,3
61875,"They're pretty and bright and vibrantly colored and the material feels nice to the touch, they are super small and I can't even get the person I got them for to even try them on, much less wear them in public.",61875,3
61875,"So, if you want them, make sure that you get at least a size bigger than you normally wear and maybe two sizes bigger.",61875,3
61876,The finish seems to be dull not like the past wallets I have gotten from other sources,61876,3
61877,Not what I was expecting for my son,61877,3
61878,"it'd be a good fit for you if you are shorter probably 5'6"" and under",61878,3
61879,I chose the size XL based off of what I read in the reviews.,61879,3
61879,This runs a little small...,61879,3
61879,"Overall, I do like the shirt.",61879,3
61879,I'd probably order it again if I could order it one size up,61879,3
61880,"Too large, and frumpy looking I'm 5'4"" and it came to my shins.",61880,3
61881,These are cute but very thin.,61881,3
61881,"I washed them immediately and unfortunately, my son had a piece of gum in his pants pockets and these became covered with sticky, Fluorescent gum.",61881,3
61881,I had to throw them away.,61881,3
61882,Nothing Fancy...It's hard to believe this is 100% cotton.,61882,3
61882,It seems too stretchy for cotton.,61882,3
61882,"I usually wear a Large, but ordered a Medium based on reviews...the medium is a bit large.",61882,3
61882,For the price it's okay and comfortable.,61882,3
61882,It's not as pretty as I'd hoped.,61882,3
61882,Make me feel a bit dowdy to tell the truth.,61882,3
61882,"I won't buy again...I like to feel pretty, even in PJ's...So I'll look elsewhere and pay the extra monies for something a bit nicer.",61882,3
61883,I hate to post a negative review because I think I didn't like this dress mostly due to my body shape.,61883,3
61883,"The dress seemed very well constructed and didn't seem cheap, but it was just very awkward on my body.",61883,3
61885,Beautiful work love the dress but it runs a bit big or maybe true to size not.,61885,3
61885,My little one is on the petite side and it between sizes so it fit her too big.,61885,3
61887,"its exactly as pictured, and very cute.",61887,3
61887,"However, the top is a little low.",61887,3
61887,"I'm 180 and 5'4, and ordered a 52/18-20.",61887,3
61887,It fit perfectly besides the fact that the bra cups were a few inches lower than suppose to be.,61887,3
61888,Cute but the bows on the back came off as soon as we put them on.,61888,3
61888,Which was a bummer.,61888,3
61889,"The outfit is cute, especially for the price.",61889,3
61889,"The black part of the shirt looks EXTREMELY faded after one wash, though.",61889,3
61889,"I'm glad I took a picture of him wearing it the first time, because it looks like a hand-me-down now.",61889,3
61889,"The pants are cheaply made and it shows on the inside, where there are loose threada and rough seams.",61889,3
61889,"All in all, it's okay for the $.",61889,3
61890,For a size 2 the waist fit perfect but the bust was so large like a D cup.,61890,3
61890,Couldn't alter with all the beads so had to sew in pads-not ideal.,61890,3
61890,The beading was not the same pattern as pictured.,61890,3
61890,"Lastly the dress length was extremely long and had to shorten even with 3"" heels.",61890,3
61890,Ended up paying as much for alterations as paid for dress.,61890,3
61891,"While the flannel is nice and long, the sleeves are a bit short and uncomfortable.",61891,3
61891,"Other than that, this is a pretty cute flannel.",61891,3
61893,Lasted a tad over a year.,61893,3
61893,I wore this ratchet belt buckle daily with various colored belts until it finally gave up on me.,61893,3
61893,The metal bar mechanism finally cracked so the spring fell out making the buckle useless.,61893,3
61894,Beautiful dress but it just was too small for me.,61894,3
61896,"Typically a 4/6, depending on material.",61896,3
61896,According to my measurement I should have bought a large but I didn't.,61896,3
61896,I bought a small.,61896,3
61896,The light blue didn't fit at all.,61896,3
61896,No give and very stiff.,61896,3
61896,The navy was a totally different story!,61896,3
61896,I'm very happy I bought the small.,61896,3
61896,It's down to my knees and fits.,61896,3
61896,"It's not tight, just fits.",61896,3
61896,I wore a dress shaper under( pantylines becaise the materials on the thinner side) and felt great.,61896,3
61897,"Cute hat, kind of large and it is not very structured.",61897,3
61898,I needed to order a size or two larger to get it to fit like the she is wearing in the picture.,61898,3
61898,"I thought it was more of a sweater, yarn material and thicker.",61898,3
61898,"This is thin, soft, and more like a t-shirt material.",61898,3
61898,I guess I should of read the other reviews.,61898,3
61898,"If it wasn't a hassle to exchanged it, I would exchange for a larger size but they don't offer any larger size.",61898,3
61899,I read the reviews and ordered accordingly.,61899,3
61899,"I'm 5'11, 180lbs, with average build (I don't visit a gym).",61899,3
61899,"Overall it does fit my torso, neck and sleeve length, BUT the sleeves themselves are fairly narrow all the way from the shoulder to the wrist.",61899,3
61899,"While it does fit ok for standing/walking around, the sleeves get very tight around my biceps if I am holding anything (or flex ever so slightly).",61899,3
61899,"If you work out or don't consider yourself a slim guy, this shirt may not be for you.",61899,3
61899,I like the pattern and the fabric seems decent.,61899,3
61899,Although there were many threads I had to trim from buttons and hems so I can't say if this shirt will last more than 3-4 washes.,61899,3
61899,It is not a premium quality shirt by any stretch but it does not look cheap at all.,61899,3
61900,The dress is nice but however it is too large.,61900,3
61901,Seems like it's made well overall.,61901,3
61901,"I ordered a large according to size chart and it's tight through the shoulders, wish I'd gotten the extra-large.",61901,3
61901,It also isn't as warm as I thought it would be; the lining is very thin and the outter shell dosent feel like neoprene.,61901,3
61901,Overall it was worth the money and it is usable but not what I thought it would be.,61901,3
61902,weird fit and cheap metal hard ti keep upwards look,61902,3
61903,The mask is pretty however it came completely bent up to fit inside the small shipping box.,61903,3
61903,"Even after carefully bending the pieces back to place, there were still wrinkles in the metal noticeable from a few feet away.",61903,3
61904,The jacket came in about a week and Nicely packaged.,61904,3
61904,I will say I was somewhat surprised by the size of the package as I was expecting something a bit larger.,61904,3
61904,"It isn't any kind of thick material, not something for really cold temps.",61904,3
61904,"If you order the black color, it is jet black, not like the Amazon photo where it's grayish.",61904,3
61904,"I also CANNOT stress enough that if you're ordering any clothing from China or surrounding areas, ORDER AT LEAST ONE SIZE UP.",61904,3
61904,It was a little snug to say the least and I'll have to reorder another on most likely due to this fact.,61904,3
61905,"Was just like an ordinary black long sleeve shirt ,didn't hang much at all i had to alter it a little to have hang the way it looked on the picture.",61905,3
61905,Im a medium /large i ordered an extra large thinking that would do the trick but it didn't.,61905,3
61907,Third corset from same seller.,61907,3
61907,The other two I bought were the Eduardian 26 double steel boned long line corsets and they are spectacular.,61907,3
61907,"While the boning in this wasn't as strong, I was still suprised how well it held its shape and compressed, but it was just a little short for me.",61907,3
61907,Either on top or on the bottom.,61907,3
61908,Cute set but the blue top does not match the tutu.,61908,3
61909,It's cute but very thin .,61909,3
61909,Mine got tangled up and I can't figure out how to fix it :/,61909,3
61910,"These are not shoes, but as they go around a belt, discussing its fit is important.",61910,3
61910,The key holder I received barely fits around my ACU belt.,61910,3
61910,"Not as sturdy as I'd like to see, but holding up well otherwise.",61910,3
61912,"I knew this was a crop length vest when I ordered, but I am a small person and ordered a size large just in case.",61912,3
61912,It is so tight that I can't hook it at the front.,61912,3
61912,I will have to wear it open with a tight shirt so it doesn't look like a hot mess.,61912,3
61913,Shorter than expected and does reach to my thighs as I would prefer.,61913,3
61913,However the fleece lining is of good quality and keeps me warm & cozy,61913,3
61914,"They nice fit my ads great but a little too tight on the crochet area the need too make xx ,LOL",61914,3
61915,A little loose in the chest and tight on waist.,61915,3
61916,"I like it but if you are a large get an extra large, its too small.",61916,3
61916,Im 165 n its just a tad to small,61916,3
61917,"Inexpensive, and you get what you pay for.",61917,3
61917,"Served its purpose, but I wish I'd spent more money.",61917,3
61918,"Design is cute, but (and maybe it said this somewhere) the fabric is like, swimsuit material.",61918,3
61918,"Other than that, fine shirt.",61918,3
61919,"Love this, but looks different color in pic.",61919,3
61919,Wish they had it in black and grey.,61919,3
61920,The chain broke the second day I had it and one wing doesn't want to open easily.,61920,3
61920,"The watch itself is keeping time, so you get what you pay for.",61920,3
61921,i like it but it runs extremely small,61921,3
61922,gave to my daughter size 6,61922,3
61923,took some time to make sure I ordered the right size (as it always different between US and ASIA) BUT the low-quality iron-on Superman symbol is already falling off.,61923,3
61923,"I like the look and fit, but that this factor was unexpected; even at the very low price i didn't expect this to happen so quickly.",61923,3
61923,So now I'm looking for a way to repair it to preserve the fun nature of what these were supposed to be (otw they are just simple blue and red trunks),61923,3
61924,"Nice product but it was too small, will return for a smaller size",61924,3
61925,"Color is lovely, quality is good.",61925,3
61925,"Material is a very lightweight sweatshirt material, not exactly French terry, but not a heavy sweatshirt fleece, actually I prefer it to a regular sweatshirt - more versatile.",61925,3
61925,Sizing and delivery were the issues  Sizes are Asian size.,61925,3
61925,I ordered an XL and it is the equivalent of a S/M in US size.,61925,3
61925,Also took 6 weeks for delivery from China.,61925,3
61926,cute but slipped off a lot!,61926,3
61927,"My daughter ordered these and when she opened the package, 2 of the pendants weren't on the necklace.",61927,3
61927,"Other than that, the other necklaces were in great shape.",61927,3
61928,Cute but way too short for my taste.,61928,3
61929,I did NOT get these at a reduced price.,61929,3
61929,I paid full price.,61929,3
61929,I was lucky in that the all came in unbroken and in good shape.,61929,3
61929,I have small fingers (size 5) and most were way too big- even the midi size fit as normal size rings.,61929,3
61929,"Only one could I wear as a midi, but I expected this.",61929,3
61929,It is really hard for me to find rings that fit me.,61929,3
61929,These are cute styles and of a fairly decent quality.,61929,3
61929,Only one of the elephants seemed a bit easy to break.,61929,3
61929,I was disappointed in the fact that most were just too big to wear.,61929,3
61929,Even the bracelet seemed too big.,61929,3
61929,I pinched it all the way closed and shoved it high on my are to be able to see the design.,61929,3
61929,"If I just left it, the weight of the stone pulls it downward and you cant see it, so it just slides off my wrist.",61929,3
61929,The first thing I did when I opened them up after sizing them was to paint them with silver nail polish.,61929,3
61929,I followed it with clearcoat.,61929,3
61929,The silver added a little bulk and texture so they sat a little better on my fingers.,61929,3
61929,The clearcoat was to make sure they do not turn my fingers green.,61929,3
61929,I did not want to take the chance as most non- gold or silver turns me green.,61929,3
61929,I did not expect these to last more than a summer or two from the get go.,61929,3
61929,These are just a fun one or two season purchase to complete a look.,61929,3
61929,If they break or if I loose them it's not really a big deal to me.,61929,3
61929,They are fun styles.,61929,3
61929,I think the bracelet will last longer than most of the rings.,61929,3
61931,Chest fits too tightly,61931,3
61932,The v neck portion is flattering.,61932,3
61932,However the bottom portion is very long and covers/hugs the bum.,61932,3
61932,Not my kind of style for a sweater.,61932,3
61932,It's very warm though!,61932,3
61933,I ordered a medium and the top fits acceptably but the bottoms fit like they are a large.,61933,3
61933,Not very happy about that at all.,61933,3
61933,Would have been a five start if it wasn't for the uneven fitting.,61933,3
61936,I'm sad that these were so small and that the material was not as soft on the outside as it is on the inside.,61936,3
61937,They were good for a month then started ripping on the seam on the behind leaving holes.,61937,3
61937,Now i can only where with long shirts.,61937,3
61938,"Material soso, thin, not real comfy, but  u get what u pay for.",61938,3
61939,This waist cincher was way to small ...I ordered a medium but on the tag says large ...and it was still too small I am 135 lbs and I have a little tummy and wanted to wear my little black dress .,61939,3
61939,When I put it on it kinda squeezed my butt when it was supposed to make it fuller .,61939,3
61939,Then it reaches right under my bust but it squeezed my back ..so my my tummy is ok but I have back fat hanging over .,61939,3
61939,I liked the material .,61939,3
61939,I'm sorry it didn't quite me .,61939,3
61940,I got an XL it fit a little snug probably like a M/L size,61940,3
61941,I really like the way they look but the white pair broke after a few times being worn.,61941,3
61941,The side that doesn't unscrew broke off and I had a hell of a time getting it out my ear.,61941,3
61941,Had to grab the broken end with a pair of pliers.,61941,3
61942,"The thickness and quality felt great, but I wound up giving it to my 9 year old, instead of the 12 year old it was bought for, due to the smaller sizing.",61942,3
61943,I ordered this shirt 3 times!,61943,3
61943,I decided to order three sizes up based on previous reviews that the size ran small.,61943,3
61943,1st i ordered a XL i usually where a small or medium but xl was way too big.,61943,3
61943,I don't have much chest but my shoulders are pretty broad.,61943,3
61943,So i couldn't get a refund or ship it back to the seller so i emailed them all they could do was give me a refund of $2 bought the shirt for $9.,61943,3
61943,"So i ordered another one in large, way too small I let my 12 yr old sister have it, it ft her very nice.",61943,3
61943,I wanted to try one more time since I really like the shirt and had my eye on it for awhile but hesitated based off of previous reviews of it running small.,61943,3
61943,So i ordered a large.,61943,3
61943,"It didn't fit too bad, but it was a little un comfortable around my shoulders and arms and the sleeves started to ripe in the back whenever i would put my arms out.",61943,3
61943,So i sewed up the little tears around my sleeves.,61943,3
61943,"I was very catious to wear this shirt, i did not hug anyone and was careful to reach down to pick things up.",61943,3
61943,"Sleeves weren't riped, but i wore it a second time and I wasn't very careful and one of my sleeves was ripped almost half way, i only wore the shirt for a few hours and the sleeves did not survive, unless you don't have broad or wide shoulders, this shirt will work for you.",61943,3
61945,"Very nice and fit as expected, the color was way off ordered a royal blur thinking I was getting blue and they were navy blue.",61945,3
61945,Just would have liked a normal blue color.,61945,3
61946,Needs a couple more card slots.,61946,3
61946,That's my only issue.,61946,3
61947,"I needed a extra long tie, but ordered the wrong size.",61947,3
61947,I am going to pass it on to someone else.,61947,3
61948,It doesn't lay flat but it's pretty..,61948,3
61949,The skirt was large around the waist and the chest padding was bulky and looked funny.,61949,3
61950,Little short in length.,61950,3
61951,the holes in the belt were a bit loose,61951,3
61953,Bought five if this for my foster children it was getting cold and after first wash on small load gentle clean the caps were displaced they look all goofy now and aren't as secure as when I bought them.,61953,3
61954,if you have a small arm this will be hard to keep up,61954,3
61955,my daughter loved these shoes.,61955,3
61955,"The lights are vibrant and the shoes overall are comfortable., but they did stop charging the second time we plugged them in so it has defeated the purpose of the shoes.",61955,3
61956,"I ended up buying two, the first one in MED seemed to loose fitting after two uses.",61956,3
61956,SMALL was a better fit.,61956,3
61956,"My disappointment was how noticeable it is, I am wearing it.",61956,3
61956,Where it clasps together in the front bulges under clothes.,61956,3
61957,Beautiful scarf but I did not get an infinity!,61957,3
61957,It is not one large loop but rather a flat piece of material like traditional scarves.,61957,3
61957,The gray is quite lovely so I will keep it but it wasn't as advertised.,61957,3
61958,"Neat idea,  There is a light that blinks on the headset.",61958,3
61958,I am not sure if I'm doing something wrong it is irritating in the dark I feel like my head is landing a plane.,61958,3
61958,I use headphones often at night for apps which help me sleep and these are Not very comfortable inside the ears.,61958,3
61959,I love this pattern and the material is so soft...,61959,3
61959,I just wish it was more true to size.,61959,3
61959,"Luckily I am short so they are long enough for me, but for an average height person theyll most likely be floods.",61959,3
61959,Tight in the hip and butt area too.,61959,3
61960,"This fit my big wrist on the second snap, but the snaps don't look great and it often spins, resulting in the snaps usually being on top.",61960,3
61961,Very cute but runs small.,61961,3
61961,Worse yet had to go all the way to Post Office to sign for package since it arrived three weeks later from Subgapore,61961,3
61962,Was complicated to put on and ran very small.,61962,3
61962,im a size 8/10 and the L was way too small.,61962,3
61963,"This is cute, ultimately, but it took literally three weeks for the odor to dissipate from the bracelet.",61963,3
61963,"Granted, I wasn't wearing it at the time, so that might have slowed down the process, but it was impossible to wear it while it had that strong an odor (when even the cats can't stand to be near you, you know it's a problem).",61963,3
61963,"I suspect it was the glue and not the leather itself that was the source, too.",61963,3
61963,"This bracelet also only adjusts on one side rather than both, so one of those loose strings is purely aesthetic.",61963,3
61963,"All the same, I'm keeping it.",61963,3
61965,The quality of the material was not what I expected.,61965,3
61965,It is really thin and stretchy.,61965,3
61965,Could have been better.,61965,3
61965,"Due to this, I haven't worn it more than once.",61965,3
61966,sleeves are too small,61966,3
61967,Not as plush as photo and difficult to keep on; needs some kind of fastener in the front.,61967,3
61968,"Didn't get all the variety of colors as shown of photo, which was disappointing.",61968,3
61969,I like the hat.,61969,3
61969,the only thing is that the logo its a little bit to small not as the picture but overall a good hat.,61969,3
61970,The material is very thin.,61970,3
61971,Didn't really like the dress,61971,3
61972,I have to lose at least 20 lbs (which will be nice if I can do it) before end of July.,61972,3
61972,The top gaps open in the front and lace on the jacket is not trimmed very well.,61972,3
61973,"Cute, but the design was not quite as advertised, and the clasp is extremely weak.",61973,3
61974,The color is perfect buy the quality is not good,61974,3
61975,The clasp broke after first use.,61975,3
61975,So it is not well made.,61975,3
61975,But it was so cheap I am sure that is why.,61975,3
61975,The actual wolf emblem looks cool and even the leather bracelet part...so my daughter and I are hoping to purchase some better clasps or parts to fix it with.,61975,3
61976,"The material sticks to itself, causing subtle stains.",61976,3
61977,Sizes are drastically off.,61977,3
61977,I'm a size 5-7 and a large didn't fit me.,61977,3
61978,I wish I would have order a small.,61978,3
61978,A med is a little to big for me.,61978,3
61978,It sorta hangs on me does not look very good working in a Hospital.,61978,3
61979,"I love the outer shirt, it's very soft and flows but the tank top looked like an extra small and I ordered a medium.",61979,3
61981,Not too right it's ok,61981,3
61982,Not very good quality linen.,61982,3
61983,The pants fit perfectly but the shirt was rather small but that just means I've got to put my sewing skills to the test.,61983,3
61984,a bit shorter than I expected but it's pretty.,61984,3
61985,Not at all what I was expecting.,61985,3
61985,The top is super tiny (I am a 36 DD and thought the design would give me extra support).,61985,3
61985,And the bottoms are more like a regular cut vs. the cheeky cut shown.,61985,3
61985,Still a beautiful suit and hoping a friend will put it to good use.,61985,3
61986,The top was too small and the bottoms too lose..but it was cute looked like the picture.,61986,3
61986,Gonna give it to my sister,61986,3
61987,Cute bag great size except it's already coming apart :-(,61987,3
61988,fits tight but I'm usually a large.,61988,3
61988,I should have looked defieintely was expecting cotton material.,61988,3
61989,Came with a rip in the shoulder on the seam.,61989,3
61989,Had to sew it up.,61989,3
61990,The size chart is really off.,61990,3
61990,My daughter is 13 and we ordered the 12.,61990,3
61990,It is WAY too large.,61990,3
61991,It was just ok,61991,3
61992,The dress was good the only thing is that the above part tickle my skin a little bit and the dress is a little too long but I van fix that,61992,3
61993,I've heard so many positive things about these panties and I was not pleased with it for several reasons.,61993,3
61994,"It can withstand a lot of force, however the open/close mechanism is extremely loose which can make it a pain when you're trying to close it fast to get into your car.",61994,3
61995,The design on the front had a weird imprint on it and the hat was smaller than expected,61995,3
61996,Cheap but will be OK!,61996,3
61997,It's was a little big on me so I had to reorder it in a smaller size.,61997,3
61997,Measures ur waist first before ordering it.,61997,3
61998,The lace isn't tacked down so one you put them on you'd have huge gaps of the cheap under fabric.,61998,3
61999,Buy a size up they come small and tight,61999,3
62000,"I ordered a large, which is my normal size...this is skin tight, almost to the point of not fitting.",62000,3
62000,I purchased to wear underneath an itchy gray sweater so I'll keep it but there's no way I could wear this alone.,62000,3
62001,Super fast shipping - I would suggest ordering a size OR TWO down.,62001,3
62001,"Way too big for a medium, it's more like an XL.",62001,3
62001,Other than that it looks like the picture.,62001,3
62002,tab bit large but I have a small head,62002,3
62003,This dress looks great.,62003,3
62003,"The colors are the same as pictured, mint, green, and navy.",62003,3
62003,The stitching on the straps came loose after just 1 wearing.,62003,3
62003,I had requested to return it and was going to order another one just like it because it was very comfortable.,62003,3
62003,"However, before I could do so I had major foot surgery and was unable to drive for several weeks.",62003,3
62003,By the time I was able to drive and mail it back it was month after the purchase date so I decided to disregard returning it and refined the straps with some needle and thread!,62003,3
62004,top needs a liner and more coverage.,62004,3
62005,This medium size is so small I don't think it will fit a small woman either.,62005,3
62006,I love the style but they were a bit uneven,62006,3
62007,"I love the color, but I should have listened to other reviewers who state this shirt is very large.",62007,3
62007,I ordered one size up.,62007,3
62007,I could have just stayed with my normal size and it still would have room.,62007,3
62007,I like the fabric and it is very comfortable.,62007,3
62010,Material is a little cheap.,62010,3
62010,But it is acute a- frame dress.,62010,3
62010,I'll wear at some point but wouldn't order again.,62010,3
62011,"I've been eyeing this shirt for a long time, wanting it, but afraid to order it because it looked impossibly sheer.",62011,3
62011,"Still, the style looked so great--that sweet spot between man-tailored and feminine--that I finally ordered it.",62011,3
62011,"When it arrived, I loved it, except for one fatal flaw.",62011,3
62011,"Pros:

*It wasn't nearly as sheer as I feared it would be.",62011,3
62011,A good camisole would have made it decent for the general public.,62011,3
62011,*The material felt silky-nice.,62011,3
62011,"*For the price, though the shirt clearly wasn't fine tailored, the cut looked just as shown.",62011,3
62011,I prepared for happiness.,62011,3
62011,"Cons:

*But here was the fatal flaw: the sleeves were unattractively scrawny, too short and too tight, as if cut for a smaller, shorter person.",62011,3
62011,"The picture shows them scrunched up, but they weren't all that scrunchable.",62011,3
62011,They also weren't long enough or wide enough to be rolled up attractively.,62011,3
62011,"And though the end of the sleeves were just like regular long sleeves, with a button closure, they clearly weren't meant to be full long sleeves either.",62011,3
62011,They ended about 2 inches above my wrist.,62011,3
62011,"I tried it on 3 times, to see if I could live with it, but for me, the sleeves were unworkable.",62011,3
62011,"*Also, except for the scrawny sleeves, the rest of the shirt is pretty big.",62011,3
62011,"I'd normally be a large medium, like a 10 or 12, but the 6 was a bit large, not too large to be a deal breaker, but I'd recommend ordering a size smaller than your usual size.",62011,3
62011,"I'm tall with long arms, so I'm guessing the scrawny arm problem won't apply to everyone.",62011,3
62011,"In every other way, I loved it.",62011,3
62011,"If the shirt fits you, it could be your favorite shirt.",62011,3
62012,Shrunk when i washed them,62012,3
62013,Material is very slinky,62013,3
62014,The waste fit as expected but the length was longer than the picture depicted.,62014,3
62014,Some hemming was required on this product to make it the desired length but that was not the manufacturers fault.,62014,3
62014,Overall good quality product.,62014,3
62014,The material has a silky feeling and is fun to wear.,62014,3
62015,Wear for less than one year and big tear appeared  on the side from the bottom.,62015,3
62015,Wish it last longer.,62015,3
62016,I read the reviews and bought an XL and it was borderline comfortable.,62016,3
62016,The silk is nice and the pattern is as advertised but you really have to be petite to fit into it.,62016,3
62017,Pretty but cheap quality.,62017,3
62018,You have to order a size larger than what you usually wear.,62018,3
62018,The material was of poor quality also.,62018,3
62019,was a little snug in the chest area.,62019,3
62021,This sweater had gathered stitching at the upper back which I didn't like.,62021,3
62021,"Overall, it's a bit cheap, which is to be expected for the price.",62021,3
62021,I also found a number of stitching gaps throughout the item.,62021,3
62021,Would have returned if it wasn't such a hassle.,62021,3
62022,"It's a unique pattern, but kind of boxy looking.",62022,3
62023,"Cute, slightly old fashion jumper.",62023,3
62023,"Im 5'7"" and
 I usually wear a size 16, bout 2xl just to be sure, came out smaller than expected... Buy bigger....",62023,3
62025,The piercings aren't diverse enough with tongue rings being the main piercing in the kit!,62025,3
62025,"It does have some other body piercings, but unless you have your tongue pierced, I wouldn't recommend buying this bundle of piercings!",62025,3
62027,I gave it three starts because I did not get the style shown in the images.,62027,3
62027,"However, I was able to customize them with some pliers and get them more to my liking.",62027,3
62028,"This chain is pretty thin, thinner than I thought.",62028,3
62028,It is okay for super light pendants or charms only.,62028,3
62029,"The crochet top did not look like the picture online, it was shorter than the tank top.",62029,3
62029,"As for the jeans, it ran too wide and baggy.",62029,3
62029,"I wish the jeans looked like the picture, like skinny jeans.",62029,3
62030,Need to get better size charts,62030,3
62032,They do not adjust at all.,62032,3
62032,If you have a small head they may have to stick up quite a bit to fit at your ears making them unstable on your head.,62032,3
62034,After 6 months these started falling apart.,62034,3
62035,"I like things to fit loose, so I order large.",62035,3
62035,I ordered a XL = large,62035,3
62036,Quality and design are great; size is way off.,62036,3
62036,I'll be returning for a larger size.,62036,3
62037,While this product worked great for my twins it was overly tight on their thighs which limited their pool time.,62037,3
62038,Cute colors just runs really big!,62038,3
62039,I need a bigger size.,62039,3
62040,looks and quality are good  but the fit was  somewhat large...my size is  small.,62040,3
62042,its nice but when i sit the chain pops,62042,3
62043,well not as good as pic .,62043,3
62044,"Runs a little small, screen print is kind of cheap looking, but my son likes it, so it's fine by me!",62044,3
62045,"I see now in the description that it says to buy a cup size up, but I do not recall seeing that before I purchased this a month ago.",62045,3
62045,Not sure if I missed it or if they only recently added it.,62045,3
62045,"EDIT: Due to my original review, the company contacted me and was extremely helpful in resolving my issue.",62045,3
62045,The new bra fits much better.,62045,3
62045,"Overall, I think backless, strapless bras are difficult to use, but I'm very pleased with the company's response

In all honestly, I think the fact that the bra is okay (instead of great) is more my size.",62045,3
62045,I think it's harder for women with larger boobs.,62045,3
62045,"The product is very nice quality, but I think it works better from smaller cup sizes.",62045,3
62046,Nice variety of colors.,62046,3
62046,Good fun basic masks.,62046,3
62047,Fabric a little cheap but looks nice,62047,3
62048,"The size chart is not very good, it was somewhat tight in the chest, I wear a XL, I should have gotten a 2x",62048,3
62049,The bathing suit is just as pictured however my top is way too big  I got a 2X due to it possibly running small and having large butt and thighs.,62049,3
62049,The cups on the top are too big unfortunately.,62049,3
62050,Worked a few times then one shoe stopped working completely.,62050,3
62051,"I have to remember, you got what you pay for... this was not expensive :)",62051,3
62052,"It was good for the price, but the chain oxidized very fast.",62052,3
62052,The chain seized a bad smell and an ugly color.,62052,3
62052,I used it only two or three times.,62052,3
62053,I ordered 2 sizes because I had not been able to find any that fit in any of the stores.,62053,3
62053,I normally wear between a 14 and 16 Misses but all the swimsuits are outrageously small.,62053,3
62053,This has happened in the last 5 or 6 years since I bought my previous swimsuit.,62053,3
62053,"Anyway, I bought a size 18 and a size 20 and had it shipped since we live in a very rural area and no shopping.",62053,3
62053,My measurements didn't seem to fit in anywhere and I think it's the same with most people's measurements.,62053,3
62053,None of the size guides online match anyone's real sizes it's nuts!,62053,3
62053,"Anyway, when I got the suits, I tried them on and neither one fit.",62053,3
62053,The 20 of course was too large but the weird part is that the size 18 was just as large.,62053,3
62053,I needed a swimsuit and didn't have time to waste looking for another one.,62053,3
62053,It was loose on me when I wore it but it was better than none.,62053,3
62053,I may go back and order the next 2 smaller sizes.,62053,3
62053,"The price was very good in comparison to all the others for sale ($45) and the material seemed well made, the color was very bright and looked good.",62053,3
62053,The style was ok too.,62053,3
62054,"Ordered XXL, and it's barely an XL.",62054,3
62054,Material quality is thin and cheap feeling...definitely not what I expected.,62054,3
62055,Too big but still cute,62055,3
62056,"Very bad quality and cheap material, doesn't look like the picture at all, had to return it.",62056,3
62057,"I love this shirt it is thin silky material, but I ordered an XL and it still does not fit me.",62057,3
62057,I normally fit into L or xl comfortably.,62057,3
62058,"Not going to lie, I bought this one to replace the one i lost, and a few days later it split apart.",62058,3
62058,I fixed it but I shouldn't have had too.,62058,3
62059,"The set does have the same look, but it's a tad altered.",62059,3
62059,"The top is made too small (I am 5'3, 120lbs, small B chest) and it's too small for me.",62059,3
62059,"The two holes that your arms go through leave no room, its tightly wrapped around your underarm and shoulder.",62059,3
62059,The bottom of the top barely reaches the bottom of your breast.,62059,3
62059,It just was not made to fit.,62059,3
62059,The bottoms are not a thong!!!,62059,3
62059,It has a snug fit but it's in no way a thong.,62059,3
62059,"So, basically, you have a top that's too small and a bottom that's too big.",62059,3
62060,"These leggings are nice, but they run EXTREMELY SMALL.",62060,3
62060,"I'm normally a medium, but I had to order an XL.",62060,3
62061,"A light weight knit with a body skimming fit, this cardigan has a soft feel and even finish that looks attractive but reveals any lumps or bumps if your undergarments fit poorly.",62061,3
62061,"I purchased one size up to ease fit issues, which allows me to wear a snug t-shirt under the cardigan and have smooth lines.",62061,3
62062,"These are very pretty and look great, but small.",62062,3
62062,I bought them for my niece who is 1yr old and they leave a mark on her head.,62062,3
62062,"She is of average size, so I'm not satisfied with these.",62062,3
62063,Smaller than expected and logo is not of the best quality,62063,3
62064,Guess these are cool now.,62064,3
62064,He did the top fit but the bottom was pretty small.,62064,3
62064,I offered to return but he didn't want to wait for another pair to arrive so he's wearing tight pants.,62064,3
62064,It did arrive at the beginning of the estimated window.,62064,3
62065,Smaller than I hoped for but I like it for coins.,62065,3
62066,Bought for upper ear piercing.,62066,3
62066,Thick bar hurt my ear.,62066,3
62067,Its okay last min and came before i had to go on vacation so,62067,3
62068,"The dress was really cute, but it was a little too low-cut for my taste.",62068,3
62070,Fits as expected but looks more like a pajama top,62070,3
62071,LOOKS GOOD FROM FAR AWAY BUT FROM CLOSE UP IT'S POOR QUALITY,62071,3
62072,Very cheap material and very thin material,62072,3
62074,This jewelry is beautiful and it was purchased for a birthday gift.,62074,3
62074,"I wanted to put it into a new box, so as I was trying to put the backs on the earring posts, the post bent.",62074,3
62074,I had a really hard time getting the back on.,62074,3
62074,"Eventually I did, but not without bending the post a couple of times.",62074,3
62074,"I just hope that didn't weaken the point of contact to the back of the post, as it will eventually break off and the earring will be of no use.",62074,3
62074,It would be better if the company making them verifies the back can go onto the post without force and the hole is big enough to be used without force.,62074,3
62074,"Don't know if I would buy this line of jewelry again, at least online.",62074,3
62074,Would definitely check how easy the back go on the post first before purchasing.,62074,3
62075,The link from the ring came off leaving chain hanging.,62075,3
62075,This happened on first time being used.,62075,3
62076,Love the colour but it ran a bit too large,62076,3
62077,Size chart is off  it told me to get a medium when I should have ordered a small or x small the shirt is supper cute on.,62077,3
62077,Stick to your normal size If you know what it is.,62077,3
62078,Still fit but was far too tight,62078,3
62079,Fit could be a bit better.,62079,3
62079,I did get lots of compliments,62079,3
62080,wish it had a few more pockets,62080,3
62081,"While these are true to size and soft, the sole immediately developed a lump in the toe area and the shoes became uncomfortable.",62081,3
62081,I'll have to take them to have the sole re-fitted.,62081,3
62083,"its so big i don't even know what to do, i got a small but the neck comes down to my boobs, get one size down from what you are",62083,3
62084,It is see through if you get the white but it fits very nice and would be an adorable swimsuit cover,62084,3
62086,"Obviously cheaply made, sheer material.",62086,3
62086,The shirt is okay.,62086,3
62087,Not near as green as what was shown in the picture... almost black.,62087,3
62087,"Smaller than expected, but still fit... barely.",62087,3
62087,Delivery was much faster than expected.,62087,3
62087,Delivery service was excellent.,62087,3
62087,Showed weeks to deliver only took one week.,62087,3
62088,metal seemed to irritate skin on back of watch,62088,3
62089,gave to my sister to small even though its xl it was fitted,62089,3
62090,"I ORDERED A 2X BECAUSE IT IS COTTON,AND ALLOWING FOR SHRINKAGE., iUSUALLY WEAR 1X, DISSAPOINTED IN THIS TOP AS IT RUNS SMALL.",62090,3

62091,it is very comfortable but..... wouldn't buy again,62091,3
62092,Bought for my 5 month old.,62092,3
62092,So far one of the earrings is striped and tge back will not stay on,62092,3
62093,got wrong product but i am expecting to get replacement !,62093,3
62094,I would definitely order a size up on this cleat model as these run small of your actual size.,62094,3
62095,I bought three of these just for around the house.,62095,3
62095,they are too large in the armpits in my bra sticks out.,62095,3
62095,I am able to alter them on the sewing machine and that took care of the issue but I really didn't want to have to buy something that I had to alter.,62095,3
62096,"It's OK, I'll probably give it to my 11 year-old-grandniece.",62096,3
62096,It says that it's cream colored or ivory.,62096,3
62096,It looks like pale peach to me.,62096,3
62097,Cute hoodie but runs way too large.,62097,3
62097,Kind of weird for a Chineze company since it's usually the opposite.,62097,3
62098,"Run a little small,I'd order a half size larger Will order agin'''",62098,3
62099,"Button came off the first night I wore them, the crotch is also annoying low as are the knees (Suspect that might be due to the wrong size) Other than the button though they're holding up surprisingly well.",62099,3
62099,(Ended up sewing on another one.),62099,3
62100,Too thick for my fingers.,62100,3
62101,It was to long.,62101,3
62101,even when I put it on the smallest size.,62101,3
62101,Had to take it get it cut.,62101,3
62102,"ripped the first time worn, but pretty",62102,3
62103,Pretty but cost is ridiculous.,62103,3
62103,It's just a regular hat like any other.,62103,3
62103,Would have been so much better if they'd made each letter a diff color.,62103,3
62103,Liven it up a little.,62103,3
62104,"Cute, but a little small, and also had a heavy chemical smell be washing.",62104,3
62105,Cute dress but buttons and bow are glued so Do Not tumble dry,62105,3
62106,"Not sure if it's the style or if I received a defective set, but they fit as expected until you wore it for a few minutes and then the zippers popped open.",62106,3
62106,"Also, the zipper cover at the top is a great idea except it's so bulky it pokes through your shirts, so you have a weird bump on your chest.",62106,3
62106,"Nice and tight, would have been supportive.",62106,3
62107,Lenses are slightly small for the frame.,62107,3
62107,Glass is very thin.,62107,3

62108,"Great charm, lovely and just as I expected.",62108,3
62108,"The chain was a little smaller than expected, but still nice, however the clasp broke on the first day.",62108,3
62108,It literally fell off my neck.,62108,3

62112,i like the dress.,62112,3
62112,Fits a little tight.,62112,3
62112,Dress is not that well made.,62112,3
62113,"Sleeves were very short, body was big.",62113,3
62114,The card slots are not big enough to hold other types of cards besides credit (I.e.,62114,3

62115,"Unfortunately I am 6'2"" 240lbs muscled build and the sleeves are tight around my armpit areas and its a bit tight around my back.",62115,3
62115,I would of probably gone with the xxl if you are about my build.,62115,3
62116,"It showed more color in the picture than it really has, mine was mostly white",62116,3
62118,Order a size up these run small!,62118,3
62119,Bumping up a size is recommended.,62119,3
62119,It was suppose to be a gift for my boyfriend and i end up keeping it cause it did not fit him.,62119,3
62119,I had gotten him a Medium and i think i should of gone with Large or possibly maybe a XL.,62119,3
62119,It fit me well though and im a small or extra small,62119,3
62120,Each shirt fit differently.,62120,3
62120,"One was tapered for a woman's figure, one fit like a guy's tshirt and the 3rd hung on me like an XL, but tapered for a woman's figure.",62120,3
62120,The material and patterns were nice.,62120,3
62121,This bathing suit was too small and tight in all the wrong places.,62121,3
62121,It showed all of my flaws I was trying to cover up.,62121,3
62121,The bra part did not fit my chest either.,62121,3
62121,It would look nice on you if you look like the lady in the picture.,62121,3
62121,I bought 2 wantto swim dresses and hope these are more flattering on my fuller figure.,62121,3
62122,Tore on the shoulder seem the first day I wore it.,62122,3
62122,Easy fix but if it wasn't for that I would've given it 5 stars,62122,3
62123,"I am 5'6"" and wear a size 12 jeans at GAP.",62123,3
62123,"So, when I ordered the 1x/2x in these, I expected them to be huge (but I hate tights that are tight around my waist, so I always err towards too large).",62123,3
62123,"Alas - they are too small, which is amazing.",62123,3
62123,"If you're actually plus-sized, these absolutely will not fit.",62123,3
62123,They would fit acceptably on somebody approximately my size but shorter.,62123,3
62123,At least the waist isn't too tight.,62123,3
62123,"But it's going to be a struggle to keep these up, as no matter how much I tug, I can't get the leg portion to actually cover my entire leg.",62123,3
62123,"Aside from the size, though, they seem nice.",62123,3
62124,It is a nice way to change up your look.,62124,3
62124,"A comfortable,adjustable chain, but you have to keep an eye on it since the cross can pass through the infinity symbol.",62124,3
62124,This can make it very easy to lose the item.,62124,3
62125,"The shirt was creative and unique, I just wish they had a bigger size or didn't make it fit so tight.",62125,3
62125,I normally wear a medium and the large just fits me.,62125,3
62125,Otherwise I loved the shirt.,62125,3
62126,little bigger than I expected...the reviews said runs small...I found the opposite.,62126,3
62127,This was a fun costume to wear.,62127,3
62127,The paint job leaves a bit to be desired.,62127,3
62128,Fabric is soft but the product is way too small,62128,3
62129,Received on time and looks good.,62129,3
62130,Shoe is very narrow.,62130,3
62131,"The lace inset isn't lined, so I will have to wear a camisole underneath.",62131,3

62132,"OK, it's a cheap watch, but the display is really weak and hard to see in daylight.",62132,3
62132,You get what you pay for I suppose.,62132,3
62133,I find the shirt to run a little small.,62133,3
62133,"Also it's as though there is only one size print no matter the size of the shirt and it's too small on the shirt I ordered, I'm sure it'd be real cute on a small or medium.",62133,3
62135,"Love this bag, I bought it as a trendy piece to wear casually.",62135,3
62135,"You get what you pay for, because the chain strap did pull apart- nothing that couldn't be fixed easily.",62135,3
62136,The suit is attractive.,62136,3
62136,But the back strap is too tight and has no flexibility.,62136,3
62136,Not certain if the strap closure is strong enough to sustain an active day at the pool.,62136,3
62137,"Love the slogan, but the writing on the hat is almost pink, not white as expected.",62137,3
62137,"Also, the printing of the words is crooked--I would exchange it, but I need it by tomorrow.",62137,3
62138,Cute but a little on the small size.,62138,3
62139,It's kinda odd where the seems are placed on the top piece.,62139,3
62139,And for the price you get what you pay for as far as quality... don't think for a sec that you want to swim around in this thing... pop goes the....,62139,3
62140,"Great price, couldn't quite tell color from picture.",62140,3
62140,"Its a nice dark tan, and kind of glossy.",62140,3
62140,"Immediately lost my new blazer to the Mrs. Looks better on her, trim and stylish.",62140,3
62141,"Kinda flimsy and small, but it's hard to complain for what this cost.",62141,3
62142,It was smaller then I thought it would be and I ordered the largest you had.,62142,3
62143,My daughter loved these.,62143,3
62143,They seemed well made and even came with extra heal taps if replacement was needed.,62143,3
62143,They were VERY small however and she couldn't even get them on her feet.,62143,3
62143,She was recently sized at a children's shoe store.,62143,3
62144,good product runs small,62144,3
62145,it fit tight and it DOES NOT HAVE GLITTER.,62145,3
62147,I love the design of this tee shirt but the sizes run VERY small.,62147,3
62147,They seem more like junior shirt than ladies.,62147,3
62148,Nice fit and comfortable.,62148,3
62148,"The picture is faded though, not a great quality.",62148,3
62148,It's not as nice and clear as it shows in the picture attached.,62148,3
62148,I still really enjoy wearing it though,62148,3
62149,Arrived fast only thing that was different was the color on the shirt was a yellowish White not pure white,62149,3
62150,It's comfortable material and fits decently.,62150,3
62150,Good for casual dates and can be dressed up for something special or office with right accessories.,62150,3
62151,fair price for some pretty good sunglasses,62151,3
62152,"This earrings are pretty, make no mistake about that.",62152,3
62152,"Reasonable for the price, it came in an elegant jewelry box.",62152,3
62152,Great value for someone like me who wanted diamond earrings for less.,62152,3
62152,There are okay !,62152,3
62153,Not as it appears.,62153,3
62153,Gave it as a Christmas gift and was somewhat disappointed that the inscription did not show up well.,62153,3
62154,"I love the style and colors...BUTalas, much too small for my ample busoms !",62154,3
62154,"All is not lost, I am splitting it down the front and adding a wide lace on each side.",62154,3
62154,"It will make a 1 of a kind, light cover-up !",62154,3
62154,"I am not new to the asian size differences, I had to learn to convert inches to centimeters.",62154,3
62154,So I just wrote the conversion down for my sizes and it is much easier.,62154,3
62154,Its like 2.5 cms.,62154,3
62154,"There are tons of clothing items I would love to have, but know they could never fit my frame.",62154,3
62154,"S
If you have a small frame and a smaller ""set"".",62154,3
62154,It is a very sweet dress.,62154,3
62155,"Beautiful ring, poor quality.",62155,3
62155,Stones tend to fall out quickly,62155,3
62157,I was expecting a much larger bag for the price :( otherwise I do like the material & style,62157,3
62158,Quality is good but the fit is HUGE!,62158,3
62158,These are best for VERY chubby babies and toddlers.,62158,3
62158,The legs all the way to the ankle are wide.,62158,3
62158,My very normal 2.5 year old daughter cannot wear these other than to sleep in.,62158,3
62158,They are very baggy and do not look good.,62158,3
62158,However the material and make is decent quality -  so if you need a wider fit - (normal height) these may be for you,62158,3
62160,TMNT thermal shirt - the Colors are BRIGHT & the Printing is CLEAN.,62160,3
62160,The fabric is THIN for a thermal clothing item.,62160,3
62160,But it's one more Check Off on my Christmas shopping list.,62160,3
62161,"They are very comfortable and I like the way they look, but when the sun hits me as I drive they don't protect me.",62161,3
62162,Too small for the size ordered.,62162,3
62163,But they are half size large.,62163,3
62165,"The top isn't as expected , bottom is as expected ......  i will have to make some adjustments to the top so that it will be wearable ..... My expectations of the material and fit weren't high from inception based on the price so .... hope this helps",62165,3
62166,Scratched in a few days to heck.,62166,3
62167,The clasps on the back kept coming undone and where the beading was on the shear part of the dress kept rubbing uncomfortably against my underarm.,62167,3
62168,The breast area is very loose and large and the tank is not long.,62168,3
62168,It is wearable but def doesnt resemble the pic.,62168,3
62168,Awkwardly not form fitting,62168,3
62169,I like this but its very see thru and it seemed to shrink up after the first wash.,62169,3
62170,Expected them to be more thick.,62170,3
62172,Cute and neutral color,62172,3
62173,Just a little bit,62173,3
62174,Bought it for my wife after our first baby.,62174,3
62174,"She loved it, until it started folding.",62174,3
62174,It started showing up over her clothes.,62174,3
62175,"The robe was too small, the top too big and see through.",62175,3
62175,The baby outfit was huge on my baby (7lbs 10 oz) but I LOVE the pants.,62175,3
62175,I still wear them now.,62175,3
62176,The outfit was great.,62176,3
62176,The size was the issue.,62176,3
62176,"Wife is 5' 3"".",62176,3
62176,The medium fit the top but the crotch was down around the knees.,62176,3
62177,I'm sure my friend loved it.,62177,3
62178,This shirt is alright.,62178,3
62178,Material is thin/flimsy and while I ordered up the front was short which was unexpected.,62178,3
62178,It does not appear as a crop in the pic or reviews but that is what I got.,62178,3
62178,"It was also longer-ish in the back, which was nice but not helpful to the too small too short situation.",62178,3
62179,This fit a little smaller than another Miusol dress I bought.,62179,3
62179,"The fabrics are great but the seams on this style were a bit ""off"".",62179,3
62179,All of their products seem to be a good value for the quality you get.,62179,3
62181,top half is a bit big and loose on the armpit area.,62181,3
62182,Very pretty I got a lot of compliments but the buttons fell off after the second use.,62182,3
62182,I had to sew on the buttons again myself because they were so loose.,62182,3
62183,i love these pants!,62183,3
62183,my only thing i wore them for maybe 3 hours not doing much but getting photos taken and watching a movie and when i got home the threading is starting to come undone already.,62183,3
62183,i had a feeling as soon as i felt the fabric for some reason.,62183,3
62183,but they were great for the one time use you can get out of them.,62183,3
62183,I loved how they fit and comfortable they were,62183,3
62184,the skirt is extra long and we had to pay extra for a seamstress to hem it up.,62184,3
62184,its supposed to fit for a 4 year old but do they think the 4 year old is 4 foot 10?,62184,3
62185,I bought these shorts for my husband.,62185,3
62185,"Historically, this is the only brand and style he will wear, and probably has 3 or 4 other pair over the past 10 years.",62185,3
62185,"A summary from him:
The shorts look nice, good fit for athletic build.",62185,3
62185,Nice color and material.,62185,3
62185,"They gap in the back, so a belt is required.",62185,3
62185,"This is different from previous shorts (same style, older models)
No cell phone pocket as previous versions did.",62185,3
62186,Fits perfectly with exact measurements that I had custom ordered.,62186,3
62186,"Although I had some issues with seller & the top of the dress is ""not true to picture"" there were also strings & some beads ready to fall off if not properly cautious handling the dress ,this dress is $1500 at davids bridal & $160 on amazon beautiful dress but I will probably have to send it to a seamstress for a bustle & to repair some slight beadwork.",62186,3
62186,Cant beat the price if your fancy on a budget!,62186,3
62187,A little snug on bust area.,62187,3
62188,"The clip is fine...didn't realize the company name was ""prominently displayed.""",62188,3
62189,Short legs ride up but overall good.,62189,3
62190,look different than picture shows.,62190,3
62190,have 2 pockets each side of hips,62190,3
62191,I'm normally a small/Medium.,62191,3
62191,The top fits great...,62191,3
62191,But the bottoms are SO small.,62191,3
62191,I just kept to mix and match top.,62191,3
62191,Too much of a hassle to return.,62191,3
62191,Wish the bottoms fit..the print is so cute and material is nicer than I expected,62191,3
62192,It's a nice bag for the size.,62192,3
62192,Thought it was larger when I ordered it for the beach.,62192,3
62192,Have found a use for it...still great for my cruise as a pool bag when you don't have to take as much with you.,62192,3
62193,It's stretchy and light but not breathable and doesn't look flow-y like it does in the picture.,62193,3
62193,Arrived early so that's good  but I was a little disappointed that it doesn't move the way the picture portrayed....,62193,3
62194,Based on the measurements to use for ordering I went with a medium/S6 and this was too small.,62194,3
62194,I'll be returning and getting the next size up.,62194,3
62195,Fits nothing like the model in the picture.,62195,3
62196,Fit is a bit smaller then expected,62196,3
62197,i liked it but when i take it off and try to make the cross it was kind of hard to put back to the original look i might be doing it wrong lol other than that its very pretty,62197,3
62198,Looks great turns skin green and plating falls off in 2 days.,62198,3
62198,Nice to have just don't wear it.,62198,3
62199,Ordered the Fox ring for my daughter for Christmas.,62199,3
62199,Did not get item pictured.,62199,3
62199,Ring does not have as much detail to it as the picture shows.,62199,3
62199,The ring pictured as the product has detail on the tail and face.,62199,3
62199,The ring I received is completely smooth.,62199,3
62199,"I have decided to go ahead and give it to her, but would have preferred to receive the item I thought I was buying.",62199,3
62199,"Also, did not come in a ring gift box.",62199,3
62199,Was packaged in a bag.,62199,3
62200,Not a normal sizes shirt,62200,3
62201,I was going to return but decided to keep as it fits with my tank tops.,62201,3
62202,its very pretty but he size is not correct the large is actually its strechable though,62202,3
62203,I ordered a small because it said it would be just a little bigger on my bust (I'm a 32D) and yeah...,62203,3
62203,It won't close around my chest.,62203,3
62204,Sleeves are way too long and don't stay up,62204,3
62205,Bought a two sizes larger and they were still to small.,62205,3
62205,No I'm not talking about my package I couldn't get them comfortable around my waste and because they fit so small the would ride up the back side to the point were I could make m work no mater how much the wiffy liked m.  The were very sexy and fun but I couldn't get them of fast enough.,62205,3
62205,However I will say the were of good quality and just for the fun factor my wife and I both wished they would have worked out.,62205,3
62205,"I'm medium build at 5'10"" and 180 lbs.",62205,3
62206,Beautiful dress but not for a short person.,62206,3
62206,"It is extremely long but I expected that, I had to get it altered.",62206,3
62207,It's so well made and has great storage.,62207,3
62207,But just too huge for my small frame.,62207,3
62207,"Being short waisted, this pretty much covers my entire middle area.",62207,3
62208,This would have been a five star rating if the sewing to line up the stripes were matched up.,62208,3
62208,Also the black thread hem looks a little tacky against the bottom stripe being that the bottom of the skirt ends in a white stripe but then has black thread running through it.,62208,3
62209,The product looks great it just doesn't fit,62209,3
62210,These fit small and pinch the nose quite a bit.,62210,3
62210,There is little room to stretch or bend them.,62210,3
62211,True to color however i had to adjust the dress for the perfect fit.,62211,3
62211,The dress does not fit all body types.,62211,3
62211,I will keep the dress but will need to adjust for the perfect fit.,62211,3
62212,Great for our family disney world trip.,62212,3
62212,"Had to use the hot glue gun to make a little stronger but it beats paying the 30$ for ears when you get to disney world, all our family was able to enjoy ears for a little more than what we would pay for the one pair there.",62212,3
62213,Must be ironed every time it's washed.,62213,3
62213,it barely fit's my 2 month old granddaughter.,62213,3
62215,I ordered this as my mom's mother of the bride dress in a 16 (she's a 14).,62215,3
62215,We like the dress but the sizing is small (I find that a lot with garments made in Asian countries!).,62215,3
62215,We returned it and ordered a larger size.,62215,3
62216,This skirt is a foot too long but very pretty,62216,3
62217,"Runs very small, rolls in the front if you have any sort of a pouch.",62217,3
62217,"If you have a tush, not so great on the coverage slops down.",62217,3
62218,Purchase a size larger than I normally wear and it was still too small.,62218,3
62218,After one washing the seams needed to be mended.,62218,3
62219,It made my breasts look strange.,62219,3
62219,Maybe if you have had breast enhancement surgery it my look better.,62219,3
62219,It did not look good on my natural breasts.,62219,3
62220,Took a few weeks.,62220,3
62220,I wish Amazon required notification when item comes from out of the US.,62220,3
62220,The outfit is ok in quality.,62220,3
62221,The underskirt rolled up every few seconds when walking....I found myself pulling down the underskirt multiple times throughout the night.,62221,3
62222,Runs big and I'm a size 2x....,62222,3
62223,"The skirt itself is cute BUT, when I received the skirt, the fabric looked as though it had been washed 5 times.",62223,3
62223,I tries ironing it but it was still wrinkly looking.,62223,3
62224,This did NOT come with the case!,62224,3
62224,the is why its a 4 star and not a 4. the quality was as expected cheap but can be over looked because of how many you get in the pack.,62224,3
62224,it did come with a lot of verity but now everything in the picture.,62224,3
62224,i did now count it yet but i will update this witha pick and how many do come in the bag.,62224,3
62225,the size said Junior but way too big for my daughter,62225,3
62226,Good product but sizes run small.,62226,3
62227,fits in the waist well but the pouch does not hold anything in place and the fabric looks good but I  like it more flexible or strachy,62227,3
62228,Bottoms fit but top is small!,62228,3
62228,Sad you can't get switched sizes,62228,3
62229,It's pretty but the zipper came broken...,62229,3
62230,"Nice shirt but too small, I don't think I'll buy anymore clothes on Amazon unless it's made in the USA",62230,3
62231,"The picture shows a variety of colors but it's clear, white, black, and champagne in color.",62231,3
62231,"Sadly I needed a belt to go with my navy blue dress for a wedding and couldn't use this belt, but it fits my natural and lower waist well so it will be used for other occasions.",62231,3
62232,Cap sleeves were fuller than expected.,62232,3
62233,Kids actually LOVE these helmets.,62233,3
62233,3 stars bc one of them arrived broken and we had to return it.,62233,3
62234,"Not as bright purple in person, very pretty sleeves though",62234,3
62235,I rated it in the middle because I am not keeping the bag.,62235,3
62235,I had wanted the brown one and received the black one.,62235,3
62235,"Since the color was wrong, I didn't do much inspecting of the bag.",62235,3
62235,"It did seem a bit stiff but I don't know if it just needs some ""breaking"" in",62235,3
62236,Just doesn't look like this,62236,3
62237,Bought this for my mom but it wasn't gentle on the hip area.,62237,3
62237,I had to return it for a flare style.,62237,3
62238,Even the large was way to small so I had to give it to my daughter.,62238,3
62238,If you are a size 12 don't bother buying this.,62238,3
62238,You need to be a 0 - 4.,62238,3
62238,I wish it fit.,62238,3
62239,very cute but way to small.,62239,3
62239,Need to post the sixes correctly.,62239,3
62240,These sunglasses are really cute but they are not comfortable to wear.,62240,3
62241,It is ok however even with I was still a size 1 this jacket would never fit as it is shown with a belt event the XL size which I ordered.,62241,3
62241,I now where a size 12 and the extra large fits small,62241,3
62242,The leaves are a bit tight in shoulders and arms.,62242,3
62242,I'm a 6 with medium blouse size.,62242,3
62242,Fit my neighbor just fine!,62242,3
62243,"Doesn't really look like the picture, and runs small.",62243,3
62243,"But I'm just using it for a Halloween costume, so for the price, I can't complain.",62243,3
62244,I usually wear M for my shirts and I ordered L because I wanted shirts to be little beggy.,62244,3
62244,But the abdomen area was tight.,62244,3
62244,Also the fabric was also little thin.,62244,3
62244,"Overall, i was a little disappointed.",62244,3
62245,If you have wide feet these may not be fore you.,62245,3
62245,"Unfortunately, I reached out to Archmolds and they indicated they do not make products for wide feet.",62245,3
62245,Some suggest getting a larger size to compensate for wide feet but be careful because that also means the midfoot part of the sole will be extended to far out from your actual midfoot thereby defeating the purpose of the insole stability features.,62245,3
62246,The quality was decent but highly overpriced in my opinion.,62246,3
62246,I returned this wallet.,62246,3
62247,The color is a little loud for my taste.,62247,3
62247,Fits in the hips.,62247,3
62247,The front is a little low in the 5X.,62247,3
62247,Washes up well and is warm.,62247,3
62248,The shirt is HUGE.,62248,3
62248,I bought the size I normally wear and it is a lot bigger.,62248,3
62249,"My wife bought this item; from what I heard, it's a bit too tight and it seems to be more cumbersome than comfortable...",62249,3
62250,I liked the shoes.,62250,3
62250,They were just 2 sizes too small.,62250,3
62251,cheap looking but I needed it for a costume party,62251,3
62252,"the ties felt a little cheap; however, that isn't the reason for three stars (the ties do their job).",62252,3
62252,I ordered a large and received a medium.,62252,3
62252,"I don't like the hassle of returning things, so it'll do.",62252,3
62252,"But, the large would have been perfect, and the medium is just a little less fabric than I was expecting (the girls are a little large and so the medium doesn't quite cover at all times)",62252,3
62253,Two sizes too small,62253,3
62254,This was rose gold and not yellow gold.,62254,3
62254,Stones were very shiny and beautiful... Metal could have been better...,62254,3
62255,Arms are a little tight but it's ok,62255,3
62256,I didn't like that you could t take a regular picture with a flash.,62256,3
62256,My whole picture turns pink.,62256,3
62257,The small loop that the straps attach/detach broke on the left side.,62257,3
62257,:( Oh well super glue shall fix it.,62257,3
62257,Be sides that fits fine and it's a nice suit.,62257,3
62258,"It fit fine in the legs, but I cannot pull the waist band up to where it's supposed to be.",62258,3
62258,"It does not go over my butt, which is on the large side, but it's not THAAAAAAAAT big.",62258,3
62258,"I have plenty of other similar leggings from other brands that I've purchased in this same size, and they fit fine.",62258,3
62258,"I am in the process of losing weight, so maybe this will help motivate me?",62258,3
62258,"Kind of.. whatever, but they look cool.",62258,3
62258,Can't wait to wear them some day!,62258,3
62259,I ordered this dress for my bridal shower.,62259,3
62259,I ordered this specific color due to the colors of my wedding (pink and red).,62259,3
62259,When i got this dress i was disappointed because the dress is really peach not pink.,62259,3
62259,"The fit is nice, it is a little big but it will work.",62259,3
62259,It is somewhat see through,62259,3
62260,"Beautiful dress, pretty fabric but the right underarm seam was not completely sewn and was frayed.",62260,3
62260,I sewed it myself and this dress is beautiful.,62260,3
62260,I get lots of compliments.,62260,3
62261,Cute for the price.,62261,3
62261,The enamel does come off eventually and cause some skin irritation.,62261,3
62261,Applying a coat of clear nail polish to the back of the galaxy piece helps protect against that.,62261,3
62262,"Great looking shirt, you may want to consider buying two sizes larger.",62262,3
62263,It was good enough for the day.,62263,3
62263,Ran a little small.,62263,3
62263,Side string came out on the first day.,62263,3
62263,Shorts were not flattering.,62263,3
62264,Great for the price!,62264,3
62265,Price reflects the quality.,62265,3
62265,"But I needed the top for the home with button up, and this one was very good for this purpose.",62265,3
62265,It is also doesn't fit as tight as in the picture.,62265,3
62265,And neckline is higher than on the picture,62265,3
62266,I would recommend going up a size,62266,3
62267,This dress is adorable but the front is much much shorter than the back of the dress.,62267,3
62267,I'll most likely have to wear leggings with it which is absolutely not the look I was going for.,62267,3
62268,Is a little smaller than I expected it's hard to read but overall it's good for the price,62268,3
62269,Very nice coat just not true to American size,62269,3
62270,The outfit was too small based on the sizes on chart.,62270,3
62271,I ordered a size up and it was still too small so order a size or two up (particularly if you're a busty girl).,62271,3
62271,The material was fine but it was the wrong color.,62271,3
62271,The grey came and was more of an olive color.,62271,3
62272,My husband is a Cole Haan lover so he had to try these.,62272,3
62272,"They're a neat fabric, kind of like canvas.",62272,3
62272,But the stitching reminded me of jeans...so he's wearing jean shoes with jeans.,62272,3
62272,It was a bit too much denim for my taste and let's face it ladies....our husband's wear what we like.,62272,3
62272,They're also a bit more narrow looking than he liked - too pointy for our tastes.,62272,3
62272,"Had they been a sale price, they're worth keeping but not so much for the Cole Haan price.",62272,3
62272,So we exchanged these for the Cole Haan Grand Pro Tennis Blazer in Blue - much better look with jeans and shorts.,62272,3
62273,I wouldn't recommend if you've got a large rear end.,62273,3
62273,I do and it doesn't exactly cover 100% :/,62273,3
62275,This bag is too cute & $24!,62275,3
62275,It presents itself as a real leather bag.,62275,3
62275,The color is just as you see it which they called camel however it's a definite a cognac color.,62275,3
62275,The brass tone pieces look okay for them to be colored plastic.,62275,3
62275,"The only pieces that  look real cheap are the two clips that clip the long strap on to the bag The inside liner has three pockets; 1 zipper pouch, 2 cell phone type pockets & the material is cheap and for see it ripping if this was a main bag.",62275,3
62275,I will add the feet & replace the clips.,62275,3
62275,Then it will look like $100 bag.,62275,3
62276,They were longer than expected so I had to hem them.,62276,3
62277,I like the top.,62277,3
62277,It's listed as a sweater but is more like a shirt.,62277,3
62277,It's thin but def smaller than what is in the pic.,62277,3
62277,"I do like it though, it's just not what I expected.",62277,3
62278,This is nice but it is too hard and won't flex with my wrist.,62278,3
62279,soooo small that I could barely stretch them out to fit into my earlobes.,62279,3
62280,Gave this as a gift for my 6 foot 1 inch tall husband.,62280,3
62280,Got it in large and it fit well at first.,62280,3
62280,"Then we washed it and it shrank up so small, I thought it looked rediculous and we would have to take it back.",62280,3
62280,But the material is tricky.,62280,3
62280,I ironed it out and the crinkly material slowly gave and stretched back flat to its original shape.,62280,3
62280,"However, it is synthetic material and after reading other reviews that indicated it would not shrink I bought it.",62280,3
62280,I bought one in black and one in grey.,62280,3
62280,"Once ironed, it appears they may have shrunk about 1.5 inches in length on the shorts and on the sleeves.",62280,3
62280,It seemed to shrink up in the length about 3 inches!,62280,3
62280,"But again, I had to work with the material and iron it out.",62280,3
62280,The pretty threading detail on the upper arm shrinks up quite a bit and loses its shape.,62280,3
62280,My husband wore it for a while around the house and said it fit okay once it began to relax.,62280,3
62280,"If I had known, I probably would have ordered an extra large.",62280,3
62280,Then it would fit like a large without all the ironing fuss.,62280,3
62280,"Hopefully in spring when it warms up, we can really see how these things wear.",62280,3
62281,"It is pretty, but the quality is not great.",62281,3
62282,the blouse its beautifull but it was too tight!,62282,3
62282,had to fixed it,62282,3
62283,I wear wigs all of the time.,62283,3
62283,The hair looks like it came from a Barbie doll.,62283,3
62283,It has an unnatural sheen and the part is EXTREMELY obvious.,62283,3
62284,Super cute but more of a midi ring.,62284,3
62284,Bought as a gift so I didn't mess around too much with the fit.,62284,3
62285,The shoes were good and looked exactly as they did in the pictures.,62285,3
62285,They were a little small for my daughters feet who normally wears a 13 and I totally understand that they don't make yeezys this small..so I'm very happy to have them.,62285,3
62285,Great job thank you.,62285,3
62287,"This is a nice clip, but I needed it to be just a little longer.",62287,3
62288,doesn't have the quality shown in the photo - more red than burgundy red,62288,3
62289,The coat ran too small for me to wear.,62289,3
62289,Gifted it to my Granddaughter and she loved it.,62289,3
62290,This is a beautiful dress.,62290,3
62290,But the back of the dress is not cut high as in the picture.,62290,3
62290,The dress I received has a low scooped back.,62290,3
62291,The hand gloves were not the one shown in the photo.,62291,3
62292,Didn't buy very long ago but they already look like hand me downs.,62292,3
62293,Black legging is perfect.,62293,3
62293,Red one is too loose.,62293,3
62293,"However, I don't plan on wearing them for long so they should work.",62293,3
62294,The bathing suit is super cute but the bra cups are so stiff!,62294,3
62294,Needless to say I will not be taking this one with me on vacation.,62294,3
62295,As bright as it is on the screen but HUGE!,62295,3
62295,"I ordered a Medium, and i wear a usual Medium in US.",62295,3
62295,I should have gone w a small.,62295,3
62295,Too bad bc color and material is nice for price!,62295,3
62296,Somewhat small otherwise it's cute.,62296,3
62296,Size does not accurately reflect that is why I only gave 3 stars.,62296,3
62297,"This is so incredibly bright looking at the pictures it looked more like a coral and is huge but in only 5'2"" but larger busted, it is made nicely but the slip is soooo short.",62297,3
62297,I am going to try to dye it this weekend.,62297,3
62297,For $7 I'm not too pressed about it but won't be buying from China again.,62297,3
62298,Too small and the white parts of suit are see-through,62298,3
62299,definitely not what i expected.,62299,3
62301,Large was more of a Medium.,62301,3
62301,I don't own anything Large but was warned that anything from China would run small so I went with large.,62301,3
62302,I was pretty disappointed when I first recieved this.,62302,3
62302,I didn't check the other reviews very well so I didn't realize how thin and see through the material was.,62302,3
62302,That was the problem for me.,62302,3
62302,"I was in early 3rd trimester of pregnancy when I wanted to wear this and it fit over my belly with no problem and no further impact on its see through issue, luckily.",62302,3
62302,"It did make the dress more of a long shirt than a dress tho, barely covering my crotch.",62302,3
62302,"My fiance, now husband, and I decided kind of last minute that we didn't want to wait for a more ""perfect"" time to tie the knot.",62302,3
62302,"Keeping it simple, low cost and more sentimental became our bigger goal.",62302,3
62302,I managed to make this work by pairing it with a long flowery white flowing skirt that I had in my closet and a white sheer lace dress that I also ordered from Amazon.,62302,3
62303,I liked them but they were too small.,62303,3
62304,The front is a little shorter than in the picture but overall it's a cute and comfortable top.,62304,3
62305,Very cute and comfortable gloves.,62305,3
62305,"However, the touch fingertips stopped working and the stitching became a little ripped after a couple weeks of moderate wear.",62305,3
62305,"I wanted to return them, but customer service declined it for some reason.",62305,3
62305,"No big deal considering how cheap these gloves are, though.",62305,3
62305,"Then customer service in broken English offered to send a new pair, but I declined, doubting the quality would be any better.",62305,3
62305,"Next time I want gloves for touch screen, I'll have to invest a little more money into another brand.",62305,3
62307,Advertised as adjustable but it's not.,62307,3
62307,I fashioned an adjustable cord from some brown leather shoelaces.,62307,3
62307,I especially like the spikes used for the cross.,62307,3
62307,i would have given it 5 stars if it was adjutable.,62307,3
62307,"If you're looking for a choker, then this will work just fine.",62307,3
62308,Jacket is big like extra large ...,62308,3
62308,Shorts fit but are way smaller than the jacket fits like its medium.,62308,3
62310,I returned this dress.,62310,3
62310,"I ordered a medium (usually dress size 5-6) i'm 5'5"", dress was really short, don't bend over short.",62310,3
62310,"The arms were a little tight, but not a big issue because the fabric stretches a lot.",62310,3
62310,"The dress could be used as a tunic, but it's just not very cute, cheap thin fabric.",62310,3
62311,If this bathing suit had more support for my 36 g size I would've definitely kept it.,62311,3
62311,The material is a pretty decent quality feels a little cheap but nothing to complain about.,62311,3
62311,I bought a size 12 and it fit perfectly except the boob area as mentioned.,62311,3
62311,I'm usually a 12/14 also it stretches pretty well.,62311,3
62312,"I'm a 32, using these for sleeping wish I went to next size",62312,3
62313,"Some of these were too small, others OK.  Nice variety and material.",62313,3
62314,it's an ok casual dress,62314,3
62315,I would like to start with the sizing.,62315,3
62315,"I typically wear a medium jacket so when I read the measurements in the description, I realized the sizing is a little off, I ordered the Asia xxl (us L) and it fits nice.",62315,3
62315,Just be aware of that.,62315,3
62315,"Next, I will cover the look and feel.",62315,3
62315,"It is a nice looking  ""jacket"".",62315,3
62315,"The reason I quoted the word jacket is because it will never, and I mean never, keep you warm.",62315,3
62315,Its only purpose is to be fashionable.,62315,3
62315,It is very thin so it's perfect for spring and possibly a cool summer day.,62315,3
62315,It looks alot thicker in the picture.,62315,3
62315,You will also never convince anyone that its real leather either.,62315,3
62315,"Overall, I would have givin this jacket a 3 1/2 star rating.",62315,3
62315,"Looks great, fits nice, but just doesn't quite have the feel.",62315,3
62315,I am interested in seeing how long this jacket will hold up.,62315,3
62316,It slides around- I have to re-adjust it constantly.,62316,3
62317,I don't like the one size fits most.,62317,3
62317,I would like an actual size option.,62317,3
62318,seems a bit on the small size for a 2xl,62318,3
62319,"It's gray, not lavender....sad, but it will look ok with gray clothes.",62319,3
62320,This necklace is much smaller than it looks in the photos from the seller.,62320,3
62320,"It is not as wide as it looks and the chain in the back is short  It is also shiny, so does not look very ""bohemian.""",62320,3
62320,If I hadn't accidentally thrown away the packaging I would be returning this since I am not sure I will wear it.,62320,3
62321,These are okay ... but they are not soft.,62321,3
62321,I'm hoping the soften up and shrink a little when washed.,62321,3
62321,I'll update after I wash them.,62321,3
62322,Nice warm gloves but they run very large!,62322,3
62322,I've been using them for me instead of my 3 yo!,62322,3
62323,The quality is not awesome but for the price they work great.,62323,3
62325,very cheaply made and too small.... need to buy 2-3 sizes bigger.,62325,3
62325,:(  pretty design though.,62325,3
62326,They are a bit on the small side,62326,3
62327,Silver finish wore off!,62327,3
62328,"Pretty ring, girlfriend loved it but a few weeks after receiving it one of the stones fell out.",62328,3
62328,But for the price I can order another one.,62328,3
62328,Over all you know it's not a high quality ring but for everyday wear it is pretty.,62328,3
62329,"High low, which isn't my favorite.",62329,3
62329,Plus the shirt is sheer.,62329,3
62329,Still can be cute!,62329,3
62329,But not what I expected from pictured.,62329,3
62329,I'm still happy with it though,62329,3
62330,It was really beautiful but it was way to small and it wouldn't fit the monofin,62330,3
62331,Was nice  on the picture look so big thanks,62331,3
62332,"It's okay, but considering price, it's prob.",62332,3
62333,"The fit on the waist is a bit tight, but not where it is uncomfortable.",62333,3
62333,It flares and puffs beautifully.,62333,3
62333,The print and color is awesome.,62333,3
62333,"I loved the criss corss back, but unfortunately, the top part was too big (especially under the arm).",62333,3
62333,I am a 36c and I bought this in size Lg.,62333,3
62333,Not sure if I would have gotten a medium size see that the lg size is a bit snug on the waistline.,62333,3
62334,"I like the size, but it looked much better in the picture.",62334,3
62334,I'll find a use for this.,62334,3
62335,Pretty but for plus size... read carefully,62335,3
62336,Cute but cheap looking,62336,3
62337,Very casual relaxing wear.,62337,3
62338,Beautiful sweater but runs really small.,62338,3
62339,This bathing suit looks like the picture besides the fact that the front is a VERY deep V. If you have really narrow hips it would look good on you.,62339,3
62339,Not for curvy women.,62339,3
62339,"Ordered a small and besides the deep v, it fits well.",62339,3
62339,Almost no breast support.,62339,3
62340,This item works well but it's not easy taking the watch in and out.,62340,3
62341,This is made for tall slender women not for others.,62341,3
62341,I ordered a much bigger size.,62341,3
62341,Quality was good but because size didn't seem true I rated 3.,62341,3
62342,I'm voting for Trump.,62342,3
62342,His campaign shirts are pricey this one was cheap.,62342,3
62342,Its slim on me but I like it.,62342,3
62342,"I got large I'm 6'5"" and 3% body fat.",62342,3
62342,It's a good shirt.,62342,3
62344,I am exchanging the dress for a larger size.,62344,3
62344,I went based off of the measurements and the dress was too tight.,62344,3
62344,"The quality suggests that this will be a quick rotation and will not hold up for many wears, but I think for the price and style this is good value.",62344,3
62345,It runs super small but that was expected.,62345,3
62345,I still love it!,62345,3
62346,not shaped very well - can't use together - I might use as separate pieces.,62346,3
62347,wasn't to impressed with this when it arrived but it wasn't expensive,62347,3
62349,it was tight across the front.,62349,3
62349,I had to stretch it,62349,3
62350,Large for a women's small face.,62350,3
62351,A little too dark but excellent quality,62351,3
62352,"It works as designed, could use a bit more capacity.",62352,3
62353,Single-line stitching in a lot of places tell me it's going to fall apart after a few washes.,62353,3
62353,"It looks good at a glance, and if you don't intend to wear it often then it may work well for you, but despite being made with decent material and an aesthetic design there is a major lack of craftsmanship here.",62353,3
62353,"The fabric is of medium weight, suitable if you don't run or jump, just make sure to wear a sporran so the wind doesn't flip your kilt.",62353,3
62353,"Furthermore, it is suggested to order 2 sizes larger than your pant size, but unless you've got a well-invested beer gut the kilt will be too big.",62353,3
62353,I wear an awkward 35.,62353,3
62353,That means 34's don't quite fit right and 36's are a bit loose.,62353,3
62353,"I ordered a 40 figuring I could just cinch it up a little, but even after adjusting the built-in belts to the tightest level couldn't keep the kilt around my waist.",62353,3
62353,"I mean I like easy access, but this is ridiculous.",62353,3
62353,Even using a belt of my own crunches up the kilt in a very obvious way.,62353,3
62353,"TL;DR: If you're slim, athletic, or even mildly fit, don't order two sizes up.",62353,3
62353,"5/5 design, 2/5 craftsmanship",62353,3
62354,More pretty in the picture then in person,62354,3
62355,"Based on reviews and what I've observed about Oriental made clothing, I ordered size 8, one size larger than what I normally wear.",62355,3
62355,"(I'm 5'5"", 130 lb)
Should've ordered my normal size 6...or even a 4.",62355,3
62355,"The dress is large on me, sliding off one shoulder or the other; nearly dragging the ground.",62355,3
62355,"The material is somewhat shiny; a ""pattern"" like linen, but you know it's not ... rather like cheap sheer curtain material.",62355,3
62355,"It's a double layer of fabric though, so the dress isn't see through.",62355,3
62355,The fabric also snags rather easily.,62355,3
62355,"All that being said, it's cool (even with the 3/4 sleeves), comfortable and perfect for what I bought it for...lounging and light yard/garden work.",62355,3
62355,"If I had bought the proper size, it would work for casual wear outside the home as well.",62355,3
62355,"I've washed the dress, and dried in the dryer on normal heat, several times without shrinkage or wrinkling (wish it HAD shrunk :))
Update: Even though this dress fits loosely with no strain on sleeve seams, both back seams are starting to pull apart.",62355,3
62355,The fabric is just coming apart.,62355,3
62355,This after only a couple months and not an excessive amount of usage or washing.,62355,3
62355,I've readjusted my rating from 4 to 3 stars.,62355,3
62356,The lenses are plastic and very flimsy.,62356,3
62356,When the package arrived one of the lenses had popped out of the frame.,62356,3
62356,Fortunately I was able to bend the lens enough to fix it without having to send it back.,62356,3
62357,The shirt I purchased fits how I like it.,62357,3
62357,But I purchased this shirt because I like the arbor logo in the colors.,62357,3
62357,The shirt I got was the same colors but no arbor logo like the pic showed..,62357,3
62357,I guess they decided to send what they thought I wanted.,62357,3
62357,After looking the shirt I decided to keep it.,62357,3
62357,"The softness of these shirts is amazing, so comfortable.",62357,3
62357,Maybe next time I'll get what I want.,62357,3
62358,This tank top runs smaller than I thought it would.,62358,3
62358,"It's a big snug, but I still rock it.",62358,3
62359,"I ordered larger (2 sizes up), as suggested by other reviews and it was still snug.",62359,3
62359,I ended up having to cut the bottoms and sheer (around the belly area) from under the swimsuit and just bought a pair of regular bottoms to go with it.,62359,3
62359,That made it fit so much better and made a nice swimsuit after that.,62359,3
62359,I'm only 5'3.5'' and the underneath was just too short for me to wear it out in public (the bottoms that are made into the inside didn't cover but half of my buttocks!),62359,3
62360,"Super cute dress but it does not look expensive, but for the price is worth it.",62360,3
62360,"I wear at night so the details do not show so much, but it's very cute.",62360,3
62360,The dress is also very short.,62360,3
62360,I am 5.6 and I ordered M. I usually wear a little short underneath just in case.,62360,3
62361,Too small for a smart phone.,62361,3
62363,If you head is larger that 7 1/4 look elsewhere,62363,3
62364,Nicely packaged but very tiny and cheap looking.,62364,3
62365,"I am small 5' 6""  and even that it is too small for me.",62365,3
62365,the sleeve is too short and your untanned arm exposed,62365,3
62366,Pretty but xl to small had to give it away unfortunately.,62366,3
62367,I ordered based on the sizing chart and this item was far too big for me.,62367,3
62367,"I ordered a size 12US and should have gone with a 10, which is what I usually am.",62367,3
62367,"I am 5'5"", 150lbs, 34DD chest size (which is why it recommended the larger size).",62367,3
62367,I am returning it as it does not fit properly and do not know if I will reorder the right size.,62367,3
62367,The fabric is soft and the colors are beautiful.,62367,3
62367,"It is also VERY low cut, and I usually do not have a problem with low cut items.",62367,3
62368,Good fit but the colors is not as vibrant as they are in the pic.,62368,3
62369,"After all the trouble of finally getting it shipped(they had the wrong address) and looking over the dress, it was not sewn on one side, the pearls were not straight, and it was missing several hooks.",62369,3
62369,Had to take it to an alteration shop to be fixed(extra money spent for me).,62369,3
62369,"Over all I was very disappointed with the quality, but after having it fixed it fit great and was a hit!",62369,3
62370,This dress is so soft and feminine but runs extremely large.,62370,3
62370,I am a size M but ordered a size S based on the size chart...,62370,3
62370,"If I decide to keep, I will have to plan a trip to my tailor!",62370,3
62370,I am 5'3 weigh 128 wear a size 36c or d bra and I'm very hippy with smallish waist.,62370,3
62371,This veil is very low quality.,62371,3
62371,However I did wear it after trimming many strings off and gluing the lace onto the veil in places it was coming off.,62371,3
62373,I bought two of these for my flower girls in my wedding.,62373,3
62373,When they arrived I didn't realize how long this hair decoration really is.,62373,3
62373,It seems like it can wrap around the back of the head instead of go on the side.,62373,3
62373,The jewels are very pretty and reflect light in a non-annoying way.,62373,3
62373,The pearls are also a very nice touch.,62373,3
62373,"The girls had shorter hair so, unfortunately, they chose to wear different headpieces instead of this one.",62373,3
62373,I think it's better suited to adults with medium-long length hair especially since it's slightly on the heavy side and will need pins to hold it down.,62373,3
62374,Fits a little snug at the top....,62374,3
62375,Bought 2 packs but some of them are smaller in width even though size # is same on all.,62375,3
62376,"This is my daughters favorite shirt, but it's a bit thin, almost see through.",62376,3
62376,"And just like the jacket, it would have been nice if it had ""FNAF"" on it.",62376,3
62377,I think this is not a bathing suits or for go to the beach because is not type of material,62377,3
62379,"To small
5'1 155 lbs
But it was very pretty !",62379,3
62379,I wished it was a bigger size,62379,3
62380,so I'm 5'8 110lbs ordered a small and the sleeves are no where near long enough.,62380,3
62380,If I wear the shirt it will have to be with the sleeves pulled up all the time.,62380,3
62380,It was also to short and if i try to tuck it into a pair of dress pants then when i lean over it pulls out from the back side immediately.,62380,3
62380,I'll wear it ever so often to small occasions when I'm not in it long but other than that it's not really a decent fitting work shirt.,62380,3
62381,"I bought this for my daughter, and she loves that she can see through it while keeping dry.",62381,3
62381,"However, the plastic sticks to itself, causing the metal ribs to break.",62381,3
62381,"One rib broke, and one poked a hole in the plastic.",62381,3
62381,"Love the idea, but there has got to be a way to keep the plastic from sticking to itself (we live in an arid climate, so humidity is not the cause).",62381,3
62382,"The bust is small, had to give to my niece.",62382,3
62383,"Really the only black, plain hat & gloves combo I could find in the right size through Amazon prime.",62383,3
62383,"It's good for cold weather, but not too much for snow for an active child.",62383,3
62383,"It will keep them warm and it looks good, but it's not water proof, and they get wet.",62383,3
62383,"If you are just trying to keep your kid warm, this is what you are looking for.",62383,3
62383,"I was looking for snow gloves for our 2 year old, I'll look for some kind of water proof glove next time.",62383,3
62384,I'm 5'9 about  145-150lbs ; I usually wear a 9/11 or 30 depending on the brand  i ordered the XL.,62384,3
62384,the shorts fit but they're too tight for my liking.,62384,3
62384,Great material and good quality but unfortunately didn't fit like I thought.,62384,3
62385,The sleeves are shorter than in the photographs.,62385,3
62385,Almost more of a cap sleeve than an elbow sleeve.,62385,3
62385,This happens a lot in plus size clothes where the sleeve isn't cut and sown as a separate piece.,62385,3
62386,I like this necklace!,62386,3
62386,It is pretty but I wish it was longer.,62386,3
62386,It measures at about 10 inches with the clasp at the longest spot.,62386,3
62386,The charm is about 2 and a half inches.,62386,3
62386,I wanted a longer necklace to wear with tee shirt dresses.,62386,3
62386,It is very pretty just not what I wanted.,62386,3
62387,I bought an XXL thinking this dress was the same as another seller's who run way too small.,62387,3
62387,But they're not the same.,62387,3
62387,"This is a true XXL, and I will have to take it in.",62387,3
62387,The only thing I didn't like was the insignia.,62387,3
62387,It's not quite right.,62387,3
62389,My daughter loves them.,62389,3
62389,I only wish they had a little thicker padding in the sole of them.,62389,3
62389,There isn't much padding and the padding they do use is pretty flimsy.,62389,3
62389,If they used better padding I would totally recommend these to everyone.,62389,3
62389,As is they are okay.,62389,3
62390,"somewhat small, I weigh 170 lbs and I ordered a XL.",62390,3
62391,"The swimsuit itself was decent, the color was nice and it looked to be fairly well made, However I had to return it because it evidently runs really small.",62391,3
62391,"I bought it the same size as my other bathing suits (all size 8) and which all fit me fine, but this one was way, way too small.",62391,3
62391,"I'm barely 5'5"" but the torso length on it was really short, like for someone maybe 5'2"" tall, and it was uncomfortably tight.",62391,3
62391,"The suit would probably have fit a much smaller person with a shorter torso and a 30-31"" bust, probably a size 4, maybe a 6 if they were a small 6.",62391,3
62393,I bought this along with the Flower Petals 16g Septum Clicker from the same company.,62393,3
62393,"I have yet to even wear this Tribal Swirl one, as I am having the same problem as with the former.",62393,3
62393,"They're both beautiful, but it took me 10 minutes & a pair of needle nose pliers to even open up the Flower  Petal Septum Clicker & opening the package of this one, this is also nearly impossible to open.",62393,3
62393,"Once the former was in my nose, it got stuck & took me days of trying & a swollen septum hole before I was able to get it out.",62393,3
62393,"I am hoping it will loosen up, but as it is right now, it's unwearable.",62393,3
62394,"Quick shipping, however I have no clue on what is each function.",62394,3
62394,No directions or Labels on any of the 5 individual bags.,62394,3
62396,Fangs look good but did not come with the molding compound!!,62396,3
62396,Now I will have to order that separate..It states that it is included!!,62396,3
62397,It's worth the price but not any more than that.,62397,3
62397,GMC logo is just a cheap iron on like they used in the 1970's.,62397,3
62397,"My GMC patch is way too high, nearly up to the neck.",62397,3
62397,GMC stuff is hard to find so I took a chance on the only hoodie I found.,62397,3
62397,"Again, barely worth it.",62397,3
62398,"RUNS BIG...Decent quality for what I expected- I guess, still not sure if it's worth price though.",62398,3
62398,I followed the sizing chart & it was way to big for me.,62398,3
62398,I'd look @ the sizing chart & order the size smaller than it recommends.,62398,3
62398,According to the sizing chart I'd be a size medium.,62398,3
62398,"Medium was way to big, small would of probably fit perfect.",62398,3
62398,"And the fabric has give some give (stretch) to it, so that should ease your mind if you choose to follow my recommendation of ordering a size smaller than the sizing chart says",62398,3
62399,"a bit small but ok because is automatic, that makes diference",62399,3
62400,I always get compliments when I wear it.,62400,3
62400,"I love the design on the shirt and the silky feel, but it's way too easily snagged.",62400,3
62400,Still worth the buy just not for an everyday wear.,62400,3
62401,This was a nice bag and it had alot of pockets.,62401,3
62401,It seemed to be a good size for an over the shoulder purse but it just wasn't what I was looking for so I sent it back.,62401,3
62402,It was like a young kid size...but returned with no hassle.,62402,3
62403,"Just came today, and was so excited to open it.",62403,3
62403,It's the wrong color!,62403,3
62403,"I ordered black, and this is navy.",62403,3
62403,"Also, the sizing says 0-12m, when the tag reads:12m.",62403,3
62403,"So, this is much lager than I was expecting.",62403,3
62403,"I was going to use it for a Halloween costume, but now can't.",62403,3
62403,"It's very lovely, though.",62403,3
62403,"The entire piece is lined in the fuzzy fur, sleeves, legs, bodice, all of it lined.",62403,3
62403,I am thinking I'll keep it and use it on cold nights at the beach.,62403,3
62403,Photo with black remote for color reference.,62403,3
62404,"Well made, comfy but too small.",62404,3
62405,"This is a super cute top, good quality for the price.",62405,3
62405,"However, it's one size fits all...or most.",62405,3
62405,"This doesn't make any sense, considering that the fabric has zero stretch to it.",62405,3
62405,I wish I could keep it but it's fits more like a very fitted top than what's pictured.,62405,3
62405,"For reference, I'm a size 8 and typically a medium in tops.",62405,3
62406,Not as detailed as the picture indicated.,62406,3
62406,"Cute, but not exactly what I was expecting.",62406,3
62406,Not really worth what I paid for it.,62406,3
62407,"I bought this looking for more of a loose tee shirt dress, but it came and it hugs my butt/thighs quite a bit.",62407,3
62407,"I'm 5'2, 125lbs, & a 34c.",62407,3
62407,"The construction is nice, but the fabric is like workout fabric- sort of silky, not cotton-esque at all.",62407,3
62407,"It doesn't hug my stomach, which I like and the sleeves are a good length.",62407,3
62407,Just not sure about it yet.,62407,3
62408,It was too small and short!,62408,3
62409,"The bottoms of this suit fit me, but the top does not.",62409,3
62409,"Now, that's not anyone's fault, because I'm a bit chesty.",62409,3
62409,"The top isn't supportive at all, which will be fine for someone who doesn't need it.",62409,3
62409,"The color looks kind of blue in this picture, but the suit is black with pink polka dots and really cute!",62409,3
62409,"I'm bummed it doesn't fit, but my friend will be happy, because I'm going to send it to her.",62409,3
62409,":)

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review, which I have given.",62409,3
62410,It ok. Not what I was  expecting,62410,3
62411,"The fit is fine, but ours arrived with a small black mark near the bottom.",62411,3
62411,"It looked like something had just, rubbed it (even though it was in plastic wrap), so I thought it might wash out.",62411,3
62411,Clothing should never make it into packaging if there is a mark/stain.,62411,3
62412,Nice material but it runs large.,62412,3
62412,I bought the 3X and I feel like I;m swimming in it even though that's the size I wear.,62412,3
62413,I ordered a size larger than my normal and it was still on the smaller side.,62413,3
62413,"The chest area doesn't fit awesome if your chest is larger (which... hello, pregnancy), but all in all it's a keeper cause of the price and the comfort level.",62413,3
62413,I put a jean jacket over it and got a number of compliments in fact.,62413,3
62413,"Not sure I'll buy any more of the colors, but I'm sure this one will get heavy rotation during these hot summer months.",62413,3
62414,The top is way too big,62414,3
62415,Great for travel because it's very small.,62415,3
62416,They are as described.,62416,3
62416,"Very flexible; makes them feel a little cheap, but they work just fine.",62416,3
62416,"I tried them on and they don't SEEM polarized, but I couldn't prove it.",62416,3
62417,"nice pants, don't fit correctly, and wrong cut.",62417,3
62418,I like the jeans and the look but wouldn't really consider them to be low rise but mid rise.,62418,3
62418,Don't like my belt to be that high because it causes a bulge when my shirt has to be pulled down over it.,62418,3
62419,Was disappointed because I thought they would be all fleece.,62419,3
62420,The picture makes it look shorter than it really is,62420,3
62421,"I noticed that most all of the reviews had received the tie clips in return for an ""unbiased"" review.",62421,3
62421,These are heavy tie claps that are very nice looking.,62421,3
62421,They are too heavy to work well in holding your tie in place.,62421,3
62421,They slip and barely hang onto the tie or fall off.,62421,3
62421,I have over 400 ties and I have many claps.,62421,3
62421,None of my other tie clasps are nearly this heavy..,62421,3
62421,They should have a more rugged spring to hold them or they should be lighter.,62421,3
62421,The seller was excellent in taking them back.,62421,3
62422,underlying material is too artificial for the skin.,62422,3
62422,If you have sensitive skin it won't feel nice.,62422,3
62423,I live in Michigan and take my dog to the dog park a few days a week.,62423,3
62423,I need gloves to keep my fingers warm for 45 minutes to 1 hour.,62423,3
62423,I wore these gloves yesterday for the first time and in 26 degree weather after 15-20 minutes my fingers were freezing.,62423,3
62423,I got a size medium according to the chart and they are on the big side.,62423,3
62423,I am giving 3 stars because maybe they are ineffective because because the are too large for me.,62423,3
62424,Overall the jacket is nice but unfortunately the arm parts didn't fit.,62424,3
62424,The sleeves are too skinny for the size.,62424,3
62424,I bought a size large but the sleeves felt like they were small or medium.,62424,3
62424,The jacket did not fit.,62424,3
62426,The material is strechy but too snugly,62426,3
62427,Its just to small.,62427,3
62427,If purchasing size up.,62427,3
62428,It was too short!,62428,3
62428,Maybe I just have a long torso but it unsnap every time I raised my arms.,62428,3
62428,Its super cute so this is really disappoointing.,62428,3
62428,Returning is a hassle with nonprime items so in the end I just kept it.,62428,3
62428,(And never raise my arms while wearing it sigh),62428,3
62429,Arrived on time .,62429,3
62429,"It is for sure a Very small hat, cute but wish it was bigger.",62429,3
62430,Pendant solid & nice but the chain broke as soon as my daughter put it on!,62430,3
62431,Shirt was cute but it was to small,62431,3
62432,The shirt is... fobby  (weird English).,62432,3
62432,My fault for not reading more closely.,62432,3
62432,I wish it was a little longer in the back for me.,62432,3
62432,The material is a little sweaty feeling for me but I'm glad it's a nursing shirt.,62432,3
62433,Jacket size appeared to run large.,62433,3
62434,"I ordered the black, royal blue and white hat.",62434,3
62434,The black and blue are fine but the white hat came with a smudge on it.,62434,3
62434,Not big but noticeable.,62434,3
62435,faded quickly with washing.,62435,3
62438,"Good price, a lot loss hairs, still not able to wear it until hair stop falling?",62438,3

62440,"This looks nice in the picture, but I did not like when I wear.",62440,3
62440,"my size is usually small, but I look fat to wear this top.",62440,3
62440,I forgot to refund...,62440,3
62443,It was somewhat small in length but the waist was big-WIDE- not snug and fitting like pictured.,62443,3
62443,Was not very flattering as the mid section was loose which left a boxy look,62443,3
62444,I really want to like this suit!,62444,3
62444,"It's really cute, however, the bottom part (brown material) is tight around the legs and doesn't flatter if you have any pudge between your hips (as I do).",62444,3
62444,"Also, the crotch rolls inside out when you walk.",62444,3
62444,Not sure what that's all about.,62444,3
62444,"The top is really cute, and could possibly drape down to cover some of the bottom, but I felt that it more ballooned out, making me feel bigger.",62444,3
62444,"The back is wide open down to the top of the butt, so if you have any problem with your back being bare, this is not the suit for you.",62444,3
62444,"I'm going to keep it as I'm in the process of losing weight, so I'll try it on again once I've lost a little weight.",62444,3

62445,"They were ok, WAY too small.",62445,3
62445,I ordered a size up based on the other size complaints and couldn't even get them past my thighs.,62445,3
62445,They were also pretty smelly.,62445,3
62445,"But the material seemed fine, I would have kept them if they fit.",62445,3
62445,Order two sizes up!,62445,3
62446,"I receive this, smaller then what I thought, nice for the price.",62446,3
62446,look nice with a short hair,62446,3
62448,While this top is beautiful and seems well made.,62448,3
62448,The sizing is off alot.,62448,3
62448,I ordered a 2x and it is the size of a women's medium at best.,62448,3
62448,"Luckily, I have skinny friends to give this too.",62448,3
62449,"Products were great, but there's some obvious issues, with stones you have to realize that both plugs won't be identical.",62449,3
62449,"Either one will be too bit or too long, or too small or too short, Atleast with my order they a bit too noticeable in difference.",62449,3
62449,"Only reason I didn't return the product was because two of the 3 pairs were manageable, the white ones tho, too too different.",62449,3
62449,"Again along with my other reviews, mystic metals needs to check over products before shipping.",62449,3
62449,"As for other buyers, be careful the product is great but the sizing is sometimes way off and you may need to return.",62449,3

62452,Skirt long and very flared.,62452,3
62453,Clasp broke first day.,62453,3
62453,Put a nicer one on and has been great since,62453,3
62454,It's adorable but it was too small for my nephew.,62454,3
62454,He was only two months when I gave it to him.,62454,3
62455,The sweatshirt was ok. My son didn't like how big the flag was on it.,62455,3
62455,He always wears a medium in sweatshirts and this was too small.,62455,3
62455,Ended up sending it back (at my own expense which was a lot because this company is halfway across the country from us).,62455,3
62455,Lost money on this one.,62455,3
62456,"Not bad for the price, but don't sit evenly on my face.",62456,3
62457,It is not an extra-large.,62457,3

62459,The pin fell out.,62459,3
62460,Lovely top way too small.,62460,3
62460,Gave my 22 yr old daughter,62460,3
62461,I wore it about a week then the treble clef fell off.,62461,3
62462,they are not what I would call oversized,62462,3
62467,I had to send back.,62467,3
62469,Bought for the wife and she didn't care much for them.,62469,3
62469,Maybe it's cuz her nipples weren't big enough.,62469,3

62470,"And, they're mirrored with UV 400so, theres a lot of protection there.",62470,3
62470,"These sunglasses aren't likely to stand up to a great deal of abuse, so youll need a case for them (not included); but, they're not expensive (< $10.00) so you won't be out a whole lot either way.",62470,3
62470,"Its good that they're adjustable, because they were pinching the crap out of my nose!",62470,3
62470,"Im being careful not to manipulate the frame too much, though.",62470,3
62470,Im pretty sure the bridge will become weak and break if its frequently adjusted.,62470,3
62471,"The belt is comfortable, looks and feels good, but after several weeks of use it is already showing signs of wear and tear.",62471,3
62471,And not in the good way a full grain leather belt should.,62471,3
62471,"The leather seems to be too soft and is dented where it hits the belt loops on pants, that's probably my biggest complaint.",62471,3
62471,After a few weeks I can tell those indentations are already permanent and will likely only get worse.,62471,3
62472,Very well made however I ordered a size medium  and it fits more like a big large I guess I'll pass it on along to someone else way to big for me,62472,3
62475,Can't how up to the pressure of multiple airline travels.,62475,3

62480,I got this as a maternity shirt and the fabric always sticks to the band of my maternity pants.,62480,3
62481,Got it for my boyfriend.,62481,3
62481,He loved it as much as I did.,62481,3

62484,has tight or narrow sleeves and that's uncomfortable to me,62484,3

62487,"I really like the shirt, unfortunately it's way too small.",62487,3
62487,"I wear an XL in most of my button down shirts, and L in the other few, so I didn't anticipate an issue ordering an XL.",62487,3
62487,The shirt fits as expected only across the top of the shoulders.,62487,3
62487,"Going down to the underarm area, it begins to get too small, and by the time you get below the chest it's completely stretched.",62487,3
62487,"I would describe the cut as a slim-fit, which I don't see anywhere in the product description.",62487,3
62488,Picture makes it look like it a women's cut but when it arrived it looked more like a boys cut.,62488,3
62491,"My wife seems to like it on me, but to me it is a cheap hat and looks and feels like a cheap hat.",62491,3
62491,It is and you get what you pay for.,62491,3
62491,After saying all of that it is well worth what it cost me.,62491,3

62493,"Also, the seam on the side ripped my third time wearing them.",62493,3
62493,"Luckily I know someone who can fix it for free, but this just shouldn't happen after only three wears!",62493,3
62495,my bobies are very large.,62495,3
62496,"Really like this piece, fits good, the clasps are kind of awkward though.",62496,3
62496,"They turn sideways, and the cloth attached to the wings on one side was kind of loose (is starting to come out of the tube) so I haven't worn it in a while.",62496,3
62496,"But other than that I loved the design, look, and feel of the bracelet.",62496,3
62497,Wasnt the same color in the picture and also fit a little to small.,62497,3
62497,But its still a cute dress.,62497,3
62498,"with that being said, it's see through.",62498,3
62498,"I honestly thought the material gave the illusion, but I was wrong and if you have big thighs, this dress would literally stop at the highest point of that thigh and best believe if you start walking, it would ride and stop at the cookies, if you get my drift.",62498,3
62498,"I'm 5'7, although I've been told 5'6 1/2, but there is no way this dress would stop AT or ABOVE the knee.",62498,3

62499,cute shirt but even though i bought large it was the size of a small.,62499,3
62500,Had to have the sleeves taken in as the shoulders fit perfectly.,62500,3
62501,Even has the etching on the sides which I like.,62501,3
62501,My only complaints is that I wish it could be adjusted smaller.,62501,3
62501,It's a little bit big and it swivels around my wrist.,62501,3
62501,If you have tiny wrists i wouldn't recommend.,62501,3
62501,It still gets the job done thiugh,62501,3
62502,These shoes are cute .... but they were to big and wide.,62502,3
62502,wore them around the house for about 30 minutes and my toes went numb.im a hairstylist and on my feet 10 hours a day .,62502,3
62502,Was so hoping these would work out and be comfortable .,62502,3
62502,Going to send them back .,62502,3
62502,Bought 3 pair in different colors.,62502,3
62502,Now back to searching for winter shoe with wedge heels!,62502,3
62503,Very pretty top and well made overall.,62503,3
62503,"It has a nice silky texture, is the right length, attractive buttons, bow as pictured, good stitching and looks expensive.",62503,3
62503,I do suggest wearing a camisole underneath as it is a bit thin-see through but not unduly so.,62503,3
62503,Does run small so if you have a full bust I suggest ordering two sizes up.,62503,3
62503,"I am a medium in women's and I ordered an extra large and it is still a bit tight for my 34 D bust, but I can make it work with a minimizing  bra and snug cami.",62503,3
62503,My only suggestion is if Asian companies are going to market to westerners that they should take into consideration accurate proportions in the bust area (granted I am larger than the norm but I think this applies to B and C cups as well).,62503,3
62504,"I love every items quality, but the flower girl basket is tiny....",62504,3
62505,liked it alot it but it was too small in length...,62505,3
62505,I got the XL... especially small in the chest  and a lil snug around the waist but it showed off my curves at least.... and it is a off color navy blue  (not black),62505,3
62506,No Golden Egg in the box we received  :-(,62506,3
62507,The wist doesn't fit too well it keeps coming off.,62507,3
62508,The backs are cheap plastic or silicone and seems like they come off easily.,62508,3
62508,"They did include extra backs for that reason, I guess.",62508,3
62508,Lots of earrings for price.,62508,3
62509,The chain itself is fine for an inexpensive chain (no one would ever mistake it for gold).,62509,3
62509,It didn't work for the pendant I had hoped to use it for....the clasp and connecting jump ring are too large for the opening on the pendant.,62509,3
62509,"Because of the design of the chain, I am not able to easily remove the end, slide on the pendant and then reattach.",62509,3
62509,I did work for another project I'm working on though.,62509,3
62510,they should have the sizes correctly posted ...this was ordered in understanding it was bigger size next up from the newborn when received it was newborn....fits son ok for now but won't last long like I hoped and they cant exchange would have to order new one then return this size...to much work to do when son needs something now,62510,3
62511,It's a bit short if you are thinking of wearing it without a tank or cami.,62511,3
62512,The tee runs small.,62512,3
62512,My Grand daughter wears a small in juniors.,62512,3
62512,The medium was almost to small.,62512,3
62512,Wish I had purchased a large.,62512,3
62512,The tee was very cute and well made.,62512,3
62512,I would purchase again.,62512,3
62513,"I really was excited about this ring, but I have yet to actually wear it after receiving it.",62513,3
62513,"It is a nice enough ring (and certainly a steal for the price), but I was disappointed when it arrived over a week after the delivery window had ended, and I wish the stone had more of the coloration as depicted in the product photos.",62513,3
62513,"Mine looks more purple than anything, and you really have to move the ring around to see any variations in color.",62513,3
62513,"Otherwise the stone was in good condition and so was the band, no scratches and it is shiny and seems relatively well made.",62513,3
62513,"If you are looking for a large stone solitaire, this would make a great piece of cocktail jewelry or something similar.",62513,3
62513,"I was hoping for a smaller stone, personally, with more color to it, so it hasn't really met my hopes for what it would look like.",62513,3
62513,"The ring is also slightly larger than I expected for my finger, so it rotates when I put it on.",62513,3
62514,I have owned wigwam socks for years and never had any issues.,62514,3
62514,"These socks feel great, don't retain odors, stay in place, dry quickly and are extremely durable.",62514,3
62514,However I am deducting one star because they run large.,62514,3
62514,Had to exchange them for mediums which fit perfectly.,62514,3
62514,These are the only medium size socks I own.,62514,3
62514,Deducting another star because both my grey and white socks are irreversibly stained by the brown softball infield dirt.,62514,3
62514,No other socks I own get permanently stained.,62514,3
62514,Wish I had bought medium sized black socks.,62514,3
62515,I'm 5'2 I'm an A cup and size 0.,62515,3
62515,The top piece fit nice the clasp seams like it may open during the night.,62515,3
62515,The bottom was way too big.,62515,3
62515,It falls off my waist.,62515,3
62515,You can fix it if you care enough.,62515,3
62515,It feels nice looks good was worth it once I got it tailored.,62515,3
62516,"The lettering and images were a little fuzzy, which was really the only issue I had with this shirt, but the husband loved it.",62516,3
62517,Very dainty and beautiful.,62517,3
62517,"However, I followed the directions I never showered with it or got it wet but still it's color faded and it doesn't look too nice.",62517,3
62517,I bought one for my mom for her birthday and I was sad that she's going through this as well,62517,3
62518,The split was not an optical illusion.,62518,3
62518,It goes all the way up my leg.,62518,3
62518,"I cannot wear it to church, because it shows too much of my leg.",62518,3
62520,Sizing must just run small.,62520,3
62521,Runs a little small and thin leather.,62521,3
62521,Although the letter is thin it does allow the hand to breathe without sweating profusely,62521,3
62522,"Much bigger than expected, and I have large eyes.",62522,3
62523,I loved this top!,62523,3
62523,Got so many compliments on it.,62523,3
62523,"Only thing was, when I washed it, all of the blue came off!",62523,3
62523,"Was kind of disappointed since I liked the color so much, but I'm glad that I'll still be able to wear it.",62523,3
62524,Really short - but nice fabric.,62524,3
62525,It's cute but bottoms are way too big.,62525,3
62525,My daughter wore this for a family outing the first time and I was totally embarrassed with how loose and totally inappropriate the bottoms were.,62525,3
62525,She loves the mermaid tail and has to wear over swim bottoms that don't match.,62525,3
62525,The bottoms won't fit for years.,62525,3
62526,cheap quality and a bit overpriced.,62526,3
62527,"While very comfortable, these are not built to last.",62527,3
62527,The fabric is the type that will hold on to odor and wear out quickly.,62527,3
62527,I would have given them four stars if not for the poor value.,62527,3
62528,advertised as an adult hat but its pretty small.,62528,3
62528,More like a child size,62528,3
62529,The S size was small for me and contacted the seller.,62529,3
62529,The seller is great and we found a way to improve my experience with this swimsuit.,62529,3
62529,I like the color and the print though.,62529,3
62530,Very cute but order up a size.,62530,3
62531,If you have heavy boobs I would not recommend.,62531,3
62531,It is obviously a cheap product but I do like it for those few shirts that I own that I CANNOT find any other bra to wear with it,62531,3
62532,Sleeves are a bit shorter than I was expecting.,62532,3
62533,Bought in a size up based on sizing and other reviews and it's pretty large.,62533,3
62533,"The top comes with padding but it isn't seamless, you can see the shape of the entire insert since the top is very thin.",62533,3
62533,"Ok for the price and I will be keeping, but these suits seem to have inconsistent sizing and quality.",62533,3
62534,Dress looks just like the picture and the quality is great.,62534,3
62534,It is very small in the chest area I wish I would have ordered it 2 sizes bigger.,62534,3
62534,It does take a while to get here from China but the Quality was good.,62534,3
62536,Too stretchy and hangs poorly.,62536,3
62537,They look better on line.,62537,3
62537,Maybe a little too big.,62537,3
62538,"The top fit a bit tighter around my belly area than I would have liked, and since the fabric is quite thin, it clings to really show off the parts I didn't want to show off.",62538,3
62538,The silver decorations have fallen off all over the place!,62538,3
62538,"They are in my suitcase, on the bathroom floor, every where the shirt has been it has left a little trail of silver sparkle.",62538,3
62539,Bought a small and had to tie it very tight.,62539,3
62539,"It's very wide and a little long than anticipated, but can be tied to ft better",62539,3
62540,Didn't last very long.,62540,3
62540,Already ripped on the strap where it connects.,62540,3
62541,"Cute dress, much longer than the picture though",62541,3
62542,Love the shirt - but it is VERY small.,62542,3
62542,I ordered the 8 for child who usually wears a 6 thinking we could get some wear from it but it barely fits.,62542,3
62542,Print is great and color is as shown.,62542,3
62542,Normally I find Disney brand clothing to run fairly true to size or even a bit large - this was definitely the exception.,62542,3
62543,Quality is not very good at all.,62543,3
62544,Still evident and easy to see even when not in personal space.,62544,3
62544,Pics are with flash and no flash.,62544,3
62544,Easy to trade out.,62544,3
62544,Wish I could get the disc on the inside aka flip it around.,62544,3
62545,I really liked it...,62545,3
62545,But one of the chains broke off after 1 week of wear and the heart fail off..,62545,3
62546,"cute top, but not so great quality.",62546,3
62546,"I bought both this one and the Patty Boutik brand since they looked exactly the same with of course a price difference, but returned this one and kept the Patty Boutik as it was a much better quality.",62546,3
62547,"This shirt is okay, it's very tight no matter the size and kinda short but it is very peretty if worn with high waisted shorts or a skirt!",62547,3
62548,Smaller than the other colors available.,62548,3
62548,I ordered two other colors and the red plaid was noticeably smaller.,62548,3
62549,"Beautiful flower design, exactly as pictured.",62549,3
62549,"Only complaint would be it defineitely runs small, I ordered a 2x so it would be oversized but it borderline fits snug, still love the product though.",62549,3
62550,The cut of these are odd and not very flattering.,62550,3
62550,"The material a little irritating, but better with a few washes.",62550,3
62550,Feels kind of cheap.,62550,3
62550,They have become undershirts rather than just regular shirts.,62550,3
62551,"It is fine, but it doesn't fit.",62551,3
62551,It's an extra large bur it would be a large fore a girl maybe.,62551,3
62552,"Not the worst shelf bra, ideal for lounging in the house or going to sleep, not for outside use.",62552,3
62554,"lots of loose thread to cut off, and for some reason the back pockets are half sewn closed.",62554,3
62554,"never had clothes made so poorly before, but after cutting the threads and opening the back pockets they're fine",62554,3
62555,"I bought them at the size that should have fit me best, but the crotch is very low.",62555,3
62555,Almost like MC Hammer pants.,62555,3
62555,If you want a tight fit go a size or two smaller.,62555,3
62556,Socks slide of my feet.,62556,3
62556,The material is nice and sturdy.,62556,3
62557,"It folds down very small, which is nice.",62557,3
62557,"Am not using it for luggage, but for carting documents that I pick up for work that are too heavy to carry.",62557,3
62557,I use a bankers cardboard box to put the records in.,62557,3
62557,There is no place to really hook the securing bungie and so I end up squashing my box.,62557,3
62557,The item came with absolutely no instructions.,62557,3
62557,It would have been nice for the manufacturer to provide at least a few pictures to show how the bungie can be used.,62557,3
62558,Cute pattern and nice material but fits very tight and too short for my legs.,62558,3
62558,130 lbs 5'6 bought a large.,62558,3
62559,"This fits pretty well and looks nice, but the quality is as you would expect from a cheaper knock-off.",62559,3
62559,"The fit is a bit weird, and the zipper broke after several weeks, it still zips up, but the zipper comes apart below the zipper.",62559,3
62559,It is nice and warm though.,62559,3
62559,"If you have the money, and are a Mass Effect fan, the $70 official bioware hoodie is well worth it, and I wish I had gotten it instead, but for occasional use, this one will work.",62559,3
62560,I love it but it the dress split is cut way too high.,62560,3
62562,I really like the shirt but it's a somewhat shapeless tent that runs a bit big the print is just okay and I feel like for the quality they could have come down on the price just a bit the fabric is obviously that cheaper type of cotton that doesn't feel all that nice against the skin even after washing with fabric softener,62562,3
62563,"if you have large busts, beware, order a larger size",62563,3
62564,"nice quality, prompt delivery, sizes run big",62564,3
62565,I like the belt but if you wear long it hurts your atomach,62565,3
62566,"I'm not blessed with a large chest, but it was too small in the chest and the rest of the tank was quite roomy.",62566,3
62566,"In other words, the cup portion rides up quite a bit/ only covers about half the breast.",62566,3
62566,"I do like it as pajamas, but would not order again.",62566,3
62567,I ordered XS but it appeared to be S .,62567,3
62567,Overall it's ok  and I maybe wear it someday.,62567,3
62568,The product is not true to size...,62568,3
62569,"Cute, but shorter than the picture and very small",62569,3
62570,"not what I expected....I'm smaller than alot of these reviews,,,,it seems kinda tiny through the chest, area,,,I wanted to wear Christmas day,, no ,I'm sure  will give it away,,,",62570,3
62571,It doesn't stay on and it just dangled but it is pretty.,62571,3
62571,I wish we can adjust the length not just the wrist,62571,3
62572,the material is thin though so be prepared.,62572,3
62572,"otherwise it's cool, a little different from the photo but still cute.",62572,3
62572,Also the bust is too tight for me lol,62572,3
62573,It's cute... if you have a slender body.,62573,3
62573,I have an above avg body weight with a slight belly.,62573,3
62573,This clingy dress accentuates it.,62573,3
62574,I haven't really smelt any better... but the stinky smell has not gotten worse.,62574,3
62574,I would say they just help keep the smell from getting worse rather than eliminating it.,62574,3
62575,"Not well made at all--in fact, an el cheapo.",62575,3
62576,Does look like the picture but not long at all to short,62576,3
62577,But at lease 3 sizes small.,62577,3
62578,This wallet is exactly the same as the leopardd one which is half the price.,62578,3
62579,A bit in the thin side.,62579,3
62579,Not what I expected but didn't pay much for it... maybe a good store purse.,62579,3
62580,"Material is good and the top fits, but it makes it look like my boobs are trying to escape out the top even though everything else fits.",62580,3
62580,The bottoms look NOTHING like the picture fit wise.,62580,3
62580,the back has the same amount of material as the front meaning the back covers nothing in terms of the butt area.,62580,3
62580,"From the front it looks fine, but I was too afraid to walk in it because my butt would have just fallen out",62580,3
62581,Very cute and stylish but they do run small,62581,3
62582,Glowing ball is a lot smaller than it looks in the picture but it's still cute.,62582,3
62583,"An ok item, nothing special",62583,3
62584,Wasn't thrilled with this dress.,62584,3
62584,The material is not as nice as it looks in the picture.,62584,3
62585,The Vendors are really nice and the sweater was cute.,62585,3
62586,"This is a very nice, well made and stylish skirt, however it's extremely small.",62586,3
62586,"When laying flat it measures 10 "" at the waist and 18 "" across the base of the skirt with a 15"" height.",62586,3
62586,"The elastic will indeed stretch to slightly more than 31"", but there is so little of the cloth material that it loses its A line shape, hanging almost vertically from the waist.",62586,3
62586,"If the manufacturer would make this in a larger size, I would definitely buy it again.",62586,3
62587,looks very nice in picture but very flimsy,62587,3
62588,"These are awesome sock patterns, I admit.",62588,3
62588,"I do have to say, though, that they are extremely tight on my 9-10 foot size, so saying 7 up to 11 is rather liberal.",62588,3
62588,I would say 7-8 in foot size to be comfortable.,62588,3
62588,"If they were larger, I would give a five star rating.",62588,3
62589,"The slippers are way to large for this size of house coat, but the house coat is ok.",62589,3
62590,Cute but they were crooked.,62590,3
62590,Since it's basically one piece we melted it with a lighter and bent the sides to match,62590,3
62591,Guess I miss judge it online but didn't fit as I had hope,62591,3
62592,Dress was beautiful but I returned it because the color of the lace sleeves was different from the color of the dress,62592,3
62593,"They're cute, but paint them over with clear nail polish or you'll start losing stones immediately.",62593,3
62593,"For the price though, they're great.",62593,3
62594,"Great straw hat, but as all straw hats go, durability is complete s***.",62594,3
62594,"Maybe mine was more brittle than most, but a carton of eggs lasted longer.",62594,3
62595,"Sooo, the strings are weird....There is a huge amount of extra string, that once tightened to my body, just hangs.",62595,3
62595,It makes no sense.,62595,3
62595,"Aside from that though, the suit fits me pretty well, so I'm thinking about just cutting the strings and sewing it to fit my body.",62595,3
62595,"However, I can definitely see how bigger breasted women would have trouble fitting into this suit.",62595,3
62595,"I'm a 32B and it fits me, but any larger I think would be too tight up top.",62595,3
62597,outside looks just like the picture!,62597,3
62597,but inside looks to cheap!,62597,3
62599,"Nice belt, but runs very small",62599,3
62600,Bra fits a bit snug but wearable.,62600,3
62600,"Underwear, however are very small.",62600,3
62601,Material is average for the price.,62601,3
62601,"Wrinkles easy, but a steamer or iron fixes that issue.",62601,3
62601,The main issue with this dress is the size.,62601,3
62601,"It is tight, small, and short.",62601,3
62601,"I'm about 5'9"" and the waist was about a half inch above my natural waist.",62601,3
62601,"The bottom of the dress fell to just above my knees, it naturally was even higher with a crinoline.",62601,3
62601,I wear a 6/8 normally and purchased the large based on other reviews.,62601,3
62601,"Any smaller would have been unwearable, but the large fit well enough.",62601,3
62601,The hidden zipper is on the side under the arm.,62601,3
62601,"I had to modify the dress to wear it, but it made for a nice costume.",62601,3
62602,Was told it had the same lining in sleeves and it Does Not.,62602,3
62603,It is a little flimsy - obviously okay in some circumstances but I wouldn't go to church in it.,62603,3
62604,"I sent in the exact measurements and dress was way too small, had to take it to seamstress to let it out 4 inches!",62604,3
62604,She also attached the straps better and put lace across the top of the back because the tulle was way to flimsy.,62604,3
62604,"They do communicate well and the dress is beautiful, just buy well in advance so if you have to have it altered.",62604,3
62605,I get a lot of compliments on the necklace,62605,3
62607,Love the snaps on both sides.,62607,3
62607,They seem to run large.,62607,3
62607,I have a fat 28lber and he was swimming in the large.,62607,3
62608,"I think they were over priced, but they we're a gift to someone  and she was happy with them",62608,3
62609,arrived 2 weeks early!,62609,3
62609,but... the back was bent on the cat.,62609,3
62609,i was able to bend it back.,62609,3
62610,These jeans are not high waisted at all!,62610,3
62610,I'm curvy with a 32in waist and 41in hip but there is no way these would be high waisted on anyone but a stick.,62610,3
62610,"Also, there was no buttonhole.",62610,3
62611,Okay to sleep in but not a true 3xlt,62611,3
62612,"nothing fancy, but what can you expect for such price?",62612,3
62614,Simple and cheap but keep flawless time..for children,62614,3
62616,this pic does not show this is a button up with a color.,62616,3
62616,If it looked like the pic it would have been perfect.,62616,3
62617,"Dress was cute, but very short!",62617,3
62618,I really liked this bikini and I really wanted it to fit.,62618,3
62618,"I bought an XL hoping at least the top would fit (not too concerned with the bottoms, as I wasn't planning on wearing them).",62618,3
62618,The cups were still way too small.,62618,3
62618,"The straps didn't adjust tight enough for my liking, either.",62618,3
62618,"Had to send it back :(

Overall, a very nice bikini.",62618,3
62618,I just wish I would have been able to fit it!,62618,3
62619,Cute and goes with everything.,62619,3
62619,The only thing I didn't like was that the Sherpa fur didn't line the whole beanie just right there in the front.,62619,3
62620,"was really hard to get them on, once on I couldn't breath 3x is the size I ware and they didn't fit right.",62620,3
62620,they did make my butt look bigger but not my much,62620,3
62621,The swimsuit itself is gorgeous.,62621,3
62621,If you have large breast the top will not fit.,62621,3
62621,"Anything larger than a C cup, look elsewhere.",62621,3
62622,has started fading  after 30 days,62622,3
62623,Wasn't quite what I expected and a little small.,62623,3
62624,"Very supportive, but hard to zip up",62624,3
62625,Cute but bit small..,62625,3
62626,It came very very small.,62626,3
62626,"I do like the design, but I recommend getting a larger size if you are buying this.",62626,3
62626,Plus this came a week early.,62626,3
62627,Fits fine everywhere else.,62627,3
62627,The top is really low and it's too short; it went down to my ankles.,62627,3
62628,"It didn't fit me, but I guess its okay because I wanted to lose weight anyways.",62628,3
62628,I do think that its going to fit once I lose some pounds I'll send pictures ones I try it again :3 liked the fabric its thin and perfect for summer.,62628,3
62628,The only thing I didn't like was that in the picture it has some kind of elastic so I thought it really was one size but no it isnt.,62628,3
62628,If your size is bigger than 14 don't buy it I wouldnt reccomend at least that you wabt to get motivated to loose some weight xp.,62628,3
62629,"This is a really pretty suit, however, it fits on the small size and we ordered bigger",62629,3
62630,Size large is huge.,62630,3
62630,"Size medium is somewhat large for a woman, but I was afraid size small would be too tight and more apt to wear out quicker.",62630,3
62632,This is a very cute bathing suit top.,62632,3
62632,The problem with it is there is so much material and it's heavy so you're weighed down by it.,62632,3
62632,Also the straps are about 4 inches too long and they're not adjustable.,62632,3
62632,If it wasn't for the halter style straps around the neck it would fall right off.,62632,3
62632,I would need at least 1-2 sizes smaller.,62632,3
62633,It is an odd fit.,62633,3
62633,Definitely order 1 size smaller to fit better.,62633,3
62634,"Pretty design, but it was too small for me.",62634,3
62634,The neckline is a little funny and didn't lay quite right.,62634,3
62634,"If I could have ordered a size up it would have been nice, but the sizes are very limited from this company.",62634,3
62635,"The fabric is a bit thin, but for the price they are ok.",62635,3
62636,Too small and see through fabric.,62636,3
62637,"Nice suit, cut is great but it's really tight around the shoulders...hurts to wear too long.",62637,3
62638,"The cover is a tad too soft, I wish they provided some kind of lining.",62638,3
62638,Holder quality is reasonable and I expect this one to last a few years.,62638,3
62640,"Dress rides up a bit, way different than picture and had to keep holding my dress down",62640,3
62641,"Light weight, but does the job!",62641,3
62641,Fits over light coat for my size 6 daughter.,62641,3
62642,"The corset its self is good, but it's not long like the description says, have to keep pulling it down.",62642,3
62643,"I like the shirt but compared to others that I purchased from you, it's extraordinarily small for an extra large",62643,3
62644,I ordered the item based on price and reviews.,62644,3
62644,"Unfortunately underwhelming, it's a little bit on the ""flimsy"" side.",62644,3
62644,The buckles look like it's just painted on and gives it the appearance of chipping off over time.,62644,3
62644,Just not what I expected based on reviews and item description.,62644,3
62644,The seller does chip fast and accepts returns so thumbs up on customer service,62644,3
62645,"cheap chain , but what I expected for price",62645,3
62646,Doesn't match that well and the top cups are kinda weird but it's cute,62646,3
62647,Hat is too small to slouch its basically a beanie.,62647,3
62647,A well made beanie but not a slouchy hat.,62647,3
62648,It ran to small,62648,3
62649,"Nice material, good for the price, just is 1 mm narrower than it shoul be, so you get a little gap and movement where it attaches to the watch.",62649,3
62650,"Overall, ok for pajamas.",62650,3
62650,Would have been better if all the graphics on the shirt glowed.,62650,3
62651,The dress is too short for anyone over 5'7.,62651,3
62651,I am 5'9 and cannot wear this dress in public.,62651,3
62651,"The top fit me really well, but I need another 2 inches just to cover my bum.",62651,3
62652,Its really pretty but like the other reviews have said the quality is weak.,62652,3
62652,Mine started popping holes everywhere.,62652,3
62652,I'm sad about this because it would otherwise have perfect stars,62652,3
62653,It's a fine product if you're looking for something really small.,62653,3
62653,"I was hoping for something bigger, so it wasn't for me.",62653,3
62653,But if you just need a small case to hold your items...then it's great.,62653,3
62654,grandson love them even if the were tight,62654,3
62655,I've worn pleaser shoes before and I'm always pleased ;) the only complaint I have with these specific shoes is that the stiletto is very thin...kind of hard to walk in...even for a veteran,62655,3
62657,bottoms fit perfect but since I am postpartum and breastfeeding I am extremely big in the chest.,62657,3
62658,"purchased for child, so I can't speak to the comfort or arch support really.",62658,3
62659,I love this suit and it fits everywhere but my small girls.,62659,3
62659,There is a gap in the breast area that I can not get to fill even after playing with tightening/loosening the straps.,62659,3
62659,"I am 5,4 and 150lbs with Bs and ordered a large, per other reviews.",62659,3
62659,Colors and material are great.,62659,3
62660,It's  beautiful but the panties aren't what I expected.,62660,3
62660,They're a bit tight.,62660,3
62660,"They aren't the shorts style they look like, more like a thick thong.",62660,3
62660,Slightly disappointed but it's still a very pretty set and wearable.,62660,3
62660,The bra gives really nice lift and support.,62660,3
62661,33.00 coat is what it is that is the only reason it got 3 stars,62661,3
62662,The color in the picture is super ugly.,62662,3
62662,There's a button sintch option in the back that is really cool.,62662,3
62662,But assume assian sizes in the bust and arm pits.,62662,3
62662,I will have to order one in a size larger and hope that the waist won't need to be tailored.,62662,3
62663,When I received the necklace the charm was already broke off.,62663,3
62663,Had to fix it,62663,3
62664,"This top fits okay, although its a little snug around my bottom.",62664,3
62664,I'm not sure if that's the way it's supposed to fit or not but it's not a problem.,62664,3
62664,It will work for me because I just wanted a longer top to wear with a pair of leggings and this does the trick.,62664,3
62665,For the black I think i ordered the wrong size but it's cute.,62665,3
62665,The orange still hasn't arrived and it was suppose to be here today.,62665,3
62665,Now I'm one casual outfit down for my trip and I'm annoyed.,62665,3
62667,GREAT FOR MY NEED,62667,3
62669,I ordered yellow + silver and received Green + silver.,62669,3
62669,size and over all quality is good.,62669,3
62670,The roses broke off after 3 days of wearing them and thays with very gentle and light use.,62670,3
62670,However they are cheap and amazing looking so personally i would buy again and again just to have.,62670,3
62671,For the price it's pretty good.,62671,3
62671,"Functionally, this little purse is fine.",62671,3
62671,"Dollars, credit cards or business cards fit nicely in the outside pocket.",62671,3
62671,One has a little uneven tuck in the leather on the left side and is a bit lop-sided.,62671,3
62671,The other one has a poor fit of the leather holding the top metal band so the metal sticks out more.,62671,3
62671,(see pics)  Time will tell how they hold up.,62671,3
62671,Do love the red color.,62671,3
62672,I love the shirt itself.,62672,3
62672,Its just very small and short,62672,3
62673,I liked the shirt.,62673,3
62673,"It fit well except in the sleeves where the design patch is, making it hard to bend my arm.",62673,3
62674,Too small but beautiful,62674,3
62675,Material not as expected but soable.,62675,3
62676,"Nice fit, could have been nicer without the mustache looking patch on the mouth piece, took a lot a work to remove it.",62676,3
62679,I had to order a M\L.,62679,3
62679,I would've gotten a S\M if it were available.,62679,3
62679,However it does fit (just not quite as tight as I expected) Also I think you need a little junk in your trunk (if you know what I mean) for this to really work well.,62679,3
62679,"I got it to go under a loose fitting dress so I think its going to work for me, but couldn't put it under something form fitting!",62679,3
62680,Looks a little cheap.,62680,3
62680,I will wear it until it turns dull.,62680,3
62682,"Ran much smaller than my other Tribal Clothing, very disappointed",62682,3
62683,Pretty good buy for the price..is somewhat poorly made but again for the price It's what I expected .,62683,3
62683,Came with very deep set wrinkles in though so I will most likely be getting it professionally steamed,62683,3
62684,I'm pretty sure these are plastic.,62684,3
62684,When I cleaned the 'jade' ones some of the green washes off.,62684,3
62684,I'm sure a stones color doesn't wash off like that.,62684,3
62684,Gave them three stars because they still look alright.,62684,3
62685,I was not too sure about the size since it said they run small.,62685,3
62685,So I went from a 34 to 36 and they are a little to big .,62685,3
62685,I can use them but just have to go up a notch on my belt.,62685,3
62686,I bought a large..  which I am in some things a medium and some large.,62686,3
62686,Skirt to small around the waist.,62686,3
62687,Beautiful shirt but way too small.,62687,3
62687,This is the second item I've ordered from Orvis and have been very disappointed.,62687,3
62687,Should have learned my lesson the first time.,62687,3
62687,This was on sale so I am just donating it to charity instead of returning it.,62687,3
62688,"This is very pretty but when I got it, it stunk of whatever chemical was used on the leather.",62688,3
62688,"I had to carefully wash it off with soap and water many times, alternating with H2O2 until the cheap stink was gone.",62688,3
62688,I still use it to this day and still looks fabulous.,62688,3
62689,"Very cute and received a ton of compliments but I ended up having to wear it as a swimsuit coverup since the mini skirt part underneath in the front is very short and I'm only 5'2"".",62689,3
62690,The pros: I was very pleased when I first opened the package.,62690,3
62690,The material feels very nice; it is sleek and soft.,62690,3
62690,The pattern is vibrant and eye appealing.,62690,3
62690,The tie on the front of the top is a nice feature and is an added plus for both style and fit so you could adjust it to the way it 'holds' you.,62690,3
62690,The over shoulder straps are also adjustable.,62690,3
62690,The cons: The top is WAY to big.,62690,3
62690,"I usually wear a 38C bra size (but I always get a 38 D swimsuit top - otherwise I do not get the coverage), but this was h.u.g.e.",62690,3
62690,-two of me could fit into this top.,62690,3
62690,"The underwire comes up a little bit to high in the middle, and i could tell that  it would be a problem area, had it fit.",62690,3
62690,"The bottoms fit as far as getting them on, but are too snug and would be in the uncomfortable zone.",62690,3
62690,"The bottoms also show all of my fluffy belly muffin areas, both above and below but especially on the sides (I am normally a 12/14).",62690,3
62690,"It is too bad because I really do like the suit, but i think the sizing is way off.",62690,3
62690,"There is just no way I could get away with wearing either the top or the bottom even as separates, or I would have kept it because well, it is that pretty.",62690,3
62690,If you could order this in the top and bottom separately I believe it would help with the sizing issue.,62690,3
62690,"If you are extra extra large on the top, have no fluff, and small on the bottom then this might fit, but  unfortunately I am not so I had to return the suit.",62690,3
62690,I did NOT receive this item at a discount for my feedback - and I did NOT receive this item for free for my feedback.,62690,3
62690,I paid full price and am still giving my 100% honest and true opinion.,62690,3
62691,It's small on top but I am keeping it because it's cute and will be fine as a cover up over bathing suits.,62691,3
62692,"The case is great, and they are quite durable, however the nose bridge is extremely uncomfortable.",62692,3
62692,I can't wear them more the 10 minutes without my nose starting to ache.,62692,3
62693,It appears to be a peach color in the web picture.,62693,3
62693,"However, it's closer to a burnt orange.",62693,3
62693,"Too bad, am returning.",62693,3
62694,For the price the dress is pretty nice.,62694,3
62694,"I used it for my Halloween costume so it was perfect for that, but I wouldn't have used this for any kind of formal event.",62694,3
62694,"Mine was a lace up back, had I known that I would have sized down.",62694,3
62694,I'm guessing s m l sizes are lace up and numbered sizes are zipper.,62694,3
62694,I think the description really should be updated because you have no idea what you'll get.,62694,3
62694,"Also it does bunch up in the back really bad, luckily I was able to modify it so it's not so bad.",62694,3
62694,Again I wouldn't recommend for anything other than costume,62694,3
62695,"Size is too small, returned",62695,3
62696,"cute dress, but I looked horrible in it.",62696,3
62697,"i bought this shirt because I thought, from the pictures it was a burnout, but it's just their weird stringy burlap-like material.",62697,3
62697,It is not soft at all.,62697,3
62697,it's not a total loss.,62697,3
62697,"I gave it 3 stars because it does look exactly like the picture and it's not horrible, it's just not the soft workout shirt I was looking for.",62697,3
62698,some card slots are tight... could get em in... but out OMG,62698,3
62699,Had to take off about 4 inches.,62699,3
62700,I'd like the sticky rim (where it is supposed to hold onto your pants) to be wider because I am always hiking it back down and pulling my pants back up.,62700,3
62701,Had to send back a piece was broken off but will order a new one soon,62701,3
62702,Size was too big and I didn't really like how it looked on me.,62702,3
62702,I'm not super full-figured.,62702,3
62702,I think this would look a lot better on someone who is fuller chested.,62702,3
62703,Very thin and see through.,62703,3
62704,Its a basic cotton dress.,62704,3
62704,It is good for the price.,62704,3
62704,The cut is nice and the neck line is flattering.,62704,3
62704,"The dress did have a spot on it (black streaks approx 2 long) when I received it; however, it did not appear used.",62704,3
62704,"I did not send it back, as I am lazy.",62704,3
62704,I am just hoping it comes out with a wash.,62704,3
62704,If it does not come out - I will be sure to update this review.,62704,3
62704,"As for the size, it fits pretty much as expected, but it is on the tighter side, just FYI.",62704,3
62704,I wear a 4/small and ordered a small.,62704,3
62705,It is soft and warm but way too big for a size large.,62705,3
62705,I wish I had ordered a medium or small.,62705,3
62706,It is very comfortable.,62706,3
62706,It ran smaller than I hoped,62706,3
62707,"These do fit as expected, but they're not consistent.",62707,3
62707,"The length is just shy of my ankle, so they feel a bit short.",62707,3
62707,"One pair, the waistband fits great.",62707,3
62707,"The other, it's like the waistband was not seen with elastic at all and is very difficult to get on.",62707,3
62707,"I like these, but I wish they fit the same.",62707,3
62708,I can't give a complete review because the size I chose was way too large.,62708,3
62708,I like the product but I have to send this one back for a size down to know for sure!,62708,3
62708,Unfortunately there wasn't a size chart but I have posted a picture for others to see.,62708,3
62708,"Please note, my picture of the measurements are cropped but they are for chest, waist and height.",62708,3
62710,Good looking shirt but extremely slow size compare to other slim fits.,62710,3
62710,I suggest going a size above your normal size,62710,3
62711,they are so beautiful!,62711,3
62711,"they fit my legs perfect, but the waist is too large on these and they fall down when I bend over.",62711,3
62712,Thigh highs didn't stay up.,62712,3
62712,Had to write them as knee highs.,62712,3
62712,Still made the costume look great.,62712,3
62714,My absolute favorite piece of body jewelry.,62714,3
62714,"The downsides, unfortunately, are that
1) after a while the bright silver wears off and reveals a dull brownish copper beneath, and
2) the bar has to be super long in order to twist on the loose wing without hurting yourself.",62714,3
62714,If only it were fastened with an internal magnet instead of threading :(,62714,3
62715,Leaves you with no butt,62715,3
62716,"Really cute, not the best quality, but okay.",62716,3
62716,Plus the small size is true to size.,62716,3
62716,"If you're an xs size, the dress will still be too big.",62716,3
62717,It fits a little lose.,62717,3
62717,"I've never been able to wear it on my finger, but it looks cool on my necklace.",62717,3
62718,"Cute hat, nice quality but it was way too small and I don't think my head is that big.",62718,3
62719,Pretty comfortable to wear but they're cheap quality.,62719,3
62720,"Great looking bag--but very large across the bottom--in the picture it looked like it would be a soft bag, but it turned out to be very stiff on the bottom so too bulky for me--i am sorry because i love the look",62720,3
62721,"These just arrived in the mail today, so I haven't been able to evaluate how well they will hold up, but now I'm wondering...",62721,3
62721,They arrived packaged very nicely in a pretty green box and were securely wrapped.,62721,3
62721,I received a tiny bag of earring backs (lots of rubber ones and one set of metal ones).,62721,3
62721,The earrings were tiny and delicate as I expected.,62721,3
62721,They are slightly smaller than an identical design I have purchased from Ann Taylor earlier this year.,62721,3
62721,"So as far as looks go, they are great.",62721,3
62721,I went to put the metal earring back on the earring and the post bent!,62721,3
62721,It is very soft metal and seems that the gauge of the post is too fat to go in the metal back.,62721,3
62721,I tried the rubber backs with the same result.,62721,3
62721,Thankfully I was able to bend the post back in place.,62721,3
62721,I tried other rubber backs that I already owned and was finally successful with a completely different earring back (the kind with a larger plastic disk and metal back).,62721,3
62721,"Other than the SOFT metal that the post is made of and the fact that the earring backs provided don't fit, I really like these earrings.",62721,3
62721,"I love my Ann Taylor pair in gold, so was happy to find this pair in silver.",62721,3
62721,"If you're not overly concerned with quality and are willing to have earrings that are fragile, these are lovely.",62721,3
62722,Just ran too small.,62722,3
62723,it is  not NANO-tehnology,62723,3
62724,A lot shorter than it looks online.,62724,3
62724,I got size large and I wear 34DDD...with a strapless bandeau the shirt is still really short and I need to pull it down constantly.,62724,3
62725,Half the socks are too small.,62725,3
62725,"4 out of the 8 pairs of socks fit perfectly, the other half are made for children cause they don't fit me at all, I have a regular size 9.5 foot.",62725,3
62725,"The colors and graphics aren't too bad though, they look pretty cool.",62725,3
62726,Cute and well made.,62726,3
62727,Little loose but for day to day and rough use..,62727,3
62728,I ordered a 2T and it fits like a 4T on my daughter.,62728,3
62729,This blouse is what one would expect for the price.,62729,3
62729,"The print is a bit fuzzy (ie, low quality) and the fabric is fair quality.",62729,3
62729,But it is very inexpensive and a cheap way to add the season's trendy florals to my wardrobe without a big investment.,62729,3
62729,"It did arrive quite wrinkled and had to be ironed, and one button fell off quickly.",62729,3
62729,"So if you are looking for high quality, this is not it, but if you want a comfortable springy blouse for low cost, it fits the bill.",62729,3
62730,Ok but run very small.,62730,3
62731,It's pretty but a little bigger than thought.,62731,3
62732,"I wanted something comfortable - while it is not overly difficult, it does run small and even with the enclosed extender, it's not to size.",62732,3
62732,"There is room for pads, tho' I don't need them, for a nursing mom, that's kind of important.",62732,3
62732,"Pretty, but it's not great.",62732,3
62733,Was a perfect costume if I was a size DDD in the chest; everywhere else fit except for the belt was too small.,62733,3
62734,They really do not stay on as a cuff and I had to wear them as basic earring so they lost a little bit of the appeal.,62734,3
62735,I really wanted to love this sweater but there are a few things that I have to list to be completely honest.,62735,3
62735,The sweater is not at all over-sized or baggy.,62735,3
62735,Unless you are an extremely tiny person this won't be baggy at all!,62735,3
62735,"The sewing was poor on the sweater seems and there were strings hanging all over the inside of my sweater but since they were on the inside, I decided it didn't bother me.",62735,3
62735,"The sleeves are short on me and even though I went a size up, it still fit me as my regular size.",62735,3
62735,I usually wear a women's small to medium and ordered a large.,62735,3
62735,The color I ordered was a dark burgundy and I really like the color and received compliments on it.,62735,3
62735,"I kept the sweater and gave it 3 stars because for the price, I wasn't too upset.",62735,3
62735,Just what happens when you buy clothes on line--sight unseen.,62735,3
62735,I would definitely suggest you size up.,62735,3
62735,"For reference, I am 5'4"" and 130lbs",62735,3
62736,Cute but too tight,62736,3
62737,But overall absolutely fabulous!,62737,3
62738,"This was not anecessarily ""A"" FramR flowing dress.",62738,3
62738,It was a straight line dress.. but it was very beautiful.,62738,3
62738,Too bad they couldn't get the measurements correct.,62738,3
62740,I like wearing slip-on shoes.,62740,3
62740,These particular pair run a little small.,62740,3
62741,Cute if u are smaller.,62741,3
62741,But NOT what I expected.,62741,3
62741,They feel like spandex material.,62741,3
62741,Worried they will be see through.,62741,3
62742,"Its not 100% as pictured on the model, but close.",62742,3
62742,The arms are alot shorter and a different color than pictured.,62742,3
62743,Shoot hangs differently than the picture,62743,3
62744,It was fine just didt like how the angel charm was made in the back.,62744,3
62745,The dress is really pretty  and I was so excited to get my wedding dress.,62745,3
62745,But is was a major let down when it was much smaller than the measurements online.,62745,3
62746,Washing to see if it helps but possibly returning them,62746,3
62747,"Not US sizing, but very cute!",62747,3
62748,was not green as it appear,62748,3
62749,"Only wore them briefly however, the fit was good.",62749,3
62749,I was disappointed in the dullness of the color.,62749,3
62749,I was hoping for a brighter red.,62749,3
62749,Looks different from picture.,62749,3
62750,"Just as expected from reading most other reviews, but it will mainly be used for car travel and only once or twice a year for airline travel so I was willing to take a chance on it.",62750,3
62751,"The bottoms for perfectly, if not too perfect.",62751,3
62751,"The top, however, was big and loose.",62751,3
62751,I'm 34 C 5'2 about 110 pounds.,62751,3
62751,Bottoms fit top was big.,62751,3
62751,The top also had weird padding that I think I'll cut out,62751,3
62752,It doesn't feel like more than a sticker,62752,3
62753,Fit one size smaller.,62753,3
62755,Way shorter than expected and the material is kinda thin,62755,3
62756,Just get better chains,62756,3
62757,Heavy material that doesn't breathe at all!,62757,3
62758,sleeves were too tight but the dress fit just fine.,62758,3
62759,The heart point is sharp.,62759,3
62759,I do not wear it because it scratches me.,62759,3
62760,the beading snagged my dress.,62760,3
62761,It hangs backwards and has the red cross logo.,62761,3
62761,I specifically chose it because it is the only one that did not show the logo in the picture.,62761,3
62762,Cute but runs way small.,62762,3
62763,The sleeves are tight and the picture is misleading.,62763,3
62763,The design on the sleeves is only stamped on.,62763,3
62763,I should have known for the price it wouldn't be embroidered.,62763,3
62763,It didn't shrink and it is nice and warm.,62763,3
62763,If you want it roomier and longer go up a size (or 2).,62763,3
62763,"All in all, I wear it a lot, but just to knock around in.",62763,3
62763,It's not the unique piece I was hoping for.,62763,3
62764,"The dress was well made, however the breast area was a little on the the larger side the rest of the dress fits well.",62764,3
62764,"However, I am disappointed because I order two and got 1 along with a completely different style and colour (seller fault).",62764,3
62765,Looks a little cheap...,62765,3
62766,However the material is very cheap.,62766,3
62767,Nice shirt for the price.,62767,3
62767,Quality of fabric is not what I would purchase in person.,62767,3
62767,"Bow on back is just tacked on, looks like it will fall off easily.",62767,3
62769,I bought the paradox jacket in a size medium for my husband for an upcoming trip to Europe this spring.,62769,3
62769,"He is generally a true medium when it comes to shirts and sweaters, but this jacket is much bigger than his other coats.",62769,3
62769,I would suggest purchasing a size down even if you plan wearing an extra layer underneath.,62769,3
62769,"I would've returned it for a small, but there are no smalls available.",62769,3
62769,"Since he hasn't worn it yet, I cannot comment on its use in the rain.",62769,3
62770,CONS-These gloves were not proportionate.,62770,3
62770,"They were difficult to get on, bulky and to long in the fingers.",62770,3
62770,The lining in the one was a bit off from the glove itself.,62770,3
62770,Making it especially hard to get the thumb in.,62770,3
62770,I sent them back.,62770,3
62770,PROS-Fast and easy refund.,62770,3
62770,Seem well made otherwise.,62770,3
62770,I would consider trying this brand again but I will skip child size.,62770,3
62772,Wound up being too big.,62772,3
62772,But a good product otherwise.,62772,3
62773,Printing should have been in white not black.,62773,3
62773,Hard to read by others.,62773,3
62774,I like the style but it was a bit tight in the chest for me.,62774,3
62776,"Really liked the picture on website,  the detail on the nose ring itself was really too small to see.",62776,3
62776,"The post was longer than the nose ring I was wearing,  I wasn't used to it,  so I bent the post too many times and broke it.",62776,3
62776,"It doesn't sit flush to the nose,  it's raised.",62776,3
62776,Not bad just different,62776,3
62777,Great material but too small.. Will save for next size down,62777,3
62778,The material starts to get linty and made little balls on the material on first use.,62778,3
62779,its cute as expected but broke within 5 minutes.,62779,3
62780,I was just looking for a second suit to take to the beach.,62780,3
62780,I didn't want to spend a lot of money.,62780,3
62780,The suit is cute and very modest.,62780,3
62780,It is somewhat cheaply made but then the price is cheap too.,62780,3
62780,The stitching on one side is puckered a little.,62780,3
62780,If I was going to be wearing it a lot I would return it but just for an extra suit it is ok.,62780,3
62780,The fit is flattering.,62780,3
62780,I ordered a size up but I think the smaller size would have worked fine.,62780,3
62780,I haven't worn it in the water yet so I don't know if it is going to sag from the weight or not.,62780,3
62780,There is a lot of padding in the bust so if you don't like that you won't like this suit.,62780,3
62780,I am not large in the chest but I think for more well endowed women this suit might be uncomfortable.,62780,3
62781,"I loved the idea of these, but the zippers barely worked.",62781,3
62781,The price was low though so I wasn't expecting much different.,62781,3
62782,It was bigger than expected,62782,3
62783,"Nice for the price, but they fall down.",62783,3
62783,I was constantly pulling them up all day.,62783,3
62783,"Purchased for Halloween, and they worked well, but
I would not want to wear them for every day.",62783,3
62784,"I returned this item, due to the gauge being too large for my nose ring area.",62784,3
62784,"The company did a good job of giving a description as well as the size of gauge, I just didn't realize how small I actually needed, I have never measured.",62784,3
62784,"The product looked like it was made well, and the gems looked secure, which has always been a concern of mine.",62784,3
62784,I would suggest the item to those who know the size gauge they need.,62784,3
62785,"it's alright, it's an okay skirt but it isn't the skirt from the picture.",62785,3
62785,the straps were attachable and such but the stitching for the buttonholes is shotty and i have to fix it so I can get it to even fit on the buttons.,62785,3
62785,It doesn't have the elastic band around it and the fabric is very thin.,62785,3
62785,Also the skirt is put on and off with a zipper that I at least didn't see in the pictures.,62785,3
62785,it's still a nice skirt but just..not the skirt in the picture.,62785,3
62787,I LOVE THE LOOK but it ran waaaay too small so I give it to a friend.,62787,3
62787,Anyone buying this the sizes do run a small.,62787,3
62787,Buy a size up :),62787,3
62788,"I don't think it looks the same in person as it does in the picture and the colors on the top aren't as vibrant, with that being said it is still a cute dress.",62788,3
62788,"Although, it is very long and I will have to wear VERY high heels or get it altered.",62788,3
62788,The size is slightly large on the top too and I am pretty large busted so it's pretty rare for a top to be too big,62788,3
62790,3 stars because it isn't a maximum dress.,62790,3
62790,I got it for that specific reason.,62790,3
62790,I got a xlarge because I'm pregnant...normally a medium.,62790,3
62790,It's snug around the hips and bust area.,62790,3
62790,I'm 5'7 and it reaches my knees.,62790,3
62790,Too bad..the material print is pretty but very thin.,62790,3
62790,I use it around the house only.,62790,3
62790,I think it's also a bit sheer so I would need to wear rights underneath.,62790,3
62791,Cheap hat that doesnt look cheap!,62791,3
62791,"It took a while for shipping to come in but it looks true to the picture, just slightly small.",62791,3
62791,I would be careful if washing in a washer because of the material and if it shrinks anymore it will be hard for you to wear!,62791,3
62792,Looked same as picture but a little feminine for a Man,62792,3
62793,These are ok water shoes.,62793,3
62793,"I wear any where between a 10 and a 12 depending on the brand of woman's shoe, and am comfortable in a 9.5 in mens and I do not know that I would consider these to fit well, but they work.",62793,3
62793,I ordered and XL per the sizing offered on the page and I feel that my toes are alittle cramped.,62793,3
62793,"But, they stay on well even though my foot hangs over the edge of the sole.",62793,3
62793,"When it comes down to it, I'd rather wear them than not and the sides are stretch enough to accommodate but I wouldn't do any long walk on the beach with them.",62793,3
62794,Runs very small and short waisted for full figured women.,62794,3
62794,"Order at least one size up, maybe two.",62794,3
62794,Lower rating based on sizing not quality.,62794,3
62795,"a lot of the same but different....example (several flowers but different rose, daisy, sunflower, ect) I ended up doing 2 bracelets
 for 2 different  people...so it worked out OK.",62795,3
62796,Not a good fit if you have curves,62796,3
62797,Came with right amount.,62797,3
62797,"But, all the designs were bland and boring.",62797,3
62797,Definitely not the same in the pictures.,62797,3
62797,Missing a few balls and some stripped and won't screw on or all the way.,62797,3
62798,"The suit is cute, and if you order according to the size chart there isn't a problem, but it is for short torsos.",62798,3
62799,"Cute boots, seem made well but they are HUGE",62799,3
62800,It is packed up ready to return,62800,3
62801,"They were very blingy and pretty, not the best quality though.",62801,3
62801,Hoping they don't break when I wear them on the beach.,62801,3
62802,I give it 3 stars because it was super long.,62802,3
62802,The front of the dress could be a little closer together and the back should at least have a hook or snap at the top.,62802,3
62802,Overall with a little alteration it will do for my occasion.,62802,3
62803,Top was too big and the bottoms were too small.,62803,3
62804,Would be better if the lightning bolt and the metal right next to it matched more closely.,62804,3
62804,"Was a lot bigger than expected, would definitely not try to use it like a wristlet.",62804,3
62806,The sewing quality is not the best.,62806,3
62807,GREAT FROM FAR NOT TOO GREAT CLOSE UP,62807,3
62808,This was wayyyyy too small,62808,3
62809,Cute top too short and I'm 5'1,62809,3
62810,It honestly should be less expensive.,62810,3
62810,It's not great quality.,62810,3
62810,"However, I do like it.",62810,3
62810,I love the style and length.,62810,3
62810,I just wish I were made with better material to make a better product.,62810,3
62810,Or at least the price lowered.,62810,3
62810,It really isn't worth $9 plus tax.,62810,3
62813,"Fits a little smaller than expected, but is still wearable!",62813,3
62814,"Some what small, but adorable and u can't beat the price!",62814,3
62814,I just have to do more sit-ups!!,62814,3
62815,Too long for me,62815,3
62816,Nice shirt but was just a bit small.,62816,3
62816,3x was not as loose a fit as I would have liked.,62816,3
62817,It is very cheap looking and the material it's made from feels like plastic.,62817,3
62817,"I didn't expect allot do to the price but I was unpleasantly met with really, not presentable items.",62817,3
62818,"They're really very soft and comfy, but a little on the small size.",62818,3
62819,Hard to wear for a long time as the back of it pokes my neck.,62819,3
62820,This sweater is thinner than it looks in the pictures.,62820,3
62820,I had to wear a tank top under it.,62820,3
62820,It is also much shorter than the pictures make it seem.,62820,3
62820,"I am 5'6"" and it falls at my upper thigh.",62820,3
62820,Not even near my mid thigh.,62820,3
62820,The price of this sweater was relatively inexpensive so I am not surprised about the thickness.,62820,3
62820,I wanted this to wear with leggings but it is too short for me.,62820,3
62820,I like more coverage with leggings.,62820,3
62821,"comfortable material, fit well,",62821,3
62822,Gave this 3 stars because the chain clasp broke the 2nd time I wore it.,62822,3
62822,I wanted to put a different clasp on it anyway because it is very difficult to put on by yourself.,62822,3
62822,But for $2 it was worth the 10 minutes to took to revamp it because it is so very cute!,62822,3
62823,Love the heavy material and structure.,62823,3
62823,A bit longer than expected on my short legs.,62823,3
62823,Measurements were way off.,62823,3
62824,Ok product fits a bit small.,62824,3
62825,"I like the sweater,but it is a little bigger than I expected.",62825,3
62825,I might have gotten one size smaller.,62825,3
62825,Works great if you're layering.,62825,3
62825,The sweater is very soft,62825,3
62826,I loved the jacket it was a little small and thin so i gifted it to my 12 year old neice.,62826,3
62826,She LOVES it....now i gotta find me a jacket  lol,62826,3
62827,"The top will work, but it's not bright white like the photo shows.",62827,3
62827,"The fabric is a bit sheer, so I will wear to cami under it.",62827,3
62828,"Cute, but pretty cheaply made.",62828,3
62830,the arms are very small.,62830,3
62831,Ended up having an odd fishy smell.,62831,3
62832,Not very impressed with product at all.,62832,3
62832,"Shipping was 3 weeks late, the shirt was not as portrayed in pictures.",62832,3
62832,I like the material of the shirt.,62832,3
62833,Broke after a few months.,62833,3
62834,Love the design a little small for me should have went up a size,62834,3
62835,"opal is not at all like an opal
the rest were nice",62835,3
62836,Its a good quality but it is way to big in the top compared to the bottom.,62836,3
62837,It's beautiful but about 5 sizes too large for me.,62837,3
62838,Material is not that great.,62838,3
62838,Also length is a little short and I am 5'4 and 20 weeks - I'd say it's a little lower than mid thigh.,62838,3
62839,Loved it at first-- but has already broken.,62839,3
62839,So sad because I was going to order another for a friend.,62839,3
62840,came w this really aggressive off putting smell doesnt even go away when I wash it besides that it's pretty cute a little small but thats meant for sexiness,62840,3
62841,i really like this blouse.,62841,3
62841,i even ordered a size up.. very pretty though,62841,3
62842,Material and fit are ok.,62842,3
62842,"The shirt is more peach than pink, so it's closer to Zoidberg out of his shell than in.",62842,3
62842,The image is much larger than pictured.,62842,3
62842,The eyes make it look like I have breasts.,62842,3
62842,My wife said she won't go out in public with me wearing this shirt.,62842,3
62843,I love this dress.,62843,3
62843,I purchased one in green and one in red.,62843,3
62843,Keeping it as I am hoping to lose weight.,62843,3
62844,Fit is fine and dress is nice but way too thin of material - I will have to unfortunately return it,62844,3
62846,next time upload the correct picture with the correct color,62846,3
62847,For women with narrow hips,62847,3
62848,More snug then other Cali republic hoodies .,62848,3
62848,I think it's a different material but overall nice,62848,3
62849,It's pretty and the material is ok.,62849,3
62849,The skirt is kinda cheap but everything is stiched properly.,62849,3
62849,The neckline was also somewhat higher than in the picture and the size seems to run a little big.,62849,3
62852,Hard to get on and really won't stay for too long.,62852,3
62854,This coat is not warm.,62854,3
62854,"The fit is odd on me, tight across the chest and huge everywhere else.",62854,3
62854,"I like it ok, but just ok.",62854,3
62854,It is nice and long.,62854,3
62855,Somewhat small and cheap made material.,62855,3
62856,"The fabric is very hot, but overall it is okay.",62856,3
62856,I probably won't buy another one.,62856,3
62857,"Ok, runs a little small",62857,3
62858,I am rather hippy so the blouse fit at the top but not around my hips.,62858,3
62858,There were slits at the bottom sides but still not enough to accommodate my usual large size hips.,62858,3
62858,Ended giving it to a friend as she headed to Costa Rica.,62858,3
62859,The quality is nice but it is VERY large.,62859,3
62860,"Not The quality and good looks of the picture fit for people of smaller size bought a large and still small on mke and i am a skinny guy and my other friend is short, yet its still nice looking but get a lint roller you will need it",62860,3
62861,"Waist fits ok, thighs are really loose, ankles barely fit over work boots, and are a little long.",62861,3
62861,"Good quality pant, just a bad design for me",62861,3
62862,Its made of nice quality materials however the sizing is very small.,62862,3
62862,Other than that I have no complaints about this product even the screen print held up during the wash.,62862,3
62863,"These are fine, but not exactly high quality.",62863,3
62864,the ring is nice since I'm a big fan of the Saints but the part that closes is to small,62864,3
62865,"Turquoise is pretty but looks somewhat mismatched against the tiny, fake gemstones.",62865,3
62865,"Then again, it was like only five dollars.",62865,3
62866,"This is a beautiful dress, but from the pictures you can't really tell that it is completely see-thru, with little tiny bra cups.",62866,3
62866,I bought this dress for my 16-year-old's junior prom.,62866,3
62866,I had to have the bodice lined in order for her to wear it.,62866,3
62867,We ordered the wrong size,62867,3
62868,Bottoms are very small and the top is too big in comparison,62868,3
62869,"Too big, even for a big man!",62869,3
62870,The photo makes the three colors really pop.,62870,3
62870,When received - not so much.,62870,3
62870,"They are pretty and delicate, but subdued.",62870,3
62870,"If I had ordered for myself, I would have kept them, but as gifts, they just didn't make the statement I was hoping.",62870,3
62871,This cross pendant is absolutely beautiful but it's HUGE!!!,62871,3
62871,I mean blingy flashy HUGE.,62871,3
62871,Much MUCH to large to wear daily.,62871,3
62871,My husband would never wear something this big around his neck.,62871,3
62871,"Like I said, it's beautifully made but really much too large for a cross pendant.",62871,3
62871,I returned it for a refund.,62871,3
62873,"Although the upper half seems to be longer than the lower half, and the shorts seem a little too short I'm still fine with it and wear it in the pool.",62873,3
62873,I should've went 1 size up maybe..,62873,3
62874,"It worked for a while, but the metal started to come out and poke me in the sides.",62874,3
62874,Id say you're good for about a month before you'll have to get a new one.,62874,3
62875,These are adorable and well made.,62875,3
62875,They fit as expected.,62875,3
62875,The reason I only gave them 3 stars is the fact that they appeared to be in stock but then 2 of the 3 sizes I ordered shipped from China and were a different color of green.,62875,3
62875,"Considering the fact that I bought 3 pairs because I wanted them to match for my boys & arrive at the same time, I was a bit bummed.",62875,3
62876,These leg warmers are comfy and soft.,62876,3
62876,They're a bit see through.,62876,3
62876,I usually wear them with leggings.,62876,3
62876,They arrived earlier than expected.,62876,3
62877,Shirt material is soft and accurately picturedo.,62877,3
62877,"But the chiffon material that is over the front is not as dark as pictured, it's more of a cornflower blue, not a royal blue.",62877,3
62878,"Item was as described, dimensions were smaller than I hoped but that had more to do with me than the item itself.",62878,3
62878,The color is as shown on the page and the quality appears average.,62878,3
62878,Have not yet had an opportunity to use it so uncertain how well it fits under the seats or holds up over travelling.,62878,3
62879,"This dress is beautiful, however  it is cut much smaller than expected .",62879,3
62879,you need to go a size larger.,62879,3
62880,"The good points are that it is a lovely skirt, and is elegant.",62880,3
62880,The down side is that I've worn it 3 times and it appears that the elastic band is starting to buckle up which is making the skirt lay awkwardly.,62880,3
62880,It almost looks like it is stretching out.,62880,3
62880,"Also, if you get one snag the material will run like hosiery.",62880,3
62880,"Having said all this, I would buy it again because I love the way the material feels and flows.",62880,3
62881,I ordered medium thinking they run small but it ended up being too large especially for the top.,62881,3
62881,I'll have to return it and get smaller size.,62881,3
62882,Nice blazer for price.,62882,3
62883,"It's nice, just not as flowing as shown, which is disappointing.",62883,3
62884,I ended up giving them to my daughter that's 6.,62884,3
62884,She's pleased with it.,62884,3
62885,I'm torn between rating this 3 or 4 stars!,62885,3
62885,"To get 7 items for $9 is pretty great, but there are some downfalls:
*Elephant rings are adjustable (see pic) which screams cheap.",62885,3
62885,"Since there are three, it would have been nice to have all different sizes, which would provide different finger options.",62885,3
62885,*Elephant ring left a small dark band (see pic) and will probably turn my finger greenish after a few wears.,62885,3
62885,"However, the rings are fun and shiny and I'll enjoy wearing them.",62885,3
62885,"The non-elephant rings are not adjustable, and they seem to be of better quality.",62885,3
62885,"The bracelet is nice too, and looks as described.",62885,3
62885,"I've bought cheap jewelry like this before, and have been surprised by the decent quality that you can often find with items that are priced so low.",62885,3
62885,See the picture of the two moon-turquoise rings side by side.,62885,3
62885,"One was from a different set of rings that I bought months ago, and have worn every day since.",62885,3
62885,"The shiny one is the one that came with this set, and I'm using to replace the duller version.",62885,3
62885,Some say you get what you pay for.,62885,3
62885,"I'd say with this, you get more than you pay for, but not a lot  more.",62885,3
62887,"I saw the reviews and knew this coat ran small, so I ordered a medium (I usually wear a small).",62887,3
62887,"This coat is very pretty, quite ""satiny"", but not tacky.",62887,3
62887,"The sleaves and length are slightly small, but I'm the only one that notices.",62887,3
62887,"For the price and the style/material, I would buy again.",62887,3
62887,Just remember to buy 1 or 2 sizes larger if you're NOT Asian.,62887,3
62888,I wear small size but based on reviews I ordered Medium which in some cases fits OK too.,62888,3
62888,This was very tight at the chest/bust area ( my bust area is small) and it was very long almost up to my knees.,62888,3
62888,Bottom part was widely spread-with almost like maternity outfit.,62888,3
62888,I returned it with no hassle.,62888,3
62889,"Same exact top as https://www.amazon.com/iecool-Womens-Fashion-Backless-Straps/dp/B015A6C1MS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473895308&sr=8-1&keywords=iecool+Women%27s+Sexy+Fashion+Backless+Cross+Straps+Tank+Top+Shirt+Medium+Black
Its Ok fits a little weird on the shoulders.",62889,3
62889,"Im 5'7"" and 145lbs, I purchased both tops.",62889,3
62889,Ended up with one medium and one large the medium fit better but still its not right,62889,3
62890,Very cute and very soft however it is not a dress!,62890,3
62890,Beach coverup yes maybe but the material is see through and there is a slit like the sides right up the back.,62890,3
62890,I wanted to use it as a vacation dress but now will use it as a beach cover up.,62890,3
62890,Maybe even a night robe.,62890,3
62891,not as cute in person,62891,3
62892,Ended up giving this short to my daughter.,62892,3
62892,The fit was fine but the material was very itchy.,62892,3
62892,I have no complaints with anything other than that.,62892,3
62893,too tight and hurts the head when wearing,62893,3
62895,Very soft and fuzzy but they hard to attach and constantly slip down lower.,62895,3
62895,Not to mention that they look more like dog ears than cat ears.,62895,3
62896,"Honestly when it was posted such high ratings, i was thrilled due to the price.",62896,3
62896,Its a nice jacket.,62896,3
62896,Its a soft feeling jacket.,62896,3
62896,The only thing that i didn't like is that is was soooo light.,62896,3
62896,"Honestly, that day i received a few packages in the mail.",62896,3
62896,"There were 3 boxes, all medium sized (under 24"").",62896,3
62896,I was thinking that the larger and heavier box was the jacket.,62896,3
62896,I was kind of baffled when i opened it and it was something else.,62896,3
62896,"The jacket was in a plastic bag and was light as a bird (well like a crow, maaaybe?",62896,3
62896,Im used to leather jackets being kinda heavy weighted and thick.,62896,3
62896,"Its soft and says 100% REAL LEATHER, BUT actually, if there wasn't any tags, i would have thought it was PLEATHER or PU LEATHER.",62896,3
62896,Just be careful because it feels like it will rip easily (easier than the thick and heavy leather jackets).,62896,3
62896,Thats what i was looking for.,62896,3
62896,Guess i should have checked the weight of the product first.,62896,3
62896,My husband wants to keep it because it was a gift or else i would have returned it and got another one from a different seller.,62896,3
62896,But i learned a good lesson....,62896,3
62896,"If its too good to be true, well it probably is....",62896,3
62897,Not a huge fan of the mesh.,62897,3
62898,Not this size I expected,62898,3
62899,The plastic balls kept shattering and splintering around the ends with the bar.,62899,3
62899,"These are very low quality, but I guess I got what I paid for in the end.",62899,3
62900,why the sole is somelike used,62900,3
62901,The picture shows numbers on the watch face.,62901,3
62901,Actually there are not any numbers and it is difficult to tell the time.,62901,3
62902,Really not true to the size whatever size you request up it about 2 sizes .,62902,3
62903,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law.,62903,3
62903,It is very cute in person but the fabric has an extremely unpleasant odor.,62903,3
62903,"I have been airing it out before I give it to her, in the hopes that the smell will dissipate.",62903,3
62904,This runs a little small.,62904,3
62904,Go up a size,62904,3
62905,"If you get a snag it can unravel, hard to fix if you don't know how to fix it!!",62905,3
62905,Worth the price though.,62905,3
62906,the silver sequins should have been on the back of dress,62906,3
62907,Could use some larger sizes.,62907,3
62908,Cute socks for a gift!,62908,3
62909,"First, the size issue:  I could see from the size chart that this top would run extremely small so I ordered a 3X when I really wanted an XL and that was the correct decision.",62909,3
62909,"Next, the length:  if you are 5 feet 4 inches tall, this top will practically touch your knees!!",62909,3
62909,It was a very frumpy length which made it look more like a nightshirt or a great-grandma's housedress.,62909,3
62909,My solution was to cut off the entire border on the bottom to get the correct length for me.,62909,3
62909,I used the fabric to make a scarf!!,62909,3
62909,"Next, the cheesy strings that tie the keyhole neckline together:  I tied a knot and chopped off most of the strings and only left a short length which is not too noticeable.",62909,3
62909,"Once I finished ""customizing"" this top, I ended up with a comfy shirt which will never wrinkle or shrink.",62909,3
62910,It is a bit small for me.,62910,3
62910,The picture makes it look a bit brighter than it actually is but still cute.,62910,3
62911,Was expecting better quality fabric.,62911,3
62912,"Cheap quality but, nice for a young child 8-12 yrs old.",62912,3
62913,A couple of the crystals stick out to make a pointy edge.,62913,3
62913,It doesn't hurt me but is annoying occasionally.,62913,3
62916,"Pretty dress, but very see-through!",62916,3
62917,It's meant for someone with a shorter frame.,62917,3
62917,"I'm 5' 8"" and I basically have to hunch over to fit into it, or have extreme clevage with the straps digging into my shoulders.",62917,3
62917,It's beautiful and made well and it fits every where except length.,62917,3
62918,Great design and fit.,62918,3
62918,Can even wear it across my chest.,62918,3
62918,Wish the leather was of higher quality.,62918,3
62919,The shirt is beautiful!,62919,3
62919,But I don't like the way it fits & its way to short for my liking.,62919,3
62920,Pants ripped one the second wearing when I sat down.,62920,3
62922,"Great swimsuit, but much smaller than advertised.",62922,3
62923,Was a little big,62923,3
62924,I don't think it was an extra large like i asked for.,62924,3
62925,the band pinches at time.,62925,3
62926,I think this pin is gorgeous.,62926,3
62926,"However, as soon as I put it on the pin broke off.",62926,3
62926,Luckily there is still a clip but it rides high on my jacket and it has already fallen off.,62926,3
62926,"I imagine I will lose this pin, but for now it is beautiful to look at.",62926,3
62927,"I love the quality of the leather and this is my fourth Baggu purchase, but this time the small clutch arrived scratched and with the silver logo lettering worn away.",62927,3
62927,It's still beautiful so I'll keep it.,62927,3
62927,It isn't really worth the effort to return it and wait for a new one.,62927,3
62928,Nice dress but too small.,62928,3
62928,Go up at least 2 sizes.,62928,3
62929,The straps are a little more clunky than I thought they'd be.,62929,3
62929,And it has a quote from the bible sewn on the inside - I'm not really into that stuff.,62929,3
62929,"Luckily it's on the inside, however, so I can ignore it.",62929,3
62929,"Also, I thought it would be more wallet-looking, but really just looks like a camera bag you could buy cheaply at a souvenir stand.",62929,3
62930,I MADE IT WORK,62930,3
62931,a little bit more sheer than expected,62931,3
62932,the bust area is not as advertised in measurement,62932,3
62933,"I ordered a medium according to their chart, but it was loose on me especially around the hips and the material is very thin.",62933,3
62933,My measurements are 34-25-35.,62933,3
62933,5'4 and 116 lbs.,62933,3
62933,Would think twice before ordering anything else from this company because of the material they used for this dress.,62933,3
62934,"If you're petite, this is too large for a size 4.",62934,3
62934,"I'm more top heavy and even then, things doesn't stay in place.",62934,3
62934,You would definitely have to use double sided tape.,62934,3
62936,Cute but looks like I'm having twins!,62936,3
62937,it was very big - way bigger than the posted measurements.,62937,3
62937,am going to try and reorder,62937,3
62938,XL apparently equals size 8 in US?,62938,3
62938,"I'm not sure how that works out, but I guess I can make this work since it's the largest size they offer.",62938,3
62939,Very light and breathable.,62939,3
62939,My main issue is I almost always wear 2x and it hugged my body and my bra showed through slightly.,62939,3
62939,Buy up a size.,62939,3
62939,"Other than that, fantastic for warmer weather and travel.",62939,3
62939,"I'm 5'10"" and wear about a 22/24 shirt.",62939,3
62940,"Really cute dress, but tight tight!",62940,3
62942,Wrong style for me,62942,3
62943,"But the snaps kept coming undone, perhaps because the fit was tighter than expected.",62943,3
62943,"My boys barely fit into 18 mo and we ordered 18mo- 2T, so these outfits should have been huge (we expected to fold up sleeves and pant cuffs), but they were small.",62943,3
62943,"Still, these outfits were the hit of the night (the boys stole attention away from the bride and groom)!",62943,3
62943,;-)  Super super cute.,62943,3
62943,I just wish the bottoms had a zipper or were big enough to stay connected (looking at diaper half the night was frustrating).,62943,3
62944,I thought I was ordering a burgundy dress.,62944,3
62944,It also runs very small compared to sizing in most brands.,62944,3
62944,"Make sure you size according to their chart, not what you normally wear.",62944,3
62944,"Because of the color issue, it's going back.",62944,3
62945,Good but didn't come on the dated requirements,62945,3
62946,Item ran a little small,62946,3
62947,It fits as expected and I really love the color.,62947,3
62947,"However right from the moment I put it on the zipper was distorted because it would go up about 4"" then just stop.",62947,3
62947,After a few days I was going nuts.,62947,3
62947,With two young kids to dress and get ready to leave the house (on time or early if I'm lucky) I simply don't have time to fuss with a stuck zipper.,62947,3
62947,I was about to return it when I noticed if I put pressure just right at the right spot the zipper moved fine.,62947,3
62947,So I've been doing that.,62947,3
62947,It's not perfect but I really loved this color and the cost is very warm here in CT for winter.,62947,3
62947,So I'm keeping it but wish the zipper were better quality.,62947,3
62948,"I am 5'3', athletic build, normally a size 8 in most of women's dress shirts.",62948,3
62948,This size 8 was not too baggy (the sleeves more than anything).,62948,3
62948,"The size 6 fit me snugly, not tight at all around the chest.",62948,3
62948,The quality is okay for a shirt to be worn on several occasions.,62948,3
62948,"The shirt has a firm starch collar with a built-in flexible collar stay, and comes with cheap plastic removable buttons.",62948,3
62948,"There are many loose threads and the construction is not the best of quality and stitching, but overall still wearable.",62948,3
62949,Very heavy and ribbon straps won't tighten enough,62949,3
62950,I was disappointed in the quality,62950,3
62953,"The dress fits great, except in the bust.",62953,3
62953,"For girls with bigger curves on top, this sequined straps makes the top too small.",62953,3
62954,I normally wear a size large and these fit my 10 year old daughter perfectly.,62954,3
62954,Way to small and very see through.,62954,3
62954,Great for pajama pants.,62954,3
62956,"was given as a gift, she liked it",62956,3
62957,"Yeah I can't get it in, like I don't know how to put in both holes around the anchor because it doesn't come off.",62957,3
62958,I am returning and hope to buy the next size (or maybe two sizes )up,62958,3
62959,came broken at the link.,62959,3
62959,"was cute ,but couldn't wear",62959,3
62960,Nicely made but bodice is too tight compared to the rest of the dress.,62960,3
62961,"I really liked the design that is an open ring, it's very adjustable, but it fell off my finger on the second day.",62961,3
62961,"And to me, it did not look much like a cat.",62961,3
62962,"I'm a 34B cup and i was spilling out of this bathing suit, the cups are made very small and have no padding.",62962,3
62963,"Really cute hat, but is way to small, I'd recommend it for a 8 year old but thats about it.",62963,3
62964,The real one is not as pretty as on the picture.,62964,3
62965,I absolutely love these leggings.,62965,3
62965,The fabric is a little light weight but not real see-through.,62965,3
62965,I wear about a size 3-5.,62965,3
62965,"I wold not recommend anyone over a size 7-9 buy these, because the leg parts hardly fit over my legs and the waist was only slightly more stretchy.",62965,3
62966,"Great for the first month I had them, but after that I had worn them out.",62966,3
62966,I had to go buy a different pair within 45 days of ordering these insoles.,62966,3
62967,Great ugly Christmas sweater!,62967,3
62967,Light up part of the sweater did not work though,62967,3
62968,Don't like the rope it come with the picture did not do justice....to me not worth buying,62968,3
62969,smaller then I thought it would be.,62969,3
62970,The blue shirts bled in the wash.,62970,3
62970,I think that will stop after a few washes.,62970,3
62970,They fit well though.,62970,3
62971,"Looks great, very light weight and all one piece.",62971,3
62971,"Only concern is how flexible it is, seems like it won't hold its shape for very long.",62971,3
62972,It is too small.,62972,3
62973,"Very cute, but sizing is all off.",62973,3
62973,Bikini top is alright but runs small.,62973,3
62973,The skirt is HUGE and LONG!,62973,3
62973,I don't know how this would for the average person.,62973,3
62973,"If you have the time, I recommend purchasing this, but fixing it it with sewing or safety pins to fit you.",62973,3
62974,I have been suffering from planter fasciata and everyone recommended I try Vionic sandals.,62974,3
62974,I do not notice any difference in my condition.,62974,3
62974,My heel still hurts.,62974,3
62974,I don't think it was worth spending the extra money on these shoes.,62974,3
62974,Rest and ice are the only thing that helps.,62974,3
62975,It's very cute but the fabric is very thin.,62975,3
62975,Good for summer but don't think it would last over a season.,62975,3
62976,This is no way a true 3x.,62976,3
62976,"I may be able to make this work, but it's super snug for a 3x.",62976,3
62976,"If you are tall, it's a bit short, but doable.",62976,3
62977,"Cute, but I have a large chest, so what should be a long shirt seems pretty short on me.",62977,3
62977,"I have to wear an under shirt, which I might need because it is somewhat sheer anyway.",62977,3
62978,When you zippered it up it eas to tight in the stomach area,62978,3
62980,"I like it, not as long as shown on the picture, but I can work with that",62980,3
62981,"I thought it was the one, since wife picked it out, but alas it too was returned.",62981,3
62982,"The shirt is full/baggy all over, just like the picture shows, but the material at the bottom of the shirt is tighter (almost like shirts with elastic at the bottom, but without the elastic - so there's no give).",62982,3
62982,"I would say go up a size, but the rest of the shirt would probably be too baggy.",62982,3
62982,I think it would be a great fit if you have a very slim waist.,62982,3
62983,This top is really cute.,62983,3
62983,"HOWEVER, the mesh material on the inside of the sleeves where sequins are located is quite scratchy and was bothersome.",62983,3
62984,looks cheap but is very sexy,62984,3
62985,Really cute but go up a couple sizes if you have any breasts.,62985,3
62986,So when I ordered there was no place to select a size.,62986,3
62986,"After reading the reviews that say some women with larger breasts than me were ordering and saying that they fit great, I went ahead and ordered in White and black.",62986,3
62986,They came quicker than expected but It was so small I could barely stretch it on.,62986,3
62986,"I am 5'6, 145 lbs, and wear a 36C.",62986,3
62986,"I am also very fit, but If a sports bra makes me look like I have biscuts bulging from a can then I don't wear it and would say that it's way to small!",62986,3
62986,"If there were sizes I would order again just in a bigger size, but there isn't so I won't order again.",62986,3
62986,And since I only paid 3.50 it's not worth returning.,62986,3
62988,But it ran small!,62988,3
62989,Nice top bottom is very thin material.,62989,3
62989,Get this style in a darker color if you can.,62989,3
62990,Ok if you want a warm hat.,62990,3
62990,"If this had been lightweight cotton, i would give it 5 stars but even though there are open spaces.",62990,3
62990,the acrylic yard is much too warm for spring/summer days.,62990,3
62991,"The idea is great,but our son has pillow too feet and very thick legs,didn't work for us",62991,3
62992,"Very cute necklace however, after wearing it for less than 10 minutes, it becomes a tangled mess.",62992,3
62992,Doesn't stay layered out as shown in the picture.,62992,3
62992,"But when it is sitting correctly, it is very cute.",62992,3
62994,"But one of the roses came off before night was over....
May purchase again... they were very very pretty!!",62994,3
62995,Nice quality shirt but the size runs at least 2 sizes too small.,62995,3
62995,I ordered a 2x for my husband and he couldn't even begin to close it much less button it.,62995,3
62995,He has many Hawaiian shirts and most fit fine in just an XL.,62995,3
62995,"Maybe this was just a mislabeled run, but it's definitely much smaller than a 2XL.",62995,3
62995,Unfortunately I will be returning it.,62995,3
62996,It's ok around the waist but it's not big enough for the package,62996,3
62997,XL was more like a Medium.,62997,3
62998,It's super cute and my daughter loves it.,62998,3
62998,But to step into it it was super tight and the sequence was rough on her arms and shoulders.,62998,3
62998,I got her a size bigger and it's too small it just fit her but she isn't comfortable in it we need a bigger size and they don't make it.,62998,3
62999,chain broke after a couple times of wearing,62999,3
63000,"Although the size says, ""Large"", it was more like a size 4.",63000,3
63000,The fabric was of good quality though.,63000,3
63001,This Chinese-made hat took a long time to arrive.,63001,3
63001,"The material is thinner than the other wool newsboy hats my wife wears, so she wasn't that happy with the look (it doesn't quite flop on your head like a real newsboy hat) and gave it away.",63001,3
63002,Order a size bigger it's really tight wish seller made a note in description I like it I just turned it into a neckalce,63002,3
63003,"Warm, looks good but the quality isn't there.",63003,3
63003,I has to see the trim back on the sleeves after 1 wearing,63003,3
63004,cute skirt vibrant colors not as long as picture shows... if you have a ample derriere skirt will rise!,63004,3
63005,beautiful yellow  necklace.,63005,3
63005,The only reason I gave three stars because some of the pieces came undone.,63005,3
63006,The color is more teal than emerald like the picture.,63006,3
63006,The horizontal pleats near the shoulders do not lay flat.,63006,3
63006,They stick out awkwardly.,63006,3
63006,"I haven't worn the dress, but don't want to go through ugh the trouble of returning it.",63006,3
63007,Just a tad too small.,63007,3
63007,If you bend them just a bit you may get them to work.,63007,3
63007,Definitely on the smaller end.,63007,3
63008,"These shirts are good quality and all, but MUCH lighter than I expected.",63008,3
63008,I'm military and if you are too- then these are not in regs and you shouldn't buy them (because they're too light).,63008,3
63008,Other than that- they're good shirts for civilians.,63008,3
63009,I do not like the padding that moves around & I don't like the fastener in the back.,63009,3
63010,I'm returning it Sizing is too confusing!,63010,3
63011,Nice quality runs a little small,63011,3
63012,"nice for a week or two, then starts to tarnish",63012,3
63013,Too few pockets for cards.,63013,3
63013,"If you have only a couple of cards, it's OK.",63013,3
63013,"But if you have several cards, drivers license, and other cards it is too small.",63013,3
63014,Material wasn't all that bottom was stretching but when I pulled the top of of the bag it looked just like a scarf.,63014,3
63014,No boob support and it didn't come with intruction on how to wrap it on you.,63014,3
63014,I also wish I knew other ways to put the top on at least..,63014,3
63015,"The top fit a tab small, but okay.",63015,3
63015,The shorts were more like panties than shorts.,63015,3
63016,cute little smal but ok,63016,3
63017,"These are nice, thick pants.",63017,3
63017,I ordered a 3t which fit my tall 2 year old nicely.,63017,3
63017,"However, they shipped from China and by the time I received them, I had purchased other pants.",63017,3
63017,"When I requested information to return them, the company offered a 30% refund due to the cost of international shipping rates.",63017,3
63017,"These are a nice product, just don't plan to return them.",63017,3
63018,It's a stranger design than I was expecting.,63018,3
63018,It buttons very low so it looks great with a shirt and tie.,63018,3
63018,Any other clothing the style doesn't really match.,63018,3
63018,I'm 5'9 175 and a medium fit me perfectly.,63018,3
63018,Satisfied but not thrilled.,63018,3
63019,Very weak metal this ring has already fell apart,63019,3
63020,Perfect for people with long legs.,63020,3
63020,Not great for petite.,63020,3
63021,"The product is the same as the picture, excellent conditions, even tho there were problems and my product almost get lost, but it's okay",63021,3
63022,3 stars even though I really like it.,63022,3
63022,The first day one of the bones worked its way out of the fabric.,63022,3
63022,3 days in and a stitch came loose and unraveled part of it.,63022,3
63022,"It fits as expected, and it is comfortable (besides being poked by the steel bone).",63022,3
63023,Boobs are a little too big for this.,63023,3
63023,Pads are too small.,63023,3
63023,"Straps are tight around my back, like to twist and bunch.",63023,3
63023,Hard to straighten them out.,63023,3
63023,Will be taking out the pads and will still wear it.,63023,3
63024,"Ot was awesome, but too big",63024,3
63025,I think they make the jacket too small through the shoulders.,63025,3
63025,"It was a great looking jacket, made well, and well sewn.",63025,3
63025,"My wife wears a medium, but the large was too small and tight through the shoulders and back!",63025,3
63026,I received my order today and was very disappointed that the bra that is advertised as being red is very clearly orange.,63026,3
63026,I bought this three pack because I wanted the red bra.,63026,3
63026,"Probably not worth sending them back for the price, but very frustrating.",63026,3
63026,I won't be ordering again.,63026,3
63028,The quality and fit are good.,63028,3
63028,The bill however angles downward cutting off my child view of anything except his toes.,63028,3
63028,"I find my self folding the bill up so he can see, but that defies the point of the sun protection.",63028,3
63029,Small and snug in the arms.,63029,3
63029,Passed it on as a gift to a woman half my size.,63029,3
63030,This purse is very cute and large.,63030,3
63030,However when i received it the inside zipper wasn't stitched so that's a big hole and the pocket inside the zippered area has a hole in the bottom.,63030,3
63030,"The ""leather"" (plastic ) is noticeably extremely low quality.",63030,3
63030,I bought this purse intending to combine my diaper bag my purse for an upcoming vacation but I'm positive it wouldn't handle the weight.,63030,3
63030,Every time i do use it I'm waiting for the straps to snap.,63030,3
63030,Considering i spent $18 on it I really can't say i expected more from this bag.,63030,3
63031,This bag is basic and cheaply made.,63031,3
63032,Good looking watch winder.,63032,3
63032,Didn't wind all types of watches.,63032,3
63032,Cushion moves while winding.,63032,3
63033,"Looks great, itchy fabric though.",63033,3
63034,Not a major fan of this dress,63034,3
63035,"I like the design and the feel, seems good quality, however it's too big for the Surface 3 I bought it for.",63035,3
63038,"The face is very clear, but the size is small, and it is really more of a yellow than green.",63038,3
63041,"The earrings are super lightweight and gorgeous,  but when I received them the part you put through the ear had rough spots where the gold was worn off",63041,3
63042,Shirt was beautiful just like in pic but was way to small and I bought bigger than my normal size and still was to small but I gave it to my sister who is 1/2 my size and she loves it.,63042,3
63043,"I like it it's really nice, went with my outfits, but the only problem was the chain broke on it.",63043,3
63044,"Pretty designs, but the pant legs fit a bit tight at the top, rather than a true Palazzo fit.",63044,3
63045,It was a good buy but I recommend just going to the store.,63045,3
63045,The fabric was not preferred and it showed every little mistake on my body.,63045,3
63047,I like these earrings for their great orange color and design and weight.,63047,3
63047,My only problem was they kept twisting around on the night I wore them and it seemed like almost everyone I talked with was turning one of my earrings back into place.,63047,3
63047,Maybe it was my hair that kept flipping them around but I don't normally have that problem.,63047,3
63047,They are beautiful but I'm not sure I'll wear them too often because now I'll be very aware of problem and keep checking to see if they need adjusting.,63047,3
63048,"It humors me that ""sports"" is in the title of these.",63048,3
63048,"I ordered them to workout in, and I really have only done so a couple of times.",63048,3
63048,"The fabric is cheap and thin, and the waist fit is perfect, but they feel more like something I'd wear to a retro party, or in a wacky photo shoot.",63048,3
63048,"But for high intensity workouts, they just aren't cutting the mustard.",63048,3
63048,I've washed them and was nervous about doing so.,63048,3
63048,I'd give them maybe another wash or two before they disintegrate.,63048,3
63048,"Definitely a cheaply made ""fashion"" item, NOT workout gear.",63048,3
63049,I only gave this hat a 3 because it is really cute.,63049,3
63049,When it came in it was maybe 4 inches wide and really didn't have stretch to it...,63049,3
63049,It barely fits my daughters newborn baby doll head and I'm just hoping I can get a least a week out of it when we have our baby.,63049,3
63049,It does look exactly like the pic,63049,3
63050,its ok for the price but the fabric its a little bit cheap,63050,3
63051,The inside zipper sticks out and is scratching when being warn.,63051,3
63051,The fabric was not what I expected.... its too flowy and shiny.,63051,3
63051,I ordered black but you can still see through it....so wear a slip.,63051,3
63052,Kind of cheap material ...,63052,3
63052,But it's great still have and wear every Now and then ..,63052,3
63053,If you are busty or 2 sizes up,63053,3
63054,"Love this but not made very well, seams are coming apart.....",63054,3
63055,It runs small so it just fits but it's tight on me.,63055,3
63056,"I liked that the ring is very sturdy and the right size I was looking for, but it is very hard to use.",63056,3
63056,It does not even bend a little to fit in.,63056,3
63058,"So I like it, but it's a bit annoying that you can't order the top and bottom as separate sizes.",63058,3
63058,"The top is almost too big, and the bottoms are too small.",63058,3
63058,I have little to no fat on me and the bottoms even give me a little side spillage.,63058,3
63058,I definitely have a bigger butt and smaller top so I wish I could have gotten a small on top and large on bottom since it seems to run a little small.,63058,3
63058,I like the material but as an already small person it makes me feel like even I need to lose weight to wear it!,63058,3
63058,So really unless you're the same size on top and bottom then I'm not sure exactly how much I would recommend this product.,63058,3
63058,Also the bottoms are cuter than the top.,63058,3
63058,"I wish I could just send the top back, and exchange the medium bottoms for a large.",63058,3
63058,Definitely a good price compared to Triangl and a good knockoff.,63058,3
63058,I got it basically just because I really liked the neoprene not because I wanted Triangl (I think they might do one size top and bottoms too though).,63058,3
63058,WHAT IS UP WIT DAT,63058,3
63059,Lingerie is one of my favorite things in the bedroom.,63059,3
63059,"The look, the feel, the the intrigue.",63059,3
63059,Whats not to like.,63059,3
63059,This cute peekaboo baby doll is very sexy and elegant.,63059,3
63059,It comes packaged with a matching pair of panties.,63059,3
63059,The fabric is sheer and soft and looks very good on my wife.,63059,3
63059,This is a pretty decent set for the price.,63059,3
63059,It fit my wife just as we expected it would.,63059,3
63059,The only complaints we have are the Stitching is not good at all.,63059,3
63059,"We managed to tear it in a couple spots and were not being rough with it, The lace is made cheaply as well and had snags in it from the factory, Last the panties are really just a ribbon that acts as a thong in the back, but also in the front.",63059,3
63059,Overall i give this 3 stars.,63059,3
63059,"Its not our favorite piece, but for the price and with a few adjustments made at home it will be one we will enjoy for as long as it holds up.",63059,3
63059,I am an avid amazon review and pride myself on providing quality reviews that I think would help others in deciding if this is a product for them.,63059,3
63059,All my opinions are my own.,63059,3
63059,If you have any questions please ask.,63059,3
63061,I wear it as a robe.,63061,3
63062,"Love the colors and fit, but a little see through.",63062,3
63062,Many reviews said they weren't so I was surprised to find they were on the thin side.,63062,3
63063,It looks a bit cheap for the price but it is ok aotherwise,63063,3
63064,It's hard to get on and off at times.,63064,3
63064,"The mask smells pretty toxic, as well.",63064,3
63065,I feel like I have been ripped off.,63065,3
63065,The quality of the dress is so cheap.,63065,3
63066,Very snug in some areas but it was cute overall,63066,3
63067,"I love the print, but the scarf had a very gross fishy smell.",63067,3
63067,I think its gone now that I have washed it....,63067,3
63068,The material is not good .,63068,3
63068,u can not find care lable anywhere in the coat.,63068,3
63068,"The first time shopping here ,very disappointed.",63068,3
63069,"I am usually a size 12 dress size, I have a 38 D cup size so I ordered the XL dress.",63069,3
63069,The dress absolutely has NO room for any kind of chest.,63069,3
63069,If you have any type of bosom DO NOT ORDER this dress.,63069,3
63069,I am going to return.,63069,3
63069,Other than that it was cute.,63069,3
63070,I was so excited to get this but after trying it on it will never be what I had expected.,63070,3
63070,It's very narrow so you can't wear it by itself and the sleeves give off a t-Rex look.,63070,3
63070,If only it was a few inches longer and wider it would be perfect.,63070,3
63070,Otherwise the fabric and color are both nice and I may be able to wear with a cami or sundress once the weather warms up.,63070,3
63071,looks as pictured lost 2 stars because the visor is flimsy I thought it was like a metal material or stronger,63071,3
63072,I ordered this for my daughter.,63072,3
63072,It's very cute and she likes it but it's a little bit small.,63072,3
63072,She is a woman's size medium.,63072,3
63072,"She is 5'5"" and 125 lbs.",63072,3
63072,We ordered her a large based on the reviews and it is still a little bit small.,63072,3
63072,I would order a size or two bigger than what you would normally order.,63072,3
63073,"Color does not match what I received, but they are beautiful",63073,3
63074,"Very cute print, and fits nicely, but was disappointed with the color,  the brown is an ugly brown.",63074,3
63074,Will be returning for another color.,63074,3
63075,"Does not run true to size, will have to wear over a tee",63075,3
63076,I ordered a medium shirt but you definitely want to order to sizes up I should of gotten a large.,63076,3
63077,"Cute top, but the blue is not royal blue as it appears in the photo.",63077,3
63077,It's more of a faded denim blue.,63077,3
63077,I ordered 2 sizes up & it is still a tiny bit small.,63077,3
63077,Order at least 2 sizes up.,63077,3
63078,"large means medium, order a size up from this vendor.",63078,3
63078,i had to return (which was painless thanks to amazon locker).,63078,3
63078,The XL i then order fit my L frame perfectly and was of great quality.,63078,3
63079,Ok. Good room but zippers are already starting to come off track.,63079,3
63080,3 stars because I loved the suit but the bottoms were just too big.,63080,3
63080,"I'm 5'2"" 105lbs and the bottoms moved away from my body when I walked.",63080,3
63080,So sad because it really is such a cute suit!,63080,3
63080,Wish they had XS,63080,3
63081,"Love the look, but it's too big, keeps falling off my shoulders.",63081,3
63082,Will be great to wear to an upcoming party.,63082,3
63082,Reasonably priced and they shipped very quickly.,63082,3
63083,Size runs really small,63083,3
63084,it was an iron on not metallic like i thought,63084,3
63085,These were too small for my nipples and I had to take them out because they hurt really bad.,63085,3
63085,"I've been wearing 5/8"" nipple rings.",63085,3
63085,These are just a bit too small.,63085,3
63086,"This was nice quality, but I had to return it as it was skin tight.",63086,3
63086,I bought an XL - and usually wear a medium.,63086,3
63086,This would be fine if you were going to cover it up with a jacket and are not self-conscious about tight clothing.,63086,3
63087,it looks decent for the price but way too small,63087,3
63088,The dress was larger than I expected and I order the same size dress that I always order.,63088,3
63088,I look like I am literally drowning in the dress and will have to add some type of belt or something so that I can maintain some type of shape in it.,63088,3
63088,"Love the material though, very soft.",63088,3
63089,"It's beautiful BUT , the top ball doesn't fasten tight enough and lost it in the shower within a week .",63089,3
63089,had to replace it with a different one,63089,3
63090,I'm a size 4 and buy a dress medium.,63090,3
63090,I was a little loose,63090,3
63091,"Nice print on rayon, but ordered an XLG and came as XXSML so had to pass it on to my little sister.",63091,3
63091,"Made in China, well priced, and you get what you pay for.",63091,3
63093,I would really like these but for 2 things.,63093,3
63093,One they are a little see through!,63093,3
63093,"Two at 5'7 most pants length fits me perfect, occasionally I will have to order a tall in something.",63093,3
63093,These pants however are at least 6 inches too long for me as in 6 inches are dragging on the ground when I put them on!,63093,3
63093,I gave them to my aunt who is 6 foot and all legs fit her perfect.,63093,3
63095,"Its okay, I love the design and fabric but its way too small for me.",63095,3
63095,I would have preferred it a little longer too but I would need to order a 3XL to fit me...I ordered an XL as per the size guide and it was too small still.,63095,3
63096,"I like the suit, but I am going to have to sew the breasts pads into the lining of the suit to make them stay in place.",63096,3
63097,"It was okay, the color started to wear off in about 2 weeks but you get what you pay for.",63097,3
63098,This is really more of an XL.,63098,3
63098,I wear an extra large and it was a little tight for me.,63098,3
63098,I bought this for my daughter who wears a 1X.,63098,3
63098,She couldn't wear it at all.,63098,3
63099,Nice concept but the material was thin.,63099,3
63100,The design is awesome (just a bit long) but the fabric is a slick heavy polyester.,63100,3
63100,The gown doesn't flow or feel right.,63100,3
63100,It would be so much better if it were made of a soft cotton.,63100,3
63100,I doubt if many USA women would choose this fabric.,63100,3
63100,"In my opinion, if the company would make this design with a better quality fabric, they could sell this item at a higher price and have many more satisfied customers.",63100,3
63100,"Sadly, I had to return it.",63100,3
63101,This products was very small.,63101,3
63101,It was extremely tight in the shoulders.,63101,3
63101,And was very short.,63101,3
63101,Other than being small it was a very beautiful dress.,63101,3
63102,The suit itself is really cute!,63102,3
63102,I read the earlier reviews and bought a size medium & large (I normally wear small).,63102,3
63102,I ended up choosing the large top to wear because it fit me better (I have a larger top.),63102,3
63102,"The medium bottoms fit well, but the problem was that they seemed to fit like a thong!",63102,3
63102,The back was very small and there were no pictures that would lead to that assumption.,63102,3
63102,I went out and bought a different bottom because I didn't think it covered what needed covered.,63102,3
63104,"Color was beautiful, but I wasn't a fan of the material.",63104,3
63104,It was a little coarse and not a soft tulle that i expected.,63104,3
63105,"Okay so I selected fit as expected but, it doesn't.",63105,3
63105,The top part was too big - I am a 38DDD and the bottom was too small (I typically wear a 14W).,63105,3
63105,The dress looks pretty cheap but if you are wearing for one day... it would be fine.,63105,3
63105,I will try to remember to add a picture later.,63105,3
63106,It was too big!!.,63106,3
63106,I have noticed that I don't always get it right with the size for this seller.,63106,3
63106,"I am a size 12-14 but sometimes I fit better in Large, and sometimes in XXL or 2XL.",63106,3
63106,I am going to return this one.,63106,3
63107,If you normally take a large order a medium.,63107,3
63108,"Seriously, order TWO sizes up.",63108,3
63108,"Other than that, they are quite cute.",63108,3
63108,"In case you can't tell, they are see-through, which my husband loves.",63108,3
63108,"They aren't the best quality, I won't wear them much for daily use, especially under jeans.",63108,3
63108,"They are really more for bedroom attire, which is fine because they are cute, playful, and definitely show off your ""assets"" beautifully.",63108,3
63109,Very pretty but WAY too large.returned it the same day,63109,3
63111,I got a medium when I am normally a small and it was still too small in the bottoms.,63111,3
63111,But cute swim suite.,63111,3
63112,Material is too thin but it will serve its purpose as a coverup.,63112,3
63113,I am not crazy about this watch.,63113,3
63113,The picture shows the numbers and hands on the dial are easy to see.,63113,3
63113,Not so in the wrong light.,63113,3
63113,I guess the seller knew the battery was about to expire so he sent a separate new battery which I had to replace within a week.,63113,3
63114,Sexy but not for large breasted women,63114,3
63115,One of the charms broke off however the bracelet is still in great condition,63115,3
63116,"I really like this, but it does run big for an XS.",63116,3
63116,"I will use it anyways, thanks.",63116,3
63117,"Feels poorly made, but if you take care of it it will look nicer than it really is.",63117,3
63117,The color matches the one described in the picture.,63117,3
63118,I love the dress but the arms are very tight.,63118,3
63118,It actually broke open,63118,3
63119,"Wish this hat was bigger, or at least adjustable.",63119,3
63120,They fit really well but are VERY sheer.,63120,3
63120,I cannot wait to wear them but will need to wear something over them,63120,3
63121,"The tee shirt quality is great - thick and soft
The shirt runs small, so the medium is snug on someone who wears xs in juniors",63121,3
63122,The fabric is not a good quality but it's ok I guess,63122,3
63123,"It was a great dress, I sent it back because I didn't know it was see through.",63123,3
63124,"Not what I was looking for, if you want it to match white gold, don't pick this ring",63124,3
63125,I ordered a large thinking that it would probably shrink a bit not that I needed a large but the large fit too snug.,63125,3
63125,Material not very soft.,63125,3
63125,"I originally bought this for a gift for someone that wears a size 8, same as me.",63125,3
63126,I loved this waist trainer and wore it all the time for months.,63126,3
63126,"BUT my job entails sitting at a desk, and this one was too long, so whenever I was sitting it cut into my hips and my top underneath my bra, so it because to uncomfortable eventually and now I'm looking for a smaller-section one.",63126,3
63127,started to loose the silver color after a while.,63127,3
63128,This dress was VERY cute.,63128,3
63128,"The bottom has 3 layers BUT the top has only 1 layer which makes it sheer, I will need to put something under the dress which I hate to do, it will not match the nice details the dress already has.",63128,3
63129,Ethel look nice but two of the black stones were unstick when I received them,63129,3
63130,Very cute until you put it on then the shorts make the kid look like she is in desperate need of a diaper change.,63130,3
63131,good thing I read the reviews before ordering!,63131,3
63131,"I am a size 6, so I thought well, I should order a small.",63131,3
63131,"But after reading the reviews, I ordered an XL and took a chance!",63131,3
63131,The XL JUST FITS my waist.,63131,3
63131,"If I gain one inch, it will not fit!",63131,3
63131,"I really like the pattern, since I am a music teacher, so I have worn it a few times.",63131,3
63131,It also took FOREVER to get this in the mail.,63131,3
63131,But I do feel the price was fair.,63131,3
63132,Wish the patch was sewn on.....,63132,3
63133,***If you are considering this swimsuit the XX-LARGE is an Asian XX-LARGE.,63133,3
63133,The 4X-Large would be closer to a US XX-LARGE.,63133,3
63133,"It's a great swimsuit, just sized a little weird.",63133,3
63133,"*** Petite women will have to alter the length of the feather fabric, otherwise it does look awful.",63133,3
63134,This bag is not a large it's a small bag,63134,3
63135,"I am 5'3"" 130lbs, usually a small or medium, and I got a small and it fit perfectly except that it's way short.",63135,3
63135,I was planning to wear shorts or leggings under anyways.,63135,3
63135,But I had to return it b/c the neon yellow is way more neon and green than shown in the photo.,63135,3
63136,They are good material but really long!,63136,3
63137,"Good material and look, but way too tight.",63137,3
63137,I normally am a Medium and got a Large just in case because I have a bit of a stomach.,63137,3
63137,It just clung way too much.,63137,3
63138,"Fit was good just a bit short but I'm 5 ' 10"".",63138,3
63138,Looked good with flats.,63138,3
63138,The belt was a bit cheap looking so I wore a different belt.,63138,3
63139,These look good but I wonder about the construction.,63139,3
63139,The lens are forced into the frames and distorted at the  upper corners.,63139,3
63139,I should have known better than to buy an item with no reviews.,63139,3
63142,So I do not have a big chest so even tightening it as far as I can it still droops.,63142,3
63142,But it is beautifully made.,63142,3
63143,They are very cute and soft but they are large and my baby is 4 months old so they look like they will fit and three more months.,63143,3
63145,"Good for holding all kinds of things, but a little weak.",63145,3
63146,Runs really really small.,63146,3
63146,I wear a size 5/6 ordered a xxl and my bust was to large.,63146,3
63146,:( I truly love the shirt.,63146,3
63147,I like the product.,63147,3
63147,"But,
I started with 5 stars.",63147,3
63147,-1 star because the plastic plugs fall out of foot fitter because holes are too big.,63147,3
63147,Making it difficult to get them in the boot.,63147,3
63147,And -1 star because the handle fell off second time I used it.,63147,3
63147,I will be returning it for an exchange / replacement.,63147,3
63148,"Length good, feet small and my daughter is a petite 8.",63148,3
63148,The zipper jammed and won't go down right out of the gate.,63148,3
63148,I want to return them but my daughter wants them.,63148,3
63148,I hate dealing with returns.,63148,3
63148,"If I was say, would I order this again.",63148,3
63149,"Two words, side boob... A little too sexy for me.",63149,3
63150,"I like the look; however, it took almost 2 months for it to arrive and was too small.",63150,3
63150,I gave it as a gift to an 8 year niece.,63150,3
63151,"Fabric is nice and the color is gorgeous, but the fit was very odd.",63151,3
63151,"I wouldn't recommend them for anyone over 5' 7"", max.",63151,3
63151,"I am 5' 9"" and these were not designed with height/length in mind - both in the inseam and the ""waist"" area.",63151,3
63152,Doesn't get very warm,63152,3
63153,"Nice, but they run very small order 1-2 sizes up.",63153,3
63154,"It,s nice but Fits too small!",63154,3
63155,I'm 6mths pregnant & was looking for comfy capri's to wear.,63155,3
63155,"These are great around the waist - do a good job of putting practically no pressure in that area (which is the worst right now, can't stand any sort of pressure on my abdomen & all those ""secret-fit"" pants drive me nuts).",63155,3
63155,"But they're surprisingly tight in the thigh area...I wear a size large in the maternity clothes (was a size medium pre-pregnancy, but I've found all the medium stuff is just too tight for me now) - my thighs currently measure 23"" around (they were 22""...but so it goes).",63155,3
63155,I got the size large in these & they are just too tight...they fit - but they are SUPER thin; that mixed with the tightness...just makes me very uncomfortable (& makes me feel like my neighbors kittens could destroy these in a matter of seconds).,63155,3
63155,"I have a few other pairs of capris & pants from this brand - all size large & they fit wonderfully, which is why I find it kinda odd that these were so tight...but thankfully amazon makes it easy to return.",63155,3
63156,Love the quality..it was just too small.,63156,3
63157,"The dress was somewhat small but because of the way it's made,I could wear it without stretching the material.",63157,3
63157,It looked good with a jacket.,63157,3
63158,I'm tall and expected the length to be short on me.,63158,3
63158,There is shrinkage too.,63158,3
63159,For the money they are a deal .,63159,3
63159,"However, they are pretty thin and snag easily .",63159,3
63160,I knew what to expect after reading the reviews online.,63160,3
63160,The neck is rather strange and unfinished looking.,63160,3
63160,The material and size were fine.,63160,3
63160,"I have a very picky granddaughter, when she found out that it was not a real Ivory Ella, she told me the only reason she wanted it ,was because a portion of the price is for endangered elephants.",63160,3
63160,I guess I defeated the purpose.,63160,3
63161,But flared too much at the bottom for me.,63161,3
63161,I liked the skirt so I took it to my Tailor to have the bottom taken in.,63161,3
63162,"Nice color but weird, too small fit.",63162,3
63163,"Pretty dress, runs small and exactly what you would expect for the price you pay.",63163,3
63164,I love the concept of this dress.,63164,3
63164,The color was way off!,63164,3
63164,The bust pads were bright white so you can totally see the bust pads through the see through top!,63164,3
63164,"Other than that, everything was perfect and fit as expected.",63164,3
63164,I gave a they were giving me a hard time returning it because it is sold by ESY but shipped through amazon so they could not get it corrected.,63164,3
63165,"Although I was pleased, the sizes run large.",63165,3
63165,"Had to send back, requesting a smaller size.",63165,3
63165,Awaiting a response from the company.,63165,3
63166,The material was much thinner than I expected and the thin liner is see through also and too short.,63166,3
63166,The liner only went just below my waist at 5'6''.,63166,3
63166,Pretty for a beach cover up maybe but my bathing suits are all darker colors that would show right through so I don't think I will use it.,63166,3
63167,This is such a cozy sweater but if you want it to fit oversized like the pic then order a size up.,63167,3
63169,"I like the skull cap because it looks good, protects my bald head and absorbs sweat, but it's developed a small hole where the stitching is.",63169,3
63169,"Not a very high quality product, or the stitching isn't, at least.",63169,3
63170,I've bought style & co many times and it usually runs big so I was surprised it was so small.,63170,3
63171,I accidentally ordered a large but I'm usual a medium or a small but when it came it fit okay on the top little worried about a nip slip but should be fine but the bottoms squished my butt blubber,63171,3
63172,I just received my necklaces but what made me very disappointed is that when I opened the infinity sign necklace it did not say directioner :( it was just plain but for the paper airplane I LOVE IT!,63172,3
63173,The decorative ball is cute.,63173,3
63173,The chain is worthless.,63173,3
63173,It is almost impossible to do up and undo.,63173,3
63173,The ball glows......a tiny bit.,63173,3
63173,Plan on getting a new chain if you order this.,63173,3
63174,Loose fitting slippery material.,63174,3
63175,We're picky about work clothing and have been using Carhartt for years.,63175,3
63175,Why do these not fit true to size?,63175,3
63175,"They are a little small in the waist, necessitating an unbuttoned top button for comfort.",63175,3
63175,The next larger size would probably be too large.,63175,3
63175,Not sure if this is a fluke.,63175,3
63175,But don't have time to go through the exchange routine.,63175,3
63176,"It's a beautiful top, and I love the color.",63176,3
63176,"Unfortunately, I had to return it because it was too small.",63176,3
63177,Its good product but you need to order bigger size,63177,3
63178,It was a little large for me,63178,3
63179,Pretty large 40mm face.,63179,3
63179,"Because it has very little unused space, the watch comes across as being quite a bit bigger than typical 35mm diameter watches.",63179,3
63179,Nice leather strap rather than rubber/plastic.,63179,3
63179,Biggest issue is that it seems to run 1min slow each day!,63179,3
63179,"Maybe it's got a weak battery, but I just got it!",63179,3
63180,"Great set, I would've given the product more stars but the thumb hole in one of the mittens was incredibly too small.",63180,3
63181,I ordered a small (I'm usually xs on Women's and small on Juniors).,63181,3
63181,The top is big and loose around the shoulders.,63181,3
63181,"Odd because Asian sizes usually run small,expected it to fit just right.",63181,3
63181,It is doable but just a tad bit scared it might fall off.,63181,3
63181,The color blue and material is nice.,63181,3
63181,Still thinking whether  to keep or gift it to a friend.,63181,3
63182,"It fits as a medium, but is much too long.",63182,3
63183,"They serve the purpose of outdoor sunglass readers if your expectations are low for quality and high for ""it's ok if they fall in the pool.""",63183,3
63183,"I can read through them, but only if my head is at an appropriate angle, which strains my neck.",63183,3
63183,For the price they're ok for emergency outside reading and for not worrying about what happens to them.,63183,3
63184,"very light, durable and thin.",63184,3
63184,holds all cards in place.,63184,3
63184,A little rough to take out but not a bad struggle like some people have in newer wallets.,63184,3
63184,since it's still new I don't know about its longevity.,63184,3
63184,I did rip a $20 bill though trying to take my money out from the band.,63184,3
63184,One thing I do not like is having to Tri-fold my bills.,63184,3
63185,"I am a size 14-16 5"" tall.",63185,3
63185,"This dress is made of good construction quality, however 2 sizes two small.",63185,3
63186,The costume was disappointing b/c it was way too big.,63186,3
63186,I am 5'9 and 140 lbs and I ordered a Medium.,63186,3
63186,It was so big it looked ridiculous.,63186,3
63186,I would err on the side of ordering small if you are comfortable with it.,63186,3
63186,The material itself seems like it was good quality though and you get a lot with the costume for your money.,63186,3
63186,I was sorry that it didn't work out like expected.,63186,3
63187,My package was missing the shorts .....,63187,3
63187,It only came with one piece of the two piece set :(((((,63187,3
63188,Seller ship random colors so if you need the right color go with a different seller.,63188,3
63188,"Other then that no big problems, it's really durable.",63188,3
63188,I use it once a week and it doing great no fading or stretching.,63188,3
63190,Thought the lenses would be bigger,63190,3
63191,I wish there were more with solid colors.,63191,3
63192,This blouse was lovely and the quality was fine.,63192,3
63192,The sizing was quite small for thin arms.,63192,3
63192,I realize that the model is young but perhaps the description should indicate for junior sizes.,63192,3
63192,"Sadly, the fit didn't work for me and I returned it.",63192,3
63193,I got this hat for my 8 month old grandson.,63193,3
63193,My daughter told me it was a little tight but he still got it on.,63193,3
63194,"Unfortunately, it came with a nice sized scratch on it.",63194,3
63194,Are these not checked for quality before being packaged and shipped?,63194,3
63195,"This shirt is so cute and comfy, but it fits just as that, a shirt.",63195,3
63195,"If you're purchasing it to wear as a dress, you should probably reconsider.",63195,3
63196,This was an awkward sweater.,63196,3
63197,It's true to its picture but it doesn't pop.,63197,3
63198,Material a little thin but otherwise a good deal for the price.,63198,3
63199,"Good fit...light material, goes good alone or with a jean jacket",63199,3
63200,Too big for newborn.,63200,3
63200,This is for 15mont baby but it's very soft and cute.,63200,3
63200,3 stars are only for the size.,63200,3
63201,"The quality is good, fit was true to size but, I didn't realize that the underside of the skirt was white.",63201,3
63201,(The built in underwear is all black.),63201,3
63201,"This is not a huge deal but, when you sit down, the white underside sometimes shows which looks cheap in my opinion.",63201,3
63201,I'm keeping the product as it's sufficient.,63201,3
63202,My shirt arrived quickly and it fit as expected.,63202,3
63202,I wasn't disappointed in anything except the quality of the clothing itself.,63202,3
63202,It's made from a very cheap material and the design on the shirt I received isn't exactly the same as the one in the picture.,63202,3
63202,"I was able to wear it and feel great, but it definitely wasn't as cute as I pictured it was going to be.",63202,3
63203,Honestly the hat looked a little strange on me compared to the one i bought on campus.,63203,3
63203,"I decided to order it online because i couldn't make it down there, but it was a little too stiff for me.",63203,3
63204,it's small and it doesn't look good as picture,63204,3
63205,The swimsuit was good quality but just did not fit as I expected.,63205,3
63206,Annoyed it won't close in the front.,63206,3
63207,"I like it a lot but agree the lace hangs weird, nothing a lil fabric glue or simple stitch can't fix.",63207,3
63207,Still going to wear and love .,63207,3
63208,"I'm happy with the length although it might be too long for some, but I ordered it in fuschia and it came in WAY brighter than that dusty pink color that's shown.",63208,3
63208,"Shame, because I was looking for the color shown in the picture.",63208,3
63210,"The shirt fits nice and I will definitely wear it, but it does not fit like the picture.",63210,3
63210,"I still like it and will still wear it, but does not look as nice as the picture.",63210,3
63211,"My little one wears a size 4-5 and even then, this is large on her.",63211,3
63211,I had to sew in the back to tighten it for her.,63211,3
63211,The fabric suits its purpose and the design is really adorable.,63211,3
63211,I would recommend ordering a size smaller.,63211,3
63212,"Quality is fair, but runs small",63212,3
63213,Material was very good.,63213,3
63213,But size was way off very short and I am very petite 4'10.,63213,3
63214,I really liked these gauges.,63214,3
63214,The design is awesome.,63214,3
63214,But I've had them for a little over two months and one of them has started to fade already.,63214,3
63214,So now I have a black one and an almost white one.,63214,3
63214,That's not very good quality if they fade after only a couple of months.,63214,3
63216,"I'm normally a medium, I ordered a large to be safe.",63216,3
63216,Should have ordered an XL it runs that small.,63216,3
63216,Just using it for spray tanning.,63216,3
63216,I wouldn't suggest anyone actually wear this in public.,63216,3
63217,The costume fit fine.,63217,3
63217,But the face mask did not fit at all.,63217,3
63217,I painted my face instead.,63217,3
63217,And the gloves were too short so I ordered longer gloves to complete the costume.,63217,3
63218,Broken when I received,63218,3
63219,I really do love the item.. but it was too small!,63219,3
63219,I'm 5'4 and 150 lbs... and I followed the size chart but it couldn't even zip.,63219,3
63219,The size chart is not true to the clothing... so I couldn't wear it... wasted money.,63219,3
63220,"Material is okay I guess, will snag on sharp objects though.",63220,3
63220,Its a bit loose on the hips like it was built for women with wide hips.,63220,3
63220,"I can't wear it, can't return it.",63220,3
63220,I guess I'll adopt it and let it live in my closet with the rest of clothes I don't wear.,63220,3
63221,"It's like a size M-L, I like the style but the armhole area is a bit too small.",63221,3
63221,Also the mash trim is too soft.,63221,3
63222,"Soft, near-sheer fabric that is lightweight and comfortable.",63222,3
63222,"Crop top is definitely pretty short, I was hoping that it'd be just an inch or so longer but it's still pretty cute.",63222,3
63223,Held the earrings to tight making them uncomfortable.,63223,3
63224,"Great shirt for the money, but whatever the color Adobe means, it is not the color of the shirt pictured.",63224,3
63224,Mine arrived in a more of a red color.,63224,3
63224,Thought it would be more grey.,63224,3
63224,Great shirt if your color blind.,63224,3
63225,"They are decent quality, haven't had an issue with them so far (I don't wear them much, though).",63225,3
63225,"I will say, however, that they are definitely not truly polarized.",63225,3
63225,"I have a pair of ray-bans that are polarized and I compared them, and they're definitely not.",63225,3
63225,"But for the price I paid, I didn't expect much.",63225,3
63225,"Personally I am not a huge fan of the design and how it fits on my face, but if you're looking for a cheap look-a-like version of the ray-ban design or other designer sunglasses, they work well.",63225,3
63225,Just know that the polarized advertisement is false.,63225,3
63225,It is what it is for a great price!,63225,3
63226,"The size come smaller, I'm a medium and ordered a large and its a size small so I had to order a XL and still the bust is reduced.",63226,3
63227,Fit perfectly on my body but it was just too tight on my arms and also it was a bit tight on bust because im busty so i suggest buying a size bigger than you normally wear,63227,3
63228,Product looks just like I thought it would from information provided on Amazon page.,63228,3
63228,Quality overall is good.,63228,3
63228,"However, The one buckle on the handle keeps coming undone.",63228,3
63228,I had to sew the strap to itself in order to keep it from coming undone.,63228,3
63228,Not too happy about that.,63228,3
63228,"Otherwise, happy with it.",63228,3
63229,I wish it came with instructions on how to wrap it.,63229,3
63229,I can't figure it out,63229,3
63230,Large an with too much transparency,63230,3
63234,I took over a month to arrive!,63234,3
63234,"I'm 5' 4"", 138lbs, 34DDD
This dress doesn't fit according to the sizing which was posted by the seller, instead it runs seriously very small.",63234,3
63234,"I typically wear a small-medium 6/8 in everything so I was comfortable ordering a medium, but sadly it was too tight in the chest and hip/tummy areas!",63234,3
63234,The return process to China is expensive and not worth the costs invoulved.,63234,3
63234,The dress is a very light weight and almost see through polyester/cotton fabric; the colors are vivid and pattern is attractive!,63234,3
63235,Pretty shirt but too big on me.,63235,3
63235,I bought in a size 4 and it was not flattering on me .,63235,3
63235,"I am 129lbs  and  5'1"" and I wear small and medium sizes.",63235,3
63236,I wish there were other prints.,63236,3
63236,I love the cut of the dress.,63236,3
63237,Great style but poorly made,63237,3
63238,"Beautiful, but quite small.",63238,3
63238,Not a stretch fabric.,63238,3
63238,"I ordered the 3x, which based on the measurements provided, should have fit, possibly been slightly loose.",63238,3
63238,"I generally wear a large, sometimes an xl.",63238,3
63238,The 3x is tight.,63238,3
63238,"I can barely get my arms in it, and it definitely won't latch.",63238,3
63238,"It will probably work, but I am dissapointed that the provided size chart is so off.",63238,3
63238,Material is very pretty.,63238,3
63238,Buttons are very nice.,63238,3
63238,Craftsmanship appears to be descent.,63238,3
63238,"If it fit, I'd be very happy.",63238,3
63239,The quality was good but sizing was way too small,63239,3
63240,"My daughter had this on her list for Christmas, so I purchased it as a stocking stuffer.",63240,3
63240,I am not overly impressed with the quality and it looks cheap.,63240,3
63240,This is definitely a case of getting what you paid for.,63240,3
63242,A small is supposed to be size 7/8 but this is HUGE!,63242,3
63242,"Cute, but my very average sized 7 year old daughter who normally wears a size 7/8 won't be able to wear it for a least 2 years.",63242,3
63244,Looks great but the question of all questions is...how big is it?,63244,3
63244,Well it's bigger then I thought and I imagine it's smaller then what others think.,63244,3
63244,I put some photos to help everyone better understand what the newborn size looks like.,63244,3
63245,I love them but they are super small.,63245,3
63245,"I am usually a small but got a medium because of the reviews I read, but I should have gotten a large.",63245,3
63245,The medium is wearable but not comfortable.,63245,3
63246,"The arch support ok, but I needed my own.",63246,3
63247,you can see through,63247,3
63248,"I like the style, but it is too large for my ankle/arm.",63248,3
63249,I have given a few as gifts.,63249,3
63249,My bracelet however pulled apart and lost the magnet that connects the bracelet.,63249,3
63249,I hope my gifts hold up better.,63249,3
63250,"Large enough for my things, but not too big.",63250,3
63250,"I'm giving it 3 stars because like some other reviews, the piece that holds the shoulder strap on broke after 1 use.",63250,3
63250,I just sewed it back on with invisible thread & seems to be holding up well.,63250,3
63250,"Quality could be better, but it's a cute purse.",63250,3
63251,I normally where a Large.,63251,3
63251,Reviews suggested sizing up so I ordered an XL and it was still too small.,63251,3
63252,I bought it to go with my leopard print shoes - goes okay.,63252,3
63252,Good to wear under a sweater or jacket.,63252,3
63253,"Bought the Avenger Scarlet Witch Age for my tiny wife, size XS, and it fits well.",63253,3
63253,The leather wrist bands however must be one-size-fits all as they are an inch to big in circumference.,63253,3
63253,Jacket is from Pakistan and the leather is of the quality expected for the price.,63253,3
63253,"It won't last a lifetime, but it is a fun jacket.",63253,3
63253,The styling is successful.,63253,3
63253,With the right shirt and boots the wearer looks a bit intimidating.,63253,3
63254,Good Value delivered on time for my event!,63254,3
63255,I expected vivid colors.,63255,3
63256,I love the color and size.,63256,3
63256,"The only downfall, I put them in, and one of the diamonds was gone by the next morning.",63256,3
63258,Little tight around the bust area.,63258,3
63258,I am a 38DD and its hard to find a manufacture that understands that size in less expensive clothing.,63258,3
63258,"However, the dresses made by this manufacture is always on point.",63258,3
63258,Take note of the Asian companies you order from on these websites.,63258,3
63258,"They have their own size chart in their country and sell them to American females and they ""ALWAYS"" are too small.",63258,3
63259,The frames looked larger in the pictures.,63259,3
63259,Do like the rubber part.,63259,3
63260,I did not like how this dress fit at all on me!,63260,3
63260,Very form fitting and I felt like sausage roll in it!,63260,3
63260,The material has a litte stretch to it but it showed every bump and flaw on my body.,63260,3
63260,The color of the dress was very pretty and the blue was what I was looking for my son's wedding but sadly I decided it was not the dress I wanted to wear for the special day.,63260,3
63261,I should of paid attention when they said they ran small.,63261,3
63261,My son is 11 and they hardly went on his feet,63261,3
63262,I were a XL and it fits me between a large and medium.,63262,3
63262,Should've gotten a 4XL.,63262,3
63263,"I liked the bag very much - plenty of room, lots of pockets, sized just right (for me), material great, but the plastic zipper across the front of the bag broke a tooth as soon as I unzipped it so I had to return it.",63263,3
63263,I'd love to order another one but am very hesitant lest there be another issue like that.,63263,3
63264,"After two weeks of wearing the charm on my bracelet, it started to discolor (silver plating wearing off and a bronze color coming through).",63264,3
63264,I probably won't be keeping this one on my bracelet.,63264,3
63265,Dress didn't fit as nicely modeled...,63265,3
63265,It 's little frumpy- maybe because I am a size 12...,63265,3
63265,I don't know...But I can say it's s well made dress and I am keeping it...,63265,3
63265,It's still a lovely dress,63265,3
63266,Gorgeous but too small,63266,3
63267,Looks great but size runs very small,63267,3
63268,Really pretty for the price.,63268,3
63269,Did not the quality at all,63269,3
63271,"thought it would fit,i guess it's childs  size",63271,3
63272,i usually wear a 10 or 12 in womens size and i have curves.,63272,3
63272,"this was not a good fit, nor was it flattering.",63272,3
63272,Drop-waist + pleated skirt would make anyone look bigger than they are.,63272,3
63272,"i suggest the other style from rubies costume, which is also drop-waist but w/o pleats and with a fitted bust - much more flattering, plus it has a zipper instead of 2 velcro dots and the fabric feels much nicer than this one (they're both polyester, but this one feels and looks it)",63272,3
63273,"The fabric is great, but the fit is off.",63273,3
63273,The sizing is NOT accurate for US women.,63273,3
63274,Zipper broken when I received it.,63274,3
63274,Have to wonder if it's the quality of the garment.,63274,3
63275,A little on the light side and the band is wider then normal and tends to scratch the finger and the fingers on the sides of it.,63275,3
63276,"Very sexy on me but the only thing too small..should've ordered one more size up,don't do much returning so I'll probably be giving it away",63276,3
63277,Bit large for me,63277,3
63278,The material is very flimsy.,63278,3
63278,You'll want to wear a camisole underneath as it's see thru.,63278,3
63280,I like the style a lot.,63280,3
63280,But I wish the teardrop was just a little bigger.,63280,3
63281,"It's cute, however I'm 5'2"" and adjusting the stockings to be even takes some time sometimes and the clips come undone fairly easily.",63281,3
63282,"I ordered this with the thought that it would be a useful body shaper, and the additional glute lifter would be appreciated.",63282,3
63282,I was very wrong.,63282,3
63282,"The design makes it very uncomfortable to wear in the rear area, and creates a weird shape.",63282,3
63283,"I like the way this looks, but it irritates my skin a bit.",63283,3
63283,Going to spray with clear nail polish to keep any irritants at bay.,63283,3
63284,"ordered a large and was pretty snug, my butchers were fully exposed, I'm normally a medium in most things so i would definitely recommend ordering an XL",63284,3
63287,I purchased these mittens for my newborn...I haven't used them as of yet but I did wash them once.,63287,3
63287,"I have to say that these mittens are not well made however for the price, I expected them to be low quality.",63287,3
63287,I plan on keeping them regardless.,63287,3
63287,"After washing, a couple of the mittens started to have lose threads coming out of them and one of the mittens lost a bow (which are glued on, not sewn onto the material).",63287,3
63287,"Once my son is born, I will update with whether or not they are effective in keeping him from scratching himself.",63287,3
63288,Super cute but I had to size a whole size down for both my kids....ages 3 and 4,63288,3
63289,"The material not so good, doesn't fall well",63289,3
63290,"They look great, but within 12 hours of having them in, I noticed that 2 tunnels were stripped.",63290,3
63290,This meant that the gem screwed into it would just spin forever and never really get tight.,63290,3
63290,"It's a shame, because they really are cute.",63290,3
63292,Nice but size to small,63292,3
63293,I would have ordered a 1/2 size bigger,63293,3
63295,Broke after a couple days.,63295,3
63295,My daughters broke also.,63295,3
63296,"colors of bolts and rubber are different , otherwise fine , you get what you pay for , good customer service",63296,3
63297,"Rather big/loose for an ""XS"" but only around the shoulder area, which is disappointing as I actually have wide shoulders!",63297,3
63297,If you let this dress sit normally on your shoulders the neckline would dip quite low and expose a lot of cleavage which not everyone may be comfortable with.,63297,3
63297,"The dress is actually not that long and can't be worn as a dress on its own unless you are really short, I am 5'4"" 95 lbs when I wear this only as a dress the sides will be too short and show some booty, I had to wear leggings or shorts underneath.",63297,3
63297,"The lace hem looks pretty nice, but the coral color is closer to NEON in terms of brightness and not really a matte coral as shown in the photo.",63297,3
63298,Too long for my torso - I'm only 5'1.,63298,3
63298,A bit uncomfortable at the back.,63298,3
63298,But all in all I will keep it.,63298,3
63299,"Ordered two swimsuits one in medium because it's the size I usually wear, and one in large due to other reviews.",63299,3
63299,The large fit perfect!,63299,3
63299,Only complaint about it is that there was a stain on the top that I didn't see coming out so unfortunately I had to return both.,63299,3
63300,The dress is very pretty.,63300,3
63300,But it's a tad bit see though.,63300,3
63300,I'd have to wear a light slip during the day time hours.,63300,3
63300,But other than that it's great.,63300,3
63301,I was so excited to get this but when is came (i got a medium) it was huge!,63301,3
63301,YOU CAN NOT SHRINK THIS SO BEWARE!!!!,63301,3
63302,"The sleeves are super tight, cannot pull up at all (like to wear as 3/4 length).",63302,3
63302,"Stitching is showing at the seams because the sleeves were tight (my arms are not abnormally large or anything, probably on the small end).",63302,3
63303,The sweater was bought as an alternative to my grandma sweaters at work.,63303,3
63303,Just a little delicate.,63303,3
63303,I wore it for one day and part of the sleeve opened at the seam.,63303,3
63303,But it was nothing.,63303,3
63303,Would get 5 if the seam didn't rip.,63303,3
63303,Otherwise a good sweater.,63303,3
63304,Too much bling for me even with my big hands.,63304,3
63304,Doesn't come close to looking real.,63304,3
63305,"big of my hand, maybe my hand is small.",63305,3
63306,These are decent leggings.,63306,3
63306,Probably great for around the house.,63306,3
63306,But the do end up being a little see-through when stretched.,63306,3
63306,There is also a lot of extra fabric length wise- but I guess that's to be expected with a one-size fits all.,63306,3
63307,I order an extra large to fit over my bathing suit as I am 38 DD not even close to going over.,63307,3
63307,I gave this to my Son's Girlfriend who is a Size 2,63307,3
63308,The sizes run small.,63308,3
63309,I love the dress and it is very comfortable but the ties tore/ unraveled in just a few washes.,63309,3
63309,"Other than that, it's a very comfortable summer, lazy day dress!",63309,3
63310,The material is very thin and it only is wearable if you use another black layer under it like sliders.,63310,3
63310,That being said the graphics are really cool.,63310,3
63311,"The gown feels nice, but the buttons will not stay button in the front of the gown.",63311,3
63312,It's cute but not as red as I'd like it to be- more pink color,63312,3
63314,Shoes are cute but the design is too small.,63314,3
63314,"We bought Robeez in the next size up, and they were too big, so we thought this smaller size would be just right.",63314,3
63314,Turns out the design is a bit different than other Robeez and thus the shoe runs small.,63314,3
63314,We couldn't fit our baby's foot in them.,63314,3
63314,"So if your child usually wear Robeez in this size, then beware this style runs small.",63314,3
63315,Nice band but impossible to remove links on ur own.,63315,3
63315,Had to pay $20 to have it sized.,63315,3
63316,I like the two pair of panties that I received.,63316,3
63316,"The red is a really pretty color and is more of a true red, not an orange red.",63316,3
63316,"I'm not that fond of the nude color, but it would be OK for under light colored clothing.",63316,3
63316,The lace is pretty and soft....but my order was missing the black pair.,63316,3
63316,"I am 5' 2""  and weigh 117# and bought a medium and the panties just barely fit and are not very comfortable.",63316,3
63316,There is little stretch in the elastic also.,63316,3
63316,I would definitely go up 2 sizes.,63316,3
63316,"(The tag on mine said they were a large, so there you go, they run VERY small.)",63316,3
63316,I would not buy these again.,63316,3
63316,They are not very comfortable and I much prefer a thong.,63316,3
63316,(10/28/16  Update: The seller was very proactive and responded immediately regarding the missing pantie and is sending it to me.),63316,3
63316,(11/22  Update: I just received the new set of all 3 colors now.,63316,3
63316,"Black, red and nude.)",63316,3
63317,Thought it was hooded...uuhh no.,63317,3
63318,"Does what it is supposed to do, but after some time in it, it bunches up at certain spots, and gets a bit irritating.",63318,3
63318,Works better if it's worn over a tight tanktop.,63318,3
63319,Not slim fit for those who are actually slim.,63319,3
63319,"The sleeves fit well, but after that, it seems to have no shape.",63319,3
63319,I wear a Small Extra Fitted from Express and this shirt fits nowhere near the same.,63319,3
63319,Not even remotely similar to the picture.,63319,3
63319,"Professional packaging, some minor defects upon delivery.",63319,3
63320,"these are okay leggins, i do like them but they are pretty thin",63320,3
63321,Needs a draw string in the waistband.,63321,3
63322,Very sexy but runs a little  small,63322,3
63323,"I bought the yellow one for a costume and when you out it on you can see my underwear, spanks Everything.",63323,3
63324,Order a larger size.,63324,3
63325,The quality not really good,63325,3
63326,"The grey advertised on the picture isn't accurate; the hat came in and it's more dark, like a charcoal, than a middle-of-the-road gray.",63326,3
63326,"I will trade this in for the light gray and figure out the size issues myself, as I know I have a small head size.",63326,3
63327,"Very cute love it, but straps do not stay attached",63327,3
63328,"I ordered the dark grey wallet, I received an emerald (dark green) color.",63328,3
63328,"I wanted grey so it would match, oh well.",63328,3
63328,Wallet seems fine though.,63328,3
63330,This is a little small for the sizing and also a bit sheer.,63330,3
63330,The fabric is cool and breathable though.,63330,3
63330,Soft and nice for lounging.,63330,3
63331,It's a super cute top but runs a little small and the neck opening doesn't allow it to really hang off the shoulder like the picture.,63331,3
63332,she was happy with it,63332,3
63333,The yellow was a bit faded.,63333,3
63333,Not sure of it was supposed to be that way or not.,63333,3
63333,"Otherwise, it was a good fit and came as expected.",63333,3
63334,"The jewelry itself is very pretty, the antique detail looks really nice and the turquoise actually felt like stone.",63334,3
63334,"My complaint: the set arrived, I took it from its packaging (bubble mailer and a plastic ziplock bag) carried it upstairs to take photos of it, when I picked them up to take to my room, the charm loop (the one that attaches to the necklace) broke in half... it is made of a spray painted plastic.",63334,3
63334,"Also, the earrings should have a stronger support, the little hooks bend and the earring eventually slips from my ear.",63334,3
63335,The bag is ok on size and the quality is ok.,63335,3
63335,However the length of the strap are very annoying it keep falling of your shoulders.,63335,3
63335,I like to wear my purse around the house to try it out and I could not deal with the fact that every 10 seconds I have to keep adjusting the purse because it keeps falling of my shoulder.,63335,3
63335,Is a nice purse just didn't work out for me.,63335,3
63335,I do love the compartments.,63335,3
63336,way too long to wear with a skirt.. i'm going to have to cut them...,63336,3
63338,The set is cute and fits my son just fine...,63338,3
63338,"However after two weeks the slippers have fallen apart (think shoes that can talk, they're THAT bad!).",63338,3
63338,"I would expect this after months of wear and tear, but only wearing them in the morning and just before bed (and for just two weeks), is unacceptable.",63338,3
63339,After reading all the reviews about this fitting small I ordered a medium and it is too big on me.,63339,3
63339,"I'm usually a size 2, 34B, 34-25-35, 115 pounds.",63339,3
63339,I can still make this suit work but the bottoms are definitely looser then I would prefer.,63339,3
63339,For the price I guess it's ok but it is true that the top rides up I guess more so since I don't really have any boobs to begin with.,63339,3
63339,Maybe it would be different for someone who has larger breasts.,63339,3
63340,it was ok.  would only wear as an around-the-house shirt or as a layering shirt.,63340,3
63340,Was smaller than expected and nothing special about it.,63340,3
63340,Looked more like a shirt I could wear out in the listing.,63340,3
63340,Would not even be appropriate for working out.,63340,3
63340,Very thin material and a bright yellow.,63340,3
63341,I am very small busted & was hoping to add a little to my cup size.,63341,3
63341,I don't think I would ever wear them in a swimsuit for fear they would fall out.,63341,3
63341,"I have used them in my bra, but they don't fit in my bra real well.",63341,3
63341,You can see part of them sticking out.,63341,3
63341,Maybe they would work better in a different bra.,63341,3
63343,"I wish they would think to make the front part of the bill a bit stiffer than the rest, so that it wouldn't flop down over baby's eyes.",63343,3
63343,I am constantly having to adjust it.,63343,3
63343,"Also, having a hard plastic toggle on the back of the head is odd, since a baby might lean his head back on something.",63343,3
63344,"Great service & on time, dress, not as flowy as picture & too short.",63344,3
63345,This bag is average for the price.,63345,3
63345,It has a smell to the material and it attracts lint easily.,63345,3
63345,As far as the structure of the bag I'd only expect to get a year or so out of it using it daily.,63345,3
63345,"On the plus side, it's light weight.",63345,3
63345,It doesn't have an external mesh pocket for a water bottle.,63345,3
63345,I don't think it would protect a laptop or tablet very well as there's not much padding.,63345,3
63346,Bought this as a backup work shirt for KFC.,63346,3
63346,It served that purpose w/o being overtly expensive.,63346,3
63346,"Everyone liked the overall appearance of the shirt, but the red color does start to bleed into the central design after 2 or 3 washes.",63346,3
63346,"Also, you will more & likely need to order one size larger as the fit of this shirt is on the snug side.",63346,3
63347,"Love the dress, except the bust is VERY small.",63347,3
63347,I'm a 36D and there is not enough material to cover my chest.,63347,3
63347,This dress is not made for women with a bigger chest.,63347,3
63348,It's nice but it's too large for me I got wrong size,63348,3
63350,I wish I had listened to other reviews about the smell of these handbags.,63350,3
63350,This had such a strong chemical smell I couldn't stand it.,63350,3
63350,"Even after leaving out of the packaging for more than 3 days, the purse still smelled.",63350,3
63350,I can't imagine that this odor is healthy to breathe in.,63350,3
63350,Seller is good about refunds though so no problems there.,63350,3
63350,Too bad because the style and size were just right.,63350,3
63351,Runs big so get a size down,63351,3
63352,"I loved what I ordered but there was one downfall, my infinity sign is just that there is no directioner on it or a heart it is just an infinity symbol",63352,3
63353,It is exactly like the picture.,63353,3
63353,But the arms are too small.,63353,3
63354,Really love the look & mostly the comfort but they are a tiny bit too narrow for complete comfort.,63354,3
63355,it is too long for my torsoe,63355,3
63356,It's a really cute suit but it is tiny tiny.,63356,3
63356,"I am 5'3, petite 117 lbs and I could barely get this on.",63356,3
63356,Gave it to my teenage daughters friend.,63356,3
63356,She might have better luck.,63356,3
63358,Very cute shorts but unfortunately it runs small.,63358,3
63359,ordered larger than wanting ... this comes from China .. i suggest TWO sizes bigger,63359,3
63360,Very nice style but the circles could be larger.,63360,3
63360,"They ARE separate circles though, not soldered together, which is a plus.",63360,3
63361,I had to cut the back with a scissors about an inch because they were sooo stiff and rubbing against the back of my foot.,63361,3
63361,But now they feel great so I don't think it's because I got the wrong size.,63361,3
63362,Ordered a size up and is still too snug.,63362,3
63363,Too small had to return,63363,3
63364,Came apart after my first wear,63364,3
63365,"Fit on face uncomfortable, but still cute.",63365,3
63366,The necklace clip doest not work.,63366,3
63366,"The quality is soso for its price, it is definitely good design and look nice on me.",63366,3
63368,"Very cute, nice quality.",63368,3
63368,The only thing is that the sleeves will get strings hanging and bottom but not very much.,63368,3
63368,I love it but thats my only complaint.,63368,3
63369,"This is the second dress that I purchased from Amazon that fits like a shirt as opposed to a dress, because of the short length.",63369,3
63369,"Like the other dress, different brand, both looked to be great dresses to bring for my vacation.",63369,3
63369,"I ended up keeping both, I'll just use them as shirts instead.",63369,3
63369,"I'm 5'7"" and 150, I ordered a medium.",63369,3
63369,"Had it been longer, it would have fit perfectly.",63369,3
63370,The quality of the product its nice; but I believe the sizes are off.,63370,3
63370,"I bought the extra small size for my 2yrs old son (this supposed to be for 2-4yrs old toddlers), and it didn't fit at all,  the tshirt was too big on him.",63370,3
63370,"I ended up,  fixing it myself.",63370,3
63371,This belt is probably a little better quality than most of the belts advertised as 'genuine leather'.,63371,3
63371,"It seems to be solid leather, rather than some kind of composite man-made material, made of leather, and who knows what else?",63371,3
63371,"I was hoping for thicker leather,  It seems pretty thin for a heavy-duty, solid, leather belt.",63371,3
63371,"Also disappointing was that the finished surface of the belt was quite noticeably  scuffed on the 4 inches, or so, at the end with the holes.",63371,3
63371,"I am assuming it was because the belt was shipped in very lightweight flexible packaging, and as the belt was wound with the scuffed end on the outside of the coil, that the finished surface was damaged from some kind of rubbing in transit.",63371,3
63371,At least that is what I stated in my review of the packaging.,63371,3
63371,"I prefer to think that the packaging was at fault, and not because the belt was sold, worn a bit by someone, returned, and then resold as new.",63371,3
63371,"Although I am not sure, and the more I wear it, the more I question my theory of poor packaging as the only cause.",63371,3
63371,"On a more positive note, I must agree that this belt is better than most.",63371,3
63371,Just disappointed that it wasn't ALL that I expected.,63371,3
63372,Top fits fine but bottoms are small with not much give.,63372,3
63372,Cute suit over all.,63372,3
63373,Christmas gift for my grand sons.,63373,3
63373,Picked out by the wife.,63373,3
63374,"Material is very stretchy and fits rather large, should have went with a smaller size.",63374,3
63374,My daughter is a 14 but should have went with a 12.,63374,3
63375,Thin material to baggy,63375,3
63376,Really good liking I get a lot of compliments but it is thick and wide so it can be a little uncomfortable at times.,63376,3
63377,"It looks nice, but was smaller than I expected, so we sent it back.",63377,3
63378,It lasted 9 months before it finally fell apart.,63378,3
63378,It has been holding on by threads for weeks.,63378,3
63379,Kind of looks like a bag on me.,63379,3
63379,Does not fit as the model shows.,63379,3
63379,I look like a granny.,63379,3
63379,I love the pockets.,63379,3
63380,"Knocked off a star because the heather hunter green just looks gray, does not look olive or greenish at all like in the picture.",63380,3
63380,But i love this brand yoga pants.,63380,3
63380,They fit well and are not see-through when you squat/bend over.,63380,3
63380,These run a little large.,63380,3
63380,"I normally wear a small for bottoms, but had to order down a size to an XS.",63380,3
63380,I have bigger thighs/butt and normally can't even get an XS on.,63380,3
63380,"The size small kept creeping down, so I had to keep pulling them up all day - very annoying!",63380,3
63380,Switched to XS and they stay in place perfect.,63380,3
63381,"i prefer infinity scarves and I did not realize that it was not one, quality was nice.",63381,3
63382,Arms way to small,63382,3
63383,"Lot more bigger than I thought, I'll wanted them for fashion but will see about getting them tinted for sunglasses.",63383,3
63384,The dress was dirty at the bottom like someone wore it already and just stiffed it back in the bag.,63384,3
63384,Went with the corral color instead.,63384,3
63384,"Other than that, if it looks anything like the corral dress, its gorgeous.",63384,3
63385,Way to tight had to give it away to the lady companion not cool,63385,3
63386,Good for a child 6 to 10 or so.,63386,3
63386,One hat worked perfectly and the other one worked for about 5 minutes then the lights went out.,63386,3
63386,Thought it might be the batteries so I changed them but still didn't work.,63386,3
63386,Sadly these are being returned l. My boys really loved them.,63386,3
63387,"Said they ran big,was not the case",63387,3
63388,"The waist was fine, but the legs were a little long for me.",63388,3
63388,"I still do like the overall fit, not baggy and good on the waist, just was hoping it wasn't so long.",63388,3
63389,way too big..and deffinitely not meant to be worn as a dress - beach cover up or nighgown..rather than return I will give to a friend to enjoy,63389,3
63390,Color fades quickly but cute.,63390,3
63391,Very beautiful necklace but the twisty thing on top comes loose very easily.,63391,3
63392,"I only saw the ""infants"" part of the ""infants and toddlers"" line.",63392,3
63392,Definitely not for infants.,63392,3
63392,"They appear to be good quality, a bit cheesy looking, but now I have to put them away somewhere to wait for them to fit her, I'm going to guess at least 2 years from now.",63392,3
63392,Hopefully I'll remember they exist when she can actually wear them.,63392,3
63392,"I saw someone else say they were perfect for their 9 month old walking baby-- I'd like to meet that baby, it would be quite a baby!",63392,3
63392,They are individually wrapped as well which is wasteful packaging wise.,63392,3
63393,"cute, but cheap looking",63393,3
63394,I got my dress in the mail yesterday.,63394,3
63394,And the previous viewer was right.,63394,3
63394,"It is a very pretty color, but is very short and fit me right up under my butt.",63394,3
63394,I'm going to either have to have length it.,63394,3
63394,Or wear like a shirt with some leggings and some ankle booties,63394,3
63395,"the manufacturing that went into this product looks like the seller is making about 90% of the profit ,the hinges on the sides fall off a bit easy, the plastic looks all cheap, other than that my chick looked sexy as hell in these.",63395,3
63396,This shirt arrived exactly as described however it runs much smaller than the size chart.,63396,3
63397,graet but no the size,63397,3
63398,RUNS A BIT LARGE.....,63398,3
63398,I SHOULD'VE ORDERED A SIZE SMALLER,63398,3
63399,These were somewhat bigger than expected; length and width.,63399,3
63399,They arrived much faster than expected and the quality is nice for the price.,63399,3
63400,These are really cute!,63400,3
63400,"I bought these for my 3 month old; they're a little long - as expected for him to grow into, but they're also a little tight around his thighs.",63400,3
63400,"He's only in the 30% for his weight, so his cute chubby thighs aren't really too chubby.",63400,3
63401,Bought this along with the matching 'I Know' ring.,63401,3
63401,"I haven't worn it much, mostly due to the fact that I keep forgetting to, but the other one can no longer be worn.",63401,3
63401,Within two weeks the black emblem on the inside wore off and within a month his finger started to blister around the band area.,63401,3
63401,I'm hoping to turn them both into necklaces so they still have some use.,63401,3
63402,A little too loose in the mid section but I think it would make a great maternity shirt or gym shirt.,63402,3
63404,"These tights are very run resistant, silky smooth and fit my legs very well.",63404,3
63404,"Unfortunately the green is much more vibrant in real life than in the photo, which was a disappointment as I bought them for cosplay reasons.",63404,3
63405,These look very nice and just like shown but they run pretty small by about a half size maybe even full size,63405,3
63407,Basically a black rubber band with two pieces of aluminum on either side.,63407,3
63407,Cards are tough to get out while at a register.,63407,3
63407,I thought their would be more to it then that.,63407,3
63408,The waist is somewhat loose and not as quite high as I had hoped.,63408,3
63408,It may seem loose on me because my legs are relatively big compared to my hips.,63408,3
63408,"However, they are very comfortable and I love the design/pattern options.",63408,3
63408,"They are good for casual wear, but because the waist/butt doesn't move with the body well enough, I only found them to be ""okay"" for exercises with a lot of leg movements.",63408,3
63409,The pants is good.,63409,3
63409,"I'm 5'6"" its too short for me.",63409,3
63409,The quality is not bad.,63409,3
63409,I'm 163lbs ordered 9.,63409,3
63410,Pretty but too big in the bust area,63410,3
63411,construction a bit shoddy,63411,3
63412,"This is very beautiful, but for some reason I thought the beads are bigger than that.",63412,3
63412,"Over all, I like it.",63412,3
63412,It looks good as wrap bracelet,63412,3
63415,beautiful dress but dress was not long to the floor like the picture of the model it only came a little above my ankles which made it look very tacky.,63415,3
63415,168 pounds 5'5 ordered the medium 8/10 other than the height of the dress it fit great!,63415,3
63417,"Pretty small, but most reviews say the same thing.",63417,3
63417,I usually wear a 2X and that's what size I ordered.,63417,3
63417,Its pretty tight and I don't think it will fit me after I wash it once.,63417,3
63417,"Also, is very thin.",63417,3
63418,I like the print and design.,63418,3
63418,Fits fine for me.,63418,3
63418,My only problem with this swimsuit is that the back isn't lined so when you get out of the water it becomes a little too see thru on you but.,63418,3
63419,the shirt is cute but it is WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too small.,63419,3
63419,I will give it to someone else,63419,3
63420,"Shiny, satin type of material.",63420,3
63421,"I read the reviews about this product shrinking, but what I didn't realize is that is shrinks vertically, but not around your legs or stomach.",63421,3
63421,"So the shirt is short and really wide, and the pants are short and baggy.",63421,3
63421,I would not buy this product unless you're OK with that.,63421,3
63423,Nice shoe for narrow feet.,63423,3
63424,"Small, scarf not in bow so you have to attach it somehow to bag and tie the bow.",63424,3
63425,Cute but VERY small,63425,3
63426,not a huge fan of the material but this romper is very cute and can be dressed up with a pair of heels.,63426,3
63426,I'm a 34b and 115 lbs and the small fits perfectly.,63426,3
63426,Although if you do have a big chest i don't see how you can wear this because your boobs will actually fall out of the top (there isn't much holding them in).,63426,3
63427,"After reading the reviews,  I ordered a medium rather than my usual small or xs.",63427,3
63427,It fits OK (little loose around the hips) and the small would probably have fit too.,63427,3
63427,"The straps are adjustable,  so that helped.",63427,3
63427,"I wanted this to use as a slip for a shorter dress, and it works perfectly for that.",63427,3
63427,It might be a bit short for taller women.,63427,3
63427,I purchased the white-- it is definitely see through by itself.,63427,3
63427,It is very thin material.,63427,3
63427,"For reference,  I am 5'2"" and 125 lbs,  34b.",63427,3
63429,the body suit itself is so adorable!,63429,3
63429,"the handcuffs are extremely delicate, I ripped them after the first wear.",63429,3
63430,"Not too snug, but, not as free flowing as I would like it...And wayyyy too short in the back....was hoping it would be long enough to cover my bum...but, no such luck.",63430,3
63430,"I will keep it tho, and find a use for it.",63430,3
63431,Used the size guide but it was still to big.,63431,3
63432,Not too impressed with the material and much more cheaper on ebay,63432,3
63433,Should have ordered an xlarge,63433,3
63434,I loved this dress in the picture.,63434,3
63434,One thing I didn't realize was that the rose on it is actually a pin.,63434,3
63434,It is very cheaply made.,63434,3
63434,I was not impressed with the quality.,63434,3
63435,"Was hoping for more of ""push up"" factor with this top but it's basically just a triangle top.",63435,3
63435,The halter neck straps come straight up from the top of the triangle piece so that was a bit awkward also.,63435,3
63436,Some of the sequins were falling off as she tried it on.,63436,3
63437,"I tried this shirt on once, and loved it, but I never wore it in public.",63437,3
63437,I wore a full vest over a button down shirt instead.,63437,3
63438,"Pretty cool design, but too small.",63438,3
63438,Wish there was a larger size.,63438,3
63439,Don't like how it fits,63439,3
63440,"I have a curvy body, but am relatively slim within that range.",63440,3
63440,The top is too big and the bottom is way too small.,63440,3
63440,"My measurements are 36,26,35 and this was really tight on my lower half.",63440,3
63441,Bought this because my job required me to have this color.,63441,3
63441,I usually fit a size small in urbane and other brands but this came bigger than expected.,63441,3
63443,"Top is very pretty, feminine and high enough quality material and stitching.",63443,3
63443,I bought this top to wear under my rash guard when scuba diving or snorkeling in the ocean.,63443,3
63443,For this reason the purchase is perfect.,63443,3
63443,The bottom is way too small and fits oddly and is quite frankly ridiculous.,63443,3
63443,I have already dropped it off at a thrift store.,63443,3
63443,"For the price, this is a great top.",63443,3
63445,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.,63445,3
63445,It fit as expected and did not shrink much during its one wash.,63445,3
63445,The graphic is clear and she liked it.,63445,3
63445,The issue with this shirt was really quality.,63445,3
63445,"When it arrived, I noticed the stitching on the bottom was off and there were several loose stings.",63445,3
63445,"I washed it before she wore it and the thread on the bottom of the shirt completely unraveled during its first wash leaving the bottom of the shirt undone so, it is currently unwearable.",63445,3
63445,"Either I will have to sew it or, I'll pay someone to sew it because she does generally like it.",63445,3
63445,I am however disappointed.,63445,3
63446,"I like the blouse, but it's not true to size..I was  afraid of that, so I ordered a size larger and it's still to small.",63446,3
63447,The color is perfect ... it was very nice .. however it was way too small for me... if you ordering it.. even tho you small.. get a larger size.,63447,3
63450,Arms are so made so small that I cannot get past my wrist/  I purposely bought xL to allow for shrinkage and I do not like tight fitting clothes.,63450,3
63450,"I have now learned that some of the sellers here just make their clothes this way, and I have to be more diligent when ordering.",63450,3
63450,It is very pretty otherwise.,63450,3
63450,"You need to very thin to wear it and I am more ""regular"".",63450,3
63450,"Not thin and not heavy / just regular, like most women.",63450,3
63450,"Had this experience with another online company when ordering xl jeans with holes in knees / when they arrived, I  was shocked / they would maybe fit an 8 year old.",63450,3
63450,"I am learning; as I am home bound for a few months and not used to online shopping, and do not know many of these online companies.",63450,3
63450,Sometimes you have to cut your losses.,63450,3
63450,"The clothes are made well, but for smaller people, / as thinner.",63450,3
63450,(:  Be happy.,63450,3
63451,The bottom is thong cut :/,63451,3
63452,These rings are cute and good for the price.,63452,3
63452,The size was the only issue for me.,63452,3
63452,I have small fingers and these rings fall off easily.,63452,3
63453,It was a gift...I didn't ask.,63453,3
63454,Disappointed in this purchase!,63454,3
63455,These were not my favorite.,63455,3
63455,I bought them for my 2 year old nieces and they barely fit.,63455,3
63455,Not sure they should be classified as toddler hats if they don't fit 2 year olds.,63455,3
63456,I loved the outfit but got a medium and it got like a extra large I took it in and fitted a lot better ... Other than that I loved it,63456,3
63457,very poor quality but the fit was nice it might be the material it's a little awkward,63457,3
63458,material in too thin(can see straight thru); but arrived in good time,63458,3
63459,"Cut very low in back, which I wasn't expecting.",63459,3
63460,It's a bit small but thats fine as it will motivate me to lose much need extra weight but the dress is lovely didn't expect it to be that way.,63460,3
63461,"Just started using it, I'm 12 weeks post partum  hope that it will still work for me.",63461,3
63461,All I can say is that the back support is great.,63461,3
63461,"Downside -- the width of the band is a little too big, when I tighten the band around my torso, I am unable to tighten more at my waist due to the band reaching my hips too.",63461,3
63462,"My proportions: I am 5'3"", 115 lb.",63462,3
63462,"I have an ""hour glass"" shape where the smallest part of my waist measures 25"".",63462,3
63462,"In American sizes, I ALWAYS wear a size 0 or XS.",63462,3
63462,"I looked at the Amazon size chart (according to which, I should order an XS), but after reading other customer reviews, I decided to go up a size.",63462,3
63462,I ordered a size small...but they sent me a size medium!,63462,3
63462,"I measured the waist of the medium skirt and it is 27"".",63462,3
63462,"The skirt has a high waist (over my belly button) and there is no ""give"" or elasticity in the fabric, so the size medium is actually perfect with a thick pair of leggings and sweater underneath.",63462,3
63462,"However, it really bothers me that 1) the size chart is so inaccurate (TWO sizes too small), and 2) the seller sent me a larger size than I ordered without asking me.",63462,3
63462,This sizing problem is especially troubling because the seller is located in China and returns with international shipping would be a real pain.,63462,3
63462,"Other than the sizing issue, I am happy with the skirt.",63462,3
63462,"It is 100% wool with nylon lining (and lined pockets, too!",63462,3
63462,"), so it isn't itchy.",63462,3
63462,"The sewing is high quality and the seams, zipper, pockets, belt loops, and pleats are all in the right places with good alignment and stitching.",63462,3
63462,"The style of the skirt is old fashioned and I do feel a bit frumpy in it, but I expected that--it looks EXACTLY as pictured.",63462,3
63462,"This is a well-made, warm, 100% wool, full-length skirt and you can't beat the price ($30.99).",63462,3
63462,Just beware the sizing.,63462,3
63463,"I ordered the small and it fits well, but I find it riding up throughout the day and annoying.",63463,3
63463,"Maybe a larger size would ride up less, but now I am at the point where I have given up on jeans so I see no point in ordering a new one.",63463,3
63465,cute bottoms but you can't adjust the top its way to large,63465,3
63466,"At first I loved these, 5 stars.",63466,3
63466,"They were cute, and they were reusable so I wouldn't be spending a bunch on the disposable ones.",63466,3
63466,Then it happened... our first #2.,63466,3
63466,Did they hold it in?,63466,3
63466,"Well, it held in the solid stuff...but didn't stop brown stained pool water from dripping down my toddler's legs into her water shoes.",63466,3
63466,"Then there was the task of changing her out of it - I think snaps on both sides would have made this easier because I had to try and slowly pull these off a squirmy toddler's leg and ended up with poo on my deck, her leg, and her foot.",63466,3
63466,Then there was dealing with the messy diaper which was immediately stained on the inside white part and never washed out completely despite pre-treating it.,63466,3
63466,"Now luckily I was in my own backyard when this happened and had a privacy fence so I could hose off my child, the deck, her water shoes, and then the diaper after removing the solid parts.",63466,3
63466,I could only imagine how difficult it would have been if I was at a public pool.,63466,3
63466,"I switched back to disposables because then I can just toss it in the trash and not have this big, long production because of one poop.",63466,3
63467,Not as well manufactured as I would have hoped.,63467,3
63467,The strap broke only after a few uses.,63467,3
63468,Made for tiny people.,63468,3
63468,Do not buy unless you are tiny.,63468,3
63468,"I ordered the largest size, they were laughably small.",63468,3
63469,"just doesn't lay on your ears the way you would like--also too ""young"" for me--I will save it and give as a gift.",63469,3
63470,This a pretty cool bracelet.,63470,3
63470,It was a little hard to put on at first but other than that its ok.,63470,3
63470,I gave it 3 stars because it was a little itchy after wearing it all day.,63470,3
63471,They are cute but very sharp around my nipples.,63471,3
63473,"theres a seem down the middle on the front that picture doesnt show, but its cute, shipped fast, and fits well!",63473,3
63474,I have this three stars only cuz it is comfortable and arrived before the estimated time but I ordered the emerald green and unlike the true green it shows in there picture it is more a mint shade.,63474,3
63474,List my money since this was going to be used for cosplay,63474,3
63475,Bought this for my wife and over all she is happy with the purchase.,63475,3
63475,It fit as expected.,63475,3
63475,The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the actual look of the sweater is much whiter than it appears in the picture.,63475,3
63475,It is not as gray in tone as it looks to be.,63475,3
63475,"Other than that, pretty nice.",63475,3
63476,"Cute,snug not appropriate for work.",63476,3
63477,"Got my flowertree glasses this morning in the mail and saw that they had given me two right side blinders on my pair, rather than a right and a left, so it makes the blinder bend and warp whenever i close it now.",63477,3
63477,Giving it a 3 for looks.,63477,3
63477,They seems solid otherwise.,63477,3
63477,Just using the wrong pieces in the wrong areas.,63477,3
63478,I ordered 2x for my daughter.,63478,3
63478,Which should have been to big for her.,63478,3
63478,It was to small.,63478,3
63479,Small but I can expect that in Asia sizes,63479,3
63480,"I wear a medium usually, and I bought a large because clothes from Amazon never fit...... and yes it's a bit big, which is fine I can always wear undershirts.",63480,3
63481,"It was very well made, I got it later than anticipated but just be sure to order it like a month in advance if you want the dress by a certain date.",63481,3
63481,I'm not a big sparkle person and there was quite a bit more white sparkle than anticipated.,63481,3
63481,I do wish it was more black beading or that the beading blended more like in the picture but It did fit really well.,63481,3
63481,All in all satisfied with the dress and how it was made and how it fit.,63481,3
63481,The sparkle is just a personal preference and a little out of my comfort zone.,63481,3
63482,Will have to restitch seams...,63482,3
63483,"Beautiful, but it broke almost immediately.",63483,3
63484,"It's shorter then shown and not as nice as in the pictures, very thin material, breast pads or build in bra for effect is not included, and the fluff sheds like crazy (but so did a corset for 30$ at Hot topic) not bad for he price but not good quality either.",63484,3
63485,"Based on the picture, it seemed like it would fit large and bohemian like.",63485,3
63485,It fits alright but it is not that cute look they show on the model.,63485,3
63485,I'm not a large woman either.,63485,3
63485,I recommend ordering larger than you normally would.,63485,3
63485,Really cute none the less!,63485,3
63486,"I normally love this name brand, but I was expecting true black.",63486,3
63486,These were more of a denim color.,63486,3
63487,"The material is not ""breathable"" and the size chart for this product is way off.",63487,3
63488,I'm not crazy about the zippers.,63488,3
63488,The inside one is broken.,63488,3
63489,It is as expected.,63489,3
63490,I like the jersey feel of the shirt.,63490,3
63490,I got this as a gift for my daughter--I got a small.,63490,3
63490,"It was way too big for her, or anyone who  is a small.",63490,3
63490,Don't think about getting it if you are petite.,63490,3
63490,I gave it 3 stars because I like the feel and the picture on the shirt is just as it is shown.,63490,3
63491,Missing 1 pair of earrings.,63491,3
63491,Missing  the ball  pair.,63491,3
63491,Otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating.,63491,3
63492,"Very comfortable, but look like a pair of pants that my girlfriend wears.",63492,3
63493,Very nice..but to small for the price..,63493,3
63494,"Ordered the green and the black, they are both going back.",63494,3
63494,"I am 5'0"" and 120 lbs and the small was too big.",63494,3
63494,"If you are somewhat pear shaped as I am this dress will not do your figure justice, it is cut a little too big on top.",63494,3
63494,"If you are busty this dress would be great, would provide sufficient coverage.",63494,3
63494,"The quality wasn't great, but for the price, okay.",63494,3
63494,The colors were true to description and picture online.,63494,3
63494,"The smocking was sewn with black thread even on the green and white dress which was odd, using white thread would have gone a long way in making the dress look a little classier.",63494,3
63495,Lovely and I would order more if they had an 1xl.,63495,3
63495,While the xl fits it is not as large as I would like.,63495,3
63495,Otherwise it seems to be good quality and nice colors.,63495,3
63496,"This was a nice, thick material.",63496,3
63496,"I was surprised, and delighted.",63496,3
63496,"The sleeves are a bit big for my petite frame, but they would probably fit perfectly on an average person.",63496,3
63498,Item was big on top and smaller on bottom.,63498,3
63498,The tie had many strings and a small rip.,63498,3
63499,I bought these for my 11 month old girl to ride on the plane.,63499,3
63499,I read that these would be easier than pants to change her diaper on the plane.,63499,3
63499,"But the leggings barely fit on her thighs, maybe she's just a chunky monkey.",63499,3
63499,She didn't even wear them because the plane (Jetblue) was so hot.,63499,3
63499,"Still cute, wish they were all cotton.",63499,3
63500,"They look great, but are sized pretty small.",63500,3
63500,"In fact, recipient wondered if they weren't meant for women.",63500,3
63501,"This is a cute bag, but not large enough to be a beach bag...although dimensions were listed on the description and it seemed a little too small, I took a chance because I really liked the style of it.",63501,3
63501,this would not hold a standard beach towel.,63501,3
63501,colors were not as vibrant as appeared on the website,63501,3
63502,It's cute and stylish but too big for my wrist.,63502,3
63502,"Even with the hair tie on it - it's too loose, without a hair tie it would come right off.",63502,3
63503,"I want to give this dress more stars, but it's just too thin - and I am SO sad about that!",63503,3
63503,"It's fit is flattering, and the pattern and color are just so delicate and pretty....but the material is very thin and I don't think I would wear it without a slip or something underneath that prevents it from being so see-through.",63503,3
63503,"The tie belt was a bit flimsy, too, but the dress can certainly be worn with or without it.",63503,3
63504,Feels like good quality and holds a decent amount of stuff.,63504,3
63504,"The hook is small, which limits what you can hang it on.",63504,3
63504,"The only thing I don't like is that the bag tips forward away from the wall when hanging so I feel like my taller items are going to fall out - they never have, but I would like it better if it didn't tip.",63504,3
63505,not great but not terrible,63505,3
63506,For starters these obviously aren't real oakley's.,63506,3
63506,"They look good as sunglasses, these resemble the jawbones, and are decent knockoffs, but it doesnt take an oakley expert to see they aren't the real deal upon inspecting.",63506,3
63506,"Would make great car or bike glasses, wouldnt wear these where ide actually be close to people.",63506,3
63506,"I don't have a problem wearing knockoffs, but ill be damned if I am going to flaunt a pair that is pretty easy to spot as cheap",63506,3
63507,I really liked this bracelet but it broke too soon.,63507,3
63507,I guess it was good for the price.,63507,3
63509,Material became odd after I washed it.,63509,3
63509,"Cut us nice, guys fine, suggest hand wash",63509,3
63510,I tried this exact one on at a Halloween shop and realized they ran small.,63510,3
63510,I'm a 12/14 and the medium fits me like a glove!,63510,3
63510,"I love this, however it was obvious that this costume sat smushed in a warehouse somewhere and was possibly exposed to heat.",63510,3
63510,The skirt part of the costume got miscolored as a result.,63510,3
63510,Hopefully the wrinkles will come out if I hang it.,63510,3
63510,"But for a $30 costume, I didn't have high expectations.",63510,3

Dress is quite pretty, but fabric not quite suitable for a larger person such as myself - a little too clingy.",63511,3
63511,The color is beautiful - a rich teal.,63511,3
63511,Size is a little bigger than expected - will have to make some adjustments in the under-arm area.,63511,3
63511,But that could be my body shape rather than the dress.,63511,3
63511,I am 5ft 2ins and the dress does not touch the floor even without shoes!,63511,3
63512,"They look cool but they are way to small, like the comments before probably better for middle school age kids",63512,3
63513,"This dress is cute, yes but I wouldn't say high quality and it was misleading because the straps on mine are NOT adjustable as shown.",63513,3
63513,I will have to sew mine to fit right!,63513,3
63513,"In all honesty I also thought it was a swimsuit because all suits I looked at said ""swim dress"", therefore I thought I was getting a type of swimsuit that you don't see very often but  it has no bottom so definitely more of a bathing suit cover up.",63513,3
63513,Maybe my mistake but a little misleading.,63513,3
63513,"All in all, not bad for the price but more than I would have paid for a cover up had I known.",63513,3
63514,"Ordered a small and it was still big on me, still very cute though.",63514,3
63515,Not quite the best quality but it cute,63515,3
63516,Thin material and was larger then expected.,63516,3
63518,I really loves the texture but the hoodie and the pockets seem odd sized in comparison to everything else...,63518,3
63520,"Just don't know what's the front or back, but its a comfy shirt",63520,3
63522,"Very soft warm leggings,however they fit on the small side.",63522,3
63523,"It was a cute top, but the fitting was awkward.",63523,3
63524,Not a heavy necklace.,63524,3
63524,Clasp a little hard to open.,63524,3
63524,Very elegant necklace for an affordable price.,63524,3
63525,To small won't fit on me even I order extra large.,63525,3
63526,This shirt is ok but doesn't look as nice as it does in the pictures.,63526,3
63526,Looks more like a maternity shirt.,63526,3
63527,"Pretty hoodie, but not sized right.",63527,3
63527,Gave it to my sister who is a medium.,63527,3
63528,The bust size was a tight fit.,63528,3
63528,I loved the fabric and the fit except of course I wish the shoulder and bust size would be bigger.,63528,3
63529,It was came super fast!,63529,3
63529,The dress fits nicely but white is nearly see through.,63529,3
63530,Ehhh small and not flattering but cheap.,63530,3
63530,For smaller skinner under 130 would look nice.,63530,3
63530,On me wasn't flattering,63530,3
63531,The dress is ok.,63531,3
63531,It will serve it's purpose.,63531,3
63532,"The colors were different than the picture by a lot, but it was still an attractive bathing suit.",63532,3
63532,Until I put it on.,63532,3
63532,Don't think that just because it is from China that you have to go up a size!,63532,3
63532,"I usually wear a medium (I'm 5'8"" and 135 lbs) and I made the mistake of purchasing a large.",63532,3
63532,"I did return this product because the large was so big, it was unwearable.",63532,3
63532,"I would have ordered it again in medium, but unfortunately the design on the front of the bottoms made my crotch look a little funny.",63532,3
63532,"I was going for a different looking, colourful bathing suit and that's definitely what it is!",63532,3
63534,Wasn't the same color.,63534,3
63534,It was a dark brown Also wasn't connected,63534,3
63535,"Very thin, cheaply made.",63535,3
63535,I bought it as a dress but will only let my daughter sleep in it.,63535,3
63536,"Nice fit, looks precisely as pictured",63536,3
63537,The fabric is see through - you can completely see the pads through the fabric.,63537,3
63537,"Otherwise, the product is nice/",63537,3
63538,You get what you paid for.. Its def.,63538,3
63539,They are way bigger than I expected.,63539,3
63539,I hope they shrink.,63539,3
63541,"Posts are not very long, and the stoppers are minuscule.",63541,3
63541,They are way smaller than we are used to.,63541,3
63541,I'm  afraid my friend who is in her 60s wouldn't be able to get them on.,63541,3
63542,His dress is very nice and good quality material and I liked the cut.,63542,3
63542,Unfortunately it's not really made for curvy girls:).,63542,3
63542,"I'm 5'6, 127lbs, size 6 or medium, D cup.",63542,3
63542,Based on other reviews I ordered an xl and was too tight on my bottom.,63542,3
63542,Returned for a xxl and was perfect on my rear but too big on top.,63542,3
63543,"This is a very pretty dress, the material is decent (silk on the bottom half, transparent lace on top).",63543,3
63543,It did have an odd smell to it when I received it but It wasn't 'awful'.,63543,3
63543,"I put the dress on with heels, went to walk around the house and quickly learned that the dress does not stay down in place (especially in the front where the two materials meet).",63543,3
63543,"The ""v"" it makes in the front, eventually goes high enough to reveal your ""v"", which is why I returned this dress.",63543,3
63543,"If they could get it to stay down in place, I would love to re-order this dress.",63543,3
63544,"I love this jewelry set and it is priced so well but unfortunately my elephant ring broke within a few days of wearing it :-(, otherwise I would give it five stars.",63544,3
63544,I still wear the others and for the price I didn't expect super high quality.,63544,3
63546,"Too sheer, needed to get something to put underneath",63546,3
63547,Washed it and it shrunk,63547,3
63548,The stomach part is good but it makes your butt look rediculous and obvious.,63548,3
63548,I bought a different one.,63548,3
63549,Super cute but it tends to tangle while wearing it.,63549,3
63550,this hat is even uglier in person.,63550,3
63550,"it works for what i bought it for, which was to cut slits in the side so i could fit my ear protectors though it so i can wear a hat and ear muffs at the same time, but the brim is really curvy and the neck flap is too narrow and doesn't cover as well as i'd like.",63550,3
63550,"but hey, its a cheap hat and does the job.",63550,3
63551,The scarf ring is lovely and looks really good on scarves.,63551,3
63551,"However, there was a sharp spot inside that would snag a scarf.",63551,3
63551,I sandpapered it down and put clear nail polish over it.,63551,3
63551,It is now smooth and safe for my silk scarves.,63551,3
63551,There needs to be better quality control.,63551,3
63552,But the backs slip off to easy.,63552,3
63553,This dress is HUGE!!!,63553,3
63553,My daughter will be wearing a 2T before she can wear this dress.,63553,3
63553,It also stunk really really bad.,63553,3
63553,You get what you pay for I guess.. should have went to Osh Kosh,63553,3
63554,I didn't like this because it not latex it's vinyl,63554,3
63555,"Cup size  good, but tight around the chest.",63555,3
63556,There was one back string straight up not attached to the side.,63556,3
63556,Luckily I have a sewing machine but disappointed.,63556,3
63556,Other than that once I fixed the product it is good.,63556,3
63557,The are hard to get on and around your ear.,63557,3
63557,I had to use needle nose plyers to open them up and then try to fit the ball back and squeeze/bend it shut.,63557,3
63557,It took about an hour.,63557,3
63558,It's pretty difficult to buy a hat online.,63558,3
63558,Size was small the bend in the brim is excessive and depth is shallow.,63558,3
63558,Sharp hat but just doesn't look right wearing it.,63558,3
63559,"The dress is beautiful, but the sequins are very rough and instantly gave me an awful rash",63559,3
63561,"Too small, I wear sizes 8-10, 150lbs, 5'7 and XXL was perfect for me.",63561,3
63561,I got the large first and ended up giving to someone who wears a small.,63561,3
63563,The dress fit well and is really pretty but so short!,63563,3
63563,I'm 5'1 and it barely covers my butt.,63563,3
63563,If you're tall or above 5'1 I wouldn't recommend this dress.,63563,3
63564,"I ordered the dress a size larger than I ordinarily wear, and it was still too snug, especially the sleeves.",63564,3
63564,"I was only wearing it for one day as part of a 60s costume, so it wasn't a big deal, but use caution if this will be part of your regular wardrobe.",63564,3
63565,I ordered this with the imression it was PINK and black when I clicked black.,63565,3
63565,Not sliver and black.,63565,3
63565,If it wasn't SUPER important is send it back.,63565,3
63566,"its alright, kinda looks cheap but you get what you pay for.",63566,3
63567,The blouse is pretty.,63567,3
63568,There were rips in the toes area and threads hanging everywhere.,63568,3
63568,"If it wasn't such a hassle and if my 5 year old would let me return it, I would have.",63568,3
63568,"Instead, I had to finish sewing it  and cut off all the hanging threads",63568,3
63569,A little disappointed the front of the shirt is precious!,63569,3
63569,The back of it is a mess!,63569,3
63569,The patterns do not match up...,63569,3
63570,"The shirt looks good, and i bought a little bigger size because i wasn't sure how it will fit.",63570,3
63570,However the sleeves are way too large on the forearm area than they are supposed to be.,63570,3
63570,"When you design a blouse to have those kind of sleeve clips on the side, then the sleeve shape should be more on the body rather than expanding towards the wrist.",63570,3
63570,It just doesn't look right.,63570,3
63570,And it has nothing to do with the size but with the design.,63570,3
63571,I had my ears at 1/2inch at one point and i let them shrink.,63571,3
63571,"So this product is doing its job to get back up to 1/2"" but they are definitely cheap and wouldn't want to wear them around long than needed.",63571,3
63572,The bottoms are great.,63572,3
63572,"The top, however, became malformed upon its second washing and is now not even usable.",63572,3
63572,"It folds outward along the edge, rather than staying close to my skin and providing the needed coverage.",63572,3
63572,I have to now buy another top to go with these bottoms.,63572,3
63572,"For the $13.99 that I paid, I supposed that's not too bad.",63572,3
63573,Definitely not the burgundy-red as pictured.,63573,3
63573,"I've looked at this on two different computers and my smartphone, and all screens showed the burgundy-color, NOT the bright tomato red that this dress is (maybe you're looking for that color though); I'm curious to see what kind of blue the blue is, but not curious enough to give it a try (I assume the black would actually be black).",63573,3
63573,"The material is nice and soft, HOWEVER the dress arrived so wrinkled, it was hard to imagine what it would look like without wrinkles.",63573,3
63573,"I hung it in my closet for about two weeks to see if the wrinkles would relax; they did somewhat, but still not enough to give me confidence that this dress would be easy to take care of and keep it nice looking.",63573,3
63573,"Additionally, the dress has these prominent lines down the front (you can't see them very well on the product's page); I think they're suppose to make you look skinnier (like the color-blocking trend), but I think they just look awkward (it looks like there are pockets, but alas, there aren't).",63573,3
63573,I think this dress looks too casual for work or cocktails or a wedding; I really don't know what I'd wear it to.,63573,3
63574,"i bought this for my wife; she liked it, but i m not good at buying her clothes.",63574,3
63574,"she says its to thin, needs a slip.",63574,3
63575,Theres no question this is well made and solid.,63575,3
63575,Its exactly what you would want in your shirt pocket to stop a stray bullet.,63575,3
63575,"But as a wallet, it has a couple of deficiencies.",63575,3
63575,The wallet can accommodate a few US bills provided they are folded three ways.,63575,3
63575,Keep in mind that you will probably want to avoid the express lane because all that folding an unfolding takes time.,63575,3
63575,"Alternatively, you may want to just discard small denominations since wallet space is so limited.",63575,3
63575,The wallet can easily accommodate a few business cards provided you trim them 1/4 inch on each side.,63575,3
63575,Otherwise you will have to jam them into one of the pockets.,63575,3
63575,Did I mention how handsome the wallet looks?,63575,3
63575,"Every time you slip it out of your sports coat, its a reminder that you are a man of means and discrimination  even if its not very functional.",63575,3
63576,This is a great product for the price and shipping was impeccable.,63576,3
63576,"However, I ordered a 3x to fit loosely but my daughter whom wears a small couldn't wear it.",63576,3
63576,The sizing isn't accurate at all.,63576,3
63577,Xtra jumbo needed for neverful medium size,63577,3
63578,"This dress was adorable, however the sequin heart came un stitched on the first day that my Daughter wore it.",63578,3
63579,Nice but the size is small,63579,3
63580,The tshirt we got was defective.,63580,3
63580,"My son still wears it, but it is not a good quality.",63580,3
63580,"Also, runs a bit llarge.",63580,3
63581,But it is a bit small around the abdomen area.,63581,3
63581,So it gives u a wedgey lol,63581,3
63582,Its a pretty small shoulder bag......,63582,3
63583,I just had a c section three weeks ago.,63583,3
63583,I did a ton of research and it was between the c panty and the bellefit corset.,63583,3
63583,Ultimately I chose the c panty bc it was cheaper.,63583,3
63583,I first ordered the 1x size bc based on other people's reviews sized myself based on measurements and not dress size.,63583,3
63583,Pre-pregnancy I was a size 14 - 202 lbs and now postpartum 3 weeks I weigh 205 lbs.,63583,3
63583,When I received it and tried it on it was definitely too big - I felt like it was no different than a good pair of my Soma undies.,63583,3
63583,So I thought I got the wrong size and then ordered a L/XL.,63583,3
63583,"When I received it and tried it on it fit better but I still didn't feel like it had ""medical grade compression.""",63583,3
63583,I felt like it better no better or worse than a good pair of spanx.,63583,3
63583,So I returned both sizes and then purchased the bellefit dual closure corset from the bellefit website.,63583,3
63583,"I'm sure the c panty works for some people, maybe it depends on body shape and how much of a ""shelf"" you need to hold in on your lower abdomen.",63583,3
63583,"For me it didn't work, but it looked it was made of good quality and durability.",63583,3
63583,"I don't know that it could be considered ""medical grade compression"" bc it seemed the same strength as a pair of spanx.",63583,3
63583,But ultimately if you're on the fence I would still suggest you order this first bc it's cheaper than the bellefit and Amazon prime gets free returns so you don't have anything to lose.,63583,3
63583,The height of the panty (how far up it went on me) was just right.,63583,3
63583,"I am 5'1"" hourglass - I don't have an especially long torso, I would say I'm probably average for my height and the panty went right up to my bra line so I was able to just barely tuck it under my bra line which was perfect for me.",63583,3
63583,It was very comfortable around my legs.,63583,3
63583,I would say in the smaller size there was a little bulging at the thighs but not too bad.,63583,3
63584,Comfy material but run very small,63584,3
63585,This is a good pack for the money the mouth piece leaks and you can't remove the bladder but a bad pack for the money.,63585,3
63586,The mid section is a little tight.,63586,3
63586,Maybe it may be better once I get into the water.,63586,3
63587,Was a present for my sister for Christmas.,63587,3
63587,"Probably not quite as ""heavy"" as I would expect from a sweatshirt.",63587,3
63588,This suit runs slightly smaller than expected.,63588,3
63590,"Used it on loafers that were a tad too big on my right foot, I have uneven feet one is slightly smaller than the other :( This item did the job, but some of the tongue pads were dirty...The ones that are clean and I can use are ok so far.",63590,3
63591,The quality is not that great which is what I was afraid of.,63591,3
63591,It's not too bad but not the best.,63591,3
63591,I'm pear shaped so the top was too big and the bottoms were a little too smal,63591,3
63592,The whole brief is great but way to tight in the area where it wraps around the leg.,63592,3
63593,The owl part broke the second day of wearing and the angel wings went soon after.,63593,3
63594,Nice lightweight cotton material but it's way too small.,63594,3
63594,Buy AT LEAST two sizes up,63594,3
63595,This is a really super cute jumper but the material is not breathable at all.,63595,3
63595,"It doesn't have any stretch to it either, which makes it a little difficult to get on.",63595,3
63595,"The shorts are quite a bit short but if you don't bend over or lift your hands, not so bad.",63595,3
63595,:) once on and just standing in a cooler room it's great.,63595,3
63596,"The material was very soft and looked great, but the size is more child sizes.....I wear a 12 and could not get it on.",63596,3
63596,Ordered 4 for a party and had to return them all.,63596,3
63597,Nice colors and material just ran small,63597,3
63598,I've only worn them once and 15 minutes later there were runs in the fabric.,63598,3
63598,"They have a good fi, but the fabric isn't too good.",63598,3
63599,Its ok but very thin material and cheaply made.,63599,3
63600,Needles are good pierced through dcar tissue with no issues.,63600,3
63600,The clamps are are a little lame and mine didn't come with cbr pliers.,63600,3
63600,The jewelry that cam with was not the appropriate size for nipples.,63600,3
63600,Not wide enough openings unfortunately.,63600,3
63600,It leaves no room for swelling or comfortable cleaning.,63600,3
63600,However for anything else I imagine the jewelry would be adequate.,63600,3
63600,I put some in existing piercings with no issue.,63600,3
63601,Five starts for cuteness!,63601,3
63601,"However, very stiff shoe.",63601,3
63601,No flexibility in the sole.,63601,3
63601,Also very hard to slip and off for my six year old.,63601,3
63601,She never wears these because they are just to hard to get on.,63601,3
63601,Very cute but I won't buy slip on vans again.,63601,3
63602,My daughter will love it!,63602,3
63603,The front of this backpack is like a weird soft felt material,63603,3
63604,looks okay.. but does not provide any warmth as the material is not thick enough,63604,3
63605,"It stays on most of the time, and when it came off a few times it floats and I was able to retrieve it.",63605,3
63605,"What I dislike the most is the amount of material on the straps covering the ear, which muffles sound and makes it difficult to hear, so I'm always twisting and rotating it on my head and tucking the straps behind and in front of my ears.",63605,3
63605,The brim comes down low over the eyes and I'm always pushing it up out of the way.,63605,3
63606,I got this a couple of sizes bigger because I wanted it to look oversized.,63606,3
63606,The width was fine but this is really more of a crop top... it just barely goes over the button of my jeans.,63606,3
63607,The price and amount of shirts you get with this are great - but as someone who usually wears small - I ordered medium just in case and these are like belly button shirts on me - unlike in the pic.,63607,3
63607,They are ok quality but seem to be a bit small size wise.,63607,3
63608,It fits well but the color was a little off...a lighter shade of green,63608,3
63609,"I normally wear a size X-L, so from the reviews about this shirt being a bit small, I decided to order XX-L.",63609,3
63609,Even that is a tad small.,63609,3
63609,"Shame, because I really like it.",63609,3
63609,"Other than the fact it has awesome graphics, the quality is really good.",63609,3
63609,I gave it only three stars because of the sizing.,63609,3
63609,"I wish they had it in XXX-L.

Edit: Since last posting this review, I have been in contact with the seller.",63609,3
63609,They have been really nice about this whole issue regarding sizing.,63609,3
63609,"It's definitely not their fault, it's just boils down to the fact that it is Asian sizing.",63609,3
63609,"I had approached them thinking that perhaps my shirt was labeled/marked wrong, but it isn't.",63609,3
63609,"They were kind enough to offer a refund, but I decided to keep the jersey as a Tour de France collectable.",63609,3
63609,"Also, it is helping to motivate me in losing weight considering how tight it fit.",63609,3
63609,"Yep, I have to get rid of that small basketball in my stomach.",63609,3
63609,":-)

A further edit: The seller, Avengers Outdoors, has been so very gracious in dealing with me.",63609,3
63609,"Every time I contact them, they respond right away.",63609,3
63609,"As much as they couldn't find a shirt that would fit me, they refunded my money and told me to keep the shirt.",63609,3
63609,How nice it would be if all companies treated their customers with the kindness and respect that Avengers Outdoors showed me.,63609,3
63609,"Bare in mind again, that the three star rating is only due to the sizing issue, and not the seller.",63609,3
63609,"I give full marks to the seller, and look forward to dealing with them again if a product I need in the future is one that they sell.",63609,3
63610,This is the 2nd time this has happened to me  when I ordered a shirt and the company uses European measurements and they don't even come close to the size that they're are advertising the clothing is!,63610,3
63610,I ordered a 2x and received a shirt that fits my daughter like a shirt that is maybe 2 sizes too large and she  wears a size 0 in Jr's!,63610,3
63610,So be careful if you need to order a larger size because it'll probably be too small!,63610,3
63611,It's okay but rings should be larger these were more for young teen girls or even younger not mature full grown women.,63611,3
63612,"Nice size, but quality is flimsy to say the least!",63612,3
63613,"Was way too small, would not even fit my daughter who is tiny.",63613,3
63613,Will not use this company again,63613,3
63614,"The dress is pretty, but its was supposed to be ankle length, but it it's me about mid calf, I am not a tall woman, I am 5'6"" 1/2, also the material is very stiff.",63614,3
63614,"I haven't washed it yet to see if it softens, as it aggravated me, so I just put it away.",63614,3
63614,I was assuming that it would be a super soft material.,63614,3
63614,"I wouldn't buy this again, but I also will not return it.",63614,3
63614,It will work for a costum,63614,3
63615,Wanted this to keep the sun out of my eyes.,63615,3
63615,"Looks like image, except, I wanted cotton, as they had listed at the time I ordered it.",63615,3
63615,"When it arrived, I saw that the material is like a windbreaker.",63615,3
63615,The tag says 100% Polyester.,63615,3
63615,I think it was an honest mistake on their part.,63615,3
63615,I like the versatile colors.,63615,3
63615,Stitching looks good too.,63615,3
63615,"I'm just concerned I'll sweat too much in this, and it looks a bit thin.",63615,3
63615,"If it had been 100% cotton, it would have been fine, except the ventilation holes aren't lined up inside, and out.",63615,3
63615,"Seller very cordial, answered inquiries promptly, and willing to work with me to find a compromise.",63615,3
63615,They changed error on product description page within a couple of days.,63615,3
63616,Not tight enough to hold my stomach,63616,3
63617,Way too small in the legs...even for a size 8,63617,3
63618,"Seems to be made cheap, it's pretty thin and it was kind of small.",63618,3
63620,was different thing photo and delliveried goods.,63620,3
63622,"It's very comfy because it has a lot of stretch to it, but it's also very thin.",63622,3
63622,"I got a 6 and need to go a size down because the shoulders are too broad, but with such thin fabric on a fitted style I won't bother.",63622,3
63624,"Took forever to arrive, and the floral layer had little snags in it.",63624,3
63624,I kept it I didn't really want to go througj trying to return it.,63624,3
63625,The bottom part of the bathing suit does not fit the behind.,63625,3
63625,It's too large and saggy.,63625,3
63626,"it's doesn't flow, it's kind of a stiff material.it fit wide on me yet at the perfect length.",63626,3
63626,"i just use it as pjs, which is perfect as a pj.",63626,3
63626,The blue color looks washed out after two washes.,63626,3
63626,it had a really bad smell when i first opened it.,63626,3
63627,They looked fun but were too small and I had to return them.,63627,3
63628,The fabric was very thin and won't hold up.,63628,3
63629,It is rather small and the fabric is low quality.,63629,3
63630,good quality for the price.,63630,3
63631,Had to return because it was too small for my son.,63631,3
63631,The shipping to return was about $9.,63631,3
63631,"I was unhappy about that, but he wanted the design so I ordered another.",63631,3
63632,"The fabric is not as pictured(heathered and cottony) but rather a solid color, very sheer form fitting spandex mix.",63632,3
63632,I bought this hoping it would hide the extra bit of weight I gained over winter.....but no....this thing telegraphs and accentuates every flaw you have...I did not even realize there was cellulite on my upper arms until I put this thing on.,63632,3
63632,"Shipped fast, Size was perfect, it is very comfortable and if you have a perfect figure you may love it.",63632,3
63632,"Otherwise, don't waste your time and money.",63632,3
63633,"It fits as expected...Carter's products always do, but I didn't receive this outfit, I received something similar in a completely different color.",63633,3
63634,I bought this hoping to surprise my fiance for Christmas.,63634,3
63634,"He's a big anime nerd, so I figured this would be perfect for surprising him.",63634,3
63634,"I read the reviews, and saw many saying the skirt runs small.",63634,3
63634,"Now, I'm a large normally.",63634,3
63634,"So, I figured ordering a 3X would be safe.",63634,3
63634,That skirt is not no 3x.,63634,3
63634,It's not even a large.,63634,3
63634,The skirt I was sent looks more like a small.,63634,3
63634,"It would have fit me prepregnancy just perfectly, which was about twenty pounds ago.",63634,3
63634,I could not get it around my waist.,63634,3
63634,"I have to pull it to my belly button for it to fit, and then it doesn't cover my butt.",63634,3
63634,"I guess that's perfect for bedroom wear, but definitely could not use it outside the bedroom.",63634,3
63634,"Even so, I was disappointed.",63634,3
63634,"The shirt fit perfectly, so I was confused why there was such a size difference there.",63634,3
63634,It's like it was made for someone who's 120 lbs with DD breasts...,63634,3
63634,"The socks were a perfect fit, too.",63634,3
63634,I'll probably end up just buying a different skirt to pair with it.,63634,3
63634,A black one would match the socks.,63634,3
63634,"Be warned: If you have wide hips like I do, the skirt probably will not fit you.",63634,3
63634,This outfit is made for people who aren't built like Jessica Rabbit.,63634,3
63634,Don't feel bad if you order a really big size and it doesn't fit.,63634,3
63634,The sizing on this one is WAY off.,63634,3
63634,"According to the chart, the size I ordered should have fit.",63634,3
63635,Beautiful but runs very small.,63635,3
63635,I'm normally a size medium and ordered an XL and it was still small.,63635,3
63636,They were  OK and did the job as required,63636,3
63637,the golden buttons and blue ones weren't there lol,63637,3
63638,Fits small and shrinks even smaller.,63638,3
63639,It is very VERY GREEN not the blue-green I was expecting,63639,3
63640,The size difference between these and regular crocs was huge for my son.,63640,3
63640,I bought them in the second size yet these he is going to ha e to grow into.,63640,3
63641,"Love this type of hat, great for bad hair days.",63641,3
63641,The green color was somewhat strange.,63641,3
63641,"Not a  celery, lime, hunter....",63641,3
63642,Not as long as it looks.,63642,3
63642,"My daughter is 5-4, so it's not that she is too tall.",63642,3
63643,"It's a nice blouse but a little tigher than expected and the material is heaver than I expected, I like light weight blouse.",63643,3
63644,It would be cute if it fit.,63644,3
63644,I went up in size as others have mentioned.,63644,3
63644,It will be cute in the donation bin.,63644,3
63644,The cost to return it isn't worth it to me.,63644,3
63645,"Just a little small looks a lot bigger in the picture, wish I knew ahead of time or saw pictures with people wearing them I would have bought a bigger size",63645,3
63646,Cute button detail...too bad the buttons came off the first time I tried it on.,63646,3
63646,"Still works, little small even though I used the company's sizing specs.",63646,3
63646,No underwire as was in product detail.,63646,3
63646,I wouldn't recommend for anyone busty.,63646,3
63646,"Beautiful detail, could be better.",63646,3
63647,It was a cute shirt when worn the first time.,63647,3
63647,The screen print on the front started cracking after going through the wash.,63647,3
63648,I received it on time.,63648,3
63648,Beautiful and elegant piece.,63648,3
63648,"However, it has some minor scratches on each pearl.",63648,3
63648,I retuned and repurchased a new one.,63648,3
63648,Hopefully this one is a magic one for the price.,63648,3
63649,"Pattern looked totally different than picture so that made it look funny when wearing, didn't look like picture but fit.",63649,3
63650,"It's a beautiful dress, but I got a Medium following their size chart, and it's still 2 sizes too small for me.",63650,3
63650,I'll just have to gift this to someone a whole lot skinnier.,63650,3
63651,Really cute bathing suit I am 5'3 159lbs  I normally wear size large clothes but after reading reviews about it being small decided to order an x large...,63651,3
63651,The top was too big on me 36B/C but bottoms still seemed small even after going up one size (butt area looked too stretched out) sadly will have to return this,63651,3
63652,The color is beatiful but the size no,63652,3
63654,Very pretty swim suite,63654,3
63655,I suppose I might be a hard fit...it fits fine on my back side but too big on my legs.,63655,3
63655,I just cannot find a pair of Jeans that fits ALL of me properly and I've wasted so much money and so much time and frustration sending things back... it's exhausting.,63655,3
63655,This is one good reason I HATE shopping.,63655,3
63657,"it's not what the picture show's, but it on a little small for my wrist.",63657,3
63658,I love the color and print!,63658,3
63658,I was so excited about this scarf.,63658,3
63658,The only problem is that it has a weird smell to it that I can't get rid of so I don't wear it often.,63658,3
63659,Thin material but cute.,63659,3
63660,Too large for my nose,63660,3
63661,Cute purse but poorly stitched.,63661,3
63661,Button that holds it closed ended up coming off after a month of daily use.,63661,3
63662,These are super cute and my daughter really likes them.,63662,3
63662,Only downfall is the strap ripped off the shoe after her only wearing them 2 weeks.,63662,3
63663,Price was right but it just doesn't seem to fit the foot well.,63663,3
63664,It's much prettier online than in person.,63664,3
63665,Its for use at house in cofort.,63665,3
63665,But its too big for me.,63665,3
63665,I will send to fix and its ok.,63665,3
63666,Not all that impressed with this product.,63666,3
63666,The quality of the ring itself is very good.,63666,3
63666,It's a heavy ring.,63666,3
63666,I have issue with the size stones as they have absolutely no shine at all.,63666,3
63666,They are pretty much opaque white.,63666,3
63666,The center stone while clear and sparkly looks like glass.,63666,3
63666,There's no fire in the stone as they usually is with a higher quality CZ.,63666,3
63667,The plugs I received were 7/16ths.,63667,3
63667,"Fortunately my wife is currently in this size, so we could use them, but I had to buy more from another seller.",63667,3
63667,"As far as the products themselves, they are great.",63667,3
63667,"Smooth threads, no sharp edges.",63667,3
63668,Small and fabric of bottoms both tears and stretched in under a month very cute tho.,63668,3
63668,Just not the best quality  and I bought two of these so it wasn't just a fluke one time error,63668,3
63670,"Arrived late, and fit much smaller then the size it was supposed to be.",63670,3
63670,However it is beautiful and I love it.,63670,3
63671,"This pants does not stay in one place, it keeps running does my waist.",63671,3
63672,Not as shiny as the pic!,63672,3
63672,Everything else is ok but looks a little cheap,63672,3
63673,"Very thin material, definitely needs a liner of some type in order to be decent.",63673,3
63676,The necklace is nicely made for the low cost.,63676,3
63677,I loved the style of this bathing suit but unfortunately it made me look like a box.,63677,3
63677,I'm still getting rid of baby weight around my belly and it was not flattering for me at all.,63677,3
63677,I would of definitely kept it if o had my shape back.,63677,3
63678,It is light and seems OK quality.,63678,3
63678,It is a little smaller than other 20 inch spinners and most importantly it is NOT expandable despite its description claims so.,63678,3
63678,"Also, the inside compartments have less/zippers have lesser bells and whistles than some others I have seen.",63678,3
63679,Looks better on the model than on me.,63679,3
63680,"I loved what the t-shirt said because my daughter's All-Star softball team's name was Stars & Strikes.....however, the writing and flag on the t-shirt started to come off after it was washed a couple of times and the colors ran together.",63680,3
63681,I am pleased with the hand bag.,63681,3
63681,It is light weight and easily holds the things I find necessary to carry.,63681,3
63682,Pleased with my purchase.,63682,3
63683,The color is way off and it looks cheaply made.,63683,3
63684,It was a bit large.. Quality wise it is very nice..,63684,3
63685,My daughter loved these bracelets but they broke after a short time.,63685,3
63686,This is really cute and super comfortable.,63686,3
63686,"However, it seems to be in the state of wrinkle!",63686,3
63686,You have to be really careful fire exactly the right time and to hang it up because if you don't it just looks like a hot mess.,63686,3
63686,** update...this is highly wrinkleable.,63686,3
63686,"Even if you grab it out of the dryer the second it stops running, you may need to iron it.",63686,3
63686,Ive given up on wearing it to work.,63686,3
63687,"to big, need smaller size",63687,3
63688,Thought we were getting three different pairs of one direction socks and got three of the same.,63688,3
63690,Fit runs a little small,63690,3
63691,"They are supposed to be rattles but they make no noise at all, just a distraction I guess.",63691,3
63692,I'm not plus sized but I wanted a longer skirt than the regular women's size.,63692,3
63692,I'm generally a size 12 so not so small but this dress is huge.,63692,3
63692,I had to pin in about 8 inches and belt it for it to not look like a velvet sack.,63692,3
63692,"Even though the dress was big, the tights were small.",63692,3
63692,Had to throw spanx over them to keep them up and they ran almost immediately.,63692,3
63692,The mask was barely worn but the velvet peeled off already too.,63692,3
63692,Next time I'll just get black paint for my eyes.,63692,3
63692,Can be made in to a cute costume for sure but could be much better quality from the get-go.,63692,3
63693,A little snug than expected!,63693,3
63694,A little bigger than expected.,63694,3
63695,The shipping cost was more than cost the item!,63695,3
63695,So I just kept the items.,63695,3
63696,not to bad but is too short,63696,3
63697,"Very delicate but beautiful, Breaks easily.",63697,3
63698,Very stiff material which made the 2 smaller pockets hard to get into.,63698,3
63698,I only gave it 3 stars because you get what you pay for and my expectations were pretty low.,63698,3
63699,Extremely to small but definitely an hour glass shape.,63699,3
63699,Not for thick girls!!,63699,3
63700,"Unfortunately I already had to glue the seams around the ""V"" cut in both the front and back.",63700,3
63700,Otherwise I like the blouse.,63700,3
63701,"A little short, very thin.",63701,3
63702,I haven't tried this on yet- the material is pretty flimsy and its light polyester/spandexy..,63702,3
63702,Doesn't look too tight though which is good!!,63702,3
63702,It's pretty cute just not the best quality!,63702,3
63704,The description said for shoe size 13-15 but the product was only for up to shoe size 13.,63704,3
63705,Bought a L. Fits like a M. But everything with this brand runs small,63705,3
63706,The clip doesn't hold well,63706,3
63707,"A very casual shirt, cute but a little on the small side.",63707,3
63708,It's a bit too long but will get it halter,63708,3
63709,The design is attractive but the fabric is very thin.,63709,3
63709,Maybe good to wear on a very hot day.,63709,3
63709,It would be nice if they made the same design in a better quality fabric - even if it costs more.,63709,3
63710,We did the online test first and it said we had a 75% chance of having a positive experience.,63710,3
63710,"My son (age 8) says some colors look brighter, but it wasn't a dramatic change like some people I have seen on the videos.",63710,3
63710,He has a pretty significant color problem with red/green.,63710,3
63710,"So these glasses didn't help as much as I had hoped, but he still likes to wear them to see the slight color variation.",63710,3
63710,They seem to work better outside in bright light.,63710,3
63710,"Also wish they came in a child size - we purchased the adult size since we were so desperate to try them out, but they are a little loose.",63710,3
63711,Little shorter than I expected.,63711,3
63713,This costume is decent but it is much bigger than it states on the size chart.,63713,3
63714,The out fit was to small.,63714,3
63714,I pick a 2X but it was still to smal I bought it to wear at my birthaday party but I had to wear something else.,63714,3
63715,"It's not a bad skirt it's just not versital, it's tight and a good material, but it looks odd with any shirt that isn't a crop top",63715,3
63716,"very thin material, very small, had to return even though I sized up due to being too short",63716,3
63717,One of the pijamas came with holes.. like the sawing machine never pass through there.,63717,3
63718,Stitching of seems is not very good quality but the dress is very cute.,63718,3
63721,"It is okay, the top will do.",63721,3
63722,It's nice but runs small.,63722,3
63722,Made in China so definitely get one size bigger from your normal size.,63722,3
63722,It washes well and the style wears nice.,63722,3
63723,Runs like a junior size leggings!,63723,3
63724,"Top has no support/the bra closes with a slid ""clip"" so comes undone super easy.",63724,3
63724,Skirt was very long/too big so it would slide down.,63724,3
63724,Had a real clip added to close bra and had the sides of skirt taken in and skirt shortened so it stays on now.,63724,3
63724,Top meant more for A-B cup I'm a C but back clip seriously would need to be reinforced for anyone.,63724,3
63724,Surprised I had to alter skirt I'm a size 8-10 and skirt was still too big for even me.,63724,3
63724,"Having said all this for price it's a great item, just get before time you need it fe alterations.",63724,3
63725,Very thin material and a little small.,63725,3
63726,"Nice collection, the cufflinks and button covers are the best part, and the tie and cumberbund are fine.",63726,3
63726,The shirt had a lot of stray threads that I had to carefully trim off to make it presentable.,63726,3
63727,If I am sure I can get something better I will return it.,63727,3
63728,Too small for my husband's  size 10 1/2 feet.,63728,3
63729,I love it but it's didn't close the zipper right,63729,3
63730,This was too small and I returned it.,63730,3
63730,I wear a 16 and ordered the XL according to the reviews that I read.,63730,3
63730,I was very disappointed that I could not wear it.,63730,3
63730,The fabric was not impressive and added to the lack of desirability.,63730,3
63730,The fit is extremely snug and unforgiving.,63730,3
63730,I don't think I would have worn it had I ordered a size up.,63730,3
63730,"If you wear any plus sized clothes because you carry weight in your bottom half, this outfit may not work.",63730,3
63730,"If you wear misses sizes, size up and give it a try.",63730,3
63731,quality is not the best,63731,3
63732,"I expected a sweater,  but it was tshirt material.",63732,3
63732,"The hems and seams are all crooked, and the""buttonhole"" is simply a small cut in the fabric.",63732,3
63732,"It is very cheaply made,  but I expected that for the price.",63732,3
63732,It's something I can easily fix and make work for me.,63732,3
63733,Product as seen in picture.,63733,3
63733,Might need to steam before wearing.,63733,3
63734,"Huge hat for my head, and I am an adult female.",63734,3
63734,Also where the patch is sewn in the front the areas around it are very indented which makes the patch stick out.,63734,3
63734,I am a cancer patient and purchased to wear going through treatment as well as on a boat.,63734,3
63734,"Either the packaging is horrible and there needs to be cardboard in the front to avoid the protrusion from the patch, or mine is just defective.",63734,3
63734,I will probably return for a better hat as I don't think I will wear this.,63734,3
63734,"Very large and you have to pull the hat all the way down to get out the patch to not look funny, and the hat covers your eyes.",63734,3
63735,nice but runs a bit big,63735,3
63736,Fit as described until they have been washed.,63736,3
63736,They don't stay up and that drives me crazy.,63736,3
63736,So they'll be going off in the Goodwill box.,63736,3
63737,A few of the links were loose and one was off in the bag with a charm.,63737,3
63737,Thank God it was a simple fix.,63737,3
63737,Love the look of the necklace.,63737,3
63738,The waist of the skirt was tight in the size medium.,63738,3
63739,"It fit, but the material is so cheap.",63739,3
63740,"I ordered a XXL in the shirt and it was still kind of small on them, but over all it worked for what we needed it for.",63740,3
63741,Faded in sun within a day.,63741,3
63741,But child loves it,63741,3
63742,Do not expect class A materials.,63742,3
63742,"China has many categories of quallity when manufacturing products, and refering to something cheap, they do mean it, but is stuff that you can replace anytime.",63742,3
63743,It was just cheep but it worked for the costume,63743,3
63744,Cheap Material very thin,63744,3
63745,I bought this in the orange poppy.,63745,3
63745,Not nearly as classy as it looks online.,63745,3
63745,"A little bit of gloss to the fabric makes it look cheap, and the zippers though well made have kind of a faded/ tarnished/ mismatched look to them.",63745,3
63745,The little jewelry pouch in the back is nice and seems well made.,63745,3
63745,The lining of the main pouch and pockets seems kind of chintzy as well.,63745,3
63745,Makes me feel like I am in junior high.,63745,3
63745,"The idea is good, but the execution not great.",63745,3
63746,Not great for small chests.,63746,3
63746,Feels soft and stretchy.,63746,3
63747,Great customer service but being a medium American size and bought this even XXL is still too small,63747,3
63748,The product is completely shear and and not the same fabric as the photo posted above.,63748,3
63748,I would not recommend but it was true to size and arrived earlier than expected.,63748,3
63749,Extremely comfortable but very large.,63749,3
63749,I use it as a nightie.,63749,3
63750,The box looked much bigger online.,63750,3
63750,It is teeny tiny.,63750,3
63750,I do like the earrings though.,63750,3
63751,Removed the sleeves because they were incredibly itchy!,63751,3
63752,The fit is tighter and the length shorter than expected,63752,3
63753,"Fit and control were perfect, however the item was not as sheer as I would have liked.",63753,3
63753,I purchased this to wear to an evening wedding and was disappointed that they appeared more like tights than sheer pantyhose.,63753,3
63753,"Will definitely wear again, but under pants - not with a dress.",63753,3
63754,The strap arrangement did not work out well on my type of suitcase because I needed to place it over where the handle pulled up to use the wheels.,63754,3
63754,"Therefore, I could not pull up the handle to use with the strap in position.",63754,3
63754,The straps and locking mechanism seem sturdy and it would probably work fine on a suitcase without a pull up handle.,63754,3
63754,I should have thought about the configuration of my suitcase before ordering.,63754,3
63755,For the price I'm happy bottoms run pretty small tho won't be wearing the bottoms that came with it.,63755,3
63756,"Love the color and bag but the shoulder strap has already broken, I've only had the bag for 2 days.",63756,3
63757,A3x is normally big but this is snug.,63757,3
63758,"Very cute, but I did not notice that it ships from China...unable to return as it runs small.",63758,3
63760,I love the dress but it doesn't fit,63760,3
63761,I was dreading not being able to button my skinnys anymore.,63761,3
63761,This band is a life saver!!,63761,3
63761,It stays in place and is beyond comfortable.,63761,3
63761,My only qualm is the color.,63761,3
63761,I ordered in white and when wearing it you can noticeably tell you pants are unbuttoned because the color is rather see-through.,63761,3
63761,You just have to layer it with a tank top that covers that lil discretion!,63761,3
63762,"First the positives- Absolutely gorgeous color, flows beautifully and keeps you modest with the linings.",63762,3
63762,"Now the negatives, the waistband is way too small and tight.",63762,3
63762,I'm a thin lady and it even gave me a muffin top.,63762,3
63762,Not only that but if I wore it for long periods of time it hurt.,63762,3
63762,"As much as I loved it, I had to return it.",63762,3
63762,It's really too bad.,63762,3
63763,"Too much glare for me, but for the price they served their purpose.",63763,3
63764,workmanship is below average,63764,3
63765,Purchase two sizes up to get your size.,63765,3
63767,Looks great but they sent the wrong size and i tipped the bag and couldn't send it back.,63767,3
63767,"The print is rich and clear tho
 I just wish i had the right size",63767,3
63768,Looks more feminine in person than in the photo.,63768,3
63768,A nice pin but I would not wear it.,63768,3
63769,Pretty cheap quality material,63769,3
63770,I thought it would be a little longer but it's not it actually fits like a very very short vest,63770,3
63771,"Poor customer service, great product",63771,3
63772,Decent underwear that does not ride up.,63772,3
63772,I purchased some in a local store and went online to purchase additional pairs with the same product name.,63772,3
63772,It turns our they were slightly different than the purchase I made in the store.,63772,3
63772,The band is thicker (though still a smooth fit) and the cotton content is higher (80%) which means they are less effective with moisture wicking.,63772,3
63773,I have slender arms and I can only wear with a shirt without sleeve.,63773,3
63773,Read other reviews and purchased an XL and I wear a medium normally.,63773,3
63774,I ordered and XL (I'm a D chest and a medium waist) and the top was too small.,63774,3
63774,It cuts in at the neck and underarms.,63774,3
63774,The bottoms fit for the most part though so I wear them with a plain black top.,63774,3
63775,I found it a bit tight around the collar.,63775,3
63775,I was also really disappointed that the material is really thin and see-through.,63775,3
63775,Don't wear red underwear!,63775,3
63775,Seriously you can only wear beige or light grey underneath.,63775,3
63775,"In the pix, it looks like it has pockets.",63775,3
63776,The skirt fits nice but the top was way too tight,63776,3
63777,"Very stretchy, good fit!",63777,3
63778,this is not a true size.,63778,3
63778,Unless you are a size 6 or less this will be to tight.,63778,3
63778,"I would have loved it for myself if it would have fit, but not I am using it for Christmas present",63778,3
63779,"The shoe is very sturdy, but a little bit small, and narrow.",63779,3
63780,The lace at the shoulders stretches a little too much for my tastes.,63780,3
63780,And the placement of the lace straps makes it difficult to find a bra that the straps won't be seen.,63780,3
63780,The material is somewhat heavier than I expected as well.,63780,3
63780,The length is good for wearing outside pants especially if you're trying to hide a little belly,63780,3
63781,great product but when wearing the bracelets without a hair band the ends scratch my skin.,63781,3
63782,"I love the look but quality leaves a lot to be desired, unfortunately.",63782,3
63782,"After only one week of using it on my trip, with just a wallet and a small camera inside, the long strap broke off.",63782,3
63782,"Sad, but I have to return it.",63782,3
63782,"Otherwise, it is a beautiful beautiful bag.",63782,3
63782,"Indeed, I did not expect such bad strap quality from such a good brand.",63782,3
63782,I wanted to keep it but paying over 120 dollars for something that breaks so fast - I think it is not fair...,63782,3
63783,The shirt itself is great.,63783,3
63783,"The description lists this as a ""girls"" shirt, but clearly is not in youth sizes.",63783,3
63783,I ordered the large for my 9 year old who wears 10/12 and it goes down to her knees.,63783,3
63784,Definitely small where it counts when it's GO time!,63784,3
63785,"The bottoms are great, fit perfectly and I pair them with different tops.",63785,3
63785,The red top that came with is cute but so small for my chest (38C) and it actually tore in the middle when I was trying to adjust it.,63785,3
63788,They are cute but not exactly one size fits all.,63788,3
63788,I'm a size 6 and they're much too big.,63788,3
63789,"nice shoes, poor construction, my son destroyed in 2 weeks",63789,3
63791,"It was bent up when I received it, plus it ran a bit small",63791,3
63794,It came shipped quickly..,63794,3
63794,"But since they only use China sizes, it didn't fit..",63794,3
63794,"They should really do custom orders when asked, especially if bought by someone in the USA..",63794,3
63795,I am medium and the large size its tight go 2 sizes up!!,63795,3
63796,Very bulky and runs large.,63796,3
63797,I bought these half hoping half cursing (because I already own pretty much all colors of the latter) they were the same as Patty Boutique items of the same style.,63797,3
63797,I love this slashed style!,63797,3
63797,"The style does indeed mimic the Patty tops, but the material is much less stretchy and more shiny.",63797,3
63797,I got small size in both but this one fits much tighter.,63797,3
63797,It's OK for the price but there's no comparison in terms of quality.,63797,3
63798,They are nice but look HUGE.,63798,3
63798,Like they are XL... other than that I have no issues,63798,3
63799,The construction/build of this hat is a bit off.,63799,3
63799,You mite want to look elsewhere.,63799,3
63800,Fortunately I saw they ran small so order way big and it fit fine.,63800,3
63801,Asian 2 = US 12-14.,63801,3
63801,"My size is 14, I am 1.72 mts tall and fit perfectly.",63801,3
63801,If you are a shorter person will look extrange.,63801,3
63801,I wouldn't buy it again because you can tan nicely due to the frame.,63801,3
63802,The leggins seem to be really cheap quality and the fit isn't right at all.,63802,3
63802,Would fit a 3-4 year old not a baby a 6-9month old like i ordered.,63802,3
63802,I am bummed but I cant be shocked after all it is really cheap.,63802,3
63803,We love the dress but had to reorder 3 times going down in size.,63803,3
63805,Button broke off immediately as I put it on.,63805,3
63805,Looks somewhat like the picture.,63805,3
63805,Not near as loose,63805,3
63807,I bought the navy color.,63807,3
63807,"When I received it, it had some wrinkles that I had to iron it.",63807,3
63807,I usually wear size 4P or 4.,63807,3
63807,This sweater fits me fine.,63807,3
63807,"The shoulders are a little wider than my real shoulders but because it's not loose, it doesn't add obvious width to my shoulders.",63807,3
63807,It's very warm to wear.,63807,3
63807,"Once I put it on, I haven't felt ""cold"" the whole day.",63807,3
63807,"The material is soft and very stretchable so that even if there is no extra room in arms and elbows, it moves with me that I don't feel unbearable tightness.",63807,3
63807,It's very comfortable to wear.,63807,3
63807,I like the length that covers my bottom.,63807,3
63807,The lower part of the sweater is very forgiving being flared out with ample room underneath.,63807,3
63807,"I would just wear short-sleeve or sleeveless top inside as if I wear long sleeves, it would be not easy to pull up the sweater from the elbows to upper arms due to tightness.",63807,3
63807,I would be careful in pulling it.,63807,3
63807,"Since the material is very stretchable, if you pull hard, you could see your own fingers through the material that if not careful, it's possible to pull out a hole with long sharp nails.",63807,3
63807,The collar can be worn rolled up or down.,63807,3
63807,"When it's cold, I can roll it up that has the effect of a scarf to keep me warm.",63807,3
63807,"When it's not that cold, I can wear it down that is very versatile.",63807,3
63807,"This sweater although is very warm, it pilled after I wore it for two months.",63807,3
63807,There are many small balls under my elbows.,63807,3
63807,"It's perfect for my casual wear at work that looks sophisticated with its flattering shape, instead of just a regular rectangular shaped sweater without waist line.",63807,3
63807,It's a more refined everyday sweater.,63807,3
63808,This is note made correctly at the top.,63808,3
63808,I am returning this..,63808,3
63809,It was a little longer than I wanted so I cut about 2 inches off the bottom- but- better than being too short!,63809,3
63810,I purchased several tights at the time these were purchased and the others were too large and these were way too small.,63810,3
63810,The torso area was incredibly short and barely fit my 13 year old daughter.,63810,3
63810,"Otherwise, the design and quality are really great.",63810,3
63811,"Fits weird in the back, it's not form fit as the picture shows, no elastic material.",63811,3
63812,This skirt looked very stylish online so I bought the gray one.,63812,3
63813,"Thought these were for young girl age 7, but definitely are for teens..Good quality just not clear on sizing.",63813,3
63814,I liked it and it is cute but the short was dirty and there was no waist adjusting.,63814,3
63814,My girl is thin and the short is big on her i have to take it to the tailor for fixing the waist.,63814,3
63815,Item was missing a pieces on the bra straps n bottom was fitted to tight,63815,3
63816,"I purchased this at 8 months into my pregnancy, hoping it'd be what I needed to last me the rest of the way and into nursing.",63816,3
63816,"It's really cute, first, and material is quite soft.",63816,3
63816,"But, the black nursing tank just fell apart immediately.",63816,3
63816,"The stitching around the mid-section, where you'd need it to hold up for nursing, just let go.",63816,3
63816,"It already fit a little big, so it wasn't that I was needing more room than possible.",63816,3
63816,"Also, one arm on the robe also has loose stitching where it just let go.",63816,3
63816,"So now, one arm hangs lower than the other and it bothers me.",63816,3
63816,"For the price, I'd expect better quality and really bummed.",63816,3
63816,The tank will not work out for nursing as it just won't hold anything up.,63816,3
63817,"I wear a women's size 7 and these are uncomfortably tight; yes, I can SQUEEZE my feet and toes into the socks, yes, they are stretchy; however, once you DO manage to maneuver them on, they are TIGHT and NOT comfortable.",63817,3
63817,I can say that the colors are cute.,63817,3
63817,I bought them for balance issues and will have to buy a different brand now.,63817,3
63818,I ordered a 3XL and I am a L or XL.,63818,3
63819,Runs small so have not worn,63819,3
63820,good for what you pay- makes me have a Madona boob a bit but functional- nice material and fit,63820,3
63821,"These socks have a strange fit - toes are too big, but grips barely cover heel.",63821,3
63821,They are not cushioned at all - very thin.,63821,3
63821,I'm a size 7 1/2 womens on the narrowish size.,63821,3
63821,Would like the elastic around the edges to be better too.,63821,3
63821,Overall I don't like and will not purchase again.,63821,3
63821,"However, the seller was very responsive and issued a refund, so I added a star.",63821,3
63822,It is what I expected.,63822,3
63822,I just didn't expect the main stone to fall off as I opened the package.,63822,3
63822,I assume the glue holding just wasn't enough.,63822,3
63823,"And despite the suggestive name, NOT Made in America.",63823,3
63825,"soft, but they roll up my leg like any other boxer brief.",63825,3
63826,don't wash it shrinks big time,63826,3
63827,"quality good, color true to photo, timely delivery - ordered Medium based on size chart, I wear Medium in US (size 8), and this shirtdress runs small in sleeve and chest diameter (i moderately weight train) order next size up.",63827,3
63828,(Lace 2) I have mixed emotions on this top.,63828,3
63828,There's is no question that It looks fabulous on!,63828,3
63828,I had lots of compliments everywhere I went wearing it.,63828,3
63828,"However, the stitching is pooringly done and I had to resew.",63828,3
63828,The lace was coming off after once use and so was the collar.,63828,3
63828,But I fixed it and we're back in business.,63828,3
63828,"I am 5'6"" 125lbs and ordered a small.",63828,3
63828,"The top is flowy and ends 5"" from my knees.",63828,3
63828,Like I said it looks great on as long as you can sew to mend the pieces.,63828,3
63829,"After a couple of months of use, the watch is still as adorable as when originally purchased.",63829,3
63829,"Definitely a kid size watch, though.",63829,3
63829,Only purchase if you have tiny wrists.,63829,3
63829,"The strap isn't looking to good but could most likely get replaced, and the face of the watch scratches really easily.",63829,3
63830,cute but to large for the person i buyed this for.,63830,3
63831,Love the feeling on my skin.,63831,3
63831,"Nice and silky smooth, almost a turn on!",63831,3
63831,"However, the inner pouch is too small to contain my two friends, Whenever I have to move and while sitting, they seem to be outside.",63831,3
63831,"I don't know if they are searching for air, or what!",63831,3
63831,They nee a wider pouch at the bottom!,63831,3
63831,I will continue to wear them anyway!,63831,3
63832,Not made very well.,63832,3
63833,These are incredibly unnatractive but very comfortable.,63833,3
63834,nice but look a little cheep,63834,3
63835,Good fit & light material,63835,3
63836,Can't get the back open to put in battery.,63836,3
63836,Did not know it had hinges..,63836,3
63837,"Two things though, one minor and easy fix, the other is a glaring problem.",63837,3
63837,First threading of this item is sticking out of where the hat meets the bill.,63837,3
63837,"No biggie, but should be noted.",63837,3
63837,The other is really pushing my OCD and that the logo is crooked.,63837,3
63837,"I mean really noticeable crooked, that if I was a bystander and saw the hat, I would think it's a generic PKMN hat, but it has their official logo on the back!",63837,3
63837,"I know the hat was under $10, but really, a little more attention to what was being done, would have earned the 5 starts.",63837,3
63837,Look at the pics and tell me if I'm just being picky,63837,3
63838,CHEAP MATERIAL..still cute though,63838,3
63839,Went by size chart which wasn't totally correct - Not a big issue for me but others might want to consider going two sizes above their usual U.S. sizing - Ordered the size above and it was still a little too snug - ordered two sizes up and perfect.....,63839,3
63840,if you look at the time on a angle you see  only 0000 on day light  you need to  look right on top of the watch to see the time  also when you buckle the bend  the ring that holds the end of the bend keeps sliding  off is to loose THE WATCH IS NICE .,63840,3
63841,"Material is pretty thin, the white is very see through.",63841,3
63841,I would order up at least one size though as they seem to run quite small.,63841,3
63842,I was hopine it would be oversized and comfortable like in the picture.,63842,3
63842,It's a bit smaller but is still comfortable and fits just fine.,63842,3
63843,"I ordered a large based on other reviews, but it was baggy around my midsection.",63843,3
63843,It also arrived with a tear near my right hip.,63843,3
63843,I sewed it up and washed it in hot water and it helped a little.,63843,3
63844,Very pretty but turns my finger green.,63844,3
63845,I love the purse but it slides off shoulder when wearing a coat!,63845,3
63846,Update after a 3 week trip to Europe.,63846,3
63846,"Pros:
Fast drying
Stayed up, did not pool around shoe tops
Cons:
No moisture wicking - Feet felt wet all day
Very thin - no cushioning
Definitely NOT for wear with walking shoes/boots

Next time I may try using them as heavy sock liners.",63846,3
63846,Rinse them out each night and re-ware the heavy socks for a few days.,63846,3
63847,"It's a little cheaply made, but as an under blouse for a suit for a special occasion where you will probably not take the suit jacket off, it's okay.",63847,3
63848,"Nice, but too big for me",63848,3
63849,"I love these yoga pants - but after only a couple of wears, the seams are already starting to come apart/fray.",63849,3
63849,They feel like great quality other than that.,63849,3
63850,I may return them too narrow!,63850,3
63851,Beautiful kimono cover up.,63851,3
63851,"I really loved this, but unfortunately, it started falling apart after about two months.",63851,3
63851,The tassels started shedding about 1.5 months after purchase and wearing it about 10 times.,63851,3
63851,"I guess I can't really complain for a $10 purchase, but I wish it had lasted longer.",63851,3
63852,"The fabric and style is really pretty but it fits really, really small!",63852,3
63852,I bought a Lg/XL and it was still too small and I'm not a big person,63852,3
63853,"I ordered the large according the size chart where I normally where a 10, but it was extremely too large.",63853,3
63853,I want to reorder again but skeptical about the size if I should get a medium or small.,63853,3
63854,It's well made and the shipping was very fast.,63854,3
63854,But the loops are fairly large and press into underside of your wrist whenever you put your hands on a flat surface (typing for instance) .,63854,3
63854,I expect I'll go back to a band with cloth retaining loops.,63854,3
63855,cuts into my armpits.,63855,3
63856,I like the shirt but it's a little snug and I will have to do some altering to the strap on the side.,63856,3
63856,In tops I usually by a M/L.,63856,3
63856,I bought an XL because I was ordering it online.,63856,3
63856,I probably should have bought a XXL.,63856,3
63856,I wanted it to look like the model in the picture.,63856,3
63857,Strap broke after only a week but for 8 dollars what do I expect.,63857,3
63857,Pretty though and got some use out of it.,63857,3
63858,Very small but there beautiful !,63858,3
63859,Did not come with 120 volt plug to power light.,63859,3
63860,Cute but cheaper looking in person than expected.,63860,3
63860,The material is a tad rougher than I thought.,63860,3
63860,"Hence, why I purchased the shirt with polyester blend.",63860,3
63861,Cute but not the size I expected,63861,3
63862,The ring Turn brown,63862,3
63863,"Top fitted well, but the pants are small.",63863,3
63864,Adorable but the fabric of the flower can come unraveled pretty quickly,63864,3
63865,T shirt quality was on the lower end given the cheap price.,63865,3
63866,Size runs very large and the color was darker than what the picture shows,63866,3
63867,Although I noticed some spots on the plastic were started to weaken.,63867,3
63867,Could find a better product.,63867,3
63868,I like the style and color but fits a little small.,63868,3
63869,Pretty flower but the pin has a cheap clasp.,63869,3
63869,It's not the kind that locks the pin.,63869,3
63869,I would say it deserves 3 1/2 stars.,63869,3
63870,"The chest was tight and the overall fit was a bit short, but it looked it okay.",63870,3
63872,I ordered in the same size I always wear but it runs small.,63872,3
63872,Wish I had ordered o e size larger but over all the quality is good.,63872,3
63872,Somewhat thin but still ok.,63872,3
63873,Bag was smaller than expected and material kinda cheap.,63873,3
63873,Shipped very quickly and very satisfied with that.,63873,3
63873,It was a gift for my nephew and he actually loves it........just don't know how long it will hold up for him for he uses it everyday and quality of the material is not very strong,63873,3
63874,"Nice quality, but smaller than I thought.",63874,3
63874,I may return it for something larger.,63874,3
63876,Bit smaller than expected,63876,3
63877,I received 2 navy and one charcoal... the charcoal and black were really the ones I wanted :(,63877,3
63878,"The necklace was cute, material was a little flimsy/cheaply made.",63878,3
63878,The arrow that goes in the circle kept getting tangled with the ray of the bangles.,63878,3
63879,Would have been a nice top to wear to work if it fit.,63879,3
63879,"I ordered and XXL, I usually wear an XL.",63879,3
63879,This is way to tight.,63879,3
63879,It's more like a Medium.,63879,3
63880,The earring backs did not fit the earrings I had at all.,63880,3
63881,i order a XL i am a regular us M and it fits a bit big but its better than small.. the fabric is not the best it feels and looks soooo cheap like paper but its a cute dress..,63881,3
63883,"I'm 5'1, a-b cup, 130 and ordered the small.",63883,3
63883,The torso was to short in the bathing suit and I don't have a long torso.,63883,3
63883,I do however love the concept of the bathing suit.,63883,3
63883,Going to return and try the medium.,63883,3
63884,"I ordered a black pair but I ended up getting a red pair instead, which made me disappointed, but it's whatever cause it still looks nice.",63884,3
63884,I'm 5'3 and they come up right up to my mid-thigh.,63884,3
63886,Very nice shirt but it is very small!,63886,3
63886,"I ordered my 14 yr old daughter a L thinking she could get 2 years out of it, more like 2 wears.",63886,3
63886,Daughter is a women's S/m in all other clothing.,63886,3
63887,Bought these because I thought the faux lace look was pretty.,63887,3
63887,They are advertised as a pack with 5 lace pairs.,63887,3
63887,"However, I only got 3 pairs with lace and two solid color pieces!!",63887,3
63887,It's not right to advertise them as a 5 pack but they aren't all lace pattern!,63887,3
63887,"However, they washed up nice and are very soft.",63887,3
63887,They fit fine but I noticed that they are not cut as big as they use to be so I had to go up in size,63887,3
63888,I love the design and the polarized lenses that I wore them every day.,63888,3
63888,Unfortunately one of the screws came loose during a walk around town and the nose pad disconnected from my glasses and I can't find the screw anymore.,63888,3
63888,"Nevertheless, great pair of sunglasses.",63888,3
63888,Just make sure to tighten the screws.,63888,3
63889,"ordered white , but arrived dirty color white.",63889,3
63890,Compression elastic slides down necessitating constant need to pull back up.,63890,3
63890,Shoulder straps too long.,63890,3
63891,The style and fabric are ok but not really good quality.,63891,3
63892,I was replacing one that I had for several years.,63892,3
63892,"This one would not hold all the items, ok if you have cards you want to file individually, but I wanted to put 2-3 cards per slot like the one I had.",63892,3
63893,"For the price, these are really good.",63893,3
63893,They seem to be polarized as stated and they definitely reduce glare.,63893,3
63893,"However, they are a bit snug, even though I have a smaller head than most people (a snug fit can be good since they won't fall off as easily, but time will tell if they are comfortable for longer periods of time).",63893,3
63893,"So far I've only worn them for about 20 mins at a time, and they are fine for that amount of time.",63893,3
63893,I haven't had them long enough to determine if they are comfortable for longer than that yet.,63893,3
63893,"22 Jun 2016:  For the price, these are still good, but I would NOT recommend wearing for very long.",63893,3
63893,These eventually dig into your head and leave dimples.,63893,3
63893,It definitely is uncomfortable over time!,63893,3
63893,"For brief use, they are fine, so it just depends on how long you plan to wear these.",63893,3
63893,"For me, I usually use them on the drive home or to work.",63893,3
63894,Really cute and my daughter loves them but the fit is off.,63894,3
63894,"Her foot size is a 13, I ordered a size 1 and her toes are right at the end.",63894,3
63894,She can wear them but they won't fit for long.,63894,3
63896,It is small though the upper back and shoulders.,63896,3
63896,No extra material in the seems to be let out.,63896,3
63897,Thought that the fins would be ridged.,63897,3
63898,Really cute but tight above the knee,63898,3
63899,"I bought this as an underlayer for my son's Halloween costume, and it served that purpose well, but I don't expect we'll use it many more times, if any.",63899,3
63899,"It runs a little small, and the fabric isn't very soft.",63899,3
63899,"My son didn't complain, but I don't like putting him in clothes I wouldn't want next to my skin.",63899,3
63901,"Order a size up, it will be very tight even then, also it's not like the picture where it'll cover your full butt, cheeks will be out I promise you",63901,3
63902,"This dress is what you would expect for the price point, comfortable and cute but simple fabrics in a basic construction.",63902,3
63902,"The belly fit on me was not as flattering as that in the image, it just hung down from my widest point without any real shape to it.",63902,3
63902,I ended up preferring the floor length version that had a bit more stretch and figure-flattering shape.,63902,3
63903,"The edges are a bit sharp, as long as you don't have anything pushing it towards your hand (and thus against your wrist as it widens) it shouldn't be much trouble.",63903,3
63903,"The clasp has been satisfactory, though moving the stationary clip to adjust the size is a real pain.",63903,3
63903,Good thing it's a set-it-and-forget-it part of the band.,63903,3
63903,"Overall, I think they need to literally smooth out the edges, then this would be better.",63903,3
63904,Only had it a week wore it once and a gem fell off so hurt.,63904,3
63905,Cuter in the photo :(,63905,3
63906,Size was difficult to determine.,63906,3
63906,Some type of measurement would have been helpful.,63906,3
63907,Being concerned about European sizing I contracted DJ's Boardshop by e-mail and I received a response saying they only sold clothing with US sizes and attached a normal sizing table with Large having a chest size of 42-44 inches.,63907,3
63907,After receiving the jacket and noticing the tightness I went to the 2117 Sweden website and according to them their mens clothing L has a chest measurement of 104 centimeters or 41 inches.,63907,3
63907,The smallness makes it very difficult to properly layer.,63907,3
63907,The overall quality seems ok but order a size larger than normal so that you can wear something thick and warm underneath.,63907,3
63908,"I ordered a large, but it looks like it's for a child.",63908,3
63909,"The band itself is nice enough, but it would've been nice if they would have included spring bars.",63909,3
63909,The band on my Huawei watch has quick release bars which don't come out easy so I had to buy new bars.,63909,3
63909,It does come in a nice (and really unnecessary) box.,63909,3
63909,They should save money on the box and include pins.,63909,3
63910,I love the underwear.,63910,3
63910,It fits and feels great!,63910,3
63910,The only issue I had was that I ordered the blue pair labeled Wednesday and received Sunday which is a Navy/Midnight blue color.,63910,3
63910,"I do plan on ordering more, just hope I get exactly what I order next time.",63910,3
63911,Long  lead time for delivery and product arrived one day ahead of schedule.,63911,3
63911,It is extremely delicate and not for everyday or work use.,63911,3
63911,Care instruction is in Chinese.,63911,3
63911,Item is smaller in size than USA sizes - Extra Large is medium USA size.,63911,3
63912,But after only one day the dress was ripped,63912,3
63913,This hat looks great and my fianc was excited for it but it was to small and I ordered it the right size.,63913,3
63913,We just gave it to our son and he is happy.. Lol,63913,3
63914,Add says black in color but I think it's more of a charcoal grayish.,63914,3
63914,Mutch thinner than the one I got last time as well.,63914,3
63915,"Really a cute coat, but fits super small.",63915,3
63915,Order a couple sizes up.,63915,3
63916,While it does fit reasonable well if I wear it for more then a few hours it starts to hurt my ribs.,63916,3
63916,"My recommendation for anyone buying this is to, no matter what, buy the next size bigger you will thank yourself later.",63916,3
63917,Much larger than I anticipated.,63917,3
63918,they are a little short for being sold as 36x34.,63918,3
63919,"The item runs very small, I sent it back for an exchange.",63919,3
63921,I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly.,63921,3
63921,"It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it could use a couple more along the length to make it more correctly fitted to a variety of hats.",63921,3
63921,"I also got this in black, this one isn't quite as long as the black, and the inner end isn't as well put together on this one as the black one was.",63921,3
63922,Bought them for a friend but they were so small I had to give them to my 8 yr old.,63922,3
63922,They're really cute though.,63922,3
63923,runs small in size,63923,3
63924,"skirt doesn't look like that, but it isn't hideous.",63924,3
63924,the crop top is definitely see through.,63924,3
63924,"for the skirt, the one i got has a slit a little too close to the front instead of the side & it comes up pretty high.",63924,3
63924,"something i'd wear around the house, don't know if i'd wear it in public",63924,3
63925,It doesn't actual cover my stomach area.,63925,3
63925,there is about a 3 inch gap from the top and you can see it though my clothes and its not long enough at all.,63925,3
63926,This is a nicely designed suit and very well made.,63926,3
63926,The proportions are impractical.,63926,3
63926,I have a large bust and the cups are padded unnecessarily and the straps are so thin.,63926,3
63926,"It's a pretty suit, but for me, it will not work.",63926,3
63926,I need to return.,63926,3
63927,I love the look,63927,3
63928,the brown frame the lenses  popped out a couple of time not to happy,63928,3
63929,Well...you get what you pay for!,63929,3
63929,It's really cute with a place for everything.,63929,3
63929,Lasted about 1 month.,63929,3
63929,Just went to open the snap and it ripped from the material.,63929,3
63930,My son is just getting into 3T clothes and the 2T-3T socks are a bit small.,63930,3
63930,I would probably order the next size larger.,63930,3
63932,Its small but ok i guess the waist area  good fit is just the front area too small,63932,3
63934,Bought these for a sweater party while deployed over Christmas.,63934,3
63934,The shipping to Absurdistan was fairly quick.,63934,3
63934,I read many of the reviews which said it runs small in the arms so I ordered a Large.,63934,3
63934,I should have gotten an XL.,63934,3
63934,I have laughably skinny arms for my build and they still fit to snuggly .,63934,3
63934,"That fact, with my broadish shoulders makes a lot of fabric gather up at the shoulders.",63934,3
63934,End result: Looks like I have on shoulder pads.,63934,3
63934,It is warm though.,63934,3
63934,"Cons:
Runs small in JUST the arms.",63934,3
63934,Stitching around neck is very rough and rubs on you.,63934,3
63934,Expensive for what you get.,63934,3
63935,"nice product, just toooooo small",63935,3
63936,This product fits ok not perfect!!!,63936,3
63936,It has the tendency to ride in your butt!,63936,3
63936,Be sure to go a size up!,63936,3
63937,Order a size up,63937,3
63938,Item shipped great and looks beautiful.,63938,3
63938,There are even tiny sparkles in the design that you can't really see in the picture.,63938,3
63938,"Got this for my mom, she's gonna love it!",63938,3
63938,Edit*  4 months in and the clasp is not holding.,63938,3
63938,Mom had to buy another one.,63938,3
63939,"The color is more ""red"" than it appears here.",63939,3
63940,I have a fairly narrow nose and to get the glasses back close enough to my face to make wearing sunglasses worth it the nose pieces where poking me in the tear ducks.,63940,3
63940,May be this style of sunglasses but i have never had wrap arounds that sat so far out just because of the goofy nose piece.,63940,3
63940,SEEMED FINE OTHERWISE nice case good presentation.,63940,3
63940,Can't give it a high rating after putting it on once for 10 sec and just returning the item.,63940,3
63940,Just didn't work for me.,63940,3
63941,Mine didn't look like the picture.,63941,3
63941,There was no brim on the front which was why I liked it.,63941,3
63941,Disappointed but it keeps my baby's head warm.,63941,3
63942,cheaply made and small,63942,3
63943,"but, it could be me.",63943,3
63943,I hadn't realized it was a 'slim' fit when I purchased it.,63943,3
63944,It is cute but I am not very crazy about the material it's sort of a fleece would be better in a more tailored and crisp material.,63944,3
63946,They have a tendency to slip and can fall off from timed to time.,63946,3
63947,Cup size a bit large and length shorter than expected.,63947,3
63948,This dress is very thin material.,63948,3
63948,So thin that the edges of the garment show under the fabric.,63948,3
63950,It's ok but kind of small,63950,3
63951,Ordered a small in white & had a little small brown stain on bottkm outer lining.. will need to wash.,63951,3
63951,"It is not as flare as it looks to be from the seller, seems a bit stiff.",63951,3
63951,Other than that it is wearable.,63951,3
63952,I purchased the black floral print with long sleeves and the white at the same time.,63952,3
63952,"I thought that they'd be pretty similar, just with different patterns, but boy was I wrong.",63952,3
63952,"The black one is to die for; seriously, buy it.",63952,3
63952,"The white one is a complete opposite, it's made with weird stiff fabric and singes really high up.",63952,3
63952,"The sleeves are too large and don't flow, they just look out of place.",63952,3
63952,"If you're super good at 50's type looks, then you might be able to pull it off, but I wouldn't take the chance.",63952,3
63953,Got this to wear to my baby shower.,63953,3
63953,"I'm only 4'10"" so a maxi dress is impossible to find.",63953,3
63953,It fit great though - with my belly in the way it wasn't too long lol!,63953,3
63953,Otherwise I think it would have hit the ground.,63953,3
63953,I was very comfortable though.,63953,3
63953,I do suggest wearing things underneath it as it's very sheer.,63953,3
63953,I wore comfy spandex shorts with a  white sports bra and tank - worked out great for a hot day in June!,63953,3
63954,Item runs kind of small the top fit but I have a small top frame and a chunky bottom so the bottom fit like a thong almost if I were less hippy I'm sure it would have fit perfect,63954,3
63955,Fits nice it's a good shoe,63955,3
63956,Nice colors and good to mix with another bracelet I purchased.,63956,3
63957,2 of the buttons came off within an hour of being worn.,63957,3
63958,"Good material, just the wrong size.",63958,3
63959,Bigger than I expected or wanted it to be,63959,3
63960,"Nice style, a bit small and short.",63960,3
63961,"For the price, I wish the cedar scent would last a little longer.",63961,3
63961,I freshen them up with cedar oil every few weeks.,63961,3
63961,Great product and about the only thing that consistently helps with my foot odor.,63961,3
63961,"Just wish the price weren't so high, as they do deteriorate within a couple of months.",63961,3
63962,The price is right.,63962,3
63962,"But like others have said, the inside ""fluff"" does fall out.",63962,3
63962,It can be aggravating.,63962,3
63963,Way way too small.,63963,3
63964,These are exactly as promised.,63964,3
63964,"The D battery was a bit cumbersome, and I had a hard time getting them down into my wader boot.",63964,3
63964,"The sock band was a bit tight, and didn't let me pull them up to get quite snug enough around the calf to really get the sock tight on my foot, but I suppose it's necessary to counter the weight of the battery.",63964,3
63964,I think they'd be better utilizing a 9V.,63964,3
63964,"The battery compartment doesn't really get a good firm fit in the battery, so I'm not sure if they stayed on the whole time.",63964,3
63964,"The socks were warm, and did the job, but I wouldn't mind just a tad warmer.",63964,3
63964,"In the end, they did what they promised and only cost $30 total.",63964,3
63964,"Overall, they're good enough until I want to drop more money on a nicer alternative.",63964,3
63965,It is so pretty but is little  small .,63965,3
63966,"<div id=""video-block-R13PMK5BW43F4P"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1obxK58NIS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qZ3OrneLS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;I really love these shoes, just received them in the mail!",63966,3
63966,"However, they don't quite fit.",63966,3
63966,I ordered the regular small because I'm usually a 6.5-7 in shoes depending on the brand.,63966,3
63966,"These are a bit large for me, like half a shoe size to even a shoe size too big.",63966,3
63966,I had my grandmother try it on to see how it fit (she's a 7.5) and she said it was tight.,63966,3
63966,Either I'm more of a 6.5 according to this shoe or it's just made not for my foot shape.,63966,3
63966,For the price I will keep them because I really love them; Rainbow Dash is my favorite pony and these shoes are comfortable.,63966,3
63966,I put a Dr. Scholl's in it to take up some space and am keeping the tissue that the shoe came with inside the shoes to fill up the end so that my feet don't fall out.,63966,3
63966,"Without socks my feet are coming up and out of the shoe constantly, and with socks they still didn't fit so that has been my solution.",63966,3
63966,I wish the sizes that were listed were more true to themselves and a little more detailed as to what shoe size they fit.,63966,3
63966,"I chose the Small over the Small (7-8), but now I wonder if I should've gone with that size.",63966,3
63966,"Only get this shoe size if you know you're a 7 or 7.5 in shoes normally, not someone who fluctuates solely based on brand between 7 and 6.5 because it didn't fit me.",63966,3
63966,The video in my review shoes me first trying on a shoe as is and showing that when I walk it comes off and doesn't fit.,63966,3
63966,"Then I show the second shoe and the amendments I made to it to make it fit, and show me walking in it and it not slipping off.",63966,3
63966,"The colors are great, the shoes came in great condition, but the sizing was too big for me without mending them myself.",63966,3
63967,Perfect dress just way too big.,63967,3
63968,I'm a 38 D and the top was odd.,63968,3
63968,The back strap was too thin and did not support my girls.,63968,3
63968,The cup and strap combo fit oddly and I was constantly tugging on them.,63968,3
63968,But for the money it was cute.,63968,3
63968,I got a lot of compliments.,63968,3
63968,The bottoms fit but way too skimpy for my tastes so I work a skirt.,63968,3
63969,Didn't like the look and fit was a little small,63969,3
63971,Not great for long wear.,63971,3
63972,Really liked it then it broke,63972,3
63973,The size is off the fall out of my ears,63973,3
63974,"I am 5' 5"" and will have to wear leggings underneath.",63974,3
63974,Or keep for the beach.,63974,3
63975,"I actually returned this bag,as I was looking for more of a larger tote for school.",63975,3
63975,If I was looking for more of an everyday tote I would have kept the bag.,63975,3
63975,The color is not the same as advertised but it's still a cute bag.,63975,3
63977,The swearers ran small,63977,3
63978,I liked this But it fit kinda where I was comfortable wearing it.,63978,3
63979,"I like it, chain is good but the shipment was a lil difficult as I understand that packaging a product from product as in general life keeping up is hard, I'm glad the replacement was made good job!",63979,3
63980,"Fit well except arm do not fit right, smaller and rides high.",63980,3
63981,"Gave it as a gift to my niece, but she doesnt love Sriracha.... lol",63981,3
63982,The purple on the screen is much richer than the color of the actual shirt.,63982,3
63982,Also the sleeves are not flowy.,63982,3
63982,I returned it because it just looked too matronly with the sleeves sticking to my arms.,63982,3
63982,"It's hard to describe, but it's mini pleated and causes static cling.",63982,3
63983,Cute and practical style but very cheap feeling fabric.,63983,3
63983,I was disappointed and had to return it.,63983,3
63984,"I am always skeptical of buying clothes off of Amazon (particularly from China), but I took a chance.",63984,3
63984,"Even though I ordered the largest size offered, I still couldn't fit this over my chest.",63984,3
63984,"I do have an ample chest, but I was mostly concerned that it would be too short.",63984,3
63984,"Still, I bought it anyway thinking I could wear it with a cute pair of short shorts.",63984,3
63984,That's not going to work out.,63984,3
63984,I will try to resell it or give it to a friend as a gift.,63984,3
63984,It's still really cute so I'm disappointed that it doesn't fit.,63984,3
63984,"If you are small chested, this will be a good buy for you!",63984,3
63985,"Warm material...prefect for my son, who won't stay covered at night.",63985,3
63985,Runs a little short compared to other sleepers and is loose fitting.,63985,3
63986,The dress is too smal in the chest and it is a side zip so I cannot fix it.,63986,3
63986,"The rest of it fits beautifully and I love it, pout.",63986,3
63987,The logo in the front seemed as if it was worn and had a bunch of white marks like deodorant.,63987,3
63988,The bra is bigger and the cup pokes out but not in an attractive way.,63988,3
63988,You get it in about 2weeks to three.,63988,3
63988,The bottom is very awkward if it doesn't fit properly.,63988,3
63988,Cute but runs small.,63988,3
63989,"It's smaller in real life then in the photo...
 :-( she trashed it...  :-(",63989,3
63990,"Somewhat small, material is thicker then expected.",63990,3
63990,The neck lace area where the collarbone sits is a little awkward.,63990,3
63990,Now I can see why people are tucking it in or cutting it off.,63990,3
63990,Other then that it is good!,63990,3
63990,I suggest buying a size or two larger!,63990,3
63991,Was far too large for our 5lb baby,63991,3
63992,"Odd fit...very wide and loose fitting (which I expected, based on the style), but it's MUCH shorter than the picture.",63992,3
63992,"The bottom of the shirt sits *just* below the waist of my jeans/just below my hips, no where near as log as shown in the picture!",63992,3
63992,"Not very flattering, but it's comfy and it was inexpensive, so I'll probably keep it for lounging around the house.",63992,3
63993,I like the shirt but it was a little bit too high in tha bottom part,63993,3
63994,You had better have small feet/ankles.,63994,3
63996,Good watch for collection!,63996,3
63997,I like that the pants are high waisted.,63997,3
63997,But the leggings are very thin.,63997,3
63997,I almost feel like I'm wearing tights.,63997,3
63997,"I bought them for yoga class, but now I can't wear them.",63997,3
63998,"They say 100% cotton, NOT WOOL.",63998,3
63998,IT CONTAINS 2 PAIRS.,63998,3
63998,"Otherwise, they're soft and appear comfortable.",63998,3
63999,"Would have been great, but way too small - pants cannot be a 34 - unfortunately, my husband had removed the tags before trying it on - now what do I do with it?",63999,3
64001,"Only getting the smaller size, not so great.",64001,3
64001,Looks nice but I have to use the very last hole.,64001,3
64002,Fit a little tightly in with bust and the back comes down very far and there is no way that you could wear a normal bra with it.,64002,3
64002,Overall it was not what I was looking for and I sent it back.,64002,3
64003,I am really happy with these yoga pants.,64003,3
64003,So comfortable and flattering... And didn't break the bank.,64003,3
64003,Update: These seem much thinner than the heather grey I ordered a few months ago.,64003,3
64004,"Cute, but way small, order 2 sizes up",64004,3
64005,I got this shirt to wear with tights.,64005,3
64005,"The shirt length is good for that, but it runs on the small side.",64005,3
64005,Tighter fitting than I like to wear.,64005,3
64005,"So my advice, order a size bigger!",64005,3
64006,It's a little on the small side for me.,64006,3
64007,Just extra fabric on the top doesn't look right,64007,3
64008,Spend a little more money and get a better quality one piece.,64008,3
64008,I cannot wear this in public without pasties or a bralette underneath because the material is so sheer,64008,3
64009,"sleeves are extra long, compared to width of sweater.",64009,3
64010,It's taken me awhile to review but I got this dress awhile back and I can't even wear it.,64010,3
64010,It's way too small even though I tried to order the largest size possible just in case it ran small.,64010,3
64010,I'm a big girl (size 22) so I know that going up in size is needed but even this made me feel like I was freaking huge.,64010,3
64010,"To top it off, I didn't even get the right color.",64010,3
64010,I ordered the blue/black & white dress but ended up receiving the Purple/Black & White one.,64010,3
64010,"Frankly, I've read that these dresses are hard to return and due to the low cost, I figured I might as well keep it and either I'll gift it to someone else or hope that I'll be able to make it work once I lose weight.",64010,3
64010,"Gave this three stars because if it had fit, I would've been happy.",64010,3
64010,The dress isn't bad it just isn't what I was hoping for.,64010,3
64011,"Quality and price are great, I love it and I recommend it.",64011,3
64012,"In most any shirt, I wear an XL.",64012,3
64012,Since this was a tshirt I thought I should order a size bigger.,64012,3
64012,I'm glad I did as it fits close.,64012,3
64012,The design is great!,64012,3
64013,I'm a true size 0.,64013,3
64013,The size 2 was a little tight on the waist but I could still move around in it.,64013,3
64013,The bust part of the dress is immensely loose on me (I'm a 34A) and I could probably fit a basketball in between the dress and my bust.,64013,3
64013,I think the dress is slightly unproportionate.,64013,3
64013,"For someone who is a 2, the bust should match the waist.",64013,3
64013,"Obviously, the dress is long on me so need to get it tailored.",64013,3
64013,"Other than that, it's true to the waist, off on the bust.",64013,3
64013,"The color is beautiful, the stitching where the sequins are on the bust came back a little ripped but its okay.",64013,3
64013,"It's a beautiful dress, I love the open back.",64013,3
64014,"The bag is too big for me,so i don't  use it now.",64014,3
64014,It  can hold almost 2 15 laptops.,64014,3
64015,I ordered a size up (M) based on what I read in the reviews.,64015,3
64015,I am petite (5'1; 110lbs) and I wish I had just ordered my regular size (S) because it is a tad bit big.,64015,3
64015,The silhouette isn't like the picture.,64015,3
64015,It's boxy and its not just because it's slightly big for me.,64015,3
64015,It would be boxy even if I ordered a small; it's just the way it's made.,64015,3
64015,"So in that way, this picture is a bit deceiving.",64015,3
64015,I was hoping for a comfy yet stylish/tailored for me.,64015,3
64015,This makes me look frumpy.,64015,3
64015,But I won't return because it really is super comfy.,64015,3
64015,The fabric isn't thick but it keeps me super warm and so it's also functional.,64015,3
64016,Snug fit maybe i should lose a few pounds.,64016,3
64017,Too small for toddler,64017,3
64018,Cheaply made you get what you made for.,64018,3
64019,Hard to read the funny saying.,64019,3
64019,Color is vibrant and it fits well.,64019,3
64019,"However the purpose of the shirt is to display the saying, and its hard to read due to the crinkled font.",64019,3
64020,But US medium runs short for me..,64020,3
64020,I'm 5 10 175lbs..,64020,3
64022,Pretty but was designed for women with short legs and wider hips.,64022,3
64023,please note - this is not an Adidas product.,64023,3
64024,This dress ended up shrinking after washing once or twice and drying.,64024,3
64024,"The seam under the breasts ended up coming to the middle of my breasts instead of below them, and I am not big-chested at all!",64024,3
64025,Updated after 1 week.,64025,3
64025,"I give it 3 stars now, compare to 1 star.",64025,3
64025,"After the suddent death after 2 days, i gently knock on it.",64025,3
64025,It came back alive.,64025,3
64025,I think the battery is lossen or something like that.,64025,3
64025,"PROS:
- Overall this is a nice watch with large display
- It's also light so movement with your hand is easy.",64025,3
64025,"- The design is sporty

CONS
- The viewing angle is limited, you have to twist your wrist at the right angle to see it
- IT'S DEAD AFTER TWO DAYS (i recevied it in sunday and in tuesday it's dead)",64025,3
64026,"I just didn't like the way it fit, to big.....",64026,3
64027,"For myself, it is too snug across my back, and sleeves too short.",64027,3
64027,"I don't think a larger size would be the answer, because then it might lose the slimlined shape that is shown in photo.",64027,3
64027,"If you do want to give it a try, I would go up 2 sizes.",64027,3
64027,Beautiful lines and lapel.....Pat ...Florida,64027,3
64028,"I thought these were going to be socks, when they showed up they were panty hose, like extremely thin and see thru.",64028,3
64028,Disappointed but not the end of the world.,64028,3
64029,It's not as long as it looks from the picture.,64029,3
64029,It's an average quality product.,64029,3
64030,Cute but snug and the fur sheds,64030,3
64031,i love the shirt itself.....but when i got it it had a lil hole in elbow :(,64031,3
64032,The product is of good quality.,64032,3
64032,I would recommend it to others,64032,3
64033,The poncho is pretty but so short!,64033,3
64033,A poncho to me should be long enough to cover your stomach but this one doesn't even do that!,64033,3
64033,That is a big disappointment to me!,64033,3
64034,Ordered this product for my daughter.,64034,3
64034,She loved it and the fit was correct.,64034,3
64034,"However, the material is cheap.",64034,3
64034,The stockings ripped while out trick-or-treating and the threads in the coat began to come out.,64034,3
64034,"However, it served its purpose to Halloween.",64034,3
64034,"For the price, I couldn't go wrong.",64034,3
64035,I thought this product was okay.,64035,3
64035,It wasn't what I expected though.,64035,3
64035,"They are cute in style, but useless while riding.",64035,3
64035,There is hardly any padding and the shorts are very thin.,64035,3
64035,"I really haveno use for them, but I will hang on to them anyway because theyare cute.",64035,3
64035,I would give this seller another opportunity to earn my dollar.,64035,3
64036,Snaps on front of costume came off immediately.,64036,3
64036,Poor stitching and the size ran small,64036,3
64037,"Very small, don't like the material, short,",64037,3
64038,Overall it looks ok.,64038,3
64038,I haven't worn it yet.,64038,3
64038,"The arms are very, very skinny.",64038,3
64038,I will probably add material to make it wearable.,64038,3
64039,When I received it in the mail the patterns a little too busy for me.,64039,3
64039,I have blankets from them and love the patterns.,64039,3
64039,For some reason it just looked a little too crazy on him,64039,3
64040,I always buy stride rite and paid more than I should have for these to get the right size but I'm a little disappointed with the quality.,64040,3
64040,After a few wears the fabric around the top of the sole is coming off and for what I paid I didn't expect that to happen after a few wears.,64040,3
64041,Very easily ripped but if you're careful you'll be fine.,64041,3
64042,The material was very thin which is both good and bad.,64042,3
64042,For a pregnant lady you want to stay cool.,64042,3
64042,Also trying to pull up shape wear that is so thin can be difficult.,64042,3
64044,So a while for it to arrive.,64044,3
64044,Great size but for whatever reason the color is off.,64044,3
64044,The black color of the car looks purple.,64044,3
64045,So I gave this product three stars because I do like it... as a shirt.,64045,3
64045,It is definitely way too short to be a dress but does look great with black skinny jeans.,64045,3
64045,The only other downside is that the chest area is super tight.,64045,3
64045,"I wear a 34C and even I have difficulty breathing sometimes in this ""dress.""",64045,3
64046,The material is not sheer and loose as depicted in the picture.,64046,3
64046,It is more of a Cotton/Spandex and way too tight and small.,64046,3
64047,The shirt came in and fit perfect around the waist but the part that draped around the shoulders was way too tight.,64047,3
64047,I'm not a big girl and followed the chart to pick the right size but it was still too tight.,64047,3
64048,The eyes were not as expected.,64048,3
64048,I didn't want people to be able to see my eyes through the fabric but they can.,64048,3
64048,The black around the eyes are wrinkly also.,64048,3
64048,it fits a bit snug.,64048,3
64048,The neck isn't long enough.,64048,3
64048,Overall worth the $10 but i would buy a different one next time.,64048,3
64049,I am a 12/Large and ordered my size.,64049,3
64049,It is not as pictured.,64049,3
64049,The middle section is not loose or baggy.,64049,3
64049,It fits more like a cat suit giving it more of a sexy look then casual.,64049,3
64049,The material is thick.,64049,3
64049,It is still a very nice one piece.,64049,3
64051,"Could be a cute dress, if he had fit.",64051,3
64053,It fits good around but I'm tall so it only comes up to right below my diaphragm and due to that it rolls down a little below my ribs.,64053,3
64054,T-shirt material is not good quality.,64054,3
64054,"It's Gildan brand t, can be bought at a Walmart for less than five dollars.",64054,3
64054,"The print itself is just okay, could be a little darker so that it stands out.",64054,3
64055,"It was somewhat small, but I was still able to fit it.",64055,3
64055,The chest part is really tight so make sure to get a larger size.,64055,3
64057,"Very very thin material, can see through it.",64057,3
64058,"However, the drivers license window was too tight.",64058,3
64058,"The first time my wife took her license out, three stitches popped.",64058,3
64058,The rest is fine and she enjoys it.,64058,3
64059,I thought it was a tight crop top it wasn't but I'm still pleased with this item,64059,3
64060,It is a super cute shirt.,64060,3
64060,"I am normally a medium, I ordered a large.",64060,3
64060,I definitely do not want to dry it.,64060,3
64060,It fits almost to perfect.,64060,3
64060,If I would order it again I would buy an xl.,64060,3
64061,Love the bottoms but the top was too big so I had to substitute the top with a plain black one and it worked out fine.,64061,3
64062,"3 stars because if this fit my body, I would have loved it.",64062,3
64062,It just didn't fit my body.,64062,3
64062,"I'm 5'3"", 130 pounds, and have a 34 DD chest.",64062,3
64062,Everything fit well except the chest.,64062,3
64062,The empire waist went across the middle of my boobs.,64062,3
64062,"When I pulled it down below my boobs where it belonged, it didn't cover my cleavage at all.",64062,3
64062,I could not have worn a bra and would have risked indecently exposing myself if I had worn it properly.,64062,3
64062,"I tried to put on a tank top, but it looked silly that way.",64062,3
64062,"Bummer because it is super cute, the color is nice, and it seems to be good quality.",64062,3
64063,"I loved the look and the price; however, I ordered a size and a half larger than what he is in (after reading reviews claiming they ran small) and it was still too small.",64063,3
64063,Sadly I had to return them for a refund as they were sold out of the 2 styles I chose in the size I needed (I think).,64063,3
64063,I'll check back though.,64063,3
64064,The frame is very light and if you put it in your purse it will bend.,64064,3
64065,necklace turned my neck green in two days.,64065,3
64065,so I cant wear it .,64065,3
64065,:(  Amendment 3/1/16.,64065,3
64065,The distributor contacted me to make things right immediately.,64065,3
64065,I was very impressed that they cared about my satisfaction and their action to fix my problem.,64065,3
64065,I hang it in my car now for a nice diffusor.,64065,3
64065,I will find another that has cord instead of a chain.,64065,3
64065,I am sure most people will love this and will not have a problem,64065,3
64066,could be more rhinestones,64066,3
64067,the bottom waist part of bathing suit is way to tight on hips.,64067,3
64067,The top part fits as expected.,64067,3
64068,"Not the beading I expected, really just sequined fabric.",64068,3
64069,"I like it, but would like it more if it was smaller.",64069,3
64069,Also wish it had a pocket.,64069,3
64070,loved this ring but it got caught on everything & having to keep adjusting it made it break :(,64070,3
64071,"It is a bit big on me, I ordered one before that was too small and had to give it to a friend.",64071,3
64071,They don't like to do returns instead they offered me 20 percent back and to give it away.,64071,3
64071,I was pretty upset but the coat is really cute so I tried again.,64071,3
64071,It's maybe a size too big but I like it.,64071,3
64071,However the quality of manufacture is pretty low.,64071,3
64071,I had a button that was way off I had to take it off and resew it in the right place.,64071,3
64071,Many stitches needed to be fixed on the pockets they looked like they were falling apart.,64071,3
64071,Basically I can see and it's a nice looking coat but the quality it low and ironically the coat that was small was better stitched.,64071,3
64071,So I guess they have a problem with bigger sizes or have a problem with QC.,64071,3
64072,It fit alright up top but the material is springing and slides up.,64072,3
64072,So the skirt is too short to wear like a dress wih out constantly having to yank it down.,64072,3
64073,It's really meant for a taller person.,64073,3
64073,The fabric was good and so was the style.,64073,3
64074,Just runs really small.,64074,3
64075,I purchased my actual size and it fits a little small.,64075,3
64075,I should of got a bigger size,64075,3
64076,It's a cute top but the hip area is way too small.,64076,3
64076,I will need to open up the side slits more so they'll fit on my waist/hips area.,64076,3
64076,Otherwise it's a good looking top and a good deal.,64076,3
64077,"The jeans are almost white, not pink as they look on the picture published on the internet.",64077,3
64078,"The shirt itself is high-quality, soft, and has a nice, feminine fit to it.",64078,3
64078,But I followed the sizing chart and it is way too small.,64078,3
64078,"Definitely order 1 or even 2 sizes up, depending on how you want it to fit.",64078,3
64078,"Also, when the shirt is on, the words wrap slightly too far on both sides, making it a little hard to read.",64078,3
64078,I think the design should be reduced in size a bit to make it more readable to others.,64078,3
64079,"The pin remover itself is pretty good quality,as it is all metal could scratch your watch on it.",64079,3
64079,"The free pins supplied are very soft, all 3 have bent after adjusting 3 watches and that is with applying only very slight force.",64079,3
64079,Is cheap for a reason.,64079,3
64080,The waist was small,64080,3
64081,The top was too big and the bottoms were a little small.,64081,3
64081,$ 20 is a lot when you can only wear the bottoms.,64081,3
64081,Would probably work for someone with at least a c cup (I ordered a small),64081,3
64082,I like it but it's to small,64082,3
64085,"A little tight for 5T, but my son still loved them because they were Paw Patrol.",64085,3
64086,Looked as shown but does run large.,64086,3
64087,"Not the best quality and material
Belt arived damaged!",64087,3
64088,"Loved these, they were big and cute.",64088,3
64088,But they broke pretty quickly?,64088,3
64088,"Or like the little screw came out and I...didn't have one of those tiny screw things to put it back so I just bought another pair which probably would have been the same price as the screwdriver thing, so.",64088,3
64089,It was okay but had to return.,64089,3
64090,"A bit flimsy, but it get's the job done.",64090,3
64091,Its soooo cute but its kind of small around my arms.,64091,3
64092,My birthstone is aquamrine.,64092,3
64092,So I really appreciate the variety in color in this ring.,64092,3
64092,It has the darker tone which you rarely see unless you are looking for it on purpose or a collector.,64092,3
64092,The dark aquamrine are more valuable than all.,64092,3
64092,So when I saw this ring I had to have it.,64092,3
64092,"Unfortunately, the sizing was not quite right and the ring itself was to overwhelming for my long thin finger.",64092,3
64092,All in all its a beautiful ring.,64092,3
64093,Picture looks better than the shirt does.,64093,3
64094,Zipper came off the left side,64094,3
64095,"its very cute, i ordered a size up because of other reviews (i normally wear a US Large so i ordered an XL) and it was too big.",64095,3
64095,but it still looked okay,64095,3
64096,The hearts are very brown and larger than I anticipated it is a cute top but really thin and cheaply made takes about 3 weeks to arrive.,64096,3
64097,"The quality is good, and I love the over all look but they're just a little too big, my husband says I look like I have bug eyes!",64097,3
64097,It's a shame they'd be perfect if the lenses weren't so big.,64097,3
64097,"I'm a pretty small female, with a small head, nearly child sized..",64097,3
64098,was hopping for more blue instead of gray smoky ones,64098,3
64099,Love the case i just ordered the wrong size ao cannot uae it.,64099,3
64100,This is too large and I plan to exchange it.,64100,3
64100,I like the looks of it though.,64100,3
64101,The yellow was not as bright as the picture lets on and the bracelet was broken when it came but the design is beautiful,64101,3
64102,"The necklace is beautiful and good quality, but the ashes will not go in.",64102,3
64102,"It comes with a small funnel to use, but the ashes won't go though it, either.",64102,3
64102,"Animal ashes are basically tiny bone fragments, and the opening is too small for them to go through, without crushing them up.",64102,3
64102,"Losing my baby was hard enough, I can't crush up his ashes to get them into this necklace.",64102,3
64103,"solid construction, nice feel.",64103,3
64103,we will see how long it lasts.,64103,3
64103,is as advertised - compact... holds credit cards and a few bills.,64103,3
64103,Husband has had wallet for about 2 months now...  unit probably won't last another month.,64103,3
64103,hinge is loose - frequently allows clasp to come open.,64103,3
64103,"my husband carry's it in his back pocket and when he sits down, i can hear it shift.",64103,3
64103,"Unit is ok if you carry it in your purse or jacket pocket, but not if you carry in your jeans.",64103,3
64103,I'm changing to 2 stars.,64103,3
64104,They fit well and snug on my foot but......I cant get past the fact that I feel the inside lining/ stitchin of the inside shoe on the toes.,64104,3
64104,"whether I adjust it so the stitching sits under or above my toes , it still feels uncomfortable.",64104,3
64104,"I have not even used the shoe yet but just from trying it on and walking around my house It felt a bit uncomfortable , so I cannot imagine wearing it for my 1 hour Samba Class.",64104,3
64104,I got these shoes to prevent my toes from ripping  .,64104,3
64104,"Samba class has slow to very fast foot movement and this was my purpose for buying these , to get support for the bottom of my foot and toes.",64104,3
64104,If anyone has any other suggestions please share.,64104,3
64106,this product the picture is better than the actual product the glow is just a dab of glow in the dark paint.,64106,3
64107,"Runs very small, particularly for maternity wear.",64107,3
64108,Could have lived without it,64108,3
64110,the ball is a little to small and doesn't pop in very snug,64110,3
64111,Nothing like the picture and too big,64111,3
64112,The first one I purchased had a broken clasp that would not lock.,64112,3
64112,Its a nice band ...,64112,3
64112,I have ordered another one and am returning the defective one.,64112,3
64112,We will see how the new one is...,64112,3
64113,These are leggings with fake pockets.,64113,3
64113,They are very comfortable.,64113,3
64113,Pockets are ink not stitched and do strech with your size.,64113,3
64114,the size chart is ok improper,64114,3
64115,They don't feel very well made.,64115,3
64115,Definitely have a cheap plastic-y feel to them.,64115,3
64115,"Unfortunately, they did not fit my head either, so those with wide heads beware.",64115,3
64116,The bag itself was well made - but it wasn't really what I was looking for once I got it.,64116,3
64118,FYI runs small & short,64118,3
64119,I had order the waist cincher in the nude color before in size medium and I like it much better.,64119,3
64119,the back panty part goes below the buttock so does not smash down on your  behind.,64119,3
64119,"The black one did not, maybe I should have ordered medium as it was a little too small.",64119,3
64119,I do like how it flattens my stomach.,64119,3
64120,Very nice but it doesn't last long.,64120,3
64121,The front pockets are too small,64121,3
64122,I see other reviews saying the same.,64122,3
64123,"Really cute dress, fit as expected but when it arrived it was damaged in some areas.",64123,3
64123,The thread where it's crocheted was torn so some holes were much bigger than others.,64123,3
64124,"I normally wear a size 8, I'm 130 pounds and 5'0 and I ordered the Medium in the Royal color.",64124,3
64124,"It fit okay, but the material is thinner and clings.",64124,3
64124,I like my clothes to be a little more flowy.,64124,3
64124,"I think if i would've sized up, it might've been okay.",64124,3
64124,The Royal color is not see-thru.,64124,3
64125,"Cute, but buttons are hard to get apart and tear easily from the lace",64125,3
64126,Not sure anyone would want to wear this as a dress but would probably be cute with leggings and boots.,64126,3
64126,The material is VERY thin and stiff,64126,3
64127,This is not as pretty in person.,64127,3
64127,It's quite cheap looking.,64127,3
64127,"I was going to give this as a gift, not after I saw it.",64127,3
64128,"I'll keep it, although the top doesn't look quite like the photo (but then, neither do I).",64128,3
64128,"The ties are quite long and when I tie them like the picture, they fall right under the bra so it looks like just a regular 2 piece.",64128,3
64128,I cut off the extra length and just tie it in front and that looks fine.,64128,3
64128,The fabric is thin and so the unlined bottom and light color shows little bulges - not attractive on me.,64128,3
64128,I wear it with a similar shaped black bottom and it looks good that way.,64128,3
64128,"The fabric is light weight enough that if you actually swim in this suit, the girls will likely flop out.",64128,3
64129,these are thin and small through the hips and thighs.,64129,3
64129,"Grant it, I am a ""women"" not a junior.",64129,3
64129,"I typically wear a size 10 jean, a L fit like thermal underwear only thinner and with a boot cut.",64129,3
64129,Not what I was looking for.,64129,3
64130,I liked the material and all.,64130,3
64131,"So it works great but is for C size or smaller, I wear a 32C/D and it fits the smaller C boob better than the D boob.",64131,3
64131,"That being said they hold well, clasp is lovely and packing really nice.",64131,3
64131,"Good for thicker material dresses on larger sized C/D women, the line is pretty thick where the bra edge is so you get some dimpling with thinner material.",64131,3
64131,If you're wearing a pattern it won't be noticeable though.,64131,3
64131,I got the Fetoo lace wing bra and IMO always order the largest size if you're not an A cup.,64131,3
64132,This is very soft and the color is very nice.,64132,3
64132,It was a bit too snug around the forehead and was not comfortable over several hours.,64132,3
64133,"Came early, but I must have gotten the plastic version because it is not leather.",64133,3
64134,I enjoy the thickness of these leggings but am disappointed that they don't go down to the ankle as pictured.,64134,3
64134,I am only 5'3'' and these are about mid calf on me.,64134,3
64135,Top was a bit loose in mid-section area and material was flimsy.,64135,3
64135,Shorts were too snug and short for my liking.,64135,3
64135,Will still wear it though.,64135,3
64136,"Its a very cute combo , but upsize by Atleast a year .",64136,3
64136,I got a 18month size for my 13 month old and its on the smaller side .,64136,3
64136,Definitely upsize by a year atleast.,64136,3
64137,It is a very delicate necklace almost to delicate.,64137,3
64137,Don't wear but just to church or special occasions the chin is thin and fearful of it breaking.,64137,3
64138,"Material is thick and it is streatchy, color is rich but very small, I would only recommend for a small person.",64138,3
64139,"The dress is adorable but it is thin, order a slip, it's not optional",64139,3
64140,"Fits a large child, way too big for 5 year old",64140,3
64141,"a bit short for me, my height is 5'10.",64141,3
64142,I absolutely LOVE the size and ease of this wallet.,64142,3
64142,The issue I have it is poorly made.,64142,3
64142,"The window pocket is lightly glued and the window very quickly pulled away from the leather, creating a gap at the base of the window.",64142,3
64143,I'm 5'10 and wear a size 10 or medium.,64143,3
64143,"I carry most of my weight in my thighs/buttocks and let's just say, these leggings are not for curvy women.",64143,3
64143,"Although I love the texture and feel of these leggings, it was hard to get them over my hips.",64143,3
64143,I wore them with a large silky t-shirt so I could pull it off but I had to keep pulling the leggings up every now and again.,64143,3
64143,If you're more of an small/slim build these leggings are perfect for you...my search continues...,64143,3
64144,Has a crookit fit to it but it works.,64144,3
64145,It's the price you pay for and does the job until my eyes catch something better.,64145,3
64146,Quality is good but small compared to my other sport coats.,64146,3
64147,I ended up returning these.,64147,3
64147,I was hoping my daughter would be able to wear them for Easter but they were too large.,64147,3
64147,I decided to return instead of exchange because they also seemed a bit wide (my daughter has tiny feet) and I didn't think they'd be comfortable even in her actual size.,64147,3
64147,They were also a bit clunky for dress shoes.,64147,3
64147,The color was also a bit closer to navy then the bright blue in the picture.,64147,3
64148,Top lil to big bottoms way to small,64148,3
64149,The Dress is beautiful!,64149,3
64149,Even though I was expecting a burgundy it sort of seems like a bright red to me.,64149,3
64149,The chest area is too bulky.,64149,3
64149,But it still fits fine.,64149,3
64150,this does not fit like it says in the description,64150,3
64151,"This is beautifully made, I bought it 2 sizes up though and it still wasn't quite what I wanted.",64151,3
64151,I like my clothes a little drapey on me though.,64151,3
64152,The top didn't seem to be plus size.,64152,3
64153,I got a outfit in a medium because I read a review that it runs small there is very little elastic in the outfit so after you put it on it loosens up.,64153,3
64153,will post pictures soon.,64153,3
64153,Great buy for the price.,64153,3
64153,"Thin material, and no elastic make the fit loosen too soon",64153,3
64154,Wondering why this was made in Thailand??????,64154,3
64154,Kept to give as gift but with some reservation that this is REALLY a Pandora bracelet.,64154,3
64154,Also seems a bit thinner than the Pandora bracelets I have seen.,64154,3
64155,"I wear an 8, and these were a little tight.",64155,3
64156,Had to return this item.,64156,3
64156,Quality was what I expected (as in not that great but ok for the price) as I have another pair of vinyl boots made by Pleaser.,64156,3
64156,"However if your calf is over 16inches, I do not recommend.",64156,3
64156,My calves are 17inch and I could get them laced up but the tongue is so narrow that I have to lace them extra tight so skin wouldn't show.,64156,3
64156,Not only was this uncomfortable but it was an obvious strain on the hooks and I doubt they would have lasted an hour.,64156,3
64156,I estimate a 16in calf would fit decently.,64156,3
64157,"This is a very nice belt but it has a serious flaw, the studs that hold the buckle onto the belt open very, very easily.",64157,3
64157,The color and quality of the belt are very good but the studs opening continually make this a truly frustrating belt to own.,64157,3
64158,But it is much bigger than a regular medium which I usually a.m.,64158,3
64159,fabric much thinner than i expected.,64159,3
64160,"I bought this shirt to wear with leggings, but it was too large that it looked shapeless.",64160,3
64160,"I was looking for something that I could wear as my pregnant belly gets larger, but this shirt was too baggy, that is just looked sloppy.",64160,3
64160,"However, the shipping was very fast and returning this product was a very easy transaction.",64160,3
64161,waited almost 4 months for a replacement.,64161,3
64161,them don't fit now my granddaughter grew.,64161,3
64162,"It was too tight, cute but too small.",64162,3
64163,The bathing suit was nice and it also came on time but I didn't receive the bow That was supposed to come with it.,64163,3
64165,The fabric was swooshy and reminded me of athletic material.,64165,3
64165,The neck was always bending.,64165,3
64165,Its perfect for sleeping or lounging only.,64165,3
64166,I was not super impressed with the dress.,64166,3
64166,It looks a bit sloppy on and it's see through.,64166,3
64166,"But, the price was low, hence the 3 stars as oppse to 1 or 2.",64166,3
64167,"They fit in size, but are a couple inches too long.",64167,3
64168,Dress is super cute.,64168,3
64168,I wear a 10 but wanted it to be loose so I ordered an extra large which should have had ample room.,64168,3
64168,Unfortunately it is so small that I had to give it to my daughter who wears a size 2.,64168,3
64168,The weird thing is that there is no tag on the actual dress to check the size.,64168,3
64168,Good quality but way too small.,64168,3
64169,"Fits okay, bt the pattern looks bad in person.",64169,3
64170,"I am 5""6 135 lbs.",64170,3
64170,I read that this product comes small so I ordered a size up and ordered a large.,64170,3
64170,"The fabric was ok, but the sleeves were extremely short.",64170,3
64170,If I knew the sleeves would be 4 inches longer I would probably have ordered this again.,64170,3
64171,Very low quality materials...thin polyester like a cheap Halloween costume.,64171,3
64172,I have to get use to this not so comfortable,64172,3
64173,these pants aren't see through like some of the other reviews mentioned- however they have the potential to be if you're larger and buy a size smaller than you realistically should.,64173,3
64173,They're a great fabric for running and they breathe well.,64173,3
64173,"I wish they were a little more reflective, and they did run a little big, I'm 5'3"" and 110LBS and ordered a small and they're a little large for my tastes.",64173,3
64173,"but you're not running to be stylish, so whatever, I like them fine enough.",64173,3
64174,"Quick shipping, thin material.",64174,3
64175,material is a little cheap and they are smaller than expected,64175,3
64176,It's a bit tight but very nice,64176,3
64178,"Too small, even in a large.",64178,3
64178,The fabric is completely see through but I suppose that's common for white fabric.,64178,3
64178,Better buy a slip.,64178,3
64178,The picture suggests better quality.,64178,3
64179,The material is soft and stretchy but one of my socks was shredded up on one side.,64179,3
64179,"I'm going to ""distress"" the other one and use them for a grunge look.",64179,3
64180,It's kinda small on my girlfriend especially the bottoms.. She got a medium and the chest part is a little bigger then hers but the bottoms were kinda small.,64180,3
64180,The suit is very pretty tho.,64180,3
64180,She still likes it don't get me wrong.,64180,3
64180,The material is really  comfy.,64180,3
64181,"It's a cute dress, yes.",64181,3
64181,But it's literally a piece of fabric that has a ribbon on the top so you can tie it together.,64181,3
64181,At least it's hymned.,64181,3
64181,You could make this yourself no problem.,64181,3
64181,"Very very sheer, you'll need something under it or stay out of the sun at all costs.",64181,3
64182,I ordered a Medium (which is what all my T-shirts are) and this was too small for me.,64182,3
64182,My girlfriend loves it and it fits her loosely but if you wear a medium I'd suggest going large.,64182,3
64183,Fit is cute but the fabric doesn't look like the picture.,64183,3
64184,"I love the way they feel but I received a pair for my birthday in a large, which is what I usually wear and it gives me a loose fit for sleeping but they are a it tight to be that comfortable.",64184,3
64184,So I ordered another pair with long sleeves in an extra large thinking that would be better but they too are too tight to look good but I'm wearing them even though the buttons gape.,64184,3
64184,In that way they are disappointing!!,64184,3
64184,"I love the colors, blue/green with short sleeves for my bday (L)  and dark wine color with long sleeves and button down the front in (XL).",64184,3
64185,"It's ok... kinda small and scratchy material and there are strings all over the inside and outside of shirt but for the price I paid, I like it ok.",64185,3
64185,It's no where near as long as it shows on the model and it's not loose.,64185,3
64185,It arrived in 3 weeks though which was quicker than expected.,64185,3
64186,Order a size larger than usual and you should be fine.,64186,3
64186,This fabric is very clingy.,64186,3
64188,It look like it was made funny not sewn properly in my opinion,64188,3
64189,"These are super cute and very comfortable, but...they're all polyester.",64189,3
64189,Totally agree with the five-star reviewers that these are super soft and the colors are incredibly vibrant.,64189,3
64189,"All-poly socks don't breathe well enough for me, so had to sadly send them back.",64189,3
64189,"I still pine for them each time I'm looking for low-cut socks, though.",64189,3
64189,"If these were even partially cotton, I'd order a dozen pairs and petition Amazon for a sixth star.",64189,3
64189,"If your feet aren't bothered by all-poly socks, treat this as a five star review.",64189,3
64189,"If you need your socks to absorb a little moisture and not make your feet sweat even worse, three stars it is.",64189,3
64190,I love this dress!,64190,3
64190,Its way shorter than I expected so I had to extend the bottom.,64190,3
64191,The dress fits fine but the skirt is bright yellow and the material under the lace is pale yellow.,64191,3
64191,Then there are these weird decorative buttons on the back...not my favorite.,64191,3
64192,I ordered a small and it is somewhat large and too long.,64192,3
64193,It ships from the UK so it takes about 2-3 weeks to arrive.,64193,3
64193,"Its a great design but like others said, it's VERY small.",64193,3
64193,"I wear an XL so I ordered the XXL, it's not only tight its VERY short.",64193,3
64193,It's about 4in shorter than most of my XL's.,64193,3
64193,The XXL is the size of large medium.,64193,3
64193,Guess Ill have to give this shirt away because I can't wear it.,64193,3
64194,Cute but I returned this because it was too tight.,64194,3
64194,Large fit like a small.,64194,3
64195,xl was more like xs....but very cute and soft,64195,3
64196,"Very cute, pocket is sideways but that's fine.",64196,3
64198,"The print on this shirt had cracks in it, I'm not sure if it was poor printing or the design but I don't like the way it looks.",64198,3
64199,Should have girls shirts with just Mickey on them.,64199,3
64200,Lenses kept popping out and finally one of the arms fell off and was lost after a few months.,64200,3
64201,The bow doesn't lay flat and they didn't even lay in a cute way.,64201,3
64201,I hardly used them.,64201,3
64202,Should get a size smaller.,64202,3
64203,The shape makes you look bigger and it's an odd shape.,64203,3
64204,Material was a little then.,64204,3
64204,Wish I wouldve went 1 size up so that I could actually wear it.,64204,3
64206,"3 stars only because the I'm 5', 140 lbs post-Partum and somehow these are very short on me.",64206,3
64206,Perhaps it's just my preference in style.,64206,3
64206,I like longer under shirts and sleep shirts.,64206,3
64206,I bought these for nighttime nursing when I'd want to wear pj pants versus a nursing gown.,64206,3
64206,Most people post baby don't want a mid-drift shirt.,64206,3
64207,They are cute but the 4t's I ordered for my granddaughter are way too long for her.,64207,3
64207,"Hopefully, they will shrink some since they are 100% cotton.",64207,3
64208,I actually love this shirt.,64208,3
64208,I did listen to reviews and ordered  a crazy size but the truth is it totally shrunk after a wash.,64208,3
64208,I just roll the sleeves up now when I wear it.,64208,3
64208,It's light & flow & good summer shirt.,64208,3
64208,.. just hang dry,64208,3
64209,"When I opened the package and saw the dress and how well it was sewn, I was pleasantly surprised.",64209,3
64209,All gems and sequined beautifully placed and seen.,64209,3
64209,"However, I don't know what they were thinking when the midsection the crosses over the breaded area was completely left open.",64209,3
64209,"How would I wear a dress the completely exposed my boobs,  I was very disappointed because I can't.",64209,3
64209,The company so graciously gave me a 30 dollar refund and let me keep the dress I thought that was fair.,64209,3
64209,I will take it to a seamstress and see if she can close the front.,64209,3
64209,"Also, there's a little unevenness in the bra area.",64209,3
64209,Not sure what to do with that either.,64209,3
64209,I would recommend For women with small boobs.,64209,3
64210,Very nice and comfortable tanks but they run small,64210,3
64211,The belt ripped off...,64211,3
64211,Otherwise it was cool.,64211,3
64212,"There is puckering on the front seam, but it was very cheaply priced, so I shouldn't complain.",64212,3
64213,It was smaller than I expected and the cross can easily slip through the infinity circles.,64213,3
64214,Cute gift gave it to my friend but the chain broke the next day,64214,3
64215,I'm a little disappointed it doesn't look as great as its pictured the pants fits great I like them but the top is too big if you have large size beast it makes you look disformed b cuz the top is much larger.,64215,3
64215,I wear a size 16 & 40 D bra I bought xl and it fits good.,64215,3
64215,I just wish the top wasn't so large.,64215,3
64216,They hurt but sooo pretty,64216,3
64217,The poof is smashed,64217,3
64218,Very cute but too small for me.,64218,3
64218,Seller took care of the problem and was very nice about it.,64218,3
64218,My friend ordered one and hers was also smaller than expected.,64218,3
64218,Just be sure to order 2 sizes above your normal size and you'll be very happy with it!,64218,3
64219,It is pretty but unfortunately not very versatile for different body types..,64219,3
64219,"Went by the sizing chart but it was still very baggy around the waist,  doesn't taper at all like in the picture (unless you have it tailored)  and I am very tall so the waist-line (top of the skirt)  actually started well above my belly button.",64219,3
64219,"I don't mind high waisted skirts but it just looked all wrong,  like I was wearing a baggy kids dress.",64219,3
64219,:( I gave it to a friend.,64219,3
64220,The perfect pajama material with a little give but still warm.,64220,3
64220,I have three boys and these definitely look like girl pajamas.,64220,3
64220,The red is orange... not red.,64220,3
64220,"I ordered a 7-8 for my son who wears size 7 clothes, size 5-6 for my son who wears size 5 clothes, and size 2-3 from my son who wears size 3T.",64220,3
64220,All of them were too big.,64220,3
64221,Cute .. Too small,64221,3
64222,Purse was smaller then I expected.,64222,3
64222,It's for someone who don't carry a lot,64222,3
64223,Somewhat large around calf.,64223,3
64223,No way to tighten and the front would move to the side and I had to keep turning to front.,64223,3
64223,Like style and color.,64223,3
64224,I am saying Ok only because I had a pair of ear muffs before these and they are smaller in size.,64224,3
64224,You can't tell how big these are in photos.,64224,3
64224,"Now that said, these are very soft, they cover a larger area.",64224,3
64224,They cover all of the ear area plus some.,64224,3
64224,I live in Atlanta so our temps aren't all that harsh.,64224,3
64224,I think these would do really well in northern climates.,64224,3
64224,"I am still keeping them, though.",64224,3
64225,"The sizing fits like a large instead of xl, but it will work.",64225,3
64226,"This pair did not fit, same size as my other pair so don't know why this pair didn't fit but the other one did...",64226,3
64227,The fabric and color of this dress looks really ugly.,64227,3
64227,The only positives are the size chart and finishes dress well.,64227,3
64228,"These boots look great and they are comfortable to wear, however the shaft of the boot is pretty narrow.",64228,3
64228,I don't think I have large calves but it's still hard to zip up.,64228,3
64228,"Because of this, the zipper pull on the left boot is starting to break.",64228,3
64228,I guess I shouldn't be surprised since they were so cheap.,64228,3
64229,I'm 5'10 with thick thighs and the reviews showed they would fit.,64229,3
64229,So I ordered and when they got here I felt ripped off.,64229,3
64229,they're just at knee high!,64229,3
64230,Coat is very nice in quality the arms are short and coat runs small..,64230,3
64231,fit very funny>>>> although the seller was nice enough to compensate and great to work with.,64231,3
64232,"Bodice wasn't like the picture, still a cute dress though.",64232,3
64234,"It is a little cheap seeming, but ut was cheap after all.",64234,3
64234,Fits ok and I'm 5 ft tall n weigh 130lbs.,64234,3
64234,My bf likes it a lot.,64234,3
64235,I wasn't overly impressed with this.,64235,3
64235,It wasn't horrible (both my husband and daughter liked it on me) but I didn't like it.,64235,3
64235,"First, the one I got, the ties weren't woven through the crocheted part evenly so the ties were about an inch off in distance where they came together in the front.",64235,3
64235,I did like how you can tighten/loosen the ties to give a custom look.,64235,3
64235,"I am not big on ""ties"" on my suits and such - simply too messy if sand gets in them and the parts dangling get caught up on everything.",64235,3
64235,The material is very sheer and lightweight - which I like for a cover-up.,64235,3
64235,I am very short so this was longer on me than I would prefer (just above my knee) and looked like a sheer dress instead of a cover up (IMO).,64235,3
64235,"I normally wear a 34D, size 2 pants and it had plenty of room all the way around.",64235,3
64235,"For a one size fits most, it definitely would work for a wide variety of body types.",64235,3
64235,"If there wasn't another one I liked better, I probably would be keeping this.",64235,3
64236,"love the pattern, but the metal tone color is wearing off badly, i will still use it, but it looks awful",64236,3
64237,Really cut but order it two sizes large than you need.,64237,3
64237,This is too small for me.,64237,3
64238,Nice product- softness is comparable to LuluRoe.,64238,3
64238,"Unsure of how it washes yet, fits a bit small.",64238,3
64239,"I really like it, but it's too small.",64239,3
64239,I ordered the extra large and it doesn't even fit around my chest.,64239,3
64239,"Also, WAYYYYY too short.",64239,3
64240,This item is pretty much exactly a pictured.,64240,3
64240,The finish is a gun metal grey & it the item feels solid.,64240,3
64240,"Only giving 3 stars, bc you definitely need to pay attention to the dimensions here.",64240,3
64240,"The item is was much smaller then expected from the preview pictures & the 2 pins are really unnecessary, 1 would have done nicely.",64240,3
64241,Came unstitched easily and had a strange smell upon arrival.,64241,3
64242,This shirt fits very weird and runs  very big.,64242,3
64243,I'm currently a 40A.,64243,3
64243,Finding a bra in that size that fits shallow breasts has become the Impossible Dream.,64243,3
64243,"This bra is wearable and doesn't gap horribly, it's a good price, but it has enough shortcomings that I will not buy another one.",64243,3
64243,"The straps are too short to cross in the back, which is what I wanted, because my shoulders slope and consequently my bra straps fall down.",64243,3
64243,I wouldn't want to wear it as a strapless bra because it doesn't have any extra stiffening or gripper elastic at the sides.,64243,3
64243,It's also so stretchy that I develop quad boobs--the bra slips up when I raise my arms and it stays there.,64243,3
64243,And it has a small sewing flaw.,64243,3
64244,Love the vibrant colours but the shirt isn't bias cut for a woman's body as advertised.,64244,3
64244,It's just straight down.,64244,3
64244,FYI to any potential buyers.,64244,3
64244,Wish it really was a women's cut though.,64244,3
64245,"This backpack is larger than expected, it is not for a kindergartener size kid.",64245,3
64246,"the bracelet it's self is nice, but the clasp won't stay closed , spent more time picking it up off the floor than wearing it.",64246,3
64246,ended up putting a small piece of black duck tape around the clasp to keep it closed.,64246,3
64247,"Not quite as pictured, stones are smaller and opal more glass then opal",64247,3
64248,Super cute but I bought it for my treguas (like the picture shows) but the screw is on the back and I couldn't get it in my ear to screw it on.,64248,3
64249,"Super cute, but some rhinestones were missing when I received.",64249,3
64249,Order a half bigger as they run small.,64249,3
64249,They seem comfortable but I have not worn all day as weather not warm enough yet.,64249,3
64250,I bought it for my friend.,64250,3
64250,I was not happy with the color.,64250,3
64250,She sent me a picture and it was so different than the picture here.,64250,3
64250,Much much lighter shade of 'red' - you could probably call it vermilion or brick or coral or a shade somewhere there,64250,3
64251,I have very small hands and the triangle portion of the bracelet sits somewhere about 3 inches below from my wrist because the chain is so long.,64251,3
64251,Also triangle is smaller than expected.,64251,3
64251,I like the adjustable ring though.,64251,3
64251,I'll probably take some pliers and remove a few links of the chain so it's not so long.,64251,3
64252,I bought this product a few weeks ago to wear on vacation .,64252,3
64252,Its very cute and looks nice on but I began noticing that it has started to discolor.,64252,3
64252,I don't know if it is because I wore it in the ocean but I know I habe worm other belly rings and this has not occurred so it was disappointing.,64252,3
64252,"I recommend wearing it for the occasion and then remove,  rinse, drying and put it away in order to preserve color.",64252,3
64252,Wish I could continue wearing it.,64252,3
64253,"XXL was too small - but should have fit a ""little better"" than it did.",64253,3
64253,I was disappointed with the fabric.,64253,3
64253,Had a rough feel.,64253,3
64254,"Prettier than expected but w/ being a stretchy material I would order size smaller plus if ur in the shorter side, I would look into getting something else all together...",64254,3
64254,But is is a lovely dress,64254,3
64256,"Very see through, I'm 5""8 and with heels it still dragged the floor, I think I swept my entire apartment",64256,3
64257,Bottom wears out too soon.,64257,3
64257,"I use it for water aerobics & jacuzzi about 3x per week, but have had to replace 3 times is 7 months.",64257,3
64257,The aquabelle top lasted the whole six months.,64257,3
64258,The material is a little bit thin such as to make me a little bit self conscious...but everyone else thinks it is flattering.,64258,3
64259,"Quality is good, but it is not a sweater jacket it is cotton and not as long as photos show.",64259,3
64259,Color is not as it appears on the website.,64259,3
64259,"So I was a little disappointed, but over all looking forward to sporting it off this Winter.",64259,3
64259,I posted a picture below for you to see to know.,64259,3
64259,I would buy from them again.,64259,3
64260,"I love it, I thought it was larger, but I can work with it!",64260,3
64261,Bought this about a month ago.,64261,3
64261,It did not take long to stretch out.,64261,3
64261,I bought the smallest size because of the reviews.,64261,3
64261,I do waist training with a 22 corset every other day.,64261,3
64261,"By the time I get to the cincher on my non-corset days, it is too big.",64261,3
64261,I'm not sure if the materials have stretched out from pulling it closed or what.,64261,3
64261,I am going to try different brands.,64261,3
64262,Stitching and thread termination were not what I would expect.,64262,3
64262,"However, for the price, it was satisfactory.",64262,3
64262,We'll see how long it stays together.,64262,3
64265,Dress fit to snug.,64265,3
64265,"Also, front openings was to revealing.",64265,3
64266,Runs small and very clingy fabric.,64266,3
64267,They are beautiful and fit perfectly but have left green residue on the inside of my nose from wearing the same ring for 4 days straight.,64267,3
64267,I don't know if I actually believe that the post is stainless steel and I hope my nose doesn't become infected.,64267,3
64268,ordered the large still too small.,64268,3
64268,I'm 32F/34DDD with a big booty and it didn't fit,64268,3
64271,Runs large- my 12 month old had no chance of fitting into these for a while.,64271,3
64271,"In fact, the flat bottom does not have any grip or texture to prevent slipping.",64271,3
64271,We have tile and hardwood and she will not be able to use these at home.,64271,3
64271,But they will be cute for out running errands.,64271,3
64272,These tights fit me fine.,64272,3
64272,"I am 4'10"" and 92 pounds.",64272,3
64272,They seem to be of fine quality however they are not fleece.,64272,3
64272,They are nothing more than regular tights.,64272,3
64272,They are solid and not see through.,64272,3
64272,I do not see these as being warm.,64272,3
64272,They are no different than any pair of regular tights you could purchase anywhere.,64272,3
64272,"These can not be worn with a long sweater or tunic or a short dress, they are much too thin.",64272,3
64273,It is a cute top but a bit small around my chest and arms.,64273,3
64273,I am normally a medium may have fit better in a large.,64273,3
64274,No excellent but is good.,64274,3
64274,I'm 5'' and the long was good.,64274,3
64276,The material is like for a cosplay.,64276,3
64276,I guess you get what you payed for,64276,3
64277,I had been buying these in black from another seller and decided to give color a try.,64277,3
64277,These are not the same quality as the black ones and cost more than double the price.,64277,3
64277,I have worn each of them maybe once.,64277,3
64277,I bought Hot Pink and Light Purple.,64277,3
64278,"I like the shirt, but it was much smaller than I anticipated.",64278,3
64278,I recommend you buy it a size larger than what you normally wear.,64278,3
64279,very small fit and had to return,64279,3
64280,"Really cute tank, fits a little small",64280,3
64281,a little more room up front would be nice,64281,3
64282,fabric edges are not finished as I expected.,64282,3
64283,So I know it's really hard to buy a bathing suit online...... but I read the reviews and took a chance.....,64283,3
64283,I'm petite( 5ft 112 lbs ) with a 36c-  so I purchased the medium---- the top ran small- and the bottoms were too big!,64283,3
64283,I wish they seller would let you mix and match the sizes!,64283,3
64283,so bummed because the suit is really cute!,64283,3
64284,There were strings hanging from the shirt when I took it from the package.,64284,3
64284,The quality of the shirt looks much nicer in the picture.,64284,3
64284,"FYI, the pocket and bow are black (I thought it was navy); not the seller's fault, but I figured I share that in case anyone else thought it was navy.",64284,3
64286,"Blouse color is great, will reorder in larger size",64286,3
64288,It's not bad for the price but the top strand does not look like the picture.,64288,3
64288,The chain it's self is a little thicker than I imagined.,64288,3
64289,Got kinda tight but I'm large up top.,64289,3
64289,It was ripped down the seam when I received it.,64289,3
64290,I loved this product when I first put it on.,64290,3
64290,It held up wonderfully throughout the initial stages of the ball I attended.,64290,3
64290,"However, as the evening wore on, the elastic of the garter began to stretch and I found that I finally had to take the garter off.",64290,3
64290,"Otherwise, it would have slid down to my ankle.",64290,3
64290,There's no way to tighten the garter as the Velcro was at the end when I first attached it.,64290,3
64290,I would suggest ordering a size smaller as the garter stretches.,64290,3
64290,I was only able to get one wear out of this and I really liked it at the beginning of the evening.,64290,3
64290,"It held my room key, my phone, money, a phone charger, lipstick, and a mirror.",64290,3
64291,Meh - I gave this to someone who loved it..... the beads looked cheap to me.,64291,3
64292,fading after washing-by hand-three times-but it was cheap.,64292,3
64293,doesn't fit my big ass thighs but is good,64293,3
64294,I do not like the synthetic fabrid,64294,3
64295,not made like the picture at all,64295,3
64298,"I will have to cut off about 5"" and hem these (I'm 5' 4"") and they are very thin but I plan to wear them over tights so they will be okay.",64298,3
64298,Had a hard time finding a dark brown palazzo pants so I'll keep them,64298,3
64299,"The leggings fit as expected however they do not accommodate my waist and they have a tendency to fall down, yes fall down while I am working out.",64299,3
64299,I am unable to do any kind of aerobic exercise while wearing these leggings.,64299,3
64300,i ordered this and the length is shorter and the cut is really really low i had to wear a sports bra under it just to cover up my bra.,64300,3
64301,Torso barely fit to snap.,64301,3
64302,I purchased these shoes based on a review that recommended them for people who stood on their feet all day.,64302,3
64302,"After just two hours standing at a cash register, my feet were hurting significantly.",64302,3
64302,"The arch support is good and the shoes appear to be very well constructed, but I need cushioning in the ball of my foot, and these just didn't have enough.",64302,3
64303,Looks exactly like this!,64303,3
64303,"However, the material is flismy.",64303,3
64303,Its the type where it'll get really statically to your body.,64303,3
64303,Short are super short!,64303,3
64303,Not butt cheek showing though (I'm 5'0'').,64303,3
64304,"The material is rough, steamed it and it is still on the stiff side but for the price of standard veils this was a good deal!",64304,3
64305,"Ok quality but it was super cheap so it was better than expected, I would recommend getting a hot glue gun to reglue feathers if they fall out (they did for us but it wasn't a big deal)",64305,3
64306,The quality wasn't as good as it looked on the picture,64306,3
64307,Fit nicely but quality was not as excepted.,64307,3
64308,I agree with the other reviewer: top was too big and bottom too small.,64308,3
64308,I'm 5'2/110/34B and I ordered a small.,64308,3
64308,The bottom feels like an XS and is a little too tight.,64308,3
64308,The top feels more like a 36B and is too loose.,64308,3
64308,"So adorable, wish it fit better.",64308,3
64309,Way to small but good quality,64309,3
64310,It's very cute but the bow makes it fall forward and awkwardly exposes the post.,64310,3
64310,"It's smaller than I thought, but still looks nice when it sits correctly.",64310,3
64310,But sometime it gets caught on things--this is not a problem with other belly button rings I have.,64310,3
64311,It's hard to tell from the photo but there is a lot of nude colored mesh on the top of this dress where the applique is.,64311,3
64311,I didn't like the look of this and have returned the dress',64311,3
64312,I compared these to both my very expensive sunglasses and my drugstore sunglasses and was not impressed 4  the price .,64312,3
64312,"I was hoping they would make  things a little clearer, more defined.",64312,3
64312,Actually was sorry I didn't send them back,64312,3
64313,Adorable design but volume and power buttons nearly impossible to find.,64313,3
64314,Definitely get a size or two up from what you are originally,64314,3
64315,"I wouldn't say these are the softest or most comfortable wrist warmers I've ever had, but they were okay.",64315,3
64315,"They do keep them warm I guess, but they're a tiny bit scratchy, in my opinion.",64315,3
64315,I would possibly get them again.,64315,3
64316,"While the belt itself is of quite high quality, it is a stretch to say it's appropriate as a ample amount of belt for a 36"" waist.",64316,3
64316,"I can wear it, but only about 3/4"" ends up making it through the buckle.",64316,3
64316,Buyer  be vigilant relative to the ACTUAL size of this belt.,64316,3
64317,"Wish it was a tad longer, however, it cute, will keep.",64317,3
64317,I ordered a large and I am a medium size.,64317,3
64317,So I suggest order up a size.,64317,3
64318,would have to wear leggings with or capris,64318,3
64319,I ordered the bleach blonde and it is more of a light ashy blonde it doesn't match my hair well enough to use.,64319,3
64319,As far as quality it feels nice and looks okay but you can tell it's fake.,64319,3
64319,Nit quite as girly as I had hoped but it does have a nice little bit of curl to it.,64319,3
64319,For this price range I guess it's okay if you can get a color that actually matches your hair.,64319,3
64319,Mine also had a flaw where some of the hair was cut very short and it just stuck straight out of the clip.,64319,3
64319,If I wanted to use that I could just trim that part lower though and you wouldn't notice it.,64319,3
64319,Decided not to return it because the price was so cheap and I change my hair color often so I may end up with that hair color one day.,64319,3
64320,My granddaughter loves the dress.,64320,3
64320,It does run on the small size so I ordered one size larger than she wears.,64320,3
64320,It was snug but she wears it anyway because she loves the dress.,64320,3
64320,The dresses do run on the small size.,64320,3
64321,"They are too small, material is not as thick as I thought either but its ok....",64321,3
64322,"This scarf is great quality, but the color is NOT as pictured.",64322,3
64322,I ordered color 27 (the lavender/pale purple) and it's actually closer to a darker pink/mauve (photo attached).,64322,3
64322,"I decided to keep the scarf instead of returning it because I don't mind the color, but sharing my experience for those considering ordering purple.",64322,3
64323,I love the color I love the neckline but there sure it just seems too large around the body could have been tighter fit,64323,3
64324,"the bottom fit perfect, but my top is small.",64324,3
64324,"For it to be an XL, the top was for someone with small breast.",64324,3
64324,but i still love the material and the bathing suit.,64324,3
64325,"Horrible, the fit was so small, I don't think anyone's nipples are that small.",64325,3
64325,"Product itself looked decent, however, check measurements before purchase.",64325,3
64326,"I bought these shoes for work
They're not as comfortable as the others I've bought
Wasn't true to size",64326,3
64327,The outfit does not look exactly as it does in the photo.,64327,3
64327,I looked at the costume at a local retailer and did not buy it because of the differences from the photo on the package and the actual costume.,64327,3
64327,The shirt is not a cropped t-shirt.,64327,3
64327,It hangs well below the waistband.,64327,3
64327,This is an issue if you are planning to attach all of the Harley Quinn tattoos and want them seen since one goes at the belly button.,64327,3
64327,"Also, the diamond ""belt buckle""  is much larger than the one in the photo.",64327,3
64327,"Again, somewhat hiding the tattoo.",64327,3
64327,The shorts are longer than pictured and this will also change the placement of the tattoos.,64327,3
64327,I am going to modify the costume but shouldn't have to.,64327,3
64327,It should be as is pictured.,64327,3
64328,Fits a little small,64328,3
64329,Very nice but size wise runs small.,64329,3
64330,Material is not real thick,64330,3
64331,"The baby shirt came as expected, with the ""Sweet Child o Mine"" on it.",64331,3
64331,However it was a few days late so I didn't have it on the day I needed it (baby shower),64331,3
64332,Can't really wear it out.,64332,3
64332,Doesn't offer support nor does it look like the photos.,64332,3
64333,It's nice and everything I ordered but I think that the charms are a little too big and the clasp is cheap.,64333,3
64335,"it's just a headband with a little bit of lace covering, it doesn't cover as much of the face as it shows in the picture.",64335,3
64336,Seams came apart after several washings,64336,3
64337,"It's an ""ok"" dress.",64337,3
64337,"I am 5'7"" n 170lbs and lenght was perfect.",64337,3
64337,"I got many compliments, however, it doesn't fit too comfortable around the breast area it kept moving and at times I was showing side breast.",64337,3
64337,The gold lacing was also a bit different than pic.,64337,3
64339,I have this bracelet in different metals from a couple of different company's and on this one the clasp will not stay closed.,64339,3
64339,It's good for the price but beware that the clasp is not strong it has fell off my arm a couple of times.,64339,3
64340,This item runs very small.,64340,3
64341,"I love how soft these slippers are and the nice long height, but being a size 6--and I can even wear some 6-1/2s--the small/medium is HUGE.",64341,3
64341,Too huge for comfort because my feet slide around in them and even fall half off my feet.,64341,3
64341,Haven't had a reason to wash them yet to see how they hold up but will update when I do.,64341,3
64341,"Regretfully, I'm pretty disappointed with these only for the size.",64341,3
64341,Extra smalls would have been nice.,64341,3
64341,I wear a thick pair of socks in them.,64341,3
64341,They're still too big but it's a little better.,64341,3
64342,"The fascinator itself is actually pretty great, but it was completely flattened from storage and/or shipping.",64342,3
64343,The detail on the back is sewn on wrong and makes the dress look cheap.,64343,3
64343,"Otherwise, it fits nice but the material bunches and gets weird lint balls on it after a night of dancing.",64343,3
64343,You get what you get for $100,64343,3
64344,Top of sock should be black.,64344,3
64344,Sock is a little big.,64344,3
64344,No other sizes to choose from.,64344,3
64345,"This was really disappointing because I love the texture of the material, the colors and design!",64345,3
64345,"Unfortunately, the waistband is completely useless, I can't even wear these with a sweater dress, let alone to dance (work out in).",64345,3
64345,This may not be an issue if your derriere doesn't occupy the majority of the garment.,64345,3
64345,"On the upside, the moment you start to sweat, the material instantly sticks to your skin.",64345,3
64345,So there is that.,64345,3
64346,"Frame too small, even for 9 year old.",64346,3
64347,Looks a lot smaller than the picture but good for the price,64347,3
64349,A bit to small for my everyday use.,64349,3
64350,I order size M .,64350,3
64350,I got L !,64350,3
64350,I'm not happy with this .,64350,3
64350,I order in Augustus and the package arrived today !,64350,3
64351,the bracelet its self is really good and good quality for the price but if you have a smaller wrist then its not going to fit well.,64351,3
64352,"Bought for my expecting wife and she likes them, but she says it's nothing to wear out.",64352,3
64355,XL ladies runs small!,64355,3
64355,"If you have larger breasts, this probably won't work.",64355,3
64356,"It looks cute, but the Small was way too tight for my daughter, based on the sizing chart.",64356,3
64356,"She's about a size 3, but I would have had to get the equivalent of a size 6-8 for it to have fit properly.",64356,3
64357,"its too tight, i gifted it to someone else, its not stretchy so get a bigger size than what you really are.",64357,3
64357,"However the piece is absolutely beautiful and very well made, I would order from this seller again keeping in mind it runs a tad small :)",64357,3
64358,good quality and length but super tight across the shoulders and chest.,64358,3
64358,Doubly challenging for a nursing top!,64358,3
64359,"I have an average width size 8 foot but the toe strap seems too close to the toe, like it should be more around the balls of your feet.",64359,3
64359,But maybe that's just the way they fit me.,64359,3
64359,There are better sandals for this price point in my opinion.,64359,3
64360,It is a lot tighter around the chest area than expected so keep that in mind if you are more than a B-cup.,64360,3
64361,I bought this as a daily deal because I thought the emerald green color was gorgeous.,64361,3
64361,When it arrived I was disappointed because the shirt was more of a lighter lime green color rather than the rich bold green I expected.,64361,3
64361,It fits alright but is a little bit on the short side for me (I'm only 5ft 6) so that's usually not an issue for me.,64361,3
64361,I will be returning this item for a refund.,64361,3
64362,The quality of this purse is ok.,64362,3
64362,It does look like the picture but the chain was fading on some links when I received it.,64362,3
64363,wash out too fast,64363,3
64364,The pants bottom was too tight while all the other parts fit perfectly,64364,3
64365,The pear is beautiful but it's so small.,64365,3
64365,And the chain is so thin.,64365,3
64365,I think it didn't worth the price.,64365,3
64366,Perfect for dinner on vacation.,64366,3
64367,"First of all, this took a long time to get here.",64367,3
64367,"I was fine with a two week shipment, but it ended up taking a whole month.",64367,3
64367,It turns out darker than the picture.,64367,3
64367,It does fit my blaze but I've worn it for 3 days and already the edges of the band are cracking and falling off.,64367,3
64370,A lot longer than I expected,64370,3
64372,This bag is very small and looks bad in person.,64372,3
64372,Looks more plastic like in person and I have no use for it.,64372,3
64372,Not exactly what I imagined.,64372,3
64373,Except one came darker than the other.,64373,3
64373,They were too big for my head and bc they are heavy they just kept falling forward.,64373,3
64373,But they were cute,64373,3
64374,Very nice wide black leather belt.,64374,3
64374,"My only issue with it may be my mistake:  I thought I was ordering a 40-inch belt, and this one is almost--but not quite--too short.",64374,3
64374,Another inch would be perfect.,64374,3
64375,"A little bit higher waisted than I expected, and runs a little bit small.",64375,3
64376,There is a thread flaw towards the middle.,64376,3
64376,It is very visible.,64376,3
64376,"I was just upset about that, other than that it is nice material.",64376,3
64377,but tarnishing on it after awhile.,64377,3
64377,"Overall very nice ring,too bad for it changing colors,Cuz I really loved this ring.",64377,3
64378,Will blow off in a second.,64378,3
64379,Too much farbric- doesn't fit quite right.,64379,3
64380,"Cheap metal and materials used, but really wanted a Hamsa anklet and the price was right.",64380,3
64381,"Way smaller than I expected, but it's Snoopy and I am a fan...",64381,3
64382,This is a really beautiful piece of jewelry.,64382,3
64382,"I really liked it, but the wing broke from the heart and I just haven't had time to see what to do to fix it.",64382,3
64383,"The earrings themsekves are great, but buy extra backs because these ones fall off right away!",64383,3
64385,seems to be a little larger than advertised.,64385,3
64385,Maybe after a few washes it will shrink a bit.,64385,3
64386,"I bought these hoping they would really be ""no show"".",64386,3
64386,For lace ups and maybe a quarter of my slip-ons they are!,64386,3
64386,"For the other 75% of my loafers they are decidedly ""show"".",64386,3
64387,"It fits really well, it's comfortable.",64387,3
64387,My only issue is it leaks at the seams and the padding part should be a bit longer in the front...,64387,3
64388,I bought these for the colors.,64388,3
64388,"On that, I'm not disappointed.",64388,3
64388,"But, I ordinarily buy XL because I like my pants a little looser.",64388,3
64388,I actually wear a large.,64388,3
64388,"I purchased 3 pairs, all XL.",64388,3
64388,The first pair was tight but the length was perfect.,64388,3
64388,"The second pair was also tight, but they were too long.",64388,3
64388,The third pair is much tighter and shorter still.,64388,3
64388,"I would call these leggings, not pants, that fit looser from the knee down.",64388,3
64388,My concern is the seams will pull apart because of the stretch required to pour myself into them.,64388,3
64388,The waist is not comfortable.,64388,3
64388,"I have been trying to loose weight, so I'm thinking they'll be more comfortable when I get down 10 pound.",64388,3
64388,"The colors are great, but the fit is variable.",64388,3
64388,"3 pairs, all the same size, should be the same length and fit.",64388,3
64388,"The price is OK, but I've gotten more quality for the same money on Amazon in the past.",64388,3
64389,good quality but a litte big,64389,3
64390,"I was a little skeptical about flying with an action packer again, as a regualar tsa lock slides through the lock hole on the handles and my lid popped off.",64390,3
64390,But this is a good alternative.,64390,3
64390,"It fits around the 24 gallon action packer by rubbermaid, which is the exact diminsions of largest luggage hard case.",64390,3
64390,I can take chritmas presents without the worry they will get damage in transport.,64390,3
64390,"I will update my star rating after my trip, as the buckles are made of plastic and im not sure how they will hold up on a long flight.",64390,3
64390,But the bottom line is the luggage stap is fully adjustable!,64390,3
64390,The directions are literally about as good as ikea instructions but i figured it out just by looking at the images.,64390,3
64390,The straps themselves appear durable and they do not slide around on the plastic.,64390,3
64390,Which will definetely keep the lid and contents secure.,64390,3
64390,The straps CAN be adjusted while on the case.,64390,3
64390,"It is more as a deterence towards theft, not a complete halt to it.",64390,3
64390,The tsa lock is very comvient and makes going through pre check alot easier.,64390,3
64391,and cheap (that was expected).,64391,3
64391,"it was ok, that is all.",64391,3
64391,Probably not worth the price.,64391,3
64392,Fit ok but fairly thin and cheap construction.,64392,3
64392,Starting to loose shape after one wearing.,64392,3
64393,"loved the necklace, but it came with two broken flowers, as expected for the price.",64393,3
64394,"I mean, you get what you pay for but in this case it's a bit better.",64394,3
64394,"I followed what the other reviews said and got a size above my normal size (normally medium, got a large) I wish I would've gotten a medium because this is really big.",64394,3
64394,It's poor quality stitching and the seam looks like it was made by someone who'd never seen a shirt before and has a patch of cloth on it.,64394,3
64394,"Also, part of the string is coming off and was coming off when I pulled it from the package.",64394,3
64394,If you want a shirt that leaves you neck space then don't get this shirt.,64394,3
64394,It has none and somewhat suffocates you I guess you could say.,64394,3
64394,It pretty much attaches itself to your neck.,64394,3
64394,There was no tag on the short so there's no way to figure out which side is front or back because they're exactly the same.,64394,3
64394,One plus side is that the length in the picture is correct along with that it came about 2 weeks earlier than expected.,64394,3
64395,thought the length would be longer but my body could make it work.,64395,3
64395,made from durable and washer friendly material also.,64395,3
64396,Smaller than size says,64396,3
64397,Feather is not smooth.,64397,3
64398,Does not cover the full length of your abdomen.,64398,3
64398,"Comfy, breathable, but small.",64398,3
64399,Arches were too high for my feet.,64399,3
64402,The insole was poor quality and wore off after wearing twice.,64402,3
64402,But you can't expect much out of a cheap shoe.,64402,3
64403,"Rose gold in color, not yellow gold- quality is decent enough, but definitely don't expect what is pictured.",64403,3
64407,"I got xl, but it was very, very small.",64407,3
64407,Nice coat...I wish it fit,64407,3
64408,"This runs small, but is very pretty.",64408,3
64409,"They fit my size 9 (in women) feet, a little snug around the ankles, but i got them for my boyfriend who adores pugs.",64409,3
64409,They wouldn't even fit over his toes.,64409,3
64409,"The design is like what is pictured, but one sock has a hole in it and I'll probably have to throw them away after a few wears since they're so thin.",64409,3
64409,"It's not a horrible purchase, but they aren't for men with over size 8 feet.",64409,3
64410,Basically an iron on shirt but my daughter loved it so that is all that mattered.,64410,3
64411,Its is exactly as pictured if you have the same body as the model.,64411,3
64411,Its fits like its a size 2.,64411,3
64411,I bought the xxL.,64411,3
64412,back of dress is very nice but does not fit petite frame (short torso),64412,3
64413,I ordered a large and when I received it and put it on It fits like a medium then when I went to reorder another I had to order xxl.,64413,3
64414,the product is good in itself.,64414,3
64414,We used it for our kids too...more of an adult size but worked for the kids too.,64414,3
64414,The reason for 3 starts is the very strong chemical / petrol smell that these Balaclavas had when them arrived.,64414,3
64414,I washed them and sun dried them but the smell did not totally go away...was not very pleasant to wear them over the nose with that smell.,64414,3
64414,The draw strings are also a little tricky,64414,3
64415,Fun but not great quality,64415,3
64416,"Heavy duty fabric, well made and easy to wear.",64416,3
64416,I ordered men's instead of women's....the fit wasn't the best but if I had wanted them perfect I should have ordered women's:),64416,3
64417,This is a really cute shirt.,64417,3
64417,I ordered the wine color in medium based on previous reviews.,64417,3
64417,The color and quality are OK but it's just way too big.,64417,3
64417,"I usually wear size 0-2 or extra small (I'm 5' tall, 95 lbs.).",64417,3
64417,I wish it came in a smaller size.,64417,3
64417,If you're petite it will NOT work for you.,64417,3
64418,I had to get it altered a little (cost me $300)  and now it looks great.,64418,3
64418,"Knowing that I was ordering a dress online, I expected to get it alter to fit perfectly.",64418,3
64418,"The style of the dress looks nice (not exactly like the photo), but I was still satisfied with it overall.",64418,3
64418,There were some areas of the dress that looks like it wasn't made well - my tailor fixed it.,64418,3
64418,"The other problem that I had is that the dress isn't so much ivory, but a pale white color.",64418,3
64418,"I made contact with the company and we went back and forth on the color of the dress, and I was informed that they have had the same complaints from other buyers.",64418,3
64418,They insisted that I just get a partial refund for the inconvenience rather than the return of the dress.,64418,3
64418,"Before I agreed, I wanted to know how much to figure out if it was worth returning.",64418,3
64418,"After going back and forth for several weeks, I got a refund of  $40 without my prior agreement of the refund option.",64418,3
64418,I finally just let it go since I overall did like the style of the dress.,64418,3
64418,"If you're not set on an ivory dress and plan to pay extra to get it alter, this dress will do for the price.",64418,3
64419,Doesn't seem to cover everything.,64419,3
64419,"Unsure, but will continue trying!",64419,3
64420,While pregnant my breast are larger then usual and the top stretches down with all the weight of the material.,64420,3
64420,So more chest is exposed so I can only wear this as pajamas.,64420,3
64421,don't hang dry by the shoulders or you'll end up with a crappy fit.,64421,3
64421,"OK but not great shirts, quality is not the best.",64421,3
64424,Too big to be practical.,64424,3
64425,"Very cute, however the chain was broken when it was received.",64425,3
64426,This was not an XL by any means.,64426,3
64426,A tighter fit than I expected.,64426,3
64426,The color too was not as vibrant as the picture but the material is good and if you are a small framed person will look very well.,64426,3
64427,"Too small, but ok quality.",64427,3
64428,"Very stiff, doesnt bend around body like normal clothes.",64428,3
64429,"More of a goldenrod color than yellow, but otherwise cute socks.",64429,3
64431,Unfortunately this dress was nice but the boob area was to small for me and I brought a XL.,64431,3
64431,Very nice maxi dress over all and lined you can wear this to dinner or for a stroll on the beach.,64431,3
64431,If you are not a healthy chested person this dress is very nice.,64431,3
64432,Was good right after delivery but as days passed it was too big.,64432,3
64432,It is a high rise so need to lift up so won't have a bulge or show under clothing.,64432,3
64432,bought a smaller size and still fit big after a week from delivery.,64432,3
64433,I'm 5 8 150lbs.,64433,3
64435,"not sure of the material, is okay",64435,3
64437,"Product is small, but the description tells you that.",64437,3
64437,I was purposely looking for a small toy like this.,64437,3
64437,I bought this for my 8 month old and he loves it.,64437,3
64437,"The only ""disappointment"" is the first picture shows 4 of these and only one came.",64437,3
64437,I thought all four were part of the $6.99 price.,64437,3
64437,"Also, there isn't a clear description that you will only receive one.",64437,3
64437,Maybe update your product description.,64437,3
64439,"I really like the shirt, but it is a square.",64439,3
64439,The shoulders are too wide and the shirt is too short.,64439,3
64439,Best to pull it to stretch it.,64439,3
64440,One side of the fabric on the back of the hat has more fabrics so it looks strange when you're wearing it.,64440,3
64440,The blue on the hat is also a light sky blue not the color shown in the picture.,64440,3
64440,The brown is also a darker brown not the color shown in the picture.,64440,3
64440,Over all it's a cute hat.,64440,3
64441,"super fun, but way  bigger than you would expect.",64441,3
64442,"It wasn't as slouchy as I was expecting, and the item I received was not the magenta color pictured.",64442,3
64442,"Luckily, I also liked the bright pink color.",64442,3
64442,Just know that there is no purple in the color.,64442,3
64442,"The plus side is, it kept me very warm during fall in Vermont.",64442,3
64443,"This suit was extremely cute, but the cups were a little too large for my A cup figure and the back top part of the bottom half was way too big, it didn't even touch my back lol.",64443,3
64443,"I'm 5'5"" 110 lbs.",64443,3
64443,and the smallest size was too big :/ sent it back and amazon was awesome and refunded my $$ :),64443,3
64444,Love the look but it seems to be cut small,64444,3
64445,"Ok, the amount of glass provided is a bit cheezy (small) and there is a difference but i'm not sure its all that dramtatic",64445,3
64446,Sow poorly but pretty,64446,3
64447,Only one hand stripe for two bags.,64447,3
64448,It was fleece -- thicker than I expected since I wanted to wear it under a bike helmet.,64448,3
64448,"Not great for my purpose, but a perfectly good hat.",64448,3
64449,"The dress does run small, I'm slim 5'10"" 130 lbs and a small was too small for me.",64449,3
64449,The shoulders are really narrow so the neck and top keep riding up and wrinkling.,64449,3
64450,its a good idea but it sometimes gets stuck when trying to pull it out,64450,3
64451,Socks do not stay up the way I would have hoped,64451,3
64452,Boots were missing some of the gems and were stained.,64452,3
64453,I thought these were too small for my son's 7 year old feet.,64453,3
64453,So I got the adult size to compare.,64453,3
64453,They are the exact same size.,64453,3
64453,So the thing I learned is that you're going to have to do the different lacing configurations to get the right feel.,64453,3
64453,So follow the instructions for different lacing options and see if you can get a good fit that way bc from my kid's order and adult's order... they are the same length.,64453,3
64454,"Bulky, lowers screen responsiveness tremendously",64454,3
64455,"This piece is visually pretty, however, it didn't fit me as well as I would have liked with the decoration disappearing into my navel.",64455,3
64455,The area surrounding the piercing got pretty red (I have sensitive skin) so I won't be wearing again.,64455,3
64455,I wish this would have worked out better.,64455,3
64456,I like the glitter and halter style.,64456,3
64456,The bottom band gets twisted very easily (elastic unattached inside to allow full stretch) and I spend 10 minutes every time I'm gonna wear it just un-twisting it.,64456,3
64456,"Ordered an XL, still very tight on my 38C chest.",64456,3
64456,"Don't think D's or anything larger than 38"" could do it.",64456,3
64457,Awesome idea very soft material.,64457,3
64457,But also very BIG.,64457,3
64457,My newborn could not wear these they looked like it was more for 6mo+,64457,3
64459,is A BIT SMALL BUT USEABLE,64459,3
64460,I'm a 3X women whom is also tall.,64460,3
64460,They are two inches to short.,64460,3
64461,Stitching on one of the Y's broke day two.,64461,3
64461,Still more comfortable than uniform store bough ones.,64461,3
64461,Also the stirrups do not lay flat because of the way they are stitched.,64461,3
64462,The hangers are pretty good.,64462,3
64462,"They are adjustable, but start a little widener than I wanted.",64462,3
64462,If they started a little smaller 5 stars.,64462,3
64463,I really enjoyed this product.,64463,3
64463,The reason I gave this a 3 star was because how cheap the metal was; but I kind of expected it to be somewhat cheap.,64463,3
64463,"Not like break in your hand cheap, but cheap.",64463,3
64464,Cute cheep cat necklace.,64464,3
64464,Delivery was very fast,64464,3
64465,seemed to run small on US sizing.,64465,3
64465,Very pretty dress in person vs. online picture.,64465,3
64467,This is the second color of this b bag that I have ordered.,64467,3
64467,"I had read that people were having trouble with the straps pulling the grommet that attaches it to the to the bag pulling out, but I didn't have that problem with the last one, so I ordered this one and on the first use, the grommets started to pull out.",64467,3
64467,I happen to be visiting an aunt that is a seamstress so she is going to fix it for me.,64467,3
64467,"If I didn't love the look and size of this bag so much, I would probably send it back.",64467,3
64467,I have gotten several compliments during my first use of the bag.....if you can figure out how to reinforce the handle connection I would definitely get it.,64467,3
64467,"If you only have light items like towels and beach toys I would get it, if it is for heavy items, you might need to keep looking.",64467,3
64468,"Thought it came somewhat small and if you are looking for a shirt that's not going to wrinkle,  don't pick this one.",64468,3
64468,It came packaged extremely wrinkled and I couldn't get it out and it was a gift.,64468,3
64469,Broke after about a year of use unfortunately,64469,3
64470,"This coat has a nice style but runs very small, I am usually a size large but ordered the x-tra large as like my coats to have room for a sweater under them, I couldn't even button it!",64470,3
64470,"I was also disapointed in the material, it felt scratchy and a little thin for a winter coat.",64470,3
64471,"runs small, more like a juniors",64471,3
64472,runs very small- gave away as gift,64472,3
64473,I had to send it back because it was too small.,64473,3
64473,I normally wear a large or extra large.,64473,3
64473,But the extra large was too small.,64473,3
64474,I didn't realize how shear it is.,64474,3
64475,"Cute, but smaller beads than I had expected.",64475,3
64475,my daughter is 2.5 and they've held up well.,64475,3
64475,She hasn't played too much with them yet though.,64475,3
64477,"It is kind of tight puttin on from shoulders to my hooha but loosens up, i am a 38DD and when i snap the buttons together they gap open between each snap.",64477,3
64477,I would just sew it up but cant because its the only way in and out and you have to take it off just to use the toilet,64477,3
64478,"I am 5' 8"" and normally a size 10/M-L, and this bathing suit was way too short for me!",64478,3
64478,"The fit was actually pretty great on the bottom, but the top portion of the bathing suit was about 3 inches too short of where it actually belonged and what it was suppose to cover!",64478,3
64478,I sort of gathered this might be the case from the other reviews but took a chance anyways.,64478,3
64478,"The material was good quality though and I really loved the shiny scale print and bright purple top, so I'm going attempt to turn it into a two-piece!",64478,3
64478,"So if you're a taller body shape, this probably isn't the bathing suit for you.",64478,3
64479,"Cute hat, but the color of the linen was much more peachy than it appeared in the picture.",64479,3
64479,"I'm not sure that I really like it, and may send it back.",64479,3
64480,Pretty good quality just doesn't fit right,64480,3
64481,"wrong color, nice fabric.",64481,3
64482,This is really pretty pattern and decent quality for the price.,64482,3
64482,"Unfortunately, it is short...I had read the other reviews and knew it might be too short, but wanted to try it anyway.",64482,3
64482,"I'd only wear it if I wasn't really walking around the beach or pool, simply just to coverup a bit while laying out.",64482,3
64482,"I'm about 5'8"" for reference.",64482,3
64483,Gave it to my 7 yr old.,64483,3
64484,Just a little tight,64484,3
64485,this is an awkward fitting bathing suit.,64485,3
64485,I don't recommend it.,64485,3
64486,Was not as pictured.,64486,3
64486,"There is no moon , just a picture of the sun with a saying on it .",64486,3
64486,"With the moon missing , the shirt doesn't make any sense....",64486,3
64486,I am somewhat disappointed.,64486,3
64487,"Thinly woven, can see objects behind when held up (even without a light directly behind).",64487,3
64487,"Fabric is fairly stiff, not sure if actual cotton.",64487,3
64487,"Purchased for use in a metal shop (wiping grease or using to hold hair back away from lathes), does it's intended purpose but would not order again.",64487,3
64488,thin in the waist area - chunky grandson did not fit,64488,3
64489,It's cute but the sleeves are a bit short.,64489,3
64490,I ordered a 12 month and I'd say it fits like a small size 3 diaper.,64490,3
64491,I just love these shorts..I normally wear a 36 to account for my thick thighs and these were a bit baggy so next time I'll order a size down.,64491,3
64491,I actually wore them the whole weekend cause they looked and felt great.,64491,3
64492,Its great quality and very pretty but way smaller than I expected.,64492,3
64493,"It's a wallet, nice leather look but everytime I open the wallet to take something out of the money compartment it sounds like velcro being pulled apart.",64493,3
64493,ID and cards are rough to put in and take back out.,64493,3
64493,Idk if I'm liking this wallet but it was pricey so I'll keep it for now.,64493,3
64493,Look for Tanner Goods or Bexar for a better wallet.,64493,3
64494,Really like the design.,64494,3
64494,But not sure if they are sterling silver.,64494,3
64494,After wearing them for 3 days my ears started to become itchy and inflamed,64494,3
64495,"I was looking for a lighter pink, more of a midweight pullover, and it was a bit tight for me.",64495,3
64497,was made very well but ordered extra small and it was huge and bulky wish they made a smaller thinner version of this belt would have loved it.,64497,3
64498,I wasn't able to wear this romper.,64498,3
64500,"Very soft, comfortable but runs a little smaller (shorter) than expected for a small.",64500,3
64501,Runs small in sizes,64501,3
64502,"The dress was lovely, but it was too small and it didn't look good on me..",64502,3
64502,I returned it :(,64502,3
64503,ordered this for my sis who is 5.3 and petite in small and it was an exact fit...u may have a nip slip with the mesh part at the bikini top so just make sure to position it right and check it as the day goes on lol.,64503,3
64503,Other than that she loved the design and colour,64503,3
64504,I like to over portion.,64504,3
64504,"It's beautiful, but the under shirt that is sown inside fits very weird.",64504,3
64504,It barely goes over my chest.,64504,3
64505,I like look of this but would prefer that it was on a headband instead of a hair clip.,64505,3
64505,The clip wouldn't stay in my hair so I clipped into to a headband.,64505,3
64505,This was better but it kept slipping.,64505,3
64505,I should have glued it to the head band.,64505,3
64506,It's an okay watch for the price.,64506,3
64506,It helped my child learn how to tell time.,64506,3
64506,The problem I had with it was how quickly and badly the white band stained.,64506,3
64506,"If you have an active child that plays on the playground the watch itself will last, but I'd highly recommend a different color.",64506,3
64508,I got the XL after reading the reviews.,64508,3
64508,It runs pretty large and flowy- I would base the size on your arm circumference and what that would equate to in size.,64508,3
64509,"Very baggy and poorly made, bummer.",64509,3
64510,"The custome is very comfortable, true to the size.",64510,3
64510,However the mask is uncomfortable the eyes and nose are made from the same material as the rest of the suit and we had to cut holes in them so my boyfriend can see/breathe (looked kind of silly) but it works for just one night.,64510,3
64511,Way too big...despite using the sizing chart,64511,3
64513,It is a nice watch but the links are absolutely impossible to get out.,64513,3
64513,"I purchased this watch because they advertized that ""links are easy to remove"" and they are not.",64513,3
64513,Considering sending the watch back to look somewhere else that has truthful descriptions.,64513,3
64514,Took over a month to get here.,64514,3
64514,"When it finally did, I was happy with the product.",64514,3
64515,"Too small, didn't fit face",64515,3
64516,Overall it looks like the real thing.,64516,3
64516,I've already had to tighten screws that were loose and the strap it comes with feels really cheap and is not what was shown.,64516,3
64516,For the money it's okay.,64516,3
64517,"Very beautiful but a little stiff, not as soft as i'd imagine or would like.",64517,3
64520,I didn't receive the color in the picture.,64520,3
64520,"It is not two toned, just all solid navy denim.",64520,3
64521,"Material is good, but is very small.",64521,3
64522,It is good for the quality but it seems like the earrings are made for kids size.,64522,3
64522,I am not happy with picture shown for the star since the star is not edged but curved.,64522,3
64522,These type of earrings usually have 3 holes to adjust the fitting but the only have 2 holes since my ear lobes are large it barely fits.,64522,3
64522,When I ordered the price was .79c but after few minutes it came down to .77c that is unfair for the purchaser.,64522,3
64522,I am happy with delivery since it came 2 days before delivery date.,64522,3
64522,It really worth .75 cents and don't buy as a gift for any adult....size is good for kids only.,64522,3
64523,"These are obviously of Asian origin so being a 32 inch waist and a size medium normally I ordered a large size and they fit perfectly, a medium would have been too small.",64523,3
64523,I ordered these because i wanted something cool while living in a hot climate.,64523,3
64523,"A couple of points of interest, the Fabric: 93% Ice silk, is listed as Polyester on the tag and the wash care instructions indicate that they can't go in the dryer.",64523,3
64524,I had to return this item though I liked the material is just wasn't what I was looking for it fit very snug.,64524,3
64524,I have returned this and still waiting for it to be credited to my card its been a month,64524,3
64525,"This is a cute suit to be sure , but the suit you get is not the one pictured here.",64525,3
64525,..but not the same.,64525,3
64525,"It would be adorable for a teenager and is not quiet as ""sexy"" as the pictures here.",64525,3
64526,Would have preferred raised/embroidered lettering on the cap but overall it's reasonable for what I paid.,64526,3
64526,Generally satisfied with the purchase.,64526,3
64527,I ordered my size but the fit is a bit snug.,64527,3
64527,"The material is a stretchy, shiny one not a linen type which it looks like in the picture and the shape of the leg is more fitted then pictured.",64527,3
64527,But overall I will make it work.,64527,3
64528,Love the design but for the size it fit 2 size to small,64528,3
64529,"Nice shirt, but really runs small.",64529,3
64529,No give in the fabric to stretch it out.,64529,3
64530,I'm 5'9 and this dress was not long enough.,64530,3
64531,Had to return because the sleeves were to tight for my arms,64531,3
64532,"I love the bottoms, and the top is exactly like another style I bought the same day, who would have thunk I got three suits that are exactly alike under three different order titles, and makers?",64532,3
64532,yikes  good thing they fit,64532,3
64533,Could not fit iphone5 no way; and that was a deal buster (also would not stay closed when using the chain).,64533,3
64534,"The large was tight on me, and not in good way, and I'm not large.",64534,3
64535,The breast cup was too big,64535,3
64536,Under some lighting these can look very orange.,64536,3
64537,"I like the shirt, I guess.",64537,3
64537,The only real issue is that the design makes it look like Rorschach has boobs when you wear it.,64537,3
64537,"No real problem, I think it's kind of funny actually, but still.",64537,3
64537,I don't think that the designers remembered one very basic part of the female anatomy.,64537,3
64538,The size was too big,64538,3
64539,"I loved the shirt, but it Shrunk after the 1st wash....",64539,3
64540,The banding folds weird and the bottoms banding had a broken line in it.,64540,3
64541,"Quality is OK, but the size was much to large on me....Have to return it.",64541,3
64542,I barely used this during my pregnancy.,64542,3
64542,"I'm a size xs, and this didn't fit snugly until my 8th month!",64542,3
64542,At that point it felt hot and itchy.,64542,3
64542,"It was very obvious that I was wearing it, even with a black shirt.",64542,3
64542,It was always sliding down.,64542,3
64542,"I regret this purchase, especially since I found cheaper options available in local stores.",64542,3
64543,My grandson looked adorable but it barely fit.,64543,3
64543,It runs small !,64543,3
64544,These fit OK its just that they're too short.,64544,3
64544,"(my hand size is 9"" around) They fit more like a work glove, covering the hand but stopping just before the wrist.",64544,3
64544,I wanted something longer that would go into the sleeve of my coat.,64544,3
64544,They worked on my phone just fine.,64544,3
64544,Just too short for my preference.,64544,3
64544,"Pictured from L-R.... Ridic, my current non-texting glove and Isotoner gloves size large.",64544,3
64545,"a little larger than I expected , but ok",64545,3
64546,Good product except the stud does not fit in the needle to pull it threw so it was a struggle to get the stud threw the skin.,64546,3
64547,I love this wallet but was extremely disappointed when I handwashed it and the dye ran.,64547,3
64547,The white flowers know look tie dyed.,64547,3
64547,I aspect better quality from Vera Bradley.,64547,3
64548,The ring that holds the long strap broke within 2 days.,64548,3
64548,I returned it and have received a new one that looks stronger than the first.,64548,3
64548,Maybe just a defect.,64548,3
64548,This one is holding up OK so far.,64548,3
64548,"I like it otherwise, it would be nice if the middle had a divider - it is kind of a bottomless pit.",64548,3
64548,The pockets in the inside are also too small but I manage.,64548,3
64549,I love the details with the tassels but they come right off.,64549,3
64549,I only got to wear it once becuse of this.,64549,3
64549,The color is vibrant and catchy.,64549,3
64549,Definitely was in love with it until the tassle problem occured.,64549,3
64550,Was delivered on time but unfortunately does not fit my pandora bracelet.,64550,3
64551,Expected the sister tag to be larger,64551,3
64552,Had to shorten these,64552,3
64554,It was good enough for the derby party and everyone loved the netting!,64554,3
64554,It was a little snug so I only gave it 3 stars but it was perfect for what I needed it for!,64554,3
64555,I couldn't get them through my ears.,64555,3
64555,I'll have to force them and they already started to hurt.,64555,3
64556,This is such a beautiful bathing suit in the picture but just did not fit right.,64556,3
64556,A small was too small and a medium was too big.,64556,3
64557,Get what you pay for here.,64557,3
64557,"Logo is cool, the fit is semi worse than a truck stop hat...looks good in the back glass of my car...",64557,3
64558,"Okay, just smaller than anticipated, didn't realize how small 3mm was until I got this.",64558,3
64558,Gave it to wife to wear.,64558,3
64559,"Beautiful, but the sleeves length is to short.",64559,3
64560,the size chart or the way the reviewers explain how it fits is poor.,64560,3
64560,"This was the size i followed one reviwer

and it fits kinda tight.",64560,3
64560,I will give it to a friend.,64560,3
64561,Used as a cover up and it was perfect for that,64561,3
64562,Tight waist band huge hip & leg circumference,64562,3
64564,Top is higher up on neck than expected...,64564,3
64564,I'm 5'4'' and usually wear a small/size 4 pants... not a good fit for me.,64564,3
64564,Too baggy and not flattering.,64564,3
64565,I loved the shoes when I got them as I've always wanted a pair of Vans Slip On shoes.,64565,3
64565,"For some reason though after wearing them for only two months they started getting holes where my big toes are (and no I don't have crazy long toenails or anything), the backs of them broke down pretty quickly for being slip on shoes and the tread on the bottom wore fast.",64565,3
64566,you get what you pay for!,64566,3
64566,"If ur looking for a bra with support, this is not the one.",64566,3
64566,Unfortunately this bra won't hold up ur girls.,64566,3
64566,BUT it's a cute piece to wear under a v neck or a tank top.,64566,3
64566,"Show a little lace ;) I wore it over my regular white bra, and it adds a nice touch.",64566,3
64566,"Perfect w a summer outfit

Overall quality, is ok.",64566,3
64566,There are adjustable shoulder straps.,64566,3
64566,"But the hook in the back, had one loop.",64566,3
64566,And the loop isn't sewn well.,64566,3
64566,"Iam a 34B, ordered a large.",64566,3
64566,Should have went with a medium.,64566,3
64567,It is too small for my iPhone 6 Plus,64567,3
64568,Great for a date night but not every day use,64568,3
64569,This was way to small for the posted sizes.,64569,3
64569,I've purchased other ETOSELL products such as the Womens Solid Deep V Padded Bra Push Up Bra which fit great but this was much smaller for the same size.,64569,3
64569,Would look great if it was larger.,64569,3
64569,Bottoms were also very small.,64569,3
64570,I would love it more if it were more waistline friendly for plus size people and if the zipper didn't randomly break (I wasn't wearing it.,64570,3
64570,It broke while in my purse),64570,3
64572,i didn't like it but i got a full refund ^_^,64572,3
64574,Very cute piece of jewelry.,64574,3
64574,The only down side is that the golden paint tarnished quickly.,64574,3
64574,"However, since it is small and in a discreet area, that's hardly noticeable.",64574,3
64575,"i liked this shirt immediately from looking at it, when i got it it was loose fit and comfortable.",64575,3
64575,however the fabric kept peeling off there was little small cotton balls all over my arms and hair.,64575,3
64576,"I like it, but I feel like the clip is bending out/getting loose, and i can't seem to bend it the other way and make it tight again.",64576,3
64576,"In hindsight, I would have bought something with a spring clip.",64576,3
64577,"Fabric is kind of stiff, even after a few washings.",64577,3
64579,"The black ones are a disappointment, they pill too much.",64579,3
64579,The pink ones are ok.,64579,3
64580,fit is short but did not shrink in dryer,64580,3
64581,"These are nice heavy cargo pants, but they really are made for skinny people.",64581,3
64581,I ordered a M and L and neither fit comfortably.,64581,3
64581,"I am 5'2"" and about 145-150lbs.",64581,3
64581,"The M would not button, not even close.",64581,3
64581,"The L fit, but were not comfortable, too snug in the hips and the waist band cut in when I sat down.",64581,3
64582,Nice shirt but too large.,64582,3
64582,Sent it back and ordered another shirt in the correct size.,64582,3
64583,Order at least 2 sizes bigger,64583,3
64584,It is pretty but very thin.,64584,3
64584,And if you have big wrists I would suggest not to buy.,64584,3
64584,Even though it expands it wouldn't look right if you expanded it too far.,64584,3
64584,Definitely not worth the money I spent.,64584,3
64585,It's kinda big on my head.,64585,3
64585,Not as flattering on.,64585,3
64585,But keeps the sun off my face & matches some outfits.,64585,3
64586,"Not like the picture, there is a lot of black in it",64586,3
64587,"It was a pretty dress, just a little big.",64587,3
64588,"When I ordered this dress, I expected it to be too small, but ironically, it ended up being slightly too large--and I'm in the larger end of the one size bracket.",64588,3
64588,"I did not like how the dress fit overall; when I put it on, it looked nothing like the picture.",64588,3
64588,"The waist was too loose, and the bust area hung low and sagged--I guess my bust wasn't large enough for this dress.",64588,3
64588,Just did not fit the way I was expecting.,64588,3
64588,"I'm disappointed, as I planned to use this dress as my wedding dress.",64588,3
64589,The design was fantastic it just came to me wrinkled.,64589,3
64590,Very comfortable but WARM!,64590,3
64590,multilayered materials don't breathe very well.,64590,3
64590,Cute but not for hot days.,64590,3
64591,"I have purchased the MOON two times, the second one hadn't such a clear image.",64591,3
64592,I did not like the fabric!,64592,3
64592,it was a cheap plastic!!,64592,3
64593,Very cute and looks nice  I usally wear a large but I ordered and extra large to be be sure it fits good and it still feels a bit to snug.. hopefully I can strech it out a little so i can enjoy wearing it..definitely  order at least 2 sizes bigger..,64593,3
64595,Bought a few months ago.,64595,3
64595,It's slightly warped and tarnished but I like the weathered look as I can be a bit rough on jewelry anyway.,64595,3
64595,All dangles are still on.,64595,3
64595,Just don't wear in water.,64595,3
64596,"For the price, I love it.",64596,3
64596,The ribbon that is around the hats border did not come on sewed so I had to have a friend sew it on as I don't know how.,64596,3
64596,"It did come in a bit large for me, as it slides a bit and I've never had a hat that's too big for me, too small yes if I get a kids hat but not too big.",64596,3
64596,I still like it though as these hats usually cost $25 and up.,64596,3
64597,Little small for a girl age 3,64597,3
64598,Sized about 6 and 1/2 when ordered 8,64598,3
64599,"zipper opening too small, otherwise nice",64599,3
64600,The  earrings arrived with TWO broken stones and are not immediately wearable since I must now go and buy glue to affix the stones.,64600,3
64600,I do not recommend this product.,64600,3
64601,"Nice hat, a tad tight",64601,3
64602,"Not bad, not great.",64602,3
64603,I read the reviews before ordering and I ordered up.,64603,3
64603,I wear a 12/14 so I ordered the US 2XL Asian 4Xl and it fits.,64603,3
64603,"I'm tall, no hips, small butt and also a triple D in bra size.",64603,3
64604,Cozy but a little snugger than expected by the size chart.,64604,3
64604,Cowl neck is a little large.,64604,3
64605,"A bit difficult at times to get them comfortable and to stay in place, but, I now keep them in a container in my bag in case I forget the big guys when I go out, then they come in really handy.",64605,3
64606,Was a bit boxy in the waist area,64606,3
64607,"this fit as expected, runs small so I went up a size.",64607,3
64607,it ends up being a little bit wide/boxy though.,64607,3
64607,"The graphic is really pretty though, will have to see how well it does in the wash.",64607,3
64607,The shipping took an incredibly long time coming from overseas.,64607,3
64607,Overall I got what I expected in quality and fit.,64607,3
64608,Gave it three stars because it looks exactly like the photo and is nice quality.,64608,3
64608,"Only problem is this dress is made for smaller gals and having DD's did not help, looks like a shirt on me but it's cute!",64608,3
64609,"Cute pajamas, but unfortunately they stretch out while my little one is wearing them.",64609,3
64609,I was disappointed that they only fit snugly for a few minutes before starting to loosen.,64609,3
64609,"They feel very soft, though.",64609,3
64610,"The graphic on the front sticks to itself, so it's not as pliable as I expected it to be.",64610,3
64611,It came in great condition and looks just like on the picture ^^ I like it a lot !,64611,3
64611,It just fits a little tight on me (chest area)  but I still love it,64611,3
64612,Item needs LOTS of ironing.,64612,3
64613,It was not as long in the front as shown on th model,64613,3
64614,I like the horizontal fly.,64614,3
64614,It gives some space for expansion in the front area.,64614,3
64614,"The front pouch is *way* too small for me, however, as the fly gaps open so much that there's a bit of a peek-a-book effect where you can see part of my shaft.",64614,3
64614,Would only recommend these for men of less than average endowment.,64614,3
64614,"The leg holes have no firm elastic, either, meaning that after a few hours of wear, the leg holes lose their shape entirely & the seat of the underwear starts creeping up my backside, while the loose legs bunch up (visibly, with dress slacks or thinner pants).",64614,3
64616,Just too big for kids ages 6 and 8.,64616,3
64617,"It has good style, color and size on the outside.",64617,3
64617,The inside pockets are tight and the zippers are sticky.,64617,3
64617,The outside pull strap for the zipper has already came apart and fell off.,64617,3
64619,Cute but not quite right,64619,3
64620,"The buckle is inaccurate in the photo as compared to what I received, the square detail does not have the stamped crosshatch pattern, it is a matte texture that is uneven and messy, (it almost looks like something was glued there and fell off!)",64620,3
64620,I am disappointed since this detail is why I chose this belt over other similar styles.,64620,3
64620,"The nylon belt is pretty thick, like a seatbelt, and seems durable enough.",64620,3
64620,"I will keep the belt since it was under 10 bucks, but I still wish I had got what I paid for.",64620,3
64621,The Babyroom Excavator pajamas are a hit at our house.,64621,3
64621,I feel that the sizing runs pretty small.,64621,3
64621,My son swims in most size 3 clothes and these fit him just right in size 3.,64621,3
64621,The cotton is nice enough.,64621,3
64621,The fabric feels a little scratchy due to the pattern on the shorts.,64621,3
64621,And it makes me crazy that there is no tag in the shorts.,64621,3
64621,Maybe it just doesn't matter which way they go.,64621,3
64621,They make the boy happy.,64621,3
64622,I fell in love with this cardigan just from the picture...,64622,3
64622,I got the cardigan and its absolutely beautiful but the feel of it has to be the most awkward thing in the world.,64622,3
64622,I'm not 100% happy with it but at least I know I don't see very many other people wearing it.,64622,3
64622,"I ordered a small thinking it would be too small (I'm roughly 5'7, 130 pounds) because my size fluctuates in EVERYTHING so I'm always playing a guessing game.",64622,3
64622,"The small was actually a bit large in the sleeves, they slightly droop and cover my hands but an XS would probably be too small for my waist.",64622,3
64622,I will definitely buy from seller again.,64622,3
64623,Love the saying and the pink!,64623,3
64623,But it runs rather large...,64623,3
64624,This suit is really cute and of good quality.,64624,3
64624,However it is a bit small.,64624,3
64624,I am a size 10-12 and purchased the large.,64624,3
64624,It cuts in too much for my liking.,64624,3
64624,I have kept it as an option as I continue to lose weight.,64624,3
64625,It wasn't as expected.,64625,3
64625,The picture is kinda misleading.,64625,3
64625,The little ball inside is extremely tiny not like the picture shows.,64625,3
64625,It doesn't glow blue either.,64625,3
64625,It glows a little bit green (like glow in the dark stars) but not for long.,64625,3
64625,I like the chain it's pretty long.,64625,3
64625,It came fast though (less then two weeks).,64625,3
64626,"much too small, otherwise color & faric are good for the price.",64626,3
64626,"it""s just too small for me to ever wear--got a medium, gave to my daughter who is a small & fit her well.",64626,3
64627,"I returned too small for me, and I normally order a large.",64627,3
64628,It was a little bit big but I think I ordered the wrong size.,64628,3
64628,Other than that they work fine and I love them.,64628,3
64629,Super cute and sturdy.,64629,3
64629,However the wrap on the frame makes the glasses look a lot like safety glasses.,64629,3
64630,"Shirt is Ok, the color is much lighter than the picture.",64630,3
64630,Fit was a little larger but maybe it shrinks a bit,64630,3
64632,I ordered a Small because I normally wear a size 0 in pants.,64632,3
64632,"They fit, but were more tight fitting than I wanted.",64632,3
64632,I'd only recommend them for someone who wears a 00.,64632,3
64632,So I returned and ordered a Medium.,64632,3
64632,The M was huge on me.,64632,3
64632,I'd guess the M would fit a size 4 or 6.,64632,3
64633,Very dainty & tiny as illustrated on site.,64633,3
64634,"My main complaint is that the color (Rose) wasn't what was pictured online; it was a lighter, more pink hue.",64634,3
64634,The fit is fine though.,64634,3
64634,I've yet to wear it.,64634,3
64635,"I would definitely not refer to this bag as ""extra large"" - but its super cute for just carrying my things...much to the dismay of my boyfriend",64635,3
64636,"The top fits fear but you can see they didn't rinse the dye well so its not an enterily black color, also the bottoms are too small.",64636,3
64636,"I bought the M, im 32b, size 4 or 6 in pants and it literally cut my hip so the bottom is useless and nothing stretchy.",64636,3
64636,You can probably order this if  you are skinny and have small boobs.,64636,3
64638,"The print wore off very quickly, but it is a stylish and nice backpack.",64638,3
64640,Nice jacket but runs super super small.,64640,3
64640,"I usually wear a medium, size 9, and ordered a xl and it still didn't fit.",64640,3
64640,Bummed cause it seems like a super cute jacket.,64640,3
64640,Hopefully I can exchange it for a bigger size.,64640,3
64641,"I really loved this dress, but the fit wouldn't work for the bust area.",64641,3
64641,I loved the fabric and embroidery.,64641,3
64641,"However, the line where the tie-string is came right across the bust area.",64641,3
64641,"I think that if you have more than an A or at most B cup, the waistline will not fall underneath the bust.",64641,3
64641,"That might not be a deal breaker for some, but for me it made the dress look frumpy (gave me the maternity look).",64641,3
64641,"I will be returning it, but I'd still recommend for someone with the right body shape for the dress.",64641,3
64641,It is very unique and made very well.,64641,3
64641,I do agree with the ordering a size up though.,64641,3
64642,Cute but definitely smaller than expected,64642,3
64643,sleeves tight and runs small,64643,3
64645,"The outfit is cute, but after one wear the pants have severe pilling and look like they have been through 50 washes.",64645,3
64645,"The style of the outfit is nice though, and I doubt anyone notices the pilling except for me when I'm doing laundry.",64645,3
64646,So it's okay if you only have 5 or so cards to carry and little to no cash.,64646,3
64646,The clasp broke fairly quickly but I use it anyway.,64646,3
64646,I just can't seem to find what I'm looking for in a slim card wallet.,64646,3
64646,I will try something different next time.,64646,3
64647,The color is brilliant and the material is wonderful!,64647,3
64647,I wish they would have offered an extra small because this small fits like a medium.,64647,3
64648,"The bathing suit is just a little too big, but I can make it work.",64648,3
64648,I a m a little disappointed with the bottoms.,64648,3
64648,They have no elastic in them so they easily ride up and show off my bottom.,64648,3
64649,Pretty but runs on the large size.,64649,3
64649,It was a gift and luckily the girl has larger wrists than myself.,64649,3
64650,"I ordered one of these bracelets and absolutely loved it, so i ordered another for a friend.",64650,3
64650,The order arrived sooner than predicted which was nice.,64650,3
64650,"Unfortunately, the second bracelet is smaller than the first and hard to get on which is very disappointing.",64650,3
64651,Love the t shirt.,64651,3
64651,Just too small will return it.,64651,3
64652,Love the color and fit.,64652,3
64652,It was very wrinkled when I got it.,64652,3
64652,Big creases in the top front and back.,64652,3
64653,"The shirt runs short, do not buy if you have a long torso.",64653,3
64653,The sleeve hooks are too big and you can't roll the sleeves up like the picture shows.,64653,3
64653,Material is very see through.,64653,3
64653,Back is very cute and for that reason only it gets three stars.,64653,3
64654,Colors are pale and fabric is thin.,64654,3
64654,No reorder on this.,64654,3
64654,"I'm 5'5"" and weigh 147.",64654,3
64654,Wouldn't go over my head.,64654,3
64655,"I have had it just a brief time, and the lining is already coming out and it has a dent in the outside.",64655,3
64655,"I had a similar one previously, and I used it for over five years.",64655,3
64655,I don't think this one will last throughout the summer.,64655,3
64656,Fit okay everywhere but waist.,64656,3
64657,"Not bad, but you get what you pay for.",64657,3
64657,Doesn't fit like I expected; it is pretty loose and the bottom does not look like the picture.,64657,3
64657,Was impressed with how early it arrived though.,64657,3
64659,"Have a hard time keeping the glasses on, they have a tendency to slip off even though I snug up th sides.",64659,3
64660,"Fits snug, but the neckline drops way too low!",64660,3
64661,Rub on the back of heel.,64661,3
64661,And aren't as tall on the ankle as appears in photo.,64661,3
64662,Stretches out easily and the leg holes seem to large for me.,64662,3
64662,"Wouldn't buy again, but will keep wearing.",64662,3
64663,"My iPhone 6 fits inside it and it's overall cute, however the stylus was missing.",64663,3
64664,I like this suit!,64664,3
64664,"I want to keep it, but cannot.",64664,3
64664,"The sizing if just plain OFF....I am 5'7"" 135 and usually wear a medium.",64664,3
64664,"This was too large in the bust, which never happens, because I am a 32DD, and a bit loose in the trunk area...I am afraid to order a small, because I know it will be too short for my trunk as I have a long torso.",64664,3
64664,"It is a lovely suit, but the sizing is not right.",64664,3
64665,Looked very well made but the color was way more orange than I expected.,64665,3
64665,Didn't match any of my shoes.,64665,3
64670,"nice suit, but the bra part didn't fit at all....",64670,3
64671,I am a large; I ordered an XL and it is way too small!,64671,3
64672,"Way too large, had to give it to a taller friend.",64672,3
64672,Good quality fabric and cut for the price.,64672,3
64673,I love this suit buy the medium top was a bit too big.,64673,3
64673,I'm a 34 B and ended up needing a small top.,64673,3
64673,But overall the quality is great and I love it!,64673,3
64675,"Liked the feel, smooth fabric, holds the package well.",64675,3
64676,Nice quality but they are sized more like a juniors sizing with a narrow cut to the body and sleeve.,64676,3
64676,No US address for returns.,64676,3
64677,Product material is not very good.,64677,3
64678,Real small but I fixed them added material,64678,3
64679,"Cute tanks, but they are see through and make you somewhat boxy.",64679,3
64680,Well they fit great the only thing there is a extra piece that shouldn't be there but I should be able to fix that.,64680,3
64681,"Has a chain to clip for  multiple sizes, but these did not fit me.",64681,3
64681,I would measure ankle and get item specifics before purchasing.,64681,3
64681,Super cute and sparkly though!,64681,3
64682,Didn't realize it was see through :( Had to buy an under shirt,64682,3
64683,Holy cow... these are see threw.,64683,3
64683,"These are not to be worn as pants, but great for under skirts and long tunics that will cover your business.",64683,3
64683,"(wink)
Material is very soft and pattern was very cute.",64683,3
64684,It was pretty and would have been great if it accommodated for more curves.,64684,3
64684,This dress seems like it was sewn for a rectangular shaped person.,64684,3
64684,"Also the fabric is thin and the ""belt"" is just a cheap looking stretchy thing.",64684,3
64685,Not a soft shirt but looks nice.,64685,3
64688,"I would love to give these more than three stars, but unfortunately, they are too short.",64688,3
64688,"I am 6'1"" and I was not able to use these suspenders at all.",64688,3
64688,"They have a great design and great feel, but just don't meet my height.",64688,3
64689,this was ordered from the size chart and is extremely small I ordered a 3x and there is no way I can use this.,64689,3
64689,my sister who also wanted one now has one and fits her perfectly.,64689,3
64689,I contacted company and the gave a credit on account.,64689,3
64689,sure wish was the right size.,64689,3
64691,Way to large as I am not a tall person.,64691,3
64691,Wish they had in smaller size,64691,3
64692,I love the vibrant colors but when it stretches (such as over my chest...) you can see vertical white lines so that the print gets distorted.,64692,3
64692,It's very comfortable material.,64692,3
64694,"Although fit was good, they still slip off.",64694,3
64695,This product is a little bit smaller than expected.,64695,3
64695,"I read that in other reviews, so I ordered a size up, and now it fits fine.",64695,3
64695,"The purple is more of a wine red and the stripes are black, although I thought them to be brown.",64695,3
64695,"The quality is pretty good, especially for that price.",64695,3
64695,"I don't like this shirt as much, because I have more of a curvy figure and I think this striped shirt does not necessarily complement my figure.",64695,3
64695,"It is definitely more a long shirt, and not a dress, and I wear it with pants.",64695,3
64695,The product arrived before the estimated date.,64695,3
64697,"Nice glasses, but cheaply made.",64697,3
64697,Good thing they didn't cost much....,64697,3
64698,"bought for a friend who has peripheral neuropathy in his feet, and I thought these would be perfect to keep his feet warm / as the ad said / they were expensive too.",64698,3
64698,"They do not keep his feel warm; however, he kept them and said that maybe in the summer they would.",64698,3
64698,"They were,  however, a better buy than anywhere else in town, I might add.",64698,3
64699,strap tore off after 3 weeks of use!,64699,3
64699,do love the colors,64699,3
64700,The width is perfect but this is too short.,64700,3
64701,Fabric is thin but overall it's nice,64701,3
64702,The top fits Exact to size but bottoms are tiny.,64702,3
64703,These boots are very cute however the bunnies are not sewn on well and my toddler was able to rip them off with one try.,64703,3
64703,The boots are pretty good quality and still look cute without the bunnies so overall I am happy with them.,64703,3
64704,It looks great on line but not so great on me.,64704,3
64704,I don't like it,64704,3
64705,The ring came on time.,64705,3
64705,We ordered it as a place holder until the ring is out of layaway so we could go ahead announce.,64705,3
64705,It was gorgeous way more than I expected!,64705,3
64705,Got it last Sunday on 3/13 woke up this am to 2 stones missing.,64705,3
64705,Providing the reason I gave it 3 stars.,64705,3
64705,You get what you pay for can't be mad.,64705,3
64706,I am on the fence.,64706,3
64706,"I bought a large and it seemed to fit fine, but I walked over to the mirror and I looked pregnant.",64706,3
64706,My stomach does not really stick out but this made my stomach look rounded-I have a few rolls on the side.,64706,3
64706,Maybe I have the wrong size an XL would be too big but maybe I needed a medium.,64706,3
64706,the hooks were not that bad.,64706,3
64706,I will try to sleep with it.,64706,3
64706,And it is on the short side.,64706,3
64706,The woman in the picture must be 4 feet tall.,64706,3
64706,I am an even 5 feet tall and this did not go down to my hips and there was about an inch between the top and where my breasts hang.,64706,3
64706,"So, I am not really impressed.",64706,3
64708,"The quality is a little poor, however you are getting what you pay for.",64708,3
64708,"I still love it may get a different chain for as the chain feels sharp on my skin, and may catch on some clothing.",64708,3
64709,I was a little shocked.,64709,3
64709,"I knew it was going to be small but, it literally fits my 4 year old daughter better than me and she's not husky by any interpretation of the definition.",64709,3
64709,"It is a very thin material which doesn't bother me because, it being a lacy back, I wasn't purchasing it for warmth.",64709,3
64709,"I was just hoping to be able to wear it at all, which I cant.",64709,3
64709,It is much too small in the arms and I usually wear a medium.,64709,3
64709,"I am bummed I bought it, honestly but my daughter loves it and it will probably fit her for a year or so.",64709,3
64710,A poor fit and cheaply made.,64710,3
64711,The build quality is nice.,64711,3
64711,It can be a bit awkward to use due to the stiffness of the bands provided.,64711,3
64711,I also learned to not keep my ID directly under one of the black pieces because it will leave a black residue on the ID.,64711,3
64712,The mickey on the red pair has started to peel and fade after just a few washes.,64712,3
64713,"Very sheer, must double-layer.",64713,3
64715,Got an XL and it still fight kind of tight around the arms.,64715,3
64715,Super cute and warm!,64715,3
64716,These are nice pants for the price.,64716,3
64716,"I am not 100% confident that they won't be see through if bending over in yoga though, as they are a tad see through.",64716,3
64716,"If I hold them up to the light, can see through them easily.",64716,3
64716,I got the hot pink color.,64716,3
64716,"Before I wear them to class, definitely going to have to check that.",64716,3
64716,"Will probably need to wear nude bikini style undies, wouldn't feel comfortable in my usual thong.",64716,3
64716,I would say I am between sizes.,64716,3
64716,"A small would definitely be way too see through, I did get the medium.",64716,3
64716,They are NOT compression tights!,64716,3
64716,I am 5'6 140lbs.,64716,3
64717,I ordered a large and it is a little tight,64717,3
64718,3 stars because it's advertised as a midi dress which it isn't.. a little big for a small I usually wear small.. other than that it's a cute dress...guess you can't expect much for that price,64718,3
64719,This is a really cute shirt and my 5 year old loves it.,64719,3
64719,It is a little slim fitting but thankfully he has a slim build.,64719,3
64719,"The material is decent though we have only washed it once, hung to dry with no issues that I see as of yet.",64719,3
64719,I am sure it will be worn many more times though.,64719,3
64719,I think the quality is okay.,64719,3
64719,It isn't incredible and since this style is similar to a company that charges a lot more (for incredible quality) you get what you pay for and I am not disappointed.,64719,3
64719,It it a solid 3.5 stars.,64719,3
64719,I am not crazy about the fit but my son is very happy with it so I stayed at a 3 for both of us.,64719,3
64719,"I think it is a great birthday shirt...you may want to size up depending on the build, length is perfect though.",64719,3
64720,It was not well sewn,64720,3
64721,Took a  l o n g  time to arrive.,64721,3
64721,A little over priced...,64721,3
64723,"This was OK, but not as useful as I had hoped it would be.",64723,3
64723,I think maybe I waited too long to purchase this.,64723,3
64723,"I went through the first two months of my pregnancy using the hair tie trick to continue wearing my pre-maternity jeans (you know, where you loop a hair tie through the button hole of your jeans then around the button, to hold the jeans together but with a lot more slack than actually buttoning them).",64723,3
64723,"I eventually got to a point where even doing that was too tight, plus by then I also needed to leave my pants unzipped.",64723,3
64723,"While my shirts were long enough to cover up the button being undone, they didn't cover the zipper too.",64723,3
64723,So I bought the belly band.,64723,3
64723,It did indeed work as claimed--it allowed me to leave my jeans unbuttoned and unzipped--but it really only worked for about a few weeks to a month.,64723,3
64723,Then I was too big for my pre-maternity jeans AND the belly band.,64723,3
64723,When I would sit the band was very uncomfortable at that point.,64723,3
64723,"So, in short, this does work as intended, but probably not for very long.",64723,3
64723,Maybe if I had bought it earlier in my pregnancy and used it for a few months I would have felt differently about it.,64723,3
64723,"As it is now, I feel like I really didn't get very much use out of it for the price.",64723,3
64723,"My only hope is that after I have the baby, I'll get further use out of it, as I tried to fit back into my pre-pregnancy jeans.",64723,3
64724,It doesn't look nearly as stylish as the photo.,64724,3
64724,The cowl neck is very deceiving in the picture.,64724,3
64724,The neck is not high but more like a typical sweatshirt.,64724,3
64725,Bottoms fit.. Top fit my chest but not under it.,64725,3
64725,I guess thats to be expected,64725,3
64726,There was a price tag with it and it was for less than what I payed for it.,64726,3
64726,Also it didn't say it was for filtered cigarettes when I needed it for 100's.,64726,3
64727,Not really Plus Sized.,64727,3
64727,"Cannot wrap around twice as shown, but will do just fine.",64727,3
64728,"If the top was in proportion with the rest of the suit, I would give it a 5 star review.",64728,3
64728,"But I have a DD chest and the top of the suit needs to be almost twice the cup size to cover, there was as much side boob as there was cleavage.",64728,3
64728,"I ordered a size large, but cup was not big enough.",64728,3
64728,Definitely doesn't have a cup side anywhere near what the picture is showing.,64728,3
64728,Suit was well made and soft.,64728,3
64729,"This dress is really cute, but it's too short to wear as anything but a pool cover up.",64729,3
64729,I wish it was a bit longer so my butt didn't fall out when I bend at all.,64729,3
64730,"Gives nice heal cushion, but not really much for arch support.",64730,3
64730,I have normal arches and this doesn't have enough arch support to help my plantar fasciitis at all.,64730,3
64730,"I, like other reviewers, can't stand that this is a 3/4 length insole.",64730,3
64730,"Are you supposed to take the original insole out, leave it in???",64730,3
64730,It's uncomfortable ether way as you can feel it in there and it will move around throughout the day.,64730,3
64730,I really wish they would have made this full length.,64730,3
64730,It would have made a great 'normal' insole.,64730,3
64730,"Doesn't do much for the plantar issue, but it is a cushy heal protection.",64730,3
64731,"they run a little larger,so they're for a thicker build.but would be nice if they fit.",64731,3
64733,"LOOKS GOOD AND ITS BEAUTIFUL, JUST A LITTLE TOO SHORT.",64733,3
64734,It took forever to get the dress (it came from China!,64734,3
64734,"), and when it got here, it doesn't look like quite the same dress.",64734,3
64734,"I ordered the blue, because I liked the neckline better than the other colors, but it turned out they are all the same.",64734,3
64734,"If the dress weren't so inexpensive, I would return it.",64734,3
64736,Wasn't stitched properly there was loose threads all over that I had to snip off.,64736,3
64736,"It's cute but a little short since I'm 5'8"" I would love it if it was longer",64736,3
64739,Very pretty makes a beautiful sound when you walk but it looks kinda cheap and it broke very easily like the same day I got it,64739,3
64740,To heavy on the foot,64740,3
64741,Looked nice at first until the painted-on colors began to peel off.,64741,3
64741,Two stones fell out too.,64741,3
64742,"I really like this item, and I bought it for my Dad for his birthday.",64742,3
64742,"He is unable to use it, because its too stiff.",64742,3
64742,"If you are looking to just hold a small amount of cash, I think this will be ok, but to hold cash and a few credit cards, it doesnt work.",64742,3
64742,It doesnt move enough to get your items into it... Bummer.,64742,3
64742,It is made well other than it is too small to really use realistically.,64742,3
64743,The sizing is not according to USA sizing and large is like a size 8,64743,3
64744,"fits nice, ALWAYS COMES UNHOOKED.",64744,3
64745,Very cute cotton top.,64745,3
64745,"It runs very small, at least two sizes",64745,3
64746,"I ordered this dress true to size and the fit is perfect, but way too short to wear as a dress.",64746,3
64746,It's also too long to wear shorts with so its this awkward length that I can't figure out how to wear it.,64746,3
64746,"Also, I'm 5'6 so average height.",64746,3
64746,If your 5'2 or shorter then I think it would fit well as a dress for you.,64746,3
64747,Bought it for a friend.,64747,3
64747,His job is very dusty and he needs a zipper wallet to keep the abrasive dust off of his credit cards.,64747,3
64747,This wallet did not keep the dust out as well as others.,64747,3
64747,The teeth on the zipper are too big.,64747,3
64747,Other than that it works like a wallet should.,64747,3
64748,"Beautiful colors and breathable material, but the L is definitely a medium and the XL is a Large.",64748,3
64748,I wish they had XXL when I ordered because I want to be comfortable with a sport bra underneath.,64748,3
64748,Also I ordered all XL and they gave me one L and two XL.,64748,3
64748,So my order was uneven.,64748,3
64748,"For reference, I am full-figured, 5' 8' , size 14, medium chested.",64748,3
64749,it was inexpensive .and it looks okay,64749,3
64750,Mine did come in a Chamilia box and looks great!,64750,3
64750,"Edited to add:
Problem is, the jump ring on the top, holding the Chamilia ""tag"" was too big to fit through a genuine Chamilia bead!",64750,3
64750,I had to cut off the jump ring/tag.,64750,3
64751,Daughter likes it very much.,64751,3
64752,Smaller around the thighs but still comfortable.,64752,3
64753,my daughter looks so adorable in it.!,64753,3
64754,"Very lightweight and works well when a light tee shirt isn't enough, but a sweater is too much.",64754,3
64755,One of the bags pockets was sewn incorrectly leaving a big hole in the bag.,64755,3
64756,one strand of bracelet broke b4 even wearing it,64756,3
64757,"too big for me, I received a large but wear medium.",64757,3
64757,Washed it but did not shrink too much.,64757,3
64757,"Will wear a tank top under, other than that its a nice shirt!",64757,3
64758,It is good dress but it is running too small,64758,3
64759,They run small and the fabric is not very soft.,64759,3
64759,Very cute prints though!,64759,3
64760,I bought this for NYE but didn't end up wearing it due to the fabric.,64760,3
64760,The fabric reminds me of a Halloween costume- stretchy and not put together well.,64760,3
64760,Looks like I'll be a witch this year for Halloween :),64760,3
64761,"For the price, this watch is ultimately a beautiful piece and compliments my wardrobe very well.",64761,3
64761,"However, one thing I was disappointed in was after about a good three months the strap broke on this watch and even though I was able to purchase another from a watch repair shop it kind of just made me upset that it broke just after three months.",64761,3
64761,"Other than that, this watch is really nice and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something simple yet, opulent.",64761,3
64762,Great bookbag strong and durable but the picture gets dirty quickly and the stains don't come right out but other than that its a good buy,64762,3
64763,also color not what i expected.,64763,3
64764,"Cute, but has no tummy support.",64764,3
64765,color was not as stated,64765,3
64766,I bought this dress for my daughter to wear for halloween.,64766,3
64766,I washed the dress and the brown looks like it has been washed many times.,64766,3
64766,It is fader and she hasn't even worn it yet!,64766,3
64767,Very thin material but did the job.,64767,3
64767,"Im 5'5, 130 pounds and the small was just right.",64767,3
64768,Doesn't feel or smell like my other lambskin purse.,64768,3
64768,"Strap is definitely ""pleather.""",64768,3
64768,"Cost was a bit high, but I wanted it, so I bought it.",64768,3
64768,Hopefully it will hold up.,64768,3
64768,The chain is not long to use as a handle and it was twisted in two places where links were not doubled.,64768,3
64768,It's too much trouble to send back.,64768,3
64768,Keeping my fingers crossed.,64768,3
64769,Fits Iike a regular exercise shirt though it is a little short on me because I have a long torso.,64769,3
64770,Fit is WAAAAAAAYYYYY off.,64770,3
64770,The bottoms were ok but the top was made for like an A or B cup and I ordered an XXL because I am a D cup.,64770,3
64770,I ordered the next size up to see if that makes a difference.,64770,3
64770,It's a pretty inexpensive suit so it's not a huge loss if it doesn't work.,64770,3
64771,A smaller size would not be available at the time we needed it.,64771,3
64772,Nice quality but way too small,64772,3
64773,measurements in the comments section are way off.,64773,3
64773,Love the shirt but had to order a larger size despite the measurements provided in the description portion.,64773,3
64773,Not as long and loose as pictured.,64773,3
64773,DO NOT wash in machine even in cold water.,64773,3
64773,This is a dry clean only.... do not follow washing directions on tag,64773,3
64776,Material isn't quite I expected but it's still a very nice blouse.,64776,3
64776,I have to be careful to not dry it too.,64776,3
64778,Wasn't purple at all.,64778,3
64778,Got to match the wedding colors but it was all pink.,64778,3
64779,"I'm 5'7 120lbs and have smaller breasts, 32B's (kinda).",64779,3
64779,The bottoms are soo tiny!,64779,3
64779,And I mean that as in the front part of the bikini is so itty bitty it hardly covers my... business in the front.,64779,3
64779,But the top is really really cute and fits well.,64779,3
64780,It like the ring well enough although the color is a bit too shiny.,64780,3
64780,The problem is only after a few days one of the tiny diamond like stones fell out.,64780,3
64782,"This dress runs SUPER small, but the customer service was incredible.",64782,3
64782,I usually wear a medium and the medium fit like an extra small.,64782,3
64782,Just wanted to warn you.,64782,3
64783,cute but arrived kind of damaged,64783,3
64784,I thought the shoulder strap was tan.,64784,3
64784,Like 70s disco gold.,64784,3
64784,The chevron design is pretty.,64784,3
64784,This purse would be better with a tan strap.,64784,3
64784,I feel like such a goof-ball with this gold strap.,64784,3
64785,I'm Miriam sizes..but for mi this blouse is like x small.,64785,3
64786,"This product does not have any tag and I don't think it is linen or, if it is, is not a very good quality of linen.",64786,3
64786,However it is ok for the price I paid.,64786,3
64786,the design is cute and it fits me properly (note that I am a very small person which normally fits size 00 short).,64786,3
64786,This shirt is something that you can wear everyday on a jeans.,64786,3
64786,Surely it is not for an important occasion.,64786,3
64786,It will look very cheap for it.,64786,3
64786,I did not wash it yet and i don't know what will happen when I do it.,64786,3
64788,"My daughter likes them, but they were broke once taken out of the box.",64788,3
64788,The clilaconoe nose pads that rest on the nose broke.,64788,3
64788,She never got to wear them.,64788,3
64789,"I'm giving this 3 stars, because, even though it is EXACTLY like the picture and so, SO soft, it ripped just underneath the collar the very first time my stepdaughter wore it.",64789,3
64789,":(
It ripped in such a way that I'm not sure it can be salvaged, since it's right underneath the collar in a long tear.",64789,3
64789,"If it hadn't ripped, and on the first day without provocation -- she just wore it to her office job -- then I would give it more stars because it's exactly what I'd ordered and it fit perfectly.",64789,3
64790,"So small I gave it to my 8 year old niece lol
But fabric and make are great.",64790,3
64791,A bit dull for the women's ring.,64791,3
64791,The sizing was off at least on digit in both men's and women's rings.,64791,3
64791,We had to return them and replacements were not available.,64791,3
64792,"Nice but the chain links weren't solid, they had splits in them.",64792,3
64792,Mine was too long so I just cut 4links of and crimped clos e the ring that holds clasp to chain ( which also was split.,64792,3
64792,For the p rice they are descent.,64792,3
64793,"This dress was WAY small, my daughter is a size 8 and based on their size Chart and XL should have fit, my size 7 daughter, NOPE!",64793,3
64793,"Material is soft and seems to be well constructed, but beware of sizing",64793,3
64794,Jacket was nice but did not run true to the size.,64794,3
64795,Otherwise they are cute,64795,3
64796,The shirt is still cute but it's terribly undersized.,64796,3
64796,I'm in the smaller size of plus sized and this is too small.,64796,3
64796,"It's a good thing I have a teenager who confiscated it, otherwise it would be returned.",64796,3
64797,Kept in hopes that I'll lose enough weight to wear; watch out when buying products that are manufactured in China,64797,3
64798,My son loved these.,64798,3
64798,However they didn't hold up too well.,64798,3
64798,Within 4 months both the zippers for the pockets had ripped away from the pant.,64798,3
64798,He didn't wear them a lot.,64798,3
64798,I'd say maybe once every 2 weeks.,64798,3
64798,He wore for basketball or to lounge around the house.,64798,3
64798,Wouldn't expect them to last a long time.,64798,3
64801,Super cute and soft material I ordered for maternity pictures unfortunately even being 30 weeks pregnant the medium was still too big.,64801,3
64801,The top was really tight but he arms and waist area were really loose.,64801,3
64802,I loved the shirt but it was way smaller than I expected.,64802,3
64802,The seller is awesome though and worked with me very well to resolve my issue.,64802,3
64803,I really loved the set.,64803,3
64803,The handle screw came off the first day dislocating the handle.,64803,3
64803,"I was able to fix it, but you should need too.",64803,3
64803,So watch those tiny screws,64803,3
64804,They are Somewhat Small AND Somewhat Large.,64804,3
64804,"Loose around the waist but tight enough on the hips that the pockets gap, but tight on the calf, although the seat sags a bit before ever sitting in them.",64804,3
64804,And they are too long for capris.,64804,3
64804,"If you are apple shaped with slender legs, these might work for you, they are an odd fit on me.",64804,3
64804,"As someone who sews, I'm on the fence as to whether to tweak the fit, or send them back.",64804,3
64804,"The fabric is not great quality, I'd be surprised if they survived the current season if I keep them.",64804,3
64805,Not too great on quality.,64805,3
64805,"Fits well, just not what I was looking for.",64805,3
64806,"Adds a decent layer of warmth for casual temperature changes, from inside to out and back again.",64806,3
64806,Form fitting so they are not detected under pants.,64806,3
64806,Only complaint is that there is absolutely no room in the front for male anatomy.,64806,3
64806,"Constricting in the front, but has enough stretch not to be ""gelding"" when sitting.",64806,3
64807,The had is very study and looks good.,64807,3
64807,However I have a big head and it is too big for me.,64807,3
64807,A woman could wear it over big hair for a night out.,64807,3
64807,If you are just looking for style at the bar it would bee OK but if you want it to fit correct it will be too big,64807,3
64808,This coat is cute for the low price but runs very small.,64808,3
64808,"Made in China as I knew , I ordered the XL and it fits as a M",64808,3
64809,not very comfortable but it is pretty.,64809,3
64810,"Ordered a XXL, and it was more like a Med-Large.",64810,3
64810,It was way off on the size.,64810,3
64810,I will probably return it.,64810,3
64810,The dress looks just like the picture.,64810,3
64810,I just wished it fit.,64810,3
64813,The duplicate divider is not large enough to cove the entire check,64813,3
64814,This is NOT a sweat shirt.,64814,3
64814,This is a long sleeve t-shirt.,64814,3
64814,May be returning it if the gift recipient is unhappy with it.,64814,3
64816,Zipper broke when trying it on...sigh...it's still a month before Halloween.,64816,3
64816,I was trying it on and there's stopping point for the zipper when you unzip it so the clasp just fell off.,64816,3
64816,"I am going to try and get it back on (not worth getting professionally fixed) and if not there's always safety pins for the night, good thing the cape goes well below the butt.",64816,3
64816,"Otherwise costume is cute - I ordered a L but I probably should have gone M (gut said go M but thought what harm if it's too big), it's long in sleeves and very stretchy - forgiving.",64816,3
64816,Kids went nuts when I tried it on so the cool mom factor is still there.,64816,3
64817,"These shoes are very loose, which works for me but is somewhat alarming because my feet are wide and these were still loose although somewhat comfortable, so it worked out.",64817,3
64818,good basic underneath it all tank - but starts to pill up after about a dozen washes,64818,3
64819,Like the top super cute.,64819,3
64819,It does loosen a lot so you must retie the strings often but looks awesome.,64819,3
64819,"My first one came with no liner in breast, but it should have it so I returned and reordered with no problem.",64819,3
64821,Really wanted something more delicate.,64821,3
64821,Posts are also too large.,64821,3
64822,My kid is six and the glasses were a little big.,64822,3
64822,Otherwise they were ok.,64822,3
64823,It was torn in two different spots and the edge is spray glued to the veil,64823,3
64824,the sleeves are too tight and small but the rest is perfect,64824,3
64825,"this socks is NOT FOR Toddlers, im gonna keep it for me and find another socks for my baby (4years)",64825,3
64826,"I was very disappointed because I really liked this piece, but if your over 5'7"" then this will not fit correctly.",64826,3
64826,Be sure to check into the sizes with great attention.,64826,3
64827,It is stinky inside.,64827,3
64827,Latch on outside is hard with one hand.,64827,3
64827,Outside pocket too small for my cellphone.,64827,3
64828,Not as cute in person.,64828,3
64829,"Unfortunately these are tight on me, the cut is also not quite right for the way my bum is shaped, I prefer a bit more coverage.",64829,3
64829,The pattern is super cute though :/,64829,3
64830,"Nice quality, construction, appearance, but could stand to be a little bigger.",64830,3
64830,Normal credit cards need to be forced in.,64830,3
64830,If it were one millimeter larger...5 stars!!,64830,3
64832,Very nice dress however I bought one size bigger and it was still too small.,64832,3
64832,"I also looked like something I would wear to a funeral, instead of out to dinner.",64832,3
64832,My husband and son both did not like it.,64832,3
64832,"I was well made, just not right for me, I returned it without any problem and was given an immediate refund.",64832,3
64833,The material was a lot more flimsy than I expected.,64833,3
64833,But for the price I guess this can be expected.,64833,3
64834,The picture looked better than the actual necklace.,64834,3
64834,The honeycomb print is poor quality and does not look as good as I expected.,64834,3
64835,Just ok. Should be useful.,64835,3
64837,It was ok the material was just ok no big thing.,64837,3
64838,Material not as expected.,64838,3
64838,Fits more like a small./medium,64838,3
64839,I did not like the material,64839,3
64841,I think the medium fits more like a large.,64841,3
64841,Pretty color and looks well made and I like the shirt otherwise.,64841,3
64841,It is more like a light sweater in heaviness.,64841,3
64843,"size was a bit too small and the material a bit thin, but for the price its a good quality",64843,3
64844,"Its a dull white, looks dirty",64844,3
64845,The material feels nice and the fit is good.,64845,3
64845,The v-neck is a deep plunge which shows cleavage.,64845,3
64845,The reason for three stars is that the yoke pattern is not matched.,64845,3
64845,I would not wear this out in public.,64845,3
64845,And the cost of shipping this back is more than what I paid for it.,64845,3
64845,So I wear this at home for a quick cover up on a hot day.,64845,3
64846,Top a lil tight.,64846,3
64846,All together it's very cute though.,64846,3
64847,advertised size smaller than actual,64847,3
64848,"These are lovely, but they fall apart very easily.",64848,3
64849,"The bottom's fit perfectly, the top however was very small.",64849,3
64849,I wish you could buy in separate sizes,64849,3
64850,My daughter is a medium and this is an Xlarge and it still fit her small!!,64850,3
64851,I took the large and i found it like 3XL .. Material is not bad .. Design is not that great and the color is more bright than the photo .. Im gonna give it to a friend,64851,3
64852,Difficult to hook all the hooks,64852,3
64853,I like it and the price is what it's worth.,64853,3
64855,Too small on the calf but sure cute,64855,3
64856,"Nice looking and we'll made but only one pocket fits my phone
And that's a squeeze.",64856,3
64856,It stated it fit my type of phone.,64856,3
64856,I will use it anyway.,64856,3
64856,Fir smaller phones I suppose it would be great,64856,3
64857,It looked like the picture in terms of the print and the trim.,64857,3
64857,However the size was a bit small (I bought another similar dress by a different company and that one fit MUCH better!),64857,3
64857,What I liked: the print is beautiful.,64857,3
64857,"What I did not like:
1.",64857,3
64857,"The neckline plunged to below my bust line... Now I know we Caribbean girls dress for the heat, but that's no reason to have everything hang out!",64857,3
64857,"*shudder*
Having said that, thus would be a good cover up for the beach.",64857,3
64858,Nice t-shirt but the material is too heavy.,64858,3
64859,Actually loved the dress but couldn't put it on.,64859,3
64859,Didn't realize it was Asian sized.,64859,3
64860,You said they run small...but they run really small.,64860,3
64860,"Also, I bought the same shirt in three different colors and each shirt had a different feel to the material.",64860,3
64860,They did not seem consistently made.,64860,3
64860,I really like this style of shirt but am having trouble finding the perfect one.,64860,3
64861,The buttons are the best but still love the outfit.,64861,3
64862,This was good though the rope for the cross was much bigger than the other ropes so it didn't sit right on my wrist.,64862,3
64863,"So far, they have been wonderful for preventing blisters during my training runs.",64863,3
64863,I'll let you know if they prevent them during my half marathon in a week in a half.,64863,3
64863,They do have a somewhat thick seam at the toes which I don't like.,64863,3
64865,"I'm 5'4, 140lbs and a 36C.",64865,3
64865,I bought an extra large and it just fits.,64865,3
64865,If I throw it in the dryer it probably won't.,64865,3
64865,"The quality is to be expected, it's a T shirt.",64865,3
64865,I'm just surprised it's so small.,64865,3
64866,LOOks like clear stone but wasn't .,64866,3
64866,very dark & marbled.,64866,3
64866,Too large for teenage granddaughter ; disappointed,64866,3
64867,Purchased about a month ago and all the inside lining is falling apart.,64867,3
64867,Very pretty purse but cheaply made and absolutely doesn't last long,64867,3
64868,"I ordered my size, and they are about 4-6 inches to big around the waist",64868,3
64869,"Really cute, but a little too big especially in the arms.",64869,3
64869,"Also there is no lining in the chest, which I don't feel comfortable with.",64869,3
64869,It did look super cute on other than that.,64869,3
64870,These laces have a tendency to fray and have the weave come apart.,64870,3
64870,I'd expected a slightly higher quality,64870,3
64871,"Nice material, good fit for my wife but the waistband twist in the waistline of the pants but over all pleased!",64871,3
64872,I like the blouse but it runs larger than I had expected.,64872,3
64873,"This necklace is pretty, but it is Cheap!",64873,3
64874,Colors differ from the picture,64874,3
64875,"I bought these specifically for a costume and I would wear them again if another costume came up that I could use them for, but definitely not as everyday wear.",64875,3
64875,It felt like I was walking on a board.,64875,3
64875,"The first hour wasn't bad but I started getting sores on my feet from the rubbing and by the time I left, I could barely walk.",64875,3
64875,"I would probably try to avoid them if I was going to the same function, but if it was a house party or something with little to no walking, I would consider using them as part of a costume.",64875,3
64875,"For what I wanted them for, they were fine, but if you're hoping to find something you could wear everyday, these are not the way to go.",64875,3
64876,"Lovely product, but the lg/xl  has the fit of a medium.",64876,3
64876,I had to send it back; too bad they don't have a true XL size.,64876,3
64877,Otherwise material feels comfy,64877,3
64878,I love the style of it and think it's very beautiful.,64878,3
64878,But it's cheaply made and broke very quickly.,64878,3
64879,"Very nice but it runs small, necklaces refuses to lay flat around my neck.",64879,3
64879,But fits my 8 year old beautifully lol still waiting on a response on how to get my $ back,64879,3
64880,"The linen is beautiful, the workmanship is excellent and the colors are great.",64880,3
64880,Next time I order I am calling the seller so that I might get a good fit.,64880,3
64880,The style was not very becoming on me.,64880,3
64881,Bottoms a little small... top fits a little weird but for the price it was close to what I expected and I still like the top a lot to wear with other bottoms...,64881,3
64882,Not quite what I expected.,64882,3
64882,Ran a bit small,64882,3
64883,"I had previously purchased from this brand and loved the product, works so much better then pampers swim diapers.",64883,3
64883,They are not as dificult to pull off when wet.,64883,3
64883,However I had to return these as I ordered a size 3T and when it arrived it fits like a 2T.,64883,3
64883,I even held it up to last years swim trunks and it was the same size (2T).,64883,3
64883,Upon checking the label it states 2T-3T that size range is too wide ranged for growing kids.,64883,3
64883,They need to be two different sizes available.,64883,3
64883,On the listing it states just size 3T.,64883,3
64884,I ordered this jacket to wear to a 5K I was running when the weather report turned to rain.,64884,3
64884,"It wasn't a downpour, but a steady drizzle and the jacket did keep me dry.",64884,3
64884,"It was large for me....I am 5'4"" and 130 lbs.",64884,3
64884,"The sleeves have elastic at the cuffs, so even though they were very long, I was able to just push them up and they didn't annoy me.",64884,3
64884,"My big complaint with this jacket is the three zippers.....two nice big zippered pockets, and the front zipper which I thought would be more convenient than a pullover.",64884,3
64884,EVERY ZIPPER got snagged on some fabric and got stuck.,64884,3
64884,"After the first one, I was very conscious to be careful zipping or unzipping, but they still got caught.",64884,3
64884,I'm not sure how often I will use this jacket for that reason.,64884,3
64884,"It does fold down very small and store in its only little bag, so it would be nice for travel if I can figure out how to avoid the zipper issue.",64884,3
64885,Very nice set but pants are too small (width) but length is fine.,64885,3
64885,Unfortunately I will have to return this adorable PJ set.,64885,3
64887,"Not true to size, my daughter loves them but after a week some of the lights didn't work  ,which has her frustrated",64887,3
64888,"Beautiful shirt, loved the look of it.",64888,3
64888,"However, sizing seemed to run smaller than expected.",64888,3
64889,"The skirt was a little small but I figured that because I have wider hips, but the top was way too big, it didn't tie in the front like I expected, the tie was secure.",64889,3
64889,"I use the skirt still, but had to give the shirt away.",64889,3
64889,Maybe for girls with bigger boobs.,64889,3
64890,"Cute top, just runs a bit small, even with the stretch.",64890,3
64890,"I usually wear a size small, I'd actually consider a medium or large depending on how you like a fit.",64890,3
64891,The shoulder width was extremely small.,64891,3
64891,"The seem that should have fallen just off the end of my shoulder, sat in the middle of my shoulder.",64891,3
64891,Probably going have to go Larry the Cable Guy with this shirt and wear a cardigan over it!,64891,3
64892,Seemed more like night gown.,64892,3
64892,"Thought it would be shorter since I'm on the taller side (5'6 140lbs), however came to the top of my knees.",64892,3
64892,"Maybe if I add a belt to accessorize it, it'll look better.",64892,3
64893,the fabric feels a bit thin but it's a good hoodie besides the occasional lint pills that stick to the wings,64893,3
64894,The waist is tight as it should to cinch your waist but after awhile the wiring kills your back.,64894,3
64894,I have to rest a day after after wearing it.,64894,3
64895,"PRODUCT IS SEE THRU,  I CAN ONLY USE IT AS A SLEEPING SHIRT....GOOD SIDE, MY HUSBAND HAS NO COMPLAINTS..",64895,3
64896,Was much larger globe than expected and the dandelion seeds were dirty and had other stuff like leaf peices in it  .,64896,3
64896,I ordered 3 and I personally feel only one is giftable.,64896,3
64896,Would have been better if I could have assembled it myself.,64896,3
64896,On one I can see where the glue driped on the side.,64896,3
64897,Not exactly the quality of fabric I was anticipating but it will do for an knit shirt.,64897,3
64897,Seems the sizes run slightly smaller because the Large fits more like a Medium.,64897,3
64898,"too thin, otherwise they are fine.",64898,3
64900,"It's a see through shirt, doesn't look like the picture.",64900,3
64900,If ordering this shirt order your Asian size which would be about 2 sizes larger.,64900,3
64901,Read over the reviews before ordering.,64901,3
64901,Got a 3T and it fits my son who is currently in 24 months and some 2T.,64901,3
64901,Took a few weeks to arrive.,64901,3
64902,I am ordering other one in larger size now.,64902,3
64903,"It was bigger than I expected, but 100% cotton so I tried to shrink it, which helped a little.",64903,3
64903,The sleeves are too short.,64903,3
64903,It only looks good if I scrunch them up.,64903,3
64903,It's pretty thin too.,64903,3
64903,I guess I was expecting more of a sweatshirt thickness.,64903,3
64903,"Overall, I like it enough.",64903,3
64904,It looks fake just because its so chunky.,64904,3
64904,It does not look graceful or classy.,64904,3
64904,It looks big and loud,64904,3
64905,I was looking for a wallet in which I can carry my credit card and also my iphone 6s.,64905,3
64905,The size and pockets are perfect but the smell of the wallet itself is horrible.,64905,3
64905,I tried to use it for a week but after the week I gave up.,64905,3
64905,It have this plasticy fishy smell.,64905,3
64906,Not white - dark cream colored in center.,64906,3
64906,Wish it was whiter.,64906,3
64906,Qualify fabric and nicely  made.,64906,3
64908,It's an okay shirt.,64908,3
64908,Just wasn't what I expected.,64908,3
64909,"You can sort of see it from the picture, but the shoulders don't extend much past the torso.",64909,3
64909,"Maybe that was the intention, but it didn't really work for me.",64909,3
64910,Don't huge my body as I thought and I ordered a small,64910,3
64911,Nice bright red color but skirt is on the wider side.,64911,3
64911,Ordered a Medium and it fits loose on my hips.,64911,3
64911,I'll have to use safety pins when I wear it.,64911,3
64912,"For the fans of ASSC, this T-shirt will look just like those real ones if you see them from far away.",64912,3
64912,"But, if you see them closely, you will see that the letters are actually stickers.",64912,3
64912,If you wear them and wash them they will tear off sooner or later as you can see in the photo.,64912,3
64912,"Also, the T-shirt itself is a bit low quality (see through under lights).",64912,3
64913,they are tight in the inner thigh/crotch area.,64913,3
64913,would have gone up a size.,64913,3
64914,Cute but the ears look nothing like in the picture.,64914,3
64914,More pointy and Fox looking than cat ears.,64914,3
64914,Sadly had to return but they are very easy to work with!,64914,3
64915,Pretty cool but hurts my giant head,64915,3
64917,I'm not sure how to describe this shirt.,64917,3
64917,It's both too big and too small for me.,64917,3
64917,It's very wide and square.,64917,3
64917,I was under the impression this was supposed to be a shirt and not a crop top.,64917,3
64917,The shirt is so wide it constantly is falling off my shoulders.,64917,3
64917,And that would be okay but it's so short too and it makes me feel uncomfortable.,64917,3
64917,It's still cute so it's not a complete failure but not what I wanted and not what was advertised.,64917,3
64918,Cheaply made and looks it.,64918,3
64918,What did I expect for such a low price?,64918,3
64919,ears kind of small but headband fits great.,64919,3
64919,they are a little flimsy though.,64919,3
64920,"This dress is comfortable, but huge.",64920,3
64920,"The straps are really long at the shoulder, so I've had to tie knots in them to keep my chest from being randomly exposed.",64920,3
64921,It is not enough fabric to cover sides.,64921,3
64922,I obviously ordered these gauges for the fun pictures.,64922,3
64922,One pair that I loved broke.,64922,3
64922,I was barely screwing the back on and it basically stripped it.,64922,3
64922,Was disappointed but I still had 5 other pairs to choose from with amazing pictures ;),64922,3
64923,Didn't like it have a cloth tie,64923,3
64924,Too small across the breast area and not as long as I would have like.,64924,3
64925,Material nice and soft.,64925,3
64925,Pants smaller than expected.,64925,3
64926,These are more like a corduroy than ribbed.,64926,3
64926,Not quite as I expected but they fit pretty well so I kept them.,64926,3
64927,"Beautiful dress, but the sizing must be off.",64927,3
64927,"I ordered a size larger than I usually do just in case, and I couldn't even zip it up.",64927,3
64927,"The underlayer of the dress is not a stretchy fabric, so even if I could have zipped it up, I think it would have been restricting and uncomfortable.",64927,3
64928,"They were a bit more narrow than expected, but they're for a costume and will still work perfectly fine.",64928,3
64928,"Also, it's as was described, so really, the narrowness is a failing on my part.",64928,3
64928,"They did have an awful, synthetic smell to them coming out of the packaging.",64928,3
64928,I had to let them 'air out' for a few days before it went away.,64928,3
64929,"This is a sturdy bracelet and will hold any hair tie, the only problem is that I mistakenly ordered a large and it is way too big for my wrist (I have an average sized wrist).",64929,3
64929,"Having said that, if you have large wrists this would not be too small like many ""large"" bracelets that do run small.",64929,3
64929,"The bracelet is also a bit heavy, but again very durable.",64929,3
64929,Another thing I liked is that the photo is a great depiction of the actual item.,64929,3
64929,The edges are very angular and if you prefer rounded edges this is not for you.,64929,3
64929,I will be giving this away to someone who can use it.,64929,3
64931,Although it is very lightweight material it has a nice shine to it.,64931,3
64931,"For being so cheap, it's a good product.",64931,3
64932,sleeves have a permanent crease in them that makes them pointy,64932,3
64933,Product is pretty but my package only came with one stocking.,64933,3
64934,"It fits snug and the chains are much closer to being the sane length, so they don't sit as nicely as it shows in the photo.",64934,3
64935,Fits a little smaller than ones I bought before,64935,3
64936,"I wear a medium, I order a medium based on the reviews, this dress looked great but the fit was to small!",64936,3
64936,I have to return it for a refund!,64936,3
64937,Large fit like a medium.,64937,3
64938,The color for the umbrella is gorgeous.,64938,3
64938,Unfortunately I had been looking at other similar products & thought this was one of the umbrellas that folded smaller but it doesn't.,64938,3
64938,It is handy because it opens inside out for getting in/out of the car and provides a lot of coverage.,64938,3
64938,"It is long, though so does not store easily in the car or my bag.",64938,3
64938,It is pretty & does the job.,64938,3
64939,The nose holder part fail off at 3rd week .. anyway it's good for this price,64939,3
64940,These pants are very comfortable and I love the colors.,64940,3
64940,Great for working out in.,64940,3
64940,"My only complaint is due to the material, the pants keep wanting to fall down.",64940,3
64940,"It's kind of a stretch material and silky feeling, so it tends to ride down.",64940,3
64941,It's ok but looks even cheaper than I thought.,64941,3
64942,The material of the shirt is not stretchable so u have to be careful when u put it on but it's nice,64942,3
64943,"My mom loved it as a gift, but after only a month the magnet part broke where it allowed the flap (part with turquoise) to stick and keep purse closed.",64943,3
64945,tight at the neck,64945,3
64946,"These are the cutest and look awesome on the foot but run small,  had to reorder in larger size and the big toe still was hitting the shoe uncomfortably,  never had that problem before.",64946,3
64946,Will keep and try to make work because they really are so cute.,64946,3
64949,They run a little small.,64949,3
64951,This is just ok.,64951,3
64951,The picture makes it seem very flattering but the way its made is off.,64951,3
64951,There is a bit of extra material in certain areas as if this bathing suit wasn't made correctly.,64951,3
64951,It seems to be aligned incorrectly  where certain ares of the material don't lay flat and just stay in a small bulge/crease.,64951,3
64951,"the straps also fit oddly, the back opening doesn't lay flat on the body, the material on this sides of the back flare out.",64951,3
64951,It is cut like an ordinary once piece bathing suit full coverage on the but.,64951,3
64951,"Overall, it's poorly made and an odd fit.",64951,3
64952,My daughter loves this skirt.,64952,3
64952,3 stars due to the fact that after 1 day worn and 1 wash it's already looking worn.,64952,3
64953,I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT PURCHASING THIS ITEM NOW THAT I HAVE IT AMLIKE OKKKKK NOT SO EXCITED.,64953,3
64953,TOP FITS OKAY IF YOU TIE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE.,64953,3
64953,(I GUESS THAT HOW IT WAS MADE TO BE ROCKED).,64953,3
64953,I HAVE SMALL BOOBS (VICTORIA SECRET SIZE : 34C) SO IT MAKES ME LOOK LITTLE FULL  SO ITS NOT BAD.,64953,3
64953,BUT THE BOTTOM FITS REALLY TIGHT.,64953,3
64953,"( I DO HAVE A LITTLE BUTT) I NORMALLY ORDER A MEDIUM AND IT FITS LIKE AN X SMALL,(I AM 150 LBS 5FT 10INCHES , ON THE TALL SIDE) BUT THE SWIMSUIT  DOES NOT FIT LIKE A MEDIUM.SINCE THE BOTTOM IS SO TIGHT THE STRAP RUNNING FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP JUST LOOK WIERD, LIKE YOU WEARING YOUR BABY SISTER'S SWIM SUIT BOTTOM.",64953,3
64953,I BELIEVE IN REVIEWS SO AM TRYING TO BE HONEST HERE ALSO THATS HOW I DETERMINE IF TO ACTUALLY ORDER ITEMS ESP ON AMAZON.,64953,3
64953,SO IF YOU HAVE A HUGE BUTT AND SMALL TOP I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT SWIMSUIT FOR YOU.,64953,3
64953,HOWEVER IF U HAVE A SMALL BUTT LIKE AVERAGE SIZE AND WEAR 34 C AND UP YOU CAN RISK A MEDIUM BUT SINCE THE BOTTOM RUNS SMALL FOR COMFORT I WOULD SAY A LARGE.,64953,3
64953,THEN AGAIN YOU CAN ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK LOL.,64953,3
64954,Item is way to small.,64954,3
64954,From reading other people's reviews it seemed as though some thought it was true to size but not the case for me.,64954,3
64954,"I'm 5'3 and normally wear a small in tops and med in bottoms this ""dress"" was a tank top on me I don't think an XL would have gone past my thighs.",64954,3
64954,Other than that it was a cute a shirt,64954,3
64956,I like it but washed it once and already has a hole in it.,64956,3
64957,Made my fingers green.,64957,3
64958,This is for a wedding and will likely only be worn once but it literally just fits.,64958,3
64958,I ordered a 3T and my son currently wears a 2T.,64958,3
64958,I had to loosen the suspenders as far as they go so it will fit him.,64958,3
64958,I suggest ordering 2 sizes up.,64958,3
64959,Prettier than i expected but arrived on time and is really nice just look fake but hey it was cheap,64959,3
64960,"I do not like the this style, they fit smaller than the high-cuts, and I'm constantly pulling on them to get them to go higher than they are meant to.",64960,3
64961,Item came well packaged but was smaller than described.,64961,3
64962,Thin shirt but nice,64962,3
64963,the shirt rides up when I run and is uncomfortable,64963,3
64964,"Nice design, material feels nice but sizing runs a little small",64964,3
64965,i love the design its simple yet elegant however its small for an xl,64965,3
64966,It's a little on the small side.,64966,3
64966,I was kind of expecting the material to be lighter than it is.,64966,3
64966,It's a dense fabric.,64966,3
64966,living in florida I don't think ill be able to wear this out much during the summer,64966,3
64968,Not what I expected I wearing a dress and it makes my very round bottom look like sponge bobs but I hate it.,64968,3
64968,Sad I can't wear it during the day.,64968,3
64968,I will wear in the night only.,64968,3
64969,These are super cute but seemed to have broken at the seems.,64969,3
64969,Lasted 2 girls night outs.,64969,3
64970,"Overall romper is very cute, its complete rip off of a romper made by BCBGMAZAZARIA which retailed for $350+ which is why I got this one but over the fit is VERY small.",64970,3
64970,"I ordered a size large and I am typically an XS and 5'7"".",64970,3
64970,Seams do not match up but for $10 you get what you pay for.,64970,3
64971,Does not provide support.,64971,3
64971,"But, what else can you get for these much dollars!",64971,3
64972,The actual garment was muchh smaller than I expected (I ordered a XX-L) and it didn't come with the thigh-high stockings.,64972,3
64972,"It was just the top garment, the garters hanging from it, and the thong.",64972,3
64972,"The garment is also much shorter than I anticipated, as it just reaches my belly button.",64972,3
64973,they were smaller than i had hoped they'd be.,64973,3
64974,Much darker than expected on the navy blue version.,64974,3
64975,Sexy & do run 1-2 sizes smaller (because made in China) so order up.,64975,3
64977,This shirt is ok but I wouldn't buy it again.,64977,3
64977,It doesn't seem very well made.,64977,3
64977,It doesn't stretch well.,64977,3
64978,"Very nice fabric, but one size does not fit all.",64978,3
64978,"I wear between a 12 and 14, depending on the brand, and this was too tight for my liking.",64978,3
64978,It fit more like tights- I really had to shimmy into them.,64978,3
64978,"I ended up giving them to my daughter, who only weighs 78 pounds.",64978,3
64978,"They are a little loose on her, but comfy.",64978,3
64979,"These are great pants, and the fleecy inside does make them more comfortable than your average sweatpants.",64979,3
64979,"However the lack of pockets is a huge issue, at least for me.",64979,3
64979,"They're sweatpants, not a formalwear, would including something useful like pockets really be that hard?",64979,3
64980,Definitely way smaller than expected.,64980,3
64980,Even after ordering two sizes up.,64980,3
64980,"It just fits, but I wanted it to be much bigger and drape down more.",64980,3
64980,"Cute cardigan, very soft.",64980,3
64980,Would have given 5 stars had it actually felt like an XXL.,64980,3
64980,Just felt like a regular small cardigan.,64980,3
64981,It's nice but the back split is butt high and wide..,64981,3
64982,"Noisy metal, possibly silver.....?!",64982,3
64983,But if it have a biger size it will be great,64983,3
64984,Nice lined and warm,64984,3
64986,"Way to small, but material is very nice.",64986,3
64986,"If you normally wear a 2XL, get bigger.",64986,3
64986,This item was not available in 3XL.,64986,3
64987,"Lace is very high quality however the other fabric is not, makes it feel cheap instead of comfy with a touch of elegance.",64987,3
64988,Nice quality but runs smalls to size,64988,3
64989,I like it but it is shorter than I wanter it to be.,64989,3
64990,This is a tighter fitting shirt and rather thin material.,64990,3
64990,It said hand wash and hang dry in the tag which I missed if it was in the description.,64990,3
64990,I will save it and use it for layering under a sweater but more than likely not wear it this summer.,64990,3
64990,It's not as flowy as the picture.,64990,3
64990,It is extremely soft though so I'm sure it will be very comfy.,64990,3
64992,The piece is very attractive.,64992,3
64992,"However, as the price indicates, it is cheap.",64992,3
64992,The chain was not well glued into the clasp so it fell off after the first time I wore it.,64992,3
64992,I do have a hot glue gun so I was able to repair it.,64992,3
64992,I fully expect the other side to fall out soon.,64992,3
64992,"That being said, the metal is a heavy durable metal for both the earrings and the chain.",64992,3
64992,"If the necklace didn't fall apart on first use, I would have given it 5 stars.",64992,3
64993,"Cute- People can be so negative on reviews - It's a $6 tank, what do you expect?!",64993,3
64993,I ordered this one and the blue- the only complaint is the pink one does NOT look like the one in the picture.,64993,3
64993,The color is okay- it's more of a salmon color.,64993,3
64993,"I ordered a size small, it is definitely more fitted on me though- I'll hang dry it so it doesn't shrink and lasts longer.",64993,3
64993,"I'm 5'7, 125 lbs.",64993,3
64993,Probably should've gotten a medium but oh well.,64993,3
64993,It's just a casual comfy shirt!,64993,3
64994,"It's beautiful, nice material.",64994,3
64994,But it's not stretchy at all.,64994,3
64994,My 34DDs didn't appreciate that and I couldn't wear a bra at all for it to fit.,64994,3
64994,But I went through ComiCon in it and people loved it.,64994,3
64995,Much smaller than it presents,64995,3
64996,"I like the feel of the shirt, but I am disappointed that it is really too short and snug on the sleeves.",64996,3
64996,"I read that the size was accurate, but it wasn't for me.",64996,3
64996,"I normally wear size small, but I ordered large, and still this problem.",64996,3
64996,Maybe I won't order online anymore.,64996,3
64997,This bra was sooo comfortable and I wanted so much for it to work!,64997,3
64997,"Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the straps are just set too far apart in the back and I constantly feel like they are falling off my shoulders.",64997,3
64997,"I wanted this bra to wear during labor in order to be able to nurse right afterwards, and I couldn't see myself being comfortable in it with the straps as they are.",64997,3
64997,"Other than that issue, the bra was so soft and comfy..so it's very disappointing.",64997,3
64997,It also seemed to run small compared to the provided size chart.,64997,3
64998,Too large for a petite wrist.,64998,3
64999,This scarf looked nothing like the picture.,64999,3
64999,"First of all, it actually came as a bright clown red color when the picture makes it look a burgundy or maroon color.",64999,3
64999,The picture is literally so different!,64999,3
64999,"Lucky for them I'm too lazy to ship it back, so I'll just have to make my bright bright red scarf work with my wardrobe somehow.",64999,3
65000,This bralette fit as expected but requires adjustment from time to time.,65000,3
65000,"However, this lovely design can be worn alone or with a low V-back blouse to add dimension to an outfit.",65000,3
65001,"Lovely blouse but it is small fitting, therefore buy one size bigger than what you normally wear.",65001,3
65002,"They're really cute, kind of cheaply made but what else is to expect from low priced earrings.",65002,3
65002,"I was under the impression that having regular pierced ears would do the job, but the metal part is a lot more thick and will not fit through my earlobe piercing.",65002,3
65002,"Regular earrings have no problem, but these are just too thick, unless you plan on stretching that part of your ear out, I do not suggest them.",65002,3
65004,ok but the skirt is a wrap around and does not fit me like it does the model.,65004,3
65004,if you can do a rubic's cube you might be able to figure out the top's strapping.,65004,3
65005,"Beautiful, elegant and confortable but is little small.",65005,3
65006,I normally wear xl.,65006,3
65006,This xl size is so tight in the arms I couldn't put it on.,65006,3
65007,This fists nice around my back and such.,65007,3
65007,Although in the chest area it is really loose.,65007,3
65007,I wish for a sports bra it was a little more snug.,65007,3
65008,Material was too thick and itchy,65008,3
65009,"Looked good on me but my boobs would literally come out just bending over to pick up something, I wore it around the house when I discovered that, Thank god.",65009,3
65009,I'm a 34 C and I gave it to my friend who is a 34 A and She has no problems and it looks better on her.,65009,3
65010,I want to try the large.,65010,3
65011,Fits ok cheap but can be dressed up,65011,3
65012,"Very Cute & Stretchy but 1 Bow  broke off after 1 use -I able to fix it myself, but just worried how long they will last.",65012,3
65013,The bottom of this tank has a tendency to rise up if you are moving around a lot.,65013,3
65013,I would suggest going up a size.,65013,3
65014,"Not the best material but still good quality, slightly see through,
I love PERSUN and the quality of the clothes.",65014,3
65015,These were cute but were a bit long for my short legs.,65015,3
65017,The 116 shirt runs small I'm 5'0 120 and I ordered my true size (small) it fits but its really snug and I'm afraid if I put it in the dryer it will shrink and I won't be able to fit it at all so I would recommend going a size up for future buyers,65017,3
65018,The dress is well made and lovely.,65018,3
65018,"I received many compliments on it too, despite my discomfort.",65018,3
65018,I'm generally a size 8 with an hour-glass figure.,65018,3
65018,"I ordered a 10 thinking it would be a bit large, but I could use the lace up to cinch it in.",65018,3
65018,However the dress was too small in the hips and bust and too large in the waist.,65018,3
65018,It was also impossible to put on without help.,65018,3
65018,"There is no zipper, only a lace up back with one lace.",65018,3
65018,"It should have two laces to cinch in the waist, otherwise the lace up is just decorative.",65018,3
65018,I was able to wear the dress very uncomfortably and couldn't wait to get it off.,65018,3
65018,The dress has no give and sitting down was almost impossible.,65018,3
65020,It actually looks pretty cheap and is not of the same quality that other necklaces have been.,65020,3
65021,they were a lot smaller then i was expecting and i was not able to fit them on my child.,65021,3
65021,i would recommend  ordering a size bigger,65021,3
65022,Was expecting a more larger one but its okay,65022,3
65023,Very nice just runs really small.,65023,3
65024,I gave it to my son's GF because it was too small.,65024,3
65024,I followed the chart but it was way too small,65024,3
65025,I was a little disappointed in the weight of the chain.,65025,3
65025,"Seems too light weight, but will try it out.",65025,3
65026,It didn't look good on me.,65026,3
65027,good quality but to small,65027,3
65028,"I really love these pants, but they run REALLY, REALLY small.",65028,3
65029,"The glasses are cute, but I got them to wear at night at burningman when it was dusty (but not dusty enough to need full goggles), since they light up & appeared to have clear lenses, plus match my hello kitty onesies & beach cruiser.",65029,3
65029,"Unfortunately, they don't have lenses at all, so I have actually never worn them.",65029,3
65030,I love it but I was hoping it would be a crop top and it would fit tighter.,65030,3
65030,"The adjustable strings at the top help make it fit me, I'm 95 pounds and am a A cup.",65030,3
65031,"I ordered a small and this thing was huge, or maybe the cut is different.",65031,3
65031,it didn't fit anything like the female in the picture.,65031,3
65032,Smaller than expected but still fits well enough to wear as tuck in T.,65032,3
65034,i like it but you need to order like 3 sizes bigger than the size you wear,65034,3
65035,too small for a 14 year old boy,65035,3
65036,"Some of the gloves acquired holes in them after on a few uses/ washes, however when you consider you pay 10.00 for one pair in the store the valie is still good.",65036,3
65037,"Loved the shirt, WAY too small though",65037,3
65039,Pant knees wore out on my 5 year old after 2 months.,65039,3
65040,Looks really cute in person.,65040,3
65040,Biggest gripe is the fur keeps falling off every time I touch it.,65040,3
65040,It's a couple hairs at a time.,65040,3
65040,No problem if you don't expect to wear it much.,65040,3
65040,"If you do want to wear it a lot, I'd try another product.",65040,3
65041,"cute top- not that flattering on but good quality, good service",65041,3
65042,I like it even though its a little bit big for me,65042,3
65044,This was given 3 stars because I ordered a medium and I received a large.,65044,3
65044,Very disappointed in this purchase.,65044,3
65044,Overall it's a nice dress.,65044,3
65045,"Loved the top, but the skirt bottom was way too small for my 2.5 year and I ordered a 3T.",65045,3
65047,Very small for US sizes!,65047,3
65048,I like them but the balls are a pain to get set..,65048,3
65049,after a wash or two the fabric gets kinda ratty,65049,3
65050,the shorts are cute but the sizing was difficult to determine as a result they are little too loose,65050,3
65051,"This is more like a football jersey, the spandex polyester type material, not a normal winter knit, cotton type sweater.",65051,3
65051,"The color is great and you won't have to worry about fading or stretching, because of the material, but it will not keep you warm on a winter day.",65051,3
65052,Sexy but pouch cuts off too soon and string is too long in the back.,65052,3
65053,So I do Like these.,65053,3
65053,They are not the best quality.,65053,3
65053,You will have to sew them a few times.,65053,3
65053,Hand sewing is not enough.,65053,3
65053,you need to have a sewing machine.,65053,3
65053,"After about 2 months I had to restitch them, then they were fine.",65053,3
65053,"Pro Tip, Sew the foot straps on an angle and they will be more comfortable.",65053,3
65053,You just need to use them on the same side every time.,65053,3
65053,You will also have to bend the clips every once in a while to get the tension back on the clips.,65053,3
65053,It can and will rip thin shirt material so be ware of that.,65053,3
65053,Two shirts I love have holes now.,65053,3
65053,"To get around this fold over the bottom of the shirt at least once before inserting in the clip, This way you get more surface tension and the jaws won't just stretch it out as much.",65053,3
65053,Some shirt material will slip right out of the jaws.,65053,3
65053,I its embarrassing to have one slip off when you are trying to pitch to a customer and pop out under your pant leg..... whats even worse is when bolth of them pop off and slide out under your pant leg in the middle of a meeting.,65053,3
65053,"If they would redesign the clip with a locking rod on the top this would not happen, but the clip is only a spring clamp.",65053,3
65053,I do use these just about every day but don't expect them to hold up out of the box.,65053,3
65055,My Daughter  Love It,65055,3
65056,Super small and really tight,65056,3
65057,"nice enough, but not great.",65057,3
65057,"Nice and light, fit well, look good.",65057,3
65057,"A bit of distortion to the lens, a bit flimsy feeling",65057,3
65058,Plastic is cheap and has large ridges from the molding process that were sharp.,65058,3
65059,"Got one and it came broke, but it was $1.55 so I just ordered another one.",65059,3
65060,Fit one size down and the pads were cheaply made,65060,3
65061,Love that it arrived quickly however to be honest the quality of the material is low.,65061,3
65061,Even my granddaughter was not happy with it half of them broke apart where they came together.,65061,3
65062,"I thought these were dyed beads, but they are really only covered with resin.",65062,3
65062,"I am still going to use them, but I will need to be mindful of the color wearing off.",65062,3
65063,Not as large as expected but it is a good bag and delivery time was before expected.,65063,3
65064,"I have a giant head, wearing a 7 3/4"" fitted cap and even then that'll give me a headache over time.",65064,3
65064,I bought this hat for river trips and I'll update after this coming weekend.,65064,3
65064,Initial feelings on the hat - it's very firm.,65064,3
65064,there's no wire in the brim to adjust how it hangs and the hat is a little tight on my mellon.,65064,3
65064,There is a nice elastic band on the interior to take up any slack if you prefer something like that.,65064,3
65064,"My wife tried it on and said it was huge on her... After I sweat it in this weekend, it may fit better.",65064,3
65065,Surprisingly pretty for the unbelievable low price!,65065,3
65066,"Made small get 1 size up, but very cute a little see thru, you can throw a scarf around u to cover better",65066,3
65067,I love the onesie.,65067,3
65067,"Really thought it would be bigger, my son only got to wear it once.",65067,3
65069,The buckle seems thin and hollow.,65069,3
65069,It is plenty strong since it is steel.,65069,3
65069,I like this style of buckle that allows the belt to route under itself which avoids a dangling belt end.,65069,3
65070,"I am in my 9th month, and a size 6 before pregnancy.",65070,3
65070,"While it fits fine, the robe is very snug around my belly.",65070,3
65070,I wish it were a bit more roomy.,65070,3
65071,I find that this is a little overpriced.,65071,3
65072,"Ordered an large becuase reviews said it ran small, I am 5'3 130 lbs and a 36c.",65072,3
65072,The top is way to big and the bottoms are way to small lol so that was a waist.,65072,3
65072,Cute design but horrible sizing.,65072,3
65072,And I don't have a big butt so I'm pretty surprised the bottoms didn't even kind of fit,65072,3
65073,The material is somewhat like a sweater so it is kinda itchy.,65073,3
65073,The fit was a little snug so I would size up if you want it to look like model in pic.,65073,3
65074,"The gloves are pretty thin and don't provide much warmth, but they work as advertised.",65074,3
65075,"cheap material and really see through, will never order anything from china again, but company gave me full refund",65075,3
65076,It is way smaller than i expected it to be.,65076,3
65077,"Comfortable, the latex smell is strong",65077,3
65078,Pretty but won't stay on,65078,3
65079,"Cute dress, runs big.",65079,3
65079,"I typically wear a med but from other reviews I took a chance on a small and I'm glad I did, a med would have been way too big.",65079,3
65079,The dress is stretchy but the band around the arm is very small and doesn't stretch.,65079,3
65079,I had to cut the sleeves so it wasn't so tight.,65079,3
65080,Fit good just didn't stay down all the time,65080,3
65082,The only reason I am giving them 3 stars is because they started to make my boyfriends ears hurt really bad.,65082,3
65082,I'm not sure if it was the material or what.,65082,3
65082,"But other than that, I thought they were great quality and I received them much sooner than expected!",65082,3
65083,I wear a 38 D cup and the XXL was still to small.,65083,3
65083,Otherwise it is a comfortable well made sports bra.,65083,3
65084,I ordered cheap and I received cheaply made jewelry.,65084,3
65085,The only 2 things I really don't like about this is that the latex is on the outside?,65085,3
65085,If it's a waist trainer what good does it do on the outside?,65085,3
65085,And the second is the TAG!,65085,3
65085,"Other than that it's comfortable and doesn't bend in sharp edges, it more like flows with your body.",65085,3
65087,Got one size up still small,65087,3
65088,Nice design...a little tight around the top,65088,3
65089,You get what you expect from a cheap pair of sunglasses,65089,3
65090,Not thrilled with design.,65090,3
65091,"The chain is way too short, and the clasp doesn't work well.",65091,3
65091,Get a different chain.,65091,3
65092,The bag I received is cute BUT the color shown on amazon for the color 'jeans' looks a lot brighter online than the actual product.,65092,3
65092,My bag is not a bright clear blue but more of a drab blue which is a bit of a disappointment.,65092,3
65093,The small was a little big on my 10 year old.,65093,3
65094,I will wear it around the house but too big I bought the small) to wear in public.,65094,3
65095,"It's a very nice coat but too bad it's a bit too big for my 5'2"" frame.",65095,3
65095,The material is thick so it'll good nice with leggings and boots in the winter!,65095,3
65096,"The shirt is very nice, but runs really small.",65096,3
65096,"The company was willing to accept a return, but it was going to cost me almost what I paid for the shirt to return it!",65096,3
65096,That is the reason for the  three stars.,65096,3
65097,Also does not fit slouchy on my head.,65097,3
65097,"Maybe because I'm trying to wear it for warmth, not style?",65097,3
65098,Nice jacket just much smaller than expected.,65098,3
65098,The bottom of the jacket has an elastic band that is very tight,65098,3
65099,"A little big around the breast area and under arms, otherwise I love it.",65099,3
65100,"Havaianas seems to be using softer rubber for the soles of its flip flops, there is a significant difference between the 2 pairs I bought in 2014 and the 5 pairs I bought this year.",65100,3
65100,"(Yes I keep hoping it's a fluke) It really makes a difference, the firmer sole provides more support and more comfort.",65100,3
65101,Expect a cheaply made costume that is itchy and fits pretty small.,65101,3
65102,A little shorter than I expected and more snug than I'd like.,65102,3
65102,I should've ordered a large even though I normally wear a Medium/size 7-8.,65102,3
65103,"This looked huge in the photos, and I never saw 3mm in the description until after it shipped.",65103,3
65103,"I am wondering if there were different size options, or if it was bait and switch.",65103,3
65103,"This is tiny, it would be ok for a pendant chain.",65103,3
65104,Its not strong enough forkids to play.,65104,3
65105,I had to take the jeans to a tailor  to be fitted correctly.,65105,3
65106,"Would have given this dress a higher rating, but the fabric seam at the base of the zipper ripped and created a hole.",65106,3
65106,I was too embarrassed because it happened while at church.,65106,3
65106,Luckily I camouflaged it a little until church ended.,65106,3
65106,The colour is pretty and the fabric was decent for the price.,65106,3
65107,Does not look like what I thought t would look like.,65107,3
65107,No wonder price was so reasonable.,65107,3
65107,THat is not Tibetan Silver.,65107,3
65107,I have Tibetan silver.,65107,3
65107,There is no comparison.,65107,3
65107,"I only gave it 3 stars, because of the style.",65107,3
65108,just ok I used it for a couple weeks and put it the garage sale,65108,3
65110,Nice dress  just not for my shape,65110,3
65111,"Nice Coat, it was just way to large.",65111,3
65112,Prettier online then in person,65112,3
65113,"super adorable, but the clasps along the legs are plastic and cheap.. would not stay closed",65113,3
65114,Nothing wrong with it but it looks and feels like what it cost.,65114,3
65114,"Very hard vinyl, cheap feel to it.",65114,3
65115,and could barely get it over my shoulders.,65115,3
65115,"Based on the size of the 2x, the guy in the picture must be wearing a 2x.",65115,3
65115,"Looking back at the size chart, it looks like the 2xl is actually a US Large.",65115,3
65115,"Really liked the shirt, too bad it doesn't come in my size.",65115,3
65115,"And, the shipping takes forever.",65115,3
65118,its very pretty but a little small,65118,3
65119,Pretty good for costume jewelry.,65119,3
65120,The idea of this set is super hot however the material is exactly like that of a thin cotton t shirt.,65120,3
65120,I'm not sure any type of undies can be worn with this without showing.,65120,3
65120,When I got it out of the bag I thought for sure I shouldn't have listen to the reviews saying it ran big b/c the skirt looked small.,65120,3
65120,"I'm 5'7"", 135lbs, 34b with hips and a booty and the small fit really well.",65120,3
65120,It was a bit tight when I first put it on but loosened after walking around in it.,65120,3
65120,I'm nervous the material will continue to stretch out when I'm wearing it and it will lose its shape.,65120,3
65120,"I think it will shrink a lot if you put it in the dryer, I would suggest hang dry.",65120,3
65120,I'm just not sure how long it will hold up b/c the material isn't great however since it's so cheap if I can get a couple wears out of it before it falls apart I'm ok with it.,65120,3
65120,"The top fits me perfect but I'm also small chested, not sure how anyone over a C cup would get much more coverage than how an actual sports bra would fit.",65120,3
65120,"Also as you can see from my picture the blue is NOT bright electric blue like the product picture, it's more like a royal blue which is so much prettier.",65120,3
65120,"The skirt is see through between your legs if you are in the bright light, shouldn't be a problem out in a club.",65120,3
65120,"Summary, it's worth the inexpensive price for one or two nights out.",65120,3
65121,Not fit to size.,65121,3
65122,I love 90 degrees products BUT!,65122,3
65122,"When they're dark they look great, with light colors unfortunately you can see everything.",65122,3
65122,"Every little imperfection you're trying to hide - it's there in your face, not to mention the shape and color of your underwear.",65122,3
65122,"So unless I order 1 or 2 sizes up, to avoid stretch, light colors are not for me.",65122,3
65122,"I'm 5'4"" and wear size 12.",65122,3
65122,Dark ones fit and look awesome though.,65122,3
65123,"My regular size is medium, with those that to small.",65123,3
65124,"Cute bathing suit but they run extremely small, I typically wear a size 6 or small, and I ordered an extra large.it fits fine except the straps are a little big but that's an easy fix.",65124,3
65124,The cups are cheap but for nine dollars this was a pretty good deal.,65124,3
65125,But for the price what can you expect.,65125,3
65126,These fit over sunglasses look great.,65126,3
65126,"However, I like to use eyeglass retainer/straps and the retainers that I use on all my other glasses will not work on these.",65126,3
65126,"They slide right off because the earpiece is-just straight, no curves to hold the straps in place.",65126,3
65126,"Other than that, they are very nice looking glasses.",65126,3
65127,There isn't much stretch to the top of this sock.,65127,3
65127,If you have larger calves then the knee highs just become bobbie socks,65127,3
65128,Its nice n all...but it needs extra care when handling when not in use.... plastic chipped off on the side and one of the arms came off....other then that its is what its worth.,65128,3
65129,The material and bow looked a little flimsy but overall the dress was very cute on my 2 year old flower girl.,65129,3
65129,It hit her at her ankle.,65129,3
65130,Not completely as pictured.,65130,3
65130,"It doesn't look like the first picture but it does look like the second and third pictures where it's just the item without it on someone, that's what the front looks like.",65130,3
65130,"I thought the top back straps would be thicker like in the first picture but they are NOT, they are very thin less than an inch wide.",65130,3
65130,"I suppose the back might look like the last picture if you pulled it down way far but if you did that the front would be way too high, and still the upper straps are just not that thick.",65130,3
65130,The crotch length is a little long and the around size is a little snug on me but it works.,65130,3
65130,"I am 5 '5"" 140 pounds I ordered the large and it fit well enough pretty bad muffin top though but it works for what I ordered it for, I just got it to lay out in and get my rear tan without being totally naked.",65130,3
65130,"BUT if I had gotten it to actually wear in public I would've been very disappointed because I do not like how it looks, I wanted something with the thicker top straps, I don't think this looks cute.",65130,3
65131,"I am 5'6"" and 130lbs.",65131,3
65131,I ordered a Large in the pink.,65131,3
65131,It fit me about right.,65131,3
65131,"I wish it was a little longer on me, but not to bad for the price.",65131,3
65133,"This case is amazing when you first get it, but is easily damaged.",65133,3
65133,"It refuses to close after being dropped once, and I can't seem to fix it so that it closes again.",65133,3
65134,Nice quality but tight around toes.,65134,3
65135,It would be better if the sizing was more accurate.,65135,3
65136,"Beautiful color, beautiful fabric.",65136,3
65136,I'm too tall or it's too short or something.,65136,3
65137,Cute and comfy but the bottoms were a little short.,65137,3
65137,I wear them anyway!,65137,3
65138,The watch is good but its a too light in my wrist.,65138,3
65138,If you don't have a big wrist don't order this watch its really big.,65138,3
65138,Trust me don't do it if you don't have big wrist but its a decent watch .,65138,3
65139,It fit me everywhere but it was very short.,65139,3
65139,I wore it as a shirt,65139,3
65141,its ok. looks and feels like plastic up close lol but looks nice from a far,65141,3
65142,The dress came back and was VERY short!,65142,3
65142,I read the reviews and thought I'd be fine because they were mixed on being too long and too short.,65142,3
65142,"I'm about 5'4 - 5'5, 125 lbs.",65142,3
65142,"Let's just say, I couldn't lift up my arms, at all, without everybody getting a show.",65142,3
65142,"It fit great everywhere else, the flowiness was what I was hoping for.",65142,3
65142,"The material is definitely very cheap, but I knew that going in with the cost.",65142,3
65142,"It did however have a little hole in it, and smelled musty but that's easily fixed.",65142,3
65142,"I think the medium would be too big for me (because of how flowy it is), but I'd say order a size up if you are on the fence because of the length.",65142,3
65142,"You can easily dress it up and not notice the cheapness, it looks pretty cute so I just wish it was an inch or two longer!",65142,3
65143,"Love it, but the clasp and pendant Lost.",65143,3
65143,I have a nice rope around my neck.,65143,3
65143,Wore for 2 hours and the pewter clasp stretched  and lost pendant.,65143,3
65146,"This product works but,one off mine is broken",65146,3
65147,I really liked this item a lot espically for its price.,65147,3
65147,But there was just one negative on it.,65147,3
65147,Apperantly when u tighten it the ball sometimes breaks in half.,65147,3
65147,othere then that I loved the colors and designs very eye appealing.,65147,3
65148,"I wear no larger then medium normally so I order large for I like my PJs not to tight, it was to tight for me other then that l liked them",65148,3
65149,"thinner than i thought they would be, but that's ok. also thought they were made of cotton, which again is ok. for the price i'm ok with it, lol.",65149,3
65149,"these shipped a lot faster too, which is a plus",65149,3
65150,These run big in the belly.,65150,3
65153,Not a great fit.,65153,3
65154,"Gave you three star because I was surprised at the material, thought it would be cotton, and the colors are not as bright as the picture.",65154,3
65155,I wish material was thicker.,65155,3
65155,The fit was true to size.,65155,3
65155,Dress looks very mature for my taste.,65155,3
65156,"Cute but, the large was a little tight.",65156,3
65156,So next time I'd go up a size.,65156,3
65157,"Great as a wallet, but it is very cheaply made and is getting worn put very quickly.",65157,3
65158,It just wasn't what I expected.,65158,3
65159,"The robe is fine, but the nightly was too small.",65159,3
65159,Order a size larger than you think if you don't want to feel too bound up.,65159,3
65160,Go up a size on this.,65160,3
65160,I ordered a 38 and it's tight.,65160,3
65160,The straps are short and don't adjust much either.,65160,3
65161,This belt is pretty but I MUST STRESS that this is not one size fits all!,65161,3
65161,Most belts I buy like this are very stretchy..,65161,3
65161,This one is not very forgiving.,65161,3
65161,"I am not small or large, I am 5'5"" 140lbs and the belt ""squeezed my fat"" in an uncomfortable manner.",65161,3
65161,It may stretch over time.,65161,3
65161,I gave 3 stars because it's pretty and I might like it better once I lost my baby weight.,65161,3
65162,Beautiful love the color,65162,3
65163,"I was expecting these capris to be the same material as the pants that I own and love from Cotton Cantina, however, they're more like leggings than pants.",65163,3
65163,"Looking at the title now, I see that that was my mistake!",65163,3
65164,I'll wear it in the summer  once or twice,65164,3
65165,Color is much darker then expected.,65165,3
65165,"Was hoping the color was brighter, But came 10 days sooner the expected date.",65165,3
65166,This top is beautiful but somewhat small.,65166,3
65166,Be careful when ordering your size.,65166,3
65167,fits well except in the arms where it is too tight.,65167,3
65168,Came with an aweful smell and it still hasn't come out after multiple washes.,65168,3
65168,It's cute but I cannot take the smell.,65168,3
65169,I am wearing this top but I don't love it.,65169,3
65169,I don't know that I would change it but the fabric is a little like a man's insulated undershirt.,65169,3
65169,"Its comfortable
but VERY informal.",65169,3
65169,"Every time I have put it on intending to wear it too work, I've ended up taking it back off and
wearing something more structured .",65169,3
65169,I wear it on football afternoons.,65169,3
65170,I ordered an XL but I definitely didn't need to order so big.,65170,3
65170,I normally wear a small and I think a medium would fit fine.,65170,3
65170,If you want loose fitting maybe just go 2 sizes up.,65170,3
65170,It doesn't look like the picture exactly of course but still great for your money I think.,65170,3
65171,They fit nice and look nice...,65171,3
65171,But it is not what I ordered.,65171,3
65171,Attached is the picture of what I received.,65171,3
65171,Thank god my son still liked them.,65171,3
65172,I think I bought it one size to small but it fits sexy got back pretty interesting .,65172,3
65172,What ever ur size may be buying one size up may be a goodnidea,65172,3
65173,These shoes run a little small and are not very flexible.,65173,3
65174,I typically wear a medium and purchased a medium which was a good fit though I expected them to be a lot longer like the picture.,65174,3
65174,I am 5' 8 and they end just under my knees instead of mid calf.,65174,3
65174,The are sort of see through when bending over but aren't too bad.,65174,3
65174,"I wasn't too impressed with the fabric, they feel cheap and I would not order these again.",65174,3
65175,"It's not nearly as long and drapey on me as it is on the model, but I'm also 5'9 so finding longer tops can be an adventure.",65175,3
65175,It'll be cute with jeans and boots or moccasins this fall and the quality is pretty good for the price.,65175,3
65176,"rather than small, I think that it runs to short...",65176,3
65177,"I have choosing a dress for the ball , that one was one of the contenders .i got a size 2 which is my normal size - it felt a bit big on me.",65177,3
65177,"I was not impressed with anything : the quality of the material was not the best , the sewing was sloppy , and the color is not as pictured .",65177,3
65177,It's somewhat not  very dark violet with steel notes .,65177,3
65177,"The only thing I like is the design of the dress itself , nothing else fit in though.",65177,3
65178,It's okay but ties are different then what's shown,65178,3
65179,I unpackaged this and tried it on when it arrived.,65179,3
65179,The black dye transferred all over my skin (hands and elsewhere).,65179,3
65179,Not sure how the color will hold with repeated pool use and I probably could have selected a more flattering swim short.,65179,3
65180,Very fast shipping... Only complaint is they are not all the silver bars half are plastic bars.,65180,3
65180,So not very good description!,65180,3
65181,Small and short in the seat and could be a little longer too!,65181,3
65182,The sizing is difficult to figure out.,65182,3
65182,Based on other reviews I did purchase an extra large and probably could go up a size.,65182,3
65182,Normally I wear a 6-8 in standard sizes.,65182,3
65182,I do like the color.,65182,3
65182,"Wearing this shell under a blazer, sweater, or jacket would be the best way to use it.",65182,3
65183,I like this but I wish the chain wasn't so dainty.,65183,3
65183,I'm scared it's gonna break.,65183,3
65184,"the hat was very good, except for the plastic buckle that controls the size, which broke off after a few days.",65184,3
65184,For this price I expected something more resilient.,65184,3
65185,Some of the studs had jagged ends and hurt going into my piercing.,65185,3
65186,I cant decide between 3 and 4.,65186,3
65186,Its a nice hoodie with quality materials.,65186,3
65186,Its smaller than a normal large and is thinner than i expected.,65186,3
65187,"It's pretty cute and mostly appears as it does in the picture, except the sleeves aren't exactly the same.",65187,3
65187,"If you want a jacket that will keep you warm and dry, the material is very thin and won't do the job.",65187,3
65187,It would only really be useful in maybe slightly windy weather.,65187,3
65187,"There are three sets of draw strings: one at the bottom, one around the waist, and one for the hood.",65187,3
65187,The ends of them aren't sewn or sealed in any way and seem to be on the verge of fraying already; I suggest stapling or coating the ends in a clear glue to keep them from fraying.,65187,3
65187,(I already stapled the one in the picture.),65187,3
65187,"The jacket is overall cheaply made, and I wouldn't recommend it for anything but fashion.",65187,3
65187,The skull pattern on the back is very pretty.,65187,3
65187,"I'll be keeping it because it's cute, but for those considering buying this, just keep these things in mind.",65187,3
65187,"Not sure if it's worth almost $20, but I can imagine wearing this with a lot of different outfits.",65187,3
65188,Doesn't fit unless you have super skinny arms.,65188,3
65188,"Other than that, it is beautiful",65188,3
65190,Color was not what it looked like it.,65190,3
65190,"More of a bright yellow, not mustard yellow.",65190,3
65191,Too small for me but material was good .,65191,3
65191,Next time I'll get a large ..,65191,3
65191,Wish they fit tho,65191,3
65192,"Nice tights, just want I wanted, warm, but I'm not even 5'3"" and these are too short.",65192,3
65192,"I can't even get them pulled up high enough, no matter how hard I tried to stretch them.",65192,3
65192,Gave them to my 10-year-old.,65192,3
65193,It's cute but the pockets were smaller / tighter than I expected.,65193,3
65194,Nice but a bit small.....,65194,3
65195,I knew to order an extra large and so it fits fine for a medium sized girl like me.,65195,3
65195,I ordered a yellow and its a neon green/yellow.,65195,3
65195,Ill keep it if I ever go to some 80's party.,65195,3
65197,Clearly printed apposed to dyed or sewn together.,65197,3
65197,Also smaller than expected.,65197,3
65197,"Material is decent silky fabric, but I'm disappointed about the stripes being printed on.",65197,3
65198,horns are hallow and made of a soft foam,65198,3
65199,"I was super excited about purchasing this sweater; however, it took so long for delivery the novelty of its arrival wore off.",65199,3
65200,It was good except I didn't know they offered buy 2 get 1 free,65200,3
65202,They are nice but I big wish the lenses was a little bit smaller,65202,3
65203,"Loved the fabric and the colors were vibrant, but just too small for me .",65203,3
65203,I am sorry I had to return it.,65203,3
65205,I have purchased quite a number of pyjama sets for my son.,65205,3
65205,This was though quite cute and attractive was not true to size.,65205,3
65205,I purchased size 7 for my 5cyear old son.,65205,3
65205,The top fits well but the pants fits like a 5T on him.,65205,3
65205,Unfortunately I can't advise to purchase a bigger size because the top fits well.,65205,3
65205,If you must buy prepare to match the top with another pyjama pants.,65205,3
65206,"Not a very flattering jacket, but it will keep the rain off!",65206,3
65208,Is more like a tank top.,65208,3
65209,A bit tight fitting.,65209,3
65210,It's an adorable dress but took the advice of it runs small.,65210,3
65210,"False, I am 5' 10 and 145lbs and I am swimming in the large.",65210,3
65210,Order your normal size.,65210,3
65211,"There's no stitching at the top so they kind of just roll down, but they're still very comfortable.",65211,3
65212,Ordered 11/30/2016 arrived 12/10/2016 pretty fast shipping also road conditions is a variable in Co. the package is very exquisite very well pleased.,65212,3
65212,However very Chinese oriented a couple of cards impossible to read do  to being in Oriental language.,65212,3
65212,I took and removed those and gave it my personal touch in an American English type of way.,65212,3
65212,"The box looks to be and smells like an walnut very strong very well built pretty heavy, very pleased.",65212,3
65212,Comes with extra wrapping paper almost as the company expects you to unwrap it.,65212,3
65212,(Though you have to unwrap it to finde out.),65212,3
65212,The jewelry is very well made but uh oh.....,65212,3
65212,I missed something the size of the necklace.,65212,3
65212,"Looks a little small, an 18 inch chain.",65212,3
65212,A little disappointed about the oversight and the lack of size chart for the chain.,65212,3
65212,So it looks like my friends I'm going to the good ol Walmart for the appropriate size chain that I need.,65212,3
65212,But the craftsmanship very well worth the price.,65212,3
65212,Just wish that there was an size chart for the jewelry.,65212,3
65212,Pity though I liked the clasp and the style of the chain not the standard American roll clasp.,65212,3
65212,I'll add an photo update a little later.,65212,3
65213,Ordered this for my Mexico summer trip.,65213,3
65213,It is very sexy but is for sure made of very cheap material.,65213,3
65213,Didn't love how the skirt fit and the top was very thin.,65213,3
65213,Overall for the trip it was fine but would not be able to wear this in everyday life or in place were people know me.,65213,3
65214,gave them as a  gift........person hasn't commented on them yet.,65214,3
65215,"Pretty but sizing is way off, I am size 4 and ordered medium, not a good fit on the bottom.",65215,3
65215,"I could get into it, but the tight fit would annoy me.",65215,3
65216,"I like this shirt, it just looks weird from the front.",65216,3
65216,"If I have seen photos for the shirt from the front I would not buy it, as I liked it because of the details on the back.",65216,3
65216,"It can be worn backwards, but it would look as a normal open top.",65216,3
65216,"I kinda like it, just not as beautiful as I expected (only because of the way it looks from the front).",65216,3
65216,It looks beautiful from the back though.,65216,3
65217,It was a really cute shirt but far too small.,65217,3
65218,The sleeves are a little snug and the roll neck is a little weird.,65218,3
65218,"Didn't know whether to roll it out, fold back, or what.",65218,3
65219,a copy of free people extratropical maxi,65219,3
65220,It fits really tight but I expected it too for what it is.,65220,3
65220,It did bunch up some and very uncomfortable,65220,3
65222,"Pretty good quality for price but hair tie doesn't stay on, just slips right off",65222,3
65223,it fits fine but but i had to cut the strap on the bottom in the back and i got a large so yeah,65223,3
65224,Kinda smaller than it seems in the pic but nice nevertheless.,65224,3
65225,Not as nice as the picture by a long shot.,65225,3
65225,Not bad for the $ though.,65225,3
65225,"A good suit is $100+, so I got about what I excepted when this one arrived.",65225,3
65226,Didn't fit that well,65226,3
65227,"Pretty decent for price, and I needed a grey belt (this is sold as ""black"" but is a nice solver / grey with black background).",65227,3
65228,"Looks just like picture, but very cheaply made!",65228,3
65229,Larger than I expected,65229,3
65230,material is kinda of cheap.,65230,3
65231,This dress is see through...you will definitely have to wear a slip with it...but I find it works great as a swimsuit cover up.,65231,3
65232,"I knew it was a skinny tie, but I didn't realize it was so skinny.",65232,3
65232,Other than that I like the color and everything but don't think I'll be using it that much.,65232,3
65233,Really cute but bigger than expected.,65233,3
65233,Hopefully she'll be able to fit in them in a couple of  months,65233,3
65234,I wear a small in almost everything.,65234,3
65234,In bikinis I wear a medium bottom and 34d top.,65234,3
65234,So I went by the reviews and got a size up.,65234,3
65234,The medium fits well in the bottom.,65234,3
65234,But the top strap that goes around the ribs is way too big and falls off of me.,65234,3
65236,Ordered my size but is way too small.,65236,3
65237,"A little big, didn't know they were linen",65237,3
65238,As a female the plastic nosepad area was big and distracting in my vision.,65238,3
65239,"i owe one of the alpine wallet and many many Swiss back pack and I am always very happy with their products
i am equally happy with my current wallet but i am looking for the same products but with a divider to hold difference currency
when i travel, this wallet fit my description but it is just way way too big for me, it barely fit my jean pocket.",65239,3
65239,Alpine Swiss put out great products,65239,3
65240,"love the fabric - and ""would"" seem to fit fine - however ordered extra large - but NO elastic at waist.......can't quite get it ON.....",65240,3
65241,not very good quality - the leather strap that's used as a zipper pull broke really quickly.,65241,3
65241,Be ready to replace the pull.,65241,3
65241,Card slots are slightly too small for some standard cards.,65241,3
65243,"Although I loved the style of the Romika Mokassso shoe, they were a full 1/2 inch shorter than my other size 39 shoes (Dansko), which made them too small.",65243,3
65243,Going up to a 40 would have made them too wide.,65243,3
65243,"Unfortunately, I had to return them for this reason.",65243,3
65243,"The return process couldn't have been easier, so I give a thumbs up for great customer service!",65243,3
65244,It's kinda snug all over.,65244,3
65244,I wish there's sizes we can choose from.,65244,3
65245,"Although I like the look of this swimsuit, it does run a tad small and the material isn't the most comfortable either.",65245,3
65245,"Overall, for the price it is not a bad buy I would just order a size up.",65245,3
65246,The Vader mask is magnificent.,65246,3
65246,Lost count of how many high fives and smiles I got while out and about.,65246,3
65246,The mask is what earned the stars.,65246,3
65246,"The ""needs improvement""
While the cut of the jumpsuit is actually tailored to more of a female shape (big plus)

Main Problem: the material is really transparent (e.g.",65246,3
65246,You could see the shape and color of my panties across my entire hip/ butt area.,65246,3
65246,BIG problem if you plan on wearing anywhere but a late night party.,65246,3
65246,"I worked around it by creative draping of the cape and wearing a pair of spandex underneath, but the double layers did get pretty hot after awhile..",65246,3
65246,"Unfortunately the zipper was also busted on mine upon taking it out of the package, which almost ended my Darth's Night of Darkness plans...",65246,3
65246,But by sheer force of will my boyfriend managed to force the zipper back together in time for Halloween.,65246,3
65246,(His inner Star Wars geek was NOT passing this costume by),65246,3
65247,"Very nuce, buts runs large.",65247,3
65248,This shirt has a brighter color than the picture...the shoulder width is 16 1/2 inches and the material stretches to about 4-5 inches more .,65248,3
65248,I am a size 4 and it fits me fine...,65248,3
65249,"Fingers plenty long which was a concern because my son has small hands, but long fingers.",65249,3
65249,"Decided however, that they were a little too large and would have been too bulky for skiing.",65249,3
65249,"A smaller size may have fit, but didn't have time to re-order.",65249,3
65250,"Looks Very Cute, But Like Other Reviews Said Sleeves Are Very Scratchy And Uncomfortable, But You Can Line the Sleeves Easily To Fix That Problem :)",65250,3
65251,This jacket looks cute in the photo but is not well made.,65251,3
65252,Fabric is thin but soft.,65252,3
65252,"I am 6' at 176, curvy.",65252,3
65252,"I bought an XL, found too clingy for my curves and because the fabric is so thin, shows too much.",65252,3
65252,"If I pull the skirt up, less clingy but falls at my shin.",65252,3
65252,At 6' this is not a maxi on me.,65252,3
65252,I bought two and will return the on I did not wear.,65252,3
65252,"The other I wore, is ok to keep.",65252,3
65253,I actually like this top.,65253,3
65253,"I'm 5ft, 120lbs, 36-38B, size 9 juniors, misses can be different depends on brand, but The Loft size 6, I think.",65253,3
65253,"If you order per size chart they list in description, it fits as expected.",65253,3
65253,I'm an Asian size XL.,65253,3
65253,I ordered this in XL.,65253,3
65253,"It's a bit loose, but I'd rather have it loose than too small.",65253,3
65253,I think I could have gotten a large and it would have fit fine.,65253,3
65253,Goes well with white shorts or pants.,65253,3
65253,"I haven't washed it yet, so can't update on that yet.",65253,3
65253,"But so far, I like it.",65253,3
65253,The waist tie kind of fits oddly/hits the waist at a weird spot..,65253,3
65253,"Lol  for the price, it's a good deal.",65253,3
65253,"Item does match the photo, which is more than I can say compared to other items ordered from China.",65253,3
65253,UPDATE 12/11/2016 - I have washed it and it get very wrinkly.,65253,3
65253,It didn't shrink as much as I thought it would.,65253,3
65253,"I'm too lazy to iron, so I just wear it as it.",65253,3
65253,It's a lot cuter with a cardigan over it.,65253,3
65253,Not so much on its own.,65253,3
65254,A little frayed and stiff but I like the hat,65254,3
65255,not at all as pictured fit-wise and very small.,65255,3
65256,Really like color & graphics.,65256,3
65257,about 6-7 of the gold studs was either off are misissing and bend up in package,65257,3
65258,This dress looks so great in the photo unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to wear it.,65258,3
65258,It doesn't come with instructions on 5 different ways to wear it or at all.,65258,3
65258,I've had it since March and I've tried multiple times to figure it out.,65258,3
65258,It's an epic fail...,65258,3
65259,"The shirt and design are great, but the size is at least one size smaller.",65259,3
65259,Ordered an XL Moto Guzzi and Victory shirt (same manufacturer/seller) and they're both small.,65259,3
65259,"I normally wear an XL, and these fit more like a tight L.",65259,3
65260,"I thought I had a normal sized head, but this fits more like a snug beanie, definitely doesn't slouch!",65260,3
65260,"The quality is nice, but I like my hats to fit a little looser than this.",65260,3
65261,"Fits loosely, no underwire, padding in front moves around and is not secured into the bra.",65261,3
65261,Would be better if the padding was attached to the bra.,65261,3
65261,Looks cute from the back but does not provide the support I was looking for.,65261,3
65262,I ordered these shoes for my son who plays basketball and he would be able to wear them for a while.,65262,3
65262,I ordered the size hr wears but for some reason these shoes were like a half size to big..,65262,3
65263,Not as classy as it looks in the pics.,65263,3
65263,Didnt like it so much.,65263,3
65264,"I loved the design and the fit, but I had to return it because it was so see through.",65264,3
65264,I just didn't have anything to put under it.,65264,3
65265,Socks feel great but shed really bad!!!!,65265,3
65265,Black and pink fuzz everywhere even after washing!,65265,3
65266,Love the shirt but I read the reviews before I bought and that was a huge mistake!,65266,3
65266,"I'm usually a Small or medium in tops, so I took the review advice and bought larger.",65266,3
65266,I recieved the XL and it was huge.,65266,3
65266,Exchanged for Large and it was also big but I kept it because I didn't want to pay for anymore shipping.,65266,3
65266,These tank tops are true to size and I will know now to order pinkstar in my regular size,65266,3
65267,The bathing suite is cute...but....I had to order an extra large in order to fit it!,65267,3
65267,"I am 5ft and 118 pounds, never have I ever had to wear something in an extra large unless I am at the children's section in a department store.",65267,3
65267,It also doesn't stretch so good luck if you have to squeeze into it.,65267,3
65268,Great deal but pin broke,65268,3
65269,Slightly too large to get into the boot and give it a good stretch.,65269,3
65270,These were cute but they were too long for me.,65270,3
65270,I'm 5'2 and have a short torso and I couldn't get them to fit quite right.,65270,3
65270,I think if i could have removed the metal piece holding together the criss cross I could have got it to work.,65270,3
65270,It is adjustable but not removable.,65270,3
65270,"Also, the clips don't grab on well.",65270,3
65270,I was trying to wear it with a skirt that was a sort of slippery material so the clips would just slip off if they were pulled a little.,65270,3
65271,It looks better in the picture,65271,3
65272,Bunches up a lot and not comfortable because of it.,65272,3
65273,Pretty.......picture was different than product.,65273,3
65273,Was surprised at length.,65273,3
65274,Small on the chest areas.,65274,3
65274,Xl is made for size B,65274,3
65275,These shoes look good.,65275,3
65275,My son says they are comfortable.,65275,3
65275,He said his feet were not hot after wearing these shoes all day.,65275,3
65275,"Unfortunately, the shoe doesn't have a good arch support.",65275,3
65275,The insole is flat.,65275,3
65275,"Pediatrician recommended shoes with good arch support, and I had high hopes for these shoes from Merrell.",65275,3
65275,"Sadly, it sems, I would have to spend another $20 for supportive insoles.",65275,3
65275,"Considering how fast kids wear out/outgrow shoes,  the price of shoes plus the price of insoles approching $60 seems excessive.",65275,3
65276,What does AR-15 Gage and it's pretty cool that you can screw it in where it will actually stay.,65276,3
65276,But the jewel is super small and pretty much a 14 gauge so you can pretty much suck it through it won't stay in your lip,65276,3
65277,The elastic waistband is SUPER tight!,65277,3
65277,"It's a one size fits all, do there's no way to get a bigger size.",65277,3
65277,I wear US size 6.,65277,3
65279,Ok products for the price.,65279,3
65279,The elastic doesn't hold got caught on something and now it's ripping after.,65279,3
65279,The metal wire is sticking out.,65279,3
65279,Hard to fit petite body portions.,65279,3
65280,It didn't fit the actual size.,65280,3
65282,It runs smaller than expected of a size medium but it's beautiful.,65282,3
65283,The collar didn't fit like the rest of the jacket.,65283,3
65283,It was very loose.,65283,3
65283,The sleeves and chest fit pretty well though.,65283,3
65283,It has a great look and feel to it but im just very picky.,65283,3
65283,All in all not bad for the price,65283,3
65284,"I don't like this bra, but it would probably work for someone who is breastfeeding.",65284,3
65284,I am pregnant and just wanted to try it out.,65284,3
65284,Too flimsy for me.,65284,3
65285,These do exactly what they claim with one major pitfall - they don't seem to be very resilient.,65285,3
65285,"So firstly, they pull things in like no other compression legging I've had - waist, thighs, bottom - with little discomfort.",65285,3
65285,I won't lie and say they feel as comfy as a toga but they don't torture you like most compression wear.,65285,3
65285,"Also, the material is nice, thick and almost pant-like.",65285,3
65285,"Not that cheap, stretchy stuff that peels after one wearing; these don't peel at all and that's a huge plus for legging.",65285,3
65285,"Nothing's like trying to look stylish in those ubiquitous thin, peeling, cheap leggings.",65285,3
65285,"The only problem, which is kind of a biggy, is they get these holes in them rather mysterious and quickly.",65285,3
65285,After only 1 or 2 wearings of each color (I got grey and black) they both started to develop holes in different places.,65285,3
65285,"The black pair just mysteriously got a pinky sized hole near the inner thigh after two wearings, no wash in between and the gray pair started getting a thinning spot (sort of like a stocking run) after three wearings and one wash.",65285,3
65285,"Regardless, I may still buy more (at least while I'm stuck in my legging body) cause they're cheap and do compress well.",65285,3
65286,This shirt runs very small.,65286,3
65286,The front is nice and flowing but the back is extremely fitted.,65286,3
65287,The skirt is cute.,65287,3
65287,But I will say that is really thin.,65287,3
65287,I wanted to use for fall but I got chilly :( but I still like it!,65287,3
65288,"It's ok, not very well made.",65288,3
65288,"But, it will work for a weekend trip.",65288,3
65289,The front os too high and the back side is too low .. it says one size but i don't think it is... if a were large it would not fit me..,65289,3
65290,Bought for my son since it states it's for a girl or a boy and it's actually very feminine so will have to give as a gift to someone else,65290,3
65291,Lace doesn't lay down on the side of the legs.,65291,3
65291,Looks just like the photo.,65291,3
65292,Would recommend ordering one size up if fuller through hips/thighs.,65292,3
65293,The material is a bit thinner than it looks and the sides do not stay propped up like in the picture.,65293,3
65293,Will only work for smaller bra's (not D) or ones without underwire.,65293,3
65294,Not in good quality,65294,3
65295,this picture is deceiving.,65295,3
65295,"Too young for me, so I gave it to my 25 year old daughter but she thinks the just above the knee length is too long for her.",65295,3
65295,guess I'm stuck with this one,65295,3
65297,It was a little small so I have it to my sister but it looks really good on her.,65297,3
65298,"the material is very thin and cheap, you can literally see through it.",65298,3
65298,I'm disappointed cause it doesn't look professionally made.,65298,3
65298,"the bottom is really high, or maybe my torso is really short, it came all the way under my bust area.",65298,3
65298,Not too happy with the purchase.,65298,3
65298,I expected it to look just like the picture and it didn't.,65298,3
65299,Great for 15-20 bucks.,65299,3
65299,Lasted a summer out on the beach but as the sun dried it out it fell to the elements.,65299,3
65299,Would buy it again on sale.,65299,3
65299,Also I left it in my car a few times so I expected it to degrade quickly.,65299,3
65300,"Cute but the material is that cheap ,flimsy jersey material.",65300,3
65300,"I just got it today,but am returning it.",65300,3
65300,It's  too sheer and see through.,65300,3
65300,It shows any cellulite that  you may have and bc of the material anu shapeware will be seen.,65300,3
65300,It's also snug in the bustas stated on previous reviews.,65300,3
65300,"The dress is very stretchy which was a plus,but fails on the material.",65300,3
65300,On the 3rd pic you can see my hand through it just to show you how clingy it is and how it shows everything.,65300,3
65301,My 3 yr-old daughter is skinny and long so this didn't fit her well :(,65301,3
65302,Not as big as I expected,65302,3
65303,It would order this shirt two sizes bigger than what you normally wear besides that it is good quality its just I don't think they have the sizes right,65303,3
65304,its ok. look a little bit cheap,65304,3
65305,"Very cheap, but very small and not the best material.",65305,3
65305,"However, I would buy it again because of the cost and I like how it looks",65305,3
65306,Very thin material and the fit was a little tight.,65306,3
65306,Pretty coloring and design that matched product picture and description.,65306,3
65307,It never stated that it never came with the feather.,65307,3
65308,"product fist perfectly, quality wise it's ok.",65308,3
65309,"I use it as a shirt, I love it!",65309,3
65310,"These are heavy, post are not very strong to support the roses.",65310,3
65310,Pretty but be careful the posts will bend.,65310,3
65312,This coat fits extremely small and not made from American sizing.,65312,3
65312,It cost a fortune to return such as about $40.00 plus dollars.,65312,3
65312,All wasn't Iost though I gave the coat to my daughter and she loves the coat she says it's soft and warm.,65312,3
65313,The buckle is a cheap version of an old military standby.,65313,3
65313,It does not work as well.,65313,3
65314,returned lens too large,65314,3
65315,The fit is wierd,65315,3
65316,I ordered 2 sizes up and the dress was still too small.,65316,3
65316,The quality of the fabric was okay for the price but not great...the biggest problem was that the dress arrived with the zipper broken.,65316,3
65316,It was halfway up the dress and stuck in the fabric.,65316,3
65316,"I gently fixed it but it would not stay zipped, it kept separating near the bottom...I returned this item...",65316,3
65317,Do not expect too much.,65317,3
65318,It's an awesome shirt that is $100 anywhere else.,65318,3
65318,So all of that I like.,65318,3
65318,"I guess this is my fault partially, but I wanted to wear this so I washed it.",65318,3
65318,It was in ironing it that I noticed threads.,65318,3
65318,"Which, okay, cut them, fine, but when you can see that underneath those threads is the beginnings of unraveling...you weep.",65318,3
65318,Probably an easy fix that I don't trust myself to tackle so hopefully I can find someone to do it for me.,65318,3
65318,"Even more so, hopefully I can find purple gray thread.",65318,3
65318,That's another thing - it might look gray but it's definitely more purple than gray.,65318,3
65319,"I'm 5'4"", with bust 38, waist 26, and butt 41.",65319,3
65319,Unfortunately the top and the length are too big!,65319,3
65319,I'm not a stunning amazon.,65319,3
65319,I'm too short for this:(,65319,3
65320,"Cheap looking and tbh, you should spend more on sunglasses.",65320,3
65320,The coating on the glass is very important.,65320,3
65321,Too small for winter shawls.,65321,3
65321,Return process is awesome.,65321,3
65322,Looks like rose gold instead of yellow!,65322,3
65323,I could see how cheap it was made but I really liked it for a couple bucks.,65323,3
65324,"The dress is ok,would not order it again though",65324,3
65325,"Its ok, the top fit smaller than expected, bottoms were a little bigger.",65325,3
65325,For less than $10 I'll keep it to swim in our home pool but wouldn't wear it out anywhere.,65325,3
65325,"Quality wise it seemed fine, padded cups ( I like padded and underwire) bottoms adjustable since they tie on the sides",65325,3
65326,The product is way to small everytime i move lose it or it drops somewhere and and is to small to find it.,65326,3
65327,I LIKED THE WAY IT LOOK AND THE THE WAY THE WATCH FIT ON IT.,65327,3
65327,IT WOULD NOT KEEP THE WATCH RUNNING AT NIGHT.,65327,3
65327,IT WAS RETURNED AND TRACKING SHOWS IT IS IN INDIANA BUT HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED BACK TO YOU YET,65327,3
65328,tried 2 different sizes  gave away,65328,3
65329,This jumpsuit is really an eye catcher.,65329,3
65329,I got compliments all night.,65329,3
65329,It is quite pretty in person.,65329,3
65329,My biggest problem was going to the restroom in it.,65329,3
65329,It is a MUST to have a good friend to go with you every time you use the restroom so they can help put you back together again.,65329,3
65329,It is extremely short.,65329,3
65329,"My butt cheek crease did show and my camel toe struggle was very real lol (wasn't very noticable though) however I am 5'10"" and have a longer torso than normal I suppose.",65329,3
65329,I wore it in Vegas but wouldn't wear it anywhere else lol.,65329,3
65329,The next morning I noticed scratches on my thighs and a few on my back.,65329,3
65329,It was from my moving and dancing around so much the sequins tore me up lol.,65329,3
65329,I duct taped my boobs as you cannot wear a bra with this.,65329,3
65329,"This outfit is really just for looks, I don't think it's very functional lol.",65329,3
65330,Pants for very thin and run a little small,65330,3
65331,These feel good until about the 6th mile.,65331,3
65331,I like the other Saxx boxers that I have.,65331,3
65331,The waist band irritated my skin on this one,65331,3
65332,Loved the quality but the M fits like a SM.,65332,3
65333,iTS IS ALSO SEE THROUGH AND i DIDN'T KNOW THAT  AND KINDA BIG FOR A MEDIUM,65333,3
65334,"skinny ties, my husband won't wear them...",65334,3
65335,"Gorgeous dress if it would have fitted, not even close to my usual size",65335,3
65336,the size is smaller than expected.,65336,3
65336,The material and feeling of it is great.,65336,3
65337,"Runs a little small, didn't need the hole puncher but it didn't come with it.",65337,3
65337,"As it says in reviews, I bought the silver and black had no hermes engravement ships way faster than they say.",65337,3
65337,No one will be able to tell unless u make it a real center of attention in broad daylight,65337,3
65338,I wear size S and these are too big.,65338,3
65338,But OK quality and was shipped quickly.,65338,3
65339,They don't tell you the bottoms are french cut in the back!,65339,3
65340,This shirt is a nice color.,65340,3
65340,It's is a little thin but not so much so that you need an undershirt.,65340,3
65340,"It isn't as long in the back as I would like, and is actually longer in front.",65340,3
65340,It's a fun design and I get compliments when I wear it.,65340,3
65340,I ordered Med and should have gotten a Sm.,65340,3
65340,"I'm 5'5"" and 130lb.",65340,3
65340,"Over all, it's a nice shirt for the price!",65340,3
65341,Loses it's stick really easily.,65341,3
65343,The dress is gorgeous but the zipper is extremely difficult and will not last long.,65343,3
65344,The bottoms were small to for a size large,65344,3
65345,the brown material is stupid... its not even below the elbows.. its on the side of the arm.,65345,3
65345,and barely covers the back,65345,3
65346,It was smaller than I thought it would be.,65346,3
65346,"Ordered the size that my son normally wears, and I wish I would've ordered bigger.",65346,3
65347,They are not calf length unless your much younger kid.,65347,3
65347,So disappointed I wanted them for boot socks but gave them to my daughter which is not calf socks either for her.,65347,3
65348,Somewhat large had to return,65348,3
65349,It's a nice or age color bottom fits well top is okay but I wish it had lining so when I wrap around the abdominal it stays and not crunch up.,65349,3
65349,I got a belly lol.,65349,3
65349,I actually like how they wrap around the boobies though.,65349,3
65350,The straps along the back where snapped into place.,65350,3
65350,The shoulder strap that these snapped into was too long so this caused the front top to hang way too low causing some issues.,65350,3
65351,The belts are quite thick not in width but the actual thickness of the belt.,65351,3
65351,I'm not real fond of that feature.,65351,3
65352,The quality is average.,65352,3
65352,Just don't expect too much.,65352,3
65353,would be cute if it fit,65353,3
65354,I love the shirt but my side panels were crooked.,65354,3
65354,I still wear it but I notice it and it drives me crazy.,65354,3
65356,"I was hoping for a more fitted look, so this dress might look better on bigger women.",65356,3
65356,"The ""leather"" insets are kind of strange.",65356,3
65356,But this dress will work well for a family holiday gathering or whatever.,65356,3
65358,"They were really cheap, but they did the job.",65358,3
65358,I bought them for a Halloween costume and it worked out fine.,65358,3
65358,The shoe ran really big though...,65358,3
65358,They were literally sliding off my foot overtime I walked.,65358,3
65358,Make sure to order at least half a size smaller.,65358,3
65358,"I'm a size 9, and I should've ordered an 8/8.5!",65358,3
65359,These are nice earrings; substantial and shiny with some sparkle.,65359,3
65359,I was sorry to return them but the wires were much larger than my earring holes would accept.,65359,3
65359,These are a great option if you can handle the larger wires.,65359,3
65361,quality is nowhere near what I expected - its also heavy - Could be picked up locally at the mall or flea market,65361,3
65362,"The umbrella is cool, but it looks more purple than blue.",65362,3
65363,I guess they are okay but the fit for me was terrible.,65363,3
65363,I tried them on and noticed how badly they fit (way too large) and threw them away and ordered a second set of Adidas socks in the same color.,65363,3
65363,I wear a size 11 and tough finding this color in ankle socks.,65363,3
65364,"Lettering on the back is blurry, as though the shirt and/or screen moved during printing.",65364,3
65364,"Looks like a ""second"" that might be had at a carnival.",65364,3
65366,not a thick shirt shows skin color,65366,3
65367,The top was larger than i expected and the bottoms were wayyyyy too small,65367,3
65368,"I'm 5'5, 115lbs, and a 32DD bust.",65368,3
65368,I ordered a size 4 and am very happy with the fit.,65368,3
65368,"My cleavage is nowhere near as drastic as the picture shown because I wear this dress to work in a professional office environment, but it can definitely be a chesty dress if you wear it that way.it hits about 3"" above my knee and is very thin, soft, and stretchy - exactly what I want in Texas weather.",65368,3
65368,However the fabric fits oddly loose around the stomach.,65368,3
65368,Almost like a maternity dress would.,65368,3
65368,"It's not a problem and the dress looks great on, I just wasn't expecting it.",65368,3
65371,"Asian sizing, ordered the largest plus size and it fit my size 6 Grandaughter, nice garment though",65371,3
65372,This dress was way too small  to be an extra large.,65372,3
65372,"Even though it is a nice casual dress and the material is somewhat stretchy, it still did not fit.",65372,3
65372,"I'm not going to return it, though because it is still a cute dress.",65372,3
65372,I'm just going to give it to my 14 year old daughter and I'm sure she will love it.,65372,3
65373,Works alright for driving over prescription glasses.,65373,3
65373,A little bulky for active use.,65373,3
65375,"Great color, just a bit narrow if you have the broader man.",65375,3
65376,The fabric feels comfortable but the shirt didn't fit me.,65376,3
65376,The bat wing design is difficult to wear since you won't be able to move your arm freely without the shirt becomes un-tugged.,65376,3
65377,"But definitely not a push up... Quality, breathable fabric and lined bottoms will deffinetly lead me to buy another color or pattern fir the great price.",65377,3
65378,runs a bit large.,65378,3
65378,Too late to return it I needed it for vacation,65378,3
65379,"Unfortunately, this robe did not fit me well.",65379,3
65379,"The customer service, however, was nice enough to refund my money.",65379,3
65379,I was very pleased at how they worked with me for the refund and were very eager to make sure I was a satisfied customer.,65379,3
65381,"this is a good stuff, work perfectly with my solar g shock.",65381,3
65381,"but, when i try using bose soundlink 3 charger for this item its fine.",65381,3
65381,work perfectly around 30 minutes.,65381,3
65381,i bought this item almost 1 month.,65381,3
65381,after that the lamp almost all going down.,65381,3
65381,only 2 LED's on.,65381,3
65381,"so i warn everybody, better using mobile phone charger with usb cable.",65381,3
65381,"i don't know this because bose soundlink 3 charger, or maybe i got the bad item.",65381,3
65383,Too big for my 100 lbs 5' frame.,65383,3
65383,Bigger than same company's Electric blue design.,65383,3
65383,I don't like the feel of the nylon-y material.,65383,3
65383,Will return even though tey are very pretty.,65383,3
65383,If I were taller.....,65383,3
65383,I would put up with the feel for the look!,65383,3
65384,Its pretty much a small hoop with a layer of tulle on top of it.,65384,3
65388,Colors are much lighter in person and they are pretty see through.,65388,3
65388,I would have given more stars if I hadn't gotten duplicate colors and no clear pair at all.,65388,3
65390,"My husband loves this hoodie, but if it ever gets dried accidently, it won't fit him anymore.",65390,3
65391,"As with many women's clothing on Amazon, it is a nice design idea, but flimsy material and sized poorly.",65391,3
65391,22w is like a 16.,65391,3
65392,Sizing runs very small so I ordered larger.,65392,3
65392,Large too small and XL too large.,65392,3
65393,only because I thought it was a bright yellow and it is not.,65393,3
65393,Like the black bow at the waist.,65393,3
65393,Great value for the price.,65393,3
65394,Not like the picture.,65394,3
65394,its the same length all the way around.,65394,3
65394,I don't like how formfitting it is!,65394,3
65395,cute pj's but the tops are really short,65395,3
65396,first off it arrived really fast.,65396,3
65396,The top is too big I normally wear 34B or a small top.,65396,3
65396,The skirt fit perfect its just not long enough to give it the same look at the picture.,65396,3
65396,So I ordered a different skirt same color.,65396,3
65396,I tried using double sided tape so that the top can at least stay up but did not work.,65396,3
65396,If I move my are arms anyway the entire top will flip down.,65396,3
65397,Nice but skulls are very small,65397,3
65398,Was perfect in the arms.,65398,3
65398,But it cut into my groin and I had to continue to pull it down.,65398,3
65398,And the side seams and leg holes were slightly off which really bothered me.,65398,3
65398,The left side was a bit lower than the right.,65398,3
65398,Could just be me and my body tho.. A very pretty bathing suit to say the least as long as your very petite.,65398,3
65399,"cute, to small for what my granddaughter thought they would be.",65399,3
65400,Same size as others I've purchased but this one was too small.,65400,3
65401,Is exactly what itbsays it is and good quality,65401,3
65402,It's cute but runs very small,65402,3
65403,"Returning these the button came off,",65403,3
65404,"I like it, but it is not completely comfortable across my forehead.",65404,3
65404,I walk half marathons so I'm wearing it for several hours at a time.,65404,3
65405,Bent ear rest arm thing one side didn't rest on my ear laying them flat on the counter you could tell they were bent out funny.,65405,3
65405,"Other wise looks great I was able to bend them back to the right position hope they last, but are cheap biker glasses..",65405,3
65406,The bottoms are tighter than expected.,65406,3
65406,But besides that I love the swim suit.,65406,3
65407,"My only complaint about these, and unfortunately it's an important one, is that the zippers are not very sturdy.",65407,3
65407,"On my first trip using these cubes, 2 zippers broke on two of the cubes.",65407,3
65407,I did not fill them overly full and they just pulled off the tracks.,65407,3
65408,"I got one bad sample (right calf lines are way too curved toward inside), other is OK",65408,3
65409,Fits a little bit different than his last pair,65409,3
65410,I just received my pullover and I was pleased it looks exactly like the picture and was nicely made.,65410,3
65410,I would recommend other products from this co.,65410,3
65411,"Got a size too large, I got a medium with a 30 in.",65411,3
65411,waist and it was too big on me.,65411,3
65412,Beautiful print - however the material is very...meh.,65412,3
65412,And a bit loud when walking.,65412,3
65413,Material very thin and not what I expected,65413,3
65414,I agree with the other reviewers in that this jacket runs a little small.,65414,3
65415,Did not expect this to be as skimpy as it is.,65415,3
65415,"Great material, but definitely an all out thong sui.",65415,3
65416,This item is not red by any means.,65416,3
65416,The color that arrives was more a peach/pink with some cranberry thrown in.,65416,3
65416,"Ordinarily i might not mind, but I purchased for a Cmas party so not exactly ideal.",65416,3
65417,I bought this as a gift for a pregnant friend.,65417,3
65417,"After receiving it, I knew it would be too tight and make her feel self-conscious.",65417,3
65417,I decided to try it on because I really liked the dress.,65417,3
65417,It was a great fit and I'm not pregnant.,65417,3
65417,I am 5'6 and 130lbs.,65417,3
65417,The dress is almost too long for me but maybe if I had a baby bump that would shorten it up.,65417,3
65418,Did not arrive in time stated and was not true to size,65418,3
65419,Purchased this bracelet for a friend with cancer.,65419,3
65419,She loves the bracelet but the clasp broke.,65419,3
65420,Not made in America  Made in China.,65420,3
65420,Should say that first.,65420,3
65420,"If I know this, l would of bought a 3x.",65420,3
65421,Material doesn't stretch so make sure when you order you get the appropriate size.,65421,3
65421,"I am 5""2 121lbs got the Medium one.",65421,3
65422,XL size is closer to size large.,65422,3
65422,Would look good on a small body.,65422,3
65423,My only complaint is that after having it for like a month the zipper broke,65423,3
65424,"Cute style, but extremely cheaply made and cheap quality.",65424,3
65424,One button on back has already fallen off before I tried it on.,65424,3
65424,"(Also, buttons are black with the blue dress, not blue like the photo) It's also VERY sheer; you definitely need to wear a slip under this dress.",65424,3
65424,"I'm 5'8"", 145lbs, dress size M(6) and I ordered a LARGE in this dress.",65424,3
65425,"Comfy for round the house , but will not keep you warm if looking for to wear outside in cold weather.",65425,3
65427,The bows were a lot smaller than in the stock photo.,65427,3
65427,My daughter is 18 months and they fit her head well as well as my 5 year old,65427,3
65428,"Not as long as I would have liked, and I'm not very tall (5'4)",65428,3
65429,"Nice gown, well made, good value... but pictured as being longer than it actually is.",65429,3
65429,Not floor length by any means if that is what you are looking for.,65429,3
65430,"I followed the sizing chart for this dress, as well as read the reviews when purchasing this dress.",65430,3
65430,It a little smaller than I expected.,65430,3
65430,The lace straps could have been a better quality.,65430,3
65430,Its an OK dress.,65430,3
65431,Stone fell out shortly after receiving,65431,3
65432,Good price for this handbag,65432,3

65436,Not as black as I hoped they would be !,65436,3
65437,"I was worried about buying this dress but decided to get it anyways, and I'm so happy I did!",65437,3
65437,I ordered up a size and it fits me perfectly.,65437,3
65437,My only complaint was that the zipper was not very good and broke the third time I tried it on.,65437,3
65437,It snagged on nothing and popped off.,65437,3
65437,An easy fix though.,65437,3
65439,Loved the size and fit of the dress it would be great if it was also available in cotton during this hot clammy weather!,65439,3
65440,somewhat larger than I expected.,65440,3
65440,"The fabric is okay, slightly itchy which I wasn't expecting.",65440,3
65440,"Ill keep them though, I'm expecting in November and the fold over top is great with my growing belly.",65440,3
65441,The dress fit well.,65441,3
65441,"It's pretty short, but I had already planned to wear it with leggings anyway.",65441,3
65441,The material feels nice.,65441,3
65441,"I'll be returning it, though, because I bought the purple and it's very dark.",65441,3
65441,I'll definitely be buying it in a different color.,65441,3
65442,"My wife used it for one time, during a 3 hours flight, is arrived at destination with sipper broken.",65442,3
65442,we will fix the zipper and will be able to use it again.,65442,3
65443,"Very cute, but runs small.",65443,3
65443,I wear 4-6 and bought these medium.,65443,3
65443,They give some unfortunate muffin top.,65443,3
65443,Buy a size up.,65443,3
65444,They seem to run small,65444,3
65445,Can wear it as a dress!,65445,3
65446,It's very nice but runs large.,65446,3
65447,"It's cute, although the black print on the purple shirt is way too dark and difficult to see.",65447,3
65447,I'd return it except I don't want to pay the return shipping fee.,65447,3
65448,quality is okwide size is okbut a litlte short,65448,3
65449,The small size isn't anything close to small.,65449,3
65450,Fit somewhat small in the shoulder area.,65450,3
65450,Wish I would have gone up a size on it.,65450,3
65451,Material is very thin but will serve well as a bathing suit cover up.,65451,3
65452,Had a strong chemical spell but it washed out.,65452,3
65452,I ordered up a seize and it was still small side,65452,3
65453,Size is way off I ordered my size and it doesn't fit not very happy now all the hassle of sending back but very pretty,65453,3
65454,I get a lot of complements of the jacket.,65454,3
65454,Material looks nice and not cheap.,65454,3
65454,Only issue is the part that covers your shoulders keeps slipping back.,65454,3
65455,"I normally wear a medium, so I had ordered a large just to make sure it would fit.",65455,3
65455,"Unfortunately, the large was too small and had to reorder an extra large and then had to return the large.",65455,3
65455,Just wish the size chart was a TRUE TO FIT size chart.,65455,3
65455,Just make sure if you order that you order two sizes larger than what you normally wear.,65455,3
65456,This would fit a 0-6 month old it's too small for any bigger than that.,65456,3
65457,Came way too small.,65457,3
65457,Lol but after adjusting them and losing all strength out of my hands I was able to fit them on.,65457,3
65457,They look pretty good so far and they stay on.,65457,3
65458,Very thing and small belt.,65458,3
65459,The onesie is fine.,65459,3
65459,"Its a little dirty, but its the right size and I plan on washing it first anyway.",65459,3
65459,The skirt isn't very well made.,65459,3
65459,It has very little tulle and isn't nearly as full as the picture shows.,65459,3
65460,I wear a XL and got a 3xl based on reviews and its still snug,65460,3
65461,Sizing chart is off.,65461,3
65461,"Bought it for my mom and it was two sizes too big, pretty though.",65461,3
65462,Would have liked them better if they were closer to the same size.,65462,3
65462,They also come out in my sleep.,65462,3
65463,Smaller than I had hoped and the gold was faded.,65463,3
65463,Not as vivid as picture.,65463,3
65464,Nice bracelet but it's not a real lokai,65464,3
65467,so cute but runs way small..,65467,3
65468,"Pretty, but these had like a fog inside the glass, and paint on the outside, so I won't be giving them to anyone but my granddaughters to play with.",65468,3
65468,Still they are pretty.,65468,3
65469,It's heavy on the wrist and mine broke the second time I wore it.,65469,3
65469,"I wouldn't buy it again, but I liked the way it looked.",65469,3
65470,I typically wear a small and this was pretty big,65470,3
65471,"Need to check where the product is made, Asian sizing runs a lot smaller than American sizing",65471,3
65472,I could get them on.,65472,3
65472,They were perfect for my costume.,65472,3
65472,I'm a size 8 and ordered the large.,65472,3
65472,I still could have used some wiggle room.,65472,3
65472,These things are not built for anyone with a butt.,65472,3
65472,They also don't breath.,65472,3
65472,I thought I might use them later for circus arts classes but the shimmer on them is costume quality.,65472,3
65472,One and done kinda thing.,65472,3
65473,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a cousin that loves purses, but of course I inspected it on arrival.",65473,3
65473,"I was hoping for better, and I really hope it doesn't fall apart or break on her.",65473,3
65473,It's a little dingy.,65473,3
65473,"The straps are flimsy, the zippers are cheap.",65473,3
65473,"The pockets are nice, though, and the canvas seems to be pretty good.",65473,3
65473,It's a good sized bag.,65473,3
65473,"It is more green than in the picture, was hoping for that brownish green as in the pic.",65473,3
65473,"As long as it doesn't break on her for a while then I guess it will have been worth it, if she likes it.",65473,3
65474,Wide and not as long/slouchy as would have liked.,65474,3
65475,Love this over size sweather have not cleaned it yet.,65475,3
65475,Not the best but for the price and to throw on a good deal,65475,3
65476,"Nice quality, a bit tight around the shoulders and ordered a medium.",65476,3
65476,Fits well every where else.,65476,3
65476,Maybe order a size up?,65476,3
65477,it's okay as it doesn't fit as well as I wish.,65477,3
65477,I followed measurements but don't work,65477,3
65478,They are a bit tight in the  thigh and crotch area,65478,3
65479,"It nice, love the leather smell, but doesn't look like its going to last long.",65479,3
65480,Bought these for our visits to Disney.,65480,3
65480,"The material is thinner than I expected, and it looks like you're wearing a garbage bag.",65480,3
65480,I'm not expecting more than a one-time use out of these.,65480,3
65480,I believe they will tear easily.,65480,3
65480,The print is not as vibrant on the front to really distinguish it as a 'jedi' design.,65480,3
65480,"That said, my boys really liked them.",65480,3
65480,Shipping was very fast.,65480,3
65481,"I like the material it's soft but does not look like the picture , it's ok",65481,3
65483,Color is more of a grey tinted pink than shown.,65483,3
65483,Nice comfortable fit however very large and sags.,65483,3
65483,"Rolling this bad boy also does not look pleasing, if this were in a smaller size i would have loved it, unfortunately theres only a one size fits all kind.",65483,3
65484,The picture looks better than the actual product.,65484,3
65484,The lenses are mirrored but you can see through them.,65484,3
65484,"They are light in wight, but it is because they are pretty cheaply made.",65484,3
65484,The lenses tend to pop loose from time to time.,65484,3
65484,"The coating on them starts to get smudges that you can clean off after a while, too.",65484,3
65484,They are what they are though; A decent pair of cheap sunglasses.,65484,3
65485,"I am not sure how I feel about them yet but considering the price, I will give them a chance.",65485,3
65485,The shape of the glasses are almost too flat but we will see.,65485,3
65486,I had read several reviews about the dress before I placed my order.,65486,3
65486,So I knew that it ran small.,65486,3
65486,So I purposely went up a size.,65486,3
65486,But it still fits snugly.,65486,3
65488,I bought this swimsuit in a size small.,65488,3
65488,"Not only did I love the style but I thought it would look perfect since many of my physical characteristics are similar, if not match, the model wearing it (minus a cup size or so Lol!).",65488,3
65488,"The butt of the swimsuit is great, but the top is a bit big for me.",65488,3
65488,Its nice for moms that want to cover up some stretch marks.,65488,3
65488,"I like it, but I thought I'd love it.",65488,3
65488,It's one of those items that look better on the hanger or on the model than they do actually on you.,65488,3
65488,Shipping was prompt though.,65488,3
65489,Might get just a few uses out of these.,65489,3
65489,I would suggest going to a store to buy in person before ordering online..,65489,3
65490,Yellow lines do not show.,65490,3
65490,Do not look like the glasses shown at all.,65490,3
65491,"The dress is beautiful, however; WAY too large.",65491,3
65491,I gave them my measurements and it was just HUGE on me.,65491,3
65491,"The hips on it were the worst of it, but the dress didn't even stay up which is why you see my physically holding it.",65491,3
65491,I didn't bother trying to fuss with the straps since I could clearly see it was Much too large.,65491,3
65491,"I told them that I was going to have to have it tailored, and they offered me $50 refund.",65491,3
65491,"I guess that's okay, but I imagine the alterations are going to cost me about $400.",65491,3
65491,The dress was very well made though and the seller was very quick to respond.,65491,3
65491,I would say it's pretty true to the picture...just not sure about what happened with sizing.,65491,3
65492,Add 2 sizes larger than your usual.,65492,3
65493,Waistband elastic is too thick that it bunches up  around waist.,65493,3
65493,Overall shorts are nice,65493,3
65494,This just fits weird.,65494,3
65494,The padding that came in it is definitely not one size fits all.,65494,3
65494,"As someone who has an A cup they were extremely too large and I ended up having to take them out, but the front is just weirdly made in general.",65494,3
65494,Still nice considering the price though,65494,3
65495,Too small does not have what's needed...,65495,3
65496,The quality is good and nice finish.,65496,3
65496,"The problem is the size, it is not 38 it is much smaller that 38",65496,3
65497,It's a very nice dress but it runs too small.,65497,3
65498,Size runs small and didn't like that the blouse is split on both sides.,65498,3
65499,"It's actually really cute, but definitely a little small.",65499,3
65500,it is bigger than the picture,65500,3
65501,It was way too large for the kid.,65501,3
65502,i have returned this item,65502,3
65503,Smaller then I thought !,65503,3
65503,My fault should have paid attention to demensions.,65503,3
65504,"Fair warning, I know these are listed as ""plus"" sized bangles, but they're huge!",65504,3
65505,So I got my band yesterday.,65505,3
65505,"I am on sure yet, but I think I might like it.",65505,3
65505,I got to check out  The Apple link bracelet.,65505,3
65505,"From what I remember of that band, it really does feel like it.",65505,3
65505,"Being unable to see, I can't personally described what the band looks like.",65505,3
65505,"I have been told that it does look OK with my watch, but that the color doesn't quite match up.",65505,3
65505,"Also, I can't even use the band right now  because the tools that came in the packaging to adjust the band, weren't the right tools.",65505,3
65505,There were also no instructions included with the packaging.,65505,3
65505,My  rating as of right now  reflects  both of these issues.,65505,3
65505,"When I go to a jeweler and get my band adjusted  so I can actually wear it without the watch falling off of my wrist, I will update my review.",65505,3
65506,I'm typically a medium.,65506,3
65506,Based upon the  size chart I purchased a large and it's too big.,65506,3
65506,I tried to shrink it but it didn't work.,65506,3
65506,It did come with a lot of the stitching coming apart but that was inside the shirt.,65506,3
65506,"All in all I like it, just wish I ordered my normal size M.",65506,3
65507,Size is forgiving..pretty snug.,65507,3
65508,It's a very cute outfit but the bodysuit is shown as a long sleeve and the description says long sleeve.,65508,3
65508,I received a short sleeve body suit so just confused on why everything shows and says long sleeve but I received short sleeve.,65508,3
65509,"no stockings or gloves included
fits very tight around the bust with no room to spare
fabric is NOT stretchy so make sure your measurements are exact
NOT recommended for 'curvy' women",65509,3
65510,"I was so excited to receive this top, yet when I opened the bag and tried it on, not only was it slightly larger, but it also had two holes next to the seam.",65510,3
65510,So I am having to return the top:( Cute top but hard to inspect when buying online:/,65510,3
65512,Do not work according to what I hope or by description.,65512,3
65513,"Smaller than I expected, ink not inside lettering.",65513,3
65513,Get what you pay for I guess.,65513,3
65514,If these socks had not had such tight elastic at the top I would have given them 5 stars.,65514,3
65514,I gave them away.,65514,3
65514,Suitable for those with skinny legs.,65514,3
65515,Great price but not auto r mechanical requires a battery,65515,3
65516,This item broke maybe only two weeks after I wore it for the first time.,65516,3
65517,They are not at all binding.,65517,3
65517,They could be a little bit thicker though.,65517,3
65518,Not as pictured this shirt is cut to this style does not come as pictures,65518,3
65519,"IT'S WORTH THE PRICE, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.",65519,3
65520,"It looks bulky in your shoulders, like you are wearing shoulder pads.",65520,3
65520,Cute design and fabric.,65520,3
65521,I think this jewelry is exactly what it claims to be.,65521,3
65521,Unfortunately my ears did not like the metal so I threw them out.,65521,3
65521,"I also had a very hard time screwing the backs on, my BFF had to help me (I have 4 ear piercings).",65521,3
65522,I wore it once and I don't think I will purchase again,65522,3
65524,Ring was acceptable but it is advertised as coming in a gift bag etc.....,65524,3
65524,It does not ...,65524,3
65524,The packaging while protective was shotty at best.... Had to pry packing tape off the ring and was looking forward to a gift bag by it actually is a gift.,65524,3
65525,Good color and design.,65525,3
65526,The suit was great quality and very pretty.,65526,3
65526,"A little big in the sense of front to back or side to side, but not a problem.",65526,3
65526,The issue is that it's too short.,65526,3
65526,I'm 5'8 and weigh about 200lbs and the top duh into my boobs because it wouldn't pull up high enough.,65526,3
65526,Please see the picture attached.,65526,3
65526,Just assume that if you're taller than 5'4 or so that it will not come all the way up!,65526,3
65527,Read the description twice!,65527,3
65527,"This is a cute jacket just not what I had expected, it's super thin, comes folded up in a pouch smaller than an adult fist.",65527,3
65527,"Great for my kayak emergency jacket, it folds up small enough into its piuch that it won't take up hardly any room in my compartment.",65527,3
65528,Got an XL and it's still a little small.,65528,3
65529,The color is not exactly as pictured but I like it anyway.,65529,3
65531,If you go thighs or hips not the size for you,65531,3
65532,"However, it is very sheer.",65532,3
65532,I have to wear shorts and a top underneath.,65532,3
65532,Otherwise its a nice dress.,65532,3
65533,"the first pair I got was beautiful, the stones sparkled so nice but then I ordered another pair for a gift and they did not turn out so well!",65533,3
65533,"stones were like broken glass, so sad.",65533,3
65534,It feels nice and love the material but it barley fits me.,65534,3
65535,You definitely have to have the right shaped earlobes for these otherwise you may have to try to bend them a bit to get them to fit like I did.,65535,3
65536,extremely short especially for full bottoms,65536,3
65537,Costume is as pictured.,65537,3
65537,Says one size fits all but this item is very small.,65537,3
65537,It fits just right but person wearing it is size 1 juniors.,65537,3
65539,It only comes with one sock but it's,65539,3
65540,"These earrings are very pretty, but the backs never stay on them.",65540,3
65540,I've had them for almost a month and I already lost one of the back pieces.,65540,3
65540,"If the backs stayed on, I would have given them a 5.",65540,3
65540,Plus it took almost 2 months to finally receive them.,65540,3
65541,"I purchased a large, cute top but it's not long enough, I do have a fairly long torso, but it barely reaches the top of my jeans.",65541,3
65541,Other than that it fits fine.,65541,3
65541,I'm 5'5 145 pounds and a large chest.,65541,3
65541,"Order a size up, I'm normally a medium.",65541,3
65542,My nice got these and she told me they are a little see through and a bit longer than Capri's.,65542,3
65543,It's not heavy at all and cheaply made.,65543,3
65543,Good for a little kid but not a man.,65543,3
65544,"they're okay, just don't machine wash them because they are Very delicate.",65544,3
65544,hand washing is 100% recommended.,65544,3
65544,"also, remove the pads in the bra, they Will either fall out or get a tad damaged.",65544,3
65544,"I repeat, Do Not machine wash them.",65544,3
65544,I did and the rubber strings in it where popping out everywhere.,65544,3
65544,Thank goodness I only washed 2 of them.,65544,3
65544,it's a good starter bra if you have small boobs but not very durable.,65544,3
65545,Much smaller than an adult medium,65545,3
65546,Had it for a couple of months now.,65546,3
65546,The ring is cracking.,65546,3
65548,Husband loved it but only gave 3 stars because  it was not a great fit and was not as white as should be plus was more like teas hire.,65548,3
65548,I had to wear tiny skirt for full effect,65548,3
65549,It fits really small.,65549,3
65549,My 10 year old could barely wear a x-large.,65549,3
65550,Ordered a size 40 fits like a 38.,65550,3
65551,Nothing wrong with the shoes quality.,65551,3
65551,They were just to small.,65551,3
65551,"I have reordered in Girls size 4 from different supplier.-

The seller is requiring me to pay to have them shipped back.",65551,3
65552,"Not really what I wanted, but I knew that when I purchased it.",65552,3
65552,"The quality is so-so, as is the fit and finish.",65552,3
65552,"Not the best, highest-quality product I've ever purchased, but it was cheap.",65552,3
65553,"I liked the style, but it was too small",65553,3
65554,"Pretty, just a bit heavy on the wrist.",65554,3
65555,"Now that I got the right size, I can tell you that I really like this shoe!",65555,3
65555,I feel that the padding is just right for me-light enough that I can feel the ground beneath me while enjoying the benefits of some padding...good for lifting and some running.,65555,3
65555,NOT good for lateral movements so be careful!,65555,3
65555,Bottom will remain planted but not enough reinforcement to stop your foot from moving within the shoe = catastrophe for high speed work.,65555,3
65556,This dress Runs way too small the material is very thin and non stretch.,65556,3
65557,Too short to fit comfortably for me.,65557,3
65558,It's really cute but the top is kinda loose but bottoms fit perfect but I do have very small boobs wish the top was more tighter,65558,3
65559,Fabric snagged the first time I wore it and the neck facing shredded.,65559,3
65559,"However, I do like the comfort, pockets and overall fit.",65559,3
65560,I got this for my husband's birthday.,65560,3
65560,I suggested a terry robe to him because he had one years ago (that eventually wore out and he got rid of) and he said that was a good idea but the robe had to be really thick.,65560,3
65560,After reading the reviews on this one--many which said it was thick--I ordered this for him.,65560,3
65560,"Well, it's not thin, but it's certainly not thick.",65560,3
65560,"He's worn it, but probably just to be polite or out of convenience.",65560,3
65560,Whether he'll continue wearing it remains to be seen....,65560,3
65561,i wear a 15 5e shoe I needed help getting the shoes wide enough.,65561,3
65561,I think with some home made shims it might work.,65561,3
65563,she like them as her water shoes,65563,3
65564,It's a bit large for the Surface.,65564,3
65564,I like the design and quality of it.,65564,3
65565,The pendant is nice but the chain is ugly and makes it look cheap I'm gonna have to buy better chain,65565,3
65566,"A little on the thin side, but still nice enough; however, they feel like they won't last a long time and could easily run.",65566,3
65567,"didn't notice it was silver plated at time of purchase, too shinny.",65567,3
65568,material is not what I expected and too small.,65568,3
65568,"I take a size medium, bought large and still did not fit right.",65568,3
65568,I suspect you would need to order 2 times larger to be a comfortable fit.,65568,3
65569,Too loose and big.,65569,3
65570,"It fits perfect but the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the shirt has a tear on the side, when it should be sewen like the other side ,",65570,3
65571,"Great glasses, but short, in that you cannot place them on your head, the arms are not long enough to grab your ears and hold atop your head.",65571,3
65572,The words on the shirt go too far to the sides making it hard to read.,65572,3
65573,Very nice but already broken I used it only once.,65573,3
65574,Top run small and also bottom runs big .,65574,3
65574,Didnt fit me well,65574,3
65575,did not really look in person as it does in the photo.,65575,3
65575,Might be cute enough for a school dance but not really the quality I would wear to a formal event.,65575,3
65577,Super cute dress I like it a lot except that the zipper kept coming down in the back when I was wearing it which caused me to pay more attention to my outfit than what I was doing.,65577,3
65577,I think a simple hook at the top will be a solution  but it was still frustrating.,65577,3
65578,My husband is short so I will have to shorten them.,65578,3
65579,I didn't realize it was going to be as lightweight and cheap feeling.,65579,3
65579,But it's still a fun piece.,65579,3
65579,Probably made somewhere for 35 cents plus shipping.,65579,3
65580,This shirt runs very very large.,65580,3
65580,I ordered a 2X (the size I normally wear) and it was as big as a tent.,65580,3
65580,Very nice shirt though.,65580,3
65580,I returned it and will purchase a smaller size.,65580,3
65581,Back of shoe by heel is cut too low where your foot wants to pop out of the shoe.,65581,3
65582,Earrings are very large - too comfortable to wear.,65582,3
65582,I wish they were smaller.,65582,3
65583,The leg opening is Too small,65583,3
65584,This is the third dress I ordered from David's Bridal and will return.,65584,3
65584,I find the reviews to be inaccurate.,65584,3
65584,"I don't agree that this dress is made for all body types, at least not for me.",65584,3
65584,"I have somewhat of a curvy figure (big top, small waist, big bottom) and I wasn't impressed.",65584,3
65584,I must say it does fit true to size.,65584,3
65584,"I'm 5'3"" the dress is long and will only need to be altered if you're planning on wearing flats.",65584,3
65584,My friend chose to use Malibu in her wedding so I am limited only to David's Bridal and will now be ordering a 4th dress.,65584,3
65584,For the price I really expected David's Bridal Dresses to be more elegant and better quality.,65584,3
65584,"Wish I could find Malibu at another store, too bad it's not the exact same color as turquoise.",65584,3
65585,It's a little transparent,65585,3
65586,my grandson will not get but a couple of wears out of it,65586,3
65587,Person I bought it for won't wear it she says it's uncomfortable :(,65587,3
65589,"I can't tell them from the very high dollar ones, can you?",65589,3
65591,The speaker and button openings don't match up on  my phone.,65591,3
65591,I have a LG K4 (Spree) from Cricket Wireless.,65591,3
65591,It is easy enough to modify the phone sleeve part that holds the phone.,65591,3
65591,The card pockets are also pretty flimsy.,65591,3
65591,"I will use it while traveling but for everyday use,  they would wear out pretty quickly.",65591,3
65592,I received the item on time however it runs a bit small.,65592,3
65593,They put on the Crusaders Cross Crooked.... not bad but still its crooked.,65593,3
65594,The top is too big but the bottoms fit properly so I'm going to keep it.,65594,3
65594,The top is much fuller / blousey than the pictures.,65594,3
65594,But it's made well for the price.,65594,3
65595,The stitching is uneven on the right arm.,65595,3
65595,Fits me comfortably except for that arm.,65595,3
65595,I'm 5'6 a 38D - it covers my chest.,65595,3
65597,fix well but was disappointed with the quality of the material,65597,3
65598,Socks were not the same as the product photo.,65598,3
65598,They were all white with no dark toe or heel.,65598,3
65599,This item says that it is generally too large for some people but it was extremely too tight on my chest.,65599,3
65599,I would order 2 sizes larger than usual if you are larger in the bust area.,65599,3
65600,I would have loved it But I expected for it to be a lot longer like the picture of the model.,65600,3
65600,I bought a size medium I'm 5'1 115lbs and I wore the skirt high waisted and it dropped to my ankles.,65600,3
65602,Not in the shape that I would have liked to have it in.,65602,3
65602,I had to have it cleaned and buffed due to scratches and other material not being cleaned off it.,65602,3
65602,I was able to get the majority of the blemishes out but will be more concerned on future orders.,65602,3
65603,A little snug in the arms.,65603,3
65604,"They appears to be well made and they are not overly heavy but after a couple of days, they do start to irritate my ears.",65604,3
65604,So I need to wait a week or two between wearings.,65604,3
65605,tight around the bust and tissue is not for beach..,65605,3
65606,Would be great as a belt clip.,65606,3
65606,"Not great for a money clip keychain, for which I purchased it for.",65606,3
65607,I bought a size small as that's what I normally wear in everything but now I wish I got a size medium or even large.,65607,3
65607,My stomach hasn't grown much and I'm barely showing yet this fits a little tighter than I would like.,65607,3
65607,I'm not sure if I'll even be able to use it by next month.,65607,3
65607,I would suggest getting a large.,65607,3
65608,I generally wear a L or X depending.,65608,3
65608,I had to buy an XXXL of this shirt and even then it's a funny fit.,65608,3
65609,My daughter loves the dress.,65609,3
65609,"Her hips are a little wide, so that was really the only the problem, that's not the dress' fault.",65609,3
65609,"But, she loves it and she looks beautiful it.",65609,3
65610,Very cute but a bit tighter than expected.,65610,3
65611,A lot smaller and more cheap looking that I thought it would be.,65611,3
65612,"its really pretty, can't wait to loose enough weight to fit in it.",65612,3
65613,this fits great and feel nice but there are 3 spots that the threads are no good as u can see from the photos.,65613,3
65613,kinda makes me upset cuz im not sure how well it will hold up if i wash it which is a real shame cuz i do like the top and wanted to get more but not sure if i should :/,65613,3
65614,It was way too big.,65614,3
65615,I like it in the picture - but it doesn't look like that on me.,65615,3
65616,Like the dress but it's too smal,65616,3
65617,"Sleeves, bust and waist fit nicely, not to form fitting but still shows girly figure.",65617,3
65617,"Unfortunately, it was a little shorter in the torso then I would like.",65617,3
65617,"138 lbs, 34 B-C bust if that helps anyone.",65617,3
65618,"Runs small in the bust area, but good quality material and super cute",65618,3
65619,"This was pretty, but the heart fell off.",65619,3
65620,Cheap material and the buttons did not stayed attached.,65620,3
65620,The actually aren't sewn to the jacket or attached in any way.,65620,3
65620,I do like the coat but it's not what I expected quality wise.,65620,3
65621,Very nice I just didn't like it,65621,3
65622,The barbell part is great but the actual skull isn't stainless steel so it tarnishes.,65622,3
65623,Cheaply made base metal.,65623,3
65623,Price was too much for what it is.,65623,3
65623,"I love the fleur de lis, tho.",65623,3
65624,buy 1 size bigger to fit,65624,3
65625,"I have a larger chest - it fits, but a bit snug.",65625,3
65625,I would only wear it under a cardigan or blazer due to the snug look.,65625,3
65625,"If I order again, I'd order a size up.",65625,3
65626,I purchased my normal corset size and it was very very small!,65626,3
65626,Cute on but very small,65626,3
65627,"Too big for my embarrassingly small hands, but otherwise a quality product.",65627,3
65628,It was way too big,65628,3
65629,Took long for shipping amd sizing was small,65629,3
65631,Bought this for our grandson when he uses our blow up pool.,65631,3
65631,Wanted to make sure he didn't get splinters on the deck.,65631,3
65631,It is very good also for preventing slipping and falling when in the pool and out of the pool.,65631,3
65631,It's easy to put on and take off.,65631,3
65631,He can even do it alone and he is 2.,65631,3
65631,The only thing I do not love is how much water is holds so the water is  sloshing around in the shoes when he gets out of the pool to run around the backyard grass.,65631,3
65632,"plastic button on the inside too, not covered with fabric.",65632,3
65633,"Very cute top, but hard to wear a bra with because of the fit.",65633,3
65634,It's nice haven't used it yet.,65634,3
65634,I hope it's what I want for this fall.,65634,3
65636,"it's alright, ordered medium and it's tight on my shoulders.",65636,3
65636,end  up return it.,65636,3
65636,"It looks a bit cheap compare to the Patagonia i have, but you get what you pay for, it's not a very fair comparison i guess.",65636,3
65637,This is a good no-frills belt for the price charged.,65637,3
65637,However belt length and easy-to-lose belt loop decreased my rating.,65637,3
65637,The belt came with a hole punch in case you need to add another hole to shorten the belt.,65637,3
65637,(The hole punch makes a round hole whereas the other pre-existing holes on the belt are oval shaped.,65637,3
65637,This different hole shape will be unnoticeable since the buckle hides the hole.),65637,3
65637,"Note, the belt size does run large.",65637,3
65637,I wear a size 6/8 and ordered size Small due to the other reviews.,65637,3
65637,"At its shortest, the belt measured 33 inches and was loose on my natural waist!",65637,3
65637,This size worked ok for pants that ride on the hips but I will probably punch another hole to make the belt shorter for those pants that sit on my natural waist.,65637,3
65637,There are 2 belt loops on the belt.,65637,3
65637,One is secured and stays next to the buckle.,65637,3
65637,"The 2nd belt loop is loose and ""float"" around the belt.",65637,3
65637,It can easily come off when you hang it on a hook.,65637,3
65637,It would be much better if the loop wrapped around the belt tighter so it does not fall off.,65637,3
65637,"Lastly, this belt is only 3/4"" thick so it may be too thin for jeans.",65637,3
65637,It would work better for dress pants.,65637,3
65638,The ring is somewhat as expected.,65638,3
65638,Disappointed that the goldplating in the center not as brilliant as presented or described.,65638,3
65639,This is a nice slip but I couldn't wear it under something completely see through.,65639,3
65639,It rises up when I walk (over my butt cheeks for me) so I was constantly pulling it down.,65639,3
65639,The material just isn't good to wear as a slip but it's very comfortable.,65639,3
65639,I would only wear this under a loose dress that had itchy fabric or something similar.,65639,3
65640,"But unfortunately, I tried to make an educated guess at the size, and I ordered too small!",65640,3
65640,Too close to Christmas to exchange..,65640,3
65641,Sweater was a bit small and the neck area was odd.,65641,3
65641,Ended up not wearing this for Christmas after all.,65641,3
65642,NOT AS IN THE PICTURE.,65642,3
65643,"Love the design, love the color (well.",65643,3
65643,.black) but the size is sort of misleading.,65643,3
65643,"I was expecting a US size garment, but I think the sizes are for tiny women and not for larger American women.",65643,3
65644,There were a lot of loose threads on the jacket when it came in.,65644,3
65644,But all in all it's still a functioning jacket.,65644,3
65645,The length and the fit is great but they are thin.,65645,3
65645,I was wearing white underwear when I tried them on and I could see my panties through the fabric in direct light.,65645,3
65645,I a keeping the bottoms but putting a tennis skirt bottom over them to make a skort.,65645,3
65645,It know it is kind of ridiculous wearing two swim bottoms but it is better than risking showing the world more than I had planned.,65645,3
65646,Ok so if you wear anything over a medium you can't wear this shirt.,65646,3
65646,"I wear an XL normally and ordered a 2X ( I'm 5'9"" 225 muscular build) Unless you like your shirts to look like they are airbrushed on.",65646,3
65646,"On the positive, the material is awesome and it looks great.",65646,3
65646,Just the sizing is way off.,65646,3
65646,It's like child's sizing.,65646,3
65647,"This shirt is very nice, but it is not true to size.",65647,3
65648,it's ok. not worth more than $2.00,65648,3
65649,The material for this dress was just beautiful.,65649,3
65649,"The dress was well made, but too small.",65649,3
65649,I have to return it.,65649,3
65650,"Black one fit perfectly, this color a little smaller through waist.",65650,3
65651,Looks nice but just a little large in the arms,65651,3
65652,"Its ok but I thought it would be lil bigger
To also put cash in",65652,3
65653,I was so excited to get this item only to find out it ran too small.,65653,3
65653,I bought an XXL and I'm an XL,65653,3
65654,More of a yellow green than the picture shows.,65654,3
65654,They are pretty long and hard to get in but I just cut it and was able to get them in easier.,65654,3
65654,It's serving it's purpose for now so not too bad.,65654,3
65655,The tights arrived fairly worn.,65655,3
65655,"The ink in the section where the ears are is very patchy, and in some places it is noticeable from a far-away glance.",65655,3
65655,"They are also somewhat loose around my waist (5'2, 115lbs) and I find myself pulling them up several times throughout the day.",65655,3
65655,"Despite this, I received a lot of compliments!",65655,3
65655,I think I will continue to wear them.,65655,3
65656,"I'm 5'2"", 130 pounds, and a 36C and normally wear a medium.",65656,3
65656,"According to the measurement chart, I should be wearing an extra large in this tank.",65656,3
65656,I ended up ordering an extra large and a large (due to my pride).,65656,3
65656,"Turns out, both sizes were way too big.",65656,3
65656,I will be returning both of these tanks for a medium.,65656,3
65657,It's fits very small I'm a size 2 and I ordered a large  but I love it though looked great,65657,3
65658,I had read the reviews and it said it will be too small so I bought two sizes larger and still tight,65658,3
65659,I'm in between liking and not liking this t-shirt dress.,65659,3
65659,"It's way too short to wear this as a dress, however it looks good with leggings.",65659,3
65659,"The size fits as expected, I just wish it wasn't that in between length.",65659,3
65659,I also like that it's not see through for a mostly white shirt.,65659,3
65660,I feel as if this was for a teen rather than an adult.,65660,3
65660,The sleeves are ok but it's just TOO tight for an adult.,65660,3
65661,The white sandals are not white.,65661,3
65661,They are a light yellow or beige or muslin - not sure what to call the color.,65661,3
65661,They don't go with much.,65661,3
65661,"The shoes have a pretty design, fit well, very comfortable - so it's unfortunate.",65661,3
65662,Maybe not so good for tall and thinner women like myself.,65662,3
65662,Very cute though and good quality.,65662,3
65662,The neckline is pretty low cut,65662,3
65663,Nice material but it took too much time to arrive and it runs small,65663,3
65664,This is very cute style with a few problems.,65664,3
65664,1) the length in front does not hit anywhere close to where it lands in the picture on me.,65664,3
65664,Larger chest  sizes beware here.,65664,3
65664,"2) the pockets may land smack dab on breasts, again probably a larger chest size issue 3) the strings are not closed at the ends so frayed upon arrival.",65664,3
65664,Probably constructed for less curvy women.,65664,3
65664,"Great blue color, though and think the material would create great draping boho look on the right frame.",65664,3
65665,The sleeves seem shorter than pictures.,65665,3
65665,Nice stretchy cotton material.,65665,3
65665,Seller sent free postage label for return.,65665,3
65665,I will order in a smaller size and see if I like it.,65665,3
65666,I ordered a 2X which is pretty much the size I usually wear (1X-2X depending on material) and it fir great.,65666,3
65666,I like the style but the material is VERY thin.,65666,3
65666,I would definitely have to wear a second pair of leggings underneath since you can see my underwear through.,65666,3
65666,Even is I wore a top long enough to cover my bottom I still wouldn't feel comfortable enough to wear them without a second pair underneath.,65666,3
65667,its too thin and Balsani brand is thicker.,65667,3
65667,We will se how long it will last me,65667,3
65668,A bit too clingy of material,65668,3
65669,It is a very very very thin material.,65669,3
65669,But I guess for the cost- its what to be expected.,65669,3
65670,Too long for short  person,65670,3
65672,"It was nicely designed and well put together, but is not true to size- order a size larger!",65672,3
65673,Had to drop a few pounds to fit properly..,65673,3
65674,"not the best quality ,but good for everyday",65674,3
65675,I guess for the price it is o.k.,65675,3
65675,but I really am not that crazy about it.,65675,3
65676,These earrings are awesome but it's larger and heavier than I expected.,65676,3
65676,Other than that they look great!,65676,3
65677,"I wasn't expecting the collar to be ruffled the way it is, but my significant other loves it.",65677,3
65678,I own a pig skin jacket so I figured a hat of the same material might be cool.,65678,3
65678,I purchased this hat for the winter months.,65678,3
65678,This pig skin hat is not as soft as I hoped for.,65678,3
65678,It is also sized much larger then my other Stetsons.,65678,3
65678,If I had seen this in a store and tried it on I would not have purchased it.,65678,3
65678,Its not worth returning and will find use for it so its a keeper.,65678,3
65678,"I would order it a size smaller, soak it in warm water and stretch it to proper size with a hat stretcher as it dried.",65678,3
65680,started ciming undown at stitches first time worn,65680,3
65681,Was a bit small.,65681,3
65683,"Break very easily - the top plastic and the nose piece broke on both of the pairs I ordered
Great Polarization though easily comparable to Costas and RayBan polarization
I used mine in a marine, salty, humid environment and saw no problems with rust or corrosion",65683,3
65684,To short for me....gave to my 16 year ol...she loves them,65684,3
65686,"Looks good, but wayyyy overpriced considering these are probably ordered from China for well under a buck each.",65686,3
65687,"Although this bag is lovely, I didn't find it be worth more than $40-$50!",65687,3
65687,"I was excited when my bag arrived and immediately after opening it, I noticed a sour smell coming from the bag.",65687,3
65687,"I checked the purse thoroughly and didn't notice anything wrong, so I filled my bag.",65687,3
65687,"The next day, my make up bag and vitamin container smelled like the purse.",65687,3
65687,"This fishy-like scent was too much, that after spraying with Febreezer and letting it air dry for 2 days, the scent has started to fade.",65687,3
65687,It is very spacious and can hold a lot of stuff.,65687,3
65687,"I really liek this bag and it  would've gotten a 5 star review, but that darn smell was such a  turn off!!!",65687,3
65688,I main to bought this bathing suit for the top.,65688,3
65688,It was a bit small but manageable.,65688,3
65688,"As for the bottom I got the large and it just doesn't fit, so if you have a bigger butt might not be for you.",65688,3
65689,Is not the type of sweat shirt I expected.,65689,3
65689,Didn't expect it to be so stretchy.,65689,3
65690,This watch band looks good on my LG G Watch but because if the spacing of the holes it is always either too loose or too tight on my wrist.,65690,3
65690,The rings that hold the excess strap had some powder coat or paint missing as soon as it came out of the package as well.,65690,3
65690,Overall the quality is what you would expect for the price but I wish the holes we a few millimeters closer to the end of the band.,65690,3
65691,"The dress fits me great, not to tight not too loose.",65691,3
65691,It shows more cleavage than I would like but not too much.,65691,3
65691,"I alway get compliments on it, especially when I pair it with a petticoat.",65691,3
65691,I wear it all year long.,65691,3
65691,"In the winter I just put a sweater or long sleeved shirt over it and then people think it's a skirt, I do the same in the summer with a shirt, it give the outfit more style versatility.",65691,3
65691,The zipper is horrible.,65691,3
65691,It has broken too many times to count and just last week it popped so I am not happy.,65691,3
65692,The length is a little too short to comfortably wear.,65692,3
65694,A bit to small for me and i order according to the chart.,65694,3
65697,"I own several Mud Pie brand dresses and am almost always a size L, and this was swimming on me.",65697,3
65697,"I'm also not thrilled, however, that the size medium or small would have cost me 5 times as much (no exaggeration).",65697,3
65697,"So I stuck with the large, with will still be very cute with a belt.",65697,3
65698,The 2-4 size was to BIG for our 5 year old.,65698,3
65699,Had to take in the bust area but fits ok the material is nice,65699,3
65700,Had to order a larger size than normal but ok as long as you pay attention to the size chart.,65700,3
65700,Material kind of thin.,65700,3
65701,"5'5, ~185, 36G, usually wear a 12 in dresses (have gained some weight, so maybe a 14), ordered XL in navy.",65701,3
65701,It's a little snug and somewhat see through.,65701,3
65701,"According to the size chart, I should've ordered a L. I'm wondering if I should've ordered an XXL.",65701,3
65701,"If you have very large breasts, definitely go up a size or two if you can.",65701,3
65701,I feel like my boobs are going to stretch these straps out in no time.,65701,3
65701,They're pretty flimsy little straps.,65701,3
65702,Good quality on pendant.,65702,3
65702,I would have loved the chain to be longer.,65702,3
65702,I suggest a coat of clear porcelain spray on chain so your neck doesn't turn green.,65702,3
65704,Just wasn't what I was looking for so I returned it.,65704,3
65704,I am also 5ft 2in and it was too long for me.,65704,3
65705,I'm disappointed because It is way too small for me to wear even though it is a cool shirt.,65705,3
65705,One thing I didn't like about it was that the white part of the shirt was kind of see through so I would wear an undershirt.,65705,3
65705,I recommend getting medium if your regular shirt size is small.,65705,3
65706,Bikini is as pretty as the picture.,65706,3
65706,"The sizing measuements correspond more with junior sizes, extremely tight and snug for a more seasoned body shape.",65706,3
65706,Straps could be 2 or 3 inches longer.,65706,3
65707,"It's ok at best, nothing special",65707,3
65708,"very thin, but wearable and comfortable, runs a little small",65708,3
65709,This top was a little large.,65709,3
65709,"It's hard to wear a bra with this top, so if you are not chesty it may not stay up well.",65709,3
65710,These were much smaller than anticipated.,65710,3
65710,These bows are suitable for young girls only and are quite small.,65710,3
65710,They measure 3.5 inches from outside edge to outside edge of the loops and 4 inches from top to bottom.,65710,3
65710,"I should have read more carefully, but the word large in the description is misleading.",65710,3
65710,The colors are nice and ribbon is good quality.,65710,3
65712,"Loved the style, but it ran really small.",65712,3
65713,"Size up ladies, if your order this one",65713,3
65714,This is a small compact kit really more suited for travel than regular use.,65714,3
65714,It works but I was disappointed in the size.,65714,3
65714,Should have read the description more.,65714,3
65715,Will probably be another 3 months before she can wear the outfit,65715,3
65716,Get one size bigger,65716,3
65717,"I can wear this as a cover shirt for an under s***, but definitely not as a dress, it's way too short and it runs small so the material separates at the buttons showing too much skin.",65717,3
65717,I got this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.,65717,3
65718,Cute but you get what you pay for.,65718,3
65718,The colors bleed in the wash and they fall apart quickly.,65718,3
65719,I love the dress but horrible material,65719,3
65720,This shows burgundy and blue in the pictures.,65720,3
65720,It arrived medium brown and blue in the mail.,65720,3
65720,"It's not worth the cost of sending back, but you need a better color description.",65720,3
65720,It's not what I wanted or ordered.,65720,3
65720,Quality is ok for the cost.,65720,3
65721,I would order one size up for perfect fit.,65721,3
65721,Arrived faster than expected as well,65721,3
65722,Material is extremely thin!,65722,3
65723,"Unique artwork, but colors are not as vibrant as the picture would lead you to believe.",65723,3
65723,"First day I wore it my husband hit a bear with the car, so the bears seem to go bonkers for it.",65723,3
65724,This dress is really nice but some of the embroidery is already coming undone.,65724,3
65724,The hook and eye closures were poorly sewn so I re attached them all.,65724,3
65724,It's a little snug in the chest and the back of it comes up a bit high (right at hairline).,65724,3
65725,"It's ok,better ones out there.",65725,3
65726,"Though the quality of the belt seems very good, a floating belt loop is rediculous and will easily be lost.",65726,3
65726,"Also, be sure to check your order carefully.",65726,3
65726,"I purchased 2 belts of the same size, but receive one belt about 2"" shorter than posted on the box.",65726,3
65727,Zipper broke really soon,65727,3
65728,I love these pants - the colour is beautiful and they are super comfortable!,65728,3
65728,But... After 2 wears they show really bad wear at the seams.,65728,3
65728,Stiches are stretched out and there are 2-3 holes forming ... And the fit in them is actuall on the slightly loose side so it's not like they are being stretched to capacity....,65728,3
65728,I hope they make it thru the 3rd wear....,65728,3
65728,So.. All that to say.. Beautiful pants but the quality is bit lacking.,65728,3
65728,They seem very affordable but at 10$ per wear ...,65728,3
65728,The pricing is a lil bit steep if you ask me...,65728,3
65729,The post sometimes shows to the front.,65729,3
65732,"Cute pajamas, but the arms on the top were really tight.",65732,3
65732,The rest of the pajamas fit like normal.,65732,3
65733,Too small for C-D cup size,65733,3
65734,"I ordered similar in blue that was perfect in 3xl
Disappointed with this one!",65734,3
65734,"3xl too but small, look like 2xl cannot wear it",65734,3
65735,But it is exactly same as the picture.,65735,3
65735,and it is beautiful.,65735,3
65735,"i had to return it because I wear in small size, I ordered a medium, and steal it was small for me.",65735,3
65736,Didn't like the feel of the fabric.,65736,3
65737,"Order a size up, these are way to tight.",65737,3
65738,They don't fit on some of my more expensive pieces which is disappointing but they work great when they do fit!,65738,3
65739,Measured my niece's foot to determine size.,65739,3
65739,They are still way too big.,65739,3
65741,there is some shrinkage after washing,65741,3
65743,I love the look/style of this hat but it's a little big on my head.,65743,3
65743,I still wear it but it doesn't fit as well as my other fedora of a similar size.,65743,3
65744,The straps are placed far out to the sides in the back so it feels like they are going to slide down my shoulders.,65744,3
65744,I have never seen a bra with the straps placed like this.,65744,3
65745,They are larger than the size I ordered.,65745,3
65745,Have to stretch up a bit,65745,3
65746,Not as what expected.,65746,3
65747,"Cute, but just ok.",65747,3
65748,It's just what I was wanting.,65748,3
65749,I got this for my father and the lights don't work on the Damn sweater at all and I put the batteries in.,65749,3
65750,also no distinct way to distinguish front and back until I used a safety pin to hold the straps together or make a back.,65750,3
65750,"It was extremely ugly to wear until I did this, and it hung too low to cover any of the goods before that as well.",65750,3
65750,"now its better I just wear it with skin colored or grey bras and its alright, as long as I keep that safety pin there.",65750,3
65750,I get compliments on it occasionally.,65750,3
65751,I bought this bathing suit skirt for my honeymoon in Mexico I'm a size 10-12 bottom and this is pretty snug around my waist.. not only that it does not look anything like the picture when it comes in it is literally for rectangle pieces of fabric that are sewn into a waistband front back side and side I don't even see how if the wind blew it could look like the picture I won't be taking this on my honeymoon read the reviews before you buy,65751,3
65752,"I like it, but the gluing to the headband did not hold, so 1/2 way through the tea I was attending, the fascinator had slid down the headband and was covering my ear.",65752,3
65752,Not a pretty sight.,65752,3
65753,"Good quality , smelt funny",65753,3
65754,It has hard the 'silver' off fairly quickly.,65754,3
65754,"Mostly on the paw prints so it almost looks intentional, but it's starting to become an all over effect.",65754,3
65755,Fits much smaller than I thought.,65755,3
65755,I thought it would be a bit baggy like the picture but it is not.,65755,3
65755,It is also quite see through and the arms are hard to bend because the sequins fall right on the elbow region.,65755,3
65755,"That being said, I still like it and will wear it once in a while.",65755,3
65756,Little lengths and broad,65756,3
65757,"Tough zipper, difficult to put on in rainstorm.",65757,3
65758,It is so adorable but size is too small.,65758,3
65758,Baby is 12 months and size 12 to 18 months is too small so I'll return it and try another size,65758,3
65759,It was too much of a high cut around the groin and the back it barely covered the bikini zone and the bust was too low I ordered a medium and I'm usually between sizes 6&8,65759,3
65760,"I AM small (5'6"", 120 lbs.).",65760,3
65760,"I ordered a large, and it's still too small.",65760,3
65760,I'll give it to a friend.,65760,3
65760,"But it's very well made, and I think a very fair price, so I can't really knock it.",65760,3
65760,But the sizing is way off.,65760,3
65760,"I was going to reorder it in an XL, but it isn't available.",65760,3
65761,"Quality is nice, but size way too small from what was expected.",65761,3
65762,"The fabric is very stiff, and I found it to be somewhat uncomfortable.",65762,3
65763,"The color was very true and material soft, but the it ran small and the print was off centered..I ended up giving this to a little girl who loves pineapples!",65763,3
65764,"I got a size small, it fits like a medium or large.",65764,3
65764,if you don't like your clothes to fit baggy i would suggest to skip this item.,65764,3
65764,but i don't mind and i loved print.,65764,3
65765,"first of all I don't think you can really call it steel boned, it only has two steed bones at the front snaps.",65765,3
65765,but the fabric is sturdy and I haven't had any buckling with the plastic bones.,65765,3
65765,over all for the price it's pretty nice,65765,3
65766,Nice shirt but too small in the shoulders.,65766,3
65767,I give 5 stars for appearance and 1 star for fit.,65767,3
65767,They are great looking but extremely small and almost impossible to attach without help from a small fingered person.,65767,3
65767,Don't let the pics fool you.,65767,3
65767,They are about the size that would fit an undeveloped 12-year old kid on a cold day.,65767,3
65767,So I gave them 3 stars.,65767,3
65768,I wasn't a fan of the material.,65768,3
65768,I don't like when it stretch it has that shiny look to it.,65768,3
65769,It was very small and short so not suited for a woman of my height at 5'7.,65769,3
65769,It was pretty and the colors were nice so I kept it and gave to my 12 year old daughter.,65769,3
65770,"Fit weirdly, but cute.",65770,3
65771,Such a cute suit...... good quality.,65771,3
65771,My only complaint is that it runs extremely small.,65771,3
65771,Ordered a size up and it was still way too small :(,65771,3
65772,The package arrived as expected.,65772,3
65772,I tried on the gray pants and they fit perfectly.,65772,3
65772,"Love the thick material, and they stretch to fit my body without being too snug.",65772,3
65772,"However, the black pants were completely different, even though they came together.",65772,3
65772,"The material was not the same, sheer, and not as stretchy.",65772,3
65772,They also fit smaller.,65772,3
65772,And because of the different material they do not stretch to fit comfortably.,65772,3
65772,I am disappointed and would like to return the black only.,65772,3
65772,I just need to know if they accept just one of the items.,65772,3
65774,"Very soft material, but wrinkles very easily.",65774,3
65774,"Tank top does not cover chest, so expect to wear an undershirt.",65774,3
65774,"Also, if you 'leak' onto it, it will show on material even if it is dry.",65774,3
65774,"Overall it's ok, but expensive.",65774,3
65775,Its pretty and surprised at how well made it is.,65775,3
65775,The problem is ..for me..is the neck is not quite pick enough.,65775,3
65775,However the earring do really well.,65775,3
65776,The fleece pants are very thick,65776,3
65778,"Great shirt, but sizing was way off and had to send back because it was too big.",65778,3
65779,I barely pulled one thread while trying to fix it and literally the whole sleeve came off...very cheaply made.,65779,3
65779,"The other sleeve is starting to unravel to the point where if i were to pull the thread even a little bit, this cover up will become a one shoulder blouse.",65779,3
65779,"It's beautiful, the creators of this bathing suit cover-up had the right idea, but it's much shorter than it looks and completely flimsy.",65779,3
65780,"This dress would probably be good looking on a taller person, but on my 5'2"", somewhat rounded frame, it was not flattering at all.",65780,3
65780,The dress also ran small - it was EXTREMELY tight on me.,65780,3
65780,And the fabric was somewhat unpleasant - very thick and synthetic feeling.,65780,3
65780,"Seemed to be well made, however.",65780,3
65780,"For the right person, this could be very attractive.",65780,3
65780,But it didn't work for me.,65780,3
65782,"Extremely top, and well-made, but way smaller than expected.",65782,3
65782,"Kept it anyway, for use at home, but would never be able to wear it in public!",65782,3
65782,"Buy at least one size bigger than you need, if not two!",65782,3
65783,"The material is a bit different than I was expecting and it doesn't really come
Up on the sides like the picture makes it look.",65783,3
65783,But overall i like it and the fit and the length!,65783,3
65784,Wrinkles like crazy and the white top is incredibly thin.,65784,3
65785,Pretty but fell right off my wrists and I lost them in a week.,65785,3
65786,They are nice but I like my clothing to breath a little more.,65786,3
65786,"they are super fitting...
and the material is more for winter then summer in California..",65786,3
65787,"It is great for a child, but small for an adult.",65787,3
65788,"I went by the size chart, but the item is at least 2 sizes too large.",65788,3
65788,"Even so, the pleats start above my bust, so there's extra fabric just where I don't need it.",65788,3
65788,"However, the top is made decently and the fabric is a nice weight.",65788,3
65788,"For the price, I'm happy to have this wear around the house.",65788,3
65790,Started unthreading after first wear.,65790,3
65791,Rather large for the size,65791,3
65792,Always get a compliment !,65792,3
65793,It's good for the prize buy a size larger mine seems to run smaller.,65793,3
65795,Very cute dress but humanly impossible to bend over in this.,65795,3
65795,its right under your butt.,65795,3
65796,Need to return or exchange for the right size,65796,3
65797,Got it for my son.,65797,3
65797,Comical because it's made in CHINA.,65797,3
65798,As always with famous panda the shipping & delivery was 5 star.,65798,3
65798,The quality of the shirt (Gildan) is great the image however lacked some detail.,65798,3
65799,I ordered the jacket 1 size up.,65799,3
65799,It fit much larger in the body than expected.,65799,3
65799,Sleeves were also ex-long.,65799,3
65799,"Well made, as pictured,",65799,3
65800,"These came REALLY quick, like scary quick!",65800,3
65800,"Did not anticipate that, as I live in the US and they came all the way from China!",65800,3
65800,"Anyway, when I took them out if the packaging, they looked really small, so I was about to be upset, until I put them on - They're very stretchy, the same material as stocking tights.",65800,3
65800,"This was nice for me, because I wear tights every single day!",65800,3
65800,Only thing I don't like is how they roll.,65800,3
65800,"I'm not huge, but I'm definitely not stick thin (I wish I was, haha), so they won't really stay up when you walk.",65800,3
65800,"I'll have to invest in a garter; before purchasing, I suggest the same for others :)",65800,3
65801,Quality leaves a bit to be desired; you can see the clear outline of a square around the screen printing.,65801,3
65801,"Otherwise, it's a thin jersey sort of shirt.",65801,3
65801,"Comfy, and served its purpose.",65801,3
65801,Not quality enough to have me coming back,65801,3
65802,Nice but could be a bit longer and bigger.,65802,3
65802,"Once washed, they seem to have shrunk quite a bit but I like them.",65802,3
65803,If doesn't fit bad.,65803,3
65803,I ordered a medium and I usually wear a small/sometimes medium.,65803,3
65803,It is pretty see through and my husband wasn't happy about that.,65803,3
65803,"I can wear something under it, it will just make it hotter though.",65803,3
65804,Fit well but arrived broken.,65804,3
65804,Ordered a purple one just like it for my daughter and it kept her face and head warm and dry.,65804,3
65805,Collar had a weird fit.,65805,3
65806,I love the dress but my normal size is a 14 and the large was way too small in the chest.,65806,3
65807,Beautiful swimsuit but was way too big for a medium.,65807,3
65807,Had to reorder it and get it in a smaller size.,65807,3
65808,"Product was okay, but sleeves too narrow, even when ordering a larger size.",65808,3
65810,"Look cute on, I got tons of compliments.",65810,3
65810,"However, after about 48 hours of continuous wear one arm fell off.",65810,3
65811,"Very cute top - however, runs extremely big.",65811,3
65811,I ordered a small and it fits like a size Large.,65811,3
65812,This is very pretty - except that it is extremely hot.,65812,3
65812,The material under the lace is very warm.,65812,3
65813,Went down a size and it was still very loose.,65813,3
65813,It was also longer than I expected.,65813,3
65813,Ordered the Red and Olive green.,65813,3
65813,Red was not as pictured so I was definitely disappointed.,65813,3
65813,The photo makes it appear to bright read.,65813,3
65814,Style not as expected.,65814,3
65814,Just didn't like how it hung or the fabric,65814,3
65815,Material was cheaper than expected.,65815,3
65816,"The shirt is nice and of decent quality, but as soon as I took it out of the package, a button popped off.",65816,3
65816,"Unfortunately, I don't know how to sew, so I will have to go without it.",65816,3
65818,around hips somewhat smaller,65818,3
65820,Accent with Color and Style!!!,65820,3
65820,"Run small; no problem, just get 2 sizes larger than you would normally order.",65820,3
65820,"Beautiful colors, nice light material ( so you can wear the completed look with a Jacket and not be a Sweat Hog!!!",65820,3
65820,I have Lyme disease.,65820,3
65820,Lyme live in your gut; and give you this tummy.,65820,3
65820,Add one of these jackets to your outfit; and only you know that.,65820,3
65820,I like the way they complete an outfit.,65820,3
65820,"I live in Houston, Texas; and it is hot and humid.",65820,3
65820,"This way I can add a light Jacket for style, color; and camouflage!!",65820,3
65821,Has puncture marks on back,65821,3
65822,"It was a pretty color, but it just fit strange, and if your tall, its not going to work as a dress!",65822,3
65823,It was too small in the bust and too big around the body.,65823,3
65823,The strappy part was loose and hanging.,65823,3
65824,"I am 4' 11"" tall.",65824,3
65824,"The neckline dips one inch low, and shows bra straps on the corners.",65824,3
65824,I am sure the neckline is just fine for people of average height.,65824,3
65824,I'm very disappointed because it is such a lovely dress.,65824,3
65824,So sad I can't seem to find RTW petite vintage dresses.,65824,3
65824,"I sew my own vintage dresses, but it costs so much more in fabric and time to sew my own than to buy one.",65824,3
65825,Just add a cami underneath and jeans and you are ready to go!,65825,3
65825,"It's a very warm sweater, great for a cold winter day or night.",65825,3
65825,I love the button embellishment.,65825,3
65825,It adds to the overall beauty of it.,65825,3
65825,"*Update - after wearing this sweater for a few hours, I was itching like crazy.",65825,3
65825,"The buttons would come undone by themselves, the holes must be too big.",65825,3
65825,"I washed it once, in a lingerie bag, gentle cycle, cold and hung it to dry.",65825,3
65825,The sweater is falling apart!,65825,3
65825,"I literally own almost every Pattyboutik item, in at least one color.",65825,3
65825,This is a disappointment.,65825,3
65825,I've NEVER had issues like this with Pattyboutik before.,65825,3
65826,"The shirt itself seems decent quality, but even though the size medium is described at a 7/8 it runs small.",65826,3
65826,Maybe a size 5/6 that is closer to a solid 5.,65826,3
65826,My son will only be able to wear this maybe a handful of times.,65826,3
65826,Assuming it doesn't shrink too much in the wash. :(,65826,3
65827,Love the material and print....top of pants could be longer.,65827,3
65827,As I work out I find myself pulling them up pretty constantly.,65827,3
65828,Received glasses in the mail and checked quality.,65828,3
65828,A little annoyed with the fact these arrived warped.,65828,3
65828,Set them down on a flat surface and they wobble around.,65828,3
65828,They also do not sit on the face evenly.,65828,3
65828,"The do not, unfortunately fit my face well.",65828,3
65828,They're too big or not angled enough to wrap around and flow with my face well.,65828,3
65828,"The lenses are very dark, which I prefer.",65828,3
65828,Frame quality appears to be good.,65828,3
65828,"The eartips, starting from the temple, is made of plastic and may possibly be broken, but if there was anything to impact these enough to break that plastic, the frames would bend or lenses would pop out.",65828,3
65828,"They arrived well wrapped, lenses protected, and had a protective cloth bag, also with microfiber cleaning rag.",65828,3
65828,"In short, item arrived warped.",65828,3
65828,They do not fit evenly on the face.,65828,3
65828,They do seem to be built with quality though.,65828,3
65829,The stitching is not really sewn to stretch...which should be expected for active pants.,65829,3
65829,They fit fine with plenty of room but as you stretch them just to put them on you can hear the stitching breaking around the waist band.,65829,3
65830,They were smaller than expected.,65830,3
65831,"I wish that I could give this 5 stars, but the length is so off.",65831,3
65831,"It feels weird wearing it because of this, and you can tell under clothes.",65831,3
65831,"The sizing was good, and so was the fit.",65831,3
65831,I guess you have to be a midget or already have a flat tummy to wear this.,65831,3
65831,But I will say that my posture was amazing for a few seconds.,65831,3
65832,"This is a pretty umbrella, easy to ""tote"" around because of it's small size.",65832,3
65832,"However the one I received does not Auto Close as advertised, although Auto Open works just fine.",65832,3
65833,Love the design but the fit doesn't match the description as posted.,65833,3
65833,So snug that my ______ 's extrude outside the pouch.,65833,3
65833,Don't even want to bother with the return (if that's even possible).,65833,3
65835,I give the suit a 3 because the bottoms were so tiny!,65835,3
65835,I also needed to wear a sports bra under the top to keep the gals in place.,65835,3
65836,It was a bit snugher then I expected it to be for a men's medium shirt,65836,3
65837,So very beautiful just way to small,65837,3
65838,definitely does not look like the pic.,65838,3
65840,"Comfortable, but the heart on the end fell off after about 2 weeks and was lost... replaced it with a charm that I had laying around so it still works fine.",65840,3
65840,Would be better if the heart charm was placed on better so it didn't come off.,65840,3
65841,"I like this piece, it is very cute but whenever I wear it, the pedant falls off.",65841,3
65841,It could easily get lost in the streets.,65841,3
65841,"The necklace is a piece of open wire that goes around the neck so it shifts while you walk and before u know it, it falls off three or four times within an hour",65841,3
65843,"They came a bit bent from the hook, and for some reason my ear gets extremely red when I wear them.",65843,3
65844,This necklace is really nice but I thought that it would have been more sparkly in person.,65844,3
65844,The chain itself appears to be more chrome than silver  but it is still beautiful and eye-catching.,65844,3
65845,Really cool but didn't fit,65845,3
65846,"It's not terrible, but just not what I expected.",65846,3
65846,"The white is a bit see-through so keep that in mind, but you could easily put a slip underneath.",65846,3
65846,"The shipping took almost a month, which is another downside.",65846,3
65846,"I think the dress looked a bit cheap, which for the price is accurate but meh I would pass on this personally.",65846,3
65847,After multiple requests for different measurements I was told they couldn't guarantee fit and would not accept a return so we mutually decided to cancel the order.,65847,3
65848,This necklace is beautiful and it fits how I expected but the gold is already starting to fade at the connecting chain,65848,3
65849,They're to big I'm gonna return them.,65849,3
65850,What I received was exactly what I was expecting.,65850,3
65850,Seemed to be made with good quality.,65850,3
65850,The reason for 3 stars is the size of the two openings.,65850,3
65850,"They are pretty small, so before buying, make sure your sunglasses have relatively small ends or else you'll have trouble trying to force them into the two openings.",65850,3
65851,The price was too good to pass up.,65851,3
65851,I love Swiss dot.,65851,3
65851,"It is a bit large, and is not wrinkle free.",65851,3
65851,However it is light and airy and perfect to wear on a hot summer day.,65851,3
65852,Love the suit but the bottoms was a lot snug on me and I'm quite small actuall so they didn't fit at all,65852,3
65853,The neck is stretched out looking....more like a cowl neck instead of turtleneck,65853,3
65854,"As other reviewers said, way too much material in the back making it bag out and look funny.",65854,3
65854,Too bad is cute from the front.,65854,3
65855,Great shoe but is much smaller than average same size.,65855,3
65855,By at least a whole size.,65855,3
65856,"They are fine, nothing spectacular in terms of fit, materials, design etc.",65856,3
65856,It wasn't a Prime Shipping item and I think it took two weeks to arrive.,65856,3
65857,good for the price but i normally wear M and ordered L because i read the reviews before and it is small still,65857,3
65858,Size was perfect for my mom,65858,3
65859,This looks like a great bag when zipped.,65859,3
65859,The expanded version is H U G E. Fabric appears sturdy and bright.,65859,3
65860,Very large in busy area,65860,3
65861,"I ordered a small, the package the costume came is says ""small"", but the actual tag on the costume says medium and it is too big.",65861,3
65861,I need a small.,65861,3
65863,It took a while to be delivered.,65863,3
65863,I bought it for my 11 year old daughter to carry around her personal items in school.,65863,3
65863,From the pictures I didn't realize how large the purse was.,65863,3
65863,It was too big for someone her age so I let my coworker have it.,65863,3
65863,She absolutely loves it.,65863,3
65863,It is my own fault for just going by the pictures and not checking the sizing in the description.,65863,3
65864,Not what I expected but still happy with purchase.,65864,3
65866,The color is not the same,65866,3
65867,"Perfectly what is shown, however, I wear a medium and ordered a large, while the fabric is very stretchy, it is certainly TINY.",65867,3
65868,had to go back !,65868,3
65869,Very pretty but I didn't realize the inside spins around.,65869,3
65869,That feature kinda makes it look cheap.,65869,3
65870,Material is thin and a little rough on skin.,65870,3
65870,Was looking for more of a cotton like fabric.,65870,3
65871,the large fit snug and the material is cheap polyester looking so it doesn't as great as the picture but..,65871,3
65872,"The cut is ideal for layering, hiding both stomach and hips.",65872,3
65872,I wear a 42F bra and was worried it would fall open but it hangs nicely in front.,65872,3
65872,But it clings to my back and sides even though I picked a larger size than I needed.,65872,3
65872,It's just the material that makes it so clingy.,65872,3
65872,It is quite thin.,65872,3
65872,"That also means you get zero warmth from wearing this, it is just to hide the bulges.",65872,3
65873,It broke within the first month that I was wearing it.,65873,3
65875,Item was not longer then my waste and I and 5'7 however still received plenty of compliments,65875,3
65876,My daughter purchased this and wasn't please by two things.,65876,3
65876,"One, the stitching from the words scratched at her skin.",65876,3
65876,It didn't not have a shielding to cover up the stitches.,65876,3
65876,"Second, she stated that the sleeves were too tight.",65876,3
65876,"This is an eleven year old, slender female.",65876,3
65876,"It should have fit a bit big, but instead fit a bit small.",65876,3
65877,These fit as expected and the colors were good but were WAY too long.,65877,3
65877,The picture shows them stopping mid thigh but these came down to the top of my knees.,65877,3
65877,"They are too long to wear under spring dresses, so I will have to hem them.",65877,3
65877,"Other than that, they are good.",65877,3
65878,I got a size too big and it was still too small.,65878,3
65878,That or I just don't want to be able to move,65878,3
65879,"I'm 5'4"" and 130 ibs.",65879,3
65879,"It's such a cute dress but when I reviewed it, it already had a rip in the arm.",65879,3
65879,I sewed it and tried the dress on and the arms were a bit tight.,65879,3
65879,I would've gone with a medium so I can bend them better.,65879,3
65879,"But other than that, it's a decent dress for the price.",65879,3
65880,"Not extra big, not extra wide brim.",65880,3
65880,Can pass to young granddaughters.,65880,3
65881,"The color was way off, more burgundy with a red bow!",65881,3
65881,"I like things to match, so it really bothers me!",65881,3
65881,If it was red on red I would give it five stars!,65881,3
65882,thin thin thin shipping was good  seems to be ok in craftsmanship no flaws seen so I like but not love,65882,3
65883,"Ordered my size, didn't fit.",65883,3
65883,"Sent back and reordered, still a bit too small.",65883,3
65883,We're trying to stretch them now.,65883,3
65884,Warm but a bit bigger then I thought only the pans the top arms could be bigger,65884,3
65886,This cardigan is stretchy.,65886,3
65887,I'm very petit and because of how low rise they are the back only comes up half my cheeks.,65887,3
65887,It wants to creep up further but then it's too tight and chafed.,65887,3
65887,Most make things have the opposite problem and rise too high.,65887,3
65887,Otherwise good pouch and materials.,65887,3
65887,"Not dissatisfied, but had better female things.",65887,3
65888,These jeans are adorable however they run extremely small...I plan to save them for next spring,65888,3
65889,Received the wrong color,65889,3
65890,I like them a lot but they are crooked.,65890,3
65890,I'm going to try and fix them without breaking them.,65890,3
65891,"It's having a large size, I didn't expect this size to keychain.",65891,3
65891,But the material is very good,65891,3
65892,"The bikini is a very good product,  good quality,  but it is too small for be size S.",65892,3
65893,Pretty but a cheap products.,65893,3
65895,Would have liked the material a little heavier.,65895,3
65896,Numbers on the outside of the watch started rubbing off within a couple of hours of him wearing the watch.,65896,3
65896,It was the main reason I chose this watch.,65896,3
65897,"Although I ordered bigger than my size, it was still too small.",65897,3
65897,I did not know he came in a smaller size.,65897,3
65897,I did not know where it was shipped from and it would take a lot larger to ship.,65897,3
65897,I ordered another one in a larger size because I truly like the designs in it.,65897,3
65898,"I could have done without the SB on the back, but it gets the job done.",65898,3
65898,"It's very snug fitting, as promised.",65898,3
65899,"The print is not as detailed as the photo, but serves its purpose as a cover up.",65899,3
65900,This top is more tight than other Patty tops that I own.,65900,3
65900,"It's tight in the sleeves and the airport areas, but also in the chest area.",65900,3
65901,had to get sized that costed more then dress....paid $54 for dress cost $125 to get hemmed & fitted,65901,3
65902,I am surprised that this is a good brand and pants cut is reduced.,65902,3
65902,I bought the goods before and had been very satisfied,65902,3
65905,I like but was a little snug,65905,3
65906,"Ordered an XL
Fits like a M
The fabric is adorable though.",65906,3
65907,Great beach cover up but first time wearing the elastic at very top gave way.,65907,3
65907,I am not large at all so that was a downer.,65907,3
65908,Fit isn't true to size.,65908,3
65910,it's ok. wouldn't buy again but no complaints,65910,3
65911,"Super cute, but run small.",65911,3
65912,arrived on time and the product is good,65912,3
65913,I'm a little disappointed because the package I got was different colors than this photo.,65913,3
65913,I really wanted the light colored panties and instead got darker ones.,65913,3
65913,They do fit and alright and are 100% cotton which is what I wanted....so half right.,65913,3
65914,It does make a difference.,65914,3
65914,Lifts and tightens everything.,65914,3
65914,BUT the bottom part holding your butt up folded and rolled too much making it look awkward in jeans.,65914,3
65914,I'll just stick to squats ha.,65914,3
65915,"In the boob area, it was too loose.",65915,3
65915,Like it would shift on one side and the opposite nipple would try to slip out.,65915,3
65915,There is major side boobage.,65915,3
65915,"Also, the straps do not really stay in place on my shoulders, unless I am perfectly still.",65915,3
65915,"I hope it does better in the water, I am keeping my fingers crossed because the suit itself is just like the picture!",65915,3
65915,"The bottoms are not bottoms, I am wearing a thong, which I do not mind too much.",65915,3
65915,Maybe the bottoms where just a tiny bit too small?,65915,3
65915,"I got a size S and I am 5'3, 124 pounds and I am B cup size.",65915,3
65915,I also have a pretty full bottom since I weight lift so maybe my ass just sucked it up?,65915,3
65915,"Either way, I am really looking forward to trying it out in the water but I will have my boobs taped so there is no nip slips!",65915,3
65915,"Thick fabric, fast shipping and much like the picture.",65915,3
65916,"I ordered a large because normally I'm a medium and the large is even tight :/ other than that the shirt is cute and I love it, but the cartel ink logo is a lot bigger than expected.",65916,3
65917,"Nice looking, but were too big.",65917,3
65917,"When I opened the package, I thought they were, but wasn'twasn't sure.",65917,3
65917,"When I whipped them out to get them pierced, my piercer recommended I get smaller ones, so I did.",65917,3
65917,My nipples are average size.,65917,3
65918,The elastics fits like a medium not an extra large.,65918,3
65918,"Dealer agreed to take item back, however It could have cost more to send it back than to have it altered.",65918,3
65918,Will not buy from this dealer again.,65918,3
65918,2 stars for the item.,65918,3
65918,4 for customer service with company,65918,3
65919,Ordered 3 pair 2 fit as per label the other pair seemed to be a size smaller even though it was labeled the same size,65919,3
65920,Nice quality but the hat gave my son a horrible rash on his chin.,65920,3
65920,I think it was may have been the velcro rubbing or could have been from the fabric.,65920,3
65920,He has very sensitive skin.,65920,3
65920,He can only wear the gloves.,65920,3
65920,Both are nicely made and seem warm.,65920,3
65921,Bottoms in picture looked like a cheeky or Brazilian bottom but are full bottoms and the top is too big.,65921,3
65922,"Like this, seems to run larger than normal",65922,3
65923,I was disappointed because thy came with a whole in the crotch.,65923,3
65923,I bought other pairs and I love them.,65923,3
65924,I got this pretty necklace thinking that it would look like the picture I'll dazzling beady you look sharp wearing it with anything in your wardrobe.,65924,3
65924,"Boy was I wrong, this piece was another disaster looking piece.",65924,3
65924,If only they came like they what did the picture I would be a happy person.,65924,3
65924,Because I do love some necklaces.,65924,3
65924,I know it's costume but still the same when you get it you expect it to look like it does in the picture.,65924,3
65924,This was another disappointment in the books.,65924,3
65924,"I would not recommend this necklace anyone, in fact it is still brand new and I am thinking of returning it because of false representation of not getting what the picture shows",65924,3
65925,would have loved these if they would have fit.,65925,3
65925,I wanted to order another sz.,65925,3
65925,but they did not have the sz.,65925,3
65925,I needed I ordered a med.,65925,3
65925,needed to order an xlg.,65925,3
65926,Its a nice design and everything.,65926,3
65926,But its a little tight around the toes.,65926,3
65926,And the back of the shoe digs into the back of my ankle.,65926,3
65926,Kind Pains to walk.,65926,3
65926,Would recommend anyone buying to buy a 1/2 size bigger to avoid this issue.,65926,3
65927,Does what it's supposed to do.,65927,3
65927,Has Serman Brands written on the back of it which I'm not a fan of.,65927,3
65927,I'd rather have my own personal name on it.,65927,3
65928,They are little hot and does not have enough ventilation in my point of view.,65928,3
65928,"If outside is cold it will be ok, but if not, they are a little hot for me.",65928,3
65928,"I am not sure if I can open a hole in the sides, does not have instructions for this.",65928,3
65929,Quality was not as beautiful as on the picture.,65929,3
65929,I looked like a 4th grader dressed up as a fairy for halloween.,65929,3
65931,All the other reviews say to order from Trumps website.,65931,3
65931,These aren't from Trump's website and won't help the campaign financially so it's up to you.,65931,3
65931,The shipping was also slow.,65931,3
65931,"So giving 3 starts for that reason , not the hat quality, which was fine to me.",65931,3
65931,The  liberals and Ultra Conservatives love it when you walk by with this on and smile.,65931,3
65931,Great piece to wear to start a nice peaceful conversation.,65931,3
65931,Make America Great Again!!!!,65931,3
65932,fits well at the hips.,65932,3
65932,but shoulder are large.,65932,3
65933,ordered a larger size as I read from the reviews.,65933,3
65933,It was too large for me so there for I can't wear it.,65933,3
65934,i just don't wear it alot but it fits and the company was nice to send me a larger size when i contacted them.,65934,3
65935,Comfy and really breathes.,65935,3
65935,However if you have any hips whatsoever they will likely take some adjustments to get them up there,65935,3
65936,Seams inside pockets  started to come apart after only one wash. Back zipper pocket came apart after only one week .I was forced replace and sew in Velcro which works better then the cheap zipper,65936,3
65937,"The large is very tight on my chest, but is too big at my hips, belly, and sleeves.",65937,3
65937,"However, I do like the material and pattern, perhaps, this will be a better option for my post-pregnancy phase.",65937,3
65939,I love the dress but it is to small.,65939,3
65939,I need to return it.,65939,3
65940,"I bought these to use with a pair of screw-back earrings that I could no longer put on by myself, thinking they would be secure...I've now lost one earring and one back.",65940,3
65940,Not so very secure after all.,65940,3
65941,The inside by the zipper part was caught and it was coming off.,65941,3
65941,Cute but it's thin.,65941,3
65942,It's just OK. Not as flattering as I hoped.,65942,3
65942,Doesn't lie as nicely on the shoulders as this photo does.,65942,3
65944,Good for its price.,65944,3
65944,I paid less than $2,65944,3
65946,Needs to be returned to big around the waist,65946,3
65947,Nice blouse but didn't fit.,65947,3
65947,I wear Xl or 1x.,65947,3
65947,Ordered 3x and still too small.,65947,3
65947,It fit extremely tight specially around the chest.,65947,3
65948,Bag is cumbersome as an across the body bag.,65948,3
65948,The handles are a pain as I prefer a shoulder bag.,65948,3
65949,Pushing fingers or out of gloves removes multiple threads.,65949,3
65949,"Order several dozen, as they will probably be good for 5-8 uses, and then will unravel.",65949,3
65950,"this watch looks nice, but the band appears to be very thin and weak - not for every day wear",65950,3
65951,It fits nicely but I don't like the thin cotton material.,65951,3
65951,I guess you get what you paid for.,65951,3
65952,Order one size up.,65952,3
65952,Other than that great color and screen printing.,65952,3
65953,Very cute but the rim is.,65953,3
65953,It solid so it sites down on head rather than protruding out like it should.,65953,3
65953,Comes off of my 2 month olds head a lot,65953,3
65954,Perfect but littlebit smaller,65954,3
65955,This is not tan as pictured.,65955,3
65956,"Very cute, except for the little bow on the back which I'm trying to remove without ruining the top.",65956,3
65956,"Fits a bit smaller than expected and, though I allowed for that, the size makes me feel larger than even I think I am!",65956,3
65957,It's smaller than your average large.,65957,3
65957,Also I thought the pants legs were longer like the picture but they stop closer to the knee..cute tho,65957,3
65958,Doesn't stay on my kids head very well.,65958,3
65958,Also hard to get on to a squirmy child.,65958,3
65959,"Took three weeks to get here from China, and it's way too small!",65959,3
65960,I was really excited about this swimsuit.,65960,3
65960,"It was cute, it was plus size and a good price to boot.",65960,3
65960,When a finally got it (a week after the ETA) I was still excited.,65960,3
65960,It was vibrant and looked like it had great support.,65960,3
65960,Unfortunately the cups were far too small for me even at a 5x.,65960,3
65960,The bottoms fit perfect at least and are a gorgeous color- gave the top to my sister and it fits her perfectly.,65960,3
65960,Just a shame the cups don't go bigger than a D.,65960,3
65961,"Neat design, longer than expected so it covers your neck well.",65961,3
65961,"Unlike everyone else here, I did not receive a discount on this item.",65961,3
65963,"The Good:
-I love the color (I have the coffee color - a nice deep brown) and style of this bag; the straps are a good size to fit over my shoulder, and I like having the option of a cross body strap as well (the strap can detach).",65963,3
65963,It looks like a higher end bag without the hefty price.,65963,3
65963,-It's a nice size; I can fit what I need plus some.,65963,3
65963,"It also has a few inside pockets which are fairly deep (can hold some pens, chapstick, small pack of kleenex) and an inner zipped pocket.",65963,3
65963,"-I like having the outer zip pocket; is just the right size to store my phone for quick access (iPhone 6)

The Bad:
-THE SMELL.",65963,3
65963,"I have tried and tried to get rid of the ""fishy"" smell, but it still has an odor.",65963,3
65963,"I've tried wiping and spraying with vinegar, spraying with perfume, dryer sheets, etc.",65963,3
65963,but the smell is still there.,65963,3
65963,"It's not as potent as when I first received it, but it still has an odor after all my efforts, and if I put things like my fabric lined wallet, makeup bag, etc.",65963,3
65963,"inside, they take on that same smell.",65963,3
65963,"I'm not sure how to permanently get rid of the smell - if it didn't smell so bad I'd bump my review up to 5 stars, because I like all other aspects of this bag.",65963,3
65964,too long for me - returning,65964,3
65965,It fits a bit tight .,65965,3
65965,Just a bit .,65965,3
65965,It will be a good addition to my wardrobe .,65965,3
65966,It looked like a long sweater jacket but is regular length.,65966,3
65966,I would like it better if it was longer.,65966,3
65967,I ordered a 3X.,65967,3
65967,This is the smallest 3X I've every had.,65967,3
65967,It fit my niece who wears a small.,65967,3
65967,"Other than that, it a great tank and quality.",65967,3
65967,The only reason I give it 3 stars was because I was able to ice it to some one and the quality of the tank.,65967,3
65968,The bottom hem curves up when washed and won't stay down,65968,3
65969,Cute but bares a lot.,65969,3
65969,Will be having a cover up over them,65969,3
65970,"I am 5'11"" and weigh 220lbs and it is small in the crotch and restrictive but the fabric and design are awesome.",65970,3
65970,Just needs some extra room for the boys.,65970,3
65971,"In the picture, it looked like it was an infinity scarf, but it is not.",65971,3
65971,"Great scarf, but don't be fooled",65971,3
65972,Ordered 2 sizes up and it was still to small.,65972,3
65972,"I guess after I lose 5 more pounds, I will fit.",65972,3
65972,"I expected the US/Asia sizing to be different, but geez!!!!!",65972,3
65972,"But, hey, you get what you pay for and since I didn't pay much ... what can I say??",65972,3
65973,The fit is fine but the collar is noticeably weird...you get what you pay for though.,65973,3
65973,I don't wear it out.,65973,3
65974,Good but not great.,65974,3
65974,"The fabric contains lots of nylon - it is very see through, you must wear it with something underneath.",65974,3
65976,The top was way too large so I washed and dried it in dryer.,65976,3
65976,Now it fits good.,65976,3
65977,I received my shipment promptly.,65977,3
65977,The heel lights are not as bright as the ones I had before (another brand).,65977,3
65977,Snug fit which is nice because when I run I hit my heels together and usually knock one off.,65977,3
65979,I got this item really quickly and it is very pretty.,65979,3
65979,However two of the gems were broken off when i opened the package.,65979,3
65979,"For a one time wear item, it maybe too expensive.",65979,3
65980,"As A Magnetic Titanium Bracelet, it look true to picture and not at all heavy as others I have bought.",65980,3
65980,"This is mainly due to fact that unlike the ones I have owned the past, it has half the magnetic pieces.",65980,3
65980,"Now depending on the amount of discomfort and reason for buying it, this will be a factor.",65980,3
65980,"For me, it meets me needs in both the look and purpose.",65980,3
65980,Partly since I get them to pass as a bracelet and the magnetic.,65980,3
65981,"It's pretty cheap looking but ok, I will wear it with casual summer clothing.",65981,3
65982,These look super cute with dresses and jeans.,65982,3
65982,Can wear them comfortably for several hours.,65982,3
65982,Thinking of adding som me inserts.,65982,3
65983,Got them fast and fit perfect !,65983,3
65984,They are light and can be worn with anything practically.,65984,3
65985,super thin and flimsy,65985,3
65986,They were bigger than expected.,65986,3
65986,Really hard to close to make smaller.,65986,3
65987,"Item is quite small, about a quarter of the size of a regular pocket-watch.",65987,3
65987,"As one might expect from the price and the fact it ships from China, the quality is anything but remarkable.",65987,3
65987,"That said, for the price it is crafted well enough.",65987,3
65987,The white bubble 'eye' on mine had some chalky residue and the white line at the top of the eye is not a reflection from light.,65987,3
65987,"It's just what it looks like...a white line, LOL Easy enough to set the time for anyone familiar with pocket-watches.",65987,3
65987,Comes with no instructions and is shipped in only passable quality materials.,65987,3
65987,"Bottom line; if you want a cool, kitchy little party favor or bobble, then this is a great purchase for you.",65987,3
65987,"If you were looking for something a bit more fancy OR functional, well then....keep on looking, LOL",65987,3
65988,MATERIAL IS TOO FLIMSY AND ITEM IS A LITTLE TOO LARGE,65988,3
65989,"I wish there was an option to mix sizes because I'm pretty bottom heavy, so the bottom fit fine but the top is huge.",65989,3
65989,Cute though if you have the boobs to fill it.,65989,3
65990,A little short if you have a booty,65990,3
65991,I thought I was getting something more leather looking.,65991,3
65991,It's more plastic than I wanted.,65991,3
65991,"However on a good note, it has a lot of room and pockets which is exactly what I was looking for.",65991,3
65992,"Its cute, but fairly cheap.",65992,3
65994,The product size was rather too small as compared to the normal large sizes that we normally use.,65994,3
65995,Sizes run extremely small...i wear a 1 and these were absolutely huge on me.,65995,3
65995,They def do not goby US sizing...love these still...might just re order a smaller size,65995,3
65996,Yes wish got a half size smaller,65996,3
65997,Shrank over a few washings,65997,3
65998,I got the costume in a large and it fine pretty well.,65998,3
65998,If I had the option of going one size up I would have but a large was the biggest size offered.,65998,3
65998,"The glow of the costume was amazing, I got so many compliments.",65998,3
65998,The only can I have is that of the of the printed skeleton began peeling before I even tried it on.,65998,3
65998,Once the costume was on it was pretty noticeable that it was peeling.,65998,3
65998,I tried to glue it unsuccessfully.,65998,3
65998,This is the reason for 3 instead of 5 stars.,65998,3
