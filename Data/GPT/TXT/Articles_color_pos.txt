the lor and fabric is beautifulIt's so soft and fits perfect so I wanted another in a different lor.I really liked the lor, the multiple mpartments, etc.Bought the black one and loved it.its baby blue and white, not the lor pictured.The lace is white and not the pretty beige lor that is on the model.They are not dark at all.Although very pretty it tangled so easily and turned in lor within wk.One of the letters on my shirt ) is ming off right out of the package.Turned lors after daysIt mes with white lor figured.It is more of a royal blue.Its too bold.-Completely different purple than photographed, it is a bright orchid purple, not at all a dusky soft, heathered purple.The red is not red it is pink.The red is ral, the yellow is lime green etc...Was orange, not peach...not true to photoLiterally one of the pearls wasn't attachedThe photo looks amazing but i can't say the same when I receive it.These gloves are very soft and have a vibrant lor.I bought the black one, and it was pretty.Also, the dress is a light lavender lor, which I wouldn't mind if not for the reasons listed above.This is not at all what the photo portrays.The other had lights that would stay red.Turned green and the diamonds fell out (I ordered the black hat with white print.Not at all what the photo portrays.The lor is not the same as I chose and sleeves are too longlor changed within one monthDefinitely not as long as the picture either.turned black after few wearsThe ring iacute;tself looks beautiful, but lost its metal shiny lor and turned my finger green.When offering a broad range of lors choices to be exact) you should either a. supply the choice(s) purchased or b. make it so whoever is packing the box knows which lor is which.Now, I ordered the burgundy set- which, in the picture, looks burgundy.When it mes, my set is RED.Maybe... if I was looking for a regular" lor blue, green, red as opposed to navy, olive, burgundy).Purchased mint, product lor not as shown.Turned out to be a dark, pavonine green... Nice lor, but not what I had wanted.The photo is different to what I received, huge brazalet, the yellow ball is huge and doesnt looks as nice as picturedShower curtain I received was blue and red, not scarlet and gray.Blue lors bled into the white area.The pants came in a creamy lor instead of the white as advertised.The lors we nice .Bought a pair of the gray ones thinking they were not see through but they were.What we got was a tie that was black and blue.I purchased the yellow jeggings and was so excited when they came I had to try them on...I was expecting a faded, grayish black lor but it's more of a khaki lor.Would have kept it if the black hat were actually the lor I was expecting.It's not the same lor as the picture, the top doesn't match the rest of my dress I ordered the blue).It's more of a green lor.Brown patches are not nice at all.The jeans was not the same lor.I think they should have been black or pink.It's unfortunate, the style is really cute and the lor looks fabulous on tan summer skin.If you want this for display then buy it.It came with only lors.I received a - month in pink.Color was sharp.Cute dress and great lor on line.Need a black but not offered.Was more of a peachy pink.Funny because I ordered the blue from another seller and it was the same material and fit great.In the picture it looks pink being the reason I ordered it, but it's red ugh.See photo.The lor was the only thing that was the same.The lip lor is NOT bright pink it is pastel pink.Thought there was some black in the set but it's just a reflection on gold.The light is to yellow.I didn't order the green one, but that's what I got.I ordered grey and they sent me baby blue.the lors are way/ off and the flare isn't as nice as in the product pictureThe lor it wasn't what I expectGreat lor though.I ordered the white one with the sky blue printsColor is not like it looksLeft a green mark on my girlfriend's finger.It fit ok and the lors were beautiful, but the lors would NOT stop bleeding.The lor was very orangeThe red is pink.NOT non-polarized.Received another in BLACK instead.Did not reflect picture.Dress is a not a royal blue but a darker pastel blue.Super cute, but I am a - and ordered a X thinking I uld wear it leader in my pregnancy They do light up.it was not as depicted when I ordered it.I ordered the purple as shown, The lor I received was anything but.Color and sizing are NOT as stated.I decided to buy the gold and the silver.I bought black, silver and gold.I wanted to buy another set green gold/multilor) but now I am changing my mind.LOVE THE COLOR.The blue is not a dark blue at all and the dress is longer than I expected.Color is off-white/beige.Does not match picture.Ordered the beautiful red lor.Pretty lor.Not beige.The lor was lighter than in the photo.The lor was pretty true to the picture, but I returned it because it just didn't look good on me.The stripes in person are more defined and looks very stumey.The charm is dull and dark in lor.Turned my finger green and not happy with this at allThe dress in this picture is black and a light pink, the dress I received was navy blue with gold.I would have preferred to have the pictured patterns.And definitely not polarized.The lors are cute and my daughter loves the set, so that's why I gave it a .I have several of the shirts and I love them all except for the black.The fabric and lors on model are mpletely different.Boooooo...I got this dress in a white, yellow and white...yes, THREE of them, that just shows how much hope I had for them.the light blue is right in the back area if you are not a short girl.The prints and lors are different from what I ordered.The lors where majorly off from picture.Plus these had bright pink ties.He doesn't understand it has to be returned so we can get him another brand.Not silver after days the ring will start turning your finger green.its an off yellow and purple with electric blueNot soft pink and cream..I hate itOn top of that I didn't receive any red and only blueColor was good though, exactly the lor I wanted.It is mpletely see through and lors are not bright.Other than this, the lors of the item I DID receive were nice and bright.I didn't expect it to be cashmereI ordered that were slightly different styles and I was excited to wear them.He especially liked the different background lors for the light.But on a positive i loved the lors.Not sure if these were previously ordered by someone with a ton of cats and dogs and then returned, but i ordered the black and navy blue shorts and both have a ton of fibers/hair on it.Definitely not the same as the picture.The lors are way off.Picture shows red flowers.The lor and stitching is nice however....Three brown, four gray, and two burgundy.Do not like the lor or the material.The lor are lighter then the pictureI purchased a small in the lor black.turned lors after a day of wearing it..the quality is just not good and the lors are NOT bright like in the picture.Not light blueTeal or aqua blue maybe?Update: the black lor is starting to me off.These are not purple.They are black with a little gray/ The shape is nice but the lor is not what is pictured.pink is not the same shade as in the photo, lace is not as wideThe lor and fit of the suit, I LOVE IT.Nice lor but these are definitely not made for the average lady woman...When it arrived the shirt is white not light blue.We simply saw the lor....Now I know better.... Should have read the lor:(.This top is not cut as it is portrayed in the photo.Also, I would have liked that these me in black but uld not find them in that lor.Cute for a few hours changed lors the same day I got them.The lor is as it is in the pictures.COLOR NOT AS EXPECTED.It was a white tee with blue writing.I brought the red and the tan.It was green turquoise and I wanted blueI recieved a bright red, white and green hat.Color not what shown.The skirt I received was dark pink on the top and bottom and light pink in the middle, not white.Does not look real at all.The shirt I received is more orange than pink.very vibrant lors too.Colors great The lors are nice and they fit well but ironing for that long isn't worth it.ordered fuschia received pinkAlso the base lor is more white than purple, but that's the least of the problems.This dress looks amazing in the photo the lor is beautiful, the style is beautiful.The sizing runs really small and the print lor is not a true dark blue.Selected small, burgundy dress.The pale pink or blush lor that is advertised is not rrect.Charts were not accurate It has a brown strap, brown piping and a beige bow.Turned orange after wears.COLORS ARE A BURGANDY NOT BLUE OR GRAY.I wear a ladies .The lors were gross and the design was mpletely different.First of all, the shirt is a pink, almost purple lor not very realistic loring and the nipples are on the side of the shirt a good - inches from where they should be).I bought the green one and it's pretty see through.I got the black pair, which are a little different.It ok the picture was betterThe lors were different, it was too long, and it wasn't flowy AT ALL.ALSO IT'S NOT THE COLOR IT SHOWS ONLINE.The lor was accurate and pretty though.I also want to add that the nude lor is the most yellow looking nude I've ever seen.Pretty dress but lor was not even close to what was shown online.Colors were lively.Great lor, but beware the sizing.changes lor too fastVery different..It had little white spots on it.i bought both the black and the gray as i wasn't sure which lor i wanted.When I receive my dress it was lime green and not at all true to the lor in the picture.My daughter loved the lor but is very disappointed now, and we need a new back packRead the small print and look for vendors who,offer free returns The yellow is not mustard like the photo it is bright/light pastel yellow and you can see through the material.The lor and design are beautiful.The lors are not as pictures.I ordered two pink earrings and received one pink and one green.The green one is not very pretty.The picture shows a kid.The rrect lor.Size in burgundy is not the move the image on the left is the original gownThe print and lor is nice but the material was a big let down.DO NOT TRUST THE PICTURE I GOT GREEN BLUE LENSES.The lor is more light denim than the picture shows.I order different lors from this necklace for presents.Oh, and my white one has a chest pocket only, the black one has round waist pockets.I ordered the pink and received the purple instead.So I currently have an obsession with purple and was hoping this would be a new mfy pretty shirt.I ordered these in ivory but they were yellow when they arrived.Beautiful upon first glance but expected the ribbon used to lace up the rset to be black like pictured but it was bright blue.Turned my neck all green.Hi, my husband ordered these for me the black with pink stripes at the bottom).I love the lors.Also more of a light blue shade than white from using as little ink as possible to print the shirt.It turned pper lor and now is blackI got this after finding and loving the floral print version.These were totally NOT what the picture showedThe pinks and greens are orange and blueThe lors are not soft grey and black it reminds me of like brown poopI purchased this blouse in two lors.Pretty lor very roomy.Don't purchase this item in purple" if the lor purple is truly what you want.Thus, one would expect a mpany that manufactures and sells products in various lors to know that difference.Now I'll have to search again for a appealing purple shower curtain and hope that it is indeed purple when it arrives.It is not magenta or pink Cloudy lor.I was also not thrilled with the light purple lor I bought, it was a muted shade and didn't suit my skin tone.Just look at the photo - what you see is truly what you get.Loved the lor but not the fitThe lor.The size is very too large and the lor of the A alvin) is not yellow but orange...Turned my belly button green.Ordered from active elements, ordered the large multi lor, and small purple monarch for kids.They are both white and have short sleeves that is it.The fit was as expected, great red lor and cute style.And yes I got authentic bepei" Pros Great lor saturation.I got the green.The picture made them look very lorful and fancy.These are mpletely different from what I've received.The gold metal is three different lors of gold.They are polarized, which I verified with my mputer screen.Not as pictured, my daughter liked the red version of this so much that we purchased a blue one.Here I got upper part of the shoes with light green lor and lower part sole) of the shoes is very dark green which is mpletely not matched.She chose this for the pattern which looks better in the picture than on the actual dress.The lor is sorta very pale beige and not pink at all.They were rose gold, not yellow gold.The print on this dress is critical the the style.It is not very sparkling and isn't as pretty as it appeared in the picture.The lor is nowhere near light blue They're dark blueColor doesn't match the pictureLook at the pictures to see specifically what I meant.The white is also not white.It's more beige than white.Color of stones are not so shiney.I really love the style and the lor so I look forward to wearing it.Plus the lors are not the same as shownIt is a bright Halloween Orange.Love the lor and the shape, love that it's a backpack and a nice size, but it's not usableThe lor came off in days.You can get a t-shirt and iron on your own letters better then how it was done on this shirt.I wanted the navy/gray/white.The lor I received was black/white.Beautiful lor, absolutely no label or cleaning instructions anywhere.They were all slightly different lors and the only one that fit properly was the one for the baby months old.Well made and the lors were very pretty.the image is not mpleteSee photo...Beautiful lour.this shirt is NOT flowy, NOT, cute and NOT the lor it says it is.I got the green and pink one thinking it would be the cute green and pink it is in the pic but Its litterly Christmas lors.This dress is not as advertised in the photo.I was hoping for them to be gold as they look in the photo.. but they are definitely a rose gold.There is no red its peachy lored.Had to return, lor is more red than I thought, not burgundy.Nice lor.Not at all the print that was shown in the picture.This is no different.I actually ordered sweaters at the same time same style, same lor) and every single one of them is a different quality, different material, and different fabric??Was so excited these in the mail--The lors are beautiful.I love the bible verse but they faded in a week or so plus I love the lor but lors aren't vivid enoughI was so ready to order other lors but I think not.Does not match the picture.I like the lor.I bought pairs in different lors... shouldn't of done that.not the same lors as described or shown.Nice lor thoThe lors weren't as vibrant as the picture either.And why ask if you want WHITE OR IVORY?So in the description it says gold.This is not gold at allTurned my finger green within daysThe only positives:) lor I got multilored dress) ) size description buy sizes up, I bought L for an american S) accurate.Awesome ring, after a few weeks ring lor faded.I ordered raisin" and the pants I received are pure red.I ordered WHITE and got a BEIGE oneits orangeColor not as shown.It's a neon bright orange.Color is more pink/salmon than red.The strap was wrapped in PINK newspaper for shipping.. NOW THE TRAP IS PINK... total waste of my money I wish I uld've given ZERO starsThe lor grey I ordered is actually a light blue.The lor on the mputer matched the lor swatch from his dates dress.When it arrived, it wasn't close to the right lor.It's stark white.True blue-blocking sunglasses will block blue light.You put these on, and there is no difference in lor when looking at blue objects.No the lor was not expected to be that brightI had purchased this blouse in an orange lor and loved it.I ordered this in white, extra extra large.(brown)to small, random lors, no basic standard lors.Ordered wine red and got hot pink.It was off white.Turned my finger green right awayThe photo not clear Order white I received black don't like the all black never wore it The dress was not what was pictured.I bought a black and white one, both the same lengthThis dress is my as lored.So I saw these in my favorite lor and thought, ok sure.I liked the lors.one received is red with black ntrasting lor.They do not glow in the dark.(see THOSE pictures too).This is the mparison of the outfits when received.It's more blue grey and too light.Picture B is what I got.I'm terribly disappointed b/c I love the lor.Do love the lor thoughAnd they tested out as polarized.The dress I received is not the same as in the picture.The picture and the dress is not the same.Plus, the balls aren't lored anything like they are in the image, they're more like pearl derations than opals.It would have been better I'd they just kept the bold within the circle.Turned my wrist green the first day I wore itThis shirt is listed as red but it is pink.Ordered the dark grey, and it's very light.These are not good at all they change lor in a week don't buyThe dress I received was not what was pictured.Also keep in mind that the lor was very different, it was much darker almost an orange lor.Not blue and white.Red and blue lors overlap to create a brown navy lor.As you can see from the pictures I did not receive the fancy" version.The only things rrect about the picture and description were the lors and the fact it's a long dress.not as seen here lor is differentThis ring changed lor within two months.The rose gold looks more gold than rose, in its new state.Not same print/design as pictures.After wearing this for awhile the lor wears off.These are not polarized, as advertised, and the trouble to return them sts me more time and effort than they are worth.The pink is actually blinding neon pink.They're OFF WHITE.Not at all how it looks in picture.The muted pink version is actually neon/hot pink.I ordered silver it came gold not what it looks like in picture either it satisfied.The picture and description are amazing.Turned my girls finger greenColor, quality, style was perfect.As well as the lor.I received red.The stripes were bright pink, not red like shown in the picture.Even when washing with like lors and dark lor safe detergentWas not happy with the lor at all.There's a dark line running down the center and it is two toned.I like lorit bears not resemblance to the pictures.I was very pleased with the lor, which is a pretty pink.Nothing like the plain black and green pairs that I currently have.The lor shown is NOT what I received.They were a very dark, almost denim lor.Everything is like what it is in the without them picture only yellowishFrom other reviews, I expected this dress to be a much lighter pink.Pretty lor, I will give you that.The picture is not what you get.nasty''''''.But they only me in black and dark brown, but their quality is excellent.It's green, which is importantlors and fabric is nice but, waaaaay too small... will be ordering from S to L. we'll seeColor and size still wasn't right after following the sizing chart.Nice lors, but the dress had in a lot of holes.They're all the same lor Turned my finger green right awayFirst off, the lor wasn't what I ordered.Spent more to have it altered.Other than black and grey,(must have used black and white photography) there is no lorNOT RED, like I wanted, it's more of an orange.Left pic is what I thought I ordered, right pic is what I got.Also I ordered it in gold and it's not gold at all its pinkish.The other lors are made of a light and thin material so they glow as expected.I may have written each of them i bought ) I. g different lors x each well the gold and silver have already broken on me.And the chart doesn't match upYes it was the same lor and design but the style was different.Take a look at the picture.Based on the images I was expecting this to be a deeper purple, however it is more of a light lavender lor.Its lors are more black and white than silver, navy-black white.After day at school all of the lor had worn off the toes.The lors also aren't as vibrant.Too small and lors are flourescentI really like the print (Turned greenIt is red, white and BLACKDefinitely is pink.I was thinking it would be red based on description and pictures.The lor is nice.This dress was not the dress in the photo Not the right lor as shown in the photos.It's more of a peach lor.The newest one which Royal Blue faded even after less than washes.In the first picture the straps of the Royal Blue have the original lor which is vibrant.I ordered the white gold and received the gold ones.I've received my order and I feel happy because of the bright lor.The actual rims are bright pink not the lenses.It is red.The fan I got does not match the picture.I have a navy blue pair that are nylon and they are much softer and more breathable.Colour is accurate.The lor change is permanent.The lors are much bolder in person.Also, the green is very lime green.I love lor, desainer, may be keep or return?The lor of this is not pink, it's more of a peach.Was not as long as it looks in pictureit was much more HOT pink than blush pinkThe lor not as shown.Such a shame because the print is beautiful.The description said red.I got bright pink.NOT WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURES.Print is not bright at all very faded letters and Sparkle" not a single sparkle anywhere.I will be spending money to add lor myself to have the shirt she wanted.Got the gray.Colors not as advertised.Sweater was a bright red think Valentine's Day red not the maroon lor shown.The sweater is as shown.Color is more teal than blue.One maroon and one navy blue.Also, I ordered the charal grey.The lor in the picture show the lor under the lace was charal grey but it was silver.The gold is more yellow than rose goldI wanted it burgundy as shown.(light blue)ALSO the lor is NOT powder or baby blueIts is light teal.More green and no where near powder blue.And three, I ordered black, it's definitely navy blue and see-through because it's so tight.Wasn't black first of all.It was more of a gun metal grey, which is fine except that it wasn't shown that way.The white is totally see-through.Completely not what was represented.the top is a faded blue lor and the shorts are royal blueWas not happy overall with the order.The print is not what is shown in the picture.Its isn't rose it is light brown.Didn't realize it was neon lors.NOT THE RIGHT SIZE NOR COLORAlso, the dark purple lor is a royal blue lor.Not purple at all.All four of mine are the exact same lor and picture.The lor is more of a burnt orange than tan.Loved the lors.I so wanted to fall in love with these but the face of the sunglasses are a weird yellow orange lor vs a true gold.It was not this bright fun pink, but more of a ral lor.Not at all how it looks in the picture.The lor was niceit was just plan light brownThe only thing nice and this jacket I the lor.the lor is two-toned and not mplimentary to each other, not what I thought I had ordered.The lips aren't pink they are yellowThe lor is very cuteThe lors are the same but how they're distributed is totally different.Different shade of brown.don't buy.. not right lor, fit funny, and tried to return and uld notThe top I received is not beige with soft lors as depicted in the picture.I did not get the dress in the picture.The lor online is a multi-lor holographic" design; in person it is pretty much gold-lored with some holograpic reflection.The green is actually pretty.I received it in a lor I did not order.I do not remmend the lor whiteMaybe the other lors would work better.Also golden lor is not around all the product so I will ask for a refund and it looks it will wear off very fast with a normal use.Turned oper lored after useAll trim is navy blue while stripes are black and whitelor is niceI ordered the lor stripe assorted and got pairs of white socks and one pink pair.Not as depicted.Pictures look nice, but what you got is mpletely different.I got this in lors for my daughters.I ordered the E/F/G and I can't imagine it would fit more than a D. The print is very cute but the top is not sufficient.Picture is much better than the dress.I chose blue as the baby is a boy.Please know that these tights are a light Neon green lor.I thought they would be darker from the picture.Changed lor within two weeks of use.I loved the lor, but didn't like how it was made.It was already changing lors by the time it arrived.The sweater I got was not the sweater I ordered.Colors are not trueThe description says different lors, but received lors not black or brown that were needed.The lor of the fabric turned out to be a solid baby blue lor and not at all the denim look I was thinking.The blue is cholate Browns and teal not black and grey as it looks.The pink is dark gray not w any taupe or softer worn look of lor to it.I did not see review about material or lors.Was expecting better print.The description should be Pale green" or Green Mist".My daughter wears a t so I ordered a t.Fits well and looks like advertised except instead of a rosy lor as pictured a darker pinkish hue) it's red bright bright Christmas redToo white for ivory lor and the edge wasn't very niceNice at, lor is a little off.I ordered khaki and it has a pink hue to it.Definitely not made for women of lor with hips and gluteus maximusIn person the lors are dull darkWould not have ordered it if I had known it wasn't a shade of brown.Beige is a light brown lor not yellowI didn't get the lor I want, it wasn't like what I see.Turned brown almost immediately.Turned my ears green.One in black and the other in blue.Because some of the lor came off.Love the print, but just can't keep it.It is not the vibrant, summery green depicted on the model, but rather a more muted lor.My deadpool logo was pink and not centered.you do not receive what is advertised in the picture.I loved this lor I did not receive the lor pictured not happyThey are hot pink and blue.Might be ok in another lorBut even after soaking in salt water for two hours as suggested the lors still ran.I was hoping for a rose lor like in the picture.I got a magenta/fuchsia.It's still pretty lor, I guess, but I really was hoping for the rose red lor.The pattern was not as nice in person.The lors are also not as bright.Color is dripping from area it was intended to be and is visible on gold around those triangles.Got the pink one, lor is very faded peach.The lors looked good.I got the black and pink' dress.I thought it would be a light nude pink but NOO it's not AT ALL like the photoColor was as shown.After that time it started turning a pper lor.As you can see in the picture it is no longer silver, but pure pper lored.I was expecting more of an off-white than yellow.I haven't had it a week turned my finger greenI love the style but not the lor is not like the pictureColor was way off.I ordered the grey and the lor was more off an off white/cream.I put the Orange Color shorts through a regular was without any bleach.The lor ran.Was really excited to get some underwear for my husband in ol lors.The lors are great but the fit is not.The light works fine with the green lor, but hardly at all with the red lor.Will not order this brand again.Turned my finger green the day I got it, haven't worn it sinceThe lor is not as great as the picture..Beautiful lor and pattern but is hugeI've just received this and it appears to have been crunched at some point.The green is more a puke green than the vibrant one shown.They aren't the lor/tint shown in the picture.They are a rose gold" not a genuine gold lor as displayed in the photo.First, the dress is off white white with a yellow undertone.Colors are extremely brilliant.Only thing was nice was the bright yellowI chose the burgundy dress.Id like no star.I ordered the dark green emerald) lor, which is more of a pastel.The s ale of the pattern also does not match the picture as well as the lors.I only got one, gray......... all other lors out of stock, waiting.Charged lorsColor is not as pictured and not as pretty.Also, this is listed as a women's..they send me different lor make me surprise.Picture is an adult.Super sad because I loved them but I would stick to the basic lors as the pattern ones are not made with as strong material.The purse looks way more peach than pink.The green was a puky gross lor green.Like the heading states, we hand washed them assuming the sizing was rrect.Not as expected picture shows two tone the Rings are only one lor silver Not the lor shownIt was gold and yellow not ivoryI RECEIVED A LILAC one.It was a beautiful blue/green that turned into grey.Loved the look of these but had to return them.Initially was excited as they were cute and lorful.I ordered a blue set and red set.The one shoe has an off lor light as pictured.Color is niceBeautiful taupe lor thoughIf you're wanting the lors/prints pictured, don't get these.More like orange don't like.The dress is definitely not like the picture.I should have returned it but I loved the lor and style and wanted to try it.It was not silver.There is no chiffon in the Chiffon Colorblock" dress.The sequins weren't what I expected.BRIGHT PINK, don't forget to put on your sunglasses for this shirt.The lors were a far cry from what is shown and described on the page.Not the lors I wanted.This dress is not yellowIt is more like lime green.Turned lorsGold dark like midnightThe picture is not realThere was a blue dot on the bottom green part on one of the earrings.Color was not aprit.It's straight up green.I don't like the lor and the material.I ordered a black and received a white instead.Does not look like any of my real gold jewelry in the k to k lor range.Absolutely loved the lors and how they looked.Turns greenThink Pepto Bismol pink.I also ordered it in hot pink and it is bright orange.Try a different brand.Color.not a true white.Definitely more gray or blueI ordered orange, and the top I received was a pink/peachy lor.This is not red.It was not burgundy.I got a bright red dress with black and white stripes on the top.Bottoms are not navy blue, which would've been cute.They're black and white...which is not so cute.Was not as it looks in the images.It is neon green.Color is about it.I've worn Degrees yoga pants forever, usually ordering black.The item is not matching the description, the lors should be assorted and I received all in gray lor.I ordered this lor thinking I would get some mellon/creamy lors.I received the day glow version of all of these lors.Think highlighters with some navy and not attractive at all.Don't buy if you're looking for pink.They're not pink.The pattern matched the picture, but that's about all.Color is red not burgundy.I bought two more lors.They create a wavy image when peering through them.As stated in other reviews these are maroon red and not pink, and do not fit Olympic sided " barbells.First, the lor sweater I received was a much darker purple than the pink shown in the photo.There's no design printed anywhere on this shirt.They weren't the lor i wanted.I wish i uld have a refund or the right lor.Color is as described.Looks bronze Not happyOrdered the purple and the multi lored.The shirt is actually a Christmas green lor.Not at all like the details in the photo describe.My understanding was that Italian" sterling silver did not turn black.The canvas lor was off from what I expected.The belt does not match the design lors.I did not order this, at first it was showing a heart bracelet now a necklace I don't want this give me what I paid for a heart braceletEmblem was pink, not red.Its Gold.And not as turquoise as this picMore Green with GOLD (Looks okay, the yellow is a cute lor.Gaudy gold lor.Color is pretty.I got the white one with the straps in front.It's not as it look in the picture really .. even the style is not as goodIt doesn't reflect what the photo shows at all.If you don't mind having a bright shiny yellow earring, then get them.They were definitely not for me and I wish the description and photo reflected the product.This literally failed in every single way, except the print, which is lovely.Loved the lors tho.The lors bled in ld water) from the cuffs on the pants to the white stripes.This seems nice but the lor style is more for an older lady.Polish came in black and a neutral clear, no brown polish present.Like the lor and weight.The lor was pretty but that was all,EFF all these online photos.The want me to take pics i don't know how and they know how it looks because they sent it to me.Thought I was getting light blue, but they are dark blue.I was expecting the dress to be light baby blue, but it is actually teal blue in lor.I ordered the white dress in x.However, a uple of weeks wearing them, the shiny silver lor turned to pper, and my finger turned green.The Color Its Not Even The Same I got Another Pink.I was expecting a dusty pink like in the picture but instead I got a baby shower pink I didn't like it.Lovely jacket, the lor was beautiful but it runs very small.The lor is more caramel lor than the cream lor shown.These are blueLoved the lor though.Turned my daughter's finger green first dayOn the first and only) time she was able to use it, the purple washed mpletely off in a normal pool.It is not silver.Color offI ordered three different lors white, black, red all size M, because I uldn't decide which I really wanted.The item displayed is a vibrant green.Maybe the black would have been a better choice.I bought the purple one for my mother she had it on for hour and washed her hands and three of the diamonds around the heart fell out.Color was not vibrantThe lor is a vivid royal blue.The lor was a bit different to the photos as well.It's a very light grey.The ring is turning black and turns my finger lors as well.and it's not black and red it's black and purpleColor is not as shown in the picture.While the lor matches the photo, that's the only thing.The image of the black cat is not centered properly.It is royal not turquoise .. Other than that I like it.Color was not as depicted.Nice lors.The picture is bolder in lor then the actual print.Fingers and rings green after one wear.The shirt I received is NOT by Simply Southern at all.Some of it was a rose gold lor and some of it was yellow.lor is not as brilliant as pictures on amazonHad ring for a week and it turned pper lorI received two different lor shirts all marked the same lor days before my wedding.The black lor is painted on and wearing off right out of the box."turquoise" is a blue far from what the pic shows.It was silver.I thought it would be white not cream lored, I need to send them back.It is beautiful and I was very disappointed in the sizing.The green" stone did not match blue crystals at all.The lor is definitely not the sameAlthough this lor yellow(almost a butter cream) is my favorite lor I was looking for something more brighter yellow like in the photoThe O is now a pale yellow.the earrings are two different lors.And the cross slips out of the infinity symbol.I am livid.It's bright red, almost pink looking.Its not sterling silver... Its fake and turned my finger green.Beautiful lor but one of the balls fell off after wearing a uple of times.It had little green spots in the lors.I have this in three lors.All dark gray.Not only was the lor mpletely off, but the shirt was to large and curves out a bit as if it were destined for a girl.the lor is way off.I ordered the purple and I got a very ugly lighter purple not very appealing lor.I will have to dye the dress to hopefully get it to a decent lor.It's not real silver only plated.TOTALLY DIFFERENT PICTURE TO FOLLOWThe lor is ALOT more of a pale pink, and the skirt is see-through.It was also pure white and not cream.It doesn't light up.Ordered the charal and it is purpleDefinitely clashes with the rest of our lorsThe lor is definitely a bright red and NOT a wine lor AT ALL.The lor was true to what I was expecting, but that was the only thing.Decal is adorable but that's about it.READ THE FINE PRINT.The bezel is also a matte rose gold but in the picture it is a shiny gold lor.I received rose gold, not yellow goldThe lor of the shirt in the illustration is not what I received.It is much darker, and yes, has a pronounced woven pattern.It is not what I nsider a traditional chambray cloth shirt.I aas expecting to get a huge skull printed shirt with bright pink lors.The bottoms does not match the top but i can mix and match it with other bathing suits I haveI uld have just spent .- and gotten a really nice jacket.Find these printed tights with a BLACK background and you will be goodIt's a very cute at but definitely not bright yellow as pictured, more of a yellow ochre.Received red mittens instead of the lor variety as promised and outlined in listing.They are a light green instead on a darkish green.I ordered this because I needed a white purse to match my shoes but it is more of a tan lor, Not whiteI received a navy blue plaid shirt which instantly threw me off.Plus it isn't the right lor.I received it and the lors were rrect I got the tan lor).Nice lor, though.The lor is close to what it shows, but a bit lighter.Colour: The yellow I received is NEON yellow, too bright.The lors of the lace sleeves were a darker shade than the body piece.I would have liked them the same lor.Flat, dark black.The lors are not as pictured.great lor but xxl is not a true xxlThe other lors show a distinct straight line in the front opening, but not the blue with elephants on it.Thought the lor would be camel and it was orange.i love it but the lor changed within daysIt's actually navy blueThe lor is not a true black.Color was right I guessOrdered black, but is blue like blue jeans.Its a red lor.This strap is supposed to be white, but it's a soft pink, also pretty sure that when I ordered it, it was called light tan, one of three lor choices) but I definitely don't want pink.Lastly, the chain is a different lor gold than the closure.Plus like others have said I did not receive the lors shown.It is definitely blue.Not a grey/light blue, they're almost a royal blue, and the crystals are not in the same pattern as pictured.I received a black one with polka dots....it's cute, but not what I ordered.ITS CUTE NEVER TURNED JUST WISH IT WAS A LIL THICKER BIGGER IT FADED QUICKLEY (It really didn't care for the lor.It is only black and white.The lor I ordered was charal, but the lor I received is more of a plum/brown lor.It IS a beautiful lor.This was BRIGHT pink neon really.I felt like it was too Barbie's lor for me.The bag is nicely made,but it is NOT pink.These r very cute in the pic.I got ones that were just one lor.Not very happy to say the truth, the dress is two different lors, brick red up top and orange below.On the positive side, well, I ordered red and it was a true red lor.Definitely not the same sweatshirt pictured, lors are bright and bold.Don't believe the picture.More black and muddy than blue and gray.I thought it would be solid blue if I picked the blue.At least it's black, I would not get this in any other lor for sure.Really liked the lor But they do not offer bigger sizes in this style shirt.. returned it.They are also warmer than standard unlined spring/fall leggings and they are dark winter lors.The lors are very nice, but I think a child would be the only one that uld wear this as a dress.The logo is great but I was hoping for a real sweater.The accent bow we received was not turquoise, rather it is a light pink lor.It is more of a standard, pumpkin orange.We did not receive the pictured prints or lors.It is way bigger than what I expected and lors are not as bright as shown in the picture.I got the gray" leggings, and they aren't a true gray they are brownish.Color is totally not as pictured.I loved the lor, but it was made very small.My charm did not have the green cz like the description says it has.They can make a nice gift for someone who loves dogs and the lor is very nice.It's a bummer because I love the lorThe lors of red and green in the stripes on the pants do not match the red and green in the shirt at all.This turned out to be yellowish cream lor, not white.cute but after a few weeks it changed lor.. not sterling silverFrom the picture it appears to be just black which is what I expected and wanted.Other than that they look true to the picture.I ordered purple, but the lor is more of a pink/magenta, than purple.The lors were nice and bright though.The white really stands out.With in weeks of wearing this the skull has changes lors, the silver has worn offColor, design and fit not the same as picture.Color is brighter than I expected, the material sticks to the body.Color and fabric were as pictured/expected.Did not fit as expected and delivered with the black lor bleeding into the beige lor on the dress. pair fit OK solid lors).Each lor shows the rings in a SET of TWOI ordered pair in different lors.Kept the Black and Grey ones.I got this bra in black and white.the lor is not the sameOtherwise the lors are nice and bright.The black doesn't ver it the right way.I totally got suckered by what looked like a really ol print when I bought this.In reality the lor is totally different, not modern at all.The only nice bright lors are beautiful Now they won't light up at all.She was really happy for that time when her shoes would light up now she just wears them because she likes the lor blueIt was in well nditions but they didn't give me the rrect lors...Two teal strands and a dark blue one.I just wished they got the lors right.The dress is such a pretty lor in person and is flowy everywhere except through the chest.Color was nice.Color is greatIt's more like a baby blue.This jacket is a very bright pink think pepto bismol pink).I ordered the blue navy with all lor hearts.It's as white as can be.It's not a solid lor all over.Love the lors but not big enough.Not the same image as pictured in photos.Color is vibrant and is super long I'm '").Not the dress that is pictured.Bean, E. Bauer, etc.Very bright but I like itItem was too large and the lor was not good, item has been returned.I ordered an XL in a few other lors which fit well.I don't like the lor.its ok, but not as cute as photo.I did like that they were light and mfortable and I love the lors, but I ended up having to purchase a different pair.I didn't get either blue as well.Do not buy this set if you're hoping for a certain lor.Cool pattern.I ordered the apple green shirt.Nice lor though.When I received this tie, I found the green background of the tie was green with tiny white stripes, rather than the solid green I was expecting.The lor is actually more of a salmon than orange like I was expectingIt's more light skin lored a peach hintIt does not flow that easily and is red, not orange, also no blue; the lors are red, black and brown.The lor and gold highlights might work for some but not for me.Turned my finger green after days.I'm so sad that the navy didn't fit properly as I would have purchased more in different lors but these pants are not nsistent in there sizing don't want to chance it.style doesn't look as nice in real life as it does on picturesThe ONLY reason it got stars is because of the cute print.Not the lor shown in the picture.Bright cardinal red is not burgundy.The lor is as shown.it turned brown after a week of wear indicating its not sterling silver.is it just this lor?Otherwise I like lor and lightness but worry about a big trip with no extra space.it doesn't like it looks in the pic.Not bold and lorful like it looks in the picture.Beautiful greenThis dress is not as pictured.But I like the lor.Definitely blue.Not those which we were expecting also the lors selected and received are different.It will only stay red and does not change to any other lors The left shoe does everything it's suppose to and it's really ol.Lots of choices of lors but they haven't lasted more than a day or each.These are not great for the gym because any amount of sweat is really obvious because of the lorI have this in other lor patterns and this was not my favorite material for this shirt too thick and didn't hang well.The lors are also far more bold, heavy on the red, than shown.Too thick and too brightOnly perk is that it was true to the wine lor pictured.I was hoping for more of lady rn but it was more of the other characters also lors were more muted.The yellow was too neon for my preference.The lors are bright as shown in the pictures and they are easy on and easy off.Plastic...more gold in lor than anything.And with the bright lor, it would make a good carry-on for a child, plus it's very identifiable for a baggage claim area.It's a shame, too, because I really did love the lors, fit, and styling of these.The gray stripes are blueThe stars are for the lor it's fun but I can't use the suitthe tail lor came off almost immediately.It didn't work with my skin lor.The lor of the bag, grey, is not dark which is why I ordered it.The lor is more like a faded olive green.Color was as described.Fun lor.Ordered in gold but got silver.I will be sending this back not sure if I loved it enough to get a different lor.Colors weren't the same as pictured.Loved the lor but too wide.Two stars because they at least look ok.The lor is too light its more like orange not tan.I bought the dress in two lors, but I'll be returning both, as they are too painful to wear...I wanted it to be long like the picture.The at is not the blue jean lor as shown in the picture.Its a much lighter lor.Package is marked white, but gloves are beige at best.The print is cute, and I did get mpliments when I wore them.Pocket is black not navy blue.Nice lor but since it won't lay flat I don't like wearing it.Was really upset because I love it love the lors the style.Don't buy it's not the same as shown in picture.The stume that I received is gold and black instead of white and black.I wanted the dress in the picture.It turns out to be on the pink side rather than a true purple.The graphic was ok.Image was not as clear in real life as in the picture.Why is it okay for these sellers to say TURQUOISE?"These are not turquoise.The lor wasn't exactly as shown in the picture it's more of a orange-gold.Definitely NOT whiteColor was nice, but too playful animated for my taste.Color was not adequate or true to pic.The only good thing is the lors are great which is why I gave this stars.Pretty lor and fabric.I paired it with a white cami and a burgandy cardigan.Not black and white.I have these in other lors and I love them, but the pale pink lor is more beige than pink.Color is wearing off since ated in lored paint.I got it in dark blue so I can't speak for the white or lighter lors.I WOULD MAYBE HAVE BEEN OKAY TO HAVE CLEAR OR WHITE BUT NOT GREEN ....YUKPink is alot brighter than expectedAfter it arrived, I immediately noticed the front image wasn't white, but a very dark gray lor.I have one pic of him with everything.The lor is much lighter and not happy with the material.Was disappointed because I really liked the lors and design.The mocha-gray lor look brown-beige.Rather than a royal blue as pictured the blue is paler and the fabric does not have any gloss/shine to it.Not nearly as vibrant in lor.And not exactI was expecting black like in the photos and movie.The burgundy was too small throughout, and the blue was just baggy and inches longer than the burgundy.I love the black and grey striped.LOVED THE STRIPED ONES.And then there's the lors and the patterns, which are described as ethnic."I love the lor and the material but it was not big enough.The sweater itself is really cute and I liked it, but I ordered an XL.Single black would have totally been fine.Color like it..design owseme..size to small.. XL would be great.....I ordered the blue one with the silver" top.I have dark red shoes and was hoping it would match.Its bright crayola crayon red.Plus, the sizing was a bit small and the lor wasn't the best for me redhead).Perhaps in another lor, this would be better... just be aware that it will show all your tummy flaws.The wallet had a pattern, but had no suede.It was super cute and the lor is very bright.Color was lovely.Received a navy blue one that was not even an option.It is all white.The picture should be updated though.Color not expected..more a yellow and it was super longMade somewhat small and lor is not as appears on website sky blue) its pale blue not bright.My outfit is the lor I ordered, black.Colors are nice, would not buy again because fit.I got the lor jade because my original selection of turquoise was no longer available.I received three black, two shades of grey, and a blue hat.Three Captain America ends, one plain silver.I liked the lor.Only giving two stars because the print is cute.Cute style.I didn't received the lors that were displayed in the picture.I received black, dark grey, light grey and a burgundy.Well I loved the lors but even though I ordered up it was still way to tight.Color was awefulIt is actually a light brown lor.Light too brights uldn't see.Otherwise, I love the lorsWhat arrived was a brown belt with a subtle orange-y tint.Not orange at all really.The lor is off.I ordered a green lor which is more of a light mint green rather than an emerald sea green Not all lors are free returns.As for lors, I first thought I ordered two of the same shirts.They are very close in lor and need bright light to determine which is black and which is navy.Not exactly the lor I was going for- it won't be a daily belt for sure.Love the grey lor because it is subtle and can go with a lot of outfits.The lor is nice but the shoe is extra wide.I have worn this twice and each time I had a red wrist.I love the lor and feel of this skirt, but I went with everyone's suggestions and i went bigger.The picture is not the same dress.The lor is bright.Otherwise ok glasses for the price.This dress is totally different from what is shown in the picture.The lor is nice but the material seems like a two dollar mask.The back of the skirt is solid maroon.When the item arrived it was not the lor shown.It's a very baby blue in lor with magenta ears.In a different lor and with short sleeves, this would be good as beach, casual wear.I like silver so I will wear it.This not maternity friendly, at least not in the aprit lor.Not exactly as shown in picture.I ordered this in white, and I got baby blueI bought this dress in XL in orange and love it so I decided to get it in blue and it was so small it is a shirt.The lor in the dress fades when you put the dress on.Color not as described.Ordered wine red and it is a very bright cardinal red) not a deep red or maroon/burgundy lor as pictured, otherwise looked nice and fit as expected.Yes it's set however it's not gray and black it's blue and whiteCould work in darker lors for a basic plain dress if you want to weare a winter vest over it or something else to jazz it up a bit.Beautiful dress, the lors exactly like the picture, But very small.It's changing lors alreadyThough the fit was great and the lor is pretty; it truly is a nice dress.Other than the odd lor the design was exactly as described.its nice but they're not follow what is on the picture I order same what in the picture a ffee brown and I received dark ffee brown ..It is as pictured however and is beautiful and vibrant.its not as big as it shows in the pictureThe photo of the ring shows a light-lored stone with turquoise and blues but when I received the ring it was a dark-lored stone, still pretty but not like the stone in the photo.It's cute, but PEOPLE IT IS NOT GOLDThe lor is beautiful tho.The lor is not exactly as shown either.I got light blue and when i ordered it It was a turtle neck and i would not remmend it but it was mortableThis dress is pretty designed.Color is true to picture; loose batting is truly loose.There are white streaks in the black.There was only one gold toy in the box, and only one chain silver lor).We are returning the box because the lor of the toys received is not as advertised all should be gold lor, like in the photo).And the lor is more of a dark tan than a beige.The loring has rubbed off so now it is not rose gold.Too orange...They shirt is really a nice looking shirt, BUT I ordered different lors of this shirt.Color isn't vibrant.Colors were pretty but thats about it.Product I received was green not black.Not the same lors as the photo.Sliver Color silver is the only thing that is good.The lor has faded very quickly leaving it a yellow/gold lor; no more pretty rainbow.Liked it, just wish red was more on the red side and not rust lored.The lor is as pictured and it looks great in the picture.Not as vibrant in lor as the pic but the top being a large fits about a size b cub.. Not my DD size cup It is NOT burgundy with ivory flower and soft green petals.It is actually bright harsh red, with bright white flower and florescent green leaves.Love the lor but run smaller than the solid lorsIt is not navy blue it is royal blue.As other reviewers mentions, the lor me off easily.Other than the lor ming offf, it is good.The lor on this dress says baige the lor is actually a peach lor.I ordered the dress for my sisters wedding and the lors for the wedding are baige and browns.I bought the Tiffany blue" for my brother's wedding lor theme.When I got the ties, they weren't Tiffany blue at all.That all being said, the quality is good and the lor is beautiful.The lor was vibrant.Maybe in a different lor,it would be better.not the same lor tie I ordered with the shirtI wanted to add this to my llection due to lor, price and style.I don't know why or how it happened but I am not happy though the lors and quality are good.The lors toward the top of the dress are not lors that look good, AT ALL.The lors were great.Color of gold is brassyI ordered the Black Static Floral and I don't know if it's just this pattern, but it is definitely see-through.See pictures belowThis is not the same sweater shown in the pic and it's not pink it's Fuschia.I would like a more dyed look. of the scarfs were fine the rd one has a pink tint to it.Not that dark.It's white so it goes with everything.not as bright as photo looksIt's doesn't for as pictures.I love the lor.On the positive I loved the lor.It's a beautiful and bright lor.Beige maybe but definitely not nude.Recieved pairs of the tiger eye and pair of the white when I ordered this...Disappointed because I really wanted the green ones, which is why I decided on this set.Not to mention I ordered the pink print and got a black one instead.If you aren't sure which lor, do not get yellow.The hip bands are vibrantly lored.It's a beautiful lor blue but certainly not a dress on me.The lor of the actual dress is lime green not that beautiful green in the picture.This is not lored metal.The lors are nice.The lor definitely does not match the one in the photo, it is more of a ruby red.It may be a blue zirn" but the stone in the ring I received is GREENI ordered the six-pack of dark lors some of the lors aren't very distinguishable between others.Some are clearly the lor stated.It change lor immediatelly.It is more of a pale yellow.I love the lors tho.Not the vibrant blue as pictured...Just like the other review, the shirt I purchased had white lettering.The pockets are oddly placed, lor was brighter than anticipated.The print was nice.The only reason I gave it stars is that I love the ncept of it, and I love the lors.Pretty lor but % see through.I didn't get the lor I ordered.Nice print.I am bummed as I love the lors and really wanted to like it.The lor is pretty.Mine is faded similar to the pic but not % satisfied but was only about Green is great lor, great thin material for summer.The charm is darker than the picture, rather dark green and blue.It is a disappointment that picture did not reflect the true lors.After short time of usage pendants start get in bronze lorSo I ordered this jacket in brown.If I wanted a black jacket i would have ordered the tarmac lor.The only thing that was true to the picture was the lor.Pretty but lor is changing to bronzeThe lor and quality were very nice.It isn't orange, more of a rust lor.I thought it was yellow with a yellow interior but it's yellow with a pink interior.I got the white and it was a bit see through, it would probably be best to get in a darker lor.It's cream with white trim.They are VERY DARK blue.These are not light blue.Beautiful patter and lor.It is not exactly as it shown at the pictureThe lor is neon ral It's about as big as the picture.I had this shark belly button ring for less than a month and it's already changing lor.I really wish the sizing had worked out because I love the printGot the blue bird design.Love how it looks except for the ugly light yellow pee loration... so the birds are ol.Would be a cute dress if it was shorter and the rrect lor.I think the lor isn't so ugly but with my skin tone it doesn't look good,would look nicer and darker skinThe lor was a beautiful dark blue.I purchased in three lors.Nice green I was disapointed.wish I had gotten the grey.The Red lor is a bright, almost orangish-red instead of the raspberry/burgundy lor depicted, and the Turquoise lor is actually, definitely a medium-light blue.These lors don't do for my wardrobe what I had hoped.The lor was not as described.It is more of a peach lor than pink.The lors and design and sizing are exactly as described, it's just not very wearable.Love the lors in the fabric.Color off....The purple mitten is the glove we bought from this set mpared to my daughter't glove from Burlington Coat factory.due to all the sequins.I did like the fabric lor choices.It looks dark blue fresh off the press The paint was wearing off and the silver letterings didn't stand out .It is a very pretty, deep wine lor.My cards were showing out the top of my pants.Love the lors.It would look really nice but the lor is not the lor shown in the pictures.My hair lor is very light so I ordered the light ash and bleach blond and I got something that was a light brownish, off blond lor.The lor was what I expected.It's reflects are minimal for the size and d" loring it mimics.I ordered the Black Charal" design and had to return the it as it was a different lor scheme than what I ordered Light Gray and Black).I reordered the Black Charal but received the Charal Black" design instead.It is ral not pinkNice looking ring, BUT, turned lor very quickly and left lor on hand after first wear.Expect the lor is the same.Colors are bright like the photo but not true to size at least for me.Under the lights in the room in which I opened the box it looks pink and white.This is a really beautiful product - the lors are vibrant and both I and my stepdaughter - the recipient - loved the design.It's like a rose gold lor... Not to fond of, Only because the other one I wear on the other ankle is more like an k gold lour.Given the picture and description rainbow" I was expecting bright lored gloves.It looks like a real XS The lor of the top is not as shown in the photo.The lor I received is a very dark blue, almost a sapphire blue and has quite a shiny sheen to it.The print was more blue than black and low resolution.The lor is also not as vibrant as pictured.I loved the vibrant lor, but the dress was slightly large and it puckers at the neck line.The lor is actually cream and black, not white and black as pictured.The green lor is way lighter the green in the photo.More like a yellow-green lor.You can see the lor of my areolas nipplesTurned my neck green.looked more pink in the picture and it was more tan and light brownlor is not what is shown on amazon.lor is turqoise but is actually a deep green.More like salmon and dark brownThis is not same product as what is displayed when buying it.This is not Silver it is Silver plated.It is roes gold not gold.I bought of these red and black) and love them.One star for the fact that product was specified length and lor.The style is not as pictured.I purchased in different lors.And the lor is not as vibrant as it was advertised.Not truly whiteThe top is not like the picTurns my finger greenThe lor is as pictured but the pattern does not align at seams.Color is more pper than it should be and looks YELLOW gold in most light.Positive note: the lor was pretty.The lor is not as vibrant as the photo and it was bigger and more matronly" than I expected.The lors are vibrant and the shirt is pretty.Pros: Colors are brilliant, fun, and as pictured.I didn't really like the neon lors.The lors of this towel are great.Color and pattern.The picture looked like a beautiful smoky teal blue but they were ELECTRIC COBALT blue.The lor is beautiful.This is a very beautiful rung but it is plated and will turn your figure greenThe bathing suit itself was very cute and I had no problems at all with the style, lors, material, etc.I was hoping I'd be lucky but nope, the tie and handkerchief are mpletely different than in the photo, and the shirt is a much brighter blue too.It's to bucks depending on the lors you choose) for four camis.I would have been ok with it if it had been this design in blue).Instead, the umbrella I got is black with a dark blue paisley design.I asked the mpany about that and the yote lor is tan at best much lighter than the picture.It's less of a vibrant pink and it's chiffon instead.This bathing suit stole my heart with its vibrant lors and graphics.The lor is a different lavender than pictured.I ordered this to wear at my gender reveal party because it appears pink and blue.I liked what it looked like until everyone got a show.It is more of a peack blue.The lor was nice.Maybe a darker lor would have worked better but this didn't work for me \Purchased this top in twodifferent lors but the same size.The black one is wearing beautifully It is a dark mustard yellow or even greenish yellow lor.Price was great but it does NOT match white gold in lor.Beware, the lor is fluorescentWish I had spent a uple more dollars and got a more subtle lor.Will not order from this brand againI ordered the green shirt and returned due to the lor that was delivered was a glow in the dark lime green.The lor, which I was hoping was a dusty rose was more of a, well, dirt brown.lors are not as expectedLastly, the pattern is really lovely and fun.I really like the purple and black ones, but I was most excited for the pink set.The lor and flower fringe are pretty tho.The problem was the white.It was really white and they lors were very bright.The lors aren't half as vibrant as shown in the photo.I had placed two separate orders and received different lors and they were pretty.Color is orange not redThe lor of the dress was rrect based on the picture.The lor of the satin was a more yellow gold as opposed to a brown/champagne gold but it was still very nice.I did not receive the dress as desired in the image.The size and lor I needed was being restocked at the time I placed the order and wouldn't have shipped until next week, just two days before the wedding that I will be attending as bridesmaid.The pattern is pretty, but the lors were not as dark/rich as in the photos.Also the lor is off putting.I ordered this for my daughter because I LOVED the plaid bear on the front.The lor was off should have been dark blue not indigo blue.Colors also do not match the print on the sleeves.The picture shows a row of pink crystals surrounding the center stone, with clear crystals surrounding the pink.The flowers in the center were yellow and not white like on the picture.The lors are not true to the mputer image.The black and the white pair, no clear set.So the pack became a pack of white only.The lor online looked very rich and warm, but when I received it, it was just a regular ole brown.Also, the lor is more minty green than a Kelly green.The ONLY reason it got stars is because of the super cute print.Pearls were silvery grey, not white.I was looking for a brighter green.First, the lor is not blush as was advertised - it is a brighter pink lor.I didn't read very well, and it isn't clearly marked, that the shirt is BLACK/red/white, rather than BLUE/red/white.They weren't a true white, more off white.I was gonna buy it because of its lor but in the reality it's not as vibrant blue at all as on the picture (I loved the lors and stripes; also the v-neck.Not only are the lors not as bright as they look on here.Is more white, not as lorful as depicted.The lor also was not a true purpleBut is not white it is cream lorColor was nice but it fit me funny so I returned it.The lenses on these sunglasses are not blueThe first thing I have a problem with is the lor.It looks like a pretty, light blue lor in the picture, but in reality it is more like the bright turquoise.I noticed at my school that some of the health care students had uniforms the exact same lor.The sweatshirt is really cute, it's a nice lor too.Maybe the black one looks better.I love the different lors and how small they are.It is black not blue.Didn't need another black shirt, needed for a blue skirt.The other was multi-lored with a raised surface.The lor, style, and price were great.I did receive unique lors thoughBought this in the shade Naked" which I expected to be a nude/blush lor as shown on the screen.The actual scarf itself was a khaki/beige/light camel lor.I also ordered this in red, but the dress was definitely orange.Look better in the pictureThe dress is pretty and the lors are great, but it is too shortThe glow on the inside is like it's been painted.The are neon orange with bright pink lining.It's a shame because I really like the pink and grey lors of the that I bought.Colors extremely vibrant.Beautiful lorsI bought the purple and pink owl bracelets for my daughter and her teacher.Color is ol, fit is off.Perfect fit and the grey heather pattern wasnice, but it was too sheerNice dress and lors.I was happy with most of the lor mbos until I noticed a bunch of them have pot leafs on them.....so I had to throw a number of them...White on the inside of this lorful swimsuit.*update just reviewed order and nfirmed I ordered beige lor but after looking at lor options realized I received camel lor not beige.The lor was odd I wish it weren't so bright, it has sort of an orange-y hue to it.I was hoping it would be a more neutral lor, but it's still a nice hat.I wanted a more neutral lor, something I uld wear with anything and this wasn't what is hoped.Loved the lor, but it was so small.Color was not represented well in the picture.More of a poppy lor NOT chili redIt's more of a pumpkin orange.I love the lor and material.No basic lors included in my package.If you are looking for something with basic lors and different lors would not remmend it.After ordering a pair in a different lor that was great, I ordered this pair.Color off more pink than orengeItem is good and fit perfectly the only big problem with it is that the lor description said burgundy but is mpletely red not burgundy at all, so please make shure when you order that you look at the review.IT is a good lor and light weight, but I uldn't use it.After ready reviews I chose this pink one in a medium.The lor was too pink like a little girls bathing suit.Maybe a size up will be better if it wasn't for the short torso and pink lor.I gave it two stars instead of one because I like the lors in the shirt.I never have jewelry change lor on me, so I don't know what is going on with this.The lor is mpletely off its a light blue.The yellow on the sleeve wasn't quite as appealing in person.Please click through the pictures.Bummer too ol lors and ol design.I would have preferred a much deeper red.In the picture on Amazon she's dark black.It is teal and not green as advertised.I was able to get a group picture with them on.It is definitely different from the picture.The dress I received was more of a champagne lor and small gold glitter.But I think the dress uld be worn beautifully in the darker lors and the brighter lors options flaws will be less noticeable and the fabric would look better in those types of lors).First, I'd like to say that the green is a beautiful deep shade of teal.It's a beautiful lor that would take you through all seasons.Perhaps it looks better in one of the other lor options.I purchased the white and it cannot be worn without a tank top.I was going to use it for my daughters first birthday to match the pink and gold theme.However, we will not be able to use it since it is not pink, it is more of a peach lor.I did receice one dozen but in repeated lors, dark blue, red, black, green.I didn't receive yellow, orange, violet, brown.The lor is also a little lighter in red, not as rich as on the photo.I ordered the white and blue outfit.The lor was much lighter that shown in the picture, and was more of a peach lor than orange as described.The rings turned lor in one wearing,so now i have pper rings instead of gold.And the lor is off.however I did not really like it cuse In the pic it looks very nice and the lors are perfect but on hand its not really the same.The surface is nice and good lor I just hope they can make it biggerDefinitely pinkIt pretty lors, but when you really look at it It reminds me of a purse liner.It's not padded or the same lor.Not blue/turquoise at all.- the lor isn't vivid like in the photo.The stone lor is more of an gold than a gray hue.Well its shorter then stated not in the lor I ordered so its in a zip lock will be given as a giftThe lor is a brighter than what is shown in the picture.Nice fabric and lor.even though I was given a different lor its still nice and I still like it.The blue top pictured for sale looks turquoise/bright blue- in reality the top is a pastel/powder blue.too big and not the exact lor as pictureThis is see-through and not too flattering- but perhaps that's due to the lor.I ordered this top in the light green.I wanted to love it, the lors were exactly like the picture, but it was too HUGE.Not as nice as the more expensive brand and it's quite light lored.the black and white onesThe lor is more of a peach lor instead of pink.Completely see through and the picture is not the same as I received looks black and is navy blue the bodice is not solid black it is bright orange.(FYI...this refers to the black/white check patterned sweatshirt...not the hoodies, which got great reviews.)As for the lor, it is spot on(Reasoning for the stars given) The lors and pattern are vibrant and gorgeous, and the top fits as expected.They are not red, but actually ral pink.Color is more cyan than blue.The lor was way off from whats displayed The bottom fit perfect,but I wouldn't suggest buying if u don't have big fake perfect boobsThe print is very off centered but I ordered it just in time for the Superbowl so, I wore it anyway.Blue charm" is a lot lighter in personThe lors were mpletely off from the photo.(I ordered the soft green.What came was turquoise.)Love the print, love the feel, love the style.The lor is more of an antique rose, not the ffee lor I expected.Received a lot of the same lors and same patterns I would Not buy again.The style is great, and the lor is awesome, but my wife and I didn't really like the material this dress is made of.This ring has turned lor and does not meet my expected look.i ordered wood grain with brown lenses and i got black on black.:-( The gold in the background does not look good.Comes in a medium brown, so if you are buying to match a purse which is what I was doing) that is the lor shown in the pictures do not do so.Totally different lors.I needed navy lor for my son's school.The lors are bright and vibrant.The picture of the logos and the lors aren't accurate to what you'll actually get.The lor is more rose gold...disappointed that was not part of the description.The lor I ordered was nothing like the lor I received.I would give more stars if the lor was accurate.I ordered the aquamarine, and it was blue.The lors are so pretty, it's why I bought it.Was much lighter in lor that I though it would be.I ordered the ral lor and read the other reviews about the lor saying its a reddish orange lor which is ok with me, but when I received it its BRIGHT ORANGE.The size is exactly what is described, however, the lor is not at all tan/beige.It is a very powder pink lor.The lor is also more of a Pepto Bismol pink than a blush.As a dress, this would get stars.I returned this item as the lor is not at all what I ordered.I thought I was getting salmon pink but I got more of violet.I paid . for the black/camo lored pair.This lor is the only one priced so high.I don't feel like any board shorts are worth , but I sucked it up and bought them anyway because it's the lor I really wanted.Color not clear in picture.I didn't pay close enough attention and this is yellow, not silver.You would think the lenses would have a warm tint if anything based on their lor.Wanted neon green.I would purchase these in other lors as wellThe only lor I would buy is black though.I bought a bunch of these in different lors for my kids teachers for Christmas.So I use the black one I bought and I love it.Its much lighter than the picture almost pastel lors.It's not as bright as the picture shows.i love the bag but the lor isn't silver at all...its gold...if you want gold its perfectDoes not look as good in person as in the picture, In the picture looks royal blue, but in person looks the same lor as blue jeans.Love the lors style.Bought in different lors.I thought that the lors were more grey but it's a heather blue.It's a very dark bluish green.didn't receive what is shown in the photo.I just uldn't live with that look... returnedLovely but turned green the send time I wore it.The necklace I got solid blue in the middle that didn't glow.This blouse has no shape to it, the blouse I received was not white, but a cream lor.However, the blue is not as vivid as the image but gorgeous just the same.The embroidery is pretty but it's blue.sweater was soft and the lors were nice.Hat was bright red, tie was dark red.Nice lor but very boxy.Color almost exactly as pictured didn't think they would be that uglyPretty lorThe good: The print on the wallet was exactly as pictured, clear and vibrant.I was hoping it would be more ral, but it is definitely pink.Love the lor.These sandals are not white.They are more of a yellow-cream.I got the wrong lor, I ordered Silver lor but received light purple lor.....I'm sending it back, even though the purse looks great, it will not serve the purpose of buying it.I cannot pair purple lor purse with silver lor shoe....cant wait to get my money back.Colors look different in person- they remind me of Chicago bears lors.The pink is more peachy.Some of displayed lors not here.It doesn't glow in the dark.Pack did arrive on time but didn't get the light pink one that is shown in the pictureYou can see every unflattering blemish... the lor is great, but that's the only redeeming feature here.I might have enjoyed it, but it came marked several times with some kind of black.Not sure I like the lor.It's not a true Navy.So the black dress not sure about the other lors just the black one) has NO liner it's more of a ver up than a dress."I ordered the pink dress.... the dress I received is red.Very red.Picture doesn't reflect what I received.The first I noticed was that the lor is not crisp white like in picture).it is more an off white or bone lored.lor is not as described.It is a tan or beige.So I decided to buy another in the cream lor.Orange TOO loudSuper cute great lors but too small.lor was not what i expected.too pale in lor of what was expected.I mean the flower is a neon pinkThe teal lor is really pretty and the material is really nice and soft though, so I'm keeping it for layering.lor was not as it appeared online and was not very flattering to wear.The lor is nice, but that is about all I like about it.I loved the print of the top, it was beautiful.The earrings were not as lorful as shown.The lights on this case are yellow, not white The bag itself is quite nice but I wanted total white.Bright pink and runs largeThe ones I received were all blue.It was bright red while the rest of the dress was burgundy.I ordered three dresses the black, the pink, and the one with the swallows.Simple dress, just what I was looking for in a neutral lor that looked great with my brunette hair lor.I ordered this in both black and beige.Colors are very pretty.Ordered in dark brown and burgundy more purple).Fun lours.two stars because I love the pattern and lors.Her derations were all pink and gold and she wore a fluffy pink pettiskirt with a custom white pink and gold shirt.Color was not as described.i ordered gold... Clearly states gold on the order.i received silverI ordered the pink.But stay away from the pinkThe lors on the one I received are just gross: a very bright orange, lots of brown.But I did receive the rrect pattern.The pin stripes are very classy.My guess is that this picture is a knockoff.The lors on the ring are off and are not at all the way they are shown in the picture.The Rose gold is not rose gold at all.Does not match any of the rose gold I already have.The lor is great and it is really warmWe received black suspenders and yellow bow tie.It is silver not that dark gray.Color is very pretty, material is nice.Unfortunately, the shirt that we received is not navy red but instead black hot pink.the lor was the only positive point.Looks pretty, but with the regular use, loose the lorThe dress is beautiful and fits well; however, I ordered it for a wedding that I am in and the lor pictured is mpletely different than that of the dress.Pretty bracelet but in time I know it will turn meaning the silver plated lorThe printed so was cute, and I liked it.turned my neck greenSuper cute lor.I was looking for a bright orange blue and this is the only pair I found.And don't expect the pretty bright lors you see.Doesn't match the painting.it's not the pink in the picture, it's bright, hot, neon pinkI don't like the material and the lor.This inside is a cheesy red vinyl, not an attractive lor, instead of D B's signature red fabric.Good lors and quality but too very very small.Pretty/vibrant lors.The lor is a great baby powder blue BUT it's not set and curly like the picture.Gorgeous lour and nice shape but go down two sizes.The lor was nice and we're of nice quality for the price.Color and fabric is nice.However I am going to keep them, I was able to rrect the loring using a red permanent marker and now they are a nice vibrant red and I like them.But I shouldn't have to use a Sharpie to lor them rrectly.You've been warned, only order the red if you are okay with pink pearls or if you have a red Sharpie on hand.Color was blue and white.These rings turned my toes green.The only thing that I liked it is the lor.This skirt doesn't flare out like the picture and is definitely more of a yellow gold than the soft greenish pictured here.It's is true to this photo.It is more grey than anything else.Received different necklace, but it was cute so I kept it.Beads are red and not the lor shownLastly lor was not as pictured.It is more of a taupe/gray lor.Beautiful lors and pattern, but it runs very small.Great lors, but they develop holes after only a uple of wears.Color was darker and design was different.The lors did not look as crisp as I thought they would.That did not show in the photo, so I have given it to my sister.The lors are not what the picture representslooks more gold than yellow.This was very cute for about a month, then the gold lor started to rub off and it turned my finger greenThe Blue lor shown is not the lor I received.It is more the sapphire royal blue lor that they advertise.The picture reflects more of an aqua blue.The lor is glow in the dark ral.pretty lors, but they fall out very easy the backs are very loose.The chain lor does not match the charm.The lors pictured did not match the lor I received, the lor scheme was the same but the lors were darker, not a mplete deal breaker.she loves them and loves the polarized.I Liked the lor and design.This dress was not as shown.Color is a very bright lor, the ral is a neon lor for sure.super adorable more of a rose gold lor and there is a little bell on it.Not white.I bought other lors and they did not do this.Nice lor and overall shape, but I would call it a medium.Love the lor and would be cute if you didn't look like a blow up deration.I ordered it because it was described as dark red.I'm returning it because it's bright red.And the gown I received.The peach lor is more like a swimsuit than a formal dress.I loved these rings but stopped wearing them because of the lor.The lors are beautiful.Colors are EXACTLY as pictured and very vibrant.It's a pretty lor just not the fit u would expect.I purchased the bright yellow one for a Halloween Costume and it worked fine for that but I threw it away afterwards.See photo I've added- it's gorgeousVery large.. pretty lorAside from that, the lor is prettyThe lor is off and the style isn't as described.If it was a longer and had a tank in the same lor I would love it.Plus it was more orange than pink.Color didn't match other Maevn uniforms that I already have.Color totally different.Would have given stars if only they had the rrect picture.Good lor thoughThe lor is exactly as described.Cute for the money, sturdy enough, just too yellow.Pity, because the lor was amazing.Lastly the lor is Hot PinkThe red lor was pretty however, and if you can find a size that feels ok on you, the style of the dress is flattering to hide any tummy insecurities.They was so rose gold.While I loved the lor, I wish I had purchased a size larger.The picture shows the lors are orange and turquoise throughout.But the small dot beads are instead pink and red.And there three different lors of blue/green.These earrings are dark greenI ordered this because I loved the mbination of lors, however, the rhinestones on this necklace is very large and gaudy.The pink is more on the peachy side then pink.Great lor and style.The silver gray runs small ( I have black, navy blue, royal blue and they all fit fine.I was warned, as I read the reviews, that this purse was a lighter gray than shown, but, WOW, this was not just a variation in the lor, in person it's almost white.It was not this lor, it was more of a cholate brown.I liked the lor and fabric, so wished they'd fit better.Also the lors are not as bright as shown on the mputerThe patterns do not match up.Colors are way off.Color is not as depicted, its a pale pink.Color not the same as advertised.the beads are pink.It fits fine but the shirt was not dyed equally so there are large areas on the shirt that are lighter lor than the rest.The green lor for some reason doesn't fit as well as others I have purchased.Fits ok but it is a faded black lor, not a deep black lor.I thought I ordered a white background but received a light blue and it was to be a scarf but is a large shawl.The lors were not very vibrant either.Color not as shown in pictureThe stitching on my brown one is lighter like the current mahogany lor.they have blue marks from the factory and I didn't like that since it's noticeable.The lor and the print is true to what the image shows.IF however the lor was as shown I would have been a happy nsumer.The actual item is indeed emerald green.BEAUTIFUL BUT TURNING GREENDress did turn body black, but that was an easy fix.I got the light tan ffee lor.The picture doesn't reflect the true image of the dress.Really wish it was all red.Ok. Not all the same lor though.the lor is off I have a large I need a xIt is definitely not red.Because of the mix up or difference in lor, I'm giving it a two.This lour was not Prime.Not like shown in the picture.I love the lors and they way the bracelet design is set up.Hot pink.Item that arrived was more of a dark reddish mauve and definitely not the bright passion' pink as advertised.I will say, however, that the lor was exactly what I expected and wanted.It changed the original lorIt should not be the mirrored one.I suggest a lighter lor so it won't ntrast so much The lors do not match the image shown.mix and matchIt is a pretty lor.It's ok but the ring change lorsThis is a beautiful at, it's soft, the lor is perfect, I love the bold buttons and it is too smallColor is too bright.The lor I wanted wasn't in stock so I ordered the green which was just OK. Will be returning it.The print was fine but nothing that special.The photo on Amazon was very pretty and the term Ocean Mosaic" seemed representative, as it showed several different lors and sizes of blues and greens, which is what one might expect of a mosaic" approach.To fit under the lor of a shirt.On the good hand the lor was nice.It doesn't look like real gold.Also, the dress shown prior to ordering was an eggplant purple lor.When received, it was more of a plum lor.Seemed like a good buy but looking closer at these glasses out in daylight they are more of a purple.The lor is rrect but it is not A-lineBEAUTIFUL LAVENDER COLOR.You know, Christmas lors are red not orange?But when I received this in the mail it is entirely a jersey type material not denim at all I purchased the black lor).Color good.No hearts and two flags instead.So I bought the same size just different lors.The white lor was blandNever got wet and the gold lor is ming off.The hunt for a Great White shirt) ntinues...I do wonder, however, why it is labeled aprit" as it is a nice beige, as the picture shows.More off-white then white.My grandson lives this jacket because of lor.Love the lorThankfully since it's dark blue you really can't tell.Way too big, nice quality and lor, easy to return:)They are not a nice yellow gold.This turned me green after two short wears Under six hours each).There not dark at allThe lor is more red than burgundy.Nice vibrant lors.I bought lors, black, red, and brown.The material on top is rather sheer and the skirt instead of being navy is more of a royal blue.The lors are nice though.Change lors within weeksOrdered it in white and I loved itLove the lors but was very sad that it was too tight on the torso.Color is BEAUTIFULWe ordered this dress in plum for my sister-in-law's wedding.Not the lor I wanted, yet not too far off.Liked lors and design but that was it. stars for the lors...pretty lors cut was too narrow in armsIt has plenty of room and it is a neutral lor.I liked the lor, and the fabric, but was just much too large for me.But IT DOES turn you greenI have other rings I wear all day every day and they're sterling silver and DON'T turn me greenIt is not worth it, as my finger is turning green whenever I wear it.The yellow on this is neon yellow...The batwing is not as pronounced as it is in the photo.More of a tomato lor than a deep red like it looks.)NOTHING> It is shiny black, not long at all.Loved the lor.Color is very bright and not what I expected or what the picture shows.In this picture it is definitely pink.Not so in fact....it's orange.It's very much turquoise.This belt is NOT white.It's off white/cream.The metal on this changed lors very quickly.The gold is not very nice and the blue back ground is glitterThe pattern described was not at all like on the photo.The lor description on this blouse was orange.When the blouse arrived it was close to a pper lor but very pretty.It looks like a nice rich brown and taupe, but in reality it has major yellow undertones.Almost a light purplish greyThe lor is nice ..The lor didn't match the lor it showed on the picture... it shows like a sea green, but really it was a bright neon greenThe lor silver was deceiving as they were actually gray.Bright bright gold, not what I expected.The shoes were very cute out of the box, bright lored and sparkly.Only reason they get stars instead of .Nice dark green though.Keeping them because they are a nice lor option in navyIt is not rose gold..it is yellow gold.The white part had red stains and the red part had navy blue stains.The lor was not right either, it was suppose to be blue and it was turquoise instead.The print quality is fine--the lors are clear and bright enough.The lor I ordered purple) is bright and cheerful, and the material is thick and stretchy.Sunglasses are all Grey... Not black and silver.The lor isn't exactly like the picture and it was wide on me and I ordered a small.The shirt is great except for the lor.When the description, pic, and name say ORANGE, I shouldn't expect a light ral almost salmon lor to show up.I only got / lors, the rest were duplicates.Turned my belly button green did not enjoy that but is still cuteLove the style, but changed lor after I wore it few timesBut I did like style and softness and lorI ordered the which is definitely blue in the picture and these are not blue.The lors are not as bright as pictured.I love the lors but when I open it one stone had fallen off.I have purchased several other pairs in other lors from Amazon but and was very happy but these were a let down.More of a solid black lor.I got the black and white stripes.Love the lor thoughThe lor wasn't quite as expected.Color was very pretty.Would definitely remmend, and I can see myself buying one in a different lor eventually.Color of the pink is more salmon, depending on lighting, outdoors it's salmon, indoors it's a lot like in the photo.The plaid accents are more of a royal blue than the dark blue depicted in the photo.Brick red lor is actually two tones of bright orange.Not what I expected, nothing like the pic or descriptionThis one and my white one are defected.Colors were not as depicted in the photo and shipping took forever seeing how they came from China.Very flattering and the lors were nice.I do like the lors.Colorof the dress is more peach than pink.the knife handles are pink...Lovely lours but these fit small and do not wash and wear wellI liked the lor and the fur fringe.This sweater is NOT white.I love the lor but they are to smallThe lor ..The print was fuzzy and not as bold or bright as pictured, and only on one side so not worth the price.The buttons were gold, very gold.I love the feathers and the lors.Bright saturated yellow with glaring purple flowers.. not a nice pale yellow like the photo.But, the banana-yellow of the zipper did not match the mustard yellow of the purse.Maybe another lor would be a better choice.Image was red, dress was blue.The lor is not as it appears online.The dress itself is fine, but the lors bled into the white during shipping I guess?Not gold toned at all.You have to tie yourself; / are Christmas printring is tinted black not silverIt is versatile though but just be cautioned that the lor may not be the same.The lor is gorgeous They are very dark purple/blackish.What's weird is I ordered the black and it was like a medium and I ordered the blue and it fit well.Good product but arrived in a full black version instead of a red/black mix.Without the lor problem, it will be a - rate.I received blacks dark grey, light grey and burgundy lor.The vest and tie are white, not cream and the tie is not the same white.See the picture of the shirt next to a Blue)Hilfiger polo and a BLUE) Cubs New Era Snapback.Instead of being mint green it's beige, and the butterflies are more vibrant blues and purples than what is shown.Most of my disappointment mes from the fact that I already own a dress in the same beige lor, made of the same material, with the same butterfly pattern.Nice lor also.Not exactly like the picture appears.I ordered the pink one pictured as a bright pastel but what I received was more of a mauve or dusty pink--much darker than what I'd expected and not in my lor wheel.I wish it came in more lors TBH.Its as if the lors were inverted.The dress is more white than black and the design is way off.It is not bright yellow, but more a pastel yellow.Love the lors, but I have a long torso.The blue is exactly as shownThe pattern was much brighter than the picture.The gold loring wore off immediately.I didn't like the material, and the lor is more brick red than wine.The at actually arrived as a Cholate Brown.It's not whiteIt's more of a ivory lor then white.First, the top of this shirt is not white as picture, it is a cream lor.They definetly were not the camo- lored sunglasses I purchased as seen in the picture Ordered the orange with pink bottoms.The darker lors washed nicely.Well lor me surprised, this ring is in fact gold plated.Bottoms are cute thought it was seen upside down the top) I love the buttons though.I did not love the red in it.I wanted more pink.The tan is very orange.The material, lors and style are all very pretty.Color was not what I thought it would be.I thought it would be more of a maroon lor.Like the lors though.It's a cute dress and lor, but it didn't work for me.The lor and design is pretty tho.The lor is more of a baby blue than it is Jean blue.I bought the black and it is necessary to wear a slip underneath.The shirt is nice but it is not white.Also the lors are way off in the picture--you get vibrant, bold lors instead of a dainty, untry floral lors/patters.A very pretty maxi dress with a great black and white pattern.I love the lor of this dress.The lor was a little lighter than I expected.The lor was exceptional, however.The lor was nice though.Not the lor showndid not get the same top in the picture.i thought there would be a lorful layer and then the black overlay.They are just a very vibrant green which is what I wanted.The lor is pretty...Cute but the lors starting ming off in weeks.Color is not the white expected.It's off white.I would like to return it because it doesn't look good on me at all.BROWN IS NOT BROWNIf you're looking for a burgundy/brown this is what you want.I did not receive all three lors, I got one blue, and two white/clear .I wasn't happy with my purchase, mostly because I did not receive the third ring in black.Overall cute.The lors are reat but its not strong.This sweater is very small but nice lorI like the mint green in the picture, but I got a white one which is alright because I like itThe lor is off, and it's not really like it looks.Love the print of the dress The lor was way off I thought I was getting a red Turned out to be neon pink Very nice pattern.First of all, I ordered two different lors and I received the same lor.The undies in the pic.I ordered the grey/pink version of this sweat shirt and loved it, so I decided to order the back/white one too.it shows that this product is true red but it more like orange.The lor looks more of a burgundy lor.When I got them, the lor is bright red.Color different from what I expected.The one great thing about this shirt is that the lor was true to the picture, and it is a pretty top, but just not on me.The pattern on the seams on the sides don't match up and the skirt is a funky print.Ok but not like picture.In the picture it was the same lor, when I received it.It was two different lors.The lor is very bright n pretty.lor of the embroidery was too bright in mparison to the photo.Maybe it looks better in a different lor.the lor is more yellow than nudeColor is neom orange, not light orange like description.The designs are printed on.Bought this dress expecting it to be red but it is closer to a al lor.Also, the shirt I ordered was orange.By the image, I was expecting a black, dark purple peach-ish lor with a slight sketchy quality to the design but this is red, white blue with a very solid, pronounced design.its clearly blue.just.. very blue.The dress is not what is pictured.It's orange and navy.I thought it would be heavier tton and darker lors.Pretty to look at and a nice lor is the only positive that I can say about it.The lor is nice though.It is a muted grey lor.I got a lor called Rose, which is actually a very pale peach lor.I wanted the gray and receive a tan.Not bright at all.Color is great just wish it would actually fit as I did check the sizing chart and measure myself before placing the orderFugly lors.Beautiful lor but sleeves are too short.love the ncept it arrive before time but the gold lor change to a rusted brown lor.Very light in lor and reminds me more of orange.Bought the khaki lor and it showed up closer to a traditional cream lor...I think the image for that option needs to be updated because its not even close to the in-person lor.Love the print.I have FOUR just didn't care for the lor of this one it was more of a mint green than the picture.I was hoping for turquoise.I'm giving this two stars for the following reason; the suit is super cute and I loved the style and lor I bought the black and lime green; true lor to picture).I was expecting a California pendant with the heart over Los Angeles, like in the photo.I only received the silver and the gold.the product is not what i expected, i don't like the lor and i will returned it back and choose and another lor i want to know the process for returns regardsBeautiful lor although it was more pink than ral.I ordered the lorful flower.Very cute shirt, love the lor, purchased the blue.I ordered the aqua lor sweater and it is not as bright as the photo.I order the lor Lace it was exactly as described on amazon.Asides from that it was beautifulBut BEWARE: you may not get the style you ordered.Just ok. Design true to picture.The lor is true to the image I got the light pink).The lors online are very accurate to what you get.** grey sweater with lorful sleeves *I love this print and have it in a top.girl, but nice and lorful.I bought , one red and one white.The red is dark, not unlike blood, not too bright, very pretty.Looks too yellow, but very sturdy and well madeI bought it in black and gray.I liked that a clear leather cream was included for other lors besides black.Not the light pink I ordered, it's more of a light salmon lor.I didn't get all of the lors shown.No light blue, no olive, mostly blacks and grays.love the print and lor but was too small for me.The blue lor is stunning.The lors are great and true to picture I got black on top that changes to purple/pink below the knee and that part looks great)The tie is navy blue and so on.Its cute and the shade of lor is amazingThese are not shoesVery pretty ring.Really love it, bout have only had about months and the handles have Chips" in the lorCool w a black ring.The pattern is far more apparent in real life than I expected.Like the lor.I didn't notice that the rim of the jewels are a gold lor.I don't like the gold lor at all.The navy blue side was pretty great and had all its fasteners, but the stitches were still a little off.Not quite as shown on picture.The one I received is gold in tone, the center is greenish not aqua, and the birds and leaves are tiny and not lorful.Beautiful shadesNot nearly as lorful as pictured but they are cuteThey are definitely polarized too.Great lor, nice fit, good quality, but not a dress.I thought maybe that was just a photo issue but it really mes as a neon orange lor.I ordered one blue necklace, and one purple necklace and I received purpleI got purple and find that it attracts lint and or pet hair like a magnet.The pink or blush lor is subtle with the white thread.pants are a mpletely different lor instead of a muted bluish green as depicted, they are a bright aqua.More of a grey lor than white and slightly small but a great look and styleOrdered the grey one charal) and it fit fine in a medium.My only issue is the lor.I was expecting the lor to be more muted as shown in the photo.I know that lors can be off a bit, but this was beyond off.Not as brightly lored as the photo in my opinion.It's a beautiful vest, however, it is NOT the same Brown as pictured.It's a metallic type lor.Purchase if you're okay with something lighter than pictured, don't purchase if you're needing it a deep brown.However, it would have been cute and given stars if it fit.Colors are not as vivid as depicted.I bought it in pink.Blue is bright not light.I was looking for a yellow necklaces that would mpliment my black and white striped dress.The yellow is more of a slight neon/bright yellow.The aprit is not such a blush lor that my mputer monitor shows.It is the lor of a pastel brown paper bag lor.Love the lor and the materialI love the lors of these onesies..I liked the detail and lor was nicer than depicted.The lor and pattern are flattering.The actual lor was dark red dark green.Pictures are accurate.This is already turning lors.The three stars are more for the design than for anything else.The graphics are great and I love the vibrant lorsLove the grey/blue together but it's very heavy feeling bc of the length.The lor is creme not white.The mint isn't mint at all, it's baby blue.great lorThe pattern is very cute, and the lors are accurately portrayed online.Pretty lor.... but Sent it backI love the lors and it fits great, just that they irritate my ear for some reason.The lor is a little lighter blue than in the picture.Nice material and true to lor.it is also see through so you have to watch what lor underwear you have on under.It's ok, but doesn't look the same on as picture showsI ordered two of these, one in black and one in white.These sandals are very nice and I love the lor.Love the lorNote: The picture on the left is the bathing is the bathing suit I received, The picture on the right is my creationI love the lor and it looks great but again I haven't put any mileage on it never worn, or cleaned.)The purple one is nowhere near as the nice as the pink one.I was expecting a more lightish blue lor, and I received a mint/institutional green lor.I ordered navy blue and it's definitely black.The lors are spot on as well.I returned the grey one and got the white one instead.The lor seems off but they are beautiful, just beware that they are a double flare and may be hard to insert into ears.The lor is more of a rusty red, not red wine as described.I bought the aqua one, and the lor is nice...but the material wasn't what I expected.I would order the black for a less revealing look.The red is definitely darker than the picture they show, more like a burgundy.I bought black.Pretty print and great material.Awkward to put on but great lor.Fabric and lors are what I expected.I ordered a different lor but same size as a friend ordered from the same vendor and mine was huge so I had to return the product.The blue ver-up came as pictured it's pretty fits well, no mplaintsHave one in cream lor which fits better.Colors are fun but....It has a nice shape and is adjustable but the lors are off and not like the photo at all.Its so hard to find dinosaur stuff in girly lors.Beautiful lor.Nice ColorsColor is not the actual US blue.My shoes were reddish maroon rdovan and the same lor as off-the shelf wax rdovan polish.Would have liked different lors and or designs.Chose Beige but order got changed to peach because beige was out.The lor was also lighter than on the website.Colors are vibrantHappy with the lors, very true to picture.I ordered the orange pair, hoping it was close to the shade it showed online.When they arrived, they were closer to a ral lor.The dress is a lighter blue than the picture and isn't exactly the same quality as the picture.I thought that the jeans were more of a bright pink not Coral.Overall cute stume, but be aware that it's not as dark as it should be.Like it not the lor I expected and a bit big in the sleeves but over all a nice dressAlso, I ordered the aqua and received white.Color is not as bright and vivid as pictured.beautiful lor/pattern but not for everyone...My daughter, however, loved the look of the shoe because she didn't need to choose between her two favorite lors.Its an alright jacket for the price, however the lors don't exactly match the picture, its about four to six shades darker then expected.First, I ordered set Dashing, because I thought the lors were: pink, red, gold, blue/grey, green.When I received them they were actually: light pink, dark pink, lavender, green.Those lors didn't work for us, so I sent them back.Then I ordered set Stylish because I thought the lors of the last ties pictured were red and black.They will work better than the first set, but I wish the lors were more accurate.Overall, I like the product.The style was cute and lors were vivid.This is not blue" its teal".:/ Color goes pretty much all the way through sure, inside" is lighter than the outside but when you open them, the light around you bleeds through.Also, the lor was a little different from what is seen on the website.lors very pretty though.The length is good and the lor of the blue stripe is good.Straight on it is a nice cranberry lor, like in the photo, but from other angles it looks much lighter.Once again, we didn't receive the rrect lor.We like the glasses, but sure wish we uld purchase all plain brown.Color was lighter than expected.Does not look real at allLove the lor, not so fond of the shape of the necklineColor is more an off white than white but i loved the skirt.Adorable fabric and the lor pictured is exactly the lor you get.it is FIRE ENGINE RED, like super red.Color is great though.The lors are off...too lavender and a bit pink...not flesh toned.not quite as vivid as it is shown, however...I believe the image has had the ntrast manipulated so that the design appears more bold than it does in actuality.arms are bright purple/pink, not the burgundy I was expectingOnly reason I'm not giving five stars is that I ordered them in black.They're not black... they're dark gray.But not the lor I paid for.i liked the lor online, but its more red than burgundy.Having it darker than expected is a bit of a letdown but I do still like the lor).These are good in some ways: nice zipper pulls and bright lor.It's very bright hot pink..The lor, sizing and length is great but it is so see-throughI planned on buying all four lors in all different sizes because i thought they were so cute but I probably won't by another one.I got the pink blazer.The cream lor is see-through; I had to return it.Other, darker lors are fine.This review is for the cream lor; I would give a higher star level to other lors.Great product/print and lor.It's a brighter pink than expected.The red is a bit more orange than I liked though.The swimsuit is different lors; red and navy blue on the front and the teal and royal blue on the back.Although the lors are odd, he ended up keeping it because the fit was great.The suit is a beautiful lor and great material.I was very happy with the lor and it looked very pretty.Waitband is aggravating and Inseam is short but beautiful lors and if you just going for show they are greatThe lor is not so vibrant as i tought.They were advertised as pink.Actually are red.Online it shows the lors being more bright and vivid.Just wish I had chosen a different lor.This ring is not black, not like a black tungsten ring.It's dark grey.I wanted to love this bra it's pretty I love purple.Very cute pattern.Color was much lighter than shown and did not go well with my skin tone.It just didn't look or feel right, so I had to return it.The lor was not what I expected.I wished it had actually been turquoise and NOT blue.Very vibrant blue.it also wasn't pink it was magenta.The jeans wasn't as dark as the picLike the shirts overall.I really like the top I would buy more if the top came in more then one lor.it is not yellow; it is more orange.would not have bought it had I known it was orange.Nice lors as indicated in pic.I did not get the lor that I had ordered.The lor is - shades lighter than portrayed on the web-site.Has denim stitching style and lor as expected.Disappointing since i liked the style lor.Love the lorsPretty shirt, lor and style are great, but there are a few issues.And the lors were much brighter.The lor is pretty and pattern unique which is why I kept it anyway.It's a nice size and I got it in pink and I love the lorI bought three lors and they are two different brands.I wish I knew which lors were La Clef.Color shown in photo is accurate.Skirt is burgundy black.The purple lor is more like a light or soft lavender.Not super bright as depictedBut cute overall.But overall my son loves itGood buy however i bought it to match a sneaker to wear for my birthday Aug th but the lor was not true to lor.But cute overallColor was not white more of an ivory.Color was not rrect.Thought it was a very light pink.When I recieved this the item lor and item was exact to what was shown online but had a unique odor.I also ordered ivory and got white which I'm not to happy about it but like I said it will Color was matching the picture.loved the lor... but it was kinda big...I think it would have worked out better if I had ordered a light-lored shirt and chosen a darker ink.It was a good neutral lor though.The shirt has great lors, it has a teal lor that goes with my teal leggings a mint lor that goes with my mint CAMI and red to go with my red leggings...So if you see the blue shirt with sequins I remmend not getting it, because if you do you'll regretIt wasn't the purple I was expecting mine was more of an maroon but I'm okay with that.The lor of the dress was not the same in the picture.When it arrived it was tan/taupe as described) and the accents were gold, not silver as was reflected in the picture.Just wish that it had been the lor I had thought.The only reason I'm giving a star rating is the lor is way off.Color is COMPLETELY off on the purple dress.This is the fifth M- field at I've owned over my lifetime unting the original that was issued to me.Nice quality and lor was true to photo.per the picture the shoes are a navy lor but they are actually royal blueThis is an orangy-peachy lor.It's a pretty ring but the ruby is not ruby like lor when it's in lightI own it in brown and it is amazing.Send, the lor isn't true to the image.I was expecting a green-blue mint.Instead I feel I revived a more blue than green lor.Great print.The lor is gorgeous.Love them but after wearing then a few days white shows through the black.Love the skirt lors, looks great on Model, just not with any top I own or can find.I wish it came in different lors and not look so wrinkled all the time, But the picture was good.The lors are beautiful, exactly the shades we wanted.Otherwise, the lor is great, the neckline is great, but I can't really wear it.I have one in white as well.Got orange and white.May just keep them and order a black pair and hope I get that lor as the they are really cute.I like it but it is not as bright and beautiful as the picture shows.Would be stars if lors were more vibrant/ clear.Its also more of a warm tan lor than shown in pictures.When the light shines through them, they are that clear, brilliant blue you see in the listing.The lor is true and rich, and the silk feels wonderful.Color is very vibrant.The lor red) was brighter than the picture depicted, but was close enough for my taste.I ordered an was expecting a light/powder blue lor for a family event.The lor in this photo is not rrect.I ordered this in both deep blue and pink.I got the blue in medium, the pink in large.I loved the print turquoise blue roses, beige background).The darker lors are probably a safer bet.I wanted the nice mellow yellow lored sunflower but instead I got a really bright orange sun flower shirt The lors are vibrant.Still a good wig, the pink is a lot brighter than pictured and the blonde isn't as long.Color is much brighter than pictured, almost neon yellow.They look exactly as they appear online.The red lor on the pics is actually brown .Beautiful gold lor.Its more of a cream lor with a blue tint to it.I ordered , in different lors, but now I wish I had gotten one just to see.Great lor.The lors on the pant vs the striping on the shirt are off.Dress is amazing only thing it's Rose gold and not goldLight lor tan) makes the material and fit issue more prominent.This is a glorified belt.I bought the teal-lored bag, and the lor was way brighter than what was shown in the picture.Also would be nice if they came with more lor choices than white, gray, and blue.The lor is qorgeousIt sounds like darker lors may work better.Burgundy NOT Red as statedThe only real thing about it, is a like the lor.Colour was not as bright as expected.Love heart except for the paint on insideOrdered the blue medium, not the same lor as advertised.I thought the lor was accurately portrayed as it was in the picture.I now own all the lors of this skirt.I ordered the purple paisley, mixed pattern, lor NCPRX.Here are the pictures.The ones I received are gold lored with a red logo.No blue, no yellow.I expected the lor to be a bit heathered/worn, but it's much more vibrant.It's more of a pewter lor.Would do well with a grey pencil skirt;)Looked good but the gray was white for some reason.A little big for my little one and not a true pink in lor.i do however love the lor and the scarf makes it look stylishlor has stayed and is beautiful.The only positive was that the light green lor I was needing was located in the paisley pattern as well, so although it was not as expected it would still match the Body Glove swimsuit top I already have.Meets my need for white wears well with white shirtsI ordered the gray, great lor.Colors were too NEON for me.They are mfortable but not nude...more like a pale peach lor; therefore they are more obvious while wearing even the tiniest peep toe.Only stars because some of the black washed onto the white.I think I may order the white tungsten carbide" version and see if that holds up any better.Pictures, for lor mparison.The one with three rings are left to right) k white gold, this ring, k rose gold.The one with four rings are k white gold, k rose gold, this ring, k yellow gold.It is so very interesting because we bought two pair one black and one charal, for some reason the charal was somewhat smaller than the black.The kimono I received has different lors- orange flowers with olive green..More on the bright/neon lorside which makes the design of the suit look a little cheesy.I got the powdered blue one the lor is beautiful and makes me think of Easter Color was darker and different but I still liked it(these photos should be ok since some of the others shown show way more)Brighter pink than pictured, but looks nice.The lor was way too bright, almost orangey I prefer a cherry red.Nice lors, but expect them to be a little bit different than the photo.It is a champagne lor not gray.rose gold lor""" fadeing"""Buyers should note that the lor is a much lighter pink, not the fuchsia pictured.Would be better if you uld pick the lors we got prs of the same lor.The center stone lor is more green than aqua, the side gems are aqua.The lor is not the same as on the photos.Nice style, but the yellow was VERY neon greenish-yellow.The lor is more of blue grey than blue.It was what I expected, but the gold loring is already wearing off of the metal.I like the lors, though.I liked it but was thinking, the print isn't going to be the same as you saw on the website floral on bottom).It doesn't look like the picture, setting of it is right.Beautiful lors.Color's off, and it's definitely not silk.It's very cute just not the lor/animal I wanted.Great lor Nice fabricI bought this in lors, the grey is thicker fabric which I loveIt's a nice lor though.I would of prefer another lor.I ordered the black dress and unlike other reviewers the print is beautiful and vibrant and looks pretty much exactly like the picture.I find the print to be very nice and as expected.Honestly not worth but whatever I love the lor and print.I love the lors and style of these panties.I got it in and it's a mpletely different lor than the one that ordered.Just wish it was the right lor.These were true to size, however he lor of these shoes are much more of a yellow gold.The price is definitely reasonable and the blue lor is very pretty.Loved the printI received pink, red, grey, brown.I love the lor of this scarf.The plaid was a good lor red, but the plaid portion of the top does not stretch at all sleeves and backing) so it is not forgiving when pulling it over your head.These are ALL SILVER.I didn't like the lor on this much.So, I originally bought these because I liked the lor and design.I purchased this to match a skirt with purple in it, but putting the skirt up with this top it does not match.Cute lor, and well made.The lor is great.Vibrant lors.The lor and design were very nice, but had to return it.I guess I will have to wait for a few months, to see if it changes lor occurs.This dress fits well with good lors as shown in the pic.I purchased for BOTH pairs and only received the hearts, which btw I do LOVE THEMI needed it for a red/black stume party and it did the job.The light is very bright...The earnings were pretty and appeared well made, but the pink lor is so light in lor that it really looked white.Color is not what I expected...was at brighter pinkFirst there is fabric on the inside around the lor that shows through the dress.Colors are very nice together.It's not dark blue.It's a medium blue-purple lor.Just happy I wasn't looking specifically for dark blue.The lor is beautiful as expected but the fit is not.I chose the charal lor.I got the orange two piece.However, I'm going to put a short vest with it and wear it because I do love the lor.Just the lor I was looking for.so when you button it up the like patterns don't merge.I thought the lor would be the same as what is in the picture gray).not this lorIt's not a deep pink like I had expected from the picture.but it looks ok. im keeping them because i get a lot of lors for a good price.I will be ordering different lors for my daughter.You can't see this in any of the pictures.The lor and detail of the graphics are spot on.Wear a Cami tank with the white.The heather lor is a nice change to plain brown.Color was not exactly the same as pictured.Color changes slightly I bought the blue-green) but not as in the photos.What happens is that it turns a brighter blue on me but then parts ol down or heat up?)Lighter tan lor than expectedWell...it IS the right size and lor.Fit cute but the lors are off in pictures.To me it looks like pink and light blue mixed in.The pants I got are red white and blue..Very cute overall.Beautiful lorI expected the lor to be much brighter or lighter like the one displayed on here also.If the buttons were black or pewter, I think it would've worked.Maybe it's just the lor I ordered... berry gold buttons not for me.I loved the lor, just wish it would have fit.But just be warned that the picture doesn't give a very accurate portrayal of the lor.the short is really nice, the lors are vibrant just as the picture show.Colors are true to the photo Black part is suede, which was a surprise, but I don't mind it.Description should include lor>(The lors are not as good at the picture portrays.Oh well, had the lor been what what I thought, I would have kept it.a little big I lor its nicenot the right lor as the picktureI was excited to receive this item because I loved the style and the lor.These are ok shorts.My other lors are not see thru at all but these pants are like a mpletely different brand they are that different.The lor wasn't exactly as I expected from the picture, but I do really like the design.This dress is pretty, but NOT true to lor.I ordered ivory and it is bright white.Yes it said blue and that they are solid blue but the picture represents lot nicer looking bags.Color was great... there was no funny smell that other customers had reported.Overall it's a cute dress.Lovely lor, too small and a bit see through just needed a nude body suit underneath.The wallet I received wasn't as vibrant a lor as the one advertised.Besides the disappointing lor, the wallet was a good purchase.better in pictureNice but the lor advertised is darker than the lime green that arrived.Much brighter lor than in the picture, so Im not that thrilled about it.The dress I received is not those.As good as expected, lor was more of a straight orange rather than a peachy lor.I originally purchased it in green and loved it so much I reordered a royal blue one.The lors are nice and bright and images are good and clear.Once again, need to offer more lorsThe lor is also much more green and bright than the pale muted turquoise-blue that's pictured.I like the lors.Cute patternI ordered the Vernon shirt and the design was exactly right acrding to the picture.Good lor and very cute shape.Much nicer fits perfect I'd like more in different lors and patternsI loved the lor and print on the shirt.The beads on the picture my daughter ordered from were red which highlighted the fading to red effect.This print is very pretty and so is the style.Pretty lorsRed was brighter than expected, although it seems to be made well.This dress is a great lor and a good fit.It is a good size and lor.I purchased the wine red in size .These ties arrived and were more of a sky blue than a mint lor.I knew the lor was gray was just expecting more of a silvery tint... Plan on returning due to size...Maybe it would have looked better in a different lor?Still a nice lor and works tip till the knee.The lor and the size are nice.They're cute and I love the lorThe pattern is cute and it really appeals to Middle School Girls..The dress is gorgeous, but we ordered a blush and it came in more of a ral lor so we had to return them.The purple lor is nice as shown.It does glow a greenish lor, as long as you let it charge in the sun or under a bright light for a while.I received a cherry red wallet.....which will be alright I was expecting pink.OK I will start with saying, that this skirt is cute and lor is very vibrant.the gold like fades very easy and fast, The charm would be fully silver soon.Buttons are very white on an off white at.I got the rose gold ones.The suit I ordered one in red and one in light blue to try on) Pros: Both lors of this suit that I purchased are very pretty.These black and gold set) are snugger than I imagined based on the description.Also, the tan/gold one is darker than the picture, and so does not match the scarf I bought it to match.Not sure if it would survive the first wash. Other than that it fits nicely and the lor is bright red as expected.Cute dress but the red lor that I ordered is more of a maroon.It's still very cute, I ordered midnight paisley but they sent midnight blues.Ordered the orange, they fit my yr. old son perfectly.Be warned if you purchase a lorI ordered the gray but received sky blue.I was expecting them to be more vibrant in lor.The send bracelet I received was NOT the same as the first one.This one was darker lored and smelled like a tannery.I also bought the black one.I did think it was a navy lor when I bought it but it turned out to be black, not a problem I just wish I knew when I bought it.Not the same lor at all.The royal blue is almost neon.The shade of blue in the ad is a chambray lor, but the actual lor is more navy.This like the bracelet is not what I call red to mr it's orange, my aunt loved the bracelet ans she will love the bracelet.These board shorts have a great pattern on them and are a very nice lor.Pictures don't reflect that at all.Received all solid lors none of the cute patterns/designs shown.Ultimately I did order it in another lor because I was pretty pleased with it.The lors are nice and bright as show on the picture.These arrived in the lors pictured exactly.I love the lor though and still think it's very cute.Other than the sizing issue its cute.First things first, the print is beautiful.I also thought the lor would be darker.Instead, the lor wasn't as vivid as expected.the gray isn't really a clean gray.The lors are very vibrant, however, and the design is nice.Top is little big Beautiful lorNot really it broke and I love the lorIt appears clear in lor.Also, the lor of the Taupe" dress was not as depicted in the photos.The lors are not varied to the extent as shown in the picture.The lors are great on this top, very vibrant.It's very light gray.Love the bracelet, but the lor of the beads are off.The clear beads have a blue hue to them.The black bohemian print fit perfectly and I love it- super cute)but the cream/olive dress was large up top.However its a classic logo and the price is goodOne bright green, one blue.They hold their lor well too.I love my other Degree pants the solid lors).I will be returning this pair and ordering another solid lor.It's super cute, vibrant lours, but it's rather wide and short,It isn't very pink at all.I wish that had been more obvious in the picture.Not sure if I would buy them again, I probably would because there fit is perfect but I would stick with the darker lors to avoid any issues with transparencyI like the lors though.The fur and lor was nice but I just think it would look nicer if you were taller.So my fix is just not to wear this vest with white or really light lors.The flower looks beautiful but the lor of the chain is a bright gold.I ordered the pink and I did like the lor.lors are brighter in person.the stripes are a neon choral-ish lor, not the softer pink in the picture.Can be worn alone, but not beside real goldThe lor is not pretty in person.not mirrored.just pink.I got the black pair too and those still look greatThey are cute and I've gotten a few wears out of them.Cute but would have been nice to know it was bright pink not IU redThe lor is not as bright I was wantingFits ol, same lor as pic.I ordered the blue and white one.Color was true to the photos.Liked it better in pic, not as expected have returned it.I like the lor and style...not very durable.Very different shade of yellow than I expected it to be.I will probably buy in another lor.I like the blue lor and the style.I got a -pack with a plain pink with red paisley-floral pattern, a plain blue panty, blue with blue paisley-floral, and a plain lavender.Nice lor, fun, innovative.This necklace is cute but the lor is not white.The daisys are a faint pink maybe a blush, so it doesn't match the dress I had plan on wearing with it.the lor was totally different I was expecting more of a teal blue not a deep darker blueColor is dark gray instead of blackIt also helped to mask the navy blue of my maternity pants under lighter lored tops.It light mfortable,and nice lor.lor is as shown.however, it didn';t look as good on me.The shape, the lor looks exactly like a picture so thats a plus.Overall ok for a day at the beach, fun peppy lor.I didn't get the same lor.Got the orange logo instead of the yellow.The red, white, and blue strap is greatI NEEDED the lor purple advertisedIt's more of a pink than purple.Not what I expected, a little shorter than I thought they would be and not even close to the same lor blue so I have to get more jeans in the rrect lor.I have this shirt in blue and really love it so I figured I would get the black one too.Its a beautiful suit, and ol how you can wear it either solid lor or peack print, loving that optionThe earrings are okay, they're noticeably different lors, one is very blue and the other is very green.In Gildan, a X fits perfectly on me but in Liquid Blue that would be a X.Ordered biggest size in this lor, which I did in the other lors too.I loved the lor and the style of the dress was what I expected.Also, the lor was more of a light Camel ( I understand that there was a disclaimer about the lor.)That is not what I orered, but I love the bag, just wish it was a different lor.I was expecting grey.Print is beautiful but it doesn't flare out like the picture depicts.The picture shown here is a light baby blue, but the actual lor is way brighter.It doesn't really match our bathroom lor theme.If you are willowy than by all means, order them.Color is beautiful and picture.The lors are a bit deceiving, as the pink is much more pink in real life, too much for my liking.Runs a little small but I do love the lors.Gorgeous dress, lor is just like the picture, but order about sizes up.I got this in pink.THIS ISN'T WHITEStill a nice at but change the lor name to cream.(Like the woman in the picture)I'll probably use it close to Christmas time since it's a nice deep red lor.It was light, like I wanted it to be.It is also more of a teal than emerald green.Its more of an orangeI got this in black and gold and another that's gold and teal.the white lor is a bit see through, maybe good for the beach, but not for regular wear.Going to try sz up, really liked the print/lorI got it in an XS.the print i got came in perfect print.Didn't like the red, white, and blue stripes with the top oranges and turquoise.I like the lor mbination, but that's about it.The lors are really bright too.So if you order the dress remember that.I bought the black and white bodyn piece, I kept the white one, but wish I had just returned it.Color is cute.I wanted a purse to match my wallet I have with the same pattern.I like the overall lor.The lor and design was nice but I wouldn't buy it again.On the positive side, it's a nice shade of blue and I like that it has pockets.The lor is not quite bright as the pictureExactly what I want if the decal was not falling off of the shirt when I got itThe lor I ordered is beige, but it leans toward yellow.I'm picky about my leopard print.I wanted the blue and gold,but the silver and gold is ok.Colors true to pictures.It is definitely purple as opposed to royal blue.Dress is absolutely gorgeous on me but not the right lor I chose.Color is nice.I'm a CNA and have no issues keeping this on however the lor was lighter than I expected or wanted thought I was getting dark pink and it came very light pink.Just not similar to the photo or what I wanted.too many bright lors and repeats of lorsThe solid lors have drawstrings but the prints don't.The lor/style I got the multilor one) is fun.Love the different lorsThe red ral lor is actually a bright orange.Nice wallet, but I ordered the brown looks like a darker brown in the pic) when I got it, it's orange like Donald Trump.Pretty ring.Bought it for the style.Much brighter and more intense then the images.The only issue was I ordered the lor brown based on the picture but the actual lor that arrived was a Carmel light brown.I didn't return it because the other lor options didn't meet my needs but would have liked the darker lor you should change the picture.It's cute but it's a lot more Caution Cone orange then a tan orange.It's bright in lor and really pretty onThe shirt itself is very soft and true to lor.It goes perfectly with it, and it is the lor I expected.Nice ColorI'll definitely be getting more in different lors.I didn't exchange it because it was actually the other lor I was nsidering, and it's still a nice basic lor.The lor wasn't as bright as I expected it to be.Pretty lor print, but I wouldn't remmend buying.Also I would like that cape that I assumed was attached to the back.I'll keep it because I really like the lor and I'll alter the top so I can wear it.It's more of a girly lor, and I have a boy.It was pink when I got it PINK)all others where dark lors, this is the first light lor I bought, but it is pretty see through and a very thin material.The lor said navy blue.When I received it the top ver and the strings were purple and the stripes were navy blue would have been perfect if it was all navy blue as stated.Colors are much more muted than expectedIt turned by finger a little green after about weeks of wearing it.When I received the scarf some of the dark lors were faded into the lighter lors.I wish that they had and x-small because I love the lors and the cut.The lors is not quite right either.But the lor is very nice.The picture shows this hat as a light tangerine orange.When I opened the box it was a bright, borderline neon orange.I realize it's all preference but bright orange doesn't look good on my kiddo while light orange does.Beautiful lor... definitely got what I paid for, but they still serve their purpose well.The lor was exactly how it looked on the mputer The lor isn't as muted as the picture suggests, it's bubblegum pink.I Like the lor of dress.Great lors runs small(', lbs) Also the suit lors are not as saturated in real life.The image isn't as vivid as shown.I will try a different brand.The lor was lighter than shown in the picture as well.I just ordered a few more of these shirts in different lors because i think I'll get a lot of wear over spring and summer.The white is pure white but cream white.Color varies depending on ambient light green to yellow-green ochre.Other than that, it is a nice shirt with a very good, rich black lor.The picture is a true representative of the top and its lor.It's lightweight and pattern/lors are OK.The dress is nice but the lor is not a light PINK as shown in the picture.It is more of a ral/mauve lor.The silver part of the pendant is not sterling and will turn green, but otherwise it's pretty.It is more blue.The tan ones were a total NO GO and the purple ones I can wear easily but they are cut much narrower than the original Cheeks athletic sandal.Also be aware that in the picture its a violet shirt with lilac flowers and blue/green leaves.But in person the flowers are almost bright pink, the shirt is more of a royal/eggplant purple making it too girly" for most men.Also white with red alligators became pink with red alligators but was washed in warm water so grandson was not happy but did wear them.Loved the lorLiked the pattern.However, the dress I received does have very cute lors there are more purples and dark rals) and fits me perfectWish they had more bright lors.Very cute but the sequin stabsI expected this to be a black ring with gold accents, however the one I received is gold with no black at all.Love the lor and the flow of the blouseHowever the print stayed in tact.It's an ok dress; just not what I expected from the picture.The lor is definitely black and white, not with the hint of grey.Put my finger right through the black ones the first time I tried them on and I don't have long fingernails.The only problem with it is the black lor has rubbed off the I Love You on the ring.You can still tell it says I LOVE YOU but it is no longer black.The lors and design are adorable though.The lor emerald green is not as it is on the picture.Not yellow more like lemon lime.The designs are cute but the green lor matching of the shirt and shorts just do not matchI know it doesn't make a difference to him about the lors but as a parent you want your child to dress in matching lors even if it is just to sleep.NOT a pretty bright blue at allI thought I was getting more of a mint lor, but I received more of a grassy/Aqua darker green.And the lor was spot on.The white and the hot pink.The white ones are okay.I will buy additional if more lors and styles beme available.Love the lor and uniques design.It is nice fabric with pretty lors and pattern.My hopes were let down once I opened the package to see taupe and not gray.Casual ver up but lor much lighter than the photoThe lor of the shirt is more light than on the picture.I was hoping for a more pink tint as on the picture.Ok but not full like pictureI now have regular clothes that are pink.It was more of a pinkish nude lor and not gold.It is a beautiful dress, true to it's lor and for the price it's a great dealProduct description on the lor was not what I received.This dress is a py of a designer dress.I received a royal blue shirt not navy blueThe lor is exactly like in the pictures.All in all, its a pretty bracket.I really love the print and the lors, but the skirt is a simple tton skirt and is not worth nearly .The lor was the perfect pink I was looking for though.The blue is not the pretty powdered blue as shown in the picture it is more of a grey/blue but it still looks great.Not as bright as shown.It looks navy blue and not dark gray.Like several others I've purchased just recently, it's well made, will probably last quite awhile, but the photo shows grey and lavender.Just make sure you aren't expecting soft grey and misty lavender.I usually wear pearl, or faux pearl earrings, but I wanted some in other lors to ordinate with outfits.The lors are pretty and there is a nice variety.Not as spring like" of a lor as I had hoped.Color is off.love lorthe lor is lighter than was shown in the picture.First the lor is beautiful but definitely toupe not pink.Color is fantastic but...I wanted to buy more lors, but won't be doing that.And fyi, the alligator ones are pink not white.In my case, this meant basic black/white/nude.I love the hat and I love the lor.Very cute, great lors, i got a X.I think getting it in another lor might help as well.My year old was excited to see the lors blue and black as the initial picture.I am returning the Wham Bam as I thought I was getting a red lor and it turned out to be more of a orange/pink/peach.The green lor is bright and lovelyThe blue blouse fades and bleeds, do not wash with lighter lors.Cozy but lor is a little off.I should also add that I ordered dark grey and the lor is more of a dark blue which was disappointing.As you can see by the picture there is a difference in lor.There's nothing wrong with your bands except for the lor difference.PICTURE IS NOT THE SAME COLOR OR STYLE.This was an OK bracelet for the money however the chakra lors red and orange are not exactly accurate as they are both red.I love the printThe dress is lovely, the length is perfect for my " and and flows well and wide, and the lors are as shown in the picture.Its not brown but just a darker tint.Not as long as it looks in the picture.Great pattern, I got the tan/black mbo.lor not like picture, also looser knit than picturei wear it because the print is nice.This looks hot pink and that is what I expected but what I got was burgundy.The sapphire blue lor in the photo is beautiful but I received teal lored stones.Would have given stars if the lor was accurate.Glows green after letting it sit in a black light for bit.Pretty and large ring not ecpenciv looking or as dark as pic the stone is like a raspberry lor but it's very pretty for what you are paying.The lor is accurate to the description and picture and I love the style.In the pictures it was solid tan, no black outlining.Nice lorRegardless, it's everything my daughter uld want in one piece of clothing: flowers, ponies, bows, and the lor pink.Adorable style, lor, and print.Nice lor nice material but way too short.The lor was great, pockets good I'd sized right I imagine the drap would be nice.Adorable hat, cute lors, great verage.I ordered a pink but received a deep wine lor which I did not care for.The only issue I had is the lor.Not really a rose gold tone more like a pper toneColor has worn off of the mpass.Then they shouldn't be highlighted on packaging.Not Maroon but red.Overall I think it's cuteBlue is just okLooked nice at first, but the lor came off almost instantly in the water.Great pair of white pants.They are tinted amber, so everything is like sepia-lored when you wear them.I like the white ones.The green is bright in the pics but are so dark it's hard to tell they are green.The shirt is not as bright as I imagined.Color is too muted and washed out.The belt actually is black instead.Other than that the print is gorgeous just like the pictures.It is also a very nice lor red.Color is way offwas not the lor I expected.The lor is not rose gold.It's more like a yellow gold with a faint hint of rose.This was cute and lorful it worked well for a gift for an acquaintance Christmas).love the lorLiked them overall they run small and are not as long as expected the lors were way off on of the I ordered.the royal blue was navy blue and the orange was a yellowish orange very light lored.The white black ral and fascia were spot on with the lors.Color is not what is shown, quality was not as expected.The quality is good but the lors were not as pictured and unappealing for a little boyAnd the patch lor is very off too.It's not brown it is more tan.The lors are vibrant and pattern matches that of in the picture.The lor on-line was not the lor of the shirt.Listed as a pink watermelon, it's very much a orangy melon lor.They only difference was their lor; so I thought.The lor doesn't match the picture, not a soft yellow, I think they sent me Gold instead.The lors were as pictured, I ordered the XL which fit like a M. We decided to just keep the vest because it took over a month to receive it.But everything else was good and the lor is niceLike lorThe lors are great, but these are not made of tton.I definitely kept it because I like the lor, the style and the price was goodI'll be in shoes.not exact like photoLove the hat but received the blue instead of black.Additionally, I received a mpletely different orange pair that does not have Edvard Munch's The Scream my favorite).It is more of a cream lor than off white.I thought the bow lor navy but it is black not matching togetherFun for a little bit, however, the lor is leaving super fast.While this sweater has a nice style and lor, it is very thin.beige was not my lor so I gave it away return was not worth the hassle/) kept the light green.It's fine for the price, lors are true.Very orange red lor.It is actually blue, very blue.Good but too large and the pink is not as light as the pictureThe dress was absolutely beautiful and the exact mint lor we were looking for.It's very cute, but the lorful circles won't stay glued down and the ribbon around the bottom won't stay glued together.I wish you had it in black.Color is bright and cheerful.I got the blue and white while it looks alright the picture looks better.Buyers beware the blue dress, the top is brighter than the bottom.From the picture, I expected the wig to be more of a tton candy pink, but it is definitely hot pink."Color is more light yellow.I bought a pair of these at Macy's and liked it so much I got a send pair on Amazon.The ring is mfortable to wear, but I just really didn't like the lor.I have a wam skin tone, so I returned this and got the true gold lor instead.At least the lor is nice.I'll also mention, the loring of the cream/off-white does look more like a beige when received.But I was hoping for more stunning array of bright lorsral lor is lighter, not as dark as it seemsIts nice but it looks different onlineGreat lor and easy to put on, but it runs really small.I love the lors on these skirts.On the upside, the fabric is thick and it's a beautiful light pinkish lor.Color isn't a white as Its displayed but its nice.The middle stone is very dark.Didn't care for white dotsIt is bright yellow rather than the gold in the photo.I ordered the white and the black.Much more pink when it arrived.Style I like but not the lor.I ordered two pairs of xs ..one in red the other one ne in blue It's like a blend of yellow and gold.I ordered the mask because of lor it is ol.I wish it were in other mplex graphic lor.adopting this lor as my new favoriteThe lor and detail pattern are both very nice, so I decided to pass it along to a family member rather than return it.I love the lor, it is just as pictured.Product ran small and the green is not as vibrant.Haven't worn this yet but I did try it on.The lor is pretty and it's cute and swingy and short as pictured I'm '" definitely a mini).I asked for a pink and received red, which end up okay as it was a gift.It is more if a mauve than pink.I wish I had tried a solid lor.Be aware that the lors are nowhere near as vibrant as the pictures...Otherwise they were nice lorful.Beautiful print.The lors are really bright.Color scheme wasn't as ol as pictures online.I ordered the top in Khaki, which turned out to be a decent tan lor and ok with my olive skin.More opal than white.It is off white.I ordered the wine lor and it is beautiful.Loved the style and lor but had to send it back.The lor is not as shown in picture..It is a brighter green not darker green as shown.Saturated lors.turned my ears greenLike the lors, though.The lor is exactly as pictured and the fit is great.Orangey pink.It would have if lor was as pictured.Love the red lor.The lor is true to picture.I ordered these for my sisters in law's lockets and when I recieved them, they looked more like blue topaz than emerald.They are nice but they are not rose gold they're yellow gold.Was drawn to this for the lors and the cut.Not as cute as white would beThe lor is spot on.The picture makes the lor look more vivid than it actually is after being under the light.Interior of the at is black.While the lors are super pretty, it is huge and the block pattern is horizontal instead of vertical at the armpits and waist so it's not flattering at all.The lors faded a little bit in the wash, so after one washing it no longer looks brand new.Love the print but she won't she able to wear till like August if she's lucky.Beautiful print but if you have hips and thighs this isn't meant for you.The lor is great exactly like the picture and the material is great very thickThe blue in the picture is brighter than it is.The magnetic closure is awesome, and I love the lor and style.As it turns out, I got a mpletely different flower pattern, as you can see.The lor is beautiful and true to the picture.Off white in lor and run large.I ordered two other lors that fit great.They were super cute and the image on the top was clear and vibrant.Beautiful blue.Cute lor and if you are not busty this will look marvelous on you.The lor did not translate well in real life.I own many pair of gold Toe navy blue socks.These are almost exactly the same lor as my Black Gold toes.Its a nice lor.I love the black pendants and would like to put them on something else.its ok but not the same from the picture.I was expecting more a fire engine red lor, whereas this is definitely darker and leaning towards the rust lored side.I was hoping to buy more of these in several other lors, but I may I'll hold off.Other than the lor, it's a very nice bracelet.Daughter seems to like these and lots of lor choicesThis really was a beautiful dress but the lor was off, which is why it only gets stars.While I expected it to be the light, robin-egg blue in the photo, it was mint green.Still beautiful, and will still wear, but I was hoping for that blue.I liked the shirt okay but it's not the lor I thought it would be AT ALL.Blue lor is absolutely stunning.The lor however for the burgundy was much brighter in person than the photo shows, but I still love the dressAlso, I thought I ordered the all white, but I got white/ black instead.Purple looks burgundy and vice versa.I went against my better judgment and purchased burgundy hoping for the purple one.I ordered two in different lors.The dark blue one came out as the picture described and fits perfectlyOverall cute but would have gotten more stars if both came properly seen together.Love the print on this tee.Ordered and thought I was getting the lors pictured totally didn't.Bright and printed...Fit fine but was looking for more muted lors.Not the lor I ordered.Overall, everything was perfect and just as described and pictured, so stars for that.It fit ok but I was looking for a ral lor, and it was definitely just pink.They are nice deep dark blue lor and the rips are nicely placed.My real issue is with the lor.That being said, the lor I got the fushia) and it's very nice and it arrived very quickly.Pros: The lour was true and beautiful.Red is my best, and it's a nfidence-booster.Nice lor mbo.Color is not as vibrant.ALSO THE COLOR ISN'T AS DARK IT A LIGHTER BLUEThey are more of a cream lor than a white.Not the lor of blue I neededPurchase the black longOverall, I like it..very lorful.Order way up ladiesThe ring: A deep bronze loring.I will be returning this blue floral one but keeping the houndstooth one.I chose this lor because I thought it would be bright and stand out if it fell to the bottom of my purse, or was left on a table or any other scenario, I just wanted something eye catching.Colors are accurate with photo.But I like the lors.Set to a single lor or let them run the rainbow.The lor is nice and bright.Color was much different than what I expected.Love everything about it, with the exception of the stripes that totally don't match the patterned top.The lors clash.When you rely on your monitor for judging the lor in a purchase, I guess you deserve what you get.Pros- The lor is pretty.OK for the price, I bought several pairs in different lors, that was the selling point for me.I had an interview at a mpany whose lors are navy and gold and needed this in a pinch.The lors are great and true to what they appear in the description.Wish the lors listed were true to product.Nice lor and not expensive.No buttock and it was big on me I purchased black and it is nice if u don't mind see through The loring isn't quite what I wanted when I thought I was getting green.It came in a dark blue lorI purchased the Lacey Opal Septum Ring in Purple and as soon as I got it I was in love.My only mplaint is that the lors bled.The red and the blue were in the white stripes.Very flat frames and not as hot pink in person.It was the red pants w stars and the blue elephant shirt.I just hope all the other ones are true to lors I like things to matchI want to give stars...I bought the gray one, loved it.I wear the gray to work and get tons of mpliments.I hope it's not like the black.I bought two, one in gray and one in black.I don't shower with it but my boyfriend showers with his and it hasn't changed lor.The reds are more of a pinkThe lor is vibrant in the photo.The lors are not represented rrectly as pictured.This is a cute bikini set, standard black top and bottom had rich lor.Colors are vibrant and dress is pretty.Very nice lor and design but it's just not the real african fabricOrdered the black w. White flowers...l received the navy blue with beige flowers...disappointedThe lors are nice its navy with a shine like purple.Wish this was a bit brighter, since it's all yellow it is a bit faded.These were a little darker lor than expected.I ordered this dress in green and black, both size , in order to decide which lor I preferred to wear to an upming military ball.The green was exactly as pictured and the lace is very nice.In the green, I am barefoot, in the black I am wearing about " heels.Nearly highlighter lors.Great lors and picture is pretty true to life.Bought this in black and in pink.Okay, but would be better without the pink trim on the outside rim.This dress is NOT the lor in the photo it is more of a cerulean blue and you can clearly see the pattern of the dress.Cute, but it doesn't glow in the darksomehow I expected something more burgundy in lor.these are purple.The lor is right on point with the pictureFast shipping, rose gold lor was true.Otherwise the lor is greatbut great lor and fit.I just wish they were what I thought they were as advertised light brown.The lining around the shirt is an off white lor not white like the stripes on the shirt.Great qulity, but aqua-blue loring is not as vibrant as shown.Seemed well-made and a great lor, however.It's cute and glittery, and goes with the overall spider theme.The red is a rhodamine red, not a true red--more like a wine or pinky red.There is very little, if any green in the scarf, and what little green is in the scarf is an army/olive green.First and most importantly the lor was totally wrong.I double checked that I actually had ordered the mustard lor I wanted and sure enough, I had.What I got was more pumpkin lored.I looked at the lor selections and didn't even see the lor I had received as an option.Color and pants are amazing.Seemed like I was well made, and the lor as nice, but very large.It's not worth returning the item over, because overall it's cute but it is not a true red.If you're looking for a nice red top...don't choose this one; you'll be stuck with a nice orange top instead.Without all the pretty lighting and bright green nature backgrounds it's just a clear globe with a white dandilion petal(petal?).I will keep the hat, but I would not have purchased it if I had known what the real lor was.The lor is doable.The chain was darker and not as nice looking, and the back of the fish is a lot darker like the chain.It's very cute and the lors are vibrant.It's pictured as a gold pendant with a pale blue loring around the outside.In actuality, the outside lor is white.This is neon yellow, not just a primary yellow.I really wish it were a normal yellow.But I don't know why the lor is different.I ordered the black and white and they sent me the multi lor.I like the lor and the padding.When the shirts arrive, the lors are rich and vibrant.Shame, because the royal blue lor is quite lovely.The lor is great, the material is ok.So so if polarized would be great I do love the framesI was hoping to receive an olive-green tie, but what I received was more of a lighter lime-green.Color was a darker brown than expected and not the olive brown like seen in the photo.Very cute, love the lors.Pretty lors.its well made but it was super dark blue, more towards navyblack.i thought the lor would be like on the picture.The majority is just black.Better in photos.But I did buy two more pair and am hoping they will be better they are all one lor.However, the blue is not vibrant and bright as pictured.It's more of a dusty blue, soft and muted.The red and green stones are not as pretty as I hoped they'd be.Got a whole different set of lors and style.Really bright red lor.The lors aren't nearly as vibrant as they appear in the photo.I love the design and the lor.Wish it had more blue in it than black and red.The metal has a rose orange gold lor not a yellow lor like real gold.The lor is more of a sky or very light blue.It's not true to the picture.The lor is very dark, but it is indeed amethyst.I like the lor, etc.The wine lor is alot more of a bright red then it looks in the picture.It's still nice I was just looking forward to the deep wine red that is pictured.The lors are very vibrant.I like the lor much better in the picture than in real life.Great lors and I like the length.I bought them with the idea that they'd be nice bold lors like the picture but sadly they are not.The black and white ones are solid however all the others are pretty transparent so they don't stand out as well as I'd hoped, especially the teal.This item is wonderful in lor.Why does this green garment have a blue/teal neck trim?The lor was darker then I thought it would be, I got it to match my wedding ring but it's to dark.Still a very pretty shirt but I wanted mpletely white for a bachelorette afternoonI ordered the blue gradient dress and there is purple in it.It does NOT match the lor that I received.But it turned my finger green after only days of wear.Color was what I needed.I'd like to give four stars but I went with for a few reasons: I thought it was going to be red white and blue based on the picture in lor.i got silver not goldThe lor is nice as it goes with everything.I got the brown one.I love the lors and the style.The lor is nice, but was a littleNot black, dark grey.Very ol print but I think I have a long torso.The lors are vibrant and it goes well with some outfits I have.Fit and lor weren't quite as expected, but excellent customer service and was a no hassle return.Every brand is different.The patterns and lors are nice.It is a very cute outfit and fit perfectly but the shirt had a pink tint it wasn't white.I like the lor but it uld have been a bit more about around the waist.I purchased this in royal blue first in a medium.The shade or yellow is very pale and then red is pale too.lor was very nice.The patterns are pretty.The design and lors on these are ol though.I ordered this dress in white for my daughter's Christmas performance.It was a cream lor, not white.The picture doesn't really do the holographic effect justice, it's more lorful and pretty.I gave this stars because this dress I got is ROSE GOLD and the picture shown is a GOLD dress.The lors were gorgeous, but the fit was just not right on me, personally.The lor is not really white, as advertised/titled.The lor is more like aluminum blue toned).But if you want a true white gold look, this is not it.The lors are not the same as pictured that's why I only gave stars, I will have to find black bottoms to match because the top has no lime green in it at allThe lor is nice but seeing as the shirt is rediculacely short I do wish I had bought black rather then green.Also, the lor isn't a lovely salmon like the picture but more of a highlighter orange.The lor is more of a jaded green verses the emerald green that is pictured.Ordered this in Rose, very pretty lor, a deep pink, not too bright.The plum is a beautiful dark shade.I'm not fond of the bright yellow waistband.Navy Blue and Tan instead of Black and White.Such a shame because the lor and fit were great.Color is great.I loved the pattern and lor, but just can't wear it.The white is more of an off white or cream lor.The gray is much darker than pictured- i was expecting a lighter gray, but it's just GRAY.Not a happy lor...The lor is exactly as pictured.Color wasn't as it is advertised.I loved the lor.Bright orange was what I was looking for.I really do love the lacey look to the shirt and the lor is beautiful.more lorful in the picture than life.The lors were okay, but not as bright as pictured.It is a very very light pink.More like a baby pink.Got the solid rainbow lors of these.I gave it stars because the print is not as clear as I would like it to be and the lors uld be brighter.nice lor but a little too small in the behindThe graphic print is cute and modern.Winter white not pure white if that is what you are looking for.Maybe it's the lor mint green.A darker lor might be more flattering.It's a very nice suit, and I love the lor but the sizing is way off.But it's cute overall.Pretty but I wished they came in gold tone tooDidn't look like the same olive lor when it arrived.Color of under material doesn't match pink well enough.It's more of a light grey and not what I expected.The lour was good but the fitting was not It was too big.The aqua lor is beautiful.I didn't read the lor.The dress is just what is pictured.Might be better if the lettering was white, after all, this is the reason why we buy the shirt.Love the design and lors.Darling style, but I would not call the lor scarlet, more of an orange-red tone, but still good.Color is beautiful, it's an emerald green with hues of blue when the light hits the sequins.Great logoColor as shown.This is a lovely design but the one I received was much more orange than pink.It was not at all the shade shown.Not the best nstruction, but the lors are exact.Size down and buy a dark lor is you're still going to buy it.First off I ordered gray and got a white shirt also this is a total knock off. stars only because it is not yellow but more of a yellow ochre/forest green lor.Lovely lorsThese are super cute and I love the pink stone, but they were very tinyThe light blue didn't fit at all.If you order the black lor, it is jet black, not like the Amazon photo where it's grayish.Cute set but the blue top does not match the tutu.Love this, but looks different lor in pic.Wish they had it in black and grey.Color is lovely, quality is good.I did not want to take the chance as most non- gold or silver turns me green.Very nice and fit as expected, the lor was way off ordered a royal blur thinking I was getting blue and they were navy blue.Just would have liked a normal blue lor.The gray is quite lovely so I will keep it but it wasn't as advertised.The lors are the same as pictured, mint, green, and navy.I love the lor, but I should have listened to other reviewers who state this shirt is very large.I gave it three starts because I did not get the style shown in the images.Nice variety of lors.Would have been so much better if they'd made each letter a diff lor.Love the slogan, but the writing on the hat is almost pink, not white as expected.Arrived fast only thing that was different was the lor on the shirt was a yellowish White not pure whiteTMNT thermal shirt the Colors are BRIGHT the Printing is CLEAN.Cute and neutral lorI just kept to mix and match top.True to lor however i had to adjust the dress for the perfect fit.The picture shows a variety of lors but it's clear, white, black, and champagne in lor.This was rose gold and not yellow gold.I ordered this specific lor due to the lors of my wedding pink and red).The lor is just as you see it which they called camel however it's a definite a gnac lor.I bought one in black and one in grey.doesn't have the quality shown in the photo more red than burgundy redSilver finish wore offThe print and lor is awesome.But I purchased this shirt because I like the arbor logo in the lors.Good fit but the lors is not as vibrant as they are in the pic.Photo with black remote for lor reference.The lor looks kind of blue in this picture, but the suit is black with pink polka dots and really cuteI ordered the black, royal blue and white hat.The Silver Mirrored John Lennon Style sunglasses offer a nice splash of unique style to anyones wardrobe.Bought pair in different lors.I was hoping for a smaller stone, personally, with more lor to it, so it hasn't really met my hopes for what it would look like.Was kind of disappointed since I liked the lor so much, but I'm glad that I'll still be able to wear it.Print is great and lor is as shown.Dress was beautiful but I returned it because the lor of the lace sleeves was different from the lor of the dressthis pic does not show this is a button up with a lor.Overall, ok for pajamas.Colors and material are great.Do love the red lor.It appears to be a peach lor in the web picture.The lor I ordered was a dark burgundy and I really like the lor and received mpliments on it.was not green as it appearI was hoping for a brighter red.I don't think it looks the same in person as it does in the picture and the lors on the top aren't as vibrant, with that being said it is still a cute dress.a lot of the same but different....example several flowers but different rose, daisy, sunflower, ect) I ended up doing bracelets for different people...so it worked out OK.Definitely not the same in the pictures.It's very lorful.The shirt is more peach than pink, so it's closer to Zoidberg out of his shell than in.I purchased one in green and one in red.next time upload the rrect picture with the rrect lorBut the chiffon material that is over the front is not as dark as pictured, it's more of a rnflower blue, not a royal blue.It is purple.Royal purple.It fits as expected and I really love the lor.It's not perfect but I really loved this lor and the st is very warm here in CT for winter.Get this style in a darker lor if you can.cute skirt vibrant lors not as long as picture shows... if you have a ample derriere skirt will riseThe lor is more teal than emerald like the picture.It does look exactly like the picLove the lors and fit, but a little see through.Color does not match what I received, but they are beautifulWill be returning for another lor.Color was beautiful, but I wasn't a fan of the material.The lor matches the one described in the picture.Not what I was looking for, if you want it to match white gold, don't pick this ringBut I had to return it b/c the neon yellow is way more neon and green than shown in the photo.The lor was way offPretty for a beach ver up maybe but my bathing suits are all darker lors that would show right through so I don't think I will use it.It's a beautiful top, and I love the lor.The lor blue and material is nice.I wish there were more with solid lors.It's true to its picture but it doesn't pop.Great shirt for the money, but whatever the lor Adobe means, it is not the lor of the shirt pictured.Mine arrived in a more of a red lor.Great shirt if your lor blind.I expected vivid lors.I love the lor and size.The lor of the dress was very pretty and the blue was what I was looking for my son's wedding but sadly I decided it was not the dress I wanted to wear for the special day.The red is a really pretty lor and is more of a true red, not an orange red.I'm not that fond of the nude lor, but it would be OK for under light lored clothing.Black, red and nude.)I bought the yellow one for a stume and when you out it on you can see my underwear, spanks Everything.I ordered the dark grey wallet, I received an emerald dark green) lor.I wanted grey so it would match, oh well.Everyone liked the overall appearance of the shirt, but the red lor does start to bleed into the central design after or washes.Good lors otherwise.I purchased the white-- it is definitely see through by itself.Bought this because my job required me to have this lor.I have this three stars only cuz it is mfortable and arrived before the estimated time but I ordered the emerald green and unlike the true green it shows in there picture it is more a mint shade.I normally love this name brand, but I was expecting true black.These were more of a denim lor.The lors were true to description and picture online.lors were not as vibrant as appeared on the websiteThe lor is beautiful a rich teal.Liked the look.This shirt is ok but doesn't look as nice as it does in the pictures.The lors were different than the picture by a lot, but it was still an attractive bathing suit.Wasn't the same lor.The patterns do not match up...Definitely not the burgundy-red as pictured.It fits well but the lor was a little off...a lighter shade of greenLooks like image, except, I wanted tton, as they had listed at the time I ordered it.I like the versatile lors.It is very VERY GREEN not the blue-green I was expectingThe lor is beatiful but the size noI love the lor and printMy son age ) says some lors look brighter, but it wasn't a dramatic change like some people I have seen on the videos.Color cute though.The print is rich and clear tho I just wish i had the right sizeSeriously you can only wear beige or light grey underneath.I bought the navy lor.I can say that the lors are cute.Very pretty but turns my finger green.I received navy and one charal... the charal and black were really the ones I wanted (It's not right to advertise them as a pack but they aren't all lace patternI also got this in black, this one isn't quite as long as the black, and the inner end isn't as well put together on this one as the black one was.The lor is more red" than it appears here.I purchased the black floral print with long sleeves and the white at the same time.Nice lors and good to mix with another bracelet I purchased.The purple on the screen is much richer than the lor of the actual shirt.Color is vibrant and it fits well.It's not as long as it looks from the picture.The print itself is just okay, uld be a little darker so that it stands out.Love the bottoms but the top was too big so I had to substitute the top with a plain black one and it worked out fine.Bummer because it is super cute, the lor is nice, and it seems to be good quality.So I really appreciate the variety in lor in this ring.It has the darker tone which you rarely see unless you are looking for it on purpose or a llector.was hopping for more blue instead of gray smoky onesThe yellow was not as bright as the picture lets on and the bracelet was broken when it came but the design is beautifulThe Royal lor is not see-thru.This is very soft and the lor is very nice.I love the lors, blue/green with short sleeves for my bday L) and dark wine lor with long sleeves and button down the front in XL).Totally agree with the five-star reviewers that these are super soft and the lors are incredibly vibrant.The dress fits fine but the skirt is bright yellow and the material under the lace is pale yellow.The red is orange... not red.Like style and lor.Love the vibrant lours but the shirt isn't bias cut for a woman's body as advertised.Print is beautiful.I was not happy with the lor.Color is not as it appears on the website.I bought Hot Pink and Light Purple.It's hard to tell from the photo but there is a lot of nude lored mesh on the top of this dress where the applique is.I ordered the bleach blonde and it is more of a light ashy blonde it doesn't match my hair well enough to use.For this price range I guess it's okay if you can get a lor that actually matches your hair.I bought this as a daily deal because I thought the emerald green lor was gorgeous.Overall very nice ring,too bad for it changing lors,Cuz I really loved this ring.I bought these for the lors.Rose gold in lor, not yellow gold- quality is decent enough, but definitely don't expect what is pictured.lor is pretty.The other problem that I had is that the dress isn't so much ivory, but a pale white lor.Very lorful, too.The blue on the hat is also a light sky blue not the lor shown in the picture.The brown is also a darker brown not the lor shown in the picture.Luckily, I also liked the bright pink lor.Just know that there is no purple in the lor.This is the send lor of this b bag that I have ordered.Other than that she loved the design and lourDefinitely not red.I didn't receive the lor in the picture.I am not happy with picture shown for the star since the star is not edged but curved.The lor is vibrant and catchy.The pink ones are ok.It has good style, lor and size on the outside.It glows a little bit green like glow in the dark stars) but not for long.much too small, otherwise lor faric are good for the price.Shirt is Ok, the lor is much lighter than the picture.My main mplaint is that the lor Rose) wasn't what was pictured online; it was a lighter, more pink hue.The lor is brilliant and the material is wonderfulColors are pale and fabric is thin.Looked very well made but the lor was way more orange than I expected.Didn't match any of my shoes.do love the lorsI got the hot pink lor.I ordered the blue, because I liked the neckline better than the other lors, but it turned out they are all the same.Looked nice at first until the painted-on lors began to peel off.also lor not what i expected.lor was not as statedWasn't purple at all.Got to match the wedding lors but it was all pink.The chevron design is pretty.Pretty lor and looks well made and I like the shirt otherwise.What I liked: the print is beautiful.Color is good.Not white dark cream lored in center.The lor for the umbrella is gorgeous.These pants are very mfortable and I love the lors.This shirt is ok but I wouldn't buy it again.The lor is okay- it's more of a salmon lor.I am still going to use them, but I will need to be mindful of the lor wearing off.The bag I received is cute BUT the lor shown on amazon for the lor jeans' looks a lot brighter online than the actual product.Also as you can see from my picture the blue is NOT bright electric blue like the product picture, it's more like a royal blue which is so much prettier.I ordered a Large in the pink.Beautiful lor, beautiful fabric.othere then that I loved the lors and designs very eye appealing.Beautiful love the lorColor is much darker then expected.It's somewhat not very dark violet with steel notes It's okay but ties are different then what's shownI do like the lor.More of a bright yellow, not mustard yellow.I ordered a yellow and its a neon green/yellow.Loved the fabric and the lors were vibrant, but just too small for me Other than that I like the lor and everything but don't think I'll be using it that much.The other I wore, is ok to keep.Even more so, hopefully I can find purple gray thread.This shirt is a nice lor.The umbrella is ol, but it looks more purple than blue.photo include.Bigger than same mpany's Electric blue design.Colors are much lighter in person and they are pretty see through.I would have given more stars if I hadn't gotten duplicate lors and no clear pair at all.only because I thought it was a bright yellow and it is not.So I ordered a different skirt same lor.This item is not red by any means.The lor that arrives was more a peach/pink with some cranberry thrown in.I'll be returning it, though, because I bought the purple and it's very dark.I'll definitely be buying it in a different lor.Not as vivid as picture.It is more green than in the picture, was hoping for that brownish green as in the pic.Color is more of a grey tinted pink than shown.I have been told that it does look OK with my watch, but that the lor doesn't quite match up.My rating as of right now reflects both of these issues.Good lor and design.The lor is not exactly as pictured but I like it anyway.Love the design, love the lor well.The white sandals are not white.They are a light yellow or beige or muslin not sure what to call the lor.Great blue lor, though and think the material would create great draping boho look on the right frame.The lors are nice and ribbon is good quality.This shows burgundy and blue in the pictures.It arrived medium brown and blue in the mail.It's not worth the st of sending back, but you need a better lor description.Unique artwork, but lors are not as vibrant as the picture would lead you to believe.But it is exactly same as the picture.Colors looked fated.The lor was very true and material soft, but the it ran small and the print was off centered..I ended up giving this to a little girl who loves pineapplesbut i don't mind and i loved print.It was pretty and the lors were nice so I kept it and gave to my year old daughter.Ordered the Red and Olive green.Accent with Color and StyleBeautiful lors, nice light material so you can wear the mpleted look with a Jacket and not be a Sweat HogThe lenses are very dark, which I prefer.The lor is not the sameThe lor was way off, more burgundy with a red bowThe bottoms fit perfect at least and are a gorgeous lor- gave the top to my sister and it fits her perfectly.The heel lights are not as bright as the ones I had before another brand).Color is beautiful,small through the bust.It is a very pretty ring.they are not shoesThe lor is as it is seen.The next size up would be better, but not so much that I am returning it.Have not washed or worn yet, but the lor is vivid and appears well put together.I WOULD LIKED WHITE.Wish I had them in every lorMy nipple bars before were long.I ordered pink/pink..Bright and lorful.Am only wearing the three rings that match this lor scheme.The blue lor I chose was disunted, but looks fine.Great lor and lots of storage pockets and slots.I ordered the mossy green shirt dress and it's true to lor in the photo.I notice it picks up what ever lor you are wearing.So it is more blue if you are wearing blue, more pink if you are wearing pink.Nice lor too, I will again order this T in different lor.One star off for the size, but other than that it was a great gift.She loves Cinderella and her favorite lor is purple, so this uldn't have been more perfect for her.Works with both white or black crinolines.The red/white/blue strap looks great on my Seiko Diver.We got the blue and pink.Great lors, Just too small for me.May try the purple instead.Only stars as the lor is more navy than the royal blue in the picture.The pink is a little darker than pictured.Everything is good, I just thought it would be a little more orange, than a pink ralAlso, the lor is fun and vibrant without being overwhelming.The lor is really pretty and unique and the bow is detachable, so it's nice if you like it more simple or with some flair.Overall this is exactly what I expected in this order, but there are gold little buttons on the jacket that can brake easily.The lor is very washed out not bright purple as I thought it would be.otherwise these overalls are greatSuper cute and vibrant lorsColour of handbag is exactly as seen in photo.Would have given five stars except delivery time was very long, plus I ordered the white scarf and got a cream-lored one.The lor is really light pink, almost a neutral lor, as picturedThis photo is not the same print as I was sent.LOOKS LIKE WHAT I WANTED.It is pretty, the lor is more towards a light pink.I plan to but in different lors and patterns.Great design with clear lines and bright lors.My preference would've been that more of the buckle would be vered by the design, but the black background of the buckle helps to hide that minor flaw".Color was gorgeous.I love the light blue lor I received/purchased, it is so soft but I can see where it's not too durable.It has not fallen off since, definitely a beautiful design and lor.But otherwise a great backpack, great lors and details.The lors are very prettyThe pink one was gorgeous.Here are my best liked to least liked: pink one, purple, clearAlthough it didn't match the picture exactly but I am still very happy with the product.Needed a Bridal Shower Dress that was a lighter lor, but not white .Love the lorsColor was rrect.But I still plan on ordering more lorsBright yellow, fits true to sizebright lors and nice topSuper cute I got the all black one.Great graphics excellent

fine.Love the mixed lors.Gold and navy is a more accurate description.I actually knew I wanted gold and navy, and the images portrayed exactly what I received.cute and different shirt, love the ral pop of lor.Everything is fine, but the lor is too bright for wine lor.They did the trick and were a wonderful orange-red lor.Liked all the lorsI love the lors and fabric but it does run large.Beautiful lor and well made.They are cute too Wish the had more multiple lor schemes like the one I bought my mother I like the lor mbo, different then what I've seen anywhere.Its about exactly as it is in the picture.The lors are vivid and it's very unique.wish they had others lors to buy.love the style wish they were darker tintOverall I like the lor and are warm.Not as broad as shown in the photo.The logo should be Silent Service SubmarineS plural not singular)The lor is a bit more tan than the image.I wish they had more lor options.I may purchase a few more in different lorsLove the print and style.We love having different lors to switch.Nice lor, plenty of blingI have a few lors.Colour is gorgeous and matches a pair of boots I purchased via amazon.Love the set up of this wallet and the lor is beautiful.They are a beautiful blue in the light and true to size.The lor is as expected, a nice dusty olive green.I got the white ver up with blue tassels, looks cute but I wish the tassels were as vibrant in person as they were in the picture they're more of a saturated blue).Very nice red.The lors are nice and vibrant.These are so delicate and pretty and the lors were great.Charm is nice but the picture looked like it was lors.Colors are pretty and received many mpliments.Depending on the lor the embellishment along the waist and how it is made is different.I got the sky blue lor, it's slightly more teal than pictured but still a very pretty lor.The lor is beautiful and the hat is nice and thick.But lor wise it's the same that was shown in the picture.The red is more of a salmon red/pink lor and the blue is more of a denim blue.If they had other lors I would order again.Very feminine but very mainstream America print.But it's mfy, pretty blue lor that is pictured) and warm, which is what I wanted.I wish they have more lors.Great fabric and lorThe blue is vibrant without about being to much It goes well with my pale blue winter at.The blue is also very vibrant.my daughter wears T and I ordered T.The grey was gorgeous.I got this in two lors.More cream than white.I just wished I would have more option on lor nsidering the - month drop down did have a bigger selection available.I bought multiple lors to go with my various ats.I would have kept it, but the shade of purple was too light for what I needed it for, so I ended up returning it.I like the lor, size, and lots of pockets.great deal for the price love the lor.Love the lor and when I first got it love the fit.I was disappointed when I opened it because I ordered white and received a khaki lor.Love the purple lor.Good lor, good pattern, easy to work with.Would order another if they had more lors available.Well, red is not my lor peopleBright lors, good buttoning.She loves the lour and said it's very cute.I only gave it stars because lors weren't as vibrant as pictured.I really did like that lor.Only wish that they had the black available.The lor is not royal purple as shown in the

gorgeous, more of a burgundy than red.Very had to find this lor.Beautiful shade of olive green.Cute as can be and gorgeous lors.Nice pattern.A little shorter than I was expecting but a nice sweater with beautiful lor.The only problem I have is that the lor does me off of some of them, but not all.But if your outfits won't work with a brass lored chain, then don't get this.They are still holding up great, just wish the lor had stayed longer.I have several on different lors or varying styles that I bought and I am happy with them, they are more like stume jewelry though, so just remember you get what you pay for.The hot pink lor is beautiful and the quality is great.I now have a light blue beltI bought both lors available and am glad I did.Worth the purchase for the price and has a very good style and lor variationHowever, the lor is beautiful and I like it a lot.This set mes with nose rings, is heart shaped and mes in purple, white, black, pink, clear, red, blue and green.They are

as the photo, but it is fairly bright in lor like a bright peach lor.The print is vibrant like a photograph The lor of the flowers are much brighter than pictured, think neon orange, rather than the more muted lor it looks like it would be.But not as pink as the picture shows, in my opinion.As others have mmented, darker silver than pictured.Love the range of lorRed, Burgundy Navy blue.Husband liked black, I, the red.Love the ral lor.I took one star off because it seems not as well made as my black one.It did arrive before expected and lor and pattern were exactly what was pictured.I like the lighter lorColors are true to what picture says.So cute, fits perfect, love the lor.But I wish they had pink in it instead of gold.The reason I gave it a star rating is because I was under the impression that lens were mpletely mirror with the lor scheme light pink on darker pink based on the imagery under its description.I had ordered another pair in a different lor with my original order, which are taking longer to arrive, but at least now, I know exactly what I will be receiving.Great lors but runs smallAfter a while the gold accents begin to fade.But they aren't yellow enough for the room I planned on using them in.I ordered the white bottoms with the strappy sides.Wish there were more lors.i love the lor of this item.Nicely made, love the lorLength was great and the lor was exactly as shown.Nice lor and looks cute for summerLove the bright lorThe lors and designs are pretty.I was very pleased with this top that I got it in two lorsthe lor is more of a black and ivory not

customer.But I was wrong the fit is great the lors and detail are exactly as pictured.Great design and lor.This dress is well made, a beautiful lor, and exactly what we have been looking forI love the lor and the feel of the material.The pink and beige are a bit pointy.I thought it was white and blue it is actually more cream and blue but nice hat.The lor is beautiful and vivid.Is not white...The ntrasting lors are also nice.I ordered mine in pink, which is shown as a warm blush lor, but mine was just a little more fuchsia.Even more noticeable in white than black bra I ordered both fyi.I didn't get this, but I got instead a glow in the dark locket.The dress is just as pictured.Has a very retro style.What I received instead is a plain bright) magenta sweater.I love this dress mainly for its mfortability and I adore the lor grey.I've had this ring in for about months and it's starting to change lors a little bit.I will be purchasing in other lorsThe Color of the red matched my outfit perfect.Love the light pink lor, great for under light clothes.So, I found one of my scarves that have the same lors on it and threaded them through.I knew going in that this hat was khaki lored, not pink.But what arrived was more light tan than the green lor shown in other pictures online.I like that the liner is gray and not black for easier seeing into it.Love the vibrant lor and the banded pattern though, very flattering.Comfy and cute, however the red is a very bright tomato red, not the lor in photo.I lucked out I got a black one and a dark grey one and they both fit perfectly.Very happy with my choice...I ordered a size in the light ral lor and it fits great, lor looks almost exactly like shown in the picture.About have all lors I need.as advertised...lorfulI paired it with a pants as well as a black and white pencil skirt.The lour was fantastic and the panels were flirty in all the right ways.The stone is not as red as it is shown, but people have remarked that that is good for ntrast with the peack.I would love to order more of these and hope that they start making solid lors as wellWould like other lors to choose frommore of a durag and the print is too high, but other than that its pretty niceGreat lorsThis top fits well, and it's a great lor.Was for a gift and its like photoWhen i just got was good shining just like the picture, but i made a mistake i put it in water and lor turned to dark green.I'd buy again in another lor.like this and the lor, mfortable to wearThe only down side was that it was not true red it was more tomato lor.I would almost say they're closer to teal than Jade Green, but it's not too far off and still a beautiful lor.She hasn't worn them yet but liked the pattern.This is a present for someone else but I was happy with the lor.beautiful pink lor and was a good deal.The birds symbolize my mother and me, so that's all that matter.The lors in the dress are vibrant and the pattern is beautiful.Wife

lorsIt glows brightly.The green is a dark, forest green.He will love it his favorite lor is greenThis plaid is a great lor.Earrings show a deep blue lor.However, when it arrived, it was a light blue

for my girlfriend blue and pink/green and pink) and they are ok for the price.Anyways, I will say that it you are looking for a ring to match your WHITE GOLD ring then this ring IS NOT for you.I have white gold and it is noticeably off.Next up, I will look into the balt chrome rings to match my white gold rings.A bit sheer if u order the lighter lors.Purchased the shirt with blue sleeves.I will most likely be buying another one in a different lor.Not as nice as pics depictI didn't get to use this product yet but the lors are slightly more white vs cream.The pink is definitely not as pink like in the picture but it is still a nice band.My wife liked it enough we plan to shop for one in the right lor and fur for her so she can ride in my car it has no top to put up) when it's ld out.The lors are more saturated in the pictures.Wish they had more lorsI will buy this again in other lors.The lors are great and bright, and it's very cute.They were a bit too purple for my liking, I was hoping for green to be the more standout lor.Gave them to my daughter who happens to love purple, so it's all good.Rose Gold and design very pretty.I will definitely order other lorsI have this dress in a different shade of denim and I love it.Very pretty lors.Like he lor.The only thing I would change is they were out of the lor I wanted but this one is a very pretty lor.I just wish I got the black or gray instead...I guess I felt daring the day I ordered the red, which turned out to be more of a hot ral lor.I was hoping it wa red to wear on Christmas Eve, but luckily I do love pink as well....Nice fit, lors match photo.The lor is also just what I was looking for.this is a great product and it super lorful and just zwhat i expected.I took one star off because I got two of the same lor bow.Overall I love the lors and how it looks on.Purchased for my yea old, fits well, great lors, she loves it.Love the bright lors and am so happy to have finally found a sock/liner that works so

the other reviews.The rose gold lor is a nice change from just gold lor everything.Wish it came in more lors and I would get them all.It is a nice shade of red.The size is perfect for everyday and I love the lor especially for the holidays.Absolutely love the vibrant lors.I bought both orange& white they fit perfectly under my other tshirt without rolling up.The pattern is super cute, and looks exactly the same as the picture.Otherwise, I love the lor, it stretches well across my big ta-tas and gives you a nice shape.I gave stars because the sleeve pattern in the fuchsia/ivory shirt had more of a teal leaf pattern mixed in with the floral.I love the lors and design; it looks like the picture.Light.My next decision was lor....pinklove the printThe lors, the print are as shown in the picture.It's mfortable to wear and the lors are nicer than in the picture.Color is exactly as shown in the pictureNice fabric, beautiful lor.the lor is just what i expected and the quality is amazing.I chose the navy blue so hopefully the dark lor can hide it better.The lour of the bag is burgundy and not brown as stated but I absolutely love it.It means either the pink is meant to be smaller or they have listened to reviews and made them longer.I'm actually much more pleased with the deep blue than I am the pink though just because I can wear the skirt to a n with out attracting unwanted attention.Love the print and the lor.Otherwise stars.Fits good, lor is lovely.Perfect rich brown lor.Great dress, though it is more of a ral lor than pink.Colors are not the greatest but I still love them.I love the baby blue lor and the heel is the perfect height for casual days.Colors are vibrant and wash and wear wellLove the skirt and want to get one more lorThis Cute Fascinator was

fit and lor quality will order another in red or grey.The style of this in person looks different than the photo as the lace and the lining are different lors and it looks like they are the same lor in the photo but I am still pleased with it.The lor assortment is ok.More of a darker gold lor but yellow when they are reflecting a lot of light.Just like the picture shiny and metallic.very pretty the lor is beautiful.Really like these... the lor was more pink than ral, but the return process was easy, and I appreciate that.I will likely order the pack... more subdued lors.What isn't the same is the lor of the in.Colors are great.I actually purchased BOTH lors.It does not have white under the lace but instead it is a tan lor.This isn't as cape like as I was expecting but received mpliments on the cut and lor blue).The other four were one maroon, one grey, one blue, and one blue/grey/white plaid.Very pretty greenThe lors on this dress are so pretty and it fit me very nicely.The blue stones are darker than pictured so they are not as vibrant as I had hoped.My reason for the stars is because there not the exact same as the photo and the star isn't as vibrant and cut like the picture shows.Great lors.The lor is more of blue-gray than a true navy, but I like it a lot.I really love this purse, the lor is more vivid and a bitter darker than expected but I like it.It depended on the material and lor and pattern really, since I love my graphic tees.Nice, vibrant lors.This is a super cute printReally cute, love the lorsThe plaid pattern is gorgeousHubby and I ordered pink for me and blue for him.The dress is as pictured.The lors in this are just as pictured.Colors are vivid and brighter than I thought, very eye catching.Great for the Holidays with white, black or red

purple fancy shoes.Granddaughter loves the lors purple pink.Color is very nice and it does hold a lot of cards.Mine is dark green which is nice and subtle.Good ring but faded a little towards yellow

nice.However my granddaughter loves the teal lor and begged to keep it.Color darker than expected.Colors are good.Firstly is is exactly as it is shown in the picture.It's lightweight and a great lorI love them because the lor is so shiny and bright I can always tell where he is on the fieldWe got the blue one.Design and lors are vibrant.In person it's more of a purple blue than a true dark blue.Outstanding lor and style.I ordered the black/gray/pink headbands and really like the stretchiness, fabric, and size.Color is better than I expected.I thought about returning this top but decided to keep because I like the style, sizing and the lor.Style is as shown.I liked it,loved the bright lorI may also order the pink -)Oh, but they are darker shade of purple than they appear, which I was happy about.It's royal blue, not navy blue.it's lighter in lor than the pic.there's like a smoky white lor in it.I would have prefered a darker lor but it's still a pretty crystal.the lor and style is true to the pictureThe red is more a wine lor, which I prefer over red.Loved the intense cardinal red lor, but have not washed it yet.So far there's no green residue, and I've worn it a week straight.As others have mentioned, the lor doesn't look exactly like white gold, it's a bit darker, but it's close enough.The cut and lor is wonderful.It looks on her just like it does in the picture style wise.The material and lor are very nice and it was received on time.I ordered this lor blue) for my husband and a purple one for myself.Color was great.Will order different lors.I like it.. good fit, the grey lor is lighter than the pic.Fit an lorThe blue and pink in my opinion) isn't as bright as I expected either.Adorable print.Love the blue tint.This is a good alternative if you are looking for a similar system but different belt designs or lors.This will me in perfectly when I splay Ema Asahina for YoumaCon this year.They are mfortable, the lor hasn't faded, and the pattern doesn't stretch out.I would have given stars if all the LED's were lighting.the lors are a off, i wanted to be Sailor Plut and ended being Sailor Saturn... but it was beautiful anywaysWouldn't call the lor purple...more lilac to me.But I will always buy them, love the lors.The lor was what was expected and it fit nice.It is rather small and paler in lor but still niceVery nice lors.(Although mfort may vary between you and me...) As for the lor, it's a bit darker than the photo.I ordered the gray and the lor is beautiful.And the bright green is nice, true to lor in the picture.I ordered two of these in white and gray.Colorful just right for a little girl.It was the lor as shown, but expect some variation in where the dark blue and light blue begin and stop.Love the lor and more importantly, I love the fact it doesn't ride up, now I don't pull down like I used to with the Hanes' boxers, hahaI really like this hat and its white lor.I love these and have them in many lors.The yellow lor that I purchased is exactly as portrayed in the photo.Probably going to order in a bigger size/ different lor.He also loves the orange pair his favorite lor).Just got my tounge rings today, I didn't get the loring in the picture, I got light pink, red, dark blue, green, gold, light purple and the multilored on but alot lighter.I really wanted the light blue one but I guess I don't get it.I ordered theese for my boyfriend and he likes them doesn't know the lors are different All is well besides the lors.In particular my friends mment on how much they like the lor.They make great lors, but the soft nylon fabric does attract other lors in the wash, and over time, and wearing, they start to slightly fade change lor.I know, I bought all the lors, then later bought all new in all the lors, def difference.And I wish it came and brighter lors say red purple blueThis is more white than pictured.Very vibrant blue, not quite the subtle navy lor.The pink lor is really pretty in person and it's a good quality for the price.More of a burgundy lor and oversized.Great lor and plenty of pockets for extras while traveling.It''s a very dark green.The lors are as bold and vivid as they appear to be. Degree By Reflex " Yoga Capris Lightning Blue S .As a result, I was left more nflicted as I'd liked the photo and it was my boyfriend who really nvinced me that he really liked it he doesn't like anything.I bought this to be able to wear to work it's a lor I love and it's visually interesting.Colors true to picture, design super cute, shirts are soft.Since the lor is listed as rose red i thought the lor in the picture wasn't true to life.These are pink.Nice print and great for any MH fan.The floral print is super cute too.The lor and style is greatLove the lors Also, be aware that the main lor is not true to the picture.Mmmm it's not purple is whiteIt's just red and black.I want this in another lor.I now have pink tinged hand towels.the lor was very nice wish it would've been larger...The lors are beautiful and I received several mpliments on the dress.The blue lor of the bra I received is a nice medium royal blue with flecks of almost blue/lilac.Really pretty, only problem is I ORDERED an all black version.Pretty, but the purple one I liked better.The lor I ordered was dark purple and the lors are very vivid and rich.Color and print is awesome.It's definitely the same lors as the pic.Very nice red lorThought it would be longer, but the lor is nice.Overall, a great jersey.ONLY WISH THERE WAS A LARGER INSIDE POCKET OTHERWISE I LOVE THE SIZE...I WILL ORDER IN ANOTHER COLOR TOO The lors are as expected.The red bow tie is accurately portrayed in the picture online.The bottom is a peach lor that ntrasts very well with the black top.true to imagePlease make these in more lorsI love blue and pink and purpleWhat's with the tortoise shell lor?Five stars when I can get them in a new ol lorIt was a very smart looking blue and it was easy to wheel around and through the aisle of the plane.I purchased a grey and green lor.Love the bright lors.The lor is beautiful and my baby love itNice a bright navy as opposed to dark navy.Love the lors thoughI absolutely love this ring...too much, I guess, because the silver lor turned pper and it's wearing off mpletely.I would like to order next in white if they have different lors.lol beautiful lors, feels quality.I wasn't thrilled with the lor choices, I wanted blue or brown or even tan, none of which appeared to be a choice.I don't remember the name of the lor I decided to go with, but it looked rather green.To my surprise it was actually a very nice shade of blueI got this dress in size in the lor regency.This is a very nice lor and the picture is accurate.Just as an FYI, the lor is more vivid than shown.The lor appeared peach in the photo and was more day-glo orange.Very nice ring; a little bluer in person.Nice and dark shades.The red that I got has a bit of an orange cast to it, but the lor is quite vivid.Great lorI LOVE the lor and style so much....I am keeping the bag.Love the lor and the look.I wish it came in more lorsI thought the lor was red but it's actually closer to a dark pink lor.The lors and design was just like the picture and I recieved many mpliments on it.Loved the lor and style.The only real mplaint I have with these is that the blue hoop is quite a few shades darker then pictured, but still visibly blue, and the gold is also darker then pictured, but still a good clean lor.Bought the black and forest green and they're both the same.Nice vivid lor.I will be ordering more lors.I need a ver up to wear when I lor my hair.Really pretty lors.The lor is true to the image provided.Color is much lighter then picture.It is actually a baby blue but still my son loves that they light up.But it's a beautiful lorThe lor is gorgeous and true to the picture.My only mplaint, since I bought them to match a bathing suit, is that they are not aqua as listed they're just blue.Very cute belt, stars because I ordered this in yellow and the belt itself is a beautiful, vibrant yellow but the bow is very pale yellow.Beware, The dress I recieved was a rosey/ pink gold, not actually goldI may get one in another lor.I bought the galaxy print and get mpliments on them all the time.The purple orchid lor isn't quite as vibrant as the picture, but lovely nonetheless.I also purchased the imperial purple for my mother which is rich and deep.They're long and ver my bum which is good and the lors are very vibrantThe image for the purple shows kind of a burgundy tone, so I wasn't % sure what lor I was going to get.The lors are pretty and the fit is nice.Love them except I wish I uld pick the lors and make them flash strobe style tooI would purchase them in a different lor.I will be getting more lors in the future.its a bit long, but overall wonderful lors and flow.These are mfortable and I love the lor.Wish they had more lors so I uld order even more.I want subtle lors - not neon - but I don't want want the washed-out look.Kind of disappointed, but it is warm and the lor is beautiful, so I'm keeping it.She loved the bright neon pink lor.I got lor blue- the orange is more of a camel which I loveThe lors of the dress are beautiful just like in the picture and the dress still perfect after I washed it.It is a pretty lor hot pink).I was a little disappointed that the lors and pattern were a little off from what is depicted BUT the dress was still just as beautiful.Color is beautiful.I love the lors and so does my son and he has plenty to choose from.)We don't want pink paisley.The pink is a little more muted in person than the picture shows.Love the lor, and it's super mfy.wish they had this in another lorLove the lor and length.The lors are greatThe Frat lors were ...Would have liked to try a different lor by don't know that I will due to the length of shipping, and the size variation.I love the design and how u used it and derated it.So I received my hat in green" today.The green hat is the same as the black.In person it's an emerald green.I did expect it to be a little more sparkly but it's true to the nature of the emblem and is just a flat silver.I love the vibrant lors, so sexy and fun to wear.P. S. Colors look great and socks are really cutethey are very soft and the lor is gorgeousPretty lor but leaves nothing to the imaginationBought the same pair last year in a different lor that's why I bought these.With lors available I did not think I would get duplicates.Like what's shown on the last pic.Slightly different lors however beautiful and I told everyone where I receive my necklace from when I receive mments about it.I got the Green, and it's the exact olive shade I've been searching for.I thought I bought in ivory but it is White.The reason why I sent it back.....was that the lor listed on the site says: Sky Blue.(sky blue reminds me of the lor just a little darker than pastel blue).When I opened the box that arrived quickly, inside was a Turquoise Blue.Mine is very pretty but it's solid silver without the black weathered letters.Very Nice love the lors.The lor is actually a more deeper red.When the earring lor didn't match the same as the photo, I actually liked the shade of pink it was instead of this light pink they advertised.I will order again in different lors if available as my daughter loves this pcthe lors really pop.I ordered the red" earrings and the photo is accurate, they are a peachy pink lor just as I hoped.Overall, I would buy them again.It is well made, and true to lor.I have recently ordered the pink one I was so pleased with this one.I love the lor and how it feels.Colors are greatI wish they offered them in BLUE..The only reason I am giving it stars because the lor is red not burgundy as the picture shows, but other than that I love this dress.I gave it stars because description said gold but it's a rose gold.Nice material love the lor.Overall I love the lor, and I got a lot of mpliments on these shoes, so I was happy.Perfect lor.I liked it very much even though the purple was more like a lilac.They are beautiful-the blue is deep and just the right shadeI like the shirt and all but..... it's not the dark royal blue lor advertised.It's more of a faded blue, still a great shirt though.I have no problem with it it fits very nicely Will love to have different lorsThere are silver now.Otherwise, good, solid lorsPerfect lor too, I have the navy.I received mine in the wrong lor but they still look very nice.i like the lors and the design but bigger then i expected and leaves a lot of lint on other clothingThe green lor's beautiful and it is soft.The lor is beautifulIt is a lovely gray-blue teal, light and uplifting or cheery, and sweet, not at all drab.I also purchased the green floral and the white with red/blue waterlor flowers.I was expected a black skirt but its navy, I'm ok with that.LOVE the hot pinkLove the lor and styleSo if you are looking for an orchid lored fascinator of the violet/orchid/amethyst/lavender hues, this is the fascinator for youThe lor is brilliant.I love the green lor.The lor was just as pictured very thick and warm.There over all super mfy, but i didn't

all the time.I absolutely loved the lor hi-liter yellow) of these leggings.very pretty, lorful dress.I love the shape the lorColor was great,I still ordered another one because the manufacturer has a beautiful dark green.The lor of this dress was supposed to be aqua."It is more green than aqua, but still a lovely dress.Gorgeous lors.Love the lor, sparkle and size.I'm thinking about buying more in different lorsGot the powdered pink and it was still see through.Not quite as dark as pictured but nice ntrasting ol tones.The lor is oat lored, not quite as light in the picture.The lor is very attractive and should mplement most skin tones.I love the lors, its as pictured.The lor is beautiful and it is very flattering.The reason for stars is because I think that the lor is off in it's description...They will be a perfect match with the school uniform.only lor hubby will wearThey are form-fitting pants great lorThe blouse that I received is a pewter lor.The lor is okay, but not a true blue.The loring is a little off I ordered the grey and it has a lavender tint to it.Nice case, some of pills in the case weren't lored /I do like the ring, and the pink lor is not too pale at all, just not as bold as the picture shows.These are a bit darker than the stock lenses but that's fine with me.It's the lor of Pepto Bismol.I just wish Amazon had it in more lors.Seems to be sold out in every lor/size.Nice top for the price, lors are beautiful.I ordered the set of , which specifies blue, pink, white and red.I received blue, pink, white, and camo.I wanted red, not camo.It's well made and the lors are vibrant.I really wanted it in blue, but the green worked out well.The lor is beautiful and it looks great with tights and a belt.Love the bracelet got lLooks more green than blue is reason for stars.I ordered more in different lors, I wish they were a bit longer for taller ladiesColor is accurate to the photo the mpany provided it looks a little blue in my photo but it is closer to a Tiffany green in person) But it is a bold, modern design so it won't go with every outfit.Overall I can see myself using this a lot, and would like to buy the other lors too.Otherwise it's a But is a beautiful dark blue and cute large blouselove the lor but it is alittle tight.Preferred beige but the pink is ok good for spring summerI ordered light purple and got pink.Other than the lor discrepancy, the dress is lovely and a perfect fit.Will be ordering more in different lorsI got the red wine lor and it is very nice.Lived the lor.I love the lor purple).The lor of this dress is so

like animal and better lor looking.In certain lights we'd swear it was navy blue.Colors are as shown..For now I will just keep trying to find the right lor purple.Good .but i think is dark blue not grayIs nice and a nice lorI wish the lors of the letter were red and black instead of red and grayI bought it in two lors charal and navy).These are super cute and made well enough for the price paid, I wish they had other lors/patterns.For the rerd - I bought pairs of pink, brown, white.First of all I love these pants so much that I bought a send pair in green.The lor, and design all works perfectly.I have this dress in blue and red.I'd give it a , but the stripy green ones are definitely not as advertised in the set I got.Will probably buy another lor.I wish they offered more lors besides just white.The lor is definitely a true red and the quality is exceptionally well for the price.lor leans more toward grayish blue as opposed to clear blue.We had to buy some tiny black rubber bands, though, because the neon lors they sent weren't to his taste.The lour of this two piece is a lovely dark blue, although it doesn't appear as dark as the photos.The lor is a regular red.Very good product the balls stay on and I love the lorsThe lor is not exactly as pictured.Not a vibrant red.The lor and look of this owl is very rich.True to lor pictured a good neutral cream.I bought the two pack of beige and teal, and one by itself in gray.The gray one had a less fuzzy suede tag C.C) in a reddish brown lor the tag on the teal and beige one is much softer and in my opinion a nicer shade of brown.These were really great and the lors are nice and bright.I purchased this lor and love it.I use a salt water pool and the royal blue has faded to nearly white on panels.I'll probably get another one in a different lorI never buy yellow but decided to with this one and it is already one of my favorites.I will give as a gift and order all the lors in xsColors are pretty.Bright lors w cute ruffle and matches the iplay pink well.A little big, but still nice, especially with a darker top, as it shows up more :Want a pair in every lor.Love this lor and the cap is niceThis cap is not exactly the same as the black.Will order other lors.the lor i received is more of a pink ral not a dusty pink as shown.The bottom print is very very pretty and everyone mplimented her on the print.The lors on this are beautiful and the dress is sooo mfortable.We love the lors because you can match it with so many outfits.We love them and have purchased more lors.The amber tint, ample polarization and wide lenses make these fantastic shades for the beachThey really brouht out the beautiful greens and aquas in the Gulf of Mexi without altering all of the other beachy lors.Loved the lor n

little lighter than pictureReally pretty I love the burnt sienna lor.Perfect lorsI absolutely love the green lor and the material is fantastic.Exactly as shownI noticed it was cheaper to order two than just one so I got the black and purple set.The lor is similar, if not darker, than freshly poured cement.It's more of a peachy lor than the pink the pucture showsother lors were fine.I bought the gold lor model its beautifull, i love it brings to chains one long and one shorter.Wish they had more lorsThe pink was a bit much for my husbandTwo mpartments which are nice Love the lor Kind of slow shippingIt is actually more of an orange lor.Wish they came in more lorsLike the lors a bit too big for me but over all goodColors are beautiful and fit is super flattering.I got them as a gift and she already had the blouse which was very white and not a match for the lor of the blouse at all.I have this in black and am ordering the blue today.Picture is accurate as to lor.i liked this but trying to find the lor for the pants no can doNote: lor fades faster than I had hoped, doesn't hold up well in chlorinated pools.Yes I would purchase again in another lorx will work good for this giant Scandinavian.Nice shape, uld be darker but works.I see lor ming off my beautiful purse because I was not informed at time of purchase.I ordered the charal, white, and black.I returned the black because of the holes but the charal and white are greatColor is more crimson than maroon.I had purchased for an event at Texas A&M and the lor wasn't maroon enough.I love the neon greenish stume.I gave it four stars because I'm a brat and wanted the white lor.The lour was not quite the same as the pictures on Amazon.The lour is gorgeous but more like ral or salmon.Haven't worn it yet, but did try it on.Very muted and most of the lors blend together.Nice lor Not sure why it says purple it is pink.The quality matches the price and the lor is true to the picture - a pearly white with vibrant lors.Nice rich red lor, not tomato red, not raspberry, a true red" if you will.I bought this dress in red and it's absolutely gorgeousI purchased them to use as undershirts for light lored shirts.Good

would be ideal if it had a zipper or flap closure with an outside pocket.Very nice And lor also will def be a attention grabberThe only thing is that the beads are green and not brown as I had hoped.Super cute and classic in blackWhich I like but if you want red this is not red.I got it in burgundy, really an eye catcher.I thought this was more turquoise, but it is more of a green.The only reason I returned it was this light blue" is more sea-foam green and did not match the pants I bought at all.Another note: I ordered the skirt in the army green lor and it matched the picture.I Really like the lors and feel.The lor is beAutiful and its mfortable to wear.They're bright greenI got the blue lor and it has variation that I didn't see on the pictures but it look nice and the lor is pretty.The lor is more like a tiffany blue than what is pictured.The top is a tad too tight, but the lor is beautifulI purchased the S in black.Otherwise they are more masculine than they appear in the photos but overall a good buy.Chain is a brassy gold lor.Perfect size, style and lor.I bought this dress in the spring in black.I would like to order different lors, but am a bit afraid of ruining more sheetsI was very happy that the shirt fit perfectly and went great with my mustard lor yellow skirt.Together with a pair of black Steve Madden pumps.Now that I got it, I wish I would have bought it in black, don't really like the reddish lor.Also like the lor it's very cheerful especially when it's raining.They are cute and green which is my favorite lor.The patterns add a beautiful touch to an otherwise simple design that elevates it, and the lor is gorgeous.These earrings are a very pretty dark blue/green zirn.Great lor just the right sizeI thing it's cute for the price point .. Good lor of red looks a little dressy but you can wear with jeans and dress up your outfit.My only mplaint is that the picture isn't representative of the actual lors.Other than it not being the exact lors I anticipated, it is a nice looking scarf.Just as picturesThe lor is more on the light green, think green apple.I also love the bright summery lor- and have gotten many mpliments.The lor was very

lors aren't as rich as pictured here.The lor is weird but still good.lors are a little off.. but still beautifulI still would prefer to be in a large than a medium, but I wanted to order with Amazon

labeled, black ".They are a much lighter jade green.eyes are very gold, I thought black.Very nice and loved the lor.COLOR: dress is white.I returned because I needed a white pair of sandals and not

great lors, great lasting, great fitI received a sapphire blue lor, which is what I was expecting from the picture.Her schools lors are navy and white.I must note that the yellow in the feather is really bright think highlighter yellow lol).Soft and the lors so far have help up alright.My only mplaint is that the lor pink is more like peach or ral and not really pinky but overall I'm happy with my purchase.The lor was true to the picture.The lor of the logo isn't exactly what I had hoped but for the price it is a nice shirt.The lor is also more of a dark gray than black.Other than the fit was perfect and I really like the pretty deep red lor.It is a beautiful lor, fabric and great for the summerLike it but lors off.The lors are not as bright as in the picture.I like how it's lorful~ Give a bit of life to a plain lored skirt.I love the print and it's super brights and cuteI ordered it in red and it feels good and looks good too, with lots of room, even for my cell phone.The vivid lors didn't hold up % in the wash not all the car prints, looks very lived in quickly but I still like it a lot.I got mine in black, and the lor is just as expected.Just as the photo.And it's the blue one.However, the blue is a darker lor and appears to be more royal blue than sky blue.I'm not mplaining about the lor swap however because this blue is much more appealing in my opinion.I'll add a pic so you can see the lor better.The grey lor is greatvery happy full floppy and really close to the feel of real fur ball which I own in various lors just not that beautiful rnflower blue lorBought of these also got the lorful one too.Attractive scarf, but the lor is not what is pictured.Still a really nice scarf and I may buy other lors.It's a beautiful lor blue also.I love the dark blue and cutNot the lor of sequin on the top as in the picture, it was a bronze lor and wasn't what I was looking for.I got it in pink and I think I am going to get the green as wellI got the flower/bird pattern.They turned all differant lors and also had a strope option on there tooShe loves that they change lor in the sunlight.I may order another lor.Nice material and GREAT lors.White is nice bright white.They aren't as dark as id hoped but overall a good buy.the blue is not as dark as the picture, but still nice and i would nsider it to be a masculine blue.We have both the whimsical and the nautical styles, and I will say that the ones with solid loring have held up much better than the ones with the white backgrounds.Arrived on time love the lor.I have these in all my shoes now.I like it enough, I'm going to buy a send one in a different lor.Love all the lor options as well.This dress was not the same lor shown in the picture ad.They navy, turquoise, and striped.I love the style and lors of this dress.I got the black and it's very flattering.I'm definitely thinking about buying more in different lorsVery happy that we got a few gloves in every lor.Overall good pants for the price with a nice design and fun lors.Looks good and o love the lorsOverall cute swimsuit.I love the look, feel, lor, and overall style of this bag.The white lor was not my favorite, but I ordered other lors that look better such as the blue and the pink.Again both lors very pretty and sexyThe lor is truly stunning.The goggles are blue instead of silver/grey and the minion was more of a dark, mustard yellow than a bright yellow.Perfect lor great quality.Exactly as described, the lor as well.Great lor intensity, looks just like the photo provided.The lor was just a vibrant as advertised, which is why I bought it.Color was just as expected.With yellow I was worried about the lor since I wanted it to be a bright yellow but not on the neon green side.I would have like to see a better representation of the lor.It is a gorgeous grey, just like the pictureThis is a unique print.So I bought some more in other lorsI purchased in all three lors.Beautiful lor, runs somewhat small.Cute but hat is lighter lor.Really ol, lor is a bit more grey than the picture.Love the olive lorMore like anavy blue which is perfect for me.I wish it came in a few other basic lors.I like this item, the lor red mes like it shows and its very nvenient.The lor was very vibrant and eye-catching I got the fuchsia).Not as vibrant lor as the picture.The dark lor is more of a brownish red lor.The only issue I have is the lors as it looks to much like MichiganI love this bag, which it came in an other lor as well, for summer.Deep purple lor is as shown.I love the cream and red which is actually maroon) lors and they are very soft and light weight.The lor was not quite as pictured, they a little brighter and more aqua... they are also not as sheer.The print is vibrant and as picturedI love all the lors and the tassels.It is a great product and I am looking to get one in grey ..soon Kevin B TCI ProvoI bought a few in different lors.I will order the same brand but the /.The red is perfect with jeans.I liked them but they sent me a pair that had been used.I originally got this top, in another lor, from a different seller, and the fit was perfect.So be warned that the lor isn't quite as cutesy and pastel like the images, but overall I am pleased with the product.It's the the lor I was expecting.It says it's a light pink lor.But I got a bright pink lor instead.Like this because the lor is neutral so matches with all swimwear.Nice design, bright lors.I purchased the pper lor - it was exactly as shown and very pretty.I am impressed with the wide range of lors available just waiting for the weather to get a bit oler before heading into the fleece pair.Awesome print and super mfy.The lor is not as bright as seen in the photo, but it is still a beautiful shawl.I was satisfied, the dress is beautiful, the yellow was shine.Great price and love the lorI also wish it came in more lors.No real left or right though, for those who ncern themselves with such.Love the lor and material.Its a beautiful lor.I like the lors of it a lot.The lors are bright, and the design is attractive.Different lor than most of my earrings, so they are unique to me.Nonetheless, I ordered the tan with gold H. Looks like the real deal.Very nice lors and mfortable.I bought pink and red.I got the dark blue and it is not see-through at all just saying because I read some reviews about this as a problem.Lots of lor choices, I already ordered anotherThey look decent, are easy to put on no laces seems mfortable, and have multiple lighting options on/off, interganging lors, solid lor, blinking lor).Colors were bright, but a bit off olor.The part that should be turquoise is light blue.Colors where just as appeared.Interestingly it was the red and yellow pair in both orders.Comfortable, beautiful lorLove the lors of the blue ones.I chose the red but it looks more like a deep blood red shade.It is bold and beautiful just as the top is.I love these headbands and have them in mutiple lors.This is really mfy and the lor is exactly what I expected.I may need to get more styles/lors.The light blue is really more greenish teal.I decided on this one because first I love the lor and the yellow is bright making it easy to find in even the deepest purse.Nice bag, beautiful lor.Would be great if the sizing was nsistent for all lors/hats.Great lors and fitOverall its a great lor and fit.The are the right lor.Sheer, but Love the fun patterns and lors, fit pretty well.I ordered the brown, and while it looks like an olive lor in the photo, it is definitely a light brown material instead.Perfect lorI purchased a black one the first time and lost it.This time I got a beautiful blue and a taupe which came as ok.Color is burnt orange, preferable personally.Overall, super cute hat and I do love it.Just the lor is not how I expected.This is more likely royal blue than navy.The lors are as pictured.Slightly large love the lorEither way they look great and the lors are awesomeLook great too, love the gray lor.The lights are bright white.Will purchase other lors.the design is nice, although orange on burgundy is not my first choice, it looks just fine.Only mplaint would be the pattern seems somewhat muted mpared with the lor of the shirt Heather blue)The lor is amazingThe wine red is a beautiful lor.The lens lor is going to be the lor of everything you see so be sure you like it.Great lors and material.BEAUTIFULLI will say that the green is not a darker green as it appears in the photo it's more of an olive green, but it is still beautiful.It's a nice jacket but the lors aren't near as bright as they appear in the picture.They are VERY dark shades.I'm pleased with my purchases would & may) order in another lor.The purple ones came way darker than expected, so it's hard to tell that they aren't black if you're not in really good lighting.The only thing I don't love is that the background picture is a little darkI originally ordered it in a beige lor but actually am returning this for black instead, because I feel that in a light lor the pencil shape is just a little too hip-hugging and revealing.The vibrant lors are amazing, and makes it possible to match it with anything.After receiving a different dress from the one I purchased they sent me the rrect one and it is lovely.The picture doesn't give the true lor--silver and black.The lor was true and it definitely matched the minion yellowOverall happy and love the Heather green lor.The earrings were a gift for my fiance..his birthstone lor.They are true in lor...they are very nice earrings for the priceThe Inside Out characters are prominently displayed, which is good because they hide the random car and rocket in the background...I will check out everything that has purple in it as a possible stume accent.While the lor is black, the material has some other lors infused in it, giving it more of a metallic look.love the burgundy lor with my grey hair.No where near as lorful as the photo pictured, but <sigh> it serves its purpose well.:) It's pretty and I love the lors.Great lor also, good purchase.Color was as pictured on Amazon also.I thought this would go well with my daughter's turquoise bathing suit, but the gray is darker, and doesn't look fresh and light like the picture at all.Love the size and lor and just about everything.Bright lor very mfy as a women who is top heavy I worry about buying shirts on line but this fit good.Red is beautiful.I bought the navy blue.Overall a super cute shirtThey are a deep red in person and don't have an orange tint like they do in the photos.I still like them and they're perfect for my Black splay beautiful lor as expectedLovely lor I love these pants in purple and just order them in other lors.I liked the plaid pattern shown, but the pattern I received is more of a checkered/gingham black and blue shirt.I love the design, its true to the picture the pink is bright) but it seems like it runs small.I just wish they had the lor I wanted.Very vibrant lor.I like to wear mesh shirts under many pieces and was looking for the three basic lors: white, nude and black.She always loves them, but would like some solid lors to be available.I am going to look for a beige lored tank like the girl in the photo and I think that'll work fineBut over all love the style and the lor grey)Color is not my personal favorite though.I am returning it as I wanted grey but I will nsider the other lors and would order again.The navy is a true navy lor.very good fabric, and awesome irish green lorWasn't exactly the right lor but love it anywaysThe lor is more off-white/ivory than white.Yes, the lor is lighter on the front and vibrant on the back, but it doesn't bother me and looks just fine.Anyway, they look pretty ol with two different patterns being worn at a time.The lors are bright like I'd hoped for.Bold lors but very fun, nice fit.The only thing is that I ordered the pack, black and charal.The purple is a very pretty plum purple and the shipping is much faster than I expected, received it in only about daysBought another in black, I loved it so muchThis is a very pretty ringI really like the beanies because they're a great fit ) The lors I got were black, black, grey, bright red, burgundy, and Royal blue.It looks good but the lor is a bit off, not what we expected at all.These are not pink, more of a muted red.The lors are bright and bold.Pros: lors are vibrantI bought three lors and stack it with blazers.Have the lors available and wish they came in more feminine lors.Very nice, a little too big but nice, beautiful lornot all the lors shown in the picture are not what you receive.the lors that are shown and that you receive will be much more transparent I received the following lors: black, white, like green, blue, pink, red, yellow, orange, and violet.Great tunic and very nice lor.I have them in black and gray and love themVery happy with lorsBut, other than that, they are good quality and the turquoise lor is bright and beautifulLunar Rock is not lor pictured...it is definitely grayI am sending it back for the Esther lor and will update on that lor.Mine retained its bright lors.Very cute, love the blue lor.The lors are very pretty.Beautiful, bright lors.The Black lor is not black, it's navy with pink, blues and yellows.It's a nice shirt I love the lor but unless you have a bra that goes with that design everything will show on the sides.Color runs like crazy, so be careful not to mixed with light lors.The blue is so pretty and it is so sparklyThe lors were great and matched tons on outfitsOverall I am very happy with this dress.Nice, not as dark in lor as I expected.The lor is nice and vibrant.The light blue is definitely more of a mint lor to me but it is incredibly soft.Colors where not as bold but it is still a nice skirt.Overall, the lor is very cute and material is good.Pretty lorThe lors and fit were as expected, and It came quickly in the mail.A very pretty shirt but needs a cami underneath it and the white but is really ivory.Good lor, just what my wife wanted.Great print and overall design.Will definitely get another in a different lor at some pointThey were nice and bold when I first got them.I got the purse with no leopard print.Very basic and simple all black.Due to the different tints, they are working like a charm for my night and day riding.Got lots of mpliments, and the lor of the pink in the pic is trueLots of lor options and alternating options.Lights are bright and lorful.The print is adorable, but please now the back is longer than the front, which I should have known when I purchased the shirt.Very pretty pattern and lors.I'm not crazy about the lours offered, but the sale price can't be beaten.All the lors are just as pictured.Wish they had more lors than black.The lors were bright and crisp.I like the lor and the material.I really like the dress and the lor is really pretty.Darker shade of silver.The writing is more orange and the white is more gray.The lors are too good.She loves the pattern.More of a dark grey.It's a great lor too and I love these so kept them.Beautiful lors and length is perfect.Color pretty.Cute pattern.The lors are my favoriteOverall, it's cute.But I would say this one is much better than the green striped with the same pattern.present for a friend, lors looked a bit different when it got here but they loved it so i guess its fineyes, in a different lor.The quality is very nice, the lor true to the picture.Just have ti be careful what I wear underneathRed lor is darker red than pictured, not a bright Christmas red I wanted.I'll order other lors tooThe lettering style is really nice.They are bright orange.Color was a little different than I expected but it fit good and is very mfortable.Have two other lorsProbably will get more in future different lors.This really was a beautiful lor and dress though.Love the look of these, was a bit worried when ordering that the

plentyLoved the lorsThis bikini is so vibrant and looks exactly like the photo.Pros: The bright lors.Also, the beige lor has a distinct peachy/light orange tint.NOT a neutral shade but a warm shade.I bought this in three lors and only kept one.Red with a flower print.The print is not centered, which wasn't a big ncern for me.I must say the lours are more vibrant than the pictureNice brilliant red.I ordered the light blue one since I don't have anything in that lor, so beautiful like a sky blueThe pink one is adorable.The teal lor is true to the picture and as with any Asian clothing, definitely order up in sizing.Very Bright The lor was exactly like the one in the picture, I love the fabric and all... just, the straps are very long so I had to get them tailored.Mine came with a lighter brown lor, much lighter than what shown on website.Loved the print.Wonderful lor and weight.I absolutely love the lor, the look and the capacity of both the " upright and the dowel.I got the mint lor and it is lovely.I was hoping the print would be more vibrant I bought it in both black and gray.Loved the pattern.Just dragons aren't very distinctive.I got black and purple.Not into

this bodysuit in the lor white, and I am very pleasedOverall though, I absolutely love this shirt.I ordered these before I found a purple set that I liked also.The lor is really pretty too.Perfect greenThe lor is true to the picture I ordered red for splay.)I love the lor and the fur keeps you warm.It is very short but that's okay because it is meant to be worn over a swimsuit at the beach or lake.The lor is vibrant too which is fun for the summer time.Wish you had other lorsNice lor, but too large and long.All in all, they are great for what we need and the lors work for just about any outfit.First I would like to say my hoodie didn't have hoodie strings and is wine red, not the bright red you see pictured.Cons: the lor isn't as bright of an orange.It is more like a warm orange".The orange lor is VERY bright.Otherwise, as I said it is a very attractive cap with symbols of man and man and woman and woman dancing happily together.Actually it is more red than garnet or ruby lored but that's ok.However, I would like the stones to be more garnet dark red.they are a gift but look awesome, love the lor.The lour is true to what is displayed.Hopefully that will work because the purple lor is just what we were looking for.The lor and style was better than expected.The lors are vibrant and gorgeousI am sad to return it, as it looks beautiful otherwise.Loved the style but at the time I really was looking for a hunter green lor dress and ordered this one to try in case I didn't like the other green dress I bought.This may work for you...hence four starsUnique and nice lor.Now, two of the big letters on the back didn't have perfect edges, i.e I uld tell there had been problems with the application.In fact, I plan to get the white and red sets as well.I purchased two of these shirts in different lors.The invoice says ivory, yet it is not the lor I need for my wedding.Either way, I like the lor the way it isI wish there was more lors in this shirt.The lor of the design was not as vibrant as pictured.You will need a nude/white bra or a white tank top to wear with it for the top is see through with brighter lors.Very true to the lor shown.Live the lor.So light too.The grey lor is also nice )Mine was much more blue than the green stone pictured.wasn't exactly the lor I ordered.The shirt was beautiful and lovely, very bright nice lors.In the pictures, it is the only clicker that is silver in lor.Sure enough, it got here overnight and was- a yellow gold.I'm keeping it to add diversity to my llection, but would have gotten the white or blue opal if I had known they were all yellow gold lored.Vibrant lors, and fit just right.This skirt arrived quickly and the lor was exactly as I hoped it would be.I'll probably buy more in different lors.wish the lors were more vibrant and ttonThe lor is bright and summery.I would buy it again and get it in the other lors.Nice quality, vibrant lor.The dress was much longer on me then expected and the green lor was very Kelly Green" and did not look great on my mplexion.The burgundy I purchased is a nice, rich hue.Great lor very bright and vibrant.It's not the lor it shows.Has brown in it.like the lorsLovely lor.Beautiful lor and dress Used a permanent marker to lor it in.The print is gorgeousThe skirt we purchased features Alice in Wonderland in a waterlor-like print.Beautiful dress) nice silhouette,

hearts, skulls, tribal aztec and a lorful button print.I purchased the teal and burgundy set.Would have preferred a lighter lor but overall great lookI bought this top in several lors.I got the beige lor and it's not see through at all.Wish the lors were more earth tones.I love the lor and the saying, I'm a very slow runner so I'm excited to have a fun shirtI will definitely be purchasing another lor in this.The only mplaint is its a lot lighter of blue then the picture but other then that super super small details I absolutely LOVE ITThe lors are beautifulI got this hat to get a little more lor variety to the two Epoch ivy caps that I had.It is actually better then in the picture.I like them and I'll be ordering more lors.LOVED THE COLOR.Loved it the st time but lor fades fastA bit more purple-ish than plumAttractive lor Got it in pink and the lor looked nice, not as pink online, more muted in lor.Love the lors an the amount great price.These are identical to the photo.Not exactly white.I bought the magenta.It's more of a cholate brown with a rosy undertone, very pretty.I wish these would have been the right shade of brown for the shoe I wanted to use them inThe lor is a little lighter shade of burgundy than i was expecting but it wasn't salmon" or anything like that.The top is a purple lor not a royal blue, but it's still cute and soft so I'll keep it.It is very full and a nice lor of grayDoesn't glow as bright as I thought but was pretty.I got the wrong print but ended up liking it so much I kept it anyway.Color is true to picture.I ordered the wine lored shirt.I like it with a white tee underneath, which enhances the lors beautifullyGood lor yet after washing. lors.I ordered this in white and it is pretty see through.I stitched it closed myself, but that's the reason why I didn't give this top four stars.They are HOT PINK otherwise adorableThe necklace is a great lor yellow and is very bright.lors were great but a little on the big side and the material was sheer so I have to wear something under itAssorted lors.Like everything except the lor, more orange than I expected.I ordered / lors and they are nearly perfect.I ordered the teal and black one and the lor was true to the picture shown.First, I got the maroon or and I LOVE that faded maroonThe suit was really nice in lors and the pattern was what I expected like the picture.Love the lor Khaki lor is too yellow.Love the design and lorCute for SFI am getting a lot of mpliments on the green lor that I chose.The material is great and the lor is just too cute to resist.Like the hat but one reason I bought it, aside from the blue lor, was that it stated it was made in the USA.So buy it for the lor, or the style, but don't buy it because it was made in the USA because it wasn't.It was more of a Barney or kiddie" purple and I did not feel the lor was age appropriate for me lol.Would buy again if I was sure to receive the right lor...Just know going in that this is % beige and definitely not close to white.I wish this came in Navy, but this lor will work.Orange should have been darker.vibrant lorsI love the white and the blue lor.(First Review: It's blue, brown, and grey and does not have the design that is shown.)Very bright lor, super cute with a cardigan.These earrings are a very pretty shade of red.Purchased two more lors when I got home but the material feels different, fit the same, hope they will do as great as this.I love the lors of this blouse they are true to the picture.I sent them back twice because the white is not a true white.First I orders pearlized white and they were more a cream, then order just white and they were the exact same as the pearlized.I have one just like the photo, only mine is blue and I like the ntrast.The variety and lors you get are nice especially for the price.The lor in pix appears as a pale pink but is a bright pink.The lor is emerald green, not as pictured.The lors have not yet faded but I have not wash the swimsuit, only let it air dry after a vacation.The lors are very true to the picture and are very bright.I just wish there were more lors.They are truly polarized.I don't think the sodalite lored ones look as good in real life as they do in the product picture but overall I think all three of them are worth the price.Print's nice but definitely looks better in the picture.This particular size and print for whatever reason was only , so I'm deliriously happy about this purchase.I like the style and the lors.Colors are bright pretty.Would buy again in different lor.Very cute and lighter pink than pictured.I just thought the flowers were so pretty, but we wound up using the white more.After the send wearing, I purchased another one in a different lor.I still love it though but was hoping for whiteBeautiful red lor.Lots of different designs and lors.I ordered the pink lor, it's a nice soft pink lor, now I need the khaki lor, I need every lor.The lors, in person, are as vivid as the product image.Mother is very pleased and loves that it is purple.Overall love them a lotLove the lor and they fit perfectlyRegardless I love these and hope to have every lor.I purchased this dress in lors.Easy to find bright pink in my backpack pockets.Wish there were more lorsI got the white black.Mixed stone lors of red and a red orange lor that is not true red but not orange more like the lor of fire.The lor and design is amazing.Very soft and sexy I love the lor and the style.I paired then with another shirt of the same brand and the lors matched exactly.It's lorful without being too bright and the classic style will ordinate well with my other D&B handbags.I got that yellow and it is a very vibrant yellow.I wish there were solid lors, I'd order more of them.I will be ordering in other lors.The designs are just like what is shown in the picture, with three different lor tank tops.They are pink, white, and a greenish-blue.The lor is super vibrant, and the cut of the piece shows off your curves.These earrings are quite lovely and my favorite lor is red.I bought another brand that was more expensive but this is the one I will buy many lors inThe lor was awesome, it was light weight and flowy.I will have to try the other lors too.Adorable, well made, great lor.I have these in almost every lor and wear them under everything.The lors are vibrant and the stitching is strong.I am going to see if there are other lors.I am very happy with this style and have already ordered it in each lor available.Color is as shown, a royal blue.The blue lor is gorgeous and it will look great over a sweater with jeans or leggings.Just as ordered and lor was exactly what was pictured.My son loves this belt very nice lorThey Came Fast So Many Different Colors So Many Of Them Worth More

screen settings.Color is great tooIt's a deep red wine lor not as bright as it appears in the picture.They are great lors, very bright which makes them easy to find in the snow.Liked them so much I bought them in two lors.Bright in lor well made I get alot of mplimentsWish they had more lors.Love this mouse pad...the lors match my butterflies in my living roomColors exactly as pictured, choker

thought he wanted a brown one, i immediately ordered it.I went and ordered black, pink and blue.It is much more of a brighter cherry red than the wine red shown in the picture.I love them and will get another pairThe lor is really nice and it feels very sturdy.The lor is great and it's a great thickness to it.The lor is not a true rose gold lor, it looks more gold to me, but it is beautiful

information for the purse.But the lor is darker than I expected and it came super fastI love this for the beach to avoid those crazy tan lines.Might buy another lor.The lor is a nice dark purplish maroon.Love the different lors.This is one to have in every single lorAlso the navy bag is true to the lor as shown in its picture.I was worried that the lor and size might not me as ordered because
