115,44047,I had to sew that one closed.,44047,3,-1

122,44048,"It definitely arrived quickly, that's true.",44048,3,0
123,44048,But it was way too small for my any of my fingers except my pinky which I'm not too thrilled about and the actual engraving on the ring wasn't that great either.,44048,3,1
124,44048,Sadly I judt wasted my money.,44048,3,-1

133,44052,The socks have a slight roll at the top.,44052,3,3

137,44053,Clothes I've ordered so far don't be the actual size.,44053,3,1
138,44054,"I thought the chain was going to be a little more delicate and it tangles very easily, but other than that i love it!",44054,3,3
139,44054,Also love the little infinity bracelet I received as well!,44054,3,-1
140,44055,Definitely not made for anyone with breasts.,44055,3,1
141,44055,"The plaid pattern is hard to imagine under any dress like a slip, but the entire thing is sheer, so... Not really sure how it's meant to be worn.",44055,3,-1
142,44055,"Too bad though,  it's very cute.",44055,3,-1
143,44056,alot bigger than expexted,44056,3,1
144,44057,They appear much larger than in person.,44057,3,1
145,44058,"But the collar bone was on my chest, the knees were on my thighs, and the legs stopped on my calf.",44058,3,1
146,44058,It worked and it didn't cost much.,44058,3,-1
147,44059,The pendant was fine but the chain is cheaply made and broke a few days after my 9 year old wore it.,44059,3,3
148,44060,shoe is extremely wide.,44060,3,1
149,44061,Bigger in person than I imagined...not good earrings for talking on the phone,44061,3,1
150,44062,I order the color Lace 2 it  was exactly as described on amazon.,44062,3,2
151,44062,I am 5ft 5 about 125 lbs and the small fit nicely with room to spare.,44062,3,1
152,44062,"Very pretty floral lace design lightweight, soft, and comfortable.",44062,3,3
153,44062,"It is gorgeous, but not for me.",44062,3,-1
154,44062,The sleeves are about three-quarter length sleeves.,44062,3,1
155,44062,The material is made out of chiffon which is lightweight and breathable material works well as a beach cover up or as a regular cardigan to protect your skin from the sun.,44062,3,3
156,44062,It can be easily dressed up or down.,44062,3,-1
157,44062,It looks like it is made of high-quality material and the lace detail is very pretty.,44062,3,3
158,44062,"The only complaint is it had a strong weird smell, like dirt or dust my allergies started acting up it caused me to sneeze a lot, but that is just me I have a very sensitive nose.",44062,3,3
159,44062,"I aired it out a bit it helped, but not much I guess you could also wash it.",44062,3,-1
160,44062,According to wash and care instructions you can hand wash it.,44062,3,-1

162,44064,fits well & looks good.,44064,3,1
163,44064,"However the first time I wore it I was at work when I discovered that on of the seams along the side in the hip area had not been properly sewn and there way about a 2"" hole there.",44064,3,3
164,44064,"It will be an easy fix, but it's not what you expect from something brand new.",44064,3,-1
165,44064,And definitely not what you want to discover while at work.,44064,3,-1
166,44065,Retired it because it was too large.,44065,3,1
167,44066,Omg It doesn't have a lot of Slots this wallet is Perfect on everything but so few slots for id and cards,44066,3,-1
168,44067,The top of this dress does not match the bottom in terms of sizing.,44067,3,1
169,44067,I bought a medium dress and when I put it on the bust area was more of an extra large and the bottom area near a small.,44067,3,1
170,44067,Good quality material though.,44067,3,3
171,44067,I'll keep it and just have the top altered.,44067,3,-1
172,44068,The case is a bit too bulky but it is one of a few that can fit 100mm cigarettes.,44068,3,1
173,44068,It can also hold 2 lighters (one on each side).,44068,3,-1
174,44068,"It is made in China and quality is not the best, but it is quite decent.",44068,3,3
175,44069,"I'm 5'9'', thin to average weight, depending on the brand I can buy jeans size 29 through 32, 31 being the size I get most often and that's the size I ordered for these jeans.",44069,3,1
176,44069,"They fit perfectly, but they are certainly not slim fit or even ""stylish"" (pictures attached).",44069,3,1
177,44069,"The cut is rather straight, I'd say, especially when compared to other slim fit jeans made in Asia that I've gotten through Amazon.",44069,3,-1
178,44069,"They seem to be quite durable, so $20 is a good price for a pair of jeans, it's just not really what I expected regarding how they look.",44069,3,3
179,44070,Stones too large and ring spins so the back side of the ring is always in front.,44070,3,3
180,44070,Decided what I was looking for was a full eternity band to eliminate this problem.,44070,3,-1
181,44071,"Half of the socks fit great, but the other half were way too big.",44071,3,1
182,44071,"It was a set of eight, and I can only wear four of them comfortably.",44071,3,1
183,44071,If they were all the correct size I would have rated higher.,44071,3,1
184,44072,not as attractive on as appears in picture,44072,3,2
185,44073,Be prepared for shreds of material to come out of robe.,44073,3,3
186,44073,"Of course, I washed it before giving it to my grandson but not before shreds of the robe were all over the bedspread where I opened the package.",44073,3,3
187,44074,Very cute top but very very small.,44074,3,1
188,44074,I ordered a large & it fits like a small.,44074,3,1
189,44074,Good price so I will give it to a friend rather than return it.,44074,3,-1
190,44075,"Good design

I prefer the boxer brief style

14% spandex turns out to be more form fitting than I like in a pair of underwear",44075,3,-1
191,44076,The fabric is a little thin for my taste but I would expect it to be cool to wear in warmer weather.,44076,3,3
192,44076,This style is definitely for taller silhouettes.,44076,3,1
193,44076,"I'm 4'10"" and it didn't look great on me, almost clownish, so I returned it and received a full refund.",44076,3,1
194,44076,I'm sure others may find the style flattering and very comfortable.,44076,3,-1
195,44076,Seller is very good and responsive.,44076,3,-1
196,44077,"Very soft, durable and has a laptop sleeve BUT unlike my other backpack with a laptop sleeve, this one is not protected at all.",44077,3,3
197,44077,There's no hardboard backing to the back of this bag so be very careful when you put your laptop in.,44077,3,-1
198,44077,I had to put a legal notepad in the laptop sleeve JUST to give it structure.,44077,3,-1
199,44077,Just be careful of that if you do intend to use this mostly for laptop carrying.,44077,3,-1
200,44077,I use this for grocery-shopping when I need to be on a bike.,44077,3,-1
201,44077,Oh and the strap - at least my left one: CONTINUOUSLY loosens on its own.,44077,3,3
202,44077,The metal rectangle that holds it in place (where you tighten) keeps turning/rotating 90% so it loosens the entire strap and will NOT tighten.,44077,3,3
203,44077,I have to fix it almost 2 out of 3 times I use this bag (even briefly for 1-2 hours each time).,44077,3,3
204,44077,It's kind of annoying especially when you're on your bike weaving in and out of traffic.,44077,3,-1
205,44078,Very cute and still fits but very hard to get in and out of.,44078,3,1
206,44079,need to adjust all the time,44079,3,-1

209,44080,"They shipped a Large, but it fits fine) the only problem I have is the material.",44080,3,-1
210,44080,There is NO WAY this suit is any more than 5% polyester or spandex.,44080,3,3
211,44080,"The material is cheap, cheap, cheap.",44080,3,3
212,44080,It doesn't even feel like it would dry if wet.,44080,3,3

214,44080,"So, all in all, if you're only interested in buying this swimsuit for the looks, go for it.",44080,3,-1
215,44080,"But if you actually want to swim or get it wet, this is not the suit for you.",44080,3,-1
216,44081,it was flimsy and not as pretty,44081,3,3
217,44082,Nice leather but if you expect to fit your cards in there and be able to get them back out forget it.,44082,3,2
218,44082,The slots are very tight and after struggling to get my cards in it was impossible to get them out.,44082,3,-1
219,44082,"When you do get them in, the center part that should have been for cash (bills) can't be used because you can no longer push on the sides to open it up.",44082,3,-1
220,44083,Runs big should have got a smaller size.,44083,3,1
221,44083,Asides from that it was beautiful,44083,3,2
222,44084,It was not what I expected.,44084,3,2
223,44084,It photographs great but when I received it I found the material to be cheap.,44084,3,3
224,44084,I wasn't pleased and didn't wear it.,44084,3,-1
225,44084,I probably will but I wasn't impressed.,44084,3,-1
226,44085,But still a little tight in the top and bottom areas.,44085,3,1
227,44085,"Wish all over seas company's would understand that American women, most of them, come in large sizes.",44085,3,1
228,44085,Meaning a size 16 here is the same as their XXXLarge.in most cases.,44085,3,1
229,44085,"With all of the over seas Companies making each size different, its hard to figure out what size to order from them  In the USA,  a size 16 is what it says.",44085,3,1
230,44086,Not impressed w the fabric.,44086,3,3
231,44086,Too warm for the summer on a hot day.probably would look best on a very thin body as the dress is smaller than expected........,44086,3,3
232,44087,"This is differently something that people with bigger boobs don't need, they don't fit as well.",44087,3,1
233,44087,I got two of mine in but it was nice to have a spot for underware,44087,3,-1
234,44088,Looks like a nice enough shirt.,44088,3,-1
235,44088,Material is on the thin side.,44088,3,3
236,44088,But BEWARE: you may not get the style you ordered.,44088,3,2
237,44088,"I selected the navy blue shirt and received a navy blue and white striped shirt with a collar and a bear on the breast with the words ""little brother"".",44088,3,2
238,44088,It'll do but I'd really rather have just received the plain shirt I selected.,44088,3,2
239,44089,Very wrinkled and hand washing makes it even worse.,44089,3,3
240,44090,This dress fits great and easy to wear.,44090,3,1
241,44090,I'm a XL or a 12 and I purchased a xxl.,44090,3,1
242,44091,Nice piece of jewelry.,44091,3,-1
243,44091,"Hook gave trouble and had to be replaced but other than that, it's not bad",44091,3,3
244,44092,Ok gloves made by a small child... probably.,44092,3,1
245,44093,Just ok. Design true to picture.,44093,3,2
246,44093,But much bulkier than I thought.,44093,3,1
247,44094,"Well I knew I was pushing it with the sizing when I bought it, but my main issue was that it is neon, not emerald, and I was hoping for a deep Slytherin green.",44094,3,-1
248,44094,"Its a pretty enough bright green, but it also swishes when you move.",44094,3,2
249,44094,"And I cannot recommend this to a lady my size, I'm a size12-14, it fits but manages to flatten my butt, and does no similar feat for my stomach.",44094,3,1
250,44094,"The size range they list are absolute Maximums, any larger and it will compress you to that size, which looks pretty bad on me.",44094,3,1
251,44095,I purchased this shirt with high hopes because I have the perfect pair of shoes to coordinate.,44095,3,-1
252,44095,I was disappointed once I tried it on and it was wayyyyyyyyyy to tight.,44095,3,1
253,44095,"I used the sizing chart provided and even ordered a size up, no dice!",44095,3,1
254,44095,It was way to tight over the bust area and the arms seemed to be cut really small.,44095,3,1
255,44095,I would say if you are going to order this shirt order it 2 - 3 sizes bigger.,44095,3,1
256,44095,"I gave it three stars because other than the sizing issues the shirt was a beautiful color, the fabric was very lux, and the overall quality was good.",44095,3,-1
257,44095,I am kind of bummed that it didn't fit.,44095,3,1
258,44096,It was very pretty when I got it.,44096,3,-1
259,44096,I liked it because it had the adjustable chain on it.,44096,3,-1
260,44096,I bought it for my mother and she loved it too.,44096,3,-1
261,44096,It wound up breaking 4 days later.,44096,3,3
262,44097,It's beautiful but way too big !,44097,3,1
263,44097,Got a XL should of got m or L,44097,3,1
264,44099,"The style is cute  but it fits too small the size cut small  I  order the a extra large size I was Suprise  that it didn't  fit,the material  could be a  better quality,  I have returned  the dress back still waiting  for my refund",44099,3,-1
265,44100,Over the shirt looks exactly as advertised.,44100,3,-1
266,44100,"However, the material of the shirt feels like a raincoat.",44100,3,3
267,44101,This skirt is very pretty.,44101,3,-1
268,44101,The color is true to the image (I got the light pink).,44101,3,2
269,44101,But the waistline is a mess.,44101,3,3
270,44101,I mean it's so bad you need to find a way to cover it.,44101,3,3
271,44101,The elastic is all janky and lopsided.,44101,3,3
272,44101,It looks like a home-ec project done by a 12 year old.,44101,3,3
273,44101,Get a belt or something else that can cover it up.,44101,3,-1
274,44101,No self respecting adult would wear that waist band.,44101,3,3
275,44101,"I would give it 1 star, but it's so cheap I feel like this is a ""get what you pay for"" situation.",44101,3,3
276,44102,Not what the pic looks like,44102,3,2
277,44104,Items is great however it runs a lot larger than expected.,44104,3,1
278,44104,I reviewed numerous over reviews so I ordered a size down than what I typically would and it is still a bit big.,44104,3,1
279,44104,"However,  other than being a bit larger it looks good.",44104,3,1
280,44105,It's cute however the sides are high at the bottom of the shirt which means unless you want people to see your skin or tummy you have to wear some sort of tank under it.,44105,3,-1
281,44105,Not sure how that will be possible since its strapless.,44105,3,-1
282,44106,Its ok but because it's small I haveto keep pulling it down or it falls off my head.,44106,3,1
283,44106,It fits my teen daughter just fine tho.,44106,3,1
284,44107,It's just for give away.,44107,3,-1
285,44108,"It fits and looks just like the images, but it had a weird odor.",44108,3,-1
286,44108,Kinda Musty - I had to wash it and soak it in fabric softener to get rid of the smell.,44108,3,3
287,44109,"Very good material, but the dress old fashion style.",44109,3,3
288,44109,Not as sexy as it looks.,44109,3,-1
289,44110,a bit smaller than expected,44110,3,1
290,44111,I had to get a smaller size for my 4 yr old granddaughter.,44111,3,1
291,44111,I size 4 was too big.,44111,3,1
292,44112,"This costume is cute, but the one I received was not only small, but it was also all stuck together in the package.",44112,3,1
293,44112,When I pulled it apart the color where the skirt had stuck together was damaged.,44112,3,3
294,44114,okay for the price.,44114,3,-1
295,44115,About a cup size too small,44115,3,1
296,44116,This hat is cute but the measurements are off.,44116,3,-1
297,44116,"The crown on the hat I received is 3"" deep - not 4.5"" as stated.",44116,3,1
298,44116,This makes a big difference in the look and fit of the hat.,44116,3,1
299,44116,Thankfully it has a wide brim so that kind of makes up for it.,44116,3,-1
300,44116,"The brim is also much straighter than it looks in the photos, so it fits kind of like a cloche hat.",44116,3,3
301,44116,"I'm a woman so I'm okay with that, but I can't imagine a man wearing this.",44116,3,-1
302,44116,I did receive this lightening fast and well packaged as always with e4hats!,44116,3,0
303,44117,A little too wide  but nice overall,44117,3,1
304,44118,I wasn't thrilled with this shirt.,44118,3,-1
305,44118,"It didn't look like I thought it would, and the material was a bit cheap feeling.",44118,3,3
306,44118,"I thought it would have more of the ""cold shoulder"" look, but it doesn't.",44118,3,-1
307,44118,You can barely see the detail of the straps.,44118,3,3
308,44119,"pockets are a bit large, but overall its an ok product.",44119,3,-1
309,44120,Cheaper looking than expected.,44120,3,-1
310,44120,Will work great after some fixing.,44120,3,3
311,44120,Definitely did not look like the picture.,44120,3,2
312,44121,The top portion is a bit see through.,44121,3,3
313,44121,"They placed those foamy pads where the breasts go and it just looks awful, need to remove or find a way to get a light fabric to cover it and make it not see through especially in that area.",44121,3,-1
314,44121,It's beautiful but a bit cheaply made.,44121,3,3
315,44121,Not bad for the cost.,44121,3,-1
316,44122,This was very cute...,44122,3,-1
317,44122,But the bottom was smaller so if you have thick thighs it's a no...,44122,3,1
318,44122,I washed it once and it fell apart... Do not buy unless you only want it to wear once...,44122,3,3
319,44123,This is a super cute top but it is so small!,44123,3,-1
320,44123,I ordered a size up and it is too tight across my bust.,44123,3,1
321,44124,These are mostly what I expected for the price.,44124,3,-1
322,44124,"They are slightly bigger than expected, and seem cheaply made, but have been durable so far.",44124,3,-1
323,44124,Am looking for magnetic clasps to replace what is on them as the current ones make them hard to put on snugly.,44124,3,-1
324,44125,"A little more sheer than expected, but I always wear long tops with leggings, so not a very big deal.",44125,3,-1
325,44126,It was the length of a shirt.....,44126,3,-1
326,44127,Image and text are pretty pixilated...I have seen the image before it looks like a low res copy.,44127,3,2
327,44127,Not worth the price.,44127,3,-1
328,44128,This wasn't the worse dress but I agree it looks like someone drapes!!,44128,3,-1
329,44128,Not wasn't what I expected,44128,3,-1
330,44129,"My daughter absolutely Loved the shoes, however, the plastic pulled from the toe and I had to send them back.",44129,3,3
331,44130,Fits okay..size chart a little off...,44130,3,1
332,44131,little bit more vibrant then I thought,44131,3,-1
333,44132,"Cute when brand new, but not so after the laundry cycle.",44132,3,-1
334,44132,"The rouching got more out of shape with every trip through the washer and dryer: tight in some spots, baggy in others.",44132,3,3
335,44132,OK for a single occasion where you want baby to have cute little Mary Jane feet.,44132,3,1
336,44133,Size runs a little small.,44133,3,1
337,44133,"Sleeves are a little  long, go figure.",44133,3,1
338,44134,"Smaller then expected , and color is not that noticeable !",44134,3,1
339,44135,Very Cute but runs SMALL,44135,3,-1
340,44136,The swim suit is cute but it runs short.,44136,3,-1
341,44136,U have to have a very short torso,44136,3,1
342,44137,I wish there was a size X small.,44137,3,1
343,44137,The small/medium was perfect right after my section but once the fluid was off my belly the small medium doesn't give the compression to my scar that I would like.,44137,3,1
344,44138,I like it but it was more of a long sweater than a dress.,44138,3,-1
345,44139,"Really cute bathing suit, although it runs a little small and I wish the tassels were longer.",44139,3,1
346,44139,It will do nicely as a back up suit :),44139,3,-1
347,44140,"I read some reviews advancing to size up because it was small, so I did, and I ended up with a s*** two sizes bigger than I needed.",44140,3,1
348,44140,I guess it depends on your body proportions.,44140,3,1
349,44140,Also this blouse is not all that pretty in person but I will definitely wear it sometime,44140,3,-1
350,44141,Just received it and tried it on.,44141,3,-1
351,44141,I have a 29in waist and ordered the medium.,44141,3,-1
352,44141,"I'm starting off on the second row of hooks already, as the first row is too big.",44141,3,1
353,44141,"Not sure that if I'd ordered the Small, it would have fit at all.",44141,3,1
354,44141,I have a size Med Squeem that is now too big but the size Small is too small so I opted for this one because it has 3 rows of hooks.,44141,3,1
355,44141,Squeem should make theirs with 3 rows as well.,44141,3,1
356,44141,It's a lot softer on the inside than my Squeem.,44141,3,3
357,44141,I'll update my review to see if this one gets better.,44141,3,-1
358,44141,UPDATE: I returned it.,44141,3,-1
359,44141,"After putting it on, it bunched up in the back and the sides.",44141,3,1
360,44141,"Didn't have as much compression as I prefer, maybe because the material felt so lightweight?",44141,3,3
361,44142,"I love the shirt, but for some reason it took a REALLY REALLY long time to ship",44142,3,0
362,44143,All I have to say is I should have gotten an Extra Large.,44143,3,1
363,44143,Other than that the coat is actually very decent for the price.,44143,3,-1
364,44144,"Thought it had pockets though
Disappointed there are none",44144,3,-1
365,44145,It is tight fitting with long sleeves and the material is light and thin.,44145,3,-1
366,44145,One issue is that the zipper gets stuck easily.,44145,3,3
367,44145,The colors online are very accurate to what you get.,44145,3,2
368,44145,The colors don't bleed or anything.,44145,3,2
369,44145,I returned mine because it wasn't the material I was looking for and the sleeves are too long.,44145,3,-1
370,44146,The shirt is really pretty.,44146,3,-1
371,44146,"All the reviews said to follow the size chart because it tends to run small, so I did and the shirt is way too large for me.",44146,3,1
372,44148,Extra Large fit as a normal large would have been.,44148,3,1
373,44148,Could have been just a tad bigger.,44148,3,1
374,44149,Fits okay but the fabric is too stiff,44149,3,3
375,44150,"Lava Beads and Glass Beads are really nice, but the Hamsa Hand is made of plastic not metal which means eventually the silver paint will come off.",44150,3,3
376,44150,The elastic strings that the beads are threaded on is starting to frey so I don't wear much.,44150,3,3
377,44150,I may cut them open and re thread on the clear plastic stretchy string and replace the plastic Hamsa Hands with metal ones.,44150,3,3
378,44150,I really like the jewelry and would like to wear almost every day but can't until I go to AC Moore to make changes.,44150,3,-1

381,44151,"The fabric shown in the picture shows a light, cotton blend that you can slightly see through but, that is not close to what I received.",44151,3,3
382,44151,It seems to be a pretty hardy blend though.,44151,3,3

392,44157,Build quality seems fine to me.,44157,3,3
393,44157,I've worn these a few days.,44157,3,-1
394,44157,"They are easy to adjust, and I usually forget I'm wearing them they're so comfortable.",44157,3,3
395,44157,"As others have said, the fasteners here will only work on verrrry thin socks, or, as long as the top 1"" of your socks are very thin.",44157,3,3
396,44157,"Like, on a scale of 1-10, 1 being women's panty hose and 10 being thick wool boot/winter socks, your socks couldn't be much thicker than a 2.",44157,3,-1
397,44157,"I guess the designers opted for this fastener design so as to reduce risk of damage to the socks attached to them, whereas something simpler and stronger like alligator clips would eventually eat through a sock.",44157,3,-1
398,44158,I am petite and this was to long for me.,44158,3,1
399,44158,I had to return it.,44158,3,-1

404,44160,Waist is small and does not stretch a lot.,44160,3,-1
405,44160,it's a bit difficult getting past my upper thighs and butt.,44160,3,1
406,44160,So perhaps medium would've been better.,44160,3,1
407,44161,It was completely sheer and I am a c-cup and it was too tight even in an XL.,44161,3,1
408,44162,super SHORT... not a dress... decent fabric and workmanship...,44162,3,-1

417,44167,I like them and they fit okay but are a bit tight.,44167,3,1
418,44167,The toe box is wide enough but not deep and the shoe is not quite as lengthy as the old shoe of the same size.,44167,3,1
