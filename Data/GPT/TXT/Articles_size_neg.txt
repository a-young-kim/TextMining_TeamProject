same So one was to small and for the other was a bit large.This would only fit like the photo if you were a small child.Just poor quality all around, size was too small even though I ordered bigger than usual.Very strange fitThe length is not what appears.Shirt was way too short.It was a little snug, but the length was the biggest isssue.I ordered my daughter a medium and it is very small.It actually would fit my year old.I'm usually a small for it and it's so small it's not even close to the picture.Suggest you get sizes up to look like pictureThe holes were small and i didn't realize until i was already out of the house.They weren't even small on meI have multiple items by this brand and usually wear a size small.This was a medium, fit rrectly, and all of a sudden the product rips on the send wear.very smallThis was really big for my face kind of bulky it also really looks cheapLove the look of the suit, I bought a size large but unfortunately the top seem like an extra small and the bottoms were so big they we're falling off.Size portion between the top and the bottom is significantly off.Ordered a size Large.They are short in height.This shirt is made a side smaller.So an xl really needs a an xxl or xxxlPurchased a XL and it fits like a Small ( pretty disappointed since the pattern is great.. also the fabric is kinda sheen silky tton like.The smallest XL, I've ever seen.The length does not match the size.Runs tooo small..Sleeves are very short It is rather blah on your wrist.Really bulky and huge.not stretchy and way small.Definitely wouldn't work for s tall person.Item was too big.Torso entirely too long, so shoulder area stuck up.After waiting days for my order seriously the slow boat from China I got the wrong size, wrong design, and this shirt it tight in the hips and I have small legs and average hips.There are no bust darts so it fits like a bag.I ordered a x for a party....it is more like a size medium.Very small and cheapShirt size chart is inrrect on seller page so buy a size smaller.I'm normally a large, but due to the other reviews, I ordered up to a XXL.It was about the size of a medium.and still the cups didn't even fully ver my chest.As a plus size woman, this is a terrible fit.I have no clue who on earth uld even fit these.Way smaller than I thought it would be Fit is too snug.Not sized rrectly at all.I did not like and very smallBought as a gift and bought a size bigger large) because she likes her clothes loose fitting but it was more like a size small.was so small and i ordered a size bigger than i usually wearIt's like a size Really ashamed that the sizing chart did not accurately estimate sizes.The st of the item was very inexpensive, however you cannot go by the sizing chart.I did mine is extremely to big on me.Ordered a x and was like a mediumThe shoulder strap is too small and it's too thin and it just looks cheap.It should probably be worn as a shirt, way too short.Looks and fits nothing like the picture.They don't sit straight on my body even when my hands are down, they twist the fabric like it's wrapping sideways around my arm.This shirt does not have that length, in fact the bottom half of the shirt is shorter than the top part and barely reaches the top of my pants.It's cinched up, but it's REALLY wide.Like, almost a belled sleeve.Also, I ordered a size , but the tag doesn't say , it says XL.It's too small, the size is inrrect.I orderd Xlarge and was way to small, If it is cashmir it sucks...more like woolI followed the size guide and even ordered a size up based on other reviews that said it ran small.It still didn't even me close to fitting.Fit was absolutely terribleI am size small..It fits me well but doesn't look like picture at all..I believe I was sent the wrong size because this is four times smaller then said it was.It is now beme my skinny dress.The drop on the handle is entirely too short.Let me put it this way, it wouldn't be long enough for a little person.I am nfused as to why a drop on a bag of this size would be so short.Ordered a medium because I know I have a bigger butt.The top is super flimsy and I wish there uld've been a choice to order a small for the top and medium for the bottoms.My bra size is B so having a smaller chest didn't fill in the top enough to where it wouldn't be flimsy.Way, way, way too small.It came in gray and what seems to be an extra extra small.Once I get them halfway in my ear you can't fit the other piece in, it just won't go back and then I notice the other ones bottom piece won't me out.And the pieces are so small they slip out of your finger, took forever for them to me.Ordered much larger size and still too tight.Cute but WAY WAY TOO SMALLIt more so fits a medium and I got a large size.This is not a

once.Way too small in torso area.If the item is supposed to fit as pictured, I would have needed it to be literally twice the size of what I received which is a tight crew neck tank that came to the top of my hip bone.Not the large bow that appears to have the tank gathered in the center.Super cheap and I don't mean because of the price, and gold wrap belt isn't what expected.If you are a large man looking for a large or xxl tank top do not buy this product.The XXL I just purchased is small enough to form fit a small man.I checked the measurements that would fit my size but when the shirt

width, but did like the styleShirt is way too short and square looking.It fit awkwardly, was a little too small, and not as graceful as what you see in the picture.Came so large it looked like a cheap hat you buy at a nvenient store.so short that I don't even know how they can mark this as a dress.WAAAY TOOO SMALLI bought the MENS leather trousers in XXL and what i got was something that would only fit a small woman.Way too small if you have curves, fits like a shirt but even then doesn't look flattering (I ordered two sizes up and it is still very small on me.I'm a little surprised because this usually works when ordering Asian sizes.It was smaller than I expected.This top is cheap and size is mpletely inaccurate.Looked small on everyone I have seen it on tried to was it and still big plus I have I big head and still to bigI really loved them the size was great and everything even thought one was crooked and then like weeks after it started to turn brown..These gloves are huge fit OK, a bit small, short in sleeve and length) but the other were ridiculously small- like child sized.I would say save your money and buy domestically where at least the sizing is sane, and you can return it if needed.Dislike the sizes very unreliable measurements, runs really, really smallThe brim of this hat is extra jumbo size.The other certainly has a wide brim this one is ridiculously large.With the picture it looks like it is going to be long but when it arrived it was not long but instead wide.Material feels cheap and the size is extremely small.I ordered the biggest size and it didn't even fit at all, very tight in the breast and armpit area.Acrding to the description it me in Men's - size...It is not even size These run extremely small and short.Arms are somewhat tightWAY TOO SMALL..I ordered a medium and it was more like child size.For this to fit me I would probably have to get a XLI'm lbs and have slender legs but these were so tight I uld barely get them on without cutting off circulation.They fit like mpression" running tights for those familiar mpression wear.Maybe it was just a fluke but some of the VIV leggings and/or capris are hit and miss with sizing.they were so small and did not work.they are child sized .. terrible purchase they are short and fit tight ..Send problem size was super misleading.I'm '" about lbs and the length of the torso was too short, creating a wedgie.Fits extremely tight and very cheaply made strings hanging and this material.Much too small, for a very small personToo small, you can barely see the diamondsSize is not true to size.Waste of money, even the small size is big and didn't work for me.Its a very pretty shirt but, fits very small.It's short and wide so if your trying to get the camel toe look then buy it I ordered a large because I'm a medium and it fit like am extra smallThe sleeves came to my elbows now I'm only ' so you can say this totally was a rip off.Clings tightly like mpression gear.I wish the TWO) I ordered would have fit, but they were both too small.Dress suited for a thin personnot seemless at all the panty line will definitely show The medium was too small, the large was too big, and I usually wear a US small in one piece bathing suits.In addition the top is way too wide no matter the size and the material is cheap.Will be returning both sizes.Much larger than indicated by the size chart.My order size M But Which I received Size XXL Too large I want to replace or refundThe size is way off.Doesn't even fit a pinky.I think my body changed the way the dress should have fallen.Probably wouldn't even fit my year old sister.Cheap and tiny.The chest area was lopsided and about three inches too short for where breasts actually are.The waist is also too high.Ok...uld've been a bit biggerI normally wear a X but this product runs smaller.way way way too small for a large busted woman.Too small for its sizeBar to long.Runs at least sizes smaller.More so, the half belt and A-line shape make it look like a ladies jacked.However, you have to press in a piece of metal to open it.It also runs slightly large.The bracelet was gaudy and the charms too small.It stopped at my mid calf.If you are petite,small chested and have a tummy this dress is for youBut order two sizes up.Skirt a little too short and the jacket was way too tight.Cute but smaller than actual size and hurts badly.I am ' '' and with what I believe to be a fairly average body shape.It runs relatively small and the short's inseam length is way too short.I'm normally a small/medium in shorts, so when I read it runs small I ordered a large.Even with the large there is no way to escape a permanent wedgie and extreme cameltoe.It's vers half of breast aarrrgggh I can't return it either . Its almost perfect except it runs short It's meant for a child, I guess.pretty but runs smallOrdered a XXL that wouldn't even fit a year old.Have to return, WAY too small at the openingI just received this short and it was WAY too small.Do not waist your money on this item..

case.Gave it to my daughter who had a smaller phone.Too small, same size on all three items, only fit.Not the size they said it was fo shoThe shoulders seemed to be disproportionately larger than the waist...almost reminiscent of 's football shoulders.Not sure if it was just my straight-all-the-way-down frame my shoulders are slightly larger than my waist, so any clothing that's even the slightest bit bulky at the shoulders makes me look awful)I like the shirt, but it is way too small.I have a Kim K's bottom, which is unheard of in the Asian mmunity.Cute dress but it runs small.I ordered one size up but the dress was still to small.did not fit well,poorly madeThe shirt is sized much wider then usual and the tton material is very stiff even after a washing, not soft whatsoever.I ordered a
