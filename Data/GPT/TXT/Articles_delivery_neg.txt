China.They took to long for me to get them.It took weeks to get here, and after I tried it on and it was HORRIBLE, I found out I had to pay to return it.I had thought they shipped the wrong

received this shirt days later than prime nd day shipping.Wish I uld return it as I can't even wear it, but the st of shipping it back is almost as much of the suit.The package had Chinese script on

order from them againI sent it back to China expensive) and have not received my refund that was a month ago).It was supposed to arrive between August .This is a joke, looks like they just place scrap material in the bag and shipped it....but guess that was to be expected for the price.I'm very disappointed, waste of money and doesn't worse the trouble to return it... runs small too...So wrong, but I did not realize until way after my order that it shipped from Chinathe only reason why a gave a star because it came faster then what the date I was suppose to receive it it other then thatThey kept

error.Paid expedited shipping--it arrived days late.arrived earlier than expected, but the first time I put it on, the button snapped.I didn't return them because the shipment would st me almost as much as the earrings and therefore this would be a waste of my time.Also it took almost two months to arrive.I was going to return them but return shipping was more than the pants st.And the shipping took very long.They are good to do business with but just disappointed that it ran so small and that I had to pay shipping to get a full refund so I lost money on this and need to find someone that I can give it to.Warning if you try to return them you will pay more than what it st to purchase them to ship them back to ChinaIf its shipped out of China, think twice.Seller was also reluctant to

arrive super fast though.I'd have to pay for shipping back to China then only receive half or less of the st for dress in return.It was fairly slow shipping, and once it finally arrived I have to say I was disappointed.Arrived quickly but was damagedit took days to arrive, which was a bit of a bummer.This is a pretty good phone case, it shipped from China even though the sellers website said Texas.I was disappointed to learn that the return shipping st of . is deducted from the amount refunded, so I did not want to take a chance on an exchange.Since I only used it for dress and used

Seller and i am waiting for a refund.And I ordered it late, so it arrived on Christmas Eve, so I gave the present to my grandson anyway, because it was too late to do anything about it.Took forever to get.It took forever to get to me too.Maybe because arrived already broken?Shipping took foreeeeeever though.I've ordered international before and shipping didn't take a month so that was a shock that
