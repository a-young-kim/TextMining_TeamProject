124,22044,"Hides tummy well, easy to put on.",22044,2,1
125,22044,But I do not like the way my butt looks in it.,22044,2,1
126,22044,"It does lift my butt, but it also makes the shape look weird.",22044,2,1
127,22044,I do have a big bottom so maybe that's it,22044,2,-1

158,22060,and the lace over the boob section is already coming unstitched and i have not even wore it yet.,22060,2,3
159,22060,If these things were corrected it would be a great top.,22060,2,-1
160,22061,"Because the fit was too small (and I ordered a size larger than my normal), the shirt would curl/ride up when I moved in it.",22061,2,1

173,22065,Part of the belt fell off the second time I wore it.,22065,2,3
174,22065,The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it held my pants up.,22065,2,-1
175,22066,hard to move arms without exposing myself,22066,2,1
176,22067,"After reading the size chart and carefully choosing what was meant to be a size twelve to fourteen I ordered this what I received was about half that size, in fact if was tight on my sister who is a size six.",22067,2,1

184,22068,"It is smaller in both brim and fit, the ventilation holes are no longer metal but wrapped in thread.",22068,2,1
185,22068,I'll keep it as a backup or something but will probably be stitching new velcro onto my other one since it actually fits and feels better.,22068,2,3
186,22069,Didn't like the way it looked too small,22069,2,1
187,22070,If you are a size LARGE and UP...just a warning.,22070,2,1

199,22074,"It's not quite big enough for an overnight bag, but is similar in size to a diaper bag.",22074,2,1

214,22082,This shirt fits great over my torso but the arms are quite small.,22082,2,1
215,22082,This makes wearing the shirt uncomfortable and look awkward because the sleeves can only slide up so far.,22082,2,1
216,22082,I would recommend this to someone who is slender and does not have muscular or larger than average arms.,22082,2,1

222,22086,"The ears are also too heavy, causing the bunnies to flop dow and stick out.",22086,2,3

240,22096,Way too much sequin for me...looked like something for someone older...like in their 50's.,22096,2,2

246,22099,"The skirt was well made, but I found the style to be more attractive on the hanger than on me.",22099,2,-1
247,22099,The fabric is thick and satiny and the pleats are fairly stiff so it stands out around your hips.,22099,2,3
248,22099,"Also, in person I found the cat heads disconcerting rather than cute.",22099,2,-1
249,22100,The small size fits like an XS.,22100,2,1

276,22113,These run very small.,22113,2,1
279,22113,Ignore the size chart order a size or 2 larger for USA women....if I knew it  was  coming from China I would have  ordered a larger size.,22113,2,1

302,22118,I ordered a large and it barely fit as a size 6.,22118,2,1
303,22118,I reordered an XL.,22118,2,1

328,22132,It runs very small.,22132,2,1
330,22132,It is also very short.,22132,2,1

340,22138,Seller originally was communicating with me on getting me the missing mittens but has since gone radio silent.,22138,2,0
341,22138,I would not recommend this item if you are expecting 6 different colors.,22138,2,-1
342,22139,"Although the size and measurements were what I needed, It was much smaller than I expected...sleeves were very snug, and could barely pull i over my chest.",22139,2,1
343,22139,I guess the cut was a bit off.,22139,2,1
344,22139,"I will use it for a gift as it is too small for me and the XL is only slightly bigger, so it will be snug as well.",22139,2,1

350,22143,I was excited to receive my socks then I noticed the socks weren't the same color as they are in the picture.,22143,2,2
351,22143,They are a light green instead on a darkish green.,22143,2,2
352,22143,The light green ends up making the socks look very weird.,22143,2,2

355,22145,"The cut is described as slim it, it should read more like shrink wrap.",22145,2,1
356,22145,When considering this product note: order two to three sizes up from what you would normally wear.,22145,2,1
357,22145,The cufflink buttons are also very cheap and are hard to unbutton.,22145,2,3
358,22146,I usually love PattiBoutik but this dress was a bit of a bummer.,22146,2,-1

360,22146,The dress is also really short (it covered my butt with only a few inches to spare).,22146,2,1
361,22146,I usually wear a medium in their shirts but the medium dress was really snug and uncomfortable in the arms.,22146,2,1
362,22147,It's pretty but i got it for myself and its small like it would fit a Child.,22147,2,1
363,22147,i put it on and it was like a choker on me if you like that kind of look,22147,2,1
364,22148,"I ordered this because I needed a white purse to match my shoes but it is more of a tan color, Not white!",22148,2,2

379,22152,"Nice to wear for a couple of hours, not so nice if you want them as a regular wear.",22152,2,3
380,22153,These would have been the perfect color for a costume I need if they fit.,22153,2,-1
381,22153,They are a good length but you would have to be a twig to squeeze into these leggings.,22153,2,1
382,22154,"It fits the description, but they are ugly..super thick and a weird material.",22154,2,3
383,22154,They will sit in my closet til I can give them away.rough itchy material,22154,2,3
384,22156,Make sure you wash alone inside out...I washed it once and now it is unwearable due to fading...she had worn it once!!!!!,22156,2,3

387,22157,It is silky soft just not proportionate.,22157,2,3
388,22158,"The lace was nice and stretchy, and it really could face been cute, but the collar didn't even wrap the whole way around the neck, and the button to hold it together didn't really do its job...",22158,2,3
389,22158,"There were loops of thread sticking out, as well.",22158,2,3
390,22158,"I suppose these things can be fixed by a tailor, or yourself if you know anything about sewing, and if so, go for it!",22158,2,-1
391,22158,"But otherwise, I don't recommend it.",22158,2,-1

416,22171,"As for the fit I am 5'0, 160 pounds.",22171,2,1
417,22171,Length wise it was perfect and it fit on the arms but it was just a step away from being too tight.,22171,2,1
418,22171,It does say one size fits all but I would advise anyone with larger arms/wears bigger than a medium in tops not to buy it.,22171,2,1
419,22171,Plus it isn't the right color.,22171,2,2
420,22172,"Two small in the crotch, also ripped in the crotch.",22172,2,1

424,22173,I was so upset because after I received this swim suit I didn't have time to find another.,22173,2,-1
425,22173,The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I got exactly what I paid for.,22173,2,-1
426,22173,I wish I would've just spent more money to get something with a better quality.,22173,2,3
427,22174,I bought 5 of them and was very disappointed.,22174,2,-1
