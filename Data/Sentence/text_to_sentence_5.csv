88639,As it was my son's first Christmas without his dad I wanted him to have something special.,88639,5
88639,The irish design made it even better.,88639,5
88639,"Filling it with ashes was a little difficult, but definately worth it.",88639,5
88640,I was honestly expecting a normal cheap hat.,88640,5
88640,"Not this one, this is a very quality hat.",88640,5

88648,Perfect,88648,5
88649,I ordered teh same size in black and they were a little small but the brown ones fit perfectly,88649,5
88650,This jacket replaces a leather coat that I've owned for 2 decades; hopefully with a little care this will also last that long.,88650,5
88650,"This jacket works with the included belt or without, and there is plenty of pocket space to store your rubble.",88650,5
88650,"I wish the lining on the pockets was thicker than what this came with (my keys tore holes into the pocket lining after a couple of months) but other than that this coat, when worn with a hooded sweatshirt underneath will keep you toasty right down into the teens temperatures.",88650,5
88650,"Plus, it gets random compliments from strangers on its looks.",88650,5
88650,Can't beat this coat with a stick!,88650,5

88655,Received way faster than estimated.,88655,5
88655,Recommend.,88655,5
88656,I ordered the large and I feel it fits more like a medium although it still looks amazing and that won't keep me from wearing it.,88656,5
88656,I'm actually planning on ordering a couple of more in different colors.,88656,5
88656,I love it.,88656,5
88656,:),88656,5
88657,I was in between sizes and went with the smaller.,88657,5
88657,It's a little too small.,88657,5
88657,I'll be ordering the next size up though.,88657,5
88657,The skirt is nicely made and cute on.,88657,5
88657,It ships from China and I was very hesitant to order from there.,88657,5
88657,I've had some really bad experiences with returns with overseas companies.,88657,5
88657,I feared the worst when the first try didn't fit.,88657,5
88657,It turns out they have a US address for returns though.,88657,5

88661,Works better than expected.,88661,5
88661,I had to open my mind to a different type of wallet.,88661,5
88662,This product definitely does not fail when it comes to keeping your shirt down throughout your work day.,88662,5
88662,"First, make sure when you are clipping in your shirt, to make sure the teeth of the clip are on both sides of the shirt.",88662,5
88662,"It is very easy to miss the teeth and clip on the metal side- this will lead you to think that the clip doesn't hold, but of course, that is not the case.",88662,5
88662,"My next recommendation is to spread the Y clips as far as they can go, that way the shirt is not bunched up in several places.",88662,5
88662,"Lastly, I recommend to loosen the straps until you feel comfortable.",88662,5
88662,You do not want it pulling down on your shirt so tight that the shirt starts to choke your neck.,88662,5
88662,"The first picture of my shirt tucked in is without the product, the second picture of my shirt tucked in is with the product.",88662,5
88662,"My pictures below show how the product was package, the items contained, and the functionality of it.",88662,5
88662,You honestly have to see it in person to notice the difference.,88662,5
88662,I cannot wait to wear this product to the wedding I am going to this weekend.,88662,5
88662,I definitely recommend this product!,88662,5

88665,Super cute kimono!,88665,5
88665,Bought this for my trip to Disney World.,88665,5

88672,It is as sparkly and fits with my engagement ring perfectly.,88672,5
88672,"Diamonds are not quite as clear as I would have liked them to be, but still sparkles and is the right price for us.",88672,5
88672,I will be ordering another one to even out the ring.,88672,5
88672,I am a 5.5 and ordered 5.5 and it fits just like my other ring.,88672,5

88690,It even has a lining inside.,88690,5
88690,"It is not my favorite, but it is growing on me.",88690,5
88690,It is a little different from the other fedoras I own from the same company (the Bailey Curtis).,88690,5
88690,I like to wear those with the front brim flipped down.,88690,5
88690,"On this hat, however, the brim really curls up high in the back, and when you flip the brim down in the front, it gives you a look I associate with cartoon images of Dick Tracy.",88690,5
88690,I personally don't care for that look.,88690,5
88690,So I tried wearing the brim straight in the front.,88690,5
88690,"It still curves down a little, but it gives the hat a completely different look that I like much better.",88690,5
88690,I receive tons of compliments on it.,88690,5
88691,I love how it fits and the opal along with the design is so pretty.,88691,5

88695,Runs a little small and length is best if you are short.,88695,5
88695,I am 5ft2 and prepregnancy a size 4-6.,88695,5
88695,I bought in medium and fits me now at 26weeks pregnant with my second baby.,88695,5
88695,I would like to size up to large since I plan to wear it for maternity photos in a month but large is not in stock currently.,88695,5
88695,"Color is as shown, a royal blue.",88695,5
88695,Lace is almost too tight on my arms.,88695,5
88695,Size up is my recommendation,88695,5
88696,Great Product and price!,88696,5
88697,I ordered these leggings a little worried that they wouldn't fit because they're one size fits all and the model in the picture looks so skinny.,88697,5
88697,But I was really happy to find that they fit really well!,88697,5
88697,"I'm usually a size seven pants, but they're stretchy so they'll probably fit up to size ten.",88697,5
88697,Also the horizontal stripes are really slimming and adorable.,88697,5
88697,they aren't as see through as most of the comments say they are.,88697,5
88697,They are a bit thin though but if you don't mind that they are really lovely.,88697,5
88698,"I know this is probably a knock-off of the original Samantha Vega purse, but it appears to be great quality that I hope will last.",88698,5
88698,It feels sturdy and the lining doesn't seem like it will tear.,88698,5
88698,The only thing I don't like is that I thought it would be a little better and it smells like modeling paint.,88698,5
88699,"Well, I like it, but; I was kinda hoping the bracelet was little thicker.",88699,5
88699,I'm looking for a heavier type of bracelet.,88699,5
88699,"But, I'm still wearing the bracelet.",88699,5
88699,Thank-You!,88699,5
88700,I ordered one size bigger mainly because I didn't want anything too tight and my boyfriend absolutely loved it.,88700,5
88700,It's a very sexy outfit and the fabric was very comfortable and easy to wash without tearing.,88700,5

88704,I look amazing...true to size...,88704,5
88705,Beautiful.,88705,5

88716,I was also pleasantly surprised by just how fast it arrived.,88716,5
88716,I like to use the front zipper pocket for my phone and that allows more storage inside the clutch.,88716,5

89249,I  love the way it fits.,89249,5
89249,It is very loose and comfortable.,89249,5
89249,The  armholes are not too big so you don't have to wear a camisole underneath.,89249,5
89249,I wear it as a dress and also with leggings.,89249,5
89249,I've gotten lots of compliments.,89249,5

89252,Fits well and easy to use,89252,5
89253,I needed a purse with lots of pockets that was preferably large enough to hold a water bottle so I could easily carry everything I need for work.,89253,5
89253,I'm so glad that I found this purse.,89253,5
89253,The color is really nice and it feels very sturdy.,89253,5
89253,"I like the water resistant fabric and the large, easy to use zippers.",89253,5
89253,"There are so many places for keys, wallet, and everything else you might need to carry, but unlike a lot of fashion purses, all of the pockets expand out so it doesn't make the center compartment feel any smaller.",89253,5
89253,It's a great everyday purse and I would consider buying another in a different color.,89253,5
89254,Great deal.,89254,5
89255,Beautiful  dress.,89255,5
89255,Somewhat sheer a slip should be worn underneath.,89255,5

89257,Except hers was made of gold & lapis gemstone  with a diamond for every city they had lived together in.,89257,5
89257,"(My Dad was a romantic son-of-a-gun)

89258,The inserts have improved my life so much.,89258,5
89258,"I have gotten relief from constant heel pain (spurs, tendinitis and planter fasciitis) it's a miracle for my feet.",89258,5
89258,These Pinnacles are a bit less money and a bit less cushioned than the Powerstep Pro but I got these Pinnacles for a pair of shoes I wear around the house.,89258,5
89258,The Pros cushioning made that shoe too snug.,89258,5
89258,"I buy the Pros for walking, shopping etc.",89258,5
89258,I have always had foot problems and wore custom made orthotics for about 20 years but finally gave up on them.,89258,5
89258,"I was reluctant to try another orthotic, but so delighted I did.",89258,5
89258,Prior to using Powerstep I was so discouraged and thinking I would need surgery.,89258,5

89266,I purchased this insert after returning another one that broke right after taking it out of it's bag.,89266,5
89266,Should have bought this one from the beginning.,89266,5
89267,"Beautifully made and very soft, though the arms are very long, not as in picture,as they appear 3/4 sleeve,",89267,5
89268,I had to get a replacement wedding band after my fingers swelled up from pregnancy.,89268,5
89268,I knew I wanted rose gold but I didn't want to spend the crazy amount of money on it knowing my fingers would go back down in time.,89268,5
89268,"It took me awhile to figure out my correct size, but the seller was very kind to let me return each ring back and get a new size without any issues whatsoever.",89268,5
89268,"In fact, they had already shipped out the new size before I even went to the FedEx drop off location with the old ring.",89268,5
89268,"The color is not a true rose gold color, it looks more gold to me, but it is beautiful nonetheless and a great deal for the price.",89268,5
89268,I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an economical and gorgeous dainty ring.,89268,5

90228,You don't need the plastic bits if you don't have bunions.,90228,5
90228,Buy the cheap rubbing alcohol to condition the inside part of the leather before stretching.,90228,5
90228,"Use it liberally, then apply the stretcher overnight.",90228,5
90228,I use rubbing alcohol and not the stuff marketed/made for shoe stretching because it's the same darn thing.,90228,5

90231,"It's a slim fit, so if you prefer baggy suits or are on the heavy side, this style won't work for you.",90231,5
90231,"But if you're thin to average build, just order the suit with the proper measurements and it should fit fine.",90231,5
90231,"I was pretty pleased, as the waist, chest, and arms seemed just as expected.",90231,5
90231,"If course you have to hem the legs, but that's normal.",90231,5

90528,"I will definitely recommended, and may even buy another in a different color!",90528,5
90529,"I loved these sandals, but they were not supportive enough for me.",90529,5
90529,I had to send them back but I choose to give 5 stars because they were adorable.,90529,5
90529,Loved the style n color.,90529,5
90529,Darn crazy ole feet!,90529,5

90531,Is wonderfull!!,90531,5
90531,!,90531,5
90532,I love these sweaters!,90532,5
90532,I bought one with a different pattern last year and I loved it enough to look for similar sweaters.,90532,5
90532,"I like the long and loose fit, but multiple size options would be nice.",90532,5
90532,"I always wear a t-shirt or tank under it, but it's thin enough to wear inside in the winter without overheating and makes a nice layer under a coat for outside.",90532,5
90533,nice belt,90533,5
90534,Good watch with an excellent movement.,90534,5
90534,ETA 2824-2 .,90534,5
90534,I love the features of being able to open the back to see the movement and being able to take off the cage.,90534,5
90534,This watch is built with a very strong rugged design.,90534,5
90534,Read the specs and investigate and then get one.,90534,5
90534,You will not regret it.,90534,5
90534,One of Invicta's finest.,90534,5
90534,Namaste',90534,5
90535,I checked every site I could to figure out the fit of these hoodies.,90535,5
90535,I ended up thinking that since I wear a large in North Face and most surf/skate brands that this large might be slightly big/exact fit.,90535,5
90535,I even thought I might go for a medium based on other reviews.,90535,5
90535,"Well, I found that this is slightly small.",90535,5
90535,Especially in my biceps area.,90535,5
90535,"They are not large or muscular, but they aren't teeny either.",90535,5
90535,That area and my chest area seemed to be the tight areas here.,90535,5
90535,"I expected the chest area, but figured if necessary, opening the zipper would be the remedy.",90535,5
90535,I suggest a XL for those that are on the fence.,90535,5
90535,But would the arms be bigger in that size?,90535,5
90535,I am not sure.,90535,5
90535,"Other than the size, the hoodie is cute.",90535,5
90535,It is much thicker than expected.,90535,5
90535,Nice for autumn/winter.,90535,5
90535,The graphic is clean.,90535,5
90535,The seams look good.,90535,5
90535,The zipper handle is a nice touch.,90535,5
90535,It's a nice hoodie overall.,90535,5
90535,Make sure to get one with returns if you aren't sure on size.,90535,5
90535,I was so sure about my research that I didn't.,90535,5
90535,So I need to stretch out those arms or get my arms skinnier.,90535,5
90536,"If you are taller (5'8"" and over) you need leggings for these.",90536,5
90537,It was absolutely perfect for the gender reveal party.,90537,5
90537,Ordered a small - my daughter is 4'11 and it was just right.,90537,5

90544,Still looks great.,90544,5
90544,No fading.,90544,5
90545,This romper is very well made.,90545,5
90545,I was surprised that it fit me since I have a size 10 hips and size 8 top and I almost never get romper to fit.,90545,5
90545,But this fit perfectly.,90545,5
90545,And it's so cute!,90545,5
90546,MY DAUGHTER IS PREGNANT AND SHE LOVED THIS,90546,5

90548,"It's not cheaply woven, and I've never had a seam come loose.",90548,5
90548,The sizes fit exactly as I'd expect them to.,90548,5
90548,It takes about 2 years of continuous wearing (2+ times a week est) and washing before you notice any fading.,90548,5
90548,"If you wear it less, the colors last much longer obviously.",90548,5
90548,The colors are amazing; all very rich and well dyed.,90548,5
90548,The pattern has always been 100% centered.,90548,5
90548,"The best thing about this shirt, for me, is the people I meet when I wear it.",90548,5
90548,"People come up to me and say, ""I love my pit bull too!""",90548,5
90548,and I end up making new friends.,90548,5
90548,"I also find the price very reasonable, especially for such a well made product.",90548,5
90548,I would recommend CafePress shirts.,90548,5
90549,Super cute socks.,90549,5
90549,These do NOT have non-slip soles so they are best for wearing with shoes.,90549,5

90555,Mary Poppins!,90555,5
90555,I can fit just a bit of stuff if I am just running to the store but if the kids start handing me crap it fits right in!,90555,5
90555,Picking up the grand baby?.....,90555,5
90555,diapers /wipes/ and an outfit fit right on in there!,90555,5

90555,"I can fit my 10 inch netbook, two hardback biology books, and a 1 inch binder in it at the same time!",90555,5
90555,or like I said just my keys and my phone and a bottle of water!,90555,5
90555,It has little bumpie things on the bottom so it doesn't sit on the floor in a restaurant too.,90555,5
90556,"i asked so many questions about these, i figured i needed to give back to the universe and review them myself when i finally got a pair.",90556,5
90556,"i love them, so five stars, but- read all the reviews, because most of them are true.",90556,5
90556,i SCOURED the internet looking for the perfect black bootie.,90556,5
90556,"they had to be versatile: winter/summer, casual/nice, leggings/bare-leg.",90556,5
90556,"these work, and they're unique enough to not go basic.",90556,5
90556,"though they come in various colors/materials, the black i ordered was a matte black, which is exactly what i wanted.",90556,5
90556,"the heel gives you that sophisticated ""i'm a lady"" sound when you walk.",90556,5
90556,"i love the ""flaps""- though i'm concerned they'll droop over time as some of the other reviewers mentioned.",90556,5
90556,"and, lastly, sadly, it's true- the back of the heel is too short to hold in your foot.",90556,5
90556,"don't even think about wearing no-show socks- you'll end up with a wad of sock up by the ball of your foot; regular socks work, but of course, you can see them through the flaps; and pantyhose also work.",90556,5
90556,"but, i happily deal with it.",90556,5
90557,worked out good!,90557,5

90564,Was a gift and was well received- the size 12 seems accurate to size.,90564,5
90564,"Be aware that this is a ""Back to the Future"" branded replica, not a ""Nike"" branded item.",90564,5
90564,"So, to look true to the film prop, I found decals on a popular online auction site and followed the directions to apply them to these shoes- it turned out looking great.",90564,5
90564,"It is indeed light-up in the clear bottom part, and wires with a tiny switch can be found protruding from the ankle area- this is easy to access both for charging (via included USB cable) and switching it on/off, as well as can be hidden out of sight.",90564,5

90572,Not bulky but warm.,90572,5
90572,"I found that if you put them on as pictured, they're good for working on a computer or tablet etc., but if you turn them around you can wear them just for warmth because they cover more of your hands that way.",90572,5

90765,"To be exact, I wanted the dress to arrive at my home atleast 10 days before the pageant.",90765,5

90765,The only alteration needed is under the arm.,90765,5

90765,The dress is beautiful.,90765,5

90787,"In reviewing the manual for my new solar charging watch, I came to realize that I just was not reaching the minimum daily time in the sun or a bright light and the battery was running down over a few of years.",90787,5
90787,"So after using this charger overnight to top off my new watch, I decided to see if I could invigorate my old, dead watch.",90787,5
90787,"I set it on the charger for a full day and not only did it appear fully restored, but the light was working again--this had stopped a few months after replacing the battery several years ago.",90787,5
90787,Now I have two perfectly good solar watches!,90787,5
90787,"The only (very minor) negatives are that the USB cable is relatively short (~ 3 ft) for where I want to use it, and even with the rubber gasket, enough light escapes out the sides to act as a nightlight.",90787,5

90818,My movement is great again!,90818,5

90818,"Needless to say with better movement across the board, I now have a better shot at winning more points!",90818,5
90818,A quick minor point in closing...I've only worn white shoes for badminton prior to this pair.,90818,5
90818,A couple of players in my badminton club wore this and I decided it wouldn't be so bad to break that tradition though and get a flashy looking pair for a change :),90818,5

90843,Amazing quality jeans but size is small for me,90843,5
90844,I love this!,90844,5
90844,"I had bought one of the larger ID wallets that could hold a phone in the back, but it was too large to put in my pocket when I was walking around without a purse, so this is absolutely perfect size for those tiny pockets they tend to put in women's jeans.",90844,5
90844,"The colors haven't faded so far, which was a problem with my last wallet, so that's always a plus.",90844,5
90844,"Personally I think the colors are good as well -- the dots aren't as overwhelming or busy as some of the Vera Bradley patterns, which I appreciate.",90844,5
90844,Overall a good product and hopefully one that will last a long time.,90844,5

90848,"Other than that it's a great pick, the buckle is removeable and easy to switch out.",90848,5
90849,I've worn thor-lo and smart wool but like these better than either for fit.,90849,5
90850,Both match perfectly and are the perfect weight.,90850,5
90850,Very smooth and comfortable!,90850,5
90851,This is the second dress I have purchased the first one was true to size this one is somewhat large.,90851,5

90868,I've had people at the stores ask where I purchased these and told them where.,90868,5

90914,Great product perfect condition my cousin loved it for her graduation,90914,5
90915,I've been using the KonMari decluttering method and decided that hanging my jewelry where I could properly see everything was a better alternative to hiding it all away in little boxes in my drawer where I often forgot what I had.,90915,5

90935,"Had I known how well it would fit when they were on sale, I would have ordered 3 or 4 :-) it is delicate and very lightweight.",90935,5
90936,"The straps were way too long (and couldn't be adjusted any shorter than I had already adjusted), but the rest of the suit fit perfectly, so I just shortened the straps on my own and it worked out great.",90936,5
90937,I have been looking for a lightweight green jacket for a very long time and I am so glad I took a chance and ordered this one.,90937,5
90937,It is so comfortable and the quality far exceeded my expectations.,90937,5
90937,I'm 5'6 160 lbs and I ordered the XL.,90937,5
90937,It is a bit big on me but that's what I wanted so I could comfortably fit sweaters under it.,90937,5

90937,I highly recommend this jacket!,90937,5

90940,My father will love them.,90940,5
90941,These are adorable!,90941,5
90941,I bought them to go with a pair of closed toe sandals that I couldn't wear because the seams rub my big toe joint in a very uncomfortable way.,90941,5
90941,"The sock seams come up right past where my shoe ends, adding a lace trim effect that adds a touch of elegance to already cute shoes.",90941,5
90941,"Now I can wear my sandals without the discomfort, and they look adorable with my ballerina flats too.",90941,5
90941,I've already worn three of the four colors and will reorder more.,90941,5

90943,Works great!,90943,5
90943,After reading reviews I decided to size up one size.,90943,5
90943,My daughter is 1 and in 12 month clothing.,90943,5

90944,I ordered the burgundy and it was true to color.,90944,5
90944,Very well made.,90944,5
90944,I did have to have it altered for length because it runs really long (which I guess is good for taller women).,90944,5
90944,Overall I am very happy with this purchase.,90944,5
90945,My husband loves this ring!,90945,5

90948,It was perfect and everyone loved it!,90948,5
90948,"After several performances, the stitching came loose under the arms but the fabric probably was only meant for Halloween or pillow play.",90948,5
90948,Not for extensive wearings.,90948,5
90948,Haha!,90948,5
90949,just right for a cover up!,90949,5
90950,I love this.,90950,5

90955,Runs about a half size larger,90955,5

91225,I even buy them for all the holidays so I can show off a little flair now and then.,91225,5
91225,Because I wear a uniform to work my options are limited as to what I get to wear on the personal side of things.,91225,5

91225,I have always seen ear cuffs before but never had the chance to get any.,91225,5
91225,What makes this set unique is the fact that you have a regular earring that attaches to an ear cuff via a simple short chain.,91225,5
91225,"So, not only do you have an earring but also an ear cuff.",91225,5
91225,"The cuff part, while not technically adjustable, can be maneuvered to your specific comfort level.",91225,5
91225,I don't really like the type of backs these come with but they are easily replaced with whatever you want.,91225,5

91228,Easier to clean up accidents than some of the thicker brands.,91228,5
91228,Still help keep them off the floor (if it is not just a really bad accident).,91228,5
91228,My kid LOVES the design!,91228,5

91234,"They seem sturdy, and he walks easily in them.",91234,5

91234,"When we got them, it rained a TON the next day.",91234,5
91234,So it was perfect for testing them out!,91234,5
91234,My son splashed around in the puddles as we walked up and down the street.,91234,5

91239,The only trouble with the order is that it did not make me look like that lovely model!,91239,5
91239,(That is a joke of course).,91239,5

91247,Very well made and was incredibly adorable.,91247,5
91247,I purchased this sized 4t for my 2t child.,91247,5
91247,I wanted ample opportunity to wear because of pricing of this item.,91247,5
91247,I was able to put ugg-style boots on as they were colored appropriately for costume instead of the paws for trick or treat.,91247,5
91247,The boots allowed for any baggy legs to be lifted enough to not rub the ground when walking.,91247,5
91247,"The inside was not too scratchy either, the thickness is appropriate for a midwest fall evening to keep warm with light clothing underneath.",91247,5
91248,Shoes took about a day or two of brealing in but after that the love affair started...very comfy...help my sore feet and protect it from our beautiful non forgiving ceramic tile.,91248,5

91253,This is yet another piece of amazing costume jewelry from a manufacturer who does excellent work.,91253,5
91253,"It has good weight to it hangs properly, the dome over the graphic lends an illusion of depth of field, and the photo simply doesn't do justice to it.",91253,5
91253,The artwork is beautifully and subtly shaded; it has incredible detail for a basically black and white illustration.,91253,5
91253,And I received it from China in two weeks.,91253,5
91253,"If you like the photo you will love this necklace, as I do.",91253,5

91259,Pretty much how I thought,91259,5
91260,"Great quality stainless steel barbells, and trust me my ears would know within less than able hour if they weren't of good quality, with as sensitive,as they are.",91260,5
91260,"Also love that 4 different shaped gems are included in the bundle (which I ordered 2 of), so I can have matching - yet ""differing"" shapes (per hole) - on both ears!",91260,5

91275,"She had an old one which was pretty frayed, so I purchased this one.",91275,5
91275,Fits perfectly!,91275,5
91276,I've been on the market for good maternity leggings and hadn't been able to find something that was good quality and shaped me while offering great compression!,91276,5
91276,!,91276,5
91277,Cute!,91277,5
91277,Seems to be somewhat good quality.,91277,5
91278,Always wanted a metal wallet.,91278,5
91278,Fits my few cards.,91278,5
91278,Had my bank card cloned a few months ago.,91278,5
91278,Thankfully was able to get that money back and a replacement card.,91278,5
91279,My husband love it,91279,5
91280,Satisfied with this hat an excellent addition to my inventory of caps...,91280,5

91281,Even after a year this wallet has held up.,91281,5
91281,The quality is really nice.,91281,5
91282,I bought this necklace as a gift but took it out of the box before wrapping it.,91282,5

91282,Amazing that it's a real leaf under all the coatings!,91282,5
91283,Loved it!!,91283,5
91283,!,91283,5
91284,These shoes are the talk of the town !,91284,5
91284,!,91284,5
91284,So cute and are super bright even during day !,91284,5
91284,My daughter loves them !,91284,5
91285,Very good quality,91285,5
91286,"Love this dress, received many compliments.",91286,5
91286,Fits relatively true to size (it could have been a bit tighter).,91286,5
91286,"I am 5'4"" and 120 pounds, boy-ish frame (little boobs, little hips).",91286,5
91286,Got the small and it was still beautiful and very comfortable.,91286,5
91286,Buy this if you are considering!,91286,5
91287,This is a great product for many reasons.,91287,5
91287,"The hanger is sturdy and will not break apart from the weight of holding too many pieces (it's what happened to my previous closet-hanging jewelry storage, hence I needed a new one).",91287,5
91287,"The pockets are larger than most of its kind, but I just store 2 types of the same earrings/set pieces in each zippered pocket, making my storage seem very organized and not haphazard.",91287,5
91287,And the zippers!,91287,5
91287,Most jewelry organizers have open pockets.,91287,5
91287,"However, with open pockets comes tarnishing of your silver pieces making it a necessity to wrap your silver in a ziplock and then place it in the pocket.",91287,5
91287,The zipper on this product eliminates that need.,91287,5
91287,This feature is what made me choose this product over all others on amazon.,91287,5
91287,"If my silver tarnishes, it's not going to be because of the zipper.",91287,5
91287,The colors/designs available are nice and meet a wide variety of people's choices.,91287,5
91287,I highly suggest this product.,91287,5
91287,"I will add that I also purchased a second jewelry storage, a black one shaped like a dress to hang my necklaces in.",91287,5
91287,"It was due to my heavy necklaces that my previous hanging jewelry storage broke, so I divided my expanding jewelry collection into 2 products.",91287,5
91287,The reason for this is because anything with too much weight will eventually collapse under the pressure and I don't want to purchase another one again for quite a few more years.,91287,5
91288,Love it,91288,5
91289,Fits great and keeps my face warm!,91289,5
91290,just way cool undies......,91290,5
91291,Fit perfectly,91291,5
91292,"Omg, these earrings are so beautiful!",91292,5
91292,I was very pleased when I opened the box.,91292,5
91292,They look like jewelry store quality.,91292,5
91292,I bought these to replace a pair that I had a missing one and these are absolutely even more beautiful than my real diamond earrings that I have in the heart shape.,91292,5
91292,Definitely a great purchase!,91292,5
91293,"Good,  kept hands warm and dry.",91293,5

91297,Medium fits well.,91297,5
91297,"I am 5'8"" & weight 160..",91297,5
91297,It fits great!,91297,5
91298,Another great product from Travelon.,91298,5
91298,"This wallet, along with the Anti-Theft Classic Messenger Bag, are 2 of the best travel related purchases I've ever made in the past 20 years.",91298,5
91298,Would def buy both again.,91298,5
91298,I use both now as my everyday wallet and bag.,91298,5
91298,"The quality is excellent, and I get a lot of compliments on the styling of the wallet.",91298,5
91298,Well worth the price!,91298,5
91299,Nice hoodie.,91299,5

91412,Let me start by saying I was blown away with the customer service that was provided to me!,91412,5
91412,I was one of 5 bridesmaids that ordered from  Milano Bride.,91412,5
91412,We all ordered separately at different times.,91412,5
91412,Although we all received our dress in a fairly timely manner some did take longer to arrive than others.,91412,5
91412,After placing my order I received an email requesting my measurements and preference on a zip back or corset back.,91412,5
91412,I sent in my measurements and asked for the corset back.,91412,5
91412,One of the other girls did not send in her measurements and got her dress in standard sizing.,91412,5
91412,My dress fit beautifully while the other bridesmaid needed some additional altering.,91412,5
91412,Also since we all ordered separately there was some confusion where one of the dresses arrived with a zip back instead of corset.,91412,5
91412,That particular bridesmaid contacted the company and they exchanged the dress with no major issue that I heard of.,91412,5
91412,As for the quality of the dress I was highly impressed!,91412,5
91412,I'll be honest we were leary about ordering our dresses online but working on a tight budget it was our best option.,91412,5
91412,Don't be confused these ARE custom made dresses.,91412,5
91412,The construction of the dress was very good.,91412,5
91412,It even came with some extra  built in support which was nice.,91412,5
91412,Since we had 5 different body types I was surprised that we all looked nice in the dress but we did.,91412,5
91412,"The color for all dresses were a good match as I know they were not all cut from the same bolt of fabric As for the fabric itself, it was of high quality.",91412,5
91412,Not cheap feeling or costumey.,91412,5
91412,Since the dresses arrive in a bag we took them in to have them professionally pressed and on weddings day we all looking beautiful!,91412,5
91413,I am very happy with these harem pants!,91413,5
91413,Great for staying cool and comfy.,91413,5

91743,I give this a 5 star for the quality you get and the amount of sets you get.,91743,5

92064,"I have worn it once, and I received compliments both at work and at school the day and night I wore it.",92064,5
92064,The gold is eye-catching and the shirt is soft and comfortable.,92064,5

92065,Fits perfectly and the fabric is soft is it slides on an off so easily.,92065,5
92065,Quality of the fabric is superb!,92065,5
92066,Very pleased with the quality and the look of the pajamas.,92066,5
92067,I ordered this tie for my husband in mind.,92067,5
92067,"It's not often that he dresses up, but he has some interviews in the near future.",92067,5
92067,"Since he doesn't really hand any nice ties, I ordered this one with very little knowledge as to what to what kind to order.",92067,5
92067,I ordered silver because I felt like it would match most of what he wears.,92067,5
92067,I can say that I was surprised at the quality of this tie.,92067,5
92067,It's soft and thick.,92067,5
92067,Not like the itchy department store ties.,92067,5

92067,I found it really nice and so did my husband.,92067,5
92067,"I have no complaints , and would order other colors if we find the need.",92067,5

92071,This corset is exactly what I wanted.,92071,5
92071,"I love the fit, the support,the comfort and durability.",92071,5
92071,"I was a bit sceptical at first, having bought so many other brands which were very expensive and didn't fit or were poorly designed for curvaceous women like me.",92071,5
92071,So I decided to go a little bit cheaper and purchased this corset exactly my actual size and was surprised to see that it fitted perfectly but on the third row of hooks.,92071,5
92071,I have been losing weight and was just looking for an affordable and firm corset to start my waist training.,92071,5
92071,It immediately reduced my waistline and push-up my bust giving me that sexy hour glass figure that I sought.,92071,5
92071,"Although it does not roll up and stays in place, I wear a high waist panty girdle over it to complete the look, being that I have a large bottom.",92071,5
92071,I ordered a second unit to switch to as the first one would become too large to proceed with my waist training regimen.,92071,5
92071,"Went from 8X (size 24-26)- using the third hook on first try, To a 6X (size 20- 22) using the 2nd hook on first try.",92071,5
92071,Waist training can be very costly but this corset is affordable and reasonably priced.,92071,5
92071,I will definitely be buying a third one soon.,92071,5
92071,Highly recommend this corset to anyone looking for a great quality corset that provides firm support with breathable comfort at a sweet price.,92071,5
92072,Fits,92072,5

92075,"I was able to fit a key, lip gloss, a Galaxy S7, and a couple credit cards in it if I angled them all just right.",92075,5
92075,"The sides have a smooth finish and don't snag my chiffon dress, which surprised me some it's covered in stones.",92075,5
92075,It catches the light well and is so sparkly; I can't wait to use it at an upcoming military ball.,92075,5

92086,This is such a pretty bracelet..,92086,5
92086,"It's about 33"" long and though it's great for a necklace for me, it's too long to wrap around my wrist as a bracelet - 4 wraps is too loose and 5 wraps is stretching the cord too tight.",92086,5
92086,AmorWing offered to make a special one a little shorter to fit me!!,92086,5
92086,How awesome is that??,92086,5

92095,"However, it doesn't feel uncomfortable nor does it bothers me as I use them throughout my workouts.",92095,5

92299,but it got here super fast,92299,5

92432,"I found these, read the reviews and decided to give them a try; who would pass up 100 tongue rings for $3?!?",92432,5
92432,They arrived very quickly and I traded the one I had in out for a complete new one from the bag (I was a little hesitant about changing the metal too but decided to wing it) and a week in I have to say I'm impressed!,92432,5

92448,A fantastic tie.,92448,5

92460,Was the biggest hit at Christmas!,92460,5
92461,I truly love this top and shipping was super quick.,92461,5
92461,"But....I am consistently a S/M in top sizes and ordered a Large due to other reviewers' recommendations, and the Large fits as a Medium normally would.",92461,5
92461,"With that said, I'm glad I read the reviews because this top is too adorable.",92461,5
92461,"Good overall length and the sleeves are long too, which I like.",92461,5
92461,I would recommend this top but just keep in mind you might want to order a size up for the top to fit and look on you as it does on the model in the picture.,92461,5
92462,Beautiful!,92462,5
92462,Fits true to size!!,92462,5

92468,Genuine high quality slim wallet.,92468,5

92469,I ordered 4 tank tops 2 different times.,92469,5
92470,It's a nice color buy most importantly  it's big enough to hold my large note 3 plus my portable phone charger and still shuts closed with no issue.,92470,5
92470,Great for my assassin's creed Cosplay to hold my wallet and other personal items.,92470,5
92471,Got this shirt for my boyfriend to wear to an ugly sweater party.,92471,5
92471,It was a big hit he got lots of compliments on it.,92471,5
92471,Fit great was good quality.,92471,5
92472,A Christmas gift.,92472,5
92472,It was loved by my niece,92472,5
92473,Excellent jacket and about as close to my old Government Issue M-65 field jacket as possible.,92473,5
92473,"Should withstand many, many years of hard use.",92473,5
92473,"While not a ""fashion statement"", this coat has utilitarian good looks and will never go out of ""style"".",92473,5
92473,"A warm, durable coat, with four large pockets and a built-in wind hood will always be practicality defined, at least as far as cool/cold weather coats go.",92473,5
92473,The material is 50% nylon and 50% cotton and feels like it would be warm enough without the liner down into the low 40's for a long time outdoors.,92473,5
92473,"In winter, I spend a fair bit of time in Northern Arizona and it can get very cold/snowy there at 7,000 to 9,500 feet and with the liner this coat should keep me warm well below the 30's, and even lower still if coupled with a good wool or heavy flannel shirt (wool being the better choice).",92473,5
92473,The main zipper appears to be very tough and the snaps require a relatively firm push to get them to engage so they won't pop open unintentionally.,92473,5
92473,The hood zipper is similarly well constructed.,92473,5
92473,Stitching is very close together - first thing I looked at.,92473,5
92473,Quality job there.,92473,5
92473,There are actually two drawstrings inside the coat.... one inside at waist and one lower at the bottom hem of the jacket.,92473,5
92473,"(Regarding the drawstring at the bottom of the coat, make sure you tie several knots into the tag end (it is elasticized/stretchable, as opposed to the upper waist drawstring which isn't.",92473,5
92473,I didn't tie those knots and during washing/drying process one side worked it's way into the coat.,92473,5
92473,Took a LONG while to work it back though to the other side).,92473,5
92473,The two drawstrings should keep out even the worst wind.,92473,5
92473,Nice touch.,92473,5
92473,"All in all, this jacket is very well made and worth every penny.",92473,5
92473,I bought the O.D.,92473,5
92473,green but may even get another in khaki.,92473,5
92473,"Now, onto size - Alpha Industries needs to accurately redefine the sizes of their M-65 coats.",92473,5
92473,"These coats, as mentioned by nearly everyone, do run LARGE.",92473,5
92473,"I'm 5'9"", 42-44"" chest, 36-38"" waist and weigh 181 pounds.",92473,5
92473,I wear a size large in  nearly everything.,92473,5
92473,"I bought the medium size and after trying it on for the first time, thought I *might* have been better off getting a size small.",92473,5
92473,I decided to take a chance and wash it in hot water it to see if I could shrink it up a bit seeing as it's 50% cotton.,92473,5
92473,"With it being 50% nylon, as expected, it didn't shrink a lot, but it did shrink enough to make it pretty much a perfect fit either with or without the liner.",92473,5
92473,"Unlike some reviewers, I do not think using a liner would require increasing the size field jacket one should purchase - the sizes run that large.",92473,5
92473,"Coats like this, designed for cool/cold weather should be worn a bit loose, to allow for layering and trapping warm the air inside the coat.",92473,5
92473,"Had I bought a size small, I suspect it might have proven to be too small and tight.",92473,5
92473,"Tight fitting field jackets, with liner or not, won't keep you as warm as a looser fit will.",92473,5
92473,"That said, if you're 5'9"", weigh 150-160 pounds and have a 32"" waist, a medium will be too large.",92473,5
92473,"The sleeves, like everything about this coat, run long as well.",92473,5
92473,"There is a Velcro tab that allows a portion of the sleeve to be rolled into the the end of the sleeve and attached to it's Velco mating tab, but it is still a just bit long, which to my mind is better than too short.",92473,5
92473,Sometimes an item comes along that is just a really high quality product... like the Yeti cooler or the Nikon D-810 camera... and I expect the Alpha Industries Men's M-65 Field Coat is one of them.,92473,5
92473,"Generally speaking, I don't review products that I haven't used for several weeks/months.",92473,5
92473,"In the case of this jacket, after careful inspection, I'm comfortable in giving coat this five stars having having received it just today.",92473,5
92474,One of my favorites from this year's crop of flannel gowns.,92474,5
92474,"The V neck is really nice, except when it is really cold",92474,5
92475,"Every time I put them on the black top, keeps on rolling down on me!!!",92475,5
92475,"That's the only thing that keeps on happening, but I have been loving them on myself!!",92475,5
92475,!,92475,5
92476,My daughter loves it!,92476,5
92477,Fast shipping.,92477,5

92480,The colors are beautiful and it's so unique.,92480,5
92480,Be prepared for people to ask where you got it.,92480,5

92489,"than pictured -- but honestly, I didn't even notice until I got on here to write this review.",92489,5
92489,"Fits as expected, but don't be afraid to go up a size if you want a looser fit -- Ii don't think you can go wrong!",92489,5

92490,"How can I say more, perfect fit, really accented my model.",92490,5

92499,Recommended,92499,5
92500,fits my body right,92500,5
92501,"While I did rate it as expected, it is just a hair tighter in the bust than I normally like.",92501,5
92501,"Is it tooo tight, not quite, but almost!",92501,5
92501,"Other than that, this is a great work/casual wear top.",92501,5

93642,It came way earlier than expected (a week or 2) and was not damaged at all.,93642,5
93642,"The wool like fabric was slightly bent but it reformed perfectly, as it is not a hard hat.",93642,5

93657,Arrived on time and in perfect condition!,93657,5
93658,The joy on my daughter's face when she opened this was beyond worth it.,93658,5
93658,"This is a great price for the suit and she couldn't be happier wearing this to the pool (and sometimes around the house just because)  The tail has an opening so walking is easy though it's a snug fit around the legs so they sort of waddle (it's hilarious trust me)
Little one is roughly 37 inches tall and the tail gives about 10 inches of extra fabric for taller children.",93658,5
93658,She is a skinny little thing so the bathing suit sags but the elastic keeps it in place on her hips where it belongs.,93658,5
93658,The triangle top can be a bit tricky if they do a lot of hopping around in the water only because it comes up without anything to hold it in place.,93658,5
93658,All in all i would recommend 100% and I plan on buying her the other colors.,93658,5
93658,"I can't comment on shipping because I paid to have it overnighted, but the packaging was in tact and well sealed when we got it.",93658,5

93662,A little shorter than expected but cute.,93662,5
93663,"With a little extra behind the hatband, it's perfect.",93663,5

93664,Perfect fit and love the feel,93664,5
93665,It made her engagement ring sparkle.,93665,5
93666,This is my 1st time ordering from this company.,93666,5
93666,The quality is great.,93666,5
93666,Fits true to size (in US sizes) and my son loves it.,93666,5
93667,Everything was perfect,93667,5
93668,I have been thru about 4 or 5 western style belts .,93668,5
93668,Some were too loud ( too many studs or stones ) and some were just too plain .,93668,5
93668,I saw this particular belt online and I immediately ordered .,93668,5
93668,What was kind of a drag was they did not have my belt size that I normally wear ( size 36 ) .,93668,5
93668,So I went with the next size up ( size 38 ) and couldn't be happier that I did .,93668,5
93668,Fits and feels great !,93668,5
93668,!!,93668,5
93668,If there was a downside I would say just be careful when putting your belt on .,93668,5
93668,"Sometimes when you are weaving it thru the belt loops , it tends to ""snag"" on a loop or 2 .",93668,5
93668,It won't break or anything like that but I guess if you yanked or pulled really hard you might loose a loop on your jeans .,93668,5
93668,But there shouldn't be a need for that kind of behavior .,93668,5
93668,"( gotta smile there )
So far - this by far is my favorite western style belt .",93668,5
93668,( I always remove the original belt buckle and attach my 4 x 5 rounded roping buckle .,93668,5
93668,( Not a championship -- I didn't earn that --- just a nice standard roping buckle by Crumrine ).,93668,5
93669,i love it (ordered 2 by mistake) but it fits just right good to wear for hunting or any outdoor activity,93669,5
93670,love it so soft and didn't shrink at all washed it about 10 times already,93670,5
93671,"I am 5'1"" 140ish lbs and I ordered XXL.",93671,5
93671,Which I am normally a M or L. I NEVER wear XXL.,93671,5
93671,But it fit like a glove.,93671,5
93671,Slightly snug on butt but super cute and flattering.,93671,5
93671,I can wear it with friends and my kids!,93671,5
93672,Nice belt for the price,93672,5
93673,I can't express enough how gorgeous these beads are!,93673,5
93673,The colors are all so vibrant and they all look so uniform in size.,93673,5
93673,"I've had other beads that were the same size in their own color, but there was a noticeable size difference in other colors.",93673,5
93673,The end result didn't look very nice due to the various sizes.,93673,5
93673,These are going to be so easy to work with for a more professional result.,93673,5
93673,I will definitely purchase more in the future.,93673,5
93674,My husbands favorite underwear ... hands down.,93674,5
93675,I am OBSESSED with this phone case!,93675,5
93675,It came 2 days earlier and I'm very pleased with how it looks.,93675,5
93675,I can tell it's very durable and the design still allows you to see the color of your phone.,93675,5
93675,I purchased a pink case and it suits perfectly with my rose gold.,93675,5
93675,"Definitely buying another one for my mom, she seems jealous of my new case tbh",93675,5
93676,Just what I needed,93676,5
93677,Fits very nice.,93677,5
93677,Love it.,93677,5
93677,Not open crotch but still very nice.,93677,5

93679,Beautiful going to order more en different colors.,93679,5
93679,Love the material.,93679,5
93680,"This looks really great, I love the way it lays, would definitely recommend buying it, I ordered the black lace, also ordered the tan lace and pretty pleased with that one as well.",93680,5
93681,"Super cute, works great, all my cards fit, has plenty of storage, zipper pocket for change is perfect, and did I mention it is SUPER cute!",93681,5
93682,The watch is very nice looking.,93682,5
93682,It shows accurate time.,93682,5
93683,These undercrackers (tm a friend) are fantastic.,93683,5
93683,"Good, basic cotton undies that won't ride up your bum and make you increasingly irritable as the interval between bathroom breaks drags on, or leave you trying to discreetly pick a wedgie on an elevator just as your boss walks on.",93683,5
93683,It's like the doors know and open faster.,93683,5
93683,"Anyway, they don't dig or emphasize muffin top because the waistband is wide and comfortable.",93683,5
93683,The leg openings are similarly non-constricting.,93683,5
93683,"They are breathable, they are simple, they are the Panties for Today's Practical Woman.",93683,5
93683,Buy some.,93683,5
93683,"Their one drawback is that, because of the wide, non-elastic waistband, they tend to stretch out at the top if you lose and gain weight during the course of a month.",93683,5
93683,"Mine are still holding up even after some late-pregnancy use, but I can see that they will need to be replaced soon.",93683,5
93683,"Less annoying than a hole between the elastic and the fabric, though.",93683,5
93683,"No, I am not adding a photo.",93683,5
93684,"It's not blurry or anything the texture is really nice, I love it.",93684,5

93794,At the time of writing this review I now own 4 pairs of Youth sized Vibram and I have to say I prefer the fit to the Adult sizes.,93794,5
93794,Generally I wear a 40 in Women's or a 39 in Men's in most styles of Vibrams.,93794,5
93794,As sizing varies between the models they often have been too spacious in the toes for me.,93794,5
93794,However I have consistently felt that the youth sizing Vibram are better fit and the price makes them totally worth it!,93794,5
93794,"I order a size 41 in the Youth and they fit like a glove, the fact that I've never spent more than twenty bucks on a pair makes it even better!",93794,5
93794,I do have to say that the Youth models have the most basic KSO sole which has very little traction so if you're looking for Vibrams with soles made for hiking or heavier wear I wouldn't choose these.,93794,5
93794,However these are great for both gym and casual wear!,93794,5
93794,I love them and will be getting more!,93794,5

93799,"I know when I start experiencing pain, I wish they were made of hard plastic and lasted longer.",93799,5
93799,I have a pair in every pair of shoes I own.,93799,5

94054,I have custom inserts but they never quite work with these boots.,94054,5

94054,The boots in question have a 1 3/4 inch heel.,94054,5
94054,While my orthotics work sublimely in flat shoes but just not in my coveted Frye boots.,94054,5

94055,"I am a large woman, I worried that these pants wouldn't fit.",94055,5
94055,"In fact, they did, and are super comfortable!",94055,5

94278,But the smell goes away in a day.,94278,5
94278,Even though it doesn't have a zip I don't feel worried about things falling out as the shape of the bag makes the magnetic closure sufficient.,94278,5

94286,My son has been wearing them for fun since they're not a part of his wedding attire but he has a hard time keeping them on his shoulders.,94286,5

94818,"A word about sizing, since some of the other reviews had me confused.",94818,5
94818,"It fits true to size, but you need to remember that the top is SUPPOSED to be snug-fitting like a thermal top.",94818,5
94818,"If your child has a huskier build, then you may want to go up a size, but in that case then the pants might be too long.",94818,5
94818,"If your child is between sizes or you're debating between two sizes then I recommend going for the larger size just to be safe, but I wouldn't go purposely a size up purely to compensate for what people are saying.",94818,5
94818,I did that and now my older has to wear the PJ's I had intended for my younger son!,94818,5
94818,I'd sum it up by saying this style suits average or slender builds.,94818,5
94818,My sons are tall and slender and this fits just great.,94818,5
94818,"If my child was husky though I would probably go with a totally different style of PJ since then the top would be too snug or the pants too long, depending on what size you go for.",94818,5
94818,"One other item of note: the elastic waist is not too tight or too loose on my sons, an important factor for comfort.",94818,5
94818,The style and feel of these PJ's was very popular with my son.,94818,5
94818,"These are great PJ's for pajama parties or pajama day at school - comfy, trendy original designs that don't look exactly like what every other kid has already.",94818,5
94819,Beautiful,94819,5
94820,I bought these as a gift.,94820,5
94820,I can't comment on the fit but they are so cute and look thick and well made.,94820,5
94821,This is probably one of the best purchases I've made on amazon.,94821,5
94821,"It's absolutely adorable, and very well made, although there is no guarantee your children will wear it.",94821,5
94821,I bought it for my little brothers and ended up wearing it myself!,94821,5
94821,It will definitely stretch to fit an adult.,94821,5

94825,I am just a woman who needs a little extra support.,94825,5
94825,"I just thought that if a woman who went through (or is going through) child birth could help get back in shape using something like this, maybe it could help me.",94825,5
94825,"I'm not size ""2"", in fact I have flab and loose skin to spare.",94825,5
94825,I suffer from saggy skin ever since I started getting into shape and changing my old ways for better ones.,94825,5
94825,"but as the pounds start to shed, the skin starts to fall.",94825,5
94825,It's a sad yet happy reality.,94825,5
94825,I have tried this shaper one and I really love the results it gives.,94825,5
94825,"I'm not going to lie, the shaper I choose is a bit tight.",94825,5
94825,"not too much, just a bit.",94825,5
94825,But I think that has to do with my selection.,94825,5
94825,I assumed a smaller size would benefit me when in fact I should have just ordered larger.,94825,5
94825,"Nevertheless, this shaper is really good.",94825,5
94825,Perfect for getting your body back into shape.,94825,5

94825,It helps smooth back your belly and tame that muffin top.,94825,5
94825,Its comfortable enough to wear anywhere.,94825,5
94825,soft and durable to provide the needed support.,94825,5
94825,"The fabric is silky and smooth, extremely breathable and of nice quality.",94825,5
94825,"I know this isn't a magic article of clothing, I know I will have to learn to tone myself back up but this is a great way to start.",94825,5
94825,"If not anything, then at least for the mindset of getting back into shape.",94825,5
94825,"All in all, a very wonderful shaper!",94825,5
94825,"Fit for everyone--With baby, without baby, just in need of some much needed support!",94825,5

94930,I'm a size 32.,94930,5
94930,"After cutting at the pre-marked lines, the belt turned out to be quite short.",94930,5

94941,These are slightly thicker and feel stronger than previous leather laces I've had from Whites Boots etc...,94941,5
94941,I'm hoping they're tough enough to hold up to the very short radius bend induced by the d-rings on the La Sportivas.,94941,5
94942,I really like these but they are very expensive for flip flops.,94942,5
94942,They are beautiful to look at and really are comfortable to wear...BUT I would not pay this price for another pair,94942,5

95027,So much cheaper than most of the outfits and he couldn't have looked any cuter.,95027,5
95028,It is very well made ''coat.,95028,5
95028,There's just a little problem with the sleeves.,95028,5
95028,They are a bit tight.,95028,5
95029,Was just what we wanted.,95029,5

95037,The delivery was rapid.,95037,5
95037,I am super excited about my pants.,95037,5
95037,The fit is perfect and that's a huge plus because normally I can fit pants in the waist but not in the hips.,95037,5
95037,I ordered a 2x and they fit exactly like it should.,95037,5
95037,I am 5'5 and the pants come right at the bottom of my feet.,95037,5
95037,"So, wedges would be ideal but I think I can get away with some flats; pants will get a little dirty though because they are right to the bottom of my feet.",95037,5
95037,I recommend for anyone that have a problem finding pants to fit their thigh/hip area.,95037,5

95040,"My granddaughter is tiny and the shorts were a little big, but I think that means they would fit as expected because all shorts are big on her!",95040,5
95040,This is the perfect little summer outfit with the little matching headband.,95040,5
95041,"So this is my second pregnancy and I'm halfway now, but totally still have that flappy skin on my tummy from my son (who was a big baby and I had polyhydraminos which didn't help).",95041,5
95041,So I was surprised this pregnancy when I formed this really awkward looking bump.,95041,5
95041,Maternity pants with the high waistbands where my only help in looking like I'm actually pregnant and not just deformed lol.,95041,5
95041,But I only have so many pairs of maternity pants and there are so many pairs of pants that I miss wearing.,95041,5
95041,"So anyway, the Bella band is perfect for me not just holding up pants that don't button anymore but also holding the bottom part of my bump up to make my bump look less awkward.",95041,5
95041,It sounds dumb but I swear it's been such a great thing to have.,95041,5
95041,I recommend it to every pregnant woman even though I've never heard of anyone else using it for the reason that I do lol,95041,5

95042,There is an adjustable strap on both sides of the back by the fastener to make it snug to your rib size.,95042,5
95042,"I did not include a picture, but the blue bikini straps fasten in the back with flat hook hardware.",95042,5
95042,"The first time I put it on it slipped out, but I bent the metal closed so that this would not happen again.",95042,5

95052,I bought them for my 4 year old who loves to lose earrings and somehow smashes them while they are still in her ear.,95052,5
95052,I was worried about the gauge being too big but these are not much bigger than a regular earrings!,95052,5

95163,It doesn't come laced up.,95163,5
95163,The string is on the side so I used tweezers to thread the string through the holes.,95163,5
95163,It's not a big deal but I was to eager to try it on and it was a little tedious to lace it up myself.,95163,5

95372,"This makes it very difficult to find a bathing suit that fits (I'm for reference, I'm 5'10"" and a size 4/6 with a 30F bra size) but doesn't show my tummy and upper thighs.",95372,5
95372,I've tried a lot of swim dresses and they never seemed long enough to cover the very tops of my thighs and the chest was almost always too small.,95372,5
95372,"I can deal with that as long as it supports the girls, but because I am so tall, the bust is usually pretty low.",95372,5
95372,I can't find two piece bottoms that either are high enough to conceal the worst of my loose skin or that cover my upper thighs (I can get one but not both).,95372,5
95372,I tell you all of this so you can understand that I have searched high and low for a swimsuit I feel comfortable in.,95372,5
95372,This suit is awesome.,95372,5
95372,"First of all, it is long enough to cover my upper thighs, which are thick, without digging into them.",95372,5
95372,It's not so long that it looks prudish.,95372,5
95372,The body of the suit is very comfortable.,95372,5
95372,The halter brings the cups high enough to provide great support.,95372,5
95372,"My chest doesn't QUITE fit, but it's close enough.",95372,5
95372,I would guess that someone with a larger band size and a D or even a large C would fit better.,95372,5
95372,"You definitely do need boobs, though.",95372,5
95372,It won't work for small chested women.,95372,5
95372,"I wear a 4/6 in pants and bought this in a 6/8, since swimsuits tend to run small.",95372,5
95372,The suit was very comfortable and plenty roomy so I would say that someone who is a 6/8 could wear it comfortably.,95372,5
95372,One thing to note is that the body is pretty long.,95372,5
95372,I don't think this suit will work for short women.,95372,5
95372,"I am 5'10"" and this probably had an inch or two more length in the torso than even I needed.",95372,5
95372,"Bottom line, though?",95372,5
95372,This is the first suit I have ever felt even remotely confident wearing.,95372,5
95372,"It's not perfect, but I love it.",95372,5
95373,LOVE these pants.,95373,5
95373,Super breathable material but they aren't see-through at all.,95373,5
95373,I ordered an XL which is my usual size and they are perfect.,95373,5
95373,Also the color is just like the picture.,95373,5
95373,Bright and vibrant,95373,5
95374,Pretty little bonnet!,95374,5
95375,I bought this for my fiance and she absolutely loved it....,95375,5
95376,"small and compact, just right size for credit cards and drivers license",95376,5
95377,Simple.,95377,5
95377,"But, practical.",95377,5
95377,It actually holds me in well.,95377,5
95378,"Its very comfortable, and nice.",95378,5
95379,"Super flattering, makes your stomach look flat af",95379,5
95380,"I have to say, the hype is real.",95380,5
95380,These are incredibly soft and incredibly comfortable.,95380,5
95380,"Pros:
-The quality and feel of the material lives way up to the hype, so soft that it really feels like you have no underwear on at all.",95380,5
95380,-I was a bit skeptical about the 'pouch' that is featured but man is it amazing.,95380,5
95380,It really does hold everything in place and the material again is incredibly soft.,95380,5
95380,"-Price, I almost would label this as a con because they are a bit pricey, but if you can wait and find unpopular patterns on sale it is definitely worth it!",95380,5
95380,"Pattern doesn't matter, all that does is how comfortable these are.",95380,5
95380,"Cons:
- After a few weeks of regular wear I have noticed the legs starting to ride up just a little throughout the day.",95380,5
95380,- There is no fly for easy access when using the bathroom.,95380,5
95380,It is a small inconvenience though considering the quality and comfort overall,95380,5
95381,It's nice that there's a little room to grow.,95381,5
95382,Very well made,95382,5

95383,I ordered her the large and it fit nicely.,95383,5
95384,Pretty good.,95384,5
95384,"Nice quality, doesn't seem cheap.",95384,5
95384,Very nice.,95384,5
95384,The Small top is 32B.,95384,5
95384,"The bottom is tight, but not to the point it's extremely uncomfortable.",95384,5
95384,I'm sure in water it becomes perfect.,95384,5
95385,I have had these insoles before they are just what I need for work since I have calluses on the balls of my feet and 2  morons neuroma surgeries.,95385,5
95385,I am a bartender and could not work without these insoles!!!!,95385,5

95389,"It is just an ""H"" buckle that comes with a colored belt of your choosing.",95389,5
95389,It still looks great and it doesn't fade.,95389,5
95390,Soft and comfy,95390,5

95541,I ordered size 3X and I'm 42D bra size.,95541,5

95541,It fits great now and I can't wait to wear it!,95541,5

95565,I had also bought them to draw a design on and they worked really well for that.,95565,5
95565,The edging had some glue of some kind which was a little difficult to draw over with fabric marker and the colour did change a little there but it is nothing to be concerned about.,95565,5

95581,The sequins are nice and sewn well.,95581,5

95936,The cut is tailored enough though that it doesn't look sloppy.,95936,5

95952,This is a wonderful skort.,95952,5
95952,It actually becomes more loose as time goes on so you might want to take that into account when ordering size.,95952,5
95952,"However, the hip portion remains true to size (unlike waist that can stretch).",95952,5
95952,"It is soft, comfortable, cool, and is at my knee (I'm 5'2"" and size 18).",95952,5

96225,"It is not at all sheer, yet you can feel the breeze through the fabric on your skin.",96225,5
96225,It is perfect for very warm weather.,96225,5
96225,I wore it to an afternoon birthday party last week and received so many compliments.,96225,5
96225,"Compared to others that I have tried, this is a find.",96225,5
96225,The only issue is be careful with the sizing.,96225,5
96225,Small is a UK 8-10.,96225,5
96225,"They tell you this, which is why I can't complain about it.",96225,5
96225,I am 53 and 118lbs and wear a size US 4.,96225,5
96225,But small is the smallest they have.,96225,5
96225,The length of the small with a little heel is perfect.,96225,5
96225,It has a belt which takes care of any oversize in that area without any indication of it being oversized.,96225,5
96225,"It is not skin tight, which I am happy about but not at all baggy either.",96225,5
96225,The top was a little big and I put a few stitches under the arms and it is perfect.,96225,5
96225,"I was willing to alter a bit, it took 10 minutes to do, rather than return due to the very reasonable price and that I loved it compared to others I had tried.",96225,5
96225,"Also, it says black and white Aztec.",96225,5
96225,I thought the white would be white but it is a beautiful light cream color.,96225,5
96226,These boxer briefs are my new favorite.,96226,5
96226,I previously had a style that Jockey made was was incredible but has since been discontinued and so these are my new go to.,96226,5
96226,I live in Florida and so heat and humidity are a normal part of daily life and cotton in boxers for me is a killer.,96226,5
96226,The material composition of these are perfect as they breath great but are also not to thick or even to thin.,96226,5
96226,I play soccer in these and go to the gym (crossfit) and have no complaints.,96226,5
96226,The waist band is also great because it has good stretch so that it doesn't cut off circulation and has a good hold on my waist.,96226,5
96226,The length of the legs are also great because I'm pretty picky when it comes to that.,96226,5
96226,I have previously spent a lot of money on Trunk boxer briefs with short legs that usually end up turning into just briefs by riding up my leg.,96226,5
96226,I have decently muscular legs but not huge so these are really in line with what I needed.,96226,5
96226,"I give these boxers my highest recommendation as I stated, I can't stand cotton in my boxer briefs.",96226,5
96226,"Whether I'm heading to the gym or just going to dinner, these are what I wear.",96226,5
96227,It is an amazing outfit!,96227,5
96227,I am an expecting mom and I am in the time where I look chubby instead of pregnant.,96227,5
96227,This dress fit so nice around the breast area and loose all the way down that it made me look amazing!,96227,5
96228,I got this for my boyfriend for valentines day and he loves it!,96228,5
96228,It's very sturdy and holding up very well.,96228,5

96229,It is a very sturdy cover for your luggage.,96229,5
96229,Dimensions are as advertised.,96229,5
96229,I have used this on one round trip adventure.,96229,5
96229,Three airport each leg.,96229,5
96229,It held up with no cuts.,96229,5
96229,More importantly the luggage was untouched and clean under the cover.,96229,5
96230,This ring looks like a much more expensive one.,96230,5
96230,"I paired it with a 3 stone diamond ring, and was very impressed.",96230,5
96230,The platinum plating is thick enough not to rub off and it keeps the ring from tarnishing.,96230,5
96230,It looks as good as the day I bought it.,96230,5
96231,Il be looking great for halloween,96231,5

96235,"The handbag is beautiful, and I got the last one in pink.",96235,5
96235,It is made of quality.,96235,5
96235,"The problem I had though was that the handles were broken off the bag, but luckily I was able to super glue them back on.",96235,5
96235,And you can not tell at all that I had to fix the handle.,96235,5
96235,"The seller offered to send me a replacement, but I decided to keep this one.",96235,5
96235,I will order more in other colors.,96235,5

96395,These are my first pair of Fly London shoes.,96395,5
96395,"I never heard of Fly London before but I notice that Nordstrom carries this brand, so they are definitely not on the ""budget"" end if you are shopping under the $100 price tag (can be pricey - got these at a good price compared to the other colors they come in at $179).",96395,5
96395,"The ""FLY"" logo on the shoe can be a turnoff (corny) but not that noticeable because these are in off white (manufactures/designers have a need to put a signature stamp on fashion these days).",96395,5
96395,I was tempted to skip ordering them after asking my daughter if she like the style (a quick NO with a head shake...she's 23).,96395,5

I have been looking for a nice beach towel that was pretty to look at and was good quality.",96405,5
96405,This beach towel hit the nail on the head for both of those items.,96405,5
96405,"After receiving the towel, my family took a trip to the beach where I received a ton of compliments on its appearance.",96405,5
96405,I agree it is beautiful but that's not my favorite thing about this towel.,96405,5
96405,The quality is great!,96405,5
96405,It is thick enough to soak up water when you are drying off but not so thick that it becomes extremely heavy or won't dry.,96405,5
96405,"In addition, the size is just right as it covers a chaise lounge chair well.",96405,5
96405,Since purchasing this item I have washed it many many times and the beach towel still looks the same as the day I bought it.,96405,5
96405,It does not shrink or fade.,96405,5

96405,Each person that I have given one to inevitably calls me to tell me how much they loved it after using it.,96405,5
96405,"My husband and I own a pool and, therefore, we own many beach towels.",96405,5
96405,This is by far my favorite.,96405,5

96408,"I bout this in the soft pink and it's exactly the color that appears here, and is sturdy made.",96408,5

96408,"It's perfect, and I want one in every color now!",96408,5
96409,Product itself is described very well on the pictures.,96409,5
96409,There really isn't too much going on here as it really is a very small piece of clothing.,96409,5
96409,It is however a very sexy piece.,96409,5
96409,The material feels nice and elastic and the little handcuffs are a nice touch.,96409,5

96411,"""Plus Sized"" with a big bust.",96411,5
96411,"Because of this, shirts fit me a bit weird if they aren't cut right.",96411,5
96411,"I end up looking like my tummy sticks out further than my bust because I get this sort of ""tent"" effect going on.",96411,5
96411,"Needless to say, finding shirts that fit right is complicated.",96411,5
96411,But these shirts fit AMAZING!,96411,5
96411,"Funny story, I bought these the first time last year and was SO upset when they went out of stock!",96411,5

96411,I like to wear mine shirts when it's both cold and hot.,96411,5
96411,During the winter I wear them with a nice open sweater or cardigan...,96411,5
96411,Throwing a nice infinity scarf and you have an adorable outfit.,96411,5
96411,And then in the summer I wear the tshirt with some cute shorts and I am just ready to go!!!!,96411,5
96411,"If I was to compare the quality to another company, I would say that these t-shirts are in the same class as Gap, J-Crew, and Holster.",96411,5
96412,These are by far the most comfortable inserts I have used!,96412,5
96412,"I have flat feet and plantar faciitis, as well as posterior tibial tendinitis.",96412,5

96482,It is very roomy and flattering on a fuller figure.,96482,5
96482,It does not hang off of the shoulder like the picture.,96482,5

96492,I have since thrown all of my old cheap underwear away and will only being purchasing Saxx from now.,96492,5
96492,I would encourage anyone looking to buy the Fiesta over the Vibe to think twice.,96492,5
96492,I was used to wearing traditional boxer briefs and the Vibe just fit better.,96492,5
96492,I found the Fiesta to have too much fabric in the legs.,96492,5
96492,I am new to Saxx so I can't speak to the quality over time but I understand from those who have purchased them for years that they last.,96492,5
96492,"Even if you find a problem, Saxx warranties everything they sell for one year.",96492,5
96493,This under wear is the greatest.,96493,5

96498,They are light weight and comfortable and look very cute if you need to run outside or answer the door or something.,96498,5
96498,I'm usually between a medium and a large so I ordered a large and I was glad because they seem to run a little on the small side.,96498,5
96498,They don't shrink though.,96498,5

96505,I absolutely love this shirt.,96505,5
96505,I got it in the red/maroonish color.,96505,5
96505,I was pretty skeptical considering the fact that I have big boobs but small waist and what not but I got a size S and it fits great I was also worried it'd show way too much clevage but you can lace it up depending on how much you want to show.,96505,5
96505,Probably going to buy another in black!,96505,5
96506,"The medium is just over 29"" long from very top of neck to bottom.",96506,5

96506,"My current stats: 5'5"", bust just under 40"", hips just under 36"".",96506,5
96506,"The fabric is thin enough to wear in the summer, but not see-through at all in the black.",96506,5
96506,This is not clingy & there is more than enough room to hide belly fat.,96506,5
96506,"The dolman sleeves make room for larger busts, so I can go down a size.",96506,5
96506,It is so hard for me to find tops that look ok on me.,96506,5
96506,Most in the stores that fits my chest are made for hips 10-12 inches bigger than mine & look like maternity tops.,96506,5
96506,Others here on amazon have such a tight bottom band that belly fat is emphasized.,96506,5
96506,Allegra K tops seem to work better for me.,96506,5
96506,"My one complaint about some of them is that bra straps show at the neckline, so I have to fix that.",96506,5
96506,At least this neckline is very high & modest.,96506,5
96507,"Super cute, great packaging.",96507,5

96595,It really works to keep pants up and I like that you can either wear it over your belly or folded down.,96595,5

96596,They are quite comfy and spacious; you could use it for nightwear if you were so inclined.,96596,5
96596,"I wear these under my skirts and under shorts that are a little too ""sheer"" for my tastes - for skirts/shorts with shorter hems, I roll the waistband up on these since they would otherwise peek out from the bottoms.",96596,5

97010,"There's a lot to like about this belt, but I have one key complaint.",97010,5
97010,"Let's start off with the good: great color, soft pliable leather, and a nice buckle that compliments the leather.",97010,5
97010,"This belt is also easy to adjust, just unscrew the bolt, detach the buckle, cut off a little length, punch a new hole, and reassemble everything.",97010,5
97010,My complaint is that the screw and nut aren't great pieces of hardware.,97010,5
97010,Both pieces of the chicago screw/sex bolt are too short.,97010,5
97010,"The ample thickness of the leather prevents the screw pieces from fully engaging, so only a handful of threads interlock.",97010,5
97010,"This caused my screw to strip, rendering the belt temporarily useless.",97010,5
97010,Luckily the seller was easy to contact and they sent me six sets of chicago screws so I could find the best match.,97010,5
97010,"I picked a longer screw/nut combo (which allows more threads to engage), but I would still prefer them to be longer and fit together more tightly.",97010,5
97010,"Overall though, I'm very happy with this belt so far.",97010,5
97010,The new screw is holding up perfectly fine.,97010,5
97010,"The belt looks great and the easy/discrete length adjustment is a huge boon for someone with a 29"" waist.",97010,5
97011,"Well made, great sparkle and pretty sapphire colored stone.",97011,5
97011,Good size too.,97011,5

97024,I LOVE this ring!!,97024,5
97024,"I'm pregnant and wanted something that looked similar to my wedding ring, and also would not turn my skin green or cause any allergic reactions... (I have issues with nickel in jewelry a lot).",97024,5
97024,I looked for several days to see what I could find and came across this ring.,97024,5
97024,"First of all, it's BEAUTIFUL!",97024,5
97024,My mom couldn't even tell it wasn't real!,97024,5
97024,"Second, it's made of stainless steel, so it's not turning my finger green or causing any allergic reactions on my finger, which is awesome!",97024,5
97024,My ONLY complaint (And it's really not a huge deal) is that the included wedding band sits higher than the diamonds that match on the main ring.,97024,5
97024,"It doesn't sit higher than the center stone or anything, just a little higher than the band of smaller diamonds on the main ring.",97024,5
97024,"This may not bug most people, but I'm kinda OCD and I like things to match... and this bugs me...",97024,5
97024,"HOWEVER, the main ring is so beautiful, and it's thicker by itself, so I just don't wear the wedding band with it, and it's fine.",97024,5
97024,No big deal.,97024,5
97024,"On days where I'm going to be cleaning all day, etc, I just throw on the wedding band by itself, so it still gets worn.",97024,5
97024,Very pretty set and I'm so glad I purchased!,97024,5

97884,Loved it!,97884,5
97885,This chain was purchased to replace one that was lost.,97885,5
97885,"It is a delicate, lightweight chain that is perfect for a gift for a little girl as it is only 12+inches long.",97885,5

97886,Top quality product!,97886,5
97886,"I was pleasantly surprised with the small size of the wallet and the fact that it can fit my cards, some cash, has a stash for emergency cash, and my second SIM card ( for when I travel ).",97886,5
97886,There's a point in your life when you realize that what you wear creates an immediate opinion from others about you.,97886,5
97886,"It determines how you are perceived in a business meeting, at the bank, at a restaurant, when on a date or when meeting new people.",97886,5
97886,"A wallet is one of the few accessories a man can use ( plus a watch, plus glasses if needed ) with out overdoing it with jewelry, or bracelets or things guys shouldn't really wear when older.",97886,5
97886,This wallet pushed me to sliming down my 16+ card wallet down to 8 plus cash while still having a rather small footprint.,97886,5
97886,"My recommendation is to definitely get a good slim wallet, as it shows that you are in control and organized.",97886,5
97886,"Not sure if this is the one for you but if you need more cards on you that most slims allow you to have, this is a really good option.",97886,5
97886,"I really hope this review is helpful for those on the fence of purchasing this, another bellroy, or another pricy wallet.",97886,5
97886,"Us men are normally price conscious and bellroys are not really that cheap, but once you have it, and knowing that you won't need to look at other wallets for a number of years is freeing.",97886,5
97886,"Like buying a good couch, or a good TV, you're just happy with the purchase.",97886,5

97975,I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis so it is nice to have stylish shoes to wear that won't cause me problems!,97975,5
97975,I will say to verify your shoe measurements with the chart by literally measuring your feet.,97975,5
97975,I normally wear 7 1/2 to an 8 depending on the shoe but every Vionic pair that I have ordered I wear a 7 and they fit perfectly.,97975,5

97979,"(button hole on each collar corner but no button on the collar, I'll sew one on someday when the Velcro stops working) The Velcro tab on each cuff is kind of small -- it would help if it was a little longer, but it works -- and the part it sticks to is large enough.",97979,5

97979,"Reviews of people my height and weight or slightly taller and heavier say everything from a small was too big, or just right even with a liner, to a large is actually what you do need.",97979,5
97979,I ordered a small first.,97979,5
97979,"It was not too small to wear, but it was snug with no liner and only a t-shirt.",97979,5
97979,I asked for a medium instead.,97979,5
97979,It was only very slightly larger.,97979,5
97979,"I can wear the medium (no liner) with a sweatshirt (hoodie, whatever) under it, but if I knew the sizing of another replacement would be consistent with these two I tried, I would prefer to have gotten a large per size charts on the product info page and the Alpha Industries chart provided in a reply to a customer question.",97979,5
97979,That person from Alpha Industries said to get one size smaller than your measurements.,97979,5
97979,Some people say go two sizes smaller in reviews.,97979,5
97979,Some say get the size you measure for.,97979,5
97979,"So there is no way to know for sure before it gets delivered, I guess.",97979,5
97979,"I might get a large now, and receive something way too big, so I'm going to keep the medium and try to avoid shrinking it when laundering it.",97979,5
97979,But I would rather have a large if it was sized consistently with the two I received so far.,97979,5
97980,Very pretty ring.,97980,5
97980,"I wear a size 6 & the 5 stones are a little too wide for my finger, but I will still wear it..",97980,5
97980,I wish it came in a 4 stone ring.,97980,5

98102,Product works great,98102,5
98103,I Love it but didn't need all this.,98103,5
98103,I made a bracelet with only charms so I didn't need all the extra plain links.,98103,5
98103,I would recommend just ordering the charms and the blank links you can get for a few dollars.,98103,5
98103,I paid too much for this and you can find sights for .50 cent to .95 cent charms.,98103,5

98381,We are very big Saddleback Leather fans.,98381,5
98381,This purse is our latest purchase.,98381,5
98381,Saddleback products are for people who appreciate the quality that every leather product ought to have.,98381,5
98381,We have otherwise become disgusted with how the leather product industry has cheapened along with other things in our culture.,98381,5
98381,"To me, ""old school"" is not wrong or bad; past generations seem to have cared a lot more about how their customers feel about their products, and how long their product lasted.",98381,5
98381,"Saddleback is right: Their products improve with use; the more ""patina,"" if any, the more valuable they become.",98381,5
98381,"They are both rugged, and easy to care for.",98381,5
98381,"This purse is a little bigger than I thought when I bought it, but my wife loves it.",98381,5
98381,I think Saddleback could prosper even more if they gave some additional attention to what more women need in a purse.,98381,5
98381,"Like, right-sizing, for what women usually need.",98381,5
98381,"Examples:

1.",98381,5
98381,"I think there needs to be a line of Saddleback purses sized in-between, that carries mainly just a big wallet and a big iPhone, a coin purse, and those other little things women carry.",98381,5
98381,"Saddleback's clutch purse is too small for the big iPhone and the women's big wallet, etc., while this satchel purse is too big, in my opinion.",98381,5
98381,My wife's opinion is that it is not too big; she absolutely loves it.,98381,5
98381,"She can even fit her Saddleback-covered iPad in this purse with everything else, although then the purse becomes too heavy, so she won't usually be carrying her iPad around in it.",98381,5
98381,2.,98381,5
98381,"Maybe Saddleback can take another look at the glorious latch mechanism, and come up with one more option that might be easier to open quickly with one hand.",98381,5
98381,"I hope Saddleback never goes away, and never falls into the cheapening process like so many other companies have (probably because most other companies are run by boards of greedy investors).",98381,5

98580,Fit great!,98580,5
98580,May be too big for smaller women but fits great for average sizes,98580,5
98581,Why did I wait so long to buy this dress?,98581,5
98581,Maybe because sweater dresses typically make me feel like I'm burning up and don't do a lot for me.,98581,5
98581,"Well, the reviews are right, this dress is awesome.",98581,5
98581,It was a toss up for me if I should get a medium or large based on people's reviews.,98581,5
98581,I'm a size 10 and decided to just use the size chart which recommends going by bust size so I did and picked a large.,98581,5
98581,The fit is perfect.,98581,5
98581,Clingy like in the picture but not super tight.,98581,5
98581,The dress is both comfortable and flattering.,98581,5
98581,"Material is soft and didn't make me feel hot, temperature wise, as soon as I put it on which sweater dresses often do.",98581,5
98581,I bought the black because I thought the grey might be less forgiving of wobbly bits.,98581,5
98581,The black hides that and it just looks great on.,98581,5

98644,This outfit was perfect.,98644,5
98644,I was really nervous because the other outfits that I read and looked at the reviews for were not at all what I was looking for!,98644,5
98644,"This one was, I would just get one size bigger then what you usually are.",98644,5
98644,The sizes tend to run a little smaller via reading reviews on it.,98644,5
98644,"So I went with a large, since I am usually a medium and it fit great!",98644,5
98645,I bought these to wear after my second c-section.,98645,5

98645,I am SO glad that I got them!,98645,5
98645,This panty was one of the best things I had after my c-section.,98645,5
98645,It fits comfortably and provides a good level of compression throughout the abdominal area.,98645,5
98645,I was afraid that it was going to hurt to wear these immediately after surgery but I started wearing mine as soon as I was released from the hospital (4 days PP) with no discomfort from the panty at all.,98645,5
98645,I was also concerned about the small silicone panel that is designed to cover the incision but it turned out that I didn't need to worry at all as that area is just as comfortable as the rest.,98645,5
98645,These have been especially nice to have at night when finding a comfortable sleeping position can be tricky.,98645,5
98645,I used these in a rotation with a postpartum support band and I feel like they were very helpful in achieving a smooth and speedy recovery.,98645,5
98645,"I am currently 4 weeks postpartum and now in the awkward ""my maternity pants are way too big but my pre-pregnancy pants are pretty tight"" stage, so I still wear these to help smooth everything out underneath my clothes for a better look and fit.",98645,5
98645,The high waist stays put and doesn't roll down or slip.,98645,5
98645,"Keep in mind that these are hand wash/line dry only, but they are very easy to wash and the material dries quickly.",98645,5
98645,"I followed the sizing guide provided by Upspring and went with the L/XL (I'm 5'4"" and a pre-preg size 12 AND managed to gain a good 40 lbs during pregnancy.",98645,5
98645,"I miss you already, carbs!)",98645,5

98672,I had planters facetious and was in a lot of discomfort.,98672,5
98672,The doctor recommended that I use these inserts and change my work shoes every 3 months.,98672,5
98672,He said no matter how much you pay for shoes the support breaks down after 3 months.,98672,5
98672,Best advice I've ever received.,98672,5
98672,I change my shoes every 3 months (only pay about $35 a pair now instead of $100 a pair ) and I use these inserts and change them every 6 months.,98672,5
98672,My Podiatrist charges $35 a pair for these inserts so this is a great price at amazon at $22.50.,98672,5

98684,"But as the swelling in my stomach went down I noticed the ""pudge"" Ive had since I had my children, was more noticeable.",98684,5
98684,The surgeon even said I would probably need a tummy tuck since the pudge would get more defined after having lipo.,98684,5
98684,Wrong!!!!,98684,5
98684,"After two weeks of using just the lipo foam I decided to try the board over the foam, under my compression garment.",98684,5

99155,"Comfortable, overlarge.",99155,5
99155,"The unremovable fleece lining is a bit warm so it is only really useful for cool weather, and because the fleece lining gives way to a less breathable lining in the sleeves, you will likely want to wear long sleeves under it.",99155,5

99161,"Great product, actually slightly larger than my military issued jacket which is also Medium regular.",99161,5

99328,I always get compliments on this shirt!,99328,5
99328,It has a high collar that comes to a point in the bash where it buttons down.,99328,5
99328,"The sleeves have a wide band with 2 buttons, I like to wear them folded up.",99328,5
99328,Great shirt and dirt cheap!,99328,5

99330,I got it so I can use the cross for a future Hellboy cosplay I want to do.,99330,5
99330,Would buy again.,99330,5
99331,Not too big but definitely has room to grow into it.,99331,5
99331,It completely covers te top of head ears and neck so no worry that those sensitive spots will get burnt.,99331,5
99331,It ties under the chin and has a toggle behind the back of head to snug up the cap so baby can't pull it off,99331,5
99332,Love these!,99332,5
99333,Watch the size chart.,99333,5
99333,Is true to the size.,99333,5
99333,"Big busted women, I would not recommend.",99333,5
99333,I like the bathing suit.,99333,5
99333,No muffin top.,99333,5
99333,Yayyy,99333,5
99334,Great size and fast delivery.,99334,5
99334,Very pleased with purchase.,99334,5
99335,Amazing product great for birthdays!,99335,5
99336,Good fit,99336,5
99337,"I bought it for my Child , and she said it is comfortble , and fit in her feet .",99337,5
99337,I like it!,99337,5
99338,"The med is about 29"" long (Lg 30.75), just over 17"" wide at the bottom band which stretches (Lg 19).",99338,5
99338,"My bust is almost 41"", my hips 36"".",99338,5
99338,The batwing sleeves give extra room for large busts & allows me to go down a size.,99338,5
99338,The medium fits me perfect & is so slimming.,99338,5
99338,This is one of the few tops on the market which is made for top heavy women like me (natural DD).,99338,5
99338,I just got to watch my belly fat in this.,99338,5
99338,"This is dressier than sweatshirts, not too thick or bulky, longer & still very comfortable.",99338,5
99338,"The fabric is good quality, not thin or see-through in any way unlike other brand's cheap tops here on amazon (like Leggings Queen or Clothes Effect).",99338,5
99338,The navy blue does look good with jeggings or jeans.,99338,5
99338,Update: I bought the pink in a large (not available in med for Prime) & added the stats.,99338,5
99338,"It is still slimming, but looser-fitting with extra room, great if you have a bit of a belly or like shirts slightly oversized.",99338,5
99338,I now know why some say it looks like a sweatshirt.,99338,5
99338,"The pink is not a solid color like the navy, but is ""heather"", making it look more casual & weathered- still looks better than a sweatshirt or plain t-shirt.",99338,5
99338,"The neckline is way too wide, but I knew that from the picture.",99338,5
99338,"My lazy quick fix for many of my tops is to fold the fabric over on itself at the back of the neck & pin it with 2 safety pins, making the opening smaller so my bra straps do not show.",99338,5
99338,My long hair covers that area.,99338,5
99338,"But the opening on this one is so big, I just might have to take it in on each side.",99338,5
99338,"I hate sewing but good quality, slimming tops made for people with smaller hips are hard to find.",99338,5
99338,I do wish they made these in more colors (not heather) & that the neckline was smaller.,99338,5
99338,"Sorry, I guess I am old school & do not believe that showing bra straps are sexy, only tacky & low class.",99338,5
99338,My only other complaint is that not all colors & sizes are available with 2 day prime shipping.,99338,5
99338,I have never been unsatisfied with the quality of Allegra K's tops.,99338,5
99338,They all seem very well-made with good quality fabric.,99338,5
99338,Never see-through or falling apart.,99338,5
99338,Allegra K: thanks for the batwing tops!,99338,5
99338,"Please make more styles & colors, especially for this summer!",99338,5

99383,Very versatile.,99383,5
99383,Probably the most fabulous pair in my collection.,99383,5
99383,"They are very light, just like others have said.",99383,5
99383,Also go up a half size just like others have said.,99383,5
99383,My only advice is to add some insoles for extra cushion on the forefoot.,99383,5
99383,They're platforms.,99383,5
99383,They're tall.,99383,5
99383,You will need it especially if you aren't used to wearing heels all day.,99383,5
99383,Also consider wearing them around the house for a bit to break them in.,99383,5
99383,"If you have any sort of misalignment in the way you walk, these will force you into a normal heel to toe gate and trust me you will want the break in period.",99383,5
99384,I love these socks!,99384,5
99384,"They fit great, are very soft, thick and cushy, they feel great while running and the tab on the heel prevents blisters.",99384,5
99384,I want to replace all of my running socks with these!,99384,5
99385,I have a pair of oakleys (unpolarized) and these have taken their place.,99385,5
99385,You're seriously better off buying $10 polarized glasses than $90 unpolarized that might be from a name brand,99385,5
99386,Love them,99386,5
99387,I would totally recommend these!,99387,5
99388,Super cute and comfy per my 6 year old.,99388,5
99389,Did not like to small,99389,5
99390,It looks great and is made well for a fun pillow cover,99390,5

99392,"Very nice looking, will buy more.",99392,5
99392,As pictured,99392,5
99393,Really cute bows,99393,5
99394,Many reviews commented that this top was too small.,99394,5
99394,I am a 32B and the small fit perfectly but I can see if you were busier than that then it would be an issue.,99394,5
99394,It's very feminine and comfortable and works with many different kinds of pants.,99394,5
99394,I love it!,99394,5
99395,Beautiful!,99395,5
99395,The picture does not depict how pretty it is!,99395,5
99396,soft and warm.,99396,5
99396,works just as the picture illustrates,99396,5
99397,It's a bit blousey but I ordered it for the length more than for the fit.,99397,5
99398,These are wonderful!,99398,5
99398,I liked them so much I ordered a second pair!,99398,5
99398,They help give support without being too tight.,99398,5
99398,"In fact they could be tighter through the mid section, I'm 5'7 and gave birth to twins.",99398,5
99398,I was 202 pounds the day I gave birth and 3 weeks later at 170 pounds they still fit great!,99398,5
99398,They help keep the excess skin from sagging and when I wear them with a binder or girdle people can't believe I had twins less than a month ago!!,99398,5
99398,I also ordered the up spring girdle but was not as happy with it as I have been these panties.,99398,5
99399,Very happy with the costume!,99399,5
99400,Got it from Six Times Seven.,99400,5
99400,"Fits great, good quality, and awesome small fit.",99400,5

99401,And she loved it very much.,99401,5
99402,Great product and price!,99402,5
99403,I have screw backs on my studs and to swap them out for regular backs would be too expensive.,99403,5
99403,Fortunately I found these and have been using them for a while and they work great and I didn't even have to swap out the post!,99403,5
99404,Very pretty & lightweight.,99404,5
99404,Well made & good value,99404,5
99405,I was really impressed with this ring; the sizing is true and I have received numerous compliments.,99405,5
99405,I highly recommend it as it is a beautiful anniversary band to either pair with your engagement ring or on alone on your ring finger.,99405,5
99405,Love it!,99405,5
99406,Fits very well,99406,5
99407,"Bought these charm necklaces for my granddaughters, they absolutely loved it.",99407,5
99407,The jewelry looks of nice quality.,99407,5
99408,"Nice jacket, great value!",99408,5
99409,I bought this as a gift.,99409,5

99409,Works great.,99409,5
99409,Convenient.,99409,5
99409,Love the size.,99409,5
99409,Love the portableness.,99409,5
99410,love it but somewhat small in length.,99410,5
99410,preferred it to be longer ..like a tee shirt for a man perhaps.,99410,5
99410,women tee shirt are always shorter than the men.,99410,5
99410,"we like our tee shirt long too, to cover our butt sometimes.",99410,5
99411,Thicker than I had thought and super cute.,99411,5
99412,This watch is awesome.,99412,5
99412,It is well made and looks amazing.,99412,5
99412,I purchased this watch for my husband as a gift and he loves it.,99412,5
99412,He is a tall/big guy and even had to take a link out and the face is plenty big for his wrist.,99412,5
99412,Great purchase,99412,5
99413,I sized up in this dress to a 12.,99413,5
99413,I normally wear a 10 and I am going to buy another one in that size.,99413,5
99413,The 12 is a bit too big .,99413,5
99413,The polka dots are much bigger than the picture shows but it's still a cute lightweight dress.,99413,5
99413,"It is see thru, so I wear a half slip with it and it's fine.",99413,5
99413,"If you are going to buy this, get your normal size.",99413,5
99413,It really is one of the most comfortable dresses I have ever worn.,99413,5
99413,Love the pockets.,99413,5
99413,They do not make my hips look any bigger nor are they awkward in any sense.,99413,5
99413,The material is like a cotton/poly blend.,99413,5
99413,It's not hot at all to wear here in Florida.,99413,5
99413,The straps are adjustable also.,99413,5
99413,I would highly recommend this dress to any one.,99413,5
99414,This product does what it says.,99414,5
99414,It fits great and flattens out the tummy area.,99414,5
99414,I needed something to apply enough pressure to help get rid of bloat and water from my midsection when it's that time of the month.,99414,5
99414,I'm usually a medium so I had to order a 2XL so make sure you look at the sizing chart located in the picture section.,99414,5
99414,As of now I can only loop the hooks on the first row ( there are 3 rows) and its tight.,99414,5
99414,Overall great product for the price you pay.,99414,5
99415,"Did not shrink much when washed, good quality infant socks.",99415,5
99416,I knew from previous purchases to size up with Alternative.,99416,5
99416,Great shorts otherwise!,99416,5
99417,Very comfortable.,99417,5
99417,Love them!,99417,5

99420,It was custom-made to fit me.,99420,5
99420,My sash was made royal blue to fit my wedding colors.,99420,5
99421,I love them :D,99421,5
99422,This is 47x47 and is excellent cotton material.,99422,5
99422,"Not to thick,  not to thin.",99422,5
99422,Exactly as picture.,99422,5
99423,Fit my fingers well!,99423,5
99423,I've had these for months and no tarnishing.,99423,5
99424,what a pleasure.,99424,5
99424,"took it out of the carton, gave it a spritz of water spray, hung up in the shower and all the packing creases came out.",99424,5
99424,wore it the same night.,99424,5

99425,It was very beautiful!,99425,5

99425,"It is a detailed piece of jewelery, unique and eye catching.",99425,5
99425,"It is larger than pic shows as well, but not tacky big.",99425,5
99425,Just right.,99425,5
99425,I would purchase again for anyone who loves cats and unique jewelery.,99425,5
99426,Like the stability of the insole in the arch.,99426,5
99426,Seems like a great product for the price right out of the gates.,99426,5
99427,Love these glasses!,99427,5
99427,Great Price,99427,5
99428,I have had plantar fasciitis for several years and have tried many footwear inserts.,99428,5
99428,"These inserts are the most comfortable I have found, the arch support sitting as desired.",99428,5
99428,With other products the arch support typically sits too close to the heel of the foot and is extremely uncomfortable.,99428,5
99428,I highly recommend giving these a try,99428,5
99429,Great Hat!,99429,5
99430,I'm glad I payed attention to the sizing chart.,99430,5
99430,"This is a nice swimsuit if you are like me, looking to be modest.",99430,5
99430,This suit is lovely without being heavy and frumpy.,99430,5
99430,"Great color, but my only complaint was a heavy chemical smell that took a couple of washes to get rid of.",99430,5
99431,Perfect cover up when you can't wear a bra.,99431,5
99432,Irea,99432,5
99433,The shape itself is wonderful.,99433,5
99433,"Mine arrived black, not yellowish, but no biggie, even cooler.",99433,5
99433,"If you're buying this, keep in mind it won't only need painting work, but also some cutting here and there to make your arm fit better.",99433,5
99433,Maybe put some foam inside to keep the pieces in place.,99433,5
99433,All depends on your size and the needs for your arm.,99433,5
99433,Overall the pice has an amazing shape just like Bucky's arm.,99433,5
99433,Let's get to it!,99433,5
99434,These are by far the best footie pajamas out there.,99434,5
99434,"They fit well, but not so tight that's it's uncomfortable.",99434,5

100045,My measurements are 38-29-38 so I bought an XXL to ensure the bust and arms fit well.,100045,5

100051,"I bought an Extra Large, and I usually buy that size in jackets.",100051,5

100051,"Unless I'm out in the middle of nowhere and would never be seen by another living creature, I would not wear the liner by itself.",100051,5
100051,"However, with it in this M-65 Reproduction Jacket, it keeps me warm and toasty.",100051,5
100051,"I was outside the other day, and if I remember correctly the air temperature was around 22 degrees Fahrenheit, with a goodly wind ranging from five to maybe fifteen miles per hour, and I did not feel it at all with the Jacket and Liner.",100051,5
100051,"If it rains, the jacket is going to get wet.",100051,5
100051,"The green color is a fair shade darker than an Original Issue M-65 in Olive Drab, and the breast pockets are smaller, not by a huge margin, but some, than Original Issue.",100051,5
100051,"Both points I just mentioned can be heavily debated, as the M-65's depending on when they were manufactured and by what contractor, would vary by a huge amount in some cases.",100051,5
100051,This Jacket by Alpha Industries is quite well made.,100051,5
100051,"The brass zipper, metal buttons on the pockets, and Velcro on the neck and sleeves are all top-notch.",100051,5

100052,I get so many compliments on this hat when my baby wears it!,100052,5
100052,It's adorable!,100052,5

100665,"It has a unique style with the contrast details, the shoulder pleating, and the style of the snaps (which I initially thought were buttons based on the picture).",100665,5
100665,"The same snap design used on the shirt front is also used on the sleeves/cuffs, and they are made of metal- so they should be durable.",100665,5
100665,The material seems sturdy rather than cheap.,100665,5
100665,Be aware of Asian sizing and order a size or two up from what you normally would wear in a US size.,100665,5
100666,Perfect maternity dress.,100666,5
100666,You can dress it up or keep it casual,100666,5
100667,"Great earrings but for your cartilage they are a bit too big, I love the colors I ordered all of them.",100667,5

100668,She loved it.,100668,5
100668,We sent her measurements to the seller when we placed the order and it fit exactly.,100668,5
100668,We paid for expedited shipping and got the dress in about a week.,100668,5
100668,"We did need to have it shortened, but this was due to the style of the dress and not an error in measuring.",100668,5
100668,My daughter wanted to dance without holding it up so we had three inches taken from the length; it does have a slight train to the style which we removed as well.,100668,5
100668,She received many compliments and it was very pretty.,100668,5
100668,With shipping it was about $95 which is a bargain compared to the $200-300 other girls paid for their gowns bought locally.,100668,5
100668,Anyone looking for a special occasion dress this is a good buy.,100668,5
100668,"There are a lot of choices online, just do your research and pay close attention to reviews before purchasing.",100668,5

100682,I love this clutch - it goes with me everywhere and fits my bare essentials.,100682,5
100682,"I wish the strap disconnected and it seems like the leather will wear quickly, so use it sparingly (mostly for special occasions) but it's too cute to pass up.",100682,5
100683,My daughter loved it.,100683,5
100683,It's a small backpack but it's pretty cute and durable.,100683,5
100684,"I absolutely love these earrings, especially the level of detail in the bat sculpture.",100684,5
100684,The face looks like either a vampire or Mexican bat due to the shape of the ears and snout.,100684,5

100772,I ordered this top to use under my corsets.,100772,5
100772,"It's a thinner material, which is great because wearing corsets during any time of the year tends to get a little warm and during the summer (when we go to the most conventions) it's even worse, so I needed something with a thinner material to wear under my corsets so I don't overheat.",100772,5
100772,The frilly collar piece is great for steampunk and lolita outfits and I love the little pearl accents around the collar.,100772,5
100772,"I leave it unbuttoned a little bit, but it looks just as cute fully buttoned.",100772,5
100772,"It is a little short for my liking (hits me at just above hips), but I am wearing it under corsets and not by itself so it's not that big of a deal.",100772,5
100772,The armpit area of the shirt it kind of odd.,100772,5
100772,"It's really large and shows more than desired, but once again, it actually ends up benefiting me in the manner I wear it (lets airflow so I'm cooler while being surrounded by a ton of people in a small space).",100772,5
100773,I was very satisfied with the shirt.,100773,5
100773,It was made well with very good material.,100773,5
100773,I would recommend this product,100773,5
100774,Great quality and flattering look.,100774,5
100774,Way too small and size chart way off.,100774,5

100775,Good ring.,100775,5
100775,Keeps the shine and very durable,100775,5
100776,Well made and the tigers eye stones are beautiful.,100776,5
100776,The elastic band that hold the beads together is solid and looks like it will hold up for quite a while.,100776,5
100776,Also like the distinct sound that the beads make when you move your hand quickly.,100776,5
100776,Very subtle but a cool reminder to check them out.,100776,5
100776,Great product and would buy again from them.,100776,5
100776,And the box they came in was a nice touch.,100776,5

100778,"The chain doesn't look very expensive, but I put a different one on it and it looks great.",100778,5
100779,"Somewhat small, but SO COMFORTABLE!!",100779,5
100779,Definitely going ahead and buying another.,100779,5

101667,"There are a few points that I should mention, concerns that I had when I ordered this about a year and a half ago.",101667,5
101667,1.,101667,5
101667,This wallet is larger than my old wallet and I was afraid that it would fit too tightly in my back right pocket.,101667,5
101667,"Turn out, it fits PERFECTLY in jeans, khakis, etc.",101667,5
101667,2.,101667,5
101667,C'mon.,101667,5
101667,I have to carry LOTS of cards and cash and the like.,101667,5
101667,No way will this be as thin as they say.,101667,5
101667,FALSE.,101667,5
101667,It IS as thin as they say.,101667,5
101667,It is a good thing.,101667,5
101667,3.,101667,5
101667,The cards fit such that the openings face the fold.,101667,5
101667,I absolutely LOVE this design feature as it completely and securely holds the cards with no fear of them falling out.,101667,5
101667,4.,101667,5
101667,The inside is a rip-stop nylon with a leather exterior.,101667,5
101667,"The nylon is FANTASTIC for, when traveling and the ticket agent gives you the bag claim sticker.",101667,5
101667,"Stays securely, comes off without leaving glue or stickiness.",101667,5
101667,Always a plus.,101667,5
101667,One word of warning with this wallet however.,101667,5
101667,Something that I never would have though of before I started using it.,101667,5
101667,"Since this wallet is so thin, it is not as obvious that you have your wallet with you.",101667,5
101667,"Even when you sit down, if you're use to a really thick wallet in your back pocket, it won't feel like anything is there.",101667,5
101667,"This is a REALLY good thing, but something that it took me a few weeks to get use to.",101667,5

101667,I've carried it for a year and a half and it's held up EXTREMELY well.,101667,5
101667,"When (or if) this should wear out, I would not hesitate to buy another one.",101667,5
101668,My new SKX009K1 arrived today and so did the Barton Navy/Crimson band.,101668,5
101668,It is a great length compared with some other NATO style bands in that for me it does not need to be wrapped back towards the clasp.,101668,5
101668,The material is good quality as well for the price.,101668,5
101668,In my opinion the watch looks better for it.,101668,5
101668,Will definitely order more.,101668,5
101669,"The patterns on these were so adorable, I couldn't pass them up.",101669,5

102966,"At first I thought it was a little too big, but I absolutely love it!",102966,5
102967,It was a little confusing when reading about the description of these sunglasses.,102967,5
102967,"Description says ""made in USA"" and if you know a thing or two about Ray-Ban, they're Italian made...then I contacted a representative and they told me they come from Seattle (maybe that's what they meant by ""made in USA""?",102967,5
102967,"), but they could be shipped from China and the probability of them being fake was high or if they're shipped from Seattle, Washington, they'd be the real deal.",102967,5
102967,I don't understand how a company can have their product shipped from two locations - some product genuine and some product not.,102967,5
102967,The reviews on Amazon are totally mixed and random.,102967,5
102967,Many people got fake sunglasses and many people got real ones.,102967,5
102967,"I decided to take the risk and worst case scenario, I'd get my money back in the event they were not real Ray-Bans.",102967,5
102967,Mine just arrived today!,102967,5
102967,So my review is very much fresh and new.,102967,5
102967,"I own 2 pairs of Ray-Bans (sunglasses and eyeglasses) so I knew to check:
1.",102967,5
102967,"The box for the ""made Italy"" (Milano/Milan)
2.",102967,5
102967,"Check the top left lenses for the engraving of the RB logo
3.",102967,5
102967,"Make sure the shades don't come in a plastic bag but rather the frames (the part that goes behind the ear) are protected by a plastic cover
4.",102967,5
102967,"The case has to be authentic and have the Ray-Ban stamp

Mine had all of these details and I am pleased with my purchase of well-priced, lightweight, authentic, Italian made, summer ready, Ray-Bans.",102967,5
102967,"With every purchase on Amazon its better to double check with the seller where in fact the item is coming from, ask about the authenticity, and other concerns that may arise.",102967,5
102967,I hope this review was helpful and substantial!,102967,5
102968,Just what I wanted.,102968,5

102976,They stay put without pinching.,102976,5
102977,I ordered a small and it fits just like a small.,102977,5
102977,"Snug and comfortable, the pockets are pretty shallow roughly the depth of a stick of chapstick one of the bottom seams in one of my pockets has come undone but nothing that alittle liquid stich cannot fix.",102977,5
102977,Other than that it is well made and the zippers are heavy duty.,102977,5
102977,Did I mention how warm it is?!,102977,5
102977,Oh yes!,102977,5
102977,I went for a run in 20 degree weather with a thermal and a t shirt over it with this vest on and by the time I was done with 5k both my shirts were soaked.,102977,5

102979,This necklace was a good deal for the price.,102979,5
102979,All the stones are present and set in firmly.,102979,5
102979,I like the bling and the natural colours which match a  lot of outfits.,102979,5
102980,Great quality.,102980,5
102980,"We left one that we bought in Germany, in Germany and this one is better quality.",102980,5

103168,!,103168,5
103169,Very much liked the length of this jacket as well as the weight of it...Pockets were good size but coat is cut quite generously so may overwhelm smaller frames..I like things baggy and am tall 5'8'' so it looked okay on me... overall  I found the fit of the LG a ''little too much on the LG size'' even though I usually take XLG in tops.,103169,5
103169,Size 14 -16 -18.....IMPORTANT.,103169,5
103169,.....Make sure to read size chart first or contact seller if unsure of what size to order.,103169,5
103169,"..........Shoulders measured 20'' on the LG jacket  , 17 on the Size MEDIUM, so with my shoulders measuring 18'' wide I had to settle for the LG size one though it fit wider thru the body then I liked...Loved the color so much (Bark) though  it wasn't a deal breaker....
Great neutral color, that will work well in the spring or fall months even into the winter months I expect if some heavy layering is done underneath.",103169,5
103169,Also appears very well made though sizing is a little off to the American comparative sizing used...Sellers were good enough to send  measurements after the fact (My fault for not contacting before sale) to explain the shoulder widths between the one I ordered and the size down so it saved me doing a unnecessary exchange only to get another size in that would not have fit any better..Happy enough even if it is a bit too lg.,103169,5
103169,.I'll make it work..Would purchase from them again.,103169,5
103170,Love these glasses.,103170,5

103174,This is a well made dress.,103174,5
103174,Runs small so order a size larger.,103174,5

103702,It is very nice and structured at the bottom.,103702,5
103702,It definitely doesn't look cheap like most Halloween costumes.,103702,5

103712,Colors are vibrant on the dress and what I could feel felt good on me.,103712,5
103712,Was very tight up under the breasts and in turn it made it difficult to zip up in the back.,103712,5
103712,:(,103712,5
103713,These are not shoes so the question of fit and wear are not relevant.,103713,5
103713,However it's a high quality boot stretcher.,103713,5
103713,It widens any boot in a day and is very well made.,103713,5
103713,I learned by buying a cheap version made of plastic which broke in a month.,103713,5
103713,This is more expensive but it saves a fortune if your shoes are tight.,103713,5
103714,My son loved it!,103714,5
103715,these are now in my new winter boots UNDER the fur inserts.,103715,5

103730,Amazing watch band.,103730,5
103730,Absolutely love it with my Pebble Time Steel.,103730,5

103734,"Important features to know before you buy:
-They are reflective!",103734,5
103734,"The pictures seem inconsistent, but that was the important feature for me.",103734,5
103734,"-I have a large head and these fit perfectly, so they might be oversized for an average or petite head.",103734,5
103734,"-Your view isn't tinted pink, it's a normal greyish black layer, so despite the cute, light finish, it does a great job functionally as well.",103734,5
103735,My son's new fav shoes.,103735,5
103735,He absolutely loves them and wants to wear them all the time.,103735,5

103737,Super cute.,103737,5
103738,My husband loves it..,103738,5
103738,Even tho the size I ordered(XL) was way too small since its Chinese size but I got an exchange for a bigger size the next day...perfect.,103738,5
103739,NOTE: this jacket is probably meant for cosplay uses only.,103739,5
103739,It is not going to keep you warm.,103739,5
103739,"I ordered the survey blue jacket that goes to the waist, and it is a pretty good jacket.",103739,5
103739,The symbols were sewn on and there is a lining on this inside that makes it a bit more comfortable.,103739,5
103739,"It fits me tight around the shoulders, but I can't penalize the company for that because I have rather broad shoulders, so it's not their fault.",103739,5
103739,The only downside i can find for this jacket is the fact that it can not keep you warm whatsoever.,103739,5
103739,It is only meant for cosplay.,103739,5
103740,If you like paneled ivy caps this one is for you.,103740,5

104000,It fits my Seiko 5 perfectly.,104000,5
104000,"Being a NATO, it is much easier to install than a leather strap, as the fabric allows for more play with the material than leather.",104000,5
104000,"The picture is extremely accurate in terms of coloring and the polished finish on the buckle, and metal components.",104000,5
104000,"Additionally, the strap comes very well packaged in a sturdy Clockwork Synergy branded box, so rest assured it will arrive in very good condition

As a reminder with this strap and the majority of others on the market, it does NOT include spring bars.",104000,5
104000,"To install it, simply exchange spring bars with your existing strap.",104000,5

104001,Fits as expected and like the fit overall.,104001,5
104002,"Longer than most, but it's a fun outfit.",104002,5

104003,The sides have a knit fabric that allows it to stretch.,104003,5
104003,The vest kept my core warm in 40 degree weather and kept out the wind and the detachable hoodie came out easily but could be used for a light rain or to give your neck some extra warmth.,104003,5
104003,It seems to be decently made.,104003,5
104003,"All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase.",104003,5

104024,She loves them.,104024,5

104093,I have a pair in black that I have had for a few years and they are sooo comfortable and soft.,104093,5
104093,"These are a bit harder but I think after having worn them a few times, they will get softer.",104093,5

104104,I wear a Small.,104104,5
104104,The sleeves at the shoulders just fit.,104104,5
104104,This blouse has no openings to put it on.,104104,5
104104,I can put it on and take it off fairly easily but I'm pretty flexible.,104104,5
104104,I can see how it may be a problem for some to get both arms and your head in without a crowbar or someone's help.,104104,5
104104,"Once it's on, the blouse (not dress, too short) is roomy and flowy (spell check claims that's not a word).",104104,5
104104,I think it'll be cute with skinny jeans.,104104,5

104114,It doesnt bounce around my wrist so the front of the bracelet is never moved over to the side.,104114,5
104114,That drives me crazy when you can't see the bracelet design because it doesnt stay in place.,104114,5
104114,This is exactly what I hoped it would be and so much more.,104114,5

104133,I love this swim suit because it solves all my insecurities!,104133,5
104133,"After having a child - for the ones that aren't lucky enough to lose the baby fat as easily - it's only comforting to enjoy wearing a swim suit that hides the insecurities, but still is flattering.",104133,5
104133,I like that the frills are long enough to cover your stomach even if you were to switch up the bottoms.,104133,5
104133,"The hubs said the bottoms looked like granny panties, so I switched them out for regular swim suit bottoms and I still have the ability to, somewhat cover my stomach area.",104133,5
104133,"All in all, so worth the price.",104133,5

104157,My fiance bought this for our anniversary as my present and I love it!,104157,5

104161,But overall they are great!,104161,5
104161,!,104161,5
104162,Very nice.,104162,5
104162,"the faux leather is thin, but doesn't have that cheap feeling; of course it's not a high end product, but for the price is great.",104162,5
104162,"I got KHAKI, the actual color leans between gray and brownish, depending on the light.",104162,5
104162,"I chose size L - I'm size M US, 5.7"" tall and ca 130lbs - fits great.",104162,5
104162,"Overall, good purchase, but you have to pay attention to measurements provided.",104162,5
104163,"Justin's GF here, Valentina

I put this as ""Somewhat Large"" because the bottoms are ridiculously LARGE.",104163,5
104163,"Fortunately for me, this whole outfit is perfect.",104163,5
104163,"Please don't take this the wrong way, but if you're not a curvy person this may not be right for you.",104163,5
104163,"Hear me out:
I'm a short gal, C-Cup, 27 inch waist, 40 inch rear, very wide hips and bottom heavy.",104163,5
104163,I bought a size SMALL and the bottoms feel like a size 5 or 6 in regular clothing (which fits my bum perfectly).,104163,5
104163,"The bottoms are so cute, they make my butt look even more cheeky than they already are.",104163,5
104163,"However, the top looks a bit odd.",104163,5
104163,It's not as it looks in the picture.,104163,5
104163,"For some reason the straps aren't pulling straight upwards, it's pulling to the corners of my shoulders?",104163,5
104163,Not sure if this was sewn on wrong by accident or if anyone else is having the same funny issue.,104163,5
104163,"However because it does this, the corner from where the straps meet the rest of top, that corner is flipped outwards thus showing a sliver of the inside of the bra.",104163,5
104163,"It looks really weird, I either have to get this fixed or just keep fixing the straps anytime it slips outwards.",104163,5
104163,That or my breasts aren't large enough haha.,104163,5
104163,"btw, This is not a push up for anyone who is looking for one.",104163,5
104163,I can't complain because I didn't know this was supposed to be a push up to begin with.,104163,5
104163,"It's enough padding to hide your headlights, which is great for me.",104163,5
104164,These are amazing.,104164,5
104164,They look and feel like a million bucks.,104164,5
104165,Beautiful charm.,104165,5
104165,Great quality.,104165,5
104165,This ocean mosaic pave charm sparkles beautiful on my Pandora bracelet.,104165,5
104166,Super cute!,104166,5
104167,"I'm a relatively thin person and dresses don't exactly accentuate my curves, but this dress was perfect for me.",104167,5
104167,"I wore it on Valentine's Day and my man thought it looked amazing on me, so no complaints here!",104167,5
104168,Very nice and colorful collection of socks.,104168,5
104169,"This dress worked beautifully for what I needed it, maternity pics.",104169,5
104169,I layered it with a cardigan and a belt.,104169,5
104169,I ordered a 2x when I usually wear a l/xl.,104169,5
104169,The dress is flowy and has a bit of stretch to it.,104169,5
104169,"If I was wearing it for longer than pictures, I would have the dress altered and taken up a bit at the bottom hem, I am 5,5"" and it was dragging the ground.",104169,5
104169,Very beautiful slightly off white color.,104169,5
104170,This was my first vintage print dress.,104170,5
104170,I was skeptical however I truly liked this one.,104170,5
104170,"real nice printed material, not too thin or short.",104170,5
104170,It fit as I was hoping it would and went fantastic with the sandals I ordered to wear with it.,104170,5
104170,would buy this for gifts.,104170,5
104171,True to bra size and comfortable and secure to wear.,104171,5
104171,High five!,104171,5
104172,I bought one of these and one of the bellaband basic.,104172,5
104172,The main difference is that this one has the non-slip silicone on one end.,104172,5
104172,I used both of my bands and they both fit great.,104172,5
104172,Definitely helped with the transition between not being able to zip my pants and not being ready for maternity clothes yet.,104172,5
104172,"I think I liked this one more, because of the non-slip grip but it's a trade-off with the increase in price.",104172,5
104173,Perfect fit,104173,5
104174,Super cute and keeps my little one warm,104174,5
104175,Love them!,104175,5
104175,!,104175,5
104176,Very nice pair f sunglasses.,104176,5
104176,I have a small face so well fitting glasses are hard to find.,104176,5
104176,There are SO many choices in this line.,104176,5
104176,I will probably come back for another color soon.,104176,5
104177,I sent this to my sister for her birthday!,104177,5
104177,"She loves it, says it fits perfect~~~~~",104177,5
104178,It seems to be pretty high quality material.,104178,5
104178,Doesn't look like the material will scratch my glasses.,104178,5
104179,Port Authority long sleeve twill shirt fit perfect.,104179,5
104179,Has some heft to the twill fabric and is made well.,104179,5
104180,So comfortable!,104180,5
104181,Good product great price.,104181,5
104182,The bottoms fit like panties as I had read in some of the other reviews and the top area fit kind of large but only cuz I have an almost C cup.,104182,5
104182,I believe the size recommended to fit was to order 2 sizes larger and I did expect the cups to fit larger than I am.,104182,5
104182,The suit was cute and the colors were great.,104182,5
104182,"Overall, I was happy with it.",104182,5
104183,I love this shirt it compliments me in the right places although the material does tend to bunch up due to the zipper but other than that it's perfect.,104183,5
104184,Good Price for a pack of yogi socks!,104184,5
104185,"very cute, very sturdy, my toddler granddaughter loves it",104185,5
104186,Super cute,104186,5
104187,Great product just like the picture no scam,104187,5
104188,I read the reviews and noticed that people said to order a size up so that's what I did and it fit just fine.,104188,5
104189,"Out of all the pajamas I purchased for my 2-year-old toddler son, this one is the best.",104189,5
104189,I unfortunately had to get a size 4t bc of the trend of super tight fitting pajamas.,104189,5
104189,I have read so many similar complaints about that and I don't know what kind of fire hazard they expect a child in modernity to get exposed to.,104189,5
104189,There is probably some sort of weird regulation that I am ignorant of.,104189,5
104189,"My son is tall and somewhat skinny (95% in height and 50% in weight), but still I have to buy a larger size so his legs can fit in width.",104189,5
104189,The zipper has cover on top and this is very important for comfort I have found.,104189,5
104189,The material stands up to wash and is the right thickness in my opinion.,104189,5
104190,I love the way this bikini fits as well as the color!,104190,5
104190,I've been searching for a plus size bikini for awhile and am extremely grateful to have stumbled across this one.,104190,5
104190,I wear size 18-20 pants and 40D bras.,104190,5
104190,I was skeptical to buy this at first because I wasn't sure it would fit.,104190,5
104190,I ordered the 3X just to be in the safe side and it fit perfectly.,104190,5
104190,I love the push up bra top.,104190,5

105017,The top is a little see through and the skirt has one piece of velcro to attach it together.,105017,5
105017,But I actually kind of like that about it.,105017,5
105017,Plus it was shipped discretely (it was packaged in a clear bag that was inside a larger white bag that was inside an even larger white bag that was shipped inside a clear very large bag.),105017,5

105020,"The fabric is also of a poorer quality and doesn't stretch like the AA dress, but it's still thick enough to be worn without a bra.",105020,5
105020,The tags on it say Amanzoo Apparel (lol) and it's packaged to look like an AA product.,105020,5
105020,I'd recommend sizing up in this if the AA dress is tight on you as it's not stretchy at all.,105020,5

105027,"Its shell is windproof, the flaps keep my ears and throat warm, and the face shield gives me full nose and cheek coverage without making me feel like I'm suffocating, the way so many of my other concoctions for trying to keep warm do.",105027,5
105027,"I was worried that it might fit too loosely because the ad states that it's best for 22""-24"" heads, and I measure 21.75"", but it couldn't fit any more perfectly, with or without the fleece headband that I sometimes wear beneath it to give my ears and forehead an extra layer.",105027,5

106184,"One is green, the other is blue.",106184,5
106184,These balls (all except for the glow in the dark ones) allow you to add drops of your favorite essential oils or perfumes onto them and insert them into the necklace.,106184,5

106196,It is adjustable with Velcro in the back.,106196,5
106197,Let me start the review by stating that I returned this dress in two sizes - 16 and 18W - both were too small.,106197,5
106197,The craftsmanship of the dress was very good!,106197,5
106197,"Fully lined with a built-in bra makes the dress a little stiff in the bodice, but it would be easy to sacrifice a little comfort to not have to wear a bra.",106197,5
106197,The sizing runs a little smaller than posted on the site since these are made in China (I didn't realize that when I ordered).,106197,5
106197,Make SURE you communicate with the Seller at the time of your order.,106197,5
106197,They will custom make a dress for you if you send them your measurements on their form.,106197,5
106197,Unfortunately I did not realize this when I ordered and so I ordered two different sizes (16 & 18W).,106197,5
106197,"The ""stock"" sizes arrived and they were WAY too small.",106197,5
106197,"After communicating with the Seller, I opted to return the dresses at my cost ($50!!).",106197,5
106197,"They did suggest to have someone in the US alter the dresses,  however because they were too small, it was not worth the additional cost.",106197,5
106197,Bottom line?,106197,5
106197,Seller worked well with me regarding the return/credit and the quality of the dress was very good.,106197,5
106197,Lesson Learned?,106197,5
106197,"Check the country of Origin (where it's coming from), return policy and ask the Seller if they take your measurements.",106197,5
106198,"Bought it for my mom, she loved it.",106198,5
106198,"Held up really well,  didn't stain or anything, awesome buy",106198,5

106206,these are awesome i love them so much they are a LITTLE hard to screw on but good overall.,106206,5
106206,i ordered two sets because i read other reviews and it said that there wasn't matches.,106206,5
106206,so i got two orders.,106206,5
106206,so now i have two sets of each.,106206,5
106206,just DONT ORDER TWO SETS!,106206,5

106208,"Anyways, when I got them, I started wearing them immediately.",106208,5
106208,"I love them, and still have them, they are pretty good about being scratch resistant in my opinion can't tell you how many times I have dropped them and they didn't break or have any scratches.",106208,5

106215,I am thinking about buying another one as a gift for my sister.,106215,5
106215,I am very happy with my purchase.,106215,5
106215,I usually where a small but because I am using it for layering I wanted it to be a little bigger.,106215,5
106215,The large in China is more like a medium here in the US!,106215,5
106216,"Solid string, no silly plastic junk, perfect for wrist, very pretty and doesn't look cheap.",106216,5
106216,"Not really good for counting/meditation, it's more a piece of jewelry - very small beads.",106216,5
106216,Very pretty.,106216,5
106217,Love these for my little guy.,106217,5

106224,Love that it has the strap so my 13 month old can't pull it off.,106224,5
106225,Wow!,106225,5
106225,I have been looking for a monokini that did not break my wallet and this crochet monokini looks great!,106225,5
106225,I had to adjust the straps for the top part because the way it is designed made it so that your girls fall out of the side.,106225,5
106225,"The string is long enough to wrap around the back to the other side, wrap into another hole on the side and then around again to the other side so that you have a double strap.",106225,5
106225,"If you need pictures, I can take some :) I have another monokini from the very well known swimsuit and undergarment store and it looks just as good!",106225,5

106229,"Nowadays big purchases get paid using a credit card, and folks will carry a small amount of cash for other things or at festivals and such.",106229,5
106229,That's why a place for cash on the outer side is perfect!,106229,5
106229,"I'm so in love with this purse, and I only just got it yesterday!!!",106229,5
106229,"Firstly, the strap has a well-stitched fabric backing which means,.. No more falling off your shoulder!",106229,5
106229,"The purse is extremely well made with strong, smooth zippers and stitching.",106229,5
106229,"The inside fabric is slick like silk, and would be better if it had a cloth lining like cotton to help keep things snug inside.",106229,5
106229,"But with it's compact size, I don't feel things will have space to move around and so it won't be an issue.",106229,5
106229,I keep my iPhone 6s in the inside b/c I am not a slave to my cell phone.,106229,5
106229,What I love the most is the ability to use the side zipper easily for bills (like a man's wallet) & coins together.,106229,5
106229,"I know, I'm repeating myself, but it's so awesome, really!",106229,5
106229,Most purses the bills have to be folded to fit where your coins go or put in a seperate compartment which is just dumb.,106229,5
106229,I am so happy to have found this purse!,106229,5
106229,"Perfect for women who don't carry around a bunch of junk, and shallow enough where you don't have to dig down for small items.",106229,5

106312,The finish is beautiful.,106312,5
106312,I want to say there's a slight almost baby-blue cast to it that's really only apparent under fluorescent light -- but it's NOTHING like the greyer-tinged metals.,106312,5

106774,I use these to fasten pants or blouses when wearing a blazer or cardigan.,106774,5
106774,These are easy to use by attaching to the lower part of a blouse at the small of the back to help tailor the top.,106774,5
106774,I am bigger up top and have to buy larger shirts so these help to add fit to the waist area.,106774,5

106775,!,106775,5
106776,"This purse is really nice and well-made, lightweight, nice color, lots of compartments and pockets  I usually like a purse half this size but I needed something to carry my iPad plus  I think it would probably fit in the front flap pocket so I am going to look for one of your purses that are a size smaller  On the plus side I went out to lunch with my realtor today and she raved about my purse so I am take my things out in the car and gave it to her she was thrilled she also likes leopardprint just like I do  So if you're debating this will fit an iPad class which is 8 x 10"" perfectly and it is a very stylish purse",106776,5
106777,"I LOVE THIS

I've bought it to EDCLV, Tommorrowworld, Dancefestopia, and many other local shows.",106777,5
106777,"I am a hardcore dancer too, and this thing has kept up!",106777,5

106780,Best online find thus far.,106780,5
106780,Fits perfect !,106780,5
106780,There's an extra fold inside by the cleavage area to tuck your bra away and make it completely invisible !,106780,5
106780,!,106780,5
106780,This dress was definitely short but I still give it 5 stars !,106780,5
106780,I got so many compliments the first night I wore it out !,106780,5
106781,LOOKS GREAT!MAKES YOU LOOK REALLY SLIM,106781,5
106782,My package arrived promptly.,106782,5
106782,"I was not entirely sure about their sizing because on the listing the size is listed as ""STANDARD.""",106782,5
106782,"Turns out that the label on the package said that it's Size 14/16, which is perfect!",106782,5
106782,"But then again... even if it says Size 2, it would have been perfect because I purchased this for the hooded cape and NOT the dress.",106782,5
106782,As for the hooded cape...,106782,5
106782,"I am 5'4"", and even with 6 inch heels... this thing still drags on the ground, which is EXACTLY what I want.",106782,5
106782,I didn't want something that did not drag on the floor even in heels.,106782,5
106782,"As for the dress... since my regular clothing size fluctuates between 13/14 to 15/16, depending on the clothing manufacturer... the dress fits like a glove.",106782,5
106782,"The material is thin, and somewhat see-thru, but it's pretty standard for packaged costumes.",106782,5
106782,"The dress is pretty plain, it's just a straight tubular shape.",106782,5
106782,"If you're curvy like me, it will hug your curves.",106782,5
106782,"However the material is not super stretchy... it has a little bit of stretch, so if you normally wear clothing larger than 15/16... this may not work for you.",106782,5
106783,A lil tight on the upper part but hides stomach area perfect,106783,5
106784,Love it,106784,5
106785,This was more reasonably priced than the others and is beautiful.,106785,5
106785,It's adjustable to size.,106785,5
106785,"The tassel is permanently stitched so moving it from one side to the other will not be possible during the ceremony, however you can just spin the hat around for that particular moment.",106785,5
106785,Recommend highly.,106785,5
106786,This necklace is beautiful and appears much more expensive than the price-- Love it!,106786,5
106787,"I am very picky about my clothes, and this was a pleasant surprise.",106787,5
106787,"The material is unbelievably soft and stretchy, and it drapes nicely.",106787,5
106787,"I ordered two in XXL and loved them, even though they were a bit baggy---because comfort is far more important than style to me.",106787,5
106787,Yet they look far better and feel far more comfortable than the men's t-shirts that otherwise fill my closet.,106787,5
106787,"However, there was a dearth of available colors in the XXL  so I took a risk and ordered  a couple in XL.",106787,5
106787,The XL fits me a bit better---less baggy---while still maintaining a good drape and comfort.,106787,5
106787,"I like the v-neck too:  It's perfect in that it's not too deep, and for a large-busted gal like me it breaks up the space between my face and my chest very well without exposing a lot of skin.",106787,5
106787,"The length of the shirt is great too---not too short, not too long.",106787,5
106787,"I could probably stand even another inch or so on the sleeve length, but it's not too bad as is.",106787,5
106787,"They are not ""cap sleeves"", which I detest because I have always had big arms, even in my younger and skinnier years.",106787,5
106787,Overall I love these shirts.,106787,5
106787,"They have the comfort level of pajamas, but the appearance of ""out-in-public"" clothes.",106787,5
106787,I can even dress these up by pairing them with a skirt.,106787,5
106787,P.S.,106787,5
106787,I tried some similar tees from another brand (Texere) because they had more color selection but their fit was too snug for my taste (and I didn't like the round neck---that was when I realized shallow v-necks were the better look for me) and I sent them back.,106787,5
106788,This product is very pretty.,106788,5
106788,I like the blue.,106788,5
106788,It's a little smaller than the palm of my hand.,106788,5
106788,It looks cheap if you're close.,106788,5
106788,"The chain is cheap, it was accidentally broken within the first day, it was pulled on lightly and broken.",106788,5
106788,"But besides that,  it was very high quality and good for the price.",106788,5
106788,The sellers tried to get it to me quicker but I understand why it took so long.,106788,5
106788,They werevery polite and I will be buying from them again.,106788,5
106789,My niece loved her boots and didn't want to take them off.,106789,5

106793,Well made little boy boot and flashy too.,106793,5
106794,I recently purchased this dress for my Western Wedding.,106794,5

106794,To my amazement it fit PERFECTLY.,106794,5
106794,"I sent them my measurements and it fit like a glove, I don't like tight clothes so I added an inch to all my measurements.",106794,5

106794,The people I dealt with were amazing and very understanding.,106794,5

107454,This top would look great with jeans or a skirt.,107454,5
107454,The only minor issue I had was the top part was gaping slightly (and not barely even worth a mention).,107454,5

107455,It's nice and pretty.,107455,5

107467,"Anyway, it is super adorable and comfortable.",107467,5
107467,"The only ""problem"" I am having is with the bust area... it is a bit revealing but that's just my opinon, I am used to wearing more modest clothing but I figured it was going to fit that way because of the cut so I am going to pair it with other stuff and try to make it less revealing.",107467,5

107469,"As far as quality/comfort goes, it's very comfortable and seems to be of good quality.",107469,5
107469,The way it's designed might cause the stitching to be a bit of a nuisance after prolonged wearing.,107469,5

107650,As an older person with with elongated piercings these are the answer to the droopy earring look.,107650,5

107650,These are the only backs I now use with all my earrings.,107650,5
107650,Yes they are a little bit pricey when you see others that are cheaper.,107650,5

107662,I've been wearing this style of shirt for quite a while.,107662,5
107662,"Especially like the 2 pockets (IT nerd paradise :), and what's been described as ""thin"" material (great for TX summers).",107662,5
107662,VERY easy care: perm press/warm wash & perm press dry == no ironing (wrinkle free).,107662,5

107666,"I love the shoes, the part that goes into the pedal are not of shimano quality, the release is not as smooth and easy as shimano even after adjustments.",107666,5
107666,But for the price it is a good deal I think.,107666,5
107667,cute,107667,5
107668,I ordered this dress after buying another one from Allegra K.  I ordered a size Medium.,107668,5
107668,"I'm 5'5"" and typically wear a  medium or large.",107668,5
107668,This dress was a little more on the snug size but still looked cute.,107668,5
107668,"My boyfriend said ""wow"" when I walked in the room.",107668,5
107668,I think it's a bit on the short side to wear as just a dress.,107668,5
107668,I paired it with black leggings and black tall boots and it looked awesome.,107668,5
107668,The material was soft and stretchy.,107668,5

107669,Just in time for me to gorge myself on turkey and all the fixins and be able to easily let my belt out one ratchet at a time as my gut slowly expands to epic proportions only to end after I've eaten my last slice of pumpkin pie with gratuitous amounts of whipped cream on top.,107669,5
107669,"This belt is very comfortable with incremental adjustments, the quality of the belt itself looks great to me and there buckle is very nice.",107669,5

107670,At 23 weeks and still wearing my normal dress pants unhooked with the belly band to hold them up/closed.,107670,5
107670,From my research it's worth the money to buy the good ones as they wear and work much better.,107670,5
107670,"Glad I spent the moolah, as I'm getting tons of use.",107670,5

107799,There was no way that was going to fit on my body!,107799,5
107799,So after reading the mixed reviews on this one I was hesitant to buy it!,107799,5

The material is very lightweight and perfect for a hot environment, the skirt fit a little big around my waist but it depends on how high waisted or low waisted you want it, the higher it goes the looser it'll fit, since the material is so lightweight I was afraid it would be a little see through but my boyfriend said it wasn't at all

108221,But it's white so I knew that before buying.,108221,5
108221,"I am 5'2"" 145 lbs broad shoulders and my midsection has definitely seen some carbs but the dress hid the belly with a cut that lies right along the bottom of my ribcage.",108221,5
108221,Very versatile and flattering dress and I will buy more colors in the future.,108221,5
108222,Loveeeeeeeee,108222,5
108223,what a great surprise!,108223,5
108223,"these are the cutest most fun ear-bobs, I just love these",108223,5

108225,I ordered them on tuesday i think.... so quick yayyyy,108225,5
108226,Very cute little ring.,108226,5
108226,"Seems sturdy, doesn't turn my finger green.",108226,5
108226,"The ring is a bit small, but that's more my fault for ordering a size 7 when I'm a 7.5.",108226,5
108226,Fast delivery.,108226,5
108226,I recommend.,108226,5
108227,They are very useful and the fabric looks with a great durability,108227,5
108228,I love this ring!,108228,5
108228,It is so comfortable and perfectly sized.,108228,5
108228,And it's shine is just wow.,108228,5
108228,I'm not a jewelry person so I chose this because it's plain and understated but sometimes I just stare at it because it's so pretty when the light hits it.,108228,5
108228,It really does look white sometimes it's great.,108228,5
108229,Love this shirt for personal reasons.,108229,5
108230,Great workout pants for pregnancy.,108230,5
108230,"From running to lifting or aerobics, these are comfortable and durable.",108230,5
108230,"The fabric is a little thick for working out in summer, but perfect for fall, winter, and spring.",108230,5
108231,Such a great product!,108231,5
108231,I wear this jacket all the time!,108231,5
108231,!,108231,5
108232,"I bought those for my daughter, age 10.",108232,5
108232,"The only problem I have is that she wears them several days in a row, so I have to keep a close tab on her socks.. :(",108232,5
108233,Dress for perfect!,108233,5
108233,Fabric was so much nicer than I thought it would be and they replied so quickly to my emails!,108233,5
108233,Definitely would order from them again.,108233,5
108234,It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.,108234,5
108235,LOVED THESE BOOTS FROM THE MOMENT I PUT THEM ON....,108235,5
108236,These have been a great help with the plantar fascitis I have dealt with for 2 years.,108236,5
108236,They actually helped more than the cortisone shot in my heel.,108236,5
108237,awesome,108237,5
108238,I have hip problems so I certainly don't need anything bulky in my back pocket when I sit down.,108238,5
108238,"I tried another ""Slim"" cut wallet that was a little cheaper but when I put a couple of credit cards in there it blew up like the good-year blimp.",108238,5
108238,This wallet really stays slim.,108238,5
108238,The cards fit a little tight in the holders but there are other slots in the back that you can fit them in.,108238,5
108238,This is a great SLIM wallet just wish the leather was a little softer...,108238,5
108239,"They were a little long, however most things are for me as I am 5'3.",108239,5
108239,However they are perfect because of that fact.,108239,5
108239,"I originally bought them to use as a cosplay (Leafa from SAO), and was shocked at how nice they are.",108239,5
108239,I almost feel bad for turning them into shorts and false thigh highs.,108239,5
108240,The only thing I didn't like was that you could not get 1/2 sizes.,108240,5
108240,The ring works well for my husband since he is a police officer and cannot wear his white gold ring due to the nature of his job.,108240,5
108241,"My girlfriend and I are big into cosplay and general costuming, so we buy a lot of fun stuff.",108241,5
108241,"Recently, we've been enjoying outfits with lights and we've had good experiences with this seller's products.",108241,5
108241,I can honestly say that this is probably the best light-up product I've purchased.,108241,5
108241,"It's not the most flashy, of course; you can buy crazy masks and hats and all kinds of things if you really want to draw attention to yourself.",108241,5
108241,"However, this hoodie is comfortable, bright, and fits well.",108241,5
108241,"I've found that some light-up products really sacrifice comfort for looks, which is hard if you're going to be wearing the damn thing for hours.",108241,5
108241,"This one feels like a regular hoodie and fits like you'd imagine it would (I purchased the large because there was no medium option, so I expected it to be a bit big on me, which it is--I'm kinda skinny--but I imagine that smaller options will be coming soon).",108241,5
108241,"Anyway, one of the coolest features about this is how they've wired the control panel.",108241,5
108241,"It's basically hidden inside the inner pocket where you'd put your hands, but the panel is actually in a small area *inside* the jacket, so your hand isn't constantly bumping into the control switch if you like to put your hands in the pockets.",108241,5
108241,"To get to the panel, you just invert the bottom of the hoodie and you can then remove the switch easily.",108241,5
108241,Pretty great.,108241,5
108241,"Otherwise, the hoodie takes two AA batteries.",108241,5
108241,"I have the blue version and it's bright, noticeable, but not something that is going to offend people standing ten feet away.",108241,5
108241,The accents are good and the hood itself fits well.,108241,5
108241,"The light, despite being close to your face, won't blind you (though admittedly blue is a cool color; maybe a bright yellow would be more intense).",108241,5
108241,"I haven't worn the hoodie long enough to drain the batteries at this point, but it's lasted quite a bit just on the two AA's so far.",108241,5
108241,"As with most light-up things, the control switch makes a very slight buzzing sound, but it's inside the hoodie in that little pocket I described, so unless you're sitting in a total silent room playing chess with one of the dudes from Tron, you won't notice it.",108241,5
108241,"Overall, great product, fair price for the quality.",108241,5
108241,Check it out!,108241,5
108242,"nice product, arrives as expected.",108242,5
108242,my daughter in law loves it.,108242,5
108243,Favorite brand of pajamas!,108243,5
108244,Definitely not a dress!,108244,5
108244,"I am 5'3"" and it fits me as a shirt.",108244,5
108244,"However, that being said..it's SO cute and I love the material.",108244,5
108244,I have about 4 of these now and I love them.,108244,5
108244,Very cute shirts.,108244,5
108244,:),108244,5
108245,Very pretty belly chain.,108245,5
108245,"I'm 5'5, 175 lbs and I bought it to help disguise my stomach and I love it.",108245,5
108245,I didn't check the dimensions of the chain so it sits a lot higher on me that the picture shows but I am very happy with it!,108245,5
108246,My 4 yo son goes to the car show with me.,108246,5
108246,He loves daddy's mustang.,108246,5
108246,He won't stop wearing his jacket.,108246,5
108247,Had bought these for myself.,108247,5
108247,Loved them so much bought them for everyone in the family.,108247,5
108248,This is one solid shoe horn.,108248,5
108248,"And not that it's really that important, the color is awesome.",108248,5
108248,It works really well and if you have a really tight situation it doesn't bend or feel like it's going to break at all.,108248,5
108248,I have one with a hollow handle and a plastic horn.,108248,5
108248,It is really scary to use because it gives and you are just waiting for it to snap.,108248,5
108248,Which is why I purchased this one.,108248,5
108248,It did not disappoint.,108248,5
108249,I love them.,108249,5
108249,I'll be ordering more,108249,5
108250,Very nice quality!,108250,5
108250,Looks great!,108250,5
108251,Beautiful,108251,5
108252,"super fun socks, a little short but I still rock them to work and everyone loves them!",108252,5
108253,Love it!,108253,5

108254,I love it!,108254,5
108254,I'll buy more.,108254,5
108255,loved it colors are not the same but a beautiful bathing suit!,108255,5
108256,I bought this jacket after already owning the slightly heavier version (Triton) that has a hood (that I use as my rain coat) so that I could use this as my every day jacket.,108256,5
108256,"I wanted the blue color (since I couldn't find a black/charcoal one) but they didn't sell it in XL, so I had to buy a large.",108256,5
108256,"My XL of the Triton fits large enough that I would have expected the large to be a perfect fit for not needing room for lots of layers underneath, but it is just a bit too snug.",108256,5
108256,"I REALLY like the jacket, but would not be comfortable enough every day in a large.",108256,5
108256,I will pass this one off to my brother and have to look at getting a green XL.,108256,5
108257,This is a very pretty charm.,108257,5
108257,It is not an authentic Pandora friend charm but comes at a fraction of the cost.,108257,5
108257,It does have very good workmanship and you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference just from looking at it on a bracelet.,108257,5
108257,Most Pandora brand Charms have a threaded Center hole that will not allow them to go past the spacers on the bracelet.,108257,5
108257,The hole in this one is larger and it will slide over them.,108257,5
108257,If you have a certain organization to your bracelet or just want to keep them from falling off the end you will need a spacer or at least cap the end with an official charm.,108257,5
108258,Excellent all round .,108258,5
108258,A terrific service .,108258,5

108279,"I'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs and it fit fabulously.",108279,5
108279,The skirt has an elastic band so I would say that it can fit to be even bigger.,108279,5
108279,The shirt fit well but the sleeves where a little too puffy for my arms but it was cute anyway.,108279,5
108279,"I love the apron that it came with, it was adorable and is definitely a  piece I can see myself using with other outfits.",108279,5
108279,"The only downside I had was with the bow on the collar, I had to safety pin it on and that was a struggle.",108279,5
108279,"Overall I loved this product, the material was good for the price, just air it out before because it'll come smelling like the plastic wrap it comes in.",108279,5
108280,Love using them with my makeup business!,108280,5
108281,Very pretty dainty bracelet.,108281,5

108376,The fabric is heavy but breathable and the shape of this is so flattering.,108376,5
108376,I did need to wear an undershirt because I have a large bust but I think a lot of people could get away with pinning it if it's too low cut for their tastes.,108376,5

108389,"They are also the best length for capris as they don't stop right after the knee, they go down a bit farther on your leg.",108389,5
108389,They're also silky in texture which I wasn't expecting but they are so comfy and cool!,108389,5

108400,I tried several heel guards and didn't have much luck.,108400,5
108400,For two pairs of heels (with different size heels) finding a guard proved to be challenging.,108400,5
108400,What worked with these is that they are made out of a flexible plastic so you have a little give.,108400,5
108400,The other heels guards were hard plastic so you either got an exact fit or you were out of luck.,108400,5

108413,I bought this dress for my oldest daughter to wear in my upcoming wedding.,108413,5
108413,"One thing I need to mention, the color says ""hunter green"", but it looks to be aqua (my main color is Tiffany blue) in the above picture.",108413,5
108413,"However, upon arrival, we compared this color to the other gowns I had purchased and this is actually more of a mint green.",108413,5
108413,"I felt I needed to mention that so if you are looking for an aqua colored gown, this is not aqua but more mint.",108413,5
108413,"While I was hoping it was more aqua, I will not be returning it because it is beautiful and it was a custom-made piece.",108413,5
108413,I will just deal with the color difference.,108413,5

108413,"I may have to get it taken in a bit, but that's okay.",108413,5
108413,The communication was excellent and they were quick to answer all my emails in a timely manner.,108413,5
108413,I bought this gown on a Saturday afternoon and we were given an estimated delivery date of the first week of June.,108413,5
108413,"However, the dress arrived less than 2 weeks AFTER ordering it.",108413,5
108413,Talk about fast!,108413,5
108413,And this was for a customized gown!,108413,5
108413,This purchase was definitely a bargain considering how fast it came and how beautiful it is.,108413,5
108413,"The dress is not a lightweight dress, but it's not heavy like a bridal gown either.",108413,5
108413,"It does have a bit of a train, meaning it's longer in the back.",108413,5
108413,"It's a very pretty, flowing gown and my daughter is one very happy gal.",108413,5

108414,Very very comfortable sweater that I know she's going to love.,108414,5
108414,It was very soft and the only itchy part was inside the pockets.,108414,5

108423,"I am 6'5"" with a large build.",108423,5
108423,"I ordered two sizes bigger than I would normally for other amazon shirts, and although that made the sleeves adequate length the arms were tight and body length such that it could only be worn ""un-tucked"".",108423,5
108423,"I was disjointed a bit as the shirt is VERY NICE linen and super comfortable, but my disappointment turned to complete satisfaction with their customer service contacting me within 24 hrs and assuring me that they would make this right in any way I felt fair.",108423,5
108423,This kind of customer service is so rare it humbled me.,108423,5
108423,"In any case, if you are tall, bulky in the arms and chest, or husky I would suggest the XXXL.",108423,5
108423,These shirts are a great value compared to comparable quality I have bought from retailers and other suppliers on Amazon,108423,5

108929,"Excellent quality; thick, warm and roomy.",108929,5
108930,awesome deal for the price - fit and feel great I got two pair both in the asian xl ( I wear a 34 waist) - The brown and white plaid are very soft and a bit thicker than the black and as noted in other reviews they are different fabrics.,108930,5
108930,The black one has floral print mesh part on the knees is also on the back near the waist which is kinda weird.,108930,5

108942,And the answer is Jesus.,108942,5
108942,"So when someone comments how much they like it, it gives me the opportunity to tell my story.",108942,5

108949,"It was just slightly longer than I really wanted - I was looking for just below the knee and this is maybe two inches longer than that - and I'm 5'7"" - and I was thinking about hemming it up but with the petticoat it gets lifted a little.",108949,5
108949,"Still, you may want to hem yours to a different length.",108949,5

108951,"I expect any casual shoes to be much too wide, but these are easily adjustable thanks to the multiple Velcro tabs.",108951,5
108951,"The color doesn't appear clearly in the photo, but it is perfect for wearing with just about anything short of formal dress or business where sandals in general wouldn't do.",108951,5
108951,These have gold flecks on a light tan background rather than being mostly gold.,108951,5
108951,"The fact that the soles are wide and sturdy makes them particularly appropriate for any person who has difficulty walking, but they don't appear fat and ugly once worn--unlike many sandals with rubber soles.",108951,5

109341,Watch came as expected and looks as beautiful in person as it does in the picture.,109341,5

109363,Color and material is very nice.,109363,5
109364,"Great size, held everything including jewelry!",109364,5
109365,Very nice look and material.,109365,5
109365,"Fits good, with just enough room for a sweatshirt if you want one.",109365,5
109366,excellent,109366,5
109367,Love this hat.,109367,5
109367,I am so obsessed with hats and the corduroy is perfect!,109367,5
109368,Perfect size and great bright red color!,109368,5
109368,Fits easily wherever you want it to.,109368,5
109369,Cute and fun.,109369,5
109369,Love the colors!,109369,5
109370,The material was a good stiff wool and fit my medium head just fine.,109370,5
109370,"The top has a few vent holes to keep your head a bit cooler, but let's face it, Fezes are cool even without the holes.",109370,5
109370,I wore this to a Disneyland party all night and never felt that it was going to fall off while walking around.,109370,5
109370,It is also of a decent quality that I was able to compress it into a pouch or pocket to go on rides.,109370,5
109370,It's a good looking piece and got lots of compliments from Whovians.,109370,5
109370,Cheers!,109370,5
109371,I bought this to hold my hair band and it works quite well.,109371,5
109371,The hair band does pop out when I put on or take off my coat but it's not a big deal.,109371,5
109371,Its also a nice looking bracelet of it's own accord.,109371,5
109371,I have quite small wrists and this bracelet bends easily so I was able to fit it to my wrist with ease.,109371,5
109371,This maybe wouldn't work for men or women with thicker wrists.,109371,5
109371,I would recommend or buy again.,109371,5
109372,"I have one earlobe that sags in my old age, even though it was professionally reconstructed, but the surgery failed so that I had to have my lobe re-pierced at a mall store.",109372,5
109372,"These work wonderfully, as seen on QVC, with heavier earrings, to keep them in place on a tired lobe.",109372,5
109372,"I was surprised and delighted to hear that they are available for sale separately from the Honora earring sets (the regular ones which I have purchased in the past), although it was difficult to track down their availability.",109372,5
109372,"QVC could not help me get them in stock, but I finally called Honora directly and their customer service agent swiftly, efficiently, and kindly helped me get them.",109372,5
109372,"The only objection I have is that they are a little pricey, but well worth the investment for someone like myself.",109372,5
109373,Very pretty!,109373,5
109374,Wonderful!,109374,5
109374,As described!,109374,5
109375,Absolutely beautiful!,109375,5
109376,"I was a little nervous about ordering a one-size-fits-all skirt, but it fit my waist quite comfortably.",109376,5
109376,"The length is perfect for me, and the green color is similar to the picture, maybe a little less blue.",109376,5
109376,Overall what I expected for the price.,109376,5
109376,"Fit (Color:Green)
Length: I'm 5'8"", and this was perfect so that my feet peeked out at the bottom.",109376,5
109376,"Perfect for flats or low-heeled boots, not sure if it would look awkward with tall heels on me.",109376,5
109376,"Waist: My waist is somewhere around 29"" give or take on any given day, and this fit comfortably.",109376,5
109376,"I can get it up over my bum with some coaxing, but prefer to put it on over my head since it does fit snugly.",109376,5
109376,"Weight: On the lighter side (compared to one or two other brands I ordered), but perfect for warmer weather.",109376,5
109376,Giving this product 5 stars because it was as expected and fit well on me.,109376,5
109376,Jury's out on whether I'll keep it simply because I'm attempting to use it as part of a costume and match another more blue-green piece that I already own.,109376,5
109376,"If it matched the color, would definitely keep (but that's not the skirt or seller's fault).",109376,5
109377,I love this sweatshirt.,109377,5
109377,The inside is like a fleecy sorta texture thing (??,109377,5
109377,"), But it'd be perfect for winter.",109377,5
109377,Not so much summer unless you wanna sweat,109377,5
109378,This is seriously comfy and bery cute!!,109378,5
109378,!,109378,5
109379,Super cute onesie,109379,5
109380,I love how the out fit looks and feels great for summer as well because it gets a lot of air threw it over all I love it I just got it to big I thought I was smaller then I thought lol but its perfect,109380,5
109381,Love this piece.. it fits a smaller wrist too which is hard to find sometimes..,109381,5
109382,Fits great.,109382,5
109382,Feels great.,109382,5
109382,I lift weights and wear this to the gym.,109382,5
109382,has very very tiny almost unnoticeable marks after 4 months of daily gym visits which demonstrates the durability and scratch resistance of this material.,109382,5
109382,Had previously worn a Cobalt ring and after a couple weeks of normal everyday wear was completely scratched everywhere and was almost dull in sheen because of the scratched.,109382,5
109382,Tungsten holds up much better.,109382,5
109382,It is also easier to 'break' off your finger in case of emergency or swelling of the finger.,109382,5
109382,If I ever lose/damage/destroy this ring I will be purchasing another the very next day.,109382,5
109382,Very pleased with this purchase.,109382,5
109383,"fits as expected, amazing ring",109383,5

109384,I am totally in love.,109384,5
109384,Looks very high quality and easy to wear.,109384,5
109384,Bit pricey but worth the money.,109384,5
109385,My son loves this robe.,109385,5
109386,My mother-in-law was very pleased with this gift.,109386,5
109386,It was a good size and she loves it!,109386,5
109387,This purse is so amazingly worth this price.,109387,5
109387,"First, it's leather and feels like quality leather, so you don't have to worry about strings coming out of it or the surface rubbing off after a season of wear.",109387,5
109387,"Second, it fits so much in such a compact space, I'm surprised how much I can get in sometimes.",109387,5
109387,"It takes my kinda bulky wallet (but its the half sized ones), my iphone 6, a chapstick, a mascara or lippy, eyeliner, oh and then you have a couple stash pockets to put emergency things in.",109387,5
109387,"I prefer to just slip my card and cash in here and leave my wallet at home, but that's because wallets are annoying to take out.",109387,5
109387,"The strap is a comfortable length to wear as a cross body, but I honestly haven't tried to wear it any other way so I don't know about adjusting to other lengths.",109387,5
109387,"It goes with everything, it's simple and chic, just get one.",109387,5
109388,I love this blouse.,109388,5
109388,"In fact, I'm wearing it right now.",109388,5
109388,It is slightly smaller than some mediums but it fits me well.,109388,5
109388,"It is lined and has beautiful gold trim at the shoulders, and is very well made for the money.",109388,5
109389,"Perfect design, looks quite polished, it is a great item.",109389,5
109389,"Still, the packaging is not perfect because there are a lot of little pieces of the little rings that should have been between the grey teardrops, but it's not a big deal and a great plus is that these necklaces are really affordable.",109389,5
109389,Will buy again.,109389,5
109390,I like the look and fit.,109390,5
109390,"No problems with delivery, fit and price (other cargo pants I looked at were between $70-90, too high).",109390,5
109391,Used as pajamas.,109391,5
109391,Great.,109391,5
109392,"Nicest people in the world, that make an incredible bracelet.",109392,5

109394,He loves it but he won't use it for its purpose lol.,109394,5
109394,But he said he will be hanging it from his truck.,109394,5

109399,Exactly what was expected!,109399,5
109399,Loved it!,109399,5
109400,"This ring loos exactly as pictured, is very sturdy and strong, it feels different than 14k GOLD which the ring I lost was made of, this is heavier and more scratch and stain resistant, 8mm wide sounds big but it fits perfectly on an average male hand, I ordered size 10.5 and it was perfect.",109400,5
109400,"On a side note, I was lucky enough to find this ring that looks exactly like the one lost, only downside is that white Tungsten cannot be engraved easily.",109400,5
109401,My snow boots were pinching my toes and I love the boots.,109401,5
109401,This stretcher worked great.,109401,5

109405,It's kind of on the bigger side but it's not an issue to her.,109405,5
109406,Absolutely love this Parka.,109406,5
109406,It runs a little bit large but that's really what I wanted so I can wear heavier winter clothing underneath.,109406,5
109406,The parka is light weight and has kept me warm with a fleece jacket underneath.,109406,5
109406,The hood is the perfect size (on the small side) so I can still wear a hat underneath if needed.,109406,5
109406,Without a hat it keeps your head covered without completely covering your face so that can't see anymore.,109406,5
109407,Beautiful gold colored buckle and hard-to-find all white belt.,109407,5
109407,Great adjustable belt!,109407,5

109574,The ring is a little bigger then what I thought it would be but the pictures don't do justice at all to how pretty this ring actually is.,109574,5
109575,Perfect hat for my boys.,109575,5
109575,Easily adjustable and Perfect size.,109575,5

109576,fantastic product.,109576,5
109576,"yes, they are expensive and no, you won't be using them for long, but you just had a baby...out of your abdomen, so you deserve to spend a few extra bucks on anything that can make you more comfortable!",109576,5
109576,great amount of support and nothing that hits you anywhere tender.,109576,5
109577,Absolutely super way to set off my car keys and find them in my oversized purse.,109577,5
109578,Loved these!,109578,5
109578,"Had them for two years, just lost them, and want to get another pair...",109578,5

109579,"Depending on what you consider modest, and how big your boobs are, you will love this suit.",109579,5
109579,It felt great and was very flattering.,109579,5
109579,I love halter neck lines because it makes shoulders and my whole top half look more slender.,109579,5
109579,But sometimes the straps cut into my shoulders from the weight.,109579,5
109579,Not so with this because of the actual bra support built into the suit.,109579,5
109579,I could undo the straps to nurse my baby and the cups would not fall down because of the fitted underwire bra!!!,109579,5
109579,It was great!,109579,5
109579,"However, this suit definitely accentuates the bust.",109579,5
109579,If I hadve been with a crowd of one piece swimsuit friends or ladies much less curvy than me I might've felt uncomfortable with such accentuated boobies.,109579,5
109579,But I was with family and all the ladies were slender and were wearing bikinis and I felt like my busty tankini was great for my mom-body but still looked cute and not old and boring.,109579,5
109579,":)

Overall the fit is great and very secure.",109579,5
109579,It hides tummy fluff and makes the girls look great.,109579,5
109579,"I also like how it comes down lower than I expected and almost gave a slight skirt/A-line look to distract from my untoned chubby upper thighs in the crotch area, but the back was still short enough to show a bit of my butt so you could tell it wasn't a swim dress or one piece.",109579,5
109579,I got the matching bottoms which I also love!,109579,5
109579,Shapewear-ish high waisted matching bottoms!,109579,5

109588,Nice quality shirt.,109588,5
109588,Fit is a little boxy so for me it is a tad big but definitely wearable.,109588,5

109597,I'm 5'4 and a size 14 and the length was was just right.,109597,5
109597,I am a borderlike 34/36 and am glad I went 36 for the increased width on the torso.,109597,5

109824,"Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",109824,5
109824,I purchased this particular style in different colors.,109824,5
109824,"The colors are vibrant, the cardigans are soft and just the right thickness to be worn throughout every season.",109824,5
109824,"The fit is pretty true to size (I am 5'1 , 150 lbs and a 38K and the XL works great!)",109824,5
109824,I am able to button them if I choose but I prefer to wear them open since layers look better on my frame.,109824,5

109825,I used the same solution I used for the screen protector I got from IQ shield to apply my slickwrap skin.,109825,5

109868,Regular pants seem to always fall into two categories: too tight in the butt/thighs or way too loose (Relaxed fit) and baggy making me feel even shorter and dumpier.,109868,5
109868,These fit perfect and have a nice stretch material to them.,109868,5
109868,"My wife says they fit me well and look good on me, and she was quite happy to see me finally ditch the baggy relaxed-fit look.",109868,5

109983,Started with a medium right after I delivered my baby and about 3 weeks later I ordered the small that I can now wear for the next couple weeks.,109983,5
109983,I was 150 when I got pregnant and gained 30 pounds and now I am 155 and the belly bandit really helped.,109983,5
109983,I still have a little pooch that will only go away with diet and exercise.,109983,5
109984,"Original review written for the red swimsuit, adendom below for additional purchase:

5'7, 145lbs, 34F, size 6

Swimsuit runs small...",109984,5
109984,But I anticipated that given the image.,109984,5
109984,Top and bottoms dead on to image provided.,109984,5
109984,"Quality, thick material.",109984,5
109984,Bottoms are too small for me but being a wide hipped curvy girl I knew I was rolling the dice with this one.,109984,5
109984,Overall great quality and image representation.,109984,5
109984,This product delivers what is advertised.,109984,5
109984,"***Ordered the blue***

Same quality and true to image consistency HOWEVER, the red bottoms ran super small.",109984,5
109984,"I ordered a Large again anticipating them to be right just like the first swimsuit I ordered but in stark contrast, the bottoms fit loose.",109984,5
109984,I'm a little nervous once wet they may not stay put.,109984,5
109984,"Overall, still a great product.",109984,5
109984,"The size discrepancy is somewhat anticipated -- even when I buy the same brand jeans, I know I have to try each pair on bc of this minor variation.",109984,5
109984,I will 100% order this again.,109984,5
109985,Comfy,109985,5
109986,Very cute.,109986,5
109986,Would buy it in black if they had it.,109986,5
109987,very pretty !,109987,5
109988,Can fit so much more than the quart plastic zip backs and not as wasteful constantly having to replace them.,109988,5
109988,"While I have precheck, and rarely have to take my liquids out of my bag, this bag is perfect for when I have to.",109988,5
109989,These have great arch support woke still being flexible enough for comfort during running and hiking.,109989,5
109990,I have used an Allett classic ripstop for almost 15 years and while it didn't wear our it was getting a little ragged in one corner.,109990,5
109990,If you want one of the best built thin wallets available I can highly recommend the classic ripstop.,109990,5
109990,I upgraded to leather because I wanted to and RFID because it couldn't hurt.,109990,5
109990,I do not have an RFID credit card but I do carry an RFID passport card when traveling internationally.,109990,5
109990,This wallet is an improvement over the original.,109990,5
109990,The leather has a nice feel and appearance and is on the outside only adding little to overall thickness.,109990,5
109990,The nylon interior includes a layer inside the leather and appears to be where RFID blocking wires are interwoven.,109990,5
109990,One notable improvement over the original design is the depth of the card slots which now provide 90% coverage.,109990,5
109990,This combined with the leather and more substantial nylon suggests cards are less likely to fall out.,109990,5
109990,If this holds out when the wallet is broken in it is a noteworthy improvement.,109990,5
109991,love these beaded chain.,109991,5
109991,I can hook more than one to get my desired length and they haven't come loose or broken.,109991,5
109991,they stay hooked toeghter.,109991,5
109992,Awesome chain looks like silver error army bead u would get with dog tags  but gold I love it been wearing quite some time no prob at all no tarnish .great length and can cut if to long .awesome.,109992,5
109993,Thank you very much,109993,5
109994,This ring is absolutely beautiful.,109994,5
109994,Looks sort of real and the color is vibrant.,109994,5
109995,"Fits perfect, I'm thin and long.",109995,5
109995,"It stretches and shows ""little"" panty line which should be expected for a tight dress.",109995,5
109996,Love the material!,109996,5
109997,Received on time and looks and fits as expected.,109997,5
109997,Too cute and comfortable.,109997,5
109998,"I love this hat, it would fit anyone and shows how to be a real patriot.",109998,5
