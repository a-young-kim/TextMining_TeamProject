136,I didn't notice the measurements are in cm not inches.,136,1
136,"I bought it thinking it would be loose like they described and saw the measurements, but didn't see cm.",136,1
136,It is so small I couldn't even get it over my head.,136,1
136,These foreign companies selling to Americans need to state these are Asian sizes and run small and measure clothing in inches if you're selling to America.,136,1
136,We don't use cm for clothing.,136,1
137,This fit as if I was some Maury show guest trying to determine who my child's father was.,137,1
138,Definitely not true to size.,138,1
138,I normally wear a small/medium and ordered a large in this and it is so tiny it fits my 10 year old daughter.,138,1

139,I actually laughed out loud when I tried it on.,139,1
139,It looked like sheer see through rags hanging around.,139,1
139,Ridiculous!,139,1
139,"It shipped from China, so when I tried to return it she suggested I just keep it and she send me part of my money back.. again Ridiculous!",139,1
139,"Especially since the address that this supposedly returned to was on Forest Lane in Dallas Texas, which is 5 blocks from my job!",139,1
139,"But I drove by and was unable to locate a store front/office space at the listed address, very shady indeed.",139,1
140,It was too small.,140,1
141,"I just got my dress today and it looks nothing like the picture or description, it's a one shoulder strap dress with frills only toward one direction.",141,1
141,The worst part is that the pictures and description say it is lace up but it has a side zipper poorly attatched.,141,1
141,"If you're wanting a safe bridesmaid dress option, please do not buy this dress.",141,1
142,"First of all, I ordered control-top and got support.",142,1

146,"It says 100% cotton, it was not cotton at all but 100% lycra.",146,1
146,"My daughter is a 5 year old japanese girl, so we ordered a 5/6T, to try to order it larger than her.",146,1
146,This item would tightly fit for a four year old.,146,1
146,"It was a weird, tight, reflective piece of clothing, and not the cotton t-shirt we paid for.",146,1
146,A full two sizes too small and not the listed material.,146,1
146,And why on earth of all the things we ordered for christmas did this come last of all?,146,1
146,We can see on the label it came directly from China to Japan in a plastic pouch (no box even).,146,1
146,"The items we ordered from America all got here sooner, some ordered as late as a week ago.",146,1
146,They couldn't have got one more thing wrong it seems.,146,1

154,Horrible.,154,1
154,No allowance for normal shoulders or hips.,154,1
154,Gave it to my 10 yr old.,154,1

178,Not just in the waist but in the legs.,178,1

178,I'm very disappointed with my purchase and warn you lovely ladies that the fit is small and cuts off circulation to your ankles if you manage to tolerate the squeeze.,178,1
178,"Best of luck, dears.",178,1
179,Wasn't what I expected.,179,1
179,The label doesn't even say Joe's.,179,1

194,So I LOVED THE LOOK OF THIS BAG SO MUCH!!,194,1
194,"However, the company has Terrible customer service, and must have used sub standard hardware.",194,1
194,"I REALLY was so excited to get this in the mail...I'm a purse and bag collector, my husband calls it an addiction  so this bag got me excited when I saw it on another web site, plus on TV.",194,1

273,the material would not give at all and i could not even put one arm in it and i ordered a size larger than i wear i had to give it away to someone way smaller than me .,273,1
273,I wear a Med.,273,1
273,and i order a large i believe I don't think I could have worn an extra large that is how small it would have been,273,1
274,"Bought this to go in my Louis Vuitton bag, and it collapsed and would stand up to hold anything.",274,1
274,"Just ended up piling things on top of it, instead of keeping things organized inside it.",274,1

277,Smh!,277,1
278,I purchased this top in a XXL and I was completely amazed when I received the top (which by the way took almost a month).,278,1
278,The inside tag read XXL but the top looked like it could fit a small child!,278,1
278,I decided to try the top on anyways but I couldn't even get it over my shoulders!,278,1
278,"Needless to say, I ended up giving the top to one of my younger cousins, who may I add is a size 2.",278,1
278,She says that the top fits fine.,278,1
278,So I will not purchase anything from this seller again!,278,1
278,I would have given it zero stars if not for the fact that I had to rate something.,278,1
278,"On a positive note, I will say that the shirt looks just like the picture.",278,1
279,"Buyer Beware--- This tie is orange and a mix of maroon and brown, not red and black!",279,1
279,"I saw one other review saying the color was off, I decided to try anyway.",279,1
279,Wish I had not.,279,1
279,"It is not the colors showing in the pictures, and I even checked pictures on two different monitors!",279,1
279,Waste of money!,279,1
280,Could not use it as the clasp broke after 1 day without using it!,280,1
281,Size is not accurate,281,1
282,"The description of these ""pants"" states that they are heavy weight fleece.",282,1
282,They are not.,282,1
282,They aren't even pants.,282,1
282,They are footless tights.,282,1
282,They are nylon in texture.,282,1
283,This is not a mask but a flat cut out that may fit someone with a very large head..,283,1
284,Did not like anything about this skirt.,284,1
284,The material was really cheap looking and the fit was terrible.,284,1
284,Way too small.,284,1
284,Returned it for a full refund.,284,1
285,Really disappointed with this shirt.,285,1
285,It was a gift and I ended up buying two other items from JC Penney to make up for the poor quality of this shirt.,285,1
285,"Flimsy and thin, it looks like it should be hand washed as a delicate.",285,1
285,"The stitching around the edges, arm holes, hems, etc is horrid.",285,1
285,"It's a simple, loose serge stitch, like you might find in the lining of a coat before the hem was stitched.",285,1
285,Certainly not anything you would want to be exposed where someone could see it.,285,1
285,As soon as I opened the tiny little sandwich bag it came in my stomach dropped.,285,1
285,I paid $24 for a hankie with arm holes and cats on it.,285,1
285,"Speaking of the cats, that's the only good thing I can say about it.",285,1
285,"The cats were really cute, which just heightened my disappointment.",285,1
285,"Overall, I wasted my money on this one, and it was too close to Christmas to send it back.",285,1
285,Shrug.,285,1
285,Live and learn I guess..,285,1
286,Poor metal quality.,286,1
286,Not at all like the picture.,286,1
287,Cheap looking dress when seeing it in person.,287,1
287,Skirt is a few layers of see through tulle with a underskirt of cheap material that stopped mid calf and looked ridiculous.,287,1
287,Looks nothing as elegant as the picture.,287,1
287,"Ours arrived inside out in the package, marked as NEW but had no tags on the dress.",287,1
287,Was going to use it for prom but shipped it back right away.,287,1
287,Extremely disappointed!,287,1
288,Buyers BEWARE!!!!,288,1
288,This is not a Borgasets wallet.,288,1
288,I received mine and there is no emblem and it is tearing inside.,288,1
289,Too small and a button was missing and one had fallen off in the bag,289,1
290,The material feels like a windbreaker or raincoat.,290,1
290,Feels and looks very cheap; wanted to return but shipping cost would be close to the price of shirt.,290,1
290,I donated it.,290,1
291,The quality is good enough for the price but the sizing is not US size.,291,1
291,I got the XL and it fit like a medium.,291,1
291,"But if they would have fit, I would have totally worn them.",291,1
292,Looks nothing like the display!,292,1
293,To small,293,1
294,They suggest sizing up - go up 2 sizes!,294,1
294,"I ordered a medium for an average American 12 year old girl, and sadly it was still way too small.",294,1
295,Super flimsy,295,1
296,This dress was awful!,296,1
296,"It looks nothing like the picture, fits 2 sizes bigger than the sizing chart, is extremely long, the padded bra is to low, and the dress looks cheaply made.",296,1
296,I do not reccomend this dress for anyone.,296,1
297,Very poor quality.,297,1
297,The paint on the frames peels of after some time.,297,1
297,The hinges are poor.,297,1
297,I would not recommend this item.,297,1
298,runs really small.,298,1
298,need to order at least 1 size up,298,1
299,So it was a good price but I got a medium and I got a medium and it doesnt even for my arms.,299,1
299,If you aren't a naturally small person order extra big.,299,1
300,"If it was possible I wouldn't even give this 1 star, I'd give it 0 stars.",300,1
300,"Upon receiving my order, the jumpsuit looked nothing like the picture.",300,1
300,"I ordered a large, but it looks more like a cross between a small and a medium and the top half of the suit is very short.",300,1
301,Magnets aren't strong enough to go through more than 4 bills and an ID or credit card.,301,1
301,"Also, Magnets fell out third day I had it,  and the whole mechanism where it unfolds is janky and feeble.",301,1
301,"Don't waste your money, I'm pissed and want my money back.",301,1
302,Broke the day I used it.,302,1
302,Don't waste that money whether.,302,1
302,50 cents or 500 don't just throw money out,302,1
303,"I really liked the color, the multiple compartments, etc.",303,1
303,"However, I'd had the bag about a month and the metal claw device that holds the strap onto the bag broke.",303,1
303,Totally unusable now.,303,1
303,I wasn't carrying a laptop or other heavy stuff in the bag either.,303,1

311,This necklace was nice but it continues to come undone.,311,1
312,Hidious and very cheaply made.,312,1
313,I have been with Amazon since 2007 and I have loved every single item I have ever purchase.,313,1
313,I have to say this was by far the worst thing I have ever purchased the description was misleading and it was unflattering and hard to understand the torso part of the outfit.,313,1
313,"I had the item for 5 mins before I issued a return request, I will never buy this again",313,1
314,Interior lining ripped after only one week.,314,1
315,This is a very thin shirt.,315,1
315,T-shirt material that I thought from the picture was more of a sweater.,315,1
315,The sleeves are impossibly small.,315,1
315,More like for a child than an adult.,315,1
315,It is not for a short girl as the back goes down to the middle of my calf.,315,1
315,I am 5'.,315,1
316,Don't plan on wearing this as a regular pant outside it would be a big fail.,316,1

321,!,321,1
322,Don't even bother.,322,1
322,Considering the price I knew it would be nothing special so I ordered it as a swim suit cover up.,322,1
322,"It was even worse than I expected, it is so cheaply made that I didn't even use it as a cover up, it is now a paint shirt for my daughter.",322,1
323,"It fit, but not like in the picture.",323,1

329,Way too small of a hoop.,329,1
329,Doesn't fit for a small/medium sized nose.,329,1
330,Lesson learned!,330,1
330,I wear one size hats (actual size can be small-medium) but these beanies and stocking caps from Asia are ridiculous.,330,1
330,"I have thin, fine hair, about shoulder blade length and this fits like a stocking cap.",330,1
330,"Its not slouchy, loose or the heavy knit like shown.",330,1

331,Never buy from this company.,331,1
331,Cheap material.,331,1
332,Not the best quality.,332,1
332,The clasp was not centered so this did not allow my necklace to lay in the center,332,1

337,"Also, my dress came tattered/damaged.",337,1
338,This was made for a petite body frame even if your small this is small..,338,1
338,It runs like seven year old small for a small adult,338,1

340,"I loved the style of this hoodie, and arrived a lot sooner than expected but I did not get what is pictured.",340,1
340,"Its the same light grey I wanted but the detailing of the leather chest piece is completely different than pictured, actually all of the leather pieces are a different shape than in this picture, and the draw strings are frayed.",340,1
340,Also in the back picture it shows exposed string going through the hood with leather and my did not have this at all.,340,1
340,I usually wear a medium to large in sweatshirts so because of other reviews I ordered a size up and got the xl and it was way to small.,340,1
340,"I'm 5'7"" and 150lbs and while the sweatshirt does stretch a bit I couldn't zip it all the way past my bust.",340,1
340,The sleeves came well about my wrists.,340,1
340,I felt like I was trying to fit into children's clothing.,340,1
340,I don't really have anything positive to say about the sweatshirt itself.,340,1
340,Only positive was that it arrived well before the expected time.,340,1
340,Expected time Jan 22 - Feb9 and I received it Jan 5 and ordered Dec 23.,340,1
341,Fit very small.,341,1
341,I'm a size 14 and my 4yr old wears them now for his Captain America costume.,341,1
341,"They are a little baggy on him, but they don't fall off.",341,1
341,Definitely runs very small.,341,1
341,The quality is also questionable.,341,1
341,They got snagged on something and now there is a run in the fabric like a pair of pantyhose would do.,341,1

342,It's nothing fancy but it was comfortable.,342,1
342,Ordered the white one and it has no size or liable sewn into it.,342,1

347,Cheaply made and there were barely  any sparkles left on it upon opening.,347,1
348,"its baby blue and white, not the color pictured.",348,1
348,I ordered a large and the top part probably reached the bottom of my breasts.,348,1
348,"i felt like it was a suit for a 10 year old,, as far as sizing, other than that it was flattering, for a petite figure",348,1
349,THERE IS MATERIAL METAL LIKE SUBSTANCE ON THE POST SO IT WON'T EVEN GO INTO MY TINY LITTLE PIERCED EAR,349,1
350,Very odd fit in the bust.,350,1
350,Don't waste your money.,350,1

351,I tried hers on and loved it.,351,1
351,I bought the exact same size and everything and it's completely different.,351,1
351,I've attached a picture.,351,1
351,The first shirt in the picture is the one I received.,351,1
351,I ordered a size large.,351,1
351,It's huge and way too short.,351,1
351,I look like a fat girl trying to pull off an awkward crop top.,351,1
351,It flares on the bottom.,351,1
351,The shirt is very thin.,351,1
351,The lace is white and not the pretty beige color that is on the model.,351,1
351,The second shirt pictured is the one my sister received.,351,1
351,It fits really well and is the right color and the shirt is thicker.,351,1
351,"But, I wouldn't order this shirt, you never know which one you will end up with.",351,1
351,Very disappointed with my purchase.,351,1
352,Too cheap looking.,352,1
352,Not at all what we expected.,352,1
352,Will never buy from this retailer again.,352,1
353,Cheap,353,1
354,fell apart in 2 days,354,1
355,These pants are cheaply made.,355,1
355,There is no real waist band to hold the pants up.,355,1
355,Total waste of money.,355,1
356,I ordered this to take on a trip.,356,1
356,"I didn't try it on right way, because I stupidly assumed that given its brand name, it would be fine.",356,1
356,The elastic in the sleeves is ridiculously tight to the point that it hurts to wear it.,356,1
356,And I have skinny arms.,356,1
356,"Sadly I waited too long to return, so it's going to Good Will",356,1
357,It's definitely doesn't look like what's show on the picture!,357,1
358,DON'T EVER ORDER PRODUCTS FROM ASIA without upsizing.,358,1
358,"This shirt was XL, yeah, a junior's XL.",358,1
358,I gave it to my daughter.,358,1
358,Lesson learned.,358,1
359,"too small, can't even make our word written on it.",359,1
359,tried to send it back.,359,1
359,no co-operation from seller.,359,1
360,No durability.,360,1

363,This is a waste of money.,363,1
364,"was way to small, the size guard doesn't help at all.",364,1
365,I ordered the largest size and I got an outfit that was WAY TOO SMALL,365,1
366,won't purchase ever again,366,1
367,"Although the idea is great, the quality recalled stunk- I guess that is why it was so cheap.",367,1
367,I wouldn't recommend buying this for anyone over the age of 12.,367,1
367,The pearl was awkwardly shaped...not round or even oval and had no luster to it at all.,367,1
367,Good for a very young girl to open as a surprise.,367,1
368,Cheap product and cheap craftsmanship.,368,1
368,Will steer away from this sellers products.,368,1
368,Flimsy,368,1
369,Unfortunately this product wasn't at all like the photos or description.,369,1
369,"The coat was extremely short, my wife is only 5""8' and the coat was cut at right above the knees.",369,1
369,In all the photos it is extremely long and most reviews mentioned hemming or the fabric pooling on the floor.,369,1
369,Not sure if this was a mistake during creation or not.,369,1
369,Also the fabric was an extremely stiff material and did not flow as a normal long coat would.,369,1
369,Created an odd shape and feel to the coat as described by my wife.,369,1
369,No harm done though as Amazon and its sellers thankfully make it very easy for items to be returned.,369,1
369,"I'm assuming this is a once in a while case as others seem to be happy with their purchase, and the other reviews are what made me decide on purchasing this as a gift.",369,1
369,My advice would be to stick to the Prime options to ensure easy return.,369,1
370,Took forever to receive item.,370,1
370,4 sizes too small!!,370,1
370,"Not a true 3XL.......it fit my 4'11"" 120lb Asain grandma!",370,1
371,My hat was just delivered in a sealed plastic bag.,371,1
371,"When I opened it, I thought I saw a hair on it, so I held it up to the light.",371,1
371,I discovered many more human hairs stuck to the fabric on the inside of the hat.,371,1
371,"Obviously, my ""new"" hat was already worn before it was shipped to me.",371,1
371,I will be returning it without bothering to try it on.,371,1
372,Fabric is terrible and the sweater tore a hole within a week of having it.,372,1
372,If I could give it zero stars I would have.,372,1
373,Terrible!,373,1
373,Tiny and poorly made.,373,1
373,These are unwearable.,373,1
374,colour not the same as the picture.,374,1
374,material is cheap and doesn't look like pic,374,1

382,"Way to small, I ordered a size up and a no go at all.",382,1
382,I had to return it.,382,1

383,Did not fit comfortably at all and looked ridiculous.,383,1
384,I am 145 pounds and 5'5.,384,1
384,I ordered this outfit a size medium and it fitted like a scuba diving outfit.,384,1
384,Was very disappointed.,384,1
385,Disappointed that the blouse was too small and due to the cost of the shirt its not worth the shipping to send back.,385,1

417,But runs super small.,417,1

418,Tanks fit fine.,418,1
418,these are just regular tank tops with an opening to add inserts.,418,1
418,"I don't see what makes them ""maternity"" or ""nursing"" tanks.",418,1
418,"To nurse, I still have to pull down the arm strap.",418,1
418,They also smell very chemically when you first recieve them.,418,1
418,I had to wash them twice to get the smell out.,418,1
419,"Way too small, not denim at all.",419,1
419,Had to return,419,1

425,It was also dirty...there was a layer of dusty dirt all over it.,425,1
425,"I didn't even bother opening it, so I can't vouch for the durability.",425,1
425,"Although, I tend to think that if it was THAT damaged from shipping (box was fine, but there was a box of legos in the box with the umbrella) then it's not a very durable item.",425,1
426,"Not good at all, no support",426,1
427,This runs a little large.,427,1

429,Not comfortable.,429,1
430,False advertising.,430,1

430,They are not dark at all.,430,1
430,Do not buy them,430,1
431,"I've bought several other similar shoes, but these ones were terrible.",431,1
431,There were holes in them within a week of wear.,431,1
431,Other ones I've bought have at least lasted a couple months of daily wear by an active toddler before getting holes.,431,1
432,What a scam... NONE that it shows on the picture came.,432,1
432,They are definitely not what I ordered.,432,1

439,I was so excited to find these to use for my water aerobics.,439,1
439,They fit perfectly and were very comfortable but the first time I used them I only spent 30 minutes in the water and the bottoms were already scratched up and ripping  I'm very  disappointed.,439,1
439,I don't see these lasting much longer.,439,1

443,I waited a month to get this shirt too.,443,1
443,"It could have been a one-time mistake, but I was not satisfied at all.",443,1

449,But then the Velcro stopped working.,449,1
449,I've only washed it twice on cold water and hung to dry...so I think mine is defective?,449,1
449,"Anyway because it's been more than 30 days since I purchased, i called amazon and They said I can't get replacement band.",449,1
449,At this much money I would expect the product to work through my entire pregnancy.,449,1

452,Runs very small,452,1
453,Idk why foreign sellers keep marketing to the US.,453,1
453,Using an American looking model is just wrong.,453,1
453,I brought an XL that fit like a small.,453,1
453,Ridiculous!,453,1
454,Quite upset as I thought this was a high cut bikini as seen in the photo when really it is full coverage all over.,454,1

471,It is too thin and very loose,471,1
472,I am pretty sure these were not made to be worn by adult human ears...the post was too short on the screw on earrings.,472,1
472,"The gauge of the post for all the earrings was also larger than a regular post, so you would need to stretch you holes as well.",472,1

482,"There's a reason the model is covering the sleeve cuff, it's ugly!",482,1
483,"While this is a good looking wallet, the quality is a bit lacking.",483,1
483,The zipper will split open on occasion.,483,1
483,"Also, the credit card slot on one side began to come apart after a little over 1 month of use, just outside the return window.",483,1
484,"I doubt even a Barbie could fit into this and I'm 5'9"" and 120lbs",484,1

485,very poor quality.,485,1
485,looks like plastic.,485,1
486,"So, unbelievably, fake looking and ugly.",486,1
486,The hairs in the front are not long like that.,486,1
486,They go to about your chin and are thick strips that cannot be manipulated to go back with the rest of the hair to make it look more authentic.,486,1
486,One side of the wig wasn't even in a pony and WILL NOT cooperate and go into a pony tail.,486,1
486,"And I don't know whose head they use to measure, but I have a normal size head and have never had any problems with wigs, and this this was HUMOROUSLY too big for my head.",486,1

488,If i could do 0 stars i would have.,488,1
488,"I am 5'2 120lbs and this dress is see through, short, and NOTHING like the picture which i am so sad about because it is so cute online.",488,1
488,Im keeping it because it is too much of a hassle to send back but save your money and go with a different dress,488,1
489,The zipper kept getting stuck,489,1
490,Don't waste your money.,490,1
490,"This is not even close to being oversized, unless you're a Barbie doll.",490,1
490,"While it says it is spandex and cotton, I'm quite sure I've never had anything cotton smell like a chemical site before.",490,1
490,This top is horrible.,490,1
491,I went up 2 sizes actually and its still TOO SMALL!,491,1

492,"I would not recommend any one purchase this, Its not even worth spending money to send back.",492,1
493,Cross body strap broke when I tried to fit my stuff in it.,493,1
494,"Horrible quality, extremely overpriced, and useless after just a few weeks of using them in my walking shoes!!!",494,1
494,"I ordered these Powerstep inserts hoping they would be better than the Reebok ones in my shoes, and boy was I wrong!",494,1
494,These Powerstep inserts are pretty much useless after just a few weeks of use; I can't believe I paid over $20 for these!,494,1
494,"After the first week, the liner started to come undone, which was really aggravating because I could feel it kinking up under my heel.",494,1
494,"Then a few weeks later, the actual foam started to break up and off.",494,1
494,That's right!!!,494,1
494,The foam that is supposed to provide all this great support started to break off near the front of my left foot insert near the toes.,494,1
494,Horrible quality and build!,494,1
494,I wouldn't even pay $5 for this useless product.,494,1
494,"And in case you are wondering, I walk only....no running!",494,1
494,"That's right, they can't even handle a few weeks of walking without breaking!",494,1
494,I attached a picture of what they look like now...pathetic!,494,1
494,"I also ordered Powerstep Pinnacle Maxx inserts (for a whopping $26) at the same time, and they had the same issue; they also had the liner and foam go bad in just a few short weeks.",494,1
494,"So, I would recommend steering clear of Powerstep products, and try something else, unless you only need them to last 2-3 weeks.",494,1
494,I'm looking for an alternative now.,494,1
495,I want partial payment of  $5.,495,1

499,I am very disappointed.,499,1
500,The idea for the ring is nice.,500,1

500,The one star is for the used item and condition of used item.,500,1

504,Not for sensitive skin !,504,1
505,"So disappointed when instead of the size requested, 14-16, received a 3XL.",505,1

505,"With such an error, did not trust ""Happy Mama"" to send the correct size with a second chance.",505,1
505,Loved the idea and the visual but their attention to detail was not appreciated.,505,1
505,Returned the shirt and still waiting for a refund.,505,1
505,Elizabeth L. Brose,505,1
506,"This blouse was too small and the material feels like plastic, not easy to put on and off.",506,1

508,"they are really small not really sure what they are supposed to be used for, i have 4c afro",508,1

510,This shirt has snaps instead of buttons and the snaps are not attached well to the fabric.,510,1
510,Owned two of these neither lasted long.,510,1
510,Highly recommend buying the other Ogio shirts.,510,1

512,"Ships from China
No way to return or exchange
Cheaply made and the top part is too large falls off the shoulders",512,1
513,Awful sizing....came in child size,513,1
514,These were imitation no happy with the false advertisement at all,514,1
515,Very cheaply made,515,1
516,"I'm 5 foot 7 and the dress fit  way too short
Love them.",516,1
516,And the design just doesn't work for me,516,1
517,"Material does not give, but soft.",517,1
517,"However, runs small in the bust area.",517,1
517,sent it back!,517,1
518,This would be really cute if I could get it on.,518,1
518,"Doesn't stretch enough to even get it over my hips, and I am not a large gal (USA size 6).",518,1
518,Worse yet.,518,1
518,"it ships from China, so shipping it back is such a hassle that it isn't worth the $29.",518,1
518,Wish I had realized this before ordering.,518,1
518,"As it is, this is going to be a $29 donation to Goodwill.",518,1
518,Waste of money.,518,1
519,Somehow the Large was even smaller than the medium.,519,1
519,"If you have boobs, forget about buying this top.",519,1
519,"Unless you have a very narrow torso, good luck.",519,1
520,"This was not an adult size, it was obviusly for a child.",520,1
520,I hope this was a minor error at the warehouse and not an egregious error on the websites part.,520,1
521,I ordered my usually since that I wear even that it's came too large,521,1

527,Broke first time I tried it on,527,1
528,"Very disappointed they won't stay up on my ears like shown in the picture , very deceiving",528,1
529,"Very very very upsetting, the picture is completely misleading the lace isn't the same as in the picture, nor do the colors even match up right, Not only to say the sleeves are ridiculously long and the sewing on this dress looks like someone sewed it in the dark; the bottom of my lace had red and black thread that looked as if the dress got jammed into the sewing machine.",529,1
529,Then they just roll up the dress and shove it in a shipping bag that is entirely way to small.,529,1
529,You can see the lack of care that has been put into this dress,529,1
530,The post isn't long enough to go through my piercing and I have a small nose!,530,1

535,This is made of cheap nylon fabric.,535,1
535,This is knock off of a beautiful designer dress.,535,1
535,Also way too short to wear without leggings.,535,1
536,The dress/shirt does not fit as the model displays.,536,1
536,She must be a size 0.,536,1
536,"But for the rest of us 4,6 or size 8 ladies, be warned you will have to do ALOT of playing around with the dress to get it to look anything like the way the model is wearing the dress in the photo.",536,1
536,"So let me be clear, what you are ordering is really a very large shirt with a belt.",536,1
536,That is why I said you would have to do some playing around with the dress to get it look like the model.,536,1
536,"I wound not say do not order it, I would just say this dress is best suited for those that like playing with clothing.",536,1
537,"poor description on size, I ordered 2 sizes larger thinking it would be small but way worse..",537,1
538,Cheap feels like burlap,538,1
539,Too small,539,1
540,"Not much space, looks and feels cheap, overall not worth the money they're charging.",540,1
540,"I rarely give reviews but I felt like a real person, not hired to make them look good, should post a review.",540,1
541,Terrible!,541,1
541,After reading reviews I thought this woyld be great..the top was way to small and the torso way to big.,541,1
541,Beware as the cup sizes listed are wrong!,541,1

543,Doesn't fit the lg4 v10 really dissapointed,543,1

545,I am thoroughly disappointed!,545,1
545,"The picture shows the black leather slip-ons; however, the canvas slip-ons were delivered.",545,1
545,"Before ordering, I even double checked that the canvas version were a separate option that were labeled as such a s that the ones I ordered did in fact show a picture of the leather version.",545,1
545,Bummer.,545,1
546,I was very unhappy with my purchase.,546,1
546,The zipper kept getting stuck and the bag is low quality.,546,1

547,The top strap does not adjust at all!!,547,1
547,The straps over the arms adjust but the back strap clip together and has no adjustment.,547,1

552,The charm came off almost immediately.,552,1
552,I love the way this bracelet looks but can not wear it anymore since I don't know where the charm is.,552,1
553,"This material is not what it looks like, I received it and it was see threw and not like a maximum dress the way it looks",553,1
554,it's cute but it doesn't fit,554,1
555,"My son has only used Bobux shoes and they have proven to be sturdy, ergonomic and very durable.",555,1
555,"Though they are quite expensive, I compensate it by having just a pair of shoes and a pair of sandals for every size my son gets.",555,1
555,"Thus, each shoe is used by my son from Monday to Friday  for around four to five months.",555,1
555,The shoes get battered but they remain nice and comfortable the whole time.,555,1
555,This model was the exception.,555,1
555,"The first week of using them, they were all peeled in the front.",555,1
555,"After just two months of using them, both shoes had holes on the front!",555,1

655,way too small,655,1
656,Unfortunately the dress smelt like cigarettes and I had to return it.,656,1
656,The smell was just so strong.,656,1
657,at first long time to wait order and second wear one week and lost because lock was very simple not keeping and not work well....,657,1
658,VERY cheaply made!,658,1
658,"The straps come apart constantly & you have to continue reattaching them-plus it tears the material
Colors are enticing, but that is it",658,1
659,"This dress is advertised as navy, however, it is not navy.",659,1
659,It is more of a royal blue.,659,1
659,"Return was only within 30 days so unfortunately, unable to return.",659,1
660,Returned - at least 4 sizes too small - I wear a large(ordered XL) and this would fit a petite extra small.,660,1
661,It's a little big on me but not too much.but it doesn't matter because I'll never wear it in public.,661,1
661,It didn't look like the picture nor did it fit like the picture.,661,1
662,Picture makes it look longer does not cover neck,662,1
663,Buyer be ware... light pink and sorry screen print job,663,1
664,I was so excited to have this dress come in so I could wear it to family events!,664,1
664,"But sadly when I received it, it was completely see through on the sides, no back on the lace parts.",664,1
664,Just see through.,664,1
664,"I also noticed that there was absolutely no slip under the green part, making it completely see through again.",664,1
664,I find it weird that people are getting different variations of this dress!,664,1
664,I had my doubts but I bought it anyways.,664,1
664,Looks like I turned out to be one of those people thay got a bad one....will be returning it as soon as possible.,664,1
665,Don't waste your money with this seller.,665,1
665,The shirt was 4 days late.,665,1
665,Terrible quality.,665,1
665,"An ""XL"" fit like a small!",665,1
666,You get what you pay for...Looks cheap and way to small...I gave it to the kid across the street...,666,1
667,"Poor quality, looks nothing like photo",667,1
668,"Cheap fabric,thread hanging,ripped pocket,hood doesn't stay buttoned on.",668,1
669,nice style but run too small,669,1
670,Yuck!,670,1
670,"As one person mentioned, it is bathing suit material indeed.",670,1
670,It looks embarrassingly cheap as clothing to be worn out in public.,670,1
670,It even makes a cheap nylon sound when you touch it.,670,1
670,Also the inner lining is white (I ordered the black) so that makes it look weird too.,670,1
670,"I will keep it as a swimsuit coverup, but mostly because I hate returning things.",670,1
671,"This item is made for kids, not grown women.",671,1
671,Not worth sending back.,671,1
671,Not sweatshirt material.,671,1
672,Way too large.,672,1
672,Can't wear it without feeling like a clown.,672,1
672,I threw away the faux pearl backs and just use the front as earrings,672,1
673,"very poorly made, threads hanging off, see through, cheap fabric.",673,1
674,This shirt has very poor quality screen printing.,674,1
674,The feather print started to stick to itself on the shirt after the first wash and it is very easy to peal off.,674,1
675,"ordered small since I have a 33 "" waist.",675,1
675,"but these are too long, and the length has very little compression or tightness.",675,1

681,My son wears a 16.,681,1
681,I had bought this for a school event for him and which he needed to wear a Hawaiian shirt.,681,1
681,Unfortunately this was sized quite small.,681,1
681,He's not a husky and considered Slim.,681,1
681,I used their sizing chart and thought I had done this correctly.,681,1
681,Well if I did something is seriously wrong it barely came to his waist and as I said he's Slim and it fit on the tight side.,681,1
681,I only washed it and let it air-dry so he could not shrink in the dryer we did in the end make it work by putting a t-shirt under it and leaving it open.,681,1
681,Should you purchase this definitely go at least one size up and remember it's extremely Slim which for Hawaiian shirt is unusual because they're supposed to fit like a bowling shirt,681,1
682,The fit is terrible there is no way it could or would ever look like the picture side boob bottom boob boob everywhere except in the suit,682,1
683,Very Dissapointed Because it's Says 14g & it's Nowhere Near That Size  Plus it Looks Cheap,683,1
684,It looks like the straps will snap,684,1
685,"Not impressed , my dandelions had moisture in the glass ball and are all flat you can't even see them.",685,1
686,For a doll.,686,1

691,Its too bold.,691,1
691,Definitely not for women.,691,1
691,It could overcome you.,691,1
691,More for big men!,691,1
691,I won't keep it for myself but give it to someone.,691,1
692,very very cheap like a toy,692,1
693,The clip to hold the stockings is plastic and broke the first time I tried to wear them,693,1
694,I love this dress but when I put it on it didn't even cover my chest.,694,1
694,I will have to wear a tank top underneath.,694,1
694,I would love to send it back but it would cost more than what I bought the dress for.,694,1
695,"I sent this to my 27 yr old grandson he takes a XL shirt ..He said it very tight .He said way to small to even wear ..so disappointed
I would not buy this top..",695,1

698,"Will hold two pair of small framed glasses, but not a small pair and sunglasses which is what I wanted to us this for.",698,1
699,"Cute outfit, but mine had yellow stains all over it?",699,1
699,Not sure why that was all about.,699,1
700,"Plastic teeth with no ""bite"" so whenever my daughter moves, the belt slips off.",700,1
701,I hate the material.,701,1
701,The shirt fits but it's wayyyyyy to short and not the cute slouchy look as on the internet.,701,1
702,The costume fits fine.,702,1
702,"I wear size 6-8, and it works well.",702,1
702,"However, it took almost one month to get it, by then I had no use for it.",702,1
703,Have to agree with the other reviewer -not made for real women.,703,1
703,I ordered a 3XL based on the other reviewer and it was STILL too small (usually an XL).,703,1
704,Could MAYBE fit a doll.,704,1
704,Ridiculous sizing not even close to reality.,704,1
704,"I'm 5'4"" 140lbs.",704,1

704,It's almost funny how ridiculously small it is - if it wasn't such a waste of time and money.,704,1
704,Also the pattern looks NOTHING like what is shown in the picture.,704,1
705,Overpriced for quality of product.,705,1

713,A huge waste of more than a 170 dollars.,713,1
713,I was furious when I tried to return it and it was 3 days beyond the month allowed for returns.,713,1
713,"However,  when I called customer service to complain, the customer service rep was able to help me.",713,1
713,I was allowed to return it for a full refund.,713,1

716,The day they arrived I opened them and the diamonds had come out and they are all in the bottom of the bag.,716,1
717,"Really loved this bracelet but I received it and wore it maybe 2 days and then it broke, I have not tried to contact the seller because I have many things going on that are more important than getting a new bracelet but the seller was great to deal with minus the poor quality of their product.",717,1
718,Fit terribly.,718,1
719,The purses has a foul odor coming from the inside.,719,1

728,"I got a small and it was super baggy on me and I am by no means ""small"" lol.",728,1
728,I would honestly get a size small if I usually wear a Large as that's the only way I can image in fitting as snug as it's supposed to.,728,1
728,Also wrapped after first wear.,728,1
729,"There is no way, assuming standard human foot and leg dimensions, that these shirt stays can function as pictured.",729,1
729,They will protrude out from your shoes and make people think you're a strapped-up weirdo every time you sit.,729,1

730,Can't wear it.,730,1

735,I ordered extra large because it said it ran small.,735,1
735,It really runs small.,735,1
735,Even that is too snug to be comfortable.,735,1
735,I'm grateful I only spent $13.,735,1
735,It's now a Goodwill donation.,735,1

740,"Too thin, cheap material.",740,1

741,They don't work with any touch screen!,741,1
741,"I'm so disappointed - the finger tips look like they have the conducting threads, but not a single finger in either glove worked, and I tried them on three smart phones...",741,1
742,Not a fan.. Material was cheap.,742,1
742,"I'm 5'7"" 130 lbs and the medium was tight and too short.",742,1

743,"Very cute earing but they are too heavy on top, there's no support so they just fall even after you put them on as pictured.",743,1

747,This shirt looks nothing like the picture.,747,1
747,It is so ugly I literally gave it to the garbage to stop the spread of it.,747,1
748,It's a nice slim case that looks great on the phone.,748,1
748,However it is very smooth which is a problem when handling with one hand.,748,1
748,I use the holster clip daily for work related reasons.,748,1
748,On the first day the holster was getting caught on the plastic backing of the case.,748,1
748,"Twice I thought I locked the phone in the holster, only to have it fall out because the sound and click I felt wasn't from the holster locking.",748,1
748,It was from the holster grabbing the plastic backing.,748,1
748,Also the screen protector made it difficult to type quickly and created a reflection which obscured the images on the screen.,748,1
748,I do not recommend this case.,748,1
749,"Junk, not anything like the photo, elastic stretches way too much to look good as a hatband.",749,1
750,Fell apart with a couple washes.,750,1
751,"I know that this product is very cheap,  but I expected way more out of it then what I got.",751,1

759,Active Basic Camis-This is the third time Ive bought the Active Basic Camis w/Built-in Shelf Bra through Amazon.,759,1
759,The first time was a 2-pak through the one seller.,759,1
759,They were perfect so I ordered a 4-pak but the 4-pak was only available through a different seller.,759,1
759,I figured it would be a consistent match as they were titled the same Active Basic Long Camis in Large w/ Built-in Shelf Bra.,759,1
759,"Boy, was that a wrong assumption.",759,1
759,They weren't even Active Basic brand but the sellers own & they didn't have a shelf bra but two foam pads sewn in a sling that after one washing was a wadded up mess.,759,1
759,"So being a PollyAnna trooper I tried again, this time I made sure it was through the same first seller & I got a 2-pak exactly the same size & listing as the first time I bought them.",759,1
759,They fit great & all was well until my back began to hurt from a scratching chaff.,759,1
759,"Turns out on comparing these to the first ones I bought, these have the elastic straps sewn in backwards so the scratchy heavy duty thread that binds the straps to the halter in back along with the tacked down material rubs against the shoulder blades.",759,1
759,The first ones bought have the straps tacked down facing the halter away from the skin.,759,1
759,I don't know why consistency is a problem but I cant seem to get proper Active Basic Camis.,759,1
759,Im going to shop around for another brand & hope for a better product.,759,1
760,"This product was not as pictured and cheaply made, when I went to try it on and pulled it opened it ripped like paper.",760,1

767,"Can't complain too much because it was so inexpensive, but is not something I will ever wear!",767,1

779,Doesn't even deserve 2 stars,779,1
780,This might be a large... No way a 5xl.,780,1
781,I ordered the XXL expecting that it would run small.,781,1

917,Not really sure if I can leave accurate feedback.,917,1
917,I ordered a S was sent an XL.,917,1
917,I didn't notice until right before class and ended up wearing shorts that were huge on my during a hot yoga class.,917,1

919,!,919,1
920,I ordered a size bigger than what I usually wear and it was still too small.,920,1
921,Returning it because it will snap close with cards in the end slots.,921,1
921,Will not hold a full checkbook nor my cellphone a small Moto X...,921,1
921,I fear that after one or two snaps it will break and the zipper keeps catching the money.,921,1
922,I believe it was poorly made because when you tried to bend it either to your lip or to your area here it broke,922,1
923,Very inaccurate sizing.,923,1
924,I ordered a 2x and it was tiny!!!,924,1
924,It was tight on my daughter who is a size 10.,924,1

925,"The fabric was very thin, and although it is black you can see through it.",925,1

929,I just received my dress today..,929,1
929,I just requested a refund and I hope my request is granted.,929,1
929,This dress is very very see through and I think it's because the material is cheap.,929,1
929,It's so see through that you cannot wear panties or go pantyless..The colors don't match the picture.. Maybe because it's cheap fabric.,929,1
929,"The red is coral, the yellow is lime green etc...",929,1
929,I definitely would not buy this dress..,929,1
929,I wouldn't even wear it for free..,929,1

936,They looks good when you take them out of the package but that's where the good feelings end.,936,1
936,Ordered a medium for a guy that wears a 34 and the pants are ridiculously small.,936,1

941,The leather is very cheap and the buckle is very very cheap...,941,1
941,I used it one and the paint was coming of and the leather stretched so it fit loose after the first use.,941,1
941,The leather was very thin and made of small peace's of leather... just now a good product.,941,1
942,Terrible fit it has to be a girls size or junior it doesn't even fit my daughter is is a size 4.,942,1
943,Looks nothing like the picture cheap material and the cut  in the front isn't like the picture at all poorly stitched and the plastic breaks after the first wear,943,1

1051,Dresses that cost this much should be properly tailored (as shown in the photos) and not need to rely on trash techniques like smocking for fit.,1051,1
1051,"If the smocking had not been there, the dress would have fit beautifully instead of smashing my chest flat.",1051,1

1056,The bottom looks so cheap and put together in the quickest way possible.,1056,1
1056,The top feels and looks like a top made for a barbie doll.,1056,1

1068,"Was confusing to put on, and the ties in the front were not aligned.",1068,1
1069,Cheap quality,1069,1
1070,beautiful necklace....unfortunately it was delivered broken.,1070,1

1071,These gloves are very soft and have a vibrant color.,1071,1
1071,"That being said, the first time I wore them a little rain water got on them (I didn't think anything of it).",1071,1
1071,The water ended up leaving splotchy stains all over the gloves!!!,1071,1
1071,I have NEVER heard of water doing this to leather!!!,1071,1
1071,I am extremely disappointed and would never have ordered these gloves if I knew this could happen.,1071,1

1076,I had to really  work to pull the crotch panel up to my actual crotch.,1076,1
1076,Normally that wouldn't matter too much but the fabric difference made it look like I had 2 bean bags between my legs.,1076,1
1076,The waist is good.,1076,1
1077,I paid for the shoes and one of them doesn't even turn off when I opened it the shoe was on and now the battery is broken,1077,1

1079,"Was really disappointed that this bra wasn't very supportive and the straps appear to be sewn incorrectly, I couldn't untwist the strap.",1079,1
1079,I returned the item and was contacted multiple times by the company offering to exchange for another item and to remove my poor review (the emails were a little hard to understand since they were translated).,1079,1
1079,Although I wasn't satisfied with the product they do want a happy customer.,1079,1

1213,My wife bought this dress as quantity one but they sent us 2 pieces of the same size( charging $15 each) and none of them fit.,1213,1
1213,Very poor material.,1213,1
1214,Nothing like the photo.,1214,1
1214,"I ordered two sizes up expecting it run small since it's from China, but I got a tight plain white t shirt.",1214,1
1214,"Doesn't hang off the shoulders, isn't the same material as pictured.",1214,1
1214,Very disappointed.,1214,1
1215,Its was to large and the strings were hanging,1215,1
1216,Not happy with this at all.,1216,1
1216,No where did it say that this was from China and sizes would be different.,1216,1
1216,I bought a 12-18 month size for my 15 month old that will be 16 months in December.,1216,1
1216,And the shirt will have to be worn now as a dress bc this outfit is sooo big.,1216,1
1216,And the pants can't be worn by her for years.,1216,1
1216,So pissed.,1216,1
1216,"Doesn't even say 12-18 months, says size 90, whatever that is in China.",1216,1
1216,"And on top of all that, there's pieces of thread already trying to fall off and it was just now delivered.",1216,1
1216,Horrible buy!!!!,1216,1
1216,One of the pictures below show a pair of her current pants vs the these ones for the same months.,1216,1
1216,Rediculous.,1216,1
1217,Came apart after 2nd use.,1217,1
1218,To much money for such a cheaply made wallet,1218,1
1219,Very small,1219,1
1220,Waaaaaaaay too small.,1220,1
1220,Like shockingly small.,1220,1
1220,Like a bear wearing a onesie small.,1220,1
1221,Both zippers on the two main pockets broke within about a month.,1221,1
1221,I used it mainly to carry a few books and a sweater on my commute to and from work.,1221,1
1221,Went back to my North Face which costed about 30 bucks more but has lasted over 6 years travelling around the world.,1221,1
1222,They run a size small.,1222,1
1222,All my son's other shoes are Skechers and he wears a 1 and has room to grow.,1222,1
1222,He will probably grow out of the  Under Armour  within a month.,1222,1
1222,We have had them 3 weeks and he is already complaining they are too tight.,1222,1
1222,Sad because he absolutely loves them.,1222,1
1222,He is wearing them despite they fit snug.,1222,1
1222,They were $60.00 so I refuse to buy another pair.,1222,1
1223,The cut on this is ridiculous.,1223,1
1223,The slit goes up to my waist and the angle of the front of this dress is so steep that the front is more like a shirt than a dress and because of the way they cut it there is not enough fabric to sew it and reduce the slit.,1223,1
1223,Very disappointed.,1223,1
1224,"I can wear a median ,but I hit a large and it is still to small",1224,1
1225,Shipped from China.,1225,1
1225,Material bled even after washing.,1225,1
1225,Very cheaply made.,1225,1
1225,Neckline stretches out easily.,1225,1
1226,Cute top but too small!!,1226,1
1226,If you do order this top order 2-3 sizes bigger.,1226,1
1227,Something no one else explained: There is no way to order different sizes to make the perfect bikini out of these because the back isn't adjustable enough to make it work.,1227,1
1227,"In other words, the cups in the top are entirely too small if you order for the size around your rib cage and back, but if you order a larger size for larger cups it won't fit because the way it's made there is no way to make the adjustment in the back strap.",1227,1
1227,In any case no matter which size you buy you will have problems.,1227,1
1227,"I bought four different sizes and tried different size bottoms with different size tops to try and make one decent fitting bikini but no matter what I did, there was no way for it to work.",1227,1
1227,All of the bottoms are way too big and fit weird in front and all of the tops are made for flat chested girls that are big around the ribs and back.,1227,1
1227,Also there is no way to take out the hard cups that are built in which makes it impossible to look good over a chest that has actual boobs.,1227,1
1227,"I wasted my money on four swimsuits just to end up with nothing wearable, please don't make the same mistake.",1227,1
1227,These are made for big women with no boobs that wouldn't wear something so revealing... which is something I find odd because most asian clothes makers make everything too small HA!,1227,1
1228,"This is utility kilt number two for us...the first one was purchased in Scotland, lasted 22 years and was washed every week.",1228,1
1228,I have washed this one TWICE and will have to sew the belt loop back on.,1228,1
1228,"There is no washing instruction on the kilt so I washed it in cold water and hung it on the line......no excuses, it should have held up.",1228,1
1229,Material is made of poor satin.,1229,1
1229,It is not stretchy; not enough material to let out.,1229,1
1229,"There is elastic in waist line but too small for stretch to ensure ""one size fit all"" description.",1229,1
1229,Very small.,1229,1
1229,Arrived damp and smelly.,1229,1
1229,Returned.,1229,1
1230,Terrible quality and looks awful on.,1230,1
1230,I won't be wearing it.,1230,1
1231,"This fell apart after one wear,  and I use the word ""wear"" loosely .",1231,1
1231,It did not last a half hour.,1231,1
1231,Basically I put it on drove to work and it fell apart when I sat at my desk.,1231,1
1231,"Granted, this thing is cheap, so I'm out 2 bucks.",1231,1
1231,Just save yourself the 2 bucks and don't bother.,1231,1
1231,It only gets one star because you have to give it a rating otherwise it would get zero stars.,1231,1
1231,No stars for you.,1231,1
1232,horrible,1232,1
1233,"Purchased as a gift, was not happy with this shirt at all.",1233,1
1233,Looks super cheap.,1233,1
1233,I guess you get what you pay for.,1233,1
1233,Quality of the shirt was very thin and the graphics on the shirt are horrible.,1233,1
1233,This shirt looks like you wash it one time and it will fall apart in the washing machine.,1233,1
1233,Too embarrassed to give this as a gift.,1233,1
1234,Completely different material..,1234,1
1234,The bottom is way too large with a silk material.,1234,1
1234,Waste of money.,1234,1
1235,Great if you're a budding/aspiring gigo!,1235,1
1235,o,1235,1
1236,Looks super cheap.,1236,1
1236,Too cheap.,1236,1
1237,These did not fit me well so I returned them.,1237,1
1238,Cute shoes but the lights quit working about a week and a half after purchasing.,1238,1
1238,One shoe wouldn't charge.,1238,1
1238,The other had lights that would stay red.,1238,1
1238,My son loved them.,1238,1
1238,Just poor quality.,1238,1
1239,This product was the worst I've seen on this website.,1239,1
1239,"The screws were chipped, the blade was bent, and the side blades won't light up.",1239,1
1239,Don't waste your money on this product.,1239,1
1240,I am currently returning this item.,1240,1
1240,The hem line on the neckline was just unfinished and looked torn up.,1240,1
1240,It made it completely lost the elegance it would otherwise have.,1240,1
1240,"The fit was perfect, everything else about it was perfect, but that neckline was a no-go.",1240,1
1240,100% unacceptable.,1240,1
1240,It really looked that bad.,1240,1
1240,The lace was just unfinished/torn looking along the entire neck.,1240,1
1241,"the ""gemstones"" if you could even call it that, are cheap.",1241,1
1241,"ya get for the price what do you really expect, but as previous reviews mentioned, not quite as advertised.",1241,1
1241,i wouldn't even say its decent fashion/costume jewelry.,1241,1
1241,very disappointed.,1241,1
1242,Not a feminine ring!,1242,1
1242,My boyfriend loves his but I can't even wear mine!,1242,1
1242,Too thick & bulky!,1242,1
1242,Disappointed.,1242,1
1243,This shirt looks nothing like the picture.,1243,1
1243,"It is not a t-shirt, cotton material.",1243,1
1243,It is more of a dry fit material.,1243,1
1244,Huge pants button hole not open not high waisted seller trying to give partial refund us size small..i am 5 6 and 180 too big for me even,1244,1
1245,I ordered two Salt Life decals and neither worked.,1245,1
1245,The Decal did not stay on the  clear cellophane as it should but part staye on the the paper and part on the cellophane.,1245,1
1245,It was total mess and neither was usable.,1245,1
1245,It may be that they were old or something but I have never had this problem with these kind of decals before.,1245,1
1245,Totally unusuable product and I just wasted $30 plus shipping.,1245,1
1246,I am a size 2/4  and after reading other people's reviews I ordered a large.,1246,1
1246,Needless to say I got it on my body...but it looked RIDICULOUS!,1246,1
1246,THE sleeves were WAY to short.,1246,1
1246,The length of the shirt itself was too short as well.,1246,1
1246,My 3 year old asked why I was wearing a shirt in her size.,1246,1
1246,Don't waste your time or money on this!,1246,1
1247,I am very unhappy with this product.,1247,1
1247,It's tights and not capris.,1247,1
1247,You cannot wear this in public with just a shirt as it is made of nylons material and not fabric that would normally be used in leggings.,1247,1
1248,Much smaller then picture.,1248,1
1248,Just gray light weight jersey like material.,1248,1
1248,A waste of money.,1248,1
1249,"I have a size 34 waist, and I ordered the largest size possible.",1249,1
1249,These briefs fit well around the waist and butt.,1249,1
1249,The bad thing about these briefs is there's absolutely no room in the front.,1249,1
1249,It was so tight in the front and so uncomfortable.,1249,1
1249,After a while of wearing them my testicles started to ache.,1249,1
1249,These briefs would better suit a female  due to the lack of room for male genitalia.,1249,1
1250,Broke the first time I wore it.,1250,1
1251,I am very unhappy with this product.,1251,1
1251,It's tights and not capris.,1251,1

1252,I ordered large and it was so small I couldn't get it over my arms.,1252,1
1252,Had to give away to a child!,1252,1
1253,The print is pretty but the material is horrible.,1253,1
1253,Its like wearing a dollar store plastic table cloth.,1253,1
1254,Nothing like the picture and too small unfortunately..,1254,1
1254,Please save your money ladies!,1254,1
1255,"The price is good (better than most for mostly cotton socks) the socks run small they advertise 9-12 I'm an 11 and these are very tight, I can get them on but higher quality socks are much easier and stretch better.",1255,1
1255,These look nice but they are very thin and I ruined one pair just trying to pull the thread out that attached them to the paper label.,1255,1
1255,"I keep looking for a way to get nice quality dress socks for under $2 a pair but I'm coming to the conclusion I think you need to pay at least $3 a pair to get good ones maybe more...

***UPDATE*** I've now tried about 10 pair of these thrown 4 out (you would need to be a size 9 or smaller, then the 1st few I washed are all pilling after 1 wash (on dedicates) I'm going to throw all 24 out and start over.",1255,1
1255,"UGH the epitome of you get what you paid for dropping rating to 1 star, this is junk avoid if possible, don't let the pictures and materials fool you.",1255,1
1256,Turned green and the diamonds fell out :(,1256,1

1258,The tunic fit & style was not anything like the photo.,1258,1
1258,"Sleeves too short, resembles maternity top with wide bodice.",1258,1
1258,Very disappointed.,1258,1
1259,Don't buy this product.,1259,1
1259,The earring does not fit the ear as described in this photo.,1259,1

1259,"There is no other use for it, so don't buy it!!",1259,1
1259,!,1259,1
1260,Too small,1260,1
1261,"I really wanted to love this purse, here is why:  It's lightweight, comfortable, has great pockets and tons of room.",1261,1
1261,HOWEVER this product came either sprayed or sewn with some extremely TOXIC materials.,1261,1
1261,I really wanted to keep it despite my intuition warning me to not touch it.,1261,1
1261,I decided to try and air it out.,1261,1
1261,I waited 2 days.,1261,1
1261,"The smell diminished about 70%, but was still present.",1261,1
1261,I decided to try it anyway thinking it would go away eventually.,1261,1
1261,I immediately started itching anywhere the purse touched me and where the strap touched my neck there was a BURNING sensation!,1261,1
1261,"Buyer beware if you decide to order despite reviews of a bad smell, DO NOT KEEP it if it has a pungent smell, it won't go away and it most likely will be detrimental to your health.",1261,1
1262,The XXL was more like a Medium.,1262,1
1262,"Disappointed, but this is going back",1262,1
1263,Disappointed was damaged on arrival,1263,1
1264,Ripped on the first day.,1264,1

1264,The shipping took forever .,1264,1
1265,Broke the first time I put them on.,1265,1

1272,They do.,1272,1
1272,You can see below after just 30 minutes of wearing my daughters already starting to get quite a little blister.,1272,1

1278,It is a man's fit and not a women's fit.,1278,1
1278,I do not recommend this shirt for any mom!,1278,1
1279,The plastic on the watch where the pen to go through the band attaches broke as my daughter put it on.,1279,1
1280,"the material that was used is ugly and looks poorly made, the pink was excellent, I don't know what happened w/ the blue",1280,1
1281,"tooooooooooo small, and does not come with any type of instructions on how exactly to put this thing on!",1281,1
1281,very sexy tho!,1281,1
1282,"I ordered an XL, the tag said XL, but the actual product was a Medium.",1282,1
1282,"I am usually a L-XL in most clothing and I could barely pull this over my chest, it was skin tight.",1282,1
1283,I would give it no stars if I could.,1283,1
1283,Looks nothing like the picture posted and it is cheap satin material.,1283,1
1283,Took a very long time to arrive and then when I said I wanted to return with a very detailed description I was asked for a description and pictures.,1283,1
1283,They know they false advertised these so they should streamline the return process at the very least.,1283,1
1283,This needs to be v removed or represented accurately.,1283,1
1284,The socks fit my feet but hurt my toes.,1284,1

1285,Product received not identical to photo,1285,1
1286,"Will return, and I will never buy Breckelle's shoes again.",1286,1

1289,It barely covers my belly button and fits like a medium.,1289,1
1289,I tried to return it but I didn't hear back for a few days.,1289,1
1289,Then they wanted me to send pictures.,1289,1
1289,Ugh too much work.,1289,1
1289,"By then, my tiny 5 foot tall wife tried it on and it fits her perfect.",1289,1
1289,"Seriously, don't waste your money it's way too small.",1289,1
1290,I ordered on the larger size and they fit fine in the waist but the rest is uncomfortable.,1290,1
1290,They somehow manage to be too big and too small at the same time.,1290,1
1290,You can only see the design when they are stretched tightly.,1290,1
1291,It fits to small .,1291,1
1292,"This isn't a ""crop"" top, it's a full on under the breast, half shirt, it's like a bra-with sleeves.",1292,1
1292,The sleeves are a hideous mesh and the sewing was terrible..spare yourself and don't waste the $7 on this top.,1292,1
1292,It's not even wearable nor cute.,1292,1
1293,Short and bright white not the color in the pic,1293,1
1294,"These pants are for a stick baby, they have a tiny waist and are really long.",1294,1
1294,And then the shirt is tiny.,1294,1
1295,Was not at all what I ordered don't be fooled the beads were plastic and looked poorly made,1295,1
1296,Was the worst thing I've ever bought!,1296,1

1303,"Have spayed everything I could find, aired outside, inside, inside out.",1303,1
1303,This purse smells so disgusting I can't even bring it in the house STILL.,1303,1
1303,Do you let rats die in your bags before you ship them??,1303,1
1303,Everybody that has come over here has smelled this thing standing feet away from it.,1303,1
1303,OMG.,1303,1

1307,"very cheap looking, didn't use it, got something else",1307,1
1308,The sizing on this product is awful!,1308,1
1308,I normally wear a US size 12/14 but thought I would go bigger on the cover up so I ordered an XL which said fit US size 16/18.,1308,1
1308,HA!,1308,1
1308,"The XL is so tight I can barely get it over my hops and it hugs my curves, unlike the picture which implies a lot of fluidity.",1308,1
1309,Bought a med bc people said it runs small.,1309,1
1309,I am a size 2 and the med is huge.,1309,1

1310,"The waist elastic does not fit in the waist band, it is WAY too small and thin for the size of the waist.",1310,1
1310,No way it could fold over like it is supposed to.,1310,1
1310,The waist is also sewn so poorly it BUNCHES.,1310,1
1310,I could not even try these on.,1310,1
1310,They are the cheapest most poor quality I have ever seen from Amazon.,1310,1
1310,Unreal...  and from China.,1310,1
1310,These are not advertised as coming from China either.,1310,1
1310,Just awful.,1310,1
1311,these heans are the worst jeans i have ever bought they where way too small because the size chart is off.,1311,1

1313,I bought large and was still small to wrap around.,1313,1
1313,So I have to donate :-(,1313,1
1314,"Terrible quality, this shirt was spandex not the waxed cotton cloth dashikis are typically made from.",1314,1
1314,Great price for an inferior product.,1314,1
1315,The first one I ordered had a broken watch band.,1315,1

1317,I gave it 1 star because I can still use the bag for myl lunch,1317,1
1318,The devil is a liar with the length and cut on this wrap.,1318,1
1319,Returned .,1319,1
1319,Cheaply made & material,1319,1
1320,This is not made for a plus size women it looks like a ex small so I wasted my gift card on two items purchased and both of them ran very very small.,1320,1
1320,Iam very disappointed with my two purchases,1320,1
1321,I bought an XL and it was to small in the bust and length.,1321,1
1321,So I bought a 3XL and it fit the same as XL.,1321,1
1321,Very disappointed,1321,1
1322,I ordered the black hat with white print.,1322,1
1322,NOT what I got.,1322,1
1322,"Hat is black, the printing on it is light grey.",1322,1
1322,"The hat ""feels"" cheap.",1322,1
1322,As the saying goes ... you get what you pay for.,1322,1
1322,Funny thing is I ordered a $7 Trump hat for my husband and it is not only embroidered but is made with high quality materials.,1322,1
1322,I suggest you keep looking and pass on this one.,1322,1
1323,These earrings were beautiful but the way they were crafted was ridiculous.,1323,1
1323,They stuck out from the ear and looked awkward and heavy.,1323,1
1323,The thickness made them to heavy to fit against the ear and they were very just did not fit properly.,1323,1
1323,Did anyone try them on to check for this problem?,1323,1
1324,The quality is so bad.,1324,1
1324,I use the watch almost 2 month.the gear wheel let loose.,1324,1
1324,The watch didn't work.,1324,1
1324,Do not waste money to buy this watch.,1324,1
1325,Too small,1325,1
1326,Sent it back.,1326,1
1327,I also ordered an XXL and it fit me like a medium.,1327,1
1327,And there is no Lacoste label sewn anywhere on this shirt.,1327,1
1327,Not even washing instructions.,1327,1
1327,It's like a bulk production of an inferior product and they decided to put the Lacoste name to make it more appealing (the brand doesn't matter to me - just the style).,1327,1
1327,Returned.,1327,1
1328,"Way too short, I sent it back",1328,1
1329,"This phone case came a month late, and it's not even a selfie lighting case.",1329,1
1329,It's a phone case with a sticker on the back that makes it look like one.,1329,1
1329,No lights on it at all.,1329,1
1329,Very upset and confused.,1329,1
1330,"If you have used the original sock as pictured without the seam at the top, then BE WARNED this is not the sock you will be getting.",1330,1
1330,I tried 2 times and instead received a revised version of the sock.,1330,1
1330,I called Incrediwear.,1330,1
1330,"I was told ""It's exactly the same sock....except the fiber content is different....and the design changed...and it's new packaging"" Well then how the heck is it the same sock?!?!",1330,1
1330,"This is what the new packaging shows as the fiber content:
Grey Ankle
36% Cotton (Germanium Infused)
34% Polyester (Carbon Infused)
26% Nylon (Germanium Infused)
4% Spandex

The old Packaging lists as the content:
germanium+bamboo charcoal fiber 78%, flexible fiber 22%

The original sock is 100 times softer than this new version.",1330,1
1330,"The old version comes in a grey card sleeve, the new version is packaged in an orange box.",1330,1
1330,"So if you've never seen or worn these socks, then you will not know any better.",1330,1
1330,"But if you are looking for the original like I was, THESE ARE NOT IT.",1330,1
1330,"I contacted the seller and since the company kept the same UPC, I was going to be charged a 15% restocking fee, which the company finally waived, but I will have to pay for return shipping.",1330,1
1330,The company referred me to the Legal Disclaimer: Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.,1330,1
1330,"We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.",1330,1
1330,"As the product was changed by the makers of Incredisock with slightly altered materials however keeping the same design and UPC, the product is still being sold under the Incrediwear name and as the Diabetic sock.",1330,1
1330,"And there is my point and my warning to you<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredisocks-Rx-Diabetic-Socks-Crew-Grey-1-Unit/dp/B0055QNJBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredisocks Rx Diabetic Socks Crew Grey 1 Unit</a>....the design is not the same.....",1330,1
1331,Unfortunately it was way too small.,1331,1
1331,The dress was extremely cute and reasonable.,1331,1
1331,I got it two sizes bigger than normal because the other reviews said that it was small and I still couldn't get it on.,1331,1
1331,Not happy at all.,1331,1
1332,Waaay to small,1332,1
1333,"This shirt just came today, actually before the estimated delivery time!",1333,1
1333,I was really excited until I took it out of the bag.,1333,1
1333,"The fabric is stretchy, soft and comfortable, but not the way the fabric looks in the photo.",1333,1
1333,I ordered an x-large to be safe (I'm large in the cheSt area).,1333,1
1333,"Could have gotten away with a large,  but I like a looser fit.",1333,1
1333,The problem is the length.,1333,1
1333,Not at all what the photo portrays.,1333,1
1333,This is basically a belly shirt for me.,1333,1
1333,Very disappointed there.,1333,1
1333,"The photo makes it look like it's a little long in the front and back, coming up a little on the sides.",1333,1
1333,My shirt was not made that way!,1333,1
1333,Lol.,1333,1

1334,I don't like it,1334,1
1335,Gave to friends 12 year old daughter,1335,1
1336,I ordered the Large and it was way too big for me in the bust.,1336,1

1337,The clasp is not secure at all and would like my money back.,1337,1
1338,The worst choker ever!,1338,1
1338,Mine wasn't even on the clasp evenly.,1338,1
1338,One part of the necklace was bigger than the other.,1338,1
1338,The quality is so cheap!,1338,1

1339,Shipping very bad.,1339,1
1339,It was break my bag.,1339,1

1341,Fell apart within 15 min and fabric is very delicate fell apart and chains broke,1341,1
1342,"loved the soft material but very poor stiching, my daughter wore to an hour long math class the first day we got it and the bottom stiching  was off by the time she was came out of the classroom.",1342,1
1342,Will not buy again.,1342,1
1343,Too small,1343,1

1344,It;s not a sheath - its a miniskirt.,1344,1
1344,"Dealing with the returns was a nightmare - they kept giving me the runaround then finally ""approved"" by return by telling me I could pay to ship it back to China myself.",1344,1
1344,i guess I'll just use it as a cleaning rag.,1344,1
1345,Dress is too thin.,1345,1
1346,I bought this for my son.,1346,1

1378,It is more plastic than I like and smaller than it looks.,1378,1
1378,The handle is barely there so you must use the over the shoulder strap.,1378,1

1525,Very cheap material as well.,1525,1
1525,I will be returning.,1525,1
1526,"I read the reviews and someone stated they are a size 14 and this fit perfectly, so I ordered it.",1526,1
1526,"I am not a size 14 but like my tops to be loose, this is so small, it was even tight on my arms.",1526,1
1527,Cheap!,1527,1
1527,But I guess you get what you pay for,1527,1

1531,Very Cheap looking not the same as the picture.,1531,1

1532,All at a lesser cost & they were a much better quality  of what I received.,1532,1
1532,Not a very acurate description.,1532,1
1533,"Awful product, will not be happy until I receive a medium shirt at no charge.",1533,1
1533,Until then I will keep my negative review.,1533,1
1533,"Knock off, FAKE!",1533,1
1534,"Way too small, decided it was way too much hassle to exchange it.",1534,1
1534,Took the loss!,1534,1
1534,!,1534,1
1535,"As per comments, I ordered one size larger - XXL.",1535,1
1535,It wouldn't fit my friend who wears a size 10-12!,1535,1
1535,"Needless to say, I couldn't get it on one leg!",1535,1
1536,"Don't waste your money, completely different dress than the one here.",1536,1
1537,"I cant recommend this item, I ordered a large and WOW folks it was way to small, I am a US size 6 cost to much to return, so I am stuck with a product I will never wear, the sizing is so way way off.",1537,1
1537,Enough said.,1537,1
1538,This garment is a joke.,1538,1
1538,It's called a muscle tee but is just a t-shirt with the sleeves haphazardly cut off.,1538,1
1538,The silk screening is terrible.,1538,1
1538,It's a bummer.,1538,1
1538,It's completely unwearable and couldn't possibly look or feel cheaper.,1538,1
1539,I was extremely disappointed in this item and the communication with the seller.,1539,1
1539,I requested my money back and they did not respond.,1539,1
1539,The item runs very small is extremely poor quality the bottom of the dress isn't even hemmed.,1539,1
1539,They surged the bottom and left it completely unfinished.,1539,1
1539,"It's very sheer, much more suited to be a nightgown.",1539,1
1539,I would not recommend this item or seller.,1539,1
1539,Take your money elsewhere.,1539,1
1540,Did not arrive as pictured.,1540,1
1540,Came so tangled that I till haven't untangled it fully.,1540,1
1541,Cheap looking and several stone were missing,1541,1
1542,Very cheap material...like lingerie.,1542,1
1542,...like 3 sizes too small.,1542,1
1542,"They allowed a return...to China  for mail fee of $13, when it was only  $20.",1542,1
1543,Purchased size XL and ended up giving them to my 12 year old.,1543,1
1543,Teeny-tiny.,1543,1
1544,"Does not work, even with brand new 2nd battery that was provided.",1544,1
1545,So disappointed!,1545,1
1545,The dress is see thru!,1545,1
1545,Guess you get what you pay for.,1545,1
1546,The dress fits well but poorly made.,1546,1
1546,The buttons don't line up.,1546,1
1546,Fabric quality is decent but you can see that the fake buttons don't line up miles away.,1546,1
1547,When offering a broad range of colors (18 choices to be exact)  you should either a. supply the choice(s) purchased or b. make it so whoever is packing the box knows which color is which.,1547,1
1547,"Now, I ordered the burgundy set- which, in the picture, looks burgundy.",1547,1
1547,"So I thought, perfect.",1547,1
1547,"When it comes, my set is RED.",1547,1
1547,Almost stop light red.,1547,1
1547,So either someone messed up in the warehouse or they are misrepresenting their products.,1547,1
1547,"Beyond that, the set seemed decent enough for the price, not especially high quality but good enough to get as a one off when trying to match a wedding date.",1547,1
1547,Would I order again?,1547,1
1547,"Maybe... if I was looking for a ""regular"" color (blue, green, red as opposed to navy, olive, burgundy).",1547,1
1548,"Purchased mint, product color not as shown.",1548,1
1548,"Turned out to be a dark, pavonine green... Nice color, but not what I had wanted.",1548,1
1548,Disappointed.,1548,1
1549,This broke after one day!!!,1549,1
1549,!,1549,1
1550,Material is thin it ripped as I was trying it on,1550,1
1551,Don't buy!,1551,1
1551,The case worked for about three days and then the button completely fell out and it doesn't work.,1551,1
1551,Unfortunately I wasted my money on two of these cases and gave one as a gift.,1551,1
1552,i returned it.,1552,1
1552,the bras is not usable.,1552,1
1552,the bikini is huuuge and the bras minuscule!!!,1552,1
1552,how can they sell something that poorly made?,1552,1
1552,?,1552,1
1553,They should come in sizes...they are way too large for my 9 year old,1553,1
1554,It was too small and your stuff should be made in bigger sizes for bigger bodied women not everybody is the size of a freakin toothpick,1554,1
1555,They broke when I took off the back to put on.. You get what you pay for I guess..,1555,1
1556,This item was too small and I ordered the largest size possible.,1556,1
1556,The material as cheap as well.,1556,1
1556,I ended up giving it to my mom and she will put it in a box to send to her poor relatives in the Philippines.,1556,1
1556,Sorry...,1556,1
1557,Just no,1557,1
1558,"The word ""bright"" was misspelled ""bribht"".",1558,1
1558,I returned it and was charged a $6 return fee for a defective product!!,1558,1
1558,I ordered 5 pairs for our grandchildren and only one was misspelled.,1558,1
1558,Now I have one grandchild who will not have matching pj's Christmas morning.,1558,1
1559,I  bought this as a present and thinking that since it was made of leather that it would be a better quality product...WRONG!!!!,1559,1
1559,The person I bought this for initially loved it but the thing immediately started falling apart.,1559,1
1559,The tassels kept falling off and the zippers broke within the two weeks that she had it.,1559,1
1559,"It doesn't matter that you bought the present early, Amazon only covers returns for the first 30 days and since it is an online business, you don't get to talk to anybody about it, just a ""sorry about your luck"" message.",1559,1
1559,"No Manager, No alternatives such as exchange offered....NOTHING.",1559,1
1559,"It doesn't matter that they obviously sell crappy merchandise, or that you have made hundreds of orders on Amazon.com.",1559,1
1559,It's just your tough luck!,1559,1
1559,Yay for online purchases....for the seller anyways.,1559,1
1560,They are a terrible quality.,1560,1
1560,So thin that toes ripped holes in them on their first wear.,1560,1
1560,I would not purchase this product again.,1560,1
1561,Runs small,1561,1
1562,Way too small and very cheap quality,1562,1
1563,Material is cheap and size runs small,1563,1
1564,"I received my order and was very disappointed, the quality wasn't good at all, and I got it two sizes up and it still didn't fit,  it was to short and I'm not even tall.",1564,1
1564,"The jumpsuit looks like someone grab piece of cloth to make it, there's no label inside, please refund my money back.",1564,1
1565,This dress was misized about two sizes.,1565,1
1565,Ordered a 6 it was about a 3.,1565,1
1565,Would not recommend.,1565,1
1566,Not please at all too small and hard to zip up kept getting stuck.,1566,1
1567,I would not order again.,1567,1
1567,I got the wrong size and the wrong color.,1567,1
1567,Very disappointed!!,1567,1
1567,!,1567,1
1568,The dress is sheer!,1568,1
1568,thats all i can say,1568,1
1569,"Worst Amazon purchase ever......too baggy in the bust line, awful material, and would look just as bad on Giselle Bundchen!",1569,1
1569,Spend the money to get a real dress not this imitation yikes!,1569,1
1570,These boxes are not as described in the product dimensions section which have them listed as 6 x 5 x 1.4 inches.,1570,1
1570,They are much smaller and are in fact 3 X 2 inches.,1570,1
1570,The photo is also wrong and misleading in an attempt to make you think the boxes are much bigger than what they actually are.,1570,1
1570,Stop trying to be slick and put the true dimensions in U.S.,1570,1
1570,INCHES for both product description and product dimensions and the correct photo.,1570,1
1570,Total waste of time ordering these boxes and having to return them.,1570,1
1571,So unhappy!!!,1571,1
1571,This is awful.,1571,1
1571,"But fast delivery, I have to give them that!",1571,1
1572,These glasses were no good!,1572,1
1572,They were so distorted I couldn't use them!,1572,1
1572,Wasted my money- wrote a negative review and have NOT heard back from them!,1572,1
1573,"Horrible quality, doesn't fit as expected or discription.",1573,1
1573,Ordered up 2 sizes snd still doesn't fit.,1573,1
1573,Scratchy material.,1573,1

1574,These are NOT 18 gauge.,1574,1
1574,They HURT!,1574,1
1574,I've only ever had piercing earrings (which are supposedly 20-18g).,1574,1
1574,It was a fight to get these things in.,1574,1
1574,"And even hours later, they are not at all comfortable.",1574,1
1574,"The length of the stud is sufficient, and I like that it's a screw-on ball, but if you're not used to 16 or 14 gauge, be prepared for a TIGHT fit.",1574,1
1575,"The photo is different to what I received, huge brazalet, the yellow ball is huge and doesnt looks as nice as pictured",1575,1
1576,The darker tungsten around makes the golden colour look more flashy... And makes it look fake one..,1576,1
1576,But great to fit and good for price,1576,1
1577,Sizing off and zipper was broken.,1577,1

1582,Very very small like paper matterial,1582,1
1583,Bought these because of the stellar reviews and had high hopes for sore feet relief.,1583,1

1583,I gave them an extra couple of days in case they needed to break in--to no avail.,1583,1
1584,This necklace is so gross.,1584,1
1584,I don't care if it is cheap.,1584,1

1589,"I'm an average sized Asian, and I thought this would fit, but it doesn't at all.",1589,1

1590,Not impressed at all!,1590,1
1590,I finally receive it and the hoodie is not thick as it look in the picture.,1590,1
1590,It does not have a string that goes through the hood.,1590,1
1590,The logo is faded looking and just doesn't look like the actual North Face logo.,1590,1
1590,The stitching of the pocket is not finished correctly.,1590,1
1590,Not happy at all with it.,1590,1
1591,This product looks nothing like the picture itself.,1591,1
1591,"It is made of very cheap material, something u would purchase at a dollar store.",1591,1
1591,The quality was horrible!,1591,1
1591,The worst I've ever seen.,1591,1
1591,"I was blown away by this person trying to sell it for what they did, $30 bucks wasted!",1591,1

1612,I received it with stones missing!,1612,1

1613,Stinks.,1613,1
1613,So sorry to have bought it and would like to warn all other interested buyers.,1613,1
1614,Wow!,1614,1
1614,"SO cute in the pic and description seemed accurate (one never really knows), BUT I have tried them on twice while getting ready for my work out at the gym, and they have an odd fit; the waist band in the rear will not come up to my waist as the front part does.",1614,1
1614,Not a good sign.,1614,1
1614,"I am 5'4, 145 lbs and toned - not overweight.",1614,1

1617,"Within two hours, it had folded over and scrunched up and would not go back to its proper position.",1617,1
1617,I also got the kourtney kardashian version which worked out a little better.,1617,1
1617,This version is not good for people with long torsos either.,1617,1
1617,The kk model later about 2 weeks of 24/7 wear before it just folded too much.,1617,1
1617,I looked slim in this while wearing it and almost bought into it too.,1617,1
1617,"Six weeks of round the clock wearing a belly bandit girdle and at 7 weeks, the pooch is right back where it was.",1617,1
1617,These products are a hoax.,1617,1
1618,The shirt was too small,1618,1
1619,Terrible.,1619,1
1619,Poor quality.,1619,1
1619,Will never purchase from this seller again.,1619,1
1620,The size online didn't match my size,1620,1
1621,I should have looked more closely at the photo.,1621,1
1621,This item only worked with skinny straps.,1621,1
1622,Holes too small to fit a pandora bracelet or even a regular bracelet,1622,1
1623,The sizing is a joke.,1623,1
1623,Made for ridiculously x-small to small frames.,1623,1
1624,"This is not a dress, at most, this could be used as a sleeping gow because it is see-through.",1624,1
1624,I am disappointed I wasted my money on this item.,1624,1
1625,disappointed.,1625,1
1625,very cheap design and way to large.,1625,1
1625,not recommended.,1625,1
1626,There is absolutely no space to add ashes!,1626,1
1626,"I thought there might be some pieces that were to large, after ""fixing"" that I still could not get them in.",1626,1
1626,There is no space for them!,1626,1
1626,"There is enough room for the screw cap, but nowhere for ashes to go into the necklace!",1626,1
1626,"I just now got up to feeling like doing this, what a disappointment!",1626,1
1627,"Since the description said ""runs small"" I ordered a size above my usual size.",1627,1
1627,It is still too small!,1627,1
1627,I'll not be ordering from them again.,1627,1
1627,This company really needs to get sizing figured out.,1627,1
1627,"Very unhappy, the shirt is beautiful but useless.",1627,1
1628,"Would NOT get this again, it's not surgical steel.",1628,1
1628,I had it in for less than a week and I noticed my nose started hurting.,1628,1
1628,"I instantly had to take it out and put my retainer ring back in due to an infection since the product is ""Plated"" the plating started coming odd revealing it was not even painted very well, it's copper and fake surgical steel.",1628,1
1628,NOT worth the money,1628,1
1629,shirts are way too big for the size,1629,1
1630,They're so small.,1630,1
1630,Like come on,1630,1
1631,"The top of this is at most a b cup, the model shown would not fit into it and neither do I.",1631,1
1631,The cup part digs unflattering lines if you are bigger not allowing the bows to rest where they should and instead popping off to the side.,1631,1
1631,It is really long so the strings over the torso sagged.,1631,1
1631,The bottom part is not made like underwear but more of an unstretching front panel with a tight string running front to back and unwearable for any amount of time.,1631,1
1631,"This may fit someone who is 5'8+, a size 2 with very small hips, and a 32b or smaller.",1631,1
1631,"I am 5'6, size 7, 34g and tried to adjust by cutting some strings but to no avail.",1631,1
1631,Threw it out without contacting seller.,1631,1
1631,My loss.,1631,1

1741,You must be flat chested to wear this.,1741,1
1742,This shirt was made way small,1742,1
1743,Very poor quality for the price.,1743,1
1743,I returned them.,1743,1
1744,I bought this thinking it was made from faux leather and it clearly says genuine leather.,1744,1
1744,I did not want a leather belt as I am anti leather.,1744,1
1744,Unfortunately I cannot return it and I am now stuck with a strip of dead animal.,1744,1
1744,Perhaps they change the description to leather.,1744,1
1745,Didn't hold up well.,1745,1
1746,Isn't as flowy as it looks in the picture... sleeves makes it look like you have football pads on.,1746,1
1747,"At first I thought this was rather nice, however it is extremely hard to get your cards out when you are standing at a cash register, and the cashier is looking at you like you are an idiot.",1747,1
1747,End up having to take all 10 cards out just to get the one I want.,1747,1
1747,"Also, the rubber band broke within 3 weeks.",1747,1
1747,Would not recommend.,1747,1
1747,Step this.,1747,1
1747,Try another one.,1747,1
1748,unimpressed allaround,1748,1
1749,"Much too small, would not even meet to close.",1749,1
1749,"Very disappointed, because it's a beautiful robe.",1749,1
1750,did not get the necklace,1750,1
1751,"Cheaply printed plastic feeling design, i'll be sending this garbage back - also false customs declaration of value of goods, screenshot of goods and photo of packaging will be forwarded to customs.",1751,1
1752,I have normal head but this is way too small.,1752,1
1752,VERY disappointing.,1752,1
1753,DO NOT BUY.,1753,1
1753,It is made of such a cheap material and the seams look like a child tried to sew them.,1753,1
1753,Not worth the two week wait.,1753,1
1754,I really don't like this bag so much it is difficult to put items into the bag because of the small zipper at the top.,1754,1
1754,I had a bag similar to this and it was much better than this.,1754,1
1755,These were not sized accurately and ripped in the inseam as soon as my son sat down in them.,1755,1
1756,It comes from China and takes forever to get here.,1756,1
1756,The xxl size was a small at best.,1756,1
1757,"This is terrible, I don't like!",1757,1
1758,Okay so I bought this for my wedding.,1758,1
1758,I was disappointed to open it just to see that this thing had loose pearls rolling around in the bag that were suppose to be attached.,1758,1
1758,It also doesn't look like it can bend around the head without it breaking.,1758,1
1759,This dress is horrible it didn't fit at all it was cheaper for me to sell it to someone who likes to look tight in their clothes.,1759,1
1759,I look at the size chart and I and a size medium I ordered a size large.,1759,1
1760,It's broke n half,1760,1
1761,I loved this shirt!,1761,1
1761,"It was super comfy, but I literally got to wear it one time.",1761,1
1761,"I washed it one time according to the instructions, and air dryed, and it still shrunk so small I couldn't wear it again!",1761,1
1761,I've never seen a shirt shrink like this!!,1761,1
1761,Definitely would recommend a size or two up just so u can wash the damn thing!,1761,1
1762,"I have no idea what this thing is made of, but whatever cheap material from china it is it makes my allergies horrible.",1762,1
1762,stay away from it if you have allergies.,1762,1
1763,This was ordered as a possible Halloween costume for my daughter.,1763,1
1763,This could fit her plus the rest of the track team!,1763,1
1763,The photos are misleading.,1763,1
1764,I don't like.,1764,1
1764,Is very simple.,1764,1
1764,Diferent Than the photo,1764,1
1765,Does not work.,1765,1
1765,Used it on my ID scanner at work and the scanner was able to read my ID card.,1765,1
1766,"Dislike fits like a big trash bag, baggy not form fitting at all",1766,1
1767,Save your money!,1767,1
1767,Doesn't fit!,1767,1
1767,You'd have to be 5 yrs old,1767,1
1768,I ordered this item for my son's Christmas band concert.,1768,1
1768,He picked it out due to the tie looking like a candy cane.,1768,1
1768,What we got was a tie that was black and blue.,1768,1
1768,The shirt is also thin and see through.,1768,1
1768,"The tie isn't a full tie either, it's a rubber band with a tie attached.",1768,1
1768,"You get what you pay for, for sure!",1768,1
1768,This is cheap for a reason.,1768,1
1769,The shirt print looks NOTHING like the picture!,1769,1
1769,I wouldn't recommend buying this,1769,1
1770,Not accurate sizing,1770,1
1771,Did not like the way it hung too much like wearing a T-shirt.,1771,1
1771,Not flattering because it felt and looked like a smock that rode up while walking.,1771,1
1771,Returning this item.,1771,1
1772,This dress is described as a cotton blend itsit's made out of sleeping bag material.,1772,1
1772,No give at all.,1772,1
1773,"it is shinny fabric, ultra small, for a XS petit size.. no one can have this shoulder size... at the picture looks like a cotton fabric, but it is translucent and shinny... i hated.",1773,1
1773,"when i bought it was 10.33us, now it is even cheaper... and to return it they say i have to pay more then the price of the blouse.. don't waist your 10us.. better to save and buy some real one.",1773,1
1774,The top is ridiculous.,1774,1
1774,"You would have to be an ""A"" cup for it to fit.",1774,1
1775,Ripped right down the butt crack within 3 hours of wearing them.,1775,1
1776,The black shirt doesn't fit and the bluish purple one is kinda small.,1776,1
1777,Awful,1777,1
1778,Clasp broke before I could even put it on the first time.,1778,1
1778,And all the other negative reviews are true.,1778,1
1778,Going in donation pile.,1778,1
1779,The size is not what I wanted,1779,1
1780,The visor is extremely long.,1780,1
1780,Cheap and replica material,1780,1
1781,This will be my first Amazon review but I have been purchasing from Amazon for years.,1781,1
1781,The reason why this is my first review is because this purse was such a disappointment that I feel so strongly about warning others before purchasing this piece.,1781,1
1781,I have been searching for a medium sized bag that can be a crossbody bag without the small straps making it a shoulder bag.,1781,1
1781,Low and behold after weeks of searching I found this purse I actually liked aesthetically as well.,1781,1
1781,"I was excited to finally have an everyday purse that was convenient enough to be a crossbody purse which is what I needed, considering I have a one year old I'm constantly running errands with.",1781,1
1781,"Personally, if I'm paying $35 for a bag I'm not expecting a Louis Vuitton quality, but I AM expecting a purse that doesn't fall apart within the first 2 days of use.",1781,1
1781,"The link holding the tassel to the zipper broke as I was leaving a store, kind of embarrassing but ok.",1781,1
1781,I brought it home and had my bf use some pliers to close the link.,1781,1
1781,Literally the next day the swivel that holds the strap to the purse popped out as was bringing groceries in and my purse fell off of my body and onto the slushy gross ground.,1781,1
1781,At that point I was infuriated.,1781,1
1781,I tried attaching the clasp to the other metal link but it kept slipping out of the broken gap from the swivel breaking.,1781,1
1781,"I will be returning this poorly made, piece of s**t that is no where near $35.",1781,1
1782,It was extremely small.,1782,1
1782,I gave it to my 5 year old niece.,1782,1
1783,This bracelet came with ugly little charms that were not the same ones shown.,1783,1
1783,The 'stronger than you believe' saying can't be read no matter how much anybody squints.,1783,1
1783,It looks like chicken scratch.,1783,1
1783,My daughter went thru a life changing event that was so difficult and yet she was so brave and strong and I thought this was perfect.,1783,1
1783,I just requested a return and now the seller is saying they'll get back to me in 48 hours.,1783,1
1783,If they won't accept my return request it'll go in the trash.,1783,1
1783,I will say that I have purchased from this seller before and was happy with what I received.,1783,1
1783,This bracelet will be perfect for anybody with superman's vision and fluent in chicken scratch language!,1783,1
1783,"Perhaps I'm judging the readability too harsh because there are 2 charms on it that weren't shown in description and they both are large enough to CLEARLY advertise with both saying in large print ""Chubby Chico Charms"".",1783,1
1783,If they won't accept my return request maybe I'll request if I can get some sort of reimbursement for advertisement because the company info is the only thing that's clear.,1783,1
1784,Adult medium that fit like a youth large.,1784,1
1785,Junk.,1785,1
1785,Came with two different size pins.,1785,1
1785,Can't be bothered to return,1785,1
1786,"shoulder elastic very wide & tight , cheap looking & feels horrible.",1786,1
1786,pictures of this shirt are very deceiving.,1786,1

1786,Requested  a refund!,1786,1
1787,Zipper broke by itself first use,1787,1
1788,This arrived appearing very cheaply made.,1788,1
1788,The beading is gaudy and not attractive.,1788,1
1788,The underneath layer sticks to the top lace layer in a weird way as well.,1788,1
1788,It's a very low quality lace.,1788,1
1788,"It does not look like the picture, which was a huge letdown because I was so excited to receive it.",1788,1
1788,There is no way I will ever wear this dress.,1788,1
1789,"not ""fit over sunglasses"" they're just wide glasses.",1789,1
1790,"I'm 5 feet, about 130 lbs, 36B.",1790,1
1790,I can wear most mediums.,1790,1
1790,Figure I can't go wrong ordering a large.,1790,1
1790,It did go very wrong.,1790,1
1790,"Material has no stretch to it, can't even squeeze into this dress.",1790,1
1791,When I try to put them on the zipper opens so they are totally unwearable.,1791,1
1791,very disappointed,1791,1
1792,"sizing needs to be addressed,kids stuff.",1792,1

1795,The area for bust is way too high.,1795,1
1795,I don't think this was made for humans with boobs.,1795,1
1795,The material smelt like dirty feet when I opened up the package.,1795,1
1795,It's not worth it.,1795,1
1795,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,1795,1

1801,"First off, it does not look anything like the picture what so ever!!!!!!!!!",1801,1

1808,It's a pretty dress but I ordered a medium and received a small.,1808,1
1808,The top part is tiny and therefore it didn't fit.,1808,1
1808,I contacted the seller but have yet to get a response.,1808,1

1811,"I thought ""double knit"" went out in the 1980s.",1811,1
1811,"Apparently, it's back.",1811,1
1811,This is heavy double knit fabric... definitely not something I'd wear.,1811,1
1812,poor quality and workmanship.,1812,1
1812,Fit is unusual shape.,1812,1

1818,"So, here is my revised review strictly about the item I received as it were:

Wow, this ""washed black"" hat is not at all like the photo!",1818,1
1818,"I was expecting a faded, grayish black color but it's more of a khaki color.",1818,1
1818,In fact it looks identical to the khaki color hat they sell.,1818,1
1818,Not sure how the black hat I ordered came to be a completely different color!,1818,1
1818,I would say it's a fine hat but if it fades that fast during delivery then I can only give it one star.,1818,1
1818,"Sizing for ""medium"" is small/medium per the label and fit fine for me as a woman with average to small head.",1818,1
1818,Would have kept it if the black hat were actually the color I was expecting.,1818,1
1819,The band broke the 1st week I received it ...0 -1stars,1819,1

1823,"The picture looks great, but this is not how the product looks.",1823,1

1823,It's definitely NOT a toe RING!,1823,1
1824,These leg warmers almost severed my babies toe because the stitching is so loose on the inside that her toes got caught and wrapped around them every time we tried them on.,1824,1
1824,They all were like that in addition to 2 of them having holes on them from what looks to be questionable workmanship.,1824,1
1824,Now we can't return them because they return policy ended yesterday.,1824,1
1824,"( We bought them before the baby was born, so we just started to use to 2 days ago)",1824,1

1841,The blouse was an  X-large .,1841,1
1842,I was very happy to receive this ring.,1842,1

1842,So all and all not happy at all,1842,1
1843,I would like these more if I actually got them.,1843,1
1843,The little bag they came in was empty.,1843,1
1844,To small smells bad and first watch the black faints away.,1844,1
1845,The size must have been wrong or just truly doesn't fit true to size.,1845,1
1845,My 14 year old daughter could fit it and she wears a size 6 in juniors.,1845,1
1846,The receiver even started burning a hole through the wireless charger.,1846,1
1846,"The receiver now has a hole through it, but the charger still works with my brothers phone.",1846,1

1860,My Wife (asian) is a size extra small so we ordered the XS and this dress is absolutly huge.,1860,1
1860,Why have a picture of an asian girl when the size XS that you advertise is XS for non asians.,1860,1

2075,"It's just a piece of fabric sewn onto a stretchy vest but the outer fabric has no shape at all, not contured as pictured.",2075,1

2076,Horrible buy I'm really angry about it!,2076,1

2143,"I wasn't sure if they were labeled wrong or that's how they see a child's 4/4.5, but I REALLY needed these shoes...",2143,1
2144,I ordered this item as a 2x but when I tried it on there was no way on earth this was meant for an adult.,2144,1

2151,My expectation of this beautiful vintage dress was less than positive .,2151,1
2151,The picture that is reflected did not meet that expectation and I was greatly disappointed ..,2151,1

2157,"In person, it's garbage.",2157,1

2157,Unbelievable!,2157,1

2159,"When I went to return it, they approved the return, but then expected me to pay for return shipping--- of a DAMAGED product.",2159,1
2159,Sweater is very thin and seems like it would be comfy to lounge around in.,2159,1
2159,"But, cheap as it is, NOT worth the hassle.",2159,1
2159,I've already spent more time trying to return this than the sweater is actually worth.,2159,1
2159,"Now, I'm basically doing it on principle.",2159,1
2160,"Well first of all, this shirt fits me well, but it does NOT go down on one shoulder like the picture portrays!",2160,1

2160,"Overall, I do not like this brand and think it was a complete waste of money.",2160,1
2160,I wouldn't ever buy from them again.,2160,1
2161,The images and description don't elude to how much this looks like a khaki windbreaker.,2161,1
2161,"If you like function without fashion, this is ideal.",2161,1
2162,"They must use a different instrument to measure clothing wherever the pants were made- I ordered 32"" length but received 36.""",2162,1

2168,I can't wear this...,2168,1
2169,The fabric is VERY thin and unlined.,2169,1
2169,The bottoms are not lined so everybody would know your business BEFORE they even got wet.,2169,1
2169,"Most underwear at least has a bit of lining in the crotch and bathing suits definitely, but not these.",2169,1
2169,The top is just a piece of fabric like a scarf.,2169,1
2169,"I had not planned to use it as a top, so that was fine.",2169,1

2181,"Unfortunately, even after purchasing one size smaller than I needed (if I had gone by the chart), I'm finding that it doesn't fit properly.",2181,1
2181,It's constantly falling down and very inconvenient to wear.,2181,1
2181,"Maybe I need to go one size smaller, but according to the sizing chart, that would be way too small.",2181,1
2181,It's really disappointing because I really needed this product to work for me and it doesn't.,2181,1
2181,"When it arrived, it also smelled REALLY terrible - as if it had taken a wash in a chemical bath.",2181,1
2181,"I had to wash the thing TWICE to make it wearable, and even then, I could still smell some of the chemicals on it.",2181,1
2181,I'm not impressed and it doesn't exactly make me want it on my body to begin with.,2181,1

2185,The printing on the shirt faded so bad after the first was you couldn't wear again,2185,1
2186,Chain broke within a week of receiving necklace...,2186,1

2193,No tags.,2193,1
2193,There was a human hair stuck to one of them (ewww).,2193,1
2193,"I had planned on giving these as a gift, but I will have to find something else.",2193,1
2193,"I would not feel safe giving these to a baby that was going to put them in their mouth, and the lack of tag and packaging would make it look like I was giving a beat up used set of rattles with a dirty old hair on it.",2193,1
2193,No thanks.,2193,1
2194,Looks nothing like the picture.,2194,1
2194,Waste of money.,2194,1

2200,Hope this company enjoys my donatiion.,2200,1
2200,The shirt is garbage!,2200,1
2201,I was very disappointed.,2201,1
2201,I thought I was getting woman's plus size and it was not even a woman's small.,2201,1
2201,I had numerous tiny girlfriends even try it on to fit them and their torso was too long.,2201,1
2201,I did not want to deal with the hassle of returning it.,2201,1
2201,"I gave it to my girlfriends 6 year old daughter, to make her feel pretty in a dress.",2201,1
2202,It's super wise and short.,2202,1
2202,It is an odd shape.,2202,1
2202,I could tell something was off about it before I even attempted to put it on.,2202,1
2203,I feel compelled to let people know that the straps connected to the top of the backpack broke after one use.,2203,1
2203,Perhaps it would hold up as a pocket book but definitely isn't for school books.,2203,1
2204,Not like the picture,2204,1
2205,came with the tint folded.,2205,1
2205,not worth sending back but complete trash,2205,1
2206,I needed this to protect my babies head from her scratching.,2206,1
2206,However the material is so rough it did more harm than good,2206,1
2207,Fits small and short.,2207,1
2207,Thin material.,2207,1
2208,They feel a bit rickety and one arm popped off after about 2 months of normal wear.,2208,1
2209,I knew I was in trouble when this hat arrived in a tiny box.,2209,1
2209,I opened it to find the hat balled up and stuffed inside.,2209,1
2209,I was never going to be able to get all the wrinkles out so I put it back in the box and returned it immediately.,2209,1

2212,It looked like I was wearing a trash bag..,2212,1
2212,I threw it away.,2212,1
2213,I received my package today.,2213,1
2213,It came with only 3 colors.,2213,1

2213,I expected one of each color as in the picture of this item.,2213,1
2213,"I did not receive the red, navy or brown.",2213,1
2213,I cannot comment on the fit or quality as my daughter hasn't worn them yet.,2213,1

2352,it is a warm coat and fur looks real from afar but hands down not worth 80 freaking USD the coat is not advertised correctly because no one would buy it if they knew the truth,2352,1
2353,"First off nothing,like the picture and you have to have a really short torso and possibly flat chest cause this doesn't do anything for me or my shape.",2353,1
2353,You would have to be a tiny short torso person with no chest to make this look decent.,2353,1
2354,I like the product but it cut to big,2354,1
2355,"Super small, unless ur anorexic with skinny wrist this might be OK.",2355,1

2361,"I'm 5'8, 185.",2361,1
2361,"I ordered an XL, because I have more luck with one size larger when I order online.",2361,1
2361,"First, the material is cheap and flimsy.",2361,1
2361,"It was poorly sewn, it ripped immediately, and there was a fabric pull on the top by the chest.",2361,1
2361,"Second, I couldn't get it over my head.",2361,1
2361,That's when I realized it must be too small.,2361,1
2361,I couldn't breathe completely without risking ripping the top.,2361,1
2361,"By the time I got it all the way on, there was no shape and it wasn't long at all.",2361,1
2361,It stopped right below my knee.,2361,1
2361,"Plus, the slit is more towards the middle than the side.",2361,1

2370,Made in China and did not take into account American sizes.,2370,1

2370,No way to contact seller to correct order,2370,1
2371,"Really stiff plastic-like leather, zipper broke immediately, inside zipper fell apart from pouch.",2371,1
2371,I honestly wish I hadn't of purchased this.,2371,1
2372,They bend a break fairly easily.,2372,1
2372,Also they begin to hurt my eyes if I wear them for any extended period of time.,2372,1

2373,Not worth it.,2373,1

2377,"The latch came off the first time it was opened, and the hinges are awful.",2377,1
2377,Don't waste your money.,2377,1
2378,The first problem is the sizing of these shoes.,2378,1
2378,"I wear a mens size 9.5 M, I ordered a mens 10 M expecting to get a little extra room.",2378,1
2378,What I got instead was a shoe that was more in line with a size 7 narrow.,2378,1
2378,I could not even fit my toes in the opening.,2378,1
2378,"The shoe is clearly stamped 10M, definitely a mis-sizing.",2378,1
2378,The other problem had to do with the quality of the shoe's upper part.,2378,1
2378,The canvas used is very thin and flimsy feeling.,2378,1
2378,Also the seams were all ragged and unfinished on the inside.,2378,1
2378,I returned them immediately and will not be considering Vans in the future.,2378,1

2386,"Long wait, item is garbage, getting a refund is a big hassle ...Seller did finally refund 100%
What a waste of time.",2386,1
2387,I waited a week to get this item in the mail and when it did come it was the wrong item,2387,1
2388,Shirt is cute and stylish for younger ladies.,2388,1
2388,Very thin and flimsy.,2388,1
2388,I bought the xxl for my daughter because of the upper portion is xxl.,2388,1
2388,She put the tshirt on and it just covered upper portion.,2388,1
2388,So that was a bust.,2388,1
2388,We we ended up giving to my niece who is slim and trim and wears a medium size top.,2388,1
2388,This xxl tshirt almost fit like she usually wears her tshirts  She wears her tshirt snug and a little 1/4 inch of her hips showing.,2388,1
2388,The shirt covered her hips and was slightly loose but not by any means oversized.,2388,1
2388,I'm not sure if it was sized wrong or that's how they make all the tshirts.,2388,1
2388,No I would not buy again because not knowing exactly how the sizing works but for an inexpensive tshirt well worth it.,2388,1

2391,Very small,2391,1
2392,This dress was EXTREMELY long.,2392,1
2392,"I'm 5'8"" o imaging how long it had to be.",2392,1
2392,Cute dress otherwise.,2392,1
2393,Terrible material,2393,1

2394,Even tiny hair stubble!,2394,1
2394,It also runs small as far as size goes.,2394,1
2395,Shirt was too small and not the dusty rose color as posted.,2395,1

2396,Material not as expected.,2396,1
2396,Will give to Salvation Army or goodwill,2396,1
2397,Wanted to wear for my birthday but it was too big so I ended up using the shirt as pajamas,2397,1
2398,I wasn't that impressed this fit to size but didn't look like the picture.,2398,1
2398,It looked like a computer printed version of the dress in the picture.,2398,1
2398,The pattern isn't even the same.,2398,1
2398,I still use the product over swim suits and ect.,2398,1
2398,Not what I thought it was going to be though.,2398,1
2399,Bought this on cyber Monday came in mail yesterday...I checked the item before I was going to wrap it only to see that one of the gems was discolored and stood out.,2399,1
2399,Very unsatisfied.,2399,1
2399,Sending back.,2399,1
2399,The 4 gem down on the right side...,2399,1
2400,this fit my 11 year old daughter :( and the arm pads are very low on the forearms,2400,1
2401,Don't know in what universe this was a large but it's not this one.,2401,1
2401,I'm usually an 8 or 10 and this fit like a 4.,2401,1

2402,"Chain low quality and tangles easily, even when wearing.",2402,1
2403,I returned the item for a refund.,2403,1
2403,Their size chart is incorrect.,2403,1
2403,I physically measured my head before I made my purchase.,2403,1
2403,I measured exactly where the band would go around my head and selected the size dictated by that measurement.,2403,1
2403,I purchased the hat size which THEY identified.,2403,1
2403,"When the hat arrived, it was too big and absolutely no way to keep it on my head.",2403,1
2403,I needed the next size smaller.,2403,1
2403,"Instead of simply sending a replacement of the smaller size, they refused and will ONLY issue a refund once I return it at my expense and will NOT be sending the next smaller size.",2403,1
2403,I will then have to re-order.,2403,1
2403,No thanks.,2403,1
2403,"So, this was not my fault since I depended upon their size chart.",2403,1
2403,I won't be reordering this product.,2403,1
2404,This sweatshirt is so small.,2404,1
2404,I ordered a women's X-large because I'm chesty but I think it is a child's sweatshirt.,2404,1
2404,I gave it to a 10 year old and it fits her!,2404,1
2405,WAY TOO SHORT!!,2405,1
2405,And the arms were too tight,2405,1
2406,"Did not like this, too short, too small and the fabric was not soft",2406,1
2407,"I liked the feel of it, I loved the color, I liked the fit but I don't care for the sheer look so I returned it.",2407,1
2408,Fits perfect and seems like it would have been very nice.,2408,1
2408,"However, this item was delivered crushed and bent out of shape.",2408,1
2408,It's pretty much ruined.,2408,1
2409,so cheap,2409,1
2410,"Even with he size guide, still too small.",2410,1
2411,The first day I got them the lense came out and broke  they are cute but didn't get to wear them,2411,1
2412,Huge.,2412,1
2412,Too big unless for gypsie Halloween costume.,2412,1

2413,"Also they are kinda short, got an M and I'm 5.5.",2413,1
2414,I didn't understand the sizing.,2414,1
2414,It's very small.,2414,1
2414,Maybe even kid size.,2414,1
2415,something that an old trailer park kind of hooker would wear.,2415,1
2415,Ripped at the seams after a couple minutes of trying on.,2415,1
2415,Definitely junk.,2415,1
2416,Cheap looking.,2416,1
2416,The ropes are not seperated and you can see the metal underneath.,2416,1
2416,Cheap looking.,2416,1
2417,"This was literally made for a child -- or a very petite, short-torsoed person.",2417,1
2418,REALLY not worth the wait.... terrible misrepresentation!!,2418,1

2420,Way small!,2420,1
2420,Ordered an extra large and it was barely a shirt let alone a dress.,2420,1
2420,Funny because I ordered the blue from another seller and it was the same material and fit great.,2420,1
2421,This is awful.,2421,1
2421,I am 5'4 185 lbs and wear 38G bra.,2421,1
2421,I ordered an XL to see if it would work.,2421,1
2421,The top is EXTREMELY SMALL.,2421,1
2421,There is maybe 4 inches of material in the front too cover your chest and no elasticity under for support.,2421,1
2421,You fall out.,2421,1
2421,"The bottoms are weird, do not stretch and dig into your theighs.",2421,1
2421,I returned this the same day received.,2421,1
2422,"Sad, loved these, wore them once and one broke.",2422,1
2423,Not happy w/ this dress.,2423,1
2423,"In the picture it looks pink being the reason I ordered it, but it's red ugh.",2423,1
2423,It's way to big and to long.,2423,1
2424,"The sizes are so, so, small.",2424,1
2424,My daughter is a size small and we had to order a large.,2424,1
2424,They are nice pjs but the sizes run extremely small.,2424,1
2425,the bottoms did not fit at all,2425,1
2426,It was my fault.,2426,1
2426,I wanted  Black pocket tank tops.,2426,1
2426,While going back and forth I decided to go with this brand.,2426,1
2426,"when going back to the item to order, it went from black to this UGLY green.",2426,1
2426,Like i said my fault.,2426,1
2426,"On another note unlike this picture, the shirt does not have a pocket which i really need.",2426,1
2426,I seems to be well made but because it has no pocket like the picture showed I won't buy this brand again.,2426,1
2427,Complete waste of money.,2427,1
2428,Didn't meet expectations,2428,1
2429,"Too Small, buy a size UP !",2429,1

2432,I am regifting these to my daughter,2432,1
2433,I ordered 2 sizes bigger and it still didn't fit.,2433,1
2434,Size runs small.,2434,1
2434,"Decent coat, but would not work for real low temperatures.",2434,1
2434,Seems well made.,2434,1
2435,The clicker was absolutely awful and did not stick.,2435,1
2435,the nose ring tried to fall out at every opportunity and the whole piece felt cheap and insecure especially for the price.,2435,1
2436,looks like something you'd get at the dollar store.,2436,1
2437,Horrible!,2437,1
2438,JUNK,2438,1
2439,Very cheesy knockoff,2439,1
2440,I have no complaints with this vendor.,2440,1
2440,However I did not like this chain.,2440,1
2440,The very top of this necklace looked very slave like to me when I put it on.,2440,1
2440,That wasn't the look I was going for.,2440,1
2440,"Although I didn't like my purchase, I would purchase from this vendor again.",2440,1

2441,Its not long sleeve which is what I wanted.,2441,1
2441,The material is not soft.,2441,1
2441,I just don't like this shirt.,2441,1
2442,Disappointed.,2442,1
2442,Very small and cheaply made.,2442,1
2442,I returned it as it looks much better in the picture than in real life.,2442,1
2443,Not true to size.,2443,1
2443,But I'm above average tall and fat so don't listen to me.,2443,1
2443,Basically what I'm saying is- don't go by your regular size when purchasing clothes.,2443,1
2443,Order up.,2443,1
2444,Very cheap in quality,2444,1
2445,"It is poor in quality and runs extra small, even buying a size up doesn't help.",2445,1
2445,The customer service is even worse.,2445,1
2445,I have been trying to return this item for weeks and have received no response from the seller.,2445,1
2445,"Just remember the old saying ""you get what you pay for""....",2445,1
2445,I only gave 1 star because it's required AND it arrived earlier than expected.,2445,1
2446,I received mine and it did not have grooves on it to be able to screw it into the top and bottom.,2446,1
2446,"Also, the wholes were not clearly drilled/grooved on one of the half circles.",2446,1
2446,I can't actually use this retainer.,2446,1
2446,See photo.,2446,1
2447,It was a whole size smaller than advertised.,2447,1
2447,It is packaged badly and looks nothing like picture.,2447,1
2447,The skirt is made totally different.,2447,1
2448,This is the second bathing suit I have ordered and they both came in the wrong size.,2448,1
2448,I was very careful when I ordered this one and read all of the description.,2448,1
2448,It was listed in number sizes such as 10.,2448,1
2448,12.,2448,1
2448,14 etc but when the suit arrived it was an extra large.,2448,1
2448,I will never order any more of them.,2448,1
2449,"Tight
Did not like it overall, so returned",2449,1
2450,It was to small even tho I got medium and it had a stain on it once I received it,2450,1
2451,"I followed the size chart provided by the seller, but it was an odd fit.",2451,1
2451,I'm a petite woman with a bust size of 32C and ordered a size medium.,2451,1
2451,The top was wide fitting but lacked in vertical chest length.,2451,1
2451,I could not pull it down low enough to cover the bottom of my breasts without revealing my areola (nipple).,2451,1
2451,"I was also unable to tighten the bikini top from the back because of the bikini design, so it was very loose fitting.",2451,1
2451,The top was also made of see through material.,2451,1
2451,You could see the oddly shaped breast pads very clearly.,2451,1
2451,I didn't even bother to put the bottoms on because there was some type of black ink or grease residue near the crotch area.,2451,1
2451,"The bottoms were also see through material, so there is no way I would ever wear them and risk showing my ""goodies.""",2451,1
2451,I would suggest that the seller provide more under bust material and make the appropriate adjustments to both their bikinis and size chart.,2451,1
2451,The bottom looked nothing like the bikini bottom shown in the picture.,2451,1
2451,It looked more like the old-in-day swimsuit where they are hiked up really high versus resting on the hips.,2451,1
2452,The material of the Cape doesn't fit anything like it shows in the picture.,2452,1
2452,It is a very stiff mesh that makes the hood stand straight up and not even get close to resting on your head like it should.,2452,1
2453,Impossible to get rid of the terrible smell of this bag.,2453,1
2453,I tried everything.,2453,1
2453,Now I will donate it.,2453,1
2454,Look nothing like the pic,2454,1
2455,This is definitely a junior fit not women's.,2455,1
2455,Disappointed.,2455,1
2455,Will donate or return.,2455,1
2456,Poor quality and VERY large!,2456,1
2456,Returned.,2456,1
2457,Horrible.,2457,1
2457,Stupid fit.,2457,1
2457,Garbage.,2457,1
2457,Don't buy it,2457,1
2458,HORRIBLE JUST HORRIBLE!,2458,1
2458,the material is very cheap and it runs really small.,2458,1
2458,It looks NOTHING like the picture.,2458,1
2458,I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE!!,2458,1
2458,!,2458,1

2576,"I used my exact measurements and it technically fits, but as a bad peplum top instead of a short dress.",2576,1
2576,"The fabric felt like the kind used on cheap halloween costumes, and the moon appliqu looks like a bad iron on.",2576,1
2577,I don't recommend no one to buy this dress...,2577,1
2577,I order a xlarge and the xlarge come in like a extra small so this dress is for petite small small size people... Children,2577,1
2578,Should have a little flexibility at the sides for contour fit,2578,1
2579,"The top has pads, but they're loose & just move around any which way.",2579,1
2579,ThE bottom is see through.,2579,1

2581,!,2581,1
2582,Too small I cannot wear it and I am a samll size  2,2582,1

2585,Was not what I thought I was ordering.,2585,1
2585,Misleading image!,2585,1
2585,While this product could work for some it did not work for me and our baby.,2585,1
2585,"The size seemed to be as expected however material looks different from what you see in the image, also in the image you can see there are snap ons between the legs and there is nothing like that in the item that arrived.",2585,1
2585,It also fit our baby differently.,2585,1
2585,Who would make baby overalls without snap on is beyond me.,2585,1
2585,So to change out baby I had to take overall off completely and it is inconvenient to say the least if you are not at home.,2585,1
2585,A lot of places don't have changing stations and you have improvise at times and this just make it so much harder.,2585,1
2585,If I knew it wasn't a snap on at the bottom would not have ordered it.,2585,1
2585,"We got this for our private wedding ceremony, in hopes for baby's comfort and to match daddy's suit, so by the time it arrived there was no time to order something else.",2585,1
2585,The quality is also very poor.,2585,1
2585,The threads were hanging off of it everywhere.,2585,1
2585,I spent good 10 min cutting them off.,2585,1
2585,"When it came out of the washer and dryer it was so wrinkled and straps were so terrible looking, I had to iron the straps and the collar and the rest of the overalls.",2585,1
2585,"Not to mention the image showed that the stars have more than one button on each side leading you to believe straps can be adjusted, which is also misleading.",2585,1

2587,It was too small eve though I orders a size larger.,2587,1
2587,The material looked like some cheap wax paper,2587,1
2588,Very poorly made and all 3 were different sizes,2588,1
2589,It's not even close to the one in the picture.,2589,1
2589,It looks awfu!,2589,1
2590,Horrible fabric.,2590,1
2590,Does not stay on shoulders at all.,2590,1
2591,Too small...for  president teens,2591,1
2592,This is a Joke of a necklace.,2592,1
2592,It's not even a necklace.,2592,1
2592,It is several cheap beads from a craft store GLUED on a piece of felt paper.,2592,1
2592,It looks as if 2nd graders made it in Arts & Crafts on a piece of felt like paper.,2592,1
2592,"Oh yea, let's not forget it TIES in the back.",2592,1
2592,It's horrible and a joke.,2592,1
2592,How could anyone with a frickin business offer cheap pathetic items such as this to their customers?,2592,1
2592,"Do you NOT want re-orders, customers coming back and longevity?",2592,1
2592,I guess not.,2592,1
2592,Do Not Order This Thing!,2592,1
2593,I bought this dress for a marine ball.,2593,1
2593,"Once the dress arrived, it was WAYYY too small, looked fairly cheap, and the front came up really high.",2593,1
2593,I had to return it and find another dress last minute.,2593,1
2593,"Very disappointing, I wanted to love this dress.",2593,1
2594,Though this is a beautiful shirt It was the wrong size.,2594,1
2594,I ordered an xxx Large however the shirt I received was a medium.,2594,1
2594,"In addition it didn't include any size tags, type of fabric or washing instructions.",2594,1
2594,As you can see in the picture below It's clearly not an xxx Large.,2594,1
2595,Doesn't have crotch snaps for easy diaper change?,2595,1
2595,"These are for small children, have to completely undress them.",2595,1
2595,It's a shame because it is very cute,2595,1
2596,not what i expected,2596,1
2597,Imagine someone in China clipped a head hole out of the giant triangle.,2597,1
2597,Then shoved it in a bag.,2597,1
2597,"Sorry to be so harsh, but I can find nothing redeeming about this ""Tshirt"".",2597,1
2597,It's my brand new dusting rag.,2597,1
2598,Very cheap material.,2598,1
2598,Didn't last,2598,1
2599,this product size is to small and according to me a cardigan is wool not normal material .,2599,1
2600,Fit horribly.,2600,1
2600,Cheaply made.,2600,1
2601,Terrible wore it once and the same day it broke!,2601,1
2602,Very small and cheap made I have to return,2602,1
2603,"Everything on this case is great, ACCEPT the ability to click the top button to turn phone off and that  makes it useless.. Do not buy",2603,1
2604,This came in looking gigantic on my face.,2604,1
2604,It is way to big and very unflattering.,2604,1
2605,"Like the other reviews, the two strands are not equal in length and it looks nothing like the choker in the pictures.",2605,1
2605,Very unflattering.,2605,1
2606,Pettycoat had multiple rips and was much shorter than anticipated.,2606,1
2606,The only plus is that the waistband is made of a smooth girdle like material.,2606,1
2606,the rest was pretty terrible though.,2606,1
2607,I purchased three of these braclets for me and my best friends for one of their weddings and three boxes came but two of the boxes were empty!,2607,1
2607,There was no bracket in the jewelry box!,2607,1
2607,Total scam and rip off!,2607,1
2608,The quality to this dress is so poor.,2608,1
2608,Complete waste of money.,2608,1
2608,It looks nothing like the photo.,2608,1
2608,VERY CHEAP LOOKING DRESS.,2608,1
2608,I would not wear it.,2608,1
2609,Despite the advertised size these shorts are several sized too small.,2609,1
2609,They are cute and would be great if they actually fitted.,2609,1
2610,"Fit was as expected, material was not!",2610,1
2610,"I really was hoping to love these when they came in as I received the go ahead at work to wear them, while passing meds ( something different as I am tired of wearing cargo pants all the time and its always warm in work).",2610,1
2610,"The material is some type of shiny, scratchy and to me nasty feeling (I am a texture person).",2610,1
2610,They were immediately returned and I do not think I will try this seller again.,2610,1
2611,Trash.,2611,1
2611,They broke before I could even try them on once.,2611,1
2612,It sucks,2612,1
2613,Do not waste your money.,2613,1
2613,My son wore these once and the sole insert was coming unglued and the material was pulling away from the rubber in the toe.,2613,1
2613,Terrible manufacturing.,2613,1
2613,Have to go and buy another pair after one week of summer camp...,2613,1
2614,I could not even wear this hat it was so small.,2614,1
2614,The Velcro is on elastic which gives the illusion that it would somewhat stretch to fit but instead the Velcro comes open and kept getting stuck in my hair.,2614,1
2614,I had a couple girlfriends on the trip that tried it as well and it didn't fit them either.,2614,1
2615,Sadly this suit came with half of the white bow (that you see between the polka-dot breasts) sewn on the inside!,2615,1
2615,Are you kidding me?!,2615,1
2615,I saw some reviews that stated this and so I figured the manufacture would have resolved this issue before sending any more suits out to customers...but no...mine came that same way!,2615,1
2615,There really was no way to fix it.,2615,1
2615,"If the suit had been absolutely adorable, I might have looked into fixing it....but it wasn't that adorable in the first place.",2615,1
2615,Such a waste of time on my part.,2615,1
2615,Don't do it.,2615,1
2616,This item  was not as pictured.,2616,1
2616,I ordered grey and they sent me baby blue.,2616,1
2616,The material was terrible and I will never wear it.,2616,1
2616,Waste of money!,2616,1
2616,!,2616,1
2617,"too small, thin material...",2617,1
2618,The hinge fell off when first opened - a real disappointment.,2618,1
2618,Then a second similar Rosee box arrived (unordered) and this one - the light didn't work.,2618,1
2618,My advice - order from a different manufacturer,2618,1
2619,Big and ugly.,2619,1
2619,Tacky panties.,2619,1
2620,Seem unraveled in two different places (after 2 wears).,2620,1
2621,I'm 5'9 it's not made for someone with Big hips,2621,1
2622,Terrible quality and useless.,2622,1
2622,Skirt material was stuck together.,2622,1
2622,The pattern was ruined when pulled apart.,2622,1
2622,I do not recommend to anyone!,2622,1
2622,Don't take a chance.,2622,1
2623,Very small and I followed the size chart.,2623,1

2624,Phone keep moving.,2624,1
2625,"Really cheap product, I bought it twice... the first time when the chain broke I thought it was my daughters fault, she liked it so much I ordered another one and with in 4 days it had broke as well!!!",2625,1
2625,My son was born on august 6th and within a months two necklaces had been ordered and damage... bad product!!,2625,1
2625,!,2625,1
2626,The Material is Very FLIMSY.....CHEAP,2626,1
2627,Nope.,2627,1
2627,"This is the exact same ""Active Basics"" shirt that thirty sellers are offering under thirty different names, and it's thirty kinds of lousy.",2627,1
2627,"The Large fits like a 6-8 (a ""regular"" cut Small or a snug-fit Medium), the body is too short, the sleeves are too short, it is TINY.",2627,1
2627,"If you're under five feet tall and enjoy purchasing tops two sizes bigger than normal just to be able to get them over your shoulders, or you prefer your shirts to fit like sausage casing, then by all means, click ""buy now.""",2627,1
2627,"Otherwise, look elsewhere.",2627,1
2627,"If this were actually sized and cut in a reasonable manner, it would be a fine shirt.",2627,1
2627,"It's thin but not see-through (in black, anyway), fabric isn't scratchy, and the wrist and hem seams stretch well.",2627,1
2627,"If you're a size 10-12 or larger, though, avoid.",2627,1
2628,"I was truly excited to get these, since I'm an organize freak and will be traveling again soon.",2628,1
2628,"They arrived and the large ""cube""  was already falling apart.",2628,1
2628,"I won't be ordering these again, I'll find another way to organize my luggage.",2628,1
2628,"Don't buy, waste of money.",2628,1
2629,"I don't recommend, my piercings got infected",2629,1
2630,"I'm am 5""4' and 123, I ordered a medium, too tight and not very long.",2630,1
2630,I got this to go under my short shirts to cover my butt.,2630,1
2630,It only goes over maybe half.,2630,1
2630,It is also very thin and see through.,2630,1
2631,"I ordered an xxl so the top is a pre-formed cup THAT was maybe a medium with the tie around was super long, and I'm being nice about the bottoms were more like a 3x.",2631,1
2631,sad cuz its looks totally cute,2631,1
2632,I was excited for this dress based on the reviews with such a good price attached but it was too good to be true.,2632,1
2632,I bought a large based on the size chart and it is too small.,2632,1
2632,I think the material is nice and sewn well but I'm not a fan of the print after seeing it in person.,2632,1
2632,It looks cheap and like a mistake printing.,2632,1
2632,It's always a gamble buying from these off clothing makers and I guess mine didn't pay off!,2632,1
2633,I normally wear a size XL and I decided to buy the 3X with the thought it would be able to wear with a sweater.,2633,1
2633,Not only would it not fit over a sweater it wouldn't go around me at all.,2633,1
2633,There is runs small and there is this.,2633,1
2634,not at all what I thought they would be.,2634,1
2634,and one of the earrings balls already fell off...,2634,1
2634,I just got it today,2634,1
2635,The sizes definitely run smaller than they say,2635,1
2636,"Cheap quality fabric, almost costumy.",2636,1
2637,Very bad quality i don't recommened,2637,1
2638,This dress was hilariously awful!,2638,1
2638,I coulnd't stop laughing when I put it on.,2638,1
2638,It didn't even cover my crotch.,2638,1
2638,The only reason my rear was covered was because it's longer in the back.,2638,1
2638,"I'm 5'9, so on the tall side and used to things being a little short on me, but I still expect dresses to cover the important bits.",2638,1
2638,"Also, for the record, the picture makes it look like an icy or sky blue- in reality it's a bright blue.",2638,1
2639,Poorly made.,2639,1
2640,I bought a 3xl and it was more like a small.,2640,1
2641,ORDERED A 2X....,2641,1
2641,FITS LIKE A XS... BOOOOO...,2641,1
2641,Very disappointed.,2641,1
2642,"So cute, but way too small.",2642,1
2642,They say XL would fit 38-40 C-D.  No way.,2642,1
2642,Wish they made these cute bra-lets in American sizes.,2642,1
2643,Cute but I don't think it is sterling,2643,1
2644,The item looked nice initially.,2644,1
2644,But by the 3rd or 4th time using the strap the edges began to fray.,2644,1
2644,After about month worth of use I stopped wearing the strap since it looked so bad.,2644,1
2644,"Not really worth purchasing, I will go real leather next time.",2644,1
2645,Way too small,2645,1
2646,I had to return this bc it was way too small.. if you order this and are curvy be ready to show some butt.,2646,1
2646,However if showing butt is what you are going for..then go for it.,2646,1
2646,I ordered this and it barely covered my butt cheeks.,2646,1
2646,"and the materaial was very thin, it does not look like good quality",2646,1
2647,"I don't like it, too thin, cheap material.",2647,1
2648,It was horrible!,2648,1
2648,Badly designed... don't waste your money.,2648,1
2649,It's not fully clear.,2649,1
2649,You can't see if there's a picture behind it.,2649,1
2649,I'm very upset with the seller.,2649,1
2650,the colors are /way/ off and the flare isn't as nice as in the product picture,2650,1
2651,If I cld give a 0 I would.,2651,1
2651,This item is definitely not made for a curvy woman and even going up 2 sizes this outfit did not fit.,2651,1
2651,The bottom gives me camel toe and the top does not for over my chest.,2651,1
2651,I'm a 36D and size 12 with small legs.,2651,1
2652,Dislike,2652,1
2653,Way too big!,2653,1
2653,I ordered a xl and normally wear a Med to large and after reading reviews of everyone saying order up 1 to 2 sizes :( trash don't waste your money on this... No support if you have more then a c cup,2653,1
2654,Very cheap....nothing like the picture,2654,1
2655,Doesn't stay on and sits weird on your wrist,2655,1
2656,"Was WAY too small for me, even after checking the size chart",2656,1
2657,cheap material.. i wore one time,2657,1
2658,Very poor quality!,2658,1
2659,The fit was so weird!,2659,1
2659,The bottoms are way too small and the top is way to big.,2659,1
2660,Not good product,2660,1
2661,"I'm a size 10, and based on concerns about it being too small, I ordered an XL.",2661,1
2661,The XL looks like a sausage casing on me!,2661,1
2661,Horrible.,2661,1
2661,"The opposite of the flowy, breezy effect I was hoping for.",2661,1
2661,"The cut is straight, not flowy or a-line, and it's skin-tight.",2661,1
2662,Broke the first time that I put them on as I was bending down to pick up my cat.,2662,1
2662,These were a birthday gift for me.,2662,1
2663,Cheap material with an eleastic waist band.,2663,1
2664,Very small but pretty if is for a very small girl.,2664,1
2664,It should be stated in the description the age range for the product.,2664,1
2665,Shoes are too big and not the right size,2665,1
2666,Flimsy!,2666,1
2667,There is not warranty to try the product.,2667,1
2667,You don't know if they'll help you or not.,2667,1
2667,They are expensive and it didn't help me.,2667,1
2667,Think twice before you get them.,2667,1
2668,the product sent was not as expected.,2668,1
2668,"The product they sent maybe be similar from the picture provided, but do NOT be fooled!",2668,1
2668,"I was expecting an elegant branch piece along with a mystic dew drop, the same as the picture, but to my surprise was given what looks to me a twig with four leaves; the gem itself is also not like the picture shown.",2668,1
2668,The gem shape and the silver like piece attached made it look like more of an eggplant.,2668,1
2668,I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.,2668,1
2668,Very disappointed.,2668,1
2669,Horrible I didn't like it.,2669,1
2669,The color it wasn't what I expect,2669,1
2670,I received an entirely different jacket than this.,2670,1
2671,This necklace is cheap and strangely shaped.,2671,1
2671,"I thought the piece of metal the dangaly things hang on was going to be curved like the picture shows, but instead it is straight and odd looking.",2671,1
2671,One of the loops of the necklace was broken when it arrived.,2671,1
2671,I tried returning it but the merchant wanted me to pay shipping and I was like...no way because shipping was more than the necklace!,2671,1
2671,Sometimes you just have to cut your losses.,2671,1
2672,This dress did not fit at all.,2672,1
2672,I couldn't get it zipped it was so small.,2672,1
2673,"Read the reviews, measured myself twice and ordered larger size than normal.",2673,1
2673,The waist and hips fit great but the chest area was a joke.,2673,1
2673,Are those cups meant for a B?,2673,1
2673,I wear a 40 F and was falling out of the chest area.,2673,1
2673,Not the first time I have had troubles finding tops or suits that would fit my waist and chest together properly.,2673,1
2674,"This product, once again, is well made but the fit is not right.",2674,1
2674,"These were listed as capris, but are ankle length and very high in the waist.",2674,1
2674,Great color though.,2674,1
2674,Disappointed to say the least.,2674,1
2675,Ugly.,2675,1
2675,threw it away.,2675,1
2675,It looked grandma like lol,2675,1
2676,This hat was not at all slouchy.,2676,1
2676,"The quality poor, cheaply made.",2676,1
2676,I did not give it as a gift as planned because it was something I would give as a gift.,2676,1
2676,I would have been totally embarrassed.,2676,1
2676,The hat shiwn in the picture  was not what I received.,2676,1
2677,The worse umbrella I have ever purchased.,2677,1
2677,Useed it 3 times and already broke!,2677,1
2677,Amazon should be ashamed for selling such a crappie product.,2677,1
2677,Now I have to buy another umbrella that actually works.,2677,1
2678,Ordered this item 2 sizes up as it was previously posted that it ran small.,2678,1
2678,"The fabric is very thin, the designs are not matched up on the seams of the bottoms.",2678,1
2678,"The bottoms run small, the bikini top uses very little fabric but the band runs big and the overlay tank runs pretty true to size.",2678,1
2678,The bikini top broke the moment I tried it on.,2678,1
2678,The top straps are held together by small thin plastic rings one of which was broke.,2678,1
2678,I kept the tank and tossed the top and bottoms.,2678,1
2679,this one is not a womens like it specifies in the description,2679,1
2680,One word: TERRIBLE,2680,1
2681,Not true to size at all.,2681,1
2681,The XL I order looks more like a small.,2681,1
2681,Very disappointed,2681,1
2682,"Based on the photo, I expected it to be loose fitting.",2682,1
2682,So I bought my correct size.,2682,1
2682,However it was form fitting.,2682,1
2682,The letters stretched across my chest and made it look hard to read.,2682,1
2682,:-(  Wish I had gotten a bigger size for the look I was going for.,2682,1
2683,Too long and they fall down - nothing to hold them up  Sorry...,2683,1
2684,Super krazy small not at all what it shd hv been,2684,1
2685,Fit very small.,2685,1
2685,I'm a size 14 and my 4yr old wears them now for his Captain America costume.,2685,1
2685,"They are a little baggy on him, but they don't fall off.",2685,1
2685,Definitely runs very small.,2685,1
2685,The quality is also questionable.,2685,1
2685,They got snagged on something and now there is a run in the fabric like a pair of pantyhose would do.,2685,1
2686,It is a very weird shaped shirt.,2686,1
2686,Bought for myself and didn't fit 11 year old daughter.,2686,1
2686,Sending back!,2686,1
2687,I ordered an xlarge and it fit like a medium.,2687,1
2687,Disappointed because it looked roomy in description.,2687,1
2688,I have only wore this watch 3 times and already the hands on the watch are broken.,2688,1
2688,They are stuck in the same spot.,2688,1
2688,"I understand you get what you paid, but that broke a little too quickly!!",2688,1
2688,I will probably take the watch part off and use it as just a bracelet.,2688,1
2689,Quality was NOT as expected,2689,1
2690,Ok so I'm not even a big gal more curvy in the right places an I wear a size 13 pants and am a 38c and a 2xl was still snug.,2690,1
2690,The thong...more like fabric and string was like a size xxsmall.,2690,1
2690,The little fabric cuff was so cheap it broke just trying it on.,2690,1
2690,Biggest waste of money...better off going to the discount store and buying a set for half the price.,2690,1
2691,This product is defective the hook and eye fasteners/clasps were already torn off the swimsuit when received.,2691,1
2691,Also - it has been almost 2 months ago that we have return this item and our refund has.,2691,1

2691,We are NOT happy.,2691,1
2691,Do not purchase!,2691,1
2691,!,2691,1
2692,"Do not buy from this company total rip off first time they sent my daughter a large then i had to pay them a second time for the supposed right size a small it fits nothing like on the picture if your over weight the fit well work maybe"" I'm posting pictures of the front and the back so everyone can see how badly made these suits are made as well it's like they took left over material and sewed them together!",2692,1
2693,This shirt is so horrible.,2693,1
2693,"Poor quality, it has strings hanging out all over the back of the shirt.",2693,1
2693,I ordered white and it was so dingy and dirty looking.,2693,1
2693,It looks like an oversized tshirt on and not complimentary at all,2693,1
2694,Way too long...I would've needed lots of alterations to make this fit.,2694,1
2694,It was very cheap-feeling material and I didn't have the time to get it altered.,2694,1
2695,seriously cannot even put this on it is so small.,2695,1
2695,My other nursing tank tops are L or XL and fit perfect.,2695,1
2695,I ordered the XXL from here and it could fit my infant.,2695,1
2696,It was  horrible,2696,1

2906,I looked at some of the other pics posted of the suit and what I received seems to be something entirely different!,2906,1
2906,There is no padding in breast area (which is fine for me) but it is so extremely sheer/thin that you can see the entire nipple right through the material!,2906,1
2906,Fine if this were being sold as lingerie but this is NOT a swimsuit.,2906,1
2906,You don't even need to hold it up to the light to see right through it!,2906,1
2906,You can see nipples and buttcrack clear as day!,2906,1

2907,I normally wear a 12 in pants and med in top.,2907,1
2907,I ordered this in a 2xl because all the reviews said it was cut small.,2907,1

2914,"But I read the reviews, so I did order a larger size.",2914,1
2914,It's still way too small!,2914,1
2914,My suggestion would be to get (for example) a size 13 if you were a size 8 or so... That's how big of a difference the sizing is!,2914,1
2915,I was so horribly disappointed in the garment.,2915,1
2915,I have lost 30 pounds and this was the first thing I was brave enough to order online without first trying it.,2915,1

2915,I had no time to re-order so I tried everything I could to get the dress clean.,2915,1
2915,I now have a dull black and dishwasher grey dingy garment that is completely useless.,2915,1
2915,This has to be a common problem and I feel that it was completely dishonest to sell me the dress at all.,2915,1
2916,Very poor quality.,2916,1

3155,Getting refund.,3155,1
3155,"Someone told me that if a model's head is cut off in the picture then the image has been stolen from another company and the seller is copying their products, but what you wind up with is something that is nothing like what was advertised.",3155,1
3155,This is the second time this has happened to me.,3155,1
3155,I'm hesitant to ever buy any clothes from the Amazon website due to this.,3155,1
3156,too small- hard to clip,3156,1

3159,"A brush was not included although it stated it would be, but the handle made is convenient for removing the jewelry.",3159,1
3159,I would not recommend.,3159,1
3160,These looked like they were sized for a small child not an adult male.,3160,1
3161,Nothing like the picture.,3161,1
3161,Sending it back,3161,1
3162,Way too small.,3162,1
3162,The material was strange and full of static that you just can't get rid of.,3162,1
3162,I'm very disappointed because the cut and shape of the dress is so cute!,3162,1
3163,"I was very upset with these , The first time I wore them they broke.",3163,1

3167,I measured myself and ordered an XL using the size chart.,3167,1
3167,"I'm 5'8"", weigh 135 lbs.",3167,1
3167,I like wearing size 10 clothing for the extra room.,3167,1
3167,An XL should have fit me using the size chart.,3167,1
3167,"However, the inner liner is thick and pushes the sleeves up.",3167,1
3167,"In other words, the shell doesn't compensate for the liner.",3167,1
3167,"Also, either I have a giant cranium or the hood size doesn't adjust for larger sizes.",3167,1
3167,The coat doesn't flare out around the bottom as it appears to do on this picture.,3167,1
3167,I removed the liner and it fit better.,3167,1
3167,I thought about using the shell as a raincoat but I have decided to donate everything to charity rather than letting it end up in a landfill.,3167,1
3167,The shell isn't water proof; it's a thin nylon material.,3167,1
3167,The whole thing smells funny.,3167,1
3167,I would have gladly paid more for a quality product that resembles the expectation the picture sets.,3167,1
3168,"I was excited to get these shorts today, but when I opened it I was shocked.",3168,1

3446,It was way too small,3446,1
3447,"It's not a cover-up, it's a t-shirt.",3447,1
3447,Had to return,3447,1

3451,"It has ridiculously long straps adjusted them as tight as they would go, and they were still not tight enough.",3451,1
3451,The padded cups inside are way too small for even the small top.,3451,1

3453,"Also, I ordered a size 8 in women's.",3453,1
3453,"This is not even a size 8 ""Shirt"" in women's or juniors.",3453,1
3453,It may work as a size 8 shirt for a teen with a freakishly small head.,3453,1
3453,I have a 20 year old niece who is a size 2 and this would be way too short as a dress and would just fit as a shirt.,3453,1

3607,"Not even three full months in, and I am unable to the the product how I intended.",3607,1
3607,"Prior to the strap breaking, it was an excellent wristlet and carried everything I needed it to (keys, cards, cash &change, and headphones) without a problem.",3607,1
3607,Now it's just av regular wallet and I have the same problem that I did before: I have no place to put it.,3607,1
3607,"Being in college, it was nice to have something like this to carry what I needed, so it would have received a 5 star.",3607,1
3607,"However, it didn't last.",3607,1
3608,"After wearing the belt for only a few hours, I have updated my review:
Updated 3-31-16 Reduced to 1 Star:
After wearing with Jeans for about e hrs, I took it off and changed into evening dress slacks and I immediately noticed 5 large cracks in the leather, where the buckle attached to the belt when the buckle was fastened,  so now the belt was ruined and I being an anal engineer, I decided to do a post mortem analysis!",3608,1
3608,"Although the belt appears to be leather it is either a very hard thin piece of leather skin or a thin hard piece of vinyl, skin, as evidenced by the belt not stretching when the buckle was closed, accordingly, it cracked in about 5 places, Investigating further, the core of the belt does not appear to be Leather but rather, some sort of compressed paper or cardboard, with a faux suede lining and the 3 part sandwich was sewn together along both edges, to give the false impression that it is thick leather, Which it is NOT,

The buckle is fine and relatively Heavy Duty so I removed it and threw the leather away, In addition there were left over strings of thread along the sides, left over from the stitching, which I originally had to cut off, Amazon may be sourcing these belts from different sources in China at this selling price point, which may explain why some people are satisfied while others are not satisfied, I did order a more expensive Arthur Italian Leather belt from Amazon, however, it was $27.95 versus $7.99 for this replica belt, so I guess the learning for me was it was way too cheap to be anything but a fake belt,

Original Review 3-29-16: 2 Stars:
The Belt is thick + buckle is rather heavy duty, but leather has a few dent holes in finished side, in addition it is too thick + too wide and very stiff and at 1.5 inches toHD  wear with dress clothes, but rather than returning for a replacement I will just keep + wear with Jeans, I should have known that for $7.95,  it would be a Chinese product with inconsistent quality,",3608,1
3609,Quality was really bad but that's what you pay for with that price,3609,1

3796,"All three from China, of course O_o
I hate to hate on China, but I gotta this time because I was really looking forward to these dresses.",3796,1
3796,I had each dress on for less than five minutes for me to decide that they weren't going to work.,3796,1
3796,Even though they fit ok - as in not too tight and not too loose.,3796,1
3796,"But the dresses didn't look anything like in the photo, it looked as though my 8th grade self had tried to copy it as a Home Ec sewing project.",3796,1

3805,I ordered a large and extra large since you can't buy separates.,3805,1
3805,Bottoms: large: way too small/tight on rear but fit nicely in front.,3805,1
3805,Extra large: still too tight on rear and baggy in front.,3805,1
3805,Top: the difference between large and extra large is more in the length than the width but unfortunately it's width I need.,3805,1
3805,I normally wear an extra large top but I had MAJOR under-boob or too much showing on top because the material is too narrow.,3805,1

3808,"I'd be embarrassed to give these things as a gift to anyone, I'd be embarrassed to give them to goodwill, and if I keep them a half refund theyd just be taking up space in my dresser drawer.",3808,1

3865,Item was wayyyyyy too small due to bad sizing.,3865,1
3866,Thought t-shirt was 100% cotton instead of polyester,3866,1

3871,I am very upset with the way my dress came out.,3871,1

3871,My measurements were taken but the bust area is still way to big and the waist is too small.,3871,1
3871,I may need to buy a new dress at last minute.,3871,1

3878,We never used them as I was concerned about circulation and the tight elastic.,3878,1
3879,The quality of the case was very poor.,3879,1

4276,"Very cheap, so thin you can see through the towel.",4276,1
4276,Not happy with product.,4276,1
4277,nice material for a short skinny girl im a fit chick 5-4 145 at most and it did not fit nor cover my private areas do not waste your money and the retun was hell and i had to resolve it with amazon who gave me a amazon credit but from lollicouture website.,4277,1
4278,I wore it once before it broke.,4278,1
4279,"The scarf and hat looks very nice online however, once it is received, it has a terrible odor to it.",4279,1
4279,It smells like it has been exposed to dirty water.,4279,1
4279,The odor is hard to get out and I would not recommend this product to anyone else unless you like your clothing to smell.,4279,1
4280,"Loved this vest when I ordered it, ordered a large because every review I read said they ran really small.",4280,1
4280,(Normally I'm a medium) They sent me a men's (?),4280,1
4280,3XL.,4280,1
4280,So now I'm stuck with a vest that I will absolutely never wear.,4280,1
4280,So disappointed!!,4280,1
4280,!,4280,1
4281,This product is a piece of crap!,4281,1
4281,I was debating on even write in a review because I saw it as a waste of time...,4281,1
4281,I recommend you forget about this item and everything to do with this item!,4281,1
4281,It broke within the first 2 or 3 days of being on my key chain!,4281,1
4282,"Arrived fast, beautiful material, fit was a little large but otherwise flowed nicely (I bought one size up after reading reviews).",4282,1
4282,I still loved this dress - until I washed it.,4282,1
4282,"The colors bled onto the white and is now unwearable :(
I don't know if I want to risk buying it again and seeing if I can wash it without the dye coming off... Good luck to those who do try!",4282,1
4282,"It's too bad since it was my new favorite, for like, a day.",4282,1
4283,"Material feels like a crusty, cheap, burlap sack.",4283,1
4283,Tried washing it a few times but that did not help.,4283,1
4283,I never tried it on because  I cringed just thinking about having the material touch my body.,4283,1
4283,If I could give a minus rating I would.,4283,1
4283,How could someone possible wear this shirt?,4283,1
4283,I will probably use it as a rag.,4283,1
4284,This is the first time in three years I've had the wrong item mailed to me from Amazon.,4284,1
4284,"I ordered this item in the jungle pattern, size 4T for my son.",4284,1
4284,I received the girly jelly fish print with ruffle butt in size 12M.,4284,1
4284,"Amazon quickly shipped ""the correct item"", but I received the 12M jellyfish print diaper again.",4284,1
4284,It's a bummer because I was hoping not to purchase disposable swim diapers while my kid it potty training.,4284,1
4284,"Other than this,  the colors of the item I DID receive were nice and bright.",4284,1
4285,I ordered a medium (usually wear a small).,4285,1
4285,The top was HUGE and the bottoms were tiny!,4285,1
4285,Returned.,4285,1
4286,I used the sizing tool and the tank is way too big for me.,4286,1
4287,The size XL will not fit my 8 old daughter.,4287,1
4287,Sizes are tiny.,4287,1
4288,Fabric is extremely light weight and feels cheap.,4288,1
4288,The cover up is very short and couldn't be used for anything over than for a swim suit cover up.,4288,1
4288,Cute style but wouldn't buy unless you don't expect much.,4288,1
4289,Not fit to be worn in public!,4289,1
4289,Waste of money!,4289,1
4289,!,4289,1
4290,Don't waste time or money unless your size 0,4290,1
4291,The shirt drapes beautifully and is true to size including a perfect length.,4291,1
4291,What I find disappointing in women's clothes in the past ten years is the increase use of polyester.,4291,1
4291,"Though the description says chiffon, chiffon is a description of the type of weave.",4291,1
4291,Nylon chiffon replaced silk chiffon in the 1930's.,4291,1
4291,The 1960's saw the immersion of polyester chiffon.,4291,1
4291,"To find an all linen, wool, silk or even cotton top these days, one must look among men's shirts or a high end fashion brand.",4291,1
4291,Polyester is excruciating to wear in Arizona as it does not breath.,4291,1
4291,Will send back and will go back to less purchases but luxury brands.,4291,1
4292,Totally tarnished within just a couple weeks .....not Michael  Kors  that's for sure...I don't even wear  it now,4292,1
4293,Love it but when I went to try it on it was so small....the size isn't what it says.....cut for a very petite person.,4293,1
4293,...,4293,1
4294,Not a true size 3x fits like a 1x,4294,1
4295,Very cheap quality,4295,1
4296,This product was a waste of money and I gladly got a return,4296,1
4297,This dress would be nice if the bottom wasn't sewn sloppy.,4297,1
4297,It doesn't flow at the bottom like the picture.,4297,1
4297,It's really bunchy,4297,1
4298,Bad copy,4298,1
4299,hate this biotch.,4299,1
4299,and really silky but ew gross feeling.,4299,1
4300,"Love the pic, though when I got it, looked cheap and the stone fell out of the necklace right away.",4300,1
4300,"Inexpensive neckloace, though, so you get what you pay for.",4300,1
4301,Poor quality and it just delivered after ordering In October.,4301,1
4301,Stay away.,4301,1
4302,Doesn't even go past my belly button.,4302,1
4302,Terrible.,4302,1
4302,Don't waste your money.,4302,1
4303,Thought I had already reviewed this and the other set I'd ordered.,4303,1
4303,I could not for the life of me get these to stay in place on my ears!,4303,1
4303,Very frustrating.,4303,1
4303,Amazon already picked them up through UPS and my credit should be handled by now or soon.,4303,1
4304,Not quality merchandise.,4304,1
4304,Feel apart on first washing.,4304,1
4305,Waste of money!,4305,1
4305,Don't buy this silly thing that doesn't even stay in place when you wear it.,4305,1
4306,Too small and the material is cheap and not ANYTHING like described,4306,1
4307,I didn't expect it to be cashmere,4307,1
4308,Very cheaply made.,4308,1
4308,Then there's extra fabric hanging around the stomach/waist and chest area towards the arms with nowhere to go!,4308,1
4308,The front black part is longer than the rest of the dress.,4308,1
4308,The back part around the zipper is pulling a bit coz of the way the dress was sawn.,4308,1
4308,Smh.,4308,1
4308,It's a nice looking dress of it someone actually took the time to make it right.,4308,1
4309,"No liner in shorts, lace only",4309,1
4310,"First of all, the anklets were very pretty.",4310,1
4310,I ordered 2 that were slightly different styles and I was excited to wear them.,4310,1
4310,I have to wear a uniform to work and it's super plain but the good news is the bottom of it is a skirt so I was looking forward to having something cute to wear with it.,4310,1
4310,So now the bad news...,4310,1
4310,The anklet randomly broke after being at work for only 2 hours.,4310,1
4310,My co-worker actually found it on the ground and gave it to me.,4310,1
4310,"I'm a cocktail waitress at a resort so I walk around a lot all night, but nothing I do should have caused it to just fall off so quickly.",4310,1
4310,When I got home I was able to take a closer look at it and quickly noticed one of the end pieces where the clasp was had broken off.,4310,1
4310,I probably could have easily had it fixed but the price was so low I figured oh well I'll just wear the other one tomorrow night.,4310,1
4310,So the next night I wore the second one but this time it fell off after about 20 minutes at work.,4310,1
4310,I I looked around and found it pretty quickly in the middle of the floor again  and sure enough  the same exact thing happened!,4310,1
4310,"Two things,  first; the saying you get what you pay for is So true with these anklets.",4310,1
4310,They were very poorly  made.,4310,1
4310,"Secondly, I noticed that the clasp used to hold it together was way too small for the anklet.",4310,1
4310,It actually looked like it was from a necklace or bracelet made for a child.,4310,1
4310,I could see why it probably just pulled apart super easy.,4310,1
4310,So unless you're into buying disposable jewelry I would strongly recommend paying a little bit more for a better quality piece of jewelry.,4310,1
4310,Very disappointing. ',4310,1
4311,Cheap Material,4311,1
4312,Complete junk.,4312,1
4312,Can't use them at all.,4312,1
4312,"The cords come out with the slightest tug, the metal links come apart, there is a sharp wire sticking out that would cut someone if they tried to wear it.",4312,1
4312,I've ordered products from Mandala Crafts before and have always been satisfied.,4312,1
4312,Don't buy these - I can't use even one.,4312,1
4313,Bad quality,4313,1
4314,Come on Amazon!!!,4314,1
4314,Stop putting this stuff on your website.,4314,1
4314,I ordered a size large for my wife.,4314,1
4314,The only women that could wear these are tiny anorexic Asian teenage girls.,4314,1
4314,There are no American women that could possibly fit in these.,4314,1
4315,Shirt itself is ok but arm holes are cut super small and fit my average size 10 year old.,4315,1
4315,(Adult XL-she wears 10/12 in little girls!),4315,1
4316,Shirt was way to small.,4316,1
4316,Very disappointed,4316,1
4317,does not come with the box.,4317,1
4317,not the same as pictured.,4317,1
4318,Buyer beware,4318,1
4319,Poorly made,4319,1
4320,I had to cut the straps to wear it.,4320,1
4320,I only wore it once.,4320,1
4320,Not worth the money.,4320,1
4321,Small and thin material,4321,1
4322,This is by far the worst thing I have ever purchased.,4322,1
4322,The size is completely wrong!,4322,1
4322,Medium fits like an XXS.,4322,1
4322,And see through is an understatement.,4322,1
4322,I can see all the way through the dress while holding it up.,4322,1
4322,Very very cheap quality.,4322,1
4322,Save yourself the time and money and do not buy.,4322,1
4323,I ordered XL the first time.,4323,1
4323,In the pack of 4 each was a different size and all fit like a medium or smaller.,4323,1
4323,"I reordered XXL and again found each to be a different size, two were smaller than the XL from the previous order.",4323,1
4323,The product was well made but the sizing was so random.,4323,1
4323,I returned both orders and will never order from this company again.,4323,1
4324,Horrible!,4324,1
4324,cheap!,4324,1
4324,do not waste your money.,4324,1
4324,looks nothing like the picture.,4324,1
4325,The smell is unbearable!,4325,1
4325,"It arrived with a sachet of air freshener, after I removed the air freshener the wallet just smells horrible.",4325,1
4325,"Since I like the look of the wallet, I decided to wait few days to see if the smell disappears - unfortunately after 3 days in the fresh air the wallet still stinks!",4325,1
4325,Very disappointed.,4325,1
4326,My son wore once on a ski trip and it had snags all over it.,4326,1
4326,:(,4326,1
4327,Came in the mail and was happy when I opened it it was orange not red see thru poor quality size comes very small,4327,1
4328,The top was way too small,4328,1
4329,Fabric is thin.,4329,1
4329,See through.,4329,1
4329,It runs very small a 3x is more like a lg /xl.,4329,1
4329,You can put it on but who wants to look like a popped roll of buscuits?,4329,1
4330,FAKE.,4330,1
4331,Too short,4331,1
4332,I purchased this bag for my international trip and when i opened the package there was an odor.,4332,1
4332,Not even two weeks later the lining started to separate from the bag and the zipper is broke.,4332,1
4332,This was a poorly put together project.,4332,1
4332,I will never purchase from this company again.,4332,1
4333,"I ordered this ""knitted sweater"" for my wife.",4333,1
4333,It looks nothing like the picture and only hangs a few inches below her waist unlike how the picture depicts.,4333,1
4333,The pattern isn't even close and the material is cheap and not sown together very well.,4333,1
4333,"It looks more like material you would use for a sweatshirt, definitely not a knitted sweater.",4333,1
4333,Unfortunately we ordered another one for a friends birthday.,4333,1
4333,Looks like we've wasted our money on these two purchases.,4333,1
4333,I haven't bought many clothes on Amazon and this purchase will make me think twice before buying any clothing on Amazon again.,4333,1
4334,Not happy  at all,4334,1
4335,Not worth the money you spend on them,4335,1
4336,not great quality,4336,1
4337,"Too big, and not gold more like silver....",4337,1
4337,Waste of money!,4337,1
4338,The majority of the reviews seemed okay so I decided to give it a try since it was so cheap anyways.,4338,1
4338,"When I tried putting the earrings on, the metal got bent, but I bent it back and it seemed okay.",4338,1
4338,Don't wear these earrings for too long because they might give you an infection.,4338,1
4338,I wore them for about two months and my right ear started getting an infection.,4338,1
4338,"Two more weeks after that, my left ear also got an infection.",4338,1
4338,I cleaned my piercings and the earrings every day and the infection didn't start to heal until I took them off and switched to real silver earrings.,4338,1
4338,This is the only time I have ever had a problem with fake earrings.,4338,1
4338,"Now my ears are fully recovered, but I will never wear these earrings ever again.",4338,1
4339,Horrible quality .Frayed thread and improperly sewn In multiple areas  .,4339,1
4339,This is a very poorly constructed tank top.,4339,1
4339,Providing pictures of the tank seams that are visible when wearing.,4339,1
4340,CHEAPLY MADE TOTALLY SEE THROUGH,4340,1
4341,Have not recorded item,4341,1
4342,"One of the latches was broken when I got it... a week  later one of my shoulder straps came completely detached, not fixable, and then the big over the shoulder strap is not even usable because the patch is broken on it.",4342,1
4343,It's huge and cheap looking.,4343,1
4344,The dress does NOT look like the picture.,4344,1
4344,The liner underneath did not line up with the split.,4344,1
4344,Liner was too long for the split.......BUT it was NOT attached to the dress all the way to the hem.,4344,1
4344,The liner underneath only reached to ankle level.,4344,1
4344,I gave the dress a try because it was really cute on the picture.,4344,1
4344,Sadly it didn't work.,4344,1
4345,"I am 6'1"" and I need tall clothes, but these pants were at least 4"" too long for me!",4345,1
4345,I returned them..,4345,1
4346,My son was very happy with his watch when he got it.,4346,1
4346,He especially liked the different background colors for the light.,4346,1
4346,"But by the third day of normal wear, the face was fogged up.",4346,1
4346,The condensation got gradually worse until a week later it stopped working all together.,4346,1
4346,I would not recommend this to anyone.,4346,1
4347,The prayer shawl was of very poor quality.,4347,1
4347,When I opened the package the threads at the ends began to shed; falling to the floor.,4347,1
4347,When I opened the shawl the folded creases were dirty!,4347,1
4347,This was a horrible experience and I wouldn't order from this company again.,4347,1
4348,ran way small,4348,1
4349,made for a child.,4349,1
4350,Cheaply made and at least 3 sizes smaller than the marked size.,4350,1
4351,"Almost as secure as the Chrysmela Catch, but much lighter.",4351,1
4351,The Chrysmela Catch is almost impossible for your back to come off (I swim in them) but they are twice the weight.,4351,1
4351,I love these because they are not really heavier than a normal back and I trust my 4 carat diamond studs with these.,4351,1
4351,"I wrote that a year ago, I wore these into an interview with my blue sapphire studs and it was really embarrassing in the middle of the interview the back fell off.",4351,1
4351,"I am sticking with my Chrysmela Catch, twice the price but worth it, and actually the added weight on the back makes my larger studs stand up better in front.",4351,1
4352,piece of garbage.,4352,1
4352,"will somehow turn it into something else, don't know what or how, even the bow was not sewn correctly.",4352,1
4352,I doubt my 20 pound dog could fit into this crap.,4352,1
4352,waste of money.,4352,1
4352,looks nothing like in picture.,4352,1
4352,will probably end up in the trash.,4352,1
4353,"These are size ""medium"" and fit OK, BUT the fly is stitched!",4353,1
4353,"That's right guys, I guess they don't have Johnsons in China.",4353,1
4353,"I also ordered a small version in a different color...and the ""small"" was BIGGER than the ""medium"".",4353,1
4353,crummy quality control.,4353,1
4354,Sizing chart and accuracy,4354,1
4355,This product doesn't work.,4355,1
4355,I bought it for my boyfriend who really needed one and sticks to nothing!,4355,1
4356,Straight garbage.,4356,1
4356,I ordered a size up and they were short and wide.,4356,1
4356,Barely covered my stomach.,4356,1
4356,Paper thin trash.,4356,1
4356,But on a positive i loved the colors.,4356,1
4356,Dont waste your money,4356,1
4357,I had high expectations for this dress and when I got it in the mail it looked beautiful but when I took it out of the packaging the zipper on the back was stuck and I can't fix it so I can't even really wear it.,4357,1
4358,Ordered these for my girlfriend.,4358,1
4358,These are children's size.,4358,1
4359,I don't know what is up with these shorts.,4359,1
4359,"Not sure if these were previously ordered by someone with a ton of cats and dogs and then returned, but i ordered the black and navy blue shorts and both have a ton of fibers/hair on it.",4359,1
4359,"I mean if this was a returned item sent to me, amazon sucked at checking it.",4359,1
4359,Debating returning them unless amazon wants to send me a lint brush.,4359,1
4359,Makes matters worse they are running a tad small.,4359,1
4360,VERY CHEAPLY DONE!,4360,1
4360,!,4360,1
4361,Not true to size and mine didn't even come with a zipper on them or a button hole.,4361,1
4362,Bad.,4362,1
4362,Just plain bad.,4362,1
4363,You get what you paid for.,4363,1
4363,I had to send it back.,4363,1
4363,Flimsy.,4363,1
4363,Looks like it wouldn't hold up for long.,4363,1
4363,I do not recommend this product.,4363,1
4364,Says unisex but was a women's shirt,4364,1
4365,One word.. Cheap,4365,1
4366,"These pjs are poorly made, especially in the feet.",4366,1
4366,The footies are 3-4x too small for the size of the pajama.,4366,1
4366,I ordered my son's size 8 and the foot was way too small so I re-ordered the size 10.,4366,1
4366,The feet again look like they were made for a doll....way too small in the size 10 even for an 8 year old.,4366,1
4366,My son has an average size shoe for an 8 year old...he wars a 2.5 to size 3 shoe...so the issue is not on our side.,4366,1
4366,I can't recommend these pjs.,4366,1
4367,My fault I didn't read that it only comes with one.,4367,1
4367,So when I ordered another bag so I can do both ears at the same time the second bag came with shorter ones!!!!!!!!!!,4367,1
4367,So now I have a long one in and a short one in.,4367,1
4367,You actually can tell!,4367,1
4367,Looks horrendous!!,4367,1
4367,!,4367,1
4368,"Sorry but very cheaply made, thin material, the lining does not cover the entire inside of dress, the seams are sewn crooked.",4368,1
4368,This item looks as if it will fall apart with the very first clean.,4368,1
4368,I do NOT recommend the purchase of this to anyone.,4368,1
4369,It must be a child's xl will never wear it,4369,1

4375,A large should have been quite big on me and it was tight.,4375,1
4376,Cute necklace but the clasp immediately broke and would not close from the moment I tried to put it on.,4376,1
4376,Don't buy this.,4376,1
4377,Not what I expected.,4377,1
4378,I got an XL and it didn't fit at all.,4378,1

4449,"I know it's only $14.99, but I expected it to at least look like the picture.",4449,1
4450,Fits too small and extremely cheap quality,4450,1
4451,Ordered an 18 month size and the top arrived according to the size but the pants where a size 12!,4451,1
4451,Figured I'd wouldn't bother with returning it so I washed them before my baby wore them and it turned some of my clothes pink and the pj set is now a faded color.,4451,1
4451,Very cheap.,4451,1
4452,Broke immediately after putting on,4452,1

4455,"Unfortunately, the reads at the end of the zipper came out after just a month of use, making it useless.",4455,1

4458,Already gave mine to goodwill,4458,1
4459,"Performance:
I was tremendously disappointed with the performance of these lenses.",4459,1
4459,"They are basically just slightly-yellow tinted glass (I did verify that it is polarized, but it was no help).",4459,1
4459,"I was expecting the lenses to help filter glare and allow better detailed visibility during the night (or day) similar to my ski goggles, but that is not what I got.",4459,1
4459,"The glare from the Xenon Halogen Lights was not attenuated - it was just yellow now, not blue; the details of the road were not any better (I cycled the glasses on/off - no difference other than yellow, not yellow); arguably the details were worse as the glass caused some distortion as my eyes swept across the lenses - ultimately I ended up with a bit of headache from wearing them.",4459,1
4459,I would NOT recommend these as they missed the mark on performance completely.,4459,1
4459,"Delivery and Condition of Product:
The packaging for these glasses was impressive and comparable to much higher end products.",4459,1
4459,It comes with a beautiful travel case and glass cleaning wipes.,4459,1
4459,The glasses themselves are covered up in plastic protection pieces to indicate they are handled with care.,4459,1
4459,"My glasses had fingerprints on the lenses, but they cleaned up quickly (I didn't run them through AFIS).",4459,1
4459,All other aspects of the glasses were in good shape.,4459,1
4459,"Design:
The physical design of the glasses is great.",4459,1
4459,"Fairly rugged design, feels solid.",4459,1
4459,They look cool and fit my face well.,4459,1
4460,"Super poorly made, DO NOT BUY.",4460,1
4460,"Entire hand assembly shifts when setting time, not accurate.",4460,1

4467,I will be returning this item.,4467,1
4467,The quality and color are not as I would have anticipated.,4467,1
4467,The color isn't as shown in the picture but much later to the point that the 'leather' looks like plastic.,4467,1
4468,Never in my life again.,4468,1
4468,It didn't look anything like this.,4468,1
4469,Fake,4469,1
4470,Mini shirt,4470,1
4471,I got a totally different bag,4471,1
4472,so cheap basically plastic but great for Halloween costumes,4472,1
4473,The bar was beyond too small to fit through a septum.,4473,1
4473,The gauge was accurate but the bar was so short it didn't even fit through my nose.,4473,1
4473,Returning ASAP.,4473,1
4474,The picture makes it look like it's a cardigan sweater but it's a t-shirt.,4474,1
4474,"Also, it's very short and it's a little small.",4474,1
4474,I want to love it but I just can't.,4474,1
4474,"If it looked and fit like the picture, I would've.",4474,1
4475,"Sent it back, because it wouldn't fit a midget",4475,1
4476,I ordered an XXL.,4476,1
4476,"It does not fit like a bathing suit cover up, but rather a blouse.",4476,1
4476,"but, it was made in China, so maybe for Chinese woman it is an XXL.",4476,1
4476,I will give it to my niece.,4476,1
4476,"It's not worth sending back for 10.00

I rated one star because it didn't fit, but if it fit...I would rate it a five",4476,1
4477,"Poor quality,  pants broke while I was wearing them.",4477,1
4477,Very disappointed!,4477,1
4478,Very poorly made.,4478,1
4478,No attention to detail.,4478,1
4478,I get that the cheap price so I guess you should get a cheaply made dress.,4478,1
4479,Knitting is loose and falling apart.,4479,1
4479,Do NOT BUY,4479,1
4480,Received the complete wrong product.,4480,1

4484,One fits slightly longer than the other.,4484,1
4485,out of proportion to the average head,4485,1

4486,Definitely not the same as the picture.,4486,1
4486,The colors are way off.,4486,1
4486,Picture shows red flowers.,4486,1
4486,What I received had orange flowers and the beige looked more like a dull light olive green color.,4486,1
4486,A little disappointed to say the least.,4486,1
4487,The bill is terribly long and looks awkward.,4487,1
4487,The color and stitching is nice however....,4487,1

4492,This dress is horrible...I'm so sad..my sister and I both tried it on (we have very different body shapes she is more curvy) and it has way too much fabric in the front.,4492,1

4502,"In the first package, I received 9 pairs of gloves, not 12!",4502,1
4502,"Three brown, four gray, and two burgundy.",4502,1

4508,Most xl' are big on me.,4508,1
4508,Not the case with this shirt.,4508,1
4509,This case was complete garbage and a waste of money.,4509,1
4509,"Minutes after putting it on my phone the little piece that goes over the home button came off, it was hard to txt with the case on and just in general a cheap case...",4509,1
4509,I would not recommend this case to anyone....,4509,1
4510,I ended up returning this shirt.,4510,1

4515,"I put in my 2 ID's, a fuel card, Costco card, 2 credit cards a Menards card and $6.00 in cash in this and it wouldn't stay closed.",4515,1
4515,Big waste of money.,4515,1

4516,"Regular rain boots, not warm at all.",4516,1
4517,I feel as if I was taken advantage of.,4517,1
4517,I purchased three of these suits in different patterns and measured as instructed.,4517,1
4517,I read all the comments and believed these bathing suits were worth paying for.,4517,1
4517,"The top was too small and the material is laughable, as in my husband laughed when i tried on the bikini and showed him the photo online.",4517,1
4517,Did I mention that the pattern and coloring didn't match the photo?,4517,1
4517,I suggest you save your money as this is not worth it.,4517,1
4517,You will wait for weeks for it to be delivered and will be severely disappointed.,4517,1

4533,This item looks like something your mother would make you when you dressed up as a child.,4533,1
4533,It is not even trying to be even (asymmetric)- but instead of that being an awesome quirk to it- it just looks and feels very cheap.,4533,1
4533,"The front part where the white is showing, is barely big enough to show any white, so it looks like you are wearing a halloween costume made from cheap fabric.",4533,1
4533,I would never buy this again and I can't even give it away because everyone that sees it thinks it looks horrible.,4533,1
4533,Oh well.,4533,1

4565,"Ordered an XL, the shirt I received was tight on a friend who normally wears XS.",4565,1
4565,"The fabric is very cheap and flimsy, one snag and it would tear and the length depicted is very wrong, this shirt would be perfect for a tiny woman looking for a flimsy crop top, if you are looking for a nice, quality shirt that fits you, you would be best to order from a completely different store.",4565,1
4566,This would be great if it fit at all...,4566,1

4589,Cheap and large.,4589,1
4589,Gaudy,4589,1

4591,Just got the product today.,4591,1
4591,And had I known that this B.S.,4591,1

4595,Don't waste your money I ordered an extra large and this is what I got very thin and see-through,4595,1
4596,this shirt is incredibly short and short wasted.,4596,1
4596,"I bought an XL, and it looks child size, or maybe an adult X-small.",4596,1
4597,"For reference, I'm 5'2 115 lbs.",4597,1
4597,I purchased a small in the color black.,4597,1
4597,"This dress came in fairly quickly, well before my expected arrival.",4597,1

4597,"Not only that, but its super see through.",4597,1
4597,Also the coloring is a little different than pictured.,4597,1
4597,"And on top of all that, it's very short.",4597,1
4597,I'm probably just going to end up using this as a bathing suit cover up.,4597,1
4597,Not worth the money.,4597,1
4597,I wouldn't recommend this dress at all.,4597,1
4598,Beautiful but the second day the blue heart came off while I was eating and I choked on it pretty hard.,4598,1

4598,Poor quality,4598,1
4599,Started to turn my finger green,4599,1
4600,The material is flimsy and see through and this is very small.,4600,1

4602,So this is a big problem for me.,4602,1

4602,THIS IS FALSE.,4602,1
4602,Pima Cotton is a high quality cotton.,4602,1
4602,Microfiber is polyester.,4602,1
4602,There's no connection between the two.,4602,1
4602,This company is either falsely advertising... Or they're just uneducated on their products.,4602,1
4602,"Either way, they're selling something that's false.",4602,1
4602,"So, if you're expecting any amount of cotton in this underwear... DON'T BUY THEM.",4602,1
4603,I did not get my belt instead I got therapy putty.,4603,1
4604,"This is a beautiful jewelry set, however the packaging it came in smellled very moldy.",4604,1

4605,Felt more like a medium size.,4605,1
4606,I am sorry I have to rate as a one star.,4606,1
4606,The shorts came with a hole in the seat.,4606,1
4606,Not even worth my time to send them back.,4606,1
4607,I wore it once for 3 hours ... and when I got home to change the bolt was gone .. it fell off!!!,4607,1

4780,It like two pieces of curtains sewn together,4780,1
4781,"I bought this product 2 years ago, it lasted
until a month ago.",4781,1
4781,I then re-ordered and the new one lasted 2 weeks.,4781,1
4781,"I was happy
With the first one, but the second one didn't meet expectations.",4781,1
4782,"The top was huge and the bottom was too small, the fabric quality is subpar",4782,1
4783,Cheap material,4783,1
4784,Cheap and not anything like the pic!,4784,1
4785,"I love this dress, its absolutely beautiful.",4785,1
4785,I wish I could wear it.,4785,1
4785,"When I purchase a size 12, thats what I expect.",4785,1
4785,"Unfortunately, it fits like a size 8.",4785,1
4785,"I'm a little frustrated, I had an earlier delivery from Amazon, a dress, and it was too big.",4785,1
4786,"cheap fabric smaller than appeared, and when you tie the back it does not show any of your skin",4786,1
4787,This one turned out to be the worst ever online purchase!,4787,1
4787,"Too small,for the little kid so I gave it as a gift to one...",4787,1
4788,great looking but was defective right out of the box,4788,1
4789,This was so small I gave it to my ten year old niece.,4789,1
4789,It was the laugh of the evening.,4789,1
4789,Horribly tiny.,4789,1
4790,broke as soon as she put it on make cheap....,4790,1
4791,to start off this is not a bad quality bathing suit like some of the other China clothes.,4791,1
4791,"Pretty average but the color is different than the picture, it has a very ugly brown shade mixed in.",4791,1
4791,The part that concerned me is as I took it out I noticed a extremely disgusting stain on the bikini strap I do not know what it is but I looks like feces or boogers or soemthing gross.,4791,1
4791,"It was also very small, I requested a return but I would rather just be sent a new one without stains or just my money back but now I'm going to have to go through the process of returning",4791,1
4792,"This top is very, very, very sheer.",4792,1
4792,"Even with a cami, you can see right through the shirt.",4792,1
4792,Very disappointed with the quality.,4792,1
4793,"quality material, sewn well but dress lacks structure, has a zip back and very large.",4793,1
4793,Had to reorder the women's small/2 and that fits relatively well with the tie back.,4793,1
4793,I would say closer to a girls 16/plus.,4793,1
4794,I gave this dress to a 10 year old and it fit her,4794,1
4795,The fit is really awkward.,4795,1
4795,The top piece is short and not fully attached so it looks more like a cape than the cute flowing top in the picture.,4795,1
4796,Much too small my 10 year old niece could not fit into it.,4796,1
4797,"very, very poor quality fabric, didn't expect much for the price but was very disappointed.",4797,1
4797,"pink is not the same shade as in the photo, lace is not as wide",4797,1
4798,I like the jumpsuit but I didn't know they ran small,4798,1
4799,"Print is way off from the pictures, bright blue background and the deathly hallows print looks like arrows bc of bad color balance.",4799,1
4799,The leggings are comfortable and fit up to an 8/10 but are baggy around the ankles.,4799,1
4799,Would not recommend,4799,1
4800,This charm doesn't look like the picture of it.,4800,1
4801,Tiny,4801,1
4802,This shirt is too short and small.,4802,1
4802,I ordered an XL and it fits as a small.,4802,1
4803,It would have been nice to know that the sizes are based on Asian standards.,4803,1
4803,My 2XL is more like a medium.,4803,1
4803,"Cute, but obviously cheaply made.",4803,1
4803,I doubt this would survive one washing regardless if you used the gentle cycle or hand washing.,4803,1
4803,"Because of the low price and hassle of overseas returns, I'm not even going to worry about it.",4803,1
4804,the material was cheap,4804,1
4805,The letters fell off the next day.,4805,1
4806,The panniers kept collapsing under my skirts.,4806,1
4807,has turned already,4807,1
4808,I ordered a 3X and actually wear a 1X.,4808,1
4808,I ordered this specifically to be a bit on the large side.,4808,1
4808,Shame on me for not trying it on before I washed it.,4808,1
4808,"I did however, use cold water and air dry.",4808,1
4808,I attempted to wear this shortly after and I could not even get my arm in the sleeve it was that small.,4808,1
4808,"I'm very disappointed in this purchase but as I washed it, I cannot return it.",4808,1
4809,Very cheaply made.,4809,1
4810,I would give this 0 stars if it was possible.,4810,1
4810,"I am normally a size medium in tops, I ordered this in an XL thinking it would be big and comfy when it's the exact opposite.",4810,1
4810,It's extremely small and I feel like this has to be mislabeled or a child's size.,4810,1
4810,I am completely disappointed as I was really looking forward to wearing this,4810,1
4811,"material is not chiffon, very cheap material, poor quality,",4811,1
4812,Just don't like the company.,4812,1
4812,Needs some work.,4812,1
4812,"Order your dresses at least two-three sizes larger then what you actually wear, sizes are not true at all.",4812,1
4813,Picture is very misleading.,4813,1
4813,"They show a shawl, I received a cheap bandana.",4813,1
4813,it's printed with white plastic flowers,4813,1
4814,BOOOOOOOOOOO,4814,1
4815,beautiful but you have to be a kid to wear it.,4815,1
4816,No good material this is very bad cuality,4816,1
4817,This is not a good product for people with med/large breasts.,4817,1
4817,The dickey cuts off right in the breast area and makes them look smashed.,4817,1
4817,It's also uncomfortable and will flip up over the breasts leaving it look bunched at the top.,4817,1
4818,The lenses i ordered fit perfectly.,4818,1
4818,But on the left part of the lense it is distorted to look through.,4818,1
4818,It makes everything wavy right in the line of sight.,4818,1
4818,Won't be ordering these again!,4818,1
4819,Do not buy!,4819,1
4819,Complete waste of money.,4819,1
4819,I purchased a medium set.,4819,1
4819,"After waiting over a month for it to arrive: The top was soooo small it looked as if it was sized for a child, the bottoms fit like a woman's extra large.",4819,1
4819,"....While the material quality was ok, the sizing was so off could not wear either piece separately.",4819,1
4819,...So I threw this straight into the Goodwill donation bag.,4819,1
4820,Pretty skimpy,4820,1
4821,Very cheap.,4821,1
4821,Worn one time and they corroded.,4821,1
4821,Not worth the money.,4821,1
4821,Wal-Mart earrings would have likely lasted longer.,4821,1
4821,Not pleased at all.,4821,1
4822,I didn't like themateria at all.,4822,1
4822,It didn't 'hug' my frame as well as other maternity dresses.,4822,1
4822,I pretty much compare everything to Patty Boutique.,4822,1
4822,I sent this item back.,4822,1
4823,Made very cheap and after making this purchase my cc numbers were stolen... not positive it was then but it was my only purchase before it was stolen,4823,1
4824,Very very small size chart is wrong,4824,1
4825,Looks like imported sweaters are not sized for an American women.,4825,1
4826,cheap and WAY to BIG!,4826,1
4827,"The material looked dirty, it was too large in the bust but the neck tie was way too small.",4827,1
4827,In the photo it shows the high neck peice to be laying across the chest... but in person it is not flattering or cute at all.,4827,1
4827,It bunches up in the middle and does not spread across.,4827,1
4828,Was much smaller than shown on chart and the material was extremely thin.was not well made at all.,4828,1
4829,Very dissatisfied.,4829,1
4829,Running EXTREMELY small.,4829,1
4830,This is a horrible item.,4830,1
4830,"It was way to big, I ordered according to the size charge and you could fit three of me it in.",4830,1
4830,Plus it is very very see through.,4830,1
4830,I could probably wear it as a dress if I wanted everyone and there brother to know what type of panties I had on.,4830,1
4830,"It's a waste to try and get a refund because you have to pay shipping, which is probably more than the item cost to begin with.",4830,1
4830,BEWARE PEOPLE...,4830,1
4830,This garment is crap.,4830,1
4831,"This a shirt not a dress, didn't even cover my crotch and has a huge chest area.",4831,1
4831,don't waste your money.,4831,1
4832,The shirt was way too small even though it was marked large; in addition it was missing a button on the cuff of the sleeve.,4832,1
4832,"Pretty and nice material, however, very disappointed with this product.",4832,1
4833,Really want my money back was not what I expected,4833,1
4834,Sized very small.,4834,1
4834,I ordered a women's medium just to be on the safe side.,4834,1
4834,I normally wear a women's small.,4834,1
4834,I couldn't even button this shirt.,4834,1
4834,"I gave it to my 10 year old daughter, who isn't very big, and she could wear it.",4834,1
4835,It was nothing like in the picture it's very cheaply made and I have not worn it yet.,4835,1
4835,It's a 2x and I'm a size 14 it is very small.,4835,1
4835,I think the company should tell the consumers that there products runs small.,4835,1
4836,Poor quality and cheaply made,4836,1
4837,This ring was very cheap looking and not pretty at all.,4837,1
4837,It took forever to get here and I was highly disappointed.,4837,1
4838,Horrible stitching..,4838,1
4839,Not very flattering.,4839,1
4839,Followed the advice and ordered a size large.,4839,1
4839,I usually wear a small or medium.,4839,1
4839,Way too big.,4839,1
4839,No return info was included so I'm stuck with them.,4839,1
4839,Will go to good will.,4839,1
4840,Love(d) this swimsuit.,4840,1
4840,The fit was great and accommodated my large chest.,4840,1
4840,The only disappointment is that there is a small hole in the back where the lower half (the skirt/bottom) is stitched to the top half.,4840,1
4840,"It is not a tear, but a small part where the stitching didn't catch the fabric.",4840,1
4840,"(All threads are intact, no loose fraying of the fabric or broken threads.)",4840,1
4840,"Much to my dismay, this was not noticed until I had put the suit on and was being sprayed with sunblock on the beach.",4840,1
4840,VERY disappointed that I will not be able to wear this suit thru the summer as expected.,4840,1
4840,"And since I ""wore"" it, I can't return it.",4840,1
4840,"because of the sense of wasted money, this is a mixed review.",4840,1
4840,"The color and fit of the suit, I LOVE IT.",4840,1
4840,"The fact that i wasted my money on a faulty item, I HATE IT.",4840,1
4840,I will only give 1 star as wasting money truly upsets me.,4840,1
4841,The pieces that you plug in don't stay in.,4841,1
4841,They fall out all the time.,4841,1
4841,The connection where the two arms come together is poor quality.,4841,1
4841,The long handle came off right away.,4841,1
4841,"I fixed it, but within a week it came apart again and now one of the pins that holds it together has gone missing, so I cannot fix it.",4841,1
4841,The metal is too flimsy.,4841,1
4842,Dumb.,4842,1
4842,Fell for the hype and bought in a moment of feeling fat.,4842,1
4842,Will save for Halloween costume I guess........,4842,1
4843,This hat is youth size.,4843,1
4843,It's way too small for me so I'm giving it to my 8 year old son.,4843,1
4843,I don't even know if it will fit him.,4843,1
4844,I ordered 2 sizes larger and it was TOO SMALL!,4844,1
4845,This outfit was to small,4845,1
4846,The shirt had a hole in it!!!,4846,1
4846,It was burnt!,4846,1
4846,!,4846,1
4847,Screen print came off after first wash,4847,1
4848,It's super cute!,4848,1
4848,Wish it would fit me.,4848,1
4848,But it runs super small I'm usually a medium but I don't think even an XL would fit,4848,1
4849,"XL fits like a S, I'm a M/L and went an extra size up per the comments.",4849,1
4849,My 3 year old just gained a play dress.,4849,1
4849,:(,4849,1
4850,Nice color - but these are definitely not made for the average lady / woman...,4850,1
4850,They are absolutely huge and I looked as if I had clown hands when I wore them.,4850,1
4850,They are even too big for my husband.,4850,1
4851,Itchy material.,4851,1
4851,Looks cheap.,4851,1
4851,Going to goodwill.,4851,1
4852,Looks like a chihuahua and it doesn't fit small ears very well..,4852,1
4853,see through and cheap material.,4853,1
4854,Absolute crap.,4854,1
4854,Plastic and poorly made.,4854,1
4854,Arrived broken to hell and back.,4854,1
4854,See photo.,4854,1
4855,"I was so excited to get this when it came in the mail, it shipped really fast!",4855,1
4855,When I pulled it out I was somewhat disappointed with the fabric.,4855,1
4855,I was expecting something loose and draping.,4855,1
4855,"It was really stretchy, almost spandexy fabric that looked like it was gonna cling to my body instead of hang off of it.",4855,1
4855,"I got the largest size possible, I think the XXXL, but when I tried it on it clung tightly to my skin.",4855,1
4855,I realized how thin the fabric was when it couldn't cover my DD's.,4855,1
4855,"I know I have somewhat largish boobs, that's why I got such a huge size, but the fabric was so thin and stretched so tight that you could see right through to my bra.",4855,1
4855,The draping that I expected was nonexistent once I put it on.,4855,1
4855,It looked like I had two weird inside out pockets right on my thighs.,4855,1
4855,Not flattering and not what I paid for.,4855,1
4855,I figured I might as well keep it as loungewear or something since I didn't want the hassle of trying to return it.,4855,1
4855,That was a mistake on my part.,4855,1
4855,Once I washed it a couple times (it smelled of plastic from shipping and the black was running a bit) I wore it around the house for a day.,4855,1
4855,Had to take it off because the strap broke.,4855,1
4855,Once I took it off I realized that it had dyed a large portion of my body light grey and purple.,4855,1
4855,My bra and underwear were stained black wherever they made contact with it.,4855,1
4855,My armpits were black and purple.,4855,1
4855,"Bear in mind, I had already washed this.",4855,1
4855,Why should the color bleed that much after at least two washes?,4855,1
4855,It shouldn't.,4855,1
4855,I got a cheap imitation of what they show on the model.,4855,1
4855,"Don't waste your money, go to a store where you can try it on.",4855,1
4855,Buyer beware.,4855,1
4855,This whole experience has left a sour taste in my mouth,4855,1
4856,Very disappointed.,4856,1
4856,The color advertised looks like a light blue long sleeve shirt with the red elephant.,4856,1
4856,"Infact when u do a close up-it infact appears light blue with a district whit e
Elephant tooth.",4856,1
4856,When it arrived the shirt is white not light blue.,4856,1
4856,The tooth is as white as the shirt.,4856,1
4856,Beware ....,4856,1
4856,Very misleading and disappointing!,4856,1
4856,The color does say white on the advertisement but ithe picture is not white and we didn't notice the color was printed as white.,4856,1
4856,We simply saw the color....,4856,1
4856,Looked great and bought it.,4856,1
4856,Now I know better.... Should have read the color:(.,4856,1
4856,Sure would have liked a blue t-shirt!,4856,1
4857,Came broken.,4857,1
4858,Way to small for the boob area,4858,1
4859,"Cheap material, not flattering",4859,1
4860,I loved this when i got it but the clasp broke first time I put it on.,4860,1
4861,I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs.,4861,1
4861,It's a one piece with footies.,4861,1
4861,It does not stretch at all.,4861,1
4861,Nice picture to look at online though,4861,1
4862,I ordered a large even though I generally wear a medium.,4862,1
4862,I could not even get the shirt on it is so small.,4862,1
4862,It was not enough money for me to be willing to pay to ship it back.,4862,1
4863,Broke after a few days,4863,1
4864,I requested a return and was refunded - which was nice.,4864,1
4864,The hat is seriously too large.,4864,1
4864,And the bill looks really awkward.,4864,1
4865,Even larger size it's too small!,4865,1
4865,Waste of money.,4865,1
4866,"cheap flat lenses,not worth a cent, look like a fool wearing them.",4866,1
4867,"First, these dresses are dry clean only.",4867,1
4867,"Second, they're lined with a stain around the bust which makes it ride up.",4867,1
4867,The zippers are the worst though.,4867,1
4867,I bought five of these and three of the five have busted zippers.,4867,1
4867,The zippers that don't break will become unstitched at the waist.,4867,1
4868,very very very small and im a petite person only 100 lbs soaking wet and i cant even get one leg in,4868,1
4869,I wear US 16 and 5X is too tight.,4869,1
4869,The sleeves are too short.,4869,1
4869,They are not elbow length as pictures.,4869,1
4869,This top is not cut as it is portrayed in the photo.,4869,1
4870,I was sadly disappointed with this product not what i expected.,4870,1
4870,"Was not a ""waist trainer"" was just a material stomach girdle.",4870,1
4870,Wish i could return huge waste of money,4870,1
4871,Looks nothing like the picture.,4871,1
4871,Dress is way too small and very flimsy!!,4871,1
4871,Actually looks like a night gown.,4871,1
4872,It's ugly and cheap!,4872,1
4873,Kind of boring not really that cute sorry.,4873,1
4873,Material was fine and fit as expected but not very flattering,4873,1
4874,Not what I exspected,4874,1
4875,Way way to small.,4875,1
4875,I orders a 5x and its like a medium.,4875,1
4876,"Very bad quality, I've had them for 2 months and one of the purses is falling apart, the other the zippers don't work,  I don't even believe these are real lily bloom purses with their crappy quality,  waste of money.",4876,1
4876,Don't order these.,4876,1
4877,Horrible horrible horrible don't buy doesn't fit at all and buyers give hard time for a refund,4877,1
4878,This shirt unfortunately is way too small!!!,4878,1
4878,It says it's a large...but yeah for a dog tshirt.,4878,1
4878,Sorry :( I love Prince but the size of the shirt was very disappointing,4878,1
4879,Worse buy ever!,4879,1
4880,Bad material  will not buy again doesn't fit rite not spandex,4880,1
4881,"This ""dress"" is really a shirt.",4881,1
4881,"I'm 5'5"" and it barely covered the lady bits!",4881,1
4881,I was very disappointed as the fabric was soft and stretchy and would have been a perfect summer dress.,4881,1
4881,There is NO way I could wear this.,4881,1
4881,NOPE!,4881,1
4882,looks like it has potential but it was too small,4882,1
4883,Looks cheap,4883,1
4884,This broke not after five minutes of wear.,4884,1
4884,Not worth it.,4884,1
4885,Was completely  see through and made from very cheap material.,4885,1
4885,I ended up throwing it out.,4885,1
4886,"I received this two days ago, before I even opened the box that it came in, I smelled something funny.",4886,1
4886,"When I pulled it out of the plastic, I realized it was actually the passport holder that  smelled so horrible.",4886,1
4886,"I don't know how they treated this product, but it smells absolutely horrible.",4886,1
4886,And this tiny passport holder makes an entire room smell like it.,4886,1
4886,"I am leaving it out, hoping that it will somehow air out or dissipate before Christmas.",4886,1
4886,"It is a gift, and I would never want to give this to someone smelling like this.",4886,1
4887,Product knockoff.,4887,1
4887,Poor quality.,4887,1
4888,"I've bought these before, however this time I received a pair with totally different material than the last.",4888,1
4888,This time I bought a large and received a pair that was like an extra small.,4888,1

4889,Too large.,4889,1
4889,Not a small at all,4889,1
4890,Can't insert in shoes.,4890,1
4890,Too large,4890,1
4891,I've never had a captive bead this hard to close.,4891,1
4891,There is usually ribbed ends or something to help the bead slide in.,4891,1
4891,And I lost the bead within the first day.,4891,1
4892,"This product runs very, very small.",4892,1
4893,This runs very small.,4893,1
4893,It doesnt fit at all.,4893,1
4893,So I decided to use it as a PJ shirt.,4893,1
4893,Went through the laundry once and shrunk even smaller!,4893,1
4894,The photo does not match what you actually receive!,4894,1
4894,"First off, it smells really weird.",4894,1
4894,"The fur is NOT a nice cream color, it is brown and black and looks matted down and is falling out.",4894,1
4894,Also the picture shows a solid black zipper but it is actually grey and black?,4894,1
4894,It also arrived broken!,4894,1
4894,I also have 2 random buttons on the side which are also not shown in the photo.,4894,1
4894,I am asking for a refund.,4894,1
4894,I waited 3 weeks for it to arrive and I am soooo disappointed.,4894,1
4894,Do not buy this!,4894,1
4895,Tried these on out of the box and they fit perfect.,4895,1
4895,I really liked that they felt like the Breathable Bamboo Fiber Boxer Briefs with no fly and that the legs were a bit longer.,4895,1
4895,"I noticed that the waist was a little higher and I preferred the low rise waist of the briefs with no fly, but this was not a game changer.",4895,1
4895,"Also, I would have liked that these come in black but could not find them in that color.",4895,1
4895,After a single wash I noticed they shrunk but the waist band still felt comfortable enough to wear.,4895,1
4895,After a full days use I couldn't wait to pull these off.,4895,1
4895,"Unlike the Bamboo briefs with no fly, these have a seam right down the back side.",4895,1
4895,Guess where that seam decided to wedge itself all day long!!!,4895,1
4895,"Don't know that i can return these, so they are now my, ""last resort, all out of other briefs,"" briefs.",4895,1
4895,LoL,4895,1
4896,Cute for a few hours changed colors the same day I got them.,4896,1

4980,I thought I'd give them another shot but would not purchase again.,4980,1
4980,"One hole is in the top seam of the pocket, and I don't carry around items in these pockets nor do I keep my hands in them.",4980,1

4986,There is no way this was a true 2X.,4986,1
4987,I really wanted to like this swim suit because it has the sexiness of a two-piece and provides tummy coverage.,4987,1
4987,But it just made me look like I have no waist since the crochet area is too loose - I'm 5'4 and 125lbs.,4987,1
4987,"The material felt scratchy and the straps did not stay hooked (I tried them in different positions - tank top, halter, and criss-cross).",4987,1

4992,Was sewn poorly the front was too small from the back,4992,1
4993,When I purchased the shirt it said for youth...I look on amazons sizing and nothing was mentioned about the correct sizing so I had to guess as which category it fell into.,4993,1
4993,It was sized for kids ages 8-16 and I was thinking it was for kids younger.,4993,1
4993,My mistake I won't repeat or purchase twice,4993,1

5020,Flimsy and cheap.,5020,1
5020,Really big too.,5020,1
5020,Don't know how you get anything over it to hide it (wig or hat).,5020,1
5020,Spend the money and get something of better quality.,5020,1
5021,Sizes run very small.,5021,1
5021,Was very dissappointed.,5021,1
5022,The skirt is way too long And the waist is way too small...,5022,1
5022,Waste of my money.,5022,1
5023,Necklace is larger than it appeared and it isn't traditional cameo.,5023,1
5024,Product is too small.,5024,1
5024,The sizes are not like posted.,5024,1
5024,I was not given enough time to return this product.,5024,1
5025,TOO BIG,5025,1
5026,I had ordered these way before Christmas and had to have them resent due to being lost and then the second delivery was delayed trying to talk to someone was like pulling teeth and were not willing to compromise to help me.,5026,1
5026,Very disappointed,5026,1
5027,This shirt looks totally adorable on the model but NOTHING like the picture when it arrives.,5027,1
5027,"The fabric is a cheap, loose spandex.",5027,1
5027,Similar to what high school flag twirlers wear is how I would describe it.,5027,1
5027,Threading was coming undone and hanging off it.,5027,1
5027,Shirt arrived in packaging; however there was dirt all over the front like it was dropped on the floor and then packaged up for shipping.,5027,1
5027,The fit of the shirt is also extremely unflattering.,5027,1
5027,"It clings to your body, accentuating places you don't want it to (like your stomach).",5027,1
5027,I will be returning this immediately.,5027,1
5028,I ordered this shirt.,5028,1
5028,I is cute it is very thin and is not true to size.,5028,1
5029,Received item after about a month and a half.,5029,1
5029,"Correction, I received a pair of truly awkward multi colored leg warmers.",5029,1
5029,"I'm not sure what happened, but I feel like I put 10 dollars in a paper shredder.",5029,1
5029,"It might help of they were at least cute, but unfortunately they have no redeeming qualities and I still need a pair of fishnet socks.",5029,1
5030,Love the look of the belly button ring.,5030,1
5030,"BUT, the ball that screws on was stripped.",5030,1
5030,It would constantly turn and never get tight.,5030,1
5030,I tried pulling on it when I put it in last night (4/26/16) and it didn't come off so I thought it'd be ok to wear and that maybe it just turns like that.,5030,1
5030,"Well, I was wrong.",5030,1
5030,Ring fell out while working and is now lost.,5030,1
5030,I'm highly disappointed.,5030,1
5030,Nothing I hate more then wasting money.,5030,1
5030,And the product took forever to be delivered.,5030,1
5031,Inseam ripped as soon as I put them on.,5031,1
5031,"They are fitted as they are intended to be, but not rip the seam tight!",5031,1
5031,"Also, sleeves of shirt are short on me, I'm only 5'2 & ordered a medium.",5031,1
5032,Do not waste your money on this.,5032,1
5032,I realize this will be inside of my purse but what is the point of a brand new item if it comes scratched??,5032,1
5032,These people are ripping Buyers off.,5032,1
5032,They probably use leftover plastic from who knows where and mark it up as $20 to sell it.,5032,1
5032,"Also, if you don't like rattling noises in your purse, don't buy this as it makes so much noise inside with all the stuff rubbing on the plastic.",5032,1
5032,I will buy some fabric and sew a liner for this as the noise really drives me crazy.,5032,1
5033,Not a real no show sock.,5033,1
5033,See pics.,5033,1
5033,Quality is fine but not so soft.,5033,1
5033,I would prefer buying a softer sock.,5033,1
5034,Runs extremely small,5034,1
5035,Do not buy anything from this company cheap print cheap hoodie and wayyyyyy overpriced.,5035,1
5036,"This is the most poorly made, awkward fitting thing I've purchased in a LONG time.",5036,1
5036,The straps are so long that it would t cover my boons and I'm not a small chested woman.,5036,1
5036,"Cheap, and terrible.",5036,1
5036,So disappointed!,5036,1
5037,I am right on the edge of misses/plus sizes.,5037,1
5037,I can wear everything from a large to a 1x depending on the cut of the shirt.,5037,1
5037,I ordered the 5xl and it is just too small.,5037,1
5037,I skip this if you ever wear anything bigger than a large.,5037,1
5037,"Also, the ""ruby"" color is rust.",5037,1
5038,"I didn't like them, they look very cheap to me sorry.",5038,1
5039,The length of it is about 6 inches so the picture is very misleading on here.,5039,1
5039,Under the bust it goes just a little past halfway to the belly button,5039,1
5040,After about 2 months of daily use the strap broke.,5040,1
5040,I kept  MacBook Air in it which apparently is too heavy.,5040,1
5040,Everything I needed fit in this tote but the step is not practical for how much bulk you can fit into it.,5040,1
5040,The thin strap simply will not support the weight.,5040,1
5041,Yuck.,5041,1
5041,Terrible fabric.,5041,1

5045,I'm very disappointed with my package.,5045,1
5046,They do not kept your feet warm,5046,1
5047,All that this is is a large piece of square t-shirt fabric.,5047,1
5047,"The ""fringes"" are cut into the material at 2 ends.",5047,1
5047,So there are only fringes on the front of one arm.,5047,1
5047,And the back of the other arm.,5047,1
5047,The seams at the bottom of the arms where there aren't any fringes is just cut material.,5047,1
5047,They didn't even bother to sew up the seams.,5047,1
5047,Only the neck is sewn up.,5047,1
5047,This looks cheap as all get out.,5047,1

5049,Shoes are white and came dirty and worn out not even the original box and was really cheap,5049,1
5050,Had to give it to my 12 year old...I'm 5-1 and 148 lbs and it wouldn't come past my stomach and I ordered an XL,5050,1

5053,I cannot wear them over my eyeglasses and the lenses are smaller than my eyeglasses,5053,1
5054,The Hat was way too small even for the description that it has.,5054,1
5054,It fits like a small boys hat which also is not mentioned in the description.,5054,1
5055,"My first thought was that these are chinzy pieces of ****, but I told myself to give them a chance because I know I'm a little prejudiced against fake jean leggings....",5055,1
5055,Guess what?,5055,1
5055,First assertion correct.,5055,1
5055,I put these puppies on and they were a little too stretched out but still wearable.,5055,1
5055,Had nice length and were comfortable.,5055,1
5055,THANK GOODNESS I looked at my ass in the mirror!,5055,1

5058,"Some of this came off, but not all.",5058,1
5058,"Ruined one of my favorite ties, which was far more expensive than this tie bar.",5058,1
5058,"Don't buy this, unless you hate your ties, or love black rub marks on your ties.",5058,1

5064,"Really cute and nicely made, but way too small.",5064,1

5069,"The size is absolutely a lie , There needs to be other sizes not everyone is a freaking Barbie .",5069,1
5069,Plus once I could squeeze into it I couldn't breathe had an even harder time taking it off .,5069,1
5069,Very upset will not be buying this ever again .,5069,1
5069,Everybody has a different shape so therefore when a product says one size fits all is absurd .,5069,1

5146,Junky product that borders on consumer fraud.,5146,1
5147,The nightgown was pretty and fit well.,5147,1

5153,I don't even know how to describe the pattern.,5153,1
5153,It looks like they took a picture of a picture and then printed it on.,5153,1
5153,I ended up having to go buy gold acrylic paint and paint over the pattern to make it look like what I expected to receive.,5153,1
5153,"Unless you feel like turning this into a craft project, don't buy this pillow case.",5153,1

5167,Before the purchase when I found out this jacket and looked at the pics at first glance I said WoOw that's what I want for it sounds awesome and durable however when I received it I just got shocked then and asked my brother is this really the same one shown on Amazon ohh God maybe I got drunk it's impossible to be the same this is just a light T shirt or some underwear stuff I can wear it in summer.,5167,1
5167,"Well I can say the merchant has succeeded to beautify his whole merchandise in order to mislead poor people like me and you I suggest him to eliminate all these fake pics right away and replace them by his real products, by the way I'm returning this jacket for a refund I just put a star as a minimalist cause I wasn't able to insert less than a star it gotta be nothing I swear.",5167,1

5261,I returned this dress.,5261,1
5262,Got a large....It's so small I can't even wear it.,5262,1
5262,I might have to give it to a kid.,5262,1
5262,This is not a woman's size top.,5262,1
5262,It is kid size.,5262,1
5263,My most disappointing purchase on Amazon...,5263,1
5263,"Completely a cheap, misrepresentation of what was pictured/described.",5263,1
5264,Took a week longer to get here.,5264,1
5264,Peace of garbage.,5264,1
5265,"I have an average sized head, I wear a medium large fitted Hurley hat size and this hat was small.",5265,1
5265,"You can adjust for the circumference of the hat to make it bigger but it isn't very deep, I felt like it was barely sitting on top of my head, it's a nice looking hat but the fit is not good.",5265,1
5265,Maybe someone can pull it off but not the average persons head.,5265,1
5266,Don't bother.,5266,1
5266,"Unless you are TINY this dress will not fit you, and they basically refused to let me return the item even though they have falsely advertised this product with their completely wrong sizing guide",5266,1
5267,Terrible quality,5267,1
5268,The product sent is NOTHING like the photo.,5268,1
5268,Fits awkward.,5268,1
5269,It seems good but it's very light and thin,5269,1
5270,"Since this came from China, I guess the conversion to American size was just off.",5270,1
5270,It was way too small for me to wear.,5270,1
5270,I like the quality but it is unusable as is.,5270,1
5271,Shirt was way too small not the actual American sizes  Cheaply made,5271,1
5272,I did give this bag 4 stars initially but I have revised that to just 1 star.,5272,1
5272,"Initially I said ""Love this bag, I would give it a 5 but the zipper on the inside pocket  keeps coming apart.""",5272,1
5272,Now I all four handles have broken and the decorative pieces have fallen off.,5272,1
5272,This is not the only handbag that I use and I do not overfill it or abuse it.,5272,1
5272,There is no reason that it should be in this shape at this point.,5272,1
5272,"I have many handbags, some are up to 5 years old and they are not falling apart.",5272,1
5272,I would not recommend this bag to anyone.,5272,1
5273,Beautiful bag.,5273,1
5273,It feels sturdy and well made.,5273,1
5273,I just wish it were a little taller so I could fit my textbooks in.,5273,1
5273,But otherwise I'm very happy with the purchase.,5273,1
5273,"The top can be zipped closed, which is really useful since I've had pickpockets take things from my other bags.",5273,1
5273,Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.,5273,1
5273,Update: after just one month of light use the shoulder strap is already tearing off.,5273,1
5273,"Without the strap the bag is useless, since the handles are way too short to go on my shoulder.",5273,1
5273,I expected better for the original price.,5273,1
5273,Waste of money.,5273,1
5274,Too small,5274,1
5275,"This item was not at all like the picture, but it's hit and miss with online clothes.",5275,1
5275,I've ordered before and have received perfect dresses.,5275,1
5276,The elastic in the back is worn and too loose to wear and go into the water.,5276,1
5276,It will be like not wearing a top.,5276,1
5276,Elastic will naturally deteriorate with age and then it loses its elasticity.,5276,1
5276,This is what has happened to the elastic back in this swimsuit making it defective.,5276,1
5276,The use of inferior elastic product is the issue.,5276,1
5277,Very badly designed.,5277,1
5278,Too small,5278,1
5279,Too small for the 2 to 3 yrs old it looks like it fits to a 2 months old child,5279,1
5280,"Cheaply made and very, very small.",5280,1
5281,I was very disappointed in the placement of the design I ordered.,5281,1
5281,"This was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and when I received the shirt, the image was placed much lower and slightly crooked on the shirt.",5281,1
5281,Seems like production was very rushed and not checked over.,5281,1
5282,"Not an adult size, gave them to my 10 and 12 year old great grand kids.",5282,1
5283,Too small.,5283,1
5284,horrible sizing!,5284,1
5284,"the extra large is a extra small, you need to have an A cup or B cup to fit this at most.",5284,1
5284,So upsetting that the top and bottom are so off sizes with each other.,5284,1
5284,Never buying again,5284,1
5285,A 2x would fit my size 8 niece.... so disappointed.,5285,1
5286,"If I could give it a zero, I would!",5286,1
5286,The chain fell apart within a couple days!,5286,1
5286,I almost lost the shoe three times because another piece of chain broke.,5286,1
5286,"Now all I have is a few chain links left and the shoe, nothing to hang it to!",5286,1
5286,Very disappointed!,5286,1
5287,Too small,5287,1
5288,"DO NOT BUY , I don't know who this would fit.",5288,1
5288,The pants fit and then the too part of the jumpsuit doesn't even reach my arms.,5288,1
5288,I expected it would run small so instead of an L I got an XL and it was horrible the material is horrible.,5288,1
5288,They're pretty much leggings.,5288,1
5289,Yeah you're thinking hey it's cheaper than the others.,5289,1
5289,It's got Prime shipping.,5289,1
5289,There are more size options.,5289,1
5289,Don't do it.,5289,1
5289,It's cheap.,5289,1
5289,I'll fitted and thinner than the more expensive one (which I currently own and fits lovely) cough up the extra $ if you don't want an uncomfortable wedgie in the front & back.,5289,1
5289,Just NO.,5289,1
5289,I'm 5'6 with a short torso this is such a fail.,5289,1
5289,DON'T buy it!,5289,1
5290,Wrong color!,5290,1
5290,I ordered ivory!,5290,1
5290,It looked white.,5290,1
5290,It did not match my dress.,5290,1
5291,Way to big and short.,5291,1
5291,More like the length of a shirt.,5291,1
5291,"I am 5-3"" and 135lbs.",5291,1
5291,I am very disappointed.,5291,1
5291,This will never be worn.,5291,1
5292,Not even close to size.,5292,1
5292,The material and workmanship is cheap.,5292,1
5292,All seams were sewn crooked.,5292,1
5293,"I'm usually on a size 14 I bought a 2x knowing that it would run small 2x is too small and im average height 5'5 these came to a weird length too long to be capris and too short to be pants... not to mention it's made out of silky, streachy material.. not a good buy!!",5293,1
5293,!,5293,1
5294,The shirt was to small but I expected that but the shirt that I ordered was not the shirt I received.,5294,1
5295,So I guess I should have been leery when I noticed that the image was Photoshopped onto the hoodie (you can see the hoodie strings going behind the image) but I took a chance and bought it anyway.,5295,1
5295,The first thing I noticed when I got the package was how very small the package was.,5295,1
5295,Very thin.,5295,1
5295,"Upon opening the item I saw that it was technically a hoodie, just basically a long sleeved t-shirt with a hood on it.",5295,1
5295,"Still technically counts, but not the sort of hoodie I've grown accustomed to.",5295,1
5295,The biggest issue is the decal.,5295,1
5295,It does have the piston on it with the phrase.,5295,1
5295,"But it is faded, wrinkled and cheap looking.",5295,1
5295,"The letters and piston are not individually ironed on, it is one single decal and the space in between the letters is very noticeable.",5295,1
5295,It looks like something you'd make at home for a third of the price.,5295,1
5295,"They also list this as 80% cotton, 20%# polyester.",5295,1
5295,Pretty sure this is BS.,5295,1
5295,"There's no tag inside the hoodie, however.",5295,1
5295,So no way to tell where it came from or what the blend is.,5295,1
5295,Pretty sure it's not majority cotton though.,5295,1
5295,This one will be going back for sure.,5295,1
5296,I ordered an xl andt the equivalent of a sm/med.,5296,1
5296,I'm not exaggerating when I saw that I couldn't even get it past my chest...,5296,1
5297,If does not fit as advertised.,5297,1
5297,The bottom of the suit fits like panties instead of being a long tall fit and the top doesn't tie tight enough to hold as advertised,5297,1
5298,They're fake don't buy,5298,1
5299,"I purchased these red ""leggings"" , thinking that I would have a nice bright, pick-me-up color of Capri workout pants.",5299,1
5299,WRONG !,5299,1
5299,!!!!,5299,1
5299,"These are tights or nylon-ish , I am for once at a loss for WORDS.",5299,1
5299,"WOW....... is about all I can really say to my whole experience of opening them up and....,just....., WOW !",5299,1
5300,the size was a problem either 16.5 or 17.5 but not a full 17 unless you pay 50,5300,1
5301,Product was too small when a return was requested they said it would be too expensive to send it back and to just give it to someone else.,5301,1
5302,Not the best Quilty,5302,1
5303,To small,5303,1
5304,Not even close.,5304,1

5307,More like sleep wear.,5307,1
5308,Size runs very small and it cost more in shipping to return it than I paid for the dress.,5308,1
5309,This mask does not allow enough room for the child's face in order to breathe properly.,5309,1
5309,Not enough ventilation = dangerous unless supervised.,5309,1

5340,"At first I ordered my standard 34"" waist, which arrived as a very conservative 33 inches - don't get me wrong, 33"" would be nice, but just isn't quite yet comfortable.",5340,1
5340,"So I resubmitted for a 36"" (next in selection), which arrived as an overly-stated, spacious interpretation of a fairly portly representation of somebody quite larger than me.",5340,1
5340,"I'll be returning both, not to attempt a third, more disappointingly misrepresentative outcome.",5340,1
5341,These pants are no where near what you think they are.,5341,1

5366,I purchased the outfit after reading her review.,5366,1
5366,"I am 5'11 and thought, hey, sounds pretty good I'll give it shot.",5366,1
5366,"Well, I did and it was a complete waste of money for me.",5366,1
5366,"Since it would cost as much money to return it as it would be to keep and give away, I will do the latter.",5366,1
5366,"Let me say that my measurements are 39-29-39, not small by a longshot but WAY too small for the 3X holy cow.",5366,1
5366,The thing is so huge you could put two people in it.,5366,1
5366,And there is no way to alter the elastic as it is sewn into the jumpsuit.,5366,1
5366,You'd actually have to have some real sewing skills to try to pull that off.,5366,1
5366,"The style is ok, and the quality of the material is ok, but unless you are at least a 14+ then this is definitely a pass.",5366,1
5367,Very poor quality.,5367,1
5367,Breaks easily.,5367,1

5379,Just a few days ago I took it off at the end of 5he day and the pin that goes through the holes was completely bent!,5379,1
5379,Do not buy this belt.,5379,1
5379,Spend the extra to get something that will last.,5379,1
5380,"Even based on the size reference chart they provided, jacket was way too small and what made matters worse was the expense I would've incurred just to exchange it!",5380,1
5380,I inevitably had to keep it and will likely gift it to a friend.,5380,1
5381,The quality of the material is very cheap.,5381,1
5382,Not flattering on me.,5382,1
5382,Will be returning,5382,1
5383,"Too small, they r smaller than a pea",5383,1
5384,Update......I ordered 4 the last one I received was the wrong one.,5384,1
5384,Wrong size wrong color and see thru.,5384,1
5384,Not happy.,5384,1
5384,Runs small.,5384,1
5384,Soft stretchy.,5384,1
5384,Extremely comfortable.,5384,1
5384,I'm plus size and it fits a little snug but better then I expected.,5384,1
5384,I've now ordered 3.,5384,1
5384,Snags easy tho,5384,1
5385,These shoes are very stiff and have no give.,5385,1
5385,The back of the shoe digs into the child's heel.,5385,1
5385,Cute but not practical.,5385,1
5386,I hope you like ironing!,5386,1
5386,These are made of some strange iron resistant material.,5386,1
5386,I highly doubt they are actual cotton.,5386,1
5386,I have to spend AT LEAST 20 minutes ironing one shirt.,5386,1
5386,The colors are nice and they fit well but ironing for that long isn't worth it.,5386,1
5386,My other shirts take maybe 5 minutes if they are very wrinkled.,5386,1
5386,Keep shopping.,5386,1
5386,Pay a few more bucks for a higher quality shirt.,5386,1
5387,Bought this for my Girlfriend.,5387,1
5387,The size and fabric is perfect.,5387,1
5387,BUT the zipper broke the very first time she tried to zip it down.,5387,1
5387,The zipper was very poor quality and the elements bent on the first pass of the zipper making it impossible to correct or zip back up.,5387,1
5387,Would not buy again or recommend to buy until the zipper is changed to a different manufacturer.,5387,1
5388,Not sized as stated on the chart.,5388,1
5388,I would not recommend these to a friend.,5388,1
5388,"And they've said they refunded my money, but never have!",5388,1
5389,Started fading as soon as it's used.,5389,1
5390,Broken,5390,1
5391,Returned---too large.,5391,1
5392,Horrible product.,5392,1
5392,It's turning to an ugly yellow rust color after 1 month of use.,5392,1
5392,"No longer ""gold""!!",5392,1
5392,Stay away from this product.,5392,1
5392,Do not purchase.,5392,1
5392,Starting to question all jewelry sold by amazon & it's merchant partners.,5392,1
5393,I actually love the shirt..,5393,1
5393,I just wish I was able to wear it.,5393,1
5393,"I ordered an XL and it might, MIGHT fit my petite sister...",5393,1
5393,Very disappointed.,5393,1
5393,I really would love to see what the small size looks like if this is the XL.,5393,1
5394,"Don't buy them, bad quality even for made in China products.",5394,1
5394,The plastic it was made from had a wired smell and I suspect it was from industrial waste.,5394,1
5394,"As a Chinese, I could tell that these slippers won't worth a quarter even in China.",5394,1
5394,Totally waste of money and don't even feel like returning.,5394,1
5394,Will through away.,5394,1
5395,"poor logo design the letters starting to peel of after the first wash
and it was not deliver on time",5395,1
5396,Horrible doesn't look anything like the picture!,5396,1
5397,Don't waste your money.,5397,1
5397,"Too small, XL seem like M",5397,1
5398,"Poor quality, neck cuff is all messed up after washing.",5398,1
5398,Looks sloppy,5398,1
5399,The size ended up being way to small.,5399,1
5399,I'd suggest showing sizes for all nationalities for an American XXL and an Asian XXL are very different.,5399,1
5400,Cheaply made front pocket ripped the first day of use,5400,1
5401,"Loved the color and it is a functional bag, but after less than a month of use, the zipper on the outside pocket broke.",5401,1
5401,I wasn't able to get it back on track again so it gaps open.,5401,1
5401,I guess you get what you pay for!,5401,1

5403,awful!,5403,1
5403,Dont waste your money,5403,1
5404,They look cute in the picture... very cheap looking in real life.,5404,1
5404,They look like earrings you would get for .99 at a dollar store.,5404,1
5404,Plus I couldn't even wear them if I wanted to because one of the posts is bent and doesn't stay on.,5404,1
5405,I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this suit.,5405,1
5405,What they say is true: the suit is absolutely adorable and absolutely unwearable unless (and this is not an exaggeration) you are 6'2 and wear a size 4.,5405,1
5405,The torso of this suit is so long that it's freakish.,5405,1
5405,Even most super models aren't this tall.,5405,1
5405,"And it's just too bad, because this suit is so cute that it breaks my heart.",5405,1
5405,:(,5405,1
5406,The only thing this could be used for a nightgown.,5406,1
5406,"The fabric is see through, I purchased it in white.",5406,1
5406,It doesn't look any thing like the picture and the cut of the dress is just bad.,5406,1
5406,I plan on now using it as a swim suit cover cause that is maybe the only other use I'd get out of it.,5406,1
5406,"Cheap, cheap fabric and a really terrible print.",5406,1
5406,I expected so much better but sadly this dress is just horrible.,5406,1
5406,Save your money and get something else!,5406,1
5407,I wrote the company and after two weeks received no reply.,5407,1
5407,The watch winder stopped working after about 13 or 14 months.,5407,1
5407,Another is still working after about a year.,5407,1
5407,Hope it continues.,5407,1
5407,But for the company not to reply for a rear part or repair request is unacceptable....not to mention that the product should last more than 13-14 months.,5407,1
5407,I bit the bullet and bought a Wolf winder to replace it.,5407,1
5407,Will never buy another Beloncia.,5407,1
5408,Cheap fabric and doesnt fit true to size,5408,1
5409,"No, i received Earings instead of the charm.",5409,1

5416,Do not buy!,5416,1
5416,This was poorly made.,5416,1

5421,The necklace was broken.,5421,1
5421,I had read negative reviews but didn't think it would be that bad.,5421,1
5421,they should either check their products before sending or not give a false picture,5421,1
5422,"Item was broken when I received it, and it looks very cheap and flimsy.",5422,1
5423,I like the purse but the handles will not stay buckled and the straps come undone when I lift the purse.,5423,1
5424,It seems to stick well but way too small.,5424,1
5424,I wear a 34B and ordered the B size.,5424,1
5425,Fit like a shirt,5425,1
5426,"The ""flap"" appears to be a misprint.",5426,1
5426,The bears and the saying are printed upside down on the flap.,5426,1
5426,content://media/external/file/31059,5426,1
5427,"It's a great design unfortunately I believe mine came with a faulty string, it came apart and 2 of the rings broke, shame, will change review if seller follows up.",5427,1
5428,"Listing said size 52 I assumed, silly me, that here in the USA that meant inches.",5428,1

5434,It feels like tissue paper.,5434,1
5434,I am very disappointed with the material and sizing of this skirt.,5434,1

5436,"ok looking shirt, but made way way too small.",5436,1
5436,i wear Ariat 3X and they fit loose and comfortable this 3X would not even button at all.,5436,1
5436,It is literally 4 inches smaller around.,5436,1
5436,I would say a 3X is more of a big 1X.,5436,1
5437,Pants are very short & Waist band is super type.,5437,1
5437,Couldn't wear the pants at all.,5437,1
5437,Shirt was cute.,5437,1
5438,"I was very disappointed when I received this ""sweater"" in the mail.",5438,1

5438,"They have since changed the description to ""jacket"" but the material says it is a cotton blend, I'm not sure what the blend is but it seems more like a spandex/ polyester something or another.",5438,1

5453,Latch broke in less than 2 weeks.,5453,1
5453,"I emailed the company to let them know that it is unusable with a broken latch, but haven't heard anything for over a week.",5453,1

5473,"This means small rib cage, but large breasts with an overall bust measurement of 39 inches.",5473,1
5473,I ordered the XL in hopes that the cup size would increase along with the band size.,5473,1
5473,I knew I could easily tailor the band size smaller as long as the cups were large enough.,5473,1
5473,"Good plan, right?",5473,1
5473,Nope.,5473,1
5473,"The flat lace fabric triangle  measures only 6"" wide by 5"" long (NOT A FORMED CUP AT ALL, no darting or gathers, nothing but flat fabric).",5473,1

5473,"If it covers what you need covered, then you're good to go.",5473,1
5473,It makes me look like an anime character.,5473,1
5473,It's basically a big nipple cover and exposes way too much breast to wear under a sheer shirt .,5473,1
5473,I'd be attracting a LOT of attention and the pearl-clutchers would have a case of the vapors if they saw that in a public place.,5473,1
5473,It's not worth the time & effort to return it.,5473,1
5473,"Maybe I can add lace here or there, but for now, it's just going to be regulated to bedroom romping.",5473,1

5538,"I bought it big because I knew it would be small... Its spandex, it looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture.",5538,1
5538,Its just overall a terrible purchase,5538,1

5544,"This dress looks amazing in the photo - the color is beautiful, the style is beautiful.",5544,1

5544,"In real life without edited photos, the dress looks like a drab mumu or house gown.",5544,1
5544,It does not fit as nicely as the photo.,5544,1

5549,I washed it hoping it would look better once it was ironed but it still looked terrible.,5549,1
5549,It was too tight in the waist and the pleating in the bust region is very awkward.,5549,1
5549,The picture is very deceiving.,5549,1
5549,I was looking for a simple red dress to wear for a Christmas party and this looked trashy and the seams look like they're about to fall apart.,5549,1
5549,I will never wear this again.,5549,1
5549,Do not buy!,5549,1
5550,I bought this ring to wear to work (4-10 hour days) instead of my wedding ring and band because I wash my hands excessively.,5550,1
5550,I've noticed that over ten years with my wedding ring I have significantly worn down the gold (I work in a hospital).,5550,1
5550,So I purchased this ring and in less than a month I've already lost two stones!,5550,1
5550,"I understand that some of you may say, ""what would you expect from costume jewelry?""",5550,1

5561,Cheap material total rip off for the price about to return it.,5561,1
5562,I was so unimpressed with this dress in so many ways but the fit and quality were the most unimpressive.,5562,1
5562,"This was tight for a size that always fits (so, it fits small, ladies and wasn't loose, was way fitted on me) and GOD it was short.",5562,1
5562,"Not to mention being super SUPER sheer, so unless you had a nude full body slip or don't mind people seeing your business then avoid.",5562,1
5562,"I tried it on and immediately sequins began to fall off, even though nothing ripped in the process.",5562,1
5562,"The seams are shoddy, they lay super awkwardly and strangely- not well made.",5562,1

5563,"The picture looks really nice, however the purse is very unpractical!",5563,1
5563,It's not easy to buckle it and the chain is a little weird.,5563,1

5566,?,5566,1
5566,??,5566,1
5566,I wanted to see what size I am at after letting my ears size down naturally in order to order metal plugs online.,5566,1
5566,I cannot do this because as I still do not know my size due to the wide variety of completely unlabeled and mismatched sizes.,5566,1
5567,junk,5567,1
5568,"Terribly thin, returned fight away",5568,1
5569,It's nothing but a piece of cardboard wrapped in fabric sticks out on your sides and don't conture your body I returned,5569,1

5617,"Three times I ordered this product as the description noted 1 package of 12 and every time o reached just 1 hat, not a package of 12",5617,1
5618,"First, I was disappointed to find that the back  prong is not covered, it's just bare metal so in addition to being pointy and hard, it is more prone to slipping through fine toddler hair than the clips that are covered front and back.",5618,1
5618,"Second, they fell apart within hours.",5618,1
5618,See photos.,5618,1
5619,"Unfortunately, this product gave out on me after two uses this winter.",5619,1
5619,"When I brought it out to use on my spring shoes, the foot would not split open wider than an inch or so.",5619,1
5619,"After that point, it made a clicking sound with each turn and I could tell some internal mechanism was off.",5619,1
5619,The item simply does not serve a purpose if it only opens an inch.,5619,1
5619,"Mike at Footfitter offered instructions on how to ""fix"" the problem that did nothing to help.",5619,1
5619,"He then sent me a replacement item, which I was happy to receive.",5619,1
5619,"However, when I opened the container box, I could see that the condition of the item box was poor - scratched and dented.",5619,1
5619,"Then, I tried the item itself and it did not open AT ALL.",5619,1
5619,I found dirt and debris in the spiral part next to the foot and there were minor scratches on the foot.,5619,1
5619,I assume this was an item sitting around the warehouse or maybe even one that was returned.,5619,1
5619,I didn't mind the condition of the replacement - used or new - I just wanted a working item.,5619,1
5619,I'm very disappointed with my overall experience.,5619,1
5619,"To add insult to injury, the email I received when I informed them of that the replacement did not work at all had essentially doubted how truthful I was being about its condition.",5619,1

5685,"Terrible, awful, do not buy these!",5685,1
5685,The thin aluminum clip completely broke apart under normal pressure.,5685,1
5685,The construction of the clips is merely 3 pieces that are held together by each other to create the pressure.,5685,1
5685,Was just trying to clip them on and the clip exploded into pieces across the room.,5685,1
5685,Tried to repair them because I needed them and the metal is so cheap it just bends.,5685,1

5699,Almost like weaved in where they shouldn't have been.,5699,1
5699,"Very strange and when I pulled out of package more hoops fell out which was good so that I could fix it myself, though I doubt it will hold up long.",5699,1
5699,"Bought to wear with good outfits, but only nice enough to wear with my halloween costume and I hope it at least holds up for that one night.",5699,1
5699,"Even though it cost very little, not worth it cause it may either be totally unfixable when you get it or last a night.",5699,1

5705,Cheap material,5705,1

5706,The blush pink color is much less vibrant than in the picture - almost looks dirty.,5706,1

5757,I was disappointed beyond words when I opened the package to find this dress someone tries to pass as cotton!,5757,1
5757,It is going back tomorrow.,5757,1
5757,Just because the tag tells me it is 100% cotton does not make it so.,5757,1

5766,I received the pocketbook on time the problem was after giving it as a gift it broke the very next day right on the loop that holds it.,5766,1

5904,The material is nothing like what is pictured.,5904,1
5904,The dress is really short and barely covers the necessary parts and the only reason it covers the front is because of the shear layer on top.,5904,1

5921,I did not get what the picture said and I was not overalls happy with the product.,5921,1
5922,"these are a lot of gloves for the money, however they are super cheap!!",5922,1

5923,DON'T buy this product.,5923,1

5924,Product Material is too thin.,5924,1

5924,"The top was too small, not enough material to wrap around as in the picture.",5924,1
5924,There were no instructions on how to wrap the top.,5924,1
5925,I think I got a knockoff.,5925,1
5925,I have three CK v's already that I got at Costco that fit better and are way softer.,5925,1
5925,"On the shirts from here, it says Calvin Klein on the bottom left, on the front of the shirt.",5925,1
5925,That is not displayed in the picture and I feel like a dick if I don't wear anything over it.,5925,1
5925,"All in all, I feel ripped off.",5925,1
5926,The photo forgot to show how wide the sweater is and instead they tucked it in.,5926,1
5926,Deceiving!!,5926,1
5926,It made me look like a humongous.,5926,1
5927,We only got one pair of the pajamas.,5927,1
5928,Very flimsy feel,5928,1
5929,Looks very nice and pretty.,5929,1
5929,Then you put it on and it turns black.. Bad quality... Do not recommended.,5929,1
5930,"A L Looks like q kids size medium, very cheap fabric, not as long as picture either, litteraly it fit my little cousin perfectly who very very skinny and it was a Large.",5930,1

5932,These only lasted for one wear.,5932,1
5932,I ended up having to return them.,5932,1
5933,This is not a dress but a shirt made to look like the Free People photo of a dress they knocked off.,5933,1
5933,"If they would of added 5 inches it might of hit tunic territory, but I learned a lesson in buying knock off made in China dresses via this purchase.",5933,1
5934,Did not look like it did in the picture,5934,1
5935,Way too small.,5935,1
5936,I'm really not happy.,5936,1
5936,I was looking forward to this shirt but it's too small and I ordered a small and am usually an XS.,5936,1
5936,the sleeves are quarter length and the buckle is complicated.,5936,1
5936,cheap material.,5936,1
5936,but I guess if you order up two sizes you might be okay,5936,1
5937,"This shirt is supposed to be a 3X  and it certainly is not, this shirt fits my size 10 sister.",5937,1
5938,The shorts don't look anything like the picture.,5938,1
5938,They are so ugly.,5938,1
5938,Very disappointed.,5938,1
5938,I wouldn't waste your money or time with these.,5938,1
5939,Don't buy.... horrible... 0 stars,5939,1
5940,This piece broke after 30 secs of trying it on.,5940,1
5941,In the picture you can see the most beatiful drees but in real is awful and  poor quality,5941,1
5942,would not recommend it...not that satisfying nor quality nor fit,5942,1
5943,"These are very poorly made (one pair worn once, and washed in washer once), material separated from side seam, leaving several large holes.",5943,1

5946,Probably would have worked if longer.,5946,1
5946,Looks nothing like the picture,5946,1
5947,Cheaply made and sized small.,5947,1
5948,"does not hold well, buy earlifts instead",5948,1
5949,Item for an infant arrived stained dirty and I have to pay to ship it back.,5949,1
5950,The shirt arrived quickly enough.,5950,1
5950,Maybe too quickly.,5950,1
5950,I'm guessing the decal had not cooled off yet when the shirt was folded and placed in the package because the decal was sticking to other parts of the decal that it was folded over on (see pictures).,5950,1
5950,"So when I unfolded the shirt for the 1st time, small parts of the decal ripped off to give it a retro look.",5950,1
5950,There's also a pretty bad chemical smell from the decal.,5950,1
5950,"I'm sure it can be washed out, but I don't know how many washes you'll get out of this shirt before the decal is totally ruined.",5950,1
5950,This shirt is NOT worth the money which is sad because there is a market for this product.,5950,1
5950,My package was also missing a receipt.,5950,1
5951,This is the first time i would buy XL shirt that is so small that my arms could not go into.,5951,1
5951,My wardrobe is filled with XL clothes and i had never had such experience before.,5951,1
5951,i can only assume that XL in China must be Medium in USA.,5951,1
5951,"i bought 4 items on Amazon, i have received 3 and i am absolutely satisfied with 2.",5951,1
5951,Unfortunately this shirt is a disappointment and i needed to wear it by next Sunday so i don't have the time to have it sent back for any adjustment.,5951,1
5951,i would have to discard of it and go shopping in stores for a better shirt.,5951,1
5952,Terrible won't ever order from them again.,5952,1
5952,Had to give this to my 13 year old niece.,5952,1
5953,Seriously feels like a costume materia got it in black hoping it wouldnt do that and its see thru no matter what you wear underneath,5953,1
5954,Poor quality,5954,1
5955,Extremely short and ill fitting in the bust area.,5955,1
5955,Tried to return it and they want me to send a picture of the dress.,5955,1
5955,I am not going to jump through all of those hoops.,5955,1
5955,Very thin and poor quality.,5955,1
5955,I am just going to give this away to a teenager who is probably a size 2/4.,5955,1
5955,Do not buy from this company if you might return an item.,5955,1
5956,Too small and one of the socks ripped completely as I took it out of the package and put it on.,5956,1

5958,Too small and tight not loose at all,5958,1
5959,Not true to size chart or color.,5959,1
5960,I read a review saying the customer received a t-shirt instead of a muscle tank but thought it was a mistake.,5960,1
5960,The other reviews stated the product was great and just what they wanted (assuming it was the muscle tank as described).,5960,1
5960,"However, I also received a t-shirt instead.",5960,1
5960,"It is boxy and short, it's not at all the fit nor style I ordered.",5960,1
5960,If you are selling a t-shirt instead of a muscle tank (as shown and described) then it BETTER be listed as such.,5960,1
5961,Came dirty..,5961,1
5962,I included a picture but I was under the impression I would be getting an official jack daniels t shirt and got this?,5962,1
5962,It's a shiny material most commonly used for Halloween costumes.,5962,1
5962,Completely disappointed and sending this back.,5962,1
5963,Scam....comes from Asia.,5963,1
5964,Please I will have to send this back.,5964,1
5964,It's just too small for me.,5964,1

5965,I had to send this back.,5965,1
5965,"I did all the measurements, but the skirt was shorter than advertised.",5965,1
5965,The color was accurate and pretty though.,5965,1
5966,This one runs very small!,5966,1
5966,I can not wear it but other items ordered at the same time in the same size fits just fine.,5966,1
5967,Ordered in spring sent xs  ordered xl now I get one in late nov large still too small around a size 5 thin can't wear wouldn't wear too thin shows all your business,5967,1
5968,Large is medium,5968,1
5969,This item was made very cheaply and has no shape.,5969,1
5969,It does not look like the picture.,5969,1
5969,Don't be fooled by the images.,5969,1
5969,This is not worth your time or money.,5969,1
5970,hate it .cheaply made .To small,5970,1

5971,Super disappointed!,5971,1
5971,Never order this-total waste of money,5971,1
5972,I received this bracelet today and went to link the chain and it instantly broke.,5972,1
5972,I am very unsatisfied with this product and would like a full refund or amazon credit for being a annual customer.,5972,1
5972,Thank you,5972,1
5973,I was really excited when I ordered this as I was a huge fan of the company back in their hayday.,5973,1
5973,"However, I received the sweatshirt today and was highly disappointed.",5973,1
5973,I ordered a XXL as that's what I wear and it fit like a large.,5973,1
5973,It is extremely too tight.,5973,1
5973,This is totally mis-sized and anyone should buy this two sizes bigger than needed.,5973,1
5974,I tired the shirt at the vans store and I liked the large size.,5974,1
5974,So I decided to buy the large size thru Amazon because I had a gift card.,5974,1
5974,Little did I know once I got the shirt it was to wide and made me look kinda fat but I guess I can try to make it work if not return it.,5974,1
5975,Dress arrived on time but it only resembles the picture.,5975,1
5975,Material n shape seems different.,5975,1
5975,"The neckline is higher, button holes were too big so there was a gap where it pulled apart.",5975,1
5975,"It did not meet my expectations, i was disappointed.",5975,1
5975,I loved the pictured dress i wish that is what i had received.,5975,1
5976,To short for my taste,5976,1
5977,"Made sizes for a kid apparently, I got xlarge fits my daughter that wears small.",5977,1
5977,From China must be sizing issue.,5977,1
5978,I ordered a small.,5978,1
5978,It's HUGE,5978,1
5979,As I said before,5979,1
5980,The blouse was attractive and what I expected except for one small thing.,5980,1
5980,It's too small.,5980,1
5980,"Not a little too small, a lot too small.",5980,1
5980,I ordered a US women's size 16 and received (see photos) a US women's size 8.,5980,1
5980,I can't determine if the blouse would be one that I would like to wear because I can't wear it.,5980,1
5980,I got this top at a discount in exchange for reviewing it.,5980,1
5980,I can't say that I like or don't like it because I could not actually wear it.,5980,1
5981,Cheap material,5981,1
5982,Defective when received.,5982,1
5982,Underwire was not sewn in properly.,5982,1
5982,Amazon mktplace also tried to double charge my credit card for this item!,5982,1
5983,"As shown, it looks great in pictures and there really is no alternative if you want a real-looking astronaut outfit.",5983,1
5983,But it is just a painted plastic shell with 2 buttons.,5983,1
5983,My daughter accidentally pushed the visor back and broke the button -now it won't stay down.,5983,1
5983,"There's a note about that, but hard to explain to a 5yr old that it's a ""one and done"" rule.",5983,1
5983,"Again, it will look great in pictures, but it's an expensive piece of plastic.",5983,1
5984,Poor quality and too huge of hoops.,5984,1
5984,Looked terrible with my dress.,5984,1
5985,I wanted the pictured sweatshirt.,5985,1
5985,INstead I get one with Marshalls face on it.,5985,1
5985,WRONG DEAD wrong.,5985,1
5985,I have a 4 year old who loves his sweatshirt and he wears it like everyday.,5985,1
5986,Big and garish looking.,5986,1
5986,"Ugly, actually.",5986,1
5987,Fits as expected when you first get the romper.,5987,1
5987,Shrinks after one wash.,5987,1
5988,"Awful, awful, awful.",5988,1
5988,This dress is HUGE.,5988,1
5988,"I was expecting this to be oversized, which I like, but it literally looks like a hospital gown.",5988,1
5988,The material is also extremely cheap.,5988,1
5988,"Do yourself a favor, and don't buy this.",5988,1
5989,"As per the reviews, the fit is really big, but oddly proportioned.",5989,1
5989,I'm 6 feet tall and typically wear a size 12.,5989,1
5989,"The measurements for the large size costume seemed accurate, but the fit is way off.",5989,1
5989,The corset/bodice is huge and better for someone with a DD chest.,5989,1
5989,"There is elastic around the back of the bodice, but the entire back panel sags, making the skirt fall uneven.",5989,1
5989,"The neck opening of the cape is very small too, and the velcro fastener closes too snugly.",5989,1
5989,There are large tags and strings everywhere that need to be snipped.,5989,1
5989,The arm cuffs are also super wide.,5989,1
5989,I'm going to try and have a seamstress sew up the sides a little and try to make it fit instead of attempting to return this.,5989,1
5989,"I'm really disappointed with the quality, workmanship and value for the price.",5989,1
5989,It's not worth it.,5989,1
5989,"Take your chances, buy some fabric from a craft store and try sewing your own outfit - you would probably have more success.",5989,1
5990,Not what I expected,5990,1
5991,To big,5991,1
5992,These are just awful.,5992,1
5992,"I ordered a medium, as the size chart recommends (I'm a 36 D).",5992,1
5992,I think I should have gone with a small.,5992,1
5992,"The band is too big, but the cups are too small.",5992,1
5992,The shoulder straps feel really weird.,5992,1
5992,Almost like they are their own peice and not part of the bra.,5992,1
5992,They just slide right off no matter how tight they are.,5992,1
5992,Even when tightened all the way down the come off.,5992,1
5992,It's super weird.,5992,1
5992,I also want to add that the nude color is the most yellow looking nude I've ever seen.,5992,1
5993,"I love how it looks, very nice!",5993,1
5993,BUT... with less than 2 weeks of using it started to tearing.,5993,1
5993,Looks fancy but very poor quality material,5993,1
5994,I did my research and read a lot of reviews before finally deciding it may be worth the $$$ to buy these and try them out.,5994,1
5994,Based on reviews I went a size larger and they STILL were too small.,5994,1
5994,I know the point is for them to be tight but not uncomfortable.,5994,1
5994,I sent these back minutes after opening the package.,5994,1
5994,Do not waste your money.,5994,1
5994,Granny panties from Walmart do the trick just fine!,5994,1
5995,"Ridiculously small,  I ordered an XL and it just fits my daughter who is a size 0",5995,1
5996,Pretty dress but color was not even close to what was shown online.,5996,1
5997,"Unfortunately, this Flex Supreme does NOT have enough support over the toe and ankle are for my requirements.",5997,1
5997,Returning for credit.,5997,1
5997,Thanks anyway.,5997,1
5998,A knock off shirt.,5998,1
5998,Extremely large and so cheap.,5998,1
5999,It's ok,5999,1
6000,I was really excited only to have this dress doesn't fit and very disappointed that I must come up with a dress to wear to my daughter's wedding,6000,1
6001,Not one battery in the bunch had any power.,6001,1
6001,Did they just never get charged?,6001,1
6001,"I don't know, but quite the bummer that we can't use the remote control",6001,1
6002,You should NOT buy this product.,6002,1
6002,"When you first receive it, it looks great!",6002,1
6002,I mean it has all the Triangl tags and comes in the Triangl printed plastic bag.,6002,1
6002,"But once you wear it in the water, the straps surrounding the main part of the bikini start to leak into eachother and the green part in my case.",6002,1
6002,"And in the photos, it doesn't look as bad but when you see it in person, it is a lot worse.",6002,1
6003,"For the price, I don't mind that it's thin, cheaply made, and the glow part is sort of painted on.",6003,1
6003,"What I can't forgive, is that only about half of the nickel sized space inside the locket glows.",6003,1
6003,"Apparently, it was just too much to ask to not see the metal shining through spots inside the small dot of glow paint.",6003,1
6004,"This is a very, very cheap quality item and my daughter had it two days and the entire thing unraveled and fell apart.",6004,1
6004,We can't even fix it!!,6004,1
6004,Don't buy!,6004,1

6015,Hideous dress.,6015,1
6015,It's like a night gown,6015,1
6016,Description not accurate.,6016,1
6017,It figures after I order a size larger than I normally wear and return the product that the sizing chart gets updated.,6017,1
6017,Turns out I really need a full 3 sizes larger.,6017,1
6017,I'm glad someone posted a revised chart though.,6017,1

6079,"What came was not a children's size 8, this could have easily fit a grown man who wears a normal small or medium.",6079,1
6079,Disappointing and had to return.,6079,1
6080,"Knew it ran small, but this is ridiculous!",6080,1
6081,not what i thought it would look like and too small,6081,1
6082,Measurements are not correct.,6082,1
6082,I ordered based off the measurements listed and what I received was no were near the correct measurements for the medium and large.,6082,1
6083,Apparently this item ran three sizes too small.,6083,1
6083,I couldn't even pull it up pass my knee cap.,6083,1
6083,"I read all the reviews,  I ordered up X 3 sizes.",6083,1
6084,"material is awful, i bought size s and its big...not as in picture",6084,1
6085,"These sunglasses look authentic, however, they did not come with the case, etc, as shown in their last photo.",6085,1
6085,I am not able to paste the link to Tom Fords website here on how to spot a fake so - Please see attached photo snapshots!,6085,1
6085,"According to Tom Fords site, this seller is not meeting the first six items for authentic glasses!",6085,1
6086,"Don't see how this product can help, too much high waisted, didn't see any butt lifting effect at all.",6086,1
6087,There are two approaches to designing and producing  a sun protective natural fiber straw type hat:  The way Tula does it using time honored quality materials and craftsmanship and the  way O'neill does it with the MBA/ California style of anything goes and we hope it works.,6087,1
6087,This hat fit good and I really liked it until I discovered its 2 big flaws.,6087,1
6087,2.,6087,1
6087,"The straw is really cheap and the fibers break up from one wearing on a  motor boat  whereas my Tula hat lasted for years of wearing on land and water
  1.",6087,1
6087,"To compensate for cheap material and cheap workmanship, O'neill installed a liner under the entire brim to block the sun because the straw does not.",6087,1
6087,"That part works but they put no liner under the crown, perhaps to save money on labor or because they were dumb to figure out how to do it or to make the hat cooler.",6087,1
6087,This hat is a medical device in that it is represented to protect the wearer from the dangers of sun exposure and the standards by which it is reviewed need be very high.,6087,1
6087,Wearing this hat by any wearer who does not have a dense coat of hair on the top of their head exposes the wearer's scalp to sun exposure and damage.,6087,1
6088,Not as cute in person as picture!,6088,1
6089,This was not a PLUS SIZE romper at all.,6089,1

6089,Not true to size at all.,6089,1
6090,Do not buy this dress.,6090,1
6090,When I receive my dress it was lime green and not at all true to the color in the picture.,6090,1
6090,And talking to the company and trying to get a refund I was only able to get half my money back and that's after I argued my point.,6090,1
6091,This does not feel comfortable to wear for a long period of time,6091,1
6092,I left it in the car and the visor got so hot and melted!,6092,1
6093,If I could give this zero stars I would.,6093,1

6115,I would not recommend.,6115,1
6116,My daughter wore this over her gown to Disney World and she looked like a beautiful princess.,6116,1
6116,What made me hate it in the end was the white flimsy string that is used to tie to keep it tied at the neck broke off rendering it useless for it's purpose and further ruining the look along with some crappy shoes we got.,6116,1
6117,Really crappy material!,6117,1
6118,"Felt great, looked great, fit perfectly...ripped the first time I went to take them off.",6118,1
6118,They have all the durability of panty hose.,6118,1
6118,I don't even have nails but my thumb went right through the seam exactly like what happens with hose.,6118,1
6118,"Again - no long nails, it was the fleshy part of my thumb tip that went through!",6118,1
6118,"If they were a few dollars, it'd be ok, but at this price I really expect more than one wearing!",6118,1

6129,I'm hoping I can return it.,6129,1
6130,Got a 4X fits like a large.,6130,1
6130,Zippers on the wrong side.,6130,1

6136,I have a problem with the zipper coming unzipped while I am wearing them,6136,1
6137,"Was great at first, within a week the etching was nearly gone",6137,1
6138,"On the bright side, it fits.",6138,1
6138,Mostly.,6138,1
6138,(I sized up two sizes.),6138,1
6138,"Unfortunately, I'll never be able to wear it because the bra area has no lining and the white part is completely see through.",6138,1
6138,My areola is totally visible.,6138,1
6138,So I'll be returning it.,6138,1
6139,Very tight at upper bust/back seam; noone likes the back-boob look.,6139,1
6139,Going back.,6139,1
6140,I was very disappointed with this product.,6140,1
6140,I just received it and I assure you this is not what it looked like in the picture.,6140,1
6140,Plus it was extremely tight and had more uncomfortable straps that shown here.,6140,1
6140,It's seams were very cheap and flipped inward at some point and the lace was already torn and the velcro was uncomfortable and uneven.,6140,1
6140,"The other piece was the blind folds which I had no idea what it was until I came back and reviewed my order, it doesn't look like the picture either.",6140,1
6140,In all a very sloppy job.,6140,1
6140,As cheap as it costs.,6140,1
6140,Do not buy this product.,6140,1
6140,Go get a beer with these $2.50 instead.,6140,1
6141,Well there really a nice design but the first day that I receive them I put them on and the ear backing came apart also I think they're a little more prettier in the pictures and they are in person,6141,1
6142,Really bad packaging.,6142,1
6142,The earrings were supposed to be a gift but they came in a cheap plastic bag like they were $5 earrings.,6142,1
6142,Imagine mine embarrassment when My wife got the earrings.,6142,1
6142,also they did not come with any certificate/documentation which would verify their authenticity.,6142,1
6142,"Even if they are real, the fact that they came in a cheap plastic ziplock bag makes me very uncomfortable and I will always keep wondering if they are authentic.",6142,1
6142,Never going to buy expensive earrings again from amazon.,6142,1
6143,Order size up.,6143,1
6143,If your a medium order large.,6143,1
6144,This shirt sucked.,6144,1
6144,After washing it once the picture on the front was peeling off.,6144,1
6145,Size chart does not match actual charge.,6145,1
6146,The dress is all wrong.,6146,1
6146,"The corset  bunch up in the back really bad, and there is no waynto fix it.",6146,1

6152,I will attempt to send them back.,6152,1
6153,Order a size or two bigger.,6153,1
6153,Mine did not fit.,6153,1
6154,The sizes listed are for the UK not USA.,6154,1
6154,I had to return the dress.,6154,1
6154,I am waiting for my refund.,6154,1
6154,That is a shame as it is a nice dress.,6154,1
6155,"The dress itself is very elegant, however I received a dress 2 sizes too small (a medium instead of an XL).",6155,1
6155,"Because of the seller's shipping/size label error, I had to come up with a solution with very little heads up.",6155,1
6155,"Because I clearly ordered an XL and received a Medium instead, I'd like my entire order refunded back to me.",6155,1
6155,I will need to update the exp.,6155,1
6155,on the credit card to be refunded - as the original one has since expired and been renewed with a new exp.,6155,1

6210,This top is so small that only a small child can fit into it.,6210,1
6210,It's like a grown woman can't even fit into this stuff.,6210,1
6210,It's ridiculous.,6210,1

6210,I am highly disappointed.,6210,1

6211,More like a usa medium.,6211,1
6211,Dont purchase this item.,6211,1
6212,"Not true to size chart, horrible.",6212,1
6213,You're kidding right?,6213,1

6220,The ears where coming undone from the white webbing.,6220,1
6220,So i had to sew them back on.,6220,1
6220,But i don't wear them at all im just going to resell them to someone else,6220,1
6221,It looks cheap plastic and,6221,1
6222,Uncomfortable and difficult to put on,6222,1
6223,"Good price, but not worth it.",6223,1
6223,Does not cut tape or anything else well.,6223,1
6223,Broke the first time they were dropped from 1 foot.,6223,1
6224,"This product was advertised as a 100% cotton Official Jack Daniels T shirt and when it arrived 3 weeks later, it was a polyester/jersey material with the cheapest silk screen job done on it.",6224,1
6224,I would never recommend this product to anyone.,6224,1
6224,Spend a little more money and get a real shirt.,6224,1

6225,The quality was poor at best and fit was bad,6225,1
6226,I didn't think it would be so small,6226,1

6231,I can fix them but they are not a very good quality and they will probably come apart again,6231,1
6232,Much too small and tight to be a money holder.,6232,1
6232,Disappointed.,6232,1

6236,No way in hell they could've gotten a positive review.,6236,1
6236,I wouldn't leave one star but in order to leave a review had to at least give a star.,6236,1

6241,Returning.,6241,1
6242,"The shirt is absolutely beautiful, however, the quality is very poor.",6242,1
6242,I wore the shirt only a couple of times and the part where the black fabric is sewn to the printed fabric has come apart.,6242,1
6242,Pleased with the appearance but not satisfied with the fact that I did not get much wear out of it.,6242,1
6243,To small and the material felt cheap..,6243,1
6244,I bought these bed socks for my husband.,6244,1
6244,At first he liked them but after one washing they stretched out and  won't stay on his feet.,6244,1
6244,So that was money wasted.,6244,1
6244,And the sad thing is when they arrived they looked good so I ordered another pair.,6244,1
6245,Horrable!!,6245,1
6245,Just Horrable!!,6245,1
6245,"The caps material feels like paper, I will NOT wear this hat out in public!!!",6245,1

6247,This product is not made very well.,6247,1
6247,I used it twice and the grummet pulled from the side of the bag.,6247,1
6247,Can not be used because the handle was can not be replaced.,6247,1
6248,"The ugliest skirt Ive seen in my life, its so ugly.... the shape is just weird",6248,1

6254,It looks nothing like in the picture.,6254,1
6254,Huge disapointment.,6254,1
6255,I love malas but not this one.,6255,1
6255,"Beads are very small, not 8 mm as advertised, plus they are uneven in size, some bigger, some smaller, which makes it rough on the fingers to use as a mala.",6255,1
6255,I will look elsewhere.,6255,1
6256,Nothing like what I expected.,6256,1
6257,Awful product.,6257,1

6257,Completely mismatched.,6257,1
6257,It's so bad I can't even take it to a tailor to be altered.,6257,1
6257,Even if I had the bottoms altered smaller the top is so small there's no fixing.,6257,1
6258,The only way it will make you loose weight and sweat  is working out,6258,1
6259,"They are very pretty, however, the first time I put them on, the post bent on one of them.",6259,1
6259,Quality is an epic fail.,6259,1
6260,This shirt doesnt look at all like it's picture.,6260,1
6260,"It's not at all fitted, the texture is the cheap waffle texture you get with walmart shirts.",6260,1

6266,Not what I expected.,6266,1
6267,Extremely small,6267,1
6268,I knew when buying this shirt that based on the price it wouldn't be high quality but I expected  it to artlessly not obviously be hand made.,6268,1
6268,The stripes on mine aren't straight and way thinner than the pic.,6268,1
6268,Compared to other women's sizes it runs extremely small.,6268,1

6275,"Also, the button holes were not completely cut.",6275,1

6290,Side cracked when lightly cleaning finger prints away.,6290,1
6291,"If I could rate it lower, I would give it a negative.",6291,1

6293,It was see through and terrible quality.,6293,1
6294,Size runs big,6294,1
6295,"They are a lot smaller than I thought they would  be and did not like the package they came in, they were loose in the package and hard to open so when I  did the ear rings flew across the room.",6295,1

6302,NOT IMPRESSED.,6302,1
6303,Broke almost immediately...,6303,1
6304,"I can wear any elastic waist between ladies size 12 to 14, because it can give or take room either way depending on how small or large it is sewn.",6304,1
6304,"And yet I could not squeeze this thing over my hips and behind,  and I have narrow hips!",6304,1
6304,The skirt by itself is absolutely beautiful!,6304,1
6304,It feels and looks wonderful.,6304,1
6304,Therefore I gave it to my daughter who is very skinny and wears a CHILD size 16 or an adult ladies size extra small -  it fits her beautifully if that tells you anything.,6304,1
6304,I kept it for her and I am so glad she will be able to enjoy it.,6304,1

6309,Don't be fooled by these buttons.,6309,1
6310,Super cheap.,6310,1
6310,"The buckle holes in the ""leather"" stretch out so bad.",6310,1
6310,The belt is good for a night if that.,6310,1
6310,Save your money and buy the real thing.,6310,1
6311,Too small and too thin.,6311,1
6311,Very sheer.,6311,1
6312,Cheap quality and it runs pretty small.,6312,1
6313,Terribly awkward fit.,6313,1
6313,"Arms were too short, body part made me look like a rectangle.",6313,1
6313,Haven't worn it out a single time.,6313,1
6314,Too small.,6314,1
6314,And they smell like gasoline even after a few months of having them,6314,1
6315,The centers of the flowers fell off when I opened the box the very first time.,6315,1

6323,Cheap material,6323,1
6324,"Too small, poor quality and not made by Zanzea.",6324,1
6324,I want a refund.,6324,1
6324,I expected them all to be made by Zanzea or at least like they do.,6324,1
6324,Thats why I bought 5 or 6 of these shirts.,6324,1
6324,Refund please,6324,1
6325,I don't usually give reviews but I recently got this for my daughter who loves Owlette.,6325,1

6325,She wasn't fiddling with it or anything.,6325,1
6325,It was just loose.,6325,1
6325,I am returning it...and I'm not sure if it's worth buying again.,6325,1
6326,The jacket is not down!!!,6326,1
6326,"It is ploy fill, I could not feel one feather inside the jacket at all!",6326,1
6326,"That being said, the style, fabric & workmanship was fairly good.",6326,1
6326,Had the jacket been down I probably would have given it a 4-5 star rating.,6326,1
6326,"I would recommend ordering one size up if you wish to order a poly fill jacket, which I did, because of other reviews.",6326,1
6326,The fit was perfect by ordering one size up.,6326,1
6326,If I had ordered my size it would have definetley been too small.,6326,1
6326,But the fact that it was not a down jacket was the biggest disappointment!!!!,6326,1
6326,"I have no use for a poly fill jacket, or paying that price for a poly fill jacket.",6326,1
6326,In my estimation this should be a $20.00 or less product due to the fill.,6326,1
6327,I recommend going a size up.,6327,1
6327,The fit was snug!,6327,1
6328,"It came absolutely wrinkle, the bow not properly attach, looks cheap.",6328,1
6328,You definitely get what you paid for.,6328,1
6328,"If you going to iron it, do not put the iron close to the buttons they melt really fast with the heat, so you cannot iron the part where they are attach",6328,1
6329,peque;o tela mala.,6329,1
6330,Didn't like the material.,6330,1
6331,Doesn't look anything like the picture.,6331,1
6331,Do not like,6331,1
6332,Ordered extra large.,6332,1
6332,Shirt would barely fit a size 0 woman.,6332,1
6332,Very itchy material.,6332,1
6333,"calling shenanigans on all the positive reviews, these are complete and utter tripe.",6333,1
6333,"I haven't worn a ""real"" bra in years, so I'd like to say I'm pretty experienced with the whole applique technique.",6333,1
6333,these things... nothing i did made them functional.,6333,1
6333,"after wasting 6 pairs of pasties, I chucked the entire lot out, ran over to the local store, and bought a box of the stick ons I normally buy.",6333,1
6333,"CONs
1) the glue.",6333,1
6333,"heaven help you if you have to adjust these at all as soon as they've come within a millimeter of your skin, the humidity alone will be enough to destroy the adhesive and you won't be able to re-position them, you'll have to chuck it and get a whole new one and hope it works out better.",6333,1
6333,2) these are STIFF.,6333,1
6333,these will never be invisible.,6333,1
6333,ever.,6333,1
6333,3) they're huge.,6333,1
6333,are these intended for DDD ladies?,6333,1
6333,because i'm pretty sure those women NEVER go without a bra.,6333,1
6333,"these easily cover 1/3 of my actual breast, not just my nipple.",6333,1
6333,"which makes them that much more impossible to place properly so that they're ""invisible"" without creasing and edging.",6333,1
6333,4) the petal shape?,6333,1
6333,how is that supposed to provide any kind of smoothing?!,6333,1
6333,seriously.,6333,1
6333,"men, this shape only works on man boobs, you really do have to test these on women before you market them.",6333,1
6333,"so not only are they huge, but they're huge and expect you to be flat.",6333,1
6333,"5) i gave up, 4 problems was my limit.",6333,1
6333,i threw them out.,6333,1
6333,PROs (there was 1!),6333,1
6333,"the satin covering on them is quite nice, and the coloration is very nude.",6333,1
6333,"if you could actually get these smooth, without creases, bumps, angles, and points, they would be very invisible under the sheerest of fabrics, and not stick to them either.",6333,1
6334,too small even for a person who wears a size 14,6334,1
6335,Did not like it.. Glass looks low quality...,6335,1
6336,It has been 3 months and belt has few patches where leather is damaged and it has come out.,6336,1
6336,I doubt whether the product is genuine.,6336,1

6338,The material is also 100% polyester.,6338,1
6339,Worst shirt I have ever purvhased.,6339,1
6339,It looked like someone out of a sewing class made it and then shipped it.,6339,1
6339,Doesn't even have a tag and strings hanging everywhere off of it.,6339,1
6340,Not very ultrasonic.,6340,1
6341,Way to small!,6341,1
6341,I followed the earlier post and ordered a size bigger than I normally wear (I'm a 4-6 but bigger chested) and ordered a medium.,6341,1
6341,It was so small that my 8 year old who wears a 8-10 could totally wear it with tights as a tunic!,6341,1
6341,!,6341,1
6342,"Cheap, but hey!",6342,1
6342,You get what you pay for.,6342,1
6343,The battery was dead when we opened it,6343,1
6344,It was easily torn on the breast.....a total waste of money,6344,1
6345,This skirt is not as pictured.,6345,1
6345,My skirt is not floor length.,6345,1
6345,"It comes to my knees, and it's not due to height because I'm 5'3"".",6345,1
6345,"I was so excited to receive my skirt, but once I received it, I was very disappointed.",6345,1
6345,I will be returning my skirt and not ordering from this person anymore.,6345,1
6345,Now this experience makes me skeptical about ordering clothing on here.,6345,1
6346,Very poorly made.,6346,1
6346,Cheap fabric and when it came the seams were breaking apart.,6346,1
6346,Not nearly as cute as in the photos.,6346,1
6346,"Fits like a tunic, not a dress.",6346,1
6347,Some kind of jersey/Lycra material used.,6347,1
6347,Not a poly/cotton knit.,6347,1
6347,The colors are not as pictures.,6347,1
6347,Caveat emptur!!,6347,1
6347,This looks like a bad 1960's Laugh In costume,6347,1
6348,Terrible do not order,6348,1
6349,"I really wanted to like these, they're super cute without being over the top.",6349,1
6349,"But they irritated my piercing immediately, causing the top of the hole to become red and itchy.",6349,1
6349,I should say I've had my piercing for almost 14 years and had never had a single issue with it before I put these in.,6349,1
6349,Be careful if you have sensitive skin.,6349,1
6350,"Cute belt, but it smells so bad!",6350,1
6350,The smell is completely overwhelming.,6350,1
6350,"I would describe it as somewhere between the smell of a chain-smoker's attic and a dirty litter box I hung it up in my bathroom to air out, but it just ended up making my bathroom smell equally as terrible.",6350,1
6350,I can even smell it from my bedroom.,6350,1
6350,"Like I said, very cute in appearance, but I doubt I'll ever be able to wear it because after hanging up for 3 days it has only managed to make everything around it small equally as bad.",6350,1
6350,Very disappointed.,6350,1
6351,I don't often just flat out return something to Amazon.,6351,1
6351,I returned this.,6351,1
6351,Flimsy.,6351,1
6352,Not what I expected.,6352,1
6352,"Very small, and poor quality.",6352,1
6353,Missing the mittens,6353,1
6354,This dress is way to short.,6354,1
6354,I would not be caught wearing this dress to the mall and definitely not church.,6354,1
6355,Way too small and I orderedap size up.,6355,1
6355,Smelled funny as well.,6355,1
6355,Not impressed.,6355,1
6356,"I am not sure ""who"" these right would fit, very tiny and not worth it to return them so may use in a craft project.",6356,1
6357,garbage.,6357,1
6357,turned it on and it was half lit.,6357,1
6358,Not maternity tops,6358,1
6359,Small!!!,6359,1
6359,You have to be super skinny to fit on that thing.,6359,1
6360,It was too large.,6360,1
6360,It didn't fit me at all like I'd imagined.,6360,1
6360,I also didn't know that it was backless.,6360,1
6360,The description didn't state that fact.,6360,1
6360,It will be returned.,6360,1
6361,I only have this one star bacuae I had to l. I don't give it any stars.,6361,1
6361,It was way too small.,6361,1
6361,I ordered XL and looked like I got XS.,6361,1
6361,The stitching was way off.,6361,1
6361,Looked like it could maybe be used as a Halloween costume.,6361,1
6361,I threw it away.,6361,1
6361,I think it came from China.,6361,1
6361,Not even worth the money to send it back.,6361,1
6362,In the picture it looks like they are  thigh high socks but they really aren't.,6362,1
6362,I could get these socks at Walmart for like thirty cents.,6362,1
6363,For being 28 bucks is ridiculously priced to the fact that there kid sizes not close to be women's,6363,1
6364,Biggest scam ever.,6364,1
6364,Don't wait your money.,6364,1
6364,The product I received is nothing like the product shown.,6364,1
6365,Not American size.,6365,1
6365,Rethink about getting this,6365,1
6366,"Don't waste your money, I am normally an xl sometimes xxl.",6366,1
6366,I ordered a 4x after reading other reviews.,6366,1
6366,"The 4x fits like an xl and the fabric is cheap and unflattering, reminds me of something I made in home economics class.",6366,1
6366,The zipper broke upon trying the dress on for the first time.,6366,1
6366,It's made from very cheap materials.,6366,1
6366,I do not recommend this dress.,6366,1
6366,On top of the way it is sewn it's not a flattering dress at all.,6366,1
6367,Strange fit on boob area.,6367,1
6368,"Low quality, smaller than expected.",6368,1
6369,one of the most terrible purchases i've made.,6369,1
6369,i should've listened to the reviews - i'm a size 4 so i ordered a medium and this dress still hugged me in all the wrong ways - doesn't look at all what the picture portrays..the fishtail skirt is ugly and looks cheap!,6369,1
6369,will be returning.,6369,1
6370,Cheap junk.,6370,1
6370,Get what you pay for.,6370,1
6371,Not satisfied at all!!,6371,1
6371,This robe is very thin and feels like paper... this is supposed to be a Christmas present but I'm embarrassed to give it as one!,6371,1
6372,it is very smal,6372,1
6373,"When others stated that this dress runs small, they were not kidding.",6373,1
6373,It runs EXTREMELY SMALL!!,6373,1
6373,I'm so disappointed because the dress is absolutely beautiful and would have been perfect for my event.,6373,1
6374,advertised for larger heads but only normal size gave them to a normal sized head friend,6374,1
6375,Item is not as pictured.,6375,1
6375,It is not made well and too small.,6375,1
6375,I got a large and it would only fit like in the picture if you are an anorexic ten year old.,6375,1
6375,"Also, the company is in China and did not want to deal with sending it back and refunding it but wanted to give me 2 bucks and keep the garment.",6375,1
6376,Way too small...advertised as larger.,6376,1
6377,I purchased this as a gift for a friend who just became a US citizen.,6377,1
6377,She had it on for all of 5 minutes and it just fell apart.,6377,1
6378,Highly breakable - looks cool for 5 minutes until you sit down and it breaks because your thigh flexed,6378,1
6379,The material is cheap,6379,1
6380,Wow!,6380,1
6380,I have never experienced ANYTHING like this before.,6380,1
6380,So I received my order and as put it on I noticed that the short are fine but the part that goes over your chest is sown on the side of my left leg...not even in front or back.,6380,1
6380,Who makes these rompers?!?,6380,1
6380,So disappointed!,6380,1
6380,Will probably have to cut the bottom so I can wear as dress instead of romper.,6380,1
6380,Poorly made.,6380,1
6381,Really cheap quality material and buttons do not work.,6381,1
6382,Sizes are not true to chart.,6382,1
6383,"Maybe my piercing was done weird, but couldn't fit it in my industrial, the anchor isn't adjustable so you have to hope it fits right.",6383,1
6383,Lame,6383,1
6384,Looks really nice and pricy in person BUT I'm a Tall white American Man and the face of the watch is the size of a quarter.,6384,1
6384,What a let down.,6384,1
6385,It turned my ears black and caused them to infect within a few days.,6385,1
6386,I hated it this shirt was stained,6386,1
6387,These socks were sized at 12-14 mens and I wear size 13.,6387,1
6387,They are cutting of my circulation to my feet and I am going to seek a refund.,6387,1
6387,They took over two weeks to get them.,6387,1
6387,A true health hazard!,6387,1
6388,Way to small even for a kid,6388,1
6389,I ordered two pink earrings and received one pink and one green.,6389,1
6389,The green one is not very pretty.,6389,1
6390,"It is really short if you are over 5'5"".",6390,1
6390,I'm donating this.,6390,1
6390,Not worth the effort to return.,6390,1
6391,Very very very cheap made.,6391,1
6391,Almost see through.,6391,1
6391,Not impressed.,6391,1
6392,"waaaay too small, even for my small head.",6392,1
6393,I broke the same day I got it.,6393,1
6393,"First the moon fell off the chain, which I thought would be an easy fix.",6393,1
6393,"Although, I decided to wait until I got home from work to fix it.",6393,1
6393,"Within an hour, the chain's latch broke off.",6393,1
6393,Total waste of money.,6393,1
6394,"Top fit everywhere, however support for the ""girls"" was non-existent.",6394,1
6394,Had to return,6394,1
6395,This product does not fit how it is advertised.,6395,1
6395,The pants is discoloured and the top is pink and though ordered small came way to big.,6395,1
6395,Not a good buy.,6395,1
6395,If you're considering don't.,6395,1
6395,It's not worth your time and money,6395,1
6396,If it's very awkward.,6396,1
6396,The back is way too low,6396,1
6397,Too short and big on top.,6397,1
6398,Rough edges on stamped-out hoops; unpleasant texture to handles.,6398,1
6398,I don't trust it on my face.,6398,1
6398,The case is quite nicely made.,6398,1
6399,Sent back,6399,1
6400,Way too small,6400,1
6401,This shirt is awful!,6401,1
6401,"It is really short, fits strangely though the arms, and really looks nothing like the photo.",6401,1
6401,"I am thin and ordered the large to make sure it fit loosely like the photo, and though it fits it looks nothing like what it is suppose to, would not recommend anyone to purchase this.",6401,1
6402,Just no,6402,1
6403,it looks nothing like the picture.,6403,1
6403,After waiting over a month for it to ship.,6403,1
6403,Not worth it!,6403,1
6403,will post pics soon.,6403,1
6404,The picture shows a kid.,6404,1
6404,"And the product I received is more apt for a large man, rather than my 7-year-old who is big for his age.",6404,1
6404,"This is supposed to be one size fits all, but that is not the case.",6404,1
6404,"Otherwise, it could be a cute, even functional, hat for a large person.",6404,1
6405,"I reorder my dress due to it being too small this is my mistake of course, rather than exchange I just bought it again in a new size because my event was fast approaching.",6405,1
6405,"The first dress I received was beautiful, quality material.",6405,1
6405,The correct color.,6405,1
6405,The second one I received was not even close to the description and the image.,6405,1
6405,"It's supposed to be burgundy its dirty red, and the material is cheap and almost shinny.",6405,1
6405,I'm so disappointed I thought I found a great dress and my first one was.,6405,1
6405,The second one was terrible.,6405,1
6405,Mot only that I paid extra to have it shipped by last week it arrived late and my event is now in two days which means I'll have to wear the tacky thing Moral of the story.,6405,1
6405,Size 16 in burgundy is not the move the image on the left is the original gown,6405,1

6430,"I was really excited about this dress, I just got it out of the bag and put it on.",6430,1
6430,It is quite possibly the ugliest dress I have ever seen.,6430,1
6430,The color is more light denim than the picture shows.,6430,1
6430,I thought it would be a nice light cotony dress for the summer but it is heavy and has a heavy lining.,6430,1

6439,I order 3 different colors from this necklace for presents.,6439,1
6439,The reason I'm giving only one star is because when I ordered them the description said 925 sterling silver ( I attached the picture of my order).,6439,1
6439,Well I was very disappointed when I received the necklaces and they were not silver!,6439,1
6439,"I'll be honest , they do look good but I fell mislead.",6439,1

6442,Not at all what it looks like in the picture horrible quality but you get what you pay for I guess lesson learned never buying from here again,6442,1
6443,Forget the size chart.,6443,1
6443,"If you normally wear a size XXSmall, than get the XLarge.....that is if you don't mind wearing a stiff cotton bed sheet.",6443,1

6443,"I can't believe they can get away with selling this, as it looks nothing like the images.",6443,1

6443,Try putting a belt around it and you will look like a double bubble.,6443,1
6443,"Since I have no idea how to, or patience to, return this and the black one I bought, I decided to wash them to see if they would shrink even smaller.",6443,1
6443,The white one shrunk in width and the black one shrunk in length.,6443,1
6443,"I wouldn't have paid $1 for this, had I known what I'd receive.",6443,1
6443,That's just my experience....who knows what you might get.,6443,1
6443,"Oh, and my white one has a chest pocket only, the black one has 2 round waist pockets.",6443,1
6443,This was just a $15 grab bag experience.,6443,1

6446,Wished I had waited until I  could have gone to a retail outlet to shop.,6446,1
6447,First of all the color they come in doesn't match the one in the picture.,6447,1
6447,Second of all the quality of the product is unexplainably poor.,6447,1
6447,It looks as though I've picked them of the streets.,6447,1
6447,"Very dirty, and the fur comes off at places.",6447,1
6447,"And thirdly, They are no where as cute as in the picture.",6447,1

6447,There's no way I'm putting that cheap stuff on my baby.,6447,1
6447,Not even worth half of the price.,6447,1
6448,This chain is Fake.,6448,1
6449,The fabric is a much cheaper fabric then seems to be shown.,6449,1
6449,Also the front hangs downward much more than in the picture.,6449,1
6449,Not happy at all with this sweater.,6449,1
6449,It's cured me from shopping on line for clothes anymore!,6449,1

6484,"While is is pretty, the armholes are so incredibly large that you can see well below where your bra sits.",6484,1
6484,I ordered a small btw.,6484,1

6487,I gave it to my 90lb coworker and it fits ok on her.,6487,1
6488,The watch took almost 2months to be received and fell apart when I was trying to set the time,6488,1

6526,This dress is not at all as it appears in the pictures online.,6526,1
6526,It is much longer than shows.,6526,1
6526,It also looks like a garbage bag with wings.,6526,1
6526,"The cuffs are cheap elastic bands to hold the sleeves on, however when you raise your arm slightly the sleeves fall off leaving the elastic cuff exposed.",6526,1
6526,I don't think the dress I got is the same dress in the pictures.,6526,1
6527,This is not a woman's size.,6527,1

6547,Horrible.,6547,1
6547,Sizing has to be for a cat.,6547,1
6548,sent back way too small,6548,1
6549,"Frankly, a piece of junk.",6549,1
6549,"It is a tight high neck tank top, with an irregular ""cape"" badly attached.",6549,1
6549,"To give you an idea of size, I can wear a WalMart large tee shirt and have it be baggy.",6549,1
6549,"I ordered an XXL, and it fits tight.",6549,1
6549,"The stitching around the neck is puckered in most places, but not all, so you know it is not intentional.",6549,1

6552,Extremely disappointed.,6552,1
6553,I need to return this capri pants,6553,1
6554,Turned color after less than a week,6554,1
6555,It's a little too big for what I wanted and it definitely feels like PU leather rather than real genuine leather.,6555,1
6555,It's going back...,6555,1
6556,Arrived very quickly (paid for expedited shipping).,6556,1
6556,Beautiful upon first glance but expected the ribbon used to lace up the corset to be black like pictured but it was bright blue.,6556,1
6556,This ribbon is also sewn so poorly that no matter how you lay it it shows ugly seams...,6556,1
6556,Both things are irritating but I would normally not give a bad review but the thing I can't just over look is the fact that there isn't even the same amount of loops on each side to lace it properly.,6556,1
6557,I wore mine in the pool 3 times for about 2 hours.,6557,1
6557,"However, during the 2nd hour of the 4th time a hole develop.",6557,1
6557,I removed them and found the other was tearing away at the stitching.,6557,1
6557,Very disappointing.,6557,1
6557,I love the material and did not get a tan on my toes.,6557,1
6558,Wore it for 2 weeks.,6558,1
6558,"It's green and scratched up, but it looked great when it arrived.",6558,1
6558,"All stones are pretty, in tact and sturdy, the metal is just very cheap",6558,1

6560,This dress is awful!,6560,1
6560,"Seams are sewn wrong, material thin and one arm is longer than other!",6560,1
6560,I knew it wouldn't be great but thought it was something I could work with to make look ok.,6560,1
6560,Went in trash- wasn't even worthy of donation!,6560,1
6561,Zipper pull broke the second time I used it and there is a hole in the left pocket.,6561,1
6561,I ordered one size bigger than normal and it is still too small,6561,1
6562,Costume material,6562,1
6563,Very disappointed in poor quality of these.,6563,1
6563,No arch support and feel flimsy.,6563,1

6566,"I wear a 1-2 x, ardered a 4x, and it is maybe a xl on a good day.",6566,1
6567,Didn't like it.,6567,1
6567,Turned my neck all green.,6567,1
6568,Smelled awful!,6568,1
6568,Too small!,6568,1
6568,Cheap made.,6568,1

6570,"When i opened the package the color is not like what is pictured, in fact when you look at it and touch the material it feels like pijamas or a giant onesie.",6570,1
6570,"I tryed it on, and I can tell you that it fits small, and since it is pieces just stitched together there is no shape to it, so your breasts are squashed, I said ok then i can wear it open with a shell inside, however the zipper does not stay open halfway, it either slides down or you have to zip it all the way up (the zipper is very poor quality.",6570,1

6641,If you have any sort of chest or move your arms much when you workout this bra just comes undone.,6641,1
6641,I'm not a large individual but these bras were just awful.,6641,1
6641,The quality is extremely poor and the sizing is inaccurate.,6641,1
6641,I put one of the bras on my thin boyfriend and they wouldn't even hold together on him!,6641,1
6642,I wish I had read the previous review on this item because it is spot on.,6642,1
6642,The screen print is VERY poor quality.,6642,1
6642,You can barely see the words.,6642,1
6643,purchased a size XL because it says it runs small bottom area is way too tight and the chest area fits like a size small,6643,1
6644,Looks like a long fruit of the loom t-shirt.,6644,1
6644,UGLY!!!,6644,1
6644,!,6644,1
6645,Clasp broke first time wearing it.,6645,1

6647,"I put the product on once and it started falling apart, so I had to sit down and stich it back together and I am not exaggerating.",6647,1
6647,Both the top and bottom fell apart.,6647,1
6647,"Poor quality, the only reason why u didn't return was because I needed it the next day and it somewhat fit.",6647,1
6648,Just like the one I order for her sister to small and I am very disappointed doesn't deserve any stars,6648,1

6654,I love the colors.,6654,1
6654,"I'm 5'5'', 140lbs.....I ordered a medium and they were not quite long enough.",6654,1
6654,The other problem is the moment I did a squat they tore on the backside (not a huge tear but a tear that will prevent me from being able to wear them).,6654,1
6654,They did not feel tight but the crotch did not feel right - I think that is where the problem lies.,6654,1
6654,They could be really good pants but something with the way they are sewn does not fit right nor does it allow the material to stretch as needed.,6654,1
6655,The part that screws on to the ring gets unscrewed and they fall off.,6655,1
6655,I have lost 3 tops already.,6655,1
6656,"So the balls were all the same and right, but that's the end of it.",6656,1
6656,"The bar lengths are all different, and only one was actually the 20g they were all supposed to be, the other three were 16g.",6656,1
6656,"So disappointed since I didn't catch the different sizes until this week and I shoved them in my ears right after receiving them, expecting 20g, thinking it was painful and awkward since the holes were newly pierced and still swollen.",6656,1
6656,"No, the bars were too thick and too short.",6656,1
6657,Horrible fit and quality,6657,1
6658,The ear piece broke away from the glasses part when my son took them off the first time he put them on.,6658,1

6658,"Just a defective pair; however, I don't have time to wait for a replacement one.",6658,1
6658,Need them in a week.,6658,1

6661,Made for an infant!,6661,1
6662,I don't like the way the  material was after I washed it.,6662,1
6663,Beautiful!,6663,1
6664,It was rather small and the pouch is super small.,6664,1
6664,Needless to say it doesn't fit the whole package if you catch my drift.,6664,1

6668,Was hoping that wouldn't happen.,6668,1
6668,Bernie 2020.,6668,1
6669,Extremely small.,6669,1
6669,My daughter is tiny for her age and couldn't fit into the shirt.,6669,1
6669,She was so disappointed because she loved them.,6669,1
6669,I tried to return them for a bigger size and they wanted me to pay for shipping to return them!,6669,1
6669,If they let me exchange them without charging me over and over again I would have gave it 5 stars but when your clothes run way way too small and then you charge shipping for returns that is a rip!,6669,1
6670,I had to return this top.,6670,1
6670,The sequins were sewn on poorly and they were cutting into my armpits when I put my arms down.,6670,1
6670,The stitching along the neckline was uneven.,6670,1
6670,I was disappointed since the top looks so pretty in the picture.,6670,1
6671,The cord pulled out of the end as soon as I opened it and tried to put it on.,6671,1
6671,Garbage.,6671,1
6671,The clasp is also way too big and heavy.,6671,1
6671,It always turned around and ended up at the bottom.,6671,1
6671,I no longer wear it.,6671,1
6672,I returned this item,6672,1
6673,Nope... Did not expectations the handle broke within two weeks,6673,1
6674,"These were great, at first.",6674,1
6674,They're super cute and my daughter loved them.,6674,1
6674,"However, after several months--less than a year!--my daughter began complaining of her feet being wet when she wore these and the insides would get drenched.",6674,1
6674,At first I thought this was bc she was splashing and getting water in the boot over the edges but after watching her carefully I realized that couldn't be it.,6674,1
6674,"Upon closer examination, I found that the boots had cracked along the seams on either side of each boot, letting water just pour in and rendering them completely useless as rain boots.",6674,1
6674,"One might say that if I'd gotten a few months of use out of them, I'd gotten my money's worth.",6674,1
6674,"I'd say that considering we live in California (in a long term drought) and my daughter had worn these fewer than a total of *maybe* 20 days, I'd say I'd been seriously shortchanged.",6674,1
6674,"I did give them two stars because they were adorable while they lasted, but no more bc at the rate a toddler's foot grows, my daughter should have been able to outgrow these long before they failed in their purpose.",6674,1
6674,Very disappointed!,6674,1
6675,I can't get it over my shoulders.,6675,1
6675,It should have fit.,6675,1
6675,I weigh 150& wear a size 12/14,6675,1
6676,Return item,6676,1
6677,The skirt and cape both were damaged.,6677,1
6678,Very Poor quality workmanship - raw edges of material not hemmed.,6678,1
6678,"I usually wear a small, but ordered a medium to be safe, still too small.",6678,1
6678,"I returned this item, not worth the cost!",6678,1
6679,Long delivery time.,6679,1
6679,"Super tight fit for my 6'3"" 250lb frame on the XXL sized shirt.",6679,1
6679,Always have had XXL shirts and never had any this small.,6679,1
6679,Giving to my daughter but I also read the logo will melt in high heat.,6679,1
6679,So will be careful,6679,1
6680,"This dress came to me three sizes too small, wrong lace, wrong fabric, and too short!",6680,1
6680,It is so cheaply made.,6680,1
6680,Please do not waste your money on this tragedy!,6680,1
6681,I did not like at all don't waste your money,6681,1
6682,Way too small,6682,1

6686,Ordered a 2x and it was way too small.,6686,1
6687,Huge neck diameter for the shirt.,6687,1
6687,Logo is much smaller than in picture.,6687,1
6687,Also more of a light blue shade than white from using as little ink as possible to print the shirt.,6687,1
6687,Was probably one size smaller than a normal shirt.,6687,1
6688,This shirt was ridiculous.,6688,1
6688,I expect a certain amount of differences between what's pictured and what I get when ordering from Asia.,6688,1
6688,But this looked nothing like the picture.,6688,1
6688,It was incredibly short and there is no conceivable way for the shoulders to stay up.,6688,1
6688,Tossing it in the goodwill pile :(,6688,1
6689,Absolutely useless for bigger cup sizes.,6689,1
6690,Not like the photo.,6690,1
6690,Mine looks like a fur ball in an awkwardly large globe.,6690,1
6690,Also very cheap quality.,6690,1
6691,I bought it for the back of my dress and it didn't hold at all.,6691,1
6691,Sorry.,6691,1
6692,Very bad materials the plastic clasp broke the first time I tried to put it on my son,6692,1
6693,I just recently moved up to wearing mediums and this was way too small!,6693,1

6693,"Don't even get me started on the bottoms, I can't even wear them!",6693,1
6693,"I really just wanted it for the top anyway, but still!",6693,1
6693,You get what you pay for...definitely wouldn't order from them again!,6693,1
6694,Turns black with just one use.,6694,1
6694,Waste of my money.,6694,1
6695,I can't complain for the price...but I will get another strand somewhere else.,6695,1
6695,Looks cheap and knots in between pearls show...pearls too small...strand too short.,6695,1
6696,I should have read the reviews closer before purchasing this product.,6696,1
6696,It was extremely small in the bust area even though I bought one size larger than I normally wear.,6696,1
6696,Its cheaply made and I am very disappointed.,6696,1
6697,bad material,6697,1
6698,Disapointing,6698,1
6699,"Fits well, but is very cheaply made.",6699,1

6702,Very disappointed.,6702,1
6703,"It was damaged...all the tags were ripped off the top & bottom, so I don't even know if it was the right size.",6703,1
6703,The hanger straps were ripped too.,6703,1
6703,What the heck?,6703,1
6703,The invoice is terrible - no description or item # listed & I could barely read it.,6703,1
6703,Very disappointed.,6703,1
6703,"Doesn't deserve a star, but had to in order to send this comment",6703,1
6704,"The outfit didn't look like the photo, the skirt was extremely long and the outfit was cheaply made wasn't satisfied at all!",6704,1

6802,"The lining is not full length, nor is the skirt ""long maxi"" for me (I'm 5ft.",6802,1
6802,"2 or less, 118 lb)---it's more an ankle length.",6802,1
6802,"I was confused about the use of the words ""slim fit pleated expansion.""",6802,1
6802,(maybe all the skirts under the heading Expansion Skirt aren't actually that).,6802,1
6802,"I was thinking maybe the skirt had a partial expandable or elastic waist, which could be somewhat forgiving, but not so.",6802,1
6802,It would be really smart to call or email the owner of the shop and ask questions---give your dimensions.,6802,1

6919,"The neck was way to high compared to the picture, and my arms were very tight.",6919,1

6924,"I am size 12 in pants i order XXL, the pants are very small, the top is very big!",6924,1

6926,I have washed it three times and I can't get the odor out.,6926,1
6926,In my opinion it is ruined.,6926,1
6927,The necklace is very heavy.,6927,1
6927,So heavy that it broke from its own weight from the back.,6927,1
6928,"Whatever size you are, order atleast a size bigger.",6928,1
6928,Nice shirt and material for the money,6928,1

6929,"Love the look and style, but not for this body.",6929,1
6930,"super thin, cheap and tight.",6930,1
6930,don't do it unless your body is a 10.,6930,1
6931,Smaller than expected and made out elastic material,6931,1
6932,The material of the dress is bad.,6932,1
6932,The dress is SUPER long.,6932,1
6932,I ordered S and the dress is like an XL.,6932,1

6935,I'm very disappointed because as as soon as I saw this I fell in love and had to have it.,6935,1
6935,"It looks like a nice pale sea foam greenish/ teal, like a pastel right?",6935,1
6935,"Nope, it's apparently a shocking, vibrant, noisy bright bright teal, which makes it stand out too much.",6935,1
6935,"It's much cheaper material than it looks; the ruffles aren't the same as in the pic, and the 'waist' is much higher, basically right under the breast line, which was my biggest issue.",6935,1
6935,"Then the dress is too long, it's not knee length, which isn't a big deal but that's what I was hoping for.",6935,1
6935,"It runs small, and was too tight in the chest area.",6935,1
6935,"I'm very disappointed, I haven't even worn it once since I bought it and tried it on.",6935,1
6935,I guess that's the risk we take sometimes buying clothes online.,6935,1

6944,Very small!,6944,1
6944,!,6944,1
6945,Ordered a 4x because of small sizing.,6945,1
6945,Usually wear an XL and it fits like a medium or large.,6945,1
6946,even after washing this fabric bleed all over my white sheets!,6946,1
6946,HORRIBLE material,6946,1
6947,This item was horrible.,6947,1
6947,I ordered a Small and it fit like a large.,6947,1
6947,I tried it on and my 5 year old son laughed at me.,6947,1
6948,I am very disappointed in these shirts.,6948,1
6948,"I got my order today and these shirts are extremely short, at least an inch shorter than other 2T shirts I've bought for my son.",6948,1
6948,"I took pictures as a comparison, the shirt on the left/bottom is Carter's brand size 2T.",6948,1
6948,"As you can see the width is fine, the length is significantly different.",6948,1
6948,"The quality of the shirt is as expected, not an extremely soft blend, but not a cheap rough fabric.",6948,1
6948,Based on sizing alone I cannot recommend these shirts and would not order again.,6948,1
6949,The arches are to high so it made my heels hurt more.,6949,1
6950,Pretty color very roomy.,6950,1
6950,Catchy material.,6950,1
6950,Returned,6950,1
6951,waste of money,6951,1
6952,I don't know what I was expecting with the price being so low for a bag full of barbells.,6952,1
6952,"I love how flexible they are and the coloring is fantastic, however the threading on the bar to hold the balls on is terrible.",6952,1
6952,"The ends pop right off very easily, which makes these horribly dangerous and surely a choking hazard, do NOT use these as a tongue ring.",6952,1
6952,They would be better suited for eyebrow.,6952,1
6953,"This is a truly unflattering, uncomfortable and so not true to size, i am actually mad I fell for the hype.",6953,1
6953,"These pants are for people with small waists and large hips and thighs, tho the waist does not stretch so I do not know how people would get it over their thighs.",6953,1
6954,Bad quality and size was not as described,6954,1
6955,This arrived in terrible shape.,6955,1
6955,"The shipping box was perfect but the costume packaging inside was filthy, it had definitely been opened and returned.",6955,1
6955,The costume itself was very poor quality.,6955,1
6955,"As other reviewers have said, the paint on the chest piece and belt was terrible, it looked to of been done by toddlers.",6955,1
6955,The foam pieces were creased and cracking.,6955,1
6955,"The body suit was sheer, the cape was shorter than pictured and had no hem at the bottom, just a piece of mis-cut fabric with 2 pieces of velcro to fasten it.",6955,1
6955,The velcro was placed so close together it didn't even fit halfway around my neck.,6955,1
6955,There was also no mask in the package.,6955,1
6955,I am returning this to Amazon and I hope they don't try to send it out to someone else since I obviously received one that had been previously returned.,6955,1
6956,Don't waste your money...these scissors are worthless they don't cut anything.,6956,1
6956,"I work in an ER and I need something that's sharp and can cut clothes, these are not them!",6956,1
6957,"It bulges and gives my body Wales it's uncomfortable , wasted my money ,haven't used if after three wearings",6957,1
6958,Loved but Brooke First time I used,6958,1
6959,Ordered a large.. fit like an extra small,6959,1
6960,"Great text, poor quality t-shirt",6960,1
6961,"cheap dress
horrible fit
bad customer service",6961,1
6962,The WonderWoman charm didn't even last 2 days.,6962,1
6962,I would not recommend buying this.,6962,1
6963,These pants fit as expected which is a miracle in itself.,6963,1
6963,"Hard to find 35"" waist.",6963,1
6963,Will be ordering more in the future.,6963,1
6964,Really cheap material.,6964,1
6964,I will never purchase any more of this brand.,6964,1
6964,It's a really poor product.,6964,1
6965,"Don't purchase this item in ""purple"" if the color purple is truly what you want.",6965,1
6965,I am disappointed and rather angry because this item is not only plum rather than purple but the item in it's entirety is nothing like the photo.,6965,1
6965,Not only are the roses PLUM but the back ground is a dark dull gray rather than white or light grey as it's depicted on the product page.,6965,1
6965,I can't even detect the stems on the roses that are suppose to be green.,6965,1
6965,There is a distinct difference between the colors plum and purple  that the average person can discern.,6965,1
6965,"Thus, one would expect a company that manufactures and sells products in various colors to know that difference.",6965,1
6965,"Therefore, to label this as purple is, to say the least, a  misrepresentation.",6965,1
6965,The curtain is also pretty thin so I'm not impressed with the manufacturing of the item either.,6965,1
6965,"With shipping and handling, I paid $19.99 for mine.",6965,1
6965,I received it 16 days after placing the order.,6965,1
6965,"The company I received this item from was ""Happy_Store Storefront""  and apparently is located outside of the USA so returning the product would be too costly.",6965,1
6965,"Therefore, I have no choice but to keep it an give it away.",6965,1
6965,Now I'll have to search again for a appealing purple shower curtain and hope that  it is indeed purple when it arrives.,6965,1
6966,It broke when I tried to adjust it.,6966,1
6966,"It was not tight, but the metal strips in front just fell apart.",6966,1
6966,"There are no pearls on it, rather it's a shiny metal (a little heavier than tin) mimicking rhinestones.",6966,1
6966,I  didn't get to wear them .,6966,1
6966,"Waste of money, sadly.",6966,1
6966,They looked much better in the picture.,6966,1
6967,Garment arrived late.,6967,1
6967,Fits small.,6967,1

6969,Didn't work.,6969,1
6969,You get hwat you pay for.,6969,1
6969,Stay away from this brand of hats.,6969,1
6970,"Order two, never received the other.",6970,1
6970,Don't bother,6970,1
6971,"FALSE ADVERTISING....LOOKED LIKE AN OLD T SHIRT

7152,This dress was a bad fit for me.,7152,1
7152,I am pear shaped.,7152,1
7152,"Because the measurements listed only stated the waist & bust measurements, I assumed (wrongly) that the bottom half had a bit more room than the top.",7152,1
7152,This dress is straight from top to bottom.,7152,1
7152,"So, if you purchase by your bust measurement, and you're bottom heavy, this will look bad or fit snugly.",7152,1
7152,"Unless I got one that was poorly sized, I would disagree with people saying in ran large.",7152,1
7152,"The size small fit my top half perfectly, and I fall right in the size range according to the listed measurements.",7152,1
7152,"Perhaps those that thought it ran large are large busted, and the bottom half was too big?",7152,1
7152,"I was also not thrilled with the light purple color I bought, it was a muted shade and didn't suit my skin tone.",7152,1
7152,"One final note- if this is a tighter fit on you, it shows every little imperfection.",7152,1
7152,It's that kind of fabric that requires smoothers or a fit body underneath.,7152,1

7155,The toe area is way too long for the size.,7155,1
7156,Son refused to wear them after one try - Very slippery.,7156,1
7157,The  'Corset' is cheaply made and as a size 24 won't stay fastened since the right side is completely Velcro and once again the cheap velcro.,7157,1

7170,Feels like construction paper and honestly isn't what we all expect.,7170,1
7170,Learn from my mistake it's not worth it.,7170,1
7170,"Bad material, horrible sizing, doesn't look as cool as I imagined.",7170,1
7170,It smells like clothes at least otherwise it's trash maybe a good night time sweater for when I feel like sleeping dress as Bill Cosby.,7170,1
7170,Don't bye friends,7170,1
7171,This item was way to small.,7171,1

7186,"Anyway, this one showed up with crooked collar... as in it was only about 6 inches long, and then was more centered on the left side of the neck... the right side was totally cooked.",7186,1
7186,"Also, when the jacket hung - down the front of the chest, the right side was longer... LONGER than the left.",7186,1

7200,It is thick material and does not drape like the picture.,7200,1
7201,Way too big,7201,1
7202,"I was expecting what the picture represents, not just one single scarf.",7202,1
7203,Looked cheap nothing like the picture,7203,1
7204,Small and very cheap quality,7204,1
7205,Has a weird seam right down the middle of the front and back which makes it look cheap and feel awkward on.,7205,1
7205,If it wasn't for that it would be cute.,7205,1
7205,Also runs small.,7205,1
7206,This necklace was BROKEN when I OPENED IT!!!,7206,1
7206,The piece itself was adorable!,7206,1
7206,I was very disappointed!!,7206,1
7206,!,7206,1
7207,As soon as I saw the dress thru the plastic bag I knew there was a problem.,7207,1
7207,The quality is absolutely terrible.,7207,1
7207,The polka-dots are painted on and basically see through (a sign of poor quality).,7207,1
7207,I wouldn't even buy this for 50 cents at a garage sale!,7207,1
7207,Very hesitant to purchase anything else with this label.,7207,1
7208,This is probably the worst Amazon purchase i've made.,7208,1
7208,The material is super cheap.,7208,1
7208,The lace is barely hanging together.,7208,1
7208,I ordered a 3x to be sure it fit.,7208,1
7208,I generally wear a 1-2x.,7208,1
7208,This top is more like an adult L. Pitiful!,7208,1
7209,"Doesn't fit right, way to tight in the arms.",7209,1
7210,Came broken.,7210,1
7211,"Not really what is advertised, headline said ""sweatshirt"" previously and this is just a teeshirt.",7211,1
7211,The headline has since been changed.,7211,1
7211,Printing is of high quality and looks to be sublimation.,7211,1
7211,Actual teeshirt is the strange blend of cotton and something else.,7211,1
7211,"Reminds me of a ""stay dry"" golf shirt almost.",7211,1
7211,I suspect this is the blend that has to be used for the new sublimation print that this shirt was printed with.,7211,1
7211,The size is why it gets 1 star.,7211,1
7211,"This wasn't advertised as a kids size, but it's so small that I would suspect it is.",7211,1
7212,Don't waste your money.,7212,1
7213,"Not what I had expected, to big!",7213,1
7214,Junk discolored,7214,1
7215,Cheaper than watches found in swap meet for $5!,7215,1
7216,I wish that I had read the reviews before I bought this.,7216,1
7216,"I have had no problems with any other bikini I bought fitting, but as the others before me have already said, the bottom fits about two sizes too small and the top fits perfectly.",7216,1
7216,I would return it but have a bottom that goes okay with it from another bikini.,7216,1
7217,I ordered a large and they were to small wow waste of money only because they didn't fit,7217,1
7218,Way too long and large.,7218,1
7218,"Requested a refund, but vendor is slow to reply.",7218,1
7219,I made the mistake of assuming if I ordered a 5-piece set that the pizza would be cut into 5 pieces so that when put together it would make a whole pizza.,7219,1
7219,Nope.,7219,1
7219,It's a pizza cut into six slices so when they put their  pieces together there is a piece of the pie missing!,7219,1
7219,(???),7219,1
7219,What is the point of that??,7219,1
7219,Guess I'll tell them God completes the circle even though they can't see Him.,7219,1
7220,"Contacted seller ages ago never received a reply, the pant split at the rear seem almost immediately after wear and wash, material is to thin.",7220,1
7221,The pic looks like the navy blue shirt is angled..longer on one side the the other....not so.,7221,1
7221,The material is very thin but that really isn't a deal breaker just be very careful if you wash it.,7221,1
7221,It runs 2 sizes too small....not what I bargained for.,7221,1
7221,The neck line has pretty embroidery but tossed into it is gaudy cheap plastic glued on beads.,7221,1
7221,"Too many negatives add up to ""send it back"" for me.",7221,1
7222,The dials are fake.,7222,1
7222,They are just stick on.,7222,1
7222,The only things that is real is the day and day of the week roll.,7222,1
7222,Should not call this full calendar,7222,1
7223,Ordered 12 only received 8,7223,1
7224,"Everywhere thread out, very bad Aroma such as from the basement!",7224,1
7224,Inside pocket a lot of thread  from product different color!,7224,1
7225,I order the dress small and it's little big on me .,7225,1
7225,No true to its size,7225,1
7226,Not what I ordered.,7226,1
7226,I particularly chose to order this product because I thought it was cuter than the other fox hat available.,7226,1
7226,Attaching a photo of what's on order vs what I received.,7226,1
7226,"Different color, different ears, no whiskers and no tail.",7226,1
7227,"This is not a sweatshirt nor is it hooded, nor is it XL.",7227,1
7227,Very disappointed.,7227,1
7227,It is a thin small tshirt.,7227,1
7228,The buttons on the pocket pop off the back sleeve ripped very cheap material I do not recommend any one to buy .,7228,1
7229,The XL fits my 6 year old......ridiculous,7229,1
7230,Not what I ordered at all...,7230,1
7230,"It's a tin sign to hang on the wall, dimensions 8"" x 12"" not a license plate... Made in China shipped from China, there aren't even 50 stars...",7230,1
7230,"Very cheap tin arrived bent, disappointed.",7230,1
7231,There is padding in the top but the deep v would require a special bra or going without.,7231,1
7231,Zipper in the back.,7231,1
7231,"The slit in the pic looks cut but as I saw with some of the personal pics, once you get it on, it really would have been a better design with no slit at all as depending on your frame you might not be able to stand let alone sit without flashing the world.",7231,1
7231,I'm 175 and a 36c and I ordered a LG that fit just fine.,7231,1
7231,"However, if they closed the slit and removed the pads I probably wouldn't have sent it back.",7231,1
7232,This bracket broke the first night I wore it.,7232,1
7232,I was sad,7232,1
7233,Top is way too big and baggy maybe my boop are just too small but the bottom don't fit was the pic,7233,1
7234,A little small but had stains or dye where it should not have and it took two weeks of back and forth to get some of a refund.,7234,1
7235,Bought it for my daughter and she loved it.,7235,1
7235,Arrived sooner then expected...,7235,1
7235,It tarnish weeks later..,7235,1
7236,Do not like the quality of this license plate.,7236,1
7236,It's more of a burnt red then anything else.,7236,1
7236,Not pleased at all,7236,1
7237,Cheap cheap cheap.,7237,1
7237,The lining is incredibly noisey it sounds like a newspaper.,7237,1
7238,I don't like it at all its was a  waste of money  I only wear it once,7238,1
7239,fell apart the first time I tried to put it on- very poor quality :(,7239,1
7240,The sections are disproportionate to one another.,7240,1
7240,It came with several tears in various places.,7240,1
7240,"Not to mention the odd stains, don't buy this product.",7240,1
7241,"Size incorrect
5.5 should be 16.10 in diameter,
the received ring is 16.97 mm",7241,1
7242,"Came late, the head weighs more than the body so it leans forward.",7242,1
7242,"Also way bigger than expected, not impressed",7242,1
7243,It is the size I wear and I was a kids size when I received it,7243,1
7244,This hat totally sucks.,7244,1
7244,The price is rediculously high for an item that u cant wash AND it gets cotton balls on it after a few times of wear,7244,1

7245,"But, it already ripped :(",7245,1

7247,Why don't you show more pictures so we can see exactly what we are buying?,7247,1
7248,Didnt deserve a star....Too small....size seemed to be made for a child - cheat finish around the waist band,7248,1
7249,"Less then 60 days after purchase, a wire on the top of the bag popped out and now stabs me whenever I use the bag...",7249,1
7249,Contacted seller and was told the bags are only warranties for 30 days.,7249,1
7249,Who the hell has an issue within 30 days?!,7249,1
7249,Would not purchase again.,7249,1
7250,Way to small and I got an XL not meant for tall curvy women.,7250,1

7255,Nothing like it looks in the picture.,7255,1
7256,was not as expected can not use,7256,1
7257,The shoulder pads are oversized.,7257,1
7257,It makes the jacket misshaped.,7257,1
7258,Did not fit a C cup and was not easy to put on.,7258,1
7258,Ended up throwing it out and having to switch dresses 15 minutes before a wedding.,7258,1
7258,"If you are larger than a B, I would not recommend",7258,1

7271,I bought the seas a gift for my husband.,7271,1
7271,He loved them but only after two months they had a hole in them!,7271,1
7271,For the cost they should last longer,7271,1
7272,Would be great if they included the mask...,7272,1
7273,To start the dress came with a black stain on the lace.,7273,1
7273,And is not black and white as it appears to be.,7273,1
7273,It's more of a black and peach.,7273,1
7273,Also dress is not cut for women with larger chest size.,7273,1
7273,I ordered a size larger then I usually do and it is still very tight across the chest.,7273,1

7277,I pay in full price for it.,7277,1
7278,Too small,7278,1
7279,poor quality but what could i expect for a dollar,7279,1
7280,"The pattern is very cute, however the garment is wide and very short.",7280,1
7280,I am 5'3 125 lbs.,7280,1
7280,I read the reviews online and sized up in hopes that the waist would elongate.,7280,1
7280,Even the Xl was too short in the torso.,7280,1
7280,The garment was then very uncomfortable because it pulled heavily up the crotch.,7280,1
7280,I could not even give it away because no one could fit in it.,7280,1
7280,DO NOT BUY.,7280,1
7281,these run about 2x bigger than normal women's plus clothes.,7281,1
7282,I was very disappointed with these leg warmers.,7282,1
7282,They were extremely small and I ended up giving them to my young granddaughter.,7282,1
7283,"We received black raun coats, not the ones pictured.",7283,1
7283,Just kept them bc of the hassle and time constraints on returning.,7283,1
7284,Was WAY bigger than I expected and the clasp was very hard to open and close.,7284,1
7284,I've never been able to wear it.,7284,1
7285,I reserved the wrong product colors did not match order that had be placed.,7285,1
7285,The over all quality was poor at best I will not be shopping from this company again.,7285,1
7286,Larger than expected.,7286,1
7286,"When it arrived, it had a terrible fishy smell to it.",7286,1
7286,I guess it is the material.,7286,1
7286,"I'm still letting it air out for three days, so I'll update if the smell never goes away.",7286,1
7286,"It was wrapped well when it arrived, the handles were each covered and the whole thing was in tissue paper.",7286,1
7286,"I got the coffee color, and it is just how it looks on the screen.",7286,1
7286,"Update:
Six months later and about half a bottle of febreeze later, this still smells horrible.",7286,1
7286,Like rotted garbage and putrid fish.,7286,1
7286,"Every time I open it or get close to the inside of it, I get a huge whiff of pure stink.",7286,1
7286,I guess it is the chemicals used to dye it.,7286,1
7286,This is a shame because the purse itself is nice and I would really like to love it.,7286,1
7286,"It looks nice, is roomy, has good pockets, but the odor is just too overwhelming.",7286,1
7286,Such a shame.,7286,1
7287,nothing like the picture,7287,1
7288,horrible.,7288,1
7288,i ordered 2x... couldn't even fit my sister who is a medium.,7288,1
7289,side poles that attach to ear will not hold the ear.,7289,1
7289,the earrings keep coming off,7289,1
7290,The size is very too large and the color of the A ( alvin) is not yellow but orange...,7290,1
7291,Runs VERY small and I even ordered a size larger,7291,1
7292,I received them all bent.,7292,1
7292,They sit super crooked and are just flat out molded wrong.,7292,1
7292,"They are really cheap, no wonder it was only $10bucks.",7292,1
7292,You get what you pay for .,7292,1
7293,Tiny and cheap looking fur,7293,1
7294,Arrived after a long time with a hole in it.,7294,1
7294,So cheep I didn't want to hassle a return.,7294,1
7294,Would have liked it were it not ruined.,7294,1
7295,These pants were much too small for the size that I ordered.,7295,1
7295,"I could stretch them to fit, but then the material was thin and you could see through them and it made the colors look much lighter than when they are not being worn.",7295,1
7295,There is a reason these pants are so cheap.,7295,1
7295,I would not recommend!,7295,1
7296,Would not recommend this jacket to anyone.,7296,1
7296,"It is very cheaply made, looks nothing like the picture, did not fit right at all.",7296,1
7296,And the entire inside lining of the jacket came apart the first time I washed it.,7296,1
7297,Broke after one week of use.,7297,1
7297,Caused my watch to fall onto the ground.,7297,1
7297,Don't buy,7297,1
7298,"Horrible quality, looks nothing like the picture.",7298,1
7299,"WAY to small, and you cant really see the logo on the back.",7299,1
7299,Plus it has extra ink in spots on the shirt.,7299,1
7299,I want to send it back.,7299,1
7300,Cheaply made.,7300,1
7300,The button already came off.,7300,1
7301,"Tried it on, it fit great but started peeling off.",7301,1
7301,Returning it.,7301,1
7302,"When the watch, I quickly realized that the movement was much more bulky than I realized.",7302,1
7302,I  also quickly realized that the time is quite difficult to read when outside during the day as I had to shade the watch so that I could see the lights that tell the time.,7302,1
7302,"When I took it out on the water it quickly stopped working even though it had only gotten wet a few times over the course of an hour, so it's definitely not waterproof.",7302,1
7302,"I bought this watch specifically because it said it was waterproof, so that's pretty much a dealbreaker for me.",7302,1
7303,Ordered plus size and gave it to my daughter who wears a size Small.,7303,1
7303,Too small is an understatement.,7303,1
7303,Looks great on her though.,7303,1
7304,Got this thinking it would be good for my  infant or toddler.,7304,1
7304,But the size goes to large it infact fits my head.,7304,1
7304,Secondly it's cheap material... And seems like made from all the waste knitting yarn by some apprentice and to hide the defaults some paw like cut cloth stuck on the side near the ear.,7304,1
7304,Yes...it was stuck with glue not stiched.,7304,1
7304,Definitely not a good one.,7304,1
7305,This item does not fit oversized like the photo at all.,7305,1
7305,You will need to be 5 ft tall and order a L or XL to get the look as pictured.,7305,1
7305,"The pockets are not full sized pockets as shown, they are just for looks.",7305,1
7305,"You cannot fit your hands or even fists into them 100%, they are faux, mini pockets that a baby's hand could maybe fit into.",7305,1
7305,I am normally a Medium and I ordered this top in size Large and it was very small and short.,7305,1
7305,"If I'd know how small it ran, I would've ordered up 2 sizes.",7305,1
7306,Most cheaply made dress I've ever seen.,7306,1
7306,Contacted the company and got my money back.,7306,1
7306,The dress went into the garbage,7306,1
7307,Not what I needed.,7307,1
7308,a little to small,7308,1
7309,Shoulder straps had to be cut down 4 inches and it cost more for the alterations then it did for the dress.,7309,1
7310,Turned my belly button green.,7310,1
7310,Come to find out it was infected.,7310,1
7310,The ring turned blackish a couple days later and was extremely painful,7310,1
7311,Ordered XL.,7311,1
7311,Fit closer to a Medium than an XL.,7311,1
7311,Extremely short.,7311,1
7311,Came in an 8 X 10 envelope that felt virtually empty.,7311,1
7311,Almost paper thin material.,7311,1
7311,Nothing AT ALL like the photo.,7311,1
7311,Really was laughable.,7311,1
7311,"Extremely fast shipping if there was a positive aspect, but fast shipping of such a disappointing product is of no value.",7311,1
7312,I ordered an XL.,7312,1
7312,Did not fit AT ALL.,7312,1
7313,Broke after just a couple of times wearing gently not worth the money!,7313,1
7314,Is not like the picture once I received it I was disappointed it looks like I just bought it at the flea market the material is cheap,7314,1
7315,Difficult to clasp and cheaply made,7315,1
7316,Definitely need to order a size up.,7316,1
7317,Item was too small and the image was completely faded.,7317,1
7317,"Horrible quality, would not expect this from Amazon sellers.",7317,1
7318,Wasn't close to actual size,7318,1
7319,To small to short on picture it's at the lady knees.,7319,1
7319,When I put it on it's right under my butt.,7319,1
7319,I'm not a street walker or a whore.,7319,1
7319,So I can't wear this dress very very disappointed.,7319,1
7319,"I don't think I will ever order from this company,waste of my money.",7319,1
7320,I order an XL.,7320,1
7320,most XL fit and are a little baggy.,7320,1
7320,Large's fit really well in most.,7320,1
7320,Since it was a shape wear might as well get a little bit and have it fit.,7320,1
7320,Well this thing was a X Small and it wouldn't even fit in on leg.,7320,1
7320,I wish this was regular sized cause I would love to have this in my wardrobe.,7320,1
7320,Order a few sizes up,7320,1

7324,Disappointed.,7324,1
7324,The top is ok.,7324,1
7325,It was suppose to be Medium,7325,1
7326,snaps came off with first wearing,7326,1
7327,horrible material.,7327,1
7327,Scratchy.,7327,1
7327,ordered xl barely fit my 11 year old.,7327,1
7328,Very poor quality material.,7328,1
7328,It was very itchy and could not wear it for more than a few mins.,7328,1
7328,"I did not bother with the returns, but this is definitely going for trash.",7328,1
7329,"If you're wanting to buy a cute bodysuit to match your skirt or something similar, it's a good idea, but I'd keep looking.",7329,1
7329,I received my body suit with a black mark on the front so I'm very disappointed with that.,7329,1
7329,The material isn't very thick so white is extremely see-through but I guess I should've expected that since it's white.,7329,1
7329,It buttons in the crotch area but the plastic scratches you.,7329,1
7329,"I'd say keep looking for a better bodysuit, this is not worth it.",7329,1
7330,Good Heavens!,7330,1

7330,ZERO Stars!,7330,1
7330,"I purchased for a Pebble Steel, width is right but I can't use the band since it only uses a standard stem to mount properly.",7330,1
7330,I went to local Walmart and found similar bands for about $1.00 more and of course they were all accompanied by the usual mounting stems.,7330,1
7330,"None with tis and for 7 bucks, not worth the trouble to return.",7330,1
7330,But non the less very annoying that I can't use it,7330,1
7331,I thought this was going to be all different sizes of the earring because that's what it seems like in the picture.,7331,1
7331,Slightly disappointed because it was only one pair.,7331,1
7331,May return.,7331,1
7332,Very bad quality not worth the money,7332,1
7333,The design is extremely fuzzy.,7333,1

7334,Broke the first time my girlfriend put it on.,7334,1
7335,"Didn't like, were to large.",7335,1

7337,I just contacted the seller today 8/27/16 and received the order from USPS today.,7337,1
7337,Order was placed August 3rd 2016,7337,1

7344,"I would avoid this seller in the future, it is difficult to return items.",7344,1
7345,I didn't do anything,7345,1
7346,Only used the Umbrella about 5 times and two of the sections came off the spines.,7346,1
7346,I used super glue to try to glue back on but do not know if the sections will stay on.,7346,1
7346,This was without any wind.,7346,1
7346,So far I have not had any wind when I used the umbrella.,7346,1
7346,I would not recommend purchasing the umbrella.,7346,1
7346,Update: the latch to close the umbrella started not working very well about a month ago and today it broke.,7346,1
7346,Definitely do not waste your money on this umbrella.,7346,1
7346,For the record the super glue worked.,7346,1
7347,You get what you pay for.,7347,1

7351,"One of them was missing the rings on them, none of the sizzles are labeled and I'm pretty sure I'm missing either the 8g or 10g.",7351,1
7351,Do not order this if you expect to receive everything you need.,7351,1
7352,Poorer quality than expected.,7352,1
7353,The padding on this bra is so stiff and doesn't fit to form.,7353,1
7353,It also shows through all the clothing.,7353,1
7353,I had to pull out the padding of these and use the padding of another bralette to even be able to wear this thing.,7353,1
7353,"The space on the sides of the bra by where the straps are attached, also open up during wear and of course it's visible under clothing, it appears like an odd bulge or crease underneath.",7353,1
7354,This bathing suit was dirty and gross and could not fit anyone in my family including my skinny 16 year old niece.,7354,1
7354,They wouldn't let me return it so I threw it away.,7354,1

7368,It looks great on her.,7368,1
7369,This does not fit as pictured.,7369,1

7438,Smells like burlap.,7438,1
7438,I got a XXL.,7438,1

7438,Dont waste you money.,7438,1
7439,Unless you have a very flat chest or they are still youthful and perky this is not the top for you...,7439,1
7439,It's cute though.,7439,1
7440,does not fit properly.,7440,1
7440,"it smushes things down and makes them pointy when looking sideways, and the stick peels off after a few minutes and the side ravel up.",7440,1
7441,The color was not good & it appeared to be inexpensive... don't waste your time & money...,7441,1
7442,"Very cheap material, and bad quality, don't buy it.",7442,1
7443,It is definitely not an item to buy.,7443,1
7443,It's soooo cheaply made and broke apart the first day I wore it.,7443,1
7443,Never even considering again,7443,1
7444,"Not so good, the dress was made poorly with no care.",7444,1
7444,"It was sewn crookedly in two different places, and the stripes don't even line up evenly.",7444,1
7444,I was very excited about this but now im not happy at all,7444,1
7445,Picture did more justice to it.,7445,1
7445,It's UGLY AF.,7445,1
7445,I haven't worn it and it's still hanging in my wardrobe.,7445,1
7445,UGLY AF!!!,7445,1
7445,The centre pleats are not aligned and are puffy.,7445,1
7446,Poor quality,7446,1
7447,It is really small and the meterial doesn't look all that great either.,7447,1
7447,I'll have to  give it to someone who could fit it or give it up as donation.,7447,1
7448,Not as pictured.,7448,1
7448,It's much shorter and looks even cheaper than it was.,7448,1
7449,Cheaply made,7449,1
7450,Bought two of these.,7450,1
7450,Because i liked the first once sooo much.,7450,1
7450,My mother wanted one.,7450,1
7450,"First one i absolutely loved, second was a whole size smaller.",7450,1
7450,Very disappointed with seco d purchase,7450,1
7451,Horrible fabric.,7451,1
7451,Looks like a trash bag,7451,1
7452,Update:  this thing just keeps getting worse.,7452,1
7452,"Every time I wash it (delicate cycle, no dryer) another seem tears..",7452,1
7452,I spend more time resewing this that.,7452,1
7452,Actually wearing it.. down grading from 3 stars to one..,7452,1
7452,In no way was this worth $25.,7452,1
7452,$15 at the most.,7452,1
7452,"And yes I got authentic ""bepei""

Pros
Great color saturation.",7452,1
7452,I got the green.,7452,1
7452,Think rich yet dark.,7452,1
7452,Real nice.,7452,1
7452,The cut is heaven.,7452,1
7452,I'm 5foot6 and wear a 16.,7452,1
7452,I got the XXL and it was definitely the right size for me.,7452,1
7452,it stops at the bottom of my butt.,7452,1
7452,Perfect fit and flare.,7452,1
7452,Very comfy.,7452,1
7452,The feel of being in PJ's yet you look cute.,7452,1
7452,"Cons
Material is thin.",7452,1
7452,Not like a sweatshirt.,7452,1
7452,More like a regular stretchy soft cotton.,7452,1
7452,Almost jersey knit.,7452,1
7452,I'm a curvy girl and its not very forgiving (mine isn't tight at all but when it got cold it was easy to tell by looking at my chest if you know what i mean.).,7452,1
7452,There were 3 stitching defects I see immediately.,7452,1
7452,The pouch isn't sewn on all the way.,7452,1
7452,The cuff stitching missed the fabric in a spot and there's something funky on the hood I can't quite figure out.,7452,1
7452,The draw strings are coming unraveled already I tied them to try to stop it.,7452,1
7452,The neck line is sewn weird on the inside but this time on purpose.,7452,1
7452,I can't explain but if you buy one youll see what I mean immediately.,7452,1
7452,"It kinda makes you say ""huh?""",7452,1
7452,Basically I think this price point is way off.,7452,1
7452,To say an original price of $45!?!?,7452,1
7452,That'd be robbing someone to be frank.. $25 is still too high for what you're getting.. at.,7452,1
7452,$10 - $15 I'd fix the holes by sewing myself and never mention it - heck I would probably get another one at that point.,7452,1
7452,But no way at $25.,7452,1
7453,Really bad,7453,1
7454,Itchy and ill fitting,7454,1
7455,Much bigger than they were supposed to be.,7455,1
7455,On of the jewels fell off before they could be worn.,7455,1
7455,Not worth the time or effort to return.,7455,1
7456,Fitness weird.,7456,1
7456,Basically big all around despite me using the size guide.,7456,1
7457,It fell apart after an entire 5 minutes.,7457,1
7458,"It is NOT a polyester cotton blend, it says on the package 100% polyester.",7458,1
7458,It is cheaply made and will probably rip as soon as I put it on.,7458,1
7458,DO NOT BUY,7458,1
7459,Sleeves way to long and the blouse in general has a weird fit.,7459,1
7459,Not nice,7459,1
7460,Very pretty but absolutely will not stay in place with either earring backs provided.,7460,1
7460,Always hangs down and doesn't look right.,7460,1
7461,This always falls off the shoulder.,7461,1
7461,I will consider a style with a higher back.,7461,1
7462,I usually wear an XL but I decided to purchase an XXL because I thought it would run a little small.,7462,1
7462,To my credit I was right.,7462,1
7462,The XXL was tighter than a L is on me.,7462,1
7462,I cannot wear it.,7462,1
7463,Chain broke the first day,7463,1
7464,had to return-too small,7464,1
7465,Highly too small.,7465,1
7465,Looks more like a bra.,7465,1
7466,I ordered this set and the hats look nothing like the ones pictured.,7466,1
7466,The picture made them look very colorful and fancy.,7466,1
7466,These are completely different from what I've received.,7466,1
7466,The only reason I kept them is because I needed hats for my daughter's Easter hat project.,7466,1
7466,"If u are looking for fancy hats, do not buy these.",7466,1
7466,These are just like the straw easter hats I've seen in the dollar store.,7466,1
7466,Not worth the price.,7466,1
7467,They came broken.,7467,1
7468,The picture on my monitor is really peach.,7468,1
7468,The jacket I recieved is much pinker and darker and the dyeing is much more distressed looking.,7468,1
7468,"The material already has pills, and looks old even though it has tags.",7468,1
7469,I love the suit!!!,7469,1
7469,Fits really well...,7469,1

7475,The hat was very small and did not fit like it is shown in the picture.,7475,1
7476,Doesn't  live up to the picture.,7476,1

7478,"The arms have a rubber type finish on them, for grip, I am assuming.",7478,1
7478,"They fit snugly on my face and the nose pads were secured to the frame, they are black so these are all around black glasses.",7478,1
7478,"There is a slight smell to the item, but honestly, I expected that.",7478,1
7478,"The rubber on the arms is where it originated from, hopefully it dissipates.",7478,1

7565,The design on line looks like they slide over your tie and shirt.,7565,1
7565,Which seems like a cool design until you they arrive and you try it on.,7565,1
7565,The clips are so tight that there is no way a tie or a shirt can fit in between them.,7565,1
7565,"Cool idea, horrible execution.",7565,1

7573,Better fit for a woman with a short torso.,7573,1
7574,"The fabric is thick and hard, it does not flow like the picture.",7574,1
7574,Everyone said to order a size bigger I did and it's huge.,7574,1

7575,she's 4 months & still doesn't fit her !,7575,1
7576,Beautiful color but the structure at the top is all wrong.,7576,1
7576,Almost like the straps are too short because the cups your breasts would usually fill are practically at my clavicle.,7576,1
7577,This product is not as described.,7577,1
7577,Will be sending out back.,7577,1
7577,The material is thin an very cheap looking.,7577,1

7594,Very poor quality wallet.,7594,1
7594,Not worth what I paid for it.,7594,1
7595,I received on Jan 6th and the zipper already broke and stitching came out.,7595,1
7595,Nice leather.,7595,1
7596,I am a size 7 or 9.,7596,1

7602,"I had to give these away, no one is thin enough to wear these.",7602,1
7602,"I only weigh 120, but they were very unflattering",7602,1

7605,This shirt is not an authentic Simply Southern shirt.,7605,1

7606,"Nice color, thin material,  some strings hanging..",7606,1
7607,This top is cute and fits well.,7607,1
7607,"However, the pants are a different story.",7607,1
7607,These pants are just weird.,7607,1
7607,I'm not sure who these would fit.,7607,1
7607,The way they are put together gives a pooch effect and no one wants that!,7607,1
7607,Get this outfit at your own risk.,7607,1
7607,Or just because you like the top.,7607,1
7607,The pants are unwearable!,7607,1

7610,Nothing how they look at the picture.,7610,1
7611,Very uncomfortable.,7611,1
7611,Did not like at all,7611,1
7612,Picture is deceptive.,7612,1
7612,The text looks like it's a piece of paper that is placed on the charm.,7612,1
7612,A large glob of clear glue sits on top of the paper.,7612,1
7612,Mine arrived with a large scratch across the glue making it hard to read the text.,7612,1
7612,Sending it back as it's only going to get worse.,7612,1
7613,Way too small and not enough stretch,7613,1
7614,To small.,7614,1
7614,Seams do not line up .,7614,1
7614,Pockets are in the front!,7614,1
7615,I had to give this a way.,7615,1
7615,I ordered a large and I am a size 8.,7615,1
7615,Couldn't even get it over my head.,7615,1
7615,Gave it to my friend who is a size 2 and it didn't fit her either.,7615,1
7616,Cheap material...my daughter has used it for school since September and it is coming all to pieces.,7616,1
7617,"Cheap material, poor fit, looks nothing like modeled suit.",7617,1
7618,This ring is HORRIBLE.,7618,1

7619,This bracelet is NOT large as described.,7619,1
7619,"If anything, it maybe be large for a small child.",7619,1
7620,it is really cheap looking-i am a big marlyn monroe fan-i truly love her-but this handbag just looks so cheaply made-,7620,1
7621,"Putting the strings of this together will take all day, cheap material and customer service skills lacking for sure.never ordering from here again.",7621,1
7622,Missing stone when I received.,7622,1
7623,I can honestly say I wish I didn't purchase this purse.,7623,1
7623,"It looks cheap, feels cheap and I will not carry it.",7623,1
7623,I'm not someone who buys purses from high end stores.,7623,1
7623,I usually purchase from Target.,7623,1
7623,So it's not as if I'm expecting a high end purse for a low price.,7623,1
7623,I would not have even bought it for $5.,7623,1
7624,"Returned this product, VERY poorly made.",7624,1
7624,"There is ZERO support in bust area, basically just orange flimsy cotton.",7624,1
7625,They don't stay on your ear like that,7625,1
7626,This was way to small!,7626,1
7627,Do not order this dress!!!!,7627,1
7627,It's very cheaply made.,7627,1
7627,It looks like u are wearing a t-shirt under the dress that is popping through the neck line.,7627,1
7627,The edges of the dress are made out of a cotton t-shirt type of material that does not mesh well with the dress.,7627,1
7627,I wasted my money on this dress because I will not be wearing it.,7627,1
7627,I'm not going to bother with the return because it would cost me more money and time to send it back to China.,7627,1
7627,It also took over a month to arrive.,7627,1
7627,I was very disappointed with the product!,7627,1
7627,I will never order from a third party again.,7627,1
7627,I definitely learned my lesson.,7627,1
7628,Not a cute too.,7628,1
7628,I usually wear a small and this shirts colors are not why it looks like on the site.,7628,1
7628,It looks really cheaply made.,7628,1
7629,Too small,7629,1
7630,Very very cheaply made.,7630,1
7630,Can't even wear it.,7630,1
7631,See through material.,7631,1
7631,Cannot adjust to make too tighter.,7631,1
7631,Material is not really bathing suit quality.,7631,1
7632,Super cute.,7632,1
7632,"Bigger than I expected it to be, but still cute.",7632,1
7632,Update: The rose has fallen off.,7632,1
7632,It was barely glued on by the edge.,7632,1
7633,I was really excited to get this dress.,7633,1
7633,"What I got was a shirt, so not very happy.",7633,1
7634,I normally wear a women's Medium or Large so I ordered a Women's XL just to be safe.,7634,1
7634,"When it finally arrived almost two months later, the vest smelled awful, and is so small that it literally fits my small seven year old sister.",7634,1
7634,"I get that Chinese sizes run super small, but C'MON.",7634,1
7634,Don't advertise that these are Women's sizes when they are so small that they can only fit small children!,7634,1
7635,This shirt could have been so cute.,7635,1
7635,II'm short and petite and I thought it would look cute for the gym.,7635,1
7635,Instead it's an awkward fit.,7635,1
7635,"It shows the belly, is tight at by the arms, once you get to the middle and bottom it's really loose.",7635,1
7635,It looks like I am wearing a kids dress!!,7635,1
7635,Its not your average top.,7635,1
7635,Waste of money I'll never wear this outside the house.,7635,1
7636,Description says 100%cotton.,7636,1
7636,It is NOT!,7636,1
7637,"This looks great, but the temple arms fell off in less than a week.",7637,1
7637,Very low quality material.,7637,1
7638,"Cheap, get what you pay for",7638,1
7639,"Size was ridiculous,  way to small for a 3x more like a small will never order from them again.",7639,1
7639,I guess.,7639,1
7639,I got what I paid for.,7639,1
7640,"I ordered this for my teenage daughter, who is a dancer and very slim.",7640,1
7640,The description of the sizes is not accurate.,7640,1
7640,The material reminded me of her dance leotards and it looked like a tent on her.,7640,1
7640,She chose this for the pattern which looks better in the picture than on the actual dress.,7640,1
7640,Based on the description the Asian small is equal to a U.S. xs.,7640,1
7640,In my opinion it fit like a small on my daughter.,7640,1
7640,"If you are a true xs, and very thin this dress will not fit you.",7640,1
7640,It is being returned.,7640,1
7641,Dress is not true size!!,7641,1
7641,Can't even get over your head,7641,1
7642,Very cheap and bad made,7642,1
7643,"Bad fit, poor quality",7643,1
7644,"Ordered large size, received XXL!!",7644,1
7644,"Has a stain on collar, I don't like the material of the pocket too- cheap plastic material.",7644,1
7645,I've had this purse 3 days and the clip for the shoulder strap snapped.,7645,1
7646,Initially thought it was a great bag until the zipper broke.,7646,1
7646,Lacking a sturdy zipper is a huge flaw.,7646,1
7647,"This shirt smells, the fabric is thin and scratchy, the seams are coming apart, threads everywhere.",7647,1
7647,Terrible in every sense.,7647,1
7648,It looked like it was made for a 9 or 10 year old.,7648,1
7648,from the armpit of the shirt to the bottom was 13 inches.,7648,1
7648,who's chest and stomach is only 13 inches long?,7648,1
7648,plus NO room for breasts.,7648,1
7648,So that made it even smaller.,7648,1
7648,No where near the size I expected.,7648,1
7648,I ordered a small because every other t-shirt I've ever bought I can fit smalls.,7648,1
7648,I suggest getting a large if you plan on buying one and you fit a small.,7648,1
7648,Just looked nothing like the product picture.,7648,1
7648,the words and brain on the shirt was dark and faded as well.,7648,1
7648,VERY unhappy with this.,7648,1
7649,Not good metal!,7649,1
7649,Made nipple sore & hurt!,7649,1
7650,This is not a Pandora there's no homework from Pandora it's flat it's not like an apple and the CZ's in the leaf are clear total rip off I would like my money back,7650,1
7651,Doesn't deserve the 1-sta!,7651,1
7651,"VERY Disappointed in product being far from the pic, size ordered, color & scheme, etc.",7651,1
7651,"This product took over 40 days to arrive due to availability; then, it arrived with a big let down.",7651,1
7651,"What Woman wouldn't be excited to see a package at her door, after work, anticipating it has this pictured sweater.",7651,1
7651,"The outfit I had planned with my awesome Kate Spade saddle-colored boots (thanks, Amazon) will have to be disassembled (not really a big to me- the sweater was b/c I liked how it looked in the pic for sale with the jeans and boots & necklace).",7651,1
7652,Nope!,7652,1

7654,"I measured it and it was 39"" or so.",7654,1
7654,"I ordered a different similar belt, plain buckle.",7654,1
7654,"It also said 49.2"", and it's fine.",7654,1
7654,"Just don't order the Skull belt if you need larger than a 38"" belt....",7654,1
7655,"All different shapes, no different sizes.",7655,1
7655,"I can't even use these for replacement balls, sadly, 100% useless to me.",7655,1
7656,This was not a large this would fit a 5 year old small child!!,7656,1
7656,!,7656,1
7657,Broke the first time used.,7657,1
7658,This dress is practically made of paper,7658,1
7659,Yikes.,7659,1
7659,Looks REAL cheap.,7659,1
7660,"Even though the listing says 2 day shipping, apparently that doesn't matter to Amazon anymore.",7660,1
7660,Second time I have ordered something recently on a time constraint and they failed to deliver.,7660,1
7660,"Not sure if it is the manufacturer's fault or Amazon's, but I ordered these a week before dance class started and they didn't arrive.",7660,1
7660,Had to go out and buy some the day of class and Amazon would not refund these so I am stuck with these.,7660,1
7660,"Didn't know much about dance shoes, but I can tell you that the quality of the ones I ordered on Amazon do not even compare with the ones I bought for just 10 dollars more elsewhere.",7660,1
7660,I don't recommend these.,7660,1
7660,"They are very papery, hard canvas and look very uncomfortable.",7660,1
7660,The color is sorta very pale beige and not pink at all.,7660,1

7663,too small and very see through!,7663,1
7664,Fake leather,7664,1
7665,Thisis crap nothing like the one on the picture,7665,1
7666,The chain broke the first day worn,7666,1
7667,I was expecting something soft and cotton.,7667,1
7667,What I got was a polyester garbage bag.,7667,1
7667,Returned without trying it on.,7667,1
7668,"They were rose gold, not yellow gold.",7668,1
7668,I immediately returned them.,7668,1
7668,So disappointing,7668,1

7670,Biggest waste of money,7670,1
7671,"I expected a cute little summer dress... Well, it was just above the shapeless splendor of a potato sac, yet the feel of the material- a cross between a cheap plastic shower curtain and a pillowcase- I would've rathered the potato sack.",7671,1
7671,"If I could give this a zero, or negative number, I would.",7671,1

7753,So I will never buy any shoes from here again!,7753,1
7754,"I would've kept it but it looks dim like it's dirty or old and is thin (because I bought the other dress that is the same color but with different back design, and that one's color looks really fresh and is thick and nice material), and it has a weird smell...",7754,1
7754,Size fits fine though,7754,1

7765,Three months later the main zippers were not working.,7765,1

7766,Not worth it.,7766,1
7767,Runs really small...I ordered a size larger and it was extra extra small...I sent back.,7767,1
7768,"After waiting almost a month for delivery, the dress I received was NOTHING like the picture or as described.",7768,1
7768,"It was only midlength and the fabric was a very thin, cheap polyester/nylon and overall ugly.",7768,1

7768,"There was no striped waistband, just elastic smocking along the waist of the black bodice fabric.",7768,1
7768,"It had a scoop neck, rather than a V neck.",7768,1
7768,"The plastic package it was in was not sealed and although the package said it was a size L, the dress was much smaller than that, no bigger than an M.  I expected it to run small as it is Asian sized, but this was beyond just running small.",7768,1
7768,I'm guessing that the dress I received was on that was returned by another customer and put in the wrong package to send it back.,7768,1
7768,"Unfortunately, my fiancee damaged the dress when he cut open the package so I am unable to even return it and hope for the right dress on the 2nd try.",7768,1

7812,I wear 2XL jackets normally.,7812,1
7812,"This jacket didn't fit like a 2xl, a xl, or even a large.",7812,1
7812,This is smaller than comparably asian sizes would have given in 2xl.,7812,1
7812,"Shipping was 6 days late (Ordered on the 11th, claimed package would arrive on the 14th, item arrived on the 20th) Waste of time, But I never return clothing, so donation bins here you go, make SOMEONE happy.",7812,1

7816,"When I received this item, it was missing the standard cardboard logo name brand tag.",7816,1
7816,This pair also obviously smaller in size than the other 39/40 pairs in my possession and the sole is thinner.,7816,1
7816,I believe these to be fake versions of the actual flip flop.,7816,1
7816,"Therefore, these have been returned.",7816,1
7816,Please see all photos of comparison to the other pair received the previous day.,7816,1

7840,Bad material,7840,1
7841,Not only was the XL extremely too small (couldn't even get them on; more like the equivalent of a size 12) but the fabric seemed thin and was more like something you would wind on jogging pants or wind jackets.,7841,1
7841,Sending them back.,7841,1
7842,I bought this for a camping trip for my daughter.,7842,1
7842,It says it's waterproof.,7842,1

7857,"The leg joints, where the glasses frame and legs meet, need to open up 90 degrees so you can wear them and collapse them when you are storing them.",7857,1
7857,It's a straight-forward and simple concept.,7857,1
7857,"However, upon receiving my glasses, I've noticed that the leg joints are both at odd angles so the leg on one side wouldn't even open up and the leg on the other side opens up past 90 degrees.",7857,1

7940,:(,7940,1
7941,Way to small,7941,1
7942,This dress is lovely in the pictures.,7942,1
7942,The straps are way too thin to do all of the styles seen.,7942,1
7942,I would love to wear this dress but unfortunately it is not as I expected it to be gonna have to send it back unless I want my boobs to show.,7942,1
7942,"Other than this detail it showed up as expected, length is perfect, but I can't wear it, I'm only in a c cup and I purchased a large great everywhere else...",7942,1
7943,Horrible,7943,1
7944,Really SMALL,7944,1
7945,Color of stones are not so shiney.,7945,1
7945,The circle one looks like it has black stains.,7945,1
7946,UPDATE - - This was a terrible purchase in the end.,7946,1
7946,The threads came apart and it unraveled in many areas after the first washing.,7946,1
7946,Terrible quality.,7946,1
7946,"I really like this dress, though it arrived extremely wrinkled.",7946,1
7946,Based on the reviews I ordered a 3XL and typically wear a size 14 dress.,7946,1
7946,"It fits well, though a little snug in the chest (I am 38D).",7946,1
7946,It's very low cut in the chest and I will probably be wearing a camisole underneath but my husband says it looks great as is (rolls eyes).,7946,1
7946,"I am 5'10 and like the length of the dress, though the sleeves could be a tad longer.",7946,1
7946,I really love the style and the color so I look forward to wearing it.,7946,1
7946,But it definitely runs very small considering this is a 3XL and I am normally just a Large.,7946,1
7947,Runs too small,7947,1
7948,"AS soon as I tried it on the strap broke off my shoulder, and the top was much looser than expected.",7948,1
7949,Shorts fit but if you have breast that are larger than a C cup don't waiste your time,7949,1
7950,"Totally disappointed, I asked big size but I get a smaller and even looks like the one shown in the photo.",7950,1
7950,I will not buy again,7950,1
7951,Still way too small in the fit.,7951,1
7951,"Construction is ok, but size is way off.",7951,1
7952,These pants were terrible.,7952,1
7952,The seams were falling apart when I took it out of the box.,7952,1
7952,Not sewn correctly at all.,7952,1
7952,The material is also very thin and cheap feeling.,7952,1
7953,Shrank when washed and now too short.,7953,1
7953,Picture does not represent actual product length.,7953,1
7953,From China,7953,1
7954,The skirt fit fine but is way to short.,7954,1
7954,I am 5'6 140 lbs and I ordered a medium so it would be a little loose to meet work dress code.,7954,1
7954,The length is mid calf length.,7954,1
7954,It should be to the floor.,7954,1
7954,Very disappointed.,7954,1
7955,The material of this cover up fits the description of medical gauze that hospitals use on open wounds.,7955,1
7955,It is so ugly and cheap!,7955,1
7956,Beautiful piece but disappointed with the quality  had to buy a second set because I feared it wouldn't stay together for more then one wear.,7956,1
7956,"Earrings very poorly made, one post almost off after only trying on.",7956,1
7956,Bought these for a wedding and needed to be sure I had the full set.,7956,1
7956,My advice is to buy 2 sets just to be safe.,7956,1
7957,Cero,7957,1
7958,"not good, battery sucks, hard to see, broken band",7958,1
7959,Was posted as a women's large and was about the size of a 10 year old.,7959,1

7961,To big,7961,1
7962,I received unscented beads.,7962,1
7963,Very unhappy with my product.,7963,1
7963,The T-shirt is more for a girl.,7963,1
7963,The picture is dark and faded.,7963,1
7963,Like someone just printed a pic online and iron it to a cheap shirt.,7963,1
7964,This is a cheap NOT THERMAL shirt that runs about three sizes small.,7964,1
7964,I tried it on and its so thin its almost see through.,7964,1
7964,I had to return it.,7964,1
7965,Although it is a juniors sizing they fit much smaller than that.,7965,1
7966,Beautiful but the beads fell out the moment I clipped it in my hair,7966,1
7967,If u r going to sell a forged print t-shirt @least have da decency to make it exactly like da original...-5x5 shirt print is a digital copy so faded and small print.,7967,1
7967,"no tag, just a sticker indicating size and no design on da back of shirt.when it showed shipping from China I had a feeling it was going to be a knock off",7967,1
7968,Nice but way too SMALL.,7968,1

7968,Very dissapointed!,7968,1
7968,I'll just give it away.,7968,1
7969,This bag does not deserve a star at all.,7969,1

7970,cheaply made & put together -doesn't fit,7970,1
7971,I am so disappointed I was really looking forward to this bracelet but when I received it it was the wrong size so now I have to try and find a bracelet for my charms I am very disappointed I purchased a size 8 but I received a size 6.5 that could only fit a child,7971,1
7972,Extremely disappointed and have a crushed soon to be 5 year old.,7972,1
7972,This listing is misleading and is considered false advertisement.,7972,1
7972,"You can NOT advertise ""1 pack of 12"" and I order TWO and only receive TWO hats instead of 24!",7972,1
7973,This shirt is awful don't even worry about purchasing this material is spandex also not a tee shirt at all these people falsely advertise I'm giving them no stars I'm 5'6 weigh 110 pounds wear a small I get a large to small and material is not t shirt material it's scratchy and uncomfortable and totally made porly they won't give me my money back I'm willing to return...they don't want it back I don't want it either I paid not a lot of course but still it was paid I deserve a refund in full since I'm willing to return...

7979,Definitely returning!,7979,1
7980,The fit was fine.,7980,1
7980,The material looked cheap.,7980,1
7980,I have  another Ivanka Trump dress that I really like.,7980,1
7980,Because the lace overlay on this dress is mixed with sequins it makes the dress appear to be rubberized.,7980,1

7990,"The dress is completely see-through, super cheap fabric and horrible quality",7990,1
7991,This dress is ugly and the material is horrible!,7991,1

7991,Plus the colors are not the same as shown!,7991,1
7991,"Very cheap, very uncomfortable plus not as large as I would like..",7991,1
7991,"I wear a medium but ordered a large and should have ordered a XL .. Not flattering, Not cute!",7991,1

7999,At least I took some nice pics to my kids,7999,1
8000,"It was nothing I like I expected, it was horrible quality, the padding was not silicone like I had an understanding it would be, and furthermore the padding kept moving.",8000,1
8001,"I followed the sizing chart as suggested, too large.",8001,1
8002,Piece of crap .,8002,1
8002,Broke as soon as I put it on,8002,1
8003,Looks cute online but it very gaudy and cheaply made in addition to being on a super short chain and the elephant being much smaller than its portrayed online.,8003,1
8004,The numbers around the outside of the dial rubbed off within a week.,8004,1
8004,VERY DISAPPOINTED.,8004,1
8005,Beautiful dress if only it was true to size.,8005,1

8010,"flimsy material, NOT a good fit for petite people!",8010,1
8011,It arrived broken,8011,1

8012,"Bought 2 pairs of these, one split right down the butt the first time I wore them, returned for full refund.",8012,1
8012,The other did the exact same thing a week after the 30-day refund window expired.,8012,1
8013,"These are cheap, small, and already the first pair I bought has runs in them.",8013,1
8013,"They are ""stretchy"" but basically like thick tights.",8013,1
8013,"I bought these because I thought they'd be big enough for my legs, I wear a size 16 in pants, but they only go up to my knee and they roll over.",8013,1
8013,Not happy with this purchase at all.,8013,1
8014,"This is an awful product not worth buying it looks like somebody previously purchased the item and removed the comfort lining in the middle that insulates the irritating places where it will rub against the skin and chafe leaving red skin burnmarks, claiming that the shaped form is a padded push up bra, but that isn't the type of format the posture bra is supposed to have offered so you should go back to the Victoria Secret company and stop harrassing people who are seeking to relieve their personal discomfort.",8014,1
8014,"I'm reached the limit of my patience, and if you're wondering why I'm so suspicious is because this person in particular has not ceased hounding the local shopping stores by leaving no remaining suitable sizes because she thinks she's superior in silicone size to other people who simply want to be comfortable and aren't trying to compete for attention but merely seeking proper breathing facilities as well as the immediate end to constant back pain that the assigned medical team has ignored for numerous years.",8014,1
8014,"I know they are reading this because this is yet again another prevention by them in order to excuse their incapability to provide the expert treatment they have advertise to give to other customers, but now they're nervous since they've been paid for over a year and now they know that they will become exposed as fraudulent so they just had to interfere yet another time and I have no more limit for this type of behavior.",8014,1
8014,"If you spent less time deliberately bothering another person by ruining their purchased items then you wouldn't have to feel so embarissed about yourself and just buy the cheaper bra shapers, they're not size increasers but made to not be so obvious which is what you really need.",8014,1
8015,"Transparent, thin, cheap material.",8015,1
8015,And the snaps are not fastening tightly.,8015,1
8015,Would not recommend.,8015,1
8016,"Skirt looked cheaply made, definitely small and short.",8016,1
8016,I'm 5'2 and it was above my ankles.,8016,1
8017,Returned.,8017,1
8017,Sizing is completely off.,8017,1
8017,Super tiny!,8017,1
8018,The ring was broken off from the design.,8018,1
8018,Costs too much to return.,8018,1
8019,Doesnt fit or look as expected,8019,1
8020,Horrible design and fit,8020,1
8021,I got the ring today and it is not at all what I expected.,8021,1
8021,It's very thin and the jewel is not easily recognized as a heart shape.,8021,1
8021,From the picture i was expecting a thicker ring that would stand out as a  Claddagh ring in my ring finger but you can't tell what it is until you get up close.,8021,1
8021,"Also, I have a standard ring size measurement kit which sizes my ring finger as an 8.",8021,1
8021,This size 8 is much larger than the standard and fits on my size 9 middle finger better.,8021,1
8021,I will not be purchasing a ring from this seller in the future.,8021,1
8022,Thisbhat was way to small and very cheaply made.,8022,1
8023,I got this in the mail today with some kind of animal hair all over it.,8023,1
8023,It is not as the picture shows and smells like animals too.,8023,1
8023,I'm so disappointed.,8023,1
8023,I was so excited...,8023,1
8023,I unfortunately was let down by this product!,8023,1
8023,Be careful if you order a skirt from here!,8023,1
8023,I put it outside over night to see if the smell would go away and it didnt!,8023,1
8023,Gross!,8023,1
8023,!,8023,1
8024,Chain was broken when received and the pendant is very dull looking.,8024,1
8024,The stone looks like plastic it doesn't shine at all.,8024,1
8024,Not the best.,8024,1
8025,The color was not at all like the picture.,8025,1
8025,"It ended up being a very deep, dark purple.",8025,1
8025,I was very disappointed.,8025,1
8026,Do not purchase if you consider yourself thick.,8026,1
8026,I wear a size US 15 in jeans and they rollled down my thighs when I was able to get the socks that high.,8026,1
8027,This did not fit the watch it said it did!,8027,1
8027,Would not buy again,8027,1
8028,Small and flimsy.,8028,1
8028,Disappointed on this one.,8028,1
8029,Poorly made.,8029,1
8029,There is already a hole in one pocket and I've only tried it on once.,8029,1
8030,These earrings came tarnished and we're very small.,8030,1
8030,Not what was advertised.,8030,1
8031,I figured this would be longer!,8031,1
8031,Totally disappointed.,8031,1
8031,I'm only 5'3 and it barely goes to the bottom of my abdomen.,8031,1
8032,I so very much wanted to love this purse.,8032,1
8032,And I probably would if it weren't for the fact that it arrived with a white non-removable film along the bottom and a bit in other areas.,8032,1
8032,This appears to have come from the metal that is on the shoulder straps which had a white crusty substance rusted to it.,8032,1
8032,"In addition, if you unlock the clasp and lift up that flap, there's a super dark, circular stain around the metal that is there underneath.",8032,1
8032,What a disappointment.,8032,1
8032,"Love the color and the shape, love that it's a backpack and a nice size, but it's not usable!",8032,1
8032,How somehow could possibly think this should pass inspection before shipping is beyond me.,8032,1
8033,It was nothing like the description.,8033,1
8034,SEE THRU MATERIAL - FITS SMALLER THAN NORMAL,8034,1
8035,I'm giving it 1 star because the XL is too big and the L is too small.,8035,1
8035,I'm 5'6 and only 133 so the sizing is awful,8035,1
8036,Fringe messed up before I even got to wear it,8036,1
8037,Ordered a size bigger because i was expecting it to be smaller.,8037,1
8037,Still way to small,8037,1
8038,"Pretty fabric, but as I learned later it was Asian sizing and very small.",8038,1
8038,Almost like children's size.,8038,1
8039,It came in torn with Bobby pins holding it together on the arms and the beast cups are torn from the dress.,8039,1
8039,!,8039,1

8043,Poorly stitch with a hole in it!,8043,1
8043,!,8043,1
8044,"*BUYER BEWARE*
As with other reviews, I want to leave zero stars but am not able.",8044,1
8044,Wish I would have taken time to read reviews before purchasing.,8044,1
8044,Product had visible mold on the front when it arrived in its clear packaging envelope.,8044,1
8044,Opened the clear packaging to see if mold could be washed out... was immediately overwhelmed by an overflowing musty stench.,8044,1
8044,"Product arrived damp, and when it was unfolded, it was covered in mold.",8044,1
8044,This is unacceptable.,8044,1
8045,"Although I purchased a large, they were still way too small.",8045,1
8045,Unless you are very thin and have no muscles in your legs do not purchase this.,8045,1
8046,Very ugly.,8046,1
8046,Not much like the picture.,8046,1

8051,These are awful!,8051,1
8051,The fit is terrible and the material thin.,8051,1
8051,Save your money!,8051,1
8052,I got this in the biggest size but it runs very small it was so cute to,8052,1
8053,This product is sized ridiculously small.,8053,1
8053,I normally wear an XL in women's.,8053,1
8053,"I ordered the 2x, bc I prefer night wear to fit loosley.",8053,1
8053,"The shirt fits like an adult Medium, and the shorts fit like an adult Small.",8053,1

8054,I do not recommend getting this product.,8054,1
8055,This product a 5X in size is really more like a 1X.,8055,1
8056,Very bad quality and huge in size.,8056,1
8056,I bought this a few weeks ago and it was slightly torn at 2-3 different places.,8056,1
8056,Please do not waste your money/effort in buying this product.,8056,1
8056,I returned it the day I received it.,8056,1
8057,The fabric was as expected but the construction of the garment was of very poor quality.,8057,1
8057,There was bunching around the collar area.,8057,1
8057,The was a hole in the stitching where the tag is located.,8057,1
8057,And the bottom looks like the fabric was cut but not finish (i.e.,8057,1
8057,A hem or something),8057,1
8058,Way too small,8058,1
8059,It'd be a wonderful coat if it came in adult sizes.,8059,1
8059,I ordered a 2xl and it won't even zip over my bust.,8059,1
8059,Is it a 2xl for 14 year old boys?,8059,1
8060,"Fits very small, my 11 year could wear it.",8060,1
8061,Purchased a 2xl and it fits like a small,8061,1
8062,"Shirt completely faded after one wash, can't read anything on it, was purcahsed as a sort of gag gift, but I didn't realize the shirt was a one time use!",8062,1
8062,"Way too expensive not worth it,",8062,1
8063,This shirt looks nothing like the color posted.,8063,1
8063,"It also as poorly made and although they said the sizes run small, they seemed to be ok.",8063,1
8063,"I bought a medium because of the listing of bust size etc, but it was inaccurate.",8063,1
8064,Save your money.,8064,1
8064,You can get a t-shirt and iron on your own letters better then how it was done on this shirt.,8064,1
8064,"The spacing is off and it looks like it says ""Champ Agne"" Campaign.",8064,1
8064,"As for the quality, it is literally iron on letters, and not even the high quality kind.",8064,1
8064,"I saw some reviews that were similar, but disregarded them because the shirt was so cheap.",8064,1
8064,"I guess I am not out that much money, but still.",8064,1
8064,Live and learn I guess.,8064,1
8065,The picture of the product and details are very misleading.,8065,1
8065,Details stated cotton and it isn't.,8065,1
8065,The product is very inferior.,8065,1
8065,Do Not buy.,8065,1

8071,It was too big.,8071,1
8072,don't waste your money.,8072,1
8072,Jacket is paper thin and the material makes you look like you are wearing a trash bag.,8072,1
8072,Came with zippers off track and looks horrible.,8072,1
8073,Is there away to give Zero star....My Goodness paid so much and the texture of the material was like sand paper but really soft....its so thin...I  particularly bought it from a USA store not only to get it quicker but for quality but it says MADE IN CHINA...so disappointed i am sending it back...plus the 8 1/2 please please pleaseeeeeee not 8 the info says fit to size but that was A LIE....Screaming on top of my LUNGS i have to go out and shop for  this item....ughhhhh,8073,1

8075,"Item was not true to size (too small), flimsy quality as well.",8075,1

8077,Way too small.,8077,1
8077,"I got an XL I'm only 5'7"" and wear a size 6,36DD and the cross cross top is so tiny it barely covers my nipples, plus the torso is so short it rides up my crack and gives me camel toe city.",8077,1
8077,But if you're tiny it would be ok!,8077,1
8078,Both my husband and I couldn't figure out how to set.,8078,1
8078,My daughter loved the way it looked but couldn't set the watch for her to use.,8078,1
8079,Child like size!,8079,1
8079,I ordered size larger because it started it runs small....it's childlike,8079,1
8080,size is definitely not standard,8080,1
8081,"Too bulky and can't put it in any pocket, too large to hold , very inconvenient",8081,1
8082,This is a joke.,8082,1
8082,"I'm tall and lean 5'8, size 2 and put this on and it looks like a blouse that is way too large around the middle section but much too short to wear as a bathing suit cover up.",8082,1
8082,The model must be 4'9!,8082,1
8082,I wound up wearing it as a blouse with a cami underneath but it's so wide it looks like a pregnant shirt.,8082,1
8082,Unless you are very short I don't see how this could possibly work as a bathing suit cover up.,8082,1
8083,Can not begin to tell you how wrong this shirt is very very short and wide and sown wired in front itchy color off .,8083,1
8083,Such a bummer,8083,1
8084,My toddler loves these boots from an aesthetic standpoint and loves to wear them in rain and snow.,8084,1
8084,"They have not scuffed easily, which is good.",8084,1
8084,"However, one of the boots has leaked since first wear, causing wet socks.",8084,1
8084,By the second wear one of the little flames up by the calf had torn off.,8084,1
8084,Probably for the better since they kind of irritated the calf anyway.,8084,1
8084,"Cute concept and my toddler does love them, but mom wishes there was a little more quality control on waterproofing these rubber boots for wet conditions.",8084,1
8084,Update: after a few more wears both boots split completely apart (see photos).,8084,1
8084,You can see from the photo of the soles these are barely used.,8084,1
8085,Missing the clasp hook in the back missing patches of sequences.,8085,1

8100,Thank god my aunt is amazing and knows how to sew she had to sew me in the dress I got no pics with my sister or the family because I had to be sewn in the dress!,8100,1

8102,I have thin legs and they fall down.,8102,1
8102,"The seller does not offer free returns, so it is not worth the cost to try to return these.",8102,1
8103,Made with sub par material.,8103,1
8103,No give in the material at all.,8103,1
8103,My husband is an XL but bought a 2XL.,8103,1
8103,Could barely get it over his head.,8103,1
8104,Ordered x large and couldn't get them over my knee..gave them to my 13 year old who is super skinny,8104,1

8106,These shoes are extremely narrow.,8106,1
8106,"My daughter is a size 12 and I ordered a size 13, thinking it would give her room to grow into them.",8106,1
8106,But we're sending theme back.,8106,1
8106,I normally love Sketchers for myself and the kids.,8106,1
8106,"For some reasons, this style is so narrow that they're unwearable.",8106,1
8106,My 5 yo daughter was extremely disappointed.,8106,1
8107,"I don't recommend it to any young adult or any woman, who delivered 7 children,  unless if you have the impression( in your mind), that figure had not changed since your freshman in high school.",8107,1
8108,"After wearing these gloves 3 times, the shiny decorative material on the left hand glove has started to separate from the fleece.",8108,1
8108,"At the place of separation, the shiny material is raveling badly.",8108,1
8108,"Also the ""smart touch"" sensors on the right hand glove are off center so I keep having to readjust the glove to use my phone.",8108,1
8108,Waste of money.,8108,1
8109,"As others noted, they run about half a size large.",8109,1
8109,The 8.5 fit perfectly when I usually wear a nine.,8109,1
8109,"The wood soul on one of the shoes is partially split, but I don't want to deal with the exchange process.",8109,1
8109,"Otherwise these are some excellent, eye catching boots!",8109,1
8109,"Update: After a week of light wear, the seam between the left sole and the leather has started to split.",8109,1
8109,I'm beginning to wonder if these will even last another month before they fall apart completely.,8109,1
8110,I was hoping for a much better quality product and fabric.,8110,1
8110,"After just a few washes (on gentle wash, and gentle, low-temperature dry), these are already ready to be donated.",8110,1
8110,"The arms and legs stretched very wide around the ankle and wrist cuffs, and also shrunk up, length-wise.",8110,1

8120,"this dress is an extra large, but it's far too small for my arms.",8120,1
8120,I can't even get it on.,8120,1

8120,"I'd like to send this dress back, but don't want to pay the postage to do so.",8120,1
8120,It's very pretty though.,8120,1
8121,I did not get what was in the picture.,8121,1
8121,so disappointed.,8121,1
8122,"I have a size 34 inch waist and I bought the largest pair, and it seems like these are manufactured for women too small and no room for your manhood",8122,1
8123,I was very very upset about this buy.,8123,1
8123,The print was done in the middle of the shirt underneath the sleeve the back of the shirts design was pressed in the middle of my back which is rather embarrassing if you wear it in public plus I live on California if I wore this in Venice I probably would get stabbed it's so bad.,8123,1
8124,DO NOT BUY IT.,8124,1
8124,It's soooooo fake,8124,1
8125,It was to cheap looking,8125,1

8129,Way too small,8129,1
8130,I agree with Gwyllion.,8130,1
8130,Definitely not what was pictured.,8130,1
8130,I wanted the navy/gray/white.,8130,1
8130,It does state it's woven.,8130,1
8130,"It even appears as though it's a course woven material, which is what I wanted.",8130,1
8130,What you get is a knit-type material and the design is not at all what is pictured.,8130,1
8130,The color I received was black/white.,8130,1
8130,"They also would not take it back, and would only give me 10% off to keep it as it's imported from China.",8130,1
8130,"After several emails back and forth, I only got the price of the item back and not the tax/shipping I paid for it.",8130,1
8130,"Too bad they false advertise, as I just love the item that was displayed.",8130,1
8130,Nice gig they got going on!,8130,1
8130,[,8130,1
8131,Very pretty very small,8131,1
8132,"Dissapointed that this product has been ship from China I purchased these leggings for my daughter in law

They arrive a month from now.",8132,1
8132,I will review it again.,8132,1
8132,At this time low star.,8132,1
8133,Way too small,8133,1
8134,Broken when received.,8134,1
8134,Very poorly made.,8134,1
8135,Did not like the fit...looks awkward,8135,1
8136,Its a really cheap hat fits funny the patch is sewn at the top and the hat is unstructured so it looks weird bad product from stihl I just tossed it in the trash it was that bad,8136,1
8137,s***ty product honestly.,8137,1
8137,The picture is deceiving because it's more like a neck choker.,8137,1
8137,Disappointed,8137,1
8138,Logo on shirt came in yellow.,8138,1
8138,Ordered a large.. Perhaps they meant boys large.,8138,1
8138,Had to give it to my wife.,8138,1
8139,Way too small.,8139,1
8139,No liner.,8139,1
8139,I was disappointed in this purchase.,8139,1
8140,If I could rate this with less than a star I would..,8140,1
8140,"This band hardly fit, so when we adjusted the size with the ""tool"" provided, the entire band started to fall apart.",8140,1
8140,"Pins were broken and popping out, other pins refused to come out without pliers.",8140,1
8140,Then the tool to adjust the size broke before we truly got to use it.,8140,1
8140,Now I'm stuck with a broken band that is unuseable.,8140,1
8140,I wish I could return this piece of junk but the shipping back to China is more then I paid for this band.,8140,1
8140,Oh and it was a Mother's Day gift.,8140,1
8140,Horrible and disappointing.,8140,1
8140,Just want my money back.,8140,1
8140,If I had my money back id easily retract this review....,8140,1
8141,It was too small.,8141,1
8141,The gauge was too small and the length was also very short.,8141,1
8142,the material does not breathe and you have to be tiny to for this to fit comfortable,8142,1
8143,I ordered the 5X and it's really the size of a medium.,8143,1
8143,So cheaply made and thin fabric.,8143,1
8144,The quality is terrible.,8144,1
8144,It feels like a cheap Halloween costume.,8144,1
8145,The watch would never keep the correct time....,8145,1
8145,Ever,8145,1
8146,Stunk like crazy and was too small.,8146,1
8146,Do not buy it.,8146,1
8147,Does not look like the model,8147,1
8148,"Wore it once it pop,,,,,,",8148,1
8149,"When mine arrived, the glass was cloudy and cracked.",8149,1
8149,"Inside didn't look like dandelion seeds, but a spider's egg sac.",8149,1
8149,I plan on throwing away the glass bulb and keeping the chain.,8149,1
8149,It wasn't worth it.,8149,1
8150,This top fit perfect before washing.,8150,1
8150,It shrank to a medium after washing.,8150,1
8151,I've used these with 3 kids (1 girl and twin boys).,8151,1
8151,Originally I loved these and thought they were great when I used them for my daughter.,8151,1
8151,I just had twins and started to use these again.,8151,1
8151,One of my sons was crying after I put these mittens on and when I took the mittens off to give him a bath I notice that it had burned his skin off.,8151,1
8151,The velcro rubs on the skin to the point that it left a HUGE rug/rope type burn.,8151,1
8151,He had an open wound and then a bright red rug burn around his wrist.,8151,1
8151,It has taken months to heal and the red scar is still there.,8151,1
8151,I think something has changed with the product because this never happened with my daughter and I used this for months when she was born.,8151,1
8151,Maybe they have changed the type of material or the type of velcro.,8151,1
8151,"I don't recommend this for anyone's baby the pain, the injury, and the scar make this product dangerous to babies.",8151,1
8152,I purchased this bag for my honeymoon o Mexico.,8152,1
8152,The one strap broke within 3 hours of using it.,8152,1
8152,I didn't fill the bag a lot of anything.,8152,1
8152,"It's cheap material and eventually the other strap broke, all while trying to get through the airport.",8152,1
8153,"For white shirt, very cheap material.",8153,1
8153,You can see through it very well.,8153,1
8153,It looks a see through lingerie.,8153,1
8153,It's ridiculous.,8153,1
8153,Very disappointed.,8153,1
8154,These aren't sharp at all.,8154,1
8154,Totally dissatisfied with this product.,8154,1
8155,"WAY TO SMALL, CHEAP FABRIC",8155,1
8156,Cheap cheap material.,8156,1
8156,I wish I could give this a zero stars,8156,1
8157,What is shown is not what I received.,8157,1
8157,I was so excited and it is literally a big white gauze sheet with no decoration.,8157,1
8157,Don't waste your money y'all.,8157,1
8158,The dress that I received was not an XL I'm so disappointed.,8158,1
8158,Usually an XL is huge on me.,8158,1
8158,This dress went on but it was too tight to close.,8158,1
8159,The dress is nothing like the one in the photo.,8159,1
8159,"The lace is not dainty or light it is very bulky, cream not white, and it isn't even connected to the dress.",8159,1
8159,The bottom is a scratchy tool and puffs out nothing like the smoothly picture it shows.,8159,1
8159,I wish I could give it 0 stars and I requested a return.,8159,1
8160,This product is awful.,8160,1
8160,"It's practically paper so it does not go on or sit smoothly, it wrinkles.",8160,1
8160,So if you're wearing a solid color shirt you can see every detail of the pastie through the shirt which defeats the ENTIRE purpose.,8160,1
8161,"Beautiful color, absolutely no label or cleaning instructions anywhere.",8161,1
8161,"Washed it once, air dry, and now it fits (kind of) the 7 year old neighbor girl.",8161,1
8162,This is see through t-shirt material and SO unflattering.,8162,1
8162,I really don't know where to start reviewing it.,8162,1
8162,Don't bother.,8162,1
8163,Looks more like a child's shirt than a grown woman's blouse.,8163,1
8163,It's horrible.,8163,1
8163,Didn't want to give it any stars but it won't let me.,8163,1
8163,Don't waste your money.,8163,1
8164,Again bait and switch!!!,8164,1

8165,These Pantyhose have a CROSS embroidered in them.,8165,1
8166,Ordered xxl and calf circumferance is tiny,8166,1
8167,"Ok the fit is weird, it's a faux wrap, the material is very cheap and see through.",8167,1
8167,The only thing I like is the pattern...back it goes...Smh,8167,1
8168,very unhappy,8168,1
8169,The swim suit don't look like the picture at all.,8169,1
8169,It's entirely cut too small!,8169,1

8173,It was not a Simply Southern shirt!,8173,1
8173,It was a fake and a bad game at that!,8173,1

8175,Was too small with no elasticity,8175,1
8176,The cables is exposed !,8176,1

8177,Cheaply made.,8177,1
8178,"Too small,

8182,Returned product..aweful sizing.,8182,1
8182,Wish i could give zero stars,8182,1
8183,I ordered (4) pair of what I hoped were the same pajamas for my grandchildren.,8183,1
8183,They were all slightly different colors and the only one that fit properly was the one for the baby - 4 months old.,8183,1
8184,Do not waste your money or time with this item... it looks nothing like picture and the material is even worse.. save yourself the headache..,8184,1
8185,I think the cap made my dark spots darker.,8185,1
8185,I do not think the UV ray was sufficient.,8185,1
8186,Too small.cheap looking,8186,1
8187,instead of being extra thick they are extra thin.,8187,1
8187,Cannot use them.,8187,1
8188,Terrible in every way.,8188,1
8188,I'd give this corset zero stars if I could.,8188,1
8188,I am no stranger to corsets: I own about 20 corsets and I know very well that different styles fit differently.,8188,1
8188,"So I made sure I followed the instructions carefully: I'm 34-27-38, which puts me solidly in size M according to the size chart.",8188,1
8188,"I had to remove a full 4"" from the back of the corset and sew in new eyelets - and it's STILL too big.",8188,1
8188,THIS CORSET RUNS WAY BIGGER THAN THEIR SIZE CHART.,8188,1
8188,"Plus, stretchy corsets are, literally, completely non-functional.",8188,1
8188,You CANNOT cinch if the material stretches when you pull it.,8188,1
8188,"You don't reduce in size, the corset just stretches and bulges around you and makes you look WORSE.",8188,1
8188,"I wasn't trying to waist train or anything (TOTALLY not the right garment for that), I just wanted to get a nice snug corseted fit.",8188,1
8188,This garment was beyond useless for that.,8188,1
8188,"I'm fairly thin, with nice curves (narrow waist, wide hips), and this corset made me look like a straight up-and-down sausage.",8188,1
8188,Horribly unflattering.,8188,1
8188,I'd ask for my money back if I hadn't already altered the thing.,8188,1
8188,"I'll be able to make it work for this costume, but only because I'm wearing a DIFFERENT corset underneath me so I get an actual cinch.",8188,1
8188,I shouldn't need ANOTHER corset in order to be able to wear THIS corset.,8188,1
8189,Nothing like the picture.,8189,1
8189,See through.,8189,1

8191,They actually STINK.,8191,1
8191,"I am in process of washing them for the second time with all kinds of laundry additives, but I am skeptical.",8191,1
8191,"Since I have tried washing away the offensive odor, I don't think I can return them.",8191,1

8198,I ordered two handbags they stink try to get a hold of the menu factor she told me to put it outside she would only give me 20% off and I could give it to someone I would be afraid to give it to someone because of the smell because it is not leather,8198,1
8199,"After my husband misplaced his wedding band, we needed a replacement band quickly and at a good price.",8199,1

8272,TERRIBLE PRODUCT.,8272,1
8272,I ordered this headband expecting one similar to the show but this headband is awful.,8272,1
8272,The metal plate is too large and actually stretches from one temple to the other (in the show only a portion of the forehead is covered.),8272,1
8272,The plate was also placed very unevenly and is completely sticking off of one side of the headband so the cheap metal is rubbing your forehead which is not so comfortable.,8272,1
8272,This product was a complete waste of money and I would return in but I already returned a previously ordered headband from these guys which was also terribly made.,8272,1
8272,DONT BUY THIS.,8272,1
8273,Zero stars if there was that option.,8273,1
8273,"I don't know how they found people to write the good reviews, but this dress is honestly like a giant sack with no form at all.",8273,1

8287,"arrived used looking, dirty and cheap",8287,1
8288,These boots are adorable but the quality is terrible.,8288,1
8288,The attached photo was taken after my daughter wore the boots to school only ONE day.,8288,1
8288,She had other boots before that held up so much better (different brand that I can no longer find).,8288,1
8288,Don't buy these if you want them to look nice after more than one day of wear.,8288,1
8289,The bottom (shorts) part was larger & puffy than the picture showed.,8289,1
8289,"And, I did not really figured out how to do the back part... Anyways, I did not like the design so returned it.",8289,1
8290,It was hideous,8290,1
8291,Few buttons to close in the legs.,8291,1
8291,Because of it it's so open that you can see the legs and the diaper of the baby.,8291,1
8291,Also the fabric doesn't have a good quality.,8291,1
8292,Poor quality.,8292,1
8292,"Little support, only lasted a few weeks.",8292,1
8293,I got the exact same brand and size in yellow in a previous order and it fit perfectly.,8293,1
8293,"This was supposed to be a 2 XL, but it fit like a L.  I was so disgusted I didn't even send it back but just donated it to a thrift store.",8293,1
8293,I was so disappointed as my yellow one fits beautifully and is so very soft.,8293,1
8294,Measurements were way off.,8294,1
8294,The bust feels like you're wearing a bulletproof proof vest.,8294,1
8295,I got this wallet for my recent trip out of the country and it broke before I even left.,8295,1
8296,"This costume had a hole in one of the sleeves, thread hanging from numerous places, and oh yeah, they didn't even send the mask with it.",8296,1
8296,"Do
not buy.",8296,1
8297,The rings break in half.,8297,1
8298,Way way way wayyyyyyyyyy too small.,8298,1
8298,"These are CHINESE sizes, so the 3X that I ordered was actually an XL.",8298,1
8298,If you are a big woman DO NOT order from these people.,8298,1
8298,You will be sad,8298,1
8299,It tarnished very quickly,8299,1

8300,The bottoms are big and the top is tiny.,8300,1
8300,Lik children tiny.,8300,1

8303,"However, I just got it out of the box and it has damage to it already, which is disappointing.",8303,1
8303,Update: I have used for a week and it already has a hole in the pocket.,8303,1
8303,Save your money - DONT BUY!,8303,1
8303,!,8303,1
8304,You can see straight through whatever this flimsy cloth is they sent.,8304,1

8307,"Simply put, this robe is poor quality.",8307,1
8307,Loose threads all over this thing (and I'm not talking about the few stragglers from manufacturing).,8307,1
8307,The seams are lopsided and the overall construction is of poor quality.,8307,1
8307,"Low quality materials, poor quality construction.",8307,1
8307,Bad combo.,8307,1
8307,Given the price of this robe one would think it would be awesome.,8307,1
8307,Think again.,8307,1
8307,"If I paid $20 I would still be unhappy, but I would probably keep it.",8307,1
8307,"At $70, it's going back.",8307,1
8307,WORST OF ALL they sent me an already opened package that was clearly a return from someone else.,8307,1
8307,If you buy this item there is a good chance you're going to get the one I just sent back.,8307,1
8307,"Not only will I never buy this brand again, I will never buy from eluxurysupply.com.",8307,1
8308,The size chart is very confusing the item was much smaller than the size selected!,8308,1
8309,"It's too small, it's more in child sizes.",8309,1
8310,I would not buy these again.,8310,1
8310,I would return them if I wasn't leaving the country in a few days.,8310,1
8310,"The material is extremely thin, the top very short, the waist band on the pants are very small making them uneccessarily tight, and to top it off, the black pair has a hole in the butt area.",8310,1
8310,Comforting to know thag I will be in freezing Temps wearing flimsy material.,8310,1
8311,Not worthy of a star.,8311,1
8311,Horrible experience.,8311,1
8311,Couldn't get a full refund.,8311,1
8311,Total joke.,8311,1

8313,Nowhere does the description read that the product is from Asia!,8313,1
8313,Was ordered as a Christmas gift!,8313,1
8314,Too small,8314,1
8315,"These look cute, but are very cheap.",8315,1
8315,The lenses are not really protection from sun.,8315,1
8316,I had to give these shorts to my 12 year old daughter.,8316,1
8316,These are not made for women they are made for little girls.,8316,1
8316,They are not made to size at all.,8316,1
8316,the size chart is not relevant to US figures.,8316,1
8316,I love how they are made as far as the design is concerned but I will not order from this company again as the sizing is not correct,8316,1
8317,So flimsy.,8317,1
8317,"I have the worst fallen arches, These did nothing for support.",8317,1
8318,Sure was beautiful the first day I wore it.,8318,1
8318,"Then next day, I looked down to admire my ring.....the entire CZ stone & setting was completely missing.",8318,1
8318,I'm pissed!!!,8318,1
8318,"I want another one, but after reading other reviews on this particular ring, I absolutely refuse to!",8318,1
8319,It wasn't even close to the sizing guide.,8319,1
8319,Useless!,8319,1
8320,The dress was a completely different color than what was advertised.,8320,1
8321,"Horrible I ordered this dress to go International to a surprise party, instead I was suprise  n disgusted in what I go; a dress that can't fit me or even my size small daughter, and they have the nerve to offer me $5 to keep the dress.",8321,1
8321,Lol the are a joke one them chinks get your money the they ain't trying to let it go.,8321,1

8325,cleats ripped  after two wears.,8325,1

8328,It's this super tiny navy shirt with a giant square SS badly screen printed on the front and nothing on the back.,8328,1
8328,It's awful.,8328,1
8328,I could have done a better fake at home with my printer.,8328,1
8328,I already had Amazon refund my money.,8328,1
8328,STAY AWAY!,8328,1
8329,This literally looks like a napkin.,8329,1
8329,Don't buy it.,8329,1
8330,"Received my order today, not the right one.",8330,1
8330,Please contact me regarding this problem.,8330,1
8331,First of all the watch did not work when it came.,8331,1
8331,I took to jewelry store and they could not get back off so I am out almost 30.00 and have nothing.,8331,1

8340,"Had to return, color is more red than I thought, not burgundy.",8340,1
8341,"The zipper is weaker than the tag, you'll break it.",8341,1
8341,Also the 12 month size is as big as my roomate's 3 year old daughter.,8341,1
8342,"I'm really disappointed I ordered the Angelus water and stain reppellent, and I received a really small spray bottle, that it's in Spanish and it's not even the brand, it doesnt even got a brand, I want my money back",8342,1
8343,Nice color.,8343,1
8343,Very cheap material.,8343,1
8344,Came broken,8344,1
8345,I've seen this out fit on pinterest and super excited to find it online!,8345,1
8345,I ordered a medium because I do have a bit of a chest and a little bit of a bottom and I didn't want it to be super tight on me.,8345,1
8345,Turns out the medium looks like such a joke on me.,8345,1
8345,"If my schedule hadn't gotten so busy, I definitely would have returned it.",8345,1
8345,I still might reach out to the seller and do so since I've only had it on long enough to determine that I really don't like it.,8345,1
8345,"I'd say order a size down, just to be on the same side.",8345,1
8345,"In my case, the sizing ran bigger than expected.",8345,1
8346,"The fringe got pulled it got stuck to my chair, and the whole thing fell apart.",8346,1
8346,:( I'm going to try to repair it.,8346,1
8346,It is not made to last long.,8346,1
8347,Lenses are already ruined.,8347,1
8347,They are supposed to be polarized but the lenses are separating.,8347,1
8347,Very disappointed as I can't return.,8347,1

8352,Cheap.,8352,1
8352,Broke after using it twice.,8352,1
8352,The pin wouldn't come out of the backing piece.,8352,1
8352,We had to use pliers to pull it apart.,8352,1
8353,I would not get this one.,8353,1
8353,You won't be able to wear in under a shirt.,8353,1
8353,The material that goes by your ribs are loose...,8353,1
8353,So you won't get the resolute you are wanting.,8353,1
8353,It fits oddly.,8353,1
8354,Not at all the print that was shown in the picture.,8354,1
8354,So disappointed to spend my money on this.,8354,1
8355,sizing is way off.......waste of money ...gave it away.....silver ornament is plastic,8355,1
8356,Way to large and is not portioned right.,8356,1
8357,"Wish I could return same for an XL size, but its too costly to do so from where I live in Trinidad.",8357,1
8358,This fits  badly!,8358,1
8358,The split is really high and the tummy bulges.,8358,1
8358,I am disappointed.,8358,1
8358,I am not sure how to make this dress work.,8358,1
8359,Do not buy!,8359,1
8359,It's so cheaply made the top doesn't fit right and it has nooooo elastic to hold up.,8359,1
8359,It looked like a cheap weird outfit def not as deceived,8359,1
8360,Way too small,8360,1
8361,Sending Back.,8361,1
8361,"These socks are Thin, very big in the foot area and super tight from the ankle on up.",8361,1
8361,If you have bird legs swollen feet and love thin socks I would jump on these.,8361,1
8362,Runs super small!!,8362,1
8362,I purchased this to wear under one of my shorter sweaters but I can't even wear it it's too uncomfortable.,8362,1
8362,I would order X2 sizes up!,8362,1
8363,I was severely disappointed in this bracelet.,8363,1
8363,I had looked at several other corsage bracelets & this looked the prettiest w/ the best reviews.,8363,1
8363,"But when I got it, I thought, ""What???""",8363,1
8363,"It's 3 separate bracelets not attached at all, except with 2 very slippery thin ribbons that don't stay knotted unless they are glued.",8363,1
8363,(Which in turn makes a noticeable bump under the corsage w/ all the knots & glue.),8363,1
8363,Another reason why I wanted this one is because none of the pictures showed the metal attachment that so many other bracelets had... just the clear plastic plate to glue the corsage on.,8363,1
8363,"Well, surprise!",8363,1
8363,It came with it.,8363,1
8363,"The metal piece can be taken off fairly easily, but then you have to re-tie the ribbons to the clear plate, which takes extra time.",8363,1
8363,Lastly - & also very disappointing - is that the bracelets are very tight.,8363,1
8363,"I've had comments on how thin my wrists are, so I'm not asking for extra-large here.",8363,1
8363,Just big enough where you don't think it's going to break when you put it on.,8363,1
8363,The bracelet is definitely not one-size-fits-all.,8363,1
8363,It's size small.,8363,1
8363,"So after all these problems, I cannot recommend this bracelet.",8363,1
8363,:(,8363,1
8364,I have a 19 inch calf and wear a size 11 shoe.,8364,1
8364,I tried on one sock from the six-pack and it only reached 2/3 of the way up my calf.,8364,1
8364,"Dreadful,  Sending them back.",8364,1
8365,It's so large and very rigid.,8365,1
8365,It's very hard to put a hair tie on it and it comes off when you finally do.,8365,1
8365,My wrists are small but this thing is super uncomfortable even as a bracelet.,8365,1
8366,It fades mine did,8366,1
8367,way to small and fit wrong,8367,1
8368,Looks nothing like the picture,8368,1
8369,I recieved the wrong sweater.,8369,1
8369,It had a different slogan on it.,8369,1
8370,Way too small,8370,1
8371,"This dress is very pretty, and looks exactly like the picture!",8371,1
8371,But it is definitely not true to size!!,8371,1
8371,"I wear a 16, so I got a 2x!",8371,1
8371,Way too small,8371,1
8372,Arrived with chains not attached and one of the stones had fallen off.,8372,1
8372,Very inexpensive but extremely cheaply made as well.,8372,1
8373,So disappointed.,8373,1
8373,What a waste of money.,8373,1
8374,Very cheaply made and definitely not worth the price.,8374,1
8374,I would not recommend this to anyone.,8374,1
8375,Horrible,8375,1
8376,"When it finally arrived, it was already tarnished.",8376,1
8376,"Even after coating it with clear nail polish, it was too late and started leaving stains whenever i wore it",8376,1
8377,"I received the Taxi Wallet (Sea Turtle), on November 8th and on November 16th the snap on the front of the wallet broke off.",8377,1
8377,"I didn't overstuff the wallet, I only had my drivers license, debit card, receipts and a few bucks in it.",8377,1
8377,"I do think this is a pricey wallet and expect the craftsmanship and quality to reflect that, and it did not.",8377,1
8377,I paid the full amount of $34.50 for this product and did not receive a discount for my review.,8377,1
8377,I have returned the wallet and received a refund.,8377,1
8378,This is not for babies.,8378,1
8378,It is for big kids.,8378,1
8378,"Too big for a baby's head, unless your baby has an extraordinarily large head.",8378,1
8378,It fits my 8 yr old son but it was intended for my 4 month old daughter.,8378,1
8379,Broke after four month,8379,1
8380,It was broke,8380,1
8381,This blouse is horribly see through.,8381,1
8381,Nothing like what's seen in picture.,8381,1
8381,I was reluctant to even write a review on this product but since amazon keeps bugging me about reviewing my purchases......,8381,1
8381,There you have it.,8381,1
8381,Waste of money.,8381,1
8381,Please take it from me!!!!!,8381,1
8381,I won't waste my time to lie to y'all.,8381,1
8381,PS If I had an option of no stars that's what this product would've received.,8381,1
8381,But you had to rate it in order to submit comment,8381,1
8382,1 week used and the necklace darked.,8382,1
8383,No size descriptions make these tough.,8383,1
8383,WOuldn't buy them or from this seller again.,8383,1
8384,It is so see through.,8384,1
8384,It does not look like the picture at all.,8384,1
8384,I would not buy!,8384,1
8384,It's a waste of money!,8384,1
8385,"The material is very then, therefore it shows everything.",8385,1
8385,The actual material does not match the material shown in the picture.,8385,1
8385,"I like the look of the outfit, however the material made the outfit too tight to wear out in public.",8385,1
8386,Broke within the day.,8386,1
8387,"I am a size 5 and granted yeah my bust is larger than average but i couldn't get this over my hips, let alone the rest of my body.",8387,1
8387,"It is very cute, but doesn't do me any good since it almost ripped with me just trying to put it on.",8387,1
8387,"Also, I am 5'2"".",8387,1
8387,"I do not know who this was made to fit, but I would say someone my height would be the very top of the height bracket for this.",8387,1
8388,not good quality,8388,1
8389,Ever order something from China?,8389,1
8389,This is no different.,8389,1
8389,Don't order something from China unless you live in China.,8389,1
8390,I ordered a small because I'm a size 0 and the top was way too small.,8390,1
8390,The bottoms fit.,8390,1
8390,"It isn't the same bathing suit that's in the picture, it's not olive green either and the bottoms came in the cheeky style instead of full like the picture so it'll look like a thong bathing suit which I do not like.",8390,1
8390,I'm going to give it away or add material to it because I don't like it.,8390,1
8391,"Extremely cheap,scratchy fabric that is not any where near the size ordered.",8391,1
8391,I would not recommend this product.,8391,1
8391,About 3 sizes smaller than ordered.,8391,1
8392,"I would have loved this bag if the chain didn't break right out of the package, shorty thereafter the inside pocket lining ripped and one of the fringe pieces fell off.",8392,1
8392,This was a truly disappointing experience.,8392,1
8392,"I have bought inexpensive bags and they have lasted years, so it is not what I expected.",8392,1
8393,Horrible.,8393,1
8393,Not even close to what was advertised.,8393,1
8393,My 5 year old has better sewing skills and the material is something that Wal-Mart rejected!,8393,1
8393,!,8393,1
8394,"Purchased in largest size available as a gift.... but it was so small, it looked more like a regular Medium!",8394,1
8394,VERY disappointed!,8394,1
8394,Am returning it and will not buy from this distributor again.,8394,1
8395,"Horrible quality, I could have made something more durable and higher quality , don't waist your time and money",8395,1
8396,"I could probably save time by just copying 'Radiantwild's review exactly, which I wish I had seen before purchasing.",8396,1
8396,"First off, size.",8396,1
8396,"""Too small"" is an understatement.",8396,1
8396,"The title clearly says ""Women's"" sizing.",8396,1
8396,"My 5'0"" 95-pound, thin, athletic daughter wears their size XL so let that be a guide.",8396,1
8396,Second is the quality.,8396,1
8396,"I actually ordered 3 sweaters at the same time (same style, same color) and every single one of them is a different quality, different material, and different fabric?!?",8396,1
8396,Even the cuffs are different.,8396,1
8396,2 were just the thin (VERY THIN) material folded over and 1 has a ribbed material for the cuff.,8396,1
8396,The fabric is so thin if you're wearing a T-shirt with words on it underneath you'd have no problem reading it.,8396,1
8396,1 sweater had about 10 unfinished seams and threads hanging everywhere.,8396,1
8396,The other two just had very poorly sewn seams.,8396,1
8396,"To be honest, when I opened the package it looked like a elementary school home ec project gone terribly wrong.",8396,1
8396,The item is shipped from China so you can't return it.,8396,1
8396,"I was offered $3.50 for a refund, and to keep the item.",8396,1
8396,So I'm out about $45 (for three) and have a wad of fabric I can't imagine using for any other purpose.,8396,1
8396,You get what you pay for.,8396,1
8396,Lesson learned.,8396,1
8397,"Clasp doesn't work, and rest of the necklace fell apart before it was worn.",8397,1
8398,comes super fast.,8398,1
8398,looks nothing like the picture.,8398,1
8398,I ordered the lavender one and it looks nothing like the picture wasn't even the right color.,8398,1
8398,I was very disappointed and returned it right away 10/10 do not recommend.,8398,1
8399,Poor quality material and runs extremely small.,8399,1
8399,Would not recommend product to anyone,8399,1
8400,It's like grandma knitted this sweater together.,8400,1
8400,It's really just yarn that's knitted together to make a cheap looking sweater.,8400,1
8400,I definitely will not be wearing mines!,8400,1
8400,I think after one wash it probably will fall apart,8400,1
8401,The chances of a nip slip with this top is very very high.,8401,1
8402,Was so excited these in the mail--The colors are beautiful.,8402,1
8402,HOWEVER--Although I have my ears pierced these are way too thick!!,8402,1
8402,So disappointed I couldn't even get them through my ears :( What a waste.,8402,1
8403,The size is for kids.,8403,1
8404,I don't like,8404,1

8409,They were ok as far as quality but way too small.,8409,1
8409,"I wen up a size but with my 33"" waist maybe I should have ordered an extra large.",8409,1
8409,I see a lot of complaints about swimsuits made in China as to their fit.,8409,1
8409,"If Chinese companies want to sell swimwear in the USA, maybe they should make the suits they are exporting to fit correctly.",8409,1
8409,Thank you Amazon for making the return so effortless.,8409,1
8409,That was very much appreciated.,8409,1
8410,I really didn't like that it was all air sealant.,8410,1
8410,It seemed like it was left in the heat for a while cause it was all stuck together causing it to have discolor ex in certain parts of it.,8410,1
8410,I really didn't like that the head band is all funky where one side sticks out and the other is sowed on.,8410,1
8410,The star on the head band has paper stuck to it & I can't get the paper off.,8410,1

8412,"It fits poorly, the slits in the front are much too long and end up almost showing your nipple (one wrong move), and the color is not the dark red shown.",8412,1
8412,Returned,8412,1
8413,Not true to size for USA,8413,1
8414,"Way to small in the breast area, even measured myself to order the right size, idk why they put a B sized breast cup inside a XL bathing suit.",8414,1
8415,The stone fell out one month after I started wearing it,8415,1

8421,The skirt isn't even really a skirt.,8421,1
8421,It is super short and is made of the cheapest fabric ever.,8421,1
8421,"I plan to wear the top with a black running  skirt I already have, but this is VERY low quality",8421,1

8426,"I had high hopes for this, but my son tried this on one time for a few seconds and the clip fell off when he took it off.",8426,1
8426,Bummer.,8426,1

8428,"Didn't fit what so ever , sizes are off .",8428,1
8429,"They don't fit, and it's too expensive to send them back.",8429,1

8433,Way too small unrealistic sizing,8433,1
8434,Do NOT buy these for your tongue.,8434,1
8434,After cleaning and putting one in my tongue it got infected.,8434,1
8434,I brushed it off to that it was already getting infected.,8434,1
8434,It has been two weeks and off and on infections.,8434,1
8434,"Wake up this morning and my tongue is full blown infected, and swollen.",8434,1
8434,Took piercing out put normal metal one back in and already feels better.,8434,1
8434,Idk what these are made of but they will destroy you.,8434,1
8434,(Mind you my tongue hasn't been infected in close to 7 years),8434,1
8435,Poor quality.,8435,1

8436,Chain does not look delicate and is to big,8436,1

8439,Cheap like the price.,8439,1
8439,Not a lot of give.,8439,1
8439,Huge in the mid section and too short in the legs.,8439,1
8439,If it were a better material it might have fit better.,8439,1
8440,Very very small cut - I ordered a large and it could barely fit over my head.,8440,1
8440,The large is more so a fit for a small person.,8440,1
8440,Be mindful that the chinese supplier does not accept returns.,8440,1
8441,I love these items.,8441,1
8441,I use them for my credit cards.,8441,1

8445,This was product was not what I expected and not what I wanted and was returned immanently.,8445,1
8446,I was hoping they'd fit right even after reading bad reviews but sadly they don't.,8446,1
8446,Too high waisted almost under sports bra and not flattering to the booty at all.,8446,1
8446,Would return them but don't want to go through the hassel for $10.,8446,1
8447,"Ripped the first time I wore them, almost completely see through",8447,1

8449,The stitching was so poorly done that it looked as if the dress was going to break.,8449,1
8449,I ignored the reviews but if I was you I would not recommend this dress to anyone.,8449,1
8449,Waste of money.,8449,1
8450,"You should definitely get a size up from what you are, because the sleeves are pretty short.",8450,1

8451,"I am 5'7"" and 130 lbs.",8451,1
8451,First I ordered a med.,8451,1

8451,This is very aggravating!,8451,1

8453,It was not a complete dress.,8453,1
8453,It had loose pieces that made no sense.,8453,1
8453,The top was left open.,8453,1

8454,"Very disappointed, can't even wear them for PJ's.",8454,1
8454,"I guess I'll keep them and give them to someone since they were so cheaply priced, would probably cost more than their worth to send back.",8454,1

8464,I won't buy shirts from Amazon again.,8464,1
8465,If i can give it 0 stars i would!,8465,1
8465,"I literally threw it away, I couldn't even give it to anybody since it's so cheaply made.",8465,1
8466,The bigger problem is that it doesn't fit the Han Solo Blaster.,8466,1

8472,This dress looked more like a costume.,8472,1
8472,It had loose thread at the hem as well as on the back flap.,8472,1
8472,It looks as cheap as the price I paid for it.,8472,1
8472,I am returning this!,8472,1

8474,Cheap material and the straps were very long... dress was short and I'm only five four,8474,1
8475,Returned.,8475,1
8476,one piece  thick stretch material,8476,1
8477,Material is very cheap and super thin.,8477,1

8483,Even the size chart provided shows size M for my body type.,8483,1
8483,But to be on safe side I bought size L.However when the item arrived it was too small that I wasn't able to fit in it.,8483,1
8483,It was so tight at tummy and seat area that made me uncomfortable.,8483,1
8483,It was so small that my size S friend was happy to wear it.,8483,1

8489,"This would be nice on a slim person with tiny arms and chest (btw, my chest is small).",8489,1
8490,poor quality.,8490,1
8490,"stems folded against earring and the slightest movement, they break.",8490,1

8490,just another example of poor quality.,8490,1
8491,Very cheaply made,8491,1

8495,Loved the color but it was too small and a button popped off as soon as I tried to try it on.,8495,1
8496,It is not qualuty,8496,1

One of the sections was missing from the the ""gold"" color band.",8497,1
8497,"As I'm wondering ""what the heck"" (not exact words) i see on the inside of band a chunk of tungsten material missing ?",8497,1
8497,?????????,8497,1

8497,Can't wait for my review reply..........js,8497,1
8498,I don't know how they make this look good in the photos.,8498,1
8498,It's basically a sideways mickey mouse watch that feels as bad as it looks.,8498,1
8499,"The product is of very poor quality, expandable plastic saber is ultra thin and get broken.",8499,1
8499,The light does not turn on,8499,1
8500,The shirt is a cream color and it also fits really tight at the bottom and the arms are really tight as well.,8500,1
8500,The cat is really cute tho!,8500,1
8500,If you order it order a few sizes larger.,8500,1
8501,"The product stated it was women size, but the cut was small as if for a teen.",8501,1
8501,"I did not like the Ideal of paying postage both to receive and also
return.",8501,1
8501,If the cut had been as stated I could have easy worn one size larger or smaller in women.,8501,1

8501,just not happy.,8501,1
8502,The sweatshirt was way too small.,8502,1
8502,The material was very cheap.,8502,1
8502,Extremely unsatisfied.,8502,1
8502,I will not purchase from this seller again.,8502,1
8503,"This is not ""embroidered"" as its description says, it is an iron on, that came off almost immediately.",8503,1
8503,In the picture you can see the big black chunk where the iron on came off.,8503,1
8503,"I bought this in black and in blue a week ago for a summer wedding, and it's garbage.",8503,1
8503,Certainly not worth $40.,8503,1

8504,"It look very cheap, material was not presentable, I was not satisfied at all, I am very disappointed.",8504,1
8505,It's practically impossible to get the bead in.,8505,1
8506,I have a few of the Out of Print T-shirts and they all fit as expected and are great quality.,8506,1
8506,This is the second time I've ordered this particular shirt.,8506,1
8506,"Both times it was small for an ex-large, and both times it came in a men/boys crew neck instead of the women's round or scoop neck promised.",8506,1
8506,The second time I ordered it came more than a week late and the image was all smeared.,8506,1
8506,I didn't even take it out of the package.,8506,1
8506,Amazon really should police its sellers better.,8506,1
8507,"Not as it appears, nor does the size chart match the lace halter.",8507,1
8507,It seemed more like sexy lingerie.,8507,1
8508,I think the dress is cute....BUT......,8508,1
8508,The stitching is horrible AND there is a long snag across the front.,8508,1
8508,I was so ready to order other colors but I think not.,8508,1
8508,Sigh.,8508,1
8509,"Whats with these Chinese watches , this stops after 5-10 minute of winding disgusting.",8509,1

8511,The size came way too big.,8511,1
8511,Washed in hot water and threw in the dryer...unfortunately it didn't shrink to the appropriate size.,8511,1
8511,Of course the company wouldn't take it back.,8511,1
8511,The material is thin and feels cheap.,8511,1
8512,Dress is completely see through.,8512,1
8512,Do not buy.,8512,1
8513,Looked really ugly in person,8513,1
8514,This is Child or very small adult size.,8514,1
8514,I will never use it.,8514,1
8515,Maybe I just received a dud - but this was very poor quality - zipper broke at second use & I had to throw it out.,8515,1
8515,I also bought another bag from this company (carry on lightweight luggage fold tote duffel) and that lasted a full 2 weeks before the strap broke - so I think it's the materials & manufacturing.,8515,1
8515,Low cost but low quality - I wouldn't purchase from the company again - too many quality alternatives.,8515,1
8516,ripped within a few weeks of wearing them.,8516,1

8518,The bottoms were too tight for me to squeeze into (they might fit a 10 year old) and the top was so big and floppy it was sized more like and XL.,8518,1
8518,I promptly returned this swimsuit.,8518,1
8519,"This was not as advertised, very disappointed",8519,1
8520,Save your money - these are jacked up sizes from ?,8520,1
8520,?,8520,1
8520,some other country - the zipper is on the wrong side if you are used to american clothes.,8520,1
8520,And when it didn't fit the company said it would be $40 to ship it back to China...  so the gave me $10 off - complete rip off and waste of money for something that I could never wear,8520,1
8521,Way to small,8521,1
8522,Cheaply made broke in two days,8522,1

8640,My wife bought this based upon the pictures.,8640,1
8640,"After she received it, she was very disappointed because when she opened the package it smelled terrible, there were no tags indicating how to care for it, no indication of what it was made out of, there are threads hanging from the sleeves, and it was poorly constructed.",8640,1

8643,Cheap material and manufacturing.,8643,1
8643,Patches are top sewn and they are thin felt (reminded me of a fair stuffed animal ear) no where near where your elbows would land.,8643,1
8643,That made it very easy to pull off by the way (problem solved?).,8643,1
8643,"the button latch was a flap of material sewn in a loop and barely attached to the sweater, would probably not hold if worn all day.",8643,1
8644,Didn't care for it size chart wasn't accurate for outfit and very cheaply made poor quality,8644,1

8662,"They were thinner than I expected, and they could not be worn without my skin showing through.",8662,1
8662,I think that they are intended to be more like tights then like leggings to wear with a sweater.,8662,1
8662,Two of the pairs that I wore ran the first time.,8662,1
8662,So I returned all six pairs.,8662,1

8669,"When the bracelet arrived, beads from the petals were off of it.",8669,1
8669,No problem.,8669,1
8669,It was a matter of attaching them back on with glue.,8669,1
8669,"But I also ordered the matching earrings, which also had missing beads.",8669,1
8669,"Only one missing stone was in the bag, the other two were missing all together.",8669,1
8669,"** Also, I wore the bracelet once, and the elastic in the bracelet broke.",8669,1

8848,"I washed them to see if they would shrink, no luck.",8848,1
8848,The material is very thin and the cut is high waisted.,8848,1
8848,I threw them in the garbage.,8848,1
8849,The checkered material is very rough!!,8849,1
8849,It felt like a table cloth!,8849,1
8849,!,8849,1
8850,"The top portion was too small and see through, like a cheap ribbed tank top.",8850,1
8850,"The waist seam did not even hit below my chest, making the skirt fall in a weird way.",8850,1
8850,Returned.,8850,1
8851,"Short torso, and I'm not even tall.",8851,1
8852,I don't  really like it,8852,1
8853,"Didn't like the product due to the zipper being poorly made, and will always get stuck.",8853,1

8855,The zipper fell completely off as soon as I tried to zip it up.,8855,1
8855,I'm very disappointed thus far smh.,8855,1

8857,Save your money.,8857,1
8858,"Definitely didn't work with my trumpet type dress, it's a cheap petticoat so I guess you get what you pay for.",8858,1

8858,Yay for nice people.,8858,1
8859,This is the cheapest blouse I have ever seen made.,8859,1
8859,I can't wear this in public.,8859,1
8859,"The hem is crooked, the whole top is see thru, and the ""off-shoulder"" is not off shoulder.",8859,1
8859,There is a split about 2 inches long on each side around the shoulder area which makes no sinse.,8859,1
8859,It just looks like the seam is not sewn together right or there is a hole on each side.,8859,1
8859,And its like a cape over a blouse.,8859,1
8860,These took a month to arrive from China to the US.,8860,1
8860,"After hand washing them, I worked out in them once (jogging for an hour, nothing crazy) and the crotch seam split open.",8860,1
8860,Not a great investment.,8860,1
8861,The top fit okay but the bottoms were way too small.,8861,1
8861,I have average proportions and typically have no problem with buying the same size for the top and bottom.,8861,1
8861,But this suit was way off and I threw out the bottoms.,8861,1
8862,Not my style,8862,1

8866,Way WAY too small unless you're a tiny teenager or very petite.,8866,1
8867,Wayyyy too small,8867,1
8868,Color not as shown.,8868,1
8868,It's a neon bright orange.,8868,1

8869,"The front tie looks nice pictures, but in real life it's awkward.",8869,1
8870,Much much too small... sizing is off.,8870,1
8870,I got this 3 sizes larger and it was still too small.,8870,1
8871,I ordered this for my son's second birthday.,8871,1
8871,The size was way too big for a two year old!,8871,1
8871,When I requested to return for a refund they expected me to pay for shipping.,8871,1
8871,Very disappointed.,8871,1
8872,I'm severely disappointed with this product...,8872,1
8872,It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.,8872,1
8872,"When I finally got the package, I opened it to discover that the appliqu on the sleeves wasn't even attached!",8872,1
8872,I had to try and hand sew the appliqu to the sleeves of the shirt by myself.,8872,1
8872,I paid ten bucks for a blue spandex shirt and a pile of cheap lace... Not worth it.,8872,1
8873,Cheaply made.,8873,1
8874,Very small sizing does not run true to size,8874,1
8875,Disappointed with this.,8875,1
8875,The size specs just seem off.,8875,1
8875,Too big on top and the neckline is too wide.,8875,1
8876,don't buy it people!,8876,1
8876,"I read the reviews, but ordered anyway because of the price.",8876,1
8876,"I looks nothing like the pic, is too small even tho' I bought 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear.",8876,1
8876,I took a chance but now it is going straight to the thrift store.,8876,1
8876,It is soft though.,8876,1
8877,very thin,8877,1
8878,way to small length and size,8878,1
8879,Super cheap looking and did not hang like it shows in the picture.,8879,1
8879,Size was also too large.,8879,1
8880,didn't fit at all.,8880,1
8880,it looks child size,8880,1
8881,Absolutely no stretch.,8881,1
8881,Disappointed.,8881,1
8882,"From the picture it looks great, and I thought what a good idea, per the measurement chart goes by hip size and bust, well you will need to measure down.",8882,1
8882,this item is very loosely fitting for a full figure woman.,8882,1
8882,"If you looking for these item to hold you in tight its not it, the material is not tight firm enough.",8882,1
8882,"now don't get me wrong it will slim the stomach down, but not firm.",8882,1
8882,Well overall this might be more inline for a smaller person who is not full figured.,8882,1
8882,"Please measure and go down a size, every woman is different.",8882,1
8882,and this is not for every woman.,8882,1
8882,I hope this helps.,8882,1
8883,It's way too small.,8883,1
8884,"do not buy this dress, cheap cheap fabric.",8884,1
8884,large is like size 0. i try over and over to cancel this dress.,8884,1
8884,"but the seller did not , after seeing it was shipped 4 days after .",8884,1
8884,poor,8884,1
8885,Unfortunately the zipper broke without any effort of me putting the costume on..,8885,1
8885,"I would be happier if you sent me a costume that doesn't have a cheap, broken zipper..",8885,1
8885,Very disappointed!,8885,1
8886,poor quality.,8886,1
8886,"The buttons are too small for the button holes, they pop open at any time, even if the shirt fits fine, and the thread is in strange large bulks in places.",8886,1
8887,These were a fuzzy mess Would not recommend !,8887,1
8887,Tried washing on delicate and low heat as they were small for a size large.,8887,1
8887,My dryer and vent were full of fuzz!,8887,1
8888,Sized too small and deceptive wording on shipping obscured the fact that I can't return the item.,8888,1
8888,Great.,8888,1
8889,Way too small.,8889,1
8889,I donated it to Salvation Army.,8889,1
8890,This cover up is sized way too small.,8890,1
8890,It fit like a little kids dress but wasn't worth the money to return it.,8890,1
8890,I gave to my niece.,8890,1
8891,Total crap... it's piece of cut material that is unhemmed - would send back but not worth the time!,8891,1
8892,Way too short.,8892,1
8892,Looks like a shirt not a dress.,8892,1
8893,"Button holes are blocked, material is weak and XL is more a XS-waste of money",8893,1
8894,Cheap quality.,8894,1
8894,Flimsy.,8894,1
8894,Save your money.,8894,1

8906,"Too small, too thin, and see through.",8906,1
8907,Don't buy this shirt or any others you see are made in china.,8907,1
8907,The shirt is paper thin with terribly loose stitching and the seams are irregular in places so the fit it incredibly unflattering.,8907,1
8907,I am a medium and ordered the 3x because of the other reviews stating how small this is but I still wasn't prepared for this.,8907,1
8907,The 3X did not fit at all and is really tight through the hips and belly ...its a very ugly look.,8907,1
8907,Its not gonna look or fit anything like in the picture.,8907,1
8907,My worst purchase ever!,8907,1

8909,"Package arrived only with the sunglass case, the actual glasses were not in the case!",8909,1
8910,"The bar was far too short to comfortably fit anything, and the wings weren't even able to screw on and off.",8910,1
8910,There was crustie looking things inside one of the wings and it didn't even thread to the bar,8910,1
8911,They are very small that can barely be seen when you wear it.,8911,1
8911,Way too small than I expected.,8911,1
8912,Way to big.,8912,1
8912,I ordered mediums and received large ones.,8912,1
8912,Didn't notice until I already opened them and washed them.,8912,1
8912,"Very upset, can't wear them.",8912,1
8912,Waste of money.,8912,1
8913,WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SHORT SLEEVE BUT WAS LONG SLEEVE AND TOO LARGE!,8913,1

8917,So so small... Don't waste your time.,8917,1
8917,It looks like you awkwardly tried wrapping a scarf around your boobs and shoulders.,8917,1
8917,I'm embarrassed to go out in it.,8917,1
8917,34-28-37,8917,1

8925,Not wearable.,8925,1
8926,Would not recommend it.,8926,1
8926,The sizes are off.,8926,1
8926,It's a tacky material and it's see through.,8926,1
8926,Do not recommend,8926,1
8927,I'm not too thrilled with these warm-up pants because of the chord design the wearer must use to keep them up.,8927,1
8927,"It's a ""single cord"" design that makes it difficult to tie any type of not that will keep them up, and the elastic waist band is too flimsy to keep them up on its own - or for that matter, strong enough to do so even in connection with any knot you manage to come up with.",8927,1
8927,"To make matters worse, the string used to secure the pants is made of such a flimsy material that any knot strong enough to hold the pants up for more than 2 minutes before coming apart is impossible to untie.",8927,1
8927,"After spending several minutes to untie the knot, it gets so frayed that it may break after repeating the process 2 or 3 times.",8927,1
8927,"Because these pants cost more than others Champion sells, I was expecting a slightly better product than others they sell.",8927,1
8927,"While I have some other Champion sweat pants I purchased several years ago, I can't fathom why they didn't simply continue selling those and changed their design...doing so was a very poor decision on Champion's part.",8927,1
8927,"To sum things up, don't purchase these sweat pants!",8927,1
8928,Very displeased,8928,1
8929,The bottom was too small so I sent this back.,8929,1

8934,The material is very thin.,8934,1
8934,"With white panels on the front and back, I will not feel comfortable wearing them in public.",8934,1
8934,Also the size runs very small.,8934,1
8934,"I went up a size, but they still fit a little tighter than I would expect.",8934,1
8934,These will be used only for videos in front of the TV in the privacy of my own home.,8934,1
8934,Too bad because the print is fantastic for Harry Potter fans.,8934,1
8934,"I would like to note, too, that the wrong size was shipped initially, but customer service was friendly and they sent out a replacement quickly.",8934,1
8935,This is not a woman 's jacket this is an xl  child's jacket.,8935,1

8940,I will be sending back to the seller asap.,8940,1
8940,Do not waist your money on this item.,8940,1
8941,The material was cheap like the Halloween costume material and had no patting for the underwear.,8941,1
8941,Giving you a cameltoe,8941,1
8942,"The body, itself, fit although it seems much longer than what it appears.",8942,1
8942,The part I couldn't deal with was the opening for your head.,8942,1
8942,The hole is so wide that it slid off both shoulders.,8942,1
8942,Both bra straps were fully exposed.,8942,1
8942,Just because I need an XL doesn't mean I have a neck the size of an elephant.,8942,1
8943,Beautiful coat but very very small,8943,1
8944,"These are cute, but they have a loud smell.",8944,1

8948,The colors are so ugly I almost sent it back.,8948,1
8948,I would not recommend this to anyone as you are not getting what is actually showing in the picture.,8948,1
8949,Took about three weeks to get the package from China.,8949,1
8949,"After exactly one week of daily wear the sandals are delaminating, just as other reviewers warned.",8949,1
8949,See attached pictures.,8949,1
8949,I'm requesting a refund.,8949,1

8952,I would have liked it if it wasn't BROKEN when I received it.,8952,1

8959,It sucks .,8959,1
8960,Not at all as pictured.,8960,1
8960,I have never given anything a bad review and honestly it would be perfect for a small B or A cup but for me I'm 36C and this didn't work for me at all not enough coverage I won't be able to wear it at all,8960,1
8961,It is a strange design with two small coverage in the breast area,8961,1
8962,Sizing is NOT correct.,8962,1
8962,Don't order.,8962,1
8962,I ordered the size for an 8-10 yr old.,8962,1

8964,But they advertise in America they need to get their size chart caught up with American women.,8964,1
8965,It was like a small that maybe someone who wore a size 6 could wear it bought a large I'm a 12 and it was 3  sizes to small,8965,1

8967,Got it and tried it on.,8967,1
8967,The fit was a bit snugg but that what a expected.,8967,1
8967,Had it on for about an hr and the center seam split open from chest to crotch.,8967,1
8968,It was extremely small like it was made for a child....I had to rip everything and crack the seams just to fit it over my bust and I'm only a B cup to give you an idea of how small this runs.....my husband was like is that what it's suppose ot be like and I said no but more reason for you to tear it off....lol......so yea....great concept.....it's just a shame it doesn't fit normal sizes.,8968,1
8968,I'm not sure what they where fitting this to when designing it.,8968,1
8969,It's a 3X and looks like a ladies large.,8969,1

8978,I ordered two different sizes but they were the same .,8978,1
8978,And there was no size indication on the dresses.,8978,1
8978,So one was to small and for the other was a bit large.,8978,1
8978,So we tried switching and it was still the same.,8978,1
8978,I had only a few days to replace them seeing as how they were a week late arriving after paying for expedited shipping .,8978,1
8978,They were pretty just don't expect them to fit correctly or be on time!,8978,1

9015,"Description should state ""Fitted Look""",9015,1
9016,Fabric is not what I expected,9016,1
9017,We ordered this for my son for his spring formal dance.,9017,1
9017,The color on the computer matched the color swatch from his dates dress.,9017,1
9017,"When it arrived, it wasn't close to the right color.",9017,1
9017,"We were trying to save money, but ended up having to get one from the tux store instead.",9017,1

9020,Sleeves are very short .,9020,1
9021,Totally not what it looks like in the pic.,9021,1
9021,Cheap material not worth the money,9021,1
9022,The shape and appearance of this bag is great!,9022,1
9022,The guality of the synthetic leather and fabric inside are cheaply made and this is visible.,9022,1
9022,The hardware broke in 1.5 months of use.,9022,1
9022,I purchased on February 28th.,9022,1
9022,It's April 15th!,9022,1

9022,Sad!,9022,1
9022,I love the bag design!,9022,1
9022,Back to fossil for me!,9022,1

9023,Total crap.,9023,1
9024,This thing is slim but the magnet in the flap that is supposed to hold your cash and cc's is useless.,9024,1
9024,It couldn't hold a piece of paper to the fridge.,9024,1
9024,That's why I bought it.,9024,1
9024,It would be much better if it was spring loaded.,9024,1
9025,It is rather blah on your wrist.,9025,1
9025,Manly looking.,9025,1
9026,This skirt will be returned.,9026,1
9026,It had a fishy smell and was not even close to ivory.,9026,1

9029,Terrible.,9029,1
9029,"First of all, the are made from a material similar to polyester and are made small.",9029,1
9029,"The odd thing is, the longer you wear them , the more they stretch, especially the waistband.",9029,1
9029,These are strechy pants not jeans and they rise up in the ankle area.,9029,1
9029,Definitely wouldn't work for s tall person.,9029,1
9029,I was very disappointed,9029,1

9031,Wasn't able to wear it at all.,9031,1
9032,"After waiting 40 days for my order (seriously the slow boat from China), I got the wrong size, wrong design, and this shirt it tight in the hips and I have small legs and average hips.",9032,1
9032,"My search was for COTTON shirts, which is what I thought I ordered, but it is 100% polyester.",9032,1
9032,It's like wearing a shower curtain in the summer.,9032,1
9032,There are no bust darts so it fits like a bag.,9032,1
9032,The seam edges are roughly finished.,9032,1
9032,A hideous product.,9032,1

9034,Very small and cheap!!,9034,1
9034,Very unhappy with this purchase!!!,9034,1
9034,Nothing like what the picture looks like.,9034,1
9035,Wouldn't refund shipping amount..only will replace if mailed back which means you'll pay for shipping twice more.,9035,1
9035,Shirt size chart is incorrect on seller page so buy a size smaller.,9035,1
9035,The picture is misleading it looks dark charcoal gray with hot pink letters my shirt was light gray even after clicking on dark and my lettering was very soft pink...shirt thread came undone and faded after first wash even following wash instructions.,9035,1
9036,Had to send it back has a bad order smells like 5 bags of grass starter ferlitzer had to was my neck 3 times to remove the order it left on my neck,9036,1

9043,Complete s***,9043,1
9044,This is AWFUL.,9044,1
9044,"The suit itself is very loose fitting but the bra in it is super small, SUPER SMALL.",9044,1
9044,"The bra fits up to a C cup, MAYBE.",9044,1
9044,"As a plus size woman, this is a terrible fit.",9044,1
9044,I am very disappointed in this.,9044,1
9045,Smells like cow feces when it came out of the package.,9045,1
9045,I have no clue who on earth could even fit these.,9045,1
9045,"I gave them to my ten year old sister, but she couldn't even wear them because of the foul smell (that wouldn't leave even after 5 washes).",9045,1

9049,This isn't worth 13 if it's not going include everything .,9049,1
9049,Received a lot of duplicates also,9049,1
9050,These are just amber-tinted sunglasses.,9050,1
9050,Colored plastic.,9050,1
9050,True blue-blocking sunglasses will block blue light.,9050,1
9050,"When you put them on, anything that is the color blue will actually appear as various shades of gray.",9050,1
9050,"You put these on, and there is no difference in color when looking at blue objects.",9050,1
9050,"When they claim these are blue-blocker sunglasses, they are lying to you.",9050,1
9050,I am returning these for a full refund.,9050,1
9050,I am reporting these idiots to Amazon for scamming people.,9050,1

9051,Very small.,9051,1
9052,Fit is too snug.,9052,1
9052,Not sized correctly at all.,9052,1
9053,"When I first opened the package I noticed it came with a hard case and a bag case, which was nice.",9053,1
9053,"The first door I wore these, I was by my pool.",9053,1
9053,These glasses did not block to sun at all and made anything in the sun look dark and hard to see.,9053,1
9053,"When someone was walking up to me, you can only see their outline, not their face or any details of them.",9053,1
9053,"These glasses are cute, but you can't wear them on a sunny day.",9053,1
9054,Very unhappy with product,9054,1
9055,No the color was not expected to be that bright,9055,1
9056,Avoid at all costs.,9056,1
9056,I trusted a review that said it worked for them.,9056,1
9056,"Should have known better, when I  saw it would take 8 weeks to ship from China.",9056,1
9057,Very beautiful except that the colors are nothing like it is in the picture:( the pink ones in the picture aren't pink at all when i got them they're white.,9057,1
9057,Very disappointed but i guess I'll keep em.,9057,1
9058,I did not like and very small,9058,1
9059,Bought as a gift and bought a size bigger (large) because she likes her clothes loose fitting but it was more like a size small.,9059,1
9059,Sleeves are super short too and poor quality,9059,1
9060,The fabric on this blouse was awful !,9060,1
9060,stiff and just plain weird feeling.,9060,1
9060,I had purchased this blouse in an orange color and loved it.,9060,1
9060,But the fabric on this black one was totally different.,9060,1
9061,I read the reviews that said this fell apart quickly and even with the 1st use.,9061,1
9061,"I purchased it anyway since it had a great price, quick shipping,  and I knew I could repair it.",9061,1
9061,"However, it came not only coming apart, but bunched up and wrinkled as if it'd had dried in little ball.",9061,1
9061,"I steamed it, and will have to try to glue it while trying to re-clamp the clamp.",9061,1
9061,Definitely not a ready to use without worry product.,9061,1
9061,"I feel badly writing negative review, but can't help that that's what happened.",9061,1
9062,Thin and doesn't look like the picture,9062,1
9063,Not what was expected.,9063,1
9064,"Looks nice in the picture, but is not solid, it is empty, very weak, the weight of the rose could be less than 1 gr, broke very fast, very disappointing.",9064,1
9064,I bought for my sister and it last a few days,9064,1
9065,After one nights use our son appears to have received some kind of chemical burn or severe allergic reaction on his wrist.,9065,1
9065,"Admittedly we did not wash them before first use (don't recall if the instructions say we should either) but still, pretty scary all things considered.",9065,1
9065,"The attached photo speaks for itself (it was taken about 24 hours after we first noticed the injury, so it's definitely not just some kind of ""sleep mark"").",9065,1
9065,We will be returning these promptly.,9065,1
9066,Returned for larger size,9066,1
9067,was so small and i ordered a size bigger than i usually wear,9067,1
9068,"This shirt is the ugliest piece of clothing I have ever seen, made from the lowest quality materials I have ever seen.",9068,1
9068,It looks nothing like the picture.,9068,1
9068,The return policy is such that it costs more to send it back than it was purchased for.,9068,1
9068,"This product and company are exactly why people are, and should, be hesitant to buy clothing online.",9068,1
9068,"The quality is so poor that you can't even use it as a rag, it might work as sandpaper.",9068,1
9069,This dress was not a 3x!,9069,1
9069,It's like a size 5!,9069,1
9070,Really ashamed that the sizing chart did not accurately estimate sizes.,9070,1
9070,However that is partially my fault.,9070,1
9070,The fabric is chiffon and true to Asian sizes.,9070,1
9071,this states its a two piece and it was not.,9071,1
9071,"low quality, i should of know due to the price.",9071,1
9072,Extremely poorly made dress.,9072,1
9072,Upon opening the package we discovered the dress was made from very thin and cheap material.,9072,1
9072,There were several frays and ripped seams.,9072,1
9072,I do not recommend wasting money on these products.,9072,1
9073,"The cost of the item was very inexpensive, however you cannot go by the sizing chart.",9073,1
9073,I did & mine is extremely  to big on me.,9073,1
9073,I cannot wear it.,9073,1
9073,The coast to return it is more than the item itself.,9073,1
9073,I would rather do without all together.,9073,1
9074,These are beautiful but didn't look good in the ear.,9074,1
9074,"They didn't ""sit"" right in the ear.",9074,1
9074,They kept faking which made them look like a weird dangle earring.,9074,1
9074,Returned,9074,1
9075,Ordered a 3x and was like a medium,9075,1
9076,This swimsuit is not measured true to size,9076,1

9077,"Although I am not satisfied, I don't want to waste time with a return, just wanted to let the possible customers know ...",9077,1
9077,Thanks anyways.,9077,1
9078,This is a disco shirt version of a pullover.,9078,1
9078,"If it weren't for the print being so cute, I'd send it back.",9078,1
9078,Not good for warmth.,9078,1
9078,The sleeves have cuffs and the fabric is shiny.,9078,1
9078,Took me right back to the 1970s.,9078,1
9078,"This may not be a turnoff for others, but it is for me.",9078,1
9079,The shoulder strap is too small and it's too thin and it just looks cheap.,9079,1
9079,Don't buy it.,9079,1
9080,Don't waste your money.,9080,1
9080,Its not a sweatshirt at all and the sleeves aren't sewn right.,9080,1
9080,And the pockets aren't really pockets.,9080,1
9080,The sellers won't give a refund.,9080,1
9081,Uggg these socks broke the the first day!!,9081,1
9081,Nothing more annoying than socks falling under your heel in your shoe.,9081,1
9082,Really upset a waste of money.,9082,1
9082,One arm was longer then the other.,9082,1
9082,Like how does that happen?,9082,1
9083,Do not buy!,9083,1
9083,"Had holes in the dress, cheap belt.",9083,1
9083,"It should probably be worn as a shirt, way too short.",9083,1
9084,Looks nice in the picture.,9084,1
9084,Looks like cheap crap when you get it.,9084,1
9084,Do NOT buy this!,9084,1
9085,cheap looking,9085,1
9086,Completely different shirt than what is in the photo.,9086,1
9087,came late and did not fit as described at all.,9087,1
9088,"The dress was too small, and color looked faded compared to the picture.",9088,1
9089,Poor quality.,9089,1
9089,Made wide in the hips.,9089,1
9089,Boobs hung out too much.,9089,1
9090,Looks and fits nothing like the picture.,9090,1
9091,Showed up broken.,9091,1
9092,Completely see though and the color is brighter red than shows here.,9092,1
9092,"Seller did not want to negotiate a return, disappointing all the way around.",9092,1
9092,"It is cheap and itchy material, at good will now if you want one!",9092,1
9093,"I disliked this product, it was the wrong color size was smaller and the sequins were falling off with me just pulling it out of the wrapping it came in.",9093,1
9094,Fell apart after 1 day.,9094,1
9094,Sole came completely off.,9094,1
9095,This shirt is hideous.,9095,1
9095,It looks nothing like the picture and has a seem down the front of the shirt.,9095,1
9095,"The empire waist sits at the right place on my body, but it's too wide across my shoulders so the top of the shirt fluffs up like a balloon, but the arms are sewn so that they're sort of twisted over the upper part of my arm.",9095,1
9095,"They don't sit straight on my body even when my hands are down, they twist the fabric like it's wrapping sideways around my arm.",9095,1
9095,"Also, in the picture, you see the woman wearing the shirt has the empire waist under  her bust, and then the bottom of the shirt is flowy over her belly and is long over her jeans.",9095,1
9095,"This shirt does not have that length, in fact the bottom half of the shirt is shorter than the top part and barely reaches the top of my pants.",9095,1
9095,Another weird thing about the sleeves is that the little elastic area round the wrist isn't even elastic.,9095,1
9095,"It's cinched up, but it's REALLY wide.",9095,1
9095,"Like, almost a belled sleeve.",9095,1
9095,It's awful.,9095,1
9095,"Also, I ordered a size 8, but the tag doesn't say 8, it says XL.",9095,1
9095,"That's fine since sizes may be relatable, but I don't think the sizing information is accurate.",9095,1
9095,"This is definitely bigger than a size 8 in the bust (and I did use measurement in the ad to determine the size to buy) and in the bottom of the sleeves, but much smaller than an 8 in length and in the upper sleeves.",9095,1
9095,It just doesn't sit right on the body.,9095,1
9096,Bad watch,9096,1
9097,"It's too small, the size is incorrect.",9097,1
9097,I'm just posting this so other customers won't waist there time & money.,9097,1
9098,"I orderd Xlarge and was way to small, If it is cashmir it sucks...more like wool",9098,1
9099,overpriced.,9099,1
9100,Terrible not a good look once you have it when you place it on your wrist it does not look like the way it looks in the photo disappointed,9100,1
9101,This item was incredibly undersized.,9101,1
9101,I followed the size guide and even ordered a size up based on other reviews that said it ran small.,9101,1
9101,It still didn't even come close to fitting.,9101,1
9101,I had to return it.,9101,1
9102,Only one of the lenses on my polarized sunglasses was actually polarized while the other remained the same.,9102,1
9102,It makes for regular activities very distracting.,9102,1
9102,Will be returning the product.,9102,1
9103,button holes are all coming apart..,9103,1
9104,"Not happy, requesting return",9104,1
9105,I am very angry and will never spend money with this company again.,9105,1
9105,They did not ship me what I ordered.,9105,1
9105,Since I had previously ordered this product several times before; I know what they look like.,9105,1
9105,"They changed the design, the colors and the quality of the fabric used but still show the old picture of the underwear that is no longer accurate.",9105,1
9105,"Also, the quality of the underwear has changed dramatically for the worse.",9105,1
9105,The fabric used to be thicker and softer and very good quality.,9105,1
9105,Not anymore!,9105,1
9105,"Now, it is quite thin and scratchy feeling.",9105,1
9105,Extremely disappointed with my purchase!,9105,1
9106,Fit was absolutely terrible,9106,1
9107,"The texture is really rough, especially the knot, always damage my shirts.",9107,1
9108,"Beautiful belt, but it fell apart right away.",9108,1
9108,I have purchase better quality belts from Dollar General for 5 bucks!,9108,1
9109,Looks nothing like the picture I received a shorty top and it was too tight.. Not very happy with this purchase.,9109,1
9110,It doesn't fit like the picture..,9110,1
9110,I am size small..,9110,1
9110,It fits me well but doesn't look like picture at all..,9110,1
9111,Not as pictured.,9111,1
9111,There was a chemical smell to the material that was overwhelming.,9111,1
9111,No label on the garment at all.,9111,1
9111,I was not comfortable in gifting it to anyone I knew or donating it.,9111,1
9111,re-bagged twice and threw it away.,9111,1
9112,Questioning if real leather as it does not smell like leather...,9112,1
9113,I believe I was sent the wrong size because this is four times smaller then said it was.,9113,1
9113,But the fabric is gorgeous.,9113,1
9113,Would have been nice if it was kind of stretchy but that's okay.,9113,1
9113,It is now become my skinny dress.,9113,1
9113,Goals.,9113,1
9113,Lol,9113,1
9114,The drop on the handle is entirely too short.,9114,1
9114,"Let me put it this way, it wouldn't be long enough for a little person.",9114,1
9114,I am confused as to why a drop on a bag of this size would be so short.,9114,1
9114,Why can't designers get this right.,9114,1
9114,At least give buyers the option for longer handles.,9114,1
9114,So annoying.,9114,1
9115,Ordered a medium because I know I have a bigger butt.,9115,1
9115,The top is super flimsy and I wish there could've been a choice to order a small for the top and medium for the bottoms.,9115,1
9115,"When I tried to adjust it to make the top tight, the back part goes up way too high and just looks weird.",9115,1
9115,"And when you make the straps more loose, then the front part looks flimsy and not right.",9115,1
9115,My bra size is 32B so having a smaller chest didn't fill in the top enough to where it wouldn't be flimsy.,9115,1
9115,"Cute, but not for me",9115,1
9116,"The earrings are beautiful, however, the clasp is flimsy.",9116,1
9116,I would not recommend these.,9116,1
9117,cheap returned them one of the lenses was out when we rec.,9117,1
9117,them could not get it to go back in.,9117,1
9118,"Way, way, way too small.",9118,1
9119,Poor quality and sizing is off.,9119,1
9119,This dress will be returned.,9119,1
9120,"I ordered this in white, extra extra large.",9120,1
9120,It came in gray and what seems to be an extra extra small.,9120,1
9120,What a rip off.,9120,1
9121,They came in and I spent 5-10 minutes trying to open them.,9121,1
9121,"Once I get them halfway in my ear you can't fit the other piece in, it just won't go back and then I notice the other ones bottom piece won't come out.",9121,1
9121,There too cheap to return too.,9121,1
9121,Such a shame I was really excited for them.,9121,1
9121,They poke your ear really bad too.,9121,1
9121,"And the pieces are so small they slip out of your finger, took forever for them to come.",9121,1
9121,Will not order from this seller again,9121,1
9122,The material is much thicker than expected.,9122,1
9122,More like a sweater as appose to silk and beach attire appropriate.,9122,1
9123,Horrible and cheap quality!,9123,1

9131,"I wear smalls and mediums and it was tight on me--not skin tight, but not comfy either.",9131,1
9131,"Also, I am 5""1' yet the sleeves didn't reach my hands...Id say they are more like quarter sleeves.",9131,1
9131,"All in all the sweater should not be labeled ""Women's"" or ""loose.""",9131,1

9196,My head circumference is 22 inches and my hair is medium thick.,9196,1

9197,It fit weirdly and was too long and narrow.,9197,1
9197,"The colour was technically accurate, but that's about it.",9197,1

9202,Major disappointment!,9202,1
9202,Purchased for c-section recovery.,9202,1
9202,"As the other reviews say, it fits great at first, but that fit quickly diminishes as the band bunches up with deep folds that never go away.",9202,1
9202,"It curls, it won't stay in place, it looks ridiculous under clothing that is even remotely form fitting - it is a waste of $80, and at a time when that money can go to more useful things.",9202,1
9202,The packaging offers a BS disclaimer about the folds being intentional and that is just marketing to cover their ass.,9202,1
9202,It's just a poor product.,9202,1
9202,"It may fit short waisted women with narrow hips great, but all other figures should beware.",9202,1

9212,So beware if you are purchasing this.,9212,1
9212,"Other reviews said it was long, but the one I received was far from wearable as a dress.",9212,1
9213,Need to make sure you are sending it to a adult before you send to a underage child!!!!!!,9213,1

9216,"Pretty little top, emphasis on little, nothing really like this photo except a resemblance in style.",9216,1
9216,The fabric looks substantial in the photo and it looks like there's sufficient fabric to cover the body.,9216,1

9216,The truth is the fabric is really sheer with a piece of the same fabric underneath only on the front.,9216,1
9216,The pleats look deep but they're not.,9216,1
9216,"The model looks well endowed but in this top, everybody would be able to see everything she's got.",9216,1
9216,I bought XXL but I can't get it on.,9216,1
9216,It doesn't show that the style in the back is a racerback.,9216,1
9216,"It is cut so closely and because it's so sheer, it will tear easily.",9216,1
9216,The pleats in the back are so tiny they may as well not be there.,9216,1
9216,They don't add anything except another tearing possibility.,9216,1
9216,I'm really disappointed.,9216,1
9217,Poor quality and cheap.,9217,1
9217,No stars,9217,1
9218,thin and bad stitching,9218,1
9219,"This blanket is a cheap, small, and of extremely poor quality.",9219,1
9219,The blanket is not worth $20 let alone the $50+ that I paid for it.,9219,1
9219,The blanket is rough and scratchy and the portrait printed on it is muddled and hard to make out.,9219,1

9227,When I put it on I couldn't even zip it but the lace part was huge.,9227,1
9227,The fabric was cheap also.,9227,1

9243,The cuts are way off one pair the penis slot is made for a monster another pair was made for a child and the other two fell some wear in between.,9243,1

9248,WRONG!,9248,1
9248,"The dress is two different shades of blue, the bodice lace was very heavy and not delicate like shown in the picture.",9248,1
9248,"The description said sweetheart design, but it is not, it just goes strait across the front, in fact the bodice fabric does not even go high enough to cover the chest.",9248,1
9248,"The zipper in the back is WHITE... WHITE, and can be seen through the lace on the outside.",9248,1

9255,I just received these glasses and I am absolutely disappointed.,9255,1
9255,First all it came in a dirty plastic bag.,9255,1
9255,Which at first I looked pass because the item was inside within a black cloth like back.,9255,1
9255,When I took the glasses out one of the arm extension was bent outward so I had to car fully readjust it.,9255,1
9255,On the top part of the glasses the metal that goes over the nose bridge is all scratched up.,9255,1

9509,Perhaps it's like Oakleys ... where there needs to be an Asian fit.. but these things smashed against my baby's face and left horrible red marks.,9509,1
9509,It wasn't even on tight.. just the pressure of having something around his face (like wearing glasses with nosepads).,9509,1

9516,Top section ripped at seam after 2 weeks,9516,1

9568,"I was super excited to get them, then to find that?",9568,1
9568,I was very upset.,9568,1
9568,"I think they broke because they were all shipped in the same baggy, which allowed them all to clank off of each other.",9568,1

9595,"Then I ordered a large, still too small, sizing looks to be about the same as the medium one with one additional flaw, the collar.",9595,1
9595,"The collar was so awkward looking on the Large, it's hard to describe, like there wasn't enough material used that the pointed part, instead of falling where it should be near the front collar bone, points straight out on top of my shoulders.",9595,1
9595,I don't know if either one of these are returnable.,9595,1
9595,"If you really like the style and want to give it a try, order two sizes up.",9595,1
9595,The material is some kind of polyester with a really funky smell when you first take it out if the packaging.,9595,1

9599,How sad... Today is my wife's birthday.,9599,1
9599,She has wanted diamond stud earrings since we were dating and I finally saved up enough money to get them for her to surprise her on her birthday.,9599,1
9599,"I originally was going to buy her the 1/2 carat total weight, but after seeing the size, I saved up for nearly another year to buy her the 1 carat total weight - a half carat on each ear!",9599,1
9599,"She works hard and she deserves at least that, so I pulled the trigger and got them.",9599,1
9599,"I was so excited when they finally came in, so I immediately opened up the box to see what my wife would be seeing hours later at her birthday dinner.",9599,1
9599,"Upon opening the box, I had to do a double - no, a TRIPLE take.",9599,1
9599,"I had a feeling that I'd think they were a little small, but these earrings were TINY!",9599,1
9599,"Not only tiny, but there was NO sparkle to them AT ALL!",9599,1
9599,See the pictures and YOU be the judge.,9599,1
9599,"I went to my laptop to read the description of these earrings, as maybe I misread what the size should be for 1 carat total weight, or a half carat each.",9599,1
9599,"I found the description (see picture, attached) that said these should have a height of 0.18 inches (4.572 mm) and a width of 0.18 inches (also 4.572 mm).",9599,1
9599,I also attached a photo to show the conversion of inches to millimeters from Google.com for you all.,9599,1
9599,"Well, I carefully measured both the height & width and the BOTH were MUCH SMALLER than 4.5 mm!!",9599,1
9599,(see THOSE pictures too!).,9599,1
9599,The width of the diamond was just UNDER 3mm & the height was only 2mm!!,9599,1
9599,I could not believe it!,9599,1
9599,Do these people really think that we as consumers are that stupid?,9599,1
9599,"Oh, and the color, clarity of the diamond is awful as well.",9599,1
9599,"I know that these aren't the Hope diamond, or from Tiffany's, but I at LEAST wanted them to sparkle for her.",9599,1
9599,"And if you see the last picture I posted, you'll know that they didn't even sparkle...",9599,1
9599,I really felt awful and I had no back-up gift because I spent all my saved extra money for her gift on these pathetic excuses for diamond earrings.,9599,1
9599,"I've been burned by Amazon in the past a couple of times, but it was always by their outside vendors.",9599,1
9599,"This time though, the ONE time I counted on Amazon to fulfill my wishes of getting exactly what was described, I got burned by them.",9599,1
9599,"Needless to say, I am returning these immediately.",9599,1
9599,Do yourselves a BIG self service and go out and buy your earrings from a reputable jeweler where you can see before you buy.,9599,1

9638,"I don't know how they decided that this is a 3X, maybe in children's size.",9638,1

9700,This doesn't specify they were made in China until after you buy them.,9700,1
9700,It has a metal frame that is very shiny.,9700,1
9700,"Just about any metal made in China that is shiny is made with cadmium or chromium, elements just as toxic as lead but unregulated.",9700,1

9701,Looks difference,9701,1

9705,CHEAP!!!!!!!!!,9705,1
9705,Threw it out!,9705,1
9706,the photo is misleading.,9706,1
9706,It wastes buyers time.... it would be far better to sell in pairs (duh) and put the correct price.,9706,1
9706,Seriously unimpressed with the shyster trickery.,9706,1
9706,I would happily have bought two HAD I KNOWN.,9706,1

9707,"Too bad, because they got the aesthetics right.",9707,1
9708,"Bad quality , too small,ugly colors",9708,1
9709,I got the XL so I could have a loose fit.,9709,1
9709,It's a normal t-shirt with a zipper on the back.,9709,1
9709,"Given the fit, complete waste of $.",9709,1
9709,Do NOT recommend.,9709,1
9710,Ripped the first time it was worn,9710,1
9711,"Fabric is awful, nothing like the picture.",9711,1
9712,The picture is gold and I got mailed a silver necklace.,9712,1
9713,Wish I returned this.,9713,1
9713,Poor quality.,9713,1
9713,No wonder it's cheap.,9713,1
9713,You definitely get what you paid for.,9713,1
9713,Too late to return.,9713,1
9713,I bought it as a backup.,9713,1
9713,"Now that I actually used it, I realized how bad the workmanship is.",9713,1
9713,Sigh.,9713,1
9713,Learn from mistake not to buy cheap products.,9713,1

9720,But once I received it.,9720,1
9720,I was upset.,9720,1
9720,"The material is so see thru, it's so thin.",9720,1
9720,I put on the bottoms and you could see my but crack.,9720,1
9720,Not what I had in mind to go swimming.,9720,1
9720,"The top was a little better, but for the life of me can figure out how to make it stay in place.",9720,1
9720,I keep having nip slips just trying it on at home.,9720,1
9721,Had it on for an hour & it started ripping very cheap quality,9721,1
9722,they run very small not happy with this,9722,1
9723,Don't buy this cheap made in wherever cheap knock off.,9723,1
9723,"This shirt sucks, the color is a mix of pink and peach, try wearing that to bike night.",9723,1
9724,"Love the logo, and great quality!",9724,1

9858,Quality has gone way down.,9858,1

9859,XL would fit a child.,9859,1
9860,"When I got it, it was all bent up couldn't wear it",9860,1

9861,Not at all what I expected!,9861,1
9861,I had to send it back.,9861,1
9862,I didn't realize it was only sharpie on,9862,1

9864,Pure garbage.,9864,1
9864,I ordered blue and they look more like purple.,9864,1
9864,The diamond is ginormous to the point where it is so obviously fake it looks ghetto.,9864,1
9864,One of the posts barely catches so it's easy to lose an earring with ease.,9864,1
9864,Took forever for these to arrive.,9864,1
9864,Shipped from China so not worth sending back.,9864,1
9864,I'm just glad I'm not out of too much money.,9864,1
9865,Threw out wouldn't stay on,9865,1

9868,Not satisfied,9868,1

9883,"Then, after the first wash it shrunk a lot.",9883,1
9883,Much more than I thought it should have.,9883,1

9896,GARBAGE,9896,1
9897,I am so disappointed.,9897,1
9897,This was a flimsy plastic mask that easily tore.,9897,1
9897,"It did not come with batteries and when I spent $12 on batteries, one eye did not light up.",9897,1
9897,Total cost $32 for a broken mask.,9897,1

9901,I placed the order for a 4x..,9901,1
9901,Which would have been a little large just to make sure it would fit... My 11 year old granddaughter who is a child size 10/12 loves the suit...,9901,1
9901,I am not happy and won't be ordering any clothing too soon again,9901,1
9902,I got a large which is a size bigger than I normally get in case of shrinkage or whatever the length was nice but for whatever reason right in the hip area it got super tight and couldn't even get it to zip up.,9902,1
9902,There was also stitching coming out all over the place and I washed it on cold inside out and even dried with no heat and the logos still ripped off so all in all a waste of $20 something.,9902,1

9915,I'm sending it back!,9915,1
9916,Don't Bother.,9916,1
9916,"Arrived missing stones and with others discolored and ugly yellow/brown, presumably because of the glue used to adhere them.",9916,1

9917,I ordered this in a 2xl and it wouldn't even fit my 6 year old child.,9917,1

9967,That's why they are so lightweight.,9967,1
9967,"The wood seems like a good idea, but it has no flex.",9967,1

9977,"I never write reviews, but am very frustrated about this as I've never had difficulty with returns from Amazon.",9977,1
9978,This tank top is not at all the right style of strap advertised.,9978,1
9978,"Took forever to get here, then it ends up being WAY too small.",9978,1
9978,I ordered a medium and in reality I should've ordered an extra large if I wanted this to fit correctly.,9978,1

10121,Bust is very stiff and very lopsided.,10121,1
10121,Overlay is cheap and hem at bottom is too long and very jagged you can see cut marks.,10121,1

10122,Very cheap quality not worth the price I paid,10122,1
10123,"Material doesn't really form to the shape, maybe I bought it too small but it didn't really look good.",10123,1

10131,Too heavy,10131,1
10132,The rubber band around the metal sleeves is so tight that it's impossible to put even three cards in without jamming them together.,10132,1
10132,This product needs work.,10132,1
10133,The bottom is fitted with a wire to help the dress keep its shape.,10133,1
10133,"That might work if you bought it off a hanger, but cramming it in a box bent the wire out of shape and we couldn't get it to look nice.",10133,1
10133,It fits strange too.,10133,1
10133,Big around the arm holes and my daughter is neither flat chested nor busty.,10133,1

10151,Wooden Cross has a small chipped at the end.,10151,1
10152,The part that clips on falls off easily.,10152,1
10152,I recommend a smaller version of this product.,10152,1

10159,"It fits like a sack, the fabric is cheap and the decal is shiny like a sticker.",10159,1
10159,The baby logo hangs over the crotch too so it's super awkward.,10159,1

10169,After my initial review I was notified that this is an exact copy of an outfit made by a handmade brand :( I had no idea.,10169,1
10169,Not cool to steal designs and VERY NOT cool to use photos of other people's children to advertise your knockoffs,10169,1
10170,"I loved the design on the t-shirt, as did my husband, but he's a big boy and the XXXL I ordered for him was waaaaay to small.",10170,1
10170,It said XXXL on the tag - it is more between an American woman's size Large and XL.,10170,1
10170,Disappointing.,10170,1

10175,!,10175,1
10176,I ordered an XL and what I received was NOT an extra large.,10176,1

10179,Even the arms were tight.,10179,1
10179,Like cartoon small!,10179,1

10180,This one is still a bit big and floppy.,10180,1
10181,"AWFUL, The packaging was awful when opened.",10181,1
10181,I ordered specifically a small and they sent a large.,10181,1
10181,The material is deceiving from the eye online but in person has the material of synthetic  rain coat.,10181,1
10181,I was expecting cloth.,10181,1
10181,I recommend NOT purchasing this item unless you want it to feel ultra cheap.,10181,1
10182,poor durability,10182,1
10183,"This fit well, and is very pretty, but the material is very very thin, almost see through.",10183,1
10183,"I wouldn't even have taken off for that, cause I bought it with the intent to wear around the house, on hot days.",10183,1
10183,"But what I had to take off a lot of points for is, terrible quality.",10183,1
10183,"Every seam, or stitching on this dress has loose threads, fraying threads, or  a lack of a finishing edge.",10183,1
10183,"This wasn't bought with the intent to go out in, it was to be a around the house play with the kids dress, on a hot day.",10183,1
10184,"First of all, sizing printed on packaging doesn't correspond to size chart / choices listed online.",10184,1
10184,So I took a chance buying these.,10184,1

10185,"A lot of it is from China and the it's doesn't fit you unless your all skin and bones,petite ,or super thin.",10185,1
10185,"People with a body type of avenge ,chubby ,etc it' won't fit no matter what size you select.",10185,1
10185,They measure their clothes differently from Americans.,10185,1
10186,"If you are looking for a cheap poorly made hat, you have found it.",10186,1
10186,This is basically a 50 cent hat with crooked lettering and an unbelievably thin bill.,10186,1
10186,"After wearing on 2 occasions for a total of 3 hours, the back of the hat broke and is now garbage.",10186,1
10186,I didn't expect a New Era top of the line hat for $ 8.99 but I did expect it to last until the election and had reasonable expectations that the lettering would not be crooked.,10186,1
10186,"Waste of money, time and am hard pressed to believe Amazon.com is allowing such garbage to be sold on its website.",10186,1
10187,Looks nothing like picture,10187,1

10196,"Way too tight and nothing like the picture, the skirt isn't even sewn to have that much flair--more of a tight mini dress fit.",10196,1
10197,Awful.,10197,1
10197,Size was ridiculously small and the quality was beyond poor.,10197,1
10197,Never again.,10197,1

10281,I guess if they had a 3x extra long then it may fit lol but I'm not really tall at all Abt average (5'4) hope this helps someone who wants an honest review & opinion.,10281,1
10281,"If your a toned skinny girl just lookin to have some extra cover or help give the perfect hour glass shape this will b fine for you, but if your a girl who is looking for help with that baby pooch or just a lil belly pooch in general something to show your curves more & flatten out that belly this item is NOT for you!",10281,1

10384,Thank you for asking about my feedback.,10384,1
10384,Happy Holiday!,10384,1

10388,"It's heavy and for some inexplicable reason, it comes covered in plastic that extends all the way into the edges of the suitcase, which I didn't notice until after my first trip with it.",10388,1
10388,It is IMPOSSIBLE to fully remove the plastic from the edges and it looks absolutely terrible.,10388,1

10393,The color was more like a maroon or wine and I was expecting the hot pink from the photo or something close to that.,10393,1
10394,The bottoms are stiff and do not fit at all.,10394,1
10394,It's comparable to cutting a piece of foam in the shape of underwear and putting them on.,10394,1
10394,The top was shaped oddly.,10394,1
10394,I'm a 32 DDD and I got the medium.,10394,1
10394,"The band fit fine, but the cups just sat so strangely that it was unflattering.",10394,1

10412,This Wantdo jacket is a WOMEN's jacket.,10412,1
10412,The zipper and buttons are on opposite (left) side.,10412,1
10412,Men's garments have the zipper fastener and buttons on the right side.,10412,1
10412,I looked at all of their images for their many of their other products and they all appear to be on the wrong side as well.,10412,1
10412,This is the only one that I have personal experience with though.,10412,1
10412,"Also keep in mind that the color was very different, it was much darker almost an orange color.",10412,1
10413,"To begin with, what I ordered was a pair of wide leg pants( as pictured).",10413,1
10413,"Instead, one month later, I receive this flimsy, awful striped sweatshirtish thing.",10413,1
10413,This is the first and last time I am purchasing something non amazon Prime.,10413,1
10413,I will expect a prompt refund and will update my review accordingly.,10413,1
10414,No problems with the seller but I was so disappointed in the necklace.,10414,1
10414,"The description led me to believe this was a woman's necklace ""elegant enough to wear to a wedding"", but it was man sized, almost 3"" by 2"" hanging on an approximately 1/4"" thick chain rope that looked very masculine, except for the stones.",10414,1
10414,I would never wear this.,10414,1
10414,I expected it to be about 1/3 the size!,10414,1

10419,It's thin and really just a piece of junk.,10419,1
10419,Totally wish I wouldn't have bought this and will probably not buy anything like this off Amazon again.,10419,1
10420,Not long enough,10420,1
10421,The item I ordered was supposed to be a combination of both AA and AAA batteries (as the product title and description both read) but only AAAs arrived.,10421,1
10421,Where are my AAs?,10421,1
10422,This print was different from the other two pairs I ordered.,10422,1
10422,They ripped on the first time I wore them.,10422,1
10422,Very disappointed because I liked them very much and my other two pairs have been great.,10422,1
10423,Colors were true to the picture but I got a medium and the sleeves are three times too wide.,10423,1
10423,Also this shirt is incredibly cheaply made.,10423,1
10423,Don't waste your money on it,10423,1
10424,Not true to size.,10424,1
10424,Returned,10424,1

10429,"very bad item
It is waste of money indeed
It looks like not like the photos when it was delivered

very bad",10429,1
10430,Worst purchase ever!,10430,1
10430,"Poor material cheaply made, seams not properly tucked in and skirt straps were too loose.",10430,1
10430,I didn't like it.,10430,1
10431,I will no longer purchase any clothing from Amazon.,10431,1
10431,I have purchased 4 different items of clothing over the past couple of years.,10431,1
10431,ALL were ridiculously small.,10431,1
10431,"I checked the size chart, looked at reviews that said the item ran small and ordered a larger size but the item was still too small to be comfortable to wear.",10431,1
10432,This is the worst item I have bought on Amazon so far.,10432,1
10432,The bag is totally different from the picture.,10432,1
10432,The quality is 2%.,10432,1
10432,The material is below cheap.,10432,1
10432,"As I was trying to take off the wrap on the handle, the handle tore out of the sewing and is almost out.",10432,1
10432,There were many other things I disliked about this product.,10432,1
10432,1.,10432,1
10432,"The cross body strap felt like it was going to fall apart within the first couple of uses, it was so thin.",10432,1
10432,2.,10432,1
10432,"There was issue with the interior lining of the bag, the fabric they used as so rough and flimsy, you could clearly see through it.",10432,1
10432,3.,10432,1
10432,"This bag was smaller than anticipated and made with cheaper materials because when I picked up the box, it felt like I was only picking up the weight of the box.",10432,1
10432,4.,10432,1
10432,The material on the middle of the front side of the bag picked up lint really easily.,10432,1
10432,"In addition, there was a large crease on the back of the back that would not smooth out.",10432,1
10432,"Overall, the material everywhere was way too thin to be usable for more than a month.",10432,1
10432,I am currently in the process of returning this item .,10432,1
10432,Really poor quality.,10432,1
10432,I am disappointed!,10432,1
10433,"The reason for the negative feedback is because I did not receive the knotted headbands, I received these strange headbands with random things on them.",10433,1
10433,I am more of a simple person and likes the plain look of the headbands and received something completely different.,10433,1
10433,I tried to contact the seller and did not receive a response.,10433,1
10433,"The quality of the headband I received is fine, its just not the product described in the listing.",10433,1
10433,find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I cant hold or touch the products before buying them.,10433,1
10433,"So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item Im thinking about purchasing.",10433,1
10433,I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others  to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality).,10433,1
10433,"I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience.",10433,1
10433,"Amazon's ""Verified Purchase"" indicator shows that this review matches an actual product ordered and delivered from Amazon.",10433,1

10437,It's smaller and more stiff than I expected!,10437,1
10438,I actually love the shirt however apparently it runs big because it looked more like an XL although I ordered a medium.,10438,1
10438,I returned it with the intention of reordering a smaller size however the return was self return and it cost me over $9.00 to return therefore I will not be reordering because I would have paid much more than I wanted to for the shirt.,10438,1
10438,Bummer.,10438,1
10438,I really loved the shirt.,10438,1
10439,I tried this dress twice.,10439,1

10439,This is a waste of your time,10439,1
10440,Don't like it at all!,10440,1
10440,I definitely do not feel the picture tells the story.,10440,1

10444,I wore this for 2 days and the gems came out of the halo.,10444,1

10453,It shows your underwear and bra creases.,10453,1
10453,Ya might wanna wear a full body shaper underneath to smooth all that out.,10453,1
10453,I had to return mines because the quality of the dress was not what I had expected.,10453,1
10453,I thought it was going to have more of a khaki thicker quality feel to it but I guess I didn't pay too close of a attention to the product details.,10453,1
10453,"Wished I would have love the dress because it does look very cute on here but in person, not really.",10453,1
10453,:(,10453,1

10458,Everything about this shirt is awful.,10458,1
10458,"The cut is weird with some flap in the front (looks like a sewing mistake but I think it was on purpose), the material feels odd (like a cross between a windbreaker and raincoat) and the smell was so bad I just trashed it.",10458,1

10587,This product does the absolute opposite thing it's supposed to do.,10587,1
10587,"I put it on, and yes, it clinches your waist.",10587,1
10587,"But if you are like me, you are not wearing it JUST for your waist, you are wearing it as shape wear.",10587,1
10587,"Unfortunately, this does not fit the bill.",10587,1
10587,"It is too short length-wise, so when it is worn, you get unsightly bulges above and below it.",10587,1
10587,There simply is not anything more UNFLATTERING than that.,10587,1
10587,I am returning it today.,10587,1

10592,Im not a happy customer.,10592,1
10593,Way too small and horribale quality.,10593,1
10594,This is false advertising of the grossest kind.,10594,1
10594,I wear a large.,10594,1
10594,I see reviews that say these run small so I order a 2X.,10594,1
10594,I can't even get the zipper to meet in the middle.,10594,1
10594,These are so drastically mis-sized as to be useless.,10594,1
10594,You need to get into a different line of work.,10594,1
10595,it won't let me cancel the order whatever,10595,1
10596,Size for children.,10596,1

10597,I'm 5 foot 7 inches and weigh 110 pounds.,10597,1
10597,"I have no curves whatsoever, 32A bra size, long torso.",10597,1
10597,This swimsuit size large fit really weird and too big.,10597,1
10597,Reviews said to go a size larger or two but the only thing that did was make it BARELY long enough to go from my crotch to my shoulders while still covering my chest.,10597,1
10597,It was super snug from the crotch to the top of the shoulders and then ok around my chest but had this weird saggy material on the back area.,10597,1
10597,The model pictures on Amazon are a total misrepresentation of the fit.,10597,1
10597,I'm bummed because it is such a cute design!,10597,1
10597,"SO...If you have a womanly hour glass figure (treasure in your chest and junk in the trunk) with a short torso, you will probably fit this suit.",10597,1
10597,"Since I have neither and I am built like someone's little brother, this womanly swimsuit simply looked ridiculous on me.",10597,1
10598,Not what I had expected pay way too much for what I got,10598,1
10599,"OK for the price, BUT 65% polyester & 35% cotton does not= a wool hat.",10599,1
10600,How in the world did this get 4 stars?,10600,1
10600,That just blows my mind!,10600,1
10600,I regret not reading the reviews before purchasing!,10600,1
10600,The scarf looked like it was made from cheap t-shirt material and they had just chopped them off with scissors.,10600,1
10600,It's not even  hemmed!!!,10600,1
10600,Smh...,10600,1

10602,I never even got to wear it.,10602,1
10602,"I got the largest size they had, took my measurements and everything.",10602,1
10602,I even ordered a size larger than it said just in case.,10602,1
10602,I wear about an XL- 1X in US sizing and could even get it on all the way.,10602,1

10605,I loved these pants until they shrank completely in the dryer... this costed way too much to only wear twice,10605,1
10606,I was very disappointed in this product.,10606,1
10606,I had originally purchased the medium Belly Bandit for after my baby was born and loved it.,10606,1
10606,After 3 weeks it was too big so I decided to go ahead and invested in the small size because the first one was so great.,10606,1
10606,When I received the small Belly Bandit I was disappointed to find that the quality of it was not as high as the first one I had purchased.,10606,1
10606,It was made out of a much thinner material and was not as comfortable.,10606,1
10606,The tag was also not printed on the band itself like the first one and was constantly getting in the way of velcro the band.,10606,1
10606,Wish I had not wasted my money on this one.,10606,1
10607,"DO NOT BUY THIS, it is made very cheaply, AND they sent me gold instead of silver....",10607,1
10607,REALLY!!!!!,10607,1
10607,!,10607,1
10608,Ii usually wear a Medium decided to get this in a large for more roominess.,10608,1
10608,When I tried it on it was super small.,10608,1
10608,In US this would be a small not a large.,10608,1
10608,Upsize by 2 or 3 is my suggestion don't go by the size chart.,10608,1
10609,Received item broken.,10609,1
10609,Made of styrofoam.,10609,1

10613,I didn't get these.,10613,1
10613,I got a package of file folders instead and it was going to be more trouble than it was worth to try and exchange.,10613,1
10613,Not happy,10613,1
10614,Broke,10614,1

10617,Didn't  like the quality so gave it to Goodwill.,10617,1
10618,"Bad quality, it doesn't even look like the photo.",10618,1
10619,I certainly is not a XXL even though that's what the tag says.,10619,1
10620,This thing doesn't work.,10620,1
10620,I have set alarms and they do not go off and the instructions included came in every language possible except englsih.,10620,1
10621,WAY BIGGER THEN I THOUGHT.,10621,1
10621,its a very bulky hat.,10621,1
10622,The dress is absolutely not at all what is photographed.,10622,1
10622,Mine arrived  much larger than previously reviewed by others... aside from that the bodice is not at all an empire but more of a high waisted.,10622,1
10622,The bodice is cut larger than the skirt too so if you're large busted with small hips this will fit you.,10622,1
10622,The fact that its not an empire gives it a weird look on.,10622,1
10622,"Additionally, I am 5 ft 5 inches and this dress comes to my ankles.",10622,1
10622,I'm trying to decide if I will adjust the bodice by detaching and re-sewing the bodice to make it an empire...  but I will be shortening it even more by doing that so probably the best idea is just to return it.,10622,1
10622,"This will be a house dress, not to wear out and about, so I'm not so worried about the fit after I adjust it if I decide to keep rather than return.",10622,1
10622,"I'm not looking forward though, to sewing a new dress to adjust it because the manufacturer messed up and the seller misrepresented....",10622,1
10622,"If you order, do not size up like so many said and if you want it full length and you're taller than 5""6"" or want to wear this with heels, don't order.",10622,1
10622,"The fabric quality is poor also, thin and snags easily.",10622,1
10622,You get what you pay for.,10622,1
10623,This bag fell apart the first time I used it.,10623,1
10623,"The bottom ripped out and also ripped where the straps hook in
I guess it is as the saying goes.",10623,1
10623,You get what you pay for.,10623,1
10624,Not even close to labeled size.,10624,1
10624,"Took it out of packaging, washed it and had a hole in it when I took it out of washer.",10624,1
10624,"Poor quality of fabric, poor quality in sewing.",10624,1

10633,Terrible product.,10633,1
10633,Manufacturer and seller should be held liable and sued.,10633,1
10633,Metal ends are so sharp that cuts and skin break downs occur when you place bracelet on your wrist.,10633,1
10634,Poor quality!,10634,1
10635,"I have bought two of these, and they feel very nice and are very convenient.",10635,1
10635,"That said, both have broken within the year.",10635,1
10635,"Will not buy again, as the design flaw is probably known.",10635,1

10643,not as seen here color is different,10643,1
10644,Poor quality.,10644,1

10654,"I ordered a medium, and received an XXXL.",10654,1
10654,"The labels inside the jacket were faded, and barely readable.",10654,1
10654,The inside lining was ripped so that errant threads were visible.,10654,1
10654,"Additionally, there was little pieces of fluff attached to the entire inside of the jacket.",10654,1
10654,I needed a jacket by July 23rd at the latest.,10654,1
10654,"Now, I do not have a jacket",10654,1

10662,The concept is cool...,10662,1
10662,If the concept worked.,10662,1
10662,Maybe my ear rim (or whatever the proper term is called) is too thick.,10662,1
10662,This thing was impossible to put on.,10662,1
10662,I know some will have luck with it.,10662,1

10714,I was shocked.,10714,1
10714,Major wardrobe malfunction avoided.,10714,1
10714,I bought these along with 5 other pairs of capri black leggings (always on the hunt for a perfect pair) and these were by far the worst pair.,10714,1
10714,They also have a slight sheen like spandex which makes them look cheap.,10714,1
10714,Not recommended at all.,10714,1

1.",10715,1

10716,It was definitely not from me being too large for the item; they were just poorly made.,10716,1

10759,This comes in a very small size.,10759,1
10759,The arms were irregular.,10759,1
10759,It is not a one size fits all and the quality is rough to the touch.,10759,1
10759,It's shipped from Asia so it's not as easy to return.,10759,1
10759,"However, the manufacturer was polite and quickly responded to my concerns.",10759,1

10762,I bought this pair of Nike Jordan for my 10 year old son.,10762,1
10762,"He uses them regularly to go to school or play basketball, and in less than two months he showed me that the right shoe is starting to separate where the sole meats the top part.",10762,1
10762,"In a couple more days the separation was much bigger, when I told him not to use them (they are useless now anyway) until I contact the seller or amazon.",10762,1
10762,"Amazon has only 30 days return policy on them, and the seller hasn't replied yet on the fourth day now.",10762,1
10762,"I want to mention also that the shoes were only hand wiped/cleaned a few time, but never made it to the washer.",10762,1
10762,"My son has another pair of Nike athletic shoes purchased from the (Kohl's) store, costed less that this ones, is using them for a year now, and still look good (except getting small on him).",10762,1
10762,I think this particular model is made of cheap materials and looks like I am the only one that have purchased them and writing a review for them.,10762,1
10762,I really recommend to stay away from these and look for another pair.,10762,1
10763,I suspect these are fakes.,10763,1
10763,Feeling ripped off.,10763,1
10764,These aren't worth your money!,10764,1
10764,The color coating peels off and I didn't realize it until most of it was gone (meaning I ingested it).,10764,1
10764,They might be fine for a day or two of wear but nothing longer than that.,10764,1
10765,The concept of this swimsuit is nice but the execution fails to work for my female body.,10765,1
10765,"I ordered a size L (size 8-10), yet there were zero tags on the swimsuit to indicate/reassure me that I had received the size that I ordered.",10765,1
10765,The top was too large for a 36C bra size yet the bottoms were too small for a size 8 jeans.,10765,1
10765,The over tank was very large and baggy.,10765,1
10765,"Together, this would be suitable for somebody with a shape of wide shoulders and large chest with narrow hips & a tiny bottom.",10765,1
10765,"There are some where with sizing would work well, however since the top has no supporting underwire or rigid shaping, anyone with larger than a 36C bust would probably dislike the lack of support.",10765,1
10765,This will need to be returned.,10765,1
10766,I got the L. Pants were much too large for my nearly 6 year old even though I checked the size chart!,10766,1
10766,She said I am not to send them back-- she will grow into them.,10766,1
10766,I was very disappointed.,10766,1
10767,If I could give this 0 stars I would.,10767,1

10768,It broke after 3 wearings.,10768,1
10769,runs extremely small.,10769,1
10769,my 20months daughter (headsize 70 percentile) needs xxl.,10769,1

10773,Very poor material.,10773,1
10773,I am returning it.,10773,1
10773,It looked like it would of fallen apart after a week of using.,10773,1
10774,"Is not a 2x, it was maybe a large, and it was sheer, I wanted a solid black shrug not a sheer shrug.",10774,1

10785,"I wanted them foe ""SCREW"" back earrings!",10785,1
10785,Apparently these people have no clue what that means.,10785,1
10785,"They show a picture of a earring with two dents spaced apart, THAT IS NOT A SCREW BACK EARRING.. Don't make claims like ""most secure"" unless you know about all backs of earrings, you waste people's time and money and come close to false advertising.",10785,1

10797,"The construction of the product just screams cheap with the mechanisms not being sturdy at all, it makes a noise it should not make and I know this will not last very long.",10797,1
10797,Better off getting the more expensive alternatives on Amazon.,10797,1

10799,I DO NOT suggest this.,10799,1
10800,Made for a kid,10800,1
10801,It was a bell bottom jumpsuit but it appears in the picture to be straight leg.,10801,1

10804,I'm gonna see if I can't tailor it myself to be what I want.,10804,1
10804,since they are too much hassle to send back.,10804,1
10805,The color (pink) is not as the picture shows.,10805,1
10805,The pink is actually blinding neon pink.,10805,1
10805,Way too bright for my taste.,10805,1
10806,The mask came creased in half and blocky and the costume overall is just horrid.,10806,1
10806,The velcro does not even hold the back close and it's just a disaster.,10806,1
10806,The mask has way too much white on it.,10806,1

10925,"Firstly the print on the dress is not the same, it's a bad stretched out impression of the original with blurred edges and lines, looks more like ink blots than lace.",10925,1
10925,While the material is soft and silky it is transparent.,10925,1
10925,And the material has the feel that after a few washings it will start to sag and fit even looser.,10925,1
10925,Won't be wearing this anywhere but maybe as a house dress or as far as the supermarket.,10925,1

10935,This shirt is fake its not the real one,10935,1
10936,I couldn't give it negative stars...this took forever to get here and when it did arrive it was gold not silver!,10936,1
10936,I was under the impression that my wife would get extra birthstones to choose from.,10936,1
10937,Too small and inflexible!,10937,1
10938,Doesn't glow at all.,10938,1

10957,I loved the design of this tee for my little aspiring pianist.,10957,1
10957,It was however a bit larger than described.,10957,1
10957,"Which is fine because I thought he could just get more use out of it and grow into it but after just 3 washes (gentle cycle, inside out and hung to dry) the graphic is already peeling off!!",10957,1

10968,I ordered two - one with the Zelda 64 cover and one with the lightning strike kitty cat.,10968,1
10968,Both arrived very quickly but both had defective prints.,10968,1
10968,On the front of the jackets when they are closed the images do not line up at all.,10968,1
10968,It was less of an issue with the cat as he is mostly all on one side of the closure - but even then a whole cat arm is mysteriously on the left side of the jacket while the entire kitty is on the right.,10968,1
10968,The Zelda 64 one was just too bad to keep so I had to ask for a refund on that one - we'll see how that goes.,10968,1
10968,The kitty cat will be a gift so I'm hoping the novelty of the item will overshadow the fact that there is a creepy arm just hanging out on the wrong side.,10968,1

11039,Super thin material.,11039,1
11039,"Real tight, had absolutely no give on the material.",11039,1
11039,This could probably fit a teenager it is so..... small.,11039,1
11039,Do not waste your time buying unless you have no boobs and are a size small.,11039,1
11040,This is not a shirt this can barely be considered a crop top!,11040,1
11040,The picture shows a shirt thats at least waist length.,11040,1
11040,"The so called ""shirt"" that was sent to me would barely cover the top of any woman's chest.",11040,1

11042,horrible.,11042,1
11043,The camis were suppose to be size 3x/4x and were nowhere close to the size.,11043,1
11043,"On closer look, the size was obviously cut off the tag attached to the garment and the removeable tag size M/L was covered with a 3x/4x sticker.",11043,1
11043,Makes sense on the size now.,11043,1
11043,Very much dissatisfied!,11043,1
11044,"I originally bought the DEARCASE dress in an M, it was too big.",11044,1
11044,So I returned it to purchase in a size smaller.,11044,1
11044,I saw this MOXEAY version of the dress was $5 cheaper so i decided to get it instead.,11044,1
11044,"Boy, was that a bad decision.",11044,1
11044,"This dress is 100% sheer where the other brand was not, although, visually they are identical based on the images posted here.",11044,1
11044,This should not be advertised for anything more than a beach cover up.,11044,1
11044,"There is no lining beneath the lace area in the top, the back is sheer, and the skirt is fully see-through!",11044,1
11044,Look at the pictures!,11044,1
11044,you can see my hand through the top and the bottom.,11044,1
11044,Returning this and purchasing the dearcase dress in a small.,11044,1
11045,Beautiful blouse but way to small very disappointed,11045,1
11046,This appeared to be made for a child -- it was ridiculously tiny.,11046,1
11046,I normally wear a medium and I ordered a large for the added length.,11046,1
11046,I had to return it -- there was no way I could have worn these.,11046,1
11047,The picture and description are amazing.,11047,1
11047,The actual product is not at all what is described.,11047,1
11047,The logo is faded.,11047,1
11047,The sweater color is faded.,11047,1
11047,I contacted them for a return and did not hear back.,11047,1
11047,I really would suggest that you get this product somewhere else,11047,1
11048,Cheap and ickky,11048,1
11049,There is no possible way that these were a large.,11049,1
11049,"They are a medium at best and their ""stretchy"" quality are completely incompetent.",11049,1
11049,Do not waste your money.,11049,1
11050,Itchy and stinks,11050,1
11051,Terrible.,11051,1
11051,"Buttons are weirdly placed, super jingley.",11051,1
11051,And the sizing is just weird.,11051,1
11051,Do not buy,11051,1
11052,"I'd give this ""dress"" zero stars if I could.",11052,1
11052,It looks nothing like it does in the picture.,11052,1
11052,It's more like a shirt than a dress.,11052,1
11052,"I am a tall woman, but it hit around my hips, let alone long enough to cover my rear end.",11052,1
11052,I'd advise NOT buying this.,11052,1
11052,I returned it because I was so disappointed in it.,11052,1
11053,very small .........,11053,1
11054,This product is terrible.,11054,1
11054,I ordered size large and it fits my 23 month old just below the knee.,11054,1
11054,"Also, the shirt does not have a label; therefore, I don't know the actual size of the shirt.",11054,1
11054,It came packed in the bag without any receipt or label.,11054,1
11054,Do not buy.,11054,1
11054,Terrible product.,11054,1
11055,Broke first day my 20 year old wore it..,11055,1
11055,Ridiculous!,11055,1
11055,!,11055,1
11056,I bought 2 pairs of these sunglasses for my daughters - they looked great and both girls were thrilled until the glasses broke less than 2 months after receiving them.,11056,1
11056,My daughters are not hard on things and the fact that both sets of glasses broke in the same place tells me that it was because they were cheaply made.,11056,1
11056,Don't waste your money!,11056,1
11057,You might as well wear a sheer sheet.,11057,1
11057,This was the absolute worst.,11057,1
11057,I had to return it,11057,1
11058,Did not work once received,11058,1
11059,Don't waste your money on this bag.,11059,1
11059,Handle would not close and therefore was stuck in the open position.,11059,1
11059,The only I has was to throw the bag away.,11059,1
11059,Really frustrating as I had to buy another bag overseas so I could travel back to the US.,11059,1
11060,Bottoms were WAY too small and the top was too big.,11060,1
11060,"I'm 5'3"" 130lbs and got a medium.",11060,1
11060,The color quality is terrible,11060,1
11061,it was wayway to small,11061,1
11062,Much smaller than the stated size,11062,1
11063,"Looks 10, functionality- zero.",11063,1
11063,Returned it.,11063,1
11063,Difficult to take stuff out of the bag!,11063,1
11064,Larger than mentioned plus material is very thin that it won't pass by as a dress,11064,1
11065,These unfortunately were NOT easy to get on.,11065,1
11065,"In fact, I never successfully got even one of them on my 2 1/2 year old son.",11065,1
11065,"The quality appears fine but we weren't able to use them so therefore, they were useless to us!",11065,1
11066,Small is more like girls large.,11066,1
11066,Way too small,11066,1
11067,"5""5 120lbs ordered size med
First off, quality was terrible!",11067,1
11067,"I knew it wasn't going to be great, but I expected to a get swim suit I could at least wear a couple times this season.",11067,1
11067,This one sadly won't even be making even one appearance.,11067,1
11067,"The stitching was coming undone right after opening it, it is also the wrong type of stitching - meaning it has no stretching ability to it which is needed for swim suits.",11067,1
11067,"Also the cut it so far off from the picture, I have a bit of a long torso and the bottoms ended up looking like a thong (both in back and front) while the top had no stretch to them and looked like suspenders letting my tits be on display with every small movement.",11067,1
11067,The bottoms were also sewn on crooked so the whole thing looked cockeyed.,11067,1
11067,"Wish I could return it as I can't even wear it, but the cost of shipping it back is almost as much of the suit.",11067,1
11067,Do yourself a favor and just pay the few extra bucks for a suit elsewhere.,11067,1
11068,It's very cheap looking...looks like something from the  bubble gum machine but you really can't complain for the price you get what you pay for.,11068,1
11069,Way too small....,11069,1
11070,Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap.,11070,1
11070,Turned my girls finger green,11070,1
11071,Do not buy this item!,11071,1
11071,I ignored some of the other negative posts because the prints were so amazing and they were described as oober plushy soft which they are...but they are also TRASH.,11071,1
11071,I ordered two pairs and when I wore the first pair for the first time it was at home in a chair in front of my computer for about an hour.,11071,1
11071,I will add pics to display the holes and discoloration from wearing them.,11071,1
11071,"Also, as well as holes there was a bunch of loose fibers just rolling off from touching them.",11071,1
11071,I've never seen such a crap material in my life.,11071,1
11071,I would like to add that I am 5'5 120lbs.,11071,1
11071,These one size fits all pants were even a bit loose on me.,11071,1
11071,The damage to the material occurred from sitting.,11071,1
11071,SITTING!,11071,1
11071,So basically if you intend on actually wearing these pants forget it!,11071,1
11071,Buy something else they will be ruined minutes after you put them on.,11071,1
11072,The dress did not look like the picture.,11072,1
11072,It was way to short and the fabric was very itchy.,11072,1
11072,No free shipping to send the item back.,11072,1
11072,I had to pay to ship it back.,11072,1
11073,Takes up one whole segment of my finger and I am a man.,11073,1
11073,No woman could ever wear this unless they were a Sasquatch...,11073,1
11074,"This sweater was very small in the arms, it was rather hard to move around in.",11074,1
11074,"I did enjoy the squirrel on the front, but the material wasn't comfy to wear for long periods of time.",11074,1
11074,I'm not sure I would buy this again.,11074,1
11075,I ordered this ring in 3 sizes and they all were same size.,11075,1
11075,Not one of them was accurate.,11075,1
11075,Gave them to children instead of adults.,11075,1
11075,Very small.,11075,1
11075,Sizing not accurate.,11075,1
11076,"I ordered the shorts according to their listings, two sizes larger than normal, but the legs were still very lean.",11076,1
11076,The white shorts were fairly transparent; I could see my skin tone through the legs when holding them.,11076,1
11076,Imagine if I were wearing them when they were wet.,11076,1
11077,I bought this for my grandsons 6th birthday to help him learn to tell time.,11077,1
11077,All the numbers on the outer ring rubbed off within 2 days and now it's just a watch.,11077,1
11077,Luckily he can count by 5's and can figure it out but needless to say we were both disappointed.,11077,1
11078,"This product is made out of cheap, rough material.",11078,1
11078,It isn't comfortable to wear.,11078,1
11078,After wearing the turban for two hours I noticed a large hole on the side.,11078,1
11078,It is coming apart at the seems and the fabric is tearing like paper.,11078,1
11078,I will be returning this turban.,11078,1
11078,I urge other customers to continue looking and do not settle on this product!,11078,1
11079,I read the reviews and looked at the size chart and ordered a large even though i should have been a medium!!,11079,1
11079,I love the material and layout of pockets but the pants just buttoned and they were tight on my upper legs!!,11079,1
11079,"They are also low rise so if you have a butt or big hips, you will be showing plumbers crack if you bend over!!",11079,1
11079,"I so wished they would have fit and knowing they are low rise, i will not be ordering another pair larger as i don't think it will help!",11079,1

11083,This is not cotton as it may seem.,11083,1
11083,It is a stretchy itchy material and does not look like the picture at all to me.,11083,1

11085,way too small.,11085,1
11086,"Not that great, the yellow lettering started to crack and peel quickly.",11086,1
11086,"Also, the t-shirt is considerably darker then shown in the picture.",11086,1
11086,An inflated s&h fee of $4.95 makes it not worth returning.,11086,1
11087,I'm pretty sure this wouldn't even fit a toddler.,11087,1
11087,It doesn't even look the same.,11087,1
11088,The size that was indicated was far off the mark.,11088,1

11103,I've been wearing Powerstep for over a decade because I used to have Plantar Fasciitis.,11103,1
11103,The heal of my left foot started to become sore again so I decided to replace my Powerstep insoles because they were old.,11103,1
11103,I thought this pair would be great because there was extra padding.,11103,1
11103,Long story short; Plantar Fasciitis back in both feet & tore the Plantar Fascia in right foot due to the added cushion.,11103,1
11103,II wish that I would have replaced them with the same exact Powerstep without padding.,11103,1
11103,I've been on a leave of absence from work & I have been in PT for over a month.,11103,1

11119,After 3 weeks it was too big so I decided to go ahead and invested in the small size because the first one was so great.,11119,1
11119,When I received the small Belly Bandit I was disappointed to find that the quality of it was not as high as the first one I had purchased.,11119,1
11119,It was made out of a much thinner material and was not as comfortable.,11119,1
11119,The tag was also not printed on the band itself like the first one and was constantly getting in the way of velcro the band.,11119,1

11283,"I ordered a XL I normally wear a L. It still didn't fit, mainly it was too short to me and the arms were tight.",11283,1
11283,When ibrequested a return they said they were located in China and they rather I keep it for a friend.. Don't order from sunsent if you want your item to fit right....,11283,1
11284,"I ordered this in 14g and absolutely loved it - it slipped right in, was easy to click on and off, and was aesthetically pleasing.",11284,1
11284,"With time, however, I noticed that the bar was a lot smaller than all of my other clickers and I was having trouble getting everything in my septum except for this piece of jewelery.",11284,1
11284,"Took it in to get it measured and, sure enough, this is a 16g, not a 14g.",11284,1

11294,After numerous adjustments she still wasn't able to get them to lock without help.,11294,1
11294,They were to tight to where they would pop open when she went to tip toe or too loose and the shoe would move around on her which bothered her.,11294,1
11294,The magnets picked up every small piece of metal she came across while playing.,11294,1
11294,Trying to clean them off was annoying.,11294,1

Definitely looks a lot worse in actuality and upon closer inspection it looks like I am wearing polka dots.",11315,1
11315,"Very thin fabric makes the white somewhat see-through, which is common in many shirts, but in this case, the fake lapel pocket is made so cheaply, they use a not-so-neatly-cut strip of fabric larger than the black on the front, so basically you see a strange block showing through from behind the fake pocket opening.",11315,1

11357,Looked like it was made for a child.,11357,1
11358,"First time I wore these leggings, the inseam stitching began to loosen and ""loop"" out.",11358,1

11361,It is very very thin poor quality fabric.,11361,1
11361,I'm talking like the stuff they make child's Halloween costumes out of.,11361,1
11361,The measurements aren't true to size.,11361,1
11361,I ordered a 3X and it would be a stretch to think that it would actually be more like a large.,11361,1
11361,"It is also very short, would fit more like a crop then a wide leg floor length like depicted in the picture.",11361,1
11361,I ordered this thinking it would be a fun date night outfit so disappointed.,11361,1
11362,I bought the large which was barely too small.,11362,1
11362,Then I bought the extra large and it was the same size.,11362,1
11362,My suggestion is fine a different brand that sizes them correctly.,11362,1

11363,I am a US size 10 always been.,11363,1

11365,It's plastic and not able to take any pressure.,11365,1
11366,Not at all what I was expecting.,11366,1
11366,The model and I are the same size.,11366,1
11366,"From what I received, it appears the Small is about the size of a fitted t-shirt and the size the model and I need is probably a Large or XL.",11366,1
11367,Horribly cheap looking,11367,1
11368,Received this item so tangled and knotted that I couldn't even wear it for what I ordered it for.,11368,1
11368,Gave one start because I'm required to do so just to submit it.,11368,1
11369,Don't bother with this product.,11369,1

11375,I wanted to love this shirt so much but it pilled up in a couple of hours just wearing a seatbelt!,11375,1
11375,it was very embarrassing wearing it for a Thanksgiving party and clearly seeing my seatbelt lines across my shirt and there's nothing I could do to fix it.,11375,1
11375,I didn't even bother washing it because I knew it wouldn't stand through that.,11375,1
11375,I just threw it away.,11375,1
11375,Expensive 1 time use.,11375,1
11376,"The colors are not as vibrant as in the picture, see through, and the material was more like a garbage bag.",11376,1

11377,"As in, as transparent as dark colored regular panty hose, making them completely unwearable.",11377,1
11377,I'm baffled why such tissue paper transparent material would ever be used for a pair of pants.,11377,1

11387,"I'm a size ""0"" or ""XS"" and the small fits me so I would say they run small and to size up.",11387,1

11559,Smelled like mildew,11559,1
11560,I have purchased my first 4 items and have received 3 and am having them being too small and I am losing money because I am having to pay the shipping to return them..,11560,1
11561,It was way too small unable to wear it,11561,1
11562,It's a cute shirt but it arrived without the string strap on it so I can't even wear it.,11562,1
11562,Very annoying.,11562,1
11562,Poor quality.,11562,1
11562,I would not ever buy from this seller again.,11562,1
11563,"It took nearly 8 weeks for the dress to arrive and when it did, not only did it not fit, but I found several flaws and streaks where the gown was dyed.",11563,1
11563,Had to buy another prom dress for my granddaughter as the dress would not go on her at all.,11563,1
11563,It wasn't just a little snug; it was several sizes too small.,11563,1
11563,"I ordered size 28 for her, and my friend, who wears an 18, still couldn't bring the skirt down over her hips.",11563,1
11563,That was an expensive fail.,11563,1
11564,"I helped buy this for my son who gave it to his fianc, it turned her finger green within the first week",11564,1
11565,"The fit, style and color of the shirt where good but the quality and price really killed it.",11565,1
11565,It had some defect that was noticeable from the get go.,11565,1
11565,Returned and moved on...,11565,1
11566,My most expensive and uncomfortable shoes I own..,11566,1
11567,Way too small,11567,1
11568,MUCH Smaller than advertised.,11568,1
11568,2XL fit more like XL --- not even a 1X,11568,1
11569,"This looks like a cheap, thin polyester sheet with some tassels at the bottom.",11569,1
11569,It looks cheap and feels cheap.,11569,1
11569,"For the price, I am very disappointed.",11569,1
11569,I purchased this as a gift for a friend.,11569,1
11569,I would be far too embarrassed to give this thing as a gift.,11569,1
11569,"Again, I can't stress enough that this looks so cheap!!!",11569,1
11569,The quality is about equivalent to something you would pick up at the dollar store.,11569,1
11569,I cannot believe anyone could give this more than a 1 or 2 star rating.,11569,1
11570,Broke in 3 days.,11570,1
11570,And my Adult daughter is very careful with her jewelry.,11570,1
11571,there is no seem on the bottom,11571,1
11572,Extremely thin fabric.,11572,1
11572,Cute design but I would not purchase this unless you have a full white bodysuit underneath.,11572,1
11572,Would be a cure swimsuit coverup but that's about it.,11572,1
11573,I bought one of these suits and I ordered a medium as I read other reviews that it ran small..,11573,1
11573,I got it and it was huge.,11573,1
11573,"Not only That, the top is so poorly made it looks ridiculous.",11573,1
11573,Meanwhile I got back on and ordered a small.,11573,1
11573,That was too small.,11573,1
11573,The top again was so awkward and poorly made there was no working with it.,11573,1
11573,I am typically a size small.,11573,1
11573,5'4 110 pounds.,11573,1
11573,"A size c cup and no matter what
Both tops appeared to ""fit"" but the material makes for a gap in the cup between the material and your breast.",11573,1
11573,"I wouldn't recommend, unfortunately!",11573,1
11573,I sent both back and found one at Target!,11573,1
11574,Broke first day worn.,11574,1
11575,Too small,11575,1
11576,Extreme bad quality!,11576,1
11576,Sizing is ridiculous too!,11576,1
11577,I orders a 2x it is cut like a large.. and I can't send it back,11577,1
11578,the shoes ripped from the very beginning and were very cheaply made.,11578,1
11578,I do not recommend getting these.,11578,1
11579,Doesn't fit the way the picture showed too small and I normally wear a small and I bought a large and it's still way too small.,11579,1
11579,The quality was nice but it doesn't fit like it says at all.,11579,1
11579,My friend got one too and it doesn't fit at all on her either,11579,1
11580,Ordered a large and it fits like a small,11580,1
11581,love the dress but i ordered my normal size xl and it fit like a kids xl,11581,1
11582,DONT BUY.,11582,1
11582,This product came with the words and picture faded like it wasn't made right.,11582,1
11583,Thought they were ear muffs but when I got them I realized they were bandless mitts which are really not conducive when u wear glasses.,11583,1
11583,It was my fault for not reading the description properly.,11583,1
11584,Wayyyyyyy to big and I have a big head,11584,1
11585,"Cheaply made, broke the first week I had them.",11585,1
11586,Purchased this and it arrived all bent up.,11586,1
11586,"When I contacted seller they claim in the interest of customer service/satisfaction, they wanted me to take a picture of the damage, upload and send it.",11586,1
11586,I am not techno savvy so in despair I just ate the cost because sending it back to China was cost prohibitive.,11586,1
11586,In fact I think that is a part of the ploy.,11586,1
11586,It's pretty cheap so when they ask you to jump through hoops you just walk away like I did.,11586,1
11586,So..buyer beware.,11586,1
11586,"Also, it runs very small.",11586,1
11586,"If you have a waist bigger than 24, this belt is not for you.",11586,1
11587,one size is more on the small size,11587,1
11588,The item I received is described differently than what is posted online,11588,1
11589,Coat ran 5 sizes to small.,11589,1
11589,I ordered a 54 cause that is what I wear.,11589,1
11589,I couldn't even begin to get it on.,11589,1
11589,Size was more like a 42 or 44,11589,1
11590,"THIS SHIRT I ORDERED IN A 2X AND IT WOULD FIT MY DAUGHTER WHO WEARS A SMALL, NO JOKE",11590,1
11591,Does not perform nearly as well as other cotton no iron shirts.,11591,1
11591,Wrinkles badly,11591,1
11592,Return and exchange policy sucks you have to guess like two sizes up if not more and it's not nice quality material but if it fits it looks nice,11592,1
11593,I am  sorry I bought this.,11593,1
11593,"Its size M and huge, see thru like poor fabric.",11593,1
11593,Other top ethnic I like too small.,11593,1

11594,"I then order an XL, still way to small.",11594,1
11594,I couldn't even zip the jacket up.,11594,1
11594,Thats ridiculous that I would have to order a plus size jacket because they can't make the jacket correctly.,11594,1
11595,"The black tank fit perfect, the blue and the pink were 2 inches smaller.",11595,1
11596,Garbage.,11596,1

11690,I was able to bend it mostly into the proper shape but now the metal has weakened to the point where it's kind of flimsy at the joints I bent back.,11690,1

11922,"The first day my son wore the set to church, the bow tie came apart immediately.",11922,1
11922,He barely touched it and the bow fell apart.,11922,1
11922,The suspenders lasted a few more times until the clips fell off and could not be repaired.,11922,1
11922,"The only good thing about this set was the price, but I guess you get what you pay for.",11922,1
11923,The fabric is horrible it looks so cool in the pic but it is not and they ship from China aparently so it costs a lot to send back,11923,1
11924,Only thing this sticks to is glass....if you're lucky,11924,1
11925,Beware.... X-large is definitely a small.,11925,1
11925,These T's  are very small fitting Junior sizes.,11925,1
11925,Extremely clingy.,11925,1
11926,The mittens were cute but defiantly not KIDS.,11926,1
11926,My smaller than average 5 year old couldn't fit her hand inside the mittens.,11926,1
11926,Definitely for babies or toddlers and quite disappointed as a birthday present that she had been looking forward to.,11926,1
11927,No.,11927,1
11927,Run away.,11927,1
11927,Run far away.,11927,1
11927,"I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but they either didn't read the measurements I sent or they didn't believe them.",11927,1
11927,"I'm a size 10 US, with a 36G bra.",11927,1
11927,The waist and length of the dress are perfect.,11927,1
11927,The bodice is atrocious and I don't understand on what planet this would fit anyone.,11927,1
11927,The holes for the arms are wide enough for a toddler and the seamstress must've been embarrassed by my bust size or something because the V-neck goes all the way to my neck.,11927,1
11927,I can't really tell if the bodice fits because I can't get my arms in it properly.,11927,1
11927,"Also, be warned...it really laces up in the back - that's not just a decorative element that hides a zipper.",11927,1
11927,Cinching yourself in and hoping the crepe tie stays tied is your only assurance the dress stays on.,11927,1
11927,Hopefully I can return it - custom (mis)measurements and all otherwise there went $60 down the drain.,11927,1
11928,"Too narrow....I didn't keep these

11929,This is a terrible buy!,11929,1
11929,Nothing like the pictures that it shows looks like a dyed piece of cloth!,11929,1
11930,The material that these are made of is really cheap and the rings will start to peel and all fade all to a  dingey silver.,11930,1
11930,Also the sizing is off and you cannot easily bend these to fit your nose better.,11930,1
11930,They are very cheaply made.,11930,1
11931,Cheap,11931,1
11932,This adult XL fits my 14 year old nephew perfectly.,11932,1
11932,What a joke johnnie-o!,11932,1
11932,If you're thing is going to be making things way smaller than any other product on the market then you should let your potential customers know that.,11932,1
11932,Otherwise you alienate people from garment #1.,11932,1
11932,I certainly won't be wasting my time with this company ever again.,11932,1
11932,They didn't even send any supplies for me to return the item.,11932,1
11932,What an absolute waste of my time to deal with this ridiculous shirt.,11932,1
11933,Too big,11933,1
11934,No good the mask was completely loose and wiered as for the jump suit I would recommend custom made for your size,11934,1
11935,The smart phone touch screen did not work!,11935,1
11935,The gloves fit well and were warm but I bought them specifically to use with my phone during the winter.,11935,1
11935,I will be returning these and buying a different pair from another company.,11935,1

11937,"Watch out if/ when you unzip, te girls are flying out",11937,1
11938,Cannot use the shirt.,11938,1
11938,"It is like a small child's ""large"".",11938,1
11938,Not a women's size large.,11938,1
11939,Should have read the reviews before buying.,11939,1
11939,The neck is much bigger than the picture shows.,11939,1
11940,The metal is painted not stained and chipped with in 2 days.,11940,1
11941,I look like a nurse wearing this.,11941,1
11941,Not what I expected.,11941,1
11941,"Nothing particularly wrong with the shirt, however.",11941,1
11942,I liked the case but the zipper broke the very first time I wore it.,11942,1

11946,Would not recommend this dress to anyone,11946,1
11947,Looks beautiful different then picture and fits terribly,11947,1
11948,Blah!,11948,1
11948,"Cheaply made and so, so awkward.",11948,1
11948,I wish I had the proper words to describe.,11948,1
11948,"I purchased a size small and it fit, but seemed to be pulling in all the wrong places as if it were incorrectly cut?",11948,1
11948,Just.... no.,11948,1
11949,I was excited to receive these but they were a disappointment because of the cloudiness of the stones.,11949,1
11950,"Broke the first time my granddaughter wore it...she's twelve years old, knows how to take care of jewelry...it just broke.",11950,1
11951,IT DID NOT WORK,11951,1

11954,"Bought a 2x, two sizes bigger than I am for safety sake, STILL about a size too small.",11954,1
11954,Not just in the waist but in the legs.,11954,1
11954,"I feel like allowance for size, in respect to plus sized items, there must be a thought that our legs aren't stick thin and waists/hips aren't the only thing large in width.",11954,1
11954,I'm very disappointed with my purchase and warn you lovely ladies that the fit is small and cuts off circulation to your ankles if you manage to tolerate the squeeze.,11954,1
11954,"Best of luck, dears.",11954,1
11955,Baggy up too tight in the waist -medium 5ft 9in 140lb,11955,1
11956,Cheap.,11956,1
11957,This product didn't even work and waste of my money on this.,11957,1
11957,Talked to a cell retailer and they said they don't have any that works for that phone,11957,1
11958,"Way too large and after the first wash, it was awful.",11958,1
11958,Faded and material became scratchy and piled up.,11958,1
11959,Wrong everything with,11959,1
11960,"ABSOLUTELY HUGE, cost as much to ship it back as to buy it.",11960,1
11961,Looks like it can be a nice bracelet most suitable for a young girl.,11961,1

11972,My granddaughters will wear it when they spend the night.,11972,1
11973,"was beautiful but bottom to small top ok size , i was extremely disappointed because the bottom had a rip in the butt area , also top felt perfect when i first put it on but after i got in the water it started to stretch and become loose , my boob kept slipping out even with the strap being adjusted but as soon as i dried off it'd go back to being the perfect size and no longer felt loose which was very strange .",11973,1
11973,had to wear spandex shorts instead of the bottoms which was another disappointment .,11973,1
11973,Do not recommend buying this product..,11973,1
11974,"The waist ends at my hips, like lo - rise jeans.",11974,1

11976,I'm a 32 to 34 DD to DDD.,11976,1
11976,"Luckily I can still wear it because my boobs do not sag at all, but even with mine this bra can't seem to stay where it should and offers zero support.",11976,1
11976,I would recommend only buying this is you are a B cup or less.,11976,1
11976,"There are better brands for bigger breastfed women on amazon, as this is only one of many I bought on here and this is the least supportive and largest out of all of them.",11976,1
11977,"To echo the other reviews- cheap material, and ridiculously sized.",11977,1
11977,It's like it was made for a baby doll.,11977,1
11978,I don't even think these sunglasses are worth one star.,11978,1
11978,"I bought my first pair on June 2, 2016,  within a week they broke!",11978,1

11978,These sunglasses have broken three times.,11978,1

11985,This dress is not how you see in the picture,11985,1
11986,"Don't bother getting it, the fabric is so elastic it's almost as if you are wearing a bathing suite.. Way to small and is not flattering, order a size up!",11986,1

11987,"Bad quality, bad design, simply not happy and did not get a full refund.",11987,1
11987,"Some may like it I guess, as for it is on here and sells, but not what we were expecting and certainly would not recommend.",11987,1

11998,Will be sending it back.,11998,1
11998,"Not sue if that is factory defect, but don't want to try again to find out.",11998,1
11999,"I like the concept of this ring, but it is made very cheaply and the spinner portion does not spin freely.",11999,1
11999,It tends to get caught up on itself and I end up having to reshape it frequently.,11999,1
11999,I find it annoying rather than soothing.,11999,1
11999,I would not recommend this particular ring.,11999,1

12034,It's huge and ugly and looks like a dress my grandmother would wear.,12034,1
12035,"After reading the reviews, I ordered my dress a size larger than usual.",12035,1
12035,I normally wear a Medium therefore I ordered a large.,12035,1
12035,It is made of very cheap material and it is so big that it looks like I am wearing a potatoe sack.,12035,1
12036,I purchased these glasses more as an experiment to see if they had the same dimensions of the Oakley Holbrook.,12036,1
12036,This would allow me to use many of my replacement lenses in the same frames as my Oakley's.,12036,1
12036,The good news is they are the same dimensions and my replacement lenses work perfectly and offers an additional dimension to my lens / frame combinations for social and business use.,12036,1
12036,The down side is I found the design to be not as wide at the ears as the equivalent Oakley's and this caused me some pressure above my ears and that lead to a headache every time 8 wore them.,12036,1
12036,As a stand alone review without the influence of a pair of Oakley's these are ok but the narrowness continue to challenge longer term wearability.,12036,1
12036,This could also be as these are designed for a market where a narrower head dimension is more common,12036,1
12037,Terrible quality,12037,1
12038,This product does not look like in the images.,12038,1
12038,It is strangely over large in the back.,12038,1

12044,"The fit was a bit small and the color was way off from this image posted but the major problem that I couldn't live with was that the fabric was so cheap looking and thin, it looked more like a Halloween costume than a skirt appropriate for work.",12044,1
12045,In the pictures it looks like it would fit lomg torso but it looks regular length to me.,12045,1
12045,Not happy at all.,12045,1

12053,(I am a size 8)...I already washed them otherwise I would give them back...,12053,1
12054,This is a beautiful bag but I have only had the bag a month and the stitching is coming apart on the inside.,12054,1
12054,It is literally coming undone along the zipper.,12054,1
12054,This was an expensive bag.,12054,1

12144,It ran way smaller than expected..very disappointed,12144,1
12145,"very cheap, and wasn't as big as I thought",12145,1
12146,"If you want a hat that you chase all over the place, this is the hat for you.",12146,1
12146,The slightest puff of wind blows it off my head.,12146,1
12146,"It was delivered on time, packaged appropriately, but this hat is absolute junk, a total waste of money purchasing it, and also a total waste of energy having it delivered.",12146,1
12146,It is leaving a trail of portions of fragile hat straw everywhere it goes and there are already a couple of places on the brim that have fractured enough for me to put two or three fingers through.,12146,1
12146,The straw is incredibly brittle.,12146,1
12146,"The vinyl padding that is in the inside of the front brim is useless, it should have some ability to soak in some sweat, but it just flops down and needs to be pushed up repeatedly.",12146,1
12146,And don't even get me started on the chinstrap.,12146,1
12146,It's about as useful as a cat-flap on a surfboard.,12146,1
12146,The adjuster has no friction so you can't lock it under your chin without a knot in it.,12146,1
12146,I've finally put a second strap on it to go around the back of my head to stop it blowing away every time I step off my tractor.,12146,1
12146,It won't be very long before it is tossed into the incinerator.,12146,1
12147,XL is what I asked for.,12147,1
12147,"Does not fit, it seams  to be for a very small men.",12147,1
12147,It took to long to arrive.,12147,1
12148,Ordered 3x size.,12148,1
12148,"I am 5'10, 220 lbs and usually 44R.",12148,1
12148,Could barely put my arm into one sleeve.,12148,1
12148,"My daughter is a size zero  5'7"" 110 lbs and she almost can't wear this.",12148,1
12148,ridiculously small.,12148,1
12148,"don't even try to order
(also took 4 weeks to arrive)",12148,1
12149,I ordered a small and it fit like a large,12149,1

12155,He's so amazing but I'm sad that the wrong size was sent!,12155,1
12155,"Other than that, the sweatshirt is good quality and looks warm.",12155,1
12156,This dress is HIDEOUS!,12156,1
12156,Don't let the pictures fool you.,12156,1
12156,The fabruc is uncomfortable and the bra cups are BRIGHT WHITE and stand out.,12156,1
12156,It looks nothing like the picture.,12156,1
12156,DO NOT BUY THIS!,12156,1
12156,The material is a darker blue than what's pictured.,12156,1
12156,Unless you want to send it back to China you won't get your full refund.,12156,1
12156,Highly disappointed.,12156,1
12157,Loved the fit of these leggings but unfortunately they arrived with a hole in the crotch area.,12157,1
12157,I may possibly stitch these up but it's clear that considering the quality of these leggings the rips will only happen again.,12157,1
12157,"Very sad, as the cut of these was exactly what I have been looking for.",12157,1
12157,I would love to work with the seller if possible to see if we can fix this issue because I really do love the fit of these leggings!,12157,1

12158,Just a waste of money.,12158,1
12159,Thin didn't hold water off for very long,12159,1
12160,You would be wise to order 2-3 sizes larger.,12160,1
12160,I take a size 10 and an xl was too small.,12160,1
12160,Wouldn't return.,12160,1
12160,Gave me percent off purchase now I have to give it to good will.,12160,1
12161,The dress is as short as a shirt would be.,12161,1
12161,Top fit but the dress literally did not cover my rear end.,12161,1
12162,Runs large.. boxy like one other person said.. fringes break off easily,12162,1

12168,Material was good for the price of the robe.,12168,1
12168,Not true to size.,12168,1
12168,At least 2 sizes too large.,12168,1
12169,I'll rate this ONE star because it lasted me ONE day.,12169,1
12169,Literally.,12169,1
12169,It broke when I was putting it on to wear for the second time.,12169,1

12172,What a waste of money.,12172,1
12173,The dress I received was definitely not the dress pictured.,12173,1
12173,It was a very cheap knockoff of it.,12173,1
12173,"Compare some of the user-submitted pictures to the stock photo and you'll see the flowers are not int he same place, and it has a lot less embroidery than pictured.",12173,1
12173,It was so cheap there was not even a tag.,12173,1

12191,I was expecting cotton and got poor quality fabric.,12191,1
12191,Second I ordered the smallest size they had and it says it runs small so if anything I thought it would end up to small but it was way to large and very long in the front.,12191,1
12191,Lastly I wanted to return it abe can't because they want me to pay more then what I paid for the shirt to send it back.,12191,1

12213,"So,  once I realized that,  I had to slightly re stretch.",12213,1

12213,"Plus,  the flare and length was too big for my ears.",12213,1
12213,The colors also aren't as vibrant.,12213,1

12246,This material is awful..,12246,1
12247,I love the print however the item came in sewn horrible.,12247,1
12247,The quality of the fabric is decent for the price however I can't wear them since they are sewn defective.,12247,1
12247,Too bad.,12247,1
12247,I really like the print :(,12247,1
12248,Not happy with purchase,12248,1
12249,Very cheap and way too large,12249,1
12250,The color - I ordered the Army Green and what I got was some shiny cheap almost lime green with a dark ugly satin lining that stands out like a sore thumb.,12250,1
12250,"The size - I'm normally an 8/10 or Med/Lg, knowing that Asian sizes run small I ordered the XXL.",12250,1
12250,The bottom layer which you can see is supposed to be open but should be enough to close over your chest and is about 4 inches from that point.,12250,1
12250,I'm a 36C.,12250,1
12250,"The cut - From the photo it shows the top layer ""cloak"" should overlap and cover your shoulders giving a flowy effect and expose your arms.",12250,1
12250,The one I received had the shoulders exposed as if a 3rd graders superhero cape was sewn to the back with enough material on the flaps to nearly wrap around me twice.,12250,1
12250,The quality - Sewing is good all around.,12250,1
12250,"All in all the one I got was a horrible knock off, my son laughed at it and I gave it to my neighbors daughter for her Halloween costume.",12250,1
12251,"There was no belt and it was cut very small,  doesn't fit me so waste of money.",12251,1
12252,Drew up when washed.,12252,1
12253,Cheap,12253,1
12254,Turned green,12254,1
12255,RUNS WAY TO SMALL.,12255,1
12255,YOU HAVE TO GET 3 SIZES BIGGER THAN YOU ACTUALLY WEAR.,12255,1
12256,material does not strech,12256,1
12257,"While the design is cute, the neck hole was massive compared to the rest of the romper.",12257,1
12257,It kept falling off my son's shoulders.,12257,1
12257,"After only wearing it for the second time, one of the snaps broke.",12257,1
12257,We decided it was time to toss it.,12257,1
12257,Don't waste your money on this ill-fitting cheaply made romper.,12257,1
12258,This dress is wayyyy longer than described in the reviews.,12258,1
12258,"I'm 5'1, so I expected it to be a little long, but this thing is super long.",12258,1
12258,"If I loved it, I would get it taken up, but there are issues all around with this dress.",12258,1
12258,"I guess since I'm short, the open part that comes down the sides is way too low.",12258,1
12258,The back more so just covers my butt crack and that's not cute.,12258,1
12258,I ordered a small and it's big everywhere.,12258,1
12258,"The top is loose, everything is loose...and the material is spandex or nylon or something.",12258,1
12258,"I don't know because there's no tag, but it's super stretchy and shiny like work out clothes.",12258,1
12258,"I thought it would be a soft cotton, but nah.",12258,1
12258,Not a fan of this dress.,12258,1
12259,Ordered a XXL-it wouldn't fit my 10 year old son and he's a small frame.,12259,1
12259,Shipping took 3-4 weeks.,12259,1
12260,"I ordered two sizes bigger than I usually wear, and it was still super tiny.",12260,1
12260,"Looks nothing like the style in the picture, more like it could be a tight fitted crop top for working at sea world.",12260,1
12260,Because it ships from China returning this product costs more than the item.,12260,1
12261,I ordered an XL and I'm sure this might fit a small child...,12261,1
12261,Ridiculous!,12261,1
12262,"It showed that you get two of them but it's not true ,They just send one .It doesn't fit well",12262,1
12263,They are not cuffs.,12263,1
12263,They are earings.,12263,1
12263,And they are symmetrical,12263,1
12264,Small and cheap,12264,1
12265,very cheaply made and both pair were broken when they arrived.,12265,1
12265,not very happy!,12265,1
12266,The sewing was awful it looks like a knock off .,12266,1
12266,I do not recommend at all.,12266,1
12267,Returning soon.,12267,1
12267,The worst quality ever and the color doesn't match the picture,12267,1
12268,The charm itself is as pictured.,12268,1
12268,"However, it did not come with the clasp opener, nor the pictured Pandora pouch.",12268,1
12268,These are small secondary items but I still feel duped.,12268,1
12268,"The charm itself is good, but buy from another vendor.",12268,1
12269,Just received these and they are awful.,12269,1
12269,"They are stuff, see through when you bend over and slightly itchy.",12269,1
12269,Will not be wearing these.,12269,1
12270,I've tried everything and they won't budge.,12270,1
12271,I completely agree with the comment of the material being made out of a matter cover pad!!,12271,1
12271,I am not kidding you.,12271,1
12271,this is not knitted at all.,12271,1
12271,I am extremely dissappointed with this dress.,12271,1
12271,Does not fall well like in the pictures either and the sleeves are not long enough.,12271,1
12271,I asked for a refund and the seller said they would refund 4$ only as shipping back to China would be costly.,12271,1
12271,"Even though this is not that expensive, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this.",12271,1
12272,"This product is not red, white and blue.",12272,1
12272,"It is red, white and BLACK!!!!",12272,1
12272,"The cut is also not the same as the Ujena product it appears to be based on, although it seems to be using the Ujena picture!!!!",12272,1
12272,Do NOT buy if looking for a USA flag inspired swimsuit.,12272,1
12273,The Velcro came loose from the stitching.,12273,1
12273,Not good quality.,12273,1
12274,I did not like this at all.,12274,1
12274,Really flimsy.,12274,1
12274,Came with holes in the sleeve.,12274,1
12274,XL fits like a med.,12274,1
12274,Returning asap.,12274,1
12275,Cute but about 2 size smaller when I got it in .,12275,1
12275,It is made small .,12275,1
12276,"Got it in the mail today, went to put it on..and the clasp broke.",12276,1
12276,Wouldn't recommend it to anyone planning on wearing it.,12276,1
12277,This product broke the 2nd day I had it in; the barbell detached from the back of the sun where it was supposed to be glued or soldered together.,12277,1
12278,Very casual with cheap fabric.,12278,1
12278,Does not lay well.,12278,1
12278,Not at all luxurious like the picture.,12278,1
12279,Sizes run very small barely fit my ten year old  size medium,12279,1
12280,This dress is a joke!,12280,1
12281,This top does not fit like my other Piko shirts.,12281,1
12281,It was much smaller and the color looks completely different in person.,12281,1
12282,"Did not fit, they did not have the larger size sending them back",12282,1
12283,"For some reason, these tanks appeared under an amazon ""maternity tank tops"" search along with maternity listings.",12283,1
12283,"Even if I hadn't needed them to fit a pregnant belly, I'd still give them one star.",12283,1
12283,That's because they're very cheaply and inconsistently made.,12283,1
12283,"The white one actually fit my 8-month pregnant tummy, while the grey one was super short and oddly cut.",12283,1
12283,Aren't these supposed to be the same tank?,12283,1
12283,I don't recommend these.,12283,1
12284,"It is not properly constructed, the pattern is off because of how it is cut, the sides do not offer much coverage and it makes it appear as though my B cups are about to pop out of it - it does not look like the picture.",12284,1
12284,The pattern is the same but the colour is not is as vibrant - a waste of money.,12284,1
12284,"The bottoms fit ok though, sad that I only needed the top.",12284,1
12285,Cheap made,12285,1
12286,The zipper broke after only a few weeks of light use.,12286,1
12286,Disappointing purchase.,12286,1
12287,To small.,12287,1
12287,Din't like material,12287,1
12288,"The tights fit as expected - good quality, however, the one star is due to the misinformation.",12288,1
12288,Selling as a 2 pack (and the packaging clearly states that as well) but only one pair of tights was included.,12288,1
12288,"If a second pair is sent, I will adjust the rating.",12288,1
12289,Order two sizes larger than what you would normally wear.,12289,1
12290,"Nice color, however the fabric was poor quality and the cut is not for larger breasts.",12290,1
12291,Order a smaller size it runs really big.....material is thin and see through.....it came on time......i returned for refund just wasn't what i thought it was based off description and photo,12291,1

12295,"I only wear them once a day, when taking a walk in the morning.",12295,1
12295,The frames always break.,12295,1
12295,"Today, the top frame just snapped while I was wearing them!",12295,1
12295,"The lenses are great, but the frames are worthless and therefore render these glasses worthless.",12295,1
12296,DOES NOT FIT A 38 DD,12296,1
12297,This dress looks nothing like it does on line.,12297,1

12303,Small,12303,1
12304,Definitely is pink.,12304,1
12304,I was thinking it would be red based on description and pictures.,12304,1
12304,It's also quite a plastic texture.,12304,1
12305,The size was too small,12305,1
12306,"The material feels plastic-like and costumey -- I assumed from the picture that this was a mostly cotton dress, but it feels like 100% polyester.",12306,1
12306,"Because the material is plastic-like, the dress doesn't flow and hangs stiffly.",12306,1
12307,Too Short in the fit was off,12307,1
12308,"I ordered an XL, way to small.",12308,1

12312,I wish the sizing was correct.,12312,1
12312,I wouldn't recommend anyone that wears a 2x or larger to order this.,12312,1
12312,"If you wear a 1x, you should order the 5x.",12312,1
12313,sizing is off and not good quality.,12313,1
12314,This nightgown is supposed to allow you easy access to your breasts for nursing.,12314,1

12334,I'm little.,12334,1

12347,"The concept was so appealing...upcycled from milatary canvas, the styles were cute, even though mine was returned for size (my fault).",12347,1
12347,The smell was horrific and the canvas was outsourced for production.,12347,1
12347,The canvas had to be sent to another country to be manufactured?,12347,1
12347,"In my mind, that defeated the purpose of using our military canvas.",12347,1
12348,Very cheaply made and couldn't return the item due to all the restrictions this company had on returns.,12348,1

12353,"They were marked size 13, but definitely ran WAY TOO SMALL.",12353,1
12353,I hated these shorts and ended up giving them to good will instead of returning them so someone else can get use out of them.,12353,1
12353,"I was extremely bummed out because I loved these shorts online and was so excited to receive them, but no thanks.",12353,1
12353,I will stay away from these.,12353,1

12358,I ordered this based on the size chart provided and it's at least a size too small.,12358,1

12385,The stitching is jagged around the foot hole.,12385,1
12385,"Instead of sewing the foot hole to the sock, they took a strip of cloth and crossed the it on top in a mismatched circle.",12385,1
12385,The stitching is sloppily crossed on top of each other.,12385,1
12385,The purple sock doesn't even have thread that is purple.,12385,1
12385,"Additionally, my yellow sock has a stain on it (circled in picture).",12385,1
12385,"I was going to give these as a gift but I am to embarrassed, as they look like they came from a dollar store.",12385,1
12385,When you pay $12 for 5 pairs of socks you expect to get nice socks.,12385,1
12385,Carters or Gerber socks can be purchased in 6 packs for less and are cute and made correctly.,12385,1
12385,I don't know how all these reviews say they are so wonderful.,12385,1

12423,But the overall look of the bag looked cheap.,12423,1
12423,"Here in the pictures it doesn't, looks super cute here.",12423,1
12423,I just wasn't very satisfied all together.,12423,1

12425,Sending back.,12425,1
12426,"poor quality, too big, looks really bad.",12426,1
12427,I loved the fit and style so much that I actually ordered two in different sizes.,12427,1
12427,I did what the instruction told us to - soak the suit with salt and water before use to prevent color fading and hand wash only but they both faded badly.,12427,1
12427,The newest one which Royal Blue faded even after less than 5 washes.,12427,1
12427,The underwire keeps poking out and some thread came undone after  few washes too.,12427,1
12427,"However, these are less annoying to me than the fading.",12427,1
12427,In the first picture the straps of the Royal Blue have the original color which is vibrant.,12427,1
12427,The second picture shows lines of discoloration in the belly area.,12427,1

12428,I had such high hopes for it.,12428,1
12428,The only nice about it was the box it came.,12428,1

12433,I carry my wallet in & out of the stores; an occasional wiping with damp cloth and most look good for a year or more.,12433,1
12433,This is going to look bad in just a couple of months.,12433,1
12433,It doesn't clean.,12433,1
12433,"I guess if you are a foo-foo kind of person and rarely take it out of your purse, it would be fine.",12433,1
12433,"Otherwise, I am extremely disappointed.",12433,1

12458,I was finally sent another mask.,12458,1
12458,The mask doesn't fit on my face.,12458,1
12458,It doesn't even lie flat.,12458,1
12458,This needs to be labeled as a toy or childrens' mask.,12458,1

12458,The band is different from the photo.,12458,1

12462,I used the measurement chart and actually ordered abigger size than it said thinking that would be a safe bet.,12462,1
12462,I was wrong.,12462,1
12462,I swear it was meant for doll,12462,1

12466,returned it cheap,12466,1
12467,I ordered an xxl because I wanted a baggy shirt well first off it took over two weeks to arrive and the graphic on the tee sucks it's light and faded you can barely see it and the size is unacceptable it fits like a medium.,12467,1
12467,Do not waste your money or time!,12467,1
12468,Uncomfortable,12468,1

12469,The issue I had was with the smell.,12469,1
12469,Right out of the package was an oppressive chemical smell that was unbelievably strong.,12469,1
12469,I washed them alone (in cold) and the smell stayed and the color faded.,12469,1
12469,Whatever ink is being used to dye these leggings is not anything I'd want on my skin!,12469,1
12469,Into the trash they went.,12469,1
12470,The dress is completely sheer.,12470,1
12470,You can see everything underneath the dress.,12470,1
12470,It is cheaply made and a complete waste of money.,12470,1
12470,Don't do it unless you want to wear it as a night gown.,12470,1
12471,Very small.,12471,1

12654,It stretches and doesn't give the illusion of a wait line.,12654,1
12654,It shrinks and rides up so you have to keep pulling it down or pulling it up.,12654,1

12661,Changes color in less than 10 days and it is not cleanable using silver cleaner.,12661,1
12661,This means it is not .925 sterling silver.,12661,1
12661,It looks like light silver plating on a mental chain.,12661,1
12661,The color change is permanent.,12661,1
12661,Can't use this chain any more.,12661,1
12662,The mustache doesn't lay flat against face.,12662,1

12671,"I'm 5'6"" and it hit me mid-calf.",12671,1
12671,It's awful.,12671,1
12671,I'm donating it to my school's drama department.,12671,1
12671,Maybe it will fit a middle schooler.,12671,1
12671,It most certainly is not meant to be worn by anyone over 5 feet.,12671,1
12672,... And the bamboo fell off the piercing base..,12672,1

12687,Couldn't ship it back for obvious reasons.,12687,1
12687,A complete blow-out!!!,12687,1
12687,The only reason I gave it one star is cuz I still loved the style and look of the garment.,12687,1
12688,No two of the balls were broke but i couldn't send them back because i need them for work,12688,1
12689,"Garbage, the cord is loose and the ends are frayed and not knotted.",12689,1

12698,"It can't open beyond 3/16"" at the tip of the unit.",12698,1
12698,That is not enough to stretch a shoe and clearly is not what is pictured on the product page.,12698,1
12698,I don't know about other people's experience but that is mine.,12698,1
12698,It just doesn't work for mechanical reasons.,12698,1
12698,The fact that the mechanism is defective in this way shows that the company has poor quality control since all they had to do it try to open it themselves before shipping it.,12698,1
12698,They would have found that it doesn't work.,12698,1
12698,Probably has a stripped threaded rod or something like that to cause it to click out of the thread and fall back.,12698,1
12698,I can't recommend this product.,12698,1
12699,I don't think this is real polo.,12699,1

12732,"I ordered a 4x, going up 2-3 sizes as the other reviews had suggested.",12732,1
12732,"It only fit about half of my chest in the cups: the cups on the 4x may be a size C cup, small D cup at best.",12732,1

12751,!,12751,1
12752,"the real product doesn't show like in the picture, don't buy",12752,1
12753,The listing claimed that this bathrobe is 100% cotton.,12753,1
12753,"IT IS NOT COTTON,  IT IS POLYESTER.",12753,1
12754,This item fit is for little teenage girls material is small bought the largest size and now way it fit.,12754,1
12754,I handed it to my daughter who had to give it to her friend who weighs 100lbs and it was a large,12754,1
12755,I am so disappointed.,12755,1
12755,"I was really looking forward to this dress and eveb paid extra,  for 1 day shipping.",12755,1
12755,Maybe that was my undoing because it looks like the dress was sown in a rush because some of the stiches are coming off and the zipper is very bad.,12755,1
12755,Keeps sticking right out of the bag the first time i tried it on.,12755,1
12756,I ordered a medium and it fit like an extra small/petite.,12756,1
12756,I also discovered that the little belt holders on both sides were not lined up with each other with one sewn on higher than the other.,12756,1
12756,It was very obvious that left side holds the belt higher that the right.,12756,1
12756,This coat is poorly made and it's as if quality control forgot to come to work the day these were being made.,12756,1
12756,I wanted to returned this product but the small insert inside was in Chinese....typical.,12756,1
12757,great shirt for winter,12757,1

12762,The fabric and color doesn't look like the picture.,12762,1
12763,"The color of this is not pink, it's more of a peach.",12763,1
12763,It fits smaller than expected and shrinks in wash.,12763,1
12764,I bought it for my Louis Vuitton Neverful MM.,12764,1
12764,It's ugly.,12764,1
12764,But does it's job of organizing the bag.,12764,1
12764,It not pretty to look at.,12764,1
12764,I tried to exchange it for a pink one but seller tells me I have to pay for shipping.,12764,1
12764,"But it says in the website, free returns!",12764,1
12764,I just bought the samorga organizer instead (a pink one!),12764,1
12764,which costs more but worth it.,12764,1
12765,"Although these cufflinks look amazing sitting in my jewelry box or laying on my nightstand, I hate wearing them because they twist and the letter ends up twisting 90 degrees every time causing letter to not appear straight (see attached pictures).",12765,1
12765,The letter should show in the correct position with your arms straight down.,12765,1
12765,Very simple solution for a product that would otherwise receive a 5 star rating.,12765,1
12765,Pros - Size is great and makes them really stand out.,12765,1
12765,Chrome is really shiny and makes them pop.,12765,1
12765,MAJOR Con - Cufflink post is welded incorrectly and causes the letter to twist.,12765,1
12765,"It also shifts because the toggle pushes up against inside of the sleeve causing it to twist, as well.",12765,1
12766,The sizing is so wrong..,12766,1
12766,I got a large and it fits my 4 year old not me,12766,1
12767,This dress does not look at all like the picture.,12767,1
12767,"Is absolutely bad quality, see through.",12767,1
12767,It feels like wearing lingerie.,12767,1
12767,I am sending it back!,12767,1
12768,Was not as long as it looks in picture,12768,1
12769,Quality was terrible.,12769,1

12772,"Potential for cute, I will redesign it to fit.",12772,1
12773,I bought this thinking that it would be a high quality belt but I was so disappointed.,12773,1
12773,It felt like plastic and when compared to another leather belt that I had it just seemed fake.,12773,1
12773,I have so much regret for buying this belt and just think that it was a rip off regardless of the sale price that it was bought under.,12773,1
12773,I would have preferred to  pay the full price for a high quality 100% leather belt.,12773,1
12774,My husband ordered this for himself.,12774,1
12774,It was too small.,12774,1
12775,When I got this product I didn't even wear it because it runs big and I'm usually a size 3 and I have a 24 inch waist and I ordered a small and it was so big in the hips area and waist.,12775,1
12776,"I gave this as a gift to my friend and after a few days in her possession, it broke.",12776,1
12776,"She went on a walk with her boyfriend and when she looked, it was gone.",12776,1
12776,They retraced their steps to try to find it but was unable to.,12776,1
12777,"this shirt is sized for a child, not an adult, there are 2 snag holes in this cheap top",12777,1
12778,They work well for holding cards as long as you don't mind carrying around a cheap piece of felt in your bag.,12778,1
12778,They collect lint very quickly and are definitely a cheap product - buy something that costs even $5 more and you won't regret it.,12778,1
12779,Item was entirely too small and had a bad odor.,12779,1
12780,way way too small,12780,1

12783,Now that I know its too late to send it back.,12783,1
12783,very disappointed in the product and service.......,12783,1

12791,If you like Mumus then this is for you!,12791,1
12791,The rounded neck with the string tie gives it a cheap look and looks more like a top some grannys would wear as a house top.,12791,1
12792,Really lacked in quality and looks nothing like in the picture,12792,1
12793,The bar is to thin & mu hole started to get smaller I just put my org ones back in would be great if the bar could get made thicker,12793,1

12846,I checked the size chart and ordered a Large which was listed as a 12/14.,12846,1

13049,Way way too small I bought a large I'm a size 6 I looked at the measurements online and even bought a size up that I thought I would meet just in case and it barely fit I could get it zaps but only around the smallest part of my waist which meant that I hung just above my ass.,13049,1
13049,Not to mention the fact that the fabric ripped almost immediately when I was putting it on,13049,1
13050,"Nasty accrillic yarn, oddly fitting and misshapen.",13050,1

13077,"When it arrived it was for the Samsung Galaxy S5 mini, not the full size, thereby doing me no good.",13077,1

13079,I thought I could put two larger bracelets with one set of smaller bracelets.,13079,1

13085,I like the concept of this swimsuit after having children my stomach isn't what it used to be.,13085,1

13172,was made too small.,13172,1

13182,Literally ranging from a Medium- XXL I tried them all.,13182,1
13182,They all were almost exactly the same.,13182,1
13182,"The material had no stretch to it, and the torso was built for a person 1 foot tall.",13182,1
13182,Literally maybe a 6 inch piece of material between the bottom cover and the bra part.,13182,1

13187,"She normally wears a 7/8 and even after reading the reviews saying it ran big, I still thought a 6 would be too small so I got an 8.",13187,1
13187,IT IS  ENORMOUS on her!,13187,1
13187,It was more like a size 12 or 14!,13187,1

13188,"After 3 months the watch started falling apart, I honestly feel like I've been scammed.",13188,1

13196,I normal order clothing in that size and this item was not for plus size.,13196,1
13196,In the picture it looks long and in actuality it is very short.,13196,1

13196,Complete was of money.,13196,1
13197,Smaller than expected.,13197,1

13204,They flat out said it in our correspondence.,13204,1
13205,"This product despite being a piece for costume, was very cheap and flimsy.",13205,1

13208,"I bought an extra large just in case (even though I'm usually an adult medium), and even then it is pure s***.",13208,1
13208,"For one, it's spandex, not cotton.",13208,1
13208,"Two, it should be considered a child's small.",13208,1
13208,"And three, I ordered black, it's definitely navy blue and see-through because it's so tight.",13208,1
13209,"looks great in the picture but its horrible, cheap made waste of my money.",13209,1

13216,Not true to size,13216,1
13217,"I purchased the open buckle made to look like a regular belt, and found out the ugly way that this is not 100% leather.",13217,1
13217,"The piece on the buckle that protrudes to make it look like a normal belt ends up rubbing against the ""leather"" and leaves raised creases behind.",13217,1
13217,Looks and feels more like pleather.,13217,1
13217,"I probably should have noticed earlier, when I cut the belt to size and the inside looked like it was made of layers that didn't really look like leather, but I didn't inspect it further.",13217,1
13217,"I'll add a picture when I get a chance, and will possibly dice up this belt once I get a new belt.",13217,1

13234,The fit is more Victorian than Edwardian.,13234,1
13235,Sunglasses look cute from a far but these are super cheap.,13235,1
13235,I was looking for cheapo fashion sunglasses so I wasn't excepting much honestly but these are too cheap and bad quality for me to wear around in the city....,13235,1
13235,It might be hard to see in my photos but you can see every break on the pieces coming together and the gold looks so cheap in person.,13235,1
13235,Like it would cheap off after a couple of wears.,13235,1
13235,The arms of the sunglasses were very hard to open (might just be the pair I got but still).,13235,1
13235,"If you're looking to buy, I would find other cheapo sunglasses before buying these!",13235,1
13236,Their actually a really nice pair of sunglasses.,13236,1

13250,"The material was cheap, and not what I expected from Alpinestar.",13250,1
13250,We own a lot of motocross brands and this is by far the worst purchase ever made.,13250,1
13250,The hoodie shrunk at least 3 times smaller then the size purchased.,13250,1

13269,It was way too big for my wrist.,13269,1
13269,Plus the hair tie kept slipping off of the bracelet so I would just end up with a hair tie and ugly bracelet both around my wrist.,13269,1
13270,"Same as before the dress, to large, but only on one side!!?",13270,1
13270,"?, Missing some pearls and some of them rather hastily and on wrong place sawed.",13270,1

13276,If there was a thing like no star I honestly would go for it.,13276,1

13277,I am a 34D and got a small.,13277,1

13521,Suppose to be size 7 but it was like an 8.,13521,1
13522,"Fabric was torn on arrival, and it feels like 100% nylon -- no stretch, no cotton feel.",13522,1
13522,It's also so small that even an XL was too small for my skinny sister!,13522,1
13523,Not for me!,13523,1
13523,"Had to send back, really not flattering and just looked flimsy.",13523,1
13524,I should have trusted the bad reviews.,13524,1
13524,I had to return this bag.,13524,1
13524,"The zipper does not run the entire inner length of the bag, so even when it is zipped closed there are still huge gaping opening on either end.",13524,1
13524,"The top handles are not canvas, but a weird fake leather that smells odd and looks terrible.",13524,1
13524,"All of the metal hardware on the bag (clasps, buckles, clips, etc.)",13524,1
13524,is VERY flimsy and these are exactly the locations of the bag that need to be durable to keep handles attached while using and I've already covered the bit about how the bag is impossible to close completely.,13524,1
13524,These complaints are the reason that I couldn't even risk putting personal items in this bag and try it out.,13524,1
13524,It was returned immediately.,13524,1
13525,Crappy,13525,1
13526,"I returned them because they were to big, I like roomy PJ's but there's were really big I ordered a large.",13526,1
13526,I wear a size 8 pants,13526,1

13527,They were a disappointment.,13527,1
13528,NOT plus size.,13528,1
13528,Returning.,13528,1
13528,Whoever thought this was plus size is crazy.,13528,1
13528,The sleeve wouldn't pass my forearm and I wear an 18/20.,13528,1
13528,"While pretty, sadly misadvertised.",13528,1

13543,And the material is see through,13543,1
13544,"The sleeves are too tight, the length is too short, and the fabric is ridiculously THIN.",13544,1
13544,"I ordered black and when I hold it up to the light, I can see through it as easy as a screen window.",13544,1
13544,I had high hopes for this.,13544,1
13544,It arrived quickly and it is soft.,13544,1
13544,BUT...,13544,1
13544,"I normally wear a medium, in this case I ordered a large to be safe.",13544,1
13544,But even a large is smaller than the medium shirts I buy in the store.,13544,1
13544,And it's far too thin to keep me warm.,13544,1
13544,I wasted my money on this.,13544,1
13545,Way to small.,13545,1
13545,Cheap material.,13545,1

13551,I ordered a small and usually am about a 4.,13551,1
13551,This romper was so huge it is unwearable.,13551,1
13551,"I'm not being dramatic, it is meant to be worn blousy- this is bigger than putting on a pillow case.",13551,1
13552,It's a cheap ass made in China piece of crap n,13552,1
13553,It's not really what I thought it would be honestly.,13553,1
13553,The material is really thin and you are able to see through it.,13553,1
13553,Its really rather cheap looking in my opinion.,13553,1
13553,I ordered this to wear in Mexico so I think there it will work just fine but I won't wear it again after that.,13553,1
13553,"It does stretch and the fit is ok I ordered a large because I'm 5'3 and about 160lbs I carry most of this weight in my lower body to thick thighs, butt, hips and the skirt fit pretty good.",13553,1
13553,I'm not 100% happy with this and I'm not sure I would recommend anyone to order it.,13553,1
13554,Not at all what I expected and now I can not return it.,13554,1
13554,Did not arrive on time.,13554,1

13555,Beyond small.,13555,1
13555,"Ordered a large, it fit like a bathing suit.",13555,1

13555,"But I'm pretty sure that's how they make their money, because this product was beyond awful.",13555,1
13556,The material is see through & very cheaply made.,13556,1
13556,Most likely won't even wear it.,13556,1
13557,That $20 shirt is worth four bucks,13557,1
13558,"Shirt was described as Women's fit, wider & longer.",13558,1
13558,"I believe I received the Junior fit shirt in error or both Women's & Juniors fit the same way, Very small.",13558,1
13558,Returning all 5 shirts I purchased,13558,1
13559,This dress is very different from the picture.,13559,1
13559,"It runs extremely small, is tight fitting, not loose like the photo, and is actually quite sheer.",13559,1
13559,Not for modest women at all.,13559,1
13560,"I got the small and the flap of material that folds over the hips is way too big, and I have big hips.",13560,1
13560,The skirt would not stay on properly with that loose flap.,13560,1
13561,"If you wear size s,m or l, order xl and good luck .",13561,1
13562,"Bent, didn't fit and made of cheap plastic.",13562,1
13562,Even supposedly discounted 69% to 24 dollars not worth the price.,13562,1
13562,Returned it.,13562,1
13563,I had to give one star.,13563,1
13563,This was nothing like the description.,13563,1
13563,85: not a round price of fabric it's a square plain scarf.,13563,1
13563,Disappointing.,13563,1
13564,Fell apart after only a few times wearing it!,13564,1
13564,Don't buy!,13564,1
13565,Very disappointed in the quality.,13565,1
13565,Have bought many others from (alex and ani ) and they were very different.,13565,1
13566,Hate it...too small...disappointed with everything I brought.,13566,1
13567,I bought these bracelets for my fianc&eacute; as a surprise for her.,13567,1
13567,She loved them out of the box.,13567,1
13567,But after only a day of her wearing hers it got really badly tarnished and ugly on the front where the writing was.,13567,1
13567,She was very upset.,13567,1
13567,They look amazing out of the box.,13567,1
13567,But after only lasting a day.,13567,1
13567,It was really disappointing for me to see that.,13567,1
13567,Now I'm sending them back to Amazon.,13567,1
13567,And instead putting the money I'll get back towards getting better ones made.,13567,1
13567,Which I guess I should have done in the 1st place.,13567,1
13568,I ordered my size (based on their chart) and it wasn't even CLOSE to being big enough!,13568,1
13568,Like 6 full inches away from closing!,13568,1
13568,"Additionally, this thing is absolutely NOT as long as the picture depicts.",13568,1
13568,Boo all the way around...returning.,13568,1
13569,I bought these glasses 3 months ago for a trip to the Caribbean.,13569,1
13569,The entire appeal was that they were polarized and were reflective.,13569,1
13569,they started out well enough but unfortunately they did not hold up well as after approximately 3 uses the blue reflective coating which made them appeal in the first place for use while boating etc began to flake off.,13569,1
13569,Soon it was impossible to see through the lens and i had to resort to rubbing off the coating completely just to have a pair of functional shades.,13569,1
13569,the sellers do not respond either on their website or on amazon.....,13569,1
13569,I would NOT RECOMMEND this product,13569,1

13572,"I know it's expensive and you're looking to feel better NOW, but this will hurt you.",13572,1
13572,Save up and get a good binder.,13572,1
13572,"It's not breathable and the clips are weak, and it's much too small.",13572,1
13572,-a transguy who wanted an ice cheap binder and learned his lesson,13572,1
13573,Blue die wore off in a month and is now white...,13573,1
13574,Not satisfied band lost shape and one of the small diamonds already fell out.,13574,1
13575,IF I HAD LOOKED ON THE COMPUTER TO SEE WHAT TIBETAN SILVER WAS I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THIS ITEM.,13575,1
13575,IT HAD LEAD IN THE METAL.,13575,1
13575,NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO WEAR.,13575,1
13576,Surprisingly smaller than the size indicated.,13576,1
13577,Do not buy!,13577,1
13577,As other person indicated this has incomplete stitching and looks like it will start coming undone after one wear.,13577,1
13577,Also color looks more like a butter yellow than the oatmeal.,13577,1
13578,After 1 to 2 weeks of use the side seem gave out making the garment useless.,13578,1
13578,"Otherwise, if it held up the fit was great and it worked good.",13578,1

13590,Uniform standard does not permit me to buy short sleeve.,13590,1
13590,But when is it ever cold in a kitchen?,13590,1

13597,Wayy too small,13597,1
13598,I didn't read the description well enough before I bought it.,13598,1

13605,I ended up giving these to a much smaller friend!,13605,1
13606,Horrible,13606,1
13607,I have previously ordered from the belly bandit website and it was actually a much better quality (the brown one).,13607,1
13607,When I needed to go down a size I thought it'd be cheaper to order via Amazon (the cream coloured one).,13607,1
13607,Well u get what u paid for.,13607,1
13607,This order had a different labelling and although it had all the belly bandit packaging and labels it has manufactured in China and the material had a difference in that this product creased and wasn't very durable after just wearing for half a day and didn't give much back support since the material want very durable (the brown one from the actually belly band it site lasted me 3wks without any creasing).,13607,1
13607,I tried to confront the seller for refund before the creasing but have had no luck in any replys.,13607,1
13607,Needless to say I will buy directly from belly bandit for other products.,13607,1

13619,These shorts are useless to me now.,13619,1
13620,Ok it was really inexpensive so I wasn't expecting for it to be perfect but this shirt/dress is super thin and the front and back are exactly the same so there is pretty much no definitive front!,13620,1
13620,Probably will use it as a swim suit cover,13620,1
13621,Too loose not wat i expected,13621,1

13637,Quality was fine.,13637,1
13637,"I ordered two sizes because my top and bottom are different sizes, and I heard the bottoms were very small.",13637,1
13637,To say these run small is an understatement.,13637,1
13637,"The large bottom might fit a tween, but probably would still expose a portion of buttock.",13637,1
13637,"I had read the reviews, and I went for it anyway.",13637,1
13637,"Let me reiterate what people have said before: unless you wear a double zero and don't mind posterior flesh exposure, do not buy this bikini no matter how cheap it is.",13637,1

13644,Returned immediately.,13644,1
13645,These shoes are super cute!,13645,1
13645,My 5 year old was so excited to wear them to the first day of kindergarten.,13645,1

13646,The button at the front was incredibly cheap.,13646,1
13646,The fabric felt cheap and lightweight.,13646,1
13646,This was more of a costume piece than a jacket you could comfortably wear for a night out.,13646,1
13647,It is of a bad quality and it was not the color that it seemed on the picture.,13647,1
13648,Did not fit well at all.,13648,1
13649,It looks totally different than you see on the picture And it is too big...,13649,1

13657,2 packs are so small they aren't even worth attempting to wear.,13657,1

13663,Nothing I Expected!,13663,1
13663,"Too small, Color was faded, & smelled used.",13663,1
13664,broke the first time I attempted to wear it- return was approved but I needed to pay for the return- it is internationally shipped therefore it costs more to return it then I paid for it - buyer beware the bracelet feel apart while tightening the cord to wear for the FIRST time.,13664,1

13682,I'm 5'11 and 180 pounds/ 36B w hips and I ordered a large and had to return it.,13682,1

13709,"I passed several sock stores while out of town who didn't have 100% cotton socks, and instead ordered these and paid an extra $6 to my hotel for 'handling' when I could have picked up a pair for 1.99 at the corner store.",13709,1

13747,I'm only giving it 1 star because you are required to leave a star to leave a review.,13747,1
13748,Will not be buying from this company again.,13748,1
13748,"Very cheap material, and the elbow pads are literally brown cloth cut horribly and barely stitched on.",13748,1
13748,The shirt itself is very poor quality and falling apart out of the bag.,13748,1
13749,Poor quality,13749,1
13750,Jacket was a 2x but it fit like a large,13750,1
13751,I was SO excited about this dress.,13751,1
13751,And then is FINALLY arrived and I am so disappointed.,13751,1
13751,It's embroidered... not embellished... and made from a completely different fabric than I was expecting and is too small.,13751,1
13751,"You get what you pay for, for sure.",13751,1
13751,It's too bad...,13751,1
13751,I would pay good money for the actual dress in the picture.,13751,1
13752,Product  is cheap but the seller is generous.,13752,1
13753,I ordered 3x not medium.,13753,1
13754,If I could give a 0 I would.,13754,1
13754,Got two different sized rings definitely do not recommend,13754,1
13755,They look nothing like the picture.,13755,1
13755,They are glossy print leggings instead and way too small.,13755,1
13755,I bought the informercial brand too and they fit perfect and look like jeans.,13755,1
13756,It was way to small and looked nothing like the picture.,13756,1
13756,I made sure to buy an xxl when I normally wear l/xl and it still felt like a l.,13756,1
13757,Design was smudged.,13757,1
13758,Does NOT look like picture at all!,13758,1
13758,"Very poor quality, and looks super cheap!",13758,1
13758,"Was missing a stone (the big green one) when it was delivered, and when I showed it to a friend, she said 'Is that children's dress up jewelry??",13758,1
13758,I hope you don't plan on ever wearing that.',13758,1
13758,So in the garbage it went.,13758,1
13758,Don't waste your $$$.,13758,1
13758,It is so tacky looking.,13758,1
13759,it broke the second I put it on.,13759,1
13759,one of the strings on the necklace is bigger than the other one and hangs funny.,13759,1
13759,do not buy!,13759,1
13760,On the description it said the free size would fit from small to x-large...I'm a regular medium fit and this is really small totally waste of money,13760,1
13761,Very disappointed!,13761,1
13761,I knew they were smaller.,13761,1
13761,But they showed variety.,13761,1
13761,All four of mine are the exact same color and picture.,13761,1
13761,I didn't purchase to have four of the same toy.,13761,1
13761,Boxes were crushed but the toys don't seem to be affected.,13761,1
13761,Only positive thing is they arrived 2 days before expected.,13761,1
13762,These were recently spray painted on the bottom.,13762,1
13762,Seems kinda rinky dink!,13762,1
13762,!,13762,1
13763,Cheap material,13763,1
13764,Color was not as pictured.,13764,1
13764,Not quality material.,13764,1
13764,Returned.,13764,1
13765,These were huge.,13765,1
13765,"They skipped right off my two year old's hands, after struggling to get them on.",13765,1
13765,"They are large enough to fit my adult hands, and they're average for a woman.",13765,1
13765,"There's no 'cincher' around the wrist to adjust, to help keep them on..They became such a pain I just put my gloves on my son and threw these in the truck.",13765,1
13765,Returned.,13765,1
13766,"i ordered a medium and received a ""large"" that would fit a 6 year old.and there was a big rip on the bottom of shirt.wasnt happy with it at all",13766,1
13767,Way too small,13767,1
13768,I didn't want to do it but I had to return them I have a slender/medium foot and I could literally put my foot and a hand in them.,13768,1
13768,"The top of the shoe is so high above the top of my foot that they would not stay on my feet if I tried to walk in them .You would have to be retaining a lot of fluid, have a wide foot, very high arch or very fat foot to be able to wear these.",13768,1
13768,Such a shame because they are beautiful.,13768,1
13769,Not what I was expecting.,13769,1
13769,"My Fiance hates how they feel, as they rub on her skin it is an itchy material",13769,1
13770,"I did not like it too much material  and looked like a clown skirt, I pond if off on my granddaughters for dress up and I think they didn't like it either.",13770,1
13771,BAD!,13771,1
13771,!,13771,1
13772,I ordered the foot loop version.,13772,1
13772,I've had them for two weeks and there were at least a handful of occasions where one of the clamps would snap off while I was walking despite me having secured them properly.,13772,1
13772,"To top it all off, the clasp broke off of one of the straps this morning.",13772,1
13773,I got an XL.,13773,1
13773,It was way too big.,13773,1
13773,I tried to compensate for Chinese sizing.,13773,1
13773,The shape was ugly on me.,13773,1
13773,Maybe I'll consider getting it tailored.,13773,1
13774,"As others said, it was nice the first time you wear it, but after the leggins just ride up and feels like never ending wedgies.",13774,1
13774,Think a tighter fit/smaller size would have fixed this along with a longer leg length.,13774,1
13774,But as it stands I never used this and just wear a different brand that has longer legs and stays in place.,13774,1
13775,almost to small for my 6 year old,13775,1
13776,Very cheap looking,13776,1
13777,Not as advertised at all.,13777,1
13777,The chemical smell of this sweater was awful.,13777,1
13777,It smell like gasoline  even after airing it out and washing it.,13777,1
13777,The pockets are fake and sewn on poorly.,13777,1
13777,The trim around in a large seam right in front on one side in a very obvious mistake.,13777,1
13777,The color is more of a burnt orange than tan.,13777,1
13777,I really feel that I got a cheap knock off version of the sweater in the picture.,13777,1
13777,Disappointed.,13777,1
13778,"No compression at all, these are terrible  and the shipping was extremely slow!",13778,1
13778,Not happy.,13778,1
13779,This product feels cheap.,13779,1
13779,It came with a piece of lace to lace up the back that was just barely long enough.,13779,1
13779,"It was very short and not anywhere near the length I thought it would be  I'm 5'3"" and it came above my hips still.",13779,1
13780,Don't buy fail apart horrible material,13780,1
13781,Way too small.,13781,1
13781,Ordered a large and I couldn't even fit it over my chest.,13781,1
13782,I ordered a 3XL and received a 3XL.,13782,1
13782,The garment was way too small and I could barely fit it over my bust.,13782,1
13782,(44 DD).,13782,1
13782,It was too short anyway and was unfortunately too constricting.,13782,1

13783,Item runs VERY small and short.,13783,1
13783,Would never recommend.,13783,1
13784,Sizing is very small.,13784,1
13784,I didn't like the material.,13784,1
13785,I find this item to be a waste of money.,13785,1
13785,"Not only do you have order 1-2 sizes larger than normal, but the quality doesn't hold up.",13785,1
13785,I purchased this item the end of November 2015.,13785,1
13785,It is now 2-11-2016 and the coat is falling apart.,13785,1
13785,"The zipper broke, the back seam is splitting and it looks old and shabby.",13785,1
13786,Broke the same day.,13786,1
13786,Cheap.,13786,1
13787,"FIrst, understand that the rating really has nothing to do with the product itself...like so many shoe manufacturers, these do not come in widths (at least not on Amazon).",13787,1
13787,Medium width just won't get it for me.,13787,1
13787,"Some suggested that it would stretch, but I seriously doubted they would have stretched enough for me.",13787,1
13788,"super cheap, fit weird, way to small, especially the bottoms.",13788,1
13788,Would not buy again,13788,1
13789,Never buy a shirt from china or japan too small,13789,1
13790,Silver coating was off within a day and the necklace itself was bent.,13790,1
13791,I am so sorry I ordered this!,13791,1
13791,doesn't fix at all,13791,1
13792,I ordered the largest size available (I think 3x) and it was way too small.,13792,1
13792,I gave it to my 11 year old.,13792,1
13792,I will never purchase from them again.,13792,1
13793,usually wear size large.,13793,1
13793,"Couldn't even get it on over my head, let alone my body.",13793,1
13793,Loved the colors.,13793,1
13793,Would love to find a larger one.,13793,1
13794,"The size is Asian size, so I ordered size L, and it is ok, I usually wear size s or m in the USA.",13794,1
13794,And this jacket's packet had been broken when it arrived.,13794,1
13795,Not happy at all.,13795,1
13795,"The picture shows full lining, but its only upto the thigh.",13795,1
13795,A total waste of my money.,13795,1
13796,It ripped as I tried to fit it the 1st time!,13796,1
13797,I am so mad!,13797,1

13797,I ordered 2 not knowing how bad they would be.,13797,1
13797,the second one came with out a button hole also and yes the tassles do looked like a mop!,13797,1
13797,please when you order something make sure they aren't made in china..i am from now on...this isn't the first time..one time I ordered a sweater and it came in a baby size!,13797,1
13797,im so disgusted!,13797,1
13798,I'm 5 foot 3 and usually wear a medium or large but because it's online shopping I bought an extra large and OMG NO ROOM it was SO small!,13798,1
13798,Like if you wear a small buy an extra large because it's not just slim it's VERY short only way you can wear without showing your belly button is wit a pencil skirt,13798,1
13799,an absolute waste of money...it is big to the point of being comically big...also not made well at all,13799,1
13800,It literally looks like someone just shoved some grass in a clear plastic Christmas ornament...disappointed to say the least.,13800,1
13801,I got this for my daughters 13th birthday.,13801,1
13801,The size was wrong.,13801,1
13801,We had to send it back twice!,13801,1

13804,It also did not fit well either.,13804,1
13805,I wear a medium.,13805,1
13805,This fits like an XL,13805,1
13806,"I ordered a large, that is a normal size for me.",13806,1
13806,"Thus top was so so tight, I could hardly get it on and off.",13806,1
13806,I returned it.,13806,1
13807,This shirt is terrible!,13807,1
13807,So so so bad!,13807,1
13807,I opened it and immediately put it back in the packaging to be returned.,13807,1
13807,The fabric is so thin and looks like it'll fall apart any minute.,13807,1
13807,It's completely see through.,13807,1
13807,There's no use for this shirt at all.,13807,1
13807,"You can't go out in public with it and it's too ""dressy"" to wear as bedtime attire.",13807,1
13807,Just ugly and terrible.,13807,1
13807,I guess I should've expected it since it was so cheap.,13807,1
13807,Don't waste your time or money.,13807,1
13808,This is the second one I ordered because the first ring was Amazing.,13808,1
13808,I just did a repeat order and this time the ring was way too small and just looked cheap.,13808,1
13808,I'll be contacting the company to see if they actually care about customer satisfaction.,13808,1
13808,Very disappointed the second time around.,13808,1
13809,Way too small would need at least 2 sizes up,13809,1
13810,Way too large.,13810,1
13810,Ordered women's but think received mens.,13810,1
13810,You can almost put 2 legs in one side.,13810,1
13811,Poor quality.,13811,1
13811,I have to send it back :(,13811,1
13812,Thumb is not free and the size confusing.,13812,1
13813,To small does not fit iPhone 6s Plus.,13813,1
13814,The letters were red not white it's stupid,13814,1
13815,I so wanted to fall in love with these but the face of the sunglasses are a weird yellow orange color vs a true gold.,13815,1
13815,So l looked like l had lemons on my eyes!,13815,1
13816,Cheap chain and metal,13816,1
13817,So I bought this at 9 months pregnant for after my baby was born.,13817,1
13817,I had to guess at what size my post partum waist would need.,13817,1
13817,I went off their size chart but but was at the edge of the velcro area which meant I could not pull it in any further.,13817,1
13817,Went through the return process which I've never had an issue with before.,13817,1
13817,They responded saying they only take returns for manufacturing defects.,13817,1
13817,Incredibly disappointed.,13817,1
13818,This is not a Coach wallet.,13818,1
13818,It is very cheaply made and no where near compares to Coach quality.,13818,1
13818,Very disappointing!,13818,1
13819,So the shoulder straps definitely need serious alterations- like INCHES to high.. very odd.. biggest problem is once you order it you might as well keep it- shipping is so expensive you will lose money returning it.,13819,1
13819,DON't BUY THIS...,13819,1
13820,The dress is beautiful and j wish I could wear it but their size chart and size tag in the dress are completely off.,13820,1
13820,I was very disappointed.,13820,1
13820,"I measured myself, ordered te size according to the chart but when I received the dress it was almost two sizes too small.",13820,1
13821,This romper is oversized and the material looks very cheap,13821,1
13822,I think I got a faulty pair because I love the other leggings by 90 Degree but this pair fell apart at the crotch seam after 2 wears.,13822,1
13822,I always take good care of my leggings so not sure what happened.,13822,1
13823,Crap..,13823,1
13824,Broke soon as I out it on.very cheap made,13824,1
13825,Was not impressed with this shirt at all.,13825,1
13826,Says it's a large!,13826,1
13826,It was made for a little girl.,13826,1
13826,"The part that was the waistline, went across my chest!",13826,1
13826,I wear an eight.,13826,1
13827,Arms were cut very slim.,13827,1
13827,Didn't fit correctly,13827,1
13828,Poor quality fabric and cheaply made shirt.,13828,1
13828,After 1 washing threw it in the trash.,13828,1
13828,Large size shrunk to extra small.,13828,1
13829,I purchased this dress for my daughter.,13829,1
13829,I checked the size guide that the seller posted with the dress.,13829,1
13829,I then read the comments and decided to purchase it two sizes too big.,13829,1
13829,Well I should have purchased it 4 sizes too big.,13829,1
13829,I returned it.,13829,1
13830,Both necklaces broke within the first month.,13830,1
13830,Both chains broke and the hourglass had to be glued back in place twice.,13830,1
13830,The bracelet is nice which is why I'm giving it 1 star.,13830,1
13830,Don't waste your money.,13830,1
13831,Definitely not true to size you may need to buy a couple sizes bigger,13831,1
13832,NOT TRUE TO SIZE.,13832,1
13833,I need a bigger size like a 12 in boys.,13833,1
13834,"Not what it looks like at all, and doesn't fit... when I tried to return it to the store, they said no, instead they'd give me 15% off my order.",13834,1

13836,"The seams are crap and frayed, and in some ppaces, not even finished.",13836,1
13836,This isn't even worth the flannel they bought  for it.,13836,1
13836,"Oh, and it's cheap flannel that's incredibly thin.",13836,1
13836,Save your money and buy a more expensive version through actual Amazon and not one of the Chinese store.,13836,1
13836,"This is the second red plaid dress from over there (1st was a different store) that showed up too ssmall  jacked up, and cheap.",13836,1
13836,Buy  direct from Amazon and spend the 40 bucks.,13836,1

13854,I wear size medium and took large to be on the safe side and it was still too small.,13854,1
13854,The dress looks great!,13854,1
13854,on the website but its horrible!,13854,1
13854,I'll never purchase clothes on Amazon again.,13854,1
13855,To small and am goin to send it back,13855,1
13856,"Meterial was nice, but way to big, and very confusing putting it on.",13856,1
13856,"Straps are all over the place , not a fitting shirt like the picture, I didn't waste my time sending it back.",13856,1
13856,I ordered a large and it was like a xxl,13856,1
13857,Size 38 no it is a 40 on the tag.,13857,1
13857,But probably 42,13857,1
13858,I ordered it in an extra large  but couldn't fit in it.,13858,1
13858,My 16 year old daughter who wears a petite  couldn't even fit in it.,13858,1
13858,It had no tags.,13858,1
13858,I tried to return it but couldn't,13858,1
13859,I was so excited to see these on Amazon.,13859,1
13859,But who are the people who do the sizing?,13859,1
13859,"Unfortunately, these are going back.",13859,1
13859,"I am a 36DD and ordered a 2X, which I certainly thought was going to be loose and comfy.",13859,1
13859,I usually wear a large.,13859,1
13859,Such wasn't the case with the sizing.,13859,1
13859,The 2X fit as though it was a medium.,13859,1
13859,Very snug around the bust and waist.,13859,1
13859,I don't even think a 3X would fit comfortably.,13859,1
13860,Very bad.,13860,1
13860,Cheap material looks like table cloth,13860,1
13861,It too small and the material quality was very poor,13861,1
13862,The only thing I like about this item was that it was cheap.,13862,1
13862,"It was not this bright fun pink, but more of a coral color.",13862,1
13862,It is also designed really bazar.,13862,1
13862,"The two pieces that look like a normal top are actually two separate really, really, REALLY long straps.",13862,1
13862,"It is so odd looking to have these two straps that when tied, hang below ones' bottom.",13862,1
13862,"Also, I could see if you were having a good ol time and not paying attention to how or where these straps have moved to (because they will move) you can become Instagram famous with a nip slip!",13862,1
13863,This dress was way too big!,13863,1
13864,Come from china cheaply made!,13864,1
13865,"I got it without case ,I mean the black bag
Just the sunglasses",13865,1
13866,It felt like I was wearing them backwards...too small in the back and too big in the front.,13866,1
13866,"But wore them anyway and a few hours in, the elastic separated from the fabric.",13866,1
13866,"Now you might be thinking that's what happens when they are too small in the back, but the rip occurred in the too big area.",13866,1
13866,Sending them back.,13866,1
13867,This is short and small.,13867,1
13867,And it's too late to return it.,13867,1
13868,Even if I could've given half a star....I wouldn't!,13868,1
13868,I am so disappointed in the bag I really do think I could've just bought reusable bag from Walmart.,13868,1
13868,The only reason why I'm keeping is because it's waterproof.,13868,1
13869,"Extremely short dress, I had to give it away because it was too short even though it was a Medium (which is usually my size)",13869,1
13870,Zipper broke right away.,13870,1
13870,Argh!,13870,1
13871,I have a large bust and medium hips.,13871,1
13871,"The top is stretchy and looks great, but the bottom is cut very weird: first of all, it's is very small and does not stretch in the right places.",13871,1
13871,"Second of all and most importantly, it is NOT open at the crotch.",13871,1
13871,"It is open at the front and back, with a piece of fabric sewn in at the crotch, opposite of the description that indicated it was open or crotchless.",13871,1
13872,Order 3 sizes up to get that look the Itty bitty model has except it will still be quite shorter in the front.,13872,1
13872,The material reminds me of worn out cheap bed sheets,13872,1
13873,Wow if anything can be any more badly made I would buy that instead looks nothing like the picture looks like a five year old stamped a picture on this,13873,1
13874,It takes way to long to get this order,13874,1
13875,arrived with black stains all over the skirt portion of dress--looks like the color from the top part of dress (black) bled onto the bottom part (white),13875,1
13876,Does not stick to mirror.,13876,1
13876,Nor my cabinets.,13876,1
13876,Nor my tiles.,13876,1
13876,Do not buy this case if you want something that truly works.,13876,1
13877,It's not the fit... this is CHEAP!,13877,1
13877,It is really tacky looking and not attractive at all.,13877,1
13877,I wouldn't recommend it.,13877,1
13877,"Also, I received 2 packages.",13877,1
13877,Both were from China.,13877,1
13877,Neither one had any paperwork with it...,13877,1
13877,I think that is strange.,13877,1
13877,In the 2nd package I received a very trampy looking sweater that I never ordered.,13877,1
13877,I don't know if it was intended as a bonus?,13877,1
13877,Really poor quality.,13877,1
13877,I am sending it back.,13877,1
13877,It's terrible.,13877,1
13878,My partner has twin 2 year old girls.,13878,1
13878,I purchased one Fluttershy and one Pinkie Pie dress in size 2/3.,13878,1
13878,The Pinkie Pie dress was an accurate 2/3.,13878,1
13878,"The FLuttershy dress was easily a size 4/5, so I returned it and reordered BOTH a 2/3 and an 18/24m to see which would fit and BOTH of the new ones were also a size 4/5.",13878,1
13878,I've decided to return all of them and buy from an authentic seller.,13878,1
13878,These dresses are knock-offs: the real ones will have a My Little Pony Logo on the inside back collar.,13878,1
13879,The shoes definitely are a cheap copy of other model...,13879,1
13879,The picture is fake... Do not buy them...,13879,1
13880,poor quality,13880,1
13881,These shirts are dry clean only.,13881,1
13881,Who is going to dry clean their work out gear.,13881,1
13881,Made incredibly small.,13881,1

13893,"Low Quality, Not like the picture.",13893,1
13893,Fabric is cheap,13893,1
13894,"These fit fine around the waist and in the legs and backside, but they are entirely too tight around the penis and scrotum.",13894,1
13894,"They are also cheaply made, (the waist band separated from the briefs after 1 wash), but considering the price that's no surprise.",13894,1
13895,"This dress is definitely not one size fits all, it was too large",13895,1
13896,Size was a large but it must have been a child's large,13896,1

13905,They were no where close to accurate sizing.,13905,1
13905,You should make it clearer that they are padded.,13905,1
13905,The padding takes up so much of the space in the cops.,13905,1
13905,I returned them.,13905,1
13906,this should not be listed as a plus size suit - bought the XXL and it fits like a normal M -,13906,1

13907,Poor quality.,13907,1

13912,"My son really loved these and they looked great on him, but after the first wash some stitching was coming out at the bottom around the ankle, leaving the hem dangling off.",13912,1
13912,He wore them anyway for his track meet and I washed them again.,13912,1
13912,At that point the stitching around the white stripes came off as well.,13912,1
13912,These are cute but don't hold up well at all.,13912,1
13912,I am very disappointed.,13912,1

13923,Fit my daughter like a dream but it came in the mail with ink stains all over the white part of the skirt :( couldn't get a replacement fast enough for a black and white party we had.... Would've been highly satisfied if the dress hadn't arrived with stains :(,13923,1
13924,If I could give it zero stars I would.,13924,1
13924,I ordered up a size from what I usually wear and it is so extremely small I can't even get both arms in.,13924,1
13924,I'm guessing this is tagged with the wrong size but would cost me more to send back than to throw it away!,13924,1
13925,The Seller is great to work with so I give them 5 stars...but the product does NOT fit like the beautiful picture.,13925,1
13925,The shoulders are extremely small.,13925,1
13925,It didn't even fit my girlfriend (3 sizes smaller).,13925,1
13925,Definitely not like the sizing in the US (and I didn't know that by the description).,13925,1
13925,The Seller asked what was wrong so I'm hopeful that they will make changes in the future so it will fit correctly.,13925,1
13926,The wrong size was sent when I ordered a large.,13926,1
13926,"I checked it on my order, and the error wasn't mine.",13926,1
13926,I like the color of the blouse and quality for the price.,13926,1

13930,I bought this dress for a friend's formal wedding and when it arrived I couldn't believe what I was seeing.,13930,1
13930,The lace is extremely cheap and feels like it will fall apart the moment you take a step.,13930,1
13930,"The entire dress is see through; the only place that are ""covered up"" are two LITTLE pads over the front of the breasts (there's nothing to even hold the pads in place!)",13930,1
13930,and a tiny skirt that barely covers your lower front and rear areas.,13930,1
13930,The size is way off as well....I realized that when ordering from China things tend to be about a size smaller but this is ridiculous!,13930,1

13939,I received this today and thought 'who can fit into this thing?',13939,1
13939,It is so tiny (small does not cut it) that I don't think even my five year old can fit into this thing.,13939,1

13960,They are all the same size!,13960,1
13961,The sizing on the shirts is way off.,13961,1
13961,I ordered an extra large and from the measurements it is about US medium,13961,1
13962,Looks more like a night gown!,13962,1

13963,The color was nice!,13963,1
13963,"And it looks like the picture, except it's very see through so I don't even know how I can wear it.",13963,1
13963,I guess it could be a nice swim cover!,13963,1
13964,The cut of this jacket leaves something to be desired and it is way too short.,13964,1
13964,The shoulder fit nicely if you're going for the padded shoulder 80's look.,13964,1
13965,I never write reviews but I was so disappointed by this bag I had to let it be known.,13965,1
13965,It was extremely stiff and is made of very rough material.,13965,1

13968,"After reading the reviews, I ordered this outfit in all three sizes just in case.",13968,1
13968,The material was fine and the outfit is cute but the sizes are wonky.,13968,1
13968,It's as if they take all the same articles of clothing and sew different size tags on them.,13968,1
13968,"The small and large fit like extra smalls, and the medium was slightly bigger than the large.",13968,1
13968,That's not how sizing is supposed to work.,13968,1

14080,"Bought on prime day a while ago, received the glasses pretty late and they were missing a scew.",14080,1
14080,"Ear pieces were decidedly uneven, took a little bending to look normal.",14080,1
14080,Ended up breaking about a month later near the nose.,14080,1
14081,Sizes run way small.,14081,1
14081,An xl might fit a small person.,14081,1
14082,Waaaay too small.,14082,1
14082,More maternity than Plus Size.,14082,1
14082,Fabric is horrible.,14082,1
14082,Feels like a cheap tablecloth.,14082,1
14083,Extremely poor quality.,14083,1
14083,Lining is larger then flimsy outer material.,14083,1
14083,More like cheap felt then wool.,14083,1
14083,Had to return!,14083,1
14084,"This product is supposed to be an American plus size, yet I just received it n it's most likely an Asian atire, never said this on the description hate I bought it, not represented correctly at all",14084,1
14085,There is no writing on the back.,14085,1
14085,Only the front of the shirt has Conan and the quote.,14085,1
14086,In description it says it is unisex.,14086,1
14086,It is definitely not and the neck is super wide.,14086,1
14086,I would have worn it if the neck wasn't so stank.,14086,1
14086,I wear a Small and ordered a large.,14086,1
14086,Idk how they think this size is a large but ok.,14086,1
14086,It barely fit,14086,1
14087,"I don't know if maybe I got the wrong dress, or they changed the dress, or what, but this was NOTHING like described.",14087,1
14087,"First off, the dress isn't cotton, it's rayon, and incredibly see-through.",14087,1
14087,"Second, it's hideous.",14087,1
14087,The colors are the same but how they're distributed is totally different.,14087,1
14087,All the color blocks are the same size so the dress just looks ugly!,14087,1
14087,"Also, I normally wear a M/L, the large in this fit like a small!",14087,1
14088,I usually wear a 6-8 and this is way too small,14088,1
14089,I did not like these knee high socks at all.,14089,1
14089,"I am 5'6"" and a size 10.",14089,1
14089,"They were definitely stretchy, but they grabbed my legs and made them look horrible.",14089,1
14089,The elastic band was so tight that they caused the socks to roll down.,14089,1
14089,"I am a pretty active person, so I expected these to look good, but they were way too tight.",14089,1
14089,I would not recommend these for any individual who has bigger thighs or legs,14089,1
14090,Useless.,14090,1
14090,"Hinge not secured...broken and, Uh...unhinged!",14090,1
14091,The jewels started coming off the first day I wore it.,14091,1
14091,Not quality at all.,14091,1
14091,Junk.,14091,1
14092,This product was not useful to me.,14092,1
14092,It was a complete waste of money.,14092,1
14092,The root of this is my size.,14092,1
14092,"At 36 weeks pregnant I am 138 pounds and petite, with the exception of my large, round belly.",14092,1
14092,The band was not tight enough until my third trimester.,14092,1
14092,"But when I hit my third trimester, I no longer wanted to wear my old jeans because the buttons would push into my belly and be uncomfortable.",14092,1
14092,So probably a good product but they need a more petite size for people like me.,14092,1
14092,I ended using my Blanqi bodystyler.,14092,1
14092,It was more expensive but I bought two and wore them every single day.,14092,1
14092,They held up my belly and I didn't have back pain even though I have a herniated disk in my lower back.,14092,1
14092,"I also used back support for my exercise, walking around the neighborhood.",14092,1
14093,"Note only does it run small, but my fringe wasn't attached in a couple spots.",14093,1
14093,"Also, the top of the shirt, doesn't lay correct",14093,1
14094,"Actually no I don't like these head bands
I have to untie them so they'll fit but then I can't get them turd back
I actually want to send back",14094,1
14095,We received costume looking much different than picture advertised.,14095,1
14095,My sister and I wanted our children to look the same but she had orange feet and I had brown feet.,14095,1
14095,Front ruffles were different.,14095,1
14095,Face was different.,14095,1
14095,Different shade of brown.,14095,1
14095,Not happy.,14095,1
14096,Was a very small cut shirt....not at all like I thought...for a small frame person...no way plus size..will not order from this Company again...took way too long to arrive.,14096,1
14097,I wish I could exchange for a larger size.,14097,1
14097,It's not true to size at all.,14097,1
14097,The bottoms fit but the top was almost 3 sizes smaller,14097,1
14098,To small what the hell  .,14098,1
14098,No more orders,14098,1
14099,This product was not true to size I ordered a 4x and it looked and fit more like a 2x,14099,1
14100,"This dress is really cute, but way to small.",14100,1
14100,I ordered a Large since they don't have it in XL.,14100,1
14100,"I wear a size 10 usually, and can fit in most L dresses.",14100,1
14100,This is more for someone that is like a size 2 or 4.,14100,1
14101,I'm a 5'7 woman with a 25 inch shoulder span.,14101,1
14101,The sleeves were right and my arms aren't huge.,14101,1
14101,Bought largest size because I've come to experience as a frequent shopper of overseas shirts that you have to order a lot larger than you normally would.,14101,1
14101,I couldn't get the bottom two shut as it was too tight towards the bottom of the shirt.,14101,1
14101,Too bad because I was excited to wear it!,14101,1
14101,:(,14101,1
14102,"don't buy.. not right color, fit funny, and tried to return and could not",14102,1
14103,I ordered an extra large knowing it is in Asian sizes.,14103,1
14103,Still Way.,14103,1
14103,Too.,14103,1
14103,Small.,14103,1
14104,This item is a piece of s***.,14104,1
14104,"Save your money, don't buy it",14104,1
14105,The top of dress was asymmetrical.,14105,1
14105,Do not buy unless you want to spend more money to get it altered.,14105,1
14106,Tooo heavy - will not stay on,14106,1
14107,Do NOT order this top.,14107,1
14107,The top I received is not beige with soft colors as depicted in the picture.,14107,1
14107,It is white and the colors are ugly.,14107,1
14107,I don't believe that they photographed the actual shirt that was delivered because it does not look anything like what I received.,14107,1
14107,"Very disappointing, as the actual top in the picture is very cute.",14107,1
14108,The product was not even close to the size it was suppose to be !,14108,1
14108,It was very stuff and uncomfortable !,14108,1
14108,I sent it back,14108,1

14110,Started turning green after 1 day and then the clasp broke :(,14110,1
14111,Terrible boxer brief.,14111,1
14111,Briefs ride-up very quickly and need constant adjustment.,14111,1
14111,Very uncomfortable.,14111,1
14111,"I've owned many other brands in an attempt to find boxer briefs that do not ride-up, and these are the worst.",14111,1
14111,Don't waste your money.,14111,1
14112,i was so excited when I ordered this skirt.,14112,1
14112,I felt really good about the purchase because some of the other reviews were really good.,14112,1
14112,It's more of an A-line skirt rather than a full skirt.,14112,1
14112,It's also VERY sheer.,14112,1
14112,I'm also missing the tie on my skirt.,14112,1
14112,Maybe mine is defective or maybe there is more than one supplier.,14112,1
14112,I've attached some photos to show what the lining  looks like and the fabric of the skirt over the lining.,14112,1
14113,See-through and too stretchy,14113,1
14114,Terrible material and fit.,14114,1
14114,It doesn't stay down on your shoulders and when it comes up it'll slap you in the face because of the rubber band around the whole neck of it.,14114,1
14114,You can clearly see thru it,14114,1
14115,These are kind of stiff and the cups are way too big.,14115,1
14116,It is a tight fit and the fabric is see-threw.,14116,1

14151,This fanny pack looks nothing as pictured.,14151,1
14151,The shape is not as nicely tapered as it appears in the photo; it's almost fully-rectangular.,14151,1
14151,"The color online is a multi-color ""holographic"" design; in person it is pretty much gold-colored with some holograpic reflection.",14151,1
14151,"The belt is 1.5"" wide, with the belt buckle measuring closer to 2"" wide (which is huge).",14151,1

14153,I would think twice about buying this product online or from Amazon,14153,1
14154,I am a small person and was shocked that the shirt did not fit.,14154,1
14154,The sleeves are so small I am unable to wear the shirt at all.,14154,1
14155,I would give this product 0 Stars if I could.,14155,1

14156,"I'm a size 8, which put me in the medium range according to the size chart.",14156,1
14156,So I ordered a Large to be on the safe side.,14156,1

14167,"I got the wrong leggings I ordered ankle length black and grey ones and got knee length with zippers all black ones , the quality doesn't look too bad I'm pretty disappointed I got the wrong ones.",14167,1
14168,Way too short compared to picture.,14168,1
14168,Don't buy unless you're expecting a shorty scarf for winter.,14168,1
14169,It runs way to small,14169,1
14170,I ordered this without reading the reviews.,14170,1
14170,Not a good move.,14170,1
14170,Because I would've been prepared for what I was getting.,14170,1
14170,These aren't cotton.,14170,1
14170,More like nylon tights.,14170,1
14170,They don't stretch much.,14170,1
14170,Hard to put on.,14170,1
14170,I'd say order 2 sizes up from what you'd normally wear.,14170,1
14171,"If you have a really short torso, this is the garment for you!",14171,1

14176,"waist, although on the second-to-end hole.",14176,1
14176,But the quality of the leather was miserable.,14176,1
14176,"The belt was splotchy, with dark, worn-looking spots all over the finish.",14176,1
14176,It looked like a consrtuction worker had worn this belt on the job for about five years before they sent it to me.,14176,1
14176,Atitlan obviously has NO quality control on their merchandize.,14176,1
14176,"This appeared to be made of badly-used leather, not a new belt.",14176,1
14176,I am returning it for a refund and will not buy from this company again.,14176,1
14177,Ok...I've used several different tools to remove links from a lot of watch bracelets.,14177,1
14177,This tool is bar for the worst I've ever used.,14177,1

14200,The hoops are round when they should have been teardrop shape and it wasn't longer in any specific area.,14200,1
14200,I tried to bend the metal hoops after I made them smaller and ended up snapping one.,14200,1
14200,"At that point I used tape to put it back together which in turn DID make it teardrop shape, which was ok.

With the length being so short, I had to wear it around my thighs.",14200,1

14236,This one seems at least one size too small.,14236,1
14236,"But that's just me, maybe it'll actually be fine for you...?",14236,1

14242,Even though these socks are supposed to fit from size 10 to 12.,14242,1
14242,I wear a size 11 and they are falling off my feet.,14242,1

14243,The optics on the glasses make everything yellowish and blurry.,14243,1
14243,The micro cloth that comes with it is like rubber and  the case zipper broke after a few times.,14243,1

14253,They either slipped or bunched up at the heels.,14253,1
14253,I added a photo of them bunching at the heels.,14253,1
14253,I tend to wear these types of socks with slip on flats or another time of flat shoe.,14253,1
14253,I attempted to wear them with boots one time and it was a total fail.,14253,1
14253,Not sure why I tried that.,14253,1

14259,"I clicked to order the exact same thing, marked 'crew sock' and showing a photo of a sock that comes up several inches above the ankle.",14259,1
14259,"What I *received* was a pair of MINI crews, that barely clear my ankle, and which are more lightly padded than the trail hiking crew.",14259,1

14522,It's a scam.,14522,1
14523,I gave it one star ONLY because it wouldn't allow me to submit my review without doing so.,14523,1
14523,It DOES NOT fit my Galaxy S6 phone!,14523,1
14523,I regret purchasing this phone case!,14523,1
14523,Shameful,14523,1
14524,Horrible quality - very very cheapily made.,14524,1
14524,Design peels off after one wash. Bummer.,14524,1
14525,"This is a joke, I ordered this item because I was looking for something long, I'm 5'8 and this is what I got;(",14525,1
14526,I wear a 2X so I ordered a 3X.,14526,1
14526,Could not even pull it over my head.,14526,1
14527,Too much material in body of top and too tight in arm band.,14527,1
14527,Would have returned it but restocking fee did not make it worthwhile.,14527,1
14528,Wasn't at all like pictured.,14528,1
14528,The solid blue top piece came all the way down to my belly button.,14528,1
14528,So that empire waist look wasn't there at all.,14528,1
14528,And it didn't have the scooped neckline like pictured.,14528,1
14528,I've ordered from this company before and have found it's a hit or miss and there are some odd mishaps in their clothing.,14528,1
14528,A similiar dress I ordered had the seam in the front of the dress rather than the back.,14528,1
14528,As if they sewed the bottom part on backwards.,14528,1
14528,I noticed my neighbor ordered this exact same dress and hers was just like it was pictured.,14528,1
14528,Best described: I think some people at this company have been sewing for a while and can make the dress.,14528,1
14528,"And then those who are new, they don't know how to sew at all but have a manikin to look at so they attempt to make the dress by looking at it.",14528,1
14528,It really is a hit or miss on whether you'll get something made correctly or not.,14528,1
14528,"Also, the fabric is that real stretchy inexpensive fabric that really needs a slip or something under it.",14528,1
14529,Terribly flimsy...poor quality.,14529,1
14529,"Returning both of the 2 that I bought, need a refund",14529,1

14535,Looked nothing like the photo was very disappointed.,14535,1
14535,I was unpleasantly surprised because this particular brand makes great shirts and blouses but this one I was under whelmed.,14535,1
14536,Not really what I expected and difficult to clasp.,14536,1
14537,Cheap product.,14537,1
14537,Will return.,14537,1
14537,Material is itchy.,14537,1
14538,"These insoles felt really comfortable, the size was perfect (I'm a size 9 women's), and it could probably fit in almost any shoe.",14538,1
14538,"The problem is when I stepped on the insole, the arch fell completely flat.",14538,1
14538,I couldn't believe it- zero arch support.,14538,1
14538,I have what's called a flexible flat foot so I bought it for the arch support.,14538,1
14538,"These insoles did absolutely nothing for me, so I sent them back.",14538,1
14538,The search continues.,14538,1
14538,Hope this helps.,14538,1
14539,This product is just all wrong.,14539,1
14539,"I am 125 lbs and 5'6"" I ordered a medium.",14539,1
14539,I can get the bathing suit on but the boob pads are around my stomach.,14539,1
14539,I removed them and now the awkward cut of the material makes me look flat chested.,14539,1

14545,The zipper on this thing failed the first two days of school.,14545,1
14545,This thing is garbage.,14545,1
14546,I assumed the shirts were child's size..my bad...the boys still liked them and the quality represented the price ...,14546,1
14547,VERY POOR I bought 9 of these for a show.,14547,1
14547,the plastic form inside the top started breaking as soon as we tried to use them.,14547,1
14547,"I discovered it too late to return them, so I wasted a lot of money.",14547,1

14552,Maybe even two sizes small,14552,1
14553,Runs way to big even after I returned for a small size.,14553,1
14553,I needed to donated it due to being to big .,14553,1
14554,The hat felt incredibly cheap.,14554,1
14554,The fit was way too tight for a large size hat.,14554,1
14554,There was this rather odd and ridiculous tropical - floral pattern on the inner mesh.,14554,1
14554,(My fault for not noticing in the description I suppose).,14554,1

14595,I ordered the multi-colored skirt and top and they sent the black one so I'm sending it back.,14595,1
14595,Probably for the best because the quality isn't great.,14595,1
14595,The stitching on the front looks very shabby and the material is very thin.,14595,1

14602,Only fit if you were a tiny Asian woman!,14602,1
14603,"This ""shirt"" is literally a slab of material sewn in two different places to make a draped cover!",14603,1
14603,It has zero edged seams to make it an actual nice piece of clothing; the bottom isn't even doubled back and sewn to make a nice band around your hips so the shirt will stay down and in place on your body.,14603,1
14603,"Let alone the fact that this ""shirt"" isn't even long enough to reach below my waist and fit like the photo shows.",14603,1
14603,"And I'm a little person too, at only 5'3"" and 120lbs, I purchased the Medium thinking I'd should be perfect...yeah, nope!!",14603,1

14605,Absolutely TINY!!,14605,1

14606,When I opened this package up I was unbelievably disappointed at the design.,14606,1
14606,These wouldn't make it through a weekend.,14606,1
14606,I decided I would at least try the heat to see how well it worked.,14606,1
14606,I figured I could at least have them near my couch and use them while sitting.,14606,1
14606,"After two batches of batteries, I have yet to feel any heat.",14606,1

14610,"Crappy material, it's not a long jacket it's a short that stops right below mid waist.",14610,1
14611,Do not use if you get migraines!,14611,1
14611,It triggered migraines when I wore it.,14611,1
14612,Waist of money.,14612,1
14612,Cheap crap.,14612,1

14620,Ugly product!,14620,1
14620,Picture is much better than the dress.,14620,1
14621,I looked everywhere for beachy style pants that would be long enough to fit me.,14621,1
14621,I am 6'0 tall.,14621,1
14621,I ordered a large.,14621,1
14621,"Let me start of by the feel, these pants feel like wool against a sunburn, they are extremely itchy...I washed them about 5 times before I wore them.",14621,1
14621,"And now for the fit, like I said, I ordered a large, they were long enough, and I were a size 32"" Jean and they fix the waist....For about an hour.",14621,1
14621,After that I wish I had a pair of suspenders to hold these bad boys up.,14621,1
14621,They stretch out like crazy and there's no keeping these bad boys hoisted up.,14621,1

14622,"I  ordered  two  the  same  size; one  was  big  enough  for  a  twelve  year  old  anorexic; the  other  was  big  enough  to  fit  me, the  queen  of  desserts.",14622,1
14623,"I fell in love with the picture and ordered a sweater,  I received something like t- shirt material with similar print and didn't hang like picture either.",14623,1
14623,It's no where near the picture.,14623,1
14623,The old bait and switch.,14623,1

14635,The label very clearly has a 6 on it.,14635,1
14635,This outfit will probably fit my child when she's a year old.,14635,1
14635,I contacted the seller and they basically told me the sizing was right and to deal with it.,14635,1
14636,this is the worst swimwear i've ever seen .,14636,1
14636,it's awful.,14636,1
14637,Horrible!,14637,1
14637,The cheapest Material I ever seen almost transparent,14637,1
14638,Not what the picture is .,14638,1

14640,horrible.,14640,1
14641,There is no elasticity in this suit.,14641,1
14641,It was plenty big but I was falling out.,14641,1
14641,Poorly made!,14641,1
14642,OMG.,14642,1
14642,They need to learn how to measure correctly.,14642,1
14642,The dress is huge and the straps are not even.,14642,1
14642,You put it on and one side is higher than the other.,14642,1
14642,The strap that goes across the back is so long it hangs down.,14642,1
14642,The dress reminds me of a table cloth it is that kind of material.,14642,1
14642,The picture makes the dress look adorable but in person its cheaply made.,14642,1
14642,Maybe if i get bored i will try and cut and redo the straps and maybe wear it as a bathing suit cover up or ill just throw it away.,14642,1
14642,Don't waste your money your better off flushing it down the toilet and watching it go down  than ordering this dress to be honest.,14642,1
14643,Did last long at all.,14643,1
14644,All of them broke a month after the return deadline!,14644,1

14646,My greatest disappointment was the baby outfit.,14646,1
14646,I chose blue as the baby is a boy.,14646,1
14646,The matching baby cloths are too girly.,14646,1
14647,"My brother in law sneakers are size 10, but this ones came really really big (the label said: US size 10, but they look like 11 or 12).",14647,1
14648,It's more a Tshirt and I got a large,14648,1

14665,Very disappointed when received.,14665,1
14665,"I was very excited when I ordered it, then very sadly disappointed when I opened the package.",14665,1
14666,Wearing this romper backwards makes more sense than wearing it how it is meant to be worn.,14666,1
14666,It's honestly cut in the weirdest pattern that I don't think anyone ever tried the pattern on before making copies!,14666,1

14902,The color of the fabric turned out to be a solid baby blue color and not at all the denim look I was thinking.,14902,1
14902,"Fits ok, but overall, not at all the look that I was going for.",14902,1
14903,super small.,14903,1
14903,"I'm usually a medium, extra large just barely fits.",14903,1
14903,pretty sure it's polyester.,14903,1
14903,save your money and pass on this one.,14903,1
14904,This bathing suit is not flattering to my body.,14904,1
14904,I was so disappointed!,14904,1
14905,fit good but mage was blurred.,14905,1
14905,not happy,14905,1
14906,A big disappointment.,14906,1
14906,"The blouse in the photo is much different from the real item; for example, the lace is in the photo is substantial and cream colored, the product has cheap looking gold metallic lace.",14906,1
14906,"The chiffon is totally see through, despite an acetate panel under the front.",14906,1
14906,The seams are either poorly sewn or coming apart.,14906,1
14906,Overall the workmanship is shoddy.,14906,1
14906,Amazon has always please me in the past but this item should be removed from the market.,14906,1
14907,Took waaaay to long to arrive and isn't reliable.,14907,1
14907,Not worth the buy.,14907,1
14908,Costume material!,14908,1
14908,Very disappointed,14908,1
14909,"The ""leather"" is peeling off after just a few months of wearing it occasionally.",14909,1
14909,"I wish the warranty covered wear and tear....Despite how cute it truly is, it's not worth the price.",14909,1
14909,More like a $20 watch,14909,1
14910,Didn't like it.,14910,1
14910,Cheap piece for sure.,14910,1
14910,Picture looks  a lot better than it is.,14910,1
14911,Not at all what the picture described.,14911,1
14911,These where cheap see through socks,14911,1
14912,Company doesn't know how to make American sizes,14912,1
14913,I bought these to replace a missing screw back for my earrings.,14913,1
14913,I read the reviews and multiple stated that they worked on screw back earrings.,14913,1
14913,When I tried to put them on they did not stay on.,14913,1
14913,Luckily they only cost $10 but I am still looking for a decent replacement.,14913,1
14914,I purchased an XL.,14914,1
14914,It would not fit me and I wear a size 8.,14914,1
14914,My friend who wears size 4 could barely fit in to the XL.,14914,1
14914,This is a charming blouse designed for a broomstick or perhaps a toothpick.,14914,1
14914,Lol..,14914,1
14914,"I have to laugh at myself here, but seriously, the sizing guidelines are simply inaccurate.",14914,1
14915,"I am normally a medium and because of reviews I ordered a XXL, this looks like it is a children's shirt and could fit my 6 year old niece.",14915,1
14915,It is also very thin.,14915,1
14915,I knew I shouldn't have wasted the money on it.,14915,1
14916,No way is this Capri a plus size.,14916,1
14917,"Not the shirt in the picture, the cut is completely different when they delivered it.",14917,1
14917,Horrible quality,14917,1
14918,Well i got my wireless portable charger and.....it was smaller than whay it looked like in the picture.,14918,1
14918,When you unplug the charger it doesn't charge without the cable connected.,14918,1
14919,Size was way off,14919,1
14920,I like the look of the watch and the strap looks good - a very clean look.,14920,1
14920,That's about it.,14920,1
14920,Adjusting the settings is very spastic and there are no instructions that come with the piece.,14920,1
14920,I had to go to YouTube and found some instructions which I copied/pasted into Word.,14920,1
14920,"Apparently setting these led watches is kind of universal; that was okay, but this watch was impossible.",14920,1
14920,The sensor spot (indicated by he index finger on the image) is not very responsive.,14920,1
14920,"Sometimes it acts like it's dead, then the screen will light up.",14920,1
14920,"Making a selection to choose 12/24 flashes rapidly and it's hit or miss that when you try to choose, it'll stop on the wrong choice.",14920,1
14920,"Same thing happens when you try to change the hour/minute, etc.",14920,1
14920,"I finally had it set, I thought, put the watch on my wrist, and a minute later the time lit up, the wrong time.",14920,1
14920,On and on it went.,14920,1
14920,"Perhaps it's just this watch, but I wouldn't waste any more time/money on this model.",14920,1
14921,Wouldn't give one star if that was an option.,14921,1
14921,BUYER BEWARE!,14921,1
14921,"The most recent reviews, which were posted after I ordered this towel, are correct.",14921,1
14921,"I received a towel with stiching already starting to come undone in one corner, and very thin and poor quality.",14921,1
14921,"To give you an idea of how cheap and thin this towel is, if I fold up one of my hand towels and this towel into roughly the same size square, and place them side by side, they occupy the same amount of space!!",14921,1
14921,When I contacted the seller to ask for a return based on the defect and quality I was told that unless I accepted a replacement towel I would be charged a 25% restock fee!,14921,1
14921,Unacceptable!,14921,1
14921,Will not be ordering from this seller again!,14921,1
14922,"way way too small and I am petite and small, this will only fit a 9-10 yr olds",14922,1

14927,There's a loose flap of fabric in the back that can't be held in place.,14927,1
14927,It goes under the lacing in the back.,14927,1
14927,This dress is difficult to put on.,14927,1
14927,The shoulder straps had to be shortened.,14927,1
14927,The worst part is we have no confidence that the back view won't reveal underwear or bare skin at the worst moment.,14927,1
14927,"It's a cute dress, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't have access to a seamstress.",14927,1
14928,"Get what you pay for, looks like vinyl.",14928,1
14928,Would be good for little girls purse,14928,1
14929,I've had this bracelet on for 1 hour and the hair tie has fallen off 3 times.,14929,1
14929,Waste of money.,14929,1
14930,Shorter than expected and the material was very cheap.,14930,1
14930,Felt like a flimsy tablecloth made for a picnic,14930,1
14931,Not made for American women,14931,1

14933,I am returning this product.,14933,1
14934,This band does not work.,14934,1

14934,You are better off without it.,14934,1
14934,Try The Wig Grip.,14934,1
14934,More expensive $20 but it works.,14934,1
14934,The beige color blends with the monofilament tops perfectly and you can tug fairly hard and your wig won't budge.,14934,1
14934,Out on a speed boat without a worry.,14934,1
14935,"Oh my, all I wanted was a cute purple nightie to wear around the house.",14935,1
14935,"This fabric is so sheer it's like a sexy negligee, I can't wear this around the house I have kids and their friends in/out of the house.",14935,1

14938,"I am 5'7"" and this was so small.",14938,1
14939,"The ""dress"" is really beautiful however it's not a dress.",14939,1
14939,"The material is COMPLETELY see through, it comes with a sash in the same material to tie it closed (making it more like a robe or a beach cover up).",14939,1
14939,The most interesting part is why there are no photos showing the back.,14939,1
14939,The dress has a huge slit right up the middle of the back exposing your entire back side.,14939,1
14939,"I was hoping to wear this as a dress to a friends birthday, I'm not even sure I would wear this as a bikini cover up since my whole backside would still be exposed.",14939,1

14942,Very uncomfortable too.,14942,1
14943,"As.soon as I opened it, it was broke, very disappointing, and so big it could fit an elephant!",14943,1
14944,This was a disappointment.,14944,1
14944,Its just a plain clear case with a sticker on it.,14944,1
14945,Material is sharp solid colors not a worn look to it.,14945,1
14945,The blue is chocolate Browns and teal not black and grey as it looks.,14945,1
14945,The pink is dark gray not w any taupe or softer worn look of color to it.,14945,1
14945,It is nylon and will not distress.,14945,1
14945,I've tried.,14945,1
14945,If u want it fit like photo buy 3 sizes larger.,14945,1
14945,I bought larger and it was not a comfy oversize as it said in description.,14945,1
14945,I did not see review about material or colors.,14945,1

14947,Awful chintzy-feeling slippery fabric.,14947,1
14947,The smocking is scratchy with very protruding seams making a flattering fit impossible.,14947,1

14947,"Extremely unflattering, cheap-feeling and shoddily-made.",14947,1
14948,This dress is not even worth a star but I give it one anyway.,14948,1

14950,"The metal must not be surgical steel, I began getting irritation from wearing these.",14950,1
14950,I also had the rusting issue in the skull that others describe.,14950,1
14950,I discontinued use and threw away because of how poor they were and what they did to me.,14950,1
14951,I've never seen this in my life.,14951,1
14952,"This is a lightweight jacket, not heavy enough to be called a coat.",14952,1

14956,"Shipped on time and was the correct item but the image was dark, could barely see it.",14956,1

14971,Ugly shiny color in person,14971,1
14972,Size 3x was more like a 1x,14972,1
14973,Not what I thought it would be,14973,1
14974,Product doesn't even deserve a star.,14974,1
14974,"""One-size-fits-all"" is a joke.",14974,1
14974,it fits my 5 1/2-year-old daughter perfect though so I guess it wasn't a complete waste,14974,1
14975,These run very small.,14975,1
14975,"My husband wears a size medium in all American brief style underwear, so I ordered a Large per seller's instructions.",14975,1

14976,"We thought it might have been the battery so we replaced it, but the lights were still no longer working.",14976,1
14976,Very disappointed in the extremely short shelf-life of this product and received a poor customer service response when we brought this to the attention of the sellers.,14976,1
14977,I ordered using the sizing chart and it's at least 3 sizes too small.,14977,1
14977,The size is not on a tag or any other indication on the dress.,14977,1
14977,The color is also not as indicated.,14977,1

14977,"It's an extremely light color,nowhere near the grassy green that shows in the picture.",14977,1
14977,"There is no tag on it anywhere, so if I wasn't returning it I'm sure it would be very comfortable to wear.",14977,1
14977,It also makes me wonder if the lack of a tag or size indication on the packaging means they're just guessing when they throw it in the box to ship?,14977,1
14977,?,14977,1
14978,The teeth look great and very real but I couldn't get them to work.,14978,1
14978,Would have been great if they would just have slipped in the mouth like a mouth piece.,14978,1

14978,To hard to work.,14978,1
14978,A waste of my money,14978,1

14985,The armpit ripped after I used it once.,14985,1
14985,Do not buy this item.,14985,1
14986,The product itself is nicely made and soft against skin.,14986,1
14986,Fits well and looks like advertised except instead of a rosy color as pictured (a darker pinkish hue) it's red - bright bright Christmas red!,14986,1
14986,Not what was wanted or advertised.,14986,1
14986,I'll be returning and finding similar item in correct color.,14986,1
14987,Im not happy with these petals at all.,14987,1
14987,They are stiff and don't lay smoothly.,14987,1
14987,Talking them off hurts because it's like regular glue and and pulls and leave red marks that take a few days to go away.,14987,1
14987,I will not be buying these petals again,14987,1
14988,Too small for an XL.,14988,1

14989,"Within a day, the strap came off.",14989,1

14995,I'm definitely returning this dress.,14995,1
14996,This was nothing like I expected.,14996,1
14996,The hat is an extremely cheap hat that would probably cost $2 or less with a cheap looking iron on image.,14996,1
14996,The bill has a white trim that makes the hat look even cheaper (and is not shown on the image they provide).,14996,1
14997,the dangly part fell off within a day,14997,1
14998,I ordered an extra large and it was too small for my 00 little sister.,14998,1
14999,I ordered these gloves with high hopes but once I received the gloved and wore them outside that dream went up in smoke.,14999,1
14999,Wearing the gloves in 15- 20 degrees  was like rubbing ice on your raw skin.,14999,1
14999,What little wind we did have felt like it was blowing right through the gloves.,14999,1
14999,"I pulled out my well worn 20 year old gloves ( non goretex, nothing special gloves) and was much warmer and the feeling in my fingers returned.",14999,1
14999,I would not recommend anyone to buy them.,14999,1
14999,They might make a good chew toy for my dogs,14999,1
15000,These are NOT over-the-calf socks.,15000,1
15000,If my wife had not opened and washed them to surprise me I would have returned them.,15000,1
15000,They go up the calf but stop far short of the top of the calf.,15000,1
15000,"Three washings and two wearings and two socks already have holes, in the top of the foot area, a place socks just do not wear out!",15000,1

15002,These are much too small.,15002,1
15003,The top fitted fine a little weird and the bottom was EXTREMELY small.,15003,1
15003,Made no sense :(,15003,1
15004,Wow!,15004,1
15004,These were TINY!,15004,1
15004,"Also, the smell of the chemicals or whatever they used to print the flag on the pocket, is overwhelming.",15004,1
15004,Not worth it.,15004,1
15005,"Unfortunately, this wasn't the product as shown.",15005,1
15005,I got white leggings with a different print.,15005,1
15006,Broke within a couple of hours of wearing.,15006,1
15006,I noticed that extra glue had been applied in an effort to fix the faulty cufflink.,15006,1
15006,Basically a waste of money as no use and the seller has not responded to my request to replace/fix.,15006,1
15006,Very disappointed.,15006,1
15007,"Broke and with how much it is, I'm mad.",15007,1
15008,I was forced to give this one star.,15008,1
15008,This is for a very short little person.,15008,1
15008,I got this in 3x which  usually fits a little loose but i could barely get this on and it didn't even come midrift.,15008,1
15009,"The print to the shirt you can barely see
I ordered black and gold
and I received black with grey print
Size is pretty small too",15009,1

15012,its not what i spected if i could returned them back that would be great and regularr black sunglasses,15012,1
15013,Small and a horrible plastic like fabric.,15013,1
15013,Also white looks kind of dirty.,15013,1
15014,I didn't like the material and it didn't fit correctly.,15014,1
15015,They were very small,15015,1
15016,"it didn't came what i bought, what came was a horrible costume",15016,1

15019,Huge - gave them to my much larger brother who liked them.,15019,1
15020,"Like a lot of the other 1 star reviewers, my watch winder also stopped working after 13 months.",15020,1
15020,"One of the motors still works, but the one controlling the two right winders does not.",15020,1
15020,So now I only have a single watch winder.,15020,1
15020,This is my second watch winder (my first was just a single winder).,15020,1
15020,"I don't remember the brand, but it too stopped working after about a year.",15020,1
15020,"For a fairly simple mechanical device, I have no idea why it is so difficult to make a watch winder that lasts more than a year.",15020,1
15021,"The itam said the color was white, and the photo looked white.",15021,1
15021,"However, they were cream which totally defeated my purpose for buying them.",15021,1
15022,No size on description.,15022,1

15024,It was so awful I didn't even want to take a picture in it!,15024,1
15025,For a short time this case was great but after 2-3 cm day the case started to break chunks of the edges..... not happy but it will do,15025,1
15026,"Way to small,,I bought this as a gift and was so embarrassed when the plus size woman opened it...It was small enough to fit her 14 year old daughter!",15026,1
15027,The timer never worked.,15027,1
15028,"my second one that I purchased was really bad quality it came apart from the seems, I will give this produc one more chance I am about to purchase a third one hopefully it's not bad quality.",15028,1
15029,I personally didn't like it.,15029,1
15029,I expected the heart charm to be a little bigger.,15029,1
15029,It's about the size of a dime.,15029,1
15029,The orb in the center of the heart is a bead that doesn't even glow very well.,15029,1
15030,"Tried 2 sizes, medium and large and both didn't fit.",15030,1
15030,They were way to tight and I normally wear a medium in tops.,15030,1
15031,Was a cheap material.,15031,1
15031,Didn't fit a medium size person.,15031,1
15032,This dress does not work like other convertible dresses I have owned.,15032,1

15091,I will find someone to give it to someday.,15091,1
15092,Very disappointed....seriously I tried it on then put it back on this morning and this is what I get....ripped horrible quality.,15092,1
15092,Sad because it's so cute but the bra doesn't fit small chested girls and I ordered a small had to tie the top instead of just tightening it.,15092,1
15092,Now I get to sew my own swimsuit that should have been sewn right in the first place!,15092,1
15092,Fix this!,15092,1
15093,Some was crooked and it turned my daughter's finger green,15093,1
15094,No comment,15094,1
15095,Ugh- the material is so cheap and synthetic,15095,1
15096,Chain was good quality.,15096,1

15101,JUNK!!,15101,1
15101,!,15101,1
15102,The dress is beautiful.,15102,1
15102,However they made the top part so that the cup of the breast is way too high which Cuts underneath the arm.,15102,1
15102,If you went with the bigger size and the dress would be way too big.,15102,1
15102,The cup that comes within the dress is literally up right below your collarbone.,15102,1
15102,Either I'll have to pay to have it altered or return it.,15102,1
15103,Received a broken hat.,15103,1
15104,This swimsuit is so small that it barely fit my 14 year old.,15104,1
15104,I had to give it to her because the top was so little I could barely go around my thigh.,15104,1
15104,These can't be adult swimming suits!!,15104,1
15104,So disappointed!!,15104,1

15106,"Too big, too baggy, too matronly.",15106,1
15106,Not at all attractive.,15106,1
15106,The dumb little skirt at the front just drags it down more.,15106,1
15106,I wear it when no one's around & I just want to swim.,15106,1
15107,I received the item  on time but it was defective.,15107,1
15107,The zipper complete ripped off as soon as I zipped it down before even trying it on.,15107,1
15107,I still like the costume so  I ordered a second one and was told I could not get one day shipping anymore  even though the damaged costume literally got to me the day after I purchased it so tone that made no sense .,15107,1
15107,I'm just very disappointed in he quality of the costume and their costumer service.,15107,1
15107,Now I wasted money on two of their costumes and can't wear neither one to the party I bought it for .,15107,1
15108,It wasn't what I hoped it would be.,15108,1
15109,Actually came with uneven lids and labeled as His & His..,15109,1
15109,"I had to mark Hers, myself..",15109,1
15110,Didn't fit the phone at all.,15110,1

15111,DISLIKE!,15111,1
15112,Shipping is super slow took weeks to get here and then when she put it on the bottoms fit fine but the top is like two sizes small she can not pick her arms up at all or her stomach shows.,15112,1
15112,If she was wearing it like the girl in the picture with her arms to her sides it might hold it down.,15112,1
15112,This is my first bad experience shopping on Amazon.,15112,1
15113,TERRIBLE!,15113,1
15113,DON'T BUY THIS!,15113,1
15113,My earrings came broken and looked as if they were missing a piece and wouldn't fit in my ear the back pieces to close the earrings broke right when i touched them!,15113,1

15118,Had a stain on it NASTY,15118,1
15119,It was suppose to be a xxl but it was like a medium.,15119,1
15120,So I've ordered other products from Spiral and been pleased with the quality of the material and the vivid colors.,15120,1
15120,This product is down right poor.,15120,1
15120,"For the price, I expected a lot more.",15120,1
15120,See the purple in the picture?,15120,1
15120,Doesn't exist in the product.,15120,1
15120,Just bland gray and boring.,15120,1
15120,And the material is really cheap and thin.,15120,1
15120,"Think pajama pants, not something cool looking like the 'steampunk' look in the picture.",15120,1
15120,Pass on this one.,15120,1
15120,I'm in the process of a return.,15120,1
15121,Very unhappy with product and delivery.,15121,1
15121,Too big on top.,15121,1
15121,And it took 3 times longer then advertised to deliver.,15121,1
15122,"it's too small, 3XL is still small",15122,1
15123,Omg.....looks nothing like the picture!!!!!!,15123,1
15123,!..scam....I am done bying things online thanks to this outfit,15123,1
15124,Was not very good quality it was tarnished inside.,15124,1
15125,I was so excited to find an affordable suit that might fit a big-busted girl like myself (I am a 34/36DDD depending on the brand).,15125,1
15125,"The cups were HEAVILY molded, yet the straps and back support were non existent!!!",15125,1
15125,It was like wearing 2 styrofoam coffee cups with a string to support them!,15125,1
15125,The bottoms fit fairly well ( I wear a 10/12 in women's pants & ordered the XL just to be safe) but the back was unlined.,15125,1
15125,"I ordered it in the "" light blue"" (actually a very pretty shade of green) and I was afraid it may be see-thru when wet.",15125,1
15125,I am disappointed and returning it.,15125,1
15126,"This product is ridiculous: one cup is small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, the fraying looks cheap, and the band couldn't even fit over my head.",15126,1
15126,I ordered two sizes up and I can't imagine it fitting a small A cup,15126,1
15127,The color does not look like the color as shown in the pictures.,15127,1
15127,It is this and it had a funny smell to it it took very long to come and I wouldn't wasn't my time but this any more.,15127,1
15127,I couldn't get in contact with the seller.,15127,1
15127,I think you shouldn't buy this mess!,15127,1
15128,It runs small but when you wash it it shrinks to nothing.,15128,1
15128,I hand wash and air dry.,15128,1
15129,"I ordered a size bigger and when I got them in the mail, they fitted literally like leggings!",15129,1
15130,"Poorly made, poor sizing",15130,1
15131,Did not,15131,1
15132,Pretty bad product.,15132,1
15132,"You can't really tell from the picture, but it doesn't hold many credit cards, the money pocket is open and not secure at all, and the drivers license section is in plain view for the whole world to see.",15132,1
15132,"there is no security here, and the money could fall out.",15132,1
15132,"this wallet would be fine if it had one more section that wraps around it and covers the open parts, but as it is, it's poorly designed.",15132,1
15132,I'm going to go shopping again and toss this one out.,15132,1
15132,Too bad I already got rid of my other wallet that this one was supposed to replace.,15132,1
15133,I went by the chart and it's about 4 sizes too big.,15133,1
15133,Need to return.,15133,1
15134,Do not purchase this item.,15134,1
15134,You will be terribly disappointed.,15134,1
15134,Absolutely the worst!,15134,1
15134,!,15134,1
15135,"I just received it 20min ago I was going to try it on and the ball won't come off, I tried everything...",15135,1
15135,Waste of money!,15135,1
15135,Never had a bad item before!,15135,1
15135,Looks pretty in my hand.,15135,1
15136,Nowhere close to what's advertised.,15136,1
15136,don't buy from here,15136,1
15137,2x is a size 6 panty,15137,1
15138,Love the print but runs way too small.,15138,1
15138,Did not return to get a bigger size cause as it is it took so long to be delivered!,15138,1
15139,So I love these sunglasses.,15139,1
15139,"I've bought them three times, I love them that much.",15139,1
15139,"But, I've had to buy them three times because they break.",15139,1
15139,The screw fell out of the frame and one of the arms fell off.,15139,1
15139,"On another pair, the lens fell out and wouldn't go back in.",15139,1
15139,I bought another pair.,15139,1
15139,"Within a month of buying the third pair, one of the nose pads fell off and I lost it.",15139,1
15139,"It happened about a week ago, but I waited two days too late to return them.",15139,1
15139,Super disappointed.,15139,1
15139,"$10 isn't much, but definitely not worth spending $10 on a pair of glasses that will break in less than a month.",15139,1
15140,This dress is attractive and it fit well when I put it on.,15140,1
15140,I wore it for about 5 hours for a party.,15140,1
15140,"As the evening progressed, the dress became larger.",15140,1
15140,"Yes, it stretched out on its own.",15140,1
15140,"After a couple of hours, I noticed that the shoulder areas had become loose and they would hang over my arms.",15140,1
15140,I had to be pulling them up very frequently.,15140,1
15140,"Then, the dress was no longer ""fit"" as it was becoming wider and, therefore, longer.",15140,1
15140,This has never happened with anything I've worn--it was almost comical (almost).,15140,1
15140,"Needless to say, it no longer fits me as it is now about 2-3 sizes bigger than what I wear.",15140,1
15140,"I took it to a seamstress and she can bring it down to size again; however, it will cost me $30--more than I paid for the dress.",15140,1
15140,Not worth it as it can likely happen again.,15140,1
15140,"So, it went to my donation corner in the garage.",15140,1
15141,These are inconsistently sized.,15141,1
15141,"The top is too tight, and the pants are too large.",15141,1
15141,My poor child looks like he's wearing a spandex shirt with Hammer pants!,15141,1
15141,"Unfortunately, he likes them too much for me to return them.",15141,1
15142,Way too small if you order this you need to go up a size or two,15142,1
15143,The photo really does not allow you to see what the item really is like in person.,15143,1
15143,I probably would not order from this brand again.,15143,1
15143,Was my 1st appointing Amazon experience.,15143,1

15152,Unrealistically small.,15152,1
15152,I wish I didn't waste my money!,15152,1
15153,"I was super excited about these, but they fell off so easily and when I tightened them they hurt my ears.",15153,1
15153,Both of them fell off and I lost them within a week of getting them.,15153,1
15153,"Nice concept, but functionality was terrible.",15153,1
15154,Did not fit.,15154,1

15157,"The bags material is so stiff it can't be used,

15157,I can't return it because time has run out.,15157,1
15157,I was going to by the purple one.,15157,1
15158,when you say 2x a full figure person thinks big,15158,1
15159,"Very nice, but too big for a small.",15159,1
15159,Looks like a large,15159,1
15160,This thing's a piece of junk.,15160,1

15160,Save your money.,15160,1
15161,Wallet had 3 cards in the entire thing and burst at the seams...,15161,1
15162,The sleeves of this top are far too narrow as compared to the rest of the garment.,15162,1
15162,The only way I could possibly wear it is to remove them and turn it into a sleeveless top which I will probably do.,15162,1
15162,"I would have returned it, but the price was so reasonable it wasn't worth the bother.",15162,1
15163,Cheap material but great if your going for the camel toe look - not my style but if it's your then this is for you,15163,1

15168,the cloth is terrible and it is cheap.,15168,1
15168,It does not look like it does on the picture...,15168,1
15169,Not even close to the size it's supposed to be.,15169,1

15175,Picture shows ribbon strap goes all around dress to look like purse.,15175,1
15175,"Description says top of Peppa's head is open, to be small pocket.",15175,1

15180,These fit however these look nothing like the picture.,15180,1
15180,The style is completely different.,15180,1

15182,It was very pretty but very small,15182,1
15183,Had to send it back.,15183,1
15183,The sleeves came down to my fingertips.,15183,1

15185,It's beautiful but the first time I wore it*t broke.,15185,1

15201,This is wayyyy to long!,15201,1
15201,It literally goes over my female parts and I have a regular size torso.,15201,1
15201,It's also very cheaply made compared to their other corsets.,15201,1
15201,"I was let down because I ordered two corsets from them, excellent quality.",15201,1
15201,But this one was the most expensive and it's the worst one.,15201,1

15203,Essentially a square piece of fabric with a hole in the neck.,15203,1
15204,The seams around the cuff came out pretty much the minute I touched the gloves.,15204,1
15204,"honestly though, that's not that annoying.",15204,1
15204,What I hate about these gloves is that I spent about $20 on them and the touch screen pads on the fingers stopped working after a few weeks.,15204,1
15204,Absolute waste of money.,15204,1
15204,"They're warm enough, for stylish gloves, but not for anything else, like touching snow or cold things.",15204,1
15204,"Also, just fyi, the pattern part isn't fabric, it's vinyl/plastic.",15204,1
15205,Didn't fit,15205,1
15206,I have one other of these purses and I love it.,15206,1
15206,I was really disappointed in this one because I ordered beige but it is more like a light yellow.,15206,1
15206,Would not have ordered it if I had known it wasn't a shade of brown.,15206,1
15206,Beige is a light brown color not yellow!!!!!!,15206,1

15210,"When I say this thing was a huge disappointment, I don't mean to imply that it is in anyway 'huge' or big or sized right.",15210,1
15210,It's the worst thing sold on Amazon - and that's not a stretch.,15210,1
15210,"And by stretch, I don't mean this sweater has stretch.",15210,1
15210,It's def a 'what the heck?',15210,1
15211,They look great but cheap thin Cotten material that won't last.,15211,1
15212,"I didn't get the color I want, it wasn't like what I see.",15212,1

15217,Turned my ears green.,15217,1
15217,I'm disappointed.,15217,1
15218,"This bracelet is not 7"" clasp to clasp.",15218,1
15218,"In addition, the cubes subtract from the circumference when it's on your wrist.",15218,1
15218,"This was a gift meant for someone who wears 7"" bracelets comfortably.",15218,1
15218,"However, because it only clears about 5.5"" comfortably on a wrist, I had to give it to someone with thin wrists.",15218,1
15218,This bracelet size in the product description was false and incredibly upsetting.,15218,1
15219,These leggings pants whatever you want to call them to me it was a piece of cloth that was way too small for the average woman.,15219,1
15219,The material was extremely cheap.,15219,1
15219,I threw this item in the trash the same day I received them,15219,1
15220,"Since I received metal stamping plates when I actually ordered a set of neckties I would have to say I was very disappointed in this product, it did NOT fit the description of the item ordered and I was very dissatisfied.",15220,1
15221,I ordered 3-6 months shoes but probably they will fit when 15 months.,15221,1
15221,The size it was not as expected.,15221,1
15221,Not excited about this product,15221,1
15222,very poor quality.,15222,1
15222,I guess that's what you get with this cost point.,15222,1
15223,Runs very small.,15223,1
15223,order up at least one size if not two.,15223,1
15224,One size certainly couldn't fit all.,15224,1
15225,Arrived with the logo stuck to itself which ruined it upon opening it up.,15225,1
15225,Plus the XL might fit an starving child in Africa.,15225,1
15225,"My hubby is a size Large (165 lbs/6 foot 2), and it looked like a tiny tee on him.",15225,1
15225,"I love the 80's, but the crop shirts can stay in the past.",15225,1
15226,"Product is a basic white T-shirt, looked nothing like the photo",15226,1
15227,Looks like you're wearing an apron.,15227,1
15228,"It's too big for my nipple the bar is big enough to be for a belly button per icing

15231,I purchased this slip in another color several months ago.,15231,1
15231,After reading other reviews I purchased it a size larger.,15231,1
15231,It was still a little snug so when I ordered it again in black I decided to order a size even larger.,15231,1
15231,"This one is even smaller than the first one I ordered and the material is stiffer, not as nice.",15231,1
15231,Because of the inconsistency of sizing and material I do not recommend buying from this company.,15231,1
15232,Hate it!,15232,1
15232,Horrible Knock-Off!,15232,1
15232,"This is nothing like the picture, it is a cheap iron-on decal, colors are faded and run together, the white outline is actually pink.",15232,1
15232,I am returning this and have learned valuable lesson - do not buy from Malay products.,15232,1
15233,too big,15233,1

15252,This product runs small.,15252,1

15261,She was wearing it less than 24 hours and it snapped in half.,15261,1
15261,Although aesthetically pleasing it is not worth any money at all for a broken ring.,15261,1

15263,Quality not great.,15263,1

15273,"Oddly fitting, cheap material not worth $14",15273,1
15274,Totally and  completely dissatisfied!,15274,1
15274,The socks do fit my large calves however after wearing a brand-new pair for less than an hour they were around my ankles they are already so loose that they will not stay above my ankles they are even sliding down into my shoe.,15274,1
15274,I tried a second pair hoping it was just a fluke no such luck second pair was just as bad as the first I will be throwing the remainder in the garbage where they belong,15274,1
15275,no where near true to size,15275,1
15276,I order a Lg.,15276,1
15276,And they look to be really small.,15276,1
15276,"I'm a size 8 , they looked like a 4.",15276,1
15276,Took about 3 weeks to get them.,15276,1
15277,Was definitely too big...,15277,1
15277,I don't understand how the model in the photo can wear it so well.,15277,1
15277,Veil literally covered my entire face all the way to the back of my neck!!,15277,1
15277,I didn't have time to buy a new one since this was used for my wedding day; I had to cut it myself and re-attach to the clips.,15277,1
15277,The clips are very thick and bulky and do not hold unless you throw in some bobby clips into your hair.,15277,1
15277,Very disappointed.,15277,1
15278,Fitting is really bad ..looks like one loose shirt,15278,1
15279,Very cheaply made doesn't fit right,15279,1
15280,Material was damaged.,15280,1
15280,Sent back,15280,1
15281,"Fit  really well, but the quality is so bad.",15281,1

15287,It looked cheap and is not sterling silver and turned my finger green in less than a day..,15287,1
15287,It also says it's sterling silver,15287,1
15288,Poor quality and very small,15288,1
15289,I purchased two of these.,15289,1
15289,One in black and the other in blue.,15289,1
15289,The black romper is significantly smaller despite ordering the same size.,15289,1
15289,The bottoms are also shaped differently.,15289,1
15289,The black romper bottom is almost a cheeky underwear shape while the blue romper is more full coverage/boy short-like.,15289,1
15289,They run small.,15289,1
15289,I bought an XL and I'm usually a medium or large.,15289,1
15289,My main fit problem was with the length.,15289,1
15289,I'm 5'7 and these rompers were just way too short for me.,15289,1
15290,"This was so small I couldn't get it past my calves, and I don't have big legs.",15290,1
15290,I think perhaps a child might fit these but certainly not an adult.,15290,1
15291,"It broke on the first day of use, which defeated the purpose.",15291,1
15292,"Is not loose fitting lke the picture, it is like a body con, spandex romber.",15292,1
15293,"Loved the why it looked just one problem, even after I washed it the color bleeds.",15293,1
15293,First day of wearing it i noticed my skin was dyed black  .,15293,1
15293,Still did it even after i washed it again,15293,1
15294,This product smelled awful when I opened the package.,15294,1
15294,I liked the fit so I washed it with detergent in warm water.,15294,1
15294,"Unfortunately, it still smells just as bad.",15294,1
15294,Smells like dead fish.,15294,1
15294,I can't determine what could be smelling like that unless it is simply the cheap fabric of which it is made.,15294,1
15295,"Way to short, I'm 5ft2 and 116 lbs and ordered a small.",15295,1
15295,It barely covers me...,15295,1
15296,Absolute garbage.....material too thin....totally wrinkled right out the dryer....not worth the money.,15296,1
15297,Too small and hangs badly.,15297,1
15298,The worse item .looks nothing like the picture a totally different dress.looks like a paper bag.i don't advice anyone to buy this .so disappointed,15298,1
15299,So cute.,15299,1
15299,But it's for a child,15299,1
15300,Don't waste your money - it's so sheer it's not even usable.,15300,1
15300,I'll have to put in a lining to even attempt to use it for my maternity clients.,15300,1
15300,"The fit is fine and the color is nice, but the fabric is not at all what I expected.",15300,1
15301,If you normally wear a Large or XL I would not get this product.,15301,1
15301,I normally buy L or XL due to my arms and bust.,15301,1
15301,It was SO tight it fit like a small.,15301,1
15301,I would never order from this company again if they can't get there size chart correct.,15301,1
15301,This worst part is just to return it is more than the stupid shirt.,15301,1
15302,This ring is stunning.. but runs sooooooo small.. i wear a 7.. so i ordered size 7.. it so small.. doesnt even fit my pinky.,15302,1
15303,Too small and bad material.,15303,1
15303,"I typically buy an ""M"", but bought an ""L""...should have gotten an ""XL"".",15303,1
15303,"I am 5'9"" and 135 lbs (size 4-6) Would not recommend this shirt.",15303,1
15304,"It's ok, but the material is cheap.",15304,1
15305,The outfit must have been missized this was the smallest 2x I have ever seen... Plan on returning it,15305,1
15306,the hat is overpriced for its quality.,15306,1
15307,Fabric was extremely thin.,15307,1
15307,The sizing is way off.,15307,1
15307,I ordered an XL and it is more like an XS.,15307,1
15308,"The legs are  straight cylinders, meaning the thigh is they same diameter as the calf and ankle.",15308,1
15308,This makes for loose and baggy ankles and a terrible fit for medical and small boned ladies.,15308,1
15308,I returned them immediately.,15308,1
15309,This was really a waste of money.,15309,1
15309,"Bought two of them, one for my daughter and one for her friend.",15309,1
15309,The product is really cheaply made and it shows.,15309,1
15309,Neither girl ended up wearing it in public.,15309,1
15309,No big deal since it's an inexpensive item but I wouldn't recommend it.,15309,1
15310,jacket is too tight for my son across his back.,15310,1
15310,his normal size is xl but i ordered xxl to be sure and he is still unable to wear it,15310,1

15313,It doesn't worth a penny!,15313,1
15314,This item is not as pictured.,15314,1
15314,I ordered the burgundy and received and ugly red trying to be passed off as that color.,15314,1
15314,"The sleeves are not sleeves at all, just drapes over your arm.",15314,1
15314,I am not pleased at all and would NOT recommend this item.,15314,1
15314,The only way I could submit my review is to rate this product I'm giving it 1 star but it's not worth that,15314,1
15315,I wish I could give this product 0 stars.,15315,1
15315,I went up two sizes because of other reviews....,15315,1
15315,This still did not even come close to fitting.,15315,1
15315,I threw it in the trash.,15315,1
15315,Invest in something with a little more quality.,15315,1
15316,"The front pouch is really small,uncomfortable feeling,is like for small packages.",15316,1
15317,TOO BAD IT RUNS SO SMALL.,15317,1
15318,This is not a regular trucker hat.,15318,1
15318,The bill is like an inch long.,15318,1
15318,"I thought that maybe the picture of the hat was off, but it's not.",15318,1
15319,These I say are plastic!,15319,1
15319,Why do I say this?,15319,1
15319,Because some of the color came off.,15319,1
15320,"Product arrived in undamaged packaging (as in, the carrier didn't destroy it) but with the folded frame having torn through the extremely cheap fabric around both hinges.",15320,1
15320,Tried it on anyway.,15320,1
15320,"Inside material was otherwise rough and uncomfortable against my skin, headband refused to bend well enough to fit my head, and the frame pressed uncomfortably against my ears the entire time I spent wearing it, no matter what adjustments I made to its angle across my neck.",15320,1
15320,Outside material was passable at best.,15320,1
15320,"Earmuffs had no actual insulation in them, and were basically just two layers of fabric stitched over a plastic frame with a sort of stiffener sandwiched in between.",15320,1
15320,"Not worth the cost in time or money to return it, no desire to get a replacement.",15320,1
15320,Don't waste your time.,15320,1

15324,Stay away!!!!,15324,1
15324,I should have known the price was too good to be true.,15324,1
15324,It is just not easy to find a big sized leather belt on Amazon.,15324,1
15325,I hated this material it did nothing for me it made me a look sloppy,15325,1
15326,I only received 1 Sandle not 2,15326,1

15337,Please don't buy this if you are plus size.,15337,1
15337,Otherwise good.,15337,1
15337,The size 24-26 would be equivalent to may be 16/18,15337,1
15338,Totally rip off,15338,1
15339,Beware that this product is only the material needed to stitch a dress such as that shown.,15339,1
15339,The material is of low quality as you would expect for such a low price.,15339,1
15339,The picture does not adequately reflect the poor quality of the material.,15339,1

15342,Fake leather!!!,15342,1
15342,It comes with a coat of heavy oil with unpleasant odor.,15342,1
15342,The purpose is to prevent anyone trying to do a smell test.,15342,1
15342,"But if you look carefully, you will find repeated patterns on the leather grain.",15342,1
15342,"In my case, I identified a specific marking and found three locations on the handbag with identical markings.",15342,1
15342,"Evidently, the leather look-alike material comes out of a drum press that creates repeated patterns.",15342,1

15352,just a Piece of cloth that is terribly sewn with tiny puffs added on the edge?,15352,1
15352,The puffs are like 1 cm in diameter ( I did exaggerate a little bit ) Also I wear a size xs and this was too small on me.,15352,1
15352,this is supposed to be OVERSIZED and LOOSE not tight like a crop top.,15352,1
15353,I would have had to be 4' tall with no chest for it to have fit.,15353,1
15353,Upon opening the package 4 bugs fell out and when trying it on I developed a rash.,15353,1
15354,Very small size should order 2 size bigger,15354,1

15361,TERRIBLE QUALITY AND SIZE AND SO THIN YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE MATERIAL,15361,1
15362,The only good thing about this is the price.,15362,1
15362,I'm convinced that it is not made for a woman...let alone a pregnant one.,15362,1
15362,I got 2 sized up from what I am but the proportions are all funky and stick figure-esk.,15362,1
15363,"I guess ""Breathable"" means completely sheer, thinner than fishnet fabric.",15363,1
15363,also the description doesn't mention a thing about it being glittery.,15363,1
15363,Don't know if it fits because I didn't bother trying them on.,15363,1
15363,Throwing them out after I post this as it's not even worth the Return costs.,15363,1

15364,"Very cheap, all shirts wear oddly...some too short, some too tight on top others on bottom, some even cut at an angle or sewn crooked!",15364,1

15367,The ruching on the chest was uneven (some substantially wider than others) and stuck out away from my chest.,15367,1
15367,The shoulder straps were wider than in picture.,15367,1

15367,"The dress zipped up, but was not flattering at all.",15367,1
15367,"I order many dresses online and am pretty good at assessing my measurement, I even ordered up a size in this dress.",15367,1
15367,"IMHO, I feel the dress in the picture is not the ""knock off"" I received.",15367,1
15367,"Unfortunately, my event was only 2 days after my dress arrived, so I went with a dress I already owned.",15367,1
15367,"On the plus side, now my kids have made a game of finding all the stray sequins in the house.....weeks after the dress was unveiled.",15367,1

15372,Really to bad because I would have loved it to fit.,15372,1

15373,Think twice before you buy.,15373,1

15378,"The length between the shoulders and crotch is definitely off, because my butt was half-way out the bottom despite it being pulled down as much as possible.",15378,1
15378,"On top of that, I could barely get the romper over my hips to put it on, and the material is COMPLETELY see through even with nude undergarments... My one true romper is out there, but this wasn't it.",15378,1
15379,The dress looks totally different than the picture.,15379,1
15379,And I am guessing it was sized for a toddler.,15379,1
15380,This necklace is suuuuuper skinny and I can bend it with my fingers.,15380,1

15402,"I'm just going to return these and order a different pair, you'd think they'd all be the same right?",15402,1
15402,Why would someone want cat gloves that don't really fit non-child hands (though you could chalk it up to needing to be broken in) nor have places to leave your fingers?,15402,1
15402,May be okay for a cosplay for a slightly smaller person but not being able to have a place to have your fingers is a bit lame.,15402,1
15403,The belt is smaller than I expected...bought a Medium size belt for my boyfriend as a surprise because he hardly has time to look/buy a new belt and the one he still uses is falling apart and won't hold his pants up.,15403,1

15412,To me it did not look like the picture.,15412,1
15412,I was unable to send it back cost 34$ to send back that's more than the sweater was.,15412,1
15413,The sizing was all wrong on this dress.,15413,1
15414,It was like a child's sweater and it had a big hole in it.,15414,1
15415,"The color is not the same, the sizing is off (maybe I just don't understand Asian sizes, I don't know), totally see through and very cheaply made.",15415,1

15429,Very cheap looking,15429,1
15430,The printing on these pants was very poor and misaligned.,15430,1

15430,There is a card in the package from HDE that has a customer service number.,15430,1
15430,They are worthless... all they want to do is collect defects so they can improve their own business.,15430,1

15458,The display is nothing to what the product really looks like in fact the fabric is so thing it is almost see through.,15458,1
15458,Was a terrible gift.,15458,1
15459,Wasn't the right size and it came with the bars falling out.,15459,1
15459,It was in bad shape and delivery date was off.,15459,1
15460,Super small,15460,1
15461,It broke soon after I bought it,15461,1
15462,"Looked beautiful on site, but when i received the necklace I was disappointed,  The front stones were surrounded by clear stones; which were beautiful and the metal was shiny.",15462,1
15462,"But as the stones went towards your neck, the surrounding stones around the large stones became dark and the metal was dark.",15462,1
15462,The contrasting metals and stones made it look like two different necklaces.,15462,1
15462,"If the necklace looked the same for the entire length, I would of kept, but he change of metals and colors of stones (surrounding) were distracting and took away from what could of been a beautiful necklace.",15462,1
15462,Upset that the necklace did not turn out what was shown on internet.,15462,1
15462,"My husband said when worn with a dress with hair up, will look ridiculous.",15462,1
15462,"That was the  game changer, when a man sees the difference of metal in a necklace, pretty bad.",15462,1
15463,"It was inexpensive, and I got what I paid for.",15463,1
15463,The chain came apart several times within one week of wearing.,15463,1
15463,I was able to reattach the remaining chain three times.,15463,1
15463,The last time it just came apart and was not recoverable/fixable.,15463,1
15463,"The velvet was soft and it looked great on my GF, so it is a shame.",15463,1
15463,I would pay a few more bucks for a better quality fastener and chain.,15463,1
15464,Be forewarned.,15464,1
15464,"As a number of reviews have detailed, I too have a faulty watch winder that is now no better than a display case.",15464,1
15464,"At least I paid $139 last year, while I see the price has increased to $199.",15464,1
15464,"For this current price, I would say this is not worth the risk.",15464,1
15464,"Having only had it for 8 months, I attempted to contact this Seller (Watch Winder Boxes) and they deferred me to the manufacturer's site.",15464,1
15464,Must be nice to be able to collect customer's money and then not have to lift a finger when something goes wrong.,15464,1
15464,Maybe WWB should rethink selling this questionable product.,15464,1
15464,"I feel like Belocia has been misleading shoppers by listing ""Japanese Mabuchi Motor"" in the description.",15464,1
15464,"Sure, the motor is probably Japanese.",15464,1
15464,"But the entire unit is most likely manufactured and assembled in China, meaning it's construction and quality are suspect, as usual.",15464,1
15464,So proceed with caution.,15464,1
15464,"If you do not have the disposable income for a $200 display case, this one is a risky choice.",15464,1
15465,Did not get the right size it was way too small for me don't know if this was just a mistake or its just the actual size that might come smaller anyways would not buy again form here but the emblem does indeed look good but if you thinking of letting someone hold it they will definitely know it's a knock off.,15465,1
15466,My baby was in her cot and I could hear choking noises.,15466,1
15466,knowing there is nothing in her cot that could cause that I picked her up and she threw up everywhere and out came a lace from her sock.,15466,1
15466,These are a choking hazard and they started piling within the first 5 hours wear.,15466,1
15466,They are cute but not worth my babies life.,15466,1
15467,"It was broken when I received it , I'm so disappointed",15467,1
15468,Uncomfortable.,15468,1
15469,I was so excite about these bc they were so cute.,15469,1
15469,I carry them in my scrub pockets and use at work.,15469,1
15469,I noticed they didn't cut that well through kerlix/gauze then they just completely came apart into 2 pieces from hinge!,15469,1
15469,I was so mad I paid for better quality with a pair from dollar store.,15469,1
15469,Can't believe they fell apart after less than a month!,15469,1
15469,I'm a nurse and actually needed these for work.,15469,1
15470,"You do not get what is in the picture, I bought this for a star themed party so it kind of sucked to open the box and not be given the product I paid for.",15470,1
15471,Loss of money!,15471,1
15472,"The design of the outfit is well made, but the size was 2 times my size.",15472,1
15472,I used the size chart and ordered accordingly.,15472,1
15472,I returned the item and reordered 2 sizes smaller.,15472,1
15472,My original size ordered was a 14 but upon return I ordered a size 10.,15472,1
15473,"The lace part is pretty but the neck is weird.. not a low cut like i thought,  almost like a turtle neck..",15473,1
15474,It made me look like a marshmallow and then they gave me the run around when I tried to return it.,15474,1
15474,Waste of time and money,15474,1
15475,Don't waste your time buying this bag.,15475,1
15475,It came smelling like an oil can (the smell gagged me) and the clasp on the strap was broken.,15475,1
15475,I've contacted seller and they are wanting to send me another one even after I told them three times I want a refund.,15475,1
15475,I'm afraid I'll be eating the cost of this.,15475,1
15476,color is not good..stitching not good,15476,1
15477,I purchased this shirt in a medium and its too small.,15477,1
15477,The image on the shirt looks different than received.,15477,1
15477,My shirt looks blurry and made cheaply.,15477,1
15478,Way too small.,15478,1
15478,"I orginally wear either a 12 or 14 in woman, and it's not true, one size fit all.",15478,1
15478,It waa to tight.,15478,1
15479,Size is correct but product comes from china... too small for an adult.,15479,1
15479,more for a child.,15479,1
15480,Says one size fits all.,15480,1
15480,No way.,15480,1
15480,My wife is a small and this thing had to be returned.,15480,1
15480,It MAY be okay for small kids or super model people that don't eat and weigh 80 pounds.,15480,1
15481,it's rather flimsy and the zipper broke already,15481,1
15482,"I know the description said ""hot pink"", but these are like a neon fuschia.",15482,1
15482,Gawdy!,15482,1
15482,It's not worth sending back so they're going to Goodwill.,15482,1
15482,Or maybe I'll keep them to wear to a tacky Christmas sweater party.,15482,1
15483,"Looks like a tent, the v neck is above the collar bone so there is nothing cute about this shirt",15483,1
15484,I bought this purse because I thought it looked really cute..,15484,1
15484,When I got it..omg.,15484,1
15484,I was actually really mad and confused (I wish I had taken pictures!,15484,1
15484,But I have attached a photo of what it looked the purse looked like when I got it.),15484,1
15484,But the purse came in my mailbox..and my mailbox is TINY which means that the purse was shoved in a small regular mail (the one you use for books) envelope.,15484,1
15484,"When I took the purse out, it was wrinkled and not at all what I had expected.",15484,1
15484,"Trust me, it looks the price.",15484,1
15484,To take care of the wrinkles in the purse I have shoved socks in there to capacity for two weeks now.,15484,1
15484,I have no used it yet and I actually might just give it away.,15484,1
15484,"I would much rather spend $100 for a purse and have it look right, feel right, and look like it's worth $500 than a purse that I spent $12 and it looks like $12.",15484,1
15484,More details: The strap feels really thin and feels as though it will break soon..,15484,1
15484,"Although the purse is a good size, the opening is a lot smaller than I had expected and would like.",15484,1
15484,The inside of the purse is the worst part.,15484,1
15484,It actually feels like plastic or paper.,15484,1
15484,I suggest you take your money elsewhere because this product is honestly not worth it.,15484,1
15485,INVITATION FOR RAPE.,15485,1
15485,Doesn't cover anything the tan color you see it's your body.,15485,1
15485,It more works as a swim suit cover than as a dress.,15485,1
15486,poor quality,15486,1
15487,The too was too too small and the bottom was too big just wasn't what the picture showed no way this is plus size ..,15487,1
15488,Small small,15488,1
15489,Wish they got the size right it was a really cute romper,15489,1
15490,Broke within a week,15490,1
15491,"Such a bummer, it is WAY to small.. :(",15491,1
15492,I bought these for a boy.,15492,1
15492,They have a lace edging.,15492,1
15492,"And, unfortunatlet, I missed my window for returning them to amazon.",15492,1
15492,"The quality is not the same as the gerber or Gymboree anti skid socks I have, these are way thinner.",15492,1
15492,"Honestly, they are like thin girls fashion socks.",15492,1
15492,You don't find boys socks made of this thin material.,15492,1
15492,"And how nice, they included a pink bracelet for my baby boy with it, yeah....  Cheap Chinese stuff like you'd find at a flea market, not worth the price.",15492,1
15492,"I think they are also bigger than a 9 month old would wear, these look like maybe a 2-3 year old girl size to me.",15492,1
15493,Product looked nice and as described but way too small!,15493,1
15493,Ordered the largest sizes and they came and were more along the lines of a US xs/s.,15493,1
15493,They were difficult to get back to me regarding a return and now they have been returned and delivered and they will not process my return or give a refund.,15493,1
15493,Proceed with caution.,15493,1
15494,I've literally since thrown away all of these socks.,15494,1
15494,They were way to small and all have since ripped,15494,1
15495,Material is similar to a shower curtain.,15495,1
15495,Very disappointing.,15495,1
15496,Doesn't really wroth like the picture shown.,15496,1
15497,The image was rad.,15497,1
15497,However the cut of the shirt was extremely short.,15497,1
15497,Like a baby tee.,15497,1
15497,Tried contacting seller no response.,15497,1
15497,Good luck with your purchase.,15497,1
15498,This shirts decal faded and looked just awful after just one washing.,15498,1
15499,This product does not fit my LG G4 at all.,15499,1
15499,Please do not waste your money by buying this.,15499,1
15499,It does not fit!,15499,1
15499,I am literally holding my phone in my hand now because it keeps falling off from the case.,15499,1
15500,Fits really weird on me .... And it smelled really bad when I got it.,15500,1
15501,"very stretchy material, it light weight, but needs an interior tie to keep closed.",15501,1
15501,Sleeves long and really tight.,15501,1
15501,wanted a nice light weight robe that could wear when warm... this was not it.,15501,1
15502,NO LONGER SERVE YOU earrings and CALLUS A STONE BEFORE USING THE COLLAR,15502,1
15503,Very cheap stuff.,15503,1
15503,From look to feel.,15503,1
15503,Will not buy again.,15503,1
15503,Actually I donated this shirt to charity already.,15503,1
15504,The color is way lighter than the one on the pic..  And the bottom half is too tight the size run a little small if you have cruves.,15504,1
15504,(a big butt),15504,1
15505,Nothing about this product performs as advertised.,15505,1
15505,Really disappointed.,15505,1
15505,Would not even wear these as regular undies.,15505,1
15505,I tried them 12 weeks post c-section.,15505,1
15506,"Sizing was way too LARGE, but the quality is good",15506,1
15507,"I loved how this dress looked so much, that I didn't mind that I had to order two sizes up to find one that fit.",15507,1
15507,"However, the day I wore it, I had found that the dress had begun to fall apart.",15507,1
15507,"The armpits are completely ripped out (first two photos), there's a hole at the seam on the back of the shoulder (third photo), and a rip in the seam of the skirt (last photo).",15507,1
15507,I was not at all active while wearing the dress and it was not too tight.,15507,1
15507,"Unfortunately I can't find a link to contact the seller and file a complaint, so instead I am forced to leave a negative review.",15507,1
15507,"I wish it had been better quality, as literally everyone I had encountered complemented the dress.",15507,1
15508,The shirt doesn't criss cross its sucks,15508,1
15509,not good,15509,1
15510,Save your money ..its garbage.,15510,1
15511,I used it as a septum piercing and the bar somehow clicked and then went under leaving me with an hour to try to bring it back up and take it off.,15511,1
15511,Not to mention bleeding from me irritating the heck out of my nose.,15511,1
15511,So disappointed.,15511,1
15512,Material is very flimsy.,15512,1
15512,Larger than expected.,15512,1
15513,was not what I was expecting.,15513,1
15513,Beautiful color however the material and the dress itself did not look like the pic at all.,15513,1
15514,Looks totally different than the picture.,15514,1
15514,You can barely see the logo.,15514,1
15515,My son goes through a new pair of shoes every six months.,15515,1
15515,"We had been buying the cheapest we could find for this reason,  but had a bad experience with the last pair this last time we bought these.",15515,1
15515,I went with dc because I know them to be a high quality brand.,15515,1
15515,Not this time.,15515,1
15515,The normal wear and tear stuff has held up nicely but the eyelet that the shoe laces go through have all fell out and because there's only a hole in fabric they are ripping.,15515,1
15515,Im super disappointed as we got these on Dec  and it is just the beginning of Feb and we are already close to another pair of tennis shoes having to be bought.,15515,1
15515,"And there is no contact seller option since it's been delivered,  and since I bought on amazon I can't contact dc directly.",15515,1
15515,Overall just a huge disappointment.,15515,1
15516,Did not fit at all,15516,1
15517,"Runs extremely small, and very cheaply made.",15517,1
15517,The material is see through.,15517,1
15517,Would not recommend to anyone,15517,1
15518,Way WAY too small.,15518,1
15518,Ordered a 2X and it was more like a medium.,15518,1
15518,"I gave it one star not because I didn't like the shirt, but because I can't wear it because it isn't even close to fitting as expected.",15518,1
15519,I wore these twice.,15519,1
15519,The second day one of the clasps stopped working and would repeatedly pop off,15519,1
15520,Didn't even get to try it on before it broke on me!,15520,1
15520,Cheap.,15520,1
15521,Not leather as listed.,15521,1
15521,Poor quality and probably a knock-off.,15521,1
15522,It did come at all,15522,1
15523,"I did not like it at all, it didn't look as in pic.",15523,1
15523,The fabric it was poor and too thin .,15523,1
15523,I'm just too disappointed,15523,1
15524,don't like,15524,1
15525,I ordered these pants from the womens department and it stated that they were a size 3x I had to give them to my daughter who wears a size 8 normally I don't know where their sizing came from but it certainly was not 03 X or even close to it  thank goodness I have a good sense of humor because I really got a chuckle out of this one maybe it was because it was the  holiday season,15525,1
15526,Not only is this poor quality shirt to small the material is polyester.,15526,1
15526,I can't tolerate polyester - it's too HOT.,15526,1
15526,I thought it was cotton.,15526,1
15526,I'd return it but it will more than likely cost more to return it than what I paid for the darn thing.,15526,1
15526,I hate it and I hate that it's made in China.,15526,1
15526,You also didn't send an invoice.,15526,1
15526,Waist of my money and my time,15526,1
15527,Cheap puppy quality,15527,1
15528,"I ordered up a size per the reviews, I should have ordered two sizes up.",15528,1
15529,Super cute hat but quality is terrible.,15529,1
15529,Came in the mail on Thursday and within three uses both of the buttons have fallen off.,15529,1
15529,Very disappointed,15529,1
15530,"I love the design of the shirt, but it runs WAY TOO SMALL.",15530,1
15530,"Not sure if this was made in another country where 4XL people are little, but it was WAY too small.",15530,1
15530,The 4XL fit me like a 2XL.,15530,1
15530,Can't wear that in public.,15530,1
15531,Threw it away.would fit a doll,15531,1
15532,I'd select ZERO stars if I could!!,15532,1
15532,I ordered these for the cold St. Louis winter and was really excited when they arrived.,15532,1
15532,"I ordered the 1X because I'm about 5'8"" and have junk in the trunk if you will.",15532,1
15532,I pulled them out and they were very soft and looked to be perfect for my body.,15532,1
15532,I went to put them on and the waist literally stopped barely mid thigh.,15532,1
15532,"The package said for women up to 6 foot tall and well frankly, you have to be more like 4 foot tall for them to fit.",15532,1
15532,It would fit a child in the length.,15532,1
15532,I had to return both pairs I ordered.,15532,1
15532,I do not recommend these to anyone who reaches the height limit for a roller coaster at your local amusement park!,15532,1
15533,"I rarely, rarely give 1 star reviews.",15533,1
15533,"I usually try to find at least a few positive aspects about a product so that I can give it as good a review as possible, but this top?",15533,1
15533,No.,15533,1
15533,It's awful.,15533,1
15533,"I'm sorry, top.",15533,1
15533,I am!,15533,1
15533,You look so cute in the photo.,15533,1
15533,"I wanted to love you, but no.",15533,1
15533,I'm sorry.,15533,1
15533,I can't.,15533,1
15533,"This top is thread-bare, so, so small, and the elastic around the shoulders is all twisted and weird!",15533,1
15533,"I was super surprised at how small the top was, since I ordered two sizes up as usual for asian sizes.",15533,1
15533,It's still just super tiny.,15533,1
15533,"The elastic on top won't even go around my shoulders, and I'm not a broad shouldered gal.",15533,1
15533,"I will be returning this top, sadly.",15533,1
15533,Hopefully I just got a bad one!,15533,1
15534,I bought an XL and it fit MY EIGHT YEAR OLD!!!,15534,1
15534,"And no means is she thick, for that matter, neither am I!",15534,1
15534,"""Runs small"" is an understatement!",15534,1
15535,Awful.,15535,1
15535,Not even close to matching the size chart and looks/feels even cheaper than it actually was.,15535,1
15535,!,15535,1
15536,OKAY,15536,1
15537,These pants are tiny!,15537,1
15537,An 8-10 year old child might be able to eat these.,15537,1
15538,Was and still so disappointed of the quality and the size of this dress.,15538,1
15539,It's a good thing this is a gift for a 7 year old because the product is extremely cheap.,15539,1
15539,"Seeing as how I paid less than $20 for it, I certainly got what I paid for: a cheap dollar store product.",15539,1
15540,This bag is made of a really cheap material.,15540,1
15540,"My package arrived wet, so the backpack was soaked and had yellow stains.",15540,1
15540,The seller told me to wash it instead of offering me a full refund.,15540,1
15540,I'm really disappointed with the purchase.,15540,1
15541,"Heavy, cheaply made.",15541,1
15541,One was broke when I received them.,15541,1
15541,Good for nothing but looking at.,15541,1
15542,I wish there were 0 stars.,15542,1
15542,This is so small I couldn't get my neck thru the opening.,15542,1
15542,"It's super sheer, and arrived with a broken zipper.",15542,1
15543,Looks like a cheap Halloween costume,15543,1
15544,super tight and small... my daughter is 9 months  in the 85 percentile for weight so I sized up.,15544,1
15544,The 18 month size is tight on her - in other brands she wears 9 and 12 months comfortably.,15544,1
15545,They are way to big and you can only wear them with a rubber band on them.,15545,1
15546,Fabric really stiff and poorly made.,15546,1
15547,"No ring, only the box came.",15547,1
15548,I like ot but didn't fit it runs very smal,15548,1
15549,The fastener on this clip charm was cheaply made.,15549,1
15549,It would seem to be closed and then it would just open randomly and the charm would fall off the bracelet!,15549,1
15549,This happened a few times in the couple days that I had it and then of course it happened and the charm was lost!,15549,1
15549,Big waste of money.,15549,1
15549,I think I should get a refund.,15549,1
15550,Much to small for my glasses.,15550,1
15551,The gauge was WAY TOO BIG.,15551,1

15672,It's not even.,15672,1
15673,I bought these for my twin 2yo girls thinking they would be perfect for their first day at the beach.,15673,1
15673,"They looked good, got good reviews and were really affordable at only $10 a pair.",15673,1

15673,See attached pictures.,15673,1
15673,"Now, 3 days later, the girls can't wear socks because the blisters are too painful
I'm incredibly surprised that a company would create such an inferior quality product for a child.",15673,1

15683,The top was very very small,15683,1
15684,Tiny stones around the edge of large purple stone began falling out the first day.,15684,1

15780,"The material is nice, and it appeared well made.",15780,1
15780,"When I put it on, I was disappointed to discover that one side appeared longer than the other.",15780,1
15780,I was hoping I was wrong.,15780,1
15780,I pulled out the measuring tape and verified that one side is a full inch longer.,15780,1
15780,I also noticed that the sleeves were off as well.,15780,1
15780,I will be sending it back.,15780,1

15784,It's completely see-through so requires an undershirt or tank.,15784,1
15784,The quality was also disappointing.,15784,1

15793,"Poor quality, returning.",15793,1
15793,The item I received probably didn't dry completely before being packaged.,15793,1
15793,Color is dripping from area it was intended to be and is visible on gold around those triangles.,15793,1
15794,Poorly made-I threw them away immediately.,15794,1
15795,Used this watch for a short while then a screw inside starts tossing around and jams up the works.,15795,1

15798,Not at all like the photo.,15798,1
15798,It's going back.,15798,1
15799,Size and style of the one I ordered was way off.,15799,1
15799,I typically wear a medium but ordered extra large.,15799,1
15799,"If the item is supposed to fit as pictured, I would have needed it to be literally twice the size of what I received - which is a tight crew neck tank that came to the top of my hip bone.",15799,1
15799,Not the flowy scoop neck on the model.,15799,1
15799,"Bow in back was about half the size pictured, pinned to the center of a typical tank top.",15799,1

15803,I threw it in the garbage.,15803,1
15804,I was totally unhappy with this purchase.,15804,1
15804,The inner piece was a cheap swimsuit shaped bodysuit and not a full bottom short pant cat suit like in the picture as advertised.,15804,1
15804,I was totally mislead by the picture online.,15804,1
15804,To add insult to injury had the bodysuit been made from a quality spandex I might have been able to salvage the purchase but since it was made from some sort of inferior polyester blend I would not be able to use this outfit at all.,15804,1
15804,Amazon should find a way to ensure that its suppliers are not ripping off their customers.,15804,1
15805,If you are a large man looking for a large or xxl tank top do not buy this product.,15805,1

15818,"This ""dress"" is a joke.",15818,1
15818,It's a poorly made sack.,15818,1
15818,There is so much material at the top of the dress it literally looks like a plastic garbage bag.,15818,1
15818,"If you rip out the lining and gave it to Wendy, the talk show host, there would still be room.",15818,1

15873,I noticed immediately the stitching was becoming loose and the zipper became rusty and doesn't work due to the cold.,15873,1
15873,I mean the jacket did cost $50 what can you really expect?.,15873,1
15873,But I do not recommend purchasing the coat,15873,1

15888,And of course the seller won't let you return it; instead giving you the run around in emails.,15888,1
15889,I loved these pants until I washed them once and they now have a huge hole in the waist where all the stitching came out.,15889,1
15889,This is extremely poor quality for this to happen especially after just one wash.,15889,1
15890,These should be market as jr plus.,15890,1
15890,I had to give them away.,15890,1
15890,It was not feasible to return to China.,15890,1
15890,Will never purchase these type items again.,15890,1
15891,they are child sized ... terrible purchase they are short and fit tight ...,15891,1
15891,I'll give them to my 5 year old  niece,15891,1
15892,The colors look nothing like the pictures and it ran huge.,15892,1
15893,I am 5ft 7inches 125 pounds and don't have large thighs but these are way to small and tight unless you want knee high instead of thigh high......it is made for  very very small women like 90 pounds.,15893,1
15894,This bag lasted 1 day before the strap broke.,15894,1
15894,The space where the loop hooks tot he purse is also coming out already.,15894,1
15894,It is a nice looking purse and I was pretty pleased when I opened the box but not if it's going to break that quickly!,15894,1
15894,It is cheap enough that I wasn't expecting perfection but I was certainly expecting it to be able to handle regular use.,15894,1
15895,Terrible quality,15895,1
15896,HORRIBLE.,15896,1
15896,"The zipper definitely doesn't work, the stitching is already loose/coming out.",15896,1
15896,Not worth it.,15896,1
15897,Horrible product.,15897,1
15897,The material is beyond cheap.,15897,1
15898,Ordered the green galaxy design and it shipped quickly.,15898,1
15898,Was planning on wearing it for my trip abroad.,15898,1
15898,"First problem - the design was not what I ordered, instead I got some aurora boreales design.",15898,1
15898,Second problem - size was super misleading.,15898,1
15898,"I'm 5'6"" about 130lbs and the length of the torso was too short, creating a wedgie.",15898,1
15898,"The arm length was good, color okay for being the wrong one, but was uncomfortable and disappointing.",15898,1
15898,"For fear of seams ripping in the future, I am returning a.s.a.p.",15898,1
15899,"I really liked these jeans, I'm usually always a 32 but I thought they might run small so I ordered them in a 33 in another color.",15899,1
15899,However the 33 is so loose the waist clasp won't stay done.,15899,1
15899,"I still liked the jeans so I ordered them again (these jeans) in a different shade in a 32 and was looking forward to a nice fit...Nope, the 32 is so small I can't even wear them!",15899,1
15899,the 32's are like a 30 and the 33's are like a 36.,15899,1
15899,I don't know haw anyone can find the right size unless maybe you just order a random size and have amazing luck.,15899,1
15900,It wasn't at all what the product claimed.,15900,1
15900,It had American flag print on the lenses.,15900,1
15901,Fits extremely tight and very cheaply made strings hanging and this material.,15901,1
15902,Poor quality,15902,1
15903,Hot to wear,15903,1
15904,After years of being a prime member this is by far the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.,15904,1
15904,The suit is completely see through and the fabric is beyond uncomfortable.,15904,1
15904,Borat wouldn't even wear this.,15904,1
15904,I'm disappointed that Amazon stands behind such a low quality product.,15904,1
15904,I feel like I got fooled out of my money.,15904,1
15905,"Much too small, for a very small person",15905,1

15911,"Love the look and the size, but the handles are sure to break quickly, unfortunately.",15911,1
15911,"Would be a perfect beach bag of large towels, etc.",15911,1
15911,Even comes with a cute smaller zippered pouch on the inside (although no inside pockets).,15911,1
15912,Cheap material .,15912,1
15912,Color was as shown.,15912,1
15912,It's short and wide so if your trying to get the camel toe look then buy it .,15912,1
15912,I was not going for that look so complete waste of money,15912,1
15913,It's too small,15913,1
15914,Totally fake.,15914,1
15914,I ordered a large because I'm a medium and it fit like am extra small!,15914,1
15914,"The sleeves came to my elbows , now I'm only 5'3 so you can say this totally was a rip off.",15914,1
15914,The material was light and felt like my toddler could rip it.,15914,1
15914,Terrible.,15914,1
15914,Its cute looking.,15914,1
15914,But can't fit me.,15914,1

the panty line will definitely show !",15926,1
15926,sort of regret getting it,15926,1
15927,"The medium was too small, the large was too big, and I usually wear a US small in one piece bathing suits.",15927,1
15927,Tell me how that makes sense?!,15927,1
15927,In addition the top is way too wide no matter the size and the material is cheap.,15927,1

15934,The material is nice and very soft but the fit is awful.,15934,1
15934,If you are larger than a size 2 it will NOT be flattering whatsoever.,15934,1
15934,The biggest issue in my opinion is the sleeves.,15934,1

15936,Took extremely long to arrive and when it got here it was nothing like the picture.,15936,1
15936,The color was a puke green and the material was polyester and more like a Halloween costume!,15936,1
15936,I was so disappointed.,15936,1
15937,When you get it in the mail and give it to your wife it does not look like it did in the picture and it's a really cheap looking coat in real life and the buttons on it fall off very easily and they also did not look like the ones in the add,15937,1

15943,It was like putting on a trash bag and adding a tie wrap to it.,15943,1
15943,"I have curves and boobs, not like the model.",15943,1
15943,I think my body changed the way the dress should have fallen.,15943,1

15945,Wife did not like these at all.,15945,1

15947,I was so disappointed when I got this after waiting a month for it to come in the mail.,15947,1
15947,"The material is thin and itchy, the fit does not feel professionally made at all, and the majority of it is open seam.",15947,1
15947,"I know if I ever washed it, the whole shirt would just curl up.",15947,1
15947,It looks more like a DIY project than a shirt I would ever pay money for.,15947,1
15947,"When I tried to return it, I got an email back saying they would refund me 20% if I kept it and asked if I could possibly just gift it to someone else.",15947,1
15947,So now I feel guilt tripped into keeping it!,15947,1
15948,Cheap and tiny.,15948,1
15949,Heavy material that is scratching my skin not even worth the few dollars cost.,15949,1

15952,.,15952,1
15952,Very sad.,15952,1

15959,The first thing I noticed was that it was not stamped.,15959,1
15959,"That concerned me but hey, It was pretty so I wore it a lot for around 2 weeks.",15959,1
15959,After that time it started turning a copper color.,15959,1
15959,"Not the normal tarnish that you will see with silver items, but pure copper.",15959,1
15959,It was obvious it was plated and the listing is misleading.,15959,1
15959,"Based on the $2 I paid, I wouldn't complain except I was led to believe that it was in fact solid sterling silver.",15959,1
15959,I have to say I am really disappointed.,15959,1
15959,I had ordered in November and had actually thought about purchasing a few for gifts.,15959,1
15959,I am just really happy that I did not.,15959,1

15967,After wearing these they both threw them out.,15967,1
15968,"This dress is adorable in the picture, but hideous in real life.",15968,1
15968,The dress is made of an awful parachute-like material and the dress arrived differently than pictured.,15968,1
15968,It was more yellow than ivory/eggshell for the bodice portion.,15968,1
15968,I was expecting more of an off-white than yellow.,15968,1
15968,"The bottom portion is not flattering and the dress hits at a awkward spot, not at my natural waist.",15968,1
15968,The belt is very cheap looking and an awful orange-y brown color.,15968,1

15974,Extremely disappointed.,15974,1
15975,Very cheap quality.,15975,1
15975,The lace is gold not quite like the picture.,15975,1

15978,Looks trashy,15978,1
15979,I LOVED the Orthoheel slippers you used to make.,15979,1
15979,"They were corduroy, with a fleece inside.",15979,1
15979,I am desperately looking for the same slipper.,15979,1
15979,"The problem with this slipper is that it is a scuff, with no heel support, and it slips right off my feet.",15979,1
15979,I cannot keep them on!,15979,1
15979,Please bring back your corduroys with the wonderful arch support!,15979,1

15979,:(,15979,1
15980,I returned the product the very next day.,15980,1
15980,"Granted it's inexpensive, but in person it looks cheap.",15980,1
15980,"Poorly constructed, it does not have the same silhouette as the photo.",15980,1
15980,"More so, the half belt and A-line shape make it look like a ladies jacked.",15980,1
15980,This is definitely a no go.,15980,1
15981,The leggings have tiny holes everywhere.,15981,1
15981,I'm very unhappy with them.,15981,1
15981,I've purchased them in msny colors and the others after one wash have tiny holes too so I didn't complain but these came with holes.,15981,1
15981,It's  terrible,15981,1
15982,"It is functional, and the right shape/size (just a tiny bit bigger than a business card holder).",15982,1
15982,"However, you have to press in a piece of metal to open it.",15982,1
15982,"It is hard to push, and is painful to open.",15982,1
15982,The metal piece just hurts.,15982,1
15982,The pictures hide the latch and make it look harmless.,15982,1
15982,I would not recommend this item.,15982,1
15983,This dress looks much prettier in the picture.,15983,1
15983,The material on the skirt is very heavy and looks cheap compared to the lace on the top.,15983,1
15983,Not a dress to pick if you want something fancy.,15983,1
15983,It also runs slightly large.,15983,1
15984,The bracelet was gaudy and the charms too small.,15984,1
15985,"If you are looking for a 70""s costume for Halloween I strongly suggest this outfit, other wise stay away.",15985,1
15985,Its not esthetically flattering on any body and what is shown in the photo is not what you get in the delivery.,15985,1
15985,The fabric is a heavy thick poly nylon and the pockets serve no use except to make your hips appear wider in the front.,15985,1
15986,Terrible product.,15986,1
15986,It stopped at my mid calf.,15986,1
15986,Poor quality.,15986,1
15986,Don't buy this dress.,15986,1

15987,Cheap material!,15987,1
15988,Would have loved to love this but the zipper is poor quality and would not stay up in just the time I tried it on.,15988,1
15988,It only stays zipped up if you zip it all the way to the chin.,15988,1
15988,Does not stay up in the way the photo pictures it.,15988,1
15989,Terrible quality.,15989,1
15989,The cross doesnt stay around the other part of necklace and falls off.,15989,1
15990,Item did not appear to be new; lace was frayed and looked worn,15990,1
15991,I am shocked this dress has so many favorable reviews.,15991,1
15991,The material was cheap and it looked and felt it.,15991,1
15991,I was not about to put this near my precious baby's skin.,15991,1
15991,I did not even try it on her before returning.,15991,1
15992,Hair ties don't stay on it at all.,15992,1
15992,Don't waste your money.,15992,1
15992,Spend the extra money and buy the original by Bitter Sweet.,15992,1
15993,"I am 5 foot 2, 125lbs very athletic.",15993,1
15993,I ordered a large because reviews said it runs small.,15993,1
15993,The top was too small for me (34D) the length was perfect and the hips perfect (33 inch hips) the waist is made for someone with a tummy.,15993,1
15993,It was all baggy on me.,15993,1
15993,"If you are petite,small chested and have a tummy this dress is for you!",15993,1
15993,But order two sizes up.,15993,1
15993,Print was a cheap paint expect to hand wash and air dry.,15993,1
15994,"This is a no brand product, the brand could not be Versace collection",15994,1
15995,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.,15995,1
15995,Because of the design of the shoe my daughter developed a HUGE blister on the arch side of BOTH feet.,15995,1
15995,And since it's been 60 days we cant return them.,15995,1
15995,Shoes were on for almost 2 hours and have inch long blisters on size 4 feet (2 year old).,15995,1
15995,DO NOT BUY THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT.,15995,1
15996,I found these useless.,15996,1
15996,The fabric is silky so it does nothing to hold in the tummy.,15996,1
15997,this is not a sweatshirt more like a long sleeved shirt.,15997,1
15997,the material is very thin.,15997,1
15997,toothless and stitch look terrible and there is a white outline around the picture of them.,15997,1
15997,I should have saved my money on that day,15997,1
15998,Skirt a little too short and the jacket was way too tight.,15998,1

16220,A $10.00  rosary posing as a $30.00 one.,16220,1
16220,Feather light with a flimsy wire connecting the cross to the chain.,16220,1
16220,In fact the cross fell off mine while it was in a rosary pouch.,16220,1
16220,I doubt if it would stand up to even occasional light use..,16220,1
16221,"Very week, Right side broke off in no time.",16221,1
16221,The colored ear pieces are really hard to change out.,16221,1
16221,These are not so great.,16221,1
16222,This purchase was a waste of my money.,16222,1
16222,They come from China and the sizes are probably to fit Chinese girls not American women.,16222,1
16222,Couldn't return bcuz the shipping back would have cost me twice what the item costs.,16222,1
16222,Totally dissatisfied with this purchase & company.,16222,1

16224,It is a pretty bracelet .,16224,1
16224,Looks good feels good.,16224,1
16224,But it is not a very strong product.,16224,1
16224,On the 2nd day of my wearing it ... one ball cracked and fell off from the strand.,16224,1
16224,I somehow fixed it with wax.,16224,1
16224,Not a worthy product to put money in.,16224,1
16225,Too narrow.,16225,1
16226,This dress is crap!,16226,1
16226,If I could give zero stars I would.,16226,1
16226,I am pretty small I weigh 115 and I'm 5'2 and this dress fits a 12 year old.,16226,1

16230,Didn't fit.,16230,1
16231,Too short.,16231,1
16231,Uncomfortable to work out with it.,16231,1
16232,Came broken.,16232,1

16233,"Also, this was way too small.",16233,1
16234,looks nothing like the photo.,16234,1
16234,"Coloring is off, sizing is for children, padding is out of place and it looks like it was made in a sweat shop.",16234,1
16234,Horrible !,16234,1
16234,!,16234,1
16234,returned immediately !,16234,1
16235,I ordered the size 6 for my 5 yr old and could NOT believe how small the shorts were.,16235,1
16235,Had to check to see if the wrong size was sent.,16235,1
16235,Nope!,16235,1
16235,Just insanely tiny.,16235,1
16235,More like a 3T.,16235,1
16235,"The shorts are a very, very lightweight cotton poplin (no stretch), and not the best quality.",16235,1
16235,The shirt was more like the size of a 4T.,16235,1
16235,I gave the outfit to a friend who has a 2 year old.,16235,1
16235,The only thing good about this outfit was the laugh we had when we saw the size of it.,16235,1
16236,It was nothing like the picture and it was way to small,16236,1
16237,Ordered extra large and it was at least 3 sizes too small.,16237,1
16237,"Couldn't button over my chest, Gave it to a gf, size 4, she loves it.",16237,1
16238,"Sadly, the straps did not last long.",16238,1
16238,"After about a month and a half, the straps split where they attached to the bag and are literally holding on by a thread.",16238,1
16238,"I did not have much in here and wasn't overloaded; I used it to corral all my daily necessities like wallet, glasses, lip gloss, feminine products.",16238,1
16238,"I know it was an inexpensive bag, but I've bought bags similarly priced at Target that lasted years.",16238,1
16238,Disappointed.,16238,1
16239,Swimsuit was entirely to small l!!!,16239,1
16239,I ordered a X-large..,16239,1
16239,I do not advice for anyone to buy,16239,1
16240,They were not leather and you said the price was $72.00 the original  and they really look cheap,16240,1
16241,Horrible sizing.,16241,1
16241,I normally wear size medium in most things but a little bigger for pants cuz or my butt... i ordered an XL just to be safe going up 2 sizes and not only could i not get it even close to being zippered or closed but it was also way too short.,16241,1
16241,"Im 5'8"" so not super tall either.",16241,1
16241,U have to be tiny to wear this,16241,1
16242,I bought the 2X but it is wayyyyyy smaller than the size chart listed.,16242,1
16242,It also is made from thin cheap fabric with very little stretch.,16242,1
16242,Buy two sizes up.,16242,1
16243,This product was not as described.,16243,1
16243,The measurements did not match the shipped item.,16243,1
16243,"The set I received, was also stained, and poorly stitched.",16243,1
16243,"Went back and forth with the seller, and ultimately got a full refund.",16243,1
16243,Keep in mind that this runs about 3-4 SIZES TOO SMALL.,16243,1
16243,"I accounted for about two, and trusted the measurement conversions; subtract about 2.5 inches from what you think something will measure if you decided to buy it.",16243,1
16244,"I wanted this to fit, it's so cute!",16244,1
16244,but ordered 3xl and it fits like a medium!,16244,1
16244,So disappointed!,16244,1
16245,This isn't a towel.,16245,1
16245,It's more like an incredibly thin blanket.,16245,1
16245,I was really disappointed in the product.,16245,1
16246,Horrible product,16246,1
16247,I never got a chance to use - had to return.,16247,1
16247,My item must never have been checked for quality before being shipped.,16247,1
16247,The clear plastic was horribly scratched and looked terrible.,16247,1
16248,Thank god I read the reviews.,16248,1
16248,I got a large and it fit like a small.,16248,1
16248,"It's ok, nothing great.",16248,1
16249,Beautiful color and pattern but is huge!,16249,1
16250,This bathing suit is just awkward.,16250,1
16250,It needs to come with instructions.,16250,1
16250,Do not waste your money.,16250,1
16251,I am a size large.,16251,1
16251,"I ordered an XL and it didn't fit at all, it was even snug around shoulders.",16251,1
16251,The tags were cut off so I can't say if they sent correct size or not!,16251,1
16251,"They refuse to pay for return shipping, because it's ""my mistake""??",16251,1
16251,I ordered another coat from Amazon  & that one fit perfectly!,16251,1
16251,As soon as I took this coat out of the package I knew it was way too small!,16251,1
16251,"i would say this is like a regular ""S"" size!",16251,1
16251,I'm thinking of just giving it away to someone... Not worth paying for shipping.,16251,1
16251,Giving it one star because it is cute.,16251,1
16252,"Sooooo cheaply made, broke in five minuets, save your pennies.",16252,1
16253,NOT a sweater!!!,16253,1
16253,Synthetic rag!,16253,1
16253,!,16253,1
16254,I was unfortunately displeased with this item.,16254,1
16254,I've just received this and it appears to have been crunched at some point.,16254,1
16254,Chips and splinters all along the edges.,16254,1
16254,Scrapes and peeling on the inside as well.,16254,1
16254,I was really looking forward to giving this as a gift based on the reviews and a friend of mine recommended it because he loved his so much.,16254,1
16254,Maybe I got a dud but I'm disappointed none the less.,16254,1
16255,I buy large and everything.,16255,1
16255,But excel in these due to other reviews.,16255,1
16255,Still too small.,16255,1
16255,Threw them in the trash because it was too big of a hassle to return them.,16255,1
16256,Horrible quality!,16256,1
16256,Would not recommend.,16256,1
16256,Tried to get my money back but they are out of China.,16256,1
16257,Poorly made,16257,1
16258,Cheap.,16258,1
16258,Very very thin.,16258,1
16258,Ugh.,16258,1
16259,Way too short and wide.,16259,1
16259,Don't waste your money.,16259,1
16260,Item received was not the items pictured.,16260,1
16260,Can not use.,16260,1
16261,"Not neatly as nice as picture, I immediately popped it in the pike for donation.",16261,1
16261,Maybe someone else can do something with it.,16261,1
16262,Bought this dress bc I saw it on my Pinterest board.,16262,1
16262,DO NOT BUY IT!!!,16262,1
16262,Looks like China took a picture of it and printed it on a table cloth.,16262,1
16263,Stuff is really bad like very sheer you cant wear it without showing off your undies and bra.,16263,1
16263,I wouldn't recommend it.,16263,1
16264,Am so pissed with the way these products from China mislead people.,16264,1
16264,"Bag looks nothing like the picture shown, color is not even bright like the picture, color is like some dull dark red.",16264,1
16264,Nothing close to worthy of the price.,16264,1
16264,"My money is wasted, Sad i couldn't send it back buy give iy as a gift cause the cost for shipment would be half the price of the bag.",16264,1
16265,Small in size,16265,1
16266,Bad quality.,16266,1
16266,Bad dress.,16266,1
16266,Bad size.,16266,1
16266,"I'm 5""3 and this dress came about 4 inches above my ankle.",16266,1
16266,"Its in no way a ""Maxi Dress"".",16266,1
16266,It looks as if someone cut the bottom off with broken scissors.,16266,1
16266,Really though.,16266,1
16266,I hate this dress and couldn't wait to send it back.,16266,1
16266,I ordered the purple.,16266,1
16267,This looks so cheap.,16267,1
16267,Don't buy it.,16267,1
16267,The print and color were completely different,16267,1
16268,Incorrect color!,16268,1
16269,Gives you horrible shape!,16269,1
16269,If you are looking for something to slim you down this is not for you.,16269,1
16270,Was a little dinged and dark rusty looking type spots....expecting a cleaner look like the picture.,16270,1
16271,Necklace broke the second day my daughter wore it.,16271,1
16272,First of all this shirt is hideous.,16272,1
16272,"The weord synthetic fabric, the loose seams, the huge lace hanging off the arms.",16272,1
16272,The shirt in the first picture is not what you get.,16272,1
16272,"Be sure to scroll through the images and you'll see the thin, partially sheer fabric and ridiculously huge lace that is not sewed around the edges, so it hangs off awkwardly.",16272,1
16272,"Beyond thay, reading the reviews that tgis runs small, I ordered a large.",16272,1
16272,I'm a size 2.,16272,1
16272,"I am 5'3"".",16272,1
16272,I would say I'm pretty petite.,16272,1
16272,I don't know that this large will even fit me and I'm usually an xs.,16272,1
16272,That's how ridiculously small this is.,16272,1
16272,Don't buy this shirt.,16272,1
16272,It took at least a month to arrive and it's absolute crap.,16272,1
16273,This is not what I was expecting.,16273,1
16273,I was looking for a pencil skirt with clean lines.,16273,1
16273,It was more like a tube top t-shirt of thin jersey cotton that you wear around your waist.,16273,1
16273,I would feel that it is too sheer to wear outside the house.,16273,1
16274,Broken before I could wear them..,16274,1
16275,Runs VERY small!!!,16275,1
16275,!,16275,1
16276,"The tapers are like most tapers, long and bulky so not pointing fingers there.",16276,1
16276,But the real problem comes with the tunnels.,16276,1
16276,"The lip on the tunnels is so small that it let my swollen, newly stretched ear go over it and take the earring in.",16276,1
16276,"Also the width of the tunnel is way to small for a swollen lobe, they suck.",16276,1
16277,Keep your money,16277,1
16278,Awful material....,16278,1
16279,"I wore the swimsuit once, washed it on the DELICATE CYCLE, and when I pulled it out of the washer to air dry, *BOTH OF THE UNDERWIRE'S HAD PUNCHED THROUGH THE INSIDE FRONTS OF THE TOP!",16279,1
16279,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!",16279,1
16279,One use AND YOUR DONE!,16279,1
16280,"The shoes came with marks on them, as if they had been used previously.",16280,1
16281,I would not recommend this dress.,16281,1
16281,The material is shiny and cheap.,16281,1
16281,"If it was in cotton modal, 5 inches longer in the rear, and the chest/front would stay 'closed' (it was too large) it would've been fabulous.",16281,1
16281,"1 star, for arriving on time.",16281,1
16281,It would cost more than the cost of the dress to ship it back to International location.,16281,1
16281,"Therefore, it is at my local consignment store.",16281,1
16281,"And yes, I did inquire about an full refund.",16281,1
16281,The seller gave another option.,16281,1
16282,"I was really anticipating the arrival of this monokini, and now that it finally arrived, after twenty days, I could not be more disappointed with this item.",16282,1
16282,"Here is the list of grievances:
The monokini is crocheted from one end to the other, which makes it see-through everywhere, including the hiney and the boobs.",16282,1
16282,There is only a small piece of double-up right at the crotch area.,16282,1
16282,"The butt cheeks don't fit into the pants part, as about 2 inches of my crack are sticking out, no matter how I try to pull up on it.",16282,1
16282,"Looking at the picture where the model shows her back side, you can see how she pulled the panties into her butt, way up to manage to cover the crack.",16282,1
16282,"I am not into wedgies, so that would not be a viable option for me.",16282,1
16282,"The boobs are not supported at all, as the brassiere part is just knitted, not shaped.",16282,1
16282,"The padding insert is off-white, not black, which would make it look better.",16282,1
16282,One can see the padding through the knitwear.,16282,1
16282,"Also, this model on the pic must have boobs made in Siliconia, as they stand up like no natural breast of that size ever would.",16282,1
16282,"So, if you have natural breasts, expect them to slide out of the cups, unless you tie that thin string underneath so fast in the back that you can't breathe well anymore.",16282,1
16282,"I am a cup C size, and the cups of the one I got are barely covering up, they are about one third smaller than shown in this picture.",16282,1
16282,The middle part is crocheted so loosely that it can pull out to double its length without much effort.,16282,1
16282,"I suspect that in the water, it will stretch out even more!",16282,1
16282,"(I did not want to make it wet, so I did not test this, but I'm willing to take a gamble on this hypothesis, lol).",16282,1
16282,"I could imagine that this concept might work, if they had made the top and bottom of regular swimwear material, and only made the middle part in crochet.",16282,1
16282,"The tie strings around the neck and in the back are just a very thin crochet cord, and the ends are already fraying.",16282,1
16282,These will unravel in no time.,16282,1
16282,"And because they are so thin, they cut especially into the neck, and just a little less in the back.",16282,1
16282,I can only imagine that this will get worse when the skin gets wet and softens up.,16282,1
16282,Chafing is waiting to happen!,16282,1
16282,I added a pic of the frayed end of the tie cord.,16282,1
16282,The other three ends look just like this one.,16282,1
16282,"On the second pic, I also am showing how you can see my fingers through the knitwear on the butt area.",16282,1
16282,The swim suit is going back as soon as I get the label printed.,16282,1
16282,"If my review was helpful to you, thanks for letting me know!",16282,1
16283,I've worn adhesive bras before and love them.,16283,1
16283,This one simply is not adhesive at all.,16283,1
16283,"I haven't even wore it out, just tried it on with some clothes.",16283,1
16283,It lightly sticks on your skin and then when you move it begins falling off.,16283,1
16283,I know it's extremely affordable but just invest a little bit more for a better product.,16283,1
16283,Wish I still had the receipt and original packaging... Can I get my money back?,16283,1
16283,"However, I was contacted by the seller, who was very apologetic and looked for ways to make things right.",16283,1
16283,They refunded my purchase very quickly.,16283,1
16283,They do have good customer service.,16283,1
16283,(updated 7/29/16),16283,1
16284,"Ordered medium , got large and now have to waste time with the return , very disappointed",16284,1
16285,I ordered small size.. the fabric is not as expected.. disappointed with the fitting i have to send for alterarion to fit to me.,16285,1
16286,Too small,16286,1
16287,No comment,16287,1
16288,Fits nothing like the picture and cheap material.,16288,1

16290,I recommend you discontent that vendor.,16290,1
16291,It is too small and there is no returning paper inside,16291,1
16292,Please don't buy these.,16292,1
16292,I'm okay with the quality but it's too hard to click in and it's hard to unclick.,16292,1
16292,The little bar wiggles around too much to click it in.,16292,1
16292,All 4 of them suck.,16292,1
16292,I'm incredibly disappointed.,16292,1
16293,Fit as expected until I washed it and even hung it to try...,16293,1
16293,It can now be worn as s shirt!,16293,1
16293,Disappointed as it was very cute.,16293,1
16294,Honestly.,16294,1
16294,Wow.,16294,1
16294,I figured since it said fit as expected that the large would have been big enough for my bf but it's even tight on me so I couldn't even give it to him.,16294,1
16294,And trying to return and get a refund is honestly the biggest hassle.,16294,1
16294,At this point I'd be happy if they just sent me a new one in the bigger size free of charge.,16294,1
16294,But I guess that's not how it works but yea.,16294,1
16294,Order a size up than what you'd normally wear.,16294,1

16358,"I am a 5'8"" 135 lb girl and I ordered the small size for this dress because other reviews said it ran large.",16358,1

16410,I am very disappointed.,16410,1
16410,"She was so excited about this suit, and cried when it didn't fit.",16410,1
16411,Rings end up losing the screws and kept  falling  off no good,16411,1
16412,Obviously the sizing runs a size to size and a half too small - This top was an XL - or at least that's what the description and the tag said- no way.,16412,1
16413,"Expected a cool collar design as pictured, but it didn't really do much of anything.",16413,1
16414,Much smaller fit than expected.,16414,1
16414,Item being returned.,16414,1
16415,Absolutely horrible I ordered medium came as extra small,16415,1
16416,This product was described to be 100% cotton....NOT!,16416,1
16416,Less than 50% cotton.,16416,1
16416,Totally misrepresented.,16416,1
16416,Not worth the trouble to return.,16416,1
16416,I won't be a repeat customer.,16416,1
16417,This tie is not worth $1!,16417,1
16417,The design is spray painted on the fabric.,16417,1
16417,It is an ugly yellow color.,16417,1
16417,This is NOT a Trump tie.,16417,1
16417,"It does not have the Trump name on it, it is from Dainamo.",16417,1
16417,"It is a cheap piece of fabric that belongs on a clown suit, not with a professional appearance.",16417,1
16417,Extremely disappointed.,16417,1
16418,dont buy this.,16418,1
16418,small in the bottom to big on top.,16418,1
16418,don't bring any support on top.,16418,1
16418,good fabric but badly made it.,16418,1
16419,Really huge for a small smh!,16419,1
16419,I hate it!,16419,1
16419,Only thing was nice was the bright yellow!,16419,1
16420,I did not receive anything close to what was in the picture.,16420,1
16420,I didn't wanna bother returning it but like it was not at all a wearable piece of clothing,16420,1
16421,I thought it would be nice but it's not.unpainted black rust underneath the bracelet and not even working.don't buy it.,16421,1
16422,VerY width,16422,1
16423,This dress is beautiful from the front however the back of the dress is absolutely not flattering at all.,16423,1
16423,I bought two sizes because I was not sure which would fit the best and when I got ready to return them the shipping fee to China was so ridiculous I  decided to sell them in a garage sale .,16423,1
16424,I wish I could return it.,16424,1
16424,Nice packaging but otherwise really not appealing at all.,16424,1
16424,Very sensitive.,16424,1
16425,Cheaply made had lots of frayed thread coming out from the bowtie,16425,1
16426,the measurements were wrong,16426,1
16427,Thin fabric and XL can fit a small ..,16427,1
16428,Very small,16428,1
16429,Liked the style but size was not right.,16429,1
16429,The shoulders fit but the hips did not match.,16429,1
16429,Even the Large was too tight.,16429,1
16430,Too small.,16430,1
16430,Even with the sizing chart.,16430,1
16430,OR may be its not for built dudes.,16430,1
16431,"Here's my take on all the 1-star reviews for these briefs and why:

I initially bought a 3-pack through amazon.ca (I'm in Toronto), absolutely love them; then found them here on the U.S. site for much cheaper so purchased them again through a U.S. friend's account.",16431,1
16431,"Although the tags of both sport the same product number (R/N# 97404) the better-fitting first set are made in Thailand and are 82% cotton/8% spandex, while the U.S.-sourced briefs are made in Bangladesh and are 100% cotton.",16431,1
16431,"The first set (Thailand ones) sport the classic 2Xist ""pouch"" and fit the thighs of us bigger guys perfectly, maintaining their shape all day; while the newer designed Made-in-Bangladesh versions have a much smaller pouch and lose their shape in the legs within an hour or two of wear.",16431,1
16431,Those of us that are fans of the classic 2(x)IST brief need to email the company's head office in Dayton NJ (e2xist@2xist.com) and voice our disappointment at the loss of the original product.,16431,1
16432,The belts are very good quality but an 1 1/2 inches wide and very heavy canvas and the rings are to large and heavy for a small woman or girl.,16432,1
16432,I was hoping for 1 inch and lighter canvas plus smaller ring.,16432,1
16432,I don't like the buckle/rings to show under my blouses/shirts on low rise jeans/slacks.,16432,1
16432,Great quality but just to big and bulky.,16432,1
16432,"To return them, I must send them to China so I can't afford the postage.",16432,1
16433,I chose the burgundy dress.,16433,1
16433,The top looks like there is black beads.,16433,1
16433,I got the dress and they are a red while the bottom of the dress is almost a purple.,16433,1
16433,This disappointed me.,16433,1
16433,"The dress is to tight in the arms, to loose in the boobs, and to loose in the hips.",16433,1
16433,I did use the measurements that were provided.,16433,1
16433,The mesh was tight and rubbed under my arm pits and was painful.,16433,1
16433,There was excess mesh around my neck.,16433,1
16433,I got a size 16.,16433,1
16433,"I am 5'2, and 144 pounds.",16433,1
16433,I usually wear a size 10 to 12.,16433,1
16434,The colors are significantly different from the image picture and not what I wanted.,16434,1
16434,I am not at all happy with this purchase/item.,16434,1
16435,Id like no star.,16435,1
16435,Awful material.,16435,1
16435,Within an hour of receiving it the metallic blue started smearing off in spots and looks awful Seams came loose after putting on for second time.,16435,1
16435,Do not buy if you want good quality.,16435,1
16436,It is too long for my torso.,16436,1
16436,I need a short one.,16436,1
16436,Cut under my boobs..,16436,1
16437,This is insanely small.,16437,1
16437,"I read the reviews and for a boy who wears T2 I ordered the 3/4, it looks like it's for a smaller sized 1 year old child.",16437,1
16437,The stitching is awful as well.,16437,1
16437,Cheaply made.,16437,1
16437,Very disappointed.,16437,1
16438,To small - made cheap,16438,1
16439,The size runs extremely small and the fabric was cheaper than expected.,16439,1
16439,"I would have exchanged it for a larger size, but I was told it was too late to exchange it.",16439,1
16440,They bad thing is that I could not return it because it was going to cost $60 to ship back and I bought two one for me and my mom.,16440,1
16440,The items are not sized US it was way to small.,16440,1
16441,Very Cute..inexpensive....made cheap ..but the frame lens came out the frame,16441,1
16442,Really tiny.,16442,1
16442,Not a size large.,16442,1
16443,Way to small even my 12 year old can't get them on!,16443,1
16443,Sucks,16443,1
16444,"I could fit into it, but the skirt was so short it didn't even cover my bottom.",16444,1
16444,It is more like a peplum top.,16444,1
16445,"The 3XL, was really more like XL..... Perhaps because it came from Italy and they have a different perspective on shirt sizes...thank goodness I'm on a weight loss program.",16445,1
16445,In the closet until it fits.,16445,1
16445,"Be aware though.... if you need a 3XL, get two sizes larger!!",16445,1
16445,Weird but true...,16445,1
16446,"Bad cut, see through.",16446,1
16446,Not flattering to anyone who is t cosmetically enhanced in multiple places :(,16446,1
16447,Very small,16447,1
16448,Top & bottom colors did not match - poorly made.,16448,1
16449,"First of all, the materials is horrible, and the color pictured is not correct at all.",16449,1
16449,"I ordered the dark green (emerald) color, which is more of a pastel.",16449,1
16449,Super disappointed,16449,1
16450,badly cut at the top.,16450,1
16450,We will toss it.,16450,1
16451,The dress was too big and I'm going to send it back.,16451,1
16451,"I'm 5'5"" and weigh 137 lbs and the dress fits me like a size 12-14.",16451,1
16451,I plan to send it back on Monday.,16451,1
16451,"I usually order a size 36"" bust and the M/L was within the range listed on the sizing guide.",16451,1
16451,I'm disappointed the dress is really festive for the holidays.,16451,1
16452,NOT THE SAME FROM PICTURE!!,16452,1
16452,"Looks really really cheap and color is more like a camel, im extremely dissaponted!",16452,1
16452,Not even worth half of it!,16452,1
16452,"I don't recommend buying it, don't waste your money, i will give it away to charity...",16452,1
16453,This is soooooo small that not even a child can fit into it.,16453,1
16453,No amount of stretching this will make it fit.,16453,1
16453,I'm so upset because the picture and the descriptions are very misleading.,16453,1
16453,I just don't know what to do because it looked like it was going to be a perfect fit for my skirt.,16453,1
16454,"LOVE the saying, I just wish this shirt wasn't made as doll clothing.",16454,1
16454,WAY too small.,16454,1
16455,Too large and bad material,16455,1
16456,Ok I ordered a 5XL FOR myself and I don't even know what size this shirt this is.,16456,1
16456,tag say a 5xl but for what a Barbie doll?,16456,1
16456,This won't even fit for my 13 yr old.,16456,1
16456,Very disappointed plus shipping was very slow.,16456,1
16457,I wish this bracelet worked out.,16457,1
16457,"The chain from the finger to the wrist is very long, too long for any size hand.",16457,1
16457,The chain that wrapped around the wrist is also too large so it just flops everywhere.,16457,1
16457,"Great idea, just poorly executed.",16457,1
16458,Opened the box and it was broken.,16458,1
16458,Unwearable broken.,16458,1
16458,This isn't something that took place in shipping.,16458,1
16458,Someone had to of thrown it in the box like that.,16458,1
16458,Pathetic,16458,1
16459,this jacket is a waste of money.,16459,1
16459,if you want to return it prepare to spend 40 dollars to ship it back to china.,16459,1
16459,i am very upset that I'm stuck with this ugly horrible jacket.,16459,1
16459,it does not fit as described and is very very cheap looking.,16459,1
16459,i will not and would not ever buy from this vendor again.,16459,1
16460,I bought a size up as suggested and the dress is too big.,16460,1

16460,Would Like a refund.,16460,1
16460,Shipping was fast.,16460,1

16461,"I only got one, gray......... all other colors out of stock, waiting.",16461,1
16461,Fit perfect...,16461,1
16462,Didn't really like this Kimono.,16462,1
16462,It looks more like a graduation gown.,16462,1
16462,I'm 127 lbs and 5'3 and got the small and it fits great.,16462,1
16463,this item is not as pictured; it's a top that may come to the hips at best; extremely small; ordered one size larger and it's a Junior medium at best; certainly not a womens large.,16463,1
16463,Not a dress at all - and cheap quality fabric,16463,1
16464,Amazing style but with 99c quality lenses.,16464,1
16464,Had to return them.,16464,1
16464,Lenses were completely stained as if they were made of cheap plastic.,16464,1
16464,These just can't be good for your eyes.,16464,1
16464,It's sad because I really love the shape of the frame as these suit most face shapes.,16464,1
16464,I do own a pair of quay sunglasses but they are nothing like this one.,16464,1
16464,Makes me wonder if these are fake.,16464,1
16465,The top is just a wrap.,16465,1
16465,"Thought it was an actual bikini top, it's not.",16465,1
16465,I won't wear it,16465,1

16531,Pros: The boot is adorable and fits perfectly.,16531,1
16531,Cons: The handle broke within a few weeks.,16531,1
16531,My 3 year old does not have superpowers while pulling her boots up which tells me that the handles are not manufactured very well.,16531,1

16572,This is the worst thing I have ever gotten on the internet.,16572,1
16572,I had a feeling it was coming from China and may look a little different but the jacket is as wide as it should be long so you would need to be a marshmallow person to actually fit into it with a tiny torso.,16572,1
16572,Also looks completely different than the picture.,16572,1
16572,I mean it's about the same color but those buttons?,16572,1
16572,"Those ""patches""?",16572,1

16741,"After numerous emails back n forth from seller, $60 in expedited fees plus dress costs, 3 different dresses (one that could fit a 300+lb, 7ft woman) for my 5 year old and 6 weeks later...",16741,1
16741,I was finally refunded all my money back and a dress I originally ordered and it's actually still too big but fits much better to be altered.,16741,1

16745,"Faded the first day i wore it, then tangled and i could never unravel itm",16745,1
16746,Took forever to arrive and was wrinkled and appeared to be used.,16746,1
16747,God awful.,16747,1
16748,"Wore it once, it looked not so great.",16748,1
16748,The bow was awkwardly set.,16748,1
16748,The sleeves were too puffy.,16748,1
16748,Pretty cheap looking in person.,16748,1
16749,Really soft fabric.,16749,1
16749,I was really excited to try this on.,16749,1
16749,Sadly the inseam is crazy short.,16749,1
16750,Broke before my girlfriend could wear it.,16750,1
16750,Great design on pendant but needs a better chain.,16750,1

16754,"Order 3 sizes larger, if they come that big",16754,1
16755,This is such a disappointing product to receive!,16755,1
16755,I ordered this shirt dress for the summer and had it  as part of an order that I had delivered to my Mother in the states and then shipped me to where I live in Tokyo so it's difficult for me to return it.,16755,1
16755,The material isn't at all what was suggested.,16755,1
16755,It's not a jersey blend nor is the garment cut the way that it appears in the images as it's advertised.,16755,1
16755,The material is a very cheap and thin polyblend plastic feeling material with little give which is extremely unforgiving since the cut of the garment is pretty much useless to a woman's form.,16755,1
16755,"If you want a hospital gown that feels like a shower curtain, then Merry Christmas!",16755,1
16756,Fit was a big problem,16756,1

16758,MY HUSBAND WON'T USE IT!,16758,1
16759,I'd give it no stars if I could.,16759,1
16759,I'm not sure what people got who gave 5 stars but the item I got was cheap with iron on letters that were crooked.,16759,1
16759,Not to mention I ordered a large bc I like things to fit big and it seriously looks like a youth small.,16759,1
16760,The picture doesnt show an accurate depiction of the material of the dress.,16760,1
16760,The material is silky and shiny and just not as appealing in person.,16760,1
16761,"Cheaply made, headband tight and tolerable only for a short time, ears do not stand out as pictured.",16761,1

16764,All I wanted was a pair of 100% cotton boxers.,16764,1
16764,Is that too much to ask?,16764,1
16764,And why are they so hard to find any more?,16764,1
16764,Specifically: They don't feel like 100% cotton.,16764,1
16764,Nor does it say anywhere on the package (or on the underwear) that they are 100% cotton.,16764,1
16764,"Maybe it's fine that fib in an Amazon listing, but illegal on a label.",16764,1
16764,Who knows.,16764,1
16764,"Anyway, more trouble than it's worth to return them.",16764,1
16764,Just gonna throw them away.,16764,1
16764,"If you want 100% cotton, look elsewhere.",16764,1

16766,Attempting to unbutton these to try the jacket on was a completely other issue.,16766,1
16766,Not to mention there's no warmth found in these jackets whatsoever.,16766,1
16766,Customer service also offered me a 50% refund after offering a full refund to everyone else I know that ordered it (these were ordered for a wedding party and were supposed to be used for pictures).,16766,1
16767,"They weren't kidding when they named this dress with the descriptor ""irregular hem""...goodness gracious!",16767,1
16767,"I got this dress to wear to a beach trip to Mexico, and the ONLY way I could have worn it is with a bathing suit because if I wore it with undies EVERYONE would've known what kind of panties I had on.",16767,1
16768,Because I didn't receive the one I choose.,16768,1
16768,I want to return it.,16768,1

16773,Never again!,16773,1
16773,!,16773,1
16774,It should come in an xs.,16774,1
16775,It was super heavy and hard to keep on my face to best display my eyes.,16775,1
16775,Even when tightened.,16775,1
16775,Definitely made very well!,16775,1
16775,"But, very hard to keep on, thus the low star review.",16775,1
16776,Piece of s***.,16776,1

16781,These things are not built to last.,16781,1
16781,"I'll admit that I think they look pretty nice, so if you need a quick fix they work, but for anything longer than about two weeks don't bother.",16781,1
16781,"The first pair that I bought had one lens pop out within the first week (which was fixable), and then about a week later one of the sides literally snapped off behind my ear when I went to take them off.",16781,1
16781,"So I should have learned my lesson, but I liked the look so I ordered a second pair.",16781,1
16781,"This pair broke even faster than the first one, in the exact same way... so now I've been prompted to write my first Amazon review.",16781,1

16787,Mine has a different back than is pictured here and it almost seemed like the front straps were accidently sewn on as back straps.,16787,1

17041,"Flimsy, short chain, really looks like a child's trinket.",17041,1
17041,"I know it's not silver but I expected something stainless steel, sturdier that would look cute, and that people who didn't even recognize the emblem would just think it was a pretty, simple necklace.",17041,1
17041,I may send this to my niece.,17041,1
17041,For a child it's acceptable.,17041,1

17045,I liked the lenght of the top but at the bottom on each side it flares out...and the bottom is a teeny bikini..I also did not like the fabric.,17045,1
17046,This dress would be great if it wasn't see through.,17046,1
17047,Even for a 4XL the top is more like a us small or medium.,17047,1
17047,Very disappointed that this isn't even close to what I would call an XL and knowing it was foreign and they run small I ordered 3 sizes up to try and cover.,17047,1

17054,"There is no chiffon in the ""Chiffon Colorblock"" dress.",17054,1

17054,"Of the 13 of us, one person had a dress that turned out like the picture here.",17054,1
17054,"It is lovely, but I have no idea how to guarantee another one will look the same.",17054,1

17058,Cheap though so not really worth the hassle of a return.,17058,1
17059,Definitely a China product so it should have cost $20!,17059,1
17059,Super small and poor quality and very thin.,17059,1
17059,I was disappointed taking it out of the bag - it comes in 2 pieces.,17059,1
17059,The material would attract every piece of lint possible and was cheap.,17059,1
17059,"Then trying to put the size L (which is a bit big for me but I want to wear sweaters under it)  was laughable as it ran more like a size S. As cute as this is in the picture, do not buy this coat.",17059,1

17170,But never have I been so disappointed in a seller or their product that I have felt like giving them a ZERO.,17170,1
17170,These are the reasons why I would not recommend them or their product.,17170,1

17170,These are advertised as Genie bras.,17170,1
17170,I sincerely doubt that these are genuine Genie bras.,17170,1
17170,There is absolutely nothing to identify these as being name brand Genie bras.,17170,1
17170,They arrived in clear cellophane bags -- no box or package that says Genie.,17170,1
17170,The inside writing on the bra does not say Genie.,17170,1

17170,"Other reviewers have complained about the sizing, some saying they were too tight.",17170,1

17170,4.,17170,1
17170,"When I tried them on, the band just rolled up.",17170,1
17170,"The padding inside the cups was cut too large for the actual cup size, so the padding curled out on the bottom creating a giant ridge -- just what you want for a smooth look under clothing, padding curled and sticking straight out.",17170,1
17170,5.,17170,1
17170,"Even with all of this, I was open to trying to resolve it with the seller, I contacted them via e-mail (through Amazon) with a request for return.",17170,1

17170,They attempted to contact the seller again to try to resolve the issue to no avail.,17170,1
17170,Amazon gave me a refund and I really appreciated it.,17170,1
17170,They took the time to make sure that I as a customer was satisfied and they made good on a transaction with a poor seller even though it was not their fault.,17170,1
17170,Thank you Amazon!,17170,1
17171,Way to big!,17171,1

17217,"Wow, this is a child's size or young teen sized shirt!",17217,1
17217,I ordered a medium because I am short in stature and larges don't hang right.,17217,1
17217,"The picture shows the shirt flowing and looking like it has a bell curve at the base, but it actually doesn't.",17217,1
17217,"It would be nicer if it were an 'A' type frame on the bottom half, instead it is pretty straight and fits snug, unless you are very slender, then it might look like the picture?",17217,1
17217,Or maybe I needed 2X when I normally wear a medium and sometimes small...,17217,1
17218,"This short is too small, waste of money.",17218,1
17218,The material is cheap!,17218,1

17225,Not at all what the picture looked like.,17225,1
17225,Thought I was getting a batwing sweater dress.,17225,1
17225,Material is so thin you can see through it and it's not batwing as much as just a bigger neckline.,17225,1
17225,I wouldn't waste my money if I was you.,17225,1
17225,Wish this had been reviewed before my purchase.,17225,1

17228,:(,17228,1

17231,Worse costume please don't buy.,17231,1

17232,There was a stain on the fabric and the seams were unfinished and frayed.,17232,1
17232,The sizing was also way off.,17232,1
17232,I had to return it.,17232,1
17232,"Thankfully, Amazon was understanding and I got free shipping.",17232,1
17232,I'll think twice before I order apparel from Amazon again.,17232,1

17251,"I was going to just put up with it, but now the other zipper is starting to go, so the backpack is just open all the time.",17251,1
17251,:c,17251,1
17252,This dress is only for petite women.,17252,1
17252,I ordered a Large ( I am usually a Medium ) I couldn't get it past my shoulders.,17252,1
17252,"Also, it takes a very long time to get it through the mail.",17252,1
17252,I am returning it.,17252,1

17253,You get what you pay for!,17253,1
17254,Got a XXL it was too small for my other half.,17254,1
17254,"And the material was too thin, so it ripped :(",17254,1
17255,Way too large.,17255,1
17256,Verryyyyy cheaplooking.,17256,1
17256,I will try to wear it & see if it looks better on :-(,17256,1
17257,"Garbage ,I put it in the trash.",17257,1
17257,Should be embarrassed to sell this but I guess you get what you pay for.,17257,1

17260,The wrist band holder broke as soon as I took it out of the box and tried it on.,17260,1
17261,"SO, not what the picture would lead you to believe.",17261,1
17261,"Now, in no way do I expect to get clothing and put it on my size 16 body and look like the models in the pictures.",17261,1
17261,"To be fair, the colors of the dress do look like the picture.",17261,1
17261,"However, if you are expecting the long, flowy-ness in the picture for this dress, you will be seriously disappointed.",17261,1
17261,"First, the material of this dress made me have a flashback to playing with an old parachute in elementary school P.E.",17261,1
17261,class...except thinner.,17261,1
17261,You can 100% see through this dress.,17261,1
17261,"Now, on to the hilariousness that happened up top with the girls when I put, er, squeezed this dress over my head.",17261,1
17261,I am pretty sure the girls think I just had a very strange mammogram.,17261,1
17261,They actually had no where to go (this fabric has no give at all) and were forced to search for any available space to spread themselves out in a way that resulted in looking like what I can only describe as a grandma who had just been sitting too close to the table with no bra on.,17261,1
17261,"In full disclosure, I have more than a generous helping up there, but I cannot see how anyone with any more than a B Cup (tops!)",17261,1
17261,could comfortably or flatteringly wear this dress.,17261,1
17261,There also might have been a minute when I tried to remove the dress and became worried I might suffocate with my arms straight up in the air and a ridiculous dress stuck on my face.,17261,1
17261,"I ordered the XXL, just FYI.",17261,1
17261,I have reluctantly included some pictures because I know how much it helps me to see clothing on real people when purchasing.,17261,1
17261,Don't look too close or laugh too hard.,17261,1
17262,30 w looks like at least 34 w. Dark color parts are much darker then shown on the picture.,17262,1

17264,Cheap material ripped on the first use runs small.,17264,1
17264,I would not buy again.,17264,1
17265,It broke:(,17265,1
17266,"Very unhappy, ordered a 2XL and it has ""2XL"" on the tab but is made to fit a woman that is a SM size NOT a 2XL.",17266,1
17267,"This is not a dress, it is a shirt.",17267,1
17267,"It covered my back side, but did not cover the front.",17267,1
17268,Worst,17268,1
17269,Beware!,17269,1
17269,Graphic detail and color of shirt does not match the picture in listing.,17269,1
17269,The shirt I received was an awful shade of gray and the design on the front of shirt was blurry and you can't tell what it is supposed to be.,17269,1
17269,"The only good quality of this shirt would be weight as it seems like a good quality shirt bit due to the appearance of it, I will never wear it in public.",17269,1
17269,Ships from China and seller does not respond to emails.,17269,1
17270,"it runs small, is very soft but has an off-putting industrial smell right out of the bag.",17270,1
17270,"the first day I wore it, it began to unravel at the seams: the side seam came undone from the bottom up about 8 inches, the armpit and sleeve/bodice seam came apart.",17270,1
17270,I had to find a sewing kit & repair it while at work!,17270,1
17270,Embarrasing!,17270,1
17270,would not recommend or buy from this brand ever again!,17270,1
17271,It doesn't work,17271,1
17272,Bottom too small,17272,1
17273,"Looks absolutely nothing like the picture, I was very excited about this dress too.",17273,1
17273,"The v is not deep at all and it runs small and the edge of the dress is just cut with what looks like scissors, very rough edges.",17273,1
17274,"Cool shirt however size was a size too small, not sure if this was a sizing problem or something tagging problem.",17274,1
17274,No exchange resolution offered when returning just a refund.,17274,1
17275,"Horrible, strap broke with first use and too small to easily fit larger phones.",17275,1
17276,"Listed as ""big kid"" when are actually toddler size.",17276,1
17276,Definitely being returned!,17276,1
17277,Way too small.,17277,1
17277,Order two sizes up,17277,1
17278,"This product was horrible,3xl was way too small,I totally wasted my money",17278,1
17279,This should be ZERO stars but the review wouldn't allow me to choose that option.,17279,1
17279,I am pretty upset at how poorly this veil was made.,17279,1
17279,"I bought this veil thinking it was beautiful and other reviews indicated it was ""pretty"" and how much they loved it.",17279,1
17279,"The lace was not cut properly, and the veil was attached to the hair comb backwards!",17279,1
17279,It almost seems like it was cut from somewhere else and attached to this veil.,17279,1
17279,I'm am truly disappointed.,17279,1
17279,I guess you get what you pay for.,17279,1
17280,If you can't stretch the neck hole wide enough to get you ENTIRE body through...hips and all.... then you can't even put it on....I've never seen anything made so poorly.,17280,1
17280,Wish I could give less stars.,17280,1
17281,I ordered this without reading the reviews.,17281,1
17281,Not a good move.,17281,1
17281,Because I would've been prepared for what I was getting.,17281,1
17281,These aren't cotton.,17281,1
17281,More like nylon tights.,17281,1
17281,They don't stretch much.,17281,1
17281,Hard to put on.,17281,1
17281,I'd say order 2 sizes up from what you'd normally wear.,17281,1
17282,My Daughter was so excited when I gave  this to her as a early bday gift before she went to school only to be disappointed that the chain broke within 45min of wearing it.,17282,1
17282,The ball it comes with doesn't fit inside the heart which defeats the purpose of changing the colors since I had to use a cotton ball.,17282,1
17282,Overall really cute but poorly made.,17282,1
17282,Would not recommend or purchase again.,17282,1
17282,I guess you get what you pay for.,17282,1

17283,It is too small!,17283,1
17284,I usually wear a size 4-6 and ordered a medium.,17284,1

17287,Causes a skin bump no matter how far you strech them out.,17287,1
17287,The look is not appealing.,17287,1
17287,I guess if you have sticks for legs li,17287,1
17288,"I ordered it for my mother, who is a size 3x usually, and then I went a size up as some reviews suggested, and it didn't fit her.",17288,1
17288,"I tried it on myself, and I'm around an XL or 1X tops, and it didn't fit me either.",17288,1

17311,However it quickly became obvious that they were too small when I started to put them on for the first time.,17311,1

17316,"Fell apart after being worn for a short period of time, and looked like it was discoloring as well.",17316,1

17643,Also this is a medium,17643,1
17644,Bought this for my husband - after reading all the mixed reviews I thought I would give it a chance (mainly due to a reviewer the same size as my hubs having so much room in his robe at 6'5).,17644,1

17676,These are def asian sizes and built for very thin boned or petite women.,17676,1
17676,And then I tried to request a return and they told me they'd only give me 16% of the purchase price back because of the international shipping.,17676,1
17676,Plus I would have to pay shipping back to China.,17676,1
17676,This is definitely not worth the risk.,17676,1

17685,"The material is sheer, and it fits completely differently than in the photo.",17685,1
17685,"In the photo it looks as if it is fitted, I'm thinking they are either using an entirely different shirt (because mind you in person it's not bright white it's more of a cream color) or they are tying it in the back of the model.",17685,1
17685,I ordered a small and it's huge.,17685,1
17685,Wouldn't waste my money on this.,17685,1
17686,It was too small... might need to order 3 sizes up...,17686,1
17687,They are pretty.,17687,1
17687,I am 5'4 and they were soo short on me.,17687,1
17687,They aren't very stretchy either which makes me tend not to work out in them.,17687,1
17688,Very disappointed!,17688,1
17688,Bought an extra large and is very very small.,17688,1
17688,Lace is coming apart in the front due to bad sewing and seams at shoulder are frayed.,17688,1
17689,"Extremely cheap,zipper broke the third day",17689,1
17690,Ordered a large and it was like an extra small size,17690,1
17691,No stars....... horrible fit and very cheap material.,17691,1
17692,Wasn't how I expected them to fit at all,17692,1
17693,"very thin see through fabric, the shoulder pieces are a very cheep plastic not worth it will never buy again i threw it away it wasn't even worth my time to send it back very disappointed",17693,1
17694,Horrible quality.,17694,1
17694,I have some other nice tassels that came with designer purses and I was hoping to add a pop of color to one of those purses with this tassel.,17694,1
17694,But it looks awful.,17694,1
17694,"The unfinished side of the leather strips are full of strings, lumps and bumps.",17694,1
17694,Looks very cheap.,17694,1
17694,"Would post a picture of it, but already gave it away to a kid at my garage sale since no one would buy it.",17694,1
17694,Either the good reviews posted here are fake or they sent me a bum tassel that somehow snuck past quality control.,17694,1
17694,Have seen better quality tassels in checkout lanes at big box stores.,17694,1
17695,To small cheap!,17695,1
17695,!,17695,1
17696,I will be returning these.,17696,1
17696,"They are flimsy and if you are sweating, they don't stay on.",17696,1
17696,Definitely not worth the price.,17696,1
17696,Very disappointed.,17696,1
17697,Quality is good.,17697,1
17697,But the tailoring is not at all like the photo.,17697,1
17697,"Arms and waist were way too short and I ordered a size up just in case, and still too small.",17697,1
17697,It felt like it was more a junior size top that for an adult woman.,17697,1
17698,tooooo small,17698,1
17699,Used for ear cartilage piercing... resulted in infected ear,17699,1
17700,Very poor quality,17700,1
17701,Don't wash this.,17701,1
17701,It will fade really bad with the very first washing.,17701,1
17701,"I wish I could get a refund for this, I LOVED it until I washed it.",17701,1
17702,Looks nothing like the picture,17702,1
17703,Don't fit.,17703,1
17703,Can't bend the metal to make them fit.,17703,1
17703,"Pretty, but useless to me.",17703,1
17703,Will be returning.,17703,1
17704,I got this bag two months ago and at first I liked it a lot.,17704,1
17704,"Its a good size, and looks good.",17704,1
17704,"Two months later, and two of the zippers are broken.",17704,1
17704,"I'm not doing anything strenuous with it, they just each let go.",17704,1
17704,"I don't expect a bag to last forever, but two months just doesn't seem like enough.",17704,1
17704,I emailed DDDH and they wrote me back that it isn't their problem after a month.,17704,1
17704,So much for standing behind their product.,17704,1
17704,I guess they know how cheaply made it is as well.,17704,1
17705,Advertising a sock as low cut must have a different meaning at Airwalk.,17705,1
17705,"These fit like no show socks, not low cut.",17705,1
17705,The heel will slide down in my shoes like no show socks I've tried in the past.,17705,1
17705,"If you want a no show sock, this may work.",17705,1
17705,But the elastic really doesn't hold very well.,17705,1
17706,This is one of the cheapest toys I've ever purchased.,17706,1
17706,Broke in a couple places within 10 minutes of my son playing with it.,17706,1
17706,"Totally lame, don't purchase!",17706,1
17707,Quite a disappointment.,17707,1
17707,I paid too much for this.,17707,1
17707,The design looks as if they smeared it on with pizza grease.,17707,1
17707,It is blotchy and I have to explain what the design is.,17707,1
17707,Save your money because this shirt isn't what is advertised.,17707,1
17708,I would give it zero stars but the site is making me give it at least 1 star.,17708,1
17708,I have NEVER seen something as poorly made as this shirt.,17708,1
17708,The edges are barely finished and the stitching is loose & extra loops of stitches hang off all over the place.,17708,1
17708,One corner has a hole in it & in at least 2 places the edge of the fabric was folded over the wrong way onto the outside of the shirt and has been sewed that way!,17708,1
17708,"Ridiculously small, so I can't even wear it.",17708,1
17708,It's junk and a complete waste of money.,17708,1
17708,I have asked for a refund.,17708,1
17708,I took a bunch of pictures to add but don't see a way to add them which stinks because you would have to see them to believe how bad this shirt is.,17708,1
17708,Absolute garbage.,17708,1
17709,"I typically wear a medium, and knowing it runs small, ordered an XL- it fits everywhere perfectly except under the arms is awkwardly baggy.",17709,1
17709,I also ordered it in hot pink and it is bright orange.,17709,1
17709,I tried to return it but it came from China and I would have to pay shipping to send it back- which is more than what I paid for the shirt.,17709,1
17710,Don't remember fit because returned.,17710,1
17710,The suede was not soft smooth suede accustomed too.,17710,1
17710,"It was rough, grainy and little material balls",17710,1
17711,Small I'm the bust and large in The body.,17711,1
17711,Returned it for this reason.,17711,1
17711,Personally I think a nursing gown should offer far more space in the bust.,17711,1
17712,Sent back,17712,1
17713,The width is for shorter feet.,17713,1
17713,No one has feet this narrow in size 13.,17713,1
17713,They would be mutants.,17713,1
17713,"How can you justify making someone's life a pain for having to get this and return it when this product was definitely not tried out by the maker, maybe it was on pointy shoes.",17713,1
17713,Lazy people or people with poor attention to detail and poor spacial relations skills out to make a buck.,17713,1
17713,I don't have time to buy bad stuff on Amazon.,17713,1
17713,Longer feet are mostly naturally wider.,17713,1
17713,Make it appropriate!,17713,1
17713,This is no where close to medium width..,17713,1
17713,"So, you got the parts and just threw it together?",17713,1
17713,"Products like this make amazon look bad, not just the maker.",17713,1
17713,I'll try to Macgyver it to stretch my shoes.,17713,1
17714,Thin fabric.,17714,1
17714,Too small.,17714,1

17718,DO NOT BUY.,17718,1
17719,Terrible product.,17719,1
17719,"Nothing like the picture, thought the material would be soft as the picture but it is very silky and feels like a smock material.",17719,1
17720,"it's small, when
you put it on its like wearing a mop,when you cut a big blob of hair sticks up do not ever buy this wig",17720,1
17721,love the design but awful item quality.,17721,1
17721,Worn out after three laundries... Save your money and buy a decent quality items...,17721,1

17725,Wouldn't order again.,17725,1
17726,"I ordered this dress & was super excited about it, but when I got the dress it was completely different from the one I ordered",17726,1
17727,Way thicker than expected.,17727,1
17727,"These are gloves to wear to wash dishes, clean floors...",17727,1
17728,Logo came off right away!,17728,1
17729,Size is too small not according to the measurements,17729,1
17730,Too small and poor quality.,17730,1

17733,I have yet to receive a call or email regarding a return.,17733,1
17734,This is a worthless item.,17734,1
17734,"After reading the reviews, I ordered a size up.",17734,1
17734,You need to order at least two sizes larger than usual to get one that may fit.,17734,1
17734,"Then, none of the button holes are cut through.",17734,1
17734,"Not for the front buttons, not for the pocket buttons, none of them.",17734,1
17734,This is a great item if you want to buy unfinished doll clothes.,17734,1
17735,Took to long still have it in the bag order a new one but its a nice dress,17735,1
17736,After showing up 3 weeks after it said it would arrive.,17736,1
17736,This was a rip off.,17736,1
17736,"The pocket is not real it's just a screen print,  the letters you can barely see, super cheap material for the shirt.",17736,1

17741,Sizes were inaccurate.,17741,1
17741,This dress did not appear as pictured and fits more like a tunic than a dress.,17741,1
17741,This dress was returned.,17741,1
17742,"I usually wear a size small shirt, but after reading the reviews I decided to order a medium.",17742,1
17742,This shirt is skin tight across my back!,17742,1
17742,The front has a weird flap in the front giving it a maternity look.,17742,1
17742,It does not hang like the picture shows.,17742,1
17742,The concept of the shirt is cute but the execution is awkward.,17742,1
17743,This shirt was not the shirt pictured in the image above.,17743,1
17743,When it came in it looked like a toddlers shirt and was a regular tshirt not slouchy at all.,17743,1

17762,Looks nothing like the photo .,17762,1
17763,These shirt stays looked very durable upon receiving them.,17763,1
17763,"I used them at work for a month, (and I work part time in an office) possibly about 10 uses.",17763,1
17763,"The fabric ripped near one of the foot loops, completely.",17763,1
17763,My dress boots cover them the whole time and in no way were they pulled past capacity.,17763,1

17764,Not at all what I expected.,17764,1
17764,It's not as big as a phone.,17764,1
17764,"Approximately 3"" diameter.",17764,1
17764,Tends to overheat so will only charge 3-8 minutes at a time.,17764,1
17764,"So, it'll take a really long time to achieve full charge.",17764,1
17764,"Luckily, it's cheap so I'm not out too much.",17764,1
17765,Doesn't look like the picture.,17765,1

17772,I ordered this as a bridesmaid dress at the last minute and as soon as I opened the package I was panicked.,17772,1
17772,The dress was too big and way too long!,17772,1
17772,And I can't leave out that the bodice was really off and bunched up.,17772,1
17772,I was going to return the dress but quickly found out I wasn't going to be able to order another dress in time.,17772,1
17772,The customer service was great and I was given $40 back to get alterations done.,17772,1
17772,The day of the wedding I was extremely uncomfortable as the dress just did not look good on me at all!,17772,1
17772,Probably because after having the dress on for 5 minutes the thread holding in the bodice broke when I picked up my baby and the bunching fabric bunched even more.,17772,1
17772,I was appalled when I saw how the dress looked in all of the wedding pictures!,17772,1
17772,So much for working my butt off losing all of my pregnancy weight before the wedding just to look like the big version of me.,17772,1
17772,Not flattering on me at all!,17772,1
17772,!,17772,1
17773,Left a terrible rash after one day of wear that took almost two weeks to clear up.,17773,1
17774,I was excited to find a nursing sports bra as it is really hard to feed the baby while wearing a regular sports bra.,17774,1
17774,I took the plunge and bought it and here's why I wish I hadn't.,17774,1
17774,"Despite clearly stating that I could return this item if it didn't fit, this company is extremely restrictive with that policy.",17774,1
17774,"I tried on my bra after a shower, no deodorant, perfume etc.",17774,1
17774,it was too big and just didn't fit right.,17774,1
17774,(See how it pokes out it front in my picture) There was no smaller size to select so I started the return process.,17774,1
17774,"A few weeks later I got the bra back in the mail with a note stating it didn't ""meet their standards"" for return.",17774,1
17774,I looked over it with a decerning eye and nose and couldn't find anything wrong.,17774,1
17774,So- I'm out 25$ and I will never order from them again.,17774,1
17775,The chain broke,17775,1

17778,The necklace came so tangled and with a ton of knots.,17778,1
17778,IT TOOK ME AN HOUR TO UNRAVEL THE NECKLACE.,17778,1
17778,Seriously it seems like they did it on purpose i have no idea how a knot that big is even possible.,17778,1
17778,Almost broke the necklace because the knots were so tight.,17778,1
17778,I was getting so frustrated.,17778,1
17778,This picture was about 30 minutes into trying to untie the knots.,17778,1
17779,"The bracelet clasp was broken when I opened the package, and the ""leather"" part of it is all bent.",17779,1

17781,"Leather looking part, was more vinyl",17781,1

17787,It was so small that I had to give it away to a friend .,17787,1
17787,I could hardly get it over my head.,17787,1
17787,I reordered another design in a men's size and that fits.,17787,1
17788,These were very low quality and came with a rip in them.,17788,1
17788,I'm a size 6 in womens and they were impossibly small.,17788,1

17856,"I read the reviews but didn't know by ""sizes run small"" they ment ""sizes closer to children sizes"".",17856,1
17856,The fact that 'big woman plus size' is in the name of the item just adds insult to injury.,17856,1

17872,These are so insanely hard to get in and out of your ears.,17872,1
17872,I actually had to go get one removed professionally at a local shop.,17872,1
17872,Nothing like getting your ear stretched up by more tapers just to get a too flared plug out of your ear lobe.,17872,1
17872,I tried everything to get it out even like a button.,17872,1
17872,And I also want to make it clear that I have been at my size for about a year now...,17872,1

17876,I am typically a 6 in jeans and wear small shirts.,17876,1
17876,This product runs very very small I am annoyed at the inconvenience it has been.,17876,1
17877,I was very dissappointed in the size.,17877,1
17877,Buy 2 times larger than you usually wear.,17877,1
17877,The fit is awkward,17877,1
17878,It was a totally different sweatshirt I got a black and gray one and the hood was blue and the outside was black and there are these ugly buttons that go up the neck,17878,1
17879,Bought this as a replacement for the original case that came with my Ray Bans.,17879,1
17879,This product is definitely fake.,17879,1

17881,So wrong to not have accurate sizing charts with the clothing.,17881,1
17881,So glad I have Prime for free shipping on things like this that don't fit because of way-off size charts!,17881,1
17881,!,17881,1
17882,"I typically wear medium sized shirts and  because this was intended to be worn at waist level I figured the one size fit would be alright, but I couldn't get it over my hips and it was difficult to get it on over my head also.",17882,1
17882,When it was on it was completely see through and even when I replaced the built-in slip with one of my own it was still uncomfortable and unfashionable,17882,1
17883,The material is cheaper and thinner than I expected for a $20 skirt.,17883,1
17883,"It was also short on me (5'9"") so instead of folding it over, to get the length right I have to use the ""fold over"" as part of the skirt which makes the seams emphasize my hips and tummy oddly.",17883,1

17928,I returned this dress.,17928,1
17928,The material was scratchy and the dress runs very small.,17928,1
17929,I've worn them one day and the zipper is already broken.,17929,1
17929,They really aren't wind resistance as stated.,17929,1
17929,They don't keep your hands warm either.,17929,1
17929,I am pretty disappointed.,17929,1

17930,Awful.,17930,1
17930,Color faded immediately after first wearing.,17930,1
17930,Complete waste of money.,17930,1

17932,Sleeves were size 43.,17932,1
17932,Extremely large.,17932,1
17932,There is no option to select sleeve size.,17932,1
17932,"In a real Polo store this is perfectly possible, I suggest to let customer select sleeve size.",17932,1
17932,I ordered another one two weeks later and same thing happened.,17932,1
17932,Not a good experience.,17932,1
17932,I will have to have shirts adjusted and to asume expenses,17932,1
17933,For horrible and the quality of material was awful I washed it before actually attempting to wear it and it completely fell apart,17933,1
17934,Cheaply made doesnt look like the picture.,17934,1
17935,This s*** is very misreprentsented and ugly.,17935,1
17935,Besides being way too small it did not look like the shirt I ordered.,17935,1
17935,Fabric was raggy also.,17935,1
17936,RECEIVED the WRONG ITEM!!!,17936,1
17936,I WANT the TOP!!!!,17936,1
17936,Made we wait for many days n this is what I get?!?!??!?!!!!,17936,1

17937,These are men's sweatpants.,17937,1
17937,I have returned one set although I washed one pair to see if it would shrink.,17937,1
17937,There is no way they would fit a woman unless she was siz feet tall.,17937,1
17938,It was a waste of money it didn't fit my phone for being the correct case for the phone I have.,17938,1
17939,Too small and cheezy material like a store bought  Halloween costume.,17939,1
17940,This jacket was an absolute joke and I feel stupid for even buying it.,17940,1
17941,It did not look like it was supposed to.,17941,1
17941,The tool was really puffy and didn't lay nicely.,17941,1

17943,First time I've ordered and a handmade dress was this poor.,17943,1
17944,very ugly unable to wear it ..cheap material ...,17944,1
17945,Absolutely awful.,17945,1
17945,"They were tiny (I'm a size 6 and they didn't come past my thighs), they came with runs already, the fabric is just cheap translucent pantyhose, and the bows are just sewn on to the back of the legs.",17945,1
17945,There aren't any cut outs and the bows are just two loops stuck together.,17945,1
17945,"They are not stockings, they are full on pantyhose that are attached at the middle and (somewhat) cover the rear.",17945,1
17945,It looks like a 12 year old's first sewing project.,17945,1
17945,If I could give 0 stars I would.,17945,1
17946,Had to return!,17946,1
17947,I love the style of this bag.,17947,1
17947,They style is great I just wish the zippers worked better.,17947,1
17947,They are low quality zippers and don't close at all.,17947,1
17947,The big compartment zipper works ok and so does the lower zipper on the front side(although I'm careful not to over-stuff).,17947,1
17947,The zipper on the top is the one that does not close at all; im so disappointed because the zipper started to malfunction just a week into owning the bag.,17947,1
17947,I thought i would just deal with it but i cant.,17947,1
17947,Since the zipper does not close that compartment just hangs wide open so I cant put anything in there because it falls off.,17947,1
17947,"4

Also the bag is not water proof at all.",17947,1
17947,I got caught in the rain the other day and all my stuff on the top got wet.,17947,1

17957,Really i don't like all.,17957,1

18165,False advertising!!,18165,1
18165,!,18165,1
18166,1 year later it is all torn and it's been lightly used.,18166,1
18166,"CHEAP QUALITY, the pockets are undone and the zipper is detached.",18166,1
18166,All I ever put in this bag was my breast milk after work.,18166,1
18166,I'd store in freezer and simply use for transport back and forth.,18166,1
18167,I ordered these in a size 7.5 and i wear a 7.,18167,1
18167,They were too small so I then ordered an 8 and they were the same exact size!,18167,1
18167,Very unhappy!,18167,1
18167,!I would not recommend these at all!,18167,1
18168,"To small (short) and it's very flowy, so I felt like I was draped in a curtain.",18168,1
18168,Made me look even bigger,18168,1
18169,Zero stars,18169,1
18170,Thought it was cheaply made.,18170,1
18170,Not really silver.,18170,1
18171,"The fit on the mittens is nice and tight, doesn't fall off but there issue with the actually material it is shreading and doesn't seem to be safe for our child.",18171,1
18171,If this is a quality control issue please contact me as I would like to try another set.,18171,1
18172,Too small I can't wear it,18172,1
18173,O Stars.,18173,1
18173,The quality of this dress is horrible and the stitching is all off.,18173,1
18174,"They where not the right size, ordered a 36 measured them and they where a 30.",18174,1
18174,Button came off when you opened then to try them on.,18174,1
18174,"Not winter fleece, more like a light cotton lining.",18174,1
18175,Not what it looks like in the picture,18175,1
18176,I got this for my daughter for school 1 week into school and the back strap is already ripped.,18176,1
18177,I ordered a 3X.,18177,1
18177,I gave it to my niece who is a size 8 and it fits her perfectly.,18177,1
18177,The size chart was nowhere near accurate.,18177,1
18177,"I suppose you get what you pay for, ordering anything manufactured from China.",18177,1

18179,"This shirt is pure crap, a total waste of money.",18179,1
18179,To top it off it shrunk and became disfigured after one wash,18179,1
18180,I hate it.,18180,1
18180,I looks nothing like the picture.,18180,1
18180,I can see my hand right through the material.,18180,1
18180,Not worth it.,18180,1
18181,VERY poor quality.,18181,1
18182,Poor quality.,18182,1
18183,Women deserve underwear that fits as expected and is decently designed and constructed.,18183,1
18183,Misogyny towards fat women is especially insidious and egregious.,18183,1
18183,These underpants are an act of hate.,18183,1
18183,"In a size 14, these underpants are supposed to correspond to hips 60-63.5"", or a dress size 34-36.",18183,1
18183,"However, they are so absurdly small that they might only fit a panty size 9, equivalent to a dress size 14-16, with hips 45-46.5"".",18183,1
18183,"Worse, unlike most cotton jersey or interlock panties, the strangely stiff and scratchy fabric has little or no crosswise stretch.",18183,1
18183,"The crotch piece is about 1.5"" wide, which would hardly be wide enough for panties for an eight year old girl, much less the dimensions of a plus size woman.",18183,1
18183,Nor is there enough length for a full cut panty.,18183,1
18183,"The manufacturers seem to think that as we get bigger, we do so only in width and not in length.",18183,1
18183,They seem to think that large women have big backsides and completely flat tummies.,18183,1
18183,"The result is a supposedly full cut panty that is actually more like a tiny, wierdly fitting bikini with a waistband far south of the anatomical waist and inadequate coverage front and back.",18183,1
18183,The quality of plus size underpants has become worse and worse.,18183,1
18183,I give up.,18183,1
18183,I'l just sew my own.,18183,1
18184,this was shown as a jr's size I received a toddler size at best!,18184,1
18185,"It was to small, poor quality material, few holes and because of it coming from overseas they could not give me a refund.",18185,1
18186,Should be sold for a child .,18186,1
18186,Nice quality to bad that weren't made for adults...,18186,1
18186,Extremely misleading !,18186,1
18186,!!,18186,1
18186,So i gave them away to my neighbors new born .,18186,1
18186,She can wear them when her ears get pierced.,18186,1
18186,That's how small they are..Really,18186,1
18187,"The bust was too small, I'm normally a large, 36D, I ordered the XL to use as a coverup and it was way too small in the chest, fit like a small or medium on top.",18187,1
18188,These tops are WAY smaller than expected.,18188,1
18189,Pres of co..wear dress shirts and ties every day.,18189,1
18189,Shirt fit great...but wrinkled fast than any shirt Ive ever seen.,18189,1
18189,Will keep for only special occasions,18189,1
18190,Nothing like the picture.,18190,1
18190,A long piece of flimsy material.,18190,1
18191,The backpack is very beautiful but the quality is HORRIBLE.,18191,1
18191,All the flowers from the zippers broke within 6-8 weeks and now 8 weeks of use later the main zipper finally broke.,18191,1
18191,The backpack is falling apart everywhere and school has only been in session for about 8 weeks.,18191,1
18191,Very disappointed.,18191,1
18191,I just had to buy another backpack only two months into the school year.,18191,1
18192,Comes in bigger than expected,18192,1
18193,Too small,18193,1
18194,I ordered this color thinking I would get some mellon/creamy colors.,18194,1
18194,I received the day glow version of all of these colors.,18194,1
18194,Think highlighters with some navy and not attractive at all.,18194,1
18194,The picture is horribly inaccurate and very misleading.,18194,1
18195,"glass lens popped out just after one time use, low quality material and assembly.",18195,1
18195,very poor quality,18195,1
18196,I thought these were cute when I ordered them.,18196,1
18196,"When they arrived, they were a very big 9-12 months (which is good for us considering our daughter is in the top percentiles and most clothing doesn't last very long).",18196,1
18196,"The body suits came one a hanger and each shoulder had two plastic ties (imagine the plastic ties you find on clothes that usually have the tag on them, but four of those on each body suit).",18196,1
18196,"As I started looking/cutting off the plastic ties, each tie left a large hole in the clothing.",18196,1
18196,"Much to my dismay, each body suit now had 4 large holes in them!!",18196,1
18196,They are somewhat hidden but I am very disappointed in their packaging and the damage it leaves on the clothes.,18196,1
18196,I wouldn't buy this from them until they correct this problem.,18196,1
18197,"Very sheer, not as pictured",18197,1
18198,Sizing information is way off.,18198,1
18198,Very pretty print.,18198,1
18199,Don't buy if you're looking for pink.,18199,1
18199,They're not pink.,18199,1
18200,Earrings are very cute but I cannot wear them.,18200,1
18200,When they arrived the posts were already broken off the back.,18200,1
18200,May try to glue them back on but if it doesnt work will just suck it up as a loss.,18200,1
18200,Not worth sending back for the price.,18200,1
18200,Would have been super cute if the posts were actually connected.,18200,1
18201,I ordered two dresses.,18201,1
18201,One for myself and the other for my mother.,18201,1
18201,"She received her dress, I did not get my dress.",18201,1
18201,Still emailing back and forth with them.,18201,1
18202,Don't waste your money on this dress.,18202,1
18202,The design across the bust flattens you out.,18202,1
18202,The opening of the square neck area is much larger than in the photo making it feel like it is barely sitting on your shoulders.,18202,1
18202,It runs extremely small.,18202,1
18202,"I ordered a size medium, I usually wear a size small.",18202,1
18202,Also was not happy with the shipper.,18202,1

18204,Bad quality,18204,1
18205,Do NOT buy it if you are bigger than a size 12.,18205,1
18205,I ordered an XL and I normally am a size 16.,18205,1
18205,It fits like a shirt.,18205,1
18205,Which is what I will probably use it for.,18205,1
18206,"Much smaller than it appears, thought this would be tote size.",18206,1
18206,Not even close.,18206,1
18207,LOve the ring but half size to big and it can't be sized because of the titanium it was a gift and the size is wrong so I'm upset don't know if I can get new one and exchange this or not,18207,1

18300,"The fit is ok for the size ordered, but the style or shape of the ""sweater"" is completely different than shown.",18300,1
18300,"As far as the material, it doesn't feel like a sweater... it feels more like a polyester sweatshirt without the fleece inside.",18300,1
18300,"I would be surprised if it's 100% cotton, I see no tags inside for materials.",18300,1
18300,"If you are looking for the sleek, fine gauge sweater like the picture suggests, don't order this!",18300,1

18316,It is actually a cute dress I am a size 8 wear a medium usually but with these Asian sizing options I always order an x-large and it fits well.,18316,1
18316,As I tried it on and looked in the full length mirror I got grossed out by a white chalky stain and immediately Monica lewinsky came to mind.,18316,1

18342,Would not recommend it.,18342,1
18343,Lousy quality,18343,1
18344,The only problem is that should have been manufactured in a greater length so as to allow greater flexibility in the ability to use on glasses with longer length at thesame time being able to cut shorter for frames that requires short ones.,18344,1

18396,"The inside seams do not want to stay in, strange to say but every time I wore this, the neck hole seam, flipped out and the bottom seams flipped up.",18396,1
18396,Even with ironing it did not help.,18396,1
18396,Would not suggest ordering due to this.,18396,1
18396,It was very uncomfortable to deal with.,18396,1
18397,its a square thing... Im regret that I bought this blouse... the quality of the fabric its 100% polyester.,18397,1

18398,I'm not happy with this waste of money.,18398,1
18399,"I ordered camel color, extra large and received red color, large.",18399,1
18399,"Regardless of large or extra large, this will not be a good fit for me.",18399,1
18399,It is too light weight to be a true coat and seems more like a costume.,18399,1
18399,I am returning it.,18399,1
18400,"This is made from extremely cheap material, think the silky polyester stuff they make costumes out of.",18400,1
18400,The breast pocket is fake so if you use pocket squares this will no work for you.,18400,1
18400,All around a complete mess.,18400,1
18401,This would make a great costume piece!,18401,1
18401,I purchased this as a swimsuit top for summer.,18401,1
18401,It did not work out.,18401,1
18401,There is no support or structure what so ever.,18401,1
18401,the cups/shells don't form to your body.,18401,1
18401,"They're just sit there flat, and stay flat, yet everything is flimsy.",18401,1
18401,I generally wear a medium in tops and 36b.,18401,1
18401,I ordered a size large and it fits a little small.,18401,1

18402,"By the time I tried to return the product, the 30 day return period had just passed.",18402,1
18402,It would be nice if we were able to exchange since it hadn't fit as expected.,18402,1
18402,I suggest buyers go larger in size than they think since you'll grow into it over time.,18402,1
18403,"Size chart is wrong, I ordered a large and it wouldn't fit a child... Not worth retuning it because it only cost $1.",18403,1
18403,"My advice, don't waste the dollar",18403,1

18417,"The crotch, even if I have it pulled all the way ""in"" is too short so the back gets tight and won't lay flat on my back, it goes from my butt diagonally to my neck and sticks out.",18417,1
18417,The shoulders fit and everything else is good...,18417,1
18417,It just isn't long enough for my torso which is weird because I'm only 5'1.,18417,1

18443,They're made out of like styrofoam or something hard like that and molded to fit a very strange shaped breast.,18443,1
18443,They just look like cones honestly.,18443,1
18443,The straps on the top AND the clasp are ridiculous too.,18443,1
18443,The clasp makes it impossible to put this swimsuit on without putting it on backwards because you have to actually see it to clasp it together.,18443,1

18456,I returned them because two people said they were made in America yet they were made in China.,18456,1
18456,"Who knows, they might keep your hands up down to 20 degrees but I prefer to buy American made and these weren't advertised correctly.",18456,1

18511,This product is what is described unfortunately the mask ripped to the top of the head the first time it was used.,18511,1
18511,"Not worth your money even for a one time use im so disappointed that my son barely put it on and took it off with a huge gash where he can no longer use, which is the point of the purchase.",18511,1
18512,Junk,18512,1
18513,The chain on this pendant was kinked in several places.,18513,1
18513,What a disappointment.,18513,1
18514,Sucks !,18514,1
18514,!!,18514,1
18514,Straight rubber,18514,1
18515,TOO SMALL... now paying $6.00 for a return shipment.,18515,1
18515,my son is 3 and these are too snug.,18515,1
18516,No stars!,18516,1
18516,Poorly made.,18516,1
18516,2 pairs broke when opening to wear.,18516,1
18516,Have not bothered with remaining pairs.,18516,1
18516,A waste of money.,18516,1
18517,I returned it.,18517,1
18517,The material made the bag stink.,18517,1
18517,"The brand on the emblem was stamped twice, not in the same place so it looked blurry.",18517,1
18517,Honestly this felt and sounded like diaper bag material.,18517,1
18517,Not what I was expecting or wanting.,18517,1
18518,It fits really weird.,18518,1
18518,I thought it would either be loose where the material is soft and allows airflow or it would either be a tight fit that wicks away the sweat.... but it's neither.,18518,1
18518,It's awkward :(,18518,1
18519,I usually wear a medium but ordered a small due to other reviews saying it came in a bit big.,18519,1
18519,"The small is still too big for me, it hugs my body but not tight enough and the straps puff out around my arms.",18519,1
18519,Plus there were a few string hanging off of it when it arrived.,18519,1
18519,"The neck is not very deep like in the picture either, shows no cleavage at all for me.",18519,1
18519,I made sure it had the Kwok Boutique tag on it to ensure it wasn't a fake.,18519,1
18519,I'm just glad I got for my Halloween costume and not something important so I can still use it.,18519,1
18519,Wouldn't recommend buying it.,18519,1
18520,"After reading the reviews and trying to figure out what size to get, I got a 6X.",18520,1
18520,I wear a size 18 pants and extra-large shirt and have large bust.,18520,1
18520,I was looking for a bathing suit that would cover my extra large size.,18520,1
18520,But this bathing suit was a terrible fit.,18520,1
18520,My boobs always felt exposed and I had to constantly look down to make sure that they didn't pop out because  there was no coverage.,18520,1
18520,"I agree with others that it was cheaply made, parts of the design ripped.",18520,1
18520,I finally invested in and INC bathing suit that fits well and better quality.,18520,1
18520,And it's not even more expensive.,18520,1
18520,I would honestly pass on this bathing suit and go for an INC one.,18520,1
18520,There is a blue one that I got instead that fits perfectly and provides coverage  in the bust area.,18520,1
18520,It seems to be made for people with large busts.,18520,1
18520,I only wish that it would cover my thighs but I'm just going to invest in board shorts to wear over instead of a bathing suit with a skirt.,18520,1
18520,Walk away,18520,1
18521,These tops are very cheaply made.,18521,1
18521,Crepe-like material.,18521,1
18521,Runs about 2 sizes small IF you want it to fit like it does on the model.,18521,1
18521,"Wanted to return, but has been DENIED!",18521,1
18521,AOSH - the seller DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS.,18521,1
18521,I think if it is known that a SELLER does not accept returns then it should be stated in the product information.,18521,1
18522,Made for smaller legs than mine.,18522,1
18523,I ordered an XL and normally wear a size 12.,18523,1
18523,I couldn't fit even get the shirt on.,18523,1
18524,The wig was not in a bag and was frizzy.,18524,1
18524,Looked like it had been worn.,18524,1
18524,"Smiffy's wigs are great products for the price, but this was not wearable.",18524,1
18525,These look like something out a cracker Jack box.,18525,1
18525,The charms are the size of my thumb.,18525,1
18526,I returned it as it was hard to set and it uses expensive ECR2025 batteries.,18526,1
18526,I exchanged it for a cheaper model that plugs in.,18526,1
18527,Top part fit great.,18527,1

18532,"The material was thin and cheap, I received the jumpsuit and with one of the back straps not attached it was wayyyyy to short.",18532,1

18551,I figured ordering a larger size would be longer.,18551,1
18551,"I am 5'3, and my butt was showing.",18551,1
18551,I wouldn't order from this company again.,18551,1

18552,I was sitting at work and felt something fall down my shirt and low and behold it was this necklace!!,18552,1
18552,Very very unhappy.,18552,1
18552,I would expect this from something that costs $5 or $10 but not $20.,18552,1
18552,Something that costs $20 shouldn't break within the same 24 hours in which you recieved it.,18552,1
18552,"The pendant itself IS beautiful, but now I'm going to have to spend more money and buy another chain.",18552,1
18552,"Very inconvient and annoying, would have expected it to ATLEAST last more than a week.",18552,1

18766,"My understanding was that ""Italian"" sterling silver did not turn black.",18766,1
18766,"I have a 1.2mm chain of Italian sterling silver bought from a reputable jewelry store; I wore that chain continuously for 6 months, without a hint of tarnishing.",18766,1
18766,"Although I wanted something thicker, I will go back to wearing that older chain.",18766,1
18766,"If there is something I can do to improve the look and enduring shine of this chain, I would like to know.",18766,1

18944,"The royal blue is vibrant and  pretty, but I had to pull this top down rather than it falling loosely as it should.",18944,1
18944,"It delineated every bump and bulge, and possibly made it look like I have even more, lol!",18944,1
18944,The strap across the back of the neck doesn't lie flat and is an added annoyance.,18944,1
18944,"I really wish companies would get the sizing right on these swing tops and they are great if they fit, and I'd buy one in every color.",18944,1
18945,Sized incorrectly.,18945,1
18945,I could not even get this over my head.,18945,1
18945,The quality is horrible as well.,18945,1
18946,Broke shortly after purchasing,18946,1
18947,what is with all the glitter?,18947,1
18947,I can not wear or keep this in my home.,18947,1
18947,it does not say it has loose glitter all over it.,18947,1
18947,don't waste your money.,18947,1
18948,Returned the Prayer Shawl.,18948,1
18949,Lace holder broke after 3 uses.,18949,1
18949,This is cheap and I wish I could get a new pair for free.,18949,1
18950,"I WEARS A SIZE 16-18 REGULAR AND ORDERED FROM THE SIZE CHART  XL WICH STATES THAT IT FITS SIZE 16-18,  THE DRESS IS WAAAAY  TOO SMALL.",18950,1

18951,ladies please do not buy these!,18951,1
18951,"its true what they say, you get what you pay for.",18951,1
18951,"they are not comfortable, hardly stretch in the right places, ride up, and i have developed a serious rash/reaction to these along my bra line.",18951,1
18951,ive never broken out along my back and under breasts from anything before!!!,18951,1
18951,"i wish i hadnt washed all of them before trying one out, so very disappointing and wish i could return!",18951,1
18952,It looks horrible it looks like an old ladies night gown,18952,1
18953,Way smaller than I thought it would be.,18953,1
18953,Not worth it.,18953,1
18954,"I thought this bathing suit was going to be so nice, but instead it was bad quality.",18954,1
18954,"The bottoms fit, but the top was way to small and you could tell that the threading was coming undone.",18954,1
18954,In all honesty this was a total waste of money.,18954,1
18955,Ordered a lady's medium and it looked and fit like a youth medium.,18955,1
18955,This was a gift for my son's girlfriend so he was disappointed.,18955,1
18956,"The shirt is really cute, however, it is really, really, small.",18956,1
18956,The shirt is wider through the shoulders but it narrows drastically at the hips.,18956,1
18956,"I really wished this shirt fit, but it doesn't and probably never will!",18956,1
18956,The fabric is kine of like silky and seems to be staticy.,18956,1
18957,Waste of money cheap and  ugly,18957,1
18958,Very strong paint/glue smell!!,18958,1
18958,It's overwhelming!,18958,1
18959,"Cheap looking, poor material & too small",18959,1
18960,"The quality, the strap is already broken, athe material is peeling, zipper never worked because it get caught in the cheap lining and I purchased it less than a my ago.",18960,1
18960,I am returning this item.,18960,1
18960,I don't have money to throw in the garbage.,18960,1
18961,It said size 4..,18961,1
18961,I think they meant 4 ppl could fit in it!,18961,1
18962,Too small.,18962,1
18962,I ordered larger than I normally do and it's still too small,18962,1
18963,I wish I could have worn it but it was too small I wear a 16 and it did not fit ....,18963,1
18963,I was disappointed because I loved the dress.,18963,1
18964,Looks nothing like the picture.,18964,1
18964,The pendant is about the size of a quarter if not smaller and it's on a 16 inch chain.,18964,1
18964,"The back also has black marks all over it and it's very flat, not rounded like it looks in the picture.",18964,1
18964,I'm very disappointed.,18964,1
18965,Cute little hat but arrived in AN ENVELOPE!,18965,1
18965,"Needless to say, I doubt it ever comes back to its original shape.",18965,1
18966,Smells like gasoline,18966,1
18967,He did not like them,18967,1
18968,There were three serious kinks in the chain when I received this chain.,18968,1
18968,"After 20 minutes of fumbling, twisting, and turning I couldn't get two of the kinks out, and one of the kinks had a cracked link.",18968,1
18968,They must not believe in quality control.,18968,1
18968,"I mean I know it's a cheaper chain, but I expected to get a wearable one.",18968,1
18969,"Looks good and fits well, but it is advertised here on Amazon as ""100% cotton throughout"".",18969,1
18969,"Label says otherwise: ""Body: 100% Cotton, Liner: 100% polyester"".",18969,1
18969,"I ONLY bought this, as I was trying to find a bathing suit absent of polyester.",18969,1
18969,Particularly the liner.,18969,1
18969,This is not that bathing suit.,18969,1
18970,"Terrible product, I am 5'6 and it was super short.. it fits my 10 year old daughter...",18970,1
18971,If i could have given 0 stars i would have.,18971,1
18971,Maybe I didn't pay attention to where it was shipped from but I order XL Shirtand the tag said is was an XL.,18971,1
18971,"But it looked and fit like a xl shirt for a child, which would make no sense because this shirt is clearly for adults.",18971,1
18971,Not to mention it was ripped when it got here.,18971,1
18972,Do not buy these!,18972,1
18972,I purchased for my grandson and he broke out in a terrible rash from the elastic waistband.,18972,1
18972,Don't waste your money!,18972,1
18973,Too uncomfortable to wear with any shoes.,18973,1
18973,I don't know how people wear these.,18973,1
18973,We really wanted them to work.,18973,1
18974,WOW... SIZING CHART WAAAAAY OFF.. MEN'S 5X BARELY FITS MY GIRLFRIEND WHO WEARS A WOMEN'S 1X,18974,1
18975,It is scratchy and irritates my skin.,18975,1
18975,I can't wear it unless I put a shirt on underneath.,18975,1
18975,It is also very see through.,18975,1
18976,shrunk into a children's shirt after being washed.,18976,1
18977,It is too large for my hand and there is no way to shorten it.,18977,1
18978,It looks so undone.,18978,1
18979,"Bottoms fit true to size, where as the top is SOOOOOO small.",18979,1
18979,Would not recommend.,18979,1
18980,It doesn't Worth the price,18980,1
18981,"This dress is not the quality pictured, the material is very thin.",18981,1
18981,"The design on the front is printed, not stitched.",18981,1
18981,The belt does not match the design colors.,18981,1
18982,I will never buy another swimsuit through Amazon again.,18982,1
18982,The sizes are not accurate and the material is not good....very thin.,18982,1
18982,This is the second one I bought and am so disappointed.,18982,1
18982,"I bought them at the same time, but they arrived months after I bought them and at different times.",18982,1
18982,I really should have looked at the reviews....lesson learned.,18982,1
18982,Agree with the person who said it is not worth it to send it back because you have to pay for the return shipping and you will spend more than it's worth.,18982,1
18982,Will be donating the swimsuits to someone who can use them.,18982,1
18982,I bought an XL because I am a size 16 and it was a joke.,18982,1
18982,XL is made for someone who is maybe a 10.,18982,1
18982,I would NOT reccomend this purchase.,18982,1
18983,Did not fit as expected at all,18983,1
18984,I bought this for my daughter as a birthday present.,18984,1
18984,She loved the look of it and immediately put her Bible in it to bring to church the next day.,18984,1
18984,She hadn't even gotten out of the car before the handle ripped out at the seam and she was just holding it.,18984,1
18984,Nothing extreme like swinging it around (like she has been known to do!),18984,1
18984,Terrible terrible quality!,18984,1
18984,"I forgot to return it in time, so I'll try sewing it back together, but we were very disappointed in it!",18984,1
18985,This was nothing more than a piece of cut off fabric.,18985,1
18985,Could have gotten in the Walmart fabric section prob for .99 a yard.,18985,1
18986,This purchase alone has resulted in my ceasing to purchase anymore clotjing via Amazon.,18986,1
18986,Waste of money.,18986,1
18986,The pants are completely see through.,18986,1
18986,Good for nothing but lounging/pajamas.,18986,1
18986,Horrible.,18986,1
18987,Cheap material buyers be aware,18987,1
18988,"So they fit, they're nice enough... but I use these pants for work.",18988,1
18988,These pants are noticeably thinner than the other three pair of the exact same Carhartt pants I have.,18988,1
18988,I have jeans thicker than what was shipped to me .,18988,1
18988,"I'm not sure why you're buying Carhartt, but I'm buying for durable work pants.",18988,1
18988,"What I received are cheap thin ""canvas"" pants which read 100% cotton made in Mexico.",18988,1
18988,"I understand ""canvas"" is now double woven cotton but these pants feel like gap khaki's which are very thin compared to all of my other Carhartt pants.",18988,1
18988,I actually have Dickies thicker than these.,18988,1
18988,I'd avoid these unless you are aiming at some sort of trendy hard worker look.,18988,1
18989,Didn't like the material,18989,1
18990,It looks exactly like a ribbed tank top dress.,18990,1
18990,It is NOT fitted at all and definitely does not look like the picture.,18990,1
18991,"I did not order this, at first it was showing a heart bracelet now a necklace I don't want this give me what I paid for a heart bracelet!",18991,1
18992,"Well, this photo online looks great.",18992,1
18992,However this is not what you are getting.,18992,1
18992,I am not getting into quality at all.,18992,1
18992,"These Halloween decorations are always cheaply made and low quality for the most part, so this sad one star has nothing to do with that.",18992,1
18992,The simple fact that this is not what you are getting is what is frustrating.,18992,1
18992,See attached photos to get an idea of what you are really getting.,18992,1
18992,Also I will be returning it since this is not what I wanted or ordered.,18992,1
18993,The shields don't fit and the barbell is super short..I am happy I didn't pay more then I did...,18993,1
18993,I can barely put my pinky in the little shield and I have small pinkies..,18993,1
18993,It goes right above my nail,18993,1
18994,Tight fitting no stretch,18994,1
18995,I wanted to put zero stars but i have to put at least one.,18995,1
18995,The product arrived without the glasses.,18995,1
18995,Do I need to say more?!,18995,1
18995,We where only on vacation on USA and we had to go back so I couldn't return them.,18995,1
18995,And now I'm in Mexico with a simple cover for iphone,18995,1
18996,great shoe but too small,18996,1
18997,"if I can,  i put 0 for this prodect.",18997,1
18998,"Poor quality, weak frame and bad construction.",18998,1
18999,Even cheaper than it is inexpensive.,18999,1
18999,Don't waste your money on this one.,18999,1
19000,Straight GARBAGE.,19000,1
19001,I remember asking for a silver necklace not gold.,19001,1
19002,This style wasn't what I expected.,19002,1
19003,Its ok.,19003,1
19003,The picture is very misleading.,19003,1
19003,It will cover your entire breast so it looks more like you are wearing a sports bra!,19003,1
19003,The hook on the back does not stay in place so the top will come off at anytime (NOT GOOD!!),19003,1
19003,bottom is big and gives you the diaper booty!!,19003,1
19003,Not a good look!,19003,1
19003,WIll not buy again!,19003,1
19004,Severely disappointed- the hat actually seems like material is good quality but it's crooked!,19004,1
19004,I needed this for a party this weekend so I'm just counting my losses- the sailor hat is at least good quality- very disappointed that they obviously don't check the products they send,19004,1
19005,"Way to big , not the real size i order 3-6months and it looked like for a 3 yr",19005,1
19006,"I am 5'5"", 150 lbs, 36C and dress size 8.",19006,1
19006,I ordered this bath suit in an XL and it was WAYYY too small.,19006,1
19006,The triangular top barely covered my boobs and the length of the bath suit was too short...,19006,1
19007,No what expected is very poor quality breaks easily and is a pain to get it out of the roll.,19007,1
19008,"Wrong size, had a small sticker on the label showing 4XL but XL was on the label.",19008,1
19008,"Emblem was pink, not red.",19008,1
19008,"They kept giving me delivery dates that we wrong, arrived far later than promised and was too small to beat it all",19008,1
19009,i don't have tthe time or patiance to deal with idiots  disepectful  Drop these idiots xl and 2xl measured equal to a small  I HATE THIS,19009,1
19010,terrible quality.,19010,1
19011,"Very bad product, size is for child or should be",19011,1
19012,This skirt is junk.,19012,1
19012,"It's made in China, which you won't know when you are ordering it, because it's made to look like a US company.",19012,1
19012,"It was three sizes too small, not the right color and not at all like the picture.",19012,1
19012,Buyer beware.,19012,1
19012,"It has numerous pleats where it was gathered at the waist instead of lying flat against your stomach, so it poofs out and doesn't have the nice, flattering look of the picture.",19012,1
19012,"I never have luck ordering from China because the quality is so poor and things run very, very small, so I vowed to never order clothes from China off of Amazon again.",19012,1
19012,"When you land on this skirt, it will look like it's made in the US, but it is most certainly not.",19012,1
19012,I should have known something was up when it took three weeks to arrive.,19012,1
19013,Not like the picture.,19013,1
19014,Keeps time poorly and fits awfully.,19014,1
19015,It didn't fit,19015,1
19016,These suitcases are horrible.,19016,1
19016,I had one suitcase zipper rip after the first trip I used it.,19016,1
19016,I spoke Customer Service and they sent a replacement.,19016,1
19016,"On my 1st international with new one, the zipper ripped again and this time the handle came off.",19016,1
19016,The airlines had to tape up the bag because the zipper ripped open all the way around - and the suitcases where well below weight limit.,19016,1
19016,These are just awful- would not recommend to anyone!,19016,1
19017,Was not sized correctly!,19017,1
19018,Too thick .,19018,1
19018,ugly on my finger.,19018,1
19018,returned it.,19018,1
19019,I used this on my recent trip for the first time.,19019,1
19019,"During the first day of travel, the zipper on the front pocket started messing up and wouldn't close.",19019,1
19019,It worked off and on but overall I was really disappointed in the quality of this product.,19019,1
19020,After one time and first washed the branding logo pealed.,19020,1
19020,Very disappointed with this product,19020,1
19021,Way too large.,19021,1
19021,Ordered women's but think received mens.,19021,1
19021,You can almost put 2 legs in one side.,19021,1
19022,"They are not made well, hard to open and not worth the price.",19022,1
19022,I am returning both of them.,19022,1
19022,Only gave 1 star because rating posting required a star.,19022,1
19023,What I received  was not as pictured!!!,19023,1
19023,It was so short...it came to my beltline.,19023,1
19024,I would give a zero star if I could.,19024,1
19024,The ring was missing!!,19024,1
19024,They didn't even put it in the box!!!!,19024,1
19024,Who does that!,19024,1
19024,?,19024,1
19025,"I ordered a 5xl, I am a size 22 my sister is a size 14 it fit her well",19025,1
19026,Broke 3rd day of wearing it and so did the other ones I bought my friends.,19026,1
19027,I don't usually give one star on any product I buy but this one is just awful in most ways.,19027,1
19027,It's cute enough but completely sheer.,19027,1
19027,It's very boxy.,19027,1
19027,"Also, I'm 5'3 and 125lbs and I was asked if I was pregnant...I'm not!",19027,1
19028,"This dress is ok, not the best quality material but good enough for everyday use, just fits too big",19028,1
19029,Doesn't fit will return,19029,1
19030,Not even close to size ordered.,19030,1
19030,Chinese.,19030,1
19031,Its Gold.,19031,1
19031,And not as turquoise as this pic!,19031,1
19031,More Green with GOLD :(,19031,1
19032,The light does not shine where advertised (see picture).,19032,1
19032,*Update June 14* The seller contacted me about a month after my order arrived to offer me another ring box at no charge (they saw this review).,19032,1
19032,"While it was a respectable effort, I had already proposed and no longer required a correctly functioning ring box.",19032,1
19032,"I believe that if I contacted the seller directly, this situation would have been rectified appropriately, in a timely manner.",19032,1
19032,"*Update June 14*

When the box arrived it needed a little TLC to get it properly aligned because one side of the hinges came up and caused the box to open unevenly.",19032,1
19032,"A few seconds later, it was good.",19032,1
19032,"I was nervous about the material of the box because it said ""rubber,"" but it's definitely better than leather!",19032,1
19032,The rubber isn't sticky or cheap and it will definitely allow me to handle it properly when I go to propose versus a slippery leather.,19032,1
19032,The light works but it's definitely off.,19032,1
19032,"You can tell by the picture that the light shines forward, blinding the person who's supposed to be looking at the ring!",19032,1
19032,"This exact same box, without the light, would cost $1-2.",19032,1
19032,"However, I decided $10 was worth it for an illuminating ring box.",19032,1
19032,"So, in the end, the rings fails to achieve the purpose why I bought it!",19032,1
19032,*you can see in the photo that the LED pretty much points forward instead of down on the ring.,19032,1
19033,Not at all as pictured.,19033,1
19033,"Poor quality, very bad craftsmanship",19033,1
19034,what was this rag they sent?,19034,1
19034,looks nothing  like the picture,19034,1
19035,"No stars,  ordered a 0 to 3 months,  the ones I received are for a 3 year old, suggested for the 0-3 is 70cm, the one i received was 80 and could have easily fit a toddler.",19035,1
19035,"i have to return them, as it would sit in my closet for the next year or two until my kid is large enough to fit.",19035,1
19036,"Fits tight , do not recommend .",19036,1
19037,Looks nothing like the photo.,19037,1
19037,"The cut of the dress is terrible and even ordering larger than I am, it was barely considered a shirt.",19037,1
19038,I got this coat for my girlfriend she loved it till she try too put it on and it was too small.,19038,1
19038,I got a 4x so it would be big for her.,19038,1
19038,But it looked  like  a large.,19038,1
19038,So there coats run very small.,19038,1
19039,It is beautiful but my long strap was broken when I got it.,19039,1
19039,Thats ridiculous.,19039,1
19039,I paid $20 for a purse I'm not going to use because I can't use the long strap and I don't like the short straps either.,19039,1
19039,The purse is also very poor qualit.,19039,1
19039,DON'T BUY IT!,19039,1
19039,*****UPDATED***** I AM RETURNING THE PURSE.,19039,1
19039,I figure I'm not going to use it.,19039,1
19039,its broken so I am sending it back.,19039,1
19039,I will buy another purse from target.,19039,1
19039,still very disappointed in this product.,19039,1
19040,"On first arrival, the tie clip looked like a great purchase.",19040,1
19040,"However, when I used it it was not long enough for the tie to be centered on my shirt.",19040,1
19040,The tie was not a very wide tie but the back end would only just reach the center of the tie so it wouldn't catch my shirt.,19040,1
19040,It would work for one of those skinny ties but really who would wear those ties.,19040,1
19040,So if you aren't wearing a skinny tie then don't buy it.,19040,1
19041,I wear a med and bought and xl because I wanted it to wear with leggins.,19041,1
19041,It is way to small now they will only give me 20% back.,19041,1

19108,Cheapest material i've ever seen in a shirt.,19108,1
19108,"I am 6ft tall, the fit in the XL is short and wide with an oversized collar and very sheer, hold it up to the light and you can see straight through it.",19108,1
19108,The graphic is awesome but don't expect to be able to wear the shirt.,19108,1
19109,Way too big.,19109,1
19109,Had to spend more than what we paid for the dress to have it altered.,19109,1
19110,Zippers both broke within days of using & the bags were NOT overfilled.,19110,1
19111,"I purchased these as my daughter wanted sandals for school, but I do like opened toe shoes at school (on the playground or an unexpected sports class etc.)",19111,1
19111,"So I chose these as an inexpensive alternative, (as kids grow out of shoes yearly) also as an add on item to an additional order.",19111,1
19111,"This aside I still wanted them to do the job and be functional cute, summer to fall, then winter into spring school shoes, also possibly be passed down to her sister, so I did shop around and read reviews.",19111,1
19111,"Firstly many reviewers said they ran way small (like a whole size), so I ordered a size and a half up, (which was only a half size bigger than her new school tennis shoes) so she could get the school year out of them.",19111,1
19111,Well when they came in she they were way too big!,19111,1
19111,"so I don't know if they really run much smaller than expected, I would say they are fairly close to true to size,,,, these now will probably fit her two years!",19111,1
19111,"** Secondly the reason I gave these only one star, (and this is my bad) I read mostly great reviews 4-5 stars only concern was the size.",19111,1
19111,"BUT there was one reviewer that gave the only bad review, and that was about the quality, she said they did not even last one day on the playground when her daughter wore them to school, that the shoes came home terribly scuffed on the toes, like the toes actually worn off!",19111,1
19111,Well THIS also happened to us!,19111,1
19111,"I should have turned away after reading that one review but I didn't, so I guess it is my fault.",19111,1
19111,"My daughter also came home after wearing these shoes for the first time today, and the toes are mostly WHITE !",19111,1
19111,!,19111,1
19111,they are that scuffed.,19111,1
19111,"Not just scuffs, but the color completely gone!",19111,1
19111,worn off !,19111,1
19111,"And she swears she did not do anything out of the ordinary, just regular school yard play, and average classroom activities.",19111,1
19111,"Knowing my child I believe her, yes she is very active and does run around, swing, climb and crawl thru the tunnels on her school playground, but I've also watched her play and know she is not rough or excessive when she is playing.",19111,1
19111,"So my review --- STAY AWAY from these shoes, these are cheap as far as shoes go, so I guess I got what I paid for, but even at almost $17 I thought they world last maybe six months.",19111,1
19111,"NOPE, unless you are only looking for a pair to last one day, and during that time your child will not ever be going outdoors of running/crawling/jumping/skipping around any, save your money, spend a little extra on a quality brand, I DO NOT recommend these!",19111,1
19111,"These will not make it through the whole school year, I am embarrassed to let her wear them even one more day as they now look so terrible, and these most certainly will not last to be past down to her little sister :(

(on any kind of plus side, she still thinks they are pretty, and says we can try to color over them a bit.",19111,1
19111,"And even though they are a little bigger than we wanted, she says they are comfortable, if that is any consolation)",19111,1
19112,It is cheaply made the seams are coming apart.,19112,1
19113,"Didn't look much like the photo, looks incredibly cheap.",19113,1
19113,Sizing is way off.,19113,1
19114,"Not good quality, it does not smell like leather.",19114,1
19115,Its nothing like the picture where it has multiple diamonds .,19115,1
19115,I ordered the silver one its non adjustable so disappointed,19115,1
19116,Very disappointed.,19116,1
19116,Arrived tarnished.,19116,1
19116,Also turned my finger GREEN in One day.,19116,1
19117,Extra large MIGHT have fit my skinny 9 year old.,19117,1
19117,Doesn't really look like the picture either.,19117,1
19118,This was marked a 2XX when received it.,19118,1
19118,"But just looking at it, it was obviously small.",19118,1
19118,"Not as pictured, what a waste of money, it is a good thing it was not expensive.",19118,1
19118,I'll give it as a gift to someone very thin.,19118,1
19118,"Too much trouble to send back,  It looks more like a nightgown then a ""loose summer cover up"".",19118,1
19119,"I wanted to like this hat, but it just didn't work out.",19119,1
19119,"The brim is way too floppy that the slightest movement or wind would flip it up, defeating the purpose of blocking the sun.",19119,1
19119,"Be aware that if this hat gets wet, it becomes useless.",19119,1
19119,It just completely collapses when wet and the brim was on my sons face covering his eyes.,19119,1
19119,"It also gets pretty flimsy when my son would get sweaty or even just the humidity from outside would make it ""wet"" and flop down on his face.",19119,1
19119,I ended up later purchasing a Sunday Afternoons hat with a sturdy brim and that has been perfect.,19119,1
19120,I have a very small head and this was a little snug.,19120,1
19120,This product is for a small child with very little or flat hair.,19120,1
19121,Unrealistically small.,19121,1
19122,Had to return,19122,1
19123,This dress is nothing like u see here.,19123,1
19123,Its underlining is a blush colored fabric n the sequence is very ugly..,19123,1
19124,If you have a tiny or extremely narrow torso this may work for you but I'm a 34C and it didn't cover my breasts at all!,19124,1
19125,So tiny not worth the price.,19125,1
19126,Came with a hole when I took it out of the bag.,19126,1
19126,"Very thin, and smaller than I anticipated.",19126,1
19127,"never wore it because it came like extra, extra, extra small.",19127,1
19127,:(,19127,1
19128,"I bought ""an American large"" and is basically an extra small.",19128,1
19128,It will probably fit a 10 year old girl.,19128,1
19129,This dress was nothing what it looked like.,19129,1
19129,I returned it and never got a refund.,19129,1
19129,Please do yourself a favor and avoid buying this dress.,19129,1
19130,Cheap!!,19130,1
19130,You get what you pay for - use the dollars towards something else that is better quality and will last longer!,19130,1

19132,Scratchy and small.,19132,1
19132,Weird fit.,19132,1
19133,Too tight and too short.,19133,1

19134,Gave it away instead.,19134,1
19135,After using this shoes seven times for regular activities like walking or dancing the sole came out.,19135,1
19135,I am very disappointed.,19135,1
19135,I don't recommend this product at all.,19135,1
19135,The worse part is that I can not return this item because the return window closed 4 days ago.,19135,1
19136,These were shoe laces,19136,1
19137,This bathing suit was so cheap that after wearing it once and washing it the top completely ripped apart.,19137,1
19137,I would never buy it again.,19137,1
19137,So disappointed!,19137,1
19138,This dress did not come with any jeweled necklace as I read the reveiws it seem like it was suppose to.,19138,1

19139,Really poor quality plastic copy!,19139,1
19140,I returned it.,19140,1
19140,"I put the strap through both the top and side handles of my large suitcase, tightened snuggly, and in under two minutes I was able to l was able to loosen the straps enough to unzip the suitcase and access the entire contents.",19140,1

19144,No use,19144,1
19145,I know it says super over sized but this was definitely awkwardly big on anyone,19145,1
19146,"I bought three different colors, but when I received them the product looks cheap and thin.",19146,1
19147,"Very cute and arrived way before estimated delivery date, but within the first hour I had it on the chain broke and the cute little heart charm was gone, I always wear anklets in the summer with my sandals and have never had one break this quickly.",19147,1

19151,The 'gold' is just a golden paint put on a regular lodestone that actually negates the attractive quality that one would purchase a lodestone for.,19151,1
19151,Wouldn't recommend.,19151,1
19151,I received only one fairly-sized lodestone and two tiny little nothings.,19151,1
19151,Only the larger one would attract the iron filings because the gold paint was worn off of it.,19151,1
19151,Buy a regular one.,19151,1

19198,I didn't get holes in the other stocking until about day 5 of wearing them.,19198,1

19277,"The liner was unfinished, uneven, unraveled, and jagged.",19277,1
19277,"It would be better if the liner wasn't even included, I could wear it as a swim suit cover up.",19277,1
19277,There's no way to cut it out to make it better.,19277,1
19278,"First of all, I assumed that because they are called 'leggings' that they are leggings.",19278,1
19278,They are not.,19278,1

19282,It's a European XL which is evidently smaller than a US XL.,19282,1
19282,It's also cheaply made.,19282,1
19282,the zipper moves with difficulty and zips on the right as women's clothes do.,19282,1
19282,It came from Great Britain with no instructions on how to return it; so I'm stuck with it.,19282,1

19540,"This is not made for big noggins, and the material feels too stiff.",19540,1
19540,The closest thing I can compare the material to is my velour dashmat which has a foam backing.,19540,1
19540,"I can't really tell if this is made from polar fleece or not, but it feels a bit stiffer than I would have expected (if I connect the ends and stand it on edge, it does not lose it's form and slump over).",19540,1
19540,Either way it is too small for my average size head (I can use it but the velcro holds on by a small margin and it is a bit too tight).,19540,1

19549,These socks are much thinner than other brands I've bought.,19549,1
19549,The only reason I bought them was because the item description says they are 80% merino wool but the back of the pack clearly says 71%.,19549,1

19634,"I washed it, thinking that would help.",19634,1
19634,It didn't.,19634,1
19634,So this now will be a (very hot ) costume for him.,19634,1
19634,I bought a set of towels that was the same type of fabric and they were awful - not absorbant and a little slimy-feeling.,19634,1
19634,I should have known right away when he refused to wear it that there was something wrong.,19634,1
19635,The size was perfect but the head hole that your head would slip through was so small it would be impossible for an infant to put their head through it.,19635,1

19640,Horribly cheap hurt my ears the tapers are great but the tunnels were terrible,19640,1
19641,I never write negative reviews - because putting out negative energy into the world just plain sucks!,19641,1
19641,"But this product looked so completely contrary to what was advertised, both in the photo and in the description, that I felt like it was my duty to warn others.",19641,1
19641,I should have listened to the previous reviewer - when they mentioned that it looks more like a shower curtain...except that I think they were being a bit too generous.,19641,1
19641,"I'd say you can likely find this item in the cheap shower liner aisle, maybe in the discounted bin or something.",19641,1
19641,"Having said that, a shower curtain liner might actually have a more acceptable texture.",19641,1
19641,The label says it's 100% cotton.,19641,1

19641,"And yes, it is that funny.",19641,1
19641,"I gave this product one star because it is white, and it sort of vaguely resembles a dress in an abstract way.",19641,1
19642,This dress runs very small.,19642,1

19752,But I think it was made for a Barbie Doll.,19752,1
19752,Ugh!,19752,1

19755,Have ordered the multiple colored pack & the black RBX that had the quality I enjoy.,19755,1
19756,run small poor quality,19756,1
19757,I just received mine and I ordered a large I'm usually a medium and the bottoms are so small it does not cover anything on me!,19757,1

19760,This Large shirt was enormous!,19760,1
19760,More like a 12/14.,19760,1
19760,I bought two other polo shirts by Hilfiger in Medium and it was not an issue.,19760,1
19760,They fit a little loose but it is not a form fitting style.,19760,1

19760,The sizing on this particular shirt is WAY large compared to others.,19760,1
19760,There is no way it is for someone who usually wears a 6.,19760,1

19763,Just go naked because that's what will happen.,19763,1
19763,Material is thin and craftsmanship is awful.,19763,1
19763,"I know its cheap so you're like ""ok ill try this"" but it was a waste of money.",19763,1

19926,"If your looking for a nightgown, you found it....if you looking for a Maxi dress, this IS NOT  the one you want to buy!",19926,1
19926,"Very thin material, like a nightgown or slip and it comes with NO HEM on the bottom, just material.",19926,1
19926,I contacted the company and was told I would have to pay to send it back to China if I wanted a refund.....that costs more then what I paid for the dress!,19926,1
19926,"Lesson learned, you get what you pay for!",19926,1
19926,Don't make the same mistake.,19926,1

19929,Couldn't even sit down.,19929,1
19929,I even went over the reviews before ordering and was ify about this.,19929,1
19929,Choose carefully the size for the length.,19929,1
19930,"I ordered a large and it looked like an xsmall, the material was terrible like paper the button hole was like they just cut a slit in the material.",19930,1

19931,"Used the foam brush, and before I could get to my second shoe, the foam had torn and separated from the wood handle.",19931,1
19931,"I then used the horsehair brush (which is not horsehair, but instead is a synthetic bristle) to remove the polish, and due to a cheap polish, left residue all over my shoes.",19931,1
19931,"I threw the kit away, aside from the two small bristle brushes which may come in handy to clean a shoe or other household item, and will reorder another higher quality product.",19931,1

19933,"The display is blindingly bright; so even though you can see yourself in dimly lit rooms, your face isn't going to be cute squinting at the light.",19933,1
19933,The case is also extremely bulky and cheaply made.,19933,1
19933,The Plus is already a massive phone and the case just makes it too large to get a good grip around the phone.,19933,1
19933,"The case also doesn't fit the phone very nicely, there are giant gaps for the volume buttons and charging hole.",19933,1
19933,"I recommend just bitting the bullet and buying a real lumee, the cheap knock off isn't worth it.",19933,1

19952,I'm 5'3 145 lbs and I wear a size 8. it wasn't going to go on past my thighs.,19952,1

19952,So WAYYYY to small.,19952,1
19953,To long for my  taste and the pockets are way to small to hold anything I carry.,19953,1
19953,Really thin.,19953,1
19953,Was going to return but was going to have to ship to China to get a refund.,19953,1

19960,It was too large and wondering if can be refunded.,19960,1
19961,I am giving this a 1 star because the sizing is wrong for plus sizes!,19961,1
19961,The 1X is NOT a (20-22) it is more like 14/16!,19961,1
19961,I will say the material is nice but if it is the least bit snug it will show any lumps or giggly bits!!,19961,1
19961,I am going to try larger size just dislike inconvenience of having to return and re-order.,19961,1

19962,Needs a better fit or separate case.,19962,1
19963,"These are not yoga pants, nor pants made for any type of exercise - they are tights.",19963,1
19963,"They are opaque enough that you could get away with wearing them as pants, if it weren't for the horribly obvious contrast color in the crotch area.",19963,1
19963,"Also, the material is some sort of nylon blend - definitely NOT meant for sweating in!",19963,1
19963,"If they had been sold as tights, I would be ok with them.",19963,1

19965,However the shirt is SO small.,19965,1
19965,The arms are extremely narrow and will even be tight on my 12month old.,19965,1
19965,It is not a long shirt either.,19965,1
19965,A 4T should have come past her waist but it barely will cover her tummy.,19965,1

19974,Cheap knockoff version.,19974,1
19974,You get what you pay for .,19974,1
19974,Shoulda spent the extra 10 bucks and got it from urban outfitters,19974,1
19975,This is not well made.,19975,1
19975,I sliced my finger open closing it cause a piece wasn't put on right.,19975,1
19976,It would have been helpful to see this sweater on an adult model.,19976,1
19976,"I am 5'2"" and wear a size small.",19976,1
19976,As I wanted the sweater to fit loosely I ordered a medium.,19976,1
19976,The sleeves were way too small and short.,19976,1
19976,The sweater did not have a puffed appearance at all and was uncomfortably tight.,19976,1
19976,The sweater was also rather short and ultimately looked frumpy.,19976,1
19976,It had a slightly oily smell but I think it would have been alright after washing.,19976,1
19976,"Add that the material was a bit scratchy and the finishing at the neck did not look like it would last, I returned this item.",19976,1
19976,"It might have been cute on a child, a non-picky child that did not mind scratchy materials.",19976,1
19977,Not at all as pictured!,19977,1
19977,"Material is chalky and rough, color is dull and ugly.",19977,1
19977,Very disappointing,19977,1
19978,This was one of the most uncomfortable bra's I have ever worn.,19978,1

19978,I ordered the size I usually wear and had to put it on the smallest fitting and it still was a little big on me around my chest.,19978,1
19978,The cups fit as expected.,19978,1
19978,"The stitching on front is bumpy and I can't wear any silky or smooth type fabric, it's still a little unflattering wearing a cotton shirt but not as bad.",19978,1
19978,I returned this.,19978,1
19979,This shirt is not true to size.,19979,1
19979,XL is more like a Medium.,19979,1
19980,"Cheap quality, looks like a night gown",19980,1
19981,It was way too small & the material is really thin.,19981,1
19982,"After the two washes, two pairs already had toe holes; thin fabric.",19982,1
19982,"Good style, they just won't last you though.",19982,1
19983,"The shirt was a plain white Tshirt,  no sleeves.",19983,1
19983,"I was horrified as it was a gift for my niece who lived overseas, needles to say it was a waste of money with a very poorly made.",19983,1
19983,Very disappointed.,19983,1
19984,I received this tunic today but it was way too big.,19984,1
19984,"It's my fault for not checking the size chart before ordering, but I won't be returning it because they charge a $7.50 return fee and I would have to pay shipping on top of that, which would end up costing more than what I paid for the tunic.",19984,1
19984,"Aside from the sizing, I didn't like that the fabric was way thick and somewhat coarse(?",19984,1
19984,"), and the black was a very faded black as if it's been worn and washed many times.",19984,1
19985,Highly disappointed!!,19985,1
19985,I ordered 2 dresses for my twins birthday.,19985,1
19985,The flowers are the dresses are glued.,19985,1

19987,Not good.,19987,1
19987,I won't do that again.,19987,1
19988,"It looks like the picture, but it's a gross material that's shiny and very thin.",19988,1
19988,It's also much too small.,19988,1
19988,"I didn't send it back because it wasn't worth it, but I would NOT recommend this product.",19988,1
19989,Not comfortable .,19989,1
19990,They are too big !,19990,1
19991,Pretty pissed off.,19991,1
19991,Cute that the description changed AFTER I wasted my money.,19991,1
19991,I bought this because it originally said 16 AND 14 GAUGE... That was a lie.,19991,1
19991,I bought this because it was cheap even if I had to toss out half of them for being 16 and I only cared about the 14s... Super glad I have a million useless pieces of body jewelry now.,19991,1
19992,These were bought for my wife who has very sensitive skin.,19992,1
19992,One day after putting them in they started to embed and her lobes are infected.,19992,1
19992,Surgical steel ?,19992,1

20004,Magnetic piece broke within a week of light and careful use and I kept trying to repair it since I loved the bag so much unfortunately after I spent money at the hardware store trying to repair it with different glues no luck (the fabric was ripping) I gave up.,20004,1
20004,Then two days later after that the zipper completely ripped off the middle pocket..upset I had this experience because intitally this was such a great bag,20004,1

20025,"The material was thin, size was off and the stitching had flaw in it.",20025,1

20140,They come maybe 5 inches from ankle,20140,1

20145,Thats all i can say for this product.,20145,1
20146,The fact that the skirt was too small isn't that big of a deal.,20146,1

20173,Even the saying is wrong.,20173,1
20174,Size  actually  a size smaller  didn't  wash yet may only get a few wears  so if u need a large  get an XL,20174,1

20178,Very cheap!,20178,1
20179,Way too short to be a dress... more like a long peplum top.,20179,1
20179,"This is not a little peek when I bent over, more like you would be able to see all the way to the tops of my bikini panties if I raised my arms, which is absolutely ridiculous for anything labeled as a dress.",20179,1
20179,"I have to buy petite pants to avoid hemming, so I'm not that tall.",20179,1
20179,"Also ""space cotton"" is really thick polyester, which is highly misleading.",20179,1

20186,I gave it away.,20186,1
20187,"The color and fit of top was nice, however, after two wears the seam of the shirt by collar was completely unraveling.",20187,1
20187,Due to material it's irreparable and can no longer wear.,20187,1

20200,A bit oversized .,20200,1
20200,What I got was a very cheap light weight sweater that is form fitting and the side pockets make my hips look pointed and dis formed.,20200,1

20282,"Size was off, material was poor.",20282,1
20282,Would not recommend.,20282,1
20283,It's a really sexy looking suit!,20283,1
20283,"It really is.. And I was so excited to get it for my girls trip to Vegas, however; It just doesn't work for my body type.",20283,1
20283,"I ordered three different colors (white, black, red), all size M, because I couldn't decide which I really wanted.",20283,1
20283,"All three were made differently, which doesn't reflect it in the images.",20283,1
20283,"First off, the white - the bottoms were seriously just granny panties.",20283,1
20283,"The garters in the waistband and the legholes were too tight, but the material ballooned on me.",20283,1
20283,And it fell about an inch below my belly button.,20283,1
20283,The white top was the only one of the three that was double layered.,20283,1
20283,"Now, for the black suit - I think out of the three this was the one I liked best.",20283,1
20283,The bottom had an almost seamless look once you had it on.,20283,1
20283,This had the best fit without being too loose and it covered up to my belly button.,20283,1
20283,"Unfortunately, the top was just a long price of cloth that was cut out.",20283,1
20283,They didn't even bother sewing in seams on it.,20283,1
20283,The length though was long enough that you could have played around with it in order to find different ways to tie it.,20283,1
20283,Annnd the red - the material for this had a shine to it and it was very stretchy.,20283,1
20283,The bottom reach all the way under my breast.,20283,1
20283,After putting that on I didn't even bother messing with the top.,20283,1
20283,The top's seams were sewn too tight that it looked like it was ruffled.,20283,1
20283,It was also shorter in length than the other two tops.,20283,1
20283,"As much as I loved the look of it in the images, it just didn't work out for me.",20283,1
20283,I'll be returning them shortly.,20283,1
20284,It's too small and not tall enough it was a bad buy I'm going to return it,20284,1
20285,This shirt is not true to size.,20285,1
20285,It is way smaller then an American size 2xl.,20285,1
20285,It is much thinner material then it appears to be.,20285,1
20285,Not worth it at all.,20285,1
20286,"Cheap material, reminds me of a Halloween costume.",20286,1
20286,"Also, there is a huge slit up the back that is not shown in the picture which makes this dress unwearable in public even if it was made out of normal apparel fabric...",20286,1
20287,"Doesn't look anything like the picture
And the material is itchy
I would never recommend this item to anyone",20287,1
20288,I normally wear an X-Large in women's.,20288,1
20288,I ordered an X-Large in this size and it fits more like a medium.,20288,1
20288,"Can't wear it, it is so tight and uncomfortable.",20288,1
20288,I didn't sent it back because maybe in another year my 11 year old will be able to wear it.,20288,1
20289,JACKET WAS TOO SMAIL AND IT WAS NOT A MEN'S JACKET THE ZIPPER IS ON THE WRONG SIDE,20289,1
20290,Glasses claim that they are very dark and almost impossible to see unless it's super bright bright and sunny.,20290,1
20290,Actually they're not that dark in my opinion and can be worn probably on a cloudy day.,20290,1
20290,Even cloudy days you supposed to wear sunglasses.,20290,1
20290,Hope their product description is true because he claims to be a very high quality product meeting industry standards for UV protection.,20290,1
20290,When I open the glasses they could hardly move the arms very cheaply made but they fit my face well and I plan on wearing them anyway.,20290,1
20290,For that price I guess I shouldn't have expected the quality to be higher,20290,1
20291,Shirt is way too big for size purchased.,20291,1
20292,"Way to small, very disappointed had to give both pair away",20292,1
20293,Wayyyyy too small,20293,1
20294,Sure isn't what I expected.,20294,1
20295,The ring tarnished only after a few days!,20295,1
20295,Not happy at all,20295,1
20296,I ordered a Small and the bottoms were way too tight and the top was awkwardly cut and did not fight right.,20296,1
20296,"The material is not what I expected, not in a good way.",20296,1
20296,The shipping took a very long time as well.,20296,1
20296,"Overall, I am not happy with the purchase.",20296,1
20297,They broke immediately.,20297,1
20297,Very disappointed.,20297,1
20297,Had purchased for snow bird trip to Florida.,20297,1
20298,I chose a size bigger and it was still too small,20298,1
20299,Very disappointed with this purchase.,20299,1
20299,I have only used the bag one time and it is already ripping.,20299,1
20299,Very poor quality.,20299,1
20299,It's a shame because it's a good looking bag.,20299,1

20350,The band is also very nice and well made.,20350,1

20350,But I am very happy with this ring!,20350,1
20350,Update....,20350,1
20350,Within a few days of wearing the ring I noticed that it had a loose stone.,20350,1
20350,I didn't want to send it back to have it replaced because it already had sentimental value so I paid out of pocket to have it fixed.,20350,1
20350,A few weeks later another stone was loose.,20350,1
20350,I contacted the company about it and they were little to no help.,20350,1
20350,So I ended up paying out of my pocket AGAIN to have it fixed and make sure that the last stone was in there tight.,20350,1
20350,Very disappointed with the quality and customer service about this issue.,20350,1
20350,Don't buy from them!,20350,1

20388,It could have been made in a middle school sewing class.,20388,1
20388,It does not look anything like the picture and is much longer than on the model.,20388,1
20388,"The sides come down almost past my knees, but the V comes about to the nether regions so it cannot be worn as a dress, and looks kinda silly with pants/leggings.",20388,1

20399,"I am a medium usually, size 7, and probably a little too skinny.",20399,1
20399,The medium wouldn't fit around my waist.,20399,1
20399,So I ordered a large that came before I had a chance to send back the medium.,20399,1

20404,I can't believe this had such a high rating.,20404,1
20404,This really makes me feel like I can't trust the judgement of people who review this stuff.,20404,1
20404,Can standards and expectations really be so low?,20404,1
20404,The fit was terrible in that it didn't drape well and came up way to high on the neck.,20404,1
20404,The traps were way too short.,20404,1
20404,The fabric was cheap and does not breath at all.,20404,1
20404,"I ended up replacing the straps because they are not adjustable and were so short that the shirt would not ""fall off"" the shoulders to give the effect like is in fashion now and is shown in the photos.",20404,1
20404,It was also so terrible that I ended up cutting out some of the lace on the shoulders so it could fall in a flattering way.,20404,1
20404,I also slit the sides to give it a little movement.,20404,1
20404,I was tempted to just tear out the tacky lining as well but the top fabric is so thin I decided to leave it in.,20404,1
20404,I should have just returned it and probably will never wear it.,20404,1
20404,I will say that it fit across the bust and was a nice length but the lace is so cheap and was already falling apart when i got it.,20404,1

20429,"I didn't even bother opening it, so I can't vouch for the durability.",20429,1
20429,"Although, I tend to think that if it was THAT damaged from shipping (box was fine, but there was a box of legos in the box with the umbrella) then it's not a very durable item.",20429,1
20430,"Stained, poor stitching.",20430,1

20441,No...I will not be taking the time and energy to return this thing.,20441,1
20441,The only reason I order this is because I was looking for another belt of this type and was forced to order something to get the other items ordered.,20441,1
20442,They are cheap in price and you can tell...they are not as delicate as these photos make them appear.,20442,1

20472,"I emailed SKECHERs and they advised me to work with Amazon to replace them, or I could pay to sent them in and have them mail me a new pair at the same price.",20472,1

20520,"Iam sorry
But it's bad quality",20520,1
20521,"Fit is very small, I had to return and i am a size medium",20521,1
20522,I have only had it a week - wore it twice and the string holding charms all untied.,20522,1
20522,Poor Quality,20522,1
20523,These are not shirt collar brass but the giant jacket collar pins.,20523,1

20527,No good.,20527,1
20527,Horribles,20527,1
20528,I only received one pair.,20528,1
20528,At the time it showed part of the oerder pending.,20528,1
20528,"Now, when I remembered to check several months later, the order shows as filled.",20528,1
20528,"At this point it's not worth trying to get the two remaining pair sent to me, so I write this review as a warning to other buyers.",20528,1
20529,Not an accurate description.,20529,1
20529,"This is a child's size large not a ""women's"" size at all.",20529,1
20529,"Length is more like a crop top, not at all like the picture.",20529,1
20529,It also unravels very easily.,20529,1
20530,"These pants are see through especially when vending over, so be careful wearing them outside in the sun or in any bright light...also, the small I orded were like 6 inches too long, I am 5'3",20530,1
20531,This dress should have been beautiful.,20531,1
20531,It had everything I was looking for.,20531,1
20531,But it had a MAJOR flaw- this thing is TRANSPARENT on top with two white circles for your boobs!,20531,1
20531,The close up of the bodice DOES NOT show that!!!,20531,1
20531,If it had been lined.... but it is not.,20531,1
20531,"As is, I looked like a Viking lead singer in an opera!",20531,1
20532,Unreliable,20532,1
20533,It has a horrible cut.,20533,1
20533,It is no flattering at all,20533,1
20534,Too small and graphic looked like a high schooler could have done it.,20534,1
20535,For the material it's made out of it should go up too bigger sizes,20535,1
20536,Too small.,20536,1
20536,I went up 3 sizes,20536,1
20537,This will be an ashame to ware it.,20537,1

20540,it looks to cheap.,20540,1
20541,"Okay, don't get me wrong, I know I have slightly longer than average fingers, however these gloves are ridiculous.",20541,1
20541,"They absolutely do not even come close to fitting properly and on top of that, they are quite poorly made.",20541,1
20541,The seams across the fronts of the fingers are very prominent and unattractive in person.,20541,1
20541,The ruffle at the base of the glove is much longer and less ruffly not to mention completely frayed and falling apart.,20541,1
20541,These gloves are an absolute waste of money.,20541,1
20541,EDIT: When this company saw my review they emailed me asking me to take the review down which I feel borders on unethical.,20541,1
20541,I wouldn't trust the other positive reviews after the communications that I have has with this company.,20541,1
20542,"This was an impulse buy, and now I truly regret it!",20542,1
20542,The color is a vivid royal blue.,20542,1
20542,But the shirt only looks good on the model!,20542,1
20542,"The style is weird: it has a seam in front that goes to the side which makes the shirt ""move weird"" and makes it looks like it has a very shallow pocket!",20542,1
20542,The sleeves were short to be a buttoned-style and the elastic on the bottom makes it looks like you'll fly away!,20542,1

20626,"The second one, which I kept(bc I needed it)...I had to carefully take off all the ""appliance"" pieces, bc they were so sideways and crooked, and glue them on myself- including the leg guards that were so low(costume is REALLY long) that the pant legs were bunched up making it look ridiculous.",20626,1
20626,"So after many try ons, marking and confirming and then glueing each and every piece onto this costume correctly,  I fee I deserve the other 4 stars.",20626,1
20626,"Oh, did I mention I, luckily have lots of paint markers?",20626,1
20626,Which is a really good thing since the appliance pieces(except the leg guards- bc they are plain black) all needed touch-ups or just straight up repainting.,20626,1

20636,Other than that it's really cute.,20636,1
20636,I also don't like that you can't tie the top yourself.,20636,1
20636,That would make things a lot easier.,20636,1
20637,Lasted about a week then all the Polish was gone.,20637,1
20638,Definately not sized correctly,20638,1
20639,Damaged beyond repair.,20639,1
20639,Chain broken into 3 pieces.,20639,1
20639,Would be a cute inexpensive accessory if not in pieces.,20639,1
20640,WAY TO SMALL.,20640,1
20640,I ordered a large and it didn't even start to fit,20640,1
20641,"I am a average size person 5' 10"" and 150 lbs.",20641,1
20641,The cut and shape of this dress MAKE my breast look like they were at the bottom of my rib cage!,20641,1
20641,"I was super disappointed too, I bought several different colors and none fit.",20641,1
20641,"I was looking for a dressy, second look for a big night out with my husband!",20641,1
20641,He was even more disappointed because he helped pick them out when I purchased them.,20641,1
20642,They are to small I was disappointed at the price!,20642,1
20643,"This should not have any kind of ""X"" in the size.",20643,1
20643,The 3X is more like a size misses 6-8.,20643,1
20643,I gave it to a tiny friend because the cost of return shipping would have made it a loss for the price I paid.,20643,1
20644,Wore them once and the leg has done ripped open.,20644,1
20644,Not worth the money.,20644,1
20645,Not very good quality and the shape of fit is poorly made!,20645,1
20646,so I ordered the red plaid one?,20646,1
20646,and it's not black and red it's black and purple!,20646,1
20647,it looked completely different when i opened it in the mail,20647,1
20648,I'm about 100lbs and wear between a 0-2 depending on the clothes item and this did not fit.,20648,1
20648,I am a 32B and wear size 26 bottoms and it was not made for people who are not full chested or have a tiny behind.,20648,1
20648,I ordered the small and it did not fit,20648,1
20649,Where ripped when I received them,20649,1
20650,Wish the dimensions were more exact.,20650,1
20650,"I love oversized, but this is WAYYY too big....",20650,1
20651,Dont waste your money,20651,1
20652,Really comfortable but doesn't flatten at all and now I've paid $60 for a sports bra,20652,1
20653,Wasn't what I expected.,20653,1
20653,Thought this was a faux suede dress.,20653,1
20653,It is just a long turtleneck shirt,20653,1
20654,Get what you pay  for .,20654,1
20654,Too heavy and cheap looking,20654,1
20655,Color is not as shown in the picture.,20655,1
20655,Disappointed,20655,1
20656,Did not look nothing like in the picture.,20656,1
20656,Very cheap quality the textured and look.,20656,1
20656,XL is really large.,20656,1
20657,"Made in China, not American size standards.",20657,1
20657,Very small,20657,1
20658,I ordered 1 size bigger than I wear and it is still to small.,20658,1
20659,The earrings hand off the ear and slide down.. even when the backs are on tight,20659,1
20660,Broken post and cheap material.,20660,1
20660,Does not look like advertised photos.,20660,1
20661,I purchased this shirt with some extreme caution because there are so many Asian sized clothing items available on Amazon (an entirely other problem altogether in my opinion).,20661,1
20661,"But I am 5'10"" tall where a 36C.",20661,1
20661,I went by the size chart listed with this item and still when the shirt arrived it was almost FUNNY how small it was.,20661,1
20661,I mean - I didn't even try it on - there was absolutely NO POINT.,20661,1
20661,Holding it up to my torso - it didn't even make it to my hips.,20661,1
20661,It was laughable.,20661,1
20661,Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this shirt unless you are a teeny tiny person or someone who has time to waste.,20661,1
20662,Quality is low.,20662,1
20662,Cheap toy but my son loves to play with it.,20662,1
20662,I pay more for a better quality toy.,20662,1
20663,About the size of a Keychain and it was broke even though it was safely wrapped.,20663,1
20663,Obviously broke before sending.,20663,1
20664,The one positive is that it cait a week early.,20664,1
20664,Other than that well the cross is really small & the infinity symbol is a little big.,20664,1
20664,So it look like they should be parts to two different necklaces.,20664,1
20664,Plus the metal isn't silver it is some really cheap alloy.,20664,1
20664,To be honest it reminded me of a necklace from the coin machine outside the grocery store from when I was a kid...,20664,1
20665,Cute but way too small,20665,1
20666,The item I received is definitely different from the image.,20666,1
20666,"Very sheer, cheaply made material.",20666,1
20666,The crochet part is tattered and looks ready to rip at any moment.,20666,1
20666,Very dissatisfied.,20666,1
20666,"Also, the sizing chart only goes up to xl but they sell up to 5x.",20666,1
20666,I ordered a 5x and it was the equivalent of a xl or 1x.,20666,1
20666,Very unhappy.,20666,1
20666,The price reflects the lack of quality and I will not be buying from them again!,20666,1
20667,Size chart is WRONG!,20667,1
20667,And it's way too small in chest dimension.,20667,1
20667,Must return it for exchange.,20667,1
20668,Absolutely Beautiful.,20668,1
20668,Loved it from the moment I opened the box.,20668,1
20668,Worked great with my baby fine hair.,20668,1
20668,1st one to do so.,20668,1
20668,BUT when I went to order one for my daughter they wanted to charge me 25.00 because I live in Alaska.,20668,1
20668,That's just outrageous to me.,20668,1
20668,I know it doesn't cost them that much to ship it here.,20668,1
20668,Too bad it cost them a customer and I'll be sure to tell my friends too.,20668,1
20668,That's why they get a 1 star instead of a 5.,20668,1
20669,Want to return it.,20669,1
20670,No instructions just material delivered its crap!!!!!,20670,1
20670,!,20670,1
20671,"you get what you pay for, it looks nothing like the picture.",20671,1
20671,Some of the yellow circles were missing and it wasn't white -__-,20671,1
20672,The stick broke off after wearing them for an hour they suck,20672,1
20673,Nope too small,20673,1
20674,"While the color matches the photo, that's the only thing.",20674,1
20674,"The sleeves barely reach my forearms, and the fit is more like a midriff shirt, barely coming to my waist, much less reaching my hips in the front.",20674,1
20674,I cannot recommend this.,20674,1
20675,Mine broke after two days.,20675,1
20676,More like an extra small than a large.,20676,1
20676,Don't buy.,20676,1
20677,"This dress was packed in a ziplock bag, I knew instantly that I was going to return it.",20677,1
20677,"I took it out of the bag, it did not have any tags on it whatsoever.",20677,1
20677,Not even a tag on the inside of the dress.,20677,1
20677,"The dress looks like my Aunt Edith made it, poor quality, the material was very thin.",20677,1
20677,Not a good buy.,20677,1
20678,It didn't  fit it was to small I wear a large but i thought a xxl was big enough but it didn't  fit,20678,1
20679,There is no paperwork with these earrings,20679,1
20680,This necklace is horrible.,20680,1
20680,I've had it for only 24 hours and it already broke.,20680,1
20680,The top part of the hammer has fallen off the bottom.,20680,1
20680,So now I have a stick on a chain.,20680,1
20681,Way too small.,20681,1
20681,Can't wear it.,20681,1
20682,Broke after a day.,20682,1
20682,Makes an annoying amount of noise while walking.,20682,1
20682,Don't buy this.,20682,1
20683,"It was a size too small yet nothing was said about getting a size
Bigger than normal",20683,1
20684,I would give this zero stars if I could.,20684,1
20684,This just came in the mail and very disappointed with oh cheap this looks.,20684,1
20684,I guess you get what you pay for.,20684,1
20684,My advice is to not waste or money.,20684,1
20685,Looks and feels cheap returning it.,20685,1
20686,The center stone fell out the first time i wore it,20686,1
20687,Not plus size at all!,20687,1
20687,They fit small on my 110 pound husband!,20687,1
20688,Not good and even one cubic was missing from one of necklaces..,20688,1
20688,Returned it.,20688,1
20689,"The vest was way too small, now I don;t know what to do with it.",20689,1
20689,There was no paperwork to send it back to.,20689,1
20690,Very poor quality don't spend your money on that very disappointing,20690,1
20691,The stones look nothing like the picture except for the turquoise,20691,1
20692,I would not order this product again it is two hard to size the coat if you are wrong you are stuck.,20692,1
20692,Cheaply made,20692,1
20693,"these were made incorrectly, but the return was made easy.",20693,1
20693,They were too small.,20693,1
20693,"They were published as a 9-10 toddler but that was not the case.these were returned for credit, but I would give them another try.",20693,1
20694,Not at all what I expected.,20694,1
20694,I returned this bag because of the cheap looking quality.,20694,1
20694,"There was an odor to the lining, and the zippers were very difficult to zip.",20694,1
20695,Absolutely horrible experience trying to figure out how to wear this top.,20695,1
20695,Literally just 2 loops of fabric that somehow make a top.,20695,1
20695,Got it for a dance recital and wish I had returned it.,20695,1
20696,Bought this specifically for a UCLA game at the Rose Bowl to carry in our jackets for an evening game.,20696,1
20696,The transparent bag was rejected by security.,20696,1
20696,They said it was too big.,20696,1
20696,Seriously?!,20696,1
20696,Why would I by a smaller bag that would hold hardly anything.,20696,1
20696,This is a fairly good size bag that can hold 4 nicely packed sweat shirts.,20696,1
20696,I'm keeping it as there's nothing wrong with the bag.,20696,1
20696,It's misleading to believe that it's stadium approved.,20696,1
20696,My husband was about ready to throw the bag away rather then hike back to the car to drop it off.,20696,1
20696,Security was ok with us emptying the bag and my husband folding the bag and pocketing it... Where's the logic in that!,20696,1
20696,"Anyways, it was an awful start of our game day...",20696,1
20696,Thank goodness UCLA won!,20696,1
20697,It fits terrible.,20697,1
20697,Waste of money.,20697,1

20703,I have to return this and all 3 combo sets I bought from this seller.,20703,1
20703,The scarf is intentionally twisted but too tight for comfort.,20703,1
20703,They didn't use enough fabric to fit a small framed female.,20703,1
20704,Was not waterproof at all.,20704,1
20704,Don't know why someone would want to wear this just for the look.,20704,1
20704,You would wear it for its purpose (keeping hair dry) and the look is a bonus.,20704,1
20704,Would not purchase again and would not recommend.,20704,1
20705,Hate it!!!,20705,1

20712,come to find out from the post office that it would be more than $20 to ship back.,20712,1

20712,the smell is so bad that I would not ever wear the belt.,20712,1

20715,Returned,20715,1
20716,Horrible quality and the picture on the towels look super blurry.,20716,1
20716,Cheap towel and is thinner than paper not enough fabric to absorb anything let alone water off a swimmer,20716,1
20717,This product I brought for my friend & it must have started leaking because her phone had turned colors and the red stuff on the inside of the phone case was a bit low.,20717,1
20717,I wouldn't recommend this product.,20717,1
20718,Totally see through.,20718,1

20800,"Wrong material for this dress, makes it look and feel cheap or costume like.",20800,1
20801,if your neck is as small as a 5 years old child then this will work for you otherwise its a waste of money it doesn't even fit around your neck.,20801,1

20808,The hat arrived with 5-10 holes from from broken strands used to weave the hat.,20808,1
20808,After 4 days using the hat on a camping trip the top of the crown is ripped open.,20808,1
20808,This is just from casual use.,20808,1
20808,It received no abuse.,20808,1
20808,"The ""straw"" that is used is apparently very brittle and breaks very easily.",20808,1
20808,The straw hat I had before this one lasted several summers with many trips camping and to the beach.,20808,1
20808,I know what to expect from a straw hat.,20808,1
20808,It is too bad because this is a nice design but I cannot recommend this hat to anyone.,20808,1
20809,I am 5'9 about 130lbs.,20809,1
20809,I ordered a small.,20809,1
20809,It was about 5 times bigger than me.,20809,1
20809,It was a thin polyester/halloween costume material.,20809,1
20809,Nothing compared to the photo.,20809,1

20819,Not good at all,20819,1
20820,This shirt ripped the first day I wore it.,20820,1
20820,Very Poor quality.,20820,1
20821,Waaaaay too large.,20821,1
20821,The length is fine but it's extremely baggy.,20821,1
20821,I chose to buy it because they said the model is 5'3.,20821,1
20821,I'm 5'2 110lb and it's an extremely cute jacket but it makes me look like a homeless person and if I button it up it looks even worse.,20821,1
20821,I'll probably end up giving it to my boyfriend (even though I was super excited about this jacket!),20821,1
20821,if he wants it.,20821,1
20821,He tried it on & it actually fit....He is 5'10 and 150lb so if your small beware!!!,20821,1
20821,The only place I will probably wear this is when I go camping....bummer.,20821,1
20822,"i wouldn't recommend this watch, it's pretty, sure... but i bougth mine about 4 months ago and the band broke, also the bigger handles just won't run anymore, i complained to amazon and they kindly return half of the price i paid, but the seller never answered my complains.",20822,1

20826,The bottoms were way too small and virtually unwearable in public.,20826,1
20826,The top fit O.K.,20826,1
20826,I'm stuck with a top that fits and bottoms that don't.,20826,1
20827,"way too small, and the bra is made for a 6th grader.",20827,1
20828,I've had this wallet for 3 months and the leather key chain loop that is sewn in to the wallet has torn out.,20828,1
20828,I purchased this wallet solely for the ability to clip my keys to the wallet .,20828,1
20828,The company also has horrible customer service.,20828,1
20828,Wouldn't recommend if you're buying this for the use of the key ring loop.,20828,1
20829,The sizes are way off.,20829,1
20829,I wear a six 6 and an XL is too small.,20829,1

20832,"This shirt runs so tiny, it looks very cheaply made, ill fitting, and ugly.",20832,1

20833,"The leather was so thin and not leather-looking, nor did it have the feel of leather,  that I wonder if it was really leather.",20833,1
20833,The card holder inside the bag was literally falling apart when I touched it.,20833,1
20833,A big long string came out of it and it unraveled when I touched the credit card holder.,20833,1
20833,"Oh, and the smell!",20833,1
20833,This bag had the most awful smell emanating from it!,20833,1
20833,"I can't even begin to guess what the smell was, certainly not the smell of leather, but probably some of the chemicals used in processing the ""leather"".",20833,1
20833,Huge disappointment for me. ',20833,1
20834,In all seriousness...THIS ITEM IS NOT FIT FOR A HOMELESS PERSON.,20834,1

20844,Absolutely no support.,20844,1
20845,Top--Humongous around the chest and not nearly wide enough to cover the girls.,20845,1
20845,If you wear anything larger than an A cup...you will be fighting to keep them from coming out on top and underneath!!,20845,1
20845,Bottoms-teensy weensy.,20845,1
20845,I'm not sure what kind of women they think have bodies like this...but anyone with an upper body to fit the top and a lower body to fit the bottoms they sent with the top.... surely has trouble standing upright!!!,20845,1
20845,Lol,20845,1

20855,There is no doubt that the product is cute but the size is ridiculous.,20855,1

20856,"Color pattern was different and only on exterior side, and it was not a sweater some man-made product.",20856,1

20869,This is THE ugliest dress I've ever tried on.,20869,1
20869,"First, it's IMPOSSIBLE to put on by yourself, you MUST have someone standing there for 20 mins to lace up the back.",20869,1
20869,"Then once I got it on, there was so much extra material in the mid section that it sticks out like a pooch and makes me look fat!",20869,1
20869,No form fit anywhere even with the lace up back.,20869,1
20869,The hem on the top of the bust is rolled over and looks cheap.,20869,1
20869,"Then when I went to pull it off, the inner lining isn't fully attached so pulls inside out over the dress.",20869,1
20869,Just trying this on took 30 mins...,20869,1
20869,I wear a size 10 but my measurements fit the size 12.,20869,1
20869,I have a ball in 3 days and no idea what I'm gonna do.,20869,1
20869,For $150 I expected way better quality.,20869,1
20870,Nice piece but falls off the chain after 1 day.,20870,1
20871,Fell apart when tried to put it on,20871,1
20872,Awful,20872,1
20873,couldnt even fit them over my thighs and i am normal sized,20873,1
20874,Waayyyyy too small - not for the taller population,20874,1
20875,I bought these earrings because they looked good and they were stainless steel.,20875,1
20875,After receiving them I put them in my ears and thought they would be ok even if the package didn't say.,20875,1
20875,I checked the package after my ears turned green and discovered they only said Fashion Jewelry.,20875,1
20875,"I would not recommend these earrings unless you don't react to any, any metal.",20875,1
20876,Everything about this dress would have been fabulous if the sizing were accurate.,20876,1
20876,"The dress is made well enough, the fabric is very soft and flowy but the size...ugh.",20876,1
20876,I'm disappointed!,20876,1
20877,"I like the fabric, but the briefs need a redesign, everything falls right out, I was constantly having to reach down my pants to readjust things.",20877,1
20878,Looks cheep.,20878,1
20878,Poor quality.,20878,1
20879,broke after one time wear.,20879,1
20880,I purchased a different color in the same size that fit perfect but this one was cut to small.,20880,1
20881,"Terrible disclosed,should not be sold to any one",20881,1
20882,Ordered a medium but seems as though I got an  XL,20882,1
20883,My hips are hug....so it didn't work.if u are curvy forget it....,20883,1
20884,Disappointed in the quality of material used.,20884,1
20884,The picture is bolder in color then the actual print.,20884,1
20885,Usually wear a medium.,20885,1
20885,Ordered an XL and barely could button it!,20885,1
20885,Cute shirt if you can find a size hat would work for you!,20885,1
20886,"Tons of guesswork with this unlabeled, badly packaged, jumbled mess.",20886,1
20886,Thank the gods I already had 10G rings in the bottom ear piercings.,20886,1
20886,I'll be spending more money on better quality jewelry and a piercing jewelry gauging tool next go round.,20886,1
20886,"Okay, time for an edit.",20886,1
20886,"I've opened and measured all of the jewelry, only a handful are the actual sizes listed in the description.",20886,1
20886,"Some of the larger gauge sizes have what appear to be ""ear funk"" or some other residue on them.",20886,1
20886,There are score marks on the insides of the tapers and they feel like razors in the ears.,20886,1
20886,They look nothing like the featured image for the item.,20886,1
20886,The  screw back plugs will not work if you have thick earlobes like I do.,20886,1
20886,I've seen better craftsmanship out of second grade children.,20886,1
20886,This is bound for the trash bin.,20886,1
20886,"I won't even bother with the ""free return"".",20886,1
20886,It'd be a waste of a stamp.,20886,1
20887,This product doesn't look at all like the picture.,20887,1
20887,The cut is a bikini cut and is suppose to be a booty short cut.,20887,1
20887,Material is very cheap and stitching is poor.,20887,1
20888,There is no difference between this one and the one for $12.00.,20888,1
20889,This was small enough for my  12 year old daughter.,20889,1
20889,Bad size chart.,20889,1
20890,Loose and cheap looking,20890,1
20891,Mesh pocket was already ripped when it arrived.,20891,1
20891,"Poorly made, cheap construction.",20891,1
20891,Pockets weren't very deep.,20891,1
20891,Would not recommend.,20891,1
20892,Saying this was to small is an understatement!,20892,1
20892,I normally wear a XL shirt.,20892,1
20892,After reading reviews in ordered up 2 sizes.,20892,1
20892,So 3xl.,20892,1
20892,Not sure who they measure when sizing this shirt but it was Not a 3xl.,20892,1
20892,Maybe a medium at best.,20892,1
20893,Don't even buy.,20893,1
20893,Fingers and rings green after one wear.,20893,1
20894,This is the smallest medium I've ever wore in my life.,20894,1
20895,like the bracket.,20895,1
20895,"Took out of the package n it,was broken  came appart.",20895,1
20895,returning ir.,20895,1
20896,Too tight on breast area.,20896,1

20897,Sizing way off.,20897,1
20898,the paint was faded and they are huge,20898,1
20899,The color I got is completely different from the color  advertised in the pics .,20899,1
20900,I actually like the bracelet design but it arrived tarnished and I had to return it.,20900,1
20900,I don't think a new item should come tarnished.,20900,1
20901,Very flimsy.,20901,1
20901,"All strings of elastic split, this ring is literally hanging by a thread.",20901,1
20902,The post on this item was very weak.,20902,1
20902,Mine came broken and I had to return it.,20902,1
20903,This was a XXL and way to small.,20903,1
20903,I never had good luck buying clothes online.,20903,1
20903,Gave it to my mom which fit her just right and she is a small lady.,20903,1
20904,These pants were not what I expected at all.,20904,1
20904,I am an average size and they were very tight.,20904,1
20904,"I cannot imagine how they are listed as ""one size fits all.""",20904,1
20904,The worst part is that they gray areas (on the sides) are see through.,20904,1
20904,There is no way I could use these pants.,20904,1
20904,I will sadly be returning them.,20904,1
20905,"BROKEN IN THE FIRST TRY, BAD MATERIAL",20905,1
20906,Waaaaaaay undersized.,20906,1
20906,I ordered by the sizechart and the pants aren't half as big as they advertised.,20906,1
20906,The pants are also very short.,20906,1
20907,"It is very small , the seams are very poorly developed , were not as expected and appreciated in the photos.",20907,1
20907,very disenchanted,20907,1
20908,Dislike,20908,1
20909,"it was itchy to me, I am still waiting for my refund it has been a couple of months.",20909,1
20910,HUGE!!!,20910,1
20910,Youth xs could fit a 10 year old.,20910,1
20911,Cheap,20911,1
20912,my sweet husband bought me this purse not knowing that it was not authentic and he paid more than he wouldve at an Coach outlet.,20912,1
20912,"cheaply made, but i'm still going to use it because its the thought that counts",20912,1
20913,Cheap material,20913,1
20914,"The under slip was too small,  and the tulle flared out, and was almost 6-7inches longer than the slip.",20914,1
20914,"There was only 2 layers of tulle, making the skirt completely see-through.",20914,1
20914,The skirt looked nothing like pictured.,20914,1
20915,This color had an additional band in the waist that my first pair of black pants did not have.,20915,1
20915,This extra band makes the waist WAY too tight and uncomfortable.,20915,1
20915,I wish it was the old design.,20915,1
20915,Not happy with the fit on these.,20915,1
20916,I order a 3X and it was so small I could not button it.,20916,1
20916,Normally a 3X is too big.,20916,1
20916,"The quality was good
But I was so disappointed.",20916,1
20916,"Did not send it back because I threw away the packaging being certain
The size would fit.",20916,1
20916,This product was made in China which may be the reason why the sizing was off.,20916,1
20917,"Necklace poorly designed, all the crystals  was off  i received the package .Not happy at all.",20917,1
20918,"See through and the material is awful, itchy, and hot.",20918,1

20922,"It was so cute, but the cat charm broke and fell off within a week.",20922,1
20922,"It was lost, so now I am left with only a metal ring :(",20922,1
20923,Wow.,20923,1
20923,The shirt I received is NOT by Simply Southern at all.,20923,1
20923,"It is 100% cheap, slippery polyester fabric, with cheap white threading half on and half off the shirt.",20923,1
20923,"It was listed as in stock, in the USA.",20923,1
20923,"Instead after I bought it, it took weeks to get here and came from China and is SOO obviously a knockoff.",20923,1
20923,NOT EVEN close.. in any way.,20923,1
20923,"Sad, because it was my daughters Christmas present.",20923,1
20923,DO NOT ORDER.,20923,1

20926,"Cheap material, the large was an American small.",20926,1
20926,Went straight to goodwill,20926,1
20927,It looks like the picture I guess but the wallet is huge compared to the one I have now.,20927,1
20927,The card slot don't even make sense.,20927,1
20927,I'll try to explain.,20927,1
20927,Basically instead of having a staggering effect when all three slots are full.,20927,1
20927,You get the very bottom card covering the middle card so you can't even tell there is a second card.,20927,1
20927,"Not to mention it took 3 weeks to get the
Item.",20927,1
20927,Just not what I expected I guess,20927,1
20928,"The outfit was not as ""fitted"" as I had hoped, or as the picture indicated.",20928,1
20928,"The shirt was ok, but that pants fit baggy like a pair of ordinary sweatpants, not skinny leg as the pic shows.",20928,1

20928,"140lbs, in shape, and well proportioned.",20928,1
20928,"I ordered a Medium, which is my true size.",20928,1
20928,"I think this outfit was true to size, I would NOT recommend ordering a size up.",20928,1
20928,I would have been much happier if the actual style of the outfit I received matched the style in the picture.,20928,1
20928,"Also, some of my zippers would not function, and that is aggravating as it is the appeal of the whole getup.",20928,1
20929,"It was very pretty, but broke the first time wearing.",20929,1
20930,HATE IT,20930,1
20931,Not at all what I was expecting.,20931,1
20931,It was very thin.,20931,1

20935,Ordered the biggest size possible and it's still small,20935,1
20936,Quality is not good because it is the first to wear it ruined the raw material is not good,20936,1
20937,AWFUL NOBODY BUY THIS,20937,1
20938,I'm American made.,20938,1

20938,Sorry but wow!!!,20938,1
20938,!,20938,1
20939,"Although I like the style and fit, it came with holes and ripped stitching.",20939,1
20939,Thoroughly disappointed.,20939,1
20939,Threw it out.,20939,1
20940,"This item did arrive quickly, however, when I took it out of the plastic the whole outfit smelled like some sort of terrible mold.",20940,1
20940,It's absolutely nauseating.,20940,1
20940,I purchased this for my niece and I wouldn't want her breathing near it let alone wearing it.,20940,1
20940,Such a shame because the outfit itself is really cute.,20940,1
20940,What a disappointment.,20940,1
20941,I can't see out of these glasses,20941,1
20942,Wasn't happy on the fit,20942,1
20943,The purse had an odd sell to it.,20943,1
20943,None of the hardware matched on it.,20943,1
20943,Some of it was a rose gold color and some of it was yellow.,20943,1
20943,Not worth the price.,20943,1
20944,This is supposed to be identical to pink one I previously ordered.,20944,1
20944,I can't get it beyond my neck!,20944,1
20944,Very disappointed!,20944,1
20945,To be completely accurate on how the sizing on this is it should be in youth sizes.,20945,1
20945,Think tween sizing.,20945,1
20945,Not to mention it's more like the material used on a rug.,20945,1
20945,If I could leave no or negative stars I would.,20945,1
20946,Dress was too small,20946,1
20947,silver came off within a week it's brass looking now.,20947,1

20952,Steer clear-im giving it a 1 star so everyone interested will read this.,20952,1
20952,If I could give it less I would.,20952,1
20952,I ordered this a size larger than any other swearshirt I own and it's smaller than the rest.,20952,1
20952,Quality is awful-no front pocket--thin material.,20952,1
20952,Came with no return form.,20952,1
20952,Never again.,20952,1
20953,I thought this was similar to the Tommie Copper compression socks.,20953,1
20953,There is absolutely no compression.,20953,1
20953,It doesn't help with swelling or tension on flights.,20953,1
20953,I am very disappointed.,20953,1
20954,The size does not look true to picture.,20954,1
20954,The fabric is super thin without a tag.,20954,1

20955,"Did not fit properly, and the top is poor quality where the straps go into.",20955,1
20956,Don't bother buying these earrings.,20956,1
20956,Mine stuck straight out and didn't lay flat on my ears like they're supposed to and looked absolutely ridiculous.,20956,1
20956,"Then when I was gently trying to take them off, the stem completely snapped off and broke.",20956,1
20956,I had to throw them out within minutes of opening my package.,20956,1
20956,Total waste of money.,20956,1
20957,Nothing like in the pictures!,20957,1
20958,way too small!,20958,1
20958,and too expensive,20958,1
20959,The design was cool and it fit fine but the first wash the whole pattern peeled off.,20959,1
20959,"There's a ghost outline if the design that is actually sort of a cool subtle image, but not what i purchased.",20959,1
20959,They need to use silk screening or another form of printing.,20959,1
20959,The quality of this one is not one they should be comfortable selling.,20959,1
20959,I don't regret the purchase because the ghost image is kinda cool.,20959,1
20959,But still.,20959,1
20960,color is not as brilliant as pictures on amazon,20960,1
20961,Broke immediately.,20961,1

20963,The graphics weren't centered and didn't even have the Hylete logo down the middle of the back as depicted.,20963,1
20963,"If you find a legitimate seller of a real Hylete shirt, I recommend, but this was a total letdown.",20963,1
20963,"Then I contacted the seller for a refund, he never got back to me.",20963,1
20963,Amazon settled with a gift card instead.,20963,1
20964,Hand made.,20964,1
20964,Not impress.,20964,1
20964,Very cheap looking.,20964,1

20972,The quality of this pillow case was quite disappointing.,20972,1
20972,The only way that the graphics would look clean and clear would be from about 25 yards out!,20972,1
20973,The fabric was too scratchy and thin.,20973,1
20973,It hugs your body but the fabric was not comfortable to wear .,20973,1

20980,I ordered this expecting the article of clothing to be what I see in the photo of the product.,20980,1
20980,"Instead, I received a sheer (as sheer as nude pantyhose) piece of polyester fabric with a hole in the center.",20980,1
20980,The sides are not sewn and the edges are poorly serged as the only finishing on the fabric edges..,20980,1

20989,"And by the way, i had ordered a XL.",20989,1
20990,I ordered it bigger than my normal size and I couldn't even get it over my head!!,20990,1
20990,Very disappointed!,20990,1
20990,!,20990,1
20991,the boots are hard to walk in if you're not used to walking in some thing near ballet boots as far as heel height.,20991,1
20991,I bought shoe size 12+ and the 3 straps that come with the boots are useless.,20991,1
20991,They are supposed to be at the top of the boots but don't fit and are too short in length to be of any use at all.,20991,1
20991,Only get these if you're into fetish play all the way!,20991,1
20992,Aweful quality.,20992,1
20992,I bought this for my teenage daughter and I would die if she actually wore it.,20992,1
20992,It's practically see through,20992,1
20993,No composite belt will hold up as an everyday work belt.,20993,1
20993,This is composit leather not top grain.,20993,1
20993,The buckle is sewn on instead of using snaps.,20993,1
20994,"looks like something you would wear to the gym, and only the gym.",20994,1
20994,"not fit to wear out for real, unless you enjoy looking cheap.",20994,1
20995,Just received this today and looks nothing like the photo.,20995,1
20995,SO incredibly disappointed.,20995,1
20995,Returning it asap!,20995,1
20996,This didn't look good on me.,20996,1
20996,I am barely 5' & weigh 120.,20996,1
20996,This vest went passed my knees and did not compliment my body at all.,20996,1
20996,It looked like a big blanket that covers my entire body.,20996,1
20996,I wear a small in shirts.,20996,1
20996,I think for someone tall it would look great just make sure you order it a size or two smaller.,20996,1
20997,Watch broke.,20997,1
20997,Sent it back.,20997,1
20998,The material was more like cheap plastic sent it back the same day I opened it.,20998,1

20999,I usually wear a small but I purchased a large.,20999,1
20999,This is smaller than children's clothing!,20999,1
20999,"This isn't even just a little small, it's barely fit over your head, stops just under your bra, skin tight small.",20999,1
21000,Not worth the money.,21000,1
21000,Hasn't helped my feet one bit and they don't fit properly according to their size chart.,21000,1
21001,Was not what the picture indicated.,21001,1
21001,Will not buy from them again,21001,1
21002,"These were pretty small diamonds, nothing impressive.",21002,1
21002,I feel bad as they were a gift from my husband.,21002,1
21002,The issue is that the backings were made so loose they would slip off.,21002,1
21002,"I'd push them back to fit again, but the backings didn't fit the earrings.",21002,1
21002,"This resulted in the earrings falling off one day and getting lost, so unable to return a product that literally--disappeared.",21002,1
21002,"Awful, do not trust this seller.",21002,1
21002,Cheaply made.,21002,1
21003,The description of the product did not match what we received,21003,1

21005,"This suit is not sized correctly, thick tight, elastic under inset bra and cups are misshapen.",21005,1
21006,Broke when removing from packaging,21006,1
21007,little sister ripped it right off my ankle,21007,1
21008,It Was Too Small,21008,1
21009,"Cheap but cute clothes are nice to find but the fabric is very low quality, semi see-through and staticky.",21009,1
21009,"I can guarantee I won't wear it again, don't spend $5 on a dress online.",21009,1
21010,This shirt should not say that it fits smaller than expected.,21010,1
21010,It has very tight arms.,21010,1
21010,But is cut for some one with very large shoulders.,21010,1
21010,It is baggy every where but the arms.,21010,1
21010,Was very disappointed.,21010,1
21011,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture and seems to run in child's size.,21011,1
21011,Awful,21011,1
21012,"It is a beautiful top, but the L fit like a S. I've had to return it.",21012,1
21013,The gem in the heart was super tiny.,21013,1
21013,We bought both the amethyst and diamond necklace.,21013,1
21013,The gem size was so small you could barely tell the difference between the two gems.,21013,1
21014,I'm very disappointed because I had high expectations for these tights.,21014,1
21014,"I am 200 pounds and 5'4"" and these were too small!!",21014,1
21014,I purchased the black pair and the gray pair because I felt they would fit perfectly.,21014,1
21014,They barely made it over my hips so I am unable to wear them.,21014,1
21015,Not at all what I expected.,21015,1
21015,It's 2 pieces of metal with a big rubber band.,21015,1
21015,Hard to get cards out and even harder to get your money.,21015,1
21015,Not worth it,21015,1
21016,It's too small in the upper area and the fabric feels cheap.,21016,1
21017,"Way too small, child size.",21017,1
21018,"Beautiful piece, but not well made.",21018,1
21018,Broke too easily.,21018,1
21018,Returned.,21018,1
21019,It appears to be stamped out metal.,21019,1
21019,Sharp edges.,21019,1
21019,Not a smooth aluminum wallet as the Shark or other brands.,21019,1
21019,Not sure where the top rated thing comes from but I was not impressed with the price or quality.,21019,1
21019,JUNK...,21019,1
21020,The chain was broken,21020,1
21021,My regular size is 7 but reviews said they ran small.,21021,1

21021,Very dissappointed,21021,1
21022,Ordered a 34X30.,21022,1
21022,They ended up being 30X34.,21022,1
21022,The legs are HUGE and you can fit both your legs in one of the pant legs.,21022,1
21023,This is the absolute cheapest piece of garbage that I have ever wasted my five dollars on.,21023,1
21023,"The edges look like they were cut with scissors, the design is printed on in very low quality and even has ink smudging all over the white areas.",21023,1
21023,It looks nothing like the photo and is a complete rip off.,21023,1
21023,Amazon should be ashamed to list you as a seller.,21023,1
21024,WAY too small!,21024,1
21024,!,21024,1
21025,Does Not deserve a starTooooooooooooo small,21025,1

21027,Very poor quality,21027,1

21029,Definitely disappointed.,21029,1
21030,"fabric not as described, not for office very thin and silky.. iddn't expect that.",21030,1

21034,But the material?,21034,1
21034,It says cotton under the description.,21034,1
21034,THIS IS NOT COTTON.,21034,1
21034,It's a see through chiffon fabric.,21034,1
21034,I bought this thinking it was cotton cause I'm going away to somewhere chilly but it's not.,21034,1
21034,It's see through.,21034,1
21034,"It was good to show skin with the cheap lacing they provided, but to see everything even my nipples , is a turn off.",21034,1
21034,I bought a medium (usually wear a small) but I wanted it to be a little loose but it's super tight on my upper arm area.,21034,1
21034,"I'm pretty sure the more you wear it, it'll tear.",21034,1

21036,It was for her Sweet 16 party and the dress that came was not the same dress that's in the picture.,21036,1
21036,While similar you can't really compare it to the picture.,21036,1

21036,Sending this back ASAP.,21036,1
21037,Beautiful saree but got it ripped,21037,1
21038,Top waaaay too small and bottoms ridiculously oversized.,21038,1

21039,"Beautiful when you first open the box and try them on, but one mild walk with my 3-year old and noses of the shoes are ripped.",21039,1
21039,This has not been a problem with other brand shoes!!!,21039,1

21046,"I tried to fix it, and when I used it a second time, the same piece broke plus a second piece broke off completely.",21046,1
21046,Not to mention the fact that it doesn't stay closed either.,21046,1
21046,"Again, do not waste money buying this.",21046,1
21047,Received a shirt not even similar to what I ordered!!!,21047,1

21049,"Its cute, but.",21049,1
21049,It smells horrible.,21049,1
21049,The zipper does not work properly.,21049,1

21049,I did not feel it was worth returning at my cost.,21049,1
21050,Way too small and not what I was looking for with regards to support in a sports bra.,21050,1

21105,"Very different than the picture,  very cheap material, and very small.",21105,1
21105,I was so excited to get it  and was very disappointed.,21105,1
21106,I have purchased Havaianas in the past.,21106,1
21106,I ordered these in the same size I always get.,21106,1
21106,"For some reason, the straps on top were way too wide and one shoe has looser straps that the other.",21106,1
21106,I couldn't walk in the shoes.,21106,1
21106,I'm afraid to size down because I don't want them to be too short.,21106,1
21106,I feel like these aren't consistent with the Havaianas sold in stores.,21106,1
21107,Not an off shoulder sweater.,21107,1
21107,The shoulder arm seams are just pulled down to sides.,21107,1
21108,Very cheap did not like quality,21108,1
21109,broke the first time I wore them and I had to pay to send back.,21109,1

21115,Material is like wearing a tight parachute.,21115,1
21116,Very ugly bad choice plus bad quality,21116,1

21117,These would probably fit an 8 year old child.,21117,1
21118,it looked great out of the box and I did get a lot of compliments on the hombre look... however the dress material came undone within the first 2 hours of wearing it.,21118,1
21118,I had to improvise with adding a pin to keep it together.,21118,1
21118,what a disappointment.,21118,1
21118,at the end of the day I threw it out like a cheap costume.,21118,1
21119,"When I received the hat the design was all messed up, it looked nothing like it did in the picture.",21119,1
21119,& was all bent & folded when I opened the package.,21119,1
21120,Flimsy- not worth the investment.,21120,1
21121,This Dress Hugged Me Way Too Tight!,21121,1
21121,I Only Bought Because A Bride Wanted Me To Wear It!,21121,1
21121,Haha.,21121,1
21121,It Ripped The First Time I Wore It And I Did Get A Refund But By The Time I Payed To Ship To Me And Back I Probably Paid More.,21121,1
21121,Really Wouldn't Recommend.,21121,1
21122,It fits weird and I'm really disappointed.,21122,1
21123,"I bought the dress for a wedding, but VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED!",21123,1

21124,"I found this item searching for the Moto 360 and not only did it not fit it was scratched, greesed up ( like someone was playing with while eating fried chicken)  and had a huge rust damage",21124,1
21125,This outfit was a joke.,21125,1
21125,I was disappointed in it.,21125,1
21125,"In fact I wondered, if they sent me the wrong thing because I received another item.",21125,1
21125,Couldn't wear either.,21125,1

21126,I didn't like the way the zipper looks open.,21126,1

21127,"It's not plated, it's copper paint over a black band.",21127,1
21127,The black color is painted on and wearing off right out of the box.,21127,1

21130,"The top is not a crop, it is a bra.",21130,1
21130,"The size was way too big, most likely because the material is not stretchy...it is like a giant loose bag.",21130,1
21130,"Ridiculous, but I guess it is what you pay for...",21130,1
21131,Zero rating,21131,1
21132,Terrible construction.,21132,1

21132,The wires can snag and bulbs pull out too easy.,21132,1
21132,Battery pack too large.,21132,1
21132,It needs three (3) AA batteries.,21132,1
21132,"Almost all the other lighted sweaters use ""watch batteries"".",21132,1
21132,Hopefully we can find something to use as a liner and cover up all the wires.,21132,1

21229,Very disappointed too small.,21229,1
21229,Got a large and definetly was more like a small maybe medium.,21229,1
21229,Tried to send it back but got an email that was confusing and weird.,21229,1
21229,So it went to my local salvation army.,21229,1
21230,horrible-very cheap material and cheaply made,21230,1
21231,Fit great !,21231,1
21231,Was keeping them for Halloween!,21231,1
21231,Already sent a pair back with hole in them!!,21231,1
21231,"Took tags of yesterday to wear the pair I kept, fingers went thru them like paper!",21231,1
21231,Never ever had any trouble with any leggings I have ordered from Amazon!,21231,1
21231,I figure they are dry rotted.,21231,1
21231,I wonder if I could sent them back?,21231,1
21231,?,21231,1
21232,"Impossible to open, clasp is short and it hurts to push it in far enough to open!",21232,1
21233,The piece was broken and three sections when I opened it.,21233,1
21233,It is beautiful but what can I do if its broken.,21233,1
21234,The buyer canceled the order,21234,1
21235,Not for swimming!,21235,1
21235,Thin material and no support.,21235,1
21236,Not real handmade leather as advertised,21236,1
21237,The label said XL but it was closer to Medium...,21237,1
21237,It is beautiful and I was very disappointed in the sizing.,21237,1
21238,Wore and the first day I got a huge hole where the seem is and it was super lose on me.,21238,1
21238,I am 5.2 and 150 lbs for a plus size they were weirdly short but lose and ripped the first night.,21238,1
21238,Waste of money.,21238,1
21238,Won't be buying from them again.,21238,1
21239,"Searched ""Adult Wolverine Costume"".",21239,1
21239,Found the seller.,21239,1
21239,Read the item description & size chart.,21239,1
21239,"Selected size ""XL"".",21239,1
21239,Didn't realize that the item description changed based on size selected.,21239,1
21239,"Purchased the item for ""$29.64"".",21239,1
21239,"A child's XL showed up, which obviously did not fit.",21239,1
21239,Returned the item (I was excited they had free returns since it isn't prime) and was refunded $11.75.,21239,1
21239,"If I would have known how little I would get back, I would have saved the costume for when my children were older.",21239,1
21239,"I did end up buying an adult larger of the same costume from a different seller and it worked well, although it was very difficult to see through the eyes.",21239,1
21239,"I ended up cutting the head off and re-sewing the zipper, which worked out very well.",21239,1
21240,This top was way to small !,21240,1
21240,For the add saying plus size !,21240,1
21240,I gave it to s close friend that was wears a 12 top !,21240,1
21240,Will not be shopping with your company again,21240,1
21241,Sizes are SUPER small and I'm a really small female.,21241,1
21241,"Ordered a medium and it was decent fitting, but this dress was horribly made!",21241,1
21241,Incredibly uneven and lopsided.,21241,1
21241,It would have been super cute if it has been stitched together properly.,21241,1
21241,They were really nice and fully refunded me right away.,21241,1
21241,Wish it would have worked out though.,21241,1
21242,Don't like this purse at all.,21242,1
21242,Looks cheap and the design is terrible.,21242,1
21242,I decided to give this purse to my 10 year old daughter to play dress up with.,21242,1
21242,It is really gigantic.,21242,1
21243,This item is nothing like the picture.,21243,1
21243,It was so far off I thought it was shipped to me in error.,21243,1
21243,I will be returning!,21243,1
21243,If I could give zero stars I would.,21243,1
21244,Never buy nothing to this sealler,21244,1
21245,Too sheer.,21245,1
21245,Could wear came with it but defeats the purpose of the blouse,21245,1
21246,Did not fit my phone.,21246,1
21246,I have the note 5 and it was too small.,21246,1
21246,And they wouldn't let me return it because they said it was the right case.... well it wasn't because it clearly didn't fit!,21246,1
21246,-5 stars.,21246,1
21247,Buyer beware.,21247,1
21247,Major design flaw in this item.,21247,1
21247,The neck opening is not big enough to fit over my head & there is no clasp or stretch to speak of.,21247,1
21247,In the XXL it is 19 inch opening.,21247,1
21247,My head is 21.,21247,1
21247,"I showed it to a tailor who said to send it back, he wouldn't even touch it.",21247,1
21247,I am a little handy with a sewing machine and was able to fix it myself by cutting the back of the neck and creating a lined placket with a hook and eye closure.,21247,1
21247,but I spent far more time on it than I would have expected.,21247,1
21247,Would not purchase this item again.,21247,1
21247,Very cute but the sizing runs way too small.,21247,1
21248,We bought this as a bridesmaid dress.,21248,1
21248,"However, the picture provided does not remotely reflect the dress itself.",21248,1
21248,"First, the dress is very sheer, which is not mentioned anywhere on the product listing.",21248,1
21248,"Also, the color does not match the picture.",21248,1
21248,It is not anywhere close to being the golden yellow that is portrayed in the picture; its instead a very pale yellow.,21248,1
21248,The fabric is also very low quality and would not likely survive much of anything in regards to wear/tear.,21248,1
21248,I would absolutely not recommend this product.,21248,1
21249,It was smallish and of an unknown fabric.,21249,1
21249,No tag to tell what it was made of.,21249,1
21249,Almost gave it to my granddaughter to play in but was worried it was not fire retardant.,21249,1
21249,It felt crunchy and weird.,21249,1
21249,Didn't smell good either.,21249,1
21249,I trashed it.,21249,1
21250,Came apart the moment I took it out of the packaging.,21250,1
21250,Poorly soddered.,21250,1
21251,The first necklace I ordered as a gift was beautiful.,21251,1
21251,"I then ordered one for me unlike the first one where the stone matched the crystals in blue, this necklace was a great disappointment.",21251,1
21251,"The ""green"" stone did not match blue crystals at all.",21251,1
21251,I doubt I will be ordering from this company again as confident in product look.,21251,1
21251,You would think being a repeat customer they would try to match stones better for second purchase.,21251,1
21252,I ordered XL and it it's soooo small that I had to give it to my 10 year old cousin.,21252,1
21252,I put 1 star bcuz  0 is not an option.,21252,1
21253,Do not buy this.,21253,1
21253,It is the size of a shirt not a cover up.,21253,1
21253,"Horrible waste of money !,,",21253,1
21254,Today was the first day I used this purse considering I got it yesterday.,21254,1
21254,I did not expect the strap to already break.,21254,1
21254,I don't even have a lot of items in it.,21254,1
21254,Very disappointed,21254,1
21255,This does not look like the picture at all.,21255,1
21255,The sizing is way to small.,21255,1
21255,Very thin material.,21255,1

21257,So I gave it to my girlfriend.,21257,1
21258,Does not fit as promised in the size guide,21258,1
21259,I was under the impression that these where post earings!,21259,1
21259,They are hook backs!,21259,1
21259,Impossible to keep for long upright like you have in the picture!!!!,21259,1
21259,CHEAPLY DONE!,21259,1
21259,You get what you buy!,21259,1

21261,I ordered a medium!!!,21261,1
21261,"Very, very small Can NOT wear",21261,1
21262,Not what is in the picture....,21262,1
21262,The quality is horrible!!!!!,21262,1
21262,It would cost to much to send it back (I should have payed more attention to where it was coming from...,21262,1
21262,Lesson learned) I'm an average size and most dresses size medium fit a little big...,21262,1
21262,I ordered a Large!!!,21262,1
21262,I can't even get it zipped.,21262,1
21262,It shows in the picture it comes to her knees (well almost).,21262,1
21262,It barely covered my bottom (if I could zip it I wouldn't dare bend over!),21262,1
21263,Too LARGE,21263,1
21264,"Is too small, is for a size person XS.",21264,1
21265,"The picture makes this dress look simple and elegant, it turns out to be quite the opposite.",21265,1
21265,"It is poofy and looks like something out of a disney film, don't waste your money as I did (there are NO returns!)",21265,1
21265,and look elsewhere.,21265,1
21266,Don't be fooled.,21266,1
21266,It's not make out of cotton.,21266,1
21266,They must use bamboo fiber.,21266,1
21266,You can practically see thru it.,21266,1
21266,Better to be worn at night and in bed.,21266,1
21266,Feels more like it should be worn for bedtime.,21266,1
21266,Collar to too big around the neck.,21266,1
21266,Shows to much skin.,21266,1
21266,"If I knew this, I wouldn't buy it.",21266,1
21267,I suggest getting a really bigger size.,21267,1
21267,I'm a medium and I bought a large and it was super small on me where my arms couldn't move.,21267,1
21267,It's cute but too small.,21267,1
21268,This bag doesn't really look like the picture.,21268,1
21268,The straps are too short and the bag itself is huge.,21268,1
21268,Also it has a very weird smell and i couldn't carry it.,21268,1
21268,It just didn't work for me.,21268,1
21268,I returned it.,21268,1
21269,Seams ripped after one wash.,21269,1
21270,I should have ordered a small.,21270,1
21271,The color of shows it to be a cream shirt and it's an ugly yellow.,21271,1

21272,"No steel bone, fake.",21272,1
21273,Way too small.,21273,1
21273,It took about a month to get it by mail so the hell with returning it.,21273,1
21273,It is also not a racer back like in the picture or description.,21273,1
21274,poorly constructed,21274,1
21275,I emailed the seller immediately after placing my order because their pictures and descriptions did not match for color choices.,21275,1
21275,"I emailed them and specifically said i ordered the ""white swimsuit"" even though the picture showed blue, and that i wanted the white selection.",21275,1
21275,They emailed me back in broken English saying i would get the white suit and to be patient (came across rude).,21275,1
21275,"After waiting an Insane amount of time, the BLUE suit arrived.",21275,1
21275,"It fit horrifically, I'm a size 2, small build.",21275,1
21275,"The fabric was cheap, too short (I'm only 5'2""), but baggy everywhere else.",21275,1
21275,I felt like I was squeezing into an x-large child's suit.,21275,1
21275,Not flattering at all.,21275,1
21275,"It wasn't even worth my time to send it back, I threw it away.",21275,1
21275,I WILL NOT be ordering from them again.,21275,1

21278,Have to contact seller because I can't even where them they are to tiny...,21278,1

21283,"I wish I would have read the reviews,  and saw the pictures posted.",21283,1
21283,"I thought this was a SWEATER dress, and it is NOT.",21283,1
21283,"It is a weird fabric, and very flimsy material.",21283,1
21283,"My husband bought this for me, and while I love the cut out detail on the chest, the overall feel of the fabric takes away from it.",21283,1
21283,Not even worth sending back though..... :'(,21283,1
21284,Ordered a L fits more like a small.,21284,1
21284,Definitely not true to size.,21284,1
21284,Will return,21284,1
21285,Arrived damaged,21285,1
21286,Can't wear it without a camisole and has the most tedious little stretchy fasteners for the buttons.,21286,1
21286,"I wouldn't buy this again, but don't have the patience to send it back to the other side of the world",21286,1
21287,The top is cut weird and it's super unflattering.,21287,1
21287,Not a product I'd recommend.,21287,1
21288,"Product was broken, packaging insufficient!!!!!!",21288,1
21288,!,21288,1
21289,Loved the fit but the dress isee through--you can even see the inserts!,21289,1
21289,So crazy!,21289,1
21290,All that I can say is you better have a body like the model in the picture to fill this thing out and it appears to be made for someone 6 feet tall!,21290,1
21291,would not recamend.. way to tight.,21291,1
21291,will not wear them,21291,1
21292,"Material is as expected, great thin denim.",21292,1
21292,The jumpsuit is way too small in bust area.,21292,1
21292,It's a very strange fit.,21292,1
21292,I'm an A cup and it was a squeeze for me.,21292,1
21292,"Shocked, as that is never a problem.",21292,1
21292,So returning it.,21292,1
21293,"According to the sizing scale I should have been a size Medium, however, to be safe I ordered one size up (a Large).",21293,1
21293,First of all it came ripped and second of all saying the sizing is WAY off is an understatement.,21293,1
21293,They must have been using the scale in regards to children's clothes...,21293,1
21294,NEED TO BUY ONE SIZE LARGER THAN WHAT ONE WOULD NORMALLY ORDER,21294,1
21295,This suit is very heavy dry.,21295,1
21295,"I haven't used it yet, so I'm curious how it will be when wet.",21295,1
21295,"Also, this suit runs really small.",21295,1
21296,Ridiculously small.,21296,1
21297,Poor quality changed color after 1 wear,21297,1
21298,Runs small I normally wear a large I ordered and XL and that fit pretty good.,21298,1
21298,The color is definitely not the same!,21298,1
21298,Although this color yellow(almost a butter cream) is my favorite color I was looking for something more brighter yellow like in the photo!,21298,1
21298,The material is very thin defiantly needs a slip underneath.,21298,1
21298,"I bought this dress for the horse races, this dress was absolutely stunning online but a huge disappointment once it arrived.",21298,1
21299,"It was a piece of junk, not what I was expecting.",21299,1
21299,"It was much smaller than I thought, and not constructed very well.",21299,1
21300,"I really wanted this dress to work, however the straps were way to narrow to cover the essentials as shown in the pictures.",21300,1
21301,This shirt was like a child's size.,21301,1
21301,Very misleading,21301,1
21302,I would return if I didn't have to pay shipping.,21302,1
21302,The sleeves are tight and the body is baggy and just no shape.,21302,1
21303,CHEAP/FAKE,21303,1
21304,I selected a size small.,21304,1
21304,I even emailed the person and told them I needed a small and they emailed me back saying they would send me a small.,21304,1
21304,They still sent a large and the material is completely see through.,21304,1
21304,The dress is horrible.,21304,1
21305,Not the same dress as the picture the I got was cheaply made and the material was very thin,21305,1
21306,Too small.,21306,1
21306,I had to return the shorts.,21306,1
21307,what a joke.,21307,1
21307,This shirt was a double to triple extra large not even close.,21307,1
21307,I ordered an extra large and I am 5 11 and 235 and this shirt was made for a circus clown.,21307,1
21307,Thankfully I found someone to sell it to.,21307,1
21307,"no more buying clothes on line, to many bad experiences.",21307,1
21307,Hey manufactures get your damn sizes right it isn't that hard.,21307,1
21308,I received the first product about 2 weeks ago to help with my postpartum tummy.,21308,1
21308,I went by the sizing chart provided not the Amazon chart.,21308,1
21308,It arrived too small.,21308,1
21308,I am a reasonable person so no biggie I just processed the return and re ordered.,21308,1
21308,So I just received my second waist trainer.,21308,1
21308,It fit well and comfortable and I wore it all day.,21308,1
21308,Went to take it off and the zipper broke after one wear.,21308,1
21309,never gave this product,21309,1
21310,These are are of the absolute thinnest material I've ever seen.,21310,1
21310,Ordered and extra large as the reviews said they run small hoping they'd fit for the majority of maternity...these would run small for a child!,21310,1
21310,"The elastic sucks, the ribbon is too short, they're shaped almost opposite of the picture, and the pants only come down to the bottom of my calf (I'm 5'5"").",21310,1
21311,Pretty but is flimsy for a collar necklace,21311,1
21312,"This was suppose to be for a Man, it barely fit my small wrist.",21312,1
21312,"There were no size options and when it came it was just a piece of junk, the top where the skulls are doesn't line up with the bottom clasp.",21312,1
21312,"It's all cock-eyed, can't tell what kind of material it's made out of, seems like some kind of plastic doesn't feel or look like leather.",21312,1
21312,"Felt terrible giving this as a gift, won't and haven't recommended it to anyone I know, and my Husband doesn't wear it...or should I say, can't wear it.",21312,1
21312,No doubt made in China!,21312,1
21313,This shirt was WAY to small.,21313,1
21313,"When I ordered a large, and I usually order a medium, I couldn't even get it to fit on my arms.",21313,1
21313,"The shipping cost to send this back was ridiculous and I would've ended up with less than a dollar in return, so I gave it to my 14 year old sister and it fits her perfectly.",21313,1
21313,Very disappointed.,21313,1
21314,Broke the first time I put it on,21314,1
21315,Do not order!!!,21315,1
21315,"Nothing like what is pictured.. super thin, cheap, clingy material.. not baggy at all... doesn't deserve 1 star rating...",21315,1
21316,way bigger than I expected.,21316,1
21316,very nice purse but way to big for what I wanted.,21316,1
21316,wanted the smaller version of this,21316,1
21317,Not authentic HD as the product page leads you to believe.,21317,1
21317,Shirt is not as pictured.,21317,1
21317,"I ordered a 2XL, but the shirt I received came from China and resembles that of a woman's med/large shirt with a low neck line to show off the goods.",21317,1
21317,Do not order.,21317,1
21317,Save your money.,21317,1

21319,"too big, no pockets, logo misplaced",21319,1
21320,TERRBLE,21320,1
21321,Too small,21321,1
21322,This has got to be some sort of joke.,21322,1
21322,I specifically ordered an XXL so it would be loose fitting.,21322,1
21322,This shirt fits my 8 year old.,21322,1
21322,REALLY!?!?!?,21322,1
21322,The only reason I'm not returning it is because she loves it.,21322,1
21322,Wondering if they shipped a children's shirt.,21322,1
21323,I purchased a medium and it fits like a large.,21323,1
21323,Very cheap material.,21323,1
21323,Does not look like the picture.,21323,1
21324,"I was so happy that the vendor was able to get it before Christmas (shipped from China) however, the material was poor quality.",21324,1
21324,I ordered a size large and it was so tight on my husband and the sleeves dwnt to the middle of his forearm.,21324,1
21324,We ended up giving it to our petite 17 year old daughter and it fits her well.,21324,1
21324,It also had dirt marks on the hood (that I was able to get out in the wash) and a mark on the yellow part of the O.,21324,1
21324,As soon as I washed it the design at the front became faded.,21324,1
21324,The O is now a pale yellow.,21324,1
21325,Not what I expected.,21325,1
21325,I expected it to be bigger and more roomy.,21325,1
21326,its to short is weird!,21326,1

21327,The shirt is too wide and short,21327,1
21328,"Doesn't fit right, way to small in the arms",21328,1
21329,To big,21329,1
21330,"I just got this dress today, and it was waaaaaay to small.",21330,1
21330,Who's idea of a XXL is this.,21330,1
21330,The arms are cut for a large and the chest measurements are laughable.,21330,1
21330,The actual size of the XXL is a M/L fit and the chest cant be any larger than a 38 or 40 B.,21330,1
21330,The thinness of the material is really the only acurate thing about this dress when it comes to a discription.,21330,1
21330,"If you as a company cant accurately cut for a size larger than an american M/L, please stop selling this merchandise like you can.",21330,1
21331,This necklace was poor quality and I ended up giving it away.,21331,1
21331,I guess you get what you pay for.,21331,1
21331,Skip this one folks.,21331,1
21332,"Pictured shirt shows metal studs on the Owl, which  greatly enhances the appearance of the shirt.",21332,1
21332,The shirt you will receive dose not have any studs.,21332,1
21332,"The size runs very small, even using the provided size chart.",21332,1
21332,"Photo shows a Size Large Blue T-shirt, with the Persun size XL shirt on top of it.",21332,1
21332,"Persun shirt fits like a small, would order two or three sizes up.",21332,1
21333,I was very disappointed it said large and fit like an extra small.,21333,1
21333,I had to give it to my 14 year old daughter.,21333,1
21334,Looks extremely cheap,21334,1
21335,I got what I paid for.,21335,1
21335,Does not look like the picture.,21335,1
21335,The gold paint coloring is off.,21335,1
21335,the earrings are two different colors.,21335,1
21335,"There were coins missing from the necklace, coins on the necklace I received barely had any coins on it.",21335,1
21335,Does not look like the pic.,21335,1
21335,Would not buy this again.,21335,1
21336,Sizing was wrong and not as long as shown.,21336,1
21336,It will fit if you look like the model.,21336,1
21337,Like the item sizes aren't true to fit,21337,1
21338,Too small and arms way too narrow for XL size.,21338,1
21339,It broke after I wore it for 3 days.,21339,1
21339,cheaply made product..,21339,1
21340,not as pictured,21340,1
21341,Ordered a xl for me who does a med./lg.,21341,1
21341,Because reviews say it ran small!,21341,1
21341,It is extremely small !,21341,1
21342,Worst bathing suit that I've ever ordered.,21342,1
21342,"The top piece isn't even sewn together correctly, I can't even begin to explain how messed up the top was and the bottom was way too small, if you need some motivation to workout by feeling horrible about yourself buy one of these.",21342,1
21343,This was not even close to and adult medium closer a childs medium.,21343,1
21344,The product dod not meet my expectations and I never got my refund after returning it,21344,1
21345,This clock doesn't keep time well.,21345,1
21345,I set the time and within a couple weeks it's running five minutes fast.,21345,1
21345,I reset it and it's fast again in a couple weeks.,21345,1
21346,Never again will i buy this merchandise,21346,1
21347,"Very small, bought the xxl and normally I'm a L. The V part is really high and awkward",21347,1

21350,I have it to the homeless shelter.,21350,1
21350,And felt bad about doing it.,21350,1
21350,Just junk.,21350,1
21351,Another accidental order from China.,21351,1
21351,Ridiculous!,21351,1
21352,"the torso on this dress is very short something like a childs body, waste of money",21352,1
21353,I felt the plastic was thin and the overall quality was cheaply made.,21353,1
21353,I returned this because I compared this to another one I bought back in 2013 but had to replace because my niece took it.,21353,1
21353,Tried this because it was a few bucks cheaper and the reviews were good but this just doesn't compare.,21353,1
21353,I'm buying the other one.,21353,1
21353,Would gladly pay a few bucks more for better quality.,21353,1
21353,The plastic was much thicker and more durable.,21353,1
21353,The zipper was better quality...It was a ykk zipper on my previous one.,21353,1
21353,The zipper on this one is cheap.,21353,1

21355,I was so looking forward to this dress but now seeing it not worth it.,21355,1
21356,Dress is beautuful however the top fits 2 sizes smaller than the bottom :(,21356,1
21357,The clasp for the chain broke the first time I tried to open it.,21357,1
21357,And the cross slips out of the infinity symbol.,21357,1
21358,Very poor visibility  outside in the sun,21358,1
21359,Material is not of good quality and the picture/images are very misleading ..,21359,1
21359,The dress does not have the neat look as it shows in the image.,21359,1
21360,This looked so bad...,21360,1
21360,I am in good shape 5'6 130 pounds slender and the bottoms made it look like i have sausage rolls busting out and one of the straps wasn't even sewn on..  and the top fit but it fit very strange..,21360,1
21361,"I offered a small which is my normal size, and it did not fit like the picture whatsoever, much smaller!",21361,1

21366,"Low quality, not that great.",21366,1
21366,Looks good in the picture but looks very chip once you put it on.,21366,1
21367,they came and look like chiwawa dogs.,21367,1
21367,they do not look at all like a cat.,21367,1
21367,my daughter was upset she wanted it to look like the picture.,21367,1
21367,and most the trouble is trying to send them back.,21367,1
21367,they only want to pay back half of what i paid.,21367,1
21367,and i ordered 2 of these.,21367,1
21368,ugly omg don't by this anymore,21368,1

21375,"The size is very off, the top is much smaller than the bottom, but also the band for around the top was very large.",21375,1

21376,"It's bright red, almost pink looking.",21376,1
21376,It stains terribly - which is expected for a cheap price - but there are better fake bloods out there.,21376,1
21376,It also smells pretty bad.,21376,1

21384,They were at least two sizes smaller then expected.,21384,1
21385,I was hoping for a device that would attach buttons back onto my pants and shirts.,21385,1
21385,This one did not.,21385,1
21385,"Upon pulling the trigger, the metal pin extrudes out to the side at a wide angle.",21385,1
21385,"The plastic button fastener(s) fell to the ground multiple times, never securing the button.",21385,1

21409,the print is horrible.,21409,1
21409,You can definitely tell its a cheap knock off and really disappointed with the price vs quality.,21409,1
21410,This thing is ridiculously cheap.,21410,1
21410,I wouldn't have spent more than $2 on it if I'd seen it in person.,21410,1
21411,"Shirt was a strange material, and looks like the colors were printed on the fabric instead of dyed.",21411,1
21411,It had little green spots in the colors.,21411,1
21411,"Not really upset, it was a cheap shirt.",21411,1

21418,Crappy product.,21418,1
21419,"It fit's as expected but beware if you want to return it, it will cost you half the price",21419,1
21420,It was see thru,21420,1
21421,Did not fit even after dropping 27 pds and I followed fitting chart,21421,1
21422,Total waste of money!,21422,1
21422,I put it on my phone correctly and it did fit right but it broke when I put my case back on my phone.,21422,1
21422,So I ordered another one thinking it was my fault it broke plus I really want the protection for my phone so I also ordered a wallet fold over type of cause so there would be no chance of the case breaking it again and the very next day after putting it on the second one I bought had cracked as well for no reason at all.,21422,1
21422,The phone was not dropped or anything else that could have possibly made it break plus it even had a soft phone case cover on it so it really should have not broke but it still did so this is not a good made product at all and will break very very easilly with in 24 hours so you will not get the protection for your screen that your looking for because it will not last longer than a day to even protect your phone screen and I even tried it twice not just once.,21422,1
21423,This is a wrong item I buy other blouse,21423,1
21424,"If I could give this item no stars, I would.",21424,1

21425,Zero stars are too many for this product.,21425,1
21425,I've never been this disappointed with anything before.,21425,1
21425,The robe was wadded up and put into a plain plastic bag.,21425,1
21425,It was opened and the whole thing looked like it had been washed many times.,21425,1
21425,The fabric was coarse and thin.,21425,1
21425,I would never consider using this thing with a baby.,21425,1
21425,Maybe it would be good to check the oil on my car.,21425,1
21426,Terrible.,21426,1
21426,Looks like a leotard,21426,1
21427,Terrible quality,21427,1
21428,"This is not a woman's garment, it is sized for a child and that's no exaggeration.",21428,1
21428,When I opened the package I thought it was a large square scarf.,21428,1
21428,Do not order from this company unless you are a size zero then order XL.,21428,1
21428,The product description should come with a disclaimer about sizing.,21428,1
21428,I would have given no stars.,21428,1
21429,Entirely too small,21429,1
21430,I ordered this a size up due to the reviews and it was still too short in the midsection.,21430,1
21430,"I'm very skinny and around 5'4"" and a medium did not fit me.",21430,1
21430,Plus a little button on the side was broken when it came.,21430,1
21430,Will not be ordering this again,21430,1
21431,too small in this shoulders.,21431,1
21431,who did they make this for a midget?,21431,1
21431,pissed me off.,21431,1
21432,Cheap junk.,21432,1
21432,Don't buy,21432,1
21433,THIS OUTFIT SHIRT DID NOT MATCH THE PANTS IN COLOR ONE WAS LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE WAS DISAPPOINTED,21433,1
21434,Ugly hate them!,21434,1
21435,They broke just as soon as you put them on and they were actually big to begin with.,21435,1
21435,Will not recommend these to anyone.,21435,1
21436,"looks really cheap when it arrived, not as pretty as shown in picture",21436,1

21438,middle stone fell out second day,21438,1
21439,Large was too tight!,21439,1
21439,And I normally wear a medium.,21439,1
21439,Ugh waste of money,21439,1
21440,Strap broke after three months and zipper snagged on the lining all the time.,21440,1
21441,"This dress looks NOTHING like the picture, it's an extremely cheap dress and not anywhere near that length.",21441,1
21441,"I am 5' 3"" didn't ven reach my ankles",21441,1
21442,very small,21442,1
21443,It's printed nicely and wide enough - but it's a crop top.,21443,1
21443,As if they cut half of it off.,21443,1
21443,Wider than it is long.,21443,1
21443,The photo and model are completely deceptive in the proportions.,21443,1
21443,Or - perhaps her hips directly connected to her armpits.,21443,1
21443,What a disappointment because the fabric and print are nice.,21443,1
21444,Update: Sadly the zipper on the green skirt broke and would cost too much to repair.,21444,1
21444,I have this in three colors.,21444,1
21444,You can dress it up or down and you'll always look great.,21444,1
21444,Thick fabric that lays well and doesn't wrinkle.,21444,1
21445,"Not a good description, it shows a dress cover up/tunic on pic.",21445,1
21445,But I order 2 large and I swear it probably fits a thin perdon as a blouse.,21445,1
21446,Don't know which body types these guys base their sizes on but ordered an XL and it fits like an Small,21446,1
21447,Despite the sizing chart there is no way that this can fit a normal person.,21447,1
21447,It was way too tight and rather itchy.,21447,1
21447,I would not spend my money on this product.,21447,1
21448,I'm a 36D.,21448,1
21448,Normally an XL fits fine.,21448,1
21448,Ordered up to XXL after reading all the reviews.,21448,1
21448,It fit like a S or maybe a M. Gave it to my 100 lb friend.,21448,1
21449,Looks to cheap.,21449,1
21450,The ribbon was ripped up the collar looks like it was cheaply sown I would've gave half of one star if I can,21450,1
21451,Size medium would fit a 5 year old.,21451,1
21452,Color rose is not like the picture.,21452,1
21452,"It's darker and a more dull rose, not vibrant.",21452,1
21453,"Not mid calf - is knee high, ugly  and the colors are not as presented in the description and image.",21453,1
21453,All dark gray.,21453,1
21454,Don't waste your money,21454,1
21455,"Don't like , fits to small.",21455,1
21455,.,21455,1
21456,Item had to be returned because it was too small.,21456,1
21457,Basically a shirt,21457,1
21458,I only had this for a day and I lost both the ring and the ball that same day..,21458,1
21459,It took forever to deliver and the fit it way small,21459,1
21460,Disappointed.,21460,1
21460,The belt shown is not the belt I received.,21460,1
21461,This hat is adorable but the quality is AWFUL!,21461,1
21461,The pom on the top was hot glued on and there are visible globs of glue around it.,21461,1
21461,The inside isn't sewn completely and there are loose threads everywhere.,21461,1
21461,"I would return it, but it's really not worth the cost.",21461,1
21461,DO NOT BUY!,21461,1
21462,Was very disappointed.,21462,1
21462,The dolphin design was paper.,21462,1
21462,Would never hold up in our weather.,21462,1
21462,They were quick to refund my money.,21462,1
21463,"I just opened the package and right on top of the folded skirt, you can see threading that's coming out!!",21463,1
21463,I will not even be trying this on.,21463,1
21463,"Also, the white looks like a nice, creamy white, but the outfit is like a pair of whitey tighties.",21463,1
21463,"If you want to take a chance, don't take it on the white.",21463,1
21463,You'll be disappointed.,21463,1
21464,The Pom poms fell off the boots within 2 days of wearing them.,21464,1
21464,Would like a replacement,21464,1
21465,Nothing like the description or picture.,21465,1
21465,A knock of cheaply made tshirt cardigan.,21465,1
21465,Not even close to the same colors!,21465,1
21466,It was way too small.,21466,1
21466,It was more of an ill fitting shirt.,21466,1
21467,"Although the garment fit, it is nothing like I expected and I will be returning.",21467,1
21467,The material is too thin and the workmanship is shoddy.,21467,1
21467,My elderly father has been ill or I would have already returned.,21467,1
21468,"I never even got a pendant on my necklace, this is what I received in the mail instead.",21468,1
21469,Too tight for that size,21469,1
21470,I just received this shirt after waiting too long to get it.,21470,1
21470,It came from China for some reason even though it said it was a DC Conics shirt.,21470,1
21470,This was definitely not a DC short and was falsely advertised.,21470,1
21470,I'm so PO'ed because I will not have enough time to get a 'real' green lantern shirt for the party I'm throwing.,21470,1
21470,"Not only was the color completely off, but the shirt was to large and curves out a bit as if it were destined for a girl.",21470,1
21470,This was an absolute waste of money.,21470,1
21470,You'll see the lime green shirt that represents the product I received and a picture of a size 3t shirt on top of the product to demonstrate how off it was in sizing.,21470,1
21471,I wish that this bag was more like the photo.,21471,1
21471,"Unfortunately, the material was very thin and flimsy, and there was a pungent chemical smell coming from it.",21471,1
21471,I was hoping that by leaving it in the sun for a day or two would allow the chemicals time to air out.,21471,1
21471,"When that didn't work, I tried washing it, with the same result.",21471,1
21471,This was  originally going to be a gift for a child.,21471,1
21471,"Needless to say, I did not feel it safe in giving it to her.",21471,1
21471,"I contacted the vendor for a return label, but they were unable to send one.",21471,1
21471,"Instead they allowed me to keep purse, which I promptly threw in the recycle bin, and reimbursed me a portion of what I paid.",21471,1
21471,"They seemed very understanding, which I appreciated.",21471,1
21472,I guess for the price I can't complain but it looks cheap!,21472,1
21473,It was too small it's a horrible jacket don't waste your money,21473,1
21474,For the price and rave reviews I expected these to be the answer.,21474,1
21474,They are nice looking and supposed to be great for foot problems.,21474,1
21474,"However, on wearing them for just a short trip to the store I already was getting sores on my feet.",21474,1
21474,The material they are made from is hard and cut right into my feet.,21474,1
21474,If I would take much of a walk with them I'd be bleeding.,21474,1
21474,"Sorry, had to send them back for a refund.",21474,1
21475,"Color is dull, ""large"" is actually a small .",21475,1
21475,It's for sure going to be returned!!,21475,1
21475,"Description says ...sexy bikini ..obviously,  it's a full one piece swimsuit.",21475,1
21476,this is not what I received.,21476,1
21476,I received a silver moon on a black cheap string.,21476,1
21476,I have purchased this item before and this is not what I bought.,21476,1
21477,Not what I expected,21477,1
21478,Your dress is awful,21478,1
21479,this was worse than any moomoo i have ever put myself into!,21479,1
21479,horrible!,21479,1
21479,i am 5'2 and about 110lbs.,21479,1
21479,boo,21479,1
21480,I thought I got the wrong dress.,21480,1
21480,The picture is deceiving and the dress is awful.,21480,1
21480,The fabric and the details of the dress is not the same as in the picture.,21480,1
21480,"Sorry, but this is a waste of money.",21480,1
21481,"Horrible fit, fabric looks like a Halloween costume",21481,1
21482,I have only had the bag for 1 week and already the buckle is broken.,21482,1
21482,"The screws that are holding the locking mechanism and the small, leather pull tab on the front top flap of the bag have failed completely.",21482,1
21482,Now I am afraid to put anything more than my computer and a folder in the bag for fear of the other screw coming aloose in mid stride while walking down the street.,21482,1
21482,Disappointed because I love the look and feel of the bad.,21482,1
21482,For the 3 days that the bag stayed together I got many compliments on it.,21482,1
21482,"A real shame, I had high hopes.",21482,1
21483,I ordered a large so it would be a bit big.,21483,1
21483,I couldn't get into it.,21483,1
21483,Poor quality.,21483,1
21483,I would not recommend.,21483,1
21484,"Very disappointed, ordered red and it looked pink and my child put it on snapped the buttons and they came undone and fell off.",21484,1
21485,Ummmm... NO!,21485,1
21485,"First of all, the pic is misleading.. they had to use a little kids hand to display it.",21485,1
21485,"I have pretty thin wrists and if you wear the watch on top of your wrist as shown, which is the norm, the bracelet goes off to the side.",21485,1
21485,"No matter how you adjust the added linkage of chain, it is off to the side and not as displayed in the pic.",21485,1
21485,"Also the cute little locket, on mine, is on the other end of the bracelet part, not up towards the top by the watch.. so unless i take a pair of pliers and move it, my little locket is completely underneath the wrist.",21485,1
21485,In the bathroom light this sparkles and is very pretty.,21485,1
21485,"Of course we all know we get what we pay for, but be forewarned this is really cheap metal.",21485,1
21485,You can tell it by looking at it.,21485,1
21485,The cheap chain links are probably just cheap plastic (not metal) and the gold part you can look at and see it's cheap.. like out of a bubble gum machine...  the gold will probably turn color within 6 months.,21485,1
21485,"Considering the price, that all would be ok.. if it lasts 6 months..",21485,1
21485,I just got it and was trying it on and there was a knock on the door of a delivery guy with a package..,21485,1
21485,I went to take the package from him and the watch/bracelet fell off immediately..,21485,1
21485,The only clasp to close it is a magnet and it is clearly not strong enough to hold it together even for the simplest tasks and motions you may do with your hands.,21485,1
21486,Watch after 1 week back light not working!,21486,1
21486,Not sadisfied at all!,21486,1
21487,These earrings looks exactly as I expected and I really liked them at first.,21487,1
21487,"However, the earrings don't just irritate my ears, they actually caused swelling and bleeding.",21487,1
21487,"No issue with my ear cartilage piercings, but my ear lobe piercings (which I've had since I was twelve and never had any problems with) are extremely painful now.",21487,1
21487,"I suspect it's the black coating that's doing this, they're going straight into the trash.",21487,1
21488,"It's a nice coat, however, the coat is designed for a petite person.",21488,1
21488,My wife typically is a size 6-8 and even the size x-large was too small.,21488,1
21489,Made for a child,21489,1
21490,Not the same material.,21490,1
21490,Way to big.,21490,1
21490,Not even the same color.,21490,1
21491,Very loose!,21491,1
21492,Not at all like the picture,21492,1
21493,My grey ear muffs were delivered today and they were torn up.,21493,1
21493,"I really don't have time to process a return/refund so I'll try sewing the open space..

Other than that, they work well and prevent your ears from freezing",21493,1
21494,Very disappointed.,21494,1
21494,It's hideous.,21494,1
21494,Material has barely any stretch.,21494,1
21494,Just looks bulky and unattractive.,21494,1
21494,The belt is cheaply made and ugly.,21494,1
21495,Small,21495,1
21496,I got a medium and the top area is okay but the waist is skin tight and I don't like how it feels I won't be wearing it,21496,1
21497,"I need to return them way to much money, they are very narrow.",21497,1
21497,Very cheaply made.,21497,1
21497,0 stars,21497,1
21498,This outfit was too loose where is shouldn't of been abs too tight where it should've of been.,21498,1
21498,My son is on the small side and it fit him so poorly!,21498,1
21498,The buttons also kept coming undone.,21498,1
21498,So bad that at points it looked like my son was wearing a dress.,21498,1
21498,I encourage no one to buy this poorly measured poor quality outfit!,21498,1
21499,It was smaller than a 3X,21499,1
21500,The lens are darker then the picture,21500,1
21501,"Absolutely not a ""slim fit""!",21501,1
21501,Fits like a typical Large shirt.,21501,1
21501,Not happy AT ALL.,21501,1
21502,"it is the same model number as the pair I own, but the material is thinner and the waist size is smaller.",21502,1
21502,"They should be identical,",21502,1
21503,They are much larger than I thought they would be; almost the same size as my earlobe.,21503,1
21504,Do not.,21504,1
21504,I repeat.,21504,1
21504,DO NOT ORDER THESE.,21504,1
21504,The stitching is like someone on crack went crazy with a sewing machine.,21504,1
21504,They do not fit at all at all at all.,21504,1
21504,It's not like they are just too small.,21504,1
21504,No no.,21504,1
21504,They are stitched like a maniac and do not even remotely fit on a human body.,21504,1
21504,DONT DO IT.,21504,1
21505,"I love the style of this blouse, unfortunately, it is way too small.",21505,1
21505,"Taking the previous reviews into account, I purchased this item 3 sizes larger than I would normally wear and it was still TOO SMALL!",21505,1
21505,"It is EXTREMELY frustrating, disappointing and surprising to order items from Amazon and receive this kind of poor quality.",21505,1
21505,I now have to go through the hassle of sending this blouse back to Amazon.,21505,1
21505,"Going forward, it is imperative Amazon request their manufactures use the North American sizing chart.",21505,1
21505,This will immediately elevate any further concerns with sizing.,21505,1
21505,"On a positive note, the color of this blouse is vibrant and clear, and it is sewn very well.",21505,1
21505,"Separate from the sizing, this is a good product, the company just needs to be willing to put in the effort to use a North American sizing chart.",21505,1
21506,What?,21506,1
21506,Has Amazon lost it?,21506,1
21506,"I cannot wear a coin/key purse on my feet for even one second, width is too narrow and there is no arch support.",21506,1

21508,Way too big and just awkward.,21508,1

21508,The material is really cheap.,21508,1
21508,"Even though the price is low, it's not worth it.",21508,1
21509,"Not authentic Tory Burch, yet Tory Burch prices!",21509,1
21510,Can't put Yuri p a rating.,21510,1
21510,It was to small to fit.,21510,1
21510,Size chart was no help,21510,1
21511,This is a good belt... until it breaks apart... not worth the money since it cracks at the holes.,21511,1
21512,"Do not buy, very poor quality:  the hems unraveled on the first washing!",21512,1
21513,this product is way to small.,21513,1

21519,this particular shoe immediately started fraying.,21519,1
21519,"I wore them at a water park, taking them out of the packaging at the park and putting them on.",21519,1
21519,All around the edges got 'fuzzy' from the fiber coming lose.,21519,1
21519,I will be sending this pair back.,21519,1
21519,I ordered 2 other pairs/styles from this same company and they worked great for my husband and daughter at the water park.,21519,1
21519,No 'fuzzy' issues.,21519,1
21520,It fell apart on me.,21520,1
21520,"There was tons of extra strands hanging off, meant to use a lighter to burn off the unfinished strands, but parts of the shirt fell apart and unstranded on me after about the 4th time i wore it.",21520,1
21520,Shoulders and buttons too,21520,1

21523,It's not a dress lenght is more like a shirt I'm 5'6.,21523,1
21523,Waste of money.,21523,1

21524,Sleeves are too short.,21524,1

21525,Only problem is the visor part of the cap is about 1 inch longer than other caps and looks ridiculous.,21525,1
21526,The shoe itself is just like the picture but it smells as if it was used not pleasant.,21526,1
21526,Its a very cheap material.,21526,1

21527,I like the style though.,21527,1
21528,Not a good product.,21528,1
21528,I tried it one and the fit was good - when i put it on for a skit at work the zipper was broken - meaning non- existent!,21528,1
21528,Very disappointing!,21528,1
21529,I did not like this product at all.,21529,1

21549,However my husband has had it less than a year and it's falling apart.,21549,1
21549,The leather is frayed and is also detaching  from the clasp.,21549,1
21549,I emailed the company and they won't stand behind the product.,21549,1
21549,I would never purchase another product from this company.,21549,1
21550,"Very thin fabric and way, way smaller than normal sizing.",21550,1
21550,I even ordered a size up just to be safe!,21550,1
21551,I was very disappointed in the quality of the boning.,21551,1
21551,It was extremely light and flexible not at all how steel bones should be.,21551,1
21551,The material is almost a denim.,21551,1
21551,The only positive about this corset is the length should cover my hips ( the size was to small for me to put on.),21551,1
21551,Don't waist your money on this garbage piece.,21551,1
21551,Go for playgirl corsets much better quality.,21551,1
21552,Way way too small and the chest band hurts,21552,1
21553,"I know I was buying something cheap, but very disappointed in the quality of this.",21553,1
21553,I can only use the garter belt as the string bikini and bra don't fit,21553,1
21554,"I normally wear a medium in tops, but I wanted this to fit really loose, and knowing how these sizes run, I ordered an extra large.",21554,1
21554,I now own a crop top.,21554,1
21554,It comes just past the chest on me.,21554,1
21554,The arms fit perfectly.,21554,1
21554,Really bummed out about this top!,21554,1
21554,It's otherwise really cute!,21554,1
21554,I'm sure it will look cute on my 7 year old niece!,21554,1
21555,I don't like  them they are fake,21555,1
21556,Poor product.,21556,1
21556,Good for one time use.,21556,1
21556,Wont fit after first wash. Don't buy it.,21556,1
21557,Ordered a large and it would fit my 10 yr old daughter,21557,1
21558,gave it to my sister,21558,1
21559,Couldn't fit.,21559,1
21559,Looks like a small not large,21559,1
21560,I got a 38 and my roommate who is a 32 could not fit into the pants.,21560,1
21560,If the size was actually correct they would have been great.,21560,1
21561,"These dress runs too too  small, I wear a small or Medium and this dress was a large , I could not even put it on..",21561,1
21562,The appearance of the wallet was fine.,21562,1
21562,The problem I had was that the zipper would catch on the cloth on the inside and would not open once I zipped it shut.,21562,1
21563,Were not 3+.,21563,1
21563,Returned.,21563,1
21564,Terrible,21564,1
21565,Ordered a size up and it was still too small.,21565,1
21565,Also very cheap material and kind of see through.,21565,1
21565,Not flattering at all.,21565,1
21566,I loved how the sweater was portrayed in the ad.,21566,1
21566,Unfortunately I purchased it for an upcoming holiday and did not try it on before I left.,21566,1
21566,It was two sizes too large.,21566,1
21566,"BUT worse than the sizing, the sweater is just poorly made!.",21566,1
21566,"The waist band is supposed to have an elastic border to, give the garment some SHAPE.",21566,1
21566,"However, although I followed washing instructions exactly according to the directions, it is badly misshapen and quite frankly, a complete and total piece of junk.",21566,1
21566,"Too late to return the piece of ""let's pretend sweater""to Amazon.. What a shame.",21566,1
21566,What a complete and utter waste of money.,21566,1
21566,I don't care if it was fairly inexpensive.,21566,1
21566,I can't wear it.,21566,1
21566,Is a contribution to a homeless shelter the only answer?,21566,1
21566,NO!,21566,1
21566,I'd rather go out and buy a decent cardigan for a woman who could use a helping hand.,21566,1
21567,Did not like the fit of the dress.,21567,1
21567,We went off the measurement guide but it did not seem to fit as expected.,21567,1
21567,"Lace and neck very tight and itchy while waist fits baggy, very heavy dress dress and uncomfortable.",21567,1
21568,Trying to return product.,21568,1
21568,Very small.,21568,1
21569,The dress is pretty but not as shown in the picture the bust area is too big and very tight in mid section cheap material,21569,1
21570,Inferior product ; too small to fit my laptop,21570,1
21571,you get what you pay for..,21571,1
21572,Huge studs and cheaply made.,21572,1
21572,"More in line with costume jewelry, i suspect.",21572,1
21572,"Definitely not what I was looking for, especially for this price.",21572,1
21572,Going to have to return.,21572,1
21573,bad bad these clothes,21573,1
21574,The pattern is completely different and it was too short for a dress but it ok as a shirt,21574,1
21575,"This is a medium or large at best, not a 2XL.",21575,1
21576,Size nothing close to x large cant even wear it,21576,1
21577,"This could've fit for a small child, & I ordered A large",21577,1
21578,"When I first got these, I was very exciting.",21578,1
21578,I think they're cool and fit well.,21578,1
21578,"UNFORTUNATELY, the metal connector at the hinge broke (split in two pieces, not just unscrewed) after wearing it just FIVE times, on literally the 32nd day of owning them!",21578,1
21578,(i.e.,21578,1
21578,right after amazon's return window).,21578,1
21578,Very disappointing.,21578,1
21578,"Furthermore, I contacted the seller and they didn't even have the decency of responding to my message.",21578,1
21578,"Almost all sellers have the decency of responding, even if they say ""sorry, we cannot replace the item"".",21578,1
21578,"It's really a shame, cuz I was ready to leave a great review, and then the sunglasses broke hurrendously 2 days after the warranty window was up.",21578,1
21578,sad.,21578,1
21578,:( perhaps the seller will see this review and think differently in the future.,21578,1
21579,Please note if your are NOT her size don't buy waste of money,21579,1
21580,these socks were a disappointment!,21580,1
21580,They run small & when you have them on you can't even tell that they are Grinch socks.,21580,1
21580,The eyes don't line up properly!,21580,1
21580,They are over-priced for the quality.,21580,1
21580,"Normally, elite socks are true to size but with these, that is not the case.",21580,1
21580,Do not recommend wasting your money on these!!!,21580,1
21580,!,21580,1

21582,"Horrible, waste of money",21582,1
21583,Returned,21583,1
21584,It's way to small,21584,1
21585,I would give this shirt a zero if possible.,21585,1
21585,"The material is terrible, not at all soft or comfortable... the sizes are completely wrong, it fits way too small and is sized strangely.",21585,1
21585,A complete waste of money.,21585,1
21585,Do not buy it!,21585,1
21586,Ordered an Extra Large and it was the equivalent of a small....,21586,1
21587,The material is too cheap,21587,1
21588,This is way smaller than the size says in the ad.,21588,1
21588,Also the bling started falling off as soon as it was in wrapped,21588,1
21589,"DON'T PURCHASE, HORRIBLE!!!",21589,1
21589,Looks like a jr high kid made it in home economics.,21589,1
21589,I bet it took longer to put the ad up for it than to make it.,21589,1
21590,do not buy!!,21590,1
21590,This product is huge and there`s no size chart.,21590,1
21590,I ordered a large and is stated is was a size 16/18 absolutely huge more like a size 20.,21590,1
21590,Then I have to pay to return the product $7.50.,21590,1
21590,OUTRAGEOUS....,21590,1
21590,I ordered a medium too it is even large but I can layer that ......,21590,1
21591,This is a nice idea but not for curvy women.,21591,1
21591,I am gonna keep it but will have to lose a few inches of my bottom.,21591,1
21591,It fits me like a tee shirt.,21591,1
21591,It should come in various sizes it is definitely not one size fit all,21591,1
21592,Run crazy small.,21592,1
21593,"arrived earlier than expected, but the first time I put it on, the button snapped.",21593,1
21593,the material is incredibly thin and looks like it's going to tear apart soon.,21593,1
21594,Extremely small and thin...I bought this for a photography prop...it was a waste of money.,21594,1
21594,Not to mention the fabric has a strong chemical odor,21594,1
21595,Horrible,21595,1
21596,Very cheap material.,21596,1
21596,Waste of money.,21596,1
21596,I got a size larger just in case and they fit but are scratchy on my skin and look super cheap,21596,1
21597,Came damaged,21597,1
21598,Too small,21598,1
21599,"I could not even put my arm through the sleeve, very tight, I think it's a child's coat size, I tried several times to return it and no one responded back to me, price is great maybe I will give it to a cold very small child",21599,1
21600,From the beginning I got an infection from wearing this piece.,21600,1
21600,Then it broke when I bent over.,21600,1
21600,"Very dissatisfied, cheap quality.",21600,1
21601,"FOR A CHILD...I am only 5'3, and this only comes to my waist (and I am not big chested or anything).",21601,1
21601,"I opened the package and started laughing, as this literally, size wise, looks like something you would buy for a 3 year old.",21601,1
21601,I mean it is tiny.,21601,1
21601,"The fit that is on the model, for that to be accurate she would have to be about 70 lbs, and 4'5.",21601,1
21602,"Do not buy this skirt, it's nothing like the picture shows.",21602,1
21602,It's not even a fold over waist skirt.,21602,1
21602,Complete garbage!!!,21602,1
21602,!,21602,1
21603,First time on Amazon that I felt i have gotten ripped off.,21603,1
21603,"These glasses were described as having a glass lens, metal frames, and high quality.",21603,1
21603,WHAT A JOKE!!,21603,1
21603,"Plastic lenses, and the optics are horrible.",21603,1
21603,Everything looks dingy and slightly blurred.,21603,1
21603,What a huge disappointment.,21603,1
21603,"They are super light weight and remind me of the type of sunglasses you would buy at a gas station, overpriced and cheaply made.",21603,1
21603,"These however, are worse.",21603,1
21603,"The one positive is that they came fairly quick from China, a little more than a week!",21603,1
21603,"I was looking for some bargains on sunglasses with glass lenses and ran across these and took a chance.... sometimes it pays off, but this time it didn't.",21603,1
21603,Heed my advice and look elsewhere and don't buy these things at ANY price.,21603,1
21603,I paid fifteen.,21603,1
21604,I was so exited to buy this dress!,21604,1
21604,"It fits very well though, I am 5'4 and 168 pounds 38 D and ordered an xl.",21604,1
21604,"The problem, which ultimtely made it un-wearable for me is the straps are way to far in.",21604,1
21604,"My breasts were spilling over and you can see a large portion of my bra, if the straps were an inch or two over it might have worked.",21604,1
21605,"Poor fit, I am petite and the small was too wide and to busty.",21605,1
21605,Very ill-fitting and unflattering and cheaply made,21605,1
21606,Disappointing fit & the seam was unraveling around the neck collar.,21606,1
21607,"This ""dress"" is more like a shirt.",21607,1
21607,"I knew it was shorter, however would not be acceptable to wear without pants.",21607,1
21608,"Truthfully I didn't expect much, but these earrings are a piece of junk.",21608,1
21608,"The hinge is wobbly, the clasp doesn't work and the very first time I tried to put them on they broke.",21608,1
21608,And they don't look half as nice as in the picture.,21608,1
21608,I didn't return them because the shipment would cost me almost as much as the earrings and therefore this would be a waste of my time.,21608,1
21609,"Very short, very small.",21609,1
21609,DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT.,21609,1
21609,Advertised as plus size and the pic shows it reaching to the top of model's thigh.,21609,1
21609,It would barely cover the waistband of my Levi's if I could wear it.,21609,1
21609,Ordered 2 sizes larger and it is 5 sizes too small.,21609,1
21609,Also it took almost two months to arrive.,21609,1
21609,Disappointed.,21609,1
21610,Within three weeks the toe seams came completely apart.,21610,1
21610,Cheap terrible shoes.,21610,1
21610,A toddler is going to wear them!,21610,1
21610,Please put some effort into the materials and construction!,21610,1
21611,Very see through.,21611,1
21611,Prepare for undergarments that hide everything.,21611,1
21612,Way too expensive to have this happen.....,21612,1
21612,"The black accents, I can't tell what it's made of, spread black stuff all over the shorts and won't come out.",21612,1
21612,They super cute otherwise.,21612,1
21612,Going to write the company and see what happens.,21612,1
21613,This costume is trash.,21613,1
21613,I ordered it twice thinking the first time may have been a fluke.,21613,1
21613,"The skirt material comes all stuck together, almost like it's melted.",21613,1
21613,When you pull it apart the color is ruined where it was stuck together.,21613,1
21613,Spend the extra money and get a good quality costume.,21613,1
21614,It's large for my size!,21614,1
21614,Doesn't look like size small.,21614,1
21615,"The bag itself was very nice - however, it had been treated with some sort of toxic smelling chemical that smelled so terribly that I could not keep it nor the box it was shipped in, in my home.",21615,1
21615,The best way to describe the toxic smell is a combination between diesel fuel and creosote.,21615,1
21615,"I tried to allow the bag to ""air out"", but it was so bad that the smell transferred to anything that it touched.",21615,1
21615,I was 100% disappointed in this purchase and DO NOT recommend this to anyone who cares about their health.,21615,1
21616,Color was ugly.,21616,1
21616,Not what it looked like in picture,21616,1
21617,Way too small and cheap looking.,21617,1
21617,It's not real silver only plated.,21617,1
21617,Would never buy anything from them again.,21617,1
21618,Definitely meant for a shorter girl.,21618,1
21619,Looks better in the picture.,21619,1
21619,Very bad quality.,21619,1
21619,I'm upset with my purchase.,21619,1
21620,wire was coming out of the cup.,21620,1
21620,Bottoms okay,21620,1
21621,I only received 3 of the 10 that I paid for.,21621,1
21622,"I'm very unhappy, it's terrible quality",21622,1
21623,THE PRINT IS NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS THE PICTURE.,21623,1
21623,TOTALLY DIFFERENT PICTURE TO FOLLOW!!,21623,1
21623,!,21623,1
21624,"Too small, it is not for an adult to wear.",21624,1
21625,"First off, I could not, for the life of me, get these to go into my ears because of the curved bars.",21625,1
21625,"I fought for about 30 minutes to get both in, which is not an issue I have with other earrings.",21625,1
21625,Once I got them in they broke my ears out very badly.,21625,1
21625,"They swelled up, pussed up, and got super red and itchy almost immediately and lasted for weeks afterward.",21625,1
21625,"My ears are sensitive, but this was worse than others.",21625,1
21625,Much worse.,21625,1
21625,"Beyond that, they were cute and very solid and heavy earrings, but I won't touch them ever again.",21625,1
21626,One end piece was stripped when I received them.,21626,1
21626,Wouldn't screw onto the post at all.,21626,1
21626,They look cool but not good quality I guess.,21626,1
21627,i got liquid latex instead :\ idk was it supposed to be?,21627,1
21627,i was expecting fake blood,21627,1
21628,No a flattering dress for petite person.,21628,1
21629,This dress looks like a table cloth.,21629,1
21629,I threw it aside.,21629,1
21630,It was junk.,21630,1
21630,None of these held up for more than a week,21630,1
21631,"Product size was ordered based off of THEIR size chart, and I took proper measurements before ordering, and item fit big.",21631,1
21631,Item also had multiple sewing flaws within the beading and in the hem of dress.,21631,1
21631,Seller refunded money but not without multiple condescending emails.,21631,1
21632,"Although I ordered an XL, the top was the size of a youth large or an adult XS.",21632,1
21632,It was poorly made.,21632,1
21632,I wa not at all pleased.,21632,1
21633,Large fits more like 2x,21633,1
21634,"BUYER BEWARE, this looks nothing like the photo, it's made of a cheap material that almost like a table cloth.",21634,1
21634,"I ended up giving mine away, was so not worth the money.",21634,1
21635,"Not as pictured, because it shows a solid black chiffon and actually the skirt is sheer with only a half slip showing from inside.",21635,1
21635,Never worn because of this.,21635,1
21636,You get what you pay for.,21636,1
21636,The waist came up to my underarms practically.,21636,1
21636,I was going to return them but return shipping was more than the pants cost.,21636,1
21637,The fit is wonderful ... love the stretch in the fabric ...,21637,1
21637,It's really really cute ...,21637,1
21637,"The PROBLEM: The fabric has a terrible odor that even after numerous launderings,  the pungent smell still has not dissipated ...",21637,1
21637,I DO NOT recommend,21637,1
21638,This isn't at all like the picture.,21638,1
21638,I am very skinny and I couldn't even zip the skirt up I don't know who this is suppose to be made for but maybe it would fit a little girl.,21638,1
21638,the waist is impossible for any adult in my opinion.,21638,1
21638,Again I am very skinny and if it doesn't fit me I can only imagine the next size down from me is a kid.,21638,1
21638,"The color is ALOT more of a pale pink, and the skirt is see-through.",21638,1
21638,You definitely cant wear this without a slip underneath.,21638,1
21638,I am sad because i love the skirt in the picture.,21638,1
21638,But it is nothing like the picture.,21638,1
21639,"I say too small, because the top shrunk two sizes when washed and dried.",21639,1
21639,The bottoms didn't.,21639,1
21640,Bad quality.,21640,1
21640,It looks like a pijama.,21640,1
21640,I REALLY DO NOT LIKE,21640,1
21641,Size listed was extremely deceptive,21641,1
21642,"I ordered this 2 sizes larger that I normally wear, It is basically a shirt that would fit a 12 year old.",21642,1
21643,This product is not true to size and his poor quality,21643,1
21644,I saved them for my kid to start school the lights Stopped working after a week very disappointed the seller won't let me return them my kid wore them 5 times,21644,1
21645,These earrings made my ears get so infected I had to leave them out and let my holes close.,21645,1
21646,They are very heavy.,21646,1
21646,Didn't expect them to be,21646,1
21647,Much too small and is practically sheer..very cheap product!,21647,1
21647,Poorly made.,21647,1
21648,I ordered it extra large so I would have plenty of wiggle room!,21648,1
21648,Not the case runs very small!,21648,1
21649,I'm rating this a one star.,21649,1
21649,"I know it says it is made of stainless steel, but I had an allergic reaction to it from the second I put it on.",21649,1
21649,I've been trying to get rid of the hives on my hand and wrist for two days from it.,21649,1
21649,"I'm not sure what the problem is, but I've never had a problem with stainless steel.",21649,1
21649,"That being said, I have the rose gold and it is much prettier in person than in the photo on Amazon.",21649,1
21649,It is sturdy.,21649,1
21649,The links feel sturdy but the clasp feels cheap.,21649,1
21649,I suppose this is a case where you get what you pay for.,21649,1
21649,"If I hadn't had the allergic reaction to it, I would definitely keep it and wear it as it is a cost effective alternative.",21649,1
21649,It did not pinch my skin or pull my arm hairs.,21649,1
21650,The wallet is being returned be cause it had mold all over it.,21650,1
21651,My socks were ripped!,21651,1
21652,I was skeptical in ordering this because of the low price and no reviews to be read.,21652,1
21652,"It came quickly and in a very pretty pouch in three individual bags; one for the stone, one for the chain and one for the holder.",21652,1
21652,"I assembled it and added the oil to the stone, placed it inside the holder and clasp it best that I could.",21652,1
21652,I went to put it on and the stone fell out.,21652,1
21652,I put it in again and made certain that it caught best possible.,21652,1
21652,I wore it for about 2 minutes and it opened up and the stone fell out again.,21652,1
21652,The clasp will not stay closed for the stone to safely stay.,21652,1
21652,I am going to try to squeeze it with tweezers and see how that works.,21652,1
21652,"It is a very bright silver as it is silver plated, not real so be prepared for that if you order it.",21652,1
21653,Nice looking watch.,21653,1
21653,quite beefy.,21653,1
21653,"Problem is, they failed to include the instructions!",21653,1
21653,Some of the buttons don't seem to work either.,21653,1
21653,"Tried to strap it on my wrist, and the buckle fell off in my hand!",21653,1
21653,"From now on, I buy American, or use the sun to tell time.",21653,1
21654,I ordered a 4x going by reviews and size chart.,21654,1
21654,I am normally an XL in outfits.,21654,1
21654,I am a double D breast cup size.,21654,1
21654,It fit way to small on my breast it seemed like they made it for a B cup.,21654,1
21654,So unsatisfied.,21654,1
21654,It was only around 13 bucks so I kept it and wore it anyway but will never buy from this manufaturer again.,21654,1
21655,it came way too small and with no button holes.,21655,1
21655,Total piece of crap.,21655,1
21655,Will never their crap again.,21655,1
21656,Absolutely garbage.,21656,1
21656,Refund taken immediately.,21656,1
21656,"Strings everywhere, was coming apart, about 10 sizes to small.",21656,1
21656,Very very very bad.,21656,1
21657,"I BOUGHT THIS SHIRT FOR MY MOM FOR MOTHERS DAY..IT STATES ON THE WEBSITE ..""RUNS SMALL"" SO I WENT BY THE CHART PROVIDED AND I WENT UP 3 SIZES ACCORDING TO THE CHART AND THE SHIRT IS STILL TO SMALL.",21657,1
21657,BY THE SIZING OF THE CHART THE 2X SHOULD OF BEEN PERFECT WITH SOME EXTRA ROOM SO IT WOULD BE COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.,21657,1
21657,UNFORTUNATALLY ITS VERY TIGHT AROUND THE BUST AND WAIST AREA.,21657,1
21657,"ITS AN ADORABLE SHIRT AND THE SAYING IS WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE SHIRT...SO..I DECIDED TO FRAME THE SHIRT FOR MY MOM SO SHE CAN SEE IT HANGING ON HER WALL AND KNOW SHE IS ""MOMTASTIC"" TO ME...AS WELL AS FANTASTIC!!!",21657,1
21657,THE SHIRT IS MORE THE SIZING FOR A YOUNG TEENAGER...,21657,1
21658,The dress looked NOTHING like the photo and was not made well.,21658,1
21658,The lace design was nothing like the photos.,21658,1
21658,It was also pure white and not cream.,21658,1
21658,DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS.,21658,1
21659,Runs way too small!,21659,1
21659,I wear a 10 and ordered a Large...have to give it to my daughter in law who is tiny.,21659,1
21659,Very disappointed but not worth the expense or bother of returning.,21659,1
21659,"If you buy from Asia vendor you're sizing according to their standards, not USA size standards.",21659,1
21660,Terribly small.,21660,1
21660,I'd say order 4 or 5 sizes up.,21660,1
21660,Bought it for my daughter who is about a 3x.,21660,1
21660,I'm a large to xlarge.,21660,1
21660,It fit me.,21660,1

21663,!,21663,1
21664,This dress stinks looks nothing like this I had you send it back!,21664,1
21665,I ordered a 3X and it was at best a large.,21665,1
21665,The size chart indicated a 3X was size 54 to 56 chest.,21665,1
21665,I have a 52 inch chest and this coat would not even reach the outside of my pecks.,21665,1
21665,Horrible size chart.,21665,1
21666,It is shorter in the waist than average XL sweatshirts.,21666,1
21667,CHEAP,21667,1
21668,To small said they was the right size but not,21668,1
21669,Cheaply made.,21669,1

21671,I was so excited to get this purse.,21671,1
21671,Bought it as a birthday present for myself.,21671,1
21671,Talk about disappointing.,21671,1
21671,"The bag is soooo much smaller than pictured, the chain ""straps"" can barely fit over your wrist let alone a shoulder.",21671,1
21671,"The strap is very cheap vinyl, and the kicker...I noticed such an odd smell when I opened the package.",21671,1
21671,Kinda musty like a basement.,21671,1
21671,The actual purse smelled way worse.,21671,1
21671,Then I find a rose scented sachet in my new purse.,21671,1
21671,Huh?,21671,1
21671,"Where was this kept that you need to artificially ""scent"" it?",21671,1
21671,This honestly seems like the listed purses shoddy counterfeit Chinese counterpart.,21671,1
21671,Do not waste your time.,21671,1
21672,Cute in theory - but horrible in real life.,21672,1
21672,It is see through...,21672,1
21672,So you've been warned.,21672,1
21672,I was thinking I could just use it as a swim cover up - but the strap broke.,21672,1
21672,Ugh.,21672,1
21672,"Plus - this must be made in China, because it is cut small.",21672,1
21672,"On a positive note, it's a pretty pattern.",21672,1
21673,fell apart BEFORE my next trip.,21673,1
21673,s***ty crap!,21673,1
21674,These shoes were entirely to large,21674,1
21675,"The dress material is like cheap Halloween costume material, and it was very see through.",21675,1
21675,"Also, I ordered and XL (I'm usually L/XL), but it was way too small, seemed more like a medium.",21675,1
21676,I won't purchase the 12 pairs generic socks from China again.,21676,1
21676,The socks develop holes after wearing twice.,21676,1
21676,They are also made of very thin almost see through material.,21676,1
21676,They pass for women's socks.,21676,1
21676,These socks also run small.,21676,1
21677,Junk.,21677,1
21677,Cheap knock off-hand-made garbage from China.,21677,1

21678,I would have loved this romper if came in the size I ordered.,21678,1
21678,"I am 5'7, 175, and accordingly I ordered an XL.",21678,1
21678,"This romper was in a plastic ziplock bag labeled XL, however, the fabric tag showed it was medium.",21678,1
21678,"The other XL Persun romper I ordered was even smaller, however, it looked like the fabric sizing tag was removed with a seam splitter.",21678,1
21678,"The previous ratings seemed to be a little scattered as far as how the sizing fitted, and it seems like they just send you whatever size they have in stock",21678,1
21679,Sawing default.,21679,1
21680,Came with two holes in it.,21680,1
21680,One right up front and one in the back.,21680,1
21680,"Material is super thin, almost see through.",21680,1
21681,Fabric tore just trying to unbutton to try on!,21681,1

21684,It's not properly together please send my money back,21684,1
21685,"CHEAP FEELING fabric, no compression and too small.",21685,1

21687,These were extremely small!,21687,1
21687,Terrible sizing!,21687,1
21687,I would give minus stars if I could.,21687,1
21687,I could not even begin to get them on.,21687,1
21688,"The pockets are sewn together, so no pockets.",21688,1
21688,The jacket smelled of plastic and had to get it cleaned too.,21688,1
21688,Size runs too small.,21688,1
21689,"It did not stick, thankfully I brought a back-up with me so I could change.",21689,1
21690,"BRIGHT PINK, don't forget to put on your sunglasses for this shirt.",21690,1

21691,Rough material.,21691,1
21692,Nothing like the picture !,21692,1
21693,"Bought this item for my nieces bec they find it cute, however the latch will not open at all.",21693,1
21693,"Matter of fact, one broke just from trying to open the latch.",21693,1

21694,The material is cheap and the color of the sweater is beige not gray.,21694,1
21694,Do not buy it.,21694,1
21695,Threw it out!,21695,1
21695,Not only was it smaller than expected but every hook had metal sticking out of it.,21695,1
21695,Material was not soft and itched the skin it touched.,21695,1
21695,"Nope, not good......",21695,1
21695,Learned a very valuable lesson....,21695,1
21696,Cheap quality.,21696,1
21697,Super small,21697,1
21698,Loved the look but the pads for the bust area are way off...they are weirdly flat and about 3 or 4  inches below where they should be.,21698,1
21698,Not sure what I can do to fix this as I wore it and cannot return it.,21698,1
21698,Maybe cut them out?,21698,1
21698,Oh well..lesson learned...Do not wear hoping it will magically be ok!,21698,1
21699,DONT BUY THESE LEGGINGS.,21699,1

21701,"I read previous reviews about how this top ran a bit small, so I ordered one two sizes larger than I normally would, based off of the sizing chart that was provided.",21701,1
21701,It was still too small.,21701,1
21701,It was too small by an obscene margin.,21701,1
21701,"At first I thought they had sent me the wrong size, it was that small.",21701,1
21701,I could not get it on over my shoulders.,21701,1
21701,"The fabric is nice, the embroidery seems well done, and it comes with an attached slip so it's not see through.",21701,1
21701,But this is clearly intended for the size 0-4 crowd.,21701,1
21702,"returning,  to narrow for my daughters hands.",21702,1
21703,Cheaply made.,21703,1
21703,Held to the ring by a flimsy piece of metal that breaks off the first time you put your key in your pocket,21703,1
21704,Bought 9 pairs of these for my beach volleyball team.,21704,1
21704,6 broke within the same day.,21704,1
21704,Very cheap plastic.,21704,1
21704,Lenses are decent but frames are garbage.,21704,1
21705,Terribly made.,21705,1
21705,Awful shirt.,21705,1

21707,But a bigger top because the top was cheap and didn't fit around my boobs.,21707,1
21708,this dress was cute but wasn't made right had a major defect,21708,1
21709,I really really dislike this new style toms.,21709,1

21710,It just falls out of the case.,21710,1
21710,Very dissapointed.,21710,1
21711,They are made of cheap material and ripped in the knee before I pulled them up,21711,1
21712,"Im keeping them for Pajama pants but there is NOTHING baggy about these, they are like tight leggings when I say nothing I mean NOTHING most of the wide leg pants I require a medium I feel like you have to be a child to wear these.",21712,1
21712,I am 5 ft 4 inches so the height was JUST RIGHT but THATS IT id stay away from these,21712,1
21713,Knew from when I tried on dress the zipper was touchy.,21713,1
21713,"However, zipper broke right before the wedding and I had to be sewed into the dress by the bridesmaids.",21713,1
21713,A quality zipper would not have cost the company that much and then I would not have had to deal with this on my daughter's wedding day.,21713,1
21713,I would not recommend this company to anyone!,21713,1
21714,Size not accurate!,21714,1
21715,This bracelet is so pretty.,21715,1
21715,I ordered it a month before Christmas and did not receive it until after Christmas.,21715,1
21715,"The reason I gave it one star is because it does not stay latched, the charms will not stay in a pretty position, they get under the bands and get tangled up.",21715,1
21715,Very disappointing.,21715,1
21716,0 stars for this product.,21716,1

21717,"For the price, I was very disappointed.",21717,1
21717,Not sure why a pajama Jean would not have a high rise fit.,21717,1

21722,.,21722,1
21722,.,21722,1
21722,"however, this is the old-fashioned, thick, iron-on decal type, not the screened artwork that you get these days .",21722,1
21722,.,21722,1
21722,.,21722,1
21722,which means it is a b**** to launder.,21722,1
21722,"Cannot put in dryer because it could melt, need to be very careful ironing for the same reason.",21722,1
21722,"Also, design is crooked on the tee but, quite frankly, I do not have the energy to return and re-order.",21722,1
21722,"Disappointed, but I'll get over it.",21722,1
21723,MUCH larger than expected.,21723,1
21723,The magnetic closure isn't very strong.,21723,1

21727,It is too small with the medium size,21727,1
21728,Very  malleable.,21728,1
21728,I put the earring backs on and the whole earring just bent downward with little to no pressure.,21728,1
21729,Too small and too expensive.,21729,1
21729,I bought for my daughter on Christmas but it did not fit on her even the size is for 8-10 years old and she was 7 at that time.,21729,1
21729,It is too expensive for a swim suit $80.,21729,1
21729,It is not worth it at all.,21729,1
21729,I regretted that I bought it.,21729,1
21730,Fake,21730,1
21731,super small.,21731,1
21731,"The buttons are very tight, if you try unbuttoning them, you'll either have to dig your nails between the clasp or risk ripping the suit!",21731,1

21731,returned it right away,21731,1

21732,!,21732,1
21733,"The top part of the swimsuit was okay and it was the right bust size, but the whole bottom half was way to tight and small...",21733,1
21734,Do not like it.,21734,1
21734,Looks more like a women's  purse.,21734,1
21735,Horrible.,21735,1
21735,Not only was it broken but whoever made it didn't finish making it because there were tons of peaces completely missing from it.,21735,1
21735,They weren't even loose in the packaging just missing so I would not recommend buying this item for anything,21735,1
21736,i ordered a pair of large and was really disappointed when i recieved them.,21736,1
21736,they look like they would fit a 5 year old.,21736,1
21736,they are super small.,21736,1
21736,i already own a few pair of large ethika breifs so i know how big they should be.,21736,1
21736,not sure if they're fake or what.,21736,1
21736,never ordering again.,21736,1
21737,"The 3x was so big and long
I thought the 2x would be right

21738,Ridiculous sizing not even close to reality.,21738,1
21738,"I'm 5'4"" 140lbs.",21738,1
21738,I got a large reading that it runs small.,21738,1
21738,It's almost funny how ridiculously small it is - if it wasn't such a waste of time and money.,21738,1
21739,I don't like it.... ripped off of bottom part,21739,1
21740,Tiny and flimsy,21740,1
21741,I loved them at first but may not be the best option if you have a big booty.,21741,1
21741,They turn sheer in the butt area.,21741,1
21741,I noticed it the third time I wore them.,21741,1
21741,"This is when it would have been nice for a stranger to kindly let me know, ""Hey, ummm I can see right through the back end.""",21741,1
21742,Too small for my neice,21742,1

21744,arrived crushed,21744,1
21745,My case doesn't work anymore.,21745,1
21745,It doesn't light up.,21745,1
21746,Not very happy that this is a knitted thin cardigan instead of the crochet looking sweater as it seemed in the first 2 pictures.,21746,1
21746,Wish I'd read the reviews and looked at the last few pictures of what this item really looks like before I purchased.,21746,1
21746,It is soft though and fits in my true size.,21746,1
21747,"This s*** is totally false, the tag below says M size and the print size inside the sweater says Small.",21747,1
21747,"stamping feels different, sucks purchase.",21747,1
21748,Ordered the charcoal and it is purple!,21748,1
21748,Definitely clashes with the rest of our colors!,21748,1
21749,These shoes run REALLY narrow!,21749,1
21749,"So while the length was just OK for size 13 boy, they squeezed at the widest part of his foot (between arch and toes).",21749,1
21749,"This has never been an issue with other shoes and he fits in his other size 13 shoes with no issues, so this seems to be a direct problem with this shoe.",21749,1
21749,"I compared them bottom to bottom with his other regular size 13 shoes and they are at least 1/4"" more narrow and even more so at the toe.",21749,1
