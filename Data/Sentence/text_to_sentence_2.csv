22028,It only fits 2 inches above the knee.,22028,2
22028,It can't go any higher.,22028,2
22028,I also figured this would be really effortless to wear but instead it's bulky enough (without stuff inside it) and my thighs do touch enough that I can feel it rubbing my other thigh when I walk.,22028,2
22028,In any dress that doesn't have a flared skirt you can see it right through the fabric very obviously.,22028,2
22028,The black lace is pretty but I thought the pockets would all be within the beige fabric behind it.,22028,2

22028,In my experience wearing it for 20 minutes before I left the house it sagged and didn't seem to hold up on any place on my thigh.,22028,2

22033,The material is somewhat of a stretchy jean.the dress didn't look nothing like the picture,22033,2
22034,Gloves look fantastic.,22034,2
22034,"However, these are listed as size ""Adult"" and say 14+ on the package.",22034,2
22034,They don't actually fit an adult.,22034,2
22034,"They fit my 8 year old ""perfectly"".",22034,2
22035,I would have easily give 5 stars for this sweater because it looks so cute and exactly what I was looking for to wear with my brown leggings and brown boots.,22035,2

22038,I had to fix my shorts before I could wear them.,22038,2
22039,"Took over a week to ship, when I finally received it the size was more like a kids size instead of an adult medium",22039,2
22040,I returned it.,22040,2
22040,Bottom fit very full and made me look much larger than I am.,22040,2
22040,"I liked the corset-like top, but isn't sturdy enough to stand up on it's own.",22040,2
22040,Red velvet had bad creases after a few minutes of wear.,22040,2
22041,These are not nylon they are thick black socks.,22041,2

22044,"Hides tummy well, easy to put on.",22044,2
22044,But I do not like the way my butt looks in it.,22044,2

22044,I do have a big bottom so maybe that's it,22044,2
22045,"too small, some scratches on the leather",22045,2
22046,Size was not what I hoping for.,22046,2
22047,I love the style of this jacket but the size's run's very small.,22047,2
22048,NICE BUT TOO SMALL,22048,2
22049,Very thin and does not drape the way it looks in the picture,22049,2
22050,Pretty dress however I did not care for the top for the reason being it wasn't cut very neatly.,22050,2
22051,Brim is good but can't tighten it enough with string in back.,22051,2
22051,Material for tightening doesn't hold in place.,22051,2
22051,We are considering returning it.,22051,2
22052,"You can't beat the price but if you are buying this for a watch you are going to wear every day, you may want to reconsider.",22052,2
22052,"It itches, and after about a week and a half I had a rash underneath the band.",22052,2
22053,not as i  thought it would fit,22053,2
22054,Is quite a bit bigger than I expected and short as well.,22054,2

22055,Kinda bummed because I really liked them.,22055,2
22056,Reviews are right.. way too small and I don't know how I could even wear this all day.,22056,2

22056,Will be returning this item,22056,2
22057,Did not fit as expected,22057,2
22058,did not fit right,22058,2
22059,Definitely not what I expected for the price!!,22059,2
22059,I would say this is a $4.95 item at the most!,22059,2
22059,"I must have paid for the ""free"" shipping on this item and it was poorly packaged just in a plastic mailing bag...",22059,2
22059,Very disappointed.,22059,2
22060,"to large in the boob area, the straps where placed in the wrong position for this to work properly.",22060,2
22060,and the lace over the boob section is already coming unstitched and i have not even wore it yet.,22060,2
22060,If these things were corrected it would be a great top.,22060,2
22061,"Because the fit was too small (and I ordered a size larger than my normal), the shirt would curl/ride up when I moved in it.",22061,2
22062,"Runs small, not as cute in person",22062,2
22063,Fits exactly as I would expect any normal shirt to fit.,22063,2

22064,"I bought it to wear in hot weather, but the material is not breathable at all.",22064,2
22064,The shape is also not as pictured - mine poofed out right under the belt line and went straight down like a brick.,22064,2
22064,Same diameter at the hips as at the knees looks very square.,22064,2
22064,"The pattern was pretty, but I returned it.",22064,2
22064,"Thankfully, no issues with return.",22064,2
22065,Part of the belt fell off the second time I wore it.,22065,2
22065,Feels very cheap.,22065,2
22065,The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it held my pants up.,22065,2
22066,hard to move arms without exposing myself,22066,2
22067,"After reading the size chart and carefully choosing what was meant to be a size twelve to fourteen I ordered this what I received was about half that size, in fact if was tight on my sister who is a size six.",22067,2
22067,With the annoyance of returning things I chose just to give it to her.,22067,2
22068,"I purchased ""this hat"" almost exactly 1 year ago.",22068,2
22068,That was a 5 star purchase...,22068,2
22068,I loved it but after many washes and my toddler getting his hands (and teeth) on the velcro it stopped holding well so I decided to buy another.,22068,2
22068,I noticed the price had gone up by a few dollars but figured it was a great hat so I'd go ahead and get a new one anyway.,22068,2
22068,"I used the ""Buy it again"" button, verified that it was the same hat as before and clicked purchase.",22068,2
22068,Quite disappointed with the had that showed up.,22068,2
22068,"It is smaller in both brim and fit, the ventilation holes are no longer metal but wrapped in thread.",22068,2
22068,"I expected to get the same hat when clicking ""buy it again""

I would not have paid the higher price if I had known I was getting a worse hat.",22068,2
22068,I'll keep it as a backup or something but will probably be stitching new velcro onto my other one since it actually fits and feels better.,22068,2
22069,Didn't like the way it looked too small,22069,2
22070,If you are a size LARGE and UP...just a warning.,22070,2
22070,The back of the material is white...and the more it stretches...the lighter they get.,22070,2
22070,Looked HORRID on me.,22070,2
22070,"If you are Medium or smaller, very cute.",22070,2

22074,The zipper broke the first time I used it.,22074,2

22074,It was a little small for what I had in mind.,22074,2
22074,"It's not quite big enough for an overnight bag, but is similar in size to a diaper bag.",22074,2
22074,The refund was quick and painless.,22074,2
22075,Large is more like a small!,22075,2
22076,The material was very thin and size runs very small.,22076,2
22076,"I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant, 155 lbs, 5'3"" and size 10 was way too small.",22076,2
22076,I would probably fit in size 14.,22076,2
22077,Somehow it wasn't what I expected.,22077,2
22077,It's really bright and loud.,22077,2
22077,I thought the gold would be soft.,22077,2
22078,Way too big.,22078,2
22079,cheap materials.. you can only wear once or twice .. then it becomes put-me-in-trash condition... don't buy it!,22079,2
22080,I'm a small person skirt is to big zipper giving problems  I'm not pleased it Cost more to return than to buy,22080,2

22081,Not right at all.,22081,2
22081,Not even very warm.,22081,2
22081,Pretty half-assed attempt.,22081,2
22082,"As a collegiate powerlifter I work out quite often and lift weights, so I have some muscle on my arms.",22082,2
22082,This shirt fits great over my torso but the arms are quite small.,22082,2
22082,This makes wearing the shirt uncomfortable and look awkward because the sleeves can only slide up so far.,22082,2
22082,I would recommend this to someone who is slender and does not have muscular or larger than average arms.,22082,2
22083,too small,22083,2
22084,It's cute but huge,22084,2

22086,"I like to soak my jewelry in peroxide while I take a shower, so I don't feel like they are getting a good clean with one ball fixed.",22086,2
22086,"The ears are also too heavy, causing the bunnies to flop dow and stick out.",22086,2
22086,"Also, be careful not to tighten too far because the screw threads will eventually become uneven and the bunnies will not lay the same.",22086,2
22087,"My suit fit perfectly, but arrived with a hole in the center of it  The material is very thin.",22087,2
22088,"It is short, it is small than expected and was not at all what I had hoped.",22088,2
22088,I will probable donate this dress to a second hand shop.,22088,2
22089,"While the shoulder and hip width were the correct size, the length was WAASYYYY to short.",22089,2
22089,"I am petite and have a short body, but this was ridiculous.",22089,2
22089,I had the mega wedgie from hell!,22089,2
22089,Do not buy from this seller.,22089,2
22089,"I bought two others from other sellers, and they fit fine all around.",22089,2

22096,Was not as sheer as it looked in the pic.,22096,2
22096,Way too much sequin for me...looked like something for someone older...like in their 50's.,22096,2
22096,Definitely not something to wear with a material that pulls easily...it will mess it up.,22096,2
22097,"These were cute because they were DISNEY.....however, material is flimsy and not top quality, for sure.",22097,2
22097,"Stitching was irregular, collar trim was sloppy, no attention to detail.",22097,2

22110,"Without instructions, it was difficult.",22110,2
22110,One has to be very dexterous in order to accomplish the task.,22110,2
22110,"After I changed the battery, I discovered that the minute and second hand were stuck together, and when I tried to gently separate them, all the hands fell off.",22110,2
22110,Bummer.,22110,2
22111,cheap.,22111,2
22112,The material was irritating and the dress was too short.,22112,2
22112,It fit on the upper  part but the bottom wasn't flattering.,22112,2
22112,Not what I was expecting.,22112,2
22113,These run very small.,22113,2
22113,Ignore the size chart order a size or 2 larger for USA women....if I knew it  was  coming from China I would have  ordered a larger size.,22113,2
22113,I just  requested a refund ..I'll see what happens,22113,2
22114,The dress does not look like the photo,22114,2
22115,Did not fit well at all and the material was very uncomfortable.,22115,2
22116,Terrible material quality.,22116,2
22116,The fit is awkward.,22116,2
22116,Would not buy again.,22116,2
22117,"I'm 5'8"" size 12
One size: did not fit me.",22117,2
22117,Too short and too tight,22117,2
22118,Cute dress.,22118,2
22118,And I knew by the price it would not be the best quality- and also by the reviews that it would run small .,22118,2
22118,I ordered a large and it barely fit as a size 6.,22118,2
22118,I reordered an XL.,22118,2
22118,It came with an XL tag but fit exactly the same as the large.,22118,2
22118,Just a hassle.,22118,2
22118,How do I get my money back from China?,22118,2
22118,?,22118,2
22119,"Thick and inconvenient...looks like it is not as was advertised, shipped another item..",22119,2
22120,"Ok, so...this swimsuit is cute.",22120,2
22120,That's about it.,22120,2
22120,"The top seems to be of good quality but, the Mermaid shorts/tail are very cheaply made.",22120,2
22120,My daughter wore this for a week and part of the shorts have turned all black.,22120,2
22120,Not pleased.,22120,2
22121,"Low quality, cute gift for a child though at this price point.",22121,2
22122,it does not keep the squirrels out of my garden.,22122,2
22122,i have tried on all settings.,22122,2
22123,Quality was flimsy.,22123,2
22123,I returned the product.,22123,2
22124,"Bought the ""green pebble"" one thinking it would be a nice evergreen color like in one of the highlighted reviews...Nope I opened it and saw this muted brown-green color that looks ugly.",22124,2
22124,Great interior though with the card slots.,22124,2
22125,Clamp too tight.,22125,2
22125,Hard to free money from the clip.,22125,2
22125,"Disappointed,especially for the cost",22125,2
22126,"Not american sizing, and even when ordered larger did not fit",22126,2
22127,Way too small and if you wear any pant over size 6 you will look ridiculous.,22127,2
22128,"too long to deliver, poor quality run small.",22128,2
22129,Ordered a large and it was the size of a small shirt.,22129,2
22130,poorly done,22130,2
22131,"It came on time and as described , HOWEVER it broke in 2 weeks .",22131,2
22131,The straps slowly started to brake one by one until the straps came off completely.,22131,2
22131,"the zipper doesn't work well , itll only zip some of it and both zippers popped off .",22131,2
22131,the outside pockets on the side (black) made bigger holes if you put any pens/pencils in it,22131,2
22132,It runs very small.,22132,2
22132,It is also very short.,22132,2
22132,I bought this item twice and it still didn't fit.,22132,2
22132,The material is very nice and it is a pretty dress.,22132,2
22132,Wishes they ran in much bigger sizes.,22132,2
22133,Good design however way to small evenif an xxl is ordered,22133,2
22134,cute...but small :(,22134,2
22135,"Way too small, and the fabric is much thinner than I was expecting.",22135,2
22136,Design ruined by their cheesy logo stuck in an awkward spot.,22136,2
22137,"They hurt my feet, i had to return them.",22137,2
22138,Received 4 red mittens instead of the 6 color variety as promised and outlined in listing.,22138,2
22138,Seller originally was communicating with me on getting me the missing mittens but has since gone radio silent.,22138,2
22138,I would not recommend this item if you are expecting 6 different colors.,22138,2
22139,"Although the size and measurements were what I needed, It was much smaller than I expected...sleeves were very snug, and could barely pull i over my chest.",22139,2
22139,I guess the cut was a bit off.,22139,2
22139,"I will use it for a gift as it is too small for me and the XL is only slightly bigger, so it will be snug as well.",22139,2
22139,Disappointed.,22139,2
22139,"will not order from this merchant unless I drop 30  pounds, which is unlikely",22139,2
22140,"Way too small, it's cute though,  I wish it fit.",22140,2
22141,I bought a couple of these two of them broke as soon as we put them on,22141,2
22142,These were 18g and they were about 12mm wide.,22142,2
22142,They were too big on my nose and I down sized to 20g.,22142,2
22143,I was excited to receive my socks then I noticed the socks weren't the same color as they are in the picture.,22143,2
22143,They are a light green instead on a darkish green.,22143,2
22143,The light green ends up making the socks look very weird.,22143,2
22144,Product seems we're very messed up - sending back!,22144,2
22145,Sleeves are too small.,22145,2
22145,"The cut is described as slim it, it should read more like shrink wrap.",22145,2
22145,When considering this product note: order two to three sizes up from what you would normally wear.,22145,2
22145,The cufflink buttons are also very cheap and are hard to unbutton.,22145,2
22146,I usually love PattiBoutik but this dress was a bit of a bummer.,22146,2
22146,It was really tight and the fabric was scratchy (think wool socks).,22146,2
22146,The dress is also really short (it covered my butt with only a few inches to spare).,22146,2
22146,I usually wear a medium in their shirts but the medium dress was really snug and uncomfortable in the arms.,22146,2
22147,It's pretty but i got it for myself and its small like it would fit a Child.,22147,2
22147,i put it on and it was like a choker on me if you like that kind of look,22147,2
22148,"I ordered this because I needed a white purse to match my shoes but it is more of a tan color, Not white!",22148,2
22148,I ordered a different one and I hope this one will be white!,22148,2
22149,Cute but sized way too small.,22149,2
22149,"Bought a 7, fits like a 5.",22149,2
22150,I was very disappointed in this dress.,22150,2
22150,Going to make it into a dust rag.,22150,2
22150,It works better as that than a dress.,22150,2
22151,The sizing chart is way off.,22151,2
22151,This shirt was so small it wouldn't even fit over my head.,22151,2
22151,Can't return it because it comes from China and took over a month to receive it and is to expense to ship back.,22151,2
22151,Lesson learned to never order anything from over seas.,22151,2
22151,Where is all the American made things?,22151,2
22152,"I bought these to wear on a daily basis, but after a week I had to take them out.",22152,2
22152,Recently they rubbed off and then turned my ears green.,22152,2
22152,"Nice to wear for a couple of hours, not so nice if you want them as a regular wear.",22152,2
22153,These would have been the perfect color for a costume I need if they fit.,22153,2
22153,They are a good length but you would have to be a twig to squeeze into these leggings.,22153,2
22154,"It fits the description, but they are ugly..super thick and a weird material.",22154,2
22154,They will sit in my closet til I can give them away.rough itchy material,22154,2
22155,Bad quality,22155,2
22156,Make sure you wash alone inside out...I washed it once and now it is unwearable due to fading...she had worn it once!!!!!,22156,2
22156,totally stinks!!!,22156,2
22156,!,22156,2
22157,Was too big in bust area and too short.,22157,2
22157,"I am 5'6"" and the waist band part didn't lay where it should and if I pulled it up to there it was a little to short.",22157,2
22157,It is silky soft just not proportionate.,22157,2
22158,Arrived quickly.,22158,2
22158,"The lace was nice and stretchy, and it really could face been cute, but the collar didn't even wrap the whole way around the neck, and the button to hold it together didn't really do its job...",22158,2
22158,"There were loops of thread sticking out, as well.",22158,2
22158,"I suppose these things can be fixed by a tailor, or yourself if you know anything about sewing, and if so, go for it!",22158,2
22158,"But otherwise, I don't recommend it.",22158,2
22158,":(

Don't mind my bad skin and bad shots in the photos.. No help to get better pictures.",22158,2
22159,"They were beautiful, perfect weight, just right purple color but way too small.",22159,2
22159,"I was very disappointed in the fit, so I returned them.",22159,2
22159,I ordered 2 other pairs feim 2 other vendors and their size charts were spot on.,22159,2
22159,This vendor should revisit its size chart.,22159,2
22160,"Color & style are nice, but not the material I expected.",22160,2
22160,Kind of cheap looking,22160,2
22161,Cheap material broke when I was trying to put it on,22161,2
22162,looked to Mexican,22162,2
22163,I ordered a medium- fit more like a large.,22163,2
22163,Material...ehh...it's ok.,22163,2
22163,I think I'll like the outfit more once I get it taken in so that it fits properly.,22163,2
22164,It was much smaller than expected.,22164,2
22164,Print and fabric very nice.,22164,2
22164,I ordered XL but it fits my daughter who is a medium.,22164,2
22165,Size runs smaller than it should,22165,2
22166,too small and I did not like the material,22166,2
22167,I don't like.the material  and  it was too long,22167,2
22168,It looks like a Halloween costume because of the thin & stretchy material.,22168,2
22168,I've had it for a few months and still haven't wore it.,22168,2
22169,Very tight and uncomfortable and quality lacking .. very thin material,22169,2
22170,The sizing of the shirt is wrong this shirt is to short,22170,2
22171,FIRST AND FOREMOST THE SHIRT IS NOT BLACK!!,22171,2
22171,I received a navy blue plaid shirt which instantly threw me off.,22171,2
22171,I have purchased this to wear over a number of black outfits for a upcoming trip and sadly now I can't because it doesn't match.,22171,2
22171,"As for the fit I am 5'0, 160 pounds.",22171,2
22171,Length wise it was perfect and it fit on the arms but it was just a step away from being too tight.,22171,2
22171,It does say one size fits all but I would advise anyone with larger arms/wears bigger than a medium in tops not to buy it.,22171,2
22171,Plus it isn't the right color.,22171,2
22171,-___-,22171,2
22172,"Two small in the crotch, also ripped in the crotch.",22172,2
22173,The product does look like the picture and the price was great.,22173,2
22173,I just was upset to see how thin the material is.,22173,2
22173,Its not something you could wear in a pool or out for that matter.,22173,2
22173,I was so upset because after I received this swim suit I didn't have time to find another.,22173,2
22173,The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I got exactly what I paid for.,22173,2
22173,I wish I would've just spent more money to get something with a better quality.,22173,2
22174,I bought 5 of them and was very disappointed.,22174,2
22174,Very cheaply made.,22174,2
22174,"Nothing to give an adult, might be good for children, but frankly would not waste your money.",22174,2
22175,Immediately broke..,22175,2
22176,Shipping took a while because it was coming from China.,22176,2
22176,I received it and the colors were correct (I got the tan color).,22176,2
22176,I ordered XXL 35-36 waist 46 in the hips.,22176,2
22176,Everything fits except the waist was baggy.,22176,2
22176,The material is stretchy.,22176,2
22176,It feels like a thick t shirt.,22176,2
22176,But it's not fitted all the way.,22176,2
22176,What I really don't like is the pattern.,22176,2
22176,"The picture shows a more worn out ""smeared"" pattern and what the pattern on the item received makes me feel like I'm part of the Flintstones.",22176,2
22176,I had asked for a return cause it looks to costumey (I know that's not a word) and the seller had contacted me to negotiate a return.,22176,2
22176,They wanted to give me four dollars and for me to give the dress away or I can send the dress back to North Carolina (which I'm confused because it was shipped from China which makes me nervous that I'll get jipped out of my money) and I myself would have to pay for shipping it there.,22176,2
22176,"Overall, I wouldn't purchase this dress or from the seller.",22176,2
22177,Pretty lightweight material shirt.,22177,2
22177,"But omg it's small, I have bigger boobs!",22177,2
22177,so those things aren't going in this shirt.,22177,2
22177,The rest of it fits small as well.,22177,2
22177,I'm sad because I love the shirt.,22177,2
22177,Buy two or three times bigger if you have large boobs.,22177,2
22177,I bought bigger but it didn't work for me.,22177,2
22178,The material is cheap and thin and silky like and the poofer in the middle isn't poofy at all its all flat and i cant get it to poof up like the picture.,22178,2
22178,When i wore it the sleeves were too short for my arms so i would suggest going a size up from your original size,22178,2
22179,"This dress doesn't look anything like the picture, the material is very clingy,looks more like a Halloween Costume.",22179,2
22180,Looks much better on the model!,22180,2
22180,!,22180,2
22181,Looked and felt cheap.,22181,2
22182,Too small and smelled awful when it arrived.,22182,2
22182,Also shrinks in the wash.,22182,2
22183,Its not that bad,22183,2
22184,Very uncomfortable material.,22184,2
22184,Didn't like it.,22184,2
22185,As I said on first bracelet breaks too easily.,22185,2
22185,They look stungingily but our very cheaply and poorly made.,22185,2
22185,Bought way to many because of the looks and the idea of them and already have had more then 4 break.,22185,2
22186,"to small for me, gave to very little ladies",22186,2
22187,It looks much cuter in pictures.,22187,2
22187,It is a large print.,22187,2
22187,No stitching.,22187,2
22188,Had to stretch it out some...don't fit like I thought it would.,22188,2
22189,Fabric is very thin and clingy.,22189,2
22189,"Nice color, though.",22189,2
22190,My 2 year old weigh ~28 percentile and the 2T-3T are way too small for him!,22190,2
22191,The nose pad fell off after 2 days,22191,2
22192,"We purchased this for our son for Christmas, because he really liked them in shop displays.",22192,2
22192,"We got the first one just in time for Christmas, but the watch face frame was cracked.",22192,2
22192,Amazon's awesome return policy was great.,22192,2
22192,They sent a box quickly with the postage sticker and it went well.,22192,2
22192,We got a replacement just in time for Christmas.,22192,2
22192,"All was great, but the next day he took it in for the watch band to be adjusted to his size, the watch repair shop noticed a screw was missing.",22192,2
22192,"We should have sent it back, but the watch company offered to send it to their corporate office to replace the screw which is not a normal one that they stock.",22192,2
22192,"When the watch came back repaired, he got to wear it a couple days, then the same screw on the opposite side of the face frame apparently came loose and fell out while walking, so it was lost.",22192,2
22192,"We've gone to numerous e watch shops and none carry these screws, so now we have to probably send it back again.",22192,2
22192,"Very sad, because our son really loves the look of the watch and just wants to be able to wear it.",22192,2
22193,"Doesn't benefit me much, did not see or feel different better or worse",22193,2
22194,Made my shoes less slip proof.,22194,2
22195,These are very cheap quality.,22195,2
22195,Looks like some imitation of the Disney brand and I found them at half off the price I paid after I paid and received them.,22195,2
22195,After 2 wash they looked old and raggedy.,22195,2
22195,I've since thrown them out.,22195,2
22196,Thin and poor quality but I got them for the straps in back so I guess it's fine.,22196,2
22196,"The coverage in front is tricky, a small bust is fine but then it doesn't stay in place.",22196,2
22196,But a bigger bust would be hanging out so I'm not too sure how I would be on anyone else...,22196,2
22197,It came in too small and wouldn't fit correctly even though that's my size,22197,2
22198,I could never get the ball to stay in place once I stretched the ring to put it in my nose.,22198,2
22198,"The balls aren't screw on, they just sit there.",22198,2
22199,The dress pictured isn't the dress I received.,22199,2
22199,My dress looks very quickly and cheaply made.,22199,2
22199,"It came with strings hanging off of it, loose pearls, it has a black spot of the front of the dress and the back has a section where there is no bead work at all.",22199,2
22199,Not a happy customer at all.,22199,2
22199,Save your money...huge disappointment!!,22199,2
22199,!,22199,2
22200,"The look is sexy, but the pouch is *way* too small and has ZERO elasticity.",22200,2
22200,It kind of ruins the sexy look when there's a half-squished ball sticking out one side.,22200,2
22200,"Not much elasticity in the waistband or leg straps, either.",22200,2
22201,Not bad.,22201,2
22201,Fits ok and fine just to hang out in.,22201,2
22201,Dont love it.,22201,2
22202,"Bought this tshirt as a gift wife and it came with the flaw shown in the photo... she said ""I would think they would have check it before shipping or selling"".",22202,2
22202,It could have been a great gift.,22202,2
22203,This sweater is nothing like the picture.,22203,2
22203,"I am not a big person..5'4'' and 130 lbs...but it is too small in the arms, and a lot shorter than the picture.",22203,2
22203,"The color is close to what it shows, but a bit lighter.",22203,2
22203,"The knit is also a lot looser than I expected...not a good fit, poor quality and not attractive.",22203,2
22204,To start off I recieved the wrong case color.,22204,2
22204,Ive dropped it twice already and the case completely broke.,22204,2
22204,"I wouldn't highly recommend it, because the case is fragile and won't last alot of drops.",22204,2
22205,cheap fabric,22205,2
22206,Looks better in picture then in person runs small,22206,2
22207,The pants tore after the first wash.,22207,2
22208,Unfortunately these socks don't hold up.,22208,2
22208,I ended up getting holes in them after wearing 3-4 months.,22208,2
22208,For the price and expected quality I would not purchase again.,22208,2
22209,Broke within a couple of weeks and they are too heavy for a girl's ear,22209,2
22210,Much too tight!,22210,2
22211,Too big for my nose.,22211,2
22212,The sweater was way too small.,22212,2
22213,Horrible socks!,22213,2

22214,very  so so but ok to use it at home I would returned but didn't know how at the time...regret it.,22214,2
22215,"Though I ordered my size, the shirt came as ""one size fits all"".",22215,2
22215,Not true.,22215,2
22215,Its sleeves are also not as wide as they look in the picture.,22215,2
22215,Perfect for people who would fit a large or medium.,22215,2
22215,There shouldn't be size options for osfa clothes.,22215,2
22215,It is misleading to the customer!,22215,2
22216,Pants have a few holes in them.,22216,2
22216,Out of the package.,22216,2
22216,Bummed out they are cute.,22216,2

22217,3.,22217,2
22217,Design: Totally different from the picture.,22217,2
22217,The fake pockets on the picture show different sizes in thickness of the checkered parts.,22217,2
22217,"The jacket sent
  to me, both the checkered sections are the same thickness, the small size.",22217,2
22217,This makes the jacket look odd.,22217,2
22217,"The checkered section on the
  curf on the picture looks like it has a slit and folds back, but on mine both are missing, it is a continuous, non folding section
4.",22217,2
22217,"Size: The length on me (5' 3"") is up to the waist, it does not come down as shown on the picture around the hips.",22217,2
22217,"In addition, it is like a tightly
  fitted jacket not boyfriend look.",22217,2
22217,The jacket reaches my wrists only.,22217,2
22217,"This jacket has TO GO BACK IMMEDIATELY, tomorrow it has to be in the mail.",22217,2
22218,I am very disappointed that the online description or an attached label did not include care instructions.,22218,2
22218,The item arrived so wrinkled that it is hard to determine how it would look - nothing like the beautiful fit in the photo!,22218,2
22218,"I am keeping the item because I need it for a special occasion, and there is no time to exchange it, but I will not wear it much after the one time due to the fact that it requires hand washing or dry cleaning.",22218,2
22218,What a pain!,22218,2
22218,"If I had known that before I bought it, I wouldn't have - so many stylish items are available that do not require special handling and/or extra care time and expense.",22218,2
22219,Returned as it seem so bulky.,22219,2
22219,Like the other ones I ordered so much better.,22219,2
22220,The stitching was a poor on the dress.,22220,2
22221,pompoms fell off,22221,2
22222,Super small bought a double D. Fit my friend who was a large B.,22222,2
22222,So disappointed.,22222,2
22222,She has worn it a few times but said the snappy have started to stretch out...,22222,2
22223,Cheap looking.,22223,2
22223,I don't wear it,22223,2
22224,The top is too low.,22224,2
22224,I regifted it to someone else.,22224,2
22225,Smaller and tighter than I thought it would be,22225,2
22226,"Cheap material, thin, more of a short than a dress but is wider than expected.",22226,2
22226,Would not recommend.,22226,2
22227,Cute but way too small,22227,2
22228,Just ok,22228,2
22229,The ball isn't a screw on its a perfect fit.,22229,2
22229,Hard to put in.,22229,2
22230,These smelled like mold when i got them in th mail for my daughter and are see through..,22230,2
22231,"Disappointed in this purchase but now I can say that I like so many others have fallen for the runs-small, not as pictured, overseas, inexpensive waste of money garment.",22231,2
22231,Okay so maybe waste of money is strong.,22231,2
22231,Basically it runs small (got a large bc I wear a 6-10 but have a bigger chest and apparently arms and figured this stuff runs small).,22231,2
22231,"Figured a large was safe bc its a flowy, loose look.",22231,2
22231,Fitted in the arms for me.,22231,2
22231,Also very sheer and not a fabric I would have bought.,22231,2
22231,"I can't promise I will never wear it but it's definitely not going to be my go to and lets be honest, I will probably never wear it.",22231,2
22231,It also took a lot longer to come than it should.,22231,2
22231,In fairness I do believe it was in the window they quoted and maybe its bc I am used to prime but when it showed up I didn't even remember ordering it.,22231,2
22232,Thought the top was going to be longer.,22232,2
22232,Did not care for the fit,22232,2
22233,This dress is not intended for anyone who has big boobs!!!,22233,2
22233,I normally wear a dress size M (I'm a 8/10) but my bra size is 36D.,22233,2
22233,"I read the reviews of the dress running small, so I opted for a Large.",22233,2
22233,It arrived... couldn't even zipper it up.,22233,2
22233,"Returned for an XL, figuring that had to be ok!",22233,2
22233,NOPE!,22233,2
22233,Still couldn't zip it up.,22233,2
22233,I returned it and purchased an entirely different costume.,22233,2
22233,Very disappointing experience.,22233,2
22234,Fit on me ugly,22234,2
22235,"Despite being advertised as ""plus size"", they're actually SMALLER than a lot of thigh highs i've bought for the same price.",22235,2
22235,"i don't think even ""regular"" sized thighs would fit these nicely.",22235,2
22235,"I already expected low quality material because of the price, but this is just disappointing.",22235,2
22236,The umbrella got a hole after a few months of use.,22236,2
22236,Plastic is very fragile.,22236,2
22237,To small and fits awardly on the back with the opening.,22237,2
22238,these would be great if they covered my entire breast.,22238,2
22238,"but sadly they don't, if you're an B cup or smaller this will work great for you.",22238,2
22238,C cup and over Don't waste your breath lol,22238,2
22239,Had a stain when i got it and the thread was coming off overall fabric nice n soft but wouldnt pay this much for this dress again.,22239,2
22239,Was disappointed.,22239,2
22240,Runs very small....,22240,2
22241,Ask for a small and got a medium,22241,2
22242,The shirt was very tight around my arms and did not bend well.,22242,2
22242,The colors of the lace sleeves were a darker shade than the body piece.,22242,2
22242,I would have liked them the same color.,22242,2
22243,They run very small so I would suggest two sizes up,22243,2
22244,Waist is great but hip and butt don't fit well.,22244,2
22244,Lace around leg rubs and hurts.,22244,2
22244,Does not shape or sculp.,22244,2
22244,Really bummed out but I got what I paid for.,22244,2
22245,Ok but.,22245,2
22245,poor quality fabric  the first washed shrinks,22245,2
22246,They seemed nicely made but they ran small in the legs.,22246,2
22247,Very cute but runs extremely small!!!!,22247,2
22247,I got size 6T for my 5 year old twins so I even went up a size and the skirt only hangs to their knees when it should at least go to their feet.,22247,2
22247,"The top and bottoms look like they will work but only for this year, if that.",22247,2
22247,Not sure it would have even worked if I had gotten a much larger size because the bathing suit would have been too big if measuring by the length of the skirt.,22247,2
22247,Bummer!,22247,2
22248,This fits extremely tight around the bust.,22248,2
22249,All wrinkled cheap cloth sized too small,22249,2
22250,These were extremely small and better for children than adults!,22250,2
22251,The material felt ok. And the embroidery was nice.,22251,2
22251,However I am 5 foot 11 inches tall and big in the chest at a 46DDD and the dress would not make it over my girls.,22251,2
22251,So sad but it being returned.,22251,2
22252,"I have order size S for my 14 year old who normally wears neck 14'', 32' chest.",22252,2
22252,This was way too small.,22252,2
22252,"I ordered M, and it was too small (especially in the shoulders) as well.",22252,2
22252,We decided to order a different product.,22252,2
22253,Poor quality.,22253,2
22253,Looks like Chinese manufacturing.,22253,2
22254,"Was oversized, didn't fit as pictured.",22254,2
22255,The little gold leaf's fall off.,22255,2
22255,First day I put it on.,22255,2
22256,"I would definitely recommend going up a size, it was to small for me.",22256,2
22257,Zipper broke within a week,22257,2
22258,"Bought a small, was too big for my liking",22258,2
22259,"Too small, not plus size.",22259,2
22259,"Not sure if I received the wrong size/item, but I am a 2X and these did not fit.",22259,2
22259,:( Returned them.,22259,2
22260,"Ok, so first I will say I LOVE this bag, it's perfect, except that after carrying it for 2 weeks the stitching is coming out.",22260,2
22260,"I do not carry a lot of items so there is not extra weight, just very poor stitching.",22260,2
22260,Now it's just another bag in my closet.,22260,2
22260,Sad.,22260,2
22261,Material has a wool feel.,22261,2
22261,"Flat, dark black.",22261,2
22261,No sheen or threadwork visible.,22261,2
22261,"Problem was in the chest, shoulders, and sleeves.",22261,2
22261,Much too small.,22261,2
22261,A different suit by the same P&L mfr.,22261,2
22261,in the same size fit much better.,22261,2
22262,can't get wrinkles out-too big.,22262,2
22263,Not what I expected and it was way to short for me.,22263,2
22263,Sent it back.,22263,2
22264,The material is very thin and semi-transparent.,22264,2
22264,"It runs small, too.",22264,2
22264,I returned it.,22264,2
22265,super small.,22265,2
22265,you cant ask for for considering the price tho.,22265,2
22266,These are OK.,22266,2
22266,The colors are not as pictured.,22266,2
22266,They are not nearly as bright.,22266,2
22266,Many also have rough or distorted edges.,22266,2
22266,Overpriced for what they are.,22266,2
22267,"Shirt fits my 6 month old son, pants are long enough to fit his dad!",22267,2
22267,!,22267,2
22268,great color but xxl is not a true xxl,22268,2
22269,"The necklace is lovely, but for smaller necks.",22269,2
22270,not supportive enough to wear as strapless as intended but ok with the straps,22270,2
22271,just two stars didn't look anything like the picture the zipper was super small,22271,2
22272,The dress is ill fitting and does not reflect the picture.,22272,2
22272,The chest part looks weird.,22272,2
22272,I  can make it work.,22272,2
22272,I ordered a 2x.,22272,2
22272,I'm 250lbs and 5'6.,22272,2
22272,I  can make it work.,22272,2
22273,Got for grandson It was ok but looked cheap and didn't last long,22273,2
22274,"Looks pastel on screen, in person very very bright yellow.",22274,2
22275,The product is much smaller and shorter than I expected.,22275,2
22276,"Unfortunately, these are not very comfortable.",22276,2
22276,"The fit is on the small side, especially around the legs.",22276,2
22276,Will definitely not buy them again!,22276,2
22277,"The fabric is beautiful, although quite sheer.",22277,2
22277,Good for summer wear.,22277,2
22277,The cut of the garment is very unattractive on me.,22277,2
22277,It does not have a straight up and down front line for the opening.,22277,2
22277,The picture did not show that or I wouldn't have bought it.,22277,2
22277,"The other colors show a distinct straight line in the front opening, but not the blue with elephants on it.",22277,2
22277,"It has a dramatic curve from bottom to your abdominal area, accenting any bigger belly you might have.",22277,2
22277,I will not wear this.,22277,2
22277,Maybe I will give it to Goodwill or put it away for a day when I am down to about 100 lb.,22277,2
22278,Not happy.,22278,2
22278,Thought the color would be camel and it was orange.,22278,2
22279,Cheap and thin.,22279,2
22279,"They will stretch as soon as you wear them, then never to fit the same.",22279,2
22280,Beautiful but very heavy,22280,2
22281,Great hat but unfortunately they smashed into a small box and it was completely out of shape when it was received.,22281,2
22281,Had to return it :(  Debating whether to try again.,22281,2
22282,In the size chart it said large fits 5-6 year olds.,22282,2
22282,My son is 6 and he can float in the shirt.,22282,2
22282,"It won't fit him for another 2 years, at which time it is besides the point of getting it for him.",22282,2
22283,not that good,22283,2
22284,Too large.,22284,2
22285,Shrank up passed my knees,22285,2
22286,Should have order a size larger.,22286,2
22286,Ran small.,22286,2
22287,I don't like the material it's made with ... it feels cheap.,22287,2
22287,"The way it falls on my body looks a bit awkward, too.",22287,2
22287,"However, that second part may just be due to my body shape (wide shoulders, narrow hips).",22287,2
22287,I have a crochet-lace extender from Origami that I like a lot better.,22287,2
22287,Personal preference though I guess.,22287,2
22288,"I love the ""idea"" of how these earrings look, and I love big earrings...however, these earrings are too big and heavy.",22288,2
22288,"They may look nice with the perfiect outfit, but not an everyday look.",22288,2
22288,Sorry!,22288,2
22289,Wallet is massive and doesn't hold cards well.,22289,2
22290,"Doesn't fit my bust very well and is awkward looking there as well, shorter than pictured too",22290,2
22291,The dress is too short and the fabric too heavy.,22291,2
22291,Had to return it.,22291,2
22292,"I had put it in my cart but didn't realized I ordered it until it was to late, thought I might give it a try.",22292,2
22292,It arrived and the buttons were WAY to small.,22292,2
22292,"But, the top was nice.",22292,2
22292,(Still returning it),22292,2
22293,Very cheaply made.,22293,2
22294,Very short,22294,2
22295,I loved this bag until the wheels stopped working.,22295,2
22296,Thin & cheap.,22296,2
22296,"While it runs true to size, the quality isn't worth the price.",22296,2
22296,I returned it.,22296,2
22296,"For reference, I'm 54 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28 waist 34 and ordered this in black / medium.",22296,2
22296,I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.,22296,2
22296,"I would appreciate a ""yes"" click below if you found my review helpful :)",22296,2
22297,the large is way to small,22297,2
22298,Size was extremely small.,22298,2
22298,Not worth the hassle to return so will donate it as a childs costume.,22298,2
22299,too big!,22299,2
22300,Top straps are too long (searching for a seamstress),22300,2
22301,"Pros: affordable, looks great on
Cons: broke after 1-2months.",22301,2
22301,And it did hurt as I slept on it & it always flipped upside down.,22301,2
22301,"So maybe if u take it off every day, it won't break during sleep.",22301,2
22301,:(,22301,2
22302,Two small,22302,2
22303,The suit case is a lot smaller than expected (really should be sold as a lg child's suitcase) and it has a horrible odor that I have not been able to minimize.,22303,2
22303,I am concerned and I might return them.,22303,2
22304,Very cheap looking.,22304,2
22304,I read a review that said this very same thing.,22304,2
22304,I should have headed that advice.,22304,2
22305,"Nice little watch, but the bail is very poorly made.",22305,2
22305,It fell off of the watch and will not stray when put back on.,22305,2
22306,A little on the light side and the chain is to flimsy,22306,2
22307,"The arm holes were very small, causing the jewels around them to dig into my skin.",22307,2
22307,"Very uncomfortable, returned it immediately.",22307,2
22308,"Came not working, but broke my foot & didn't have time to sort out with seller.",22308,2
22309,Would be five stars but mine DON'T float.,22309,2
22310,"I will give you a point because this thing is lightweight, portable and folds well.",22310,2
22310,"However, that's where the happiness ends.",22310,2
22310,"We used this to schlep our carry-ons (two adults, one kid, 7 carry-ons) and my husband wanted to throw it out at the layover where we ended up checking all our ""extra"" carry-ons we didn't need for the second flight.",22310,2
22310,It tips over frequently.,22310,2
22310,"Even with the built-in straps, it's hard to get stuff to stay on (and we had even packed extra bungee cords).",22310,2
22310,Most of the ways my husband would describe this cart cannot be listed on Amazon.,22310,2
22310,"It is possible PERHAPS that with heavier luggage it might work but we stacked 2 pieces of carry-on luggages and the rest of the bags (purse, backpacks, cooler) on top and it didn't work.",22310,2
22311,"Less Junior size, more small child's size.",22311,2
22312,These ring size's are NOT what they say they are!,22312,2
22312,They run SMALLER than what they say.,22312,2
22312,I'm very disappointed and I will not purchase this again!,22312,2
22313,It was nice for the price and I thought it looked nice on but the first time I wore it the chain snapped when I took it off.,22313,2
22313,I could fix it but if you don't want to bother with it don't buy this.,22313,2
22314,Smaller than expected!!!,22314,2
22314,!,22314,2
22315,Not impressed.,22315,2
22315,They smell funny and look like they are made of duct tape.,22315,2
22315,They look very cheap.,22315,2
22315,They arrived with the box completely smashed.,22315,2
22315,Will not buy again,22315,2
22316,Bust area is very small.,22316,2
22316,No stretch or give at all.,22316,2
22316,No belt as shown in picture.,22316,2
22316,Great fabric it is thick and heavy.,22316,2
22316,Easy to press or steam,22316,2
22317,I'm a pants size 12/14 and bought the 3XL size.,22317,2
22317,Can't even get them on.,22317,2
22317,Way too small.,22317,2
22318,"Runs really small, and it was expensive!",22318,2
22319,"Its very sheer, see-through almost, a bit bigger than expected per the Size chart link and an interesting feel almost silk or like a weird curtain-it might bother some people that have tactile issues to clothing against their skin.",22319,2
22319,Item returned for credit.,22319,2
22320,This skirt is being sold by several retailers on Amazon.,22320,2
22320,"I wish I had gone to one of them, but this was so cheap I figured I could use it for a sewing project if need be.",22320,2
22320,The need be.,22320,2
22320,"This skirt arrived and looked like it was decently made, had no odor of plastic or anything, and was the right set of colors.",22320,2
22320,"However, I had to struggle a bit to pull it on.",22320,2
22320,"That's when I made the discovery that most of the waistband had been completely sewn off, and was twisted to boot!",22320,2
22320,It's almost always a bad sign when you have to look for the waistband on a skirt like this.,22320,2
22320,The material was so ill-gathered the skirt couldn't possibly flow like it should.,22320,2
22320,I kept the skirt as the seller's return policy was not conducive to sending it back.,22320,2
22320,I may just cut it up and make some pillows with it--I'll let you know!,22320,2
22321,This necklace has bubbles under the glass that are right on the cat's eyes.,22321,2
22321,I got another from the seller and there was the same issue.,22321,2
22322,i love it but the color changed within 3 days,22322,2
22323,they are pretty but not as sturdy as I would like.,22323,2
22324,I have ordered similar tunics from other merchants and they fit much nicer.,22324,2
22324,This was too tight.,22324,2
22324,It was very cute though so I was disappointed.,22324,2
22324,I gave it as a gift.,22324,2
22325,My two teen daughters were recently going to a school dance and needed new dresses as they both have outgrown their previous ones.,22325,2
22325,One daughter found a dress locally that we purchased but the other daughter wanted to look online hoping for a greater selection.,22325,2
22325,"We found this dress and, at $35-$40, it was priced similarly to the dress purchased locally.",22325,2
22325,"In addition, it is similar (not identical) in styling and both dresses are black.",22325,2
22325,We purchased it thinking that the quality would be comparable but... it definitely is not!,22325,2
22325,This dress is made of a cheap lace and underlining and is not constructed nearly as well as the dress we purchased locally (that one fit well and has a zip-up back).,22325,2
22325,"In addition, there was a small hole in the lining in the back and the dress had deep creases and wrinkles that were difficult to remove because the manufacturer had crumpled up dress and crammed it into a bag that was much too small.",22325,2
22325,The bust area runs large because of the long shoulder straps and the dress left my daughter uncomfortable due to the amount of cleavage that was left on display.,22325,2
22325,"Fortunately, I know how to sew and was able to take in the straps and repair the hole (we did not have enough time to return the dress and re-order a different one).",22325,2
22325,"Since there isn't a zipper or button in back, however, we were limited in the amount the dress could be altered (without deconstructing the entire thing) while still allowing for enough headroom to slip the dress on.",22325,2
22325,"So, if you are smaller breasted, this dress may not work for you at all.",22325,2
22325,"A couple of the seams were rather ratty, too, and we had to snip several threads that were sticking out in random places.",22325,2
22325,"Although the dress (after alterations) was cute once she was wearing it (hence 2 stars rather than one), neither of us would purchase it again.",22325,2
22326,I was expecting this to be made of wire bent and it's like metal etched or something.,22326,2
22326,I found it uncomfortable and unattractive.,22326,2
22327,"The German flag is BLACK, Red, Yellow... this pillow is clearly GREEN, Red, Yellow.",22327,2
22328,CONS:  Wayyyyyy too dark.,22328,2
22328,Like welding glasses dark.,22328,2
22328,Like the only time I could actually wear them was when I was in Jamaica in a cloudless sky at high noon...and even then I was tripping over things.,22328,2
22328,PROS: I looked amazing.,22328,2
22328,"Conclusion:  Impractical for daily use, unless you weld outside at midday",22328,2
22329,"The material is very thin, not too flattering, and not realizing this was from China, my size was too small.",22329,2
22329,It is very tight and shows all the details underneath the garment.,22329,2
22329,"The waistband is very tight and scrunched, and there's some extra fabric poking out of the seam.",22329,2
22329,It would be appreciated if there was attention brought to the size chart.,22329,2
22329,Cute though.,22329,2
22330,I order a size larger than my normal size because of site recommendation the shorts were still too small.,22330,2
22331,It looks like it is cut out of a rubber inner tube.,22331,2
22331,Not shiny like the picture,22331,2
22332,The color is way darker than the pictures show.,22332,2
22332,It's actually navy blue,22332,2
22333,Too much excess material in the waist/hip area.,22333,2
22334,It happy with this at all.,22334,2
22334,"Is of course it only cost a few $, but the sizing was extremely too large",22334,2
22335,"The quality is okay, nothing special.",22335,2
22335,The color is not a true black.,22335,2
22335,I am returning this.,22335,2
22336,The tank stringer itself fits well and is decent quality.,22336,2
22336,Sadly the screen printing is pretty bad.,22336,2
22336,It's the super thick kind I remember as a kid that leaves a sweat spot because it's so thick and hot and starts falling apart as you wear it.,22336,2
22336,The cracks and separations you can see in my photo are after only one washing.,22336,2
22336,If I didn't like Capt.,22336,2
22336,America so much I'd have probably given it one star.,22336,2
22337,I expected a better and stronger belt.,22337,2
22337,If I hadn't distroyed the box I would return it for a stronger belt.,22337,2
22337,Respectively  Al,22337,2
22338,This item is too short for my torso and kept rolling down.,22338,2
22338,I ended up buying one of the major brands instead.,22338,2
22339,I love the way these leggings look but they size is way off.,22339,2
22339,I ordered and large and could barely fit it.,22339,2
22339,I gave them to my sister who is size small and they were still to tight and didn't fit right.,22339,2
22339,There is no distinction between the front or the back so it doesn't give enough coverage in the butt area.,22339,2
22340,The dress has potential but it is not true to size.,22340,2
22340,The knot is in an odd spot making the whole chest area very tight.,22340,2
22341,I didn't receive the belt with my jumper.,22341,2
22342,Tiny and they screw together hard to put on.,22342,2
22343,I LOVED this shirt when i put it on the first time...,22343,2
22343,However after one wash there was a hole in one of the sleeves so i had to throw away.,22343,2
22344,Ordered an 18 month outfit and it's kinda of small.,22344,2
22345,Thin material and very short.,22345,2
22346,"Its a beautiful purse, but it doesnt look like the images provided.",22346,2
22347,Hat was too big,22347,2
22348,I had to return this.,22348,2
22348,"I ordered the X-large but it was so tiny, that it was probably an American small or medium at best.",22348,2
22348,"Too bad, because the print was really cute.",22348,2
22349,"This tote bag was originally advertised as genuine leather, and I actually bought the brown and the wine red colors.",22349,2
22349,"After I received this first one, I thoroughly checked it to verify if it was really genuine cowhide leather and determined that it is man made PU leather.",22349,2
22349,"I therefore returned the 2nd one, but kept the brown one because I have already started to use it..
Sure enough, the seller of the item changed it's posting to ZMSnow Designer PU Leather Handbag after I returned the other bag.",22349,2
22349,BEWARE; All it is; a mere imitation from China .. Do Not Buy It - Unless you do not mind the fake-synthetic material.,22349,2
22350,Looked comfy but totally sheer.,22350,2
22350,Was not comfortable wearing them.,22350,2
22350,Sent them back.,22350,2
22351,I nearly got trapped in the shirt.,22351,2
22351,The arms were way too small for me.,22351,2
22352,Ok the top was too large the bottoms fit perfect the over shirt was sewn together weird.,22352,2
22352,Where it crosses over it bulged open like it didn't fit but I had plenty of room??,22352,2
22352,Wanted to send it back but wasn't going to pay for shipping.,22352,2
22352,Sidefeel did take care of the situation to my satisfaction since I'm stuck with a bathing suit I can not wear.,22352,2
22353,Not a comfortable fit.,22353,2
22354,Not really happy with this.,22354,2
22354,The hat is a bit small but it's not bad looks cute on my 10 year old.,22354,2
22355,Runs short for a regular medium,22355,2
22356,Chain broke within one week.,22356,2
22356,Not good quality.,22356,2
22357,Pretty but fimsy,22357,2
22358,"Not a fan, not anything like the KSO made in China.",22358,2
22358,Not comfortable and the high top rubs the back of my heel.,22358,2
22358,"Wore 2 times, and and lost some money buying them.",22358,2
22359,Top was huge...bottoms fit perfect.,22359,2
22359,Very weird material.... Not regular bathing suit.,22359,2
22359,More like a wet suit.,22359,2
22360,Didnt get what was shown in picture Which sucks cuz i was really excited about them got mostly cheap looking dots that i probably won't be using,22360,2
22361,looks cheap and smaller than expected,22361,2
22362,I gave it to my daughter she loved it...,22362,2
22363,hat would have been great except when it was folded in half and scrunched up in a bag so it does not straighten out.,22363,2
22363,In the creased areas the had is now coming apart.,22363,2
22364,Order them in black and white stripe and I received them in red and white.,22364,2
22365,I don't like the material of this clothes,22365,2
22366,The fit is perfect.,22366,2
22366,"However, the elastic around the ankles are so tight.",22366,2
22366,It makes the pjs so uncomfortable.,22366,2
22367,Not worth it,22367,2
22368,awaiting return instructions,22368,2
22369,"Looks very cheap and was,  so you get what you pay for.",22369,2
22369,I only wore once...around the house but probably won't wear again.,22369,2
22370,neck line is very high,22370,2
22371,The nylons ran immediately.,22371,2
22371,Waste of money.,22371,2
22371,The SPANX's portion was great but nylons were very disappointing.,22371,2
22372,"An odd fit - roomy enough in bust and butt, but not long enough in the torso.",22372,2
22372,"Also, the lack of stretch in the crochet was a problem - did not conform to my waist, and gave me a really rectangular look.",22372,2
22372,"I'm 5'8, 130lbs, 34A and bought a large.",22372,2
22372,This may work better on shorter women.,22372,2
22373,"They were too narrow for my feet, and for some reason, Vans doesn't offer a wide.",22373,2
22373,I was really dissatisfied and disappointed.,22373,2
22374,Poor quality product.,22374,2
22374,"Too see-through, size does not fit me well - not because of the size, just the overall fit.",22374,2
22374,feels cheap.,22374,2
22375,It says surgical steel but it's plastic.,22375,2
22375,It looks kind of like the picture but it's not the same.,22375,2
22375,It's cute and I get plenty of compliments on it but it's not what I expected.,22375,2
22376,Not what I ordered.,22376,2
22376,This skirt is no where near as long as it's pictured.....,22376,2
22376,I don't know who they figured it would hit the floor with but I wanted a LONG flows skirt.,22376,2
22376,Color was right I guess,22376,2
22377,It works but isn't as pretty as the picture.,22377,2
22377,I paid very little for it so I am keeping it and wearing it.,22377,2
22378,I've owned too many Dooneys to remember.,22378,2
22378,I sent this one back because the texture felt rubbery or maybe too synthetic.,22378,2
22378,Not the quality I'm accustomed to but I chalk it up to design/material flaw.,22378,2
22378,"It appeared to be genuine Dooney & Bourke,though, and included the registration cards.",22378,2
22378,"Otherwise, I might have doubted it.",22378,2
22378,There was a plastic/rubbery odor as well.,22378,2
22379,It was too large and too short.,22379,2
22379,It was a large tank top,22379,2
22380,The hoodie was good but the cuffs were to tight.,22380,2
22380,They were not normal.,22380,2
22380,They also would not get stretched out.,22380,2
22380,I think it's a waste of money,22380,2
22381,"Too short and too small on arms
Not the exact red it shows in photo",22381,2
22382,I ordered this to wear to work but the white portions of the dress are completely see through.,22382,2
22382,The fit and shape are cute but I can't wear it to work.,22382,2
22382,I will have to return it.,22382,2
22383,I had a very difficult time sowing this patch on even with a machine.,22383,2
22383,It looks cool tho,22383,2
22384,I had to return.,22384,2
22384,Only for girls or women with skinny legs,22384,2
22385,"My feet didn't feel any better than what I started with and for the price I paid, they should have done something.",22385,2
22385,Dr. Scholls are $2 more and feel much better.,22385,2
22386,Wore it for a couple weeks and the gold flakes off.,22386,2
22386,What ever material it's made out of is now irritating my piercing.,22386,2
22386,Could find another gold plated ring for similar price.,22386,2
22387,"Cheap, clasp broke",22387,2
22388,These aren't true to size.,22388,2
22388,Barely fit my grand daughter and if her foot grows any then they will be a total waste of my money.,22388,2
22388,"If anyone order these, order at least 1 to 1 1/2 size bigger.",22388,2
22389,Too Small,22389,2
22390,Way way too large.,22390,2
22390,Disappointed in the sizing.,22390,2
22391,The size runs to small,22391,2
22392,These were inexpensive earrings.,22392,2
22392,So there's not much to complain about.,22392,2
22392,But they do look cheap in person.,22392,2
22393,Kinda cheesy!,22393,2
22393,"Very low quality
Looks like dollar store stuff But the back is cute
I got medium and the sleeve is too short",22393,2
22394,It's kinda okay but the pendant holder broke the first time I wore it.,22394,2
22395,Too small.,22395,2
22395,I had to send it back.,22395,2
22396,Cheap and shabbily made.,22396,2
22397,"I wanted to really like these but the give no curve, completely flat, look kinda weird on.",22397,2
22398,Bracelet is way too big.,22398,2
22398,It would fit a man.,22398,2
22398,It falls off my wrist.,22398,2
22399,It was very short,22399,2
22400,Not really what I expected.,22400,2
22400,Need to lose a little weight to wear these comfortably.,22400,2
22401,Top too big in cup size .,22401,2
22401,Bottoms just right,22401,2
22402,The item was entirely toooo small  and i ordered a size up.,22402,2
22403,I was disappointed it was too small but it fit my daughter so i gave it to her and it looks good on her.,22403,2
22404,had to return this way too small,22404,2
22405,"I bought this to wear for my baby shower and although the dress itself was really nice and super comfortable, I only gave it 2 stars because of the fit.",22405,2
22405,"I prefer to have something a little more form fitting, not super tight but something that shows I'm pregnant and not just big and this didn't do it for me.",22405,2
22405,I put it on and it kinda just hangs so I looked massive!,22405,2
22405,"It just wasn't my preference of fit, which bummed me out because it is a cute dress.",22405,2
22406,Too big to wear.,22406,2
22406,It really needs to air out because it does smell.,22406,2
22407,These fit terrible!,22407,2
22407,They do not stay up and then look absolutely ugly.,22407,2
22407,Fabric is nice though.,22407,2
22407,I won't buy these again.,22407,2
22408,Love the pattern on the skirt but the dress was too small,22408,2
22409,"I bought these because they had relatively high reviews, however I did not have such luck with this product.",22409,2
22409,"These are still visible while wearing, it looks like a huge flat clear disk on your nose with a big dark spot in the middle.",22409,2
22409,I bought these for a career fair and ended up just leaving my nose stud in because these looked so ridiculous.,22409,2
22409,"I don't know if it's due to the angle of my piercing or what, but I'm really disappointed that I payed so much money for little pits of plastic, and to not have them work in the way I want them to.",22409,2
22410,"If your breast grow near your belly button, this is the suit for you!",22410,2
22410,It did arrive super fast though.,22410,2
22410,"I ordered 2 sizes larger, I would suggest going 3 sizes and if you're anything larger than a B cup, don't even bother.",22410,2
22411,the colors don't look like the picture.,22411,2
22411,material is ok.,22411,2
22412,I really like the look of this ring and have gotten compliments but it is definitely a size to large.,22412,2
22413,Size not correctly stated.,22413,2
22414,Thin and too small,22414,2
22415,This item was pretty disappointing.,22415,2
22415,"It's a lot heavier than most adhesive silicone bras I have used so throughout the day, the edges start to unstick from the weight of being pulled down.",22415,2
22415,"It's supposedly reusable but most of the adhesive on the edges peeled off during my first wear, leaving the product exposed as just silicon.",22415,2
22415,It probably wouldn't be safe to wear again considering it might leave me with a wardrobe malfunction.,22415,2
22415,I've had other adhesive bras that I've reused at least 20 times.,22415,2
22415,Had such high hopes because the reviews were so high for this.,22415,2
22415,I'm giving it two stars because the product lasted me through the first wear and is true to size.,22415,2
22415,I'm a 34C and i got the C cup which fit perfectly.,22415,2
22416,The material is not that great and the zipper came broken....and poor stitching....,22416,2
22417,Ran to small,22417,2
22418,Blouse is very pretty but just fits so snugly.,22418,2
22419,Something was just off with the way this swimsuit fitted,22419,2
22420,Ok so i loved the pattern and the softness and how they fit me legs....but the top is too tight the elastic is too high goes above the belly button and pulls too tight.,22420,2
22420,If i got a bigger size then it would be toobig in the legs,22420,2
22421,"Ordered black, but is blue like blue jeans.",22421,2
22422,cheaply made.,22422,2
22422,raw serging on edges.,22422,2
22422,body is too short so makes it creep up and cut in at the shoulders.,22422,2
22422,but really i sent it back because the stitching was so poor and the decal on the front was peeling.,22422,2
22423,Completely see through in white,22423,2
22424,Loved the different designs unfortunately the silver wore off after one wearing very disappointed.,22424,2
22425,I would call them tights rather than leggings.,22425,2
22425,Way too close fitting for leggings.,22425,2
22426,These were way too small!,22426,2
22426,I had to return them also they made my butt look super flat.,22426,2
22426,Not very flattering,22426,2
22427,the neck-tie broke very soon after putting it on.,22427,2
22427,The ears also low quality as well as the tail.,22427,2
22428,"Is not what I expected, to small",22428,2
22429,"Loved the bathing suit; however, it ripped after the first wash.",22429,2
22429,It now has two big holes at the seam and I won't be able to wear it again.,22429,2
22429,It was debastating because it fit so well and I received many compliments when wearing this one piece on vacation.,22429,2
22430,Not really what I expected,22430,2
22431,I am thinking of ordering some of these for my grandkids.,22431,2
22431,The pictures look good and the price is right.,22431,2
22431,In order to select size I read the reviews and then went to their site.,22431,2
22431,The site confirms the reviews.,22431,2
22431,"The hats are clearly ""one size fits most"".",22431,2
22431,I will probably put in XL and assume I can wash them to size for kids.,22431,2
22431,Don't think the size means anything.,22431,2
22431,"In fact, I would expect small and don't dare wash in other than cold.",22431,2
22431,It actually is just WRONG to put size as an option.,22431,2
22431,"From the site :

ONE SIZE fits most, soft and cool material.",22431,2
22431,Hand wash only.,22431,2
22431,"Imported

22431,Approximate Total Hat Width: 11 in.,22431,2
22432,ok product.,22432,2
22432,It looks just like the picture until you wait 5 minutes and it is turned upside down!,22432,2
22433,This dress was supposed to be green.,22433,2
22433,It was not as pictured--more teal than anything.,22433,2
22433,"Fit was fine and fabric was cheap, but for the price, as expected.",22433,2
22434,I don't care for the look of this in person.,22434,2
22434,It doesn't look like the picture.,22434,2
22434,What I received does have the fringe but looks like something you would wear for a Star Wars outfit.,22434,2
22435,"NICE LOOKING, WELL MADE AND ROOMEY.",22435,2
22435,BUT SHOULDER STRAP HOOKS ON CROOKED SO YOU CANNOT CARRY ON SHOULDER.,22435,2
22436,It's very  very large even when I bought one size less.,22436,2
22437,It does not look like the picture,22437,2
22438,"I love this costume, but I was very disappointed by noticing it arrived unstitched :(",22438,2
22439,Cheap China stuff.,22439,2
22439,Not happy Amazon !,22439,2
22440,zipper broke second day owning it,22440,2
22441,"Better quality than expected, but just far too small, even using the Asian measurements.",22441,2
22442,Love the lace but the body of the shirt is this cheap shear fabric that seems like the lining of pants or a skirt .,22442,2
22443,crappy material,22443,2
22444,Some didn't have eye holes cut out but arrived sealed and quickly as expected.,22444,2
22444,I probably will spend an extra couple of bucks next time for higher quality masks as these were really low quality.,22444,2
22445,"The plastic garter pieces broke the first time putting it on, worthless without the garter to hold in place.",22445,2
22446,Cheap looking but hey for the price you get what you pay for.,22446,2
22447,bad,22447,2
22448,Great looking shoes.,22448,2
22448,Too bad they didn't fit.,22448,2
22448,I returned them over 2 weeks ago and haven't heard back from them.,22448,2
22449,Comfy but not warm.,22449,2
22449,Non zip pockets are for loosing things.,22449,2
22450,"Super cute, ripped the first time I wore it.",22450,2
22450,"Got another one at the same time that did not, so it might be worth the risk.",22450,2
22451,"The measurements were not as expected, and this is definitely not burgundy.",22451,2
22451,Its a red color.,22451,2
22452,Not a good fit.,22452,2
22452,Order one size bigger still to small,22452,2
22453,"Don't like the product,  in the pictures of the items they look better and not so dull.",22453,2
22453,"The items fit, I don't like that are dull and just look dirty",22453,2
22454,I had high hopes for these shoes!,22454,2
22454,I bought these for the thick reinforced toe (my son tends to bust through the toes on all of his shoes).,22454,2
22454,"I loved the look of them too, however, the velcro straps wore down after only 6 weeks of use!",22454,2
22454,Now off to find him another pair...,22454,2
22455,It was too short for my ear so sadly I can't wear it but other than that its really nice just wish the bar were longer,22455,2
22456,A very tight 3XL and is very short.,22456,2
22456,This would only possibly work as an undershirt unless your need for 3XL is all muscle and no belly.,22456,2
22457,Nice plants but they run small and shrink incredibly.,22457,2
22458,Definitely not as flowy as the photos make it appear.,22458,2
22458,"The skirt doesn't really move well when walking around, as the material is kind of limp and heavy.",22458,2
22459,This dress is inferiorly made and ill fitting.,22459,2
22459,"The neckline is not as depicted and constantly slides off one shoulder, the print is crooked and veers to one side, and the front hem is noticeably higher than the back hem.",22459,2
22459,But I'm keeping it for shlepping around the house.,22459,2
22459,Definitely not good enough to wear out.,22459,2
22460,"Ordered a size bigger as instructed, way too big.",22460,2
22461,sizing is off,22461,2
22462,This thing is big; I feel like a bear in it.,22462,2
22462,I already gave it away.,22462,2
22462,:/,22462,2
22463,Chain broke after a month,22463,2
22464,"Bought this for my husband as a gift, it broke three days later.",22464,2
22464,:(,22464,2
22465,"Disappointed,",22465,2
22466,The jacket and tie are worth the purchase but....The shirt fits ok and the pants are horrible.,22466,2
22466,I bought w large since most costumes run small.,22466,2
22466,"I am 5'5"" size 8 and the pants came down every time I bent over and they also were the length of capris.",22466,2
22466,I decided to wear a black shirt and bought black and white striped jeans and it looks perfect with the cute jacket.,22466,2
22467,Very see through!,22467,2
22468,"quality was ""eh""",22468,2
22469,This was way to small!,22469,2
22469,Not at all like the picture,22469,2
22470,Super tight on the neck,22470,2
22471,"This strap is supposed to be white, but it's a soft pink, also pretty sure that when I  ordered it, it was called light tan, (one of three color choices) but I definitely don't want pink.",22471,2
22471,"But the quality is great, no problem with the strap other than not the color I ordered,  and Amazon is taking it back, I've already ordered and received another (tan) fossil band, and I  love it!",22471,2
22472,Very cheaply made.,22472,2
22472,The sleeves are hemmed with bonding strips (not actually sewn).,22472,2
22472,"And apparently, they didn't heat the iron up enough so it didn't even bond.",22472,2
22472,"Also, the lining is so baggy that it hangs down beneath the bottom of the blazer.",22472,2
22472,I will have to use my own sewing skills to make this blazer look decent.,22472,2
22473,Cool looking item but her name is miss spelled.,22473,2
22474,"you want them tight, but its mesh.",22474,2
22474,think about how the boys are going to look.,22474,2
22475,Wings look much smaller and the rings itself are making my nipples itch,22475,2
22476,Cute!,22476,2
22476,The problem was that the charms did not come as they look in the photo.,22476,2
22476,"The Celtic knot is the largest and should be in the middle, instead the ""K"" was in the center.",22476,2
22476,I did have to use pliers and switch them.,22476,2
22477,"gathered in weird areas, also too long.",22477,2
22478,"I ordered to large and even though I received them I do not like them, very narrow also.",22478,2
22478,I am returning them.,22478,2
22479,It's too small didn't fit will be returning,22479,2
22480,if you have boobs don't buy,22480,2
22481,My wife bought this crap.,22481,2
22482,Long but very tight.,22482,2
22482,And thin.,22482,2
22482,Could snag.,22482,2
22482,More like opaque tights/pantyhose than leggings.,22482,2
22483,I didn't have high expectations for this because the price was so low but I was not expecting it to be so large.,22483,2
22483,"It has no shape and unless you are super petite, it looks like a moo moo.",22483,2
22483,Nice fabric although it's thin.,22483,2
22483,And the pockets were nice.,22483,2
22483,Overall just not for me.,22483,2
22484,This is a cute cap but has a shallow dome.,22484,2
22484,"It you have a decent size cranium and hair, it does not want to stay down.",22484,2
22484,Maybe if you had a smaller head it would stay in place and be a good deal for style and value.,22484,2
22485,Runs small,22485,2
22486,I was actually pretty disappointed with this.,22486,2
22486,I read a bunch of positive reviews which helped me make the decision to purchase it.,22486,2
22486,"However, when I received it and tried it on it was a bit too small.",22486,2
22486,I'm pretty small weighing only about 120 and standing about 5'4.,22486,2
22486,Some reviews said it did run small so i chose to get a medium and it was still a bit tight.,22486,2
22486,My other issue with it was how unbelievably see through it is.,22486,2
22486,There is no way I can wear the jumpsuit without another piece of clothing underneath and on top.,22486,2
22486,The material is also very cheap feeling it almost felt like halloween costume material.,22486,2
22486,I was pretty disappointed overall and don't think i will be wearing this.,22486,2
22487,Underwire bra was useless - not a good fit,22487,2
22488,I really like the style of the purse.,22488,2
22488,It's cute and just the right size.,22488,2
22488,Of course you get what you pay for.,22488,2
22488,Unfortunately the chain does not actually attach to the bag.,22488,2
22488,There's also a snag on the bag.,22488,2
22488,"Lastly, the chain is a different color gold than the closure.",22488,2
22488,I can manage without the chain but I prefer not to have to hold the purse in my hands.,22488,2
22489,Thank you for  my purse.,22489,2
22489,The 1st 3 days of having it the zipper was already broken.,22489,2
22489,I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back.wait a week or 2 for a new one,22489,2
22490,Ordered a size up from my normal and it was still too small,22490,2
22491,"This is absolutely awful on me, not flattering in the least.",22491,2
22491,"I am a size 4/6, 5'3"", and there was about 8"" of extra fabric at the bust, the armholes dangled several inches too low, and the sleeves were about 3"" inches above my wrist (in the garment's defense I do have long arms).",22491,2
22491,"The material quality was OK, an opaque crepe; and the lace quality was pretty good, sturdy and not very scratchy.",22491,2
22491,I would have kept it and altered myself if not for the too-short arms.,22491,2
22491,The dress you see is not what you receive.,22491,2
22491,The picture is of a designer apparel item.,22491,2
22491,"I was not expecting the designer item, but i was expecting something closer to it than what i got.",22491,2
22491,It was packaged very nicely in a heavy resealable (ziplock style) plastic bag.,22491,2
22491,"Steer clear of this one unless you have about a 38"" bust, average to narrow shoulders, and shorter arms; thicker arms should be OK.",22491,2
22491,"If you're under 5'4"" this is a good length for a mini dress, taller ladies will find it a good tunic length.",22491,2
22491,EDIT: Added picture.,22491,2
22491,The company also contacted me regarding my negative review.,22491,2
22491,"They didn't ask me to change it or anything, but offered me a discount for a different item of my choice.",22491,2
22491,I added a star for the attention paid to customer satisfaction.,22491,2
22492,"ordered large for my daughter, was much too small for her, material was too thin and sewing was unraveled",22492,2
22493,It was not the dress we order we get a gray dress nothing like the picture,22493,2
22494,"Fragile, fake but cute.",22494,2
22495,"Cute but I got the 6-12 mos and my baby is 8 months, 20 lbs and it's a little too small.",22495,2
22496,necklace came in whole and was beautiful for about a week before it started to tarnish.,22496,2
22497,I ordered this dress because it looked so good in the pictures.,22497,2
22497,"When I got it in the mail, the package fit in my condo mailbox,which was already a bad sign.",22497,2
22497,That is because the fabric is really thin and looks like a cheap tablecloth.,22497,2
22497,It is not see through however which is some of its few pros.,22497,2
22497,"The others are that it fits nicely and the print is pretty, although not nearly as nice as it looks in the pictures.",22497,2
22497,"Again, the dress looks cheaply made.",22497,2
22497,"It has some flaps in the interior part of the collar that should be sown, but aren't which is really annoying.",22497,2
22497,"The belt is a joke, it can barely be called a belt since it doesn't come with anything to hold it in place.",22497,2
22497,Wearing it kind of ruins the dress instead of giving a nice effect.,22497,2
22497,Here are some pictures for you to see for yourselves.,22497,2
22497,"To me, these kind of details are the touches that define the quality of a garment and hence I'm giving it 2 stars.",22497,2
22497,"The price is not bad,but honestly you can get a better quality dress for the same price at H&M, for instance.",22497,2
22497,Just don't buy it,22497,2
22498,I ordered these after having great success with the Thomas training underwear.,22498,2
22498,These for some reason fit smaller than Thomas ones that are the same size (3T).,22498,2
22498,Plus like others have said I did not receive the colors shown.,22498,2
22498,I got the orange and blue ones which isn't a big deal but I was really looking forward to the ones shown.,22498,2
22499,"Hard to leave a positive review because my $210 Retro 5 Jordan's have still creased and I only wear them maybe once every 1-2 weeks, plus I even put the styrofoam back into the shoes when I'm not wearing them, this may prolong the creasing but it definitely doesn't completely prevent it",22499,2
22500,Pretty but the thread is rubbish.,22500,2
22500,I could hear it tearing as I stretched it over my head.,22500,2
22500,I purchased thread and restitched it then it was fine.,22500,2
22500,"Pretty but if you can't sew, don't bother.",22500,2
22500,You have to restitch the outfit.,22500,2
22501,Warm but is too small.,22501,2
22501,Needs to be longer to cover my dumbo ears.,22501,2
22502,the material keeps falling off,22502,2
22503,Not thermal and the print in the product description photos is not what I received.,22503,2
22503,"Other than that, the quality is ok for knit jersey t-shirt fabric.",22503,2
22503,"I am 5'11"" 165 lbs with a 31"" waist and 32"" inseam.",22503,2
22503,The Asian XL is my size but I am returning these because I don't like actual print.,22503,2
22503,It's too Union Jack busy for my taste.,22503,2
22504,"This dress was incredibly cute, and as described, but for larger busted women, it won't fit.",22504,2
22504,The chest was WAY too small and the rest of the dress looked and fit great.,22504,2
22504,Had to return it because it didn't fit.,22504,2
22505,"Super cute, but bust way too big.",22505,2
22505,"No kidding, order three sizes bigger than what you wear in the US.",22505,2
22506,"The sleeves are too small I can't wear it because it's too uncomfortable,  the color is not as bright as in the picture.",22506,2
22507,Bought this as a best man gift and was not satisfied with the appearance.,22507,2
22507,It has the correctly listed dimensions but looks and feels cheap in person.,22507,2
22507,"Needless to say, I am not gifting this to my best man.",22507,2
22508,The pattern is very cute.,22508,2
22508,"The top fit perfectly, although has a cheap metal back clasp.",22508,2
22508,The bottoms were WAY to small.,22508,2
22508,Even trying to stretch them there is no way those will fit.,22508,2
22508,"I ordered a small and I am 5'2, 103lbs.",22508,2
22509,Super cute but way too tight in the chest,22509,2
22510,"This wig has potential, but it was so small that it barely fit on my six year old's head, let alone an adult.",22510,2
22511,Very cute.,22511,2
22511,Hard to put on and bends vary easy.,22511,2
22511,Over all ok case but not people who are hard in your phone.,22511,2
22511,Mirror scratches pretty easy.,22511,2
22512,Ran kind of small and the material is a bit stiff.,22512,2
22513,The small fits like a medium...i'm a bit disappointed.,22513,2
22514,"I wanted to love this shirt but it was sooooo SMALLL I got a large and it was like a XS I couldn't believe it, would not recommend",22514,2
22515,does not stay on the ear,22515,2
22516,Disappointed with the sizing.,22516,2
22516,I also didn't get return information.,22516,2
22516,I'm going to have to give it away.,22516,2
22516,Darn.,22516,2
22517,The bottom fit just fine but the top was too big.,22517,2
22517,There are no hooks or clasps for adjusting so I had to pin it at the last minute,22517,2
22518,Much larger and heavier than I expected...,22518,2
22519,"pretty print, but way too long.",22519,2
22519,I'm 5'7 and covers my ankles.,22519,2
22519,"Because it runs small, I ordered a larger size for the width, but the lengh is way too long needs to be altered.",22519,2
22520,Too big,22520,2
22521,much smaller than I expected.,22521,2
22522,Looks cheap,22522,2
22523,Looks cheap but for the price its cute for younger girls,22523,2
22524,I like the shirt but it does fit a bit tight normally for an xl shirt i never have a problem with fit but this xl shirt runs a bit on the smaller size was thinking about buying another shirt but changed my mind due to the way the current one fits,22524,2
22525,Pretty surprised at how much I didn't like this watch.,22525,2
22525,"Coming off of the Apple Watch, I wanted something a little less expensive.",22525,2
22525,You definitely get what you pay for.,22525,2
22525,The apps are not really iOS friendly.,22525,2
22525,"The phone app and the watch themselves are in a different language, so it is hard to set up.",22525,2
22525,"Not a lot of bells and whistles, or customization available.",22525,2
22526,"I actually liked this dress, but it was far too large.",22526,2
22526,I ordered a size up (M) after reading some reviews.,22526,2
22526,I ended up returning it.,22526,2
22526,Go with your typical US size when you order.,22526,2
22527,Ordered a size up and it is still too small.,22527,2
22527,Cute shirt but I had to give it to my little sister.,22527,2
22528,Cute but too small,22528,2
22529,"Flat top septums are no good, at least for me.",22529,2
22529,I cannot wear them as long as I can wear a fully rounded clicker.. Worth the price but don't expect to be able to wear it constantly,22529,2
22530,Order bigger size.,22530,2
22530,Maybe 2 sizes.,22530,2
22530,"It looks good but it is not a raincoat....I repeat, NOT A RAIN COAT OR WATERPROOF IN ANY WAY!!.",22530,2
22530,"If you just want a light windbreaker, get it.",22530,2
22530,I was looking g for a rain jacketo and it does not work for that.,22530,2
22530,"My bad, I should have read the reviews.",22530,2
22531,Hard to put on and off -- thought I would like - but I do not,22531,2
22532,quality of both material and make is poor and the fit is somewhat large,22532,2
22533,Run small,22533,2
22534,Better sizing chart I got the X-Large and it didn't fit,22534,2
22535,Too small.,22535,2
22535,Not as big as I expected or wanted,22535,2
22536,Too small around arm area!,22536,2
22536,!,22536,2
22537,The shirt and headband fit great and look cute on my daughter.,22537,2
22537,She is going to be 3 in October.,22537,2
22537,I bought a 4t and the shorts are very large and fall off of her but the shirt fits like a glove.,22537,2
22537,She can normally wear 2t-3t and if I got a size smaller the shirt would not have fit her.,22537,2
22538,Custome was unbreathable.,22538,2
22538,Not as stretchy as other reviews stated....would not recommend for anyone whos 5ft...and the mask was horrible.,22538,2
22539,My coworker bought this dress in black and said it was great.,22539,2
22539,"I ordered the dark gray, size 4 (I wear a size 0/XS) and I threw it out after one wear.",22539,2
22539,The fabric is soooo thin.,22539,2
22539,"On one of the sides, the ruching was virtually non-existent.",22539,2
22539,"It had like 3 stitches, which the other side was fully ruched, a good 6 inches.",22539,2
22539,The dress rode up ALL day and I was self conscious - thankfully wore it with a long sweater and a scarf I was able to hide behind.,22539,2
22539,Not recommended.,22539,2
22539,"The brand listing is ""Zeta Ville Maternity"" - the label in the dark gray dress I got was ""Happy Mama.""",22539,2
22539,Perhaps this accounts for the difference in quality.,22539,2
22539,$25 is cheap but not a good deal for only one wear.,22539,2
22540,There is a very good reason they do not show an actual person wearing this necklace...,22540,2
22540,"If they did, you would be able to see exactly how SMALL it is.",22540,2
22540,"It is 4 inches across, however, the photo makes it look like it is twice this size.",22540,2
22540,"The 'mannequin' that it is displayed on in the picture is not the size of an actual person, it is doll sized.",22540,2
22540,"When an actual person is wearing it, it does not cover the chest as shown, but only sits under the neck.",22540,2
22541,"the lace was very nice the shirt itself I would never wear outside, very sheer, material was not cotton as I had expected.",22541,2
22542,beads fall off easily but was great for the one outfit I needed it for for that day.,22542,2
22542,One time use.,22542,2
22543,EXTREMELLY SMALL,22543,2
22544,First of all the fabric was so thin I was worried that I'd easily tear it.,22544,2
22544,Then it was so small that I couldn't get my arms in the coat and I'd ordered a size above what I normally wear (which is how I like my coats).,22544,2
22544,I think they're Asian sizes (??).,22544,2
22544,It was soft but didn't look too warm,22544,2
22545,It was great at first but then after a couple weeks of wearing it after my daughter's C-Section the Velcro has come apart from the panty.,22545,2
22545,It's a fabulous idea but they just need a way to keep the velcro from coming apart!,22545,2
22546,"Super cute, but my nephew managed to break the screen off of it within like 2 days... should be made a little tougher for toddlers.",22546,2
22546,He's 4.5 years old.,22546,2
22547,I've worn them and they are too small.,22547,2
22548,Ver y large,22548,2
22549,Dress runs extremely small.,22549,2
22549,Make sure you order AT LEAST one size up from what you would normally wear.,22549,2
22550,ordered an XL and it was way too small.,22550,2
22550,Gave it to my daughter.,22550,2
22551,I bought this to wear on vacation hoping to have a more playful belly button ring.,22551,2
22551,"It was great at first, I loved the dangle chain.",22551,2
22551,"Over the course of my trip, the dangle would get caught on my clothes and pull.",22551,2
22551,The bottom part of the jewelry was a few mm too long and would not sit inside of my belly button causing me pain and required adjustment.,22551,2
22552,"Not what I expected, looks more sporty in person.",22552,2
22553,Extremely small in size!,22553,2
22553,Not exactly what I was expecting....a bit disappointed.,22553,2
22554,They definitely did not fit as expected.,22554,2
22554,They are a very thin material and I will probably just sleep in them instead of wearing them to the gym.,22554,2
22555,Did not its to big and not adjustable for the average ankle,22555,2
22556,Can't wear it.,22556,2
22556,The large has no arm room,22556,2
22557,"Unfortunately, it's not waterproof (as evidenced by two spilled water bottles and and the fact that they completely drenched everything inside), and it's already starting to tear after only having it a few months.",22557,2
22557,I'm disappointed because I really liked it and expected more from the great reviews.,22557,2
22558,"Not thrilled about the top piece, I could not get it to stay.",22558,2
22558,Bottom fit ok.,22558,2
22559,Color bleeds!,22559,2
22559,Have washed these three times and color still comes off on your hands.,22559,2
22559,Great price but poor quality!,22559,2
22560,"Not a ""Travel"" umbrella.",22560,2
22560,Too big and too heavy to be 'travel' in my mind.,22560,2
22560,It seems very heavy and durable but not what I need when I have to deal with airlines weight limits on my luggage.,22560,2
22561,Bought: size 9-10 ys.,22561,2
22561,Fits maybe a 6 year old...,22561,2
22561,I am not unrealistic.,22561,2
22561,"I also bought  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0150QTU9K
in the same size (excellent fit for those)",22561,2
22562,These shoes are poorly constructed and I don't expect them to last more that one summer.,22562,2
22562,"Would not recommend, and will not order another Nike downshifter series again",22562,2
22563,they srink bad,22563,2
22564,Here's the problem with all of these a friend bought me - they have seams in the front - anyone over the age of 75-80 would think these polyester things were great.,22564,2
22564,I took them all to GoodWill.,22564,2
22564,Also no back pockets in any of these.,22564,2
22565,Gets a 2 star because it fits as expected but I gave it away because I hate the material.,22565,2
22565,It looks cotton in the picture but it's like a nylon or something hated it and the hood is ridiculous.,22565,2
22566,"the bottom doesn't fit very well, it is a little weird",22566,2
22567,The material feels like satin.,22567,2
22567,It's shiny and it's not tapered at the waist.,22567,2
22568,Be careful slimfit usually wear a large couldn't even button it,22568,2
22569,It looks nice from afar but the product is very poor quality and fits awkwardly mostly due to poor design/quality of the clip/buckle part in the back.,22569,2
22570,Bought 3 pairs of these gloves and they did not keep our hands warm or dry in the snow.,22570,2
22570,The moisture quickly went through the glove which made our hands wet and very cold.,22570,2
22570,Needed to remove the gloves after awhile as the moisture was making our hands uncomfortably cold.,22570,2
22571,This dress is too large.,22571,2
22571,I usually wear a size medium but ordered a small.,22571,2
22571,It was still too large and unflattering.,22571,2
22571,"I am 5'6"" and weigh 140 lbs.",22571,2
22572,To small,22572,2
22573,It was cheap.,22573,2
22573,The zipper broke right away,22573,2
22574,Too small,22574,2
22575,Material was cheap and leg holes were wayyyyy too small.,22575,2
22575,They didn't past my upper leg.,22575,2
22576,It wasn't as pretty as the picture.,22576,2
22576,"When I got the product, the colors were somewhat dull and messy.",22576,2
22576,I had to return it.....,22576,2
22577,Too small.,22577,2
22578,My daughter broke them with 20 minutes!,22578,2
22579,This is not an extra large unless you mean an extra large girls size.,22579,2
22579,I checked the measurements of the item but there is no way it is as big as the measurements said.,22579,2
22580,The coat is too large specially at the bottom of it.,22580,2
22580,I expected  for slim shape (like the picture) and therefore i disappointed.,22580,2
22581,order a size bigger,22581,2
22582,The colors are a joke compared to the picture!,22582,2
22583,It's a great looking jacket but it feels like it's 2 sizes too small.,22583,2
22584,"It does fit as expected, but it looks too much like a custom... it doesn't look real.",22584,2
22584,:(,22584,2
22585,"very  crappy make do not fit on face or  protect your eyes from sun, feels like  slightly tinted blue when wearing waste of money",22585,2
22586,After having this dress altered in the chest area it fit better.,22586,2
22586,I'm large chested and there was some wiring in the seem that made the dress look bulky on top.,22586,2
22586,I tried to return it but wasn't worth the expense.,22586,2
22586,I'd have to pay for shipping back to China then only receive half or less of the cost for dress in return.,22586,2
22587,Very cute but the top is extremely small.,22587,2
22588,I love them but one light stays on and red won't shut off the other shoe works fine...,22588,2
22588,I hate dealing with returns I just won't buy them again waste of money they should test them first,22588,2
22589,The good: Excellent clip - wide and sturdy with no give - it keeps tension when I've got a lot or a little cash.,22589,2
22589,The BAD: Sermand felt the need to put a giant logo on the back side of the clip almost like it's YOUR monogram.,22589,2
22589,I did away with it using auto touch up paint but that's just unworthy.,22589,2
22590,I dislike it cause it says 3x but they are made form firing and made small so when you order one let's say if you are a medium you should order a large,22590,2
22591,When ordering make sure you add 2 to 3 sizes up from what you are.,22591,2
22591,More like a child's size,22591,2
22592,To have no snaps on bag,22592,2
22593,"I got two of these dresses and they're BEAUTIFUL but I had to return them :( I am 5'2"", 23 weeks pregnant and 150lbs and I ordered mediums b/c people were saying there wasn't a lot of room up top.",22593,2
22593,They ended up being way too small in the top and way too long on the bottom.,22593,2
22593,I was really disappointed since I was hoping to wear them to work but I'm short so I half expected them not to fit well.,22593,2
22593,"They are a nice jersey material, so if you are ok with cutting the bottom off they would still work.",22593,2
22593,I've done that with maxi dresses before if they material isn't the type to fray and it was fine.,22593,2
22593,But the top was still a problem so they had to go back.,22593,2
22594,Diamonds feel out,22594,2
22595,Meh.... Says it  runs small.,22595,2
22595,It's actually made for an obese dwarf.,22595,2
22595,Too lazy to return it so I guess I'll  just wear it when I want to feel bad about myself....,22595,2
22596,"I ended up with a fake, black leather Ray Ban case.",22596,2
22596,"Oddly enough, the cloth was real but the case itself is really cheaply made.",22596,2
22596,It works fine but it isn't what I expected or wanted.,22596,2
22597,"Im 5'1"" weigh 110lbs.",22597,2
22597,I ordered medium since i wasn't sure of the size.,22597,2
22597,"The item arrived on time, but it was a bit large for me.",22597,2
22597,I could have ordered the small size.,22597,2
22598,To small - sent it back,22598,2
22599,Not at all like the picture posted.,22599,2
22599,Must have a very small head to get this dress on.,22599,2
22599,"No zipper, nice beading",22599,2
22600,I am really sad cause they didn't fit at all even though I ordered a size bigger.,22600,2
22600,"They were small all the way around, very narrow!",22600,2
22601,"Too big.......I want to return it, but all I can find is give a review.",22601,2
22601,How do I return it please?,22601,2
22602,too small,22602,2
22603,decent quality but very large fit,22603,2
22604,i thought it would like too small might have to give to some body but it is a nice  ring nothing nothing wrong with it,22604,2
22605,"The shirt is beautiful, if you don't move.",22605,2
22605,"The way the stitching is done at the armpit basically makes it so that if you lift your arm at all, the whole torso of the shirt moves with it at an awkward angle.",22605,2
22606,Ordered a size bigger and the sleeves are still too small.,22606,2
22607,I ordered a 3x but it was to small.,22607,2
22607,Gave It to  my daughter who wears a 10/12 so no loss.,22607,2
22607,I am a 18/20  ordered a second one larger .will see what happens received 2nd dresses the same thing runs very very small.,22607,2
22608,Runs on Asian sizes.,22608,2
22608,Does not fit a typical American girl.,22608,2
22609,I love the design but for xl its not but will deal with,22609,2
22610,It looks like great material but I can't fit it,22610,2
22611,k,22611,2
22612,Broke in four days,22612,2
22613,"My 8 year old son wears these daily, but we have only had them for a few weeks and there is already a hole in the fabric of the sole.",22613,2
22613,I am very disappointed that the shoes cannot handle a little wear and tear.,22613,2
22613,He is very careful his shoes and has not been too rough in them.,22613,2
22613,Just a typical boy playing the way they do!,22613,2
22613,:),22613,2
22614,Size and Style is not as expected.,22614,2
22614,"It says One-size but it is actually fits Too large for a 5'-2"" / 115 lbs.",22614,2
22614,woman like me.,22614,2
22614,"The design print of the sheer fabric material is really nice and colors are vibrant, but there is a problem with the fit...it is too loose and does not fit well.",22614,2
22614,The wrap that I received was lopsided which was longer on one-side.,22614,2
22614,"The sewing quality was not good either, especially at the edges and the armhole location was not even.",22614,2
22615,"Material:cotton blend...  More BLEND then Cotton... ^^ like some cheap fleece

Ordered the first one.. (Color: Type XA).. seems like a Dark Blue and Orange.. its Grey and Curry(spice's) colour..
i ordred Large, im Medium..

All in all... seems like cheap materiel.. DONT think you can count on coulers when you order...
threads is sticking out all over..",22615,2
22616,Did not like this blouse at all.,22616,2
22616,Too thin and way too small.,22616,2
22616,It was a cheap buy and everything about this blouse was cheap.,22616,2
22617,A bit flimsy plus it's not got the black coloring to show the design.,22617,2
22617,Oh well.,22617,2
22617,"not worth sending back .It's a gift too , same Lady.",22617,2
22618,I sent this back.,22618,2
22618,The bust area was too large.,22618,2
22619,"Overall this bag is okay, decently well made and pretty color.",22619,2
22619,The straps are a little small tho for my liking I feel like the purse in shoved in my armpit.,22619,2
22619,Lol.,22619,2
22620,not that well made.,22620,2
22620,I don't like that type of clasp.,22620,2
22620,I wore the other bracelet that they sent with it.,22620,2
22620,When I got home from having it on I noticed that the charms were gone.,22620,2
22620,It was the first time I wore it.,22620,2
22621,Very cheaply made and one of the clasps/loops was defectively sewn so I could not even put the clasp in the loop.,22621,2
22621,It fit just fine but it looks very trashy.,22621,2
22621,"Its okay for your private pool, but people might look at you weird if you wear it in public.",22621,2
22621,I wanted to like it!,22621,2
22622,"This case fit on the watch well, however it had a clear plastic that cover the screen area that had surface scratches when it arrived.",22622,2
22622,I found another model without a screen cover which i currently use.,22622,2
22623,cute but waaaay too small and see through,22623,2
22624,low quality,22624,2
22625,"I bought the size 2-4 for my 3-year-old and i could barely get it around her feet, much less her calf.",22625,2
22625,I returned them for a 4-6 and hope they will fit larger without being too long.,22625,2
22626,"Does lift your butt however, it chokes the rest of your body.",22626,2
22626,Find one that won't squeeze your thighs to death.,22626,2
22627,"As many have previously posted, the top and the beading at the waist is NOT silver.",22627,2
22627,It is definitely blue.,22627,2
22627,"Not a grey/light blue, they're almost a royal blue, and the crystals are not in the same pattern as pictured.",22627,2
22627,"Luckily, my daughter likes the color and pattern anyway, so she's keeping it.",22627,2
22627,"Update:  The ""eyes"" for the hook and eye closure , completely ripped off the second time she put the dress on.",22627,2
22627,"We thought we were going to just sew them back on, but a seamstress friend said that there wasn't enough room, and that with the weight of the crystals, new eye closures probably wouldn't hold.",22627,2
22627,"Unfortunately , returning, but better than my daughter having a wardrobe malfunction at prom.",22627,2
22628,Nice but packaging needs to be bigger.,22628,2
22629,The color is cute and is as pictured but it's oversized for me.,22629,2
22629,"The side of the shirt doesn't fit to your body either, it flares outon the side and makes it look like a dress, which is awkward.",22629,2
22629,I guess I would suggest to order a size down.,22629,2
22630,"What was pictured and what I received are 2 different things....I didn't bother to send it back because they are both bathing suits, however I was expecting the one shown.",22630,2
22630,"I received a black one with polka dots....it's cute, but not what I ordered.",22630,2
22631,Fits nicely along the body but my boobs don't fit in it and I bought a size up than I normally wear.,22631,2
22632,Unfortunately this umbrella arrived with three small holes in the plastic.,22632,2
22632,"I liked the size (for my 5 year old), but decided to get a refund in stead of a replacement, fearing any others would rip easily.",22632,2
22632,The plastic was not as strong as I had hoped it would be.,22632,2
22633,The size is not accurate.,22633,2
22634,Gave 2 stars for a cute shirt but I ordered xl and it would fit MAYBE a 12 year old.,22634,2
22634,I'm sad.,22634,2
22634,Had to return.,22634,2
22635,It look so fack,22635,2
22636,Arrived as a wrinkled mess..size runs small and feels cheaply made - would not buy again,22636,2
22637,i like the dress but the breast area was super small and i even got it a little larger to give me room.,22637,2
22637,there is no room if you are larger than a B-cup.,22637,2
22637,it's too bad that i waited too long to send it back because now I'm stuck with it.,22637,2
22637,I'll see if I can give it to someone,22637,2
22638,"It's a lovely looking set, however I lost the bracelet within an hour of putting it on.",22638,2
22638,The loop was too big for the pearl that was to keep it in place.,22638,2
22638,The necklace stays on just fine.,22638,2
22639,Ordered a large and I'm a 5/6 DD bust top was way to loose at the bottom and the bottoms do not come up as high as the picture and a too sheer to wear in the sun or water.,22639,2
22640,Arrived a lot faster than estimated delivery date.,22640,2
22640,"The overall quality of the product is ok i guess, however; it didn't have a zip nor did it have buttons between the crouch to get into it.",22640,2
22640,Unfortunately my hips were too big to get into it.,22640,2
22640,"I am 5,6'', 140 pounds, normally wear a medium in just about everything.",22640,2
22640,"I ordered a large based off the reviews, but unfortunately the product still didn't fit.",22640,2
22641,Returned t..,22641,2
22642,This dress came for my daughter's birthday.,22642,2
22642,"first off the dress had deodorant stains on it, like it had been worn and returned and it was then sold to me.",22642,2
22642,the dress in the image looks like it comes a few inches above your knee.,22642,2
22642,the actual dress is much shorter.,22642,2
22642,it looks more like a top which you can wear over jeans or leggings.,22642,2
22642,the material also looks very different.,22642,2
22642,the only thing that looked consistent was the style of the off the shoulder sleeve with the white lace and the color.,22642,2
22642,it got 2 stars because it came on time,22642,2
22643,"Shipping was prompt, but the dress is a disappointment.",22643,2
22643,"While seemingly well constructed,  the fabric is cheap and thin to the point of being ridiculous.",22643,2
22643,I got the eggplant color and the fabric is sheer enough to be more like opaque hosiery.,22643,2
22643,"The skirt is nowhere near as full as it shows in the pictures, so be aware of that as well.",22643,2
22643,"I don't give it one star because the color and fit were as advertised, but that's about it.",22643,2
22643,"I'll keep it as lounge wear around the home, but doubt I'll wear in public.",22643,2
22644,If you have a B cup and up this suit will not work for you.,22644,2
22644,The cups on the suit are just too small.,22644,2
22644,I'm 5'5 140lbs and a B36 and it fits everywhere but the chest.,22644,2
22644,Cheaply made too but it is a really cute suit.,22644,2
22645,Fit does not feel right on me.,22645,2
22646,This was nice but broke 2x.,22646,2
22646,I finally threw it away,22646,2
22647,"Ordered cup size C/D, received cup size A.",22647,2
22647,Too late to return before prom.,22647,2
22648,What disappointed me about this item is the stones were clear.,22648,2
22648,They didn't have even a slight bit of a blue color to them.,22648,2
22648,More like white topaz.,22648,2
22648,Wouldn't recommend ordering.,22648,2
22649,"the straps around the bottom are tighter than the bottom of the bra, so it sits weirdly",22649,2
22650,too small,22650,2
22651,WAY too large!!!,22651,2
22651,fits very big!,22651,2
22651,missing the cufflinks and such.,22651,2
22651,Will be returning this.,22651,2
22652,"Fit finr but the quality not very good, look cheap",22652,2
22653,I needed these for my baby who had outgrown the newborn mitts hat never stayed on.,22653,2
22653,These are soft and pretty but at too large for our6 month old baby.,22653,2
22653,"They easily slip off and if I make the Velcro all the way tight the strap sticks out to poke her eye, lose lose.",22653,2
22654,"Disappointed, does not look like pic",22654,2
22655,my 8 year old fit it better then me and I am super skinny too.,22655,2
22655,Pulls to tight around the shoulder .,22655,2
22655,other then that its cute.,22655,2
22655,it just hurts to wear.,22655,2
22655,"I guess you need to buy two sizes up maybe, for it to fit.",22655,2
22656,This thing arrived today and has threads coming out of it and has an aweful smell.,22656,2
22656,I'll deal with it because I need something like this.,22656,2
22656,The item itself is super cute and I love the concept because my daughter has really big hair.,22656,2
22657,waaay too small!,22657,2
22657,"I have a small head, in it doesn't even begin to fit.",22657,2
22657,gave it to my 4yo.,22657,2
22658,The darned thing is crooked.,22658,2
22658,The dents in the top of the hat don't line up straight with the curve of the brim.,22658,2
22658,"It makes it look like the brim is cocked to one side if the top is on your head straight, and makes the top look cocked to the other side if the brim is lined up straight on your face.",22658,2
22658,"Reminds me of a pickup truck with a bent frame, where itappeares to be headed down the road at a slight angle different to the direction if travel of the wheels.",22658,2
22658,"I got it for working in the garden, so I am keeping it, but it is too goofy to wear out of the house.",22658,2
22659,"runs very small, had to return",22659,2
22660,I really wanted to like this top after reading such positive reviews.,22660,2
22660,The product listing is actually for four different dresses and most of the reviews are for a style I didn't purchase.,22660,2
22660,"I'd previously ordered one style of dress and, although I liked the color and the length of that dress, it was too small.",22660,2
22660,Their sizing chart is way off.,22660,2
22660,"I thought I'd try a second time, ordering a different style variation, being sure to order one size up.",22660,2
22660,This review is for the dress with the shark bite hem and was my second failed attempt.,22660,2
22660,I thought I'd figured out the sizing and ordered one size up this time.,22660,2
22660,It still fit exactly the same as the smaller size I'd ordered previously.,22660,2
22660,"I wouldn't call the shark bite hem top a dress, either, because it BARELY covers my crotch and I am 5'3''.",22660,2
22660,The top is also semi-see through.,22660,2
22660,I could clearly see the patterned leggings I was wearing through it.,22660,2
22660,It also shows every topographical variation of your body and bra.,22660,2
22660,"It's not forgiving of any imperfection, bump, elastic bra band, or slightest bulge you might have.",22660,2
22660,I wish I could see in my purchases what the positive reviewers attest to seeing in their's :(,22660,2
22661,"This top is pretty in the picture and a very pretty idea, but in practice it fell a little flat.",22661,2
22661,"I generally order a medium (I'm 5""8 and about 145lbs with a 38C-D bust) in most tops, and the reviews suggested that this item fit fairly true to size.",22661,2
22661,It fits.. sort of..,22661,2
22661,It felt really baggy on me and wasn't particularly flattering like I had hoped.,22661,2
22661,"In the image, it shows kind of a slimmer fit just under the bustline and then a flair out down by the hips, but when I tried it on tonight (4-1-16) it felt baggy everywhere, no fitted shaping anywhere :/ Might work far a gal without curves, but not really my fit unfortunately.",22661,2
22662,I ordered the large.,22662,2
22662,My niece was the only one that could wear it.,22662,2
22662,She's a size 0,22662,2
22663,3xl was more like an xl.,22663,2
22663,I returned it.,22663,2
22663,I'm 5'5 and 180lbs.,22663,2
22663,It's cute just didn't fit,22663,2
22664,Crushes easily.,22664,2
22664,Definitely don't keep it in your back pocket.,22664,2
22664,You'd be better off getting a leather RFID wallet.,22664,2
22665,This necklace looks pretty in the picture but no idea what it looks like in person since I never got it!!!,22665,2
22665,And the seller has never answered me back about it.,22665,2
22665,Its sad that Iwwasted my money,22665,2
22666,"Although very cute in the front, the back is very thin fabric.",22666,2
22666,"Even when dry, it shows too much!",22666,2
22666,Haven't worn it out & certainly not in public.,22666,2
22666,"Disappointed because it does fit nicely otherwise, very flattering.",22666,2
22667,"I really did not expect much from this necklace as it was a cheap necklace, but the pictures looked nice on here so I figured I would give it a chance.",22667,2
22667,"It was fairly slow shipping, and once it finally arrived I have to say I was disappointed.",22667,2
22667,"The ""turquoise"" did not look even anything like a real one.",22667,2
22667,I could tell it was fake without much inspection.,22667,2
22667,The chain looked very cheap and not well made also.,22667,2
22667,"Again, I know not to expect much given the price, but it was much nicer in the pictures!",22667,2
22668,These  stockings are very large.,22668,2
22668,I have smaller legs so for me they did not fit properly.,22668,2
22668,I was rather disappointed in the fit.,22668,2
22669,ITS CUTE NEVER TURNED JUST WISH IT WAS A LIL THICKER BIGGER IT FADED QUICKLEY :(,22669,2
22670,"The bottoms fit as expected but the top is just a long piece of see-through material, i ordered a medium & the material for the top is not long enough to wrap around enough & tie without my top 1/2 popping out.",22670,2
22670,I think its a cool idea that you can make the top different styles but the material is so cheap that i am going to have to go to a fabric store & get a longer piece of matierial in a much higher quality so you can't see through it,22670,2
22671,Everything came as it should except for one thing.... the fur is NOT the same color as shown in the picture !,22671,2
22671,!,22671,2
22671,!it's supposed to be more tan when it actually came in a ugly dark brown.,22671,2
22671,Not very pretty !,22671,2
22671,On a positive note the package came a lot earlier than expected.,22671,2
22672,Looks so cheap.,22672,2
22672,I'm returning it.,22672,2
22672,Fit awkwardly.,22672,2
22672,"Not cute at all, the pattern is not the same as in the photo.",22672,2
22672,Also the little flutter sleeves are not fluttery but thin and awkward.,22672,2
22672,HORRID.,22672,2
22673,This sweater is good quality but it runs really small.,22673,2
22673,I would recommend going up two sizes!,22673,2
22673,I had to return.,22673,2
22674,Hard to breastfeed in this bra.,22674,2
22675,"Ring was ok, was not true to size and didn't look quite like the picture",22675,2
22676,rather tinny.,22676,2
22676,area around stone a disappointment.,22676,2
22677,It was great until it broke 3 weeks later.,22677,2
22678,Looks cheap & feels cheap.,22678,2

22681,Not much stretch either.,22681,2
22682,Runs a little small,22682,2
22683,"Fit was somewhat small, but overall was good quality.",22683,2
22683,I did not like that it was so short in length.,22683,2
22684,Way too small.,22684,2
22684,I would suggest ordering 2 or 3 sizes up.,22684,2
22685,"They hurt my feet, i had to return them.",22685,2
22686,It really didn't care for the color.,22686,2
22686,It didn't look purple.,22686,2
22686,It looked blue.,22686,2
22686,It was a little small for my liking.,22686,2
22687,They are very pretty but a lot smaller than expected.,22687,2
22687,I was also concerned that they seemed very delicate.,22687,2
22688,"The product looks very pretty, but the quality needs to be improved",22688,2
22689,"Sized incorrectly, too long and too big in most areas.",22689,2

22691,"I was expecting for the shirt to be off the shoulder, as pictured.",22691,2
22691,"The shirt I received had a crew neck collar, and the stitching was torn around it.",22691,2
22691,"Also, not really ""oversized"" as described.",22691,2
22691,Disappointed.,22691,2
22692,This shirt is adorable except for the rip on it when i opened the pa package so it can't be worn... but still super cute,22692,2
22693,I wear a 10 or 12 and ordered the XXL based on the reviews I read and this was too small for me.,22693,2
22693,I will need to return it.,22693,2
22693,The material is also so think that I don't see how this could be worn for anything other than a beach/pool cover up.,22693,2
22694,"It's okay, but it's too big for me.",22694,2
22694,It's also not very sticky!,22694,2
22695,Much smaller than I wanted.,22695,2
22695,The stones are nice though.,22695,2
22695,Nice to give as a gift.,22695,2
22696,The material is not flexible and the seams rip very easily with normal wear.,22696,2
22696,Mine ripped completely down the left side within the first 2 weeks.,22696,2
22696,"Cool design, but not made to be worn.",22696,2
22697,"From the picture it looks like navy, but sadly it is more a royal blue.",22697,2
22697,I have returned this product',22697,2
22698,It is not terribly ugly.,22698,2
22698,But it looks too obviously inexpensive.,22698,2
22698,Flows well but not for me.,22698,2
22699,Button fell off after 2 days,22699,2
22700,Ordered this romper expecting it to be wearable  when I bought it but it is not made of an opaque material and I need something else to wear under it.,22700,2
22701,runs small,22701,2
22702,Looks can be deceiving.,22702,2
22702,"I did not realize, the necklace did not show any brown.",22702,2
22702,It is only black and white.,22702,2
22702,"Also, one of the pieces on the necklace fell out before I had a chance to wear it.",22702,2
22702,I used Elmer's glue and fixed it.,22702,2
22703,sorry have to return it.,22703,2
22703,"i suspect this may work for those who are tall and skinny, but that's not me.",22703,2
22704,Easily breaks.,22704,2

22708,Very Flimsy.,22708,2
22708,Bigger than expected.,22708,2
22708,Not for small waisted ladies.,22708,2
22708,Ripped as soon as I put it on and both the top and bottom.,22708,2
22709,Ugly,22709,2
22710,It doesn't look like the phone that is advertised.,22710,2
22711,Really can only let them hang down.,22711,2
22711,Very hard to make them stay in this position,22711,2

22714,"The upper leg, that is at the top of the thigh, just before it goes onto the lower body/panty area, doesn't transition smoothly.",22714,2
22714,"It cuts into the top of the thigh, giving a look and feel of panties that are cut too narrow for your legs.",22714,2
22714,"If not for this, they would be perfect.",22714,2
22715,No stretch.,22715,2
22716,"The advertise says that may run a little small I order medium my regular size , and for my surprise is too big",22716,2
22717,This is a piece of trash and stopped working the first month I got it.,22717,2
22717,I bought it for clinical because it could be easily wiped down with an alcohol swab.,22717,2
22717,It served that purpose and quickly died with no revival.,22717,2
22718,"Too big up top, too small on bottom.",22718,2
22719,Fits but had a tear in the seam.,22719,2

22728,Will wait for my middle daughter to grow into it.,22728,2
22729,ordered large.,22729,2
22729,recommend two sizes larger than intended size.,22729,2
22730,The making of this wallet  was sloppy.,22730,2
22730,There is glue on the lining of the wallet.,22730,2
22730,I had to use cuticle Cutters to clean it up.,22730,2
22730,The wallet was very stiff I could barely get my cards in it.,22730,2
22730,I Had It 2 weeks now and I still can't put my ID in it because it won't come out.,22730,2
22731,"They look good for a few seconds, with a lot of adjusting.",22731,2
22731,"But they ride down very quickly, tear easily, and run too small.",22731,2
22732,WHAT IS THIS?,22732,2
22732,A DRESS FOR ANTS?,22732,2
22732,?,22732,2
22733,"I thought I was getting a Concealed carry purse as the name said, so not happy it is only a billfold.",22733,2
22733,I guess I could conceal a small knife in it.,22733,2
22734,"IT LOOKS PRETTY ON THE PICTURE BUT IN REAL LIFE ONCE U HAVE IT, IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP BUT NICE IF ITS FOR A LITTLE GIRL WHO WONT CARE.",22734,2
22735,Very nice quality but way too small,22735,2
22736,horrible the top part fits super loose and the waist is just a tiny strip of elastic that makes me look and feel horrible.,22736,2
22737,"Not bad for the price, but looks cheap",22737,2
22738,"Stockings are super sexy but, did not fit the wife around the hips....too tight, unfortunately.",22738,2
22738,I've got to find her another brand/maker....any recommendations?,22738,2
22739,Pretty disappointed in this item it's much smaller than the discription and images lead me to believe.,22739,2
22739,Will be returning.,22739,2
22739,"Also for anyone looking to figure out how to put it together you take the spare strap they give you and feed it through the shoulder ""o"" rings then cross it over your chest ending with securing it behind your beck to create the pentagram design.",22739,2
22740,Not impressed,22740,2
22741,"The top is like armor with weird cups for a much smaller size, although the dress itself still looks like the picture.",22741,2
22741,"The color I ordered was charcoal, but the color I received is more of a plum/brown color.",22741,2
22741,And that is after I got an email from the manufacturer asking what color charcoal is and clarifying dark grey.,22741,2
22742,"The thin leather, if it really is leather, has peeled away from the backing.",22742,2
22742,Terrible quality.,22742,2
22742,"I'm buying vintage belts exclusively from now on, since every new belt I buy is so crappy.",22742,2
22743,"Again, in women's sizes but cut more for junior",22743,2
22744,"Nice sports hoodie, but to small",22744,2
22745,"The fabric smells, it has static and it fits really small.",22745,2
22745,I purchased and XL and it fits like a Medium.,22745,2
22745,I do not recommend to purchase this product.,22745,2
22745,I returned this blouse and had to pay for the postage return.,22745,2
22746,The blu color is already coming off of the sunglasses...it's been less than 2 months...very low quality,22746,2
22747,My daughter open this today for Christmas and it was too small.,22747,2
22747,So sad the return window has closed and we can't exchange the brand new shirt for a larger size.,22747,2
22747,This was her favorite gift too.,22747,2
22747,Guess it doesn't pay to shop early on Amazon.,22747,2
22747,Very sad!!,22747,2
22747,!,22747,2
22748,"I'm not sure who makes up these sizes, but I would say that if you are bigger than a size 14 don't bother with this.",22748,2
22748,It looks fine and for what I paid for it I can't complain about the look of it.,22748,2
22748,"I doubt I'd be able to wear it more than a couple of times though, so this is more for costume than wardrobe.",22748,2
22749,Very cheap and plastic.,22749,2
22749,Not at all what it looks like in the picture,22749,2
22750,"This dress should be very beautiful, but it is not.",22750,2
22750,It IS a beautiful color.,22750,2
22750,But...It's just not very flattering.,22750,2
22750,I can't quiet put my finger on it; it is strangely constructed--the loops for the belt are too high and the lapels are too large and I guess that the two sides are uneven.,22750,2
22750,I think the waist is too short.,22750,2
22750,"I have cut and pinned and done what I can with it, but I would not buy it again.",22750,2
22751,"very small, poor quality, poor stitching, do not recommend it .",22751,2
22752,The material of the dress looks and reminds me of a witches Halloween costume......,22752,2
22753,"Good quality but no way was that a true ""junior XL"" size.",22753,2
22753,I had to give it away.,22753,2
22753,Waste of money,22753,2
22754,nope,22754,2
22755,"I ordered an XXL, and I'm 5'5"" at 175lbs and this barely fits over by bust (36DD), even then it's WAY too short to be a ""dress""- maybe a long flowy shirt.",22755,2
22755,I'll just have to wear it with shorts/leggings.,22755,2
22756,I have 35 inch hips.,22756,2
22756,It is too big.,22756,2
22756,Have to find a gold key ring to see if I can adjust it.,22756,2
22756,"It might look great on a full figured person, or someone with very wide hips.",22756,2
22756,Should of been designed to have more adjustments for proper fit.,22756,2
22757,"I normally wear a medium, but it fit like small so I ordered large which fits snug.",22757,2
22757,"Cute dress, but made in China and not American size.",22757,2
22758,I ordered a large usually a large fits me with a little room but this was not a large it was a medium.,22758,2
22759,These are very tiny No.,22759,2
22759,1.,22759,2
22759,No.,22759,2
22759,2 When I tried to put the back on the earing the stem of the earing bended.,22759,2
22759,Dissatisfied customer.,22759,2
22760,"Material too thin, can only wear as pajama top.",22760,2
22760,Material too thin and wrinkles terribly.,22760,2
22761,I was very disappointed in this dress.,22761,2
22761,"It looks cute online, but the top was HUGE.",22761,2
22761,"I'm 5'5"" and 125lbs and have a 34"" bust, and I had about 6 inches of extra fabric around my bust area.",22761,2
22761,The fit was just not flattering.,22761,2
22761,I had to return it.,22761,2
22761,"It's too bad, too, because I loved the color.",22761,2
22762,"The color was beautiful and the material was soft, but construction and fit weren't great.",22762,2
22762,"The ""lace"" at the bottom is so stiff that it stands out like a hoop skirt rather than draping naturally (NOT flattering at all).",22762,2
22762,And the front is pretty short...be careful that your pants don't ride too low unless you want to show your midriff.,22762,2
22763,Loved how it looked.,22763,2
22763,I used it for 7 weeks and it started to fall apart.,22763,2
22763,Zippers failed - shoulder strap link broke.,22763,2
22764,"I wear a very small medium, but this was too small for me.",22764,2
22764,The material feels very cheap and thin.,22764,2
22764,"I requested a return, and recieved a response that was unintelligible.",22764,2
22764,"There's obviously a language barrier involved, but if you're doing business on Amazon, maybe invest in a capable English translator?",22764,2
22764,My return is currently being disputed.,22764,2
22764,Buy at your own risk.,22764,2
22765,This top is honestly really tiny.,22765,2
22765,"I'm a 32DD and this looked like a joke on me, it barely covered my nips and was super unflattering.",22765,2
22765,I would not recommend if you have boobs to cover.,22765,2
22765,"It's a cute top, just won't do the job for me.",22765,2
22766,Small for me,22766,2
22767,Come on guys ..these  are WAY too tight and are especially too small in the back.,22767,2
22768,Only reason why it's getting 2 stars is that the elastic broke after only 2 uses.,22768,2
22768,Unfortunately can't pull elastic forward to tie it off.,22768,2
22769,Size is small,22769,2
22770,Pretty but way too small,22770,2
22771,This was BRIGHT pink - neon really.,22771,2
22771,I felt like it was too Barbie's color for me.,22771,2
22771,My 3 year old loved it.,22771,2
22771,The style was frumpy and unflattering.,22771,2
22771,I like the fringe on the edges but that was it.,22771,2
22771,I knew I'd probably never wear it so was returned.,22771,2
22772,I didn't think it fit very well.,22772,2
22772,It was big up top and too tight around my thighs.,22772,2

22773,"as i own nothing but 2 pieces, i really wanted to get a super cute one piece for a trip to the Dominican republic.",22773,2
22773,"this lovely suit, material was good also but torso was too short on me.",22773,2
22773,"as i pulled it up to cover my boobs the suit became uncomfortable & the chest area was so oddly shaped it flatted my boobs, was not a good look at all on me.",22773,2
22773,I'm returning it.,22773,2
22774,Nice design.,22774,2
22775,I ordered it two sizes bigger than i usually wear & it's still to small so be careful with sizing....also it's not the dress in the picture once showed but it isn't bad either very plain but cute & flows perfect very light weight .....if you luck up & get the right size it will be so cute to wear,22775,2
22776,RUNS SMALL,22776,2

22783,If you have hips this is not the shirt for you,22783,2
22784,Very tight and uncomfortable.,22784,2
22784,Pouch is too small.,22784,2
22785,I purchased as a mother's ring prong stick out a little bit and snag close but overall very nice looking ring.....updated.,22785,2
22785,Stones fell out!,22785,2
22786,cheap as ever,22786,2
22787,These r very cute in the pic.,22787,2
22787,"But when they arrived, they did not look quite as expected.",22787,2
22787,It shows a two tone in the picture.,22787,2
22787,I got ones that were just one color.,22787,2
22787,Disappeared.,22787,2
22787,And I have found that breckelles tend to run a little on the small side.,22787,2
22787,So order a half sz larger or maybe even a whole sz.,22787,2
22788,Very cheap materiel.,22788,2
22788,I had to steam the dress to get the wrinkles out and it discolored.,22788,2
22788,"See-thorough materiel from top to bottom, you literally can't wear any under garments with it.",22788,2
22788,Its super thin.,22788,2
22788,"If you like this and want it- Like its perfect for one night out, (especially if your event is in the dark like my gala was) but make sure you have a floir length slip to wear underneath!",22788,2
22788,The pictures are misleading.,22788,2
22788,Don't regret my purchase but wouldn't recommend it!,22788,2
22789,I ordered these for my adult daughter who loves ankle socks.,22789,2
22789,"Deliver took longer than expected, but we were patient.",22789,2
22789,She put on a pair tonight and said they were too small and slip off of her heel.,22789,2
22789,They will definitely slip off if worn with shoes.,22789,2
22789,She said she'll wear them around the house though if her feet are too cold.,22789,2
22789,"Definitely runs small, so keep that mind.",22789,2
22790,These are just too big or something.,22790,2
22790,"They look fake no matter where I put them -ear, cartilage, nose, lip.",22790,2
22790,"The opening is big enough that you can get them just about anywhere, but they don't look right.",22790,2
22790,I will probably never use them.,22790,2
22791,This fit as expected but the material was cheap and very thin.,22791,2
22791,It wasn't a nice feel.,22791,2
22791,I just sent mine back.,22791,2
22792,The fabric dosent look likw what will arrive honestly i wasn't trying to buy a cardigan are jacket over 20 dollars but now looking at the quality i should have but since its here ill work with it,22792,2
22793,"I love this design and hope my infant grows into it, but I searched for 9 month old hats and this is not right for my son.",22793,2
22794,The dress had a very strong smell of factory.,22794,2
22794,A bunch of the buttons were not sewed on right.,22794,2
22794,I believe it to be a very beautiful dress but the torso fabric reminds me of a table cloth.,22794,2
22795,mine came with out a latch.,22795,2
22795,other than that its great.,22795,2
22796,material is flimsy,22796,2
22797,This is actually a women's small shirt,22797,2
22798,Way Smaller than advertised.,22798,2
22798,Didn't fit.,22798,2
22798,Looked nice though,22798,2
22799,I have small wrists (a bit under 6 inches) and this bracelet as it's tightest is 7 inches.,22799,2
22799,"I'm a bit disappointed in the style of the bracelet, too.",22799,2
22799,The braided strands are longer than others.,22799,2
22799,"Maybe this isn't an issue if it fits, but it doesn't look good when it's too big on you.",22799,2
22800,"Not very happy to say the truth, the dress is two different colors, brick red up top and orange below.",22800,2
22800,"I was expecting a better quality fabric too, but it fits good and feels comfortable",22800,2
22801,"Belt was good for a month, then the cheap coating came off and I'm walking around with a grey patch in the belt.",22801,2
22801,Would not recommend,22801,2
22802,Very disappointed since the descriptions says this is 100% cotton but the one I ordered in purple is 95% rayon and the rest spandex.,22802,2
22802,The sweater is pretty and well made.,22802,2
22802,Fits well but I really prefer cotton clothing and that is the primary reason I purchased the item.,22802,2
22803,overwhelming chemical smell.,22803,2
22803,Had to return.,22803,2
22804,It looks very cheap,22804,2
22805,wrong color but close enough.... also i like these frames because i thought that the arms popped off and on easily.. these are knock offs so they're screwed on /:,22805,2
22806,Kind of boxy,22806,2
22807,Cheap material.,22807,2
22807,And order your actual size.,22807,2
22807,It looks baggy on me.,22807,2
22807,Pockets are small and useless.,22807,2
22807,And the breast pocket isn't even a pocket.,22807,2
22807,The hood would cover a child's head fine but a adult it looks like a yakima.,22807,2
22808,big and short,22808,2
22809,The arms are very tight.,22809,2
22809,The rest fit fine.,22809,2
22810,My husband is a big guy and wears these kind of shirts for work.,22810,2
22810,I ordered the 3XLT and it didn't begin to fit.,22810,2
22810,It was so small that I wasn't sure if even a 5x would have fit right.,22810,2
22810,"The material is quite light weight, certainly not sturdy enough for a work shirt.",22810,2
22810,"On the positive side, well, I ordered red and it was a true red color.",22810,2
22810,Returned and shopping elsewhere.,22810,2
22811,It's a poor iron on!,22811,2
22812,"This is clearly not a ""official"" school sweatshirt but a knockoff.",22812,2
22812,The package came from China.,22812,2
22812,"The quality is, mediocre--after one washing there's threads coming undone.",22812,2
22812,This will be fine for bumming around in but it's not what I expected for quality.,22812,2
22813,"Definitely not the same sweatshirt pictured, colors are bright and bold.",22813,2
22813,"Comfy, but looks cheaply made.",22813,2
22813,"Probably wouldn't have bought it knowing this, but I'll still wear it.",22813,2
22814,I really liked these pants when I first for them.,22814,2
22814,"But as time went on the stitching made me itch, and the waist for super loose, also has a weirdly large crotch are.",22814,2
22814,Rent to slide off of me.,22814,2
22814,Plus they had a lot more distressed areas then pictured and look kind of junky.,22814,2
22814,"They are soft and stretchy, and I can sew so I will probably take I.",22814,2
22814,The waist.,22814,2
22815,Print is very cute.,22815,2
22815,Strap broke first time I used it.,22815,2
22815,Clip broke off now it's pointless,22815,2
22816,Broke the very first time I put it on.,22816,2
22816,The straps are awkward and it's made very poorly.,22816,2
22816,It's unfortunate because it is very cute!,22816,2
22817,I needed a Tuxedo shirt for event and this one seemed to be well reviewed.,22817,2
22817,Material feels fine but the shirt was covered in strings/frayed upon taking out of the package.,22817,2
22817,"Additionally, the button on the collar came off the first time I tried the shirt on.",22817,2
22817,Will now have to replace the button.,22817,2
22817,Would recommend buying a different shirt if you're not willing to repair/tailor this one.,22817,2
22818,"I purchased a 3XL, thinking that it would fit my 5'10"", XL frame.",22818,2
22818,I was incorrect.,22818,2
22818,"It was way too small, and I could not even get it onto my arms.",22818,2
22818,"Even if it had fit around me, it still would have been too short for my torso.",22818,2
22819,It was a little small on the bottom half.,22819,2
22820,The fabric is soft and it is a pretty color.,22820,2
22820,That's about all I can say that's positive about this shirt.,22820,2
22820,It is not a quality garment.,22820,2
22820,It's nothing like the picture.,22820,2
22820,I normally wear a medium or large and I ordered a double x and it still does not come as low as they show it in the picture.,22820,2
22820,The picture shows it covering her behind this barely makes it to my hips or Beltline.,22820,2
22820,Waste of money.,22820,2
22820,A teen girl would probably like it pretty well,22820,2
22821,The beads do not match the picture that is posted.,22821,2
22821,I also believe they are designed for someone with very thin wrists.,22821,2
22821,"Other than that, they are pretty.",22821,2
22822,Does not fit like the picture.,22822,2
22822,It's made for someone with a very short torso and does not fit curves.,22822,2
22822,Had to re sew it to sinch in the waist to give some shape.,22822,2
22822,The material is not soft nor does it stretch.,22822,2
22822,The real one that the model is wearing is actually grey and from urban outfitters.,22822,2
22823,popped after 3 days.,22823,2
22823,my daughter was pissed.,22823,2
22823,she really liked the bracelet.,22823,2
22824,"definitely not as pictured, it does not come down as far as shown but only to the waist",22824,2
22825,Ran small and the zipper was poor quality.,22825,2
22826,"Pros:
-Cool looking attack on titan bookbag.",22826,2
22826,-Small and lightweight.,22826,2
22826,"**************************************************
Cons:
-Zipper broke right after opening for the first time.",22826,2
22826,Zipper seems to easily break so be careful.,22826,2
22826,"Luckily there are two zippers...
-Very flimsy.",22826,2
22826,I try not to put too much in it for fear of it ripping.,22826,2
22826,-The pouches on the side for water bottles were too small for a normal sized water bottle.,22826,2
22826,"Go figure

Overall: Very cheaply made of course, but more than that....seems poorly designed.",22826,2
22826,"Get if you want to have something that looks cool, but don't buy for practical use.",22826,2
22827,The coloring of the dress was very pretty but other than that I found it to be very unflattering.,22827,2
22827,Was disappointed in the fit and material of the dress.,22827,2
22828,Not what I expected,22828,2
22829,I returned this item.,22829,2
22829,It did not fit me as I had hoped.,22829,2
22830,Very short fit.,22830,2
22830,Not for tall women.,22830,2
22830,No breast support either.,22830,2
22831,"Poor instructions, this item never worked after 1 successful attatchment of button.",22831,2
22831,I went to you tube and it was no help.,22831,2
22831,There was video that was too fast.,22831,2
22832,To small,22832,2
22833,Ordered a size LARGE.,22833,2
22833,"Received shipment and it was way too small, it was obvious that the see was mislabeled!",22833,2
22834,"Very cool dress, but you cant wear it as a dress unless you like ur ass hanging out.",22834,2
22834,Looks cool with legging and a pair of boots!,22834,2
22835,Bracelet is very small.,22835,2
22835,It fits me but I have small wrists.,22835,2
22835,This product is just ok.,22835,2
22835,The groove isn't deep enough to keep a hair band on.,22835,2
22836,This dress was ill fitting on me.,22836,2
22836,I think it would look better on someone with a bigger belly.,22836,2
22837,"Pretty,but not made well.",22837,2
22837,All of the rinestones on the sides fell out a week after wearing it.,22837,2
22838,I take 2xl is one size more big of my regular and these items is chort,22838,2
22839,Awful,22839,2
22840,"This bag was much smaller than we thought, and the zipper arrived ripped out.",22840,2
22840,We sent it back.,22840,2
22841,Sadly I will have to return these gloves because my arms are not shaped like rectangles and my pinky fingers are not as long as my middle finger.,22841,2
22841,"The gloves are loose and only go a couple inches past my elbow, unlike in the picture.",22841,2
22842,See through.,22842,2
22843,It's not as pictured.,22843,2
22843,Instead of being a long loose shirt it's actually a very fitted shirt.,22843,2
22844,Looks cheap.,22844,2
22845,"Get a size bigger than your original size, TRUST me.",22845,2
22846,not original and made n china,22846,2
22847,"Unlike other products similar to this, the ""notch"" isn't very deep and my girlfriend keeps experiencing her headband coming off the jewelry",22847,2
22848,It is not as long as expected and the pearls are spaced too far apart.,22848,2
22848,Tying the knot like it is  suppose to be worn is not going to work.,22848,2
22849,"The top of this dress was so small, and the pre-molded breast cups were placed too close together.",22849,2
22849,It is too bad.,22849,2
22849,I otherwise would have liked this dress.,22849,2
22850,"This shirt was way to long, I returned it.",22850,2
22851,Don't believe the picture.,22851,2
22851,More black and muddy than blue and gray.,22851,2
22851,No structure at all.,22851,2
22851,Made of jersey fabric.,22851,2
22852,Wasn't what I expected.,22852,2
22853,not a one size fits all - like a kids doo rag,22853,2
22854,Very short.,22854,2
22854,"I am 5'8"" and it comes way above my ankles.",22854,2
22855,I was hopeful that these would look better on and what fit to size per the sizing guide.,22855,2
22855,"They are still small but I think they will do, too much of a pain to send back.",22855,2
22855,If you are going to order these I would say to go up 2 sizes if you wear a large.,22855,2
22856,The details say this is a sweater.,22856,2
22856,"I'm very disappointed that this is not a sweater, it is simply a cotton shirt.",22856,2
22856,I would not have paid this price for a shirt.,22856,2
22856,Not as advertised.....!!!,22856,2
22856,!,22856,2
22857,Don't believe size for plus women.,22857,2
22857,If you're a tiny person might fit.,22857,2
22857,Quality seemed good.,22857,2
22858,Its very form fitting and way too tight on me,22858,2
22859,It's really pretty!,22859,2
22859,I am returning it though because I thought it was for a septum.,22859,2
22859,I couldn't even get it over the middle cartridge on my nose.,22859,2
22860,To small for my daughter,22860,2
22861,The fit was weird,22861,2
22862,Do not buy this with the expectation of wearing it for a dress.,22862,2
22862,The lining is very cheap and the seams are not well sown and you can see them.,22862,2
22862,It's not very flattering either.,22862,2
22862,It almost looks like the lining was sown in to it while it was inside out.,22862,2
22862,It will be a cute cover up but I don't it will last more than a few wears.,22862,2
22862,Shipping was fast.,22862,2
22862,"I ordered 2 of these and the other is still coming from China, but I'm expecting the same quality of dress- or lack of...",22862,2
22863,This product runs small for me.,22863,2
22863,Not real crazy about the gauze like material.,22863,2
22864,"I bought the 5x, but the shoulders are so small, it does not even fit my 1x/2x cousin.",22864,2
22864,"If you have small shoulders, and are a 1x/2x size, get the 5x.",22864,2
22865,It is not as pictured.,22865,2
22865,"The back is not cut to the low back, the cut stops at the shoulder.",22865,2
22865,And the quality is like somethings g I would pay$5 for in Rainbows.,22865,2
22865,Not worth the hassle of returning.,22865,2
22866,The XL fits like a medium,22866,2
22867,"The size is right, but as soon as i opened the package and unbuttoned them the button FLEW off.",22867,2
22867,"It was not stitched very well, and does not suit by butt whatsoever.",22867,2
22868,Too tight around the sleeves.,22868,2
22869,"The hook is huge and looks fake so, so I placed it around my review mirror.",22869,2
22870,"Not bad my girlfriend loves them but the one set she rly wanted only came with one and another of the previous set, 3 of the same kind",22870,2
22871,Way too big.,22871,2
22871,They would be perfect if they were smaller.,22871,2
22871,Can't wear them,22871,2
22872,Need to return.,22872,2
22872,The top does not fit will.,22872,2
22872,It does not lay flat on the sides.,22872,2
22872,Need to return this.,22872,2
22873,"The robe is nice, however the slippers got ruined the very first day.",22873,2
22873,the stitches opened and the slipper is not usable from day one.,22873,2
22874,Faded after a week,22874,2
22875,the denim shirt is amazing but it was somewhat larger that i expected i had to wash it a dry it to shrink it a little  also some of the buttons where missing when it arrived.,22875,2
22876,The printing on the top is faded and the material is very thin.,22876,2
22876,The bottoms were several sizes to small.,22876,2
22876,Not worth the purchase price in my opinion.,22876,2
22877,Cheaply put together but looks okay.,22877,2
22877,"Not what I was looking for, a tad big too.",22877,2
22878,Agree with other reviewers about opening being too small to fit over nipples.,22878,2
22878,I guess you could bend them open a bi tto make them fit but I didn't want to take the chance of breaking them & not being able to return them.,22878,2
22879,It turned my finger greenish black within a couple of weeks.,22879,2
22880,the strap on the left shoe was defective and detached from the shoe!,22880,2
22880,i guess they don't check the shoes before they send them.,22880,2
22880,smh,22880,2
22881,Unfortunately  size chart is for reg breast size doesn't account  for breastfeeding  size difference.,22881,2
22881,Order up,22881,2
22882,"Two stars, not one, because it looks good.",22882,2
22882,Be warned this item is really not made of high-quality materials.,22882,2
22882,My son used it four five times in a daycare.,22882,2
22882,The way this item ages is remarkable.,22882,2
22882,I used to buy another brand but I thought why not to try this one and now I regret it.,22882,2
22882,I was expecting this item to last for 3-4 months with light use.,22882,2
22882,"But after the first three weeks of use, it looks really bad.",22882,2
22882,I never had this problem with other comparable brands.,22882,2
22883,These glasses are really cheap in price and quality.,22883,2
22883,"The vendor shipped really quickly so I can't really blame them for me being a cheapskate, but I'd recommend others to spend a bit more for a similar product.",22883,2
22884,Ordered a medium seemed as if was more a large size,22884,2
22885,Need to returned it.,22885,2
22885,Extremely small.,22885,2
22885,Ordered my size but did not fit at all.,22885,2
22886,The blue top part and black stripes look funny together.,22886,2
22886,My fault.,22886,2
22886,I thought it would be solid blue if I picked the blue.,22886,2
22886,Thin shows everything underneath.,22886,2
22886,Arrived on time and good packaging.,22886,2
22887,"Ordered a larger size since reviews show its small, it still was tight, but the material is so cheap I can not be seen wearing this!",22887,2
22887,Waste of time and money!,22887,2
22888,"Poorly made, doesnt look like the picture",22888,2
22889,Cheap!,22889,2
22890,"Nice short, but waist size on 36"" is actually 38"" (measured with tape measure).",22890,2
22890,"I washed two pair hoping for shrinkage, but alas, the shorts did not shrink in the waist at all.",22890,2
22891,Not fit well disappointed,22891,2
22892,"I was kind of disappointed with these, but I really didn't read the description closely enough.",22892,2
22892,They are completely seamless and sort of look like pajama botttoms.,22892,2
22892,I was looking for something a little more substantial.,22892,2
22893,Quality not the best.,22893,2
22893,Very thin material.,22893,2
22893,"Thought this was a sweatsuit, but all it is is pajamas.",22893,2
22893,Misrepresented.,22893,2
22894,Two of the gems fell off after wearing the jewelry for less than an hour.,22894,2
22895,The material is VERY low quality which is a shame because the style is fun and sexy.,22895,2
22895,"At least it's black, I would not get this in any other color for sure.",22895,2
22896,The top was a bit large.,22896,2
22896,I wear a 32DD and the top was not really tight enough.,22896,2
22896,Plus it collects lint very easy.,22896,2
22897,The one with the all monkeys wasn't all the way sown there was a hole on the sides.,22897,2
22897,But the solid color was fine with no holes,22897,2
22898,Waaaaayyyyyy too small for my size 1 daughter!,22898,2
22899,Hat really bend up.,22899,2
22899,Box it came in was too small!,22899,2
22900,I received this broken,22900,2
22901,"Really liked the color
But they do not offer bigger sizes in this style shirt.. returned it.",22901,2
22902,"Tight, not stretchy at all.",22902,2
22902,And thin and short,22902,2
22903,"I am 5'1"" and 130 lbs.",22903,2
22903,These fit a bit odd.,22903,2
22903,The crouch seems to be low so I have to pull them up so I don't feel like they are falling down.,22903,2
22903,Then I get extra material bunching a little at the top of the leg.,22903,2
22903,"The material is textured like tights, so they are not as soft as normal leggings.",22903,2
22903,The charcoal color is almost black.,22903,2
22903,I am returning these due to the scratchy texture.,22903,2
22903,They are also warmer than standard unlined spring/fall leggings and they are dark winter colors.,22903,2
22904,This runs very small.,22904,2
22904,I usually order a large and its a little big.,22904,2
22904,This large was so small I thought it might be a children's large.,22904,2
22904,It will have to go back.,22904,2
22904,It is a nice looking shirt.,22904,2
22904,I would order it again if it comes in 1x or maybe larger.,22904,2
22905,Found the set to be on the small side for the size purchased.,22905,2
22905,Also I did not like the pattern and found it cheap looking.,22905,2
22906,"It is definitely cute but the fabric is so slippery, it just won't stay on my son's curly head.",22906,2
22907,15 yo daughter loved it  the seam from underneath blew out about 2 hours after wearing it  (she is a skinny girl)  i reinforced all the stiching  cute fabric design  but u get what u pay for,22907,2
22908,The plugs are very hard to twist together and aren't very comfortable.,22908,2
22908,Wished I wouldn't have purchased this product.,22908,2
22909,Item is much shorter than shown.,22909,2
22909,Could not wear,22909,2
22910,not a lot room for my butt.,22910,2
22910,"that feeling when you think you might be wearing your pants backwards but you're not, thats me every time I put them on",22910,2
22911,This is a really awkward dress.,22911,2
22911,"I thought that b/c it said that it tied that it was a wrap dress, but it's not- it has a single stitch cinching the two pieces of fabric together above the bust (almost to the neck) and it has an elastic band under the bust that was definitely not made with large chested ladies in mind- getting it over my chest was a very careful, awkward process.",22911,2
22911,"But, it was big everywhere else- like yards of fabric billowing around me.",22911,2
22911,"I am somewhat short (5'3""), but it was a good 8-10"" too long (without heels).",22911,2
22911,"It does come with a separate tie, but because the elastic is so high (empire waist), it would have looked strange.",22911,2
22911,It's going back.,22911,2
22912,These fit smaller than expected and the material wore out after one wear.,22912,2
22913,Pulled my boobs down and rode up my butt.,22913,2
22913,"Im 5'5, usually wear a medium but ordered a large",22913,2
22914,A lot shorter than it appears in the picture,22914,2
22915,Shipped quickly but poor packaging.,22915,2
22915,I ordered a 4x anticipating that it would run a little on the small side (for my 350lb+ boyfriend who usually wears 3x) but it is so tight on him that he can't even zip it.,22915,2
22915,Very disappointed.,22915,2
22916,Only 2 of the included extenders were useful.,22916,2
22916,Silver buttons with spring loop.,22916,2
22916,"Others: (6)White plastic button with loop, loop would not fit around the button without feeling like i was going to pull the button off of the shirt.",22916,2
22916,White elastic rectangles extended the collar too much for my liking.,22916,2
22916,White fabric long ovals good for a single use then the button came un-stitched from them.,22916,2
22916,Maybe some of them wold work better for you but i suggest just buying a quality pack of the type with the spring loop.,22916,2
22917,I ordered larger than normal and the shirt was still a little snug.,22917,2
22917,It shrunk with the first wash making it even smaller.,22917,2
22917,"I am 8 months pregnant right now, I should be able to fit in the shirt comfortable at some point after delivery, but not sure if the length will ever be long enough.",22917,2
22918,Found this bag to be cheaply made and much smaller than described; so it was returned.,22918,2
22919,Was way too small.,22919,2
22919,Ordered a ladies size.,22919,2
22919,What was sent had to be a kids size.,22919,2
22920,too small for my head...,22920,2
22920,I really don't think I have a large head,22920,2
22921,I've got to say that I was happy to receive my items when I first got them.,22921,2
22921,I ordered this infant aviator hat and the bumble bee infant knit and they seemed great at first glance.,22921,2
22921,But after looking back at my order I started noticing little things that bugged me.,22921,2
22921,We're getting ready for our newest addition to the family this August 2016 and being in the airline industry we want to have some cool aviation related pictures taken of our baby girl once she arrives.,22921,2
22921,"A few days after receiving this item it kept bugging me that I'd seen these knits elsewhere and then my wife chimed in and said ""yeah, they're on Etsy"".",22921,2
22921,The seller of these knits looks like they purchased a template that's for sale by another seller on that site and borrowed some of the pictures.,22921,2
22921,"The knit helmet runs a little big for an infant, although done very well as far as being soft and complete, the design doesn't quite match up with what you see in the images.",22921,2
22921,"One thing I liked was that the goggles looked deep due to the layering of the stitching between the red and grey rim for the goggles, but what I actually received looked less recreation and more cartoon like.",22921,2
22921,"If you look at the picture you'll notice the inner goggle is much smaller than what you expect to receive, which makes it look bug eyed.",22921,2
22921,"Like some other reviewers noted, it's just not what's pictured.",22921,2
22921,"For $7.00 I can't really complain, but those infant pictures are a one in a lifetime opportunity to get just the right image, and I don't want to be staring at a picture thinking how I should've just ordered the right one.",22921,2
22921,I would not have ordered these if I had seen the actual image of the items I would receive.,22921,2
22922,"I'm 40 yrs old 5'2"" and 120 and it doesn't really hide any mid-waist imperfections ;) I'm a size 5-6 in all other clothes so ordered the 4-6.",22922,2
22922,Perhaps the larger size would have fit better.,22922,2
22922,IMO - It'll look great and protect from the sun if you're skinny.,22922,2
22923,Polyester material.,22923,2
22923,Not cotton as description.,22923,2
22924,Neck of shirt fit however!!!!,22924,2
22924,The rest of the shirt was huge.,22924,2
22924,I ended up having to take up the entire shirt.,22924,2
22924,4 stars however for the tie & cummerbund and the quality of the material of the shirt.,22924,2
22925,Haven't seen any results,22925,2
22926,String broke the day i got the package :( the color is nice though.. too bad it's unwearable now,22926,2
22927,It doesn't hold it's shape.,22927,2
22927,I've tried the other brands and they're bit of better quality.,22927,2
22928,This skirt is beautiful but it is really small.,22928,2
22928,I would say it is between a 2-4.,22928,2
22929,"The top fit snug, but the shorts weren't proportioned to the top at all!!",22929,2
22929,The bottoms were about 4 sizes too small!,22929,2
22929,"(Thin material as well, making it a little see through).",22929,2
22930,The vest is made of nice quality material but is way smaller than expected.,22930,2
22930,I normally wear a large but purchased the XL anticipating it might run small.,22930,2
22930,I wasn't expecting it to be that small!,22930,2
22931,"Almost no stretch and the breathability is minimal, I cycle 6 miles every other day and they caused a lot of resistance.",22931,2
22932,The dress looks nothing like the picture!,22932,2
22932,It only has about half the stones and they're not nearly in the same pattern.,22932,2
22932,My daughter wears a size 6 after reading the reviews I decided to order a size 4.,22932,2
22932,It was still absolutely HUGE!,22932,2
22932,I had to buy a totally different dress for our event!,22932,2
22933,This suit has nothing to do with the fit they show in the photo.,22933,2
22933,I will try to upload a photo for other customers to see.,22933,2
22934,They say this is a dress.,22934,2
22934,Well I ordered the XL and there is no way I would go out of the house wearing this as a dress.,22934,2
22934,"Now as a shirt, it works fine.",22934,2
22934,"The colors are very nice, but I think a child would be the only one that could wear this as a dress.",22934,2
22935,The clothes is cheap.,22935,2
22935,The style is different than offered,22935,2
22936,Im normally a mens size XL.,22936,2
22936,"I ordered a ""size 3XL"" which must have been in womens, or they are tiny people that make the coats.",22936,2
22936,The size was not even close... No hassle on the return though.,22936,2
22937,"The cape is so tight around the neck it feels like it's meant for a child, and the bust part of the outfit is huge",22937,2
22938,I ordered 2 sizes bigger bc I knew that it was coming from China and they tend to run smaller.,22938,2
22938,It was still was too small.,22938,2
22938,I will no longer be ordering clothing that is shipping from china.,22938,2
22939,disappointed with this item.,22939,2
22939,"color was not a light mint color as ordered, it was certainly dull and darker than shown.",22939,2
22939,I ordered a size up and still cannot wear as a dress.,22939,2
22940,Not the quality I expected.,22940,2
22940,I'm not sure if fake or not.,22940,2
22940,I've never had havainas before but before this pair I  owned a Payless plastic flip flop that lasted more than 6 years.,22940,2
22940,Someone borrowed and never returned them so I tried Payless again but they don't have them anymore.,22940,2
22940,I started looking on amazon and came across this flip flops.,22940,2
22940,The soles are fine but the strap between my toe cuts my skin.,22940,2
22940,I'm keeping them in hopes that they'll get better with everyday wear.,22940,2
22941,"It was a bit larger than I anticipated, plus the CC spots were not ample",22941,2
22942,Would almost be the perfect knock off if it didn't cover my camera,22942,2
22943,This sweater is made out of cheap synthetic material.,22943,2
22943,The logo is great but I was hoping for a real sweater.,22943,2
22943,This would not keep you warm in winter.,22943,2
22943,Maybe good for fall/spring.,22943,2
22943,My SO hasn't even worn it once since I got it for her.,22943,2
22944,"The accent bow we received was not turquoise, rather it is a light pink color.",22944,2
22944,The skirt is not coral as depicted in the photo.,22944,2
22944,"It is more of a standard, pumpkin orange.",22944,2
22945,Had to order 2 pairs.,22945,2
22945,Lights are defective I believe.,22945,2
22945,Very nice shoes with but constantly have to play Mr.,22945,2
22945,Fix It!,22945,2
22946,Line of sight is highly obstructed.,22946,2
22946,"Not mean to be worn more than for a photo OPP, as it is difficult to see to do much in the mask.",22946,2
22947,cheap rings and one isn't the same size as the others so I couldn't even wear them all...,22947,2
22948,I returned it.,22948,2
22948,Fitting not good,22948,2
22949,was damage and dirty when i received.,22949,2
22950,Meh.,22950,2
22951,I purchased the 1x2x size.,22951,2
22951,I am 5'7' and 160 pounds.,22951,2
22951,and they are way too short.,22951,2
22951,I can't imagine imagine the fit if you were any taller or heavier.,22951,2
22951,"They would be a good fit at this size if I were 5'2"".",22951,2
22951,My toes are practically folded over to get them even close to my waist.,22951,2
22951,It took 3 tries working them up to get them where they are now.,22951,2
22951,I would return them if I hadn't tried them on.,22951,2
22951,They need to lengthen them at the factory.,22951,2
22951,I am assuming they all run short.,22951,2
22951,Buyer be ware.,22951,2
22951,I am terribly disappointed.,22951,2
22952,Not much compression and very see through.,22952,2
22953,I ordered according to my measurements and the top was still wayyyyy of,22953,2
22954,I'm 5'4 and 150 pounds and ordered a large.,22954,2
22954,Definitely not a fan.,22954,2
22954,It was made of very cheap material and the bottoms were too large in the butt and too snug at the waist.,22954,2
22954,I sent it back.,22954,2
22955,We did not receive the pictured prints or colors.,22955,2
22955,Very disappointed.,22955,2
22955,Sadly we need these for potty training so I won't be returning.,22955,2
22955,Buyer beware.,22955,2
22955,We received ugly orange and blue trainers.,22955,2
22956,It is way bigger than what I expected and colors are not as bright as shown in the picture.,22956,2
22957,"Good time, great fit, but I got it in a spandex material that was no where near the right color",22957,2
22958,The color is tooooooo brassy.....looks cheap,22958,2
22959,The bathing suit is very cute but cut extremely small.,22959,2
22959,"I ordered it a size up, as suggested in other reviews, and it made no difference.",22959,2
22960,XL wanted was very small and it seems S,22960,2
22961,Arrived totally tangled in a small bag.,22961,2
22961,Not work the postage to send it back.,22961,2
22961,I have worked on it several times and still have not managed to get it untangled.,22961,2
22961,"I wish I could have straightened it, my daughter would have loved it.",22961,2
22962,Fit is good.,22962,2
22962,I'm 5'5' 105 lbs.,22962,2
22962,Material is very lightweight nylon-type of material.,22962,2
22962,Print is blurry.,22962,2
22962,"I have purchased the inexpensive nylon sundresses from China, and I like them.",22962,2
22962,But I think this skirt looks pretty cheap.,22962,2
22963,The shirt was too tight around the neck.,22963,2
22963,I had to take it to be altered.,22963,2
22963,Cute outfit and a perfect compromise between my 8 yr old and I.,22963,2
22964,Birds are bigger than I expected and looked a little like something my mother would buy.,22964,2
22964,It is going back.,22964,2
22965,"I got the ""gray"" leggings, and they aren't a true gray they are brownish.",22965,2
22965,"Also, the mesh inserts in the legs are very scratchy and coarse.",22965,2
22965,Not a fan.,22965,2
22966,"Fabric is good, design as well but the size was small even if I asked for large size",22966,2
22967,"It is not so good, the quality is really bad",22967,2
22968,The arms are really skinny.,22968,2
22968,"I had to return it, which was disappointing since I really liked the design and the fact that it would have folded up into nothing while traveling.",22968,2
22968,"However, the company was decent about the return.",22968,2
22969,Dress runs really small and has a strong chemical smell.,22969,2
22969,Color is totally not as pictured.,22969,2
22970,They were cute just didn't stay up on the side of my ear,22970,2
22971,Too weak to hold any tension - it folded up.,22971,2
22972,FYI-XL is more like a child's large!,22972,2
22973,Oddly shaped at the shoulders and at the slits.,22973,2
22973,"Super cute, but terrible fit.",22973,2
22973,"After some alterations I can make it sit ok, but it shifts as son as I move!",22973,2
22973,It also came with the button holes the wrong size for the buttons!!,22973,2
22973,!,22973,2
22974,"It's really really beautiful, but it broke after 1 week since I wear it.",22974,2
22975,"Wow,  it is big.",22975,2
22975,The head that would fit this hat would have to be huge.,22975,2
22975,My head did not come anywhere close to fitting this hat.,22975,2
22975,It is called a lifeguard hat and I would think that all you could do in a hat this size would be to lounge and it would keep your entire body shaded.,22975,2
22975,I gave it two stars because I didn't like it.,22975,2
22976,Broke a part after a couple months.,22976,2
22977,"I loved the color, but it was made very small.",22977,2
22977,The picture looks way better than what you actually get.,22977,2
22978,"Cute idea, but hair ties just slip off after a minute or two of putting them on.",22978,2
22978,:(,22978,2
22979,They were not as comfortable as I'd hoped and the reviews seemed to say they were.,22979,2
22979,I bought them to wear with my winter boots.,22979,2
22979,"They were thin enough as I live in the south and don't need thick socks, but just didn't like how they felt.",22979,2
22980,Looks like it was made for a very tiny slim girl.,22980,2
22980,"I ordered a large and it looks like an Xs,  Not even for a woman.",22980,2
22980,Did not like it.,22980,2
22981,"need to be satisfied with this purchase, and am not.",22981,2
22982,"made for someone 6', not the average woman.",22982,2
22983,Was too long and with cuffed ankle it does not fit well.,22983,2
22983,"I have not worn it yet, will have to get it adjusted.",22983,2
22983,The color is just right but fabric is a bit thin and cheap looking,22983,2
22984,Beautiful but I'm about a size 12?,22984,2
22984,"Ordered a Large & it fits my arms & shoulders but way open in front, just hangs straight down from my armpits, what a pity.",22984,2
22984,White ordered also/ same,22984,2
22985,This item is way too small,22985,2
22986,I got a large and ithe is not so much too small but the front comes up too high...the back comes to a nice length and the torso actually fits loose.,22986,2
22986,"The fabric is nice and soft and stretchy but the fact that the front comes up so high, it doesn't look right.",22986,2
22987,I just did not like them and that is it,22987,2
22988,Did not like it,22988,2
22989,I really wanted to like this item.,22989,2
22989,But the one I received had really bad rips on both wrists.,22989,2
22989,"It looked almost as if someone bought it before me, stretched out/tore the wrists (because they are fitted) and then returned it.",22989,2
22989,"I'll give it two starts simply because unlike all of the other reviews, the one i received actually did look like the picture.",22989,2
22990,It looks just like I expected but it's made for petite size ladies.,22990,2
22990,Plus size may have a problem like I did.,22990,2
22990,I could wear it but I would have to purchase an extender.,22990,2
22990,It's not bad for the price though,22990,2
22991,Just got the case.,22991,2
22991,It's beautiful.,22991,2
22991,But my phone won't stay in the case.,22991,2
22991,I'm going to have to return it unfortunately.,22991,2
22992,But the Hoodia is good,22992,2
22993,Arrived quickly but was damaged,22993,2
22994,Beautiful diamond however I couldn't get the back screwed on,22994,2
22995,My son loves the shoes and yeah they are cool and all IF WE COULD CHARGE THEM!!,22995,2
22995,The charging piece that sticks into he shoe broke after charging them once!!,22995,2
22995,!,22995,2
22996,I received them fast.,22996,2
22996,They look the same as in the picture shown.,22996,2
22996,The material will shred your skin though!,22996,2
22996,Trying to slide then up my legs was painful enough....but getting them off was miserable as wel .,22996,2
22996,"There is no inner lining, so they are not comfortable to wear either.",22996,2
22996,"They are made cheaply, but if you are in a rut then these will wor .",22996,2
22996,I don't have much of a tooshy and I'm usually a size 25/0-2 in most pants..,22996,2
22996,I'm and XS to a small in panties from VS and I ordered the mediu .,22996,2
22996,"They look big in the package but since there is no stretch to the material, they barely fit me.",22996,2
22996,I'd definitely order a size up for sure!,22996,2

23065,"I purchased a XL 8-10, I really liked the idea of having the under wire and also liked the support the bra was giving, but If your chest if anything bigger then a B-cup, watch out, you'll be hanging out underneath the under wire, or you'll be falling out of the top.",23065,2

23126,The top part does not lay flat either.,23126,2
23126,Very strange fit.,23126,2
23127,This is an awkward bag.,23127,2

23127,"I used it for a few weeks, but now it lives in my closet.",23127,2
23127,Disappointing.,23127,2
23128,It was smaller than expected....and litlle bag's handle broke off the first day...,23128,2
23129,What a weird fitting pair of underwear.,23129,2
23129,Not what I had imagined when seeing it online.,23129,2

23130,Broke after a few days,23130,2
23131,"Im 125 lbs, petite and I ordered it small but it was too small for comfort",23131,2

23134,It was way too large for me.,23134,2
23134,I need to return it.,23134,2
23134,The bottoms will fit someone who is an XL and (I ordered a medium usually I order a small.),23134,2
23134,The top is for someone who is probably a d-plus cup way too big for me.,23134,2

23140,I'm not even trying for the xxl I'm just gonna buy some different ones.,23140,2
23140,Good quality otherwise and very cute but sizing is a complete nightmare.,23140,2
23141,Looks very different on me then the model.,23141,2
23141,Way too small through the shoulders and arms even for Asian sizing,23141,2
23142,I ordered an XL because of review stating it ran small.,23142,2
23142,I weigh 130 lbs and this top is a little tight and the sleeves are too short.,23142,2
23142,The thin material is nice,23142,2
23143,My toddler likes the birds.,23143,2
23143,The weight of the fabric is nice for warmer nights.,23143,2
23143,But they are incredibly long.,23143,2
23143,"My 2 year old fits in most Carter 24month clothes, though he is petite.",23143,2
23143,The Carter 24 month jammies are just way too snug.,23143,2

23145,Very poor quality.,23145,2
23146,Made very cheaply.,23146,2
23146,Not worth the money.,23146,2
23147,"Fits well for a slim fit shirt, definitely is NOT a ""non-iron"" shirt.",23147,2
23147,After running through the washer/dryer it seriously needed ironing.,23147,2
23147,"Based on the reviews, I found the shirt to be a little thicker material than I was expecting after someone said it was so thin.",23147,2
23147,"UPDATE*****4/21/16
This shirt wrinkles if you breathe on it wrong.",23147,2

23148,Didn't like the material,23148,2
23149,I'll never wear this dress.,23149,2
23149,It's too cheap looking.,23149,2
23150,The models wearing these sunglasses must be teeny-tiny.,23150,2

23151,"cute, but the materials are cheap and made my nose hurt SO badly.",23151,2
23152,"Really thin material, runs small.",23152,2

23159,I want to love this dress but it's far too thin.,23159,2
23160,Too expensive for the quality of the shoes.,23160,2
23160,Overpriced,23160,2
23161,Not proportional at all.,23161,2
23162,I ordered a size larger to start with and they are still tight.,23162,2
23163,"poorly made and flimsy fabric, definately not ""like linen""",23163,2
23164,runs very narrow,23164,2
23165,This top looked so cute that I thought I'd just try it.,23165,2
23165,A lot of others posted about a side boob problem which I chose to ignore because I'm very small chested...,23165,2
23165,But I can't even wear this.,23165,2
23165,"It is definitely cute, but chances are it won't work for most people.",23165,2
23165,"If you really want to try it, I'd suggest to only do so if not only your chest size is small but your rib cage as well.",23165,2
23166,Great material.,23166,2
23166,But too short,23166,2
23167,"Not the product that came with collectors edition of the game, cheaper quality with large tag",23167,2
23168,Way too small for my boobs and some off the buttons fell off before it even arrived to me,23168,2
23169,This is not 100% cotton.,23169,2
23169,Contains 30% acrylic.,23169,2
23169,Does not feel anything like linen.,23169,2
23169,Drapes nicely so may keep despite plastic content.,23169,2
23169,:(,23169,2
23170,Ran very small and it doesn't fit like in the picture.,23170,2
23170,Even the collar was too small and choked me a little bit.,23170,2
23170,I'm 5'0 and about 125 pounds but I have a rather large bust.,23170,2
23170,"I can usually fit into a medium or large, but the medium fit like an extra small.",23170,2
23170,The cut outs on the front and back are very awkward and pull clean open.,23170,2
23170,The picture makes this romper look as if it were supposed to be looser and flowy but it's obviously meant to be tight when worn.,23170,2
23170,The leg openings aren't frilly like the picture either.,23170,2
23170,Too bad because the design was rather cute.,23170,2
23170,I returned the product and never got my money back.,23170,2
23171,This earrings dangle and do not fit like picture suggest.,23171,2
23171,I've even tried bending them and that didn't work.,23171,2
23172,Ordered a size up in the waist after reading reviews- running small is common.,23172,2
23172,"Note that the ""navy"" color is green with blue threds interwoven- actualy quite noce, but not navy blue.",23172,2
23172,The fabric is a wool/cotton/stuff blend and only 38% wool with a half lining.,23172,2
23172,"For the price, one would expect full lining and an 60+% wool blend with some synthetic fiber for strength.",23172,2
23173,"Size and quality lower then ""cheap"" expectancy",23173,2
23174,Was not the color I expected at all was a dull red instead of a burgundy but have to suck it up to late to look for another.,23174,2
23175,Horrible quality!,23175,2
23176,Thin.,23176,2
23177,tight in shoulders and chest,23177,2
23178,Cute but Too small for my face.,23178,2
23179,"Skimpy fabric, poor tailoring.",23179,2
23180,looks great on picture.,23180,2
23180,Thats about it,23180,2
23181,Can't wear these at all.,23181,2
23181,"I ordered the large/xlarge, which wouldn't fit anyone over 125-30 pounds.",23181,2
23182,This is too short to be called a tunic.,23182,2
23182,Really not what I was expecting based on the pictures.,23182,2
23183,Straight hinges for septum huuurrttt so much.,23183,2
23183,Can't keep it in longer than 5 minutes.,23183,2
23183,Need something curved.,23183,2
23183,It is very pretty though.,23183,2
23183,Wish it didn't hurt so much.,23183,2
23184,Runs at least one or two sizes small.,23184,2
23184,"If you normally wear a large, order either XL or XXL.",23184,2
23184,"This jacket has a small US Flag, where coat size tags are normally found, with Designed in the USA label, but the fine print clearly states made in China.",23184,2
23184,Very deceptive!,23184,2
23184,(Lost two stars for that.),23184,2
23184,Light-weight jacket.,23184,2
23184,Do not plan to carry anything very heavy in the pockets.,23184,2
23184,"Overall, it seems to be better quality compared to many items made in China.",23184,2
23184,"IF the size was more accurate and the outfit did not try so hard to hide where this jacket was actually made, I would have given it four-stars.",23184,2
23185,Everything fits ok but the band from the pant.,23185,2
23185,Its tight and if you are bloated or just have a bigger belly its uncomfortable.,23185,2
23185,"I wouldn't buy them again, unfortunately I bought two sets.",23185,2
23186,they are cute BUT the bottom separated from the sole of the shoe in less than 2 weeks,23186,2
23187,cute but after a few weeks it changed color.. not sterling silver,23187,2
23188,This pendant is not well made--it looks like there's glue overflow on the little cat's face where they put it together.,23188,2
23188,"You get what you pay for, but I wouldn't buy it again.",23188,2
23189,thumb holes to small,23189,2
23190,"I really love this hand bag, fits my phone, cards, money and more.",23190,2
23190,I was just really sad to see that after only a month the lining has already come apart.,23190,2
23191,At least it was expensive.,23191,2
23191,Not at all what i thought it would be.,23191,2
23191,1.,23191,2
23191,The lace atound the edges was just straight cut leaving lots of treads out.,23191,2
23191,2.,23191,2
23191,Zipper sucks and won't move past a certain point.,23191,2
23191,3.,23191,2
23191,Under skirt isn't how its discribed in photos.,23191,2
23191,Its double layered and ment to frame an hour glass shape but the top lace was sewed wrong so it bubbles out.,23191,2
23191,4.,23191,2
23191,Again the lace that over hangs is bluntly cut with no design in mind.,23191,2
23191,5.,23191,2
23191,The bottom of the longest layer has lace on it as well which causes the top layers tl hang weird.,23191,2
23191,Not flowing 6.,23191,2
23191,Top bust area is size to me but this dress style wasn't ment for someone that is endowed.,23191,2
23191,7.?Shoulder straps will break im sure of it.,23191,2
23191,Very thin material badly sewn together.,23191,2
23191,Most of it seems fixable with a good seamstress but unhappy with the lack of  description.,23191,2
23191,Delevery was also a week later then the original tracking number  anticipated.,23191,2
23191,And then was delivered one day late after it was updated.,23191,2
23192,Was not as cute as in the pictures.,23192,2
23192,Fit weird.,23192,2
23193,So pretty.,23193,2
23193,But way too small,23193,2
23194,smaller then I thought,23194,2
23195,Sure it made a bit of a difference but not enough to warrant how uncomfortable it was.,23195,2
23195,Note the red tag was before.,23195,2
23196,Looks really cool.,23196,2
23196,"Has the style I was looking for, but after  2 months I'm already looking for a new wallet.",23196,2
23196,It's pleather not leather so it's scratching off and showing the grey insides of the fake leather .,23196,2
23196,3 Rivets have fallen off already.,23196,2
23196,"Like I said, looks cool but that's about it",23196,2
23197,It is way too big on me looks totally DIFFERENT than picture I hate it,23197,2
23198,Got the white ones and i love how they fit and feel.,23198,2
23198,"However, the material is very thin and with no lining you can see right through them.",23198,2
23198,I imagine if they got wet you would see my junk clear as day.,23198,2
23198,So they are going back,23198,2
23199,Would not purchase again.....thin....,23199,2
23200,"I find that the material is real comfortable, but the one size fit all does not truly fit for all in my opinion.",23200,2
23200,I'm 5'3 and the leggings isn't as tight as other leggings I have.,23200,2
23200,"As the minutes go by, the leggings would slip down.",23200,2
23200,"Within 5 minutes, the bottom of the leggings where your ankles (or Cankles depending how far along you are in your pregnancy), it just bunches up and it looks UGLY.",23200,2
23200,"Also, the leggings where the ankles located.",23200,2
23200,The leggings is not fitting.,23200,2
23200,It's loose so it looks even more uglier.,23200,2
23200,This leggings feel like it would have fit someone that's about 5'6 or taller.,23200,2
23200,I purchased a pair of leggings at Target and it fits so much better than this pair.,23200,2
23200,I wish I can return it even after I wore it just once.,23200,2
23200,"Comfortable, but not worth keeping.",23200,2
23201,This was ordered as a 2X but actually fit smaller than a 1x,23201,2
23202,Based on reveiwes and the posted size chaet i ordered two sizes up (Xl) and the shirt was still too small.,23202,2
23202,Arms were too tight and it was like a belly shirt.,23202,2
23202,Not worth returning will be giving to a friend's daughter.,23202,2
23203,The photo shows a fitted cut.,23203,2
23203,It is not like that.,23203,2
23203,It is boxy like a mans shirt.,23203,2
23204,I need this umbrella for a costume that I'm making  and it arrived filthy all over and the handle was bent.,23204,2
23204,"I will repurchase one,  as this is exactly what I need and I cannot find it elsewhere, but would not recommend unless you don't mind returning things.",23204,2
23204,Hoping the new one will be better quality.,23204,2
23205,It is easy to unhook to breastfeed but the straps will not stay on my shoulders.,23205,2
23205,It also is not as comfortable as I was hoping.,23205,2
23205,I feel that the straps are oddly wider than most bras.,23205,2
23205,It feels very awkward.,23205,2
23206,Too small and very thin fabric.,23206,2
23207,Ran very small.,23207,2
23207,Fabric was cheap.,23207,2
23208,Cute dress but definitely not made out of a thick material at all....,23208,2
23208,It was just to see through and showed way too much even with a slip underneath.,23208,2
23208,Ended up sending it back.,23208,2
23208,It's too bad though because if it was a heavier knit I'd have kept it.,23208,2
23209,This hoodie runs really small.,23209,2
23209,I usually take a medium and ordered an extra large based upon feedbacks.,23209,2
23209,"Good thing, it is skin tight.",23209,2
23209,Material is funky.,23209,2
23209,"Not really sweatshirt, not a sweater.",23209,2
23209,The picture makes it look warm and cozy.,23209,2
23209,It's not either.,23209,2
23210,The dress is too big in the hip area so I have to find a seamstress to pull it in some because the shipping to send it back costs more than what I paid for the dress alone.,23210,2
23211,Bad smell,23211,2
23212,They aren't wide scarves,23212,2
23213,Very poor fit,23213,2
23214,You get what you pay for.,23214,2
23214,"Cheap material, shiny & skin tight.",23214,2
23215,I ordered a size up based on reviews and it didn't even come close to fitting.,23215,2
23215,Very disappointed.,23215,2
23215,Will be returning.,23215,2
23216,"I'm not sure in what universe this is a D cup, but it's not.",23216,2
23216,Other than the D size being the size of a B cup it's an alright bra.,23216,2
23216,"If you have smaller breast I would recomme it but as for the ladies like me who have a little bit more, look elsewhere.",23216,2
23217,smells like fish!!,23217,2
23217,!,23217,2
23218,was not like picture as it was lined heavily,23218,2
23219,The torso is to small.,23219,2
23219,Other than that it's a nice suit,23219,2
23220,I really wanted to love this dress.,23220,2
23220,The print is beautiful and the fit isn't actually that bad.,23220,2
23220,The material has no give to it.,23220,2
23220,It doesn't stretch at all so it was uncomfortable.,23220,2
23220,Raising my arms causes the whole dress to go up.,23220,2
23220,I have to send it back.,23220,2
23221,The part that lifts your butt was too small it made my butt look abnormal.,23221,2
23222,Very pretty earrings.,23222,2
23222,I bought these because I love angels.,23222,2
23222,"However, no matter how hard you try, these will NOT stay in your ears.",23222,2
23222,They constantly fall out or dangle by the bottom.,23222,2
23222,The top portion will not stay connected to your ear.,23222,2
23222,I've already lost one.,23222,2
23222,Don't waste your money.,23222,2
23222,:-(,23222,2
23223,These are made from a nice material but that's really the only redeeming quality.,23223,2
23223,"They don't lie flat on the breast and they bunch up between the petals, and if you don't lay them on perfectly the first time, you can't fix it at all because they won't stick.",23223,2
23224,This shirt is ok.,23224,2
23224,It is cute but the material is very thin and it's not as long as it looks.,23224,2
23224,The material started coming apart at the sleeve.,23224,2
23225,I do not like the fit.,23225,2
23226,Very cheep fabric.,23226,2
23226,Cut is slim cut.,23226,2
23227,Weird fit.. Too big and thin.,23227,2
23227,Had to return,23227,2
23228,I got these because I love The Little Mermaid.,23228,2
23228,"They are cheaply made, very thin (you can see my underwear) and the size is way too small.",23228,2
23228,XL fits as a medium.,23228,2
23228,To be fair though this product comes from overseas so their sizing is different (learned that the hard way).,23228,2
23228,"I am about 5'8"" and typically wear size 13-15 in juniors jeans and the XL is too tight.",23228,2
23229,"I knew I was going to have to wear this for a themed wedding today, so I can't return it.",23229,2
23229,"But it's is a nice idea that is portly executed, the hem in the front is already coming loose, and had a huge hole in it.",23229,2
23229,And the hooks at the front were partially missing so I had to tack it together.,23229,2
23229,I am very disappointed.,23229,2
23229,Try to buy from a different brand.,23229,2
23229,This dress is not high quality.,23229,2
23229,I haven't even made it through the day yet!,23229,2
23229,It's 10 am!!!,23229,2
23229,And I've been sitting here in a dress that's falling apart!,23229,2
23230,"Had potential, but the ruffle part of the dress was too large and see through.",23230,2
23231,The tag claims a cotton blend but the material is definitely NOT cotton.,23231,2
23232,A bit sheer (aka see through).,23232,2
23232,Good if you are looking for footless tights; bad if you are looking for leggings.,23232,2
23233,Completely see through!,23233,2
23234,Not as pictured.,23234,2
23235,"I expected that it would run a bit small after reading previous comments, but it was extremely small.",23235,2
23235,What really disappointed me though was the color.,23235,2
23235,From the picture it appears to be just black which is what I expected and wanted.,23235,2
23235,However it has white highlights all over the embroidered pattern.,23235,2
23235,"Overall a miss, but not worth sending back so we'all make it work.",23235,2
23236,I like the look of.these however they are to tiny they fit my little girl perfectly .,23236,2
23236,these need to be rated as kids glasses not adults.disappointed .,23236,2
23237,Way too tiny.,23237,2
23237,I'm 118 pounds and they do not fit.,23237,2
23237,I can wear them but they stretch heavily.,23237,2
23238,sizing chart is way off add two sizes to anything you get from them.,23238,2
23239,the stitch around the flower petals makes it look cheap,23239,2
23240,color drained on first wash - looks navy now vs. black,23240,2
23241,Couldn't zip up.,23241,2
23241,Way to small.,23241,2
23241,Beautiful.,23241,2
23241,Bought for my honeymoon.. but now my daughter has a new dress.,23241,2
23241,This sucks,23241,2
23242,Not big enough to cover all of my hair.,23242,2
23242,Dose not look like the picture,23242,2
23243,fits smaller than expected,23243,2
23244,Too small.,23244,2
23244,material very cheap would not recommend.,23244,2
23245,I really was looking forward to wear this dress at my brothers wedding.,23245,2
23245,When the dress arrived I realized that the pretty beading in the front of the dress was just a sticker.,23245,2
23245,Very disappointing.,23245,2
23245,I guess I was expecting the beading to be sewn to the dress.,23245,2
23246,The band it good.,23246,2
23246,BUT the rough side of it is super scratchy!!!!!!,23246,2
23246,I could hardly stand wearing it.,23246,2
23246,The company selling it responded immediately and helped me with the issue.,23246,2
23247,"really cheaply made, never wore it out.",23247,2
23247,Maybe for a swimsuit cover up?,23247,2
23248,"Cheap looking, shiny polyester.",23248,2
23248,"Too much fabric in the back, where the waistband is completely elastic and the extra fabric in the full skirt is scrunched up on it.",23248,2
23248,Waistband is only flat in the front.,23248,2
23248,The pleats don't stay.,23248,2
23248,Adds 10 pounds to your figure.,23248,2
23248,Very frumpy looking.,23248,2
23248,It could probably be used for a costume.,23248,2
23249,"it took 32 days to arrive, which was a bit of a bummer.",23249,2
23249,The scarves are cute but kind of cheap looking and the zebra one was frayed already.,23249,2
23250,"These came in broken,  one of the jewels had fallen off.",23250,2
23250,Other than that they look true to the picture.,23250,2
23251,It came and it was completely different but I'll still wear it so 2 stars,23251,2
23252,They skirt is big so if you usually buy a x large buy large you can  tighten it up yourself by placing a small slit in the waist where the rubber band is pull it tighter,23252,2
23253,"This is a pretty good phone case, it shipped from China even though the sellers website said Texas.",23253,2
23253,The picture of lilo and stitch was very pixilated buy not horrible and the center of stitches eyes which should be white are pink like the back ground picture.,23253,2
23253,"It's not perfect, but it works as a phone case.",23253,2
23253,The top and bottom of the phone along as the screen edges will not be protected with this case,23253,2
23254,cute but way small,23254,2
23255,Way too big.,23255,2
23256,Need to buy one size bigger than you normally wear,23256,2
23257,they fit smaller than expected and are bulky and clumsy.,23257,2
23258,Much larger than they look online.,23258,2
23258,Not worth paying over $7 on return shipping.,23258,2
23258,Trash can.,23258,2
23259,"Poor Quality, The Sizing Is Like Two Sizes Bigger Than Normal, All In All A Total Waste Of Money",23259,2
23260,It looks cute in the photo but beware very cheaply made.,23260,2
23260,I got gold and it faded on day 2 can no longer wear i know you get what you pay for but still very disapointed.,23260,2
23261,I was disappointed that this kilt only comes to the bottom of my thigh instead of my knee.,23261,2
23261,I also had a belt loop come off in the first week.,23261,2
23261,I would probably return this if it wasn't too late already.,23261,2
23262,"Well made shirt, just very runs very small!",23262,2
23262,Looks like maybe women sizes,23262,2
23263,"I used the size chart provided and ordered the appropriate size, however, this dress fit waaay too small!",23263,2
23263,I was extremely disappointed because the dress itself is really pretty.,23263,2
23264,"I bought a large, but it should have been labeled a small size.",23264,2
23264,Very tiny.,23264,2
23264,Cute though!,23264,2
23264,Too bad I can't fit into it.,23264,2
23264,Can't even return it.,23264,2
23265,"I ordered a L that I ""usually"" wear.",23265,2

23268,Runs small.,23268,2
23268,"I ordered purple, but the color is more of a pink/magenta, than purple.",23268,2
23269,This coverup barely hits my hip and is much more snug than the photo shows.,23269,2
23269,"I'm 5'4"" and busty with a 28"".",23269,2
23269,"I measured this coverup and from the center front of the neck to the center bottom hemline it is only 20"", from the center back if the neck to the center bottom hemline it is 26"", from the shoulder seams to the bottom center hemline it is 28"", from shoulder seam to side bottom hemline is 26"", and at the waist is it only 16"" wide pretty much all of the way down, which would mean a max of a 32"" bust, waist, or hip and that would be snug.",23269,2
23269,"The model in the photo must be 4'10, and 80 lbs maximum!",23269,2
23269,There are also loose threads all over.,23269,2

23272,I ended up returning them.,23272,2
23273,"Almost all said ""the sizing is wrong"" I got a large.",23273,2
23273,Sleeves are small.,23273,2
23273,It fit like a child's jacket.,23273,2
23273,Other then that it's a really cute jacket.,23273,2
23274,It looks great as shown in the pic but it's to tight,23274,2
23275,"Not sure what kind of sizing this goes by, but I got a large, and it was way too small.",23275,2
23275,It may be more suitable for juniors rather than women.,23275,2
23276,"Really thin material,,,",23276,2
23277,This swim suit is extremely cute and the style and material is awesome.,23277,2
23277,"But, OMG, the size is way way way way off.",23277,2
23277,I ordered a large and it did not fit pass my thighs.,23277,2

23282,"Looks nothing like the picture, and I can't say I'll ever wear it, way too small",23282,2
23283,"Film over the screen makes it difficult to type, have to press hard on the buttons for them to read.",23283,2
23283,"Also, you need the adapter for any headphones to fit and any after market charger will not fit.",23283,2
23283,"It does protect your phone from water and drops, but it is not a very user-friendly case.",23283,2
23284,Had to return immediately.,23284,2
23285,Item was not as expected.,23285,2
23285,"I didn't know the material was shiny, which is weird.",23285,2
23285,"Second, the turtleneck looks weird even when I fold it down.",23285,2
23285,I also don't have big hips so the dress doesn't look like a bodycon dress at all.,23285,2
23285,"The length is great and it is comfortable, but what really bothers me the most are the sleeves.",23285,2
23285,They look so loose on me!,23285,2
23285,:( It was affordable but I'll have to think about whether I want to wear it out.,23285,2
23286,Size up.,23286,2
23287,Will not buy them again.,23287,2
23287,"The waist is too large and has no elastic inside, so I have to constantly pull them up.",23287,2
23288,went 2 sizes bigger still too small.,23288,2
23289,"After the second day of wear (these were purchased in late June for the new school year that started on 8/29), the elastic ""lace"" snapped and frayed.",23289,2
23289,They are otherwise cute shoes but disappointed in the lack of durability and inability to return,23289,2
23290,Not what I am wearing right now.,23290,2
23290,"Pretty, but this doesn't look like mine.",23290,2
23291,Cute item but way too small,23291,2
23292,Inner layer tore at seem in very short time.,23292,2

23293,I ordered the dress for my granddaughter who loves to play dressup.,23293,2
23293,It is NOT as pictured.,23293,2
23293,It is a very plain version of the picture.,23293,2
23293,She loves the dress but buyer beware it is not the dress in the picture.,23293,2
23294,I think I've worn this once....,23294,2
23294,It's an itchy hot fabric and fits oddly....,23294,2
23294,"I've only paired it with leggings, as it's pretty freaking short on the sides and rides up over time.",23294,2
23294,Didn't feel like it was flattering for me.,23294,2
23295,I returned it.,23295,2
23295,I didn't like the collar.,23295,2
23295,It was really big and didn't look right.,23295,2
23295,The colors were nice and bright though.,23295,2
23296,"Very pretty picture, a little tight for my liking, not long it comes just below my hips, i HATE the material.",23296,2
23296,"Im a cotton kind of girl, its like spandex.",23296,2
23296,I had bought it to be a gym shirt but it rides up.,23296,2
23297,The black disc on the cufflink fell out the first time it was worn.,23297,2
23297,The shirt studs looked great and did not fall apart.,23297,2
23298,"Delivered ahead of schedule, by a couple of weeks.",23298,2
23298,Fits somewhat large.,23298,2
23298,I may have to adjust the straps.,23298,2
23298,"After trying it on, I took it off to inspect it further.",23298,2
23298,I found that there were spots of what looked like dried spit...,23298,2
23298,The extra star was for the fast delivery.,23298,2
23299,They look cute but slide off really easily,23299,2
23300,They don't come in individual sizes so you just get a pair and they are to big,23300,2
23301,Very frustrated as we ordered a size 0-3 months an it was way to big!,23301,2
23301,Looks more like a 6-12 month size give 2 stars for softness an quick delivery was gonna use as a Halloween costume but no way can he use it,23301,2
23302,The nighty does not look like the picture...the colors are two different colors that do not match and the sizing chart is way off.,23302,2
23303,Small across stomach big under arms.,23303,2
23303,trying to figure out how to return it,23303,2
23304,"These tights are amazing EXCEPT, the crotch is a different color!",23304,2
23304,I ordered the blue reindeer.,23304,2
23304,The tights are a nice blueish/purplish reindeer but the crotch is white reindeer.,23304,2
23304,The white really stands out.,23304,2
23304,I purchased these for a Christmas gift.,23304,2
23304,I was so embarrassed when she opened her gift (I did not open the packaging so I did not notice when they were delivered).,23304,2
23304,I bought 2 pair and they were both like this.,23304,2
23304,The recipient does not plan to wear them alone as pants so she would not let me return them otherwise they would have gone right back!,23304,2
23304,The material seems to be of high quality and they are warm and fuzzy on the inside.,23304,2
23304,BUT THE CROTCH IS A DIFFERNT COLOR!!!!!,23304,2
23304,I have attached a picture although it is hard to notice the difference because of the lighting.,23304,2
23304,"Trust me, it really stands out in person.",23304,2
23305,Quality isn't that great.,23305,2
23306,They were ok,23306,2
23307,Good bag but looks way different than it does in the picture,23307,2
23308,Didn't like the color or quality.,23308,2
23309,Very fitted.,23309,2
23309,Not a line like I expected.,23309,2
23310,This made for a child.,23310,2
23310,I have a small waist and this still was too small.,23310,2
23310,It is well made but way too small.,23310,2
23310,"I would buy it again if it was larger in size,.",23310,2
23311,Chip material,23311,2
23312,Disapointed.,23312,2
23312,Very see-thru.,23312,2
23312,Was so tight & poor quality.,23312,2
23312,Better used as a night gown.,23312,2
23313,Much shorter than the picture would have you believe.,23313,2
23313,I was very disappointed.,23313,2
23313,I am a size 6 and 5'8.,23313,2
23313,The quality was good and the delivery was on time.,23313,2
23314,"Beautiful earings, but they kind of stick out a little differently than expected, and the end of the stirrup on one of them was so sharp I started looking for a cup but tool to sand it down a little as it hurt behind my ear.",23314,2
23314,"Because of the design, these were difficult to put in, because the navigation of getting the stirrup into your ear was blocked of course by the wooden earring.",23314,2
23314,No fault of the earring really.,23314,2
23314,I just found them difficult to put in.,23314,2
23314,"After a week, one of them broke falling into the floor (about 3 feet onto a wood floor) from a table.",23314,2
23314,So they are very fragile.,23314,2
23314,The major flaws are the poorly made stirrup that goes into your ear (just to sharp and rough at the end) and the fact that they are soo soo fragile.,23314,2
23314,Still pretty if you can keep them from breaking.,23314,2
23315,Darker than the one shown and very thin and sliky softn perfect to wear in hot or nice warm weather.,23315,2
23315,Wished it were longer and thicker.,23315,2
23315,Good for the price but wuldnt buu again.,23315,2
23316,It's strange that the seller bothered to specify that the ring will not turn your finger green.,23316,2
23316,I had a green line above the top and bottom of the ring within 3 days because all of the top coat tarnished off.,23316,2
23316,It looks nothing like it did when I bought it a week ago.,23316,2
23316,: {,23316,2
23317,Too large for normal size wrist.,23317,2
23317,Very delicate.,23317,2
23318,"Very stiff material, hood didn't fall right on the head & this thing was super long.",23318,2
23318,"I'm 5'4"" & even in heels it was dragging far back from me & its easy to trip over.",23318,2
23318,I returned it even though I wanted to love it.,23318,2
23319,The band in between the butt stands out and doesn't go in how it's supposed to.,23319,2
23319,It should fit like a string underwear.,23319,2
23319,I was so excited to use it and I will but only at home.,23319,2
23320,It was very small.,23320,2
23320,I usually wear a size 6 or 8 in most clothes.,23320,2
23320,I ordered an 8 just to be safe and it would not come close to zipping.,23320,2
23320,I reordered two sizes bigger to see if that would fit better.,23320,2
23321,"It's a good idea, but it slips, and the finish quickly came off of the buckle.",23321,2
23321,Don't waste your money.,23321,2
23322,some button holes were too small for the button.,23322,2
23322,some buttons didn't unfasten,23322,2
23323,its god one but its too small to fits for any adult,23323,2
23324,poor quality.,23324,2
23324,very thin,23324,2
23325,"Too small, doesn't stretch",23325,2
23326,very cheap looking,23326,2
23327,These are OK.,23327,2
23327,I could have bought some leggings from the dollar store and cut slits in the legs and got the same thing......,23327,2
23328,Not even close in size,23328,2
23329,Glad I sized up because it runs very small but I do like the vest.,23329,2
23329,Sizing up is recommended!,23329,2
23330,I was expecting something with more storage.,23330,2
23330,"However, I am using the product until I can find something else.",23330,2
23331,was very odd stitching .,23331,2
23331,on one left arm it was able to roll up and button but the other you cant roll it up and button because there isn't any ....,23331,2
23332,Definitely not as much stretch as I imagined.,23332,2
23332,One pair ripped on the inside seam during first wear so I'm too afraid to wear the other out.,23332,2
23332,There is more of a texture than I expected which is nice for dressing up but not for daily comfort.,23332,2
23333,I didn't like the shirt it was to short and too small.,23333,2
23334,Dress was beautiful but the sizes are completely off!,23334,2
23335,Uncomfortable fit.,23335,2
23335,The armholes are tight.,23335,2
23335,Would have to try to fix or just give it away.,23335,2
23336,The specs on the watch stated that it requires an 18mm band.,23336,2
23336,This is an 18mm band but it's about 1mm small so it routinely pops out of the socket.,23336,2
23336,Feels good and the quality seems ok but its fit is dubious.,23336,2
23337,Shipping was adequate.,23337,2
23337,"It is a very cheap quality shirt, and the words on the shirt looks like an iron-on.",23337,2
23337,Afraid it won't hold up after a few washes.,23337,2
23337,It is worth half the price but not $20.,23337,2
23338,Ordered my normal size and it was too small by a lot.,23338,2
23339,Usually im a medium but with this product itd be better to buy one size up cause it runs a little small.,23339,2
23339,I should have gotten a large instead,23339,2
23340,"With in 2 weeks of wearing this the skull has changes colors, the silver has worn off",23340,2
23341,I just received this yesterday and it already broke.,23341,2
23341,It's a cute bead so I'm really bummed.,23341,2
23342,Cheaply made,23342,2
23343,After less than two weeks of using this as directed the band is constantly scrunching up in the middle and riding up.,23343,2
23343,The scrunching is so bad that there are now permanent ridges in the middle of the band.,23343,2
23343,"I really wanted to like this and I think it was working well, but I don't know that I can continue using it when it is this uncomfortable due to the bunching.",23343,2
23344,very disappointed.,23344,2
23344,My daughter used this umbrella only 2 times and already the arm support rods are bending and not holding the umbrella tightly opened.,23344,2
23344,Will be packaging up and sending back to Totes to try to get a new one.,23344,2
23345,They stretch out quickly as you wear them.,23345,2
23345,Cute when you 1st put them on,23345,2
23346,Dress said large it was more like a med.,23346,2
23347,Said large on tag.,23347,2
23347,I ordered large.,23347,2
23347,"Can't close front by 3"".",23347,2
23347,Gave it to my wife.,23347,2
23348,Not impressed.,23348,2
23348,Fabric is static attractive,23348,2
23349,Material is too thin.,23349,2
23350,One ear clip broke upon taking it out of the packaging,23350,2
23351,"This is a very nice looking bag, also very functional.",23351,2
23351,"However, first time out, the hook broke apart, like it was made of plastic.",23351,2
23351,"There were two suits, four shirts, and two pairs of shoes in the bag.",23351,2
23351,Absolutely NOT stuffed full.,23351,2
23351,"It hung for about an hour, then just fell to the floor with the hook assembly in shattered pieces.",23351,2
23352,This made me look 49 lbs heavier and way to small in my bust size.,23352,2
23352,It was pretty but bulky.,23352,2
23353,This looks more like a night gown than a swim suit cover.,23353,2
23353,It fits about 2 sizes to small.,23353,2
23353,The color is not as vibrant as in the pictures although still a pretty color.,23353,2
23353,Cheaply made.,23353,2
23353,Although with all that being said it is a good price.,23353,2
23353,Even for what you get.,23353,2
23353,It gets 2 stars for the price and how fast I received it which was much fast than it had estimated.,23353,2
23353,Would not buy this again and would not recommend it.,23353,2
23354,Fits tight and is very very thin.,23354,2
23355,"My size normally is Medium, but I bought this dress Large size, and it is so small.",23355,2
23355,I'm very disappointed.,23355,2
23356,I am 5ft 6 in & 177lbs & usually order s L or even an XL.,23356,2
23356,I ordered the L & found it to be too loose fitting & lacking any structure in the design of the dress.,23356,2
23356,Returning,23356,2
23357,"I ordered this top thinking it was the pretty baby blue color that shows in the picture and it actually arrived in a fairly ""ugly"" green color.",23357,2
23357,It also ran small even with ordering up in size based on the reviews.,23357,2
23357,It's hanging in my closet and I've yet to wear it.,23357,2
23358,"It looks exactly like the picture, so they get some credit for that.",23358,2
23358,The sizing is off considerably though.,23358,2
23358,I bought an xl and it was waaaaayyy small.,23358,2
23358,It could fit a skinny child.,23358,2
23358,Sent it back and got a refund right away.,23358,2
23358,Points for that.,23358,2
23359,Not the same as they used to be.,23359,2
23359,They changed the way they make their flip flops and they don't fit the way I like.,23359,2
23360,"Runs,much smaller then the 2x in tech gear.",23360,2
23361,Runs small.,23361,2
23361,Size 6 fits like a 4,23361,2
23362,I ordered this in the men's dept and was disappointed when I received it.,23362,2
23362,I ordered a XXL and what I received might fit an eight year old..it was to late to return it as it was a Christmas gift..it is a nice for boys but not for grown men.,23362,2
23363,too small,23363,2
23364,I knew this belt was too good to be true.,23364,2
23364,"I received it and it fit fine, but it smelled so terrible that I couldn't even wear it in public.",23364,2
23364,"I tried EVERYTHING to get the stench out, but nothing seemed to work.",23364,2
23365,"I was so bummed when I put I this dress, because I wanted it to work out so badly!",23365,2
23365,"Unfortunately the slit in the front on my 5'11"" curvaceous body just looked obscene.",23365,2
23365,I returned it with no trouble at all for a full refund.,23365,2
23366,"Looking at the reviews I decided to buy 1 size up and get a medium which was a bad idea this was a lil too big for me and length wise to short it was very flimsy and cheap material used to make this , if you do buy this it's best you wear it in the summer, other than that I was a waste of money I'm my opinion",23366,2
23367,Medium is too small so I'll need to exchange them.,23367,2
23367,"However, they do feel well made!",23367,2
23368,Stitching came undone after being worn once.,23368,2
23369,"Haven't worn them yet, but they do not have the silicone band as described on the headline so I was pretty disappointed about that as that was one of the main reason I got these ones.",23369,2
23369,They still look cute!,23369,2
23369,"Just feel annoyed about being mislead, but what are you gonna do with such a cheap price.",23369,2
23370,Cute but they all broke,23370,2
23371,"Very form fitting, not like other Allegra K tops that I purchased.",23371,2
23371,Bummer.,23371,2
23372,Good but small,23372,2
23373,Super adorable shoes!,23373,2
23373,I've been looking for slippers for my son!,23373,2
23373,"However, they have a strong odor.",23373,2
23373,"I think it's the material but until I can get that smell out,  he won't be wearing these.",23373,2
23374,this outfit would be so cute if it fit right... sucks that i have to return it,23374,2
23375,The pattern is cute but the material does not look good...,23375,2
23375,"It's thick and costume-like , very heavy and just not a good buy for me as I returned it...",23375,2
23376,I'm normally a size 1-2 in skinny jeans.,23376,2
23376,"I'm 5' 1"" and weigh 108lbs.",23376,2
23376,"These fit, but they are more snug than they are on the model, even though I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered the size 6 for a slouchy ""boyfriend jeans"" look.",23376,2
23376,"If you are considering ordering these, order at least two sizes up.",23376,2
23377,The  design is great but the T-shirt itself is very horrible quality and sleeves were cut evenly!,23377,2
23378,I'm slipping in barre class with these.,23378,2
23378,"They probably work okay on a hard floor, but not carpet.",23378,2
23378,:/,23378,2
23379,They are way too short and don't fit my legs SOS.,23379,2
23379,Just an average sized human bean ugh.,23379,2
23380,Waist band thick roll -  no woman wants that.,23380,2
23380,Material inside layer is tan outside layer denim tone.,23380,2
23380,So leggings appear thin and people think the tan inner layer is your nakedness so very unbecoming.,23380,2
23380,Had the manufacturer instead used black inner layer this woul,23380,2
23381,Too small.,23381,2
23381,Difficult for my 11 year old and 7 year old to put on by themselves.,23381,2
23381,They say it hurts,23381,2
23382,Nothing like the picture.,23382,2
23382,Fits more Like a square.,23382,2
23383,"I found these to be too big for me, which the opposite is usually the case.",23383,2
23383,I also found the fabric to be strange.,23383,2
23383,It was closer to a Halloween costume than a quality I would wear everyday.,23383,2
23383,The fabric is a polyester with very little stretch.,23383,2
23383,"The scales are printed on, so you can feel them crackle when you walk.",23383,2
23383,I returned these.,23383,2
23384,It looks different on the site,23384,2
23385,"Got my package today after at least a month of waiting, and was disappointed.",23385,2
23385,"I ordered a x-large (usually I wear a medium) and it fit so that was nice, but the material is terrible.",23385,2
23385,It's completely see threw and looks more like something u would wear to bed then out in public.,23385,2
23386,2xl i ordered for length as hisband is tall but thin build.,23386,2
23386,Shirt is huge in width and not length.,23386,2
23387,The top barely fits for a medium and the bottoms were ordered as a medium and fit as if they were an XS.,23387,2
23388,Small fits like a large,23388,2
23389,does not fit true to size.,23389,2
23389,an XL is more like a Med.,23389,2
23390,I really liked the look of these online because I wanted aviators but with a bit of a twist.,23390,2
23390,"When they were delivered, I realized that the pictures posted on the website didn't show how flat they were.",23390,2
23390,"Normal glasses have a bit of a curve, but these do not.",23390,2
23390,"They are pretty big for my face, and I wear my old glasses way more than these now.",23390,2
23390,"I don't really like to wear them in front of people because I think they look funny, but this is just my opinion.",23390,2
23390,I guess you get what you pay for.,23390,2
23391,"I ordered small,  Asian Small which is usually smaller than US sizing, and the pants fit very baggily and it requires most of the drawstring to keep them up on my waist.",23391,2
23391,I find them uncomfortable and fit for somebody twice my size.,23391,2
23391,"Also I couldn't see in the picture, but the legs have ""I'M A DREAMER"" in gray randomly on the sides, and it was honestly an unexpected surprise.",23391,2
23392,The arms were to small,23392,2
23393,Quite small.,23393,2
23393,Holds very little.,23393,2
23393,Quality is okay,23393,2
23394,It is ok.,23394,2
23395,"Runs very small, keep this in mind if ordering.",23395,2
23396,Too small and poor quality.,23396,2
23397,"Really cute shirt, well made.",23397,2
23397,Giving two stars because I ordered an XL and this shirt is an Asian XL which is like a small/medium in American sizing.,23397,2
23397,Giving the shirt to a smaller breasted friend of mine whom this shirt will actually fit.,23397,2
23397,RUNS VERY SMALL!!!,23397,2
23397,!,23397,2
23398,"If you are expecting it to look like rose petals as I was, you may be disappointed...it looks more like large drops of blood (or chunks of blood).",23398,2
23398,"The woman herself looks very clear, I think it's just a matter of the graphics needing to be refined a bit.",23398,2
23399,"Very cute however material and style, however the v shape open in the front doesn't cover anything.",23399,2
23399,"Would have to wear a tank top under or use double sided tape, looks off.",23399,2
23399,I returned it.,23399,2
23400,Returned the item.,23400,2
23401,sadly it arived broken :(,23401,2
23402,VERY see through.,23402,2
23403,I fell in love with the dress from the picture!,23403,2
23403,Unfortunately it was about a foot and half too long and I couldn't get the zipper up.,23403,2
23403,"I followed the measurement chart and went a size up to fit my chest, but it still didn't fit.",23403,2
23403,I'm so disappointed.,23403,2
23404,Its cute and all.,23404,2
23404,Im 34B and usually fit a large in bottoms.,23404,2
23404,I got the XL according to the size chart.,23404,2
23404,bottoms were ok but felt like if i went swimming it could reveal too much.,23404,2
23404,The top was just too big in the breast area.,23404,2
23404,I just returned it,23404,2
23405,The elastic around the wrist is way too tight and the glove part is too big.,23405,2
23406,I ordered a medium as I am in most things and the sizing around was perfect but it was entirely too short!,23406,2
23406,"I'm a bit shocked because I'm only 5""2",23406,2
23407,Not what I expected quality wise,23407,2
23408,This product was smaller than expected and did not fit!,23408,2
23409,"Washed these according to directions, in cold and inside out, dried on medium but the shirt shrunk.",23409,2
23409,The hem line shrunk up about 2 inches.,23409,2
23409,They still fit my son so we have kept them but defeats the purpose of sizing up so we can get more wear out of them.,23409,2
23409,"I have bought Leveret PJ's for my kids since they were infants and I have never had an issue with shrinkage, only fading.",23409,2
23409,Don't think I'll be buying them again since it appears that the quality has changed.,23409,2
23410,I normally wear an extra small or small so I figured I would be ok with the medium.,23410,2
23410,"When I opened it up my fiance said, ""is that a medium for kids?""",23410,2
23410,Needless to say it didn't fit.,23410,2
23410,"I am 5'4"" and 114 lbs.",23410,2
23411,I used the size chart and still ended up with a dress that was too small.,23411,2
23411,It looked like it was for a 12 year old girl.,23411,2
23411,Not pleased.,23411,2
23411,The quality was not great either.,23411,2
23412,They don't give sizing info so I guessed and guessed wrong.,23412,2
23412,"This will be great,  I think,  I just won't know for several months.",23412,2
23413,I guess you get what you pay for.,23413,2
23413,This too forever to get to me and fits very small and cheap material,23413,2
23414,I wear an 11..,23414,2
23414,I purchased an 11 and I can't even get my foot in the shoe..,23414,2
23414,"I've never worn a size 12 in my life, but I'd clearly have to with these.",23414,2
23414,This is a $40 shoe that will now most likely sit in my closet and collect dust.,23414,2
23415,too small,23415,2
23416,It is cute but not a dress more like a shirt,23416,2
23417,The glue sucks!,23417,2
23418,Sizing is misleading.,23418,2
23419,Could buy these from rainbow anywhere.,23419,2
23419,Nothing special,23419,2
23420,Is OK  looks a bit on the cheap side,23420,2
23421,"Way to big, open on sides.",23421,2
23421,If I had known I wouldn't have ordered it.,23421,2
23422,"Very comfy, but the zipper comes unzipped very easily while working out and gives NO support.",23422,2
23422,I would use it for yoga but not for high intensity workouts as the description says.,23422,2
23423,"Fit is ok. Definitely no support for breasts, but thankfully I don't need much.",23423,2
23423,Tough to get on though and I was expecting beading so very disappointed to receive a colored pattern of fabric as front and back.,23423,2
23423,I suppose you get why you pay for...,23423,2
23424,"Too boxy and the top was oddly shaped, like the person/ machine  sewing it went haywire.",23424,2
23424,"Not a great top, but it was cheap so it seemed like too much of a hassle to return.",23424,2
23424,I just donated the top.,23424,2
23425,The lace in the back didn't match up and the material wasn't what it looks like in the picture.,23425,2
23425,I want to return it but there is no return label.,23425,2
23426,Pretty much what the picture shows except that the two small upper stones are quite a bit lighter then shown in the picture.,23426,2
23426,I'm happy with the looks for the price.,23426,2
23426,It's cute and she liked it!!,23426,2
23426,So what could go wrong?,23426,2
23426,Big warning and the reason why it gets 2 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that it does not fit the Pandora Bead clasp.,23426,2
23426,The hole is just a little too small to fit over the clasping mechanism.,23426,2
23426,To me this is simply either poor workmanship and Q/A or bad design as many people buying this are intending to have fit one of the very popular Pandora bracelets.,23426,2
23426,Imagine the disappointment.,23426,2
23426,If the NinaQueen people read this I hope they make adjustments to their product.,23426,2
23427,"i have been using them for almost 2 months while moving around the kitchen and the living room and they were nice and comfortable but now they look good from the outside but the inside are very old like i am using them for years :-\...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deecoo-Premium-Cotton-Warm-Indoor-House-Winter-Slipper-9-10-D-M-US-B-Gray/dp/B016RSX97Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deecoo Premium Cotton Warm Indoor House Winter Slipper (9-10 D(M) US, B:Gray</a>",23427,2

23429,It messed up my back,23429,2
23430,I had to return this as it looked fake but may not have been... regardless I did not like it.,23430,2
23430,Great support and easy return,23430,2
23431,The quality of the fabric was low and it's a struggle to clasp.,23431,2
23431,"I went with a large (though am a 34B in America), it was still a little tight.",23431,2
23431,"Even worse, the fabric doesn't stretch at all, so it restricts my breathing.",23431,2
23431,It honestly felt like a chore to breath while wearing that thing.,23431,2
23431,"There is no rubbery lining on the inside, so it slips down a lot, and the straps it comes with frequently pop out of place.",23431,2
23431,I don't like it and wouldn't recommend it.,23431,2
23431,It's only good side was that it was cheap.,23431,2
23431,You get what you pay for.,23431,2

23432,"I would have loved this suit, very cute, but it was really short in the body area.",23432,2
23432,If you have a short torso this will work for you.,23432,2
23432,Mine also came with a tear in it.,23432,2
23433,"Maybe it's my baby's unusually large feet and thin ankles, but these fall off constantly - with no help from her at all!",23433,2
23433,They are also tough to get on because of where the velcro is placed; almost like they were constructed backwards.,23433,2
23433,"The footbeds don't seem to fit well inside the boot after washing, either.",23433,2
23433,I suppose for the price these are what you'd expect but I was hoping to get lucky.,23433,2
23434,"Quality seems fine, but fit much too baggy, so mine will be going to
goodwill",23434,2
23435,much smaller than I expected as it only holds six reg cigs.,23435,2
23435,"It is not worth the money it cost, it's not sturdy.",23435,2
23436,cheap material and very long bottom for a taller gayl,23436,2

23438,I ordered a large and these barely fit over my butt (2 inches and the top hung out).,23438,2
23438,I would have had to order a XXL.,23438,2
23438,Seller should edit the sizing chart to reflect asian sizing.,23438,2

23439,"The large fit my body, but provided no support in the chest (I'm a C cup for reference).",23439,2
23439,"After wearing it once I realized that if I did anything more than lay by the pool, the top would shift leaving my chest exposed.",23439,2
23439,I'm not going to bother returning it as someone else said the shipping alone to return it is worth more than the suit.,23439,2
23439,"Maybe if you are flat chested, this suit will work for you.",23439,2
23440,Very tight when it says stretch.,23440,2
23440,need to return.,23440,2
23441,"It's a pretty color, and the material feels nice, but it was smaller than expected.",23441,2
23441,"I will hold onto and give away, but will not order again.",23441,2
23442,"Some of the ""touch enabled"" areas of the fingers are not touch responsive.",23442,2
23442,The gloves however feel warm and comfortable and look nice.,23442,2
23443,I bought the 12-18 months size for my son's 1st birthday.,23443,2
23443,He currently wears size 12 months in Carters with plenty of room to grow.,23443,2
23443,He is about 23 pounds and we always joke about his short legs (he takes after my side of the family here).,23443,2
23443,"While this outfit is very cute, it is not functional at all.",23443,2
23443,The arms and torso fit him on the large/baggy side while the legs were way too short even on his stubby little legs.,23443,2
23443,The crotch kept popping open whenever he sat down or stood up or crawled or walked...so basically it was open all the time.,23443,2
23443,I even took his diaper off and STILL the darn thing kept popping open!,23443,2
23443,"Since I waited until the last minute to order something for his bday photo shoot, I was stuck with this thing.",23443,2
23443,"His popped open crotch ruined a lot of really cute shots and was tolerable, at best, in several others.",23443,2
23443,I don't see how this could work for any child out there that is proportioned normally or with long legs.,23443,2
23443,I would have returned it if I had time to find something else.,23443,2
23444,I can't really complain because the product description doesn't specify the material but I assumed it would be cotton or a blend.,23444,2
23444,The actual material is closer to a workout shirt.,23444,2
23444,I don't care for it but that's just my opinion.,23444,2
23445,"It's pretty, but the fabric is not as fluid as it looks on the picture, it's a bit ruff on my skin, especially neck.",23445,2
23445,"Also, there was a black dot on the front that didn't come off (ink?)",23445,2
23445,"I had no time for return hassle, as I'm going on vacation in Cancun in 2 days.",23445,2
23446,I bought a larger size thinking that it would end up fitting me.,23446,2
23446,Tried it on when it came in the mail and it runs very small.,23446,2
23447,Only 2 of the six pairs actually had grippers.,23447,2
23448,"Cute, it would have not fit my baby's head.",23448,2
23448,Lol it fits me!,23448,2
23449,Runs small not good quality,23449,2
23450,"It's very adorable, however I ordered a 0-3 month and received a 12 month.",23450,2
23450,Just have to wait awhile before we can wear it.,23450,2
23451,I returned them.,23451,2
23451,"These pants had an odd fit, wide waist and very narrow thigh.",23451,2
23451,You must have a thigh gap to wear these.,23451,2
23451,I usually wear a size 6 or 8.,23451,2
23451,I ordered an 8 and couldn't get them on.,23451,2
23451,"I don't think I could wear these, no matter what size I tried.",23451,2
23452,I got a XXL and it was like at most a M. No stretch and poorly made.,23452,2
23453,cheaply made.,23453,2
23454,I bought this with my husband account and was disappoint.,23454,2
23454,Too big and low quality.,23454,2
23455,The shirt is adorable but way small.,23455,2
23455,I am 5'5 and it barely went past my belly button.,23455,2
23455,But if I ordered bigger it would not have fit well.,23455,2
23455,All in all disappointing.,23455,2
23456,Quality was not as good as expected.,23456,2
23456,Also did not fit my husband (larger dude).,23456,2
23457,I bought this for my granddaughter and it didn't even stay together for 15 min.,23457,2
23457,The little bear was not attached securely.,23457,2
23457,It is very cute and she did love it.,23457,2
23458,"Color, design and fit not the same as picture.",23458,2
23459,This is tiny.,23459,2
23459,Feels like it was made for a doll.,23459,2
23460,"Color is brighter than I expected, the material sticks to the body.",23460,2
23460,"So, my wife didn't like the fit.",23460,2
23460,"So, I am returning it.",23460,2
23461,I ordered a size 8 based on reviews that it runs small.,23461,2
23461,My daughter is a size 5/6 and after one wash the pajamas are very snug on her.,23461,2
23461,I expected this pajamas to last her at least 2 years.,23461,2
23461,"It doesn't look like it, which is too bad because it's a very cute pajamas",23461,2
23462,I couldn't do anything with it.,23462,2
23462,Very small,23462,2
23463,I ordered an XL and I am a Medium and it's still too small.,23463,2
23463,Cheaply made.,23463,2
23464,"the image was nice, but the pad was too thin.",23464,2
23464,wish it was made with a bit more quality,23464,2
23465,This is a beautiful piece but it came to me broken!!,23465,2
23465,!,23465,2
23466,POlyester too hot...compared to cotton.,23466,2
23466,Doesn't matter if it's breathable,23466,2
23467,I bought these leggings for a costume.,23467,2
23467,Color and fabric were as pictured/expected.,23467,2
23467,I am disappointed to note that the leggings got two runs in them (one in the crotch and one on the butt) just from me putting them on.,23467,2
23467,"I am not overweight and I was being gentle with the leggings but as soon as I pulled them up, they ripped :(  Unfortunately I did not have enough time to buy another pair for my costume and had to cover up the rips to wear them in public.",23467,2
23467,I was very happy with accuracy of color but very unhappy with quality.,23467,2
23468,"While this is a very nice looking bag, the smell is horrendous - still lingering many weeks after purchase - and the quality leaves a lot to be desired.",23468,2
23468,"The very first time I carried this bag, one of the decorative studs fell off and was lost.",23468,2
23468,Leaving THREE holes in the bag.,23468,2
23468,Scarleton customer service was quick to reply but could not provide a replacement stud and offered no exchange.,23468,2
23468,"Amazon customer service, refunded my purchase (thankfully) but I will not buy this brand again.",23468,2
23469,Did not fit as expected and delivered with the black color bleeding into the beige color on the dress.,23469,2
23470,Wrinkles would not come out..was too large .,23470,2
23471,"This fit about 1-2 sizes small, the material was alot thick then i expected is has a fuzzy warm feeling underneath",23471,2
23472,Too small couldn't fit,23472,2
23473,"I loved the looks of this bag straight out of the package and ""moved"" into it right away.",23473,2
23473,Unfortunately my pleasure was dashed by noticing that after carrying this bag for less than 12 hours the zipper on the inside pocket is coming loose.,23473,2
23473,We are currently traveling so I hope it holds until we get home.,23473,2
23473,One of my favorite things about the bag was all the cool hardware but it has started to tarnish :( So sad about it because it is very cute.,23473,2
23474,I ordered an XL after looking at sizing chart.,23474,2
23474,When I got it it was more like a little girls size!,23474,2
23475,"Way to big how could anyone  fit into it, however it was of outstanding quality.",23475,2
23476,These leggings were a huge disappointment.,23476,2
23476,"They fit so weird, it was like not made for a human person.",23476,2
23476,"I am 5'7"" and 125 pounds and it fit so small but then big in other places, I tried to do yoga in them and my butt crack showed the whole time.",23476,2
23476,Definitely cheaply made.,23476,2
23477,Not like the picture,23477,2
23478,"This should never be marketed towards men, because it's much to small.",23478,2
23478,"Women (with small wrists) and children yes, men no",23478,2
23479,Large.,23479,2
23479,"It's very pretty, but mine came with a stone out so I can't wear it.",23479,2
23479,It was so inexpensive that I just kept it.,23479,2
23479,Wish it had been perfect so I could have used it.,23479,2
23479,Hopefully I can repair the stone.,23479,2
23480,I didn't expect much for the price.,23480,2
23480,"I think the fit is actually okay, but the material is very thin and it's made very poorly.",23480,2
23480,The seams were already pulling apart straight out of the package and the sequins were frayed and falling off.,23480,2
23480,"The dress I received was not made like the picture, it has a ruched panel across the tummy area in the front but it was not draped like the picture.",23480,2
23480,Also no ruching on the back and the white material was very sheer-not sure what you could wear underneath to make this work.,23480,2
23480,Sadly I returned it.,23480,2
23481,Flattering for tummy but breast area is too small and see through.,23481,2
23481,You can see the removable padding through the whites of the bikini.,23481,2
23482,Was too small,23482,2
23483,Material is wooly.,23483,2
23483,Too small.,23483,2
23484,The straps are short and the seams are coming a part I should have returned it,23484,2
23485,Says its made with 316 surgical steel when in fact they are plastic.,23485,2
23486,The necklace is cute but oh man does it tangle.,23486,2
23486,It rolls constantly during the day and gets super tangled and wrapped together.,23486,2
23486,I have to take it off a few times a day to straighten it out.,23486,2
23486,"It also gets tangled up in your hair, ouch!",23486,2
23486,All in all it was a good price but just doesnt seem to work right for me.,23486,2
23487,"I am a size 8, can't even get into the skirt and the top is tight.",23487,2
23487,Going to give it to my size 1 bestfriend.,23487,2
23488,"T-shirt material, cheap and wrinkled beyond wrinkle.",23488,2
23489,It's made out of cheap fabric.,23489,2
23489,It's not warm enough for my son to wear in the winter.,23489,2
23489,When I washed it the red bleed onto the gray.,23489,2
23490,Wife didn't like the style.,23490,2
23491,This is meant for petite women.,23491,2
23491,I'm a new momma.,23491,2
23491,I have a momma bust and a momma waist.,23491,2
23491,"Naturally, I am a size bigger than i was before I had my child, so I ordered an XL, reading the measurements.",23491,2
23491,"The fabric is SUPER SOFT, for starters and made quite nicely.",23491,2
23491,It just hugs the hips and the girls.,23491,2
23491,"You could totally tell when you're ""cold"" and you can see the ""momma chub"" and the outline of the belly button when wearing it.",23491,2
23491,"Cute shirt though, just not for my body type.",23491,2
23492,They're kind of see through..,23492,2
23493,It was made very well.,23493,2
23493,Good material but runs very small so I could not fit it.,23493,2
23493,I was so disappointed with the proportions,23493,2
23494,"Look just like they fit, tiny",23494,2
23495,"Had to return this, very cute shirt but the front is too short, definitely not as pictured.",23495,2
23496,Will not fit nipples,23496,2
23497,Could not get over my hand.,23497,2
23498,Top was a bit big and the bottom is way too small.,23498,2
23498,"It's nice fabric and print, just wish I could actually wear it.",23498,2
23499,Came in a pack of 4.,23499,2
23499,2 pair fit OK (solid colors).,23499,2
23499,"The rest didn't fit at all (pattern) the brand name was ""no boundrys"" and I think that is a walmart brand.",23499,2
23499,Couldn't be too upset it was cheap.,23499,2
23499,Cheap quality.,23499,2
23500,"Extremely cheaply made,get what you pay for.",23500,2
23500,I wore this shirt yesterday for about 5 hours already somehow has a hole at the bottom of my arm.,23500,2
23501,It is a very good shirt.....,23501,2
23502,Poor quality.,23502,2
23502,The materials shrank at different rate.,23502,2
23503,"Very disappointed,, I needed this to recup after surgery around the house.",23503,2
23504,I really expected to love these glasses.,23504,2
23504,Everyone who posted pictures look good in these glasses.,23504,2
23504,"Sadly, I look like a wierdo.",23504,2
23504,These shades are just strange all the way around.,23504,2
23504,"They'll be good for hanging out by my pool but outside of that, they are NOT ever going to be favorites of mine.",23504,2
23505,The cotton is a heavy fabric and I have a tiny waist so most all dresses fit me perfectly.,23505,2
23505,"I saved this for a special dinner and had i known it would make my belly look pregnant, I would have returned it, but too late.",23505,2
23506,Shrinks a lot.,23506,2
23506,A whole lot.,23506,2
23506,A bit flimsy,23506,2
23507,Was all one piece at the top with stupid round padding and plastic strips that do nothing to flatter a big chested women I thought it would actually criss cross across my chest still might send it back I odered it 2 sizes too big and it barely fit color is nice,23507,2
23508,The top was more of a smoker stained yellow color.,23508,2
23508,The skirt is MUCH shorter ten the picture shows and the top fits very strangely it doesn't lay nicely.,23508,2
23508,I was disappointed I just ended up using the skirt over my leggings and the head scarf.,23508,2
23509,This was very tight with no slit in the back.,23509,2
23509,Makes walking difficult.,23509,2
23510,I like it,23510,2
23511,The picture is very misleading!,23511,2
23511,Each color shows the rings in a SET of TWO!,23511,2
23512,The actual stones were nice but the clasp was non-functional,23512,2
23513,The quality of the lace and beading is not the best.,23513,2
23513,It feels and looks rough.,23513,2
23513,It also runs too small.,23513,2
23513,The rest of the dress is fine.,23513,2
23513,It is dowble lined and sturdy.,23513,2
23514,Coating peeled off.,23514,2
23515,It is cute but it doesn't close easily.,23515,2
23515,My 7 yr old used his money to buy it and he liked it until he couldn't open or close it easily by himself.,23515,2
23515,"You really have to pull hard to open it and then to close/clasp if you have to make sure it is even on the top and bottom, which isn't easy and the you have to push it together real hard and at the same time make sure the top and bottom stay even.",23515,2
23516,I honestly was not expecting this to be so tiny.,23516,2
23516,The photo makes it look large and chunky which is what I was going for.,23516,2
23516,The bracelet is overall very thin.,23516,2
23517,This is labeled as a skater dress like others but this one has a seam at the waste making it much less comfortable.,23517,2
23517,(Rob's wife),23517,2
23518,The hairband never really stayed in the grooves.,23518,2
23518,"And whenever the hair tie wasn't on the bracelet, the bracelet was awkwardly large and would constantly turn on my wrist, pinching my tendons.",23518,2
23519,The material does not hold well,23519,2
23520,I got it without the closure hook,23520,2
23521,"The plunge is very deep
Be prepared for lots of cleavage",23521,2
23522,The top did not fit as expected.,23522,2
23523,I ordered a small and is way too large... One of the seams was ripped...,23523,2
23523,I'm returning this item..,23523,2
23524,Much to tight threw the body,23524,2
23525,I purchased to go along with my Alex and Ani bracelets.,23525,2
23525,This is a chrome color bracelet and the tags are not dark as pictured.,23525,2
23525,They are also a chrome.,23525,2
23525,So I am returning the 2 bracelets I purchased.,23525,2
23525,Nice if you are Not hopiing to wear with the Alex and Ani  simular bracelets.,23525,2
23525,Purchased to give to two Alex and Ani bracelet wearers to support my lymphoma cancer.,23525,2
23526,Update 5/2/17 I wore these gloves through the winter on days it was too warm for Thinsulate lined gloves (not daily).,23526,2
23526,I just discovered the hole between the left first and second fingers.,23526,2
23526,I wrote to Lundorf expressing my concern that this is not an expected wear pattern.,23526,2
23526,Their answer was for me to deal with Amazon because Amazon fulfilled the order.,23526,2
23526,I am outside the 31 day return window and so have a pair of unusable gloves plus a pair of unworn grey ones for summer which may also be too fragile for actual use.,23526,2
23526,I am not a happy camper As I expect companies to stand behind the quality of their products.,23526,2
23526,Also HiPo Steve's wife writing this message.,23526,2
23526,Nicest pair of gloves I have owned in decades.,23526,2
23526,HiPo Steve's wife writing this.,23526,2
23526,I have been wearing them constantly for a week now.,23526,2
23526,Great fit for my hands with long fingers and they cover the wrist.,23526,2
23526,Nice leather.,23526,2
23526,Excellent workmanship.,23526,2
23526,I ordered 4 pair in different colors.,23526,2
23526,Kept the Black and Grey ones.,23526,2
23526,Sent the Ivory and Petrol back.,23526,2
23526,Would have kept the Petrol (gorgeous blue/green) but they were too small (boxed as size 8 but label inside glove was 7).,23526,2
23526,I may reorder the Petrol.,23526,2
23526,Refund on returns was prompt.,23526,2
23527,These sweaters are amazing.,23527,2
23527,"They are great quality, soft, and don't fade after washing - I love the ones I have ordered in other colors.",23527,2
23527,"That being said - I have ordered the Mustard-colored sweater TWICE - both times I asked for an XL, and both times I was sent a size Small.",23527,2
23527,So I guess ordering sizes is a lottery - you never know what they will actually send.,23527,2
23527,"If you get lucky and you actually receive the correct size, you win!",23527,2
23528,This dress is not as chic as in the photo.,23528,2
23528,Looks cheap worn.,23528,2
23528,The knotting at the side falls to the middle on the actual dress and the skirt portion is much shorter than what you'd expect from the photo.,23528,2
23528,The material is also very thin making the dress somewhat see through.,23528,2
23529,Doesn't slouch.,23529,2
23530,Super cute outfit..but once she wore it all day the strings started coming out of the outfit from all over the place ..it will literally start to unravel along with the elastic parts!!,23530,2
23530,Was super disappointed because this outfit is so adorable ..it is made very poorly..update we had to throw it away after one time wear and one wash ..all the ruffles unravled including the bottom part.was super bummed update: they sent me a knew one free of charge.,23530,2
23530,They were very noce about it.,23530,2
23531,2 stones fell out before I even wore them.,23531,2
23532,I ordered a large and it is about a size 0,23532,2
23533,The quality of the dress is what I expected it to be.,23533,2
23533,The correct color as advertised and the bandage material as expected (thick & with good stretch).,23533,2
23533,Unfortunately the dress came with stained line running through the chest area very noticeable looks like it had been folded for a long time.,23533,2
23533,I am returning it and ordering a new one hoping I don't run into the same issue or worse.,23533,2
23533,Why would the dress be mailed with a stain?,23533,2
23533,The line that looks like a shadow is actually the stained line and it is very noticeable.,23533,2
23533,I need the dress for Saturday flying to a party in the east coast.,23533,2
23534,This hoodie was way too small.,23534,2
23535,It is very cute but it is way too high in the back.,23535,2
23536,cheap looking and not of good quality,23536,2
23537,"Bought this belly ring, and it was stunning upon opening the package!",23537,2
23537,"However, the middle stone fell out within 24 hours of wearing.",23537,2
23537,The whole dangle portion fell off withing 48 hours of wearing.,23537,2
23537,"Dissapointed in the product, NOT worth the price.",23537,2
23538,Thought these would be thicker and maybe appropriate without something covering your butt..,23538,2
23538,I was wrong.,23538,2
23538,They are skin tight even when I sized up.,23538,2
23538,Be prepared to leave nothing to the imagination.,23538,2
23539,I got this bra in black and white.,23539,2
23539,"I'm a slender 5'5"" with an A cup and these were hard to get on.",23539,2
23539,"When they were on, the straps creep up awkwardly and pinch a little in the armpit area.",23539,2
23539,The black fabric is okay...you can't see through it.,23539,2
23539,The white fabric is as thin as tissue paper and you can see EVERYTHING.,23539,2
23539,"Overall, ok for $5 but I'd invest more on a sturdier and more comfortable bra.",23539,2
23540,"For me this was a very awkward fit tight in the legs loose in hips almost baggy, very strange i'm not sure if it would look better on someone taller i am 5'5.",23540,2
23541,When I put this on it did not look like the photo.,23541,2
23541,Disappointing because I really liked the silhouette of this dress.,23541,2
23542,Beautiful shoe.,23542,2
23542,My saughter wears an 8.5 and I bought the 9 hoping she'd be able to  wear them a while.,23542,2
23542,"However, they are too small.",23542,2
23542,I have a hard time getting her feet in but I need them for a wedding in 6 days so I am hoping she can break them in and make them tolerable for that day.,23542,2
23542,Really disappointed in sizing.,23542,2
23543,This is beyond too small.,23543,2
23543,I don't even have words!,23543,2
23543,"I'm not overweight, but I do have big fake boobies.",23543,2
23543,I usually order a medium to a large.,23543,2
23543,I ordered the biggest size- XXL and I couldn't even get it on!,23543,2
23543,There is no stretch to the shirt or the sleeves so there is no wriggle room.,23543,2
23543,"On a positive note: it came much faster than expected (about a week) the peach color is very pretty, and the style is darling.",23543,2
23543,"It's just not made for an American woman, or any woman with boobs for that matter!",23543,2
23544,I got the asian 3xl but it fits like a us medium-large.,23544,2
23544,Its pretty tight around the arm pits.,23544,2
23544,If you are over 6 foot tall your arms probably won't fit when u stretch your arms out.,23544,2
23544,"Im 5'11 and 200lbs and its a little tight, if you're bigger than me, get something else because 3xl is their largest size lol",23544,2
23545,Runs way small... item does not even look like what's pictured.,23545,2
23546,Very see through.,23546,2
23546,Will likely be returning this item.,23546,2
23547,Disappointed with this bag.,23547,2
23547,One zipper doesn't work and another zipper sticks.,23547,2
23548,Nice look as expected but not a snug fit unless you put at least 4 cards in.,23548,2
23548,Hard to put cards in.,23548,2
23548,Bought for my teenage son who has 1 credit card and his i.d.,23548,2
23548,Too loose.,23548,2
23548,If I shook it  the card fell out.,23548,2
23549,Not a fan and it took absolutely forever to get here.,23549,2
23549,By the time it got here I had bought a different one to wear.,23549,2
23550,Is very nice but it run too small...,23550,2
23551,This bag is not like leather at all.,23551,2
23551,It is more plastic than anything.,23551,2
23551,I ended up returning this product.,23551,2
23552,SHORT.,23552,2
23552,Use it as a sweater with skirts.,23552,2
23552,"Bulky, not flattering, and did I mention it's short.",23552,2
23552,"The waist, bust and arms fit fine.",23552,2
23552,Usually have great luck buying on line as I read and then reread descriptions and ratings.,23552,2
23552,Bombed on this on.,23552,2
23552,"Will keep it and use it as a top for the winter (yup, it's warm if nothing else).",23552,2
23553,Not as pictured.,23553,2
23553,"It's a woman's blouse, gave it to my girlfriend.",23553,2
23554,bad bad...I don't like the quality,23554,2
23555,Way too small....,23555,2
23556,"It was hard to decided which size to get based on the reviews but I'm only 5'4"" 115lbs so I decided to get a small.",23556,2
23556,Boy I was wrong the bottom went so far up my butt that it became a thing.,23556,2
23556,I like how the suit looks so I will return for a medium,23556,2
23557,I did the bend test and you could see straight through!,23557,2
23558,Pockets are too tight.,23558,2
23558,More than one credit card in a pocket is very difficult to pull out.,23558,2
23559,Purchased the 3-5 year old size for our 3 year old and the fit is so tight around the wrist we can barely get them on.,23559,2
23559,Then when they are on he has a very difficult time getting his fingers into the individual finger slots.,23559,2
23559,We try and bribe to get him to put them on and he refuses.,23559,2
23559,He ends up with multiple fingers in one slot and gets tired of wearing them after 5 minutes.,23559,2
23560,"I ordered a size larger to be safe and its still too tight, cheap material & not anywhere near worth the $25 for this!",23560,2
23561,Was long but too small in the waist....,23561,2
23562,I gave this product 2 stars only because he sizing is so far off...,23562,2
23562,I normally wear an XL and sometimes even just a L.  I ordered XXL in these based on the data indicating that they ran very small... WOW... they weren't kidding!!,23562,2
23562,Even with a XXL these things nearly cut off my circulation they were so tight.,23562,2
23562,I know they are supposed to fit tight but this was ridiculous.,23562,2
23562,I had no issue with the quality of the product but the sizing is WAY off!,23562,2
23562,!,23562,2
23563,See through and very tight,23563,2
23564,This is a nice classic pea coat but was too tight around the shoulders and arms.,23564,2
23564,"Also, it was a bit too short for what I was looking for.",23564,2
23564,It was sent back.,23564,2
23565,the color is not the same,23565,2
23566,feel lopsided when you wear them  and very stiff,23566,2
23567,this hat is too small.,23567,2
23567,It does not fit well on my head.,23567,2
23568,This product runs really really small.,23568,2
23568,I ordered up like three sizes and it was still too small.,23568,2
23568,I ended up giving it away.,23568,2
23568,It is really cute though and I like that it's different from most vests in the length department,23568,2
23569,"For the price, the satin quality is disappointing.",23569,2
23569,I was expecting a silk satin as opposed to polyester.,23569,2
23569,I also found the drawstring awkward to tie.,23569,2
23570,If you are a D cup this tank won't cover very much.,23570,2
23570,So as a built in bra it will not be comfortable.,23570,2
23570,If you are a C and smaller im sure it would be a better fit.,23570,2
23570,The built in bra is narrow.,23570,2
23571,"Kept rolling down and pressing uncomfortably on my mid-section, exactly where I didn't ant pressure.",23571,2
23571,I returned it.,23571,2
23572,The elastic stretches & makes it too loose on the foot with not much support.,23572,2
23573,Sizes are not accurate.,23573,2
23573,XL is like a size 8 and I don't think they understand what breasts are.,23573,2
23574,The swing quality was bad and they missed sewing part of the seam right in front.,23574,2
23575,The strap ripped so easily when I was taking the strap off of the velcro.,23575,2
23575,I got disappointed fast because I can't wear ripped underwear.,23575,2
23575,:(,23575,2
23576,This product would be perfect if it had more stretch and the hips were bigger.,23576,2
23576,I am 5' 9 - size 28-29 pant and I could not get the strings over my hips.,23576,2
23576,Runs very small.,23576,2
23577,It was somewhat ok,23577,2
23578,"the jacket is very small and the fabric is not good quality, sorry",23578,2
23579,It came with detached tagging and labels.,23579,2
23580,too shiny and small,23580,2
23581,"I just got it today: The texture and design of it are great, the mat black feels nice and they look good, however as soon as I got it out of the package and tried to put it on part of the earring broke, so I can't secure it, and the other one didn't break but fell right of my ear.. hopefully I can super or hot glue to fix it... that was really disappointing.",23581,2
23581,"(Also, there is a copyright DC on the inner side of the each of the bats, if that makes any difference for you.)",23581,2
23582,These pants are smaller than expected which means even if you order a size larger they may still be too small.,23582,2
23582,In addition to fit my pants started to unravel at some of the seems after the first wash.,23582,2
23583,"Very long dress, and very staticky!!",23583,2
23583,"The waist line is very high as well, wish it was a bit lower to be more flattering.",23583,2
23583,But the skirt portion is super static prone and clings like crazy!,23583,2
23583,!,23583,2
23584,Cheap,23584,2
23585,It was not made right.,23585,2
23585,the bottom of the shirt was cut way too narrow for an x-large,23585,2
23586,No different than a $30 laptop bag.,23586,2
23586,Smaller too.,23586,2
23586,Save money and just repurpose one.,23586,2
23586,Only feature that's beyond a laptop bag is the stroller hooks.,23586,2
23586,Yay!,23586,2
23586,Realistically it won't hold all the basic stuff your going to need if your going to be taking your child out longer than an hour.,23586,2
23586,Way too small for the real world parents,23586,2
23587,I liked the skirt style and color and the length was perfect.,23587,2
23587,The product was shipped to me in good timing as well.,23587,2
23587,However my only issue was that there was not enough material.,23587,2
23587,"I wore this skirt to my bridal shower and thank God I grew up knowing what a slip was because the skirt was see thru and even with the slip on it was see thru, but not as bad without it.",23587,2
23587,It did not have enough layers or thick enough material.,23587,2
23587,For that reason is why I gave this product a low rating.,23587,2
23588,It was too small can only fit a six yrs old girl,23588,2
23589,"These are great in terms of warmth, but I'm 5'4"" and generally don't find many products that are so short.",23589,2
23590,Nice but packaging was lacking because product came tangled and I still haven't been able to untangle it!,23590,2
23591,I loved  this little bracelet  for my daughter & I just for fun.,23591,2
23591,It lasted maybe 1 month and turned green n finally broke.,23591,2
23591,I would probably buy again just because  they are cheap and so cute.,23591,2
23592,Very see through,23592,2
23593,Was disappointed because the colors are NOT AT ALL like the ones pictured :( every pair is pretty much transparent except the white and black...,23593,2
23593,"I already had light/transparent ones and was hoping these would be more bold, like pictured :(",23593,2
23594,Way too big.,23594,2
23594,The 6M is more like 12M so had to return it.,23594,2
23594,Otherwise the colors are nice and bright.,23594,2
23595,"Smaller than what I expected,  cheap material",23595,2
23596,Returned fits very small,23596,2
23597,junk,23597,2
23598,WAS NOT AN XL.,23598,2
23598,"HAT WAS MARKED SM/MED
ALSO WAS NOT PLEASED W/ THE QUALITY.",23598,2
23598,I RETURNED THE ITEM,23598,2
23599,Some of the bones had paper on them and when I took the paper off it removed some of the paint.,23599,2
23599,"The torso of this jumpsuit is very short, I'm 5'2"" and well proportioned, but the pelvic bones came to my navel and the patella was on my thighs.",23599,2
23599,It's an ok costume.,23599,2
23600,The clasp mechanism fell apart after one week.,23600,2
23600,It couldn't be repaired.,23600,2
23601,Way too much side boob.,23601,2
23601,The black doesn't cover it the right way.,23601,2
23601,36D bought XL.,23601,2
23602,Break easily.,23602,2
23602,I find it best to sheath them in a fold BIGGER than the case that come with them,23602,2
23603,"The material was like a low count bed sheet...this was not what I expected, but it was not worth returning.",23603,2
23603,One of the few Amazon purchases I'm not thrilled with...,23603,2
23604,I wasn't a fan of the material at all and it was too small.,23604,2
23605,"I love the shirt, but my XL fits like a Med.",23605,2
23606,I totally got suckered by what looked like a really cool print when I bought this.,23606,2
23606,"First off, the fabric is about as cheap as you can get - it's like parachute fabric.",23606,2
23606,"secondly, there is NO fit whatsoever to this dress - it's pretty much a sack with a strip of fabric attached to it to be used as a belt - and it looks like it.",23606,2
23606,"In reality the color is totally different, not modern at all.",23606,2
23606,This is one of those things that looks cute online... until you get it.,23606,2
23606,Be warned.,23606,2
23607,Had to return this.,23607,2
23607,"I am almost 5'9"" and the bust line was too high.",23607,2
23607,You would need a really long torso and high bustling to make this fit.,23607,2
23607,Very disappointed.,23607,2
23608,A little too large and heavy.,23608,2
23609,Cheap quality,23609,2
23610,"I ordered an extra small, but it fits like a large.",23610,2
23610,I guess the dress is made for tall people with more prominent curves because it is a lot larger in the hips/bust parts of the dress.,23610,2
23611,"The quality of the rosary is good, but I purchased 2 at the same time and they are completely different in size, one is really small and one is normal size but they're supposed to be matching",23611,2
23612,I'm usually a small or extra small but I ordered the medium based on the other reviews - it was still too small.,23612,2
23612,"Not flattering - doesn't look at all like the picture - Waistband is too short to fold over, and it bunches up at the seam.",23612,2
23613,I got the black and white because they look so cute in photos.,23613,2
23613,When I got them I was disappointed in how cheap they look.,23613,2
23613,The elastic on the wrist is awful and it looks cheap.,23613,2
23613,"The material smells odd even post wash.

Not trying to be overly picky,  I wanted something fun to wear this summer on nights out.",23613,2
23613,Ended up being loved by my teenage daughter so they didn't go to waste.,23613,2
23614,Not what I expected; short for my size,23614,2
23615,Too large and cheaply made,23615,2
23616,I ordered my usual size 8 but these are too long.,23616,2
23616,"They have a lot of room in the toe box, which is what I look for, but with over an inch extra in the length it caused my feet to slide back and forth.",23616,2
23616,Also the insole seemed a bit off.,23616,2
23616,The arch support started too close to the heal pressing in at a spot that made my feet cramp up.,23616,2
23616,I was hoping to get the same support as my Vionic sandals.,23616,2
23616,They are cute though and light weight.,23616,2
23616,"Oh, and I should have paid more attention to shipping.",23616,2
23616,I'm paying almost $20.00 ($10 each way) to try one pair of shoes which I'm not keeping.,23616,2
23616,"May be better to try them on at a store first and when you find the right fit, go online to find the best deal.",23616,2
23617,wallet colour keep rubbing off in pocket,23617,2
23618,You get what you pay for.,23618,2
23618,'nut said.,23618,2
23619,I thought they would be crew sock-like material but they were very elastic looking.,23619,2
23619,"Also, my legs are on the short side so these come all the way up to my crotch.",23619,2
23619,I don't find that attractive.,23619,2
23619,The tips also roll on these.,23619,2
23619,"Meaning, if you're moving around, expect them to start rolling down and looking weird.",23619,2
23619,"I'm thinking maybe if my thighs were thicker, they may not do that but that's something I'll never know.",23619,2
23620,Decent Phone Case For The Price.,23620,2
23621,Not a great fit at all.,23621,2
23621,"It is soft, just too large for my son.",23621,2
23622,"Cute shirt, but as soon as you lift your arms at all, the elastic band moves up to your neck and it looks ridiculous.",23622,2
23623,I know Asian sizes tend to run small but the shirt was VERY small.,23623,2
23623,I normally like the blouses I wear it work to be loose.,23623,2
23623,"I'm 5'7"" and 165lbs.",23623,2
23623,A size large in most blouses is roomy enough for my comfort.,23623,2
23623,I ordered a 2XL & couldn't even get it over my head.,23623,2
23623,I'm glad it didn't cost much.,23623,2
23624,"It's cute, BUT no correct information!",23624,2
23624,It isn't 100% cotton.,23624,2
23624,"It's 65% Polyester, 35% Cotton.",23624,2
23624,I'll send it back.,23624,2
23625,"The fabric is too thin , you can see through it , it is of poor quality.",23625,2
23625,"I did not like it , I can not wear it .",23625,2
23625,The only nice bright colors are beautiful .,23625,2
23626,ORDER A SIZE SMALLER (at least).,23626,2
23626,"If these fit, they'd be superb.",23626,2
23626,"Nice grippy soles, easy to slip on.",23626,2
23626,Just too darn big.,23626,2
23627,They worked just fine for the first month of school.,23627,2
23627,Then slowly bulbs started to go out.,23627,2
23627,Now they won't light up at all.,23627,2
23627,I guess it was good while it lasted.,23627,2
23627,She was really happy for that time when her shoes would light up now she just wears them because she likes the color blue!,23627,2
23628,Smells and feels like an inner tube on your body:(,23628,2
23629,"This suit was very cute, but the sizing was very off.",23629,2
23629,"I returned it, but was bummed it didn't work!",23629,2
23630,Looked nice online got it late and seems very cheaply made.,23630,2
23630,And the faces lol longer knock off emojis,23630,2
23631,This is pretty and even fit fairly well but the fabric is very sheer and very clingy so if you have curves or rolls you do not want to show to the world this is probably not the dress for you.,23631,2
23631,:(,23631,2
23632,This bag really looked cheap.,23632,2
23632,I returned it.,23632,2

23634,I measured my daughter and ordered the size according to their sizing chart.,23634,2
23634,It was WAY too small.,23634,2
23634,The tail portion is also very small.,23634,2
23634,I had to send it back.,23634,2
23635,I bought this for my 11 year old Goddaughter.,23635,2
23635,The sayings are very hard to read but she still lived it.,23635,2
23636,I ordered 1 size smaller in hopes that it would give me the support I needed.,23636,2
23636,It was still to big.,23636,2
23636,there is NO support at all.,23636,2

around the neck is absolutely useless.",23636,2

less expensive tankinis with better fabric and quality.",23636,2

23638,Had to give it to my daughter.,23638,2
23638,Very disappointing.,23638,2
23639,headband is a really cheap velcro material.,23639,2

23642,Im honestly very disappointed.,23642,2
23642,I just wished they got the colors right.,23642,2
23642,"I was expecting it to be ALL black... Anyways, to the point; I expected the colors of the bracelet to be the exact same color it is shown in the picture and described in the  description, ""Color - Black Synthetic Leather Bracelet"" and that's not what I got.",23642,2
23642,See picture below.,23642,2
23643,"Style of the hat is great; however, the material/straw cracks and breaks terribly.",23643,2
23644,The material was too flimsy to work with.,23644,2
23644,It just wasn't what I expected it to be.,23644,2
23645,Maybe runs small?,23645,2
23645,"Cuts in in all wrong places, and I thought it might be slightly higher to not create the ""muffin""...returning it",23645,2
23646,"Very cheap products, will not be purchasing again.",23646,2
23647,Had troubles with the breast area.,23647,2
23647,it is too tight.,23647,2
23648,Very nice studs; however the bar was to short for my Tragus and the ball on the back is difficult to screw on.,23648,2
23649,"It came earlier then I was expecting it which was great cause I was wanting it for a girl's trip.bad news it came and was not what I was expecting.the neck and hemline did not look like it should,sewing isn't great and the hemline shape is not like it should be like in the photos.",23649,2
23649,I just was really sad after having been excited for it to arrive.and I'm hoping it shrinks a bit cause it was a bit larger then I thought it'd be.,23649,2
23650,"size runs small, love the look.",23650,2
23651,My hisbamd has had this ring for two weeks.,23651,2
23651,We went shopping and when we got home one of the screws is gone already.,23651,2
23652,Socks droopy,23652,2
23653,Super cute and would have been great except it came with one finger loop missing.,23653,2
23653,Without the loop there isn't a way to keep the wing attached to your hand and it just hangs.,23653,2
23653,Otherwise the wings are great.,23653,2
23653,Easy costume.,23653,2
23653,"I am a size 20, 5'5"".",23653,2
23654,Not flexible.,23654,2
23654,Broke one immediately trying to get proper fit.,23654,2
23655,Look just like the picture but the XL is way to short for me and I am 5'4.,23655,2
23655,They are not cute as a mid calf capri but would fit a child!!,23655,2
23655,!,23655,2
23656,The flap is too small,23656,2
23657,It was bigger than I expected.,23657,2
23657,So I returned it.,23657,2
23658,It's adorable but runs too small.,23658,2
23658,Doesn't fit my teen daughters either.,23658,2
23658,I ordered a large.,23658,2
23658,I normally wear a small shirt.,23658,2
23659,The shoulder straps look/feel awkward unless you are doing that photos exact pose.,23659,2
23659,Not a shirt I will be wearing :(,23659,2
23660,Not stretchable at all,23660,2
23661,Not very cute on a big girl.,23661,2
23661,Shows everything unless you don't care about that.,23661,2
23662,Should probably make it more clear you need to buy two packs so that you have actual pairs of earnings.,23662,2
23662,Hopefully the next pack has the same style or I won't be happy,23662,2
23663,"Too large, I shrank with hot wash and hot dry",23663,2
23664,"Way too small, otherwise decent hat",23664,2
23665,Cheaply made.,23665,2
23665,Would not recommend.,23665,2
23666,This was WAY too small on my wife.,23666,2
23666,"After returning the L, we tried the XL.",23666,2
23666,There was little to no difference between the sizes.,23666,2
23666,disappointing.,23666,2
23667,"Wayou to small I'm a large to a X large got the biggest size the bra fit nicely, tight.",23667,2
23667,"But the underwear was a disaster, returning them immediately.",23667,2
23668,Earringswith coloring faded quickly...the stainless steel ones are fine.,23668,2
23668,Should have just ordered a set of those instead of wasting money on a multi-colered selection that did not sustain color well.,23668,2
23669,Seems like good quality but didn't fit the thick screw-on posts of my  22k indian gold earrings.,23669,2
23669,So actually doesn't fit EVERY screw on post - and kind of useless for me.,23669,2
23670,Item ran small...........not mentioned in the description,23670,2
23671,This dress was a complete disappointment.,23671,2
23671,The print looks like a carpet and at best it fits like a bathrobe.,23671,2
23672,Ordered two sizes larger than my normal size but the overall length of the shirt is too short.,23672,2
23673,"Fits nice but the graphics are very plastic on it, not screen printed as I thought it would be.",23673,2
23674,The design was very faded and blurry.,23674,2
23674,That is kind of what I expected for this price though.,23674,2
23675,The sizing on this is completely off!,23675,2
23675,"I read in previous reviews that this ran small, so I ordered a Large size.",23675,2
23675,"I'm 5'9""/125lbs and normally wear a Small.",23675,2
23675,"The Large on this fit me just right around my chest (very snug actually), but it was way too wide starting at the waist, making my hips look HUGE.It's also really short, wouldn't even cover my butt.",23675,2
23675,"Too bad - I was looking forward to wearing this for a holiday party, but I'll be returning it instead.",23675,2
23676,"These say 20 gauge, but they've got to be at least 18.",23676,2
23676,"I know nose hoops are notoriously difficult to get in, but once I got one in, the piercing started bleeding, and took several days to heal again afterward.",23676,2
23676,They're too big for my nose anyway-- it looked ridiculous once I got it in.,23676,2
23677,I ordered this a few sizes bigger because I like my hoodies to fall below my butt.,23677,2
23677,This one was weird.,23677,2
23677,The arms were long enough.,23677,2
23677,But the length was too short and the arms & shoulder area was very tight and confining.,23677,2
23677,I was planning to return it but because it wasn't part of Amazon prime I'm just going to give it my daughter.,23677,2
23678,shirt was too small,23678,2
23679,"Very cute, but the silver toned plating is very thin, and wears off quickly.",23679,2
23679,"There's bits of copper showing through, and I've only worn ta small handful of times.",23679,2
23680,Very very cute and material is not bad but the 6-12 month size is too small for my 6.5 month old.,23680,2
23680,"When I contacted seller to return or exchange, they said I can return but suggested that I should just keep it since it's only 7$ and it'll probably cost more to ship it back.",23680,2
23680,Not the kind of service I was hoping for.,23680,2
23681,I got a medium.,23681,2
23681,The black part wouldn't cover me enough...not even close.,23681,2
23681,"Also, from the back it looked completely shapeless.",23681,2
23681,Sent it back,23681,2
23682,color of the gold is very cheap looking.,23682,2
23683,The handbag is to wide....I don't carry enough stuff in a handbag to fill it out...,23683,2
23684,It's way too small.,23684,2
23684,"I started tearing off the tag before reading it (expecting it to be a normal tag, not an ultimatum), so now I can't return it.",23684,2
23684,"The style is nice, but the fabric is flimsier than expected and the size runs ridiculously low.",23684,2
23684,"I'm going to have to see if I can get it altered to fit, but I'm not happy about it.",23684,2
23685,"Cute necklace, surprised by the weight and the style was great.",23685,2
23685,But it arrived broken.,23685,2
23685,I was able to fix it with pliers.,23685,2
23686,Symbol on side fell out before 4 weeks,23686,2
23687,Wires poke me in the sides.,23687,2
23688,"I was very excited when I saw this, but when I received it  it was not as shown sadly.",23688,2
23689,Appearance,23689,2
23690,I received this dress today.,23690,2
23690,Taking it out of the plastic bag I was a little disappointed to see the frayed edging all over the lace.,23690,2
23690,It made the dress look very tacky.,23690,2
23690,It's a beautiful dress though.,23690,2
23691,This dress is way smaller and shorter than expected.,23691,2
23691,Material is more silky and shiny than the image shows.,23691,2
23691,I haven't even worn it yet and probably won't.,23691,2
23692,Runs very small,23692,2
23693,These are too short!,23693,2
23693,"I really like the stretchyness and comfort of the fabric, but the length is too short.",23693,2
23693,I will be returning them.,23693,2
23694,Band seemed nice and heavy (as opposed to light and cheap feeling) but the frame was entirely too big and the fitbit would not stay in place.,23694,2
23694,Unfortunately had to return it and try another brand.,23694,2
23695,The costume is fine but it would be nice if it would've come with everyone it said it was supposed to.,23695,2
23695,"I'm missing the headband, bracelets and boot covers and can't find a way to contact the seller.",23695,2
23695,Awesome.,23695,2
23696,Cheap material very different as the photo,23696,2
23697,I like the charms but not the leather,23697,2
23698,much larger than I thought.,23698,2
23699,It's really cute but it's not an XXL  .,23699,2
23699,It feels like a large to me was bummed out because I wanted to wear it to special bible convention I was going to attend,23699,2
23700,Size says it's a 3x and I have lost Wright from the time I ordered this,23700,2
23701,Item shipped fast.,23701,2
23701,Was not impressed with this top at all.,23701,2
23701,Was thinking the material would be kinda flowy but it was a cotton t-shirt material and ran extremely small.,23701,2
23701,I requested a return on this item.,23701,2
23702,These socks shrink a lot.,23702,2
23702,"First time fit, second time tight.",23702,2
23702,Too tight for my swollen feet.,23702,2
23703,It's obvious that this outfit was a rush job.,23703,2
23703,Strings are still hanging that wasn't trimed.,23703,2
23703,I'm wearing it now but I guess I should've got a large.,23703,2
23703,Better luck next time.,23703,2
23703,I will just give it to my 16yo it should fit her just fine.,23703,2
23704,Ok well technically it is what it describes.,23704,2
23704,"However you can clearly see ""Medical Alert"" and some other writing in rast lettering.and the medics side.",23704,2
23704,"Its also cheaply made.the shiping was fast, but that don't make up.",23704,2
23704,Also the label that thay have just painted over the existing is upside down.,23704,2
23704,Your stuff would just fall out.,23704,2
23704,Im very letdown with this,23704,2
23705,Item runs small not true to size,23705,2
23706,"For women with large breasts, this may not work for you at the very top of the dress.",23706,2
23706,I ordered a larger size and still have issues with it flattening my chest out and making it look odd.,23706,2
23707,I loved the design of this shirt but it does not fit form fitting like the picture shows.,23707,2
23707,It's also not long like the photo shows either.,23707,2
23708,"The fabric is very thin, like what you'd expect from a cheap polyester Halloween costume and not at all what comes to mind when one thinks of a sweatshirt.",23708,2
23708,"Also a bit smaller in size than we expected, even in Asian sizes.",23708,2
23709,"I understand that it's not much money, but I could get something much better for the same amount.",23709,2
23709,"Not just something better, but also something much faster.",23709,2
23709,I waited more then a month for this coat to be delivered but  I did not expect it to look so cheap.,23709,2
23709,I was expecting some kind of woolish material kind of Autumn appropriate.,23709,2
23709,Instead it's some kind of cheap looking polyester without even any kind of inner lining.,23709,2
23709,It looks like a robe.,23709,2
23709,Don't the coats suppose to have inner lining anyway?,23709,2
23709,Material used for this coat is unacceptable.,23709,2
23709,I am not even sure for what kind of season this coat is made?,23709,2
23709,To me it looks like Halloween costume.,23709,2
23710,True to size.,23710,2
23710,Way too large.,23710,2
23710,I'm returning,23710,2
23711,make sure that you get atleast two or three sizes bigger then you would normally want.,23711,2
23711,i am a small and decided to go with a medium.....  medium is like an extra small.,23711,2
23711,they are all in asian sizes!,23711,2
23711,so be aware of that!,23711,2
23712,"It was so small, I will have to give it away.",23712,2
23713,It's cute but didn't look right on me.,23713,2
23713,Too big,23713,2
23714,It turned,23714,2
23715,Does not look quite like the photo in the waist area but its pretty... Just doesn't look as pretty and dressy as the pic.,23715,2
23716,Cheep cheep cheep.,23716,2
23717,"Very slipper, not worth if you need carry any cash

23722,"If I had seen this in person first, I wouldn't have bought it.",23722,2
23722,"Thin and looked cheap, also not as soft as I hoped.",23722,2
23723,I ordered this sweater in a small and it arrived after waiting a month.,23723,2
23723,The leopard print was not brown but an unattractive olive green.,23723,2

23724,"Thin , and color didn't match what it was supposed to be",23724,2

23726,Get what you pay for.,23726,2
23727,Cute dress but was too tight for me even though i got the large.,23727,2
23727,It also clings to my every curve which meant cellulite on my booty and bra strap overhang was on full display.,23727,2
23727,Sent back.,23727,2
23727,"If u want a great fitting, flattering maternity dress, buy the patty boutik mama cowl neck ruched stretch maternity dress!",23727,2

23728,?,23728,2
23729,Would be good for a man that isn't able to really work with his hands.,23729,2
23729,My husband is an electritian and the ring stretched out within a day.,23729,2
23729,"As for shipping, great seller with fast shipping.",23729,2
23730,I am 19 and really liked the design of this shirt.,23730,2
23730,"When I received it I thought it was small, but not until I put it on did I realize how small it was.",23730,2
23730,"As a joke my family and I put it in my 8 year old sister and it was even short on her, then we put it on my 2 year old sister and it fit perfectly.",23730,2
23730,The material doesn't stretch very well.,23730,2
23730,I would suggest buying a size OR 2 bigger.,23730,2
23731,Ordered size as per the size chart provided.,23731,2
23731,Does run extremely small.,23731,2
23731,However does truly give you a good shape.,23731,2
23731,The leg holes are tight if you have larger thighs.,23731,2

23732,The visor flips up when the wind gets under it.,23732,2
23733,"Cute, however, I ordered a medium and could barely get my arms thru it, let alone anything else.",23733,2
23734,Sent this to a friend in Australia and when he received it the stitching was already busted,23734,2
23735,Not true to size ...fabric of poor quality,23735,2
23736,"TOO SMALL, RETURNING TOMORROW",23736,2
23737,Im not sure what is going on with this choli.,23737,2

23737,will upload pics.,23737,2
23737,However it is great fabric and as shown online just way tooo long!,23737,2
23738,"I completely went out on a limb with this purchase, since the outfit looks so cute in the picture.",23738,2
23738,I will say that you definitely get what you pay for.,23738,2
23738,"The outfit is cheap, and cheaply made.",23738,2
23738,Absolutely NONE of the edges were hemmed.,23738,2
23738,"The fabric under the fold of the skirt will literally fall out if you don't trim it or hem it yourself, and the top literally looks like someone cut up a doily and sewed it onto a thinly lined bralette.",23738,2
23738,"Since the sizing is meant for both the top and bottom, I went with a large for two reasons: It appears to be Asian sizes, which are naturally made smaller, and my bust size is 38in.",23738,2
23738,The skirt actually fits me perfectly.,23738,2
23738,The top could have fit another person in it.,23738,2
23738,I still gave it 2 stars because I will actually wear the skirt once it is hemmed.,23738,2
23738,"It's a great design, but it needs a LOT of QA work.",23738,2
23739,Didn't care for the fabric.,23739,2
23740,RUNS REALLY SMALL!,23740,2
23741,"Material is light, perfect for summer, but as one reviewer stated- this definitely need shape-wear.... which sort of defeats the purpose of dressing light & comfortably.",23741,2
23741,"Not flattering material, unless your smooth & thin!",23741,2
23742,Quality not same as photo.,23742,2
23742,As a photographer my eye is always looking at details and the first thing you noticed is that the fur is not the same as the one in photo.,23742,2
23742,The one received is flat and matted down.,23742,2
23742,The one in description photo is fluffy and feathery.,23742,2
23742,"Ribbon in add is felt, ribbon received is nylon",23742,2
23743,"If you are flat chested, then this is the perfect dress for you!",23743,2

23743,"The fabric had zero give,  so it turned my boobs into two flat squares.",23743,2
23743,"If you have big boobs, I would size two sizes up!",23743,2
23744,Uncomfortable.,23744,2
23744,Next time I'll go to a store to try on.,23744,2
23744,The face mask keeps covering my eyes.,23744,2
23744,And if I loosen it it falls off,23744,2
23745,Not a good quality does not sit snug,23745,2
23746,I'm giving it two stars rather than one because it's a super cute suit.,23746,2
23746,I'm a 34dd and I bought a size xl.,23746,2
23746,"(For reference, I wear Wal-Mart's xl top and small bottoms.)",23746,2
23746,I figured the bottoms weren't going to fit so I just bought it for the top.,23746,2
23746,"The bottoms were laughably massive, almost falling off once on.",23746,2
23746,The xl top seemed it was for a c cup and I was spilling out the sides.,23746,2
23746,"The hook was confusing at first, and due to my band size, I would've needed to sew at least 4 inches off.",23746,2
23746,This suit would have never worked.,23746,2
23747,The product was much too small.,23747,2
23747,I disliked the part where I would have to pay for the return.,23747,2
23747,I decided it was not worth the trouble to return it and decided to give it to someone else.,23747,2
23748,"Very cute, but seems like it's made to fit a kid",23748,2
23749,Too small.,23749,2
23749,Order size bigger.,23749,2
23750,I've ordered this underwear twice thinking both times I would be receiving the underwear pictured with tractors on them.,23750,2
23750,I still don't have underwear with tractors on them.,23750,2
23750,Both packs were different but neither featured tractors.,23750,2
23751,very small for a large,23751,2
23752,Looks nothing like the picture in the top area.,23752,2
23752,Looks more like a fashion project gone awry from the cage up.,23752,2
23752,Not square around the breast area like in the photo.,23752,2
23752,More like a rounded almost square with seams that are entirely too thick.,23752,2
23753,hard to get on ear don't wear,23753,2
23754,The lense wore when I cleaned them.,23754,2
23755,Cheap looking of course why did I expect better?,23755,2
23755,!,23755,2
23756,So adorable but seriously the sizing is soooooo far off.,23756,2
23756,Is this a juniors???,23756,2
23756,?,23756,2
23757,The leg warmers run small...very snug,23757,2
23758,"Very disappointed with the quality, had to resew every button because they where all dangling on.",23758,2
23759,"This product fits ok, just a bit smaller than I would have liked it.",23759,2
23759,The fabric is soft and pleasant on the skin.,23759,2
23759,The major feature of this top is the collar.,23759,2
23759,"Unfortunately, the collar is much smaller than in the picture and it does not drape around the shoulders.",23759,2
23759,This is a cowl neck but not a shawl neck.,23759,2
23759,"To fit like it does in the picture, it  would have to be twice as long, If the collar is what sold you on this item, don't buy it.",23759,2
23760,"It was very cute, but HUGE.",23760,2
23760,I had to return it.,23760,2
23761,"I have large chest (34DD), no implants.",23761,2
23761,I ordered XL.,23761,2
23761,The top gave me no support and was way too small.,23761,2
23761,The bottoms fit great (usually about size 4 or 6).,23761,2
23761,Returning because it's just not flattering and doesn't provide enough coverage on top.,23761,2
23761,The quality wasn't great but it wasn't awful either.,23761,2
23761,Arrived quickly too.,23761,2
23761,"If you have implants, it may be cute, just not going to work for me.",23761,2
23762,They didn't fit my son but I gave them away.,23762,2
23762,The product itself was alright.,23762,2
23762,The shoes were ordered a sice bigger but they still were small.,23762,2
23763,I was hoping they were long but they seemed to be average length,23763,2
23764,I thought perhaps I was too rough the first time so I reordered without complaint but the same thing happened with my second pair.,23764,2
23764,They're too small and in order to get them on you end up pulling a hole.,23764,2
23764,Damn shame too bc once they're on they look great...ya know... Other than the huge holes.,23764,2
23765,The material is weird and shiny.,23765,2
23765,"It fits waaaaay too small, especially around the chest.",23765,2
23765,I ordered a 5x because it is from China and I normally wear an XL.,23765,2
23765,It is also short for someone tall.,23765,2
23765,"I am 5'10"".",23765,2
23765,I have never worn because it looks so bad and bunches in weird places.,23765,2
23765,Very cheap,23765,2
23766,Sent back - too large and full.,23766,2
23767,neutral,23767,2
23768,Ordered xl.,23768,2
23768,Size was small or maybe medium.,23768,2
23768,"Nice shirt, gave it to very thin friend.",23768,2
23768,She loves is.,23768,2
23768,She wears mostly smalls.,23768,2
23769,I loved it just to small,23769,2
23770,I took it out of the package and didn't even bother to TRY to put this on.,23770,2
23770,Gave to my granddaughter.,23770,2
23770,Color was nice.,23770,2
23771,painful to put on and too large and awkward.,23771,2
23771,almost falls out,23771,2
23772,"I liked them, although they were smaller than expected.",23772,2
23772,"However, they didn't had a safe guard.",23772,2
23772,Wore them once and one of the earrings fell off my ear.,23772,2
23772,Couldn't find it.,23772,2
23772,Maybe a safe in the back for future earrings.,23772,2
23773,small than actual size.,23773,2
23774,I like it jus somewhat small.,23774,2
23775,The neck and shoulders of this dress did not lay correctly.,23775,2
23775,"There was a lot of bunching in the front of the dress, in the middle.",23775,2
23775,"It just didn't look right and, although I am an experienced sewer, I could not figure out a way it could be altered to lay correctly.",23775,2
23776,"Cheap fabric, runs WAY small (I'm 5'5"" 132lb and usually wear a 4/6/Medium).",23776,2
23776,"I ordered a XXL (yes, double XL) and it fits well.",23776,2
23776,In the picture it looks like it's a deep V-neck whereas in reality it's at more of a t-shirt neck level and has a tie at the neck that I'll probably leave undone (if you look close in the picture you can kind of see it).,23776,2
23777,Vest was not true to size.,23777,2
23777,It was a smaller fit.,23777,2
23778,I got these shorts super fast!,23778,2
23778,They are really cute.,23778,2
23778,I ordered a small and they fit great.,23778,2
23778,Maybe a tad too tight.,23778,2
23778,I want to order more but am worried if I order a medium they will be too big.,23778,2
23778,I still recommend them.,23778,2
23778,Color is great!,23778,2
23778,Nice shorts!,23778,2
23778,"Update...
after buying the pink ones and liking them for the most part except they were a little tight, I decided to buy the blue and the mint ones in a medium hoping they would fit better.",23778,2
23778,Wrong.,23778,2
23778,They literally fit me as if I had bought an X-large.,23778,2
23778,How can sizes vary that much?,23778,2
23778,"And the ""mint"" ones, are not mint.",23778,2
23778,It's more like a baby blue.,23778,2
23778,"Do not recommend, and I'm disappointed",23778,2
23779,It's not as long either because I have a long waist.,23779,2
23780,not bad,23780,2
23781,Runs small but very cute.,23781,2
23782,I ordered this for a costume but not suitable for everyday wear.,23782,2
23782,It's very poorly made with loose fraying strings at the seems and button holes.,23782,2
23782,You can easily trim them off but I would worry about the construction holding up through a wash.,23782,2
23783,Somewhat large,23783,2
23784,The top had no padding and then they sent nipple stickers that you have to put on under the bathing suit.,23784,2
23784,It would be see through if you wore it without the stickers.,23784,2
23785,They are nice socks but I got three of the same kind there were supposed to be two different pairs.,23785,2
23786,ONE SIZE MY A@@.,23786,2
23786,I AM A LARGE AND I COULD GET IT ON-- BUT IT IS NOT LOOSE FITTING AT ALL.,23786,2
23786,ONLY IF YOU WEAR A SMALL WITH THIS FIT LIKE THE PICTURE.,23786,2
23787,Cheap feeling,23787,2
23788,Very small,23788,2
23789,I love the dress but the sizing is way off.,23789,2
23789,I got a large (my usual size) and it is just ridiculously big.,23789,2
23789,It's as if I was 300lbs and lost weight then decided to try on my old dress.,23789,2
23789,I'm not exaggerating either.,23789,2
23789,I'm returning it for a size small.,23789,2
23789,Please size down when ordering this dress.,23789,2
23790,"This is a really cute top, but it got a hole in it after only one time of wearing it.",23790,2
23790,"And it is very loose fit, so it's not as if the material was stretched.",23790,2
23790,Wish it would have lasted longer.,23790,2
23790,"They also have a black one that I would love to have, but I'm worried about the quality so I won't be buying it.",23790,2
23791,Lady parts show from the split,23791,2
23792,"I'm 5'7"" and these ran too short.",23792,2
23792,NOT one size fits all...,23792,2
23793,My daughter loved it!,23793,2
23793,Looks great!,23793,2
23793,Only problem is less than a month after she got it the picture has popped off the necklace.,23793,2
23794,"Very thin, low quality cotton.",23794,2
23794,Has a chemical stench.,23794,2
23794,Doesn't compare to the quality of clothes you can get on sale at Gymboree for a comparable price.,23794,2
23794,"Almost like re-branded, really cheap pjs the Children's Place sometimes sells for a fraction of this price.",23794,2
23794,2 stars because the monkey is cute.,23794,2
23795,The material makes an annoying noise.,23795,2
23795,This skirt is made small.,23795,2
23795,I should have ordered a size up.,23795,2
23795,It rides up a bit.,23795,2
23795,I didn't bother sending back.,23795,2
23796,This jacket is a very bright pink (think pepto bismol pink).,23796,2
23796,"I didn't realize it had shoulder pads, which I do not like at all.",23796,2
23796,"Not only that, the shoulders are stitched where they stand out like small wings.",23796,2
23796,The sizing is accurate however and the jacket fits well but the shoulders made me dislike it.,23796,2
23796,Also the buttons are a cheap gold that cheapen the whole look.,23796,2
23796,The jacket itself is not a great quality to being with.,23796,2
23796,"I would not recommend it,",23796,2
23797,Sizing runs quite small.,23797,2
23797,The white part of the shirt is quite sheer - bras and tanks are clearly visible through it.,23797,2
23798,"Item came in faster than expected, but the dress is very thin Polyester and did not look like the picture.",23798,2
23798,It was tight and long...not above the knee and loose flowing.,23798,2
23798,The seller refunded a portion of the money and told me to keep it because it would cost more to ship it back China.,23798,2
23799,Meh.,23799,2
23800,Looks just like the picture.,23800,2
23800,Very good quality.,23800,2
23800,"Although the inches are correct, the cup size is extremely incorrect.",23800,2
23800,"I'm a 38C, it didn't even cover my areolas.",23800,2
23800,I felt as though the cup size were for A/B cups.,23800,2
23800,I ordered the XL to be safe.,23800,2
23800,Mrs Mark J,23800,2
23801,Passed to daughter,23801,2
23802,The bill of the hat is not as pictured.,23802,2
23802,It only has one row of decorating.,23802,2
23802,Really disappointed about that.,23802,2
23803,These are too long and too slick and shiny to look like anything you should wear outside of a dance studio.,23803,2
23804,Tapers and tunnels are very short and should not be used for stretching.,23804,2
23804,2 stars because they are exactly as described.,23804,2
23805,"the one which I ordered had a little sharp edge on one of the buckle, had to return",23805,2
23806,"Honestly I wanted to love this, but.. i couldn't i got for an event and the shortest part of the dress is short.",23806,2
23806,I am only 5'6 and its short.,23806,2
23806,I wore to something and had to hold the front closed the whole time until i changed.. very upset about this dress.,23806,2
23806,i even paid extra to get mailed sooner..,23806,2
23807,The cowl neck isn't as large as the picture shows.,23807,2
23808,"I like the fabric & lace trim; however, this piece runs really small.",23808,2
23808,"I had to exchange the Medium for a Large, and the Large is snug on me.",23808,2
23808,I'm tall & slender so having the Large not fit much better was disappointing.,23808,2
23809,They were small on hip area so size up if you don't have a perfectly flat stomach.,23809,2
23810,"I am pretty short, and while this fit nicely around the breasts and waists, the torso was very short making it uncomfortable to wear.",23810,2
23811,Jacket was way too small.,23811,2
23811,Too much trouble with trying to return things via Amazon.,23811,2
23811,I gave it to my 13yr daughter.,23811,2
23812,TOO SMALL.,23812,2
23812,I Orders EXtra large and NOpe.,23812,2
23813,Runs large.,23813,2
23813,Returned.,23813,2
23814,"Even after perusing all the reviews to carefully assess what size I should order, I was disappointed with this top.",23814,2
23814,I didn't even try it on bc it looked so small and short....,23814,2
23814,"I am a 14-16, 5'4"" and wear a women's large, occasionally a junior's XL; the XXL that I received was, by all appearances, equal to a women's 'small' and would barely cover one's belly area let alone be long and flowy like the pics.",23814,2
23814,The material isn't very stretchy either and it is cheap-feeling---not breathable or soft.,23814,2
23814,"Additionally, the ""dark grey"" I ordered and is shown in the description doesn't match what was sent; mine is just a tad darker than a light grey.",23814,2
23814,"I've had much better apparel/fit results with other Chinese manufacturures, but not this one.",23814,2
23815,don't order this stuff...looks good but comes from china and cost a fortune to return it..they don't even put a return address on pakage...big rip off and not even close to true size,23815,2
23816,Very short sleeves.,23816,2
23816,Returned it.,23816,2
23817,Poor quality,23817,2
23818,"This product looks really nice online, but in person its not as cute.",23818,2
23818,"It looks cheaper in person, I am definitely disappointed :/",23818,2
23819,The material of this dress is real thin.,23819,2
23819,I usually wear a misses 12 or 14.,23819,2
23819,"I purchased a Plus size XL since it was a bodycon dress, but it was still tight.",23819,2
23819,I returned it.,23819,2
23820,Didnt like the fake looking leather material.,23820,2
23820,"I returned it

If this review was helpful please hit the Like Button",23820,2
23821,OMG.,23821,2
23821,It sure is small.,23821,2
23821,"Nice material , real pretty,  I should have looked at the size chart more closely...",23821,2
23822,"These are much shorter than shown, barely coming to the top of the hip.",23822,2
23822,"Otherwise, the size is pretty spot on.",23822,2
23823,"Good price for the number of pieces, but I much prefer the traditional retainers with longer side pieces.",23823,2
23823,Thought I would try both metal and plastic to see which I preferred.,23823,2
23823,I already lost all 5 plastic pieces as they have fallen out during my sleep and are difficult to find.,23823,2
23823,"As for the metal ones, I don't like wearing them because the sides are still visible sometimes when I am wearing them, which somewhat defeats the purpose for me.",23823,2
23823,I didn't have a problem with the plastic ones being visible since they're nearly clear.,23823,2
23823,"The sides are not long enough to grip inside the nose and stay in an upright position to remain unseen, yet are still long enough to show when hanging down.",23823,2
23823,"Would maybe repurchase a pack of just the plastic ones and treat them as disposable since I lose them so often, but will probably go back to the traditional style of retainer as those last longer for me.",23823,2
23824,This blouse runs really small.,23824,2
23824,I ordered the blue navy with all color hearts.,23824,2
23824,I usually wear a Large but decided to order a XL so it could be more flowy.,23824,2
23824,Well I tried to put it on and I couldn't even get it pass down my boobs.,23824,2
23824,Material is really thin so I was scare to even force it to pull it down.,23824,2
23825,Wonderful material.,23825,2
23825,Product runs small.,23825,2
23825,Nicely built clothing item for juniors.,23825,2
23826,I bought this dress for a Christmas party to be Morticia Addams.,23826,2
23826,"It was okay for a party, but in the photos it looks like a different fabric.",23826,2
23826,"Upon arrival it' s a shiny material that looks cheap, and at the knot on the side the seam had come open so you could see my skin.",23826,2
23826,"I kept it for the party and will keep it for a future costume but be aware that it looks very cheap and for thirty dollars, you can't use it on a regular occasion.",23826,2
23827,I thought this pocket book was bigger I can't carry none of my stuff in it.,23827,2
23827,The handle is so small I can't carry it on ur shoulder I don't understand I paid 45.98$ for this product I want to please send it bk please.,23827,2
23827,Brandy,23827,2
23828,I purchased it because it had gold hair and dress  and the gold is gone now.,23828,2
23828,I still love the charm it is for my granddaughter who passed away it looked like her.,23828,2
23828,Just wish the gold hair would have lasted....,23828,2
23829,I ordered the largest size and it's too big.,23829,2
23829,I'm a size 14 in regular clothing.,23829,2
23829,It's a cotton blend on top and chiffon on the bottom.,23829,2
23829,It's way too short and I'm 5'2.,23829,2
23829,Hits the middle of my thigh.,23829,2
23829,Would never be able to move without mooning everyone behind me.,23829,2
23830,The material on this shirt is to snug of a fit.,23830,2
23830,And the sizes run small.,23830,2
23830,I got a size Large (postpartum) & is still too tight even though my body game isn't all that big.,23830,2
23831,"cheaply made and paint is only on one of the barbells, the barbells themselves are also crooked.",23831,2
23832,For the price I guess these would be ok...these looked and felt really cheap,23832,2
23833,Too small and the top is very hard and uncomfortable,23833,2
23834,very nice but sizes run small.,23834,2
23835,I love the way it looks but the chain broke easily.,23835,2
23836,"The top was tiny, literally smaller than a sports bra, and the skirt was so big it basically fell off.",23836,2
23837,Size is waaaay off.,23837,2
23837,It was huge.,23837,2
23837,I had to return it.,23837,2
23838,"I returned them, & I am still ordering the XL; I normally Small so, I ordered Medium but they come very small, like XS..",23838,2
23838,"I will need to re-order for sure, becoz Quslity id good...2 sizes up which is XL for sure the XL will fit me..
Their quality is 5-Stars, but the sizing is below expectations...",23838,2
23839,Looked great till I put it on.,23839,2
23839,"I'm 5'7"" 130 lbs.",23839,2
23839,The hip area was way to big but the top was fine,23839,2
23840,"not an alternative to zipping your pants, this was super uncomfortable and didn't stay put.",23840,2
23840,like wearing spanx all day around your gut.,23840,2
23841,Gorgeous dress!,23841,2
23841,Horrible fit.,23841,2
23841,I got my measurements and ordered a size bigger and it still didn't fit.,23841,2
23841,Also when I received it a lot of the gems had already fallen off or were about to.,23841,2
23841,Wish I didn't waste the money.,23841,2
23842,large fits like small.,23842,2
23842,they refunded back half of cost due to size issue.,23842,2
23843,This product runs too large and is VERY see through I won't be able to exercise in these unfortunately,23843,2
23844,Very very very small not to mention the arm holes are tiny and for that being a plus size dress I'm very surprised I will not be ordering another one.,23844,2
23845,Cheap material,23845,2
23846,Beautiful dress but it is too small.,23846,2
23846,Not for the curvy girl.,23846,2
23847,Grommets are coming loose.,23847,2
23847,Not very happy,23847,2
23848,Cute but wayyyy too small.,23848,2
23848,"I ordered a large size and the torso was about 10 inches too short, so there is no way I could wear it.",23848,2
23849,Did not fit as well as other Crootas previously purchased,23849,2
23850,"I wish it fit a little tighter, and the material was a bit clingier..",23850,2
23850,But overall it's ok.,23850,2
23851,"Very doubtful that these are 79% cotton, they don't wick the moisture away like a regular cotton sock.",23851,2
23851,"There is way more stretch in these than a regular cotton sock, my guess is they are 50% at the most.",23851,2
23851,The package and socks are not marked as to what the blend is.,23851,2
23851,Also they run just a little small.,23851,2
23852,This dress is cute but it has some serious flaws.,23852,2
23852,"The material is seriously thin, the stitching is coming apart straight from the package and there are several places where there are mis-stitches and threads coming loose.",23852,2
23852,Now having said all that the dress is also form flattering and very sexy on but you get what you pay for and the dress was cheap but cheaply made as well.originally I was going to send it back but I've decided to keep it and not go through the hassle of sending it back to China and spending as much as I bought the dress for to send it back.,23852,2
23853,Well I'm 5'9 and thin but i guess my torso is to long cuz it fits me short and the sleeves too.,23853,2
23854,"The product is see through, a little shiny, and they are a little baggy at the bottom.",23854,2
23854,They are also high waisted.,23854,2
23854,I'm 5'5 160lbs,23854,2
23855,Dead battery....,23855,2
23856,"A really cute suit, but didn't fit as expected (a little small) and not flattering on me.",23856,2
23856,The back has no fringe so anything you may want to conceal is out in the open.,23856,2
23857,runs small.. also the color I received doesn't look like the shirt the model is wearing.,23857,2
23858,It pulls up in the back.,23858,2
23858,And it can get hot,23858,2
23859,Magnet buttons fell off after time.,23859,2
23860,Had dirt on bottom of shoes.,23860,2
23860,These are not new and i question if they are even real.,23860,2
23861,Not very sturdy n Lakers kept falling out.,23861,2
23862,"Such a cute shirt, but can't wear it.",23862,2
23862,It runs atleast 2 sizes to small.,23862,2
23862,:(,23862,2
23863,Shirt was very nice but the castle is a cheap press on decal.,23863,2
23863,We got the shirt today and it's already got some defects in the decal.,23863,2
23864,"I like the bottoms they fit perfectly but the top doesn't look anything like in the picture , you would have to put some pads in it and it runs small",23864,2
23865,nice fabric made nicely cute but ... EXTREMLY SMALL,23865,2
23866,THE FITTING ITS NOT LIKE EXPECTED AND THE TERMINATION IS NOT GOOD,23866,2
23867,"I like the style and the fleece lining, but the size was very large, and the ""slate"" color did not look like the color in this picture.",23867,2
23867,It was more of a drab gray.,23867,2
23867,"I was disappointed to learn that the return shipping cost of $7.50 is deducted from the amount refunded, so I did not want to take a chance on an exchange.",23867,2
23867,"I simply returned it for a full refund, which will be less the $7.50 shipping charge.",23867,2
23867,"If I had noticed that policy, I would not have purchased the jacket in the first place.",23867,2
23867,"Two stars, not because I don't like the jacket but because I don't like the cost to return it.",23867,2
23868,My 4 year old loved opening these up on Christmas day and wears them every day.,23868,2
23868,"Sadly, the lights on one shoe went out after only 1 week of normal wear, having never gotten them wet or even playing too hard.",23868,2
23868,"He still likes wearing them, we are just sad to have gotten a product that didn't last.",23868,2
23869,I have found this product to shine for a few days.,23869,2
23869,"Started to turn black after basic wear, and broke after two weeks.",23869,2
23869,Disappointed in the quality for the price I paid.,23869,2
23870,Not my favorite.,23870,2
23870,It's super short and looks better in the picture than in person.,23870,2
23871,It seems to be too sheer  fabric wise.,23871,2
23871,"If it were lighter than brown, I would probably have to wear something under it.",23871,2
23872,Wallet too big and it did not say in the decription,23872,2
23873,Runs small.,23873,2
23874,"this has a tight, clingy fit.",23874,2
23874,I did not like the material,23874,2
23875,Poor quality.,23875,2
23875,Set only lasted 6 weeks.,23875,2
23876,The large is not the regular large.,23876,2
23876,"It runs big, like xl",23876,2
23877,"They looked cute when I put them on but within a couple hours, my fingers were completely green and the color started to come off.",23877,2
23877,I was really annoyed with that mostly because I did like them when they arrived.,23877,2
23877,I had to throw them away after the first use.,23877,2
23878,The dress its self is beautiful but I normally wear a 3x and with this I had to buy a size bigger and it still doesn't fit comfortably.,23878,2
23879,The dress looked nothing like the picture.,23879,2
23879,"It was a different material, though similar in color.",23879,2
23879,The item was 2 - 3 sizes too small.,23879,2
23879,"Made a good gift for a little girl I know, so it's all good.",23879,2
23880,"Cheap, don't waste your money",23880,2
23881,Very disappointed because I ordered this for a Christmas outfit to match my girls in grey cardigans.,23881,2
23881,Came day before Christmas Eve and it is NOT grey.,23881,2
23881,It's as white as can be.,23881,2
23881,Giving this 2 stars because I have the same cardigan for my older daughter and it is nice - but it's actually GREG,23881,2
23882,"Doesn't look like the picture at all, was disappointed.",23882,2
23882,The one shown is so nice.,23882,2
23883,First off - it was very small and rather dainty - but still very nice and my son loved it!,23883,2
23883,The clasp broke within 10 minutes of putting it on.,23883,2
23883,"We have saved the pieces and may yet re-string it, but still only worth getting if you like it enough to consider it a craft project.",23883,2
23884,Runs extremely small,23884,2
23885,Too small plus the zipper part wasn't finish.,23885,2
23885,Beautiful fabric.,23885,2
23886,"Cheap, I did not have high expectations for the price but my teen daughter just laughed at this.",23886,2
23886,Very flimsy.,23886,2
23886,The box it shipped looked like an accordion.,23886,2
23886,Gave it to a teacher to give to his 4 year old to play with.,23886,2
23887,Bought baby socks... Would fit a toddler,23887,2
23888,"Too small, buy a size larger",23888,2
23889,It's not a solid color all over.,23889,2
23889,It's sheer in the front and not good for larger chested women,23889,2
23890,I ordered x-large and it was too big.,23890,2
23890,And it was too shear and definitely too short.,23890,2
23890,I ordered it because of the way it looked in the picture and when it came it looked nothing like the picture.,23890,2
23890,I gave it two stars only because the skirt came early.,23890,2
23890,But I was definitely disappointed I ordered it to wear for a night out and I definitely could not wear it.,23890,2
23890,I don't like to give bad reviews but it is true.,23890,2
23891,"Wife loves them, but they're a little small for the balls",23891,2
23892,Cool looking buckle no doubt but 2 days into wearing it I have to fix it.,23892,2
23892,The ball fell off and it won't stay clamped.,23892,2
23893,1 star (0 really) for the bra and panty.,23893,2
23893,"4 stars for the robe, but that's because I'm replacing the belt with another.",23893,2
23893,2 stars for the whole set.,23893,2
23893,"The bra would fit a tiny 10 year old, except the lacing wouldn't be appropriate for a child.",23893,2
23893,It's beyond tiny.,23893,2
23893,It's for someone who is maybe an A cup and is tinier that a 30 going around the chest.,23893,2
23893,I'm a 32D and the medium is just a joke.,23893,2
23893,The panty is even worse.,23893,2
23893,I wouldn't even call it that.,23893,2
23893,It looks like scrap fabric put together.,23893,2
23893,This would be so uncomfortable to wear for the 3 minutes that it needs to be on the body before getting ripped off.,23893,2
23893,"I've worn a whole ton and only wear thongs and the like on a daily basis...
What killed the set is the lack of quality.",23893,2
23893,"No stretch, lack of material (there should be a softer insert in the panty), and the sewing/threading is thick, obvious, and hideous.",23893,2
23893,The robe.,23893,2
23893,The only reason I'm keeping the set.,23893,2
23893,Looks seductive with nothing underneath.,23893,2
23893,"However the belt was short (can only be tied and then it sticks out, can not tie into a bow or to hang down), and I'm a size 2 in pants, small in the waist.",23893,2
23893,I replaced it with another black satin sash and it worked out.,23893,2
23893,"I took a risk purchasing a cheap lingerie item online (I've gotten an amazing lingerie for $12 on Amazon, so I will not say 'you get what you pay for'),  but would not buy from this seller or make again.",23893,2
23894,Material nice but dem tooooooooo smallll order 2 a large and xl more like small and medium,23894,2
23895,Only suitable for thin watches...otherwise doeanot fot,23895,2
23896,Beautiful blouse but not even close to the size that was stated.,23896,2
23897,Ok.....so I like the swimsuit but u definitely have to have the same body as the model,23897,2
23898,it was difficult to put on and stay on.,23898,2
23899,"Material very flimsy,",23899,2
23900,The color faded in spots when washed.,23900,2
23901,Very long pants,23901,2
23902,Sizing runs small even taking into account Asian sizes.,23902,2
23902,"XL pouch too small, maybe because their cotton too much material between the cheeks.",23902,2
23903,"The handbag was cute but after using it a second time to match an outfit, the strap at the base came apart.",23903,2
23903,"Since I only used it for dress and used twice, up it is too late to return it.",23903,2
23903,Straps are not durable at all and  the metal clasp comes apart.,23903,2
23903,The straps are problematic.,23903,2
23903,Would not buy again for that reason.,23903,2
23904,Cute for a young girl,23904,2
23905,Bought this for my cousin.,23905,2
23905,He and his brother do parades in hero/villain costumes with our local comic shop.,23905,2
23905,He wasn't allowed to dress as Deadpool (his mom loaths the new film) so he wanted Deathstroke.,23905,2
23905,The mask is horrid but I am a painter so I'm going to try to improve it.,23905,2
23905,We also plan to add things to make it look more realistic as we always do with cosplay.,23905,2
23905,"Very happy for the fast shipping and correct sizing, but the quality doesn't match the price.",23905,2
23906,runs VERY small,23906,2
23907,These are definitely adult and not child sizes.,23907,2
23908,Not soft material and cheap looking,23908,2
23909,"It's cute, was packaged well and arrived promptly but the tie closure fell apart when I attempted to untie it to try it on...you get what you pay for!",23909,2
23910,Will pass on to my niece.,23910,2
23910,"It is cute, but runs really small.",23910,2
23911,Runs very small and thin material.,23911,2
23912,Didn't specify it was a girl's shirt.,23912,2
23913,Purchased for my 9 month old.,23913,2
23913,"It's swimming on her, but it fits my almost 4 year old perfectly.",23913,2
23913,(They're both about 50-75 percentile for height and weight.),23913,2
23914,"The product quality is very good, but BEWARE!",23914,2
23914,These run very small!,23914,2
23914,I am 8.5-9 and I ordered size 9/10 and they BARELY fit.,23914,2
23915,To big sending back,23915,2
23916,way smaller then what a mens XL should be.,23916,2
23916,I am trying to find a small child to give it to,23916,2
23917,Zipper is surprisingly flimsy and low quality for The North Face.,23917,2
23917,It stuck.,23917,2
23917,I returned the jacket.,23917,2
23918,I bought this boot since they no longer make the Kiowa Tactical in my size.,23918,2
23918,The left heel inner seam rubs a open sore in less than a hour mushroom hunting.,23918,2
23918,I applied a piece of high speed tape but still rubs my heel.,23918,2
23918,I will not buy this brand again.,23918,2
23919,"I usually wear a 1x , I bought a 3x and it is tight, the material is soft and strechable so I am keeping it.",23919,2
23920,not strong enough too hold cards,23920,2
23921,"VERY SMALL, NO LONG AS SHOW.",23921,2
23922,"Poor quality, the jacket got ripped withing a month.",23922,2
23922,"Ended up buying another snowsuit for my son, because he grew up out of this one way before the rnd of the season.",23922,2
23922,Not warm enough for canadian winter.,23922,2
23922,Big disappointment!,23922,2
23923,Very easy to break but it's really pretty.,23923,2
23924,So so very see through.,23924,2
23924,Material is so thin it's almost sheer.,23924,2
23924,I may just end up returning it if i can't find a slip to wear under it.,23924,2
23924,such a disappointment!,23924,2
23925,Just ok,23925,2
23926,Dress is nice but runs big.,23926,2
23926,I read previous reviews that all said it runs small.,23926,2
23926,I'm 5 '8 and 130.,23926,2
23926,All my measurements were for a small so I didn't think it would be a problem.,23926,2
23926,The dress reached the floor when in flats so I would also recommend anyone shorter to also prepare to wear heels with it.,23926,2
23927,Works well if your pregnant not if your athletic built.,23927,2
23927,Ordered a small and it was still too big and bulky.,23927,2
23927,Material is extremely stretchy.,23927,2
23927,Not for me,23927,2
23928,"Really pretty blouse,but not true to size.",23928,2
23928,"My order was 2xl, it looks like a medium.",23928,2
23929,The ring sizes are not the same as the  picture.,23929,2
23929,That was disappointing.,23929,2
23929,It also took so long for me to even get them that I kinda forgot about them by the time they arrived.,23929,2
23929,When I got and tried them on it didn't feel right.,23929,2
23929,I had to look up the Amazon pic again and was disappointed to see some of the rings weren't the same size.,23929,2
23930,I liked the product but it's made 2 sizes too small,23930,2
23931,Too dim for the Florida sun.,23931,2
23931,Great look and fit otherwise.,23931,2
23932,It is a beautiful piece but the hook broke after wearing it 2 times.,23932,2
23933,Disappointingly short.,23933,2
23934,Pretty disappointed because there is no back logo it's only on the front.,23934,2
23935,Love the colors but not big enough.,23935,2
23936,"Cute, but after washing and drying it was definitely more like a 12 mo",23936,2
23937,Cheap material,23937,2
23938,Well its a very thin fleece fabric the hat doesnt fit way do small.,23938,2
23939,"I love the look and the material seems nice but it's way way to small, got a xl and could have used an xxl if not bigger, normally wear large",23939,2
23940,The chain is a bit long and the collar itself is a bit short around the neck.,23940,2
23940,It has to be tight and close to the neck for it to look good otherwise it looks like I'm wearing something that is illfitting.,23940,2
23941,It is pretty but it's not true to size I'm a 7 but it fits like a 6 so I can't even put it on,23941,2
23942,"I bought this shirt to fit nice and loose, so I sized up.",23942,2
23942,The shirt was short and wide!,23942,2
23942,The colors are darker in person and it smelled absolutely AWFUL.,23942,2
23942,"I'm not sure what process is used, but the dyes used made this shirt smell like fresh tar.",23942,2
23942,Blech.,23942,2
23942,I returned immediately.,23942,2
23943,"It was a beautiful mask, but the hit was somewhat disappointing and the beading around the eyes fell off right out of the box!",23943,2
23944,"it was too small for me, I gave it away.",23944,2
23945,Poor quality and did not fit as expected.,23945,2
23946,It doesn't look anything like this in real life.,23946,2
23946,Looks a lot cheaper and the sleeves are some sort of weird synthetic material.,23946,2
23947,To small,23947,2
23948,The fit is perfect if you use the size chart.,23948,2
23948,The jacket initially looks good but after a few times wearing it the seams are coming undone.,23948,2
23948,"After its first wash the cotton inside the seams moved, making it look lumpy in some areas.",23948,2
23948,Careful when washing.,23948,2
23948,I will say it is very warm.,23948,2
23949,"Size was perfect, however, the top was put together with two of the same side breast, so now she has to wear it with one normal and one showing the stitching because I had to reverse it so it would tie correctly.",23949,2
23950,WAS DISAPPOINTED.,23950,2
23950,STRAP ON ONE SIDE WAS SHORTER THAN OTHER SIDE.,23950,2
23950,NOTHING I CAN'T FIX BUT I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,23950,2
23951,"The dress is nice, but to small.",23951,2
23951,"If you order, you will need to order  two sizes bigger than your regular size.",23951,2
23952,The dress is beautiful!,23952,2
23952,But I ordered an XL and it looks more like a large or medium,23952,2
23953,Smaller than expected,23953,2
23954,Would not stay on at all.,23954,2
23955,Not the same image as pictured in photos.,23955,2
23955,Boxy fit...,23955,2
23956,"I am returning this bag, which I just received yesterday.",23956,2
23956,"Upon first receiving it, I tested out all the zippers.",23956,2
23956,"One of the zippers was defective, and that is without me even having a chance to use the bag.",23956,2
23956,Be aware that the TEETH of the ZIPPERS are all made out of PLASTIC.,23956,2
23956,I've never experienced plastic zippers in a purse before and was surprised after looking closely.,23956,2
23956,"I closely inspected all the zipper teeth, by feel and sight and they are all plastic.",23956,2
23956,"(silver in color and made to ""look"" like metal).",23956,2
23956,There's a good reason quality purses are made of metal zippers - so they last!,23956,2
23956,"Because of what I consider a flaw in the material used, I am NOT ordering another one - not with plastic zippers.",23956,2
23956,"Without zippers to secure all your items in a purse, it's useless.",23956,2
23956,It's a shame because the overall design with the front pockets and roominess inside was just what I was looking for.,23956,2
23956,"I'm not a big fan of those top handles, but the strap itself seemed fairly secure.",23956,2
23956,The attached smaller organizer bag was really cute and would have been quite useful.,23956,2
23956,It is obvious to me that the quality doesn't stand up to the price they are asking for this purse.,23956,2
23957,Hemlines and stitchings out of wack but cool design,23957,2
23958,Nothing like the pic; material is not soft and flowy as it appears in the pic.,23958,2
23958,"Color is vibrant and is super long (I'm 5'9"").",23958,2
23958,I will not be taking this on vacation with me and will be returning it.,23958,2
23959,"I'm 5'4, 140lbs and ordered a large.",23959,2
23959,I can get it on cause it's stretchy but it'd be a long shirt and that's about it.,23959,2
23959,Maybe it'd be cute with leggings???,23959,2
23959,It's super hugging and a very thin spandex material where it looks like it'd be jersey.,23959,2
23959,"It's not a dress, cause it's extremely short for one and it's not a large..at least not in US sizes.",23959,2
23959,Even if there had been an extra large I don't think it'd have fit much better.,23959,2
23959,Hoping my 80lb daughter will be able to wear it more comfortably and as a dress.,23959,2
23960,"I'm  5'5"" and it barely came to my waist.",23960,2
23960,Girl I picture must be three feet tall.,23960,2
23961,"great idea, but it became undone at first wear",23961,2
23962,Only came with one,23962,2
23963,it came smaller than expected if it actually fit right i wouldve gave 5 stars,23963,2
23964,Very comfortable but shorter and wider than it looks!,23964,2
23965,Broke almost immediately!,23965,2
23966,"Good day I received the goods unfortunately was not to select or size or model, size L pedi and I get or labels have !",23966,2
23966,!,23966,2
23966,"I think it's a lack of seriousness with the customer and you are doing false advertising, the worst thing is to return to Venezuela to Miami the product leaves me very costly and cumbersome process so I do not see how to fix this",23966,2
23967,Very cute.,23967,2
23967,I knew it would run small so I ordered the largest.,23967,2
23967,I wear between a medium and extra large in women's (US) sizes.,23967,2
23967,Ordered the 3X.,23967,2
23967,Can't even attempt to button it,23967,2
23968,I was very disappointed....first with the length as I asked for it to be adjusted as my mom is short it was not done.,23968,2
23968,"It was almost 12"" longer than the requested length.",23968,2
23968,Secondly it was tight around the mid section.,23968,2
23968,Only good thing it was shipped quickly.,23968,2
23969,To long they came down to my knees,23969,2
23970,"A lot smaller than anticipated, not as pretty as the picture.",23970,2
23971,Looks so different when i got it.,23971,2
23971,I thought it was not my order and my size but when i checked the design I realized that it was this hoodie.,23971,2
23971,They are kinda small.,23971,2
23971,I'm usually medium but i ordered xl and it's somewhat small.,23971,2
23972,"holds in the tummy well, but the butt lifting section sucks",23972,2
23973,The rings are nice but both chains broke within a day.,23973,2
23974,the shoulders were not broad enuf.,23974,2

23984,Just not for me.,23984,2
23985,"so thin and cheap feeling its also not as wide as i expected , if it gets caught in anything guaranteed it will rip , not worth the price.",23985,2

23991,I have another swim diaper of same material and that one has never reacted with his skin that way.,23991,2

24063,Th top does not have any support at all.,24063,2

24067,"They do pill, but after numerous uses and are generally more hardy than other jeggings I own.",24067,2

24069,I ordered an XL in a few other colors which fit well.,24069,2
24069,I don't know if it was just this pair or what.,24069,2

24070,Very thin material,24070,2

24076,"Anvil needs to correct their shirt sizing, communicate those differences with Woot and save consumers a headache.",24076,2
24077,"Well, I like he style, but it's a poor quality",24077,2
24078,Don't order from this company.,24078,2
24078,Too small and cheap.,24078,2
24079,It was a beautiful dress but not sized true to body type.,24079,2
24079,It's made for someone with a very small bust and tiny waist.,24079,2
24080,Sizing was extremely small was disappointed,24080,2
24081,small fits too small/tight--I would have ordered a medium but will not hassle with returning it for an exchange,24081,2
24082,Great timing on shipping.,24082,2
24082,"But ""one side"" is really like an x-large.",24082,2
24082,Hoping it will shrink.,24082,2
24083,The plastic around the top of the stockings makes it look & feel cheap.,24083,2
24084,"Sizes are off, had to return.",24084,2
24085,Cheap fabric and poorly made.,24085,2
24085,Total disappointment; went straight to the local charity shop.,24085,2
24086,I received a watch from Bling Jewelry that does not work.,24086,2
24087,this was to small all over but the swimsuit  was pretty,24087,2
24088,I don't like the color.,24088,2
24088,"The material is nice,soft.",24088,2
24088,Returning.,24088,2
24089,They came in a package but didn't fit the same at all.,24089,2
24089,They came quickly I just wish they fit.,24089,2
24089,Ones too small and ones too big.,24089,2
24089,"But the gray pair is at least comfy, that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of one.",24089,2
24090,This is certainly not the same material as shown.,24090,2
24090,its a thick t shirt cotton and not stitched the same.,24090,2
24090,"i am disappointed they can advertise a different item than they sell but it is from overseas and that always mean buyer beware...win some, lose some....not total loss.",24090,2
24090,"its ok, but not as cute as photo.",24090,2
24091,It is looks cheap,24091,2
24092,"I got the 12-18m for my 9m old who wears 12-18m clothes, and it was too small - the legs barely came down to his knees.",24092,2
24092,the arms were fine.,24092,2
24092,But the whole point of buying this was to provide full coverage when out in the sun (to avoid having to lather on the sunblock) but it was just as effective as the (cuter & cheaper) LS & short sets they sell in the major chain stores.,24092,2
24092,Not impressed.,24092,2
24092,Not worth the money.,24092,2
24093,The pendant we got did not have any moon shape attached to it and looked nothing like what is shown here.,24093,2
24093,I was very disappointed in what I received.,24093,2
24094,I bought this for a present for my husband but may be sending back.,24094,2
24094,"He always wears a large for everything, but this hoodie was slightly shorter than a hoodie usually is, and so wide you could probably fit 2 of him in there.",24094,2
24094,I really don't understand why it is so wide.,24094,2
24094,I'm disappointed.,24094,2
24095,It's ok. Not real gems/stones,24095,2
24096,"Ordered an XL, not a Women's US XL, too small and not the length I was expecting.",24096,2
24097,I ordered one size up after reading other reviews but still had to send it back because it was too small.,24097,2
24098,i need an exchange,24098,2
24099,"Arrived promtly, but 34x32 size, my usual, was too small in both dimensions.",24099,2
24099,"Will probably replace them with ripstop cotton carpenter's pants, if still available, which fit fine when bought several years ago.",24099,2
24099,Carhartt needs to standardize its sizing!,24099,2
24099,!,24099,2
24100,"These were a great price for two pair, but you get what you pay for.",24100,2
24100,"If you wear them with something else, they might be OK, but for a pool (like a cement pool), they are awful.",24100,2
24100,The bottoms/soles shred after the first or second use.,24100,2
24100,If you are using them on a non-abrasive surface they might be OK.,24100,2
24100,"I did like that they were light and comfortable and I love the colors, but I ended up having to purchase a different pair.",24100,2
24101,The dress fits a little large and the top piece is way too small and I'm not big breasted.,24101,2
24101,"It looks like someone just cut a t-shirt in half, the material is not at all what I was expecting.",24101,2
24101,I really was looking forward for this outfit.,24101,2
24102,"Its too snug in the sleeves and if you're big breasted, beware back rolls.",24102,2
24102,The top will pull against your tatas and enhance any back fat trouble spot,24102,2
24103,I give it a two because it is very cute.,24103,2
24103,"Also because I'm 5'11"" and the height was too short cause most women are not my height.",24103,2
24103,But it fit in a very awkward way even taking the height factor out.,24103,2
24103,I'll never be able to wear it in public.,24103,2
24103,Overall I regret the purchase!,24103,2
24104,This dress runs vey small and see through on the top.,24104,2
24104,"Returning it unfortunately, I really wanted to like it.",24104,2
24104,Gave two stars for the design.,24104,2
24105,"it looks like the waist trimmer is a one piece, the bra is not included.",24105,2
24105,Fits way smaller than advertised.,24105,2
24106,I gave these a 5 Star review when I originally bought them about 2 years ago.,24106,2
24106,"After my most recent purchase, however, I had to update my review.",24106,2
24106,"The ones in my most recent purchase are much thinner than previous pairs, the rubber nubs are not as effective at keeping me from slipping.",24106,2
24106,I nearly fell waking across a vinyl floor!,24106,2
24106,"After just a week of wearing, the (not very useful) rubber grippers on the bottom are all falling off (at first I couldn't figure out what the small purple discs were that I kept finding on the carpet).",24106,2
24106,"I don't know if this was just a bad batch or, more likely, if they have changed manufacturers and/or are cutting corners on materials to save money.",24106,2
24106,"I guess I am going back to wearing the old, worn pair.",24106,2
24107,Very thin material!,24107,2
24107,Was damaged upon delivery..cost too much to return,24107,2
24108,"Utility type bag, Not Fashion quality or look.",24108,2
24109,Shorter than I expected from the picture.,24109,2
24109,Very thin jersey material.,24109,2
24110,Sent back.,24110,2
24110,"Looked nice, but bodice was not as long as pictured, so fit was off.",24110,2
24111,This tie was presented to me as a joke gift and I used it during one of the holiday parties I attended.,24111,2
24111,"The graphics printed on it are great, but the highlight is supposed to be the little electronic doo-hickey that, when pressed, lights up two LEDs and provide very tinny segments of holidays tunes.",24111,2
24111,This worked fine when I wore the tie initially and tested it.,24111,2
24111,"But, during the very first party I went to, the LEDs only worked the first time.",24111,2
24111,By the second time the button was pressed (i.e.,24111,2
24111,"the THIRD time this was used), the LEDs did not light up and the music?",24111,2
24111,"There were a few squeaks, but that's all.",24111,2
24111,How disappointing.,24111,2
24111,I'll use the tie since I do like the graphics.,24111,2
24111,But I will probably remove the electronics and hope that the LED holes are not too large and can be covered up somehow.,24111,2
24111,Too bad.,24111,2
24112,Bought this and 5 months later the zipper broke.,24112,2
24112,Beautiful product but cheap zipper.,24112,2
24113,"Looked really cheap, but I guess that's to be expected at that price.",24113,2
24113,Looked weird on me.,24113,2
24114,"First, I guess I probably should have read the description closer, but you don't get all of the colors shown here.",24114,2
24114,"I bought this set really hoping for the dark green bandana, and I didn't even get that one.",24114,2
24114,I didn't get either blue as well.,24114,2
24114,"I did like the light pink color, but overall, the colors were a huge disappointment.",24114,2
24114,Do not buy this set if you're hoping for a certain color.,24114,2
24114,"Second, the quality is awful.",24114,2
24114,"They are so thin they are transparent, and they are not a nice, cloth material.",24114,2
24114,Almost plasticy in fact.,24114,2
24114,"I supposed I should have expected that for the price, but most of my bandanas are inexpensive, about one dollar each, and I've never had a quality issue.",24114,2
24114,"All in all, a very disappointing purchase.",24114,2
24115,"Well cats and kittens, the old adage is true: you get what you pay for.",24115,2
24115,"If the ring didn't turn orange after a dozen wears, I would have given it 5 stars because initially I got several compliments on my ""silver"" jewelry.",24115,2
24115,"Unfortunately, the ""silver"" is only a thin coating of paint or enamel and, considering the super low price, and is covering God-knows-what combination of  metals that lie underneath (lead?).",24115,2
24115,"If you want the ring for fun, occasional use, then go for it--the price is right  But don't grow attached to it like I did because one day you'll look down and the cool, hippie-style, chunky, turquoise and silver ring suddenly looks like something you fished out of a gum ball machine; your finger is green and the silver is now a dull copper and grey color.",24115,2
24115,"I didn't bother contacting the seller because the price was so cheap, I was surprised it held up as long as it did.",24115,2
24116,did not look like picture.,24116,2
24117,Way to small for full-sized adults.,24117,2
24117,"Gave it to my daughters to try on(all pre-teen) it fit the tallest one (about 4'6"") really well, and it looks nice.",24117,2
24117,"However it was ordered for me, we had already gotten her summer clothes.",24117,2
24117,They don't get worn as much as what she picked out.,24117,2
24118,Cheap and fade quickly.,24118,2
24118,You get what you pay for.,24118,2
24118,They are disposable like many other cheap and similar jewelry items on Amazon.,24118,2
24118,I usually wear them once for an event and toss.,24118,2
24119,Not good enough,24119,2
24120,Beautiful dress.,24120,2
24120,Horrible zipper.,24120,2
24120,I had trouble getting the zipper all the way up.,24120,2
24120,I have only worn it once for that reason.,24120,2
24120,The zipper seems extremely flimsy.,24120,2
24120,I have even tried the zipper without actually having the dress on and even then the zipper was hard to manipulate.,24120,2
24120,Overall it was a complete waste.,24120,2
24120,I have to look into replacing the zipper,24120,2
24121,its ok but the magnetic tab to close it broke the very first week.,24121,2
24121,and it doesn't have opening for ID pic,24121,2
24122,Cool pattern.,24122,2
24122,Slightly too baggy around the ankles.,24122,2
24122,The elastic waist cuts into belly fat making an undesirable double belly pooch.,24122,2
24122,I would only recommend these pants if you already have washboard abs or if you have no issues wearing shapewear underneath.,24122,2
24123,"After two washes, the graphic is cracked and peeling off.",24123,2
24123,Disappointing as my son loves this shirt.,24123,2
24124,Fabric is cheap!,24124,2
24124,But I can't really expect it to be super nice when I didn't pay that much for it.,24124,2
24125,The swimsuit looked as it is described.,24125,2
24125,However it was too large for me.,24125,2
24126,The i hooks pull out and bend very easily.,24126,2
24126,Actually a few broke after two days.,24126,2
24127,"I'm a size 10, tall, c cup.",24127,2
24127,The bathing suite is beautiful but was approximately 2 sizes to small.,24127,2
24127,"So because it did not fit, I gave 2 stars.",24127,2
24128,too large but kept cost too to mail back,24128,2
24129,"It looked great except at the arm pits, it pooched down and it went from sexy to saggy.",24129,2
24130,"This product is not satin, its almost exclusively polyester.",24130,2
24130,"With that said it's a decent dress, nothing to write home about.",24130,2
24130,It kind of makes you feel like a child in the funny fabrics.,24130,2
24131,They are cute and fits as expected.,24131,2
24131,( tried on over underwear).,24131,2
24131,I washed them and they came completely Un hemmed.,24131,2
24131,They are now in a land fill !,24131,2
24131,Disappointed.,24131,2
24132,"If you are busty, this is not for you.",24132,2
24132,Returned it.,24132,2
24133,This dress was very thin and somewhat small.,24133,2
24133,I bought it for my daughter to wear to Hawaii but she did not like it and we sent it back.,24133,2
24133,My daughter wears a misses size 8.,24133,2
24134,Poor quality,24134,2
24135,FAR too small.,24135,2
24135,NOT usa size by any stretch of the imagination.,24135,2
24135,Order at least 2-3 sizes bigger than you'd normally wear.,24135,2
24136,I ordered the apple green shirt.,24136,2
24136,Starters completely different tie then in the picture not complaining really because it is a better looking tie.,24136,2
24136,Anyways.,24136,2
24136,They put sewing pins everywhere so now there are holes EVERYWHERE and are VERY noticeable.,24136,2
24136,Not to mention the hole in the shirt.,24136,2
24136,I  am very unhappy with this & will not be ordering from them again.,24136,2
24136,I will be returning.,24136,2
24137,lovely dress runs small.,24137,2
24137,Buy 2 size up,24137,2
24138,The shipping time was decent.,24138,2
24138,"The product however, it quickly fell apart.",24138,2
24138,The card slots ripped and I was soon searching for another wallet.,24138,2
24138,The zip for the change compartment was very hard to work.,24138,2
24138,"Although it didn't matter, coins were constantly falling out.",24138,2
24138,I recommend finding a different one.,24138,2
24139,The size is right but that's it.,24139,2
24139,One of the rivets came out after 2 days.,24139,2
24139,It's starting to get frayed around some of the others.,24139,2
24139,Not happy,24139,2
24140,thick material and too big...,24140,2
24140,I'm usually a size medium I needed to get a smaller size.,24140,2
24140,Nice color though.,24140,2
24141,Very thin material.,24141,2
24141,If worn in daylight it's see through.,24141,2
24141,May not matter to some but I wore a slip with it,24141,2
24142,The denim was a little thinner than I expected so it doesn't feel like a jacket.,24142,2
24142,It feels more like a shirt.,24142,2
24143,"When I received this tie, I found the green background of the tie was green with tiny white stripes, rather than the solid green I was expecting.",24143,2
24143,"Otherwise, it looked fine, but I will be returning it.",24143,2
24144,fits somewhat crooked defective maybe the word,24144,2
24145,"It fit good except across the top , I have large breast and it was too loose on top left a big gap to see down thru, but I think the next size down would be to small everywhere else.",24145,2
24146,lasted about a week,24146,2
24147,Super cute!,24147,2
24147,"But, sadly, the chain broke the first time I used it.",24147,2
24147,It snapped when I was putting the bag over my shoulder.,24147,2
24148,for my kids,24148,2
24149,Looks great; I enjoyed it for about 6 months then the magnet fell out of the metal connector which has rendered the bracelet useless.,24149,2
24150,Sized way too small.,24150,2
24150,Gave to my much smaller son.,24150,2
24151,poor quality,24151,2
24152,Way too small.,24152,2
24152,Had to send it back.,24152,2
24152,Very beautiful though!,24152,2
24152,!,24152,2
24153,I just did some alterations.,24153,2
24153,And it works.,24153,2
24154,Disappointed with this product.,24154,2
24154,They are very flimsy and do not stick very well.,24154,2
24154,"I have used other products that held tight, these are too thin and the adhesive is poor.",24154,2
24155,Top is much smaller than normal size.,24155,2
24156,It doesn't slouch on an average sized head,24156,2
24157,On a cell phone it's hard to tell but the image has been refined & well lit.,24157,2
24157,It's for my sister so she may like it's not a photo.,24157,2
24157,I've left it in the bag so I'm unsure about the shirt quality & size since some shirts overseas are sized smaller.,24157,2
24157,This was a great photo of Audrey Hepburn but the animation isn't as well as should be.,24157,2
24158,Ill fitting for any women with curves.,24158,2
24158,Picture is extremely misleading.,24158,2
24158,Straps are not long enough for anyone above 5 feet.,24158,2
24158,"Unlike most, I was not paid or given this product.",24158,2
24158,I would harken this product to something in the clearance section of Wal-Mart in its quality and form.,24158,2
24159,"This cap is too small in general, it will expand to fit any size head, but the cap structure it self only expands to about 7 1/4, any thing bigger than that and the strap in back bulges out and looks stupid.",24159,2
24159,"Material and build seems good, this cap is just not big enough for anyone that has a cap size larger 7-7.25.. i would expect it will fit women and youth great.",24159,2
24160,Measured and still was too small.,24160,2
24160,Has an odor that is over powering.,24160,2
24161,"while they fit, they are definitely tights not leggings.",24161,2
24161,You cannot wear them without covering your assests unless you want for people to see everything.,24161,2
24161,They also have a chemical odor to them.,24161,2
24162,It broke after 2 weeks of use.,24162,2
24163,"Cute skirt, however it just wasn't for me.",24163,2
24163,It flares more than I would have liked and was longer than expected.,24163,2
24163,Follow the sizing chart for the best fit.,24163,2
24164,Too small and flimsy.,24164,2
24164,"We purchased X-Large in Blue, and it fits my teen girl with shoe size 7-1/2, but she doesn't like it - not comfortable.. My shoe size is 8-1/2, and these X-Large shoes are too small for me, the toes are jammed, but there is 1/5 inch of empty space wrinkled at the heel.",24164,2
24164,We the are returning it.,24164,2
24165,"good fit
holes within first 3 washes, cheap quality",24165,2
24166,"Runs small, and is poorly made even for the price.",24166,2
24166,"Order up, and do not expect quality",24166,2
24167,cheesy looking,24167,2
24168,very bad Quality,24168,2
24169,I ordered an XL - I'd say it was a size 10-12.,24169,2
24169,Just be aware of how really small it is.,24169,2
24169,"Material feels wonderful, but I couldn't get it on.",24169,2
24169,I do wear a 16-XXL depending on the clothing.,24169,2
24169,"Thought that this material would be stretchy, but even stretchy wouldn't make it anything close to what I would think is an extra large.",24169,2
24170,"My last UGG Hobo Bag was awesome, so when it was time to replace it, I purchased this one.",24170,2
24170,Unfortunately the design of this bag is awful.,24170,2
24170,"It looks great sitting on a table, but the bottom is round and inflexible, which makes it hang off your shoulder at a weird angle that looks ridiculous.",24170,2
24170,I returned it and purchased from another designer.,24170,2
24171,Order size bigger,24171,2
24172,Very very small!,24172,2
24172,But the price was so low I couldn't send it back.,24172,2
24172,This will fit a large to 1x!,24172,2
24173,"It's soft and warm but poor quality, I just wear it 45 minutes and start tearing apart and didn't notice that my ass is showing until my mom told me.",24173,2
24173,So I'm going to send it back .,24173,2
24174,"Loved the fit, did exactly what I wanted.",24174,2
24174,Kept my back straight and core engaged all day at work.,24174,2
24174,"But on literally the second wear, the metal boning ripped through and proceeded to stabe me all day :(",24174,2
24175,This top looks better on the model than it did on myself.,24175,2
24175,And the fabric quality is thin and not attractive at all.,24175,2
24175,I will give it away.,24175,2
24175,:(,24175,2
24176,I sent it back.,24176,2
24176,Too large for me.t,24176,2
24177,Thin.,24177,2
24177,Practically see through.,24177,2
24177,Pay close attention to the underwear you wear...it will probably been seen.,24177,2
24178,The color is actually more of a salmon than orange like I was expecting,24178,2
24179,Lovely style but too smsll,24179,2
24180,"It was great the first time I wore it, now it won't click into place.",24180,2
24180,It actually got stuck in my nose for a few minutes because it closed to the side of where it's actually supposed to.,24180,2
24180,It looks like the hinge wore out already.,24180,2
24181,Honestly not what I was expecting.,24181,2
24181,He length is a bit strange as the top layer has to be a choker to be able to see bottom strand - I may try to modify it.,24181,2
24181,Bottom disk also looks cheap because metal is incredibly thin fractions of a mm.,24181,2
24181,Very unlikely I wear this but it was very inexpensive so not a big loss.,24181,2
24182,I really like this dress problem is it's see though material is very thin.,24182,2
24182,Disappointed.,24182,2
24183,Cute but zipper broke within a month.,24183,2
24183,Loved it when I used it tho,24183,2
24184,The fit was good the material is weird (which I knew they were printed when I ordered) but I think the shiny and not really blue jean blue are what threw me.,24184,2
24185,Very cheap looking.,24185,2
24185,Returned.,24185,2
24186,"Not great quality, runs extremely small but the seller is more than fair and would buy from them again...with caution.",24186,2
24187,These are not men's socks.,24187,2
24188,Bigger sizes should have a longer length.,24188,2
24188,I need to sweat the fat below.,24188,2
24189,"If they were any more expensive, I would have given a 1.",24189,2
24189,"Gave it a 2 due to its price, so it obviously does not have me all that upset.",24189,2
24189,Bought these 4 months ago.,24189,2
24189,Today my fianc shows me this.,24189,2
24189,They looked beautiful while they lasted though lol,24189,2
24190,Strange fit.,24190,2
24190,Short and wide.,24190,2
24191,"I usually wear small, but ordered medium n still too tight.",24191,2
24192,a little too small.,24192,2
24193,These were extremely beautiful when they came in.,24193,2
24193,"I bought it as a gift for my mother, and she wore it from Christmas to this day.",24193,2
24193,"However, the biggest downfall to this item is that the color eventually faded and now instead of purple, it's just clear.",24193,2
24193,"I'm really disappointed in that, and my mother claims she still likes it, but seeing as how purple is her favorite color, that's why I bought it.",24193,2
24194,I bought this shirt a few months ago and the dinosaur is flaked now.,24194,2
24194,"I wash it as directed, inside out, and still.",24194,2
24194,Total bummer.,24194,2
24194,It fits great and is soft.,24194,2
24194,I loved this shirt.,24194,2
24194,Give it a few more months and I'll be the proud owner of a soft plain black t-shirt.,24194,2
24195,It's not as good as it looks in the picture.,24195,2
24195,The shape is very odd and doesn't look good.,24195,2
24196,way too big & no way to fix it.,24196,2
24196,Returned!,24196,2
24197,Womens small fit like a women's large.,24197,2
24197,If j wear them on my hips I have about 1 and a half feet of crotch Room and the pant legs bag.,24197,2
24197,I'm 5'3 and unless you are tall these will not fit.,24197,2
24197,These are more along the lines of men's small.,24197,2
24197,Luckily they are soft and I know how to sew alterations.,24197,2
24198,Too large for my 5 & 3 yrs old,24198,2
24199,I like the watch but I had problems wearing it because I could not fasten the bracelet.,24199,2
24200,Didn't realize it was all one piece looks like something out of the 80's.,24200,2
24200,Very disappointed,24200,2
24201,Cheap and I should have known given the price and it's way too big!,24201,2
24202,Not as cute as they seem online.,24202,2
24202,"The quality of the fabric is really cheap, but then again, so is the price.",24202,2
24202,"Ultimately, you get what you pay for.",24202,2
24202,"However, after trying them on once, I have never worn them but I did keep them ""just in case.""",24202,2
24202,"It seems like they would be a good addition to a Halloween costume or something, not to wear to the gym or for the heck of it.",24202,2
24202,They just look too cheap.,24202,2
24203,This is a lovely skirt if they had not but it right in the middle in the back so your behind looks bigger than it is when you are wearing it.,24203,2
24204,So disappointed in this shirt!,24204,2
24204,"Not only was it small (ordered a size 6 it fit like a small size 5) and odd fitting (very narrow, but long); the design is for babies/toddlers with snaps at the neck of the shirt.",24204,2
24205,"It's super cute but is really quite cheap (not that I expected different, given the price).",24205,2
24205,The chain is terrible.,24205,2
24205,"If you order this, be prepared to check every link for gaps before you even think about wearing it.",24205,2
24205,"If you're fortunate enough to have tiny wrists, like myself, and don't mind wearing the brace 24/7, you can bypass the chain entirely, rip it off, and just use the hook on the metal bracket that the individual bracelet pieces together, it's lovely.",24205,2
24205,"However, that doesn't make it REALLY difficult to put on if you don't have help.",24205,2
24205,"Over all, meh.",24205,2
24205,It's cute.,24205,2
24206,"This robe is huge and heavy, not a waffle light weight spa robe.",24206,2
24207,"It was beautiful, but extremely large on me.",24207,2
24208,The snap is very feeble and difficult to open and close because it is not well made.,24208,2
24208,The ring is also decently large.,24208,2
24208,If you have a petite nose or face this is not for you.,24208,2
24209,It's more light skin colored a peach hint,24209,2
24210,Fits really tight compared to other hats,24210,2
24211,"Ran somewhat large, but stayed on my feet once I was strapped in.",24211,2
24211,"Made for wide feet, if you have narrow feet like me there will be extra space on the sides.",24211,2
24211,"Also, picture makes them look taller than they really are.",24211,2
24211,They're more long rather than tall.,24211,2
24211,Heel is maybe 4 inches tall.,24211,2
24212,they catch on collars and scarfs and easily come off.,24212,2
24212,I went by the measurements but they run big.,24212,2
24212,Wouldn't purchase again.,24212,2
24213,"not really what I expected,material is not soft at all.....",24213,2
24214,This product was just okay for the price.,24214,2
24214,It runs a little on the small side and it doesn't seem to be made of durable material.,24214,2
24214,Where I live it rains at least 260 days a year so I need a raincoat that will be able to handle some wear and tear.,24214,2
24214,For the price this just didn't seem to be the right one.,24214,2
24215,"Not only was it too  small and short but it seemed to be made very cheap and was pressed in a akward spot, making the shirt not look symmetrical",24215,2
24216,"Too big, the pink is a lot paler than the color shown.",24216,2
24216,The price was cheap so I didn't return it.,24216,2
24216,We have a pool so I put it in the swim bin for others to use.,24216,2
24217,Too small in the chest back and under the arms and super long in the back and I even ordered a size up.,24217,2
24218,Loved how it looked on.,24218,2
24218,"Fit great, very flattering BUT a seam was coming undone and the hangy strap across the back of the neck was just hanging on by a thread.",24218,2
24218,Literally.,24218,2
24219,the dress not what i expected,24219,2
24220,Difficult to use and the teeth were VERY large for a small size.,24220,2
24221,This brief did not fit me as I expected.,24221,2
24221,The waist band had too much material to it.,24221,2
24221,I wouldn't purchase another one of these.,24221,2
24222,"The vest was well made and quite attractive, altogether smaller than expected.",24222,2
24222,3XL usually fits me very well.,24222,2
24223,"It does not flow that easily and is red, not orange, also no blue; the colors are red, black and brown.",24223,2
24224,Zipper handles shoddy.,24224,2
24224,"Two have broken in 18 months of light use, hand carried by me,.",24224,2
24225,The shirt pattern and cut has a feminine quality about it that I was not comfortable with.,24225,2
24225,"It is cut very short, tapered, and on the small side.",24225,2
24225,I bought a size up from what I normally wear and it was still too small.,24225,2
24225,The color and gold highlights might work for some but not for me.,24225,2
24225,My wife did not like it.,24225,2
24225,I like colorful Hawaiian shirts but this one does not look Hawaiian at all.,24225,2
24226,"While the organizer is nice, I found that after using it in my Longchamp Le Pliage large tote for about 6 months, it started to not hold its shape and cave in on itself.",24226,2
24226,"I have actively been looking for another alternative because, while I like this insert, its just not holding up over time.",24226,2
24227,The fabric is nice but the cut is wrong because the front just meets at one spot then the front is cut back.,24227,2
24227,It would be better if the front was not so shaped and instead hung down straight.,24227,2
24227,It is not a cover up because it does not cover your front at all.,24227,2
24227,I ordered an extra large but there is nothing large about it.,24227,2
24227,It barely met at the widest part of the front.,24227,2
24228,This jacket's arms were so short i almost thought it was supposed to be short sleeved.,24228,2
24228,"the jacket also just didn't look quality like it did in the picture.the sequins were fine , i have no complaints about them.",24228,2
24228,The quality of the jacket just wasn't up to my standart and the arms were definitly a let down being that short.,24228,2
24229,Was very tight and mich too long.,24229,2
24230,Cheaply made product.,24230,2
24230,Stones missing.,24230,2
24230,Turned my finger green after 2 days.,24230,2
24231,Not a fan of the material.,24231,2
24231,Cheap,24231,2
24232,"Snags easily,",24232,2
24233,This coat is gorgeous.,24233,2
24233,"That being said, when mine arrived one of the buttons had come off and the seams had loose threads.",24233,2
24233,"All very fixable, but I ordered a 2XL and my 5'2"" 125 pound mother-in-law couldn't fit into it, it was so tight she could only put one arm in.",24233,2
24233,To say it is sized small is a gross understatement.,24233,2
24233,"I checked the tag, and unless they mislabeled this coat there is no way an adult human could ever fit into one of these.",24233,2
24233,"It really is a shame, because other than insane sizing and poor quality control this was a very pretty coat and seemed like it would have been very warm.",24233,2
24234,It ripped within the first week of owning it.,24234,2
24234,Its cheaply made.,24234,2
24234,Wouldnt really reccomend.,24234,2
24235,This was the second pair of these I had ordered i ordered one in charcoal in XL and they fit perfectly but the navy is to tight in the waist and is not an XL more like size LG.,24235,2
24235,I'm so sad that the navy didn't fit properly as I would have purchased  more in different  colors but these pants are not consistent in there sizing don't want to chance it.,24235,2
24236,way too small and too tight,24236,2
24237,It came with one side completely broken off!!!,24237,2
24237,!,24237,2
24238,"Low-quality material, sloppy stitching, thin and not warm.",24238,2
24238,"There are buttoned flaps on the front, but they're fake; not pockets.",24238,2
24238,"There are zipper pockets behind the flaps, and one of the pocket's linings had a hole in it.",24238,2
24238,"Overall, a thinly and sloppily constructed coat.",24238,2
24239,style doesn't look as nice in real life as it does on pictures,24239,2
24240,I should have read the material label.,24240,2
24240,Is mostly spandex... And I don't like spandex just cotton.,24240,2
24240,But is a pretty dress that I will donate.,24240,2
24240,My fault.,24240,2
24240,Thx,24240,2
24241,Not what I was looking for.,24241,2
24241,Very firm and not comfortable.,24241,2
24241,I was looking for more cushion.,24241,2
24242,Came all squished and folded :(,24242,2
24243,i like it enough to buy again in larger side,24243,2
24244,Bottoms were very small.,24244,2
24244,Top was not a deep V. Not as cute as in the picture.,24244,2
24245,poor quality and poor fit.,24245,2
24245,You get what you pay for.,24245,2
24246,To small very Disapointment cause is very nice,24246,2
24247,I'm petite and this was still WAY too short.,24247,2
24247,Nice as a long sweater over leggings.,24247,2
24247,"Not only was it way too short to be a dress, the material is way too tight to be ""One Size Fits All"".",24247,2
24247,I'll keep it because it's nice as a tunic/long sweater.,24247,2
24248,Too tight in all the wrong places :( I ordered Large and I am generally a small and they still are too tight.,24248,2
24248,Don't recommend.,24248,2

24250,You have to have pencil arms...lol,24250,2
24251,It was coming apart at the same when I first got it.,24251,2
24251,"On top of that, it didn't fit my curvy body shape well.",24251,2
24252,"They are beautiful and looked good on me, they just irritated my ears immediately after putting them on.",24252,2
24252,"I do have sensitive ears, my daughter is able to wear them.",24252,2
24253,It was way to small.,24253,2
24253,Wasted all my money and time for it to come .,24253,2
24254,Broke in less than a day when I was taking it off...,24254,2
24255,I loved this shirt when I first got it.,24255,2
24255,Then I washed it ONCE and the color on the print flacked off.,24255,2
24256,Not what I expected.,24256,2
24256,Fit very tight.,24256,2
24256,Material is cheap and it's complicated to put on.,24256,2
24256,Waste of money.,24256,2
24257,This dress did not fit!,24257,2
24257,It went to right below my butt!,24257,2
24257,And was completely see through!,24257,2
24258,Not comfortable.,24258,2
24259,This bracelet broke after wearing it once!,24259,2
24260,"It fit the way it was supposed to, and slimmed my waist.",24260,2
24260,I got it to use for work outs.,24260,2
24260,"Had no problem when on an exercise bike, walking or running.",24260,2
24260,"When it came to doing ab workouts, it bunched up a bit, not unlike a short would.",24260,2
24260,I just pulled it down.,24260,2
24260,"I had used it in my routine for few weeks, and noticed a difference.",24260,2
24260,However the zipper suddenly broke (did the whole zip up while also unzipping thing).,24260,2
24260,"I managed to get it to zip properly again, but any time after that when I bent down to pick something up, the zipper split again.",24260,2
24261,Buckle is good quality but the belt it self isn't.,24261,2
24262,Both were too big.,24262,2
24262,Did not reorder a smaller size as suites looked cheap also.,24262,2
24263,Bottoms were really small.,24263,2
24264,"Cheap, but it served its purpose for a Halloween costume.",24264,2
24264,The top of the hat near the top the seam is starting to come apart.,24264,2
24265,I did not receive the same shirt as in the picture.,24265,2
24265,"It is extremely similar, but the v-neck on mine stops about two inches above the bra-line, in the picture, it goes 2 or more below.",24265,2
24265,Note - I do not have large breasts that are pulling the shirt up.,24265,2
24265,"I am a 32C (about the same as  34B), I weigh 110, 5'4"", and I ordered a small in black.",24265,2
24265,"It's ok I guess, I might keep it, but it isn't what I wanted.",24265,2
24266,"Small, bad quality",24266,2
24267,I'm looking for a wedding dress and this one is bigger even I usually wear size 4.,24267,2
24268,Fit too tight on head,24268,2
24269,looks really cheap,24269,2
24270,Not Wide Enough!!!,24270,2
24270,!,24270,2
24271,Sleeves are too tight.,24271,2
24272,I like the idea but the product is just too short for my torso.,24272,2
24272,"I don't have a long torso to begin with, this is from China and the sizing is extremely small.",24272,2
24272,I have to pick between back fat hanging out it extra muffin top.,24272,2
24272,Lol.,24272,2
24272,"This also rides up a lot, I wore it while I was at a convention, since I was going to be on my feet all day and not sit down for it to roll, oh but it did.",24272,2
24272,"When I wear it, it looks great but anything longer than an hour or sitting down, it will roll.",24272,2
24273,Was dissapointed on the quality of the chain.,24273,2
24273,Does not look like picture to me.,24273,2
24274,Wore for a few hours on one day and it tarnished/turned bronze.,24274,2
24274,"Cute for a picture or two, but don't expect it to last any longer than that - I got one use out of it and it was toast.",24274,2
24275,Not true to size,24275,2
24276,These were so small you couldn't hardly see the stone.,24276,2
24277,I knew it wasn't going to be exactly as the picture and it's not even close to being.,24277,2
24277,I had seen other reviews saying it wasn't nothing compared to the picture I chose lime green sweatshirt it was a forest green color I only wanted a sweatshirt  i was expecting this forest green color and i wanted it so i really didn't want the lime green color.,24277,2
24277,So I had everything plan out but it's nothing like the picture so If your expecting something exactly like this don't buy I only wanted a common sweatshirt,24277,2
24278,This shirt was way too huge for a large.,24278,2
24278,I'm not a fan!,24278,2
24279,Not as nice as the other pieces I purchased.,24279,2
24279,"The pattern was stamped, low quality, ok for the price.",24279,2

24285,SWIM!,24285,2
24285,"not that I was hoping for it to be skin tight or anything, but seriously two of me can fit in here, easily.",24285,2
24285,thankfully I have a number of skinny pants and high waste skirts to make this work.,24285,2
24285,this is still completely laughable.,24285,2
24285,really.,24285,2
24286,Not as expected.,24286,2

24289,"nice stone necklace, needs better images.",24289,2
24289,It is large and smelled like diesel fuel.,24289,2
24290,"I got a medium, it fits me up on top but on the bottom it flares out and it's a little shorter than what I'm comfortable with.",24290,2
24291,Sent back.,24291,2
24291,Too large and no small available,24291,2
24292,"Too small, too short and itchy material.",24292,2
24293,I saw everyone's reviews and went a size larger than I normally am and the medium bottoms do not fit me still.,24293,2
24293,But the material is nice and it looks just like the picture shown.,24293,2
24293,So I'm satisfied about everything but the size of the bottoms.,24293,2
24293,:) ps.,24293,2
24293,I'm like a size 2.,24293,2
24294,It does not fir,24294,2
24295,Shaft and ball pouch is in a odd place higher than it should be makes them fit weird still fun and sexy wife can't keep her hands off when I wear them,24295,2
24296,Seams split 3rd time my son wore them.,24296,2
24296,Cheap quality,24296,2

24299,"hate, loose and flimsy, uncomfortable",24299,2
24300,Very cheap material and is not as flowly as it seems,24300,2
24301,too short for me.,24301,2
24302,These are poor quality.,24302,2
24302,You get what you pay for.,24302,2
24303,I have a love-hate relationship with this skirt.,24303,2
24303,"It's cute, but it's constantly falling apart.",24303,2
24303,"When I got it, there were stray strands of thread everywhere, parts of the skirt were not sewn, and I had to sew it up myself.",24303,2
24303,"Since then, every time I wear it, some other part of it comes apart and has to be sewn again.",24303,2
24303,It's cheap and not very well made.,24303,2
24303,"Unless you're willing to keep up with the repairs, I'd recommend springing for one of the more expensive options that might be better made, or making your own.",24303,2
24304,The dress is very pretty.,24304,2
24304,It has a wedding gown look and feel.,24304,2
24304,We followed the sizing guide and the dress bodice was too small everywhere.,24304,2
24304,"It also fit a little strange at the neckline, riding up pretty high.",24304,2
24305,It's Ok I wasn't all that impressed.. You get what you pay for sometimes.,24305,2
24305,If you have thick hair this hat might be tight..I order 3 hats one hat was smaller than the others 2 out of three fit as expected.,24305,2
24305,Looked frumpy on Me..so cute on other people.,24305,2
24306,"This purse is ok ,but it was listed with the conceal carry purses and it is not.",24306,2
24306,It's misleading when you type in conceal carry purse and this one popped up!,24306,2
24307,this 3X blouse was way too small i always wear a 3X my niece wants the blouse because it almost fit her small frame,24307,2
24308,It was WAY too short.,24308,2
24308,Could be a shirt.,24308,2
24309,Way Too Big!,24309,2
24309,and no elastic to keep it on the head..,24309,2
24310,Is not good.,24310,2
24310,Part.,24310,2
24311,If you have a muffin top it'll make it look worse,24311,2
24312,"this jacket is made in asia, but has operations in the usa, asians are smaller than americans so there measurements aren't the same.",24312,2
24312,there mediums (for men) are equivalent to american small.,24312,2
24313,"Pretty, but was tarnished when I received it",24313,2
24314,"I ordered a large and when I tried it on, it fit fine but it was a lot shorter than I expected.",24314,2
24314,It ends in the middle of my shins.,24314,2
24314,The fabric is cheap so the price makes sense.,24314,2
24314,It is a cute dress but probably won't get too many opportunities to wear it/wash it.,24314,2
24315,Cheap.,24315,2
24315,Cheap.,24315,2
24315,Cheap.,24315,2
24316,Follow the size charge and the sizing will work out just right.,24316,2
24316,"I am 5'2"" 120 pounds- I can't remember what size I bought but it should say just above my review.",24316,2
24316,"However, I felt like this suit made me look very short waisted.",24316,2
24316,No thanks!,24316,2
24316,I ended up returning it for a high waisted bikini that is far more flattering.,24316,2
24317,Looked nice.,24317,2
24317,But broke when I took them out.,24317,2
24318,This case has come apart.,24318,2
24318,And it was a gift.,24318,2
24319,I can use it,24319,2
24320,They are bigger than regular prosthesis.,24320,2
24321,I bought this boots almost 2 months ago (march) and still  cannot wear them.,24321,2
24321,The smell is horrible.,24321,2
24321,I Just hope the smell will be gone by next winter.,24321,2
24322,"Very pretty in photo, looks like a nightgown.",24322,2
24323,This product feel like plastic.,24323,2
24323,I thought it would have a metal feeling.,24323,2
24323,The bracelet is dull and not as shiny as it looks in the picture.,24323,2
24324,CHEAP LOOKING,24324,2
24325,These run small - especially the feet.,24325,2
24325,And both my boys said the feet are scratchy and uncomfortable.,24325,2
24326,The bottom barely fit.,24326,2
24326,The top not at all.,24326,2
24326,Very small doesn't fit as the picture would assume.,24326,2
24327,It fit small.u would need to size up two time your regular size.,24327,2
24327,Love the material.,24327,2
24328,"eh, tight everywhere, thin material...sent it back",24328,2
24329,Would have been nice if it was a set but to ther then that there good,24329,2
24330,Smaller than expected,24330,2
24331,The item was perfect!,24331,2
24331,Until I tried it on :( I couldn't fit and expensive to ship back to China.,24331,2
24331,I,24331,2
24332,"I liked the quality of the red material, but it was WAY TOO SHORT!",24332,2
24332,"Everything fit pretty well, butthe center of the plunge was well below my belly button and tied up it just looked ridiculous.",24332,2
24332,"I normally wear a size M-L  and I do have a longer torso, but I've never come across something this short though",24332,2
24333,"Quality was not there, small rips in the embroidery, slit and embroidery did not match...  made it look as if the embroidery was pointing in the wrong direction...",24333,2
24333,Thought maybe it was a bad run so we ordered a second without much improvement.,24333,2
24333,sorry but overall a NO GO,24333,2
24334,Not a low profile hat,24334,2
24335,The bottom of the t-shirt keeps rolling up.,24335,2
24335,Once I washed it it shrunk a little.,24335,2
24336,When I read a review saying buy a size bigger I was expecting the 3X to fit perfect.,24336,2
24336,To my dismay it was still too small.,24336,2
24336,I guess it's more incentive to move more.,24336,2
24336,Lol,24336,2
24337,They don't have a band.,24337,2
24337,You have to stick your ear into the mitts.,24337,2
24337,I didn't realize that at the time of purchase.,24337,2
24337,The don't stay on.,24337,2
24337,They will drop off.,24337,2
24337,"Some what of an inconvenience walking, in the cold.",24337,2
24337,Having to deal with trying to keep your ears warm.,24337,2
24338,Stitching came apart after wearing to sleep twice.,24338,2
24338,"The silk is nice, though - it helped cool me off in the night when it was hot.",24338,2
24339,Damage in one time use,24339,2
24340,The shirts are completely see-through.,24340,2
24340,I can literally see my belly button through them.,24340,2
24340,I am returning them.,24340,2
24340,Definitely not worth what I paid.,24340,2
24341,"This is an averaged score, as I love one of the four of these shirts that I ordered.",24341,2
24341,"If they were all like the vintage turquoise one I received, this would be a five-star review.",24341,2
24341,"Unfortunately, the h charcoal, black, and white shirts I ordered were not scoop-neck shirts, but v-neck shirts, and the materials were not consistent.",24341,2
24341,I really need scoop-neck tees in order to wear them with sweaters with more generous neck-lines.,24341,2
24341,"The vintage turquoise one I ordered is a nice, soft 50% poly 25% cotton 25% rayon jersey fabric.",24341,2
24341,The white is 95% cotton 5% spandex.,24341,2
24341,"The black and gray are 92% cotton 8%spandex, So those three are being returned.",24341,2
24341,"I do wish I could get scoop-neck shirts in those colors, preferably in the poly-cotton-rayon jersey blend, but I'd settle just for the neck-line as advertised.",24341,2
24341,"If I could, this would be a 5 star review, as I really like the one that is actually as described.",24341,2
24342,"I ordered a medium but received an XL, which actually fit like a medium.",24342,2
24342,"Very cheap material, but still sort of fits well.",24342,2
24342,"Not what I expected, but not terrible either.",24342,2
24343,It was more shear than I thought and isn't as long as it looks in the picture.,24343,2
24343,I ordered for winter but its not warm at all,24343,2
24344,Too light - has no weight to it!,24344,2
24344,!,24344,2
24345,Nothing like the picture,24345,2
24346,There is a ton of padding in the top and no way to pull it out.,24346,2
24346,Reminds me of a teenager push up bra.,24346,2
24347,"So it just came in
Everything else looks great but mine didn't have the logo on the back of the hat like displayed in the order.",24347,2
24347,Kinda disappointed about that.,24347,2
24347,Is there any way to send it back and get one like the one displayed?,24347,2
24348,this item will not stay in position...junk,24348,2
24349,"I was hoping that the gown would be long, but I am 5'10"", and it is not long at all.",24349,2
24349,"The material is very stiff and it should soften, once it has been washed.",24349,2
24350,The length from crotch to waist or even hips was much too small.,24350,2
24350,Or maybe my butt is much too larger.,24350,2
24350,Probably the latter.,24350,2
24351,very light and thin weight.,24351,2
24352,"The straps that go over the shoulders, were not made for this dress.",24352,2
24352,The best way to get rid of them would either be to tuck them in or remove them.,24352,2
24352,"The pads they have in there for the boobs, are as hard as a rock and can't be moved or removed.",24352,2
24352,"The lace up in the back took over 45 minutes to do, and on the bottom, it bunched up by the tailbone, making it very uncomfortable to wear.",24352,2
24352,"The length was perfect with 5"" heels and I'm 5'4""!",24352,2
24352,!,24352,2
24353,We had to sew the straps down in the back so that the front actually covered her private chest area.,24353,2
24353,So tired of products made this way.,24353,2
24354,I normally wear a L w comfy room so I bought an XL just to be safe.,24354,2
24354,It was so small it was more like a medium.,24354,2
24354,Make sure you go up.,24354,2
24355,"I thought it would be made of plastic, but it is just a paper mask.",24355,2
24355,Lesson learned.,24355,2
24356,After reading the reviews for this jacket I decided to buy a large ( I normally wear a small\medium) as everyone claims the size runs small.,24356,2
24356,I was disappointed to find out that the large was too big for me.,24356,2
24356,Instead of going through the hassle of sending it back I have decided to get it altered.,24356,2
24357,This is ridiculously small!!,24357,2
24357,The ONLY reason it got 2 stars is because of the cute print.,24357,2
24357,I ordered a large and I normally wear a large some xlarge (depending on brand) and this fits more like a womans small.,24357,2
24357,Way too small!,24357,2
24358,It just looked somewhat cheaply made.,24358,2
24359,"Had it  for a month and it is falling apart,stitches are breaking and magnet closure is splitting.",24359,2
24359,"It's very cute, you get what you pay for it.",24359,2
24360,It's not lined,24360,2
24361,i bought this item 3 times my size and it was still too small.,24361,2
24361,"It took over a month to receive it, so I didn't bother to send it back.",24361,2
24362,Did not fit correct.,24362,2
24362,"Too large in the bust,  extra material in the mid section and a touch to short in front.",24362,2
24362,Super thick material.,24362,2
24362,Seller was easy to communicate with though.,24362,2
24363,Worked ok for a one night event.,24363,2
24363,The cups fit well but the privacy panel in the back is very narrow.,24363,2
24363,If you need more than about two inches between the sides while lacing you will have to alter the privacy panel.,24363,2
24363,Also the sequins and stones are not fastened on well.,24363,2
24363,Took it to the dry cleaner and half the stones fell off and then melted to the dress.,24363,2
24363,Pretty much ruined it.,24363,2
24363,Consider it a one time event throw away dress.,24363,2
24364,"The quality of this bag is OK for the price, it seems like it will last more than a month.",24364,2
24364,My big problem with it are the pictures.,24364,2
24364,"This bag is not blue as pictured, it's basically black unless it's under direct bright light, and even then it's very dark blue, unlike the picture.",24364,2
24364,"It's also smaller than pictured, an iPhone plus cannot fit standing upright in this bag.",24364,2
24364,I'd have been happy with it if the picture were more representative of the product.,24364,2
24365,"I love it, I removed one star because it did fall off about twice, I had to put it back together.",24365,2
24365,"Nonetheless, I do love it.",24365,2
24365,Returned and gave a lower rating because it broke once again and I am unable to repair it.,24365,2
24366,I have diastasis recti and this helps me feel more stable and put together when I'm working out.,24366,2
24366,However it is super hard to put on myself and would be better if there were two separate pieces that came across.,24366,2
24366,It gets bunched easily when I try to Velcro it myself but it is fine if my husband helps.,24366,2
24366,It does not conform well to my body though and I get painful red lines at my waistline after wearing it for an hour or so.,24366,2
24366,I would also like it a lot more if it were longer and covered my torso completely.,24366,2
24367,Pin is very small and chain is short.,24367,2
24367,Not worth $25.,24367,2
24368,"While the cut is nice, the white is 100% see through",24368,2
24369,"I use it every day but the buckle broke apart after a year and a half, and now not covered by warranty",24369,2
24370,Quality is great.,24370,2
24370,But bra cup is truly small for size.,24370,2
24371,Broke afer 2 weeks,24371,2
24372,Jewelry looked very cheap and used.,24372,2
24372,Picture was much nicer,24372,2
24373,It feels like something you would buy at a costume store.,24373,2
24373,But it's pretty.,24373,2
24373,I don't recommend buying this item ',24373,2
24374,Not the color shown in the picture.,24374,2
24374,Bright cardinal red is not burgundy.,24374,2
24375,I fell in love with the first pair but the second was about 4 sizes smaller although they look the same.,24375,2
24375,Even the pair that fit was very fitting.,24375,2
24375,Maybe more for working out than going our in for me.,24375,2
24376,Item came damaged.,24376,2
24376,One of the earrings was not hooked up properly to the inside of the other loop.,24376,2
24376,Loop to connect the two was broken.,24376,2
24376,By the time I noticed it was too late to return.,24376,2
24376,"Update: 6/30/17
On a separate note, I repaired the loop myself and wore them a few times.",24376,2
24376,Only to end up with green/blue ear lobes and sore ones to boot.,24376,2
24376,Definitely two thumbs down!,24376,2
24377,WAY too big!,24377,2
24378,"While I like the look and size of the wallet, the price is too high for the quality.",24378,2
24378,It feels cheap.,24378,2
24378,"It should be $10 or maybe $15, not any higher than that.",24378,2
24378,I paid $27.00 and I definitely feel like I paid too much.,24378,2
24379,Looks a lot different at hand than online.,24379,2
24379,.. material used to make this dress n the skills used are poor!,24379,2
24379,This dress is horrible.,24379,2
24379,..,24379,2
24379,I want my money back.,24379,2
24379,..!,24379,2
24380,Follow the guidance of ordering 2-3 sizes up.,24380,2
24380,I'm typically a Women's XSmall-Small and I bought a Large.,24380,2
24380,"I was hoping this shirt could be easily dressed up with the right sweater, but it is much too casual.",24380,2
24380,I still will not be wearing it as a casual shirt because of the neckline.,24380,2
24380,The neck is too large and hangs open strangely (see picture).,24380,2
24380,"On the positive side, it's not too tight or too loose and the length is perfect.",24380,2
24381,Paint chips off,24381,2
24382,these are tiny.,24382,2
24382,probably works with a skinny tie only.,24382,2
24382,doesn't look right with a regular tie.,24382,2
24383,"These are gorgeous, but the reason I gave this item a ""2"" is because my lobster clasp was welded closed.",24383,2
24383,"Luckily, I make jewelry sometimes and had the tools to cut the bad clasp off and have a good quality one on hand and attach it.",24383,2
24383,"Otherwise, really pretty.",24383,2
24384,I returned this.,24384,2
24384,It was too big on my wrist and I didn't like the gold clasp.,24384,2
24385,Was disappointed with the quality.,24385,2
24386,The material is very thin and the shirt arrived with a hole in it.,24386,2
24387,"Love these, but I washed in cold water and found a run.",24387,2
24387,Very dissapointed!,24387,2
24387,Never even wore them out in town yet.,24387,2
24387,Sucks,24387,2
24388,I allways buy M in all of dresses but in this model i am L. Very very tight,24388,2
24389,Weird material!,24389,2
24389,"Almost like really thick opaque tights instead of spandex, and way way too small.",24389,2
24389,"I am a true medium through and through, in several other brands on Amazon as well, these ones seem XS!",24389,2
24389,I couldn't even get them over my knees!,24389,2
24389,!,24389,2
24390,It is very wide for me.,24390,2
24390,I am so disappointed!,24390,2
24391,Very ugly in person.,24391,2
24391,I ordered it with silver buttons and it came with very ugly plastic reddish-brown buttons instead.,24391,2
24392,"Thy would be a lot better if they had more support in the bulge/pouch area makes them seem small, mine already have 2 small holes from the middle seam ripping after wearing them once from being stretched.",24392,2
24393,"for 5'4"" and 138lbs it is like a slim fit short sweater, not like at the picture.",24393,2
24394,The quality isn't great.,24394,2
24394,Would be a cute shirt if it looked like the picture.,24394,2
24394,"The shirt I received, the bow on the back is sad and doesn't look like a bow at all, it looks like someone accidentally sewed a piece of scrap fabric to the back.",24394,2
24394,I know how to sew so I will fix it up myself so it looks nice.,24394,2
24394,But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,24394,2
24394,Looks nothing like the picture shown.,24394,2
24395,It doesn't fit on the top as it should.,24395,2
24395,It created a uni-boob look :/  I'm 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium was a little too tight for me.,24395,2
24395,The material is a strange stretchy fabric.,24395,2
24395,The color is as shown.,24395,2
24396,I received this item yesterday and is EXTREMELY small.,24396,2
24396,I am a medium and sometimes large (if it runs small) and I ordered a XXL and it fit me very tight (hardly fitted) and sleeves looks short.,24396,2
24397,"Heavy material, waist band to tight and wide.",24397,2
24397,Not a winner...,24397,2
24398,it turned brown after a week of wear indicating its not sterling silver.,24398,2
24399,Very cheap material,24399,2
24400,eh...,24400,2
24400,The other reviews are correct.,24400,2
24400,It does run very small.,24400,2
24400,"I'm a womens size 10 or 12, usually always a 10 in dresses.",24400,2
24400,"But I do have 36DD's so I wanted to make sure I have enough room, so I ordered the XXlarge.",24400,2
24400,And it did fit but the gap in between the breast was huge.,24400,2
24400,Also the sleeve went just below my elbows not to my wrist..,24400,2
24400,I'm almost 5'8 so maybe it will fit differently for shorter girls??,24400,2
24400,"its was flowing like photo, but overall the vibe was off and the fit fell short.",24400,2
24400,Not worth $40 in my opinion.,24400,2
24400,"the white is line,but still semi sheer.",24400,2
24401,Bottoms fit.,24401,2
24401,Top was small.,24401,2
24401,Also ripped very easily.,24401,2
24401,Only wore it once.,24401,2
24402,Super cute HOWEVER they run very small AND I was also sent the wrong size!,24402,2
24402,!,24402,2
24403,They run a bit small.,24403,2
24403,The largest size might be best suitable for a 10-11 year old.,24403,2
24404,Like the style yet all mediums fit great except this one.,24404,2
24405,"First and foremost, the fabric is really soft, stretchy, and flowy.",24405,2
24405,"For a skinny (aka small chested) woman, the dress may fit better.",24405,2
24405,"For women who are a bit curvier, this dress won't fit as well.",24405,2
24405,"It was tight on my breast (38DD) and waist, but baggy around the arm holes.",24405,2
24405,That may look okay with a cardigan over it.,24405,2
24405,Just make sure it's one of those short cardigans.,24405,2
24405,"The dress is fitted around the high waist but fluffy so it'll hide any ""imperfections"", so a long cardigan wouldn't look as well.",24405,2
24405,"I'm 5'10"" and the dress came right to the top of my knees.",24405,2
24405,"I normally wear a size L, but I ordered an XXL.",24405,2
24405,The dress fit well (a bit tight) everywhere except the arms.,24405,2
24405,I've attached a pic.,24405,2
24405,"If this review helped you, please click ""Yes"" so that other women will see it as well.",24405,2
24406,"These leggings were too small, I ordered a large since the review said the sizes ran small, and I normally wear a small in tights/leggings, and they were still too small.",24406,2
24406,"The print was nice, and material seems to be decent quality, but  I can't wear them as they barely come up above my knees.",24406,2
24407,I actually ordered a size bigger just incase but it's way too small.,24407,2
24407,Very disappointed cause it's a real pretty shirt just can't wear it.,24407,2
24408,"Like the style, but I couldn't even try it on, too small - maybe shirt was marked wrong.",24408,2
24409,The fit is awkward.,24409,2
24409,The material is very cheap and uncomfortable.,24409,2
24410,Dope design.,24410,2
24410,I even like the material.,24410,2
24410,It runs super small.,24410,2
24410,"On top of that, I washed it once and it shrank and faded like crazy.",24410,2
24410,The shape in real life is actually a box shape.,24410,2
24410,It's almost a crop top.,24410,2
24411,I have a handful of Carhartt pants in several different styles.,24411,2
24411,I have two pairs in this style.,24411,2
24411,All of them fit consistently.,24411,2
24411,I tried to replace my worn out charcoal loose fit 5 pocket canvas carpenter jeans and received a pair that was far too small through the waist.,24411,2
24411,I returned them and ordered a replacement and got another pair that was far too small.,24411,2
24411,What do I do?,24411,2
24411,Is it just this style that has shifted sizes?,24411,2
24411,is it just this color?,24411,2
24411,This is a huge pain in the butt.,24411,2
24411,I need to replace my favorite worn out pants and this too much work.,24411,2
24412,"Very Cheap, poorly made.",24412,2
24412,will rip if you are not careful.,24412,2
24412,Was really hoping it could fit.,24412,2
24412,"I ordered a Large, should have gotten a bigger size.",24412,2
24413,I really like the shirt.,24413,2
24413,It was just what I wanted.,24413,2
24413,"However, I wore it once, and then the stitching holding the sequins on started coming undone right away.",24413,2
24413,I haven't washed it.,24413,2
24413,"I have done nothing that would cause this kind of wear so quickly, but now I cannot wear it again.",24413,2
24414,"I only give these 2 stars because atleast they look cool, for a second.",24414,2
24414,Wearing them for more than that starts to bother my eyes.,24414,2
24414,It's hard to see out of them and uncomfortable to wear.,24414,2
24414,I always end up with a headache within minutes.,24414,2
24414,I bought these a week ago and will be returning them.,24414,2
24415,I had to return because it was too small even though I bought a size larger.,24415,2
24415,Very disappointed,24415,2
24416,I purchased this for the good deal.,24416,2
24416,But I did not look as closly as I should have.,24416,2
24416,I thought this would have had the adorable tie back with the bow.,24416,2
24416,It does not.,24416,2
24416,"instead it has a stapled floppy upside down one in the center of the shoulders, its not tie back.",24416,2
24416,However I cant be upset because the sellers pictures do not show a back side.,24416,2
24416,Where the others do.,24416,2
24416,I assumed it was the same.,24416,2
24416,That was my fault.,24416,2
24416,However I also must say the ancor ont he front is not as seemless as it looks in the photo.,24416,2
24416,"Edjes are peeled up, and has cresses throught it.",24416,2
24417,Looks cheap but does the job,24417,2
24418,Gave it away,24418,2
24419,WELL...CUTE BUT NO PRIZE...MADE IN CHINA...SLOW DELIVERY....THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE AND COORDINATE WITH SOME STUFF I HAVE...HOWEVER...THEY ARRIVED WITH NO BACKS AND ARE JUST A BIT TOO HEAVY,24419,2
24420,Love the dress but a little bit small,24420,2
24421,It says they are expandable but they are NOT!,24421,2
24421,Otherwise I like color and lightness but worry about a big trip with no extra space.,24421,2
24422,"It dosnt look like a picture first of all and shrieked with the first wash , cheap material",24422,2
24423,Cheap foam not worth the money pieces fell off after second use,24423,2
24424,"The bottom fits loosly, while the top fits small.",24424,2
24424,There is hardly any padding or cushion on the swim top.,24424,2
24424,I was hoping for a better outcome.,24424,2
24425,"The fabric is T shirt thickness, definitely not a sweatshirt at all.",24425,2
24425,"The design is as pictured, but not sharp, images are fuzzy.",24425,2
24425,I ordered the one that looks like a rainbow saturn and has spacemen on it.,24425,2
24425,"It fits, I usually wear a small and it is listed as medium.",24425,2
24425,"But the fabric is not cotton or good sleepwear material, which was what I wanted.",24425,2
24425,Luckily $8 and I will find some use for it.,24425,2
24426,"Does not look like the picture, looks like a different fabric and a completely different cut.",24426,2
24426,Overall it just looks like a completely different dress than the one pictured but I may be able to wear it with a sticky bra as a shirt with a sweater thing over top ......maybe :/  Also it was a bit smaller than what I had hoped for,24426,2
24427,it doesn't like it looks in the pic.,24427,2
24428,I wouldn't say I hate these because I don't hate the waist band which fits well and sits perfectly below the baby bump (exactly what I was looking for).,24428,2
24428,The only PROBLEM is that I HATE the opening for the thighs - they are way too tight and dig into the skin which is super uncomfortable so I can't wear them for long periods of time.,24428,2
24428,"I'm mostly keeping them as ""throw away"" panties at the hospital and after delivery.",24428,2
24428,"*If you have skinny skinny thighs, you might like these panties.",24428,2
24429,Not the most attractive skirt in the world.,24429,2
24429,"The length wasn't good either, too long.",24429,2
24429,Just looked sad.,24429,2
24430,Is a nice bracelet but the watch is poorly made it works but its loose on the inside of the glass.,24430,2
24430,Reccomend on buying just for the looks of it but the watch part its useless de square dial its al crooked and loose.,24430,2
24430,I give this a 2 star just because i like the looks of the bracelet but not the watch part.,24430,2
24431,"This dress is beautiful, but it runs very small.",24431,2
24431,"If you order, get a bigger size.",24431,2
24432,i didn't really like it much .,24432,2
24432,"i bought this dress for work, its to short and tight.",24432,2
24432,i should have went a size bigger .,24432,2
24432,"the way the dress is , is a lot different then what i expected.",24432,2
24432,the little jacket that comes with the dress is sewed in completely.,24432,2
24432,i thought that it would look more like a two piece instead of a one piece,24432,2
24433,These arrived with one side very loose.,24433,2
24434,It's lightweight and really cute.,24434,2
24434,I tried it on and it came up so that the bottom of my stomach showed.,24434,2
24434,It fit nicely at the top but was too short for my comfort.,24434,2
24434,Was very disappointed.,24434,2
24435,Too Tight in the sleeves,24435,2
24436,"Too small, says it's a 6 but it's not even a 4.",24436,2
24436,I have to return it,24436,2
24437,"First let me say, that before ordering I read all the reviews from other buyers, and I ordered it anyway, thinking that maybe they where being to picky, I mean for the price I wasn't expecting it to be Versace, but!!",24437,2
24437,Upon opening the package as soon as i felt the fabric i knew i wouldn't like it.,24437,2
24437,"It is a very thin, cheap fabric, like the edges of the cape part curl up.",24437,2
24437,"like someone else's review said, almost like Halloween costume material.",24437,2
24437,"It doesn't come with the belt, like shown in the picture.",24437,2
24437,"I did try the dress on and it fit perfect, so sizes are accurate.",24437,2
24437,Just poor quality,24437,2
24438,Quality of the material was poor.,24438,2
24439,Order them in black and white stripe and I received them in red and white.,24439,2
24440,"The positive: It came 2 weeks early
The negative: I wear an XL because i like my shirts a little looser.",24440,2
24440,Never had an issue with any shirts when i ordered Online or from a brick in mortar store.,24440,2
24440,Well i got this shirt and it literally runs small.,24440,2
24440,2nd thing the print is faded.,24440,2
24440,Not bold and colorful like it looks in the picture.,24440,2
24440,"Its dull, looks more like an iron on or a sticker rather than a screenprint.",24440,2
24440,Which brings us to the back of the shirt.,24440,2
24440,It was supposed to have the logo in the background and all that's there is a circle.,24440,2
24440,Yes.,24440,2
24440,a circle.,24440,2
24440,Quality control anyone?,24440,2
24440,Not happy with his purchase and not gonna order from this seller again.,24440,2
24441,Cheaply made.,24441,2
24441,Smelled like two week old laundry stuck in the washer.,24441,2
24442,Was not what  I  expecte.d,24442,2
24443,Did not fit our faces,24443,2
24444,For the price is excellent however the thin piece of silk around the edges it's only a quarter of an inch thick.,24444,2
24444,It looks at least three quarters of an inch to 1 inch in the picture.,24444,2
24445,Poor quality,24445,2
24446,It was too small for the large size they had!,24446,2
24446,Beautiful green!,24446,2
24447,Cheaply made but cute .,24447,2
24447,Just make sure to cover in clear nail polish or elae its sure to make ur fingers freen also they are a bit small,24447,2
24448,"I bought a pair of these robes in Large, hoping they would be perfect for my husband and I to walk to our hot tub.",24448,2
24448,"Well, they fit slightly on the small side before washing.",24448,2
24448,"After washing, they were too small.",24448,2
24448,The arm length was way too short also.,24448,2
24448,"I would not consider this a bargain, and if buying robes, I would opt for a higher quality one, even if it means paying a little more.",24448,2
24449,The zipper broke as she tried it on!!,24449,2
24449,Cheaply made.,24449,2
24449,We had to replace the zipper,24449,2
24450,Pretty bracelet impossible to keep clean.,24450,2
24450,Also snags on clothing.,24450,2
24451,One time use only,24451,2
24452,Small!,24452,2
24452,maybe for a child,24452,2
24453,These run a size smaller.,24453,2
24453,Will have to be returning these because they are just to small.,24453,2
24454,It fits great.,24454,2
24454,But the quality is horrible.,24454,2
24454,"Withing 1 week of washing the jacket by hand, the jacket had holes.",24454,2
24454,"Its now 4 months and it's tearing, didn't even last a year before being worthless.",24454,2
24455,The skirt fit great but the arm holes were too small,24455,2
24456,Sheer from the knee down...looks goofy,24456,2
24457,It was just okay.,24457,2
24457,Not great quality and the color was closer to olive than mint.,24457,2
24458,"So for $12, it's not a bad value.",24458,2
24458,This is a cute sheer top made for a tween.,24458,2
24458,I normally wear a medium to large for fitted items.,24458,2
24458,Medium for loose.,24458,2
24458,"This is loose fitting and I got the XL based on their size chart, doesn't come close to fitting plus it took a month to arrive and now I must await a return approval.",24458,2
24458,"This is a great top for young girls, my 14 year old niece would fit this XL perfectly and she's 100 pounds soaked and wet.",24458,2
24458,I'll let you know how the return goers.,24458,2
24458,Not a lot of room to gripe about $11.99 but what a waste of time and carbon foot print.,24458,2
24459,Fit and grabs in the wrong places plus no under skirt,24459,2
24460,they shrunk after the first wash,24460,2
24461,The pink looks yellowish !,24461,2
24461,!,24461,2
24461,!,24461,2
24462,It did fit size wise but one thing I didn't realize was the part the covers the chest is a rectangle and leaves my daughters sides completely uncovered and was not expecting that,24462,2
24463,This dress is not as pictured.,24463,2
24463,"The build in bra is pointy, the bottom of the dress is tulle.",24463,2
24463,I am 5.0 tall and it fitted like a huge curtain.,24463,2
24463,I recommend it for someone who is 5.5 or taller.,24463,2
24463,"The lace on the top was good, just did not fit well for me.",24463,2
24464,Size 32E is too small in the band and cup (about two cup sizes too small).,24464,2
24464,Would order in a larger size if available because I did like the quality and the amount of push-up.,24464,2
24465,Kind of cheap... You get what you pay for,24465,2
24466,Way too small!,24466,2
24467,"Beautiful and high quality materials, as one would expect from a made-in-USA product intended to last a lifetime, BUT with a critical design flaw: the poorly designed clasp requires two hands and some dexterity to do and undo.",24467,2
24467,One simply cannot lock the clasp on the fly with one hand when one is encumbered or driving.,24467,2
24467,I suggest that Saddleback re-design this essential element and offer all purchasers a recall and replacement.,24467,2
24468,Buttons did not match,24468,2
24469,"Not only was this ridiculously small (I ordered a size L and usually fit somewhere between a S/M at 5'5 and 140 lbs), but the proportions were super weird.",24469,2
24469,"The cups sat right above the belly button- you can yank them back up to the chest area, but they just slid back down repeatedly...",24469,2
24470,"I never thought I'd have this problem at 5'1"" wearing size 1, but the legs were too short...  Not the whole leggings, mind you--just the legs.",24470,2
24470,The inseam was weirdly short so the crotch was too low!,24470,2
24470,"Even stretching them as high as they would go, it was still saggy in the crotch.",24470,2
24470,And rode down the whole evening.,24470,2
24470,I felt like a penguin.,24470,2
24470,"They kept me warm, for which I am grateful (and why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1), but I won't be wearing them again.",24470,2
24471,"Belt arrived bent/folded, I guess for shipping.",24471,2
24471,It was very difficult to unbend and shape properly.,24471,2
24471,It still has bends and kinks and i cant get the desired smoothness out of the metal.,24471,2
24471,It was only $6 so I am not too upset.,24471,2
24471,Just wished it wasn't all bent up :(,24471,2
24472,This bad is way too small and it's not real leather.,24472,2
24472,Straight up rip off for $90.,24472,2
24473,"The shirt is well made, really good quality, but terribly small.",24473,2
24473,"I will likely give this to my 12 year old niece to wear, as it will fit her perfect.",24473,2
24474,Love the look but they are the NOSIEST shoes I have ever had.,24474,2
24474,People can hear me coming from a mile a way.,24474,2
24475,It is  really cute and soft.. that is  the plus to it...,24475,2
24475,It is no where near the size it is suppose to be..,24475,2
24475,I was wondering if it is like a 4x in Juniors size.,24475,2
24475,it's sure not for an adult.,24475,2
24475,Too much of a hassle to even try to return it.. it took almost 2 months to get here.,24475,2
24475,Not a happy customer what-so-ever!,24475,2
24476,"Very thin material, makes me afraid to wash.  And sizes are waaayyyy off.",24476,2
24476,A XXL is like a size small in US sizes.,24476,2
24477,Way too small.,24477,2
24477,I own over 30 pieces of lingerie from Amazon and all the descriptions and sizes are on the spot!,24477,2
24477,This is the only piece thats crazy small....,24477,2
24477,I got the medium.,24477,2
24477,Im 5'3 135lbs 34D and i couldn't remotely close it around my body with the laces totally undone.,24477,2
24477,Too bad because i really wanted this in gold!,24477,2
24478,The mesh lining is printed with a camouflage pattern which shows through in blotches and makes the cap look dirty!,24478,2
24479,The chain was already broken when it arrived,24479,2
24480,"Very low quality, the lace rips extremely easily and falls apart in the washing machine.",24480,2
24480,The sizing is way off as well.,24480,2
24481,This is an inexpensive skate costume/dress.,24481,2
24481,"I bought it to wear in ""sessions"" -- it suits the purpose:  allows plenty of room to move and is attractive.",24481,2
24481,"It is not a true ""skate costume"" as it does not include ""bloomers"".",24481,2
24481,In addition to tights you need to wear bike/exercise shorts.,24481,2
24481,The fit is very boxy.... No waist or flair to skirt.,24481,2
24481,No darts to define just or shape.,24481,2
24481,"For the price, it is okay for a dressy appearance while working out in a skating rink, but you still need to CYA if you are doing jumps or arabesques.",24481,2
24482,way too small.,24482,2
24483,Was made more of a spandex material didn't have the flow that the photo showed.,24483,2
24484,It's cute but will be better once I fix the sizing issues.,24484,2
24484,This is also very short for a maximum dress.,24484,2
24484,"I'm 5'10"" and maximum dresses are typically pretty short on my but this dress is at least 4 inches from being floor length.",24484,2
24485,"This a cute well made set, however it is way too small, i ordered the largest size and it sound like a 34B to the US size",24485,2
24486,You'd better be a size 4 to fit in xl!!!,24486,2
24486,"If you have a full bust, don't order!",24486,2
24486,Bottoms way too narrow for a southern woman!,24486,2
24486,!,24486,2
24487,these are NOT a women's large.,24487,2
24488,Smaller than expected.,24488,2
24488,the zipper tag fell apart the moment my daughter unzipped it.,24488,2
24489,Pretty sheer.,24489,2
24489,Order up a size.,24489,2
24490,I consider myself having a normal sized human male head.,24490,2
24490,These glasses are extremely small.,24490,2

24494,"It smells strongly of chemicals, as well.",24494,2
24494,The horse in the center of the embroidery is a cheap rubbery decal.,24494,2

24495,Buyer Beware :/,24495,2
24496,Bought a size up from what everyone said I would need....seriously wasn't even close to fitting me.,24496,2
24497,Way to big for a money clip.,24497,2
24497,I bought a different  one a day after this arrived.,24497,2
24498,It is not what I expected.,24498,2
24498,The packaging was terrible.,24498,2
24498,There is a stain on the coat where the packaging was open.,24498,2
24498,The coat is all wrinkled.,24498,2
24498,I will have to send it to the cleaners before I can wear it.,24498,2
24498,It do not look as pretty as the picture.,24498,2
24499,cheap looking,24499,2
24500,Very long sleeves,24500,2
24501,Love the style and idea.,24501,2
24501,Fabric not very stretchy.,24501,2
24501,Doesn't fit.,24501,2
24501,May fit if I lose two sizes.,24501,2
24502,"Was not as advertised, was supposed to be a winter coat but was more like a spring coat for a midget!",24502,2
24502,We are still happy with Amazons service,24502,2
24503,Ordered a large but it was still too small.,24503,2
24504,Cute but the lining cups came all messed up.,24504,2
24504,Had to add my own.,24504,2
24504,You get what you pay for...,24504,2
24505,"It's a good shirt, but this is not a dress.",24505,2
24505,And it's not hemmed.,24505,2
24506,Shirt does not fit well.,24506,2
24506,Length of arms is too short.,24506,2
24506,Shirt not true to size.,24506,2
24507,It's more like a shirt than a dress.,24507,2
24507,Very short and very thin material.,24507,2
24507,Very cheaply made.,24507,2
24507,"The lining of the dress is also very short and way shorter in the back than the front, you can see my underwear easily.",24507,2
24507,"I had to buy a slip with lace at the bottom and I'm hoping I can layer it and still wear it, if not I'm not sure what to do.",24507,2
24508,Thinner than expected and smaller than expected.,24508,2
24509,I agree wholeheartedly with other reviewers who have said this is not a maternity dress.,24509,2
24509,"It's a cute dress, and I'll wear it after pregnancy, but that's not why I bought it.",24509,2
24509,"I'm a small-framed person, and haven't gained much weight during my pregnancy, so I can only attribute the poor fit to the design of this garment.",24509,2
24509,"If they could tailor it better to the growing belly of a pregnant woman, it'd be a wonderful dress.",24509,2
24510,This was smaller than I anticipated and I did not like the plastic zippers.,24510,2
24510,They did not glide easily and I found they stuck a lot,24510,2
24511,Words fade too fast,24511,2
24512,The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because we haven't had it a month and maybe used it three times and the remote plug in decided to quit working.,24512,2
24512,I can still plug the manual in and go through the colors but it's a hassle since you are zipping through fur.,24512,2
24512,Other than that we loved it.,24512,2
24513,I really loved this ring until it started to tarnish after a couple weeks :(,24513,2
24514,Sleeves were way too skinny,24514,2
24515,Fit much shorter than expected despite ordering two sizes up.,24515,2
24515,Chinese XL fits like U.S. medium.,24515,2
24516,I loved the print and the design but the waist is too high.,24516,2
24516,I agree with a former reviewer who said the dress should be pretty but it isn't.,24516,2
24516,I am sad about needing to send it back.,24516,2
24517,The fit was very small and I had to return the shirt...,24517,2
24517,I wear a large.,24517,2
24517,The large ordered was way too small.,24517,2
24518,"The ears on these are fairly long and actually resemble bunny ears more than zebra, the tail on the other hand was way too short for anyone over 4 ft tall.",24518,2
24518,Both were fairly cheaply made and you really have to reach in order to say they are zebra.,24518,2
24518,I would suggest going to your local zoo for something a little better quality.,24518,2
24519,AWFUL!!!!,24519,2
24519,"Weird fabric, so unflattering!!",24519,2
24519,"I was dissapointed when I tried this on, fabric feels like  thick tissue paper ( if that makes sense).",24519,2
24519,"It doesn't lay right and puffs out in the front and back, plus a medium feels too big.",24519,2
24519,I will be returning.,24519,2
24520,Buyer Beware!,24520,2
24520,I got these glasses thinking the lenses would be a lot shorter.,24520,2
24520,"In reality, the lenses are 1.5"" tall and 1 7/8"" wide.",24520,2
24520,They look like they have a much lower profile in the photo.,24520,2
24520,"In addition, the plastic above the nose bridge and on the crown (on the edges where the arms swing out is a lot bigger (about 1/4 inch taller) than the photo depicts.",24520,2
24520,"Lastly, the brown ones have a ""spotted leopard"" pattern on them that no man should be caught wearing.",24520,2
24520,Too bad they left all of thos out of the product description.,24520,2
24520,I'll be returning mine.,24520,2
24521,I didn't care for the material but a co worker purchased them from me,24521,2
24522,I have had hard time with the belly bandit.,24522,2
24522,The S was kind of small and the M was big (I have both).,24522,2
24523,"It is super comfortable, but it arrived with one of the clips on the strap broken.",24523,2
24523,"I had to macgyver it, but it worked.",24523,2
24524,Sleeves much smaller than rest of sweater,24524,2
24525,Only reason I did a review like this is to again WARN PEOPLE to read the description.,24525,2
24525,"It only is selling one, I of course didn't read completely into it and expected two.",24525,2
24525,"It is cute, but I don't want to walk around with only one in.",24525,2
24525,Could order another but why bother.,24525,2
24526,I wanted these pajamas to be as great as everyone says they are but they're just not.,24526,2
24526,They're heavy and cling when I perspire.,24526,2
24526,They're not uncomfortable but they don't keep me cool.,24526,2
24526,I am so very disappointed.,24526,2
24527,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,24527,2
24527,"Too big , different fit !",24527,2
24528,"Seems like it could be a decent, cheap windbreaker but MY GOD is it tiny.",24528,2
24528,"I'm on the heavier side, usually wear XL shirts.",24528,2
24528,"Read the reviews here and saw that people recommended going 1 size larger, so I went ahead and got the XXL.",24528,2
24528,"If I could zip the thing up, I would have asphyxiated myself.",24528,2
24528,I simply can't wear it and had to return it.,24528,2
24528,"If it would have fit, I would have liked it.",24528,2
24529,"Lovely dress,looks great on my niece,but the bottom layers are so wrinkled,contacted the seller,was told to handwash the dress and it would be fine......well,this is a heavy dress dry, I'm not comfortable doing that as the dress fits perfectly,plus I have severe arthritis in my hands.",24529,2
24529,"Contemplating sending it back,the bottom is obviously sewn with fishing line to give it a ruffled look,found so far 4 places the line is broken and sticks out,it's kinda sharp and would certainly cause hose to run.the wrinkles are the problem,I've misted it with water,doesn't change,was told not to iron the dress so I'm not comfortable steaming it,I fear the heat could damage it,or the color could run,wish my niece wasn't so attached to this dress.",24529,2
24530,"Cute case, but cracked within a week, not very durable.",24530,2
24531,The straps were too big and it fits awkwardly imo,24531,2
24532,"I like everything about this sock, except that it will not stay up--which means I cannot recommend.",24532,2
24533,I love this hoodie but I'm very disappointed.,24533,2
24533,The zipper broke within 3 times of wearing it.,24533,2
24534,Nice set of earrings but definitely NOT meant for tragus.,24534,2
24534,Product should not be coming up under tragus search.,24534,2
24534,The earring is too short to ever get the ball on the back so they will fall out.,24534,2
24534,"Considering I brought these specifically for my tragus, they were a waste.",24534,2
24535,Very pretty and well made but the bars are a little shorter tHan my standard ones making them too short to comfortably wear.,24535,2
24535,My initial thought was just to put the balls on a longer bar but only one ball on each is removable.,24535,2
24535,"So although they are pretty, they are useless to me unfortunately.",24535,2
24536,Very cheap looking.,24536,2
24537,Expected them to be all metal but has some plastic and were bent when they arrived,24537,2
24538,"I was super excited for this dress to come and had plans to wear it with some over the knee boots and a cardigan, super cute!",24538,2
24538,But when it arrived I was highly disappointed.,24538,2
24538,"I'm pretty tall for a girl at 5'9"", but to say this dress was a little too short is an understatement.",24538,2
24538,"Even if I'm standing up straight, the bottom of my butt cheeks hang out!",24538,2
24538,"I think in order for this dress to be an appropriate length, the person wearing it couldn't be much taller than 5 feet at the most.",24538,2
24538,"I rated the dress as fitting ""too small"" which still isn't entirely true because though the length is short, the rest of the dress around fits loosely.",24538,2
24538,The fabric is also very strange... not the soft cottony texture I expected.,24538,2
24538,The best way I can think to describe it is a stretchy leotard fabric a little kid would wear in dance class.,24538,2
24538,The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because it makes a pretty darn comfy night gown.,24538,2
24538,If it wasn't so comfortable it wouldn't be getting any stars.,24538,2
24539,Cheap,24539,2
24540,I bought this by the size chart and it was so large that I had to return it.,24540,2
24541,"Was beautiful, but entirely to small.",24541,2
24541,Ordered a 2XL and it fit more like a standard large.,24541,2
24541,Disappointed.,24541,2
24542,Hard to use and it's too smal .,24542,2
24542,But I like the color.,24542,2
24543,Cute bag but the plastic coating is cracking and breaking off after only a few months of use.,24543,2
24544,"Pretty, but stem oine one stud is loose and wobbly.",24544,2
24544,I will super glue it,24544,2
24545,Received on Wednesday.,24545,2
24545,Zipper broken by Saturday.,24545,2
24545,Definitely blue.,24545,2
24545,Although on 2 different monitors it looked teal.,24545,2
24545,The blue is pretty though.,24545,2
24545,The short straps are too short to use comfortably.,24545,2
24545,Oh well it was only 22$  :/,24545,2
24546,"I ordered this in a large, and it is tiny!",24546,2
24546,There is no way I could fit into this skirt.,24546,2
24546,"Rather than return it, I gave it to a much smaller friend.",24546,2
24547,Was way too small.,24547,2
24547,Sizes are not even close to your regular size.,24547,2
24548,not true to size at all...,24548,2
24549,"My husband didn't like them....we usually buy this brand, but it wasn't quite the same.",24549,2
24550,way small for a large,24550,2
24551,"I thought these would be better than the original ones due to the snaps on the side, however the snaps are very small and somewhat hard to use.",24551,2
24551,"Also, snaps on one side is not enough to to prevent smearing poop down baby's leg when changing.",24551,2
24551,I wish I could return these.,24551,2
24551,I will be ordering ones with snaps/velcro on both sides and will keep these for back up.,24551,2
24551,They are also a little snug.,24551,2
24551,The large is small in the bottom on my son who is about 21 pounds and a size 3 Honest diaper.,24551,2
24552,I wear a large in womens t-shirts this fits like a small,24552,2
24553,"cheap fabric, heavy swimsuit material",24553,2
24554,"very cute shirt, fits as expected.",24554,2
24554,However the description indicates it is a poly/viscose blend fabric (65 poly/35 viscose) but what I received was 100% cotton.,24554,2
24554,I would not have bought it if I knew it was 100% cotton.,24554,2
24555,"I really wanted to enjoy this product, but unfortunately, it isn't functional in the slightest.",24555,2
24555,"The inner rubber grips are unable to hold the garter up on the thigh for longer than 5 minutes even with the pockets empty, no matter how tight I would wear it (FYI my thighs are ~20in/50cm).",24555,2
24555,I was able to fix this by attaching it to a garter belt.,24555,2
24555,"However, I still found it a pain to wear because the velcro that holds it together was very uncomfortable/scratchy and would frequently rip apart.",24555,2
24555,"All in all, even with NOTHING in the pockets AND with a garter belt, I would constantly have to adjust this in order to wear it throughout the day.",24555,2
24555,I still think it's a great concept that just hasn't hit its mark yet.,24555,2
24555,It is a good looking garter and is made with quality materials (felt great with the exception of the velcro).,24555,2
24555,I hope the company making these considers releasing one compatible with garter belts; I think it would resolve a lot of the product's downsides.,24555,2
24555,TL;DR: I do not recommend spending money on this,24555,2
24556,"Wen I  wash it ,shrink up",24556,2
24557,snug for an X-Large,24557,2
24558,Negatives: Horns are made out of thin cheap foam.,24558,2
24558,Unexpectedly hollow.,24558,2
24558,"My package was crushed upon arrival, and the foam material was creased.",24558,2
24558,Looks terrible.,24558,2
24558,Ugly seam running up the side of the horns.,24558,2
24558,"Thought they would be black like in the picture, but they were actually light brown so I had to paint them.",24558,2
24558,Needed right away for an event or I would have returned and ordered a different set.,24558,2
24558,Positives: Took paint well.,24558,2
24558,Adjustable rubber cord held horns on well and disappeared into hair with no problems.,24558,2
24558,Definitely NOT worth the $14 price tag.,24558,2
24558,I would not pay more than $5 for them if I had seen them in person.,24558,2
24559,The sizing is way off.,24559,2
24559,There is no way this is a plus size swim suit.,24559,2
24560,"The item is cute and was inexpensive, so don't expect the best quality in craftsmanship, you get what you pay for.",24560,2
24560,"My 11 year old daughter likes look and style, and has worn it approximately 4+ times, and has washed it.",24560,2
24560,"The pattern has held up, the material is EASILY wrinkled and the button holes are either unfinished or slightly off line from
corresponding buttons.",24560,2
24560,"We are happy enough to keep the shirt, but not happy enough with the quality to buy it again.",24560,2
24561,The Quality seems very poor for a Dooney,24561,2
24562,Shrunk a lot,24562,2
24563,gave them to my daughter,24563,2
24564,"too small,but cost more to exchange",24564,2
24565,runs small,24565,2
24566,The zipper broke when I put it on,24566,2
24567,"The image of the shirt is somewhat deceptive, in that the lettering and logo appears to be separately screen printed onto the shirt.",24567,2
24567,The logo and lettering is however a single iron-on type transfer.,24567,2
24567,The result is that the black in between the logo and the lettering is shiny and differs from the rest of the fabric.,24567,2
24568,"ITS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, I WISH IT WAS LARGER, IS THERE A LARGER ONE AVAILABLE",24568,2
24569,it came in the mail with a broken strap,24569,2
24570,"I love this bag,but the wallet didn't come with.",24570,2
24571,GREAT QUALITY.,24571,2
24571,"However, there is a reason the models in the pictures of all colors hide the waist.",24571,2
24571,Its has a very awkward fit around the waist.,24571,2
24571,Buy only if you plan to wear it with a belt like in the black picture.,24571,2
24571,So sad!,24571,2
24572,Very oversized !,24572,2
24572,Baggy and no pockets !,24572,2
24573,"The material is very cheap, and is not for every day use like I had hoped.",24573,2
24574,Stitching was baf,24574,2
24575,It did not come with any protective covering on the face or most of the band.,24575,2
24575,As a result it arrived scratched on the face and a little bit on the band too and I had to return it.,24575,2
24575,It looked like it worked fine but I expected to get a new watch and I do not think I received that.,24575,2
24576,Fabric was nice but the shirt was not tapered like the one in the picture.,24576,2
24576,It was wide like something for a grandma,24576,2
24577,The dress fit as expected.,24577,2
24577,The sewing however is uneven and bunched in some areas.,24577,2
24577,The fabric layers make up for how thin it is.,24577,2
24577,It's very comfortable to wear.,24577,2
24577,Looks much better after an ironing.,24577,2
24577,The bad part is it's falling apart after 3 washes on gentle cycle with gentle soap and hanging dry.,24577,2
24577,So...,24577,2
24577,I'd say buy it if you don't mind cheap construction and only expect to wear it a few times.,24577,2
24577,Very disappointed...but you get what you pay for I guess.,24577,2
24578,Nice!,24578,2
24578,Unfortunately tarnished quickly,24578,2
24579,Style was okay but have only worn it once and it is coming apart sadly.,24579,2
24580,Looks adorable.,24580,2
24580,Near impossible to get out.,24580,2
24580,Very cheap.,24580,2
24580,Cute for a night.,24580,2
24580,Slight panic when your ready to take it out,24580,2
24581,It is pretty but very small for a 4xl.,24581,2
24581,The bust area inserted pads move around.,24581,2
24581,You get what you pay for.,24581,2
24581,Cheap,24581,2
24582,Pretty thin and squish my nose but ok for one time use.,24582,2
24583,These fit fine but are pretty sheer and see through which isn't great.,24583,2
24583,They also pilled after just a few wears which is really disappointing.,24583,2
24584,Cute look but the twist on part is cheap so it doesn't screw on all that great,24584,2
24585,Wow...the material is NOT the pretty and shiny material that you see pictured!,24585,2
24585,The material closely resembles a black garbage bag.,24585,2
24585,I am not exaggerating.,24585,2
24585,"Oh, and unless you're a bigger girl , this will hang loosely on your body!!!",24585,2
24585,"I'm 5'9"", 130lbs, size 4.",24585,2
24585,I have a big butt and curvy thighs and I thought I would fill out the suit because my body looks almost identical to the model's.,24585,2
24585,NOPE.,24585,2
24585,This is soooo loose.,24585,2
24585,So unflattering.,24585,2
24585,I cant wear this.,24585,2
24586,Too small.,24586,2
24587,Well it looks cute out of the package but haven't even tried it on her.,24587,2
24587,Grossed out by the arm pit stains and the deodorant marks and the smell.,24587,2
24587,Really disappointed in the lack of care when sending me a returned item without cleaning it up at least.,24587,2
24587,I have pics but not sure how I can attach them.,24587,2
24588,Not those which we were expecting also the colors selected and received are different.,24588,2
24589,Was small for my husband,24589,2
24590,Love this but it fell apart in the first week of use.,24590,2
24590,So cute though,24590,2
24591,I returned this.,24591,2
24591,It was way too large and the proportions were way off.,24591,2
24592,The colors are dull unlike the one on the listing.,24592,2
24592,"The sleeves and shirt are LONG (if my husband was into sagging his pants this would be a good shirt but he's not)
All over fit is big... long and loose.",24592,2
24592,Will be returning,24592,2
24593,Not leather as advertised...stitching is coming apart on one glove...price was very cheap though,24593,2
24594,I ordered this dress and tried it on quick and it fit well enough for a $15 dress.,24594,2
24594,"But I bought it for an event that I ended up wearing something else to, so it just hung in the closet.",24594,2
24594,"I recently tried it on again to wear to a party, and realized it was wayyyy to short.",24594,2
24594,"I'm 5""6"" and I ordered a large.",24594,2
24594,This dress fits very strange and the fabric is really cheap.,24594,2
24594,"For $15, not a bad purchase.",24594,2
24594,But I'll probably never wear it.,24594,2
24595,"I purchased two, The colors are very nice and the quality is decenty but the shoulders are cut very 'narrow'  even though the waist  and hips fit fine for a larger sized woman @ Size 2.",24595,2
24596,"Loved the shirt, just didn't fit",24596,2
24597,Very small and difficult to slide over the heal.,24597,2
24597,Lots of weaving strings on the inside for toes to get caught on.,24597,2
24597,Thick too.,24597,2
24598,Way too small,24598,2
24599,Not a one size fits all situation.,24599,2
24600,"Quality seems ok and they ""fit"" my ears BUT the are not snug and the wind leaks in around the edges.",24600,2
24600,Have removed and put them back on my ears a dozen times and they still leak.,24600,2
24600,Going back,24600,2
24601,"Cheap, lackluster not good quality and waaaay too small.",24601,2
24601,"I was blinded by the cheap price, they got me again!",24601,2
24601,Don't buy this unless you are 10 years old.,24601,2
24601,Fraying on the edges.,24601,2
24601,"Blah it's just crappy, I wanted what the chick in the picture was wearing!",24601,2
24602,"High waist, bunches up where the thigh meets the pubic area.",24602,2
24602,Not enough of a pouch for my genitals.,24602,2
24603,I wanted to love this product but the right shoe won't turn off at all until the battery dies.,24603,2
24603,It will only stay red and does not change to any other colors  The left shoe does everything it's suppose to and it's really cool.,24603,2
24603,I'm really disappointed in these.,24603,2
24603,Ive seen other kids wear them and they always look really fun,24603,2
24604,"I picked the size according to the shirt sizes my husband has in the closet, as I was buying it for a Christmas gift, but it was just way too large on him.",24604,2
24605,Lots of choices of colors but they haven't lasted more than a day or 2 each.,24605,2
24605,So quality wise they are basically garbage if they are constantly falling apart.,24605,2
24606,"Gets loose and looses fit
It is a material issue not a size issue
Disappointing",24606,2
24607,This is not a summer dress!,24607,2
24607,It is more like a very see through slip.,24607,2
24607,It is also very small.,24607,2
24607,I ordered a size up and a 3x fits like a medium/large.,24607,2
24607,"( not even joking, my neighbor wears a medium and it fits her just right).",24607,2
24607,"It is also badly sewn in a few spots, which I could handle if it wasn't sheer and too small.",24607,2
24607,If it fit I could've worn it inside.,24607,2
24607,It is so disappointing!!,24607,2
24607,!,24607,2
24608,We ordered a size XL for my mom because it ran small; she's a M/L pending the fit.,24608,2
24608,The tag said 3X when we got it and it was still too small;maybe they put the wrong tag on it.,24608,2
24608,It also had an awful smell and needed to be washed twice.,24608,2
24608,"So my mom gave it to me because it fits more like a medium and since I'm a small, I just put a thin belt on it and it looks nice but slightly larger on the arms.",24608,2
24608,The material doesn't give at all.,24608,2
24608,So it is pretty but not the best material and the company does not know what they're doing hence my rating.,24608,2
24609,Product is bulkier than i expected and definitely not the color it shows in the picture.,24609,2
24610,Dress was not as long as I expected and it had no shape to it at all.,24610,2
24611,It was very tight but cute,24611,2
24612,Cheap material the bra pads were all wrinkled,24612,2
24613,Very Pretty,24613,2
24614,I am rating this dress with 2 stars.,24614,2
24614,You get what you pay for.,24614,2
24614,"I did not expect the dress to be really nice since it was fairly cheap, but it does look night.",24614,2
24614,"The downside, the shoulders are about 6 inches to wide for me.",24614,2
24614,I am 5' 105lbs and ordered a small.,24614,2
24614,There was no xs option.,24614,2
24614,I really wish this dress would fit in the shoulders because the length fit really well.,24614,2
24615,Itchy and too small,24615,2
24616,"I still have it.. but the material is always thinner than you expect, so be careful when buying on amazon,",24616,2
24617,Absolutely see through!,24617,2
24617,"Even with nude colored boy shorts, there is NO way to wear this seamlessly.",24617,2
24617,This product should have been made with a liner.,24617,2
24618,The bottoms fits too big but the top is way too small ...,24618,2
24618,But it a cute bathing suit in the photo,24618,2
24619,I was really hoping to love this dress but unfortunately I do not.,24619,2
24619,"AWFUL material, looks more like a Halloween costume.",24619,2
24619,The fit is also awful.,24619,2
24620,"I returned these because after some research on snug fit vs. looser PJs, I decided to not use PJs that have flame retardant chemicals on them anymore.",24620,2
24620,"It is not just the case for these specific PJs, it seems by law all wider-cut PJs have to be flame retardant.",24620,2
24620,"If this weren't an issue for me, these are cute, soft and snuggly, and their wider/looser style would have worked fit-wise for my 10-month-old, who we have trouble squeezing into snug fit PJs.",24620,2
24620,"I have since given up finding one-piece PJs that do not have flame retardants and are wider cut (snug fit or flame retardant seems to be the law) and have bought some 2 piece cotton PJs  they are also snug fit, but I found that being able to pull the long sleeve shirt over the head makes it a bit easier to pull the arms through than putting on the one-piece.",24620,2
24620,"I like the one-pieces because they don't expose the belly and come with ""feet"" to keep baby toes warm, but the fit and chemical issues made it impossible for us to find an one-piece PJ that works for our baby.",24620,2
24620,"I would say these PJs run small, because my 10-month-old would have fit in these 18 month size with a small bit of room to grow  however, that seems to be the case for my baby with most other clothes brands as well, so I would say that these also fit like other brands of that size (Carters, Target, Gymboree  most all styles run small on my baby, who is slightly above average height and average weight).",24620,2
24621,Its Run too small,24621,2
24622,"So I was going to give this beautiful rose gold belly ring a 5, until it started turning parts of my belly button green and gave me an infection :(",24622,2
24623,This shirt is cute but it runs so small.,24623,2
24623,I ordered up another size and it still to is too small.,24623,2
24623,It just has no give to it.,24623,2
24623,I have to shop on line due to being in a cast on my driving foot so returning it is not an option unfortunately,24623,2
24624,"Bought these expecting to have a looser fit around the mid section, as it looked on the model, but these are tight around the waist.",24624,2
24624,"I normally wear a size M and reading the reviews, went up to a L. It was still too small.",24624,2
24625,"Looks good but not  e true 2x, this runs small, it's  an XL at best.",24625,2
24626,Just not satisfied with how it fits.,24626,2
24627,"Very, very long",24627,2
24628,Fit was great but material was somewhat heavy for summer and the lining of the back pocket made the shirt heavy.,24628,2
24629,"Can't begin to zip it, it's so small",24629,2
24630,I wear a men's size 10.5 or 11 shoe based on the brand.,24630,2
24630,"These socks arrived timely, but I cannot get them past the heal of my foot without strings popping and breaking.",24630,2
24630,"Like some of the other comments, they are more like women's socks (and small at that) and I would agree that they are on the thin side of things.",24630,2
24630,This is not good if you are seeking some type of absorbent quality from the socks.,24630,2
24630,Not for the large footed.,24630,2
24631,Super awkward cut.,24631,2
24631,Not flattering at all.,24631,2
24632,If you get a large get an xl it was to toght on the boobs,24632,2
24633,These are not great for the gym because any amount of sweat is really obvious because of the color,24633,2
24634,This should not be called a dress and it DEFINITELY shouldn't be called a maternity dress.,24634,2
24634,"I'm 5 foot 5, 6 months pregnant and this ""dress"" doesn't even begin to cover anything.",24634,2
24634,The bottom stopped at the top of my pants.,24634,2
24634,I kept it because I'll wear it as a shirt.,24634,2
24635,where stiff and not spongy and comfortable like most wedge flip flops.,24635,2
24635,Too bad because they are cute,24635,2
24636,"These socks were too tight, especially at the top, almost to the point of them being uncomfortable.",24636,2
24636,"My thighs measure 20 inches around and they hit me at about mid-thigh and since they were so tight I got a ""muffin top"" type of effect, not very attractive looking.",24636,2
24636,Another issue is that they would roll down the more I moved.,24636,2
24636,"Cute, but too small.",24636,2
24637,Too small need to return,24637,2
24638,"Beware, dress is see through!",24638,2
24639,"Very large, boxy",24639,2
24640,Too small for the rated size.,24640,2
24640,I purchased the same type pants from Walmartband they fit perfectly.,24640,2
24641,I have this in other color patterns and this was not my favorite material for this shirt too thick and didn't hang well.,24641,2
24642,Cute but runs very small.,24642,2
24643,They are to big.,24643,2
24644,"My son loves this vest, but it's coming apart along the seam where the zipper is.",24644,2
24644,He's very disappointed since he only wore it once.,24644,2
24645,I ordered an XL and it fits like a medium.,24645,2
24645,"I'm guessing it's Junior-sized, since a L should've fit me.",24645,2
24645,"The colors are also far more bold, heavy on the red, than shown.",24645,2
24645,The fabric is *very* thin.,24645,2
24646,"Good quality, looks nice.",24646,2
24646,NO way is this a 3XL.,24646,2
24646,It's barely a 1XL.,24646,2
24647,By the front of the waist and the back it's just too loose...,24647,2
24648,The mesh did not feel comfortable.,24648,2
24649,I intend in  returning this item,24649,2
24650,It is a little tight ~ the problem was when I washed it there are metal rivets and they rusted into the fabric- the graciously refunded my payment,24650,2
24651,Way way shorter than on the model and just fits weird.,24651,2
24651,Way more square and unflattering.,24651,2
24651,I gave it away.,24651,2
24651,"Im 5'7"" and 145lbs",24651,2
24652,"These are very comfortable for being lazy around the house, however, if you love working out at the gym and squatting heavy, nooooot so much!",24652,2
24652,They slide down on your backside and reveal your goodies!,24652,2
24652,Do NOT recommend for wearing at the gym.,24652,2
24653,The brim is NOT large at all.,24653,2
24653,Does not cover the face.,24653,2
24653,Disappointed.,24653,2
24654,Doesn't stay up .. to flimsy of material.... had while in it.,24654,2
24655,Cute top but runs way too small.,24655,2
24655,I normally wear an XL and I ordered an XXL after reading the other posted comments and it still didn't come close to fitting.,24655,2
24655,Sending it back for a refund.,24655,2
24656,"To small, fit my younger sister who's an extra small and I'm usually a medium.",24656,2
24656,I'd order a size two up.,24656,2
24656,But also isn't the same thing in the picture.,24656,2
24656,Cute though and very soft.,24656,2
24657,The top is really cute but it's made with very thin material.,24657,2
24657,"The shorts don't match the top, so they can't be worn together.",24657,2
24657,The top is gray with a blue star and the bottoms are black with a white star,24657,2
24658,The skirt looked as though the length had been cut but no hem was sewn.,24658,2
24658,"Maybe it's supposed to be like that or it was a defect in the skirt I happen to receive, IDK.",24658,2
24658,"That, and the super thin material  (in the white) made it unwearable for me.",24658,2
24658,So I had to send it back.,24658,2
24658,"That said, it was a smooth, easy return with no hassles.",24658,2
24659,Super small.,24659,2
24659,I got a large and it was too tight.,24659,2
24659,I normally wear a small.,24659,2
24659,The large is more like a small.,24659,2
24659,"Too bad b/c it's a nice color, perfect v neck.",24659,2
24659,Good material.,24659,2
24659,Just too small and tight around arms.,24659,2
24659,Was looking to wear it over leggings for yoga but to tight.,24659,2
24660,I only gave two stars because it didn't fit the way a lot of the reviews said it would.,24660,2
24660,It's beautiful though and I truly wish everything worked out fitting wise.,24660,2
24660,Maybe I'll will reorder two sizes up and see if that's better.,24660,2
24661,Way too big,24661,2
24662,"The color of the green necklace is nowhere near the same in person, more like a bright blue green.",24662,2
24663,I COULD NOT WEAR IT IT WAS NOT SIZED CORRECTLYNICE LOOKING PRODUCT GAVE AWAY,24663,2
24664,Fell apart within the week.,24664,2
24665,Zipper was cheap and would not close on this dress - returned.,24665,2
24666,"The bottle is pretty, but the chain is broken so I have to go buy a chain for it.",24666,2
24667,I had this for under a year and it snapped in two.,24667,2
24667,It is clearly not leather.,24667,2
24667,It may have leather on it somewhere but it's not one solid piece of leather.,24667,2
24668,The sizing is very inconsistent.,24668,2
24668,I ordered x-lg and each shirt fit differently.,24668,2
24668,They were all marked x-lg but I would say one fit like x-lg!,24668,2
24669,I love the look of these shoes!,24669,2
24669,Only thing is I purchased a size 1 but received a size 12.5.,24669,2
24669,I purchased as a gift and going they will still fit.,24669,2
24670,It's a very cute costume but does run small in size.,24670,2
24670,"I returned it due to that fact, but it was still great quality and very cute.",24670,2
24670,"Next year, I'll just have to order the right size.",24670,2
24671,I have this item a 2 star rating because this cardigan is child size.,24671,2
24671,I ordered the XL as I usually wear large.,24671,2
24671,I would say the size of this is a small.,24671,2
24671,Horrible!!!,24671,2
24671,It is pretty to look at but that's it.,24671,2
24671,It isn't worth the money to send it back.,24671,2
24671,What a waste.,24671,2
24672,I normally fit in a small top but with button ups I order bigger because of my shoulders.,24672,2
24672,I got a large in this and I still couldn't lift my arms becuase it was too tight on the shoulders.,24672,2
24673,More like a small than a medium,24673,2
24674,They are super large.,24674,2
24674,and fit really weird.,24674,2
24674,I have contact the seller to see if they are selling factory seconds.,24674,2
24674,and to make return arrangements.,24674,2
24674,they are not understanding my request.,24674,2
24674,Very hard to deal with this seller.,24674,2
24674,sad they looked really cool!,24674,2
24675,"Comfortable, but I would call these ""almost no show socks"" instead of ""no show socks "" as you can clearly see the very top of the sock when wearing shoes.",24675,2
24676,This can not be worn by itself (unless your in to very see through) as it is thinner than paper.,24676,2
24677,Too small,24677,2
24678,Shod be considered a jr.,24678,2
24678,Size,24678,2
24679,Better quality than I expected.,24679,2
24679,It is really cute but wayyyyy too small.,24679,2
24679,If you have any hips at all I wouldn't order this.,24679,2
24680,It sort of looks a bit cheap with the clover medallions.,24680,2
24680,WIsh I liked it a bit more.,24680,2
24681,Nice but a little frail looking.,24681,2
24682,The dress looks like it was made out of paper.,24682,2
24682,It looks nothing like the picture.,24682,2
24683,bottoms way to small,24683,2
24684,Made of a foamy type material not cloth really disappointed but its cute i guess,24684,2
24685,"I really liked this wallet, but the zipper broke as soon as I started using it.",24685,2
24686,Flimsy.,24686,2
24686,But bright enough for me to locate quickly,24686,2
24687,Pretty but awful proportion,24687,2
24688,Size lg.,24688,2
24688,fits like a child's large.,24688,2
24688,Made very small.,24688,2
24689,"I saw the other reviews, but had hopes that they fixed their size issue.",24689,2
24689,They didn't.,24689,2
24689,I ordered an 8 and received a 14.,24689,2
24689,Possibly would have been cute if I wasn't swimming in it.,24689,2
24689,"Not a huge fan of the material; stretchy, thin, spandex-like.",24689,2
24689,Returned.,24689,2
24690,Piece of s***!,24690,2
24690,!,24690,2
24691,"Cute, but had in splattered on it, looked honestly like I bought a used faded product.",24691,2
24691,Super cute product.,24691,2
24691,Just sadly it worn be worn because of that.,24691,2
24692,"These shorts are cute, but they are entirely too small.",24692,2
24692,Nothing close to the measuring chart provided.,24692,2
24692,I bought a size bigger than I normally would and I couldn't even get these on.,24692,2
24693,LOVED the pants.,24693,2
24693,"Lightweight, comfy and cute.",24693,2
24693,Fit well.,24693,2
24693,"Then 4 hours into wearing it the 1st time, I was getting into my car and the pants ripped.",24693,2
24693,Not at the seams but in the fabric itself.,24693,2
24693,Can't be repaired.,24693,2
24693,I'm guessing the fabric was of poor quality or something.,24693,2
24693,But I'm not a happy camper.,24693,2
24694,Too thick and too bright!,24694,2
24694,Sent these back 3 days ago!,24694,2
24695,Don't like them the inserts are too loose and fall out,24695,2
24696,Terribly design.,24696,2
24696,Very unflattering.,24696,2
24696,Highly disappointed.,24696,2
24696,Only perk is that it was true to the wine color pictured.,24696,2
24697,"Super lightweight, they won't hold jewelry stable so I had to mount to a base to keep from falling.",24697,2
24698,Poor quality looks pretty but thats about it,24698,2
24699,I ordered XL.,24699,2
24699,I'm a size 10 & short waisted and this was almost too tight.,24699,2
24699,"Nice soft, stretchy material which I liked, however, it was poorly made.",24699,2
24699,I attached picture to see how material is not even close to lining up at the seams.,24699,2
24699,Would not recommend if you have long torso.,24699,2
24700,Super small.,24700,2
24700,Barely fit over my nose and looks stupid.,24700,2
24700,Wouldn't recommend for anyone with a normal sized nose.,24700,2
24701,Larger around the waist than expected for my skinny girl,24701,2
24702,They do not look like the picture that represents the product.,24702,2
24702,I was hoping for more of lady corn but it was more of the other characters also colors were more muted.,24702,2
24703,It runs really small.,24703,2
24703,Absolutely no forgiveness in the material so any little bump or roll will show.,24703,2
24703,Cute idea but not produced well.,24703,2
24704,"Love the dress but it runs large, buyer beware of size as they order.",24704,2
24704,Allow for more in hips and bust than normal.,24704,2
24705,I don't like to post negative reviews but I feel like in doing so I may help others so here goes.,24705,2
24705,I am two weeks post partum and was looking for a dress to wear to a family event that would be forgiving to a new mom.,24705,2
24705,"Normally wear a size M but right now am probably more of a L. With the style of dress I figured a large would suffice, should have read more reviews.",24705,2
24705,If I reordered would probably go 2 sizes up and get an XXL.,24705,2
24705,On opening the package I was surprised at how sheer it is.,24705,2
24705,I got the red and there is no way I could have worn it without a visible slip underneath.,24705,2
24705,Pretty pattern but with sizing and quality it just won't work for me.,24705,2
24705,Getting returned.,24705,2
24706,Short in the arms and has a snug fit,24706,2
24707,Not what i thought,24707,2
24708,The bikini came very wrinkled and the only reason I chose to return it was because it doesn't look like the shade in the picture.,24708,2
24708,The yellow was too neon for my preference.,24708,2
24708,On the other hand it's a good dupe and the fit was as expected I got an xs.,24708,2
24708,I'm 5'2 weigh 106 and 34a.,24708,2
24709,not very sturdy but they look cute!,24709,2
24710,Another fun product but again too small even large if you're over a 34 waist.,24710,2
24711,It's large enough to fit most of my school items but the inner lining is cheaply made and tore within a week.,24711,2
24711,After two weeks the strap busted and the bag fell to the ground while I was walking to class.,24711,2
24711,Now the lining has a large gap and my belongings fall through and get trapped between the outer material and the inner lining.,24711,2
24711,I'm now looking for a new bag that will hold up longer than a month or two..,24711,2
24712,Very good like it,24712,2
24713,Tight in the shoulders.,24713,2
24713,Material looks more glossy in the photo but it was just plain old cotton.,24713,2
24714,"It's beautiful, and I want to keep it but it doesn't have the bonus compartment stated in the description.",24714,2
24714,I will probably need to return it.,24714,2
24714,Disappointed that description is not accurate.,24714,2
24715,"Very well made and looked exactly as pictured, BUT was waaaay smaller than it should have been.",24715,2
24715,I even thought I had been sent the wrong size.,24715,2
24715,"No, I wasn't.",24715,2
24715,Beware before you purchase.,24715,2
24716,quality feels fine and the top like another poster said is thick and not so see through.,24716,2
24716,The only serious problem I have with this dress is that I am average height 5ft 7 almost and this super short.,24716,2
24716,it falls right under the crease of my ass.,24716,2
24716,I cant wear this out as a dress.. there is no bending over in this.,24716,2
24716,So if your super short / petite this is for you.,24716,2
24717,Cheaply made.,24717,2
24717,Cheap material.,24717,2
24717,"It's cute in the picture, but doesn't convey.",24717,2
24718,Size guideline is not accurate.,24718,2
24719,These socks run extremely small.,24719,2
24719,I wear size 11 shoes and have a hard time getting them on.,24719,2
24720,Love the purse but the metal name plate catches on a lot of my clothes and is frustrating.,24720,2
24720,"The color is true to pic, size is awesome but the internal zippers also come apart and have issues.",24720,2
24720,Frustrating to pay $40 for a purse with issues like this.,24720,2
24720,"Do love the ""fit"" tho so I will use it til it is wore out probably...or the zippers give way completely.",24720,2
24720,I'm sure the name plate will come off....,24720,2
24721,Ordered according to chart .. and it's way too small,24721,2
24722,runs small,24722,2
24723,Just doesn't look that great.,24723,2
24724,Crappy seams... Rips easy,24724,2
24725,Loop's were coming off the back of the dress,24725,2
24726,The costume itself was made very well.,24726,2
24726,"However, if you're anything like me and sweat all the time and get hot easy, then this cosplay will suck for you.",24726,2
24726,The shirt and pants both are thick almost like velour type of feel.,24726,2
24726,No breathing at all.,24726,2
24726,"Hot, hot, and more hot.",24726,2
24726,Also the headband that comes with this makes it really hard to pull off the Angled headband covering the sharengun eye like Kakashi does.,24726,2
24726,The headbands metal plate is kind of small too.,24726,2
24726,"I ended up using a dark blue long sleeve t shirt and cut the pants to short like length, then used hemming tape .",24726,2
24726,"Once your legs are wrapped with the gauze,  you can't tell they're shorts anyways.",24726,2
24726,Also the vest that comes with this set is kind of floppy.,24726,2
24726,The collar is not nice and thick padded like other vests I've seen for sale.,24726,2
24726,"This cosplay was kind of high, looking back I wish I would've only bought the vest and shoes.",24726,2
24726,The rest I could've gotten on my own and been more comfortable.,24726,2
24726,"All in all when I had it all on with the wig it looked good, but could've looked better at half the cost",24726,2
24727,I ordered a youth medium (size 10-12) but what arrived was an adult medium size.,24727,2
24727,My 8 year old would have been swimming in it so sadly I need to return it.,24727,2
24728,I bought a 2x and I wear a 12.,24728,2
24728,My daughter is a 7/8.,24728,2
24728,It fit her tight,24728,2
24729,These are advertised as being able to keep you dry.,24729,2
24729,"They do not, at all.",24729,2
24729,Any large raindrop goes right through the pants.,24729,2
24729,"I have ordered waterproofing spray to try and salvage these pants, if that doesn't work then this was a waste of 40$.",24729,2
24729,"If you are looking for something waterproof, these are NOT the pants.",24729,2
24729,They do fit as expected though and are comfortable.,24729,2
24730,Not slouchy...too small and flat.,24730,2
24730,Looks nothing like the picture.,24730,2
24731,Jewels are crooked,24731,2
24732,was too big and had to return.,24732,2
24733,At the time I purchased this shirt I bought four others.,24733,2
24733,They were all in the same size range 2x-3x.,24733,2
24733,This shirt fits like a pup-tent.,24733,2
24733,"Honestly, it looks like a dress.",24733,2
24733,I was so disappointed because I really liked the graphic nature of the design.,24733,2
24733,"Earlier in the day I bought a bathing suit, and totally forgot to buy a cover-up.",24733,2
24733,"So, there is a silver lining to the story since I now get to wear this as a mu mu.",24733,2
24733,"If anyone is thinking about buying this, go at least one to two sizes under your normal.",24733,2
24734,This shirt looks cheap up close.,24734,2
24735,WAYYY too small.....darnit.,24735,2
24736,I buy exclusively Timberland and Skechers shoes for my Granddaughter because they are quality shoes and these appear to be no exception.,24736,2
24736,The colors are bright as shown in the pictures and they are easy on and easy off.,24736,2
24736,UPDATE: My granddaughter just informed me that the top strap..the velcro one.. ripped off of one of the shoes while she was closing it.,24736,2
24736,NOT HAPPY.,24736,2
24736,Hope the shoe store can fix it.,24736,2
24737,Didn't fit like we thought and sleeves too tight.,24737,2
24737,Make sure if you get this you really get right size.,24737,2
24737,Fits a bit small so order up a size.,24737,2
24737,Return is impossible due to overseas so make sure you want because you are stuck with it.,24737,2
24737,They did offer 50% credit and kept it due to returning would cost too much.,24737,2
24737,"Very sheer, so more made as a compliment very up for the beach.",24737,2
24738,Too small,24738,2
24739,it looks very cheep than the picture and it was somewhat small .,24739,2
24739,also the material is not as expected .,24739,2
24740,I think the shirt has possibilities but I really need to reposition the I'm strapping pieces on the arms because for me they are way too big .,24740,2
24741,Runs small.,24741,2
24741,"First time I put it on and pulled the cords to adjust it, one of them popped out of the stitching.",24741,2
24742,Cheap.,24742,2
24742,even for the price.,24742,2
24742,You can see right through it.,24742,2
24743,"The design of this bikini is so cute, but the fabric is so cheap!",24743,2
24743,"(Although, what can you expect for the price?)",24743,2
24743,"It is not your normal stretchy swimsuit fabric, but more of a thin T-shirt like fabric.",24743,2
24743,"It does have a bit of stretch to it, and although the fabric is pretty thin, it's not see-through.",24743,2
24743,"However, there is no padding in the top so if it's nippy outside, you'll be able to tell.",24743,2
24743,"I am 5'6"", 110lbs, 34A and normally wear a size small, but I ordered a medium just to be safe.",24743,2
24743,"However, the bottoms are a tad loose on me and the top fits like a small (the top is pretty revealing).",24743,2
24743,"I would say that the suit fits true to size, but the top is sort of an awkward style.",24743,2
24744,"cheaply made, the star is not white, but sort of reddish.",24744,2
24744,the sizing is ok though.,24744,2
24745,its for kids way to small,24745,2
24746,The cloth material is very thin and transparent.,24746,2
24747,Had to do repairs on this several times just to get through until after Halloween.,24747,2
24747,It's small.,24747,2
24747,It's not well made.,24747,2
24747,It's over priced.,24747,2
24747,The only thing going for it is that it's cute.,24747,2
24747,"One of my friend's comments was ""you could have found a better one at Walmart much cheaper"".",24747,2
24747,So there you go.,24747,2
24747,Sorry to write a negative review but I think it's important to keep it real.,24747,2
24748,these would be great for someone with extremely skinny legs.,24748,2
24748,didn't even go up over my knee,24748,2
24749,It's size for small person.,24749,2
24749,Not what I expected.,24749,2
24750,Plastic...more gold in color than anything.,24750,2
24751,Most of the ones I ordered are screwed on so tight that you can't wear them!!,24751,2
24751,The ones that do open however get the job done,24751,2
24752,"I opened up the package and the shirt smelled like diesel so bad, I hand washed it several times to get the smell out, it's an adorable shirt but it fits really small in the shoulders,arms and chest area, it's also not very long, you couldn't wear it with leggings.",24752,2
24752,"It is a cute shirt tho, unfortunately I'll be sending it back smelling much cleaner.",24752,2
24753,Too small.,24753,2
24753,Had to throw them away.,24753,2
24754,"They print was really nice and they are super soft, just wish that they came up higher in the back!",24754,2
24755,"It's cute, but I will probably use it for a couple of trips and get a better carry-on.",24755,2
24755,I couldn't see how the main case would be expandable.,24755,2
24755,There are no interior pockets at all for organizing stuff.,24755,2
24755,And the expandable top and side handles are not very sturdy.,24755,2
24755,"However, the spinner wheels and pull-out handle work fine.",24755,2
24755,So at least it will be good for getting through airports.,24755,2
24755,"And with the bright color, it would make a good carry-on for a child, plus it's very identifiable for a baggage claim area.",24755,2
24756,The material was comfortable to wear however the design of the dress was not right.,24756,2
24756,The pleats in the front were crooked and the shape of the dress did not hug the body like in the photo(just hung straight down) and the seam along the chest was not finished.,24756,2
24756,I needed to keep tucking in the fabric.,24756,2
24757,Bought an XL.,24757,2
24757,my husband is 6ft 2in and it ran small for him.,24757,2
24757,I did like the fabric.,24757,2
24758,Had to cut the lining out,24758,2
24759,too small did not fit as expected.,24759,2
24759,"I am 5 feet tall, its made for an a tall thin person",24759,2
24760,The ball on this is bigger than I would like it to be.,24760,2
24760,I was expecting something a lot smaller.,24760,2
24760,It's simply not flattering to me.,24760,2
24760,"May work on someone with a bigger nose, I feel mine is average size.",24760,2
24760,"The quality seems good, it's just the size that I hated.",24760,2
24760,The seller was very cooperative and communication was fast and clear.,24760,2
24760,Seller was understanding and allowed me to return for a full refund.,24760,2
24761,The padding is bunched up.,24761,2
24762,"It fits fine but rides up, so I don't wear it.",24762,2
24763,Wrong size delivered.,24763,2
24763,Material was not what I expected.,24763,2
24763,Eventually we agreed on a partial refund if I kept the wrong size product and ordered the correct one next time.,24763,2
24763,To return the item (which they wouldn't cover) would have been close to 50 bucks.,24763,2
24763,I now have a medium sweater I can't wear if anyone is interested.,24763,2
24764,Very cute and soft but sizing is inaccurate,24764,2
24765,It was a $3...,24765,2
24765,So I was not surprised when I got it that it looked like someone had stuffed mold into the bulb instead of pretty little white dandelion seeds.,24765,2
24765,"If I can figure out how to unglue the bulb though, it won't be a total waste because the necklace part is spot on.",24765,2
24765,"If I can unglue it, I could reuse it.",24765,2
24766,Will wear this to work in the yard or weekend lounge wear.,24766,2
24767,Measurements were not accurate,24767,2
24768,"Ordered and XL, I am usually a medium.",24768,2
24768,It didn't even go up my hips.,24768,2
24769,Not happy with my purchase at all.,24769,2
24769,"It's the wrong size, I ordered a size 10 and it's more like a 9.",24769,2
24769,And it feels like plastic.,24769,2
24769,Would not buy again.,24769,2
24770,It's good as far as the look and product quality bit the sizes run small so it's way too small.,24770,2
24771,"Do not recommend  ,super cheep and small ...",24771,2
24772,It's super cheap material,24772,2
24773,"The smell of this wallet was really bad when I first got it, but after a week it got better.",24773,2
24773,I've never known of leather to smell like this.,24773,2
24773,"It's a very strong, sour chemical odor.",24773,2
24773,Maybe the leather is of low grade.,24773,2
24773,It sure looks and feels low grade.,24773,2
24773,"Because of this, the wallet doesn't seem to be of high quality like many reviewers are saying.",24773,2
24773,It's made with a cheap plastic zipper and very small zipper pull.,24773,2
24773,"Although it didn't cost a lot, I still feel like I paid too much for it.",24773,2
24773,This is more like a $15.00 wallet if you ask me.,24773,2
24773,"I will keep it though, because the design of the wallet fits my needs exactly.",24773,2
24773,I'll see how well it holds up.,24773,2
24774,The sizing is not accurate.,24774,2
24775,Material is flimsy and sizing is way off.,24775,2
24776,Broke very quickly.,24776,2
24776,"Cute but super cheap, which shoutbe expected considering the price.",24776,2
24777,Not good.,24777,2
24777,Thr part where it is is Supposed to connect too.,24777,2
24777,The clasp part.,24777,2
24777,It was broken after I have gotten it out of the mail.,24777,2
24777,Y'all need to make sure it is in good quality before shipping it our way.,24777,2
24777,Thanks.,24777,2
24777,Still gorgeous cans buying another one.,24777,2
24777,Probably gonna take a hot glue gun to it the one now i have and just fix it.,24777,2
24778,Fits way too small.,24778,2
24779,Unfortunately this umbrella arrived with three small holes in the plastic.,24779,2
24779,"I liked the size (for my 5 year old), but decided to get a refund in stead of a replacement, fearing any others would rip easily.",24779,2
24779,The plastic was not as strong as I had hoped it would be.,24779,2
24780,Fit nice and look good but the zipper broke after a couple of uses (and on two others).,24780,2
24780,I can't recommend,24780,2
24781,"No change  ,it is ok.  Fay",24781,2
24782,"Really pretty, but the clasp broke in a matter of weeks.",24782,2
24782,I wouldn't buy it again.,24782,2
24783,This is a nice looking wristlet however the strap broke in a short amount of time.,24783,2
24783,"Also, not much room for a phone in a case.",24783,2
24783,I'm currently shopping for a more durable and functional smartphone wallet.,24783,2
24784,Returned.,24784,2
24784,"Size off, very small through body/torso.",24784,2
24784,"Nice fabric and seems well made, just way too small.",24784,2
24785,Too small.,24785,2
24785,iPhone 6+ does not fit,24785,2
24786,Too small,24786,2
24787,It looks so much better in the picture.,24787,2
24787,Its flimsy and thin.,24787,2
24787,I love the idea but this piece is poorly made.,24787,2
24788,I was disappointed when this arrived in brass and the picture shows a silver one.,24788,2
24788,Otherwise it's cute.,24788,2
24789,The lights lasted about 10 minutes.,24789,2
24789,Then nothing.,24789,2
24789,New batteries didn't help.,24789,2
24789,What a disappointment!,24789,2
24790,I ordered a size medium because it said it was true to size.,24790,2
24790,"I'm 130 lbs and 5""5.",24790,2
24790,"When I tried it on, it was way small.",24790,2
24790,Had to return it.,24790,2
24790,I do have to say that it was well made.,24790,2
24790,Very nice strong material.,24790,2
24791,cheap material,24791,2
24792,"If you are a tiny Asian or have a super tiny build, buy this.",24792,2
24792,"If you are a tiny size zero American, this may be too tight on you.",24792,2
24792,"However, if you are a bigger girl (size 12+) this will fit perfectly around your thigh.",24792,2
24793,"I would recommend it for someone who's built like a model, tall and thin.",24793,2
24793,The material is not great but you get what you pay for.,24793,2
24794,I just received my item and it has a Defaut!,24794,2
24795,Just Meh.,24795,2
24796,"It is too warm for us, top fits 2.5y but pants are way too long",24796,2
24797,Everywhere fits fine except across the chest and a little in the shoulder.,24797,2
24797,WAAY to tight.,24797,2
24797,Gave it to a friend.,24797,2
24798,I'm giving the product 2.5 stars because that's the average of two scores.,24798,2
24798,"I give it 4 stars for looks, quality for the price, and affordability.",24798,2
24798,I give it 1 star for the AWFUL smell that exudes from the imitation leather- totally disgusting.,24798,2
24798,"I like how the product looks and I'm happy with it's functionality, so I'm hoping that the sewer-like smell will dissipate over a few days as I leave it outside to air.",24798,2
24798,I will update my review accordingly.,24798,2
24798,"Update 10/21/16: It took a couple of weeks outside for the smell to dissipate but, even now after more than a month, there is still a faint smell to the item.",24798,2
24798,I would not get this item again.,24798,2
24799,"Ordered 6 of these shirts in mint for a team event, but the XL came in a dark teal.",24799,2
24799,I returned it and reordered thinking maybe someone picked the wrong color by mistake but it came in dark teal again.,24799,2
24799,Picture to show color difference.,24799,2
24799,The shirt itself is nice and comfortable but the color does not match the description at all.,24799,2
24800,"Did not liked fabric feels, not pretty as photo show, I gave it away.",24800,2
24801,Guess this one runs small - I have purchased several items from PattyBoutik and have always ordered a small,24801,2
24802,Tarnished after less than an hour of wearing..,24802,2
24802,"I mean I know it's not gold, but I was very disappointed in the quality..",24802,2
24803,ok,24803,2
24804,They should let you know that it is see through and you must wear something under it !,24804,2
24804,!,24804,2
24804,!,24804,2
24805,Made very poorly,24805,2
24806,I love the look and the fit.,24806,2
24806,I would easily give them 5 stars if the paint did not cause skin irritation.,24806,2
24806,"I've had 3 pair of these, different colors.",24806,2
24806,The first pair's paint started to peel a couple of months after I got them.,24806,2
24806,"This by itself didn't bother me, but the paint started getting into the skin above my nose and between my eyes and caused bumps and rash.",24806,2
24806,The only way I could make it go away was to quit wearing these sunglasses.,24806,2
24806,I ended up giving all three pair way.,24806,2
24806,"It's a shame, too, because I really did love the colors, fit, and styling of these.",24806,2
24806,I won't buy them again.,24806,2
24807,"This looks almost nothing like how it does on the model, it is cut weirdly and the hood is not nearly as fluffy as it looks in the picture.",24807,2
24807,Buyer beware that this is a knock-off imitation of the hoodie the model is wearing in the picture.,24807,2
24808,"It looks nice but the product is like 2 sizes too small, I wear large as in shirts, so I order a XL, it fits like a medium.",24808,2
24809,Ummmmm....it is cute but the underwire in this bra came crooked.,24809,2
24809,It won't bend back into the shape the underwire should be...,24809,2
24810,"Sleeves were so tight, I couldn't move my arms.",24810,2
24810,Returning.,24810,2
24811,Gave it to a granddaughter.,24811,2
24812,"it is ""LOOSE"" = if you wear size 8",24812,2
24813,This dress was cute but ran large and the hem was odd.,24813,2
24813,The irregular hem was very extreme and hung strangely.,24813,2
24813,I returned it.,24813,2
24814,Cute shirt but at least a size or two smaller then I ordered and it doesn't slant down like the picture I'm currently losing weight so i kept it as my goal shirt.,24814,2
24815,blah!,24815,2
24816,doesn't fit me wish I didn't buy it,24816,2
24817,"Not a big fan of this sun hat, as it feels rather flimsy, doesn't hold its shape very well, and if it gets wet or damp, will immediately fall in front of your baby's face.",24817,2
24817,We stopped using it.,24817,2
24818,Just be cautious the earnings unscrew easily.,24818,2
24819,"I wore these for a couple of months, hoping they would work as a cheaper alternative to the ones I had used for years, however in the end I went back and purchased the more expensive ones.",24819,2
24819,"These were okay, although they definitely have more lift than I personally wanted, they gave me a slight pain in my arch that went away after a short time wearing them.",24819,2
24819,One surprise side-effect that I originally attributed to my shoes was the pain on the top of my foot that I had while wearing these.,24819,2
24819,It seemed I couldn't tie my shoe loosely enough for my foot to not hurt unless it felt like it was about to fall off.,24819,2
24819,"After I replaced these I realized my shoes were not to blame, but these orthodics were.",24819,2
24819,"However, what really drove me to replace them was the fact that I managed to wear a hole through them underneath the ball of my foot within 2-3 months of getting them.",24819,2
24819,"My old footbeds lasted for years (embarrassing as it should probably be that I used them that long) and when they did start to wear out I didn't even realize at first because it didn't really affect the performance much, when these went it was very obvious when I wore them and slightly uncomfortable.",24819,2
24819,"I do lead an active life, usually playing racquetball or running on a treadmill or going for a hike every day, and walking anywhere from 12000-20000 steps a day, but I still expected these to hold up longer than they did.",24819,2
24820,I used this set on two occasions.,24820,2
24820,The first time I loved it.,24820,2
24820,The second stone I used it my fingers actually started to turn green,24820,2
24821,Not at all,24821,2
24822,Too small!!!!!,24822,2
24822,!,24822,2
24823,Didn't wrap my ear right.,24823,2
24823,Too heavy.,24823,2
24823,Loe the little one.,24823,2
24824,Like it but ribbon broke off  so wasn't able to wear it.,24824,2
24824,Tried to repair it but no success!,24824,2
24825,Can hardly fit..,24825,2
24826,I ordered these for the Ivory leggings.,24826,2
24826,They were see through and more like tights so I ended up sending them back.,24826,2
24826,They fit fine and as expected.,24826,2
24827,The gloves are nice but they are TINY!!!,24827,2
24827,My 3 year old can't even pull them over his wrists,24827,2
24828,Loose bead upon opening the package.,24828,2
24828,I reattached it myself.,24828,2
24828,Not well made!,24828,2
24829,"Not sure about other styles offered, but this style made all of my shoes too snug to fit comfortably - especially in the toe area.",24829,2
24829,I plan to return these and try a different model.,24829,2
24830,"Super cute, however an XL fit like a medium.",24830,2
24830,Returning only because sizing was way off.,24830,2
24830,If there was a larger size I would get it!,24830,2
24831,The gray stripes are blue,24831,2
24832,"Way too small and on top of that, I'm being bombarded with emails to leave a review.",24832,2
24833,The product itself is of good quality.,24833,2
24833,"In some ways, it is much better than my issue M65 Field Jacket.",24833,2
24833,The sizing is what ruins it.,24833,2
24833,"When I say too large, I'm literally drowning in it.",24833,2
24833,"There were so many reviews on this product, and so much misleading information.",24833,2
24833,It becomes even more confusing if you are on the borderline of two different sizes.,24833,2
24833,"When I enlisted in the Air Force, I was 5'7, 147lbs.",24833,2
24833,"I wore a medium-regular, and it fit perfectly.",24833,2
24833,"Fast forward to today, I'm 5'7, 185lbs.",24833,2
24833,I ordered a medium from Amazon.,24833,2
24833,The tag reads medium-regular.,24833,2
24833,It is way TOO BIG.,24833,2
24833,"Right now, I'm on the verge of a medium or large with T-Shirts and Jackets.",24833,2
24833,It just depends on the maker.,24833,2
24833,"With Columbia, Nautica, Nike & Oakley I wear Medium.",24833,2
24833,"With Gildan T-Shirts, I wear a Large.",24833,2
24834,Neck hole is way too big.,24834,2
24835,I've bought Dickies cargo scrubs before.,24835,2
24835,"They had belt loops, one on each side and one in back, the minimum of belt loops as far as I was concerned.",24835,2
24835,"These ""slim fit"" have only two loops, one near the front on each side, and none in back.",24835,2
24835,"I think that missing loop will contribute to serious ""plumber's butt"", where the pants ride down quite a bit in back.",24835,2
24836,In the picture it looks more like it is black stripes but in person it is definatly blue.,24836,2
24836,You have to have a long torso and a small chest to wear this well.,24836,2
24836,I would love to return but when you order straight from china they tell you that the only way they will return is if you pay for the shipping.,24836,2
24836,Not worth while.,24836,2
24837,"Even though its almost a year still not happy with the coat, in fact i have struggle to sell it because it just doesnt fit right!",24837,2
24837,When i had purchase it it was a diferent coat and received a different one!,24837,2
24837,When i went back to check they have also change the picture of the model with a diferent coat..,24837,2
24837,I don't know what happend there.,24837,2
24837,Definitely never purchasing from this seller again!,24837,2
24838,VERY THIN!,24838,2
24839,So cute but SO much smaller then I hoped it would be!,24839,2
24839,Also much lighter then pictured.,24839,2
24839,"I was thinking LARGE satchel, instead I can't fit most of my usual purse items in the bag.",24839,2
24839,Little bummed about that.,24839,2
24840,"I ordered a large, I'm a size 11, and this looked as though it was made for a teen with a very short torso.",24840,2
24841,Terrible fabric,24841,2
24842,it's too small and complicated to put on--doesn't look like the pic,24842,2
24843,I love this bag.,24843,2
24843,I get a lot of compliments on it.,24843,2
24843,"it's super cute but the tassel on the bag already broke as well as the inside zipper pocket has a hole and it was broken when I received it, I don't use that pocket  but it's still bothersome since I paid for it and waited a while to get it.",24843,2
24843,"PLUS, I haven't had it for very long, About a month, so I'm really not happy about that.",24843,2
24843,"I don't know if I would ever repurchase this bag, although it's cute the quality isn't up to par.",24843,2
24843,"I take good care of my personal items simply because I want them to last a long time, but this totally bummed me out.",24843,2
24844,Cute dress but way too small.,24844,2
24845,Runs extremely small.,24845,2
24845,I normally where a large or extra large.,24845,2
24845,I knew it said runs small so got a 3xl but if you are large chested it will be tight around the bust,24845,2
24846,"I agree that while the top is cute, it is way too small.",24846,2
24846,"I ordered extra large, and this top could fit a kid.",24846,2
24846,"However, the seller did ship the item to me in tact, and on time, so I can't blame the seller much.",24846,2
24846,"But, it would be nice to see a note attached to the item, informing the customer that the item runs very small.",24846,2
24846,"Other than that, I have no further complaints.",24846,2
24847,Crushed the nose,24847,2
24848,"It's  cute, but it is super tiny and flat.",24848,2
24848,I didn't like it way to small.,24848,2
24849,Worked flawless for 8 months then died without warning.,24849,2
24849,"The winder has 2 motors, 1 that drives the watch base to the left, which still works and 1 the drives the 2 watch bases, middle and right.",24849,2
24849,"The motor that drives the 2 watch bases gave out, which makes me wonder if it was overworked.",24849,2
24850,To small.,24850,2
24850,I'm zise L and it fits like a small but I will not return it because it fits my teenage daughter overall great design with beautiful details.,24850,2
24851,"I normally wear a medium in women's T-shirts, so that's what I ordered here & I can honestly say that only if you're an X-Small should you order a medium.",24851,2
24851,Tight is an understatement!,24851,2
24851,I'd definitely suggest going with a L or XL if you're a medium!,24851,2
24852,Sizing smaller than expected,24852,2
24853,The back of this pin ruins it.,24853,2
24853,"The rest - style, material, durability is great, but the back of this pin is a large rubber nodule that WILL poke you no matter what you pin this to - unless it's a backpack strap.",24853,2
24854,small across the back.,24854,2
24854,fabric lighter than I anticipated.,24854,2
24854,Just didn't fit my body so I gave it away.,24854,2
24855,"I am not a huge busted girl, normally wear a large.",24855,2
24855,After reading reviews about the size I ordered the extra  extra larges.,24855,2
24855,"When they showed up they seem like nice material, but I could barely even squeeze my girls into these bras!",24855,2
24855,So I sent them back.,24855,2
24855,If I had a smaller chest I would probably like these bras.,24855,2
24856,Material is itchy,24856,2
24857,Not that nice,24857,2
24858,The collar was partially frayed.,24858,2
24859,a lot smaller than expected.,24859,2
24860,I ordered the 2X as a gift and when I opened it up it was easily a medium...,24860,2
24860,So be aware these run quite small.,24860,2
24860,Otherwise it was a good shirt.,24860,2
24861,I love this because I love long sweaters.,24861,2
24861,"However, I bought the largest size possible and when I received it I couldn't even button it up without stretching it and the buttons gapping, showing its to small.",24861,2
24861,My friend who is heavy set had the same issue.,24861,2
24861,I will still wear it as a cardigan that can't button because it's cute but this product isn't for bigger chested or heavier girls.,24861,2
24862,"Not my style, returning these",24862,2
24863,The ring is made well.,24863,2
24863,The stones are as expected for the price.,24863,2
24864,"My veil is misshaped and far too large, no matter how I place it in my hair it doesn't look quite right.",24864,2
24864,I was disappointed with this product.,24864,2
24864,Glad I still have time to find another.,24864,2
24865,This dress had a sewing pin in it.,24865,2
24865,It didn't fit properly,24865,2
24866,It doesn't look like the picture the picture shows it as lose but it isn't I got it really tight even thought I got the my size,24866,2
24867,It's to small in length & it didn't fit how I was told it would.,24867,2
24867,I also don't like the material of the bottom half.,24867,2
24868,I bought these initially to wear with a strapless dress.,24868,2
24868,They worked great.,24868,2
24868,"I tried them again a few months later with a looser fitting top and halfway through the day, they started falling off.",24868,2
24868,"If you are buying these to wear with something that is tight and could help hold them on, they will probably work just fine.",24868,2
24868,"However, on the second use with a loose shirt, they would not stick.",24868,2
24869,it is itchy,24869,2
24870,"While these shoes are very well made, the heel is more like a wedge, which does not afford you much stability when walking.",24870,2
24870,"When it comes to platform shoes this high, they really need to consider a chunkier heel.",24870,2
24870,I was terrified of spraining my ankle just walking across carpeting.,24870,2
24870,"I had to send them back, the risks of injury outweighed the cuteness of the shoe.",24870,2
24871,"I like the shirt, but it does not fit the way it does in the picture...",24871,2
24871,"I usually wear a L to XL, but I  read some of the reviews so I ordered two sizes up at an XXL.",24871,2
24871,I think to get it to fit the way it does in the picture I would have had to order 4XL.,24871,2
24871,"The material is nice and the way it fits on me is not terrible, it's just not how it looks in the picture... Not even close.",24871,2
24872,"Top is way too big, bottoms are way too small.",24872,2
24872,All wrong.,24872,2
24873,Love these jackets,24873,2
24874,"I ordered the largest size available since I am a size 18, but it was way too small.",24874,2
24874,I gave the dress to a friend who is a size 10 & it fits her fine.,24874,2
24875,I got these for a gift off my wish list.,24875,2
24875,Not happy at all with them.,24875,2
24875,They are very sheer and thin.,24875,2
24875,"They would work for cosplay or under a dress, but cannot be worn as true leggings.",24875,2
24875,I was hoping for something like yoga pants with a little more style.,24875,2
24875,Nope.,24875,2
24876,"This bra may be comfortable and work well for others, but if you are endowed in the upper region like I am, the cotton stretch type material lacks support and this bra runs very very small.",24876,2
24876,I am normally large and I couldn't even get the bra around to zip up.,24876,2
24876,I would've had to go TWO sizes up.,24876,2
24876,Still looking for something similar to the Under Armour Endure (nylon and very supportive).,24876,2
24876,"They have discontinued it and, hands down, best sports bra ever made.",24876,2
24876,"The search for a: front zip, high impact, sports bra continues.",24876,2
24876,On a five star note:  The seller posted my refund immediately.,24876,2
24877,I could barely get them on my son when I bought them last winter and he was able to get them off pretty easily.,24877,2
24877,Would be better if they were like Grandma's old mittens - connect with a string so at least you don't lose one!,24877,2
24878,"Like the dress, but the sizing is not accurate.",24878,2
24878,It is too small and I won't be able to wear it.,24878,2
24879,This material is so cheap and so sheer!!,24879,2
24879,"You aren't supposed to wear a bra with it, but if you didn't you'd see everything.",24879,2
24879,"I like to dress sexy, but this is just over board.",24879,2
24879,I wore my friend's $60 version of this (the real deal) and it wasn't that revealing.,24879,2
24879,I am 5'3 and a 34D and got a small.,24879,2
24879,will be returning this.,24879,2
24880,These are too small to close again properly.,24880,2
24880,Returned.,24880,2
24881,These are decent orthotics with adequate support/stiffness however these cane too narrow for my shoes.,24881,2
24881,I can feel the edge if the insert against my big toe.,24881,2
24881,The insert should be a little wider.,24881,2
24882,Slathered with sticky gooey leather lubricant.,24882,2
24882,"Gets on my clothes and on hands, especially anything that comes in contact with shoulder strap.",24882,2
24882,I've had this a couple months and it's still very moist and gooey.,24882,2
24882,The goop attracts lint and forms little greasy lint balls.,24882,2
24883,A screw fell out on one of the nose pads.,24883,2
24883,the second I pulled it off from packaging it popped out.,24883,2
24883,Little screw is now lost and glasses sitting on my coffee table.,24883,2
24883,I do understand they were cheap but wished I was able to use without problems instead of having to go get a glasses kit,24883,2
24884,The bottoms are a great fit but unfortunately the top does not match the sizing with them.,24884,2
24884,"Way to small and I have a well proportioned body build, and I ordered a size or two up than what I would typically wear due to the reviews.",24884,2
24884,The 2 stars are for the color it's fun but I can't use the suit!,24884,2
24885,"I was disappointed in the tulle on the dress, very cheaply made and does not hang nice.",24885,2
24885,It seems more like a costume than a party dress.,24885,2
24886,"Piece is tiny, it sits right up against my nose, making it stick out a bit.",24886,2
24886,I would have preferred it hang like others photos.,24886,2
24886,"Clasp is firm, which is always nice, keeps it from coming loose.",24886,2
24886,"But the hinge is loose, it just flops all over the place, making it hard to get in.",24886,2
24886,It sure is pretty though.,24886,2
24887,I ordered a medium (I am 5'6 and about 140 pounds) and I couldn't even get it over my calves.,24887,2
24887,WAYYYYYY too small!!!,24887,2
24887,!,24887,2
24888,"Normally wear a size medium, ordered a large/extra large still fits quite tight but fits.",24888,2
24889,"Loved the material, a size too big for me, but when I put them on they ripped right down the seam!!",24889,2
24889,Do not buy.,24889,2
24889,Waste of money.,24889,2
24890,It was way too big and the quality wasn't as good as I had imagined it to be.,24890,2
24891,Shorts will make noises when walking and my zipper broke when trying it on.,24891,2
24891,I only bought these for the zippered pockets but the zippers are of cheap material.,24891,2
24891,The shorts are comfortable but rub together when walking and make a lot of noise.,24891,2
24892,Way shorter than the picture suggests,24892,2
24893,"I think it's pretty it just sticks out kinda funny at the top in a way I wasn't expecting, I guess I was thinking that one of the gen stones would be like sitting on the skin like the top ball on a different ring but it works.",24893,2
24894,Just got my keychain today.,24894,2
24894,"I love the look of it, my only problem is that it doesn't feel secure like it should.",24894,2
24894,The part my keys go on just feels wobbly when it's clipped in.,24894,2
24895,Returned it because it was too small.,24895,2
24896,the tail color came off almost immediately.,24896,2
24896,The top was a weird fit.,24896,2
24896,It did not fit to the body at all.,24896,2
24896,The bottoms had no elastic on the edges.,24896,2
24896,We threw the bathing suit away and only use the tail.,24896,2
24897,Somewhat Small.,24897,2
24897,I haven't time to send it back,24897,2
24898,It's a gorgeous hat I wish I bought sooner,24898,2
24899,"It fit fairly well, but I just didn't like the quality and the much-darker background color.",24899,2
24899,It didn't work with my skin color.,24899,2
24899,It's a weird beige-yellow.,24899,2
24899,"Also, the dress was just too short.",24899,2
24900,The value matched the cost.,24900,2
24900,Pood,24900,2
24901,"runs big, very pretty dress , but buy a smaller size",24901,2
24902,sizing way off,24902,2
24903,losing the gold after 4 wears,24903,2
24904,The case has some black marks on it.,24904,2
24904,Like glue or a marker .,24904,2
24905,"There are good and bad things about these shoes, however the bad outweighs the good.",24905,2
24905,The measurements you send will be the ones they use.,24905,2
24905,If you give exact measurements they may not fit the best.,24905,2
24905,I made this mistake and they were quite snug.,24905,2
24905,"The height that you send is where the boot is going to lay, and if you want them to go above your knee like in the series measure above your knee.",24905,2
24905,"Furthermore, I am a cosplayer and try to go to cons several times a year.",24905,2
24905,"I got these last year and they worked fine, and it isn't like I wore them constantly.",24905,2
24905,"However, as time went on the seams on top of my foot started to rip and I had to re-sew it and then later I had to repeat this on the other boot.",24905,2
24905,The zipper on one of the boots ripped away the boot and I was unable to zip it up at all.,24905,2
24905,I was quite upset with this and I might have to get new boots within a year of having purchased these.,24905,2
24905,I expected these would last longer considering the price.,24905,2
24905,"Also, the boots do not have comfort soles so I recommend purchasing them if you don't want your feet to hurt.",24905,2
24906,"I like the simple styling of this slip, but even for tea length, it was really long.",24906,2
24906,I had to hem it 3 inches and also sew up a hole in one of the seams.,24906,2
24906,Kind of overpriced for what it is.,24906,2
24906,Had to keep it though since girls' slips are hard to find in stores.,24906,2
24907,"The price was good, the color was good, the design was good, the size is really off.",24907,2
24907,The measurements are not what they say in the description.,24907,2
24907,"It's good for a little teenager girl, or a very petite woman.",24907,2
24907,I just will find someone to give it to.,24907,2
24908,"First, these are very comfortable.",24908,2
24908,"However, the leg holes on them stretch out making them unwearable.",24908,2
24908,Do far it has only happened with the dark blue ones.,24908,2
24908,So it could be a fabric issue or who ever is in charge of the dark blues at the undie factory is asleep at the wheel.,24908,2
24908,I have had to throw away quite a few of them.,24908,2
24909,Bra fit great and I love how it was padded for the push up!,24909,2
24909,3 days later of wearing bra the clasp broke on the adjustment strap :( Now I have a safety pin there.......,24909,2
24909,The fabric quality is good.,24909,2
24910,Way small but it is from china so its expected.,24910,2
24910,Pretty though,24910,2
24911,These are much too small.,24911,2
24911,Cannot really wear them comfortably.,24911,2
24911,A large turns out to be more like a small.,24911,2
24911,Prob won't order again.,24911,2
24912,Very light material and a little small in the chest.,24912,2
24912,"As others have said, the sleeves are too long, coming past the elbows.",24912,2
24912,I won't buy again.,24912,2
24913,"This was soooo cute when it arrived, and I ordered a size up.",24913,2
24913,"I'm 5'6"", and currently weigh 120.",24913,2
24913,"The bottom and size fit beautifully, but unfortunately, the chest part was about 4 inches below my actual breasts.",24913,2
24913,"It must be for someone with a very, very short torso.",24913,2
24913,"I'm so bummed, because this was going to be the perfect post-baby swim suit for me.",24913,2
24914,"This skirt is only 18.5"" long so if you are taller than 4'11"" it will not reach your knees.",24914,2
24914,"I assumed when I ordered the skirt that it was for women of regular height and a skirt advertised as knee length would be about 22"" long at least.",24914,2
24914,So if you like your skirts short this one will be fine.,24914,2
24914,Too bad the size chart does not mention length.,24914,2
24914,This skirt should have been listed as knee length for women under 5'.,24914,2
24915,Soft fabric but too short and awkwardly proportioned.,24915,2
24915,Not sure how it looks so nice on the model!,24915,2
24915,Ordered size small as I'm 5'4 and normal weight.,24915,2
24915,Not so flattering for a beach cover-up.,24915,2
24916,"Jersey fits no problem, shorts are so small I can use them as underwear.",24916,2
24917,Average quality.,24917,2
24918,"I wish I would have read the ""customer questions"" about the gauge of these.",24918,2
24918,They did not fit in my cartilage at all and it was even hard for me to put the ball back on when I gave up on trying to shove the earring in...so couldn't imagine being able to put them on if they were in my ear.,24918,2
24919,"The skirt appears to be a gathered circle , but it isn't.",24919,2
24919,It is not full at all.,24919,2
24920,Did not receive this product receive a oval pair not circle picture is misleading.,24920,2
24921,"Quite a few broke when first putting them on, the balls are a cheap plastic.",24921,2
24922,"Looks like a tent on my 5'1"" 126lbs frame.",24922,2
24922,I bought the medium.,24922,2
24922,Fitted through the arms and tent-like elsewhere.,24922,2
24922,Don't do it!,24922,2
24922,Sending it back.,24922,2
24923,"I loved the style of this top, ordered it once my original size medium, WAY to small, returned item and of course paid the shipping to return.",24923,2
24923,"FINALLY decided I wanted to try again, ordered a large, WAY to large, looks more like a 2XL than a large!!!",24923,2
24923,WOW now I pay again to return.,24923,2
24923,"Fortunately I ordered another top the Lotus Flower T-Back in a large, NOW this large is a large!!",24923,2
24923,Will stay clear of Yoga Clothing for now!!!,24923,2
24923,!,24923,2
24924,"very sheer, more of a nighty than a dress",24924,2
24925,"It was too Small, The the suit is really cute!",24925,2
24926,This product is not as photographed.,24926,2
24926,It is not an empire waist but rather a high waist that looks weird.,24926,2
24926,The skirt is tighter than the upper part.,24926,2
24926,I have a petite skinny frame and gotten a small which has baggy chest area and a tight bottom.,24926,2
24926,The colors are nice but the fabric is not very flowy.,24926,2
24926,I ended up sending it back because it is not as shown here.,24926,2
24927,"I didn't quite know what I was getting into, or what to expect while ordering this, but I wish I did.",24927,2
24927,"The sole purpose for me to buy this was to make other things with it, so I wasn't going to be picky.",24927,2
24927,"You should know that it is not push up, meaning there is no padding other than the thin and hard molded cups.",24927,2
24927,"The adhesive is not sufficient in holding up any sized boobs, and the cups run big.",24927,2
24927,"Overall, with some changes, I was able to make it work, but I would not recommend getting this for strapless/backless garments.",24927,2
24928,"Cheaply made, there are small specs of gold weaved into the fabric, which I was not expecting.",24928,2
24928,"Fit was very narrow, I'm usually a S, XS, but medium was tight in the shoulders even though I measured beforehand.",24928,2
24928,Quality is a step or two below F21.,24928,2
24929,"I'm 5'7"" 170 so I bought this in a larger;width wise it fit fine...but the length of it is way off & i would not be able to wear this anywhere!",24929,2
24930,20% of the stones are falling,24930,2
24931,very pretty the extra large if for 8 year old,24931,2
24932,Way smaller than expected.,24932,2
24932,Bought as a gift.,24932,2
24933,more like knee socks.,24933,2
24933,"they come up to my knee, not over it.",24933,2
24933,Definitely not thigh highs.,24933,2
24934,I should have gotten a larger size xL looked like it could fit a 10 year old girl,24934,2
24935,The frame is sturdy and I feel looks good.,24935,2
24935,The view through the lenses seemed off and was not comfortable.,24935,2
24935,I just didn't have the same view from all angles.,24935,2
24936,I ordered this skirt because of the good reviews and was disappointed.,24936,2
24936,"First, the skirt is beautiful but the material it is made with is completely see-through when stretched.",24936,2
24936,"I could even see my flesh colored panties and pantie line with a slip on  --- I ordered an extra large, I have a small waist but bigger hips and it fit well but if I bent over or moved in any way you could see the tan color of panties.",24936,2
24936,Either the 5-star reviews didn't notice you can see through the back....or I was sent a defective product?,24936,2
24936,"Either way, I am sending it back and giving it 2 stars because the roses are pretty.",24936,2
24936,If you buy this I would size up and def wear something under it or pair it with a long shirt that covers your bum to avoid an embarrassing situation  - in a well-lit room you will be able to see straight through.,24936,2
24937,Size runs very small.,24937,2
24938,would have loved the sweatshirt but I couldn't even fit it over my head,24938,2
24939,pretty small on my very slender 2 year old.,24939,2
24939,She had marks on her side when I took them off.,24939,2
24939,I just need to get a bigger size.,24939,2
24939,"Other than that, they are great.",24939,2
24940,it too big.,24940,2
24941,The photograph does not actually depict the color properly,24941,2
24942,Not sturdy at all,24942,2
24943,"The color of the bag, grey, is not dark which is why I ordered it.",24943,2
24943,The color is more like a faded olive green.,24943,2
24943,Disappointed.,24943,2
24944,These are not warm.,24944,2
24944,They kept my hands dry but not warm.,24944,2
24945,"Well, if this isn't the most conspicuous packaging I've ever seen.",24945,2
24945,"Webundies.com sounds like some site you'd go to when you want to buy used women's panties, not baby pajamas.",24945,2
24945,I bet my mail-lady used hand sanitizer after she dropped this package off.,24945,2
24945,"My husband even got all frisky when he saw the package, ""Oh, Mama!",24945,2
24945,"What did YOU buy??""",24945,2
24945,Brobee pajamas.,24945,2
24945,I bought jammies with Yo Gabba Gabba on them.,24945,2
24945,"Now my husband is disappointed, and I can never look the mail-lady in the eye again.",24945,2
24945,2 stars.,24945,2
24946,The back of it fell off the first time I wore it.,24946,2
24946,The band has more of a yellow look than a gold look.,24946,2
24946,But you can't expect a lot you get what you pay for.,24946,2
24946,It only cost six dollars.,24946,2
24946,Don't recommend to buy it.,24946,2
24946,You'll only get to wear it once.,24946,2
24947,The tag was ripped off.,24947,2
24947,Shirt looks new but the tag was clearly ripped off on purpose and that is no good :(,24947,2
24948,Wish they offered a Xs.,24948,2
24948,The small seems a bit to large for my frame.,24948,2
24948,I will try to shrink it in the dryer and see how it comes out:/,24948,2
24949,It's ok. Rhinestones aren't aligned well along the edge of flap.,24949,2
24949,Seems like a knock off.,24949,2
24949,But will be fine for the price,24949,2
24950,This bathing suit runs really really small.,24950,2
24950,I usually wear a 10/12 (Medium) in US sizes.,24950,2
24950,I returned the medium and ordered a XL.,24950,2
24950,"It still didn't fit, I finally had to order the XXXL.",24950,2
24950,This bathing suit doesn't stretch at all or have any give.,24950,2
24951,"So I though they were going to be completely flat,  but the material is kind of flimsly that it bends inward towards my nose.",24951,2
24951,I love the style just hate that they bend,24951,2
24952,This just...is.,24952,2
24952,"It hangs, is sloppy, no shape and the material is some sort of terrible cheap polyester.",24952,2
24952,"I know it's less than $14, so why complain, but I do have higher expectations I guess for materials.",24952,2
24953,"Very, very stiff.",24953,2
24953,"I thought that it might give a little as it warmed up and got used, but nothing.",24953,2
24953,You cant even use the draw string at the top to close the purse.,24953,2
24953,Its very open leaving my stuff on show.,24953,2
24953,"Don't really like it, but having spent my fun money for a month I must wait to try and purchase another.",24953,2
24953,"It is very large with nice compartments, I just wish it had been made out of better material.",24953,2
24954,They're not very comfortable to wear; rub rash on my thighs isn't all that awesome out in public.,24954,2
24954,":(
The netting for the pouch is okay, but the contsticing fabric around the pouch is less than satisfying.",24954,2
24955,"The shipping was insanely fast, which was great.",24955,2
24955,Wish I would have received what I ordered.,24955,2
24955,"The shirt that came is similar, same sleeves and overall shape, but a very light gray with a high collar.",24955,2
24955,"The one I got is nice, very light material, washed well, just not what I was looking for.",24955,2
24956,hate the fabic,24956,2
24957,Order a large more like a small or medium,24957,2
24958,"itchy and tight arms, baggy and plastic-y shirt",24958,2
24959,"There is no sparkle to the earrings, but they're okay for now since they're cheap ones..",24959,2
24960,Not lace.,24960,2
24960,"While this has a good look on, it is definitely not lace.",24960,2
24960,It is polyester and does not look like the picture.,24960,2
24960,The only way you can see through the material is to hold it up to a lamp.,24960,2
24960,If you want a duster that is not see-through this would be good.,24960,2
24961,"I did not care for this bag, it looked cheap in person and flaked.",24961,2
24962,The bottoms are great.,24962,2
24962,The top is unwearable.,24962,2
24962,It has no structure and little shape.,24962,2
24963,"I bought this for my 15 year old daughter and although it does fit, there isn't as much fabric as I would like for the back of the bottom piece.",24963,2
24963,I was disappointed.,24963,2
24963,Why are so many bathing suits so high cut in back?,24963,2
24964,This item ran way small!!!,24964,2
24964,I used the size chart exactly and it was probably 2 sizes too small causing it to bunch up in the waist.,24964,2
24965,Bought  large for myself and it fit my 10 year old daughter perfect and she's your average size 10 year old.,24965,2
24965,It didn't look like the picture either very thick and not so comfortable material,24965,2
24966,I ordered 2 to use as friendship/diffuser bracelets.,24966,2
24966,One came just as pictured.,24966,2
24966,"On the second one, the fixed bead furthest from the center was too far away, making it asymmetrical.",24966,2
24966,I have requested a replacement.,24966,2
24967,He wears a 2T  this would fit a 12 month not a 2T.,24967,2
24968,Did not fit well.,24968,2
24968,Some  areas were not fitting close to the body as should be .,24968,2
24969,One side is longer than the other so it looks  retarded,24969,2
24970,Sketchers shoes do not last for the long haul.,24970,2
24970,"After my daughter wore these for 2 weeks, they looked trashed!",24970,2
24971,The nose pieces are not in the right place and they look larger in real life than in the picture,24971,2
24972,Short,24972,2
24973,UPDATE;  OK  I received my watch back from Citizen and they found nothing wrong with it except it was not charged.,24973,2
24973,They charged it and it now functions fine.,24973,2
24973,"So, for my purposes this product did not work.",24973,2
24973,"Simply put, the jury is still out on this product.",24973,2
24973,I'm not convinced my watch's power cell is working as purchased either.,24973,2
24973,"To date though, this LED charger has not added charge to my watch even after 72 plus hours of constant exposure to its lighting setup.",24973,2
24973,More when I know it.,24973,2
24974,"My wife purchased the ""OVERMAL Handmade Adjustable Rudder Anchor Charms Multilayer Bracelet Wristband"" for me as a Christmas gift and this item is terrible!",24974,2
24974,The clasp broke after wearing this item for the very first time!,24974,2
24974,I sent a message to the Seller and my request for a replacement went unnoticed (Seller did not reply) which is really disappointing!,24974,2
24974,"My wife is understandingly upset, too!",24974,2
24974,I hope that the Seller (MFR) and/or Amazon.com will take note and supply me with a new product at no charge to me.,24974,2
24975,Spikes blue one fits well and clips on easily.,24975,2
24975,Very pretty as well!,24975,2
24975,The only thing is that it's longer than I anticipated and kind of loose.,24975,2
24975,The lacey one was super long and loose and hard to clip on and off.,24975,2
24975,Didn't take a pic with it b/c I didn't really like it,24975,2
24976,I love the way they feel-But I don't like the fact that they shed-all the time you If you walk on a rug r throw rugs.,24976,2
24976,"Fuzz gets on the Rugs, I have to vacuum the fuzz up.",24976,2
24976,It sticks to rugs.,24976,2
24976,It really doesn't matter how good they feel-it's not worth it,24976,2
24977,too small,24977,2
24978,Get a size higher in the USA.,24978,2
24978,Too tight with your normal size.,24978,2
24979,Fit too small,24979,2
24980,Nice but cheap,24980,2
24981,The shirt was too large.,24981,2
24981,Skirt was ok,24981,2
24982,hurts and  you can see the middle easily.,24982,2
24982,Spend a few more bucks and get a good one,24982,2
24983,"I ordered based off my measurements for a large, I usually wear a medium but went with the size chart and it was way too small.",24983,2
24983,"Also, the description and pictures you cannot tell unless you look closely the back top portion of the shirt is a sheer see through material.",24983,2
24983,This is also not your average high low.,24983,2
24983,The high part in the front is completely midriff.,24983,2
24983,That may be because it is too small on me in the first place.,24983,2
24983,"But I do not think even an XL will fit me and I'm 5' 3"" and 138 lbs.",24983,2
24984,"They market these as leggings, but they are see you!",24984,2
24984,"The quality is nice, but they look like opaque tights rather than leggings...",24984,2
24985,Beautiful style by it's at least two sizes too small.,24985,2
24986,just hung on me,24986,2
24987,i did the size chart  and it still came too big,24987,2
24988,Doesn't look like the picture,24988,2
24989,Don't like the quality of the shirt,24989,2
24990,WAY TOO SMALL .,24990,2
24990,"i'm 5'3"" and about 140 with a 36c bust.",24990,2
24990,this top just barely covers my breasts...,24990,2
24991,"the sleaves are a little short and the bottom keep coming up, I don't really like it at all",24991,2
24992,Thin material and fit weird,24992,2
24993,Sizing was way off.,24993,2
24993,Looks like it was cheaply made.,24993,2
24994,"Just as a warning, this bathing suit is a LOT more open on the sides than what it looks like in the pictures.",24994,2
24994,It is not just a small cutout on the side.,24994,2
24994,"So if you are thinking this would be a good bathing suit to camoflauge your midsection, it is not, because you can see most of your midsection from the side cutout panels.",24994,2
24994,"I really wanted to love this bathing suit, and it would be great for someone who is ok showing off their midsection, but it is not for someone who is self-conscious about that area.",24994,2
24995,These earrings are HUGE and HEAVY.,24995,2
24995,"Very uncomfortable to wear, will have to repurpose as necklace.",24995,2
24996,No good material,24996,2
24997,"Poor quality, hung weird, top was not very long and bottom was too long.",24997,2
24997,Just a strange fit.,24997,2
24997,Fabric was full pleats which is hard to see in the pic.,24997,2
24997,The neck was frayed.,24997,2
24997,Hummm.,24997,2
24997,I sent it back.,24997,2
24998,"I liked the suit itself,  but I ordered a Med and got a large....it appears to be a computer glitch.",24998,2
24998,"Because when I tried to order it again, it changed the order to large instead of med.",24998,2
24999,It fit somewhat large and the button on the back fell off as soon as I pulled it out the bag but luckily I know how to sew,24999,2
25000,The seams appeared to be coming a part after one wear.,25000,2
25000,Bummer: potentially lovely.,25000,2
25000,The design on top is also a bit sticky; I would have prefered an all over soft touch with cool design.,25000,2
25000,"Maybe a new version with these updates will be designed, a little roomier, too.",25000,2
25001,just ok,25001,2
25002,I ordered two of these shirts in size 3XL.,25002,2
25002,"The patterns were nice, colors as advertised, but they're sized for a slim fit.",25002,2
25002,They were very snug on me.,25002,2
25002,I will donate them to charity and buy another brand,25002,2
25003,The only problem is the chain kept slipping off my shoulder.,25003,2
25004,This is a nice light weight dress that fits well.,25004,2
25004,"I was disappointed that the first time I wore the dress, the seam came undone in the left shoulder.",25004,2
25004,"I now have to have it fixed before I can wear it again, not to mention I was scrambling to fix the mistake while out of town without something else nice to wear.",25004,2
25005,Material is rough and way too small.,25005,2
25005,Very uncomfortable.,25005,2
25006,Too wide and thick,25006,2
25007,I ordered 4 to 12 months.,25007,2
25007,I was excited to open the package.,25007,2
25007,"The item itself are okay, but I received a size 12 to 18 months.",25007,2
25007,I am dissapointed and it's hassle for me to return and order again.,25007,2
25008,"Certainly not ""sweatshirt"" material.",25008,2
25008,It's more T-shirt thin.,25008,2
25008,Color was as described.,25008,2
25009,These must have been made for someone 5' tall.,25009,2
25009,"I'm 5'6"" and they are at least 6""short.",25009,2
25009,And I bought two pair!,25009,2
25009,Crap!,25009,2
25009,"While they were uncomfortable, I still managed to wear them by putting jeans on.",25009,2
25009,They are warm!,25009,2
25010,This dress is cheaply made and the fabric faded almost immediately.,25010,2
25011,Cute.,25011,2
25012,Looks nice from far away.,25012,2
25012,But once you touch it you realize the poor quality.,25012,2
25013,"I first bought a size 5, but they were way too big.",25013,2
25013,"So, I thought I'd keep those for when she grows into them and ordered a size 4.",25013,2
25013,"The size 4 fit (her foot is 4.5""), but these shoes will not stay on her feet.",25013,2
25013,The hole for the ankle goes too low on her foot and it just slips out.,25013,2
25013,Kind of useless for me right now.,25013,2
25014,"It is very cute but if I knew the size wouldn't other it , with the picture don't expect it to be so small and not able to put bills in it.",25014,2
25015,I like .,25015,2
25015,recomendation,25015,2
25016,The earrings were a lot bigger inperson than I thought they would be.,25016,2
25016,Be sure and note the size before you purchase.,25016,2
25017,Awful fit.,25017,2
25018,Too small it looks like it can fit a 4 year old!,25018,2
25018,I had to give away!,25018,2
25019,Way too small.,25019,2
25019,Order at least 2 sizes up.,25019,2
25019,disappointed.,25019,2
25020,"I have been looking into this 90s trend that's coming back, and I thought this one would be so cute.",25020,2
25020,I got it in the mail and when I went to put it on the clasp fell out of the hook.,25020,2
25020,I was really bummed because it was such a cute choker in person too...I didn't get to wear it and returned it.,25020,2
25021,"Very pretty, but it broke the first time I wore it.",25021,2
25021,Would not buy again.,25021,2
25022,I bought these and they seemed like they were some weird inbetween size.,25022,2
25022,"I bought them to be the same size my ears already were and they were  bigger, but not as big as the next size up.",25022,2
25022,"So I haven't gotten to wear them yet  unless I decide to stretch my ears a size up, but then these might be to small.",25022,2
25023,Way to small .,25023,2
25023,is not exactly like the picture,25023,2
25024,Thought it would be a fun wintertime cap...,25024,2
25024,"However, it is made of very low quality material and cheaply made, especially with a $20 price tag.",25024,2
25024,Very disappointing.,25024,2
25025,it broke right away.,25025,2
25025,the color is so pale you can't tell what it is,25025,2
25026,"This is not a cardigan, nor a split wrap, but a FAUX cardigan split wrap.",25026,2
25026,"Adorable, fits a little small.",25026,2
25026,If only it were not sewn together in the front I would have kept it.,25026,2
25027,The neck is really large and the shoulders are really tight.,25027,2
25027,Runs small to.,25027,2
25027,But the saying is cute,25027,2
25028,"I bought two of these, because I love alpaca, which is expensive, but worth it because it's so warm.",25028,2
25028,But these are so scratchy that I can't wear them.,25028,2
25028,Unfortunately I missed the return deadline.,25028,2
25029,This is not red says pnk right on package tight 18,25029,2
25030,Thanks,25030,2
25031,It was too small but served its purpose,25031,2
25032,"This purse was lovely at first , then 2 weeks into having it it started ripping ..",25032,2
25032,I don't suggest anyone to buy this for long term use,25032,2
25033,nice looking shoes but its hard to secure your foot due to the additional tongue,25033,2
25034,"The print is adorable, and the shorts really aren't horrible.",25034,2
25034,"The top, however, is much too flimsy, which makes it look like I wrapped a piece of fabric around my boobs.",25034,2
25035,Cute top however the string is too long and stretches easily.,25035,2
25035,I had to tie in order to keep my boobs from popping out.,25035,2
25035,Very inconvenient and bothersome ...,25035,2
25035,I wouldn't buy again,25035,2
25036,quality is cheaply made.,25036,2
25037,It had a couple loose stitches and scruffs here & there but you can carefully pull them off pretty easily.,25037,2
25037,"Yes it is cheap material, but you get what you pay for at just $13.",25037,2
25037,I love the design/fit though!,25037,2
25037,"I'm 5'7, 130 lbs and a 34D and I got the medium.",25037,2
25037,Honestly that was the wrong choice; I'm spilling out of the top and the bottoms are a bit too snug.,25037,2
25037,But I'm gonna try to exchange it for a large because I truly do like the print and fit.,25037,2
25037,Normally I wouldn't advise this but try ordering two sizes up--it runs really small.,25037,2
25038,"Not what I expected, disappointed in the quality",25038,2
25039,sleeves and torso too tight for sizing,25039,2
25040,It came smashed.,25040,2
25040,":-( Otherwise, it was cute but I couldn't wear it.",25040,2
25041,The material is of good quality.,25041,2
25041,However the romper is too short and too wide!,25041,2
25041,Im 5'1 and it is practically riding up my rear.,25041,2
25041,If it were an inch longer and about 6 inches narrower it would have fit perfectly.,25041,2
25041,As it is made it looks like a giant square/almost rectangle.,25041,2
25042,"For the price I didn't expect anything fancy but I at least expected it to be decent, it is very poor quality in materials.",25042,2
25042,Embarrassingly cheap.,25042,2
25042,Will not use.,25042,2
25043,Bought these for my wife and they were too small she is 34D.,25043,2
25043,"Will still try em for the dress she bought but would consider another brand, perhaps to be true to size.",25043,2
25043,Sizing chart specified the large size would fit.,25043,2
25044,Beautiful dress.,25044,2
25044,"However, the  sequins were very scratchy underneath my armpit area and caused  me multiple scratches and discomfort.",25044,2
25044,"Therefore, I could not wear the dress!!",25044,2
25044,I believe this dress came defective.,25044,2
25044,I would  recommend if you do get this dress that you order a size up.,25044,2
25044,It fit me too snug especially around the bust & thigh areas!,25044,2
25044,I would not have felt comfortable all night long in this dress.,25044,2
25044,I normally  wear a size 6 and I ordered the large but should have ordered the extra large.,25044,2
25044,Look at the size description not the size chart when you order this dress.,25044,2
25045,Wayy too small and an odd length,25045,2
25046,broke did not last long,25046,2
25047,I did not order it.,25047,2
25047,Why was it sent to me?,25047,2
25047,Fun color.,25047,2
25047,Probably works for some people.,25047,2
25047,I was just puzzled why it was sent to me.,25047,2
25048,Like couple people have mentioned it doesn't stay on your shoes.,25048,2
25048,The grip definitely works well but it doesn't help if it peels off within a day.,25048,2
25049,material is super thin and see through!,25049,2
25050,Got a size small and it looked like a potato sack on me.,25050,2
25050,"I'm 5'1, slim bodied.",25050,2
25050,Itd prob look better on a taller person.,25050,2
25050,Quality is better than expected tho,25050,2
25051,Thin cheap material,25051,2
25052,Very very thin.,25052,2
25053,"Ok....,,,,the design are only for young teen to wear",25053,2
25054,"It looks nice out of the package, but it isn't well made.",25054,2
25054,"I very carefully removed the tag, and the stitches holding the elastic on unraveled.",25054,2
25054,It's already falling apart.,25054,2
25055,I'm a size 24/0 and these were ginormous and super loose on me.,25055,2
25056,It didn't look anything like the picture.,25056,2
25056,Looked cheap and very fake.,25056,2
25056,I have smaller legs and this looked hilarious on me!!,25056,2
25056,It wouldn't even stay pulled up.,25056,2
25056,Not a good product.,25056,2
25056,"Good idea, but not for me.",25056,2
25057,Wasn't what I thought it was..,25057,2
25057,I was expecting the matiral to be a bit harder with more support thin this.,25057,2
25057,When I put it did not shape or keep anything in!,25057,2
25057,I would not recommend this if you wanted to work out in ..,25057,2
25058,Solid build but too small for face.,25058,2
25058,I even had other people try them on and they all said the same thing,25058,2
25059,I bought a large and am 5.4 and 125... Not in love but I am short waisted.,25059,2
25059,Will probably return...,25059,2
25060,This dress is nice but doesn't look like the picture.,25060,2
25060,The batwing does not spill to front it's only on the back.,25060,2
25060,But still a nice dress but not what I wanted.,25060,2
25061,Some what small,25061,2
25062,Not as flattering as other designs similar to this,25062,2
25063,"This bathing suit was ""okay.""",25063,2
25063,Nothing great.,25063,2
25063,The white breasts lining showed whenever I moved my body to the left or right.,25063,2
25063,Not attractive!,25063,2
25063,"It is made well, and I ordered a size up, as everyone suggested.",25063,2
25063,"I'm a 34B cup size, and this barely covered my breasts, so I can't imagine a bigger chested woman dealing with this swimsuit.",25063,2
25063,Only good for tanning!,25063,2
25063,Don't even think about swimming or jumping off a diving board with this sucker on!,25063,2
25063,haha.,25063,2
25064,Cute but a tad small on my chest,25064,2
25065,Not a fan.,25065,2
25065,"Very cute, but lasted a week before large tears appeared in the picture portion of the backpack.",25065,2
25065,"My son is not particularly hard on back packs, the last one held up for 2 and a half years before there was even a minor issue with the integrity of the fabric.",25065,2
25065,This one is not up to the challenge of being a backpack.,25065,2
25065,"Most likely wonderful as wall decor, but do NOT purchase with the intent of using the item.",25065,2
25066,Ordered in gold but got silver.,25066,2
25066,Was disappointed but didn't wanna go through the hassle of returning it.,25066,2
25066,They're ok bracelets,25066,2
25067,"I ordered XL, but its so small that it might fit a 12 year old.",25067,2
25068,too small,25068,2
25069,I have to echo at least one review in this column.,25069,2
25069,I am a medium-sized man with what I believe is a medium-sized wrist.,25069,2
25069,My Seiko has a metal link band that - once adjusted - is fixed at that length.,25069,2
25069,One reviewer said he got a second holder for a smaller watch.,25069,2
25069,"I only got one holder, and, with all three spring-loaded extensions retracted, I could not get my watch onto the holder.",25069,2
25069,"If your watch has an expansion band, or a leather band that can be opened up, it should work for you.",25069,2
25069,The winder is heavy and seems to be good quality.,25069,2
25069,"I didn't want to send it back, but I had to.",25069,2
25070,small for a large,25070,2
25071,Super cute but these started to smell after just a few times using them.... WITH PROPER WASHING,25071,2
25072,sent back,25072,2
25073,The dress seems to run small,25073,2
25074,The back is shear and shows your full bra in back.,25074,2
25074,Not a style I ilke.,25074,2
25074,I will be returning it.,25074,2
25075,Didn't like the fabric,25075,2
25076,"Completely see through, only good for pj's",25076,2
25077,Not great...,25077,2
25077,I wonder if these are real...,25077,2
25078,Not very well made.,25078,2
25078,Looks super cheap.,25078,2
25078,Sorry to say because it look like it was going to be really cute.,25078,2
25078,Unfortunate.,25078,2
25079,"I don't know what these would be god for except to wear over pants in very cold weather, They are way too big and fall down when I stand up.",25079,2
25080,Too small,25080,2
25081,Soft and small.,25081,2
25082,I liked it but it broke the first time I wore it.,25082,2
25082,One strand popped off.,25082,2
25083,Way too small and I bought the larger size.,25083,2
25083,So the sizes are way off...,25083,2
25084,"Not a full circle skirt, more like a half circle skirt, I hate it when items are described inacccurately",25084,2
25085,So cute!!!,25085,2
25085,But the back was really loose tummy fit good but the boobs were too molded.,25085,2
25085,Returned because tge back was too loose.,25085,2
25085,"(5'7"" 165lbs).",25085,2
25086,The bracelet did not stay on.,25086,2
25087,"I liked the color of the leather, but it is insanely bulky to wear!",25087,2
25087,more so than any other nato style leather strap I've ever purchased.,25087,2
25087,but hey for the money I guess I can't complain that much,25087,2
25088,Poor quality dress that was too short for me to wear to work.,25088,2
25088,I had to return,25088,2
25089,Do not enjoy the texture.,25089,2
25090,fits terribly,25090,2
25091,This suit is super cute and there are even cute little pink rhinestones on it.,25091,2
25091,Unfortunately and ultimately it has design flaws.,25091,2
25091,The top creates a look of a legitimate CONE boob.,25091,2
25091,I would not know how to manipulate the cups to flatten them out as the fabric is pretty sturdy and stiffly stuck in those positions intentionally.,25091,2
25091,I am returning the suit.,25091,2
25091,The bottoms would not be my first choice and they did not fill well either so to me this is unwearable.,25091,2
25092,The overall fit would have been fine if the torso had not been so short.,25092,2
25092,"The waist line hit my rib cage, the look was extremely unflattering.",25092,2
25093,My review is for the size 6X tshirts.,25093,2
25093,I am a big guy so i want other big men to know about these.,25093,2
25093,First they are Very thin material not heavy duty.. the neck line is thin and and does not look proportionate to the shirt it looks flimsy and unmanly.,25093,2
25093,If it was a little thicker it would look more normal.,25093,2
25093,Also because of the thin light shirt it looks bad on a big guy.,25093,2
25093,I was happy with the packing and the fast shipment.,25093,2
25093,It's just hard to find a good connection for high quality shirts in this size.,25093,2
25093,"I'm 6'2"" and the length was good but the neck had no strength and this would be a lazy at home where no one would see you type of shirt.",25093,2
25093,If you make the improvements on thickness and durability please do let me know but for now.,25093,2
25093,I would not recommend this to any tough guy types..,25093,2
25093,peace!,25093,2
25093,!,25093,2
25094,How the sizes run is unclear,25094,2
25095,"I am 5'5, 144lbs size 6-8 US, 36DD, the XL was still way too small, I don't believe this would fit anyone larger than a 4-6 size US.",25095,2
25096,Cheap fabric and patches on the elbows have a plastic feel.,25096,2
25096,Not soft.,25096,2
25096,Would not recommend.,25096,2
25097,very cheaply made.,25097,2
25098,"I'm 5'4"" 130lbs I bought this in a small expecting it to be a bit on the larger size which is fine.....",25098,2
25098,I ordered eggplant and received this awful bright purple Barney vest.,25098,2
25098,I will be sending this back not sure if I loved it enough to get a different color.,25098,2
25099,This coat was too small.,25099,2
25099,No larger size available.,25099,2
25100,They're great looking shoes but too small.,25100,2
25101,Beautiful necklace but it shipped broken so I have no choice but to return it.,25101,2
25102,"Not true to size, it was kind of small.",25102,2
25102,It seems you always have to guess at sizes.,25102,2
25102,Can't it all be standard?,25102,2
25103,I am a true 12 and ordered an XL.,25103,2
25103,Way too short/small.,25103,2
25103,Had to return.,25103,2
25104,Not what I expected.,25104,2
25105,"They are small, have a bit of magnesium and are painted gold.",25105,2
25105,"lol
I would look for magnetite crystals or polished
ones they look like iron ore.",25105,2
25106,The elastic doesn't hold it up very well.,25106,2
25106,"When you walk, it falls down.",25106,2
25107,I don't like this belt.,25107,2
25108,Broke right away.,25108,2
25108,I had to mend it twice now.,25108,2
25109,"On the plus side, this bag is as described.",25109,2
25109,"Measurements are correct and it has a nice, easy feel to it.",25109,2
25109,"I really liked it, at first.",25109,2
25109,"Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of use one of the zippers came apart.",25109,2
25109,"This was with basic use, no jerking on the zipper or over-stuffing.",25109,2
25109,I don't like a lot of stuff in my bags and I know I did not tax the zipper at all.,25109,2
25109,It simply was a flimsy zipper.,25109,2
25109,"Too bad, because the design is nice.",25109,2
25109,I am sending it back.,25109,2
25110,Poor quality,25110,2
25111,They were WAY small and the fabric felt scratchy.,25111,2
25111,I ended up returning these.,25111,2
25112,the size and the height of the shirt is disappointing,25112,2
25113,The tag says it's 95 percent cotton but it doesn't feel like it.,25113,2
25113,Other than that it's a cute top.,25113,2
25114,"Looks good, very small.",25114,2
25114,(maybe size 0-4),25114,2
25115,It was not a good quality fit.,25115,2
25116,Way to short,25116,2
25117,Got what I expected for the money,25117,2
25118,"bust area too large, dress is made for teens with cleavage",25118,2
25119,I ordered a size 12 months for Christmas and I received a 18m.,25119,2
25119,As soon as we noticed My husband ordered a size 12m and he received a 18m.,25119,2
25119,We were very disappointed.,25119,2
25119,"Otherwise, The product is very nice.",25119,2
25120,I liked the shirt but it was HUGE!,25120,2
25120,I followed the size chart and ordered a USA medium and although it's supposed to be loose fitting... a tent looks good on no one!,25120,2
25121,The shirt itself has a pretty print but the material feels like a rain jacket.,25121,2
25121,It doesn't lay right on the body and is very tight.,25121,2
25121,Mine also came with a very noticeable stain on the front.,25121,2
25121,Keep your few dollars on this Japanese mess.,25121,2
25122,Not at all like picture.,25122,2
25122,Very poor quality from China.,25122,2
25123,The fabric feels like an old curtain - it's not as flowing or as comfortable as it looks in the pictures.,25123,2
25123,"Also, it is DEFINITELY see-through.",25123,2
25123,"I would have had to wear a tank top and slip underneath it to avoid flashing people, so I just ended up returning it.",25123,2
25123,The shoulder straps also fit awkwardly and pulled the dress up too high.,25123,2
25123,"It would work as a swim-suit cover up or Halloween costume, but that's about it.",25123,2
25124,Very very very cheap looking.,25124,2
25124,But that's likely why it's so cheap in price!,25124,2
25125,"This dress us ugly, cheap and ill fitting.",25125,2
25125,"When I tried to return it, the seller urged me to keep it and give it to a friend.",25125,2
25125,What??,25125,2
25125,Finally they agreen to refund half my money and let me keep the dress so that they could avoid return shipping charges.,25125,2
25125,"I have thrown it out, it is of no use.",25125,2
25125,The material is a horrible polyester and just looks cheap.,25125,2
25125,It is too tight on the bottom as well.,25125,2
25126,The fabric is just so cheap,25126,2
25127,The product is two sizes smaller.i ordered a 2xl but it fits like and XL.,25127,2
25127,Or even a Large.,25127,2
25127,AlsoI ordered this product because it said it was printed in the USA.,25127,2
25127,The product is shipped from China.,25127,2
25127,Very disappointed in the seller I will not be purchasing from them again,25127,2
25128,Not true to size,25128,2
25129,"Very cute swimsuit however, I'm 5 2' and it was way too long.",25129,2
25130,Colors weren't the same as pictured.,25130,2
25130,Material was cheap,25130,2
25131,"It is a slim fit, I ordered a large, it seemed like a small",25131,2
25132,Hat received in bad condition; front brim totally bent in a downward position and top just about crushed,25132,2
25133,It's not worth the money.,25133,2
25133,It was not what I had expected.,25133,2
25133,I got it and it was to small and it looks cheap.,25133,2
25134,Broke the first time I wore it.,25134,2
25135,"I ordered a 36"" waist it says extra large on the label but they fit my son who has a 28"" waist.",25135,2
25135,he likes them.,25135,2
25136,"There are cute shorts, but they are at least one full size to small.",25136,2
25136,"Quality of WalMart brand shorts, so just buy at Wal Mart so you can return it you need to.",25136,2
25137,knot fell apart,25137,2
25138,Sizing is very wrong.,25138,2
25139,Looks like the picture but the material is cheap and it looks like it's part of a costume.,25139,2
25139,I can't wear it out without looking ridiculous.,25139,2
25140,"These are not real leather, they are ""pleather"" and you can even smell the chemical smell.... they look cool though but don't expect them to last, the seams will come apart.",25140,2
25141,"Was very excited for it until I tried it on, tight around my arms but loose around abdominal.",25141,2
25141,Also the zipper gets stuck!,25141,2
25142,Poo poor quality.,25142,2
25142,I received the shirt and the material is very thin and under the arm it was ripped.,25142,2
25142,I was very disappointed when I got this shirt.,25142,2
25143,it was very tight in the arm and too long...also the quality was not very good.,25143,2
25144,"cheap material, very small",25144,2
25145,I didn't like the material of the shirt.,25145,2
25146,The shirt came with a stain on the right side and it is small for the size.,25146,2
25147,Too small,25147,2
25148,Sexy but runs small.,25148,2
25148,The undies are for like a size 1 in pants.,25148,2
25148,The dress fits fine no worries with that,25148,2
25149,Described as having a zipper closure...it does not!,25149,2
25150,Loved the color but too wide.,25150,2
25151,Not quite the measurement they have listed.,25151,2
25151,Were much too small,25151,2
25152,Extremely small and cannot find a chain small enough to fit.,25152,2
25152,Glad it was only $3,25152,2
25153,The purse is lovely however it has a bad chemical smell to it so I can not use it!,25153,2
25153,It's unfortunate because I needed s big black bag to carry,25153,2
25154,To small,25154,2
25155,"The shoes were gorgeous, and my 4 year old loved the sparkle on them!",25155,2
25155,The strap was so far back on the shoe that I had to cut them off as her foot wouldnt even fit in them with it on there.,25155,2
25155,"The shoes were so small on my daughter, who wears a 9 and I ordered a 9, even tho the site suggested that the sizes ran big, but they were much much smaller than a size 9, more like and 8!",25155,2
25155,"My daughter was only able to stand them on her for about 30 minutes, which was sad because they matched her fall dress so well that we were having pictures made in them.",25155,2
25156,Too big around calves,25156,2
25157,Have only had these 2 weeks and already have 2 holes...,25157,2
25158,Cheap quality!!,25158,2
25158,"Thin, see through stretchy material.",25158,2
25159,I read the reviews and ordered a Large.,25159,2
25159,"I am a US size 6, and if I had liked the blouse at all, then I would have wanted it in a Medium, but I do not care for this, it's looks very frumpy on me.",25159,2
25159,I don't like the high V neckline or how it hangs on me.,25159,2
25159,"On the model it looks ""flowy"" but mine hangs straight out A line...kind of stiff and just not attractive - looks more like a smock!",25159,2
25159,"Since it was extremely inexpensive, I will try washing with lots of fabric softener and see if I can give to someone I work with.",25159,2
25160,Fits is too small.,25160,2
25161,"It is a really nice fabric and style, just much too small",25161,2
25162,Returned - Quality was not as expected.,25162,2
25163,The sizes run small.,25163,2
25163,"The first one I ordered was medium, couldn't zip the very bottom but the rest fit well, ordered a large.",25163,2
25163,"Got the second ordered twice as fast as the first, but the size tag was already cut off, (packaging still said Large) still fit the same but was barely able to zip the zipper this time, not sure if it was really a large or a stretched medium (because the size tag was cut off).",25163,2
25163,"The back decal is already getting wonky and bubbly, mind you I have never even worn or washed it.",25163,2
25163,"If you're buying it as a costume piece then it would be worth it, not as a semi-daily outer garmet like I was intending.",25163,2
25163,All in all I'm rather dissatisfied with the product and will not be buying from this seller again.,25163,2
25164,It was too tight on me so I would've needed to buy a bigger size.,25164,2
25165,Very cheaply made.,25165,2
25165,You get what you pay for,25165,2
25166,When I received the dress the measurements were slightly off which I measured again myself and had a seamstress measure to make sure I was doing it correctly.,25166,2
25166,The bust area had thick padding that made my chest area look squished like something was squishing it from the top and bottom.,25166,2
25166,I also thought the bottom part before it flared out would be more fitting but it wasnt.,25166,2
25166,"It's a very pretty design, but didn't fit well for a custom dress.",25166,2
25167,Does not look like the picture.,25167,2
25167,Material isn't soft.,25167,2
25167,Very short.,25167,2
25168,The shirt is much cuter in the photo...,25168,2
25168,I don't care for the material it's very thin so if your skin is super white like mine you can totally see thru the shirt :(,25168,2
25169,"Seemed like too much material below the waist, was too long.",25169,2
25170,Lens extremely flat to the point where it reflects what is behind me inside the lens.,25170,2
25170,"It is extremely distracting, especially when driving.",25170,2
25170,Two stars because they at least look ok.,25170,2
25171,3XL fits like a Medium,25171,2
25172,"Cute, but I tried it on bent over and it ripped up the side.",25172,2
25172,Not cuz I'm big but just poorly made.,25172,2
25173,Really cute shoes.,25173,2
25173,However the bow fell off on once of the shoes within an hour of my daughter playing in them.,25173,2
25173,Pretty upset.,25173,2
25173,Hoping I can glue on the bow.,25173,2
25174,"Poor quality product , bought 2 of then couldn't use them , couldn't retur them .",25174,2
25174,Lost my money .,25174,2
25175,"kind of tight on my fingers, but still wear it.",25175,2
25175,It pinches a little.,25175,2
25176,The waist is huge,25176,2
25177,The hat is super cute but did not withstand folding.,25177,2
25177,It made it one way to a vacation but did not survive two days of regular use on the beach.,25177,2
25177,Such a shame as it really is adorable!,25177,2
25177,It you aren't planning to fold or pack the hat it should work beautifully.,25177,2
25178,"This goggle is poorly designed, does not fit properly on children (target user).",25178,2
25178,"The elastic band is too short, it does not stay in place (slides down to the neck), the goggle plastic is stiff, has no flexibility to it.",25178,2
25178,Very difficult for a child to use properly.,25178,2
25179,"Too small; tighter and shorter than Dockers Athletic Quarter Socks, size 10-13.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dockers-Men-s-6-Pack-Athletic-Quarter-Socks-White-10-13-Sock-6-12-Shoe/dp/B002T04QHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dockers Men's 6 Pack Athletic Quarter Socks, White, 10-13 Sock/6-12 Shoe</a>",25179,2

25181,I wouldn't buy this item I don't recommend it.,25181,2
25181,It turned rusty and had a smell to it.,25181,2
25181,Very disappointing!,25181,2
25182,It is not nearly as full as pictured.,25182,2
25182,Fine for hippy boho but if you are looking to do a lot of dancing and flipping the skirt this isn't it.,25182,2
25182,Break down spend a little more and get 12 yard skirts.,25182,2
25182,Just want a comfy modesty dress this is great.,25182,2
25182,It is also a polyester knit fabric not a woven cotton.,25182,2
25183,I just didn't like the fit or style.,25183,2
25183,It looked cuter in pictures than it looked in person.,25183,2
25183,The company was a big pain in the rear to deal with.,25183,2
25184,"Normally the products I buy from Amazon are quite good and while the quality seems reasonable, I cannot understand why when I place these XXL shirts up against my medium shirt they're a nearly perfect match.",25184,2
25184,Why not just call this medium?,25184,2
25185,"Thin and runs on the small side and nothing bigger than an XL :(
Gave them to my daughter who wears a medium.",25185,2
25186,Bad fabric,25186,2
25187,They are really small.,25187,2
25187,"They don't lay like photo shows, the lace sticks straight out to the side making it look more like it belongs on a little girl's ankle socks.",25187,2
25187,I haven never worn them out of my house.,25187,2
25187,There are more expensive versions that are a much better allocation of money.,25187,2
25188,"Fits as expected, cheap material it ripped the same day I wore it.",25188,2
25188,Cute dress just don't expect to wear it more than once.,25188,2
25189,"This item is very pretty, however, caused major ear infections even after cleaning them prior to insertion.",25189,2
25189,too big for septum and too big for tragus.,25189,2
25189,I was a little sad about this purchase.,25189,2
25190,I used the size chart listed and purchased an XXS.,25190,2
25190,I'm usually between a 0 and 2 and I couldn't even get these past my thighs.,25190,2
25190,"Other than that, they're great quality.",25190,2
25191,These pants were way to short and baggy in the thigh area.,25191,2
25191,Disappointed.,25191,2
25192,It runs very small.,25192,2
25192,I am a size 2 and the small was super tight!,25192,2
25192,Returned it!,25192,2
25193,"Wow...first off, it's a fairly well made hoodie, BUT, it would never sell for $49.99!",25193,2
25193,For $19.99 it's a decent price but runs very small...I would say you show order it at least two sizes bigger than normal.,25193,2
25194,I was going to return this product but shipping to China is too much effort.,25194,2
25194,"I'll just resell it on another app, but wanted to make sure I provided a review so people knew what they were purchasing.",25194,2
25194,"The top, fits, but the bottom elastic doesn't hold very well, which exposes boob.",25194,2
25194,I'd be afraid it would lift up.,25194,2
25194,"The bottoms are cute and actually fit, I'm planning to keep those and trying to incorporate them with maybe a solid colored top.",25194,2
25194,Pictures posted.,25194,2
25194,I ordered a large and for reference I'm usually a size 4 or 6.,25194,2
25194,"I am 5'9"" and 130 lbs.",25194,2
25194,I usually order a large in VS tops and a Med in their bottoms.,25194,2
25194,Good luck!,25194,2
25195,This product was not hemmed correctly and the material is fairly sheer.,25195,2
25195,It doesn't look nearly as classy as the picture.,25195,2
25196,Poor clips let go too easily.,25196,2
25197,"I would have given full star, if the jumpsuit didn't fit so small.",25197,2
25197,I couldn't even pull it up my shoulder.,25197,2
25197,"The material isn't bad for the prize, but the size is not true to fit.",25197,2
25198,"They look great, but they are way too small for me to put on (I'm a 9.5 in most shoes, with slightly narrow feet).",25198,2
25198,"I gave them to my wife, and even she had a hard time getting them on (since the art portion around the ankle doesn't stretch), but once she did, she said they fit her perfectly.",25198,2
25198,"""These are not mens socks"" she said.",25198,2
25199,way to small  gave to daughter  see like it,25199,2
25200,Very pretty except only two dandelion seeds in globe.,25200,2
25200,"Very easy to miss, looks almost empty..",25200,2
25201,"The shirt is made of very thin material, it will be used in the winter.",25201,2
25201,It was a gift.,25201,2
25202,"One star because they fall down after a few steps of walking, but gave it the extra star since they are somewhat warm.",25202,2
25202,"They are cute, but I would have lined the inside by the buttons because legs get cold in between.",25202,2
25202,The main problem is that they fall down after just a few steps of walking so I'm constantly yanking them back up.,25202,2
25202,Very annoying.,25202,2
25202,They should have done something different at the top to hold them up.,25202,2
25202,Now I need to search for a better pair that stays up.,25202,2
25202,Disappointing.,25202,2
25203,"These look pretty cool, but they are cheaply made.",25203,2
25203,The metal is thin and bends.,25203,2
25203,"These are not the best quality, but work for a party or Burning Man",25203,2
25204,Buy 2 sizes larger,25204,2

25205,but quality is fine,25205,2
25206,The gems r falling out.,25206,2
25207,"Cheap material, looks horrible.",25207,2

25209,Ok quality.,25209,2
25209,Would never use this company again!,25209,2
25210,No stretch,25210,2
25211,Horrible quality,25211,2
25212,"Although the picture made it seem as if this were a good quality, it is actually very cheaply made and is extremely small.",25212,2
25212,Was hoping for a more luxurious product.,25212,2
25213,"This dress would be great if the ""gold necklace"" that holds it up didn't attack every strand of hair on my head/neck!",25213,2
25213,"I was excited to receive this dress, hoping I could wear it to an upcoming wedding, so as soon it arrived I rushed to my room to try it on... but OUCH!",25213,2
25213,The slinky-esque necklace literally pulled at every hair and I couldn't go through with trying it on... it just hurt too much!,25213,2
25213,"I bought the dress in two colors, but I'll be returning both, as they are too painful to wear...",25213,2
25213,"Which is a shame, because they are beautiful dresses!",25213,2
25214,for what I paid for it.,25214,2
25214,I expected it to work.,25214,2
25214,See no difference in the times used on shoes/boots.,25214,2
25214,would not recommend.,25214,2
25215,I guess you get what is expected for the price- too many flaws in the material.,25215,2
25216,Size is not true.,25216,2
25216,Very small.,25216,2
25217,"love patty boutik, but not this dress.",25217,2
25217,one sleeve was way tighter and two inches longer than the other sleeve.,25217,2
25217,poor quality.,25217,2
25218,The product did fit true to size but was way too short.,25218,2
25218,"It barely came below my knees and I'm 5'8"".",25218,2
25218,I wanted it to be long like the picture.,25218,2
25219,"not as expected, material too light",25219,2
25220,Very cheap/Claire's looking.,25220,2
25220,Quite disappointed,25220,2
25221,The coat is not the blue jean color as shown in the picture.,25221,2
25221,Its a much lighter color.,25221,2
25222,its way way too small.,25222,2
25222,I need to return when I find a millisecond,25222,2
25223,Thought it was heather red gray but instead it turns out being just light gray,25223,2
25224,Poor quality.,25224,2
25225,Shoes came used and size are not relaliable,25225,2
25226,one of the clips stopped grabbing onto cloth after one use so now i cant use it anymore.,25226,2
25227,It look like a night gown.,25227,2
25228,it was too big for a man gave it to my wife it ripped across the seam .,25228,2
25229,My suit arrived damaged.,25229,2
25229,The inside lining seam was unraveling making a large hole.,25229,2
25229,I had to return for that reason.,25229,2
25229,It was a cute suit though.,25229,2
25229,It ran a little small.,25229,2
25229,"My only complaint about the look of the suit is super OCD of me, but let me explain by saying that the parts of the suit that were print had off-white and cream colors in it which I really liked; the issue was that the blue and red colored stripes that go around under the bust matched the print but the third stripe was true white (not off white or cream) which didn't match the print at all (that's a deal breaker for me).",25229,2
25229,"It sounds crazy, I know, but little things like that really bother me...",25229,2
25230,"Oops, didn't see that it was asian-made with likewise sizes.",25230,2
25230,These are not standard American or European sizes at all.,25230,2
25230,"Much, much smaller!",25230,2
25230,I'm guessing XL is more like US Medium.,25230,2
25230,"But, it may be best to just purchase from a retailer that has sizes you can trust.",25230,2
25230,It won't be worth the cost to return the item to China.,25230,2
25231,Cheaply made.,25231,2
25231,Loop broke second time worn.,25231,2
25232,I ordered size small.,25232,2
25232,But these kept falling off.,25232,2
25232,I washed them and they shrunk a little.,25232,2
25232,So hopefully will not fit that big.,25232,2
25232,Otherwise I like the product.,25232,2
25232,I ordered several colors.,25232,2
25233,Couldn't even get your foot in some of the socks.,25233,2
25233,It's like the tops were sewn shut.,25233,2
25234,Had this ring two weeks and it fell apart.,25234,2
25234,The ring is quite attractive but the finish doesn't stay shiny.,25234,2
25235,"Ordered XL and fits like a snug medium, love everything else, just too small",25235,2
25236,"Not what it looks like in picture, very costume like fabric.",25236,2
25236,"Size fits well, but not what I was expecting.",25236,2
25236,Not worth it.,25236,2
25237,"Seller was very nice kept in contact with me shipping was fast but the dress was poorly sewn together, a line of ruffles was hanging off in the front of the dress at the top where the bubbles are on the side material was just hanging there was not attached had to the cleaners to get fixed that was even more money",25237,2
25238,Ordered white gloves.,25238,2
25238,"Package is marked white, but gloves are beige at best.",25238,2
25238,They fit nice but they aren't the color I ordered.,25238,2
25239,Shows too much under boob.,25239,2
25239,And my boobs aren't even big.,25239,2
25240,It looks really nice and it fits nicely but it was ripped on the side when it arrived in the mail.,25240,2
25241,Very small not even close to a large,25241,2
25242,I'm a bit disappointed in these leggings.,25242,2
25242,"They are supposed to be plus sized, but they definitely do not fit like other plus sized leggings do.",25242,2
25242,"I wear a size 18 pants, and when I put these on, I snapped the seam thread in the bottoms of both legs and one line in the waist.",25242,2
25242,"I do have big calves, but I was still sad that this happened.",25242,2
25242,"I took the thread out of the bottoms and just wear them 'unfinished,' but I wish they weren't sewn so tight in the first place.",25242,2
25242,"The thread is a little thin, it wasn't difficult to snap it by just pulling it between two hands.",25242,2
25242,"They are a little tight everywhere, and as such I get a small ""muffin top"" around the waist.",25242,2
25242,"I am a pear-shaped person, and usually that's not something I have a problem with.",25242,2
25242,"The print is cute, and I did get compliments when I wore them.",25242,2
25242,If I hadn't snapped the thread I would have sent them back.,25242,2
25242,Not so great for the self-esteem :(.,25242,2
25243,"Don't like it, too thin and short.",25243,2
25244,Seems like good quality but wayyyyy too big,25244,2
25245,Very pretty dress but runs small.,25245,2
25245,Order 1-2 sizes larger.,25245,2
25246,The item says its white but it is actually ivory.,25246,2
25246,I will keep it because its nice and not worth hassle of a return but its not what I ordered.,25246,2
25247,I feel like these jammies were made for babies that are a little on the chubbier/snugglier side.,25247,2
25247,"My little guy is tall, but lean.",25247,2
25247,These fit him in length but were very baggy.,25247,2
25247,And the elastic around the ankle was really loose so he could pull his feet out easily.,25247,2
25247,I stopped using these when I found him in the morning with both knees tucked up inside the pajamas because he pulled his feet out.,25247,2
25248,Had to return it because it did not fit as the picture and the top ran too small.,25248,2
25249,Was ripped at sleeve when it arrived.,25249,2
25249,"Really like the color, so I repaired it myself.",25249,2
25249,Wish it was better quality.,25249,2
25250,way too small!,25250,2
25250,"even an extra large, was tiny!",25250,2
25251,"Purchased a XXL, for myself, and it was way too small, more like an adult medium.",25251,2
25251,"I did give it to my niece, as she is a small teenager and it fit her.",25251,2
25251,She loved it.,25251,2
25252,Material has a slippery nylon feel.,25252,2
25252,Doesn't seem like it would be good over a bathing suit.,25252,2
25252,Feels and looks like lingerie.,25252,2
25253,the point of wool si to separate.,25253,2
25254,Very disappointed!,25254,2
25254,Pocket is black not navy blue.,25254,2
25255,Much shorter than photographed and gathered at each seam.,25255,2
25255,Not great quality,25255,2
25256,Came in time for my show but the material was dumb fitting,25256,2
25257,I like this... it's light weight and exactly what I was looking for.,25257,2
25257,The problem is it's very small.,25257,2
25257,I ordered a size bigger than what I usually wear and it's still on the snug side.,25257,2
25258,Cute dress but a entire section was not sewn together??,25258,2
25258,Don't know what's up with that.,25258,2
25258,I'm bummed,25258,2
25259,Strap broken almost immediately,25259,2
25260,I wanted to wait until I had used this produce for awhile to review.,25260,2
25260,"Well, I've used it for 2 months now and I have to say it works fairly well.",25260,2
25260,"The low rating is because the product quality did not meet expectations.. first, after only 2 weeks of wear it started rolling down then shortly after the inside elastic bunched up and stays that way all the time which is very annoying.",25260,2
25260,Uncomfortable and annoying yet it worked so if you want to struggle with it for results you will get them.,25260,2
25261,Got tangled and won't lay flat.,25261,2
25261,Nice color but since it won't lay flat I don't like wearing it.,25261,2
25262,"very small , i ordered a large",25262,2
25263,"the owl on my shirt came in a different color, instead of brown it is yellow.",25263,2
25263,The shirt feels comfy but also again with looks isn't of a batwing style.,25263,2
25264,Top is way to big.,25264,2
25264,Fabric is defective.,25264,2
25264,Splotchy and faded.,25264,2
25264,Cheaply made.,25264,2
25264,My daughter was so excited when it arrived; but has quickly been disappointed.,25264,2
25264,Am returning it and will look for something else to get.,25264,2
25265,"After the first wash the dress was very short, it was like a T-shirt",25265,2
25266,"The top was very itchy, the dress was extremely long (I am 5'3""), and the top was too big.",25266,2
25266,"Also, it would have cost more to alter than the dress was worth.",25266,2
25267,super soft but didn't come in the color I wanted.,25267,2
25267,I asked for the light pink but instead I got a hot pink one,25267,2
25268,"Pants are too thin & long, disproportionate  to size ordered",25268,2
25269,"Item was WAY too small - my girlfriend normally wears a size S, I ordered a M - and what we received fits like an XS.",25269,2
25269,The torso is tight and the arms aren't long enough.,25269,2
25270,These shoes fit well and are super cute BUT they are not high quality.,25270,2
25270,The bows fell off the first day my daughter wore them.,25270,2
25271,The silver bit in the center fell out of one of the plugs before I even got a chance to wear them.,25271,2
25271,Other than that they're a good solid pair of plugs.,25271,2
25271,Just wish they were better made.,25271,2
25272,See through bottoms and super tight chest.,25272,2
25272,I am 100 lbs 5'4.,25272,2
25272,I ordered a small.,25272,2
25272,Shouldn't have been a problem fitting me.,25272,2
25273,design on shirt doesn't look AT ALL like the picture.,25273,2
25273,"very low quality, logo is cut off on the side.",25273,2
25273,wouldn't buy again.,25273,2
25273,fits ok though.,25273,2
25274,I usually wear us xl.,25274,2
25274,"This plus size is too small, it doesn't fit me at all.",25274,2
25275,"was too heavy, did not look nice for the occation",25275,2
25276,"The lower part of this dress fit great, the arms and shoulder area was too small.",25276,2
25276,"Upon looking at the dress closer, the hems where the sleeves attach appeared to have been stretched.",25276,2
25277,Very dainty and pretty costume jewelry.,25277,2
25277,"It tarnished very quickly, less than a year.",25277,2
25278,My breasts are pretty large (40DD) but I don't really care if they bounce around a bit.,25278,2
25278,"So when I bought this, I was not looking for a lot of support.",25278,2
25278,"So it's pretty, but it's also pretty much a useless piece of fabric.",25278,2
25278,"It falls down too much to ever wear it in public, so I'm not really sure what I'm going to use it for.",25278,2
25279,Calidad regular,25279,2
25280,Wearing a pair for only the third time and notices I already have a hole in the heel...!,25280,2
25280,(I guess you get what you pay for),25280,2
25281,It is a beautiful cost but I am returning it.,25281,2
25281,Very small and the zipper does not work.,25281,2
25281,Sad because it is beautiful.,25281,2
25282,"I was hoping this would have a cottony soft feel, but it is a shiny polyester and way too hot for summer time or any other hot climate",25282,2
25283,Too small even though I ordered 2 sizes too big,25283,2
25284,Reviews stated that this suit was great for someone with a long torso and a large behind.,25284,2
25284,I strongly disagree.,25284,2
25284,There was not enough material to cover my behind.,25284,2
25284,Typically my cheeks are fairly  exposed in most bathing suits but this suit didn't even cover my entire crack.,25284,2
25284,Nor was it long enough to fit properly on top.,25284,2
25285,The jacket wasn't what I expected.,25285,2
25285,Fits like a mid-drift top.,25285,2
25285,Smelled horrible so I washed it.....when it came out of the dryer there were pieces of thread hanging everywhere.,25285,2
25285,Arms were a good length.,25285,2
25286,"This dress doesn't fix properly,I didn't like how the dress fits.",25286,2
25287,"The tank top was too big; the tutu fit perfect but it was too poofy and the stockings were wayyyy too small, I couldn't get them over my butt!",25287,2
25287,Very cheap costume & I wouldn't recommend it.,25287,2
25287,I ended up sending it back for a refund.,25287,2
25288,I got the size I thought I needed and I can't close it sufficiently to cover my body so I haven't used it.,25288,2
25288,Hoping if I lose weight I will eventually be able to use it.,25288,2
25289,Amazon's sizing chart is way off!,25289,2
25289,"I bought this for my Mom and while I expected the robe to be long since she is 5'4"" the whole set is way too big!",25289,2
25289,"The 2x label says 26/28 and my Mom, for comfort in sleepwear would wear about size 18 which is what Amazon has 2x at!",25289,2
25289,"I measured the hip and it's 65"".",25289,2
25289,This will have to go as a gift for a relative who is around this size!,25289,2
25289,"Judging by this sizing, I'm guessing my Mom would be a large instead.",25289,2
25290,Daughter loved it but had it for two weeks and then necklace fell apart.,25290,2
25291,Not comfortable and runs very small.,25291,2
25292,I was so excited to receive this bathing suit.,25292,2
25292,I checked the side chart and concluded that I need to get an XL.,25292,2
25292,When I was trying it on I notice that it somewhat was going as smooth as I would want.,25292,2
25292,For my surprise it didn't even make it to my shoulders.,25292,2
25292,This bathing suits seem to be made for XXXS petite ppl.,25292,2
25292,Was really upset because I love it love the colors the style.,25292,2
25292,So bad that it was not made for regular size ppl,25292,2
25293,Very see through.,25293,2
25293,Otherwise cute.,25293,2
25294,This body chain was cute until I wore it for an event and the chain snapped within an hour.,25294,2
25294,Once a link breaks you cannot fix it.,25294,2
25294,It does look cute but if you are planning on wearing it to the club or anywhere that involves a lot of moving DO NOT BUY.,25294,2
25294,"However, if you plan on wearing it to the beach or poolside laying out then that would be fine.",25294,2
25294,I would just save your time and spend the extra $5 to get a body chain from Forever 21 or something.,25294,2
25295,Top was EXTREMELY hard to put on.,25295,2
25295,No snap or tieing strings in back.,25295,2
25295,You have to pull it over your head.,25295,2
25295,Odd shape for the breasts.,25295,2
25296,Looked very cheap.,25296,2
25296,I returned the item.,25296,2
25297,nice but didn't fit as expected,25297,2
25298,I have many of the 90 degree leggings however these are my least favorite.,25298,2
25298,The waist is tight and very very high.,25298,2
25298,I love the tummy control capris but these are awkward.,25298,2
25299,I received a different shirt than pictured.,25299,2
25300,Way too big.,25300,2
25300,It looks more like Shrek than Yoda.,25300,2
25301,The clasp broke.,25301,2
25301,As pretty as it is it's not an item that should be bought,25301,2
25302,"Look great,but the cross separate the second day ,have to perfectioner.",25302,2
25303,Too big,25303,2
25304,"Nice hat, but.... WOW!",25304,2
25304,This thing is freakishly huge.,25304,2
25304,I measured approx.,25304,2
25304,"26"" circumference with velcro tab on back at default setting!",25304,2
25304,"I like the denim and look, but had to return because my XL (7-3/4) head just ain't big enough!",25304,2
25305,"small and quality is crap, but that's expected for the $",25305,2
25306,The bottoms are almost see through and the stitching wasn't the best.,25306,2
25306,I did like the color....just wish the material wasn't so thin.,25306,2
25307,"Purchased one similar and from reviews was told to order a size larger than normal (I wear medium, bought in large).",25307,2
25307,Thought it was cute so ordered this one (large) -- it was way too tight and fabric was thinner.,25307,2
25307,I gave it away!!,25307,2
25307,!,25307,2
25308,"It's a cute sweater, but I have only ever worn it around the house...it is not what is pictured on the photo.",25308,2
25308,"Photo is WAY cuter, but it is a cozy little thing to throw on while lounging around the house in yoga pants and a Cami...I didn't return it bc it's comfortable even though it's my what the photo shows.",25308,2
25308,A very loose crochet-like material.,25308,2
25309,"I have ordered a white shirt but I receive an ivory instead, also I have ordered a small and I received a Medium.",25309,2
25310,"Very pretty necklace, fast shipping, but fell apart after wearing only twice.",25310,2
25311,Fits small in the shoulders,25311,2
25312,Cheapish.,25312,2
25312,Wouldn't recommend,25312,2
25313,"The dress came rather quickly, was very similar to the picture but was very thin.",25313,2
25313,The belt strap and neck strap were so thin like a ribbon on a gift.,25313,2
25313,"The dress was also big across the breast area, offering no support and was longer than appeared in the picture.",25313,2
25313,I purchased this dress for my daughter who is 5'9 about 145lbs.,25313,2
25313,I purchased a medium and it was too long.,25313,2
25313,It just seemed cheaply made.,25313,2
25314,Does not strech,25314,2
25315,I didn't like the material,25315,2
25316,Returned to seller for refund.,25316,2
25317,This product is worth about $2.,25317,2
25317,Far overpriced for what it is.,25317,2
25318,"I have a pair of these that are allegedly the same size, but these ones are at least a full size bigger.",25318,2
25318,"Obnoxious that the sizes have changed so much, especially for someone with very small feet.",25318,2
25318,I have enough trouble finding shoes that fit without dealing with insane variations in actual sizes.,25318,2
25319,"Pros:
- Thick material.",25319,2
25319,This is really all the glove had going for me.,25319,2
25319,"Cons:
- Super hard and annoying to squeeze baby's hands into glove.",25319,2
25319,"With all the stress (and love) that comes about in caring for an infant, I don't need the additional stress that is required for putting on these mittens.",25319,2
25319,I bought the largest size available (Medium-Large) for a 5 month old baby in the 50th percentile for weight/height.,25319,2
25319,Baby's hand's aren't large but the rim of the gloves do not stretch enough to allow hands to easily go in.,25319,2
25319,The rim barely stretches.,25319,2
25319,"(See my next point)
- The velcro strap is pretty much pointless.",25319,2
25319,"As previously mentioned, the rim barely stretches and is already pretty tight requiring me to squeeze my baby's hand into it, so what is the point of the velcro strap?",25319,2
25319,It looks nice for sure.,25319,2
25319,"- Multiple reviewers have also mentioned this but once you wash it, the velcro strap sorta sticks out at the end.",25319,2
25319,The velcro at the end is going to scratch your baby's face and cause more rashes.,25319,2
25319,- Doesn't dry fast enough.,25319,2
25319,Stays soggy quite a bit.,25319,2
25319,Soggy mittens + Rubbing on face ==> Recipe for rashes.,25319,2
25319,"Summary:
We were initially using these cheap thin mittens on our baby's hands and our baby's nails could claw through the material.",25319,2
25319,These obviously help quite a bit in stopping those scratches due to the much thicker material.,25319,2
25319,But our baby also chews and sucks on his hands and these mittens get soggy and don't try up quick enough.,25319,2
25319,"Overall, these gloves did not work out for us.",25319,2
25319,"It might work out for others whose baby's hands are much smaller, don't mind the sogginess or velcro-scratching baby's face.",25319,2
25319,It definitely was not worth the price we paid for one single glove.,25319,2
25319,"Ended up buying some cheaper GAP winter fleece mittens (check Ebay, couldn't find them on Amazon, and Gap site was out of stock) that were much larger, fits easily, and dries up quickly.",25319,2
25320,I ordered an extra large after reading previous reviews.,25320,2
25320,They are still too tight.,25320,2
25320,I typically wear a medium so I'm a bit disappointed.,25320,2
25320,Not sending them back in the hopes that I will be able to fit in then in the near future if I continue my workout program.,25320,2
25321,Pattern does not look like the picture.,25321,2
25321,"Whoever sewed the hat I received was not trying to make the patter look good, most of the graphics are up-side-down, and I was expected the bottom half to be a different pattern than the top half, as it is pictures, but it isn't, it's all randomly stitched, nothing's straight, and it's frustrating.",25321,2
25322,This item is only getting 2 stars from me because I find the top is much larger in comparison to the bottom.,25322,2
25322,It seems that they just don't go together.,25322,2
25323,Item was shorter than expected.,25323,2
25323,Unable to use and had to return.,25323,2
25324,Awful costume fit...,25324,2
25325,It took forever to arrive.,25325,2
25325,I thought it was acrylic but it's not.,25325,2
25325,"It's made out of cheap plastic and it arrived chipped on the back but then again, you get what you pay for.",25325,2
25326,"Cuffs are not tight like shown in the picture, so it isn't really as it's shown.",25326,2
25326,"Would not have bought if I knew, false advertising!",25326,2
25327,The material does not stretch as you would think it does.,25327,2
25327,Really love the style and wanted it to fit but it doesn't and now I'm stuck with it.,25327,2
25328,Stinks like a halloween mask.,25328,2
25328,"There's no snaps to snap the collar to the jacket, it's incredibly squeaky.",25328,2
25329,I gave it two stars because it is a pretty dress but I ordered a size 6 for my daughter and it was huge!,25329,2
25329,Very disappointed with that.,25329,2
25329,It is not true to size.,25329,2
25330,Not true to size at all.,25330,2
25330,Had to return the item,25330,2
25331,"It is nice quality, thick material, however it  is not oversized and fits my head like a regular cap.",25331,2
25331,Very disappointed.,25331,2
25332,They look great but they leave marks on your nose which is expected from inexpensive glasses,25332,2
25333,These run very small.,25333,2
25333,Order a size larger.,25333,2
25334,Don't buy it's not the same as shown in picture.,25334,2
25335,I bought this because I like the style and it's difficult to find for some reason.,25335,2
25335,The design of the buckle saves the belt from the wear and tear of a traditional pin as you're not concentrating a bend in the same spot over and over again.,25335,2
25335,"Unfortunately, the belt came wrapped so tight around the buckle that the leather was already creased and ruined.",25335,2
25335,It would have been a very nice belt otherwise.,25335,2
25335,I'll save the buckle and use it on another belt.,25335,2
25336,looks cheap.,25336,2
25336,Also the design around the bottom stone has little tiny fake diamonds.,25336,2
25336,I thought it was just silver so it looks really cheap.,25336,2
25337,Waist was only thing that fit.,25337,2
25337,"But, thighs, crotch area were a deff no go.",25337,2
25337,They were well made.,25337,2
25337,I returned them at a 50% loss.,25337,2
25337,Never again.,25337,2
25338,"I understand that yoga related items are meant to fit closely to the body, but I ordered a XXL to be baggy......it's snug and I'm a M in ""normal"" tops",25338,2
25339,I got a big size (2x) to get it long and it was just wider i was so sad because its so cute!,25339,2
25339,!,25339,2
25340,Tinier than even they appear in the picture.,25340,2
25340,"If you want to just have something in your pierced ear to keep it open, great, but don't expect to use them for any kind of a particular style/look, not enough there and a magnifying glass is needed to see the word LOVE.",25340,2
25341,My boy will turn 4 and the tshirt fits too large.,25341,2
25341,"Also it says it was a 100% cotton tshirt and its not true, its 90% cotton 10% polyester.",25341,2
25342,I got my my purse September 9 and it's already tearing up and coming apart.,25342,2
25343,The padding was kindda strange and the large was way too big for a 34D.,25343,2
25344,These run VERY small.,25344,2
25344,The XL was more like a medium.,25344,2
25344,"The fabric is the kind of fabric that will pill easily, and won't look nice long.",25344,2
25344,Also the elastic in the waist band was way to small for the waist and causing it to bunch up.,25344,2
25344,Also they had an awful chemical smell as I took them out of the cellophane bag.,25344,2
25344,"I would not be able to recocend these to anyone, even if they're only $8.",25344,2
25345,These are not very low cut.,25345,2
25345,i was expecting a lower profile sock.,25345,2
25345,these sit too high outside my shoes.,25345,2
25346,This costume is not what I received.,25346,2
25346,The costume that I received is gold and black instead of white and black.,25346,2
25346,And it's a leotard with garter straps and 2 thigh highs to connect to the straps.,25346,2
25346,The costume is also not a v neck like the picture.,25346,2
25346,I wanted a full body suit like the picture.,25346,2
25346,This is all wrong.,25346,2
25347,Not very happy with the pants.,25347,2
25347,The material feels cheap and they run long.,25347,2
25347,Honestly not worth $30.,25347,2
25348,Although the hats were well constructed they ship them folded length ways and flat.,25348,2
25348,So try as I might to get the creases out and their proper shape back it's just not working.,25348,2
25348,I tried steaming the front brim which is obviously the most noticeable crease and can't get it out.,25348,2
25348,So it doesn't have the smooth flow it shows in pictures.,25348,2
25348,For me that's an issue since I bought them to be worn in this year's easter photos.,25348,2
25349,As expected,25349,2
25350,This dress is see thriugh.,25350,2
25350,The fabric is thin and very poor quality.,25350,2
25351,I ordered a size bigger than I am and it fit snug with a blouse under it.,25351,2
25351,I sent it back.,25351,2
25352,I am a size 12 and ordered in a Large.,25352,2
25352,"The dress was very tight, and the champagne color was very see through.",25352,2
25352,"It could be a decent dress in the right size and with a slip, but for me it wasn't worth the hassle.",25352,2
25353,Ehhh is all I can say.,25353,2
25353,The bottom was nice but the top was nothing like the picture.,25353,2
25353,I'm a 38dd and to say the least I was not supported,25353,2
25354,The dress is cute however the red dye has stained by sweater.,25354,2
25354,Wash separately from other items.,25354,2
25355,"Beautiful product, just not true to size.",25355,2
25356,Very pretty but way too small.,25356,2
25356,Fits my 9 year old but too tight on my small wrist.,25356,2
25356,Will not work for me to make a corsage for my sons homecoming date.,25356,2
25357,"Way small, I ordered a Large.",25357,2
25357,"This is a belly shirt, I thought it would be longer.",25357,2
25357,It looks nothing like the picture,25357,2
25358,These are huge!,25358,2
25358,Way too large for my face.,25358,2
25359,Runs small and were made from uncomfortable material.,25359,2
25360,"Love fleece and the length as I am 5'10"" and 130 lbs.",25360,2
25360,The issue is they fight tight on the thigh and even with my height I have to keep them pulled up to almost chest level.,25360,2
25360,They have a very long crouch and it is impossible to  get them to fist right in the crouch area.,25360,2
25360,I am constantly pulling them up.,25360,2
25360,I do not recommend these to anyone.,25360,2
25361,My iPhone 6 Plus falls out of this case.,25361,2
25361,The case is a few centimeters too big.,25361,2
25362,Too small,25362,2
25363,Arrived smashed and unusable.,25363,2
25363,Arrived 3 months after ordered.,25363,2
25363,The seller shipped in an unpadded bag with no packing material.,25363,2
25363,"The stone will not change colors unless you touch the stone itself, meaning it will not detect your mood just buy wearing it because the under surface is solid metal, not stone.",25363,2
25363,It arrived completely bent; we tried to bend it back and the ring detached from the turtle... we will try to Crazy Glue it.,25363,2
25364,Returned these.,25364,2
25364,EXTREMELY long,25364,2
25365,The shirt overall is nice but it is skin tight on me.,25365,2
25365,"probably wouldn't order again, you more or less need to have the models body for this shirt.",25365,2
25366,"Its a cute dress and all but it runs a bit small and the skirt part is way cheap material, but i do like it, she'll get atleast two wears in this dress till it stops fitting so definitely size up mommas",25366,2
25367,The front of the frame is half black.,25367,2
25367,I ordered brown.,25367,2
25367,It doesnt look like it did in the picture.,25367,2
25368,"Too small, not stretchy.",25368,2
25369,Way too large.,25369,2
25369,Size chart says they run small.,25369,2
25369,Not as good of quality as I would've expected either.,25369,2
25370,After a few days of wearing the bars were causing irritation and coloring was rubbing off of the trident end showing brassy color.,25370,2
25370,I disinfected them with barbicide and they still irritated the nipple.,25370,2
25370,Not happy about this jewelry.,25370,2
25371,"This shirt fit me perfectly upon arrival, I washed it once per directions it  shrunk down and now it constantly rolls up to just about my belly button, I keep having to pull it down.",25371,2
25371,If you considering buying it pick 1-2 extra size up.,25371,2
25372,Even after sending my exact measurements the dress was still too large.,25372,2
25373,The ring I received had a visable defect in the surface...a void in the outer layer of the material.,25373,2
25373,"Other than that, it fit well size wise and had the appearance of a nice bright white metal.",25373,2
25373,"Because of the void in the surface, I returned it, as there is no way to repair it.",25373,2
25374,This item seems to run a little small for the size it is suppose to be.,25374,2
25375,Very hard to put on,25375,2
25376,I was expecting something else.,25376,2
25376,The fit is small and when it is worn for a few minutes after awhile it stretches out while you're moving around.,25376,2
25376,Would not recommend this to anyone.,25376,2
25377,To small.,25377,2
25377,Had to give it away,25377,2
25378,I've never seen a smaller XL.,25378,2
25378,"I'll wear it, but I look like a stuffed sausage for sure.",25378,2
25379,The material is very thin and not a good quality.,25379,2
25379,"From a distance, it looks OK, but the person wearing it can sure tell that the quality is not good.",25379,2
25379,"I'm almost afraid to wash it, in case it falls apart in the wash.",25379,2
25380,It's ok for the price but it started falling apart after a few months.,25380,2
25381,Small,25381,2
25382,Not correct case It said it fit iPhone 6/6S,25382,2
25383,The packaging was so small it looked like a letter.,25383,2
25384,"It's a beautiful necklace, with extraordinary detail, but I ordered this in early June, and it's coming in mid August.",25384,2
25384,Very upset.,25384,2
25385,"According to the size chart on the back, I should have been fine, but these were way too small.",25385,2
25385,Don't bother unless you're well below the max weight.,25385,2
25386,"I really liked the design of the ring and the stone, but felt like it was pretty cheap quality, especially for the price.",25386,2
25386,"The silver was already tarnished, and the band was so flimsy and thin, it felt like it would easily break.",25386,2
25387,"I was so bummed that the xl was so small
I would've only been able to wear it one time.",25387,2
25388,This seemed to shrink after the first wash.,25388,2
25388,"This would probably still fit an Athletic build body type, but for someone with just a couple more lbs, it's a bit tight",25388,2
25389,NOT TRUE TO US SIZE AT ALL!,25389,2
25389,"Which I usually plan for but this had a ""new size chart because of all the complaints"" and said US sizing.",25389,2
25389,So i went with the chart and its terribly wrong.,25389,2
25390,"Great quality warm socks, but definitely NOT long.",25390,2
25390,"They end about 6"" from my knees - midway up my calf.",25390,2
25390,"I'm 5'9"".",25390,2
25391,Never again with the chinese sizes.,25391,2
25391,You have to be petit and slim to look like the model in the picture.,25391,2
25392,A good concept.,25392,2
25392,Poor quality.,25392,2
25392,Will return.,25392,2
25393,Very short ....sewing very flimsy .ordered the large n the breast part was very small,25393,2
25394,"Fits very, very small.",25394,2
25395,"Runs small, but well made.",25395,2
25395,Order next largest size.,25395,2
25396,"This ring is huge, I can't wear it because it hangs on my upper lip which is a shame because it's very cute.",25396,2
25396,"But if you have a small nose, I can't recommend it.",25396,2
25397,it is way to small.,25397,2
25397,I would like to return it.,25397,2
25398,3 year old just took them off jacket on first day.,25398,2
25398,Great idea and quality was fine didn't work out for us.,25398,2
25399,You get what you pay for... Love the romper in general but WAY TOO SHORT.,25399,2
25399,I'm 5'4 and 135 and my butt is pretty much hanging out,25399,2
25400,"like design ,but need to return due to size and very thin material.",25400,2
25401,was to baggy on me,25401,2
25402,Big wallet too fluffy for subtle back pocket,25402,2
25403,The length is mostly what I was interested in and in that respect it is satisfactory.,25403,2
25403,"However, the garment has no body since there is no lining which was also known at the time and I am addressing that by having it altered.",25403,2
25403,"When I took it to my alteration lady, she pointed out how poorly made it was and how many mistakes in sewing were made.",25403,2
25403,It was hard to see at first since it is black material and black thread but there are areas that the sewing machine operator sewed outside the correct area and then just re-sewed over it to make it work and still left the mistake instead of fixing it first.,25403,2
25403,Very sloppy.,25403,2
25403,Also the tie around the neck is very cheap and will need to be changed as well.,25403,2
25403,Overall I think it is less that average quality but not the worst.,25403,2
25403,With a few tweaks and expense I will get the look I want.,25403,2
25404,Not actually a maternity shirt so it was really tight around my belly,25404,2
25405,:( too small,25405,2
25406,I'm not really impressed.,25406,2
25406,Cheaply made.,25406,2
25406,"Just ""ok""",25406,2
25407,This was just ok it looked weird on and I never could make it work,25407,2
25408,Wasn't true to size,25408,2
25409,All scratched up on my first trip,25409,2
25410,"The product I purchased was for my wife, when they came it looks like men's masculine dark rimmed glasses, and do not look anything like the picture online.",25410,2
25410,"Woman's glasses should look feminine, not like Buddy Holly glasses.",25410,2
25411,i was thinking this was for a child.,25411,2
25411,But it is way too big.,25411,2
25412,Cute but runs very small,25412,2
25413,"the logo is glossy and looks cheesy, fabric of shirt is decent though",25413,2
25414,"Picture is of long sleeved dress with high collar, dress that I got was open neck, 3/4 length tab sleeve.",25414,2
25414,"Although it was a good fit, follow their size chart, fabric very stretchy, true to color, what I got was not what I ordered.",25414,2
25414,I wanted the dress in the picture.,25414,2
25414,Don't know if I'll order from this one again.,25414,2
25415,It fits fine.,25415,2
25415,But after two months it became too loose and when I sit down with it my sides look weird I'm a petite 105lb woman.,25415,2
25416,"Order a size bigger than you would normally get really short, but other than the size feels good, nice quality hoodie.",25416,2
25417,I was really disappointed,25417,2
25418,Doesn't fit,25418,2
25419,Straight up and down!,25419,2
25419,Doesn't fit anything like the picture shows :(,25419,2
25420,They fit me fine and were comfortable when tried on.,25420,2
25420,"However, they are very shiny and became transparent when I would do anything other than stand around.",25420,2
25420,More like tights than leggings.,25420,2
25420,"I would recommend these for layering, but definitely not to be worn as leggings alone with your bum exposed.",25420,2
25421,"I don't know what product others received, but these particular bows DO NOT STRETCH!!",25421,2
25421,They are very pretty and I was really sad because they did not fit my 2 year olds head.,25421,2
25421,They are made of cotton and are about the size of a newborns head.,25421,2
25422,It fit well everywhere else exept it was too tight in the chest area and a little in the armpit area.,25422,2
25422,The material used for the zipper is cheap came off when I zipped it up to the top.,25422,2
25422,Buy a size up if u are bigger in the chest area.,25422,2
25423,Yikes!,25423,2
25423,This necklace is so bulky I feel like I have a bike tire around my neck,25423,2
25424,I didn't even have to try this top on to know that it would be too big for me...but of course I did just to make sure.,25424,2
25424,And the color is nowhere near as purple as the picture shows it to be.,25424,2
25424,It turns out to be on the pink side rather than a true purple.,25424,2
25424,So it was a disappointing purchase all around.,25424,2
25424,I've returned it.,25424,2
25425,"Doesn't look anything like the picture... it hits way to high and not on the waist, which isn't very flattering.",25425,2
25425,It was also a lot smaller than I'd expected it to be.,25425,2
25425,I will never wear it but it wasn't worth the price of sending it back.,25425,2
25425,Another casualty of online shopping I guess!,25425,2
25426,This sweater smelled like gasoline.,25426,2
25426,Took weeks to air out.,25426,2
25427,The shirt was thick and as rough as a canvas bag.,25427,2
25427,Very cheap cotton used.,25427,2
25427,"Oh well, good thing I didn't spend too much in this and it will only be used at the gym.",25427,2
25427,The graphic was ok.,25427,2
25428,These snapped within the first week I wore them.,25428,2
25428,"Love the look, horrible quality",25428,2
25429,I didn't like the way it fit me,25429,2
25430,"Great fit and was excited, but upon receiving it.",25430,2
25430,It was snagged already when I opened it up and the threads were dangling.,25430,2
25430,Very cute but disappointed that it was damaged when I received it.,25430,2
25431,"Short for 5 ft. 7"" person.",25431,2
25431,Quality good.,25431,2
25432,Definitely size up!,25432,2
25432,"I've worn a B cup for the last ten years, but the b cup size in this barely covered me which means it definitely give me the same look in the photo above.",25432,2
25432,"Since I could not wear it, I can't attest to the adhesive quality.",25432,2
25433,Image was not as clear in real life as in the picture.,25433,2
25433,It's essentially a picture with a clear dome over it.,25433,2
25433,The dome effect somewhat skews the image.,25433,2
25433,"Still pretty, just not AS pretty.",25433,2
25433,Probably not worth the money.,25433,2
25434,I ordered the smallest size ( girls 5-6) for my 5 and a half year old daughter but they fit me better than they do her.,25434,2
25435,A 2T looks like it should fit a 6 month old.,25435,2
25435,Very cute otherwise.,25435,2
25436,"The fit is fine, and I like that the material is lightweight, but unfortunately there are two holes in the back of the shirt.",25436,2
25436,It looks like it got cut in processing.,25436,2
25436,I will be returning it.,25436,2
25437,It was much larger than I wanted.,25437,2
25437,the fabric was also much different than advertised.,25437,2
25437,"and, there was a rip in the right strap.",25437,2
25437,Very disappointed.,25437,2
25438,"Why is it okay for these sellers to say ""TURQUOISE?""",25438,2
25438,I'm just so surprised they get away with it.,25438,2
25438,These are not turquoise.,25438,2
25438,Not even fake turquoise.,25438,2
25438,"That I understand, but there is nothing about these earrings that are any kind of turquoise.",25438,2
25438,"These earrings are ""Plastic"" and we should have the right to not only know this, but to speak about it as well.",25438,2
25438,"I know now that ""Alloy"" is not good for you.",25438,2
25438,"I should have checked earlier, but I was having so much fun getting all this inexpensive jewelry.",25438,2
25438,"I do not believe this will be posted, but I will discuss it because it is important.",25438,2
25438,This is false advertising.,25438,2
25438,Don't get me wrong I love Amazon.,25438,2
25438,It has been extremely important to me.,25438,2
25438,"So these earrings are not going to be warn, because of the plastic.",25438,2
25438,"The alloy that I have bought will be warn with a Jewelry Protected product , but I will stay away from it when all my packages get here.",25438,2
25438,The product doesn't work well enough.,25438,2
25438,Please just check and read about your metals.,25438,2
25438,And this is shameful that the sellers get away with this.,25438,2
25438,It's not ok that this isn't even fake turquoise.,25438,2
25438,And it usually costs too much and is too much of a hassle to send them back.,25438,2
25438,"I understand you get what you pay for, but I paid for fake turquoise.",25438,2
25438,Thank you for reading...,25438,2
25439,I have just received it today.,25439,2
25439,The bracelet is not like I thought it would have a lot smaller.,25439,2
25439,The clasp does not tightly as I thought.,25439,2
25440,Tried to return this because the sleeves were too short and there was seams coming loose.,25440,2
25440,I guess you get what you pay for.,25440,2
25440,Also one of the sides is sewn over to the shoulder so it doesnt fully open and has to be pulled over your head like shirt.,25440,2
25440,Material is scratchy.,25440,2
25440,I compromised with a partial refund and kept the shirt but have yet to wear it,25440,2
25441,Wish they had larger sizes.,25441,2
25441,Ordered a large hoping they would fit but they dont,25441,2
25442,The ring itself is beautiful.,25442,2
25442,However I have sensitive skin and I can only wear certain metals.,25442,2
25442,It gave me a bad allergic reaction.,25442,2
25442,"Also, it's a very big ring.",25442,2
25442,It looks like costume jewelry rather than an everyday piece of jewelry.,25442,2
25443,Decent but you can find better for about the same price.,25443,2
25443,They come just in a baggy losely so not very pretty for a present.,25443,2
25443,I returned to get same price with 36 pairs elsewhere..,25443,2
25444,Brim too big & floppy.,25444,2
25444,My daughter won't keep it on because she can't see.,25444,2
25445,First time in the shower it fogged up.,25445,2
25445,Definitely NOT waterproof!,25445,2
25445,!,25445,2
25446,I really wanted to love this bra as it sounded like everything I needed in a nursing/pumping bra as I returned to work.,25446,2
25446,The hands free pumping aspect works very well I think and lives up to its word.,25446,2
25446,"However, as the day goes on I find this bra to become increasingly uncomfortable.",25446,2
25446,The clips under the bust start to dig into my skin.,25446,2
25446,"Plus, the clips are difficult to reattach one handed after nursing.",25446,2
25446,"Also, the support isn't great and I am moving all day long at my job and don't feel like it's enough.",25446,2
25446,It seems as though the elasticity seems to give way halfway through the day.,25446,2
25446,It is a cute bra which is very rare in the nursing/pumping bra world it turns out.,25446,2
25446,"However, for the price I can't say that I think it's worth it and there is no way I would purchase an additional one.",25446,2
25447,"I got the XL for my BF who is 6'2"" and a slim build.",25447,2
25447,"Generally well made, certainly does not seem like any of the seams will split or buttons fall off.",25447,2
25447,"Fleece is thinner than expected (much thinner than on my other Kigu which is COZY brand), and see through.",25447,2
25447,"The tail is a stuffed puff that is hot glued on, and my BF reports that it is uncomfortable to sit on.",25447,2
25447,"Front closures are buttons, and it has a drawstring in the hood.",25447,2
25447,"Has pockets, but they are way too high (they were placed about 4"" down from armpit).",25447,2
25447,"There is a splotchy discoloration on the front in the chest area, and a small blue smear near one of the upper buttons.",25447,2
25447,"This is NOT patterned like any of the other kigus I have owned which are specifically over-sized in width with a low crotch, this particular one best supports a slimmer build.",25447,2
25448,"Very poor quality, too small",25448,2
25449,Buy a size larger then you would normally get,25449,2
25450,the first time i got this the top was to small and the bottom fit and I ordered a Medium which i always am.,25450,2
25450,I don't like how the top fit.,25450,2
25450,Between the black spaces it squeezes all your back skin up and it puts your boobs more squished down rather than pushing them up.,25450,2
25450,I ordered this product again in the Large which i never am and the bottom was to big and the top was still to small.,25450,2
25450,Unless you have tiny boobs i wouldn't bother.,25450,2
25450,i then lost 11 pounds and it seems to fit pretty well now so this is very tricky,25450,2
25451,While I love the dress...,25451,2
25451,It is very short.,25451,2
25451,Definitely not ankle length as shown in the picture and...,25451,2
25451,I'm only 5'5.,25451,2
25452,Was waiting impatiently for this purse because I wanted it so very much.,25452,2
25452,When I received the product the quality was poor.,25452,2
25452,"The pocket where you place your phone was coming away from the inner lining of the purse, it was glued not stitched.",25452,2
25452,I set the purse back with a great big frown.,25452,2
25453,"Very ornate pendant with necklace, but this pendant was too large for me.",25453,2
25453,"For others it might be perfect, but this was not to my liking, so I had to return it.",25453,2
25454,Junk,25454,2
25455,Runs about two sizes smaller,25455,2
25456,Never wore it.,25456,2
25456,Probably will give it away.,25456,2
25457,The seams were not well sewn.,25457,2
25457,Many of them popped and I wasn't even doing anything strenuous like dancing in it.,25457,2
25457,"I walked to our table, sat down and had to go home without dancing because the seems popped.",25457,2
25457,"The dress was not too tight or anything, just poorly made.",25457,2
25457,I left it at 2 stars because it was beautiful on.,25457,2
25458,The color nothing to be with the pic,25458,2
25459,The lining on the inside of the bag takes up most of the room.,25459,2
25459,I liked the look for the bag because it seemed to have a lot of room.,25459,2
25459,Not so!,25459,2
25460,The material is not well made.,25460,2
25460,It broke as soon as my daughter put it on,25460,2
25461,Quality is not up to expectation,25461,2
25462,Cute and easy to keep track of however these scissors are on the dull side.,25462,2
25462,I have a difficult time even cutting through bandages!,25462,2
25463,"I loved this dress when I saw it online........but, not unexpectedly, it is too small in the upper torso area.",25463,2
25464,The waist is so snall.coated to the rest of the dress.,25464,2
25464,It's not stretchy at all.,25464,2
25465,It was very compact but it was too small for my need.,25465,2
25465,I had difficulties removing cards from inner pockets.,25465,2
25465,I had to return it.,25465,2
25466,"Well, it came in a cute bag, for sure!",25466,2
25466,Holy crap.,25466,2
25466,I definitely didn't expect this synthetic material.,25466,2
25466,The button holes were ripped and barely open.,25466,2
25466,The hang is large and the shoulders are almost at my elbow.,25466,2
25466,"I got a Large, and Im 50 and 150 lbs.",25466,2
25466,It hung below my butt.,25466,2
25466,There are several loose threads all over.,25466,2
25466,"Buy from a nicer seller for the price, which, by the way, shipping included I spent $23, and it looks like the price for the jacket alone has increased several dollars.",25466,2
25466,"You cannot wear the sleeves down, which I had truly prayed would be an option.",25466,2
25466,There aren't pictures for this product without pixelation for a reason.,25466,2
25466,"Ill wear it, but not as often as Id hoped, and if I gain weight, then this may be of more use.",25466,2
25466,"As it stands, when you put it on, if you have it wrapped on you or use a belt to tighten the loose fit, every feature of your back will be visible.",25466,2
25466,Up to you.,25466,2
25467,Everything fit except the bust area was way to small.,25467,2
25468,One of customer's picture and review fooled me.,25468,2
25468,It could probably look good to someone who is taller.,25468,2
25468,I should have exchanged or returned mine but I decided to kept it anyways...,25468,2
25469,For a person like me who doesn't have big boobs it didn't fit my body type so well.,25469,2
25469,But it did fit.,25469,2
25469,The color wasn't exactly as shown in the picture it's more of a orange-gold.,25469,2
25469,And also the corset doesn't give u the curves in made very straight.,25469,2
25470,Way to small one size fits most but definitely not girls with a bust size of 41 or 42 not made for girls with veryyyy big breasts at all your boobs will be coming out from the sides and everything,25470,2
25471,i bought this dress in XXL but i don' t like how the breast area fits and i usually wear L but i jus bought it big for d belly area but .,25471,2
25471,the line suppose to fall under the buss line but its cut too short and it doesn't have any shape to it.,25471,2
25471,it have me looking square.,25471,2
25471,"i not planned to send it back however, i will wear a cardigan with it.",25471,2
25471,Not what I'm expected.,25471,2
25472,It came with a bunch of options but as soon as I started to twist one in my ear the black paint came off.,25472,2
25473,I like the fabric.,25473,2
25473,The shirt is not to size.,25473,2
25473,It is supposed to be a mans xxL it's more like a L.  I am afraid to see what happens when it gets washed.,25473,2
25474,This ring is every bit as pretty as it looks in the picture.,25474,2
25474,My husband gave it to my daughter as a purety ring on Dec. 12th when he adopted her (step parent adoption).,25474,2
25474,The band is already completely bent and the heart is bent on the band too.,25474,2
25474,I can't return it because we bought it more than 30 days ago.,25474,2
25474,We bought it in Aug. but the adoption got delayed by the court:-(,25474,2
25475,This size only fts little girl,25475,2
25476,Returned this product.,25476,2
25476,It is beautiful just like the picture but we bought a size small ... my wife is 5'2'' and very slim.,25476,2
25476,"The ""elastic"" flexibility was not enough to make it fit like what the model looked like around the upper waist.",25476,2
25476,I am sure many other people may have the body type but didn't fit for my best friend!,25476,2
25476,We regretfully are processing a return for this item.,25476,2
25477,"Nice vest, but as others described, it does run a size to small.",25477,2
25478,Too small..I got an XL...NOT CUT RIGHT,25478,2
25479,Sad that it's already started to tarnish!,25479,2
25479,Thought it was real silver.,25479,2
25480,Boxy...,25480,2
25480,Rides up.,25480,2
25480,Doesn't really cover butt.,25480,2
25480,I am 112 at 5'4 and got the small.,25480,2
25480,It is crazy soft though.,25480,2
25481,Earrings hang differently and the post part start at different spots,25481,2
25482,"The idea behind this is wonderful, the execution however, was horrific, weird material that allows no breathability or room to wear underwear or a bra underneath without everyone knowing what you've got on.",25482,2
25483,Not true to size,25483,2
25484,"It looked adorable, I loved how it looked, but it's not the best quality bellybutton ring I've had - the bottom part actually snapped off in the shower (not like I was bungee jumping or doing anything wild) after wearing it on and off for a few weeks.",25484,2
25484,I could've glued it back together but  I try not to mix too many chemicals and piercings.,25484,2
25484,"It's super super cute and didn't irritate my piercing, but handle with care!",25484,2
25485,Not really what I was expected.,25485,2
25486,If was cheap looking and too tight,25486,2
25487,I liked the cut but this runs very small!,25487,2
25487,Good company to deal with.,25487,2
25487,returned with no issues.,25487,2
25488,"not happy with the shape or the quality, sent it back.",25488,2
25489,"As a plus-sized woman, I do know to take ""one size fits most"" with several grains of salt.",25489,2
25489,"But when the description says fits up to a bust size of 52"", I assume there will be enough fabric in the skirt to correspond to the max size.",25489,2
25489,"Not so, in this case.",25489,2
25489,"The bust did stretch to cover my bust, which is under the max size, but did not have any give or extra fabric in the skirt, and I was unable to get it even over my hips.",25489,2
25489,"I should have been  more skeptical, perhaps, but I did, after all, arrive at this item by using plus size as a specific search term.",25489,2
25489,"I will be more careful in future, but I would suggest that this not be linked to plus size searches, and that buyers take note that just because the bust has give, the waist/hips do not.",25489,2
25490,The zipper broke the second week.,25490,2
25490,Very disappointed.,25490,2
25490,Looks nice and just as in picture.,25490,2
25491,I own a lot of Oakley.,25491,2
25491,Very low quality backpack.,25491,2
25491,But you get what you pay for.,25491,2
25491,"The straps feel cheap, and the Oakley logo will fall off (almost feels like a big sticker).",25491,2
25491,"If you want to show off your Oakley backpack, look somewhere else.",25491,2
25491,"This is great for road trips or concerts, but not for carrying a lot of stuff or for looking cool.",25491,2
25492,They were so cute for one wear .. but the seams started ripping after only one wash,25492,2
25493,Super tight not the size they say.,25493,2
25493,Graphics are good.,25493,2
25493,Pull tabs were on packaging but when pulled they still do not light up.,25493,2
25493,Disappointed... there is a velcro tab in them with batteries inside the light up part.,25493,2
25493,Not comfortable.,25493,2
25493,Little man was very upset they barely fit and do not light up.,25493,2
25494,Little small,25494,2
25495,the material feels and looks rather cheap.,25495,2
25495,It also is prone to snagging so I have to be very careful with it.,25495,2
25495,I will use it this summer with jeans but will most likely toss it after Labor Day.,25495,2
25495,I am disappointed.,25495,2
25496,I am 5'4'' 135lbs and size 36DD in bust size.,25496,2
25496,"Before ordering this romper I read all the reviews and saw that it runs a little small, so instead of ordering a Medium, I ordered a Large in Blue.",25496,2
25496,"When I received this product, the material was beautiful, loved the light weight, and the pattern for the material.",25496,2
25496,However when I went to try it on it fits so strange.,25496,2
25496,"The romper is extremely short, like just barely hangs to the bottom of my butt cheeks, and if we are being honest, I don't have a very curvy butt.",25496,2
25496,Also if I bend over to pick up my purse or bag MORE than half my butt would show!,25496,2
25496,"The top of the romper is also a problem, it's extremely HUGE, when I'm wearing my bra.",25496,2
25496,"I can't go braless because that looks sloppy to me, but also with the top so big and floppy I would not have very much coverage, and there is no built in support.",25496,2
25496,Also this is with the straps tightened/ shortened as much as they will go.,25496,2
25496,I'm used to tops fitting me not having so much material that it exposes me.,25496,2
25496,"I am disappointed, judging from other peoples comments, and the pictures provided I definitely thought that this would be a winner.",25496,2
25496,"I guess I can still wear this product if I wear a tank top underneath, but then there is still the problem of it being so short that I would feel uncomfortable in it.",25496,2
25496,"So, another online purchase down the drain.",25496,2
25496,Darn!,25496,2
25497,Fits like a tent,25497,2
25498,"These were great to look at, but I could not get the posts to fit in my ears.",25498,2
25498,Had to return.,25498,2
25499,"To small I ordered a 2X, I am a large bust 40dd it would not button over the bust and sleeves were short.",25499,2
25499,Buy three size up,25499,2
25500,had to return... a very cute floppy hat however i ordered it for my grandson... would be adorable on a baby girl!,25500,2
25501,They are nice but fit way to tight on my daughter work best as under shirts.,25501,2
25502,Had moldy smell.,25502,2
25502,It's ok for the price.,25502,2
25503,"I'm a pretty stocky dude; and to be modest, my chest muscles protrude out ""just a little"" farther than the average guy.",25503,2
25503,"If you're in the same boat as me, don't buy these; unless of course, you like your armholes stretching forward and making you look weird or douchey.",25503,2
25503,"Definitely for people with a slim build, specifically in the chest area.",25503,2
25504,Rayon is the main material which shrinks when washed.,25504,2
25504,Polyester needs to be the main material,25504,2
25505,What a let down.,25505,2
25505,This is a small scarf NOT a scarf you can to much with other than lay around your neck.,25505,2
25505,I was expecting something larger enough to use as a head wrap.,25505,2
25505,Pretty and very small.,25505,2
25505,Was not worth my money and time.,25505,2
25506,The glitter is a mess.,25506,2
25506,The glitter oatch on the arms rubs and caused irritation on my upper arms.,25506,2
25507,One of the cheapest shoes I've ever purchased.,25507,2
25507,you get what you pay for.,25507,2
25507,The shipping cost was ridiculous.,25507,2
25507,Very cute but would never buy again.,25507,2
25508,The straps are too long and the body of the skirt doesn't fit the body right.,25508,2
25508,It's longer in person than in the picture,25508,2
25509,Comes very small.,25509,2
25509,sad it was really cute,25509,2
25510,This dress was way too small when I ordered it.,25510,2
25510,Definitely go at least a size up.,25510,2
25510,"in addition to being small, it was also see through.",25510,2
25510,I returned it immediately.,25510,2
25511,Ordered an XL and the bottoms fit like an XS.,25511,2
25511,Top is okay but still on the smaller side.,25511,2
25511,I am 5'1 and 140 lbs.,25511,2
25512,The dress is very pretty.,25512,2
25512,I loved it.,25512,2
25512,Hate the fact that it fits so small.,25512,2
25512,It is at least 2 sizes too small.,25512,2
25512,I bought a medium and had to get an XL (that fits just right).,25512,2
25513,I was wearing these to a con and I got blisters not even walking an hour in them..,25513,2
25513,I bought some Dr. Scholl's but my feet were still hurting by the end of the day,25513,2
25514,"Quality of item is good, but I was very disappointed when I received it that the top or flat side of the clip was just an advertisement for the company.",25514,2
25514,It really cheapens the look to be just a promotional item and not a piece of jewelry.,25514,2
25514,Just not what I expected to received.,25514,2
25514,"Thank you

Rich Baldoz",25514,2
25515,"It's okay, but SCRATCHY.",25515,2
25516,It's cute.,25516,2
25516,I do like it for the most part but it doesn't fit snugly against your stomach and back like in the picture.,25516,2
25516,"It fits well for my height, but around the waste is not as tight as I would have liked.",25516,2
25517,The dress was somewhat shoddy in design and had threads from loose stitching hanging off of it everywhere.,25517,2
25517,I bought a size 8.,25517,2
25517,"The hem fell much too long, down to my calves.",25517,2
25517,"(I'm 5'4"" and 145lbs) The dress looks like it should be knee length, but it just was unflattering.",25517,2
25517,Returned.,25517,2
25518,Quality looks very cheesy for the price.,25518,2
25518,Did not actually use it as yet.,25518,2
25519,Too small,25519,2
25520,"I got a L and should have gotten a M. I was basing it off the reviews, but this was far too big.",25520,2
25520,"I am 5'6"", 140, and usually wear a 4 in dresses.",25520,2
25521,The hips are a little small and the shoulders are a little large.,25521,2
25521,Doesn't look as nice as in the picture and it's not because I have a huge hips or anything because I don't at all.,25521,2
25522,cheaply made...the straps on the back was not stitched at all..had to seam it again,25522,2
25523,Should give size,25523,2
25524,I was trying to purchase these for a 4 year-old toddler.,25524,2
25524,These are sized for a 2 year-old toddler and were way too small,25524,2
25525,So disappointed.,25525,2
25525,So many issues.,25525,2
25525,"Too small, somewhat melted together upon arrival, and quality is very poor.",25525,2
25525,Many of the reviews on here suggested going a size down because it apparently runs small.,25525,2
25525,This was not the case for me.,25525,2
25525,A size down made it near impossible to get on.,25525,2
25525,"And unfortunately there ware no fasteners or zippers in the back, which would have been extremely helpful.",25525,2
25525,The material on the bust is awful.,25525,2
25525,Super scratchy/itchy material.,25525,2
25525,Very hot and uncomfortable.,25525,2
25525,"The skirt bunches at the top, so it's kind of a mushroom shape down there.",25525,2
25525,Not flattering at all.,25525,2
25525,When I opened my package all the material was slightly melted together as well.,25525,2
25525,Pulling the pieces apart from one another resulted in discoloration.,25525,2
25525,Very unhappy with this purchase.,25525,2
25525,I'm pretty sure it's not returnable now either because I already unpackaged everything in order to try it on.,25525,2
25526,No quality to this product.,25526,2
25526,Clasp already (after wearing once) doesn't close,25526,2
25527,The hood was weird on this sweatshirt and it is small in the bust,25527,2
25528,Definitely NOT white!!!,25528,2
25528,"Seller should advertise as KHAKI, CREAM or TAN.",25528,2
25528,"Size I ordered fit, BUT the belt loops are positioned so high that the belt sits around my rib cage and NOT around my waist as should be expected.",25528,2
25528,"Very disappointed, especially knowing I won't be able to return it to this Int'l seller.",25528,2
25528,:(,25528,2
25529,bad experience cheap clothes .color faid,25529,2
25530,It's says khaki however it is more yellow than the picture shows.,25530,2
25531,"Looks cute and it if it's perfectly, but after wearing it 5 times, the zipper is broken.",25531,2
25531,"It can't be fixed either, the straps are also very long",25531,2
25532,One of the zippers were off when I opened the box.,25532,2
25532,Which I would love to get fixed or replaced.,25532,2
25532,Other than that pretty cool bag,25532,2
25533,"The dress is very cute.would have been perfect, but it's at least 4 sizes smaller than stated.",25533,2
25533,I'd say any woman who wears a size above Large shouldn't even bother with this dress.,25533,2
25533,It was at least 3 sizes too small.,25533,2
25533,They should adjust their sizing to reflect the TRUE size and not the Asian version of that size.,25533,2
25533,I ordered a  3xl and I would compare it to a Large....nowhere near a true 3xl.,25533,2
25533,This is not a plus size dress unless you're short and petite plus size.,25533,2
25533,If you are over 5'9 and weight over 200lbs.......don't even waste your time.,25533,2
25534,"too tight, not enough coverage",25534,2
25535,too thin,25535,2
25536,"RETURNED PURSE...Nice purse, but much too small and quaint for an adult over 30.",25536,2
25536,"It's appears to be more suitable for a pre-teen, adolescent or young adult.",25536,2
25536,"Color was nice, but too playful & animated for my taste.",25536,2
25536,Color was not adequate or true to pic.,25536,2
25537,"Was ugly in person, although it photographs well, and it was more like a short mumu than how it is pictured to fit nicely.",25537,2
25537,Returned it.,25537,2
25538,Beautiful top.,25538,2
25538,But way too small.,25538,2
25539,Got these for a gift.,25539,2
25539,Sadly they ripped within 2 hours of wearing.,25539,2
25539,Normal walking around.,25539,2
25539,Bummed.,25539,2
25540,I don't think these are actually stone and they irritate my ears like a mf,25540,2
25541,"I don't like it.if you have  big breasts, do not buy it.",25541,2
25542,Cheap looking but the wife wears it,25542,2
25543,"I absolutely loved this hoodie, its very soft & thick so super warm & the high neck keeps the cold out well.",25543,2
25543,"However, you have to order 3-4 sizes bigger than what you would normally wear.",25543,2
25543,"I normally wear an XL, but I wanted this bigger & saw that they run small so I ordered a XXL.",25543,2
25543,"I believe they may be XXL for a toddler, but not for an adult.",25543,2
25543,I purchased 2 of these & when I got them I couldn't even get them past my neck.,25543,2
25543,They are so small & tight that I couldn't get it over my shoulders at all.,25543,2
25543,My 10 year old child kept one of them as it fit them perfectly.,25543,2
25543,I  requested to return this one & there was no response from the seller at all so I ended up having to file an Amazon claim to get my money back.,25543,2
25543,"Also, it doesn't tell you this until after your order, but these ship from China, so expect appx 3 weeks for delivery.",25543,2
25544,Wife says thin material and apparently a one size fits all (?).,25544,2
25544,Did not fit.,25544,2
25544,"Took a very long time to arrive, like 6 - 8 weeks.",25544,2
25545,Wrong color,25545,2
25546,"These are super cute, except I literally got them today, washed them and they shrunk SIGNIFICANTLY.",25546,2
25546,Now I'm not sure if my 4 year old will even be able to wear them.,25546,2
25547,Love the style !,25547,2
25547,I order a medium cause thats my size but it runs super small i don't think large would fit me !,25547,2
25548,Cute but doesn't really glow,25548,2
25549,"Nice average shirt, too small.",25549,2
25549,If you are a large order a double large.,25549,2
25550,Not an easy belt to get on and off.,25550,2
25551,First off the anklet does have good bling.,25551,2
25551,The problem is the bracelet is far too big to be an anklet.,25551,2
25551,I bought it for my wife and it just falls down to her foot.,25551,2
25551,The elastic should be tight enough to have it stay on her ankle.,25551,2
25551,She has a normal size ankle she is not a twig but she doesn't have cankles either.,25551,2
25551,If this would fit right it would be 5 stars for the price.,25551,2
25551,"I read other reviews that said it was too tight, wondering how big the are.",25551,2
25552,Too small sizes does not match the sizes in US measurement,25552,2
25553,We got the pj set but we were not sent the set we had ordered.,25553,2
25553,Ordering the raccoon and dog PJs we got a striped fox and fire engine set instead.,25553,2
25554,This item runs quite small.,25554,2
25555,The suit  fits great everywhere  but in the chest!,25555,2
25555,If you are very small chested it will fit .,25555,2
25556,"Product came fast, but when I removed a sticker on side of coin purse, it took the color with it!",25556,2
25557,The size chart is misleading.,25557,2
25557,We went up a size to be safe and it was still too small.,25557,2
25557,:-/,25557,2
25558,Not made properly.,25558,2
25559,Sizing is deceiving!!,25559,2
25559,I ordered the XL and it arrived and is clearly labeled size L-XL.,25559,2
25559,So its a bit small.,25559,2
25559,I am a true XL so therefore this top fits tight everywhere!,25559,2
25559,I am not sure I want to hassle with the return because it was not a Prime item.,25559,2
25559,When will I learn!,25559,2
25559,"Never, never buy anything unless it's Prime!!",25559,2
25559,Item came straight from China so I knew this was not going to end well.,25559,2
25559,Still thinking about returning just on the basis of principle.,25559,2
25559,The only good thing is the colors are great which is why I gave this 2 stars.,25559,2
25560,I ordered a size 10 because everyone said it runs small.,25560,2
25560,It was too big so I returned it,25560,2
25561,I was very disappointed.,25561,2
25561,It looks better on the picture,25561,2
25562,The connection to charge the battery keeps going down the seam of the shoe and I have to use a pair of tweezers to get it out every time they are used.,25562,2
25563,Not made as well as i was thinking.,25563,2
25564,First was to big,25564,2
25565,"They were ok, the lens was a lot lighter than I expected.",25565,2
25565,"They're very lite in wight, they seem like they could bend easily.",25565,2
25566,not good,25566,2
25567,"Nice color and style, however, I am not tall and I am not large, but the XL was short on the torso and very awkward fitting.",25567,2
25567,"I really wanted to like it because of the color and trim, but it just was cut all wrong for an average-sized and shaped person.",25567,2
25567,"What a larger person would do, God help them.",25567,2
25568,i bought this for my son and he loved it.but it got damaged the same day he wore it.,25568,2
25569,I like the design but I'm apparently godzilla size.,25569,2
25569,"Generally 2XL are quite roomy on me, not on this one.",25569,2
25569,I suggested going 2-3 sizes larger than your norm.,25569,2
25570,Top call not be adjusted.,25570,2
25570,I'm top heavy but small and I can't adjust the straps or anything.,25570,2
25571,"Long in the front and short in the back, odd fit.",25571,2
25572,This is more like a size10 in little girls.,25572,2
25572,Had to give it away,25572,2
25573,"I bought this bag for my new job, and I was really excited about it.",25573,2
25573,"I love how it felt, and the fact that it had three different ways to be carried.",25573,2
25573,"Except when I went to use the longest strap, it broke off like nothing.",25573,2
25573,"I returned it and wanted to get the same black one with brown handles, and they don't even have it available anymore.",25573,2
25573,"So the quality wasn't great, but I liked the design.",25573,2
25573,I wish it would have been durable.,25573,2
25574,"Poor, not clear.",25574,2
25575,It was missing a snap.,25575,2
25575,Also a little on the small side if you have bigger wrists.,25575,2
25576,"these were not exactly like the original liners that came with my snow boots..the company told me that they had used a new pattern to make the same liner and the pattern turned out to be very much narrower than the original snow boot liner..,so I returned them for a full refund..they said they would work on the liners to remake them wider as the original ones were in past yrs....",25576,2
25577,"Well, at first I thought I liked them - and I did.",25577,2
25577,"But after 3 washings (gentle cycle/warm water and line dry), the mesh inserts around calves started fraying at the hem, and while wearing them yesterday, I noticed a tiny tear in the rear-end seam!",25577,2
25577,Thank God I was working out in a private area of the gym.,25577,2
25577,I was surprised to see this and SO disappointed in RBX as my other RBX pants have been great.,25577,2
25577,They made their new home in the trash.,25577,2
25578,Flimsy and tear easily.,25578,2
25578,Not what I expected.,25578,2
25579,Pretty color and fabric.,25579,2
25579,I purchased a larger size and it is too small.,25579,2
25580,Cute but way to wide for my 5 month old.,25580,2
25581,They are very small and cheap looking.,25581,2
25581,If I had not thrown the packing slip away I would have returned them,25581,2
25582,I was so confused about the reviews here.,25582,2
25582,"First, I knew it was coming from China.",25582,2
25582,So I ordered the 2xl.,25582,2
25582,I am 5'5' and 170.,25582,2
25582,It was tight on me and not flowy at all.,25582,2
25582,I do LOVE the pattern.,25582,2
25582,It did not smell.,25582,2
25582,But it was extremely see through.,25582,2
25582,I am worried about washing it as I believe it will fall apart as the other reviewers indicated.,25582,2
25582,It's not bad for the price.,25582,2
25582,I paired it with a white cami and a burgandy cardigan.,25582,2
25582,I wish it was made with more substantial material... it would be totally worth it.,25582,2
25582,I would never buy this again!,25582,2
25583,"Loved the bag, lots of organization, but about two weeks in the stitching started coming out.",25583,2
25583,"Among other places the end of the zipper came loose and I was unable to get it back on track,  So now I am going to have to buy a new purse, because it is useless without the main zipper.",25583,2
25583,".Since the other stitching is failing, fixing the zipper would not have helped anyway.",25583,2
25583,If only they had used a smaller stitch and a better thread.,25583,2
25584,I really like this shirt.,25584,2
25584,Completely says what I like to do most.,25584,2
25584,Only issue is I bought an xl because I'm really large in the chest and this fits more like a medium.,25584,2
25585,way too small,25585,2
25586,Not a great quality,25586,2
25587,"Rose was poorly attached, had to reattach.",25587,2
25587,Stretches pretty good.,25587,2
25588,top fits weird.,25588,2
25588,won't ever wear it.,25588,2
25588,But it is cute,25588,2
25589,I really like it but it's to small 4 me,25589,2
25590,Not black and white.,25590,2
25590,Nice fabric.,25590,2
25590,Disappointing it was purple and blue.,25590,2
25591,The top is a bit large and loose - little support and hangs a bit low.,25591,2
25591,"Also, the skirt floats up in the water and the floral decal is not appealing and rather juvenile.",25591,2
25592,"quite an awkward fit overall, it was like a tent on me (size 18-20)",25592,2
25593,It's a sweater dress so I expected it to be more substantial than it is.,25593,2
25593,Very thin fabric.,25593,2
25594,Too large,25594,2
25595,"I didn't really like the fit, it was a bit awkward and the color was completely different than what is shown.",25595,2
25596,Too small,25596,2
25597,"I I thought It be more form fitting but it was just too big, i ordered a size medium",25597,2
25598,I was so disappointed with this necklace when I opened my Christmas present.,25598,2
25598,"For the price, the charm is super small, you almost have to squint to read it.",25598,2
25598,"I wasn't expecting anything huge, but a least a necklace that had a little substance to it.",25598,2
25598,"There's another necklace by Out of Print for the Great Gatsby, but my experience with this has me re-thinking purchasing anything else from this group.",25598,2
25598,"Which is sad, because I love a lot of their merchandise and their mission.",25598,2
25599,"I wore these for a couple of months, hoping they would work as a cheaper alternative to the ones I had used for years, however in the end I went back and purchased the more expensive ones.",25599,2
25599,"These were okay, although they definitely have more lift than I personally wanted, they gave me a slight pain in my arch that went away after a short time wearing them.",25599,2
25599,One surprise side-effect that I originally attributed to my shoes was the pain on the top of my foot that I had while wearing these.,25599,2
25599,It seemed I couldn't tie my shoe loosely enough for my foot to not hurt unless it felt like it was about to fall off.,25599,2
25599,"After I replaced these I realized my shoes were not to blame, but these orthodics were.",25599,2
25599,"However, what really drove me to replace them was the fact that I managed to wear a hole through them underneath the ball of my foot within 2-3 months of getting them.",25599,2
25599,"My old footbeds lasted for years (embarrassing as it should probably be that I used them that long) and when they did start to wear out I didn't even realize at first because it didn't really affect the performance much, when these went it was very obvious when I wore them and slightly uncomfortable.",25599,2
25599,"I do lead an active life, usually playing racquetball or running on a treadmill or going for a hike every day, and walking anywhere from 12000-20000 steps a day, but I still expected these to hold up longer than they did.",25599,2
25600,Was very disappointed to discover these shoes have no arch support.,25600,2
25600,I am hoping to return.,25600,2
25600,I am very disappointed New Balance is selling walking shoes with no arch support.,25600,2
25601,Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter 6-8 size.,25601,2
25601,The bottom fit fine but the top was way too large and loose.,25601,2
25601,I wanted to send it back but she was upset and wants to use it without the top.,25601,2
25601,Seems to be a problem with size marching.,25601,2
25602,The back was droopy so she looked to small,25602,2
25603,The top part is much too small,25603,2
25604,gown is cut straight and has no room for movement.,25604,2
25604,The material is stiff and not  comfortable.,25604,2
25604,Might be suitable for kids.,25604,2
25605,I wanted to like it but the torso was not long enough :(,25605,2
25606,I actually do not like it.,25606,2
25606,The QUALITY WAS TERRIBLE!!!!,25606,2
25606,It was this and way too small around the shoulders.,25606,2
25606,I couldn't hardly raise my arms up.,25606,2
25606,The waist line was too big and stuck out.,25606,2
25606,Can I return it for a full refund?,25606,2
25607,You get what you pay for and it took about 45 days.,25607,2
25608,"Runs small, the arms are a little tight.",25608,2
25609,I only received 2 pairs of earrings.,25609,2
25609,The black agate were not included.,25609,2
25610,There was some screen print ink smeared on the top left shoulder,25610,2
25611,"Great shirt, but the front is weirdly short for some reason.",25611,2
25611,"It seems to be an irregular, or a mistake.",25611,2
25612,Seemed like both the dress and the belt were pretty cheaply made.,25612,2
25612,I was disappointed.,25612,2
25613,I bought these Elmo underwear for my 2 year old.,25613,2
25613,"I thought I would be receiving the same designs as the picture, but I was sent various Sesame Street characters instead.",25613,2
25613,I am disappointed because I purposely selected these because it's Elmo playing sports.,25613,2
25613,"Would return, but kiddo opened and wanted to try them all on.",25613,2
25614,The shirt fit well through the body but the arms were rediculously small.,25614,2
25614,I could barely fit my arms in the sleeves.,25614,2
25614,"If you ever watched the Cosby Show and saw the episode where Denise made Theo the knock-off Gordan Gartell shirt, that was this shirt.",25614,2
25614,[...],25614,2
25615,It's nice and warm but the pleats are in the wrong location.,25615,2
25615,The pockets were sewn where it forced the skirt to be worn with a center pleat.,25615,2
25615,Had they been moved 6 inches in either direction the front would be flat and the pleats on the side where they should be.,25615,2
25615,"And although the skirt is lined which eliminates the itch from the wool, the waist band is not which makes it uncomfortable to wear.",25615,2
25616,Wayyy too small.,25616,2
25616,"I am 5'6 130lbs, I ordered a medium but should have ordered a large based on the other reviews, but that wouldn't have even fit.",25616,2
25616,I'm wondering if the XL bottoms still would have been too small.,25616,2
25616,I couldn't get the bottoms on and barely could the top.,25616,2
25616,The print in person is cute like the photo though and the material is fine so that's why I gave it 3 stars.,25616,2
25616,Order 2 sizes up,25616,2
25617,"the material is cool, soft, and fits comfortably; but the seams are already tearing and i only washed them once by hand.",25617,2
25617,"It's disappointing that I paid $20, when they may be worth $10",25617,2
25618,"I have these in other colors and I love them, but the pale pink color is more beige than pink.",25618,2
25618,"Sort of matches my skin tone, makes me look naked :(",25618,2
25619,"Cute but too large, still won't fit my 3 month old, hopefully will fit in the next month or so",25619,2
25620,Broke when putting it on.,25620,2
25620,"It looks great from a few feet away, was hoping to get at least one use out of it.",25620,2
25621,To small,25621,2
25622,"Cute stockings, HOWEVER, these are definitely made for someone at least 6'2"" or something.",25622,2
25622,"I am 5'7"" and have pretty long legs and they come up to my butt with room for more length.",25622,2
25623,The maker of this dress clearly doesn't have a conception of 3xl size in the US I was highly dissapointed.,25623,2
25623,Fortunately my Neighbor could fit the dress so I gave it to her she is a size 14.,25623,2
25623,The look on her face said it all and I was happy to have made her day.....,25623,2
25624,Quality of jacket is adequate for the cheap price.,25624,2
25624,Sizing was way to small.,25624,2
25624,Order 2 sizes larger than you wear to ensure fit.,25624,2
25624,Return process was automated return emails from different names offering options other than return.,25624,2
25624,Finally kept jacket for partial refund and gave the thing to goodwill.,25624,2
25625,Unfortunately it runs smaller than anticipated.,25625,2
25625,"I have not been able to use it, so it sits there on in my drawer.",25625,2
25626,The shirt was too small and couldn't return it for a bigger size.,25626,2
25626,If your a size l try to order two size bigger.,25626,2
25626,Other than that it was a nice shirt to bad it didn't fit nor I couldn't return it,25626,2
25627,"I receieved my dress earlier than expected, which was amazing.",25627,2
25627,Tragedy struck as soon as I put on the dress.,25627,2
25627,"I'm 120 lbs and 5'2"" and I ordered a small at first, and that was too small so later I ordered a medium.",25627,2
25627,The fit was perfect but the zipper was faulty.,25627,2
25627,I bought this dress for a wedding and had ordered it just a week before the event.,25627,2
25627,"The day of the wedding, I put my dress on, attempted to zip it, and couldn't.",25627,2
25627,"I hadn't gained any extra weight, it was the zipper.",25627,2
25627,It got caught in the fabric and got stuck.,25627,2
25627,My boyfriend even tried zipping it and it broke.,25627,2
25627,Not the dress to buy.,25627,2
25627,"ALthough it is beautiful, the zipper made it dreadful.",25627,2
25628,Really small.,25628,2
25628,I ordered a large it fits like a  fitted T. the picture is misleading.,25628,2
25629,"Bought the same brand and size at a retail store a few years ago, and they fit just fine.",25629,2
25629,"Since then I've lost weight, and these are a bit of a snug fit!",25629,2
25629,And the material is thinner.,25629,2
25629,The quality tells me that Fruit of the Loom is not the same company that it used to be.,25629,2
25629,The label says that they were made in Vietnam.,25629,2
25630,This outfit was made out of very thin cheap fabric.,25630,2
25630,I was very disappointed.,25630,2
25631,"I've purchased Cowgirl Tuff jeans in the past that were excellent quality, but these were not.",25631,2
25631,"When I received them, I noticed that one of the belt loops wasn't stitched to the jeans (after I removed the tags) and the first time I wore them, all of the stitching started to unravel.",25631,2
25631,Disappointed in this style.,25631,2
25632,Nice quality but they run small.,25632,2
25633,poor quality,25633,2
25634,Artificial beads/stones.,25634,2
25634,Color is wearing off since coated in colored paint.,25634,2
25634,Dissapointed.,25634,2
25635,Fits akwardly.,25635,2
25635,I was really excited to receive this but it fits and hangs weird.,25635,2
25635,Have not warn it.,25635,2
25636,"Very thin, not flattering to me.",25636,2
25636,Would be cute on someone who is more fit.,25636,2
25637,Way to small.,25637,2
25638,It's not a dress.,25638,2
25638,It's a top.,25638,2
25638,It's so short and looks nothing like the picture.,25638,2
25638,I will however use it as a shirt.,25638,2
25639,"These only got a 2 star Bc they ARE beautiful however, beads keep falling off every time your head moves.",25639,2
25639,Super disappointed.,25639,2
25640,These are huge.,25640,2
25640,HUGE.,25640,2
25640,My kid MIGHT fit these when he's 10.,25640,2
25641,Very light and not the size you think it will be.,25641,2
25641,The come thin,25641,2
25642,Colour def not what it looks in the pic!,25642,2
25642,It's much more dull than the pic,25642,2
25643,Its pretty but too small in the waist.,25643,2
25644,I was not highly satisfied as the rubber band got cut by itself which made it loose.,25644,2
25645,"Is wrong size from what I ordered , but will give it to my Daughter who is that size .",25645,2
25646,Doesn't fit or look like anything in the picture.,25646,2
25646,It's cut very short and fits funny on top.,25646,2
25646,"I got a large because I'm 5'5"" and 36ddd but it was too big around the stomach but too short.",25646,2
25646,Not shiny like the picture but more like a matte look if that makes sense and the words are iron on.,25646,2
25647,"I ordered this in large and the large looks like a xsmall, I'm 5'3 and 160lbs.",25647,2
25648,"Material is thin, though not transparent.",25648,2
25648,I got it in dark blue so I can't speak for the white or lighter colors.,25648,2
25648,Elastic around the sleeves is pretty tight.,25648,2
25648,It left marks in my forearms.,25648,2
25648,The inner seam of the pocket came undone the first time I wore it.,25648,2
25648,Be prepared to constantly tug it down your shoulders if you want the off-the-shoulder look.,25648,2
25648,"I'm 5'2"" and 140 lb and got an XL.",25648,2
25649,"The labels - ""Veteran"" and the Vietnam service ribbon are just taped on.",25649,2
25649,Will not last.,25649,2
25650,Poor quality shirt,25650,2
25651,"While I love the look of this product, I could barely fit it over my head.",25651,2
25651,"The size was an XL, but my daughter (who wears a size small) is able to wear it and it looks like it does in the picture.",25651,2
25651,"If it came in larger sizes, I'd buy it again.",25651,2
25652,"So excited to receive....then got it, it did not fit at all!",25652,2
25652,Way to small!,25652,2
25652,I ordered my size.,25652,2
25652,Size charts need to be available precisely with product.,25652,2
25652,I don't think Ill order again from Towallmark new Women clothing.,25652,2
25653,A stone fell off the moon shaped one 2 days after I received it.,25653,2
25654,I ordered the US Medium which is what I normally wear but this shirt was much too big and baggy for my tastes.,25654,2
25654,I expected a more athletic fit.,25654,2
25654,The shirt did look well made but the sizing was off for my build.,25654,2
25655,Great fabric and look but very awkward in fit.,25655,2
25655,Must be a factory mess up.,25655,2
25655,I cut it into a shirt.,25655,2
25656,"Would have been fine, though a little large.... except they mailed me two of the same half of the bikini top.",25656,2
25656,So two right-side pieces.,25656,2
25656,"I ended up reversing one side so my left piece was inside out, and white.",25656,2
25657,The top strap broke the first time I put these shoes on.,25657,2
25657,They are to narrow and are now at the shoe repair shop to me stretched and to have the strap fixed,25657,2
25658,It did not look like what's in your display.,25658,2
25659,I love the material.,25659,2
25659,Feels great on but when I workout they slip down from the waist.,25659,2
25660,shirt is very pretty material is nice and soft however the size at a 5x it should have been big and it wasn't...,25660,2
25661,Says women's but was more like a junior's or  anorexic women's.,25661,2
25661,"Way too small for me, had to return it.",25661,2
25661,But other than that the skirt was nice.,25661,2
25662,"Cute, but they run very small!",25662,2
25663,Very cheap looking once received.,25663,2
25664,The waist does not reflect the actual size.,25664,2
25664,"We are real people out here, with real measurements!",25664,2
25665,Lycra is not like the picture,25665,2
25666,Runs very big,25666,2
25667,Wife didn't like it because of the fit.,25667,2
25668,"I wear a XXL so I got a XXL and what I found out, they run SMALL.",25668,2
25668,I feel like I'm wearing a L and I don't like is.,25668,2
25668,So next time and from now on I'm always going to look at the reviews.,25668,2
25669,"They are cute, but deffinitly not plus size !",25669,2
25670,Its a good idea but my hairties never stay on the bracelet.,25670,2
25670,they always slide off,25670,2
25671,Too small and not well made.,25671,2
25672,My son is just growing out of a 3T yet the 4T size was too small and I returned for size 6 which worked.,25672,2
25673,bottom is fine.,25673,2
25673,top has absolutely no support and is akin to tying a bandanna around your breasts.,25673,2
25673,would not buy again,25673,2
25674,The swim suit is sexy but having to re-Thread some of the side straps,25674,2
25675,Its too big,25675,2
25676,"The material, quality, and construction is all great, however I've had to buy three different pairs all the same size to get one that fit right.",25676,2
25676,"I wear a 34x30 and first pair the waist was waaay to tight, second pair waste was perfect, length was too short, and third pair fits just right.",25676,2
25676,"Love them when I find ones that fit, but easier to buy them in store so you can try on  multiple pairs",25676,2
25677,Too tight in the hips/butt.,25677,2
25677,"The dress is beautiful but to have it tailored, if I order a larger size, would cost more than I paid for it.",25677,2
25677,I ordered sz.,25677,2
25677,8.,25677,2
25677,This material has no stretch.,25677,2
25678,"it's nice but it doesn't stop in the head because is too heavy, don't worth",25678,2
25679,Was not well made....gave to Goodwill.,25679,2
25680,It fit very small.,25680,2
25680,I usually wear an XL or 1x and I ordered it in a 2x after seeing that it ran small.,25680,2
25680,No kidding.,25680,2
25680,It is way small,25680,2
25681,"THIS WAS PICTURED AND IS SUPOSE TO BE BLACK N SILVER....WELL,  MINE CAME AND HAD CHEAP LOOKING GREEN CRYSTAL THINGS IN IT!!!!!!!",25681,2
25681,YUK!!!!,25681,2
25681,I WANTED AND ORDERED SILVER N BLACK !,25681,2
25681,I WOULD MAYBE HAVE BEEN OKAY TO HAVE CLEAR OR WHITE BUT NOT GREEN .....YUK!!,25681,2
25681,LOOKS CLASSY AND ELEGANT IN PIC BUT WHAT I RECEIVED WAS PURE GAUDY GARBAGE!,25681,2
25681,SOOOO UPSET !,25681,2
25681,:(,25681,2
25682,This shirt was way to long so I had to return it.,25682,2
25683,Just don't like this at all.,25683,2
25683,"Too long, too yellow, too some thing!",25683,2
25684,I really wanted this bag to work.,25684,2
25684,The bag is a nice casual bag.,25684,2
25684,There are several pockets great for organizing.,25684,2
25684,Size and wearable-ity was really nice for an on the go diaper bag while on vacation.,25684,2
25684,"Really disappointed because the two outside side pockets were basically useless... Couldn't fit water bottle or baby bottle, and everything else would get ""trapped"" in there because my (average/petite) hand couldn't fit in to retrieve items.",25684,2
25684,Also two stars because the Velcro used to seal some pockets started coming off after 2-3 brief uses.,25684,2
25684,"Also quick return window so by the time I used the bag and came home to deal with it was out of the 30 day window, so I'm stuck with a bag I won't use again.",25684,2
25684,Bummer.,25684,2
25685,"Keep in mind that this is a JUNIORS-size brand, so you will need to order 2 sizes up from what you wear in women's.",25685,2
25685,"I normally wear a medium or large in women's, and the x-large in Body Glove fit fine.",25685,2
25685,"(I'm 5' 7"", 168 lbs with most of my extra weight in my hips and thighs.",25685,2
25685,Since I'm breast-feeding my son I'm a little bigger chested than my normal 36B.),25685,2
25685,What I didn't like about this dress is the fact that the back is not the same as the front.,25685,2
25685,It's actually open in the back with a few straps going across.,25685,2
25685,"Therefore, it showed my back fat, so I returned it.",25685,2
25686,"Looks great, sent it to my brother-in -law as a gift, he could not set it and neither could I.",25686,2
25686,"No instruction available,.",25686,2
25687,"Top way too small for an large, but style is nice",25687,2
25688,Very Cheap Quality,25688,2
25689,You get what you pay for.,25689,2
25689,Don't order this dress unless you absolutely love it.,25689,2
25689,You will pay for to have it shipped back than what you pay for the dress.,25689,2
25690,It does not fit like shown.,25690,2
25690,The neck part of this dress is not wide enough to hang off shoulder.,25690,2
25691,at the start it the fit was tight then as I ware it a few times it became loose.,25691,2
25691,So I am still hoping to show the loose of weight or inches something it has not happened so far,25691,2
25692,"A little short on me, going to wear it as a long shirt rather than a dress.",25692,2
25693,Very cheaply made!,25693,2
25693,You can see the thread coming apart around the holes by the neck.,25693,2
25693,Fits way bigger.,25693,2
25693,But it feels very comfortable.,25693,2
25694,These tongue pads did not stick even in the first hour.,25694,2
25694,"It was a challenge to peel the pads off the paper to stick them in a shoe (sandal in this case) and when I put them in my sandals, they just came unglued to quickly.",25694,2
25694,"Would not recommend these, now looking for something else from another seller.",25694,2
25695,I have tons of iHeartRaves fluffies and this is the first pair I have not been satisfied with.,25695,2
25695,The white 'fur' sheds like nobody's business and got matted really easily.,25695,2
25695,Took some fine combing to make these look OK.,25695,2
25696,way to small for the size it says,25696,2
25697,The torso on this item is too short for me.,25697,2
25697,"I'm average height (5'5"") and average weight (135), yet it is still uncomfortably short.",25697,2
25698,Pretty but cheaply made.,25698,2
25698,The back bent the first time I put them on.,25698,2
25699,"These were offered as ""full cut"".",25699,2
25699,I assumed that they were styled to be worn at the waist.,25699,2
25699,They are designed to be worn below the navel.,25699,2
25699,I probably will not look at  Hanes again.,25699,2
25700,Not windproof...at all.,25700,2
25700,It's single layer (thin) fleece with no windproof liner.,25700,2
25701,The photo looks much better than the actual product.,25701,2
25701,It's very poorly made.,25701,2
25701,"One of the pockets was sewn into the hem, the fabric is cheap looking and it runs small.",25701,2
25701,The best thing is the design.,25701,2
25701,If the construction wasn't so inferior it would be a nice piece.,25701,2
25702,Pink is alot brighter than expected,25702,2
25703,The fabric is very thin and looks faded already,25703,2
25704,Cheap material!,25704,2
25705,This shirt had a cool design hence why I bought it.,25705,2
25705,"After it arrived, I immediately noticed the front image wasn't white, but a very dark gray color.",25705,2
25705,It was like wearing a plain black t-shirt.,25705,2
25705,The material was also uncomfortable and the size was very awkward.,25705,2
25705,"Waste of money, don't buy.",25705,2
25706,Small in the chest area,25706,2
25707,"the dress was not as expected, we were very disapointed",25707,2
25708,Very shear and thin material.,25708,2
25708,Very cheap looking.,25708,2
25709,"itchy and not as long as it looks in the picture, also very thin material",25709,2
25710,Cute style but its a cheap product from Asia and does fit properly.,25710,2
25710,Don't waste your money.,25710,2
25710,Actually if you are a short petite woman then this wound be perfect.,25710,2
25710,If not don't waste your time.,25710,2
25710,It won't fit an average built woman properly.,25710,2
25711,They don't work very well with my IPhone.,25711,2
25711,I usually have to take them off to operate the phone,25711,2
25712,poor quality,25712,2
25713,Ordered a small but recd a medium.,25713,2
25713,Bottoms are still to tight while top is big.,25713,2
25713,Figure she will grow into top but bottoms way to tight.,25713,2
25713,Bought many bathing suits on Amazon & this is first one we had trouble with.,25713,2
25713,Odd sizing.,25713,2
25714,"Really cute, but size is way off.",25714,2
25714,Way too big!,25714,2
25714,!,25714,2
25715,"I'm 5'2"" 110 lbs, but a bit curvy on the bottom.",25715,2
25715,"The dress technically fit, but the skirt is just very short.",25715,2
25715,"It's short to begin with, but if I moved around it quickly rode up and got dangerously revealing.",25715,2
25716,Fit ike a juniors size small rather than a womens..,25716,2
25716,I ordered the light blue and the bottoms were see through.. size up and pick a darker color maybe?,25716,2
25717,This dress is too sheer and poor in quality.,25717,2
25718,Wasn't what I thought.,25718,2
25718,I gave it away.,25718,2
25719,Can't return so I am stuck with them,25719,2
25720,I ordered a pair of gray and navy socks.,25720,2
25720,One of the gray socks after five washes had a huge hole!,25720,2
25720,I hope the rest of the socks will be high quality without anymore defects or problems.,25720,2
25721,The front strap fell off.,25721,2
25722,Ok its not really the size its the style.,25722,2
25722,The ruffles on this dress didn't hit my curves like I thought they would.,25722,2
25722,The material was great and the quality was also good.,25722,2
25722,In the end I returned it.,25722,2
25722,I will say that I've bought other stuff from this company without any worries.,25722,2
25722,Just a style issue.,25722,2
25723,I wear an XL.,25723,2
25723,Although the package says XL this t-shirt is no more than a medium in actual size.,25723,2
25723,I am disappointed because it is really cute and different.,25723,2
25723,Two stars because I like it.,25723,2
25723,No more because the sizing is just wrong.,25723,2
25723,I won't buy this brand again.,25723,2
25724,Trash.,25724,2
25724,You can't resize the band and the Roman numeral 6 (VI) is backwards,25724,2
25725,It took a long time to ship and I was not very happy with the quality.,25725,2
25726,Not for tall girls,25726,2
25727,Not roomy enough,25727,2
25728,too tights....creates bulges around elastic at top and bottom.,25728,2
25729,beautiful necklace but i had to discard it since it was already rusted.,25729,2
25730,"Ripped second use, fit is large",25730,2
25731,"nice deep purple color, but sizing was way too small to fit.",25731,2
25732,They're very flimsy.,25732,2
25732,But I suppose you get what you pay for.,25732,2
25732,A good back up pair,25732,2
25733,I like the shirt but the sleeves r to small and it's kind of tight and I got a size up than I actrully wear.,25733,2
25734,poor quality,25734,2
25735,"The thighs and waist fit just fine, but the calves were tight and the fabric offered NO stretch at all.",25735,2
25735,"I by no means have very large calves either  - sadly, I had to return these.",25735,2
25735,"On the plus side, the fabric was very nice (aside from not having an give to it)",25735,2
25736,The description says bonded to Sherpa fleece - there was no Sherpa.,25736,2
25737,"Too small, size not accurate",25737,2
25738,OK,25738,2
25739,Was a small size for my daughter ...,25739,2
25740,Too thin and see through.,25740,2
25740,"You can't wear panties, pasties or a bra.",25740,2
25740,Everything underneath shows right through.,25740,2
25740,The darker colored outfits don't have this problem,25740,2
25741,"fit very large in the waist, I could not wear and I am 5'6"" 245 lb.",25741,2
25741,gave as a gift to my niece who is larger and they fit her,25741,2
25742,"Ok in the waist, but way too long... And I have long legs.",25742,2
25742,I usually wear a size 32/32 and bought these in a medium.,25742,2
25742,Returned them because of the length.,25742,2
25743,Just okay.,25743,2
25743,"I guess if you are the size of this model in the picture, every shirt would look great.",25743,2
25743,It fits very snug around the mid section.,25743,2
25743,It is not flattering at all.,25743,2
25743,I wear a M/L.,25743,2
25743,I ordered the large.,25743,2
25743,I don't think it would have mattered what size I got.,25743,2
25743,The material is very clingy.,25743,2
25743,"If you are a sixe 10 or over, this shirt is not for you.",25743,2
25743,"If you found this helpful, please check below.. thank you.",25743,2

25744,Very annoying .,25744,2
25745,I liked this shirt but I could not have put it over 1 arm.,25745,2
25745,Beware these are extra small sizes I gave my extra large to a woman that wears a size small!,25745,2
25746,Not close to the size,25746,2
25747,Why is the bottom absolutely huge?,25747,2
25747,It's a size s but it looks like a xl.,25747,2
25748,XXXL equals medium or a tighter large.,25748,2
25748,I cant say to much about the equality.,25748,2
25748,I was too aggravated.,25748,2
25749,It just did not look right.,25749,2
25749,Not for every body type,25749,2
25750,Not good for larger cup sizes.,25750,2
25750,"I suspect it would hold up just fine for smaller cups (A or B), but for my C/D size, it seemed to keep falling off.",25750,2
25750,"I'm not sure if it's a sticky thing, or just can't hold up the weight.",25750,2
25750,"Maybe it would work for a dress that helps hold these in place, but for my loose, backless dress, I usually opt to go bra-less instead of adjusting these all night long.",25750,2
25751,Very cheap looking.,25751,2
25751,Stones looked plastic.,25751,2
25752,"The fabric look old, and it's one piece it's not pants and shirt.",25752,2
25752,Very disappointed,25752,2
25753,"I really wanted to like this, but it's too small.",25753,2
25753,I'm 5'9 and 175lbs.,25753,2
25753,Normally wear an XL.,25753,2
25753,"I ordered the XL in this, and it barely fit me, with being too tight in the chest and arm areas.",25753,2
25753,"When I wash it, it will be unwearable.",25753,2
25753,"I can give it to my smaller friend, but wish it would have been bigger as it really is cute.",25753,2
25754,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,25754,2
25754,"Too big , different fit !",25754,2
25755,poor quality.....stiff at the top,25755,2
25756,Blah,25756,2
25757,Tight in the arms,25757,2
25758,I do like the thin material but the screen print is cheap and looks wrinked.,25758,2
25758,I would save my $.,25758,2
25759,I couldn't get over the awkward sleeves which have to be rolled up to establish normal length.,25759,2
25760,Had to return.,25760,2
25760,Did not fit and wasn't crazy about the material.,25760,2
25761,The sizing is inaccurate.,25761,2
25761,The largest size actually feels like a Medium.,25761,2
25762,Fits well and has a nice cut.,25762,2
25762,Material is pretty hard on the skin.,25762,2
25762,Creases very easily.,25762,2
25763,Hard to get it to stay on,25763,2
25764,My son wore this in a wedding.,25764,2
25764,It is cute but runs very small.,25764,2
25764,I ordered a 3t thinking he would have plenty of room (he was not yet wearing any 3t clothes).,25764,2
25764,"The suspenders would not stay together, I had to do an emergency sewing fix before the ceremony.",25764,2
25764,The clip on tie also broke before going down the isle.,25764,2
25764,I have one pic of him with everything.,25764,2
25764,It's adorrible but I would expect things to make it through at least one wearing.,25764,2
25765,"I make my purchase from Venezuela I like me no more charm fabric is super thin and is not dress as such , the presentation is nice for simple occasion .",25765,2
25765,what if I delay sending but due to express liberty box .,25765,2
25765,Annex photo,25765,2
25766,I am so sad!!!,25766,2
25766,This skirt is adorable and just like pictured... except the zipper is broken!,25766,2
25766,So it is with a heavy heart that I am returning it.,25766,2
25766,"I should have expected that for the price, but with so many good reviews I took a chance.",25766,2
25766,I hope if anyone orders this they have better luck than me.,25766,2
25766,"Other than that, the fit would have been perfect.",25766,2
25767,I have worn a 38x30 for 15 years.,25767,2
25767,"This ""30"" fit more like a 32 and I had to return.",25767,2
25767,"I also ordered ""Wrangler Men's Loose Fit Straight Leg Jean"" and was much happier with the length.",25767,2
25768,"No pockets, shorter than in the photo.",25768,2
25768,Just a plain chambray shirt.,25768,2
25768,Not really what I had ordered based on the description.,25768,2
25768,I really wanted pockets.,25768,2
25769,The neck hit me weirdly on this...,25769,2
25769,"It needed to be a deeper scoop, I think?",25769,2
25769,Or perhaps a v-neck.,25769,2
25769,"As it was, it was a crew that hit me at a weird place and the print also hit at a weird place, so it went back.",25769,2
25769,For reference I am fairly short and usually wear an XL.,25769,2
25770,"The shirt and the material were lovely, but it was too oooooooh small.",25770,2
25770,It appears that the measurements and sizes posted for clothing coming from another country are not accurate.,25770,2
25771,fabric is see through!!,25771,2
25771,!,25771,2
25772,Warm but too small,25772,2
25773,I have no complaints at all about the manufacturing or the materials.,25773,2
25773,"It all seems to be well done and with a high level of attention to detail, the material also seem to be really good, they do protect my feet and the outer sole is made of a very non-slippery material.",25773,2
25773,"However, they are way too small.",25773,2
25773,"I am a 9 even for hiking shoes, but following the guidelines in the manufacturer's website I decided to buy a size 10 for comfort.",25773,2
25773,"The shoes do have the correct length, flat length that is, but they are supposed to be snug and so when you wear them the leather has to cover the curved volume of a foot and my big toe reaches the front end of the shoe.",25773,2
25773,"If I wear no socks, my feet slip and landing after a front flip can get really painful.",25773,2
25773,"Of course, I noticed this after I wore them once and there is no way to return them unless they are in perfect, unused condition.",25773,2
25774,Extremely cute but the fabric got cot and then tore at the dress so now I have lines from missing threads which ruins the dress.,25774,2
25774,If the dress was a different material I think it would make the dress perfect.,25774,2
25775,The suit ran small and was extremely see through around the bottom.,25775,2
25775,If they would put extra lining for the bottoms it may have been ok.,25775,2
25776,Looks nice but broke in the first 30 days.,25776,2
25776,Returned to amazon for refund.,25776,2
25777,returned.,25777,2
25777,way too long.,25777,2
25777,but the top worked out great,25777,2
25778,"very cheap stones, nothing like the picture.",25778,2
25778,the turquoise one arrived loose and the stone will likely fall out the first time I wear it.,25778,2
25779,Looks a lot cheaper than it does in the picture and doesn't fit for my faith piercing.,25779,2
25779,Is too big for the inside of my ear,25779,2
25780,The posts arrived bent and they are flimsy,25780,2
25781,Not what I expected...and it's super stiff.,25781,2
25782,The shirt was smaller than expected first of all.,25782,2
25782,"Second, the white logo feels very cheap and you can tell it was cheaply ironed into the shirt.",25782,2
25782,And you can feel the logo on the inside of the shirt.,25782,2
25782,It's almost unwearable because it rubs your skin.,25782,2
25782,It says it's a Disney brand shirt but it's definitely not.,25782,2
25782,It's a cheap shirt with a cheap ironed on logo feel.,25782,2
25782,Def not a Disney brand shirt.,25782,2
25782,Don't waste your time on this one!,25782,2
25782,!,25782,2
25783,Cute but too small and too short,25783,2
25784,Its really cute.,25784,2
25784,But the elastic at the bottom is insanely tight.,25784,2
25785,Bad quality,25785,2
25786,"Not as vibrant,..wish it had more colour .was a bit disappointed .",25786,2
25787,we had to return this... there were not enough holes in it... his other belt of the same size had the correct amount of holes.,25787,2
25788,"Really like the size, weight & style but lost 2 stones within 12 hours of receiving it.",25788,2
25788,One from the top and one from the front.,25788,2
25789,"Very thin and see threw, cheap looking... will never order again... Hard time trying to return it.",25789,2
25790,"they're quite uncomfortable/kinda painful to wear, eventually I just took my lip piercings out and let them seal up because it was a lot less uncomfortable.",25790,2
25791,Already breaking after a month.,25791,2
25791,"Phone slips out, button gets stuck, not as bright.",25791,2
25791,Best spend more money & get the real Lumee case!,25791,2
25791,!,25791,2
25792,My significant other was dissatisfied with sizing he generally is a large up sized to XL and felt it was form fitting yet appreciated re color,25792,2
25793,Very cheaply made and really tiny.,25793,2
25794,"Not fabric I suspected , look like a power ranger",25794,2
25795,Disappointed with quality,25795,2
25796,Small and cheaply made.,25796,2
25797,"cheap, funky smell, and the fringe is off on it, the neck hole is the size of an arm hole!",25797,2
25797,not warm and cozy like it looks.,25797,2
25797,Looks more like a rag.,25797,2
25798,This is a cute outfit in the pic.,25798,2
25798,But poor quality in person.,25798,2
25798,Cheaply made and runs very small.,25798,2
25799,The chain broke immediately.,25799,2
25799,Tried to fix it but it kept on breaking.,25799,2
25799,Overall it comes across as pretty cheap.,25799,2
25800,This material was just weird...it felt like cheesecloth!,25800,2
25800,But it *looked* fine.,25800,2
25800,I did order my normal size and it was waay too small...another donation to my tiniest sister and she loves it (except the strange feel!,25800,2
25800,).,25800,2
25801,Not worth $80 - more like $20.,25801,2
25801,Also disappointing because it has a red line down the center.,25801,2
25802,The bag is beautiful and is a good size.,25802,2
25802,"Unfortunately, the strap broke immediately upon hooking it into the attached loops and trying it on.",25802,2
25802,"The clip broke off of the attachment to the rest of the strap on one side, and you can see that clip portion in the picture.",25802,2
25802,"The loop straps are too small to use alone, so the bag is useless without functioning straps.",25802,2
25802,"I was looking forward to using the bag, but unfortunately it's too poorly made.",25802,2
25802,"I have requested a return, but have not received a response.",25802,2
25802,Depending on how that goes I will be able to also rate the seller at a later date.,25802,2
25802,"Shipping took a long time, which is another negative.",25802,2
25802,I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the bag looks nice.,25802,2
25803,The color is much lighter and not happy with the material.,25803,2
25803,More lycra feel than expected.,25803,2
25804,"I purchased a medium, however it seemed to run big as I needed to re-purchase in the small size.",25804,2
25804,Overall I do like the dress but just in a smaller size.,25804,2
25805,"Not what expected....very thin, the stones practically invisible, like there is no stones at all, the necklace itself  barely noticeable;
Also, I had a really hard time to lock it.. Not worth the money !",25805,2
25806,Fits and looks fine but the Jacket is lighter weight than I expected.,25806,2
25806,Is fine for rain/ moderate weather but I am returning it because the zipper doesn't work.,25806,2
25807,Made my hips look big.,25807,2
25808,Good lord these are HUGE!,25808,2
25808,I am 5 7 and 150 and these Mediums fit like a baggy sandwich.,25808,2
25808,Go two or three sizes down what you usually wear in compression shirts.,25808,2
25809,Way to small could have been two sizes bigger.,25809,2
25810,"The fit of these capris are great, but I'm sad to say they did not pass the ""bend over"" test.",25810,2
25810,I have a small waist but large butt and thighs.,25810,2
25810,"So, in order for my workout pants to fit well in the waist and not slip down I order medium.",25810,2
25810,"(I am 5' 2"" 157lbs) I have trouble finding ones that are not see through when I bend over because of this.",25810,2
25810,Sadly I returned them.,25810,2
25811,The string part in the back is not appealing to me in person,25811,2
25812,"I was disappointed with this dress, the bust i way to big for the size of the dress.",25812,2
25812,"I bought a size based on my measurements (34B, 28, 38) and it was huge up top, i bought 2 (in different colors) the fit was different in both dresses and the colors were not as described.",25812,2
25812,"The manufacturer refused to take them back, so now i have 2 dresses that do not fit and were the wrong color that i have to either sell, or donate to a high school and hopefully someone will fit them.",25812,2
25813,Bought this for niece.,25813,2
25813,The earrings were not very good quality.,25813,2
25813,Would have been better off purchasing these at the store.,25813,2
25814,"Okay, This was very cute but WAY too small.",25814,2
25814,I gave the size Lg to my daughter who wear a size small and it fit her.,25814,2
25815,A bit cheap looking,25815,2
25816,Broke the same week,25816,2
25817,"My bf hates this shirt, it is short and comes up like a womans shirt.",25817,2
25817,DO NOT BUY unless you have a skinny small torso,25817,2
25818,Be aware that the sleeves on this shirt are very short.,25818,2
25818,The shirt fits small.,25818,2
25819,These did look nice but unfortunately the product quality was not great.,25819,2
25819,They ripped on the first workout.,25819,2
25820,"For a larger breast size, the cup did not cover and was not very supportive.",25820,2
25820,The underwire was not snug to the body.,25820,2
25820,"The top of the cup is not sewn onto the strap, therefore the weight of the breast pulls it down the strap.",25820,2
25820,Was disappointed because I really liked the colors and design.,25820,2
25820,Returning the product.,25820,2
25820,#bigboobprob,25820,2
25821,When it arrived it was ripped on the sleeve about half inch hole.,25821,2
25821,I was very dissappointed in quality .,25821,2
25821,My money was wasted .,25821,2
25821,Totally unfair.,25821,2
25822,Way too big.,25822,2
25823,Nice tie clip but lost it the first night I wore it because it slipped off.,25823,2
25824,This purse looks and feels very cheap,25824,2
25825,Very cheaply made.,25825,2
25825,Also very transparent and the holes in knitting are much larger then they appear.,25825,2
25825,You can see right through the hat.,25825,2
25825,Not impressed especially for the price.,25825,2
25826,Didn't fit like the photos,25826,2
25827,Cheap materials.,25827,2
25827,The fabric sheds red and white all over.,25827,2
25828,Larger that expected.,25828,2
25828,Disappointed.,25828,2
25828,Too big for neck,25828,2
25829,Weird fit.,25829,2
25829,"Too big on the bottom, too small on top.",25829,2
25829,The mocha-gray color look brown-beige.,25829,2
25830,The socks dont't come up past the knee as pictured.,25830,2
25831,"They look attractive on photos, but the metal appeared to be slightly bended inside and the item's overall quality didn't meet my standards.",25831,2
25831,It is appropriate for beginners or for practice purposes.,25831,2
25832,Nah...,25832,2
25832,I don't like it.,25832,2
25833,"Cute pattern, but way too small despite ordering an XXL!",25833,2
25833,"I knew it would be sheer, so that was no surprise.",25833,2
25833,I will be giving this to a child to wear.,25833,2
25834,Not what I expected.,25834,2
25835,It's very fragile & smaller than it looks.,25835,2
25835,It broke before I could get it out of the package & the clasps get stuck in your hair.,25835,2
25835,It looks nice but didn't even get to wear it.,25835,2
25835,Needs to be sturdier.,25835,2
25836,This is sheer.,25836,2
25836,Completely sheer.,25836,2
25836,In going to have to wear a full outfit underneath it in order to even wear it.,25836,2
25837,just get the real thing,25837,2
25838,The dress itself is pretty but I hate when you can tell it wasn't well made.,25838,2
25838,I just received mine today and the zipper got stuck then completely broke the first try going up without it even being on me.,25838,2
25838,If the wedding weren't so soon I would definitely return this dress.,25838,2
25839,"The rings have a great design, but tarnish very quickly.",25839,2
25840,Not very happy at all I purchased these sun glasses and when they came they were fine but after a month of just regularly folding the frame from open to close the frame started to bend.,25840,2
25840,Not the best pair I have ever bought,25840,2
25841,The design and the material of the blouse was ok.,25841,2
25841,It just fit way too small my boobs could not fit,25841,2
25842,Nothing like the photo,25842,2
25843,Not at all like the pic cheap China rip off version don't waste your money,25843,2
25844,Love the purse.,25844,2
25844,Unfortunately the short handle strap broke after only a few weeks.,25844,2
25845,Ok so I COMPLETLEY got the wrong size.,25845,2
25845,I ordered a large.,25845,2
25845,And I usually wear a small so I ordered a size up.,25845,2
25845,But an XXL CAME.,25845,2
25845,It fit though which is weird.,25845,2
25845,"So if your a medium, order an XXL!",25845,2
25845,Just a warning.,25845,2
25845,Also it's kinda ugly...,25845,2
25846,Stayed on all of 10 minutes.,25846,2
25847,Hurt so bad and do not sit on the ear like the pic.,25847,2
25847,They dangle making your ear hole irritated :(,25847,2
25848,Smaller than expected!!!,25848,2
25848,Not as good as on the picture.,25848,2
25849,Bottoms are way too small!!,25849,2
25849,Order the top at least two sizes up.,25849,2
25850,Nice shorts but they described as 3X or 2X US but they were more like a large US,25850,2
25851,"I got these but pair do not match, one is bigger than the other.",25851,2
25852,Fits rather small for the size it says it is.,25852,2
25853,This seems to be a quality product however it's too generous in the size and much too heavy to be worn any time other than during cold weather.,25853,2
25854,Wayyy too small and threads were showing all over the elbow patches.,25854,2
25854,Very cheap looking.,25854,2
25855,Thin fabric...... No happy.,25855,2
25856,Too big for me,25856,2
25857,"They were cute, but they fell apart quite easily, didn't even last a few weeks before they started to look old.",25857,2
25858,Cute outfit but I ordered a size up (9 month) the pants are way to big (they fit my firends 2 year old) and the shirt barely fits my 4 month old.,25858,2
25859,The cups in the bra are unusually small.,25859,2
25859,Didn't fit.,25859,2
25860,Too small,25860,2
25861,These are just too thick to fit inside any of my shoes without creating the kind of friction that causes bunions.,25861,2
25861,I can't really use these.,25861,2
25862,Poor quality.,25862,2
25862,Ordered the polka dot bag and you could see the outline of polka dots of the inside liner from the outside.,25862,2
25863,Runs way way small,25863,2
25864,leaks when filling,25864,2
25865,Design of the dress is very nice but the fabric is some what itchy and the color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture.,25865,2
25865,Rather than a royal blue as pictured the blue is paler and the fabric does not have any gloss/shine to it.,25865,2
25865,It will require lots of accessories to liven it up.,25865,2
25866,"Did not like the cloth feeling, the length or the general aspect.",25866,2
25867,I was so excited to find this in my size that it was a total let down when i got it.,25867,2
25867,I couldn't even get my head in : (,25867,2
25868,"I missed it in the (accurate) description, but the heart is very tiny, not much larger than the links of chain and almost invisible",25868,2
25869,"I wear these in my ankle booties, and they do not stay on my feet.",25869,2
25869,They just slide off the back of my foot.,25869,2
25870,"Very small for ""men's"" one size fits all.",25870,2
25871,These are not boot socks.,25871,2
25871,They are very thin and too big for my feet.,25871,2
25871,I wear size 5.,25871,2
25871,They'd be best for an 8 but not a 5.,25871,2
25871,If you're looking for warmth look elsewhere,25871,2
25872,"medium size order, I get so large that frightens was supposed medium size, is a big disappointment what I've been",25872,2
25873,"Very sheer fabric, I would only wear under a dress or very long shirt.",25873,2
25874,Didn't like fit too large I ordered small  color not as expected,25874,2
25875,To small,25875,2
25876,Small in the chest.,25876,2
25876,"I'm a little more ""gifted"" than the average woman (36 D), But this dress had no room for my lady lumps.",25876,2
25876,I don't think that the designer had in mind that women have sacks of fat tissue.,25876,2
25876,If you have an A cup you can wear this dress.,25876,2
25876,If you have anything larger don't waste your time or money buying this.,25876,2
25877,"very comfortable, but SEE THROUGH!",25877,2
25877,Anyone that says these aren't see through didn't bend over in them.,25877,2
25877,"I want pants to work out in, squats and lunges would be out of the question in these pants.",25877,2
25878,Shoulder cut out is a very small circle nothing like the photo,25878,2
25879,This shirt came huge.,25879,2
25879,Not sure if the tag was incorrect but it fit my husband like a 2lx when he's only a large.,25879,2
25880,was a very small and doesn't look like the picture,25880,2
25881,"It looks good in the picture
Poor quality and very small",25881,2
25882,Good fabric.,25882,2
25882,Lovely design.,25882,2
25882,"Fits like a shirt not a dress and i am 5' 2 ""
Should be longer",25882,2
25883,"These are very cute, but way too small!",25883,2
25883,I ordered an XL and this is probably closer to a size medium.,25883,2
25883,"The material looks and feels nice, but the size is an issue for me.",25883,2
25884,Way too small,25884,2
25885,I would not buy this item again even though it is cute!,25885,2
25885,its not exactly like the picture!,25885,2
25885,its really different and the clips that hold your stocking are really cheap and broke before I could finish dressing!,25885,2
25885,This is a great idea but the details are what will make you think twice about buying it.,25885,2
25886,"not great quality, kind of shapeless and took forever to receive",25886,2
25887,"Not comfortable, I consider myself pretty fit but it is very tight on my upper arm.",25887,2
25888,The set is a good value even though the shirt is no fit .,25888,2
25888,"I bought my man's regular shirt size and the collar barely fits bit the shirt itself is so large it looks like he is wearing a balloon , it is very very large .",25888,2
25888,"The rest fits ok and is of decent quality , not fantastic, but ok .",25888,2
25888,"And it's still a good price for everything without a shirt, so I was considering to keep it at first and just get a different shirt.",25888,2
25888,Returned in the end in exchange for a different set and a separate shirt.,25888,2
25889,Measure yourself!,25889,2
25889,I got a large.,25889,2
25889,"I'm 4""11 and 110 and these were still too small.",25889,2
25889,I try to wear them but it's awkward.,25889,2
25889,I'm disappointed but this is a China product so it's always a risk.,25889,2
25890,"It's pretty, but can't find a way to put in a picture for the gift.",25890,2
25890,Locket is a holder for a photo...how do you get a photo in the thing!!,25890,2
25890,!,25890,2
25891,Cool design but would not work for what I intended which was outdoors hiking and camping.,25891,2
25891,"More of a fashion pant than a true technical pant, but had to see them to know.",25891,2
25891,Mesh knees gave them breathability but I doubt durability.,25891,2
25891,"Great stretching material for the rest of the pant, gives ease of movement.",25891,2
25891,Zippers look like they would be water resistant and that would have been a good thing.,25891,2
25891,"Fit was good, except the length was far too long for a 5'5"" person.",25891,2
25891,So I returned them.,25891,2
25892,"too small and has no stretch to it,
washed it so i could wear it and the white dulled",25892,2
25893,"The material on the upper torso is too thick and the fit is weird, I tailor it by cutting the under skirt and the under sleeves, it is ok but still not a good item.",25893,2
25894,This is a very odd fit for larger girls...,25894,2
25894,Very small in some areas and a tent in others.,25894,2
25894,I think the design is meant for smaller sizes,25894,2
25895,I do not like the elastic type hem of this top.,25895,2
25895,not at all what I expected.,25895,2
25895,However it is pretty,25895,2
25896,Nice looking purse!!,25896,2
25896,"I like love the color and it arrive on time, however it is made of a very cheap fabric and smells really bad.",25896,2
25896,"I haven't use it, I put it in my basement and I put a fabric softener inside of it to let the bad odor go away.",25896,2
25896,"But for the price I paid
for it I guess shouldn't complain but I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this product unless they like cheap stuff!",25896,2
25896,!.,25896,2
25897,Sadly fake a costume looking.,25897,2
25897,Not worth getting honestly.,25897,2
25898,"Kinda see-though, very long, a small was much too big and I'm 5'4"" size 2",25898,2
25899,Very cheap.,25899,2
25899,Not nearly as vibrant in color.,25899,2
25900,Sizing,25900,2
25901,It feels like a costume dress.,25901,2
25901,Its very thin and cheap.,25901,2
25902,"Cute necklace, chain broke with in two days of wearing it though.",25902,2
25903,Its a nice top but didn't fit as expected.,25903,2
25903,I got a size medium like a regularly do but it seems like a small to me.,25903,2
25904,I was nervous to purchase this in one size fits all and I should have been.,25904,2
25904,"It fit ok, and I honestly could have gotten away with it, but it was just a little too tight and the straps on the back were hard to situate to look like the model.",25904,2
25904,"I would say that if you are very petite and a D, it would fit, but if you have any meat on you, its not going to look right.",25904,2
25904,Its mainly made for B/C sized breasts.,25904,2
25905,To small,25905,2
25906,"Are nice, but too fragile... Do not seat on it or drop it, you'll lose them.",25906,2
25906,"Definitely, you get what you pay.",25906,2
25907,Fits on the smaller side & the material feels cheap,25907,2
25908,"The shield is definitely too small, and I wouldn't have even minded that much if I could just wear the rose gold barbell, but even that didn't work out because the rose plating faded and turned after like 3 days",25908,2
25909,In the photo looks like a silky material - well it's not - it's stiff as a board!,25909,2
25910,This outfit made me look like a wrestler from the 80's.,25910,2
25910,O have to return it.,25910,2
25910,It felt like nice material but did not look good on me.,25910,2
25910,It stopped midway down my thighs.,25910,2
25910,So if you do not have a body like the model i wouldnt buy it.,25910,2
25910,Maybe a smaller size .,25910,2
25911,I have owned this shirt for 3 months now and I was initially impressed.,25911,2
25911,The shirt is amazingly soft even when compared to other merino wool products.,25911,2
25911,I've used it running a few times and as a base layer on light hiking trips.,25911,2
25911,As instructed I have only air dried this shirt.,25911,2
25911,Now I can see now the lesser quality that made the shirt less expensive.,25911,2
25911,There are multiple noticeable small pea-sized holes developing in random spots on the front and back.,25911,2
25911,I recommend spending a little more money for a shirt that will last.,25911,2
25911,This one will not.,25911,2
25912,"flimsy, you get what you pa for.",25912,2
25913,Nice but run 2 sizes to large.,25913,2
25914,I ordered gold and got rose gold and they were smaller than pictured and didn't fit the ear.,25914,2
25914,"They aren't necessarily super ugly, or garbage, but they aren't what's advertised.",25914,2
25915,way too small,25915,2
25916,"a 3X will fit an extra large, not a 3X
It is very cute though",25916,2
25917,cute but gave away.,25917,2
25917,Size 6 US and way too small by at least 2 sizes US.,25917,2
25918,These pant extenders were a bit of a shot in the dark.,25918,2
25918,I was looking for anything to help with the beginning stages of growing because my lower stomach was soar.,25918,2
25918,"These were way to big to help, so far I have used them once.",25918,2
25918,They slip off the button and I'm constantly checking my pants.,25918,2
25918,Not what i wanted to do all day.,25918,2
25919,the shorts run small and the sleeve for your member is very small.,25919,2
25920,material not as expected and size not what was ordered.,25920,2
25921,Small.,25921,2
25921,And not exact,25921,2
25922,Ran small.,25922,2
25922,I'm normally a size 6-8.,25922,2
25922,I ordered a medium but should have ordered a large.,25922,2
25922,Arrived smelling like cigarettes.,25922,2
25922,Fabric feels and looks cheap.,25922,2
25923,"Ok, but not as heavy as I'd anticipated.",25923,2
25923,Hollow on the inside and simulated diamonds are not as brilliant in person as photo.,25923,2
25923,Quality equivalent to money paid.,25923,2
25924,To everyone saying it's a great belt I wonder if they got the same belt I did.,25924,2
25924,The belt is to thin like others have stated.,25924,2
25924,I've had the belt for a month now and soon as I tighten the belt within minutes I'm in need of tightening it again.,25924,2
25924,"Save your money and look else where is my reccomendation, wish I did as I'm now looking for a better one.",25924,2
25925,too short for a medium,25925,2
25926,Too much like leggings rather than capri,25926,2
25927,Small,25927,2
25928,The logo began to crack and chip off after like a week.... Not really worth it.,25928,2
25929,Very plain looking.,25929,2
25929,"Looks great on the page, but not so great up close and personal.",25929,2
25930,The costume is NOT the same as the picture.,25930,2
25930,"The costume sits high in the waist, not the hips.",25930,2
25930,Also the skirt looks puffed out and does not look at all as the picture.,25930,2
25930,The belt looks cheap compared to the picture and she is not wearing the boot covers.,25930,2
25930,The picture is misleading.,25930,2
25930,Very disappointed.,25930,2
25930,The accessories and quality is adequate for what I paid.,25930,2
25930,I purchased nicer cuffs and the boots in my picture I also purchased.,25930,2
25930,The dress fits nothing like the picture and does not look nice.,25930,2
25931,I had to return this because it was sewn wrong on the sleeve and looked strange!,25931,2
25931,"For as much as this shirt cost, I expected more!",25931,2
25932,"The top I got is a different cut than the one in the picture, which is disappointing.",25932,2
25932,"(The pointy section above her left boob isn't on mine, and the strap is different too.)",25932,2
25932,"The fit is also a little weird, with extra loose fabric in some parts.",25932,2
25932,"Despite these disappointments it's still a very interesting top, and I'm considering keeping it anyway.",25932,2
25933,"Nice thick material, but the overall fit was just weird",25933,2
25934,The quality is not  as expected.,25934,2
25934,I will return back to the seller.,25934,2
25935,Dress did not fit as expected and returning it was difficult.,25935,2
25935,BEWARE - this dress comes from China and returning it was a challenge.,25935,2
25936,"I am a plus size woman, I wear a 40D bra and size 18 jeans.",25936,2
25936,I ordered the 3XL - according to the sizing chart this should have fit.,25936,2
25936,I did measure myself with a tape before I ordered.,25936,2
25936,I did manage to get the bra top on.,25936,2
25936,"It is a very stiff foam push up bra style, like when you take it off, it still holds the same shape even though it's empty.",25936,2
25936,The clasp at the back is very complicated and plastic.,25936,2
25936,"I had a really, REALLY, hard time getting it on, you can only slide it from the left from the top at an angle, and it's difficult to do behind your back.",25936,2
25936,I did not feel like this clasp would last very long.,25936,2
25936,The bottoms I did not even get past my knees.,25936,2
25936,"If you are the kind of person who has extremely skinny legs, and you carry your weight in your stomach, these bottoms maybe - maybe might fit you.",25936,2
25936,"However, it wasn't even close to fitting me.",25936,2
25936,I also noticed that the stitching was ripped in places on the suit before I tried it on.,25936,2
25936,"I don't know if it is because someone else had tried it on and had returned it, or because it was made poorly.",25936,2
25936,"Either way, I do not recommend this suit or this brand.",25936,2
25937,To small,25937,2
25938,Sized wrong,25938,2
25939,Only bought cause the YouTube video is funny.,25939,2
25939,Overall it's cheap the string fell out as soon as I picked it up.,25939,2
25939,You get what you pay for,25939,2
25940,Cup size to large fits good every where else,25940,2
25941,Too bulkey in the wrist with metal links that snag,25941,2
25942,"I reallly liked the design but  I'm a large size female even when I purchased the large size in this top it didn't even go down past my beast becuase it was too small for me, If you're petite you'll like it but if you wear a size large don't waste your money",25942,2
25943,Came tangled in the bag and the ring broke while trying to untangle the chain.,25943,2
25944,Narrow for the 22mm spread.,25944,2
25945,I was surprised when I first see the wallet.,25945,2
25945,"The threading in the words that spelled ""Bad Motherf_cker"" is in BRIGHT BLUE, which looks crappy on the brown wallet.",25945,2
25945,I was expecting black like in the photos and movie.,25945,2
25945,"Also, there are stitch lines across all letters, meaning that every row of letters are stitched in one go.",25945,2
25945,"Extremely lazy work on the letters, it may be the same for the workmanship on the rest of the wallet.",25945,2
25946,They look cute but are so tight.,25946,2
25946,I usually wear a 12 in pants and the XXL was still way too small.,25946,2
25947,the material is really cheap... horrible quality,25947,2
25948,"beautiful, but had to return because a stone was missing.",25948,2
25949,"I'm 5 3 i weigh about 140,i do not have a big chest or a very long torso,the swim dress is to short in the torso area,and there is no support in the chest area at all,if you have a big chest you will be hanging out of this bathing suit,that's if you can get the top to come up that far.",25949,2
25949,It would be such a nice swim dress if there were more support on top.,25949,2
25950,"sorry to say, i had to return this outfit.",25950,2
25950,The material seemed as if it would stretch out easily and would not retain its shape after a few hours.,25950,2
25951,I was very excited to receive this item.,25951,2
25951,Then it broke the first time I wore it.,25951,2
25951,It came apart  and keeps coming apart.,25951,2
25952,"I ordered two different colors in the same size (XL), and the sizing was very inconsistent.",25952,2
25952,"The burgundy was too small throughout, and the blue was just baggy and 3 inches longer than the burgundy.",25952,2
25952,I returned both.,25952,2
25953,It really has the potential to be a pretty blouse.,25953,2
25953,"However, the botton that connects the straps in the back of the neck area came off while trying to connect the fabric.",25953,2
25953,And there were a few loose strings I had to cut off.,25953,2
25953,The blouse itself was a bit bigger than expected.,25953,2
25953,"I normally wear a small, but I ordered a medium based on the chart.",25953,2
25953,It was too big in the waist area.,25953,2
25953,I'll have to see if I can take it in and sew the back together.,25953,2
25953,"If not, I'll have to trash it....",25953,2
25954,Cheap and was a different color.,25954,2
25954,Tarnished within weeks.,25954,2
25955,it is not made of cotton.,25955,2
25955,it's more like a swimming cap.,25955,2
25955,Too big for a newborn.,25955,2
25955,fits my 21 month old,25955,2
25956,Not at all what it looks like in picture.,25956,2
25956,Different style all together.,25956,2
25956,Extremely slow international shipping.,25956,2
25957,They seem to have separated these products into the ripped ones and the plain ones.,25957,2
25957,"When I originally purchased this, they were all under the same listing.",25957,2
25957,"I purchased #5, Coffee Ripped, and #1, Black and grey striped.",25957,2
25957,I love the black and grey striped.,25957,2
25957,Really cute and comfy.,25957,2
25957,"This one, while looking cute, is not as good.",25957,2
25957,"The material is thicker, and there is almost this felt type lining on the inside of the Ripped style hats.",25957,2
25957,"Because of that, the hat appears bulkier, and also makes it warmer to wear.",25957,2
25957,The ripped hats are not as good all around as the plain and striped hats from this same company.,25957,2
25957,LOVED THE STRIPED ONES.,25957,2
25957,And will be buying more of those.,25957,2
25957,But I will not buy any more of the ripped ones.,25957,2
25957,Has nothing to do with quality.,25957,2
25957,The quality of the ripped style hats is great.,25957,2
25957,Just the thickness and material used in comparison to their other style hats is not the same.,25957,2
25958,wrong color..,25958,2
25959,"Buy you size, i ordered a large and it was really big when i should have ordered a medium.",25959,2
25959,Material too flimsy.,25959,2
25960,"Shirt is cute, but was to short without any give.",25960,2
25960,I returned it.,25960,2
25961,Very very very thin material and stretched out long ways.,25961,2
25962,These are just cute.,25962,2
25962,They are not comfortable.,25962,2
25962,I bout them to wear with a summer jumpsuit.,25962,2
25962,Take another pair of flip flops with you because you will not be able to wear these things for too long.,25962,2
25963,Sizes run very big!,25963,2
25963,"Material and quality definitely not what I expected but oh well,  I would not buy it again, definitely NOT.",25963,2
25964,"Well, I took a chance on this one, but it turned out to not really be my thing.",25964,2
25964,"For starters, I'm not really keen on clothes that require assistance to get into; I am, of course, referring to the two ties in the back.",25964,2
25964,(Trying to tie them in the front and then maneuvering them around was almost impossible.),25964,2
25964,"I'm 5'5"" and I ordered the small.",25964,2
25964,"I am very disappointed that it fits too large on me, particularly in the back, which I don't like because it presents an exaggerated large posterior, which is not too flattering on me.",25964,2
25964,"And then there's the colors and the patterns, which are described as ""ethnic.""",25964,2
25964,"I guess that's supposed to allude to an exotic, island look, but in reality, it just looks kind of weird.",25964,2
25964,"I tried to return the dress, but since it ships from China, I received only a partial refund.",25964,2
25964,"And now, I'm left trying to think up ways to make this look good on me.",25964,2
25964,Safety pins ahoy!,25964,2
25964,2 stars.,25964,2
25965,Too small.,25965,2
25965,Painful to remove.,25965,2
25966,TINY.,25966,2
25966,Not as cute as photo.,25966,2
25966,"Strange material, almost looks like spandex, elbow patches are too high.",25966,2
25966,You get what you pay for here.,25966,2
25967,PU Leather!,25967,2
25967,Ha!,25967,2
25967,Boy they aren't kidding.,25967,2
25967,I like the bag.,25967,2
25967,Got it for my sister.,25967,2
25967,But man!,25967,2
25967,The smell is so gross.,25967,2
25967,Seller offered me 1/2 price back.,25967,2
25967,I agreed because it would have cost an arm & leg to return to China.,25967,2
25967,(Learned that the hard way with another item),25967,2
25968,The quality is poor if you don't wear something underneath the dress the underwear is shown.. colors are nice.,25968,2
25968,Not worth it to buy,25968,2
25969,Very pretty print but it is just too small got 3X but is more a large or medium.,25969,2
25969,Sending back.,25969,2
25970,"I ordered size XL, I normally wear L, but this was still short, otherwise its not that bad",25970,2
25971,cheap,25971,2
25972,Too small and not comfy at all at the toes area ate too tight.,25972,2
25973,Go two sizes smaller than what you are to get a good fit,25973,2
25974,"The skirt is way too small u_u it feels like  skirt for US size small or if you try hard enough, a medium.",25974,2
25974,I bought XL and it felt like the shirt was also a size small or medium for womens.,25974,2
25974,"The quality of the shirt is like a Tshirt and it's stretchy and kind of transparent, so you should wear something underneath.",25974,2
25974,The fabric is pretty cheap and the stiching is kind of poorly done too.,25974,2
25975,Was hoping to find a cute romper for my daughter.,25975,2
25975,This definitely did not fit her correctly.,25975,2
25975,"She doesn't have a particularly long torso, but this romper was far too short for her torso.",25975,2
25975,The shorts portion fit well and were as expected.,25975,2
25975,We will be returning to find something that fits correctly.,25975,2
25976,"Zipper broke on the second time I put the skirt on;(
Very badly made!!!",25976,2
25976,!,25976,2
25977,"Nice fabric, it would fit a small lady nicely.",25977,2
25978,very short on the torso :(,25978,2
25979,does not look like the pictures ordered a large seeing as I am 5'3 170 it looks like a night gown while wearing it..,25979,2
25980,There was a flaw in the neckline.,25980,2
25981,They are not shiney at all and smaller than I thought.,25981,2
25982,The print is so faded and pale---nothing close to the picture depicted--and the size runs small--thank goodness I bought him the larger size to be safe.....very disappointed--but not worth returning since shipping would cost more than it is worth--lesson learned,25982,2
25983,It is a good necklace for a huge fan like me.,25983,2
25983,Only issue is that it does not look like the image shown.,25983,2
25983,"It has an extra ""loop"" I suppose you could call it.",25983,2
25983,"Again I still love the necklace, but I avoided other listings of it for that reason so.....I also don't really like it I guess.",25983,2
25984,Not what I was expecting.,25984,2
25984,Won't ever wear it.,25984,2
25985,I love the color and the material but it was not big enough.,25985,2
25985,The size said XL us but it fits more like a medium.,25985,2
25986,the material is much thinner than it seems in the picture.,25986,2
25987,This shirt does not fit at all like it shows on the model.,25987,2
25987,I'm 5'6 and this was more like a bikini top.,25987,2
25988,didn't look anything like the picture.,25988,2
25988,It was like a bathing suit top.,25988,2
25988,and it was super small.,25988,2
25988,I returned it.,25988,2
25989,It's really pretty and im sure it would look cute but I can't get it in.,25989,2
25989,The little bar that you slide through the hole won't stay still.,25989,2
25989,I'll go to put it in and the little bar will just flip in another direction.,25989,2
25990,"Returned it, its a bit too short.",25990,2
25991,Ok just ok not good not bad.,25991,2
25991,Boring and to short good for the short squat woman not for the tall thin female.,25991,2
25991,I'd return it but i gave it to my short fat nurse.,25991,2
25991,She dug it .,25991,2
25991,"MY RECOMMENDATION  AT YOUR OWN RISK

25993,"I'm 5,5' and ordered a large",25993,2
25994,"The sweater itself is really cute and I liked it, but I ordered an XL.",25994,2
25994,It was so small that it fit my mother who is all of 117lbs.,25994,2
25995,Use a better quality fabric your design is acceptable .,25995,2
25995,"People like to be comfy on their clothes your is seethrou ok to b
Pay more and be happy wearing your clothes",25995,2
25996,I loved the blouse but way too small in the upper arm part for me.,25996,2
25996,The rest fit fine but had to return because of this.,25996,2
25997,WAY smaller than expected.,25997,2
25997,XL was more like a medium.,25997,2
25998,"Ok lenses and good looks, but you get what you pay for.",25998,2
25998,"Screws at hinges go into plastic, easily break.",25998,2
25999,Didn't realize this was two pieces and both fit VERY small.,25999,2
26000,"The top fit, the measurements for the bottom were inaccurate, and it's too big.",26000,2
26001,i just bought this and the top won't unscrew.,26001,2
26002,looks beautiful but its so big,26002,2
26003,The main reason I ordered this pair was the rhinestone finish in the middle.,26003,2
26003,I was disappointed to open my package and see that there was a missing stone in the middle.,26003,2
26003,Even more disappointed to realize it wasn't in the bag either so it was sent off defected to begin with.,26003,2
26004,Arm band too big,26004,2
26005,Mesh on the arms rips very easy.,26005,2
26005,Not good material.,26005,2
26005,Shirt looks baggy and not flattering.,26005,2
26005,Wore it 3 times then threw it away.,26005,2
26006,I gave these only two stars because I do like that they are small and look good.,26006,2
26006,The downfall is that I can no longer wear them because they irritate my nose and started to cause an infection.,26006,2
26006,"My skin is sensitive to certain metals, but if yours is not then you should be fine.",26006,2
26007,"Shiny spandex, too small & is not a true high waist.",26007,2
26007,I will donate it.,26007,2
26008,Nice shirt but a XL is barely a med.,26008,2
26008,Went to return today but to ship shirt back to China it's $14 minimum to ship.,26008,2
26008,Free return is not so free.,26008,2
26009,Shoulders are way to big!,26009,2
26010,the space for your cards is way too tight.. you can barely get a normal credit card in the slots!,26010,2
26010,"and, then getting them out is even harder...",26010,2
26010,I do like the clear ID spot on the front but that is all...,26010,2
26011,Tiny.,26011,2
26011,"Unless you're a twig, this barley covered my chest, and left most of my bottom exposed.",26011,2
26011,"Also, lasted one use.",26011,2
26011,Bah.,26011,2
26011,The velco snagged the skirt and tore the fabric.,26011,2
26011,"This isn't meant for Halloween, it's more a ""Come Hither"" type of one time use.",26011,2
26011,Wasn't really worth it for one use.,26011,2
26011,Sad.,26011,2
26012,"pics here very cute, fits nothing like picture and for sure order up a few sizes then normal",26012,2
26013,"In the picture the item looks like a longer cardigan, but in reality, it is short.",26013,2
26013,Mine came with a hole in the side,26013,2
26014,Fit everywhere except my chest.,26014,2
26014,"Not tagged so unsure if it is really a
large?",26014,2
26014,?,26014,2
26015,Too big to pass.,26015,2
26015,Looks cheap.,26015,2
26016,Bought because it said with brush.,26016,2
26016,"Did not come with brush, it was missing.",26016,2
26016,Disappointing.,26016,2
26017,"not sticky enough, and does not really provide enough support",26017,2
26018,Not worth the money,26018,2
26019,Returned it because all my friends said it looks cheap due to the two-tone color of this coat.,26019,2
26019,Why would anyone design it like this???,26019,2
26019,Single black would have totally been fine.,26019,2
26019,"Material felt fine, size fit fine, just the color...",26019,2
26019,Designer should be fired.,26019,2
26020,"I ordered an extra large and I am not a huge person, I just like my clothes roomy.",26020,2
26020,This seems to have been designed for a 12 year old with no figure.,26020,2
26021,After reading review and review and looking sizes I went with the 2X thinking it would be perfect with the little stretch people were talking about.,26021,2
26021,After I bought this it was wrinkled and smelling like plastic.,26021,2
26021,The color was a dull burgundy and didn't look anything like the picture.,26021,2
26021,I'm very disappointed.,26021,2
26022,They are to small do you have a bigger size,26022,2
26023,it just fits..almost too small,26023,2
26024,"Shiny,  looks like its a basketball jersey due to fabric",26024,2
26025,To small,26025,2
26026,"Is a full 5-7 inches shorter than appears on the model (I'm 5' 6"" and it hit me mid-calf.",26026,2
26026,"Returned it, no problem with return, so 2-stars.",26026,2
26027,"Not what I expected, very small",26027,2
26028,"This one was lightweight, and looked just like the picture!",26028,2
26028,I loved it while it lasted.,26028,2
26028,I had it about three weeks when the bottom gem broke off of the bar.,26028,2
26028,"I thought maybe it was a loose screw, but the entire gem with the dangle broke.",26028,2
26028,"I wasn't rough on it, by any means.",26028,2
26028,"Cute, but disappointing purchase.",26028,2
26029,SRIT WAS TOO SMALL FIT TOO TIGHT..,26029,2
26029,THE FITTING SCALE FOR THIS ITEM IS WRONG ....PLEAS REPLY WITH A SOLUTION SO THAT I MAY HAVE THE CORRECT SIZE PLEASE..,26029,2
26030,"Three of the 4 pair, one arm broke off each.",26030,2
26031,I've ordered ear patches before but not this brand.,26031,2
26031,They don't stick even with cleaning your lobe.,26031,2
26031,They were a waste.,26031,2
26031,Think I'll stick with Lobe wonder.,26031,2
26032,I gave it three stars because it is cute and drapes very similar to how the model shows it.,26032,2
26032,"However, the yellow was so see-through that I could not wear it and am sending it back.",26032,2
26032,The black is perfect though.,26032,2
26033,"Pretty, but broken.",26033,2
26033,I have to reglue it.,26033,2
26034,Clasp broke first time I wore them,26034,2
26035,"I think their sizing is much smaller than ours,beware !",26035,2
26035,!,26035,2
26036,Very small.,26036,2
26037,not impressed with the description saying men's large.,26037,2
26037,"finally got it, almost a month after ordering it, and it's a women's large if not smaller.",26037,2
26038,"Love the shoe but they run a little to big, actually ordered 2 pair an E and M ( at separate times) I knew the E would be wide, but much wider than I thought.",26038,2
26038,So ordered M which also turned out to be to big.,26038,2
26038,"Already worn, unable to return per return slip.",26038,2
26038,Would love to exchange  for an 8 (6 European ).,26038,2
26038,Will see.,26038,2
26039,Love the design.,26039,2
26039,The product faded substantially after first wash,26039,2
26040,I love this septum but my skull is turning pink,26040,2
26041,It's not authentic and is a cheap Made in China replica.,26041,2
26041,You get what you pay for!,26041,2
26041,Still ok for the price.,26041,2
26042,"Weird fit
Scratchy material
Odd smell",26042,2
26043,These rings were a little bit better in size I ordered three sets of rings together there were two that came that were extremely small.,26043,2
26043,And these were slightly bigger I could fit maybe three of them halfway on my fingers but they really need to start making these rings and several different sizes to fit several different finger types!,26043,2
26043,Service different customers not just little teeny tiny hands.,26043,2
26044,I would have given 5 stars THE ZIPPER!!!,26044,2
26044,ruin every thing!,26044,2
26044,it went down with some strugle to go up it was worse it closed then it opens half way!,26044,2
26044,the zipper ruins the dress it truly is pretty dress,26044,2
26045,The measurements here are confusing.,26045,2
26045,"It says folded length is 12"" but then in product dimensions indicates 16""...the latter is actually correct, so having purchased it to specifically fit in a certain bag, I had to return it.",26045,2
26046,"This is NOT  cotton blend, Maybe the shirt is but the pants definitely are NOT.",26046,2
26046,The make of the items are not given in the items but the pants are most likely full polyester.,26046,2
26046,I can tell by the silkness of them.,26046,2
26046,What a disappointment.,26046,2
26046,I can live the shirts (I got two different sizes for my grandsons).,26046,2
26046,"And, they have an odor that I hope washes out.",26046,2
26046,I would have given them one star but for the shirts.,26046,2
26047,faded quickly and too heavy,26047,2
26048,Definitely not the right size.,26048,2
26048,And the shirt is very see through and thin.,26048,2
26049,Thin material no support like a shirt had to wear a bikini top underneath.,26049,2
26049,It is see through and runs smaller.. the bottoms barely covered by but!,26049,2
26049,I don't have much of one.,26049,2
26049,As a mom I needed more coverage..it was not what I expected but the top works as a swim suit top if you wear a more supportive top underneath.,26049,2
26050,Good but I'm not happy with  Quality and  with the finishing of golden edge,26050,2
26051,I have only worn one of them for a day and already all the plastic colored coating on it has come off in my mouth.,26051,2
26051,Really disappointed and upset by this.,26051,2
26052,"A couple of my gauges are disformed and have flaws surfaces, so I wouldn't recommend this item because of poor quality.",26052,2
26053,It was labeled XXL but when he tried it on it was actually too small and he is very thin & skinny!,26053,2
26053,He felt the material was too itchy and there was a plastic feel to some areas.,26053,2
26053,He was disappointed.,26053,2
26053,We easily returned it and will order something else for him for his birthday.,26053,2
26054,Not true to size,26054,2
26055,European cut thus slightly small for my frame.,26055,2
26056,They do not work well with glasses at all.,26056,2
26057,Cute when pony tail actually stays on it!,26057,2
26057,"But unfortunately, pony tail comes off with minimal activity.",26057,2
26058,i get a lot of compliments but it unravels at the ends,26058,2
26059,I'm a pants size 12/14 and bought the 3XL size.,26059,2
26059,Can't even get them on.,26059,2
26059,Way too small.,26059,2
26060,Very small.,26060,2
26060,Size up atleast 2 sizes if not more.,26060,2
26060,Cute design and made well.,26060,2
26060,To bad it was tooooo small.,26060,2
26061,"not as I expected it to be, but my granddaughter liked it...picture is small and unclear",26061,2
26062,This shirt is not my favorite.,26062,2
26062,"Looks super adorable on the model, but the shirt is not the same one I got in the mail.",26062,2
26062,The model looks like she's wearing an cute oversized sweater/shirt with cute lace on top... Definitely similar to what I got except for the fact that it looks like a small t-shirt that got the top part cut off and lace sewn on to the top.,26062,2
26062,The lace part kept rolling up as the day went on.,26062,2
26062,"Also, if you have anything bigger then a C, don't get this top.",26062,2
26062,It won't fit that part.,26062,2
26063,Very bad quality.,26063,2
26063,The sewing is terrible and it's bigger than described.,26063,2
26063,Not to mention that it took forever to arrive.,26063,2
26064,really cheap;y made,26064,2
26065,Looks like picture and came on time.,26065,2
26065,"However,  WAY small.",26065,2
26065,Also see through.,26065,2
26065,Giving away for free.,26065,2
26066,Bad material,26066,2
26067,"Very nice shoes, but ran smaller.",26067,2
26068,The case is very difficult to flex.,26068,2
26068,"I probably should have thought of this, but since the opening is so small, you have to use quite a bit of force to open the case.",26068,2
26068,"I don't have arthritis or any other physical difficulties, either.",26068,2
26068,I'm disappointed as I bought this for my young daughter but she's unable to open it by herself.,26068,2
26069,Not as great as I thought it would be,26069,2
26070,A bit on the small side.,26070,2
26071,It holds you where you need it most.,26071,2
26071,The only thing I didn't like was the thigh part was a little bit too tight,26071,2
26072,Ran to small for me.,26072,2
26072,"Not worth the time to return, so will just donate it .",26072,2
26073,WAS DISAPPOINTED THE SIZE WAS ON THE SMALL SIZE...MY GRANDSON ONLY GOT TO WEAR THE OUTFIT FOR A COUPLE DAYS.,26073,2
26074,Very small.,26074,2
26074,Normally 3x fits good..,26074,2
26074,This is 4 inches small.,26074,2
26075,Not good for kids with wide foot or big big-toe,26075,2
26076,I wear a 6  and small way too small and material was not good quality.,26076,2
26077,Too lage returning,26077,2
26078,Ordered an XL.,26078,2
26078,Couldn't even get my arms in it.,26078,2
26078,Wanted to wear it so badly.,26078,2
26078,so pretty but very very small.,26078,2
26078,i'm usually a size 12,26078,2
26079,every sock is a different size.,26079,2
26079,One is so small it looks like it is for a toddler.,26079,2
26079,Would not recommend.,26079,2
26080,"Looks good, but the material is sub par.",26080,2
26080,Heavy pilling after one wear.,26080,2
26080,Stretches out of shape and does not return.,26080,2
26080,I've worn it twice and I'm sure it's going to desolve in the wash.  You get what you pay for.,26080,2
26080,Id skip this one.,26080,2
26080,Would not buy again.,26080,2
26081,"The picture looks like it falls off the shoulder, but the neck line is not large enough to do that.",26081,2
26081,"That was the look I was expecting, but unfortunately did not meet my expectations.",26081,2
26081,"I am a size 6, and this could not be achieved that with a larger size.",26081,2
26081,"A little misleading in
some photos, but not all.",26081,2
26082,"Top is way too small, does not look like the tops in the pics.",26082,2
26082,Skirt is fine.,26082,2
26083,These sandals are a waste of money.,26083,2
26083,They look nice but they are very uncomfortable.,26083,2
26083,I wore them once and never used them again.,26083,2
26083,Just look for something better.,26083,2
26084,Too small .,26084,2
26084,Item does not look like the picture.,26084,2
26085,I'm not a big fan of the materiel and they are slightly see through.,26085,2

26085,I put these yoga tights to the test and they failed sadly :( do not stay on while exercising.,26085,2
26085,"Overall the price is not bad, they look cute maybe to wear around the house.",26085,2
26086,My biggest problem with this dress is not the style or fit.,26086,2
26086,The material is very rough and feels cheap.,26086,2
26086,Cute otherwise so it's a shame.,26086,2
26086,"I do love this designer, though.",26086,2
26086,"I also was not pleased with the packaging which was ripped, the dress was wadded up and wrinkled and because the material is thick and rough it required quite a it of work to get it to fall into it's natural lines.",26086,2
26087,was advertised as adult t shirt but was actually youth size,26087,2
26088,Fit is small.,26088,2
26088,I sized up and got the fit I would've expected from smaller size (is 2Xl fits like xl).,26088,2

26088,(Only put my hands in it once).,26088,2
26089,Runs small.,26089,2
26090,I liked the reversible design of the hat but didn't care much for the velcro that attached it.,26090,2
26090,For some reason it was really big and it would block my vision.,26090,2
26090,I'm a landscaper and it just wasn't what I was looking for.,26090,2
26090,"I think if someone wanted it for fishing, hiking, beach etc it would work good but not for me.",26090,2
26091,Nothing is wrong with this item.,26091,2
26091,It's just smaller and not as soft.,26091,2
26091,I would rather spend more on a better one so it can be used more often.,26091,2
26092,It's a little tight and I had ordered the next size up.,26092,2

26096,"This sweater is wonderful quality for the price and a pretty print, but I have no idea what the other reviewers were referring too about it being sized large.",26096,2
26096,I bought a 2X in hopes that it would hang like a sweater dress...it's SOOOOOOO tight and short!!,26096,2

26097,"I got an XL, I'm athletic about  5'9"" and 175lb.",26097,2
26097,I like the color and that they aren't fold over but the for was all wrong.,26097,2
26097,They were right across my hips and had such a large crotch I had to wear them over my belly button to fit right which then made them way to short,26097,2
26098,Wore just once.,26098,2
26098,"Like it when it's on the hanger but once on, it's fairly clinging.",26098,2

26101,"Well, you get what you pay for.",26101,2
26101,I'm pretty sure this isn't even sew but maybe hand stitched on the shoulders.,26101,2
26101,Very cheaply made.,26101,2
26101,There's also no hemming anywhere on tank.,26101,2
26101,It's just cut material,26101,2
26102,Buy a size up runs small,26102,2
26103,Cheap looking and kind of see through.,26103,2

26106,"However, the elastic was very weak and broke on me a couple of weeks.",26106,2
26106,"All I did was make a quick move with the arm the bracelet was on, and stones went flying.",26106,2
26106,"Maybe if you're not an active person, this unit is for you.",26106,2
26106,"If not, get one with better construction.",26106,2
26107,"When I opened the shipping bag, my whole apartment smelled bad.",26107,2
26107,This product gave off a strong chemical smell that reeked for more than a week.,26107,2
26107,"I placed it in a sandwich bag filled with baking soda and rice to get rid of the smell, but the smell still seeped through the bag.",26107,2
26107,"Finally after almost two weeks, the smell is almost gone.",26107,2
26107,I will know if it's useful in a few days when I use it.,26107,2
26108,from the reviews i read that this was a great purchase the truth is that It is NOT it is very LOW quality and the hooks in the back are defective and now i can't even return it.,26108,2
26108,It was a waste of money you're better off going to forever 21 and getting something better :) save your money and don't buy it it doesn't even look like the picture at all.,26108,2
26109,I love the way the dress looks as far as design but I am disappointed in a couple of things.,26109,2
26109,First of all the sleeves are long and I was expecting 3/4 inch.,26109,2
26109,"Second, it's like a spandex material and shows EVERYTHING so definitely wear a slip.",26109,2
26109,And also the one in the picture looks lower cut the one I received does Not have any type of neckline.,26109,2
26109,Not really impressed and won't be buying anything else from this company.,26109,2
26110,Nice for the price but.. Come really small,26110,2
26111,Arrived,26111,2
26112,Shirt was x large.,26112,2
26112,Fits small like a chinese person.,26112,2
26112,Since it came from china.,26112,2
26112,Was disappointed,26112,2
26113,Loved the look but was just too small.,26113,2
26114,Dress is cute and decent quality for price.,26114,2
26114,"However, with that being said.",26114,2
26114,It is way too short for me.,26114,2
26114,I'm only 5'1.,26114,2
26114,"If you don't mind the length, then buy it, but definitely size up!",26114,2
26115,All I wanted was black.,26115,2
26115,Why is that so hard to find??,26115,2
26115,?,26115,2
26116,Package came directly In an envelope from China.,26116,2
26116,Pre  washed  by hand 3x as black dye kept rinsing out.,26116,2
26116,I never buy  children's clothes from China..details should have been more specific.,26116,2
26117,Not a good fit.,26117,2
26117,"I have an actual 32"" waist (but often wear 29"" or 30"" waisted pants), and ordered a small hoping for something a little snug.",26117,2
26117,Not at all snug.,26117,2
26117,Unflattering.,26117,2
26118,the frame is very flimsey and it feels like it can break easily.,26118,2
26119,This top is not made for women with big breast.,26119,2
26119,Its made nice but xl is rather tight.,26119,2
26119,Wish they had a size bigger.,26119,2
26120,They are beautiful and nice quality.,26120,2
26120,I only wore them once about 3 months ago.,26120,2
26120,It left a sore on my heel and it was very hard to walk for the rest of the day.,26120,2
26120,Maybe I will try to wear them again.,26120,2
26121,This is a beautiful case but it is very hard to.press down on the side buttons to control power buttons and volume control.,26121,2
26121,Also the phone charger port cover is not good.,26121,2
26121,"Once used the port stays open and does not close; it hasn't broken off yet, but it will soon due to poor quality.",26121,2
26122,Sizing is not traditional and runs very small.,26122,2
26122,"I did like the style, but the quality seems poor.",26122,2
26122,I would not recommend this purchase.,26122,2
26123,"The bow on the back is saggy and droopy, not sewn up like in the photo.",26123,2
26123,Also it is extremely small.,26123,2
26123,I wear a medium and I ordered an XL.,26123,2
26123,It barely fits my 10 year old daughter.,26123,2
26124,"pants fit, xl top is more like a small/medium.",26124,2
26124,shoulder seams don't even go all across the shoulder.,26124,2
26124,"Fabric and comfort is great, but poorly made.",26124,2
26124,"As a seamstress,  it appears they used two different size patterns for the top and bottoms, fabric is stretchy, but the fit is so poor i'm not sure I'll ever be able to wear these.",26124,2
26124,"I bought them for a vacation, where I was hoping they could be worn out of the bedroom as lounging pajama's.",26124,2
26124,Wouldn't even wear these around family.,26124,2
26125,"Ever pair I've bought came scrathed on the side , I love them but what's up with Thay",26125,2
26126,It is made for someone very small.,26126,2
26126,Should be marked as petite.,26126,2
26126,Arms are too short and waist sits at my ribs.,26126,2
26127,Printing was off center,26127,2
26128,"Too sheer, and if you have large breasts it makes you look pregnant...",26128,2
26129,These glasses are nice but a little bent from non padded packaging.,26129,2
26129,"They're clearly black and silver in the picture but i received them yesterday(on time), but they were black and gold.",26129,2
26129,I don't really wear gold so not sure what happened..a little disappointed.,26129,2
26130,"The beads were not red as the picture, pale more like reddish pink, did not appreciate the distorted color",26130,2
26131,Cheap quality .. one time use,26131,2
26132,Be sure to check the product dimensions.,26132,2
26132,Ordered this as a gift and returned it--it is TINY.,26132,2
26133,This bra is so small the sizing doesn't make sense.,26133,2
26133,I ordered on size up and it was still to small.,26133,2
26133,Just an example of how small I'm a 36 C and the bra was about a 34 a/b cup,26133,2
26134,"I purchased for myself as a ""test"" for a birthday gift for someone else.",26134,2
26134,No birthday present purchase.,26134,2
26134,I ordered a large (in case there was shrinkage) - - - I wear a medium and it is tight in the arms.,26134,2
26134,Not quality fabric for this price.,26134,2
26134,Would not recommend.,26134,2
26135,A lot smaller than expected.,26135,2
26136,The pillow is much smaller than what I expected,26136,2
26137,Not what I expected.,26137,2
26137,Looks worn,26137,2
26138,Horrible.,26138,2
26138,"It is nothing like the picture and has weird sheer parts, not for the workplace.",26138,2
26138,It was cheap and I think if I kept it on for another minute it would unravel.,26138,2
26138,Waaaaay too small a would recommend a size 0 to go to the largest size and everyone else don't get it.,26138,2
26138,The size 0 people also should not get it because it is too cheap in quality.,26138,2
26139,Color like it..design owseme..size to small.. XL would be great.....,26139,2
26140,"A little thin material, somewhat tight.",26140,2
26141,"Poor quality, very tight.",26141,2
26141,Returning.,26141,2
26142,"Poor construction, poor fit.",26142,2
26143,This product fit as expected.,26143,2
26143,I had to reset both for better placement and after that the adhesive wasn't the same.,26143,2
26143,It kept coming up in certain areas- I wore it for about 3 hours and they came off extremely easily..,26143,2
26144,"I don't think I have ever written a bad review, but I feel like I should write this in order to keep others from buying this product.",26144,2
26144,"The shirt looks cute in the picture, but the actual shirt looks a lot different.",26144,2
26144,It hangs.,26144,2
26144,.,26144,2
26144,.weird on your body.,26144,2
26144,Like the bottom of the shirt is uneven.,26144,2
26144,"The material makes it feel like you are wearing a thing, see-through sack.",26144,2
26144,It just does not fit like a woman's shirt should.,26144,2
26144,"If they fixed these issues and made the shirt look more like the shirt in the picture, it would be worth more than two stars.",26144,2
26145,Lens came out on a windy day on the river.,26145,2
26145,Gone,26145,2
26146,Main part of dress high quality stretchy fabric.,26146,2
26146,Quite large for the size chart listed...,26146,2
26146,I looked like a pumpkin in it...,26146,2
26146,I wear an 8 but ordered a med....,26146,2
26146,Mistake!!,26146,2
26146,And I consider myself capable of ironing anything to make sharp and gorgeous...so I order even though some reviews referred to the top part beung very wrinkled...MISTAKE AGAIN...,26146,2
26146,I could not make this look good.....,26146,2
26146,Even if I was willing to go as a fat pumpkin chick....I wasn't willing to go out looking like a half smashed pumkin....lol....RETURNING,26146,2
26147,"didnt like, arrive on time, didn't like the fit.",26147,2
26147,The interior is not attached to the exterior fabric so its unconformable.,26147,2
26147,"The hoody is too small, won't stay put.",26147,2
26148,The dress looks NOTHING like the picture.,26148,2
26148,"I ordered the blue one with the ""silver"" top.",26148,2
26148,The silver was only glued on sequins and the blue showed through a LOT.,26148,2
26148,"The picture makes it look like the top is completely silver, or white underneath.",26148,2
26148,"The hips were a bit too large on me, but I did have to order 2 sizes up in order to accommodate my breasticles.",26148,2
26148,Package arrived quickly.,26148,2
26149,"It is a pretty ring, but not long after I had it, a stone fell out.",26149,2
26149,I have had it a while now & a few stones have fallen out.,26149,2
26149,I bought an aquamarine one from a diff company & not 1 stone is missing.,26149,2
26150,Very cute but very tight.,26150,2
26150,Not a lot of give.,26150,2
26150,I'm not a big girl and can't wear these,26150,2
26151,not what i expected,26151,2
26152,This shirt looks NOTHING like the one on the model.,26152,2
26152,Its made of a material that feels like it should be used for weather proofing.,26152,2
26152,"Additionally, the color of the actual shirt is VERY different.",26152,2
26153,The product has a very weird lining that rides up.,26153,2
26153,Love the design.,26153,2
26153,The lining ruined it.,26153,2
26154,This product is too small.,26154,2
26154,It is a size that fits a child or an anorexic!,26154,2
26154,The did not specify sizes!,26154,2
26154,You have to orders much larger size than offered!,26154,2
26154,Otherwise you are stuck with a difficult process of return?!!,26154,2
26154,!,26154,2
26155,"This dress, it looks nice for the first day you wear it.",26155,2
26155,but after that don't expect to wear it again.,26155,2
26155,"I washed it and all the color came out and it looks like a faded mess, not only that, but it wrinkles and stays wrinkly.",26155,2
26155,"I have ironed and I have hung to dry, I have also tried delicate dry cycle.",26155,2
26155,Nothing will take the wrinkles out.,26155,2
26155,the material is stretchy which is nice but it lost its color and it wrinkles so it just looks terrible.,26155,2
26155,"also after the first wash, the hem started to roll up and just stay rolled, no amount of ironing or hang drying or gentle tumbling would get this dress to even out.",26155,2
26155,I ended up giving it to good will because the hassle of a return is so ridiculous.,26155,2
26155,"The is the chance I take when I shop online, but I hope this review will help others to see the benefit of not purchasing this item and moving to something that is going to give them a little more bang for their buck.",26155,2
26155,"This dress, it not worth a buck.",26155,2
26156,"I went by the weight in the size chart when I purchased these, but they were so small my daughter could barely sqeeze into them.",26156,2
26156,We gave them to her best friend's little sister.,26156,2
26157,The size is nowhere near what a typical 3x should be.,26157,2
26157,I actually ordered larger because I was afraid it might be smaller.,26157,2
26157,"On the upside, it's very pretty just like the picture.",26157,2
26158,"Cute, but extremely sheer and you can see right through it.",26158,2
26158,Looks nicer online than in person.,26158,2
26159,This says dark red but its not.,26159,2
26159,I have dark red shoes and was hoping it would match.,26159,2
26159,Its bright crayola crayon red.,26159,2
26159,I am keeping it and getting more shoes to match but it is not what is described.,26159,2
26160,Cheap,26160,2
26161,"Waist fit fine, I guess I'm more of a boxer guy, these hugged me too tight down under.",26161,2
26162,They're huge!!!!,26162,2
26162,It thought mittens were for newborns- so they don't scratch themselves.,26162,2
26162,But these are way too big for a 8 pound newborn.,26162,2
26163,"I'm not pleased the bone in the back kept pushing out, I can't wear it with a fitted dress because you would see it ,i took a medium that's what I normally wears , everywhere else fits good so I don't think it's a size issue, so I'm disappointed because the reviews are good",26163,2
26164,My girlfriend loved it but the zipper broke on the change compartment the first time she used it.,26164,2
26164,"Since I bought it for an overseas trip ahead of time instead of my usual last minute, it's too late too send it back.",26164,2
26165,Don't like them.,26165,2
26165,"I only wore the lowest level and did like the increased height, but as someone else noted, they have a cushioning system that (for me anyway) is just way to soft.",26165,2
26165,Its only in the heel portion and the left insert is much softer than the right.,26165,2
26165,Each step is like coming down on a wet sponge with my heel causing me to walk funny and to feel the stress in my back.,26165,2
26165,"For me, a solid insert would be much better.",26165,2
26165,Also note that they were way too narrow in my case and would move around a bit in the shoe (men's 11.5).,26165,2
26166,Comfy but tight,26166,2
26167,Nice patterns.,26167,2
26167,Was really looking forward to wearing but not even close to fitting me.,26167,2
26167,I wear a USA 11.,26167,2
26167,At least my kids love them and will get good out of them at that price.,26167,2
26168,I did not like it at all it was way too small and does not look like the one in the picture!!!,26168,2
26168,!,26168,2
26169,"These shoes look awesome, but my husband, who normally wears a size 12, couldn't even get his foot in the shoe.",26169,2
26170,didnt like it and the material it poor.,26170,2
26171,I didn't like the material.,26171,2
26172,Nothing in the envelope,26172,2
26173,"I ordered a XL - bust is a 40C , height 5'5, 170 pretty sure it is a large size not XL
It was so short !",26173,2
26173,Definetly more of a tunic than a dress - could not wear without leggings - so I will not be wearing -hard to tell the size as it has no tags when it arrives ...... if it was longer or the right size it would be perfect !,26173,2
26173,:(,26173,2
26174,Band keeps coming loose and falling off music cleft.,26174,2
26174,Could be a cute accessory but rather annoying!,26174,2
26175,Smaller than expected.,26175,2
26176,One of the 3 immediately fell apart.,26176,2
26176,It was never even worn before it was in pieces.,26176,2
26176,I am disappointed.,26176,2
26177,Bigger than I anticipated so they look crazy in my nose.,26177,2
26178,This was not the size that I wanted ( it was too small),26178,2
26179,The good thing is the cost was delivered way before the estimated delivery date however I was very disappointed in the coat I got.,26179,2
26179,The material is cheap and the hood is not big enough to cover the forehead plus I ordered a small and got a medium which was still big in the chest for me but the arms were short.,26179,2
26179,I am very petite at 5feet exactly and weigh 97lbs and the medium I got was as mentioned big but with short arms.,26179,2
26179,Also the buttons were seen on wrong as in not lined well with the button holes plus one of the inseems I later found was not seen correctly basically it was like something made with cheap material for a Halloween costume.,26179,2
26179,Don't waste your money in this cheap coat.,26179,2
26179,Although I must add that the company were helpful and issued me a speedy half of what I is if plus full shipping costs asking me to keep it but one if my sisters who is a seamstress asked to keep it so she could alter and fix it for herself.,26179,2
26180,Too small,26180,2
26181,Not flattering for anyone with a tummy.,26181,2
26181,"Plus, the sizing was a bit small and the color wasn't the best for me (redhead).",26181,2
26181,"Perhaps in another color, this would be better... just be aware that it will show all your tummy flaws.",26181,2
26182,this is supposed to be 2X?,26182,2
26182,normally 2X is roomy on me.,26182,2
26182,what happen they run out of fabric?,26182,2
26183,Low compression,26183,2
26184,Sent it back.,26184,2
26184,Runs really small and poor quality.,26184,2
26185,"Coat was very cute, but it was way too small.",26185,2
26185,I usually wear a L so I ordered an XL and it was way too tight.,26185,2
26185,Too bad it doesn't come an bigger.,26185,2
26186,The model must be teeny because it was a total crop top for me.,26186,2
26187,Cheap looking.,26187,2
26187,"You get what you pay for, I guess.",26187,2
26187,Not delicate as it appears in the picture.,26187,2
26188,They fit but wasn't what I thought I was going to receive.,26188,2
26188,It's supposed to be a compression type material and it is nothing more than just a regular tank top.,26188,2
26188,I am not impressed and won't be purchasing anything else from this place.,26188,2
26189,They did not have the hardware on the straps assembled.,26189,2
26189,I had to thread the hardware on the straps myself.,26189,2
26189,Also it runs very small.,26189,2
26190,Nice toy for not for $16!!!,26190,2
26190,My fault not to read the size specifications before I bought it.,26190,2
26190,It's tiny.,26190,2
26191,The wallet I received was a thick plastic.,26191,2
26191,"The wallet had a pattern, but had no suede.",26191,2
26191,I returned it.,26191,2
26192,cheap quality and not worth the high price.,26192,2
26192,"very small, child like.",26192,2
26193,"I wear a size 6 & rather busty, so I ordered a large, and it was way too small in all directions - length, bust, couldn't even get it all the way on.",26193,2
26193,I ended up giving it to a friend's 12-year old daughter.,26193,2
26193,"It's a cute style, and it looks good on her.",26193,2
26194,cool socks!,26194,2
26194,But the sizing was way off and fits way to small.,26194,2
26195,Very thin.,26195,2
26195,Poor quality.,26195,2
26195,Much smaller than the actual size.,26195,2
26196,the cup sizes were very small for my breast and the material is very irritating,26196,2
26197,low quality.,26197,2
26197,I wished I returned at the moment of the purchase.,26197,2
26198,Poor quality!,26198,2
26199,poor quality fabric,26199,2
26200,Very tacky,26200,2
26201,"While the bracelet is cute and looks like the picture, unfortunately the chains are cheap and fall apart pretty quickly.",26201,2
26201,Plus the chain linking the ring to the bracelet is too long for the average hand.,26201,2
26202,"Nice ring set, but turned.",26202,2
26203,"Terrible, awful material it's itchy and real stuff, yuck x100",26203,2
26204,This is not a high-quality item.,26204,2
26204,"When I received it, there were a few strings hanging that I needed to snip off.",26204,2
26204,The left pocket also had a 3-inch hole that I had to sew shut.,26204,2
26204,"Despite being featured in one of Amazon's lists (beautiful things, December 2015), the product was on back order directly from China, and I had to pay for expedited shipping or I was going to have to wait upwards of a month to receive it.",26204,2
26204,"That said, now that it's here, and now that I've taken care of the strings and holes, its a pretty good-looking and warm coat.",26204,2
26204,I don't expect it will last more than two or three seasons though.,26204,2
26205,The material is kinda nice.,26205,2
26205,It doesn't look exactly like the picture but pretty close.,26205,2
26205,I thought it was super cute.,26205,2
26205,I was excited to try it on.,26205,2
26205,The bottoms were really big and loose.,26205,2
26205,The top has a tiny bit of push up but not enough.,26205,2
26205,The top like fit weird and was kind of big as well but not as big as the bottoms.,26205,2
26205,I don't have very big boobs or a very big butt so that's probably why.,26205,2
26205,Overall the fit is big.,26205,2
26205,I ordered a size small.,26205,2
26205,"I'm around the 5-5""5 foot range and 100-110 pound range.",26205,2
26205,I'm disappointed.,26205,2
26205,I really liked it too.,26205,2
26205,I most likely will be returning this.,26205,2
26206,"I got the style two which was beautiful fabric, loved it!",26206,2
26206,I was so excited that I found a style where everything tied so it was more adjustable.,26206,2
26206,"The top fit perfectly......now for the but.......unfortunately for me and for the low rating, the coverage for the gluteus was showing too maxims, in other words didn't cover enough for my for my taste.",26206,2
26207,Would be cute if it didn't run small.,26207,2
26207,Get a size bigger,26207,2
26208,18K gold my ass!,26208,2
26208,This was cheap and broke in like a month.,26208,2
26208,It was stiff and plastic.,26208,2
26209,I bought the Hoenn badges as a new product but it was obviously used - two badge have that rusty-faded paint look as seen from my picture.,26209,2
26209,The rest of the badges were in better condition.,26209,2
26210,Very hard to get on over shoulders,26210,2
26211,a bit to loose fiting even for a Hawaiian shirt.,26211,2
26211,Two buttons are missing.,26211,2
26212,The stirrups work best for me because I wear short socks at work.,26212,2
26212,The gator clip attachments work much better than the other types because they don't come off easily and are more secure.,26212,2
26212,The downside is the stitching where the loops connect.,26212,2
26212,I've had the product for about 2 months and the stitching is coming loose on both sides.,26212,2
26212,I wear the stays 40 hrs a week with ankle high boots.,26212,2
26213,"It's a nice jacket, but it is not real leather.",26213,2
26213,It is comfortable and warm... the jacket itself is nice.,26213,2
26213,It is misleading that it was advertised as leather when it is not.,26213,2
26214,really need to send back.,26214,2
26214,broke on opening.,26214,2
26214,it c was for a Christmas gift.,26214,2
26215,the sleeves on this dress are cut weird and the neck tie was awkward.,26215,2
26215,"Besides that the dress doesn't flow like pictured, I even ordered a XXL after reading the reviews and it didn't fit right.",26215,2
26215,"I'm 5'8"" and 200lbs so I know I'm a big girl but this fit horribly.",26215,2
26215,Seams were not stitched cleanly and there was loose threads everywhere.,26215,2
26215,Would definitely not recommend this dress at all.,26215,2
26216,"It was cheaply made and irritated my neck, the charm fell off a week after buying it",26216,2
26217,"fair to poor quality , small fit , many large tags inside shirt - size xl = others m",26217,2
26218,Awkward fit through hip and behind area.,26218,2
26218,Arms very small and fabric very stiff and non-forgiving.,26218,2
26219,When I first got these I was quite pleased.,26219,2
26219,My son loved the colors and they fit him well.,26219,2
26219,"They fit as expected, and the only thing I didn't care for was the shape of the shoe, it was hard for him (5 year old) to tell which went on which foot because both sides curved in.",26219,2
26219,The strap broke off after just  2 1/2 months.,26219,2
26219,I would not purchase again,26219,2
26220,I really wanted to like these because the elastic waist is covered.,26220,2
26220,My son gets a rash from the elastic that isn't covered with cotton so I ordered these.,26220,2
26220,They were small compared to the standard size he wears and they were smaller after washing and drying.,26220,2
26220,"Also, they are bulky and lumpy, sort of think like old fashioned underwear.",26220,2
26220,It bunches up and twists when my son pulls the underwear up and down.,26220,2
26220,We don't like it at all and would not order it again.,26220,2
26220,"Why can't someone make a smooth, light weight cotton brief with a covered waistband?",26220,2
26221,First.. Everyone said order big..,26221,2
26221,I did and it looks sloppy.,26221,2
26221,I'm particular and this looks like a cheap Walmart top.,26221,2
26221,Sleeves are long and sag off the shoulders.,26221,2
26221,Nice color.,26221,2
26221,Lace is ok. Should t have ordered as big as everyone said to,26221,2
26222,"Was a bit dismayed by this product, having been a wearer of 2(x)ist for several years.",26222,2
26222,"Turns out that the ""Essential"" briefs are 100% cotton.",26222,2
26222,"No big deal for some, but for those folks seeking a bit more support for the equipment, there is effectively no support.",26222,2
26222,"Seek out the 2(x)ist ""Stretch Core"" boxer briefs instead, as they are constructed with some spandex that provides the support some of us seek.",26222,2
26223,it broke the first day when i wore it.,26223,2
26224,Too small,26224,2
26225,I ordered an XL based on reviews and the chart.,26225,2
26225,I wanted to allow for any variations.,26225,2
26225,I bought it gir a special anniversary.,26225,2
26225,Dinner and a concert.,26225,2
26225,It fit beautifully and did amazing things for my cleavage!,26225,2
26225,"However, at the end of the evening every seam has these elastic strings sticking out.",26225,2
26225,I am glad it was a dark theater!,26225,2
26225,It was worn 1 time.,26225,2
26225,I didn't even launder it prior to wearing.,26225,2
26225,"Unfortunately, this is a bust for me.",26225,2
26225,Don't waste your money.,26225,2
26226,Nothing like the photo.,26226,2
26226,Doesn't flow.,26226,2
26226,It's too short and the color just looks dirty in person.,26226,2
26227,Runs very small.,26227,2
26227,I ordered a large and it was way too small on the top,26227,2
26228,I got the silver and it looks cheap.,26228,2
26228,I won't wear it much.,26228,2
26228,You get what you pay for.,26228,2
26229,"Although I usually wear a med, it was a slim shirt and tight across the chest.",26229,2
26229,"Next time, I will order a US large.",26229,2
26230,"When it was first received, it smelled bad, it doesn't anymore after airing out for a while.",26230,2
26230,Tassels fall off easily though.,26230,2
26230,"I just left it in the car, wasn't even wearing it and every time I did that, I find a tassel on the seat when I picked it up again.",26230,2
26231,Cute design but not functional in the water.,26231,2
26231,Top part doesn't have any thing to  come around on side of breast to connect the suit to body and bottom is very baggy and not doable on water.,26231,2
26231,Hard to tie or untie once it's wet.,26231,2
26231,Diving into water might drop your bottoms.,26231,2
26232,"WAY, WAY TOO SMALL!",26232,2
26232,"I ordered an X-large, which is my normal size.",26232,2
26232,It was so tight that i was afraid to move.,26232,2
26232,It was super cute and the color is very bright.,26232,2
26232,The material feels nice too.,26232,2
26232,But a size XL might fit a Medium comfortably.,26232,2
26232,It will be worth the money if you can get a good fit.,26232,2
26232,So sad that I won't be able to wear it :-(,26232,2
26233,Quality is not the best but they were kind enough to offer 20% refund instead of return that will cost me more than the item.,26233,2
26234,this jacket is entirely too small.....need a larger per size for American The American Woman,26234,2
26235,Just too small.,26235,2
26236,The XS is still a bit larger than I expected and I may end up just giving it away.,26236,2
26237,Very disappointed with this dress.,26237,2
26237,I was really hoping this dress would be as beautiful as the pictures.,26237,2
26237,Color was lovely.,26237,2
26237,Cut was nice; I especially liked the style of the nursing top.,26237,2
26237,"However, the fabric was so cheap and horrible.",26237,2
26237,"It was thin, stratchy, and not stretchy.",26237,2
26237,Sent this one back.,26237,2
26238,"bottom fit perfect, top was too small.",26238,2
26239,Way too small.,26239,2
26239,"I am 5'6"".This product is not made for those over 5'4"".",26239,2
26239,"I had to readjust them 8 times in a three hour period, and they were still slipping.",26239,2
26239,"Very, very, very short.",26239,2
26239,"The fleece lining is good, though.",26239,2
26239,"If you're under 5'4"", just buy a size larger.",26239,2
26239,"If you're taller than that, I'd recommend buying something else.",26239,2
26240,"It was advertised for as a ski hat, it's very thin cotton, wouldn't keep me warm.",26240,2
26240,"Ok if your just wearing it too look cool, or don't need much warmth.",26240,2
26241,"They fit fine, but the seam splits a little too easily.",26241,2
26242,cheap,26242,2
26243,After about six months the zipper broke on ours.,26243,2
26243,"That may have been a fluke, but I still prefer the Halo Sleep Sacks over this.",26243,2
26244,I found this dress to have an adorable cut but it just didn't work out for me.,26244,2
26244,It was a little see through and I definitely had issues with buttoning it over my bust.,26244,2
26244,"If you're a a person with some larger boobage, you're gonna have some problems.",26244,2
26244,Order a size up!,26244,2
26244,Everywhere else the fit was quite loose.,26244,2
26244,Unfortunately I returned this dress because I didn't like the fact that it wouldn't fit my bust and it was so sheer.,26244,2
26244,The chiffon felt weird and cheap to the touch as well.,26244,2
26245,Too big.,26245,2
26245,And very see through.,26245,2
26245,Paper thin.,26245,2
26245,But very cute.,26245,2
26246,Love the style but the quality was not that great.,26246,2
26246,"The arms were uneven causing the glasses to fit slightly crooked and it did not come with
the advertised case.",26246,2
26246,Returned.,26246,2
26247,Overall the dress is cute but it would not begin to go around my bust.,26247,2
26247,I got the medium and it fit everywhere else.,26247,2
26247,"I am a ""D"" cup.",26247,2
26247,sadly I had to return it.,26247,2
26248,This bag is small.,26248,2
26248,Would fit a kindergarten or maybe first grader.,26248,2
26248,I don't think it would hold up to bigger kids and their tons of books and binders,26248,2
26249,XXL for waist 34,26249,2
26250,A little large & long,26250,2
26251,This didn't fit me well at all,26251,2
26252,Very thin.,26252,2
26253,"Pretty design, but ridiculously small.",26253,2
26253,NOT true to size at all.,26253,2
26254,I'm super bummed!!,26254,2
26254,These sunglasses are actually super cute but the lenses are cheap.,26254,2
26254,Literally the moment I pulled the glasses out of the box one of the lenses was already popped out.,26254,2
26254,I out it back in but it seems as if it was just cut too small because it literally just wiggles in the frame.,26254,2
26254,Buuummmed!,26254,2
26255,Not broken in yet.,26255,2
26255,I will keep wearing them,26255,2
26256,As far as I can tell it's a fake.,26256,2
26256,"It does not have the classic branded buttons, missing the second label, the only label on the shirt  is not the same and it looks fake.",26256,2
26256,"The cloth is thinner, not as many threads per inch, so it is somewhat see through.",26256,2
26256,"It does not seem as well made as a port authority,
If it's not a fake then Port Authority really dropped quality.",26256,2
26257,A child might like it like a teenager,26257,2
26258,"So first of all, it came to me smelling like vinegar....this alone bothered me.",26258,2
26258,"While the fabric was flowy and fairly comfortable, the actual fit was NOT what I expected.",26258,2
26258,"It was MUCH shorter in front than the back, exposing my stomach and being a B-cup, it's not because of that.",26258,2
26258,"Perhaps it's also because i'm 5'10, but this is not a shirt fit for work which is why I bought it.",26258,2
26258,Returned this item.,26258,2
26259,Fine if it's only for looks..definitely won't hold up if pulled on.,26259,2
26260,"Cute, but didn't quite fit my head",26260,2
26261,"While the size is correct, the top is simply too tight, flattening chest.",26261,2
26262,"Small in the shoulders, didn't look good on.",26262,2
26262,"I am 5'8"" and 125 lbs.",26262,2
26263,I have no idea why they just didn't use authentic normal beads!,26263,2
26263,The paint started to come off of the 3 red colored beads and flaked terribly.,26263,2
26263,Haven't owned long very upsetting.,26263,2
26264,The material is not as good as expected.,26264,2
26265,TERRIBLE FIT,26265,2
26266,Material wasn't well made,26266,2
26267,"Definitely the most comfortable underwear I've tried since my cesarean, but I'm a bit disappointed as I thought they would be much more supporting.",26267,2
26267,"At 5""5 I weighed 130 had a very small waist before pregnancy so I ordered a small even though I gained 45 pounds (mostly around my middle).",26267,2
26267,I was worried it would be too tight but unfortunately it's much too loose around my tummy and doesn't feel like it hold my organs in place the way I need it to to move comfortably without pain.,26267,2
26267,I use this item with a Velcro girdle but i still wish I could find something that would hug that area a but tighter for better support.,26267,2
26268,Ordered the blue coin purse that looked like cornflower blue.,26268,2
26268,Received a navy blue one that was not even an option.,26268,2
26268,Disappointed.,26268,2
26269,First of all it's  not like the one pictured.,26269,2
26269,It is all white.,26269,2
26269,The picture looks like there is blue in it.,26269,2
26269,Second I had to take a minute or two to figure out how to put it on.,26269,2
26269,And last but more importantly  it had a hole in the neckline I didn't  even  have  it all the way opened from the packaging  and I noticed it.,26269,2
26269,I like the top and it fits ok.,26269,2
26269,The picture should be updated though.,26269,2
26270,"Very tight, very short.",26270,2
26270,Not enough material around the bottom in regards to length and diameter.,26270,2
26271,I was under the impression that i was to receive the pair (King & Queen) shirt when purchasing.,26271,2
26271,When in fact i only received the Queen shirt.,26271,2
26271,I am originally a size XL but i ordered a 3X to be safe.,26271,2
26271,After receiving i tried the shirt on and it was too snug and too short for my liking.,26271,2
26271,Definitely runs small.,26271,2
26272,Big on shoulders and boxy.,26272,2
26272,It's cute but fits big for an xs.,26272,2
26273,This shirt runs a bit smaller than other brands.,26273,2
26273,The large fits like a size 10.,26273,2
26273,The material is pretty thin and sheer.,26273,2
26273,The side slits are higher than expected.,26273,2
26274,Too small...,26274,2
26275,It is too small.,26275,2
26276,Reminded me of a smock you put on in the dr's office.,26276,2
26276,"I give it two stars for material and price, but this is not a cute blouse.",26276,2
26276,Maybe it only works if you are petite and small like the model?,26276,2
26277,"I ordered my normal size, but the product was too small for me.",26277,2
26278,The necklace itself looks very cheap.,26278,2
26278,I only wore it a couple times before I got rid of it.,26278,2
26278,The individual chains kept getting all twisted and it was too much of a hassle to fix the chains every half hour when I wore the necklace.,26278,2
26278,Honeslty don't waste your money.,26278,2
26278,Also the charms aren't evenly aligned.,26278,2
26278,The triangle charm is slightly off which is fustarting and just makes the necklace look ridiculous.,26278,2
26278,"Spend your money on a better more expensive necklace, not this cheap junk.",26278,2
26279,Won't fit if you have boobs,26279,2
26280,This fit weird,26280,2
26281,This is shorter than I imagined.,26281,2
26281,The opaque white part is really a tube top sort of length.,26281,2
26281,"If that's what you want, though, there aren't any other problems.",26281,2
26282,broke the first 5 min,26282,2
26283,Took over 3 weeks to be delivered.,26283,2
26283,Looks well made but the numbers are small and it's hard to program.,26283,2
26283,I ended up having to to read other reviews to figure out what to do.,26283,2
26283,It's also on the big side for 4th grader,26283,2
26284,"This is a lovely sweater clip, and since I have a broken shoulder, I can't get one arm into my sweaters, so I thought it would be perfect.",26284,2
26284,"Unfortunately, the second time I went to use it one of the clips just totally came apart.",26284,2
26284,I could not repair it so I wasted my money.,26284,2
26284,"It seems to be a good product, and maybe it was just a faulty clip.",26284,2
26284,"If Amazon gave me the opportunity to add a photo, I could show the problem.",26284,2
26285,I always buy these type of shorts.,26285,2
26285,The matieral to me was very different .,26285,2
26285,"Also, shrink easily",26285,2
26286,Too small.,26286,2
26286,Tight fit in the arms and bust.,26286,2
26286,Not as long as I thought it would be.,26286,2
26286,Also the stitch work is terrible.,26286,2
26286,Cheaply made.,26286,2
26287,cute top!,26287,2
26288,Super cute but I'm a size 12 with a 36C bust....it DID NOT FIT.,26288,2
26288,I must return.,26288,2
26288,I'm bummed about it :( too small.,26288,2
26289,Tried to size up based on previous reviews and got an XL even though I'm usually a Medium.,26289,2
26289,The shirt is barely large enough to get on.,26289,2
26289,I wouldnt recommend.,26289,2
26290,Started off slightly small but where I could still wear them.,26290,2
26290,"Once washed , Fugetaboutit.",26290,2
26290,Way too small.,26290,2
26291,"They way the dress is cut, you will pop out.",26291,2
26291,Even the small cups.,26291,2
26292,Color not expected..more a yellow and it was super long!!!,26292,2
26292,And tight in chest area..not true to size,26292,2
26293,To short and the armholes are way to big,26293,2
26294,"Just did not like the way it look on me, the white against the black was not really flattening, it look Cheap",26294,2
26295,I had to give it to my 12 year old sister...,26295,2
26295,The sizing must be Asian...,26295,2
26296,Not what I expected.,26296,2
26296,"Ordered brown ""leather"".",26296,2
26296,Doesn't look or feel like leather.,26296,2
26297,"It's ""ok"".",26297,2
26297,The heart is a little faded already without having washed it.,26297,2
26297,"I thought I would be able to wear it out but I think this will be a ""home shirt"".",26297,2
26298,"Cute, but to small!",26298,2
26299,I love the necklace but the clip was broken when I got it ....... so I can't use it ... till I get a new chain,26299,2
26300,These are not slouchy at all.,26300,2
26300,Very disappointed.,26300,2
26301,Love the design.,26301,2
26301,"Two issues --- one if a problem with the product, one is a problem with me.",26301,2
26301,My issue is that I have a typical man belly and the romones logo looks like a bulls eye on a pumpkin.,26301,2
26301,Can't wear it till I loose some weight.,26301,2
26301,"Don't let that stop you from buying, just sharing how it looks on me.",26301,2
26301,The issue I have with the shirt is the material is really really cheap.,26301,2
26301,More like an under-shirt than a t-shirt.,26301,2
26301,"Overall, great concept poor execution.",26301,2
26302,I will be returning simply because I probably won't wear it more than once.,26302,2
26302,"It was too small
In the back, yet too large on the shoulders.",26302,2
26303,"Beautiful blouse but even though ordered XL,  it was too small.",26303,2
26303,Had to return it.,26303,2
26304,I have a male head and it was too large for me also.,26304,2
26304,"Great in theory, bad in production.",26304,2
26305,Shrunk so much after one wash that it didn't cover my belly anymore and I couldn't wear it.,26305,2
26305,I don't even use hot water for the washer!,26305,2
26306,No way on earth is this a maternity DRESS!,26306,2
26306,It's extremely short for 8/12 sizing.,26306,2
26306,Stopped belt line.,26306,2
26306,I'm keeping it as a shirt.,26306,2
26306,Pretty disappointed!,26306,2
26307,It's small and unujustable...maybe it could fit a 5 year old girl.,26307,2
26308,Made somewhat small and color is not as appears on website (sky blue) its pale blue not bright.,26308,2
26309,Nice looking but made in China so the sizes are off by at least two sizes.,26309,2
26309,No draw string either.,26309,2
26309,If you're looking for these types of pants order them at Lebowskifest dot com.,26309,2
26309,Much much better and true size.,26309,2
26310,The bra part was extremely small and bottom too big I got a XL...,26310,2
26310,Thinking it was going to be small because it's from China,26310,2
26311,"The dress is beautiful, however a size L is a US 6 which was not stated in the description",26311,2
26312,I wear a size 7 in rings and thats what i ordered and it was way to small.,26312,2
26312,It's a nice ring but order it a few sizes bigger.,26312,2
26313,Water can get inside,26313,2
26314,its pretty but does not fit a larger wrist.,26314,2
26315,Poor stitching of zipper.,26315,2
26316,Broke off the first time I wore it.,26316,2
26316,The ends are glued on instead of roped so they snapped off at the slightest tug of my jacket.,26316,2
26316,Pretty though.,26316,2
26317,Bought these for my tendinitis.,26317,2
26317,Wore them for a few months during cycling and walking to/from the car while letting my foot heal.,26317,2
26317,"After two months, took them with me on a trip to DC and my tendinitis flared up pretty badly after just one day of walking around.",26317,2
26317,"Also, don't expect to wear them with Toms or Converse.",26317,2
26317,They won't fit.,26317,2
26318,Made for someone with a very short torso.,26318,2
26318,I'm only 5'2 and it was too short for me.,26318,2
26319,"Well, my order came in early... but the XL is actually a SMALL.",26319,2
26319,"Someone in the reviews made the comment ""You have to get the SMALL in order to get the XL.""",26319,2
26319,"I didn't want to believe it, so I just ordered a XL.",26319,2
26319,"Yeah, I screwed up.",26319,2
26319,"My outfit is the color I ordered, black.",26319,2
26319,But it's a cheap material and WAY too small.,26319,2
26319,"I'm about 180lbs, 42D.",26319,2
26319,Mostly thick in the thighs than anything.,26319,2
26319,"So reading some people say that the shorts were big, I was happy.",26319,2
26319,But READ ALL THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS!,26319,2
26319,That was my mistake.,26319,2
26319,Don't buy.,26319,2
26320,Does not look like the photo at all.,26320,2
26321,"Cheaply made, sent it back.",26321,2
26322,Update: at first I liked the wallet because it was small and compact.,26322,2
26322,"But now after carrying it for a week, it's gotten on my nerves, it's definitely only a front pocket carry wallet(which I don't do front carry).",26322,2
26322,"Every time I sit, I can hear the wallet belt is and sometimes it gets stuck.",26322,2
26322,"The other thing I dislike as well is that with any drop of this wallet, your cards go EVERYWHERE.",26322,2
26322,It's got ZERO drop resistance.,26322,2
26323,Bought this for my daughter and it was a little too tight.,26323,2
26323,Fits on the small side.,26323,2
26324,Cute pajamas!,26324,2
26324,Fit great until you wash them.,26324,2
26324,I ordered two sets and they both shrunk so badly I can't even wear them.,26324,2
26325,"I loved this design, but the material is thin and see through when stretched even the slightest.",26325,2
26325,I couldn't even wear them.,26325,2
26326,Cheap fabric,26326,2
26327,Teeny tiny.,26327,2
26327,I got a large.,26327,2
26327,"I can still wear it because I'm actually a small, but I was hoping for something with more room.",26327,2
26328,the dress was beautiful but I had twin main problems.,26328,2
26328,The dress did not come in on time and it did not fit as expected,26328,2
26329,Very cheap.,26329,2
26329,I bought it for a costume and it fell apart half way through the evening.,26329,2
26330,Bought this as a gift and in the pic it looks like it's fitted.,26330,2
26330,But it's pretty wide almost for a man.,26330,2
26331,3x it looks like,26331,2
26332,"The top is significantly looser around the waist than I expected, not a tight on me at all.",26332,2
26332,"The straps are very short and not adjustable making the neck sit very high and the sides come up into my armpits which, I found uncomfortable.",26332,2
26332,I am only 5'2 so I can only assume this problem would be worse for someone taller.,26332,2
26332,In order to make it fit decently I would have to constantly be pulling it down throughout the day.,26332,2
26332,"While the strap detail is attractive, the pieces are not anchored together in anyway through the woven pattern and therefore the straps twist a lot and are difficult to keep straight.",26332,2
26332,"Needless to say, I will be returning this top.",26332,2
26333,Very tight material and rolls down often.,26333,2
26333,It feels like bad spandex.,26333,2
26334,"Cheap quality, runs small",26334,2
26335,The first time I put it on over my head 2 straps ripped.,26335,2
26335,Cheap!,26335,2
26335,I threw it away!,26335,2
26336,I had skitters before and they were holding my toddler's feet.,26336,2
26336,This one is too louse and slips off sometimes.,26336,2
26336,I have the exact same size from a different color and possibly different  material and the old one was much better quality and better support.,26336,2
26337,"These pants fit perfect, BUT the button fell off when I tried them on.",26337,2
26337,I had to send them back.,26337,2
26337,"I may reorder because I liked them so much, but for now I'm giving two stars because of the quality.",26337,2
26338,Disappointed for it came broken and cannot be fixed.,26338,2
26338,A peice of the metal around the pendant was missing but hope no one will notice it when I wear it,26338,2
26339,"Looks cute in picture, but material is somewhat cheap looking.",26339,2
26340,I have big breasts so these shirts were not ideal.,26340,2
26340,"The V-neck is not as low as I would like, fits like a crew, and because I'm heavy up top, the arm pit area is super tight.",26340,2
26340,"Colors are nice, would not buy again because fit.",26340,2
26341,too heavy plastic,26341,2
26342,Nicely done,26342,2
26343,I got the color jade because my original selection of turquoise was no longer available.,26343,2
26343,I got it just in time to throw in my suitcase for vacation.,26343,2
26343,I was excited to wear it however when I washed it in cold water it bled color all over my other laundry and also shrunk in length.,26343,2
26343,Worst 16.99 ever...cost me more in other damaged clothes.,26343,2
26344,"In the picture here it looks pretty and edge, it's not...",26344,2
26344,"The shoulders are to broad, that gives it a large appearance, although it fits right if you close the zipper.",26344,2
26345,"I was disappointed with this dress, they fabric is cheap and plastic looking with no give to it.",26345,2
26346,It looks like scrubs for medical people.,26346,2
26347,Ugh is all I can say,26347,2
26348,Just a little small,26348,2
26349,Really short and awkwardly cut.,26349,2
26350,Fit is nice on top but small at the bottom.,26350,2
26351,I was so excited when I ordered this.,26351,2
26351,I ordered per the size chart and description.,26351,2
26351,"I received it and tried it on today, way too big.",26351,2
26351,"It also states in the description ""The under suit is fitted like a jumpsuit.",26351,2
26351,"The swimwear covers everything,very flattering"".",26351,2
26351,I disagree.,26351,2
26351,"Very thin, no padding and no bottoms.",26351,2
26351,I guess my mistake was thinking One-Piece was literally like a U.S. one piece swim suit.,26351,2
26351,Well that was totally wrong.,26351,2
26351,"It IS one piece, a one piece top NO BOTTOMS.",26351,2
26351,I knew the price was too good to be true.,26351,2
26351,Now I know why.,26351,2
26352,Way bigger then I had thought.,26352,2
26353,These gloves are kind of silly for summer..,26353,2
26353,"The ""touch screen"" part is what looks like a piece of duct tape on the first finger.",26353,2
26353,I wear them to walk the dogs to protect my skin from UV rays and bruises that happen so easily in my sixties.,26353,2
26353,Gloves for Miss Daisy.,26353,2
26354,The top on the model appears to cover her rear end and is much longer than the top actually is.,26354,2
26354,She must be a very short model as this top only goes a little past my hip.,26354,2
26354,"I was hoping to wear it with leggings, but it's way too short.",26354,2
26354,"(I'm 5' 10"" tall)",26354,2
26355,"Got two pair ,the one was correct size; this one not.",26355,2
26355,Am giving it to a friend..,26355,2
26356,"Very cute, but very short.",26356,2
26357,"It fall apart too easily, but it was easy to put back together",26357,2
26358,I'm exactly six feet tall.,26358,2
26358,I have relatively wide shoulders and a somewhat muscular chest.,26358,2
26358,I bought the large.,26358,2
26358,"This thing fits awful, it feels like I'm wearing a boy's bathrobe, the bathrobe just barely overlaps my torso by about an inch or so, meaning it's pretty much wide open, even with the belt tied around it, defeating the purpose...even more so once I start walking just a few feet down the hall.",26358,2
26358,"The length is okay, better than most bathrobes, but still ends at the bottom of my calf muscles not at the ankles and feet as shown in the picture.",26358,2
26358,"Also, it should be noted that it's 100% polyester.",26358,2
26358,"I'm not sure if I'll return it for a bathrobe that fits better or keep it for guests, there's not much out there that's roomy, large, dark, tall and has long sleeves, unless you want to pay a couple of hundred dollars.",26358,2
26358,"It's not important to me that it's a ""Sith"" robe, I bought it simply because I thought it would be roomy and old style, covering enough for quickly answering the door or getting the mail in the morning type of thing...unfortunately, by the time I get to the door, the family jewels are out there for all the world to see, the fit is too narrow!",26358,2
26358,One last thing: the belt sits way too high on the robe...the belt loops are up near my rib cage rather than down by my waist.,26358,2
26359,cheaply made,26359,2
26360,The scarf is oddly small and very wide.,26360,2
26360,It doesn't sit right on my neck and the buttons are placed very far apart.,26360,2
26360,Unhappy with this purchase.,26360,2
26361,"Very pretty, but way to small-I ordered a large and can't even get into the bottoms.",26361,2
26361,I am 5'8 130lbs,26361,2
26362,My niece is 10 years old and this set (size 12) is way too small.,26362,2
26363,"Too large and bad material, super wrinkly.",26363,2
26364,"Too large, waiting on refund to complete before full review.",26364,2
26365,Very bad quality material.,26365,2
26365,Stitching was not upto the mark.,26365,2
26366,Awkwardly humongous,26366,2
26367,Let me warn everyone considering buying this ear warmer.,26367,2
26367,"It's for young girls, not for adult women.",26367,2
26367,It's really small!,26367,2
26367,"Luckily I was able to sew on a piece of elastic to make it bigger, however, it's still too small because it doesn't cover my ears completely.",26367,2
26367,"I bought this because the description said ""Ladies Girls"", assuming it would fit because I could adjust it.",26367,2
26367,Not the case.,26367,2
26367,"So, with all that being said, buyer beware and measure the circumference of your head if you're considering buying this.",26367,2
26367,"Also, the description says it will stretch.",26367,2
26367,"This is true, but when it stretches, the rhinestone appliqu begins to peel and fall off.",26367,2
26367,"Again, luckily I can sew, I had to stitch the peeling corners back on to the wrap.",26367,2
26368,Material was heavy; more suitable for cooler climates.,26368,2
26369,"As soon as I wen to put them on, they got a whole.. Also, they do not sit on your hip area, and keep rolling down past your tummy.. it is annoying to keep pulling them up.",26369,2
26369,Otherwise cute and fairly thick for tights.,26369,2
26370,"Pretty dress, fit as expected in the bust/waist/hips, but the sleeves are CRAZY tight.",26370,2
26370,"Painfully tight, afraid I'm going to get a blood clot tight.",26370,2
26370,"When the sleeves are so wrong compared to the rest of the dress, I don't think ordering up a size would help.",26370,2
26370,The dress is going back.,26370,2
26371,The ring is prettyand the fit is fine.,26371,2
26371,"However, it is too gaudy for me.",26371,2
26371,I would have liked it if the stones were smaller.,26371,2
26372,I can't seem to get this cap to stay on my head.,26372,2
26372,The lining simply slips off my head.,26372,2
26372,I wanted to like it but it doesn't work for me.,26372,2
26373,Way way too small,26373,2
26374,They do seem to run on the small side.,26374,2
26374,"I received three black, two shades of grey, and a blue hat.",26374,2
26374,I would have returned them for this reason if I hadn't needed them for a Christmas gift.,26374,2
26375,The material is pretty breathable but the size is pretty small despite being a size 32 (Under the recommended size) and they tend to ride up pretty bad.,26375,2
26375,Wore them once and will sadly be retiring these.,26375,2
26376,The earrings are mismatched.,26376,2
26376,"Three Captain America ends, one plain silver.",26376,2
26376,"There's a sort of clear bubble on the shield part to give it a dimensional look which makes it look quite glossy, and not a gauge look at all.",26376,2
26377,Didn't like the fabric.,26377,2
26377,Nice enough but not for me.,26377,2
26377,Returned.,26377,2
26378,So sad ..,26378,2
26378,"Fit too small from the top piece , the bottom piece was too big .",26378,2
26379,"Looks good, but the clamps holding all the cords together are poor.",26379,2
26379,It keeps coming apart.,26379,2
26379,If you never move or don't brush against some it might work.,26379,2
26380,Really small and thin.,26380,2
26381,Top was too big and the bottom was too small.,26381,2
26382,"Might have been a cute tee, but there was a dime size stain or flaw in the middle of it.",26382,2
26382,Returned it.,26382,2
26383,Very cheap-looking and the only reason I did not return is that they were inexpensive.,26383,2
26383,Sometimes you get what you pay for.,26383,2
26384,"Love the texture of these socks, but they do not have a top band around the thigh to keep them in place.",26384,2
26384,These are constantly rolling down in the middle of a routine.,26384,2
26385,Nothing like the picture,26385,2
26386,Very unrealistic.,26386,2
26387,The fringe makes it look like a cheap Halloween costume.,26387,2
26387,It is not very figure fitting at all.,26387,2
26387,Not crazy about it at all.,26387,2
26388,Pretty thin material and you can't really wear it in public with out a bra and when breast feeding the nice thing about nursing tanks is the ease of feeding.,26388,2
26388,But not with this top having to wear a bra under it.,26388,2
26389,"When I got my set of 3, the rose plugs were actually white and I only received one of them instead of 2 like you are suppose to, so good thing I was buying them for the purple and black ones!",26389,2
26390,Very small,26390,2
26391,I can't wear these.,26391,2
26391,They are too narrow to zip up the back without a struggle and can't wait to get home to get out of them.,26391,2
26391,I pried them off downstairs and haven't even bothered to put them away.,26391,2
26391,Too bad.,26391,2
26391,I thought they were really cute.,26391,2
26392,really cute but way too small.,26392,2
26392,im a medium/large and couldn't get the xl zipped up,26392,2
26393,"This is a cute jacket, but was too large for my taste around the waist.",26393,2
26393,I ended up returning it.,26393,2
26394,Kinda cheap.,26394,2
26394,No actual compression.,26394,2
26394,They should change the description.,26394,2
26394,They are basically tight thermals.,26394,2
26394,Light weight thermals.,26394,2
26395,I ordered a 4x but it fits like a 2x.,26395,2
26395,I liked the color.,26395,2
26396,"The size fits just how I expected, however it doesn't look nearly as nice in person as it does in the picture.",26396,2
26396,The top leaf is way shorter and all of the leafs are rounded not pointy.,26396,2
26396,"And the stem on mine looks retarded and is super sharp, I'm afraid it will catch on my clothes and tear them.",26396,2
26397,Didn't care for the material,26397,2
26398,OK little expensive for this type of hat.,26398,2
26399,This thing was freaking huge!,26399,2
26399,Not what I expected.,26399,2
26399,Regretful spending.,26399,2
26400,A little small but I can wear it.,26400,2
26401,"I am 5'11"" 155bs, and wear a 32G, and I have a huge booty.",26401,2
26401,I bought the largest possible size and it was still laughably small.,26401,2
26401,"This happens a lot, so I was not horribly disappointed, but beware if you are at all like me, it's just not the one.",26401,2
26402,So freakin cute but way to freakin small it's like a medium,26402,2
26403,the tress is nice however 2 sizes to small  I reordered it in an extra large when I am a true size 6.  it was inexpensive so I ordered a much larger one.,26403,2
26404,"Huge, not true to size order 2 sizes down way big!",26404,2
26405,The fact that the shoes ran small.,26405,2
26405,He will not get to enjoy them long.,26405,2
26405,Also it took a long time for delivery.,26405,2
26406,The sizing on this was short and squatty.,26406,2
26406,"I'm 5'8"" and it was quite wide and too short.",26406,2
26406,"Additionally, the material is rather see-through and requires an  undershirt.",26406,2
26406,The fabric does not breathe well in hot or humid conditions.,26406,2
26407,"I ordered these for a friend in the UK as she is unable to find her size where she live, she said a size 12 it too small and a 14 too large, so I ordered her the size 13 and was surprised when she said they are too large.",26407,2
26407,She will have to do some alterations as it's risky ordering for someone you haven't seen in years but I tried.,26407,2
26408,I ordered an XL because everyone said it ran small.,26408,2
26408,It does.,26408,2
26408,The XL probably would have worked for me...except for in the chest area.,26408,2
26408,Way too tight.,26408,2
26408,I ended up giving it to my smaller Sister.,26408,2
26408,Looks just like the picture though.,26408,2
26409,"Sent this back, as it was a bag styled more for a man.",26409,2
26410,Like the other reviews not all the stone are real blue mostly gray!,26410,2
26411,Nice bracelets but breaks easily,26411,2
26412,within less than 4 days of giving it as a gift it has broken,26412,2
26413,Tore after wearing 1 day.,26413,2
26414,"It's a large but is tight on my 190 pound,  5'7"" frame.",26414,2
26415,I like that the ring is thin for my husband's small fingers and super lightweight.,26415,2
26415,"My biggest issue is that the grey center, which looks fake and cheap to begin with, protrudes significantly and will be scratched up in no time at all.",26415,2
26415,"Overall, I was just a little disappointed.",26415,2
26416,"I like the set, but I am considering returning them because they don't match.",26416,2
26416,The pendant is darker than the earrings.,26416,2
26417,"Cute bag, but Cheap lining.",26417,2
26417,"It is darker than pictured, but description warned me of that.",26417,2
26417,Did not come with the cute bangle.,26417,2
26417,But worst problem?,26417,2
26417,I got it on Tuesday and by Friday the lining has already ripped!,26417,2
26417,"I could try to repair it, but I don't love it enough to put that kind of work into it.",26417,2
26417,Returning.,26417,2
26418,"Cant get thumb into holes, and won't stay on well.",26418,2
26418,Very cute though - but don't think they'll last until next season (but I'll save them),26418,2
26419,These shoes feel very cheaply made.,26419,2
26419,They are super light and no support what so ever.,26419,2
26419,I think they are very expensive for what you get.,26419,2
26419,Only giving two stars because the print is cute.,26419,2
26420,Too small,26420,2
26421,Was this jacket made for a midget.,26421,2
26421,I ordered xl and it is tight.,26421,2
26421,But I do like itt.,26421,2
26422,I am taller and so one piece suit never did do me right.,26422,2
26422,"Also, the hook for the back was missing the part to hook it into.",26422,2
26423,Cute style.,26423,2
26423,Very small,26423,2
26424,Not what I expected.,26424,2
26424,It feels like a bathingsuit.,26424,2
26424,I thought it would feel like pajamas.,26424,2
26424,I also thought it would be more of a boy shorts fit at the bottom but it wasn't.,26424,2
26424,It's comfy but I can't wear it around the house as I would have liked to,26424,2
26425,First problem.,26425,2
26425,"These say unisex shoes, but the sizing doesn't indicate if they're men's or women's.",26425,2
26425,"It seems to be women's, however they are so heavy and bulky that I can't imagine many women wearing them.",26425,2
26425,I gave them away.,26425,2
26426,Poor quality.,26426,2
26426,Tore within first week wearing them.,26426,2
26426,Spring for something more expensive.,26426,2
26427,Being returned.,26427,2
26427,Beyond small.,26427,2
26427,Barely fits one bra,26427,2
26428,I didn't received the colors that were displayed in the picture.,26428,2
26428,"I received 3 black, dark grey, light grey and a burgundy.",26428,2
26429,Very sassy but runs small,26429,2
26430,"It did fit as expected, however, the material is not what I expected at all.",26430,2
26430,"It appears to be a cotton blend in the photo, but came in a spandex like material.",26430,2
26430,"I was really excited for this to arrive, but when I got it I was highly disappointed in the quality of the material.",26430,2
26430,I went back to read the product description and I was unable to locate material type... (Wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything BC I ALWAYS read description!),26430,2
26430,Would be nice to know the material type .,26430,2
26430,please update...,26430,2
26431,I was super disapointed because almost all of them were repeats and the art was kinda sloppy.,26431,2
26432,I looked at many reviews and decided to take a chance.,26432,2
26432,"The ""wine red"" is more of a fiery orange but the snaps snap and the material is good.",26432,2
26432,"I am 130 lbs, curvy and like to think that I have a booty.",26432,2
26432,This romper was more along the lines of Santa's Long underwear as far as sexy goes.,26432,2
26432,But I will keep it because I am a seamstress and can take the back in 8 inches.,26432,2
26432,"The boos are not tight, the butt area comes like shorts and the collar curves up and out like a sail.",26432,2
26432,"I wanted the tight, sleek look the model has, regardless of the editing done to her, and may buy a smaller size.",26432,2
26433,The fit was not American sizing!,26433,2
26433,"I didn't send it back, I will just give it away!",26433,2
26433,I hate doing returns!,26433,2
26433,"This is why I hate ordering clothes, when I don't know where they are coming from!",26433,2
26434,"I love the case and the frames are really strong,  but I got them yesterday and already have a scratch on them and I haven't even worn them once!",26434,2
26435,"seiously, my husband LAUGHED OUT LOUD when I took this from the package it was so small.",26435,2
26435,Might have fit a 10 year old....a small 10 year old.,26435,2
26435,VERY stretchy but don't cover much when stretched.,26435,2
26435,Sent it back.,26435,2
26436,Doesn't look anything like the picture or model.,26436,2
26436,It's still cute but more for a formal event instead of the club.,26436,2
26437,I wish they would take this picture off because its so misleading.,26437,2
26437,the box is like only 2 squares by 6 and not at all like this picture.,26437,2
26438,I bought a small for my 10 month old and large for my 3 year old and both were too small.,26438,2
26438,"The large does fit my 10 month old though, so at least I'll get good use out of one.",26438,2
26439,"Nice fabric, but too small for this size 14 woman.",26439,2
26440,Instructions are very unclear,26440,2
26441,"while they fit, they are definitely tights not leggings.",26441,2
26441,You cannot wear them without covering your assests unless you want for people to see everything.,26441,2
26441,They also have a chemical odor to them.,26441,2
26442,Well I loved the colors but even though I ordered up it was still way to tight.,26442,2
26442,And not very flattering.,26442,2
26442,I am 67 and take a 1x in things.,26442,2
26442,The worse part was trying to get into it.,26442,2
26442,Omg and getting out was worse.,26442,2
26442,There is no hook its sqeese in and peel off  I'm disappointed because I loved it but it is going back.,26442,2
26442,Also took awhile to come.,26442,2
26442,Also isn't covered in amazon prime so have to pay to ship back although the ad said free shipping.,26442,2
26442,I would not recommend this suit to anyone who is a plus size.,26442,2
26443,Ordered this costume and I received it quickly.,26443,2
26443,Unfortunately as I opened it the pieces stuck together and had lots of discoloration.,26443,2
26443,If it had been just a place or two I wouldn't of cared but over half the skirt was discolored.,26443,2
26443,Kind of disappointed.,26443,2
26444,"Over priced, very cheap quality, I had to return it bc I couldn't swallow the amount I had paid.",26444,2
26444,Should be 2.99$ max not 11.99$ and they jingle annoyingly in yr ears when u move.,26444,2
26445,Silver is rubbing off.,26445,2
26446,"to small, cannot return cause i live in the caribbean, after reading the reviews i truly thought i was buyin my size, its asian size .",26446,2
26446,i bought an xl and it fits like a small.,26446,2
26447,"Love the print, but runs way way too small.",26447,2
26448,"I ordered size ""S"".",26448,2
26448,"I received it and tried it on but it seems to be an ""XL"" size.",26448,2
26448,I have sent it back!,26448,2
26448,"I want to order the same product again with size ""XS"", but I am afraid it would still be too big.",26448,2
26448,Please advise.,26448,2
26449,It's not long enough,26449,2
26450,"I ordered a medium as a present, and received an XL the day before my Husband returned.",26450,2
26450,Not happy.,26450,2
26451,If you are a busty person or have braud shoulders it will be too tight at the chest so you will need to get three sizes bigger.,26451,2
26451,Also the material is extremely see through had to wear tank tops underneath.,26451,2
26452,Very intricate and beautiful dial.,26452,2
26452,Watch is quite accurate.,26452,2
26452,"Case is 16.9 mm thick, not 18mm as listed.",26452,2
26452,Curved mineral crystal very cool.,26452,2
26452,"Sadly, the crown pulled completely out of watch when attempting to set it.",26452,2
26452,Did not pull on it particularly hard...,26452,2
26453,They arrived a little bent and are super small.,26453,2
26453,Didn't want to deal with hassle of returning so im donating them.,26453,2
26453,Meh quality.,26453,2
26454,This shirt is at least two sizes smaller than marked.,26454,2
26454,A boys XL (14-16) is really the size of a typical Medium.,26454,2
26454,If your child needs a size larger than a M then do not buy this.,26454,2
26455,it's not the size per se that doesn't fit.,26455,2
26455,it's the dome of the cap.,26455,2
26455,i'm pretty sure most people will find it has too much space between your scalp and the peak of the cap.,26455,2
26456,Stones are falling out,26456,2
26457,For the price the shoes themself were good quality.,26457,2
26457,The package was later than expected which is why I give the lower rating,26457,2
26458,Ordered Ex Lg but still too small.,26458,2
26458,I wear large!,26458,2
26458,!,26458,2
26459,Great textile.,26459,2
26459,Definitely too large.,26459,2
26460,I am returning this.,26460,2
26460,"For a one size fits all, this is very small in the chest area.",26460,2
26460,"Its also kinda thin, especially in the straps.",26460,2
26460,"It barely covered in back, maybe because all the room was taken up in chest ( and i don't have a big chest, just average c) .",26460,2
26460,"I am 5 ft 7, 160 lbs, size 8-10.",26460,2
26461,Pretty dress but runs way to large,26461,2
26462,Awful smell coming from the clothes the tee shirt  doesn't match the 1st picture but more the second.,26462,2
26462,Really thin fabric.,26462,2
26462,Came really fast and fit my son perfectly a size 2 for a almost 2years old.,26462,2
26463,Not very flattering or comfortable.,26463,2
26463,I ordered a large and they are tiny.,26463,2
26463,Would not recommend,26463,2
26464,"cheap, thin material.",26464,2
26464,I would not buy again.,26464,2
26465,The top of this suit looks very cheap.,26465,2
26465,"Bottoms were cute, but didn't make up for the chintzy top.",26465,2
26466,Sizes run pretty small the waist band is way too tight and cuts into my skin the length and legs are as expected it's the waistband that's the problem,26466,2
26467,Color was aweful!,26467,2
26467,I think mine must have been on top of some stack that sat in the sun or something.,26467,2
26467,"I am going to keep it, but I am going to make it into a project.",26467,2
26467,"It is way darker than expected, except where it is faded.",26467,2
26467,"It will be cool to tie dye or something I guess, we will see.",26467,2
26468,Fit was much smaller than the size chart indicated.,26468,2
26468,"My daughter is 4'10"" and weighs 90 pounds.",26468,2
26468,We got the small expecting it to be big on her.,26468,2
26468,"The length of the arms and legs hit her EXACTLY at her wrists and ankles, but the arm circumference and chest width are tight on her.",26468,2
26468,Crotch length is extremely long and make walking difficult.,26468,2
26468,"If she tries to run in it, she trips.",26468,2
26468,I would not buy from this company again.,26468,2
26469,It seems to be made for long waists.,26469,2
26469,I returned it with no issues.,26469,2
26470,"Fit is very small, and narrow at the hips.",26470,2
26470,Material is very thin and not as thick or of good as quality as I would like.,26470,2
26471,"Nice material but no support in the ""so called"" bra.",26471,2
26471,"When I swam in it after stitching it for support, the bra pads inflated to help me float.",26471,2
26471,Added benefit....lol,26471,2
26472,It shrank and wrinkled terribly when I washed it on gentle and dried it on low.,26472,2
26472,I will never wear this.,26472,2
26473,I was not aware that this bag was as tiny as it was.,26473,2
26473,It looks almost more like something you would get to play with a baby doll instead of an actual backpack.,26473,2
26473,"Also it must have been stored in a damp environment, a basement, or something like that because when I received it for my daughter for Christmas it smelled of mold.",26473,2
26474,Proportions on the dress are not as pictured.,26474,2
26474,Dress is pretty short and I have short legs to begin with.,26474,2
26474,The top layer is completely see through and the slip under it is much shorter and still a bit see-through.,26474,2
26475,Not happy,26475,2
26476,I returned this because it had a rip in the arm when I first got it and it was too small in the arms.,26476,2
26476,Very tight on.,26476,2
26476,Very disappointed.,26476,2
26477,Colorful fun designs but they shrank so much that I have trouble getting them on after only one washing.,26477,2
26478,Would look so good if they made it normal women sizes lol.,26478,2
26478,The large/XL top was literally just a nipple covering.,26478,2
26478,The bottoms wouldn't even come over my thighs.,26478,2
26479,RETURNED,26479,2
26480,The photo shows a regular length shirt.,26480,2
26480,I ordered a couple sizes larger to be sure it would fit since it is cheaper and would probably run small.,26480,2
26480,What I received was a shirt that is simultaneous huge (width) and small (short).,26480,2
26480,It's pretty much an unflatteringly wide crop top.,26480,2
26481,I believe they did not lable this jacket properly.,26481,2
26481,They had it labeled as a 3x and I was unable to even get a arm into the sleve and the entire jacket was extremely small.,26481,2
26481,Must have been a child 3x.,26481,2
26482,The top is crazy big.,26482,2
26482,I'm a 36C and the top was fluttery under the arms.,26482,2
26482,I felt like I'd need to be a D or DD to fit into it.,26482,2
26482,It's just a really awkward cut.,26482,2
26483,for a girl not a woman..very small and tight.,26483,2
26483,I am a size 4 somade me look fat.,26483,2
26484,Ordetrd the right suze but it wad wat to small,26484,2
26485,"I'm pretty sure that I read this would not be US sizing, so I ordered larger.",26485,2
26485,It came too big.,26485,2
26485,US sizing after all.,26485,2
26485,Sigh.,26485,2
26486,Super cheap quality.,26486,2
26486,It fits snuggly and provides virtually no support.,26486,2
26487,This top is awful.,26487,2
26487,The top portion fit way too small (was NOT off the shoulder at all) but the rest was HUGE on me.,26487,2
26487,It looked like a blue garbage bag on me.,26487,2
26487,"Also, the material was not what I was expecting at all, further enabling the ""garbage bag"" look.",26487,2
26487,The only reason for my extra star is the customer service was great when I returned the product.,26487,2
26488,"Poorly made, hanging threads on the onesies that you'll have to cut..",26488,2
26488,Took forever to come in the mail as well.,26488,2
26489,Quality is questionable.,26489,2
26489,"Size, well I bought it for my girlfriend.",26489,2
26489,It safe to say that the sizes are definitely asian.,26489,2
26489,Just keep that in mind when purchasing.,26489,2
26489,So an american small is like a medium/large for this shirt.,26489,2
26489,"It did look nice, but easy to tear at seem, hence the quality is questionable.",26489,2
26490,ran small,26490,2
26491,Package arrived quickly and was well wrapped.,26491,2
26491,Ordered two tank tops in size 2.,26491,2
26491,Colors were nice but material was heavy and material seemed tight.,26491,2
26491,The bottom of the tank top is starting to curl and exposing my child's stomach with the navy one.,26491,2
26491,"The rose one fits much better, as it's not as tight and seems to be longer.",26491,2
26491,Two stars for navy and 4 stars for rose.,26491,2
26492,"Nice, but child like small.",26492,2
26493,i like the design but it runs small and after a few washings it faded out.,26493,2
26494,its not that it is exactly too small but on one foot it keeps slide off.,26494,2
26495,Not real Sterling silver I likes the size but they made my ears sore I have to have real silver for my ears their sensitive.,26495,2
26496,Be careful and look closely at the pictures.,26496,2
26496,I searched for Casio watches and was presented this as one of the options.,26496,2
26496,"If you look closely at the pictures, you will see that the logo on the face of the watch is blurred.",26496,2
26496,IT IS NOT A CASIO.,26496,2
26496,Shipping was great; it arrived as expected.,26496,2
26496,I will update my review shortly based on how it performs.,26496,2
26497,"Obviously super adorable on any infant/toddler, however when I put them on my little sister the bow immediately came off.",26497,2
26497,:( they're all sewed on by a single tiny thin string - how do they not expect a one year old to tug on it?,26497,2
26497,Wish they lasted longer.,26497,2
26498,It does not look like the picture.,26498,2
26498,I order the size according to my measurement and it's about 3 size bigger than what I needed.,26498,2
26498,The quality of the dress is not that great.,26498,2
26498,The only reason why I'm giving it a 2 stars is because I received it fast .,26498,2
26499,Buckle broke already after one month of wearing.,26499,2
26499,I wouldn't buy again.,26499,2
26499,Like the concept but quality was poor.,26499,2
26500,The grip doesn't hold my sweater very well at all.,26500,2
26501,"Foot odor is as good as gone, which is really neat.",26501,2
26501,"However, the sweat, which for me is a more pressing issue, has not changed at all.",26501,2
26501,"I commend whomever's sweat has been curbed by these insoles, but I cannot share in that experience.",26501,2
26501,**updating my review to mention that I do not like the residual smell that has since wafted in my shoes.,26501,2
26501,"I have actually replaced my shoes since, partially because of this problem.",26501,2
26502,Very big it cannot be Medium Size,26502,2
26503,Loved color byt to complicated to put on.,26503,2
26504,Haven't been able to get watch to synchronize.,26504,2
26504,"It looks good, and (set manually) seems to keep time ok. Manual organization is confusing.",26504,2
26504,"That, combined with microscopic print, makes it tough to follow.",26504,2
26504,"Two days on the charging light source to ""full,"" but highest bar only lasted a day or so.",26504,2
26504,Back on charger tonight.,26504,2
26505,material is too thin and the size fits way too small,26505,2
26506,The quality was not good for this product.,26506,2
26506,"For the price it is okay, but a better quality duplicate can be purchased at H&M for $5.",26506,2
26507,Side stone missing and side stones set crooked.,26507,2
26508,This product runs very short in the abdominal area.,26508,2
26509,Too small.,26509,2
26509,I guess I ordered the wrong size :(,26509,2
26510,The sole was too thin and narrow.,26510,2
26511,Nice concept but not for bigger butt women,26511,2
26512,Buying from China takes forever to get.,26512,2
26512,Strings are too large and front is too small,26512,2
26513,"Very, very thin material.",26513,2
26514,Cute bathing suit but not true to size at all.,26514,2
26514,I looked at the size chart and it does not compare.,26514,2
26514,It's about 2 sizes too small,26514,2
26515,This shirt is scratchy and does not fit well at all.,26515,2
26515,I am an athlete so I am used to things not fitting around my traps and delts but even following their sizing guide this is ridiculous.,26515,2
26515,I am incredibly disappointed because I really wanted to like this shirt.,26515,2
26516,A lot smaller then I expected will still work as a side bag for my niece luckily.,26516,2
26516,My biggest issue is a piece is already loose and ready to fall off.,26516,2
26516,Then there is the weird displaced one eyed sheeps eye?,26516,2
26516,?,26516,2
26517,"a bit dissapointment because I thought the saying ""beer, lime & sunshine"" was in black colored font.",26517,2
26517,It is actually a light brown color.,26517,2
26517,"Other then that, it's a cool shirt",26517,2
26518,So difficult to keep on.,26518,2
26519,It was marked as LARGE.,26519,2
26519,It might fit an  8-year-old!,26519,2
26520,These pants looked great when they arrived but the color faded after one washing.,26520,2
26521,"Very pretty, but cheaply made.",26521,2
26522,Very cheaply made...,26522,2
26523,"This umbrella, while adorable, is very poorly made.",26523,2
26523,It arrived in a dented box with a severly dented handle.,26523,2
26523,"When I tried to pull it out of the box and gently straighten the huge bend in the pole, it snapped in my hands and gave me a pretty bad cut on my hand.",26523,2
26523,It also came very dusty.,26523,2
26523,Very disappointed.,26523,2
26524,The fit is off.,26524,2
26524,It runs very small,26524,2
26525,I love the style and color of the dress but when it arrived and I tried it on it was a size too small.,26525,2
26525,The size chart provided with this dress is not accurate.,26525,2
26525,I recommend ordering a size up if you want this dress to fit.,26525,2
26526,"I'm 5'8, and this thing is so short in the body that it would cut me in half if I managed to get it over my shoulders.",26526,2
26526,"I'm bummed, because it's really cute otherwise.",26526,2
26527,Socks are thin and scratchy.,26527,2
26527,The heel also slides down fairly easily so the socks end up bunched up inside shoes.,26527,2
26527,Would not buy again.,26527,2
26527,As an UPDATE - the sellers contacted me after reading my review and offered me a partial refund which was a nice gesture.,26527,2
26528,The frame is sturdy.,26528,2
26528,But I don't like that the words are just a stick on decal that can be peeled off.,26528,2
26528,Was disappointed.,26528,2
26529,Quality was cheap.,26529,2
26529,Light too brights couldn't see.,26529,2
26530,I love this...but it is soooo big!!!,26530,2
26530,I got the 0-9 month size for my gigantic 19 pound 6 month old and he won't be able to wear this until he's 2!!!,26530,2
26530,I would send it back but I'm not sending it all the way back to China.,26530,2
26531,The necklace broke the first time I wore it.,26531,2
26531,The cloth by the clasp frayed and fell apart within an hour of wearing it out.,26531,2
26531,Cute necklace but very cheap quality.,26531,2
26531,The triangle fell off and got lost too.,26531,2
26531,Can I get a replacement please?,26531,2
26532,"Not nearly as nice quality fabric as I expected, and very see through.",26532,2
26533,cheap fabric and a bit too small.,26533,2
26533,love the pattern though,26533,2
26534,"2 stars because they look great, but they literally broke on my face... happened twice.",26534,2
26534,look elsewhere.,26534,2
26535,I'm not of fan of the sizing.,26535,2
26535,Its made to be extremely tight through the body and I prefer my nightgowns to be loose fit.,26535,2
26536,Product is long....,26536,2
26536,"I am 5'3"" and the bottom was practically on my ankles.",26536,2
26536,It was also kinda baggy done there and wasn't comfortable to walk it.,26536,2
26536,I returned it.,26536,2
26536,Good material though had it fit correctly I would have kept it.,26536,2
26537,The padding in the bust was way too much!,26537,2
26537,Returned it!,26537,2
26537,The rest of the suit fit well.,26537,2
26538,Broke within a week.,26538,2
26539,Its a nice dress but the material is  very  thin and the dress is to long.,26539,2
26539,im 5'11 and the dress went way pass my knees.,26539,2
26539,"The sizing was true to its size, im 160 pds and i took a medium and it fit ok.",26539,2
26540,This jumpsuit runs very very small.,26540,2
26541,Im a B/C cup ..chest falls out really easy,26541,2
26542,I bought these for my wife who has certain textile allergies.,26542,2
26542,"She said they are definitely comfortable, but they are absolutely NOT 100% cotton.",26542,2
26542,"More research confirmed on their actual website when it states: MATERIALS:combed cotton 80%, spandex 17%, elastane 3% for this particular set.",26542,2
26542,Check out ggoragne dot com.,26542,2
26542,Not happy...,26542,2
26543,This product is a nice material but runs way too small.,26543,2
26544,This hat looked as expected.,26544,2
26544,The fabric was thick and not the most comfortable.,26544,2
26544,I wore it 4 different times.,26544,2
26544,Each of those times I had it on and off for a couple of hours.,26544,2
26544,The total amount of time I wore the hat was probably 8 hours.,26544,2
26544,The hat started to unravel on the fourth time I wore it.,26544,2
26544,I wouldn't recommend this hat even for the price because it wound up in the trash soon after I bought it.,26544,2
26545,"Very good purse, very good quality because of its material, but one of the hanger broke the first 15 days I used it.",26545,2
26546,"The tee itself is very soft and true to size, however the ""screening"" is actually an iron-on...EXTREMELY DULL COLORS and BLURRY as if it was a small photo just blown up way too large to maintain detail integrity!",26546,2
26546,Definitely a cheap quality knock-off of a licensed original...NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,26546,2
26546,"Rather than an awesome birthday gift, as was my intention, it became a pricy gym/sleeping shirt for me...would never give anything this low quality as a gift..gave 2 stars because it is so very soft....",26546,2
26547,Alrighr,26547,2
26548,I love the lens but the frame does not fit my face.,26548,2
26548,It cuts into the sides of my nose after a few minutes of wearing it.,26548,2
26548,"Also, it did not come with microfiber cloth as advertised.",26548,2
26548,I have sent this back and ordered from HSN the original HD sunglasses which I have used and loved them.,26548,2
26549,Really cute but way too small for me.,26549,2
26550,It is a very nice slouchy beanie but it is somewhat large.,26550,2
26551,The only good thing is that It's the perfect size especially considering my nose is pretty small.,26551,2
26551,"Other than that, It was only one which was upsetting because the pic clearly shows 2.",26551,2
26551,It wasn't long before the gold came off which was irritating because it left gold flakes all over my face.,26551,2
26552,The top isn't made like it looks in the pictures.,26552,2
26552,Makes your boobs look egg shaped!,26552,2
26552,Lol.,26552,2
26552,Bottoms are nice however,26552,2
26553,"I have 40"" chest and a lean biker rider build its a tight fit and looks better than the matching tight pants (which I hoped would not be the same pair I bought off of Sammydress.com's website- at half the price)",26553,2
26554,"I loved the wallet, until the wristlet clip snapped in two after having used it all of about 2 weeks.",26554,2
26555,Sizing is wayyyyyyyy off!,26555,2
26555,"Much to small, and the fabric is scratchy.",26555,2
26556,"Started to change colors,  look more lite pink only worn it a few times.",26556,2
26556,Now I don't just leave it in my jewelry box,26556,2
26557,"Pocket is partially under my arm, shirt too large.",26557,2
26557,Not as thick as I thought it would be.,26557,2
26558,Too short,26558,2
26559,"Started out pretty happy with these, but after a few weeks of use, my ears turned green, and became very sore.",26559,2
26559,"When I checked my poor daughter's ears, who was also wearing a pair, I found crusty, pussy sores created by the earrings!",26559,2
26559,Very sad!,26559,2
26560,"The arms are too short, and to return it, you must mail it to the UK.",26560,2
26560,I gave it to a friend.,26560,2
26561,Looks fabulous online!,26561,2
26561,Not as beautiful in person.,26561,2
26561,Thin material.,26561,2
26561,Stitching off.,26561,2
26561,Pieces of thread sticking out.,26561,2
26561,The white part isn't white and not pretty in person.,26561,2
26561,"Otherwise,the dress would be nice.",26561,2
26562,"This looks really cute once it's on, but it's very poorly made and was VERY hard to get on.",26562,2
26562,"There's no zipper or snap crotch or anything, so you have to fit your whole body through the neck hole at the top - for reference, I'm 5'8"", 145lbs, and wear a size 8 jeans.",26562,2
26562,"One of the connectors that holds the string in the middle popped off when I was trying it on initially, which was disappointing.",26562,2
26562,"I sewed it back on and added a zipper in the back to get it on and off more easily, which saved the piece in my opinion.",26562,2
26563,"Mine was supplied by Trenz Shirt Company, fulfilled by Amazon, and let me start off by stating ""GOOD GRIEF!""",26563,2
26563,"This one would fit a very, VERY large head.",26563,2
26563,I've never quite had a cap in my possession that would fit a watermelon head...but this one would.,26563,2
26563,My guess is that the problem lies either with the supplier or I got an odd ball.,26563,2
26563,"Otherwise, I love the colors!",26563,2
26564,I returned this belt.,26564,2
26564,The image shows an orange belt.,26564,2
26564,Orange like an orange.,26564,2
26564,What arrived was a brown belt with a subtle orange-y tint.,26564,2
26564,Not orange at all really.,26564,2
26564,"The description also said the buckle was ""Polished Metal copper buckle"".",26564,2
26564,The image shows a brass buckle and when the belt arrived there is no copper to be found - just a cheap-o looking buckle.,26564,2
26564,"The leather was decent - rough on the inside, smooth outside - and what I expected based on other reviews.",26564,2
26564,The sizing was as expected.,26564,2
26564,Guess I'll keep shopping for an orange belt.,26564,2
26565,Very disappointed.,26565,2
26565,Dress came in a envelope bag all wrinkled.,26565,2
26565,No care label.,26565,2
26565,Material was something like a Halloween costume would be made out of.,26565,2
26565,Beads were barely on with 2 little threads.,26565,2
26565,It looks very pretty in the picture but not at all like the picture.,26565,2
26566,too heavy plastic,26566,2
26567,Got them before delivering date but they don't look like the pic I guess ok for price,26567,2
26568,A bit disappointed.,26568,2
26568,"The color is much darker than I expected, though that isn't a big issue.",26568,2
26568,I am more disappointed with the quality.,26568,2
26568,"There ar two sharp edges on mine from where the moon was likely broken off from the mold- not really sure, but there's also no finish on those broken edges.",26568,2
26568,It is going to snag on a lot of my clothing and it looks bad.,26568,2
26569,Way to big,26569,2
26570,not at ALL like the picture.,26570,2
26570,In person it is really cheap looking.,26570,2
26571,Too small for me.,26571,2
26571,Daughter liked them though.,26571,2
26572,"I'm 5'3"" and it was too short for me :(
I read the other reviews and saw that a few other people who were 5'2"" or a bit shorter got an XL and it fit them perfectly... since I'm only an inch taller than 5'2"" I ordered the XL as well.",26572,2
26572,"I have an average length torso and small breasts, but when I had the swimsuit on I felt uncomfortable.. the bottom of the suit was pulling up and the top part was pulling down.",26572,2
26572,"I love the design and color, but I just wish the midsection piece was a bit longer :/",26572,2
26573,Feels and looks cheap.,26573,2
26573,"Plus the fit is small, it feels very tight around the chest.",26573,2
26573,"Overall, disappointed.",26573,2
26573,"Update:
I contacted the seller, they have good customer service.",26573,2
26573,"They didn't want me to return the dress as it is too expensive to send back to China, but they offered to send me another item.",26573,2
26573,"I asked for the same dress in the next size up, which they obligingly sent me.",26573,2
26573,"Now the dress fits, however it is defective, the seam on the left side is uneven and looks bad - not sure if I'll be able to wear it...",26573,2
26573,Guess it was not meant to be.,26573,2
26574,Fit was terrible,26574,2
26575,"It's very large width wise, and there's no real support in the cups",26575,2
26576,Very tight in the chest area.,26576,2
26576,"Also I am only 5'5"" and it barely covers my butt.",26576,2
26576,This didn't look like a dress to me.,26576,2
26576,"It is exactly like the picture, but it is way too small even when you order a size up.",26576,2
26577,Fitted nicely.,26577,2
26577,"However, the toe area of one of the sandals started peeling leaving a scruffy appearance after the first wear.",26577,2
26578,I'm confused why this is a counterfeit item.,26578,2
26578,"It has a skip hop tag, but it is clearly not skip hop.",26578,2
26578,"It's sort of large but sometimes it's nice when it's a little bigger, even for a tiny baby.",26578,2
26579,I Liked It But It Had A Hole In It When I Got It..,26579,2
26580,The style and fit is nice but the material is horrible !,26580,2
26580,"Looks so cheap , thought it'd be silk like but far from that it's like a spandex type of material .",26580,2
26580,The color is off.,26580,2
26580,I ordered a green color which is more of a light mint green rather than an emerald / sea green .,26580,2
26580,"I'm 152 lbs , 5'3"" , 34A & 28 waist --- ordered a small",26580,2
26581,I bought the next size up just in case and still were too small,26581,2
26582,"The sleeves are way to short, it is not the same as the picture!",26582,2
26583,Cudtumer service sucks glasses ok,26583,2
26584,The floral pattern is nice but overall I do not like this top.,26584,2
26584,It is not flattering as others say.,26584,2
26584,"And the material, I felt would not last long.",26584,2
26584,"You know how a sweater type top that you may have, and you wash it a few times then it starts to lose its shape and thins out and is just kind of blah?",26584,2
26584,"Well, this top comes like that.",26584,2
26584,So imagine having to wash this as a brand new item.,26584,2
26584,Blech.,26584,2
26584,I ordered it one size larger because I wanted to wear like a collar shirt under or just layer it with other pieces but it was so so big even for one size up.,26584,2
26584,"If the material was nice enough, I would've ordered one in my regular size.",26584,2
26585,Runs WAY too small.,26585,2
26585,Don't see other sizes listed to purchase.,26585,2
26586,"Arms Runs small, It looks like a Mans shirt not cut for a lady's figure what so ever
At first i laughed Really thought they sent me a mans shirt
I thought ok i will just sleep in it But then the arms ran sooo small soooo
I ended up giving it to my neice",26586,2
26587,I'm a Momo fanatic and that's the only shoe that fits my daughter's thick feet.,26587,2
26587,This particular style has not met my expectations.,26587,2
26587,"After only a couple wears, there are strings popping out at several areas and the silver stripes have shed their color in spots.",26587,2
26587,"More importantly, she is getting blisters and red spots everywhere.",26587,2
26587,They may be a tiny bit smaller than the Mary Jane style Momos.,26587,2
26587,"I'll still buy Momos, but never this sneaker style again.",26587,2
26588,Loved this jumpsuit.,26588,2
26588,It versatile and can be worn with nice flat sandals or dressed up with heels.,26588,2
26588,Fits very well.,26588,2
26589,The shorts run small but they are still pretty good quality.,26589,2
26589,The major downside is that the logo literally started peeling off right as I was putting them on.,26589,2
26589,You can tell it was a cheap iron on.,26589,2
26590,The feel of the fabric was fine but the sizing was way off by American measurements.,26590,2
26590,XL was way too small.,26590,2
26591,"Poor quality, broke within a week, but looks awesome, wife loved it at first",26591,2
26592,"odd thing about these, they came as 2 pack, white ones are comfy and roomy.",26592,2
26592,"black ones are soooo uncomfortable, the straps on top are tight and dig in to tops of your feet.",26592,2
26592,"So, I want to keep the whites and return the blacks but I don't think it works that way.",26592,2
26592,"Also, this is not my first pair of Tony's sandals, they really do have a nice arch support considering they are flip flops.",26592,2
26593,Not what I expected.. Way to small and short,26593,2
26594,Very heavy,26594,2
26595,I ordered a small and received a medium.,26595,2
26595,Top was too loose and so was skirt.,26595,2
26596,It was transferred to one of my daghters.,26596,2
26596,It was expected to be for my wife.,26596,2
26597,its good i just don't like the fact that people would noticed if you wearing it because of the chest pops up,26597,2
26598,"Cheap, Chinese sweat shop quality.",26598,2
26598,I have several beefs with these toe socks.,26598,2
26598,Maybe I am spoiled since my first few pair of toe socks were the injinji brand (which btw are absolutely amazing i nthe realm of socks!),26598,2
26598,BUT these just scream cheap.,26598,2
26598,"First, they arrive as pictured each pair individually wrapped & packaged which is completely wasteful and made me feel like very wasteful having to unpack age each pair and toss a completely unnecessary amount of packaging.",26598,2
26598,"As for fitment, these are horrible, the little toe never comes close to lining up and it takes me almost 4x as long to put these on as it should.",26598,2
26598,They are thin and get crusty very quickly.,26598,2
26598,For the money i would HIGHLY suggest buying 2 or 3 pairs of quality socks and forgoing these.,26598,2
26599,Love colors that's why I bought it -- most definitely should let us choose top n bottom sizes -- I'm small bottom n medium top -- was surprised at *METAL * clasps I wonder how HOT  they will get or -- RUST -- n ruin suit -- PLASTIC only !,26599,2
26599,!,26599,2
26599,I'm happy it is inexpensive,26599,2
26600,Shipping was fast.,26600,2
26600,"As soon as I ordered it, they emailed me asking for my measurments.",26600,2
26600,"Measured twice, sent once.",26600,2
26600,Dress came in the mail.,26600,2
26600,Tried it on.,26600,2
26600,"It was too small in the bust, so small I could only zip it up half way.",26600,2
26600,"Strange, because I sent my measurments.",26600,2
26600,"Sewn into the bust are cardboard ""cups""
Extremely unflattering.",26600,2
26600,"The ""ruffles"" on the bottom make the dress look cheesy and cheap, not near as cute as in the picture.",26600,2
26600,"Also, it's made to look like it's from a bridal shop in America.",26600,2
26600,"When the dress arrived, it said permanent export from Bejing.",26600,2
26600,Non-returnable or refundable.,26600,2
26600,GRRR!,26600,2
26600,Now I have to find a new dress for my son's wedding.,26600,2
26600,My seamstress can't fix it.,26600,2
26600,Do not recommend buying this.,26600,2
26601,Cute dress but sizing is way off.,26601,2
26602,Need to return.,26602,2
26602,The top does not fit will.,26602,2
26602,It does not lay flat on the sides.,26602,2
26602,Need to return this.,26602,2
26603,I wanted to love these.,26603,2
26603,My little one has eczema and I had hoped these would keep him from scratching during sleep.,26603,2
26603,I suppose they did a bit.,26603,2
26603,However he got them off fairly easily.,26603,2
26603,Like others said the Velcro has sharp edges in places and I can see how it could potentially scratch baby too.,26603,2
26603,"The plain fabric is nice and soft, but developed those fabric pills very quickly after washing.",26603,2
26603,They are just okay in my opinion.,26603,2
26603,I actually found socks to work better though.,26603,2
26604,Felt was very cheap and was permanently wrinkled/ridged across top of hat.,26604,2
26604,Overall very sloppy and cheap looking.,26604,2
26605,The cloth was not really chamois.,26605,2
26605,I didn't like the hand on it (feel of the cloth).,26605,2
26605,I returned it.,26605,2
26606,"These shoes look very cheap, you would think that for $11.99 they would look a lot better.",26606,2
26606,"I seriously wouldn't recommend them, the actual shoes look very different from the picture.",26606,2
26607,I ordered a medium based on mixed reviews of size.,26607,2
26607,I normally wear a medium.,26607,2
26607,"5'5"" 145 lbs.",26607,2
26607,This shirt was more snug in my waist area than I cared.,26607,2
26607,The material is lightweight.,26607,2
26607,I want to return but evidently I pay for return shipping.,26607,2
26607,Be sure to check where your shirt will come from.,26607,2
26607,Not all colors are free returns.,26607,2
26607,"As for colors, I first thought I ordered two of the same shirts.",26607,2
26607,"However, I got a black and a navy.",26607,2
26607,They are very close in color and need bright light to determine which is black and which is navy.,26607,2
26608,Cute but stitching unraveled after one wash.,26608,2
26609,I'm 5'6'' 150lb  36C bra size.,26609,2
26609,Usually  size 6.,26609,2
26609,I really don't know where to start.,26609,2
26609,"It's not a dress, it's shirt.",26609,2
26609,"Very short in the front, will not cover your underwear, back is very short too.",26609,2
26609,"And it's see thru, even with the lining.",26609,2
26609,At least in white color.,26609,2
26609,"I ordered small, because it's loose fit,(and previous reviews) and it's somewhat tight thru my chest.",26609,2
26609,"Not really that big concern for me, because I'm loosing weight, but still.",26609,2
26609,Feels like wearing sheet.,26609,2
26609,"Totally not worth it, cheap looking.",26609,2
26609,Bo,26609,2
26610,"Ordered L, arms seem to fit smaller.",26610,2
26611,"Does not fit, shot on the pelvis area",26611,2
26612,Does a very poor job of protecting carotid arteries from throwing stars and other miscellaneous sharp-edged projectiles.,26612,2
26612,"Unfortunately, my late wife found this out the hard way.",26612,2
26612,And what the heck sort of name is TitFus?,26612,2
26613,Fabric feels like a tarp,26613,2
26614,I was not happy with this tshirt.,26614,2
26614,After washing only twice it started falling apart like the material was sun rotted.,26614,2
26614,I would not recommend or buy again!!!,26614,2
26614,!,26614,2
26615,Gloves had holes in multiple places.. Scarf and gloves looked great,26615,2
26616,I retuned it.,26616,2
26617,Not exactly the color I was going for- it won't be a daily belt for sure.,26617,2
26618,Quality not too good and sizing is way off,26618,2
26619,This rosary didn't last very long.,26619,2
26619,The cross broke off in the first month when I tried to tighten it a bit since the cord was frizzing and unloosing from the hook.,26619,2
26619,"It was also a lot bigger than I had expected, definite made for a mans hand size but not with much strength.",26619,2
26620,Did not like quality,26620,2
26621, Too big,26621,2
26622,It feels like a cheap piece of leather.,26622,2
26622,And there's no clear slot for ID.,26622,2
26622,No idea how its rfid protected.,26622,2
26622,It's thinner than a regular wallet.,26622,2
26622,I don't like it.,26622,2
26623,It is nice elegant but is for thinny persons very very small,26623,2
26624,The socks dont't come up past the knee as pictured.,26624,2
26625,Didn't appear the same in person.,26625,2
26626,Really liked these pants but they don't stretch as much so they were too small,26626,2
26627,Although I followed sizing chart this was way too large.,26627,2
26627,I am a size 6/8 I ordered a small.,26627,2
26627,When I tried it on it was way too over-sized it looked like I was wearing a misshapen sack.,26627,2
26627,"I gave this to a co-worker who is a size 18-20  it fits her beautifully, still over-sized enough to have the flowing appearance but much more flattering on her shape.",26627,2
26628,too small and there is no support.,26628,2
26628,"I should say my victoria secret size in 34 DDD, so it is exptreemly difficult to find strepless bra.",26628,2
26628,I decided to try this one.,26628,2
26629,Very cheap material.,26629,2
26629,Dull colors as opposed to the photo provided.,26629,2
26629,Completely different designs,26629,2
26630,Not what I expected.,26630,2
26630,Very thin.,26630,2
26631,Way too big and doesn't fit like it does in the picture,26631,2
26632,The top fits good but was not like photo.,26632,2
26632,It is a different shirt.,26632,2
26632,I would not recommend,26632,2
26633,top wayyyyyy tooooo smalll.,26633,2
26633,don't bother,26633,2
26634,Very cute but was way too big and didn't stay in place.,26634,2
26635,It tarnishes really bad.,26635,2
26636,Very small sizes and the grommets barely lasted two weeks before they started falling out.,26636,2
26637,too small in top of body lots of side boob hanging out,26637,2
26638,They were broke when they got to me.,26638,2
26638,But shipped really fast and they look great!,26638,2
26639,Fit somewhat well and was a pretty royal blue but the beading is completely different from the picture.,26639,2
26639,"The beading looks cheap, we had to send it back.",26639,2
26640,Product arrived ripped/frayed and threads appear to have been pulled out of parts of the fabric - not very pretty because of the defects.,26640,2
26640,The hat itself is a pretty design.,26640,2
26640,Definitely too much glue used to attach the makeshift-flower pile.,26640,2
26640,The adornment is not pretty and pretty flat.,26640,2
26640,Love the grey color because it is subtle and can go with a lot of outfits.,26640,2
26640,"I am going to call amazon.com to arrange for an exchange as I am not able to do that when I tried to return the item, only refund is offered.",26640,2
26640,"I want this hat and I want it at the lightning deal price I paid so I want an exchange, will update my review if that goes through.",26640,2
26641,Pretty chintzy but it was cheap so I won't complain too badly.,26641,2
26641,The lace ripped first day and the thin pads inside aren't symmetrical.,26641,2
26641,I basically wore it twice and then threw it away.,26641,2
26642,You get what you pay for.,26642,2
26642,I ordered 5 pairs and all were broken within 48 hours.,26642,2
26643,"cute but odd sizing, runs small had to return",26643,2
26644,Shirt does not fit at all like it shows in the photos.,26644,2
26644,Does not hang off shoulder and is more of a crew neck.,26644,2
26644,Very boxy.,26644,2
26645,Ordered XL but it was more like a Medium.,26645,2
26645,"As far as the style, nothing like the picture.",26645,2
26646,It's too big,26646,2
26647,I thought I got the right size but apparently not.,26647,2
26647,WAY too small.,26647,2
26647,"Order up a size (I'm a cross dresser, and this looked cute, but was way too small).",26647,2
26648,"Way too small, The quality is ok",26648,2
26649,These are just too thick to fit inside any of my shoes without creating the kind of friction that causes bunions.,26649,2
26649,I can't really use these.,26649,2
26650,Fell apart quickly.,26650,2
26651,I don't like this product because I thought it was a wireless charger but you have to have it plugged into the wall to charge your phone which make it not as convenient and the cord is not long enough,26651,2
26652,A lot of them are glued so tight to the package that when you try to peel it off the package they brake or the stones fly off,26652,2
26653,Thinner and shorter than I expected,26653,2
26654,"Pretty skirt,  but large would fit someone size 6.",26654,2
26654,I am a 12 or 14,26654,2
26655,Does not fit!,26655,2
26655,There is a reason why the picture shows the girls foot on her toes!,26655,2
26655,The second or third picture should show the jewelry flat footed when viewing the jewelry foot ware.,26655,2
26655,I did not get to upset because the price is inexpensive so who cares.,26655,2
26655,I also bought the exact one for a friend of mine and had it mailed to her through Amazon.,26655,2
26655,We are going to a yoga retreat together and I thought these would look cute.,26655,2
26655,"Unfortunately,  she said the same thing about hers!!",26655,2
26655,Did not look very good on her.,26655,2
26655,We just laughed because it is not a life changing moment.,26655,2
26655,I tossed mine in the trash and kept it moving.,26655,2
26656,Quality doesn't quite match what is picture and shirt definitely fits a little small.,26656,2
26657,I have a small head and this is so tight it give me a headache and eventually works it's way up my head and off.,26657,2
26657,Donation box.,26657,2
26657,Some kid will love it.,26657,2
26658,Broke after a couple weeks.,26658,2
26658,"Very cute, but not sturdy.",26658,2
26659,"See through fabric, very poor quality, took foooooooooorever to get.",26659,2
26659,I do not recommend.,26659,2
26660,Returned item.,26660,2
26660,Looks nothing like the photo.,26660,2
26660,Fits tight and has no shape,26660,2
26661,Meh.,26661,2
26661,"It does the job, but the quality is lacking.",26661,2
26662,Not form fitting.,26662,2
26662,Shoulders keep falling down.,26662,2
26663,Not the quality I expected.,26663,2
26663,I'm not sure if fake or not.,26663,2
26663,I've never had havainas before but before this pair I  owned a Payless plastic flip flop that lasted more than 6 years.,26663,2
26663,Someone borrowed and never returned them so I tried Payless again but they don't have them anymore.,26663,2
26663,I started looking on amazon and came across this flip flops.,26663,2
26663,The soles are fine but the strap between my toe cuts my skin.,26663,2
26663,I'm keeping them in hopes that they'll get better with everyday wear.,26663,2
26664,If you need any type of support in your breast area forget the swimsuit it's made for a teenager not a full figured woman the tides ripped away from the top the first day I wore it will not order another,26664,2
26665,"Honestly, I was really excited about this and was really disappointed.",26665,2
26665,"My mom passed away and I bought this for my 12 year old niece (who called her grandma ""mom"" as my mom had adopted her), who has been missing her a lot around the holidays.",26665,2
26665,"I noticed a deep scratch as soon as I opened it, but since it was delivered on the 23rd of December I figured I would still give it as a gift.",26665,2
26665,"Second, I was disappointed in the amount of space given for ashes.",26665,2
26665,It is only big enough for a few grains of ash.,26665,2
26665,(And the funnel kept plugging...not a fun experience).,26665,2
26665,"Finally, I ended up having to put a drop of super glue on the threads where the ashes go as it didn't seal tightly.",26665,2
26665,"It was very pretty and my niece needed it, but I really should have returned it.",26665,2
26666,This was given as a gift mailed out and was broken.,26666,2
26666,The stone was out my friend had to glue it in.,26666,2
26666,She does like it.,26666,2
26667,I'm a smaller person and from the other reviews I figured this would work.,26667,2
26667,Needless to say it was a bit big on me and I didn't like the fabric.,26667,2
26667,Not a comfy sweater...,26667,2
26668,Quality is there but it does not look like the model whatsoever.,26668,2
26668,I typically wear a size small/medium and I ordered a small.,26668,2
26668,This fits overly large in the width and length.,26668,2
26668,Not flattering- might try it with a belt.,26668,2
26669,Not for DD ladies,26669,2
26670,Item is not what picture show.,26670,2
26670,Picture show to have a belt type material around waste/under breast which it does not come with.,26670,2
26670,I wear a size 14 in jeans and ordered a size 3x in this item which I thought of course would be big..,26670,2
26670,This item for my 13 year old which wears a size 5/6 in jeans.,26670,2
26670,Was not happy with this item.,26670,2
26671,Nice quality.,26671,2
26671,But I can't wear them.,26671,2
26671,It isa painful experence.,26671,2
26672,Smaller than expected.,26672,2
26672,Not a one size fits all more like one size fits some.,26672,2
26673,The shirt says preshrunk but still shrinks quite a bit when washed the first time.,26673,2
26673,Definitely too small for me after washed.,26673,2
26673,Should have gotten a size bigger than that,26673,2
26674,Very short and small.,26674,2
26674,So disappointed,26674,2
26675,"First off, the front straps look like the last image (NOT like th first few images) and are a cheap looking material that's different from the rest of the bralette and makes it look really cheap.",26675,2
26675,I am a 32D and I got a medium.,26675,2
26675,The straps are kind of too long and it's a little loose.,26675,2
26675,The cups are pretty small too...,26675,2
26675,So it's pretty awkwardly fitting...,26675,2
26675,"But, I was able to get a full refund so im just going to alter it with some sewing to make it work.",26675,2
26676,It's big lol,26676,2
26677,I ordered XL.,26677,2
26677,"I wear XL in J.Crew, Lands End, Dockers, Eddie Bauer...",26677,2
26677,This is a Medium at best.,26677,2
26678,It's 100% pre- shrunk Cotton- it's not going to last long..,26678,2
26678,I wouldn't purchase again.,26678,2
26678,"The description online- 50 % cotton - 50% DryBlend polyester preshrunk

I could've spent the same amount and purchased clothing that would last longer than 2 months..",26678,2
26679,"They are very nice looking, but walking from one room to another they slipped off my feet.",26679,2
26679,So i can't wear them for the intended use i bought them for.,26679,2
26680,to small,26680,2
26681,"Although the image shows a case that can fit a good range of watch sizes, in real life is not that simple.",26681,2
26681,"My Tissot Seastar 1000 (not a huge watch -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tissot-Men-s-T0664271705700-Seastar-1000-Black-Chronograph-Dial-Watch/dp/B0051DA9HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tissot Men's T0664271705700 Seastar 1000 Black Chronograph Dial Watch</a>) couldn't fit the case at all.",26681,2
26681,It wouldn't close by any means because of the thickness of the case.,26681,2
26681,But if you only have small watches don't worry about it though.,26681,2
26682,The color is nice but the shoe is extra wide.,26682,2
26682,My daughter has wide fit and this shoe was waaay too wide on her.,26682,2
26683,"I buy small size, and it was to big and short",26683,2
26684,Didn't like the material or quality.,26684,2
26685,I did not like it so I returned.,26685,2
26685,I did not like the way it opened and it was hard to close in the case.,26685,2
26686,You have to be plus size for it to fit.,26686,2
26686,You can't just have a big bust.,26686,2
26686,Im a 38DDD and that what I ordered it rubs me just under my armpit.,26686,2
26687,These were too small so I returned them.,26687,2
26687,I would have continued to wear them if they had fit but the material is also harsh.,26687,2
26687,No comfort at all.,26687,2
26687,Maybe a bunch of washings with some fabric softener would help.,26687,2
26688,Head band detached from ribbon.,26688,2
26689,The bracelet's red color rubs off on my skin.,26689,2
26689,I have worn this twice and each time I had a red wrist.,26689,2
26689,The product comes from China so that makes me nervous about long term health effects.,26689,2
26690,"The pants are more cotton than spandex, like leggings and are see through.",26690,2
26691,The top is just a scarf that wraps around and is very see through.,26691,2
26691,I'm a 44G and wouldn't recommend this swimsuit.,26691,2
26691,My bust sits on its own but because they are larger I had less fabric to work with and had the to deal with rolling or completely coming off.,26691,2
26691,The top also was falling apart when it first arrived and had a lot of stray strings that needed to be cut.,26691,2
26692,too small,26692,2
26693,"I love the color and feel of this skirt, but I went with everyone's suggestions and i went bigger.",26693,2
26693,It was HUGE!,26693,2
26693,Falls right off.,26693,2
26693,"There is no size in the tag, so there is no way of telling which size I got sent.",26693,2
26693,I purchased this for a costume party and won't have time to return it.,26693,2
26693,I am going to spend more money altering than i did for the actual skirt.,26693,2
26694,Extremely thin leather.,26694,2
26694,Wore a hole on the clip on a month.,26694,2
26695,Too small for my a girl with meat on their bones,26695,2
26696,I ordered this thinking it was a necklace with an 18in chain.,26696,2
26696,It is not.,26696,2
26696,Although everything says its a necklace it is actually a bracelet.,26696,2
26696,"It's beautiful, but not what I wanted.",26696,2
26697,They're comfortable but I'm 5'4 180 pounds and my thighs have a muffin top and you can see my legs through them.,26697,2
26697,They also keep rolling down.,26697,2
26697,I don't think I'll be able to wear them.,26697,2
26698,WAY SMALL.,26698,2
26698,Good construction.,26698,2
26699,Broken after three weeks:(,26699,2
26700,"I wear a lot of suit and slim fit shirts, the concept of the footloop is amazing cause i don't feel it in my shoes, but the clips slip off numerous times which constantly makes me run to the restroom and fix myself.",26700,2
26700,Please make the clips to where they can hold on consistently.,26700,2
26701,I love the look of this dress...,26701,2
26701,In the picture.,26701,2
26701,It was exactly what I was looking for.,26701,2
26701,When it arrived I order my size and I was swimming in it...,26701,2
26701,The picture is not the same dress.,26701,2
26701,The model in the picture is super petite and I am too but this dress was way too much dress for my body it was well made and pretty but just would not fit at all ...,26701,2
26701,Very bulky,26701,2
26702,I didn't like the material at all.,26702,2
26702,Not as cute as the pic,26702,2
26703,Too small in the chest area,26703,2
26704,I didn't like the product.,26704,2
26704,"It was too small, had threads all over the place, and looked cheaply made.",26704,2
26705,The legs are plenty long but the hips are too tight and look stretched when worn.,26705,2
26705,The material is not quality.,26705,2
26705,I would not recommend these.,26705,2
26706,Its short.,26706,2
26706,"Im 5'6"" 164lbs.",26706,2
26706,I ordered M. Its way too short.,26706,2
26706,See through.,26706,2
26706,The color is bright.,26706,2
26707,I am disappointed on this tank blouse.,26707,2
26707,"On the model, it looks a lot more flattering compared to how it looks on me.",26707,2
26707,The front does not crease like how it is in the picture.,26707,2
26707,"Instead, it blows outward and makes you look either pregnant or full regardless if you have a flat stomach.",26707,2
26707,"Also,  in the picture, the lace on the back and sides are white but in person, they are similar to a cremy egg shell color.",26707,2
26708,Cheap and huge.,26708,2
26709,Looks very cheap and poorly made.,26709,2
26709,Way to small.,26709,2
26710,I got this wallet thinking that it was a normal size wallet and that it was a bit more well made than what it is.,26710,2
26710,Most men's jeans have rather large pockets and this thing is so huge that it takes up almost all the space or sticks out from the top.,26710,2
26710,it's a little bit awkward (especially since I put my wallet in the back pocket)  Not too comfortable when you sit on it Lol.,26710,2
26710,I also only had this product for about a month and a half now and the inside where your ID goes has already torn open.,26710,2
26710,I love the design on the front and that's why I bought it but unfortunately I think that it was a little over priced for what it is.,26710,2
26711,Not true to size,26711,2
26712,I bought it tried loving it but it just doesn't work too well.,26712,2
26712,It's very rough and shifts up after a long time wear.,26712,2
26712,It did absolutely nothing for me.,26712,2
26713,"Received this item in great condition, but the day my son opened it, it broke.",26713,2
26713,He dropped it on the floor and it just snapped.,26713,2
26713,It was wood flooring but not particularly hard.,26713,2
26713,"I think for $30, it should probably be able to handle being dropped one time.",26713,2
26714,size chart is not accurate.,26714,2
26715,The bottoms were too small.,26715,2
26715,The top was just right but bottoms didn't measure up,26715,2
26716,even though this product is listed it has 5 inch inseam it is way closer to 3 inches..,26716,2
26716,They really fit good other than the length.,26716,2
26717,The color is not the same as pictured.,26717,2
26717,And it fits a littlr tight,26717,2
26718,The dress looks amazing in the picture but I was very disappointed when it actually arrived.,26718,2
26718,The bottom part of the skirt was sewn on backwards and there was no hem to it so there were little strings hanging off.,26718,2
26718,"The price was great but because of that, there's no point sending it back to get a replacement.",26718,2
26718,Guess I'll just have to spend the extra money and take it to a seamstress.,26718,2
26719,I have returned this item.,26719,2
26719,I was not as described.,26719,2
26719,It was very thin and over all looked cheaply made.,26719,2
26720,Came scratched,26720,2
26721,It smelled horribly when it arrived so I washed on gentle and did not dry and the inside lining of the dress came apart and looked torn.,26721,2
26721,I guess you get what u pay for.,26721,2
26722,The shoes are cute but run small.,26722,2
26722,I am returing them.,26722,2
26723,"super cheaply made, fits very small, even when using the size guides, go up a size or 2 for sure.",26723,2
26724,Fake dress buyer beware,26724,2
26725,Didn't fit right -- had to give to Goodwill --,26725,2
26726,My friend can wear a kids L and a women's Xs-s and they fit her like it does in the picture.,26726,2
26726,Can't remember if I got large or XL I know I got the largest size I could and they were tight and short on me.,26726,2
26726,I normally wear shirts like this in a large and they are flowy,26726,2
26727,Looks bigger in the picture.,26727,2
26727,The words are so small you need a magnifying glass to read them.,26727,2
26728,Very thin fabric and made very cheaply.,26728,2
26728,Bought for my size small grown daughter and too small,26728,2
26729,"I have several pairs of volcom pants and shorts, so I ordered my usual size in volcom, which is 27.",26729,2
26729,"(For reference I am 5'3, 125 lbs, athletic build) They run big in the waist, but are very tight around my knees and calves.",26729,2
26729,I got them for a great deal and decided to give them a try.,26729,2
26729,I was able to take in the waist a bit and wore them once.,26729,2
26729,"They don't have very much stretch, so by the end of the day I felt like they were almost cutting off my circulation.",26729,2
26729,Disappointed about the weird fit bcz they are such a cute print.,26729,2
26730,Fit more like a bikini than a brief,26730,2
26731,One lens has a haze over it.,26731,2
26731,"I have tried everything to clean the lens, but it cannot be removed.",26731,2
26731,It appears to be a defect in the reflective portion of the lens.,26731,2
26731,Otherwise ok glasses for the price.,26731,2
26732,PLEASE BE AWARE!,26732,2
26732,This dress is totally different from what is shown in the picture.,26732,2
26732,The top fits fine but the bottom is straight and too tight.,26732,2
26732,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,26732,2
26732,!,26732,2
26733,Poor quality,26733,2
26734,WAYYYY TOO SMALL!!,26734,2
26734,I ordered an XL and got a shirt that will fit my niece that is turning 11 this year.,26734,2
26734,"I am giving this product 2 stars, because it is actually a cute shirt, but very cautious about ordering due to the size.",26734,2
26734,"It looks identical to the picture, but I am not exaggerating when I say that runs very small.",26734,2
26735,My kid is 17m old & im really having to stretch out to get on her head and she is small.,26735,2
26736,Low quality material and way smaller than advertised,26736,2
26737,"It's see- through in the water, Im short 5'3 and it digs in my inner thighs and the straps are digging in my shoulders a bit.",26737,2
26737,Got a large.,26737,2
26737,So size up a lot.,26737,2
26737,Would use it as a playsuit to lounge around the pool only.,26737,2
26738,It was made for a 5 year old girl not an adult small.,26738,2
26739,Bottoms run small even in the large,26739,2
26740,It was a little small and the buttons will not stay buttoned.,26740,2
26740,Very aggravating.,26740,2
26740,I stapled it where the buttons are lol,26740,2
26741,It's way smaller than it looks on the model.,26741,2
26741,Way shorter and doesn't really hang well because of the material.,26741,2
26741,I wish I had ordered a large even though I usually wear a s/m,26741,2
26742,Very cute and soft just runs small,26742,2
26743,"Liked the look of the top in the packaging, but a large/xlarge must be made for a 13 year old girl.",26743,2
26743,It was way too small.,26743,2
26744,For now I'm giving it a 2 star rating..,26744,2
26744,It's obviously very small and I'm a size 2...,26744,2
26744,I love everything about it except the size.,26744,2
26744,"I wasn't even able to pick a size and the girls in the picture look like they have nice boobies and are tall, but no they can't be because this product can fit a.",26744,2
26744,6 year old,26744,2
26745,I'm very disappointed in the quality of this item.,26745,2
26745,The only good thing to say is that each plug feels like its made out of stone and is the correct size.,26745,2
26745,Now the bad.,26745,2
26745,One of the white stone plugs I received had a chip/hole along the side that will cause it to become prone to collecting bacteria.,26745,2
26745,"Both of the brown stone plugs do not have the groove for the holding the o-ring in place, and the green plugs are much darker than what is shown in the pictures.",26745,2
26746,I ordered this piece because I love the idea of it...as well as the looks.,26746,2
26746,I did receive this bracelet on time.,26746,2
26746,Thank you for that.,26746,2
26746,"With that said...
As awesomely cool as this item does look, sadly it's not made of sound quality.",26746,2
26746,The bracelet is really flimsy; delicate like; not sturdy.,26746,2
26746,"3 days later, one of the wings fell completely off, right out of the ball.",26746,2
26746,I later found the wing on the floor.,26746,2
26746,I cannot reattach it because pieces are still missing.,26746,2
26746,And lastly...the clasp.,26746,2
26746,Ugh.,26746,2
26746,It was near impossible the get it to close.,26746,2
26746,~meh~,26746,2
26747,"Legs  way to wide not as,shown in catalog",26747,2
26748,"The strap is attached to only one side, so all of the weight in the bag puts extreme strain on the straps and forces the bag to be totally lop-sided and the straps are going to rip out at any moment.",26748,2
26749,it looks better in the picture,26749,2
26750,SSSOOOO Short!!!!,26750,2
26750,Barely covers my business.,26750,2
26750,"I'm 5'7""",26750,2
26751,This shirt smelled like a sweat shop and had a stain on the pocket upon arrival.,26751,2
26752,way too small and weird shape and cheap material.,26752,2
26752,pretty color though,26752,2
26753,Cute wallet but you get what you pay for with quality wise.,26753,2
26753,Cheaply made and doesn't close once there are a couple cards and some money in it (magnet is weak).,26753,2
26753,Works for if you want a small clutch type wallet with a couple little things in it for a night out.,26753,2
26754,"sticks well, but is too small.",26754,2
26755,Not so much worthy this prize,26755,2
26756,The sleeves are too short and its too snug to be baggy.,26756,2
26757,I ordered this based off of reviews and I was disappointed.,26757,2
26757,"As many stated, it does run somewhat large, but for me, it was extremely baggy in the bust area.",26757,2
26757,"I thought I would like the silver buttons down the side, but something just wasn't vibing right with the whole look of the top.",26757,2
26757,I'm returning it.,26757,2
26758,"If you order this, order 1 size bigger.",26758,2
26758,They are small,26758,2
26759,These earrings are really pretty and seem like good quality so I really wish I could wear them.,26759,2
26759,"However, like the other reviews stated the bars are way too short and barely fit through.",26759,2
26759,"The ball is also ridiculously hard to twist on and impossible to do without the help of someone else, so I basically can't wear these.",26759,2
26760,Would have needed Xlarge  but they didn't have it.,26760,2
26760,Not worth postage to return.,26760,2
26760,I am size 14 blouse and 16 pants and is goes over hips.,26760,2
26760,Nice and prob cool for.,26760,2
26760,summer.,26760,2
26760,Will need strapless bra because fabric is not thick unless you are very small breasted.,26760,2
26760,Will give it as present to thinner friend.,26760,2
26760,PS.,26760,2
26760,Will give better review if you email me a return postage label.,26760,2
26761,black part was too short,26761,2
26762,Too see through,26762,2
26763,"In person, it looks much less glamorous",26763,2
26764,ITS OKAY,26764,2
26765,"Highly anticipated, but unfortunately disappointed.",26765,2
26765,"These hearts looked so cute, I really had high hopes from the reviews.",26765,2
26765,"Unfortunately, the 00 gauges arrived and we're not only too small in circumference but the length was too long as well.",26765,2
26765,The hearts made my ear lobes sit out.,26765,2
26765,Maybe I need to go up a size.,26765,2
26765,But be warned these plugs run small.,26765,2
26766,"It's cute, but the XXL definitely runs small.",26766,2
26767,It was a little big.,26767,2
26767,"The straps would consistently fall down my arms, but it was really cute.",26767,2
26768,"The metal frame is really good quality, but the print is just a sticker.",26768,2
26768,My sticker had so many bubbles that it looked like a child slapped a sticker on the frame.,26768,2
26769,"Too tight, over priced for the quality.",26769,2
26769,The color is nice but the material seems like a two dollar mask.,26769,2
26770,I've owned these several weeks.,26770,2
26770,Worn about 4 times and the lens keeps popping out.,26770,2
26770,So frustrating.,26770,2
26770,When the lens cooperates: they are very helpful when need sunglasses as well as my prescription glasses.,26770,2
26770,Yes your family will call you an old lady; but being able to see trumps that for me.,26770,2
26771,"The glasses are really cute, but for some reason it was folding inward when i tried it on.",26771,2
26772,"It was entirely too small, and also way too short.",26772,2
26772,"Also, the pattern on the front stops at the side seams.",26772,2
26772,The back of the skirt is solid maroon.,26772,2
26773,These were huge on my 2 year old and kept falling off.,26773,2
26774,"(multi-colored beaded cuff)
As in my previous review of this product, in different colors, I indicated that I have a problem with each of three items I purchased from this seller, and can't begin to say they were in the least cooperative, pleasant or helpful about it.",26774,2
26774,"This bracelet is pretty, but quite 'unfinished'.",26774,2
26774,"It is more interesting, it's more advanced, has a nicely 'finished' border, which indicated and follows a 'finished' braided style, which is quite nice.",26774,2
26774,"I think they can do better by virtue of this example of their abilities, so I hope they can learn to expand upon this more advanced design.",26774,2
26774,"I find that there are still entirely too many open ends, where the wires aren't hooked closely enough, they still 'catch' on absolutely everything, and will ruin clothing of any type, irreparably.",26774,2
26774,"It's too bad, I think with a little more care and perhaps more time, these bracelets, or 'cuffs',show promise.",26774,2
26774,"Again, the attitude of the seller is another issue, so I'll let other customers reactions help to influence reactions to that, but good luck, nonetheless.",26774,2
26774,suzette,26774,2
26775,These were very large and looked as if they belonged to a Halloween costume.,26775,2
26776,Honestly just be careful.,26776,2
26776,Doesn't look like the picture.,26776,2
26776,Very small and very see through!,26776,2
26776,I ordered an 8 (large) and it looks like a small.,26776,2
26776,Seriously just be careful and unless you're tiny don't get it.,26776,2
26776,Also sleeves are just past the shoulders.,26776,2
26776,"So much wrong with it, will not be buying again.",26776,2
26776,Cheap.,26776,2
26777,"it was too small,  and it was of extremely poor quality.",26777,2
26777,You get what you pay for.,26777,2
26777,Do not purchase this.,26777,2
26777,It's not worth the plastic it's wrapped in.,26777,2
26778,"Cute, but doesn't fit my ear",26778,2
26779,Very excited to try on the Xl to have it fit perfectly.,26779,2
26779,Unfortunately when I washed it it shrunk.,26779,2
26779,A lot.,26779,2
26779,And yes I read the instructions... a l o t,26779,2
26780,The product has messed up stitching and the cross is about to fall off,26780,2

26785,"Ordered 2xl, not true too size from vendor.",26785,2
26786,"The product I purchased was for my wife, when they came it looks like men's masculine dark rimmed glasses, and do not look anything like the picture online.",26786,2
26786,"Woman's glasses should look feminine, not like Buddy Holly glasses.",26786,2
26787,"A little disappointed, but I didn't pay much.",26787,2
26787,I bought it for laptop work bag and its straps are not a good for carrying a laptop.,26787,2
26787,It didn't feel sturdy.,26787,2
26788,Fits smaller than normal size.,26788,2

26791,I love the look and convenience of this wallet.,26791,2
26791,I am disappointed in the quality.,26791,2
26791,The snap that holds the cardholder part closed is hard to unsnap looks like it is going to break at any time I unsnap it.,26791,2
26791,Hope it doesn't break because I really do like the wallet.,26791,2
26792,never wore it.look cheap,26792,2
26793,"Although this ring is beautiful, and looked super cute on!",26793,2
26793,I could not wear it!,26793,2
26793,I wore it for 2 days and I had small cuts around my belly button from each point on the bow.,26793,2
26793,I think the bar was too short for my piercing.,26793,2
26793,I was disappointed because it is so adorable.,26793,2
26794,the string is thin rubber and has ripped a couple weeks after I bought it.,26794,2
26794,still have the stones though :),26794,2

26798,It is pretty thick material also.,26798,2

26799,"The fit was as expected (read the reviews and bought a size up, it wasn't too wide and a perfect length).",26799,2
26799,I returned it solely for the fact the material is so thin.,26799,2
26800,The shirt is extremely wide and after normal wear and two washings the collar began to come unstitched.,26800,2
26800,The shirt is not well made.,26800,2

26806,It turned my finger green the day after.,26806,2
26807,Much Much too small.,26807,2
26807,I followed the sizing chart - I typically wear a medium or a large so I ordered an XL just to be sure.,26807,2
26807,The head hole is so small I couldn't even get my normal-sized head through it!,26807,2
26807,"It is indeed a beautiful shirt, though.",26807,2
26807,"If you wear a small or an xs, this will be a good purchase for you.",26807,2
26807,The fabric is very sheer but well printed.,26807,2
26807,I'm sad that it didn't work out.,26807,2
26807,"I'm keeping the shirt around, though, because I loved the pattern so much.",26807,2
26807,Maybe I can cut it up and use it in a craft or for a pillow one day.,26807,2
26807,It is very pretty.,26807,2
26808,"Ordered 006, the entirely leather jacket, was looking forward to replacing my old one which broke.",26808,2
26808,"I even double checked in my order history, and indeed I had ordered 006.",26808,2
26808,"However, I received 005, the leather jacket with CLOTH ARMS AND CLOTH BACK, with ostentatious zippers in the front side as well, which is completely different from what I wanted.",26808,2
26808,"Now I have to return it, and I'd like to send it in for a replacement rather than simply returning it, but then I'd risk simply getting sent the wrong order again.... so I will have to find a leather jacket somewhere else.",26808,2
26808,"Based on some reviews, it seems like other people had this problem as well.",26808,2
26808,"For others looking at this jacket, be aware that they seem to mix up the black leather jacket orders somewhat often.",26808,2
26808,"I'm going to try ordering 006 again, the entirely leather one.",26808,2
26808,Will update after that goes through to see if I get the right one this time.,26808,2
26809,Size was not descriptive and was way too small.,26809,2
26810,"terrible smell, I cant wear it...",26810,2
26811,These dresses are all made in China and are tiny... Their size chart is a size or two smaller than US sizes.,26811,2

26814,Small and terrible material,26814,2
26815,This purse literally stinks.,26815,2
26815,Also the leather gle that was used is not holding.,26815,2
26815,The reviews on this item must have been plants because no sane person would want this purse once it was recieved.,26815,2
26815,I even put heavy duty charcoal Oder eaters in the purse to help remove the stench.,26815,2
26815,To no avail.,26815,2
26815,It's on it's way back.,26815,2
26816,I weigh 158.,26816,2

26817,The breast area is loose and around the pelvis area is big.,26817,2
26817,Fit my legs just fine.,26817,2
26817,"But I'm 5'0, 100lbs, (with not much of a shape.",26817,2
26817,So it didn't not fit my small frame.,26817,2
26817,"So ladies if your petite, don't get this.",26817,2
26817,You definitely need more boobs and ta tahs for this outfit.,26817,2
26817,It would be very cute but just not for me.,26817,2
26817,I'll be sending it back.,26817,2
26817,Oh P.S.,26817,2
26817,"It's see thru and a silky, shiny material.",26817,2
26818,This suit is so wrong in so many ways.,26818,2
26818,"I am 5'8"", not short by any means, and this thing is way too long.",26818,2
26818,"The butt area is too baggy (and I have hips for days), and the bra... oh, God.",26818,2
26818,The bra.,26818,2
26818,"I am a D cup and the bra of this suit is far, far too small.",26818,2
26818,"Half my boob hangs out the bottom, the top part of my boob is squeezed out like play-doh, the shape of the bra is like a road cone, and it's stiff like cardboard.",26818,2
26818,Awful.,26818,2
26818,Just awful.,26818,2
26818,There are 2 redeeming qualities that warrant my 2 star review: the red color is gorgeous and the stomach section with the wrinkles is very becoming.,26818,2
26818,I would not buy this suit again.,26818,2
26819,very frumpy,26819,2
26820,I admittedly need to shed a few pounds.,26820,2
26820,I'd need to lose about 70 for these to fit right.,26820,2
26820,"If you're 140 lbs with no body fat, give them a try.",26820,2
26820,"If you're not, you're not going to like the result (no one else in sight of you will, either).",26820,2
26821,Don't get me wrong: I can tell the difference between these boxers and my Fruit of the Loom.,26821,2
26821,These boxers are clearly higher quality.,26821,2
26821,So why do I prefer wearing my cheaper boxers?,26821,2
26821,The soft material on this underwear rides up very easily.,26821,2
26821,"Additionally, the fabric walls that hold thine marbles in only worsen the condition they are meant to resolve.",26821,2
26821,"Pardon my crudity, but two wet wells of fabric rubbing against you is much worse than skin on skin, especially since the mesh walls make you sweat more.",26821,2
26821,"If they didn't ride up I'd wear them more, but after a while it feels like my legs will loose circulation.",26821,2
26821,And I'm not overweight.,26821,2
26822,"Good thing I opened it before I gave it as a gift, very pretty but chain was broken.",26822,2
26822,Returning.,26822,2
26823,I bought the smallest one since I am not a big guy (5'10'' - 155lbs).,26823,2
26823,It was way too large and uncomfortable to use.,26823,2
26824,I expected this vintage gown will be great as the photo here.,26824,2
26824,"Unfortunately, the quality of the zipper really bad.",26824,2
26824,"The blue lace layer also seems like something not done yet, it's not artistic.",26824,2
26825,Not comfortable.,26825,2
26825,Really constricting.,26825,2
26826,"Poorly made,  long threads hanging all over the blouse.",26826,2
26827,Too large,26827,2
26828,"Just pretty, but tottaly see through, I can easily see my underwear under the pants.",26828,2
26828,"I'm 130 lbs, 5'5 and size 7 was big.",26828,2
26828,"My color pants is pink, maybe the black one work better, I will try one in black.",26828,2
26829,On the small side and the color is much darker than shown.,26829,2
26830,"It is very small, barely any stretch to it.",26830,2
26830,Other than that it is like the description and is how it looks in the pictures.,26830,2
26831,I ordered a small and several people my size could get in it at one time.,26831,2
26831,"I like the colors, but it is very cheaply made.",26831,2
26831,"But when you consider how inexpensive it is, that's to be expected.",26831,2
26832,So darn small.,26832,2
26832,Def size up a couple sizes.,26832,2
26832,SIDENOTE: I was not given a discount or free product.,26832,2
26832,This review is my unbiased opinion.,26832,2
26833,Good for a swimsuit cover but not for going out,26833,2
26834,O.k.,26834,2
26835,I had to go back and check the write-up to be sure it said women's.,26835,2
26835,This cap is small.,26835,2
26836,get what you pay for,26836,2
26837,When the item arrived it was not the color shown.,26837,2
26837,"It is, in fact, much lighter almost silver.",26837,2
26837,The clicker is very difficult and moves in other directions not just up and down into the slot.,26837,2
26837,"Still a beautiful septum ring, however.",26837,2
26837,Happy with much purchase overall but the picture is misleading.,26837,2
26838,Runs extremely small,26838,2
26839,Somewhat to small,26839,2
26840,by the picture I thought they were fold down waist pants.,26840,2
26840,"They have a very wide, tight fitting elastic in the waist.",26840,2
26840,"I suffer from sciatica, I can't have any kind of tight elastic around my waist or hips.",26840,2
26840,So I am sending them back.,26840,2
26840,I really liked them other than that.,26840,2
26840,"the size was great I wear a size 12 and the large fit great, length was good, I am 5'9 and it was perfect length.",26840,2
26840,"the material was nice, thick and soft.",26840,2
26841,"I ordered a size large based on the other reviews (for reference, I'm 115lbs and 5'2) and the large was still a little too short in the torso area but it is stretchy.",26841,2
26841,"The material is EXTREMELY thin but I figured since I ordered this swimsuit in black, it should do an okay job at concealing - nope.",26841,2
26841,"It is so thin that when stretched, it is almost translucent in the light.",26841,2
26841,"The pictures also make it seem that the swimsuit's straps are more low-cut, but the suit itself resembles more of a bodysuit as it has a more scoop-neck appearance and a high back.",26841,2
26841,I guess I can't complain since it was only ~$6 but I'm not sure I'll even feel comfortable wearing this in public.,26841,2
26842,"I like the design, but the hat is flimsy and flat when you wear it.",26842,2
26842,Not a good look in my opinion.,26842,2
26842,I don't recommend it.,26842,2
26843,Keep a lint roller nearby!,26843,2
26843,Pink fuzz EVERYWHERE!,26843,2
26843,Even after washing,26843,2
26844,I'm a bigger person and ordered a xxxl but this would not even fit a 11 year old child.,26844,2
26844,I am upset because the material is super cool (as in stretchy and a rubbery texture).,26844,2
26844,Sell it as a kids shirt or a very petite female adult.,26844,2
26845,"I'm pretty disappointed in this, I saw the reviews that people used this as a Stitch costume but it looks nothing like Stitch.",26845,2
26845,It's a very baby blue in color with magenta ears.,26845,2
26845,The ears are really short.,26845,2
26845,It's just not cosmetically what I was hoping for.,26845,2
26846,"The shoes fit and look just fine but, they have a very strong and overwhelming odor of what I can only guess is glue and other petroleum products...NOT GOOD!",26846,2
26847,Ordered large women's and seems to be a junior or kids size.,26847,2
26847,Returning and looking for another brand.,26847,2
26848,Love the shirt but it doesn't fit like an extra large,26848,2
26849,Super cute colors/patterns...but the fit was a full size too small.,26849,2
26849,"I've bought this brand/style for years, in the same size...and when you hold an old pair up to the new, there is a significant difference in size.",26849,2
26849,Really disappointed.,26849,2
26850,pretty noticeable but it works for what it is.,26850,2
26850,too short and can fall out easy,26850,2
26851,Ordered an XL.,26851,2
26851,Way too big.,26851,2
26852,This brand of dress fits too small as far as I am concerned.,26852,2
26852,Very tight around arms and top.,26852,2
26852,"Padded bust cups were in the wrong place, more in the center of the front, and would not fit naturally.",26852,2
26852,This dress must be meant or sized for Juniors NOT Misses.,26852,2
26852,"The quality of the fabric, lace and stitching is quite nice, but not the sizing.",26852,2
26852,Waist down fit okay; waist up...way too small.,26852,2
26852,I normally wear size 10 or 12 dress and 36B bra.,26852,2
26852,This size 12 dress fit very awkwardly and small.,26852,2
26852,It would be a very cute dress for the right person with the right size.,26852,2
26853,It says it is red but it is quite hot pink.,26853,2
26854,It does not look like in the picture at all.,26854,2
26855,It was way too small and I didn't have time to reorder it for the event I was attending.,26855,2
26855,It was a very pretty dress though.,26855,2
26856,Way big it hardly stays on my shoulders,26856,2
26857,"Little too big, upset i can't trade them until Aug 16th & its july 17 today.",26857,2
26857,Going to buy the smaller size an return the larger size 30 back in a month when i can get my money back.,26857,2
26857,"Run a little big, but great fabric",26857,2
26858,"In a different color and with short sleeves, this would be good as beach, casual wear.",26858,2
26858,Wouldn't recommend for professional setting.,26858,2
26858,"Probably best for a very short, flat chested person.",26858,2
26858,"CONS:
-MATERIAL - thin material, slightly sheer.",26858,2
26858,Look and feels cheap.,26858,2
26858,Thinner than the casual ts I got from T a r get.,26858,2
26858,"-SIZING - Length  is short even for my height 5'1"".",26858,2
26858,Not suitable for anyone with a bust.,26858,2
26858,It seems like there isn't enough fabric for full coverage for at least a C cup.,26858,2
26858,"The gathered part beneath the bust sits ON the bust and if it's pulled down to be below it, it's a wench look with boobs overflowing.",26858,2
26858,"-DESIGN - the square neckline is really deep and wide, showing boob top and bra strap.",26858,2
26858,Shows way too much skin to be appropriate for work setting imo.,26858,2
26859,Very unsatisfied one of the pearls were missing when I received the earrings and I paid Extra money for two day shipping had to find super glue to fix the missing pearl and it messed up the finish on two other pearls on the earring very disappointed!!!,26859,2
26859,!,26859,2
26860,it is not fit my feet.,26860,2
26861,"Very cute but poorly made, broke within one week.",26861,2
26862,This is really cheap looking in person.,26862,2
26862,It didn't cost much though.,26862,2
26862,So I suppose that's to be expected.,26862,2
26863,I ordered a large and it fit snug so I ordered an XLARGE and fit SMALLER than the Large .,26863,2
26863,Seller offered 50% refund and keep the return.,26863,2
26863,Not sized properly.,26863,2
26863,I want a refund for what I paid for the vest I'm returning.,26863,2

26866,The post was too short.,26866,2
26867,Very hard to get into and does not fit as stated.,26867,2
26867,I am an average sized woman and I could not fit it designed more for the petite approx size 4.,26867,2
26868,The face was too large and metal left fingerprints just by lightly handling.,26868,2
26868,This product was returned.,26868,2
26869,"fit way tight compared to the others, I would order a larger size",26869,2
26870,Decent quality for price,26870,2
26871,Too small/short etc.,26871,2
26871,Gave it to my neighbor,26871,2
26872,Ran really really small.,26872,2
26872,Order one or two sizes up and should be ok.,26872,2
26873,"It was ok, It came with a hole in it, I had to stitch it up.... that was disappointing.",26873,2
26873,The small was a bit big for me,26873,2
26874,Dress was beautiful but I ordered a size bigger than measurement and when I received it it was to small by at least one size maybe two,26874,2
26875,these look great and were a wonderful price but the zipper broke within hours on every single one.,26875,2
26876,Wasn't happy,26876,2
26877,the shirt is fine but about two sizes too small.,26877,2
26877,I should have read the review better,26877,2
26878,It's ok.,26878,2
26878,IT IS ONE EARRING.,26878,2
26878,Not earring(S).,26878,2
26878,"for one earring it's a pricey, but looks good.",26878,2
26879,"I like the long wrists and the snug knit, but I am not convinced they are anything other than acrylic.",26879,2
26879,"They are not particularly warm, and lack the legal import fabric content tag required by the FTC.",26879,2
26879,I did the natural fiber content burn test on part of a seam -- real animal fiber will smell like burning hair and turn to powder ash.,26879,2
26879,Synthetics will melt and smell chemical.,26879,2
26879,This melted.,26879,2
26879,"At most, they are a very very very low percentage of alpaca blended with acrylic to justify calling it alpaca.",26879,2
26879,Don't expect too much.,26879,2
26880,Overpriced.,26880,2
26880,For as much as I paid for these I expected better.,26880,2
26880,These still ride up my leg and bunch up.,26880,2
26881,"Loved the shirt however it did not wash well, I only got two wears out of it before it pulled up and looked worn out",26881,2
26882,"Ordered a large and had to end up giving it to my sister who I normally share clothes with, hate to see what anything less than a large looks and fits like!!!",26882,2
26882,"At least it was really cute on her and my money wasn't waisted, just hate u have to hurry up and try and find another swimsuit for vacation.",26882,2
26883,Is missing one of the bra pads!,26883,2
26884,Cute suit.,26884,2
26884,Is baby blue and white good material an quality unfortunately it runs very small.,26884,2
26884,I'm usually a size M I ordered XL and still didn't fit the bra part is very small,26884,2
26885,These  sunglasses are sooooo cute!,26885,2
26885,I absolutely love them.,26885,2
26885,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my pair came defective.,26885,2
26885,The left leg is really tight and it makes it so hard to close them that they've even ended up bent due how difficult it is to close them.,26885,2
26885,Now they don't look as good due to the fact that they're bent because they came too tight from the manufacturer,26885,2
26886,The product does not look like the picture of your website.,26886,2
26886,The color is different.,26886,2
26886,I attach a photo.,26886,2
26887,Awkwardly shaped and unflattering.,26887,2
26887,Okay to lounge around the house alone,26887,2
26888,Daughter never wore.,26888,2
26888,Sizing way too small,26888,2
26889,"The balls at the ends are in good shape and I can use them with my other jewelry, but the plastic bar was very rough and very uncomfortable.",26889,2
26889,"It wasn't properly smoothed down, and I worry about how porous and bacteria retaining the material is.",26889,2
26890,ordered XXlarge couldn't get it past my shoulders and I usually wear a 14 So disappointed,26890,2
26891,"Low quality, nothing like the photo.",26891,2
26892,I bought these to bring with us to Disney so the kids could wear them on the plane ride there and when we were in the parks the first couple days before we got around to buying the Disney ears.,26892,2
26892,They held up through the trip and probably only got worn for about half the week.,26892,2
26892,As I pulled them out of the suitcase at the end of the week the ears fell off the headbands.,26892,2
26892,They served the use for us I guess because the kids did end up buying Disney ears to wear instead of these but I do wish they had lasted longer.,26892,2
26893,This is not a dress its an thin shirt.,26893,2
26893,Would not recommend this as a dress at all.,26893,2
26894,The arms are tight.,26894,2
26895,You definitely need a large amount of junk in the trunk to pull this off.,26895,2
26895,Color was not as bright and popping as on the web; it was more of a dull purple.,26895,2
26895,More like it had been washed several times first?,26895,2
26895,Sent mine back,26895,2
26896,Very cute but they lens are flat,26896,2
26897,Plaid&Plain came through for me.,26897,2
26897,"Since the item was too small, we came to an understanding that they maid good on the mistake.",26897,2
26898,very nice but 4 size to small.,26898,2
26899,I am a bit disappointed as to how small they are.,26899,2
26899,They are hard to put on and they only cover a very small area.,26899,2
26899,Don't think I am going to use :(,26899,2
26900,Was not good fabric,26900,2
26901,The material is not as I expected.,26901,2
26901,Looks cheap.,26901,2
26902,"If I turn them inside out, that reduces the abrasion of the meatus, but I haven't figured out how to reduce the rope burns between the scrotum and thigh.",26902,2
26902,"Probably best worn for showing off to someone who will be taking them off, soon.",26902,2
26903,It is a bit fragile.,26903,2
26903,Looks like fashion jewelry and not silver.,26903,2
26903,I like silver so I will wear it.,26903,2
26904,it looks like a night gown.never wore it out.,26904,2
26905,The backs were not a suitable fit.,26905,2
26905,I've already lost an earring and a back because they fell off.,26905,2
26905,Very frustrating!,26905,2
26906,Very thin material and sizes run small.,26906,2
26907,But sexy if it fits,26907,2
26908,very awkward fit on the arms.,26908,2
26908,if you have long arms this is probably good,26908,2
26909,"Long in the front and short in the back, odd fit.",26909,2
26910,Very Sheer and very small.,26910,2
26910,I normally wear a XL  because I like shirts to fit a little big.,26910,2
26910,I ordered a XXL and my boobs are totally smushed.,26910,2
26910,Too bad because it would have been a cute shirt.,26910,2
26911,The shirt is obviously cheaply made.. very thin material and the graphic cracked the first time I wore it..,26911,2
26912,"Ugh...ugly dress on, cheap thin polyester, sewn weird...not flattering at all.",26912,2
26912,Would've sent back but I accidentally threw the packaging away.,26912,2
26912,Oh well.,26912,2
26913,Had to order next size up.,26913,2
26914,did not look as it does in the picture and they are more like tights rather then leggings super see-through,26914,2
26915,tarnished already,26915,2
26916,"Bought for my daughter that is 5'1"".",26916,2
26916,This dress is more like a long shirt.,26916,2
26916,It barely covers her underwear in the front!,26916,2
26916,Not to mention is completely see through.,26916,2
26916,Nowhere near the quality I had expected.,26916,2
26916,Sending back for a refund.,26916,2
26917,Not necessary,26917,2
26918,The shirt is two sizes too small and is a weird boxy cut.,26918,2
26919,The fabric is incredibly thin and can easily be seen through.,26919,2
26920,Cheap material!,26920,2
26920,Looks cheap too.,26920,2
26921,"I really wanted to keep this handbag as it is soft, cute and loved the color.",26921,2
26921,"The craftsmanship is not all there and probably could've gotten past that as I really liked the style and feel of handbag, but I am returning it because it had some adhesive/glue that couldn't be cleaned off.",26921,2
26921,"Bought it as a Flash Deal for $24 so really wasn't expecting top notch quality, but the adhesive did show.",26921,2
26922,The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames.,26922,2
26922,"Several years ago, I ordered a 6 pack from the same seller.",26922,2
26922,The vertical measurement of those lenses was much narrower.,26922,2

26922,The lenses are way to big for reading glasses.,26922,2
26923,Didn't fit me well and fabric was hard to get wrinkles out,26923,2
26924,Colors faded significantly after a single wash.,26924,2
26925,Not as shown as on the picture but it did come with a small box one thing I don't like is that I did not get any lip rings that are hooks but other then that its okay,26925,2
26926,"A case of ""You get what you pay for""",26926,2
26927,The design in the back required a much bigger size than what I got.,26927,2
26927,"The way the button should lay to look good, makes the cut way too small.",26927,2
26928,"It might be a nice jacket, but where do they get these sizes?",26928,2
26928,"The one I ordered, an XXXL, was at least two sizes too small.",26928,2
26928,"Really, it would have been a tight fit for someone who wears an large, much less anyone bigger.",26928,2
26929,This was by far not what I expected.,26929,2
26929,Very poor quality of material.,26929,2
26929,Extremely thin and transparent.,26929,2
26929,If it were larger I'd wear it to bed & consider it a night shirt.,26929,2
26929,The two stars are because it looks just like the picture.,26929,2
26930,"Fit is fine for trunk of body, but shoulders are too wide.",26930,2
26931,This didn't look at all like the picture.,26931,2
26931,"It was HUGE, like a dress, and not fitted.",26931,2

26936,The ring is made well.,26936,2
26936,The stones are as expected for the price.,26936,2
26937,I like it,26937,2
26938,I was disappointed in the quality of the beads.,26938,2
26938,I could have purchased some just like them for $1 at the Dollar Tree,26938,2
26939,Disappointed for what it is.,26939,2
26939,Came with a small hole/tear in the strap.,26939,2
26940,UGLY,26940,2
26941,This shirt was billed as a size 14 but it was more like a size 10.,26941,2
26941,The design is cute and my granddaughter wanted it.,26941,2
26941,"So we wash on gentle cycle cold, take out of washer and stretch the shirt as much as possible, from top to bottom and side to side.",26941,2
26941,"Then air dry, will probably get 6 - 8 weeks wear out of this shirt.",26941,2
26941,"Unless your buying for a petite girl, don't bother.",26941,2
26942,"This not maternity friendly, at least not in the apricot color.",26942,2
26942,Very thin material and very see through.,26942,2
26943,Ran very small,26943,2
26944,Product was not very good.,26944,2
26944,"My wife kept it ,but it would not fit me .",26944,2
26944,Product is from China.,26944,2
26944,Quality was normal running rain weight.,26944,2
26944,Would NOT recommend.,26944,2
26945,"Bought it for my septum, it was much larger than I expected, not wearable because of how ridiculous it looked.",26945,2
26946,The bottom was way too small.,26946,2
26946,The top is so stiff that it gaps open when you lean down.,26946,2
26946,It was not comfortable to wear all day.,26946,2
26947,"Look good, but size is way smaller than average.",26947,2
26947,Leading to a see through appearance.,26947,2
26948,not good quality of the product,26948,2
26949,Very cute but it's way too small !,26949,2
26949,Clothes from chine r made too small!,26949,2
26950,"I am very hungry because the shiping is very very expensive, ten twice more that the price",26950,2
26951,Top fit as expected.,26951,2
26951,Bottom too small.,26951,2
26952,It was VERY flimsy.,26952,2
26952,Not well made at all.,26952,2
26952,It just looks like 1 necklace when you put it on.,26952,2
26953,"I love the design, I love the quality, the material feels great, but, when I tried it on, the bottom is a little tight, just a little and the top was lose.",26953,2
26953,"I ordered the size xs it says xs on the tags of the two piece, but the top feels like a medium.",26953,2
26954,Not water proof or even water resistant.,26954,2
26954,Very small  Bel row and buckle are cheap.,26954,2
26955,Seemed like a good quality product but the fit looked horrible on me.,26955,2
26955,It looked like I was wearing a sparkly diaper.,26955,2
26956,it very beautifal but fit too small.,26956,2
26957,I wanted this to be perfect - it was for my daughter's Elsa costume.,26957,2
26957,It would have been great - but it was just poorly put together.,26957,2
26957,"The actual crown piece looked nice, but it was mounted off-center on the tiara, so it looked strange on her head.",26957,2
26957,We had to return it.,26957,2
26958,I ordered this time in the size for only to find out I couldn't get it over my head.,26958,2
26958,"So then I ordered it in the size 8 thinking if we can fit more comfortably, but it was still too small.",26958,2
26958,I give up as there is no happy medium in ordering the right size for this product,26958,2
26959,Definitely bigger than expected.,26959,2
26959,The color is a really dark purple.,26959,2

26961,The lenses are tiny too.,26961,2
26961,Wish it was bigger.,26961,2
26962,"Great price, but run small.",26962,2
26962,Also fabric is different then the genie bras I've bought before.,26962,2
26962,"My genie bras I do have have  ""genie bras"" on the tag, these do not.",26962,2
26962,"Almost makes me wonder if they really are ""genie bras"" or knock off.",26962,2
26963,"The dress is pretty, but it is about 10 inches too long!!",26963,2
26963,!,26963,2
26964,Way too small ordered 2 sizes bigger and it wasn't enough.,26964,2
26964,I'll have to loose weight in order to fit in this to loose weight.,26964,2
26965,"Comical looking, so big.",26965,2
26965,Ok to watch tv.,26965,2
26965,Really not soft enough to sleep in.,26965,2
26965,Probably should have returned.,26965,2
26966,It has a weird coating that can be chopped off.,26966,2
26967,Not exactly as shown in picture.,26967,2
26968,One bracelet broke the first day I wore it.,26968,2

26969,"I usually used L, and obviously I bought L, It was Ok my legs but does not in my hips.",26969,2
26969,It broke at the seams the first day I used it.,26969,2
26970,"So, I'm posting this through my husband's account, because this is the account I ordered through.",26970,2
26970,"I didn't expect to much for the price and the ""one size fits most"" however I didn't expect it to be false advertising.",26970,2
26970,On the model it shows a cute laced plunged neckline romper.,26970,2
26970,What I received is a black G-string teddy with fringe.,26970,2
26970,"I can't really give a decent description on this product, because I didn't receive it.",26970,2
26970,I will say though beware of this happening to you and well you get what you pay for.,26970,2
26971,Very hot and the size is off,26971,2
26972,Thin and flimsy.,26972,2
26972,They bunch up and the legs and waist band roll.,26972,2
26973,"I bought these socks for myself and they were great, but then I bought them for my boyfriend and they didn't fit him at all.",26973,2
26973,Which really disappointed me because they were a Christmas gift and they were basically a waste of money.,26973,2
26973,"They shouldn't say ""one size fits all"" if they don't really fit all sizes.",26973,2
26974,This bathing suit is so cute unfortunately I had to return it because it was too big.,26974,2
26974,Do not size up,26974,2
26975,"It's a regular t-shirt, the collar and sleves look different in the picture!",26975,2
26976,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,26976,2
26976,"Too big , different fit !",26976,2
26977,The xl dress will fit a medium so I gave it to my sister,26977,2
26978,It's very poorly made / cheap for the $36 I paid for it.,26978,2
26978,I bought it as a gift and was bummed out that it was such low quality.,26978,2
26978,"In addition it arrived smelling strongly of cigarettes, so I had to wash it before even giving it to my friend!",26978,2
26978,Crappy.,26978,2
26979,Way too big sent back,26979,2
26980,It has weird markings on it that make it look dirty but it's part of the snow.,26980,2
26980,Looks like it got messed up at the factory.,26980,2
26980,I haven't even wanted to use it yet.,26980,2
26981,The material is very pretty and soft but I don't know who they fitted this on before deciding on the measurements.,26981,2
26981,It was tiny through the chest and arms and if you have any kind of bust line it will not fit.,26981,2
26981,Weird because the shoulders were as wide as a mans.,26981,2
26981,No female is shaped like this.,26981,2
26981,I was very disappointed and am returning it.,26981,2
26982,I have had this backpack for about 6 months now.,26982,2
26982,I bought it with the intention of bringing it on trips and expected to last for a while.,26982,2
26982,"For the first couple of trips I brought it on, it was fine, but after that it just started to go downhill.",26982,2
26982,"The inside lining where the outside meets the inside began falling apart and the front pocket zipper snapped off completely, so I can't even put a paperclip on it as a quick fix.",26982,2
26982,The zippers started to get stuck randomly even with nothing in the bag.,26982,2
26982,It began deteriorating ~2 months into using it.,26982,2
26982,"Again, this bag was used for trips ONLY; otherwise it was not in use whatsoever.",26982,2
26982,"I never put anything heavier than a water bottle in the bag, but it is already falling apart on me.",26982,2
26982,"Overall, it is a cute bag, but I do not recommend this as a long term backpack.",26982,2
26983,These shoes were ridiculously wide.,26983,2
26983,"We ordered the youth size 1, and they're wide enough for an adult.",26983,2
26983,Disappointed!,26983,2
26984,I am too tal 5'11'' for these stockings,26984,2
26985,The printing was not centered.,26985,2
26986,Broke before I even put it on but took me like 10 minutes to fix so it's cool,26986,2
26987,FIts very small....,26987,2
26988,"Patch constantly comes off, needs to be sewn on",26988,2
26989,Arrived early which I was happy about but ran big and did not fit like shown in picture,26989,2
26990,I was VERY disappointed with this tank after seeing such overall positive reviews about it.,26990,2
26990,I ordered an XL.,26990,2
26990,I usually wear a medium.,26990,2
26990,It was so small I could not even fit it over my head.,26990,2
26990,"I tried to return it, but the shipping cost more than the tank top!",26990,2
26990,II also did not like how the company tried to talk me out of returning it.,26990,2
26990,will try to avoid ordering from this company in the future.,26990,2
26991,"I ordered this in white, and I got baby blue",26991,2
26992,"This is a disappointment, I'm sorry to say.",26992,2
26992,"A cheap leather-look plastic exterior, with a liner that could have used about 1/4"" more fabric so the wallet could be opened flat.",26992,2
26992,The quality is extremely poor for the price - probably equals the quality of a $4.99 wallet at Walmart.,26992,2
26992,Won't be sending it back because no time to return and find another gift.,26992,2
26992,Too bad - it was a charming idea.,26992,2
26993,CC holders started to come unstitched within a month.,26993,2
26993,Closure Snap broke off within 5 weeks.,26993,2
26994,The material is scratchy and thin..,26994,2
26995,"I've tried a number of waist cinchers, and this one created a michelin man look on me.",26995,2
26995,I had several sections of fat poking out!,26995,2
26995,Lol.,26995,2
26995,"Though it was amusing, it didn't work for me.",26995,2
26995,"The other cinchers I""ve tried that work cinch in at the waist and create that hourglass figure.",26995,2
26995,"I think that the design of this that creates the michelin man look is the stripes, so to speak.",26995,2
26995,"Some are stronger than others, and it's sort of an alternating binding thing going on.",26995,2
26995,It's hard to explain.,26995,2
26995,"The company allowed my return, though not for free, even though I believe the product did not work as claimed.",26995,2
26995,I had to pay return shipping.,26995,2
26996,Okay.,26996,2
26996,Whole dress very see-through and thin.,26996,2
26996,Not very good quality.,26996,2
26997,"Actually I order size 5 and I resived size 4 1/2
so that why are to small.",26997,2
26998,This wig came in the wrong color unlike shown in the pictures.,26998,2
26998,Maybe the lighting was different I don't know.,26998,2
26998,"It also came WAY too long, I had to cut it myself (which I'm not too good at) and it ruined the wig.",26998,2
26998,I purchased this wig twice just to make sure it wasn't an error and it came the same way.,26998,2
26998,Besides the shipping (which was ok) this wig wasn't my favorite of the ones I've gotten.,26998,2
26998,If you have a talent for styling wigs and don't mind color differences this one may be good for you.,26998,2
26998,"But for everyone else, I'd personally warn against getting this wig.",26998,2
26999,These pants LOOK great...too bad they don't have quality to match.,26999,2
26999,"Also, if you're an American, I'd recommend going up a size or two since my legs are apparently too big to fit into a size 30 (I normally wear 29-31 range for the waist, I'm 5""8, 150lbs).",26999,2
26999,They don't fit as they do in the picture.,26999,2
26999,"Anyways, I returned these POS jeans because the button IMMEDIATELY came off because it's GLUED ON.",26999,2
26999,Not worth your money,26999,2
27000,way way way too small  lost the receipt so i'll find someone who can wear it,27000,2
27001,Get two sizes larger than what u normally wear,27001,2
27002,"Does not look like the picture, dissapointed",27002,2
27003,Zipper broke on first one I put on.,27003,2
27004,Flexible boning bowed out.,27004,2
27004,Not good compression or support,27004,2
27005,"This made my butt look really, really weird.",27005,2
27005,"I'm on the thinner side and was just looking for some lift, but this cut up under my butt cheeks and made them hang over like weird butt pancakes!",27005,2
27005,I ended up cutting the straps off the bottom and using it as a thong tummy shaper.,27005,2
27006,I bought this dress in XL in orange and love it so I decided to get it in blue and it was so small it is a shirt.,27006,2
27006,Very disappointed.,27006,2
27007,This product is super thin and runs a little large.,27007,2
27008,Fit too small!,27008,2
27009,they're cute but also too long.,27009,2
27009,and they end up facing down when I put them in,27009,2
27010,"For the price of this bag, I would have expected it to be thicker material.",27010,2
27010,It's pretty thin and won't last too long I'm afraid.,27010,2
27010,I ended up purchasing s thicker canvas tote at Target for $3.,27010,2
27011,"Too small, had to give it away.",27011,2
27011,The material doesn't strecht at all so it is not confortable.,27011,2
27012,"Looked really small but it fit, cute though.",27012,2
27013,Bag is not as big as expected.,27013,2
27013,It is a small tote at best.,27013,2
27013,Definitely not large in size.,27013,2
27014,It looks cheap,27014,2
27015,It does ryn small and the material looks shiny and not the highest quality.,27015,2
27015,The color in the dress fades when you put the dress on.,27015,2
27016,"I like the fabric very much, but the underwire doesn't fit or feel right.",27016,2
27016,I'm exchanging it for one without an underwire.,27016,2
27017,Definitely got what i paid for haha.,27017,2
27017,Color is a lot lighter than pictured and the straps are pretty thin.,27017,2
27017,Not the regular thickness you would get with normal suspenders.,27017,2
27017,the overall feel was real cheap.,27017,2
27017,I know for a fact they're only going to last a few wears before the color fades and the buckles break.,27017,2
27017,"If you need an actual pair of suspenders, spend the money and get a decent pair, these will not suffice.",27017,2
27018,Top was to small,27018,2
27019,Pretty but cut small,27019,2
27020,"idk i just don't feel it ... its kinda sexy yes but wrong choice of fabric and those 2 piece of breast pads don't work , looks dumb .",27020,2
27020,"i was a bit disappointed , but im taking it to my tailor hopefully it get fixed .",27020,2
27020,"i hate the gathering it makes in my cookie area and its a bit too big for my waist line cause i come in thin a little after my boobies area and then goes back normal .. "" thin waist line "" so in that part it was big .",27020,2
27020,im not sure if too short but there is a lot of excess fabric below forming a skinnny kinda fit .,27020,2
27020,"for the back , omg so plain and the zipper just don't work  makes me have no shape in this , booty looks flat haha .",27020,2
27020,over all its an okay fit maybe just not for someone who has my body type,27020,2
27021,It was small and material kind of thin.,27021,2
27022,cheap looking,27022,2
27023,Stone fell off the first day I got it.,27023,2
27023,Other than that.,27023,2
27023,It's works fine for what it's for.,27023,2
27024,This fits except for the fact that it makes me look like a silky black marshmallow.,27024,2
27024,It doesn't curve with my waist/lower back.,27024,2
27024,I had to wear it with a utility belt and it only helped a little.,27024,2
27024,Buy the kind with the zipper to pee.,27024,2
27025,"We got a size large for my son who is 14 and not even a big kid, he is skinny and weighs 105lbs.",27025,2
27025,the Large was way too small and short.,27025,2
27025,We are very disappointed especially given he wanted to love the shirt.,27025,2
27025,People go bigger.,27025,2
27025,It kinda look like a small-med if that.,27025,2
27026,The item was no what I expected according to the description.,27026,2
27026,I was looking for sth warm and this looks like sth for the summer time.,27026,2
27026,"If I could, I 'd have returned it.",27026,2
27026,The rest of all the items I bought were excellent.,27026,2
27027,Seemed short on me,27027,2
27028,The product was not at all as shown on the picture to the left.,27028,2
27028,They were very short and very plain.,27028,2
27028,"However, you get what you pay for and they were cheap and they are the right colour brown.",27028,2
27029,I loved them until they faded the first day.,27029,2
27030,I read a few of the other reviews and took note that this would run quite small.,27030,2
27030,I normally wear a dress size 10 or pants size 10 or 12; I'm 5'3 173lbs.,27030,2
27030,36DDD & most of my weight is in my butt & legs.,27030,2
27030,I ordered a XL & it fit pretty good EXCEPT the torso of the outfit is too short and causes camel toe.,27030,2
27030,"The material and color was nice and of course since I'm short, I would've needed heels.",27030,2
27030,If I didn't mind walking with my hands in the pockets the entire time or constantly pulling the crotch area down I would've kept it.,27030,2
27031,I was able to put the tank top on without difficulty.,27031,2
27031,"However, it rolled at the bottom and did give the support as expected.",27031,2
27031,Spanx tank tops have  changed  and do not give the support like they use to .,27031,2
27031,This is like wearing a camisole.,27031,2
27031,"I am used to their previous product, which they do not make anymore.",27031,2
27031,I washed the top after one wearing and it no longer looks white.,27031,2
27031,I will not buy this product again.,27031,2
27032,I ordered size S for my 14 year old daughter since she wears size 5.,27032,2
27032,"And according to the size chart, US clothing size 4-6 falls in the size S.
Therefore, this dress is not true to size.",27032,2
27033,cheap looking,27033,2
27034,ordered a 3xl and some one cut the size out of the inside.,27034,2
27034,It was a small/med for sure will have to sell it.,27034,2
27035,it was too large but that's my fault I got an extra large size but cant believe there was a button missing in the back and I didn't even have an extra button,27035,2
27036,Not what I expected but it serves a purpose,27036,2
27037,So small.,27037,2
27037,A little see through.,27037,2
27037,And the bottom is made so standard that you can't tell if there's a front or a back---so it fits misshapen.,27037,2
27038,small,27038,2
27039,Too small,27039,2
27040,too small  for me,27040,2
27041,It looks much better than it is.,27041,2
27041,The material is not what I hoped for.,27041,2
27041,Probably my own mistake,27041,2
27042,"Hat was too large, not the fitment of it, the entire hat was larger than what the pic shows.",27042,2
27042,"Also, the color is off.",27042,2
27042,The leaves that look brown are actually a bright orange/red.,27042,2
27042,Not what I was looking for.,27042,2
27043,"they are comfortable, however, very fragile - wore them once and it has a run in it",27043,2
27044,I like it but it fell apart on day one.,27044,2
27044,Glad Nana is a seamstress and could put it back together.,27044,2
27045,"color is not what is shown, size to small.",27045,2
27045,Bought bigger then what I wear and still can't fit it.,27045,2
27045,Very disappointed,27045,2
27046,Very sheer,27046,2
27047,Way too small but very cute.,27047,2
27047,Too bad!,27047,2
27048,"I ordered a size up, but apparently I needed two sizes up.",27048,2
27048,"it is really cute, just wish it would have fit :(",27048,2
27049,"It's very cheap looking and while it fits as expected, the way it's made makes it pouf out at the hips and it's very unflattering.",27049,2
27050,"This case looks cool, but it doesn't fit the phone that well.",27050,2
27050,It needs to be bigger where the buttons are and cover more of the sides.,27050,2
27051,One of the cheapest shoes I've ever purchased.,27051,2
27051,you get what you pay for.,27051,2
27051,The shipping cost was ridiculous.,27051,2
27051,Very cute but would never buy again.,27051,2
27052,Size is not sized correctly.,27052,2
27052,Buy 2x bigger if you purchase.,27052,2
27053,Color not as described.,27053,2
27053,"Ordered wine red and it is a very bright (cardinal red) not a deep red or maroon/burgundy color as pictured, otherwise looked nice and fit as expected.",27053,2
27054,"Less than a month and one lent broken good desing, bad materials.",27054,2
27055,Top was way to small,27055,2
27056,they don't go over my calfs,27056,2
27057,"Cost to much ,send the top back.",27057,2
27058,I am 5 8 a size 3 d chest and a butt.,27058,2
27058,I needed a large for anybody with a similar frame.,27058,2
27058,Yes it's set however it's not gray and black it's blue and white,27058,2
27059,"Alas, what I received was NOT what I thought I was ordering.",27059,2
27059,The lenses are not pink - the polrarizing layer turns the view brown.,27059,2
27059,SiGH!,27059,2
27060,Runs extremely small especially through the arm area,27060,2
27061,"The material was very basic, but the look was unattractive on me.",27061,2
27061,Could work in darker colors for a basic plain dress if you want to weare a winter vest over it or something else to jazz it up a bit.,27061,2
27061,"I returned it, and as standing in line in the shop noticed a small nick in the fabric on the front near the shoulder seam.",27061,2
27061,"It's visible, and would show more as washed.",27061,2
27062,"Very cheaply made, flimsy, snags very easily, lots of loose ragged edges that can't be cut off without cutting into actual seams.",27062,2
27062,Will be lucky if it lasts through one wearing (not worn yet).,27062,2
27062,"Hoped to make it a summer staple on steamy hot days but also seems like it will actually be too warm, if you can imagine that (thin but artificial fabric).",27062,2
27062,It was too hot when I tried it on in 60-degree weather.,27062,2
27063,The quality was what you'd expect for the price.,27063,2
27063,"Ultimately, I paired the top (I do like the strappy back!)",27063,2
27063,with a completely different bottom.,27063,2
27064,they shoes are ok but they arrived soaking wet and took a few days to dry out which sucked because my nephew didn't want to wait to wear them but obvisouly had to,27064,2
27065,The dress looks fantastic!,27065,2
27065,"I love the way it looks on me and the pattern/design, however it's a tad long on me (I'm 5'4"") and is a bit loose in the bust and chest, but not bad.",27065,2
27065,"The reason that I can't give this dress more stars though, is the fact that there is a tear along the seam about upper thigh height and I only wore this dress once for a few hours.",27065,2
27065,"I think that it can be repaired, but I would have hoped that the craftsmanship would have prevented the seams from splitting apart after such a short period of time.",27065,2
27065,I had not even washed it by the time this happened.,27065,2
27065,Super disappointed that it has already started to fall apart.,27065,2
27065,"The price was really low for something so nice looking, but probably too low.",27065,2
27065,You get what you pay for.,27065,2
27066,"very sheer, and only for small breasted women.",27066,2
27066,and doesn't come close to hanging off the shoulder unless a child is wearing it.,27066,2
27067,"The bottom part is super cheap, it looks bad and dosent look at all as in the picture , the top part is good, they have to do better with that bottom part, I have a good body but this make look like bad.",27067,2
27067,I would love to give them a good review but sorry.,27067,2
27068,"Super cute and looked just like the picture but if you have boobs, don't buy this dress.",27068,2
27068,I'm a size 3 and a 34 DD.,27068,2
27068,This dress wouldn't fit over my chest.,27068,2
27068,I actually panicked for a second because it got stuck on my boobs.,27068,2
27068,Lol,27068,2
27069,Very awkward fit although does fit as expected.,27069,2
27070,These socks are much smaller than I expected.,27070,2
27070,They are hard to put on and take off pretty disappointed,27070,2
27071,I'm giving this two stars because i've bought this twice.,27071,2
27071,"I misplaced the first one i bought, but i had no problems with it.",27071,2
27071,It looked exactly like it does in the picture and i have no complaints about that one.,27071,2
27071,However the second one i received today is much thinner material and the yin yang symbol is much different looking and the whole necklace just looks off.,27071,2
27071,its ugly.,27071,2
27071,the cord is not the same and its just not good quality like it once was.,27071,2
27072,Beautiful suit but fit way to small.,27072,2

27078,"The item is cute, didn't expect great quality considering the price and it is ok but I ordered an XL size and now my daughter is wearing it, my daughter wears an XS or OO... She actually likes, luckily.",27078,2
27078,I'm never ever buying any clothes from China.,27078,2

27080,"Beautiful dress, the colors exactly like the picture, But very small.",27080,2
27081,"(white and gold beaded cuff)
I have a problem with each of three items I purchased from this seller, and can't begin to say they were in the least cooperative, pleasant or helpful about it.",27081,2
27081,"This bracelet is pretty, but quite 'unfinished'.",27081,2
27081,"As a 'beader' myself, I find that there are entirely too many open ends, where the wires aren't hooked closely enough, they 'catch' on absolutely everything, and will ruin clothing of any type, irreparably.",27081,2
27081,"It's too bad, I think with a little more care and perhaps more time, these bracelets, or 'cuffs', as they're sometimes called, might well have been very nice and even wearable...",27081,2
27081,"The attitude of the seller is another issue, so I'll let other customers reactions help to influence reactions to that, but good luck, nonetheless.",27081,2

27084,Cheap material & poorly made.,27084,2
27085,I am not too impressed with this.,27085,2
27085,"It is pretty but after one week the ""gold"" coating came off and made the necklace look ugly and very cheap.",27085,2
27085,I had given it as a birthday gift and was not happy when I was asked about it less than a week later.,27085,2
27086,I like the style but the bottoms are really see through and the top is too short.,27086,2
27086,I ordered a size small and it was way too tight.,27086,2
27086,"I""m about 5'7 and 110 pounds and my usual size is small so it was a little upsetting.",27086,2
27086,I would not reccomend this bikini to anyone.,27086,2
27087,It's changing colors already,27087,2
27088,Though the fit was great and the color is pretty; it truly is a nice dress.,27088,2
27088,It is however very itchy around the arm and neckline.,27088,2
27088,It's the sequins that were irritating my skin within seconds of trying it on.,27088,2
27088,I would have no use for it and would never wear it for more than a few seconds so I have to return it unfortunately.,27088,2
27089,Got it for my wife but she didn't like it.,27089,2

27092,this product wasn't delivered until April 3rd.,27092,2
27092,about 2 months after is was ordered.,27092,2
27092,thats way too long to wait for clothing to be delivered especially when the estimated delivery time was supposed to be the end of February.,27092,2
27092,The fabric is low quality and the pants are mostly see through.,27092,2
27092,They are also a but small for the size I ordered.,27092,2
27093,Same as on pic but I didn't like it.....will keep it as a spare in case someone needs a suit since I live by the beach,27093,2
27094,Breaks easily.,27094,2
27094,I got it caught on my blanket and it broke apart.,27094,2
27094,Luckily my friend fixed it for me.,27094,2
27095,The size is too large,27095,2
27096,"This will fit my son eventually, I'm sure.",27096,2
27096,But it's giant on him at 2.5 months/11 pounds.,27096,2
27096,I was hoping it was truly a good fit for a newborn.,27096,2
27097,I love this dress and it fit good everywhere but the length.,27097,2
27097,"It was too short and I'm only 5'3""",27097,2
27098,These shoes were much smaller than expected and we had to return them.,27098,2
27098,The outer shell was flimsy and likely wouldn't have supported a toddler foot well.,27098,2
27099,Way too small.,27099,2
27100,"It's ok, It doesn't close if you have 100's",27100,2
27101,"For costume jewelry this is not worth the money... You have to bend the bracelet everytime to get it on and after 3 times wearing it, it is now bent out of shape and the T's don't align... however, while on, the bracelet is HUGE!",27101,2
27101,"Besides this it does look nice, I just don't see it lasting very long.",27101,2
27102,Unfortunately this dress was way too short.,27102,2

27104,Yes...too small,27104,2
27105,I wasn't impressed by this top and the fit wasn't good.,27105,2
27105,I will be returning it.,27105,2
27106,"The fit of this costume was great for me but I'm fairly tall for a female (5'-9"") and without heels, the dress portion would have drug the ground so if you are on the shorter side proceed with caution.",27106,2
27106,My complaint is with the material of the cape/hood.,27106,2
27106,I'm thinking that with all of the other great posts about this product that it is possible the material was recently changed.,27106,2
27106,The hood portion is just two layers of tulle that basically stuck straight up and over my head at about a two foot radius...it doesn't lay down as shown in the photo here.,27106,2
27106,There is a previous review with a photo and it looks like hers laid down and she had no problem with it which is why I think this product has changed.,27106,2
27106,"If it weren't for the hood, I'd give the rest of the outfit 5 stars for the price...",27106,2
27107,"Pretty, but to small for any real ear",27107,2
27108,"The dress was too short and I am 5""5.",27108,2
27108,I Had to cut it extreme short to make if work.,27108,2

27109,"Lenses a little dark, frames warp easily.",27109,2
27110,my daughter did not like this at all,27110,2
27111,Very disappointed.,27111,2
27111,I normally wear a medium so I ordered a medium and it was like I was wearing a men's tshirt.,27111,2
27111,The shirt was huge and kept sliding all over when I was trying to work out.,27111,2
27111,I would return if I could.,27111,2
27111,Save your money,27111,2
27112,I ordered much bigger than I usually do and it was still way to small.,27112,2
27112,If you have and chest at all this will not work for you.,27112,2
27112,The material is also pretty easy to see through.,27112,2
27113,Not fitted as in picture.,27113,2
27113,"Straight, sacky cut, low quality.",27113,2
27114,"Four came, only three worked.",27114,2

27114,The barbell are very short as well.,27114,2
27114,I wished all four studs came in working condition.,27114,2
27115,"The material is nice and thick, but it is WAYYYYY shorter than they let on, and I'm only 5'2''.",27115,2
27115,It's very revealing in the front and completely unwearable.,27115,2
27115,Maybe if you're shorter than 5 foot it would work.,27115,2
27115,Had to return.,27115,2
27116,If you are on the search for stylish palazzo pants these won't cut it.,27116,2
27116,"When people mention that these are see through, they weren't kidding or being over dramatic.",27116,2
27116,The material is nice to the touch but the thread count is so low it resembles cheese cloth.,27116,2
27116,I liked the waistband look with the horizontal pleats and buttons.,27116,2
27116,But the moment I pulled the pants on one of the buttons popped off.,27116,2
27116,"I can fix a button but it was the principle, if I am to pay $17 for these the buttons should last until the 1st washing at least.",27116,2
27116,"If you can find these at a lower price and you have some underthings you don't mind showing off when  you wear them in public then ""hooray"" they are cute pants.",27116,2

27118,Fell apart.,27118,2
27119,No pockets.,27119,2
27119,I mean who doesn't need pockets now a days.,27119,2
27119,I guess I got what I paid for.,27119,2
27120,It took a very long time to receive my product.,27120,2
27120,The watch was very lightweight and it appeared very  generic.,27120,2
27120,I was surprised that the battery worked in it and the picture that came inside of it was pretty clear.,27120,2
27120,My sister loved it so that's all that matter.,27120,2
27121,Arrived within estimated time frame.,27121,2
27121,Packaged nicely also.,27121,2
27121,Unfortunately the color was a bit off and I couldn't get over it and never wore it.,27121,2

27127,"I ordered a large, based on the size chart, which should have provided plenty of room--not the case.",27127,2
27127,I recommend going up a size when ordering.,27127,2
27127,"Also, don't expect the texture or colors to be as nice as pictured.",27127,2
27128,"The length of the sleeves is fine, but the body part is very very short.",27128,2
27129,The breast part is way smaller than expected.,27129,2
27129,"I wear a C bra, got medium, and the below breast seam rides up.",27129,2
27130,Cute bikini but the top is for a child way to small I got an xl and it fit like a xs,27130,2
27131,"They fit a little tight as far as leggings go, but then they slide down too, and on the third time wearing them, I pulled them up and seam ripped in the crotch- and they weren't THAT tight...I fixed the seam and they're fine now, but I just don't enjoy wearing them as much when it requires so much work.",27131,2
27132,I bought a size 2X and it is smaller than the XL sweaters that I have by this same company.,27132,2

4.",27133,2
27133,It costed me $83 on Amazon + $52 to get it from USA to Qatar.,27133,2
27133,I don't think this bag is worth that much for me.,27133,2
27133,5.,27133,2
27133,Price wise $83 for a small bag and that too with not so great finishing is a bit high.,27133,2
27133,"If I were to purchase it from a store, I would not price it more than $50.",27133,2

27138,Wore a better quality suit the next day; no snagging.,27138,2
27138,"The tankini material poofed up and floated around the top of the hot tub, when the the bubbles were turned on; pretty embarrassing.",27138,2
27138,"I ordered the XL, while I'm usually an 8/10, I took the advise of the other review to order a size up, and the top is way too big.",27138,2
27138,"I can't adjust the straps enough to be tight, and got sagging boobs.....boo.",27138,2
27139,This would be a darling dress for someone who is super skinny or who is obviously pregnant.,27139,2
27139,Us women in between those sizes?,27139,2
27139,Not so great.,27139,2
27140,They were a little tricky to get my daughters hands into.,27140,2
27140,I should have gone with mittens instead,27140,2
27141,"Ripped second use, fit is large",27141,2
27142,Good,27142,2
27143,"cheap fabric, doesnt breath, awkward draping.",27143,2
27144,I'm 5'3 and the torso was too long for me.,27144,2
27144,It is a basic suit.,27144,2
27144,No extra help built in to smooth the problem areas.,27144,2
27144,I think it looks more like an 80s mom suit than anything 50s retro.,27144,2
27144,The red v under the bra area loosely hangs and so sometimes bunches up and hangs funny making the suit look cheap.,27144,2
27144,I won't wear it anywhere but the back yard pool.,27144,2
27144,The picture looks way cuter than the suit really is.,27144,2
27145,The skirt honestly looks like a blue star trashbag.,27145,2
27145,Its terrible.,27145,2
27145,The top almost feels like a scratching post.,27145,2
27145,The cape and head piece were the best parts of this costume.,27145,2
27146,Overall a pretty dress just was way to big for me.,27146,2
27147,Way too small.,27147,2
27147,"Order at minimum one size up, maybe two.",27147,2
27147,"I am 5'5"" and weigh between 135 and 130 and I ordered a medium.",27147,2
27148,The shirt fits well.,27148,2
27148,"I'm 5ft6, about 110lbs and I ordered a Medium.",27148,2
27148,"The material feels cheap, a little spandex feeling, but it actually looks fine on.",27148,2
27148,"The problem is, mine didn't come with a string to lace it up, which is the whole point.",27148,2
27148,I'll have to try and find something to replace it that looks right.,27148,2
27149,Item took forever to arrive and when it arrived the paint on the side was not finished.,27149,2
27150,Gave it away.,27150,2
27150,I don't like those huge padded cups.,27150,2
27150,The person in the photo looks big chested like me and I just couldn't get them (boobs) to fit.,27150,2
27151,Nice material but the size is not as excepted.,27151,2
27152,silver washed off in a week,27152,2
27153,"The fabric is so thin, these garments aren't really wearable.",27153,2
27153,"Heavier fabric would have been much, much better.",27153,2
27154,I didn't really like this product .,27154,2
27154,I was expecting it to be way better!,27154,2
27155,"You can't expect much for the price, so I'm not surprised that I didn't like it.",27155,2
27155,I'm a size 0 and I found this skirt to be just a touch too big around the waist.,27155,2
27155,The fabric is also a little too thin for my taste.,27155,2
27155,Again I wasn't expecting much for $15.00.,27155,2
27155,"Suffice to say, that my expectations were met.",27155,2
27156,Cute but too small,27156,2
27157,"material is nice, but shrunk the first washing.",27157,2
27158,Made okay nice material but doesn't form fit to your body.,27158,2
27158,Drapes down your back,27158,2
27159,The dress was very pretty but to big under the arm area and the slip underneath was too short.,27159,2
27160,I received my size Large and it was a bit tight.,27160,2
27160,I am 5'10 and I weigh 155lbs.,27160,2
27160,"The Large should have been adequate, but was tight.",27160,2
27160,XL would probably fit better for a slim guy like me.,27160,2
27160,"If you are over 6' and 180lbs, do not buy this product, as any size will surely be too small to fit.",27160,2
27160,"Additionally, I had to reinforce every single button with stitching because all of the buttons were stitched on very flimsily.",27160,2
27160,My advice?,27160,2
27160,Proceed with caution.,27160,2
27161,Too heavy!,27161,2
27161,It's just too uncomfortable.,27161,2
27161,Seems very well built though.,27161,2
27162,"XXL fits like a medium to large; otherwise, nice shirt.",27162,2
27163,ok quality.,27163,2
27163,fit is very small - won't fit grown man.,27163,2
27164,Beautiful look but inside lining feels like paper.,27164,2
27165,so called leather tore,27165,2
27166,Dislike!,27166,2
27167,"This is too small, I am 5ft 1 inch 118 lbs.",27167,2
27167,I ordered a small.,27167,2
27167,"I re-ordered a medium, it just arrived today.",27167,2
27167,"I like it, it too is too small.",27167,2
27167,Now I have two new dresses that I cannot get into.,27167,2
27167,I love the look of the dress.,27167,2
27167,I may try ordering the large,27167,2
27168,"Cheaply made, extremely small in shoulder and breast area.",27168,2
27168,Restocking fee.,27168,2
27169,"This bra is very pretty, but it fits weird.",27169,2
27169,It's one of those clothing items that looks great on the model/mannequin but looks funny when it's on your own body.,27169,2
27169,I bought it to wear under my off the shoulder shirts that I bought to wear this summer.,27169,2
27169,"When I sat down one side of the bra completely flipped upside down which was actually kind of funny, but not funny enough to keep the bra so I ended up returning it.",27169,2
27170,"The fit is accurate, but this is sheer, cheap material.",27170,2
27170,"You can see a bra through it as clear as daylight, so make sure it coordinates with the shirt color.",27170,2
27170,It hasn't been worn more than once and already has runs in the fabric.,27170,2
27170,Not good quality.,27170,2
27171,Looks gray when looking thru them.,27171,2
27171,On the smaller size for the frames.,27171,2
27172,Beautiful corset but confusing size instructions.,27172,2
27172,Actual waist size may have worked....,27172,2
27173,"I usually wear a medium, however ordered a large due to the reviews.",27173,2
27173,I received an XL and oddly enough the bottom fit really tight !,27173,2
27173,The top fit extremelyyyy lose which didn't make sense considering the bottom was so tight.,27173,2
27173,It is as pictured however and is beautiful and vibrant.,27173,2
27173,However I probably won't ever get to wear it due to the poor making of this swimsuit.,27173,2
27174,It does not look like the photo,27174,2
27175,Pretty but very poorly made.,27175,2
27175,The clip/backings fell off after only 3 times wearing them.,27175,2
27176,Looking forward to a refund as it was too small,27176,2
27177,No a good design at all.,27177,2
27177,Unhappy with this purchase,27177,2
27178,CLUMSY WITHDRAWAL OF CREDIT CARDS.,27178,2
27179,Super baggy.,27179,2
27180,This is a tiny shirt.,27180,2
27180,Nothing close to a dress.,27180,2
27180,Like the colors... but I shouldn't have to buy 4 sizes up to get the right fit.,27180,2
27181,"Pretty cheap looking for the price, smelled funny coming out of the box.",27181,2
27181,"For the price, you could get something better elsewhere",27181,2
27182,"They fit as expected, especially while being 8 months preggo, but these are see through.",27182,2
27182,I cannot wear these out in public as I hoped.,27182,2
27182,I have pj bottoms thicker than these are.,27182,2
27182,"The bottoms are not hemmed, just looks like a pair of palooza pants that were trimmed to be culottes.",27182,2
27183,"I gave my mom my ""extra large"" she wears size 2.",27183,2
27184,"Cute but earrings are very bendable not high quality, came quickly tho",27184,2
27185,"The shirt is nice, but it runs very small.",27185,2
27185,"If you are a size small, you would probably need to order a large or extra large.",27185,2
27186,"Product is great, just what I was looking for.",27186,2
27186,"However, it is advertised as s ""set of four"" yet I was sent 1 pendant each of the two times I ordered.",27186,2
27186,I had to order twice because I needed two pendants for my cabinet.,27186,2
27187,This sweater is soft  but also very stretchy  and cheap made.,27187,2
27187,I don't think it'll  survive after first laundry.,27187,2
27187,But the main problem for me is length .,27187,2
27187,"Im 5""2 and and I expected this sweater  being long enough to wear with leggings .But it's too short,and doesnt look like on the pic at all.",27187,2
27188,itchy,27188,2
27189,its not as big as it shows in the picture,27189,2
27190,This dress was far too small.,27190,2
27190,"It is not designed for someone over 5'5"".",27190,2
27190,"The fabric was very thin and reminded me of a Halloween costume, not a dress that could be worn out in public.",27190,2
27190,It was very cheaply made.,27190,2
27191,"This might work if you are a size 0, but if your stomach bends when you sit, then don't expect this to stay where you put it!",27191,2
27191,"The photo makes it look like it can pull the back of the bra down about 2 inches, (which is what I needed), but in reality, the strap rides up and the back of the bra rides up.",27191,2
27191,"In the future, I think I would spend a little more money and get a different product.",27191,2
27192,not what expected,27192,2
27193,"The photo of the ring shows a light-colored stone with turquoise and blues but when I
received the ring it was a dark-colored stone, still pretty but not like the stone in the
photo.",27193,2
27194,They were too small,27194,2
27195,"It's cute, but PEOPLE IT IS NOT GOLD!!!!!",27195,2
27195,Not even silver!,27195,2
27195,"Don't take a shower with it, or no pool party!",27195,2
27195,It turned black in 3 days :(,27195,2
27196,"I'm 5'7"" and this dress hits at mid knee.",27196,2
27196,Very unflattering.,27196,2
27196,"It's too big, like a tent.",27196,2
27196,"I ordered red, its maroon.",27196,2
27197,"Washed the backpack, since my toddler is on break from school.",27197,2
27197,"It ripped right down the middle in the wash.  What is the point, if it can't be washed.",27197,2
27197,So disappointed.,27197,2
27198,I was really surprised how small it ran.,27198,2
27198,I'm usually a L and I couldn't even get of over my shoulders.,27198,2
27199,The leggings are definitely warm but they do not stay up.,27199,2
27199,They keep falling down and it's difficult to wear.,27199,2
27200,Not as pictured very cheap looking,27200,2
27201,"I thought I responded to this, dress was a little on the small side and I did not like the high waist line.",27201,2
27201,Plan to have it altered.,27201,2
27202,"I thought this would be really cute, had to reorder it down a size.",27202,2
27202,The corset part does not stay flat and keeps bunching up.,27202,2
27203,This is made for a very busty person.,27203,2
27204,They slip around and are too too thin.,27204,2
27204,They don't have a grippy patch at he heel so you are always digging around in your shoe which is super unprofessional.,27204,2
27204,Digging around anywhere during a meeting is unprofessional.,27204,2
27204,Don't do it.,27204,2
27205,They felt very crooked on my face and also came with a scratch.,27205,2
27205,I also didn't really like how the clear frame went with the mirror.,27205,2
27205,Giving would give one star but because they paid for shipping and the return process went quite smoothly I'm giving them two.,27205,2
27206,Returned the item,27206,2
27207,I HAVE RETURNED THIS HAT,27207,2
27208,Too short and body for my taste.,27208,2
27208,Stiff fabric.,27208,2
27209,One size fits all leaves a lot left over if a size 10; hopefully will shrink some.,27209,2
27210,"this earrings are and look very cheap,don't even bother.",27210,2
27211,Fits perfectly everywhere except the shoulders.,27211,2
27211,The straps won't stay up!,27211,2
27211,The color is beautiful tho.,27211,2
27212,This coat was not true to size.,27212,2
27212,I ordered a 2x and it fit like a large.,27212,2
27212,I don't wear a 2x but I ordered that size for more room and it was still to small.,27212,2
27212,The coat is very nice and I really liked it but I had to give it away because of the fit.,27212,2
27213,The lining is longer than the dress when I tried it on.,27213,2
27213,I really loved the dress though!,27213,2
27214,"These are not ""long""as stated...they have no shape...no stretch.",27214,2
27214,..complete waste of money....they went directly into the Goodwill pile,27214,2
27215,"A few issues, which made me return and not reorder...",27215,2
27215,Size / compatibility.,27215,2
27215,The shoe is designed too be much smaller than previous models.,27215,2
27215,Minimus have been fine as 12s for me.,27215,2
27215,"This, however, was too small at a 12.",27215,2
27215,Fit.,27215,2
27215,Very narrow.,27215,2
27215,Not nearly as comfortable or close to the ground as previous models.,27215,2
27215,It seems to fit a specific type of foot only (not mine).,27215,2
27215,"I did not have a good feel for the ground, like i did with previous models.",27215,2
27215,Quality.,27215,2
27215,Disappointing.,27215,2
27215,The sore on my shoe is not glued to the top well.,27215,2
27215,Uneven and looking cheap.,27215,2
27215,Previous models were cheaper and of higher quality.,27215,2
27215,Tongue.,27215,2
27215,Is not as helpful anymore.,27215,2
27215,"As it is not fully attached to the show, you have to do some fiddling.",27215,2
27215,"Not well
designed.",27215,2
27215,I highly recommend all the previous models.,27215,2
27216,"Not sure about other styles offered, but this style made all of my shoes too snug to fit comfortably - especially in the toe area.",27216,2
27216,I plan to return these and try a different model.,27216,2
27217,Too large,27217,2
27218,"I always wanted to buy a black velvet necklace, it came earlier than expected but, the size was lager than my neck, the second time I tried it the clasp and the chain broke.",27218,2
27218,"I just wanted to leave this review here, I usally don't write any reviews...",27218,2
27219,Item is not true to size according to the size chart specifically for this item.,27219,2
27220,"The pendent is pretty, but the shawl is not.",27220,2
27220,I have however decided to keep it.,27220,2
27220,"Tie the shawl around my neck, then cut the rest of the shawl off  and wear it like a necklace.",27220,2
27220,I might even go get the hardware for a lovely clasp.,27220,2
27220,Or just cut the ends off and make fringes.,27220,2
27221,Hard to get on...I got worn out just trying to clip all the hooks and fought to zip it up .LOL HOWEVER....once on It felt okay.,27221,2
27222,It was very oddly shaped and cheap material...cannot wear it.,27222,2
27223,cute tee M fits like an XS,27223,2
27224,Bar way too small and the balls are very tiny.,27224,2
27224,They are hard to take off.,27224,2
27225,the dress is nice but was to small,27225,2
27226,Does not keep time.,27226,2
27226,Does not wind easy.,27226,2
27227,Loved the fit and print.,27227,2
27227,"However, the printed fabric was somewhat see through.",27227,2
27228,Much larger (the lizard) and ostentatious than I thought.,27228,2
27228,Returned,27228,2
27229,It fell apart after one wash!,27229,2
27230,Way too big for a medium; they must've seen me a large instead.,27230,2
27231,"Cute bag, I bought 2 and both had the left strap tear in the same place within a week.",27231,2
27231,Seems like a manufacturer defect.,27231,2
27231,I'm afraid to try and order again,27231,2
27232,"Cute, the fabric feels cheap...bummed me out.",27232,2
27233,Even used the size chart but still the XL was more like a 2X.,27233,2
27234,Didn't like the feeling..cheap,27234,2
27235,too tight and too short,27235,2
27236,This was a nice material and very pretty color but it was gigantic.,27236,2
27236,I am 5ft 10 and the large was down almost below my knees.,27236,2
27237,No good,27237,2
27238,Way too big for me.,27238,2
27238,Sad,27238,2
27239,These were very small.,27239,2
27239,I ordered a size up and still too small.,27239,2
27239,Cheaply made as well.,27239,2
27240,Well...,27240,2
27240,It's a hat.,27240,2
27240,What can you say.,27240,2
27240,The one I received is too large buy maybe I picked the wrong size.,27240,2
27241,disappointed with the quality of fabric,27241,2
27242,The shirt I ordered was not actually white it is cream...,27242,2
27242,I got a XXL Based on the reviews & it fits like a 10-12...,27242,2
27243,It was smaller than it looked in the picture,27243,2
27244,Too small pinched parts to much,27244,2
27245,Would be a nice bag if not for the weird zipper.,27245,2
27245,"It's not sewn end to end on the bag and it's got a ""tail"" that's about 4"" that just hangs there.",27245,2
27245,The color is not exactly as shown either.,27245,2
27245,i got the red bag but the color is more faded than the photo online.,27245,2
27245,I'm returning the bag.,27245,2
27246,It was a gift for a woman.,27246,2
27246,It ended up a bit tight I thought.,27246,2
27246,"I offered to get it exchanged, she was happy and said she wanted to keep it.",27246,2
27246,i let her keep it it was a xmas present.,27246,2
27246,Now 1 month latter I now know it was a very bad buy the jacket coat is coming unsewed all over the pokets are coming of under the arms ripped open and I cant exactly say what else is wrong scinse she has it and I cant look at it at this presnt time.,27246,2
27246,Bruce,27246,2
27247,Way too small.,27247,2
27247,Gave it away to someone smaller.,27247,2
27248,the material is very obviously cheap.,27248,2
27249,Too small to be an large,27249,2
27250,"Surprisingly good wuality, and incredibly cute but I ordered an extra large and got an ""extra large"" that fits like an extra small...",27250,2
27250,Waiting a month and a half and was pretty excited so that was disappointing but great for someone who wears smalls,27250,2
27251,I love this vendor but the sizes are off with this top.,27251,2
27251,The sleeves were too long and the bodice was too tight.,27251,2
27251,I ordered a large because I sent back a different PattyBoutik top that was an XL and it was too large.,27251,2
27251,I ordered this for a Valentine's party and was disappointed that it did not fit.,27251,2
27251,PS  I am a normal size 12.,27251,2
27251,The tight sleeves were weird!,27251,2

27252,"Material is nice, but they didn't even reach my ankles.",27252,2
27253,Is WAY too small.,27253,2
27253,"If it fit, it would have looked good... but top appears to be cheap and looks to be coming apart.",27253,2
27254,There is something seriously wrong with this blouse and I cannot put my finger on it.,27254,2
27254,The cut is very weird.,27254,2
27254,I think it might be the chest doesn't accommodate breasts like it was made for a man or something.,27254,2
27254,Material is a little scratchy but is pretty and does drape nice.,27254,2
27254,"Overall, I couldn't put this thing back on after my initial try on so I gave it away.",27254,2
27254,I cannot recommend this product.,27254,2
27255,Glue was clearly visible on the flap where the jewels are located.,27255,2
27255,"In fact, it stuck to the tissue paper that it was wrapped in.",27255,2
27256,I purchased these panties form review trader on a whim.,27256,2
27256,New boyfriend and all.,27256,2
27256,They took a while to ship from Asia.,27256,2

27256,and well made.,27256,2
27256,"They are a one size fits all
and....Basically sized for a 4 year old.",27256,2
27256,":(

I am sad because they are so cute.",27256,2
27256,Oh well.,27256,2
27257,I have been wearing another brand for about 10 years (started wearing silicone adhesive bras in high school) and Target stopped selling my favorite brand.,27257,2
27257,These were thinner and stiffer than others I have had and the adhesive barely lasted 1 wear.,27257,2
27257,I usually get about 20-40 wears from other brands.,27257,2
27257,At least they weren't expensive.,27257,2
27257,Oh well back to the drawing board.,27257,2
27258,omg when I seen this it's so beautiful I couldn't wait to older this is was so happy and in love with this and I spend my money's but when it came it still look the way it did in the picture the only problem I had have is that I couldn't fit it I'm a size 8 and it feel like a 7 idk if they made a mistake when they send this out 2 me but I couldn't fit this is never contact info was just made and hurt but this a beautiful I try older them again soon b4 it snow coming up,27258,2
27259,Returned it.,27259,2
27259,"Fabric is very thick, the cut is not like the photo.",27259,2
27260,Love the look but broke very quickly!,27260,2
27261,"If you're shopping for the fabric/because you enjoy the pattern, you're set.",27261,2
27261,"If you're buying this with the aim of having a well-made skirt, though, you're out of luck.",27261,2
27261,Skirt came with uneven hem and lacked a zipper closure.,27261,2
27262,Really really stiff (it crackles even).,27262,2
27263,So these were warm and not comfortable.,27263,2
27263,The style was a bit snug and it basically just smushes your stuff into you.,27263,2
27263,All in all not a good pair of underwear in my opinion.,27263,2
27264,Wish I would've tried these on before washing them so I could return them.,27264,2
27264,"I'm giving a 2 star rating because the fabric is soft & the quantity is nice for the price, but the elastic is so tight, left a mark on my 2 month old's wrists after only a half hour & that was even with a sleeve barrier.",27264,2
27264,"Description says 0-6 months sizing, there's no way they'd fit a 3+ month old.",27264,2
27265,This had no chance of fitting my pandora bracelet.,27265,2
27265,It's cute but i had to return it.,27265,2
27265,:(,27265,2
27266,The fit is awkward,27266,2
27267,I'm a 32B.,27267,2
27267,Slim frame.,27267,2
27267,120 lbs.,27267,2
27267,And the bottom was the only thing that fit me.,27267,2
27267,The top was too big.,27267,2
27267,Had to give it to my sister.,27267,2
27268,These pajama pants are much to long and the waist does not stretch,27268,2
27269,This gave me a stomache ache from too much constriction so I never really wore it.,27269,2
27270,Terrible!,27270,2
27270,You get what you pay for!,27270,2
27270,Zipper and other part of the bag broke after two uses.,27270,2
27271,I got light blue and when i ordered it It was a turtle neck and i would not recommend it but it was comortable,27271,2
27272,"This shirt is too tiny, and the fabric is crap",27272,2
27273,This dress is pretty designed.,27273,2
27273,But totally smaller than the size described in the size chart.,27273,2
27273,I suggest order one size up.,27273,2
27273,"Also there is a dirty mark on the back, I thought it supposed to be brand new?",27273,2
27274,The size was off and the camo print on my ring was off.,27274,2
27274,Returning,27274,2
27275,It's not very soft and the quality isn't great,27275,2
27276,Did not like this at all.,27276,2
27276,The material is thin polyester and see thru and does not provide anykind of support.,27276,2
27276,For the price I was expecting it to be of good quality,27276,2
27277,They look and feel nice enough.,27277,2
27277,Problem was they put a rash around both of my sons calves.,27277,2
27277,"He has NEVER been sensitive or had skin issues with clothing, food, soaps, etc.",27277,2
27277,Not sure what this fabric was treated with but looks like a chemical burn on his skin.,27277,2
27277,Buyer beware!,27277,2
27277,!,27277,2
27278,Don't buy these.,27278,2
27278,After about 3 months the velcro wouldn't hold anymore and kept coming undone.,27278,2
27279,Didnt exactly do the job i wanted to do.,27279,2
27279,It was very uncomfortable.,27279,2
27280,I am 5'7 160 lbs and a curvy build.,27280,2
27280,"I am not large by any means and expected the medium to fit just right, but they are huge!",27280,2
27280,"I understand that scrub like bottoms are suppose to be a little big, but these swallow me.",27280,2
27280,They are long and definitely flare legged.. a little too flare for this girl.,27280,2
27280,Based on the product review from other customers I though I would love these pants but I am very unsatisfied.,27280,2
27280,I will be returning these.,27280,2
27281,"The material is cheap, not worth it",27281,2
27282,I was excited to go to the gym wearing this but they're too small and I cant fit them at all,27282,2
27283,The back of the dress is very cheaply made and the dress over all is over paid for,27283,2
27284,Does not have the support I was hoping for.,27284,2
27284,Not a bra for even medium-impact activities if you're chesty (I'm a 34DD).,27284,2
27284,"I'll sleep in this bra and maybe do yoga, but that's it.",27284,2
27285,"Too see through, too small (even considering the sizing guide) and had an odd smell.",27285,2
27285,"Perhaps the smell would come out after a wash or two, but wasn't worth keeping around to try.",27285,2
27286,This necklace is pretty but kind of looks cheap up close.,27286,2
27286,"And it is cheap, it broke the second time I wore it.",27286,2
27286,I know you get what you pay for but I was hoping it would last a little longer.,27286,2
27287,These shoes are poorly constructed and I don't expect them to last more that one summer.,27287,2
27287,"Would not recommend, and will not order another Nike downshifter series again",27287,2
27288,The fabric is fine overall but the socks don't have the compression I was expecting.,27288,2
27289,Looked great bum became see though after wearing for the summer.,27289,2
27289,So for that not happy.,27289,2
27290,did great till the glue came off and now its just junk,27290,2
27291,cheaply made but you get what you pay for,27291,2
27292,ordered a kids small and if was way too big.,27292,2
27293,This dress fits more like a size 4 for a very busty woman.,27293,2
27294,Annoyed with the front wheel.,27294,2
27294,If it could retract like the back one it'd be cool but you end up taking it off and they shake without the front wheel just fine so don't bother getting the front wheel kind.,27294,2
27295,I ordered white - very thin.,27295,2
27295,My husband asked if I was going to wear an undershirt because he could see every detail on my bra thru the shirt.,27295,2
27295,"It's cute, not exactly like the picture.",27295,2
27295,The lace is not as nice or as well sewn into the shirt.,27295,2
27295,The band of lace that appears to run the seam of the underarm is actually not attached to the shirt - it just hangs like a flap.,27295,2
27296,Color is true to picture; loose batting is truly loose.,27296,2
27296,Do not think it will be durable.,27296,2
27296,Will most likely return the product.,27296,2
27297,NOT 4 ME,27297,2
27298,It's cheap quality.,27298,2
27299,Great price but way too small.,27299,2
27300,Short and tight.,27300,2
27301,"Looks better in picture, Quality is not the greatest and is kind of blurry when you see that earrings in person, also that earrings are actually kind of big, almost the size of a dime.",27301,2
27302,way way way too small,27302,2
27303,The printing is of very low quality.,27303,2
27303,There are white streaks in the black.,27303,2
27303,I thought it might come out by washing but it didn't.,27303,2
27303,It's also incredibly small for a 2XL.,27303,2
27303,Takes a very long time to ship.,27303,2
27304,This bra is more like a casual wireless bra.,27304,2
27304,There is no way this would even support running or high impact activities.,27304,2
27304,"Also, the cups don't open up fully like most other nursing bras.",27304,2
27305,The measurements on the size chart are WAY off.,27305,2
27305,I ordered a 2XL based on the size chart and expecting the shirt to run small.,27305,2
27305,Big mistake.,27305,2
27305,It fits me like a real size 3XL.,27305,2
27305,The shoulder area is so wide that it just looks ridiculous on me.,27305,2
27305,I can't wear this out in public because it just looks awful.,27305,2
27305,I'm not bothering to send it back.,27305,2
27305,Too much of a hassle.,27305,2
27305,I'll just keep it as a soft night shirt for the summer.,27305,2
27305,That's about all I can use it for.,27305,2
27306,"No padding or support whatsoever, zipper sticks and drags hard, and you have to work really hard to get them open to put your foot in or out.",27306,2
27307,All but one of the items in the box we received were silver.,27307,2
27307,"There was only one gold toy in the box, and only one chain (silver color).",27307,2
27307,"We are returning the box because the color of the toys received is not as advertised (all should be gold color, like in the photo).",27307,2
27307,"The toys are small but overall a good size for a kid to play with, they are heavy metal with a nice clear finish, and if they were gold color, we would be happy with this purchase.",27307,2
27308,Disappointing.,27308,2
27308,Bought this for my formal and it was beautiful but too big and the fabric appeared more expensive in the image than it tangibly was.,27308,2
27308,Didn't want the hassle of returning the dress.,27308,2
27308,Maybe one day i'll get it tailored for me.,27308,2
27308,That way it won't be a waste of money.,27308,2
27309,Really cheaply made.,27309,2
27309,Don't bother.,27309,2
27309,I'm gonna donate it.,27309,2
27310,Ive had this case for a little under 2 months and the fold over has cracked  apart,27310,2
27311,"when this product arrived I Loved it.. but then i noticed there was a whole on the upper left hand shoulder of the shirt,  also noticed  a whole on the sweat pants on the back side..  the product it self would have been very nice if it wasn't for it being defective.",27311,2
27311,sweat pants are nice and thick for the cold weather nice little vest too.. i wish i could buy it again.,27311,2
27311,"but i won't be doing that because of the wholes that i found on my ""new"" product.",27311,2
27312,cheap,27312,2
27313,Luckily I read the reviews before I ordered.,27313,2
27313,"Got an XL for my petite niece, and it's only a little roomy.",27313,2
27313,Wash and dry once and it should fit her.,27313,2
27314,This is a very thin material and not as bright as pictured.,27314,2
27314,"It is almost a ""see-thru"" material.",27314,2
27314,If this was a thicker material as it looks in the photo then it would be awesome.,27314,2
27314,I would not purchase this item again.,27314,2
27315,Not great quality for use daily.,27315,2
27315,It was a great size to keep papers organized.,27315,2
27316,Humongous on my child - wears a solid 4T in everything but these will for her in a year or more.,27316,2
27317,It's seems to me as plastic.,27317,2
27318,Ordered a size 12 and received an XXL,27318,2
27319,"shirt bought as Extra Large, would barely be medium.",27319,2
27319,Waste of money.,27319,2
27320,It's way to big in the waist so I'm not able to wear it until I find someone who can take it apart and fix it.,27320,2
27320,So disappointed:(,27320,2
27321,nothing special,27321,2
27322,"Very beautiful necklace, but it broke less than a week after I gave it to my girlfriend for Valentines Day :(",27322,2

27324,Do not like it,27324,2
27325,Way too small but cute.. Just don't wear it out in public.. Hah,27325,2
27326,It was smaller than what I expected.,27326,2
27326,Looking for something in a bigger gauge.,27326,2
27327,"This wasn't what I expected at all, I actually referenced the listing when it arrived.",27327,2
27327,The patchwork wouldn't stay on the elbows.,27327,2
27327,"I removed them, wore the cardigan once and got rid of it.",27327,2
27328,This is a beautiful ring but the ad is very misleading.,27328,2
27328,This is a silver filled ring.,27328,2
27328,It started turning me blue after just a week of having it.,27328,2
27329,Would be cute if the lil flowers didn't pop off as you were putting them on your luggage.,27329,2
27330,Does not stand up and beads have already fallen off!,27330,2
27330,!,27330,2
27331,The pin backing came loss when my grandson dropped the badge.,27331,2
27331,It's not worth it the money spend.,27331,2
27332,"The embellishments fell off rather quickly, and the scarf itself wasn't that sturdy either.",27332,2
27333,It was too small.,27333,2
27333,Order a size bigger,27333,2
27334,Not as nice or cute as foto.,27334,2

27338,My measurements are Bust 41 waist 36.,27338,2
27338,If anything this dress should have been tight on me but I was swimming in this.,27338,2
27338,"So much so, that I could not even get an idea of how this dress would look in a smaller size.",27338,2
27338,"The style is lovely from the pictures and lovely on the posted reviewers, but mine was horrible.",27338,2
27338,Maybe it was mismarked.,27338,2
27338,Judging from how big it was I should have taken a small.,27338,2
27338,I love the style but am afraid to try again.,27338,2
27338,It should have gotten 1 star from me but it looked good on others so I gave it 1 more star.,27338,2
27339,I READ ALL THE REVIEWS PRIOR TO ORDERING.,27339,2
27339,EVERYONE SAID THAT THIS ITEM RAN BIG.,27339,2
27339,"SO, I ORDERED ONE SIZE SMALLER DUE TO BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THE LENGTH.",27339,2

27347,The gem is dingy and floats around the box it's in.,27347,2
27347,"Was going to be a gift for my 13 year old, but decided against it.",27347,2
27348,way longer than you would expect.,27348,2
27348,Long delivery also - move to another more local name before this one.,27348,2
27348,Also the ropes or whatever they are that hang from the legs are super long.,27348,2
27348,More like men's Carpi's then shorts.,27348,2
27348,I like my shorts longer to my knees or so but these are almost pants.,27348,2
27348,Material is top notch though.,27348,2
27349,"Though the photo does not show capped sleeves, but sadly they are capped.",27349,2

27354,One of them was broken,27354,2
27355,"If you have any boobs at all, don't buy.",27355,2
27355,"Also, I thought it was a dress as it's advertised.",27355,2
27355,While I'm 5'9 its definitely more of a long tshirt that would look silly if worn with anything but jeans.,27355,2
27356,The images for this suit are misleading.,27356,2
27356,There are cups built into it that give you that 1940s torpedo boob thing going on.,27356,2
27356,"That, plus my GG cups were way too bug for it.",27356,2
27356,I had to return.,27356,2

27359,"The size was great (I wear a small top usually), although, it does not lay like the picture.",27359,2
27359,"However, I returned it bc there was ink stains on one of the sleeves (either worn before or from shipping?).",27359,2
27359,And the color is more of a dark tan than a beige.,27359,2

27372,"The bottom, skirt area, super cute, it flares, etc.",27372,2
27373,"Ordered an xl , looks more like a medium",27373,2
27374,"It's a nice bag but it's a nylon material, not canvas like the description.",27374,2
27374,I was looking for a canvas bag for daily use.,27374,2
27374,This looks like a piece of luggage.,27374,2
27375,Pom Pom fell off within 1 week of receiving :(,27375,2
27376,looks cheap,27376,2
27377,Wouldn't buy an adjustable one that's cheeper,27377,2
27378,It was both too large and too small at the same time.,27378,2
27378,"The hips were way too small while the boning was way too big, which is a problem I've never, ever had before.",27378,2
27378,It also shed sequins like nobody's business.,27378,2
27378,They're everywhere.,27378,2
27379,This product was WAY too big.,27379,2
27379,I have to wear a shirt under it to wear it.,27379,2
27379,Wish I had returned it.,27379,2
27379,"Otherwise, good quality shirt.",27379,2
27380,Chain that came with it was way too small,27380,2
27381,I had high hopes for this bathing suit.,27381,2
27381,"The bottoms fit great, high waisted as shown in the picture.",27381,2
27381,I like how the bottoms fit tight.,27381,2
27381,"So, had I actually used this to go swimming, I am confident I wouldn't have the saggy butt effect which happens to many bathing suits once it's been exposed to the elements.",27381,2
27381,The quality of the fabric seems decent for the price.,27381,2
27381,"The bra cups are padded which I like, but they seem spread out too far apart and therefore it looked funny on me.",27381,2
27381,Maybe this would look better on someone with a more voluptous figure.,27381,2
27381,This was not flattering to my body type (slender and petite).,27381,2
27381,It seems to me that the pattern wasn't adjusted for the smaller sizes.,27381,2
27382,One of the two set of stats works great and claps the shirt very well.,27382,2
27382,The other side doesn't stay on at all.,27382,2
27382,I attach the stay to the bottom of the shirt and as soon as I put the stirrup around my foot the shirt stay pops right off.,27382,2
27382,The only way I can get the stay to work properly is to fold the shirt over and force extra into the clasp to get it to stay.,27382,2
27382,The molded plastic is not sufficient to hold my shirt in place.,27382,2
27382,I will be looking for a new set of stays immediately.,27382,2
27383,Real cute but strap is cheep looking,27383,2
27384,They say it fits 2 to 4 year old.,27384,2
27384,Not true.,27384,2
27384,Good fit for a 1 - 2 year old only.,27384,2
27384,The pompons fall in the first wash.,27384,2
27385,The glasses  are great.,27385,2
27385,But I compared the case with my sister's original rayban case and the leather of my case is much weaker and thinner.,27385,2
27385,So that really makes me wonder the authencity of the product.,27385,2
27386,Runs small and very thin.,27386,2
27386,Looks cheap,27386,2
27387,Cheap material.,27387,2
27387,"Overall, it looks cute.",27387,2
27387,I got a medium and it fits me pretty well.,27387,2
27388,"The tool works okay, but with the rounded base, It is hard to line up the watch band in the tool.",27388,2
27388,"It is metal, but that means little when it is hard to work the tool.",27388,2
27389,Cheap,27389,2
27390,"The blue depicted in the photograph is a lighter pastel, the actual thing looks like a more neon baby blue.",27390,2
27390,The under lining is extremely short and reaches just above crotch.,27390,2
27390,"The chiffon is long enough to cover what the under lining doesn't, but it's see through so not much of a help.",27390,2
27390,Over all not a cute dress in person or on.,27390,2
27391,Will this belt last you 3 yrs?,27391,2
27391,I don't think so.,27391,2
27391,"Will it last 2 yrs, I'm not even sure about that.",27391,2
27391,"The main reason I see a longevity issue is that when you open the belt release to take it off, the teeth get caught in the fibers of the belt material.",27391,2
27391,"I've worn it one day and there are 3 snags that have been pulled up from the teeth not giving a ""clean release"".",27391,2
27391,"Along with that comes the fact that I can't get it off in one motion, I have to open it up, pull it tighter (to clear any of the belt fabric from the teeth) and then pull the belt off...",27391,2
27391,"So far, it has been a hassle.",27391,2
27391,"I blame the teeth, if it had a flat bar across to grip instead it probably wouldn't snag on the belt fabric.",27391,2
27391,I like these kinds of belts for clean look you get so I'll try a different one.,27391,2
27391,This one is really inexpensive but I don't think it is worth the little money it costs regardless.,27391,2
27392,I am very disappointed bc the bikini is very large  while the bras is very small and I ordered all numbers and still very small while bikini super large.,27392,2
27392,who makes outfits like that??,27392,2
27392,?,27392,2
27393,"As mention before, the gold necklace is not part of the shirt which i was really looking fowards to.",27393,2
27393,"The size runs small so order one size bigger, if you are XL i don't advice you to buy since it won't fit.",27393,2
27393,It did come faster than stated though so that's a plus.,27393,2
27394,"I love the idea of having pockets, long sleeves and the style of this nightgown however;  the pin tucking at the bust is irritating.",27394,2
27394,It's beautiful but not comfortable.,27394,2
27394,I washed and wore it once.,27394,2
27394,So disappointed.,27394,2
27395,Run way too small,27395,2
27396,The band looks fine and the quality is good.,27396,2
27396,The reason for my 2 star rating is the band was delivered without the buckle.,27396,2
27396,"When I replaced my old buckle, the watch repair man used my old buckle on this watch strap.",27396,2
27397,We ordered size 6-7 for my 7 yr old who wears size 5-6.,27397,2
27397,The bottoms and tail were too small - could have fit a 4 yr old.,27397,2
27397,"The top was too big, could have fit a developing 12 yr old.",27397,2
27397,"Fabric was thin, soft and color was vibrant.",27397,2
27397,We would have kept it if it had fit.,27397,2
27397,The bottom of the tail is open so you can walk or use a monofin.,27397,2
27397,Would have been nice to have snaps to keep the tail in place when using a monofin.,27397,2
27398,I am very unhappy that the bracelet came with different charms then what is shown in the picture.,27398,2
27398,I really liked the way it is shown and the reason I bought it....,27398,2
27398,Disappointed!,27398,2
27398,!,27398,2
27399,"I first bought the dress according to the size chart (a size 8) but when I got it I was very disappointed because it was much too big, so I returned it and sized down (to a size 6).",27399,2
27399,"That size fit me perfectly but the mesh like parts hurt and were uncomfortable by my armpits, and I couldn't lift my arms very high.",27399,2
27399,"Also, the black part above my bust was much too high, stopping 3-4 inches above where my bra stopped.",27399,2
27399,"Unlike in the picture, this dress made me look VERY boxy and took away any look of curviness I have.",27399,2
27399,"Overall, I was uncomfortable wearing this and it just made me feel bad about myself.",27399,2
27400,The coloring has rubbed off so now it is not rose gold.,27400,2
27400,I love the style of ear ring but the only problem is that within the first day I was wearing it the color came off.,27400,2
27401,"The bras are decent quality, however, the sizing sucks.",27401,2
27401,"These should be made in different sizes, because let's face it, bras just don't work in generalized small thru XL.",27401,2
27401,I wish they fit me better.,27401,2
27402,"I ordered a 3XL since I have a chest size of 50"" and read the reviews that it would fit small, however this fits like it's only a Large.",27402,2
27403,Top wasn't big enough and the bottom was too big,27403,2
27404,The back seam ripped and fabric frayed after wearing it twice.,27404,2
27404,They need better sticking on delicate fabric.,27404,2
27405,Way too tight in the leg area.,27405,2
27406,I already have a big butt and big thighs and I just wanted a lift to really show off my curves.,27406,2
27406,But it's just so tight around my thighs and grion area.,27406,2
27406,Damn pear shape!!,27406,2
27406,!,27406,2
27407,When it arrived it was smashed down flat into the box with no other protection.,27407,2
27407,The bag does not look as nice in person as it does in the Amazon pic.,27407,2
27407,It does not hold it's shape and the fabric on it is wrinkled and seems to be separating from it's backing.,27407,2
27407,"In the pic it looks very Luz, but in reality it looks very cheap, and I am very disappointed.",27407,2
27408,"The size runs small, I am a medium on everything but this medium is like an extra small.",27408,2
27408,"Shirt is cute, but the quality of the liner is not good.",27408,2
27409,I ordered a size up and it was too small/odd fitting.,27409,2
27409,Not well proportioned for bigger chested women.,27409,2
27409,It is pretty sheer on the bottom.,27409,2
27409,Probably ok if you're slender and wear something underneath.,27409,2
27410,The sweatshirt looked like the picture except the ears were smaller.,27410,2
27410,I ordered XL and it was so small I gave it to my 10 year old niece.,27410,2
27410,She loves it.,27410,2
27411,"Super bright yellow, not subtle like the photo.",27411,2
27411,"OK quality, but the Asian version of H&M, basically.",27411,2
27412,1 wash and completely faded.,27412,2
27413,Looking for something good to say.,27413,2
27413,It made me howl with laughter.,27413,2
27413,It was like being stuffed into a size extra small wet suit.,27413,2
27414,"Nothing like the picture at all.....cheap material, worst buy ever, don't do waste your money.",27414,2
27414,Maybe it it was a plain color swimwear it wouldnt be so bag but the color looks washed out and ugly,27414,2
27415,Flimsy and broke easily,27415,2
27416,Dress Was Extremely Tight.,27416,2
27416,Way Toooo Short & You Can See Straight Through It,27416,2
27417,"Looks fantastic, but severely undersized.",27417,2
27417,"I purchased a 3XL, and this would barely register in actual size as a L. Very poor sizing, but a nice product.",27417,2
27418,Not flattering at all...,27418,2
27419,The letter U started to come off from the seam after one washing.,27419,2
27420,"Quality wasn't that great, received my visor with scratches.",27420,2
27420,Spend a little more for better quality.,27420,2
27421,"Pretty, but the sides have pockets that stick out, I mean REALLY stick out.",27421,2
27421,"Sewn differently, they would have laid flat/draped, which is what touch want with this kind of dress.",27421,2
27421,Maybe it will relax in time...,27421,2
27422,Cheaply made,27422,2
27423,The v-neck came down much lower than I thought was shown in the pictures.,27423,2
27423,Can be worn over a shirt but had hoped to wear it by itself.,27423,2
27424,way too short.,27424,2
27424,had to buy lace to make longer does not fit as in picture,27424,2
27425,Too orange...,27425,2
27425,Disappointed.,27425,2
27426,I really liked the style and support of this product.,27426,2
27426,"It fit  a bit larger than size, but that is good for toddler shoes.",27426,2
27426,"However, I would not purchase this shoe again because after there weeks of almost daily wear the Velcro strip was detaching from the fabric.",27426,2
27426,I had bought a different type if sandle by this brand last year.,27426,2
27426,I bought that same one this year.,27426,2
27426,I haven't had a problem with that shoe.,27426,2
27427,The blue paint chipped after 1 week of wearing it.,27427,2
27427,Took a blue marker to cover the chip marks.,27427,2
27428,I bought two different pairs and they are both terrible.,27428,2
27428,I don't know if they actually helped with blocking some of the sunlight or if it just gave everything a different hue.,27428,2
27428,Regardless they are made with really cheap plastic and are quite smaller than expected.,27428,2
27428,Don't waste money on these.,27428,2
27429,"Cute, but cheap.",27429,2
27429,Been wearing off and on for a couple weeks and the straps are snapping in half and the lace is falling apart.,27429,2
27429,Do not recommend.,27429,2
27430,Asian customer,27430,2
27431,These are super cute to wear a few times.,27431,2
27431,They are not the most sturdy but what makes me the most sad is that they are too small for my face and seem to bebent inwards.,27431,2
27431,Not sure if I got a smaller version but I am giving them away,27431,2
27432,This is an ok shirt.,27432,2
27432,It is not long and loose fitting like in the picture,27432,2
27433,"These were advertised as Baby BOY socks, and they are... sorta, in color.",27433,2
27433,Except the opening is lined with... lace or what appears to be some frilly lace.,27433,2
27433,"Now I'm not the type that assumes my baby's gender to be a boy (He is), nor am I to assume that he won't like lace (I don't), but as a parent, I have the right to dress my child in anything I want, regardless of how embarrassing it will be to him (I do).",27433,2
27433,"Except, lace socks, they just look weird....",27433,2
27434,Buckle broke inside of a week.,27434,2
27434,Leather band itself was nice and impressive for the price,27434,2
27435,"smaller than stated size, very pretty",27435,2
27436,Poor quality,27436,2
27437,The pink part is very much see through.,27437,2
27437,Can't find a strapless slip the fit my belly.,27437,2
27438,it wasn't a plus size...very small,27438,2
27439,"plastic and cheap, do not buy",27439,2
27440,"They shirt is really a nice looking shirt, BUT I ordered 3 different colors of this shirt.",27440,2
27440,I generally wear a 1X to 2X.,27440,2
27440,Because it was lace I wanted to make sure it fit and could have a layer underneath.,27440,2
27440,So I ordered 5X.,27440,2
27440,It should have been huge on me.,27440,2
27440,Shirt was tight.,27440,2
27440,I wish these shirts would have been true to size.,27440,2
27441,The stitching used or something it's made with is very itchy on the skin.,27441,2
27442,I typically don't place orders for products with little to no reviews.,27442,2
27442,"Based on other Versa product reviews, I thought I would try out this newer and more expensive model.",27442,2
27442,I like the sleek look of the winder and use of carbon fiber.,27442,2
27442,I was disappointed to find how cheap the product feels when I recieved it.,27442,2
27442,Additionally the logo in the front and center really ruined it for me.,27442,2
27443,I agree with most other reviewers.,27443,2
27443,This shirt is so cheap looking and took about a month to arrive.,27443,2
27443,Very disappointed.,27443,2
27443,Doesn't look like the picture at all.,27443,2
27444,Extremely small for size.,27444,2
27445,TINY!!!,27445,2
27445,!,27445,2
27446,This looked like it might be cute.,27446,2
27446,I ordered it in silver.,27446,2
27446,Unfortunately I missed the description where it says it is made of alloy.,27446,2
27446,"It does not look like silver, but a really cheap light silver color, hard to describe, just imagine what costume jewlery looks like.",27446,2
27446,I have yet to wear it since I hate the look of it.,27446,2
27446,"I have ordered cheap jewlery before that at least appeared silver in color, this piece unfortunately does not.",27446,2
27446,"I gave it 2 stars because it was included in the description, my fault for not paying attention.",27446,2
27447,the shirt is very transparent,27447,2
27448,Not able to put it on,27448,2
27449,Very thin material.,27449,2
27449,Color isn't vibrant.,27449,2
27449,Thinking of returning it.,27449,2
27450,Was really disappointed expected the $11.00 COD charge.,27450,2
27450,I never expected this.,27450,2
27450,This was way too expensive for a flimsy tank top.,27450,2
27450,The tank top is nice but too expensive for something I could have paid $20 less for.,27450,2
27451,Not impressed.,27451,2
27451,It was not the same color as the picture shows and the pattern was messed up on the butt cheek making it look wet.,27451,2
27451,"Material is super thin, so these can only be used as lounge pants.",27451,2
27452,Just purchased this for my Pre K 3 kiddo for 2016-2017 school year.,27452,2
27452,In less than a month the plastic on the strap was broken.,27452,2
27452,Cute and colorful but very poorly made.,27452,2
27453,I ordered a size 3x-they are more like a L/XL.,27453,2
27453,The color was as pictured-just WAY to small for me to wear.,27453,2
27453,And they did not have hardly any stretch.,27453,2
27453,Ended up finding a pair at Wal-Mart.,27453,2
27454,I am sending back.,27454,2
27454,"A very cute top, however, when tried on did not lay well at the neck line.",27454,2
27454,Seems as if t-shirt is not sewn correctly to chiffon top and so it bunches and creates folds.,27454,2
27454,No amount of adjusting worked.,27454,2
27455,sizes run smaller,27455,2
27456,I just recived the shoes for an event we have tonight and they have a ink stain on the front of the shoe !,27456,2
27456,!,27456,2
27456,Not happy at all with the quality of the product,27456,2
27457,My torso is a little long for this suit.,27457,2
27457,Had to give it away.,27457,2
27458,I wanted this to fit so badly but no such thing.,27458,2
27458,I bought the biggest size offered because I read it ran small and still didn't fit over my hips.,27458,2
27458,"I am 5'5"", 220 and normally wear an XL or size 16.",27458,2
27459,I ordered the 16g but ended up getting a 14g in the mail.,27459,2
27459,"The style is nice, I'm just not interested in stretching at all.",27459,2
27460,Sized way too small.,27460,2
27460,I did not like the quality as it was not nearly as good as expected.,27460,2
27461,"Looks like kids jewelry, you get what you pay for",27461,2
27462,Unfortunately the pair with the Raphael angel has several holes in both socks!,27462,2
27463,don't really like it,27463,2
27464,"I love the look of this, I have it with a green stone.",27464,2
27464,"However, when it came, it was in pieces inside the plastic packaging.",27464,2
27464,"I fixed it, but frankly it was a pain, the  links kept falling off, as I was attempting to put them back on.",27464,2
27464,Some of the links had very little to bend back in place which made it very hard to tighten.,27464,2
27464,"So far, so good, but who knows  - I'll have to wait and see.",27464,2
27464,Not happy with it.,27464,2
27465,Too small.,27465,2
27465,Make sure you order a size larger than you usually wear.,27465,2
27466,Ordered a size 9 years.,27466,2
27466,"The shirt was a 9, the pants were a 6.",27466,2
27467,I don't know if I bought them in the wrong size or what but these jeans are the size for my little sister.,27467,2
27467,She's 12 years old.,27467,2
27468,Just one time use..,27468,2
27468,Mere waste if want to reuse..,27468,2
27468,"It's like a grocery plastic bag material, very blowy",27468,2
27469,Great Pattern but the fabric is not enough to get proper coverage.,27469,2
27469,I will probably return it.,27469,2
27469,I am very disapointed.,27469,2
27470,"I saw a lot of good review for this skirt, but when I received it, I could not get it to zip up.",27470,2
27470,"It took 2 people (my boyfriend and myself) to get it zipped up, I literally had to lie down on my bed and pull as he held my skirt.",27470,2
27470,"Then once I had it on, I couldn't get it off.",27470,2
27470,It was hilarious and frustrating all at the same time.,27470,2
27470,"I loved the skirt too, the pattern was beautiful and the material was very sturdy and soft.",27470,2
27470,"Maybe I'll buy this again one day in hopes of a better zipper, but today is not that day.",27470,2
27471,I basically got a hat that was way too large.,27471,2
27471,I ordered a medium size and got one that was basically large or x large even though the tag said medium.,27471,2
27471,I ended up giving the hat away.,27471,2
27472,"Beautiful and I loved the weight of it, unfortunately it fell apart the second day I wore it.",27472,2
27473,"Nice soft material and very cute design, however it came damaged with part of application completely torn apart.",27473,2
27473,Very sad as otherwise the shirt is very nice.,27473,2
27474,wore out in 1 trip each,27474,2
27475,Dress material is good quality and the body fits nice as well as the length.,27475,2
27475,The arms have a very weird bag to them and it doesn't go off the shoulder like the model pictured.,27475,2
27475,I will never wear the dress because of it.,27475,2
27476,I really like this dress but this size is so wrong.,27476,2
27476,I ordered an XXL and I couldn't get it on.,27476,2
27476,I wear a size 12/14.,27476,2
27476,So disappointed.,27476,2
27476,"The size on the dress shows XXXL
Way to small",27476,2
27477,When I recieved this it was two sizes too small tag said 3xl and it fit like a large.,27477,2
27478,I am tall with a long torso and this suit (even though I ordered a size larger than I wear) is still too short and not comfortable.,27478,2
27478,I was disappointed with this and would NOT recommend to anyone.,27478,2
27478,I am glad I didn't spend a lot of money.,27478,2
27479,"Frames are metal, way too heavy for my preference",27479,2
27480,Like everything about it except it QUICKLY started to fall apart.,27480,2
27480,The lining behind the credit card area torn within a week.,27480,2
27480,Now muy license and credit cards don't stay put and easily fall out....not good.,27480,2
27481,"runs very small , beautiful ring but I ask for a 9 and it looks like a 5.",27481,2
27481,I had to give it away,27481,2
27482,First the good: the shirt arrived in the timeframe given and was the correct size; the logo is crisp and well done.,27482,2
27482,"Now the bad: on the first wash (not even worn yet) the shirt came out of the washing machine with a six or so inch thread that came unstitched from the top right collar areathe material hasn't separated yet but its looking like this shirt is already starting to fall apart, that is quite disappointing.",27482,2
27482,"This is most likely a manufacturing defect that slipped through quality controlnot really sure the seller should be blamed for this, but buyer beware none the less.",27482,2
27483,Too small.,27483,2
27483,Stem bent.,27483,2
27483,But cute,27483,2
27484,No support in the top but the bottoms fit.,27484,2
27485,"Way too short to be called a dress,",27485,2
27486,I bought an XL...was very disappointed in how small the cut was...body AND sleeves of the top.,27486,2
27486,"Loved the softness,",27486,2
27487,Sweater was a bit snug and that was without a dress shirt underneath.,27487,2
27488,Cheaply made.,27488,2
27488,Too tight.,27488,2
27489,"Came slightly damaged; the metal is very delicate, and the necklace is smaller than I expected.",27489,2
27489,"Still pretty though, and the glow-in-the-dark feature works better than I thought it would - very bright even though it's small.",27489,2
27489,":Review Update:

Before writing the first review, I had been super excited that the bead actually glowed in the dark - so many 'glow' products don't.",27489,2
27489,"However, I noticed a little while later that the pendant was damaged (part of the cage was bent; the metal is extremely delicate and cheaply made).",27489,2
27489,"I decided that was okay, it wasn't really noticeable.",27489,2
27489,"Then I tried to wear it, and found out that the clasp is so tiny that it's nearly impossible to re-hook.",27489,2
27489,I had to hang the pendant on a spare chain just to be able to wear it.,27489,2
27489,"I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a really nice piece of jewelry, and I probably would have sent it back but it wasn't worth the trouble to ship.",27489,2
27489,But hey...at least it glows.,27489,2
27490,Waist of money,27490,2
27491,The size chart was off.,27491,2
27491,I could not fit the size that they had for mr at all,27491,2
27492,The product fits nothing like the picture and the fabric is so thin and see through.,27492,2
27493,Finally got the jacket.,27493,2
27493,The color was suppose to be all black according to the picture but it is black and blue!,27493,2
27493,Got it for my daughter but I know she won't like it now that I seen it so guess I'll wear it!,27493,2
27494,Sizes run a bit small... material not of best quality.,27494,2
27495,Runs way small,27495,2
27496,"One of the zippers is busted , even before first trip.",27496,2
27496,Hope I hear back from this group,27496,2
27497,Does not give the support I need and it cuts the skin at the top,27497,2
27498,The quality was good but the shirt was tiny,27498,2
27499,"the chain looks cheap, the picture doesnt really show how the actual chain looks.",27499,2
27499,shipping took almost a month.,27499,2
27500,This is a great shirt if you like to iron.,27500,2
27500,The cotton construction and tailoring are such that no matter how you wash and dry it - it comes out of the dryer horribly wrinkled.,27500,2
27500,Compared to many other shirts that are all cotton and the answer must be poor construction and materials.,27500,2
27501,"While I was grateful to receive the full refund from the return of this merchandise, I was disappointed in the quality and workmanship of the merchandise.",27501,2
27502,not exactly what i was hoping for - too big,27502,2
27503,didn't like it not what I expected,27503,2
27504,"Cute, but very small.",27504,2
27504,The chain closure broke on the first wearing.,27504,2
27505,"Really cute fit, Asian size only...",27505,2
27506,Definitely not worth the price.,27506,2
27507,"I DID NOT LIKE THAT DRESS, QUALITY IS POOR, LOOKS LIKE A LONG T - SHIRT.",27507,2
27508,Fabric of cheap quality...the pant legs are way too big wide and long.,27508,2
27508,The belt is horrible...very poor quality.,27508,2
27509,Ridiculously small.,27509,2
27509,The Large is really a Small.,27509,2
27509,The fabric is really pretty though.,27509,2
27510,I was very pleased with the delivery time.,27510,2
27510,My earrings arrived way ahead of the expected arrival time.,27510,2
27510,"However,  the earrings did not look like the ones in the picture nor did they fit the way they do on the model in the picture.",27510,2
27510,They look much larger.,27510,2
27510,I had a difficult time keeping them in my ears.,27510,2
27510,I had to really squeeze and press them in my ear.,27510,2
27510,They would fall down and just dangle in my ears.,27510,2
27511,I ordered the size I take and I had to squeeze myself into it.,27511,2
27511,The quality surprised me too; not what I expected.,27511,2
27512,it is just ok,27512,2
27513,"Do not buy if you are 5,8 and over, WAY too short.",27513,2
27513,Which sucks cause super cute otherwise,27513,2
27514,"like the design, but it was too small for me :-(",27514,2
27515,"Cute, but it's kind of see thru n it's also short.",27515,2
27516,"PROS:
 Cheap!",27516,2
27516,At least in terms of similar looking bags.,27516,2
27516,"Looks great, real simple style and no blaring brand name tags/labels.",27516,2
27516,"CONS:
 Not built well.",27516,2
27516,"After a little under two weeks of use, some seams started to come apart.",27516,2
27516,The area where the zipper ends on the side of the bag came apart.,27516,2
27516,And the shoulder strap attachment.,27516,2
27516,Glad I caught it because it seems like it was only a matter of time my encased laptop would've smashed onto the ground (this thing has no real padding).,27516,2
27516,Doesn't stand on its own when you set it down.,27516,2
27516,Kind of smaller than expected actually.,27516,2
27516,"Was looking for laptop bag that had these handles, looked nice and simple and similar to this color.",27516,2
27516,All other types of suitcases/laptop bags I was looking at were at least +$100 but I decided to try this really cheap one (in comparison) as a trial run.,27516,2
27516,"Lessoned learned, you get what you pay for.",27516,2
27516,"Bottom line: If you don't wanna spend that much money and you aren't carrying anything that heavy and expensive inside, this should work for your needs.",27516,2
27516,"Otherwise, stay away.",27516,2
27517,ok,27517,2
27518,too big  one size,27518,2
27519,They run small and the material was much thinner than I expected,27519,2
27520,not good quality,27520,2
27521,Its a nice skirt.,27521,2
27521,But the seam was sowed uneven.,27521,2
27522,Only gave it a three because its 3 sizes smaller than normal.,27522,2
27522,I normally wear an 8.,27522,2
27522,My first dress I got I ordered an 8 but when it arrived their was a label on the package that said US size 6.,27522,2
27522,So I ordered a 10 and 12 both were too small so now I have to order a 12 and in ivory it isn't prime and its for my dress I am changing into  when we start swing dancing at my reception.,27522,2
27522,Hope the 14 arrives on time and that it fits.,27522,2
27522,But to order a 14 when normally an 8 isn't normal as I order a lot of dresses through Amazon and usually a small or 8 unless they say it runs small then a medium or 10.,27522,2
27522,Havent changed weight as my other dresses in 8 and small fit great.,27522,2
27523,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.,27523,2
27523,TOO THIN AND NOT USEFUL FOR DAILY USE.,27523,2
27524,"I bought this because I thought it would be a perfect travel wallet- and I could use the compartments to put money into different ""budgets"" such as food, entertainment, transportation...etc.",27524,2
27524,"The compartments won't hold much, especially in dealing with foreign currencies that require a lot of bills.",27524,2
27524,Beyond the fact that it doesn't hold very much the quality is not good.,27524,2
27524,"The faux leather is very cheap and would not hold up for long under the best of circumstances,  let alone traveling throughout Asia.",27524,2
27524,I ended up not even bringing the wallet because I knew that it wouldn't hold up and would be a headache.,27524,2
27525,Top was good bottoms all wrong....real bummer!,27525,2
27525,!,27525,2
27526,Too chunky.,27526,2
27526,Catches on everything.,27526,2
27527,Cheaply made.,27527,2
27527,"handmade metal, roughly made but nice for the price.",27527,2
27528,"When i bought it, it looked amazing.",27528,2
27528,"After a week or so of wear, the metal had completely faded and it no longer looked gold.",27528,2
27528,Now it looks like dirty cheap metal.,27528,2
27528,Oh well at least i got a weeks wear.,27528,2
27529,"The dress is a beautiful color and the collar detail is lovely, but it fits very boxy which isn't flattering at all.",27529,2
27529,I ended up returning it.,27529,2
27530,"I haven't worn them as yet, but tried them on, they fit ok, but I'm not sure I am keeping them.",27530,2
27530,The foot part fells like it's made of cardboard under the suede.,27530,2
27531,"Way to long for little kids ,unless you put gloves in your boots.",27531,2
27532,"Had to return, not the best quality and stitching was poor.",27532,2
27533,"Very small, odd fit.",27533,2
27534,Not comfortable at all.,27534,2
27535,A piece of material folded in half with space left for your arms to go thru.,27535,2
27535,Need I sat more I returned it.,27535,2
27536,arms was to big,27536,2
27537,"Nice vest, but as others described, it does run a size to small.",27537,2
27538,It's fits well but it's spandex so it looks like a halloween costume.,27538,2
27539,It came with a tear in the collar.,27539,2
27539,The picture made it seem there was more length to it then there is.,27539,2
27539,Cheaply made and pretty disappointed.,27539,2
27540,After waiting over a month for my suit it finally came in!,27540,2
27540,I was so excited... Until I went to try it on.,27540,2
27540,I ordered a medium.,27540,2
27540,"I am 5'5"" 120 lbs 32C.",27540,2
27540,The bottoms were ENTIRELY too small.,27540,2
27540,They fit like an XS And then the top.,27540,2
27540,That's a different story.,27540,2
27540,It fits ME like an XL.,27540,2
27540,I thought maybe they were just the wrong size.,27540,2
27540,Nope.,27540,2
27540,Both had tags indicated that they're Medium!,27540,2
27540,Maybe they're mislabeled?,27540,2
27540,I don't know.,27540,2
27540,But I like the top alot.,27540,2
27540,I'll probably have it altered or something.,27540,2
27540,But I don't know what I'll do about the bottoms.,27540,2
27541,"Mask was missing, foam on one side of the legs was missing.",27541,2
27541,"In saying that, if everything has been included it would have been fine.",27541,2
27541,Also medium is gigantic - I'm 5'6 and 125 lbs.,27541,2
27542,It is to big and the quality is poor.,27542,2
27542,You get what you pay for I suppose.,27542,2
27543,They were way smaller than advertised.,27543,2
27543,I need to send them back.,27543,2
27543,Also I did not realize they were canvas.,27543,2
27544,Did not come with gloves as shown on pic or alcohol pads very misleading,27544,2
27545,sent this back immediately.,27545,2
27545,Fit too small and just was not as cute as the picture.,27545,2
27545,Looked a little cheap.,27545,2
27545,Colors were pretty but thats about it.,27545,2
27546,"Looked nothing like pic, ran really small.",27546,2
27547,See through!,27547,2
27547,Have to wear something under it.,27547,2
27547,Fits comfortably.,27547,2
27547,Smooth fabric.,27547,2
27547,"Cute design, wished the quality was better.",27547,2
27548,The top is really small and the bottom is a normal small size.,27548,2
27548,The cups are very together and It fits tight.,27548,2
27548,I'm regulary and XS or a small and the top felt very tiny.,27548,2
27549,Too tight.,27549,2
27549,Not sized as expected,27549,2
27550,Ripped the first time I wore it...no leg room.,27550,2
27551,very comfortable but front ripped after a few months.,27551,2
27552,No way these should be considered plus size.,27552,2
27552,"I'm barely plus sized, usually a size 14, and these were ridiculously small.",27552,2
27552,"Soft, yes, but it doesn't matter how soft they are if they don't fit.",27552,2
27553,Too small.,27553,2
27554,to small and short in legs not crazy about it,27554,2
27555,The tank is low in the back and bust due to the length of the straps.,27555,2
27556,Runs really small,27556,2
27557,Product I received was green not black.,27557,2
27558,Great concept but the band broke....need to fix that.,27558,2
27559,"needs repair, once again, I will fix it myself",27559,2
27560,They are cute but the hair tie doesn't stay on it.,27560,2
27561,I love the design and material.,27561,2
27562,These shoes were a giant disappointment so say the least.,27562,2
27562,I expected more from the price of Geox!!!!!,27562,2
27562,"There is nothing supporting the foot bones, ball of the foot, toe box, or any ankle support for their growing little feet!!!!",27562,2
27562,I would not recommend these shoes to anyone.,27562,2
27563,Made poorly in China.,27563,2
27563,The belt is worthless.,27563,2
27563,Will not stay on.,27563,2
27563,Cheap cheap fabric.,27563,2
27564,"After I washed this for the first time, It shrunk.",27564,2
27564,"It's still cute, but I cant wear it without wearing something Underneath.",27564,2
27565,Cute colors shipped quickly but way too small to stay in nose,27565,2
27566,see through,27566,2
27567,Not the same colors as the photo.,27567,2
27567,"They're actually ugly, but comfy material so im keeping them.",27567,2
27568,Seemed like a cheap fabric.,27568,2
27568,Had minor pulls in it and it was like a fitted turtleneck.,27568,2
27568,The neck definitely was not as loose and draped like it shows in the picture and it didn't go down to thighs on me.,27568,2
27568,"I'm 5' 5"" and 130 lbs.",27568,2
27569,Bathing fits okay in the body but in the breast area wire is very firm.,27569,2
27569,"I would not recommend for women with smaller breast... its not like a ""push up""",27569,2
27570,"Very cheap material, bought the XL and it fits my 12 yr old very skinny daughter perfectly.",27570,2
27571,ordered bigger and still too small,27571,2
27572,"The size was suppose to be a 2X, but it look like it was a size  small.",27572,2
27572,the quality was nice.,27572,2
27573,"First of all, the tag is in two languages.",27573,2
27573,One is English and the other I believe is Japanese.,27573,2
27573,"The ""cotton blend"" is 65% cotton and 35% polyester.",27573,2
27573,It is hand wash only.,27573,2
27573,I wouldn't have bought it had I known that.,27573,2
27573,The pants are huge compared to the shirt and of a very rough material.,27573,2
27573,"The strings on the pants are rather long and would make a funny bow when tied, but it didn't come tied.",27573,2
27573,Even though the sizing says 3T/4T the tag says 4T with no measurements.,27573,2
27573,"If your child is between a 3 and 4, I'd get the same size I did (3T/4T).",27573,2
27573,My daughter is between 2T and 3T and it's too big on her even though she's tall.,27573,2
27573,Not worth my time and effort to try and return for what little it cost.,27573,2
27573,Hopefully she can wear it before winter.,27573,2
27573,"Remember, you get what you pay for.",27573,2
27574,Disappointed that the extra large size didn't come close to fitting.,27574,2
27574,I returned it.,27574,2
27575,"Small in sleeves, but not in the body.",27575,2
27575,I usually roll up the sleeves when I wear it.,27575,2
27575,"I don't like the feel of it, it's a bit scratchy so I usually wear a collared shirt underneath.",27575,2
27576,"Very boxy appearance, the shirt fits very very loosely around the waist.",27576,2
27576,The collar is also very large and with the top button secured there is like 3 inches between my neck and the edge of the collar.,27576,2
27576,Sleeves fit well enough.,27576,2
27577,Way too small,27577,2
27578,The color was highlighter yellow as opposed to the yellow in the picture.,27578,2
27578,Other than that it was fine.,27578,2
27579,"These are cute no doubt...but the necklace came in one loop, the lobster claw was just stuck on the chain and not attached to an end, because there was no end.",27579,2
27579,I had to cut it and add a jump ring and a new connecter because the lobster claw wouldn't close once it was opened.,27579,2
27579,"The elephants are going the wrong direction, they are attached to the back vertically instead of horizontally as they should be.",27579,2
27579,Why?,27579,2
27579,Why would you have them go on head to tail when they should be back to feet?,27579,2
27580,I ended up returning these.,27580,2
27580,"They are really cute, if only they would stay flipped up on my earlobe.",27580,2
27580,Kept twisting around and hanging down like regular earrings.,27580,2
27581,Very small.,27581,2
27581,Especially in front.,27581,2
27581,Get a size up for sure,27581,2
27582,It is very cheap looking.,27582,2
27583,Sliver Color  silver is the only thing that is good.,27583,2
27583,"Love the design but cheep, cheep, cheep.",27583,2
27583,I would send it back but it would cost me more than the top cost.,27583,2
27583,"Sorry, I was looking forward to making this part of my outfit for a special occasion coming up to soon to do anything about it.",27583,2
27584,Size large and it is extremely small.,27584,2
27584,I will have to give to my 12yr old niece.,27584,2
27585,I ordered 4 of these to give as gifts.,27585,2
27585,Two came with the elephants upside down.,27585,2
27585,I contacted seller.,27585,2
27585,Seller said they would send two new ones but i have not recieved them.,27585,2
27585,It's been about 2 weeks now.,27585,2
27585,Disappointed!,27585,2
27585,"The other two bracelets are fine,  just as expected.",27585,2
27585,I think ordering these is a gamble as to if your produce will be assembled correctly or not.,27585,2
27586,It is really warm and really long.,27586,2
27587,I like them but one of the straps is already starting to unthread in the front where it meets the front part.,27587,2
27587,I've only worn it once....,27587,2
27588,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,27588,2
27588,"Too big , different fit !",27588,2
27589,"I ordered based in the size chart, I did read reviews.",27589,2
27589,"As a 34G or sometimes 34H, I knew these were just for very light support, lounging so I was not expecting an actual support bra.",27589,2
27589,I found the description to be accurate and like that they have a three hook back closure.,27589,2
27589,The fabric is far more stretchy than I anticipated although soft to the touch.,27589,2
27589,"The back band was extremely loose, again I followed chart provided by seller, and the cup/getting area was fine, more coverage than anticipated.",27589,2
27589,As others have mentioned the padding is awkward.,27589,2
27589,"Even after adjusting and unfolding them out looked as though I had ""two thick paper plates"" (comment from partner) that are too small to cover the whole area so it looks even worse.",27589,2
27589,If the band had been tight enough I would've attempted it by taking them out but it is far too loose.,27589,2
27589,I will return and look for a brand that has slightly sturdier band.,27589,2
27589,"Might be perfect for another, just not meeting my needs.",27589,2
27589,"UPDATE:
I ordered this in a medium as a last effort - They cover (kind of) but are so stretchy that they constantly need adjustment.",27589,2
27589,I am giving them away.,27589,2
27589,I would think that two sizes smaller would have given a more secure fit but that is not the case.,27589,2
27590,it runs small.,27590,2
27591,Very heavy material.,27591,2
27591,Not comfortable and way too big.,27591,2
27592,"It's pretty, but it won't stay straight up on my neck, fold outward.",27592,2
27592,Couldn't wear it.,27592,2
27593,"The zippers on the larger pockets are plastic, not  metal.",27593,2
27593,One broke in less than 2 months.,27593,2
27594,I was unhappy with the quality of this product.,27594,2
27594,Strings hanging.,27594,2
27594,Flimsy construction.,27594,2
27594,I returned it.,27594,2
27595,Not so impressed with these undies I ordered them in the S/M and I wish they had them in a smaller size.,27595,2
27595,I am actually not that small but they are not very tight and fit just like any other pair of high waisted underwear.,27595,2
27595,I don't notice that the gel patch over my incision  helps in anyway.,27595,2
27595,Kind of disappointed for spending so much money on a mediocre product,27595,2
27596,"Cute, but broke taking it out of the packaging.",27596,2
27597,Don't like the Fabric - feels plastic an makes noises,27597,2
27598,The fit was small.,27598,2
27598,The fabric was felt cheap and it is not soft.,27598,2
27598,"The buttons are a nice concept for feeding, but I think it's easier to buy button up pajamas.",27598,2
27598,I tried it on once and I never wore it again.,27598,2
27598,Maybe I'll try it in the summer.,27598,2
27599,just okay,27599,2
27600,Super tiny and I'm not even that big.,27600,2
27600,And i ordered the largest size.,27600,2
27600,Also it fit more like lingerie then a swim suit.,27600,2
27600,Very very very skimpy and revealing.,27600,2
27600,Just in case that's not the look you're going for,27600,2
27601,I've had other carhartt pants usually a size 32.,27601,2
27601,Those fit pretty good but we're starting to feel a little tight after washing.,27601,2
27601,So I ordered these in a 33 and before washing them they are tighter than my 32s?!?,27601,2
27601,"Worst part is, because I already ripped off the tags assuming they would fit fine like my other ones I can't return them...",27601,2
27602,This is by far the cheapest hat I have ever seen.,27602,2
27602,Seriously I didn't even know it was possible to make something this bad but it is made in CHINA which I didn't know or I wouldn't have bought it.,27602,2
27602,The embroidery is nice though.,27602,2
27602,I'm not sure if it worth returning since it only cost $9.00,27602,2
27603,Runs 2 sizes small but pretty,27603,2
27604,Looks great but very bad in quality,27604,2
27605,"After less than a year of use, the wallet's end seams finally gave out and now I have a hole at the end which allows my cash to be seen and pulled through.",27605,2
27605,I have had other wallets and they have lasted a lot longer.,27605,2
27605,"Moreover, while it is a thin wallet, it's quality feels a bit flimsy.",27605,2
27605,I am now need to purchase a new wallet.,27605,2
27605,"On a plus side, I haven't had to swap it out immediately as the card holders have held.",27605,2
27606,"One size may fit most, but an unusually large head like mine can't squeeze into this.",27606,2
27606,Decent seeming hat otherwise.,27606,2
27607,"Beware, Amazon Buyers...",27607,2
27607,This item is NOT LEATHER.,27607,2
27607,"It bears the authentic Luxottica trademark, but is made of embossed plastic like all lower-priced competitor items.",27607,2
27607,A rare example of false advertising on Amazon.,27607,2
27608,Plan on ordering 3 sizes up to get a somewhat fit like shown on the Itty bitty model.,27608,2
27608,(The front is a lot shorter than picture shows.,27608,2
27608,The material reminds me of worn out cheap bed sheets!,27608,2
27608,Enough said....good luck!,27608,2
27609,The information/size scale on the site was a incorrect.,27609,2
27609,It's way too big for me.,27609,2
27609,I will have to return and get correct size.,27609,2
27610,Size seems to be made for a child,27610,2
27611,Not quite like the picture and looks more like a briefcase than anything but  not worth the time to send it back.,27611,2
27612,the strings snapped after I wore it once... Not worth the money.,27612,2
27613,I would like to return it.,27613,2
27614,"It felt like a good quality swim suit, the material was nice.",27614,2
27614,"However, the cups were WAY too small and I could tell they were the second I opened the package.",27614,2
27614,"I ordered a size up just in case of this, and they were still way too small.",27614,2
27615,Didn't know they come by size it is a wonderful board I didn't get the right size a large will be better for me I still tried put it since I need it to flat my stomach not working,27615,2
27616,This came today.,27616,2
27616,Geez.,27616,2
27616,The model is a short child.,27616,2
27616,The scarf is not that long.,27616,2
27616,"I am 5' 6"".",27616,2
27616,Once I do what I do as in this picture the end of the scarf is sitting on my chest.,27616,2
27616,"It is very thin, like a sock puppet material, tad thicker.",27616,2
27616,That's about all this is.,27616,2
27616,"So, if you are short and want a long scarf that comes down to your hips, this is your scarf, (and you don't care that it is NOT warm and you need a hat with it.)",27616,2
27616,"If you are an adult and want a long winter scarf, look elsewhere.",27616,2
27616,I'm keeping the scarf only because my great-grandsons are not over 4 feet yet.,27616,2
27616,Once of them will like it.,27616,2
27616,"The wind blows right through this thing, so you need to wear a warm hat too.",27616,2
27616,"Okay, off to find a scarf.",27616,2
27616,"Oh, but it did come really, really earlier than they said it would so that was good I guess.",27616,2
27617,Way too small and unclear how to return... but I am new to buying online so ...,27617,2
27618,Too big and IPhone 7 doesn't fit neatly,27618,2
27619,"The back has 2 very small vecro spots to hold the costume in place, they constantly came apart.",27619,2
27619,The appliques had to be sewn/tacked down as they weren't secured to the costume very well.,27619,2
27619,"While the costume was very short in the torso (size large for 5'10"" guy) the belt was too big and kept coming undone-the Velcro on the belt was not enough to hold the weight of the belt.",27619,2
27619,Too much money for bad quality.,27619,2
27620,Sizes are running very small,27620,2
27621,"The dress is lovely, however the under dress is not long enough and easily rides up making the dress see through as the over dress layer is a mesh with the sequins and beads.",27621,2
27622,It looked really cute in the picture but the material was really thin and it was really tight.,27622,2
27622,Wasn't comfortable!,27622,2
27623,"I've waited to post a rating, have had this belt for a few months, as I've worn it the color is already rubbing off the edges of the belt.",27623,2
27623,The leather seems not to have been dyed very deeply.,27623,2
27623,"The belt is supple, which is good, I purchased a medium, which was too big for me,  I'm 5'6"" 145lb waist about 28/29"".",27623,2
27623,Difficult to cut extra off.,27623,2
27624,Decent jeans.,27624,2
27624,"Certainly highwaisted, but the holes fall way below the knee and that's just not what I'm looking for.",27624,2
27625,The color has faded very quickly leaving it a yellow/gold color; no more pretty rainbow.,27625,2
27625,Otherwise the earring itself is okay.,27625,2
27625,The ball stays in place.,27625,2
27626,"It looks cute in picture, but the arm and leg portions are way too long, and the torso section is not proportional to the rest of the suit.",27626,2
27627,They don't look like the picture.,27627,2
27627,Not cute.,27627,2
27628,way too small for a pack of 100's,27628,2
27629,Very pretty I wore it and it broke,27629,2
27630,Really cute but it turned my skin green,27630,2
27631,The elastic for the button on the top broke when I was putting them on.,27631,2
27631,I had to repair it myself.,27631,2
27631,"Really pretty cheaply made, yet what do you expect for the price!",27631,2
27631,!,27631,2
27632,It is too small.,27632,2
27632,"I am size Xs and S, so based on reviews I bought a M size and it is very small.",27632,2
27633,It is really cute and nice material.,27633,2
27633,I own 20 bikinis all size medium so i ordered this one in medium and it is way too small.,27633,2
27633,I don't even think a large would fit me.,27633,2
27633,"Im 5'3""  117 pounds.",27633,2
27633,and wear 34c,27633,2
27634,The middle piece in the back was crooked.,27634,2
27635,Faded and the tiger is way too yellow.,27635,2
27636,Cheaply made,27636,2
27637,Much smaller than I expected.,27637,2
27638,Smaller than expected and broke after a week,27638,2
27639,Material is more like a loose spandex.,27639,2
27639,The graphic is play but not as good as I thought.honestly probably won't wear it.,27639,2
27639,But I guess you get what you paid for.,27639,2
27640,"being as they are made in china, they are too tight and not as long as advertised.",27640,2
27641,"The pair that arrived were nice, soft material, and fit comfortably.",27641,2
27641,"However, I am 5'3"" with a short torso, the crouch was too long.",27641,2
27641,"If you are tall, or have a long torso, these pants might fit you well.",27641,2
27641,I would have loved them if they were low rise with a shorter crouch area.,27641,2
27641,I am returning them...bummer.,27641,2
27642,"They fit well, bit are not black but rather greyish, looking almost faded.",27642,2
27642,"They are too expensive to look that bad, but i needed them.",27642,2
27643,Recommend save up for a better one.,27643,2
27644,we purchased an xxl coat and it actually was a medium.,27644,2
27644,"checked the tag for size and it was marked xxl, put the fit was medium",27644,2
27645,Small on the waste large on the top :(,27645,2
27646,These are NOT the size listed in the description- they are bigger than the size listed.,27646,2
27646,"Other than that, they are a beautiful piece of jewelry.",27646,2
27646,I really wish they had worked out.,27646,2
27647,This fit large.,27647,2
27647,Looks okay on but nothing fashionable.,27647,2
27648,"Prior to ordering this, I was wearing my spanx for support and shaping after my C. A friend highly recommend this so I gave it a try and it did not give me enough support as my Spanx.",27648,2
27648,"Based on other reviews, I ordered A size down (s/m) and it was still too big.",27648,2
27648,It's unfortunate that this was the smallest size.,27648,2
27648,It felt like regular underwear to me.,27648,2
27648,The position of the silicone patch was too high for me so I needed to constantly pull it down.,27648,2
27648,I tried wearing this for a week hoping I would learn to love it but I ended up switching back to my Spanx.,27648,2
27648,Spanx gave me the tight support while also shaping me back to pre-pregnancy size.,27648,2
27649,"The design is great, but manufacturing and materials aren't the bomb.",27649,2
27649,"First, the phone bumpers cracked when I inserted the phone and continued to crack and craze over the course of a couple weeks until no longer able to hold the phone.",27649,2
27649,"The magnet backing that is supposed to hold the phone in the wallet isn't strong enough--if you use the wristlet and let go of the wallet, sometimes the magnet doesn't hold and the phone falls out of the wallet.",27649,2
27649,This is the second wallet purchased.,27649,2
27649,The first model had a magnetic closure and was inadequate holding all my crap.,27649,2
27649,This model has a greater capacity and the snap closure works a lot better.,27649,2
27649,I would have given 4 stars if the bumper plastic wasn't brittle.,27649,2
27649,I'd also be willing to pay more for more durable materials.,27649,2
27650,I like the sweater.,27650,2
27650,But it's to small.,27650,2
27650,I have to leave it open.,27650,2
27651,Fits good and very comfortable but not durable.,27651,2
27651,One of the seams split open after one day of use.,27651,2
27652,Does not look like the ones I buy at Saks Fifth Ave...,27652,2
27653,Product was made well just too small for a large and kept rolling up,27653,2
27654,"if the product says ""Pair"" generally that means two.",27654,2
27654,However i only received one earring.,27654,2
27654,The description needs to be changed.,27654,2
27655,Not the greatest quality!,27655,2
27655,Pretty light duty,27655,2
27656,Could not open my watches back.,27656,2
27656,"Try on three watches,guess I am a jeweler.",27656,2
27656,"Using this tool on other things, not a total waste..",27656,2
27657,"It's very pretty, but the fit ,and  zipper is strange",27657,2
27658,"I ordered a small for my wife who is 5' 3"".",27658,2
27658,"It was too big, but the most annoying problem was that the rob came without a belt.",27658,2
27658,I am returning it and will order an extra small and see if they include a belt with it this time.,27658,2
27659,These are very large sunglasses.,27659,2
27659,Bigger then expected and they do not fit my face at all.,27659,2
27659,I can't even make them look good if I wanted.,27659,2
27659,So disappointed as the information and pictures made them seem smaller then they are.,27659,2
27660,CheapLy made,27660,2
27661,"pants took a very long time to arrive, but i was prepared for the wait, but what came were these tiny leggings for someone who weighs 90 pounds and they are screen printed.",27661,2
27661,"cheap pants yes, but you get what you pay for.",27661,2
27661,I will be finding someone much small than me to give them to,27661,2
27662,This did not fit very well at all so I wound up returning it after trying it on.,27662,2
27663,"The product looks ok, but the quality of the fabric sucks!",27663,2
27663,I imagine it will be destroyed if I try machine washing it.,27663,2
27664,What can I say..... if you have any breast or behind at all this suit will not fit.,27664,2
27664,If I had neither of those it would have fit.,27664,2
27664,On the upside the quality looked to be good.,27664,2
27664,Had to send back.,27664,2
27665,"the chain look is deceiving, once you have it in your hands it is toooooooo thin.",27665,2
27666,Too flimsy of material an runs small.,27666,2
27666,Will never buy it again.,27666,2
27666,Sorry,27666,2
27667,It's ok...,27667,2
27667,"It feels like it's made of lead, so I don't want to touch it or have it touch my skin.",27667,2
27667,The gem on top is just plastic and isn't even glued on straight.,27667,2
27667,"The chain is a cheap ""dog tag"" chain.",27667,2
27667,It's not feminine at all.,27667,2
27667,The product picture is the best quality of work that they could show and it's still pretty bad.,27667,2
27667,"If your a doctor who fan, it's OK, but not something I would actually wear.",27667,2
27668,"Good quality T-shirt, but print was way off center.",27668,2
27669,Returned the product because it fit very small.,27669,2
27670,Too small xlarge is likea 10,27670,2
27671,very form fitting.,27671,2
27671,wasn't expecting that.,27671,2
27672,"Liked it, just wish red was more on the red side and not rust colored.",27672,2
27672,Also very thin and see-through.,27672,2
27673,I suppose it would fit the average height woman okay.,27673,2
27673,I am 6'0 and the waist line was not in the right place for me.,27673,2
27673,"The fabric was terrible, more specifically cheap, like the stuff they make children's pajamas out of and you wonder if it is flammable.",27673,2
27673,You can do better than this dress.,27673,2
27674,The rings are extremely small/short.,27674,2
27674,The end of the ring didn't even make it to the inside of my nose.,27674,2
27674,"The product quality was good and I loved how thin the ring is, but unfortunately they don't fit at all.",27674,2
27674,I would not recommend purchasing these unless you have a smaller nose.,27674,2
27675,Very cheaply made.,27675,2
27675,Short for 5'6.,27675,2
27675,Disappointed.,27675,2
27676,Pretty  and nice size but gold was chipped on cross and silver was peeking through that spot.,27676,2
27677,This did not come with a chain but only the pendant and earrings.,27677,2
27677,Pretty but doesn't look like its gold plated.,27677,2
27678,The design is cute.,27678,2
27678,Sizing is way off---too small!!!,27678,2
27678,Quality of material was poor.,27678,2
27678,"It's suppose to be a sweatshirt, not a sweater; however the material was stiff.",27678,2
27679,They run way too small.,27679,2
27679,Very thin material,27679,2
27680,Ran small,27680,2
27681,the price was good the quality is not that much,27681,2
27682,Wrinkled permanently.,27682,2
27683,It is too small in the cup size.,27683,2
27684,Poor fit.,27684,2
27684,Material is too thick,27684,2
27685,Very thin..it is like a shirt..very disappointed .,27685,2
27685,Only good thing is that it came early,27685,2
27686,"it was very cute, but it was so small on my 11 month old that the snaps wouldn't stay snapped as he walked/moved.",27686,2
27687,Too small,27687,2
27688,Not as sturdy as it could be.,27688,2
27688,Zipper went out after some wearing.,27688,2
27689,I was very disappointed with the materials.,27689,2
27689,"It is very much like a child's purse, cheaply made and flimsy.",27689,2
27689,"Also, it has two zippers, but only one compartment.",27689,2
27690,"The needles for this piercing kit were indeed sanitized and packaged correctly, but the jewelry on the other hand was cheaply made and not even anodized, it was mearly painted and caused black dye to rub off and infect my ear.",27690,2
27690,"I would recommend this item for the needles only, but the jewelry is trash.",27690,2
27691,The pants are too short and theTracksuit does not live up to what was represented.,27691,2
27691,This was made for a teenager not a woman.,27691,2
27692,A bit to small.,27692,2
27693,Loved the tanks when they arrived.,27693,2
27693,"However, DO NOT DRY THEM!",27693,2
27693,I washed them and now they are 2 sizes smaller.,27693,2
27693,Super disappointed.,27693,2
27694,"It ran a size smal, so I ordered up.",27694,2
27694,But it still ran small in the waist and large in the  chest.,27694,2
27694,I'm  5'7 tall 36D.,27694,2
27694,"It has odd shaped breast build-in padding, which I wouldn't have needed anyway.",27694,2
27694,"It made me look like I had big, wide hips.",27694,2
27695,"Although the dress is very pretty, I ordered my size (10 US) and it was a bit too large, The main thing is though, the fabric..I should have looked more closely.",27695,2
27695,60% polyamide.,27695,2
27695,What is that?,27695,2
27695,"Yes, it is soft and flowy, but it's nothing anywhere near natural.",27695,2
27695,"Feels very wierd, like some kind of woven acrylic or plastic, certainly not something you could wear on a hot day.",27695,2
27695,I was afraid it would melt if I wore it out.,27695,2
27696,The earrings are cute but wore them once and both posts fell out.,27696,2
27696,Unfortunately wore them after the return period had expired so they are a loss.,27696,2
27697,not very pretty,27697,2
27698,I bought size Large because my windbreaker from LL Bean is a large.,27698,2
27698,"The Nautica jacket was too tight on me, and also, the sleeves were way too long for a person who is 5'4"" and 190 pounds.",27698,2
27698,I shipped it back to the Seller and i am waiting for a refund.,27698,2
27699,"These are very loud, and glossy glossy fabric, 1000% polyester",27699,2
27700,The shirt smelled like it was made inside of a discount tire shop.,27700,2
27700,I gave it away to a teenager instead of keeping it.,27700,2
27700,She said she liked it.,27700,2
27701,Really cute Jacket but doesn't wash well and is about 4 sizes smaller than they say.,27701,2
27701,I ordered 2X and I usually wear 16/18.,27701,2
27701,My arms fit in well but jacket won't come near to closing in the front.,27701,2
27701,"Advice...if you are a 16 or more, don't order.",27701,2
27702,"it's not what I was expecting looks different from the pic, it is gold thread not a lace applique",27702,2
27703,Draw string came out on my second time I wore them,27703,2
27704,"It is too short, I'm not a tall person but the suit did not properly fit height wise.",27704,2
27704,It was like it was made for someone less than 5 feet tall,27704,2
27705,"The material of the shirt was too thin, and it was crinkly cheap material.",27705,2
27705,I usually wear a size small-medium US so I bought a large to be safe and it was still too small.,27705,2
27705,"Even after ironing it the material remained wrinkled, so it was not very flattering to wear.",27705,2
27705,"I tried to wear another shirt to cover a majority of the tshirt so that the cat collar would only be visible, but the collar was so paper thin and crinkled it didn't look right.",27705,2
27705,I've only worn it once and I'm not sure if I would wear it again sadly :( .,27705,2
27706,"These look nice for a little bit, but they are brittle and fall apart easy.",27706,2
27706,All within a month.,27706,2
27706,"And the braclet not only broke where the moon is,  but tarnished within a few months",27706,2
27707,"If it were the right size, it may have been beautiful.",27707,2
27707,"However, the crocheted part doesn't to mold with my thin torso so it left a gap.",27707,2
27707,The color is as pictured and it looks great in the picture.,27707,2
27708,super cute on.,27708,2
27708,but  i wear a small in teens sizes and i got a medium and it fits like an xs in teens.,27708,2
27708,i wish i had gotten the XL it would have fit better.,27708,2
27709,"The fabric and feel of these pants is dissapointing; sort of plastic-y almost, very thin and cheap-feeling.",27709,2
27709,"I purchased because of the added bonus of zippered pockets, but I wouldn't buy again.",27709,2
27709,"Purchased the medium, which fit smaller than expected, more like a small (wearer is normally 32x32, so a medium is usally appropriate).",27709,2
27710,These shoes are poorly constructed and I don't expect them to last more that one summer.,27710,2
27710,"Would not recommend, and will not order another Nike downshifter series again",27710,2
27711,"I ordered a small, but received the dress and it's slightly big.",27711,2
27711,I have to have it altered.,27711,2
27712,The zipper broke,27712,2
27713,Chain is very light duty.,27713,2
27713,"""If"" you have children, and one grabs is while you are wearing it.",27713,2
27713,Th e chain will break.,27713,2
27713,Not the quality I expected.,27713,2
27714,Used it to make a jellyfish and it broke in less than an hour.,27714,2
27714,Sucks.,27714,2
27715,I wear a an XL to 2XL(rarely).,27715,2
27715,"This is supposedly 3XL, but my arms almost bust the seams, and I couldn't even button it, it was too small.",27715,2
27715,I do not care what country this garment hails from.,27715,2
27715,"There is a standard in clothing sizes that is adopted, pretty much, world wide.",27715,2
27715,This fit like a slim Large.,27715,2
27716,Top is too short but quality good for price,27716,2
27717,Only one half of the lights on the case worked but it's bright,27717,2
27718,"extremely cheap fabric, and very large.",27718,2
27718,I returned it.,27718,2
27719,This wasn't the size that I ordered.,27719,2
27719,"I ordered 2X, but I received XL.",27719,2
27719,"It was supposed to be for Christmas family pics, where everyone wore red.",27719,2
27720,The dress was too small.,27720,2
27720,Smaller than the regular xxl size.,27720,2
27721,"When it first arrived, it was a snug fit, but seemed to work.",27721,2
27721,"A week or so after I got it, it developed a crack at the bottom.",27721,2
27721,"I superglued it, and life went on.",27721,2
27721,"Another week, another crack, superglue to the rescue again, another crack and again superglue.",27721,2
27721,"However, now, the case isnt' fitting as snugly, and the wireless charging tabs arn't touching correctly, so it is no longer charging with the

While the back looks ok, it does not fit well, cracks easily, and for me, eventually stopped working.",27721,2
27721,"In the end, I guess I got what I paid for, as this was quite inexpensive.",27721,2
27721,"However, I can not recommend it and would not buy it again.",27721,2
27722,Too small and it is see through,27722,2
27723,Not as vibrant in color as the pic but the top being a large fits about a size b cub.. Not my 38DD size cup .,27723,2
27723,Soooo the top will be given away as a gift but the bottoms are cute and can be paired with any top.,27723,2
27724,"I liked the bracelet a lot, nice big stones, very pretty.",27724,2
27724,Unfortunately it broke after about two weeks.,27724,2
27724,"I have pretty small wrists, for a guy, and i was careful when taking the bracelet on & off.",27724,2
27724,What a bummer!,27724,2
27725,I purchased a pair of these sunglasses for my wife.,27725,2
27725,She actually liked them!,27725,2
27725,"Lo and behold, we were at the beach recently and as she was removing them from her face and she just felt one arm come off in her hand.",27725,2
27725,She was in absolute shock!!,27725,2
27725,We did not expect them to last forever but certainly longer than 6 months.,27725,2
27725,"She may have used them four or five times during this period, perhaps a bit more.",27725,2
27725,We consider this to be absolutely disgraceful as these sunglasses are not exactly cheap!,27725,2
27725,In my opinion they should be replaced by the manufacturer free of cost!,27725,2
27726,It says one size but it was too small ill be returning it.,27726,2
27727,Very thin,27727,2
27728,way small,27728,2
27729,"Not really clear, more of a hazy white.",27729,2
27729,"They're also a bit long and since they are soft and flexible, you can't really cut them down, without miss shaping them, like I planned to.",27729,2
27730,It's a cute shirt and all but the size runs way too small.,27730,2
27730,Order a size or maybe even 2 so you get a shirt that fits.,27730,2
27731,More of a child than adult.,27731,2
27731,Wouldn't fit my 9 year old.,27731,2
27732,Not what I expected... Blah,27732,2
27733,"This shirt is somewhat large .the color wasn't what I expected, kind lighter than what it seems in the picture I'm kind disappointed",27733,2
27734,This was great for 8 months.,27734,2
27734,"Right at 8 months of use, it stopped working.",27734,2
27734,$140 is a lot to pay for 8 months of watch winding.,27734,2
27734,And it has only a 30 day return policy.,27734,2
27734,It should work longer than it did.,27734,2
27734,I'm disappointed to say the least.,27734,2
27735,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but I am disapointed",27735,2
27736,NO.... Just no.,27736,2
27736,This is NOT how this hat looks at all.,27736,2
27736,It is NOT burgundy with ivory flower and soft green petals.,27736,2
27736,"It is actually bright harsh red, with bright white flower and florescent green leaves.",27736,2
27736,The one I received is actually really horrendously ugly.,27736,2
27736,I would never use it or even give it as a gift.,27736,2
27736,I'm really disappointed.,27736,2
27736,"I still awarded two stars because if you need a hat simply for ""warmth"" it will do the trick at a low price.",27736,2
27736,"DO NOT BUY THIS HAT just because it is ""cute"" though... because it really is NOT.",27736,2
27737,The straps on the shoulders were placed so that they are a raised loop.,27737,2
27737,Strange.,27737,2
27737,I thought that they would lay flat.,27737,2
27738,I would love to return it~~~,27738,2
27739,Love the color but run smaller than the solid colors!,27739,2
27739,!,27739,2
27740,Skirt is extremely pretty but sizing is way off.,27740,2
27741,"Eh, nothing special.",27741,2
27741,ended up sending back.,27741,2
27742,I am very Disappointed in this product.,27742,2
27742,2x is very loose.,27742,2
27742,It does no justice for an individual without a big backside.,27742,2
27742,The lining around the cheek area ripped above and below on the right side.,27742,2
27742,Material is extremely sensitive.,27742,2
27743,to tight**feel to small,27743,2
27744,Runs a little small and it very sheer for it to be made from cotton!,27744,2
27745,Funny that I bought this suit three times.,27745,2
27745,"I am 5'9"" and 170.",27745,2
27745,I typically wear medium tops and a size 10-12 bottoms.,27745,2
27745,I got the large and two XL.,27745,2
27745,The XL in the grey and pink fit perfectly.,27745,2
27745,The large in black and white was too tight and the XL in the black and white had such insanely long straps I figured it must have been a deformed cut.,27745,2
27745,I sent both the black and white suits back.,27745,2
27746,Might as well put 2 quarters into a machine and get one from there.,27746,2
27747,The one size thing is wrong.,27747,2
27747,The tunic is beautiful though.,27747,2
27747,Wish it was a better fit as I thought it would be loose and comfortable.,27747,2
27748,It looks rather classy till you see how big it is and how flimsy the strap is.,27748,2
27748,"On top of that I couldn't get the lighter to work (and yes, I know how to use and fill butane lighters).",27748,2
27748,The only redeeming side is the watch works just fine.,27748,2
27749,Really cheap material and wayyyyyy too big.,27749,2
27749,I ordered a small and they're definitely as big as a large in other scrub brands.,27749,2
27749,Don't waste your money.,27749,2
27750,Horrible material and about 3 sizes smaller than what I purchased,27750,2
27751,Way too big.,27751,2
27752,too bumpy,27752,2
27753,I was originally going to give this 3 stars.,27753,2
27753,"It is, as advertised, a permanent press skirt with pockets and an elastic waist.",27753,2
27753,"However, the pockets are a little small and the material is just OK.",27753,2
27753,"However, after I washed it, the elastic got twisted and now I don't know if I'll be able to wear it again.",27753,2
27753,Bummer.,27753,2
27754,"Disappointed, came with 2 tears, a red stain & the Button s must rreattached as the threads are coming undone.",27754,2
27754,Haven't even worn it yet.,27754,2
27755,"Did not fit my ears, and were not warm, fell off easy.",27755,2
27755,Would not buy again.,27755,2
27755,They need thicker material and ear mitts that cover smaller ears or smaller sizes,27755,2
27756,"The merchandise wasn't size I expected, too small, too tight",27756,2
27757,Thought they were ok but one broke in the bag!,27757,2
27757,Not worth sending back.,27757,2
27758,The top portion of the dress is a different material than the bottom portion.,27758,2
27758,"They don't really go well together, but it would make a nice cheap-looking dress for some type of not fancy party.",27758,2
27759,Makes me look like sponge bob square pants.,27759,2
27760,The stitching was horrible on this wallet.,27760,2
27760,Felt like this was a flawed product but they were trying to sell it without saying this.,27760,2
27760,Returned it.,27760,2
27761,It was missing a side light.,27761,2
27761,"And I ordered it late, so it arrived on Christmas Eve, so I gave the present to my grandson anyway, because it was too late to do anything about it.",27761,2
27762,To Little,27762,2
27763,I like the tie but it was too small,27763,2
27764,"love the shoe, just ordered the men's size and not the womens...can't find a womens 9 anywhere",27764,2
27765,The cut was kind of cute but still not good enough since the giant draping triangle shape always succeeds to make your chest look really bad.,27765,2
27765,"Even with a belt it was too ugly and too much fabric under my arms, so I returned it.",27765,2
27765,The fabric wasn't great.,27765,2
27766,"I love the brand, feel and fit of these leggings.",27766,2
27766,I did however have to return this particular pair because I did not like the graphics on them.,27766,2
27766,It's hard to really see in the picture but it just looked to busy when you put them on.,27766,2
27767,It is small.,27767,2
27767,But fabric is good,27767,2
27768,Tigers not as expected after washing the tigers begin to peel off got 3 wears out of it before it was trashed overpriced !,27768,2
27768,!!,27768,2
27768,!,27768,2
27769,These ties are decent for the price but don't get them if you're in a hurry to receive them.,27769,2
27770,This watch has no water resistance.,27770,2
27770,I bought a wooden Topwell with a round case and it holds up to moisture much better.,27770,2
27770,Also does not look as good as the round in person.,27770,2
27771,"While I was putting on the suit, I could hear the stitching ripping.",27771,2
27771,Was shocked because the bathing suit bottoms are big on me.,27771,2
27772,"A lot smaller than imagined, difficult to put in.",27772,2
27773,returned.,27773,2
27773,Very thin and much shorter then pictured.,27773,2
27773,Was pleased with the quick return policy,27773,2
27774,The top was very awkward on me.,27774,2
27774,I could not get a good fit at all.,27774,2
27774,"The material was great though, very soft.",27774,2
27774,"The bottom half of the ""gown"" was very pretty, BUT it is very short and snug.",27774,2
27775,To clingy,27775,2
27776,Poor quality...,27776,2
27776,The nude is a very ugly brown it's not transparent at all,27776,2
27777,Too big,27777,2
27778,the bottom fit ok but the top was too small and uncomfortable.,27778,2
27779,"Looks great and good quality, but made too small.",27779,2
27779,There's too many under-sized socks out there and this is one of them.,27779,2
27779,"I don't get it, but wasn't worth the price.",27779,2
27779,May fit men's shoe size 7 and under.,27779,2
27780,"Tried to get this for my boyfriend, but after he washed it (even in cold water and whatnot) it still shrunk.",27780,2
27780,I even bought a size XL instead of the usual L and it still shrunk so much it would fit me.,27780,2
27780,Disappointed :(((,27780,2
27781,split in half when taking it off,27781,2
27782,Not as slouchy as advertised.,27782,2
27782,:/,27782,2
27783,This is literally nothing like i imagined it would be.,27783,2
27783,The harness is much thinner than advertised.,27783,2
27783,"Be aware that it comes in a basically ""do-it-yourself"" assembly kit when I feel as though it were advertised otherwise.",27783,2
27783,"I still haven't figured out how to make it look like the photograph, and if I can't get a friend to figure it out, then I will likely be returning it.",27783,2
27784,This is just way to small!!,27784,2
27784,No stretch what so ever.,27784,2
27784,I am a size 8-10 in almost everything and the Large in this was just too small.,27784,2
27784,May be the equivalent of a 4-6.,27784,2
27784,"I have size C-D breast cup, and this suit had so much spillage.",27784,2
27784,I would not buy again.,27784,2
27785,"Not only is the coat more than 2 sizes too small, the quality is not up to standards as one of the button fell off as I removed it from the packaging and the other buttons are not expected to stay on the jacket.",27785,2
27785,"When ordering, pay special attention to return policy.",27785,2
27785,"When I requested a return, It was recommended to me to keep the coat that I cannot wear and was offered only about 30% of what I paid.",27785,2
27786,"Great quality , shirt looks amazing except it is a woman's shirt and not made for men.",27786,2
27787,"very uncomfortable, would only wear if have undershirt.",27787,2
27787,Also once you dry it ALL THE LOGOS shrink disproportionate to the shirt.,27787,2
27787,so you look like a walking representation of how black holes warp physical matter and space around it.,27787,2
27787,"with all the fabric crinkled, and pulled around the logos",27787,2
27788,Bad textile quality,27788,2
27789,The construction feels cheap and my daughter complained that the lenses made her eyes hurt.,27789,2
27789,"For the price I shouldn't have been surprised, but we won't be purchasing any more of these.",27789,2
27789,We usually buy at the sporting goods store as that seems to be the only place to find kids sunglasses not plastered with some cartoon character.,27789,2
27789,Those usually run $15-20 which is a lot for sunglasses that will likely get lost or broken.,27789,2
27789,Guess we'll be sticking with those though.,27789,2
27790,I'm a bit disappointed with how deceiving the picture is.,27790,2
27790,"The purse is completely flat, it is more like an envelope than a purse really.",27790,2
27791,It is not navy blue it is royal blue.,27791,2
27791,Was really disappointed when i saw if was not the right color.,27791,2
27792,not at all what I expected.,27792,2
27792,If you like to IRON than this is a shirt for you.,27792,2
27792,"Oh and make sure when you wear it that you go some place where you just stand, because it wrinkles like crazy :(",27792,2
27793,This just didn't fit properly.,27793,2
27793,I ordered a XXXL first and the top (cups) was extremely large.,27793,2
27793,"I reordered a XXL and the tops was still too large, but the body was just a bit too snug.",27793,2
27793,This just wasn't a good fit for me.,27793,2
27794,"I'm a size medium in most everything, but ordered a large because I wanted it oversized.",27794,2
27794,I cannot even get this on due to the ridiculously narrow shoulders.,27794,2
27794,It's so small I thought at first I was sent the wrong item.,27794,2
27794,I'll not be ordering this brand again and this will be going in the donation bin.,27794,2
27795,material cheap-like.,27795,2
27795,Not a lot of shape- just hangs there....doesn't look anything like picture.,27795,2
27796,They are to small,27796,2
27797,"As other reviewers mentions, the color come off easily.",27797,2
27797,I should have washed it before wearing.,27797,2
27797,"Other than the color coming offf, it is good.",27797,2
27798,"Looks way better in the picture , material is heavy and feels bleh, I would keep shopping ....",27798,2
27799,Order came unwrapped without tags,27799,2
27800,They look nice but are flimsy so much so that you have to be careful as the front will fold under as you walk.,27800,2
27800,I almost fell in a parking lot when this happened and I tripped over them.,27800,2
27801,"Nice quality, just too small",27801,2
27802,Letters faded fast and I didn't even wear it out too much.,27802,2
27803,Smaller on top than the measurements would indicate.,27803,2
27803,It may work for my daughter.,27803,2
27804,beautiful dress but sown poorly and doesn't fit,27804,2
27805,Slightly too small.,27805,2
27805,Size isn't accurate,27805,2
27806,too short / uncomfortable in the waist.,27806,2
27807,"I gave this 2 stars because it is a really nice looking purse, but not for anything heavier than maybe a wallet.",27807,2
27807,"I used it for little over 1 week to go to work with my ultrabook laptop which is less than 4lbs, my wallet, and a planner.",27807,2
27807,"Already one of the straps were coming apart at the seams, see pictures.",27807,2
27807,"I was really disappointed since this purse was perfect, but alas the quality of the straps is not reinforced enough, which is just not acceptable since many women carry a lot of items in their purses!",27807,2
27808,this item is very small.,27808,2
27808,I ordered an XL which is bigger than what I normally wear and it is so small a child can wear it.,27808,2
27808,"I was very disappointed, I have contacted the seller for a resolution.",27808,2
27809,"I really wanted to like these but they unfortunately don't fit my ears, will update as I keep going up sizes.",27809,2
27810,Not happy with the blouse.,27810,2
27810,I wear an extra large and it doesn't fit in shoulders.,27810,2
27811,"Very thin, not very flexible.",27811,2
27811,"Uncomfortable to wear because the edges sort of dig into my wrists, but it doesn't look too bad.",27811,2
27812,This hat arrived with the fibers already coming loose on the underside of the brim where they appeared to have been glued.,27812,2
27812,It snags on everything and it continued to unravel.,27812,2
27812,The brim has some sort of wire mesh imbedded that caused it to have little zigs and zags in it.,27812,2
27812,The only way to fix this (that I found) was to form the hat to a curved surface (sofa) to get the brim mostly even.,27812,2
27812,This won't matter if you use the hat for work only.,27812,2
27812,Other hats without the mesh were much better at retaining their shape.,27812,2
27812,I won't buy another exc as a work only hat.,27812,2
27813,"I want to love this wallet, but the fact that the Mythosaur logo was chipped like crazy when it was delivered is annoying.",27813,2
27813,"It came double wrapped and in an envelope, so it wasn't from the shipping.",27813,2
27813,There are a ton of pockets on it though for numerous cards and a nice large one in the middle for cash.,27813,2
27813,3 stars lost for the 3 large chips.,27813,2
27814,I think these shorts are cute but the elastic is a thick ribbed cotton that feels like I will stretch out quickly.,27814,2
27814,The biggest problem is that they are SUPER small.,27814,2
27814,I have always been a size large and I think I ordered an XL just so they can grow with me.,27814,2
27814,I cannot even get them past my knees.,27814,2
27814,Yikes.,27814,2
27814,The tag did say the correct size-- perhaps they were mislabeled?,27814,2
27815,I found that the Belly Bandit was too stiff to be able to sit down while wearing.,27815,2
27815,I breast feed my little one and couldn't keep it on while feeding.,27815,2
27815,It's too much work taking it on and off with the frequency of sitting.,27815,2
27815,It does provide support when standing but couldn't make it work for me.,27815,2
27815,The return policy isn't great.,27815,2
27815,"I bought it ahead of time and by the time I got to try it, I was unable to return it.",27815,2
27815,I wouldn't recommend this product.,27815,2
27816,Disappointed - the picture led me to believe I would get the set.,27816,2
27816,I should have known it was too good to be true!,27816,2
27817,Fit was ok....howver the dress was different from what is on the website.,27817,2
27818,"The socks look good, but developed holes after a single use and wash.",27818,2
27819,"Top is too small,
Bottom is too big -_-  .",27819,2
27819,Really disappointed.,27819,2
27820,The color on this dress says baige the color is actually a peach color.,27820,2
27820,I ordered the dress for my sisters wedding and the colors for the wedding are baige and browns.,27820,2
27820,I absolutely love the style and the dress fits perfectly but peach is not a color I can wear.,27820,2
27820,Just suggesting maybe you guys chance the name of the color to peach.,27820,2
27821,"I'm 5"" 115lb 32c bust - normally wear a size S/XS in women .",27821,2
27821,"I ordered a S & This top is Way too small, it fits my 9 year old perfectly who wears a 10/12 in kids tops.",27821,2
27821,Very disappointed but state same she now has a new top.,27821,2
27822,Was dissatisfied with this purchase.,27822,2
27822,Pretty color.,27822,2
27822,Lining was very short.,27822,2
27822,Never worn it anywhere.,27822,2
27823,"They run small and they only lasted a hour at the waterpark, the cement tore them up.",27823,2
27824,"I don't know who they are kidding but I ordered a size 20 and that is 2 sizes bigger then what I wear because I read the reviews, and let me tell you I still could not get this on!",27824,2
27825,Don't care for the shape and the cvs is much too large,27825,2
27826,Not sure if I like them in person.,27826,2
27826,They seemed rose or light pink online but are definitely bubblegum pink and look/ feel like knock offs.,27826,2
27826,There are no interior tags like saying size or brand  even cleaning directions.,27826,2
27826,runs a lil big.,27826,2
27827,Too long and awkward,27827,2
27828,It fits oddly in the shoulders,27828,2
27829,"I like them, but they are not authentic Michael Kors sandals.",27829,2
27829,The strap on the sandals there holes were cracked.,27829,2
27829,They weren't line up straight.,27829,2
27829,It was made very cheap.,27829,2
27829,"I was very disappointed especially knowing it was ""suppose"" to be a Michael Kors brand.",27829,2
27830,It's darker than the image posted.,27830,2
27830,"I wanted a very soft, light chambray shirt, and this was rigid and darker.",27830,2
27830,"Very Canadian tuxedo, not soft washed semi-denim shirt.",27830,2
27830,"Too slim and tight,I had to wear a T-shirt under it to let the shirt opened unbuttoned.",27830,2
27830,Overall semi satesfied.,27830,2
27831,returned,27831,2
27832,I had so much problems with this product.,27832,2
27832,Ordered 2 different colours grey and light grey and ended up with 2 of the same colour.,27832,2
27832,The material is okay and i ordered an s size but it is too big.,27832,2
27833,Had to by shoe stretchers.,27833,2
27834,Odd fit,27834,2
27835,The top was great but the bottoms look like they're made for a small child.,27835,2
27836,Only order for a size 8 little girl.,27836,2
27836,Price & quality good tho.,27836,2
27836,These were one size fits most or a large.,27836,2
27836,They were like $2 from China.,27836,2
27836,Took forever to get.,27836,2
27836,If you have a little girl...Order these.,27836,2
27836,Drawstring too.,27836,2
27837,Cute.,27837,2
27837,"Made poorly and tangles often, requiring you to remove the necklace to sort it out multiple times a day.",27837,2
27838,Does not fit me well.,27838,2
27839,"It said it came with a wrist strap which I was excited about, but instead I got a plug in stylus pen that I can't use because the lg g vista 2 comes with a built in stylus.",27839,2
27839,That stylus is no longer accessible because of the case shape.,27839,2
27839,Besides that I love the color and design and it allows me to carry my cards.,27839,2
27840,"I bought the ""Tiffany blue"" for my brother's wedding color theme.",27840,2
27840,"When I got the ties, they weren't Tiffany blue at all.",27840,2
27840,It seemed much darker.,27840,2
27840,Also the zipper tie feature was  pain to work.,27840,2
27841,The zipper on this tie started having problems even though I have worn this tie only a handful of times.,27841,2
27841,You get what you pay.,27841,2
27842,doesn't look like picture.,27842,2
27842,shrunk after one wash.  i did not like the material.,27842,2
27843,"This is one horrible fit, it's thick and so hard.",27843,2
27843,"Putting this underneath my dress and it showed so bad, tried using a tight under garment to flatten it and bend it but that still didn't work.",27843,2
27843,"If you purchase this item make sure you wear it with a very tight girdle so it don't show, I won't but this again.",27843,2
27843,Everyone have their own opinion and this is mine.,27843,2
27843,"I wouldn't but, reason why it don't work it shows exactly where it stops and you see the print of the item.",27843,2
27843,Even after putting a real tight girdle on it still showed and it was very uncomfortable.,27843,2
27844,Heavy on the bridge of my nose!,27844,2
27844,Leaves huge marks!,27844,2
27845,This is cheaply made for the price I paid.,27845,2
27845,"Additionally, the product photo is a misrepresentation of what is actually being sold.",27845,2
27845,"I selected this trident because the product photo shows the middle tine being taller than the other two, but the trident I received had all 3 tines the same height.",27845,2
27845,"If I would have had more time, I would have returned this.",27845,2
27845,"Ultimately, it did the job, but I didn't receive what I paid for.",27845,2
27845,I could have purchased one like I received for half the price I paid.,27845,2
27845,Very dissatisfied.,27845,2
27846,I wear a 34DDD bra and I got the 3XL size 10-12.,27846,2
27846,"The cups were far too small, but the (non-adjustable) strap was much too loose and sliding way up my back after two seconds of wearing it, so I don't think going up to size 12-14 would've helped much.",27846,2
27846,The cups were molded a bit pointily but not insanely noticeable and I probably would have still worn it if it fit.,27846,2
27846,"Besides the fit it was a beautiful swimsuit, vibrant colors, looks just like the picture, and seems to be fairly decent quality fabric.",27846,2
27846,If you have good luck with your fit you'll find yourself with a very nice swimsuit.,27846,2
27847,"I ordered a Large since I typically wear a medium, and it fit like a small.",27847,2
27847,It was too tight around my chest and didn't sit right for what appears to be a flowy shirt.,27847,2
27847,I would recommend ordering 2 sizes larger if you have a chest at all.,27847,2
27847,It's also more see through than it appears in the pictures so you'll have to wear something underneath.,27847,2
27847,"Price is good, fabric seems ok quality.",27847,2
27848,Not true to size at all.,27848,2
27848,But super long for size.,27848,2
27848,I think must have been a factory second or fail on the production line,27848,2
27849,I believe it must be an Asian size they mentioned order a size larger than you normally would order but I think this is about two sizes too small .,27849,2
27849,If you're Tiny Dancer but you just fine if you ordinant extra-large .,27849,2
27850,It's made rather straight.,27850,2
27850,"If you're already a curvy person with a waist that's smaller in the middle, this may not be for you.",27850,2
27851,"I thought I was going to love this shirt, but after trying it on, the designers left no room for a bra; not even a strapless one.",27851,2
27851,The fit was too loose and the underarm area sagged a bit.,27851,2
27851,"If I were to get a smaller size, the neck would not fit.",27851,2
27851,"The material is slightly transparent, so this is more of a swim suit cover up than a shirt I'd wear out.",27851,2
27852,This ring was not worth the price and I was very disappointed.,27852,2
27852,"I feel this ring was not up to the typical Pandora standards, the stones were not sparkly at all.",27852,2
27852,I sent it back.,27852,2
27853,"Love the texture of these socks, but they do not have a top band around the thigh to keep them in place.",27853,2
27853,These are constantly rolling down in the middle of a routine.,27853,2
27854,the material it was not what I was expecting.,27854,2
27854,Top lace a bit cheap looking and the bottom stretchy thin material.,27854,2
27855,ok,27855,2
27856,Ordered two sizes up for fit and it's still way too small.,27856,2
27856,Causes crazy bad bra strap bulge.,27856,2
27856,"The legs are also way too tight, and my legs are by far not big.",27856,2
27856,Did lift my butt up nicely once I cut the wires off the top.,27856,2
27856,Basically just made it into a little boy short and it's okay.,27856,2
27856,"Also it shows through a lot of clothes, but that can be fixed with tights.",27856,2
27857,"Dress is cute but clearly the size chart was way off, it was about 2 sizes too small.",27857,2
27857,"Instead of returning it, the company refunded 60% and let me keep it.",27857,2
27857,I will be donating the dress!,27857,2
27858,"I got it today and it's a really cute bracelet, but when I went to put it on the clasp broke.",27858,2
27858,Not really surprised considering how much I paid for it,27858,2
27859,The strap broke after wearing it twice.,27859,2
27860,"too thin over my legs (and I don't have such fat legs)
and they roll down to below the knee.",27860,2
27860,hard to get on.,27860,2
27860,and after one wash they got linty,27860,2
27861,I bought this as a gift.,27861,2
27861,The color of the actual shirt is way brighter & it seemed really smaller (i ordered a small but it was more like an extra small),27861,2
27862,Cute...but WAYYYYYYYYY to small for my 15-year old son!,27862,2
27863,It's beautiful in the picture.,27863,2
27863,No support at all and is a little itchy.,27863,2
27863,Returning.,27863,2
27864,Returned.,27864,2
27864,"Too small, and flimsy.",27864,2
27865,Not AT ALL oversized.,27865,2
27866,"They came quickly which was a plus, and looked very much like the picture.",27866,2
27866,I did not like the quality of the lenses due to the fact the style is a flat pair of glasses the lenses seemed to bend where they were attached causing divots.,27866,2
27866,I returned the glasses same day.,27866,2
27867,"Collar sits right about against your neck, which was very uncomfortable to me.",27867,2
27867,"The style and fit was very awkward, which makes me think this style works better on thinner fabrics.",27867,2
27867,"That all being said, the quality is good and the color is beautiful.",27867,2
27867,I wish this would've worked out.,27867,2
27868,This wasn't really worth it.,27868,2
27868,"It fit the ear awkwardly and is made of soft metal, so that it broke if too much force was used to reshape it.",27868,2
27868,Disappointing.,27868,2
27869,Concept is nice.,27869,2
27869,Execution of design not so much.,27869,2
27869,Too poofy in the wrong places and exceptionally long.,27869,2
27869,Wide through the waste.,27869,2
27870,I returned these as they were not true to size.,27870,2
27870,They ran large.,27870,2
27871,Way too small for your package.,27871,2
27872,Good looking purse.,27872,2
27872,Good quality however very small inside and hard to get into.,27872,2
27872,"Also, when full snaps would not stay shut and all I had in there was my wallet and lipstick in small zipper pouch.",27872,2
27872,If it had been bigger would have kept it,27872,2
27873,I really wanted this tank to be amazing and was let down.,27873,2
27873,I ordered two sizes not knowing which would fit properly.,27873,2
27873,I have a large chest 46 DD.,27873,2
27873,"The 2x fit snug which was fine, I like my tanks form fitting.",27873,2
27873,"The issue was the length, it hit just under my belly button, which is not long enough for me.",27873,2
27873,I was looking for a tank to cover my hips.,27873,2
27873,I also got the 3x which was looser but the length was the same.,27873,2
27873,I'm not a tall woman (5'7)so I'm confused on how these could be so short when other reviews reported them being super long.,27873,2
27873,Such a bummer.,27873,2
27874,It's a great shirt for those who are large chested.,27874,2
27874,"If you are, the shirt looks unflattering and smooshes your chest.",27874,2
27875,I ordered these for my niece.,27875,2
27875,"When they arrived in the mail, only the pants were in the box.",27875,2
27876,"The color is beautiful, but the material is horrible.",27876,2
27876,It is the material that is used to line a dress.,27876,2
27876,Cheap material,27876,2
27877,Somewhat large and doesn't look like the picture,27877,2
27878,Not at all small and cute like the picture.,27878,2
27878,Mine looked like a yellow cotton ball inside the bulb..,27878,2
27879,sleeves are to small,27879,2
27880,Buy the larger size runs small.,27880,2
27881,"the all blue with white stripes and faux laced shoes had a chemical smell that wouldn't come out even after washing in the washer, spraying with febreze, and leaving stuffed with dryer sheets overnight.",27881,2
27881,the smell took over the whole house and just wasn't safe for the baby.,27881,2
27881,"the shoes were cute, fit right, and in good condition otherwise, but the smell wasn't safe for the baby so we tossed them.",27881,2
27882,"Cute, but WAY too small",27882,2
27883,Material seems a little cheap.,27883,2
27884,These are very cute and you wouldn't know they were fake unless you looked really closely.,27884,2
27884,"But the post on them is a 16g, and I had to stretch my lobes to get them to fit.",27884,2
27884,"If your piercings are just big enough to fit regular earrings, these will not fit.",27884,2
27884,In the photo you can see the size of the post compared to regular earrings.,27884,2
27884,It doesn't look like much until you're trying to shove it into your ear.,27884,2
27885,Definitely not for me.,27885,2
27885,Very thing framed girls might look good in this.,27885,2
27885,The top was WAY too high up.,27885,2
27885,and the sleeves were kinda weird.,27885,2
27885,too short.,27885,2
27885,And i didn't like the material.,27885,2
27885,But it wasn't bad quality and the packaging was really nice...,27885,2
27886,Doesn't fit,27886,2
27887,too small like for a doll :(:(,27887,2
27888,"I was half way through only the second trip I ever took this on (only as a carry on, never checked it) and the zipper broke.",27888,2
27888,"I would have tried to return it, but I was in Europe and had to get a bag to replace it so I couldn't bring it home.",27888,2
27889,pocket already got hole,27889,2
27890,The large top fits like a medium,27890,2
27891,Too tight in the shoulders.,27891,2
27891,Returned.,27891,2
27892,does not work for long torso,27892,2
27893,Very thin material.,27893,2
27893,High waisted and bigger than expected.,27893,2
27894,"It fits ok, but not flattering.",27894,2
27894,I thought that because it was baggy in stomach area that it would camouflage but it doesnt.,27894,2
27894,It's very thin material and doesn't hide your stomach fat well.,27894,2
27895,Cheap looking,27895,2
27896,The necklace came with most of the beads off.,27896,2
27896,I put them on with my jewelry repair kit.,27896,2
27896,The medal attachments were not tightened.,27896,2
27896,"I hate to keep sending things back, it is inconvenient.",27896,2
27896,I can't recommend  this one.,27896,2
27896,Necklace is pretty and looks more expensive than it is.,27896,2
27897,If you want a T that clings to those arm muscles and shoes a little too much upper arm - get this shirt!,27897,2
27897,"For everyone else who likes regular/decent length tshirts, skip it.",27897,2
27898,This is going back.,27898,2
27899,ok,27899,2
27900,I really like the design and quality but I can't get past the overwhelming chemical smell.,27900,2
27901,The pants that I was wearing for work all day was 44 X 30.,27901,2
27901,When got home tried these on.,27901,2
27901,Could not even get the button close enough on the waist to fasten.,27901,2
27901,The length of the pant leg almost covered my foot.,27901,2
27901,Pants were marked 44 X 30!,27901,2
27901,And do not know how ended up with these.,27901,2
27901,Was looking for the cargo pants.,27901,2
27901,The pants did seem to fit in thighs and hips but can not say for sure as was not able to get buttoned to bend and squat.,27901,2
27901,Needed for my work.,27901,2
27901,Was first pair of Carhartt pants I had tried.,27901,2
27902,Sold it to a much smaller coworker.,27902,2
27902,Cute though.,27902,2
27903,"Its a nice shirt, well made and nice material.",27903,2
27903,It was however really tiny.,27903,2
27903,I ordered the XL and its literally a medium or a small.,27903,2
27903,"I thought perhaps I accidentally ordered a youth size, but alas.",27903,2
27904,this bag was awful.,27904,2
27904,it smelled weird I sent it back,27904,2
27905,"This is totally NOT what I expected  I just got it and I hate the bottom the top is ok, took me a while to figure it out but it's ok I guess.",27905,2
27906,Very little padding.,27906,2
27906,Very firm.,27906,2
27906,"A lot of arch support, but will hurt your feet if you have a flat foot.",27906,2
27906,Quality is not good.,27906,2
27906,Loosing upper fabric layer at some places after a few times of wear.,27906,2
27907,I love this skirt but it is far too small for what they say it is.,27907,2
27907,I had to return in.,27907,2
27908,"I liked this top - it is decently made for the price, but it is too small.",27908,2
27908,I ordered an XL and i usually wear a medium top.,27908,2
27908,I just wanted a really loose  summer top - I can't leave the house in this.,27908,2
27909,"If I didn't have daughters that liked it, I would have sent it back",27909,2
27910,Very small and tight the XL is really M,27910,2
27911,"I chose based on my waist size, as it says, and got the 7x.",27911,2
27911,"Next time I will listen to my gut, which told me to go a bit smaller, because the 7x is to big.",27911,2
27911,"I have an enormous chest (all natural) and actually got this to help support my back, as well.",27911,2
27911,It's not tight  enough on the furthest hook in,27911,2
27912,I like the product but my zipper broke after only wearing it twice,27912,2
27913,It was too short not long enough.,27913,2
27913,When you wash it it shrink a little,27913,2
27914,"The shirt was beautiful but I wouldn't recommend buying it, you can't bend you're arms because of the gem stitches are soooooo tight tight where the elbows bend, not even tolerable and I have very thin arms.",27914,2
27914,Just going to cut the sleeves off n use it for a junk shirt,27914,2
27915,I purchased these shirts to go under blouses for work.,27915,2
27915,I didn't have particularly high expectations given the price and was adequately satisfied.,27915,2
27915,The tank tops are almost see-thru thin and the straps are thin.,27915,2
27915,They fit the bill for shirts to wear under other shirts but I would never purchase these to wear on their own.,27915,2
27915,"For example, I couldn't wear this tank top solo under a cardigan...for fear that you could see everything underneath.",27915,2
27915,OK purchase for what I needed them for.,27915,2
27916,"I love the Carhartt , some haw this particular  doesn't fit will .",27916,2
27916,I looking to purchases more on the deferent brand thanks your costumer JLOPES,27916,2
27917,The two stars is for the shiping because it came way early.ok so the material is nice it does not look cheap but im 5.3 ft 100 lb and a 32b i ordered a medium and im very disapointed the bottom is really tight so if someone bigger than mr says that it fit like a glove trust me its a lie cause im really small guys ok now the top part the only problem is thag i don't have anough boobs so its a little big.im not going to return it because it has potential so see of someone can adjust it better.hoped my review helped.,27917,2
27918,Looks cute in the picture way to short for me to wear and the fabric looks different may look cuter on other people but did not work for me.,27918,2
27919,Bought these for my tendinitis.,27919,2
27919,Wore them for a few months during cycling and walking to/from the car while letting my foot heal.,27919,2
27919,"After two months, took them with me on a trip to DC and my tendinitis flared up pretty badly after just one day of walking around.",27919,2
27919,"Also, don't expect to wear them with Toms or Converse.",27919,2
27919,They won't fit.,27919,2
27920,It ran extremely large,27920,2
27921,Expected something not quite as large.,27921,2
27921,bad to wrinkle also,27921,2
27922,"Watch strap feels good and looks good too, BUT it stains the wrist everyday with a brownish tinge.... Wouldn't buy one or recommend",27922,2
27923,I don't fit.,27923,2
27924,There is no support.,27924,2
27924,It is super flimsy.,27924,2
27925,xl size is very small,27925,2
27926,"Size was fine, but it looked cheap.",27926,2
27926,Which I know it wasn't a big purchase.,27926,2
27927,I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and i love these types of bracelets so i figured i would combine the two and purchase this.,27927,2
27927,"First off, it is made a little on the large side.",27927,2
27927,I have small wrists so it is way to big for me.,27927,2
27927,I am going to try to take an end apart and adjust it myself or have my mom do it for me because she is the jewelry lady of our family.,27927,2
27927,I should have just had her make me one like this but i took a gamble and bought this one instead.,27927,2
27927,It is cute overall at first when taking it out of the packaging.,27927,2
27927,I wore it one day for about an hour just to pick my daughter up from school and then back home and it has already lost a piece of it.,27927,2
27927,The little piece between the two owls feet that connect them apparently fell off somewhere and it's now gone.,27927,2
27927,I am going to have to see if my mom or me can also fix that too somehow so that it's wearable instead of having two pieces hanging off of it.,27927,2
27927,Overall i am pretty disappointed in this purchase.,27927,2
27927,I won't be buying another one from them which sucks because there was one other one I was considering buying for my mom after I checked out the quality of this one.,27927,2
27927,"It is also a little off center with all the different pieces, which bothers me a little bit because I am OCD.",27927,2
27927,the braided pieces are also a little longer than the rest of the pieces so it makes it sit kind of weird.,27927,2
27927,I think if we take it apart and trim them down a little bit it might be ok.,27927,2
27927,The fact that I have to repair it after only having it for less than a week should speak volumes about the quality of this product though.,27927,2
27927,"I definitely would have to say don't waste your money, buy the stuff at a craft store and make your own.",27927,2
27927,I promise it will come out much better quality.,27927,2
27928,"It first confused me, but then I realized, its screws into your ears and each part screws apart, they are really difficult to put in.",27928,2
27928,Also mine fell out throughout the day then finally I lost them.,27928,2
27929,Took way too long to come and did not adequately cover my plus-sized derrire.,27929,2
27929,My attempt to pull them up to my waistline in the back resulted in some holes in the seams.,27929,2
27929,I don't wear them.,27929,2
27929,Update:  After reading my review the seller refunded my money in full.,27929,2
27929,"Potential buyers should be aware that these leggings should have been marketed as tights or hosiery, not leggings.",27929,2
27929,"As they are priced in the stocking/tight range, anyway,  buyer expectation would be better managed.",27929,2
27930,Fit small and did not wash well.,27930,2
27931,returned.,27931,2
27931,Fit strangely and a bit snug in arms and neckline.,27931,2
27932,Shirt seems decent quality.,27932,2
27932,"However, then it barely reaches the middle of my chest.",27932,2
27932,Did not find it very attractive.,27932,2
27932,Have to return,27932,2
27933,"I thought this would be a great shirt to wear around and to some Red Sox games, but the shirt is made of the same fabric as exercise shirts, so I was a little disappointed.",27933,2
27934,"The shoe is cute, but it hurts my toes.",27934,2
27934,The toe box seems way too small.,27934,2
27934,"I ordered an 8.5 and returned them, and then re-ordered a 9 and would return them also but for the $11 it takes to send them back, I'll see if I can sell them to a friend or turn it in for a donation somewhere.",27934,2
27935,A really nice suit.,27935,2
27935,The material isn't too thin but it was too small,27935,2
27936,It definitely runs very small.,27936,2
27936,I would say it's junior sizes.,27936,2
27936,if you are an A cup it might fit you.,27936,2
27937,Caused my friend to have a rash.,27937,2
27938,horrible.... only looks good on walls.,27938,2
27938,on your skin its to light and runny.,27938,2
27938,it leaves big red stain on your skin to!,27938,2
27938,don't buy,27938,2
27939,dress is short like in the picture but coloring is right on,27939,2
27940,Sadly.,27940,2
27940,I just had to return these.,27940,2
27940,I was so excited to get these in the mail.,27940,2
27940,I would not stop talking about them.,27940,2
27940,I was even going to order another pair.,27940,2
27940,When I got them I noticed that the material was thick.,27940,2
27940,SUPER THICK.,27940,2
27940,& I also noticed how small they were.,27940,2
27940,I wear a size small when it comes to Victoria's Secret yoga pants.,27940,2
27940,"But I noticed the reviews saying ""Go a size up"".",27940,2
27940,So that's what I did.,27940,2
27940,Ordered a Medium.,27940,2
27940,WAYYY TO SMALL!,27940,2
27940,I went to try them on & they ripped in the crotch area.,27940,2
27940,That's a real confidence booster.,27940,2
27940,The sad thing is is i'm 23.,27940,2
27940,"5' 5"".",27940,2
27940,138 pounds.,27940,2
27940,"""Average size"" as the doctors say.",27940,2
27940,These should of fit.,27940,2
27940,Sad day :(,27940,2
27941,i had to extend the sides,27941,2
27942,"Cute belt , but unfortunately it is starting to come apart.",27942,2
27942,Had and worn exactly 1 week,27942,2
27943,"The middle ""buttons"" were sewn too closely together so the shirt doesn't have the same upside down triangle neckhole as in the picture.",27943,2
27943,Instead my shirt's neckhole looks like a small square.,27943,2
27943,Not as cute at all.,27943,2
27944,Poor quality T-shirt for what I paid.,27944,2
27944,Runs small,27944,2
27945,Too big for me.,27945,2
27945,I am a size 00 prior to pregnancy.,27945,2
27945,Ne an XS size for petites.,27945,2
27946,Way to small and couldn't return so they gave me a 10% credit on product,27946,2
27947,Looks nothing like I imagined.,27947,2
27947,Or how they display it.,27947,2
27947,Once I tried it on it made me look like a beach wale and left waaaaaay too much of me exposed that I was not expecting.,27947,2
27948,Watch itself is cute.,27948,2
27948,Seems like it would hold up to some wear and tear.,27948,2
27948,I'm planning on replacing the band.,27948,2
27948,Watch band is as cheaply made as it gets.,27948,2
27948,I'm not convinced that the band will last past a couple days of wear and I'd hate to lose the watch.,27948,2
27949,Definitely not an xl.,27949,2
27949,The top doesn't fit at all.,27949,2
27949,"Also, came with 2 buttons missing.",27949,2
27949,For the price though what else would be expected.,27949,2
27950,"I received this dress in a timely manner,When I reviews other people's comments they said it's as true to size.",27950,2
27950,I ordered a size 16 and it did not fit.,27950,2
27950,I should have ordered 2 sizes larger.,27950,2
27950,I will send this Beautiful dress back for another size.,27950,2
27951,These are a nice shoe but the colour is wrong.,27951,2
27951,Really purple and not as shown in the picture,27951,2
27952,The cup size is far too small.,27952,2
27953,"See-through material, buttons do not actually button... Sizing is accurate",27953,2
27954,The bag arrived yesterday but has such a strong chemical odor that it can't be used unless the odor can be eliminated.,27954,2
27954,It can't go in the washing machine because there seems to be a piece of cardboard in the bottom between two pieces of vinyl.,27954,2
27954,"If the chemical smell can be eliminated, it's a nice size.",27954,2
27954,I bought it not for a beach bag but to use to hold knitting and sewing supplies.,27954,2
27954,"The way it is, it can't be used because everything would pick up the odor.",27954,2
27954,"This has happened before with another produce I purchased made in China, and it's the same very strong chemical odor, not the normal odor of vinyl.",27954,2
27954,"I couldn't get rid of the odor in the other item, a purse.",27954,2
27954,and had to throw the purse away but not before it ruined my wallet and eye glass case.,27954,2
27954,The odor even got on the money in the wallet.,27954,2
27954,I would not recommend this product unless the chemical smell doesn't matter to you.,27954,2
27955,Looks beautiful on the picture not as great in person.,27955,2
27955,Two stones fell off the rim in less than a week.,27955,2
27955,Get what u pay for I guess,27955,2
27956,cheap,27956,2
27957,I love the design of this.,27957,2
27957,"But my first case broke within a month... the design was fading, the magnetic strap fell off and you cannot take a picture with the flash because the case partially blocks the flash and causes the color to distort.",27957,2
27957,So I returned the item and the company was quick to respond and very friendly.,27957,2
27957,They replaced the case free of charge.,27957,2
27957,But the new case also broke within a month with pretty much the same problems.,27957,2
27957,I figured there was no point in returning it again so I just used it for a couple more months until where the case folds completely ripped.,27957,2
27957,It was cute for the short time it lasted!,27957,2
27958,Dress fit just right.,27958,2
27958,Beautiful dress.,27958,2
27958,The dress actually made me look smaller in size.,27958,2
27958,The only reason why I gave it a poor rating was due to the fact that my dress had a few runs in it.,27958,2
27958,I couldn't  wear this dress to the wedding I was attended that evening.,27958,2
27958,I had to go and buy a dress last minute from a another store an hour before the wedding started.,27958,2
27958,Just thankful Amazon reimbursed my money back.,27958,2
27959,This came and it was so cute.,27959,2
27959,But these overalls smelled soo bad!!!!!,27959,2
27959,The outfit smelled like s*** .,27959,2
27959,i will never let my daughter  wear it.,27959,2
27959,its not even the color i  expected it 2 be.,27959,2
27959,i pick light blue and got dark  .,27959,2
27959,i got it for my daughter  so she can wear it for her 1st  bday .,27959,2
27959,i  rather smell trash then this smell any day.,27959,2
27960,The bottoms fit well but the top hung on me.,27960,2
27960,My boyfriend said I sort of looked like a kangaroo.,27960,2
27960,lol  I think I'm pretty proportionate and average.,27960,2
27960,"at 5'4"".",27960,2
27960,135 lbs and usually wear a medium or a size 5/6...,27960,2
27960,"If you could order in two different sizes, I could've made it work and the suit is cute but not sold as it is with both being the same size.",27960,2
27961,The black blocking on the side is heavy and makes the head phones tug on the opposite end.,27961,2
27961,I wouldn't buy this again but you get what you pay for.,27961,2
27961,"""It's cheap""",27961,2
27962,Fits great but the material is incredibly irritating,27962,2
27963,This is plastic through and through.,27963,2
27963,The two-tone frame is painted silver--and not painted very well.,27963,2
27963,The chain is bright silver-toned and this doesn't match the antique look of the rest of the cameo.,27963,2
27963,I have a gun metal-colored chain and I'm going to switch it out.,27963,2
27963,Maybe that will help.,27963,2
27963,The picture color is dull and cartoonish.,27963,2
27963,Save your money and buy it when it hits the dollar store.,27963,2
27964,The numbers are too small.,27964,2
27964,Very disappointed,27964,2
27965,The shoulder strap was missing and the name plate is on crooked.,27965,2
27966,"too small, stitched oddly.",27966,2
27966,"love the print and the feel of the material, just not made very well.",27966,2
27967,ok for kids,27967,2
27968,The ropes are not looking good at all,27968,2
27969,Had fun with them but hard to speak when wearing.,27969,2
27969,Gold plating doesn't last long .Not bad for a weekend fun,27969,2
27970,"Very thin, even on the bottom.",27970,2
27970,Have to find the right shoe/pant combo to wear with these.,27970,2
27970,Took a long time to arrive.,27970,2
27971,These pants certainly are not loose fitting.,27971,2
27971,Very poor representation by Carhartt.,27971,2
27972,The reason for two stars is only because I do like the way it looks and it did look nice on my Martian Notifier watch.,27972,2
27972,"Unfortunately within one day, the clasp on the watch stopped clicking together, and eventually fell apart.",27972,2
27972,I do not recommend buying this band at all.,27972,2
27973,The bows keep falling of but the print is cute,27973,2
27974,Too all not true to size,27974,2
27975,Very uncomfortable after an hour!!!,27975,2
27975,!,27975,2
27976,I ordered this for a friend's birthday.,27976,2
27976,I 'm glad it only cost a couple of dollars.,27976,2
27976,"I was disappointed in the picture, but the chain is beautiful.",27976,2
27976,My friend did not get this for her birthday I was too disappointed to give it to her.,27976,2
27976,It looks better in the picture than it does in the hand.,27976,2
27977,sturdy glasses but the flowers are extremely delicate they are almost play dough type material you have to be careful with them flowers will fall easy,27977,2
27978,"The material is like a wierd plastic feeling, i don't even know how yo explain it but not what i was expecting",27978,2
27979,It's not the type of shirt I expected.,27979,2
27979,I thought it was going to be more of a cotton baseball tee but it is a very stretchy material.,27979,2
27979,Returning it,27979,2
27980,The fit is off.,27980,2
27980,The large fits more like a small/medium.,27980,2
27981,Fit was very tight,27981,2
27982,Thin and cheaply made.,27982,2
27982,"It looks OK, just not going to last a long time.",27982,2
27983,To big for small size,27983,2
27984,Nothing like the picture and description.,27984,2
27984,Feels very cheap.,27984,2
27985,I ordered a extra large not a 3X large.,27985,2
27986,The neck hole is super small!,27986,2
27986,The model shows the draping shoulder and my head barely fit through the hole.,27986,2
27986,It's also tighter than I imagined.,27986,2
27986,But the material is nice and sheer.,27986,2
27987,dress is beautiful quality but much smaller than the stated size!,27987,2
27988,Does not look well made.,27988,2
27988,Some of the stitches seem to be coming loose.,27988,2
27989,fragile,27989,2
27990,"Item is very cute, but I ordered a Large and the top is very small and not true to size.",27990,2
27990,Disappointed.,27990,2
27991,I bought this purse to carry inside my briefcase to go to lunch or wherever while at work.,27991,2
27991,"I would not call this a ""Smarphone wallet.""",27991,2
27991,This is a small purse/clutch (about the size of a folded in half piece of standard-size paper) with a compartment in it (as many purses have) that can store your smartphone.,27991,2
27991,"It is relatively light, so it would still serve my purposes, but is not what I wanted or expected - the photo with the phone inside of the purse shows the phone in the inner small side-pourch, but I thought it was in the main compartment, so I was under the impression the purse was smaller than it actually is.",27991,2
27991,"Because the purse is a purse rather than a wallet, the shoulder strap would be more useful than the wriststrap (at least for me).",27991,2
27991,"The shoulder strap that it comes with is not impressive - while the metal details are nice and sturdy, the strap is made of ugly fabric on one side with a smaller strip of leather sewn to it.",27991,2
27991,It actually makes me think of the strap that I used to carry my saxophone with in junior high.,27991,2
27991,"The purse itself and the wriststrap are both soft leather, and the zipper is a nice accent (I ordered black, which comes with gold zippers).",27991,2
27991,"I just received this purse in the mail, so cannot yet speak to the durability of it, though I can see spots where the leather is already cracking along the seam.",27991,2
27991,"Because of the leather's quality, the size, and the unappealing shoulder strap, this bag is going back.",27991,2
27991,"In theory, the purse would be nice, but the quality is just not quite there, unless you want to buy another one in a few weeks.",27991,2
27992,The color was vibrant.,27992,2
27992,It appeared to have fit as expected but I never placed it on my head.,27992,2
27992,The smell was awful even after being washed twice I could not tolerate the odor and dare not place it on my person..,27992,2
27992,I tossed it into the trash.,27992,2
27993,The fit was good on the sides but the boob coverage was too small and it was far too short.,27993,2
27994,When these gloves first arrived I was very impressed.,27994,2
27994,"The fit is generous (definitely on the large side), and the cool-mesh design provides lots of airflow yet still completely covers the hands for sun protection.",27994,2
27994,I've also learned they dry out very quickly if you have to ride in the rain.,27994,2
27994,"The bad news:  After wearing these for only about a month (roughly 2,500 motorcycle miles including two overnight trips and daily commuting to work), they're falling apart.",27994,2
27994,"On the under side of the gloves, the elastic band is coming apart at the seam from the palm.",27994,2
27994,"Similarly, the top side of the gloves are coming apart at the seem in the webbing between the thumb and first ringer.",27994,2
27994,"Also, the outer layer of mesh is really starting to fray.",27994,2
27994,"It's a shame - I really liked these gloves when they first arrived, but they're just not holding up that well.",27994,2
27995,For a few bucks more get charles tyrwhitt!,27995,2
27996,"These sock are not long enough to be considered ""over the knee.""",27996,2
27997,Don't like how this shirt fits,27997,2
27998,It ripped before the first use,27998,2
27999,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,27999,2
27999,"Too big , different fit !",27999,2
28000,Runs small.,28000,2
28000,It smells yucky.,28000,2
28001,Overall fit was ok except way too short.,28001,2
28001,Showed stomach and I'm not a very tall person.,28001,2
28001,I would recommend going a size up.,28001,2
28002,They are very see through and don't look as good as I thought they would.,28002,2
28003,"This piece is gorgeous,However parts of it continued to fall off and I had to put it back on.",28003,2
28003,I actually wore this today.,28003,2
28004,I bought these and when they got here the only one that was good was the rainbow one.,28004,2
28004,The rest of them?,28004,2
28004,The paint was flaking off within that hour.,28004,2
28004,And got my tongue infected.,28004,2
28005,It looks beautiful as pictured.,28005,2
28005,"However, that wasn't the case.",28005,2
28005,Its appearance is very cheap looking.,28005,2
28005,A little bummed.,28005,2
28005,Gave it to my 5 year old grand daughter to play with.,28005,2
28006,"Returning back, size is way smaller than it says.",28006,2
28006,But Amazon will refund your money very easily!!,28006,2
28006,!,28006,2
28007,I ordered a 3x bc it said they run 1-2 sizes smaller.,28007,2
28007,"The bathing suit was a little big, but the boob area was WAY too small!!!",28007,2
28007,It was like a c cup when I wear an F!!,28007,2
28007,"You would think they would make the boob area bigger, with the larger size...only 1/4 of my chest fit in it",28007,2
28008,I ordered a small and it looks nothing on me like it does in the photo- these are more straight legged pants than trackpants.,28008,2
28009,Watch is cheap looking and band is even cheaper.,28009,2
28010,Extra large not even close.,28010,2
28010,Feels like a medium.,28010,2
28011,These are SO CUTE but they run AT LEAST two sizes too small.,28011,2
28011,And my best guess is that these will shrink when washed too.,28011,2
28012,"The armholes are cut very strangely, such that there is a lot of extra fabric just sort of 'hanging' around it.",28012,2
28012,Very odd.,28012,2
28012,I'll replace it soon and give to Goodwill.,28012,2
28013,"after ordering a specific size and being contacted to send my measurements, the dress is smaller than I wanted.",28013,2
28013,I measured big so there would be some room.,28013,2
28013,I was disappointed that it took a lot longer than expected and now I have to keep it due to it being maid in China.,28013,2
28013,If I had known this in advance I would not have ordered it.,28013,2
28014,Very awkward fit - the knot in the front doesn't really seem to function properly.,28014,2
28014,I've only worn the top once and it was with a highwaisted skirt where the top was tucked in.,28014,2
28014,I think I'll only wear it with highwaisted bottoms when I can tuck the shirt in because the bottom is so baggy that it looks sloppy.,28014,2
28015,"Quality seems ok and they ""fit"" my ears BUT the are not snug and the wind leaks in around the edges.",28015,2
28015,Have removed and put them back on my ears a dozen times and they still leak.,28015,2
28015,Going back,28015,2
28016,"Cute pattern, fit way too small, 35 weeks pregnant and couldn't get the l/xl to close over my belly.",28016,2
28016,"I bought two gowns from the same company in the same size, both fit perfectly, so I'm not sure what the problem is, bc robes are meant to run large I thought... anyway, I have to return it.",28016,2
28016,I'm sure it'd be nice if it fit well.,28016,2
28017,You get what you pay for!,28017,2
28017,Cheap material...,28017,2
28018,Soft but very bulky and heavy.,28018,2
28018,I was looking for a robe that was warm but lighter - ended up giving it away!,28018,2
28019,"First off, the material and design of this is SUPER cute...if you can get it on!",28019,2
28019,"In regular clothing, I wear a large or XL, am a size 14 pant, have a 36DD chest, and have an hourglass shape.",28019,2
28019,I read reviews on this and ordered up several sizes up and it still will not fit!,28019,2
28019,The sizing on this is absolutely crazy.,28019,2
28019,"In addition, the way the hooks are, I question how securely it stays on if you do get it to fit.",28019,2
28019,"If you are over a size 12 or have larger breasts, do not attempt to order this because even the size 3X will not fit.",28019,2
28019,Totally bums be out too because it is so cute.,28019,2
28020,Save your money and get something better.... or if you want to help people of Malaysia by all means.... but you get what you pay for..,28020,2
28021,Runs to big for a thin person specially in the  bottom sides.,28021,2
28022,It was a small and it was still to big =[,28022,2
28023,"I ordered the dark blue/navy one and when I opened the package, it was purple, which it was the wrong color!",28023,2
28023,I was kind of disappointed as well because the fitting was a little snug on me.,28023,2
28023,"I usually wear a medium for leggings but since a lot of the reviews here said to order a size up and not only that it is from China too, so I thought to order a size up.",28023,2
28023,It still feels a little tight.,28023,2
28023,I don't know if it's tight because I have a booty or what....,28023,2
28023,"But if you have a booty, I would probably order two size up so your lady friends back there can breath!",28023,2
28024,Broke immediately,28024,2
28025,Too small.,28025,2
28025,Sized to fit a child's ankle.,28025,2
28025,Deceptive,28025,2
28026,Looks like my girl put my 16 month old daughters seashell toys on her boobs.,28026,2
28026,Fits like crap.,28026,2
28026,Looks like crap,28026,2
28027,Didn't fit my 13mo old,28027,2
28028,Got here early but definitely not long like it shows in the picture and has a weird smell the sleeves are very short so you'd have to wear them scrunched up I wouldn't say id recommend this to anyone I definitely got what I paid for tho my expectations just were not meant so best of luck to whoever else decides to get it,28028,2
28029,Looks big on the picture but way too small in reality,28029,2
28030,"Small ,and you could see right through it,I sent it back.",28030,2
28030,"Maybe in a different color,it would be better.",28030,2
28031,"Although, I was pleased with the fit and buttons, overall I was really disappointed in these swim diapers in action.",28031,2
28031,They swelled up with the water and sagged on my one year old almost immediately and stayed that way until I removed them and wrung them out.,28031,2
28031,They looked very uncomfortable.,28031,2
28031,We will not be continuing to use them.,28031,2
28031,Looking for a better option.,28031,2
28032,I ordered this leotard and used their fitting chart.,28032,2
28032,It fits in the top but is far too long.,28032,2
28032,I can't wear it because it looks like I'm wearing a diaper.,28032,2
28032,I gave it to my sister instead.,28032,2
28033,"bottom was the right size, the pot too big!",28033,2
28034,weird material.,28034,2
28034,very plastic,28034,2
28035,Product smelled really weird on arrival.,28035,2
28035,"Also this is not an adult garment, even ordering two sizes larger than I would normally buy this item was still no where close to fitting.",28035,2
28036,MAde for tiny oriental women,28036,2
28037,The seams were done wrong so the dress could not be worn.,28037,2
28038,"The case just isn't big enough, in all the dimensions, to properly hold more than 10 cards (5 on either side) comfortably.",28038,2
28038,"If you've ever handed out business cards, you know you need to carry more than just ten.",28038,2
28038,Taking cards out and putting them in can also be more work than it's worth.,28038,2
28038,"The materials used are too soft, as the hinge and spring simply don't hold up.",28038,2
28038,The release button also became easily detached after the case was dropped once from a height of four feet.,28038,2
28038,"In other words, keep looking at other card holders and pass this one up.",28038,2
28039,Would Bea prefect jumpsuit but was cut too high for persons with a long torso.,28039,2
28040,Too large and very loose in the waist,28040,2
28041,I received this dress today after being excited and was so disappointed by the quality.,28041,2
28041,"As far as fit goes -- I'm 5'3"" approx 115lbs with an athletic build.",28041,2
28041,The dress was perfect length to not be dragging but still be a maxi dress covering my ankles and such.,28041,2
28041,It was a nice fit other than the elastic waist which kept riding up and making my breasts look incredibly awkward (full 32b/small 32c).,28041,2
28041,My biggest problem with this dress is the fabric.,28041,2
28041,It feels like very cheap swimsuit fabric.,28041,2
28041,It is quite thin and stiff -- the type of fabric that would be extremely easy to wrinkle.,28041,2
28041,The texture is simply not at all what I wanted.,28041,2
28041,If a swimsuit texture is something you would prefer (perhaps you're using it for walking on the beach and it would be great for being able to brush off sand quite easy) then maybe consider this dress...however this was not what I assumed from the description and picture.,28041,2
28041,I felt like I was trying on a thin tarp.,28041,2
28041,"Yes, a tarp.",28041,2
28041,"After purchasing this dress and many other small pieces of clothing from Amazon, I can now say I won't be doing so in the future as everything that is ""off branded"" is awful quality...much like those warehouse shops in China with super cheap online sites.",28041,2
28042,Ordered one size up but should have ordered 2 sizes up.,28042,2
28042,Way too small.,28042,2
28042,Had to return.,28042,2
28043,Completely see-thru.,28043,2
28043,"They're weirdly short cut, like...butt hanging out, yet they're loose on me.",28043,2
28043,"I'm 5'1"" with a 23 in waist and 34 in hips.",28043,2
28044,Im not sure why i cant say what i want but what ever.,28044,2
28044,Two stars and that is being nice.,28044,2
28045,It is what it is.,28045,2
28045,Fake!,28045,2
28045,We go into it knowing.,28045,2
28045,Bought these for my boys.,28045,2
28045,To test to see how long they can keep and take care.,28045,2
28046,It came with pink lining which I didn't see in the picture and was way too small.,28046,2
28047,It's not at all what I expected.,28047,2
28047,"I'm disappointed because it made me look like a huge block and I'm 5'2"" and 120 pounds.",28047,2
28047,I was hoping for something more feminine and flattering rather than boxey.,28047,2
28047,Ohh well.,28047,2
28048,It's like the XL shirts I bought in Hong Kong.,28048,2
28048,It seems sizing is not in agreement worldwide.,28048,2
28049,One of the handles broke 1 hour after first use,28049,2
28050,legs look longer than they are.,28050,2
28051,Back section fits big.,28051,2
28051,When zippedn there's a big piece of fabric dropping down.,28051,2
28051,Maybe my shoulders not broad enough for it.,28051,2
28052,The product did not fit in the thigh area.,28052,2
28052,"I ordered a 1X-2X and I am 5'4"" and weigh 180bls which actually puts me in the L-XL range but I was expecting it to run a bit small.",28052,2
28052,"Little did I know, but I guess they expect a thick woman's thighs to be no bigger than her ankles or calves because they used the exact same amount of material for the whole leg of the tights no extra stretch in the thighs at all.",28052,2
28052,I could not pull them up past the knee and there was a bit too much material at the ankle.,28052,2
28052,Such a disappointment because I had no other problem with them.,28052,2
28052,They are really thick and warm and appear well made otherwise I would have rated the a 1.,28052,2
28052,"But even if you order a size that fits your thighs, I'm sure the material would just bunch up at the ankles.",28052,2
28052,Thats what happens when you make clothes shaped like boxes instead of for real people.,28052,2
28053,Too short and too low waisted.,28053,2
28054,See through and looks like a nightgown.,28054,2
28054,Not flattering at all.,28054,2
28055,"Love the style, color and fit!",28055,2
28055,"The body is perfect, but there is no cup room!",28055,2
28055,"I ordered two sizes larger fox extra cup space and again, the body fits nicely, but if I went any larger to get a ""normal"" cup, it would be too loose.",28055,2
28055,"I don't understand why a 2xl suit, would come with a B cup.",28055,2
28056,And recompensated.,28056,2
28056,"If you are an overtly curvy girl (b=38-40"" w=30-32"" h=46-48"") this swimsuit is not for you.",28056,2
28057,Bummed I didn't get the ones I ordered!,28057,2
28057,"Plus they say 100% cotton, but they are not soft at all.",28057,2
28057,Maybe very low quality cotton.,28057,2
28058,fits tight.,28058,2
28058,order larger for proper fit,28058,2
28059,This item goes to the model's knees in the photo.,28059,2
28059,"In reality, it goes to just below the belt buckle.",28059,2
28059,"I wasn't expecting anything TOO nice for the price, but I was disappointed in the length.",28059,2
28059,It is a vey thin shirt like material.,28059,2
28059,Not a sweater at all.,28059,2
28059,"I'll wear it, but it might be a deal breaker for others.",28059,2
28060,Not true to the description.,28060,2
28061,it fit like a choker so it was way too small.,28061,2
28062,I have a rather short torso and this swimsuit was not long enough for me which created a weird tightness in the wrong areas.,28062,2
28062,It was also too wide at the waste which created some bulging.,28062,2
28062,"I am 5""7 and 138 pounds, 34DD cup.",28062,2
28062,Needless to say the top part did not fit at all.,28062,2
28062,It is a cute swimsuit and really wish it had fit.,28062,2
28062,Maybe for some other body types this would look great but it's a gamble you are just going to have to take.,28062,2
28063,"Fun, but low quality socks.",28063,2
28063,"They were cheap enough, but after two or three wearings all are already thrown out due to holes in the heels.",28063,2
28063,I would not buy them again.,28063,2
28064,Super tight in the chest and super see thru!,28064,2
28065,not the same color tie I ordered with the shirt,28065,2
28066,To small to fit my big face,28066,2
28067,ugly..... it doesn't look like the picture,28067,2
28068,"I'm 5'4 about 157 lbs, I ordered a large the length was fine it came to my akles.",28068,2
28068,But it made awkward the back of the bunches up where it crosses at.,28068,2
28068,"It also very thin, I'm glad it was only 20 dollars you pay for what you get.",28068,2
28069,"Ordered LARGE, it arrived as a US size 8.",28069,2
28069,"Waited to long to return, so going to swap.com.",28069,2
28069,Very flimsy fabric.,28069,2
28070,This is an absolute JOKE.,28070,2
28070,"The top wouldn't  support someone win a B cup, let alone a D.
The elastic is loose and baggy.",28070,2
28070,The shorts are thin and have no liner... plan on the whole world seeing through them once they are wet.,28070,2
28070,"The only thing I could possibly  wear is the tank, and even that will fall apart quickly, as it has no seems along the edges.",28070,2
28070,Do not waste your money on this.,28070,2
28071,"As a previous review said, there is no padding and the back of the bottoms is NOT scrunched which is why I made the purchase.",28071,2
28071,Disappointed.,28071,2
28072,"The material is soft, but the item is mot great.",28072,2
28072,"The slits for breastfeeding just fall open on their own, so your nipples are out and unprotected most of the time.",28072,2
28072,It is a very poor design.,28072,2
28073,Not happy with the quality and fit of the sweater at all.,28073,2
28074,"I bought two for me and my friend, they both ended up breaking after a month, and they don't really look like handcuffs in person ):",28074,2
28075,Not a very well constructed sweater and was very wrinkled when it arrived.,28075,2
28076,Returning this product.,28076,2
28076,I was looking for more of a fitted sweatshirt dress.,28076,2
28076,"I ordered according to size chart and this one is baggy on the sides, not fitted.",28076,2
28077,"The cape is so tight around the neck it feels like it's meant for a child, and the bust part of the outfit is huge",28077,2
28078,I ordered the Strawberries.,28078,2
28078,"The fit of the dress is good,  The pattern is pretty.",28078,2
28078,"HOWEVER, the fabric is no 80% cotton as advertised.",28078,2
28078,It is the same type of material that is used as internal slip lining in many dresses.,28078,2
28078,I live in Florida.,28078,2
28078,There will be some days that I will be able to wear this but it won't last long or at least won't hold up under the weather and wearing.,28078,2
28078,It is very thin material.,28078,2
28078,Also the belt matches but is much too short to fit the size dress I ordered.,28078,2
28078,Luckily I have a red belt already.,28078,2
28078,I'm very disappointed in the fabric.,28078,2
28078,I like this type of dress and have ordered several from different vendors.,28078,2
28078,But I prefer them in cotton and thought that was what I was ordering here.,28078,2
28079,The front pockets are huge!!,28079,2
28079,The bottom elastic that is suppose to be snug around your calf was over an inch to big.,28079,2
28080,I wear a size med order a 2X and it still ran as a x-small!,28080,2
28081,What I  got in the mail does not look like rlthe one in the picture.,28081,2
28082,not really what I expected.,28082,2
28083,"you get what you pay for..this is TRULY a ribbed knit long, long tank top...",28083,2
28084,On the bigger side should of gotten a size smaller.,28084,2
28085,Doesn't fit as expected.,28085,2
28085,Shirt is wide not long as it appears in picture.,28085,2
28086,Many women like myself are into more vintage clothing.,28086,2
28086,"I wanted to add this to my collection due to color, price and style.",28086,2
28086,I loved how the breast area would become more lifted and a little more of a focal point than most dresses out there.,28086,2
28086,"Unfortunately, mine wouldn't fit even with ordering up a size.",28086,2
28086,Although I love clothes from the 1940s-1970s I have a different time finding dresses and tops to fit correctly.,28086,2
28086,"Positive: very cute, stylish, medium weight, my favorite color, vintage, flirty
Negative: bought a size larger and wouldn't fit, no space for larger breasted females",28086,2
28087,....I must say this was disappointing.,28087,2
28087,"..not what I expected...
Should of gotten a size larger..plus, the neck and chest area of the shirt it's too wide, luckily my woman is a smeatress and will customize it to my liking.",28087,2
28087,...,28087,2
28088,"The graphics on the shirt are very dull, not vivid like the picture.",28088,2
28088,The shirt had a very odd smell.,28088,2
28088,Disappointed.,28088,2
28089,Love this suit but the top was WAY  to small   GO UP A SIZE BEFOR YOU GET IT,28089,2

28097,Good for costume but not for actual kid play.,28097,2
28098,I don't know what is going on with this dress.,28098,2
28098,I don't even know how to go about fixing it to make it work.,28098,2

28104,isn't even sewed correctly,28104,2
28105,I was excited when I ordered the dress I really liked the look of it.,28105,2
28105,"But was sadly disappointed when I got it, it fit which I was surprised by but after the first wash it literally fell apart there are white lines all over the dress and a hole in the side.",28105,2

28109,Bottoms also fit weird.,28109,2
28109,I have a rather large booty but smaller waist.,28109,2

28109,The back of the bottoms go way too far up my back.,28109,2
28109,"Fits nice on the lower half of the booty, very Brazilian style but goes way too far up my lower back.",28109,2

28112,Really cheap,28112,2
28113,Cute but I don't like the material..,28113,2
28114,Very pretty.,28114,2
28114,I know it is fake opal but this is clearly incredibly fake to the point it doesn't even really look like other fake opals.,28114,2
28114,"It is pretty, and I will keep it but I would not buy from this company again.",28114,2
28115,"Hat was way too small - like, way too small.",28115,2

28123,"The bottoms are great, any bigger and they would be too loose, the top however is tiny in comparison and there is no room in the cups!",28123,2
28123,Why do XL swimming suits come with push up A cups?!,28123,2
28123,The straps on the suit also do not stay attached and should be modified.,28123,2
28124,I gave two stars for design,28124,2

28140,I don't know what it is.,28140,2
28140,Other comments have suggested they might be fake havaianas.,28140,2
28140,I wonder....,28140,2
28141,I purchased these based on other clothing I have by this brand.,28141,2
28141,These are too small and scratchy.,28141,2
28141,Plus I don't think they had an elastic waist.,28141,2

28142,It OK. Just smaller than I thought.,28142,2
28143,These are terrible.,28143,2
28143,They constantly are sliding down and easily stretch out as you wear them.,28143,2
28143,By the end of the evening it looked like I had two saggy sacks on my legs.,28143,2
28143,I even tried to wear them with garters and the knees became loose.,28143,2
28143,You get what you pay for.,28143,2
28144,Color of gold is brassy,28144,2
28145,I wish I would have read the customer reviews.,28145,2
28145,The picture and description is very misleading.,28145,2
28145,I wouldn't have spent 5.99 on ONE bracelet.,28145,2
28145,I was buying this for some of my ADHD students.,28145,2
28145,... oh well,28145,2

28147,"(Note: What looks like a bow is actually a piece of fabric stuffed through a loop, in case that matters to you, but it ends up looking bow-like nonetheless.)",28147,2

28147,"I'm 5'3"", short-waisted with long legs for my height and a big rack, and the waistline on this dress is RIDICULOUSLY high.",28147,2
28147,"The bow thingy ends up being on the bottom of my rib cage, so it's not even enough space/fabric for it to reach my natural waist (which I still think would be a little too high for this style).",28147,2
28147,"If Miusol would change the pattern of their dresses to place the waistline somewhere more reasonable for the average American adult woman, I'd probably buy literally everything they make.",28147,2
28147,"So, if you are blessedly lacking in breasts and are overall a pretty slender and short person, then I think this would look adorable on you.",28147,2
28148,Fit as expected but material is not durable.,28148,2
28148,First time I wore it threading came undone on one of the sleeves and bottom seam.,28148,2

28148,Will not be purchasing another shirt from this manufacturer.,28148,2
28149,Very very small.,28149,2
28149,A medium is comparable to a XS,28149,2

28155,Well that was very wrong.,28155,2
28155,The bottoms fit perfectly and are very cute.,28155,2
28155,The top was tiny on me...probably would fit a C...nothing bigger.,28155,2
28155,I'm going to keep the bottoms and try to find a top that fits.,28155,2
28155,If you're not exactly the same on top and bottom this is not the bathing suit for you.,28155,2
28156,I ordered a size 3x-they are more like a L/XL.,28156,2
28156,The color was as pictured-just WAY to small for me to wear.,28156,2
28156,And they did not have hardly any stretch.,28156,2
28156,Ended up finding a pair at Wal-Mart.,28156,2

28166,"I put Em on and when I took it off, the part you clip on the hoop broke off.",28166,2
28167,The shirt I received was very different from the one pictured.,28167,2

28169,Just not that great!,28169,2

28171,Beautiful but seems to break easily at the clasp,28171,2
28172,Way to thin made not even a tag and it's not even a 1.00 yard sale shirt,28172,2
28173,"It's really cute unfortunatly the fit is like an XS, I got a size M since I'm a size 4 normally and usually fit S-M but this bikini did not come close to it :(",28173,2

and where do order replacement material ?",28176,2

28178,This little dress appears to be really made of thin material and does not look well made.,28178,2
28178,Otherwise it looks as pictured and fit true to size.,28178,2
28178,I woud not recommend it even at this price.,28178,2
28179,It's really long.,28179,2
28179,Wasn't expecting it to be that long!,28179,2
28180,THE SIZING IS NOT CORRECT,28180,2
28181,The design sticks out from the side of the skinny jean and they don't fit all.,28181,2
28182,low quality suit.,28182,2
28182,"If you swim in it, it will probably fall off you.",28182,2

28183,"Loose like leather, photo looks like it's firm.",28183,2

28184,"While these are very comfortable,  I bought them so I didn't have to wear a bra (I breastfeed).",28184,2
28184,The description sated there was  a built in bra.,28184,2
28184,There is NO built in bra.,28184,2
28184,Not at ALL what I wanted.,28184,2
28184,I gave it 2 stars due to lying in the description.,28184,2
28185,Paper eyes do not really blink the way I hoped.,28185,2
28186,Way too small for the size I ordered.,28186,2
28187,The most important part of any band is the clasp.,28187,2
28187,This one is of poor quality.,28187,2
28187,Too much wiggle and clearances.,28187,2
28187,When trying to close it gets misaligned and stuck awkwardly.,28187,2
28187,Spend a bit more and get a another brand.,28187,2
28188,"I've owned this belt for a year and was very pleased with it, a five star rating for sure, until 1 year and 1 month later I go to put  the belt on and the belt just slides; turns out the catching mechanism is made of chrome-plated plastic and a tiny spring.",28188,2
28188,Quality of the rest of this belt is great and loved it but its sad that the most important part of this belt is made with the cheapest materials.,28188,2
28189,was very disappointed when I received this dress.,28189,2
28189,it looked so lovely online but what I received was some washout pale purple cloth.,28189,2
28189,the pockets were way too high up.,28189,2
28189,the color off and the dress is very unattractive.,28189,2

28189,regret buying.,28189,2
28189,"horrible color, the dress looked like it was worn and washed 72 times.",28189,2
28190,It does not look as nice as online.,28190,2
28191,I take medium tank tops...this is tight & short,28191,2
28192,I purchased this shirt from  fkbey fashion store.,28192,2
28192,"The M was definitely not a normal M, must be a China M. It must be child size!",28192,2
28192,I could not even get my arm in one of the sleeves!,28192,2
28192,As much as I want the shirt because of Prince but I requested a return/refund!,28192,2
28192,I received an email with information to return it to in the states.,28192,2
28192,"If you want this shirt you may consider buying from a seller in the states, maybe the shirt will be normal US sizes!",28192,2
28193,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday - he's an avid cyclist and we watch the tour every year,  He loved the shirt, but unfortunately, the large was too small for him and he's been a standard men's size large for 20 years!",28193,2
28193,"I am very disappointed that it's too small because he really likes the shirt, which is the reason for the low rating.",28193,2
28193,The description should have indicated that they run small and to buy a size larger!,28193,2
28194,Super cute for a 12 year old.,28194,2
28194,TINY!,28194,2
28195,"a  bit thin, not lined.",28195,2
28196,Too short.,28196,2
28196,More width than length.,28196,2
28197,Reading the reviews stated to order up significantly.,28197,2
28197,"At 5' 2"" 150 I got an XXL, way too big, think I would stick with going maybe 1 size up so I probably should have gotten a medium.",28197,2
28197,"The style however is as shown, very pretty and would probably be flattering if it was the correct size.",28197,2
28197,Will be returning this one,28197,2
28198,Way too small my iPhone 6+ cell will not fit in its case.,28198,2
28198,Also the clasp is very hard to close I'm returning it.,28198,2
28199,These were a huge disappointment!!!,28199,2
28199,"I've been buying these for years and this was the first ""bad batch"" I had gotten.",28199,2
28199,"The fabric was totally different, there was hardly any body to the bra, the cups were very flimsy and the bands were so tight they actually hurt.",28199,2
28199,"If I'm going to were a bra that hurts, I'll go buy an underlined bra.",28199,2
28199,NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THE BRAS I'VE PURCHASED IN THE PAST.,28199,2
28200,"Unfortunately, not what I expected.",28200,2
28200,The length is a bit long.,28200,2
28200,"However, the fabric is what really turned me off, just didn't feel comfortable to me.",28200,2
28200,There was also a small mark across a section of the white band.,28200,2
28200,This item will be getting returned.,28200,2
28201,Hurts like a bitch my whole tounge is swollen hurts so bad I was swollen for 2weeksbut nice jewelrys,28201,2
28202,I followed the size chart but it's too small and uncomfortable.,28202,2
28202,I'm disappointed that I spent as much as I did on this.,28202,2
28203,"The product description failed to say that it would require some set up,  it was rather complicated to put on as it didn't come with instructions on how to assemble it .",28203,2
28203,When I eventually figured out how to put it together and get it on the bottom strap was unnecessarily large while the rest was small.,28203,2
28204,For costume purposes - this in fine.,28204,2
28204,NOT for anything else...,28204,2
28205,"Pleasantly surprised on how cute this dress was, but the large size would not fit my size 6 frame.",28205,2
28205,"The extra star is for the fact that the dress is cute, otherwise, the fit would be zero stars.",28205,2
28205,Returned this one.,28205,2
28206,The company was great and sent me a different size for free.,28206,2
28206,"However, the quality of these shoes is terrible.",28206,2
28206,2 weeks of use and they are falling apart.,28206,2
28206,Insides are coming out and bottoms are coming apart.,28206,2
28206,I would not buy these again.,28206,2
28206,See pictures below!,28206,2
28207,Zippers  broke 1st day i use it.,28207,2
28208,A bit smaller than expected,28208,2
28209,Swimsuit fit well and is very flattering.,28209,2
28209,The support cups are not fixed in place so they do move around when you're swimming...,28209,2
28209,I was planning on stitching mine in place.,28209,2
28209,"I was disappointed to find after my first use of the swimsuit that there was a hole along the inner seam... looking at the seam you can see how poorly cut and stitched the item is, but it's relative to it's price.",28209,2
28210,This is the second bathing suit I have ordered.,28210,2
28210,The top fit great but the bottoms we're too small.,28210,2
28210,"I ordered a large because it said ""sizes run small"" ...when I ordered the second suit size xl bottoms were huge!",28210,2
28210,Disappointed,28210,2
28211,VERY cheap material.,28211,2
28211,Very Low quality!,28211,2
28212,I had originally ordered this for my son's Halloween costume and was disappointed with how long it took to get here.,28212,2
28212,Anyway......received and examined it and it is amazing!,28212,2
28212,"Thick, soft, quality fabric.",28212,2
28212,Amazingly put together.,28212,2
28212,Now it's a Christmas present.,28212,2
28212,Christmas has come and gone so my son has now used the outfit.......I attempted to use the zipper(mind you this is the 1st time as I said attempted) and the zipper fell apartin my hands.,28212,2
28212,So needless to say I have a very miserable 4 yr old and im past the return window.,28212,2
28212,Thanks China.,28212,2
28213,Top has funky breast cover,28213,2
28214,I love the design except the metal part of the scarf spread all over my clothes like glitter.,28214,2
28215,waaaaay too small.... if u have booty.,28215,2
28215,don't order this.,28215,2
28216,It is a bit too small which is odd it said it for true to size.,28216,2
28216,I am orally an xsmall-small.,28216,2
28216,"Ordered a small
Very Low plunge cannot wear it with totally exposing myself",28216,2
28217,Is to small,28217,2
28218,Disapointing... its really little in comparison of what it looked like in the picture.. and also the swarovski heart color is diferent....,28218,2
28219,Broke pretty easy.,28219,2
28219,I just took it apart for the charms tbh.,28219,2
28219,It is a pretty bracelet though!,28219,2
28220,way too small,28220,2
28221,"This is really pretty, and soft, but whatever the ad and tag say, I doubt if there is a cotton fiber in it, anywhere.",28221,2
28221,"In minutes, I was sweating as if I had a plastic bag draped around me, and in 74-degree weather.",28221,2
28221,"I may be able to wear it over a thin long-sleeved dress, or something when the weather gets cold.",28221,2
28221,"Otherwise, probably will give away.",28221,2
28222,Couldn't wait for this to arrive unfortunately it feels as if it was made for children.,28222,2
28222,I will be able to wear the top after cutting out the ridiculous bust cups.,28222,2
28222,The shorts on the other hand are absurdly tight and accentuate any loose skin on thighs.,28222,2
28223,This is not the same sweater shown in the pic and it's not pink it's Fuschia.,28223,2
28223,It doesn't have the neckline shown.,28223,2
28223,Fits weird.,28223,2
28224,"It had a hole up top that looked like it had been burned, it was covered in black ink and no amount of cleaning and seeing could fix it.",28224,2
28224,"I may have just gotten a bad one, but I was not a fan.",28224,2
28225,"Very cute shirt, but definitely too small in my chest area.",28225,2
28226,"A lot of people said they wore this as a shirt, but it is practically see through and very short!",28226,2
28226,Disappointed to say the least!,28226,2
28227,Do not waste your money.,28227,2
28227,This is made poorly.,28227,2
28227,For the price I guess what can you expect?,28227,2
28227,"But seriously, pay a little more elsewhere for better quality.",28227,2
28228,"not enough room in bust area, workmanship was good",28228,2
28229,Too big!,28229,2
28230,Cause they corny as hell,28230,2
28231,i am sooooo sad..I usually wear a size large so i buyed the biggest size they had and it was still too small and really short.,28231,2
28231,I was really upset because i loved the style and material of the dress.,28231,2
28231,It does look exactly as pictured but just the sizes were just completely off.,28231,2
28232,Not for taller girls.,28232,2
28232,"If you're  5'8 and up, its going to be too small",28232,2
28233,it feels like plastic.,28233,2
28233,it is so light weight.,28233,2
28233,no substance.,28233,2
28234,"Returned for a refund after waiting several days for it to arrive, and then it was way too small.",28234,2
28235,Really small.,28235,2
28235,But looks sexy.,28235,2
28235,Just not comfortable to be wearing all day.,28235,2
28236,"Material feels cheap, and a button popped off the first time I wore it.",28236,2
28237,I am normally a large and ordered an extra large.,28237,2
28237,This dress is skin tight!,28237,2
28237,not loose like the picture shows.,28237,2
28237,I'm keeping it for the fall when I can wear this with leggings & boots,28237,2
28238,Gave it away,28238,2
28239,wish it was screen printed,28239,2
28240,Size run small and it ripped from the side of a leg the first time I wore them.,28240,2
28241,Super cute!,28241,2
28241,same material and same look as image But wayyyy too small..,28241,2
28241,"I am 5.4-5.5 and 117-120 lbs so i got a medium but I could barely squeeze this on without ripping it, and to add to the tinniness of the bodysuit the back was still really baggy...",28241,2
28241,I would order an extra large next time.,28241,2
28241,I would have returned for a larger size but still have not gotten a return confirmation,28241,2
28242,Fit way too big for my baby's head.,28242,2
28242,Ended up giving it to my 12 year old sister.,28242,2
28243,"I am 5'2"" as always I have to hem my clothes.",28243,2
28243,It is O.K..,28243,2
28243,The print on the dress seamed on the surface ( like painted on) .,28243,2
28243,I would like a more dyed look.,28243,2
28244,Didn't do much of anything.,28244,2
28244,Not sure it it's because I'm only 14 weeks but I was hoping to feel more comfortable in jeans.,28244,2
28244,The band kept rolling up and didn't really keep my pants up.,28244,2
28244,I ended up buttoning my pants in the middle of a party and taking it off.,28244,2
28244,It also smelled terrible when I opened it!,28244,2
28245,Keeps breaking.,28245,2
28246,I truly liked thevdesign of this top.,28246,2
28246,I ordered an extra large to accommodate my hips.,28246,2
28246,The lower part of the top clings like a spandex mini.,28246,2
28246,I will  give each it away.,28246,2
28247,Confortable but I wear it as a dress because it is unbelievably large,28247,2
28248,"This umbrella, while adorable, is very poorly made.",28248,2
28248,It arrived in a dented box with a severly dented handle.,28248,2
28248,"When I tried to pull it out of the box and gently straighten the huge bend in the pole, it snapped in my hands and gave me a pretty bad cut on my hand.",28248,2
28248,It also came very dusty.,28248,2
28248,Very disappointed.,28248,2
28249,Quality is fine just did not fit loosely like expected,28249,2
28250,"This isn't a ""long-line"" corset, like I expected.",28250,2
28250,I should pay more attention to wording.,28250,2
28250,"Also, the quality wasn't as good as some of the other corsets I have bought from Camellias.",28250,2
28250,"The fabric didn't seem as thick and durable, and the quality of the boning wasn't as good as other corsets.",28250,2
28250,"It was steel-boning, but it felt more like a costuming corset.",28250,2
28251,Very pretty but very small.,28251,2
28252,Wish I had downsized,28252,2
28253,Looked a little like a bad ballet costume.,28253,2
28253,It could be altered into a decent dress but would need a ton of work,28253,2
28254,The material is very flimsy.,28254,2
28254,I got what I paid for.,28254,2
28255,disappointed that item  arrived today with a bent nose piece .,28255,2
28255,otherwise the glasses work well.,28255,2
28255,i will reorder this item.,28255,2
28255,its strange that there was no visible damage to shipping box.,28255,2
28256,Black one had a hole in it.,28256,2
28256,Too lazy to return.,28256,2
28257,"I followed the sizing chart and WOW, was it wrong!",28257,2
28257,Hopefully I can get a refund.,28257,2
28258,"Arrived on time which is of very high quality and excellent but the measurement is not required, a small and fits",28258,2
28259,Too Big and strings were VERY loose and oversized..returning,28259,2
28260,"If you have the ""thick hair"" hair elastics, this won't work, it's too small for them.",28260,2
28261,Way to small and cheaply made,28261,2
28262,I don't like the product .,28262,2
28262,First of all its smaller than you expect .,28262,2
28262,Secondly color is completely different from the one shown in the picture.,28262,2
28263,You get what you pay for simple as that.,28263,2
28263,It broke the first day I wore it.,28263,2
28263,"I can fix it but it made me mad that on the first time wearing it , it breaks.",28263,2
28263,where the two owls link together.,28263,2
28263,I don't even remember it getting caught on anything for it to break.,28263,2
28263,so like I said yeah guess Its ok for 1$,28263,2
28264,couldnt wear these,28264,2
28265,2 of the scarfs were fine the 3rd one has a pink tint to it.,28265,2
28265,Would not order again!,28265,2
28265,!,28265,2
28266,Looks cheap.,28266,2
28267,"material is okay, they run VERY VERY SHORT.",28267,2
28267,Returned them.,28267,2
28268,Thought these offered support.... only good as an insert for bathing suit instead of foam pads,28268,2
28269,"Could not zip it up all the way- I ordered a medium, which is my usual size (5'7'' and 145lb) and the dress did not fit my shoulders, which are not abnormally wide or large.",28269,2
28269,"The dress was obscenely short, so short that the spandex I wore underneath while trying it on peeked out.",28269,2
28269,"Cute pattern and seemed well made, but definitely too small and way too short.",28269,2
28269,"Better to size up and/or wear it as a shirt with fully opaque pants underneath,",28269,2
28270,Very poor quality!,28270,2
28270,"Only about $5.00 worth of fabric, loose ends on all seams and buttons and weak wide seams.",28270,2
28270,"I'd send it back, but it would cost more to send it back to China than it is worth!",28270,2
28271,Way too small.,28271,2
28271,Hurts my toes.,28271,2
28271,Sadly threw the packaging away or would send them back.,28271,2
28271,I wear a size 7 1/2 so they shouldn't have been tight because they're advertised as fitting up to size 9.,28271,2
28271,Don't recommend.,28271,2
28272,"When I got this shirt it was a size smaller than I ordered, but over all it is a cute shirt and looks good with everything, just wish it was the size I ordered.",28272,2
28273,It should be stated that these are not American sizes.,28273,2
28273,They are foreign sizes that run way to small.,28273,2
28273,I did talk to the company and got a little bit of a refund cause said it would cost to much to send back to China.,28273,2
28273,"I learned my lesson, won't be doing this again.",28273,2
28273,"Also, was not t-shirt material more like a spandex - yuck.",28273,2
28274,"Cute, but itty bitty teeny tiny.",28274,2
28274,Maybe 3 inches by 3 inches.,28274,2
28274,Just a fascinator clip.,28274,2
28274,Not a hat by any means.,28274,2
28275,To loose on top and too tight in the thighs with no give,28275,2
28276,"I love this, but going to try on once more, but may need to return, due to not busty enough for me.",28276,2
28277,Not that dark.,28277,2
28277,Cheap Halloween accessory type.,28277,2
28277,OK for a costume.,28277,2
28277,They are BIG.,28277,2
28278,"Very pretty,, but earring arrived broken",28278,2
28279,I got it earlier than expected which was great but the quality is not what it appears.,28279,2
28279,What looks like metal is plastic.,28279,2
28280,Cheaply made,28280,2
28281,"Much Too Large a Crown, gaudy.",28281,2
28282,Shirt is well made but the size is not proportional to the neck measurements.,28282,2
28282,Shirt sizes run much larger than conventional.,28282,2
28283,Fought for a six year old too big.,28283,2
28283,Read the print you only get one band,28283,2
28284,Head band too tight and too short.,28284,2
28284,Head feels like it's in a vice.,28284,2
28285,Really bad print - won't survive more than one or two washes,28285,2
28286,Very large brim on hat.,28286,2
28286,I just could not see his face and I'm not sure he could see in front of himself either.,28286,2
28286,It was sun protective but awkward hat.,28286,2
28287,Dress was pretty but to small,28287,2
28288,sent it back was way to small,28288,2
28289,"I ordered this for a trip to Europe but ended up returning it, it was a great idea but didn't fit enough to be worth the hassle of wearing something I would be worried might stretch out and fall off.",28289,2
28290,The fit is really weird.,28290,2
28290,"I'm a 34B, 125 lbs, 5'6"".",28290,2
28290,"It was too big around my torso but the ""cup"" barely fit over my boob.",28290,2
28290,It certainly wouldn't hold up a busty lady.,28290,2
28290,I have a few bralettes like this that I bought in shops where I live and they are different quality.,28290,2
28290,This one seemed to be cut oddly and cheaper made.,28290,2
28291,the stitching is HORRIBLE!!!!!,28291,2
28291,!,28291,2
28292,"Cons:
Expensive
Bad fit (my normal size was incredibly tight in the waist, size up was way too loose.)",28292,2
28292,Looks a little cheap.,28292,2
28292,STINKY!,28292,2
28292,"Even after washing and drying, they still smell like burning plastic.",28292,2
28292,"I'm not a smell sensitive person, but this is ridiculous.",28292,2
28292,"Pros:
Soft",28292,2
28293,Not a good fit for American men.,28293,2
28294,Bought this item for my daughter.,28294,2
28294,It was too small for her so I gave it to my niece.,28294,2
28294,The skirt underneath is extremely short and the overlay looks like more like a face veil.,28294,2
28294,It's much nicer in the picture than it is when you receive it.,28294,2
28295,My bride attempted to make things easier on us and pick a style online that we could all order for ourselves.,28295,2
28295,"There was an option to email the seller and provide my measurements, so I thought it was really pretty clear what my sizes are.",28295,2
28295,I was impressed that my dress arrived faster than I thought it would.,28295,2
28295,It's a beautiful dress but it was just... off.,28295,2
28295,If that makes sense?,28295,2
28295,"The bottom was way too long, and I don't understand that since I gave my measurements and height.",28295,2
28295,The middle fit well enough.,28295,2
28295,The top part was a disaster.,28295,2
28295,"You don't wear a strapless bra with it, and I was fine with that since there was plenty of support.",28295,2
28295,It was almost like they took a chest frame and sewed it in there haha.,28295,2
28295,I don't really know how to explain it.,28295,2
28295,"So after fooling with it, we got it zipped.",28295,2
28295,The thing was practically sideways on me.,28295,2
28295,The one shoulder had to practically leave the room to straighten up the rest of the dress.,28295,2
28295,You can't cut it and resew the top because of weird boob plate thing.,28295,2
28295,So basically the dress was useless to us and I decided to send it back.,28295,2
28295,Luckily the seller did say I could have a refund if I sent the dress back.,28295,2
28295,"This is where I should have been more careful on who I was ordering from, because in order to send it back - to China!",28295,2
28295,-  I'd need to pay $65!,28295,2
28295,"I'd already spent $100 on it, plus an additional $25 or 30 to rush it, and now another $65 to send it back?!",28295,2
28295,Plus they said it would be at least 5-6 weeks to receive it.,28295,2
28295,I said forget it.,28295,2
28295,That was the final straw for me.,28295,2
28295,I ended up just donating it to a daycare for dress-up play time.,28295,2
28296,Very disappointed with the quality.,28296,2
28296,"I also expected it to be much wider, however, its only about 3/4"" wide.",28296,2
28296,All of Te charms overlap each other.,28296,2
28296,"Also as others have stated, it I extremely fragile.",28296,2
28296,I had to fix it twice before I was able to put it on.,28296,2
28296,I gave up the third time it broke and just gave the charms to my daughter to her jewelry kit.,28296,2
28297,This outfit is very misleading.,28297,2
28297,It looks as if you're getting a romper or jumpsuit.,28297,2
28297,It's two separate pieces.,28297,2
28297,The shorts are very thin and sheer.,28297,2
28297,I guess you could wear them if you wore nude underwear...,28297,2
28297,But even then it's visually unappealing.,28297,2
28297,"Since the shorts are sheer, you can see the pocket material.",28297,2
28297,"However, I LOVE the top.",28297,2
28297,It isn't sheer at all and fits great!,28297,2
28297,It's white so it goes with everything.,28297,2
28297,It is a crop top so be aware of that.,28297,2
28297,The top was worth the $7 so I'm not too disappointed.,28297,2
28297,If you are buying this for the outfit- don't because you'll be disappointed.,28297,2
28298,"These are very pretty and sturdy, but my issue is that they are too large for my wrists and they aren't adjustable.",28298,2
28298,"It looks very cute when I have a binder on it, but as soon as I take the binder off to use in my hair, I have to also remove the bracelet because it falls off otherwise.",28298,2
28298,I just wish they were adjustable or had a connector.,28298,2
28299,love the belt but i bought it too big,28299,2
28300,gave it to a friend,28300,2
28301,Very shiny and looked cheap and plastic like.,28301,2
28301,Returned.,28301,2
28302,Nice coat but it was too small even though it was a 2X large.,28302,2
28303,very short,28303,2
28304,I don't like the fabric this tunic is made of.,28304,2
28304,"In the picture it wasn't obvious, but it is shiny, like the polyester of the 70's.",28304,2
28304,The fit is flattering and as expected but I can't get past the shiny fabric.,28304,2
28304,I will probably give it away.,28304,2
28305,better fit for kids.,28305,2
28305,also the front of the hat had indentions that weren't able to be fixed which caused the hat to not look appealing,28305,2
28306,not as bright as photo looks,28306,2
28307,hard to put on byyourself,28307,2
28308,If the brim wasn't so damn big it would be perfect,28308,2
28309,You can see right through this dress.,28309,2
28309,Colors are not as vibrant as expected & looks terrible on.,28309,2
28310,I guess you get what you pay for!,28310,2
28310,"It looks very cheap, the sparkle is way to artificial.",28310,2
28310,Defenitely made in China!,28310,2
28310,!,28310,2
28311,"Awesome design and idea, however basically the same experience as the other review; the design is an inch or two lower than appears in the picture, and is unfortunately more like a sleeveless t-shirt rather than a tank top, with the material over your shoulders being a few inches wide rather than an inch or two.",28311,2
28311,"I guess not terrifically surprising, as I assumed it's coming from some warehouse in China just banging these out, and the company seems to churn out a lot of ""custom"" printed shirts aka just massive number of possible pictures printed on a shirt",28311,2
28312,Fit as expected but not the same as the picture shown.,28312,2
28313,Returned.,28313,2
28313,"The neckline was too long and I don't mind that, if it was cut differently and better quality.",28313,2
28313,The hemming of this shirt makes it look cheaper.,28313,2
28313,"Bummed because I wanted it to work but not for the cost,",28313,2
28314,Not for a lady with a lot up top.,28314,2
28314,No padding or structure.,28314,2
28314,The design was super cute but I had to return it,28314,2
28315,Expected this item to be fitting (as the picture suggest) and it doesn't.,28315,2
28315,It fits too loose.,28315,2
28316,This vest is very cute but unfortunately it runs very small.,28316,2
28316,It would only fit a woman who is a Misses size 8 or smaller.,28316,2
28317,"Had to get it taken way in, and even after that it still just fit funny.",28317,2
28317,It took forever to get to me too.,28317,2
28318,"Nicely made, but way too small.",28318,2
28318,Will not purchase asian clothing again due to the poor sizing charts.,28318,2
28318,They are not even close to right.,28318,2
28319,is somewhat large,28319,2
28320,"strange fix x cross in back is very high on my solders, took a LONG time to arrive and connection of the straps to the fabric is scratchy AND the fabric is not 100% Polyester, feels more like cotton which is a plus but the over all fit is odd, I'm sad because I really wanted to love this shirt",28320,2
28321,There were burn type looking spots on it had to go get a new shirt the day of my wedding,28321,2
28322,"too long, and look different with picture",28322,2
28323,"Fits good, but feel cheaply made, I think you get what you pay for here.",28323,2
28323,Know you'll only get 3-5 wears out of it.,28323,2
28324,"It said to go up a size, I got a large and it is actually a large for men, not any smaller.",28324,2
28324,Material is nice but we cannot use it right now too big.,28324,2
28325,Cute and good quality especially for the price but unfortunately has a weird fit.,28325,2
28325,Bottom strip seems way too long and doesn't lay nicely on the neck.,28325,2
28325,It looks like it's a more appropriate length for having a charm or something.,28325,2
28325,I thought both strips were going to be pretty much the same length.,28325,2
28325,I will be returning.,28325,2
28326,"I got the size large because I am a d-cup with a slim waist, and it was too big.",28326,2
28326,Possibly this product just doesn't flatter women who have big busts.,28326,2
28326,In my opinion there was too much coverage by the neck and chest.,28326,2
28326,The material is nice just is sort of weird when you get to the black border on the neck.,28326,2
28327,A little small,28327,2
28328,Did not fit.,28328,2
28329,Much cheaper than I would have expected- I guess I got what I paid for,28329,2
28330,Ordered XXL/2XL.,28330,2
28330,"Doesn't fit me, but fits my 5' tall 120lb little sister.",28330,2
28330,Under questions and answers it states that 2XL=US 16-18.,28330,2
28330,Not even close!,28330,2
28330,Maybe 8-10 as my sister wears size 8.,28330,2
28330,Seemed to be made well which is why I gave it 2 stars.,28330,2
28330,Good thing my sister liked it so I didn't have to try to send it back!,28330,2
28331,"Material really thin,it start to tear after worn and first wash",28331,2
28332,Very long and very thin,28332,2
28333,It is nice looking but the fit is not good.,28333,2
28333,I would recommend ordering a size larger to feel comfortable.,28333,2
28334,Only really problem is they are small and material is slimy.,28334,2
28334,Which will make you sweat more in the desert.,28334,2
28335,need to exchange,28335,2
28336,I kinda wish it was smaller.,28336,2
28336,I figured small would be small enough but it wasn't.,28336,2
28336,Guess I needed a extra small..,28336,2
28337,"Too small, they constantly pop off the heel on a size 10 foot.",28337,2
28338,This is a good product if you have small boobies and big bottom.,28338,2
28338,I have big everything!,28338,2
28338,I'm a curvy size 16.,28338,2
28338,"Top does not cover the girls, but the bottom is a good fit.",28338,2
28339,I normally wear a small-occasionally I wear a medium.,28339,2
28339,I ordered the medium and it was way to small!,28339,2
28339,Cute but it runs VERY small,28339,2
28340,hope they don't break like my necklace,28340,2
28341,Cheap!!!,28341,2
28341,It discolored almost immediately!,28341,2
28342,Cheaply made in the bra.,28342,2
28343,junk took weeks to recieve not worth the wait,28343,2
28344,This toes ring constantly was loosing and turing upside down.,28344,2
28344,I had it for 2 months and it broke in half.,28344,2
28345,"Unfortunately, looks better online.",28345,2
28345,The setting is off center and crooked.,28345,2
28345,Hopefully it won't be too noticeable when worn.,28345,2
28345,Kind of disappointing.,28345,2
28346,maded cheaply,28346,2
28347,We had bought this same sign a few years back at a lower price.,28347,2
28347,The previous sign was metal & more detailed.,28347,2
28347,"This one was more cheaply made & plastic, but more expensive.",28347,2
28347,We like the sign & think it's funny.,28347,2
28347,We gave a few as gifts & those who received them were pleased.,28347,2
28348,The sizes are not what they were posted to be.,28348,2
28348,"The material seems like if i decide to wash it, it will be game over for the sweater.",28348,2
28348,I like the design and the look but i think it can use improvement.,28348,2
28349,Absolutely in love with this choker!,28349,2
28349,But I wore it once and the clasp broke off?!,28349,2
28349,It's not like this is even a dirt cheap product so I'd expect it to at least last a couple wears.,28349,2
28349,Super upsetting.,28349,2
28350,"The dress is too small , even the biggest size.",28350,2
28351,too small and uncomfortable,28351,2
28352,The use seems great but it's a pretty cheap material and very stiff and the inside color wasn't that great for me.,28352,2
28353,"larger gage than expected, very difficult to get ball on while in nose, looks too big.",28353,2
28353,overall not as satisfied as expected,28353,2
28354,"They moment I opened the package and was unscrewing the ball, the whole flower fell apart.",28354,2
28354,I didn't even have it for 10 seconds and it broke.,28354,2
28354,"Now I did super glue it back together, but to only find out it was to short to fit in my piercing.",28354,2
28355,"The color of the wine purse on my computer was an obvious purple, but when I received it, it was a disgusting red color.",28355,2
28355,"Needed more card holder pockets, only had four.",28355,2
28355,I returned it right away as the color was so bad and not what I thought it was advertised as.,28355,2
28356,"These are very thin, and not what I expected for the price at all.",28356,2
28356,Very dissapointed in the cheap quality of these.,28356,2
28357,"I ordered multiple of these, one after the other, in an attempt to get the correct size.",28357,2
28357,Each time we received the wrong product.,28357,2
28357,We eventually ran out of time to order another one before the occasion for wearing them.,28357,2
28357,"The sweater material was nice and the product was cute, if you can get the right size.",28357,2
28358,It's ok. Not as trendy as it looks in the picture,28358,2
28359,They're alright.,28359,2
28359,Cheap though.,28359,2
28360,"I was truly so excited to get these leggings, they are outrageously expensive in a boutique.",28360,2
28360,"The sizing is WAYYYY off, extremely small.",28360,2
28360,I got the largest size (I'm a size 10/US) and my sister tried them on (size 6/US) and they were uncomfortably tight on her.,28360,2
28360,Very disappointed!,28360,2
28361,This shirt could not have been a women's XL.,28361,2
28361,Maybe a kids XL.,28361,2
28361,Far too small and did not match the size chart measurements.,28361,2
28362,Didn't like the top too tight and below big,28362,2
28363,Armholes way too small,28363,2
28364,Top is huge.,28364,2
28365,Got this product on time.,28365,2
28365,"The angles are not as prominent as the photo, but that's not the worst.",28365,2
28365,"It said hypo allergenic when I bought it, but 30 minutes after putting it on, I could feel an allergic reaction coming on.",28365,2
28365,Very disappointing.,28365,2
28366,"I don't care for it only because it was too small, and it will cost me more to return it than what I paid for it.",28366,2
28367,I really wanted to like this bra.,28367,2
28367,It was stretchy and felt nice and was very soft but the straps basically come up under my arms and are just extremely uncomfortable.,28367,2
28367,"As soon as I put it on I was like ""oh cool..Oh wait..this sucks.."" They shoulder straps just fall off constantly.",28367,2
28367,It is just built improperly.,28367,2
28367,Straps are too far apart for comfort.,28367,2
28367,Put back in the box to return 2 minutes after I opened it.,28367,2
28368,The lunchbox on this backpack is glittery - I mean REALLY glittery.,28368,2
28368,So it is not really appropriate for a little boy.,28368,2
28368,It is weird.,28368,2
28368,"I think the gender norms when it comes to sparkle must be different in China... anyway the issue now is that my son loves the backpack, my husband hates the lunchbox and I can't fit his water bottle in the lunchbox.",28368,2
28368,Overall I would pass on this.,28368,2
28368,The 'lunchbox' is basically a detachable front pocket so that is weird too.,28368,2
28368,Bag seems like it will rip any second.,28368,2
28368,Sparkles flying everywhere.,28368,2
28368,aye yae yae.,28368,2
28369,Cheap,28369,2
28370,I am only giving this a two star because I received this damaged.,28370,2
28370,I was so excited to get this for my daughter.,28370,2
28370,"It's a beautiful outfit, but when I received it damaged it ruined it all for me.",28370,2
28370,The silver straps in the front were not sewn properly.,28370,2
28370,It took 2 minutes of trying to get it clasped for my daughter before it tore right out of the pink vest.,28370,2
28370,The back of the striped shirt had tons of string around the buttons as though it was sewn and just left.,28370,2
28370,I'm not a professional seamstress but I do sew things for a living.,28370,2
28370,This was horribly put together and I am very disappointed in seeing that.,28370,2
28370,"It fit my daughter very well, but I had to send it back because it would have taken me too much time to get it stitched back together properly.",28370,2
28370,"I really wish I had received this outfit without it so damaged, otherwise I would have kept it.",28370,2
28370,It was so adorable!,28370,2
28370,"Hopefully if you purchase this, you don't have the same issues I did.",28370,2
28370,"Or if you do, you can at least fix it by hand.",28370,2
28370,I have some Little Lass outfits for both of my girls and I've never had these issues.,28370,2
28370,"However, I felt it was necessary to share this with everyone!",28370,2
28371,While the case seems durable and strong I am highly disappointed in the quality of the Marauders Map printed on it.,28371,2
28371,The design is very blurry and hard to read.,28371,2
28371,Such a disappointment......,28371,2
28372,I bought the dress with the white background.,28372,2
28372,"Here are things you should know before buying:**

1) If you are between sizes go up a size.",28372,2
28372,"2) The print with the white background is slightly see-through
3) The material feels like a textured polyester-- there is an actual zigzag texture to it, not just the print.",28372,2
28372,It is also a little itchy.,28372,2
28372,"4) The collar and the back insert look like they were attached to change the original style-- the added pieces are VERY obvious and, though they do add a touch of modesty, it would have been cuter without them since they are added in a piecemeal way.",28372,2
28372,"(See 5)
5) No attention to the pattern is paid when cutting the pieces, so your dress might have a big flower over one breast and not on the other creating a lopsided appearance.",28372,2
28372,"6) This dress looks like it will be a swing skirt in the photos, but it is not.",28372,2
28372,"There are large pleats all around the waistline, rather than a circle skirt or a-line, that creates fullness at the waist.",28372,2
28372,7) It smelled strongly of chemicals when it arrived.,28372,2
28372,**The sellers have since contacted me and offered a partial refund.,28372,2
28372,"I had already returned the item for all the reasons above, but they asked that I changed my rating so I wouldn't affect their overall rating.",28372,2
28372,"I won't change my rating as it is based on the product, not the seller.",28372,2
28372,"The seller seems willing to work with customers, but I still can't recommend this particular product, BUT I would be willing to try other products from this vendor.",28372,2
28373,Smaller than expected.,28373,2
28374,"These stretch out while you're wearing them, they aren't black, they already have holes in them and they get pilly.",28374,2
28374,They came very late and are not good quality at all.,28374,2
28374,I shouldn't have trusted the reviews on these and most were bought at a discount,28374,2
28375,I normally wear a Large/size 12 and I ordered the large but this was very snug in the upper chest area.,28375,2
28376,way to small pretty but tiny im a thick girl,28376,2
28377,did not like the material,28377,2
28378,My bag came with a broken strap.,28378,2
28378,It seems like whoever inspected the bag for quality assurance noticed it because the shoulder strap was rigged and connected differently on the broken side.,28378,2
28379,"so thin they end up being all bent out of shape and the backs break off, when you try to straighten them, other wise they are pretty",28379,2
28380,Really cute..... but....,28380,2
28380,I ordered 3 total (one for each of my daughters) and one arrived without one of the stars.,28380,2
28380,"I didn't have time to wait for the return and replacement process, so i ordered a 4th.",28380,2
28380,The connection on the chain was broken on that one.,28380,2
28380,With the extra one I was able to make a third whole one.,28380,2
28380,Can't expect much more for the price.,28380,2
28381,Very small will only fit a small size person,28381,2
28382,Really hard to get on and off since the zipper stops at the completed collar instead of going through it.,28382,2
28382,Returned.,28382,2
28383,I gave them all to my daughter.,28383,2
28383,I wear a 1X or 2X  but these weren't X at all.,28383,2
28383,Buyer beware.,28383,2
28384,Ran very very small.,28384,2
28384,Can't wear the inside jacket part.,28384,2
28385,Flattering but slouchy and uncomfortable.,28385,2
28386,Swimsuit bled upon the first wash.,28386,2
28386,Disappointed.,28386,2
28387,It's doesn't for as pictures.,28387,2
28387,"It doesn't cut nearly as deep in the front as shown and fits much tighter, even though I ordered according to their sizing guide.",28387,2
28387,For only 12 dollars it could be worse but I certainly won't pay more for it,28387,2
28388,Very small,28388,2
28389,"The material on top does not look the same as the pic, it's cheap Lycra",28389,2
28390,slightly a little small then I thought it would be.,28390,2
28391,It's cute but runs way too small,28391,2
28392,"its not ankle lengh, it went to the knees.",28392,2
28392,Sent back,28392,2
28393,I am 5ft4 and bought small size.,28393,2
28393,"The product is way too long, pass my knee.",28393,2
28393,Does not look good like in the pic.,28393,2
28393,"Fabric looks kindda cheap, if u want too look little bit high end, always have to iron.",28393,2
28393,"DO NOT GET WHITE if anyone still insist to get this product for good price, it looks like doctor coat.",28393,2
28394,These sunglasses were so tight on my head and gave me a headache.,28394,2
28394,The hearts themselves were also huge and just overwhelming for my face.,28394,2
28394,Not at all what I was looking for or expecting.,28394,2
28395,The socks are small.they go only to the middle of my calf.,28395,2
28395,I'm 5'7 with a foot size 9 and don't fit well at all.actually cut some of the long strings that kept my calf from going in the sock.they are super thin and not very warm at all.,28395,2
28396,I have no words.,28396,2
28396,The item looks pretty much as it  does in the picture as far as craftsmanship but somehow..on me..it looks like I need to be swinging on a pole for singles.,28396,2
28396,I cant explain it.,28396,2
28397,The chain portion is cheaply made,28397,2
28398,Nice pants.,28398,2
28398,"Ordered size 2xl for fiance and they sent pants too small (removable tags said 2xl, inside pants tag said size large.)",28398,2
28398,Hoping they fulfill the correct order in a timely manner.,28398,2
28398,Disappointing.,28398,2
28399,Dislike,28399,2
28400,they seem like sunglasses for kids.,28400,2
28400,they are oddly small.,28400,2
28401,"Poorly made, handle unraveled almost immediately.",28401,2
28401,Loops inside also came a loose which defeated the purpose of the bag.,28401,2
28401,Not please at all with this purchase or product.,28401,2
28402,Embroidered area too wide.,28402,2
28402,Like a thinner look.,28402,2
28403,Shirt is cool but it seems to be more like a child's small then an adult small,28403,2
28404,"Very ""sticky"" finger pads.",28404,2
28404,"I'm going to keep them, because the are relatively warm (but mostly because I HATE AMAZON's return process), but I wouldn't recommend them!",28404,2
28404,!,28404,2
28405,it is more of a childs size rather then adult,28405,2
28406,Did not even look as picture.,28406,2
28407,The fabric is very thin.,28407,2
28407,I don't like it.,28407,2
28408,"I gave this top two stars because it's cute, but unfortunately doesn't fit.",28408,2
28408,I normally like to wear large tops so it's a little roomy but I can wear mediums but after reading some of the reviews about how small they run I ordered an x-large.,28408,2
28408,"Even at an x-large it's super small, it was like an x-small or small.",28408,2
28409,"I would describe them as too skimpy and thin, not too small.",28409,2
28409,Where are the old ones that covered more of the lower torso?,28409,2
28410,bought 2 sizes larger than usual and still way too small,28410,2
28411,"Not comfortable at all
Not happy
It's not smooth under clothes makes me lol bulkier",28411,2
28412,"Very cute dress on the hanger.you'll require help getting in/out of this, the corset lacing is the exact length when tightened but doesn't leave room for getting into it.",28412,2
28412,Essentially you have to be sewn into the dress.put it on then begin threading the lacing.,28412,2
28412,Also this material on the bodice is pretty stiff and scratchy.,28412,2
28412,"So, if you look like the model and don't care about comfort then this is the party dress for you!",28412,2
28413,Bleh...,28413,2
28413,It turns rusty,28413,2
28414,not what I expected,28414,2
28415,Pretty however hardly wear and it has very noticeable scratches on the metal?!,28415,2
28415,Not ok that the ring is this new and that happened.,28415,2
28416,Too conservative for me.,28416,2
28416,The model's hair and pose block the puffy-sleeved shoulders and the weird military strap that crosses the top of each shoulder.,28416,2
28416,"This, combined the high neckline creates an odd look.",28416,2
28416,Not recommended.,28416,2
28417,Very smelly and not comfortable a little big.,28417,2
28417,The straps by the armpit are so uncomfortable.,28417,2
28417,But the smell remained in the drawer i had it for like a week after i sent it back.,28417,2
28418,They seem to be somewhat cooling compared to other base layers I wear.,28418,2
28419,"I know these shirts were inexpensive, I bought three but I figured they would hold up better then they did.",28419,2
28419,"After 3-4 washing's the collars began turning up at the ends, this is very disappointing.",28419,2
28419,The washing directions were followed according to the label so that should not be the reason.,28419,2
28419,I will be donating these shirts very soon.,28419,2
28420,It's a very cute sweater but not very comfortable.,28420,2
28420,The sweater is very itchy and feels rough.,28420,2
28420,There is also no elasticity.,28420,2
28420,The fit is very boxy but like a short boxy so it fits weird.,28420,2
28421,The black mesh is see through and a lot shorter than expected.,28421,2
28421,The rest of the dress was very large.,28421,2
28422,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.,28422,2
28422,MATERIAL IS AWFUL!!!,28422,2
28422,!,28422,2
28423,Waaaaaay too small.,28423,2
28423,Had to return.,28423,2
28424,we ordered this item and found out the size you want to order is 4 sizes above what you normally wear.,28424,2
28424,the belt is very short and looks awful how we got it.,28424,2
28424,wish we had ordered it larger.,28424,2
28425,First off too small.,28425,2
28425,"It doesn't really look like the picture, the sleeves are like t-shirt sleeves, not loose.",28425,2
28425,The way it is cut you can't tell back from front and there is no tag.,28425,2
28425,It ripped in the armpit after one use and the material is not great.,28425,2
28425,"The elastic on the bottom is very tight and the shirt is not loose enough to fold over the bottom, looks very unattractive.",28425,2
28425,I would not recommend.,28425,2
28426,I ordered the 3-6 month size and when I took them out to wash them it was the wrong size.,28426,2
28426,It was the 0-3 month size!,28426,2
28427,"The first time I wore the, they ripped.",28427,2
28427,Not very happy :(,28427,2
28428,This is like a joke.,28428,2
28428,I will not even waste time to return it.,28428,2
28428,I love the soft material though.,28428,2
28428,Maybe I will fit in it one day or give it to someone.,28428,2
28429,"Sleeves don't sit right, they just bunch up.",28429,2
28429,This shirt is not flattering at all.,28429,2
28429,Sloppy looking.,28429,2
28430,The shirt itself besides the fitting is awesome.,28430,2
28430,"But my shoulders are too big for it, even tho its a large and im only 5""9 205.",28430,2
28431,"It's very cute, but it actually came broken.",28431,2
28431,I had to superglue it back together.,28431,2
28431,I had no time to exchange as it was for a party.,28431,2
28432,There was no push-up effect.,28432,2
28432,The beads were loose and falling out when I received it.,28432,2
28432,There is no way to adjust the straps so they could fall loose.,28432,2
28432,Somehow the design looks appealing but did not flatter me as much when I wore it.,28432,2
28432,"It may look good on some people, just not for me.",28432,2
28433,"THE EARRINGS WERE BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE POSTS WERE LARGER THAN MOST EARRINGS AND THEY IRRITATED MY EARS.",28433,2
28434,"Very low quality fabric and logo, the snaps don't close properly.",28434,2
28434,I ordered one and tried to return but never got a response from seller.,28434,2
28434,I contacted Amazon directly and I got a refund through them.,28434,2
28434,Very disappointed!,28434,2
28435,"I wanted to like it, as I loved the style and color, but it was disappointingly small for the stated size and the quality, in my opinion, just was not there.",28435,2
28435,I returned it.,28435,2
28436,Sizing (runs small),28436,2
28437,"Nice material, size chart was not correct, it was a child size -",28437,2
28438,Looks more line lingerie than a swimsuit cover up.,28438,2
28439,I purchase the extra large and it was actually really large.,28439,2
28439,I wish I ordered a large it would have been better.,28439,2
28439,The overall material/ fabric is ok. Cheep looking but alright.,28439,2
28440,Not a great quality shoe but I didn't expect it to be for the price.,28440,2
28441,No was to small and scratchy,28441,2
28442,I purchase this item because of the price but one size does not fit all.,28442,2
28442,This is cheap material and i can barely get it over my head.,28442,2
28443,"way too small, order like 2 sizes up.",28443,2
28443,the XL does not fit a US size 12-14.,28443,2
28444,Cheap fabric .,28444,2
28444,To short.,28444,2
28445,Center of the suit is much narrower than picture depicts.,28445,2
28446,These are cute little boots for fall or spring.,28446,2
28446,Definitely NOT Montana winter boots.,28446,2
28446,They fell apart the 3rd time she wore them.,28446,2
28447,This product was not as expected.,28447,2
28447,It did not fit me properly.,28447,2
28448,VERY CHEAP LOOKIMG,28448,2
28449,DOES NOT STAY IN PLACE,28449,2
28450,"Wanted to like these and probably would have kept them, but for the shoddy workmanship.",28450,2
28450,"I didn't expect much at this price point, but I did hope they'd be stitched together properly...",28450,2
28451,Its a pretty dress but after you wash it the color fades.,28451,2
28452,I washed it 2 times and some of the words are coming off..,28452,2
28452,I never dried it,28452,2
28453,"I thought this would be good for my 5'1""  petite frame, since people complained about it being short.",28453,2
28453,"It's an ok length... Actually longer than I was expecting, and didn't hug my figure in a flattering way.",28453,2
28453,"I think this would be best for a 5'3""-5'5"" small-medium woman with longer legs than torso.",28453,2
28454,They run small.,28454,2
28454,should order the next two size up.,28454,2
28455,Chain to short,28455,2
28456,Flimsier than it looks in the pics.,28456,2
28456,Also colour not as per picture - Lighter shade.,28456,2
28456,I'm not sure I'll be wearing it.,28456,2
28457,I don'tlike it,28457,2
28458,"Did not like the fit, tight in some places and loose on others.",28458,2
28459,I was a nice suit but sizing is small,28459,2
28460,It was made for someone with an extremely short torso.,28460,2
28460,"I'm already a short person, 5', and it was still way too short.",28460,2
28460,I used their size chart and the bust fit perfectly only if I pulled it up really far to where it was super tight on my crotch.,28460,2
28461,Product came folded and could not be normal.,28461,2
28462,Seems like it's about to fall apart.,28462,2
28463,"I ordered an XL and it fit more like M/L, was dissapointed considering I spent money on it.",28463,2
28464,"I thought I really would like this to wear with leggings, and the first time I wore it I reached for something at work and someone said ""you have a hole in your shirt"", so I looked under the arm and sure enough, there is a hole...so I thought ""I will just stitch it when I get home"" because I know things are sometimes overlooked...needless to say it is not even on a seam, just a hole in the fabric.",28464,2
28464,Disappointed that the quality was like this.,28464,2
28464,Wondering if I should send the others back before I try to wear them.,28464,2
28465,Gem fell off so easily,28465,2
28466,"Good material, but it is about 2 sizes smaller than listed.",28466,2
28467,the fit is just weird.,28467,2
28468,cheap looking,28468,2
28469,For my teenage daughter.,28469,2
28469,She loved it.,28469,2
28469,But the weld for the clasp broke first time she wore it.,28469,2
28470,"Too small, not a sweater, more I'm the lightweight jacket catagory",28470,2
28471,Broke the first day,28471,2
28472,Not like me,28472,2
28473,They run too small,28473,2
28474,"the dress does not fit like the picture at all, due to the liner, the dress keeps bulging in all the weird places and won't stay down, I personality did not like how it looked on me so I returned it.",28474,2
28475,While the case is beautiful and provides adequate cusion for my daughters laptop the strap that they show with the bag does not actually work.,28475,2
28475,There are no rings on the sides of the case for the strap to clip onto.,28475,2
28475,I am disappointed with this fact and have to sew my own small D-rings onto the bag so my daughter can use the shoulder strap to carry her laptop.,28475,2
28476,"Really pretty, however WAY, WAY to small.",28476,2
28476,I'm a medium.,28476,2
28476,"I ordered a large, just to be safe.",28476,2
28476,I couldn't even get them up over my thighs.,28476,2
28476,Disappointing glitter pants.,28476,2
28476,:(,28476,2
28477,I would have loved these pants if the sent them in the right size they sent a medium when I wanted a small and I think the small may even be too big.,28477,2
28477,They fit really big.,28477,2
28477,I am returning them andat not buy again.,28477,2
28478,Does not stretch.,28478,2
28479,too much depth to insole hope your shoes are too big,28479,2
28480,"Cheap, waste of money.",28480,2
28480,Quality sucks.,28480,2
28480,Rolls up.,28480,2
28480,Material is see through.,28480,2
28480,Unsupportive.,28480,2
28480,Would have to get a swimsuit and sew this on the outside of it as it's just material.,28480,2
28481,too small,28481,2
28482,Like the concept but do not stay in place on my ears.,28482,2
28482,They were just hanging down,28482,2
28483,"Beautiful colors but way, way too small.",28483,2
28483,I'm keeping it to give to someone as a present.,28483,2
28483,"If you buy it, get at least a size larger, possibly 2 sizes.",28483,2
28483,The tiny little model is probably wearing a large.,28483,2
28483,"(Just kidding, but that is how it feels.)",28483,2
28484,Gave it away to a co-worker - extremely small for an XL,28484,2
28485,It fell apart after two washes.,28485,2
28485,"I could tell it was fragile, and washed it in a lingerie bag, and hung it up to dry.",28485,2
28485,It unraveled the bottom and one of the sleeves.,28485,2
28485,"I crochet, so I was able to fix it, but it was not something I expected for a sweater that  I paid over $10 for.",28485,2
28485,I could have received much better quality from a big box store.,28485,2
28486,DONT LIKE THE MATERAL,28486,2
28487,Too small for a Medium,28487,2
28488,I have had this bead on my Pandora braclet for only two weeks and I have already lost many stones.,28488,2
28488,The bead was very beautiful when it arrived but does not shine like it used to now that stones are missing.,28488,2
28489,Swimsuit was to short on my body.,28489,2
28489,I am 5'7 and have a longer torso so it did not work well.,28489,2
28489,I ended up returning it.,28489,2
28490,Super cute bathing suit but doesn't fit like the size chart states.,28490,2
28490,I ordered an XL.,28490,2
28490,The top fits like.,28490,2
28490,Medium and the bottoms fit like a large.,28490,2
28490,I could make the bottoms work but there is no way I can fit in the top.,28490,2
28491,The count was accurate but the product was very cheap but for the price it is what it is,28491,2
28492,To small,28492,2
28493,I wanted to love this blouse.,28493,2
28493,I love the color.,28493,2
28493,I ordered a 2x and I wear a 2x.,28493,2
28493,It's too small.,28493,2
28493,The band is tight on my hips and the draping doesn't lay correct because of the poor sizing.,28493,2
28493,The draping in the front is not hemmed so you have a raw edge for everyone to see.,28493,2
28493,Depending on your preference it might be too thin for your tastes.,28493,2
28493,"The fabric is a mesh style, which would be very nice in the summer, not so much in an air conditioned office.",28493,2
28493,On the positive I loved the color.,28493,2
28493,It's a beautiful and bright color.,28493,2
28493,I really wish this fit.,28493,2
28493,I'd deal with the raw edge and thinness if it fit.,28493,2
28493,I am returning this.,28493,2
28494,Nice simple hat for a child but it's much larger than advertised.,28494,2
28494,Maybe my child can wear it in two years!,28494,2
28495,"The ""pouch"" which is not really a pouch, is just a small triangle, second layer of material inside, more like a bib.",28495,2
28495,"There's no ""cupping"" action go on, if you understand the reference.",28495,2
28496,I am a US size 10-12 so I ordered an XL after reading the reviews.,28496,2
28496,It's STILL too small!,28496,2
28496,The actual dress looks NOTHING like the picture on here.,28496,2
28496,I will keep and pass on to my sister simply because it isn't worth returning.,28496,2
28496,But do yourself a favor and keep looking; don't order this dress.,28496,2
28496,Also - I won't order anything again that says it's coming from China- just not worth it.,28496,2
28497,Material on the palm side is t-shirt thin so wouldn't prevent baby from scratching face through it.,28497,2
28497,"The pattern design is simply another t-shirt layer on the top-side, so 2 layers on the top of hand and 1 layer on bottom of hand  The packaging was beautiful and its presentation would look nice as a gift.",28497,2
28497,"However I returned this as it wasn't suitable for the functions I was looking for, which was thicker knit mittens to: 1) keep baby from scratching face, and 2) keep baby's hands warm while he sleeps.",28497,2
28498,"I like Incredisocks, but this version does not stay up on my ankle due to lack of elastic, apparently.",28498,2
28498,These sag.,28498,2
28498,Annoying.,28498,2
28498,I believe the type I should have bought are the compression socks.,28498,2
28498,I'm buying those next.,28498,2
28499,To each her own....,28499,2
28499,I did not like the fit and the material is awful.,28499,2
28499,"I wanted a jean dress, this is not one at all.",28499,2
28500,Terrible if you are size 10-12 or smaller.,28500,2
28500,Much too big.,28500,2
28500,Flat like a board.,28500,2
28500,Visible under your clothes.,28500,2
28500,Sticks out and looks ridiculous.,28500,2
28501,Just received.,28501,2
28501,The Prong came off completely and would not change the time!,28501,2
28501,The glass looks like plastic as well,28501,2
28502,"I would have given it a higher rating were it not for the setting, which has either tarnished or the silver color coating has worn off.",28502,2
28503,I love it.,28503,2
28503,But I bought it a size up and it was still small.,28503,2
28503,"Recommend at least 2 sizes up, if anyone wants to buy.",28503,2
28504,"The actual dress wasn't far off from the photo, I noticed some inconsistencies when it came to the cut, but overall it was pretty accurate.",28504,2
28504,"When I put the dress on, I liked how it looked and it fit well.",28504,2
28504,My only problem with this dress is the quality.,28504,2
28504,"This dress is made of a plasticky polyester type material, similar in feel to what a windbreaker is made of.",28504,2
28504,The fabric is so thin and cheap that the dress is see through.,28504,2
28504,"When I put it on, I could see everything straight through it.",28504,2
28504,"Because of this, I had to return it.",28504,2
28504,"Nice dress, but very poor quality.",28504,2
28505,A bit disappointed...the skirt is too short...,28505,2
28506,Purchased last minute and the romper is absolutely adorable but the quality is awful.,28506,2
28506,It had a snag on the front.,28506,2
28506,I afraid to pull it off in case it unraveled even more.,28506,2
28506,The bottom button on the romper was missing.,28506,2
28506,I didn't catch it prior to his actual baptism day so there was nothing I could do last minute.,28506,2
28506,He ended up wearing it all crazy.,28506,2
28506,"Make sure if you purchase this product, you examine it as soon as it arrives.",28506,2
28507,Had to donate it.,28507,2
28508,Everything fit but the arms where to small.,28508,2
28509,Way to big and crazy long.,28509,2
28510,"Bought it September of 2015, the clicking mechanism inside the belt broke yesterday.",28510,2
28510,The parts that felt out looked like plastic so it makes sense that it only lasted a year.,28510,2
28510,I loved the belt but I would not buy again because it needs to last longer than a year.,28510,2
28511,I think these would work fine out in the cold.,28511,2
28511,However that's if you can get past the tight pinch on the ears.,28511,2
28511,"Also, they are not soft on the ears at all.",28511,2
28511,Very uncomfortable.,28511,2
28511,Unfortunately I missed my opportunity to return these.,28511,2
28511,If I still could I definitely would.,28511,2
28512,It fits OK but you can completely see my bra through it even oh you can't tell in the photo and it was supposed to be a deeper red but it almost looks pink,28512,2
28513,Not for taller ladies.,28513,2
28513,Barely fits at all.,28513,2
28514,The plastic is coming apart on the front and sides.,28514,2
28515,"The fabric design is awesome, and the fabric itself is light but very nice.",28515,2
28515,"However, the dress pattern is terrible.",28515,2
28515,"There are enormous gaps at the arm openings in front-- when I tried it on, you could see the sides of my bra.",28515,2
28515,I haven't decided if I will return it or pay someone to put darts in the sides.,28515,2
28516,Nice top but the so-called asian measurements you're supposed to go by are SO WRONG.,28516,2
28516,"I looked up my bust and waist size, ordered the corresponding size, and it's huge on me and shows my bra straps.",28516,2
28516,Bummer...,28516,2
28517,Bad quality and way to small I ordered a medium looks like a xs,28517,2
28518,Runs HUGE,28518,2
28519,The design of the glasses look completely different and they aren't dark as people make them seem.,28519,2
28519,"Super dark means , pitch black.",28519,2
28519,"Anytime someone can see your eyes through sunglasses, they aren't dark.",28519,2
28520,"I ordered two different pair of these, for whatever reason the left shoe shape is really off like something was piled on top of it.",28520,2
28520,This made it feel funny on my foot and made it fit loose too.,28520,2
28520,"The second pair was the same, but the shape wasn't as bad as the first pair and the fit was slightly loose.",28520,2
28520,"I just decided to keep the second pair, didn't want to go through the hassle of exchanging them again to end up with the same results.",28520,2
28520,I'll just go to the store and purchase them from now on.,28520,2
28521,Ordered it for my daughter for a Mother Daughter Tea and it was to small for her.,28521,2
28521,I think i should have ordered a larger size.,28521,2
28521,I requested a return and it was no problem.,28521,2
28521,I got my label and will be sending it back.,28521,2
28521,There was no questions asked.,28521,2
28522,I didn't like how it keeps getting wrinkly and  that I have to keep pulling it down.,28522,2
28522,It doestrogen help with your posture but for anything else no.,28522,2
28522,It disn't help me lose the weight.,28522,2
28522,I should get my refund back .. it was waste of time.,28522,2
28523,very skimpy material.,28523,2
28523,shorter than expected.,28523,2
28523,Unable to wear.,28523,2
28524,It doesn't fit like in the picture.,28524,2
28524,The silver hoop part hangs down.,28524,2
28524,:(,28524,2
28525,It said it had a stop watch as well as a watch.,28525,2
28525,It is only a digital watch.,28525,2
28526,"Nice romper, I guess, but doesn't look too much like the picture, but I didn't mind since it looked cute anyway.",28526,2
28526,"The materials were weird, but what can you do...?",28526,2
28526,"I'm 5'9 and got myself an extra large, but the way it fit looked pornographic honestly... doesn't cover anything.",28526,2
28527,Too short.,28527,2
28527,I bought it for my daughter but it is extremely short.,28527,2
28527,I will be returning.,28527,2
28528,Drawstring fit weird,28528,2
28529,"very poor quality, I will not buy anything from this vendor again",28529,2
28530,DISAPPOINTED!,28530,2
28531,It's made very cheap and way too small!,28531,2
28532,I usually wear an XL in shirts (Im a sz 10/12 and wear 36DD bra) so I ordered an XL.,28532,2
28532,It fits like a child's XL!!!,28532,2
28532,Its way too short.,28532,2
28532,"Its cute, but I gave it to my 12 year old niece!",28532,2
28533,Cute but runs very small,28533,2
28534,"After 1-2 washes, these panties don't hold up the weight.",28534,2
28534,It's so loose that it doesn't do the job.,28534,2
28535,a khute little dress still just too large,28535,2
28536,I wish it worked for me... it seems cute.,28536,2
28536,"But the shoulders padding are weird, i wish there was any, they are on the top of the jsckets at a weird angle.",28536,2
28536,And the holes for the arms is to small.,28536,2
28536,So tight.,28536,2
28536,But after that it was cute,28536,2
28537,Completely fell apart after a month of use,28537,2
28538,The top of this garment was too small and the bottom was an o.k fit!,28538,2
28538,The color was exactly what I expected....overall the outfit itself looked really cheap!,28538,2
28539,Some of the lights have already quit working.,28539,2
28539,Only had the shoes for a week.,28539,2
28539,Somewhat disappointed,28539,2
28540,It does not stay fasten.,28540,2
28540,The magnetic does stay put.,28540,2
28541,"Looks cute, but the quality is VERY cheap so beware.",28541,2
28541,I touched the material with an iron on mid-heat for all of two seconds and it burned a hole straight through the outer material.,28541,2
28541,Super disappointing.,28541,2
28541,Product has no stretch what so ever.,28541,2
28542,My son wears 3t sometimes 4t.,28542,2
28542,This was a 3t and it was to big.,28542,2
28543,I think these would work fine out in the cold.,28543,2
28543,However that's if you can get past the tight pinch on the ears.,28543,2
28543,"Also, they are not soft on the ears at all.",28543,2
28543,Very uncomfortable.,28543,2
28543,Unfortunately I missed my opportunity to return these.,28543,2
28543,If I still could I definitely would.,28543,2
28544,It fit fine but the yellow was very see through and the embroidery was fraying .,28544,2
28544,But for the price it's not that bad .,28544,2
28545,"Very cheap, not anywhere near the quality I expected.",28545,2
28546,Long enough but elastic around the waist does not keep them up.,28546,2
28547,After receiving my package I love the purse I had one problem one of the zippers were damaged because I needed it for traveling I decided to keep it because I have no time to return it.,28547,2
28548,Very Plastic feeling.,28548,2
28548,Arrived very wrinkled.,28548,2
28549,Odd fit,28549,2
28550,I try it and it's a little bit small in the middle.,28550,2
28551,They are nice and warm but WAY thicker than I would like and they leave tiny fibers EVERYWHERE all over your hands and everything.,28551,2
28551,"They also fuzzed out immediately and look awful now, not the sleek cable knit pictured.",28551,2
28552,"As far as look they were perfect, and even though the size was stated I was still very shocked at how big they were.",28552,2
28552,I will not be wearing these unless an ocassion for eccentric jewelry arrises.,28552,2
28553,The are really see through.,28553,2
28553,"I know they said to expect any color but I didn't get one average color, all pastel colors...",28553,2
28553,Disappointed,28553,2
28554,"My wife liked them at first, but then the bow fell off one and the other seemed to stop working on touch screens.",28554,2
28554,"Too bad too, cause they worked really well at first.",28554,2
28554,They seem cheaply made.,28554,2
28555,Um.,28555,2
28555,"I'm not sure who they are basing measurements on, but this top was entirely too small.",28555,2
28555,Back it went.,28555,2
28556,Material is super thin and see through.,28556,2
28556,I ordered an xl for a maternity shirt (7 months Preggo)!,28556,2
28556,And only wore it once.,28556,2
28556,It practically shrinks to nothing after you wash and dry it.,28556,2
28557,"The package may be labeled ""nude.""",28557,2
28557,"However, the ankle highs are NOT in any way ""nude.""",28557,2
28557,Beige maybe but definitely not nude.,28557,2
28558,Recieved 2 pairs of the tiger eye and 1 pair of the white when I ordered this...,28558,2
28558,"Disappointed because I really wanted the green ones, which is why I decided on this set.",28558,2
28558,It was my first and probably last purchase from Mystic Metals.,28558,2
28559,"image misleading, full net at the back",28559,2
28560,Pants and white under shirt fit exact but white cover up was too small.. Hard to get over my little girls head and very tight on her arms..,28560,2
28561,"Style is perfect but not form fitting, material is too stretchy like that of cheap yoga pants.",28561,2
28562,"The earrings picture do not do justice to how large the pearls actually are, in fact, the pearls are so large and unproportional that the earrings are top heavy.",28562,2
28562,"This causes the earrings to pull forward on one's ear, instead of pulling down.",28562,2
28562,I strongly recommend the seller include a picture of the earrings profile that demonstrates how oddly shaped these earrings are.,28562,2
28562,The picture currently available is not representative of the delivered product.,28562,2
28563,"The dress is very nice, but I went according to their measurements and it needs another 2-3 inches around.",28563,2
28564,Sizing is off.,28564,2
28564,I couldn't fit this at all.,28564,2
28564,Huge disappointment because it is so cute.,28564,2

28566,This is not a hat.,28566,2
28566,It doesn't even have a liner inside of the hat.,28566,2
28566,It made of multiple strings that your finger can go through it .,28566,2
28566,I will return it .,28566,2
28566,Looks very good in picture .,28566,2
28567,It is knitted so loosely that it is barely usable.,28567,2
28567,I tried the hat once but  with the loose knitting it really does not offer much protection.,28567,2
28567,Will go into the goodwill box soon.,28567,2
28568,Broken Nose Piece,28568,2
28569,I won't buy these again.,28569,2

28570,15 minutes.,28570,2
28570,The tiny ring holding the toe loop let go.,28570,2
28570,"Instead of returning the item, I will repair the loop myself.",28570,2
28570,It is a cute accessory that I look forward to wearing longer.,28570,2

28572,Disappointed.,28572,2
28573,This brooch is very large.,28573,2
28573,It's pretty.,28573,2
28573,I'm sending it back because the class was loose and it won't stay on.,28573,2
28574,"Very, very thin material & VERY small",28574,2
28575,I was really disapointed because it said plus size.,28575,2
28575,this runs really small.,28575,2
28576,The belt is too high up!,28576,2
28576,I'm going to have to cut it off or take it to a seamstress to fix.,28576,2
28577,"Although it was too small, I was able to gift it to my teenage (19) niece who loves the outfit.",28577,2
28577,Unfortunately it wasn't for adult size (size 8).,28577,2
28578,"The socks are beautiful, but have a much more synthetic feel rather than cotton.",28578,2
28578,They also run small.,28578,2
28578,They seem much more like women's socks.,28578,2
28579,Not true to size.,28579,2

28583,"I buy a xxl, cause I'm 5'10"" no way does it come close to being long enough!",28583,2
28583,Not to mention I ordered the pink print and got a black one instead.,28583,2
28583,"Such a bummer, it was very pretty.",28583,2
28584,"It's a very pretty top, however, beware of the ""One size fits all"" if you're a little busty or have a little bit of a pooch in the stomach.",28584,2
28584,It will fit too tight.,28584,2
28584,"It would be nice if you could order this blouse in the size that you specifically need and not ""one size for all"" because everyone clearly aren't ONE size.",28584,2
28585,They are cute until you try to wear them.,28585,2
28585,The charms fall off so easily and when they arrived four charms were already off,28585,2

28587,I like the look of the shoes.,28587,2
28587,They're great for dress shoes but I wush they would make them more truer to size.,28587,2
28588,"Cheap quality, it ripped right away in the back.",28588,2
28589,Nothing stretchy here.,28589,2
28589,Had to dismantle it to make it work.,28589,2
28589,Not worth the trouble.,28589,2
28589,Save yourself the trouble and buy a ribbon and stapler.,28589,2

28605,It is a great item but order three times larger.,28605,2
28606,Had to give it away,28606,2
28607,"The straps are just ribbon, so if you want it to stay on your head, you need to tie it super tight.",28607,2
28607,"It also didn't curve to the shape of my face, so in order for me to tie it where it was tight enough, I would have had to hold the mask and get my husband to tie it in the back.",28607,2
28607,"I bought this for Halloween, but never used it.",28607,2
28607,I just painted my face instead.,28607,2
28608,Very flimsy and cheap feeling.,28608,2
28608,Would not recommend or buy again.,28608,2
28609,Does not look anything like the picture!,28609,2
28609,Way to small as well.,28609,2

28612,it is not worth the price but will not send it back...,28612,2
28613,The quality isn't the best,28613,2
28614,The colors are really dull and faded looking; nothing like the photo.,28614,2
28614,"And the print has the word Paris in it, but it is printed backwards.",28614,2
28614,Lol.,28614,2
28614,Must be made by people who don't know the alphabet.,28614,2
28614,"Aside from that, it's a nice shirt, just not worth $40.",28614,2
28615,Not thrilled with these- way to large.,28615,2
28615,"They are long, which is good but to make them more comfortable I have to hike them way up and its not flattering.",28615,2

28616,Material is nice.,28616,2
28616,Had read it was tight in bust so ordered a size up.,28616,2
28616,Still tight in bust but way too large in hips and pointed hem edges looks like just a bunch of material around me.,28616,2
28616,Sending back.,28616,2
28617,didn't last after a couple washes,28617,2
28618,Only had this two months maybe even shorter period of time.,28618,2
28618,"Zipper kept sticking, then got permanently stuck.",28618,2
28618,I had to use scissors to cut the material along side the zipper to get my personal items out of the wallet.,28618,2
28619,This is pretty but has tarnished after wearing a few times.,28619,2
28620,Looks terrible on me.,28620,2
28620,not great quality.,28620,2
28620,Pass on it.,28620,2
28621,They hurt after 30 minutes of wearing them.,28621,2

28627,"The ring does look like the picture, but the shape is a little off when worn.",28627,2
28627,It is a pretty piece of jewelry but useless if one can't even wear it.,28627,2
28628,not true to size.,28628,2
28628,appeared to be a BIG shirt.,28628,2
28628,form fitting,28628,2
28629,Cheap material and comes waaaaayyy huge.,28629,2
28629,Unlike everything else on here that u order a size up you need to order down 2 sizes.,28629,2
28629,It is pretty much made of sheer curtain like material and is see through.,28629,2
28630,"Looks good on wrist, but clasp broke after 2 days.",28630,2
28631,The dress was way too long in length especially considering we ordered a small.,28631,2
28631,It was twice the length of the same type of dresses in the store.,28631,2

28635,Top was ridiculously small.,28635,2
28635,bottoms were fairly see through... depending on the destination that's a good thing or a bad thing.. haha,28635,2

28637,"I'm only a 34b, so I don't understand what kind of body this bikini is designed for, but it definitely didn't work for me.",28637,2
28637,"The design is cute, but I probably won't be keeping it.",28637,2
28637,"If you've got small breasts and big butts, maybe these may work for you, but it's a no for me.",28637,2
28638,I am a 34C in Victoria Secret bras so I ordered a medium and was definitely let down.,28638,2
28638,The top is a tad larger than I would have liked it to be and the bottoms are wayyyy too tight!,28638,2
28638,"The cups of the top piece are stitched in an odd way, so if the top is too loose then it looks like you can see nipples because of the ""gappy-ness"" that occurs because you're not filling out the cups.",28638,2
28638,"Also, you can see the outline of the padding through the cups when it is reversed to the pink side while you're wearing it.",28638,2
28638,There is also uneven stitching of the bands in-between the cups as shown in one of my photos.,28638,2
28638,The only pluses i have about this suit are that it has been made with a nice material and the colors are vibrant.,28638,2
28638,"One LAST thing, don't let the title ""PUSH UP TOP"" fool you because there is definitely no ""pushing"" noticeable.",28638,2
28639,Cheap for the price,28639,2
28640,material is not good.,28640,2
28640,my daughter is thin but this came out (and we used the measurement table) way tooo small,28640,2
28641,I ordered an XL (I normally wear a medium)-  I ended up giving this shirt to an 11 year old girl because it is tiny.,28641,2
28642,"It is a very cute shirt, but VERY WIDE!",28642,2
28642,I usually wear an XS/S so I bought a SMALL.,28642,2
28642,It seems like it is actually a Large for the width of it.,28642,2
28643,ran small but I did love the color and the sleeves!,28643,2
28643,just wish it would have fit.,28643,2
28644,Too short to easily grasp the earring and back to screw the back on.,28644,2
28644,I needed help putting the earring in and taking it out.,28644,2
28644,The second earring I tried would not go through the piercing and caused the ear to bleed.,28644,2
28644,I don't feel like bothering to send the product back for a refund.,28644,2
28644,These were cheap for a reason.,28644,2
28645,This romper was true to size and fit my son as expected.,28645,2
28645,"BUT, after the first wash the buttons to close the bottom feel off.",28645,2
28645,I knew I was purchasing this item for cheap so I'm not too disappointed but beware.,28645,2
28646,These sweatpants are huge and bulky.,28646,2
28646,Order at least one size down.,28646,2
28647,"I ordered a medium, as that it what I usually wear according to the measurements.",28647,2
28647,The top was definitely too small.,28647,2
28647,"Would fit someone who wears size small, maybe.",28647,2
28647,Bottoms fit ok. Not too too small.,28647,2
28647,Very disappointed because I loved the look of this suit.,28647,2
28647,Totally cute :-(  I returned it.,28647,2
28647,Disclosure:  I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.,28647,2
28648,Cute jumper - but doesn't resemble the photo.,28648,2
28648,"I typically wear a size 4/small, but would need an XL in this product.",28648,2
28648,"The colors are much brighter than they appear here, losing the ""boho""-trending look.",28648,2
28648,"Not my favorite, will be returning.",28648,2
28649,Not into leaves.,28649,2
28650,Must be in Asian sizes  Liked the whole look but even a xxl won't fit an average 10-12 woman.,28650,2
28651,Can barely get them over my foot.,28651,2
28652,stone was loose in the setting,28652,2
28653,The longer I wore it the more i was worried it would rip right off of me,28653,2
28654,Fit on this dress was bizarre.,28654,2
28654,"The fabric bunches up on the thighs and the straps on this dress were completely misshapen, parts of it wide and then really thin.",28654,2
28654,I was so excited for this dress but it was just not well made.,28654,2
28654,"The return process has been easy, though so I don't blame the seller.",28654,2
28655,"Heads up, this product runs small!",28655,2
28655,"Do refer to the sizing chart, but keep in mind to get a size or two larger than expected.",28655,2
28655,"I bought an XL because of my 5'7"" height and 40"" hips, and even so, the swimsuit cut into my rear unattractively and the shoulder straps were incredibly tight!",28655,2
28655,"Despite my troubles with the size, the product itself is attractive.",28655,2
28655,The hip bands are vibrantly colored.,28655,2
28655,"If you're lucky enough to get a size that fits you well, you'll definitely get compliments at the poolside :)",28655,2
28656,Too small and cheaply made,28656,2
28657,"Much, much larger than expected.",28657,2
28658,Cheap looking,28658,2
28659,These are too short.,28659,2
28660,The stitching it not centered on the hat.,28660,2
28660,Obviously not much QC.,28660,2
28660,Not the type of product I would like to see representing the next president.,28660,2
28660,"You can see in the pictures that the ""M"" in make is 5/8"" away from the stitching and the ""A"" at the end of America is 1 3/8"" away from the stitching.",28660,2
28661,I'm not a big guy.,28661,2
28661,I like my shirts to fit loosely and this does not.,28661,2
28661,Any other xl does.,28661,2
28662,I've bought 2 pairs of these over the last year.,28662,2
28662,My first pair was absolutely fantastic and still holding strong to this day.,28662,2
28662,The second pair was a big let down.,28662,2
28662,When I went to put them on I heard a cracking sound from the elastic.,28662,2
28662,(The sound old dried out elastic makes).,28662,2
28662,"Also, these didn't hold their shape much.",28662,2
28662,The became super loose in the crotch area and keep falling down.,28662,2
28662,I've only had these ones for about 2 months and they're already looking worse then my ones I got over a year ago.,28662,2
28662,I don't know if I received a bad pair but it makes me not want to buy another...,28662,2
28663,The reviews are too kind.,28663,2
28663,"Way too short, fits weird around the armpits and chest area, thick, uncomfortable...",28663,2
28663,I can't even imagine working out in something this uncomfortable.,28663,2
28663,I will stick to my $4 Wal-Mart Faded Glory shirts that fit perfectly and are super comfy for wearing by themselves or layering.,28663,2
28663,"I tried layering with these (hoping I could get some use out of them) but they were so bulky and thick, it was terrible.",28663,2
28663,"Plus, I kept pulling on the bottom of it, trying to get comfortable.",28663,2
28663,The only positives to these is they probably last a while (even if you actually end up wearing them) because they seem to be well made and I really liked the colors.,28663,2
28664,Its okay.,28664,2
28664,The picture makes it look better than it is.,28664,2
28664,"If i knew what is actually was like, i wouldnt have bought is.",28664,2
28665,"I like the socks, I just can't wear them because they are tiny and cut the circulation off if I try to squeeze into them.",28665,2
28666,"shirt in the picture looks to be fitted, but the actual size is quite baggy.",28666,2
28666,I ordered a size larger because of the picture misrepresented the item.,28666,2
28667,Although the skirt is beautiful it is cut really small - the one size fit all will fit no larger than a size 8 and it is not long but comes just above the knee,28667,2
28668,I love the skirt but it is cut to small to zipper.,28668,2
28668,The material is nice.,28668,2
28668,I usually wear a small/ size 2 ( size 5 in juniors) pants and there is about a 4 inch gap between the sides of the waist band.,28668,2
28669,"Very cute and good quality, but made for women with no boobs at all.",28669,2
28670,"I loved this saying, but yhe material is so thin it can not be used as a bib, everythinf goes right through it",28670,2
28671,"The fabric is kind of stiff, and the pattern reminds me of my grandmother.",28671,2
28671,"I'll keep it, maybe it will get softer with age.",28671,2
28672,"If you have boobs, good luck fitting in this.",28672,2
28673,"I don't like the material much , I wish it's better quality",28673,2
28674,It didn't look like the picture.,28674,2
28674,It was a different color and it fits tight in the arms.,28674,2
28674,It also had a stale scent.,28674,2
28674,I returned it for a refund.,28674,2
28675,Loved the bags color and size... but the zipper broke first zip;(,28675,2
28676,I bought 2 of these.,28676,2
28676,"One fit perfectly, the other one, same size, only came to the tops of my thighs.",28676,2
28676,"Apparently, you're just taking a shot in the dark as to what you will actually get.",28676,2
28676,"If they fit like they should, I would be really happy with them.",28676,2
28676,I gave them to my 13 year old daughter since she is several inches shorter and they actually covered what they should on her.,28676,2
28677,The material was different from what I thought it would be.,28677,2
28677,It is completely spandex and shows everything.,28677,2
28678,The bar is too short to handlel,28678,2
28679,This dress is too long!,28679,2
28680,The fit of the dress was great but the material was way too thin for my taste.,28680,2
28681,Way too small!,28681,2
28681,!,28681,2
28682,I wanted to love this shirt.,28682,2
28682,It seemed perfect for summer.,28682,2
28682,But when it came in it was just too tight.,28682,2
28682,"I ordered the XL to allow for enough room to be a little loose, but it was too small right out of the pack.",28682,2
28682,I had to send it back unfortunately.,28682,2
28682,I would love to have this style in a little looser fit.,28682,2
28683,Very short and tight and mafdmafde of polyester,28683,2
28684,Sadly this swim suit didn't fit.,28684,2
28684,I got a medium but it was way too large i had to return it.,28684,2
28684,I'm usually a small/medium but I got a medium because I thought since it's a one piece a small might be too tight.,28684,2
28684,A medium was HUGE and didn't even cover my nips.,28684,2
28684,Disappointed,28684,2
28685,this was way too big for me,28685,2
28686,"Sadly, this shirt did not fit as I expected it to.",28686,2
28686,It was much too small!,28686,2
28686,"I love the design but due to the fit, I had to give it away.",28686,2
28686,"I wear a large, typically so, that's what I ordered but, I should have ordered maybe, a XXL.",28686,2
28687,Cute sweater but it stinks,28687,2
28688,"Look super cute, however my toes popped through the lace in every pair after one wear... makes sense, I blame myself for not realizing that would happen.",28688,2
28689,Start falling apart after 2nd washing.,28689,2
28690,"When I got my plugs they were completely different in color and size, I'm very displeased.",28690,2
28691,Too thin cheap material,28691,2
28692,Really bad quality.,28692,2
28692,"Will only use it as part of a costume, which was the intended purchase, but was hoping to wear otherwise.",28692,2
28693,not made for anyone with breasts,28693,2
28694,Hat is cute but for a toddler not an infant,28694,2
28695,"I ordered 1, got 3.",28695,2
28695,Why would I need 3?,28695,2
28695,Maybe because 1 arrived already broken?,28695,2
28695,I love the pendant though!,28695,2
28696,I expected the stones to look better than they actually do.,28696,2
28696,"I read all the reviews and thought it would be worth it; however, I am disappointed.",28696,2
28696,Not worth returning.,28696,2
28697,"I wanted to like this bra, but the sizing is way off.",28697,2
28697,It is cheaply made and wouldn't have been convenient at all postpartum.,28697,2
28697,I ended up returning it and purchasing some padded sports bras from Walmart for a much better price,28697,2
28698,"Waist too high, not much support.",28698,2
28699,"I liked how it fit around my waist, but the ""leg hugging"" parts were too tight around my inner thighs.",28699,2
28699,"It makes your butt look well lifted when you see it from the back angle, but when you look at your butt from the side angle it has this ugly droopy butt cheeck which it is caused by the way the garnish is so tight around your upper leg.",28699,2
28699,No wander any more why other ladies butt looked so weird from the side anymore!!!,28699,2
28699,No I know why!!,28699,2
28699,"I will not be wearing this item...I lost my money, but it also taught me a lesson.",28699,2
28699,I'll exercise!,28699,2
28700,I would like it if only I was able to wear it.,28700,2
28700,You need to be a Houdini to get in and out.,28700,2
28701,Not true undetectable so I just returned it.,28701,2
28701,It could be better if they try to add butt and hip pad in one piece.,28701,2
28702,Too small not American size,28702,2
28703,these had some awesome designs on them but they are short and not that comfortable.. and a really cheap plastic.,28703,2
28704,"Wanted no pockets, searched for no pockets, reviews and answered questions said no pockets.",28704,2
28704,"They have pockets, if that is what you want then great, not what I wanted.",28704,2
28705,Way too small!,28705,2
28706,I am very disappointed in this hoodie.,28706,2
28706,"It is not a vibrant green, the material is t- shirt thin, and in came smelling horrible!",28706,2
28706,"The smell was so strong that it stung my nose, I am a mother of two and have 3 cats...",28706,2
28706,I am not a stranger to strong odors.,28706,2
28707,I own a juicy one piece with ample bust room.,28707,2
28707,This looks likes it's made for two different people.,28707,2
28707,Doesn't begin to cover my bust.,28707,2
28707,Bummed.,28707,2
28708,These shoes are gorgeous!!,28708,2
28708,But so uncomfortable.,28708,2
28708,They run narrow.,28708,2
28708,It's metallic fabric that does not stretch.,28708,2
28708,I wrote them to a party  and by the end of the night my feet killing me.,28708,2
28708,It's a shame because they are beautiful.,28708,2
28709,The handbag is so cute but it fell apart only a couple days after I received it.,28709,2
28709,I had to return it.,28709,2
28710,It is a beautiful dress.,28710,2
28710,Unfortunately I do not have an Asian physique.,28710,2
28710,"This not only runs small, it runs about 5 sizes too small.",28710,2
28710,Be careful and order the largest size you can.,28710,2
28711,Low Quality,28711,2
28712,Paper thin garment.,28712,2
28713,The idea is great but the bracelets are very flimsy and cheap.,28713,2
28713,Better quality would be great even if you have to increase the price.,28713,2
28714,"I love the color and how the material feels but, its way too big!",28714,2
28714,I read the reviews many saying that the item ran small.,28714,2
28714,I usually buy a 1x so I went for the 2x and it fits like a 5x!,28714,2
28715,too bad such a pretty dress does not fit or have a good shape to it,28715,2
28716,I've had this wallet for 4 days and it's already falling apart.,28716,2
28716,"The credit card pockets are coming undone, because of the cheap glue used to assemble it.",28716,2
28716,I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone.,28716,2
28717,Completely see through,28717,2
28718,I regret getting these!,28718,2
28718,They didn't even come labeled so you can know what size they are.,28718,2
28718,And I didn't get all matching pairs.,28718,2
28718,I am missing a 2g.,28718,2
28719,Runs about 4 sizes too big....order down,28719,2
28720,unfortunately it got wet in the rain and has now stretched,28720,2
28721,The price is cheap and I didn't expect it to be of the highest quality.,28721,2
28721,All I wanted was to store my running shoes in it that I'd leave in my car for whenever I drive out for a run.,28721,2
28721,The strap on both of them came off pretty much after the first use.,28721,2
28721,"If it had only happened on one, I'd be fine, but it happened for both.",28721,2
28721,I guess I should've spend a bit more for a better quality product.,28721,2
28721,It smells weird (like chemicals) initially but that wares off after a couple of days.,28721,2
28721,"I still use it as I want to make it worth my money spent, so I am giving it 2 stars.",28721,2
28722,lThe dress was well made and beautiful beading.,28722,2
28722,"However, it was smaller than the measurements I gave them and I didn't like the ribbon tie in the back.",28722,2
28722,I returned the dress 4 weeks ago and still haven't received a refund.,28722,2
28723,There was a hole.. does not seem like a genuine puma product,28723,2
28724,Not what I expected.,28724,2
28725,Blouse appears to have good quality.,28725,2
28725,"I ordered in XL, it actually is somewhere between small and medium.",28725,2
28725,"I would equate it to a Juniors sizing, not Misses or Women.",28725,2
28725,Love the look and sorry I have to return it.,28725,2
28725,"I even double checked the tags inside hoping they had sent the wrong size in error (I would have reordered, but no luck)",28725,2
28726,Shirt fits on the small side.,28726,2
28726,No way you can wash in warm water.,28726,2
28726,Delivering was v e r y  S l o w !,28726,2
28726,!!!!,28726,2
28726,!,28726,2
28727,"This is NOT a v-neck, it's a draped u-shape.",28727,2
28727,"It's a nice shirt, but completely different than pictured",28727,2
28728,These are too short and stop above my knees which i don't like.,28728,2
28728,The waist size is true but they are too short.,28728,2
28729,"Really nice material, feels very durable and not cheap at all.",28729,2
28729,"But the logo must have been printed at low resolution because up close, it's kind of blurry and the red is multiple shades, but at a distance of about 12 feet, you can't tell.",28729,2
28729,"It also runs a little big, I ordered a medium, but it fits more like a large.",28729,2
28730,I sized up following user recommendations but they were still too small.,28730,2
28730,Consider sizing up even more.,28730,2
28730,I had to pay for the return which I understand BUT THE COMPANY SHOULD CHANGE THEIR SIZING CHART on the feedback they've received about this issue.,28730,2
28731,"I don't like that it wrinkles easily, it always looks like it needs ironed.",28731,2
28732,Tee shirt much darker than in image shown.,28732,2
28732,Very little contrast between logo and Tee shirt.,28732,2
28733,I usually wear a size small but after reading the reviews I ordered an XL and still fit snugly around my thighs.,28733,2
28733,It also came with HAIRS (quite a lot) when I took it out of the bag.,28733,2
28733,(???),28733,2
28733,so wash it before using it.,28733,2
28733,"It's also very sheer and has to be worn with a slip or something underneath, but I was expecting that.",28733,2
28734,This was tiny and not very warm.,28734,2
28734,The inside is pretty itchy and the quality is so-so.,28734,2
28734,I would order it like 3 sizes up and don't expect too much :(,28734,2
28735,Very cheap material and there were bleach spots on the shirt upon arrival.,28735,2
28736,The hair tie doesn't consistently stay in the bracelet :-(,28736,2
28737,"It's beautiful, but cut too small.",28737,2
28737,Definitely not true to the size.,28737,2
28737,Their XL is for someone who wears extra small.,28737,2
28738,I used this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.,28738,2
28738,It looks like something that would come out of a gumball machine.,28738,2
28738,The price was low though so I kind of anticipated it not being the best.,28738,2
28738,It makes for great costume jewelry.,28738,2
28738,Not all of us can afford real diamonds and gold but we still wanna wear some sparkle!!,28738,2
28738,!,28738,2
28739,I had to return this suit.,28739,2
28739,"In order for the bottoms to fit, I had to order quite a few sizes up from my usual size, according to their measurements and chart.",28739,2
28739,"Despite this, the bottom leg holes were SO small, to the point of cutting off circulation and the top was so large I could have fit in it twice with room to spare.",28739,2
28739,"Bizarre sizing and measurements for a suit, much less a two piece.",28739,2
28739,I've never had a problem with tops and bottoms of the same size not fitting me.,28739,2
28739,"It did seem like a super cute and flattering design and of great quality, especially for such a fair price, though.",28739,2
28740,my husband starting wearing them and each one he wears they BREAK,28740,2
28741,This is not something you can wear everyday.,28741,2
28741,It can break easily.,28741,2
28741,"It has a nice design, opens and closes.",28741,2
28742,Too small.,28742,2
28742,Low Quality materiap,28742,2
28743,I expected a better looking pair of pants for the price,28743,2
28744,Far too small for a theoretical plus size.,28744,2
28744,"Would have been cute, so will offer it to my friend who wears a size medium, as it might fit her.",28744,2
28745,The sizes run big and it isn't form fitting like the pic.,28745,2
28746,"Worth the price, I guess.",28746,2
28746,It broke after a couple uses.,28746,2
28746,Not worth it.,28746,2
28747,Expected it to be longer and hang like the picture,28747,2
28748,Butterfly is bigger and heavier than I thought it would be.,28748,2
28748,Beautiful.,28748,2
28748,"As soon as my daughter tried to put it on, the band's came apart.",28748,2
28748,We have to find another way for her to wear it.,28748,2
28748,"Otherwise, it's a good deal.",28748,2
28749,The color is vibrant and wallet has the amount of compartments that I need but it has a horrible fish smell that will not go away,28749,2
28750,The iron on decal came off the firt day my son wore it.,28750,2
28751,It looks pretty but it is so lightweight that it doesn't stay in place.,28751,2
28751,Shifts around too easy.,28751,2
28751,The color is more of a tarnished gold than true silver.,28751,2
28752,I've purchased these before and they lasted 3 years.,28752,2
28752,The plastic headband on these is too tight and gives me a headache.,28752,2
28753,It was not a dress.,28753,2
28753,In 5'8 and the length came right below my behind!!!!,28753,2
28753,"It's a beautiful color (blue), but certainly not a dress on me.",28753,2
28754,The dress looks much better in the picture.,28754,2
28754,The color of the actual dress is lime green not that beautiful green in the picture.,28754,2
28754,Dress fits fine.,28754,2
28754,Just doesn't look good.,28754,2
28755,"Cute concept, but poor materials.",28755,2
28755,Felt like a trash bag...returned.,28755,2
28756,It doesn't gather at the shoulders as in the picture and the material is thin and extremely wrinkled.,28756,2
28756,I would like to return it,28756,2
28757,Fit perfect according to the sizing chart but the colors are lighter than the picture shows.,28757,2
28757,The zipper is also on the left side which bothered me enough to return it.,28757,2
28758,Broke.,28758,2
28758,Right away,28758,2
28759,"Not too pleased with product I use them for work and they seem to attract dirt and anything else you make work with such as insulation dust,etc.not easily dusted off like denim they also wrinkle very easily and make them less attractive,I like the fit and comfort,if possibly made from different fabric like denim or similar would be perfect.",28759,2
28760,Not true to size and not well made,28760,2
28761,too short and the caged top does not look like the picture.,28761,2
28761,the top is messed up and not made correctly.,28761,2
28762,Smells like oil or chemicals.,28762,2
28762,Not great quality.,28762,2
28763,Cheap made,28763,2
28764,The material used in this garment is way to stretchable and sleeves and belt  become way to long and hard to tie.,28764,2
28764,"I definitely would not
buy again nor recommend to a friend .",28764,2
28765,I loved the ring & the fact that it'd adjustable but the crystal fell out after only wearing it 4 times.,28765,2
28765,I believe the one I got was green aventurine so hopefully it brings luck to the person who finds it.,28765,2
28766,I have a handful of Carhartt pants in several different styles.,28766,2
28766,I have two pairs in this style.,28766,2
28766,All of them fit consistently.,28766,2
28766,I tried to replace my worn out charcoal loose fit 5 pocket canvas carpenter jeans and received a pair that was far too small through the waist.,28766,2
28766,I returned them and ordered a replacement and got another pair that was far too small.,28766,2
28766,What do I do?,28766,2
28766,Is it just this style that has shifted sizes?,28766,2
28766,is it just this color?,28766,2
28766,This is a huge pain in the butt.,28766,2
28766,I need to replace my favorite worn out pants and this too much work.,28766,2
28767,This is not colored metal.,28767,2
28767,"It is COATED in paint that quickly chips off, which is disturbing because it's in your mouth.",28767,2
28767,They also taste like pennies are in your mouth.,28767,2
28767,"However, I don't think you can expect much better for this price.",28767,2
28768,Snags everything,28768,2
28769,Zipper broke easily on this product,28769,2
28770,It's way short and way too small.,28770,2
28771,Fit is smaller then what we expected.,28771,2
28771,She barely wears a 0 so thaought ordering a 2 would for no problem but it is a snug zip.,28771,2
28772,"To
 big and just don't like it!",28772,2
28773,this shoes its beautiful on!!,28773,2
28773,I wore it for a wedding and I got blisters on my bottom of my feet and the side of my toes!!,28773,2
28773,"you can't wear it for a long time, it start hurting after about an hour from the start of the event, I wish I had an extra shoe with me, but since I had not choice but to wore it, I end up with sore feet and blisters:(",28773,2
28774,I don't like it!!,28774,2
28774,!,28774,2
28775,Not happy with this at all.,28775,2
28775,The picture shows an open sweater.,28775,2
28775,"Upon closers reading, it's labeled as a pull over.",28775,2
28775,It's very small and like others have posted it does have a bad smell to it.,28775,2
28776,I'm a 36 D..these did nothing for me,28776,2
28777,these are a bizarre fit on me as they they also bunch in the front like they are too big then sit really low like they are too small.,28777,2
28777,If I fold the top down like in the picture stuff that should not be showing starts to.,28777,2
28778,Not clear on sizing,28778,2
28779,If you buy this coat buy 2 sizes larger than you normally wear.,28779,2
28779,The bust is very tight as are the hips.,28779,2
28779,Arms are short.,28779,2
28779,The material is nice quality and seams nicely made.,28779,2
28779,I was very disappointed with the fit of the jacket.,28779,2
28779,I purchased one size larger based on the reviewes and the size chart and it was still too tight.,28779,2
28779,.,28779,2
28779,overall I was very unsatisfied.,28779,2
28779,I don't normally write negative reviews so this is not easy for me....just buy a size or two larger than you normally would.,28779,2
28779,I wear a large...bought x lg.. Too tight....,28779,2
28780,Terrible they broke in 2 days,28780,2
28781,It's not a sweatshirt.,28781,2
28781,It's a long sleeved t-shirt.,28781,2
28781,"It's cute, but I was expecting a sweatshirt, and this was very disappointing.",28781,2
28782,The size chart provided was not accurate.,28782,2
28782,The chart recommended medium for someone at least 6'3.,28782,2
28782,The chart should have also included waist size.,28782,2
28782,The product did not fit.,28782,2
28783,The material is too thin.,28783,2
28783,Was not what I was expecting.,28783,2
28783,However the length was perfect.,28783,2
28784,"The sizing is great, and the fabric is nice and thick, but the stitching came out almost completely after the first wash.",28784,2
28784,Very disappointing.,28784,2
28785,"It looked exactly like the photo, it just runs big",28785,2
28786,This bra is horrible it runs real small it was not a 34 maybe a 32 and they even send an extender with it and even with that it was too small very uncomfortable side wire digs into Ur ribcage.,28786,2
28786,But the worst thing is it has really short shoulder straps so it looks like Ur breast is up around Ur neck.,28786,2
28786,I bought two of these and can't wear either one I am going to take them to a seamstress to see if she can lengthen the shoulder straps and remove the side wire and since I got two bras with extenders I am going to wear two extenders on one bra see if that helps they where 25 each so too much to just throw away and sending them back is not a option cause it took a month to get them I think they came from China do not buy u will be greatly disappointed,28786,2
28787,I bought this hat because it is very similar to a hat sold by Boston Proper for $99.00.,28787,2
28787,"I can only give this hat 2 stars because although it is a well made, sturdy hat, it is WAY too big.",28787,2
28787,I do not have a small head and the hat is so big on me I could never wear it.,28787,2
28787,"If I can't find a way to shrink it, I will have to return it.",28787,2
28788,Fabric is way too thick.,28788,2
28789,"I really enjoy the picture of these rings, but the actual rings looks nothing like the picture.",28789,2
28789,"For the price I cant really complain but then again
I did spend my money so I prefer my rings not to break within the hour.",28789,2
28790,The back of the shoe is very flimsy and folds inwards when putting on.,28790,2
28790,My almost 5 year old hates wearing them.,28790,2
28790,They are cute but not if you want to have to fix the back every single time you put on.,28790,2
28790,Maybe we should've gone a size bigger.,28790,2
28791,They send me the wrong size and wrong color :( very dissapointed.,28791,2
28791,It looks like decent quality fabric though which is the only plus.,28791,2
28792,Wife was thinking it was a two piece..Turned out it was jus a large scarf..,28792,2
28793,Not as expected.,28793,2
28793,Has a terrible smell.,28793,2
28793,Sleeves are not even close to being as long as the photo and are not batwing.,28793,2
28793,Neck hole is nowhere near being large enough to drape off one shoulder.,28793,2
28794,"Doesn't come with the top like photos, should mention it clearly",28794,2
28795,"comfy but huge, order a size or 2 smaller",28795,2
28796,This did not fit very well at all so I wound up returning it after trying it on.,28796,2
28797,Not at all what I expected.,28797,2
28797,Look like glass.,28797,2
28798,"It came in the mail already broken, incapable of being snapped back together.",28798,2
28798,Disappointed.,28798,2
28799,Runs small for the size,28799,2
28800,Required extra loops to fit well on the lower leg.,28800,2
28800,Does hand wash well,28800,2
28801,This product did not meet up to my expectations.,28801,2
28801,They sized wrong.,28801,2
28802,"Nice color, but...It's too small, I order twice in large and XXL and still too small.",28802,2
28802,"It's for people that doesn't have breast at all, it doesn't have any space for your breast it for skinny people with any curve.",28802,2
28802,Too bad!,28802,2
28802,!,28802,2
28803,"As beautiful as this is, it cannot be worn easily because of the smell of the fabric.",28803,2
28803,The odor is so bad that we just pitched the clothing out.,28803,2
28803,It is a very beautiful design and we regret not being able to use it.,28803,2
28804,runs way too small.,28804,2
28804,"I usually wear a size 3 in juniors and my waist is 28 inches, and I could barely squeeze into these without it bulging.",28804,2
28804,the material is also kind of stiff.,28804,2
28805,Not that great of quality and would definitely not keep you warm.,28805,2
28805,pretty disappointed,28805,2
28806,Weird straps,28806,2
28807,"Beautiful glasses, but too right behind my ears.",28807,2
28807,They gave me a headache as soon as I put them on.,28807,2
28808,it says xl looks like medium,28808,2
28809,I gave this 2 stars because the packaging was actually nice.,28809,2
28809,It comes in a zippered plastic pouch perfect for putting a wet suit in.,28809,2
28809,I ordered this thinking this is the cutest suite that hides belly fat and enhances your ladies all at the same time.,28809,2
28809,The size on the suite says 2x.,28809,2
28809,Wait... what?,28809,2
28809,"I'm a size 8, but in bathing suites I am usually a 10.",28809,2
28809,I can move past the label.,28809,2
28809,I'm a strong independent woman and don't need the validation of a manufacturers tag to make me feel sexy.,28809,2
28809,"Am I right, ladies?",28809,2
28809,"Anyway, this suite is SMALL.",28809,2
28809,If you want to give this suite a try I would order 2 sizes bigger.,28809,2
28809,"Also, there seems to be something up with the cups on this thing!",28809,2
28809,No joke!,28809,2
28809,You will instantly be propelled back to your Madonna days as this suite will give you cone boob and not in a good way,28809,2
28810,The color and shape was decent but it fit looser than I was expecting and I got the smallest size.,28810,2
28810,The threads were already coming undone after the first wash and it stretched out a lot.,28810,2
28811,I sized up like it says to do in the description TWICE and both pairs were to small.,28811,2
28811,"I usually wear a large, first pair was an XL, couldn't zipper them, second pair was an Xxl, got em zippered (barely) but there was major bunching in all the wrong places in the front (if you catch my drift.)",28811,2
28811,"Gave first pair to my gramma, they fit her perfectly, will have second pair tailored.",28811,2
28812,Would suggest to order a size up from your normal size.,28812,2
28812,Dress was supposed to be ivory but was actually a pure white.,28812,2
28812,Pretty but the quality seemed a bit different from that in the photo.,28812,2
28812,This was a prom dress for my niece....if I'd had more time I probably would have returned it and gotten something else.,28812,2
28813,Material is very thin and size is smaller than expected.,28813,2
28814,The bottoms fit very well.,28814,2
28814,"However, the top was a bit on the big side.",28814,2
28815,I got it caught on my shirt & the metal bent that the chain goes through.,28815,2
28815,That part is very light weight.,28815,2
28815,The actual cross is OK just the cheap metal the chain goes through bends easily.,28815,2
28815,I only right honest reviews.,28815,2
28816,It's pretty but seriously a small child couldn't fit in this shirt,28816,2
28817,"too flimsy, and it does not fit very good.",28817,2
28818,"It was fine for a while and I got a lot of complements at school, but when I started putting books in it, it started tearing.",28818,2
28818,Two stars for the cute design and ample amount of pockets,28818,2
28819,The material is cheap and shinny and it is some what large.,28819,2
28820,"Way way way, too big.",28820,2
28820,"I have small hands, but I also had my mom and a few friends try it on too and it was way to big for them as well, a real shame since this was for a prom look.",28820,2
28821,The top is too small.,28821,2
28821,It was padded and the cups were very hard.,28821,2
28821,The bottom is bigger than it should be and was cut lower than it shows in the picture.,28821,2
28821,"Because the bottom is larger, the criss crosses kind of bulge out.",28821,2
28821,It was odd.,28821,2
28821,I was disappointed that I had to return it because the picture looks really good and the fabric seemed to be decent material.,28821,2
28822,Only giving a 2 star rating because the fabric felt soft.,28822,2
28822,"The neck was way to wide, and it was weirdly long.",28822,2
28822,Not at all like the description.,28822,2
28822,Don't waste your money.,28822,2
28823,"bad quality, few weeks after stop working, not worth the money",28823,2
28824,This was much bigger than I expected.,28824,2
28824,When I washed it it it shrunk and wrinkled so badly that it looked like someone had wrung it out and twisted it.,28824,2
28824,"Even after ironing, it still looked awful.",28824,2
28825,"Normally a size 16, ordered an 18.",28825,2
28825,Way too small.,28825,2
28825,"The dress hugs very tightly to your body, I would recommend sizing up at least 2 dress sizes.",28825,2
28825,I returned it.,28825,2
28826,"It barley fir my youngest daughter that is 115 lb ad 5'5""",28826,2
28827,I was expecting it to be cotton.,28827,2
28827,It's like a bathing suit material.,28827,2
28827,Kinda disappointed.,28827,2
28827,It'll be a house cleaning top.,28827,2
28828,"Didn't fit,and was so uncomfortable",28828,2
28829,Is not what I was expected,28829,2
28830,I am returning these as they arrived and are way too small.,28830,2
28831,"Well, since reviews said it was smaller than expected, I actually ordered a 2XL, when I am normally a medium or large in tops.",28831,2
28831,"The body fit okay, but sleeves were quite long.",28831,2
28831,Pretty flimsy material with black ink writing.,28831,2
28831,Not great quality and not worth the price.,28831,2
28831,I would have been better off trying to find a Grease type knock off jacket at Goodwill.,28831,2
28832,One pair was fine.,28832,2
28832,I ordered two more and they were too small.,28832,2
28833,Very small almost like kids size.,28833,2
28833,Don't buy if you are an adult or junior size.,28833,2
28833,Fits like a kids 14/16.,28833,2
28834,"I purchased a 3x,fits like a 1x",28834,2
28835,I bought a two pkg was nicely folded and then I bought a four pack it was shoved in the pkg like they been used... And one was med.. And the other three was large:(,28835,2
28836,Definitely Asian sizing.,28836,2
28836,I ordered an XL and it was still pretty tiny,28836,2
28837,It was really pretty but pieces came falling out of it immediately... very disappointing.,28837,2
28837,:o(,28837,2
28838,Ripped first week we had it,28838,2
28839,I ordered two of these.,28839,2
28839,One of them arrived with the elastic already coming off one end.,28839,2
28839,The other arrived fine but the seam came out after about a month.,28839,2
28839,Disappointed with the quality.,28839,2
28840,the pearls are over dramatic and look gaudy.,28840,2
28841,"Cute dress, but it was way too small even though I ordered a size up.",28841,2
28841,Its a weird fabric that has absolutely zero stretch to it and no zipper or anything so it took me like 10 minutes to get it off.,28841,2
28842,Shorter than I would like,28842,2
28843,doesn't glow.,28843,2
28843,left in light for hours.,28843,2

28843,Its just ok. wish it glowed as advertised.,28843,2
28844,repair doesn't last very long.,28844,2
28844,pretty flimsy.,28844,2
28844,Just get it sown back on.,28844,2
28845,Very disappointed.,28845,2
28845,It doesn't play the song.,28845,2
28845,It plays such a small segment of the song that it's hardly recognizable.,28845,2
28845,"It looks nice, but the reason I bought this instead of another music box was for the song, which has special meaning for my wife.",28845,2
28846,My wife loved this shirt  - the sizing was a little snug - BUT she was extremely disappointed when she washed it and the seams tore so now there is a big hole in the back of the shirt...,28846,2
28847,poor quality...seems to be falling apart without abuse.,28847,2
28848,Very thin not a nice feeling material scratchy see through also came in a bag all wrinkled.,28848,2
28848,Looks cheap feels cheap not something I would buy again.,28848,2
28849,Material is ok. Stitching is not of the greatest quality though.,28849,2
28849,The black neck is sewn on vey cheaply and uneven.,28849,2
28849,The collar looks awkward.,28849,2
28849,Had to cut the seams to take the collar off and just wore a black shirt underneath.,28849,2
28849,Looks better in my opinion.,28849,2
28849,Bought this and the Captain Kirk uniform for my husband.,28849,2
28849,Same issues with the collar.,28849,2
28849,The metal insignia is a nice addition at least,28849,2
28850,Very thin!!,28850,2
28850,Hope whomever buys this doesn't have nipples.,28850,2
28851,"Material is very stretchy so make sure you get a good size, shows everything back rolls, stomach pooch, bra strap marks.",28851,2
28852,Sunglasses are stylish and well constructed but the lenses are very dark.,28852,2
28852,For that reason I can't wear them very often.,28852,2
28852,I constantly taking them on and off when it's overcast.,28852,2
28853,The pants to small to tight the top too big but I can adjusted ...,28853,2
28853,So now I have to get some water pants for the top Ugh!,28853,2
28854,"The dress fits really small, around the waist.",28854,2
28854,"I had bought it for my daughter for her senior pictures, and it doesn't have the train on the back of the dress like the picture of the dress showed when I ordered it.",28854,2
28854,"It is a pretty dress, but something about the waist line makes the dress look cheap.",28854,2
28854,"My daughter said she liked the dress, she wasn't that excited about it when we received it as she was when we ordered it, but I guess if she liked it, guess it will be o.k.",28854,2
28855,Its does not have any support.,28855,2
28856,I bought these just to try.,28856,2
28856,Saw that I should buy twice my size and did.,28856,2
28856,The colors are nice.,28856,2
28856,The material is stretchy and looks to be about the quality of my Bali's.,28856,2
28856,But the smell of the dye is beyond horrible.,28856,2
28856,"I've washed them 4 times...alone in hot water...and upon opening the door of my washer, I still smelled the dye!",28856,2
28856,They were a cheap price and I thought they would be worth the effort when I saw reviewers comment about the dye smell.,28856,2
28856,I've purchsed China-made clothes before and washed them before wearing to remove dye odor.,28856,2
28856,I figured....thin material on undies....how many washings would it take to get the odor out....maybe one?,28856,2
28856,Nope!,28856,2
28856,"IF you're ""not"" worried about what this kind of dye might do to your body....I gave 2 stars.",28856,2
28856,"For me, I feel these panties deserve half a star for effort by the company only.",28856,2
28856,Too bad because the material and sewing quality was good.,28856,2
28857,This card protector will pop open on its own in my pocket.,28857,2
28857,The protector is only a couple weeks old and it has scratches on the the case .,28857,2
28857,Looks like I have had it a year.,28857,2
28857,I would not recommend this product.,28857,2
28858,Made out of a very nasty almost pasticy fake feeling material.,28858,2
28858,Zipper doesnt zip all the way.,28858,2
28858,Barely fit around my waist and I have a very small waist.,28858,2
28858,"I am 5'4"" and weigh 150",28858,2
28859,I am five three and ordered a large.,28859,2
28859,Doesn't even cover my panties in the front!,28859,2
28859,Not a dress for sure!,28859,2
28860,"Pretty color,  Size runs smaller then expected",28860,2
28861,Bracelet broke first time worn,28861,2
28862,Cute but cheap fabric and didn't fit properly.,28862,2
28863,"The cap looks as expected, but the dome of it is oddly shaped.",28863,2
28863,Makes it feel awkward when worn.,28863,2
28864,"I have worn the sandals for the fourth time today and they broke, the left one at the front.",28864,2
28864,I did not check previously but it looks like it had too little rim left while sewn into the sole.,28864,2
28864,Unfortunately I got them about a month ago and they are not eligible for return.,28864,2
28865,Way larger than anticipated.,28865,2
28865,Cheap material and the collar sits weird.,28865,2
28865,"If you just need a tacky hawaiian shirt, however, this is a good buy.",28865,2
28866,Not warm enough for a cold Montana day.,28866,2
28866,My husband has to wear an extra pair of gloves with them.,28866,2
28867,"Material is cheap, you can see through it and the chevrons are not lined up properly so the pattern looks off.",28867,2
28867,Get two sizes larger then what you would normally because it runs rather small and shorter in length then expected.,28867,2
28867,"I am normally a size XL, 185 lbs and 6 feet.",28867,2
28867,The dress did not fit my bust 36 D and would not touch my shoes.,28867,2
28868,The cut off this dress is weird and the fabric feels very cheap.,28868,2
28868,Tight around the chest and I don't have a large chest (38c ordered xl).,28868,2
28868,I wouldn't buy again.,28868,2
28869,"The color definitely does not match the one in the photo, it is more of a ruby red.",28869,2
28869,The fabric is also very silky which I am not a fan of.,28869,2
28869,"My chest is definitely proportionate with my body, yet the hoodie hugged my breasts and was huge everywhere else.",28869,2
28869,"Although it is a good price, I would not recommend buying it.",28869,2
28870,"Very cheap ""fur"" on the inside.",28870,2
28870,"It's not even fully ""furred"" inside.",28870,2
28871,Ordered a size up and still way to small.,28871,2
28871,Disappointed.,28871,2
28872,"There was a itty bitty hole on it, eh.",28872,2
28873,Super cute!,28873,2
28873,I can only hope that one day I will shrink down enough to fit into something a five year old could wear.,28873,2
28873,Order about four sizes up.,28873,2
28874,I returned these.,28874,2
28874,I thought I was buying an ankle version of the same capris I already have by this brand but they did not feel the same at all.,28874,2
28874,These were not nearly as stretchy and comfortable as the capri pair I have.,28874,2
28874,Not sure why they are so different?,28874,2
28875,way too small ...and it's an XL...what's up with that????,28875,2
28875,it's so cute!!,28875,2
28875,!,28875,2
28876,Not happy with the top as it was VERY see-through.,28876,2
28876,But I love the skirt.,28876,2
28877,Returned it!,28877,2
28877,Cheaply made!,28877,2
28878,Had to send it back.,28878,2
28878,"Way too small on top for my wife, and the bottom was too big.",28878,2
28879,This one came with the chain that was put together with another chain link - looked like it has been repaired and the clasp does not open to fasten it.,28879,2
28879,-  Joan K,28879,2
28880,One pair arrived with a hole in it but I had washed some of the others so I couldn't return them.,28880,2
28880,Another two pair had the color printed on the very thin material so thin once I put them on you could see through them.,28880,2
28880,I trashed them and chalked it up to a reminder that you often get what you pay for in this world.,28880,2
28881,We had the Hilos in navy/green lining and my son wore them for over s year and they were his favorite.,28881,2
28881,Bought the black and the lining is different.,28881,2
28881,It's very thin and doesn't wrap around like the navy's did.,28881,2
28881,After one wear he had major blisters on the inside of both ankles!,28881,2
28881,What?!,28881,2
28881,The lining was already wearing away to the seems and cutting into his foot!,28881,2
28881,I returned.,28881,2
28881,Maybe should have stuck with the navy ones.,28881,2
28882,"They fit great, which was a surprise.",28882,2
28882,"After I ordered them, I realized they were supposed to be for a man.",28882,2
28882,But they fit me just fine and I normally wear a small woman's glove.,28882,2
28882,The problem is that they stink.,28882,2
28882,They smell like they were soaked in gasoline.,28882,2
28882,I have washed and washed them.,28882,2
28882,I have soaked them in soapy water.,28882,2
28882,They still stink.,28882,2
28882,"If I can't find a way to get rid of the smell, I can't wear them, which is a shame since they fit well and washed well.",28882,2
28882,They just smell really bad.,28882,2
28883,Aaaagh..looks very inexpensive  :(,28883,2
28884,"It may be a ""blue zircon"" but the stone in the ring I received is GREEN!",28884,2
28884,I mean Irish Green.,28884,2
28884,I can use it so I'll keep it.,28884,2
28884,But I can't use for the reason I bought it.,28884,2
28884,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,28884,2
28884,I DO NOT RECCOMMEND ONLY IF YOU WANT A GREEN STONE!,28884,2
28885,"These have a VERY STRONG odor - like kerosene fumes, or a strong chemical smell.",28885,2
28885,"I've been trying to air them out, but so far, no success.",28885,2
28885,"From what I can tell, they may fit okay.",28885,2
28885,"The colors are nice, but because of the odor, I haven't worn them yet - so I cannot review the size - however, the review template required that I rate the fit (hard to do if you can barely stand to be in the same room with them).",28885,2
28885,"I am not able to review whether they hold up and don't run - several people have complained about snags, runs and that you can see through the fabric.",28885,2
28885,I ordered the six-pack of dark colors & some of the colors aren't very distinguishable between others.,28885,2
28885,Some are clearly the color stated.,28885,2
28885,"I am not sure I would buy these again, and I may send them back if those fumes don't go away.",28885,2
28885,"I did NOT get paid for a review or get any sort of discount - I paid full price (which is not a bad price, but still...).",28885,2
28885,I'm just not happy with the fumes from them.,28885,2
28885,I agree with others who say they're a bit more like tights than leggings.,28885,2
28886,Poor material,28886,2
28887,Odd shape..,28887,2
28887,Smaller around the armpits area,28887,2
28888,My granddaughter picked the Pink boots - they are adorable.,28888,2
28888,"They look good with jeans, sweats and snow suits.",28888,2
28888,"BUT, they hurt my granddaughter's feet.",28888,2
28888,"And comfort is the number one, most important thing when it comes to shoes.",28888,2
28888,Even though we bought a 1/2 size larger something about the inside of the boots is very uncomfortable to her.,28888,2
28888,We tried different sock thicknesses in an attempt to salvage the boots.,28888,2
28888,But after an hour or so she was pulling them off.,28888,2
28888,"Even though she didn't wear them often, the boot is coming unglued from the sole on the left boot.",28888,2
28888,I would not repurchase these boots.,28888,2
28888,"Therefore I
can Not in good conscience recommend them to others.",28888,2
28889,"Not really a practical ring at all, and fits much larger then expected.",28889,2
28889,Maybe it's my fault for not reading the specs.,28889,2
28889,"But this is not a daily ring, this is a prop or a piece for a costume.",28889,2
28889,Completely unusable everyday.,28889,2
28889,It nearly covers both my fingers on each side.,28889,2
28889,It is massive.,28889,2
28889,And the detail isn't very neat.,28889,2
28889,I would not recommend buying this unless your trying to be a Templar in a play or movie costume.,28889,2
28890,Very thin and much too big..,28890,2
28890,I was hoping for something warmer..,28890,2
28891,buy cheap get cheap!!!,28891,2
28891,the sponges for the breast move a lot.,28891,2
28891,i do not recommend this!!,28891,2
28891,!,28891,2
28892,I ordered a 3X so it would be roomy.. these shirts fit more like a plain large.,28892,2
28892,"I do love the fabric though, it is very soft and silky.. just not sized appropriately.",28892,2
28892,These Chinese companies that manufacture clothing for the US need to understand what our size markings mean.,28892,2
28893,horrible material,28893,2
28894,"I purposely bought the largest size, and it didn't fit.",28894,2
28894,My best friend who weighs 100lbs couldn't fit into it.,28894,2
28894,Waste of money.,28894,2
28895,"I like the quality of these beanies,  but the picture and description is very misleading.",28895,2
28895,"The beanies aren't slouchy, but rather they fit like a normal beanie.",28895,2
28895,Not what I was wanting.,28895,2
28896,"Physical shirt is great, but the screen-print itself is extremely off-center and not even parallel to the hem line.",28896,2
28897,Im normally a Medium but ordered an XL and even that was wayyy too small for my bust size.,28897,2
28897,These bras are convenient with the front zipper but definitely made for women with no chest.,28897,2
28897,Order 2-3 sizes larger if you have a decent bust.,28897,2
28898,It change color immediatelly.,28898,2
28899,Turned out small so it was tight.,28899,2
28899,Bought large but guess XL would have been my best pick even though I usually do large.,28899,2
28899,Sewing was poor with threads sticking out and quality certainly not like I expected.,28899,2
28899,Would not purchase again.,28899,2
28900,"There is NO padding in the swimsuit, although it states there is, and the fabric is also super thin and see through.",28900,2
28900,"I think that if there were some thin padding, then it would make up for the fact that it is so thin, but you can pretty much see everything.",28900,2
28900,"If you can somehow wear sticky boobs or covers to make it not see through, I would say it is worth the $4 and what should be expected from at $4 suit.",28900,2
28900,Idk if I will ever wear it...,28900,2
28900,If you're looking for a durable suit this isn't the one for you.,28900,2
28901,Pants much smaller than normal XXL,28901,2
28902,Son loves the shirt.....but it fits very small!!!,28902,2
28902,He wears 18 months...bought 2T...and break fits!,28902,2
28903,Sad.,28903,2
28903,Wish this wasn't one size.,28903,2
28903,I'm not the skinniest girl and I don't have a small chest yet this wasn't snug enough for me.,28903,2
28903,And it also doesn't look like the pic.,28903,2
28903,The pic shows 2 seams in front going from the bottom to top over where your nips would be.,28903,2
28903,That would've given more support.,28903,2
28904,Small,28904,2
28905,"Fit as expected, comfortable to wear even at night time.",28905,2
28905,Only 2 stars because i have to fix and adjust the foam caps most of the time.,28905,2
28905,After every laundry the foam caps are out of place.,28905,2
28905,"Also, the foam caps are very noticeable when i wear light clothes so i only use this when i wear dark clothes.",28905,2
28905,I should have ordered the bra with the foam attached or non removable.,28905,2
28906,"I am 5'2"" and weigh about 116.",28906,2
28906,They call me petite.,28906,2
28906,The sweaters arms were 3/4 on me and the bottom of the sweater was only about jacket length.,28906,2
28906,It runs extremely small.,28906,2
28906,It might work better on my niece.,28906,2
28907,The zippers are terrible...and there is only two compartments...one small one in the front and the rest of the body is one,28907,2
28908,"totally diappointed, never able to perform as stated",28908,2
28909,These are made of very cheap material and completely stretch out after wearing them for just a few hours.,28909,2
28909,By the end of the day they are slouching all the way down my ankles and will even bunch at the toes!,28909,2
28910,Where you put it on it broke instantly,28910,2
28911,"Will I ever find a swimsuit that covers, supports, is comfortable, economical & pretty?",28911,2
28911,This one wasn't it either.,28911,2
28911,Return.,28911,2
28911,I am 5'3 and 103 lbs; small frame.,28911,2
28911,I wear a 34B underwire bra.,28911,2
28911,I like support!,28911,2
28911,I ordered this swimsuit in a 0-2.,28911,2
28911,It is an adorable swimsuit although I didn't like the color.,28911,2
28911,It was darker than I expected.,28911,2
28911,"Fit: Too short in Torso
  Too small in bust yet didn't hold me up or support bust
  Too small in shorts
I thought ""maybe the next size"" but I think it will still be too short in torso.",28911,2
28911,This swimsuit is well made; very nice material.,28911,2
28911,The skirt covers very nicely.,28911,2
28912,Runs small so order a size bigger!,28912,2
28912,"My daughter's feet were hurting here for the wedding, getting blisters.",28912,2
28912,Very disappointed that she won't be wearing these again.,28912,2
28913,It is not a bright yellow like the picture shows.,28913,2
28913,It is more of a pale yellow.,28913,2
28913,I wear a large and ordered 2 sizes up.,28913,2
28913,It fits fine.,28913,2
28913,The material is really thin and the sleeves are itchy,28913,2
28914,"The ear-lobe expert did not work well for my ears, they did not attach well and the hanging earring did not hang well.",28914,2
28914,Very difficult to apply and the adhesive did not attach well behind ear.,28914,2
28914,I will not purchase again.,28914,2
28915,The product is fine.,28915,2
28916,It gave me a blister the first time I wore them because of how steep they are.,28916,2
28916,My foot just kept sliding to the front do that I was just walking in my toes.,28916,2
28917,This is a nice necklace however I expected better quality.,28917,2
28917,Looks cheap.,28917,2
28918,"It won't stay on my shoulders, and is wide through the waist, with arms that are just slightly too short.",28918,2
28919,Had a funky smell.,28919,2
28919,Runs extremely large.,28919,2
28919,Ended up returning.,28919,2
28920,Sweatshirt my @#$.,28920,2
28920,It's a long sleeve tee with a hood.,28920,2
28920,Iron on looking picture.,28920,2
28920,A bit tight for an XL.,28920,2
28920,Disappointed,28920,2
28921,Elastic snapped off as soon as I tried to tighten the hood.,28921,2
28922,"This is a pretty little anklet, but it caught and broke within a few times of wearing it.",28922,2
28922,"It would be easy enough to fix with some little pliers, but I haven't taken the time to do so.",28922,2
28922,"It looks like nice metal, and the little turquoise piece is pretty.",28922,2
28923,"While these are very soft, the size is either wrong, or they sent the wrong size.",28923,2
28923,"I am a size 16/18, and these just fit...strangely.",28923,2
28923,"The crotch is too short, and the butt is too low or short.",28923,2
28923,The fabric is also much thinner than it feels - they're more like heavy tights than something a grown woman should wear as pants in public.,28923,2
28923,I almost put my finger right through it trying to tug the short waisted leggings a bit higher so I wouldn't have plumber's crack.,28923,2
28923,Very disappointing.,28923,2
28924,Not very supportive and the opening is not too comfortable for nursing.,28924,2
28924,Not very happy with it.,28924,2
28925,"I wasn't expecting much from an eight dollar sweater, but this still managed to dissapoint me.",28925,2
28925,"From the scratchy material to the sleeves landing 3 inches above my wrist in an extra large (mind you I am not that tall being about 5' 6"").",28925,2
28925,This was a disappointment all around.,28925,2
28926,Needs way way more stretch.,28926,2
28927,Too small does not fit as expected as far as length otherwise super cute,28927,2
28928,Only for super skinny girls,28928,2
28929,I had the same problem another customer had - one of the ties was sewn on the inside of the suit with no way to get it out (short of taking the suit apart and re-sewing it).,28929,2
28930,Cheap looking,28930,2
28931,I wear a medium and that is the size that I got.,28931,2
28931,It's a bit tight.,28931,2
28931,I love the colors tho.,28931,2
28932,"I was looking forward to wearing this to help keep my jeans up, however I am constantly having to pull my jeans up and pull this down.",28932,2
28932,It is a headache.,28932,2
28932,I guess I will try to get a size down and hope it works.,28932,2
28932,I ordered the size I needed based off of the sizing chart.,28932,2
28932,I am early in my pregnancy so maybe it will fit better towards the end of it.,28932,2
28933,Wrong size,28933,2
28934,Very cheaply made.,28934,2
28934,Donated to Goodwill after 1 wearing.,28934,2
28935,Earrings arrived with no back and one was bent.,28935,2
28936,I really liked the looks of this hat with the U.S Army embroidered and the Army Seal.,28936,2
28936,Two problems I have with this hat.,28936,2
28936,1. the Army seal is not straight on the front.,28936,2
28936,Its kind of off to one side.,28936,2
28936,It almost looks like the brim was not sewed on the hat straight??,28936,2
28936,2.,28936,2
28936,The clasp in the back of the hat does not hold the hat adjustment at all.,28936,2
28936,I had to sew it together the keep in the spot that fits me.,28936,2
28936,Me as an Army Vet I'm very particular to detail and the detail of this hat is way off in my opinion.,28936,2
28936,I'm not very happy with this hat because of these defects.,28936,2
28936,I would like to have another one but I'm afraid to pay another 30.00 and get the same issue.,28936,2
28936,I will likely find me a different one.,28936,2
28937,Looks very nice.,28937,2
28937,Within two weeks the inside surfaces are pealing off.,28937,2
28938,The hoodie was too small.,28938,2
28938,"So, I gave it to my cousin and bought myself a bigger size.",28938,2
28938,But I want you to know the little mermaid is my favorite character.,28938,2
28939,Missing a white stone upon arrival.,28939,2
28940,"Sleeves are too tight, the patches on the elbows are not placed correctly and the material is not great quality.",28940,2
28941,:(,28941,2
28942,It was too small,28942,2
28943,Very thin and runs small,28943,2
28944,Doesn't look like the picture only thing  that is true about the dress is its suede material .,28944,2
28945,I wasn't a fan of this kimono.,28945,2
28945,"The color of the flowers was very red, although it appeared rather pink in the picture.",28945,2
28945,I ordered a size XL though I usually wear a L and it wouldn't stretch to cover me in the front.,28945,2
28945,I ended up returning it.,28945,2
28946,Not the vibrant blue as pictured...,28946,2
28946,But overall good fit.,28946,2
28947,"It does not look right on me, it may look ok on someone else.",28947,2
28947,I just don't like it,28947,2
28948,This hat was too small and thin i did not like,28948,2
28949,Very weird fit.,28949,2
28949,Thin.,28949,2
28949,Small around arms and chest,28949,2
28950,They look nice but are to short and irritated my skin,28950,2
28951,I purchased a 2 which is the size my daughter wears  but it was to small.,28951,2
28951,I would recommend going up a size,28951,2
28952,was okay,28952,2
28953,this bathing suit is basically some cloth; not what i expected and definitely does not provide enough support for a big chested lady (36ddd),28953,2
28954,it didn't fit my wife the sizes don't come as suggested on the chart,28954,2
28955,cheap,28955,2
28956,"I love the style and fit of the bracelet, but it came apart after three days.",28956,2
28956,Now I'm trying to figure out how to fix it.,28956,2
28957,They cave in the middle so they look weird on.,28957,2
28958,cheap reproduction of the pic.,28958,2
28958,the lace collar was beautiful but the dress part looked more like a slip  and had a seem straight down front of dress.,28958,2
28958,does not  ruffle like picture its just straight up and down no movement.,28958,2
28959,Cute but seizing is way off!,28959,2
28960,Pretty shirt.,28960,2
28960,XL was more like a XS!!!,28960,2
28960,!,28960,2
28961,"Just like the other review, the shirt I purchased had white lettering.",28961,2
28961,"The seller never answered my query as to the coloring, so I'd say that they would be difficult to contact about real issues.",28961,2
28961,"The shirt is on the small side and as it's 100% cotton, I should've ordered a size larger.",28961,2
28961,Thin material that you can see through if you hold it up to a light.,28961,2
28961,I'm going to by a similar saying from another company.,28961,2
28962,Going by the measurement chart provided the dress did not fit / the lower half was too big and waaaay too long no matter how high the heel and the top half was too small even with the top bring corset.,28962,2
28962,It would not fit my friend who is a size 6 and I ordered a 16 to be safe thinking since it is a corset top I can work with it - not enough fabric or cup room,28962,2
28963,The material is very thin and feels cheaply made.,28963,2
28963,Sorry...but I'm not really impressed by this product.,28963,2
28964,I returned these as they were not true to size.,28964,2
28964,They ran large.,28964,2
28965,Good concept.,28965,2
28965,However I am returning the set I purchased for my 4 year old.,28965,2
28965,The plastic pieces poke the top of my son's foot so they are too uncomfortable to use.,28965,2
28966,Lovely product but sizing was confusing.,28966,2
28966,It would fit a child just fine.,28966,2
28966,Funny thing though people usually comment about how small my hands and wrist are and I can't get my hand in these at all.,28966,2
28967,Will not wear.it constantly tangled.,28967,2
28967,Cannot keep straight.,28967,2
28967,Threw it away.,28967,2
28968,"Doesn't even come close to the size,  even after following the attached size chart.",28968,2
28969,Too large.,28969,2
28969,Im 5'3 fit and 110lbs.,28969,2
28969,too large on my back of the knees and inner thighs.,28969,2
28969,"I had to return it because i feel that after some use, it will be stretched out.",28969,2
28969,Otherwise GREAT material for its price!,28969,2
28969,Material is a little shiny.,28969,2
28969,not sheer.,28969,2
28969,"Too bad it didn't fit me, wish they had an XS.",28969,2
28969,But otherwise GREAT PRODUCT!,28969,2
28970,"Been told that it came small size and is not decent quality, wouldn't purchase again.",28970,2
28971,Too small and tight not good for a plus size.,28971,2
28971,I sent this back and had to pay postage.,28971,2
28972,it's super cute shirt.,28972,2
28972,but tried to return it due to complications.,28972,2
28972,They never responded to my email.,28972,2
28972,had to file a claim.,28972,2
28972,still in process.,28972,2
28972,NOT HAPPY AT ALL,28972,2
28973,"The pockets are oddly placed, color was brighter than anticipated.",28973,2
28973,I really wanted this dress to work.,28973,2
28973,It was soft and comfortable but didn't look so great.,28973,2
28974,I bought it THREE sizes larger and did not fit!....another present for my daughter!...unless you are thin....DO NOT BUT!,28974,2
28975,Runs much smaller than expected.,28975,2
28975,"I'm normally a small, ordered a small and can't breathe in this too.",28975,2
28976,2 of them broke immediately!,28976,2
28976,Would never by again.,28976,2
28977,I thought it would be a better quality.,28977,2
28977,But like the other comments you do get what you paid for.,28977,2
28977,One of the strands is looser than the other one.,28977,2
28978,Bottom is small and top is large but the company agreed to send me a new one which was nice but then accidentally sent me the same size.,28978,2
28978,Didn't bother trying to get another.,28978,2
28979,Product came bunched together.,28979,2
28979,No sizing or organization at all.,28979,2
28979,One of the plugs has a sharp spiral cut on the peg and is unusable.,28979,2
28979,I love the color but over all very disappointed with the product and packaging!,28979,2
28979,Would not buy it again,28979,2
28980,"I usually wear post earrings like this non-stop, unless I switch them out for something fancy.",28980,2
28980,"I would have preferred a screw back to these, because the post was bit short, didn't have a notch at the end to hold the fastener more securely, and after a week I have already lost one.",28980,2
28980,"I have small earlobes, so that's not the problem.",28980,2
28980,They just are cheaply made.,28980,2
28980,I guess you get what you pay for.,28980,2
28980,They looked nice for the six days they stayed in.,28980,2
28981,The difference in quality and fit between these and the identical product I ordered 6 months ago is remarkable.,28981,2
28981,"Poorer fabric, poorer fit, poorer dyes used.",28981,2
28981,VERY disappointed.,28981,2
28982,I was disappointed in the nylon polyester material.,28982,2
28982,Looks cheap.,28982,2
28983,Very pretty but meant for young toddler perhaps,28983,2
28984,Can't even wear it.,28984,2
28984,The zipper is cheap.,28984,2
28984,The material feels and looks cheap.,28984,2
28985,Main button doesn't close easily,28985,2
28986,Cute but way too small - by about 3 sizes.,28986,2
28986,Refund/return process was a bit of a challenge because it is not a US company.,28986,2
28987,I have a 44 chest and wear a 33/34 shirt.,28987,2
28987,The sleeves on this large came about half way down my forearms.,28987,2
28988,I'm so disappointed with this.,28988,2
28988,"I used it twice and on the second use, I had trouble getting it to close back down.",28988,2
28988,"I pressed the button and it collapsed, but would only go part way.",28988,2
28988,I was eventually able to force it back down and then had to turn it to get it to line up to latch again.,28988,2
28988,"The problem is that when it won't fold down, it also would fold out.",28988,2
28988,"It's as if it has to latch again before you can ""trigger"" the button again.",28988,2
28988,I had hoped for the price that I found something perfect for getting into the office on rainy days.,28988,2
28988,But I am very disappointed.,28988,2
28988,"For now it is working, but I'm very skeptical, if I had a problem after only two uses.",28988,2
28989,"Maybe these will work for your babe, but they didn't for mine.",28989,2
28989,"I ordered them because I love the Magnificent Baby hats, and hoped the gloves would be as wonderful.",28989,2
28989,My guy is super busy and into everything.,28989,2
28989,"He would've been very frustrated with the fact he couldn't grab anything with these on, as these aren't mittens.",28989,2
28989,I would guess they are great for newborns who are less mobile.,28989,2
28989,"To be fair, I returned them before trying them because I knew they wouldn't work for my guy.",28989,2
28990,WAY too small,28990,2
28991,"These are pretty toe rings, and you get a few for the price which is nice.",28991,2
28991,What I didn't like is that they turn my toe green if I wear it for more than one day.,28991,2
28991,I am going to try putting clear nail polish on the part that touches my toe and see if that helps them not to turn my toe green.,28991,2
28991,"The design is pretty, so I am bummed that they turn my toe green.",28991,2
28991,They are also a little wide and do not fit as comfortably as my other toe ring.,28991,2
28991,I have a slim toe ring that I have had on my toe for probably 20 years.,28991,2
28991,I take to clean it but that is it.,28991,2
28991,I am hoping to find another one for my other foot that fits that well and wears that well.,28991,2
28991,I can even exercise in it and it doesn't slip or bother me.,28991,2
28991,This toe ring is not that ring.,28991,2
28991,It claims to be 925 but with my toe turning green I am dubious.,28991,2
28992,The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames.,28992,2
28992,"Several years ago, I ordered a 6 pack from the same seller.",28992,2
28992,The vertical measurement of those lenses was much narrower.,28992,2
28992,"A true reading glasses size so one is able to keep them on but still be able look over or under the lense enable to use your ""normal"" eye sight again.",28992,2
28992,The 6 pack I recieved this week are being returned.,28992,2
28992,The lenses are way to big for reading glasses.,28992,2
28993,"Sorry had to send them back too small , I did like the stlye but I'm a 42 in the waist",28993,2
28994,A little snug and does not hang off shoulders very well...Cheap material also,28994,2
28995,"pants fit perfect, top way too small - great fabric but going back",28995,2
28996,The cuff on the sleeves are too tight and the body of this top is huge.,28996,2
28996,It's very strange fitting.,28996,2
28996,I will probably cut the cuffs off and see it it is more comfortable.,28996,2
28997,It tapers in the mid section,28997,2
28998,I took it out of the package and didn't even bother to TRY to put this on.,28998,2
28998,Gave to my granddaughter.,28998,2
28998,Color was nice.,28998,2
28999,Fit as expected but horrible quality.,28999,2
28999,I originally ordered a large which fit waist size well but feel weird so I thought that if I ordered a bigger size the fall would be better but it was just as bad.,28999,2
28999,Not very good seem work and poor quality material.,28999,2
28999,"If you only plan on wearing it once and for a short time, then you may be in luck... other than that you get what you pay for.",28999,2
29000,"Though these capris fit, they were longer on me than the llustrations suggested.",29000,2
29000,"I'm a short gal, and the two pairs of the same brand I bought in the past were just right.",29000,2
29000,I'm either going to have to return these or pay for alteration.,29000,2
29001,Have it too my daughter too small waist.,29001,2
29001,Cute though .,29001,2
29002,I don't understand how the medium fits on top but has small leg holes..bt a large fits the leg holes nd is too small at the top..??,29002,2
29002,?,29002,2
29003,I am a size 10 or 12 and this advertises that it goes up to size 12.,29003,2
29003,"It was very snug, which I wouldn't mind too much, since compression is good while on an airplane, but the downside is after wearing it for 9 hours on a plan, the crotch area separated in several places causing multiple holes where the stitching is.",29003,2
29003,I would not recommend purchasing if you are a 10/12.,29003,2
29003,Perhaps smaller women wouldn't cause holes.,29003,2
29004,The straps are not long enough.,29004,2
29005,This is made of a really strange fabric and doesn't hang in a flattering way.,29005,2
29006,"blue ""gem"" fell off just hanging on my earring keeper.",29006,2
29007,I would have given 5 stars if they weren't 2 sizes too small.,29007,2
29007,I really like the high waist but they are almost impossible to squeeze into.,29007,2
29007,I don't know if they are suppose to be one size fits all and are just labeled as different sizes but these definitely aren't an xl.,29007,2
29007,"I do love the material, they aren't see through, and are nice and stretchy.",29007,2
29008,great belt.,29008,2
29008,sturdy but money I had hidden in there got enough glue on it from the lining that the Forex wouldn't take the money.,29008,2
29008,I would NOT buy it again.,29008,2
29008,They must get glue that doesn't run,29008,2
29009,"Would be cute, but WAY to small.",29009,2
29009,Ordered a size or two larger than normal.,29009,2
29010,"Will work with alot of styling and will be ok for the cosplay I am doing, but it's very poorly made and obviously a cheap wig.",29010,2
29010,"Ok in a pinch, but if you have time to look for a decent one don't waste your money.",29010,2
29011,"cute idea, but bad cut, the fabric was too stretchy, too thin.",29011,2
29011,This style needs more body in the fabric to look good.,29011,2
29011,"Looks great on the model, but don't expect quality.",29011,2
29012,I returned these as they were not true to size.,29012,2
29012,They ran large.,29012,2
29013,get 3x higher in size,29013,2
29014,"It runs extremely larger then you would  imagine, like by 2 sizes at least.",29014,2
29015,I received this dress but it is very long and not flattering.,29015,2
29015,You get what you pay for.,29015,2
29015,Do not recommend.,29015,2
29016,"Waaaaaay too small, I ordered the xxxl and it's tiny.",29016,2
29016,I'll be giving it to a much smaller friend as a lingerie gift.,29016,2
29017,Not great quality.,29017,2
29017,"If it were so much trouble, I'd sent it back",29017,2
29018,Too short,29018,2
29019,I loved this piercing - the rose gold is great and didn't rub off immediately.,29019,2
29019,"However, the top of the piercing, was as secure and tight as I could get the ball.",29019,2
29019,It fell off anyway.,29019,2
29019,"I reordered another one because I like it so much and...the ball fell off again, almost immediately this time.",29019,2
29019,I had one that I wore for 5 years and never had an issue like this.,29019,2
29019,"However, the price is really amazing and it's cute as long as you have a backup!",29019,2
29020,it lasted 9 months and two of the three stopped working!,29020,2
29021,The screen printing is poor quality and folds/shapes weirdly.,29021,2
29021,I probably will ruin it when I wash it.,29021,2
29021,"Luckily we only bought this for engagement photos so I don't need it to be wearable for more than one day, because it definitely is poor quality.",29021,2
29022,"i'm 6'2 and sleeve length is 2"" short, sleeves also are too small, i rolled the cuff up but can't roll up any farther, sleeve is stuck on my forearm.",29022,2
29022,"Tight on my biceps, across back.",29022,2
29022,i guess if your 5' 120lb this shirt will fit.,29022,2
29023,"She shirt is a great price, but was very large on my fiance.",29023,2
29023,"He wears an 18.5 neck, 34-35 sleeve normally but this selection was FAR too large for him.",29023,2
29023,"It's a good price, though.",29023,2
29024,purchased for my daughters wedding.,29024,2
29024,Fit a tad small.,29024,2
29024,the problem I had is that before the ceremony was over the bottom hoop popped out of the seams and was sticking out and poking her.,29024,2
29024,Very unhappy with the construction.,29024,2
29024,I would return it but she wore it.,29024,2
29024,Very Very disappointed in the quality,29024,2
29025,I loved the look of this on the website.,29025,2
29025,But in person it's just not good.,29025,2
29025,The arms are tight but the chest and collar area bags and gapes.,29025,2
29025,(I'm 34D so I should have filled it).,29025,2
29025,The waist is also big so I could have sized down but then theres no way the arms would fit.,29025,2
29025,It's just sewn very awkwardly.,29025,2
29025,I did go by the size chart the company provided which usually works for me.,29025,2
29025,"The fabric is shiny polyester with no stretch, like costume fabric.",29025,2
29025,"Notice that there is no model trying on this dress in the picture, it's more of a catalog sketch.",29025,2
29025,Someone needs to take that sketch and rework this whole idea because it IS a pretty design on paper.,29025,2
29025,But don't buy this until.,29025,2
29026,It would be perfect with a belt or long and flow but I can't do either because it stops at my shins!!,29026,2
29026,It's lightweight but almost sheer.,29026,2
29026,"Its comfortable enough, but not enough to wear in public...",29026,2
29027,"Skirt flares out at the bottom, more like an A line skirt than a tube mini.",29027,2
29027,"Not sure if it's the cut or the material that makes it look this way, because I've owned other similar skirts this that fit fine.",29027,2
29027,Not a flattering shape.,29027,2
29028,Looks like an ole lady dress.,29028,2
29028,Do not recommend- runs incredibly large,29028,2
29029,Clips do not stay clipped on your average dress shirt.,29029,2
29029,"At least one, sometimes more than one, will pop off as you move (or sometimes even right away).",29029,2
29029,"If two on the same side cut loose, the thing falls out of your trouser leg and (with the footloop style) you have to take off your shoe to remove it or it trails along behind you on the floor.",29029,2
29029,"Also, the pics are a little misleading - anyone who recalls wearing the old ""garter belt"" fastener style stays back in our uniformed days recalls that you have to wind the things around your legs or you can't sit down without looking like you have some strange - well, some strange bungee cord under your trousers.",29029,2
29029,Which you do.,29029,2
29029,"This further increases the strap tension, especially if you're tall, which causes the clips to come unclipped faster - you get the picture.",29029,2
29029,"Good, strong elastic, strong sliders and buckles, I really wanted to like these.",29029,2
29029,But they need a better system of fastening them to your shirt.,29029,2
29030,SO so,29030,2
29031,"The shirt is made out of very thin material, if you hold it up to the light you can see through it!",29031,2
29031,It was somewhat small for a size 8.,29031,2
29031,I was expecting a better quality shirt from Disney.,29031,2
29032,"Long time coming, seems to work alright.",29032,2
29033,The lining is much shorter than it appears in the picture.,29033,2
29034,To small and feels cheap,29034,2
29035,EDIT : DONT LAST MORE THAN A COUPLE WEARS!,29035,2
29035,THE RIBBON FALLS OFF THE CLIP!,29035,2
29035,Items are exactly as pictured and look adorable in my 1 year olds head!,29035,2
29035,They stay put and don't slip off and don't hurt her either or catch hair in them.,29035,2
29035,Shipping took foreeeeeever though.,29035,2
29035,I've ordered international before and shipping didn't take a month so that was a shock that it actually took the entire time estimated to arrive on the very last day of the estimate,29035,2
29036,Way too small and not like the picture.,29036,2
29037,Not water resistant,29037,2
29038,When I got it the case was collapsed.,29038,2
29038,When I looked at the frames they seemed fake and not at all the quality of the ray ban product I typically get over the counter at Lenscrafters.,29038,2
29038,The frame was also slightly damaged.,29038,2
29039,"It does run small, and the arm holes are cut very low.",29039,2
29039,"Unless you want your bra or undershirt (or a lot of sideboob) to show, you may not be happy with it.",29039,2
29039,Would not order again from this manufacturer.,29039,2
29040,"Very thin, see thru.",29040,2
29040,Not a great quality.,29040,2
29040,Fits tight and kinda long,29040,2
29041,It's pretty damn small and cheap looking.,29041,2
29042,"I have the UpSpring Belly Band and LOVE it, so I was very excited to try this panty after my C-Section.",29042,2
29042,"I thought the price was outrageous for one pair of underwear, but was willing to give it a try if it would help the recovery process.",29042,2
29042,I followed the advice given in the reviews to order the correct size.,29042,2
29042,"When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it fit extremely tight around the leg holes - to the point that it was very uncomfortable.",29042,2
29042,"The part of the panty that went across my belly was nice because it kept my clothes from rubbing against my incision, but I didn't feel like it was at all tight enough through that part to offer any kind of support.",29042,2
29042,"I ended up using Spanx that I already had and I felt like that worked just as well, if not better.",29042,2
29043,Broke after a day but still look nice .,29043,2
29044,Had a rip on the shoulder,29044,2
29045,The picture of the shirt was much better compared to the real shirt.,29045,2
29045,I'm not happy with the fit either and I can't afford to exchange it for a different style.,29045,2
29045,So I lost a little over $20.,29045,2
29046,"So thin, too small, and you can see threw them",29046,2
29047,"I'm a size 12 and mediums usually fit, especially if there's a flare to the dress, but not this time.",29047,2
29047,It's a pretty dress but if you have any curves you should order a size up.,29047,2
29048,The hem around the edge looks sloppy and uneven and the color is MUCH lighter than the picture - more of a sky blue than a French blue.,29048,2
29049,"Super cute picture, but the reality doesn't match up.",29049,2
29049,"The adhesive which attaches the backing to the domed plastic obscures the eyes of the cat, so what you have is a pendant of a black blob.",29049,2
29049,The eyes are barely visible.,29049,2
29049,Only giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the low price.,29049,2
29049,This would be a PRECIOUS necklace if the maker took a moment to check the final product.,29049,2
29049,Just imagine the picture without eyes.,29049,2
29049,So disappointing.,29049,2
29050,"Just received, not as cute as the picture, but it will be worn...",29050,2
29051,Disappointed - not entirely as pictured.,29051,2
29051,"The first time I ordered this, it was missing from the package that was delivered.",29051,2
29051,"The second time I ordered one, it actually did get shipped to me but I am disappointed in the quality.",29051,2
29051,"The little ""swirls"" around the curve of the ring do not visually stand out as much as they do in the picture, if you ask me.",29051,2
29051,"Also, one of the ""points"" is kind of squished so that the design does not look symmetrical.",29051,2
29051,I took a picture while holding the ring up to a light so that you can see how it appears to be malformed.,29051,2
29051,"If such a defect doesn't matter to you, then feel free to try to order one.",29051,2
29051,"Otherwise, I feel you'd be taking a chance - if these are mass-produced then they may all have the same defect.",29051,2
29052,way to transparent,29052,2
29053,Fits very awkwardly.,29053,2
29053,I ignored reviews because it was cheap and I have a short torso so I thought it'd be fine but I honestly am not comfortable wearing it.,29053,2
29054,It's not exactly a push up top.,29054,2
29054,The pads are visible when you wear it.,29054,2
29054,"It just wasn't the material I was expecting, but for the price it wasn't horrible.",29054,2
29055,After reading other reviews and size chart I decided to purchase a medium.,29055,2
29055,The top was huge and the bottoms were tight.,29055,2
29055,"Mind you I'm 5'2, 120 lbs.",29055,2
29055,The print was nice.,29055,2
29055,The top was very thin and the padding did practically nothing.,29055,2
29055,Looked very cheap made.,29055,2
29055,"But, I guess for the price you get what you pay for.",29055,2
29055,"Deal or not, not worth it.",29055,2
29056,The look the color and the sleeve length of this blazer but it was too small and the actual length of the jacket was too short.,29056,2
29056,It was almost sized like a crop top blazer.,29056,2
29057,Initially liked this product very much.,29057,2
29057,Nicely appointed and well built with good fit/finish.,29057,2
29057,Classy piece.,29057,2
29057,"However, 2 stars because after only a year one of the two motors no longer works.",29057,2
29057,These devices are far too expensive to begin with - there's no excuse for them to stop working after only a year.,29057,2
29058,Was in love with the idea.,29058,2
29058,"Bought a M/L as a 5'7"" woman.",29058,2
29058,They still were short.,29058,2
29059,"It's pretty, in design.",29059,2
29059,"But it hangs really low, making it massively bulky and very unattractive.",29059,2
29060,I think this was made for a 400 pound man's neck.,29060,2
29060,I'm of medium build and this is WAY too big for a woman's neck.,29060,2
29061,The necklace turned ugly after two days.,29061,2
29062,Necklace opens while wearing it.,29062,2
29062,"I almost lost it a few times, but it was only a few dollars",29062,2
29063,This dress is cute but it runs super super big .,29063,2
29063,I ordered a small and it was huge on me.,29063,2
29064,The graphics on the front were already peeling off.,29064,2
29064,"It was an odd fit and felt cheap, not very cute",29064,2
29065,Very disappointed by the size.,29065,2
29065,This is not US size 3XL.,29065,2
29065,After looking for over a year for a good looking baseball jersey.,29065,2
29065,I get a brand that does does fit me.,29065,2
29065,Very disappointed.,29065,2
29066,"If you have any body fat at all, I would steer you away from this swimsuit.",29066,2
29066,"I followed the sizing chart and ordered a 3xl (I wear a size 14, for reference) and this suit was ridiculously small.",29066,2
29066,"I couldn't even get the top up to my chest all the way, and I am not tall by any means (5'4"").",29066,2
29066,The side straps on the hip were too tight and caused my hip fat to dunlap out and look extremely unpleasant.,29066,2
29066,":( This is not made for plus sized women, even though that's what they labeled it as.",29066,2
29066,"The only upside was that the construction of the suit was well made, so if you are a smaller girl, this may fit you well and last you the summer.",29066,2
29067,"These swimsuits look super cute in the photo, but I did not find it flattering what-so-ever!",29067,2
29067,"I'm 5'7"", 195lbs., DD cup.",29067,2
29067,The top fit okay...,29067,2
29067,It's not as skimpy as others I've tried on.,29067,2
29067,But the bottoms.. OMG.,29067,2
29067,"I put it on, looked in the mirror, and laughed out loud.",29067,2
29067,It accented my belly in a way that made me look like an old lady in a vintage swimsuit.,29067,2
29067,Saggy tummy and all!,29067,2
29067,I think this would look great on someone with more of an hourglass shape.. or if you're into waist training with corsets.,29067,2
29067,But I couldn't do it.,29067,2
29067,Had to return.,29067,2
29068,Too small,29068,2
29069,"This shirt is really short in the back, close to 4 inches of my back was exposed.",29069,2
29069,Yet the rest of the shirt was huge.,29069,2
29069,Not at all what I was looking for.,29069,2
29070,Does not fit as well as other shirts of this brand.,29070,2
29071,"Very flimsy, no support, all fat hangs out at the top so I can't wear it under any clothes, plastic boning (plastic boning doesn't aid in waist training), and made in China.",29071,2
29071,It barely was long enough for me and I'm 5'2.,29071,2
29072,"Too big in the waist, too tight in the calves",29072,2
29073,Only one of the three fit somewhat like a compression shirt.,29073,2
29073,The other two were too big.,29073,2
29073,"Otherwise, the material and feel is good.",29073,2
29074,The top is too wide.,29074,2
29074,I will be sending it back.,29074,2
29074,It very cute otherwise,29074,2
29075,"This is a really cute top, love the pattern, but a few problems.",29075,2
29075,It is very tiny in the bust area.,29075,2
29075,Not good at all for big chested women.,29075,2
29075,"Also, very short in length, would have to be worn win leggings or something, way too short for a dress.",29075,2
29075,Ended up giving this one to my teenage daughter.,29075,2
29075,Way too tiny for me.,29075,2
29075,I am usually an adult medium and I ordered an XL and it was still too tiny.,29075,2
29075,"Also, the little decorative balls around the neckline only go half way around, so looks kind of funny that it's not completed.",29075,2
29076,"Cute for a small gift, however the overall feel and look is rather cheap.",29076,2
29077,Looked nothing like photo.,29077,2
29077,It's just ok. A lot thicker than expected and not flowy at all,29077,2
29078,"I knew it wasn't real gold, but it looked a lot  better when I put it on and I really liked it.",29078,2
29078,"However, the weight of the pendant wasn't heavy enough and I lost it the first day I wore it.",29078,2
29078,So disappointed.,29078,2
29079,For the price paid they should have lasted longer then a couple of months.,29079,2
29079,My son got these for his birthday Nov 11 and by mid Dec  the colored design was already wearing off and the stitching is coming undone by the toes.,29079,2
29079,He still likes them but they should  have held up better.,29079,2
29079,then less than 30 days,29079,2
29080,I bought this item and didn't know it was a sparkly and poor quality material.,29080,2
29080,"I immediately returned the item and Amazon sent it BACK TO ME claiming that ""it looked used.""",29080,2
29080,Maybe you should make note of the initial quality of the material before accusing customers of fraud.,29080,2
29081,very fragile,29081,2
29082,Didn't like the way it fit.,29082,2
29083,Cute bikini.,29083,2
29083,"I followed the size chart, ordered a large, which looked like a large in children's :(.",29083,2
29083,Will be returning it.,29083,2
29083,Received time was very good.,29083,2
29084,Worked alright for the first few weeks.,29084,2
29084,I have the lulu lemon mat so maybe since its heavier its too much for it to handle.,29084,2
29085,Way smaller than it should be.,29085,2
29086,order came super fast so thanks for that.,29086,2
29086,tried it on and the bottoms are too big and the top is way too small.,29086,2
29086,i ordered a large.,29086,2
29087,"Much larger than anticipated, hangs very low and touches my lips.",29087,2
29088,The bracelet stretched too much and after wearing for one to two days it is too large.,29088,2
29089,Looks the same as expected except it has sharp pcs of irregular shaped metal on the inside.,29089,2
29089,I have not worn it because of sharp spots,29089,2
29090,"Way too small, especially in the chest.",29090,2
29090,"If you're a 14, the XL will NOT fit you.",29090,2
29091,Asian sizes are way smaller than American sizes,29091,2
29092,I was not expecting high quality when I ordered it for less than $10.,29092,2
29092,But I wasn't prepared to see such low quality.,29092,2
29092,I won't be wearing this and will most likely return it.,29092,2
29092,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that I love the concept of it, and I love the colors.",29092,2
29092,A designer could have adapted this and made it really cool.,29092,2
29092,But the shawl I received...not cool.,29092,2
29093,Broke almost immediately.,29093,2
29094,It broke,29094,2
29095,I give it a 2 star because it's a little tight fit.,29095,2
29095,It's made of stretchy material and very thin.,29095,2
29095,I'm afraid to dry in the dryer because it might shrink even smaller.,29095,2
29095,I'm 5' 105lbs and it's still too tight for me to wear comfortably to the office.,29095,2
29095,I would recommend getting 1 size up if you planned on purchasing this.,29095,2
29095,It's a one piece material - cheaply made.,29095,2
29096,Extremely cheap quality.,29096,2
29097,I returned these as they were not true to size.,29097,2
29097,They ran large.,29097,2
29098,"Really small, but cute.",29098,2
29099,Not long enough to tuck in,29099,2
29100,It stretches and runs big,29100,2
29101,THe straps seem to fall off no matter what you do to tighten them.,29101,2
29101,Super annoying.,29101,2
29102,Not a huge fan of this skirt at all.,29102,2
29102,Pretty color but 100% see through.,29102,2
29102,"Wouldn't order from them again, I need thicker skirts!",29102,2
29102,!,29102,2
29103,"The shirt itself is cute, but I don't dig the armholes being so large so I'm returning it for that reason.",29103,2
29104,Was way too tight on the bottom and tiny on the top.,29104,2
29104,I have a 34C and wear a size 6 pant so I ordered a Medium.,29104,2
29104,I am fairly proportional but it just didn't fit me right.,29104,2
29104,Cute though!,29104,2
29105,"Although the quality and look are very nice, this is not your typical backpack.",29105,2
29105,"It's smaller, perhaps less than half the size of a normal backpack.",29105,2
29105,"The descriptions states ""you can carry books ..."".",29105,2
29105,"Yes, a couple of paperback novels maybe.",29105,2
29105,My daughter really like this style.,29105,2
29105,I wish they made it larger.,29105,2
29105,Showing the dimensions on product description would have helped to better inform my buying decision.,29105,2
29106,Bad quality,29106,2
29107,"The color was listed as red, when it came in, it was more orange than red.",29107,2
29108,The photo is misleading!!!,29108,2
29108,The bag is waaayyyy much smaller.,29108,2
29108,I am very disappointed.,29108,2
29108,I gave it 2 stars because of the inner shoulder bag and the purse.,29108,2
29109,Bought this as a gift.,29109,2
29109,Fit fine when initially tried on --- but on Day 1 of wearing it my mom felt something scratchy on one leg.,29109,2
29109,It seems to be a patched hole.,29109,2
29109,Looks like something was ironed on or a clear material like glue was applied and allowed to harden so that the hole would appear closed and not widen.,29109,2
29109,If she picks it off there will definitely be a hole.,29109,2
29109,"Of course, this was not visible/apparent until all of the packing material and info on how to make a return was thrown in the trash.",29109,2
29109,Disappointing because it seem clear that the hole was detected and intentionally patched.,29109,2
29110,does not fit XL.,29110,2
29110,SUPER SMALL.,29110,2
29110,AND CHART SIZE IS IN ACCURATE OR IT WOULD FIT.,29110,2
29110,BUT IT IS CUTE BATHING SUIT BUT SIZES RUN SMALL!,29110,2
29110,DISAPPOINTED.,29110,2
29111,I'm not a large person and these fit great on my thigh!,29111,2
29111,I may buy a pair just for all my size zero friends or for my teddy bears to wear.,29111,2
29112,It made me smile when I opened it up.,29112,2
29112,Great ring for a penny.,29112,2
29112,The fit is perfect and it arrived before it's delivery time.,29112,2
29113,it's not like the picture!!,29113,2
29113,!,29113,2
29114,The straps are a little longer than I'd like but it's doable.,29114,2
29114,It comes with light padding but it's very stiff so I just pulled it out and replaced it.,29114,2
29114,I'm 5'4'& 145lbs ordered a size Medium,29114,2
29115,I ordered up but this item was still entirely too small.,29115,2
29115,Nice color though.,29115,2
29115,The fabric seemed a little cheap but I would have worked with it if the size was accurate.,29115,2
29116,"This would look great on someone with a great tight, fit body.",29116,2
29116,Even with spanks it is not a forgiving dress.,29116,2
29116,Pretty dress but it just didn't work for me.,29116,2
29117,its cute but small on me.,29117,2
29117,Ill be returning it,29117,2
29118,I didn't get the color I ordered.,29118,2
29118,"The neckline came up too high, not as shown in photo.",29118,2
29118,I gave it to a friend who liked it.,29118,2
29119,"I agree, something just isn't quite right with this swimsuit.",29119,2
29119,The material is not what I expected along with the quality.,29119,2
29119,It appears that the suit was recently stitched and it didn't come with a panty liner protector to prevent others from trying it on.,29119,2
29119,Just weird!,29119,2
29120,One sting broke on the side the first time I tried them on.,29120,2
29120,Was very sad.,29120,2
29120,Very sexy thong.,29120,2
29121,Some what too big.. it was short in my torso.,29121,2
29121,It needs to be longer.,29121,2
29121,I have a long torso.,29121,2
29122,"It is a slim and tight fit, and the quality is not great.",29122,2
29122,It's very thin and just doesn't drape off the body very well.,29122,2
29122,"I really wanted this to work out, but I had to return it.",29122,2
29123,This just arrived today.,29123,2
29123,I was so disappointed when I opened the package and saw that the flowers on the top were different sizes.,29123,2
29123,One is much larger than the other.,29123,2
29123,"It will cost be more to run to the ""local"" UPS store (it's over an hour round trip from my home) than the item cost.",29123,2
29124,It is not a adult XL,29124,2
29125,2nd time ordering this.,29125,2
29125,"Ordered a xl, looks like someone removed the orginal  tag and sewed in an xl tag.",29125,2
29125,It was the sane as the large.,29125,2
29125,Nice shirt dress,29125,2
29126,Returning them,29126,2
29127,Broke after one drop on carpet,29127,2
29128,The costume is fine but it would be nice if it would've come with everyone it said it was supposed to.,29128,2
29128,"I'm missing the headband, bracelets and boot covers and can't find a way to contact the seller.",29128,2
29128,Awesome.,29128,2
29129,I was looking forward to this necklace but it was not how I imagine it.,29129,2
29129,The chain are thicker than the picture and therefore it looks too busy on my neck.,29129,2
29129,The chain feels cheap and irritate against my skin.,29129,2
29129,I am going to remove the chain and change it do individual pieces to eliminate the busy look it gives with the 3 layer chains.,29129,2
29130,Picture is not of actual dress but of a Vera Wang Josephine.,29130,2
29130,It arrived damaged and the fabric is terrible.,29130,2
29130,The bodice is nice though.,29130,2
29130,The skirt is awful.,29130,2
29131,I hate the necklace it is so big on my neck and i am heavy.,29131,2
29131,I don't like it,29131,2
29132,I sadly had to send it back because I could not pulled it up.,29132,2
29132,The waist needs to have an elastic band for people with wide hips.,29132,2
29132,"I order XL, the legs were ok, the top was ok but I could not pulled up.",29132,2
29133,I ordered the size as it shows on the chart accordingly.,29133,2
29133,It does not fit and I contacted them for a return.,29133,2
29133,Its ridiculously expensive to send back.,29133,2
29134,Didn't like the material at all.,29134,2
29134,.Looks cheap and is nothing like the picture.,29134,2
29134,Very disappointed but I guess that's why it's so cheap.,29134,2
29135,"didn't realize that they have slits where skin is exposed, not something I want to wear in the winter.",29135,2
29136,"I love the shirt and I read reviews that the shirt runs small so I ordered at least two sizes larger to avoid disappointment, however, it was still too small.",29136,2
29137,"Pretty pendant, exactly what I was looking for.",29137,2
29137,"I've purchased it six weeks ago, and now the chain is broken.",29137,2
29138,My GF really Liked the colors but the jewelry broke in the packaging seemed like a hassle to try to return or refund.!.,29138,2
29138,please beware OK?,29138,2
29139,too small,29139,2
29140,"Poor quality, fraying after a couple of uses.",29140,2
29141,The dress just didn't look good on!,29141,2
29142,Nice print.,29142,2
29142,Too snug for my body type.,29142,2
29143,Item i received broken.,29143,2
29143,:(,29143,2
29144,Weird color.,29144,2
29144,Feels and look poor quality.,29144,2
29144,I think it is over prized.,29144,2
29145,I ordered the teal version.,29145,2
29145,"And it looked pretty cool; however, when the day came to try it on.",29145,2
29145,I realized the chain (Gold) was very light weight which is easier for the necklace to break.,29145,2
29145,By looking at the necklace and seeing the triangles are not far apart.,29145,2
29145,I believe they will break if they aren't perfectly hanging up.,29145,2
29145,I had one previously that broke from not always having it hung up.,29145,2
29145,But for this necklace so far so good,29145,2
29146,Missing a button.,29146,2
29147,I always wash the clothes before putting it on my baby.,29147,2
29147,This one shed color and it stained all her clothes.,29147,2
29147,Now i have to find some way to remove red color from her other clothes.,29147,2
29148,No support on top.,29148,2
29148,Had to return,29148,2
29149,Nothing like the picture.,29149,2
29149,"But, u get what u pay for.",29149,2
29149,I felt like Theo Cosby when he had his sister sew a knock off shirt to save money!,29149,2
29150,"Very cute little suit, but I hate all the snaps around the legs.",29150,2
29150,"Every time I put my 9 month old son in this, it's a wrestling match with aggravated protesting from him.",29150,2
29150,A zipper instead of snap closures would make this 5 stars.,29150,2
29151,"This looks pretty,but is very thin and collar won't lay right",29151,2
29152,Smaller than imagined,29152,2
29153,Ordered these and found them for cheaper and quicker shipping.,29153,2
29153,As a result tried to cancel just 40 mins after I ordered them and Under Armour refused to cancel and then I had to pay shipping to get them back to them (unopened!).,29153,2
29153,Won't buy from them directly again.,29153,2
29154,Wayyyyy too short.,29154,2
29154,You will wear this as a shirt,29154,2
29155,"the plug is not easily inserted with peace in the shoes , so hard to plug it",29155,2
29156,"Should have ordered an XL for my 5'9"", 135# son.",29156,2
29157,Eh... the material is very thin and not flattering at all.,29157,2
29158,"Bows are very cute, but one arrived covered in some kind of dirt/mold.",29158,2
29158,"Babies are due any day, so there isn't time for a return :(",29158,2
29159,We purchased these for my 4.5 year old son.,29159,2
29159,We typically buy Carter's pjs in 5T and they fit great.,29159,2
29159,These are cut very strangely.,29159,2
29159,"They supposed to fit tight, but are much smaller that I would expect.",29159,2
29159,The crotch hangs very low and the sleeves are short.,29159,2
29160,"Little snug on my wrist, but then that's what extenders are for!",29160,2
29161,Took a long time to get to me and was just in a bag.,29161,2
29161,"Material was see thru and was way too small, even though I ordered a much  larger size than I normally wear.",29161,2
29161,"Cuet style and design, but I cannot wear it.",29161,2
29161,I gave it to my young niece.,29161,2
29161,she will have to wear a camy under it.,29161,2
29162,I REALLY wanted to love this dress; the pink dress is very colorful with the design around the neck BUT the fabric is horrible!,29162,2
29162,It's very stiff and actually feels like a tablecloth.,29162,2
29162,The arm and neck holes are a little snug which is odd since the overall dress is loose fitting by design.,29162,2
29162,I am bummed as I love the colors and really wanted to like it.,29162,2
29162,"For the price, I will keep it and see if washing it softens it up some but I doubt it will help.",29162,2
29162,"Its also lined with something that feels like it should be a waterproofing liner of some sort, which makes it cling oddly in places and just feels bad overall.",29162,2
29162,"Oh well, its pretty to look at.",29162,2
29163,This shirt was completely see through!,29163,2
29163,In the advertised pictures it shows an under shirt attached well in real life this is also 100% see through,29163,2
29164,"way too small, even though i went for a much bigger size.",29164,2
29164,seller did refund $4 instead of a return,29164,2
29165,Cute skirt but runs way to small or the seller sent the wrong size!!,29165,2
29165,"Definitely not worth the price, material is very thin.",29165,2
29166,One strap was sewn twisted in the back...,29166,2
29167,I was so excited to get this package.,29167,2
29167,But when I put it in the fit was not as described.,29167,2
29168,Cute but much larger beads than I expected.,29168,2
29168,Looks like Wilma flinstone's necklace on little girls neck.,29168,2
29168,But she loves it anyway.,29168,2
29169,Didn't work for what I was intending it for.,29169,2
29169,Way too large.,29169,2
29169,Doesn't have free returns bc you have to pay shipping.,29169,2
29169,Keeping it bc the hat is almost as much to return it as it was to originally buy it.,29169,2
29170,The quality seems good but the size is awkward.,29170,2
29170,It's much smaller across the shoulders & in the arms than you would expect for length & width of the base.,29170,2
29170,Overall it was a disappointment.,29170,2
29171,"Although I have ordered other Pattty Boutik tops that I love, this top was not one of them.",29171,2
29171,It looks adorable in the picture but does not look like that on.,29171,2
29171,"I wore it yesterday to a party and had difficulty just figuring out how to best tie it due to the fact that both of the sides are the same length so when I tie it to the side one part hangs long and the other very short, unlike in the picture.",29171,2
29171,"In addition, the top was driving me crazy throughout the party.",29171,2
29171,It kept sliding up in the front and back exposing my abdomen and I had to keep readjusting it.,29171,2
29171,On top of that when I would readjust it I later found out that the wrap around part wasn't evenly covering the shirt in the back which did not look nice.,29171,2
29171,I also felt that it did not lay nicely in the front as it does on the model in the picture.,29171,2
29171,"I'm so disappointed because I really wanted a top like this but it is way too much work, it definitely could have been designed better!",29171,2
29172,I had to send it back.,29172,2
29172,This looks like such a cute summer dress and I was looking forward to it but it is too small.,29172,2
29172,I ordered the xxl because I don't like figure hugging but it was the smallest xxl I have ever seem.,29172,2
29172,I knew it would be an issue when I took it out of the tiny bag it came in.,29172,2
29172,"The material was awful too, it's my fault that I didn't look to see what it was made of.",29172,2
29172,"It's very lightweight, thin and clingy material.",29172,2
29172,Maybe if I were a size 4?,29172,2
29173,Pretty but didn't fit at all.,29173,2
29173,I have to send them back.,29173,2
29173,I thought they would be more adjustable than they are but there isn't too much give.,29173,2
29173,"I'm too afraid to open them up anymore, I don't want them to break.",29173,2
29173,It's a shame these don't come in a range of sizes.,29173,2
29174,"The shirt construction is fine, but the size was VERY out of sync with U.S. sizing.",29174,2
29174,"We ordered for an XL adult size, but the XXL shirt that was shipped was SO under-sized, it wouldn't have fit a 9-year-old.",29174,2
29174,Remediation was made by the vendor.,29174,2
29175,"Fabric is beautiful, but dress is not adequately lined.",29175,2
29176,"i did not like this at all, the material was cheap.",29176,2
29176,so cheap it looked shiny.,29176,2
29176,"the top is okay, but if you have bigger breasts, DO NOT BUY THIS.",29176,2
29176,I am a small B and i got a medium and I almost popped out.,29176,2
29176,"I was very disappointed with the quality, that's the biggest let down.",29176,2
29177,I didn't like the handbag.,29177,2
29177,It looked every bit of fake.,29177,2
29177,Took forever to get to me.,29177,2
29177,Didn't want to wasted the money to send it back..,29177,2
29177,I just gave it to my mom...,29177,2
29178,Sad to see the 'beads' were plastic although marketed as 'Amber'.,29178,2
29178,":-( As well, the Om charm was of very low quality metal, just to fade to copper.",29178,2
29178,Thanks anyways...,29178,2

29184,I ordered a large and I wear a D cup.,29184,2
29184,This did no even barley fit around both of my boobs but instead they both hung out the side along with looking like a unaboob.,29184,2
29184,If you are smaller chested I would order a size up or maybe even the largest size.,29184,2
29184,"I was not happy with this product, even matched with size chart and was not comparable.",29184,2
29184,The bottoms as well to not fit true to size and run just as small as the top.,29184,2

29189,I wore it always in my pocket and I don't think I mishandled it.,29189,2
29189,Watch appearance and its weight are very good and I would have given 4 or 5 stars if it didn't break down.,29189,2
29189,It still works and it's accurate but I am not able to change the time anymore.,29189,2
29190,The fit was too small in the bust and arm area.,29190,2

29212,I guess I have a longer torso but this corset is a little small length wise.,29212,2

29253,"Very small, ordered 3 xxl.",29253,2
29253,Looks like little kid can wear it.,29253,2
29254,ok,29254,2
29255,CHEAPLY MADE...,29255,2
29255,RAN VERY SMALL,29255,2
29256,The style and fit is nice.,29256,2
29256,"The dress is made just fine, but I would prefer a better fabric.",29256,2
29256,This is made from a cotton tee-shirt material that will fade easily and is slightly see through.,29256,2
29256,"I did not realize from the picture that there is a cross over, basket weave type of design on the front that I kind of like.",29256,2
29257,"The skirt flows very nicely, but the top was bigger than it should be.",29257,2
29257,I felt like it wasn't coordinated in a correct way so I had to return,29257,2
29258,I'm a huge PlayStation fan so this was pretty disappointing to see this marked as an official PlayStation product.,29258,2
29258,The wallet itself is okay but the decals on the outside look like iron-on stickers and I can tell they are not going to last long.,29258,2
29258,Had they been stitched I would have been totally happy.,29258,2
29259,This shirt is a very strange fit.,29259,2
29259,"It's too large in the body, the arms are very tight, and the shoulders are pointed - I felt like I should have spikes sticking out of my shoulders.",29259,2
29259,The fabric also is fairly see through.,29259,2
29259,"I didn't realize when ordering that this came from China, had I known that I never would have ordered it.",29259,2
29260,Material is see through and cheaply made but it works if you have something to wear under it.,29260,2
29261,Very cheaply made.,29261,2
29262,"I wear a size 10.5 shoe, and these are small on me.",29262,2
29262,"I was able to wear all pairs, but some take some creative maneuvering to get them over my heels (others are snug but easily doable).",29262,2
29262,The socks are also a little thin/cheap.,29262,2
29262,"For what you get it's a good price, but wouldn't expect these to last forever.",29262,2
29263,The print on this dress is cute but the fabric is thin and very unforgiving of you have any belly fat.,29263,2
29263,I'm pretty petite but have a slight baby pooch and this dress did nothing to conceal yet reveal.,29263,2
29263,I wish the fabric would be thicker or at least have some lining at the bottom portion.,29263,2
29263,I'm returning the dress,29263,2
29264,It was cute but very thin.,29264,2
29264,It broke within the first two weeks after it snagged in a sweater.,29264,2
29265,Made in China not the same quality of cotton like those made in USA .,29265,2
29265,Made much more narrow too!,29265,2
29266,Bought on May 16 of last year and the inside of wallet is falling apart,29266,2
29267,I usually wear a small and this was just plain tiny.,29267,2
29268,Threw it out because the armpits were too tight.,29268,2
29269,My daughter wears an extra large so knowing they run small I ordered a 3XL.,29269,2
29269,A 3XL fit a friend of mine who is 5' tall and weighs 120lbs.,29269,2
29269,They are extremely SMALL but the quality is great!,29269,2
29269,The shirt was extremely soft and would be comfortable if only it fit.... My friend loves it.,29269,2
29270,"The large was too tight, ordered and received the XL and the sleeves where too short and fell into the arm pit.",29270,2
29271,"I received this item on May 2, 2016.",29271,2
29271,The spinner carry-on traveled on 2 days through airports.,29271,2
29271,By Mon.,29271,2
29271,"May 16, 2016 on the second day of travel with 29 lbs.",29271,2
29271,"of luggage, the handle broke at the airport.",29271,2
29272,No structure to this top.,29272,2
29272,It's way too big for me and the arms are long and way too wide.,29272,2
29272,"I asked the seller to refund the purchase multiple times, but still haven't heard anything back.",29272,2
29272,": ( The top is inexpensive, but so is the quality.",29272,2
29272,Wish I wouldn't have wasted the $15.,29272,2
29273,These are not leggings- these are hose.,29273,2
29273,You cannot wear these without something over them as they are see-through.,29273,2
29274,Is more small,29274,2
29275,"Cute and as expected out of the package, but buttons fell off after the first time I wore it.",29275,2
29275,"Also, the buttons don't line up as nice as it shows on Rembrandt old",29275,2
29276,5days.,29276,2
29276,The man's ring lose the dimond,29276,2
29277,This shirt is really cute but very small.,29277,2
29277,It completely shows my belly.,29277,2
29277,Pay attention to the sizing XXXL is actually a women's 12 but for someone with a very short torso.,29277,2
29277,I ended up giving it to my 10 year old daughter to wear with leggings.,29277,2
29278,"The bottom fits great and I love it, but I should have known the top would be too small based on how the fit looks on the model.",29278,2
29279,"I really wanted to like this shirt but it was way too tight, with really bad stitching.",29279,2
29279,I wore it once and the stitching came undone under the arms and also down the side.,29279,2
29279,The color is really nice and the design is great too but the material used to sew this shirt together must be really cheap.,29279,2
29280,"The charm is darker than the picture, rather dark green and blue.",29280,2
29280,It is a disappointment that picture did not reflect the true colors.,29280,2
29281,too small,29281,2
29282,After short time of usage pendants start get in bronze color!,29282,2
29282,!,29282,2
29283,"The hat is a cute style, though the material is very cheap and it arrived with permanent, deep wrinkles that won't come out with washing and ironing",29283,2
29284,I'm not thrilled about the dress.,29284,2
29284,It does not fit the way the picture shows.,29284,2
29285,Not meant for a big bust,29285,2
29286,Bought for my daughter for dress up.,29286,2
29286,Feathers all over the house.,29286,2
29286,Lesson learned.,29286,2
29287,The tail fit perfectly but the top's flowers were too far apart.,29287,2
29287,I was not able to use it.,29287,2
29287,Nobody can use it because it's too far apart.,29287,2
29287,The tail was very nice with the pearls and I used it with another top.,29287,2
29288,Everything fits good and for the most part looks good.,29288,2
29288,The one thing that bothers me is the pant's seam in the crotch area is uncomfortable and if pulled to high can cause camel top.,29288,2
29288,Not cool!,29288,2
29289,Adorable print; good fabric.,29289,2
29289,"However, not only sizing off but it gaps so widely at the top that it is hard to wear.",29289,2
29289,Giving mine away!,29289,2
29290,I ordered a size 5xl and it was still too small.,29290,2
29290,I'm a size 16 usually.,29290,2
29290,The sleeves were super tight and the shirt rides up a lot at the waist.,29290,2
29290,"Although, wearing a belt over the waist does help somewhat.",29290,2
29291,LOVED the frame but the lens looked very cheap.,29291,2
29292,"Very poor quality, but not worth searching for a replacement.",29292,2
29292,Stitching is tight so there's a puckered appearance everywhere.,29292,2
29292,Would not buy this again.,29292,2
29293,"For reference, I am 5'9, 36DD, and fit comfortably in size 8-10 pants.",29293,2
29293,The bottoms were so so cute you guys.,29293,2
29293,So flattering.,29293,2
29293,"HOWEVER, the top was ridiculously small.",29293,2
29293,Half my boob was falling out the sides!,29293,2
29293,"I really wish this bathing suit worked, but unfortunately I can't wear it without revealing myself to the world.",29293,2
29293,The top also came with small holes in the straps so I will be returning it.,29293,2
29293,"If you have a large chest, BEWARE.",29293,2
29293,You will have to order two suits to fit yours needs.,29293,2
29294,It's too small on me,29294,2
29295,Wig was too small.,29295,2
29295,Was about a half inch or more away from being near my ears (and I have an average sized head),29295,2
29296,Runs WAY small!,29296,2
29297,It was missing one of the diamonds!,29297,2
29297,and a little smaller than i expected..,29297,2

29301,"They are like thick tights, and I liked the thicker waistline but a couple hours of tugging them up because of my big behind caused runs in this material.",29301,2
29301,I had to throw them away like a bad pair of nylons.,29301,2
29302,I am returning this.,29302,2
29302,It is not right for me in any way.,29302,2
29302,I am large chested-there is no support even with underwire.,29302,2
29302,The suit is pretty but not high quality material or workmanship.,29302,2
29303,my glasses came broken i repaired them myself....love them,29303,2
29304,Overall pretty dress but top was much to small / low cut.,29304,2
29304,Ended up not even wearing this dress.,29304,2
29305,was not as pretty as the picture.,29305,2
29305,its basically just a picture with a plastic dome on top very dull.,29305,2
29305,good price though,29305,2
29306,Came apart after two weeks.,29306,2
29307,Not the best quality,29307,2
29308,The top gives you a bulge and it doesn't shape well.,29308,2
29308,Pretty tho.,29308,2
29309,Fitting is perfect !,29309,2
29309,I am somehow skinny and those pants are neither small nor big.,29309,2
29309,The reason I gave them 2 stars only is because they came with the most terrible waist band and spoiled the whole look of them !,29309,2
29309,The waist band they put on the photo is deception and never what they send you !,29309,2
29309,!,29309,2

29314,Zipper broke within a month.,29314,2

29315,Thin and see through.,29315,2
29315,Not at all what I was expecting for a tank top.,29315,2
29315,I would not recommend it.,29315,2
29316,I ordered medium and it was too small so ordered large and it was too big.,29316,2
29316,Cute blouse but had to send back.,29316,2

29319,"I ended up cutting off the tab, but it looks kind of ridiculous.",29319,2
29320,I bought these gloves to ride motorcycles in the winter.,29320,2
29320,If that's how you want to use these gloves forget about it.,29320,2
29320,These gloves are not riding gloves at all.,29320,2
29320,Nor are they windproof.,29320,2
29320,I'm very disappointed.,29320,2
29321,Too small,29321,2
29322,The front pockets aren't.,29322,2
29322,They are fake pockets.,29322,2
29322,Very very disappointing.,29322,2
29323,They light up for safety purposed but they are a little tight not he shoe.,29323,2
29323,For being tight on the shoe they keep falling off my shoes.,29323,2
29323,Not worth the purchase.,29323,2
29324,"Tooo small; i ordered large , i wear uk 12 usually it was too small, but material is good",29324,2
29325,Cheap looking!,29325,2
29325,Wouldn't recommend!,29325,2
29326,"Its cute but as 0, and I mean 0, stretch to it.",29326,2

29326,Don't waste your money.,29326,2
29327,Nose pieces fell off two pair immediately.,29327,2
29328,too big asked for medium got a larger size customer service was sorry- only offered to help after i has written a horrible review.,29328,2
29328,Thats actually why i gave them only 2 stars because the skirts are cute and i love them but too big.,29328,2
29328,stuck with 2 skirts that are too big.,29328,2
29329,Hat was very small and poorly made when mine arrived it already had strings coming out of it,29329,2
29330,Need to put the size on it,29330,2
29331,funky collar dimensions,29331,2
29332,So I ordered this jacket in brown.,29332,2
29332,At first I though they sent me the tarmac one by mistake.,29332,2
29332,"The jacket is a very dark brown, almost black.",29332,2
29332,"The hood and stitches are all brown, as depicted.",29332,2
29332,If I wanted a black jacket i would have ordered the tarmac color.,29332,2
29333,Not seamless.,29333,2
29333,My daughter will only wear seamless socks now and took them back off as soon as she felt the seam.,29333,2
29333,Do not purchase if your child has issues with seams in socks.,29333,2
29333,They are cute socks though.,29333,2
29333,"If looking for seamless, my daughter loves the ones on Amazon that look like cat faces on the side (pack of different colors).",29333,2
29334,It was way too small.,29334,2
29334,"I ordered an XL and it fit more like a M. Its very soft though, I wish it had fit!",29334,2
29335,Thigh highs more like knee high these don't go past my knees.,29335,2
29336,The pouch needs more room.,29336,2
29337,the backs of the earrings had to small of holes.,29337,2
29337,Had to use my own.,29337,2
29337,Post bent went trying to put them on.,29337,2
29338,Love this watch!,29338,2
29339,The material was ok.,29339,2
29340,too wide opening at the top and narrow at the base (inside piece).,29340,2
29340,Sold it at a benefit yard sale.,29340,2
29340,I did like the outer ;piece.,29340,2
29341,"I really love this g-string (materials used, style, look), but returned it because the Large is too small for me.",29341,2
29341,"I wish there was an XL size, but this is the only one I could find.",29341,2
29341,"If I could find it, I'd buy it.",29341,2
29341,"The pouch is too small, and it is too tight overall for my 36"" waist.",29341,2
29341,"I figured it would be, but decided to try anyway.",29341,2
29341,"If seller adds a XL, I will buy it.",29341,2
29341,TL;DR Get the next largest size up from what the size chart shows for you,29341,2
29342,Too small,29342,2
29343,Hey!,29343,2
29343,This outfit would have been super cute on me but.....,29343,2
29343,It didn't for at all.,29343,2
29343,"I am 5'5, 182 & 40D with a decent ""back side"" I ordered an extra large since I was going off of other people reviews.",29343,2
29343,It wouldn't zip up at all.,29343,2
29344,"For the price, I guess you cant complain?",29344,2
29344,"However, I would rather pay more and get something that fits.",29344,2
29344,"I ordered an XL because I am tall and in fairly good shape, not wide...not really skinny either.",29344,2
29344,The neck hole is huge and its wide.,29344,2
29344,Doesnt fit like a shirt should and it certainly isn't close to the picture.,29344,2
29344,"Feels like a shirt you would buy off the rack at a Job Lot store or something

Will likely just throw it out because its a pain to ship back...bummer",29344,2
29345,You get what you pay for.,29345,2
29345,"The medallion part is really cheap looking and the strand with the triangle hangs to the side instead of center & not in a cool, we did that on purpose way.",29345,2
29346,34x30 was the size chosen and it barely reaches the shoe.,29346,2
29346,The length of 30 maybe including the fold in the end which is not what I expected.,29346,2
29346,"The crease also slants off making the trouser look sort-of ""seconds"".",29346,2
29346,"For a woolen trouser, the fabric feel is too thin, not something I'd have assumed would suit the cold weather.",29346,2
29346,Not returning it though as I already wore it.,29346,2
29346,But may not buy again,29346,2
29347,very cheaply made with a crummy boardy waistband.,29347,2
29347,I cut the waistband out but seriously I would NOT recommend these cheapo shorts.,29347,2
29348,I was not happy with the long extra wide strap.,29348,2
29348,I am now trying to figure out how to use it without the straps separating.,29348,2
29348,Would not order it again.,29348,2
29349,I ordered a 3x.,29349,2
29349,The shirt fits like a 1x.,29349,2
29350,Not at all what I expected.,29350,2
29351,"Very small sunglasses, almost a child's size.",29351,2
29352,1st of all I'm 5'01 123lbs had my second baby 1year ago.,29352,2
29352,Been working out here n there.,29352,2
29352,"That said I order this thinking it would help my belly problem, well it didn't if anything it makes my belly look  pregnant, the material stretches to much.",29352,2
29352,The bottoms don't cover much too  small  and also the top.,29352,2
29352,"I got a size L I'm usually M. (my reason for 2 stars it did arrive early) also if u have a long torso this is ""not"" for u!",29352,2
29353,"The cut of the shirt is really cute, but the material is very thin.",29353,2
29353,Be aware that the shirt also runs small.,29353,2
29353,"I bought XL, but it is more like a US Med.",29353,2
29354,I bought a large and cant even fit into it.,29354,2
29354,I bought large rompers from other brands of this type and fit into them fine.,29354,2
29354,Design is cute and fabric is nice though,29354,2
29355,The bands do not stay together.,29355,2
29355,They are constantly hanging down even when tightened.,29355,2
29356,Too small on the top part,29356,2
29357,The size stated xxl however the product was for a very small person.,29357,2
29358,Beads fell off before I wore it.,29358,2
29359,My sister had a bridal shower to go to.,29359,2
29359,The theme was a tea party and hats... We didn't want to spend a whole lot of time looking for derby hats or alot of money.,29359,2
29359,This hat did the trick.,29359,2
29359,We were disappointed that it wasn't the same as the picture.,29359,2
29359,& it didn't come with a headband.,29359,2
29359,The only thing that was true to the picture was the color.,29359,2
29359,I'm just glad my sister settled for it.,29359,2
29359,It wasn't worth the time and hassle to do a return..,29359,2
29359,So buyers be ware.,29359,2
29359,I probably won't be buying from seller again,29359,2
29360,3xl fit like a 2xl,29360,2
29361,Not quite sure how to review this product.,29361,2
29361,I ordered one in Medium to see how it fit and what the quality was like.,29361,2
29361,"It fit my 40inch hips and 29 inch waist fine, I was happy with the quality and fit so I got 3 more as a Christmas present from my husband.",29361,2
29361,"BUT 2 of them were MUCH smaller than the others, by 2 inches in the waist and 2 inches in the length.",29361,2
29361,The skirts do not have tags of any kind inside so i cant by sure if i got sent a size smaller or if the ones that fit were a size larger.,29361,2
29361,Luckily they do stretch a LITTLE and can be worn BUT a little snug.,29361,2
29361,"Im not sure if i will return them, whats to keep it from happening again if there are no identifying tags?",29361,2
29361,And do I bother with the hassle of an overseas company?,29361,2
29361,This is not the first time i've had problems with distant sellers.,29361,2
29361,I won't be ordering from far away companies again.,29361,2
29361,I couldn't rate the sizing properly since 2 fit well and 2 didn't.,29361,2
29361,How can I reorder if i don't know what ill receive?,29361,2
29361,Very angry with the aggravation and money wasted.,29361,2
29362,"Fits large I'm 6'1"" 138 lbs and it was cut but one size too big and wish it was a little longer.",29362,2
29363,"I'm going to be honest, Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time.",29363,2
29363,Nothing can beat it.,29363,2
29363,I truly love this shirt and the idea of it is a 5.,29363,2
29363,What I don't like is the fact that I had to order it in a men's size and it still is somewhat small.,29363,2
29363,It fits really snug.,29363,2
29363,I wish that it came in women's bigger sizes.,29363,2
29363,3X just isn't enough.,29363,2
29363,"If you can make it in men's 5X, make it in women's 5X too!",29363,2
29363,I'm giving this two stars because I like the idea of the shirt and my love of the movie.,29363,2
29363,"But it is a tight fit, the back is plain, it should have a prison ID number on the back, just to make it better and because of the sizes for both men and women.",29363,2
29364,Very cute but don't fit,29364,2
29365,Pretty colors only size runs small,29365,2
29366,It's so small and doesn't cling on to my ear well so it was lost in two days after it was delivered.,29366,2
29366,Only pro i have about it is the design which looks nice,29366,2
29367,Isn't soft in the shoulder,29367,2
29368,The top did not fit at all.,29368,2
29368,But the bottoms were okay,29368,2
29369,Didn't like the material I never soften up.,29369,2
29370,Didn't fit as expected,29370,2
29371,Items are smaller than measurements listed!,29371,2
29371,!,29371,2
29372,"The size says a large but once I received it, boy was it waaaaay huge.",29372,2
29372,Pretty much a 2XL.,29372,2
29372,I like the style/design of the shirt but the sizes are not expected.,29372,2
29372,I was very unhappy.,29372,2
29373,the bottom was terrible when it got wet.,29373,2
29373,the belt didn't stay put,29373,2
29374,"I thought it was going to fit me as my usual shirts do, but it ended up been so small and short when i tried it on.",29374,2
29375,I've got to stop buying from Asian firms whose sizing is completely different than here in America.,29375,2
29376,These lasted for about a week and then developed a hole where the wrist is.,29376,2
29376,I use them every morning for literally 15 minutes while I walk the dog so they aren't used heavily.,29376,2
29376,I would recommend another glove.,29376,2
29377,shipped flat.,29377,2
29377,quality not great,29377,2
29378,These sweatpants are huge and bulky.,29378,2
29378,Order at least one size down.,29378,2
29379,Very flimsy and bend easily,29379,2
29380,After reading other reviews I ordered a size up from what the sizing chart suggested.,29380,2
29380,The leg holes were so tight and the torso was very short.,29380,2
29380,"I'm 5'6"", about 150lb and ordered an XL.",29380,2
29380,The style of the suit is super cute but just didn't work for me.,29380,2
29381,"The holes for arms are very small and different from each other by an inch,  couldn't put the dress on, couldn't get my arms through.",29381,2
29381,"The dress it's self is OK,  nothing special.",29381,2
29382,Very poor quality!,29382,2
29382,Kind a small and flatten!,29382,2
29382,The pictures look a lot nicer and the feather on the hat I got it's short and flat.,29382,2
29382,I've been trying to make this hat look like the picture but I just can't!,29382,2
29382,Its not manageable!,29382,2
29382,The fiber is kind a falling apart on the edges.,29382,2
29383,Youth extra large fit my daughter like a dress and she wears a girls 14-16.,29383,2
29384,nice for the girls play grown-up,29384,2
29385,Bad quality belt not what i expected the buckle is the only thing im saving to put in a real leather belt,29385,2
29386,I brought this for my 3 year old the quality is good but the bracelet is small it barely fits her wrist,29386,2
29387,"everything is fine except too small, I have already plan to return it back",29387,2
29388,Ordered a large.,29388,2
29388,"I usually wear a medium so I ordered up, but this shirt is much shorter than the picture!",29388,2
29388,It fits like a small.,29388,2
29388,I am going to keep it to give to my niece.,29388,2
29388,I would order 2 sizes up.,29388,2
29388,"The color is as pictured, sleeves are so cute!",29388,2
29388,Nice quality fabric.,29388,2
29389,Sleeves to short,29389,2
29390,I like the material and how they fit but I wore them for the second time today and they have runs in them.,29390,2
29390,"When I washed them, I laid hem flat to dry and I was careful when putting them on.",29390,2
29390,Disappointed.,29390,2
29391,I got a size I nomally get and this shirt is made in China.,29391,2
29391,I have better luck with the Pakistan made shirts.,29391,2
29391,The size is a little tight.,29391,2
29391,Not a sit down shirt.,29391,2
29391,But it looks great and has a great length.,29391,2
29392,"Stopped working after about a week

****UPDATE****
I was contacted by the seller after leaving review and received a new watch.",29392,2
29392,It works but the app that goes with it is useless.,29392,2
29392,"I can't change any of the settings, like time format or unit of measurement.",29392,2
29393,Not as delicate looking as the picture shows.,29393,2
29393,Was bigger chain and triangle - overall clunky.,29393,2
29394,Looks great but broke very easily just wearing it on my vest after a couple months,29394,2
29395,I bought this for post partum purposes.,29395,2
29395,"Over all,I would not recommend this product.",29395,2
29395,"The band's material is stiff and folds/buckles in areas when being worn, which looks terrible under clothes.",29395,2
29395,"Also, I'm long waists and it does not cover my entire stomach.",29395,2
29395,It's cheaply made.,29395,2
29395,You'd be better off getting spambot an simply wrapping an ace bandage.arubd your waste.,29395,2
29396,Fell apart almost immediately.,29396,2
29396,I was able to use part of the necklace on another.,29396,2
29396,Just really crappy quality.,29396,2
29397,I was disappointed this was a single strap instead of two.,29397,2
29398,"It fits OK but no matter what hook u have it on, it rolls excessively and the boning sticks you in your sides which was extremely painful.",29398,2
29398,Waste of money,29398,2
29399,The pocket was ripped upon arrival.,29399,2
29399,I was not happy with the product being damaged.,29399,2
29400,"Wasn't true to size, cheap material looks MUCH different than the picture!",29400,2
29401,The fabric its not good at all,29401,2
29402,Disappointed.,29402,2
29402,"This is the scratchy, stiff kind of petticoat, not the soft fluffy chiffon like the photo shows.",29402,2
29402,"It does have a lining so it's not a total waste, but it was not at all what I wanted.",29402,2
29402,I will probably keep it for the time being until I can find what I need.,29402,2
29403,The look of this hat is very nice.,29403,2
29403,But the quality if it is not what I expected.,29403,2
29403,"It is brittle, and did not last me 2 weeks.",29403,2
29403,Ive had better Rosarito bought hats that have lasted me half a year if not more.,29403,2
29404,Length of sleeve short,29404,2
29405,These socks do not stay up very well.,29405,2
29406,It looked as expected but was very cheaply made.,29406,2
29406,But the quality matches the price.,29406,2
29407,Didnt like the feel of it.,29407,2
29407,It also had a weird smell to it.,29407,2
29408,Based on my typical experience shopping online I always like to buy a size larger because it never fails it will be too small otherwise.,29408,2
29408,Based on reviews of it being too big I went with my regular size XL and WOW it was huge!,29408,2
29408,I have a large chest 38DD also wear a size 14 and it was just hanging off me.,29408,2
29408,So I returned for a L and WOW way too small.,29408,2
29408,I got it up to my hips and then after that it went no farther!,29408,2
29408,I really love this romper it is super cute!,29408,2
29408,Since it didn't fit me I can't attest to the hold up of wear and wash!,29408,2
29409,"It's cute and stylish, but if you have an ounce of curve it will be short :(",29409,2
29410,"I bought this secondary to an identical styled dress, different in color only.",29410,2
29410,"However, this dress, while marked XXL just like the first, is NOT the same size.",29410,2
29410,I'm very disappointed.,29410,2
29411,arrived with a dead battery,29411,2
29412,Poor material,29412,2
29413,You get what you pay for.,29413,2
29413,This cheap suit looks and feels cheap.,29413,2
29414,What a bummer!,29414,2
29414,The dress is GORGEOUS!,29414,2
29414,But sadly it is too small.,29414,2
29414,Defiantly size up if you're going to buy this dress,29414,2
29415,Was a little cheesy,29415,2
29416,I need this umbrella for a costume that I'm making  and it arrived filthy all over and the handle was bent.,29416,2
29416,"I will repurchase one,  as this is exactly what I need and I cannot find it elsewhere, but would not recommend unless you don't mind returning things.",29416,2
29416,Hoping the new one will be better quality.,29416,2
29417,Very CHEAP broke the first time my daughter put them on.,29417,2
29417,She loves them but I had to completely redo the clasps and chain parts.,29417,2
29418,to small to fit all the hair,29418,2
29419,Too big.,29419,2
29420,Good thing I bought these as a joke costume.,29420,2
29420,Runs REALLY small  Pretty cheap.,29420,2
29420,You get what you pay for!,29420,2
29421,It runs really small so I only used it twice at best.,29421,2
29421,Not worth the purchase.,29421,2
29422,Pretty but color is changing to bronze,29422,2
29423,the fit is ridiculous,29423,2
29424,Too tight,29424,2
29425,So I ordered this dress in red in a medium.,29425,2
29425,When it arrived I was nicely surprised.,29425,2
29425,The color and quality were very nice.,29425,2
29425,The only issue was the fit.,29425,2
29425,"I am a size 4 but based on size charts I got the medium, and it was too big.",29425,2
29425,I liked the dress so I purchased another in a small.,29425,2
29425,The dress was garbage.,29425,2
29425,The back of the dress/ skirt is shorter than the front!,29425,2
29425,Also there is a band that goes around the circle of the dress and it doesn't align meaning the dress wasn't cut properly when it was manufactured.,29425,2
29425,It's like a factory second.,29425,2
29425,"Also, the fabric and color is completely different than the size medium.",29425,2
29425,"All that said, I like the dress so I ordered another small to see what I get and am returning the other 2.",29425,2
29425,I will post pics to show the difference.,29425,2
29425,I am truly hoping the third Time is the charm.,29425,2
29425,Will update review after I receive it.,29425,2
29426,"It isn't orange, more of a rust color.",29426,2
29426,"Unfortunately, I waited too long before trying to return it, so I will be donating it to charity.",29426,2
29426,"Lesson learned:  if you don't love it right out of the box, you are never going to like it later on.",29426,2
29427,"Pretty , just 2 stars because is to big",29427,2
29428,"I ordered the size recommended on the chart, but still was too small.",29428,2
29428,"I'm about 6 foot and 210lbs so I need a bigger size, I guess there isn't a size for people of my size, it's unfortunate because I like the jacket but I can't wear it.",29428,2
29429,Received it broken but I loved the style .,29429,2
29430,"The swim top looked really great in the picture, but was far too large when it arrived...it seems somewhat tapered or fit in the picture, but was rather boxy in person.",29430,2
29430,"I think if the sizing was right, it would have been a cute swimsuit.",29430,2
29430,"The top did come up as high as pictured, which was nice for me since I'm a little bigger on top and wanted a more modest alternative to most swimsuits.",29430,2
29431,The top fits like a glove.,29431,2
29431,The bottoms on the other hand are way to small.,29431,2
29431,I wouldn't recommend this.,29431,2
29431,If you do purchase it get at least two sizes larger.,29431,2
29432,This was not the product as pictured.,29432,2
29432,This product I received was a body contour dress -- tight all the way through.,29432,2
29432,The listing picture shows a looser fit through the body and hips.,29432,2
29432,Disappointed.,29432,2
29433,I don't know why this dress has so many good reviews.,29433,2
29433,I bought it because so many people liked it but I was very disappointed.,29433,2
29433,"It looks like a red tarp, not flattering at all.",29433,2
29434,Was cute way to small though,29434,2
29435,Its good for 3 dollars but my friend bought this for me thinking it was gna be similar to the alloy metal at the local himalayan store.,29435,2
29435,Theyre bracelets are strong and beautiful for a reasonable price.,29435,2
29435,But this is like a weird cheap metal that is sort of plastic coated.,29435,2
29435,It crackles when you shape it.,29435,2
29435,It is pretty but sort of costume jewelry,29435,2
29436,The picture makes it look like the end of the tail flares out and hides your feet.,29436,2
29436,"However, the velcro on the end does not stick together or keep my feet hidden.",29436,2
29436,The material is thinner than I expected and leaves dark green residue on my legs.,29436,2
29436,"Other than that, the tail was a huge hit with my friends and perfect for pool parties.",29436,2
29437,"runs really small, its is cheap looking but still wearable.",29437,2
29437,not bad for the price if could have fit in it.,29437,2
29438,Odd material-- not the best.,29438,2
29439,poor quality,29439,2
29440,I LOVE these socks ....,29440,2
29440,"BUT they wear out fast, I probably bought a dozen pair over two year period and to a one, after 6 months or so, perhaps my toes would wear through, or the heal would wear out.",29440,2
29440,It happen to all of them.,29440,2
29440,Cheaper socks last much longer.,29440,2
29440,....,29440,2
29440,These are too expensive to wear out so quickly.,29440,2
29441,"The item looks great and functions as a stretchy belt, however if you want any amount of stretch - the material that is used where the metal buckle meets the fabric doesn't respond well to anything more than about an inch of stretch.",29441,2
29441,The material on my belt started to rip and I can see with any bit of use it will break.,29441,2
29441,Order a bigger size and you'll have less issues.,29441,2
29442,Beautiful color and fabric - but runs small.,29442,2
29442,I need to return and is not available in next size up.,29442,2
29442,Disappointing.,29442,2
29443,very big,29443,2
29444,"Material is very unflattering, would order 2 sizes bigger than usual.",29444,2
29444,"(Ordered 1 size up since i am in between, fits fine, but due to material i would go baggy next time.",29444,2
29445,The shirt did not fit and it was the wrong color.,29445,2
29445,Had to settle for a $4 refund be cause it would have cost more to send it  back than it was worth.,29445,2
29446,"The collar on this shirt is huge, think butterfly collar.",29446,2
29446,"And there is a seam where the 2 patterns meet and it is not a clean transition, so the shirt looked kinda funny in that spot.",29446,2
29446,"I had high hopes for this shirt, but alas I had to return.",29446,2
29447,Sock were so warm that I couldn't wear them.,29447,2
29447,"Have used several other Incrediwear products, and this is the first to disappoint.",29447,2
29447,Also disappointing that I could not return.,29447,2
29448,Definitely for the slimmer gal.,29448,2
29448,Looks cute but I would order at least 2 sizes larger.,29448,2
29449,Loved the style n look I normally wear an XL don't like clothes tight so order XXL which turned out to be too small I was upset because I wanted to wear it because my son was taking me to DINNER FOR MY 71st BIRTHDAY,29449,2
29450,Brake really easy.,29450,2
29450,You get what you pay for.,29450,2
29451,Didn't like the quality,29451,2
29452,I guess you got what you Paid for is a very poor quality I order M and fits my 8 years old girl.,29452,2
29453,ordered a large because they said that was my size...well they werent.,29453,2
29453,go a size or two bigger.,29453,2
29453,at least my bf can wear them.,29453,2
29454,It's not snug around the rib cage.,29454,2
29454,It tents out if you have breasts.,29454,2
29455,Smaller than I thought it would be not sure it was worth the money paid,29455,2
29456,The dress fit as expected...however material is cheap.,29456,2
29456,But I guess you get what you pay for,29456,2
29457,This size is for kids very small not what i expected,29457,2
29458,"My daughter only wore once to a birthday party, and the bottoms are completely faded after the one wear.",29458,2
29458,Very disappointed.,29458,2
29459,Buttons broke before even putnitnon,29459,2
29460,button popped off as soon as she tried it on.,29460,2
29460,"ran small, just wasn't what expected.",29460,2
29460,kinda cheap looking,29460,2
29461,This swimsuit is not for girls with big boobs.,29461,2
29462,"Beautiful looking set for my wife, but they made the whole house smell horrid.",29462,2
29462,So far nothing is taking it away from them,29462,2
29463,WAY too small and I ordered a size up as recommended in reviews.,29463,2
29463,This product also had a lot of fraying and doesn't have they typical stretch you would expect from a bathing suit.,29463,2
29463,It almost feels as if it would stretch out and stay baggy over time due to the weak elastic.,29463,2
29463,"I really am only giving this 2 stars since I received the product for only $5 and I don't feel like it was that much of a loss, but had I had the opportunity to try this on in store,  I definitely wouldn't waste the money.",29463,2
29463,"The top also fit VERY small and was un-proportional to the suit, I read that many buyers switched out the top part but i wasn't able to do so with mine as it was all sown together.",29463,2
29463,I un-sewed it and replaced it with a larger top but it just didn't fit correctly and the strap that goes down the center just pulled down on my top.,29463,2
29464,Item was ok,29464,2
29465,Cheap thats I can say,29465,2
29466,"it was small, my head barely fit through the hole and there was a hole in the left pocket >:(",29466,2
29467,The material is wonderful.,29467,2
29467,The scarf is perfect.,29467,2
29467,The hat is an extremely large size.,29467,2
29467,"At this time Costumer Service has not responded, so at this point I do not know if they have a smaller size or if I should return the set.",29467,2
29467,It was a Christmas gift and too pricy for my son not to be able to use it in the cold NY Winter weather.,29467,2
29468,Seams came apart after a couple washes.,29468,2
29468,I loved them when I got them.,29468,2
29468,Just a really cheap quality,29468,2
29469,"the shipment arrived and there were no Boot tops, tiara, belt, bracelets included!",29469,2
29470,3x fits like a large.,29470,2
29471,"Right out of the package, the end of the drawstring wasn't sewn on properly and it fell off, before I'd even tried putting it on.",29471,2
29471,I will be returning for a refund.,29471,2
29472,it was very short,29472,2
29473,The wallet is nice but the picture is misleading.,29473,2
29473,I thought it was yellow with a yellow interior but it's yellow with a pink interior.,29473,2
29473,Not what I ordered!,29473,2
29473,The overall quality of it is pretty good though.,29473,2
29474,"On ""the hanger"" its beautiful, but it is a strange shaped jumper.",29474,2
29474,Although it could very well just be my body type.,29474,2
29474,"I'm 5'2"" 105lbs 34.5 hips 32A bra iMitchell looks funny, maybe I can cut the top off and make it into a cool top.",29474,2
29475,The length is not at all what the description states.,29475,2
29475,"It is only 6 inches, not 7.5.",29475,2
29475,"The zipper on top is 7.5, but that is much longer than the bag is.",29475,2
29475,"It is not big enough to put my cell phone in it, otherwise it might have been fine.",29475,2
29475,It's very tiny.,29475,2
29476,These are a poor fit.,29476,2
29476,"The waist is very tight, and the legs are so loose after a couple minutes of wear that it renders the briefs useless.",29476,2
29476,Thin material and the sizes run VERY small.,29476,2
29476,My petite 2 year old can barely squeeze into the 2-3yr size.,29476,2
29476,Wanted to love them--the price is right--but the quality/fit just isn't there.,29476,2
29477,I really liked the style of this jacket.,29477,2
29477,The description says it is a faux fur hooded jacket but the one I got had no fur in the hood.,29477,2
29477,I don't know if the description  was wrong or if they forgot the fur.,29477,2
29477,Also body of jacket is very thin.,29477,2
29477,Good for spring weather but not cold winter.,29477,2
29477,Can't figure out now why you would need a fur hood on such a thin jacket.,29477,2
29478,I've lost count of the number of dresses I've ordered and returned.,29478,2
29478,Needed a formal black dress for a gala; none are true to size.,29478,2
29478,"If they make these in Asia for Asian women and wish to sell in America, they need to correctly adjust sizing (or develop a uniform sizing standard) for American women.",29478,2
29479,"way waayyyyyyyy too small,",29479,2
29480,while i like the fit and am happy with that aspect of things i am also disappointed with other things.,29480,2
29480,the corset is advertised as having 26 steel bones.,29480,2
29480,it does NOT have 26 it has 20 or 22 at most.,29480,2
29480,also the steel bones aren't paticularly strong.,29480,2
29480,for something advertised as double steel boned it shouldnt be so flexible.,29480,2
29480,one last thing is it says long cut corset but it has same from busk measurement as the same brand corset that is advertised as having 24 bones but not a long cut.,29480,2
29480,i think the sizing is true but not the other advertised aspects so unfortunately i will be returning it.,29480,2
29481,"I'm 6'4"" tall the jacket is a little short in my opinion.",29481,2
29481,It has a nice look but the sales price is the only saving grace.,29481,2
29481,For the whole sale listed price I was expecting a nicer lining and better stitching and pockets overall.,29481,2
29482,"I wear a 2x, but got the 3x it was a little snug.",29482,2
29482,The dress is beautiful,29482,2
29483,beautiful color and dress but it was way too big,29483,2
29484,Very cute but broke after a few wears.,29484,2
29484,:(,29484,2
29485,I went by the fitting chart which was wrong it's to big.,29485,2
29486,Loose fitted.,29486,2
29486,Not what I expected.,29486,2
29487,I don't like the fabric,29487,2
29488,I didn't realize this was a set with only one of each size taper.,29488,2
29488,I should have read the description better but I've never even seen a tape set with a single for each size so I didn't think to check?,29488,2
29489,I originally ordered a different dress and how to return it it was a 4Tunfortunately it was way too small and look like 12 months so I ordered a totally different dress 5T different fit hopefully and it barely fit her it's a little bit short and a little snug so I know in the future if I ever order from the same company I would have to definitely order at least three sizes bigger,29489,2
29490,"I bought two of these, one in purple size XXL,  and one for my 12 year old daughter size L. I normally wear an xl and she wears a sm/m but I ordered up in sizes.",29490,2
29490,So glad I did because the XXL is exactly the same size as the large.,29490,2
29490,Thank goodness they are both small enough to fit her so we will keep them even though they weren't what we originally thought we were getting.,29490,2
29490,"Also,  it needs to be noted that the purple hoodie is a much thicker material than the khaki version.",29490,2
29490,No idea why.,29490,2
29490,"My daughter has not worn them other than to try them on but the quality,  at least,  seems nice.",29490,2
29491,Very large,29491,2
29492,You get what you pay for.,29492,2
29492,It twists up super fast - hard to detangle.,29492,2
29492,I set it on the sink the DAY AFTER I bought it and a drop of water caused it to rust and stain my basin and the necklace.,29492,2
29492,Threw it right in the trash.,29492,2
29493,"First off, this is not made by H2H.",29493,2
29493,It is made by a company called Everlis.,29493,2
29493,"Second, this is not a fitted shirt.",29493,2
29493,It is a flat traditional fit that is baggy around the waist if your are of normal proportions.,29493,2
29493,Very unfortunate that the descriptions are lies.,29493,2
29493,"The color is great, but that does not make up for its deficiencies.",29493,2
29494,VERY difficult to click together!,29494,2
29495,Sleeves ripped.,29495,2
29495,Barely closes.,29495,2
29495,Some metal pole keeps sliding out and sticking me.,29495,2
29496,"Sorry, had to return - I thought I had a normal size head, but this fit way too big - not flattering (had to return).",29496,2
29496,Sorry.,29496,2
29497,"Very thin, T-shirt material.",29497,2
29497,Had it only a day and the pocket has started coming undone.,29497,2
29498,One of the inside zippers broke the 3rd day I had the bag.,29498,2
29498,The shoulder strap is too easily detachable from the bag as it comes off repeatedly.,29498,2
29499,For a Tony Lama brand I expected better quality.,29499,2
29499,Lots of scratches on the leather.,29499,2
29499,The corner seems were not stitched  correctly.,29499,2
29499,Looks like something you would Pick Up a flea market.,29499,2
29499,Very disappointing.,29499,2
29500,"I taught it was cotton, i found out it's silk shirt.",29500,2
29501,Shrinks majorly in wash,29501,2
29502,"these are pretty, but the posts are too thick to go through my ear.",29502,2
29502,I was ill and couldn't return them in time and now I am sad.,29502,2
29503,"Good watch band for the value, but quality is lacking.",29503,2
29503,There are two bands which you tuck the strap under after you put the buckle in place.,29503,2
29503,One of the two just completely snapped off on the second day of use (about 3 cycles of on and off).,29503,2
29503,"It seems like the other one may go soon, too.",29503,2
29503,"Probably would go for a higher quality one next time, something that will hold up for more than a day.",29503,2
29504,"Ordered a size larger than usual but was still way to small
Dress was beautiful very disappointed it didn't fit",29504,2
29505,The material on this though is soft cotton but obvious cheap quality.,29505,2
29505,You get what you pay for in this instance.,29505,2
29505,The fit was ok and ft as expected.,29505,2
29505,"I got the white and it was a bit see through, it would probably be best to get in a darker color.",29505,2
29506,way too small nothing like the picture cheap too if anything look for something better not true to size fit a 10 yr old  gave it away,29506,2
29507,The liner inside was WAY shorter than the dress.,29507,2
29508,I don't like it.,29508,2
29508,There are weird boning features in the front that show in light material-ed dresses and tops.,29508,2
29508,"Had I know that before purchasing it, I would not have (granted maybe others can see it in the picture and I just didn't) but still nah brah.",29508,2
29508,"I also have a nice butt, I feel, and I don't feel like this did too much for me in the butt department, not enough to warrant to wear this uncomfortable bone in girdle get up.",29508,2
29509,Very see through.. and I am not overweight.,29509,2
29510,Arms were too tight.,29510,2
29511,The metal ended up oxidizing with my finger and it turned green and black.,29511,2
29511,So sad because it really meant so much to me,29511,2
29512,Zipper came unattached on one side.,29512,2
29512,IT'S A GORGEOUS DRESS.,29512,2
29512,But i have to take it to a seamstress,29512,2
29513,It was not what I expected.,29513,2
29514,"Cheap fabric, too big on top, too short on the bottom.",29514,2
29514,Very awkward for short torsos!,29514,2
29515,These mittens are so narrow it's nearly impossible to shove a 2 year olds hands into them!,29515,2
29515,They are warm mittens but they fall off so easily because the opening is so small the hands don't stay inside.,29515,2
29515,Disappointed for sure.,29515,2
29515,"My toddler prefers the cheap cotton mittens, I just put two pairs on for the cold days.",29515,2
29516,"Item to small, returning",29516,2
29517,The top of this shirt is way too baggy.,29517,2
29517,I will be returning it,29517,2
29518,"Terrible, the size way off I'm size 12 and typically get a large with no issues.",29518,2
29518,To say this fit like a glove is exactly what I received.,29518,2
29518,I gave it to my 11 year old daughter.,29518,2
29518,I would not recommend to anyone very disappointing.,29518,2
29519,It's not actually white as advertised.,29519,2
29519,It's cream with white trim.,29519,2
29519,Not what I was looking for.,29519,2
29520,The LED light didn't work :( ...,29520,2
29520,It was disappointing.,29520,2
29520,External status OK,29520,2
29521,Small on bottom.,29521,2
29521,Big on top.,29521,2
29521,Overall fit wasn't great wish I could return,29521,2
29522,Does not fit correctly!,29522,2
29522,The top is too big and the bottom is too small!,29522,2
29522,I attempted to request a refund but it's impossible.,29522,2
29522,Please don't order this if you want to do yourself a favor.,29522,2
29522,"Also, the return shipping costs more than the swimsuit itself.",29522,2
29522,Not worth the buy.,29522,2
29523,"This is just normal swimsuit fabric, of low quality with a scratchy lining.",29523,2
29523,I didn't bother to try it on as I was looking for actual thick scuba-type fabric.,29523,2
29524,"Got like 3 sizes bigger than what I am, still too small.",29524,2
29525,Cute but they fell apart the first day,29525,2
29526,Runs very small.,29526,2
29527,the size didn't fit well,29527,2
29528,ordered the wrong size,29528,2
29529,"I returned this product since the sizing was off (shoulders too narrow but otherwise bulky), the quality of material was poor (strange lace, uneven stitching), and the smell was funky.",29529,2
29530,Would be cute if the top wasn't so big and the skirt didn't flare out in a weird way.,29530,2
29530,Had to do major modifications to make the top fit.,29530,2
29530,I have average size boobs so it is always a disappointment when I buy these things and they are for size DDD or something.,29530,2
29530,Girls don't have to have giant boobs to be sexy...,29530,2
29531,"mother likes it, but threads come out when washed, had to be re-sown around the belt and sleeves..",29531,2
29532,The sleeves were too tight and could not be worn.,29532,2
29532,"Although the seller offers to refund the full purchase price, once you calculate the out-of-pocket cost to return to China, it makes no sense since the shipping charges are as much as the jacket itself!",29532,2
29532,"If you buy this jacket, hope that it fits because sending it back really doesn't make financial sense.",29532,2
29532,I do not recommend purchasing unless your arms are thin!,29532,2
29533,Too small and legs open too big,29533,2
29534,"Quality is fine, but the xl fit like a shirt.",29534,2
29534,I normally wear a medium.,29534,2
29534,"Not a dress unless your a small, petite girl.",29534,2
29535,"I loved these when I first received them because they were really long, and I'm fairly tall and have long legs.",29535,2
29535,"After one wash, they shrunk substantially and now I'll never wear them again.",29535,2
29535,Pretty disappointed.,29535,2
29536,More like a shirt than a dress.,29536,2
29536,Waistband was very very tight and I could not even get my arms through without it ripping a bit.,29536,2
29536,Looks like a sheet when wearing it.,29536,2
29536,"There are a lot of other nicer dresses out there with better looks, so skip this one.",29536,2
29537,Minute numbers are worn off after 1 day of wearing it.,29537,2
29537,Band it too hard for kids to take on and off easily---would prefer velcro.,29537,2
29537,Bought my older son a timex and it's been great for 2 years!,29537,2
29537,Won't make the mistake of buying something other than Timex again.,29537,2
29538,The fabric is rather irritating and doesn't fall very prettily.,29538,2
29539,too long,29539,2
29540,I wanted to love this.,29540,2
29540,The sliver plating wore off--easily.,29540,2
29540,The flowers are weak and bent backwards ..,29540,2
29540,"Hence, dropping the stone.",29540,2
29540,"The stone, itself is beautiful.",29540,2
29540,"I'm really only giving a 2star for the quality of the stone, and the prettiness of the design.",29540,2
29540,Which doesn't account for much considering the cheapness of everything else.,29540,2
29541,They are not as pictured at all.,29541,2
29541,They are VERY DARK blue.,29541,2
29541,We wanted light blue lenses.,29541,2
29541,These are not light blue.,29541,2
29541,They're navy.,29541,2
29542,Super price but the quality shows.,29542,2
29542,It arrived with a tear in the mid area.,29542,2
29542,It arrived just before we were leaving for disney world so I did not have time to return it and needed the hoop slip immediately.,29542,2
29542,I was able to repair it but most likely would not purchase it again at this store.,29542,2
29543,"After waiting a whole month to receive this dress, we get it and my daughter tries it on and we immediately notice that it looks nothing like the picture.",29543,2
29543,"The high part in the front is poorly sewn, esp the slip that is attached to the dress.",29543,2
29543,Some of the beading was already broken so we will have to repair it.,29543,2
29543,the top of the dress fits snuggly except for the breast area with the padding; this area sags from the extra padding so we have to add straps so that it will stay up.,29543,2
29543,I am disappointed in this and when I contacted the seller I was basically told to stay calm and have not received a response back since I asked for a return,29543,2
29544,Cheaply made and looks better on the picture.,29544,2
29545,It works but starts to diginto my head,29545,2
29546,too big,29546,2
29547,T-shirt dress with awkward unnecessary side zipper that protrudes out of dress at hip.,29547,2
29547,"Normally wear 7/8, purchased medium it was a little to large.",29547,2
29547,5' and the dress was below the knee.,29547,2
29548,"Made for a kid, not an adult.",29548,2
29548,Don't waste your money.,29548,2
29549,Beautiful patter and color.,29549,2
29549,"However, I am returning the dress it us very snug around the belly.",29549,2
29549,Not a loose fit.,29549,2
29550,Fits cute but all the cheap buttons popped off.,29550,2
29550,I sewed it together eventually,29550,2
29551,Beautiful colors and material is nice but way too small.,29551,2
29552,"So short, and the bottom is very see-through.",29552,2
29552,The slip stops at an awkward length and then you just have like 2 feet of transparent fabric.,29552,2
29552,Don't recommend.,29552,2
29552,Also they don't do free returns.,29552,2
29553,My ornament was loose inside the box and it had a scratch on it.,29553,2
29553,Kind of disappointed.,29553,2
29554,This material is really think.,29554,2
29554,The straps don't stay on.,29554,2
29554,However I got half my money back and just wear it around the house.,29554,2
29555,Very cheap construction.,29555,2
29555,the nose on the right half collapses in and blocks the already minuscule eye holes.,29555,2
29555,The paint on the mask is pretty poor too.,29555,2
29556,It is not exactly  as it  shown at the picture,29556,2
29557,"The quality of this product was absolutely pathetic, especially considering the price.",29557,2
29557,"It was squished inside of a plastic bag, and I'm so glad I removed it from the packaging before gifting it for Christmas.",29557,2
29557,"It was covered in fuzz, lint, and strings of thread.",29557,2
29557,"I spent a good amount of time picking each off of the onesie, then cutting off all of the threads that were sticking out from various seams on the pajamas.",29557,2
29557,"I ordered a size large, and it is barely long enough to touch the ankles of my friend who is 5'2"".",29557,2
29557,"For nearly $30, this was extremely poor quality and I would not recommend that others purchase this product.",29557,2
29558,"poorly constructed, one of them fell apart out of the box.",29558,2
29559,Nice bracelet but extremely stiff.,29559,2
29560,Really tight & see through.,29560,2
29561,The material sucks and it is not by any means a slim fit.,29561,2
29561,"Also, the logo on the back is way smaller than in the image.",29561,2
29562,I like the Jacket it just runs to small in size,29562,2
29563,This is NOT a dress!,29563,2
29563,It's a bathing suit cover or shirt!,29563,2
29563,I ordered thinking it would be a nice spring dress and am a lil disappointed!,29563,2
29563,If you add a second slip and don't care that it's not the right color it can be a dress.,29563,2
29563,"I'm 5.2"" and 140lb and 15 weeks pregnant and it's just a glorified swimsuit cover unfortunately in the 5 pictures I added you can see just how short the real slip is.",29563,2
29563,I can't bend over!,29563,2
29563,Then I added the white slip and it's still not as long at the top layer of the dress.,29563,2
29563,I thought by adding the white it would help.,29563,2
29563,But idk about this.,29563,2
29563,Also it's baggy in the top.,29563,2
29563,The color is neon coral !,29563,2
29563,!,29563,2
29564,Quality was not as good as expected.,29564,2
29564,Also did not fit my husband (larger dude).,29564,2
29565,"nice concept but hem in color of bodice was torn, the sleeve was partially discolored.",29565,2
29565,2 stars cause it is true to size.,29565,2
29565,Returning.,29565,2
29566,"The XXL fits like a Large, such I nice top",29566,2
29567,Shorts were too short.,29567,2
29567,The item didn't look quite like it was pictured.,29567,2
29567,It looked like a night gown.,29567,2
29568,Before I would rate this I had to check if I missed if there were a choice of sizes.,29568,2
29568,There is not.,29568,2
29569,Way too big,29569,2
29570,cheap fabric,29570,2
29571,"Mt daughter specifically bought the bag for the design, but it is NOT pictured as shown.",29571,2
29571,Very disappointed.,29571,2
29571,Not to mention it's not good for normal sized laptops.,29571,2
29571,But the design is the major bummer.,29571,2
29571,I gave it 2 stars because the fabric seems sturdy and there is a variety of pockets.,29571,2
29572,These pieces are very beautiful but the quality is very poor.,29572,2
29572,This is the first time I broke out around the neck area wearing 4 out of 5 pieces of jewelry.,29572,2
29572,The chain is very badly coated.,29572,2
29573,Cute but much smaller than pictured.,29573,2
29573,Snug on my daughter.,29573,2
29573,No room around her face like in the picture.,29573,2
29573,Wish I had seen review about pattern being potentially stolen before I ordered.,29573,2
29574,It was way to tiny.,29574,2
29574,I had to return it.,29574,2
29574,It's about as big as the picture.,29574,2
29575,Not worm for head.,29575,2
29576,Have a pair bought from the store that aren't a bit big.,29576,2
29576,( slips off my hips without unbuttoning) so I ordered.,29576,2
29576,A size smaller.,29576,2
29576,Same outcome!,29576,2
29577,I had this shark belly button ring for less than a month and it's already changing color.,29577,2
29577,I have not  been to the beach nor the pool so it's not the sea water nor the chlorine.,29577,2
29577,Total disappointment.,29577,2
29578,"The body firs perfectly, a little big in the boobs.",29578,2
29578,Also it does not have a undercup liner to hold the girls in.,29578,2
29578,I wish it did.,29578,2
29579,Fits really odd.,29579,2
29580,pros: fast shipping from china.,29580,2
29580,excellent communication and customer service from the seller!,29580,2
29580,"cons: the sizing is ok, though do know the skirt is very short.",29580,2
29580,the real concern with this kimono is the actual design.,29580,2
29580,the shoulder holes are way too far down the arm.,29580,2
29580,"they are more like mid to upper arm holes instead, so it looks very awkward when wearing.",29580,2
29580,"i am 5'2"" and about 135lbs.",29580,2
29580,"perhaps the hole placement would be better on a taller person, however due to the length of the skirt part, it would have to act more as a top only for tall people.",29580,2
29580,"the fabric is thin and cool, with not much stretch.",29580,2
29580,i requested a return for two reasons: 1. the shoulder hole placement 2. the wrong fabric pattern was sent.,29580,2
29580,"i requested the purple one shown, but was sent another purple pattern that was not cute.",29580,2
29581,This was not as appealing as it looks online!,29581,2
29581,I would not recommend,29581,2
29582,Although the product looks fantastic it's a shame because the adhesive used can't hold them on from the slightest nudge of my finger let alone wind resistance.,29582,2
29582,Even after cleaning throughly and using an alcohol prep pad the product still won't stick.,29582,2
29583,"I'm in a business ambient where I'm usually the only woman in the board room, so I have fun being unique.",29583,2
29583,"This shirt had potential for formal and informal situations, so I gave it a go.",29583,2
29583,"When it arrived, the material was much cheaper than anticipated (especially for the pricing), the sizing was off, and - as other reviewers have also pointed out and I wrongly ignored - there indeed is a highly noticeable stitching line front and center.",29583,2
29583,"The only positives I can mention for the product is that it isn't see through, it arrived on time, and it was not itchy.",29583,2
29583,"If you can deal with poor stitching but an otherwise stylish shirt, your call.",29583,2
29584,No recomendada,29584,2
29585,"Great look, but it is very short on the Torso and Arms.",29585,2
29586,"My girl is 5'2"" 120 pounds.",29586,2
29586,She couldn't get are hips around them,29586,2
29587,Took a while to arrive but when it got home I was happy with it until I wash it... lasted only one wash bottom was falling apart....,29587,2
29588,Loose there shine quick but other then that ok,29588,2
29589,I kept it because I didn't want to pay to ship it back.,29589,2
29589,"However, I do not wear this shirt.",29589,2
29589,I am a size 16/18 and ordered the biggest size available.,29589,2
29589,"Uh, yeah, big nope!",29589,2
29589,"My mom, a size 8/10 wears this short now.",29589,2
29589,I really wish the sizing had worked out because I love the print!,29589,2
29590,"Bigger then I expected, I wear a medium and that's the size that I got and it looks like it would fit someone that would wear an XL",29590,2
29591,Seemed like a great idea - turns out it's not!,29591,2
29591,It was worth a shot for 5 bucks.,29591,2
29591,Got the blue bird design.,29591,2
29591,Ripped within the first minute of wearing it.,29591,2
29591,"I wish I was joking, lol.",29591,2
29591,Love how it looks except for the ugly light yellow pee coloration... so the birds are cool.,29591,2
29591,That's about it!,29591,2
29591,Can't speak for the other designs but this tank just bums me out - you could say I'm a little blue with a hint of pee yellow.,29591,2
29592,"Bought this as my husband's wedding band, was too big.",29592,2
29592,"Though I ordered a size 9, I took it to a jeweler and it was sized at 9 3/4.",29592,2
29592,Not true to size.,29592,2
29593,The coat is cute but the size is completely wrong I ordered a 2x which is 2 times my size and it was still too small.,29593,2
29594,I purchase size Large and received small size WHICH MAKES IT too tight of fit.,29594,2
29595,in the picture they look great.,29595,2
29595,bought what should have been the right size but was too small.,29595,2
29595,had to return,29595,2
29596,This dress looks so pretty but I thought the fit was odd.,29596,2
29596,It fit but looked small because it clings.,29596,2
29596,It doesn't have a liner so it would be very hard to wear due to the see-thru factor.,29596,2
29596,I really wanted this dress to work for me but it just didn't.,29596,2
29596,Had to return it.,29596,2
29597,Item shorter than expected.,29597,2
29597,Not as shown in photo.,29597,2
29598,The material is very thin and cheap feeling.,29598,2
29598,"The hem is very loose, and the wing on the shoulder is more like a super hero cape!",29598,2
29598,Not in a good way!,29598,2
29599,The ring itself is pretty.,29599,2
29599,When I received it there was a small flaw.,29599,2
29599,Wore it one time and multiple stones fell out.,29599,2
29599,"While I realize it's a cheap price, I didn't expect such poor quality and to loose stones that quickly.",29599,2
29599,Wouldn't recommend.,29599,2
29600,i love the idea of this dress and was so happy to find it on amazon at such a great price!,29600,2
29600,the quality of the material and the workmanship was excellent.,29600,2
29600,"my issue is the bust was flat, too large, and the waist too puffy.",29600,2
29600,"had the fit been better, i'd have rocked this all summer.",29600,2
29601,"Wear a 2xx shirt, this hang ten shirt was like xl shirt kind of disappointed because I grew up with hang ten shirts.",29601,2
29602,I bought this for my bachelorette party and it looked great with my dress!,29602,2
29602,"Unfortunately, the strap broke later in the night.",29602,2
29602,I only got to use it once and probably won't bother with it again.,29602,2
29603,This dress was meant to be my disabled daughter's prom dress.,29603,2
29603,She was so excited to receive it.,29603,2
29603,Unfortunately it didn't fit at all.,29603,2
29603,It's WAY smaller than I expected.,29603,2
29603,The zipper is impossible!!,29603,2
29603,I broke two nails just trying to unzip it.,29603,2
29603,The stitching was sloppy.,29603,2
29603,The flower strap was cute but the flowers were attached loosely and just kind of hung there.,29603,2
29603,I'm returning this dress and have already purchased a different one.,29603,2
29603,Thank goodness for prime and two day shipping!!,29603,2
29603,I have 2 stars rather than 1 because the dress is cute just not made well.,29603,2
29603,Plus I knew for the price what to expect.,29603,2
29603,I just wish it wouldn't fit her.,29603,2
29603,I mean they're was no way to even do alterations to make it fit.,29603,2
29603,It's a pretty dress but really needs some improvements in construction.,29603,2
29604,Te size like for kids.,29604,2
29605,Two days with her and goes from gold to silver.,29605,2
29605,A theft.,29605,2
29605,: '(,29605,2
29606,"Nice shirt and very soft but even ordering a size up, the fit was really tight.",29606,2
29607,"Decent idea, BUT
Well it didn't fit bad, because the leg straps are soft and have no elastic in them they are loose!",29607,2
29607,"And unfortunately as much as I was hoping I would love them, I have a tough time dealing with the mesh fabric.",29607,2
29607,"It's too rough, I was hoping it would have been more of a mesh type feel, it needs to be smoother and softer on your piece!",29607,2
29607,It's almost like having chicken wire smashed into your junk!,29607,2
29607,Not  nicey nice!,29607,2
29607,"Some may like, but not my taste, I like stuff like that to be soft and smooth, even when my girl rubs it, she said it wasn't the best feeling on her hand non the less!",29607,2
29607,Finger nails getting caught in/on the little screen squares!!,29607,2
29607,Would recommend you look for something nicer!,29607,2
29607,Sorry for the negative review but I've never been a bullsh!++?,29607,2
29608,Chest area too tight.,29608,2
29608,"Pants length extremely long, and would need to be hemmed unless you are a supermodel with long legs.",29608,2
29608,"Belt was too shot, basically useless.",29608,2
29609,"These pants look great in the photos, but you can tell the manufacturing is crap.",29609,2
29609,"The proportions are off, the legs are too short (I'm 5'5"" and these are like high waters on me) plus when I squat down the back shows my underwear.",29609,2
29609,The ankles are loose even though the calves are tight and it looks embarrassing.,29609,2
29609,The only way I can use these now is to wear knee-length socks over the mess at the bottom and make sure to wear a sweater or a long enough shirt over the top.,29609,2
29609,"I get most of my workout pants from Target and they are way better than this, I wouldn't buy this product again.",29609,2
29609,I will probably wind up donating this pair after wearing 2-3 more times which is a waste of my money.,29609,2
29610,"I though the lettering would be pink, but it was white :(",29610,2
29611,Strange shirt,29611,2
29612,I wanted to give these shoes 5 stars but and only giving them 2 stars.,29612,2
29612,"Purchased shoes and they were delivered June 20, 2016.",29612,2
29612,"As with the other pairs of Vionic I own, fit & comfort are awesome but the quality of this pair has left me a bit bummed out.",29612,2
29612,I wore these maybe 8-10 times over the 2 months I have had them and noticed today the heal strap is tearing in a place that won't allow for repair.,29612,2
29612,Disappointed in this pair and now I'm out good money.,29612,2
29612,Just my honest opinion but the company should stand by their product for more than 30days.,29612,2
29613,made very cheaply will never buy again,29613,2
29614,I was really excited to receive this set.,29614,2
29614,I thought since it's not the cheapest I was making a good decision.,29614,2
29614,"I don't like the screw-on tunnels but it's unfair to mark that against the product, as this was experimental for me...",29614,2
29614,I understand that comes down to preference.,29614,2
29614,"The issue was that, in addition to these being abrasive, if not  more aptly described as sharp-edged, the black pair was broken and could have cut me pretty badly if I hadn't noticed before trying to put it in.",29614,2
29614,Alas it is not worth returning but buyer beware!,29614,2
29614,I gave it 2 stars because they are attractive.,29614,2
29615,"Does not fit, I ordered a 16 and it is more like size 12.",29615,2
29616,BAD QUALITY.,29616,2
29616,TERRIBLE QUALITY,29616,2
29617,Very upset I ordered these for my birthday but they were TOO SMALL I'm very upset.,29617,2
29617,The fit a whole size too small,29617,2
29618,"Good for the price I guess, but definitely looks very cheap.",29618,2
29618,I haven't worn it yet and I don't know if I ever will....,29618,2
29619,The Sandal was designed so poorly that I could not slide my foot and deep enough to where it wasn't hanging 6 inches off the back.,29619,2
29619,The T strap did not allow for an arch on the top of your foot therefore not letting your foot completely go into the shoe.,29619,2
29619,Very disappointed since I love the color and the design,29619,2
29620,The item is not what I was expecting at all.,29620,2
29620,The material did not have a leather-like smell and smelled like something had burned it.,29620,2
29620,The material felt more like a cheap Halloween costume and felt more like paper.,29620,2
29621,Dissapointed with the pearl being flat on one side.,29621,2
29621,Otherwise OK for the price.,29621,2
29621,I returned it.,29621,2
29622,When it said sheer....,29622,2
29622,I figured nude with sheer lace over top so you could actually wear it to the beach.,29622,2
29622,This you need to put something under it in order to wear.,29622,2
29622,Would've been a cute suit though.,29622,2
29623,these are great if you have no rear end.,29623,2
29624,I wear a size 11 1/2 shoe.,29624,2
29624,These socks are too small.,29624,2
29625,The dress was way too big.,29625,2
29625,The material was cheap and see through,29625,2
29626,The tights did not have enough Lacra.,29626,2
29626,They were baggy.,29626,2
29626,The elastic waist band was not comfortable.,29626,2
29626,I returned this item.,29626,2
29627,Okay.,29627,2
29627,"First off, the material is very strange and the white dress is not a white but is more of a dingy yellow white.",29627,2
29627,It reminds me of what white clothes/etc look like after being exposed to cigarette smoke for a long time.,29627,2
29627,"Next, I am 5'3 and about 135 lbs.",29627,2
29627,I ordered the medium.,29627,2
29627,It fits okay but the length is way to long.,29627,2
29627,This dress went almost to my knees.,29627,2
29627,It is not flattering at all.,29627,2
29627,I am hoping that I can alter it to a decent length.,29627,2
29627,Would be a cute dress if it was shorter and the correct color.,29627,2
29628,It ripped on the first time she wore them /(,29628,2
29629,The design is not even close to what is pictured.,29629,2
29629,"It's really a sweater, it's more of a shirt-like material.",29629,2
29629,I ordered an x-small and got a small and its big for a small.,29629,2
29630,Way to big around,29630,2
29631,They are cute and stay on better than elastic ones but the velcro scratched my babies face and nose!,29631,2
29632,The top part of this is very cute.,29632,2
29632,I liked it a lot.,29632,2
29632,"Unfortunately, the crotchless panties are merely panties that someone took a knife or scissors yo cut a hole in.",29632,2
29632,For the price I paid I can't complain very much because I at least got the cute babydoll top out of it.,29632,2
29633,It fit a little smaller then the other large's that I normally wear in sweats.,29633,2
29633,Don't know if its this pair or the way there are made.,29633,2
29633,Probably will not order again.,29633,2
29634,"Too long, the waist is too large and the material is not very nice.",29634,2
29634,There is a funny flap in the pocket that I don't like either.,29634,2
29634,They just look a little silly.,29634,2
29634,I feel like I look like a middle schooler wearing them.,29634,2
29634,That is probably the last thing in the world I want to feel like.,29634,2
29635,This looks like a very comfortable shirt and I was planning on using this for a bathing suit cover up and lounge around wear.,29635,2
29635,I was not impresses with the material it was scratchy and thick.,29635,2
29635,The neck of the shirt had very heavy duty elastic and squeezed me too tight.,29635,2
29635,The armholes were too small (given I have very large arms).,29635,2
29635,I just did not see myself ever feeling comfortable in this shirt.,29635,2
29635,It is going back.,29635,2
29636,Very poor stich quality.. Material texture is fine.,29636,2
29637,"This was a cute shirt, but the proportions are WAY off!",29637,2
29637,"The bottom fit like a ladies XL, and was a tad bit short, but the top fit like a ladies medium.",29637,2
29637,"If you wear bigger than a b cup bra, good luck wearing this one.",29637,2
29638,"I followed the chart, and ordered accordingly.",29638,2
29638,It's saggy.,29638,2
29638,"As you wear it, and the day goes on, it loses its shape even more and by the end of the day you have to cut the sleeves because they've grown past your fingertips",29638,2
29639,Pretty uncomfortable and wore holes in the heel after less than 3 months.,29639,2
29639,Do not recommend.,29639,2
29640,"These are pretty for the money, but won't stay in place as shown.",29640,2
29641,That is not a size 8 ring.,29641,2
29641,Ring is nice overall...but..not worth $30.,29641,2
29641,"If it was a size 8...maybe...
A true Queen Galadriel make ring cost about $150.",29641,2
29641,And I am sure...if ask for a size 8...you will get a size 8.,29641,2
29641,You get what you payfor....kinda sad.,29641,2
29642,The material is thin and somewhat see through.,29642,2
29642,Dress was constructed okay but I had to trim a lot of loose threads.,29642,2
29642,Had I seen it being sold like that in a store I would not have looked at it twice.,29642,2
29642,I wore it twice and washed and dried it in the dryer and the material held up well surprisingly.,29642,2
29642,I have mixed feelings towards this dress.,29642,2
29643,Said to fix the iPhone SE but was too long.,29643,2
29643,Had to order a replacement,29643,2
29644,It does the job but it's uncomfortable in a back pocket.,29644,2
29644,"Also, the photo indicated there is adequate room for a dollar bill which is true but not multiple bills since they must be folded.",29644,2
29644,This case is more for a lady which she can carry in her purse.,29644,2
29645,"Beautiful, but way too small.",29645,2
29646,The picture and description are not representative of the actual product.,29646,2
29646,This ring is VERY thin and tiny!!,29646,2
29646,"I bought a 6 strand puzzle ring to avoid getting a whimpy, thin ring...but a thin whimpy ring is exactly what arrived!!",29646,2
29646,Very disappointed!,29646,2
29647,Ordered an XXL and it was comparable to a junior size 8 or medium!,29647,2
29647,"It was so cute, wish it would've fit me!",29647,2
29648,It's very cheap quality.,29648,2
29649,When the bracelet arrived it was just like it was described.,29649,2
29649,"After a few weeks, the gold started to fade.",29649,2
29649,I wouldn't recommend purchasing this bracelet.,29649,2
29650,This was shorter in front than the back.,29650,2
29650,I am not even 5ft tall and it was to short for me.,29650,2
29650,Also to tight in the chest.,29650,2
29650,Material was good.,29650,2
29650,Wish it was longer.,29650,2
29651,"Super cute suit but be prepared to purchase 2-3 time larger than you normally wear, if you want to wear it in public.",29651,2
29651,"The quality was great and the look adorable, but I bought a Large and then purchased a second one in XLarge but it still doesn't fit.",29651,2
29651,"I'm a rather tall and thin, 5'11"" 135lb woman that normally wears a size Medium.",29651,2
29651,Neither top fit me at all but the XL bottoms fit just well enough for me to wear while laying out in the sun in my back yard.,29651,2
29651,But it's too small to wear in public!,29651,2
29651,I ended up giving the suit to a family friend teenager and it fit her great.,29651,2
29652,This shirt arrived within the estimated delivery date.,29652,2
29652,"While the pattern is similar to what is pictured,  it is definitely not the same shirt.",29652,2
29652,"It is more of a  spandex instead of cotton, so it's clingy/stretchy instead of loose and comfy like the picture and description claim.",29652,2
29652,"I'm pretty disappointed in the material and fit,  but only bc I was expecting something so different.",29652,2
29652,Otherwise it is ok.,29652,2
29653,This has ended up being a dress I only wear at home.,29653,2
29653,"If you get any water or liquid on the dress, not only does the fabric pucker, but it also looks stained.",29653,2
29653,"Since water drops gives it a stained appearance, you can't spot clean any spills.",29653,2
29653,"With a toddler and 3 week old, I have yet to wear something that hasn't suffered a spill!",29653,2
29653,The only way to get rid of the water/liquid stains is by washing the dress.,29653,2
29653,The fabric also gets very stretched after pulling aside to nurse.,29653,2
29653,"All in all, a cheaply made, not very useful dress, unless you aren't going anywhere and don't much care what you look like!",29653,2
29653,The other Happy Mama dress I ordered from Amazon has exactly the same problems.,29653,2
29654,Disappointed.,29654,2
29654,Nice quality sweatshirt and fit as expected but The print is muted.,29654,2
29654,Not nearly as colorful as shown.,29654,2
29654,I'll probably donate to Goodwill.,29654,2
29655,"The dress looked like the pic., But, it was way to small!",29655,2
29655,I ordered a large which was the largest size they have.,29655,2
29655,I wear medium in America sizes.,29655,2
29655,"Well, the dress came and I tried it on and I could even zip the zipper.",29655,2
29655,It was way to little.,29655,2
29655,I gave the dress to my daughter she wears a small (in America).,29655,2
29655,It fits her better.,29655,2
29656,"Stylish sunglasses, but plated with cheap metal, it gives me pimples on both side of my nose, it was not acceptable!",29656,2
29656,"If you have sensitive skin, please do not take the risk!!!",29656,2
29656,!,29656,2
29657,"It fit as expected but it does run smal ,it is made for petite body types the color was nothing like I expected and pictured in the image..I wanted beige but it is more like a pumpkin color.",29657,2
29657,"I think the color isn't so ugly but with my skin tone it doesn't look good,would look nicer and darker skin",29657,2
29658,"They're very cute and good quality, but they are not 20g as advertised.",29658,2
29658,"They are 22g, much thinner than a 20g nose screw.",29658,2
29658,"For that, I give them 2 stars, they should advertise them correctly.",29658,2
29659,I ordered a large knowing this dress was made overseas.,29659,2
29659,I usually wear a medium comfortably.,29659,2
29659,"Unfortunately, even the large was way too tight through the shoulders and into the arms.",29659,2
29659,"I'm 5'9"" and it was definitely not fitted to taller females.",29659,2
29659,I will be returning this item.,29659,2
29660,Got blouse at a pretty good price but it had two severe snags in it.,29660,2
29660,HATE returning things.,29660,2
29660,I can mend so I decided to keep it in stead of return,29660,2
29661,"Very unattractive Returning
Appears to be good quality",29661,2
29662,Like 10 so far are defective.,29662,2
29662,Swallowed 3,29662,2
29663,Being a Patagonia hat I bought it for outdoor use.,29663,2
29663,When I first got the hat it looked and felt great.,29663,2
29663,The color was a beautiful dark blue.,29663,2
29663,I took it with me to South America and only after a week in the desert the color faded and it started to look washed out.,29663,2
29663,The hat looks ten years old now.,29663,2
29663,"It's probably okay for casual use, but it's definitely not good for extended outdoor use.",29663,2
29664,I purchased in three colors.,29664,2
29664,Way too small and I usually wear a small.,29664,2
29664,Fabric is very thin.,29664,2
29664,"Buttons are those snap kind, and tore the fabric.",29664,2
29664,"Also the buttons are not actually buttons, but some cheap looking plastic crystals.",29664,2
29664,So I Can't even sew on real buttons.,29664,2
29664,"In all honesty, I feel this shirt is over priced.",29664,2
29665,Very inferior quality.,29665,2
29665,Loose threads all over the jacket.,29665,2
29666,I've had it about two weeks now and it was good till the little rods poked me on my back don't buy,29666,2
29667,Fits like an extra large,29667,2
29668,The sleeves are clearly to short.,29668,2
29668,Nice green I was disapointed.,29668,2
29669,Order came in as a small.,29669,2
29669,I asked for a 3x.,29669,2
29669,Not sure what happened.,29669,2
29669,Nicertainly shirt but since I sent it as a gift it's difficult to return or exchange.,29669,2
29669,Maybe zill have better luck next time.,29669,2
29670,These were not the color I expected them to be and they were too small.,29670,2
29670,I love the style and wish they had been what I was looking for!,29670,2
29671,"Really blousy, but extremely small waist.",29671,2
29671,Very odd fit.,29671,2
29672,I ordered this thinking it would be great to wear over a bathing suit to go to the beach.,29672,2
29672,"You know, something to hide the mommy stretch marks and lack of definition until I get to the beach to blind my children and everyone around with my blindingly white mid section.",29672,2
29672,"that being said, the fabric is nice and thin.",29672,2
29672,Fabric flows nicely.,29672,2
29672,But..The one I received is short and wide.,29672,2
29672,More like for a REALLY petite woman.,29672,2
29672,the racer back is wider then i thought it should be.,29672,2
29672,Its completely sheer.,29672,2
29672,which isn't bad for the purpose i was going to use it for.,29672,2
29672,From the picture I expected a longer black racer back tank top.,29672,2
29672,Would be better for someone with a really short torso.,29672,2
29673,Good fit,29673,2
29674,"Cheap fabrick, runs small.",29674,2
29675,Very thin material,29675,2
29676,Not exactly the item pictured on the site...,29676,2
29677,"Meh, for the price I certainly wasn't expecting it to tear before I actually wore it.",29677,2
29677,The part that connect the bottom to the top was torn and the leg was un threading.,29677,2
29677,Ended up not wearing it because I didn't take I out until Halloween day.,29677,2
29677,"May repair it for next year but it was definitely disappointing,",29677,2
29678,Great timing with the shipment for my surgery!,29678,2
29678,1 pair was broken but I'm good!,29678,2
29679,Nice pants but way too small.,29679,2
29679,I normally wear a large and ordered the 2X according to the measurements but they were still too small,29679,2
29680,way to small,29680,2
29681,Way to small ordered a large and fits like a tight medium.,29681,2
29681,Stitching is horrible there are spots that are overlapped and then also not even sewn.,29681,2
29681,There are also thread strings hanging everywhere.,29681,2
29681,I know the price was kind of on the low side but the quality is more like a 2.00 shirt.,29681,2
29681,Very disappointed.,29681,2
29682,wears poorly.,29682,2
29683,"Tiny, fits and looks nothing like the picture.",29683,2
29683,It really fits like a bra.,29683,2
29683,The quality is not great either.,29683,2
29683,"Can't complain too much for the price though, should have known",29683,2
29684,this was made of some sort of sateen stretch material (not cotton),29684,2
29685,"This bra is really thin, cheap material.",29685,2
29685,It's see-through and has awkward cup liners that look like you've stuffed your bra with circular pads.,29685,2
29685,Not flattering.,29685,2
29686,Runs EXTREMELY small.,29686,2
29686,"I will give it to my daughter I guess, I am sad because I really liked this top.",29686,2
29687,"You known how sometimes you think maybe you should really take heed of the review and not think oh well maybe they don't like it but I will, well I was wrong when it came to this shirt.",29687,2
29687,"First the fabric is so thin and cheap, secondly it fits all types of wrong I was expecting something slight risky with the design across my chest but it practically shows everything.",29687,2
29687,It is so tight across my chest I can't even breathe.,29687,2
29687,I did listen to the reviews and got it 2 sizes bigger but still no luck.,29687,2
29687,I would have even worn a camisole under to get it to look some sort of acceptable but I wouldn't dare try more clothes under for fear of bursting the seams.,29687,2
29687,I am not going to bother returning it as I got what I paid for and will probably just give it away to my neice.,29687,2
29688,It wasn't a man's size XL it was more like a small,29688,2
29689,way too large but good timing!,29689,2
29690,I'm 5'9 and this is in no way long enough to wear with leggings,29690,2
29691,Broke after 1 day of wearing sunglasses ear pad coverup fell off.,29691,2
29691,Not high quality.,29691,2
29692,Will work as a bangle but will not work to hold a hairband; disappointed as that is how it was marketed.,29692,2
29693,I don't really like these.,29693,2
29693,I'm 5'11 and they're too long for me.,29693,2
29693,The belt doesn't sit correctly or in the correct spot.,29693,2
29693,Okay quality though.,29693,2
29694,see through in the white.,29694,2
29694,wish I had gotten the grey.,29694,2
29694,"Runs very small bought for my wife and the large barely fit shes 5'6, 113 lbs",29694,2
29695,REALLY cheap material.,29695,2
29695,Not a trench coat like I thought it would be.,29695,2
29696,really bulkey,29696,2
29697,small rip underneath arm :(,29697,2
29698,"This item seems very large for the size that I ordered, which is rare being that I am curvy.",29698,2
29698,It's not usual for a medium to fit so loose.,29698,2
29698,It looks like a mechanics uniform on me.,29698,2
29698,There's just way to much excess material.,29698,2
29698,I feel like I should be working on someone's vehicle when I put this on.,29698,2
29699,"Not for your helix, well it can be if you have a tiny amount of cartlige...",29699,2
29699,I'm so sad.,29699,2
29700,"My feet didn't feel any better than what I started with and for the price I paid, they should have done something.",29700,2
29700,Dr. Scholls are $2 more and feel much better.,29700,2
29701,"I returned these because there were a few unacceptable things, but I'll start with the positive aspects.",29701,2
29701,The waist size was fine.,29701,2
29701,"I'm a 33 waist, so I order Large as the size chart indicated, and they fit the waist fine.",29701,2
29701,I loved the little pocket sewn along the right leg for carrying some small item.,29701,2
29701,"the inseam, or length of the shorts, was terrible.",29701,2
29701,WAY too short.,29701,2
29701,It was like 4 inches.,29701,2
29701,"So, if I pulled the leg down, then there would be a big gap between the pad and my crotchoidle area, commonly known as the 'taint'.",29701,2
29701,"This is where you want the shorts to be more form fitting, so if you pull them up, then you get daisy dukes in length.",29701,2
29701,"Next, I didn't like the way the padding was sewn into the shorts.",29701,2
29701,"It didn't seem to be attached, and slid around inside the material.",29701,2
29701,So it was a struggle to keep the pad under my sit bones.,29701,2
29702,Wore it 2 times and already have a small hole forming.,29702,2
29702,Not even sure how.,29702,2
29702,Very comfy just cheaply made.,29702,2
29702,Get what you pay for I guess.,29702,2
29703,Should be noted as PETITE; size was horribly off.. large would be a 3x for me.. crazy sizing,29703,2
29704,Does not wick and not soft.,29704,2
29705,"I ordered two of these French Wool Berets, and they fit well.",29705,2
29705,"The Red color is a bright, almost orangish-red instead of the raspberry/burgundy color depicted, and the Turquoise color is actually, definitely a medium-light blue.",29705,2
29705,These colors don't do for my wardrobe what I had hoped.,29705,2
29706,Cheaply made.,29706,2
29707,"Will send it back, because it does not cover enough over my bathing suit.",29707,2
29708,Did not like the material.,29708,2
29708,sent it back.,29708,2
29709,finger print magnet,29709,2
29710,Heavy and uncomforable to wear.,29710,2
29710,I don't like this material at all.,29710,2
29710,Makes my skin feel bad.,29710,2
29711,The top was too big and bottoms way too small!,29711,2
29712,Low cost but to heavy for a wedding band replacement,29712,2
29713,Cute dress but fitting was so wrong.,29713,2
29713,Super tight in the arm area but big everywhere else.,29713,2
29713,I'm done.,29713,2
29714,I have several mala beads and love them.,29714,2
29714,"These feel and look ""plasticky.""",29714,2
29714,"Yes, I made that word up.",29714,2
29714,:),29714,2
29715,The lace broke and the tan color looked dirty right away.,29715,2
29716,waaaaaaay to small.,29716,2
29716,I normally wear an XL but I wanted it roomy so I bought a 2xl and it fit like a large.,29716,2
29717,I was actually pretty disappointed with this item.,29717,2
29717,After looking at the pictures other buyers posted I thought it was going to be okay.,29717,2
29717,"However, when I received this item I immediately put it on and took it off.",29717,2
29717,"The straps are way too in on the bust, plus it doesn't have the same shape as shown in the picture, there is no waist as shown, it's just the part that covers the bust then it comes straight down.",29717,2
29717,"The body portion of the dress is too big, I ordered a size larger than I thought I would need for the bust, which is too small and gives me Uniboob.",29717,2
29717,Not happy.,29717,2
29718,"it fits somewhat weird, doesn't loo as cute as the picture
Also the neck part is a little awkward",29718,2
29719,Not worth buying,29719,2
29720,I put my small LGLeon phone and a lip gloss in the purse and closed it.,29720,2
29720,The fabric came apart from the metal on the top.,29720,2
29720,I was disappointed but was too late about asking for a refund.,29720,2
29721,The color was not as described.,29721,2
29721,It is more of a peach color than pink.,29721,2
29721,I am returning it for one of the other colors.,29721,2
29722,"Nice design, plastic made to look like medal, not a reliable chain broke after two days, would only function as a lightly worn costume jewelry",29722,2
29723,Too short and didn't have pockets.,29723,2
29724,I like the skirt but the photo shows the skirt below the knee and the one I received was very short.,29724,2
29725,Its too small for me.,29725,2
29725,"It doesnt strech, so i cant wear it",29725,2
29726,This jacket is very nice and comfortable.,29726,2
29726,"But if you are 6'2 like me, don't order this.",29726,2
29726,It's to short.,29726,2
29726,And very big on the sides.,29726,2

29729,Not how I that it would be.,29729,2
29730,Dress is beautiful however the dress has already come undone all the seams have fallen out I've only worn it one time and won't be able to until I can get it restitched,29730,2
29731,Dress does not look as pictured.,29731,2
29731,The tutu part was tiered.,29731,2

29732,I returned these as they were not true to size.,29732,2
29732,They ran large.,29732,2
29733,i bought this hat for fishing (southern cali) first time i used it was on a skiff (small boat) after 6 hrs in the sun 87 degrees the hat top seem to look like it was cracking also the straw shifted and in some parts can see through the hat due to spacing being created in a nice big hat but now after 4 uses maybe a total 16 hrs in the sun i doubt it'll make it to next summer,29733,2
29734,"Too big, clips on back missing, fabric cheap looking",29734,2
29735,"The beading was gorgeous, but the tulle & fabric used was not.",29735,2

29741,This dress is very cheap.,29741,2
29741,"The lace on top is cheap and the skirt is poorly sewn, causing one side of the skirt to bubble out awkwardly.",29741,2

29767,Kind of poor quality.,29767,2
29767,Slippers were thrown away immediately.,29767,2
29768,"The dress looks almost nothing like the picture and it has a ripped piece, but the size is accurate.",29768,2
29769,the color does not match the image looks like a cheap shirt.,29769,2
29769,the price is too high for such a simple shirt.,29769,2
29769,I am disappointed,29769,2
29770,It's pretty cheap and pilled after the first wash.,29770,2
29771,not bad,29771,2
29772,The stiches on this skirt is quite bad.,29772,2
29772,The ribbon is attached to dress but the fabric is not long enough to tie the ribbon as big as shown in the picture.,29772,2
29772,The middles part that doesnt have pattern looks a bit weird on me.,29772,2
29772,Have mixed feeling about this dress.,29772,2
29773,Color off....,29773,2
29774,Very thin cheap fabric.,29774,2
29775,Was too tight on my thighs,29775,2
29776,Semi disliked it..,29776,2
29776,It was upsetting seeing that the logo was not stitched on the lanyard.,29776,2
29776,Other than that it's aight.,29776,2
29777,The top was super small.,29777,2
29778,This dress was SUPER cute but the chest was way too big.,29778,2
29778,ROMWE was made for girls with bigger chests.,29778,2
29779,Please beware....the baby special size written 5months is 5 years..ooooo it's not in anyway newborn...but overall very good quality.,29779,2
29780,It was way too small,29780,2
29781,I loved this bag for about 20 minutes.,29781,2
29781,it looks great and holds a lot but it took no exaggeration 20 minutes for the link that holds the shoulder strap to the the jump ring to break.,29781,2
29781,so I fixed it with a different ring I had an thought I'd deal with it but 2 days later the other side broke the same way.,29781,2
29782,Nice like the style,29782,2
29783,Looks fine but is a smaller fit.,29783,2
29783,Debating whether to send back or give it away.,29783,2
29783,No large is this small.,29783,2
29784,Fits good around Bust area but the shirt is too short ...hopefully doesn't shrink when I wash it !,29784,2
29784,I bought another from clothing essentials and theirs is longer...will wrote another review when I wash the shirts to see if I'll ever be able to weather them again,29784,2
29785,"Fabric is a little cheaper, and the back is totally different than in the picture..",29785,2
29785,I will be able to sew up the back a little but wish that it looked more like what was in the photo.,29785,2
29785,Sad that it did not fit right but will wear it as a dress to cover up my swim suit.,29785,2
29786,It want,29786,2
29787,These look good enough but the top ball keeps coming off... On all of them,29787,2
29788,Very pretty but sized too small.,29788,2
29789,"I say cheap not because of the price, but of the quality.",29789,2
29789,The necklace came with a half-scratched off tarnish finish that looked cheap and low quality.,29789,2
29789,It was also very large and clunky.,29789,2
29789,The chain was very thick and plastic.,29789,2
29789,"I tried to switch the chains to a thinner one that I already had, but the charm broke it because of its massive size.",29789,2
29789,"If you're looking for something cute and small, this is not it.",29789,2
29790,Sigh!,29790,2
29790,I was so excited about this swimsuit.,29790,2
29790,I've lost weight & I wanted a sexy swimsuit.,29790,2
29790,This was going to be a great compromise.... because I don't like my stomach especially after having a baby.,29790,2
29790,This swimsuit does do a great job concealing your stomach but still showing a little extra skin.,29790,2
29790,"I am short, BUT this swim suit is made more a VERY SHORT person or someone with a VERY short Torso.",29790,2
29790,I ordered an XL...,29790,2
29790,"I knew I had to order a much larger size, but it still wasn't enough..",29790,2
29790,I am 5'2 I weigh 140 lbs.,29790,2
29790,"So maybe if weighed 10  or 15 lbs less it would fit better, but I don't think it would be Long enough.",29790,2
29790,So if you have a long torso... don't get this suit.,29790,2
29790,"if you have Very Short torso, this is the suit for you.",29790,2
29790,"oh yeah, the bottom part doesn't have a lot of give.",29790,2
29790,I had already planned on wearing this with a race-back bra for support.,29790,2
29790,"So, I can't tell if this suit would be supportive enough or not.",29790,2
29790,I need more support than the average person.,29790,2
29791,I don't like this.,29791,2
29791,"The zipper is too short, making it hard to put on, but thewaistn the was too loose on me.",29791,2
29791,Awkward and bad design.,29791,2
29792,They were extremely too big.,29792,2
29792,Ended up giving them to a friend who was 6'0 and could fit them better than I could...,29792,2
29792,"I'm 5'0, 160 pounds..",29792,2
29792,I should have got a medium.,29792,2
29792,But they were very comfortable,29792,2
29793,Runs very small.,29793,2
29794,"Chintzy, nothing like the ""first editions"" of the Allet line -- which could hold over 20 cards and remain the thinnest on the market.",29794,2
29794,The new ones are smaller and lighter; but far less usable.,29794,2
29794,"I'll probably continue to use my ""old faithful"" Allett, though it's seen better days, and keep the new one for the rare occasions when I need to carry only a few cards and licenses.",29794,2
29794,"Very nice, if you didn't really need a wallet.",29794,2
29795,The XL is like a S!,29795,2
29796,Didn't  fit as well as I expected.,29796,2
29796,Really very pretty in person and needs a little help in the fit department.,29796,2
29796,I ordered a medium and maybe a small would've fit better.,29796,2
29796,Also a bit too short in the length.,29796,2
29797,I'm a about a size 12 so I ordered the 3x since everyone was saying this ran really small.,29797,2
29797,I put it on and it was waaaay too big...the cups fit my boobs (38C) but had absolutely no support so it wasn't flattering at all.,29797,2
29797,"Same with the torso area--it was just too loose to do any sort of shaping or compression, which is what I look for in lingerie.",29797,2
29797,It was also not as long as it is on the model but that might be because I'm 5'7.,29797,2
29797,"I think an xl would have fit better, but it still would have been too short so it's just kind of a lose-lose for me.",29797,2
29797,"I did give two stars because the material seems okay and it is very pretty, but I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a really short torso and very perky breasts.",29797,2
29798,The brim is way too big for my little guy.,29798,2
29798,I keep it on me as an emergency hat only.,29798,2
29799,it is not confutable for kids.,29799,2
29800,Loved steering wheel cover upon arrival.,29800,2
29800,Fit fine on wheel but when turning wheel it will slide around.,29800,2
29800,Has faded considerably in a short amount of time.,29800,2
29800,Will have to replace ASAP.,29800,2
29801,Thumb whole too tight/small,29801,2
29802,"On the small side for an adult small,real problem is the letters are peeling off straight out of the package - it's a gift, no time to return it so I am fixing the letters myself, but disappointing.",29802,2
29803,"This is a very pretty shirt, it's just way too small.",29803,2
29804,"Too small, not for a 4yr old!",29804,2
29804,The purple mitten is the glove we bought from this set compared to my daughter't glove from Burlington Coat factory.,29804,2
29805,Very cheaply made.,29805,2
29805,Poor quality.,29805,2
29806,Flaws in ring.....,29806,2
29806,Deep cut mark on band....  Upper right side of ring Deep cut though ring.....,29806,2
29806,Does not even give impression of being real at all,29806,2
29807,Shoe was very tight for the size.,29807,2
29807,Waiting for another child to grow a little to be able to even use them.,29807,2
29807,:(,29807,2
29808,This product is terrible!!!!,29808,2
29808,It looks cute but in person it's ugly!,29808,2
29808,The seams are terribly stitched.,29808,2
29808,The bottoms are SUPER SMALL and the top has NO PADDING AT ALL!,29808,2
29808,You can see right through it!,29808,2
29808,I would not recommend this to anybody!,29808,2
29809,These pantstruly didn't fit at allim a size 16.,29809,2
29809,I gave them to my daughter she's a size 7 in juniors.,29809,2
29809,So upset want ever buy this brand again,29809,2
29810,Material was extremely thin,29810,2
29811,I think it's a case of the picture being prettier than the actual item.,29811,2
29811,Parts of the necklace looked scratched and pitted.,29811,2
29811,The gems look almost plastic like.,29811,2
29811,If they are crystals they are low end.,29811,2
29811,Mine were scratched.,29811,2
29811,But up close this item is unimpressive.,29811,2
29811,Great for the kids dress up or Halloween costume.,29811,2
29812,This coat looked very cheap and felt cheap.,29812,2
29812,I returned it for better quality.,29812,2
29813,Disappointed.,29813,2
29813,Material is what I wanted.,29813,2
29813,But way small.,29813,2
29813,"If you order, size up one size.",29813,2
29813,Too much trouble to bother to return .,29813,2
29814,"My son wears a size 13 mens shoe, so his feet are huge.",29814,2
29814,"These socks were really hard to get on, but he loves the hulk so much he was determined.",29814,2
29814,He's going to try stretching them out and seeing if he can make them fit.,29814,2
29815,Too baggy and too long in size 42 waist 32 long.,29815,2
29815,I have returned them.,29815,2
29815,Could not find same item in a more traditional fit.,29815,2
29816,not what I expected.,29816,2
29817,They are not typical fold over which normally helps to reduce any bulge around the waste.,29817,2
29817,These are leggings that have a piece of lace sewn around the top so you get the weird waste issues like with non fold over leggings.,29817,2
29817,Will be cute with a loose baggy shirt.,29817,2
29818,It came directly from China in a beat up box with barely any instructions.,29818,2
29818,We had to Google someone else's instructions of even how to get the clasp open.,29818,2
29818,Then it was too small for my brother's wrist.,29818,2
29818,No way to return it or request help.,29818,2
29818,Just wasn't worth the hassle.,29818,2
29818,"It looked pretty cool, but really not worth your time!",29818,2
29819,It's taking longer then I expected it to be,29819,2
29820,"The neckline is kind of low, so you have to be into the way this shirt fits because it doesn't fit like a traditional tshirt.",29820,2
29821,Not a very good fit.,29821,2
29821,"I don't have small ears, but neither do I have gigantic ears, either.",29821,2
29821,This must be made for a very tiny ear.,29821,2
29821,Plus it did not come with a fastener for the back of the earring stick.,29821,2
29822,Timely delivery but shirt runs extremely small.,29822,2
29823,I really hate that this dress didn't fit.,29823,2
29823,"It is really cute, however, it was very small.",29823,2
29823,I even ordered it 2 sizes larger.,29823,2
29823,Really disappointed!,29823,2
29824,Too small,29824,2
29825,Gerber pants are kind of funny.,29825,2
29825,"They have that ""erkel"" crotch thing, where unless the kid is sagging, the pants pretty much cover their chest.",29825,2
29825,what little kid has that much of a need for that super high waist?,29825,2
29825,"I buy a lot of Gerber, because the sales are ridiculously affordable, and am generally pleased.",29825,2
29825,"they run big, but I know that and order smaller.. these however- faded and wore out the color after the first, maybe second wash. that's a shame, because they were cute out of the package.",29825,2
29826,Too tight around the waist,29826,2
29827,Nice idea & at a great prIce but I definitely advise against getting it in white.,29827,2
29827,Material is Tshirt like... thin & see through.,29827,2
29827,Fit well but returned due to being so see through the white looks dingy!,29827,2
29827,I do however like the fit & may reorder in a color.,29827,2
29828,No,29828,2
29829,"Too small, and not long as the picture shows its really uncomfortably short.",29829,2
29829,I got the biggest size and it was a waste of money.,29829,2
29829,I wore it for about ten seconds then gave it away to a child that could fit into it.,29829,2
29830,"Did not fit NCL cruise tags, as they are thinner and about 2 inches longer.",29830,2
29830,"However, they are nice sturdy tags for other things so it wasn't a total waste of money.",29830,2
29831,"its XL and is super small, PLUS, waited 1 month after the package was delivered to grab at the post office, don't understand what happened",29831,2
29832,The star came off after one wash.,29832,2
29833,very hot  not a cool shirt,29833,2
29834,"Feels like plastic, chain not very strong.",29834,2
29835,"To fitted ,gave it to a girlfriend it fit her just right",29835,2
29836,you get what you pay for,29836,2
29837,"Changing my previous review
The metal part is very very bad.it start losing the color with unknowm scratches!",29837,2
29837,"If I'm inside usa of course i'll return it

Mario : the pictures are availabe FYR",29837,2
29838,"Item looks exactly like the picture but fits very large, it is all sequins and the sides will bother the inside of your upper arm.",29838,2
29838,I where a size 12 in dress and have a 38DDD bust and about 42in hips and the XL was too big and did not fit snug at all.,29838,2
29838,I would say order a size down and be prepared to be slightly uncomfortable.,29838,2
29838,due to all the sequins.,29838,2
29839,Made in China Large fits like a small/medium.,29839,2
29839,Had to give it to my daughter.,29839,2
29839,Cute top would have loved if it had fit properly.,29839,2
29839,I should have ordered XL,29839,2
29840,"After two uses by a very careful conscienscious child, it broke.",29840,2
29841,They are really small.,29841,2
29841,"They don't lay like photo shows, the lace sticks straight out to the side making it look more like it belongs on a little girl's ankle socks.",29841,2
29841,I haven never worn them out of my house.,29841,2
29842,"I think this is the first time when I've wished for plastic studs as opposed to metal, but wow are these heavy sunglasses.",29842,2
29842,"I mean, I'll probably still wear them for 15 minutes at a time at Burning Man because I'll always subjugate my comfort to my sense of style.",29842,2
29842,But it didn't have to be like this!,29842,2
29842,There are light weight alternatives!,29842,2
29842,They literally weigh 5 times as much as my favorite sunglasses.,29842,2
29842,And I mean actually literally-- I weighed them.,29842,2
29842,It's 5 ounces perched on your nose.,29842,2
29842,They weigh more than my cell phone.,29842,2
29842,I could throw them at someone and do real damage.,29842,2
29842,These are truly absurd and non functional except as a prop for small intervals.,29842,2
29843,Too small for me have to my little Neice.,29843,2
29844,The bottoms fit perfectly but I never received the top of the swimsuit.,29844,2
29845,"I ordered the XL and when it came in I was hopefully that it would be a little big and snuggly because I wear a M. I not only could not button it, I could barely get my arms in the sleeves!",29845,2
29845,The sizing chart for this is way off.,29845,2
29845,The fabric was soft and it looked great coming out of the bag but the size was all wrong.,29845,2
29845,I ended up donating it to Goodwill.,29845,2
29846,Just not great.,29846,2
29846,Fabricokay okay.,29846,2
29846,My piece lace was coming off,29846,2
29847,"The colors are not what is pictured, the one I got had black instead of brown and koto nearly as much grey, the sleeves are really long and wide at the wrist.",29847,2
29848,Almost the worst online order in my life.,29848,2
29848,"I am sorry but it was all wrong:

I ordered WHITE and it was beige - the ad said thick and it was thin - the fur lining  was cheap and did not go down the arms - finally,  though it fit across the shoulders, the length was so short that the waist tie was so high above the waist that it was under my arm.",29848,2
29848,"So I went to place to contact seller but found the seller was having problems and ""pulling"" items, so I did NOT contact seller I went to Amazon Customer Service and let them look into it.",29848,2
29848,"As always, Saint Amazon was good in providing a refund/no return.",29848,2
29848,"And for my trouble, I did alterations on the thin shell and got lite jacket out of it.",29848,2
29848,"And I think I can get a fun vest from the lining, with some work, too.",29848,2
29848,"Of course, I must now find a warm winter coat still....or wear the old one.",29848,2
29848,Life.,29848,2
29848,Thank you Amazon.,29848,2
29849,Runs big.,29849,2
29849,Very see through.,29849,2
29849,Would have to wear a slip underneath.,29849,2
29850,"It doesn't fit all the abdomen, it is too short.",29850,2
29851,"When I first tried them on, they fit perfectly and looked great.",29851,2
29851,I loved them instantly and was happy.,29851,2
29851,"Right after trying them on, I machine washed them on the gentle cycle.",29851,2
29851,"But when they came out, the threading on the crotch area pulled apart, leaving a gaping hole.",29851,2
29851,I'm thoroughly disappointed in the construction and durability of this item.,29851,2
29851,"Other people seemed to have received a pair with better quality, but I guess it's just a gamble on this brand.",29851,2
29851,:/ I'm going to go back and stick to my usual brands Nike and Champion.,29851,2
29852,Even at the largest size it was too small and I normally wear an XL,29852,2
29853,Does not fit at all like photo.,29853,2
29853,More like a crop top.,29853,2
29854,"Im 5'6 , 135 pounds and this skirt is very very tight on me.",29854,2
29854,I don't recommend this for anyone over 130.,29854,2
29854,Also the skirt stops about mid calves and the front part stops above my knees.,29854,2
29854,The fabric feels like tutu fabric and is very poorly made.,29854,2
29854,Well you get what you pay for.,29854,2
29854,Gave it 2 stars bc it was only $5,29854,2
29855,"I read the reviews, yet still thought it would fit me nicely.",29855,2
29855,I'm an idiot for purchasing it.,29855,2
29856,This shirt looks more like what a waiter in a restaurant would wear.,29856,2
29856,Short length  Disappointed with it.,29856,2
29857,Gave it to a friend.,29857,2
29857,Too small.,29857,2
29858,These all ran very small.,29858,2
29858,The zippers broke on all of them.,29858,2
29858,I did like the fabric & color choices.,29858,2
29859,"These are cute and fit well, but turned my daughter's skin and shirt blue even after the first few washes (including wash before the first wear).",29859,2
29859,The white daisies also became discolored (blue).,29859,2
29859,The blue skin problem may resolve with more washes but I haven't wanted to risk dyeing her again so they're sitting in the drawer unworn.,29859,2
29860,Returned these boots.,29860,2
29860,They run about a 1/2 size too small.,29860,2
29861,It looked nice but I did not read the description which says it does not come with tights yet the pictures all show them so it looks silly with those straps hanging down.,29861,2
29861,"Also, it was too small even at a 2x when I usually wear a L in plus size items.",29861,2
29862,It's supposed to be extra large and it's not but it's pretty,29862,2
29863,Not like the outbreak with the worn look .,29863,2
29863,It looks dark blue fresh off the press .,29863,2
29863,Wasn't what I expected and runs a little small .,29863,2
29864,Top is WAY too small!,29864,2
29864,I am a big 36B and it was uncomfortably small on the top.,29864,2
29864,"Bottom is super cute and flattering though, normally I am a side 1-2 in pants.",29864,2
29865,This bracelet is so stiff.,29865,2
29865,I could not bend it to stay on my wrist.,29865,2
29865,I tried in a vise.,29865,2
29865,Still could not make smaller.,29865,2
29866,If u r a giraffe with legs longer than?,29866,2
29866,The legs came up to my chest in length.,29866,2
29866,Im no hobbit but a few yards of a leg is crappy whith a 38 waist.,29866,2
29866,Need leg measurement???,29866,2
29866,?,29866,2
29867,wasnt what i expected.,29867,2
29867,I didn't like the material at all.,29867,2
29868,"I was sent the wrong size, and will be sending it back.",29868,2
29868,"Otherwise, a nice suit.",29868,2
29869,This sweater smelled like gasoline when I got it and the smell never went away.,29869,2
29869,I also felt like it was cheaply made and never wore it.,29869,2
29869,I also didn't care for the draping in the front.,29869,2
29869,Kind of strange on me.,29869,2
29870,The top portion of this dress is problem.,29870,2
29870,The skirt portion is good.,29870,2
29870,"The problem with the top portion is:
1.",29870,2
29870,"Cheap tank top material
2.",29870,2
29870,It is small to fit chest area.,29870,2
29870,3. the top ends in the middle of my chest area not enough to cover the whole top area.,29870,2
29870,Returning it.,29870,2
29870,My bad I didn't read others reviews before purchasing it.,29870,2
29870,Most of the reviews are correct with my experience.,29870,2
29871,I like how the product  looked on advertise  Picture.,29871,2
29871,I received item and top was to high stopped  right underneath  breast.,29871,2
29871,"Pants were too short  off waist, wish the we're more high waisted.",29871,2
29871,"I did remind myself that I'm a curvy girl I normally  wear M top and L bottom 10/12 5'6"" 178lbs so I ordered  XL to allow  for my hips, thighs, and butt.",29871,2
29871,"Poorly sewn together  loose strings, and back of collar would  not lay flat.",29871,2
29871,I have pictures but I can't  see how to post.,29871,2
29872,The pants are nice and comfortable.,29872,2
29872,But they are NOT the pants in the picture....,29872,2
29872,I paid for them and they're fine I guess so I'll keep them.,29872,2
29872,However if the company would like a better rating from me.... then maybe let me get a pair for free?,29872,2
29873,Either I misread the description of it didn't state fabric content but this product was a very cheap synthetic material.,29873,2
29873,Instantly returned without trying it on.,29873,2
29874,Don't be fooled by the size 5X I would venture to say a 5X would maybe be a ladies large.,29874,2
29874,I bought them for my granddaughter's birthday.,29874,2
29874,I think that they will fit her.,29874,2
29874,I can't see them fitting in the adult person though,29874,2
29875,"When I took the top from the packaging, I thought it was a pajama top.",29875,2
29875,It does not look like the photo with the model in it.,29875,2
29875,"The kicker was when my daughter walked in the room and asked about my new ""bed clothes"".",29875,2
29875,I will keep the top but it will be worn to bed because that is what it looks  like.,29875,2
29876,These are Asian sizes.,29876,2
29876,Had to order TWO sizes up.,29876,2
29876,I am a size 4 and had to order a medium when I usually order a very size small.,29876,2
29876,I am very tall.,29876,2
29876,My weight fluctuates between 115 and 125.,29876,2
29877,Got this as a bday gift for my friend.,29877,2
29877,The paint was wearing off and the silver letterings didn't stand out ..,29877,2
29877,It looked like something you get from a 50c machine.,29877,2
29878,Too small,29878,2
29879,"Too small for my wrist, unfortunately.",29879,2
29879,Didn't look as expected,29879,2
29880,"Cute, but the bow isn't even attached!",29880,2
29880,They come off.,29880,2
29880,they need to either be glued or sewed on.,29880,2
29881,Wider than I expected.,29881,2
29881,Quite stiff and too large.,29881,2
29881,Looks cheaper in person than in photo.,29881,2
29882,"I love the shirt, it just is too small.",29882,2
29883,Unfortunately this just wasn't a winner for me.,29883,2
29883,I don't expect much when buying cheap dresses on Amazon but this was extremely sheer fabric and appeared even more sheer after only one wash. Also at 5'6 140 lbs the size small skirt was too large.,29883,2
29883,I'll still wear it a few times as it looks okay but I wouldn't recommend it to others.,29883,2
29884,"Not quite what I expected, but then again Silver Plated....",29884,2
29884,"I'm glad it is for my 14 Yr. Old daughter, and not me.",29884,2
29885,The fabric pilled the first time I wore it...,29885,2
29886,Material is rough.,29886,2
29886,Not that pleased with how it lays on my body either.,29886,2
29887,"The quality of the print is rough and come off in the wash, according to reviews I was expecting a soft onesie, it is the same as any cheap regular cotton tee, and they run very short length wise for babies body.",29887,2
29887,My 3 month old won't fit the 6month onesie but for maybe the next few weeks.,29887,2
29887,Really disappointed that I paid this much for a onesie that is below par.,29887,2
29888,"The shirts are very loose fitting, the picture does not give a clear indication of fit.",29888,2
29888,"I'm pregnant and ordered an XL, it could be worn as a dress.",29888,2
29888,5'5 and 160 right now.,29888,2
29889,it is not exactly what i expected.,29889,2
29890,I have previously reviewed this item.,29890,2
29890,"Also, item was not what I ordered, similar, but not what was shown.",29890,2
29890,In addition this item was exceptionally small.,29890,2
29890,I decided to keep it and gave it to a friend.,29890,2
29891,Fit large I am 5'5 $165 pounds and 38D bra size this dress looked huge on me te material was ok but don't expect nothing that will last forever i guess the price is right but i returned it because of the fit .,29891,2
29892,This dress is not made for anyone that has a shape.,29892,2
29892,I ordered a large and an extra large and neither of them fit.,29892,2
29892,I am not a large person but I do have hips and was not able to get this dress pass my waist.,29892,2
29893,"I thought this shirt looked so cute, and after reading the reviews I went with a size larger.",29893,2
29893,"When I received the item, I was very disappointed to see the shirt is very long and narrow, it did not fit me the way it was pictured at all.",29893,2
29893,"It is a very cute shirt, but I can only imagine it looking good on a very tall and very thin person.",29893,2
29893,"The material is a very thin, clingy fabric, that makes it look even more awkward.",29893,2
29893,"It is a very pretty, deep wine color.",29893,2
29893,I just wish it would have fit.,29893,2
29893,I contacted the seller and they tried to offer a solution.,29893,2
29893,It would have to be sent someplace overseas.,29893,2
29893,I guess I will just donate it to a local shelter.,29893,2
29894,broke in one day,29894,2
29895,I like this tote but the stitching around the inside clasp is coming loose.,29895,2
29895,I can't return it because it started tearing two days after the 30 day window.,29895,2
29895,"Needless to say, I am very disappointed.",29895,2
29895,I have purchased several Big Buddha purses and have like them all.,29895,2
29895,Disappointed in this return policy.,29895,2
29896,Looks just like the picture and runs big..,29896,2
29896,I love how it looks on me but the material is HORRIBLE!,29896,2
29896,Type of material that as soon as you start moving it stretches out and stays like that..,29896,2
29896,I'm 5'1 155pounds and I got a small..,29896,2
29896,I'm very curvy and still had to get someone to make it tighter .,29896,2
29896,It looks great but so cheap I don't know if I could ever wear it anymore,29896,2
29897,Fit real well but after a few washings the spandex stretches out and they become a poor baggy fit.,29897,2
29897,Don't waste your money.,29897,2
29897,Get the classic fit.,29897,2
29897,They hold there fit.,29897,2
29898,Doesn't fit as expected,29898,2
29899,the hoop was much bigger gauge wise than it stated.,29899,2
29900,I thought I would be getting I higher quality product than what I receive.,29900,2
29900,"It looks good, but when you touch it the leather is much too thin.",29900,2
29900,"The back bottom pocket is too deep to actually try to use, and it get hung on card when you try to pull them out.",29900,2
29900,The straps that hold the money are cheap feeling and I wish they were tighter with an electric feel.,29900,2
29900,My cards were showing out the top of my pants.,29900,2
29900,But the price really can't upset you too much.,29900,2
29900,"It is neat product, probably in the novelty category.",29900,2
29901,"When they advertised  fits ""most sizes"" , I thought that they would be a little long( as I am 5'2) , I did not image they would be too small also.",29901,2
29901,They were too tight  around my legs and they did not stay up on my rear end because they too tight.,29901,2
29901,"Unfortunately, I could NOT return them because I had  tried to wear one pair.",29901,2
29901,"If you wear a small, they might fit you fine.",29901,2
29901,"The next time I order leggings, I shall order a size large not ""fit most sizes"".",29901,2
29902,Ok,29902,2
29903,Too small and the material is not very good quality.,29903,2
29903,I will be returning.,29903,2
29904,"In this case, one size does NOT fit all.",29904,2
29905,I ordered the pink dress and got the red.,29905,2
29905,I usually wear a medium and I'm not sure if the large would even fit.,29905,2
29905,Gave two stars for the design.,29905,2
29906,One came in fine but the other ring was bent when I received it.,29906,2
29907,"The thread started coming apart right out of the box, and it smelled really bad.",29907,2
29907,Sent it back.,29907,2
29908,"I wouldn't think it's ""heavy"" - the 4 ring style is heavy.",29908,2
29909,These are NOT WOMEN'S.,29909,2
29909,The large is super large.,29909,2
29909,Very disappointed.,29909,2
29910,"You get what you pay for, showed up on time though",29910,2
29911,Flimsy and fell apart.,29911,2
29911,Bought it for my teenage daughter and it literally fell apart while she was wearing it.,29911,2
29911,But what do you expect for such a inexpensive item!?!,29911,2
29911,Buy at your own risk.,29911,2
29912,"Headbands were cute, but not great.",29912,2
29912,The knots did not look as nice in person.,29912,2
29912,I ended up returning as the fabric of some of the ones in my pack had several tiny holes in them.,29912,2
29912,They did fit my 4 month old and the fabric was cute though.,29912,2
29912,Just not good quality.,29912,2
29913,cute style if you're super thin.,29913,2
29913,"Otherwise it makes one look huge, larger than in life...",29913,2
29914,I bought the item to hold my dues cards and pictures.,29914,2
29914,It was not dersigned for this because the picture holders are not clear.,29914,2
29915,"Nice looking, but did not fit because he couldn't slide his foot through to the end.",29915,2
29915,Top does not open to adjust so that is the chance you take.,29915,2
29916,Not what I was expecting.,29916,2
29917,It's too small.,29917,2
29917,I have to send it back and get an bigger size.,29917,2
29918,"The only good thing to come of this purchase is they gave me 50% back, as it would of cost
too much to mail it back for a refund.",29918,2
29918,I would of ended up with nothing.,29918,2
29918,"Way to tight and I ordered
the largest size...I wear an 18, but these are like 14 for the 3x....",29918,2
29919,"I liked it when I saw it online, and I liked it when I opened it (although it's a bit shinier than I like) , but it falls short when I use it.",29919,2
29919,"I like a wallet that stands up in my bag, so that I can quickly stick a card, receipt, or change in with one hand.",29919,2
29919,"This one keeps toppling over, even though it has a pretty wide base.",29919,2
29919,I literally have to pull it out of my bag to put anything in.,29919,2
29919,"Too bad, because it does have a ton of room.",29919,2
29920,Fit EXTRA loose,29920,2
29921,Nice product but it was way too small.,29921,2
29922,don't fit properly,29922,2
29923,Cute bag.,29923,2
29923,Love the colors.,29923,2
29923,But after 2 uses the bag has started to come apart at the handles.,29923,2
29924,Cheap material,29924,2
29925,It would look really nice but the color is not the color shown in the pictures.,29925,2
29925,"My hair color is very light so I ordered the light ash and bleach blond and I got something that was a light brownish, off blond color.",29925,2
29925,I don't think I can even find a dye for my hair to match the color.,29925,2
29925,I wanted to wear it at a wedding but I don't think I can wear it at all.,29925,2
29925,"It didn't cost much so I don't feel too ripped off,",29925,2
29926,Wrong color,29926,2
29927,"The quality was good, but the sleeves were about an inch above my wrists.",29927,2
29927,"I am 5'5"" so was surprised the sleeves were too short.",29927,2
29927,Difficult to return.,29927,2
29927,Just kept it for the ease of it.,29927,2
29928,The dress is beautiful.,29928,2
29928,I ordered it last minute for an event and had it one day shipped for my friend's daughter.,29928,2
29928,"She loved it, but when she tried it on there was a thread that was caught so the lining under the dress did not lie flat.",29928,2
29928,"We had to break the thread and then it was ok.  Then, we noticed several areas that were torn in the tulle on the bodice.",29928,2
29928,I was so disappointed.,29928,2
29928,If there was some quality control this would not have happened.,29928,2
29928,"As it was, we were in a pickle, so she wore it to her event with a jacket covering.",29928,2
29928,For the price it was very poorly made and I would not recommend it to anyone.,29928,2
29928,"It would definitely have been returned if we had something else, but there was not time to find a replacement.",29928,2
29928,It was embarrassing to give a defective product to a friend.,29928,2
29929,cute but run on the small side.,29929,2
29929,I would order a size bigger than usual.,29929,2
29930,"Was too small for the giftee, but he wouldn't allow me to return it.",29930,2
29930,"Since it was not the product's fault nor the company's fault that I am unaware of how hats are sized, I agreed.",29930,2
29931,Cute hat..not slouchy at all tho.,29931,2
29931,Small,29931,2
29932,"I was not expecting the nicest coat,but this was much cheaper than I had thought.",29932,2
29932,The button holes do not fit the buttons.,29932,2
29932,They are too small.,29932,2
29932,"It something I can fix, so for the purpose I need it for,  it works, but if your looking for a real coat that will keep you warm, this is not your best option.",29932,2
29933,Fit good.,29933,2
29933,I ordered medium.,29933,2
29933,I'm 4'11 120 pounds.,29933,2
29933,But the bunny upfront is just mess.,29933,2
29933,They could at least sell it for lower since the fabric is so thin n not even smooth.,29933,2
29934,The sweater is a little too smalll,29934,2
29935,"At least 3"" shorter than advertised as a 50"" belt",29935,2
29936,"Although I like the idea of the look of the sweatpants, I say that to say this, I wish they were a bit longer.",29936,2
29936,"But The big problem lays in the crotch, they do not give your package any room to move, and ride up to the point of being uncomfortable, the whole time I am in the gym, I am pulling at the crotch to get relief.",29936,2
29937,It's tight across the bust and too short.,29937,2
29937,Love the color and style and am disappointed that it didn't work for me.,29937,2
29938,small and to be honest just felt like i thick sock,29938,2
29939,Really dark yellow fake looking,29939,2
29940,One of the snaps already broke.,29940,2
29940,A little disappointed.,29940,2
29941,Color is nothing like the picture pale green,29941,2
29942,i ordered a size 40 and it is not even close so i gave it to my daughter it is small enough to fit her,29942,2
29943,I returned it!!!!,29943,2
29943,Sizing is way too small!!!,29943,2
29943,I wish it had fit as it is a very cute top...,29943,2
29944,You can see where the crystals are glued in.,29944,2
29944,They aren't set in the ring as expected.,29944,2
29944,I wear it on my thumb.,29944,2
29944,I had to coat it in clear nail polish because it does turn me green.,29944,2
29945,Was fine until it snapped on the third day of wearing it,29945,2
29946,"The Amazon review system forces you to choose ""somewhat large"" or ""fit as expected"", etc., but in reality, this swimsuit just did not fit well - too large in the hips, and cut wrong in the top.",29946,2
29946,It did not look attractive at all and as my wife said - it was very 80's.,29946,2
29946,"I think that if you had a VERY specific body type, it might look good.",29946,2
29947,I received 6 pairs of individually wrapped undies.,29947,2
29947,The problem was they are not true to size - meaning they run small.,29947,2
29947,"When compared to each other, there were actually 4 different sizes among the 6 pairs.",29947,2
29947,Very disappointing.,29947,2
29947,The material is very thick.,29947,2
29947,"Some may like it, but it felt more like shape wear to me.",29947,2
29947,"Of course, they were too small.",29947,2
29947,I ordered briefs.,29947,2
29947,The legs come down lower than the natural crease of your leg and upper torso.,29947,2
29948,I bought a large T-shirt for my daughter who is usually an adult x-small -small.,29948,2
29948,It was still too small.,29948,2
29948,"I would exchange it for an x-large, but Amazon says return only.",29948,2
29948,"We are stuck with this shirt that she will have to squeeze into, then never be able to wear again.",29948,2
29948,She wanted to wear it many times.,29948,2
29948,I am very frustrated wasting my money like this.,29948,2
29948,"It says ladies large, but fits like a child's medium/large.",29948,2
29949,it's not awful but it is pretty see-through and the arm holes are a bit tight for the x-large.,29949,2
29949,"(I am 5'6"" and 135 lbs)  Definitly not as long on me as the model, hits just below waistband",29949,2
29950,The color was what I expected.,29950,2
29950,However I bought this shirt a couple of sizes big because previous reviews I read and I still could not fit into this shirt.,29950,2
29950,I was really disappointed.,29950,2
29951,"Not a very flattering dress, even for maternity.",29951,2
29951,The underwater is much shorter than the tulle and top portion was a little too large and rather frumpy.,29951,2
29952,Overall ok.,29952,2
29953,It wasn't long enough This is more like a tunic.,29953,2
29953,It's cute but it's not a dress,29953,2
29954,Legs a little small,29954,2
29955,FRAGILE,29955,2
29956,Seam gave after first time wearing.,29956,2
29956,Just does not look like it was stitched properly,29956,2
29957,It fit as expected but the toggle on the side that helps tighten it around the face arrived broken.,29957,2
29958,I ordered this dress for my son's girl friend for prom.,29958,2
29958,She had tried to find a dress but was not able to.,29958,2
29958,"It was pretty, simple and arrived in time for prom.",29958,2
29958,We had already started making another dress when it arrived.,29958,2
29958,She looked at it when it arrived and was afraid to even try it on because it looked too small in the bust area.,29958,2
29958,She did not want to rip it.,29958,2
29958,I returned it without her trying it on.,29958,2
29959,I was expecting a broad belt.,29959,2
29959,I'm was so disappointed when I opened the box.,29959,2
29959,I wasn't what I was expecting.,29959,2
29959,My day was ruined and I felt like I threw away my money.,29959,2
29959,It is leather however and the color is nice,29959,2
29960,Hate how it rolls :/,29960,2
29961,This must be child sizes.,29961,2
29961,"For reference, I wear a size 5/6 jeans and I ordered this in a large.",29961,2
29961,The bottoms gave me a muffin top that I do not have.,29961,2
29961,"The top might have fit A cups, not Ds.",29961,2
29961,I gave it 2 stars because the style is elegant and the material is satisfactory.,29961,2
29961,I will be giving this to my little cousin and I'm sure her size 2 self will love it.,29961,2
29962,Sleeves way too long!,29962,2
29963,The black color with white horse was much smaller.,29963,2
29964,Poorly made and far to small.,29964,2
29965,"Shirt quality seems good, and the fit is right.",29965,2
29965,But what happened to the printing.,29965,2
29965,Very blurry.,29965,2
29965,"I work in the t-shirt printing industry, and this is one of the worst jobs I've seen.",29965,2
29965,"They definitely didn't use the ""Force"" on this one.",29965,2
29965,Stay away.,29965,2
29966,This was to small for me even though I ordered a size Large.,29966,2
29966,"My size is 38, 33, 38 and I usually have no problem fitting into a Large, but not a Large from China.",29966,2
29966,"I gave it away to a family member and she loves it, she is a size 6.",29966,2
29967,This is also a very big pendant.,29967,2
29967,I wanted something smaller and more delicate looking but this is huge.,29967,2
29967,It is well made and does glow in the dark.,29967,2
29968,Made for small frame body..,29968,2
29969,I liked the shirt I got but it was not the shirt pictured.,29969,2
29969,"I ordered a ""maternity"" long sleeve shirt with pocket.",29969,2
29969,I got a weird different cardigan.,29969,2
29970,"Very uncomfortable; hot and sweaty under clothing, and bunches uncomfirtably when you sit down.",29970,2
29971,WAYYYYY too small!,29971,2
29971,Cheap material.,29971,2
29972,"Strap looked really nice, when I received it, but it wasn't very high quality.",29972,2
29972,"After two weeks of using, the locking pin was not holding the strap properly, so I needed to start using another vendor's strap.",29972,2
29973,cheap flimsy thin material,29973,2
29974,Watch out for new sock sizing rules.,29974,2
29974,"Hanes changed the label so what used to be regular-sized women's socks are now considered ""extended size"".",29974,2
29974,"I ordered these ""9-11"" socks, but that doesn't seem to exist anymore.",29974,2
29974,"I was sent socks which are now labeled on the package ""shoe size 5-9"" and they are too small for me, (I wear 8 1/2).",29974,2
29974,"Hanes now labels normal-sized socks ""extended size"" (shoe size 8-12).",29974,2
29974,"Make sure to check the ""size chart"" if you're size 8 and up, and order from a better dealer who is aware of this change and won't just willy-nilly mail out small socks..",29974,2
29975,I unfortunately do not agree with the rave reviews here.,29975,2
29975,I love rose gold but the plating here is done poorly.,29975,2
29975,I do not think you can fool anyone into thinking this is the real thing.,29975,2
29975,The cz offers no depth to the stone.,29975,2
29975,"It's reflects are minimal for the size and ""d"" coloring it mimics.",29975,2
29975,This was supposed to be a vacation set for me but it just didn't work.,29975,2
29976,the lining is much shorter than the dress,29976,2
29977,Actual product looks different from the picture.,29977,2
29977,"I ordered the ""Black Charcoal"" design and had to return the it as it was a different color scheme than what I ordered (Light Gray and Black).",29977,2
29977,"I reordered the ""Black Charcoal"", but received the ""Charcoal Black"" design instead.",29977,2
29977,"However, it does feel nice and it fits perfectly out of the box.",29977,2
29978,The matetial was poor quality,29978,2
29979,It is ok not as good as expected,29979,2
29980,It is coral not pink,29980,2
29981,The hat has weird chin ties not shown in the picture.,29981,2
29981,They look very goofy tied on the baby.,29981,2
29981,Planning to cut them off.,29981,2
29982,Not as long as I expected and it left black residue all over my shurt and hands that was very hard to get off,29982,2
29983,Twisted holders and the color was too light for my taste.,29983,2
29983,They were not flattering,29983,2
29984,This product came on a very cheap looking chain and you can barely tell that there's dandilion seeds in it.,29984,2
29984,"I was expecting something better, but  for the price, I guess you get what you pay for.",29984,2
29985,Two stars because I've owned and currently own multiple pairs of Carhartt pants over many years and these run small in the waist.,29985,2
29985,I cannot wear them without undue discomfort therefore are worthless to me.,29985,2
29985,I don't understand why the same company would vary in size?,29985,2
29985,"I have heard of this happening with other brands needless to say, a review is a review, just that.",29985,2
29985,Furthermore I own other brands in the same size with no problem for fit and comfort.,29985,2
29985,"These are actually waste size 32"" or possibly smaller not 33"" Loose Fit Canvas Carpenter Five Pocket pants.",29985,2
29985,"Other than that no complaints, they're pants.",29985,2
29986,Fit was way too small,29986,2
29987,Drawstring tore open 2nd tome I put on.,29987,2
29988,"Fit like expected, material very goodbut does not lift your butt 
Make it flat not good.",29988,2
29988,I do not believe it is from Colombia!!,29988,2
29988,!,29988,2
29989,They were melted!,29989,2
29989,!,29989,2
29990,The material is comfy.,29990,2
29990,It seems well made and it's really pretty.,29990,2
29990,"It is too snug for me to feel comfortable, so it'll go in thr ""if I lose 10 pounds"" pile.",29990,2
29991,It is really smaller than the size it says.,29991,2
29991,I gave them to my daughter,29991,2
29992,Fell apart within weeks,29992,2
29993,"The title description for this bag included the vital word ""LEATHER"" and I bought the bag based on that description.",29993,2
29993,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the small print which stated that it was ""PU Leather,"" a term that didn't mean anything to me until I looked it up and found that it was a man made product NOT leather.",29993,2
29993,If it isn't truly leather the vendor should not be able to use that word in its description unless it uses the additional descriptor of PU.,29993,2
29993,PU indeed -- this product really stinks!,29993,2
29994,broke,29994,2
29995,This is an extremely cute top.,29995,2
29995,When I took it out it looked like it would fit...,29995,2
29995,"But no, way too small... Not getting this over my chest area lol.",29995,2
29995,It would probably fit fine for anyone without boobs.,29995,2
29996,"Nice look, quality decent... runs small.",29996,2
29997,Love the designs but the acrylic is just such a negative thing.,29997,2
29997,It hurts my ears and makes the smell way way worse than they should.,29997,2
29997,One pair got stuck and I had to break the back off with pliers.,29997,2
29997,I'd recommend finding a way to get these made out of a different material.,29997,2
29998,Broke the first week I got it,29998,2
29999,NEED TO BE LARGER !,29999,2
29999,!,29999,2
29999,BEAUTIFUL BUT SMALL,29999,2
30000,String stiching started coming out in a matter of days and its not that stretchy,30000,2
30001,It's a super cute shirt but only if you are teeny tiny will it fit.,30001,2
30001,I ordered a large and it fit more like a small.,30001,2
30001,The company was very easy to work with after I had let them know how small it was.,30001,2
30002,Runs small very small like an XL is a small and you can see right through the white tank.,30002,2
30003,The needles are good but the rings are cheep,30003,2
30004,The sizing is off.,30004,2
30004,"I'm a US Medium, so I ordered the medium thinking it would be a little more snug than usual since it's slim fit, but it honestly just fit like a normal, kinda oversized shirt.",30004,2
30004,Wouldn't recommend.,30004,2
30005,Very pretty but stone came loose with in a week of wearing it,30005,2
30006,Cute but way too small,30006,2
30007,"Nice looking ring, BUT, turned color very quickly and left color on hand after first wear.",30007,2
30008,"It said large on the label, but it was actually much much smaller.",30008,2
30008,I was never going to wear it and gave it to my grand daughter.,30008,2
30009,Super cute but runs EXTREMELY small!!!,30009,2
30009,They weren't kidding!,30009,2
30009,No way is the women's XL equal to a size 8.,30009,2
30009,It's more like a child's XL.,30009,2
30010,Looks nothing like the photo.,30010,2
30010,Expect the color is the same.,30010,2
30010,Very see-thru.,30010,2
30011,Doesn't really provide support for me and kind of makes my breasts look lumpy.,30011,2
30011,"The accessibility for breast feeding is nice, but it just feels like there's a band around my rib cage and not much else, even when it's closed and snapped.",30011,2
30012,The color blue looks very different from the picture.,30012,2
30012,Its cheap and very cheap looking.,30012,2
30012,I do not recommend.,30012,2
30013,The arms were too small and you couldn't wear a sweater underneath.,30013,2
30014,Does not look like what's in the picture.,30014,2
30015,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.,30015,2
30015,I bought a size 8 which is the size he wears.,30015,2
30015,The top fit perfectly but the bottoms were way too short.,30015,2
30015,They came up to mid-calf.,30015,2
30015,It was 2-3 sizes too small.,30015,2
30015,I was very disappointed with the product and would not order again from this company if that's the way they size things.,30015,2
30016,Nice socks but way too small!,30016,2
30017,Ordered this for my husband.,30017,2
30017,I washed it and it shrunk 2 sizes!,30017,2
30017,He can't wear it and I can't return it...,30017,2
30018,Kind of cheap but good for over suits,30018,2
30019,IS FRESH,30019,2
30020,This product is rather cheaply made and not big enough for my power strip.,30020,2
30020,I guess you get what you pay for.,30020,2
30020,At least it wasn't very much in this case.,30020,2
30021,Seemed not true to size...bummer.,30021,2
30022,These could keep your hands warm if you weren't in the snow.,30022,2
30022,But 3 hours after skiing my hands were wet.,30022,2
30022,Would not recommend them for a ski trip.,30022,2
30023,"Really cute,material not the best, and should really consider ordering a size bigger.",30023,2
30024,was little dissapointed.,30024,2
30024,even after giving the measurements.,30024,2
30024,recieved no reply that the email was recieved.,30024,2
30024,now its too big.,30024,2
30024,have to pay a seamstress.,30024,2
30024,wouldnt buy again,30024,2
30025,Very prettyy,30025,2
30026,Honestly the swimsuit I received looks absolutely NOTHING like the images...,30026,2
30026,The bottoms are WAY TOO SMALL so I had to give them away but the top seems okay...,30026,2
30026,I have worn it before and it is good quality but it makes your breast look saggy.....,30026,2
30026,I don't recommend buying this and I would rather spend a little more money on a better swimsuit!!!,30026,2
30026,!,30026,2
30027,I didn't love these.,30027,2
30027,"They did fit as expected, so that's good.",30027,2
30027,"But the fabric didn't have any heft to it, so they kind of sunk into any bulges and lumps.",30027,2
30027,"I have a different pair from a different brand, and they slide on and are so flattering.",30027,2
30027,These didn't.,30027,2
30027,They also had such a high waist that it pulled in the crotch area.,30027,2
30027,Just not great for me.,30027,2
30027,I returned.,30027,2
30028,"Reason why I'm not giving a five is bc they glow in the dark but I got the wrong size I ordered 7/16 11mm and almost had a blowout bc I didn't notice they we're 1/2"" 12mm until they we're in my ears and making them feel very uncomfortable",30028,2
30029,.,30029,2
30030,Stretches a  bit after washing but it warms.,30030,2
30030,Seems a bit large,30030,2
30031,"I thought that this was a really cute top, so I bought it.",30031,2
30031,I ordered size XL.,30031,2
30031,"When I got it, I couldn't come near to getting it on.",30031,2
30031,It was TOO small.,30031,2
30031,It should have been sized S or XS.,30031,2
30031,I'm not returning it because it would have to go all the way to China.,30031,2
30031,"For the cost of the shirt, I decided that I would just donate it a locale charity.",30031,2
30032,"Did not meet  my expectation, size is too small , size is meant for girls",30032,2
30033,Charms fell off on the first day.,30033,2
30034,One of the pins of the earrings bent the first time i used it.,30034,2
30035,My 10 year old son has used them 3 times and they are coming apart at the toes and the back of one where you pull it on is falling apart.,30035,2
30036,Its okay....,30036,2
30037,"Not really what I thought it would be, the strapped kept popping off, it was very uncomfortable.",30037,2
30038,Returned it.,30038,2
30038,Does not look like the picture,30038,2
30039,"I bought this item for my wife and the second we went to adjust the time, it broke.",30039,2
30039,She still loves the look so we're gonna keep it for the looks but buy at your own risk.,30039,2
30039,It's a pretty easily breakable item.,30039,2
30040,I returned this item because I didn't like the material.,30040,2
30040,It seemed too thin and didn't stretch at all.,30040,2
30041,This top definitely runs small.,30041,2
30041,I ordered a size up since I've read the same thing in other reviews but even with a size up its snug in all the wrong places.,30041,2
30041,From the pic you would expect this top to be somewhat flowy towards the bottom but it's snug all the way down through your middle.,30041,2
30041,"I'm 5""7 140lbs and I usually wear a small or medium.",30041,2
30041,I ordered a large and it was still to snug for the style.,30041,2
30041,"I'll still wear it, but probably not often.",30041,2
30041,The material is also a bit off putting.,30041,2
30041,It's feels very much like spandex.,30041,2
30041,As if it's a top to go excersise in instead of casual wear.,30041,2
30041,"It is pretty, snug or not, and the style is cute.",30041,2
30042,Not what I thought I ordered.,30042,2
30042,I ordered this mask to use during meditation.,30042,2
30042,I can still see light under the bottom part of the eye mask and the Velcro curls so I have to flatten it out before I lay down or I can feel a bump on my head.,30042,2
30042,It took over two weeks to get to me and came all the way from China.,30042,2
30042,I would have returned it but it was too much hassle.,30042,2
30042,"However, I do use it everyday and it's okay.",30042,2
30042,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,30042,2
30043,runs really small,30043,2
30044,uncomfortable on skin horrible for fabric,30044,2
30045,It was smaller then what I thought it would be.,30045,2
30046,Very nice dress but the size did not fit her at all.,30046,2
30046,Buy big if you but it.,30046,2
30047,It looked bright although not as great in the photo.,30047,2
30047,But the material is very cheap and I doubt can be worn in summer.,30047,2
30047,"It fits smaller too (specially armpit, bust).",30047,2
30047,I returned it.,30047,2
30048,Stones are not set.,30048,2
30048,they fell out in transit.,30048,2
30049,"The pockets in the jacket are incredibly small, my wife's hand wouldnt fit in the pocket.",30049,2
30050,Like the colors but to big,30050,2
30051,It gets 2 stars for how cute it is and the speed of delivery.,30051,2
30051,But wow if you'd is an xl..i must be a xxxxl.,30051,2
30051,Its tiny.,30051,2
30051,Rally disappointed and won't be able to wear it.,30051,2
30051,Ill give it to someone with no boobs and a tiny waist.,30051,2
30051,Material is nice.,30051,2
30051,Colors are bright like the photo but not true to size at least for me.,30051,2
30051,And i even ordered a size up!,30051,2
30051,!,30051,2
30052,"I wanted to like it, but it was soooo SMALL.",30052,2
30052,It is beautiful tho.,30052,2
30053,"Arm hole where WAAAAAYYYYY to small, its super short and I order 3 size up and its still didn't fit, so if your on the thicker side I wouldn't buy.....",30053,2
30053,The only reason I gave it two stars is because it was super cute just cant fit,30053,2
30054,Way too small,30054,2
30055,Cheap material.,30055,2
30055,I would not recommend.,30055,2
30056,Super cute.,30056,2
30056,No dick space.,30056,2
30057,I haven't been able to wear it and am thinking about giving it away!,30057,2
30058,Totally see thru not as pictured in the black and cheap fabric.,30058,2
30059,I really wanted to like these glasses.,30059,2
30059,"Super cool, very hip, and they feel like upper end glasses.",30059,2
30059,Very sturdy and the stylng of the packing and the case is awesome.,30059,2
30059,"However, I noticed that when I put the glasses on the the frame was uneven.",30059,2
30059,The glasses didn't sit evenly upon my face.,30059,2
30059,I'm going to return the glasses because if I wanted uneven glasses I would go to the dollar store.,30059,2
30060,Not good for women over 45 if your derriere has dropped at all.,30060,2
30060,the elastic does not keep you in.,30060,2
30060,I believe someone else had the same review.,30060,2
30060,I should have heeded it.,30060,2
30061,I ordered a Medium size (I'm usually a Small size) and the bottom is way too small!,30061,2
30061,"The top fits ok (I'm a 34C), but the fabric is not the best.",30061,2
30061,"The fabric of the bottom is good and the design is really pretty, but sadly, I will not be able to wear it.",30061,2
30061,"If you can, order two sizes up, so you can fit in the bottom, but you'll probably will have to fix the top.",30061,2
30062,I order one size up and it was still to small  I was so sad it's so cute,30062,2
30063,its too long..,30063,2
30064,"Love the price, but you do get what you pay for.",30064,2
30064,The leggings are very opaque which is the biggest PRO about them.,30064,2
30064,"BUT after ordering two sets of these, only 2 have the elastic in the waistband, and the 2 that don't CONSTANTLY roll down, so I'm forever hiking them back up.",30064,2
30064,It's such a constant annoyance that I don't wear them often (only on laundry days).,30064,2
30064,"Of the 2 with the elastic, the grey ones have a very tight elastic that cuts into the belly, so the black pair is the only one that fits comfortably.",30064,2
30064,"I do like how they come up high enough to hold in the lower pooch area, but I won't be ordering these again since the quality is so very inconsistent.",30064,2
30065,Maybe it's just not made for my body but it looked really weird.,30065,2
30065,The shoulders have a strange situation going on- it just didn't work.,30065,2
30066,"Cute, but my size extra large is a small.",30066,2
30067,cute but I can't use them - too small.,30067,2
30068,cheap,30068,2
30069,Cracked easily- poor quality,30069,2
30070,I purchased this dress before from a different vendor.,30070,2
30070,So I was expecting it to be similar to the other one.,30070,2
30070,It was shorter and the material was more like costume material.,30070,2
30070,"The dress is lined with a stretchy white material, not a slip like material usually used to line clothing.",30070,2
30070,"Overall it just seems to be very cheaply made, but it wasn't real costly either.",30070,2
30070,"I am keeping it, but it will be a lake cover up or a around the house item.",30070,2
30071,This item is so misleading.,30071,2
30071,I am 5'7 and generally a perfect medium - and so I bought a medium in this.,30071,2
30071,But the fit is strange.,30071,2
30071,"The longest part of the shirt in the front is short, and it's like two flower petals coming together front and back which leaves huge gaps on the sides.",30071,2
30071,"If I were to get a larger size so that it would fall longer in the front and back, then it'd be so low cut that it'd be below my breasts in the front.",30071,2
30071,I'll let you view my pics and decide for yourself if you can pull off this style.,30071,2
30071,This was just NOT what I was looking for.,30071,2
30072,Unfortunately the top was too small for me.,30072,2
30072,I ordered a medium and then a large and it was still too small for someone who is a 32DDD.,30072,2
30073,made of paper,30073,2
30074,"Sizing off and style wasn't liked by the ""Boss"".",30074,2
30074,I returned it.,30074,2
30075,This was a gift for my daughter-the pendant is super cute but the chain that we received is very short-16 inches- and doesn't even have a clasp.,30075,2
30076,I got my self the large size but it was still too small for me.,30076,2
30077,"The scarf is pretty enough, I ordered the pink and blue expecting there to be blue in the scarf, like in the picture.",30077,2
30077,Under the lights in the room in which I opened the box it looks pink and white.,30077,2
30077,In the right lighting and looking very closely you can squint enough to make the white seem blue-ish at the edges.,30077,2
30078,Thigh highs more like knee high these don't go past my knees.,30078,2
30079,I' m a little upset due to the fact I ordered 2 an only received 1.. they don't lift my butt but it flatten my stomach a little would I recommend this yes can't beat the price an they are comfortable,30079,2
30080,Wasn't the best material.,30080,2
30080,I wouldn't buy this product again.,30080,2
30081,Shirt has a made for girl cut neck and pants were not wide enough for my kids legs.,30081,2
30081,(Chubby baby),30081,2
30082,The bust area was perfect time however it was too tight around my butt and it was too short.,30082,2
30083,"I'm a pretty petite person, so I'm not surprised this was too large.",30083,2
30083,"However, I was pretty surprised that this 'Nursing Gown' didn't actually have any easy access points for baby.",30083,2
30083,You're basically just pulling the material around/down from the source.,30083,2
30083,"To me, this is just a regular night gown, that you might be able to stretch out and 'make work' but that's not how it's listed/described.",30083,2
30084,This is a really beautiful product -- the colors are vibrant and both I and my stepdaughter -- the recipient -- loved the design.,30084,2
30084,HOWEVER.,30084,2
30084,It is entirely too small for her.,30084,2
30084,":( I ordered a Large, because I knew it would be smaller, but it fit almost like a Small.",30084,2
30084,"She is 5'4"" and about 130 pounds, so she normally wears a Medium and I should have gotten an XL for her.",30084,2
30084,":(

It also isn't a sweater, like the picture indicates, but a 3/4 sleeve shirt.",30084,2
30084,"At least, that's how hers was.",30084,2
30084,It is a decent product if you know what to order.,30084,2
30085,Very cheep looking!,30085,2
30085,"""Stones"" are cloudy looks like plastic.",30085,2
30085,Will be throwing it in with the Halloween stuff,30085,2
30086,It looks like a shirt on me and I ordered a medium.,30086,2
30087,i did not buy this,30087,2
30088,Gave away to a teen.,30088,2
30089,I ended up having to replace the closure on the bracelet.,30089,2
30089,The one that came on it didn't even close.,30089,2
30089,"Luckily, I make jewelry & had a replacement at home.",30089,2
30089,But it was embarrassing to give it as a Christmas gift and watch my sister-in-law be unable to put it on.,30089,2
30090,pattern on shirt isn't biologically correct,30090,2
30091,Too long to ship.,30091,2
30091,Too small in size.,30091,2
30091,Too loose at the neck and droopy at the neck.,30091,2
30092,Had to return.,30092,2
30092,Bottom too small and top too large.,30092,2
30093,This is not a dress .,30093,2
30093,I am 5'4 and it is a thigh high blouse.,30093,2
30094,couldn't read the top lines.,30094,2
30095,"While these pants are adorable, even the XL size has pipecleaner narrow legs.",30095,2
30095,Too many clothiers will make the waistband or chest of a piece of clothing larger without any regard for arms and legs.,30095,2
30095,When you size up a garment ALL the pieces must be adjusted.,30095,2
30096,Runs small,30096,2
30097,I've had this for 2 months and it is NOT holding up well.,30097,2
30097,I've gone on two trips in the past two months and wore this for about 2 whole days cumulatively.,30097,2
30097,The side of the bigger pocket is completely ripped open.,30097,2
30097,"I mostly sat in cars/planes while wearing it, so this wasn't put through any grueling activity.",30097,2
30097,"It held my passport, money, and plane tickets.",30097,2
30097,"Seriously, it should be in near excellent condition right now.",30097,2
30098,"Orders xlg so it would be a little baggy, but it was more like a petite large.",30098,2
30098,"Fabric is thin, also.",30098,2
30098,The lace was the best part.,30098,2
30099,Quickly starts to deteriorate.,30099,2
30099,But it's cheap.,30099,2
30100,"Okay, Let me say 1st.",30100,2
30100,You get What you pay for!!,30100,2
30100,Lol So with that in mind.,30100,2
30100,The bracelet is okay.,30100,2
30100,"It's like a rose gold color... Not to fond of, Only because the other one I wear on the other ankle is more like an 14k gold colour.",30100,2
30100,2) I have small ankles & there isn't much chailn left hanging.,30100,2
30100,"Good for me, Not so much for women with wider ankles than myself.",30100,2
30100,3) Although it arrived earlier than the expected delivery date.,30100,2
30100,It took over 3 weeks plus to even arrive... OMG I ALMOST FORGOT THE BEST PART!!,30100,2
30100,MY HEART IS SIDE WAYS.,30100,2
30100,"SOOO, It's definitely not quite what tge picture is advertising.. Now may be it's just mine..",30100,2
30100,"I'm not sure.. Lastly, The 2 chains won't stay seperated, Like the pic..",30100,2
30100,Overall.,30100,2
30100,I wouldn't suggest nor recommend this....even for the low cost of $2 plush shipping,30100,2
30101,My wrist measures exactly 8 inches and the bracelets are very tight.,30101,2
30101,"I would say bracelet measures 7.8""",30101,2
30102,Looks very nice but I found that it started getting discoloured quick,30102,2
30103,Lightweight.,30103,2
30103,"Expected the fabric to be a bit thicker, felt nice though.",30103,2
30103,"not a ""warm"" shirt for outdoors.",30103,2
30103,Nice assembly.,30103,2
30104,cheaply made,30104,2
30105,Nice quality but sizes are way small.,30105,2
30105,Had I known I would have but a size or two bigger.,30105,2
30106,"- it's very easy to broken :""<",30106,2
30107,The bottom portion is see through.,30107,2
30108,"These just didn't work for me--I love RBX tops, but their tights aren't a good fit for me.",30108,2
30108,"I have very muscular legs, small hips, and medium waist.",30108,2
30108,"The tights are too tight in the wrong places, baggy where they need to cling.",30108,2
30108,"Too bad as I really like the colors, pattern, and overall quality.",30108,2
30109,This is a pretty bad cut and just uncomfortable shirt.,30109,2
30109,These had me wishing for the Calvin Klein crew i usually use.,30109,2
30110,Awful.,30110,2
30110,"I'm convinced this is what these sellers on amazon do: Find a picture of a clothing item that belongs to another company, steal it for their own use,  then copy it and make a cheap knock-off of it and sell it using that picture.",30110,2
30110,This shirt is like something a child made.,30110,2
30110,Getting sick of this crap happening on amazon.,30110,2
30110,Shirt looks tacky in person.,30110,2
30110,Very poorly made.,30110,2
30110,Waste of money.,30110,2
30111,Too small,30111,2
30112,Little odd stitching,30112,2
30113,"The swim suit is cheaply made, it runs VERY small.",30113,2
30113,"I ordered a 2x, the top fits more like a medium and the bottoms got more like a large, so they are not even proportionate.",30113,2
30113,"It took a long time for the suit to be delivered, which was expected, but I was highly disappointed in the quality and sizing differences.",30113,2
30113,Luckily I had a friend who was able to wear the suit.,30113,2
30113,"If you have a larger chest, do not waste your time on this one!",30113,2
30114,Unfortunately this broke within 24 hours of me using it.,30114,2
30115,Couldn't fit this,30115,2
30116,2 stars for design only.,30116,2
30116,The shirt feels like polyester and doesn't sit right .,30116,2
30116,It keeps sliding up .. creating a very unflattering shape..,30116,2
30116,I'm athletic build and it doesn't flatter my shape at all.. please save your money.,30116,2
30117,"I ordered a XXL as this is the size shirts I wear, however this shirt was way too tight.",30117,2
30117,It did not flow like it seemed like it would from the pictures.,30117,2
30117,I returned it & didn't want to order the next size up in case it was still too small.,30117,2
30117,So for sure order a size bigger if you order!,30117,2
30118,Although I like the look of the necklace it arrived broken.,30118,2
30118,Should be an easy fix yet one I shouldn't have had to make.,30118,2
30119,Flimsy didn't fit or feel good,30119,2
30120,"Given the picture and description ""rainbow"" I was expecting bright colored gloves.",30120,2
30120,"Instead I received 4 pairs of dark maroon, 2 brown, 2 charcoal, 1 black, 2 light grey and 1 pink.",30120,2
30120,Not what I wanted for my daughters ice skating party.,30120,2
30120,Also the gloves are adult size not kid size,30120,2
30121,"I ordered these leggings after reading the reviews, good and bad.",30121,2
30121,"The pros are that they fit well, the material is great and not see through as many leggings are and super comfortable.",30121,2
30121,"I worked out in them earlier and have worn them all day, but from moving up and down it looks there was a snag/run from one of the main stitches and because of the material, it can't be sewn.",30121,2
30121,"Nor can I longer wear them, as the snag is actually see through and in a very unfortunate spot.",30121,2
30121,So 7 hours of wear and $20 down the drain.,30121,2
30121,:/,30121,2
30122,The shirts shrunk after washing,30122,2
30123,"The only reason why I checked off the ""Fit as Expected"" box is because I looked at the sizing chart prior to purchasing.",30123,2
30123,"I am usually a size small , but I ordered this top in a Large.",30123,2
30123,It arrived today and I was quite surprised to see how small it was for being a size large.,30123,2
30123,It looks like a real XS !,30123,2
30123,The color of the top is not as shown in the photo.,30123,2
30123,"The color I received is a very dark blue, almost a sapphire blue and has quite a shiny sheen to it.",30123,2
30123,The material reminds me of a thinner version of a polyester napkin you'd see on a table in  a banquet hall.,30123,2
30123,"Very chintzy, to say the least.",30123,2
30123,But.......,30123,2
30123,I got what I paid for.,30123,2
30123,My advice is to save the $9 and buy yourself a couple of lattes at Starbucks instead.,30123,2
30123,Some previous reviews I just read said returning the item is virtually impossible.,30123,2
30124,The fabric is too bright.,30124,2
30124,It is an eyesore.,30124,2
30125,They ripped on the third day,30125,2
30126,It's cheap and that's all I have to say,30126,2
30127,Useful product if you own a solar watch.,30127,2
30127,I received a bad unit so cannot award it's highest rating.,30127,2
30127,Three stars deducted for quality in workmanship.,30127,2
30127,One LED momentarily flickers when initially switched on then goes out and does not come back on.,30127,2
30127,Not returning since all other LED's stay on for the duration of my charge schedule.,30127,2
30127,Unit stays on 24 Hrs continuously to charge several Eco-Drives in rotation.,30127,2
30127,Charging schedule is once a month.,30127,2
30127,Good purchase if you are aware of possible QC issues.,30127,2
30128,Sadly this arrived much too small even though I ordered multiple sizes up.,30128,2
30128,"The material is not coat material, it is almost sheer and blouse-like.",30128,2
30129,"I like the style and size and color,but I don't like the gold buttons.",30129,2
30129,They looked weird.,30129,2
30130,"Smaller than expected, got damaged in packaging ):",30130,2
30131,Not at all what I expected.,30131,2
30131,The picture is cute but what I received was of poor quality.,30131,2
30131,Loose threads and unmanageable collar after one wash.,30131,2
30131,I got one wear out of it.,30131,2
30132,Won't work on haeaver material.,30132,2
30133,"it is a pretty dress on the picture but in reality all the white accents are made with a cheap looking, thick, cotton trim and the dress itself is synthetic which gives it a very cheap and mismatched look.",30133,2
30133,I never sent it back but I also never wore it and probably never will.,30133,2
30134,These were huge!,30134,2
30135,I ordered the largest size and it was way to tight in the chest.,30135,2
30135,The material was completely see through but I wasn't expecting much.,30135,2
30135,The shipping time was excellent.,30135,2
30135,Other than the issues it was cute I will just have to give it to my friend!,30135,2
30136,"Pretty, but the liner is shirt length.",30136,2
30136,I had to return and it definitely runs small.,30136,2
30137,Poor quality.,30137,2
30137,I didn't expect this fabric.,30137,2
30137,I don't like this.,30137,2
30138,The print was more blue than black and low resolution.,30138,2
30139,I thought his shirt was going to be perfect to use for pressing vinyl on but once it's washed it shrinks way too much.,30139,2
30139,I love the feel but not worth it to only hand wash.,30139,2
30139,Guess I should have looked up if it's hand wash only and that its 100% rayon.,30139,2
30139,It's fine if you don't wash it.,30139,2
30140,"Bought the red, but it was closer to Orange.",30140,2
30141,I won't wear it unless I lose 50 pounds.,30141,2
30141,It makes me look like I'm pregnant with or without a belt.,30141,2
30141,Fits good just not very flattering on a larger lady.,30141,2
30141,"I'm 5.4"" and bout 200 pounds.",30141,2
30141,If you are skinny mini you can pull it off.,30141,2
30141,Maybe if I were a couple inches taller I could too.,30141,2
30141,Oh well.,30141,2
30142,Looks pretty.,30142,2
30142,But material feels like plastic.,30142,2
30142,Order a small but it actually quite big.,30142,2
30143,It turned a little to quickly!,30143,2
30144,Oddly made and was made cheaply,30144,2
30145,"This dress is very pretty and soft material, however if you even have a small pudge, it shows!",30145,2
30145,Made me look a bit pregnant lol.,30145,2
30145,It is definitely a dress for very skinny woman :),30145,2
30146,"Doesnt quite look as pictured, feels cheap",30146,2
30147,"I like the dress, but I don't like that t's supposed to be a XXL but it's actually a size 12.",30147,2
30148,"Looks cute, but way too small.",30148,2
30148,I couldn't even put it on over my chest!,30148,2
30149,Not a pictured.,30149,2
30149,I didn't like the way it fit me looks cheap.,30149,2
30149,Just ok,30149,2
30150,The item was extremely small,30150,2
30151,Size is smaller than states,30151,2
30152,Quality isn't very good and it also doesn't fit right.,30152,2
30152,The bottom seems too large and baggy and the top does not cover well.,30152,2
30152,Seems too small.,30152,2
30152,The color is also not as vibrant as pictured.,30152,2
30153,Did not fit.... more like an XL than a plus 1x-3x,30153,2
30154,"I returned the dress on January 4 and did receive credit for the dress price on January 25, 2015.",30154,2
30155,the cross slips out of the loop.,30155,2
30156,Nice chain but clasp broke within a week.,30156,2
30157,Great quality but I ordered 0-6 months and looks like a 2T.... disappointed,30157,2
30158,"A very small medium, very short on the bottom.",30158,2
30158,Very disappointed.,30158,2
30159,The ring looked nice but the quality is lacking.,30159,2
30159,The ring was delivered to me and some of the stones were missing so I was quite disappointed.,30159,2
30159,I would recommend spending the extra money and getting something that's better quality.,30159,2
30160,"Not a very well made product, doesn't fit well either, hangs poorly.",30160,2
30160,Would not purchase again.,30160,2
30160,"The color is right, in general the top fits much shorter than the tunic-like length that is shown but is made very cheaply, I most likely won't even wear but to return it isn't even worth the shipping.",30160,2
30160,What a shame,30160,2
30161,Real cheap looking - I ended up giving it away as it was not worth the fees to return it.,30161,2
30162,It sucks...!,30162,2
30162,Not the full picture and and the size was way off...!,30162,2
30162,And what I mean by not full picture is that it doesn't even show his hands....!,30162,2
30162,Only face and shoulders...!,30162,2
30163,This dress is VERY sheer.,30163,2
30163,"their is a ""V"" of fabric in the front and back making it decent enough to wear in public but the sides are still see through.",30163,2
30163,I wish this wasn't the case but sadly it is more of a swim cover up than anything else.,30163,2
30164,Nice design but poor quality.,30164,2
30165,These bras fit very small and were very tight.,30165,2
30165,"I wore one to work for one day, and by the time I came home, I almost felt like I was bruised.",30165,2
30165,They would probably be great in a larger size.,30165,2
30165,I'd recommend going up a size or two.,30165,2
30166,They were pretty...but the prongs holding the center stone were sharp and stuck out.,30166,2
30166,Wouldn't buy again!,30166,2
30167,Cheaply made material.,30167,2
30167,Doesn't sit down well on head.,30167,2
30168,It's cuter in the picture but I ordered up and it fits fine except in the boob area where it's tight and the cups are way to small.,30168,2
30168,I'm a triple D. If I go up a size I'm sure it would be bigger at bottom.,30168,2
30169,"Ripped second use, fit is large",30169,2
30170,"The sizing is crazy, my wife is 5'7"" and 120 lbs and couldn't fit into a medium.",30170,2
30170,These will only fit tiny tiny women.,30170,2
30171,Ouch!,30171,2
30171,Enough said - you get what you pay for.,30171,2
30171,Perfect for one of those panty clothes line games for a Bach party if you wear them for your significant other just take them off before the action gets too frisky,30171,2
30172,The chest part of this swimsuit made my breasts pointy and didn't fit right at all there.,30172,2
30172,And the back part of the skirt wasn't long enough.,30172,2
30173,"I bought this in a 12/14, and it was WAY too clingy.",30173,2
30173,"It was highly disappointing, as the two patterns I bought were very cute, but the dresses were just too small.",30173,2
30173,"I normally wear a 12, but it was like I was a 12 lb sausage in an 8 lb case.",30173,2
30173,I wasn't invested enough in the dresses to try and return them for something larger.,30173,2
30173,"I think this would work best on a body type that is already smaller and isn't curvy, as the style of this dress was not flattering to my curves.",30173,2
30173,"It was disappointing, because I really wanted to love this.",30173,2
30174,too small,30174,2
30175,This is a BIG wallet.,30175,2
30175,After 6 months started to come apart at the seam's.,30175,2
30175,It looks amazing tho.,30175,2
30176,extremely small.,30176,2
30176,.,30176,2
30176,I ordered the Large and it was still too small.,30176,2
30176,I am a 10-12 size regularly..,30176,2
30177,Sizes with chart wrong.,30177,2
30178,not up to other Travelon bags I own.,30178,2
30178,It seems it's made quite cheaply.,30178,2
30179,The cross became disconnected after 2 weeks of use.,30179,2
30180,Way too small on anyone with a rack,30180,2
30181,"I was kind of disappointed with these, but I really didn't read the description closely enough.",30181,2
30181,They are completely seamless and sort of look like pajama botttoms.,30181,2
30181,I was looking for something a little more substantial.,30181,2
30182,XLG sizing was not even close...it was more like a medium with very tight fitting arms and chest.,30182,2
30183,"The arms are way too tight, as if it was for a junior with really skinny arms =(
Other than that the shirt is flowy and very nice",30183,2
30184,Wish it was larger,30184,2
30185,"The material is very soft and stretchy, which is nice.",30185,2
30185,"These would be so comfortable, except they are just too short on someone like me with a lot of booty!",30185,2
30186,"These are great, if you only want to wear each pair once.",30186,2
30186,"Pretty poor quality as each pair, after ONE wearing has holes in it...",30186,2
30187,This dress was truly beautiful!,30187,2
30187,"The fabric is soft, modest length, and well made; however, I had to return the dress.",30187,2
30187,I'm a size 22 but this dress was very tight in my waist.,30187,2
30187,Everywhere else fit nicely.,30187,2
30187,I would've tried to lose weight just so I could keep the dress but it comes with chest padding which is unnecessary for my size.,30187,2
30188,very bad cloth quality.,30188,2
30189,This costume was way too big.,30189,2
30189,I typically wear a 3 in women's and I ordered a small (it doesn't come in XS).,30189,2
30189,The costume was too baggy andI couldn't even wear it.,30189,2
30189,I had to return it.,30189,2
30190,It's very cute but it ripped easily when I wore it to work,30190,2
30191,Things shrunk up horribly after a few washes.,30191,2
30191,Disappointing.,30191,2
30192,"I loved the vibrant color, but the dress was slightly large and it puckers at the neck line.",30192,2
30192,The lining then rolls out to the front.,30192,2
30192,:-/,30192,2
30193,too big and not a great quality.,30193,2
30193,It was inexpensive so I should of known,30193,2
30194,Runs very small.,30194,2
30195,When the skirt is on the under slip of gray can be seen thru the tulle.,30195,2
30195,"Which would be okay if it didn't
Have a four inch strip around the middle that is clearly visible thru the two outer layers of tulle.",30195,2
30196,"I received these suits for me and a friend they were super cute, but there is no way an XL is an XL in the USA.",30196,2
30196,it was more like a medium if you're lucky!,30196,2
30196,Though I was very pleased with the seller who refunded my money promptly and without issue.,30196,2
30196,"The suit itself is beyond adorable and the fabric is very quality, just no where near true to the size stated.",30196,2
30197,"Thank goodness this was so cheap, I don't think it would fit a 10yo.",30197,2
30197,Loved that the bottoms hooked like a bra but it doesn't do me much good when they don't fit and I ordered the largest size they offer.,30197,2
30197,FYI I wear a 4-6 in US sizes so I would think that an XL should fit me.,30197,2
30198,I bought 2 of these in Large.,30198,2
30198,They say it fits an 18/20.,30198,2
30198,It does not.,30198,2
30198,"My daughter wears a size 8 and they fit her, I wear a size 18 and it was ridiculously small.",30198,2
30199,Chain was made very thin it broke off my neck the same day I got it,30199,2
30200,Too large....cute but too but too big.,30200,2
30200,Bought a size 21 for my toddler who wears a 5 1/2 and it was too big...,30200,2
30201,"Super comfortable, but used it for 3 weeks and started to see holes similar to the kind you get in leggings.",30201,2
30201,Not durable,30201,2
30202,The tie is narrow; not a traditional size width.,30202,2
30202,"The color is actually cream and black, not white and black as pictured.",30202,2
30203,The inside wasn't glued good...some wires are showing....the on and off buttons located right by the ankle bone which keep turnig the light on and off in irritating way....the charging pc keep coming al the way out...am not very happy with this purchase,30203,2
30204,Need to be a little larger.,30204,2
30205,Cheap fabric.,30205,2
30205,Small fit.,30205,2
30205,Not what I was hoping for,30205,2
30206,Nice design but fit too tight.. Best for slimmer torsos,30206,2
30207,Way too small.,30207,2
30207,Ordered XL like always and the nightgown doesn't fit!,30207,2
30208,Very hard to get cards out.,30208,2
30208,Their is no clear pocket to show your drivers license.,30208,2
30209,My son is now 3 and the 2t pants are still too large.,30209,2
30209,"The shirt fit, and shrunk after a few washes.so the shirt has been trashed, meanwhile we'll waiting for the pants to fit",30209,2
30210,"I have a pair of these that are allegedly the same size, but these ones are at least a full size bigger.",30210,2
30210,"Obnoxious that the sizes have changed so much, especially for someone with very small feet.",30210,2
30210,I have enough trouble finding shoes that fit without dealing with insane variations in actual sizes.,30210,2
30211,The sizes are NOT meant for American women.,30211,2
30211,This product is better received on the continent of Asia and the nearby Islands.,30211,2
30211,I think that 28% of the US Female population will enjoy these sizes since they fit the petite profiles of the sizes.,30211,2
30211,"The shirt I received was labeled XXL and it is a small if bought at Kohl's, Nordstroms or Macy's",30211,2
30212,I ordered my first overall (size 10) and was pretty disappointed when it came after like 2 weeks and it was way too small.,30212,2
30212,I requested a return and the seller sent me a free one in size 14.,30212,2
30212,The sizes are not like on the size chart by the way!,30212,2
30212,This one fits pretty well even though it's still tight even though I usually wear size 10.,30212,2
30212,It's cute but it's obviously cheaply produced and the buttons didn't fit into the holes.,30212,2
30212,I'm disappointed.,30212,2
30213,Pretty but it broke the first time that I wore it and I didn't do anything out of the ordinary that would break it.,30213,2
30214,Was very excited to get this for my niece.,30214,2
30214,Unfortunately it's not easy to change the pendants around.,30214,2
30214,The clasp broke on the first day.,30214,2
30214,Fortunately we were able to fix it and she just wears all of them at the same time.,30214,2
30215,Sizing runs on the small side.,30215,2
30216,The light doesnt work,30216,2
30217,The green color is way lighter the green in the photo.,30217,2
30217,More like a yellow-green color.,30217,2
30217,The fabric is also really flimsy and doesn't hold your breast well especially if your a 32DD like myself.,30217,2
30218,IT NOT WELL MADE WONT ORDER ANY MORE,30218,2
30219,Picture is blurry and not what I expected,30219,2
30220,This is not the quality I would expect from Mud Pie.,30220,2
30220,The material is very thin and flimsy.,30220,2
30220,"My 4 month old is very petite, but this is tight on her legs, but very loose on top and falls off her shoulders.",30220,2
30221,DO NOT GET WHITE!,30221,2
30221,It was so see through!,30221,2
30221,You can see the color of my areolas & nipples!,30221,2
30221,"I'm 5'2"" and 150 pounds...",30221,2
30221,I ordered the Large.,30221,2
30221,Sizing was was...,30221,2
30221,But i will be returning!,30221,2
30221,Also the material is thin and cheap.,30221,2
30221,You get what you pay for.,30221,2
30221,The material is not thick enough for the high waist to suck in my baby belly flab.,30221,2
30221,Will return.,30221,2
30222,Doesn't fit well at all,30222,2
30223,"The T-shirt is nice, but the size that I requested is Large, this in particular came too small",30223,2
30224,WAY smaller than advertised.,30224,2
30225,Not real happy with this purchase.,30225,2
30225,Thank goodness I went for a pair that was deeply discounted ($15).,30225,2
30225,"They're not long enough, ride up and do little to nothing to prevent chaffing while running.",30225,2
30226,STUNK SO BAD WHEN I GOT IT!,30226,2
30226,TOOK WAY TO LONG TO RECEIVE.,30226,2
30227,I really like the way this watch looks (although the face is a little bigger than I had expected).,30227,2
30227,"However, the watch is not water resistant AT ALL.",30227,2
30227,"If I wash my hands with the watch on, it fills up with water droplets and I can't read the time for about 24 hours.",30227,2
30227,"Not sure if there is something wrong with the seal on my particular watch or whether the other reviewers are just more dainty when washing their hands, but it is pretty useless as a watch for me.",30227,2
30228,Ok,30228,2
30229,"It was alright, but it didn't fit.",30229,2
30230,"I measured myself and ordered according to the measurements: product too small for what I ordered, I suggest that consumers be forewarned that this product fits on the small size, even if it is a large or extra large.",30230,2
30231,"Nice looking hat, but way too small for an adult, I gave it to my 16 year daughter.",30231,2
30232,This item is very poor in the quality,30232,2
30233,Itchy at my wrist.,30233,2
30233,I had to return them.,30233,2
30234,Turned my neck green.,30234,2
30235,Very cheaply made and cheap looking.,30235,2
30235,Don't waste your money.,30235,2
30235,"Two rings broke the moment I put them on, and they were not tight or anything.",30235,2
30236,Quality seems to be there but the description is lacking.,30236,2
30236,The band is close to 30mm wide in case you were wondering.,30236,2
30237,looked more pink in the picture and it was more tan and light brown,30237,2
30238,Eh,30238,2
30239,"Waaay to small, giving it to my daughter, she wears a size 0",30239,2
30240,Bought these as the reviews for the minion goggles that came with costume we bought did not have great reviews.,30240,2
30240,These were actually worse then the ones that came with the costume.,30240,2
30240,Fit really small!!!,30240,2
30240,Did not fit the face of my 7 year old.,30240,2
30240,There was no Nose Piece on these which made them snug and very uncomfortable.,30240,2
30241,The material is not good.,30241,2
30241,And cloth got bubbles all over after first wash itself.,30241,2
30242,size chart is off,30242,2
30243,"While the quality of these seems to be pretty good for the price; when I got my package today it had the black, gold and 2 of the aurora colored rings.",30243,2
30243,I mainly wanted the silver one!,30243,2
30243,:(,30243,2
30244,The only time I use these is when I have to go grocery shopping and want to listen to a little music or take a phone call while in the store.,30244,2
30244,"The fit of these are substandard, the volume is low on EVERY device I use...",30244,2
30244,EVEN when I'm using Android L and Viper4Android and/or Dolby Atmos.,30244,2
30244,"If you can't get a good sound out of headphones using those two apps, then your headphones are worthless.",30244,2
30244,"Yes, I'm an Audiophile, and I'd never compare these to my CIEM's, but good grief.",30244,2
30245,LOVE IT BUT THE SIZE CAME TO SMALL,30245,2
30246,Skirt was way too small.,30246,2
30246,Not even close.,30246,2
30246,Had to return it,30246,2
30247,This vest was very cheaply made.,30247,2
30247,"The material is low quality in both look and feel, and wrinkles very easily.",30247,2
30247,"In addition, the buttons were barely sewed on.",30247,2
30247,"Two buttons came off when the vest arrived and was tried on (and it was too big, so hate to think what might happen is stress had been put on them because of a tight fit).",30247,2
30247,"Overall, I wish I had not bothered buying this vest.",30247,2
30248,Was disappointed.,30248,2
30248,Had to glue one of them back together.,30248,2
30248,Glad I didn't pay much for them.,30248,2
30249,poor fit.,30249,2
30249,Too small ended up giving away,30249,2
30250,"Very beautiful material and concept but poor executiion, although I ordered a small/medium, it was HUGE and shapeless which is so sad because it could have been really lovely.",30250,2
30250,I don't know how the model could have looked like that in this top unless it was heavily pinned back or photoshopped.,30250,2
30250,It is really really big.,30250,2
30250,So that's it.,30250,2
30250,"I am usually a small or medium in tops, hence that is why I picked the size I did,  In reality, it is at least a ""large"" and more like and ""extra large"".",30250,2
30250,"If you are tiny, don't bother.",30250,2
30250,"If you want it to look like it does on the model, don't bother.",30250,2
30250,"Too bad, could have been adorable.",30250,2
30250,Not sure what went wrong?,30250,2
30251,"these have got to be Korean sizes, because it was tiny when it arrived to the dismay of my teenage daughter",30251,2
30252,This Outfit is NOT TRUE TO SIZE!,30252,2
30252,The ARMS and BREAST AREA DOES NOT FIT!,30252,2
30253,One of the eyes fell off before it could even be worn.,30253,2
30254,Went by the size chart I could swim in it.,30254,2
30254,But its very cute,30254,2
30255,cute dress.,30255,2
30255,color is not what is shown on amazon.,30255,2
30255,color is turqoise but is actually a deep green.,30255,2
30255,mid section is too loose other than that i loved it.,30255,2
30255,i am 115lbs and a S was too big,30255,2
30256,The fit is okay but the material is not the most comfortable.,30256,2
30256,Will not be ordering any more of these.,30256,2
30257,These look good and if you're only going to use them for a prayer or meditation session they should be fine.,30257,2
30257,"However,  I wanted a mala that I could keep on my wrist all the time, including in the shower.",30257,2
30257,These are not for that as the seeds crack and break off.,30257,2
30257,I'm going to send mine back and get something more sturdy.,30257,2
30258,My wife bought this purse but we returned it.,30258,2
30258,The magnetic clasp that holds the top closed is very small and it leaves big gaps on either side of it.,30258,2
30258,My wife felt that it would be very easy for things like a cell phone to fall through one of those gaps if she put her purse down on it's side or if it fell over.,30258,2
30258,"She liked the fabric and design on the purse, but didn't think it would be worth taking the chance on losing things.",30258,2
30259,Way too small!,30259,2
30259,"I'm 5'7"" and typically wear a size 6 or 8.",30259,2
30259,"I figured the medium would fit, since I typically buy my leggings from Target and Kohls and the medium fits fine.",30259,2
30259,But these are pretty small!,30259,2
30259,I could barely pull them up!,30259,2
30259,Def go a size up!!!,30259,2
30259,"They're pretty cool looking, however, like another reviewer pointed out the cuts on the leggings look like they were made with scissors, no finish to them.",30259,2
30259,"Sadly, I'll be returning these.",30259,2
30260,I liked the look but chain broke after wearing once.,30260,2
30261,To tight in the chest area.,30261,2
30261,Upset a little bought it,30261,2
30262,Not very impressed ..looks ok but flimsy,30262,2
30263,Looked a bit cheap and was way larger than I expected.,30263,2
30264,ok,30264,2
30265,"The pockets are barely adequate to hold the credit cards, they really need to be a quarter inch wider, and the just touching the case leaves fingerprints that are almost impossible to remove.",30265,2
30266,The wallet arrived on time and was in excellent shape.,30266,2
30266,I found it difficult to use as I'm a senior citizen.,30266,2
30266,I returned the wallet.,30266,2
30266,Maybe for the younger generation this would be a great wallet.,30266,2
30267,I did not care for this belt.,30267,2
30267,It was too wide and the leather was too soft.,30267,2
30267,I am returning it.,30267,2
30268,"I ordered these boots because they looked really cute online, i loved the bows in the back.",30268,2
30268,When they arrived i tried them on and they were way too narrow which made me sad!,30268,2
30268,Plus they aren't really good if you have large calves.,30268,2
30268,I would most definitely order these if they again if they had a wider size.,30268,2
30269,"This bag is ok, but it is not pink and black.",30269,2
30269,More like salmon and dark brown,30269,2
30270,Cute but too small for my calfs,30270,2
30271,"Sent measurements; armholes too small, straps bunch up and the waist is sewn crooked.",30271,2
30271,"Really disappointed because it's a pretty dress, lace is really nice.",30271,2
30271,I doubt I can return it.,30271,2
30272,these are not stretchy nor plus size.,30272,2
30272,I'm not huge but if you have thighs they won't go past your knees without looking like they're cutting off your circulation,30272,2
30273,The only positive thing is that it came quicker than expected.,30273,2
30273,"I selected XL but it looks like S, i usually wear a L, next time i will select an XXL or XXXL.",30273,2
30273,Then one of the sleeves came with a hole in it.,30273,2
30273,The other sleeve is tighter.,30273,2
30273,And quality is cheap,30273,2
30274,Was way smaller than the size posted .,30274,2
30274,But it was a beautiful dress.,30274,2
30275,This isn't made at a high quality at all.,30275,2
30275,"It's very cheap, almost to the point of 'unwearable' :(",30275,2
30276,I fell in love with these pants.,30276,2
30276,"They are super comfy but after the first time I washed them, they ripped at the seams and completely fell apart.",30276,2
30277,Nice shirt as far as design but after one wash the color seemed to fade a little in spots.,30277,2
30277,"I love it when Amazon products are optimal, but feel like a fool whenever they're mediocre or second rate.",30277,2
30278,The top os a Large and I am not so sure an extra large would even fit me and I am a 34C.,30278,2
30278,The bottoms are of thin quality fabric and not at all what I would say is a quality fabric or fit for a swimsuit.,30278,2
30279,Material is awful and the fit is really boxy.,30279,2
30279,Gave it to my 12 year old.,30279,2
30280,"Order a size 16 and it was small , I guess I need two size bigger",30280,2
30281,My son wears a 4t and this was cut too small.,30281,2
30281,Shorts are being returned,30281,2
30282,it was broken  when I received it.very unhappy,30282,2
30283,"This bag is super cute, but it is much smaller than described.",30283,2
30283,It smells funny too.,30283,2
30284,"I really wanted to like these, given all the rave reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere.",30284,2
30284,But they're see-through.,30284,2
30284,And after only a couple wears they got a small but noticeable hole in the gusset (aka crotch).,30284,2
30284,"They also don't breathe particularly well, so they get pretty uncomfortable if you're doing anything intense.",30284,2
30284,"All in all, these are not pants I would buy again.",30284,2
30285,Too small for size indicated,30285,2
30286,"Small, pinches and not enough arch support",30286,2
30287,This is not same product as what is displayed when buying it.,30287,2
30287,The arms are much shorter and the fabric is cheap.,30287,2
30287,I wore this once and when I washed it the seams fell apart and ripped.,30287,2
30288,Not even like picture.,30288,2
30288,It's ugly,30288,2
30289,"I really enjoyed the feel of the material but the ""boobs"" ended up  just sitting high on top of my chest.",30289,2
30289,Honestly it looked like a pair of angry eyes.,30289,2
30289,Good for Halloween but I just gave it away to one of my friends.,30289,2
30290,XXL size in real was same as XL :\,30290,2
30291,You get what you pay for!!,30291,2
30291,This is not Silver it is Silver plated.,30291,2
30291,and very cheaply made.,30291,2
30291,the chains were kinked up and I couldn't even undo the clasp felt like I was going to break it.,30291,2
30292,The dress is beautifu but too too large eventhough o ordered for medium.,30292,2
30292,"I am 5'7"" and 135 pounds.",30292,2
30293,Returned didn't fit right,30293,2
30294,"Way too small i,am an L American ordered XL an no way , that is a Medium at most",30294,2
30295,Runs very small,30295,2
30296,"First, the material is just weird.",30296,2
30296,"Very, very synthetic feeling and thick/structured but clingy at the same time.",30296,2
30296,Way longer than what the picture suggests too.,30296,2
30296,"I normally wear an XL/1X and got a XXL in this - it was normal in the shoulders/arms, extremely fitted in the torso, and then the bottom ruffled out almost like a peplum top and was long enough to be a short dress (and I'm 5'7""!)",30296,2
30296,"If this was a flowy top that actually fit like a flowy top, I would have loved it.",30296,2
30296,"The detail in the back is great and the neckline is flattering, but the fit as a whole just doesn't work.",30296,2
30297,It is roes gold not gold.,30297,2
30297,Not the same color in the picture.,30297,2
30298,I  usually wear a US 8-10.,30298,2
30298,Took this item in Large.,30298,2
30298,"Although this jacket fits....it's too short....pockets ate too high up....lol

Will give away to my sister who is shorter....nice colour though",30298,2
30299,They broke I didn't even get to wear them!,30299,2
30300,This is one very solid tool.,30300,2
30300,"However, I bought it to remove the back of a very slim men's dress watch, and it's blade is clumsily thick.",30300,2
30300,No chance of it working on fine men's or small lady's watches.,30300,2
30300,Will have to keep looking.,30300,2
30300,"If you want to remove easily removed covers, this, or a screwdriver would work well.",30300,2
30300,Not for thin watches.,30300,2
30301,couldn't breath in the chest area.,30301,2
30301,other than that it was pretty perfect.,30301,2
30301,go a size up for sure.,30301,2
30302,I did a previous review.,30302,2
30302,"The shirt is very small, and does not fit like the picture at all.",30302,2
30302,"I did contact the seller, and they were accommodating and did what they could to help me.",30302,2
30302,I do appreciate that.,30302,2
30302,Wish the shirt was bigger.,30302,2
30303,****** Update ******* 7/14/16 - I've been using the red one for a month and wrist strap just broke.,30303,2
30303,:( I am sad that it only lasted a month and its now to late to return it.,30303,2
30303,I will definitely not purchase any more of these.,30303,2
30303,I bought 2 of these (red and black) and love them.,30303,2
30303,"I can fit all of the my cards, checkbook, and my Iphone 6 plus with room to go.",30303,2
30303,The wrist strap is sturdy and the zipper is easy.,30303,2
30303,I would definitely recommend these.,30303,2
30304,The only saving grace was that it fit my daughter perfectly.,30304,2
30305,I am very dissatisficed.,30305,2
30305,The dress is too different that i showed!,30305,2

30306,This hat is large knit and doubled up.,30306,2
30306,You can pull it inside out and have a deflated pillow.,30306,2
30306,Very strange.,30306,2
30306,stretches out very quickly.,30306,2
30307,"not only did it not fit right, it just looked like it hung there",30307,2
30308,Absolutely the most ridiculous dress I have ever bought.,30308,2
30308,"Stupidly I did not read the reviews before purchasing, had I, I would not have bought this.",30308,2
30308,"First off there is NO ZIPPER, I could barely get the dress on over my shoulders because the waist is so fitted.",30308,2
30308,"Then there is a loose flap that is supposed to cover your back and rearend behind the lace-up back, but there is nothing to hold it in place so you better hope it doesn't slide or you will be showing everyone your goods.",30308,2
30308,"Once the dress was on, and finally tightened up enough and tied, it looked really nice (minus the huge bow because the strings are so long).",30308,2
30308,But then it was just as hard to get back off.,30308,2
30308,"If I were you I would save your money, unless you have someone who can alter it to put in a zipper and hooks for the flap.",30308,2
30309,Good,30309,2
30310,Very poorly made and cheap looking.,30310,2
30311,Way too small did not match the size chart,30311,2
30312,"Normally I buy a medium, but I went for a large it and it was really small.",30312,2
30312,"So small, that I didn't feel comfortable wearing it.",30312,2
30312,Sizing like this is not only inaccurate but also makes women feel bad about their bodies.,30312,2
30313,Got to order like 2 sizes up,30313,2
30314,Bracelet is cute as a bangle even though it's a more oval shape it doesn't hold reg hair ties only the thin ones and I have thick hair so its basically useless.,30314,2
30315,One star for on time arrival.,30315,2
30315,One star for the fact that product was specified length and color.,30315,2
30315,"The chain smelled like diesel fuel, and was very greasy.",30315,2
30315,I rinsed them in a mild soap.,30315,2
30315,Not a good idea!,30315,2
30315,Now the chain is rusty!,30315,2
30315,I guess you get what you pay for.,30315,2
30316,These were completely saturated with water from the snow after a very short time.,30316,2
30316,"The white top ""fabric"" part is not waterproof and also not washable.",30316,2
30316,It turned dingy in one wear.,30316,2
30317,Smaller than I was expecting and no sparkle.,30317,2
30317,I returned.,30317,2
30318,It's cute but not very good quality.,30318,2
30319,This dress was rather cheap looking and was not long like picture.,30319,2
30319,"Ordered Medium,  I'm 5.5"" around (avg., frame_ waist 26/27""_ round derriere), 130lbs.",30319,2
30320,Cheaply made and the lips aren't as purple like the picture.,30320,2
30321,"Top didn't fit right, almost like it was backwards.",30321,2
30321,The style is not as pictured.,30321,2
30321,Bottoms are cute however.,30321,2
30322,It's not as cute in person!,30322,2
30323,My daughter was devastated when she saw this dress.,30323,2
30323,The top was too tight and the bottom was way too big.,30323,2
30323,We have sent it back.,30323,2
30324,Very weird fit.,30324,2
30324,Haven't figured out how to wear it so that it doesn't look awkward.,30324,2
30324,"The front looks as pictured, but the back looks sort of like a baggy t shirt and seems wrong.",30324,2
30325,itchy,30325,2
30326,Not accurate information regarding size,30326,2
30327,Falls out very easy.,30327,2
30327,Gets stuck on hair/clothes,30327,2
30328,I purchased 2 in different colors.,30328,2
30328,"However, I' m not completely happy.",30328,2
30328,They are very itchy even after washing and using fabric softner.,30328,2
30328,One also tore in the armpit area on both sides even with proper fit.,30328,2
30328,"For me,  I also felt they are a little to low cut and required a cami unless that s not what one is looking for.",30328,2
30328,"They are in fact advertised as sexy as the materials and overall product is in and of itself, is stiff.",30328,2
30329,Shipping outrageously slow & kit is cheaply made doesn't look sterile,30329,2
30330,"Doesnt look at all like the pic and one side is not the design it shows, it is 2 solid colors!",30330,2
30331,Not quite what was expected.,30331,2
30331,The sizing is off.,30331,2
30332,"The fit was fine and the color was nice, but I don't like the way it falls.",30332,2
30332,"The pleats stick out on the sides, almost like a triangle which accentuates the hips.",30332,2
30332,"I'll wear this around the house as it is comfortable, but I would go out with it on.",30332,2
30333,It was actually too large and too small.,30333,2
30333,The top was too small and the bottom fits like a large.,30333,2
30333,I ordered a small because I based it on another person's review.,30333,2
30333,"We were about the same height and weight, but I guess we weren't similar enough.",30333,2
30333,I'm 5'0 tall; weigh about 104 pounds; breast size 32C; and hip size fits a small.,30333,2
30333,Another problem were the straps---too long for petite girls.,30333,2
30333,The zippers look like it will rust easily.,30333,2
30333,And the color is not as vibrant as it was advertised.,30333,2
30333,(Just look at other people's pictures.),30333,2
30333,Returned it today.,30333,2
30334,These are sized too small,30334,2
30335,Melts in dryer,30335,2
30336,Diamonds were  not set well.,30336,2
30336,In first 28 days it lost a stone.,30336,2
30336,"While my wife like the size and feel of the ring, the quality was not adequate.",30336,2
30337,The quality was very poor & the tow sunglasses lenses were not the same shape.,30337,2
30337,Although the company gave me a second pair for free but they were still the same quality.,30337,2
30338,This suit doesnt fit well.,30338,2
30338,Buy bigger.,30338,2
30338,"The color portion is not sew in, it is a flap on one side.",30338,2
30338,Found that odd.,30338,2
30338,The crotch doesn't fit well either.,30338,2
30339,"I bought them as a gift and they have no give in the material, so I will have to return them:(",30339,2
30340,"It was nice however , it was cheaply made the chain strap fell off before I left the hotel !",30340,2
30341,the names aren't as legible as it seems to appear  They are very small,30341,2
30342,shoes good but earrings are s***.,30342,2
30343,Barely holds any ashes.,30343,2
30343,Like a speck.,30343,2
30343,"Looks cute, but doesn't serve it's purpose very well.",30343,2
30343,Disappointed :(,30343,2
30344,style,30344,2
30345,Did not expect to be too small if I ordered 2xL....,30345,2
30346,Super cute but the back of the suit there was a little too much spsce,30346,2
30347,I expected the choli to look exactly like what the model's top (mesh with solid white piece)is but what I received was a mesh - like choli with NO solid white piece attached.,30347,2
30347,"This is for a belly dance costume I'm putting together, so now I have to find something else.",30347,2
30348,I returned this dress.,30348,2
30348,"While I like the style, the dress was too snug and the seams had thread spilling out of them.",30348,2
30349,Cheap material.,30349,2
30350,"Design was cute, but to its small and the fabric is terrible.",30350,2
30350,If you have any curves don't bother..,30350,2
30351,"It was cute, but much shorter than it looks in picture.",30351,2
30351,Decent material,30351,2
30352,I really wanted to like this swimsuit and it fit wonderfully from the waist down but the bust area was a mess.,30352,2
30352,I'm 5'5 at about 38-29-42...so essentially curvy.,30352,2
30352,"At a D cup I would have thought I'd have no problems filling out the bust area (I ordered a size 12), but this suit was roomy at the top (even with the extra padding in the bra).",30352,2
30352,I needed a suit for a waterpark so I needed it to be secure with good support for the rides.,30352,2
30352,"Although the high neck gave adequate coverage, the looseness essentially erased the support it might have given had it been a secure fit.",30352,2
30352,This suit is probably great for curvy women with a lot of extra up top...not so much for someone with just an average curvy figure.,30352,2
30353,"They are nice shirts but I received the wrong size, I ordered a 6xl and received a 4xl.",30353,2
30353,They fit but it's a snug fit.,30353,2
30354,"Even after ordering two sizes up, it was still too small.",30354,2
30355,Not what was expected.,30355,2
30355,"For price, kinda not worth it :(",30355,2
30356,Very cool but XL is more like a medium.,30356,2
30357,Did not fit as expected - too small!,30357,2
30358,Too small for a toddler.,30358,2
30359,I got an extra small and it is still too big for me.,30359,2
30359,I normally wear a size 3 and i weigh 120 and am 5'4.,30359,2
30359,The gloves aren't that great either.,30359,2
30359,They are too loose as well.,30359,2
30359,The top part of the costume with the skull fit ok though.,30359,2
30360,This whole thing was an experiment for me.,30360,2
30360,In the winter I tend to wear blend socks that are a bit ticker than my regular cotton ones and thru the day they start to go down.,30360,2
30360,"I am not talking about super thick wool socks, just regular blend socks.",30360,2
30360,"I use pretty much the same dress shoes winter and summer so I cannot wear ""sweater thick"" socks in the winter.",30360,2
30360,I thought I would give these a try.,30360,2
30360,"And here you have ""my learnings"".",30360,2
30360,It may work differently for some one else.,30360,2
30360,"I am giving it two stars for two main reasons:
Number one, I do not think the product was designed to work with men socks.",30360,2
30360,"Maybe it was my fault for not reading some of the reviews, which now, I realize have commented on this issue.",30360,2
30360,The pulls do not work with regular men socks because they are too small; I attempted to use it with 4 different pairs.,30360,2
30360,"In addition, most men socks are mid to upper calves and the pulls are still too short to reach that from the right below the knee part.",30360,2
30360,"I think these will be great if you are wearing ladies below knee stockings or something that thin (I am sure there is a proper name for them, I just do not know.",30360,2
30360,"The are made of stocking material, but they are socks right below the knee.)",30360,2
30360,"Number two, the buckles that close the part that goes around you leg are made of metal.",30360,2
30360,They are super sleek looking; but if you have hairy legs your hairs will be pulled.,30360,2
30360,"I do have to say, the product seems of very good quality, and it is very nice looking; just did not work for me; with my socks, and my hairy legs.",30360,2
30360,I am going to try something called military shirt/socks stays.,30360,2
30360,We shall see how that goes.,30360,2
30361,"It's pretty, but a bit big for a Daith piercing.",30361,2
30362,Not what she wanted - too much ring.,30362,2
30362,Easily returned.,30362,2
30362,Thanks Amazon,30362,2
30363,It came in two pieces and we cannot get it to join together.,30363,2
30363,I am trying one more place to see if we can get the two parts connected.,30363,2
30363,I love the watch face.,30363,2
30364,"Well I just received this not to long ago , a few mins ago to be exact.",30364,2
30364,"I was really excited , fit was off a Lil maybe that was my fault.",30364,2
30364,But by looking closer some of the stitching was falling apart already.,30364,2
30364,The hood that's detachable wouldn't stay on due to improper stitching.,30364,2
30364,Lots of loose strings/threads hanging off .,30364,2
30364,"I feel as tho if I wash it a couple of time something is bond to come off , was very excited to get this today but upon arrival an inspection , I feel as tho I got handed sum jacket that was sloppily put together an not worth the money.",30364,2
30364,If I spend 30 dollars on something a piece of clothing I expect at least the stitching be right.,30364,2
30364,I want to return asap,30364,2
30365,Broke after the third wear,30365,2
30366,I liked it just too small,30366,2
30367,I love the hat but it's just to small,30367,2
30368,This is a nice bag.,30368,2
30368,Very cute.,30368,2
30368,I get a lot of compliments on it.,30368,2
30368,"However, it is cheaply made.",30368,2
30368,"The main zipper is not functioning well for me (sounds like others have had this problem), and it keeps getting worse.",30368,2
30368,The bag is unusable now because it just won't zip.,30368,2
30368,The zipper isn't stuck.,30368,2
30368,It just doesn't zip the two sides together when you pull it; it remains open.,30368,2
30368,Disappointing cause it's a nice (cheap) bag!,30368,2
30368,I am going to contact the seller.,30368,2
30369,I bought these shoes for my husband.,30369,2
30369,"The lace tightener broke the first time he tried to use it, but we didn't return them since he really needed the sandals that day.",30369,2
30369,The rest of the shoes disintegrated within a month of daily use; the soles peeled away from the rest of the shoes.,30369,2
30369,Also they gave him terrible blisters at first and then when they were broken.,30369,2
30369,I would not recommend these sandals.,30369,2
30370,Sizing way off!,30370,2
30371,Really cute but lace is cheap and itchy and scratchy.,30371,2
30371,The white tee that goes underneath looks like a pillowcase with straps.,30371,2
30371,I would not wear this!,30371,2
30372,Sent them back.,30372,2
30372,They were huge on my infant and made of cheap polyester.,30372,2
30373,"It was, OK not really what I expected kind of cheaply made .",30373,2
30373,I'm not sure I'd purchase again.,30373,2
30374,It is a lot larger then a normal wristlet & also the strap was broken.,30374,2
30375,"Not too pleased with product I use them for work and they seem to attract dirt and anything else you make work with such as insulation dust,etc.not easily dusted off like denim they also wrinkle very easily and make them less attractive,I like the fit and comfort,if possibly made from different fabric like denim or similar would be perfect.",30375,2
30376,"cute but it's very short, I'm 5'3"" I got a medium and I'll need to take it in up top and it's too short to wear as is.",30376,2
30376,so it will only work to wear over a swim suit or with leggings or something....cute but I was hoping for a longer just above the knee dress...,30376,2
30377,not what I expected,30377,2
30378,Sleeves are too tight reduced  and the length it's just right,30378,2
30379,"Top was too big around, and too small where your boobs go.",30379,2
30379,Skirt was cute but if you have a little tummy it will round it.,30379,2
30379,"And it is very see through up top, so don't wear under fluorescent lighting haha.",30379,2
30379,Honestly wouldnt have bought if I could've tried it on first.,30379,2
30380,Not  truly white,30380,2
30381,Does not lie well,30381,2
30382,I ordered the size I take and I had to squeeze myself into it.,30382,2
30382,The quality surprised me too; not what I expected.,30382,2
30383,does not run true to size,30383,2
30384,"Reviewed the sizing guidelines and decided to order a size larger to be safe, as it is supposed to be an ""oversized"" sweater.",30384,2
30384,Was a tight fit and also smelled very moldy.,30384,2
30384,Don't think I'll be ordering from this company again.,30384,2
30385,I was so excited to get this bra.,30385,2
30385,I'm pregnant with my third and my regular bras are becoming too small.,30385,2
30385,Usually I'm a 36C so I ordered a large and it was no where near big enough especially for growing breasts while pregnant.,30385,2
30385,This bra is very cute but is too small.,30385,2
30385,Will be returning and continue my search for a bra.,30385,2
30386,Glasses are okay too fake looking but they will do....,30386,2
30387,VERY short and cheaply made,30387,2
30388,I like it.for my turtlenecks.,30388,2
30388,Clean and simple lines,30388,2
30389,So this item looks like it is really long in the photo which is why I bought it.,30389,2
30389,The photo makes it seem like this item goes from just under the bust and ends right above your pubic area which it does not.,30389,2
30389,This also is labeled 2X but there is NO way thats a US size.,30389,2
30389,I only ordered it because so many other people said it was really small and since I am a US M-L I figured it might work.,30389,2
30389,The compression is fine but its not long like in the photos so you either get a muffin top or the bottom of your stomach sticks out.,30389,2
30390,Shirt was to small and 5% of a refuned wasn't worth it...,30390,2
30390,I spent more for the shirt and to get like 1 or 2$ back.. Nope.. Be more discriptive on the sizing look like they run in asian size.,30390,2
30390,v.v,30390,2
30391,Squeezes your package too much.,30391,2
30391,"I have a 30"" waist and purchased the largest one.",30391,2
30391,Still too small.,30391,2
30391,Price is great though.,30391,2
30392,Fitting in the wrong places not as flattering as expected.,30392,2
30393,Top is great!,30393,2

30393,"They are not things, but are not far from it!",30393,2
30393,Can't be worn by my 14 year old daughter!,30393,2
30394,Really bad smell when it arrives but comes out after a wash or two.,30394,2
30394,Strings constantly fall out during each wash.  After a few washes it is basically ruined.,30394,2
30394,Expect better quality for the price.,30394,2
30395,I ordered Medium which is right.,30395,2
30395,"However, because the fabrics is very thick, which makes the swing skirt very wide and volume.",30395,2
30395,It's not flattery.,30395,2
30395,"My body shape is ""hour-glass"".",30395,2
30395,But this dress makes me look like have a big waist.,30395,2
30395,"Again, total look is no good from waist down.",30395,2
30395,Returned it.,30395,2
30396,"The necklace is pretty, but the one string is longer than the other and the way it came in the plastic was folded up and its all twisted and creased up.",30396,2
30396,"I think it will be fine , but still cute",30396,2
30397,Pretty cheap stuff.,30397,2
30397,"When I got it, one of the screws was already missing, so it basically was DOA.",30397,2
30398,I went by the size chart and it is too small on the top\Not happy,30398,2
30399,didn't like material plus it was to big,30399,2
30400,"Material is very cheap, but looks like picture!",30400,2
30401,"Not a Rosary, cheap elastic band.",30401,2
30401,Not at all what I expected,30401,2
30402,"Cheap material, not a ski jacket.",30402,2
30402,And runs way too small.,30402,2
30402,Very stiff material,30402,2
30403,After trying the shoes on & the lights.,30403,2
30403,The lights stop working,30403,2
30404,The jacket appeared to be heavier than it is.,30404,2
30404,It also ran very high waisted.,30404,2
30404,The buttons are chintzy looking.,30404,2
30404,Not what I expected at all.,30404,2
30405,The round portion is too big.,30405,2
30405,It almost covers my upto my eyes.,30405,2
30405,The material used is bit cheap.,30405,2
30405,Doesnt matter it is just for few minutes/ hours for a birthday party.,30405,2
30405,And thats me whose head is barely seen.,30405,2
30405,Hahahah,30405,2
30406,ordered wrong size,30406,2
30407,Material  cheap & too small h sleeves tight,30407,2
30408,It was wayyyy to long and the sleeves were super wide.,30408,2
30409,"The wings only have one pin so they can't stay pointed in a direction, they just hang limp.",30409,2
30409,It's pretty disappointing but I guess that is what you get for less than 10 dollars.,30409,2
30409,Just be warned.,30409,2
30410,The top is not like the pic,30410,2
30411,Turns my finger green,30411,2
30412,I never wore it.,30412,2
30412,Has this HUGE collar and the collar has a seam like it was seen inside out.,30412,2
30413,The color/style/and fabric was awesome but I went exactly with the size chart to the size of my body and it was wayyyyyy too small.,30413,2
30414,"I would not stick good to phone and always had air bubbles, and when I tried to put my hard case to protect my phone it took the screen protector off more",30414,2
30415,Looks pretty yet of lower quality product for the price :(,30415,2
30416,"Don't waste your money unless you need a cheap, extremely temporary replacement bag (like I unfortunately did).",30416,2
30416,"I carried this bag on once, then brought it on another trip where I was forced to check it at the gate.",30416,2
30416,One of the wheels was crushed in and now the suitcase does not roll properly.,30416,2
30416,What a waste of cash.,30416,2
30417,I love the look of this bag.,30417,2
30417,"It is roomy and comfortable to carry  however it is already flaking, the brown outer layer is rubbing off.",30417,2
30417,Very disappointed.,30417,2
30418,The XL was a bit small,30418,2
30419,"Loved the photo but the material wasn't what I had hoped it was too ""dressy"" but also cheap looking as it came all wrinkled etc.",30419,2
30419,I wanted more of a maxi dress look and the material was more like a formal cheap dress.,30419,2
30419,Maybe if it was steamed it would look nicer.,30419,2
30419,Also just was too small I think the fit is best on a thin body with smaller breasts.,30419,2
30419,"I'm a size 6/8 5'6"" and breast 36D",30419,2
30420,Belt was missing,30420,2
30421,I was disappointed with the masks.,30421,2
30421,Some of them were not cut out as even as I would have liked.,30421,2
30421,Not worth the price especially after you add the S&H.,30421,2
30422,Quality was good but it was too big,30422,2
30423,The XL could fit like a standard Medium - if you don't want to be comfortable in it.,30423,2
30423,Returning.,30423,2
30423,"Not worth it - this should feel comfortable, not constricting - at this sizing.",30423,2
30423,Total waste.,30423,2
30424,"The top was as seen in the picture, but the bottoms were not cheeky or brazillian at all.",30424,2
30424,Shipping was faster than expected.,30424,2
30425,It's a beautiful dress but was too small around my chest.,30425,2
30425,I really wish it would have fit better.,30425,2
30426,Item almost resembled a child's toy necklace,30426,2
30427,Fit okay but extremely short!,30427,2
30428,"Colors and material are fine, I could have worked with it but the torso was way too short, it gave me a cameltoe.",30428,2
30428,"and i'm not a tall person, i'm  5'2.",30428,2
30428,meh.,30428,2
30429,color wasn't even close.,30429,2
30429,:(,30429,2
30430,these shirts run super smal...!,30430,2
30430,be careful.,30430,2
30430,i told my friends to just keep scrolling if they see them.,30430,2
30431,The top was huge and the bottom was itty bitty,30431,2
30432,The color is not as pictured.,30432,2
30432,It's also very seethru.,30432,2
30433,The is not something to wear if you want to get in the water.,30433,2
30433,This is only for show and the material is very thin.,30433,2
30433,The top is just a piece of cheap fabric (material) sad but  I would NOT recommend.,30433,2
30434,Cheap.,30434,2
30434,See through,30434,2
30435,Too small.,30435,2
30435,Low quality.,30435,2
30436,"covered half of my boob, in the photo it looked like the baithing suit had great coverage... No... not at all...",30436,2
30437,This dress was too small.,30437,2
30437,I think it was a junior size.,30437,2
30437,Disappointed!,30437,2
30438,Very very thin.,30438,2
30439,Too tight in the calf,30439,2
30440,The xxl fit ok but it was too tight for a big belly,30440,2
30441,they went a little bet past,30441,2
30442,These were too small and the padding is comepletely different from the ones I bought in store.,30442,2
30442,the padding was very stiff.,30442,2
30442,I returned these and received a refund.,30442,2
30443,"I am 5'7'', size XS/0, waist 25 and ordered the skirt in size S.

Fit and color: The fit is way off, huge in the waist (fits like 27'' waist), the slit in the back comes up way too high making the skirt look inappropriate.",30443,2
30443,The color is as pictured but the pattern does not align at seams.,30443,2
30443,The latter may not be an issue for some but I think it looks cheap.,30443,2
30443,The material is not of very high quality either.,30443,2
30443,Summary: Returning this skirt due to odd fit and low quality.,30443,2
30444,"Not just one size too small
I would say two sizes too small, I ordered a size up because it said it ran small but I would have had to order two sizes up",30444,2
30445,Not true to size and belt was very thin,30445,2
30446,These were too short and a little small compared to the same sizing in some of the brand's other clothing options.,30446,2
30446,The seaming was poor and some of the threads snapped just stretching them out before trying on.,30446,2
30447,looked more like a dog than cat,30447,2
30448,Too tight for some reason,30448,2
30449,Didn't fit at all - way too small,30449,2
30450,Color is more copper than it should be and looks YELLOW gold in most light.,30450,2
30450,"Aside from the unfortunate color, integrity of the material and plating seems high.",30450,2
30451,"Very pretty, thin and lightweight.",30451,2
30451,I think I would've loved it if the clasp hadn't broken 15 minutes after I put it on.,30451,2
30452,The lace started to come apart the first time I washed it.,30452,2
30453,Color was grt  but to small,30453,2
30454,I need a refund,30454,2
30455,Sizing chart does not give good representation of actual fit.,30455,2
30455,"I am usually a medium and I originally ordered a large as some people said it ran small, had to return for an xl and THAT still feels too snug.",30455,2
30456,Pretty dress but 3sizes to big,30456,2
30457,not  as  advertise,30457,2
30458,I buy 2xl so that it will be loose on me and not form fitting.,30458,2
30458,This was form fitting in that size.,30458,2
30459,I'm normally a size medium but had to order a XXL and it's still a bit to small.,30459,2
30459,The look of the vest is great but don't understand why their XXL is almost a medium size.,30459,2
30459,I hate to see what a their medium size fits.,30459,2
30459,A 5 foot child ?,30459,2
30459,LOL  I'm 5foot 8in 160 pounds 32 inch waist and a XXL is a Little tight.,30459,2
30459,I wish the made an XXXL.,30459,2
30459,Or better yet.,30459,2
30459,Sizes that actually fit people.,30459,2
30459,I wish I could get my money back,30459,2
30460,Very unflattering.,30460,2
30460,"Great idea, but it was way too large and ended up being very frumpy looking.",30460,2
30461,Kind of small on my head,30461,2
30462,These shoes did not last a whole month.,30462,2
30462,I bought them bigger so he wasn't able to wear them until mid oct.  and it's now almost thanksgiving.,30462,2
30462,"They are cute shoes, I'll give them that!",30462,2
30462,Little guy loved them but just didn't last as the glue holding the sole and leather together didn't hold up.,30462,2
30463,Small and no good quality,30463,2
30464,"Quality is fine, but the leather color is not complementary to the beads.",30464,2
30464,"Also the the ""simulated jasper"" look more like cheap plastic...I had to return it.",30464,2
30465,"I'm 5'9, 150.",30465,2
30465,Typically wear a large.,30465,2
30465,"This was not only too small, but way too short after ordering 2 sizes up.",30465,2
30465,Even if I were a size small I think this would still be a belly shirt on me!,30465,2
30465,I'd recommend for the petite and small only.,30465,2
30466,"The boots are absolutely gorgeous; but after a couple of hours of wearing them, the bow is hanging on one of the boots.",30466,2
30467,"It's pretty, but very bendy.",30467,2
30467,"I bent it to make sure it'd open up enough to gift to my mother in law & it did bend open, but I felt like it could break in half if I bent it too much farther",30467,2
30468,Bigger than expected,30468,2
30469,Ordered brown and they fit.,30469,2
30469,Ordered green and they are too small.,30469,2
30470,smaller on the inside do not like it,30470,2
30471,Kind of cheap material.,30471,2
30471,My daughter is 5 foot 2 inches and is 105 pounds (17 years old).,30471,2
30471,I ordered this for halloween one year and she hasn't worn it since.,30471,2
30471,There's no zipper on the dress so its difficult to get the waist part past your bust when pulling it over your head and its even especially harder when trying to take it off.,30471,2
30471,"Although her measurements suggested between a Small and Medium, we got her a Large and it was still relatively small and she is not a big girl.",30471,2
30472,"While the wig itself seems pretty good quality for the price, it is just too small for an adult.",30472,2
30472,"I read some reviews that it was small, but I wear a small hat/helmet for sports and thought I would be fine.",30472,2
30472,"But, I was wrong.",30472,2
30472,It's just a bit too small for me.,30472,2
30472,I will be returning it and looking elsewhere.,30472,2
30473,For one size fits all...that maybe a stretch.,30473,2
30473,My daughter wears a size 9 and it fits her perfectly...but the material ripped at the seam near the calf.,30473,2
30473,For anyone larger it may fit them tightly.,30473,2
30473,"Also, the smell from the packaging and material is terrible.",30473,2
30473,I washed the item 5 times and also hand washed and soaked the leggings but the smell still sticks within the fiber.,30473,2
30473,Positive note:  the color was pretty.,30473,2
30474,Got the S-M Size and was very exited to wear it until I discovered it runs bigger than expected so it does not offer much support.,30474,2
30474,The material seems to be good  but can't tell for sure.,30474,2
30474,Will update my review later.,30474,2
30475,Ordered these in Dec 2016.,30475,2
30475,Generally they are ok for the price.,30475,2
30475,"The other reviewers are correct, they are smaller than your normal aviator-type glasses.",30475,2
30475,"But not child size, just smaller--good for a narrow-faced man or a woman.",30475,2
30475,"I found two major issues with them:

1) They are clearly used / refurbished.",30475,2
30475,This was not represented in the product description which is highly disappointing.,30475,2
30475,"2) The stickers applied to the lenses (which are meant to make the product look new, but clearly are not original Callaway stickers) are not only not the original stickers, but they are THE WORST stickers you could put on lenses - you pull them off and they leave not only a sticky residue, but also the paper from the sticker!",30475,2
30475,Really poor choice here.,30475,2
30476,"Although the product description said this case would fit 100's, it did not.",30476,2
30476,So I will be returning the case.,30476,2
30477,Soft fabric but not even close to preemie size.,30477,2
30477,Waste of my money.,30477,2
30477,My daughter (5lbs) won't fit these for months.,30477,2
30478,The chain broke without any abuse.,30478,2
30478,It just fell apart.,30478,2
30479,Came with a hole in the seem over a inch long and smelled of smoke.,30479,2
30480,Felt it very difficult to put on.....not user friendly...had a friend try it as well and it doesn't stay on.,30480,2
30481,I should have read the previous reviews.,30481,2
30481,It broke at the thin metal plate just like others have described.,30481,2
30482,"It is ""One Size"" as described but that size is LARGE, maybe extra extra large.",30482,2
30482,"I have always had to adjust my caps all the way out, bicycle and motorcycle helmets are always large.",30482,2
30482,This hat slides down to my ears.,30482,2
30482,"The quality seems nice though,There is a black liner under the brim that extends out to the edges as you can see in the photo.",30482,2
30482,No liner in the crown (the top part of the hat).,30482,2
30482,The upside is that I get sunburned easily.,30482,2
30482,"This hat should keep the sun off of my head, ears, neck, face,,,, back...feet....",30482,2
30483,Pants material really thin.,30483,2
30483,The shirt is shorter then in picture.,30483,2
30483,Disappointed.,30483,2
30484,I went by the chart and it's kind of small and then it smashes the assets I do have instead of bringing them out,30484,2
30485,After a few washes this doesn't look all that good.,30485,2
30486,Way too small,30486,2
30487,"The leggings are fine, but they are this stretchy synthetic material that is not soft or breathable making it unsuitable for summer.",30487,2
30488,Not at all what I was hoping for.,30488,2
30488,Too small and not at all comfortable to wear.,30488,2
30488,Returned them.,30488,2
30489,one of the eyelets has already came out,30489,2
30490,Way to small for the average person to fit it correctly,30490,2
30491,"I usually wear a size M shirt, but when I checked the measurement chart for this one, it said I was an XL.",30491,2
30491,"I figured, OK, maybe it's jr sizing or something?",30491,2
30491,"But no, it is WAAAYYY too big.",30491,2
30491,"I should have just gone with a M and ignored the size chart, apparently.",30491,2
30491,The shirt material feels cheap and it also isn't as long as it appears in the photo.,30491,2
30492,This dress is made for very petite women.,30492,2
30492,The fabric was not amazing and had a ton of static which made it stick to my legs.,30492,2
30492,"Overall, it was cute but not very high quality.",30492,2
30493,Before you make a purchase look up Columbia Mens Windward III Overshirt.,30493,2
30493,"Columbia makes a far superior shirt when it comes to durability, comfort, fit, warmth....",30493,2
30493,This shirt fit large and far from flattering,30493,2
30494,This shirt has several rust stains from the pins used to fold the shirt.,30494,2
30494,These stains did not come out when in the wash.,30494,2
30495,The top was adorable but the bottoms were huge!,30495,2
30495,returned package,30495,2
30496,To small to fit cards,30496,2
30497,So see through I can't even wear it,30497,2
30498,"The color is not as vibrant as the photo and it was bigger and more ""matronly"" than I expected.",30498,2
30498,I am not sure I will continue to wear it.,30498,2
30499,"While this was very cute and did not irritate my skin at all, two of the stones fell out after a week of wear and the entire wheel fell off after two weeks.",30499,2
30499,I had to super glue it back on.,30499,2
30500,Arrived broken although it can be fixed with super glue.,30500,2
30500,You get what you pay for.,30500,2
30500,We'll see how long it lasts....,30500,2
30501,material is very cheap!,30501,2
30502,I am on the fence about this shirt.,30502,2
30502,I have not worn it yet because it seems to fit just weird.,30502,2
30502,"All I can describe is a ""weird"" fit.",30502,2
30502,The colors are vibrant and the shirt is pretty.,30502,2
30502,I also did not check the material it was made out of but it feels a bit heavier than it looks but I do like the material.,30502,2
30503,FRAGILE,30503,2
30504,Cheap knock off's - Laces literally broke in 2 days.,30504,2
30504,Had to replace and seem to be holding up ok. 6 year olds are very hard on shoes but expect that they will last atleast 2-3 months.,30504,2
30505,"Not the hottest product, but for some reason I want to try it again.",30505,2
30506,The picture makes this product appear differently than what actually arrives.,30506,2
30506,The fabric is extremely lightweight - almost sheer.,30506,2
30506,It is a tighter fit than the size indicates.,30506,2
30507,Nice material but way to small I'm normally a large but ordered an extra large giving it room to be smaller but this is Barbie clothes small .,30507,2
30508,Sizes are wrong - fit is not as described.,30508,2
30509,"Bought according to size chart, but was about a size and a half too small.",30509,2
30509,Since it was a last minute purchase my son wore it open with a t-shirt underneath.,30509,2
30510,This is meant for a size 28-32 A...ONLY!!,30510,2
30510,The concept is adorable.,30510,2
30510,Material soft.,30510,2
30511,Really cute...one arrived broken.,30511,2
30512,Bought this for my daughter she loved it until her first time in the water with the suit and the underwire started rusting and she had lots of rust spots all over the top..so we returned the suit,30512,2
30513,CHEAP MATERIAL.,30513,2
30513,NO BUTTON HOLE.,30513,2
30513,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,30513,2
30514,You get what u pay for.,30514,2
30514,Poor quality.,30514,2
30514,The texture and look is horrible... the material falls out when trying to comb it out.,30514,2
30514,Waste of money.,30514,2
30515,I got it because the reviews were so good but sitting in it I feel like i'm going to break it.,30515,2
30515,"It is super soft so I give it that but the arms/sleeves are 2 different colors and the left one is way bigger than the right.and the legs are really short or the crotch is really long, which I sort of knew from the image but it was a lot more dramatic than I would have thought.",30515,2
30515,I got a large but I feel like I should have got a medium but then I feel like a medium would have been too short because of the legs so I don't know..,30515,2
30515,I feel like I wish I knew the dimensions of it before I bought it.,30515,2
30515,but over all I like it but it's really disappointing about the arms,30515,2
30516,It is ok for the price but very thin fabric.,30516,2
30516,Looks so much better on the model.,30516,2
30517,"I'm 5'6"" and 140 lbs and wear a 36C.",30517,2
30517,I got the large and it fit reasonably well everywhere except the chest.,30517,2
30517,The cups are WAY too narrow and close together and not adjustable.,30517,2
30517,Returning :-(,30517,2
30518,"If you are well built up top, this look is not good!",30518,2
30519,"Badly material, No answer from vendor, I want to send it back to sender.",30519,2
30520,I need a return label for both the shirts I only ordered 1 and received 2 charged for both,30520,2
30521,Ok.......so if you are young and going for the boho look.,30521,2
30521,Its totally cute.,30521,2
30521,But if your over 35 it looks dated and like your wearing something you pulled from your closet from the 80's!,30521,2
30522,The tags fall off due to poor quality strap,30522,2
30523,I love this shirt.,30523,2
30523,However the arms are too small,30523,2
30524,NIce Top..,30524,2
30524,I read the reviews some said it ran small so I ordered a size up.,30524,2
30524,But it way too BIg!,30524,2
30525,"While it was a very cute dress, I ordered an extra small (I'm about 5'3, 110lbs) and this dress was HUGE on me.",30525,2
30525,And much longer than I expected (past knees).,30525,2
30525,Like mumu meets pajama dress.,30525,2
30525,But it was soft and flowy...it would probably be cute when it fits.,30525,2
30526,"The portion that goes into the front of the earring, it goes in like a plug.",30526,2
30526,"Anyway, it breaks off rather easily making the earring fall out.",30526,2
30526,Low quality.,30526,2
30527,They zipper is coming apart!!,30527,2
30527,!,30527,2
30528,I bought the costume to wear to a 50's party.,30528,2
30528,"Purchased the L, a 10-12.",30528,2
30528,The top was on the small side and the waste was very high.,30528,2
30528,Had to return the costume.,30528,2
30528,The material was thin.,30528,2
30528,"A slip to make the skirt ""poof"" would help.",30528,2
30529,"I am not very picky or finicky when it comes to purchases or customer service, but I was very disappointed with this scarf.",30529,2
30529,"It is much more thing/lightweight than the picture shows (not too surprising considering that it's only 2.47), but my main complaint is that is came FOUR MONTHS after I ordered it.",30529,2
30529,FOUR.,30529,2
30529,"I ordered it in November, and was shocked to see the expected delivery was for the end of December/beginning of January, but then it didn't come until today, two days shy of February.",30529,2
30529,"So, needless to say it didn't end up being a Christmas gift.",30529,2
30529,"Decent quality for the cheap price, but don't count on getting it even close to soon after ordering.",30529,2
30530,Ripped after the first wash,30530,2
30531,Large for a bracelet - wouldn't stay on my daughter's wrist (nor mine) and wasn't adjustable.,30531,2
30531,Clasp a bit cheap.,30531,2
30532,Great earrings.,30532,2
30532,Even nice then pictured.,30532,2
30532,Would definitely buy from this vendor.,30532,2
30532,Shipping was fast.,30532,2
30532,Now it's a over a year old and they tarnished very badly.,30532,2
30532,I can't  wear them anymore..,30532,2
30532,Very disappointed.,30532,2
30533,Be careful ...,30533,2
30533,Does not look like the picture!,30533,2
30533,"The white is not poofy, hangs strangely, is wrinkled and see thru.",30533,2
30533,Makes a cute top over jeans or leggings tho.,30533,2
30534,My dress was too small but my daughter can wear the dress,30534,2
30535,Just fine.,30535,2
30536,They are much smaller than my American Apparel socks.,30536,2
30536,They are synthetic too.,30536,2
30536,Not real dancer socks.,30536,2
30536,If you are short and not athletic in your legs or a young girl these are for you.,30536,2
30536,They have made marks on my legs that i do not like,30536,2
30537,This dress is not made of the same quality as the Black & Orange one.,30537,2
30537,"This item is VERY thin, and it gaps under the arm.",30537,2
30537,Very cheap material and is not sewn together good at all.,30537,2
30538,Not what I expected.,30538,2
30539,I was not as pleased as with my prior purchases.,30539,2
30539,"It
 Looked like cotton and true red, however it was not as it seemed.",30539,2
30540,"After about 4 months of weekly trips to the pool, the material is shredding and the suit is falling apart at the seams.",30540,2
30540,"Its not from being stretched too tight, so I imagine it's the result of chlorine.",30540,2
30540,"16 times wearing it, and I have to throw it away.",30540,2
30541,This hat was made with horrible material.,30541,2
30541,It is not flowy (if that's a word) at all.,30541,2
30541,Its so stiff and does not give.,30541,2
30541,I bought this hat to wear on a cruise and by the time I took it out my suit case it was hard to get it back in shape to get some type of look.,30541,2
30541,I didn't even wear it.,30541,2
30541,Do not buy.,30541,2
30541,I know its cute but its not worth it.,30541,2
30542,The stone is small,30542,2
30543,Sadly had to return.,30543,2
30543,"I would have kept it, it looks great, but lost a stone  the first day",30543,2
30544,too heavy,30544,2
30545,Got  XL for my daughter it fit like a small,30545,2
30546,This jumpsuit is Asian sized.,30546,2
30546,I purchased an XL but I could NOT get it pass my thighs.,30546,2
30546,The material does not stretch but it's absolutely cute.,30546,2
30546,I choose to give it away it will fit someone who wears a medium.,30546,2
30547,Very thin material.,30547,2
30547,Did not fit well.,30547,2
30548,The cups are too small for us big breasted women and for being a 2x and only a D cup I can only imagine how it fit for other women my size and buffet tatas,30548,2
30549,"You get what you paid for, this product is absolute that.",30549,2
30549,"The material is quite cheap, the lace is too easy to shred, sag, or hook on something else.",30549,2
30549,The back is too thin that you can see through it.,30549,2
30550,"Not true to size, and it fits more like a oversized tshirt than a dress.",30550,2
30551,This is clearly an inferior product.,30551,2
30551,"No belt loop holder, unfinished edges, too wide  --  poor design & mediocre construction.",30551,2
30551,"This is a very weak offering, not worth Amazon's fronting.",30551,2
30551,It will have to be returned.,30551,2
30552,sleeves are short.,30552,2
30552,"I believe when its washed, I can put it on the cat.",30552,2
30552,"Waited  for it to ship, my fault in ordering it.",30552,2
30553,Cheaply made more like costume material then something dressy definitely too short to be a dress.,30553,2
30554,"I like the style, but just too small.",30554,2
30555,This shirt was way too big.,30555,2
30555,It was also very thin and not flattering.,30555,2
30555,I returned it.,30555,2
30556,Chest area is small.,30556,2
30557,I ordered my usual size in another color  and they fit perfect but that black ones ripped in the crotch as soon as soon as i put them on with minimal effort.,30557,2
30557,So maybe i got a defective pair?,30557,2
30558,"Looks pretty bad, it has no shape",30558,2
30559,the color faded at the first washed.,30559,2
30560,This dress is really pretty as appears as pictured but runs super small.,30560,2
30560,I typically wear a 16 ladies and ordered a 3X but it is at least 3 sizes to small in the chest area.,30560,2
30561,"It's cute, way too short, doesn't cover my rear... And too small, would recommend ordering 2 sizes up",30561,2
30562,Cute but runs really small.,30562,2
30562,Had to send them back,30562,2
30563,Eh,30563,2
30564,way too small,30564,2
30565,Very cheap.,30565,2
30565,They do not stay on.,30565,2
30565,Buy the name brand and don't waste your money.,30565,2
30566,Really poor quality.,30566,2
30566,The seams started to pull apart before I got them half the way on and the color and design only go to the seam so when it pulled apart you could see white where the fabric wasn't printed.,30566,2
30566,It seemed as if the stitching wasn't done properly.,30566,2
30566,They are also very low rise.,30566,2
30567,Shrunk gave to my 7 y/o daughter fits her perfect.,30567,2
30568,They are very big well the pearl is very white which make them look cheep,30568,2
30569,Looks cute but deceiving.,30569,2
30569,It is from an overseas company so the size chart is not our size chart runs very small.,30569,2
30569,The buckles didn't come attached.,30569,2
30569,You have to put all 4 on your self.,30569,2
30569,"Also, the button holes are not opened they were sewn shut!",30569,2
30569,I had to cut the button holes open to avoid the shipping them back headache.,30569,2
30569,"When I received them finally, I felt like I was working in the factory to make them.",30569,2
30569,I wound up giving them to my 16 year old daughter and it fit but snug smh,30569,2
30570,"Even though I wear a medium, I ordered large and it ran somewhat small and short..elastic on sleeves tight.",30570,2
30570,Decided to give it to someone else.,30570,2
30571,wife could not fit,30571,2
30572,No,30572,2
30573,"Love their darkness but the plastic smell is pretty bad, smells toxic so I don't wear them.",30573,2
30574,Arrived earlier than expected all the way from China.,30574,2
30574,Very pretty.,30574,2
30574,No instructions so I am stuck with a watch I don't understand.,30574,2
30575,Be careful when ordering this.,30575,2
30575,The size seems to be the asian one.,30575,2
30575,The large I ordered looks more like a medium.,30575,2
30576,poorly made,30576,2
30577,I really love the design of this shoe but I couldn't wear these for more than an hour.,30577,2
30577,They were really uncomfortable and pinched my toes.,30577,2
30578,"I ordered these in a size large (which supposedly fits up to a 31.5"" waist and 40.5"" hips... my measurements are 29"" and 38"") and these were SO SMALL that I had to check the tag to make sure the right size came in my box.",30578,2
30578,"I trusted the (later) reviews about the large fitting, but these are not a good idea to order if you're borderline on the measurements I guess?",30578,2
30578,"Additionally I ordered these on March 4th and the ""expected delivery day"" was March 8th.",30578,2
30578,"I received an e-mail on March 9th saying there was a ""delay in shipping.""",30578,2
30578,"I had planned to get these for a cruise which was leaving on March 11th, and thought that ordering a week in advance would be good ~wiggle room~ in case there was an issue.",30578,2
30578,These shorts were delivered to my apartment March 11th @ 6pm.,30578,2
30578,Don't waste your money on these.,30578,2
30578,Thankfully I also ordered Simplicity Women's High Waisted Pompom Tassel Trim Beach Casual Gym Mini Shorts (which are a very similar style) and they arrived EARLIER than expected and fit PERFECTLY.,30578,2
30578,"Shipping may cost more, but they're a much better material and fit as expected.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simplicity-Women-Pompom-Tassel-Trim-Mini-Shorts-Pants-MultiColor-Print-019-XL/dp/B00ZHNOY48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simplicity Women Pompom Tassel Trim Mini Shorts Pants, MultiColor Print #019 XL</a>",30578,2
30579,"This company does not make U.S. sizes correctly and that is a shame, because the clothes are nice.",30579,2
30579,I gave shirts away.,30579,2
30579,I ordered x-large and they fit my friend who wears a size medium.,30579,2
30580,"I would've been happy with these but they are just too bulky on the tongue, flat on the bottom.",30580,2
30580,"No cushion, no support, no comfort.",30580,2
30581,"Dress runs larger, and material is thin.",30581,2
30581,Shows every lump and bump.,30581,2
30581,"Not for me, but pretty dress maybe for someone tall and thin, however, buy a size smaller.",30581,2
30582,The covers are hard which makes the wallet unnecessarily thick,30582,2
30583,"Pros: Colors are brilliant, fun, and as pictured.",30583,2
30583,Cons:  Two (animal print) out of the four are not stretchy enough to get over my calf.,30583,2
30583,"The other two are more stretchy and go over my calf, but the heel is at the back of my ankle (size 7.5 tennis shoe).",30583,2
30584,Cute but it was way too large so it looks more like a tucked in t-shirt.,30584,2
30585,"The waist is really small, with all that fabric of the slip.",30585,2
30585,"It's well made, though.",30585,2
30585,WAY too much fabric for me.,30585,2
30585,Could almost be worn as a skirt itself!,30585,2
30585,"I'd say the waist is about 24"".",30585,2
30585,"The crinoline-like fabric isn't as stiff as some, but still stiff and takes up alot of room.",30585,2
30585,Too much slip for a folkloric or most any dance production.,30585,2
30585,There's 2-3 times more fabric than I need.,30585,2
30585,Looks like photo in ad.,30585,2
30586,Cute but REALLY small.,30586,2
30587,"I used this wallet after having issues with the ""Hide and Seek"" Bellroy wallet.",30587,2
30587,"It's nice, if you only want to take 3 or 4 cards with you and nothing else.",30587,2
30587,"There is no secure way to hold bills in this wallet, so be prepared to have them fall out when you open it.",30587,2
30587,"Unzipping the wallet around adults made me feel like a child in professional environments, I also ended up stuffing my cards and money into my pocket as I didn't have time to zip and unzip the wallet after making a purchase.",30587,2
30587,"The leather wore in extremely fast, and also made me wonder about how the cards are held inside, as there is a very defined inch line at the bottom of the wallet where nothing goes, maybe it's for change?",30587,2
30587,"Also the metal emblem is VERY out of place, and catches on things.",30587,2
30587,"There is a leather slit on the inside that may be for a key, but mine wasn't opened beyond the leather being cut, so if something was to go in there it couldn't.",30587,2
30587,"After having 2 Bellroy wallets, I will no longer be buying anything from this company.",30587,2
30588,Cute but I'm apparently too tall to wear it.,30588,2
30588,I'm 5'10 and I couldn't even put it on all the way.,30588,2
30589,Feel cheap and way smaller than described.,30589,2
30590,"It is my size, put it is tighter as I expected.",30590,2
30590,So you can actually see it because my legs get marks of it.,30590,2
30591,Actual color is much darker.,30591,2
30591,Not as shown in picture.,30591,2
30591,"Zipper is very cheap, first time I tried to zip it up it split open.",30591,2
30591,Overall fabric is comfortable but stitches are also cheap and slowly come apart.,30591,2
30592,The jacket is too small.,30592,2
30592,US medium is still too small.,30592,2
30592,I did check and compare the size before bough.,30592,2
30593,Cheap,30593,2
30594,"Material is cheap, wore it once and there is tears near the middle.",30594,2
30595,"I bought these for my 3.5 year old daughter, I bought size 2-3 years considering people said they ran big.",30595,2
30595,Well they were easy to get on but kept falling off as the elastic was not tight enough around her wrists and the velcro pretty much did nothing.,30595,2
30595,Wish I could return them!,30595,2
30595,When on though they did keep her hands warm and she liked them for playing in the snow.,30595,2
30596,did not fit me it was small I gave it to my cuz and she loves it very sexy,30596,2
30597,I didn't really like the neon colors.,30597,2
30597,It also pinches in at the waist in a weird way.,30597,2
30598,Does not stay up...,30598,2
30599,I have diastasis recti and this helps me feel more stable and put together when I'm working out.,30599,2
30599,However it is super hard to put on myself and would be better if there were two separate pieces that came across.,30599,2
30599,It gets bunched easily when I try to Velcro it myself but it is fine if my husband helps.,30599,2
30599,It does not conform well to my body though and I get painful red lines at my waistline after wearing it for an hour or so.,30599,2
30599,I would also like it a lot more if it were longer and covered my torso completely.,30599,2
30600,A bit smaller than expected,30600,2
30601,The cloth was too thin.,30601,2
30602,So dissapoint... my stone is not all purple like in the picture I know it has a good quality but is not like the picture,30602,2
30603,Too Big for me,30603,2
30604,They are cute BUT they are way to tight..,30604,2
30604,The bar itself is snugged tight compared to the bar i was given when pierced.,30604,2
30604,The circle part was even tighter.,30604,2
30604,I couldn't fit it at all.,30604,2
30604,"After cleaning it with green soap, I noticed one of the bars had gotten a dark spot like if the paint came of.... with the discoloration of the bar and with the tightness.. i don't want to risk getting an infection or getting my nipple irritated",30604,2
30605,Like,30605,2
30606,it's not what i expected.,30606,2
30606,"a bit to flimsy, just for my personal taste.",30606,2
30606,runs very small,30606,2
30607,Disappointed in this item.,30607,2
30607,Looks cute online and much less cute in reality.,30607,2
30607,Fits oddly and I hate the material.,30607,2
30608,Very sheer.,30608,2
30608,Would need to wear a long slip under it.,30608,2
30609,I am disappointed in the quality of the fabric...especially the sleeve pattern which looks very cheap.,30609,2
30609,"If I had seen it in a store, I would not have purchased it.",30609,2
30610,"The size and color are good, but it arrived smelling AWFUL.",30610,2
30610,Like dead fish.,30610,2
30610,"And the leather is not particularly good quality, but I guess I would not expect that for the price.",30610,2
30610,I would not recommend this to anyone.,30610,2
30611,"Poor quality and looks cheap, like a toy.",30611,2
30611,One lens popped out of the frame the very 1st day after a 1ft fall on hard-wood floor.,30611,2
30611,Not worth the price.,30611,2
30611,I would not buy again.,30611,2
30612,It does not come as proportionate as it looks,30612,2
30613,"Loved this design for years, and when I finally ordered it, much to my dismay it was way too short.",30613,2
30613,"It might as well have been the 3/4 version of a crop top, which I do not look good in.",30613,2
30613,Really disappointed :c,30613,2
30614,Product does not match the picture unfortunately.,30614,2
30614,The one I received did not have the metal barbell but instead had simple knots tied in the cord.,30614,2
30614,"This is unfortunate since I was trying to replace one that had broken with an exact duplicate, and this is definitely not that but a cheaper lower quality version.",30614,2
30614,"Don't buy based on the picture, you will be disappointed.",30614,2
30615,I wanted a quick throw on then it get a bit colder.,30615,2
30615,"Unfortunately, up close this one looks cheap.",30615,2
30615,"It's a cute design, but I'm only going to wear it around the house.",30615,2
30616,Run very small,30616,2
30617,to big,30617,2
30618,The colors of this towel are great.,30618,2
30618,"The fabric is cheap feeling and paper thin, not your typical beach towel terry cloth.",30618,2
30618,It does not feel like it would absorb water well or hold up to washing.,30618,2
30619,It's big.,30619,2
30619,The brim is really big.,30619,2
30619,It will fit someday...,30619,2
30620,"Beautiful dress, sizes run 1-2 sizes larger than expected",30620,2
30621,Got this today.,30621,2
30621,Shipped fast but that was the only good thing about this top.,30621,2
30621,Looks similar to the photo but the anchor was not a floral pattern at all.,30621,2
30621,Just liked like globs of paint.,30621,2
30621,The shirt also had a hole in it upon arrival.,30621,2
30621,I do not recommend but if you are considering it order a size up.,30621,2
30622,not true to size- other wise would be nice if I could wear it,30622,2
30623,poor poor quality,30623,2
30624,It is quite loose-fitting.,30624,2
30624,"I ordered the light blue version and was disappointed at how far from  a""light"" computer",30624,2
30625,Not as nice as I would have liked for the price .,30625,2
30625,Plus it is also very small,30625,2
30626,"I was extremely disappointed that after studying hundreds of options, I carefully chose a particular print and color, only to open the box and find something quite different than I had chosen.",30626,2
30626,Buyer beware!,30626,2
30627,"Nice design but a weird double layer zipper, Dress was tight around my waist but too big in the breast area.",30627,2
30627,I'll donate it to a charity.,30627,2
30628,"The thonly get was kinda ridiculously large, but the top fits like a glove.",30628,2
30628,"Needs thicker fabric, the bottom ruffles a bit easy while on.",30628,2
30629,This skirt never fit my first lady apparently.,30629,2
30629,We recently went through the lingerie cabinet and this skirt that I though fit her well was in the trash pile.,30629,2
30629,I asked why and she said it never fit.,30629,2
30629,Xl didn't fit her 16/18 frame and booty.,30629,2
30629,Oh well,30629,2
30630,Weird fit.,30630,2
30630,"Gave it to Goodwill, without a single wear.",30630,2
30631,Looks different from the picture.,30631,2
30632,Below expectations,30632,2
30633,Useless to me.,30633,2
30634,I have purchased a lot of Mud Pie clothing in the past and have always been pleased with the quality.,30634,2
30634,I was highly disappointed with the quality of this bag and the matching weekender and tote bags.,30634,2
30634,"It's made of very thin, cheap canvas trimmed with low quality leather which was somewhat frayed on edges.",30634,2
30634,The monogram imprint was poorly done also.,30634,2
30635,Product much smaller than photo made it look.,30635,2
30635,Disappointed with purchase.,30635,2
30636,really cute but to small on the bust size you really need to be small chested,30636,2
30637,Tutu was way too small.,30637,2
30637,It did not fit my newborn.,30637,2
30637,Headband and tutu were way different know color.,30637,2
30638,Glad to receive it but was not real happy with how tiny the eyes were.,30638,2
30638,:(,30638,2
30639,It looks pretty in the picture to me but in person was a different story.,30639,2
30639,I thought it looked kinda cheap.,30639,2
30639,The arms which look pretty in the picture looked like you put your childs little cape on!,30639,2
30639,It looked too small and funny.,30639,2
30639,I returned it.,30639,2
30640,Cute but was unlined and had no support around the bottom band of the top could really have used elastic,30640,2
30641,Love the sunglasses but it came with one of the screws missing,30641,2
30642,Too small and not what I had expected.,30642,2
30643,"The fit is nos as expected around neckline,  it just doesn't look right",30643,2
30644,Weird fitting.,30644,2
30644,Might lose a boobs if you jump around,30644,2
30645,Ordered two sizes and received two completely different dresses.,30645,2
30645,Color and pattern.,30645,2
30646,dont like,30646,2
30647,Material is cheap,30647,2
30648,Bad,30648,2
30649,the bottoms material rolls up and look horrible.,30649,2
30649,and it looks as if it was stitched wrong and off set..,30649,2
30650,I was very disappointed in the colour.,30650,2
30650,The colour is far ftom what was in the picture.,30650,2
30650,I want dark brown instead i got a lighter brown bag,30650,2
30651,way way too small and is not at all as long as it appears in the image.,30651,2
30651,I usually wear a medium and I got an XL...I could hardly get it on!,30651,2
30652,They started wearing out immediately in patches and around the seams.,30652,2
30653,"Comfortable cotton, but fit runs very small.",30653,2
30654,Fits a 14 year old.,30654,2
30654,Not an xl.,30654,2
30655,I should've known how thin these leggings were going to be.,30655,2
30655,I already had holes forming in and around the crotch as well as serious fading after just 2-3 wears.,30655,2
30655,"Sure it's a nice pattern, but it is not worth the money.",30655,2
30656,Beautiful but both broke quickly and the gold faded after 3 uses,30656,2
30657,They wasn't what I thought they were.,30657,2
30657,They were too smaill,30657,2
30658,Not pleased with the quality of this purse.,30658,2
30658,Very stiff shape and seems like cardboard base.,30658,2
30659,Runs way too small.,30659,2
30660,Do not like fabric.,30660,2
30661,Shirt fits nicely but it looks dinghy.,30661,2
30661,Will not be wearing it to the event I planned because it looks terrible.,30661,2
30662,The chino fit is different know I don't like the new style,30662,2
30663,It's warm but there is no pockets and batman Is black and yellow not gold..,30663,2
30663,There's strings on the bottom but they have no use.,30663,2
30663,I'm happy but it's not what I was expecting,30663,2
30664,"The color was nice, and the style seemed good hanging up...but the liner of the dress was made from a material that had absolutely NO stretch to it.",30664,2
30664,I had two of my bridesmaids try it on.,30664,2
30664,"One who it should have fit, which she couldn't even pull it all the way on.",30664,2
30664,The other who was smaller put the dress on but couldn't walk or really move because the material had no give or stretch.,30664,2
30664,This dress could never work for a bridesmaid with the restrictive material.,30664,2
30665,Fit is very small.,30665,2
30665,Won't be able to use it.,30665,2
30666,Elastic is rough and they run small,30666,2
30667,Wore glasses 2 days & they cracked right down the middle.,30667,2
30668,"Loved this when I first got it but the long strap broke after 3 weeks, cheap material.",30668,2
30669,not as accepted,30669,2
30670,"I always wear a size small, bra 34b, this shirt was pretty and so were the straps but there was large gaps around the armpit/ boob area.",30670,2
30670,Probably gonna give it away bc im not gonna be able to wear it,30670,2
30671,I ordered a small.,30671,2
30671,The top was too small and the the bottom was loose.,30671,2
30672,They run entirely too small to cost entirely too much.,30672,2
30672,Returned.,30672,2
30673,I would consider these more like a leotard or thick pantyhose.,30673,2
30673,"Actually, I probably have some pantyhose/tights that are less see through than these.",30673,2
30673,"I am not a big girl (5 ft even, usually a small/medium) and even the black color stretched thin.",30673,2
30673,These will be okay under dresses but I definitely will not wear them with just a shirt or tunic.,30673,2
30674,Picture looks like it's made of cotton but it's really acrylic...,30674,2
30675,"too small, it's an Asian size, I will be returning.",30675,2
30676,I bought these pants for winter fishing.,30676,2
30676,Not sure how warm they would be if warn in the cold by themselves as I where them under some pretty heavy duty ice fishing bibs.,30676,2
30676,They seem reasonable well made.,30676,2
30676,I did order I size or to larger than I would if ordering in US as they are made in Asia and they fit fine.,30676,2
30676,Over all I would say worth the money they were relatively cheap and they haven't fallen apart after a couple months use.,30676,2
30676,"(amendment to review and ratings follows)
:These pants seem alright at first but after one washing they look like I have had them for three years!",30676,2
30676,also some of the stitching is now coming out.,30676,2
30676,I wish China would stop making such cheap crappy stuff!,30676,2
30676,"I guess its my owm fault for continually falling for the ""bargain"" priced item with at least mediocre reviews.",30676,2
30676,I think probably all of us wouldn't mind paying a little above bargain price as long as we knew quality and longevity was there.,30676,2
30676,Unfortunately there are no guarantees which leaves us trial and error shopping.,30676,2
30676,Amazon cannot be beat for this kind of shopping they have taken care of me as a customer from day one.,30676,2
30676,I have a hard time shopping anywhere else now.,30676,2
30676,Even companies I have been a customer to for over ten years like sportsmansguide and cabelas cannot touch amazons service when it comes to keeping the customer happy and having low prices.,30676,2
30676,The way my other shopping experiences have been going I will probably eventually not even consider anything not shipped by amazon.,30676,2
30676,But I digress bottom line these pants are not worth the price,30676,2
30677,My neck doesn't fit it.,30677,2
30677,May need to get necklace extender.,30677,2
30678,"It's cute on but the seam threading runs ling,  and for about an inch or so hangs off the edge of the sleeve.",30678,2
30678,Obviously this is an inexpensive top and I did not expect it to be super amazing I just thought it was so cute I wanted it.,30678,2
30679,Much too small for the measurements given on the size chart and the fur had some funky creases in it that I wasn't sure would smooth out.,30679,2
30680,"It is a pretty burnished brown color, and has a nice looking buckle but the product description is misleading.",30680,2
30680,"It is only 7/8 of an inch wide, and not 1 1/8 as stated.",30680,2
30680,"It  already had 5 pre-punched holes, and no hole puncher was included.",30680,2
30680,The belt was very flimsy and thin and I am finding it very hard to believe it is real leather!,30680,2
30680,"No wonder the price was too good to be true, considering a good leather belt can be easily $40 or more!",30680,2
30680,I am immediately returning it.,30680,2
30681,"This is a nice graphic tshirt, the part ""BEAST"" and drawing are very well printed.",30681,2
30681,"However, first time you wear this shirt you notice that the tissue, cotton is the worst quality possible.",30681,2
30681,I bought recently a T-shirt for 4 $ which has a better building quality than this one.,30681,2
30681,I went on a brief walk with this and seemed like a punishment.,30681,2
30681,"If only they have imported a better tissue, this could've been a nice shirt",30681,2
30682,Very cute but too small.,30682,2
30683,I ordered size 3x.,30683,2
30683,"The tanks tops I received looked like they ""might"" fit a 12 year old girl.",30683,2
30683,So disappointed!!!,30683,2
30683,I am returning them asap.,30683,2
30684,Not so happy with this one.,30684,2
30684,It's cut very narrow.,30684,2
30684,"It fits as a size 2-4, but was hoping for a little more room since it's supposed to be worn as a sweatshirt over another shirt.",30684,2
30684,Material is some kind of felt.,30684,2
30684,"I haven't washed it, but I expect it will shrink or fall apart when I do.",30684,2
30684,Didn't return it because it was so cheap it would've cost more than it was worth.,30684,2
30685,the top of the belt separates from the bottom very quickly.,30685,2
30685,You get what you pay for.,30685,2
30686,Didn't even try them on because the color was so off/different from the picture that I am going to try to give them away.,30686,2
30686,The picture looked like a beautiful smoky teal blue but they were ELECTRIC COBALT blue.,30686,2
30686,Maybe I'll wear them if I decide to run in the dark!,30686,2
30686,I am giving them two stars only because of how soft they seem.,30686,2
30686,Too bad I cannot return them.,30686,2
30687,This outfit would be great if you had small legs and no hips.,30687,2
30687,It runs small,30687,2
30688,"size usually small , ordered medium

came little tight",30688,2
30689,Cheaply made thick plasticky material more typical of the $10 asian crap on Amazon.,30689,2
30689,"Would be embarassing to be seen in a product that screams ""cheap"".",30689,2
30689,It is a shame as the fit and cut is fantastic.,30689,2
30689,"Will stick to my regular swim briefs, even if they cost $50-65.",30689,2
30690,too heavy plastic,30690,2
30691,The costume is ok at best.,30691,2
30691,"The top was fine although shorter than I hoped for (I'm 5'10 with even proportions), but the skirt is awful.",30691,2
30691,The sewing was done haphazardly and there were several places with the skirt bunched up in the seam and the fabric looked terrible.,30691,2
30691,The pleats at the center were completely off center too.,30691,2
30691,I took the skirt off and reattached it so it laid smoothly and was even.,30691,2
30691,The skirt had several places where the blue was coming off because the material is cheap.,30691,2
30691,If it got snagged on something or was pulled at all it would turn white and look awful.,30691,2
30691,Order down a size or two.,30691,2
30691,"If you're on the larger end of what each size will fit, order down 1 size.",30691,2
30691,"If you're on the smaller end of each size, go 2 sizes smaller.",30691,2
30691,I'd prefer straps on it even if they're clear or any way to keep the top up better.,30691,2
30691,Because it fits such a large range there is a TON of elastic on the back and if you're not pulling it tight it doesn't stay up and had an unflattering fit.,30691,2
30691,The boot covers are poorly made too.,30691,2
30691,I have big calves and they were too big on me.,30691,2
30691,They won't stay up and there's no real way for the cover to stay in place.,30691,2
30691,There's only an elastic that's supposed to go under your shoe but that doesn't work because It attaches with Velcro on the bottom of the shoe so you're stepping on it the whole time.,30691,2
30691,The only way to keep this in place would be to spray glue it to whatever shoes your wearing.,30691,2
30691,You're better off buying the actual boots which look awesome.,30691,2
30691,Too bad I saw them too late to get here in time.,30691,2
30691,I wouldn't buy this again unless I was desperate.,30691,2
30692,The light does not shine at all.,30692,2
30693,Not completely what i wanted,30693,2
30694,Not as pic,30694,2
30695,It fell apart when i only wore it once.,30695,2
30695,The seams came undone and I had to toss it since the material is so cheap that you can't repair it without ruining the fabric.,30695,2
30696,Small hole in front of neck  collar,30696,2
30697,Skin broke out into a rash.,30697,2
30698,When I first wear it I was in love with it until one day I was on my way to Marshall with my friends when I got off the car one side by the hook came off I was very embarrass,30698,2
30699,"I bought this necklace and another one form other  seller :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REINDEAR-Moive-Titanic-Pretty-HEART-OF-THE-OCEAN-Big-Czech-Blue-CRYSTAL-Pendant-NECKLACE-US-Seller/dp/B00LJM4FAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REINDEAR Moive Titanic Pretty HEART OF THE OCEAN Big Czech Blue CRYSTAL Pendant NECKLACE US Seller</a>

What I like about this product :

Nothing

What I don't like about it :

-chain broke in first second.",30699,2
30699,"-most importantly, doesn't look like the pictures
-see the pictures to understand

So,

I recommend buying from the other link that i inserted ,,",30699,2
30700,Very nice but too small had to go up 2 sizes to get the right fit.,30700,2
30701,Beautiful color but I got a small and it fit like a tarp.,30701,2
30701,"I didn't have time to get something else so I had to severely alter it, which cost more than the garment",30701,2
30702,The necklace did not come as expected.,30702,2
30702,The blue piece was glued on weird and the silver moon around it was missing a few pieces.,30702,2
30703,"Too small and the top does not fit ""naturally"".",30703,2
30704,I likes the finish but it is huge.,30704,2
30704,Not a very tight fit and doesn't hold its spring.,30704,2
30704,I would stick with a good quality metal or stainless.,30704,2
30705,poor quality and material,30705,2
30706,Short and small.,30706,2
30706,Off it went to the donation bin.,30706,2
30707,"Love the graphics but the material is not as pictured, it's very wispy and tears easily",30707,2
30708,Nice quality and very cute zip case.,30708,2
30708,But the sunglasses are too large.,30708,2
30708,They fit my husband and my own face better than either of my sons.,30708,2
30709,"It's very nice and I would have loved to wear it, but it was way too small.",30709,2
30710,"It looks great when it comes, but the material rubs off from being in a pocket.",30710,2
30710,Ordered this for my husband & within a week it was worn considerably.,30710,2
30710,"Also note that he doesn't wear tight jeans or slacks, usually loose fitting basketball shorts so the wear & tear was unexpected to say the least.",30710,2
30711,"I read all the reviews and descriptions for this product when trying to decide on a size for my daughter, it turned out to be to big in the straps and the waist.",30711,2
30712,I have tiny hands so these are huge on me making the touch screen feature hard to use.,30712,2
30712,Cute and warm though.,30712,2
30713,Bra says it holds DDs.,30713,2
30713,Mine barely held Cs,30713,2
30714,It does not fit around my big body and does not dry well.,30714,2
30714,The color is beautiful.,30714,2
30715,Didnt like the material.,30715,2
30716,"These gloves are thick, comfortable and warm.",30716,2
30716,"The finger tips are bulky, however, so you can't pick up smaller things.",30716,2
30716,For some reason there's extra leather added on finger tips which is what makes them bulky.,30716,2
30716,"Also, the gloves' touchy part is exactly at the flat front of the finger and thumb tips.",30716,2
30716,"Hence they only allow a flat touch, which is neither ergonomic nor accurate.",30716,2
30717,I have bought many leggings these are smaller than I expected and not nearly as streatchy as others I have bought because of that they re hard to put on and the fabric is not very breathable,30717,2
30718,Dislike is it rolls up on your thighs,30718,2
30719,I had to return this suit.,30719,2
30719,It was too large.,30719,2
30719,The price was excellent but quality wasn't very good.,30719,2
30720,For the price I guess it's ok.,30720,2
30720,But it looks nothing like the picture.,30720,2
30720,No defined features it's all flat.,30720,2
30721,Extremely small.,30721,2
30721,Not sure of the size it says is correct...,30721,2
30721,"Bout this belt for my fianc&eacute; in his normal size, but it only buckles on the verge last hole...",30721,2
30722,This is a very beautiful rung but it is plated and will turn your figure green,30722,2
30723,I love everything about this top -- except that it's so sheer that I can see even a nude bra through it.,30723,2
30723,"Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker for me.",30723,2
30723,I'll have to send the top back.,30723,2
30724,It was a gift and to me it was cheap looking and feeling.,30724,2
30725,I was not particularly pleased with this product.,30725,2
30725,I actually am returning it.,30725,2
30725,The top was big and the length was shorter than expected.,30725,2
30725,It was not as pretty in person as it looked online.,30725,2
30726,The majority of plus size women have a plus size chest to match.,30726,2
30726,"Unfortunately, this bathing suit does not.",30726,2
30726,"For the thick thighs ladies, it does fit to size.",30726,2
30726,"For the big chest ladies, purchase with caution; by big chest, I mean anything over a C cup.",30726,2
30726,The suit has padding and underwire.,30726,2
30726,I don't need these knockers to look any bigger than they already are.,30726,2
30727,I bought this two sizes bigger but it didn't come down down far enough on my stomach.,30727,2
30728,Looks like a table cloth when you get it.,30728,2
30728,Does not look like picture,30728,2
30729,i WEAR IT....BUT it is longer on one side then the other.,30729,2
30730,Nahhh its bot worth it if yor looking for a nice dress the tulle at the bottom is bothing like the picture if you're looking to seem cheap go for it if not i do recommend this for you,30730,2
30731,Nice jeans but way smalll i wear a 13 n curvy so i ordered a 15 to b safe n i cudnt get em past my hips order like 2-3 sizes up,30731,2
30732,"Cheap, not worth the price",30732,2
30733,The black belt is flimsy and very cheap appearance.,30733,2
30733,It comes undone with any movement.,30733,2
30733,Returning this dress.,30733,2
30734,I agree 100% with reviewer ispringer.,30734,2
30734,"These don't fit at all like my other PJJ's... Waist too big, legs too tight.",30734,2
30734,"Also, these have either been worn, or the stitching is defective at the drawstring (one of the holes is bigger and looks torn).",30734,2
30734,These will be going back.,30734,2
30734,"The color and fabric are nice though, if only they fit true to size.",30734,2
30735,It's itchy and the edges are sharp,30735,2
30736,I picked the wrong bangle .it's was for a child,30736,2
30737,The slit is EXTREMELY high so you would have to wear something underneath...with that being said I'm not into it.,30737,2
30737,"I'm 5'3"" and the slit was at my waist!",30737,2
30738,They were a lot smaller than expected.,30738,2
30739,Disappointed.,30739,2
30739,We are going to return this.,30739,2
30739,Surface of this bag gets scratch even if touched by finger .,30739,2
30739,We need more sturdy bag.,30739,2
30740,The skirt is much shorter than what it looks like on the model.,30740,2
30741,poor quality,30741,2
30742,way too small.,30742,2
30742,I had to return it.,30742,2
30742,"I bought a large I am 5'5"" and 150 lbs",30742,2
30743,too short,30743,2
30744,To large across the shoulders.,30744,2
30744,And bottom to long,30744,2
30745,"The bathing suit itself was very cute and I had no problems at all with the style, colors, material, etc.",30745,2
30745,"However, the fit was not at all as expected.",30745,2
30745,I ordered a small bathing suit (I normally wear a size 4 in bottoms and a size small in tops).,30745,2
30745,"The top fit great, looked good on me, and was stretchy and comfortable, but I couldn't even get the bottoms up past my hips; it wasn't stretchy at all.",30745,2
30745,"I would definitely want to buy this bathing suit, but only if I could get a different size top and bottoms, which the seller informed me they did not do because they only sell both pieces together and in the same size.",30745,2
30746,"I'm 6' 2"" and have always worn XL Hanes undershirts but these are way too short after only a couple of trips through the washer and dryer.",30746,2
30746,Everything seemed normal except for the length.,30746,2
30747,Very cute but too small.,30747,2
30748,"This jacket was way too small, love the style.",30748,2
30749,The fit is not great.,30749,2
30749,Disappointing.,30749,2
30750,"it has some small holes, doesn't fit well, extremely light weight material.",30750,2
30751,It did not come put together so I had to figure out how to lace it up properly,30751,2
30752,"It arrived two months later than I was told, and it did not take long for the stone to fall out as it was only held together by a tiny bit of glue.",30752,2
30752,"Very disappointed, never got to wear it.",30752,2
30753,Fit good but are plated and caused a huge infection.,30753,2
30753,THIS IS PLATED!!!!,30753,2
30753,NOT REAL STAINLESS STEEL,30753,2
30754,"Pretty on someone, just not me!",30754,2
30755,The straps broke.,30755,2
30755,Very cheaply made,30755,2
30756,Zipper broke within two weeks.,30756,2
30756,You get what you pay for.,30756,2
30757,"I ordered a large and the tag in the tank top is large, but it is a small, and the fabric is very thin and it is cut very low in the front.",30757,2
30757,"When I look at the picture this tank looks like it will come to the hips, it fits just below the belly.",30757,2
30757,"I am 5' 1"" and petite and brought this tank to exercise in, but it would be uncomfortable, as I prefer loose tops either large or x-large tanks to cover my bottom and hips.",30757,2
30757,I have gotten better cotton fabric and patriotic tanks from Walmart than this seller.,30757,2
30757,"It's cheap, don't waste your money.",30757,2
30757,The seller has refunded my money and I will return their item to them.,30757,2
30758,The case is a little stiff.,30758,2
30758,Otherwise looks okay.,30758,2
30758,"However, the mirror is cloudy and smeared.",30758,2
30758,I tried cleaning it with Windex glass wipe but didn't resolve the problem.,30758,2
30758,Am returning.,30758,2
30759,The pants are of decent quality and overall more fashionable than rugged.,30759,2
30759,The cut is tight around the groin and not much flexibility.,30759,2
30759,If you are looking for military grade for camping or other outdoor activities these are not the pants for you.,30759,2
30760,It ok,30760,2
30761,Tank top is small and rides up during a work out.,30761,2
30761,"It is cute, though.",30761,2
30762,The material was very hard to withstand and the top didn't fit right at all.,30762,2
30762,The bottoms worked pretty well and they're the only reason I'm rating more than one star.,30762,2
30763,I read a lot of reviews that said they didn't receive the tie that was pictured.,30763,2
30763,"I was hoping I'd be lucky but nope, the tie and handkerchief are completely different than in the photo, and the shirt is a much brighter blue too.",30763,2
30763,Very disappointing!,30763,2
30764,Thin fabric and run really small!,30764,2
30765,Very thin and shrunk quite a bit after one washing.,30765,2
30765,The snowman detail isn't that great for the price.,30765,2
30766,Pros:  -They are cheep.,30766,2
30766,"- Comfortable enough
Cons:  -They smudge really easily,
  - One is scratched slightly and one came with a dent, not to bad, but noticeable.",30766,2
30766,- Not very reflective.,30766,2
30766,"I received these fast with prime, they came in a plastic bubble wrap bag, individually wrapped in ziplock bags.",30766,2
30766,"They had a shiny paper tag on each pair reading ""Airforce"" or something like that, a sticker on the left lens reading ""Original classics - Uv 400"" and one reading Something else on the other lens.",30766,2
30767,"I bought two of the ""Belle Donne"" camisole tops, both size medium.",30767,2
30767,"The seller gives the impression that the tops you will receive will be ""Belle Donne"" brand but there is no such thing.",30767,2
30767,In reality they sent me a size small in the active basic brand in black and a olive in size medium in the Zenana brand.,30767,2
30767,"(the olive color isn't green, it's an odd  brown color with slight green undertones) If I would have known that the tops were going to randomly selected from a grab bag of cheap tops I wouldn't have spent 10 bucks a piece on them!",30767,2
30767,"The active basic brand tops are slightly better than the Zenana brand, so I would recommend getting the active basic four pack by Active Products on Amazon.",30767,2
30767,It's 15 to 20 bucks (depending on the colors you choose) for four camis.,30767,2
30767,It's a better value and you will actually get the tops that you see on the website so there won't be any surprises!,30767,2
30768,it rips really fast.,30768,2
30768,Not good at all.,30768,2
30769,I ordered this and it fit my wife more than I.,30769,2
30769,We are a foot size different.,30769,2
30769,Also be warned you better be skinny.,30769,2
30769,If you lift weights or have some weight to you...it's a very tight fit.,30769,2
30770,The shoes are really cute.,30770,2
30770,My daughter LOVES the way they look.,30770,2
30770,"HOWEVER, there is a part of the stitching inside the shoe that is so uncomfortable that my daughter won't wear these.",30770,2
30770,She yells when we put them on.,30770,2
30770,"She has small, narrow feet and these shoes are the next size up so it's not a sizing issue.",30770,2
30770,Very disappointed.,30770,2
30770,She loves Frozen.,30770,2
30771,"Like others who have purchased this shirt, any printing on the back  is missing.",30771,2
30771,I fully expect this shirt to slowly disappear after a years worth of laundry.,30771,2
30772,Nice but too small,30772,2
30773,I'm so upset with this order!,30773,2
30773,I paid an extra $5 for 2 day shipping because I needed this costume ASAP for a Great Gatsby party at school.,30773,2
30773,I just received and opened it 5 minutes ago and I already have an issue.,30773,2
30773,It only came with the dress and not the headband!,30773,2
30773,Not only did it just have the dress but the dress wasn't even finished being made!!!!,30773,2
30773,It still had some of the fringe not unraveled yet and it was still attached to a long piece of string.,30773,2
30773,So upset right now because it fit perfectly and I need this by next Wednesday!,30773,2
30773,!,30773,2
30774,The top was way to small but bottom for okay,30774,2
30775,This was bought for my husband and he was disappointed in the product.,30775,2
30775,The belt occasionally slip out from the back of the buckle and the tip on the insert end of the belt catches on clothing and has partially come of the belt a few time.,30775,2
30775,We don't think we will be buying this product again.,30775,2
30775,Sorry.,30775,2
30776,Awful.,30776,2
30776,They look great in the picture but they don't stay in place.,30776,2
30776,They hang down and look silly.,30776,2
30777,"Don't waste your time, I am 5'3 I weigh 130 pounds I bought the medium size it fit me like a glove but it's butt lifting section of the spanks don't lift at all!",30777,2
30777,It looks like your bum is falling out of the holes.,30777,2
30778,Too small.,30778,2
30778,Will need to try again.,30778,2
30778,Next sixe,30778,2
30779,I gave t shirts to friend who wears XL & they fit her great.,30779,2
30780,"The top itself looked ok, it just didn't fit at all.",30780,2
30780,WAY TOO SMALL.,30780,2
30780,I have 36 D's.,30780,2
30780,Hope this helps.,30780,2
30781,Smaller would help to not look so cheap.,30781,2
30781,Would look better without all the metal that makes up necklace.,30781,2
30782,would have been beautiful if it had fit,30782,2
30783,I'm not really impressed.,30783,2
30783,Cheaply made.,30783,2
30783,"Just ""ok""",30783,2
30784,Not a one size fits all.,30784,2
30785,I wanted to love this but the fit is a bit to loose doesn't bring much support to you incision.,30785,2
30785,Folds at the top while wearing it.,30785,2
30786,I ordered these as part of a Halloween costume and need them for a party this weekend or I'd return them.,30786,2
30786,The color is significantly lighter than the picture (it's not a bad color but doesn't  really match what I'd intended it for).,30786,2
30786,"More importantly though, there was a staple sticking up into the sole of the boot which went directly into my heel when I tried it on.",30786,2
30787,It was too big  acording the size and the fabric is too thin and it definately looks cheep.,30787,2
30788,"I don't took a while to arrive, but this was expected and arrive before estimated delivery date.",30788,2
30788,"But, it is a poorly made rug the item looks ripped in one area.",30788,2
30788,I love the rug but I wouldn't buy it again.,30788,2
30789,Like em but they run real small.,30789,2
30789,Good reminder not to gain weight,30789,2
30790,It fell apart on my daughter after a week,30790,2
30791,I do not swim and thought this would be the perfect option to wear to the deep water aerobics class offered at my gym.,30791,2
30791,I have read that this vest runs a bit small due to the removable floats.,30791,2
30791,"It felt ""bulky"" to wear, but I thought that having the vest was a good trade off to feel confident in the water.",30791,2
30791,"Because I did size up, it fit fine.",30791,2
30791,The zipper however is another matter.,30791,2
30791,"The zipper is heavy duty, but plastic, which makes sense for use in the water.",30791,2
30791,I wore it at the house to get use to it and the zipper separated while zipped up.,30791,2
30791,"Fortunately, I was  able to remove the vest without damaging the zipper.",30791,2
30791,I thought that I may not have had the zipper completely seated and that is why that happened.,30791,2
30791,"I took it to the gym yesterday, was very careful to make sure the zipper was fully seated and zipped it up with no problems.",30791,2
30791,"I got in the pool and about 10 minutes into my class the zipper separated in the middle again, leaving me stuck in the vest and with the water getting into the open area, the vest billowed out.",30791,2
30791,The instructor was very nice and assisted me to get out of the vest without ruining the zipper.,30791,2
30791,"She ""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"" that I return the vest because with a defective zipper, I did not feel confident wearing it.",30791,2
30791,"Sadly, I had great plans to use this vest and take swim lessons.",30791,2
30791,I will use the Instructional Swim Belt that the pool has available for use in the classes.,30791,2
30791,Another plus of the Instructional Swim Belts are they are much easier to pack to take on a cruise to snorkel with and also cost less than $20.00.,30791,2
30791,I would NOT recommend this item.,30791,2
30791,** All reviews that I post are solely my own opinion on the products that I have purchased for use by my family and myself.,30791,2
30791,I/we have NOT been provided any products at a reduced fee or free of charge in exchange for a review.,30791,2
30791,I make this statement because one of the things that I like most about Amazon is to get feedback on a product that I am thinking about purchasing.,30791,2
30791,"With so many reviews now being written in exchange for getting the item for free or at a reduced price, I feel that some items are highly rated, with many reviews because of this.",30791,2
30792,I didn't like this item.,30792,2
30792,"It cam as two pieces and try as hard as I could, I couldn't make them stay on my foot and look the way it does in the picture.",30792,2
30792,I ended up giving them to my children who used them as necklaces for their barbies.,30792,2
30792,"It was inexpensive so no big deal, but I wouldn't recommended.",30792,2
30793,I returned this!,30793,2
30793,"It was super see through, and while I am usually fine with that, since I can add a cami or cute cage bra, nothing looked right with this top, because of the back.",30793,2
30793,"Also, it just didn't hang right.",30793,2
30793,"The back is quite heavy due to the lace detail, and because of the very light material of the front, it tends to ride up around the neckline.",30793,2
30793,It was really annoying.,30793,2
30793,"I normally can find really good qualities about everything I buy, and I really wanted to like this top because it really is super cute.",30793,2
30793,I just couldn't!,30793,2
30794,"We were going to a night at the museum event, and my son was begging me for this badge.",30794,2
30794,"He loves watching YouTube videos on Five Nights at Freddys, and he had seen a Freddy Fazbear badge advertised on one of the sites.",30794,2
30794,"So, I turned to Amazon, and of course I found this badge.",30794,2
30794,"Honestly, I wasn't sure that it would be worth $15, but as I received, I found that the badge appeared to be in good shape, and made with good quality metal.",30794,2
30794,It wasn't made with flimsy or cheap plastic.,30794,2
30794,"The badge attached to his shirt, and almost weighs down the cotton (it might be better to wear this badge with a more solid, stronger shirt or vest).",30794,2
30794,"The backing of the pen was easy to unhook and hook, and the clasp really hooks the pin in tight so it won't get loose or fall off of his shirt.",30794,2
30794,"The only thing I didn't like with the pin piece is that it is quite long, and the sharp metal pin would bother my son as he was wearing it.",30794,2
30794,"This part needs to be a little shorter, but other than that, my son is having a blast with this!",30794,2
30794,"4/16/16 UPDATE: I'm updating my review to say that while my son had fun with this pin, it only lasted 2 months!!",30794,2
30794,"The pin backing came off, and we're not able to hook it back on.",30794,2
30794,It's really disappointing that he can't continue to wear it.,30794,2
30794,"I guess this pin would be okay for a one time use at a birthday party or other event, but it's not going to last for kids wanting to continue to wear it/play with it.",30794,2
30794,Very disappointed!,30794,2
30794,!,30794,2
30795,"These are meant to be worn alone, not under a button up of any kind.",30795,2
30795,The sleeves are very long for short sleeve.,30795,2
30795,I am 6'4 and 260 lbs.,30795,2
30795,the sleeves come past my elbow.,30795,2
30796,The top is to tight.,30796,2
30796,Does not have much give.,30796,2
30797,Bought it for a gift.,30797,2
30797,Bracelet broke after it was worn three times.,30797,2
30798,Looks quite cheap!,30798,2
30798,would never recommend this.,30798,2
30799,Fit much smaller then expected.,30799,2
30799,"Picked a 2xl so it would be baggy, no such luck.",30799,2
30800,"This item is crazy small, I could not even pull it up over my hips.",30800,2
30800,It is also not as nicely made as the one in the picture.,30800,2
30800,"The bow was missing, the fabric felt stiff, the lace was not trimmed well where the straps attached, and the front hem went straight across, not the pretty curve as pictured.",30800,2
30800,"However, I think the product was what I should have expected based on the price.",30800,2
30800,"The customer service from this company was exceptional, far beyond what expected.",30800,2
30800,"If you do buy it, make sure to order a minimum of 2-3 sizes up from your normal US sizing.",30800,2
30801,I purchased according to the size chart and they Are a size to small.,30801,2
30801,"This is my second pair but a different style, and the first pair was ok.",30801,2
30802,Too big,30802,2
30803,Not very good quality but it's a hat.,30803,2
30804,somewhat small,30804,2
30805,"Such a cute dress and it looks exactly like advertised, but the chest was to short and small and i wasn't able to fit the chest at all.",30805,2
30806,It's cute but way shorter than the picture,30806,2
30807,Very short.,30807,2
30807,"More of a tunic, not a dress.",30807,2
30808,Broke in one week /:,30808,2
30809,These fit way to small and since the legs and crotch are open they rotate real easy around your waist so they always are on me crooked.,30809,2
30810,Each slot is so small and tight I have to fight to get a single credit card in.,30810,2
30810,I was extremely disappointed.,30810,2
30811,"they are comfortable, however, very fragile - wore them once and it has a run in it",30811,2
30812,No good,30812,2
30813,This is a cute dress however there are issues with it.,30813,2
30813,The cord has frayed ends and the proportions are off (small along the bust; stitching along arm openings do not lay flat).,30813,2
30813,Based on reading other reviews there appear to be inconsistencies with quality.,30813,2
30814,Another shirt I bought and cannot wear!,30814,2
30814,The bottom is snug and shows my tummy bulge (pregnant) too much.,30814,2
30814,It is not loose and flowy at all,30814,2
30815,DIdnt like them after I put lens in.,30815,2
30816,pretty but looks like a big bag on you,30816,2
30817,Sent it back.,30817,2
30817,Too large and not as cute in person.,30817,2
30818,"The picture matched up with ""eclectic blue"" does not match the actual pattern at all.",30818,2
30818,"I was expecting the black and white design in the image (I guess I thought the black might actually be blue, explaining the name.",30818,2
30818,I would have been ok with it if it had been this design in blue).,30818,2
30818,"Instead, the umbrella I got is black with a dark blue paisley design.",30818,2
30818,"It's not my favorite, but not worth returning.",30818,2
30819,I originally bought the 10.5 R 115 Mini-Mil as I was interested in a real light weight boot.,30819,2
30819,I wear 10.5R in several styles of older military Belleville boots made in the USA and love them.,30819,2
30819,"However, these 115 boots turned out to be made in China (that is on the label inside), not the USA and they are made on a VERY different form (last) than any other Belleville boots I have owned.",30819,2
30819,"When they arrived, it was clear the 10.5 size was much smaller than the other Belleville boots plus the front foot pocket is far wider.",30819,2
30819,"I spent the $20 bucks postage to return them and the $16 bucks postage to have them replaced with a size 11, a size larger than I have never worn.",30819,2
30819,The seller was good with that.,30819,2
30819,"However, even the 11s are a bit short at the toe compared to the other 10.5s - toe bang going down hill and they have an even wider in the front pocket.",30819,2
30819,I'm simply going to give the to the local thrift store and stay with the USA made ones.,30819,2
30819,I have posted a picture of my 10.5R USA Belleville boots next to these 11R 115 Belleville boots and you can see the larger front and the fact that the 11s in the Mini-Mil are still a bit shorter.,30819,2
30819,The good news is they are very light and have a good lace system.,30819,2
30819,However I would not suggest buying these on line and expecting them to fit like other Belleville mil boots.,30819,2
30819,"Also, they do NOT look like the darker brown in the picture.",30819,2
30819,I asked the company about that and the coyote color is tan at best - much lighter than the picture.,30819,2
30820,Wasn't happy with it.,30820,2
30821,"I loved it, but way to small.",30821,2
30821,"In order to wear this the way it is supposed to fit, you need to wear size small (possibly medium) in your normal clothing.",30821,2
30822,Nice dress but too small,30822,2
30823,too big maybe order smaller,30823,2
30824,Color and size,30824,2
30825,No good.,30825,2
30825,"They are comfortable/breathable, not as baggy as a lot of people made them sound.",30825,2
30825,i expected them to barely touch my legs and they definitely do.,30825,2
30825,i don't have skinny thighs or calves but all the reviewers made them sound like they would be bigger than the average large.,30825,2
30825,They slide down too much for my liking.,30825,2
30825,Definitely not a gym pant definitely only wear for sleep or lounge.,30825,2
30826,"I wanted to love these, but I don't.",30826,2
30826,The fabric is very thin and shinny.,30826,2
30826,It snags easy and the inside of the thigh area pills when my thighs rub.,30826,2
30826,I would not purchase these again.,30826,2
30827,Was expecting them to be oversized and they weren't,30827,2
30828,Smaller than I expected.,30828,2
30829,Arrived as promised.,30829,2
30829,"However those earrings couldn't stay on my ears as ""crawlers"", I have returned them.",30829,2
30830,"Good cover-up, but cheaply made in India with vegetable dyes... You have to HAND WASH & DRIP-DRY--It is 100% cotton with dye that bleeds horribly.",30830,2
30830,"I have hand washed twice now, and it is STILL hemorrhaging dye!",30830,2
30831,"Not completely unwearable, but I sent it back.",30831,2
30831,The material is different than the photo.,30831,2
30831,It's less of a vibrant pink and it's chiffon instead.,30831,2
30831,"The bottoms were too full for my taste and are like a skort instead (skirt in front, shorts in back).",30831,2
30831,Seeing as I'm no longer 5 years old I wasn't a fan.,30831,2
30831,Photo is more flattering than it looks in person,30831,2
30832,sleeves were too short,30832,2
30833,"The bag itself is ok, not bad for the price.",30833,2
30833,My issue is the hardware.,30833,2
30833,It appears silver or pewter.,30833,2
30833,"In fact it is bright shinny gold
and that cheapens the look.",30833,2
30833,I think I will return it or try to sell it if I have to pay for return shipping.,30833,2
30834,"Hubby couldn't fit his 3 cards, license and paper money in.",30834,2
30834,"Too small, we sent it back.",30834,2
30835,Much smaller than size ordered,30835,2
30836,I wasn't happy with the style and quality of this product.,30836,2
30836,"I wouldn't of purchased this product if the first line read ""does not fit iPhone with a case made poorly"".",30836,2
30837,I was literally jumping with joy when I came across this item online.,30837,2
30837,"It looked like the perfect swimsuit to hide those flaws, especially the tummy area.",30837,2
30837,"Since this prouduct seems to be made by a company outside of the U.S., the sizing is different then the U.S.",30837,2
30837,I read a bunch of the reviews and decided to order a size up then I normally wear.,30837,2
30837,I probably should've ordered my normal size.,30837,2
30837,"The item took longer than normal to arrive, but I expected that based on other reviews.",30837,2
30837,The swimsuit is made out of a shiny black material.,30837,2
30837,The bust area is filled with super hard cups...not comfortable.,30837,2
30837,"To me, it was one of those that looks better on the hanger, then on the body.",30837,2
30837,This suit is made for women with a larger chest size..,30837,2
30837,I think it would be a perfect fit then.,30837,2
30838,"Cute bonnet, but it's coming apart at the seam in the back.",30838,2
30838,It's also smaller than expected.,30838,2
30839,"Poor quality of material, so lightly.",30839,2
30840,I wear a size xl I ordered xxl and this vest was still too small.,30840,2
30841,very cheap.,30841,2
30842,Looks nothing like the picture.,30842,2
30842,"It's too short, reaching my mid calves and the sleeve is wide and shapeless and also short.",30842,2
30842,Not even 3/4.,30842,2
30842,Definitely not worth the money,30842,2
30843,"Super cute,but way too short and small for my son.",30843,2
30843,He outgrew these in about a month.,30843,2
30843,"I bought them for him when was around 12 months old,and I ordered a size bigger.",30843,2
30844,"Came without a tag, it was cut off.",30844,2
30844,Sleeves are too short in length & style (looks nothin like the photo).,30844,2
30844,Over all this M fits okay except the arms are too short.,30844,2
30844,And the shoulder part bunches up.,30844,2
30845,Am I 5 years old???,30845,2
30845,"I ordered a large, I am 5'5 115.",30845,2
30845,This bathing suit stole my heart with its vibrant colors and graphics.,30845,2
30845,When I pulled it out of the bag I knew I was doomed!!!!!,30845,2
30845,When I ordered it I didn't expect much from the bottoms.,30845,2
30845,I knew chances are my booty would spill out.,30845,2
30845,"BUT, the top and the bottoms were, like....no.",30845,2
30845,Hahaha.,30845,2
30845,Thats what I get to for trying to buy a bathing suit online.,30845,2
30845,I have learned my lesson!,30845,2
30845,But still.,30845,2
30845,so cute if you're reeeeeeeeeeeally petite.,30845,2
30845,Or if you are a child.,30845,2
30846,This is a cute shirt but unfortunately it runs very small.,30846,2
30846,"If you have a large bust, buy at least one size bigger!",30846,2
30846,Other than that the quality was good especially for the price.,30846,2
30847,Material is cheap....you can see through it.,30847,2
30847,The design is beautiful...but just know to order a few sizes up and you might have to have it lined...,30847,2
30848,Very think material and a bit small,30848,2
30849,It is too tiny.,30849,2
30850,Thinner material than expected.,30850,2
30850,Sleeves kinda short.,30850,2
30850,Shrunk allot in length even without drying in dryer.,30850,2
30850,Overall disappointed.,30850,2
30851,This belly ring is flexible and comfortable.,30851,2
30851,"I rated it so low because the heart fell off after one day, pretty disappointing.",30851,2
30851,I'm 6 months now and fits fine,30851,2
30852,"Fit as expected, really cute, but it had stains on the skirt so I had to send it back.",30852,2
30853,First time mom?,30853,2
30853,Don't get this one.,30853,2
30853,The seams are impossibly brutal on nursing mamas.,30853,2
30854,The only reason I give this bathing suit a two star rating is because it simply just did not fit me.,30854,2
30854,I am extremely top heavy when I tried the suit on even though u couldn't really see it the part that was to cover your breast only covered about half of mine.,30854,2
30854,And the bottom of the suit was just too big on me ;( .,30854,2
30854,The swim suit itself seemed like very good quality but again I won't be wearing a swim suit this year.,30854,2
30855,WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT A GIRL'S SIZE LARGE.,30855,2
30856,I wanted to like it...I really did but the necklace felt like a fancy toy for little girls.,30856,2
30856,"It was not as heavy as I was hoping for, the stone looks odd and it didn't really seem like the type of jewelry I would wear at 30.",30856,2
30856,The stone does not actually look like stone.,30856,2
30856,I did not like it for myself.,30856,2
30856,"Although, the chain itself and what was around the stones was very nice...it just wasn't for me.",30856,2
30857,Broke the first day.,30857,2
30858,"Very cheap... Beautiful rings, but three ring have broken and I only had the chance to wear each once.",30858,2
30858,Love the braclet though!,30858,2
30859,Very ordinary looking and ill fitting robe.,30859,2
30859,Returning it.,30859,2
30860,Way to small,30860,2
30861,Its cute but the sizechart you have didn't work for me.,30861,2
30861,Shirt came it atleast 3 sizes smaller than what your sizechart showed.,30861,2
30862,"Thin material,
top too small.",30862,2
30863,"Not what I expected, disappointed in the quality",30863,2
30864,Not true to size marked,30864,2
30865,"if your kids wears a backpack , this will not do a good job covering you kid and their back pack.",30865,2
30865,but i loved how clear it was.,30865,2
30865,i only gave it 2 stars because parts of their backpack where wet by the time we got to school.,30865,2
30865,I ended up buy a regular umbrella.,30865,2
30866,I got a medium and there both to big im a 34b in top and a 4  in bottoms  and weigh 130 and the bikini is to big :( order a size small it will fit better!!,30866,2
30866,!,30866,2
30867,Think this is a product that you intentionally needed to go down a size in in effort for it to fit like the model.,30867,2
30867,I'm usually a small but feel like I should've gotten the XS.,30867,2
30868,Didn't fit like I expected.,30868,2
30869,"This looks so cute in the picture, but I think I may have received something that someone else had returned.",30869,2
30869,There were threads hanging from several places.,30869,2
30869,I had to send it back.,30869,2
30870,This top is thinner and smaller than expected.,30870,2
30870,The quality is less than I prefer.,30870,2
30871,"I just sent this back because it is definitely NOT one size fits all, not even most.",30871,2
30871,It may fit up to size 6.,30871,2
30872,These inserts didn't do it for me.,30872,2
30872,The arch support is too light.,30872,2
30872,They help a bit but not much.,30872,2
30873,its itchy,30873,2
30874,Fit is small for a XXL..Print is cute.,30874,2
30875,"looks cheap, get what you pay for, much shorter than picture",30875,2
30876,Gave it to a friend who is 6 inches shorter and 50 pounds lighter than me.,30876,2
30876,She loves it.,30876,2
30876,I reordered a larger size.,30876,2
30877,Arms are to tight..,30877,2
30878,These fit great BUT the jewels on the strap came off very quickly and after about 3 weeks the entire sole of one shoe fell right off.,30878,2
30878,Luckily my daughter could still make it home.,30878,2
30878,I can't recommend these to be worn more than three times.,30878,2
30879,It was a great belt for 6 months.,30879,2
30879,Then the black center of the buckle broke off exposing the inner components.,30879,2
30879,The center of piece is only attached at 4 points of fairly weak metal about 3mm wide.,30879,2
30879,"Once the inner parts were exposed, the spring mechanism came apart, locking the belt without a way to undo it short of a screen Driver.",30879,2
30879,Removing the belt ended up tearing the leather part all apart.,30879,2
30879,"Contacted the seller and the were great and sent me a new buckle, though they did require me to send them a picture of it first.",30879,2
30879,"I wish I'd thought to tell them that the leather part was damaged as well because it now looked like crap, but at least it still worked.",30879,2
30879,"6 months later, the spring mechanism fell apart, again locking the belt in place.",30879,2
30879,I ripped it off and threw it in the trash.,30879,2
30879,"Their customer service is good as they replaced the buckle free of charge, however I'd say the quality is simply subpar with regards to the buckle.",30879,2
30879,I bought a similar belt made by Vbiger and it seems to be a lot sturdier.,30879,2
30879,Hopefully this one lasts longer.,30879,2
30880,Cute but poor quality.,30880,2
30880,"You get what you pay for, lesson learned.",30880,2
30880,Snap does not close and cards drop down in slots too far to grab them.,30880,2
30880,Would not buy again.,30880,2
30881,The color is a different lavender than pictured.,30881,2
30881,The blouse I received is a tacky color and is too large.,30881,2
30881,The craftsmanship is poor as well.,30881,2
30881,The inside seams have many loose threads.,30881,2
30881,I don't think you get what you pay for in this case.,30881,2
30882,Pretty but snags on everything.,30882,2
30883,Meh.,30883,2
30883,Looks like a softer material in the photo.,30883,2
30883,It's thin and see through.,30883,2
30883,I will wear it as a pajama top.,30883,2
30884,"too small,, waste of money",30884,2
30885,I ordered this to wear at my gender reveal party because it appears pink and blue.,30885,2
30885,"However, it was all pink except for a tiny line of blue at the edge.",30885,2
30886,It was great until the seam started to come off the stitches were coming unloosed,30886,2
30887,too small,30887,2
30888,"Took forever to get here, when it did I wasn't surprised, it's from China don't look as nice as the pic and is very small in the waist.. Material is strong though",30888,2
30889,Drab and too large!,30889,2
30889,It is hard to know what the size will be when it is coming overseas.,30889,2
30890,Piece of crap.,30890,2
30890,Barely fit my finger.,30890,2
30890,I got a size 7 and I'm usually a size 6 and it also broke after a few days.,30890,2
30890,2 starts because it's cute,30890,2
30891,very short,30891,2
30892,Cute style but normally wear small/medium - and this fit like large/xl - it's going back.,30892,2
30892,It did have a weirdish texture as well.,30892,2
30893,It didn't fit me so i gave it to my sister,30893,2
30894,Terrible quality.,30894,2
30894,Fell apart after first use.,30894,2
30894,Straps are much flimsier than in the picture.,30894,2
30894,Would recommend buying something a little more expensive and sturdy.,30894,2
30895,"Too tight in the bust for a weight lifter, cute graphic",30895,2
30896,"The small disk on the end of each of these nose rings is very awkward, you have to put the hoop through your nose on the INSIDE which I found to be very time consuming and difficult.",30896,2
30896,"These are also the gage size that a piercer would use, not the size that you switch to after it heals, it was uncomfortable to wear a gage that was larger.",30896,2
30896,"I did read on the description the gage size, but even after wearing them for 3 days it became too painful and I took it out.",30896,2
30896,Just keep in mind that awkward piece of metal they put on one side before you buy these.,30896,2
30897,NOT MADE FOR AMERICAN WOMEN.,30897,2
30897,SIZING NOT USA STANDAED,30897,2
30898,Ordered Large but came Too small....need American sizes please...large=large,30898,2
30899,It broke before I ever got to wear it.,30899,2
30900,The first pair I bought for my son broke within a couple weeks,30900,2
30901,Nice looking but is not an extra large.,30901,2
30902,Not so much.,30902,2
30903,"This swing top was not heathered as pictured, but I overlooked that, and kept it.",30903,2
30903,"However, upon cold washing it, the seams on the front and back now appear twisted diagonally.",30903,2
30903,It is a house shirt only at this point because I cannot wear it anywhere else.,30903,2
30904,Dress is beautiful but runs small,30904,2
30905,These fit really funny.,30905,2
30905,They are too big in the waistband and too small in the butt.,30905,2
30905,I have briefs in the same size and they fit nothing alike.,30905,2
30906,I am a 32 C and ordered the C cup..,30906,2
30906,"I should of went with a D.. after sticking and unstickng a dozen times to get it the way i wanted, some of the sticky part crumbled off..",30906,2
30906,I also felt like it was too heavy..,30906,2
30907,These run small.,30907,2
30907,X Large isn't even close to extra large.,30907,2
30907,More like a ladies 16.,30907,2
30908,"Super, super cheap.",30908,2
30908,They break quickly.,30908,2
30908,Good as a party favor or for a weekend away when you don't want to bring your expensive sunglasses.,30908,2
30909,Very disappointed in sizing - Chinese sizing very small or got dud.,30909,2
30909,Either way - super thin material and very tight.,30909,2
30910,It is a Metal stamping.,30910,2
30910,Really I'd say worth about 7 dollars.,30910,2
30910,"They are probably making a pot load of money off this since, like I say it's a metal stamping with open seams.",30910,2
30910,It no doubt will do what it is supposed to and too it really doesn't look that bad.,30910,2
30910,If you really needed a wallet and only had 18 dollars probably a good purchase.,30910,2
30910,Don't sit on it.,30910,2
30911,Metal parts rusted after wearing a few times.,30911,2
30912,"not at all off shoulder, would need to up the size maybe even 2.",30912,2
30913,I bought a womens XL  I guess I should have paid attention to the price.,30913,2
30913,You get what you pay for and it's a 4.99 shirt for sure.,30913,2
30913,"The seams have strings hanging from them, the size is more a small and mid-drif shirt.",30913,2
30913,It's just ... silly.,30913,2
30914,This is a cute shirt.,30914,2
30914,I'm glad I ordered 1 size up....even then the arms/chest are almost too tight.,30914,2
30914,Update: This shirt ripped next to the seem before I could even wear it.,30914,2
30914,I had already washed it so I couldn't return it and it wasn't something that could be fixed easily....it would probably cost more to fix it then to just buy a new one.,30914,2
30914,"It went into the trash which makes me sad--it was really cute, but cheap material/construction.",30914,2
30915,I do not think item is worth the price.,30915,2
30915,Cheap fabric and cheaply made.,30915,2
30915,In the picture it appears to have fins with it but it does not.,30915,2
30916,"Disappointed, cheap  material and comes very small",30916,2
30917,"They were way too small, I am returning for a refund.",30917,2
30918,"Honestly, it's cheap looking and I gave it to the neighbors little girl for her dress-up box.",30918,2
30919,I'm a little disappointed in these two items...I bought two of these in the same size (large) different colors  (white & mint).,30919,2
30919,The white was too small and the mint too big.,30919,2
30920,Ordered a medium  should have ordered x large,30920,2
30921,Really big and cheap,30921,2
30922,The glasses are cute.,30922,2
30922,"However, the *legs are also plastic?",30922,2
30922,I can see them peeling with use.,30922,2
30922,I feel these glasses are over priced.,30922,2
30923,For starters this is a swimsuit cover up NOT a dress.,30923,2
30923,It is COMPLETELY see through and does not look like the pictures at all.,30923,2
30923,It makes a cute swimsuit coverup just not a cute dress,30923,2
30924,I think I would really like this yoga top but too small.,30924,2
30924,All through ordering on line.,30924,2
30925,The dress was sewn crooked.,30925,2
30925,Poor construction.,30925,2
30926,This fabric is so thin.,30926,2
30926,I will only wear it around the house.,30926,2
30926,"Also, I'm 5'3, and the M skirt is a little short.",30926,2
30926,I wear it low on my waist to make it the right length.,30926,2
30926,"After being washed 3 times, it's looking a little aged already.",30926,2
30927,Waistband is large and the pants are short,30927,2
30928,The seam in the skirt came apart while at work.,30928,2
30928,This dress is not very well made - stitching had to be repaired in several places.,30928,2
30928,I liked what it looked like until everyone got a show.,30928,2
30929,in the description this shawl is supposed to be navy blue.,30929,2
30929,It is more of a peacock blue.,30929,2
30929,I bought it to wear with a navy gown.,30929,2
30929,I had to return it.,30929,2
30929,Absolutely NOT navy!,30929,2
30929,!,30929,2
30930,just not the right fit for me.,30930,2
30930,Bust too tight and the sleeves way to puffy!,30930,2
30931,"If I had seen this in person first, I wouldn't have bought it.",30931,2
30931,"Thin and looked cheap, also not as soft as I hoped.",30931,2
30932,"Pouch is huge, guess it would hold a fupa.",30932,2
30933,"It is a nice jacket, however it is very small.",30933,2
30933,I normally wear a 2x and I got this a 4x and it was way too small.,30933,2
30933,I was sad because I really liked the style.,30933,2
30934,"The dress is cute, but not well made.",30934,2
30934,I ordered 2 dresses and both have issues.,30934,2
30934,One dress is sewn crooked.,30934,2
30934,One armhole is bigger than the other.,30934,2
30934,The second dress has a whole in the tool where it was not seen properly.,30934,2
30934,"With that said, the fabric on the top is so soft.",30934,2
30935,could not get the back off.,30935,2
30936,It's see-through & not as cute on as it is in the pic :(,30936,2
30937,This necklace took well over 4 weeks to get.,30937,2
30937,"It is cute and I do like it, however it was wrapped against a white little sleeve and it was turning green.",30937,2
30937,I could tell that the actual necklace is not that nice.,30937,2
30937,It was rusting basically on this white sleeve.,30937,2
30937,I have not yet worn it in fear it might turn my neck green where the chain sits.,30937,2
30937,:(,30937,2
30938,"Color is the same as posted but have a very short torso and shirt made that more prominent, also does not wear the same on the shoulders as expected.",30938,2
30938,"Material was very soft and thin good for summer, will be keeping product.",30938,2
30939,Quality of material was poor.,30939,2
30940,This is the second purchase I made of a similar chain.,30940,2
30940,I had ordered the first one not realizing how short it would be around my neck and was disappointed in the spring clasp.,30940,2
30940,So I ordered this one in a longer length and with a lobster claw clasp.,30940,2
30940,"I was OK with the length, but the clasp is so small and cheaply done that I am certain it will break just like the last one.",30940,2
30940,"The cain itself is lovely, too bad that will not last due to the clasp!",30940,2
30941,very cheap quality and arrived extremely wrinkled.,30941,2
30941,I would have returned but I missed the return cut off date.,30941,2
30942,White fades very quickly,30942,2
30943,"Top was WAY too small, so gave it to my daughter in law who's a bit smaller than I and it fit her perfectly; but then fell apart after the first cleaning.",30943,2
30943,oy!,30943,2
30944,Unfortunately this costume did not fit me.,30944,2
30944,I am too tall (I am 5'7) and I found the bottom of the costume riding up way too high so if you're a tall girl please beware of this.,30944,2
30944,Loved the color of the costume and material however it was also missing a button.,30944,2
30944,You can tell a button was once attached in the front however there was no button in the package.,30944,2
30945,I got so many complements but it was too small so I had to take it off,30945,2
30946,"It was so dull, none of it sparkled.",30946,2
30946,The earrings were beawutiful but this stone part was bad.,30946,2
30946,I am going to have to rewturn it.,30946,2
30946,So sorry.,30946,2
30946,I was so disappointed.,30946,2
30947,You need to size up at least twice.,30947,2
30947,Nice blouse though.,30947,2
30947,Size chart inaccurate.,30947,2
30947,Other than that very pretty.,30947,2
30947,Rated 2 stars because size is really off.,30947,2
30948,Love the design but even though it was a 4X it still was too small for me (I normally wear a US 1x),30948,2
30949,Did not like the netting on inside,30949,2
30950,Way way too small!,30950,2
30950,Nicely made but not for the average size woman.,30950,2
30951,I bought as a gift for my oldest nephew.,30951,2
30951,"He's over 6 feet, but thin.",30951,2
30951,The large is too small for him and I need to exchange.,30951,2
30951,"He always wear a large, so you may want to go up a size when ordering.",30951,2
30952,I really disliked this necklace.,30952,2
30952,I found the pictures to be misleading.,30952,2
30952,"In one photo, the flowers look smaller and very pretty while in the next photo they are huge.",30952,2
30952,In reality and in my opinion- the flowers are huge and unattractive to wear as a necklace.,30952,2
30952,The chain is also too short for me.,30952,2
30952,Dissatisfied overall.,30952,2
30953,Too nylon feelin.,30953,2
30953,Made hips look huge.,30953,2
30954,The metal parts where the multiple strands come together are sharp and hurt my wrist.,30954,2
30955,Not made good,30955,2
30956,Doesn't fit my features well,30956,2
30957,"THIS hat is what they call ""very large""?",30957,2
30957,"It seems to be rather small, no bigger than medium at the most.",30957,2
30957,These hats must be imported from some country where all the people have exceptionally small heads.,30957,2
30957,A shame.,30957,2
30957,The color was nice.,30957,2
30958,Cute but runs small.,30958,2
30958,Order 2 sizes up.,30958,2
30959,crap,30959,2
30960,"Very sheer, wrinkles easily, cut very small",30960,2
30961,Ordered large size after reading the reviews that order one size up .,30961,2
30961,Still it didn't fit .,30961,2
30961,I wasted my money .,30961,2
30962,for an extra large it is way to small you could not wear it with a shirt under it,30962,2
30963,When I saw this outfit I fell in love with it but it runs  too small....,30963,2
30963,I give I to my daughter,30963,2
30964,I got it in plus size... it's a shirt on me instead of a dress.....,30964,2
30965,"I ordered this shirt for my son to wear for Easter, and I loved the color, however it did Not come with the pocket hanky that was described in the description and there was a hole in the front of the shirt close to the seam but still noticeable.",30965,2
30965,"I attached a picture of it, it looks almost like a cigarette  burn but could have been from and iron of some sort I guess.",30965,2
30965,It didn't have a smoke smell but the burn was there non the less.,30965,2
30966,The elastic part was too tight on my son.,30966,2
30966,We purchased 2 different sizes to compare and the bigger size was too long for his feet.,30966,2
30966,Maybe my son has wide heels or something but after just a few minutes of putting them on there were little red marks/indents around his ankle and heel area.,30966,2
30966,We are also trying to find a pair of shoes he is comfortable wearing as he hates wearing shoes and these did not work for us.,30966,2
30966,Otherwise the leather material and soles were nice and customer service was very accommodating and easy to work with.,30966,2
30967,Disappointed,30967,2
30968,"Comfortable,  scoop neck too big",30968,2
30969,Arm holes too small.,30969,2
30970,Baggy and not flattering.,30970,2
30971,Poor quality.,30971,2
30971,I will be returning it,30971,2
30972,"If you have a ""pooch"" this is not the dress for you.",30972,2
30972,It resembles a maternity dress and the cut of the neck of the dress is awkward.,30972,2
30972,Maybe a darker color would have worked better but this didn't work for me =\,30972,2
30973,Looks much higher quality in the pics than it actually is.,30973,2
30973,The seams are wavy and thick and don't lay right when I'm wearing it.,30973,2
30973,It's my lounge around the house sweater now.,30973,2
30974,Graphic is to low on fabric,30974,2
30975,"Lengthwise, this was about what I expected.",30975,2
30975,"But it was far too narrow in the shoulders and the sleeves were a very tight fit, even after I ordered a size up to an XL.",30975,2
30975,I felt a bit like meat in a sausage casing.,30975,2
30975,Not quite the look I was going for.,30975,2
30975,"The fabric itself is very lovely but a bit sheer, so bear that in mind.",30975,2
30975,"The applique is not attached all the firmly, but given the item's low price, I wasn't particularly fussed; you get what you pay for and my expectations weren't all that high.",30975,2
30975,But a word to the wise: order TWO sizes up!,30975,2
30975,And if a size up is an XL for you (like me!,30975,2
30975,"), skip this garment.",30975,2
30976,It is a great idea for a tiny dog but it is poorly made and of cheap materials.,30976,2
30976,"Also, the sizing is too small.",30976,2
30976,I wouldn't recommend it.,30976,2
30977,Felt very cheap and weren't comfortable.,30977,2
30977,I ended up returning them.,30977,2
30978,Too shear and material not what I expected...!Very disappointed !,30978,2
30979,poor quality,30979,2
30980,Very cute until you look at fabric in the bottom feature.,30980,2
30980,"It does not appear as solid a pattern as shown, so does not go with rest of style.",30980,2
30980,"Not top grade quality, but would have made a smart layered look piece but for that feature.",30980,2
30980,I put it in the Goodwill bag,30980,2
30981,I had to return it.,30981,2
30981,"Disappointed that it felt tight across the back, but most annoying to me was the crackling plastic sound every time I moved.",30981,2
30981,"Probably doesn't bother most people, but it felt cheap.",30981,2
30981,I'll keep on looking for the right jacket.,30981,2
30981,"I'm 5'2, 115, and the jacket LOOKED good, but no way could I wear a sweater underneath.",30981,2
30982,Was gift.,30982,2
30982,Friend returned to me after band tore first time worn.,30982,2
30982,Band looked & felt like paper.,30982,2
30982,"She decided to keep watch dial, & I will find another band.",30982,2
30983,One size does not fit all.,30983,2
30983,If you are over 6' these will not lengthen to the height you need.,30983,2
30984,"My son asked for a wooden bowtie for a fun, casual look.",30984,2
30984,"When I saw the magnet connection, I thought it would work well and be equally quirky.",30984,2
30984,I completely missed the fact that the magnet wouldn't make a good connection over the button on the oxford.,30984,2
30984,"HUGE oversight on my part, but worse for product development to miss this.",30984,2
30984,"Useless, unless you wear a bowtie on a t-shirt.",30984,2
30985,It's not very well made.,30985,2
30985,"Been wearing it a day or two a week for a few months, and the hole i use is already stretched halfway to the next one.",30985,2
30985,Buckles are also wearing badly.,30985,2
30985,Can't recommend.,30985,2
30986,It's just okay.,30986,2
30986,The material is soft but this provides no support.,30986,2
30986,Not even the light support you would expect to receive from a tank.,30986,2
30986,I bought this to use when I am home instead of using a nursing bra but I still need to wear a bursing bra with this.,30986,2
30987,I ordered a size larger than normal because it was listed as small.,30987,2
30987,But its still small.,30987,2
30987,Its more sized appropriately for girls.,30987,2
30988,Both of the clips were for the right ear only.,30988,2
30989,Cheap and does not glow like the picture suggests.,30989,2
30990,"The quality of this skirt was fine, but the description online is off.",30990,2
30990,"It looks like a normal, everyday wear skirt in the photo, but it is actually a ballet skirt.",30990,2
30990,"If you choose to order this, note that it is see-through (for ballet).",30990,2
30991,The straps on this are BIZARRELY long.,30991,2
30992,I really liked the pattern.,30992,2
30992,The length is shorter than most scrub tops.,30992,2
30992,The fabric is thin.,30992,2
30992,It tore easily when I was holding a dog at my job (vet tech) and his nail went right through it.,30992,2
30993,It's so short that the slit goes half way up your rear end.,30993,2
30993,"It's more of a tunic shirt length than a dress length, and I have a really short torso.",30993,2
30993,I can't even wear it with leggings because my rear end literally hangs out.,30993,2
30993,I liked the top though.,30993,2
30993,If they made it a shirt or like a foot longer it'd have been perfect.,30993,2
30994,So small will fit American girl doll!,30994,2
30995,Too small - not flowy like photo,30995,2
30996,stunk and too easy to tear.,30996,2
30997,Not as cute as picture.,30997,2
30998,"Somehow too short even for me (I'm 5 3"") it fell to my ankle...I bought the Small and it was also very tight, which was unexpected as I usually wear a size 0/2; anyways I could have lived with that BUT the dress is completely sheer both the top part and the skirt, no under skirt whatsoever, I will be returning as I cannot wear this as is... :(",30998,2
30999,Very flimsy,30999,2
31000,This is a men's style shirt; which I never have a problem with the fit when I wear them.,31000,2
31000,"But the torso was a little smaller than I expected, and the sleeves were way too big.",31000,2
31000,It looks really funky and I don't like it.,31000,2
31000,"I'll either have to cut the sleeves off and make it into a muscle tee,  return it and buy the women's style, or buy a completely different shirt.",31000,2
31001,"Really cute, really soft long length leggings.",31001,2
31001,"I'm 5'9"" and a size 10/12, and these fit perfectly.",31001,2
31001,"Unfortunately, they ripped from the knee of the legging out the first time I wore them.",31001,2
31001,"I'm guessing there must have been a hole or a snag, and when a squatted down to pick something up the split from the knee out in either direction.",31001,2
31001,"Disappointing, they were super cute for the 5 minutes I got to wear them!",31001,2
31002,"Unfortunately this dress it's of course made out of cheap materials and the size is inaccurate, plus the cup size stays as small, my girlfriend is a 34DD and i got a large, barely covered 60% of her bust, and the rest of the dress was too stretched.",31002,2
31002,I returned the dress.,31002,2
31003,It looks nothing like the picture,31003,2
31004,"it is a lot smaller than any of the others That I bought , It will have to go to the senior store",31004,2
31005,"This purse is nice as far as the purse goes, however, the zipper is complete garbage.",31005,2
31005,It splits open in the middle when it's zipped shut.,31005,2
31005,They must have used the cheapest zipper they could.,31005,2
31005,No quality at all.,31005,2
31006,"I am not a fan of Patty Boutik stuff, too synthetic...",31006,2
31007,Item broke after a few uses.,31007,2
31008,"Not suggested, does not fit my woman as described",31008,2
31009,"The center main ring is okay, but the two outer bands did not last more than a few days before the stones started to fall out.",31009,2
31009,I am just wearing the main ring without the other bands since I like the heart shaped stone.,31009,2
31010,"I really can't complain for the price paid, but the biggest issue is that the elastic used around the leg openings and the top are extremely poor quality.",31010,2
31010,It doesn't give or stretch at all.,31010,2
31010,"So unless you have a straight figure, it doesn't ""give"" around your curves as you put it on - something king of important with a one-piece that you have to slide up over your hips.",31010,2
31010,"I wouldn't buy it again, even though it's cute, because the elastic will be doe after a single wearing.",31010,2
31011,"WELL TAILORED BUT SMALL ;/
XL fits like a size 8 not a 12",31011,2
31012,"The length is too short for me and I'm only 5'2"".",31012,2
31013,Not bad,31013,2
31014,Hate the material,31014,2
31015,When put on this product it's hard for him to walk on it.,31015,2
31016,I am very disappointed......The display picture is much cuter than the actual product.,31016,2
31016,I have read all the positive and negative reviews before I made my decision to give it a try anyways.,31016,2
31016,"Well, the actual item was not like the picture showing...",31016,2
31016,The cat`s face was really low....,31016,2
31016,"I didn`t like the proportion of it:(  Probably you could do better by making it yourself from local craft store.... the price was cheap, this is what you will get... Chain is ~12inch long, okay length for me.",31016,2
31017,Fit is as expected.,31017,2
31017,Quality is somewhat disappointing.,31017,2
31017,Material in the sleeves and back is very thin and shear.,31017,2
31017,You can basically see through it.,31017,2
31017,"Also, the cuffs are very basic, like a regular long sleeve shirt.",31017,2
31017,They are not the fold over cuffs.,31017,2
31017,Would not recommend this shirt.,31017,2
31018,Fits tight as a smaller size,31018,2
31019,fits weird and too short.,31019,2
31019,Won't cover top of nipples.,31019,2
31019,";)

Edited to add that the seller offered to refund me if I gave the suit a 5 star rating.",31019,2
31019,"That bribe may have worked on some of the other reviewers, which may be why the rating is so high.",31019,2
31019,"But, I'm sticking to my original rating plus one star just because the color is nice.",31019,2
31019,I feel like no woman over 5' tall could wear this.,31019,2
31019,"Seller offered to send me a medium, but I don't want bigger....just longer so it covers my parts.",31019,2
31019,Pattern is super cute though.,31019,2
31020,Cheap material,31020,2
31021,Many faulty pin backs makes only 3/4 of these useable.,31021,2
31021,I made backpack buttons with these and I managed to lose almost all of them due to the clasps coming undone.,31021,2
31021,I'd suggest investing in higher quality pin backs if you're looking for heavy wear and tear or long term pins.,31021,2
31022,Fit is great.,31022,2
31022,Style is cute.,31022,2
31022,Color ran and bled into other clothes even after 2 washes and a week in the ocean and pool.,31022,2
31023,"Initial Review: Very attractive and like the other Eazybelts I have, I expect this one to look brand new after years of wear.",31023,2
31023,Edited Review: I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 2.,31023,2
31023,"I love EazyBelts, but the buckle has broken on two of the several I have after 1- to 2 years.",31023,2
31023,"Until the buckle breaks, the belts look brand-new.",31023,2
31023,"Once broken, the belts are useless, so I am giving up on the EazyBelt product line.",31023,2
31023,I will try some other ratchet belt in the future.,31023,2
31024,"Very short, too small, sleeves and cuffs even tight on daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than myself.",31024,2
31025,Poor quality!,31025,2
31025,The whole for the button wasn't even cut i had to cut it open.,31025,2
31025,Too thin they feel like leggings,31025,2
31026,"I think the cost was great, but the structure of the sweater was awkward.",31026,2
31026,"I got a size large so the sweater would be comfy, but the sleeves are too short and the shoulders are too wide.",31026,2
31026,I still will wear the sweater but I probably would not purchase again.,31026,2
31027,"The cut of the shirt is not the same at all as it is in the photo it doesn't cover your belly button like in the photo and the neck line is much higher up, it's like a baby version of the one in the picture, only plus is the design is clear and material is comfortable",31027,2
31028,"cheap material, see-thru",31028,2
31029,"Just okay, not as flattering as I thought it would be.",31029,2
31030,Looks so much better in pictures provided.,31030,2
31030,The quality is not what I expected.,31030,2
31030,Material is very itchy and it is very pouffy.,31030,2
31030,Looks more like for a child than for an adult.,31030,2
31031,They are nice and fit okay but the zipper is very weak and most of them have ripped the first time I put them on.,31031,2
31031,It's also very hard to zip it up while I'm putting it on.,31031,2
31032,Cute cut but the color is really ugly (in my opinion).,31032,2
31032,I mean I'm not a huge fan of periwinkle anyway but the cut was so cute I thought I could overlook that minor flaw...yeah so not so much...this looked so much worse in person.,31032,2
31032,The offwhite/beige looking lace at the top is actually bright white and the shirt is more of a really bad light blue.,31032,2
31032,I feel like it looks costumey- still the cut IS kinda cute if it were just different colors (I even debated trying to dye it) but decided I'm too lazy and I just can't get over the colors.,31032,2
31032,Maybe for someone with cool skin tones and who likes to rock baby pastels(?),31032,2
31032,giving two stars for being halfway cute.,31032,2
31032,"As for sizing, this runs a little small.",31032,2
31032,"I'm 5'5"" about 145, 34DD and typically wear med shirts.",31032,2
31032,However I ordered a medium and I should have gotten a large or maybe even XL for it to fit like it does on the model.,31032,2
31033,"too floppy, covers her whole face when wet, can't wear anywhere near pool, baby pool, etc.",31033,2
31033,"Cute, but who needs cute when you are trying to protect your little one from the sun.",31033,2
31033,Needs a sturdier brim!,31033,2
31033,If it had that I would then give it five stars!,31033,2
31033,!,31033,2
31034,These start out amazing.,31034,2
31034,"After a couple weeks of constant usage, the clasp don't hold onto the material and keep slipping.",31034,2
31034,For the price you would expect a much longer use.,31034,2
31035,Zipper broke after less than 2 weeks of use.,31035,2
31036,Itchy fabric and too small,31036,2
31037,"This is a cute shirt, but what I received doesn't look much like the picture.",31037,2
31037,"I thought the lace was more delicate, but it was really just die cute type fabric.",31037,2
31037,"Also the bottom of the picture shows lace, my shirt didn't have this.",31037,2
31037,"Also the fit was off, and i feel like it wasn't cut properly, I tugged at it alot.",31037,2
31038,Very inaccurate sizing.,31038,2
31038,Returned.,31038,2
31038,Color was nice.,31038,2
31038,"Material seems nice as well but the sleeves are very ""wingy""",31038,2
31039,I was so excited to try on this dress and so completely disappointed when I received it.,31039,2
31039,For the price you would think the material would be better - it wears like a cheap wal-mart maxi I might buy for the beach and the material is too thin and see through.,31039,2
31039,It looks cute and slouchy in the picture but in reality looks like a standard scoop neck black tshirt sewn on to a skirt.,31039,2
31039,"The print on the skirt is still pretty, though.",31039,2
31039,I'm just really disappointed in this dress.,31039,2
31039,Returning it.,31039,2
31040,I returned this.,31040,2
31040,The material was ok but the style of the shirt wasn't very shapely and the sleeves were too tight and too high,31040,2
31041,"The dress is cute, but it doesn't look anything like Boden.",31041,2
31041,Maybe from far away squinting (or the small picture on the internet) but up close you can tell it's a total knock off.,31041,2
31041,The stripes are printed on vs. woven into the fabric and the cotton is cheaper quality (shorter threads).,31041,2
31041,The dogs have lots of stitching with very shiny thread where Boden has more natural frayed edges.,31041,2
31041,"Also, the sizes are a little small.",31041,2
31041,You can tell it's made for the Asian market so if your child is petite then this might be great for you.,31041,2
31041,"Slim arm holes, shorter length and slender a-line.",31041,2
31041,"Boden has great sales, so if you time their sales then you can buy their product for a very comparable price.",31041,2
31041,I always buy end of season for next year.,31041,2
31042,2 stars for the awesome design and shirt material quality.,31042,2
31042,Unfortunatly the 2xl runs fairly small and the shirt length is short.,31042,2
31042,"(28inches )
 I placed the croc shirt over a Flash Gordon 2xl shirt.",31042,2
31042,"(which fits perfectly)
I wouldn't recommend this shirt for anyone with an average to longer torso , or larger chest/arms(muscular guys especially ).",31042,2
31043,Cute dress.,31043,2
31043,Not a true size 8.,31043,2
31044,The cap is a very attractive cap and just what I was looking for.,31044,2
31044,"However, anyone whose head is larger than medium will not be able to wear this cap.",31044,2
31044,"Since it is adjustable, I don't understand why the manufacturer didn't allow for additional expansion in head size.",31044,2
31045,feel a part,31045,2
31046,"it came broken, and I had to fix it.",31046,2
31047,very cute bag but smaller than I expected.,31047,2
31048,The clock is non-functioning...it's just pieces you put together to use to teach time.,31048,2
31048,I'm not sure why I didn't figure that out from the description.,31048,2
31048,"Even more disappointing, the watch clasp would not stay closed.",31048,2
31048,This had to be returned for a refund.,31048,2
31049,"This looks cute in the picture, but it's just weird!",31049,2
31049,"I was expecting a sweater, but this is a very thin and not woven material.",31049,2
31049,The patches are a weird tan plastic; hopefully I can just remove them.,31049,2
31049,And they aren't really in the right spot anyway.,31049,2
31050,Doesn't really look like a volleyball.,31050,2
31050,I had to explain it to the recipient.,31050,2
31051,It fit BUT looks like a nightgown .,31051,2
31051,I returned it,31051,2
31052,Fits a ( year old.,31052,2
31052,I love how this looks.,31052,2
31052,and when i got the shirt it does look exactly like the picture...only half the size.,31052,2
31052,i had to end up giving this to my 9 year old niece because it was not long enough.,31052,2
31052,the picture clearly shows that the shirt goes past her hips.,31052,2
31052,this would have been a mid-drift on me.,31052,2
31052,i thought for a minute i ordered a childrens size but no i did not.,31052,2
31052,"i am a curvy woman and know my XL or XXL size is hard to find so when i order it, i truly expect to find something better than this.",31052,2
31053,Floppy is one thing but it hangs in face like a Sheepdog's fur.,31053,2
31053,Cannot see a thing when it is on.,31053,2
31053,"Brim is not sturdy enough to roll back or fold up, flops back down.",31053,2
31053,"Great for keeping sun out if face and eyes, as long as you don't mind not being able to see anything.",31053,2
31054,the large we got was more like a sm/md,31054,2
31055,Beautiful.,31055,2
31055,But coming from a 5 ft 1 in girl.,31055,2
31055,It went barely past my butt.,31055,2
31055,It was more like a weird oversized shirt.,31055,2
31056,Lost a stone within 4 months.,31056,2
31057,I really wanted this to work but it didn't.,31057,2
31057,I'm a 34C and I bought a size large.,31057,2
31057,I mainly bought this for the top and the sizing is weird.,31057,2
31057,The cup area is a tiny bit small for enough coverage over my breasts but then the band was too loose.,31057,2
31057,If it was a large cup but with a medium size band this could've fit me better.,31057,2
31057,"The top basically rests on my body, if I make the slightest jump it'll definitely fall off.",31057,2
31057,I've attached an image of it resting and how much larger the band is for my,31057,2
31058,I thought that this product is good enough for my big head...,31058,2
31058,Wish they have a bigger one,31058,2
31059,"T-shirt is 50% cotton, 50% polyester--NOT 100% cotton as described.",31059,2
31060,Bad smell when arrived.,31060,2
31060,I put them on a shelf.,31060,2
31060,Deciding if I should donate to the Goodwill.....,31060,2
31061,Charm is nice but chain must be for a newborn.,31061,2
31061,Ridiculously short!,31061,2
31061,Pissed off about it,31061,2
31062,The tank tops were shorter in length and much wider than they appear on the picture.,31062,2
31062,Also the cut of the tank top is higher in the front than is showed on the picture.,31062,2
31063,The size fit M not XXL,31063,2
31064,Definitely not one size fits all.,31064,2
31064,I had to lose the size seems and re-stitch them out a little further.,31064,2
31065,Too big and material quality is poor.,31065,2
31066,The main medallion broke as soon as I tried to wear it.,31066,2
31066,"I understand that you can not expect a lot from a 99 cent item, but for it to break out of the bag is just ridiculous.",31066,2
31066,Buyer beware!,31066,2
31067,I followed the directions on the size chart and was still very disappointed to find that the bathing suit didn't fit.,31067,2
31067,At all.,31067,2
31067,The bathing suit was too small and the tanking was too large.,31067,2
31067,It wasn't a good fit.,31067,2
31067,I will be returning.,31067,2
31067,Btw I'm your average 5'4 130lb regular runner and I ordered a medium.,31067,2
31067,The large may have fit but the tankini would have been a sheet- if the medium was too large.,31067,2
31067,"Also, the bathing suit is more of a micro bikini.",31067,2
31067,The tankini is a fitted shirt in bathing suit material.,31067,2
31068,"Purchased this top in twodifferent colors , but the same size.",31068,2
31068,"They were completely different in size, and quality however .",31068,2
31068,The silver one is wearing very badly and seems to be stretched out of shape .,31068,2
31068,The black one is wearing beautifully .,31068,2
31068,"If I was sure I could get something of the quality of the black one again I would make a repeat purchase , but it appears that consistency is a problem in this product .",31068,2
31069,Loved the design online but once I received it was way too small even though I followed the sizing guide and my husband is very thin!,31069,2
31069,No stretch whatsoever and fabric is horrible.,31069,2
31070,Ran small but I could losen up the back to make it fit,31070,2
31071,"Some of the beads were quite loose on two of the rings, but the other two were okay.",31071,2
31071,Nothing special about them.,31071,2
31071,The are not as pretty as they are in the photo.,31071,2
31071,Safe to say they were only in my nipples for a couple of weeks until I found prettier ones.,31071,2
31072,It's really thight and the logo is not even one word is not even with the other one even twist I won't even up..,31072,2
31073,I expected these to be knitted from the description.,31073,2
31073,They are very shear gauze material,31073,2
31074,The skirt is unbelievable small.,31074,2
31074,Could not fit in the most skinny person I know.,31074,2
31074,It seems like a child size.,31074,2
31075,The scarf fell apart after being worn for less than one winter.,31075,2
31075,So far the hat is fine.,31075,2
31076,kept coming off the front and back of my boots.,31076,2
31077,The attached shirt and jacket was on the cheap looking side.,31077,2
31078,"I love the elastic neckline for breastfeeding, but the seam below breasts is obnoxiously narrow; the seam cuts across at my nipples (which obviously are tender after nursing!).",31078,2
31078,This is clearly meant for smaller chested women.,31078,2
31078,I have another gown with no seam that is so much more comfortable and fits any chest size.,31078,2
31079,dress is pretty but i didn't pay to have a messed up dress:( the straps weren't even attached to the back of the dress and the zipper came off.,31079,2
31079,will have to fix it myself.,31079,2
31079,:/,31079,2
31080,Terrible.,31080,2
31080,Nothing like the pic,31080,2
31081,"This shirt was so cute and I really wanted it to work, but the mesh inset across the chest was torn upon arrival.",31081,2
31081,I can see how that could happen after just a few washes too.,31081,2
31081,"Sadly, I had to return it.",31081,2
31082,The back doesn't fit the heel right and it falls off,31082,2
31083,The sweater is not yellow as depicted.,31083,2
31083,It is a dark mustard yellow or even greenish yellow color.,31083,2
31083,Its also really short in the arms.,31083,2
31083,Although the bodice is as expected.,31083,2
31083,"The length of the sweater is really short, and I am quite small, 5.3, size 2.",31083,2
31083,So I  know what I say.,31083,2
31083,The quality is wool.,31083,2
31083,but a bit on the scratchy side.,31083,2
31083,"Its thick, but I wouldn't call it soft.",31083,2
31083,You might like it if you weren't looking for a bright yellow sweater as I was.,31083,2
31084,just much to big,31084,2
31085,I returned them.,31085,2
31085,Them didn't have enough cushioning and hurt my feet.,31085,2
31085,"But I have problem feet, so they may be fine for others.",31085,2
31086,"When I received this necklace the link holding the two collar pieces together was broken, so I improvised with some other chain I had from a different necklace.",31086,2
31086,The length of the chain is too long for my taste and not easily adjustable (I'll need to literally take the chain apart to reduce the chain length on both sides with how the clasp is situated in order to make it the correct length).,31086,2
31086,I think the concept is cute and design beautiful but overall execution is lacking.,31086,2
31086,Ultimately I'll probably end up replacing the chain altogether.,31086,2
31087,Way too small for a medium.,31087,2
31087,Go one or two sizes up.,31087,2
31088,Look very cheap.,31088,2
31088,Will probably wear them for Halloween,31088,2
31089,I returned the item.,31089,2
31090,very baggy and hangs low.,31090,2
31090,Would like to return but too lazy.,31090,2
31090,My boyfriend doesn't like it at all.,31090,2
31090,The fabric is OK.,31090,2
31090,I might redesign it.,31090,2
31091,Too small.,31091,2
31091,Might fit a middle schoolers face.,31091,2
31092,"It's a beautiful hoodie, but unfortunately because it is way too small for an adult I am very disappointed in this.",31092,2
31092,It sits in my bedroom unused and the cost of sending it back is not worth it.,31092,2
31092,I will not purchase from this company again.,31092,2
31093,Not what I had expected.,31093,2
31093,The color wasn't bright but dull.,31093,2
31093,Not Like the authentic USC sweatshirts.,31093,2
31094,"Run extremely small, disappointed",31094,2
31095,"First of all, this is a men's shirt so it looks stupid on women...you know...the sleeveless biker kind of tank.",31095,2
31095,Yuck.,31095,2
31095,"Second, the lettering is WAY OFF - it is as though the CAMP and the AGNE and the CAMP and the AIGN  are all separate words.",31095,2
31096,"A bit bulky, hangs on top lip...",31096,2
31096,Very big.,31096,2
31096,"I""ve purchased many septum clickers, but this one is far bigger than the others.",31096,2
31096,Too bad too since it is cute,31096,2
31097,They are cute but super long.,31097,2
31097,"I cut off the bottom part and they were the correct length, but they developed holes the first time they went through the wash.",31097,2
31097,Waste of money,31097,2
31098,"Beautiful, but way too small.",31098,2
31099,Woah--TOO small!!,31099,2
31099,Back they go.,31099,2
31100,I'm 34B and all this does is stick to my boobs- no lifting whatsoever.,31100,2
31100,Save your money.,31100,2
31101,Material feels wonderful.,31101,2
31101,For some reason all three shirts for differently.,31101,2
31101,Hopefully I can stretch the small ones out.,31101,2
31102,The belt I received was very unevenly stained.,31102,2
31102,I'll can only use it as a work belt.,31102,2
31103,Sadly I had to return this product because it was just too small.,31103,2
31103,"It was short, and when I got it zipped up it looked ridiculous on me.",31103,2
31103,"But I am a medium sized person, I have a feeling it is made for slender built people.",31103,2
31103,It was super soft though!,31103,2
31103,It just wasn't for me.,31103,2
31104,"This top was listed under ""womens"" plus size.",31104,2
31104,"When I got it, the tag clear says ""kids"".",31104,2
31104,I liked the blouse and would have loved to wear it back when I was 10 years old!,31104,2
31105,Price was great but it does NOT match white gold in color.,31105,2
31105,"If you wear this by itself, it's totally fine.",31105,2
31105,"But I'd you wear it next to a white gold engagement ring, it will look gray in comparison.",31105,2
31106,Way too small,31106,2
31107,The zipper was broken when I got it,31107,2
31108,"Top was a little big, bottoms a little small.",31108,2
31108,Top doesn't give much support either.,31108,2
31109,I can only speak about the Style-2 Black bikini.,31109,2
31109,I bought one size up based on other recommendations.,31109,2
31109,"The suit ended up being way too large, possibly even two sizes too big.",31109,2
31110,"Beware, the color is fluorescent!!",31110,2
31110,They are blinding!!,31110,2
31110,"I even tried to bleach them out, but the color didn't ever fade the slightest bit.",31110,2
31110,Wish I had spent a couple more dollars and got a more subtle color.,31110,2
31110,"Other than that, they are well made and fit well.",31110,2
31110,I guess they would work well for hunters who want to be seen from a distance.,31110,2
31110,:-),31110,2
31111,was clearly a child's size gave it to my granddaughter,31111,2
31112,"It isn't a dress, it is a large shirt.. and the material is a little transparent.",31112,2
31113,It's good quality material BUT!,31113,2
31113,The elastic band on the pants is really thick and stiff and i feel like it would be too tight around a baby's tummy.,31113,2
31113,I sew so I plan to replace the elastic for sure.,31113,2
31113,Not comfortable for a baby a baby at all.,31113,2
31113,And this is a 6 month + size for sure.,31113,2
31113,I wouldn't be shocked if it fit more of a 12 month old.,31113,2
31114,Pretty cheap.,31114,2
31114,Will not order from this brand again,31114,2
31115,I usually get medium so I ordered large and it's too big and does not fit well.,31115,2
31115,I ordered large because of all the reviews,31115,2
31116,I should return or give it away:(,31116,2
31117,"Fits ok but wired cheap material, gotta return.",31117,2
31117,I am a 14/16,31117,2
31118,Zipper did not work.,31118,2
31119,Much lower quality than other choker bracelets that I have bought.,31119,2
31119,Within a week and a half of wear both bracelets (I got two for this price) became undone at the closing.,31119,2
31120,Didn't fit as well as I hoped for.,31120,2
31120,Our 5 month old wiggles a lot and easily escaped this.,31120,2
31120,The material is nice for eczema kids though!,31120,2
31121,"Item arrived on time, but with the left side bent to the point where it's uncomfortable to wear (see pictures).",31121,2
31121,"Doubt it's a shipping thing, because the package it came in was very well padded out, and the other item in the package was fine.",31121,2
31121,"Originally the left arm was bent at an even sharper angle, and I straightened it thinking I'd just deal with it because it's still a pretty damn cheap price to pay for a decent looking pair of sunglasses, but then I put it on and realised that the lens itself is bent.",31121,2
31121,"When worn, it presses against my left cheekbone, and is really uncomfortable.",31121,2
31122,Cute but the back of the dress is not as far down as it is in the picture.,31122,2
31122,It is all the way at the top so now when I wear my bra with it you will see it.,31122,2
31122,:( I ordered it because in the picture it came all the way down smh,31122,2
31123,I returned this dress.,31123,2
31123,There were several issues with it.,31123,2
31123,"First, I am 5'3"" and 125 lbs.",31123,2
31123,"I bought a size 6, according to the chart.",31123,2
31123,"The dress is very fitted, and was too tight through the hips and thighs.",31123,2
31123,"I am small, but curvy, so maybe someone slimmer would do ok.",31123,2
31123,"I don't think a size up would have helped, because the proportions were also off for me.",31123,2
31123,"The black band that appears to fit under the bust was more down on my waist, which made the top fit awkwardly.",31123,2
31123,"Again, maybe someone taller would be ok, but then the dress might be too short.",31123,2
31123,It was not long on me.,31123,2
31123,"In fact, with a small heel, it would have been just right in the length.",31123,2
31123,"But other than the fit, I just didn't like the look of the dress.",31123,2
31123,"It looks good in the picture, but in person, the lace is very shiny and looks cheap.",31123,2
31123,"The lining is a nude color, which doesn't show in the pic, but does show under the white part.",31123,2
31123,"The top of the dress is padded, almost too padded, but is not supportive.",31123,2
31123,This also made the top look weird.,31123,2
31123,"I think you could get away with a strapless bra, but I didn't try it.",31123,2
31123,"Also, not sure if the pictures show it or not, but the black lace extends out in the back to form a train.",31123,2
31124,I have to give these glasses two stars for the fact that they are advertised for children 3-12yo.,31124,2
31124,These are clearly for children 3-7yo unless your 8+ child has an exceptionally small head.,31124,2
31124,"**Seller, please adjust your product description accordingly -- Amazon has a great return policy but you have now created an errand for me that I really didn't need.",31124,2
31125,But I can still wear it - understand now clothes coming from China is made to fit they people so we on the western has to ask for XXL,31125,2

31133,The stitching and zipper were very nice.,31133,2
31133,"However, when I put it on, the waistband area was much lower than my waist.",31133,2
31133,"It sat closer to my hips which caused an unattractive muffin-top issue, which I normally don't have.",31133,2
31133,"I am long waisted to begin with, that's why I was shocked the waist was too long for me.",31133,2
31133,"Had the waistband been an inch or so higher, this dress would have been amazing and I would have ordered it in every single color.",31133,2
31134,"The quality of fabric and workmanship was quite nice, and the price is great, but I guess ""One Size"" does not include ladies size 12.",31134,2
31134,I did not even bother to try it on.,31134,2
31134,"Perhaps it means something totally different, in China.",31134,2

31181,Bathing suit was extremely small!,31181,2
31181,Says it's a large but I don't believe it's any bigger than what a EXTRA SMALL would be!,31181,2

31182,"I did wear this to the office Christmas party, but didn't feel fabulous.",31182,2
31182,"It was very low cut, and I spent all day looking for a leopard print cami to go underneath.",31182,2
31182,"The color, which I was hoping was a dusty rose was more of a, well, dirt brown.",31182,2
31182,"(hence the leopard print...to match my shoes) I thought the wrap style, empire waist would hide certain figure flaws...but I really felt thick in this dress.",31182,2
31182,The arms were also shorter than I like - but probably pretty true to the photo.,31182,2
31182,The fabric is very casual cotton.,31182,2
31182,"I will keep it because I wore it, and I will see if it works better for summer...",31182,2

31184,Thin and large.,31184,2
31185,Oh I soooooo loved this dress.,31185,2
31185,"But, I can't get over the front side pocket and how it just fell into my armpits.",31185,2

31192,I couldn't carry it off.,31192,2
31192,It didn't flatter.,31192,2
31193,I bought it because I loved the simplicity.,31193,2
31193,But the chains are a tangled mess more often than not.,31193,2
31193,"If you make jewelry, you'll need to do some modifying!",31193,2

31196,Poorly made!,31196,2
31196,The straps are different lengths and is too tight in the bust.,31196,2
31197,"After reading the reviews that this product runs small, I ordered a larger size.",31197,2
31197,"It was WAY too big, and since the price was VERY reasonable, the local charity received the donation of the dress instead of dealing with the hassle of a return.",31197,2
31198,Lumpy and ugly.,31198,2
31198,Returning,31198,2
31199,"Cheap fake leather, there are better quality fake leather out there.",31199,2
31199,I used them for the hardware.,31199,2
31200,"The top band is too tight and even though they are supposed to be mostly cotton, they feel like they are synthetic.",31200,2
31200,I have old Wigwam crew socks that I love and I wish they still made them like they used to.,31200,2
31201,"Looks cool but does not live up to it's endorsed ""durability"" and I just got the wallet today and it is already spewing out my cards along with the button that's a challenge to open.",31201,2
31202,Not my best purchase at all.,31202,2
31202,Bought it a couple of months ago and haven't worn it yet.,31202,2
31202,"Color is dull, fits weird, not flattering at all.",31202,2
31202,Gave it a 2 since the fabric quality is ok.,31202,2
31203,Handles are cheaply made I didn't return them on time now I'm stuck with them,31203,2
31204,Looked better on the picture,31204,2
31205,Shirt is so small and horrible quality,31205,2
31206,I had a size large from belly bandit.com and this size medium was wayyyy smaller than expected.,31206,2
31206,Its smaller than the one from the webite,31206,2
31207,"i knew the minute i put it on that it was categorically not 100% cashmere, since it itched.",31207,2
31207,i went looking for labels.,31207,2
31207,"there are no sewn in labels, which is always worrisome.",31207,2
31207,it had 2 tags dangling off it.,31207,2
31207,"both were predominantly chinese characters, paired unhelpfully with a smattering of english.",31207,2
31207,"example on one tag's side ""company profile"" followed by characters only.",31207,2
31207,"nonetheless, i believe i found persuasive evidence that it was known to not be 100% cashmere simply by making assumption that one place it had the grouping of percents associated with characters-only of 70%/20%/10% would be materials.",31207,2
31207,"incidentally, my checking ""too small"" on fit question, is not a complaint since i know that ""asian"" labeled clothes mean i, a medium, will need to order at least XXL usually.",31207,2
31207,it's definitely shorter than in the picture.,31207,2
31207,the dress is beautiful & not see-through.,31207,2
31207,i will either return it or check if any of my nieces don't have wool-itch response & pass it along.,31207,2
31207,"i have a beside-the-point thing to say which i will not elaborate on - the packaging is unusual, functional & beautiful.",31207,2
31208,The dress does look like the picture...it arrived much quicker than expected and does appear to be sewn well.,31208,2
31208,"However there is no shape to the bodice, its basically a straight up and down tube.",31208,2
31208,The chest is nearly flat and was clearly not designed for anyone with breasts (despite the measurements being provided).,31208,2
31208,The floral pattern with sequens is very pretty but its completely see through down to the bottom of the breast area.,31208,2
31208,"You can completely see the underlaying built is bra and it is not made of attractive fabric, its ugly tan with visible seams showing through.",31208,2
31208,"Because the chest is flat the area above your breasts does not follow the curves of your body, it gaps at the arm holes and pulls awkwardly, the waist bunches and it pulls at the hips.",31208,2
31208,Also the dress is extremely long (despite the fact that I specified I would be wearing flats) its about 5 inches too long in the front.,31208,2
31208,I ordered a size up in case I needed to get it altered.,31208,2
31208,"There will be no altering this dress, I would have to take it completely apart.",31208,2
31208,I might recommend it for extremely tall people with A cup breasts.....,31208,2
31208,"If you have any curves, its not for you.",31208,2
31208,So disappointed.,31208,2
31208,I searched for weeks to find an affordable dress that was perfect for a casual outdoor wedding.,31208,2
31208,Waited for it to be delivered and now have no wedding dress.,31208,2
31208,I guess I'll be learning about the return policy now.,31208,2
31209,colors are not as expected!,31209,2
31210,"The positives: Opening these in the package, I was thrilled by how soft they were.",31210,2
31210,"Super, pleasantly soft and comfy to put on.",31210,2
31210,I was also pleasantly surprised with how much stretch they had.,31210,2
31210,"Lastly, the pattern is really lovely and fun.",31210,2
31210,Negatives: they definitely run a little on the short side.,31210,2
31210,"It works for me, but I am 5'4.",31210,2
31210,"Anyone much taller or longer in the legs than me, and they will start looking more like capris.",31210,2
31210,Also... after one wear.,31210,2
31210,"ONE, they started to get holes in the rear.",31210,2
31210,Not even washed yet.,31210,2
31210,I am super sad because I really loved these pretties out of the package and would have worn them a lot!,31210,2
31211,This doesn't look close to what is pictured and does not lay right.,31211,2
31211,Very disappointed.,31211,2
31212,Felt damp in packaging and had an odd smell.,31212,2
31212,Sizing is nothing as pictured.,31212,2
31212,"I was surprised to find a rather pink section in the sleeves, whereas in the photo it appears to be a very pale pink, so that you may not see that pink is in the sleeves.",31212,2
31212,An odd color combination once I tried it on.,31212,2
31212,The sleeves are not long as pictured and shirt came with a snag under the arm.,31212,2
31212,Had it came looking as pictured I would have loved it.,31212,2
31212,Not at all impressed.,31212,2
31213,"First of all, this dress is not linen.",31213,2
31213,It is stiff lightweight cotton.,31213,2
31213,"Additionally, the quality is low with many lose threads.",31213,2
31213,"The price was low, so I guess I am not going to complain to much since my expectations were low because of the price.",31213,2
31213,"However, reviews stating the dress of of high quality are misrepresentations or not accustom to quality made garments.",31213,2
31213,I will say that theoretically the design of the dress is cute.,31213,2
31214,Really cheap material.,31214,2
31214,The stitching wasn't even aligned.,31214,2
31214,Not worth $8.,31214,2
31215,Too small,31215,2
31216,"Had to return, the band at the bottom is too large and the top is to small",31216,2
31217,"Cute jeans (although there wasn't a hole for the button to go into a top of the zipper, we had to cut one ourselves).",31217,2
31217,Ordered a black pair LOVED them (they were a little loose though).,31217,2
31217,"Decided to order them in white in ONE SIZE smaller, couldn't even pull them up past my thighs.",31217,2
31217,Disappointed in the drastic size difference.,31217,2
31218,I wear a large and the yellow top was more like a medium and I ordered an x large.,31218,2
31218,Too small for me,31218,2
31219,"Very much smaller than a 4X, closer to a 2X.",31219,2
31219,The adult medium we also ordered was true to size.,31219,2
31220,"They look cool, but they are unusually small and hard to get over my heel.",31220,2
31220,I wear 11.5.,31220,2
31221,Gave it away.,31221,2
31222,The hoodie looked nothing like the hoodie displayed online.,31222,2
31222,The hoodie I received was faded.,31222,2
31223,It's ok for the price,31223,2
31224,"Collects dust

my daughter is 11 months and the slippers fit big, but I expected that based on the other reviews.",31224,2
31224,I think after she is a year old they will fit.,31224,2
31225,"Its nice when you first get it, but after about 4 days, the lock on the back had broken and a few days following the chain had broke, but the chain was fix able, and the lock still makes it useable.",31225,2
31225,"Its also kinda awkward, for me due to the fact it had folded up awkwardly and didn't fall right on my collar bone/ neck.",31225,2
31226,It were big.,31226,2
31226,Fits me baggy.,31226,2
31227,"These were extremely uncomfortable to wear as the ""round"" ends almost all had very rough edges that do not feel good in, on, or around your nose.",31227,2
31227,"Also, as some reviewers have stated, these were smaller than 18G.",31227,2
31228,Kinda cheap feeling material.,31228,2
31228,Small fitting,31228,2
31229,Poor fit ...at least for my head,31229,2
31230,"it fit me well.. the problem was that Im almost about a DD and I'm 5'4 so my weight, and chest kind of play into this shirt.",31230,2
31230,"I'm not fat, I'm just chubby and have soft corners.",31230,2
31230,i had a medium (most of my shirts are medium) and it only went to my boobs then cut off.. so yes i would recommend  getting 2 sizes up ladies,31230,2
31231,I have wanted to order this dress for a long time.,31231,2
31231,"It looks beautiful, flattering, and long in the picture.",31231,2
31231,"I usually wear a medium or large, depending on the brand and style.",31231,2
31231,So I ordered a medium in this dress.,31231,2
31231,"It was wayyy too tight, and
It fit like a small.",31231,2
31231,"I'm 5'9, 150lbs so I would have considered exchanging for a larger size if it was only too tight.",31231,2
31231,However it's also a lot shorter than it appears on the model.,31231,2
31231,And I mean it didn't even reach my ankles..huge bummer.,31231,2
31231,"Beyond this, the color in person seems different than pictured, too.",31231,2
31231,"I wish it would have been more like it is pictured, as it appears to be a beautiful dress.",31231,2
31231,"Overall, I was pretty disappointed..I had expected a different kind of product for the price.",31231,2
31232,I am five feet tall and 100 pounds.,31232,2
31232,The style of it was very cute but the material just seemed extremely cheap.,31232,2
31232,It's completely see through.,31232,2
31232,Listen to all the other reviewers and order a size up.,31232,2
31232,It fit really weird on me.,31232,2
31232,"The waist band was extremely tight and too small around my waist, but the bust area with very large (my boobs literally hang out) that i'd have to pin it closed or even sew it closed.. that would be way too much of a hassle especially when I need to use the bathroom lol.",31232,2
31232,Sorry but I am returning this.,31232,2
31232,You get what you pay for.,31232,2
31233,Too small.,31233,2
31234,"The ""White Jade"" appears nothing like the picture at all.",31234,2
31234,"There is no pink tone to my set whatsoever, it seems like they just gave me a pair of white plugs instead.",31234,2
31234,"I really like the purple and black ones, but I was most excited for the pink set.",31234,2
31234,I'm very disappointed I was not given what I paid for.,31234,2
31235,I liked it better online.,31235,2
31236,"Normally I don't do reviews, but when a product comes to me unfinished and not in the size I ordered, I'm sorry but the company needs to know.",31236,2
31236,But anyway I ordered a size 30 and got a random size of 31.,31236,2
31236,Not only that but I also got a pair that wasn't finished.,31236,2
31236,The button hole where you close the jeans need to be split open with a knife and the patches where the metal studs are don't even look like the excess was cut off...this wasn't what I was expecting.,31236,2
31236,The black pair I ordered from China was a lot better than this one.,31236,2
31236,But oh well...,31236,2
31237,I ordered an XL and ended up giving it to my 6 year old niece.,31237,2
31238,Too short & wide,31238,2
31239,They of course don't look like the picture... but they are cheap and work.,31239,2
31240,I bought these mittens for my 20 month old son so he could play in the snow.,31240,2
31240,I wasn't sure what the fit would be like because the reviews were all over the place so I took a chance.,31240,2
31240,I was able to get the mittens on my son's hand and the thumb part in but the mittens didn't go far enough on his hand up the wrist.,31240,2
31240,These were just a bit too small.,31240,2
31240,I would say it would probably be a good fit for up to 18 months perhaps.,31240,2
31240,I ended up returning this.,31240,2
31241,It's not as long as I would like and print kind of cheap looking.,31241,2
31241,The color and flower fringe are pretty tho.,31241,2
31241,"Size is about like a neckerchief, material,a cheap chiffon.",31241,2
31242,Really disappointed in this top.,31242,2
31242,"Firstly, it is nowhere near the neon pink colour in the photo (big no no for me), secondly although somewhat big on me I had to tug at the sleeve to make it actually an off the shoulder look.",31242,2
31242,The material is heavier than expected but very soft to the feel.,31242,2
31243,Ran too small and the top barely zips up.,31243,2
31244,I had purchased these for my elderly mother.,31244,2
31244,The outer ridge is to hard and totally inflexible.,31244,2
31244,I found them VERY difficult to put on and I know she wouldn't have the dexterity to handle them..,31244,2
31244,I thought they would have an elastic edge which would allow easier and softer handling.,31244,2
31244,I had to return them.,31244,2
31244,Sorry.,31244,2
31245,"fits like a M/L, too short, sleeves too tight",31245,2
31246,Cute dress but  was too long,31246,2
31247,I think they forgot to sew the shorts?!?,31247,2
31247,It opens on the sides!,31247,2
31247,Doesn't make sense?!?,31247,2
31247,They fit baggy and are not unflattering!,31247,2
31247,I like the top so I have it 2 stars !,31247,2
31248,This skirt is totally see through and not at all the type of material I was expecting.,31248,2
31248,I am disappointed with this purpose and doubt I'll ever wear it.,31248,2
31249,Came on time.,31249,2
31249,"Looks cheap, understandably no lighter fluid in it.",31249,2
31249,Haven't tried to put any in to see if it would even work because I would never wear it with how it looks.,31249,2
31249,I guess it does look like the picture.,31249,2
31249,"Overall, my dissatisfaction is my fault for forgetting to check the reviews.",31249,2
31250,"While very well made, the nylon material is very stiff, making the band hard to wrap around your wrist.",31250,2
31250,"More important, the holes cut in the nylon for the buckle tip to go into are VERY small.",31250,2
31250,The tip will not go in at all ... certainly not easily.,31250,2
31250,I had to use a BBQ meat fork to force the holes large enough for the buckle prong to go into them.,31250,2
31250,"Then, I realized the hole cut into the buckle itself was so small the buckle prong wouldn't move.",31250,2
31250,It does look great.,31250,2
31251,My strap broke the 2nd time I wore it.,31251,2
31251,The bottoms are unwearable because they are significantly smaller than the top,31251,2
31252,I expected a heavier fleece.,31252,2
31253,Not recommended for plus size girls loved the texture and design but it was to small.,31253,2
31253,Had to send it back,31253,2
31254,Fits small,31254,2
31255,Fit was too small,31255,2
31256,I thought it looked cheaply made for the cost.,31256,2
31256,It doesn't have the nice rounded look as shown in the picture.,31256,2
31256,"It looks flat and wide, not like others I have seen.",31256,2
31256,"Chain looks nice, but infinity looks flat and rugged like it was smashed with a hammer.",31256,2
31256,Not smooth like in the picture.,31256,2
31257,Shirt was very heavy and not soft.,31257,2
31257,It didn't seem like it would breathe well at all.,31257,2
31258,I sold them,31258,2
31259,tried 3 different ones.,31259,2
31259,non were like the picture.,31259,2
31259,kinda similar but not the same.,31259,2
31259,the quality was not as good as it looked in the picture.,31259,2
31259,also it was itchy and didn't fit well.,31259,2
31259,the seams weren't sew right.,31259,2
31260,Returned item.,31260,2
31260,Did not like feel of material.,31260,2
31261,Horrible quality don't buy if u are bigger than a size 6,31261,2
31262,I liked the material and design but actually it is too much larger than expected .. Maybe it is the Quicksilver standard model ..,31262,2
31262,I dunno,31262,2
31263,Hated the colors.,31263,2
31263,"Guess it was supposed to look like antique red, white and blue.",31263,2
31263,The problem was the white.,31263,2
31263,"Did not look like antiqued, rather it had green tint to it.",31263,2
31264,I ordered a size 3x I because I like loose fitting clothes I cannot get this blouse on to even wear it.,31264,2
31264,160 is all I weigh in think the size charts should be explained more.,31264,2
31264,Other then that the blouse is beautiful.,31264,2
31265,sizing was great!,31265,2
31265,But it came with several snags in the fabric and a hole!,31265,2
31265,!,31265,2
31266,I wish the skirt was a little longer.,31266,2
31267,"I'm sure this is a great product, however I ordered it according get to the measurements and it's to big even on the last row.",31267,2
31267,I tried to contact the seller to EXCHANGE it for a smaller size (not return it) and no one got back to me.,31267,2
31267,"For anyone who's measurements are closer to the next size up, don't go a size up because it will be too big and fit like a tank top",31267,2
31268,Within days the plastic sleeves began tearing one at a time.,31268,2
31268,Either the grade of material is too low or the quality of the seams is too weak.,31268,2
31268,"Whatever the cause, they shouldn't rip in such a short time.",31268,2
31268,I should have bought the more expensive one.,31268,2
31268,I suppose this is a case of you get what you pay for....,31268,2
31269,"I liked the style and feel, but it was too big all around and much too big in the armholes!",31269,2
31269,I bought a Jockey version of this nightgown in the same size and it was perfect.,31269,2
31270,This was probably the most disappointing product I've ever received from Amazon.,31270,2
31270,"I ordered an XL, and it fit like a small medium.",31270,2
31270,"I probably could get away with wearing mediums, but I like my shirts to fit loose so I normally get larges and XL's.",31270,2
31270,"I still wore this, but there weren't any tags to give any information about the material and what the proper washing instructions were.",31270,2
31270,So here's to hoping washing and drying it are okay.,31270,2
31270,I am upset with this product and do not recommend for purchase.,31270,2
31271,Only came in one size (med).,31271,2
31271,Had to return it.,31271,2
31272,Cheaper than it looks and not worth the price.,31272,2
31272,Nevertheless it is probably the best necklace this far for the shine 2.,31272,2
31272,I'm not shure the shine 2 supports being worn as a necklace yet and it may not be accurate in this fashion.,31272,2
31273,"Very snug in chest area, did not like material, returning this item",31273,2
31274,Didn't care for the bell sleeves and the sleeves were too long,31274,2
31275,These sweatpants are huge and bulky.,31275,2
31275,Order at least one size down.,31275,2
31276,The handles and exposed seams on the outside of the bag rub off and leave little pieces of brown material all over anything it touched.,31276,2
31276,The bag is really nice looking so it's disappointing that I likely won't ever carry it again.,31276,2
31277,It was really thin material,31277,2
31278,Didn't last very long.,31278,2
31279,It's cute.,31279,2
31279,But no recommended if your chest is bigger.,31279,2
31279,It barley covers my chest and right around bottom,31279,2
31280,This dress is very pretty in the image.,31280,2
31280,"I thought the top was going to be embroidered, it wasn't.",31280,2
31280,The top was also way to small for my bust (I'm fairly busty though so that happens frequently).,31280,2
31280,The fabric is not stretchy.,31280,2
31280,"I was disappointed by this dress, its so pretty in the image.",31280,2
31280,":( I might have kept it if it had fit my bust, I' not sure.",31280,2
31281,No what is advertised... cant wear in public.. covers basically NOTHING... could do as a teddy lingere...maybe,31281,2
31282,"These do not fit well, I had planned on wearing them with trendy winter outfits but these did not even come down to cover my ears.",31282,2
31282,I was very disappointed because they're otherwise very well made and super cute.,31282,2
31283,lesser quality than pictured,31283,2
31284,A little sheer ...,31284,2
31285,Very cheap looking plastic,31285,2
31286,Not so cute when received.,31286,2
31287,After reading the reviews I intentionally ordered a larger size but unfortunately it did not fit well.,31287,2
31287,The bottom portion was too big while the top portion was too small.,31287,2
31287,I had to return it.,31287,2
31288,it is very smal,31288,2
31289,kinda small,31289,2
31290,It isn't very attractive from the front.,31290,2
31290,The back is cute but it's a little to big.,31290,2
31290,I personally wouldn't buy this again.,31290,2
31291,Sorry had to rewrite this one because the handle to  to the purse just ripped.,31291,2
31291,I hadn't had it for more than a month.,31291,2
31291,I really like it to.,31291,2
31292,"These socks are OVER THE KNEE, longer than I wanted or enjoy.",31292,2
31293,Bad quality and I am not sure how you would adhere it to the ribbon.,31293,2
31293,I returned it,31293,2
31294,Cute but couldn't wear because the post are too thick and short.,31294,2
31294,Also the black paint is coming off.,31294,2
31294,Too bad.,31294,2
31295,The belly button fake pericing while it stays on.,31295,2
31295,It took me a minute or so to get the ring to stay.,31295,2
31295,"After it did it looked like a real piercing but after you move around or take a few steps or even like exhaled it would move and slide off, but it is a pretty jewelry.",31295,2
31296,Really small.,31296,2
31296,Can't wear it.,31296,2
31297,I ordered a large based on the reviews that this suit runs small.,31297,2
31297,The company sent an XL and it was way too small.,31297,2
31297,I wear a size 6.,31297,2
31297,Also the lace does not lay flat at all.,31297,2
31297,"It's nice for the price, but not for me.",31297,2
31298,Had to return waiting on refund they were to small loved the style but was to snug,31298,2
31299,To big,31299,2
31300,Shirt is cute.,31300,2
31300,"I usually wear a small, I'm 5'1 120 lbs, but ordered a medium.",31300,2
31300,The medium was too short!,31300,2
31300,"Instead of returning, I'll probably sell to a friend",31300,2
31301,"Pretty disappointed, I received these today, they may be good for a kid costume but not an adult pirate costume.",31301,2
31301,The picture lets you assume that they are silver like the clasp.,31301,2
31301,the clasp is a silver in color but the skull is a stamp picture on plastic..,31301,2
31301,I won't be wearing them..  A better description would had helped..,31301,2
31302,"Although the corset looks lovely, I am beyond upset that it is not a steel boned corset.",31302,2
31302,"This has cheap plastic boning, and the corset is so light weight it's ridiculous.",31302,2
31302,"I don't mind paying $20 for a plastic boned corset, if that's what I was expecting to buy, but this was advertised as steel and it is not!",31302,2
31303,Very disappointed as the material was very thin and size wrong.,31303,2
31303,I am a size 8 - 10 or medium and ordered an xl based on reviews.,31303,2
31303,It was still too small.,31303,2
31303,I will certainly not order clothes online from an unknown company again.,31303,2
31304,It was small,31304,2
31305,I had bought these shoes for my son to wear at daycare.,31305,2
31305,He would have them on for most of the day 4 days a week.,31305,2
31305,"The size is fine, however, within two days of wearing them they had rubbed a sore into the side of my sons foot.",31305,2
31305,Looking closer at the shoe there is a harder bit of plastic by the arch of the foot that caused the sore.,31305,2
31306,Pretty thin material.,31306,2
31306,Just ok,31306,2
31307,it was good but thought it would be bigger,31307,2
31308,Not what I expected and did not fall off the shoulder as in the pic.,31308,2
31308,Disappointed,31308,2
31309,Nice dress and well made.,31309,2
31309,"But, Way too big/wide for my 8 year old.",31309,2
31309,Getting a size smaller,31309,2
31310,"I've bought a Shark watch before, and loved it.",31310,2
31310,"Yet, this one has a lower quality feel to it, and the back light is not as effective to read.",31310,2
31311,Also my button connecting this was not attached and so I need to actually sew one on now.,31311,2
31312,"Pretty, but much smaller than expected.",31312,2
31312,I've included a photo below for reference.,31312,2
31312,I included a roll of quarters for scale.,31312,2
31313,Too large; returned.,31313,2
31314,This hat is way to floppy!,31314,2
31314,"Unfortunately, I waited too long to return it.",31314,2
31315,too large,31315,2
31316,its an odd fit.,31316,2
31316,small I like the print not the fit,31316,2
31317,"looks very cheap, but good for kids, the color is good though",31317,2
31318,"CONS:
-This looked nothing like the picture.",31318,2
31318,It was really white and they colors were very bright.,31318,2
31318,- Way way way way too small.,31318,2
31318,"I usually wear a size 5-7 jeans, med or large shirt (I like them baggy), and I am 5 feet 8.5 inches.",31318,2
31318,"I ordered a large, which according to the sizing chart it should have been big on me.",31318,2
31318,It was huge and baggy around my body but it was riding up A LOT.,31318,2
31318,It fit my friend height wise(she is 5 feet 5 inches) but it was baggy as can be on her.,31318,2
31318,This romper is completely disproportionate.,31318,2
31318,"PROS:
- The fabric was really soft and comfortable.",31318,2
31318,It would have made a great romper for the summer.,31318,2
31318,- It was well made.,31318,2
31318,Stitching was not falling out or anything.,31318,2
31318,- Love the pockets.,31318,2
31318,"OVERALL:
- I wouldn't recommend this product because the sizing is way off and the make of it is completely disproportionate.",31318,2
31318,- I gave it 2 stars because it seemed like nice quality but I am really upset with the sizing.,31318,2
31319,I bought this to help transition from regular clothes to maternity clothes.,31319,2
31319,"While the material is as expected, I thought the fit was a little off.",31319,2
31319,I looked at the size chart prior to purchasing and ordered the correct size.,31319,2
31319,"When I started using it, I had only gained a pound or two and it was very tight.",31319,2
31319,"I understand that it needs to be tight enough to keep pants from falling down, but it was hard for me to wear.",31319,2
31319,It became so tight throughout the day that it would leave major indents in my skin.,31319,2
31319,It also worked better when I was using the full length.,31319,2
31319,"When I tried to use the folded style, it got all bunched up and would slide off my jeans.",31319,2
31319,I would recommend purchasing a size up to ensure proper fit.,31319,2
31320,Great Amazon Prime delivery within 2 days.,31320,2
31320,"However, returning product for following reasons: Sizing is off -- barely wide enough to slip on yet toe area way too wide.",31320,2
31320,Soles sturdy.,31320,2
31320,Like upper material but edge stitching to shoe body and sole flimsy.,31320,2
31320,Don't think it will be good for intended purpose--daily use as pool/shower shoe.,31320,2
31320,Returning product for refund!,31320,2
31321,"This blousy is so beautiful, but runs small.",31321,2
31321,I ordered a large (just to be on the safe side) normally I wear a medium size and it was still too tight on me.,31321,2
31321,"I'm 5""4, 155lb.",31321,2
31321,I would recommend ordering 2 size more than what you normally are.,31321,2
31322,I loved the purse.,31322,2
31322,It is roomy and has good pockets.,31322,2
31322,The thread is  coming out though.,31322,2
31322,I haven't had it very long.,31322,2
31323,I ordered a large and had to give it to my friend's 10 year old daughter.,31323,2
31323,Way too small.,31323,2
31324,Cute but put them on and she can't walk.,31324,2

31325,The colors aren't half as vibrant as shown in the photo.,31325,2
31325,Kinda disappointed.,31325,2
31326,"Super cute top, however it fit horribly.",31326,2
31326,the sides were way too large.,31326,2
31326,going to have to pay more in alterations than what the shirt is worth.,31326,2
31327,Cheap rip,31327,2
31328,Entirely too small and could not wear,31328,2
31329,"This product did not work for me , I am carrying very low and the band was too tight for me.",31329,2
31329,It made me very uncomfortable.,31329,2
31329,It did do what it said would kept my jeans up and you couldn't tell they were unbuttoned.,31329,2
31329,I am 5'2 118 pre pregnancy 132 at 32 weeks pregnant.,31329,2
31329,.,31329,2
31329,If you are carrying higher I feel like the product would be fine.,31329,2
31330,I like the pendant design but the first time the ladies I gave them to had a problem.,31330,2
31330,The end of the pendant chain broke off.,31330,2
31330,I had placed two separate orders and received different colors and they were pretty.,31330,2
31330,I contacted the seller but only received an automated computor response .,31330,2
31330,I thew the gifts away and bought two other item which had better quality to give away.,31330,2
31330,I waited several weeks to receive these items..,31330,2
31331,Really wanted to love this.,31331,2
31331,"The satin material feels nice, but it doesn't breathe.",31331,2
31331,"It also fits really awkwardly with the way the neckline is sewed, and it randomly has a pocket on one side which weighs it down makes it hang crooked.",31331,2
31332,I ordered the 0-6 month size for my daughter's 4 month picture at Halloween and was a bit disappointed with it.,31332,2
31332,"It fit her fine for the picture, but is most definitely not the ""high quality"" the description says it is.",31332,2
31332,"I washed it cold and layed flat to dry to make sure it didn't shrink, which it did not.",31332,2
31332,When I took it out of the packaging I noticed the snaps seemed very cheap since the were so hard to get unsnapped.,31332,2
31332,"When I took it out of the wash th first thing I noticed was how much the black lines faded, which shouldn't have happened on a first wash in cold water.",31332,2
31332,Then I saw the rust by the snaps.,31332,2
31332,Definitely doesn't wash well; Super unhappy with this purchase.,31332,2
31333,It looks like an oversized bag,31333,2
31334,Too small from the arms and shoulder.,31334,2
31334,"Body and length of the blouse is okey, but whoever sew this blouse, is being cheap or doesn't know, how
Much cloth materials to use on the arms and shoulder",31334,2
31335,Too small,31335,2
31336,Cheap quality,31336,2
31337,I ordered a 6-12 year size and it would fit a 2 year old.,31337,2
31337,This runs huge!,31337,2
31337,"On a better note, the material is great quality and it is very cute.",31337,2
31337,I can't wait til my son grows in to it!,31337,2
31338,The dress was too long and the material was not as expected.,31338,2
31339,"too small and seller was not willing to refund

dont buy it",31339,2
31340,"Overall, I like the style and design, but the only bad part is the size.",31340,2
31340,I wear S/M hats and this one is way too big on me.,31340,2
31340,I wished the fitting and sizing would be one size but not at all.,31340,2
31341,Kind of a weird material and VERY tiny!!!!,31341,2
31341,Probably would only fit someone women's size 0!,31341,2
31342,I didn't like this bra because of the back straps.,31342,2
31342,The height of the t is not adjustable so many of my shirts and dresses you could see the bra.,31342,2
31342,I opted instead for a clip so that I could adjust and that has worked much better.,31342,2
31342,Otherwise I liked the bra.,31342,2
31343,Too small and unlined....not a fan,31343,2
31344,"Love the texture, so smooth.",31344,2
31344,Fits around my belly but is large in the arms and falls to low off my shoulder for it to have a nice look out in public.,31344,2
31344,Probably be a shirt to lounge in more so.,31344,2
31344,"Pretty sure I ordered a medium, no tag even on it to say asize so not sure what I got.",31344,2
31345,"I'm 34, 28, 40... 5'1 138lbs.",31345,2
31345,Got a large after reading reviews.,31345,2
31345,"Top is way too BIG and bottom is ok, but a little on the smaller side",31345,2
31346,Took a while to get here.,31346,2
31346,Fits a little small and didn't realize that it has no pockets.,31346,2
31346,Material is warm.,31346,2
31347,I'm true to a large and this dress was not a true large.,31347,2
31348,Look as if it was worn before.,31348,2
31348,Came crushed and the color is  pale.,31348,2
31348,It doesn't look like the picture.,31348,2
31349,I'm a size 6-8 in pants and I purchased a large in these leggings in October 2015.,31349,2
31349,I loved them at first but they have since shrunk despite not being cotton.,31349,2
31349,"I have only worn them about 5 times, and they already have a hole and the seam is splitting in the crotch.",31349,2
31349,Don't waste your money on these unless you only need them for a couple of wears.,31349,2
31350,This runs EXTREMELY small in my opinion.,31350,2
31350,Soft materia...but at a size 2 in everything I can vouch this is NOT true to size.,31350,2
31350,Order at least a size (maybe two) up,31350,2
31351,Really wish it would have fit because it was really cute.,31351,2
31351,I wear a 16 pant and ordered xxxl.,31351,2
31352,Not like the previous pelagic hats that had the painted Park up above the brim don't like the black on top,31352,2
31353,The fabric material is soft and nice.,31353,2
31353,However it does not seem to be sewn properly or proportionately.,31353,2
31353,The shoulder seams do not fit where they are suppose to fit.,31353,2
31353,So to wear it I pair it with a belt.,31353,2
31354,Very small cut but nice finish.,31354,2
31354,Was not able to wear it.,31354,2
31355,"Dress has a double layer in the front, but only  one  in the back and the material is very thin, like a thin t-shirt.",31355,2
31355,"The front isn't that bad, but everything shows through in the back because of the one thin layer.",31355,2
31355,It is unforgiving.,31355,2
31355,"I should have returned it earlier, but I thought if  I lost a few pounds it would look better.",31355,2
31355,"I did  lost about 5 pounds, but this dress is just unflattering!",31355,2
31355,"You see the bra straps, panty lines, everything in the back.",31355,2
31355,You have to have a perfect figure to pull this dress off.,31355,2
31355,"If you do, then go ahead and get it.",31355,2
31355,"The material is soft, and it's very comfortable.",31355,2
31356,Fits and ties awkwardly with the Bunchie elastic waist.,31356,2
31356,It's also $15.,31356,2
31357,One broke the first day I wore them and the backs were delivered all smashed.,31357,2
31357,Luckily I ordered two pairs because I was able to get two good backs and 2 that haven't broke (yet),31357,2
31358,"cheap material, it was cute the first time i wore it after that it shrank and the color is more like purple",31358,2
31359,"Case is too tight, encumbering the plug in cord for charging.",31359,2
31359,"Plug-in cord can be plugged in with some effort, but the engineering of the case and its resultant tolerance is not what it should be.",31359,2
31360,not good quality,31360,2
31361,Says its Sterling Silver but looks and feels like Heavy tin.,31361,2
31361,Very light and wrong color for Silver.,31361,2
31361,Was not the quality that it looks like from pictures.,31361,2
31362,"I wear a small, fits more like a medium.",31362,2
31363,i took a size bigger regarding the reviews.,31363,2
31363,Still way too small.,31363,2
31363,"Also, a few defects.",31363,2
31364,"This bag looks very nice, I was looking for a pretty wine colored bag.",31364,2
31364,I had a couple of disappointing issues with it I fortunately.,31364,2
31364,1.,31364,2
31364,"Neither the exterior or interior pocket is large enough for an average sized cell phone, they are oddly small, and 2.",31364,2
31364,The hardware clip on the shoulder strap broke after one week of use.,31364,2
31364,"Unfortunately I didn't start using it right away, so I cannot return or exchange.",31364,2
31364,I will probably give it away or donate.,31364,2
31365,"Just a heads up, they're VERY big....",31365,2
31366,Runs very small,31366,2
31367,These were comfortable and I liked them initially.,31367,2
31367,"However on the second time wearing them, one pair fell apart at the seams.",31367,2
31367,I expected better quality from Hanes.,31367,2
31367,I will be returning these.,31367,2
31368,Shockingly small.,31368,2
31368,I wear a 42 Regular and could barely even get the XL jacket on.,31368,2
31368,I am returning it as it's too small.,31368,2
31368,Seller should review and update the size chart.,31368,2
31369,It feels like a costume.,31369,2
31369,But fits good,31369,2
31370,"I thought I was getting the skater style dress as in the pictures, they sent me a body-hugging dress that was too loose for me and not flattering.",31370,2
31370,"The print is very pretty, despite all of that.",31370,2
31370,I ended up giving it to someone who does wear it well.,31370,2
31371,"while the size fits around the top, the only way this could be a dress (length) is if the person was 5'0"" or shorter.",31371,2
31372,They came in way too small,31372,2
31373,"Don't order Asian clothes unless you weigh 100 lbs, then order a size LARGE!",31373,2
31374,Color is orange not red,31374,2
31375,Medium are very fitted.,31375,2
31375,Other than that quality and print was great.,31375,2
31376,"the lining color was odd, not very natural looking.",31376,2
31376,the dress was just a tad too small for a large.,31376,2
31376,"had it fit better or lining been more nude, i'd have kept it.",31376,2
31376,love the lace and the idea of this dress.,31376,2
31377,Super cute but will only fit your baby,31377,2
31378,I followed advice on a review and ordered a size larger but that was a mistake.,31378,2
31378,It was a little big.,31378,2
31378,"Also being a small 5'1"" but curvy woman I thought that the print didn't line up on my legs right.",31378,2
31378,I did get a second pair with different print and it worked better.,31378,2
31378,So my only advice would be if you happen to be on the shorter side just watch the prints.,31378,2
31378,And order the size pants you normal wear.,31378,2
31378,"But hey they cost under $8 so who cares, someone at the Goodwill will love them I'm sure.",31378,2
31379,I really like this jacket but am disappointed.,31379,2
31379,"This product clearly says ""waterproof"".",31379,2
31379,And it's not.,31379,2
31379,At all.,31379,2
31379,This is more a windbreaker.,31379,2
31379,I live in Oregon.,31379,2
31379,My daughter needs a waterproof coat.,31379,2
31380,Skin tight and itchy,31380,2
31381,I normally wear a large and maybe an extra large depending on how a garment fits around my chest (I am a 36/38 DD) and I ordered the XXL and unfortunately I had to return it because fits like a medium.,31381,2
31381,I have a closet full of dresses and they are all size large - this certainly is NOT correctly and appropriately sized.,31381,2
31381,It's very pretty and seems to be made of moderate quality materials.,31381,2
31381,The lining is a silky/polyester type blend.,31381,2
31382,"After 3 uses, these leggings have ripped in the crotch area.",31382,2
31382,"They're super cute and easy to throw on anywhere and I loved them while they lasted, but I will not be purchasing from this seller again.",31382,2
31382,"The pattern also does not match up like in the picture (The pattern on one leg is higher than the pattern on the other leg, so the pattern doesn't match up when your legs are together), which was only a minor annoyance for me, but I know it may be a turnoff to others.",31382,2
31382,Another thing that I DID like was that they were super warm because of the lining inside!,31382,2
31383,Overall the dress was a disappointment.,31383,2
31383,The sizing of the dress was way off.,31383,2
31383,"Based on the measurements it should have fit, however it was way too small.",31383,2
31383,The material the dress was made out of didn't resemble what I thought it would be based on the picture and description.,31383,2
31383,The material was pretty itchy and not at all comfortable.,31383,2
31383,You would need to definitely wear something under it to make it more comfortable.,31383,2
31383,The color of the dress was correct based on the picture.,31383,2
31383,The scoop neck on the dress would have been difficult to actually get to look like it did in the picture.,31383,2
31383,Because of the material the extra material around the scoop would not sit correctly.,31383,2
31383,It stood out around the edges and did not look like the picture.,31383,2
31383,The size was my biggest issue with the dress.,31383,2
31383,I ordered a 3x...,31383,2
31383,I usually wear a 1 or 2x but I figured if it was too big I would simply take it in.,31383,2
31383,However it did not fit at all.,31383,2
31383,I ended up giving it to a friend who wears a large.,31383,2
31383,It was still too tight for her.,31383,2
31383,Eventually it ended up with another friend who wears a medium.,31383,2
31383,It fit her.,31383,2
31383,I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.,31383,2
31384,poor quality.,31384,2
31384,lint/static friendly.,31384,2
31384,sleeves are bit long.,31384,2
31384,What happened to Hugo Boss?,31384,2
31384,or are these fakes?,31384,2
31385,"Looks very cheap, nothing like I expected",31385,2
31386,arrived very fast but ...Wicked small!!,31386,2
31386,sizing chart is not accurate at all bought one for me and my friend for her b-day and they don't fit either of us...,31386,2
31386,I ordered a 4/6 for my friend and a 8\10 for myself and they super tiny!!!!!,31386,2
31386,Not going to buy from this buyer again.,31386,2
31386,"I can see it not fitting me I'm a curvy person but it didn't even fit my friend who is 130 pounds and 5'7"" who wears a size 4/5!!!",31386,2
31386,not impressed,31386,2
31387,I wore them less than two hours.,31387,2
31387,My ankles have large bruises on both sides/both ankles from the brass knuckles.,31387,2
31387,"The product isn't made very well either as I put a hole in the tip of one of the shoes and I never left the side walk, parking lot or mansion.",31387,2
31388,I am only giving this 2 stars because I was very disappointed in the SIZE of this product.,31388,2
31388,"I ordered an XL because I am a 5'6"" woman that would wear a L-XL because I am tall.",31388,2
31388,These are definitely NOT a full sized woman's size pant.,31388,2
31388,"They are very tiny, more for a teenager size or a Very petit maybe 5' size 0 person.",31388,2
31388,"However, the material is very nice, very soft and smooth and cool feeling and the colors were nice & vivid.",31388,2
31388,They were not really bell bottom type pants that the picture depicts but more straight from top to bottom.,31388,2
31388,I will though give them to a friend to save the hastle of sending them back.,31388,2
31388,I would only recommend these pants to a very small/short petit tiny person.,31388,2
31389,Not a flattering cut.,31389,2
31389,Too blousy and the lace at the top falls in a weird spot.,31389,2
31389,Makes you look heavier than you are.,31389,2
31389,"I ordered a small (5'3"", 123lbs) and it fit, but it looked terrible.",31389,2
31389,Will be returning.,31389,2
31390,The only thing I disliked about these is the star is not a stone it's painted and looks cheap other then that the moon and ready is fine.,31390,2
31391,Shape is fine.,31391,2
31391,"Nice drape, However it runs very small.",31391,2
31391,"And, the material is scratchy.",31391,2
31391,"Not a great purchase for me, at all.",31391,2
31391,Will end up taking it to the thrift shop.,31391,2
31392,The person who wrote this mask is small wasn't kidding.,31392,2
31392,Dont buy this for adults its way to small and there are two small holes in the nose part.,31392,2
31392,I give it two stars bc the mask did look good on the outside.,31392,2
31393,Cute but is only as thick as a shirt.,31393,2
31393,Very very thin,31393,2
31394,"Loved the color, and style, however because of another buyers comments about the shoe being wide,
I ordered my normal size 6 1/2.",31394,2
31394,It fit except for my baby toe did not make it in the strap.,31394,2
31394,"So I figured, if I ordered a larger size, that would work, but stock size 7 was unavailable, so I'm left with a cute shoe that's unwearable.",31394,2
31395,Not happy with quality.,31395,2
31395,"The attached heart chain fell off while my daughter was wearing it and is lost so because of that, I don't believe I can return it since part of it is missing.",31395,2
31395,The part that you twist off to attach the charms consistently comes undone.,31395,2
31395,"The charm that we purchased to have on it is a specialized photo charm of my father in law who just passed away in Sept and my daughter and because I am so afraid of that falling off, we don't allow her to wear the bracelet.",31395,2
31396,IT'S BEAUTIFUL ON THE MODEL BUT IN PERSON IT LOOKS FADED AND THE MATERIAL IS SPANDEX-LIKE,31396,2
31397,This product came and according to customer descriptions was not at all what I was expecting.,31397,2
31397,It has a velvet top part and cheap shiny skirt attached.,31397,2
31397,The bands are thick and bulky not tight and sleek like in pictures on page.,31397,2
31397,The top is not even in the back and bunches up.,31397,2
31397,I ordered this for a Relay for Life event themed Superheroes so since the event is next week I don't have time to return this and find a better costume.,31397,2
31398,The Med (US small) was way too big...the sleeveless version.,31398,2
31398,I am 5'3 123 Ibs... 34-26-37 the top (near the side of breasts) as well as the mid back bunched to leave gaps making the dress look odd.,31398,2
31398,"Not sure if it was just faulty sewing or a size issue, yet reviews said to order a size up & this was the smallest available.",31398,2
31399,Pretty runs a size too small.,31399,2
31400,I loved the concept of this bag.,31400,2
31400,The satin pleating is gorgeous.,31400,2
31400,The color of the satin was a more yellow gold as opposed to a brown/champagne gold but it was still very nice.,31400,2
31400,I ended up returning mine because I couldn't get past the rhinestone patch.,31400,2
31400,It made the bag look very cheap in person.,31400,2
31400,I purchased these for bridesmaids gifts but ended up going with another clutch after receiving them.,31400,2
31401,Super thin and cheaply made.,31401,2
31402,"overpriced and ""rode-up""..which defeated the whole purpose for me.",31402,2
31402,:( returned.,31402,2
31403,Absurdly small,31403,2
31404,Product quality is cheap and not worth buying it.,31404,2
31404,Picture looks good but actual product is cheap quality.,31404,2
31405,Very disappointed with this item.,31405,2
31405,"Though it arrived on time, it did not fit as expected.",31405,2
31405,Also a bracelet was promised along with this item which was never delivered.,31405,2
31406,"size small was to small for me, i use size 4, will give it away",31406,2
31407,I thought this would be more cinching in the middle (hence the picture) but it isn't.,31407,2
31407,It fits around my waist just fine but there aren't enough columns of hooks to make any difference.,31407,2
31408,Not exactly the length I expected!,31408,2
31408,Good for short legged girls.,31408,2
31409,I expected the dress to be a little longer as was shown in the picture.,31409,2
31410,Really cute...but broke really easy...,31410,2
31411,It is very short.,31411,2
31411,I'm only 5'2 and it fits like a crop top.,31411,2
31411,You'd have to be a midget to wear it.,31411,2
31412,Very thin for burp cloths.,31412,2
31412,Would have to double for diaper.,31412,2
31413,The eyehooks in the front area to hold the front closed pulled off the second I put them together.,31413,2
31414,"it looks cheep, not at all like the picture.",31414,2
31414,It came in a plastic bag which is fine but it was wadded up and wrinkled.,31414,2
31415,They didn't hold up to six months of daily use.,31415,2
31415,The velcro gave out.,31415,2
31416,"The size, shape, and pockets are excellent for storage.",31416,2
31416,"However, one of the pannier clips fell off the first week I owned the bag, and the bag fell into the street as I was cycling.",31416,2
31417,"I didn't expect much because of the cheap price, but the two metal pieces that hold the watch flap down after it is buckled in are loose, which makes no sense.",31417,2
31417,They fall down and slide all over the watch.,31417,2
31417,"Also, the strap is very inflexible so its really hard to buckle it in once it's on.",31417,2
31417,I returned this strap because it wasn't of good quality.,31417,2
31418,Material looks cheap and does not have clean finish.,31418,2
31418,Shirt and bow looked terrible.,31418,2
31418,Jacket was okay.,31418,2
31418,I returned the whole set though.,31418,2
31419,"Cute print, but the neck is too big causing it to not fit well.",31419,2
31420,"Initial fit was ok, but the fabric had no real body.",31420,2
31420,By mid day the moved from my waist to mid hip.,31420,2
31420,By evening I could use it as a night shirt.,31420,2
31421,disappointed.,31421,2
31421,it doesn't stay belted.,31421,2
31421,slips right off,31421,2
31422,The attached slip underneath is 2 sizes smaller than the dress.,31422,2
31422,Sending this back.,31422,2
31423,Thought if I bought bigger theyd be longer but no luck.,31423,2
31423,"Still too short for my 5'10"" daughter.",31423,2
31424,"Very pretty & cute concept, but I had to give them away, they were too small for my shoe size 8 foot.",31424,2
31425,they run small,31425,2
31426,"The design is attached at least partially with hot glue, and the end of the ribbon appears to be coming undone.",31426,2
31426,"good idea, but only so-so production",31426,2
31427,It is a well-made shirt but too small for me.,31427,2
31428,It was not the right fit runs a bit small,31428,2
31429,Seems like decent quality other than the large hole near the armpit.,31429,2
31429,Will be returning.,31429,2
31429,Too bad because it's cute!,31429,2
31430,The designs are not as shown on the pics.,31430,2
31431,runs small,31431,2
31432,Nice but they don't stretch at all really.,31432,2
31433,"Runs very small,  msy want to order at least 2 sizes up, Im  med/lg  and ordered xl and was just a bit snug.",31433,2
31433,"But I like it, looks great with jeans, good casual summer top, can beat the price",31433,2
31434,"Very nice clutch type bag, however the zipper was slightly undone when it arrived, otherwise not bad",31434,2
31435,"The description said it was 90% cotton, but it's 95%  polyester when I received it.",31435,2
31435,"I'm allergic to polyester, so I wouldn't have purchased it.",31435,2
31436,"I am 5'3"" 110lbs and got the small and it's too big.",31436,2
31436,The sleeves go past my knuckles and it's just really shapeless and doesn't hang right like it does in the picture.,31436,2
31436,"The material is super thick, which is nice but I think it's the reason it hangs kind of funny.",31436,2
31436,Maybe washing it would help?,31436,2
31436,"Not sure, I'm going to give it to my friend who is a bit taller and larger than me, but if you're my size, don't get it.",31436,2
31436,I also was a bit put off that the stripes on the side at the hem were so misaligned.,31436,2
31437,"I read reviews that this shirt runs small, but still did not realize quite how small.",31437,2
31437,"I ordered an XL for my someone who is 5'4"", 150lbs, C cup and usually wears M-L but it was still too small - should have gone for XXL, which is crazy.",31437,2
31437,Order up at least two sizes!,31437,2
31438,"I love the jacket but once again, I was fooled by asian sizing.",31438,2
31438,Will be more careful in the future.,31438,2
31439,Small color not even close to picture and has cutouts on shoulders that you can't see in pictures,31439,2
31440,"2 stars for quick service, and receiving a dress at all...",31440,2
31440,I did not receive the dress as desired in the image.,31440,2
31440,"The size and color I needed was being restocked at the time I placed the order and wouldn't have shipped until next week, just two days before the wedding that I will be attending as bridesmaid.",31440,2
31440,"I received a dress early today to my pleasant surprise, but to my dismay was not what I chose; I wanted the sweetheart type top, as in the pictures in the preview and other purchasers' photos.",31440,2
31440,I've instead received this dress by Maggie Tang with a drastically different top section with the big triangle cut front and back and the wide sleeves.,31440,2
31440,"The color was right, and the fit was okay...",31440,2
31440,I also received this thin black belt along with it.,31440,2
31440,"Unfortunately, the belt would not fasten correctly (I was able to rig it in my pictures lol).",31440,2
31440,I am grateful for the quick service so that I might see if I know anybody who can tailor the top to my needs or find another dress that fits me better within a week.,31440,2
31441,I was very excited to receive this maxi dress for a tropical vacation.,31441,2
31441,Very disappointed.,31441,2
31441,"The color and pattern is fine, and the materials seem decent...nice and flowy, light, well lined.",31441,2
31441,"But there is absolutely NO WAY that what I received is a size 4X, despite what the package says.",31441,2
31441,ALL of my clothes are either 4x or 3x and they fit well.,31441,2
31441,I couldn't even get this over my head and shoulders.,31441,2
31442,The inside of the straps is a plastic material and not comfortable.,31442,2
31442,I would not suggest them to anyone.,31442,2
31443,This is way too small and shorter than I expected.,31443,2
31444,"CANT QUITE VIEW THE SCREEN AT AN ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES, NEEDS TO BE VIEWED HEAD ON

BAD VIEWING ANGLES",31444,2
31445,The plastic stripped after a couple weeks so the bottom doesnt screw on.,31445,2
31446,"A little tight at first, but the leather has stretched out perfectly.",31446,2
31446,Super useful - I love how you can put cards in the middle compartment (I had a Fossil version of this wallet that you couldn't fit cards in the middle slot).,31446,2
31446,High quality and the magnet is strong too.,31446,2
31446,UPDATE: Started falling apart after just a few weeks use.,31446,2
31446,Returning.,31446,2
31446,It's unfortunate because I really liked the design of this wallet.,31446,2
31447,"Everything was great about these except the stitching isn't strong on the inside ""medical grade silicone"" panel.",31447,2
31447,Stitching started to come undone and I haven't been able to get a response in a replacement pair yet.,31447,2
31448,Arrived broken and obviously cheap.,31448,2
31448,"Luckily, my daughter was amused by the bracelet they also included and wore it instead.",31448,2
31448,"Plan on wearing it only a few times, if you are lucky.",31448,2
31449,"I've never bought a one size legging that didn't fit, until I bought these.",31449,2
31449,"I'm a size 12, and tall.",31449,2
31449,"The length was fine but they were so tight, they were almost painful to wear.",31449,2
31449,"I will say the quality is great, thick and nice matte not shiny at all.",31449,2
31449,Just extremely tight.,31449,2
31450,Fine but much pretty in the picture,31450,2
31451,Looks cheap.,31451,2
31452,sizes run very small,31452,2
31453,"My granddaughter is just 10 years old, and not overweight.",31453,2
31453,I bought the size 12 to allow for some room to grow.,31453,2
31453,I now have to get it exchanged for a larger size.,31453,2
31454,it made my shape look like a sponge .,31454,2
31454,"it pushed it to far in the air , it does not look natural",31454,2
31455,This dress is enormous - definitely order down a size or two (don't even pay attention to the sizing chart).,31455,2
31455,"However, I would not recommend anyone to actually order this because in person, the material feels just like a cheap Halloween costume out of a supermarket package (stiff and almost plastic-like - similar to a shower curtain).",31455,2
31455,"The pattern is pretty, but the colors were not as dark/rich as in the photos.",31455,2
31456,"Really poor quality - you can see the green putty where each flower is attached and the photo looks more floral than the real item, which has fewer flowers and looks more golden wiring.",31456,2
31457,Usually an xs got a medium and still to tight,31457,2
31458,"Now, not-polarized is one thing.",31458,2
31458,But it's actually more difficult to see with these on than off in sufficient sunlight.,31458,2
31458,"Seriously, the glare is almost impressive.",31458,2
31458,These also broke on me fairly quickly.,31458,2
31458,"They look alright though, which is why I'm assuming you are checking them out in the first place.",31458,2
31458,"If ya just want a cheap fashion accessory, and have no expectations for longevity or functionality, you could probably do worse.",31458,2
31459,This was very small for me.,31459,2
31459,I ordered an xl and it didn't even fit my 16 year old daughter.,31459,2
31459,The seller asked if I could keep it and get 1/2 back as it was too hard for both of us to try to do the return.,31459,2
31460,In many ways I really like this bag.,31460,2
31460,It has the best configuration of places to put things - extremely well designed in that manner.,31460,2
31460,"BUT the material used is very stiff and inflexible, so it makes it hard to access things.",31460,2
31460,It is also not soft to the touch.,31460,2
31460,Also the strap is too wide and the way it is attached with the rectangular metal bracket allows the strap to move and then it gets bunched - would be much better if they used a round ring.,31460,2
31461,"Loved the color and cool material, however runsure ways to small.",31461,2
31461,Definitely not the same length as the picture.,31461,2
31462,The arms were a little tight in the Medium size.,31462,2
31462,And medium usually fits me well.,31462,2
31462,Also the color is off putting.,31462,2
31462,It's sort of an orangey brown rust color.,31462,2
31462,Not what I was expecting.,31462,2
31462,I returned it.,31462,2
31463,It gives very firm stretch that would shape you nicely without strangling you...except it won't stay at all.,31463,2
31463,It rolls immediately and will not stay up at all.,31463,2
31463,I sew so I plan to sew in some boning where ever there are seams to give it some stay up support.,31463,2
31463,It will probably make a great shaper to workout in because it can give good support while letting you breathe.,31463,2
31464,Would of been pretty if it fit.,31464,2
31464,"I ordered 4 other rompers from other companies same size that fit perfectly, this one ran small.",31464,2
31465,"The product was exactly as I hoped, yet the size was not even close to what was conveyed.",31465,2
31465,My daughter is a 10-12 size at age 9.,31465,2
31465,These garments showed a 10 Youth in the sizing and yet the arrive as a 10 Toddler.,31465,2
31465,I have raised two kids and never have heard of a 10T.,31465,2
31465,The size does not fit with the label on the garment.,31465,2
31465,"It's possibly my nieces can wear them, yet the pants are long enough for my 9yr old daughter and the matching top would maybe fit a 6yr old.",31465,2
31465,Soft and pretty garment but unfortunate sizing conveyed.,31465,2
31466,Unfortunately these did not fit our suitcase (a seemingly a normal size bag) and we only found out at the airport when we tried to secure them.,31466,2
31466,"We were able to them around the case widthwise and send it out like that, though the issue with our case is its integrity lengthwise.",31466,2
31466,I'd caution others to check their luggage dimensions.,31466,2
31466,The straps are admittedly of good quality and given more generous webbing I'd likely be writing a glowing review.,31466,2
31467,This jacket has a very nice design but I was disappointed when I found out that the material was very flimsy,31467,2
31468,"This dress was VERY well made, but way too small.",31468,2
31468,I ordered two sizes larger and it was still two sizes too small.,31468,2
31468,I normally wear a US size 6 but I bought a size 10 and I couldn't get it on at all.,31468,2
31468,Make SURE you order a few sizes above your normal size or you won't be able to fit this style.,31468,2
31468,"As you can see from my pics, a size 8 or 10 SHOULD have been more than enough material.",31468,2
31468,"Unfortunately, it wasn't.",31468,2
31469,These were very thin and the legs were HUGE.,31469,2
31469,I have naturally thicker legs from dance and soccer and I thought they were going to be flattering but they are just bulky and the lace is heavy at the bottom.,31469,2
31469,Not flattering or really flattering.,31469,2
31470,"Too tacky, fabric, shape, officer disk.",31470,2
31471,I ordered this for my daughter because I LOVED the plaid bear on the front.,31471,2
31471,"However, the material is very cheap; it ripped the first time I put it on her.",31471,2
31471,It is not thick sweatshirt material...it's on the thinner side.,31471,2
31471,I am not happy about the rip.,31471,2
31471,It's right in the back where you  have to pull it through to the diaper.,31471,2
31472,It fits well but the colors faded drastically on the first wash.,31472,2
31473,I got product within the time stated but sizes run at least 2 sizes too small.,31473,2
31474,They were cute but too small for my niece.,31474,2
31474,Also they had a smell like painting material were used on it.,31474,2
31474,It could be because of the face on the right leg.,31474,2
31474,"Even if it would have fit her, I would have returned it only for that reason.",31474,2
31475,"I brought a size large, but I usually wear a medium.",31475,2
31475,I went up a size and got the large.,31475,2
31475,which should have fit fine with a little extra room.,31475,2
31475,This shirt fit like a small.,31475,2
31475,I should have gotten the XL.,31475,2
31475,The color was off should have been dark blue not indigo blue.,31475,2
31476,It's an awesome product.,31476,2
31476,I'm a size 12 in pants and I ordered an XL.,31476,2
31476,Everything fits perfect except the thighs.,31476,2
31476,The piece that goes under your butt and around your legs (the lace part).,31476,2
31476,Is tight.,31476,2
31476,Not Ment for women with thick thighs.,31476,2
31476,It digs in.,31476,2
31476,If it weren't for that it'd be 5 stars.,31476,2
31477,This blouse has a funny fit.,31477,2
31477,"It looks nice when my arms are down as shown in the picture, but as soon as I raise my arms at all, it hikes up in the bust area 6 inches.",31477,2
31477,It just won't work.,31477,2
31477,"Too bad too, I thought it was really cute.",31477,2
31478,the dress is nice but the top side is too long.,31478,2
31478,so when I try to adjust it by pulling everything down then the bottom look weird.,31478,2
31478,when I wear it as in the picture then the top is too big.,31478,2
31478,otherwise it is okay.,31478,2
31479,"The image is not the same as the product I received, the front of the cardigan in the image seems like it covers much more than the cardigan I received.",31479,2
31479,"The front panels of the cardigan do not even cover my chest, and I am not a large individual nor do I have a particularly large chest.",31479,2
31479,"I expected it would also be longer - it does not come past my hips or drape down very far in the front, and I am not a tall individual either (5'1).",31479,2
31479,Colors also do not match the print on the sleeves.,31479,2
31480,I disagree that you should order 1-2 sizes larger.,31480,2
31480,I am pretty petite.,31480,2
31480,I usually wear a small or occasionally medium due to my broad shoulders (medium in Old Navy perfect tee).,31480,2
31480,I ordered a medium and it is too big.,31480,2
31480,"Further, it appears to be ruched in the photo but is not in life so, on me, it just hangs in a most unflattering fashion.",31480,2
31480,I really wanted to like it but just don't.,31480,2
31481,These are pretty see through in the back unfortunately,31481,2
31482,Too big,31482,2
31483,"I know that I should not have expected anything stellar, but I am disappointed.",31483,2
31483,"The color is great (it's actually a darker green than what is shown, but still a really nice green); the quality of the fabric is just fine for the price (I work with Pre-K students, I didn't want anything high-quality).",31483,2
31483,"It is a comfortable, oversized fit (size S, I'm 5'8, B-cup).",31483,2
31483,"However, the collar is so terribly and unevenly sewn that I don't think I'll ever wear it out of the house.",31483,2
31483,It is incredibly obvious and looks bizarre.,31483,2
31484,It just didn't hang right.,31484,2
31484,I thought it was so cute but it just wasn't when it was on.,31484,2
31485,NOT 20 gauge at all.,31485,2
31486,followed size chart and these are too small - unacceptable for what they cost.,31486,2
31486,"the 'string' always tangles especially when removing them, which is very annoying trying to then untangle them.",31486,2
31486,"however, style is nice.",31486,2
31487,The earrings i received barely resemble the earrings in the picture.,31487,2
31487,"The picture shows a row of pink crystals surrounding the center stone, with clear crystals surrounding the pink.",31487,2
31487,"Further, the overall shape is quite different than that pictured, I ordered platinum plated, and they are definitely not.",31487,2
31488,They wil ok for a backup pair but not that crazy about the placement of the bi-focal...it's higher that I feel it should be and makes it hard to see objects farther away.,31488,2
31489,too flowing,31489,2
31490,The tassels aren't secure at the bottom.. they're weaved into the seam and come out easily.. it looks like the picture though..,31490,2
31491,RETURNED ITEM,31491,2
31492,Ordered a medium and I'm not that big in the waist.,31492,2
31492,Way to tight where it is to uncomfortable to wear.,31492,2
31492,Maybe an extra large would fit me.,31492,2
31493,regular,31493,2
31494,Size too large and the Velcro does not help,31494,2
31495,"fabric was very flimsy, didn't think it would hold to well, disappointed",31495,2
31496,Let me start by saying this item was too small for me and I am returning it for a bigger size.,31496,2
31496,The reason for the low review has nothing to do with this.,31496,2
31496,2 star review is because when I opened the package to try the item on it had an overwhelming smell of stale cigarettes!,31496,2
31496,Not exactly what you want to smell from an item you're expecting to be new.,31496,2
31497,Green is actually a coating that breaks after awhile,31497,2
31498,Very small leg holes.. didn't work for  us,31498,2
31499,Comfy jammies.,31499,2
31499,"Great, after I repaired the defective metal 'claws' at the bottom of the zipper.",31499,2
31499,"Had this not been an issue, this would have been 5 stars.",31499,2
31500,"I ordered a larger size, as previous reviews suggested, but not enough coverage on sides of bust area.",31500,2
31501,"way to big and long I am 5' 2""",31501,2
31502,The face mask doesn't fit well!,31502,2
31502,Too small for me.,31502,2
31502,Can't barely wear the face mask.,31502,2
31502,(My face is regular size!),31502,2
31503,Ordered a 5/6 bc my daughter is in a 6 in EVERYTHING.. And this was hugeeee on her.,31503,2
31503,The bikini line also comes up too high onto her little hips like an adult bikini.,31503,2
31504,I bought an XL & they fit like a Large.,31504,2
31504,I sold them to a co-worker for what I paid for them.,31504,2
31504,"... Also, both my co-worker & I agree, they need a cargo pocket(s).",31504,2
31505,Way to small.,31505,2
31505,Hurt my lip badly.,31505,2
31505,Left a bruise,31505,2
31506,I bought it tried loving it but it just doesn't work too well.,31506,2
31506,It's very rough and shifts up after a long time wear.,31506,2
31506,It did absolutely nothing for me.,31506,2
31507,The silicone is much thicker than others I've used.,31507,2
31507,The ends flare out too wide  (the depth of the tunnel) causing it to stick out noticeably instead of remaining flush with the ear.,31507,2
31508,Low quality,31508,2
31509,"Though the tag says 3xl, and that is one size larger that my wife wears, it is WAY too mall through the chest and bodice.",31509,2
31509,Not even close.,31509,2
31509,She is ample but certainly not overly so.,31509,2
31509,"The dress is beautiful, but completely unusable.",31509,2
31510,I ordered a size larger than normal.,31510,2
31510,Would have to order 3 or more sizes larger to fit.,31510,2
31510,Very very small.,31510,2
31511,The band it self is nice looking.,31511,2
31511,The latch is junk I cannot get it to stay latched and my watch falls off.,31511,2
31512,Sleeves were too short,31512,2
31513,"I ordered a size large (I'm usually a medium,) & the front of the short still hangs a little short (I also have a short torso.)",31513,2
31514,Way too short!,31514,2
31514,"I am 5'1"" 150 lbs.",31514,2
31514,I bought this dress in a large.,31514,2
31514,"It fit, but barely cleared my butt.",31514,2
31514,"I have a bit of an ass, but not enough to warrant the shortness.",31514,2
31514,"Again, I am 5'1""!",31514,2
31514,Nothing should be this short for someone my height.,31514,2
31514,"I would only recommend this dress for someone who is under 5' and slender, maybe it would work.",31514,2
31515,"Cheap material, not a sweater as it appears.",31515,2
31516,The fabric is not sheer as in the photograph.,31516,2
31516,The arm holes are very snugs; wouldi fit a Pre-teen easily.,31516,2
31516,I bought this for my daughters lingerie party.,31516,2
31516,Size six...... probably will not fit.,31516,2
31517,"The colors are very nice, but it doesn't go with my skin tone (make it look pale) and also the bottom part has an opening that might get you in troubles if you don't realize it.",31517,2
31517,Probably best options for slimmer females.,31517,2
31517,Thanks,31517,2
31518,I ordered the correct size.,31518,2
31518,But still was small around my chest area.,31518,2
31518,I don't have large boobs.,31518,2
31518,Normal.,31518,2
31518,But still tight.,31518,2
31518,The sleeves made me look like a Latin dancer.,31518,2
31518,Too poofy.,31518,2
31519,I loved them they are men's but I bought them.,31519,2
31519,Love them !,31519,2
31520,"I guess I will keep it, but very disappointed in the product.",31520,2
31520,Runs very small and doesn't seem like very good quality.,31520,2
31521,"Gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift, she really likes it, and the wide straps make it quite comfortable on your shoulders.",31521,2
31521,"This is an update on this backpack:
My daughter has been using this item since January and the zippers have failed, They don't keep closed, they open in the middle once you zip them closed.",31521,2
31521,I believe that being a backpack that gets a lot of use as the students would give it it should have sturdier or industrial zippers that can withhold the constant open/close.,31521,2
31521,Very disappointing!!!,31521,2
31521,It is too late to return and now I have to pay for someone to change the zippers.,31521,2
31521,"I would think it over if you buy this item to go to college and put books in, and make sure you don't give it too much use.",31521,2
31521,"And by the way, this backpack was not stuffed for the zippers to have a problem of closing and keeping closed.",31521,2
31521,"I will try another brand, pity because we really liked the wide shoulder straps, maybe if the vendor decides to address this issue we would consider trying this backpack again.",31521,2
31521,"Looking on the brighter side, it was good while it lasted.",31521,2
31521,Sorry.,31521,2
31522,very cheaply made with the lace stitching looking like the seams are on the wrong sides -- I'm usually a 4-6 and had to order and XL so it was just fine for my size - but I never order XL's unless it's coming from China,31522,2
31523,"clasp keeps popping open, Boooo",31523,2
31524,"they are rather heavy, what I really don't like  they do not match .",31524,2
31524,coins are different.,31524,2
31524,postage too much to return but for  price  ok I guess,31524,2
31525,The left ear stem separated from the lens frame the fourth time I wore them.,31525,2
31525,It looks like the stem hinge wasn't proper set in the frame.,31525,2
31525,It's a shame since these are good looking sunglasses.,31525,2
31526,ok.... fake tie looks kind of cheap,31526,2
31527,I liked the fabric but the fit was not good.,31527,2
31527,"I am 5' 3"" therefore I would like to find another brad that would fit me.",31527,2
31528,I bought those after reading an article about the best cordless headphones.,31528,2
31528,I am an average Jane who needs a manual to set things up.,31528,2
31528,"This product came with a little folded piece of paper & nano print (you almost need a magnifying glass to read it) and I attempted pairing it with my IPhone 6...I don't know if I succeeded...they do not work, for this reason or other.",31528,2
31528,"There is no info here on whether I need to set up the phone to accept the pairing...it's all written in Chinese English, not very helpful.",31528,2
31528,I am going to try and Google trouble shooting (this thing does not offer advise on what to do if the pairing is unsuccessful) and if not - I will have to return those.,31528,2
31528,These could be bought cheaper from outside Amazon but I was afraid of a Chinese product that might need to be returned and Amazon is wonderful about that.,31528,2
31529,This item runs small in size.,31529,2
31529,if you are a medium the large size will still be too small.,31529,2
31529,"This item is best to be bought at the store,  to have the chance to try it before buying it.",31529,2
31529,So i do not recommend it.,31529,2
31530,I have a fairly fall 5 year old.,31530,2
31530,These go up to her armpits.,31530,2
31530,Literally.,31530,2
31530,They will work but yikes.,31530,2
31531,"The pattern is cool, but the cut is very odd.",31531,2
31531,The sleeves are VERY large - much wider than pictured.,31531,2
31531,"Andy Reid would probably love it, but unfortunately it's not for me.",31531,2
31532,"Save your money....it is MUCH prettier in the photo, it runs small and if I had seen it in a store, I never would have bought it.",31532,2
31533,Zipper broke within six months.,31533,2
31534,This dress is super cute..,31534,2
31534,But I normally wear a medium sometimes a large.,31534,2
31534,And the large and extra large were both very tight and unattractive.,31534,2
31534,I don't recommend this dress.,31534,2
31535,"I ordered small, but it was too big.",31535,2
31535,The flowers in the center were yellow and not white like on the picture.,31535,2
31535,I'm not sure if we're keeping it.,31535,2
31536,"Looks like it would work as it should but if you are bigger than a B, it won't work with the underwire.",31536,2
31537,Had to return.,31537,2
31537,Followed the sizing guide and it was basically a laundry bag over me.,31537,2
31538,I've recently been looking for summer clothing and need to keep covered better.,31538,2
31538,"I want long sleeves, light and flowing fabric, loose fit.",31538,2
31538,"The description fit what I was looking for perfectly, but then I got it.",31538,2
31538,This shrunk when washed.,31538,2
31538,"Not so much that I can't wear it, but enough that I have to stretch it back out.",31538,2
31538,That's not what I spent my money for.,31538,2
31538,"It says it's made of gauze, but feels and acts more like that thicker, crinkly rayon that shrinks when you wash it.",31538,2
31538,Hmm...,31538,2
31539,The colors are not true to the computer image.,31539,2
31539,My dress is not nearly as vibrant as shown.,31539,2
31539,Disappointed.,31539,2
31540,"That are way to large for my face, they won't stay on my face.",31540,2
31541,The leg holes are way too tight on my thighs (I'm a size 10).,31541,2
31541,Very uncomfortable.,31541,2
31542,ok,31542,2
31543,ordered 2 of these and had to return both.,31543,2
31543,first one was too large and the second did not fit well.,31543,2
31543,the sides of this suit is cut very narrow and long on the sides with not enough support.,31543,2
31543,cute suit but not for me!,31543,2
31544,Unhappy with quality.,31544,2
31544,Shirt fit very awkward and the print was not straight.,31544,2
31545,Very small,31545,2
31546,It was a little big my normal ring size is 5 it doesn't fit properly.,31546,2
31546,It also turned my finger green.,31546,2
31547,All the pompoms keep falling off!,31547,2
31547,:(,31547,2
31548,This was too small and I even ordered a larger size that what I wear.,31548,2
31549,Looks awesome in the picture.,31549,2
31549,Purchased for my granddaughter.,31549,2
31549,Opened it as soon as it arrived and was so disappointed.,31549,2
31549,Hard stiff fabric...looked so cheap.,31549,2
31549,And the fringe is Nothing like it looks in the picture.,31549,2
31549,It's very short on sides and in the front and so stiff it was almost hard.,31549,2
31549,Just looked like a very cheap boot.,31549,2
31550,The legs are way too long and the fit is small and strange,31550,2
31551,cheap material- but it'll do,31551,2
31552,The material is good but it runs big.,31552,2
31552,It's deal for somebody who is size 6 and up.,31552,2
31553,These are meant for some little ass dudes.,31553,2
31553,if you are packin you will feel violated by these.,31553,2
31553,way too small literally can't move my junk in these bout to throw em in the trash lol look awesome tho.,31553,2
31553,Super Small for little ass people 4 foot and under,31553,2
31554,Good build but wayyyy too small.,31554,2
31554,The s/m looked as if it was child sized.,31554,2
31554,I picked up that size since that has always been my fit for every hat I purchase.,31554,2
31554,If you end up buying this hat get the bigger size.,31554,2
31554,"I'm personally not bothering to get another size, I'm way too disappointed.",31554,2
31555,"Ordered this 3 pack, only 2 pair came.",31555,2
31555,"The black and the white pair, no clear set.",31555,2
31555,"Also, one of the black pair was ripped.",31555,2
31555,So the 3 pack became a 1 pack of white only.,31555,2
31555,"Quality is good and as advertised, shame I didn't get the full order.",31555,2
31556,My husband love his ring but I ordered a size 13 and it's a little big for his finger.,31556,2
31556,All his other rings are 13 and fit perfectly.,31556,2
31556,It's beautiful but he will need a ring guard.,31556,2
31556,"Now it's changing colors, if you really want to show love get the real deal both rings from this supplier were headaches and I don't want a replacement",31556,2
31557,Isn't as long as I expected,31557,2
31558,I love the first picture of that thick fabric warm cozy sweater - don't know where the modle got that one from....,31558,2
31558,"This thing is thin and not as cozy, warm or magical.... also has oddly cut sleeves -.-
Would not reccomend",31558,2
31559,Looks really cool but already broke.,31559,2
31560,"Great glasses, but when I received them, they were badly scratched on the left lense.",31560,2
31560,Too distracting to wear because of that.,31560,2
31560,Kind of a waste of $18.,31560,2
31561,Super small bought 3x ended up not fitting my 12 year old stepdaughter either,31561,2
31562,Not really,31562,2
31563,hard to get in and fastened.,31563,2
31564,I bought these pants to wear while working out.,31564,2
31564,They fit a little tighter than I imagimed they would be.,31564,2
31564,The look is cute.,31564,2
31564,"However, for wearing them for workouts they don't stay put very well around the waist area.",31564,2
31565,Super cute!,31565,2
31565,WAY too small!,31565,2
31566,The elephant charm came off as soon as I put it on.,31566,2
31566,And the material is cheap.,31566,2
31567,Looks as cheap as it is....no point sending it back....I'll actually lose money doing so.,31567,2
31568,Expect a lot of shrinkage especially in length,31568,2
31569,This product needs to have better sizing charts.,31569,2
31569,The product came very late.,31569,2
31569,Later than expected and it was considerably smaller than what the sizing chart said would be the appropriate size.,31569,2
31570,Decent price for what you get.,31570,2
31570,I saw the exact same wig new at Value Village for the same price this year.,31570,2
31570,The curls are far from being that perfects and precise but it works for a clown wig.,31570,2
31571,It's a beautiful dress.,31571,2
31571,But this isn't chiffon.,31571,2
31571,It's a parachute material and makes that noise when you walk.,31571,2
31572,the hand display is not working,31572,2
31573,Love the style and colors but way too small....,31573,2
31574,Followed size chart and cross referenced customer reviews - ordered a XL as I am bigger busted but the tummy part was enormous and the sleeves were tight.,31574,2
31574,Not a flattering fit.,31574,2
31574,Disappointed and returning this..  Also the seam in the neck had fuzzy string popping out of the seam - not well made.,31574,2
31575,"Smaller tan photo,!",31575,2
31576,You get what you pay for.,31576,2
31576,This bracelet is very cute but it broke very easily.,31576,2
31576,"Also, the clasp was on backwards so it was extremely difficult to put on without assistance.",31576,2
31577,The watch stop instantly did not last a day,31577,2
31578,The blouse is a pretty design and the color is also.,31578,2
31578,But was way too big and it wrinkles very easily.,31578,2
31579,Cheaply made.,31579,2
31580,"Cute patterns, belt was made from cheap material and if you're a tall girl (like me), get a size or two bigger than what you usually get.",31580,2
31580,It was too short for me.,31580,2
31580,Couldn't wear it out.,31580,2
31581,has reflection on the inside of the lenses causing sight problems in direct sun light.,31581,2
31582,Not all that impressed.,31582,2
31582,"I wasn't expecting high quality, since It's an inexpensive costume, but we didn't get the glasses at all, and they smashed the hat into a flat box for shipping- so it is completely misshaped.",31582,2
31582,I tried to manipulate it back into shape for my husband to wear to a Gatsby party.,31582,2
31582,"It'll work, I  guess, but the costume pieces I got for me look much better.",31582,2
31582,"I'd exchange it, but I have no reason to believe they won't do the same stupid shipping the second time around, and the $1 glasses aren't worth the hassle.",31582,2
31582,Won't be buying from this company again.,31582,2
31583,not what i expected,31583,2
31584,"I usually wear XL everything, so I was a bit thrown off when I noticed their sizing.",31584,2
31584,I ordered a XXXL since that's what the size chart led me to.,31584,2
31584,I am so sad to say that I can't even button this up.,31584,2
31584,It's so frustrating that they only go up to XXXL too.,31584,2
31584,Guess I'll be returning it and looking for something else.,31584,2
31585,The jeans are pretty nice for the price.,31585,2
31585,The only reason I Gave them 2 stars are cause the pants are way too big for me.,31585,2
31585,I wear a size 0 in all my jeans but for some reason these size 0 jeans are way to big for me.,31585,2
31585,And when I wear them with a belt then it looks all scrunched up at the waist.,31585,2
31586,I am big busted and this shirt wasn't long enough to my liking.,31586,2
31587,Even with Velcro it doesn't stay closed.,31587,2
31587,Waste of money.,31587,2
31588,Material is very comfortable although not a fan of the pouch.,31588,2
31588,It's too confining and uncomfortable.,31588,2
31588,I tried cutting it off but ended up just throwing the whole underwear out.,31588,2
31589,"run real small just about cover up, nice material, would be really nice if sizing chart was close!!",31589,2
31589,!,31589,2
31590,"looks different in person and the top part is longer than it looks,meaning that it goes lower than just the bust, so doesn't create the empire waist look like in the pic.",31590,2
31590,The sizing is off too...,31590,2
31590,"I can wear an 18 and even a 16 in most gowns, but this 18 I couldn't even zip up and the under layer was REALLY tight.",31590,2
31590,Some of the chiffon was ripped and the stitching had come out in several places.,31590,2
31590,Didn't feel like it was well made and returned it.,31590,2
31591,The product is great.,31591,2
31591,This was a prime item and it took two weeks to get here.,31591,2
31591,I missed the event I needed it for.,31591,2
31592,Shirt is ok ok neck and sleeve but the body is too big,31592,2
31593,Cute but not for sensitive skin.,31593,2
31593,I've had my  piercing for 16 years.,31593,2
31593,"The first week I wore it everything was fine, but then it became infected overnight.",31593,2
31593,I can't wear it at all.,31593,2
31594,I was expecting shoes that light up and these definitely don't!,31594,2
31594,Quality seems okay but they're not everything as advertised.,31594,2
31594,They seem a little small but that could be a size difference coming from what I assume is China.,31594,2
31595,Socks were a little small,31595,2
31596,"I'm 5'9"" and 220 lbs.",31596,2
31596,I bought this dress in a large and it was too tight overall.,31596,2
31596,I love the length of it.,31596,2
31596,The material didn't have much stretch or leeway to it.,31596,2
31596,I do have a large bust and am a curvy women and know that if I had an XL or XXL then it would of fit better.,31596,2
31597,runs very small almost like juniors...I did order up.,31597,2
31597,"also fabric is silky, picture really makes it seem like it might be more cotton blend, especially if you review the picture of the model.",31597,2
31597,I'd return it if I had paid more.,31597,2
31597,Not worth the effort.,31597,2
31598,I'm a size 4-6 and this was too small at the waist.,31598,2
31598,Quite uncomfortable.,31598,2
31598,Will be returning.,31598,2
31599,"These are really large and if you wear them with the ""smile"" in the downward position, they show from the front.",31599,2
31599,Very disappointed.,31599,2
31599,Probably should return them but don't have the time right now.,31599,2
31600,"too large, I am a ""L"" in US size, so I ordered the 18, it was much too large",31600,2
31601,Could not get this one to clip on and stay.,31601,2
31602,"The stones were not all authentic, the bracelets run small.",31602,2
31602,"Packaging was excellent, nothing came broken.",31602,2
31602,Overall good buy but not for the price.,31602,2
31602,I would really prefer the authentic stones for the price.,31602,2
31603,I have a spot on the back of mine.,31603,2
31603,It almost looks like when they died the brown it dripped on the back.,31603,2
31603,Not sure.,31603,2
31603,It's small however noticeable because the back is solid cream.,31603,2
31604,The description for this bathing suit is false & is a huge disappointment.,31604,2
31604,"It clearly states under ""product description"" that this is an ""underwire"" & a ""push up"" yet it is neither.",31604,2
31604,"In fact, there is no wire at all... not sure who wrote the description & why they think the super thin foam is what makes a pushup but it couldn't be further from that.",31604,2
31604,"Also, I am 5ft 3in & 102 lbs yet the suit is too short (the top of the bathing suit barely goes above the nipple) & pulls down on your shoulders & neck.",31604,2
31604,"The straps fail to stay in place as well, every single time I move one of them comes unhooked.",31604,2
31604,The overall design is very beautiful though & I'll admit that customer service gave me a full refund asap but I would rather have a bathing suit that fits.,31604,2
31605,"It is tiny, needs to be paired with about 4 other necklaces to make any time of statement.",31605,2
31606,Fits about 2 sizes smaller than normal.,31606,2
31607,"Pretty outfit when I received it looked just like the picture but for a one size fits all dress, it runs very small.",31607,2
31607,Your tits have to be super small for this.,31607,2
31607,I could only fit in the skirt,31607,2
31608,"they ride pretty tight in the crotch and the seams are really bulky and intrusive, on the upside they do keep you're junk in place, but you can find better boxers that do that.",31608,2
31609,Mid weight.,31609,2
31609,Not for winter.,31609,2
31609,Poorly made/Cheap.,31609,2
31609,Interior of pocket ripped first time wearing.,31609,2
31610,Definitely $10 glasses.,31610,2
31610,Think gas station quality or less.,31610,2
31610,Were advertised as polarized lenses.,31610,2
31610,They are not.,31610,2
31611,Way too big.,31611,2
31612,Not even close to the dimensions stated.,31612,2
31612,"Measures closer to 4.5"" x 7.5"" x 1.5""",31612,2
31613,I didn't like the material.,31613,2
31613,Beside it had a torn area in the front of the dress.,31613,2
31613,Wasn't able to wear it.,31613,2
31614,It is a beautiful dress.,31614,2
31614,Got it for my mom who is a size 6.,31614,2
31614,Had to get her a size 14 because it runs so small.,31614,2
31615,These are very nice looking pants that completely fell apart the first day of wear.,31615,2
31615,"I bought them for my son, they fit snugly, but not tight.",31615,2
31615,"Within an hour as he was getting in the car, the crotch seam split, leaving a two inch hole.",31615,2
31615,"Then he while outside, he ran across the yard and they split to the knee and the button popped off.",31615,2
31615,Seriously disappointed.,31615,2
31615,"These were not cheap and although they are not truly tactical pants, I didn't  expect them to fall apart the first day.",31615,2
31616,"The color online looked very rich and warm, but when I received it, it was just a regular ole brown.",31616,2
31616,Disappointed to say the least.,31616,2
31617,sizes aren't accurate.,31617,2
31617,missing some/ have duplicates of the sme size.,31617,2
31618,"Looked OK, but it was way too small (I purchased the XXL and had to give it to my wife who usually wears a women's medium).",31618,2
31618,"If you like a skin tight sweater, then this is for you.",31618,2
31619,I was really hoping to love this jumpsuit.,31619,2
31619,"The fabric was great, however it was about 3 sizes too small, too sheer, and very short.",31619,2
31619,"I read the sizes before purchasing, however they didn't match up for me.",31619,2
31619,"I ended up returning as I'm 5'11, and this jumpsuit didn't even reach my ankles.",31619,2
31620,Scotty craftsmanship.,31620,2
31620,Wider than today's tie width.,31620,2
31620,Meh,31620,2
31621,Too small cheap quality,31621,2
31622,Adorable but starting to pill after 2nd day.,31622,2
31623,Too big and no structure.,31623,2
31624,I bought a set of these a few months ago and was pleased that they lasted 3 months.,31624,2
31624,I ordered 3 more and the first one has the lens overlapping the nose piece and places a sharp edge on my nose which makes them uncomfortable.,31624,2
31624,I haven't opened the other two yet and hope they are like the original pair that I bought.,31624,2
31625,Started off GREAT but quickly fell apart.,31625,2
31625,I barely got 3 months of daily wear from it.,31625,2
31625,The handles split from where they are sewn to the body of the bag.,31625,2
31625,"Quite a shame, because otherwise it is very roomy and perfect proportions.",31625,2
31625,I got lots of compliments while I could carry it.,31625,2
31625,"If I had to do over, I'd see if they could be reinforced from the beginning.",31625,2
31626,The pants seemed to be made decently.,31626,2
31626,I wear a 0 or 00 from the gap and banana republic.,31626,2
31626,The size 1 was really tight.,31626,2
31626,I got the zipped but they weren't flattering at all.,31626,2
31626,"Also, the color is more minty green than a Kelly green.",31626,2
31626,"Unfortunately, I returned this item.",31626,2
31627,Order 2 sizes up!!!,31627,2
31627,"I should have read the reviews first, but assumed the sizes were correct since when you click size chart, it clearly shows the correct sizes.",31627,2
31627,"I got these and couldn't zip the side up and thought to myself ""WOW I gained weight fast!"".",31627,2
31627,Then I read the label.,31627,2
31627,Make sure you order 2 sizes up!,31627,2
31627,I think these are UK sizes.,31627,2
31627,"They are nice other than that, it will just be a while before I can use them.",31627,2
31628,Shoe was suppose to be wide but it was very narrow.,31628,2
31628,I could not use them,31628,2
31629,Too short in the torso.,31629,2
31629,And fit's awkwardly.,31629,2
31629,It bulges out by the shoulder blades.,31629,2
31630,its a little small but not bad,31630,2
31631,Unfortunately the legs didn't fit and the buttons kept popping open.. even though I had ordered the next size up.,31631,2
31631,Had to return the outfit.,31631,2
31632,cute but way too big for my nose /:,31632,2
31633,"These are slightly smaller than the lenses they replaced, but still fit well enough that they stayed within the frames without trouble.",31633,2
31633,"However, these got scratched almost immediately.",31633,2
31633,(Within a day).,31633,2
31633,"We actually switched back to the original scratched lens because these replacement lenses were scratched so badly, with nothing more than a day's wear (not dropped, etc).",31633,2
31633,The original lenses lasted a year of routine wear before finally getting scratched.,31633,2
31633,"Not worth the price, unless your sunglasses just sit on a shelf and look pretty all the time.",31633,2
31634,Zip kept getting stuck in same place.,31634,2
31634,Does not work well for Apple Watch Sport bands,31634,2
31635,I ordered it for convenience of not going to a store.,31635,2
31635,I dnt think the quality of the briefs are good for the price that I paid.,31635,2
31635,I wouldn't recommend this item.,31635,2
31636,Such a cute suit.,31636,2
31636,"However, unless you are a size A top and have a thick booty it's not going to fit.",31636,2
31636,I ordered the XL and bottoms were too big and top way too small and I am not big chested.,31636,2
31636,I'm about a c- cup and weigh 145lbs and my booty is not flat.,31636,2
31636,Also the band to hook around chest is not adjustable and that was too big while cups were too small.,31636,2
31636,It's just over all a really weird fit.,31636,2
31637,This is ridiculously small!,31637,2
31637,The ONLY reason it got 2 stars is because of the super cute print.,31637,2
31637,I ordered a large and normally wear an large sometimes xl (depending on the brand) and it was way too tight.,31637,2
31637,It fits more like a womans small!,31637,2
31638,thin quality,31638,2
31639,All in all it's a cool case but I hate the fact that I put it to charge a few days after I got it and the input of the charger was loose and didn't charge the case anymore!,31639,2
31639,So that pretty much sucked!,31639,2
31639,But I guess you do get what you paid for.,31639,2
31640,"Too large, maybe I measured wrong.",31640,2
31640,Will exchange for next smaller size,31640,2
31641,"Advertised as long, needed for gym,was fairly short, had to return.",31641,2
31641,".pic shows long tank, was not.",31641,2
31642,This necklace is adorable.,31642,2
31642,I have it to my 7 year old daughter this weekend as a special gift from mom.,31642,2
31642,"Sadly, the chain has broken three times now.",31642,2
31642,The first two spots were fixable with some pliers.,31642,2
31642,The last one is not.,31642,2
31642,We will have to buy a new chain.,31642,2
31642,The actual trinket is adorable and seems durable.,31642,2
31643,"I tried it on once, decided to keep it.",31643,2
31643,I put it on for the second time two days before my event in order to style my hair and the loop that holds the headband fell apart.,31643,2
31643,"No time to return it for a new one, so I decided to sew it back together.",31643,2
31643,Then the felt backing started coming off.,31643,2
31643,glue didn't work so I had to stitch the backing to the fascinator netting.,31643,2
31643,What a mess.,31643,2
31643,I wore it to a wedding and received tons of compliments.,31643,2
31643,Not sure if I would buy from the same company again though,31643,2
31644,They were fine up until it got to my thighs and then it looked bad.,31644,2
31644,The lace doesn't show because it's so tight and trying to pull them just doesn't work past a certain point.,31644,2
31644,"By themselves, not so cute.",31644,2
31644,If you pair it with a garter belt - super hot,31644,2
31645,It doesn't fit my iPhone 6 ..,31645,2
31645,So I can't use it ..,31645,2
31645,Very upset because I was given the large bag as a gift for Christmas and was so happy to find this..,31645,2
31646,See through and bad quality!,31646,2
31646,I ended up giving t away.,31646,2
31647,It looks cheap and not as in the picture,31647,2
31648,It was cute but too small and doesn't stretch at all,31648,2
31649,Fit tight around neck and sleeve area.,31649,2
31650,See threw zero lining g,31650,2
31651,"Pearls were silvery grey, not white.",31651,2
31652,"Very large under the arms, but small across the chest.",31652,2
31652,Very long!,31652,2
31653,"I bought another ACEVOG cowl neck button tunic, and loved it so much that I bought this one.",31653,2
31653,"But the sleeves widen at the wrist, unlike the other one, and the cowl neck isn't as nice as pictured.",31653,2
31653,"I'm 5'4"", 148 lbs., and thought I'd try the large.",31653,2
31653,Fits fine around the waist--I wanted it loose--but the sleeves are messed up!,31653,2
31654,These do not work on my Invacare wheelchair.,31654,2
31654,I am back to my duct tape.,31654,2
31655,"This Tie Bar looks great, but the back doesn't reach far enough to not shift if you move when you wear it, as it doesn't clip to enough of the shirts",31655,2
31656,Way too small.,31656,2
31656,"Ordered an 11 for my 5 year old, but it was smaller than her current size 10s!",31656,2
31656,"Bummed because they were really cute, the problem is not knowing what size would fit.",31656,2
31657,The top actually fit my baby just fine but the pants fit my 3 year old nephew.,31657,2
31657,I can't imagine a child that the shirt and the pants would fit at the same time.,31657,2
31657,It is too bad because this is such an adorable set.,31657,2
31657,I gave it two stars because I love the shirt so much.,31657,2
31657,Maybe I can convince someone with a sewing machine to alter the pants.,31657,2
31658,It's quite big... it also feels hot when you wear it after awhile.,31658,2
31659,Highly disappointed because it wasn't the shape that I saw in the picture.,31659,2
31659,It is good that you get a lot for the price that its for but I wouldn't buy them,31659,2
31660,Very pretty but sizing is way off.,31660,2
31660,About three sizes off.,31660,2
31661,"Was not strung very well, although the pieces of quarts can be restrung, the bracelet broke the 2nd time my daughter wore it",31661,2
31662,Too small......:(,31662,2
31663,Loved the dress but it was to big and also way to long.,31663,2
31663,I had to have it altered to fit.,31663,2
31664,"Nice coat, but waaaaaaay too small.",31664,2
31664,Definitely not true-to-size.,31664,2
31664,"My daughter is a ""M"" and even the XL is too small.",31664,2
31665,it was so cute but the bust was way too small,31665,2
31666,Put together cheap.,31666,2
31666,Not worth anything  already fallen apart after 1 wearing,31666,2
31667,Blah.,31667,2
31667,I wanted to love these.,31667,2
31667,"They are simple, cheap and come already assembled.",31667,2
31667,Yay!,31667,2
31667,"Yay, until you realize that the bails you selected won't fit over the gargantuan coil crimping the clasp to the cord.",31667,2
31667,"Then, it is more like ""$&%@%%$$"" at which point you try to shove it through and the cheapo clasp and chain are way to easy to destroy.",31667,2
31667,"Even if my bails had been the right size, the clasp and chain are just not that well made.",31667,2
31667,Many necklaces arrived broken and impossible to repair.,31667,2
31667,Just remember that you get what you pay for.,31667,2
31668,Returned.,31668,2
31669,Doesn't fit at all like the picture.,31669,2
31669,Didn't even use it for my toddler boy cause way cheap looking pants and shirt looks like a girl's shirt.,31669,2
31670,"Doesn't look like photos, was too large",31670,2
31671,Returned product didn't like the fit,31671,2
31672,Dress was nice but too small in the chest.,31672,2
31673,Started to turn black after the first wear,31673,2
31674,Very large.,31674,2
31674,Very very large.,31674,2
31675,While plus sized this shirt was definitely juniors plus sized.,31675,2
31675,Way too small for me.,31675,2
31676,Pretty dress but the zipper does not zip easily up OR down.,31676,2
31676,Picture shows darker coffee color towards bottom but actual dress is all one color.,31676,2
31676,Front of dress from waist to floor is very see-thru.,31676,2
31677,Too small,31677,2
31678,Great jacket....,31678,2
31678,I ordered XL I usually wear a m/l and it's super tight very disappointed,31678,2
31679,Definitely a dull green color.,31679,2
31679,Very sage.,31679,2
31679,I was looking for a brighter green.,31679,2
31680,was damaged - returned it -- pretty though,31680,2
31681,Don't stay on as well as I'd hoped,31681,2
31682,It doesn't look that great in real.,31682,2
31683,Too big for a little hand.,31683,2
31684,Fit way too boxy and small for size..,31684,2
31685,It looks cool but can't keep time at all.,31685,2
31686,Looks fine but very thin material and the sizes run small.,31686,2
31686,"Ordered a XL but this fits more as a medium or a smaller large
  I just tried this brand for the first time but don't think I will again.",31686,2
31687,The buckles were cheap plastic,31687,2
31688,not very good,31688,2
31689,I am a 38B and these bras managed to both flatten my breasts and make them look wide set.,31689,2
31689,"Also, I did not find them more comfortable than my regular underwire bras.",31689,2
31689,But I could see how someone (with a smaller band size and who would trade flattering their breasts for a potentially more comfortable bra) might be happy with these.,31689,2
31689,I was looking for a sleep bra or a stretchy day bra and these just didn't work for me.,31689,2
31690,Was not what I was expecting,31690,2
31691,I love the dress.,31691,2
31691,"BUT .....it was delivered today, and when I took it out of the package, there was an orangeish red big stain on the left breast area....my wedding is too soon to return it.",31691,2
31691,Very unhappy with this situation.....,31691,2
31692,Not what i expected.,31692,2
31692,You get what you pay for.,31692,2
31692,Material is very thin...see through.,31692,2
31692,Haven't washed yet...almost scared that the lacy part will fall apart.,31692,2
31692,On the up side the shipping was fast.,31692,2
31693,"Advertised as made in USA, received made in Thailand.",31693,2
31693,The panties are always too small when they are made in Thailand.,31693,2
31693,"Two stars because the quality was okay even if I can't wear it, very colorful.",31693,2
31694,The material is very very cheap and not of good quality AT ALL,31694,2
31695,The random selection was pretty bad.,31695,2
31695,Most of the ones I got were weird patterns and very similar in color.,31695,2
31696,It's a really cute bracelet but it turns my wrist black,31696,2
31697,"Looks really cute, but the tassel part sheds like crazy, which makes a big mess",31697,2
31698,I ordered this dress because I planned on wearing it once and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a dress that I will only wear one time.,31698,2
31698,I am very disappointed in it for many reasons.,31698,2
31698,"First, the color is not blush as was advertised -- it is a brighter pink color.",31698,2
31698,"On top of that, this dress is very short compared to what is shown on the model.",31698,2
31698,"Also, the underslip for the dress is bunched up and is a lot shorter than the outer chiffon layer.",31698,2
31698,"The chiffon is see-through and you can see how much shorter the underslip is, poorly made.",31698,2
31698,I am definitely returning this dress and will not be buying another one of its type.,31698,2
31698,Don't bother with this dress unless you are short!,31698,2
31699,the item is correct to size but it looks cheaper that it appears in the model pic the material is cheap not worth the buy,31699,2
31700,They were torn at the bottom where the shorts and cheek go together,31700,2
31701,"These pins claim to be stainless and high quality, and a bargain for the meticulous individual.",31701,2
31701,Unfortunately after two months this box is going in the trash.,31701,2
31701,"These pins rust, and fast.",31701,2
31701,They also fail.,31701,2
31701,I've had two rather expensive watches fall off their bands because the rusting pins gave out.,31701,2
31701,Don't trust these pins.,31701,2
31702,I bought this to wear for the 4th of July.,31702,2
31702,"I didn't read very well, and it isn't clearly marked, that the shirt is BLACK/red/white, rather than BLUE/red/white.",31702,2
31702,I am not bothering to return it because it will cost more than it was worth.,31702,2
31702,I ended up just wearing it as a pajama shirt... the black is weird and definitely did not want to wear it for the 4th of July.,31702,2
31702,Oh well.,31702,2
31703,This was way out of proportion on me.,31703,2
31703,"I am 5'6"" and weight 224 & a 20 fits me perfectly in tops, jeans, jackets etc..",31703,2
31703,The jacket was too long.,31703,2
31703,"IF it had fit, I would not have kept it.",31703,2
31703,It is way over priced for the quality and workmanship.,31703,2
31703,"It arrived wrinkled in a plastic bag, folded in half and the lapels had been pressed incorrectly to the point the crease would never be right for the jacket to hang correctly in the front.",31703,2
31703,Was not impressed with the fabric either.,31703,2
31703,I think more like $25.00 should be the price for this item so it was returned at my expense.,31703,2
31703,I am waiting for a refund now.,31703,2
31704,not swimsuit material at all.,31704,2
31704,looks like it does in the picture tho.,31704,2
31704,Just not for swimming at all ever,31704,2
31705,It's not as pictured above.,31705,2
31705,The straps are much more sturdy and thick in the picture.,31705,2
31705,"The ones i received were very thin, like spaghetti straps, and my immediate thought when i unwrapped it was it looked like it was made for a child.",31705,2
31706,Good quality.,31706,2
31706,Too small.,31706,2
31706,Not worth the cost.,31706,2
31707,String is too small to really even wrap around more than once.,31707,2
31707,"Somewhat disappointing, but the price is cheap so it was expected.",31707,2
31708,Runs small,31708,2
31709,I ordered a size 3 for my daughter to wear for her school uniform.,31709,2
31709,They fit her fine and she says they are comfortable.,31709,2
31709,But these are skinny pants so I felt that with the wash and my daughter still growing she would grow out of them soon.,31709,2
31709,I decided to order her a size bigger to see if it would there wasn't that much difference in size.,31709,2
31709,The next size available was a size 5.,31709,2
31709,"I went ahead and ordered them because I thought, if they don't fit I can just return them.",31709,2
31709,I got a completely different product.,31709,2
31709,Not even the same brand as the one I ordered before.,31709,2
31709,It's no big deal because they were a good fit for my daughter and she liked them.,31709,2
31709,But I am disappointed that I got something different than what I ordered.,31709,2
31710,They are very poorly made.,31710,2
31710,I ordered 2 pairs and by the time they arrived the side lens had fallen out of both and I could not get them to stay in.,31710,2
31711,"Very cute hat, but way too small.",31711,2
31711,Sizing is for 1-3 year old and it doesn't fit at all on my 13 month old.,31711,2
31712,"The material is not irritating, but what is?",31712,2
31712,The way this garment fits.,31712,2
31712,The bottom is puffy in the crotch area like it was made for a man not a woman.,31712,2
31713,Material was much thinner than it appears in the picture .... also MUCH smaller than expected,31713,2
31714,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,31714,2
31715,Not nearly the amount of compression I was expecting.,31715,2
31715,Barely noticed any support whatsoever and for the price I expected much more from it.,31715,2
31715,Unfortunately it was a waste of $40 bucks!,31715,2
31715,!,31715,2
31716,did not fit,31716,2
31717,The swim shorts were missing but granddaughter wanted to wear it so she used other shorts under it.,31717,2
31717,I'm not a bit happy,31717,2
31718,Seems sturdy except for the opening lever.,31718,2
31718,"For the price that they are asking, it is not worth it.",31718,2
31719,These pajamas smelled oddly chemical-y and ran incredibly small.,31719,2
31719,"Order at least one size up, maybe two.",31719,2
31720,Way too small ....,31720,2
31721,"I could still wear it even though it is a tighter fit than I like, but the Vee is way too deep.",31721,2
31722,did not like them.,31722,2
31722,returned them,31722,2
31723,this dress/tunic was so cute but it didn't stand up to washing.,31723,2
31723,it got sticky (stuck to itself) and pilly after 1 or 2 washes.,31723,2
31723,i tossed it out today.,31723,2
31724,Wasn't the right material.,31724,2
31724,Was silk rather than a T-shirt.,31724,2
31725,Not so great fit.,31725,2
31726,NO!,31726,2
31726,This looks horrendous on me.,31726,2
31726,I am 5'5 and 130 pounds  This shirt shows every single ripple in my body.,31726,2
31726,With tightfitting outfits are usually wear spanks.,31726,2
31726,"Even with those, this thing looked absolutely awful.",31726,2
31726,It's must be something with the material.,31726,2
31726,I'm not an overWeight  woman.,31726,2
31726,I have a little belly but nothing crazy.,31726,2

31727,"They were too small for my normal earring,no recieipt or return Label",31727,2
31728,"They said runs small, but it was huge!",31728,2
31728,Money refunded.,31728,2
31729,I was not pleased.,31729,2
31729,I ordered a green skater dress and a black one in the same size and both tags told said they were a medium large but the black one is tight.,31729,2
31729,The green skater dress ripped the 1st time i wore it and that was the one that WAS the right size.,31729,2
31729,I am normally a satisfied customer but not with this order.,31729,2
31730,These shorts aren't lined so you can see completely through them.,31730,2
31730,Don't purchase them if your planning on wearing them as shorts.,31730,2
31730,They might work as a swim cover up.,31730,2
31731,"If you have a cheap watch, great get this.",31731,2
31731,"If not, go to a shop and get it done.",31731,2
31731,This thing is cheap,31731,2
31732,The material was very slick and made a weird noise when I walked.,31732,2
31732,It fit pretty snug for me and the heart wasn't solid It kept changing colors in spots that were touched and looked kind of tacky.,31732,2
31732,Cute design but maybe better for a child the adult.,31732,2
31733,Nice design but returned as they were just a bit to snug for my liking.,31733,2
31733,I have their exercise pants in a medium and they fit fine.,31733,2
31733,Also another pair of their shorts and they fit fine.,31733,2
31733,"These, not so great.",31733,2
31733,"I am 5'3"" 140 and muscular.",31733,2
31734,"I'm 5'10"" and they fit in the waist but not the length",31734,2

31735,"They weren't a true white, more off white.",31735,2
31736,Good looking sock but fit is terrible.,31736,2
31736,Had to pry them on and off for my sister's wedding.,31736,2
31737,"This suit is SUPER cute, but it is just too small for large breasted women (DD-DDD).",31737,2
31737,It is a big bummer because it is so cute.,31737,2
31737,It is cut way too small to fit anyone with larger than a B cut I feel.,31737,2
31738,This blouse looks more like pajamas on me.,31738,2
31738,Not what I thought this blouse would be.,31738,2
31738,Although I am not very tall about 5'1 so if someone tall ordered this it may look better on them.,31738,2
31739,The fabric on t his dress is awful.,31739,2
31739,I gave it 2 stars because of the price.,31739,2
31739,"It is nearly see through, and very shiny.",31739,2
31739,Looks as cheap as it is.,31739,2
31740,"I like how it looks, but opening to put your head through isn't large enough.",31740,2
31740,"I can't get the cover up over my head, and I have a relatively small head.",31740,2
31740,Perhaps the manufacturer should consider putting elasticity in it or somehow make the opening more flexible.,31740,2
31741,It just ok.,31741,2
31742,"First attempt to wear it the chain broke, was not even able to wear it.",31742,2
31742,"The elephant itself is kinda cute, but cheap material for a cheap price ;)",31742,2
31743,Bottoms are big and totally see through.,31743,2
31743,Very unflattering.,31743,2
31743,The top has cups but they float around too much and there's no stitching around the sides so it looks cheap.,31743,2
31744,Looks horrible on,31744,2
31745,I bought this item for my wife.,31745,2
31745,Size is good and looks excellent on my wife.,31745,2
31745,I am disappointed b/c the packaging states the stockings are optional?,31745,2
31745,"What the....if this accessory is ""optional"" that point should be evident before purchasing the product.",31745,2
31745,"The display clearly demonstrates the model with the top,  skirt, and STOCKINGS!",31745,2
31745,FALSE ADVERTISING,31745,2
31746,"Super cute, but the tassels/fringe keeps falling off.",31746,2
31747,It was a beautiful dress just a little too small,31747,2
31748,The fit of this dress was very awkward.,31748,2
31748,Does not fit like the picture.,31748,2
31749,I was gonna buy it because of its color but in the reality it's not as vibrant blue at all as on the picture :(,31749,2
31750,I loved the colors and stripes; also the v-neck.,31750,2
31750,The size is another thing.,31750,2
31750,I ordered a  large  where I would normally order a large.,31750,2
31750,The shirt is stretchy but it fit me like a medium so I gave it to my daughter who wears a medium and it fit her well.,31750,2
31750,I recommend buying this shirt 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear!,31750,2
31750,"Also, the shirt was shipped from China and it took several weeks to arrive.",31750,2
31751,Pretty beach dress.,31751,2
31751,Liked the material.,31751,2
31751,Just order a size or two up.,31751,2
31751,The seam on the arm ripped on first wear.,31751,2
31752,It was small  in the arm/ sleeve  and my wedding is 9/2/16 additional money i have to spend,31752,2
31753,"It's beautiful bur, the Japanese sizes are very confusing on line.",31753,2
31753,I can never were any of the 2x I order that are Japan sizes.,31753,2
31754,"Well, the picture looked purple with a black strap; the description says ""royal blue"".",31754,2
31754,The actual bag is navy blue with a brown strap.,31754,2
31754,Was going to keep it despite being disappointed until I noticed the strap is torn (or not completely sewn) on one side.,31754,2
31754,Will be returning this.,31754,2
31755,Nice shirt .,31755,2
31755,runs small.,31755,2
31756,Returned due to the very SHORT nature of the sweater.,31756,2
31756,It's like a crop top on steroids.,31756,2
31756,"I put it on and my boyfriend remarked I should save it for Halloween, didn't even cover my belly button.",31756,2
31756,"I'm very petite (5'2"") so that should tell you something.",31756,2
31756,I bought this for work so it was extremely inappropriate even with a tank top underneath.,31756,2
31756,"It was cute otherwise and seemingly good quality, so I gave it 2 stars.",31756,2
31757,"Top was awful, made for broad chests or far a art boobs",31757,2
31758,Cheap looking and too thin.,31758,2
31759,Not for large-breasted women.,31759,2
31759,The tie is also disassembled and the collar pops up constantly.,31759,2
31759,Too long.,31759,2
31760,Was not cotton but more of a silky material .,31760,2
31760,It looks more like a girls shirt,31760,2
31761,these need a zippered drop seat,31761,2
31762,Bought a large.,31762,2
31762,Couldn't get it over my head.,31762,2
31763,It was completely see through.,31763,2
31763,I returned the item because it was too reveling for me.,31763,2
31764,Disappointed in quality!!,31764,2
31764,!,31764,2
31765,"Too little capacity for me, so I returned.",31765,2
31766,Not what I expected.,31766,2
31766,It bubbles out in the waist and is tight in the arms.,31766,2
31766,Returning.,31766,2
31767,I was honestly hoping for better from these but sometimes you really get what you pay for.,31767,2
31767,Not only are the colors not as bright as they look on here.,31767,2
31767,Two different earrings broke just minutes after I opened them.,31767,2
31768,I am approximately 5ft 6in tall.,31768,2
31768,"210 pounds, 38DD bust.",31768,2
31768,"I typically wear a size 16 in pants and a size 14 in dress, after reading other reviews I ordered the biggest size 6x Whig I believe is a 18/20 in USA sizing.",31768,2
31768,When I tired it on it was incredibly small.,31768,2
31768,I had to adjust the ribbon on the back nearly all the way to get it to fit.,31768,2
31768,So there is about a 2 or 3 inch gap keeping it from closing fully.,31768,2
31768,"The front clasps were very hard to use, and I imagine would be even if the product had fit properly.",31768,2
31768,Runs very small.,31768,2
31768,Fast shipping.,31768,2
31768,Below average quality.,31768,2
31769,As expected for the cost.,31769,2
31769,But wears well with my little sweater.,31769,2
31770,"These look good, but wash them before wearing.",31770,2
31771,"Is more white, not as colorful as depicted.",31771,2
31772,Thin material.,31772,2
31772,Kind of small.,31772,2
31773,don't bother,31773,2
31774,Ball pouch is two small to cover,31774,2

31778,I went up a size but the belt and the top of the dress were way too small.,31778,2
31778,The color also was not a true purple,31778,2
31779,I ordered x large and got medium small instead.,31779,2
31779,I plan to return them and hopefully get the right size this time.,31779,2
31780,"Way huge, clunky",31780,2
31781,i didn`t like the material.,31781,2
31781,"electro-static, looks beautiful, feels bad.",31781,2
31782,"It is nice for the price, earrings are a little too heavy.",31782,2
31783,"Shirt was very square,, to big for me...",31783,2
31784,I ordered an XL and the size looks and fits like a Medium.,31784,2
31784,"If you have a larger chest, look for something else.",31784,2
31784,This shirt will just end up being too small.,31784,2
31785,Horrible.,31785,2
31785,Material is cheap.,31785,2
31786,Doesn't fit me,31786,2
31787,A lot bigger than I expected..,31787,2
31788,not worth it,31788,2
31789,"I loved it for a while, but then the color dulled and it looks more like copper now instead of rose gold.",31789,2
31790,"Pants were oddly sized, crotch was really low and thighs seemed really tight.",31790,2
31790,Top was a little large.,31790,2
31791,Last minute thing so I purchased.,31791,2
31791,Fits bigger than expected.,31791,2
31791,Material will make you sweat so much and its just foam.,31791,2
31792,Ordered this for my daughter who is a junior in high school.,31792,2
31792,"Started out okay with her load of books, laptop, etc but after about 3 weeks of school the zipper started separating every time she tried to zip it up.",31792,2
31792,"The zipper completely broke recently, unfortunately it's past my return period so we are stuck with it.",31792,2
31792,Not too impressed.,31792,2

31793,"However, when I received it, it was nothing like what I saw.",31793,2
31793,"Material is very thin and it ran small, about two sizes too small.",31793,2
31793,Would not recommend.,31793,2

31794,Too tight in boobs area.,31794,2
31795,Is two sizes too small.,31795,2
31795,Material very thin but colors are right,31795,2
31796,"I don't like it, but i didn't return because don't want to pay for shipping cost.",31796,2
31796,"However i do not recomment this maxi dress, Very thin material, can see though your underwear, bra... very tight a belly and very lose at the shoulder area, show area no need to be show !",31796,2
31796,i end up cut it short wear to sleep.,31796,2
31796,like a sleep wear !,31796,2
31796,!,31796,2
31796,!,31796,2
31797,It came in two parts and I had to figure out how to put it together and the part with the hearts kept sliding down which caused the bracelet to fit to snuggly.,31797,2
31798,"The print looked really cheap, not what I was expecting!",31798,2
31799,But is not white it is cream color,31799,2
31800,"Cute, but just too small in the bust.",31800,2
31801,"Product is good quality and colors are nice, but size is not correct.",31801,2
31801,I read reviews and order larger.,31801,2
31801,"I wear Large so I ordered in XXL, the size is actually a Small.",31801,2
31801,Don't even consider getting these if you wear a medium or larger.,31801,2
31801,I will have to return them and pay shipping fees.,31801,2
31802,"It doesn't seem like leather to me, certainly not of any quality.",31802,2
31802,It just seemed cheap.,31802,2
31802,"Of course, it was cheap.",31802,2
31802,You get what you pay for.,31802,2
31803,Returned it because one of the snaps did not work properly.,31803,2
31803,Will try again as I know this is a good product.,31803,2
31804,The ink faded/wore off after less than a week of use,31804,2
31805,"Was a gift, had to return because they are too large to be wearing them all the time for a guy.",31805,2
31805,Nice looking though.,31805,2
31805,Easy returns.,31805,2
31806,Quality of the bracelet isn't good.,31806,2
31806,The beads keep sliding down and the quality of the brown braid is horrible.,31806,2
31806,It isn't actually a braid but a plastic single piece rope.,31806,2
31806,Doesnt look as good as you would expect :(,31806,2
31807,It's not really slim fit.,31807,2
31807,"I'm 6'1"", 185 lb, not really slim, but I have a lot of extra room in this shirt.",31807,2
31807,"Not at all like the pictures, as others have stated.",31807,2
31807,It's just square cut shoulders to waist.,31807,2
31807,"Material is ok, light weight (I prefer heavier fabric).",31807,2
31808,Looks like a skirt,31808,2
31809,Even with ordering a size bigger it was still too small.,31809,2
31809,But other than the size problem everything else is awesome!,31809,2
31810,A little small for a XL,31810,2
31811,Not a good fit,31811,2
31812,Size was too large going by the description and it was VERY difficult to put on - way too many little hooks.,31812,2
31813,The diamonds fell out pretty fast.,31813,2
31814,"I didn't get to wear them for more than a couple days, and the threading had already started falling apart.",31814,2
31815,runs very small,31815,2
31816,"didn't like, fit not good, dealing with amazon and third party vendors leaves a lot to be desired",31816,2
31817,Cute but came apart right away,31817,2
31818,Two pairs of the socks had holes in them the first time I put them on.,31818,2
31819,Too small n too short.,31819,2
31820,Bad fit!,31820,2
31821,It would have been 5 star because it looked great until it was washed.,31821,2
31821,Now it looks like something a four year old would wear if you're going to buy it definitely only hand wash. Also extremely wrinkly after being washed so make sure you have an iron on hand,31821,2
31822,I liked it the dress but the bottom of the dress came unraveled so I only got to wear it once it's not naked very well,31822,2
31823,I know it's supposed to be oversized but wow!,31823,2
31823,"I think I'm kinda of a thick girl, I'm 5'4 180lbs I wear a 42DD in bra.",31823,2
31823,I bought an XL because that is the size shirt I normally wear and I am swimming in this shirt!,31823,2
31823,It literally goes down to my knees extremely baggy.,31823,2
31823,The sleeve goes about an inch past my finger tips.,31823,2
31823,I guess I'll be wearing it as a nightgown.,31823,2
31824,Not good quality but I guess okay for the price.,31824,2
31825,Super cheap.,31825,2
31825,Strings coming out all over so I am scared to wear it in case it splits.,31825,2
31826,VERY short.,31826,2
31826,More of a cover-up than a dress.,31826,2
31827,"I like the design but the material is very odd, the top has a huge elastic band that is uncomfortable and they are short.",31827,2
31827,They aren't comfortable like palazzo pants should be.,31827,2
31828,I did not realize that there was small sparkly stones on this top.,31828,2
31828,Not my style.,31828,2
31828,It also seems that it would be better suited as a maternity top.,31828,2
31829,"Although I like the black fabric under the brim and the shape is pleasing (unfortunate, though, that it's only one sizeit was too small for me), this is not that great of a hat.",31829,2
31829,"If you find a bunch of these in a store maybe it would be a better buy, because you'd be able to pick and choose to find one that's not all dried out and cracking, or folded and screwed up.",31829,2
31829,"The latter is a byproduct of Amazon's random shipping, but the former is definitely a quality issue with the hat itself.",31829,2
31830,"It didn't last too much after  it was broken, low quality.",31830,2
31831,I bought this for one time use for a photo shoot so i don't mind that I had to throw it away but if you're intending on using it more than once don't buy it.,31831,2
31831,The zipper broke the first time I unzipped it to try it on.,31831,2
31831,The teeth separated.,31831,2
31831,I thought I was able to fix it but then at the photo shoot it did it again and wardrobe had to sew me into the dress.,31831,2
31831,A lot of people are complaining about the size not being right but unless you're in denial or have no way of measuring yourself then the size chart will tell you what size you need.,31831,2
31831,It fit exactly the way it should according to the chart.,31831,2
31831,I'm a model and a size 4 so I know my measurements.,31831,2
31831,Just beware that the zipper is crap.,31831,2
31832,Its way to big but other than that it is  exactly like it is in the picture .,31832,2
31832,it is well made nice seems and everything it just cannot wear it because it is too short and big for me.,31832,2
31832,Wont be purchasing again..,31832,2
31833,I bought and extra large cuz I read some the reviews saying it ran small.,31833,2
31833,So not true.,31833,2
31833,What really annoyed me though was one of the straps in the back is twisted so it never lays flat.,31833,2
31834,Child sized....cheap looking,31834,2
31835,"I am a medium in america, got a 2x because it said in america, it was a large.",31835,2
31835,I wanted a large to wear it over other stuff.,31835,2
31835,"And yes, it is real tight, too tight.",31835,2
31836,Beautiful coat.,31836,2
31836,Not as advertised.,31836,2
31836,"Not at all waterproof, soaks right through.",31836,2
31836,Also large is way huge.,31836,2
31836,Normally I wear large but this is like XL,31836,2
31837,The yellow is transparent and the chest/shoulder area doesn't fit properly.,31837,2
31838,These are not cashmere!,31838,2
31839,The size is smaller than I expected,31839,2
31840,Very cheap however that is what I paid for.,31840,2
31840,My only concern is that the top bra part runs much small than the shorts and the tank top.,31840,2
31841,This is SO tiny!,31841,2
31841,My daughter is only 17 pounds and she is already too big for this.,31841,2
31842,Overpriced !,31842,2
31842,Beware that this just a band and not as good as in the pictures,31842,2
31843,Color was nice but it fit me funny so I returned it.,31843,2
31844,too tight,31844,2
31845,The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames that I don't like.,31845,2
31846,I went to Jamaica and climbed one of the water falls.,31846,2
31846,My toes would hit the stones and it was very painful.,31846,2
31846,The shoes had great grip.,31846,2
31846,I would use these shoes for water exercise.,31846,2
31847,Over priced at best these are a $12.99 pair of underwear..,31847,2
31848,"These look awesome but fit very, very small.",31848,2
31849,The pants fit perfect but are made of thin material.,31849,2
31849,They couldn't handle my busy work life.,31849,2
31849,Ripped after only seven wears.,31849,2
31850,blaa,31850,2
31851,Length of sleeves are fine but the length of the shirt is very short,31851,2
31852,Very strange fabric.,31852,2
31852,Not at all what I thought it would be.,31852,2
31852,Seems rather flimsy and thin.,31852,2
31852,"Purchased as a gift for my daughter, but I'm not sure I'm going to give it to her.",31852,2
31852,Overall disappointed.,31852,2
31852,Live and learn.,31852,2
31853,I didn't care for this top.,31853,2
31853,"The tank underneath runs a little small and it is polyester, and the ruffle on top is huge.",31853,2
31853,It just wasn't for me.,31853,2
31853,Kind of cheap looking.,31853,2
31854,Sad now my trip is ruined.,31854,2
31854,But that's life,31854,2
31855,I ordered the size that I needed going by their size chart.,31855,2
31855,When it arrived it was wayyyyyyy toooooooo small.,31855,2
31855,Looks like it was made for a child.,31855,2
31856,Fit very strangely.,31856,2
31857,Completely sheer!,31857,2
31857,Have to find something to wear underneath.,31857,2
31857,It is cute though.,31857,2
31858,"Vert thin, ripped after first wear",31858,2
31859,I liked the fit and shape of the bra but the zipper does not work properly and if you don't get it attached just right it comes undone.,31859,2
31859,Not a good thing if you are working out.,31859,2
31859,Am back to wearing my old sports bra.,31859,2
31860,Pretty shirt.,31860,2
31860,Looks much better in the photo and it's cheaply made.,31860,2
31861,It was pretty but it looked a little cheap personally.,31861,2
31861,Like it was made out of curtains.,31861,2
31861,It could look nice on some people I'm sure but not on me,31861,2
31862,It's not as cute as it appears to be in the picture and the collar is weird.,31862,2
31862,Wouldn't buy it again.,31862,2
31863,I was very disappointed that this ran so small.,31863,2
31863,One review I read said it runs small so I ordered a size larger than I would have.,31863,2
31863,Let me note that the cover up runs REALLY SMALL.,31863,2
31864,"Shouldn't be called a wallet, couldn't even fit it in my pants pocket lol",31864,2
31865,Arrived with a small hole in the shirt near the left front chest pocket.,31865,2
31865,Bummer.,31865,2
31866,This hat was apparently not available after iplaced my order so I settled with a different one.,31866,2
31866,They however were what was expected.,31866,2
31867,size ran to big.,31867,2
31867,Good quality I gave it away.,31867,2
31868,Way too small for a large size!,31868,2
31869,It doesn't look the same as the picture.,31869,2
31870,cute but runs very small.,31870,2
31871,To small,31871,2
31872,This shirt was extremely small and not exactly what I had in mind.,31872,2
31872,Very short !,31872,2
31873,Paid extra for quicker delivery arrived 2 days later the expected.,31873,2
31873,Item was was as described  but wasn't happy with it didn't seem to work very well maybe needed something more like thick leather or like material which I believe this seller has also.,31873,2
31873,Material to hard so things seem to shift in bag on the haRd surface.,31873,2
31874,It did not meet my expectations at all because of the magnetic closure of the bracelet it falls off very easily I lost it twice but thankfully I found it but I don't wear it all because of that.,31874,2
31874,It's a shame because the bracelet design is very nice.,31874,2
31874,What a shame.,31874,2
31875,threading started falling apart after first wash,31875,2
31876,Tight around the leg area .front some what snug,31876,2
31877,"Great shipping and packaging, but unfortunately the product is teeny, tiny.",31877,2
31877,My 14 yr old size 6 can't fit in them.,31877,2
31877,:(,31877,2
31878,The material is not as I expected.,31878,2
31878,"it is synthetic and shiny, I am returning this",31878,2
31879,The fabric is very cheap and thin...basically see through.,31879,2
31879,You get what you pay for.,31879,2
31880,"Nice fit, but the first time I washed it--by the instructions--the plastic piece holding the strap on broke and some of the elastic stitching in the waist came unraveled.",31880,2
31881,"What they don't show is the cheezy round plastic """"ZYSUN"" logo patch on the front of the bag, just below the short horizontal zipper.",31881,2
31881,"It's bigger around than a golf ball, so not inconspicuous.",31881,2
31881,I really don't like company logos on my stuff.,31881,2
31881,"Also the zipper was broken, fixed itself when I used it.",31881,2
31881,"And the beige color looks grey in the picture, I thought I was ordering a grey bag, my fault I didn't read the color when ordering.",31881,2
31881,And it does come in a very tiny box so is really extremely wrinkled when removed.,31881,2
31881,Not sure how to take care of that.,31881,2
31881,Don't know if I will keep this yet....seems functional but that logo thing really bugs me.,31881,2
31881,SHOW WHAT YOU ARE SELLING TRUTHFULLY!!!,31881,2
31881,"Also the shoulder strap is cloth, not nylon as pictured.",31881,2
31882,Short through the torso.,31882,2
31882,"I'm only 5'4"", but it wasn't long enough for me.",31882,2
31883,too freaking big and heavy,31883,2
31884,Way too small.,31884,2
31884,"I got an XL, and I typically wear a large.",31884,2
31884,Also it is more of a sweater than a blazer.,31884,2
31885,"Zippers didn't stand up during a 5 day trip to the Bahamas, problem was solved with a pair of pliers when I got home.",31885,2
31885,The cubes held a lot of clothes and the soft sides made them easy to maneuver,31885,2
31886,The brim is way too small.,31886,2
31886,Doesn't keep the sun off your ears and it looks strange when wearing it.,31886,2
31886,The photo does not do it justice,31886,2
31887,Such a beautiful necklace for the price.,31887,2
31887,i got so many compliments on this necklace and earing when i wore it to a wedding.,31887,2
31887,I was happy with this purchase and gave it 5 stars but item ended up breaking in pieces so i lowered my ratings,31887,2
31888,they catch on collars and scarfs and easily come off.,31888,2
31888,I went by the measurements but they run big.,31888,2
31888,Wouldn't purchase again.,31888,2
31889,Toddler size.,31889,2
31889,It did arrive on time,31889,2
31890,Nice top and material but not true to size.,31890,2
31890,I ordered 2x and it fit a medium.,31890,2
31891,wrong size,31891,2
31892,In the first week the clasp broke twice.,31892,2
31893,My only issue is that the color I thought I was getting is actualy a very different colorfrom above.,31893,2
31893,"More like fushia vs a plum, or purple!!!!",31893,2
31893,!,31893,2
31894,"The saying is cute, the material not too bad but the printing on the shirt was stuck to itself so when unfolded there were missing spots on the letters.",31894,2
31894,Very cheap so only good for  gag gift.,31894,2
31895,"I may have started with unrealistic expectations, but I was disappointed with this product.",31895,2
31895,"The band rolled up several times, and would ""ride up"" during the day.",31895,2
31895,"While it wasn't terribly hard to keep in place, I found I definitely couldn't put it on and forget it was there.",31895,2
31895,"I have a narrow waist and average width hips, so my body type might be part of the issue- camis tend to want to settle at my natural waist as well.",31895,2
31895,This band was useful for the 1-2 weeks while I was waiting for my maternity pants to arrive (around week 19 of my pregnancy).,31895,2
31895,My suggestion would be to just invest in 2-3 pairs of maternity pants.,31895,2
31895,I felt much more comfortable (mentally and physically) once I made the switch.,31895,2
31895,"Your will likely need them eventually, so you might as well buy early and get some good use out them.",31895,2
31896,Extremely small I wear size 18-20 I bought a 3x and it ripped with me putting it on that is how small it was.,31896,2
31897,This XXL was not even close to fitting I would say it's 50% smaller than an average large.,31897,2
31897,And women - don't try to fit it around you unless you're flat chested.,31897,2
31897,Yes less than $5 .,31897,2
31897,Should work to keep me covered from the sun...,31897,2
31898,Fits too small.,31898,2
31899,Much thinner than I expected.,31899,2
31900,There's not enough threads on the back of the earring to keep the ball tightly secured.,31900,2
31900,Lost one the first day I wore it.,31900,2
31901,I didn't expect the size,31901,2
31902,not for girls with thick legs,31902,2
31903,It was broken when I received it,31903,2
31904,Too small but didn't return.,31904,2
31904,Gave to a friend.,31904,2
31905,"I like it, but the chain broke during the first time I wore it.",31905,2
31905,I have not yet fixed it.,31905,2
31906,Ring is pretty but the black finish was already halfway worn off by the time it arrived.,31906,2
31907,"Cheaply made, the black that you see on the strap is painted on.",31907,2
31907,Poor craftsmanship.,31907,2
31907,Looks much better online- returned.,31907,2
31907,Not worth the cost - I might have kept it if it were a less expensive piece.,31907,2
31908,Should be in the petite section.,31908,2
31908,I expected it to run small which is why I ordered the largest size but I did not expect it to fall as short as it did.,31908,2
31908,"If you are a petite sized woman however, you will love this.",31908,2
31909,Dress is ok but the hand design is not good.,31909,2
31910,"Quality ok runs very small
Tried to return no response from seller",31910,2
31911,"Great concept, but didn't work for my 11 year old's shoes.",31911,2
31911,He ended up removing them partway through the day as they kept coming undone.,31911,2
31912,The umbrella got a hole after a few months of use.,31912,2
31912,Plastic is very fragile.,31912,2
31913,This is a pretty dress  but if you have any boobs at all it's probably not for you.,31913,2
31913,NO support at all!,31913,2
31914,Very little padding.,31914,2
31914,Very firm.,31914,2
31914,"A lot of arch support, but will hurt your feet if you have a flat foot.",31914,2
31914,Quality is not good.,31914,2
31914,Loosing upper fabric layer at some places after a few times of wear.,31914,2
31915,I had gotten the impression that it was a little heavier and that the bottom was looser.,31915,2
31916,Way too small and the company has not responded to my request for a refund in two weeks .,31916,2
31916,"Leather smell is so strong it fills up the room, maybe it is sprayed with leather scent.",31916,2
31917,Great material but SUPER TIGHT!!,31917,2
31917,I even ordered a size bigger,31917,2
31918,I ordered the wrong size.. Lol,31918,2
31919,"This dress was made nicely and very sturdy (felt like armor from all the wiring) but the neckline was much too high,went up my throat!",31919,2
31919,Very uncomfortable material and much too tight.,31919,2
31919,Was also much longer than I needed (I'm 5'4) rock color though.,31919,2
31919,The bottom part was nice also,31919,2
31920,not as pictured-  was not in box it only had a piece of foam,31920,2
31921,The lenses on these sunglasses are not blue!,31921,2
31922,These retainers are not all 18G.,31922,2
31922,Some were extremely thin (I am assuming they are 20G) but they are certainly not all 18G clear nose studs.,31922,2
31923,I'm 5'5 110 lbs 34D and the L didn't fit me.,31923,2
31923,But it's cute.,31923,2
31924,"Very nice watch for the price but, sadly, I must have received a defective one.",31924,2
31924,I replaced the battery and it still didn't work.,31924,2
31925,Okay,31925,2
31926,I wish this dress had worked for me.,31926,2
31926,the material is fabulous!,31926,2
31926,But the ratio of the chest to the waist is all off.,31926,2
31926,"The waist is too small and because of that, it doesn't fit right at all.",31926,2
31926,Very dissapointing,31926,2
31927,Beautiful dress with intricate designs just not made to actually fit.,31927,2
31927,The dress itself was too big (ordered a small) while it was entirely too short.,31927,2
31928,I had to wash this shirt 3 times after I received it due to a very strong chemical smell.,31928,2
31929,The red on the shirt was a compleatly different shade of red it was way more dark and more like a brown-red rather then red and the logo COMPLEATLY peeled off little by little over a few weeks.,31929,2
31929,It is now gone and i guess all i paid for is an expensive plain black tank top.,31929,2
31929,Ive posted two pictures one of the whole shirt now (sorry i don't have one of when i first got it) and one of whats left of the logo.,31929,2
31929,I even hand washed it to try to preserve the logo but it just rubbed off so easy even when wearing it  there was no stopping it.,31929,2
31930,Too short and small.,31930,2
31930,I am 5ft 9 and size 8-10.,31930,2
31931,Two sizes too small.,31931,2
31931,By at least one size larger than normal.,31931,2
31931,"Still, I think I am getting past crush 'm undies.",31931,2
31931,I like the 2 pouch system better.,31931,2
31932,Returned them.,31932,2
31932,They are not the thick ones that I was expecting.,31932,2
31932,I have to others like this before that were much thicker.,31932,2
31933,"cheap material, cheap printing...",31933,2
31934,too small and uncomfortable cheap fabric,31934,2
31935,"cute but waaaayyyy too small in the chest, even when I ordered the recommended size.",31935,2
31935,Do not order if you have any boobs at all.,31935,2
31936,Not as it appears,31936,2
31937,"I purchased a medium, It runs small.",31937,2
31938,They're all right.,31938,2
31938,"The see are regular ol' socks, but they're not bad, and hold elasticity well!",31938,2
31939,I didn't fit at all really.,31939,2
31940,Not worth it,31940,2
31941,They don't stay on very well.,31941,2
31941,"I was hoping they would work, but the slightest brush against a counter or piece of clothing, and the rubberband slips off the cuff.",31941,2
31941,Wish it worked!,31941,2
31942,"Only complaint is that it only lasted a very short time, about 3 weeks before it started to fall apart.",31942,2
31943,I honestly was pretty disappointed in these pants when they arrived.,31943,2
31943,"They aren't the worst ever, so I didn't bother going through the process of returning them.",31943,2
31943,I just thought they would be better because of all the 4 and 5 star reviews.,31943,2
31943,The first thing I have a problem with is the color.,31943,2
31943,"It looks like a pretty, light blue color in the picture, but in reality it is more like the bright turquoise.",31943,2
31943,I noticed at my school that some of the health care students had uniforms the exact same color.,31943,2
31943,"It just isn't a cute color, especially for workout pants.",31943,2
31943,"The second thing is the mesh part of the pants is really loose, so the fit is weird, and it also looks strange on my crotch the way it folds over.",31943,2
31943,"They aren't horrible, so I will be wearing them to work out in, but I was planning to be able to wear them around too, and I am pretty disappointed that they were not as cute as I expected.",31943,2
31944,Not as the product looks in the picture- at all.,31944,2
31944,Its more like a baret and does not lay flat like it does in the photo.,31944,2
31944,Just an okay product I'll never wear and I regret buying.,31944,2
31945,I wouldn't recommend buying this dress if you are short/petite.,31945,2
31945,"I am 5'3"" with a smaller frame and the dress went well below my knees and looked ridiculous on me.",31945,2
31945,It also bunched up around the middle because I have a shorter torso.,31945,2
31945,"In addition, when I received the dress, there was some loose threading, but hopefully my case was an isolated one.",31945,2
31945,"The top part of the dress is a bit sheer, but would probably be okay with a nude-colored bra.",31945,2
31945,Would probably look really good on a taller frame!,31945,2
31946,Cups took on a crazy irreversible shape after the first wash (on delicate) and the top sags down bad when wet.,31946,2
31946,Just not flattering.,31946,2
31946,There are better swim dresses out there,31946,2
31947,Extremely difficult to program,31947,2
31948,"The swimsuit is very cute but, the skirt is fitted & not flowing the way the pic shows",31948,2
31949,"First let me start by saying the locket is very well made, which is why I'm so mad that the chain it came on is crap.",31949,2
31949,"Because the chain is crap, my daughter no longer has the locket.",31949,2
31949,"She only has a broken chain, because we could figure out where she was at when the chain broke.",31949,2
31949,I bought 3 other lockets from another company.,31949,2
31949,"They were made the very same way, they just didn't have the pattern she wanted.",31949,2
31949,I paid $2 more for the other 3 and the chains are of greater quality.,31949,2
31949,"If you have a good chain to put it on, then this one is a great buy.",31949,2
31949,"But I no longer have that option, because the locket is lost.",31949,2
31949,"The quality of the locket earned the 2 stars, because to be fair it was well made.",31949,2
31950,They don't look at all like the picture.,31950,2
31950,Very much larger than I expected.,31950,2
31950,Disappointed.,31950,2
31951,"way too short for dress, more like shirt.",31951,2
31952,"Tights waistband fits fine, but the spider pattern does not stretch enough...",31952,2
31953,"The sweatshirt is really cute, it's a nice color too.",31953,2
31953,"However, it runs small.",31953,2
31953,And it will shrink in the wash.,31953,2
31954,"For an xtra large, this would have fit a twelve year old.",31954,2
31954,Very short with extremely tight but long sleeves.,31954,2
31954,"The colors were great and the fabric was super soft and cozy, but definitely not large enough for most women.",31954,2
31954,"Am not returning, passed it on to a granddaughter.",31954,2
31955,chest part was too small,31955,2
31956,"Looked cute, but the wife said it was too small and donated it to Goodwill.",31956,2
31956,"I wish I could have seen the look on the face of the employee that went to hang it, and the person that eventually bought it.",31956,2
31957,After reading the reviews I ordered this item a size larger to accommodate for the smaller size.,31957,2
31957,Unfortunately this made the top fit perfectly and the bottoms ballooned out from his body.,31957,2
31957,So we opted to return the outfit.,31957,2
31958,This product says cotton slim fit but the material has more of a spandex fit/feel than a cotton fit/feel.,31958,2
31958,Not really what I was expecting.,31958,2
31958,You have to pay to return item.,31958,2
31959,"Cute sweater, however fits nothing like it's shown in the pic.",31959,2
31959,The sweater is short and boxy.,31959,2
31959,Barely comes to the top of jeans or waistband.,31959,2
31960,To big for me the guie Size is not correctly,31960,2
31961,"Doesn't come with the top like photos, should mention it clearly",31961,2
31962,Material not to my liking,31962,2
31963,"Cute but geezzzz, once you finally get over your hips (and I'm a smaller hip/booty frame) it's cute.",31963,2
31964,Not fully sewn.,31964,2
31964,Froofy armpits.,31964,2
31964,"Not made for a human, more like something stamped out of a machine.",31964,2
31964,I recommend you buy a regular tank top instead.,31964,2
31965,I followed the size chart.,31965,2
31965,"I'm a 14 and got a xl but it fit like a medium, no bigger size available.",31965,2
31965,"Cute coat, took awhile to get to me.",31965,2
31965,I liked that the fur was removable.,31965,2
31966,The necklace metal irritates my skin and the actual piece looks cheap,31966,2
31967,Doesn't look like the picture.,31967,2
31968,My husband has several shirts similar to these in the same size.,31968,2
31968,These are an extra large and fit like a medium,31968,2
31969,I liked it but it was too small,31969,2
31970,Right foot was a whole size bigger.,31970,2
31971,Ran small,31971,2
31972,"Nice blouse but the Crowley neck is a little more revealing than I would have liked, but with a tank top under its ok.",31972,2
31973,This product is definitely too small.,31973,2
31973,"I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it at least fit around my waist comfortably (~42"").",31973,2
31973,"However, the pouch is WAY too small.",31973,2
31973,That's not a brag.,31973,2
31973,It's definitely smaller that it appears in the product photo.,31973,2
31973,Took my own photos (don't worry...,31973,2
31973,They're of the product on my hand and a PS4 controller for a sense of size).,31973,2
31973,Without getting too graphic or detailed...,31973,2
31973,"There's enough room for the twig or the berries, but not both.",31973,2
31973,"Let's just say... Until I got this product, I didn't know guys could get cameltoe.",31973,2
31973,"Now, I know.",31973,2
31973,"Also, it took almost a month to ship.",31973,2
31973,Can't figure out why.,31973,2
31974,Awkward and ugly material that seems more appropriate for table cloths or curtains.,31974,2
31975,Too small will give to my daughter,31975,2
31976,The top was too small and oddly shaped like cones.,31976,2
31976,"If you're bigger than a c cup, it isn't a good choice.",31976,2
31976,Bottom was snug too.,31976,2
31976,"All my other swimwear is XL or 14/16, so I ordered a 5x and felt like a whale.",31976,2
31976,:(,31976,2
31977,"Everything fit, but after one day of wearing them, a light on each shoe has a glitch and is a different color from what its set on.",31977,2
31977,It blinks different colors and doesnt match the rest of the shoe.,31977,2
31977,"The first day, it didn't do that.",31977,2
31977,this happened with both pairs i ordered!,31977,2
31978,"The color I ordered was coffee, but the belt I received was tan (even the tag said tan).",31978,2
31979,This bracelet broke almost immediately after putting it on.,31979,2
31979,Not durable elastic what so ever.,31979,2
31979,I had to go out to buy new wire in order to put the beads to use.,31979,2
31980,The sleeves are ridiculously narrow.,31980,2
31980,If you order one you need to go up two sizes.,31980,2
31980,Their large fits like small.,31980,2
31981,The loose knit fabric cuts into the bottom of the foot.,31981,2
31981,could use a tighter knit in the foot to avoid this.,31981,2
31982,Do not buy this set if you are starting from a standard size piercing.,31982,2
31982,I didn't realize that the smallest size is 12 G when buying this.,31982,2
31982,I see now that it states it.,31982,2
31982,"However, this is 2 sizes larger than a standard size earring and someone who is stretching their ears for the first time may not understand that you would be skipping 2 sizes.",31982,2
31982,I now have to try to find a 16 G and 14 g tapper and plugs so I can start.,31982,2
31982,The quality is low but that is to be expected for this price.,31982,2
31982,It will get the job done and you can invest in higher quality plugs after you are done stretching.,31982,2
31983,Ok...,31983,2
31983,I realise a few people have said this coat is too small... so the product description says check the size chart to the side to make sure it fits... so I did... and its still too small.,31983,2
31983,"I'm a small guy, so I checked the small size... 122 chest 72 length 50 shoulder 61 sleeve measured myself up, should be a pretty good fit.",31983,2
31983,Got the coat... its pretty much 4cm shorter than that on every measurement.,31983,2
31983,Which brings me too my second point...,31983,2
31983,It may be because its not the coat advertised.,31983,2
31983,The coat that arrived is actually a Columbia jacket... and has large yellow columbia logos on it.,31983,2
31983,Had I wanted a Columbia...,31983,2
31983,I would have ordered a Columbia.,31983,2
31983,I specifically chose this as it had no logos on it...,31983,2
31983,"So, why do I give it two stars instead of 1... the coat is actually quite nice and pretty good quality... its just not the coat I ordered or the size it says...",31983,2
31983,So I would suggest go two sizes over what you need.,31983,2
31983,"Which is what someone else mentioned in their review, and expect to get a different jacket (I saw somewhere else, someone got a Jack Wolf coat)",31983,2
31984,"MORE LIKE A SHIRT, INSTEAD OF  DRESS!",31984,2
31985,Looks great on model.,31985,2
31985,"Not a stretch jacket , so have to buy 2 sizes larger than other Koi jackets.",31985,2
31985,Non flexible makes it less comfortable.,31985,2
31985,This one goes back.,31985,2
31986,colors look faded,31986,2
31987,Couldn't even manage to kip it up.,31987,2
31987,Lace does not stretch one bit so unless you're tiny it won't even go all the way up my arms:( .,31987,2
31987,Really liked the idea and even planned to use it as a bday romper but now it's just in the closet with no use,31987,2
31988,Its stains..a lot.,31988,2
31988,"Stained my skin, had to give it a serious scrub and still evident that something was there.",31988,2
31989,"Ordered 2 sizes bigger & it s still way to small, can't wear at all.",31989,2
31989,"Plus it looks nothing like pic, material is very sheer & cheap!!",31989,2
31989,Not happy at all with this purchase.,31989,2
31990,The fabric is really light but I guess that's what I get for paying so low for clothing,31990,2
31991,Wasn't the same thing as in the picture it was a slightly different style and it was ted also fit big,31991,2
31992,Material was not what I expected.,31992,2
31992,Fits a little tight at shoulders.,31992,2
31993,"Pretty, but broke after one use.",31993,2
31994,"I love the jacket, but when I washed it (Not dried) the hood changed.",31994,2
31994,It's not the jacket I first loved .,31994,2
31994,"I think because I put it on top of the dryer, the hear affected it.",31994,2
31995,Shirt in picture was not shirt sent to me.,31995,2
31995,Fits great but not what I was expecting.,31995,2
31996,Way small and not made very well,31996,2
31997,Way too small for my nose.,31997,2
31997,Maybe better for your ear or something.,31997,2
31998,"I order the white one, and it's a cheap thin see through cotton material.",31998,2
31998,"And the ""white"" looks more like a light grey.",31998,2
31998,Maybe the black one looks better.,31998,2
31999,Fits well but the material is very thin,31999,2
32000,I love the different colors and how small they are.,32000,2
32000,My one complaint is the backs that come with them.,32000,2
32000,They are plastic and very cheap.,32000,2
32000,"They are constantly falling off, I ended up just using backs from other earrings when I wear these.",32000,2
32001,"Love these, but both screws on one side fell out.",32001,2
32001,Returning.,32001,2
32002,Runs really small and took several weeks to arrive.,32002,2
32003,It's not what's advertised.,32003,2
32003,It looks like a sweater type in the pictures.,32003,2
32003,"In actuality, it's a cotton material.",32003,2
32003,"Still pretty, and my daughter still liked it.",32003,2
32004,I am a woman who wears a size 9 and these socks are very small on me.,32004,2
32004,I love the designs though.,32004,2
32004,They are as clear as in the photos.,32004,2
32004,I was concerned that they wouldn't look as much like the pieces of art they are depicting but they stand up!,32004,2
32005,"Super cheap, fast shipping.",32005,2
32005,Only giving two stars because of price and quick shipping.,32005,2
32005,The suit itself was a disaster.,32005,2
32005,I got the extra large and it looked TINY.,32005,2
32005,I normally wear a size 10/medium and I didn't even try on the bathing suit.,32005,2
32005,Just by looking at it I could tell it would be too small.,32005,2
32005,"Plus, the top has NO support at all.",32005,2
32005,"Busty girls like me need support and the bra looked like it would barely be large enough for someone with a b cup, definitely too small for me (I wear a D).",32005,2
32006,"My girlfriend is 5' 10'"" tall.",32006,2
32006,These are way too short for her.,32006,2
32006,They do not come above her knees.,32006,2
32007,Would have been higher rated had they not arrived broken.,32007,2
32007,Opal looks more round and puffy in person.,32007,2
32008,"Not the best... Dont have big breasts , it doesnt support them",32008,2
32009,Drawing started to disappear after second day use.,32009,2
32010,Smaller then expected.,32010,2
32010,..No flow,32010,2
32011,I sent this directly back.,32011,2
32011,I have a pretty large chest but small hips.,32011,2
32011,I usually order Large but was hesitant due to reviews so I went to an XL.,32011,2
32011,I could not even begin to get it on.,32011,2
32011,It's only made for small framed women with NO curves and the material does NOT budge.,32011,2
32012,"THE DOG CHARM FEEL OFF IN LESS THAN A MONTH, POORLY MADE.SAVE YOUR MONEY",32012,2
32013,too small,32013,2
32014,"Not thigh high, just below my knee",32014,2
32015,"I tried, did not work for me.",32015,2
32015,After trying these in several different shoes.,32015,2
32016,"The dress came in quickly, about a week and a half for N.C.",32016,2
32016,I ordered the dress one size larger than what I usually am (XL) and it fits fine.,32016,2
32016,I'm 5'4' and 150 lbs.,32016,2
32016,"The lace looks nothing like the picture and is very long, but can be fixed by cutting the end.",32016,2
32016,The belt isn't very wide and not too long.,32016,2
32016,"The dye did come out when I first got it, but then I soaked it in vinegar, salt, and water, then washed it.",32016,2
32016,"The color doesn't bleed as much, but still does.",32016,2
32016,"It doesn't flare either, it's very flat.",32016,2
32016,"If you're looking for the dress to be just like the picture, don't buy it.",32016,2
32017,The case I received did not fit my phone.,32017,2
32018,These pants are not designed for a woman with hips or a booty.,32018,2
32018,The fabric also feels cheap and scratchy.,32018,2
32019,"One time wear, the skirt has piping that is coming out of the seams on every later and the top shrunk when washed.",32019,2
32019,Poor quality and a one use wear.,32019,2
32020,Feeling short-changed.,32020,2
32020,Purchased in April and within 3 months the shiny red finish cracked and chipped.,32020,2
32020,Threw it away in December.,32020,2
32021,I couldn't even use this because the hat would fit an adult but the gloves would only fit a small child.,32021,2
32021,I wasted my money.,32021,2
32021,I can not recommend this product.,32021,2
32022,My 14 y/o son ordered this.,32022,2
32022,He said it is very thin and feels different than his other North Face sweaters and hoodies.,32022,2
32023,I returned this because it was way too big and didn't look very much like the photo.,32023,2
32024,"The shirt LOOKS nice, but the sizing is extremely ""off.""",32024,2
32024,"My husband generally wears a large, but ordered an extra-large to have a looser fit for ease of movement while bowling.",32024,2
32024,"The torso fits like a large, while the arms and shoulders fit like a snug medium.",32024,2
32024,There's just no way to work around the cut of this shirt.,32024,2
32024,"If you order a size to fit the shoulders/arms, the torso will look ridiculously large.",32024,2
32024,VERY DISAPPOINTING.,32024,2
32025,Material and color looks great.,32025,2
32025,But the clip came off after three days.,32025,2
32025,I won't buy it again.,32025,2
32026,it fits too big and it doesnt look like the photo.,32026,2
32026,Plus it frazzles too much,32026,2
32027,Runs very small and cut up sides are very rough and stiff looking it hurts as they rub on skin.,32027,2
32027,Fits vey short on torso and small on  butt.,32027,2
32028,The quality of the product is as I expected for the price I paid.,32028,2
32028,"The robe was an okay fit, more so due to my changing size, but the gown was way too small.",32028,2
32028,"As it came as a set, I would expect that both items would fit the same, but did not.",32028,2
32028,"As the price was so reasonable, I did not return it, but donated it to others that could use the set separately.",32028,2
32029,Sizes are bigger,32029,2
32030,i returned too small but cute,32030,2
32031,Too Small.,32031,2
32031,If ordering add one size up.,32031,2
32032,It's huge!,32032,2
32032,Looks like a dress.,32032,2
32032,"I wear a 12-14, ordered a large.",32032,2
32032,Should have ordered a medium,32032,2
32033,there is a tight band right in the middle of the lacy area.. it barely goes over my knees.. not what i expected.. can't even wear them,32033,2
32034,Would have fit better maybe if I had a larger chest.,32034,2
32034,Otherwise very loose.,32034,2
32035,I bought for 4th of July.,32035,2
32035,It isn't red white and blue like it looks in pic.,32035,2
32035,It is black not blue.,32035,2
32035,Somewhat dissappointed,32035,2
32036,Ran really small for xlg.,32036,2
32036,Disappointed.,32036,2
32037,These seemed good in theory but they don't stick at all to some if the shoes I tried to put them on.,32037,2
32037,"Also because if the texture on the bottom every bit of grime, hair and dirt stick.",32037,2
32037,It made the bottoms if the shoes disgusting after only a few hours wearing the shoes.,32037,2
32038,I'm returning this shirt.,32038,2
32038,It's cute but in the picture is loose and long enough to wear with a pair of leggings.,32038,2
32038,It's not.,32038,2
32038,It's extremely tight (I wear a medium usually) and barely goes past my waste.,32038,2
32038,Very disappointed,32038,2
32039,Size large runs small,32039,2
32040,A little to big,32040,2
32041,I LOVED this wallet but the snap on the front was always very tight.,32041,2
32041,After 2 months of use it's already ripped out of the material and now has to be trashed.,32041,2
32041,I'm super disappointed since I loved everything else about it.,32041,2
32042,"quality not wat expected, in my country I would find much better",32042,2
32043,"Glasses were as expected, but there was supposed to be a cleaning kit and a second pair of SD glasses.",32043,2
32043,Only received the Ray bans.,32043,2
32043,Had to email back and was told would receive the missing items but as of today nothing.,32043,2
32043,Kind of screwed up a Christmas gift.,32043,2
32044,"Nice decal design, but the fabric quality is not very good, it had a big white spot on bottom of shirt that could not be removed by washing it.",32044,2
32045,I wear a large.,32045,2
32045,Ordered an extra large.,32045,2
32045,It is too small.,32045,2
32045,"While the fabric IS real thin, this would be okay during the warm months.",32045,2
32045,Not sure if it will hold up in the washing machine.,32045,2
32045,May have to hand wash.,32045,2
32045,"The color was not mentioned in the ad, the picture looked blue, shirt is black.",32045,2
32045,"Didn't need another black shirt, needed for a blue skirt.",32045,2
32045,I am going to check out my return options but for seven bucks I may just give it away.,32045,2
32046,They say medium  but  more like small short,32046,2
32047,I wear a medium but ordered a large for more comfort.,32047,2
32047,"The large became just right, so it actually runs smaller.",32047,2
32047,"The hoodie length from my shoulder was way too short, therefore I couldn't put the hoodie over my head.",32047,2
32047,"The material is on the cheaper side, and the white fluffy hoodie doesnt look anything like the picture.",32047,2
32047,"Also the white padded part doesnt go all the way down or around, its just on the hoodie.",32047,2
32047,The zipper was a little flimsy...pull too hard and it might break.,32047,2
32048,Ran small.,32048,2
32049,Not true to size,32049,2
32050,the closure in neckline is too hard to latch closed in back,32050,2
32051,"Item arrived broken, so it was not usable.",32051,2
32052,Absolutely no support in the bust.,32052,2
32052,The top was a big disappointment.,32052,2
32052,The pants fit well but like the top are made of a cheap material.,32052,2
32052,Cute style but disappointing overall.,32052,2
32053,"Based on the overall star rating and cost, I purchased this kit as a gift.",32053,2
32053,"Not long after, it shipped.",32053,2
32053,"When I got the notification it had shipped, I decided to look at the reviews (something I almost always do BEFORE buying).",32053,2
32053,"I found that the reviews were pretty bad and it was too late to cancel, so I spent at least as much or more buying shoe shine products to augment this one including Huberd's Shoe Grease and several Kiwi polish products.",32053,2
32053,The quality of this thing is pretty cheap and actually looks even cheaper in person.,32053,2
32053,"With a little bit of creativity, you can make a better kit yourself for about the same price or a bit more, but be proud of it and not cut a corner.",32053,2
32054,Fit is .,32054,2
32054,.,32054,2
32054,.,32054,2
32054,Odd.,32054,2
32054,The wires come down really far on the sides and it's just a kind of bizarre fit.,32054,2
32055,Returned it!,32055,2
32055,STrange fit not as pictured.,32055,2
32056,Returned product because it was very poorly made and did not look like picture at all.,32056,2
32056,A cheap nylon fabric and everything was just screen printed on.,32056,2
32056,The mouse head looked like swiss cheese.,32056,2
32057,Cheap material,32057,2
32058,I had to return this outfit as it is way too big for a newborn.,32058,2
32058,"The sizing is more like 9-12 months and at that point my baby will not be ""brand new"" which defeats the point of the outfit altogether!",32058,2
32058,"The quality was okay for the price, the sequin definitely would have come off within a couple of washes, though.",32058,2
32059,Decent hoodie.,32059,2
32059,The size is nice.,32059,2
32059,I usually wear extra large hoodies.,32059,2
32059,For some reason I thought this would be smaller (i.e.,32059,2
32059,"something labeled as ""large"" actually being the size of a ""small"".)",32059,2
32059,but the sizing was just right.,32059,2
32059,Order to what you usually wear.,32059,2
32059,Definitely for show rather than utility.,32059,2
32059,The zipper on the chest and the two button flaps serve no purpose.,32059,2
32059,The only two pockets are the two zippered ones on the side.,32059,2
32059,I like that they're larger pockets and out to the sides more.,32059,2
32059,I can fit my hands all the way in.,32059,2
32059,"The fact that they're zippered is annoying though, could be rough rubbing against your wrists.",32059,2
32059,"The hoodie feels warm, but I haven't had a chance to wear it on a windy day so I don't know how well it will protect against that.",32059,2
32059,"The primary zipper is probably my biggest nitpick, although this may be a matter of preference.",32059,2
32059,The zipper slider is on the left-hand side.,32059,2
32059,This is completely opposite to every other bit of clothing I wear which doesn't have a centralized slider.,32059,2
32059,They're always on the right-hand side.,32059,2
32059,The zipper doesn't feel like the most well made thing and I suspect that if I'm not paying attention and pull things wrong it'll start to come apart.,32059,2
32059,Something to keep an eye on.,32059,2
32059,The patch on the right arm seems completely out of place.,32059,2
32059,No idea why it's even there.,32059,2
32059,I checked some of their other clothes here on Amazon to see if maybe it was a company logo but it doesn't seem to be.,32059,2
32059,Would have been nice not to have it.,32059,2
32059,Overall a decent hoodie.,32059,2
32059,"At the time of my purchase I paid $32.99, which is definitely too high for what you get.",32059,2
32059,I have hoodies less than half that cost which are comperable or even better.,32059,2
32059,"If you see it for like $20 or less, that's probably a fair deal.",32059,2
32059,**Update** After a little more time with the hoodie I decided to return it.,32059,2
32059,"I had a chance to test it out during a windy, somewhat rainy day, and it was pretty useless.",32059,2
32059,But the zippers ended up being just too much of a nuisance.,32059,2

32116,).,32116,2

32117,"The crotch/legs doesn't have enough snaps so his diaper was hanging out all day, and by the end of the day, the snaps began ripping out of the very lightweight fabric.",32117,2
32117,Clearly I forgot to read the reviews before purchasing...I would definitely have picked something else.,32117,2

32118,But that's not my beef.,32118,2
32118,"The description says that the top has ""removable pads"" and says that it is lined.",32118,2

32118,"There was no lining in the top, which I could have lived with - I was on vacation - who cares!",32118,2

32118,"It was ""poofy"" in the front.",32118,2
32118,Photoshop went a long way in these pictures.,32118,2
32119,These are an average set of tanks with thinner weight material.,32119,2
32119,"I'm 5'2"", 103 lbs with a 30"" bust and got the Medium because I'm not a fan of ultra tight.",32119,2
32119,These were just too baggy and I don't think they'll shrink up enough even in the wash to fit properly.,32119,2
32119,"The straps felt too wide in the front, and the cut is not scooped enough under the arms to be comfortable.",32119,2
32119,I did receive 12 unique colors though!,32119,2
32120,"Very heavy if you need to carry it, plus it is off balance so it falls over- doesn't stand up on its own",32120,2
32121,"Definitely can't be used as a pick, so I have no idea why they shaped it like one.",32121,2
32122,The Xl was to small,32122,2

32124,Slides all over during the day.,32124,2

32130,its kind of weird.,32130,2
32130,"its ok quality, and the small is kinda medium if u are really small.",32130,2
32131,The fabric on this was way too shear and it ran a little small.,32131,2
32131,I had to send it back.,32131,2
32132,"The pattern of the pants is perfect, and the material is a good quality, but the waistline elastic is very tight and the pants are NOT flowy-- They could be worn as leggings, maybe, but NOT palazzo pants.",32132,2

32135,!,32135,2
32136,Took an extra day to get to me.,32136,2
32136,Otherwise a good cheap glove.,32136,2
32136,Amazon shipping caused this to be a 2 star rating.,32136,2
32136,I have prime shipping at that.,32136,2
32137,"Does not stretch wide enough to make a difference and I was expecting a pair, not 1",32137,2
32138,"i purchased a large and it couldn t fit, large is my normally size, i also purchased a xl large for sister and i try that on it still doesnt fit it was still small.",32138,2
32138,therefore these shirts you have to up your sizes twice.,32138,2
32138,that means is a 2xl large will be suitable.,32138,2
32138,no way,32138,2
32139,Very short body on this jumpsuit.,32139,2
32139,I sent it back.,32139,2

32145,"Not terrible, just not what I wanted.",32145,2
32145,"Also, the scarf is labeled ""cashmere"", but the product description is ""viscose"".",32145,2
32145,Debating if it would be worth a return.,32145,2
32145,It was only $9.99 and I could end up paying almost as much for shipping back to China.,32145,2
32146,Shirt is way too small and image is not as sharp as pictured.,32146,2
32146,Would not buy again.,32146,2
32147,Made for someone with an extremely short torso.,32147,2
32147,I don't have a particularly long torso as I don't have issues with other clothes.,32147,2

32149,Flimsy chain broke less than five minutes after putting it on.,32149,2
32150,"Good bag love the design but not ment to hold big text books  binders at the most but I personally use the bag as a camera/ laptop bag the only complaint is the inside zipper was spilt a little ( there is a picture ) but zipping it up fixed it
Edit - had the bag for about the month with careful use and the leather zipper things fell off and on one the metal broke to where I can't even fix it quite disappointed",32150,2
32151,See through.,32151,2
32152,It rusted immediately.,32152,2
32152,Don't get it wet!,32152,2
32153,Nice and thick but very very flowy in the front.,32153,2
32153,I ordered small and I wear a medium and I am sending back.,32153,2
32153,Not a good look.,32153,2
32154,No arch support at all.,32154,2
32154,Completely flat inside.,32154,2
32154,For $80 a pair I don't expect to have to buy arch supports separately.,32154,2
32154,"Also, a bit too small.",32154,2
32154,"I wear an 8.5 in every other shoe brand, but in these I'd need a 9, if I was going to return and reorder them, which I'm not.",32154,2
32154,I'll can find something with a built in arch support in Nike or Addidas.,32154,2
32154,They look cool though.,32154,2
32155,"I have average sized feet, but these fit too snug around the toes and ball of the foot.",32155,2
32155,"Yes, I tried simply pulling a little slack of the end of each toe, but then they were too long on the toe.",32155,2
32155,"Give it a try, you can always return if they don't fit YOU.",32155,2
32156,"Cheap fabric, at least 3 sizes too small.",32156,2
32157,These are def.,32157,2
32157,more kid sized - perfect for my 6 yr old.,32157,2
32157,However too small for my arms.,32157,2

32158,"I'm a small person but def could go bigger, not sure why this shirt is so short framed and cheaply made.",32158,2
32159,Not as stretchy as I thought.,32159,2
32160,Shirt fits fine and the cotton was a little thin but the quality of the print on the shirt was poor.,32160,2
32160,It looked like some of the print had rubbed off with missing spots all over.,32160,2
32160,Did not bother returning it since it would have cost me $5 for the return shipping which is a third of the price of the shirt.,32160,2
32160,I'll just use it but was disappointed.,32160,2
32161,"Great belt, exactly what I was looking for.",32161,2
32161,The only thing is that I had to add more holes in the belt (which I see were other complaints).,32161,2
32161,Must have been made for a person with an 18 inch waist.,32161,2
32161,Luckily there was room to spare.,32161,2
32162,"Although the mersuments said it was to my size, when it came into the mail i found out it was way smaller than expected.",32162,2
32162,It is also a very thin material and the buttons seems loose.,32162,2
32162,Over all the pattern was super cute and if it was my size i would have still kept the product.,32162,2
32163,"Order 2 sizes to big, top fits fine, vest a tad small but pants a little big.",32163,2
32163,Not awful material but they could use something better.,32163,2
32163,Orange lining cheap and frays and zipper cheap and poorly sown.,32163,2
32163,It is very cute but you might need to do some work on it.,32163,2
32164,"Bought this coat for my wife, purchased an extra large because we heard they ran small.",32164,2
32164,"It didn't even fit her, we were looking for a large.",32164,2
32164,Ended up giving it to somebody that was like a small.,32164,2
32164,Fits more like a child's XL,32164,2
32165,Look better in the picture,32165,2
32166,the suit was too small  bands around torso were too tight  no stretch,32166,2
32167,I had to sew the Winnie head onto the slipper within 5 minutes.,32167,2
32167,Workmanship is poor.,32167,2
32167,I do not suggest buying these slippers.,32167,2
32168,Too small.,32168,2
32168,Not as big as it appears,32168,2
32169,This necklace looked very small.,32169,2
32169,The cross is really big and the long black chains gives it a different look tat i don't desire.,32169,2
32170,So much smaller than other sets with these sizes,32170,2
32171,This would be a beautiful dress if the halter part was a bit larger.,32171,2
32171,"The top is flimsy and very small, providing no coverage.",32171,2
32171,"I have other dresses of a similar cut, so its not the cut of the dress, this dress is made with an unproportionally small top.",32171,2
32171,"Other than that the fabric was a decent quality, especially for the price.",32171,2
32171,The skirt did not look as textured as it does in the picture however.,32171,2
32172,Can't adjust and was a little big,32172,2
32173,Logo was a little faded.,32173,2
32173,Like it was made in someone's garage,32173,2
32174,"I had to take my ring off to put them on and after I did, I couldn't get my ring back on.",32174,2
32175,Just way to short.,32175,2
32176,"Loved the colors and image, but after washing only twice the image is already peeling.",32176,2
32176,Great other than that,32176,2
32177,This cropped shirt is potentially awesome but the cropped part comes just below my chest.,32177,2
32177,Am doing I have a small one.,32177,2
32177,If it was larger it would barely drape over.,32177,2
32177,Was wanting it to be more mid-drift.,32177,2
32177,Looks awkward.,32177,2
32177,The material though is soft and it is well constructed in my opinion.,32177,2
32177,Just wish it was longer.,32177,2
32178,"The dress is pretty and the colors are great, but it is too short!",32178,2
32178,It comes to mid shin.,32178,2
32179,"Loved the look of this top on the model; however, when I pulled it out of the package I was surprised by how cheap the entire shirt was.",32179,2
32179,"Awful sew job, seams are uneven and messy, material was mediocre to poor, and the see-through mesh neckline looks like it was just slapped onto the shirt... has potential to be a great top if the stitching was higher quality.",32179,2
32179,"The size/fit was good and the hem was flattering, but not worth the money..",32179,2
32180,Nice material but way too large.,32180,2
32181,The glow on the inside is like  it's been painted.,32181,2
32181,I think of it gets wet it will be done for.,32181,2
32182,Didn't hold up very well,32182,2
32183,"It is a very cute dress, well let me rephrase that!",32183,2
32183,cute shirt!,32183,2
32183,It is WAY TOO short.,32183,2
32184,These are decent orthotics with adequate support/stiffness however these cane too narrow for my shoes.,32184,2
32184,I can feel the edge if the insert against my big toe.,32184,2
32184,The insert should be a little wider.,32184,2
32185,I love Vionic/Orthaheel shoes and these are very nice but I can not believe these are described as WHITE!,32185,2
32185,They are not.,32185,2
32185,I took a picture where you can clearly see the tissue paper inside the shoe which IS white.,32185,2
32185,These shoes are almost a pale yellow.,32185,2
32185,Very disappointed; so misleading!,32185,2
32186,"Did not meet expectations, made poorly and no thigh highs were included.",32186,2
32187,I ordered in medium for my mother.,32187,2
32187,"The pants may be a medium, but the top looks like an extra large.",32187,2
32187,This would not fit any type of body.,32187,2
32188,The shirt is much smaller than it should be for extra large since I have many extra large shirts that fit perfectly this one is skin tight!,32188,2
32188,I am very sorry that I bought it!,32188,2
32189,fit to small I had to donate it,32189,2
32190,Looks great and most of the time works great.,32190,2
32190,A few times already the date has dropped a couple days behind.,32190,2
32190,"The second tiny loop to hold the band moves way easily and slides forward or backward, letting the band go.",32190,2
32190,I just glued it in-place and will see if that helps it.,32190,2
32190,"UPDATE
Yes, Super-Glue worked great to keep the loop in place holding the band.",32190,2
32190,"UPDATE 5/2/2016
Had numerous times when the date falls behind.",32190,2
32190,Just happened again today.,32190,2
32190,"Not cool, it F's me up.",32190,2
32191,want to exchange,32191,2
32192,"Very thin material, tore very easily.",32192,2
32192,Also sizing is not accurate at all.,32192,2
32192,"Ordered it because it would be larger than what we needed, but it ended up being WAY smaller than the specs said it would be!",32192,2
32192,I definitely recommend you look for another one!,32192,2
32193,Too narrow for a XXL tie.,32193,2
32193,Does not have a proportional length/wide.,32193,2
32194,didn't look like the dress in the picture,32194,2
32195,very thin can see through,32195,2
32196,Clothes fit very tight,32196,2
32197,I returned these as they were weirdly shaped - the crotch came way too low and the legs were way too short.,32197,2
32197,"Too bad, as the print was cute.",32197,2
32198,Actual shirt is not as attractive,32198,2
32199,Not what I thought.,32199,2
32199,Color was diff & it's open on top.,32199,2
32199,What's that about??,32199,2
32199,Crazy.,32199,2
32199,Disappointed.,32199,2
32200,I was disappointed.,32200,2
32200,"Its really cute, it just fits too small.",32200,2
32200,You need to order one size larger.,32200,2
32201,Not real gems..just painted metal.,32201,2
32202,"You definitely get what you pay for, and to me it wasn't worth the price.",32202,2
32202,"Very, very thin.",32202,2
32202,All the edges of the material look cut off and unfinished to me.,32202,2
32202,Odd shape especially with the pockets.,32202,2
32202,"The belt doesn't wrap around several times like the picture, it only comes together to tie.",32202,2
32202,I haven't washed it yet but I will definitely put it on hand wash/gentle cycle because it looks like it will either shrink terribly or shred apart.,32202,2
32202,"I knew right away when I saw the bag it came in that it was going to be a disappointment, it was shoved into a tiny like 6 inch by 4 inch shipping bag.",32202,2
32203,"Shirt is nice, but made in China.",32203,2
32203,The sizing is so different than US.,32203,2
32203,Bought xxl and fits a women misses size 6.,32203,2
32203,Have to resell to a smaller person.,32203,2
32204,"Way too small, definitely designed for a skinny guy with no muscle tone.",32204,2
32204,"I could wear it, but I looked and felt like I was going to hulk out of it.",32204,2
32204,I'm 6'2 200 lbs.,32204,2
32205,I'm normally a medium and this felt like an extra small.,32205,2
32206,"Hat was misshapen, shoes were way too big",32206,2
32207,"Not impressed with size, quality or color!",32207,2
32208,I was so excited to order this product because I've been wanting it for months.,32208,2
32208,I love this style dress.,32208,2
32208,And when I revived it I was very disappointed.,32208,2
32208,It looked cheap.,32208,2
32208,And I put it on and I was too big and then I looked at the size and I got a medium instead of a small.,32208,2
32208,Now I have to go through the whole process of returning it.,32208,2
32208,Last time I buy a dress online.,32208,2
32209,It is oversized even for toddlers.,32209,2
32210,"I think its just way too thick and kinda small , if you looking for a winter pants for that reason is cool but if not , don't buy !",32210,2
32211,It was alright didn't really look like the picture but couldn't beat the price,32211,2
32212,Awkward fit for normal/large chested people.,32212,2
32213,way small gave to wife,32213,2
32214,The top was kind of snug and the bottoms were huge,32214,2
32215,I was too small.,32215,2
32215,I guess I chose the wrong size,32215,2
32216,"Material on the top is very, very thin so unless you have a bikini body (which I don't lol) you are not going to hide any imperfections in this suit.",32216,2
32216,I am going to keep this however because unlike the top the bottoms are lined and fit great :)  The hunt for a top continues.... :),32216,2
32217,The size fits a bit smaller than expect.,32217,2
32217,But the product is fairly ok otherwise.,32217,2
32218,loved the suit.,32218,2
32218,the bra made me look like Madonna on stage.,32218,2
32218,had to return it,32218,2

32220,This is for tiny women.,32220,2
32221,These are nice looking glasses that fit well and are reasonably high quality.,32221,2
32221,"However, I have bought and returned two sets of them because of a design flaw.",32221,2
32221,"One of the lenses appears to be misshapen, causing it to pop out of the frame under very little pressure.",32221,2
32221,"I have had the lens pop out while just sitting in my car, and while just being held normally.",32221,2
32221,"The first time I bought these glasses, I was willing to assume it was a one time defect.",32221,2
32221,"Having received the second pair, I am sure that this is a permanent issue.",32221,2
32222,This shirt has a sexy potential but disappoints overall.,32222,2
32222,"The stitching is adequate, but i don't think will hold few laundry rounds.",32222,2
32222,I like the collar and button detail.,32222,2
32222,I like it more than the short sleeve version (this one has long sleeves not 3/4).,32222,2
32222,"The laid back surfer look can be achieved, provided one gets correct size.",32222,2
32222,"The rule seems to be: if you were born and raised on US food, or at least ate it for a lifespan of a guinea pig, go at least 1 size up (2 for more lounging feel) from advised chart.",32222,2
32222,"People with super solid genetic skinny frame, can stick to provided sizes and totally rock the look.",32222,2

32233,I returned and got a refund.,32233,2
32234,I received these a while ago I did not know what to make of it the headbands are ok good quality that's why I gave it 2 stars but since they are sending everyone the wrong item I don't think that's ok since it's a waste of our time you are ordering the correct item number just the picture is wrong on this site I don't really like to make bad reviews it rubs me the wrong way but I have to be completely honest with this item don't.,32234,2
32234,"This seller has a lot of great items and I have purchased before from them they have all been good great quality as pictured and everything, now these are where something is wrong the main picture needs to be updated to what we they really send out for this item so it's good to always read the reviews before buying my mistake I did not but yes this is my honest opinion , I did receive this at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion so here you go.",32234,2

32238,The top is literally a wrap you put around.,32238,2
32238,I thought it was sewed to this style but its not.,32238,2
32239,It is not newborn size.,32239,2

32241,"This tunic is a beautiful color, but sizing must run really small because it's WAY too tight.",32241,2
32241,"I won't be returning it because I need to original packaging/shipping bagto send it back, which I unfortunately destryed in the process of opening everything.",32241,2
32241,"Instead, I will be asking a younger cousin of mine if she wants the 2 that I purchased, and will not repurchase more.",32241,2
32241,"Fot aside, the material is very thin; outlines and colors of bras and undershirts can be clearly seen through the material (even light colors!)",32241,2
32241,and that is a pet peeve of mine.,32241,2
32241,It's a shame because I really like the pink and grey colors of the 2 that I bought.,32241,2

32252,Really fits for a 6 year old.,32252,2
32253,Runs very small.,32253,2
32253,It was going to cost too much to return it so I just kept it even thought I don't wear it.,32253,2
32254,The crossover design in front lays weird.,32254,2
32254,I wore it once to a funeral and fussed with those all day long.,32254,2
32255,Not a woman's size.,32255,2
32256,It's not like they say.,32256,2
32256,You can't put two pair of glasses in it without crushing them.,32256,2
32256,As far as that print it's very nice.i use it for one pair of glasses.,32256,2
32257,couldn't wear on different fingers cuz they are all the same size,32257,2
32258,It was small and I had to return.,32258,2
32258,The pattern seemed to be printed on the inside of the shirt.,32258,2
32259,It was great while it lasted but now has several years.,32259,2
32259,The heaviest I carried in the bag was 4 9.5 water bottles.,32259,2
32260,"So far, it looks and feels like something I cheap, but I'll see if it holds up.",32260,2
32261,Nice looking and seems like decent quality but the color is staining after one week from the black cloth bag they give you.,32261,2
32262,Great quality product except mine was missing a diamond when I received it...,32262,2
32262,Working on returning and getting a replacement but I love the color and its the PERFECT size!,32262,2

32266,"Irritated to find out that these are 16g, not 14.",32266,2
32266,I waited a whole month for them to ship here and I can't even wear them.,32266,2
32266,This should be specified.,32266,2
32266,Otherwise the rings are sturdy looking.,32266,2
32267,I'm not happy with this.,32267,2
32267,"It came on time, it had everything it said it would, just the jewelry doesn't fit the needles.",32267,2

32272,I am normally in between a medium and a large order a X large and still to small,32272,2
32273,"Little disappointed , was packaged and has  a crease across the body, the trim looks like vinyl not leather, but is a great size.",32273,2
32273,Does not compare to the quality of my 1st DB purse .,32273,2
32274,Was cute but half of one of the arms was not even sewed together and was two separate pieces.,32274,2
32275,I'm not sure why I even gave this product  two stars.,32275,2
32275,I guess because it did serve its purpose and the price was good for receiving 10 items.,32275,2
32275,"However, did they serve their purpose?",32275,2
32275,Absolutely not.,32275,2
32275,"First of all, the reason I (and I would suspect most people) ordered these was to plug a piercing and make it not noticeable while I was at work.",32275,2
32275,"Well, these are not translucent.",32275,2
32275,"Very opaque, almost milky or creamy and was quite obvious.",32275,2
32275,And not flat.,32275,2
32275,"Also, it is in two pieces.",32275,2
32275,I had to take the post off and replace it after placing the main piece.,32275,2
32275,"Mind you, My piercing is in my nose.",32275,2
32275,It's a miracle that i was able to accomplish this task.,32275,2
32275,"Lastly, the plastic is pretty rough.",32275,2
32275,Not smooth.,32275,2
32275,I wouldn't buy them again and would even return them if I wasn't such a slacker.,32275,2
32276,"order according to their size chart - bust area way to small , dress does not flow as picture.",32276,2
32276,Beautiful colors,32276,2
32277,"I wish it had been bigger, and that I would have had the thigh-highs to go with it...",32277,2
32278,not what I expected,32278,2
32279,Very small,32279,2
32280,"It discolored very quickly, even with me putting a sealer in first.",32280,2
32281,At first the pants were great.,32281,2
32281,They fit perfectly and were comfortable.,32281,2
32281,Now almost 6 months later they have shrunk to the point that I cannot wear them anymore.,32281,2
32281,I'm really bummed because I was hoping they'd last for a few years.,32281,2
32282,I assumed they would fit over my prescriptionglasses.,32282,2
32282,They did not.,32282,2
32283,Did not like the material,32283,2
32284,"The picture made me think it was rose gold, when in reality it is silver",32284,2
32285,After the first washing they were nearly too small,32285,2
32286,Top part way too big for my breast bottom fit fine but did not match top at all,32286,2
32287,I bought the purple and pink owl bracelets for my daughter and her teacher.,32287,2
32287,They are cheaply made but they were less than a dollar.,32287,2
32287,You get what you pay for.,32287,2
32287,It's like a plastic type material.,32287,2
32287,It's not soft.,32287,2
32288,These are absolutely beautiful and I wish I could wear them.,32288,2
32288,But apparently my nipples are too wide for them to click properly.,32288,2
32288,"Just what I needed: another way to feel ""too big.""",32288,2
32288,Really wish I could wear them.,32288,2
32288,Would probably be better for someone with more petite nipples.,32288,2
32289,I like the style idea but the necklace itself was made cheaply; the fabric feels grimey and one strand is much longer than the other so it looks awkward when it's on.,32289,2
32290,I bought the xl after reading comments.,32290,2
32290,"I am 5.9, 125 lbs.",32290,2
32290,"The shirt is cute, and I'll wear it, but it's a bit large... but because of the flow style it can be pulled off.",32290,2
32290,"Quality is not very good... looks cheap, but it was cheap, so no big.",32290,2
32290,"All in all, it's meh.",32290,2
32291,Good looking watch but the band is so stiff that it becomes unconformable to wear!,32291,2
32291,If it had a different band this watch would get 5 Stars...,32291,2
32292,Poor quality.,32292,2
32292,"The bracelet has a mistake in the weaving in one spot (only one thread is wound correctly, not both) so there is a gap in the design.",32292,2
32292,"Both ring and bracelet have a small bead holding the ends of the ""thread"" together.",32292,2
32292,Not a big issue on the bracelet but feels uncomfortable on the ring.,32292,2
32292,"If you put the bead on top of the finger (like a ring with a stone/jewel), then you don't see the pattern of the weave and it loses the ""tatoo"" look.",32292,2
32293,Not deep enough,32293,2
32294,It does not fit well.,32294,2
32294,Runs larger than stated size.,32294,2
32294,Looks better in the picture.,32294,2
32294,Material is thinner than expected.,32294,2
32295,"Very pretty stones, but should have spent a little more, sterling is very very light weight and the clasp is mininmal, nice design but don't waste your money.",32295,2
32296,"I have a very large bust, Triple D, to be pressie, so i figured I'd buy the XXL just to make sure it would fit around the ""Girl's"".",32296,2
32296,"Boy does it fit them and I could even push for a way bigger set of ""Girl's"" too!!!",32296,2
32296,"I should've ordered just an XL- I will never wear this, it was a waste of $$$ .",32296,2
32296,It's like I'm swimming in it!,32296,2
32297,I went with my foot measurement and not my usual shoe size and these shoes are painfully small!,32297,2
32297,I cannot stand in these shoes comfortably.,32297,2
32297,I'm sure if I could have ordered a whole size up they would be fine.,32297,2
32297,"But the fact that I went with the size chart and it was incorrect, and the majority of the reviews I read were about how well the shoes fit is irritating.",32297,2
32297,I'm currently trying to stretch the shoes out since the leather is soft.,32297,2
32297,Hopefully that will solve my problem.,32297,2
32298,"This necklace will not hang right,keeps flipping over.",32298,2
32298,I was so excited because it matches rings and earings I ordered.,32298,2
32298,Items are not that easy to return because of lack of paperwork.,32298,2
32298,I kept the necklace hoping to come up with breaking it apart and using a single rose.,32298,2
32298,Not worth the price,32298,2
32299,"This purse got 2 stars based on design and color, it's loose and roomy and functional while looking natural and rugged..  however...",32299,2
32299,It smells like a loose woman who hasn't showered in 2 months.,32299,2
32299,"Faux leather is always a gamble, but based on reviews I decided it was too good to pass up as it met my aesthetic desires and needs.",32299,2
32299,"But my gosh, this rotten fish smell.",32299,2
32299,I need to chat it in leather oil simply so it can rid the smell.. after airing it out for two weeks.. it still wafts smells of funk.,32299,2
32299,"You can imagine my apprehension in ever taking it in public, without having to give it a disclaimer that it's not me!",32299,2
32300,I am an extra large and I  .,32300,2
32300,Ordered sn xxl but it was to small at least one SIZE.,32300,2
32301,Perfect fit but odd splotch of ink on the breast area making for weird looks.,32301,2
32302,"tried to contact seller to exchange for a larger size, but they have not responded to my inquiry.",32302,2
32302,"My son loved the shirt, but the size is not right (too tight).",32302,2
32302,Would like to be able to exchange as the print is awesome and my son really liked the shirt.,32302,2
32303,My husband bought this as a Christmas gift for me and since it says it fits smaller I told him to order the largest size (3X) which is 2 sizes larger than I normally wear and it is way too small to wear.,32303,2
32303,Fits like a Large.,32303,2
32303,The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I think it's really cute.,32303,2
32304,The chain came apart as soon as I took it out of the package.,32304,2
32305,would fit someone that wears 0X,32305,2
32306,"The medium was small and Im 4""10 but have curvy hips.",32306,2
32306,The lace on the dress did not match the lace on the cover up.,32306,2
32306,It comes with two pairs of string for underwear but I not taking it back because of timing.,32306,2
32306,I recommend that people buy large...,32306,2
32306,The medium is a small.,32306,2
32307,The elastic around the legs are really loose.,32307,2
32307,Not comfortable to wear.,32307,2
32307,Would buy a smaller size that might help.,32307,2
32307,Don't recommend.,32307,2
32308,not true to size,32308,2
32309,"I am 5'2"" 101 lbs but this dress was still a bit snug and very odd to get in and out of.",32309,2
32309,Returned it for a medium but had to return it also.,32309,2
32309,Way too big.,32309,2
32309,"The dress looks cute in the picture, just didn't work for me.",32309,2
32310,Runs small and very cheaply made.,32310,2
32311,Very pretty but built in slip is much smaller than the dress.,32311,2
32312,Thought they'd help with slipping but they move Around too much.,32312,2
32312,Ended up taking them off.,32312,2
32313,Looks great at first.,32313,2
32313,After a while (1-2 months in my experience) you start to notice the black paint wearing off here and there.,32313,2
32313,"And then you notice the clasp opening randomly, causing your watch to fall off at inopportune times -- walking down the street... sitting at your desk... standing in front of a urinal... you can guess the rest.",32313,2
32313,"Needless to say, that kinda sucks.",32313,2
32313,"But hey, at least they include the springs and tool with the watch band, which comes in handy when changing it out for the next one...",32313,2
32314,Its very large and wrinkles at the slightest touch.,32314,2
32314,Very hard to wear and I have only tried to wear once but ended up coming home to change because it just doesn't sit right on the body.,32314,2
32315,cheap looking,32315,2
32316,Nice but very small.,32316,2
32316,I would say it's size s,32316,2
32317,the top was a small but the shorts were medium.,32317,2
32317,shorts were to big.,32317,2
32318,It is missing  the bow tie and cufflinks,32318,2
32319,"Looks better in picture, color is not the same, the sleeves are too tight",32319,2
32320,The lace was not sheer as in the picture.,32320,2
32320,The material was sewn much higher.,32320,2
32320,Needed to have it altered.,32320,2
32321,"I had previously purchased a v-neck shirt from Doublju that I loved as well as a long-sleeved shirt which I didn't, so I knew upon purchasing this that it would be a bit of a hit or miss for me, but I took a chance because the v-neck is one of my favorite shirts.",32321,2
32321,"I have recently lost 50lbs with an intent to lose 50 more, so I need cheap shirts to get me through the interim until I reach goal.",32321,2
32321,"Doublju is a Chinese company, as the vast majority of more inexpensive shirts on Amazon are, which means most of them do not cut their shirts to American size standards.",32321,2
32321,This usually means a XXL shirt is now a 5X!,32321,2
32321,Talk about a confidence crusher.,32321,2
32321,"I could not find a complete size chart that listed their large size, but I took a gamble and tried a XXL, one size larger than my current size, thinking if the sizing on this was similar to the same shirt I had bought previously, it would be a lovely fit.",32321,2
32321,I was wrong.,32321,2
32321,"While the bottom half of this shirt was comfortably form-fitting (not like the dreaded sausage casing but tight enough to hug my favorite feature--my hourglass shape), the top half was a complete mess of weird bagging and puckering.",32321,2
32321,I am be no means a small-chested lady.,32321,2
32321,"At my largest, I was sporting a 42DD.",32321,2
32321,"Now, I'm more like a 40D, but I think even if I were still rocking a gargantuan rack, this would still be too big for me.",32321,2
32321,"I could fit another pair of arms through the arm holes--I mean, the fabric was literally folding like a tortilla under my arms, and the back had a huge gap above my bra.",32321,2
32321,"The straps, the deciding style feature in my purchase, are a confused mess.",32321,2
32321,"They cross in the middle in a weave as picture, but they are bulkier than the delicate spaghetti straps I expected and despite the weaving, they go all willy-nilly across my back.",32321,2
32321,"I think if the top had fit correctly to my frame and if I spent a moment really fiddling with them, they could look great, but it simply won't work for me.",32321,2
32321,"Also, I purchase this in ""light red"", which looks orange on the monitor, but is more like coral red in person.",32321,2
32321,Not as punchy or striking as I had hoped.,32321,2
32321,"It's going back, but I will probably still try a future purchase from this company because when they get it right, they knock it out of the park.",32321,2
32322,"Love the colors and quality of this purse, but ours came with the cloth separation from the trim which was not acceptable.",32322,2
32322,I am returning the product.,32322,2
32323,I ordered a small for my sister.,32323,2
32323,The tag says Small but it is the size of an XL :(,32323,2
32324,Fit is very awkward.,32324,2
32324,sleeves are too short and the torso was way too loose; it looks weird when wearing it.,32324,2
32325,"The tights are supper cute, but were really small around my waist.",32325,2
32325,"They are ""a one size fits all"" but be careful if you are heavier around the stomach.",32325,2
32325,Im a size 12.,32325,2
32326,"Although this kimono looks nice, the sleeves are way tighter than they should be.",32326,2
32326,It is wearable but would look much better with looser sleeves.,32326,2
32326,Not what I expected.,32326,2
32327,I like the quality that they were in but I only got one of each size instead of two.,32327,2
32327,So yeah.,32327,2
32327,Great quality.,32327,2
32327,But very unhappy that I only got one gauge each size instead of two like what I thought I was getting.,32327,2
32328,Too small,32328,2
32329,"Color is cool, fit is off.",32329,2
32329,"The right side sits lower than the left, which produces a crooked look.",32329,2
32329,I guess you get what you pay for.,32329,2
32330,"I never got to wear it, when I tired it on the cheap zipper popped and it costs more than the dress to replace a zipper... what a bunch of crap I am sad because it is super adorable but tight in the chest, if you have small boobs it will fit perfect and true to size but if you have a larger chest you need to order a size up",32330,2
32331,Ran WAY too small.,32331,2
32331,Material was flimsy and cheap.,32331,2
32331,Returned it.,32331,2
32332,shoes slip off,32332,2
32333,To small but it kinda fits.,32333,2
32334,"I tried, did not work for me.",32334,2
32334,After trying these in several different shoes.,32334,2
32335,"The style is nice enough, but the frames are shinier than the matte look in the photo.",32335,2
32335,"More importantly, the lens are not uniform which makes it blurry in a specific spot and creates a ripple in your view if you move your head.",32335,2
32335,Spend more to get better glasses.,32335,2
32336,Noticed fraying of fabric after only second use.,32336,2
32336,Buckle latch does not appear very durable either.,32336,2
32336,Time will tell for certain,32336,2
32337,The stitching on the front of that hat was pretty uneven.,32337,2
32337,I generally wouldn't care but its noticeably bad.,32337,2
32338,Poor quality but for the price I wasn't surprised,32338,2
32339,BROKE TOO EASILY,32339,2
32340,I knew it was a risk ordering bras online but I really needed something.,32340,2
32340,Now they just sit in the dresser.,32340,2
32340,I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who is above a C. They are comfortable and supportive but my poor DDs are spilling out to the point I can't wear them.,32340,2
32340,Definitely recommend getting something with more coverage if you're a bigger chested lady.,32340,2
32341,material is not that great and it doesn't look as it's pictured on the model,32341,2
32342,Shipping was fast and that's where my happy ends.,32342,2
32342,The stones did not at all resemble the photo.,32342,2
32342,"We got a clear glass instead of opal looking stone, a plain black instead of the pretty marble looking one in the photo and the turquoise was plain without the lines.",32342,2
32342,Very disappointed.,32342,2
32343,Bought this kit for the pendant.,32343,2
32343,Pendant is not as nice as it is in the picture.,32343,2
32343,But still useful.,32343,2
32343,The pearl was just awful.,32343,2
32343,Lines and dents on the pearl.,32343,2
32343,It was a shame.,32343,2
32343,I give 2 stars because shipping was decently fast.,32343,2
32343,Would not recommend unless you plan to get some other pearl for the pendant.,32343,2
32343,Pictures: the black pearl was mine that I had put in there to show how it holds the pearl.,32343,2
32343,the pinkish white one is the one I receive with the kit.,32343,2
32344,"These PJ's also said they run small, so again, I ordered the next size up -- they barely fit.",32344,2
32344,I'll know better when I receive them back from the laundry.,32344,2
32345,"I am very busty, measure about 47 37 47.",32345,2
32345,"I am also very long through the torso, measuring about 73 when I put the tape on my shoulder down the back through the crotch and back up the torso to the neck.",32345,2
32345,I wear about a 38G bra - with lots of cleavage out of the bra.,32345,2
32345,This dress did not fit the bust area -  it is for busty gals - but was far too little for me.,32345,2
32345,Too much cleavage and some bra showed in the front when I pulled it to the proper spot under my breasts and it rode up in the back when I tried to position it properly in front.,32345,2
32345,Then it was 3 inches too long under the breast when I pulled it up to cover bra.,32345,2
32345,It had a fitted look everywhere else.,32345,2
32345,I think it runs slightly too big.,32345,2
32345,This dress would work wonderfully for someone who measured a cup size smaller than a G and a shorter torso.,32345,2
32345,IMO if you wear around a 34DDD - 38DD and a torso range of 50-60; I think this dress would be a dream come true.,32345,2
32346,It is spacious and does have a nice lengthy shoulder strap which was what I needed.,32346,2
32346,"However, when I received mine the zippers were a nightmare!",32346,2
32346,Two of them were so bad I couldn't even close the pockets with the zipper.,32346,2
32346,"I actually tore off the tip of my nail trying to get one of them to even close, so not very happy with it all.",32346,2
32347,"Perfect fit and the grey heather pattern wasnice, but it was too sheer!",32347,2
32347,I didn't even have to bend over to see my underwear through the leggings.,32347,2
32347,I can't imagine working out in these in public!,32347,2
32347,Returned using amazon's free return policy.,32347,2
32348,Kinda cheap and HUGE for a size large,32348,2
32349,"Came with a huge gash in the straw and as a straw hat enthusiast, I can say that the quality of this hat is terrible when compared to pretty much all of the competition (even a cheap $8 Budweiser hat I got at Walmart a while back).",32349,2
32349,Does it have stars under the brim?,32349,2
32349,"Yes, but for that price do yourself a favor and get something of higher quality.",32349,2
32350,Very thin and not like the ones I have purchased in baby boutiques.,32350,2
32351,"The delivery time, as a Custom piece is good for my need at the theatre",32351,2
32352,Nice dress and colors.,32352,2
32352,"I'm 5'6, 140 lbs, and 34 B bust.",32352,2
32352,I ordered a large and like most the problem was in the bust area.,32352,2
32352,It's way to snug.,32352,2
32352,The length of dress is like picture.,32352,2
32353,seems like a nice shirt except its huge.,32353,2
32353,I ordered a large but I'm swimming in it.,32353,2
32353,It doesn't have any labels to indicate the size so who knows what size it really is.,32353,2
32353,I'm going to wash it and see what happens.,32353,2
32354,Very pretty but VERY small.,32354,2
32355,"If you are planning on using this as a conch jewelry like the image, it is too big!",32355,2
32355,Wayyyy too big.,32355,2
32355,"I cut it in half so only 3 stones were on it, and it's still far too big for my conch piercing.",32355,2
32355,"It also screws from both sides of the post, which is pain and I'm worried it will get lost.",32355,2
32355,"But pro, it comes in a pair which I wasn't expecting.",32355,2
32356,"Cute but too small, can't fit over the chest, very risky.",32356,2
32357,Cheap and low quality.,32357,2
32358,Lovely but Fit was extremely small in sleeves Product returned,32358,2
32359,The watch arrived but does not run.,32359,2
32359,I'm guessing the battery has run down but I'm not going to run out to a jeweler to get the battery replaced on a brand new watch that could very well be defective.,32359,2
32359,The instructions mention that pulling out the crown should stop the watch and save the battery but the crown was pushed in when it arrived.,32359,2
32359,"The only option was to get a refund, no replacement, so I guess I'll look for a different seller.",32359,2
32359,"Otherwise, I was happy to see that the watch seemed to be of decent quality.",32359,2
32360,Poor quality!,32360,2
32360,!,32360,2
32361,"The fabric is polyester rather than cotton as most dashiki's are, hence it has a different look and fit than a normal dashiki.",32361,2
32361,"It's comfortable, but just doesn't fit/look like a normal dashiki",32361,2
32362,"Poor quality and worth maybe $40, not the $100 paid for it.",32362,2
32362,The packaging was very flimsy and shipping took long.,32362,2
32362,The jacket style is nice but the fit is small.,32362,2
32363,very cheap.,32363,2
32363,do not recomment,32363,2
32364,The pad is Very thin.,32364,2
32364,When I opened the packaging the pad smelled strongly of seafood (GROSS).,32364,2
32364,I had to let it air out outside for two and a half day before the smell went away.,32364,2
32364,"Also, and this is a biggy, all of the writing and pics on the pad are very blurry.",32364,2
32364,Very Poor Quality,32364,2
32365,"I originally bought the dress for myself, but i had no idea that the dress would be so small.",32365,2
32365,I had gotten the large but it was way too tiny.,32365,2
32365,I had to give it to my little sister.,32365,2
32365,Not too happy about this.,32365,2
32366,Not great quality considering the price.,32366,2
32367,Cute but returning.,32367,2
32367,Its a thin material and came much smaller than the size chart suggested.,32367,2
32368,I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF IT BUT CAN'T SAY HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE I DID NOT RECIEVE A POWER PLUG (CORD) WITH IT!,32368,2
32368,!,32368,2
32369,This is an absolutely beautiful dress.,32369,2
32369,"But unless you send in your measurements, it will NOT fit.",32369,2
32369,I cannot get it even close to getting zipped.,32369,2
32370,"Meh, don't waste your money.",32370,2
32370,"Pretty cheaply made but then again, the price is cheap.",32370,2
32370,Not worth it though.,32370,2
32371,Tarnished within 2 weeks,32371,2
32372,Fabric wrinkles even when garment is carefully folded.,32372,2
32372,Won't buy this again.,32372,2
32373,slides down,32373,2
32374,"Price wasn't bad but honestly quality is the same as I could get at the dollar store, I will have to keep them because I would not give them as a gift, quality is too poor, and you have to be careful as they will easily tear.",32374,2
32375,Not true to size.,32375,2
32376,It is a lot smaller then I was expecting,32376,2
32377,"strangely long legs, not comfortable",32377,2
32378,It's a nice bracelet if you like silver.,32378,2
32378,I thought I would get a gold or brass looking bracelet like he picture.,32378,2
32378,I don't care for silver.,32378,2
32378,But I didn't want to go through the return process.,32378,2
32379,Bought the XL which is sizing up for me.,32379,2
32379,They were still tight and hard to pull up.,32379,2
32379,"They look cute on, but keep slipping down!",32379,2
32379,They drive me crazy!,32379,2
32379,Definitely not good workout tights.,32379,2
32380,"Too small, and would not exchange",32380,2
32381,I read some previous reviews which indicated these pants ran somewhat small in the thighs.,32381,2
32381,"Well, not just thighs, the hips and waist are also small.",32381,2
32381,I usually wear a medium but with these pants I may need an extra large!,32381,2
32381,I'm going to reorder.,32381,2
32381,"The color, texture and fabric is as described and I like those aspects very much, but the sizing is quite off.",32381,2
32382,"The pattern is beautiful but the purse is heavy, the handles have too many clunky chains and makes a lot of noise.",32382,2
32382,The purse openings on all three purses are too small.,32382,2
32382,The strap is a loop and doesn't stay down.,32382,2
32382,Tried for 15 minutes to tighten it and finally gave up.,32382,2
32382,It also had a strong fish smell upon unwrapping the handbags.,32382,2
32382,Definitely returning.,32382,2
32382,It's a shame because the handbag itself is really pretty.,32382,2
32383,Very cheap and teeny tiny!,32383,2
32384,THIS IS A COPY OF A REAL ON... ITS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE & ITS CHEEPLY MADE,32384,2
32385,The material is somewhat very sheer and thin.,32385,2
32385,It doesn't look as good in person as it does online.,32385,2
32386,I wouldn't buy it again.,32386,2
32386,The thermal sleeves are alright but the gray part with the Lucky logo seems cheap and thin.,32386,2
32387,Cheap material and does not look like the picture at all,32387,2
32388,Their like play glasses,32388,2
32389,I was happy with most of the color combos until I noticed a bunch of them have pot leafs on them.....so I had to throw a number of them...,32389,2
32390,Set out when received had to glue.,32390,2
32391,Great design with snaps...too tight in legs.,32391,2
32391,My 24 month old is small & the large/XL were too tight.,32391,2
32392,No slouch at all..,32392,2
32392,But still warm.,32392,2
32392,Too small,32392,2
32393,Wasn't happy with the fabric quality super thin and wrinkled ridiculously easy..,32393,2
32394,"I bought the large and it fits like a small, the arms are short and it looks like a belly shirt.",32394,2
32395,"The slippers are very cute and do ""shed"" as others have said, but after just wearing them a couple times the stitching on the heel seam has come completely unstitched/split.",32395,2
32395,"According to the seller's return policy, once they're out of the bag, their ""100% guarantee"" is out the window.",32395,2
32395,Obviously not pleased at all with the quality.,32395,2
32396,the cup fit ok but the straps were so big and after adjusting them it was still too big.... after a while the strap broke so it was a waste.,32396,2
32397,Bought the 0-3 size and it looks more like 2T.,32397,2
32397,So huge.,32397,2
32397,It will eventually fit my daughter I am sure but not for the family photo session I speciffically bought this for when she is 1 month old.,32397,2
32398,they are too tall almost go to my belly button,32398,2
32399,Very thin material.,32399,2
32399,White on the inside of this colorful swimsuit.,32399,2
32399,Bottom portion fit ok but couldn't get arms in upper part.,32399,2
32399,"According to the size chart, XXL was suppose to fit.",32399,2
32399,I personally think it could have been better made.,32399,2
32400,"I returned this item, did not look anything like the picture and it was too small.",32400,2
32401,At first I loved this item because of the cute factor.,32401,2
32401,"However, it got dirty very quickly and no longer smells :(",32401,2
32402,does not fit apple watch bands properly,32402,2
32403,"The quality of this hoodie is actually pretty good, but my complaint is the sizing, I ordered a S, my usual size.",32403,2
32403,"I'm 5'6"" and 110 lbs, for me the sleeves are about 2-3"" too short, a little baggy in the waist.",32403,2
32403,"I would not get the light grey color, which I know is my mistake but it's just very plain.",32403,2
32403,"If you're shorter than me, it would probably fit better.",32403,2
32404,got it in January and fell in love at first sight.,32404,2
32404,i began using it every day.,32404,2
32404,but now its falling apart at the seams :( i love this bag but it didn't last long and it makes me super sad.,32404,2
32405,"cheaply made, not well designed.",32405,2
32406,VERY SMALL !,32406,2
32406,!!,32406,2
32406,Not as pictured at all.,32406,2
32407,"Too smal,not as advertised",32407,2
32408,My husband read other reviews that claimed to order the larger because the run small.,32408,2
32408,We ordered the med/large and got 3 to 6 month and they are too big for my 5 month.,32408,2
32408,I needed something to ensure that he would not take off and scratch his eczema skin.,32408,2
32408,We are back to the undependable socks because these fall off easy.,32408,2
32408,Sorry no ease of mind.,32408,2
32409,"I wear an ""H"" cup bra.",32409,2
32409,I sleep in XL tshirts be comfortable.,32409,2
32409,This particular XL was almost like wearing a child sized shirt.,32409,2
32410,Horrible quality.,32410,2
32410,"You can see the outlines of where the design on this shirt was pressed, AND mine arrived to me faded and peeling away.",32410,2
32410,Not impressed.,32410,2
32410,Promptly returned.,32410,2
32411,"Too tight in the chest and short, even in an XL.",32411,2
32411,The material isn't great either.,32411,2
32411,"It did the job in a pinch, but I wouldn't recommend it to others in general.",32411,2
32412,not too comfortable.,32412,2
32413,they were nice sandals but were way to narrow.,32413,2
32413,The strap came across an awkward place on my toes.,32413,2
32413,Very uncomfortable.,32413,2
32414,"Fair quality, poor fit on my 5'9"" 160 lb frame.",32414,2
32415,Way too small and is cheaply made.,32415,2
32416,It feels too big and too small at the same time.,32416,2
32416,The straps are loose and make the top look too large and the material is stiff and itchy on the skin.,32416,2
32416,I don't see this being comfortable on girls with big boobs.,32416,2
32417,The small was HUGE!,32417,2
32418,Have had the bracelet less than 2 weeks and the leather has pulled out of the clasp.,32418,2
32418,"The bracelet is pretty, but I would expect it to hold up better than that.",32418,2
32418,I have repaired it with glue and hopefully it will hold.,32418,2
32419,"Ordered large,so small my cat could wear it!",32419,2
32419,I loved it so much too!,32419,2
32419,Sadly returning.,32419,2
32420,not really liking this dress.,32420,2
32420,It's a bit bigger than I expected and has no shape.,32420,2
32420,Might look better on thin frames.,32420,2
32421,cheep material!,32421,2
32421,but ok for just hanging around the house,32421,2
32422,This runs very small and cheaply made.,32422,2
32423,Runs small.,32423,2
32423,I am a size 8 and the medium was way too small.,32423,2
32423,I probably could have used either the next size or bigger.,32423,2
32423,Couldn't return because the shipping would have been too expensive.,32423,2
32423,I contacted the company.,32423,2
32423,They gave me a $1.51 refund for my inconvenience.,32423,2
32423,I just have to give the shirt to someone smaller than me.,32423,2
32423,Cute design though.,32423,2
32424,*update just reviewed order and confirmed I ordered beige color but after looking at color options realized I received camel color not beige.,32424,2
32424,"Really cute hat, fit well.",32424,2
32424,"The color was odd I wish it weren't so bright, it has sort of an orange-y hue to it.",32424,2
32424,"I was hoping it would be a more neutral color, but it's still a nice hat.",32424,2
32424,"Fits great, snug enough to stay on but still has the bohemian kinda feel- in a good way.",32424,2
32424,I've had it for over a year now and it's held up really well- definitely a well made product with quality material and workmanship.,32424,2
32424,"I've washed it a bunch- way more than normal, and pleasantly surprised that it's help up so well and still looks so good.",32424,2
32424,"A bit of pilling now but honestly I'd expect it to look a lot worse, with the way it's made its not even noticeable though- which is awesome.",32424,2
32424,"The only downside for me was the color was a bit more vibrant than expected, which is why I left off two stars, but make no mistake- this is a really good quality product.",32424,2
32424,"I wanted a more neutral color, something I could wear with anything and this wasn't what is hoped.",32424,2
32424,I can still wear it with a lot of stuff but since the color is a bit bright I feel like it conflicts with some stuff.,32424,2
32425,HUGE!,32425,2
32425,my daughter is 2 and there is no way that they will fit her until she is like 5!,32425,2
32425,they are cute but just way too big.,32425,2
32426,"Considering I had purchased this as a gift for a female friend, I was very worried when I opened the box and could barely see the inscription.",32426,2
32426,"At first glance, the ring looks more like a gold wedding band than anything else.",32426,2
32426,"In the end, I gave it to her but made certain to tell her to look very carefully at it to ensure she didn't freak out.",32426,2
32426,"I also purchased another ring&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lureme-Engraved-Gold-Tone-Ring-Pendant-Chain-Necklace-for-Men-Women-Teen-Girls-A1000001/dp/B00U8ILHLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lureme Engraved Gold Tone Ring Pendant Chain Necklace for Men Women Teen Girls A1000001</a>, from a different listing/seller, that came with a necklace (that once was actually engraved and is much more like the one I expected this to be).",32426,2
32426,(BTW - The overall quality of the ring seems to be decent and that is why I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1).,32426,2
32427,Cute shirt but not made well at all!,32427,2
32428,"Loved the color, but it was so small.",32428,2
32428,I ordered an extra large and gave it to my daughter (who wears a small top and a 2 pant)....weighs 112#.,32428,2
32429,Skirt flares at bottom.,32429,2
32429,Should be tight.,32429,2
32430,Is not one size fits all.,32430,2
32430,It runs small.,32430,2
32431,All the designs were very unique and cute.,32431,2
32431,"However I only received 40 pcs, meaning they charged me for 50 pieces and shorted me 10 of those pieces.",32431,2
32431,The price isn't a problem but that is definetly an integrity issue.,32431,2
32432,Color was not represented well in the picture.,32432,2
32432,More of a poppy color NOT chili red,32432,2
32433,Very weird fit.,32433,2
32433,"If I was tie it around the neck to fit me, the ""V"" would have been close to my neck.",32433,2
32433,The length was fine.,32433,2
32433,Possibly would work for someone who has a larger chest??,32433,2
32433,"I am 5'4, 110 pounds.",32433,2
32433,Just a really weird fit.,32433,2
32434,This was cut terribly.,32434,2
32434,I couldn't get the arm hole past my forearm and my arms aren't that fat.,32434,2
32434,"The fabric is pretty and the quality is ok, there is just no way I can wear it.",32434,2
32435,The earrings can be sold cheaper than $149 I've paid for.,32435,2
32435,"The diamonf is low quality (as advertised), and is visibly yellow with imperfections.",32435,2
32436,Terrible under slip.,32436,2
32436,Hit me less than mid theigh and I have short legs.,32436,2
32436,I cut out the under slip and put a tulle skirt under it.,32436,2
32436,It's flat and boring otherwise.,32436,2
32436,I'm wearing an under cap T in photo for more coverage.,32436,2
32436,I went back and looked at the advertised photo and it's not even the same dress you can tell by looking at the bow and if you look closely at the fabric this is the cheap kind of lace in the other one look like a totally different kind of fabric.,32436,2
32437,Too thick wish they were not do dense,32437,2
32438,Runs small looks inexpensive.,32438,2
32438,I wouldn't advise anyone purchase .,32438,2
32438,"The material is not very nice , dress looks cheaply made .",32438,2
32438,The fit is very small and tight .,32438,2
32438,Save your money and try something else.,32438,2
32439,Small chain,32439,2
32440,I need it for a 20's party in September.,32440,2
32441,I'm usually a medium so I read the reviews before buying and I got a small.,32441,2
32441,Still too large.,32441,2
32441,The baby is still way down in the crotch area and it's very long and loose.,32441,2
32442,Too small not the size it says,32442,2
32443,the part were falling down as soon as i get it from the package.,32443,2
32443,"Also, i would put it in ""girls"" section , not for adult women:)
It, probably, will work as a top ( till all sequines falls:)...but i returned it",32443,2
32444,"This is a kids tie, and it does not list or state that in the ""description""",32444,2
32445,It is a cute dress - but it wasn't flattering on me so I sent it back.,32445,2
32445,Love Amazon Prime.,32445,2
32446,I tried the product on and the frabric ripped.,32446,2
32447,"Was listed as chiffon, but was not: half slip under skirt.",32447,2
32447,See through top,32447,2
32448,Nothing flattering about this at all.,32448,2
32448,It hit my arms just where the elbow fat collects and was so big that it actually made me look like a bigger girl than I really am.,32448,2
32448,"Also, it is very very very thin so there is no hiding behind it.",32448,2
32449,2 XL was length wise great somewhat narrow in chest and stomach but a keeper.,32449,2
32450,This took too long to arrive about two months!,32450,2
32450,Then it is a cheap quality.,32450,2
32450,Not worth what it cost.,32450,2
32451,"[Updated Review below]

[Original Review]
I like this belt.",32451,2
32451,I like it a lot.,32451,2
32451,"It's stylish, functional and easy to use.",32451,2
32451,I would like to make two suggestions though...,32451,2
32451,I generally like a shorter overlap.,32451,2
32451,"In order to make this happen, the ratchets could go closer to the end.",32451,2
32451,"In fact, why not make the entire ratchet area longer, which would give a longer functional range for the belt?",32451,2
32451,I also suggest adding a second gripping tooth to the buckle.,32451,2
32451,I suspect this would give a stronger grip and might prolong the life of the belt.,32451,2
32451,"That said though, I haven't had the belt slip, so this might not matter.",32451,2
32451,"[Review Updated 3/20/17]
The belt split over the weekend.",32451,2
32451,"The split was vertical, around where my back belt loop would be.",32451,2
32451,It went clean through the outer half of the belt.,32451,2
32451,"In 40+ years of owning belts, I have never had this happen, and it occurred after just over a year of ownership in this case.",32451,2
32451,I can no longer recommend this product.,32451,2
32452,It so little and it don't glow bright,32452,2
32453,Too small,32453,2
32454,I wear M but I order a size xL still to small,32454,2
32455,Cheap.,32455,2
32455,See thru.,32455,2
32455,If your not worried about that.,32455,2
32455,Buy it.,32455,2
32455,I did buy it in blue later and larger and still did not fit correctly.,32455,2
32455,Apparently im buying stuff that i will not wear.,32455,2
32455,I thought to take to tailor and have elastic put in waist but nevermind.,32455,2
32455,No more.,32455,2
32456,Skirt was huge!,32456,2
32456,I measured and everything.,32456,2
32456,it was also much longer than the picture.,32456,2
32457,The 2x was monstrous.,32457,2
32457,Atleast four sizes bigger than the measuring charts said.,32457,2
32458,They are stiff so the pink part feels like you're wearing cardboard.,32458,2
32458,"Also, they are huge.",32458,2
32459,These ran smaller and always seemed to slide down my butt!,32459,2
32459,The fabric along the seams got holes in it after 10-12 washes.,32459,2
32460,"I bought this jacket for a relative, I was very upset about the quality of the jacket.",32460,2
32460,"The material was very thin, if you hold it up to the light you can see through it.",32460,2
32460,The patch seems like someone ironed it on.,32460,2
32460,I guess this would be a good jacket for the spring.,32460,2
32461,doesn't look like the picture.,32461,2
32461,too big for a XS,32461,2
32462,Missing all important  belt.,32462,2
32462,Such a shame because it makes for a perfect resortwear bathing suit  cover up.,32462,2
32462,Now I will have to try to find a belt to match when all along I thought that was what I paid for.,32462,2
32463,"Love the design, The shirt is too big for a small.",32463,2
32464,A little big and to snug on the thighs for me.,32464,2
32465,Was disappointed it looks cheap.,32465,2
32465,Not at all like the photo.,32465,2
32466,I'm giving the shirt  2 stars due to the lower portion of the shirt being longer on one side than the other.,32466,2
32466,"I was ready for it to be slightly too big due to the listed measurements; however, I wasn't ready to have one side sitting lower than the other side.",32466,2
32467,cheap material,32467,2
32468,No good!,32468,2
32469,I bought two of these.,32469,2
32469,One for myself and one for someone else.,32469,2
32469,We bought or usual size and the sandals were too small.,32469,2
32469,Heels hanging out.,32469,2
32469,The quality is ok but the sandals look better in the picture.,32469,2
32470,"The tie under the bust was too tight, I couldn't even fit this over my head to put on!",32470,2
32470,I was very disappointed.,32470,2
32470,It should have been expandable in order to put on then tie tighter once on.,32470,2
32471,The fit and feel of the product are great.,32471,2
32471,I read the reviews and ordered a size up.,32471,2
32471,"However, the make of the product is poor.",32471,2
32471,Upon opening the package I noticed a hole in one of the sleeves and several hems were loose.,32471,2
32471,Just not worth sending it back.,32471,2
32472,Looks cheap,32472,2
32473,I was really excited about getting this dress.,32473,2
32473,But it looks like a crazy large sack.,32473,2
32473,Definitely size down a few from your normal dress size!,32473,2
32474,Nice swimsuit.,32474,2
32474,"However after washing it, it fell apart.",32474,2
32475,bought an x-large and it may as well have been an x-small (too small even for a teenager).,32475,2
32475,not beach appropriate but still able to use elsewhere,32475,2
32476,"The fit wasn't bad, but it looks cheaply made.",32476,2
32476,I wouldn't buy it again.,32476,2
32477,"Not effective at holding accidents, used these to train my son and every time he peed it soaked right through.",32477,2
32477,These are regular underwear but a ticket in the area like a pad.,32477,2
32477,"Don't recommend, might as well go commando or nothing at all.",32477,2
32478,"Good product for the price, what i expected in quality.",32478,2
32478,"Ordered mens large which was wayyyy to small, more like a childs large.",32478,2
32478,Definitely order atleast 2 sizes larger,32478,2
32479,Looking for a watch that didn't require battery changes every year or less.,32479,2
32479,"Watch has a really nice and professional/dressy look, which was a factor in my decision to order it.",32479,2
32479,I followed the instructions on starting the watch.,32479,2
32479,I set the time after winding and wore all day.,32479,2
32479,"At bed time, I noticed watch was about 15 minutes slow.",32479,2
32479,"Next morning, watch was wound, time set, and worn until late evening.",32479,2
32479,Noticed watch was about 20 minutes slow.,32479,2
32479,Next day found that overnite the watch would completely stop just a few hours after I took it off and went to sleep.,32479,2
32479,"I kept using the watch and going this process for a couple weeks hoping for improvement, but watch would pretty much continue to stop and/or lose time.",32479,2
32479,Wind never lasted a full day.,32479,2
32479,"After much dissappointment, was left with no choice but to return for refund.",32479,2
32480,"My man is 270 lbs, 6 ""1"", and this fit perfectly.",32480,2
32480,"However, it was disappointing because the print was smudged when we received it.",32480,2
32480,We could have gotten something better at the local print shop for a lot cheaper too.,32480,2
32480,We will not be returning it as it is not worth the money paid for shipping fees.,32480,2
32480,Just so you are aware.,32480,2
32480,You get what you pay for.,32480,2
32480,"Oh, and it takes 2/3 weeks to receive items on our end & if you are like me, please don't get your hopes up.",32480,2
32481,Not flattering for a short person.,32481,2
32481,"I am 5'2"".",32481,2
32482,I didn't like,32482,2
32483,Thought these would look and feel different.,32483,2
32483,Too girlish for me.,32483,2
32483,Definitely would not buy again.,32483,2
32483,Giving them away.,32483,2
32484,Has a funny smell like vinegar.,32484,2
32484,Couldn't get it off.,32484,2
32484,"Lovely look, but fits too small",32484,2
32485,"Literally a printed out sticker on a standard license frame, you could do it yourself.",32485,2
32485,Plus there was bubbling.,32485,2
32485,Not worth buying unless you're lazy to DIY.,32485,2
32486,"Case looks good, really slim and easy to put on and take off.",32486,2
32486,"Haven't tested it for water, I doubt it will pass...but it's ok I mainly wanted a case that is fully closed for sand, dust and can keep dry around water.",32486,2
32486,The front plastic cover is loose and it is really annoying when you use the touchpad.,32486,2
32486,I returned it but seller offered a new one.,32486,2
32486,I hope that would be more snug on the front!,32486,2
32487,This shirt seemed better in theory than in person.,32487,2
32487,"The point in the front is misaligned, so it looks funny on.",32487,2
32487,I think I'm going to have to alter the hemline before j can wear it.,32487,2
32487,The top lace is fun though.,32487,2
32488,When I ordered this shirt all the reviews stated it fit to size.,32488,2
32488,"I however decided I would order two sizes larger ""just in case"".",32488,2
32488,To say the least it did not fit.,32488,2
32488,I ordered a 2xl and it fit my 5 year old neighbor.,32488,2
32488,I will say the shirt appeared well made.,32488,2
32488,I hate that it was no where near fitting.,32488,2
32489,Does not lubricate well.,32489,2
32489,Would recommend metal.,32489,2
32489,These tore my ears.,32489,2
32490,Was super excited to get these sandals and reminisce about my childhood days wearing the checkerboard shoes every where I went.,32490,2
32490,"The first couple months were great, a little small but then they were worked in and fit fine and they look great.",32490,2
32490,But start of the third  month I noticed that the sandal started to fall apart at the bottom.,32490,2
32490,"The grip on the bottom started to completely separate from the sandal, really disappointed...",32490,2
32490,I love Vans products and want to order a new pair but figure it will just do the same thing... bummer,32490,2
32491,I found that this shirt was too large.,32491,2
32492,Shiny material.,32492,2
32492,Fits tighter than most larges that fit me.,32492,2
32493,I ordered an extra large.,32493,2
32493,The label says extra large but it fits like a regular.,32493,2
32493,Not even a large.,32493,2
32493,Very disappointing.,32493,2
32493,Especially after waiting so many weeks for delivery.,32493,2
32493,"Also, the leather is inferior, it's not genuine leather.",32493,2
32493,It looks like cheap leatherette.,32493,2
32494,normally,32494,2
32495,Decent quality but far smaller than advertised!!!,32495,2
32495,"Ordered men's XXXL and elastic waist is 32"", expanding at fullest to 41"".",32495,2
32496,"Well, not quite sure what I expected but what I ended up getting wasn't it.",32496,2
32496,"The sizing was right on the money, my husband did see a lift in my backside wearing these BUT...these have 2 major downsides that broke the deal for me.",32496,2
32496,"While the shaper is made from very strong, yet stretchable material there is a small section of (for decorative reasons maybe) lace material sown on to the bottom of the leg, in the front.",32496,2
32496,The lace has 0 stretch to it and was cutting into my thighs a bit.,32496,2
32496,The material being sturdy and stretchable as it is really does flatten your stomach.,32496,2
32496,Unfortunately it somehow pushes all the extra fat upwards so you have a nice bulge under your chest.,32496,2
32496,Not a good look.,32496,2
32496,"I am going to continue my search for a good shaper, probably one that has shoulder straps but let's me wear my own bra.",32496,2
32497,Shrank so much the first time I washed it that now the sleeves are too short.,32497,2
32497,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,32497,2
32498,I figured it would be 50/50 they would fit.,32498,2
32498,I could squeeze in them but I'd say they are ~size 4/5.,32498,2
32498,Gave a second star though because they did look as advertised.,32498,2
32499,I'm tall (5'10) but this literally fits like a shirt - not a cover-up.,32499,2
32500,I needed a dress for my baby shower and seen this was very cute and looked comfortable.,32500,2
32500,When I received the dress it was indeed comfortable but the fabric was too thin to wear to the party.,32500,2
32500,If it was made with a slightly thicker fabric it would have been perfect.,32500,2
32501,"Not only is there nowhere to put my boobs, it's very poorly made and inaccurate to the picture... *sigh* At least the top is removable to wear I can just buy a different bikini top and slide it through.. but really?",32501,2
32502,After reading the reviews on this I decided to order a size up.,32502,2
32502,I didn't look at the size on the label when I tried it on and when I put it on it was small.,32502,2
32502,I was sent a medium instead of an XL.,32502,2
32502,"That said, I usually wear a Large and I may keep the medium?",32502,2
32502,It is cute....would like a size up but need this for vacation that we leave for tomorrow so am thinking of just dealing with it being a bit tight on top (like a t-shirt).,32502,2
32502,You can see through it (in white) which I'm fine with for a cover up but wouldn't use this as a dress.,32502,2
32502,I would say this fits as expected.,32502,2
32502,UPDATE:  I wound up buying a large and had the medium which was sent in error.,32502,2
32502,I didn't see a difference between the two sizes and actually once I washed them they shrunk and sadly I am not able to use either (put in the donation bin).,32502,2
32502,The length doesn't bother me for a cover up (short but perfect for a cover up).,32502,2
32502,The fit is snug though and I was disappointed that I didn't see a difference in the fit with the different sizes.,32502,2
32503,"Interesting for the price; however, I ordered a M (I typically wear a S/M and size 6) and it was still way way way too small.",32503,2
32503,"I ended up returning it and not reordering, but if you can find the one that fits correctly it appeared to be well made and was good interesting material (not thin and cheap).",32503,2
32504,The led dint work shipped from China,32504,2
32505,Very cute and way too narrow so I returned them.,32505,2
32506,Took forever to be delivered - then was way too small,32506,2
32507,Really short shirt.,32507,2
32507,Won't even wear.,32507,2
32507,Bummer.,32507,2
32508,Arm length to short,32508,2
32509,The backpack itself is decent quality however the straps on the backpack were poorly stitched and after just one use one of the straps completely ripped off the bag.,32509,2
32509,The other two straps are hanging by threads and will come off after further use as well.,32509,2
32509,I really like the backpack but my son can't even use it anymore because of the faulty straps.,32509,2
32510,I bought a L blouse because in the reviews said that runs somewhat small (I am S-M)  and it was somewhat small again.,32510,2
32511,Fabric is super cheap.,32511,2
32511,The hat was way too big!,32511,2
32511,The fabric is so thin it's best for the summer.,32511,2
32511,I wasn't happy with the material but my son looked cute in it.,32511,2
32511,I dodnt think it would would up in the wash but it did.,32511,2
32512,"Material MUCH different than expected, cheaper looking",32512,2
32513,Looks cheap.,32513,2
32513,Get what you pay for.,32513,2
32514,"Only open half way down..
NOT ALL THE WAY AS ADVERTISED.",32514,2
32514,Still too difficulto put on 2yo.,32514,2
32514,Returned and bought a cheap pair of knit ones instead and these work fine for this year.,32514,2
32515,"These don't fold, so they take a lot of room - do not fit well in a pocket.",32515,2
32515,"fit is not secure, slides off ears toward the back of my head.",32515,2
32515,These are cheap knock-offs - Spend the money for the original and you'll be happier.,32515,2
32516,Beautiful dress but make sure it's what you want.,32516,2
32516,For health reason the dress does not work .,32516,2
32516,Looked into sending it back so from USA to China it is a good $50 dollars.,32516,2
32517,Not quite as pictured... Has very cheap lining and is measurements are significantly smaller than sizing chart would suggest.,32517,2
32517,"I am a 5'5"" an 8/10 and ordered an XL and it is VERY snug.",32517,2
32518,strange color,32518,2
32519,Very cute; very thin.,32519,2
32520,Tarnished very quickly.,32520,2
32520,Costume jewelry only,32520,2
32521,"Charging port went bad, would charge.",32521,2
32521,Had to wiggle the cord to try and charge it.,32521,2
32521,Cheap junk.,32521,2
32522,really wrinkly,32522,2
32523,The material is not named and it does not breathe very well.,32523,2
32523,It is uncomfortable.,32523,2
32524,"It looked like a cute blazer with a very pretty lining, but the small was tight across the shoulders.",32524,2
32524,"I'm 5/4"", way about 124 on a good day and usually wear a size 6.",32524,2
32524,More importantly the pockets are fake and I needed a blazer with pockets.,32524,2
32524,I wish they would have clarified that on the details.,32524,2
32525,"Originally, when I received this product in the maiI was satisfied with the quality.",32525,2
32525,I thought the plastic piece was a little too long considering the size of most belly button piercings.,32525,2
32525,I wore it for a day and the bottom pierce/charm fell completely off so I returned for a refund.,32525,2
32526,"I received this dress, ironed it and wore it out one night.",32526,2
32526,I loved it and received so many compliments!,32526,2
32526,It was just adorable.,32526,2
32526,Definitely a five star cute summer dress.,32526,2
32526,"Then, I washed it, cold water, gentle cycle, and hung it to dry, as I do all my dresses..... And it shrunk 1-2 sizes.",32526,2
32526,It now fits like a glove.,32526,2
32526,"Hey, at least I got one wear out of it",32526,2
32527,It fits a bit funny in that it hangs oddly on the shoulders.,32527,2
32527,In the end I could not wear it because it's too short.,32527,2
32527,"I'm 6'2"" and usually wear XL in all other clothes.",32527,2
32527,That is what I ordered.,32527,2
32528,It's a nice top.,32528,2
32528,"However, the picture makes it look like it's a tunic which is what I preferred.",32528,2
32528,"Unfortunately, it's like a regular shirt.",32528,2
32529,I think I got this for $6.,32529,2
32529,Its honestly already falling apart.,32529,2
32530,I purchased this garment to use under a  sheer midi dress that I like.,32530,2
32530,"According to the sizing chart there should have been a little more wiggly room, MEH.",32530,2
32530,This dress is a body hugger/clinger and might work for someone who has the figure to pull it off.,32530,2
32530,"Every body bump, muffin top and bra fat will be enhanced in this dress.",32530,2
32530,The dress does not work for me.,32530,2
32531,Ordered these twice and received the wrong pattern both times.,32531,2
32531,"They felt soft, so I really wish they would have sent the correct ones.",32531,2
32531,Decided not to take the risk of receiving the wrong pattern for the 3rd time.,32531,2
32532,This is definitely not as pictured.,32532,2
32532,The top of this perfume bottle is painted in a sloppy yellow and the stopper is crooked.,32532,2
32532,I ordered three and they were all the same.,32532,2
32532,I'm very disappointed.,32532,2
32532,The photo is a misrepresentation of actual item.,32532,2
32533,Blade is much too thick for most of my watches.,32533,2
32533,"However, handle is very well made metal.",32533,2
32534,Not what I expected.,32534,2
32535,"I was happy with the fit of this product and the style of it, but I was sent a completely different pattern than the one shown in the photograph.",32535,2
32536,I liked the shirt but it was too small,32536,2
32537,Cute but bra cups are very small,32537,2
32538,Please buy at least 2 sizes up.,32538,2
32538,This is not spandex and will not stretch to give the fitted feel.,32538,2
32538,I am in the process of returning.,32538,2
32539,On the small size,32539,2
32540,Very cute but very small and hard to read.,32540,2
32540,I don't have too much to say about this headband because it arrived broken and I could not wear it.,32540,2
32541,"Cheap material almost tissue thin, undersized, ill fitting.",32541,2
32542,"They looked so nice, but they did not fit at all!",32542,2
32542,I have a 36 inch waist and I even ordered a xl to accommodate for the reviews on them since alot of people were saying they didn't fit as expected.,32542,2
32543,Fits great I did my body measurement and it said get a XXL and it fits awesome!,32543,2
32543,"I'm 5,0 210Lb and love the flow of the shirt!",32543,2
32543,Also downfall of this tho is once you wash it shrinks like crazy!,32543,2
32543,I can no longer wear it!,32543,2
32544,"fabric is very thin, can see where different color threads were used through out sweater

sleeves are LONG - way past my hands, even way long on hubby.",32544,2
32544,"Style is nice and had high hopes for it, but it is not worth it at all

Also, side seams are noticeably crooked :(

I cannot recommend this product",32544,2
32545,The chest area does not support anything,32545,2
32546,Came with 2 rips and a hole in the lining!,32546,2
32546,"Pretty pants, poor quality!",32546,2
32547,I went by the responses of other people that have bought this before and used the sizing guide and this thing still is way too small.,32547,2
32547,you cant even button it since the front part is too small if you do you have these big stretched gaps in between buttons that just totally cancell out any sexy you have going on in them.,32547,2
32547,"They were so cheap im not going to waste the time sending them back,but if you do buy this,i would seriously go by the chart  for sizing and then go up an additional size.",32547,2
32547,"Actually,just don't buy them.",32547,2
32548,"It was separated at the shoulder pulled away like someone tried on and it has to be mended in order to wear, I may just return it.",32548,2
32548,Will send photo later,32548,2
32549,cheaply made.,32549,2
32549,I actually gave it away.,32549,2
32549,Never wore it,32549,2
32550,Only unpacked the unit to check for watchband fit.,32550,2
32550,The box is nicely made and solid with a rich look to it.,32550,2
32550,A bit on the large size for a single unit.,32550,2
32550,"However, even with the enclosed adapter for smaller wrist band lengths it will not hold my metal-link band of my Rado watch.",32550,2
32550,"The watch holder spring device places too much pressure on the metal link locking mechanism and pops open on my 6"" long watchband when released.",32550,2
32550,The watch holding mechanism is also awkward to use.,32550,2
32550,There are 3 spring-loaded holders that require pressing on 3 place simultaneously to mount the watch and lock it.,32550,2
32550,Returned it same day...,32550,2
32551,The fit was way to big for size indicated.,32551,2
32551,It also had a very musty smell.,32551,2
32552,way to big,32552,2
32553,could barely see the dog paws and wording,32553,2
32554,"Cute design, very cheaply made top.",32554,2
32554,"Unless you are very thin and live where it is very hot, I would not buy it.",32554,2
32554,Will probably give it away.,32554,2
32554,"Too bad, really like the image on it.",32554,2
32555,"I didn't like how this costume was all one piece, more of a dress style.",32555,2
32555,"The skirt part was constantly riding up, I had to wear shorts underneath.",32555,2
32556,I loved the concept of the skirt but it fit way too large for me.,32556,2
32557,"Ordered accoring to the chart... Large for a Woman might as well be a Small, its insane how small this is.",32557,2
32558,"I got this skirt because it was heavily discounted and looked cute, but I was disappointed when it arrived.",32558,2
32558,The material felt rough and was too form-fitting.,32558,2
32558,The lace is pretty but that didn't make up for the uncomfortable fit.,32558,2
32558,I returned it.,32558,2
32559,My niece loves it,32559,2
32560,I really don't like the chain it came with and the clasp wouldn't stay closed so it kept opening and the ball kept dropping out but I bit the clasp so now it stays closed.,32560,2
32560,Clasp isn't that big a deal to me.,32560,2
32560,I gave such low stars because the chain was so cheap and I didn't like the appearance of the chain.,32560,2
32560,Its a little cheap looking overall but I still love that it comes with three different color balls.,32560,2
32561,Bathing suit was a little small.,32561,2
32561,The color is completely different than the picture.,32561,2
32561,It's more of a pumpkin orange.,32561,2
32561,"The material is awful very thick foam type material, not what I was expecting.",32561,2
32562,It's a beautiful necklace.,32562,2
32562,But the color fades real quick.,32562,2
32562,I wore it 3x by the third use the color started to fade and the paint started to chip and looked black,32562,2
32563,very pretty BUT... very very small.,32563,2
32563,i did order a M - my mistake- but i normally get my size with  this type of suit and fits perfectly.,32563,2
32563,NOT this suit!,32563,2
32563,aside from being a bit short it seems to be narrow around the chest area and i foresee showing way too much breast.,32563,2
32563,it is pretty though so buy large or be very small,32563,2
32564,I plugged in my size.,32564,2
32564,Wasn't sized right.,32564,2
32565,Start falling apart as soon as I got it.,32565,2
32565,barely use it for photos and the piece that holding the fan together broke within matter of hrs!!!,32565,2
32565,not worth the price,32565,2
32566,"soft material, the cat is crappy, it feels like it's gunna fall off, I'm afraid to wear it because of having the cat fall off.",32566,2
32566,do not recommend,32566,2
32567,They Material is very stretchy.,32567,2
32567,"Not a fan of it, but I still wear it occasionally.",32567,2
32567,It fits as expected tho.,32567,2
32568,I wear a woman's 8-10 so I thought getting the 8-10 would be exactly what I needed.,32568,2
32568,Boy was I wrong.,32568,2
32568,The top is embarrassingly small so i'm not posting a picture of it.,32568,2
32568,"The bottoms weren't as bad, but the material used doesn't seem like actual bathing suit material, more like legging material, so I can't attest to it being used in the pool or at the beach since like I said earlier it's kind of embarrassing all together.",32568,2
32568,The ONLY redeeming quality is the Union Jack cover up.,32568,2
32568,It's a very soft material and is pretty large.,32568,2
32568,"I got this with the intent to use the top and cover up with a cosplay so I can at least still use the cover up, but I'll probably end up donating the suit to one of my smaller chested friends.",32568,2
32569,it is too limp.,32569,2
32570,too loose!,32570,2
32571,Wore blisters on side of her foot.,32571,2
32572,Bottom fit but not the top.,32572,2
32572,Top looks nothing like the picture.,32572,2
32573,I bought these based on the great reviews.,32573,2
32573,Unfortunately I did not have the same good experience.,32573,2
32573,My daughter only wore these two or three times and each time she got sores on her ankles where the metal buckles rubbed.,32573,2
32573,"Also, they fir her a little awkwardly, with too much space in the back of the shoe but her foot nearly hung off of the front.",32573,2
32573,I tried to adjust the straps but that didn't seem to make any difference.,32573,2
32573,"I will say the quality of the materials were very good and they are simply adorable, I'm just disappointed that I spent the extra money to purchase these over other less expensive sandals in hope these would become her ""go to"" shoes for the summer.",32573,2
32574,I think these are just little try outs to see if they should sell in the store it's cute but 4.something is great for the price if you want to experience to fix it up,32574,2
32575,"Okay, so I'm 5'7 and about 120lbs and I was so excited to see how cheap these socks were!",32575,2
32575,"They came in good time and the material was quite thin, but they barely went over my knees and were so tight that they left red marks after I took them off.",32575,2
32575,I returned them and am quite disappointed.,32575,2
32575,I will not be buying from them again.,32575,2
32576,Way too small...,32576,2
32576,I would order again a size up but i'm afraid that that'll be too small too.,32576,2
32577,I love the color and material.,32577,2
32577,But I ordered an XL and it fits like an XS,32577,2
32578,There was missing stones and brads on the handbag.,32578,2
32578,I returned it.,32578,2
32579,"Shipping took forever, however this was initially disclosed, so I can't complain too much.",32579,2
32579,"Unfortunately, the clasp broke 2 days after I got it.",32579,2
32579,"As a result, I lost it, having only worn it once.",32579,2
32579,Whoever picked it up...I hope they enjoy it more than I did.,32579,2
32580,The length of these sandals are ok but but are much too wide for my feet.,32580,2
32580,If they weren't so wide they woul be ok.,32580,2
32581,"I am 5'7"" and wear a size 4 and thus dress didn't go over my butt, and the arms were not long enough :( so sad.",32581,2
32581,Back to square one looking for a wedding dress!,32581,2
32581,"I expected it to not be amazing quality because of the price, but the edges were not finished on half the dress which is odd to me.",32581,2
32581,"Definitely a good fair quality dress if you're not looking for a wedding dress, but order a size or 2 up :)",32581,2
32582,"Bottom too small, tight",32582,2
32583,"The hair tie fits on the bracelet, but will not stay on.",32583,2
32583,The grooves are not deep enough for the hair tie to stay in place.,32583,2
32583,The bracelets are cute and can be worn without the hair tie.,32583,2
32583,Although disappointed that it didn't work the way it was supposed to I am keeping the bracelets anyways.,32583,2
32584,Soft material.,32584,2
32584,True to size at present.,32584,2
32584,Just received it so unsure if it will shrink after a wash.,32584,2
32584,"It is annoying that I got 3 pink, 3 blue, 2 Orange, green and greenish- blue.",32584,2
32584,No basic colors included in my package.,32584,2
32584,Almost feels like someone packed all the unsold colors in one and sold it.,32584,2
32584,If you are looking for something with basic colors and different colors would not recommend it.,32584,2
32585,"Too small in the arms, while being too low cut in the front.",32585,2
32586,It fit my baby's head but not my own.,32586,2
32586,I have lots of long hair but I don't have a big head so this wig was too small for me.,32586,2
32587,Too big.,32587,2
32587,Cheaply made.,32587,2
32587,I have much cheaper sunglasses that are way better.,32587,2
32588,very poor quality,32588,2
32589,This dress is ill fitting.,32589,2
32589,There is no room for breasts!,32589,2
32589,I wear a size 10 and I ordered the size they recommended but the breast part is much too small.,32589,2
32589,The dress does not look like the picture.,32589,2
32589,If you have breasts....don't buy this dress!,32589,2
32590,I loved it the first time but the plastic part of the strap broke and it shank after washing it.,32590,2
32591,This coat is really cute HOWEVER I had no idea it was going to be SUPER small and lightweight.,32591,2
32591,Despite the pictures the size of this coat is more for kids.,32591,2
32592,"The quality of the product is very good; however, the red color pictured in the choices is not what I received.",32592,2
32592,The hat I received is a cranberry red and not the fire engine red shown in the picture.,32592,2
32592,I was very disappointed.,32592,2
32592,"The hat won't match my gloves or neck scarf, but I'll wear it anyway :-(",32592,2
32593,Really cute but about 3 sizes too small.,32593,2
32594,Way to small,32594,2
32595,really really big in the legs,32595,2
32596,ordered an XL and I usually wear a medium.,32596,2
32596,Ended up giving it to my 7 year old.,32596,2
32597,Sizing is way off order up 3 sizes larger if you plan on fitting it,32597,2
32598,Have the Chrysmela Catch which is twice the amount but purchased this product since it was made in USA and most reviews were good.,32598,2
32598,"I found these did NOT lock on post nor heard/felt it ""click"" in place.",32598,2
32598,This item was returned for refund.,32598,2
32598,Very disappointed.,32598,2
32599,Very see through,32599,2
32600,"The body of the shirt fits, but the arms are to big.",32600,2
32600,WTF??,32600,2
32600,?,32600,2
32601,"not comfy at all, weird fit",32601,2
32602,These are not opera-length gloves!,32602,2
32602,Item description and photos are wrong.,32602,2
32602,The gloves stop just before the elbow.,32602,2
32602,The leather is nice.,32602,2
32602,Gloves are a bit snug -- consider sizing up.,32602,2
32603,This broke within the first few days of having it.,32603,2
32603,Cheaply made.,32603,2
32604,The product fit too small and could not return for a refund,32604,2
32605,Had to return because they fit small plus not 100% polyester its a 80% polyester and 20% spandex.,32605,2
32606,It wasn't in the best shape it could be,32606,2
32607,"The suit was torn when I received it,so I had to just hold it up to my body it looked as if I we're to put it on it would be a swimsuit!",32607,2
32607,"It arrived on time but the deleivery person took it to the wrong hs,luckily my daughter was outside to I inquire on the pkge and get it back.",32607,2
32608,"It looks nice, feels super soft and I can stretch in it.",32608,2
32608,"However, it slides down when I stand up or walk so I can't use them for dancing.",32608,2
32609,"Super cute in the picture, but when I received this top it had a very unpleasant smell to it..",32609,2
32609,Comparable to a strong burnt plastic like odor.,32609,2
32609,"I washed it twice, but i could still smell it faintly.",32609,2
32609,It made my arms itch due to the material.,32609,2
32609,The lace had loose ends which I trimmed.,32609,2
32609,"Overall, poor quality, but you get what you pay for.",32609,2
32610,The  shirt is  big the arms are tiny and tight it's not  worth what I paid for it,32610,2
32611,"After ordering a pair in a different color that was great, I ordered this pair.",32611,2
32611,I did not take them out of the package until the night needed.,32611,2
32611,"When I did, I noticed a large hole in one of the legs.",32611,2
32611,"I will be more careful, if I decide to order again.",32611,2
32612,Sad because its to way to big,32612,2
32613,Way to small.,32613,2
32613,Sent back and received credit within a couple of days.,32613,2
32614,It's too small.,32614,2
32614,I recommend getting one size bigger,32614,2
32615,"Apparently, it had the sizes listed somewhere, but not very obviously.",32615,2
32615,WAYYY too small for a normal male.,32615,2
32615,"My daughter really like them, though.",32615,2
32615,Too bad they don't have normal peoples' sizes.,32615,2
32616,"Even tho I ordered my regular size, this shirt is too small.",32616,2
32617,Shrunk a lot,32617,2
32618,The pocketbook is way too big.,32618,2
32618,And the leather is too stiff,32618,2
32619,states that it zips from bottom  but it zips from top  halo zips from bottom  you have to unzip it all the way to change diaper,32619,2
32620,"It is as cute in person as the photo and looked to be good quality fabric, however I have to return it because it is way too small.",32620,2
32620,"I'm 5'7"" and bought a large.",32620,2
32620,"It fit around, but looks like it may be designed for petite women.",32620,2
32620,"The arms were way to tight, I could barely get the sleeves in the right place on my arm and was very constricting, the yellow part rode up my bust, and the skirt barely covered my bum instead of being a few inches above the knee.",32620,2
32620,"I was very disappointed, because otherwise this would've been a great nursing dress and very discrete.",32620,2
32621,The chain keeping it together broke not two hours after wearing it for the first time.,32621,2
32621,"All I was doing was grocery shopping and it couldn't hold up to that D:
It's sad too because the product itself looks very pretty",32621,2
32622,I am usually a small but ordered a medium and that was too small,32622,2
32623,Runs extremely small.,32623,2
32623,I have not been able to wear it yet.,32623,2
32623,I probably should have returned it but didn't.,32623,2
32624,"White parts of the fabric is slightly see-through, so nipples are visible through the suit!!",32624,2
32624,"Too small if you're taller (I'm 5'7"" with a longer than average torso).",32624,2
32624,"The leg holes are not high rise like in the photo, but full bottom coverage (which I ended up preferring).",32624,2
32624,"Fortunately I only bought this for a costume, so it's not a big deal, but this is unwearable as a swimsuit.",32624,2
32625,This is very cheaply made.,32625,2
32625,"The fabric is of a nice weight, soft,  and a pretty baby blue.",32625,2
32625,But the stitching and thread are very cheap.,32625,2
32625,"There are loose threads in many places, which look horrible.",32625,2
32625,"All stitching is done in white thread,  which I don't think looks too good either.",32625,2
32625,The shirt itself fits large.,32625,2
32625,"I knew it would be more shirt sized based on other reviews,  but I didn't expect the chest to be so loose.",32625,2
32625,I would not order again.,32625,2
32625,"For reference,  I am 5'3'' and 130 lbs, and I ordered a small.",32625,2
32626,Color off more pink than orenge,32626,2
32627,One of the coin like dagle was detached while i got this.,32627,2
32627,It might be easily fixable but i have open the package for that which I didn't intend to.,32627,2
32627,Since it was a gift.,32627,2
32627,Otherwise it looks pretty.,32627,2
32628,"The socks are great, but the non slip bubbles on the bottoms are NOT.",32628,2
32629,I wasn't a fan of these.,32629,2
32629,"I was hoping I could wear them and get away with looking like I was wearing grey pants instead of something as comfortable as pajamas, but they don't look all that great.",32629,2
32629,They are also not very flattering on size-14-me.,32629,2
32630,Expected it to fit a little bigger but it's tight and shorter than expected,32630,2
32631,Not as good of a quality that I had hoped for.,32631,2
32631,Size ran smaller.,32631,2
32632,Very cheap fabrics and the lace was coming apart at the seams.,32632,2
32632,But an adorable idea!,32632,2
32633,Uk sizing,32633,2
32634,"Not as cute in person, returned",32634,2
32635,Cheap look and feel,32635,2
32636,i ordered a medium and when I tried it on yes bottom part was so small I could barely walk in it.,32636,2
32636,Before I could get it off it ripped.,32636,2
32636,It's a gorgeous dress just cheaply made.,32636,2
32637,Kind of flimsy and won't stay on.,32637,2
32637,They look good.,32637,2
32638,Kindda expensive for what you get,32638,2
32639,I ordered the black one in xxl to fit my hips (about 45-46 inches) and I knew the top wouldn't fit me at all (which kind of sucks because I'm wasting a top).,32639,2
32639,"The waist band fits perfectly fine, however the leg openings are way too small.",32639,2
32639,"The quality seems good, but the sizing is a little off.",32639,2
32639,I wish I was also able to purchase a smaller top size (I'm a 36b) but I guess it doesn't matter because I'm returning it back due to the small leg opening.,32639,2
32640,Very thin material that shows your nips.,32640,2
32640,You have to wear a bathing suit bra because there is no padding.,32640,2
32640,Cute fit and covers well but needs padding on top.,32640,2
32641,I bought this for me originally but it was way too big.,32641,2
32641,I purchased a 1X but this shirt fit like a 3X.,32641,2
32642,Very tight fitting.,32642,2
32642,If you have any chest it will not fit yoy,32642,2
32643,I ordered an XL and it fits more like a medium or small.,32643,2
32644,It's just OK.,32644,2
32644,"If you have any kind of boobs, they will not fit into the top.",32644,2
32644,There is simply a flat panel where the girls belong but no 'pocket' for them to rest in.,32644,2
32644,Thus the seam under the embroidery goes straight across the middle of the breasts.,32644,2
32644,So this is basically a smock type nightgown with no flattery or sexiness at all.,32644,2
32644,Straps are very thin and slip down my shoulders all the time.,32644,2
32644,Color is pretty.,32644,2
32645,"Nice bag, just a little too floppy for my taste.",32645,2
32645,The bag has no structure.,32645,2
32645,"If you put something heavy in it, like a camera it will sag in the middle.",32645,2
32645,In my opinion its only good for clothing.,32645,2
32646,It's a good quality for the price however if you have curve I absolutely do not at all recommend.,32646,2
32646,"Perhaps if you are petite and straight, small chest very little bottom you could fit in size that's 2x your size.",32646,2
32646,Just so happens I'm a large with room usually.,32646,2
32646,It was for that no luck at all.,32646,2
32646,My friends a medium and she had no luck either.,32646,2
32646,Our other friend is a small with minimal curve and it just fits.,32646,2
32647,Material looks cheap,32647,2
32648,Faux Jean print s awful and cheap looking,32648,2
32649,Ordered a large.,32649,2
32649,I'm 170 and it's tight all over.,32649,2
32649,It's really cute.,32649,2
32649,Too bad it didn't fit.,32649,2
32649,Came early though,32649,2
32650,This bra gets two stars because at least it's beautiful.,32650,2
32650,But how am I supposed to fit into this?,32650,2
32650,It's so tiny!,32650,2
32650,"Waaayyy too small, in both the cup size and the band size.",32650,2
32650,"If you really want this bra, order a size (or sizes) up.",32650,2
32651,Broke the first time I wore it.,32651,2
32652,"This is sturdy, well made and it does stretch shoes.",32652,2
32652,"The problem is that my foot is not shaped like a ""typical"" shoe -- that's the whole problem.",32652,2
32652,"This device stretches (only the width) of a ""typical"" shoe.",32652,2
32652,"So, it does help a little, but it can't make my shoes actually fit my foot.",32652,2
32652,I've tried stuffing different sized objects into the toe and using the stretcher to apply pressure to them.,32652,2
32652,Almost works.,32652,2
32652,"What I really needed was a device that allowed me to stretch whatever dimension I needed, with a last (technical term) shaped like my own anatomy, or enough adjustments so I could make the device do what I needed.",32652,2
32652,"If you have a ""model"" foot that just needs more width, this thing will probably do what you need.",32652,2
32653,The quality isn't good and its too large,32653,2
32654,"Item is good and fit perfectly the only big problem with it is that the color description said burgundy but is completely red not burgundy at all, so please make shure when you order that you look at the review.",32654,2
32655,"You get what you pay for, and I thought this jewelry looked cheap.",32655,2
32655,I ended up donating it to the thrift shop.,32655,2
32656,"Full bodied but about 10"" in diameter.",32656,2
32656,Not impressed for 25.00 and 7.00 shipping,32656,2
32657,Does not fit.,32657,2
32658,The fit could  have been better,32658,2
32659,I had to return these adorable sandals.,32659,2
32659,One strap on the rt.,32659,2
32659,"shoe was over 1/2"" too long and could not be shortened by the shoe shop without damaging the shoe bed.",32659,2
32659,Very disappointing as I adored the style and color.,32659,2
32659,The straps would have needed to have been shortened in the back which was possible but it was not possible to split the sole of the shoe to accommodate a repair for the thong which was much too long.,32659,2
32659,"Was told they are all likely sized the same way as shoes, like dresses, tops, etc.",32659,2
32659,are cut from a pattern.,32659,2
32659,Ordered another style and was sad that these did not work.,32659,2
32659,Micki Simms,32659,2
32660,The slots for credit cards are too small.,32660,2
32660,It also has strong smell that I could never get past.,32660,2
32660,"IT is a good color and light weight, but I couldn't use it.",32660,2
32661,Beautiful but lousy material.,32661,2
32662,Fabric is thin.,32662,2
32663,Does not fit like the model.,32663,2
32663,She must be one of those size 0 Chinese models,32663,2
32664,"The product was way to small (I wear a small/med in US sizes: these are Asian sizes, so keep that in mind) and I had it exchanged for a larger size, which was still way to small.",32664,2
32664,"Thesessweatshirts are not very accommidating in the chest area, if you are larger than a small B. I did have a great response with exchanging it, they were very nice and willing to exchange and work with me when the second shirt didn't fit.",32664,2
32664,They gave me a full refund after realizing that I couldn't make their product fit on my chest.,32664,2
32664,I would give their customer service high marks!,32664,2
32665,these slippers are flimsy and they are too big.,32665,2
32665,i normally wear a 7.5 and ordered a 7.5 and they are too big.,32665,2
32665,i would say they are about an 8 or 8.5 maybe,32665,2
32666,"The case is nice and it's the right size, but I don't think that it is actually real leather.",32666,2
32667,not the same shape as picture.,32667,2
32668,I got Medium which is the size that I normally get but they were small,32668,2
32669,Pretty but really really small.,32669,2
32670,This jacket zipped up looks more like a band uniform than it does an Assassins Creed Jacket.,32670,2
32670,"Need more pictures of it done up, the sleeves and the way the back is done up.",32670,2
32670,Design issue: The two outer zippers should go together to complete the look.,32670,2
32670,As it is right now the only thing that screams Assassins Creed is the horn on the hood.,32670,2
32671,I am 5'3 1/2.,32671,2
32671,"My measurements are: 33, 32, 42.",32671,2
32671,I'm 150 pounds and have too kids.,32671,2
32671,I have a pretty athletic body with curves at my lower half.,32671,2
32671,After ready reviews I chose this pink one in a medium.,32671,2
32671,It was wayyyy too short on the torso and tight everywhere.,32671,2
32671,The color was too pink like a little girls bathing suit.,32671,2
32671,The ties at the bottom needed to be cut by the buyer but I didn't cut it because I am returning it.,32671,2
32671,It wasn't even that stretchy.,32671,2
32671,Felt stuffed in it.,32671,2
32671,My lady part felt really squished.,32671,2
32671,Wouldn't recommend unless you're tiny and have a short torso.,32671,2
32671,My husband likes everything on me but he said this wasn't flattering.,32671,2
32671,Overall the tightness was uncomfortable.,32671,2
32671,Maybe a size up will be better if it wasn't for the short torso and pink color.,32671,2
32672,The nightgown is NOT true to size.,32672,2
32672,Ran small and I'm usually a Medium.,32672,2
32673,Very cute design and look just like the picture BUT way to small.,32673,2
32673,I ordered a large based on reviews but still way too small.,32673,2
32673,Not for a girl with hips and but.,32673,2
32673,I'll just give it to my little niece.,32673,2
32674,Fabric feels cheap and the lace around the neck is so uncomfortable I took it off after 2 mins.,32674,2
32674,Bought this for a Vegas trip and left it in my closet.,32674,2
32675,"I'm disappointed because there's no give or stretch in the shirt, the arms are too small, and the length doesn't go past my hips and I thought this was going to be a long shirt as pictured.",32675,2
32675,I ordered a large I usually wear a medium  but I ordered a large and it fits like a small.,32675,2
32675,I gave it two stars  instead of one because I like the colors in the shirt.,32675,2

32676,"I love the magnet catch, the size and the design...however the chain is not good so I switched that to a cord and I thought all was well.",32676,2
32676,This morning I got another email from the seller asking for a review so I looked closely at my locket and saw that the finish was wearing off front and back and it is changing color.,32676,2
32676,I have been wearing this for exactly 7 days.,32676,2
32676,"I never have jewelry change color on me, so I don't know what is going on with this.",32676,2
32677,Cheaply made,32677,2
32678,"I hate to complain because it is so inexpensive, but you have to lace it up yourself.",32678,2
32678,It isn't a very easy process either.,32678,2
32678,Took me a good hour only to have to make adjustments later which took at least another hour.,32678,2
32679,The shoulders are to small!,32679,2
32680,Not exactly the length I expected!,32680,2
32680,Good for short legged girls.,32680,2
32681,This dress looks like one of my slips that goes under a sheer dress...not fit to wear as an actual dress.,32681,2
32682,VERY CHEAP-LOOKING.,32682,2
32683,"Cut too low and the lace is not ""one size"".",32683,2
32683,"I'm not a big gal, usually M in VS and these fit a bit snug",32683,2

32692,I will not purchase this again,32692,2
32693,"I loved these socks at first, but after two washes they got big holes in he big toe and heel.",32693,2
32693,It was every sock in the same place which leads me to believe it's a manufacturing issue.,32693,2
32693,Update: I received an e-mail from the company apologizing and offering to send me new socks.,32693,2
32693,They said it must have been a mix up at the factory and some defective socks were sent out to me.,32693,2
32693,I'll update again if the new socks are of better quality.,32693,2
32693,I expect they will be.,32693,2

32695,Easy to pop back in but you know..,32695,2
32695,Pretty shoddy.,32695,2
32695,"These are now my backup sunglasses, shoved aside in my car somewhere.",32695,2

32698,The fit was great however the style fell short for me.,32698,2
32698,The yellow on the sleeve wasn't quite as appealing in person.,32698,2
32699,To large and some were to long and the croch hung down more then they should of need to send them back !,32699,2

32703,Very pretty!,32703,2
32703,But too small,32703,2
32704,really cheap materials to be 70 dollars .,32704,2
32704,I opened the box and already the thin aluminum had light scratches imagine after a week in my pocket.,32704,2
32704,Also the plastic was sliding everywhere when I tested pulling it out of my pocket.,32704,2
32704,I put it right back into the box and returned it .,32704,2
32705,I read the reviews and ordered according to the size chart that was a mistake.,32705,2
32705,"I have a 38 waist, ordered a 3xl and it's way too big.",32705,2
32705,"I could comfortably go straight to the third set of hooks, no compression.",32705,2

32705,Bad buy.,32705,2
32706,I followed the size guidelines.,32706,2

32707,I wear a small and it fits me.,32707,2
32708,"Disproportional fit at the shoulders, I'm 5,4, it feels like the dress is made for someone 6ft tall, maybe if you buy size(s) smaller it would fit ok.",32708,2
32708,"Fabric is stretchy, almost costumy, no lining, donated it.",32708,2
32709,It made me look huge.,32709,2
32709,Material is very slinky and thin.,32709,2
32709,Would look great on someone who is very tall and skinny but that's about it.,32709,2
32709,Made and shipped from China so I didn't bother paying to return it,32709,2
32710,Too small had to return,32710,2
32711,beyond short.,32711,2
32711,"I'm 5'8"", which I realize is a little bit on the taller side, but it barely covered my coochy while standing straight!",32711,2
32711,I ended up cutting off the bottom and now it's a super cute top!,32711,2
32712,That it was too small,32712,2
32713,lots of 'straggler' threads,32713,2
32714,Ordered size 12 month and it's sized on the tag as 6-12 months but still too small for a 16lb 5 month old causing red indentions in is thighs.,32714,2
32715,"The belt looks great but the clasp is made of cheap aluminum, it broke a month after purchase.",32715,2
32716,These are made of poor quality.,32716,2

32719,"I'm 5' 1"" and weigh 117lbs.",32719,2
32719,"And it's missing the bottom snap, not worth the money.",32719,2

32723,"I bought this for holding all of our important travel documents for airfare, a hotel stay, transportation arrangements and a cruise.",32723,2
32723,I left it at home because it was a lot smaller than I needed.,32723,2
32723,"It will not hold any standard 8x10 printouts unless you fold them multiple times, which is not really helpful.",32723,2
32723,I wound up using a manila folder instead.,32723,2
32724,Doesn't fit American girls!,32724,2
32724,Tiny...hard to stretch (more like nylon than lycra).,32724,2
32724,Really cute product but need bigger sizes1,32724,2
32725,"Buyer beware - just because you ordered the right waist size, that's not the only measurement that really counts - my waist fit when arrived was perfect - but my stuff was falling out all over.",32725,2
32725,If your stuff is even slightly above average these won't fit.,32725,2
32725,Bummer too - cool colors and cool design.,32725,2
32726,The arms are very small and the red is much brighter than expected.,32726,2
32726,I would have preferred a much deeper red.,32726,2
32726,The length is ridiculously long.,32726,2
32726,The hem will probably rip the first time I wear it.,32726,2
32726,I'm 5'3,32726,2
32727,"Very disappointed in how this fit 
No boob support
Not made for tall ladies",32727,2
32728,The sweatshirt is very comfortable and fits well but the Wonder Woman is barely noticeable.,32728,2
32728,In the picture on Amazon she's dark black.,32728,2
32728,On my actual sweatshirt she's a hardly noticeable outline of white.,32728,2
32728,Not sure it printed correctly.,32728,2
32728,Kids sad.,32728,2
32729,"Was a shorter maxi dress, looked like it was flooding on me.",32729,2
32730,Not real impressed with the quality.,32730,2
32731,Very thin the top did not support at all.,32731,2
32731,But I do like the bottoms.,32731,2
32732,The backstrap stretched out so the flip flops wouldn't stay on my daughter's feet.,32732,2
32732,I ended up returning them.,32732,2
32732,Too bad because the pattern is super cute and my daughter liked them a lot... until they wouldn't stay on her feet.,32732,2
32733,"Heavy frames, more for men, not what I expected.",32733,2
32734,"Loved the style, however it is not durable.",32734,2
32734,Thread came out at waist after first wear.,32734,2
32734,Had a lot of room but cheap material or poor workmanship.,32734,2
32734,I will have to sew it up.,32734,2
32735,style did not look good on me,32735,2
32736,Dress is very see through.,32736,2
32736,But super cute and comfy just need to buy a slip to go under now,32736,2
32737,Super cute but way to small I had to return it because I couldn't even clasp it.,32737,2
32737,If it was a bit wider I would absolutely love it.,32737,2
32738,very poor quality,32738,2
32739,Doesn't look cute in person or at all like the picture.,32739,2
32739,"The color I got was not navy but a weird medium dusty blue, which, when combined with the cut and shape of the shirt (also not quite like the photo) looked just like I was wearing belted medical scrubs.",32739,2
32739,"By following other reviews which said to size way up, I did end up with the right size, it just doesn't resemble the ad.",32739,2
32740,Cute design but think it's made for more petite women.,32740,2
32740,Was not long enough in the Torso.,32740,2
32740,I'm 5-8 and found my normal size was not big enough to compensate for this.,32740,2
32740,If I had gone with a larger size however would have been too loose.,32740,2
32741,Size,32741,2
32742,"Better for a toddler, doesn't work on the new born.",32742,2
32742,The toddler loves them though.,32742,2
32743,Wire sucks and runs to small.,32743,2
32743,If you have think thighs don't buy.,32743,2
32744,I have three pairs of this type of shoe in the name brand and love them.,32744,2
32744,so I was happy to see these at a much lower price - until I put them on.,32744,2
32744,When I first put them on I was disappointed and thinking they were too small because the fabric at the front crushed my toes like when you wear tights with boots and a couple of times during the day you have to remove your boots to pull the toe of the tights off your toes.,32744,2
32744,This wasn't quite as bad as that but it was uncomfortable.,32744,2
32744,"When I looked closer, the sole was sticking out from the back of my heel by a generous half inch and when I pulled the shoe forwards so my heel was at the back the fit was perfect.",32744,2
32744,"Until I picked my foot up off the floor and the stretchy upper pulled the shoe backwards again, crushing my toes and leaving the empty half inch of sole sticking out the back.",32744,2
32744,"I have pretty standard feet, 7.5 to an 8, medium width, nothing weird.",32744,2
32744,So I have to assume that these are just made incorrectly.,32744,2
32744,A pity because I like the design but I will never wear them.,32744,2
32745,So disappointed.,32745,2
32745,"I was expecting it to be pretty loose because I'm usually an xs but not only was it gigantic, the way it was cut made it difficult to imagine it would work even if I were larger.",32745,2
32746,Smaller than I thought but it sits loose on my nose.,32746,2
32746,I don't think that ill be wearing them.,32746,2
32747,Colors faded really bad from first wash.,32747,2
32748,"Okay, I liked this necklace fine.",32748,2
32748,It wasn't the statement piece I expected but you get what you pay for.,32748,2
32748,What I regret about this purchase is HOW MANY TIMES THIS COMPANY EMAILED ME.,32748,2
32748,I purchased this necklace MONTHS ago and they have literally emailed me everyday asking for a review.,32748,2
32748,You get a low review for harassing someone to get what you want for higher sales.,32748,2
32748,Annoying - RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS.,32748,2
32748,Ugh.,32748,2
32749,"The garment was not what I expected, it was poor quality.",32749,2
32749,"I would not recommend
this item for purchase.",32749,2
32749,Thanks but no thanks.,32749,2
32750,Claims to be 14K but it infected my girlfriends ear.,32750,2
32750,I specifically bought them because she was NOT allergic to gold but there must be some other cheap metals mixed in.,32750,2
32750,Look nice so they do not get a 1-star but the product was a let down from what I was expecting.,32750,2
32751,Not at all as expected.,32751,2
32751,Looks cheap and not like other homeyee dresses I bought.,32751,2
32751,It is teal and not green as advertised.,32751,2
32751,I will be returning it.,32751,2
32752,I'm 5'6 and around 130 pounds.,32752,2
32752,"I don't really have boobs, so I ordered a small.",32752,2
32752,"The top fits well, but the cups in the top are SO cheap feeling.",32752,2
32752,Very round.,32752,2
32752,The bottoms are very tiny.,32752,2
32752,"If you're not a plank, & want both to fit... Good luck.",32752,2
32753,"Came HALF MADE
On one side the design matched the photo and the other did was poorly stitched and didn't match.",32753,2
32753,Other than that the fitting and the length was as expected but it's not worth anymore than the price given.,32753,2
32754,"The hat is a decent size, however it is warped pretty badly.",32754,2
32754,The left side of the bill hangs alot lower than the right and the symbol skews off to one side as well.,32754,2
32755,Pricey thought they would be nicer especially since I had to purchase them separately to get 2 handles.,32755,2
32755,Thought they would be longer and the loop to hold the tail down was secured with a bare staple kindof tacky looking,32755,2
32756,Came broken.,32756,2
32757,"Don't order this product, I ordered it expecting a Mitchell and Ness spanback, but instead got a child's new Era hat.",32757,2
32757,"It's small and different colrs, very dissapointed",32757,2
32758,They arrived I tried them on ordered the 5 pack had the red one on within 10 minutes the red zipper pulled apart fit comfortable other than the zippers because I am a 40 d they would not hold together but I know from experience plastic zippers are terrible I don't know why they did away with metal zippers no matter what metal zipper over plastic will hold together,32758,2
32759,Cap was not of the quality I expected.,32759,2
32759,"I thought the shape of the cap, except the bill was not very good.",32759,2
32760,I love this belt.,32760,2
32760,Its comfy and it keeps my pants up.,32760,2
32760,The only issue I have is I ordered grey and I got a grayish hunter green color although I didn't really mind.,32760,2
32760,Great product .,32760,2
32760,Update 1 month.,32760,2
32760,Belt is starting to tear up the stitching near where the belt goes back through itself.,32760,2
32760,Thankfully it's canvas and I know how to stitch it back up,32760,2
32761,Not well made.,32761,2
32761,The ball that locks in the belt fell off after 3 weeks.,32761,2
32762,I was so excited to find this tank!,32762,2
32762,But I'm bummed to report there is a flaw in the screen print that fills the negative space of the gun with white ink - it's like the gun is censored.,32762,2
32762,"You can not tell what she is holding, since it blends in with her face.",32762,2
32762,"I'll still wear it since voting day is tomorrow, I'm just disappointed.",32762,2
32762,I see the same flaw on another poster's review photo too... bummer!,32762,2
32763,The dress is too small,32763,2
32764,The coats thick and warm.,32764,2
32764,However the zipper is sooo sharp for a baby coat its not ideal i bought a scarf to help cover his chin to keep the zipper away from his face.,32764,2
32764,Really scary how cheap and sharp that zipper is spend the extra money and get a carters jacket at least uou can carry your baby and not be worried hes going to end up with scratches all over him from the zipper.,32764,2
32765,I liked the color.,32765,2
32765,I am 5.7 ft .,32765,2
32765,tall.,32765,2
32765,But its almost 3 inch above ankle.,32765,2
32765,Also the pleats are not symmetrical.,32765,2
32766,This was too short for me.,32766,2
32767,the top cream part is see-through.,32767,2
32768,"I ordered at least 5 Grace Karin vintage dresses, returning two as it turned out too large for me.",32768,2
32768,Fabric may need ironing.,32768,2
32768,"Loose on the top, shoulders, chest, arms, and waist line.",32768,2
32768,I ordered a small and it is still too large :(  Returning two keeping three.,32768,2
32769,Patch was sewn too close to the edge of the velcro.,32769,2
32769,Patch seperated from velcro due to the border seam.,32769,2
32769,"Loved the patch, hated the fact that I had to send it back, as it separated the first time i removed it.",32769,2
32770,It's a very cute suit.,32770,2
32770,True to size in my opinion (But I am a small).,32770,2
32770,The only problem is that the top and bottom are very see through.,32770,2
32770,"I would not wear this suit in public, let alone in the water.",32770,2
32770,"It's too bad, it was a cute suit that fit well and was flattering.",32770,2
32771,I recieved this about 2 weeks early so i gave a 2 .,32771,2
32771,It was stuffed in a box 2 times 2 small.,32771,2
32771,Hat was all bent up.,32771,2
32771,Poor stitching on parts of it.,32771,2
32771,I have learned that cheaper is not always the best way to go cause you get what u pay for......,32771,2
32772,So I take a Large in Nike brand - ordered a XXL to be safe - WAY TOO SMALL!,32772,2
32772,My 16 year old daughter is a small to med and it fits her perfectly.,32772,2
32772,She says they are very comfortable.,32772,2
32773,I couldn't wear it as pretty as it was but disappointing that it was smaller than what the size chart predicted.,32773,2
32773,"I bought two different sizes, one for me one for my 8yr old.",32773,2
32773,She couldn't fit hers but could fit mine so there it is I gave her mine and we just hv an extra one waiting to see who we can give it away too,32773,2
32774,"It broke the first day I wore it, it was cute though.",32774,2
32775,"The arch is a  too high for me, my foot slid off the outside of the shoe.",32775,2
32776,"Cheaply made and tarnished a couple weeks after purchasing, but I didn't expect much for the price.",32776,2
32777,Shincy,32777,2
32778,"I bought this against my better judgement, and it had the exact problems I expected it to.",32778,2
32778,"I was hoping the ruching would help conceal a lower tummy bulge, but the fabric is so clingy that it doesn't do much.",32778,2
32778,"The fabric is also very thin--If panty lines bother you, avoid this skirt.",32778,2
32779,I was able to get a group picture with them on.,32779,2
32779,Right when I bent down to get something they ripped..,32779,2
32780,These run very very small.,32780,2
32780,I gave them to my daughter who is a size 6.,32780,2
32780,I ordered an XXL.,32780,2
32780,Straps a little big but fix her great everywhere else.,32780,2
32781,Too small and material too thin,32781,2
32782,It felt like a drape.,32782,2
32782,The slip underneath was too short.,32782,2
32782,Gave it to my daughter.,32782,2
32782,She says it's OK for a cover up.,32782,2
32783,Neck is huge.,32783,2
32784,"I'm 5'1 and 100 pounds, I got the medium.",32784,2
32784,It is definitely different from the picture.,32784,2
32784,The pant part goes down way longer than in the pic if looks more like capris than shorts.,32784,2
32784,also to baggy.,32784,2
32784,not impressed,32784,2
32785,rubber band on sides are too tight.,32785,2
32786,Very poor quality,32786,2
32787,"The Large, despite the sizing chart saying it would fit a U.S. size 14, did not fit as such.",32787,2
32787,"Granted, i am tall, @5'10"".",32787,2
32787,It was not long enough in the torso so exchanged for an XL.,32787,2
32787,It fit the exact same way.,32787,2
32787,Not happy i had to pay shipping to return an item that was supposed to be bigger but didn't fit ANY bigger.,32787,2
32788,Poor quality fabric.,32788,2
32788,Weird boxy cut.,32788,2
32788,Unflattering neckline.,32788,2
32788,Overall disappointed in this product.,32788,2
32788,I'll keep it as a hang around the house dress.,32788,2
32788,Don't recommend.,32788,2
32789,"I like them, but I gave them two stars because it's supposed to fit up to size 12 and I'm a size 10 and they barely fit me.",32789,2
32789,I'm leaving for a cruise tomorrow so I'm going to have to use them as I don't have time to send them back.,32789,2
32789,Very disappointing that the sizing is not correct.,32789,2
32790,Good quality but wayyy too small for my daughter to wear for skiing.,32790,2
32790,Its more for toddlers,32790,2
32791,Cute style but seemed like it was stretched out when I received it.,32791,2
32791,Almost fit like a M/L.,32791,2
32792,Too tight,32792,2
32793,It was to leave for me.,32793,2
32793,My criquing husband didn't like it at all.,32793,2
32793,"Stating, that outfit is not 'YOU'.",32793,2
32793,"It makes you look bigger than you are, which I do agree.",32793,2
32794,Wanted to try them at the house before taking them ice fishing.,32794,2
32794,Its a good thing I tested them first because they don't work.,32794,2
32794,I have tried two different sets of new batteries with the same results.,32794,2
32794,For the price it was worth a try.,32794,2
32794,I still gave it two stars because the socks them self are warm.,32794,2
32795,The medium top fit but the bottoms were tiny so I reordered suit in a large to wear the medium top with large bottoms.,32795,2
32795,The large bottoms had to be taken in but now everything fits.,32795,2
32795,I'm 5'2 and usually wear a size 2.,32795,2
32796,Does not fit well.,32796,2
32796,Bottom a lot smaller than described.,32796,2
32797,Not flattering on me.,32797,2
32797,I'm slim everywhere except on the midsection.,32797,2
32797,It made me look huge.,32797,2
32798,The actual garment that I received is half the length that your picture indicates.,32798,2
32798,Very misleading unfortunately.,32798,2
32799,Had to return this - the strap was broken when it arrived.,32799,2
32799,Did not re-order another one - the quality was bad.,32799,2
32799,Giving this 2 stars because returning/refund was quick and easy.,32799,2
32800,to big,32800,2
32801,runs small,32801,2
32802,After a month or two the words start to cut up and fall off.,32802,2
32803,Quality was not that good.,32803,2
32803,But nice shirt overall.,32803,2
32804,"doesn't really look like the pic but still cute and got the job done, definitely underwear made just to be taken off.",32804,2
32804,material is rough and scratchy so not something you wanna wear under a dress all date night long.,32804,2
32805,"Not the right size, too big!",32805,2
32806,This is poorly made!,32806,2
32806,I don't know what's going on with the sleeves -- they're sewn on like puff sleeves at the shoulders and quite ridiculous looking.,32806,2
32806,I won't wear it :(,32806,2
32807,I was looking forward to taking this dress on vercation with me.,32807,2
32807,It is very cheered.,32807,2
32807,Not as nice as it looks in the picture.,32807,2
32807,Poor quality.,32807,2
32808,"The customers service is great, shipped fast, but the posts themselves are so small they're nearly impossible to use as ear studs.",32808,2
32808,Might work on very thin earlobes...,32808,2
32809,The bottom fits to small the top fits better.,32809,2
32810,I love the design but the reason I gave it two stars is because it broke as soon as I took it out of the package.,32810,2
32810,"It comes with a set of two, so I was still able to wear one for the event I bought it for but that broke when I was I clasping it to take it off after the first time wearing it.",32810,2
32810,"So this is great for one time use, just not if you plan to wear it longer.",32810,2
32811,Coating was a bit abrasive for my tastes.,32811,2
32811,Didn't feel like something I was comfortable inserting into my body.,32811,2
32812,The measurements were too small on the product I order.,32812,2
32813,I wear these to sleep in.,32813,2
32813,"I like that they're padded, but without wire underneath they don't keep anything ""up"".",32813,2
32814,I bought this for my dad.,32814,2
32814,He wears size 8 but it was somehow a tinny bitty small on him.,32814,2
32814,"But, overall its okay looking.",32814,2
32815,I sent it Back because it was bigger Han the picture indicate.,32815,2
32816,Cute outfit but was put together weird.,32816,2
32817,My boyfriend said it looks boxy on me.,32817,2
32817,It was very awkward to put on and take off as you  have to slip it on and then try to get your arms in each hole while the material is not stretchy.,32817,2
32817,"If you are a very narrow thin body shape, I can see this being attractive on.",32817,2
32817,My measurements are 39 -30-40 and I am a b/c cup.,32817,2
32817,If you have a wider rib cage and shoulders than the average Asian lady I would highly recommend you find something else.,32817,2
32818,Way too small ~ tried on the same pair at the store and they fit.,32818,2
32818,These didn't.,32818,2
32818,"These are also the same price at the outlet.. Usually
I get a great deal for shopping Amazon but not the case here.",32818,2
32819,"I usually take a small but I ordered a medium, it does not fit correctly and is misshaped.",32819,2
32819,Short on the bottom of the shirt.,32819,2
32819,I will have to wear a long shirt underneath it.,32819,2
32820,"First off, I ordered this with the intentions of wearing this transformer dress from VonVonni for a wedding I am apart off in September.",32820,2
32820,"While I received this dress by the expected delivery date [thanks to Amazon Prime], that was the only good thing about this online purchase.",32820,2
32820,"I ordered the Gold Metallic VonVonni Women's Transformer Dress, not the gold with the animal print, just the regular one.",32820,2
32820,The description of Gold Metallic with the picture of the gold metallic dress was nothing like the product that was sent to me.,32820,2
32820,There's nothing shimmery gold or gold metallic about the dress I received.,32820,2
32820,The dress I received was more of a champagne color and small gold glitter.,32820,2
32820,"It didn't look nice when I opened the bag it was sent in, but I tried it on hoping it'd look decent on.",32820,2
32820,"Unfortunately, it wasn't even decent looking when I tried it on.",32820,2
32820,"I'm a size US 4 or EU8 in most brands and even I found this to be way to big for me, I don't know how anyone smaller me (like a size 2 and smaller) could work with this dress especially when this dress is meant for anyone that are within the size range of 0-12 (one size fits all).",32820,2
32820,I'm most disappointed about the color of the dress not being what the description on the webpage states it to be.,32820,2
32820,"I'm also unhappy with how they cut part of the dress too, if you've read the other reviews about this types of dress from VonVonni good or bad, you figure that the dress not hemmed at all, which is understandable seeing this dress is suppose to be convertible, however parts of the dress I received was cut so badly that you could see wear they stopped and started a new cut in the fabric (very sloppy looking).",32820,2
32820,"Due to those issues, I sent the dress back indubitably to VonVonni, I did not like the dress VonVonni sent me.",32820,2
32820,"Although I've only had negative things to say about the dress I received, I can honestly say that the actually fabric felt nice (had good weight to it, jersey-like material) and was decent for the price they charge.",32820,2
32820,I don't believe that this dress is nice in the lighter colors (like the one I ended up getting) because of the fabric there's a risk of it being see through and/or you will be able to see any flaws in craftsmanship if any.,32820,2
32820,But I think the dress could be worn beautifully in the darker colors and the brighter colors options (flaws will be less noticeable and the fabric would look better in those types of colors).,32820,2
32820,"Wished that this dress was in the right gold metallic color and better crafted, I could have saved money, however I'll look elsewhere and spend more for quality.",32820,2
32821,Cartoon is an iron on patch of low quality.,32821,2
32821,"Ordered a women's large, fits like a women's small.",32821,2
32821,Passed on to smaller kid.,32821,2
32822,"I thought this was going to be a towel or tapestry/canvas material, but it's more of a round this polyester-ish scarf.",32822,2
32822,"Pretty design, though.",32822,2
32823,Poorly made...,32823,2
32823,Very cheap looking,32823,2
32824,"the panties are pretty enough and fit as expected however, the cotton crotch area is too small and makes them uncomfortable.",32824,2
32825,"Reguarding the texture and quality of the tights, I would buy more than one pair but the sizing for me is very off!",32825,2
32825,"I'm about 5' 2"" 240 pounds and I could not get these past my hips with out possibly ripping them.",32825,2
32826,Paper like shirt but cute ...,32826,2
32827,Not a good material.,32827,2
32827,And medium was to small.,32827,2
32828,It looks dirty and used and feels cheap.,32828,2
32829,I wear a small and ordered a medium and it was still too small.,32829,2
32829,Also feels like when I wash it a couple of times will entirely fall apart....but what do you expect for $3?,32829,2
32830,It is very flimsy and soft.,32830,2
32830,"doesn't look like a cowboy hat at all, actually it looks like a fedora!!",32830,2
32830,"Not like any Stetson ""Cowboy Hat"" I have owned.",32830,2
32830,The picture is very deceiving and the description is vague.,32830,2
32830,"Don't recommend this hat, it is not shapeable either.",32830,2
32830,Not worth the money.,32830,2
32831,The bodysuit was too large and had a few holes in it before I even tried it on,32831,2
32832,Was very disappointed.,32832,2
32832,I wish I read the reviews before purchasing.,32832,2
32832,The material is horrible.,32832,2
32832,I hope when I wash it it shrinks down a little.,32832,2
32833,"Product was too small, and the fabric does not move with your body.",32833,2
32834,Quality of material is not that great,32834,2
32835,"Too hard to close the clasp for me , sorry",32835,2
32836,"First dress damaged, then the second one arrived wrinkley.",32836,2
32836,I love how the dress fits and looks though.,32836,2
32837,"First, I'd like to say that the green is a beautiful deep shade of teal.",32837,2
32837,It's a beautiful color that would take you through all seasons.,32837,2
32837,BUT...,32837,2
32837,"I was expecting real animal leather per item description, and I would feel comfortable wagering that this is not.",32837,2
32837,It has a synthetic smell and the graining texture is too uniform.,32837,2
32837,Therefore I strongly suspect PU leather although there is no labeling I could find on wallet or box that said anything at all about materials.,32837,2
32837,There was also smudging of dye and faint black smudges around the edges of where weaving meets the edges of wallet.,32837,2
32837,The weaving is on both sides of the wallet.,32837,2
32837,"Bottom line: If you buy this expecting synthetic leather and mall boutique quality for fashion forward styling, you'll be happy.",32837,2
32837,"If you buy expecting true leather and craftsmanship, you'll want to search for something else.",32837,2
32837,Back it goes.,32837,2
32838,It cuts into my back and it doesn't fit right.,32838,2
32838,I can't wear it.,32838,2
32839,Was not what I expected maybe it runs small,32839,2
32840,"Button holes way too small for the buttons, so i just took them off alltogether.",32840,2
32840,Pink is also NOT PINK.,32840,2
32840,Its a peach.,32840,2
32840,And now doesnt match anything in my wardrobe :/,32840,2
32841,"Need a size larger, ordered based on sizing chart and bottom is too tight and feels like I'm cutting into my neck tying the straps to hold to suit up on my chest in the right place",32841,2
32842,"It was way too small for me and I'm 5'4, 115 pounds.",32842,2
32842,There is not much fabric covering you up so be forewarned.,32842,2
32842,It may fit somebody smaller than me with a top size smaller than an A cup.,32842,2
32843,small,32843,2
32844,The bottoms were great but the top was incredibly small!,32844,2
32844,It's for basically a B cup and should not be labeled large!,32844,2
32845,"Shows to be for long torso, but is not",32845,2
32846,The design is awesome.,32846,2
32846,My girl friend is upset though that they came with 2 big scratches and a big crack right out the box.,32846,2
32847,Zipper stopped working after 3 weeks.,32847,2
32847,Going to cost $50 to replace!,32847,2
32848,The quality of this top is quite poor.,32848,2
32848,I read a lot of good reviews but I did not feel the same about the top I received.,32848,2
32848,"I ordered the color ""kahki"" but what arrived was a pinky-flesh color & is very unattractive.",32848,2
32848,The lining under the lace is a very pool quality fabric & is kind of shiny & doesn't match the lace so it is very noticeable when wearing this garment.,32848,2
32848,Perhaps it looks better in one of the other color options.,32848,2
32848,I am disappointed in this top...wearing it once to get my money's worth but will be donating it to charity soon.,32848,2
32849,Don't bother.... Cheaply made and dies not hang well.,32849,2
32849,Material is very thin the buttons seem like they are going to fall off.,32849,2
32849,Will probably just use as a bathing suit cover up.,32849,2
32850,bad quality!,32850,2
32851,"This skirt was the right length that I like, however some don't like when their skirt hits the floor I however do.",32851,2
32851,"This is NOT a roll down skirt, where you can adjust the length kind of by folding over top.",32851,2
32851,The fit is strange and makes you look hippier than you are if you pull it up to where the line is not in an awkward spot.,32851,2
32851,If you try pulling it down so the line is lower the skirt is dragging all over the ground .,32851,2
32851,Also i ordered my normal size and fit is a little big.,32851,2
32851,I might wear around the house but that's as far as it's going to go..disappointed.,32851,2
32852,Mine is upside down  And looks more like a butterfly but I'm still wearing it.,32852,2
32853,It is to small for a 3xl I gave it to my sister who wears a small to medium...she fits it just right.,32853,2
32853,:(,32853,2
32854,"This shirt is basically just a large T-shirt, not a maternity shirt.",32854,2
32854,It's short and way too big.,32854,2
32854,"If you're under 5'1"", this shirt may fit you properly if you are overweight before pregnancy.",32854,2
32854,I gave it two stars because the only cute part about this shirt is the baby peeking out.,32854,2
32854,The material is so cheap I don't think it's worth paying to have it altered... ugh...,32854,2
32855,It was cute but the top was to small for me and I'm size 34D,32855,2
32856,The round parts of the conversion pendants are too bulky to hide and tend to make the pin/pendant protrude in an unnatural and crooked kind of way.,32856,2
32856,I will try again with another pin but I doubt that it will be better.,32856,2
32856,"Unless the pin is large and clunky, it would be hard to hide these things.",32856,2
32856,"I think that if you have very large pins, these might work but I'm not happy with them at all!",32856,2
32856,!,32856,2
32857,It's definitely not made for a 'real ' woman's figure .,32857,2
32858,It is nicely designed but really in bad quality - pilling everywhere after only a FEW HOUR wearing.,32858,2
32858,Not suggest to buy.,32858,2
32859,"I'm not very busty for my size, but I couldn't fit into the top at all.",32859,2
32859,Smashed me like a pancake.,32859,2
32859,Ha!,32859,2
32859,I'm a 16-18 with a DD bust and it just wasn't happening.,32859,2
32859,I don't remember what size I ordered and my invoice isn't showing it either so I can't help you there.,32859,2
32859,Sorry!,32859,2
32859,I left for vacation and didn't get a chance to send it back.,32859,2
32860,Too small.,32860,2
32861,"Good enough for the night, chain broke as i tried to put it on, lucky for me, it broke close to the end so i could still make it work.",32861,2
32862,Good quality but had to return product...too small.,32862,2
32863,It was too small,32863,2
32864,"if you get it wet once for a second forget about it,( I hopped in the shower, realized it, took it off that second but it tarnished immediately) I was bummed, for a costume it would be good for one night the price was cheap but this is made of the material that you get jewelry out of the twenty five cent machines at the grocery stores.",32864,2
32864,If your skin is that type that turns green due to costume jewelry I definitely wouldn't recommend.,32864,2
32865,Not bad for the price but the color on the bottom of the band started to rub off within the first week.,32865,2
32865,Still looks very good but it won't last long.,32865,2
32865,Still not bad for the price.,32865,2
32866,My bracelet broke the same day i wore it but im trying to get it fix.,32866,2
32867,"Ok skull cap hat but not a ""slouch hat"" as advertised.",32867,2
32868,I like it!,32868,2
32868,it's definitely small though... im a little bit curvy and so its a bit snug.,32868,2
32868,the material is also reallythin and its basically see through (though others cannot really tell.,32868,2
32868,"the colors are not what they look like in the advertisement photos, they are darker.",32868,2
32868,im usually a medium but i got a large and im so glad that i did.,32868,2
32868,"if you are built like i am, its probably not a good choice for you.",32868,2
32868,it almost didn't even fit me.,32868,2
32868,im lucky it did,32868,2
32869,The top doesn't fit well at all.,32869,2
32869,Covers in the wrong places.,32869,2
32869,Top is also too big for me while the bottoms are way too small.,32869,2
32869,It gets 2 stars for being here before as expected and I might be able to wear the bottoms...maybe.,32869,2
32870,"First of all, when I opened the mailing envelope, I found that I had only one package of ""Snuggues"".",32870,2
32870,"Secondly, installing them is a pain in the posterior.",32870,2
32870,"I finally immersed one in boiling water for 30 seconds, and found it pliable enough to work with.",32870,2
32870,To say that I'm not too pleased is an understatement.,32870,2
32870,Thanks for asking!,32870,2
32871,"Although the bra fits nicely, the bra was advertised as push up and there was no padding.",32871,2
32872,It was too large so I gave it away.,32872,2
32873,Luckily I bought this for a friend with their money.,32873,2
32873,I thought it only deserved one star but friend said three so I am herin giving it two stars.,32873,2
32873,Friend found it just satisfactory while I say it was terrible quality.,32873,2
32874,The product looked in great condition.,32874,2
32874,I have a small frame but I have broad shoulders and big breasts.,32874,2
32874,That's why I usually get size 6 bathing suits.,32874,2
32874,This one didn't fit right.,32874,2
32874,The thorzo was a little too long.,32874,2
32874,It didn't look right.,32874,2
32875,I didn't expect much from a $15 watch but the least I was expecting was to be able to read it when I'm looking at it it's readable when your angle of view is exactly perpendicular to the watch but if it's tilted slightly above 20 degrees there is no way you can read it all you se is 8888888888i I will attach some pictures,32875,2
32876,It did not meet my expectations!,32876,2
32876,It's not what I was looking for.,32876,2
32876,"Material is good, the color was perfect but it does not fit the way I wanted too.",32876,2
32876,The lace is too long and the opening was not long enough.,32876,2
32877,had to give it to my 12 yr old daughter.,32877,2
32877,Im 5'3 125 lbs and it fit like a crop top?,32877,2
32877,did not come below the waist more than 2 inches and VERY tight in the torso.,32877,2
32877,I bought the Large.,32877,2
32877,I guess its a large in childrens sizes.,32877,2
32877,Also it was very thin.,32877,2
32877,Not like a sweat shirt at all.,32877,2
32878,Awful costume fit...,32878,2
32879,Not made well,32879,2
32880,Tarnishes after one wear,32880,2
32881,The fabric is not linen.,32881,2
32881,It is a very sheer gauzy type.,32881,2
32881,I purchased the white and it cannot be worn without a tank top.,32881,2
32881,The fit is very strange around the arms and across the chest.,32881,2
32881,I am a typical 8-10 and the cut is just weird.,32881,2
32881,I cannot wear it,32881,2
32882,"Cute bag, but the smell is overwhelming.",32882,2
32882,I bought this on a deep discount day on a risk since the reviews were mixed.,32882,2
32882,The bag itself is very very cute and a wonderful size for me as a mom.,32882,2
32882,However the chemical smell is terrible.,32882,2
32882,I've had it airing out for over a week and the smell has not diminished at all.,32882,2
32882,I'm not sure if the bag will be usable since the smell doesn't seem to be going away.,32882,2
32883,Way too small but it's cute,32883,2
32884,Love the look and fit- but the material is terrible and very cheap looking.,32884,2
32885,The clasp broke on it after wearing it for a little while.,32885,2
32886,I typically wear an american large.,32886,2
32886,Ordered XL in this shirt and fits maybe like a children's large.,32886,2
32886,"The quality of the top is fantastic, but don't even bother unless ordering for a child.",32886,2
32887,I don't understand why everything on Amazon coming from China has to be made so impossibly tiny.,32887,2
32887,"I'm 5'5, 112lbs--most small sized women's clothing is slightly too large for me.",32887,2
32887,The two rompers I ordered from Choies in size small were skin tight and riding up my butt.,32887,2
32887,How can any adult woman fit into these clothes?,32887,2
32887,"If anything, these should be marked as XS and mediums should be smalls.",32887,2
32887,Not even worth trying to size up because they're so cheaply made.,32887,2
32887,Just go to Forever21 and pay 5 dollars more--at least sizing will be more consistent..,32887,2
32888,Got rusty and disgust,32888,2
32889,"Cute product, great idea but obviously not made for a woman with a shape.",32889,2
32889,"I am not heavy set by any means, I wear a size 6 in jeans and am between smalls and mediums in tops.",32889,2
32889,I ordered this in an XL after reading reviews and it was still too small!,32889,2
32889,I realize it was made in a different country but if they expect to sell it to Americans they should model their sizing after average American women.,32889,2
32889,"Not only that but there was no way to tell on the pants what was the front of the pants and what was the back of the pants, they fit the same no matter which way I had them on, so though the fit well in the rear, they were loose in the front.",32889,2
32889,The style of the pants is very skinny/straight leg.,32889,2
32889,"The opening for nursing on the top was definitely too small, it was sewn together too low and the opening definitely needed to be open a bit higher.",32889,2
32889,For all of these reasons I had to send them back.,32889,2
32890,Missing the bra!,32890,2
32890,"I bought it a couple of months ago when my baby hasn't been born yet, so I didn't open the package until now, when i am about to take pictures for her when she is 5 months, i then realized that the bra is missing !",32890,2
32890,!!,32890,2
32890,What to do now??,32890,2
32890,?,32890,2
32891,"The item is very nice, however it says one size fits all.",32891,2
32891,I'm typically in a size 14 jeans and this skirt is much too small.,32891,2
32892,"poorly made, looks cheap",32892,2
32893,Too tight.,32893,2
32893,My daughter wears a size 1-2 and she couldn't even get her feet into her shoes with these on.,32893,2
32893,"Also, they are very difficult for kids to close themselves.",32893,2
32894,"Not what expected I am 5 1""- 107lbs.",32894,2
32894,And it just didn't look rite on.,32894,2
32894,It's a straight cut no shape.,32894,2
32894,The arms are pretty with the slits.,32894,2
32894,Unfortunately I had to return it.,32894,2
32894,They were very responsive and refunded same day I shipped it back!,32894,2
32894,Thanks.,32894,2
32895,"Everything fit well, except for the awkward arm straps.",32895,2
32895,"Maybe my shoulders are just oddly shaped, but, while the sleeves fit fine, the strap part would not lay flat on my shoulders!",32895,2
32895,"I wish it did, because it could've been a really cute shirt.",32895,2
32895,"I'm 5'9 and 140lbs, and everything fit fine with a size Large except for the arms straps.",32895,2
32895,"Fabric isn't the best quality, but only the texture reflects that.",32895,2
32896,"I originally ordered a L for my daughter, but I had to return it as the skirt was too small.",32896,2
32896,"So I went back to the seller, returned it (it was refunded the next day), and placed a new order for an XL.",32896,2
32896,"Unfortunately, the XL is also too small.",32896,2
32896,The shirt that came with the XL was smaller than the L and the skirt was the same size; with it being so close to trick or treating we will have to make do with what we now have.,32896,2
32897,It's pretty but I have to return it cause it is run really small and i get the largest one,32897,2
32898,These dresses must be made by the Munchkin women with eating disorders society.,32898,2
32899,Cheap material.,32899,2
32900,"So I ordered a xxx-lg not trying to say anything it fit but the boobs for for somebody that's in ""a"" cup.",32900,2
32900,I mean is I'm going to order that big of a size do you think my boobs are going to fit??,32900,2
32900,?,32900,2
32901,it doesnt fit well and when i tried it on you could hear a few threads pulling apart but its not to small just not made well,32901,2
32902,Just received this today.,32902,2
32902,I was going to use it for my daughters first birthday to match the pink and gold theme.,32902,2
32902,"However, we will not be able to use it since it is not pink, it is more of a peach color.",32902,2
32902,Cute bodysuit but it's not the color that is advertised.,32902,2
32903,i received the cut off tank instead of the regular tank.,32903,2
32903,wasn't worth the hassle to return it.,32903,2
32904,I bought these for my sons and nephew.,32904,2
32904,"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I got what I paid for.",32904,2
32904,2 of 4 popped in a couple of days.,32904,2
32905,Not much of a shift dress.,32905,2
32905,"I'm 5'1"" about 120lbs.",32905,2
32905,I ordered a large and It sticks to me.,32905,2
32905,It is also too short to wear without pants.,32905,2
32905,I don't suggest you buy this unless you want a tightly fitting tunic.,32905,2
32906,The top was too small.,32906,2
32906,The bottoms a tad bit too big.,32906,2
32907,Looks and feels like a pajama top,32907,2
32908,The sewing is not great on this.,32908,2
32908,The shirt started to have holes on the seams after a few washes.,32908,2
32908,:(,32908,2
32909,Super cute however the bottoms are like child size... Top fits fine,32909,2
32910,"The Silicone Tunnels are good and all but I only got five of them not six, I attempted to contact the seller before leaving a feed back and...",32910,2
32910,Nothing.,32910,2
32910,"I hate leaving negative feed back but hay, if the shoe fits.",32910,2
32911,Gave it an extra star because it looks good.,32911,2
32911,However no instructions included in this.,32911,2
32911,"Although I figured out how to use the fasteners, it's super hard to get them to attach to my dress socks, which are thin.",32911,2
32911,"Don't buys these, get another brand that uses clasps that clamp on to your socks instead for the sake of convenience.",32911,2
32912,did not work with my body,32912,2
32913,Doesn't go around my body.,32913,2
32913,I'm a size 4-6,32913,2
32914,"I really wanted to like this top, but is was too short for my torso, so instead of my booty poppin in this onsie, it was giving me a wedgie.",32914,2
32914,not cute!,32914,2
32915,"The material looks like ballet thight, you can see through and the leggs are so LONG",32915,2
32916,Generally more comfortable than regular boxer briefs.,32916,2
32916,But the cup holds the testicles too tight and the wings dig into the inguinal areas on both sides.,32916,2
32917,Poor training shoe.,32917,2
32917,Looks great but not right for interval training/cross training activities.,32917,2
32917,The velcro strap across the top is ridiculous and the lacing system is terrible compared to other Jordan brand shoes.,32917,2
32917,As with most athletic shoes the insole is terrible.,32917,2
32917,"poor cushioning and not appropriate for an apparent ""training"" shoe.",32917,2
32918,Product as described.,32918,2
32919,This item fit me in the bottom and the body.,32919,2
32919,However the breast cups were WAY too small.,32919,2
32919,I don't consider myself an extremely large breasted person for my overall size.,32919,2
32919,I would conclude the breast cups are disproportionately small.,32919,2
32919,"Also, The return period is fairly short.",32919,2
32920,"Even if it had fit properly (it was Asian sizing, not mentioned in the description anywhere) the material was not very good quality, and there were several loose thread ends hanging.",32920,2
32920,"Overall, it looked to be poorly made with very cheap material.",32920,2
32920,"There was also a very strange, NOT pleasant, smell that had permeated the bag as well as the clothing.",32920,2
32920,Will not be shopping this brand again.,32920,2
32921,Had to return for 2 sizes bigger.,32921,2
32921,Love the design.,32921,2
32922,Very cute but ran extremely small and was hand wash only.... For a workout shirt?,32922,2
32923,Not as nice looking like it is online.,32923,2
32924,Would not buy again.,32924,2
32924,Awkward fit.,32924,2
32924,Too small for a medium.,32924,2
32925,Big,32925,2
32926,Super cheap looking... and smelling.,32926,2
32926,Lots of snags fresh out of the box.,32926,2
32926,Into the donation pile it goes.,32926,2
32927,Ok for a stacker!,32927,2
32928,Bad,32928,2
32929,Not what I expected,32929,2
32930,Even w the adjustable drawstring this still did not stay on my sons head,32930,2
32931,"So disappointing, no where near the size stated for ordering.",32931,2
32931,Very small across the shoulders,32931,2
32932,just doesn't have the quality I was looking for.,32932,2
32932,"I purchased it for use at work; so, it'll 'work'!",32932,2
32933,The bag is nice.,32933,2
32933,"But, I paid $80 for the bag.",32933,2
32933,There was a store tag on the inside that said the bag was on sale for somethign like $35.00.,32933,2
32933,I emailed the proprietor and he responded that somehow he was still losing money on the deal.,32933,2
32933,"I saw something I liked and bought it so it is my responsibility, but certainly make me hesitate to shop this way again.",32933,2
32933,"Again, the bag is great, but not happy with the purchase.",32933,2
32934,the plugs are unuseable,32934,2
32935,"I did receice one dozen but in repeated colors, 2 dark blue, 2 red, 2 black, 2 green.",32935,2
32935,"I didn't receive yellow, orange, violet, brown.",32935,2
32935,I am not satisfied with double items.,32935,2
32936,I ordered this shirt a size bigger than what I needed which means im a medium but I ordered a large.,32936,2
32936,It came in the mail way earlier than expected but it came in a super small size that fits way too tight even though it was a large but other than that It looks the same as in the photo and has a good fabric.,32936,2
32936,I highly recommend that if you do buy this shirt that you be aware of the size and buy 1 or 2 sizes up from your regular size.,32936,2
32937,Kind of disappointed.,32937,2
32937,I bought these (and another similar pair by another brand) as a stocking stuffers for my daughter.,32937,2
32937,They don't screw in - so the earrings will fall out.,32937,2
32937,"They are really pretty, but I am afraid since they are loose, they will fall out and she will lose them.",32937,2
32937,:(  Not sure I should still give them to her.,32937,2
32937,Both brands won't screw in and stay tight.,32937,2
32937,BUMMER.,32937,2
32938,the glued on sequins fall off and are moopy AF.,32938,2
32938,"It's cool, but it won't last 5 wears",32938,2
32939,Don't buy this.,32939,2
32939,"This was a waste of money, it's cute I'll make it work but I bet you it won't last one wash. Strings are hanging off of it, like they just braided the seams instead of sewing them in.",32939,2
32939,They also aren't well made.,32939,2
32939,Looks cheap and kind of like something you'd wear over a nightgown.,32939,2
32940,the shape is weird and is larger than I expected,32940,2
32941,HE HAS A FLAW,32941,2
32942,Size fits as described (from 2 to 8) but still a little large for whoever wears size 2.,32942,2
32942,"The material is very thin, cheap looking, nothing like as seen on the stock photos.",32942,2
32942,The collar trim is not as wide and fluffy as seen.,32942,2
32942,"The color is also a little lighter in red, not as rich as on the photo.",32942,2
32943,This top was cheaply made and too wide.,32943,2
32943,I guess you get what you pay for.,32943,2
32944,the lenses where too large and the glasses are heavy.,32944,2
32945,"I gave this shirt to a friend because I think that it could look nice on someone much smaller than me (and I'm not going to bother returning something that came from China, that'd be more hassle than it's worth), but as an American size L in tops, there was no way that I was going to even attempt putting this on.",32945,2
32945,"I could tell that even with the side stretch in the shoulders, I would definitely be stuck in this shirt.",32945,2
32945,"The material looked thin, but as a summer shirt that would be fine.",32945,2
32945,"If you are a size Small or are a smaller Medium, this shirt would probably work for you.",32945,2
32946,This did not fit very well at all so I wound up returning it after trying it on.,32946,2
32947,Suit just didn't fit.,32947,2
32947,The bottom part was way too big but the top part fit good.,32947,2
32947,Nice looking swimsuit though.,32947,2
32948,too small,32948,2
32949,unfortunately I couldn't change the lenses so I just give it to a friend & didn't use it ):,32949,2
32950,"poor quality, you get what you pay for with this one.",32950,2
32950,Top needs support and fabric is flimsy.,32950,2
32951,Very small and thin.,32951,2
32952,This is not really a corset.,32952,2
32952,It's not going to make your waist any smaller.,32952,2
32952,The ties are actually the ribbons so if you pull it too tight it's going to break.,32952,2
32952,There's no steel boning it's all plastic boning I don't care what they say in the description and it's very thin material.,32952,2
32952,It is pretty material I wouldn't say it's cheap it's just extremely thin there are no modesty panels in the front underneath the hooks or in the back under the ties so if it doesn't fit you perfectly then whatever skin is going to show.,32952,2
32952,Also the one of the big problems with this is it's long in the front and very short in the back so it doesn't fit up under your scapula in the back your bones and so it drops down lower and it pushes all your back fat over the top of it is horrible design.,32952,2
32952,I bought another one of their corsets that's a waist cincher and it's made much better it's longer in the back.,32952,2
32953,I am a size 12 and they don't fit at all,32953,2
32954,Just was not what I wanted at all.,32954,2
32954,I was disappointed in this item.,32954,2
32955,Straps broke not happy with this product,32955,2
32956,Not as cute as on the model.,32956,2
32956,It was see through.,32956,2
32956,I ordered the white and blue outfit.,32956,2
32956,"The front was coming apart,  unseamed",32956,2
32957,This is not as pictured.,32957,2
32957,"The photo shows an empire waist, but it's at least 3 inches longer than that.",32957,2
32957,"At the worst possible, most unflattering level it could be at.",32957,2
32957,"The top also bunches at the seams, so it made me look frumpy.",32957,2
32957,"It felt nice, very smooth/silky fabric, and the length of sleeves and skirt were good, though overall felt a bit too large (I got a medium and I'm 5'7"" and a size 6ish).",32957,2
32957,"Couldn't get past how awful the top length was, wish I could because I love the chevron skirt.",32957,2
32958,Not real happy with this purchase.,32958,2
32958,Thank goodness I went for a pair that was deeply discounted ($15).,32958,2
32958,"They're not long enough, ride up and do little to nothing to prevent chaffing while running.",32958,2
32959,Two sizes too small.,32959,2
32959,When I tried to return it the company kept trying to negotiate with me.,32959,2
32960,VERY CHEAP LOOKING!,32960,2
32961,Sizes are in between.,32961,2
32961,Not very accurate.,32961,2
32962,Quality of the fabric is not good cut is ok,32962,2
32963,It was disappointed.,32963,2
32963,"When it came, it was broken in the corner and the lid was broken away from the screws.",32963,2
32963,I felt like the material used for the box was cheap.,32963,2
32964,About 2 or 3 sizes to small,32964,2
32965,Did not like these.,32965,2
32965,Did not fit around my ankle the way I thought they would.,32965,2
32966,Product does not fit per description.,32966,2
32966,Too large for asian figure.,32966,2
32966,But quality of material is good enough.,32966,2
32967,If you are broad through your shoulders and chest this suit will not fit using regular sizing.,32967,2
32967,"Also, remember that at some point you will have to go the bathroom.",32967,2
32967,Taking it off is the only way.,32967,2
32967,My son had not thought of that,32967,2
32968,want to like this piece very much as it is extremely delicate and beautiful.,32968,2
32968,"even so, the clicker is not well secured and slips in on itself frustratingly far too easily.",32968,2
32968,it also has a bit of a strange construction so that it hands in just a slightly awkward way from the septum though it's so light it doesn't have enough weight centralized to balance itself.,32968,2
32969,Chain is very long.,32969,2
32969,"Can hook up the clasp further down the chain, but then it tends to be a little crooked.",32969,2
32970,"Arrived just as pictured, but the closure broke right before wearing it but it was really prettty & the delivery was very long but it complimented my outfit nicely even with my rigging up the closure",32970,2
32971,"Half the pairs were too small in the foot and calf area, had to give them to my niece.",32971,2
32972,The waistband and legs seem to be sized differently.,32972,2
32972,The waistband is a little tight while the legs are a bit loose.,32972,2
32972,Also does not wick sweat the way other brands of bamboo do,32972,2
32973,Cheaply made and took 3 wks from China...,32973,2
32974,"This product was purchased as a gift, and I personally was not impressed.",32974,2
32974,"The color was much lighter that shown in the picture, and was more of a peach color than orange as described.",32974,2
32974,The quality and deign however was very good and that is the only reason that it didn't not receive only one star.,32974,2
32975,Would not stick well at all,32975,2
32976,It looks better in the picture but it is low quality.,32976,2
32976,"Even the plaque wuth the name was all scratched, you can barely see the name Scarleton.",32976,2
32976,I will not buy this brabd again,32976,2
32977,Fitted smaller than I thought it would.,32977,2
32978,This color is not the same as it in the picture.,32978,2
32979,Didn't fit very well and hard to use the captive balls,32979,2
32980,Made for a midget lady,32980,2
32981,It looks like the shirt was made out of a garbage bag and all they did was cut arm holes into the fabric.,32981,2
32981,The quality of the lace was awful.,32981,2
32981,"I ordered a small and it was still too large, but, what can you expect from a shirt that is only 5 bucks.",32981,2
32982,not worth it.,32982,2
32983,Fits great but material is too thin turns see thru when wet..looks see thru when dry?,32983,2
32983,"Now I have to return it or
Wear shorts?",32983,2
32984,Too small,32984,2
32985,Bought it as present for my sister.,32985,2
32985,"She hated the material, it fit weird (clung to odd places, loose at other places), and was over all a weird length.",32985,2
32985,"However, it arrived before Christmas so that was a plus.",32985,2
32986,Small,32986,2
32987,Not what I expected!!,32987,2
32987,I got one just like this with out the little plastic to protect the c-section cut at Walmart for $7 not worth the money.,32987,2
32988,Too large and too thin.,32988,2
32988,The neckline was so huge that I looked like I had on one of those old timey men's bathing suits that was a tank top but the neck scooped way down.,32988,2
32988,No thanks.,32988,2
32989,For some weird reason this wasn't a short set.,32989,2
32989,It came with pants and I really wanted it to be shorts.,32989,2
32990,Looks more green in the pic then actually was,32990,2
32991,disappointed in the size of the item,32991,2
32992,Not crazy about the quality but my sister seemed to like them as they were a gift for her!,32992,2
32992,"Mission accomplished, I guess!",32992,2
32992,!,32992,2
32993,"Way too short, it will just be a bathing suit cover up for me :/",32993,2
32994,"The pattern is cute but the stitch is white instead of a darker color, looks cheap IMO.",32994,2
32995,The idea of the product is very useful and I was very much looking forward to it.,32995,2
32995,"However, I think I received a defective unit.",32995,2
32995,"Upon receipt:

Pros:
1. the magnet works
2. the light lights up in various levels as advertised
3. useful intention/idea
4. shipped fast

Cons:
1. safety concern: scary, loud, buzzing noise as if it could explode any time during usage.",32995,2
32995,"Louder as time of keeping the light lit increases, and as number of usage increases.",32995,2
32995,2. defective USB/microUSB connector port: badly manufactured ports that have the metal parts disconnected and sticking part very slanted.,32995,2
32995,This makes the cord impossible/hard to fit and function properly.,32995,2
32995,"3. defective battery: didn't charge after 24 hours of charging, even though advertised to be max 4 hours.",32995,2
32995,4. annoying battery light indicator: Battery indicator light comes up randomly and no instruction on how to turn this indicator light on when you need it or off when it comes up bright randomly in the middle of the night.,32995,2
32995,"5. manual in machine-translated English, which could wasn't a huge problem to me in comparison to safety concerns, but is a cons after all.",32995,2
32995,"Again, it is a product of very useful idea and intention, and I'd love to use it if it were safe and functioning, but I think any product with a safety concern I can't give it more stars than 1 or 2.

so.",32995,2
32995,it is what it is.,32995,2
32995,"I'd give it a 1 star for its safety concern but hey, maybe it was just a defective unit out of many functioning ones, maybe I was just unlucky enough to stumble on one that slipped through their quality contron procedure.",32995,2
32995,So might as well give the small company some chance and not leave them the worst feedback possible I guess.,32995,2
32995,"Below are just some more detailed elaboration on the cons listed above:

1.",32995,2
32995,"The metal parts were not fused properly: the metal sheets were not even touching each other, making the ports useless and cannot function properly.",32995,2
32995,The USB connector and the microUSB heads won't be able to fit in properly.,32995,2
32995,"The flat part in the middle of the port that goes into the USB head also wasn't straight, making it even harder to connect the cord without further damaging both the unit and the cord.",32995,2
32995,2.,32995,2
32995,This was the part that I was really not okay about and the main reason why I decided to start a return.,32995,2
32995,Unit makes a really loud and scary buzzing noise when lit.,32995,2
32995,"Even at the weakest lighting level, it makes that noise as if it could explode any time.",32995,2
32995,This is also part of the reason why I think I received a defective unit.,32995,2
32995,"Or, if all units do this, then it could be a design flaw.",32995,2
32995,3.,32995,2
32995,The unit never charges completely.,32995,2
32995,I was charging it for >24 hours and the charging light remains red.,32995,2
32995,While it is advertised (on the manual) to charge fully within 4 hours.,32995,2
32995,4.,32995,2
32995,"The unit also lights up very, very randomly.",32995,2
32995,"I understand the blue light is to indicate the battery status of the unit, but it is a very bright blue light that lights up at the weirdest moments every other minutes.",32995,2
32995,"It looks like if you pick it up or change its direction after a long sitting, the bright blue light will come up.",32995,2
32995,Sometimes it just randomly comes up while I hold it in my hand.,32995,2
32995,"But when I try to replicate any of that, I cannot just make the blue light come up again either.",32995,2
32995,I have no idea what triggers it and all it says on the manual is how to read that blue light to find out its battery status.,32995,2
32995,"I've read the manual many times and even the embedded every once-so-often machine-translated parts where it isn't very readable, no key words related to how to start the process of battery reading was mentioned so I'm pretty sure it's not in there.",32995,2
32995,"5. about 30% of the manual is machine-translated English, this one didn't matter as much to me in terms of knocking out stars or not since it was just a flashlight and most of the operation was pretty straight forward, but it is a cons.",32995,2
32996,"Good stuff the only problem is when I wash it, turns everything grey",32996,2
32997,"too small and too snug  it is not appealing on
I should have order an extra large
the nice thing about the dress is the color  beautiful",32997,2
32998,This was certainly an adventure in internet purchasing.,32998,2
32998,I should have read the reviews and the sizing chart.,32998,2
32998,The first one I ordered was a medium.,32998,2
32998,It was so small I didn't even try to get it on.,32998,2
32998,I was afraid I would rip it.,32998,2
32998,Then I looked at the size chart.,32998,2
32998,Medium is a size 4.,32998,2
32998,In what country?,32998,2
32998,The land of the Lilliputians?,32998,2
32998,"Then I ordered an XXL, which I figured would be a size 12.",32998,2
32998,I was swimming in that in the armholes.,32998,2
32998,"I then got a size XL, equivalent to a size 10.",32998,2
32998,That fits ok.,32998,2
32999,To big,32999,2
33000,Way too small and hangs weirdly.,33000,2
33000,"I don't recommend it, and haven't worn it yet.",33000,2
33000,"It is really soft, but basically the size and tight elastic gave me a muffin-top.",33000,2
33000,Not exactly the elegant flowing skirt-look I was going for.,33000,2
33000,"Also, if you're taller than 5'4"" this will come above your ankle at an awkward length, unless you wear it really low, which doesn't really work because of the first issue, which is tight elastic and the small waist-size.",33000,2
33001,"Nice fit, light material.",33001,2
33001,Could be used for dress up or down.,33001,2
33001,After washing this pants I noticed a few small holes in the material.,33001,2
33002,Too small especially if you have a lot of hair.,33002,2
33003,WAY too small,33003,2
33004,"very small, I got this for my daughter she is a size 3 and a medium was too small for herl, I think a size large would've fit",33004,2
33005,It does cut down the glare but it also hides your headlights...not good for night driving....ok for day,33005,2
33006,"Loved the shirt, but sizing is definitely to small!!",33006,2
33006,Not even close to a 1x,33006,2
33007,The greet is not neon at all.,33007,2
33007,More of a navy/forest grew.,33007,2
33008,"way too small, shipped back the same day",33008,2
33009,The fit is too big for me so I can't actually use the touchscreen pads.,33009,2
33009,"Also, they don't actually warm my hands enough to keep them out of my pockets.",33009,2
33010,Ok,33010,2
33011,It is not as long as it seems to be in the picture,33011,2
33012,Too small.,33012,2
33012,Would have to carry a second wallet.,33012,2
33013,very awkward fitting cant describe,33013,2
33014,The quality was less than expected and the material was extremely itchy.,33014,2
33014,I had to take it off within two minutes of trying it on.,33014,2
33015,The dress was somewhat short!,33015,2
33016,"The sizing is very confusing on this dress, the length is small so if you plan on bending over the world would see your ****.",33016,2
33016,But the fitting around the waist and breast is large....,33016,2
33017,Beautiful material and design.. but runs a little narrow.,33017,2
33017,Especially for linen.,33017,2
33018,Just average,33018,2
33019,Smaller than advertised.,33019,2
33019,Soft nice material.,33019,2
33020,Material not good,33020,2
33021,I had hoped to wear it as a bathing suit cover up but not a chance!,33021,2
33021,I wear a size 4 and bought a LARGE.,33021,2
33021,So it's OK as a top with a top under it.,33021,2
33022,I don't like the look,33022,2
33023,"I always order XL shirts because I like a loose fit, this shirt was ridiculously small.",33023,2
33023,I squeezed it on and looked like a sausage with a small Deathly Hallows symbol in the middle of a stretched out Union Jack.,33023,2
33023,I just gave it to my wife.,33023,2
33024,"Runs small, I recommend going a size up.",33024,2
33024,It's cute but I am not really happy with this top.,33024,2
33024,The cowl sits awkwardly on my chest.,33024,2
33025,Ripped first time wearing them,33025,2
33026,Don't like the fabric.,33026,2
33027,I don't like the white slip underneath it should be pink and longer,33027,2
33028,"Didn't fit as I expected, but was a cute dress.",33028,2
33028,Just looked a little more flattering & body hugging in photo.,33028,2
33028,Back had no shape and was very unflattering to me.,33028,2
33029,These are great except that the cute bows aren't sewn or glued down in any way and your kid can pull the strips of leather out and lose them.,33029,2
33029,"Also, I went to put them on her a couple days ago and the elastic broke on one!",33029,2
33029,I've had them a month and now they are unusable.,33029,2
33029,"Of course, they broke just a couple days over the return window so now I'm stuck with an unusable pair of shoes for my toddler at the beginning of winter.",33029,2
33029,Will NOT purchase these again.,33029,2
33030,Bottoms were poorly constructed and look like big bloomers.,33030,2
33030,Messy seams around leg elastic and crotch sewn sloppily.,33030,2
33031,Super cute!,33031,2
33031,I got size 3t and the pants fit as expected but the shirt fits more like a 2t,33031,2
33032,Beautiful dress but the zipper was torn & seams were ripped.,33032,2
33032,Couldn't put it on.,33032,2
33032,Waste of $,33032,2
33033,NOT toddlers sizes!,33033,2
33033,"The toddler large is actually a big girls ""L (10-12)""

They are cute, but they won't fit if you're looking for toddler sizes!",33033,2
33034,This coat is form fitting.,33034,2
33034,It's heavy and seems to have nice quality but you can't wear a sweatshirt or sweater under it.,33034,2
33034,I failed to read the return policy and you have to pay to return it to China.,33034,2
33034,I would have never took a chance on it if I had to pay to return it.,33034,2
33034,They did email me to verify my size and I stated I was like a larger fitting coat and shipped it.,33034,2
33035,This shirt is made of quality material but the sizes run two sizes small.,33035,2
33036,This suit was teeny tiny.,33036,2
33036,It was basically a thong in the back.,33036,2
33036,Not what I expected and I didn't care for the material.,33036,2
33036,I sent it back.,33036,2
33037,It was really cute but broke shortly after ordering it.,33037,2
33037,It's very delicate.,33037,2
33038,Disappointed with material..,33038,2
33039,Incredibly small!,33039,2
33039,"I ordered a 3x and it was the size of an American medium, by my estimation.",33039,2
33039,Definitely be aware of this when considering the purchase.,33039,2
33039,It's a shame because the colors and pattern were so pretty.,33039,2
33040,The size is a little smaller than listed,33040,2
33041,Wrong color,33041,2
33042,its cute but the arms are so tight and the shirt is see through,33042,2
33043,"I didn't expect them to wear like iron, but, on the other hand, I did expect to be able wear them at least once.",33043,2
33043,The ones with the cherub on them got a 'run' - a hole - as they were being put on for the first time,33043,2
33044,"This item, while exactly as shown in the picture, fell apart quite quickly.",33044,2
33044,"I was for my teenage daughter, but she isn't roughers on her jewelry than any other teenager.",33044,2
33044,I would only recommend it for an adult who can be very careful with their possessions.,33044,2
33045,didn't like the fit,33045,2
33046,Purchased a large for my teenager and it was too small.,33046,2
33047,Pretty comfortable.,33047,2
33047,I had to return my Bravado silk nursing bra because it was too tight.,33047,2
33047,Then I found these for half the price.,33047,2
33047,I'm pregnant and sizing st a 40DD.,33047,2
33047,The XL fit well.,33047,2
33047,My complaints are the straps are a little closer to my shoulders than most bras which cause them to slip off often and the inside part has a panel that is irritating.,33047,2
33047,"I am dealing with it but since it's too late to return it, I'm going to go ahead buy the Bravado silk bra since it was way better.",33047,2
33048,Gorgeous suit and fast shipping however WAYYYYYYYY innacurate sizing!,33048,2
33048,NOWHERE NEAR CORRECT SIZE!,33048,2
33048,I wear a 22w in plus size with minimal tummy fat since having a tummy tuck bought two sizes too big due to some feedback and this suit is nowhere near a 4XL it didn't even fit my niece who is a size 14/16,33048,2
33049,Need to be more control top like at the body of the tights.,33049,2
33049,Kept coming down,33049,2
33050,The size is great but they turned me green a,33050,2
33051,If you do not have a serious flat tummy and a banging bod....this outfit is not for you.,33051,2
33052,The items were not as expected,33052,2
33053,Material to think for work how to return,33053,2
33054,material is like spandex and pantie hose...i didn't like it,33054,2
33055,"10 Page 20 Card Plastic Wallet Insert for my wallet, but it doesn't quite fit my wallet.",33055,2
33056,It's hard for me to write a negative review.... my boobs (natural) don't fit in much.,33056,2
33056,So while the rest of this was cute because of my boobs it made everything too small,33056,2
33057,I thought they were going to be small but they r the size of nickels damn near,33057,2
33058,I ordered size M based on the reviews I read.,33058,2
33058,This is a two-pack.,33058,2
33058,I received what seemed to be a small and a medium even though both were labeled medium.,33058,2
33058,I could tell there was a size difference as soon as I took them out of the package.,33058,2
33058,There is absolutely a size difference between the two when I lay the smaller one on time of the larger one.,33058,2
33059,"I got mine in the mail and it was broken ( or so I believe ) the straps  that wrap around my wrist were not connected , and I couldn't connect them myself .",33059,2
33059,The description says nothing about assmebly,33059,2
33060,Broke really easily.,33060,2
33061,I'm giving two stars because when I received them I only had 2 of the 3.,33061,2
33061,"I'm too lazy to return them, cute though.",33061,2
33062,"I love tokidoki,and the scissors definitely deliver the cute.",33062,2
33062,"Unfortunately, they're not great scissors.",33062,2
33062,The first pair broke in two while trying to cut a gauze wrap off a patient.,33062,2
33062,"They were replaced, but they're still extremely dull and make it difficult to get the job done.",33062,2
33063,The material is very strange.,33063,2
33063,"It's really scratchy, I thought after I washed it they would soften up but they didnt.",33063,2
33063,"I ordered a size larger than normal, the arms were tight and the body part was huge.",33063,2
33063,"Also, the material would be a ironing nightmare.",33063,2
33064,When this dress arrived there were a bunch of wrinkles in it that I thought would come out in the wash.,33064,2
33064,When they didn't I thought ironing it would work.,33064,2
33064,"However, it is just the way the dress was sewn.",33064,2
33064,The sides flare out to a point very unflatteringly and the lower back has a weird wrinkle from poor sewing.,33064,2
33064,"I think the dress could be classy, but it is thin and a little cheap.",33064,2
33064,Not what I was expecting.,33064,2
33064,Returning.,33064,2
33065,It's okay,33065,2
33066,Small where it counts...;-(,33066,2
33067,"The shirt is good quality but the logo was WAY smaller than it appears, that was the only problem I had with this purchase.",33067,2
33068,Not a very strong strap don't get for high schooler with lots of books straps broke in two weeks,33068,2
33069,The top is extremely see-through and the skirt is very cheap.,33069,2
33069,The waistband on the skirt is so tight it cuts into my skin.,33069,2
33069,I guess you get what you pay for.,33069,2
33070,"is not very confortable, and too big.",33070,2
33070,"It does fit under glasses, but they are not ergonomic in the least level..  i wanted these to ride on my motorcycle, but wind and dust get inside from underneath.. i had a similar one before that also were over sunglasses...  plastic also is kinda ugly..",33070,2
33071,Super short.,33071,2
33071,Will wear as a shirt,33071,2
33072,"Thin, almost see through.",33072,2
33072,Different colors in the crochet make it look faded.,33072,2
33072,"Wanted to love it, but it fell very short",33072,2
33073,"Within 30 days, a snap broke.",33073,2
33074,Cute!!,33074,2
33074,!,33074,2
33075,Jewels fell off as soon as she put them on.,33075,2
33075,Would not recommend,33075,2
33076,I found this item to be bigger in size than I had expected.,33076,2
33077,I wore this for 3 days after I had the baby and immediately the fabric would fold over in the back.,33077,2
33077,It was also too big to wear after the first week so now I have to buy another band to keep wearing.,33077,2
33077,It was definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it.,33077,2
33078,"These are supposed to be 19 inches and are only 18, so are shorter than they claim!",33078,2
33079,"The rings turned color in one wearing,so now i have copper rings instead of gold.",33079,2
33079,Wont buy again.,33079,2
33080,Not my thing.,33080,2
33080,My ring still flips around but now this ugly plastic thing shows.,33080,2
33080,The thicker ones keep it in place but they're bulky.,33080,2
33081,I thought these were wrap around sun glasses.,33081,2
33081,They do not fit comfortable worn over regular glasses,33081,2
33082,Cheap scratchy whool.,33082,2
33082,Doesn't really look like the photo,33082,2
33083,I don't know what good this pants is for but for winter it will not be good at all material too thin.,33083,2
33084,This product was thin and kinda had a cheap appearance.,33084,2
33084,It had a hole in the skirt when I received it.,33084,2
33084,The return process was seamless tho.,33084,2
33085,"I love love love this product, started wearing at 16 weeks 6-7 days a week.",33085,2
33085,I have only had it for 2 months though and the edges are totally frayed and now come undone...working on getting an exchange.,33085,2
33086,Not what it looked like online.,33086,2
33086,But oh well.,33086,2
33087,The larger size is not cut proportionately for a larger body.,33087,2

33207,The entire back is shear blue with a white star pattern and is actually super pretty.,33207,2
33207,It's the same as the shear pocket you see sewn to the front.,33207,2
33207,I would have worn it with a tank or maybe some cute colorful sports bra.,33207,2
33207,But the dress-like length is why I sent it back.,33207,2
33208,"Quiet small, fit one long purse & cellphone , some small accessories.",33208,2
33208,"The surface is nice and good color , I just hope they can make it bigger",33208,2
33209,way to small.,33209,2
33210,Cute suit but doesn't fit.,33210,2
33210,If you're a company all about 'Swimsuits for All' chances are your customers need a little more fabric.,33210,2
33210,The Size 10 I ordered barely fit and I'm a true size 10 in everything I wear.,33210,2
33210,"The top of this suit is better suited for a A or B cup, my boobs were spilling out of it everywhere , definitely not suitable for a D cup at all.",33210,2
33211,"There were only 2 in the package, not 3 as advertised.",33211,2
33211,The one I really wanted was the opalite and that's the one that was missing :(,33211,2
33212,Buyer beware.,33212,2
33212,It's not as advertised.,33212,2
33212,I received no chain and only one tiny jump ring for the other side of the pendant.,33212,2
33212,I now have to buy a chain and try to get this together in a rush.,33212,2
33212,The pendant itself though does look decent.,33212,2
33213,The fabric feels cheap.,33213,2
33213,The construction is so-so.,33213,2
33213,The fit is skimpy.,33213,2
33213,"I am 6'1"", 190 lbs, 33 waist, and wear a 44 long sportcoat.",33213,2
33213,This shirt is skimpy across the shoulders.,33213,2
33213,"I like the long tail -- it stays tucked in -- but overall, the shirt is big-box-discount-store inferior quality.",33213,2
33214,Poorly made.,33214,2
33214,Regretted the purchase.,33214,2
33214,Fits too loose.,33214,2
33214,Paper weight and flimsy.,33214,2
33215,Runs very small!,33215,2
33215,"We went by the sizing indicated, but they are still too small (particularly in the legs) for my baby.",33215,2
33216,The top ran small the bottoms are ok.,33216,2
33216,There is a moldy odor that it took 3 washings to get it out.,33216,2
33217,Straps are WAY too thin for cups this large.,33217,2
33217,"And the cups are MASSIVE, far bigger than I expected.",33217,2
33217,"I ordered the 54, which was comparable to my clothing size, and I wear a 40D.",33217,2
33217,"The bottoms were a bit snug, but would have been okay if the top fit.",33217,2
33218,terrible and has some stains on the lenses,33218,2
33219,Smaller than expected and had a tear in it.,33219,2
33220,"Bought black and cocoa 2 years back, was very pleased with both pants.",33220,2
33220,"This year, decided to buy 5 colours becuase I trust that I will be plz, when they arrived, got so disappointed the navy and cocoa was see through n still more colors will be arriving soon, waiting to be more disappointed.",33220,2
33220,Hate when they mix good linen and bad.,33220,2
33220,So sad,33220,2
33221,Shoe packaging was completely in Chinese so US size could not be verified but shoes fit correctly.,33221,2
33221,Construction quality is suspect as bows only lasted a few weeks before falling off and socks were stained by shoes after wearing.,33221,2
33222,Ran very small,33222,2
33223,If wear them very long they turn into copper looking wire.,33223,2
33224,The materialis a bit loose,33224,2
33225,"Get 2 extra sizes up cause I got Large and the zipper didn't want to go up, now I just have it handing in my closet without use.",33225,2
33225,I dolby know I can't return it or do anything with it,33225,2
33226,Very disappointed in this product.,33226,2
33226,Unusual fit and the design is off center.,33226,2
33226,Would not buy again.,33226,2
33227,I wear a large and I received  4x and it was to small sizing was a real problem.,33227,2
33227,And did not look at all like the photo.,33227,2
33227,The fur was very scarce.,33227,2
33228,They are large briefs that ride way up!,33228,2
33229,I'm giving this two stars because I love the design However it's not as long so it can't be worn as a dress.,33229,2
33229,The material is so cheap that it pills if anything touches it-bums me out as it's so cute!,33229,2
33229,I guess one can't expect much when one doesn't pay that much-too bad as it's so wasteful.,33229,2
33230,This was you can see-through all most you can see your body like you ware nothig,33230,2
33231,"I'm not sure which part of the ear these are made for, but the place that the heart separates is in the wrong spot.",33231,2
33231,It needs to be closer to the top of the heart so that you can see that it's a heart when you wear it.,33231,2
33231,"Otherwise it just hangs funny, is painful, and extremely easy to lose.",33231,2
33232,NO vertical boning prevents it from being held up properly and it creates rolls on my otherwise slim body,33232,2
33233,"The belt is broken, practically with out use!",33233,2
33234,These are hefty and heavy.,33234,2
33234,Vrry sturdy.,33234,2
33234,"The colors are beautiful, but the silverwork just looks semi-cheap.",33234,2
33234,Had higher hopes for these.,33234,2
33235,Way too big,33235,2
33236,"Loved the material, but if your looking for a baggy comfy shirt like the photos do not buy this!",33236,2
33236,"It is still cute on but more like a regular fitted T-shirt, I am a US size 6-8 and I ordered the large because I wanted it baggy/comfy.... That was definitely not what I got.",33236,2
33237,"Upset with purchase, thinking of returning.",33237,2
33238,Have to hold to the ear-not loud,33238,2
33239,I'm not sure what country this sweater was produced in to have the size be so incredibly small.,33239,2
33239,"I'm 5'4"" and 150lbs, but it was way too snug.",33239,2
33239,Ended up giving it to my 11 year old daughter instead - fit her perfectly!,33239,2
33240,Very thin material.,33240,2
33240,It is not stretchy without pulling out some stitches on each side of the sweater.,33240,2
33240,I did not pull it too much and it kinda just fell apart at the seems.,33240,2
33240,It's also almost totally see through so just be mindful that something MUST be worn under it unless you want all to see your goodies.,33240,2
33241,sizing is off,33241,2
33242,the angle is too small to use,33242,2
33243,Very cute!,33243,2
33244,The top was RIDICULOUSLY small.,33244,2
33244,The bottoms fit per size.,33244,2
33245,Not so great for me.,33245,2
33245,"Lens, while nice and big, distorted my vision.",33245,2
33246,Ok,33246,2
33247,The sleeves are not as long as the measurement.,33247,2
33247,I will keep the shirt but i would not buy another.,33247,2
33248,Poor quality.,33248,2
33248,Could see through the material and the top ran smaller than anticipated.,33248,2
33249,"I bought this with the hope to wear under some dresses but there is a TON of material on these shorts -- not sure who the fit model is, but definitely not good for anyone under 5'7''.",33249,2
33249,I much prefer the Bevelation that Amazon also sells.,33249,2
33249,Bummed because sending them back was a pain (they don't send return labels so you have to stand in line at whatever carrier you choose and I definitely don't have time for that.,33249,2
33250,It really needs to be groomed to look good and the cut is very small.,33250,2
33250,It looked like a fur collar when buttoned and not a shawl/wrap.,33250,2
33250,It was too late to return so Im giving it to my 11yr old.,33250,2
33251,I did,33251,2
33252,To small in the bust area and sleeves were short from my under arm...love the color and material but didn't fit properly.,33252,2
33252,:(,33252,2
33253,Fits like a cheap shirt.,33253,2
33253,But funny.,33253,2
33253,I cut off the sleeves.,33253,2
33254,I ordered but didn't get the product pictured.,33254,2
33254,"Instead I got the ""Vampire Blood"" in the clear container listed in another store.",33254,2
33254,Not real happy with it.,33254,2
33254,"Turns pinkish orange on white sheets,  nothing like what's pictured.",33254,2
33254,"So far it has stained everything it touches,  including my hands.",33254,2
33254,"Put some on a wall to try it out,  painted over it with the original wall paint and it still shows!",33254,2
33255,The rings were really big and looked weird when I put them on.,33255,2
33256,They break really easy Buyer Becarful,33256,2
33257,"Usually wear a medium, so ordered a large because reviews said they run small.",33257,2
33257,"The large fit a 29-30in waist roughly, and that would be snug.",33257,2
33258,I returned this item.,33258,2
33258,The quality of the item was poor my ring had a defect and one of the chips was missing.,33258,2
33258,The sizing seemed larger than it shoul be.,33258,2
33259,Runs very small.,33259,2
33260,The fit was too small in the shoulders.,33260,2
33261,"didn't fit at all , cat ears came broken , it was a s***ty dress and the material it was made out of was crappy as well it was returned not worth your money tbh especially if you have a different body shape",33261,2
33262,these would be great for someone with extremely skinny legs.,33262,2
33262,didn't even go up over my knee,33262,2
33263,held together with some type of elastic very fragile the beads and metal seals are rough and can get irritating.,33263,2
33264,sizing is off,33264,2
33265,Sizing was wrong girlfriend really like look and design,33265,2
33266,It was unpolished.,33266,2
33266,It had rough metal burrs all over one of the earrings making it too difficult to wear.,33266,2
33267,I use it as backup only.,33267,2
33267,The material is thinner than DeLuca NATO bands.,33267,2
33267,The material in this band irritates my skin if I sweat just a bit and it is winter right now.,33267,2
33268,cute dress but your XXL was actually for a Skinny woman,33268,2
33269,Disappointed at the fit.,33269,2
33269,I usually wear a 6.5 in woman's but when I ordered these the shoe looks and feels way tighter than expected.,33269,2
33269,Sucks but I Yess I'll have to try and break them in,33269,2
33270,My granddaughter was delighted to receive these shoes as a gift.,33270,2
33270,Unfortunately they have not worn well as school shoes.,33270,2
33270,I am very disappointed that they didn't last through a winter as indoor school shoes.,33270,2
33270,She wore a different pair during PE class.,33270,2
33270,I would not recommend purchasing these shoes for school age girls.,33270,2
33271,It looks good in the picture.,33271,2
33271,It didnot fit properly in my ears.,33271,2
33271,It was hard to make it fit for my ears.,33271,2
33272,The bead doesn't hold a glow for more than a minute and the finish started to rub off after a week.,33272,2
33272,Might be good for a child though.,33272,2
33273,The fit was fine but the back straps were not the same as shown in the photo.,33273,2
33273,"Also the design was sort of cartoon-y, didn't really resemble the photograph.",33273,2
33274,The band fell off the one day I wore it,33274,2
33275,Looks cute in screen but cut way too small.,33275,2
33275,I thought it would be okay for work but the fit is too snug and I'm far too curvy to have something that form fitting.,33275,2
33276,good,33276,2
33277,Not enough arch support for my troubled feet.,33277,2
33278,I ordered this ring and i wear a size 7 on my ring finger.,33278,2
33278,This ring came in as a size 5.,33278,2
33278,"It fits my pinky ring, very disappointed.",33278,2
33278,Hopefully my little sister can ware is someday.,33278,2
33278,"But besides all that its a really pretty ring, its just the size.",33278,2
33279,My wife loved this purse.,33279,2
33279,After a month or so of use the zippers began breaking off.,33279,2
33279,"When I say a month or so of use, I mean maybe wearing the purse once or twice per week for a month (a total of 8 times).",33279,2
33279,"She doesn't over use zippers by any means, they just started falling off.",33279,2
33279,There may be 1 or 2 functional zippers left on the purse.,33279,2
33279,She has now stopped wearing the purse because of the zipper issue.,33279,2
33280,I love the drape.,33280,2
33280,I love that it is lined.,33280,2
33280,I love how the fabric feels.,33280,2
33280,I love everything about this skirt except that it is astronomically small and that the hem is surged and not properly hemmed.,33280,2
33280,"I would ignore the hem if only it fit, but it is not even close to the size chart
.",33280,2
33280,Rats.,33280,2
33280,Just rats...,33280,2
33281,"It's a very cute umbrella,  but was bent with in a day of normal use.",33281,2

33283,These shoes are too cute.,33283,2
33283,"However, the color was not red like it was listed.",33283,2
33283,Definitely pink!,33283,2
33283,The size was also pretty big.,33283,2
33284,"Haha I think ""Asian size"" is listed just to make you feel bad.",33284,2
33284,"I have a 29"" waist and mediums where WAAY too small not to be crude but I was much larger than the pouch in front... more so something to buy for a good laugh not to make you look sexy",33284,2
33285,"I had to order this item 3 times before they actually sent me the right size, but regardless of which size they sent the band that goes around the ribcage was RIDICULOUSLY big!",33285,2
33285,"It is slightly adjustable, but not enough.",33285,2
33285,The medium bottoms fit well enough (I'm a size 6-8) but the top just hung there not even touching my body.,33285,2
33285,The cup size was smaller in the medium vs the large but not the other part.,33285,2
33285,"I'm a 34C, so I'm not unusually small in the ribs.",33285,2
33285,Medium tops usually fit me.,33285,2
33285,"That said, the suit did seem like good quality and I love the cut and colors.",33285,2
33285,I returned it but would have totally kept it were it not for the strange sized top.,33285,2
33286,"I got extra small and it was wayy to big, im 5' and 90 pounds so shopping can be difficult",33286,2
33287,The swimsuit is for small breast women.,33287,2
33287,No top support and the sides were too tight making my skin bulge out,33287,2
33288,"I received my order,took a little long but after all that it was wrong color!!",33288,2
33288,Regret order,33288,2
33289,"Medium is too tight, unfortunately I waited too long to return in.",33289,2
33289,Very nice product but fits too small if you are ordering a medium.,33289,2
33289,I should have ordered a large.,33289,2
33290,"bought two of these for my nieces, the fit ok, but the arms were tight, they could not move their arms easily.",33290,2
33290,and there was something wrong with the shirt from the sides.,33290,2

33299,a lot of loose threading all over.,33299,2
33299,For the size it is a little smaller than expected.,33299,2
33299,Also material thinner like a shirt not a sweater or knit cape as what i was expecting considering the description of the product when ordering,33299,2
33300,The clasp is cheaply made and wore out within a month.,33300,2
33300,Already purchased a different band with a buckle so I know it will stay together.,33300,2

33306,"The sleeves hit your elbow and back hits right below waist, definitely does NOT look like the photo with the gal in jean shorts and black hat.",33306,2
33306,Disappointed because it looked so cute in the picture.,33306,2
33307,rather take L if you size M otherwise it's a bit too small and close to the skin,33307,2
33308,"You get what you pay for, this didn't fit, thank gosh for free returns",33308,2
33309,cheap looking,33309,2

33312,I was surprised to see this was really really small.,33312,2
33312,I thought the material was like a generic tie bag too.,33312,2
33312,Like a cheap scarf.,33312,2
33312,"It pretty colors, but when you really look at it It reminds me of a purse liner.",33312,2
33312,gross feeling to wear and I couldn't wear it and bought the biggest size.,33312,2
33312,"My 8 year old daughter could wear it as a dress though, so I guess she got a new play dress.",33312,2

33321,"Some pieces are longer than others, causing the entire thing to be sort of wavy, rather than flat.",33321,2
33321,"The cash section is difficult to use; bills folded in half fit size wise, but the material is a bit 'sticky' making bills not want to go in easily.",33321,2
33321,I have an old Knomo wallet that looks nearly identical to this that is just worn out (and they don't make it anymore).,33321,2
33321,"I was trying to get something similar, but will look elsewhere.",33321,2

33326,Cute but the ball was stuck,33326,2
33327,It's not really what they advertise.,33327,2
33327,- the color isn't vivid like in the photo.,33327,2
33327,"- Baggy in the arms, bunchy at the shoulders/armpits, loose at the waist... Kind of feels like I'm wearing a triangle.",33327,2
33327,"- Material is okay,  I can totally see myself wearing this during spring/summer
-  hood strings are very low quality.",33327,2
33327,Don't pull one end too far or you'll never get it out of the hood again!,33327,2
33327,"Overall I'll still wear it, but my experience with this product has steered me away from other Mooncolour items I have been interested in.",33327,2
33328,Tore a small hole in the crotch almost right away.,33328,2
33328,Super soft too bad they tear,33328,2
33329,"I was excited when I received this shirt, but disappointed in the size.",33329,2
33329,I ordered a size larger than i normally wear and it was still too tight.,33329,2
33329,I had to return it.,33329,2
33330,The romper was definitely soft and felt warm but it looked like a bunny costume with teeth instead of stitch.,33330,2
33331,"Very cute and made of soft materials, but the size ran at least a full size bigger.",33331,2
33331,My daughter was disappointed she could not wear them and there wasn't enough time to exchange.,33331,2
33332,"I was so excited to get this and I loved the bottoms, but if you are a busty girl, BEWARE!",33332,2
33332,It was way too small.,33332,2
33332,"I am 5'3, and about 160 lbs.",33332,2
33332,I have an average medium waist and wear a 38 or 40D Bust.,33332,2
33332,"I bought a XXXL and was positive that was going to be too big, but I was mistaken.",33332,2
33332,"The product itself is beautiful, but the sizes are misleading.",33332,2
33332,"Again, not for busty girls!",33332,2
33332,!,33332,2
33333,"I bought this for the saying and you would need a magnified glass to read it, dissappointed",33333,2
33334,I am quite disappointed.,33334,2
33334,"My daughter really wanted this sweatshirt, so we ordered it.",33334,2
33334,The good news is that it came faster than we were quoted.,33334,2
33334,The very BAD news is that it is NOT a sweatshirt AT ALL!!!,33334,2
33334,The picture on here is very misleading because it shows a sweatshirt and the item we got was some weird silky shirt.,33334,2
33334,"Since it was supposed to be a sweatshirt, I ordered bigger so it could be baggy and cozy.",33334,2
33334,Now the random silky item will just be huge.,33334,2
33334,:( I am still going to give it to my daughter for Christmas to see what she thinks since it is still a huge picture of Justin Bieber... and I don't have time to replace it before Christmas.,33334,2
33334,"We will see what she thinks, but it is very likely we will be returning it because it is NOT what is advertised.",33334,2
33334,Such a bummer because she was so excited about what she saw online.,33334,2
33334,:(,33334,2
33335,I loved this purse when I first got it!,33335,2
33335,I got compliments on it and everything.,33335,2
33335,Next think I know the zipper acts up won't zip.,33335,2
33335,Then I go to zip it and the zipper rips off.,33335,2
33335,Now it's basically ripping in half.,33335,2
33335,All the stitching on the side is coming undone.,33335,2
33335,Have to invest in another purse.,33335,2
33335,I love the design of the purse but the quality sucks.,33335,2
33336,One  wash and  it shrunk,33336,2
33337,very loose on the pandora chain.,33337,2
33338,My daughter did not like these at all.,33338,2
33338,They were too big and the design was not attractive.,33338,2
33339,Very disappointing as it is displayed as a bulky sweater capable of providing more than a mere annoyance for the cost and constant pulling and tugging at it to make it drape properly!,33339,2
33340,These are about two sizes smaller than marked.,33340,2
33341,It wasn't what the photo showed.,33341,2
33342,Very thin and runs very small.,33342,2
33342,"I normally wear an XL and ordered a 2x because it is chilly at night here and wanted to be able to layer under it, it barely fits.",33342,2
33343,Looks stamped out of a machine.,33343,2
33343,Not actually designed to fit a human body as far as I can tell.,33343,2
33343,Not worth the bother to return it.,33343,2
33343,I might bring the froofy armpits in.,33343,2
33343,Doesn't look great.,33343,2
33343,Passable maybe with a cardigan.,33343,2
33343,Also very thin.,33343,2
33344,poor quality.,33344,2
33344,The bottom of the dress is simply 1 layer of swimsuit material,33344,2
33345,"hated every part of this dress, no where did it fit right.",33345,2
33345,"baggy, tight.....cheaptly made.. sheer.. there wasn't one good thing about this dress.. i guess you get hit you pay for",33345,2
33346,"It's super thin so when it says warm,  perhaps they mean the color.",33346,2
33346,I'd you just want to add color top your wardrobe it would be fine but not practical.,33346,2
33346,Keyring?,33346,2
33346,Nope.,33346,2
33347,I own 3 other tops by this company.,33347,2
33347,No problems with my others but this top broke putting it on.,33347,2
33348,Too light weight.,33348,2
33348,Too small.,33348,2
33349,Seems of decent quality but pretty much useless for me.,33349,2
33349,After putting just a few of my cards in it would not stay closed/latched,33349,2
33350,Not supportive enough without a bra.,33350,2
33350,Would probably be flattering for size a and b cup size as a pajama shirt but not appropriate for anything else.,33350,2
33351,This is not secure - pills fall out easily- the clasp needs to be more secure,33351,2
33352,"They was pretty, but after two days they just broke.",33352,2
33352,I had them on my head and they just broke...,33352,2
33353,Just didn't look right on me...,33353,2
33354,I returned this necklace.,33354,2
33354,It was way too big.,33354,2
33354,"Arrived packaged nicely, but it is an inch or two too long.",33354,2
33355,It was smaller than expected,33355,2
33356,Looked nothing like the picture and didn't fit even though I ordered a size larger.,33356,2
33356,No problem with refund though.,33356,2
33356,Just a little slower than  I would like.,33356,2
33357,But didn't return because I wore it once to therapy.,33357,2
33358,The strip keeps falling off,33358,2
33359,The first day I used it there was a problem.,33359,2
33359,The clasp is faulty.,33359,2
33359,The thing on the pink side that is supposed to snap in is stuck in the closest snap.,33359,2
33359,It is just not bad to look at otherwise.,33359,2
33359,A bit bigger than I would have liked also but that's not the seller's fault.,33359,2
33359,I'm sure it would cost more to return it from here in Trinidad  or I would have immediately.,33359,2
33359,What a disappointing birthday gift to myself : (,33359,2
33360,"Material was not as expected, very cheap made.",33360,2
33360,Button at top broke as soon as I tried it on the first time.,33360,2
33360,Already returned.,33360,2
33361,Nice bracelet but my wrist is on the smaller side and its very tight so i wouldnt buy unless you have a tiny wrist,33361,2
33362,Beautiful just as pictured but broke into two pieces after a week,33362,2
33363,"The bikini is cute, and I really like the model, which is comfortable.",33363,2
33363,"However, the top and bottom parts definitely don't go together size-wise.",33363,2
33363,"I have a pretty standard size (I'm 5'5'' and 128 pounds), but I read the bikini ran small, so I ordered a size L. The top was too big, which I was kind of expecting, but not that bad (I'm a 34 B).",33363,2
33363,"However, the bottom was way too small.",33363,2
33363,"Particularly, the elastic waist band is very stiff and has no give whatsoever, which makes it really uncomfortable and very unflattering.",33363,2
33363,"I'll be returning it, even though I was really excited when I ordered it.",33363,2
33364,A little stiff not what I expected.,33364,2
33365,Touch didn't work on my phone.,33365,2
33366,It's really cute but when I opened the bag it smelled horrible.,33366,2
33366,It has this horrible smell in the yarn.,33366,2
33366,I hope the smell washes out.,33366,2
33366,Also it's not a soft thread it's scratchy kinda stiff yarn.,33366,2
33366,:(,33366,2
33367,The pants are very thin.,33367,2
33368,Alright quality material but runs SUPER SMALL.,33368,2
33368,I'm not going to be able to wear mine at all due to it's smallness :( it's an extra large and it fits my little brother better than it fits me...,33368,2
33369,The zipper made two holes on my jeans.,33369,2
33369,My jeans are $90.,33369,2
33369,Bad investment.,33369,2
33369,Sharp Zipper edges.,33369,2
33369,Be careful.,33369,2
33370,"I really want to like this romper, since it fits well, except for two major issues:

- The material is awful and weird.",33370,2
33370,"- The straps were sewn wrong in two entirely different yet wrong ways, resulting in an end product that can't be tightened.",33370,2
33370,"On top of that, but the straps are totally different lengths.",33370,2
33370,It's a super weird issue that I've never come across before but totally makes me wary of Choies apparel.,33370,2
33370,I'm keeping the romper since sending it back would cost more than the cost of the item.,33370,2
33370,"Thankfully, my local alterations guy is willing to fix the straps for super duper cheap, or else this would be a total wash of a purchase.",33370,2
33371,The top fit but the shorts were way too big.,33371,2
33371,These sizes are all wrong.,33371,2
33372,Hi i was unhappy because i order size 30 and i got size32.,33372,2
33372,Its way to big for my son.,33372,2
33373,"It was the same size as the other one, but no fit!",33373,2
33373,Leg bands were sewn tight instead of stretchable!,33373,2
33374,It's Chinese sized so go larger then you normally would,33374,2
33375,"I love the way this looks in the picture but in real life, it looks like a plastic ring you'd get out of a gumball machine.",33375,2
33375,"Cute for a kid and sized for a kid, but not real jewelry at all.",33375,2
33376,doesnt close well.,33376,2
33376,"opens constantly, nice it has different lenght chains.",33376,2
33376,"Barely fit my iphone 6S, not something i would reorder,",33376,2
33377,Was a great suit but after 2 wears the clasp broke.,33377,2
33378,It was supposted to be 6 not one,33378,2
33379,Not bad but the black is wearing off kinda quickly.,33379,2
33380,looks like you are the matador of a bull fight,33380,2
33381,"It's really really big, doesn't fit like an under armour shirt.",33381,2
33381,I'd order a size smaller.,33381,2
33381,The stone color is more of an gold than a gray hue.,33381,2
33382,I DONT LIKE IT...,33382,2
33383,Jewel came out after wearing twice :(  Pretty disappointing.,33383,2
33384,"The ring was very nice at first, but after wearing just a short period it broke.",33384,2
33385,Almost should be listed as a crop top.,33385,2
33386,I really wanted to like these gloves.,33386,2
33386,But I returned them.,33386,2
33386,"Two major issues: 1) The fleece inside isn't sewn in very well, so, it takes a few seconds to get all your fingers in correctly (and I don't have very big hands).",33386,2
33386,"Not a total deal-breaker, but it bugs me every time I put them on.",33386,2
33386,2) The deal breaker issue is that these gloves take FOREVER to dry.,33386,2
33386,"These gloves are definitely warm, but, if there's any moisture from sweat or snow, etc.",33386,2
33386,it can take up to 5 days to dry out.,33386,2
33386,RIDICULOUS!,33386,2
33386,"At this price point, it's unacceptable to me that these would stay wet (on the inside) for that long.",33386,2
33386,"I've never had an issue with gloves like this before, so, as much as I wanted to like them, they had to go back.",33386,2
33387,I couldn't get these to stay on for anything.,33387,2
33387,Maybe I don't know what I'm doing.,33387,2
33388,Cool shoes although one of the lights sometimes works and that one light is a different color when the rest are all the same.,33388,2
33389,This is Way to Big and kinda wierd,33389,2
33390,Great concept but elastic stretched out after 2nd use,33390,2
33391,smelled moldy,33391,2
33392,Absoloutly not what I was expecting.,33392,2
33392,"It was a ok dress, but not good enough for me to wear as my wedding dress.",33392,2
33392,It is also not good for women with big hips/butts.,33392,2
33393,Cute but even the size large doesn't even attempt to close over my bust.,33393,2
33394,"If you think this will hide a tummy, you are wrong.",33394,2
33394,"It looks like it might, but material is thin and doesn't sit right.",33394,2
33395,Well its shorter then stated & not in the color I ordered so its in a zip lock & will be given as a gift,33395,2
33396,This fits over only one thigh!,33396,2
33396,It's made for women who are a size 2 not bigger,33396,2
33397,Very comfortable if you plan on wearing around the house or under another tank in public.,33397,2
33397,"This not a suitable tank for wearing under professional clothing, etc.",33397,2
33397,It is also a ribbed style tank that automatically makes it look cheap.,33397,2
33397,The material is very thin and can be seen through.,33397,2
33398,At first I liked it.,33398,2
33398,"It's very pretty, arrived on time, and fit around my neck perfectly.",33398,2
33398,"After a three or four days parts of it started to chip off and now, almost a month later, the entire thing has changed to a different color.",33398,2
33398,If you're thinking about buying this for someone as a gift you might want to reconsider it.,33398,2
33399,The pictures are not of the product that you receive.,33399,2
33399,The pics are of the original item made by Seven Til Midnight here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BJORMES  an item which I've purchased and really liked.,33399,2
33399,"So I thought this would be the same or very similar, but it's a cheap knockoff.",33399,2
33399,"For example, the Seven til Midnight version has a slit in both sides of the bottoms, and Etaoline's pics show these same slits.",33399,2
33399,"But the product itself has no slits, just a triangular patch of lace sewed on over the shorts (see my attached pics).",33399,2
33399,They aren't cut as flirty or sexy either.,33399,2
33399,"Additionally, they aren't nearly as soft or silky.",33399,2
33399,"I ordered these in white and my bottoms arrived with a green stain clearly visible through the plastic, and the tops had a pull in them.",33399,2
33399,So the quality control is absent as well.,33399,2
33399,At least the customer service was decent as they offered me a refund.,33399,2
33400,its too small.. i like the material.. but i didn't expect it to be super small..,33400,2
33401,Way too small!,33401,2
33402,These shoes were a big disappointment.,33402,2
33402,I'll keep them and see if wearing them longer will solve the issue I'm having - mostly because finding a decent pair of black sandals (flats) for work is near impossible.,33402,2
33402,The right show slides at the heel.,33402,2
33402,"So, when I'm walking, after about three steps, the heel is off to the inside of my foot and I have to stop to adjust it back under my foot.",33402,2
33402,"I've tried adjusting the heel strap, and nothing helps.",33402,2
33402,I think part of it is because there's virtually no arch support so nothing to keep the shoe from shifting.,33402,2
33402,"I don't have this issue with most of my flats, though I have had it in the past.",33402,2
33402,Too bad - a pretty shoe...love the way it looks.,33402,2
33403,Way too small I'm a size 6/8 and it was entirely too small on me..,33403,2
33403,It's cute to have on for a HOT second but not like you would probably actually like to wear it.,33403,2
33404,Very cheaply made.,33404,2
33404,Fell apart after 2 days.,33404,2
33405,the  gold color was dull on a few beads and there were 5 damaged beads out of 18 in package as pictured.,33405,2
33405,"The color of most of the beads was a dull/muted gold not a bright gold as pictured, disappointed in quality of beads",33405,2
33406,The clasp would not open and it broke.,33406,2
33406,Just O K for the cheap price!,33406,2
33406,Nello,33406,2
33407,The sizes are very different than what they are listed has.,33407,2
33408,The material is only bad quality polyester.,33408,2
33408,Not happy with this top.,33408,2
33409,Not what I expected.,33409,2
33409,Runs very small.,33409,2
33409,"I'm short,& it's not nearly as long as I hoped it'd be.",33409,2
33410,"can't wear this metal in my ear, but the color is pretty.",33410,2
33411,Fabric is too clingy constantly had static cling but the color was very nice and bright,33411,2
33412,The costume is NOT the same as the picture.,33412,2
33412,"The costume sits high in the waist, not the hips.",33412,2
33412,Also the skirt looks puffed out and does not look at all as the picture.,33412,2
33412,The belt looks cheap compared to the picture and she is not wearing the boot covers.,33412,2
33412,The picture is misleading.,33412,2
33412,Very disappointed.,33412,2
33412,The accessories and quality is adequate for what I paid.,33412,2
33412,I purchased nicer cuffs and the boots in my picture I also purchased.,33412,2
33412,The dress fits nothing like the picture and does not look nice.,33412,2
33413,A little bigger than expected,33413,2
33414,Turned my neck green in 2 days.,33414,2
33415,Wish it was true to size.,33415,2
33415,"Even after reading through countless reviews and selecting one I thought would fit, it didn't.",33415,2
33416,The angle of the slit is no where similar to that of the model.,33416,2
33416,"No matter what way I stand and no matter how I pull it, it doesn't even come close.",33416,2
33416,It's not even relatively tasteful.,33416,2
33416,Got this as an evening beach walking dress for a honeymoon.,33416,2
33416,Now I think it's just going to be a regular nightgown.,33416,2
33416,"Of course the item is see through and poor quality, but I docked stars for neither.",33416,2
33416,I was expecting that.,33416,2
33416,I docked stars for the item not reflecting the image depicted on the ad.,33416,2
33417,Haven't been able to use it.,33417,2
33417,The circle where the arrow go it got loose from the chain.,33417,2
33417,The bigger arrow was completely loose from the chain.,33417,2
33418,Not what it looks like.,33418,2
33418,Disappointed in width and materialbused.,33418,2
33419,Too small.,33419,2
33419,Too thin.,33419,2
33419,Seems like they are made for a child's foot.,33419,2
33419,"Unless you have very petite feet and looking for something very sheer in an unsoft material, steer clear.",33419,2
33420,did not fit me well,33420,2
33421,The Purple of the W logo is faded and looks nothing like the photo.,33421,2
33422,stretched out the first time I put it on and i'm a normal sized gal.,33422,2
33422,What's up w/that?,33422,2
33422,I'll be returning it.,33422,2
33423,"The top fit my tiny 10 year old, but the bottom was extremely small and very inappropriate!",33423,2
33424,It's ok,33424,2
33425,I like the dress but the fabric is too fair.,33425,2
33425,On the white stripes you can see through it pretty evidently.,33425,2
33425,"Which It makes it ok for a beach getaway, but not the city or store.",33425,2
33425,Specially in the underwear area (if you know what I mean),33425,2
33426,Way too small.,33426,2
33426,"Fabric and design seemed nice but would have expected the skirt to fan out more, not be so form fitting.",33426,2
33427,This didn't fit as expected and didn't provide any support.,33427,2
33428,"Within the first two hours of wearing this, the center circle of the flower on the bracelet AND the necklace fell off.",33428,2
33428,Small part choking hazard for younger sibling.,33428,2
33428,Only giving this two stars bc my daughter loves them despite the flaw.,33428,2
33428,Cheaply made product to fall apart so quickly.,33428,2
33428,Very disappointing.,33428,2
33429,The color is a brighter than what is shown in the picture.,33429,2
33429,It is also much bigger than I had anticipated.,33429,2
33429,I will be returning the shirt.,33429,2
33430,Very disappointed.,33430,2
33430,The photo very clearly shows long legs with cuffs.,33430,2
33430,Ours ended in just blue short legs.,33430,2
33431,Not bad material and good V-neck.,33431,2
33431,But very shirt top!,33431,2
33431,I don't like it!,33431,2
33432,Doesn't been well to fit arm.,33432,2
33432,Uncomfortable and do not see same pain relieving effects as I did with other copper bracelets,33432,2
33433,Not great quality.,33433,2
33433,Fits somehow big even though I ordered it based on the suggested size.,33433,2
33434,Runs way-small- couldn't even get them on over my butt.,33434,2
33434,Nice fabric and color.,33434,2
33435,Broke right away.,33435,2
33435,Returned it.,33435,2
33436,Too small not what I was expecting,33436,2
33437,"I'm no model, but this doesn't look anything like the picture.",33437,2
33438,The top was too large and did not support your breasts at all.,33438,2
33439,I ordered this cardigan and received a little bit different colored one than the one I ordered.,33439,2
33439,Before ordering I read some reviews saying that the product sizes came smaller than actual size in I am usually a medium so I ordered an extra large which fits perfect.,33439,2
33439,the material is very thin something to be worn in the summer would be perfect for.,33439,2
33439,even though I was given a different color its still nice and I still like it.,33439,2
33439,If you are going to order know that shipping is a little slow and to order two sizes bigger than your actual size.,33439,2
33440,Waaaaay too small!,33440,2
33440,For a male the sizes are completely off.,33440,2
33440,My husband wears usually small so we order a medium and that fit like an x-small!,33440,2
33440,If you need it on time make sure you order a big size because if not you'll end up with no sweater!,33440,2
33440,Sweater is cute,33440,2
33441,"False advertisement, carry on is not expandable",33441,2
33442,I bought it as a present to my girl friend.,33442,2
33442,"As I received, it was a disappointment.",33442,2
33442,The metal they used looks like plastic which makes it cheap looking.,33442,2
33442,"only the stones on the flower are clear and shining, rest are turbid and dull.",33442,2
33442,Also the stones on the leaves are not put in properly.,33442,2
33442,I m not sure give it to my GF.,33442,2
33443,Not comfortable.,33443,2
33443,Too small.,33443,2
33443,Couldn't wear it.,33443,2
33444,Got this for a friend to wear on St. Patrick's Day.,33444,2
33444,"It was larger than expected and the ""ladies cut"" was very boxy, not at all fitted.",33444,2
33444,She found something else to wear that day.,33444,2
33445,The pants and robe are very comfy but the shirt is too big no matter what size you order .,33445,2
33445,Overall too expensive for what you get.,33445,2
33446,"The sleeves and pocket are helpful, but the velcro is very weak and my son can pull it off quicker then I am able to put it on him.",33446,2
33446,I was hoping for something that was more difficult to remove.,33446,2
33446,I would not buy this item again.,33446,2
33447,They sent me two of the same badge and I'm missing one of them.,33447,2
33447,The box itself seems a bit beat up and the badges are a bit dirty.,33447,2
33447,The quality of the badges itself are good however.,33447,2
33448,COLOR was extremely inaccurate.,33448,2
33448,The blue top pictured for sale looks turquoise/bright blue- in reality the top is a pastel/powder blue.,33448,2
33448,"Very disappointed, because I wanted to use it for an Alice in Wonderland rave costume.",33448,2
33448,"Very sheer, even the back strip was just mesh so it did not hide a bra strap to be worn underneath.",33448,2
33448,I returned this top.,33448,2
33448,"Good idea, poor execution.",33448,2
33448,Two stars because the size chart was accurate.,33448,2
33448,Top fit as expected- follow the sizing chart.,33448,2
33449,These are tights not leggings the first time i wore them they got a run in them :(,33449,2
33450,Fits well..,33450,2
33450,Except the string for the shirt.. DIDNT come with the shirt..,33450,2
33451,Wasn't expecting anything spectacular but was bummed when mine arrived with a scratch and blue stain on it.,33451,2
33452,"I revived my dress today, I taught it's going to be same as picture, unfortunately it was not the color that I want, I have to return it back, I requested for return today same day but still I haven't heard from them.. :(",33452,2
33453,the top fit great but the bottoms were like 2 sizes too small.,33453,2
33454,I have to get the straps re sewed they are way to long i am little and have big boo s still i fall out everywhere,33454,2
33455,There were no invisible strapes included she can't wear the dress I have to return it I love the idea of same day shipping but I want the order to be complete this dress appears to be a pretty dress but I we will never know,33455,2
33456,The fit was waay big,33456,2
33457,Straps are WEIRDLY long and the dress is WAY too thin,33457,2
33458,Smaller than expected and the straps pulled out of the holes the first time I used it,33458,2
33459,I don't like the material; thought it was going to be cotton.,33459,2
33459,It wasn't.,33459,2
33459,More along the lines of a medical/surgical mask.,33459,2
33460,It.s pretty tight...it seems it would better fit a child.,33460,2
33460,It will give you a headache.,33460,2
33460,I basically wear it as a scrunchie..or to pull my hair out of the way for a few minutes in the house when straightening up.,33460,2
33461,Just did not look good on me.,33461,2
33462,"Loved the print, and fit except: The bust area was big enough to fit a double E!!",33462,2
33462,If the bust started midway to the navel it would have fit!!,33462,2
33462,I loved the suit and would have altered it is possible but there was no way to alter the bust without tearing it apart completely.,33462,2
33462,Too bad I would have done work but not total reconstruction.,33462,2
33463,TOO SMALL,33463,2
33464,Came broken.,33464,2
33464,I fixed it easily but was annoyed.,33464,2
33464,Since it didn't cost much I can't really complain.,33464,2
33465,Not fitted at all.,33465,2
33465,Looks like a potato sack.,33465,2
33465,Nothing like the picture.,33465,2
33465,Very thin.,33465,2
33465,I followed the size comments and ordered the next size up....I got a moomoo.,33465,2
33465,Not happy with this at all.,33465,2
33466,The rings don't fit well .... they are made solid but too small!,33466,2
33467,"course cotton material, not soft.",33467,2
33468,too big and not the exact color as picture,33468,2
33469,very cute for a teen,33469,2
33470,looks good BUT was to be to me in 2 days got it in 6  prime member unhappy with that,33470,2
33471,"You get what you pay for, right?",33471,2
33471,Saw the exact ones at the dollar store so that will give you an idea of the quality.,33471,2
33471,There were only about 4 different designs in total.,33471,2
33471,Might be good for a kid's party but a little on the chintzy side for our upcoming adult Mardi Gras get together.,33471,2
33471,"Oh well, I just wanted some on hand for people who missed the memo that it's a masquerade party and I guess these were affordable and better than nothing.",33471,2
33472,These are a b!,33472,2
33472,!tch to get the balls screwed back on.,33472,2
33472,"And the captive hoops aren't screw in, you have to push the ball in.",33472,2
33472,So frustrating.,33472,2
33472,I also hate that they're not put in by sizes.,33472,2
33473,The silicone rubs against the incision and could probably cause more harm than good since it could snag and cause it to pull.,33473,2
33473,"And they were too big, but maybe would have fit if I tried them on day 1 after surgery.",33473,2
33473,"I was at 4 weeks after baby, so they didn't provide any compression.",33473,2
33473,Item was returned due to these issues.,33473,2
33474,Runs a bit small.,33474,2
33474,Looks different online .,33474,2
33474,They were shorter also.,33474,2
33475,Too small so I gave it to my daughter.,33475,2
33476,"It says these are for lips nose and ear , I do not see how these would work for the lip or the nose .These were a really way to  long was going to use for an interview I had but it really bothered the inside of my nose , they went from one side to the other and there was no way I could wear it ..",33476,2
33476,I feel it was a waist of my time and money and I had nothing to replace it with and had to wear my stud to the interview..,33476,2
33477,Love the hat but quality is poor.,33477,2
33477,The American flag ink was smudged so you can't really make it out.,33477,2
33478,I REALLY wanted to like these earrings.,33478,2
33478,"But, they sort of ""hang"" wrong in my ears.",33478,2
33478,They are also kind of difficult to put on and take off.,33478,2
33478,They look cool - and would look a lot cooler if the screw head fit perfectly against my ear.,33478,2
33478,Too bad.,33478,2
33478,I have a hard time finding the right earrings and tend to stick with simple studs.,33478,2
33478,Would love to find something like this that works.,33478,2
33479,Not easy to use.,33479,2
33479,"Has small wire spring in recessed hole dies fit in, one popped out couldn't find it (small and black), now I need to use tape to keep the die from falling out.",33479,2
33479,I would have preferred to get something more expensive that was higher quality.,33479,2
33480,"Beautiful dress and would have really loved it, it the right color but it came damaged, so  I have to return it.",33480,2
33481,I needed to replace a linen shirt similar to this.,33481,2
33481,The armholes are small while the shirt is large.,33481,2
33481,It looks a little odd on.,33481,2
33482,very poor product!,33482,2
33483,"I would have returned it, but I tried it after 30 days.",33483,2
33483,"It's not bad quality, but the snaps wouldn't hold my stockings.",33483,2
33483,"I was really disappointed because I had spent money on a corset, and gotten myself all dolled up for my boyfriend.",33483,2
33484,"The straps slide so easily, it is not usable unless you tie the excess slack.",33484,2
33484,My daughter put it on and immediately the straps slid so loose that the backpack sagged.,33484,2
33484,It's like they put the straps in backwards.,33484,2
33484,Cute backpack though!,33484,2
33485,The sizes are running small on this item,33485,2
33486,"does not look like the image
color is different, no tie on pants in front like the image
hat has a split & tie in the back",33486,2
33487,This is see-through and not too flattering- but perhaps that's due to the color.,33487,2
33488,The material is nice.,33488,2
33488,I brought an xl and I am 5'3  the dress is really short.,33488,2
33488,It does not come to the knees how the picture shows.,33488,2
33488,Also the zipper broke when i tried it on.,33488,2
33488,So I had to spend money to getbthe zipper fixed.,33488,2
33489,Nice hat but all creased up,33489,2
33490,It's really cute but the waistline is very small..if your child is a bit chubby like mine then this outfit is a no no,33490,2
33491,Too short,33491,2
33492,I only Give It 2 Stars because the LEDs are really bright the remote control doesn't work An Inconvenient hassle to take out battery pack and it tried to switch colors without controller is also a pain,33492,2
33493,My son had a lot of fun with them for about a week and then the wheels started falling off.,33493,2
33494,Ear Mitts to small.,33494,2
33494,Had send them back.,33494,2
33495,I didn't get the blue that I wanted!,33495,2
33495,!,33495,2
33496,"The bodice of this dress was so awkward that although the rest of the dress was fine, we had to return it.",33496,2
33496,It looks as if someone stuffed tissue paper in the chest area.,33496,2
33496,"Overall, the material of the dress was a little stretchy, leading to a nice hug to the body, and came down slightly past the knee.",33496,2
33497,I guess I was a little rough on these shorts and they ripped super easily.,33497,2
33498,Was this size based on mini petite woman.,33498,2
33498,"I ordered an XL, my size, and barely could try this jacket on.",33498,2
33498,Sizes need  to be revised.,33498,2
33499,"Was very happy with the quality, but sizes run very small.",33499,2
33499,"Usually wear a small, will probably have to get a large",33499,2
33500,Stretched out.,33500,2
33501,"I'm 5'10"" and have a pretty average build.",33501,2
33501,I can fit into size L junior shirts with ease usually.,33501,2
33501,I order the large expecting the same.,33501,2
33501,It fits more a small!,33501,2
33501,Order minimum 2 sizes up unless buying for a child.,33501,2
33501,"It is very soft and would be comfortable, if it fit.",33501,2
33502,I ordered this top in the light green.,33502,2
33502,"I wanted to love it, the colors were exactly like the picture, but it was too HUGE.",33502,2
33502,"I'm 5'3"" and it was so long it fell past my knees.",33502,2
33502,"Also, it smelled like rotten fish.",33502,2
33502,The odor was so bad that even if the top had fit I wouldn't have been able to keep it.,33502,2
33503,Dont recommend.,33503,2
33503,It is ratty looking.,33503,2
33503,Not robust like picture and about 2 sizes too small.,33503,2
33504,"Close to being the right size, slightly see thru, super comfortable.",33504,2
33505,I ordered this shirt in my normal size after reading the measurements.,33505,2
33505,However it is sized at least 3 sizes too small.,33505,2
33505,If you order this in womens plus and want it to be comfy and roomy go up at least 3 sizes to get the right fit.,33505,2
33505,I am very disappointed and won't order this product again.,33505,2
33506,Too big,33506,2
33507,very pretty but you must order it 2 sized bigger for it to fit like the picture,33507,2
33508,Stitching on side mesh pocket fell out the first day of using.,33508,2
33508,Very dissapointing as my daughter likes to carry her water bottles to school in the side pocket.,33508,2
33508,Fabric is a little thin as well.,33508,2
33508,Cute design and straps seem sturdy though.,33508,2
33509,These are better material then the fruit of a loom but run small & could be softer cotton.,33509,2
33510,I didn't get the second set of front wheels?,33510,2
33510,!,33510,2
33511,It was too small from the top and too big from the bottom and it is also transparent.,33511,2
33511,I bought a small and it looks like a medium..,33511,2
33512,Not as nice as the more expensive brand and it's quite light colored.,33512,2
33512,My husband prefers the qalo brand over this.,33512,2
33513,Runs very small.,33513,2
33513,Not boxy or flowy as shown.,33513,2
33513,Very DISAPPOINTED!,33513,2
33513,NOT oversized at all.,33513,2
33513,Would fit a 10-12.,33513,2
33514,I guess the skirt is fine but is not the one shown on the picture,33514,2
33515,"These are beautiful on the photo, but do not fit as expected on arrival.",33515,2
33515,This item is more of a muscle T rather then a racer back tank top.,33515,2
33516,The material wasn't long enough for a woman 5'7.,33516,2
33516,The were comfortable and felt perfect she said but when she bent over the waist slid down like a plumbers butt.,33516,2
33516,So they're basically useless and I should've returned them but I never got around to it.,33516,2
33516,Quality seems good and the designs are nice but just aren't true to size.,33516,2
33517,"I purchased these for my boyfriend who is 6'1"", 165 lbs, and waist size 32.",33517,2
33517,I ordered a size small for him based on the sizing chart and other reviewers recommendations.,33517,2
33517,"When they arrived he was initially unhappy with the color, as they appear far more yellow than khaki.",33517,2
33517,"However, he tried them on and said they were comfortable so he would be fine wearing them.",33517,2
33517,"The shorts are very long, and they reached halfway past his knees, but for some reason the crotch area was very tight, almost as if they were made for a woman's physique... Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously.",33517,2
33517,(Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.),33517,2
33517,It was a bit ridiculous how much was on display!,33517,2
33517,"I would have chalked it up to the sizing being off, and ordered him a larger size in another color, but I had ordered my dad a pair of the same shorts in an extra large and he had the exact same problem.",33517,2
33517,The shorts fit correctly everywhere except for the crotch area.,33517,2
33517,"The length, waist, and butt area fit fine, but you'd have to be a woman to wear these and not turn a few heads!",33517,2
33517,Yikes!,33517,2
33517,"Unfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.",33517,2
33517,"As an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on.",33517,2
33517,"Because of this, I aim to leave good, informative reviews for others!",33517,2
33517,"If you found my review helpful, please do me a favor and mark it 'Helpful' below!",33517,2
33517,:),33517,2
33518,bad quality material,33518,2
33519,I was very disappointed with these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics as they were very uncomfortable in my shoes.,33519,2
33519,They raised my toes up so high that they rubbed against my shoe and it was quite painful.,33519,2
33519,I only kept them on about 2 hours as that is all I could stand.,33519,2
33519,"Unfortunately,  they are going back.",33519,2
33519,"Oh well, the search is still on....",33519,2
33520,looks nothing like the picture and is very cheap,33520,2
33521,Too large.,33521,2
33521,Not a regular size 6.,33521,2
33521,I bought a size smaller hoping that would fit and that one is too large as well.,33521,2
33521,Make sure you go down 2 sizes.,33521,2
33522,They are beautiful shoes but orders two pair and both pairs were way to small!!,33522,2
33522,My daughter loved them and so did I wish the sizing be was better.,33522,2
33523,Oddly made.,33523,2
33523,Not for tall women.,33523,2
33523,"I ordered a size up from recommended one, but the bust is too small for my C sisters and the thick pads are not removable.",33523,2
33523,"The straps were short, and the drape was awkward.",33523,2
33523,Returned it,33523,2
33524,"I ordered a medium, and even though all the panties in the set were labelled medium, the panties were not uniform in size.",33524,2
33524,There was a 1/2 - 2 inch difference in the waistbands of each panty.,33524,2
33524,"One of the pairs fit great, and I loved them, but since they were all labelled M, I had no idea what size was the true M so I didn't bother wasting my time ordering another set.",33524,2
33525,Wayyy too big.,33525,2
33526,"Very poor quality, picture quality were not reflective of actual product.",33526,2
33527,"It's pretty obvious the item picture is just an indication of what's on the shirt, and not an actual shirt.",33527,2
33527,When the item came the print was not very crisp and flaking off.,33527,2
33527,"I wasn't terribly surprised, but definitely disappointed.",33527,2
33527,"If you're looking to get one of these I'd suggest trying a different vendor, who has an actual picture of the shirt.",33527,2
33527,"They left a note in the package that there was 'residue' from the curing process, which there was.",33527,2
33527,From what I can see the curing didn't go great.,33527,2
33527,"I'd return it, but it was a last minute gift.",33527,2
33527,"Besides, this type of thing should be right the first time, especially considering that they knew.",33527,2
33528,I loved the looks of this top and went by the size chart but must donate it.,33528,2
33528,A smaller lady will enjoy it!,33528,2
33528,"Just so  you know, I wear a 36C bra and am a long tall Sally.",33528,2
33529,This is not very well made at all.,33529,2
33529,We have only had it for a few days and it already has bends and marks in the plastic.,33529,2
33529,"I would highly recommend going with another product, this will not last.",33529,2
33530,little bigger than expected.,33530,2
33531,"Runs VERY small, order at least 2 sizes up.",33531,2
33531,"I usually wear a small and I ordered this once in size small (bursting out of it), returned it, ordered a medium (very little difference), returned it, ordered a large and was satisfied enough to give up and just not return it.",33531,2
33531,The top is pretty cool but  the bottom is really ugly and weird (in terms of the print)--it looks like I've paired two mismatching pieces until I turn around...,33531,2
33531,"The bottoms also are a really tight fit, even in size large.",33531,2
33532,Just received this today.,33532,2
33532,The hinge is very loose.,33532,2
33532,It isn't running and the back plate is dented badly.,33532,2
33532,Wish I would have purchase a different style.,33532,2
33533,The length is the same as a Carter's 9-month footed jammie - width is probably accurate for a 12-month old?,33533,2
33533,Doesn't do much for my long and thin 8 month old...can probably only wear them for a couple of weeks.,33533,2
33534,Looks better in the picture.,33534,2
33534,not really pleased with this item,33534,2
33535,Looks cheap.,33535,2
33535,Did not fit right at all.,33535,2
33536,Was supposed to lace up in back!!!,33536,2
33536,This one is open with criss cross lines!!!,33536,2
33536,!the black and white ones,33536,2
33537,"It fit, however, the snapping part underneath felt a little tight and seem to rub me to where it hurt at times.",33537,2
33538,I purchased two of these and the sizes were inconsistent.,33538,2
33538,Quality is poor.,33538,2
33538,"The price is inexpensive, certainly.",33538,2
33538,Slow delivery from China.,33538,2
33538,One might consider this a waste of money but it was not much money wasted.,33538,2
33539,There's a seam running across the mid-section on the front and back.,33539,2
33539,I didn't like it so I returned,33539,2
33540,The color is more of a peach color instead of pink.,33540,2
33540,It wasn't actually what I wanted.,33540,2
33541,"I'm 5' 7"" 160 pounds and according to the chart the QUEEN size should have fit, but they were way too small.",33541,2
33541,Too tight and too short.,33541,2
33542,Very thin and vinyl is very cheap looking and feeling,33542,2
33543,Runs REALLY small!!,33543,2
33543,I ordered a medium and should have gotten an extra large.,33543,2
33543,"I am 5'2"" and 135lbs, it's small, I gave it to my sister in law who is 5' and weighs 95lbs and it fits her perfectly.",33543,2
33543,Order 2 sizes up!,33543,2
33543,But is well made and good material and arrived in 2 days as expected.,33543,2
33544,"Material is quite inferior, the fit wasn't what I expected.",33544,2
33544,Very cheap and thin material.,33544,2
33545,Looks exactly like a scrub top from the front.,33545,2
33545,Not a terrible shirt but I wouldn't recommend it,33545,2
33546,This should be sized as a child's item.,33546,2
33546,Extremely small.,33546,2
33547,Ok for a child or young girl,33547,2
33548,I purchased the black leggings by themselves first to make sure I liked them.,33548,2
33548,They worked fine--I still wear them regularly.,33548,2
33548,I thought the multi-color pack of 6 would be of equal quality but they are not.,33548,2
33548,I went through 3 leggings in 2 hours each and never even left the house before snagging a run and ruining them.,33548,2
33548,I wasn't playing rough or anything.,33548,2
33548,Pantyhose lasts longer than these did.,33548,2
33549,Lol got large looks like it's made for a child.,33549,2
33549,Giving away.,33549,2
33550,These run very small.,33550,2
33550,Better order a size bigger.,33550,2
33551,"fit is small, order up at least one size,  useless.",33551,2
33552,The buttons don't fit through the holes,33552,2
33553,Scratched right away when tried to pull off the cardboard covering the surface.,33553,2
33554,The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames that I don't like.,33554,2
33555,"The golden watch started turning silver color in less than a month, so now it looks old because it's so faded.",33555,2
33556,It arrived earlier than expected which was nice.,33556,2
33556,But I have two complaints.,33556,2
33556,"It smells awful, and it is more of a big piece of gauze than the one I picked up at the local surplus store.",33556,2
33556,This one has no weight to it at all and the space in the weave is huge.,33556,2
33556,I'm glad it was only a few dollars.,33556,2
33557,Cute but way way too small.,33557,2
33557,I felt like I was trying to squeeze into my 8 year old sister's dress,33557,2
33558,THE LEATHER TIP ON THE BELT IS NOT PROPERLY SEWN AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THREAD THRU PANT BELT LOOPS.,33558,2
33559,NOT A SWEATER DRESS.,33559,2
33559,It's an ok and rather see through fabric.,33559,2
33559,"I like the cut, don't mind the fit but don't call it a sweater dress.",33559,2
33559,Nothing sweater about it.,33559,2
33560,Cheap shirt!,33560,2
33561,"It's made of good materials, however the fit is awkward and bunches up in the pocket areas...also has shrunken considerably after a few washes making it somewhat unwearable outside the house.",33561,2
33562,Was cute.. but unfortunately the clasp broke after only a couple of wearings.,33562,2
33563,Too small it fit like belly/crop top shirt.,33563,2
33564,Not the best quality and really really small.,33564,2
33564,Can't ask too much for the price.,33564,2
33564,I would have rather paid more for a better quality and size.,33564,2
33565,Ordered the largest size and it was still too small.,33565,2
33565,Uhhhhh,33565,2
33566,Gave it to Good Will,33566,2
33567,"Though it fit as expected, and I actually really liked the romper, the straps over my chest were completely see-through so I had to return it.",33567,2
33567,There were also some faults in the stitching which is why I made the ultimate decision to return it.,33567,2
33568,This dress appears to be nicely made for the price and the fabric is soft and lightweight.,33568,2
33568,"I am 5'2"" and a size 4/6 in a dress this style.",33568,2
33568,"I followed the guide and bought a medium, which fit well except it is significantly shorter than I expected.",33568,2
33568,I wanted a dress which would fall an inch or two below my knee.,33568,2
33568,"The description for this dress states that the medium is 41"" long from the highest point of the shoulder, which would have worked for me.",33568,2
33568,"However the dress is actually 37"" long and just comes to the top of my knee.",33568,2
33568,"I know that is how it looks on the model, and what other taller reviews reported, but given my short height and the claim that it is 41"" long, I ordered it.",33568,2
33568,I am returning it.,33568,2
33568,What a disappointment!,33568,2
33569,Far too small,33569,2
33570,My cat is almost at the top of my hat.,33570,2
33570,It is in a weird location.,33570,2
33570,Luckily the stitching is of such poor quality that it will be easy to take it off and relocate it.,33570,2
33571,"It was a tad too short and when I pulled it down the zipper popped open, so the zipper is broke.",33571,2
33572,My 5' daughter has same suit-great quality but I ordered a size up from usual size.,33572,2
33572,So tiny-short could barely get up on!,33572,2
33572,"I'm 5' 5"" so it's a PETITE",33572,2
33573,See through,33573,2
33574,Very sheer and thin.,33574,2
33575,It came with only one of the cuffs.,33575,2
33575,The ribbon attached to the one cuff also came off as soon as I tried it on.,33575,2
33575,I loved the overall lingerie outfit.,33575,2
33575,It ties very nicely around my body.,33575,2
33575,My problem is that a big part of why I liked this outfit were the cuffs.,33575,2
33575,They would have been a really cute touch.,33575,2
33576,When worn correctly it's hard to see the logo plus it is made in China,33576,2
33577,Very small for XL,33577,2
33578,Cheap looking but I guess you get what you pay for!,33578,2
33579,Completely see through and the picture is not the same as I received looks black and is navy blue the bodice is not solid black it is bright orange.,33579,2
33579,Disappointed,33579,2
33580,"It's cute, but it's not the greatest material and runs EXTREMELY SMALL.",33580,2
33580,I'm usually a medium on top and bottom and I literally got stuck trying to put the bottoms on and my boobs (which are not large) were almost completely sticking out.,33580,2
33580,If you order this bikini go at least one if not two sizes larger.,33580,2
33580,Definitely returning.,33580,2
33581,"wrong size sent, colors are somewhat different than the photo (not as clear, bright).",33581,2
33581,Shrinks in wash considerably,33581,2
33582,Very low waisted.,33582,2
33583,"Band is good quality, it is sized smaller than 22mm, but that was clearly described.",33583,2
33583,"My concern is the pins are of vet poor quality, both have failed.",33583,2
33583,I am looking for new pins now.,33583,2
33584,It looked really nice but I guess I should of sowed an extra line through it because it came apart before I could actually wear it.,33584,2
33585,It was bigger and blingier (is that a word) than it seemed in the picture.,33585,2
33586,It fits nothing like the picture and runs small.,33586,2
33587,The material is super shiny.,33587,2
33587,"I didn't get that from the picture, so it makes it look super dressy.",33587,2
33587,"Not necessarily a bad thing,but the style of the dress is kinda casual.",33587,2
33587,I find it rather difficult to style with shoes.,33587,2
33587,I haven't returned it.,33587,2
33587,Guess I'm waiting to see if i can figure it out...,33587,2
33588,Very thin and poorly made.,33588,2
33588,"Can be used as a costume, Not what I expected but I will be a gypsy for halloween ...I guess",33588,2
33589,Not real happy with it.,33589,2
33589,My grandaughter has only used it less than a week and the zipper broke.,33589,2
33590,Shipped fast.,33590,2
33590,Very pretty ring for what you pay.,33590,2
33590,I fell in love with it.,33590,2
33590,"But within 2 days of wearing it, I have had two stones fall out and the other stones are not placed correctly and are lopsided and looks like if I kept wearing it, all the stones would fall out.",33590,2
33590,"Would order again, but I'm afraid the stones will fall out of the new one.",33590,2
33591,Based on previous reviews I ordered a size up and it was huge!,33591,2
33591,I reordered my actual size and it was still too big.,33591,2
33591,"It runs large, people... Not small.",33591,2
33591,"Also, it's a heavy dress.",33591,2
33591,There's a lot of material so be careful if wearing for an outdoor wedding on a hot summer day.,33591,2
33591,It'll make you sweat.,33591,2
33591,It's a shame it didn't work out.,33591,2
33591,It's a beautiful style.,33591,2
33592,SOOOO disappointed!,33592,2
33592,Whoever heard of a sweatshirt that needs to be hand washed and dried flat!,33592,2
33592,Really?,33592,2
33592,The fit is boxy and the sleeves are too full and too long with the wrist cuffs too wide.,33592,2
33592,And the material is thin...definitely not what I think of when I think sweatshirt.,33592,2
33592,Definitely do NOT recommend this.,33592,2
33592,Will be sending it back.,33592,2
33592,"(FYI...this refers to the black/white check patterned sweatshirt...not the hoodies, which got great reviews.)",33592,2
33593,The color looks more of an army green in the picture but is actually brown.,33593,2
33593,Not very happy with this purchase,33593,2
33594,I actually really like this product but the facet that it broke off on the second day into my 2 week trip has me really disappointed,33594,2
33595,wayyyy to small.,33595,2
33595,I purchased threee in a medium and i have to give them away,33595,2
33596,"Its a pretty piece of round fabric, but I would never use it as a beach throw.",33596,2
33596,The material is very thin and sheer.,33596,2
33596,Could be used as a tapestry I guess...,33596,2
33597,Wish it was cottons,33597,2
33598,The fabric was very cheap.,33598,2
33599,The fabric is soft and the product itself seems fairly durable.,33599,2
33599,"Over all, I was not impressed when I saw the pants though.",33599,2
33599,"I ordered 12 months and the pants are huge, they would probably fit a 2 year old.",33599,2
33599,There were also a lot of typos on the front of the pants.,33599,2
33599,"The print reads as follows: FIFTH

Would not recommend this product, especially for the price and length of time it took to arrive.",33599,2
33600,This dress was WAY too small.,33600,2
33600,Very hard for me to believe this is Plus-Size.,33600,2
33600,I read the few reviews that were listed before deciding to purchase the XXL.I am normally a size 14.,33600,2
33600,The dress was EXTREMELY too tight and clung to EVERY imperfection.,33600,2
33600,"I think the idea/style of the dress is nice, but the sizing was way off.",33600,2
33601,Not as pictured.,33601,2
33601,"Still cool, but not what is advertised",33601,2
33602,The top didn't fit well.,33602,2
33603,The shirt is a super cute lightweight material.,33603,2
33603,"It fits slightly larger than i was expecting, probably should have went down a size and it is not quite ""red"" as it appears in the picture it is almost a light pink color.",33603,2
33603,It is very hard to find ladies IH tanks and i am satisfied however it's not quite what i expectedand of the words are printed upside down,33603,2
33604,Lovely ring.,33604,2
33604,Until a stone fell out after 3 days.,33604,2
33604,"I've taken it off to do dishes, shower, and sleep, but I still lost a side stone NOT EVEN a whole week after I bought it.",33604,2
33604,:(  Such a disappointment.,33604,2
33605,"Cute ,but somewhat small.",33605,2
33606,I highly doubt this is leather.,33606,2
33606,Maybe the very back of the belt is leather not clear through.,33606,2
33606,I shouldn't have bought it and will never ever buy this again.,33606,2
33606,The black is coming off after a couple weeks.,33606,2
33606,Last leather belt I had lasted 10 years.,33606,2
33606,Clearly I didn't know what I was buying and clearly need to buy an expensive quality belt next time.,33606,2
33606,Guess it will go in the landfill soon like all other cheap clothing.,33606,2
33606,My bad.,33606,2
33607,Cheap looking plastic purse.,33607,2
33607,If I'm caught in the rain I won't have to worry.,33607,2
33607,Now I know what synthetic leather is.,33607,2
33607,Ugh!,33607,2
33608,Very small.,33608,2
33609,Nice dress but way too small.,33609,2
33609,I ordered a small and I'm only 5 ft and pretty petit but I couldn't get this past my thighs let alone the zipper didn't stand a chance.,33609,2
33609,I'm thinking maybe even a large,33609,2
33610,This is basically a sausage casing.,33610,2
33610,"I have previously purchased these exact same shorties in the same exact size small and they were fine, but this particular one was SO small.",33610,2
33610,"Since I cant find these anywhere its back to the drawing board, but the fabric is good and the shorts hold up well and are perfect under dresses when you don't want any thigh rubbing and need a little tummy firming.",33610,2
33611,"Scarf is as shown in picture,  but couldn't find any label showing made from silk, does not feel like silk, neither.",33611,2
33612,Tight fit in the bust area,33612,2
33613,It was ok,33613,2
33614,Runs very small.,33614,2
33615,"It does not fit as pictured, it's much shorter and tight around the waist.",33615,2
33616,A few things I encountered.,33616,2
33616,1.,33616,2
33616,"I put this on and immediately about two inches of seams on one side came undone, 2.",33616,2
33616,It was a bit big and the fit is super strange.,33616,2
33616,"I got a S/M and the ""corset"" like top is not structured at all and doesn't offer any shape.",33616,2
33616,3.,33616,2
33616,If you are long-waisted it will be only a few inches covering your backside so plan accordingly.,33616,2
33616,I will be returning due to the split seams and poor construction.,33616,2
33617,T-shirt material.,33617,2
33617,Arms are very small,33617,2
33618,Sizes not all the same.,33618,2
33619,Too small U wear size 8 the large is very small,33619,2
33620,Super cute BUT Runs small I am 130lbs and it was a S .. it was for my cosplay and it fit sorta.. but I had to move a certain way while in costume because it was tight on my arms also No way I could roll my sleeves up and my shoulders would pull the back tight...,33620,2
33620,I feared I might rip it.,33620,2
33620,I did contact the seller and they did respond and fast .... but I had to pay shipping to return it.... and wait on them to receive it ..... and then send me another.... taking 2-3 MONTHS.... No thanks!,33620,2
33620,I just made it work and took the seams out and used my sewing machine to loosen it up.,33620,2
33620,I mean The quality was good and it was cute!,33620,2
33620,he did respond fast but it was more an XS AND to get another replacement was too much,33620,2
33621,Waaay too small.,33621,2
33622,Kind of dissapointing because it doesnt stay up.,33622,2
33622,"I have long hair, & I was going to do a Kakashi Cosplay, but it left a huge gap where my nose is, and did not stay up.",33622,2
33622,"Also, the Velcro in the back in very cheap, and my hair always got in the way of being able to connect it.",33622,2
33623,The images are rather dull and difficult to see.,33623,2
33623,"Of the three pairs, only 2 were correct image and size.",33623,2
33623,"The 3rd pair was mismatched,  one of them was the wrong size and the other had a faulty screw on back/didn't fit the plug.",33623,2
33624,too thin and flimsy but its cute,33624,2
33625,"After 1 week, it fades ALOT
I do not recommend, unless you're wearing this only once..",33625,2
33626,very thin and cheaply made.,33626,2
33626,material is thinner than a teeshirt.,33626,2
33626,too expensive for the quality.,33626,2
33626,probably won't wear it again.,33626,2
33627,You get what you pay for.,33627,2
33628,I ordered this shirt in XXL and it fits like a large.,33628,2
33628,The item is nice but the sizing is way off.,33628,2
33629,Wasn't comfy.,33629,2
33630,I live the shirt and how it fits.,33630,2
33630,Form fitting as expected with the slim style.. but I wish they had payed a little more attention on fastening the buttons and stiching the seams because they're was a few holes sure to not finishing the stiching by the collar and a few buttons are about to fall off before I even wore the shirt.. only reason why I did not give it a 4 star..,33630,2
33631,Reading the other reviews I knew these jeans would be really small so I measured my waist and hips and looked at the sizing chart.,33631,2
33631,Unfortunately the sizing chart showed even numbered sizes and the jeans were selling in odd numbered sizes.,33631,2
33631,So it said I would measure at a 10 and I ended up ordering an 11 thinking the 95%cotton would shrink.,33631,2
33631,"My hips measure at 39 and my waist at 30, I am 5'3 and I normally wear a size 4 jean.",33631,2
33631,I have a bit of room in my waist at a size 11 and they are long enough to fold over a couple of inches at my ankles.,33631,2
33631,They did not shrink hardly at all.,33631,2
33631,Over all I am happy with them but I think I would try for a size 9 if I were to order again.,33631,2
33631,"As for the color, it is spot on!",33631,2
33631,Update: so a few months later I had lost a couple of pounds and I needed these for a photo shoot and the 11 ended up being way too big.,33631,2
33631,I went ahead and ordered a size 7 which fit great.,33631,2
33631,After wearing I noticed they stretch out a lot.,33631,2
33631,"However, be aware that although the listing (for me) said *free returns*, the company will NOT honor that.",33631,2
33631,I went back and forth with them and they gave me some BS answer about why they wouldnt even though my size and color did say free returns.,33631,2
33631,Needless to say they are not trustworthy if you run into a problem.,33631,2
33631,I will not ever order from them again.,33631,2
33631,Buyer Beware.,33631,2
33632,Great bracelet for the price but straps do not lay on your wrist as shown in picture and closure broke when trying it on.,33632,2
33633,The top is cup smaller than expected,33633,2
33634,"Lovely but way too long for my 5'4"" frame",33634,2
33635,Didn't like the fit.,33635,2
33635,Great color though.,33635,2
33636,This product doesn't work for me doesn't help me sweat at all,33636,2
33637,The suit came extremely fast!,33637,2
33637,"(Reasoning for the 2 stars given)

33662,I wear a size L. I ordered size xl and it fits like a small.,33662,2
33663,Ordered a large but its probably designed for a woman with a short mid section cause it barely covers the belly button.,33663,2
33663,I haven't even worn it yet.,33663,2
33663,But for the price I guess its worth it.,33663,2

33673,I normally fit a size 10-12 (depending on designer) with my athletic build.,33673,2
33673,"So I guess if you have similar measurements, get a plus size like XXL for swimwear because the sizes are off.",33673,2
33673,I really appreciated the companys ability to compensate me for the loss and would recommend clothing that is not snug dependent ( ie swimwear).,33673,2
33674,I really do not like this all that much.,33674,2

33676,Very upsetting!,33676,2
33677,Opening of purse too small,33677,2
33678,First of all when I took it out the box it smells so moldy and musty I can hardly breathe I'm trying to air it out as we speak I really don't want to have to have it cleaned before it needs to be worn she hasn't tried it on yet but that's because it's so unbelievably smelly that we can't even bear to put it on,33678,2

33680,They are too thin and they feel very cheaply made.,33680,2
33680,Also the pockets are spaced too far apart and make your butt look really wide.,33680,2
33680,"If you really want to purchase these pants, I would definitely suggest you wear them under a longer tunic or dress.",33680,2
33680,And one good thing is that the waistband is well constructed and do feel like a the waistband of a real pair of stretchy jeans.,33680,2
33680,They were comfortable too.,33680,2

33683,But then...,33683,2

33712,I then ordered the Large hoping it would fit perfectly.,33712,2
33712,I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two because from what I could tell they fit exactly the same (a sign of how cheaply made it is).,33712,2
33713,To short in the torso.,33713,2

33715,I don't know the way it's made I couldn't see wearing it to a class ever.,33715,2
33715,The material is super soft though and that on it's own is a HUGE plus.,33715,2
33715,But I also found that the legs like to ride up around the ankles.,33715,2

33716,This product came and according to customer descriptions was not at all what I was expecting.,33716,2
33716,It has a velvet top part and cheap shiny skirt attached.,33716,2
33716,The bands are thick and bulky not tight and sleek like in pictures on page.,33716,2
33716,The top is not even in the back and bunches up.,33716,2

33717,It fit well but the look was not great.,33717,2
33717,The bow looked nothing like the big drooping bow in the picture but rather like a straight thin bow tie.,33717,2
33717,The material keeps riding up the hips.,33717,2
33717,I was really excited about the classy looking dress in the picture and on receipt of the item experienced acute disappointment.,33717,2
33718,2 stars only because I was refunded all of my money after some hassle.,33718,2
33718,But the Snow White does not look like the picture.,33718,2

33723,Don't bother.,33723,2
33723,The colors were completely off from the photo.,33723,2
33723,(I ordered the soft green.,33723,2
33723,What came was turquoise.),33723,2
33723,The heart design is too prominent- really stands out in a corny way.,33723,2
33723,And the blouse just kind of hangs there.,33723,2
33723,The whole thing looks nothing like the blouse shown in the photo of the model.,33723,2
33724,"it was too small for my daughter, and also too short to wear correctly--needs to have another 5-6 inches to have the waist fold the proper way",33724,2
33725,I searched everywhere for an opal like belly ring.,33725,2
33725,This is WAY too big.,33725,2
33725,It looks funny on and gets in the way.,33725,2
33725,The gems are pretty though.,33725,2
33726,"very pretty case however not protective at all, dropped it once and my screen shattered.",33726,2

33728,They are clear but they're quite obvious.,33728,2
33729,"Runs small and the color is actually melon/salmon, not red as described.",33729,2
33729,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and needless to say, it wasn't the red I was looking for.",33729,2
33730,The dimensions are given incorrectly!,33730,2
33730,"The ring is way smaller than 1.5X1 in, it's about 1x0.5, and I expected a big ring.",33730,2

33730,"It's minor, but still noticeable, and I couldn't clean it.",33730,2
33731,So disappointed with this item.,33731,2
33731,The material doesn't give and it's cut too small.,33731,2
33731,"Also, there was a stain on the front of the item.",33731,2
33731,Had to return it.,33731,2
33732,This is a cute set and fits nicely.,33732,2
33732,"However for what it is, it's crazy overpriced.",33732,2
33732,Rayon and spandex pjs should not cost $100.,33732,2
33732,I hope that they hold up for a long time!,33732,2
33733,Sending it back.,33733,2
33733,Got it in yellow and the lining is see through.,33733,2
33733,It's also too tight for my liking.,33733,2
33734,Very cheap looking.,33734,2
33734,The items arrived bent and disfigured because they were shipped in a plain mailer with no padding to protect them!,33734,2
33734,Total waste of a few bucks.,33734,2
33734,Were intended as a gift for my niece but instead I threw them out.,33734,2
33735,So normally i am a large size.,33735,2
33735,In this case after reading the other reviews I had to order a XXL since it runs smaller.,33735,2
33735,The vest and the blazer fit just fine.,33735,2
33735,The only problem were the pants.,33735,2
33735,I am i not a skinny guy.,33735,2
33735,The pants really felt two sizes too small.,33735,2
33735,Best to get the XXXXL pants with the XXL blazer and vest.,33735,2
33735,Given the size chart that they put up the pants i thought were gonna be 40in waist where as they felt like 36.,33735,2
33735,So be warned.,33735,2
33735,The pants are smaller so if you do order it order 4 times the size for pants,33735,2
33736,Shirt fits very small and could not be worn.,33736,2
33737,Very poor quality shirt; made out of cheap material.,33737,2
33737,Was very disappointed.,33737,2
33738,The quality was lacking on this belt.,33738,2
33738,The outline of the fabric was poorly cut and the rhinestones were poorly stitched on.,33738,2
33739,Like a toy.,33739,2
33739,My daughter said it''s a shame and she is not going to wear it.,33739,2
33740,I looked at a lot of these phone cases because some of them had a kiss mark and a high heel on them and I didn't like that.,33740,2
33740,I just wanted the wine glass and that's how the picture was so I ordered it from this seller.,33740,2
33740,Imagine my surprise and disgust when I penned the package and saw the two things I did not want on it.,33740,2
33740,"Also the ""wine""  fills up the glass halfway in the picture and it's barely a quarter of the way.",33740,2
33740,The only good thing I have to say is that it was delivered a week and a half before it said it would be.,33740,2
33740,But that just means I was disappointed sooner.,33740,2
33741,Im skinny and this dress is not flattering.,33741,2
33741,It acentuates every curve and roll you have.,33741,2
33742,REALLY SMALL,33742,2
33743,It wasn't what I expected.,33743,2
33743,They look like out of space glasses.,33743,2
33743,Not stylish at all,33743,2
33744,I've gotten lots of compliments on my leggings but they are too small for me to wear comfortably.,33744,2
33744,I'm 5ft 8 and 145lbs.,33744,2
33744,They are too short so I only wear them with tall boots.,33744,2
33744,They are also pretty see-through so I would suggest wearing underwear to match your skin tone or none at all since you can easily see any underwear line unless it's a thong.,33744,2
33745,These pants are cheap and fall down easily.,33745,2
33745,All day long I have to keep pulling them up so I don't have a saggy crotch from the pants sliding down.,33745,2
33745,Besides being really soft and stretchy these pants are terrible.,33745,2
33745,The material will surely pill on the seam along the thighs.,33745,2
33745,I asked about being able to wear these under the belly of you are not really showing yet and the seller said that would work perfectly fine.,33745,2
33745,I can assure you that you can't unless you roll down the top of the pant significantly and that will make the sagging case worse.,33745,2
33745,As for being see-through as I have read other comments and questions I found no issues with opaqueness.,33745,2
33745,If you are very plus size then maybe they can get sheer but I really don't think this happens much.,33745,2
33745,Anyways you get what you pay for here.,33745,2
33746,I almost always wear a large.,33746,2
33746,"I am 5'4, size 12, and 175 lbs.",33746,2
33746,I bought a medium because of the length.,33746,2
33746,Did not want it to fit like a dress.,33746,2
33746,The length fit exactly like it appears That was great.,33746,2
33746,"However, the neck does not hug like it does in the pic.",33746,2
33746,It sits very loose.,33746,2
33746,"Also, was not happy with the quality of the material for $22.",33746,2
33746,It was rather thin.,33746,2
33746,I've paid under $20 for other tunics and have been pleased with the material.,33746,2
33746,I recommend A&D for quality.,33746,2
33746,Will not purchase this brand again.,33746,2
33747,It was too big.,33747,2
33747,I didn't like how it looked on me.,33747,2
33748,"Top was really pretty and soft, unfortunately  the extra large was way too small.",33748,2
33748,It seems to run about 2 sizes smaller.,33748,2
33748,I am 5'6 and 170 pounds.,33748,2
33748,It was way too tight and showed everything.,33748,2
33749,Too small.,33749,2
33749,The sleeves are too short and the shirt barely comes to my waist.,33749,2
33749,Nice thick material though,33749,2
33750,Too shiny looks cheap,33750,2
33751,"Pretty cheap, good concept.",33751,2
33752,"Love the print, love the feel, love the style.",33752,2
33752,I normally wear a L bottom.,33752,2
33752,And an XL top.,33752,2
33752,The XL top fit me like a S/M.,33752,2
33752,The pants (XL) were tight and short.,33752,2
33752,Quite disappointed.,33752,2
33752,"If you wear M, order XL.",33752,2
33753,came broken!,33753,2
33754,Looks nothing like the picture advertised will be returning.,33754,2
33754,Better off buying costume jewelry at a local retailer for half the cost.,33754,2
33755,"Very pretty, came with a bent part, tried to straighten a little---broke immediately.",33755,2
33755,Super cheap metal.,33755,2
33755,Never got to wear.,33755,2
33755,"Too bad, very nice to look at.",33755,2
33756,To small,33756,2
33757,followed size chart and a size small.,33757,2
33757,"good idea on design, but really doesn't work well.",33757,2
33757,the pouch or flap should be able to hold 'it' in without popping out when not desired.,33757,2
33758,"it doesn't look that small on the picture, its like for baby...I don't even bother to return it.",33758,2
33759,"The color is the same, but  is not something you can use to go out,  that is my pijamas cabinet!",33759,2
33760,this bracelet broke the first time I wore it.,33760,2
33760,the clasp is not strong enough,33760,2
33761,It's too small and cheap quality.,33761,2
33761,"The color is more of an antique rose, not the coffee color I expected.",33761,2
33761,I'm returning it.,33761,2
33762,"The pendent is so beautifully made, but the necklace was crap and broke after the first time I wore it.",33762,2
33763,"Disappointed in the size, too small.",33763,2
33764,They were awesome!,33764,2
33764,Til they stopped working the third day I had them.,33764,2
33764,Sadness.,33764,2
33765,so tiny!,33765,2
33766,Fun for a day.,33766,2
33766,Cheap material.,33766,2
33766,Feels like plastic,33766,2
33767,Soft but it tore a seam in the back- outside layer the first time I wore it.,33767,2
33767,"...it felt pretty loose so, maybe this was a quality issue?",33767,2
33768,Way too small (but good buying experience.,33768,2
33769,Loved the look but HATED the care instructions.,33769,2
33769,"""Dry clean or hand wash cold""... Um who has time for that for workout clothes??",33769,2
33769,Nope.,33769,2
33769,Returning.,33769,2
33770,Awkward fit.,33770,2
33770,String broke after the first few tugs.,33770,2
33770,Just uncomfortable to wear overall.,33770,2
33770,I normally wear S or XS and ordered a S for this outfit but it was just badly framed.,33770,2
33770,I stay in shape so this is definitely a manufacturing flaw.,33770,2
33771,Looks just like picture.,33771,2
33771,However ypu can't bend it to fit unless you want to really pry it with plyers.,33771,2
33771,So good luck getting it to stay on.,33771,2
33772,"This dress needs some restructuring done to it .The chest area was to tight , while the body was a maternity could not wear it and I ordered my right size 18 w",33772,2
33773,It is poorly made and lays in an awkward way.,33773,2
33773,There is a lot of fabric left over in front that needs to be gathered together to make it fit right.,33773,2
33773,I am disappointed.,33773,2
33774,Very fun t shirt but it's a tight fit.,33774,2
33774,"I'm a slender 5' 9"" guy who weighs 142 lbs.",33774,2
33774,"Typically a size med shirt, which is what I ordered is plenty roomy on me but this shirt is tight through the shoulders and chest.",33774,2
33774,It visibly is wrinkled in the underarm area when I have it on because it's pulled so tight.,33774,2
33774,Disappointed in the fit.,33774,2
33774,"It's a very thin material but I myself like that, others  may not.",33774,2
33774,Graphics are a bit blurry and unfortunately slightly off center it on the chest.,33774,2
33774,Think I just am going to use it as an around the house shirt.,33774,2
33774,It also took a loonnnnggg time to be delivered.,33774,2
33774,Probably won't be ordering from these guys again based on this experience.,33774,2
33775,"Meh, at first I was really happy with these, but the material is super thin and super cheap mine have already started tearing at the seams.",33775,2
33775,And the waist wore out and now require a belt to keep up.,33775,2
33776,The fabric is soft but too sheer.,33776,2
33776,The length was too short to be work appropriate.,33776,2
33776,I'm only 4 foot 10 inches and it was too short for me.,33776,2
33776,I got a small and it was too big.,33776,2
33776,The belt is completely useless unless I were at least 2 sizes bigger around the waste.,33776,2
33776,"I'm a size 4, 110 lbs.",33776,2
33776,the belt was way too big.,33776,2
33777,it was a gift.,33777,2
33777,they really liked them,33777,2
33778,"Was very disappointed, the size was handwritten so not sure how accrue the size was and it did not fit me.",33778,2
33778,Also the bead work on the top half of the dress was very pretty however you are going to have some raw arm.,33778,2
33778,So I returned the dress back.,33778,2
33779,The waist is HUGE and has zero elastic to help with this problem.,33779,2
33779,The material is thin and doesn't hold up well in a wash.,33779,2
33779,Skip this unless you need something very cheap and just for looks.,33779,2
33779,"I attached a picture to show it next to another pair of sweats, both are supposed to be around 31"" but these shorts are massive next to the other sweats.",33779,2
33780,"Don't buy, its completely see through and doesn't have pockets like it looks.",33780,2
33781,"is too smaal
is transparent,",33781,2
33782,Wasn't too crazy about it.,33782,2
33782,Kind of bulky...material harsh.,33782,2
33782,Its ok I guess.,33782,2
33782,Im giving it away though.,33782,2
33783,If you are busty I suggest getting a different swimsuit because the bikini top is too small.,33783,2
33783,the band is fine just no room for my girls and zero support which is heartbreaking since it is as cute as it looks in person.,33783,2
33783,the bottoms fit just fine.,33783,2
33784,I like it Bt the bottom too long if your short,33784,2
33785,It makes noise as it winds.,33785,2
33786,"Very, very small.",33786,2
33786,Nowhere close to the states size!,33786,2
33787,Received a lot of the same colors and same patterns - I would Not buy again.,33787,2
33787,Also most of the foils are very thick and they do Not tranfer very well.,33787,2
33788,Too big,33788,2
33789,Tongue ring faded within 2 days,33789,2
33790,Fits and everything.,33790,2
33790,.but the material is itchy,33790,2
33791,Changed colors,33791,2
33792,sizing doesn't match plus sizes.,33792,2
33792,But still a good price for the product,33792,2
33793,Kinda small and rides up under your arm pits.,33793,2
33793,Would get a long sleeve next time and a size up,33793,2
33794,"I ordered a medium and it fit great, but in the center there was a huge hole.",33794,2
33794,A big part of the crocheted center was missing.,33794,2
33795,Fabric is on a thinner side and shorter than I was expecting.,33795,2
33796,why does the shirt have yourself and urself on it?,33796,2
33796,?,33796,2
33797,The size of the waist band is disproportionately large compared to the leg openings.,33797,2
33798,"I am 5""9"" tall and this skirt was way too long - it has about 6 inches of fabric on the floor.",33798,2
33798,"You would have to be like 6'5"" for this skirt to fit right.",33798,2
33799,The sizing for the top was not good for me at all.,33799,2
33799,The cups in the top were way tiny and offered no support or shape.,33799,2
33799,The black band was too long so it sagged.,33799,2
33799,I didn't even try the bottoms because there was absolutely no way the top would work.,33799,2
33799,I am an A cup and the top was just...odd.,33799,2
33799,For the straps to fit I would have had to order an extra small but for the cups to fit I would have had to order AT LEAST a medium.,33799,2
33799,The style looks cute but there is no way I could get even close to the fit shown in the photo,33799,2
33800,Too too small but its a beautiful dress,33800,2
33801,"Did not fit as expected, but, it cost TOO much in postage to send it back and get my correct size.",33801,2
33802,Sizes are not to to size according to chart....way too small,33802,2
33803,"This look is super cute, but the straps were painful and there's about a foot of fabric that isn't necessary.",33803,2
33804,See through top.,33804,2
33804,No structure so would skip off in a second.,33804,2
33804,Cute though.,33804,2
33805,"I didn't expect the highest quality for this price, the material was cheap which was fine, the length was very short, but the biggest issue is the cut on top.",33805,2
33805,"The dress is cut so that it looks awkward with boobs, the material does not conform at all to the body and the material and cut leads to awkward puckering and shape on the bust.",33805,2
33805,"I ended up buying a new dress after this one arrived, I plan to use this one as a slip.",33805,2
33806,The sun flap doesn't cover your ears (which are very susceptible to sunburns) so for me it's kinda useless.,33806,2
33806,The rest of the hat has nice features but I feel you'll end up looking like a dork with sunburned ears.,33806,2
33807,It came too small.,33807,2
33807,Also the wig cap instantly broke.,33807,2
33807,Very disappointent,33807,2
33808,It didn't look like the picture at all,33808,2
33809,This dress must've been made for a child.,33809,2
33809,"It was VERY petite, and the material of the bottom of the skirt looked nothing like the quality noted on the image posted for it.",33809,2
33809,I'm a bit saddened by this.,33809,2
33809,UNLESS YOU ARE A 8-12 YEAR OLD CHILD...THIS DRESS IN AN EXTRA LARGE WILL LOOK LIKE IT WAS FOR A CHILD and NOT AN ADULT.,33809,2
33810,"As soon as we opened the bag that it came in from, a charm fell off.",33810,2
33810,I knew from that moment that it was not going to be a great product.,33810,2
33810,"The charms are nice if you plan on taking them off and put them onto another chain, but other than that, not worth the buy.",33810,2
33811,Not for well endowed women.,33811,2
33811,I am a 32DDD and the bust was too small and appeared see through.,33811,2
33811,This dress would best work on someone with a more petite frame.,33811,2
33812,very cheap quality.,33812,2
33812,zipper is sticky.,33812,2
33812,it does not look structured like the picture.,33812,2
33813,I am upset that the Thumb hole in the (R) right glove has extra material that makes it difficult to get my thumb inserted into the glove.,33813,2
33813,"The (L) left hand pinky does not have enough room due to a similar issue, the material seems to stop short.",33813,2
33813,The right hand pinky is fine and the left hand thumb is fine which tells me that the size is accurate and it must be the product.,33813,2
33813,"Otherwise, I've used them twice and they appear to be extremely warm, just uncomfortable.",33813,2
33813,Please replace.,33813,2
33814,This band would have been great if it would not have come with some of the paint/finish scratched off because the finish that was intact lol matched peeeeeeeeerfectly with my Samsung Gear S2 Classic.,33814,2
33814,I could have even lived with this by just removing the links that were damaged because I have a small wrist but unlike other bands that I have you are only able to remove 3 certain links on each side and not any ones of your choosing and unfortunately the ones that were damaged were not removable,33814,2
33815,"too small in the breast area and its too short, above the knees.",33815,2
33815,Im 5'6 140lbs 34C,33815,2
33816,"stitching started falling out within 2 months....contacted seller ...
but he would not refund because I had worn it...this belt it junk",33816,2
33817,"Nice looking, but lacks quality.",33817,2
33818,"Beautiful dress....ordered sizes up, but still the arms are way to small and my waist was way to big!!!",33818,2
33818,I felt really sad...not able to wear my dress to  my grade 6 graduation.,33818,2
33819,This was a bit disappointing.,33819,2
33819,Whoever assembled them cross threaded the balls & only one side will come off.,33819,2
33819,"Due to cross threading, the gems do not face the same direction.",33819,2
33819,Definitely won't buy these again.,33819,2
33820,Couldn't zip in up,33820,2
33821,Art work is great but the patch is very thin.,33821,2
33821,I think the patch will fade easily.,33821,2
33822,It took over a month to receive it.,33822,2
33822,I usually wear a LG shirt.,33822,2
33822,I wear a 36DDD.,33822,2
33822,I ordered up a size to a XL.,33822,2
33822,It fit like a small.,33822,2
33822,The reason I gave it 2 stars is I can wear as a girdle under other tank tops.,33822,2
33823,Broke very easily.,33823,2
33824,I donated it to Goodwil.,33824,2
33824,It was way too small,33824,2
33825,"The style is great, and the color is awesome, but my wife and I didn't really like the material this dress is made of.",33825,2
33825,It was not very comfortable to wear.,33825,2
33826,I did the size chart.,33826,2
33826,Ordered 2 sizes up and it's still too small.,33826,2
33827,I bought three suits and everyone talked about how cute they were.,33827,2
33827,One of the suits looked like it somehow was cut in the back of the suits.,33827,2
33827,We were on vacation when they were given so it could not be returned.,33827,2
33828,"So cute but so
Small!",33828,2
33828,"The plunge is
Too deep and the dress is too short.",33828,2
33829,This suit's material is very thin.,33829,2
33829,I will have to wear underthings with it.,33829,2
33829,"I'm 5'1"" and the large fits me long, bunching up the zipper.",33829,2
33829,Waited too long to return it.,33829,2
33830,"Good quality, however, i received the wrong color (ordered navy blue and received a royal blue).",33830,2
33831,Smaller than expected,33831,2
33832,I would not recommend buying these skirts if you are looking to get what the picture shows.,33832,2
33832,the material is definitely much less and not nearly as full and not as flowy as the pictures shows.,33832,2
33832,"i bought this skirt specifically because the waist band looked wider and nicer than the other skirts i was looking at, but turns out it is a cheap, narrow band that won't fit as expected.",33832,2
33832,"i am not a big woman by any means (5'4"", 125lbs) and i don't care for how this waistbands fits and how it more than hugs at my waist.",33832,2
33832,"if you are wanting what the picture shows, look elsewhere.",33832,2
33832,i gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the material is pretty and i hope to get it adjusted by a seamstress...it has potential.,33832,2
33833,"Treated with flame retardants, this was not obvious from the description.",33833,2
33833,"With our baby spending up to 12 hours each day in pajamas, we're sticking with snug-fitting PJs with no extra chemicals.",33833,2
33833,Had to return.,33833,2
33834,This ring has turned color and does not meet my expected look.,33834,2
33834,How can I get a replacement or refund?,33834,2
33835,This is an OK product.,33835,2
33835,It looks cheap though.,33835,2
33836,"Despite ordering according to my daughter's measurements, it was too large and I had to take it in at several spots.",33836,2
33836,The sequins scratched up her arms and were uncomfortable.,33836,2
33836,She wore it once to HomeComing and many beads and sequins fell off and at 2 sites entire strands of them came apart.,33836,2
33837,can wear with tight t.,33837,2
33838,"For what seems like such a well made product, I was surprised when the back of the locket fell out.",33838,2
33838,It is a seperate piece and not easily screwed back in.,33838,2
33838,I used super glue and crossing my fingers it stays in place.,33838,2
33839,The ring is very pretty but very loose and large.,33839,2
33839,Could not use them.,33839,2
33839,Shame...,33839,2
33840,Very cute but way too small.,33840,2
33840,I would recommend getting one or two sizes up,33840,2
33841,Eh I wish I could chose the size because I'm a 34B but I'd like if I could choose a medium.,33841,2
33841,Its a really cute top I had to sew fabric so it wasn't see through but I like it.,33841,2
33841,Ill just have to learn how to crochet when it's starts to get too small,33841,2
33842,"This dress fit awfully, and the material is cheap.",33842,2
33842,"If I lifted my arms above my head, the dress shot up above my butt and almost to my belly button.",33842,2
33842,"I haven't worn this dress out because of its short length, but if I did and I washed it I imagine it would shrink considerably and become even shorter.",33842,2
33843,The image on the wallet is beautiful.,33843,2
33843,However the fit and finish of the wallet is rough and sloppy.,33843,2
33843,Where the fabric wraps around to the inside it's rather rough.,33843,2
33843,It would be better if they tucked  the  raw edge  of the fabric in or covered it,33843,2
33844,I knew they were replicas but they gave me the wrong color.,33844,2
33844,i ordered wood grain with brown lenses and i got black on black.,33844,2
33844,Also the picture they show is not what you get.,33844,2
33844,They show rubber ends over ear but what you get is all plastic also there logos over the bridge of the nose its not bad.,33844,2
33844,the one good thing is that the replacement lenses i bought from fuse did fit.,33844,2
33845,My belt is missing from the costume,33845,2
33846,"Read all the reviews that said it ran big, but it most certainly did not.",33846,2
33846,I bought an XL as I'm usually a L or XL in tops.,33846,2
33846,"This top fit, but was extremely tight, showing my bra and making my upper body appear larger than it is.",33846,2
33846,I suggest you go one size larger.,33846,2
33846,I reordered in an XXL so we shall see.,33846,2
33847,"The lenses are dingy, hard to see through them.",33847,2
33847,It is the material itself not smudges on the lenses.,33847,2
33847,I can not use while driving but will probably use at the beach.,33847,2
33847,These are cheap looking.,33847,2
33847,I've gotten better looking sunglasses at Kmart and Payless shoes stores.,33847,2
33848,This shirt is very pretty.,33848,2
33848,The sleeves were very tight to get on your arms.,33848,2
33848,You would need to be a size 0 in the arms for it to fit properly.,33848,2
33848,Honestly I was a little disappointed.,33848,2
33849,The sizes run small so be careful,33849,2
33850,I am returning item today as it was not what I was expecting.,33850,2
33850,Be aware that this pendant is MUCH smaller than it appears in photos.,33850,2
33850,"The chain length is fine, however, unless you are purchasing for a small child, I wouldn't recommend as the actual arrow is not even 1/2 inch long.",33850,2
33850,"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my 20 year old, so it just won't work.",33850,2
33850,"However, if you are purchasing for a child, it is a pretty necklace and shipping was fast.",33850,2
33851,Beautiful but extremely small!,33851,2
33852,The chest was too small.,33852,2
33852,I am a 40DD and ordered a 2x,33852,2
33853,Too big.,33853,2
33853,I tightened the band all the way.,33853,2
33853,It comes down over my ears.,33853,2
33853,:-( The gold in the background does not look good.,33853,2
33853,It distracts the pretty flowers.,33853,2
33854,Clings to the body.,33854,2
33854,If you had undergarments on you would see all of it.,33854,2
33854,Back of dress not what I expected.,33854,2
33854,I ordered a large and I'm a size 6/8 in dresses and it was a nice fit but felt cheap.,33854,2
33854,And you can see the zipper.,33854,2
33854,Zipper can get caught easy so zip it up slowly and carefully.,33854,2
33855,Heel strap broke when my grand-daughter tried to put it on the first time.,33855,2
33856,Order at least 2 sizes up,33856,2
33857,Extremely light and flimsy feels almost like little kids starter scissors.,33857,2
33857,I have them just for decoration now since the handle feels like it will break.,33857,2
33858,"Not really what I expected but it's wearable..The material is thinner than the dress that I got from another store with the same style and size is way too small  I normally wear a 14/16 and so I normally order 3x in Asian size but this was too small and above my knee , had to give it away",33858,2
33859,Was disappointed finding it was a cutout iron on.,33859,2
33860,Extremely flat.,33860,2
33860,No shape,33860,2
33861,Too big.,33861,2
33862,The shirt I got had an odd chemical odor when I opened it.,33862,2
33862,"When I washed it, I washed it in cold water gentle cycle and it shrank, a lot!",33862,2
33863,"I am a size 14 and because I have bigger thighs, ordered a 1X.",33863,2
33863,I was so disappointed!,33863,2
33863,"Loved the color, but they were way too long and were very tight in my thighs.",33863,2
33863,"Packaging was great and of course, because of Prime, came quickly.",33863,2
33864,These served their purpose and looked great...,33864,2
33864,But don't expect to wear them more than once.,33864,2
33864,They lasted less than 6 hours before the gold fabric started ripping at the sewn seams down the middle of the front.,33864,2
33864,I wore them for a costume party so that was okay since I didn't plan to wear them again (I don't think) but if you're trying to find something to wear more than once or something fashionable... DO NOT buy these.,33864,2
33864,They are very cheaply constructed.,33864,2
33865,Watch face is too big.,33865,2
33865,Looks out of proportion.,33865,2
33866,WAY WAY too small!,33866,2
33866,This would fit a teenager... maybe,33866,2
33867,They were not as dark as in the picture and looked like obvious tights,33867,2
33868,Smelled like really bad cheap plastic.,33868,2
33869,The patterns were nothing like what I had ordered and my kids won't wear them..,33869,2
33870,"I have bought these pants at a retail store, and they fit well.",33870,2
33870,"However, these were too small.",33870,2
33871,"Disappointing the item that arrived, as they are not as pictured.",33871,2
33871,if you see the picture the cuff-links don't have a black background which do come in the ones i received.,33871,2
33871,"i will be returning them, as detail is lost, as you can see on one of the dragons the wing is not as visible as the other one.",33871,2
33872,"It's so pretty, but it doesn't hold an iPhone 6s as described!",33872,2
33873,"Cute, but keeps slipping down leg.",33873,2
33873,Was not too small.,33873,2
33874,disappointed,33874,2
33875,don't like the material but I wear wit pieces separately,33875,2
33876,"This bathing suit fits so awkward, so I can't use it.",33876,2
33876,Don't waste your money.,33876,2
33877,"Way too small, its pretty, but thin fabric",33877,2
33878,"Looks like it would a very light color almost a yellowish, it is not!",33878,2
33878,"Comes in a medium brown, so if you are buying to match a purse (which is what I was doing) that is the color shown in the pictures do not do so.",33878,2
33878,"Otherwise it's a pretty wallet, seems decently made though not real leather.",33878,2
33879,"I thought it would be a little smaller in size, I usually.",33879,2
33879,"Fit a xx, but this was a tad big on me.",33879,2
33880,"Not as described, we got orange colors instead of the cute red and black mickey.",33880,2
33880,Totally different colors.,33880,2
33880,"Not terry lined, I'm not sure how much it will hold the leaking.",33880,2
33881,I wore this for my brother's wedding as a bridesmaid dress.,33881,2
33881,My boobs hurt so much after it.,33881,2
33881,Do not buy!,33881,2
33882,This hoop is smaller than it looked.,33882,2
33882,"Also I thought there was a latch or something, there isn't so you pretty much just squeeze it together.",33882,2
33882,Anyone with longer hair knows what that means.,33882,2
33882,You hair gets caught in it!!,33882,2
33882,Doesn't seem to be the best quality either.,33882,2
33883,Jewels fall off easy :( but i still love it.,33883,2
33884,"I wore it but it literally said ""FLRST CLASS"" on it....had to use a permanent marker to make the L become an I",33884,2
33885,Item is nice but photos all show two and I was angry to find an envelope bigger an a normal letter and only one inside!!!,33885,2
33885,They do not make the description clear and I bought 10 similar ones for 11 dollars so it seemed reasonable there wouldn't two of these for 8 dollars.,33885,2
33885,Not a very forth coming product description or photos and felt very taken advantage of and lied to.,33885,2
33885,Not a good way to do business.,33885,2
33886,Was super small and very cheap material but you get what you pay for.,33886,2
33886,I'm 5'11 and it was super short on me.,33886,2
33887,"pretty, but waaay too small",33887,2
33888,"I purchased this for my 5'-2"" 120 lb 16 year old daughter.",33888,2
33888,The costume is way too tight in the chest area.,33888,2
33888,Everywhere else fit perfectly fine.,33888,2
33888,"It is very cute and had it fit in the chest, I would have been very happy with the costume.",33888,2
33888,"My rating of 2 stars is because to return it, you have to pay to ship it back to China.",33888,2
33888,The costume cost me $18.99 and included free shipping.,33888,2
33888,"However, if I pay for shipping, there is little to no reason to return.",33888,2
33888,To purchase this item is truly a gamble because you will have to keep it even if it doesn't fit.,33888,2
33888,If you are less busty and are of a petite or average stature this will probably work for you.,33888,2
33888,My daughter is a 32C bra size and this was way too tight!,33888,2
33889,Its looks very nice.,33889,2
33889,But broke in the couple days.,33889,2
33890,Color is not as pictured.,33890,2
33890,The actual color is a darker green.,33890,2
33891,Too small.,33891,2
33891,Stays on the phone but doesn't fully cover buttons and side.,33891,2
33892,The design looked great but the leather was very cheap and the wristband was to small!,33892,2
33892,"I lost it at school soon after I put it on, I didn't even notice it fell off because it was so loose(I even put it as tight as I could)!",33892,2
33893,Top is too small even an XL.,33893,2
33893,If Asian clothing makers are going to do us sizes they have to account for large breasts.,33893,2
33894,Not sure if I really like the fit of this dress.,33894,2
33894,"If you have large breasts like I do, it is not a very good choice.",33894,2
33895,"Shirt is great in color and quality but, I ordered a small, which is my size.",33895,2
33895,"I'm 5 feet, 115 pounds and the shirt comes down to almost my knees.",33895,2
33895,I look like I'm playing dress up.,33895,2
33895,Please have sizes for smaller people!,33895,2
33896,Not a fan of the material or the strap adjustors,33896,2
33897,Boxy as ever,33897,2
33898,Was a little snug for the size.,33898,2
33899,"Very cute but they were Too small, reordered next size.",33899,2
33900,I bought these for my 5 month old baby and they didn't fit.,33900,2
33900,"They're only adjustable on one side so if they're  the shortest they'll go, you can't shorten the other side too.",33900,2
33900,Bummer.,33900,2
33900,Size 0-2 is false.,33900,2
33901,Wide opening which isn't great for skinny kids.,33901,2
33901,They fall off easily.,33901,2
33901,Should be marked wide.,33901,2
33902,"I've been trying to find the perfect pair of jean shorts for a while, and unfortunately these are not it.",33902,2
33902,I ordered US Medium/China Large size and they were far too small.,33902,2
33902,I am 130 lbs and typically fit into a 4-6.,33902,2
33902,I will be returning without attempting to exchange.,33902,2
33903,Very thin.,33903,2
33903,You can see the tags through the fabric.,33903,2
33903,The seam ripped before I even wore it.,33903,2
33903,Do not recommend.,33903,2
33904,Already breaking under the arm.,33904,2
33905,Color looks very faded almost like gray .,33905,2
33905,I needed navy color for my son's school.,33905,2
33905,Size is good as well as the material.,33905,2
33906,These are NOT real LOKAI bracelets!,33906,2
33906,They are super cheap knock offs and do not look authentic at all.,33906,2
33906,You get what you pay for!,33906,2
33907,"These are really, really, tiny and not very durable.",33907,2
33907,One broke as soon as I took it out of the package.,33907,2
33907,Guess these won't last long.,33907,2
33907,Not worth the cost!,33907,2
33908,It doesn't curve as in the picture,33908,2
33909,very nice for the price,33909,2
33910,It was too small and really short so I gave it to my boyfriend's little sister who is about 7 years younger than me.,33910,2
33911,was advertised as maternity but no way would it fit around a belly,33911,2
33912,It doesn't look as it is n the picture,33912,2
33913,Zipper tore from I got dress and tried to zip it down.,33913,2
33914,"I verified my measurements against what was listed, but it was much too small, and ill fitting around the ribs, neckline, and arm holes.",33914,2
33914,Best part about it was the belt quality and style.,33914,2
33914,"I returned it, and ordered Grace Karin's black dress in this style instead.",33914,2
33914,Much happier with that.,33914,2
33915,The bottom is great .. Top is to small.,33915,2
33915,Very cheap,33915,2
33916,Returned as it was too small in the chest area but that fabric was perfect wor work and it was suitably dressy with leggings.,33916,2
33917,Attire manufacturer needs to do better job with wrinkles,33917,2
33918,Nice but the large size was a bit too big and i usually wear a large,33918,2
33919,"Material very thin, had a small hole in the back.",33919,2
33919,Not really what I expected.,33919,2
33919,Never wore it,33919,2
33920,There is a seam on the top of the arms which has to be adjusted often and the medium I bought ran small.,33920,2
33920,I got the impression that someone had a pattern and recreated it.,33920,2
33920,Looks better in the pics here than it does on.,33920,2
33920,Buttons are smaller and a bit further off center.,33920,2
33920,Shoulders sit oddly.,33920,2
33921,Material does not have a nice feel -- it's on the rough side.,33921,2
33921,Also it has to be hand washed.,33921,2
33921,I bought the XXL although I normally would take an XL because I thought if runs small.,33921,2
33921,It doesn't.,33921,2
33921,The sizes are accurate.,33921,2
33921,"The shoulders are rounded making the blouse look less than good; in my opinion it looks a little sloppy, certainly not like a dress blouse.",33921,2
33922,I was very disappointed with the boots section of this onesie.,33922,2
33922,They aren't completely red or in a boot shape.,33922,2
33922,They actually look like the foot section of a spider-man onesie with black web lining.,33922,2
33922,The onesie keeps me insanely warm but is somewhat large.,33922,2
33923,"I'm 5'1"" and use Xl,  this dress is beautiful but runs very small.",33923,2
33924,No where close to fit but very nice dress,33924,2
33925,"designed for women with small or no breast, I'll be giving it as a gift to a younger girl that is very tall",33925,2
33926,Top is way to large for a small person.,33926,2
33926,Material at the bottom is so thin that it is sheet and they lined it with a bright white skirt.,33926,2
33926,It doesn't look well at all,33926,2
33927,Let's get the negatives out of the way first.,33927,2
33927,The image for this absolutely lends to higher expectations.,33927,2
33927,"While the price point was not high, I at least expected quality that you would receive from a big box store with comparable costs.",33927,2
33927,The skirt was sewn crooked and the bottom looks to be cut crooked as well.,33927,2
33927,"I can resolve this by cutting it, but as short as it is already is, I doubt I will bother.",33927,2
33927,"The model in the image is probably around 5'3, so keep that in mind as you shop and assess the length for yourself.",33927,2
33927,Upon receiving the package and taking it out I realized that one of the straps was already torn.,33927,2
33927,"It can be sewn so that it will stay attached, but after buying new - I would expect better.",33927,2
33927,Positives.,33927,2
33927,The colors are bright and vibrant.,33927,2
33927,The top has underwire which is great.,33927,2
33927,Shipping was seamless and hassle free.,33927,2
33928,Not cute.,33928,2
33928,Low quality and very cheap did not even use them they look bad,33928,2
33929,This is not a leopard printt.,33929,2
33929,The bottom is all sequins.,33929,2
33929,"Okay, but larger than I thought.",33929,2
33929,"I will keep it for a while, then, I will decide what I am going to do.",33929,2
33930,Weird shape.,33930,2
33930,And way too long shipping time,33930,2
33931,Cut is weird.,33931,2
33931,It fit my bottom half but definitely not the top.,33931,2
33931,I can't go a size up because then I would likely have a saggy back end.,33931,2
33932,size smaller and wears out in crouch in a few months,33932,2
33933,Cute design but broke less than 2 months of wear.,33933,2
33934,It is made OK but the message on the card was not what I expected.,33934,2
33934,The message should be included in the description.,33934,2
33935,The coat was so small my husband could barely get his arms through the sleeves.,33935,2
33935,"I ordered an extra large, however I don't believe it was cut for an Extra Large.",33935,2
33935,I returned the coat .,33935,2
33935,Still waiting for a credit on my payment card.,33935,2
33936,Ball doesn't stay in place for me to tighten the ring,33936,2
33937,It's cute but it looks like the price you pay.,33937,2
33937,I received it and it does have a oder to it and I couldn't stand it and idk the card holder areas looked like it was just cut open...not like the nice stitched one so I returned it.,33937,2
33937,It's great that it blocks out the RFID stuff but I personally didn't care for it.,33937,2
33937,It wasn't for me honestly because I'm picky about that stuff stated but it's not too bad for 9 bucks.,33937,2
33938,Charger still work but the base broke the ball the allows the charger portion to rotate sheared off making it impossible to use it properly.,33938,2
33938,Top can be replaced if you can find an other.,33938,2
33938,Good luck.,33938,2
33938,I modified it to work with a magnetic base I have so it works but I'm not the norm.,33938,2
33938,Overall functionality is fine but quality of product is poor.,33938,2
33939,Not what I expected.,33939,2
33939,The logo on them wears off easily.,33939,2
33939,They are smaller than what I thought.,33939,2
33939,The picture of the logos and the colors aren't accurate to what you'll actually get.,33939,2
33939,Not at all worth the price.,33939,2
33939,Disappointing.,33939,2
33940,This is just a sleeveless tee shirt.,33940,2
33940,If you are looking for support this is not it.,33940,2
33940,Not tight at all.,33940,2
33941,I have a handful of these snap on covers and this is the cheapest made one I have.,33941,2
33941,"Its like spray painted it seems, the color comes off at nearly nothing touching it.",33941,2
33941,It is also much flimsier that other covers I've purchased,33941,2
33942,"It runs small, and I don't think it is wool.",33942,2
33942,The material is very thick and stiff and wrinkles easily.,33942,2
33942,The tags are written in Chinese so I don't know the contents of the material.,33942,2
33942,I am returning it.,33942,2
33943,It was HUGE!,33943,2
33943,"It says it runs small, but it's SO big that I just sleep in It.",33943,2
33944,Size was somewhat small for a large.,33944,2
33944,Material was very thin/see through.,33944,2
33945,Material  look cheap & to small,33945,2
33946,"The hat fit a little large which was fine, however, when trying to tie the leather straps for under the chin, one broke.",33946,2
33947,SO SMALL!!!,33947,2
33947,ORDER 2 TIMES BIGGER THAN YOU NEED.,33947,2
33947,This is a crochet suit with absolutely no give whatsoever.,33947,2
33947,It's not stretchy like most suits and will therefore need to be huge to get on.,33947,2
33947,"If you are a size 0 this would look cute, other wise it's so tight that your butt is crushed and you will spend 10 minutes just trying to get it on ( I didn't even try after my knees) .",33947,2
33947,Mine was also missing several accent buttons.,33947,2
33948,Quality is not that great.,33948,2
33948,Satin lining is baggy in some areas around neckline and shows.,33948,2
33948,Zipper is not sewn in correctly so it gets caught on lace and bunches up.,33948,2
33948,The glue used to attach flower to lace also attached to satin...but not where it should...causes bunching.,33948,2
33949,The dress didn't fit well.,33949,2
33949,"I bought a size up, as recommended, but I had to have it altered.",33949,2
33949,The people were VERY  pleasant to speak to.,33949,2
33949,They answered quickly and politely.,33949,2
33949,It came In On time even though According to my account it wasn't in until days after.,33949,2
33949,I got lots of compliments on the dress.,33949,2
33949,It was comfortable and seemed good quality.,33949,2
33949,The jacket was not good at all!,33949,2
33949,I wore a pashmina instead.,33949,2
33949,The jacket was huge and looked like an old fashioned robe!,33949,2
33949,Again the company was very nice and accommodating.,33949,2
33950,They are way too short and don't fit my legs SOS.,33950,2
33950,Just an average sized human bean ugh.,33950,2
33951,Very thin fabric and it is smaller than I hoped for.,33951,2
33951,I'll have to keep looking.,33951,2
33952,The soul of the shoe was pretty sturdy but the flower fell off within one day.,33952,2
33952,They are definitely a little smaller than expected I would go up about a half size other than the flower fallong off I think they're really cute,33952,2
33953,In the reviews I read this skirt ran big but it was just the opposite.,33953,2
33953,I bought a corduroy skirt from Woolrich 2 years ago and I bought a 12 and it was big so I bought this one in a 10 and it was smaller.,33953,2
33953,I sent it back.,33953,2
33954,Broke apart,33954,2
33955,I was so surprised to find this cute saying on a t-shirt !,33955,2
33955,I'm not sure about the fit yet as it is a gift.the ordering was easy and receiving perfect.,33955,2
33955,"I do have a problem though with the words being so faint, not at all bright like in photo.",33955,2
33956,"Too small for me,way too big for my wife",33956,2
33957,The color is more rose gold...disappointed that was not part  of the description.,33957,2
33957,Pretty dress is you are looking for a Rose Gold dress,33957,2
33958,Does NOT look like photo!,33958,2
33958,I'm 5' 140 lbs.,33958,2
33958,I ordered a medium and the front looks great and thats it.,33958,2
33958,Lace DOES NOT wrap around like that and the lace is scatchy against skin.,33958,2
33958,"In order for the back to be flowly like the picture shows you would probably either need to put a few stiches in it or order a larger size, which then in turn would make the front way to large.",33958,2
33958,"Also in the picture the lace looks off white, In person it is white.",33958,2
33958,I thought about returning for a smaller size so it would fit more like a regular tank top but I thought the bust area would then be to tight.,33958,2
33958,The picture is super cute.....it unfortunetly ends there for me.,33958,2
33959,It was too long for me.,33959,2
33960,It has really rough ends the cut you as you put it on,33960,2
33961,The color I ordered was nothing like the color I received.,33961,2
33961,"Also, order a size bigger than you normally would order.",33961,2
33962,The belt and design was beautiful.,33962,2
33962,I bought one for my son and one for my husband.,33962,2
33962,They both had a problem with the belt not staying locked in place.,33962,2
33962,It would slip out of the groove they had it set in and had to constantly keep adjusting it.,33962,2
33962,I ended up returning them both.,33962,2
33963,It does not fit like the picture.,33963,2
33963,It is not cute and flowy.,33963,2
33963,It fits like a black racer back athletic top for the gym.,33963,2
33963,Its not a sizing issue but a cut issue.,33963,2
33963,The shirt isn't cut in a triangular way so that the bottom is wider and more flowy than the top.,33963,2
33963,Just disappointing.,33963,2
33963,"But if you are looking for confusingly religious themed athletic wear, definitely purchase.",33963,2
33963,Lol,33963,2
33964,Adorable top but was damaged.,33964,2
33964,Returned due to a pick on the front.,33964,2
33964,Very soft.,33964,2
33965,Poor quality.,33965,2
33965,Too small.,33965,2
33966,too sheer,33966,2
33967,Doesn't really lift your butt.,33967,2
33967,It just feels like a strange thong.,33967,2
33967,Better if you already have a butt probably.,33967,2
33968,I would give more stars if the color was accurate.,33968,2
33968,"I ordered the aquamarine, and it was blue.",33968,2
33968,"I was ordering this specifically for the color, so I am disappointed.",33968,2
33969,"Loved it when I first got it, but after wearing it for one day, it began to turn green.",33969,2
33969,Sad to say what you pay for is really what you get.,33969,2
33970,It's cute but it's more of a crop top kind of shirt.,33970,2
33970,I didn't expect it to be that way.,33970,2
33970,I bought 2 sizes up so it could look oversized like the description says but when I put it on it went to my belly button.,33970,2
33970,The top was a bit wide too.,33970,2
33971,Not oversized as stated,33971,2
33972,Center stone is loose.,33972,2
33973,The bag is beautiful but the chain straps were not to my liking so.,33973,2
33973,"I  Purchased the similar bag from you with the fabric in the chain strap, Fabulous!",33973,2
33974,"Item wasn't clear on which size i was getting i needed thev16g but i got the 14g, even though it tells you on OR the other.",33974,2
33975,This blouse runs very small.,33975,2
33975,I ordered a large.,33975,2
33975,The large is more close to a small than any other size.,33975,2
33975,The design is very pretty though.,33975,2
33976,"Looks real, but really cheap fabric.",33976,2
33976,"Don't buy, waste of money, I never wear.",33976,2
33977,The fabric is excellent but the cut is small in the groin and had more of a woman's panty appearance,33977,2
33978,"Very weird material... (very stretchy, but non-conforming, if that paints a picture).",33978,2
33978,This is why I ended up not keeping it.,33978,2
33978,"But the material was thick, so it might be nice for layering during Autumn.",33978,2
33978,It was also longer than I expected.,33978,2
33978,"I'm 5'5"" and it scraped the ground for me as I stood barefoot.",33978,2
33978,"Buttons well sewn on and straightforward, nice structure.",33978,2
33979,Returned item.,33979,2
33979,It was too small,33979,2
33980,I ordered these because my newborn granddaughter was scratching herself with her long nails.,33980,2
33980,"Other mittens were not staying on her hands so I went for the expensive ones that were called ""Stay On"" mittens!",33980,2
33980,"Well, they didn't stay on any better than all the other ones we've tried.",33980,2
33981,Really nice but way to big!!,33981,2
33981,Had to return,33981,2
33982,Do not waste your money on this one.,33982,2
33982,Get the bamboo one instead.,33982,2
33982,"I am 127 lbs after I delivered 4 weeks ago with a 28"" waste.",33982,2
33982,I got the xsmall and it fits fine.,33982,2
33982,However it folds so easy and crinkles.,33982,2
33982,Feels so cheaply made.,33982,2
33982,I got the bamboo one and it is so soft and smooth and MUCH more comfortable to wear.,33982,2
33982,Save yourself the money and go straight for bamboo style.,33982,2
33983,So disappointed with this coat.,33983,2
33983,"Although it looks nice, the size is much much smaller than the size chart indicates.",33983,2
33983,I normally wear a large to extra large.,33983,2
33983,I ordered a xxl hoping to be able to wear a sweater underneath of it.,33983,2
33983,"Couldn't even get the coat closed, let along zipped up.",33983,2
33983,Sleeves were very tight.,33983,2
33983,Zipper poorly made.,33983,2
33984,Top was way short won't wear it,33984,2
33985,"The large should have fit per the measurements, but it was way too small.",33985,2
33985,"I liked the skirt so I sent it back and ordered an XL, and when it arrived it was actually smaller than the large!",33985,2
33986,The material itself is better than I expected.,33986,2
33986,I do like the design and the size is perfect.,33986,2
33986,"However, the zippers are HORRIBLE.",33986,2
33986,I've only opened the bag twice and already there's a thread loose on the zipper and it opened up while closed.,33986,2
33986,I have a feeling it's only going to get worse with time.,33986,2
33986,I'd rather pay a little more for a better zipper.,33986,2
33987,"Will make good shower shoes not as cushioney as they look, no cushion at all",33987,2
33988,It was ok,33988,2
33989,I'm a pants size 12/14 and bought the 3XL size.,33989,2
33989,Can't even get them on.,33989,2
33989,Way too small.,33989,2
33990,I would not suggest buying this product mainly because it has no support,33990,2
33991,"ordered petite,but received regular length.",33991,2
33991,"Would have returned them, but needed them for  gift for Mother's Day.",33991,2
33991,Had to spend an additional $10.00 to have them tailored.,33991,2
33992,Clasp was broken out of the box.,33992,2
33992,Not worth returning,33992,2
33993,Doesnt work very well.,33993,2
33993,The wrap they give you in the hospital works much better.,33993,2
33993,You actually feel like your being held in and when you lose weight you can adjust it this one you cant.,33993,2
33994,They are such poor quality that they fell apart within a day.,33994,2
33994,The plastic in the frame and temples is so thin that I'm surprised the hinge gave first.,33994,2
33995,Cute overalls but I purchased size 12-18months and the overalls received could fit a 3 year old.,33995,2
33995,They are waaaaay too big!,33995,2
33995,On top of that they don't smell too pleasant.,33995,2
33995,I'm hoping to wash them so they may shrink and smell better.,33995,2
33996,Way smaller than described.,33996,2
33997,Too small didn't fit as expected I shall returning it,33997,2
33998,"Read size chart carefully, I got a large and it fits my kid.",33998,2
33998,My kid loves the shirt but husband is bummed.,33998,2
33999,Sizes run small.,33999,2
33999,My daughter normally wears a medium had to buy XL for her.,33999,2
33999,"Material is not of the best quality, but for the price you can't expect much.",33999,2
33999,With a little Accessories and some nice shoes she made it work.,33999,2
34000,"Label says XXL, but it is just  L. If went to Goodwill.",34000,2
34001,Honestly  I think I wore this 2 times.,34001,2
34001,I was about 5 months pregnant and just started showing with a small bump.,34001,2
34001,"I wanted to wear my pants a little longer, but this didn't work.",34001,2
34001,It was too big and just not for me,34001,2
34002,"Cheap, flimsy.",34002,2
34002,Beginning to change color.,34002,2
34003,I was so excited for this shirt.,34003,2
34003,But it came to just under my breasts.,34003,2
34003,(I am busty) but I ordered the largest size possible.,34003,2
34003,The fabric was nice and the design was great.,34003,2
34003,Amazon issued a refund immediately after I shipped it back.,34003,2
34004,"******update*******

Now at 36 lbs and 34"" tall it finally fits my son.",34004,2
34004,He got to wear it once.,34004,2
34004,"Because in the second wash, it has started falling apart.",34004,2
34004,Super disappointed.,34004,2
34004,Super cute!,34004,2
34004,"Sized quite large, my baby is 31"" tall and weighs 29 lbs, in spite of being just shy of his 1 year birthday.",34004,2
34004,He consistently fits size 24 mos clothes from several major clothes companies.,34004,2
34004,But this romper won't fit him for another year. ',34004,2
34004,Considering ordering another one in a 18 mos size so he can wear it now.,34004,2
34004,"It's a perfect lightweight pajama, or a summer evening cover-up.",34004,2
34004,It won't keep a baby warm in anything lower than 65 degrees because it's fairly lightweight.,34004,2
34004,"But it's nicely made, it's soft and the design is actually a dye relief and NOT a sticky tacky sticker overplayed in the fabric which ruins the feel of clothes, especially for babies.",34004,2
34005,This shirt is cheap.,34005,2
34005,The fabric is stiff and the stripes are painted on.,34005,2
34005,It did not have buttons on the shoulder like described  and the neck is small.,34005,2
34005,It is also longer than typically worn in the U.S.,34005,2
34005,"I also bought the same shirt different applique, same size and the one shirt is much larger.",34005,2
34005,It also had extra fabric hanging from the shoulder seam.,34005,2
34005,Only reason i am giving it two stars is because my son loves it.,34005,2
34006,Order them in black and white stripe and I received them in red and white.,34006,2
34007,"I wanted the exact legging pictured, and what I got was a completely different pattern, diagonal stripes and stars on both legs.",34007,2
34007,I already have the exact pair that was sent to me.,34007,2
34007,"The fit and material were what i thought they would be, but so DISSAPOINTED that i don't get the split leg pattern that is pictured!",34007,2
34008,"I had great hopes for this dress, which looks lovely in the picture.",34008,2
34008,"The fabric is nice, but the pattern is garish.",34008,2
34008,The main problem is the fit.,34008,2
34008,"Rather than slimming, the way it fits at the waist actually accentuates the tummy area, and so looks like a maternity dress.",34008,2
34008,On its way back to Amazon in a return bag.,34008,2
34009,"Too small, can't wear and the length makes me look short than I already am.",34009,2
34009,5'3.,34009,2
34010,poorly made.,34010,2
34010,total made in china crap!,34010,2
34011,Poor quality.,34011,2
34011,Fits though.,34011,2
34012,It was the correct size but the light switch is broken and stays on all day and  drain the battery,34012,2
34013,I have a narrow face and these were way too wide.,34013,2
34014,Not flattering,34014,2
34015,"Not comfortable at all
Not happy
It's not smooth under clothes makes me lol bulkier",34015,2
34016,Runs small and the cuffs are so itchy.,34016,2
34016,The cuffs also fit funny where they are sewn to the sleeve they are not a flush straight sleeve like you would think,34016,2
34017,I bought the next sizes than my usually size and it still is a bit small.,34017,2
34017,Material is also on light side and cheap.,34017,2
34018,"The suit itself is cute, of course it varies from the picture a bit.",34018,2
34018,The small strap in the back is the real problem...,34018,2
34018,There is absolutely no stretch in it to be pulled up any higher than your mid thigh.,34018,2
34018,"According to all the measurements listed it should have been spot on, I ordered the correct size for me.",34018,2
34018,"Very disappointed in the purchase, it was returned immediately.",34018,2
34019,Fabric was very thin.,34019,2
34019,"Pretty color, but not a heavy enough fabric.",34019,2
34020,Really not good quality...,34020,2
34020,I don't recommend this at all.,34020,2
34021,Too small.,34021,2
34022,"These are cute as shorts but are not appropriate as a ""swimming suit bottom""  as they do not have a lined panty area.",34022,2
34023,"The ends of the bones poke very hard and totally uncomfortable, not enough padding on the edges.",34023,2
34024,I love Toms but these guys fell apart within two weeks.,34024,2
34024,"Granted, my little girl is hard on shoes and plays outside a lot, I would recommend that if you purchase these, it be for church or functions, not school or everyday wear.",34024,2
34025,It's cut very narrowly where it should flare outward starting around the shoulders so it drapes.,34025,2
34025,It's probably ok if you're a size 0.,34025,2
34025,"However, the material isn't just thin, it's beyond thin...like x-ray vision thin.",34025,2
34025,It actually showed way more of my undergarments than I thought possible (I think you could read the washing instructions on the tags!).,34025,2
34025,"Also, some of the seams were just seamed and not finished (edge serged, etc.",34025,2
34025,"), so lots of fraying and strings from that.",34025,2
34025,I wish they'd make it decently out of good material and just charge more for a good product.,34025,2
34025,"The colors are so pretty, it's why I bought it.",34025,2
34026,I order using size chart.,34026,2
34026,"Ordered a medium, never wore this because it was to small in the bust.",34026,2
34026,If you order this you need at least 2 sizes bigger if you are over a b cup.,34026,2
34026,The quality is good considering what you pay for it,34026,2
34027,This fit my very awkwardly.,34027,2
34027,Would not recommend for someone with a fuller figure.,34027,2
34027,Giving two stars instead of one because I should have known better...,34027,2
34028,too small!,34028,2
34029,"I want to like this, its so cute but it's  so large and bulky.",34029,2
34030,Faded after first wash.,34030,2
34031,WAY too short and without adjustable straps.,34031,2
34031,"I'm 5'7"" and this could barely work as a top/blouse extender.",34031,2
34031,The cloth ends at my hips and the lace barely comes down long enough to cover my underwear.,34031,2
34031,I'll be on the hunt for an actual dress extender.,34031,2
34032,Size was toooo small as advertised,34032,2
34033,Very disappointed as this is a very cute shirt!!,34033,2
34033,Runs VERY small .........  Color is off.,34033,2
34033,More yellow?,34033,2
34033,Than cream,34033,2
34034,I'm 5'8 and 150 lbs and I usually wear medium tops and large bottoms for swimsuits.,34034,2
34034,The bottoms were a tad too tight and cheeky for my liking (I already have problems with 'full coverage' bottoms being too cheeky on me) and the top was a tad too small on my 34 B chest.,34034,2
34034,"The top wasn't even straight, like it was sewn wrong.",34034,2
34034,"The more petite you are, the better they will fit you!",34034,2
34034,"Besides the sizing I thought the overall quality was good, especially for what you pay for.",34034,2
34035,They run way to small,34035,2
34036,Was much lighter in color that I though it would be.,34036,2
34036,Returning.,34036,2
34037,"I ordered the coral color and read the other reviews about the color saying its a reddish orange color which is ok with me, but when I received it its BRIGHT ORANGE.",34037,2
34038,Not as expected,34038,2
34039,Runs small really did not like the feel of the material and wrinkles way too easy.,34039,2
34040,I ordered size small but way too big!,34040,2
34040,However the material was good.,34040,2
34041,It looked good but the medium was really big for me.,34041,2
34041,"Also, they packed it in a small box and it was wrinkled.",34041,2
34042,"I planned for that but my biggest problem was the pocket size, much too small for my needs it was sent back on Saturday the 23rd via US -postal service it took over 2 days to let me know I could send it back !",34042,2
34042,!,34042,2
34042,!,34042,2
34043,bottoms are HUGE,34043,2
34044,Not the bathing suit for you if you are large busted.,34044,2
34044,The top is definetly ment for flat chested people.,34044,2
34045,No loose change compartment.,34045,2
34046,"I'm 5'6"", 125lbs, 34a, so I ordered a small.",34046,2
34046,This was huuge.,34046,2
34046,"It was basically a lampshade, I was swimming in fabric.",34046,2
34046,"It'd be cute if it fit, so maybe if you're usually a large, order a small and enjoy :D",34046,2
34047,Cute but nowhere near true to size.,34047,2
34047,I ordered a large and it fit like an extra small.,34047,2
34048,Very short  I didn't think it was a cover up.,34048,2
34048,I thought it was a shirt.,34048,2
34049,Not great,34049,2
34050,I purchased this shirt for a Halloween costume because it appeared to be the righteous and color.,34050,2
34050,"The fit was fine, but be warned, as it is not so much green as very, very teal.",34050,2
34050,"Unfortunately, too teal for the costume so it's now useless.",34050,2
34051,too small and more the length of a shirt,34051,2
34052,Need return slip,34052,2
34053,The most I'll fitting bathing suit I've ordered.,34053,2
34053,The top is too small with no support and the bottom is too big.,34053,2
34053,I wouldn't be surprised if I weren't built like a coke bottle but I have plenty of butt to keep these bottoms up.,34053,2
34053,Save your money!,34053,2
34053,Trust me!,34053,2
34054,not what I expected,34054,2
34055,"I am 5'8 and 130ish lbs and I ordered an 8, and it was absolutely horrible.",34055,2
34055,"I'm not even sure how it's supposed to fit, and honestly it's not worth the purchase.",34055,2
34055,"It smells weird and the material is very cheap and the seems are very badly made, like the girl in the picture is probably wearing some really awesome brand and this company just tried to copy it and didn't do very good.",34055,2
34055,"So, if you're very short and skinny I might suggest to try this out but if you're tall and are thick in all the right places I don't reccomend.",34055,2
34056,I could not get these shoes on my 5-year-old and had to return them.,34056,2
34056,He normally wears size 1 in Striderite gym shows but neither size 1 or 2 of these Vans would go on his feet.,34056,2
34056,I gave up and returned both pairs.,34056,2
34057,It does not look like the model...,34057,2
34057,It is a flimsy fabric that is very wrinkled.,34057,2
34057,It looks like it would get caught and strings would get pulled out immediately.,34057,2
34057,It looks like a trash bag :(,34057,2
34058,Too large in the bottoms and too small on the top,34058,2
34059,Nothing glamours about this jacket but it got the job done for Halloween.,34059,2
34059,Not a great value for the price paid.,34059,2
34060,"The size is exactly what is described, however, the color is not at all tan/beige.",34060,2
34060,It is a very powder pink color.,34060,2
34060,I have been unable to use this purse as I have wanted to.,34060,2
34061,"There's a seam running across the top front of the dress, I guess the seamstress assumed it wouldn't be noticable because she/he didn't even try to hide it.",34061,2
34061,The fact that it arrived looking waded up and needing ironed was disappointing enough but bad tailoring is unnecessary and I can't fix that in time for a wedding.,34061,2
34062,"The shirt is cute, but fits small.",34062,2
34062,"Normally, I wear a xl size, but the xxl size would fit someone who wears a large size.",34062,2
34063,Wasn't what I expected it to be.,34063,2
34064,needs to state runs lg...exchanging bc I love the shirt,34064,2
34065,Very cute but only came with one useable strap.,34065,2
34065,My son loves it so I'm hoping to get a replacement one.,34065,2
34066,"Super weird material, kind of like a mesh.",34066,2
34066,I don't like it at all.,34066,2
34066,It also smelled really bad upon arrival.,34066,2
34067,"I bought a pair of these pretty rainbow leggings last year, and loved them!",34067,2
34067,They were bright and cheerful and plush and warm -- perfect for the winter.,34067,2
34067,"This year, I tried buying a larger size for my now almost 5-yr-old, but the size chart made no sense to me (due to the difference in American and Chinese sizings).",34067,2
34067,I made my best guess and ordered a size 130.,34067,2
34067,"To my disappointment, the leggings were too small for my daughter (whose first pair, I subsequently discovered, are labeled size 130 -- but they are actually bigger than the new pair that I just bought)!",34067,2
34067,"In addition, the new pair is thinner and less plush than the first pair.",34067,2
34067,"Needless to say, I'm disappointed.",34067,2
34067,"I still think the rainbow stripes design is adorable, but I wish larger sizes were available.",34067,2
34067,I'm giving this pair to a 3 yr-old niece.,34067,2
34068,Too small.,34068,2
34069,Very pretty but wear it for a week and it turn my finger black,34069,2
34070,It's a good looking shirt and seems well made but 3x is actually an xl at best.,34070,2
34071,Doesn't look like the same material in photos.,34071,2
34072,Top was slightly loose and bottom was very small.,34072,2
34072,I'm 5'2; 118 lb; typically fit a size 4.,34072,2
34072,Bottoms were way too small and not usable.,34072,2
34073,cute but very short and I am 5'2,34073,2
34074,"It fits like an over-sized crop top, not at all what I expected.",34074,2
34075,The layout is nice.,34075,2
34075,The purse itself is not as good of a quality as I thought it was going to be... and it's super big.,34075,2
34075,And teeth on the zipper is missing!!!!,34075,2
34075,WTH!,34075,2
34075,?,34075,2
34076,"My bands didn't fit and once closed, the bands on top fell off",34076,2
34077,Very nice but very small,34077,2
34078,Waaay too small for a medium unisex.,34078,2
34078,Will probably need to send back.,34078,2
34079,"It's a little too short, I have to depend on the extender in order to be able to wear it, which takes away from the beauty of it.",34079,2
34079,I would say it's for very slim wrists.,34079,2
34080,"according to te sizing chart it should have fit....but it is so small, it might fit a child",34080,2
34081,ordered 2 sizes larger than normal.,34081,2
34081,still couldn't wear it.,34081,2
34082,"I am 5'8"", 120 lb and I ordered the smallest size they had (a medium) and it was WAY too big.",34082,2
34082,it was super wide at the waist (over 6 inches of extra fabric) and about 5 inches too long.,34082,2
34082,"Keep in mind that if you are my size, you will need extra time and money to alter it.",34082,2
34082,I had to return it.,34082,2
34082,The color is also more of a Pepto Bismol pink than a blush.,34082,2
34083,This necklace is a lot bigger than I expected.,34083,2
34083,The low rating is for the quality of the item.,34083,2
34083,I know this was very inexpensive and you get what you pay for.,34083,2
34083,The beads were falling off as soon as I opened the package.,34083,2
34084,material is scratchy,34084,2
34085,More like a shirt than a summer dress,34085,2
34086,"I like the look and feel of this product, but since I got it my mouse has barely slid over it.",34086,2
34086,"There is a defect in how the top layer was applied to the bottom layer, and it wasn't flat during that transaction so there is an air pocket in the middle that doesn't allow my mouse to slide over it well.",34086,2
34086,Contacted the seller about this and heard NOTHING back.,34086,2
34086,"Would not buy this product, get one somewhere else.",34086,2
34086,"I honestly should have just kept the one I had before with the same issue, would have saved me money.",34086,2
34087,Looks nothing like the picture,34087,2
34088,Not the best cat ears or tail.,34088,2
34088,I would not buy again and would recommend looking at other products.,34088,2
34089,much smaller than any 2X I've ever purchased.,34089,2
34090,Very flimsy fabric.,34090,2
34090,I sent them back.,34090,2
34091,Material is way to thin.,34091,2
34092,This is not what I expected.,34092,2
34092,I can use them in my shop for welding and grinding metal.,34092,2
34092,They seem too small for an adult.,34092,2
34093,Very strange cut and poor quality!,34093,2
34094,Returning for larger size,34094,2
34095,The sleeves were rather small.,34095,2
34095,I have large arms so I couldn't wear it.,34095,2
34095,I don't feel the picture represents the product well.,34095,2
34095,It might work for a very petite person.,34095,2
34096,"Not bad looking for the price, but way smaller than expected.",34096,2
34097,"Don't bother, very cheap, not well made.",34097,2
34098,"The quality of the wig is great, but not for Len.",34098,2
34098,I could not style the needed spikes for Len nor was the ponytail appropriate.,34098,2
34098,"Sure, it was long enough, but not high enough.",34098,2
34098,"The color is alright, but it lacks hair in certain parts when you undo the ponytail it comes in to fix the ponytail offered.",34098,2
34098,"I tried putting the wig on with the given ponytail, but the size of the wig was restrained to fit any normal head shape.",34098,2
34098,"I'm sorry, but no :/",34098,2
34099,"As a dress, this would get 0 stars.",34099,2
34099,"While I noticed the model wearing jeans, her hemline still looks long enough for this to be worn atleast as a mini dress--this is not the case.",34099,2
34099,"The shortest points are the front & back center so your goodies show without you bending over--for reference, I am only 5'5"".",34099,2
34099,"However, if you are looking for a shirt, this would be ok.",34099,2
34099,The material is a slinky knit so size up if you have any lumps/bumps.,34099,2
34100,My son loves these because they are Marshall but they quality is downright awful!,34100,2
34100,They are so thin and cheaply made that I am very disappointed.,34100,2
34100,He is only 3 so he doesn't know any better but I would NEVER pay $21 for these!,34100,2
34100,!,34100,2
34101,The coat was too small .,34101,2
34101,Waste of money.,34101,2
34102,The legs are way too long and the fit is small and strange.,34102,2
34103,The wallet is described as being 9inches and falls short by 1 1/2 inches.,34103,2
34103,Not as I would expect.,34103,2
34104,"The black symbol looks sharp in this picture but buyer beware, the hat is a cheap, light black print.",34104,2
34104,Normally I would not leave a review & just simply return the item but when  I tried to return the item the seller asked for a picture.,34104,2
34104,"Once I sent him a picture, I never got a response.",34104,2
34104,"Overall, if the symbol was a patch & cost more money, it would be so much nicer.",34104,2
34105,The women's large is more like a medium.,34105,2
34105,I had to return it to get a women's extra large.,34105,2
34105,Buyer beware.....,34105,2
34106,Wish it looked as good in person,34106,2
34107,The design is cute but the barbell caused me some irritation.,34107,2
34107,I had to remove it less than 24 hours after insertion.,34107,2
34107,I'm sensitive to  most metals hence the 2 star review not 1.,34107,2
34108,"This fit as delivered, however shrunk in the washer (warm/cold wash)...I hang my clothes so didn't expect to have any issues...",34108,2
34109,Crazy thick and itchy.,34109,2
34109,There's no way you can make a baby wear this in the hot sun.,34109,2
34109,Got the colibar hooded one instead.,34109,2
34110,I don't like this!,34110,2
34110,It's not even a dress it's like for swimsuit for cover up...,34110,2
34111,"Not comfortable, rigid and pushed in the wrong places.",34111,2
34112,I returned this item as the color is not at all what I ordered.,34112,2

34114,Order 2 sizes up,34114,2
34115,It was OK...,34115,2
34116,Cute but ridiculously small and painful.,34116,2
34116,There's no lining so the sequins just cut into your skin,34116,2
34117,"Buy a size above, they run small.",34117,2
34118,"Quality was not good, thin and too short in the front color looked faded",34118,2

34119,Sent both costs back and didn't reorder.,34119,2
34120,Didn't fit right.,34120,2
34121,Love it however received it with a hole in it I emailed them and have not heard back and I ordered 3 :( so we could have matching ones,34121,2
34122,Hardly the same product as pictured/advertised.,34122,2
34122,"The fit, color, and look are very different than the description.",34122,2
34123,"Bralette was a bit too big, I am a 32B and the small was too large for me.",34123,2
34123,The quality was not too great either,34123,2
34124,"I was excited to receive this feminine night outfit but when it came and I took it out the package my first thought was ""this feels like it could rip easily"" and then when I put it on it was way too big.",34124,2
34124,I ordered a medium and at 150 pounds that isn't a normal occurrence.,34124,2
34124,I returned it in the end,34124,2
34125,I normally wear a 1x but I order a 2x still cute very small,34125,2

34128,Too small and the neck is super wide.,34128,2
34128,Completely poor fit.,34128,2
34129,I never wore this.,34129,2
34129,Just donated it.,34129,2
34129,It didn't fit right and way to short to wear with leggings.,34129,2
34129,Im 5 ft tall and it barely covered my butt.,34129,2
34130,"I bought a Lg, it was waaayyy too small.",34130,2
34130,I do however wear it as a shirt and it looks really nice paired  with a pencil skirt.,34130,2
34130,I may have to buy another in a different color.....yes to wear as a shirt.,34130,2
34131,First off I must admit these shorts fit me perfectly and I'm very pleased with them.,34131,2
34131,I had to ding them 1* due to price.,34131,2
34131,I paid $64.50 for the black/camo colored pair.,34131,2
34131,This color is the only one priced so high.,34131,2
34131,Other colors seem to vary in price from $38 up to $59.,34131,2
34131,"I don't feel like any board shorts are worth $65, but I sucked it up and bought them anyway because it's the color I really wanted.",34131,2
34131,"Other then price, my only negative comment would be that the carabiner with tiny flashlight are completely unnecessary imo.",34131,2
34131,"I mean, these are mostly intended to be swimming shorts...so why on earth do i need a flashlight or compass (last year model came w/carabiner and compass).",34131,2
34131,Maybe ditch the uneccesary hardware and drop the price accordingly.,34131,2
34131,Then I'd give these shorts 6 stars out of 5.,34131,2
34131,**revised down to two stars.,34131,2
34131,After 2nd washing the drawstring came out and is IMPOSSIBLE to re-thread back in.,34131,2
34131,"For the high price paid for these shorts, the drawstring should have been designed as such that it would not come through.",34131,2
34131,Even if that means they come with knots already tied.,34131,2
34131,At this point I'm frustrated with these shorts.,34131,2
34132,strange long legs,34132,2
34133,"The top to this swim suit is nothing but material, it will not wrap around my chest to fully cover them...",34133,2
34134,I wear a 38 C and I couldn't wear it my boobs were hanging out of the side of the shirt so I gave it to my lil sis who is like an AA cup and size 1.,34134,2
34135,Sizes run EXTREMELY small!,34135,2
34135,Order at least 2 sizes bigger than u wear.,34135,2
34136,"I'm 5'10"" and 175lbs.",34136,2
34136,Ordered an 2XL size using their chart.,34136,2
34136,"What I received claimed to be a 2XL but was mislabeled, and wrong item.",34136,2
34136,"It barely fit and whose chest and shoulder measurements were 26"" circumference, So obviously for a child.",34136,2
34136,"Material was similar to a heavy gauge hoodie material

HOWEVER, they people were kind enough to shoot me a label and conduct the return quickly.",34136,2
34137,Wayyyy to small,34137,2
34138,Not flame retardent and not fit for children to wear.,34138,2
34139,Color not clear in picture.,34139,2
34139,Very cheaply made.,34139,2
34139,Hard material near neck which makes it uncomfortable.,34139,2
34139,Looks much better in picture than it really is.,34139,2
34140,"i ordered one of this dres in size small, but two dresses was shipped to me so i had to pay for an extra dress which i see unfair, futhermore the material is very poor..",34140,2
34141,"The lenses on these glasses are perfectly flat and are not comfortable when worn; Quality of the glasses is fine - mirrored sunglasses; my biggest concern when ordering was the sturdiness of the construction, and these glasses feel as though they will not stand up to daily use without breaking.",34141,2
34141,"Given the ""flat"" lens and lack of sturdiness, I've placed these in the glovebox in my car for those opportunities when I need sunglasses when driving and have nothing to wear - after the drive, they will go back into the glovebox until I forget the first and second string glasses that I try to keep with me all of the time.",34141,2
34142,"This one is weird, it is small in the arms",34142,2
34143,Had to send these back.,34143,2
34143,There was a run in the fabric right in the front.,34143,2
34143,The run started from the seam,34143,2
34144,"I didn't expect great quality for the few bucks I spent, but breaking the first day a wore it was a tad disappointing.",34144,2
34144,Its very nice though so I shall try to fix the darn toggle that holds it on my wrist.,34144,2
34145,"The product is cheaply made, and I guess that was to be expected for the price, My daughter wore it once and the chain broke on both pieces, will have to buy a better quality chain.",34145,2
34146,I am not to sure what to say here because I end up buy the wrong size but I was glad that I give it to someone who can make used of it but they some good looking shoes,34146,2
34147,"The glasses feel cheap, not like other ICU products.",34147,2
34147,"In addition, the pouch that the glasses came with was too small for the glasses and not what was pictured.",34147,2
34147,The workmanship was not up to ICU standards.,34147,2
34147,These are obviously fake.,34147,2
34147,find your reading glasses elsewhere.,34147,2
34148,"It didn't come with the necklace which wasn't a big deal but if you say it will come with the dress, then make that happen.",34148,2
34148,Then the dress didn't fit like it looked in the picture but I guess I shouldn't believe it 100%.,34148,2
34148,It drags the floor and is cheap material.,34148,2
34148,The seems are coming apart.,34148,2
34149,Expected to be larger.,34149,2
34150,For the price you can't expect more.,34150,2
34151,I had purchased these for my elderly mother.,34151,2
34151,The outer ridge is to hard and totally inflexible.,34151,2
34151,I found them VERY difficult to put on and I know she wouldn't have the dexterity to handle them..,34151,2
34151,I thought they would have an elastic edge which would allow easier and softer handling.,34151,2
34151,I had to return them.,34151,2
34151,Sorry.,34151,2
34152,runs very small,34152,2
34153,I had my baby four days ago and my milk came in last night.,34153,2
34153,The clasp on the left cup of the nursing bra I wore today busted after I finished feeding my baby.,34153,2
34153,I'm disappointed as today was the second time is worn said bra and I'm not so completely engorged that it would merit broken clasps.,34153,2
34154,Ok so I'm not a women who is thin at all.,34154,2
34154,If you are a plus size women..this is not a good product to buy.,34154,2
34154,I repeat this is not a good product at ALL.1St of all the material is good and stretchy..but the material does not stick..it rolls up in the back and on the sides and it's does not fit the whole torso.,34154,2
34154,A waist trainer is suppose to stay in place not roll up...other than this product has good material to it....THIS WAS A HORRIBLE BUY!!!!,34154,2
34154,!,34154,2
34155,Cute but small,34155,2
34156,Came as pictured but a screw came out before i could even wear them.,34156,2
34156,Cannot return due to where I live but I'm sure it's just ONE bad set,34156,2
34157,Very short doesn't cover your butt.,34157,2
34158,Really thin material.,34158,2
34159,"Good quality and nice looking, but at least two sizes smaller than what is advertised",34159,2
34160,These are not for girls with bigger thighs.,34160,2
34160,Did not fit and I am a 12.,34160,2
34161,They are cute but obviously are cheap.,34161,2
34161,But for some shoes that she won't be in for long they were worth it.,34161,2
34162,"It came above my jeans so useless, but I am tall.",34162,2
34162,So on a shorter girls this could be cute.,34162,2
34163,"The latex smell is really bad, and it's very hard to put on.",34163,2
34164,Upset,34164,2
34165,Its beautiful but too short.,34165,2
34165,Its not as long as it seems in the picture.,34165,2
34165,It only covers me till my belly button lengthe.,34165,2
34165,I wanted something that covered my hips.,34165,2
34166,The color I received did not look at all like what was pictured online.,34166,2
34166,I was buying this as a bridesmaid dress and was disappointed the the product didn't really match the description.,34166,2
34167,Low quality shirt.,34167,2
34167,Wouldn't recommend it.,34167,2
34168,This was way too small.,34168,2
34169,"I didn't pay close enough attention and this is yellow, not silver.",34169,2
34169,I don't wear yellow.,34169,2
34169,"PLUS, one of the red stones was already loose in the bag when it arrived.",34169,2
34169,I didn't even bother to return.,34169,2
34170,Not made with very quality fabric or workmanship.,34170,2
34171,Too narrow for a xxl tie.,34171,2
34171,"Instead go for Big Shot Neckwear brand for a true, proportional size.",34171,2
34172,It was thinner than I expected and I really didn't like the shimmer on the fabric.,34172,2
34173,Not attractive,34173,2
34174,length was shorter than expected thin material,34174,2
34175,Just a little bulky and in the way,34175,2
34176,Was extremely too small for me and I got a large.,34176,2
34176,"I'm 160lbs so if you're around my body size, it won't even fit your arms.",34176,2
34177,They have larger lenses than the Wayfarers I've had in the past.,34177,2
34177,"My biggest problem with them is the blue tint you see when looking through them, all warm colors are extremely muted.",34177,2
34177,You would think the lenses would have a warm tint if anything based on their color.,34177,2
34177,"Spend an extra $5 and get the zeroUV brand instead, I've bought them many times and enjoyed every pair.",34177,2
34178,Wanted neon green.,34178,2
34178,Lol.,34178,2
34178,Their hunter green.,34178,2
34179,"UPDATE -- After washing these ONE time, the small straps have come off.",34179,2
34179,"I could sew these back on, but it's frustrating.",34179,2
34179,The stitching lacks quality.,34179,2
34179,"I really love the design, but I would purchase this style from another manufacturer.",34179,2
34179,"-------------
This product is just as I expected.",34179,2
34179,I purchased these to wear under low-cut tops for an extra interesting layer.,34179,2
34179,"It's very lightweight and thin, so I wouldn't wear it alone.",34179,2
34179,It's not very supportive but it would be perfect to wear to yoga class.,34179,2
34179,I really love it.,34179,2
34179,I would purchase these in other colors as well!,34179,2
34180,very very cheap...dont bother.,34180,2
34180,The zippers did not wok and split open when in the zipped mode,34180,2
34181,Arrived quickly but the tentacle's metal snapped in half during the first 4 minutes of wear.,34181,2
34181,It was difficult to get on as well,34181,2
34182,"I was so excited to get this in the mail, but when I tried it on it was too small and the lining was WAY to short even for a swim cover-up.",34182,2
34182,"I'm 5'8"" and it fit more like a tunic and less like dress.",34182,2
34182,"I ended up giving it to my friend, who's a little shorter than me, and she loves it.",34182,2
34183,"Runs small, made in China.",34183,2
34183,Shipment took too long.,34183,2
34183,Asked for a small but is is a Chinese small.,34183,2
34184,Yes it is a  very  pretty  ring.,34184,2
34184,However it says it's  sterling  silver and  it isn't  they make  you  think  it is by putting  a  stamp  on  it but I assure  you  it isn't  real... Now shipping  was fast and  the  stone  is beautiful  and  shinny just  wish  I  would  have  known  the  band sucks.,34184,2
34185,"I didn't like the fit of this dress, it was too big and way to flowy.",34185,2
34185,I ordered about 10 dresses to try for a wedding.,34185,2
34185,I love the fact that they have free returns and free shipping so I can do my trying on at home and then just mail back at no cost if they didn't fit!,34185,2
34186,"I have a closet full Carhartts in the exact same size and cut, but these were both too small and too short.",34186,2
34187,the lace flapping under your armpits is weird.,34187,2
34187,and the lace on the chest doesn't lay down well.,34187,2
34187,the arms are also kinda snug and don't drop around the wrist as it does int he picture.,34187,2
34187,maybe i would've needed to buy a bigger size for that effect....which no doubt would have made the lace on the chest even more loose.,34187,2
34188,The shirt material seems cheap and very thin.,34188,2
34188,The iron-on graphic started to peel off after the first washing.,34188,2
34188,"If this was a $20 shirt it wouldn't bother me so much, but for the price I paid it is unacceptable.",34188,2
34188,"Also, what's with the stupid trading cards that came with it?",34188,2
34188,Overall very disappointed.,34188,2
34188,Don't waste your money...,34188,2
34189,"Great pants... had to cut my own hole where there should be a hole, but otherwise, great fit.",34189,2
34189,After washing them they shrunk so much that I can't even wear them anymore.,34189,2
34189,They are 6 inches too short now!,34189,2
34190,The quality is wonderful but the sizing is way off,34190,2
34191,Small but gorgeous,34191,2
34192,Really cheap material.,34192,2
34192,I wish the coat hung like it looks in the photos.,34192,2
34193,Took forever to come a little small but it's cute,34193,2
34194,This hat was way to small for my head.,34194,2
34194,"I'd say I have a pretty average sized dome, most adjustable hats I snap with all the holes filled.",34194,2
34194,It was also not as structured as it looked in the photo.,34194,2
34195,"If this were to be a real one size shirt, then someone wearing a size 4 would look awesome in it.",34195,2
34195,"This is not 1 size fits all, it does however look like the pic.",34195,2
34195,"If I were 4 inches shorter and 50 lb lighter, there is a possibility that it would be great.",34195,2
34195,"But, since I am neither, this is total money wasted.",34195,2
34196,Because the shirt was coming from China I ordered up a size.,34196,2
34196,and its way too large.,34196,2
34196,the fabric I received has no stretch at all.,34196,2
34196,I have to wear something under it for coverage and arm holes are huge.,34196,2
34197,Poor quality :(,34197,2
34198,Made small,34198,2
34199,"LOOKS beautiful and Stunning and you can feel everything align as if you are in ultimate power :)  However, I ware mine about 4 out of 7 days on the average.",34199,2
34199,THE DOWN (which stinks because has to do what they have to do)  I had 4 break within the past 6 months!,34199,2
34199,BUMMER and its always the same break on the Crystal right down the middle EVERYTIME - I will NOT be ordering because obviously to tell,34199,2
34200,Wish this would have been thicker.,34200,2
34200,"I can get Pashminas at Kohls for 40% off similar to this price, however they are made much better",34200,2
34201,"The purse itself is great, love the room and different compartments.",34201,2
34201,The only color I would buy is black though.,34201,2
34201,The rest of the colors look cheap.,34201,2
34201,I bought a bunch of these in different colors for my kids teachers for Christmas.,34201,2
34201,They didn't come on time and only the black ones were something I would use.,34201,2
34201,So I use the black one I bought and I love it.,34201,2
34202,This coat looks great but is really not meant for the cold weather.,34202,2
34202,The down/feather insulation is pretty much absent in certain areas of the coat.,34202,2
34202,I put it over a nightshade lamp and it shows the whole story clearly.,34202,2
34203,Not long enough!,34203,2
34203,Made for small frames about five feet tall,34203,2
34204,"Fit very small, very poor quality.",34204,2
34205,It's being returned.,34205,2
34205,"I'm 5'4"" and the inseam is way to high.",34205,2
34205,I'm not big chested by any stretch in a C Cup and I couldn't cover enough so back it goes.,34205,2
34206,Saw this bag and thought it looked great.,34206,2
34206,"Shipping was FAST, with PRIME.",34206,2
34206,"Problem was, the SMELL of this plastic-leather is too strong for me.",34206,2
34206,"It is decently made, but I think it looks TOO plastic and it was TOO small.",34206,2
34206,I expected a larger purse pocket.,34206,2
34206,"Also, since this said ""VINTAGE"" I thought the ""pleather"" would be softer, like an actual vintage leather bag would be, but this is rigid and stiff.",34206,2
34206,"I returned it right after I got it, but I did take some photos.",34206,2
34206,"If they made other sizes, used a material that was softer and didn't have that horrible smell, it would be a bag I'd probably keep.",34206,2
34207,"Too smal,not as advertised",34207,2
34208,"Cute, but gives you a camel-toe in the front, feels like a wedgie up front too you gotta adjust it to make it comfortable.",34208,2
34208,"Not too tight or loose, order your regular size.",34208,2
34209,I bought this based off the reviews.,34209,2
34209,It fits terrible!,34209,2
34209,I bought a large when I normally wear a small or medium.,34209,2
34209,This doesn't cover my boobs at all!,34209,2
34209,I wear a size 6 and cup size 34 D. The bottom is extremely baggy and the top isn't big enough to cover my chest.,34209,2
34209,The fabric is thicker and the collar is a secure closure.,34209,2
34209,The fit is so awkward.,34209,2
34209,It will cost more to return so I'm keeping it.,34209,2
34209,If you're  c cup or smaller this may look decent.,34209,2
34210,I love the ombr look to these pants but I must have not read the material because I thought they were cotton but they are not.,34210,2
34211,It did not fit at all like expected and was not nearly as flattering as the photos make it seem to be,34211,2
34212,Have to touch it several times and push on it hard to get screen on.,34212,2
34212,Sorry I bought it.,34212,2
34213,Lenses are too big.,34213,2
34213,I look like I have one of those 70's pair of glasses with the huge lenses on lol.,34213,2
34213,"Also, they don't fit snug against the face.",34213,2
34213,They stick out a little.,34213,2
34213,But for $12 I guess they are that bad.,34213,2
34214,I read the reviews that said it is sized smaller.,34214,2
34214,I normally wear a medium so I ordered a large.,34214,2
34214,But this is more like a girls size large.,34214,2
34214,I could barely put it on.,34214,2
34214,Also this shirt is much shorter than what the picture shows.,34214,2
34214,The sleeves are short too.,34214,2
34214,It's a cute shirt but the sizing is way off.,34214,2
34215,Not very quality fabric.,34215,2
34215,Very cheap looking.,34215,2
34216,It's alright but doesn't fit me,34216,2
34217,The worst material I have purchased at Amazon,34217,2
34218,"Disappointed  in fit,  used  measurements  and still  was way too small",34218,2
34219,Was suppose to be new.,34219,2
34219,Tags were not even attached and was only one.,34219,2
34219,I believe this was used.,34219,2
34220,Too small can't wear.,34220,2
34221,Makes you look like you're pregnant,34221,2
34222,Kept it for my girlfriend.,34222,2
34222,I could not even put it on even though I choose the size according to the size chart.,34222,2
34222,Like to design but you may want to buy 2 size above recommendation!,34222,2
34223,It looks nice but the crisscross straps in the back are difficult and it runs small,34223,2
34224,"it looked way better in the picture ...,, i ordered a small and turned out there small was like an extra large,, but the tag on the dress still said small.",34224,2
34225,Cool belt - way too long to what it says the size is.,34225,2
34226,I liked the dress just not on my body...,34226,2
34226,It will show every lump and bump on your body... A little see through... You must have a flat tummy to wear something like this..,34226,2
34226,I'm 5'6 and 140lbs so don't consider myself fat.,34226,2
34227,"Not anywhere near the world's softest socks, and quite thin.",34227,2
34227,Very over priced for not being what was expected.,34227,2
34228,Rather disappointed as I chose size 36 as described in size chart but ended up too big.,34228,2
34229,way to small I am a 3xl and this was like a medium,34229,2
34230,looks clunky.,34230,2
34230,lots of metal.,34230,2
34230,you see more metal than you do diamonds.,34230,2
34230,"i took it to my jeweler who confirmed it was incredible value, definitely better than they could give me.",34230,2
34230,it just didn't sparkle like a diamond bracelet should.,34230,2
34230,i ended up purchasing a different/more expensive bracelet with better diamond clarity and less metal - this really made a difference.,34230,2
34230,One more thing - the links were very stiff - some of them were stuck together and you had to manually move them.,34230,2
34230,"I imagine that over time things would loosen up, but at the same time this isn't something most people would wear everyday.",34230,2
34231,They are pretty post earrings.,34231,2
34231,But the backs don't fit!,34231,2
34231,One was too big & the other was too small.,34231,2
34231,I felt like Goldilocks.... That's why I gave it only 2 stars.,34231,2
34231,Backs are very important.,34231,2
34231,"Was going to send them back , but I make simple jewelry for fun & had backs that fit (many craft stores supply them in their ""jewelry findings"" department, so I didn't.",34231,2
34232,Fabric is not as dark and shiny as the picture.,34232,2
34232,It is more like a dull purple and feels like a t-shirt material.,34232,2
34232,Not the elegant dress I expected.,34232,2
34233,Way too small but looked cute on my 10 yr old daughter.,34233,2
34234,"Looking back, this turned out to be one of those ""silly"" purchases while I was pregnant.",34234,2
34234,"I didn't use it nearly as much as I thought I'd ""need to"".",34234,2
34234,You can easily create something similar by cutting up a tank top.,34234,2
34234,Save your money for comfortable wireless bras-- now THATS something I'm glad I got while pregnant and now as a mama!,34234,2
34235,The recommendations of size doesn't match in real life.,34235,2
34236,Very long brim.,34236,2
34236,Not what I was expecting/hoping.,34236,2
34237,"on the + side - yes, it looks nice & feels good
BUT so what - when pulling on the pants is a struggle because the leg opening is extremely narrow (my feet are size 11 1/2, which should be no great problem) AND the pants' leg width is so snug that I had to all nd pull (and my legs aren't at all heavy).",34237,2
34237,AND would you believe - there is no slit where any sensible men's wear would have an opening.,34237,2
34237,Meaning I have to pull down the pants in order to urinate.,34237,2
34237,whatcrap!,34237,2
34237,"Of course, made in China.",34237,2
34237,If only Amazon and others - if they must sell Cinese wares - would tell us.,34237,2
34238,It arrived on time but the ring was way too small.,34238,2
34238,(It barely fit on my pinky.,34238,2
34238,I bruised my ring finger trying to put it on.),34238,2
34239,Material is very scratchy and uncomfortable.,34239,2
34239,It also wrinkles easily.,34239,2
34240,Not sure why all the rave reviews on this hat.,34240,2
34240,Seems like it needs contant adjusting to look right.,34240,2
34240,Very loose knit so it isn't really that warm.,34240,2
34240,Ill probly give this to a friend.,34240,2
34241,"Good fit, size etc but cheap quality.",34241,2
34241,After one wash I started seeing holes in them.,34241,2
34242,too big,34242,2
34243,Not the gauzy cotton I wanted,34243,2
34244,cheap materials.,34244,2
34244,"Cute shape, but very light, insubstantial plastic.",34244,2
34244,Disappointed.,34244,2
34245,Very cute.,34245,2
34245,But I ordered this 3 sizes bigger and it was still to small,34245,2
34246,I bought one size larger than what I would have normally done and it still shrunk down a couple of sizes.,34246,2
34246,The cotton is too thin and not the quality I had come to expect from Jockey.,34246,2
34246,I should have taken the other reviews seriously.,34246,2
34246,The brief fits well and would still be OK if it weren't for the unreliability of the sizing.,34246,2
34246,I will not be buying again.,34246,2
34246,I bought a Calvin Klein cotton classic brief set of 4 at the same time as this set and I like those briefs better than the Jockey both on fit/comfort and price.,34246,2
34247,graphic has a star burst flaw in the plastic lens.,34247,2
34247,This is a highly reconnized graphic for unicorn people.,34247,2
34247,I could not give it as a gift because she knows her unicorn stuff.,34247,2
34247,Inexspensive gift not worth mailing back for new item to be sent to me.,34247,2
34248,"Colors are beautiful, very tight, material is smothering.",34248,2
34249,It's not a bad sweatshirt but quality does n I t match the price.,34249,2
34249,It's more like a $20 sweatshirt.,34249,2
34249,Expected MUCH better quality for the money..,34249,2
34250,The dress arrived fairly quickly and the fit was fine but I did not like the back.,34250,2
34250,It was scooped out so low that my 3yr old's whole bottom practically shows.,34250,2
34250,I stitched it up on my own which made it fit snug.,34250,2
34250,It was so inexpensive that I decided to just keep it around for her to wear around the house after baths or the pool rather than sending it back.,34250,2
34251,Not very flattering.,34251,2
34251,Camel toe.,34251,2
34251,Tie does not really tie...,34251,2
34252,I purchased this after buying a short shrug / poncho from this company that I am in love with.,34252,2
34252,"I thought since I liked the shrug, I'd also love the cardigan but this just looks ill fitting and sloppy.",34252,2
34252,"While I like the light, open weave material I had to return  simply based on the horrible fit.",34252,2
34252,"For reference, I'm 54 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28 waist 34 and ordered this in black/ free size.",34252,2
34252,I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.,34252,2
34252,"I paid full price for this item and wasn't compensated in any way but would appreciate a ""yes"" click if you found my review helpful :)",34252,2
34253,"This dress looked really cute but was pretty disproportionate, tight around the arms and legs, and cheap-ish material.",34253,2
34253,"I gave it to my friend who is smaller than me and it fit her weirdly too, so wasn't just a matter of me ordering the wrong size.",34253,2
34254,runs very large and material not comfortable.,34254,2
34255,Hmmm the bottom is ok but the top is to small do not fit proper make your boobs looks all saggy,34255,2
34256,smaller than I anticipated.,34256,2
34256,my glasses are normal sized and just barely fit in this case.,34256,2
34256,I have to set them in the case just right or it won't close.,34256,2
34256,I'd go with a larger case next time.,34256,2
34257,the material looked cheap and gaudy,34257,2
34258,Material is cheap.,34258,2
34259,This sizing is a joke,34259,2
34260,Meeeh!,34260,2
34261,TOO LARGE!!!!,34261,2
34261,!,34261,2

34262,"I have a small face, but these are absolutely for kids.",34262,2
34263,"A very cute top, but unfortunately, the stitching is just plain awful.",34263,2
34263,"I'm going to try to fix all of the mistakes, but I can see this falling apart very quickly.",34263,2
34264,had  to  return  it,34264,2
34265,"Like several women's clothing options on Amazon, this is made for Asian frames or really small framed persons.",34265,2
34265,The photos are deceiving,34265,2
34266,Sizes are DEFINITELY ASIAN.,34266,2
34266,"I'm around 5'10"" and weight 135lbs, and I bought a medium, which has always fit me for other body suits.",34266,2
34266,"The crotch in this suit ended half way up my thigh, and the shoulders ended where my boobs began.",34266,2
34266,"Nice quality otherwise, but WAY too short.",34266,2
34266,"I don't want to buy a larger size just for height, for fear that it will be baggy on me.",34266,2
34267,It is ok,34267,2
34268,"Unfortunately, I ended up not wearing this skirt as intended.",34268,2
34268,"It's hard to see in the picture, but there is a section of about 4"" underneath the top 2 layers of tulle where you can see the gray lining.",34268,2
34268,"It's like the layers underneath started 4"" below the top 2 layers, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.",34268,2
34268,"It was really distracting to the look to have that band of gray visible, so I ended up wearing this underneath a different dress.",34268,2
34268,"It fit great and I got compliments on the color, but I was very disappointed that you could see the lining.",34268,2
34269,"Looked nice, but it broke while she was taking it off the very first time she wore it.",34269,2
34270,Good quality frame and lenses.,34270,2
34270,Problem is the nose bridge will block your view when looking to your driver side mirror.,34270,2
34270,The black bridge and brow is also distracting.,34270,2
34271,"Completely see through, so unless I wanted to offend all of those around me, I won't be wearing these.",34271,2
34272,Okay so I bought this for my husband.,34272,2
34272,We did not expect the hidden pocket to be so large or that it would as low as his crotch.,34272,2
34272,Not convinient to have important document get so low you have to dig it out of your private wares.,34272,2
34272,The fit was nice so he used it as regular underwear but to hold anything it was I convinient.,34272,2
34273,Band was heavy and hard to fasten.,34273,2
34273,Went a regular expansion band.,34273,2
34273,FYI.,34273,2
34273,If for any reason you have to return watch to Asus the orginal band must be in place!,34273,2
34274,"I knew they were thin walled (based on description).. they were about twice as thin as any other tunnels I have bought labeled ""thin walls""

34275,wasn't what I expected,34275,2

34280,"Cute shirt though,... Too bad it didn't fit.",34280,2
34281,The picture showed a strap for around the ankle.,34281,2
34281,The ones that came did not have one.,34281,2
34281,I returned them because they are not safe for little ones.,34281,2
34281,"Also, didn't seem worth what they cost",34281,2
34282,Too small and not the best quality.,34282,2
34283,These are super cute clothes but I didn't realize they were of cheap quality and being shipped from china.,34283,2
34284,They fell apart with in 6 months.,34284,2
34284,I have one remaining pair that I only wear if I'm going to be wearing leggings or other tight pants.,34284,2
34284,You get what you pay for I guess.,34284,2
34285,Nice dress but it was small,34285,2
34286,Looks nice.,34286,2
34286,Too bad the the strap broke after one day of use,34286,2
34287,The colors are not as pictured.,34287,2
34288,The shirt is almost a silk material and the color looks nothing like the picture.,34288,2
34288,Its much lighter than the picture almost pastel colors.,34288,2
34288,It also fits very strangely.,34288,2
34288,"Its wide around the bottom and flowy, but it is very tight at the hips and bust.",34288,2
34288,I would not recommended this shirt as its not good quality at all and fits very odd,34288,2
34289,Some of the threads connecting the beads on the shirt were torn.,34289,2
34290,This dress is way too small and I wasn't a big fan of the material.,34290,2
34290,I had to send it back.,34290,2
34291,Cheap fabric.,34291,2
34292,I should have read the other reviews before purchasing.,34292,2

34297,Way too small & looks different than photos.,34297,2
34297,One size if you're an X small!!,34297,2
34297,However the company got right back to me & refunded,34297,2
34298,Pretty small..didn't like the way it fit,34298,2
34299,I would advise you just to not buy this.,34299,2
34299,It looks so cute in the picture and I really wanted to like it.,34299,2
34299,"First off, it is so thin.",34299,2
34299,"Like, see your nips through it thin.",34299,2
34299,I would be afraid to wear it to the pool and get it wet for fear that someone would be able to see right through it.,34299,2
34299,The bottoms are just as thin with NO LINING whatsoever.,34299,2
34299,"I ordered my size according to the chart, and it is too big both in the top and the bottom.",34299,2
34299,"There is no support for your girls, so don't expect to look as sexy as the lady in the picture unless you are willing to wear another bra or something underneath - your going to need at least something to cover your nips so they aren't so obvious.",34299,2
34299,"Also, the high waisted shorts don't look like this.",34299,2
34299,Mine looked more like granny panties.,34299,2
34299,I'm not even kidding.,34299,2
34299,I was embarrased even to try it on in front of my hubby.,34299,2
34299,"The only way I can wear it is if I also wear another top and bottoms under these, and then what's the point?",34299,2
34299,It's just super thin and cheaply made and not worth your time or money.,34299,2
34299,LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE.,34299,2
34299,I paid full price for this BTW.,34299,2
34299,I really hope this helps you make a better decision.,34299,2
34300,Didn't look ike picture.,34300,2
34300,Broke 2nd day,34300,2
34301,Disappointed  I was really looking forward to wear this when I got it too small !,34301,2
34301,Not happy with this at all !,34301,2
34301,Run small!,34301,2
34302,Came very smoothed in the package and wasn't able to be straightened out.,34302,2
34302,"Also the glue for the pearls was stuck to the plastic bag and when I pulled it apart, pearls came off.",34302,2

34304,I bought two of these hats.,34304,2
34304,They are very different sizes.,34304,2
34304,One is too large and the other is too tight.,34304,2
34305,when things are made in China their sizes are not the same as ours,34305,2
34306,The button design is not as subtle as it seems to be in the picture.,34306,2
34306,"The folds that the button design is on top of are too wide and bulky, especially when compared to the picture.",34306,2
34306,"I bought this for my husband, we do not like this and would appreciate better sizing and more reliable advertising.",34306,2
34307,I bought an X-large and it feels huge on me.,34307,2
34307,I can't wear the shirt.,34307,2
34307,The arms don't look like the girl in the photo on me.,34307,2
34308,I did not like it so much as that I thought,34308,2
34309,I ordered these to have a good fit on my petite adult canines.,34309,2
34309,These seemed to be a middle of the road option as far as reviews to price.,34309,2
34309,It took forever to get them to fit decently even with practice.,34309,2
34309,"I had to end up shaving the sides down to even fit then there was the whole problem of the sealant you melt and put in there for the fitting, didn't work so great when you have to shave the sides down like it should.",34309,2
34309,After about 2 hrs of tweeting things and having to remold a few times to get a good seal these were decent looking enough for Halloween but definitely not for a realistic look if you look for more then a quick second at them in someone's mouth.,34309,2
34309,Luckily I only need them for Halloween time so it's good enough for me.,34309,2
34310,It's not as bright as the picture shows.,34310,2
34310,Doesn't look like it would last very long against tarnishing.,34310,2
34310,The charm is very heavy on it's thin chain.,34310,2
34311,"Too tight in the wasitband and because they are soooo highwaisted (almost to my ribs), they put pressure on my stomach - which actually makes me ill.",34311,2
34311,The fit theough the leg is very stretchy and nice but the top is much more rigid.,34311,2
34311,I'm definitely not keeping them.,34311,2
34311,"I'm an athletic build 5'3"" and 125lbs for reference and I got a small.",34311,2
34312,Size runs very small.,34312,2
34312,Lettering will probably come up with the first wash.,34312,2
34312,Cute but not the greatest quality.,34312,2
34313,CHEAP CRAP,34313,2
34314,It's nice good price but the plastic is weak broke in only 2 weeks of usage,34314,2
34315,Way too small and I bought a size larger than recommended.,34315,2
34315,The sleeves are really tight and it is very uncomfortable to wear.,34315,2
34315,Buy 2 sizes larger or a different brand.,34315,2
34316,i love the bag but the color isn't silver at all...its gold...if you want gold its perfect,34316,2
34317,Two out of 10 came with broken clasps.,34317,2

34318,Too small and did not fit my curves well.,34318,2
34318,No stretch in the material.,34318,2

34321,The fabric is extremely cheap.,34321,2
34321,Very light and almost see through.,34321,2
34321,Very cheap looking.,34321,2
34321,I'm a 16 and got the xxl.,34321,2
34321,Fits but my undergarments were showing.,34321,2
34321,I don't recommend.,34321,2
34322,Item is very flimsy.,34322,2
34323,"These are a super cute idea, as I wanted costume glasses for my son's Minion Halloween costume, but the plastic bridge across the nose was super hard and uncomfortable and I couldn't convince him to wear the glasses for more than 2 minutes.",34323,2
34324,"Loved it, unfortunately it was defective.",34324,2
34324,"Product has thumb gloves built into the sleeve, however the right sleeve wasn't finished, it appears that the arm was sewed on & not even seemed; as well as the missing thumb glove.",34324,2
34324,Would've gave 5 stars if it wasn't defective.,34324,2
34325,"The product came early, which I was really happy about until I opened the packaging.",34325,2
34325,"The jewelry peices were clearly glued on, you could see the dried clear glue in between the pieces.",34325,2
34325,"I have never worn the necklace, even from far away you can see the gross glue surrounding the necklace.",34325,2
34325,"The glue must have been hot glue because it was near impossible to get off, small peices would come off but the larger chunks of glue were completely stuck.",34325,2
34325,"The necklace itself would have been amazing without the glue, everything else seemed perfect and nice and shiny.",34325,2
34325,I am giving this product two stars instead of one because the rest of the necklace was perfect!,34325,2
34325,:),34325,2
34326,The bags are advertised as water proof.,34326,2
34326,They are not!,34326,2
34326,The closure is a poorly sewn strip of velcro which was already coming apart upon delivery.,34326,2
34326,"These bags are nothing more than a over priced ""Dust Bag"" I do not recommend this item to protect valuable handbags.",34326,2
34326,"The delivery was prompt however, the item is not as described!",34326,2
34327,"Does not look as good in person as in the picture, In the picture looks royal blue, but in person looks the same color as blue jeans.",34327,2
34328,These run incredibly small,34328,2
34329,Cute but I ordered up 3 sizes and the fit was all wrong.,34329,2
34329,"I also didn't like the white, see-through, mesh material under the skirt.",34329,2
34330,"Way too small and not like the picture in many different ways, I donated this to goodwill but mostly I remember that the collar was not attached at the top as shown so it was just a deep v, making for a very awkward fit along with being too short to cover your ass and riding up your crotch.",34330,2
34330,Just an unattractive piece all around.,34330,2
34331,Champagne price for beer quality.,34331,2
34332,Way to large!,34332,2
34333,I had high hopes for these since they were super cute.,34333,2
34333,I got them in the mail very quickly too.,34333,2
34333,They are just very thin and fold and wrap over themselves.,34333,2
34333,Not high quality whatsoever.,34333,2
34334,"The bottom for as expected regarding size, however the top was too small.",34334,2
34334,The model appears to have large breast but this top is not made for anyone with heavy breast.,34334,2
34334,Not only did it not cover the breast but guaranteed spillage.,34334,2
34334,The fabric was very thin as well.,34334,2
34334,Disappointed.,34334,2
34335,THE EXTRA LARGE FIT LIKE A MEDIUM.,34335,2
34335,"NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY, WAS NOT A SWEATER , SOME OTHER MATERIAL...",34335,2
34336,I should have heeded the warnings of the other reviews; this hat is way too small.,34336,2

34337,Disappointing.,34337,2
34338,I wasn't too happy with these actually...,34338,2
34338,The product is of good quality but they don't stick very well at all...,34338,2
34338,It feels like a wet sticky adhesive and it's kind of gross to be honest...,34338,2
34338,I made sure my skin was dry and I didn't have any lotion on like it said to do and when I put them on they started to come off immediately...,34338,2
34338,I tried several times to position them differently and still no success...,34338,2
34338,I didn't even get to use them for what I needed them for and had to go bra-less anyway...,34338,2
34338,I guess I can't be too mad seeing as that I got what I paid for at 7.99...,34338,2
34338,Disappointing none the less...,34338,2
34339,didnt fit granddaughter is very thin and only a year and a half old.,34339,2

34340,"Very pretty, but very cheaply made.",34340,2
34340,First time I tried to put it on the clasp came right off so now I am trying to find something not as cheaply made to use for clasp so I do not have to worry about it breaking.,34340,2
34340,Hopefully after I fix it the rest of it will hold together so I can finally wear it.,34340,2
34341,".Material was not as originally pictured,, very cheap looking and the sizing was way off.",34341,2
34341,This will go to Goodwill on next trip _ maybe somebody can use it.. Also has nothing to do with the photo adjacent to this present form.,34341,2
34342,This tool is extremely flimsy and I broke it trying to size a 22mm band on a Grand diver.,34342,2
34342,It is certainly not up to the task of taking on larger bands and is not recommended for anyone trying to deal with larger bands.,34342,2
34342,I say stick to using the hammer and a punch to remove the pins and you'll be just fine.,34342,2
34342,So far I haven't found a single tool like this that I can recommend for regular use.,34342,2

34367,My son is currently wearing $15 champion brand shoes from a local discount shoe store.,34367,2
34367,"I prefer these over any minimalist shoe I have tried, as the sole folds in half at any point with minimal pressure.",34367,2

34372,I have been buying Havainas for over 10 years now and it seems as if the sizing is all wrong.,34372,2
34372,I initially ordered the same size as my current ones that I am replacing.,34372,2
34372,They were way too big.,34372,2
34372,So I then ordered the size down and they are too small.,34372,2
34372,Something has happened with the sizing.,34372,2
34372,I am not a happy customer right now.,34372,2

34379,I cannot run wearing these bras.,34379,2

34382,Some parts of the thread are attached to the fabric no where near the seam!,34382,2

34396,decoration is not secured very well so I had to sew them to ensure they would not be pulled off,34396,2
34397,This maybe the cheapest item of clothing I've ever purchased that may be worth exactly the price.,34397,2
34397,The fabric makes me certain I should stay away from even the smallest of flames.,34397,2
34397,It's thin and prone to static.,34397,2
34397,The cheap stitching started unraveling before I even tried it and was so uneven some segments didn't even get hemmed.,34397,2

34415,"I will wear the pieces separate to make them work, but I would not buy the outfit again.",34415,2
34415,I'm pretty sure the positive comments on this product were from those who received the outfit for free in exchange for their review.,34415,2

34434,"Whatever the seller writes, these are definitely NOT wool socks.",34434,2
34434,More like a poly blend of some sort.,34434,2
34434,Sent it right back,34434,2
34435,It is an iron on plastic picture.,34435,2
34435,Do not dry in the dryer and wash inside out on delicate called.,34435,2

34436,It is very thin and the colors are not what is shown on the website.,34436,2
34436,"I ordered the Azalea Stripe because of the vibrant pinks, but what I received has a very yellowish cast to it.",34436,2
34436,It comes across as more orange/yellow than pink.,34436,2
34436,"The stripes do not match up on one side of the bottom border, so it looks kind of crooked.",34436,2
34436,"I specifically asked if the robe would be see through and two people said no, but guess what?",34436,2
34436,YOU CAN.,34436,2
34436,It's too thin.,34436,2
34436,I wanted something to be able to wear around the house by itself.,34436,2
34436,This is not what I wanted at all and I shopped around for at least a month comparing similar items.,34436,2
34436,They should also show it on a model for a better idea of what it really looks like.,34436,2
34436,"However, I was able to return it easily at no additional charge and received a full refund.",34436,2
34437,This shirt doesn't look like the picture.,34437,2
34437,"At first it was okay because I liked how it was a little lower than my hips but when I washed the shirt, it shrunk and is around my belly area now.",34437,2
34437,But the shirt doesn't look anything like the picture,34437,2
34438,Package came quickly but sizes run small.,34438,2
34438,I ordered two different sizes just in case and the top rolls down on both pairs.,34438,2
34439,It fit big and o ordered it my size so recommend to get one size smaller,34439,2
34440,Ordered a medium but it is too small.,34440,2
34440,Didn't say it was coming from china.,34440,2
34441,The fabric is pretty comfy.,34441,2
34441,"Otherwise, baggy, and yet showed every flaw, like some kind of magic designed to make you unattractive.",34441,2
34441,"I have a small pooch, like most women, and this thing, while being super lose in the back, was tight around it.",34441,2
34441,"So your back is undefined and your waist looks huge, while it appears your belly is sticking out.",34441,2
34441,I have no idea how.,34441,2
34441,"For reference I'm 5' 10'' and a size 12 and ordered an XXL, I wanted something loose fitting.",34441,2
34441,"It covered my bum, but that's about it.",34441,2
34441,I guess only buy this if you have a perfectly flat tummy and/or are pregnant.,34441,2
34442,The quality is really bad.,34442,2
34442,I didn't like it,34442,2
34443,"They fit as expected, but the arms and legs shrink and get shorter and shorter with each wash.",34443,2
34443,I kept ordering a larger size hoping eventually I would get the pj;s large enough that shrinkage would not be a problem.,34443,2
34443,I was wrong.,34443,2
34444,"Nicer for a slim fit, but the sleeves could use an inch or two more.",34444,2
34444,Stretches out of shape at the sleeve cuffs and waist.,34444,2
34444,"Wondering once washed, will it shrink.",34444,2
34444,"If it does, it will become unwearable.",34444,2
34445,I bought necklace for my boss as a Christmas gift and also gave her a bracelet (I kept the silver bracelet ) she wore both items the next day (today 12/21) and the beads on her necklace fell from the chain.,34445,2
34445,"I was so embarrassed, and I did tell her I would exchange but she was so nice that she fixed the necklace on her own BUT still the shade of red on my face of sheer embarrassment has not left my face.",34445,2
34445,So disappointed!,34445,2
34446,This product was described as a lunch bag although it is not insulated and is very small.,34446,2
34446,No zipper closure and just overall disappointed in this product.,34446,2
34447,"This was definitely not a size large, not even a medium!",34447,2
34447,!,34447,2
34448,Just started using this a couple weeks ago.,34448,2
34448,"It's lightweight which I wanted, but quality of pockets lacking.",34448,2
34448,There's already a huge hole in one of the front pockets.,34448,2
34448,"Good for light use, but not for everyday use.",34448,2
34449,"It was too small to wear comfortably, but a larger size would likely have been a tent.",34449,2
34449,"It's very unflattering and baggy around the middle, as the waistline is not contoured.",34449,2
34449,This item has a strong chemical smell and was clearly made by a machine.,34449,2
34450,I have a skinny barely four year old and this was so small that it reminded me of putting her in a leotard and tights!,34450,2
34451,The tights are warm in cold temperatures.,34451,2
34451,They stretched quickly so felt very loose on the leg.,34451,2
34451,The waistband relaxed quickly as well so they crept down the hip.,34451,2
34451,I wanted to love them but don't.,34451,2
34452,so so small,34452,2
34453,Nice material and look of pants.,34453,2
34453,"Wanted to love, but it has a weird amount of loose material at the pubic bone which on me gave the ""camel toe"" and impression of my whole pubic area was bulging, though those body parts are 1"" lower.",34453,2
34453,I just couldn't live with that look...  returned,34453,2
34454,way too small.,34454,2
34454,for a  child size,34454,2
34455,I should have read the customer reviews before buying because I like the looks.,34455,2
34455,"I had them about ten days, when the screw few out of the and the arm fell off.",34455,2
34455,I was lucky and found all parts and my assistant put it back together (because I'd need glasses to do it).,34455,2
34455,"Then a couple days later which was yesterday, one of the arms just snapped.",34455,2
34455,I am not hard on things nor did I drop them or misuse them in any way.,34455,2
34455,Now because I don't have time to go to the store I have taped them together.,34455,2
34455,It's a drag.,34455,2
34455,Love the look - but the actual thing doesn't work.,34455,2
34456,Looks just like the pic except for the fit.,34456,2
34456,Seriously goes up to my collar bone.,34456,2
34456,And then kinda loose.,34456,2
34456,I thought it would fit more like the pic shown.,34456,2
34456,However I can't complain it's so cheap.,34456,2
34456,That's why it got 2 stars,34456,2
34457,Sizing waaaay off.,34457,2
34457,"According to their size chart, I would need a 2x.",34457,2
34457,(Wanted to make sure it roomy for sleeping).,34457,2
34457,I can say my size 3x daughter could wear a 2x.,34457,2
34457,"Unfortunately,  a 1x would still be too large and a xl is too small.",34457,2
34457,What about us ''inbetweeners''?,34457,2
34458,much smaller than expected,34458,2
34459,"It's a cute mask, but as soon as I was going to put it on, the elastic band came loose.",34459,2
34459,"It can be fixed with a glue gun, but meh... Other than that, it's okay.",34459,2
34460,These were alot smaller than normal size.,34460,2
34460,Very disappointed,34460,2
34461,Rather disappointing.,34461,2
34461,"They're nicely priced, virtually cost zip... but besides the point.",34461,2
34461,There's always glasses out there that are dirt cheap & can actually be fantastic.,34461,2
34461,"Anyhow, I'm a typical Sunglasses ""nut"".",34461,2
34461,"As of now, I currently have about a dozen to a dozen & a 1/2 pairs.",34461,2
34461,"Ranging from 3 pairs in particular RayBan/MauiJ./Smith & then I've about 4 or 5, ... $18-$35 pairs.",34461,2
34461,"And a few scattered about, that are anywhere from 7.99- $15, a few I own are the ""as seen on tv""- HD Vision sunglasses.",34461,2
34461,"Regular unisex square/rectangular shaped lenses, & they're what got me obsessed w/ HD/Brown &/or Gradient Brown lenses.",34461,2
34461,Literally the 3 that I have are all the same.,34461,2
34461,"One pair I caused the inner part of the lenses to become all distorted & slightly ruined but still usable, do to me over using lens spray cleaner (I now only literally only use lukewarm water and a tiny bit of mild soap, just as they always recommend!).",34461,2
34461,"But I then went back to rite aid and grabbed 2 more pairs-@9.99 plus I get 20% off most stuff there, @7.99 ya can't go wrong.",34461,2
34461,"I started wearing those around the house day & night, I mean call me crazy, but I was/still am in love w/ how crystal clear, crisp, clean & vibrant these things are, my eyes are sensitive to lights all the time, so to explain the indoor wearing, & the gradient brown color are almost perfect due to not being that dark, hence comfortably wearing them all day, in/out, so finally, what I'm getting at is one night watching tv, & having a year old 1080p HD w/all bells/whistles, I'm used to a beautiful picture to begin with, so at one moment, I needed to go use the restroom, as&iacute; got up I took off the glasses to rub my eyes, then a quick glance at the tv WithOut glasses on, I realized WOW, the pic looked a bit crappier, then I put the glasses back on for a sec, & to my great surprise, they make an already great tv picture That-Much-Greater.",34461,2
34461,"Oh & btw, they're really decent sunglasses as well.",34461,2
34461,"Now sorry for my babbling, back to these X-loops, they're almost, pretty much the same, or fairly close however they're just a shade enough darker, that make me not able to wear them as long indoors, & 1 last thing, this is a bummer, but they are honestly not very clear, and ""free of distortion"", I'm talking, through zero fault of the owner, they like many others out there are just I suppose not made very well, when you've a clean lens and the view has a few kinks in it.",34461,2
34461,These were my SECOND try at owning (X-Loops).,34461,2
34461,oh well.,34461,2
34461,It's not the end of the world.,34461,2
34461,But my advice- buy another brand of HD,34461,2
34462,Bow was too heavy when wet and looked odd.,34462,2
34463,"Very thin and cheap material, the band at the waist does not tuck down so the tag in the back hangs out.",34463,2
34464,"It does it's job, but is not flattering at all and the fabric breaks down with the first wash. You can mix and match tops with it to extend your wardrobe, but the white top starts to discolor quickly--not stains, but something in the fabric starts to leave discolorations with each wash.",34464,2
34465,"I ordered two, they came in quicker than expected, are too light weight for the clasp hardware, hook on for left handed, three leather lace strands are gray and the owl strand had come apart.",34465,2
34465,Cute for young girls.,34465,2
34465,Cheap in many ways.,34465,2
34465,You can make them a lot better using items from the local craft store.,34465,2
34465,I would not order again.,34465,2
34466,good,34466,2
34467,If I knew this came from China I would have ordered elsewhere.,34467,2
34467,No where on item did it say ships from China.,34467,2
34467,Bought XXL I wear XL this shirts fits L. Will return,34467,2
34468,Very poor quality shirt.,34468,2
34468,Washed it once and couldn't wear it again.,34468,2
34469,"I wear a large hat, but this one did not fit the way I like them to.",34469,2
34469,The snap brim is very small.,34469,2
34470,"size too small,",34470,2
34471,"It's difficult to find cute, fun, & stylish plus size clothes.",34471,2
34471,I really wanted this shirt to be all the cuteness as seen in the picture.,34471,2
34471,"But, it is rather cheaply made out of a rather thin material.",34471,2
34471,It is cut smaller than the indicated size.,34471,2
34471,"And, the ""glitter"" wording literally looks as if a child used glue & glitter.",34471,2
34472,Very cheap looking.,34472,2
34472,I don't think I will be wearing it.,34472,2
34473,The only problem I have with this watch (besides that it is too large for me) is that you really have a difficult time seeing its hands.,34473,2
34474,Fit a little small but came falling apart,34474,2
34475,Although the dress is nice it looks nothing like the picture it is very deceiving!!,34475,2
34475,Disappointed about that,34475,2
34476,"Runs small, fit like yoga pants....for men",34476,2
34477,"Notwithstanding the beadwork at the top, this dress is nothing like the picture.",34477,2
34477,My dress came in white and black not cream and black as pictured.,34477,2
34477,"Also, the fabric is super cheap on the bottom and has little threads coming out already from the bottom seam and I just received the dress.",34477,2
34477,I paid for expedited shipping and it came almost 2 weeks later.,34477,2
34477,"Well my event is tonight and after receiving this dress in the mail on Wednesday, I had to take a day off work to find another dress for my gala.",34477,2
34477,I now have paid for two dresses and spent time that I didn't have.,34477,2
34477,This is why I shopped for a dress on-line in the first place.,34477,2
34477,Anyways save yourself the hassle and time and do not buy any gowns on-line.,34477,2
34477,I went to a large retailer (higher end) and got 20% off and the selection of dresses was incredible.,34477,2
34477,"So, I paid around the same price for my new dress.",34477,2
34478,Too small and it fits short.,34478,2
34478,Looks like it's for a really short woman.,34478,2
34479,Cute but too small,34479,2
34480,Very big and baggy for the size,34480,2
34481,The waistband is as wide as the shoulders.,34481,2
34481,"If you're as wide as you are tall, this won't be a problem, but for most people it won't have a good fit.",34481,2
34481,Not up to the Grundens quality I'm used to.,34481,2
34482,Style is good but fit is not.,34482,2
34482,Extremely low rise in the crotch and drawstring does not go through the waste.,34482,2
34482,Shorts cannot be tightened properly or pulled up because of this.,34482,2
34482,And forget about bending over.,34482,2
34482,"I'm 6'2"" and 225 lbs and ordered the XL...",34482,2
34483,The material is not as nice as the picture shows.,34483,2
34483,This is supposed to be long and it barely covers my bottom.,34483,2
34483,I am 5'0 and bought a small.,34483,2
34483,I can use it with jeans but this is not why I was buying it for.,34483,2
34484,quality is crap,34484,2
34485,the size of the shirts was way too large,34485,2
34486,Sizes are way off,34486,2
34487,broke right away,34487,2
34488,Buttons fell off after 2nd wash,34488,2
34489,It's exactly as pictured if you're looking for a longer bar this is not it,34489,2
34490,"The material is very cheap, Halloween type shiny material.",34490,2
34490,"It is not cotton blend but very spandex, even latex looking.",34490,2
34490,No way this looks professional or cute.,34490,2
34490,It's so shimmery like a superhero costume.,34490,2
34490,Could have found something better at Ross honestly for the price.,34490,2
34490,Lesson learned,34490,2
34491,warm sweater but very bulky and unflattering.,34491,2
34491,I wear it around the house as PJ's,34491,2
34492,Too big for my waist.,34492,2
34493,I purchased this shoe because my son has wide feet.,34493,2
34493,This is not wide at all!,34493,2
34493,I'm so disappointed.,34493,2
34494,very short for an extra large.,34494,2
34494,will prob send it back.,34494,2
34495,The product was smaller than expected and more see through than I liked.,34495,2
34495,I returned this item.,34495,2
34496,Way to small even with the right measurements..,34496,2
34497,After a day of my daughter wearing them to school they started to fall apart.,34497,2
34498,"Design was nice, but scarf was flimsy.",34498,2
34499,"Pretty, but cheap, i ordered back in July, after wearing it almost daily the piece on the pendant that holds the necklace snapped off completely, and sent the whole thing shattering to the floor.",34499,2
34499,Its ok bc you get what you pay for.,34499,2
34499,The silver was already rubbing off and turning pink.,34499,2
34499,Needless to say my replacement is not coming from here.,34499,2
34500,"The fit was fine, but the words were spelt wrong.",34500,2
34500,"Instead of ""first class"", it says ""frist class""",34500,2
34501,I sent them back.,34501,2
34501,Did not fit,34501,2
34502,"This dress looked very good online, however when I recieved it, the dress ran smaller than expected as well as the design is a little odd.",34502,2
34502,For example I thought I had the dress inside out as there is extra material on the top of the dress that looks like seams.,34502,2
34502,I would not recommend this dress unless you have sewing skills to fix the Top of the dress.,34502,2
34502,I will say the color was spot on.,34502,2
34503,Color faded after first wash.,34503,2
34504,"Cheap, strange strong smell, thin, unlined.",34504,2
34505,This dress is huge and frumpy.,34505,2
34505,It is not flattering to body shape for a t-shirt dress.,34505,2
34505,The quality is okay.,34505,2
34505,If your going to buy this product buy it one or two sizes smaller than you normally would!,34505,2
34505,I got a size small and it completely drowns me.,34505,2
34505,One side of my dress is also a lot longer than the other side!,34505,2
34506,"mediocre quality, fits large and baggy, ruined after washed",34506,2
34507,Looks nice but sized for  petite people with no bust.,34507,2
34508,"The fit was OK in the legs, however the waist was too short, they they rolling down.",34508,2
34508,So if you have belly not a good fit,34508,2
34509,to small and tight at shoulders,34509,2
34510,"I like this cami, however the ""lace"" at the top and bottom began to unravel after the first washing.",34510,2
34510,"It appears that the elastic woven into the ""lace"" is breaking down.",34510,2
34510,Other than this problem it is a comfortable cami.,34510,2
34511,"arms are very snug,",34511,2
34512,With only one stud it's not enough to support the piece.,34512,2
34512,It flops and is unwearable.,34512,2
34513,Lovely but turned green the second time I wore it.,34513,2
34514,ITS HUGE !,34514,2
34514,Uncomfortable and cumbersome to wear.,34514,2
34515,One huge plaid table cloth is what this is.,34515,2
34515,Was very disappointed.,34515,2
34516,I was really disappointed in how this fit.,34516,2
34516,It was more like a large than a 2x.,34516,2
34516,If I wasn't trying to lose weight I would return it and request a refund,34516,2
34517,Not really what I expected.,34517,2
34517,The picture is faded and the elastic in the waist is only on one side.,34517,2
34517,Not all around like it should be.,34517,2
34517,You get what you pay for I guess...,34517,2
34518,I really liked  it but the fabric was not good quality.,34518,2
34518,I was missing a button.,34518,2
34519,"Fit terribly, hard to mould.",34519,2
34520,Like,34520,2
34521,"Website incorrectly lists fabric as 95% cotton, 5% spandex.",34521,2
34521,"The actual fabric content is 95% polyester and 5% spandex, so it's a very slick shirt.",34521,2
34521,Returning this item.,34521,2
34522,Looks cheap,34522,2
34523,I did not get this necklace.,34523,2
34523,The necklace I got solid blue in the middle that didn't glow.,34523,2
34524,Fits around waist but not around the rest of the midsection.,34524,2
34524,Used measurements and recommendations of seller.,34524,2
34525,"These are cute, but they aren't very practical- the tip of the scissors is very wide so getting it beneath a bandage is very difficult- and if it does fit the scissors are not very sharp.",34525,2
34525,Also the screw that holds them together was loose when I took these out of the package and it is made sonthat you can't tighten it.,34525,2
34525,I was really disappointed in these- I figured if the Koi scrubs were so great their bandage scissors would also be grewt- but unfortunately I was totally wrong.,34525,2
34526,I really like the material!,34526,2
34526,However I was expecting it to be a little tighter.,34526,2
34526,Maybe this is because I am used to wearing Spanx every now and then.,34526,2
34526,"Anyway, I was super disappointed in the butt lift.",34526,2
34526,I barely see any difference in wearing it and not wearing it.,34526,2
34526,I wore it yesterday in a pair of shorts and felt a bit more confident but when I wore a dress my butt was barely any higher.,34526,2
34526,I'm soo jealous of the women that got awesome results!,34526,2
34526,I am 145lbs so of of course I got the M/L but maybe that was too big for me??,34526,2
34526,"Other than that it's great material and super comfortable, you can hardly feel it.",34526,2
34527,Bad quality!!!!,34527,2
34527,Poor fabric!!!,34527,2
34527,Cheap material!!!,34527,2
34527,Just awful!,34527,2
34527,!,34527,2
34528,If your breasts are anything larger than a B it won't fit.,34528,2
34529,Product discription said one size fits all!,34529,2
34529,"They are way to small for me, I think they will fit a little guy best.",34529,2
34530,Poor fit the large is more like a 4/5 and is super tight.,34530,2
34530,It does not contain the side boob and is not meant for busty women.,34530,2
34530,"The bottoms are cute but the sash part was not in the front like the picture shows, but in the back.",34530,2
34531,The shirt fit fine everywhere but my chest.,34531,2
34531,It was very tight so my daughter is now wearing it as a cover-up.,34531,2
34532,"mauvaise qualit&eacute; du tissu et des finitions, et la robe est plus courte que ce qu'on montre sur la photo.",34532,2
34532,le tissu est vraiment L&eacute;g&eacute; et mme transparent !,34532,2
34532,je regrette vraiment cet achat.,34532,2
34533,Unfortunately they barely fit me - I ordered 9(L) but they fit like S. Running small.,34533,2
34534,Got a hole in armpit seam after first wash,34534,2
34535,Returned because quality wasn't there.,34535,2
34535,Awful smell.,34535,2
34535,"This would be best for a toddler, not a school aged child.",34535,2
34536,"Very pretty, but it is as if i was wearing a gause.",34536,2
34536,A see thru dress,34536,2
34537,Only recomend if you have a small torso and are slightly wide at the same time.,34537,2
34537,I'm 5'8 and theory no way I could have fit the shoulders and legs at the same time without folding in half I had a friend try it as well she's only 5'6 had the same issue.,34537,2
34537,So sad because it's so cute!,34537,2
34538,"Be careful, and take your body shape into account before purchasing.",34538,2
34538,"You can either have your junk in the pouch, or your ass crack covered, but not both.",34538,2
34538,"Some might be able to pull it off, but I would imagine they would be in the minority.",34538,2
34538,The maker really needs to sew the pouch WAY higher up.,34538,2
34539,"This blouse has no shape to it, the blouse I received was not white, but a cream color.",34539,2
34539,I received it over 6 weeks now and still have not worn it as yet.,34539,2
34539,I am just not enthused because of how it looks.,34539,2
34540,Way to large!,34540,2
34541,NOT for a three year old.,34541,2
34541,"my son is pretty average size- and these glasses, however CUTE they were, were WAY too big for him!!",34541,2
34541,Had to return.,34541,2
34542,I ordered the largest size I could and I am not a large woman.,34542,2
34542,This X-large shirt would never fit a normal US woman that had any curves.,34542,2
34542,"I got the shirt on, but would never wear it as tight and fitted as it fits.",34542,2
34542,"I am saddened by this since it is a very cute shirt, but there was no way I could wear the shirt.",34542,2
34542,In my opinion the XL fits like a US XS or at most Small.,34542,2
34542,I don't know any XS people to even give this shirt to so I'm afraid it is going to become a goodwill donation at this point.,34542,2
34542,I would not recommend this shirt to others because of the large difference in sizing.,34542,2
34543,Way too long for an average height lady.,34543,2
34543,I ended up ordering the petite Navy colored dress and love it!,34543,2
34543,Just wish they had the petite in black..,34543,2
34544,I ended up giving it to one of the kids I work with because this is not an ADULT size,34544,2
34545,The front of it is cloth which makes it very hard to clean.,34545,2
34545,I was expecting it to be a slick material like the sleeves.,34545,2
34546,Fits more like pjs than a dress,34546,2
34547,Very small hips.,34547,2
34547,Structured design with boning.,34547,2
34547,Not comfortable.,34547,2
34547,Return process was not efficient.,34547,2
34548,"Its,to tight cant even zip it up...and the bust area doesn't fit right...",34548,2
34548,I have to return it..,34548,2
34549,"It is not a bad material but is a very small, I guess is a Chinese product so therefore it runs extremely small!!",34549,2
34549,I were a 12 I  probably had to get XXL instead of a L!!,34549,2
34549,!,34549,2
34550,"I like the size because their small and sit perfect however I really want them because they were glow in the dark however they don't glow in the dark at all which was very disappointing, but as usual Amazon is great on shipping so it was my first bittersweet experience,",34550,2
34551,sent back,34551,2
34552,Very short in the waist.,34552,2
34552,I use it under other shirts only.,34552,2
34553,"I really liked the tights and the way they fit, but there was a tear in them when they arrived so I had to return them.",34553,2
34554,"It actually fits as expected, except where the sleeves were attached.",34554,2
34554,The sleeves don't appear to belong to the same pattern pieces because it's tight and bulky causing a bad fit.,34554,2
34554,"Where the shoulder meets the sleeve, it bulges, and the front and back of the sleeves are sewn too deeply into the back and chest, causing it to be too tight.",34554,2
34554,"One sleeve was constricting, while the other was gaping, at the wrists.",34554,2
34554,I made the necessary alterations by removing the elastic and stitching up the seam.,34554,2
34554,"It looks much better without, anyway.",34554,2
34554,It's a very pretty nightgown....too bad the seamstress made a mess of it.,34554,2
34555,I am 5'4 and went from 130 to 199 after 9 months bed rest.,34555,2
34555,I bought this compression tank -along few others- and while trying to wear it (two weeks postpartum at 180) the seams came apart.,34555,2
34555,"Perhaps I was the lucky one who got the bad item...but just in case, avoid it.",34555,2
34556,Has a very strong odor,34556,2
34557,Advertisement said the item was men's gloves.,34557,2
34557,However the gloves were so small it did not fit my wife.,34557,2
34557,Packaging did not reflect a size.,34557,2
34558,The sizing was soooo off.,34558,2
34558,I purchased the xl and it was more like a medium.,34558,2
34558,I like the way it looks so I am giving it to someone else.,34558,2
34559,"Bag comes as it appears, I'm satisfied with the bag but upon opening it there was a foul fishy smell inside of the purse, I have tried to spray perfume and febreeze to mask it and the smell is still there, for that I rate two stars.",34559,2
34560,I'm a size 10 or M and these are WAY too small... Can't see them fitting anyone over size 2.,34560,2
34560,"Only one side ties and the other side is only 2 inches of elastic between the front and back fabric panels, way less than pictured.",34560,2
34561,The Large was more like a medium.....in cotton....after being washed and dried on HOT settings.....,34561,2
34562,"Be warned if you're tall (I'm 5'9"") that these might not work for you.",34562,2
34562,"The crotch is really short so I had to choose between high waters and whale tail (um neither, thanks haha).",34562,2
34562,"The ""fold over"" part is supposedly adjustable but doesn't look good in my opinion when flipped up instead of folded down.",34562,2
34562,That was my attempt to give myself some more length.,34562,2
34563,The shorts were way too baggy for the panties.,34563,2
34563,"The inside panties fit fine, but there was just too much fabric all around for the shorts the crotch hung much too low.",34563,2
34564,This dress does not look anything like the photo.,34564,2
34564,Very cheaply made with stiff fabric.,34564,2
34564,I would not recommend this.,34564,2
34565,the zipper broke after my first use.,34565,2
34565,"i try to fit as much as i can into the bag, but the zipper wasn't strong enough for a very slight stretch.",34565,2
34565,do not recommend.,34565,2
34566,"it is fair, it could be alot better.",34566,2
34566,The pendant broke on me the first day.,34566,2
34566,Sorry,34566,2
34567,Not nice ',34567,2
34568,"The quality of the belt fabric is very good, but I had to return this belt because it was way too long and the buckle too big.",34568,2
34568,"I ordered a Large described as 39"", but the one I received measured 44"" (not including the buckle).",34568,2
34568,"Also, the buckle is too large for the width of the belt (the picture in the description doesn't show this very well).",34568,2
34568,The belt would be perfect if it were the described length and if the buckle was smaller.,34568,2
34568,I didn't re-order a smaller length because the huge buckle was a deal breaker.,34568,2
34569,These are super cute and super small or I apparently have a 5month old with gigantic legs - which I do not.,34569,2
34570,Too small,34570,2
34571,It's a cute suit but it's not what it shows in the picture.,34571,2
34571,The bottoms are tight but the top fits as expected.,34571,2
34571,"Also, the top is not a dark purple like it shows in the photo; it's more of a wine/burgundy color.",34571,2
34572,This is a very nice coat but make sure you look at the size charts.,34572,2
34572,I ordered it for a bigger lady thinking xxl would fit but it fit my 8 year old grandchild.,34572,2
34573,Really cute if you're a stick figure.,34573,2
34573,"I'm 5'1 and 130 pounds, and a medium didn't fit at all.",34573,2
34573,I have a larger chest and buttock area and the dress wouldn't zip up.,34573,2
34573,It fit my sister who is 5'6 and 100 pounds instead.,34573,2
34573,It looked cute on her.,34573,2
34574,The case itself is okay...but it's not actually sparkly.,34574,2
34574,"I couldn't tell that when I purchased it, even looking at the pictures.",34574,2
34575,"Nice shirt, clever and all, but it def.",34575,2
34575,runs small.,34575,2
34576,For small chest person,34576,2
34577,"Runs small, order a size up",34577,2
34578,It wasn't clean it was also itchy,34578,2
34579,"To small, poor quality and cheap fabrics",34579,2
34580,very cute but very small and flimsy material,34580,2
34581,Poor quality!,34581,2
34582,"This often shrinks when washed, we didn't dry it and then it was stiff.",34582,2
34582,It sucks because I LOVED thin tank too.,34582,2
34582,If i ever got a new one I'd never wash it because it shrinks to the size a newborn could wear.,34582,2
34582,It would be a 5/5 if it didn't shrink!,34582,2
34583,This sleeping cap is way to small...picture is very misleading.,34583,2
34583,Had I known I would've never ordered it.,34583,2
34583,Not made for thick long hair at all.,34583,2
34583,Material is nice.,34583,2
34584,Not a lot of support for your breasts.,34584,2
34585,This is NOT a maternity dress.,34585,2
34585,Does have some stretch and looks adorable on.,34585,2
34585,But not very comfortable and no elastic on the sides,34585,2
34586,"The black tank is not long, by any means, and I'm short!",34586,2
34586,It stops right at the top of my pants.,34586,2
34587,I wear size 11.5.,34587,2
34587,I purchased 8-12 size.,34587,2
34587,They are almost too big for me to wear.,34587,2
34587,There is little to zero compression.,34587,2
34587,They are wool combination sock so they will keep your feet warmer than cotton.,34587,2
34588,"I wear a lot bandannas in the summer working outside or riding my bike, it helps keep the sweat from getting in my eyes, that's why I bought it.",34588,2
34588,I also bought it.,34588,2
34588,"I gave it 2 stars because it looks cool if it's folded over, but it's very thin and I can even see through it.",34588,2
34588,"I plan to keep it as it didn't cost that much, but I'm disappointed in regards to the thin material and low quality.",34588,2
34588,A lot of my other bandannas are thicker and much better quality.,34588,2
34588,Just FYI for everyone.,34588,2
34589,Hard to get the right size,34589,2
34590,The sleeves and body are not as long as the photo.,34590,2
34590,The fit was a bit smaller as well.,34590,2
34591,"The item title says ""Italy Made,"" which insinuates that the product is made in Italy.",34591,2
34591,It is not.,34591,2
34591,It is made in China.,34591,2
34591,"I guess what's ""Italy Made"" is the leather, not the wallet itself.",34591,2
34591,"This is not just misleading, it's outright deceptive.",34591,2
34591,It irks me when we are not given the correct information to make purchasing decisions.,34591,2
34591,"All of that aside, I don't like the design of the wallet.",34591,2
34591,"American bills barely fit in the bill pocket, while the credit card slots are too loose.",34591,2
34591,"Also, the credit card pockets are not stitched to the edge, which means that a bulky point forms in the middle of the wallet where all the cards pile together when the wallet is folded.",34591,2
34591,"I guess this is how they make the wallet ""slim,"" by getting that bulk farther away from where it folds, but I don't see the leather wearing nicely given this construction.",34591,2
34592,Weren't what I expected.,34592,2
34592,Shiny spandex material.,34592,2
34592,Didn't really like.,34592,2
34592,Ran small.,34592,2
34593,Lackluster when not in light.,34593,2
34593,Not what I wanted.,34593,2
34593,I will be returning.,34593,2
34594,"Had to return it, it didn't fit the majority of my cards.",34594,2
34594,Liked the slim and sleek outside style though.,34594,2
34595,"extremely small and unflattering....even for someone who is 5'2"" and 110lbs.",34595,2
34595,Poor quality as well.,34595,2
34596,I read the reviews before purchasing.,34596,2
34596,I used the ring for a halloween costume.,34596,2
34596,"Perhaps I was too rough while wearing the ring, but the stone fell out and is missing.",34596,2
34596,It almost lasted 12 hours.,34596,2
34596,The sizing was accurate.,34596,2
34597,"Ordered extra large, got medium size",34597,2
34598,"Very short, too small, sleeves and cuffs even tight on daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than myself.",34598,2
34599,"I ordered a bigger size than I usually wear because I'm pregnant, and the dress still doesn't fit as long as the picture shows.",34599,2
34599,"It fits about half way between my knees and feet, making it not a maxi dress.",34599,2
34600,Purchased the two-pack.,34600,2
34600,"Upon my first use of one of the packs earlier this week, the zipper broke.",34600,2
34600,"Tomorrow, I fly out again, so I'll be using the second bag.",34600,2
34600,"Hopefully, it'll hold up.",34600,2
34600,"I registered my warranty online at the C+F website, and contacted the company about receiving a replacement.",34600,2
34600,I'll update my review if/when that happens.,34600,2
34600,"Sure, it's just an under-$20 product, but still, it shouldn't break on your first use.",34600,2
34601,"This shirt is not baggy at all, it was form fitting and the sleeves needed to be a few inches longer.",34601,2
34601,The shirt saaid large but definitely did not fit that way.,34601,2
34601,Probably better for someone with a very small frame and not an athletic one.,34601,2
34602,Not ideal or what I am trying to get.,34602,2
34602,These pasties were mixed.,34602,2
34602,"Some of them are the nylon ones I wanted, others are papery and painful to remove.",34602,2
34603,Looks like it would be nice if it would fit.,34603,2
34603,We ordered a bigger size than we thought we would need and it was still waaaay too small.,34603,2
34603,"We ordered an extra large and it would be lucky to fit a 10 year old child in the USA,  We will be giving away to someone else.",34603,2
34603,Make sure you order a gigantic size if you want it to fit.,34603,2
34604,This are too snug and it is almost impossible to get them zipped up.,34604,2
34604,They might be fine for the smaller chested.,34604,2
34605,"Terrible quality printing, terrible feeling material.",34605,2
34605,Ran way small.,34605,2
34605,Totally disagree with other positive reviews.,34605,2
34606,The product arrived but it was too small,34606,2
34607,much smaller than I expected for ordering Large.,34607,2
34607,"very low rise, for me.",34607,2
34607,"they fit like Juniors, not ladies.",34607,2
34608,"Fit close to as described however these leggingns were like tights when I put them on, so I returned them.",34608,2
34608,I could see through these from the knee up.,34608,2
34609,Was too large.,34609,2
34609,I had to return it.,34609,2
34610,I have wore dresses like this for years.,34610,2
34610,Most recent order was returned because after dress was washed it shrunk.,34610,2

34610,Had to return.,34610,2
34611,Did not like the material.,34611,2
34612,"This dress is cute, nice fabric but sewn terribly.",34612,2
34612,"They only put the top fringe across the front, it ends at the shoulders.",34612,2
34612,"The lining across the back is too small and is sewn incorrectly, there's no top stitching to hold it in place and it flips out and hangs outside the dress.",34612,2
34612,"The sleeves are too tight under the arms and the cuffs are sews tightly, almost giving the dress puffed sleeves.",34612,2
34613,well to be honnest buy a thong not these because the pouch is way to small,34613,2
34614,Too large.,34614,2
34614,Sent back.,34614,2
34615,"It runs small, the material is cheap.",34615,2
34615,I thought it would look more like a sweater.,34615,2
34615,It's just a thin cotton.,34615,2
34615,I returned this,34615,2
34616,So- so.,34616,2
34616,Clearly plastic even from a distance.,34616,2
34616,"Still for the price it holds my ebook and phone, glasses, etc., and the plastic makes it right for a crappy weather day.",34616,2
34617,"These are beautiful, but after only 2 or 3 times of wearing them, the beautiful rose gold finish has worn off.",34617,2
34617,"They would be perfect for bridesmaids, but if you're looking for regular wear, go elsewhere.",34617,2
34618,The Tshirt was really nice.,34618,2
34618,"Although the shirt fit , sad to say it was too tight in the arms so it had to be returned.",34618,2

34619,Refund issued promptly.,34619,2
34620,The size chart for this item is way off.,34620,2

34622,Sent back.,34622,2
34622,Looked cheap.,34622,2
34623,The dress would be nice but it has these cheap foam breast cups that are too small and move all over the place which ruins it.,34623,2
34624,5'8 125 lbs.,34624,2
34624,Bought a M/L and crotch hit me mid thigh.,34624,2
34624,The stitching had the weirdest fit and the legs were way too short.,34624,2

34627,"I really wanted to like this, but it was shapeless and unflattering.",34627,2
34627,Sent it back.,34627,2

34639,I WISH I HAD IT IN REAL GOLD !,34639,2
34640,"This isn't a Sullen t shirt, but a cheap China knock off!",34640,2
34640,It was printed on a nylon shirt similiar to a baseball shirt!,34640,2
34640,CHEAP and FAKE.,34640,2

34640,DO NOT BUY!!,34640,2
34640,!,34640,2
34641,Not flattering,34641,2
34642,"When I bought this kilt 2 years ago, I liked it.",34642,2
34642,At the same time I also bought a $205.00 kilt from Utilikilts.,34642,2
34642,"Obviously I didn't expect the same quality and attention to detail, but I thought the UT kilt was dollar for dollar a better value.",34642,2
34642,"I don't love the positioning of the pockets on this one, they are kind of half-way between on the side, and behind, like it was a compromise between the two.",34642,2
34642,"That said, I've had them both for 2 years, I have worn each maybe 10 or 12 times total, albeit mostly out in the desert for Burning Man, which is pretty harsh, but I started to wear it around town on hot days here in L.A. CA recently.",34642,2
34642,"Basically the two of them have been folded in a drawer for nine or ten months, and I just pulled them out.",34642,2
34642,The Utilikilt looks near new.,34642,2
34642,"The UT Kilt has multiple seams coming apart, one pocket is completely open on one side, and several of the pleats and seams are just not sewed shut any more.",34642,2
34642,"Worse, the fabric is faded!",34642,2
34642,"Like, really blotchy faded!",34642,2
34642,"Not from over washing, because where it's pleated or the material overlaps when you wear it, it isn't faded.",34642,2
34642,"I think the dye they used just fades in the sun, and unevenly at that.",34642,2
34642,"There has to be a happy medium between ""Falls apart in occasional moderate use"" and ""Expensive as all get-out"", so I'm trying some of the other brands on Amazon.",34642,2
34642,"The Damn Near Kilt 'Em I just bought has a really nice feel to the material, and lots of pockets!",34642,2
34642,"It's too big, so I'm returning it for the next smaller size, and I wish they sold it by the inch instead of Small, Medium, Large etc., but I have high hopes.",34642,2
34643,The reviews said it ran small so with me having a large bust I bought it bigger well it was too big.,34643,2
34643,The shirt looked silver in the pic but it's like a cream color lace on the white shirt.,34643,2
34643,It's OK not my favorite.,34643,2
34644,Material is not nice,34644,2
34645,Fit is small.,34645,2
34645,I sized up and got the fit I would've expected from smaller size (is 2Xl fits like xl).,34645,2
34645,"It isn't coat weight, but jacket.",34645,2
34645,Patches are very nice.,34645,2
34645,Ties down sleeves and sides are not leather.,34645,2
34645,"Quality is just OK, left outside pocket tore at the seam first time I wore it.",34645,2
34645,(Only put my hands in it once).,34645,2
34646,"this turned out to be more like a crop top - too short for me, and I'm only 5"" 6""",34646,2
34647,Was not quite what I expected.,34647,2
34648,Two stars because I like the style of it.,34648,2
34648,But the top is small in some places and big in others.,34648,2
34648,Luckily my mom can do alterations and make it decent.,34648,2
34648,You get what you pay for.,34648,2
34649,The shirt I expected was an oversized off the shoulder adorable shirt.,34649,2
34649,After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes big and it's still very snug the kneck hole is like a t-shirt not wide at all and it's 3/4 sleeve.,34649,2
34649,I will say the material is soft and comfortable and it is wearable.,34649,2
34649,BUT it isn't what I wanted.,34649,2
34650,made to small,34650,2
34651,Very clingy material.,34651,2
34651,I hated it and will never wear it but I also feel a little chubby.,34651,2
34651,I'm 5 foot one 130 pounds.,34651,2
34652,This dress looks gorgeous on me!,34652,2
34652,I cant wait to wear it.,34652,2
34652,Pleased about the quality of the fabric.,34652,2
34652,Luckily I lost weight prior to receiving my package and I am pleasantly surprised on how well it fits.,34652,2
34652,"However, the blue is not as vivid as the image but gorgeous just the same.",34652,2
34652,Update: I am updating my review on this product.,34652,2
34652,The stitching is poor and the top began separating when I tried it on the second time.,34652,2
34652,So sad that Meilum fashions did not address my concerns.,34652,2
34652,"The initial response was quick but once I sent the images of the defect ""Tina"" in customer service stopped responding to my e-mails!",34652,2
34652,So disappointed!,34652,2
34653,Quite unhappy that the zipper broke when I used it the second time.,34653,2
34653,Other than it was great.,34653,2
34653,Nice and easy to put on but now I can't even use it.,34653,2

34654,"I thought the front would just hide imperfections, which it did it just make me look like I was one shape.",34654,2
34655,the top of the dress was to small,34655,2
34656,These sweatpants are huge and bulky.,34656,2
34656,Order at least one size down.,34656,2
34657,PU Leather is right.,34657,2
34657,"It's #1, plastic, and #2, not leather and #3, it stinks.",34657,2
34657,"I know, I know...you get what you pay for...I wasn't expecting high end but this is terrible.",34657,2
34657,"By the way the color blue is ""cobalt"".",34657,2
34657,I bought it for a trip I'm taking next week to put my laptop in and other travel documents.,34657,2
34657,It's perfect for that.,34657,2
34657,Has tons of zipper compartments and a cross body strap.,34657,2
34657,I'm going to try to find something else quick and send this back or if I can't find anything else I'll take this one,34657,2
34658,I've had this black hoop with the opal bead in my lip for about a month now.,34658,2
34658,"About a week ago, the black started to chip off of the hoop.",34658,2
34658,"Im very dissapointed because I really like ther opal lip rings, I have this sellers silver opal bead ring as well.",34658,2

34663,I did not notice that until recently and now I am not able to return it.,34663,2
34664,I normally wear a Large but I wanted this to fit like shown in the picture so I played it safe and ordered an XL.,34664,2
34664,"It's too tight, not lose at all.",34664,2
34664,the sleeves are also way too short.,34664,2
34664,It doesn't look like what is pictured.,34664,2
34664,The embroidery is pretty but it's blue.,34664,2
34664,Not at all what I was expecting.,34664,2
34665,I chose this top because of the shelf bra.,34665,2
34665,"Unfortunately, the arm holes are cut so low, I have to wear a bra with it.",34665,2
34665,This is the opposite of what I wanted.,34665,2
34666,The bottom fits great however the top seems really short.,34666,2
34666,also the bottoms are far apart.,34666,2
34666,The material is also different than it appears.,34666,2
34667,I won't be able to wear this.,34667,2
34667,I ordered in the measurements recommended and it was pretty far off.,34667,2
34668,"Cheaply made, fits oddly as well.",34668,2
34668,You'll have to continuously be adjusting unless you have a perfect fit in the shoulders.,34668,2
34668,I didn't even wear mine after I received it.,34668,2
34668,Straight donated it.,34668,2
34669,This was really cute for a while but then the silver wore off on the back of the ears and turned gold and started giving me a rash.,34669,2
34669,It was super painful.,34669,2
34670,This swimsuit is beautiful but I came with the pantie Broken In A Corner,34670,2
34671,Firstly the bag came in small box which caused it to become very wrinkled.,34671,2
34671,The bag was smaller than I wanted it to be but overall it had a very nice design.,34671,2
34671,However I sent and back about 3 weeks ago and have yet to receive my $31.00 back.,34671,2
34671,What a waste of money.,34671,2
34672,"material is see-through, but you can't really wear a cami underneath this shirt",34672,2
34673,The top didn't have enough support for worth with large breast,34673,2
34674,Very weird fit.,34674,2
34674,The shirt was extremely wide and very short.,34674,2
34674,Does not fit at all the way pajamas in the same size from the same company fit.,34674,2
34674,We had to return it.,34674,2
34675,i'm returning this.,34675,2
34675,i'm short (5' tall) and this is just too much fabric on such a short frame.,34675,2
34675,i ordered a small and a medium.,34675,2
34675,"the small is better but the  arms are quite tight, and still too much fabric around the torso/hips for me to be able to pull it off.",34675,2
34675,i could see this looking nice on someone considerably taller.,34675,2
34675,sweater was soft and the colors were nice.,34675,2
34675,quality seemed good too.,34675,2
34676,Poor fit.,34676,2
34676,I usually wear a M. But since seeing a few reviews saying they run small I grabbed a large.,34676,2
34676,"They're about 4 inches, if not more, too short.",34676,2
34676,The waist is pretty tight considering it's a size larger than normal for me.,34676,2
34676,The pattern doesn't look the same as the photo.,34676,2
34676,Also the pants are not at all flowy and baggy.,34676,2
34676,They're tight and too short.,34676,2
34676,Almost straight let or closer to like a baggy pair of leggings.,34676,2
34676,Terrible quality sewing.,34676,2
34676,"Also, there's no tag so you don't know what side is the front or back until you put them on.",34676,2
34676,They either fit somewhat normal or feel really roomy in the front.,34676,2
34677,"This was supposed to fit a 5 foot tall, 90 lbs.",34677,2
34677,girl.,34677,2
34677,It was too small to the point of it being snug all around.,34677,2
34677,Returned it.,34677,2
34678,"Must have read the description wrong, tail looked like child size",34678,2
34679,Used gloves for the first time & they ripped.,34679,2
34679,Need to return them,34679,2
34680,Just did not like the look of these glasses on me.,34680,2
34681,The part to adjust wristbsize already came apart.,34681,2
34681,Went to order a second one and unfortunately they no longer have them to try a second one.,34681,2
34682,"By the third time my daughter wore this, the original color was no longer evident.",34682,2
34682,My pool filter kept turning purple because of all the color being bleached out.,34682,2
34682,"It is marketed as swimwear, but it is NOT!",34682,2
34683,The dress is very pretty but the bottom is strange.,34683,2
34683,One side is straight and the other side curved.,34683,2
34683,It looks weird like it's not intended to be like that.,34683,2
34683,I'm returning,34683,2
34684,"A cute gift for young girls to share with their BFF, but my daughters half has begun to turn brown, looks rusted!",34684,2
34684,"She still loves it, but I wish it had lasted longer.",34684,2
34685,sizes are 2 sizes smaller than stated,34685,2
34686,I want large but they mail small to me,34686,2
34687,"The picture clearly shows that the fez and bowtie match, but what was received did not.",34687,2
34687,"Hat was bright red, tie was dark red.",34687,2
34687,If I didn't need it sooner I'd send it back.,34687,2
34688,"Fabric too thin, could be worn as lingerie",34688,2
34689,The fit was completely inappropriate on this one.,34689,2
34689,"It was baggy in the middle, the chest area was loose and there was no room for adjustments.",34689,2
34689,I had to return it.,34689,2
34689,"The return process happened through PDS, not Amazon.",34689,2
34689,"It was simple enough, but I am not yet sure if my refund has fully been processed.",34689,2
34689,I gotta go dive into my credit card statements.,34689,2
34690,Quality is okay.,34690,2
34690,"But I ordered custom made and they had all my measurements, which they lost.",34690,2
34690,And then when I finally did they the dress it is at least 3 sizes to big.,34690,2
34691,Fits as expected for one size fits most.,34691,2
34691,The reason for the 2 stars is because they came to me with two runs in them.,34691,2
34691,They seemed to snag easily.,34691,2
34691,Not very strong legging.,34691,2
34691,Would not buy again.,34691,2
34691,Returned item.,34691,2
34692,Very narrow fit,34692,2
34693,Beautiful shirt but ran very small.,34693,2
34694,The material is perfect but small is like a large.,34694,2
34694,I can not use.,34694,2
34695,These went through the wash once and started to unravel.,34695,2
34695,Would not buy again,34695,2
34696,Size didn't fit me at all.,34696,2
34696,"I ordered the size I normally wear, but it is just to tight.",34696,2
34697,Very cheap looking.,34697,2
34697,Fits kind of strange.,34697,2
34698,"Cute, but way to small and super see-through",34698,2
34699,The material is a bit too thin and the length isn't ideal.,34699,2
34699,It is also very low cut.,34699,2
34699,"I felt a little ""disco"" when I tried it on!",34699,2
34699,lol,34699,2
34700,Cute purse no pockets just a purse...the chain is extremely short...or I'm really tall,34700,2
34701,Nice color but very boxy.,34701,2
34701,Does not hang off the shoulder.,34701,2
34702,i didn't use this purse till just now!,34702,2
34702,"After two trips to the store the studs are falling off, very disappointed.",34702,2
34702,Otherwise it's good size soft and lots of cargo space!,34702,2
34702,Plus I am embarrassed to use it as purse now!,34702,2
34703,Cute but way way  way too big.,34703,2
34703,Would not stay on my face,34703,2
34704,"I ordered this shirt for myself as a Christmas present and since I wear a US size 12-14, I ordered an XL.",34704,2
34704,"It is far too small for me, I gave it to my 14 year old daughter who wears a size 8 and it fits her.",34704,2
34705,"My grandaughter loved this , but way to thin to be a swim suit.",34705,2
34705,Cute for PJ's,34705,2
34706,To small,34706,2
34707,Great fabric.,34707,2
34707,"If your package is on the large size, this is for you.",34707,2
34707,But if it's medium or small it's way to large.,34707,2
34708,"This is so, so big.",34708,2
34708,It looks more like a shapeless mumu than a dainty lace cover-up.,34708,2
34708,"I'm 5'4"" and it comes well below my knees, and the neckline is wider than my hips.",34708,2
34708,It barely stays on!,34708,2
34708,"I'm too lazy to return it, so I've thought of some creative ways to tie it up in order to give it some shape.",34708,2
34709,AWFUL!!,34709,2
34709,"This hat is not ""greenish"".",34709,2
34709,It is lime green and UGLY.,34709,2
34709,It is not worth the money.,34709,2
34709,It would be overpriced even if the price was $1.00.,34709,2
34709,The picture is most deceiving.,34709,2
34710,Very thin material.,34710,2
34710,Top wraps on and can't imagine That if you are actually going to swim in this that it would stay on.,34710,2
34711,"I like the glasses, they are cute but the arrived with a huge scratch on them.",34711,2
34711,The white thing in the middle of the lens is a deep scratch,34711,2
34712,Too short.,34712,2
34712,Very unhappy.,34712,2
34712,I'm 5'4 and its like a mini dress on me.,34712,2
34713,"very cheaply made, zipper splits after it's zipped up.",34713,2
34714,"I knew it wasn't going to be much from the reviews, but it left black fuzz on everything and turned my fingers gray just from straightening the fringe out during the evening.",34714,2
34715,I was planning on dying these for a costume I was making.,34715,2
34715,"I have a lot of experience dying fabric, but no matter what I did to these it wouldn't take.",34715,2
34715,"That may not be fault of the producers, but it didn't fit my personal needs.",34715,2
34716,Color almost exactly as pictured didn't think they would be that ugly,34716,2
34717,I ordered 3 packages.,34717,2
34717,"When they came, they were all pink.",34717,2
34717,None of the blue/green/pink as pictured.,34717,2
34717,I kept one and returned the others stating they were not as shown.,34717,2
34717,"I reordered 2 packages and when they came, they were all pink also.",34717,2
34717,I just gave them to my daughter.,34717,2
34717,Is there anyway to get the blue packages as shown?,34717,2
34718,Sizes definitely run small,34718,2
34719,This product wasn't way good because one the size is small so order a size up or 2 and second my package kept falling out of the pouch because the pouch is so small.,34719,2
34719,Definitely would only wear this around the house not while outgoing.,34719,2
34720,I purchased my regular size and I was swimming in it.,34720,2
34720,It was really long.,34720,2
34720,"I realize that a cover-up is supposed to fit big, but this was ridiculous and I returned it.",34720,2
34721,Not happy at all.,34721,2
34721,Looks nothing like the picture...,34721,2
34722,VERY awkward fit!,34722,2
34722,"Fit was pretty much as expected, but because of the cut and weird seaming, It did not sit well.",34722,2
34722,I really wanted it to work!,34722,2
34722,but it's a no go.,34722,2
34723,It fits really small but I can't return it...,34723,2
34724,soso not like pic but decent for $ big in waist and too tight in the shoulder area but arm sleeves looked great top was stunning just ba little awkward in the waist,34724,2
34725,"Super cute, but super small",34725,2
34726,These were advertised as fitting size 8-12 mens.,34726,2
34726,"They will not fit a mens 10, they are so big they seem to only fit a size bigger than a 12.",34726,2
34726,Completely useless to me at a size 8-81/2.,34726,2
34727,Cute shoe but hard on feet.,34727,2
34727,Thought about buying a gel insole but returned instead.,34727,2
34728,had to return them as they were much smaller that the other 41 FiveFinger pair i have.,34728,2
34729,Runs small.,34729,2
34729,Order a size or two up.,34729,2
34729,Could also use a tank top underneath.,34729,2
34730,"If you are a US size 4, this is way too big.",34730,2
34731,"The size says large, but its too small",34731,2
34732,"A lot of the reviews are about how ""cheap"" this necklace is.",34732,2
34732,"Well, it is cheap.",34732,2
34732,I knew that when I hardly paid anything for it.,34732,2
34732,"Honestly it's cute, obviously it's not high quality.",34732,2
34732,My biggest disappointment was that the triangle doesn't hang the way it does in the photo.,34732,2
34732,It's supposed to hang and look like an arrow.,34732,2
34732,"But it's upside down, and is just a random triangle at the bottom of a chain.",34732,2
34733,Way too small for busty women,34733,2
34734,"The inside material feels like plastic, very cheaply made.",34734,2
34735,Cheaply made,34735,2
34736,Poor quality and weird fit.,34736,2
34736,The zipper was impossible to zip up.,34736,2
34737,"Fit as expected at first, but after a few wash it tend to fall off.",34737,2
34737,Worn out to fast.,34737,2
34738,"Way too big, even though I ordered a size smaller than what it said.",34738,2
34738,"I am 5'8, 135 lbs and it was super long.",34738,2
34738,When I sat down it would dig into my thighs and ride up onto my bra.,34738,2
34738,Send it back.,34738,2
34739,The shirt runs small and the superman logo is small for the shirt.,34739,2
34739,Such a bummer for my superman fan.,34739,2
34740,"Very cute, but the bottoms were way too small that my fat was popping out and the top was hurting my neck.",34740,2
34741,"Small and disappointing, not everything has been delivered.",34741,2
34742,Cheaply made.,34742,2
34742,Finger loops barely made it through the night.,34742,2
34743,My grandkids wanted these pens and they were a complete waste of money and a big disappointment for them.,34743,2
34743,There was nothing about them that was shocking.,34743,2
34743,I thought that because they would bend that it would maybe give them a little pinch but nothing what so ever.,34743,2
34743,"Also, when they arrived they all fell out of the container that they came in because it was all beaten up and smashed.",34743,2
34743,Bottom line.....don't waste your money because they are not cheap.,34743,2
34744,Too small eventhough my order was XL.,34744,2
34744,I had to give it away.,34744,2
34744,Poor purchase.,34744,2
34745,Eh...,34745,2
34745,It's not comfortable to wear unless you're staying at home.,34745,2
34745,It's thick and bulky.,34745,2
34745,It also folds and rolls.,34745,2
34745,Used it only 2 weeks postpartum,34745,2
34746,Does not stay clasped.,34746,2
34746,The end of the bracelet flops around after you claps it shut.,34746,2
34746,Not a great accessory.,34746,2
34746,Looks pretty if you don't move.,34746,2
34747,"Watch out for the wedgies, had to send them back.",34747,2
34747,Large isn't a 40-42 waist at all by far  More like medium.,34747,2
34747,Way too small.,34747,2
34748,Pretty color!,34748,2
34748,But way too small--I have broad shoulders and a 32D bust.,34748,2
34748,"Also, the short stacked hemline is super unflattering.",34748,2
34748,Made me look like a wide box.,34748,2
34748,"Might be better for someone with a shorter torso, or with no hips.",34748,2
34748,It doesn't flatter your waistline at all.,34748,2
34749,"The good: The print on the wallet was exactly as pictured, clear and vibrant.",34749,2
34749,"The bad: The pockets that credit cards slip into are tiered, but the bottoms aren't.",34749,2
34749,"So when you put your cards into any other pocket than the first one, you can't see your credit card or reach it easily.",34749,2
34749,Which ia not easy to do in an oversized wallet.,34749,2
34749,I spend more time fishing into my wallet than I do waiting in line to pay for things.,34749,2
34749,The worst: It's been two weeks since I bought this and it's already tearing at the seams.,34749,2
34749,"Also, the beautiful print on the outside has started to fade and rub off.",34749,2
34749,Waste of money since now I need a new wallet.,34749,2
34749,Note: Read the specifications.,34749,2
34749,This wallet is BIG.,34749,2
34749,It is not a standard pocket wallet size.,34749,2
34750,its silky js,34750,2
34751,Received quickly and fit as expected.,34751,2
34751,Thick fabric that isn't stiff.,34751,2
34751,2 stars due to main riveted button falling off during 2nd HOUR of wearing.,34751,2
34752,"Made cheap , thin material",34752,2
34753,I hated the pink color.,34753,2
34753,"I was hoping it would be more coral, but it is definitely pink.",34753,2
34753,I returned.,34753,2
34754,This was not a good choice for me.,34754,2
34754,I thought it was very tight and lesser quality.,34754,2
34755,The print faded the first wash and shrunk in dryer.,34755,2
34755,I bought it for my boyfriend and he is always a Meduim.,34755,2
34756,I bought a top from  this company before and thought I found a shop that I could get a consistantly sized tops.,34756,2
34756,"But when I ordered this top in the same size as the one I had bought previously is was way to small, so back it goes.",34756,2
34756,It also show this top in white and it was off white at best.,34756,2
34756,I do love their styles and the feel of the material so I might try another top in the future.,34756,2
34757,Who on earth decided on the sizing for these?,34757,2
34757,My daughter is a slim 11 year old who typically fits in the girls 10/12 size range.,34757,2
34757,I bought these in 7/8 (girls small) since she likes her tanks to be a little snug since she uses them as a layering piece.,34757,2
34757,The 7/8s were HUGE on her!!,34757,2
34757,"I was able to fit in them so I'd classify them as a small adult size, NOT girls size!!!",34757,2
34757,The quality was decent and had they been the correct size I would of kept them.,34757,2
34758,Cute robe and nice color but it was way too large and dragged on the floor so I ended up returning it.,34758,2
34759,"These PJs are really cute, but I have two significant issues with them.",34759,2
34759,"First, the sizing.",34759,2
34759,"I ordered two pairs, one for each of my kids.",34759,2
34759,"On both sizes, the tops run really small.",34759,2
34759,"The bottoms seem normal, maybe a bit small.",34759,2
34759,"Second issue, quality.",34759,2
34759,"They are very thin, especially for a winter pajama.",34759,2
34760,It was really big for the size.,34760,2
34760,"Also, the color was nowhere near the dark navy in the photo; it was more of a bright blue with a plastic sheen.",34760,2
34760,The texture was also very plastic-like.,34760,2
34760,I couldn't wear it.,34760,2
34761,gets scratched and stained very easily,34761,2
34762,"I'm a 34b and it didn't fit my boobs, the bottom part was fine.",34762,2
34762,But my boobs.,34762,2
34763,They were really cheap so that's a plus.,34763,2
34763,They look cheap (like colored glass) and the necklace seems very fragile.,34763,2
34763,Broke one of the metal bands very easily with little force.,34763,2
34763,"Not bad for the price; but, don't expect anything quality.",34763,2
34764,Nice but earrings are huge,34764,2
34765,I returned this because the text is grammatically wrong,34765,2
34766,Too small.,34766,2
34766,It doesn't fit to the eyes and head shape.it is in a very good condition and nice packaging.,34766,2
34767,This doesnt cover up my front.,34767,2
34767,Like I can't make it fully wrap around me.,34767,2
34767,"Which is why I bought it in the first place, to cover up my swim suit.",34767,2
34767,It's cute but doesn't fit like I wished it would.,34767,2
34767,I wear a large and bought and XL so I wouldn't have this problem but I did anyways!,34767,2
34768,Lace top seperated from stocking after only two times wearing them.,34768,2
34769,Top small,34769,2
34770,"has a weird fit, half the stuff was breaking off",34770,2
34771,Not as wide as I expected.,34771,2
34772,Would've given 5 stars but one look at the tag.,34772,2
34772,Made in China..... really?,34772,2
34773,way to small,34773,2
34774,A bit disappointed that these weren't longer.,34774,2
34775,The bracelet itself was georgous and I was extremely satisfied with with the way it looked and shined.,34775,2
34775,"However, the clasp was not able to open.",34775,2
34775,I see some other people have had the same problem as well.,34775,2
34775,"Eventually, I was able to pry it open and tamper with it a little so now it opens and closes correctly.",34775,2
34775,Now there are a few little scratch marks where I had to use pliers but I'll get over it.,34775,2
34775,It doesn't make sense why the company wouldn't test their product before distributing it.,34775,2
34776,I expected the spandex to be much more supported than what it actually is.,34776,2
34777,"Nice material, pretty suit!",34777,2
34777,.....Really bad fit.,34777,2
34777,Don't go by the size chart.,34777,2
34777,I got an xl because that what size it said i was supposed to order.,34777,2
34777,But when it came it came with super long side strings.,34777,2
34777,I should have gotten a medium.,34777,2
34778,does not run true to size,34778,2
34779,This blouse was huge.,34779,2
34779,I now wear it as a sleep shirt.,34779,2
34779,It is pretty though so I gave it 2 stars.,34779,2
34779,Love the color.,34779,2
34780,I bought a size XL for my wife and the dress that  I received was to small,34780,2
34781,great fit and material but definitely not worth the price...you can buy next level shirts on amazon for like around $10 with no logo and they are amazing.....,34781,2
34782,Very oversized !,34782,2
34782,Baggy and no pockets !,34782,2
34783,I ordered a small and it was too tight.,34783,2
34783,"For reference, I am 5'4"" and 108lbs.",34783,2
34783,The sizing chart is inaccurate.,34783,2
34784,Didn't even come to my panty line,34784,2
34785,"yaaa, i am 5' and 110lbs.",34785,2
34785,This thing is huge on me.,34785,2
34785,Cute top though :),34785,2
34786,"Not adjustable, clasp is ok but it is a rather large wrist band",34786,2
34787,too see through and makes the rolls/ fat on your body look bad if you have any,34787,2
34788,"I do a lot of sewing, so I inspected this garment when I got it.",34788,2
34788,One of the sleeves was missing the elastic.,34788,2
34788,"Honestly, I didn't even know it was supposed to have elastic in the sleeves until I saw one was missing.",34788,2
34788,It was very noticable with the dress on.,34788,2
34788,So I'm sending this back.,34788,2
34788,It was for an event I was attending that weekend and I really do love the dress but at this point I don't want another one.,34788,2
34788,"I could have just sewn elastic in the sleeve but I paid for a finished product, and that's what I was expecting.",34788,2
34788,The material is like a poly lycra blend - VERY stretchy so I probably could have sized down a size or even two sizes.,34788,2
34788,It's soft and flowy and doesn't fray to my knowledge.,34788,2
34788,I may order another one but not in the near future.,34788,2
34789,Looks nicer online than when you get it.,34789,2
34790,It was way smaller than I expected.,34790,2
34790,It is hard to find a shirt to wear under it.,34790,2
34790,It has an under shirt attached to it but only to about the middle of your stomach.,34790,2
34790,Overall it's just an awkward fitting shirt.,34790,2
34791,"It wasn't even the correct shirt, wrong picture..  2nd time trying to get this shirt",34791,2
34792,Runs small but WOW - runs REALLY small.,34792,2
34792,"Can't send it back because it's China so I am stuck with it, though they offered 10% off.",34792,2
34793,TOO SMALL.,34793,2
34793,"Bought a 2X, fits like a large.",34793,2
34793,Nice fabric.,34793,2
34793,Nice quality.,34793,2
34793,"Not too heavy, but still a winter topcoat.",34793,2
34794,"Not bad, but didn't resemble this hat in the photo.",34794,2
34794,It's really flimsy and had a few broken pieces on it.,34794,2
34795,"Cute style, but quality isn't great at all and WAY too short.",34795,2
34795,I haven't washed yet; it'll probably shrink even more.,34795,2
34795,Ugh.,34795,2
34796,"Purchased the largest size of  XXXL / US XXL  and was way, way way too small around and in the arms.",34796,2
34796,The overall length was okay and it seemed thick enough for a California autumn.,34796,2
34796,"For reference I am 5'2"" and float between dress sizes 8 & 10.",34796,2
34796,"At this time I only suggest this jacket for a tiny person or a child, they might love it.",34796,2
34797,These sandals are not white.,34797,2
34797,They are more of a yellow-cream.,34797,2
34797,"Although they were a perfect fit and very comfortable, I returned them because I wanted true white.",34797,2
34798,"Very comfortable, soft lace, but it is too low cut for me and not flattering on a smaller chest.",34798,2
34798,I'll be returning this.,34798,2
34799,"Shirt was way too small, I usually wear a xs - ordered a Medium and it's way too tight.",34799,2
34800,Fabric smells funny after you wash it,34800,2
34801,I should have ordered a size smaller,34801,2
34802,Would've been fine if it wasn't so big.,34802,2
34802,Will need to alter it.,34802,2
34803,"Instead of being flowy and loose like the picture, the top was TOO TIGHT and it it gets tighter towards the bottom of the shirt.",34803,2
34804,The bracelet looks very pretty; just as I got it I put it on and right away it broke by the clasp; not a good quantity at all.,34804,2
34805,too small,34805,2
34806,Felt cheap,34806,2
34807,I received this jumpsuit with high hopes that it would it would look great.,34807,2
34807,I got this in black and the Small.,34807,2
34807,"Well, small is a true understatement.",34807,2
34807,"Yes, it fit in the size regarding my weight BUT the length on the legs was about 1 1/2 feet too long!",34807,2
34807,"Literally, I measured it.",34807,2
34807,Almost 2 feet too long of fabric.,34807,2
34807,"I do not sew (maybe a rare button, that's it), but do not know how to hem pants.",34807,2
34807,I did not buy this in the event that I may need to hem it either and should not have to even consider this when purchasing anything unless it is stated somewhere before hand.,34807,2
34807,"This is a Small, not a Tall size.",34807,2
34807,"So, I have no idea why I am being sent such a long jumpsuit.",34807,2
34807,Someone 6 1/2 feet tall could wear it I guess.,34807,2
34807,"I mean, I would not have minded it little on the long side but this is unacceptable.",34807,2
34807,"I started a return to get refunded but I found out that the seller requires buyers to pay for return shipping.... on an item that's not as described, I don't think so.",34807,2
34807,"I gave it two stars still because the style is so cute, wish it worked.",34807,2
34807,Disappointed...,34807,2
34808,the picture and writing a on the shirt was very unsatisfactory.,34808,2
34809,Too small,34809,2
34810,I got the one that has the 6 straps in the back that point up in an upside-down V. I really really wanted to like this bra.,34810,2
34810,"In fact, when I first put it on and was admiring it in the mirror, I loved it!",34810,2
34810,It was so comfortable and the back is cute.,34810,2
34810,"Then, as I moved around a little, I realized that the design in the back isn't sewn into place.",34810,2
34810,"The straps are just looped around, so they shift and lose their shape.",34810,2
34810,The bra isn't as cute once the straps have started to shift.,34810,2
34810,"You might be thinking, well I'll just order a small size so it's nice and tight.",34810,2
34810,"You can do that, but if you have ANY back fat at all, even the slightest bit, this bra will emphasize it to the world.",34810,2
34811,Top fit fine but seems kind of lopsided.,34811,2
34811,The bottoms would fit someone maybe 100lbs.,34811,2
34811,"I'm 5' 2"" 125lbs 34C and wear a size 2 in pants.",34811,2
34811,If you have a booty this won't fit.,34811,2
34812,I let the spouse pick the outfit and did not pay attention to many of the details.,34812,2
34812,It is cheap polyester.,34812,2
34812,I know better and never intentionally buy dream girl products.,34812,2
34812,Well live and learn.,34812,2
34813,"The watch itself is quite attractive and nicely designed but the watch band is made of a leather that must have undergone some type of treatment to make it very glossy, rigid and actually stiff.",34813,2
34813,It will not sit nicely against the wrist and buckles up even when tight.,34813,2
34814,Shorter than it looks.,34814,2
34814,The back does not fit well it has elastic so it does not look as nice as in the front.,34814,2
34815,"I got the ""ash"" color, the Android and ""apple"" are the iron-on type and its shininess makes it so the apple doesn't really come across well.",34815,2
34815,"The one I got doesn't have much of a stem either, so it looks more like a burnt meatball.",34815,2
34815,The Android should definitely be 50% larger.,34815,2
34815,"Quality of the hat is nice, but I'll never wear it because I'd rather not keep explaining what it is supposed to be.",34815,2
34815,The photo looks much better than reality.,34815,2
34816,The patterns are awesome!,34816,2
34816,But they don't fit men!,34816,2
34816,Definitely for boys!,34816,2
34816,My husband is a very small man and these didn't fit over his heal!!,34816,2
34816,!,34816,2
34817,The zipper holder broke already.,34817,2
34817,Poor quality,34817,2
34818,"I bought a 17"" HP Envy and I am a huge fan of Captain America hence my choice for this sleeve.",34818,2
34818,This sleeve is very much to big for the Envy and there is no comfort padding in this product.,34818,2
34818,"In other words this is sleeve does not offer any form of protection to the Envy 17"".",34818,2
34818,I wanted to return but the hasell is just to much for me.,34818,2
34818,I will attach a pic later.,34818,2
34819,ordered usual size at least two sizes too small,34819,2
34820,This outfit was way too small for me.,34820,2
34820,"I'm an athletic muscular 5'6"" and 130lbs.",34820,2
34820,I read the reviews before purchasing which stated it ran small and is tight in crotch.,34820,2
34820,"Ladies, the crotch is not small but the torso runs short so it rides up.",34820,2
34820,If you're long in the midsection or have a long torso or waist this is a bad outfit choice for you.,34820,2
34820,I wish someone would of properly reviewed so I didn't order an outfit I can't wear.,34820,2
34820,The outfit is thin and tight and the material is stretchy.,34820,2
34820,If you're not looking for sexy don't order.,34820,2
34820,The shorts are tight and short.,34820,2
34821,Breast size is too small,34821,2
34822,I wear xlarge in other brands and i have problem.,34822,2
34822,I ordered 2 of the RBX leggings and they run very small.,34822,2
34822,i would say the xlarge are really a medium.,34822,2
34822,"Im not saying they are not good, im saying they run very small.",34822,2
34823,No pockets.,34823,2
34823,No return policy on the first one.,34823,2
34823,The o are not round but oval.,34823,2
34824,"They are not the most comfortable flip flop-I put an inner sole in and they feel "" just"" okay.",34824,2
34825,I'm 5ft 3in and weigh 138 and wear a size 36D bra so I usually wear a Petite Large.,34825,2
34825,I ordered the XL and the bust and the entire thing is too small but ordering a size larger will make this too long for me.,34825,2
34825,Returning it.,34825,2
34826,The material is that of a bathing suit and it is cut super short so some of my behind was exposed.,34826,2
34827,"Cute hat, but stretched out way too much after just one wear.",34827,2
34827,The size band is workthleas and loosens up way too easily.,34827,2
34827,And no my head is not huge.,34827,2
34828,"To me , they feel uncomfortable.",34828,2
34828,Maybe my feet are too sensitive.,34828,2
34828,Bought a few pairs but did not get to wear them.,34828,2
34829,Much too long.,34829,2
34829,"I'm going to give it to my 6'7"" son-in-law.",34829,2
34829,Will shop elsewhere for my rugby shirt.,34829,2
34830,"It was good to wear the first two times, but you to wash it eventually.",34830,2
34830,"And because it doesn't care for water, it won't last very long.",34830,2
34830,The lace on the front of the bra began to fall apart.,34830,2
34830,"I found that if you hand wash the bra with little water, the adhesion is still (somewhat) dependable.",34830,2
34830,It'd be nice of they sold them in a 3 pack or something.,34830,2
34831,Cheap material!,34831,2
34832,Way to small,34832,2
34833,Surprisingly poor quality for an American made product.,34833,2
34833,Poor quality control.,34833,2
34834,"The build quality is fine, but the front pockets are way too small.",34834,2
34834,I have around 9 Cabela's canvas shirts and they fit my iPhone 6S no problem.,34834,2
34834,I gave a couple of these a try and the phone barely fits in side to side and it sticks out the top of the pocket 2 inches.,34834,2
34834,I can not stress how tiny these pockets are.,34834,2
34834,"If you want the shirt to be functional, look elsewhere.",34834,2
34835,"instead of having the front tie cords starting at the sides and the elastic at the back, the tie goes all the way through so it defeats the purpose of an elastic back.",34835,2
34835,You have to untie every time you wanna take it off instead of it stretching over your backside.,34835,2
34835,"Otherwise, nice fit and length.",34835,2
34836,Wow funky shorts.,34836,2
34836,Got the size that is currently falling off me.,34836,2
34836,So the waist is ok.,34836,2
34836,"But I have to alterations to make them work, raise crotch, I am short, hem four to six inches, they will still be modest but no longer gauchos",34836,2
34837,"Very cheap material, not what I was imagining and croc like bottoms are very slippery.",34837,2
34838,Husband didn't like it.,34838,2
34838,He said it was too girly.,34838,2
34839,I love love leggings!,34839,2

34839,Way too small in the waist.,34839,2
34839,"I wear a large, ordered an xl and these are plain tight.",34839,2
34839,I had to rip 'em off due to feeling like a busted can of biscuits.,34839,2
34839,Two stars because they are opaque and the material is soft.,34839,2
34840,Looks great but will leave a mark on the child's head if size is to small,34840,2
34841,Didn't fit as expected even when I tried to tighten them.,34841,2
34841,:-/  Maybe I can convert them to regular earrings.,34841,2
34842,Pretty cheap material,34842,2
34843,I'm not really impressed.,34843,2
34843,Cheaply made.,34843,2
34843,"Just ""ok""",34843,2
34844,This tank is WAY short and the white printing sticks to itself so if you fold it you have to pull it apart!,34844,2
34845,Snaps on side not in same spot on each side,34845,2
34846,The top is way to big and the bottoms are way to small.,34846,2
34846,The bottoms look a a small or medium and the top is more like a 2x.,34846,2
34846,They are really off,34846,2
34847,I read the reviews here and was super excited to receive this.,34847,2
34847,I ordered a large based off reviews /size chart.,34847,2
34847,Sadly it was way too big to do any shaping if any kind.,34847,2
34847,"It was a really nice sturdy material, but it's useless for me at this size.",34847,2
34848,I thought it was a shame that I had to pay 3.00 to send it back,34848,2
34849,I failed to notice that these are not US sizes.,34849,2
34849,"They're made with excellent quality, they're just way too small.",34849,2
34850,Runs small!,34850,2
34850,Just like the pic,34850,2
34851,This top did not flatter my figure at all.,34851,2
34851,It was just too loose and baggy.,34851,2
34851,It was very shapeless.,34851,2
34851,I returned it.,34851,2
34852,"Very weird, stretchy fabric!",34852,2
34852,Lettering looks cheap.,34852,2
34852,I sent it back!,34852,2
34852,"Fit was okay, I ordered a large and I'm usually a small.",34852,2
34853,"I'm sure this would have been a great product, but mine arrived with the zippers already locked and with a code set.",34853,2
34853,I had to send it back because I couldn't get it open.,34853,2
34854,Didn't look.as nice as I thought,34854,2
34855,Zip keeps getting stuck.,34855,2
34855,"It doesn't look like the pic, its flat and poofy as you'd expect, also the finish is messy ad I had to be cutting away excess thread",34855,2
34856,Its super cute on.,34856,2
34856,Im 5ft7in and weigh 170.,34856,2
34856,Only thing is that the strap came off after i had just put it on.,34856,2
34856,The quality is very poor and that is why im giving it 2 stars.,34856,2
34856,Other than that it would have been a five.,34856,2
34856,Ill see if i can fix it because my hubby loved how it looked!,34856,2
34857,These look and sounded like what I was looking for until I put them on my shoes.,34857,2
34857,Followed the directions and started out for my walk.,34857,2
34857,I had not walked 1/2 mile before one came off.,34857,2
34857,Next night I didn't notice that one came off so I backtracked and found it less than 1/4 mile from my house.,34857,2
34857,Packaged these up and sent them back.,34857,2
34858,"Very cheap, if u can get them elsewhere, do",34858,2
34859,i didn;t love that much  https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41gzh-ADyrL._SS300_.jpg,34859,2
34860,The charm with the writing on it is so small you can barely see it.,34860,2
34860,You'd have to look REALLY CLOSE to see that it was actually writing.,34860,2
34860,"I was also disappointed with the size (it's really small) and the fact that it is two separate bracelets, as it shows the two conjoined in the pic.",34860,2
34860,"Further, there are two charms on the bracelet that don't show up in this picture that are round-ish and that do not really contribute to the beauty of the bracelet.",34860,2
34860,"Of course they can be removed, thus the ""charm"" part, but still - overall, I'd give this product a ""C.""",34860,2
34861,Cheap material...too small,34861,2
34862,"I like the fabric but the size is too small, too short.",34862,2
34862,It can be good for little girls.,34862,2
34862,I did order US size.(????),34862,2
34863,very thin material,34863,2
34864,The dress cups are to big the straps too loose.,34864,2
34864,Nothing compare to the look on the picture.,34864,2
34864,Try to return it but it costs more than the dress.,34864,2
34865,Very small!,34865,2
34866,Seems more like a little girl size not a ladies,34866,2
34867,"Didn't love this, I returned it.",34867,2
34867,"The color is not the same as pictured, and it does not fit the same as it looks in the picture.",34867,2
34867,Also the fabric is thin and not very comfortable.,34867,2
34868,I got this for the extra wide brim and the SNAP closure.,34868,2
34868,"I find the velcro that almost all hats have very annoying and it keeps getting my hair, so I thought this is it!",34868,2
34868,"Sadly, it was very uncomfortable.",34868,2
34868,I got a headache within 10 minutes of wearing it.,34868,2
34868,"It has no give and when I loosen it up so that it doesn't give me a headache it just slips off, and when it's snug and doesn't slip off it's uncomfortable.",34868,2
34868,"Then again, everyone's head is different, so it may work for others.",34868,2
34868,I bought a bunch of hats on Amazon (yay free returns) to see which would work best.,34868,2
34868,"The SunGrubbies went back, and so did the Wallaroo Sun Visor (not wide enough brim, but I liked the construction!).",34868,2
34868,I ended up keeping the cushees (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWUF22I/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10) and the Scala (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OWAB5RQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15).,34868,2
34868,"Sadly, both have velcro, but they have also material that is just a tad elastic so that it is more comfortable (again, for my own head).",34868,2
34868,Hope this helps!,34868,2
34869,The fit is not like pictured and is a bit more baggy.,34869,2
34869,"My biggest complaint is that the dye bleeds badly, even when washed in cold water.",34869,2
34869,"I got the red one and after the first wash it bled into the white lace at the top, so the shirt is now red and pink.",34869,2
34869,Really disappointed as I liked the shirt even if it was a little big.,34869,2
34870,"Sizing was right for me, i did expect it be a tunic shirt and cover my butt but thats not the case, its just a regular shirt.",34870,2
34870,The sleeves were so itchy where the sequins are.,34870,2
34870,"For what you pay its not a ""cheap"" shirt yet it was made cheaply.",34870,2
34870,There should be a fabric under the sequins for comfort.,34870,2
34871,Doesn't fit good,34871,2
34872,"Not very comfortable, rubs the ankle in the back",34872,2
34873,This looks so cute in the photos but when I tried it on my sister and mom both said that it looked like my grandmother cut a heavy doily up and put it on the shirt.,34873,2
34873,It's too bad because I was really looking for a nice feminine shirt.,34873,2
34874,Not in the least bit happy with this product.,34874,2
34874,First of call it smelled bad when it came out of the packaging and after carefully hand washing in cold water and laying flat to dry the sleeves shrank and it no longer looks anything like it's picture.,34874,2
34874,Don't waste your money.,34874,2
34875,I returned this bag.,34875,2
34875,I own two other Dooney bags and the quality of them are exceptional!,34875,2
34875,I didn't like the feel .......it was just way too thin and hard.,34875,2
34876,these are not genuine Toms,34876,2
34877,The sleaves were a little to big and the skirt portion a little small.,34877,2
34877,And the shade of yellow way lighter than expected.,34877,2
34878,"This shirt is way too big, it fits nothing like shown in the picture.",34878,2
34879,We like the necklace but the chain broke within two weeks of us having it.,34879,2
34880,I even bought a size larger and it was still too small,34880,2
34881,It has small size thou its 2x,34881,2
34882,Fits small,34882,2
34883,There is no way this product will fit me now.,34883,2
34883,Sinclair.,34883,2
34884,"This is a good looking watch, the construction materials are fairly cheap though.",34884,2
34884,"When I peeled the protective plastic film off of the watch face, it peeled up the ""Units Per Hour"" piece that borders the glass (see pictures).",34884,2
34884,It appears that it is a thin piece of metal that was poorly glued to the watch body.,34884,2
34884,"Like I said, it's a good looking watch, but poorly made.",34884,2
34884,I would not recommend this watch.,34884,2
34885,not at all comfortable,34885,2
34886,Not my favorite.,34886,2
34887,This shirt is huuugggeee!,34887,2
34887,Its cheap and smelled funny.,34887,2
34887,The material doesn't last.,34887,2
34887,"Order two sizes down, I don't even know what size I was sent because the shirt doesn't even have a tag.",34887,2
34887,It looks like a sheer cheap window curtain.,34887,2
34888,WAY too tight in the chest area.,34888,2
34888,There is absolutely no stretch in the material.,34888,2
34888,Item description is not accurate.,34888,2
34889,"I got the wrong color, I ordered Silver color but received light purple color.....I'm sending it back, even though the purse looks great, it will not serve the purpose of buying it.",34889,2
34889,I cannot pair purple color purse with silver color shoe....cant wait to get my money back.,34889,2
34890,Really disappointed in the lack of durability.,34890,2
34891,Cheap and catches on everything!,34891,2
34891,You can easily scratch yourself on rough ears.,34891,2
34892,Didn't want to send it back but it was too small.,34892,2
34892,When ordering you should order a size larger than what you would normally wear.,34892,2
34893,Cheaply made,34893,2
34894,Way bigger that expected,34894,2
34895,not as I expected - the material is too flimsy,34895,2
34896,Way too big to be knuckle rings and there are no varying sizes.,34896,2
34896,I do not have small fingers and they wouldn't stay on.,34896,2
34896,Cute rings though.,34896,2
34896,Just not good on the sizes.,34896,2
34897,The shirt quality is awful.,34897,2
34897,The print looks like crap too.. Don't waste your money!,34897,2
34898,"This is a pretty necklace, but the chain snapped the first time I wore it, with barely a pull.",34898,2
34899,Very nice shoe but runs small however the half size up was too wide for my foot,34899,2
34900,I couldn't fit my arms through the atm holes.,34900,2
34900,Colors look different in person- they remind me of Chicago bears colors.,34900,2
34900,I like how she the fabric was.,34900,2
34900,Perfect for summer.,34900,2
34901,Would not buy again,34901,2
34902,Somewhat large and seller sent me a round neckline when I ordered a V-neck as shown on the title and image.,34902,2
34903,"Great at first, in fit and shade!",34903,2
34903,The only thing is they rip very easily.,34903,2
34903,This pack was perfect for what I needed them for--I just used one each night of a weekend dance performance--but be sure to stretch them before and after putting them on to avoid early tears.,34903,2
34903,"It is unlikely that you will get them to last more than a day/night without ripping, but if you only need them briefly they are good.",34903,2
34904,Love the fit but unfortunately they are see through.,34904,2
34904,Hate when I see other women with this problem so you can imagine how disappointed I was!,34904,2
34905,Ok just too small for my curves,34905,2
34906,Not at all like pictured!,34906,2
34906,The pink is more peachy.,34906,2
34906,And there is two layer under the chiffon and the third is a short layer.,34906,2
34906,the material is a bit see thru and you can see the third short layer.,34906,2
34906,It didn't fit what i was looking for unfortunately.,34906,2
34907,"Didnt like it at all the zippers seem to fall more so i have to keep fixing them and the whole thing itself doesnt look too good, haven't worb it since i don't like it when ive tried it on.",34907,2
34908,I ordered another dress from this brand in M  but it was too big so I thought I'd be safe with a M in this one.,34908,2
34908,I was WRONG.,34908,2
34908,This dress is absolutely asian sizing and the measurements listed are NOT accurate.,34908,2
34908,I couldn't even get it on because the arms were so tight.,34908,2
34908,Back it goes!,34908,2
34908,"For reference, I'm 54 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28 waist 34 and ordered this in black/ Medium.",34908,2
34908,I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.,34908,2
34908,"I paid full price for this item and wasn't compensated in any way but would appreciate a ""yes"" click if you found my review helpful :)",34908,2
34909,Looks cheap.,34909,2
34909,Buttons are glued on with strings of glue visible.,34909,2
34909,Unfortunately the seller I bought from accepts returns but doesn't pay for them so I'm stuck with it.,34909,2
34910,"Too big, wouldn't let me return it without charge me disappointed but I still will buy from this seller.",34910,2
34910,Ordered large and it was baggy on me.,34910,2
34910,"I'm 5""7  135lbs",34910,2
34911,Not long enough and doesn't flow as pictured.,34911,2
34911,I'm big busted and unfortunately it fits extremely tight around the bust.,34911,2
34911,It also is virtually see through.,34911,2
34911,"Maybe can be a swimsuit cover up, but definitely not a dress.",34911,2
34912,Very thick eye frame.,34912,2
34912,No at all flattering.,34912,2
34913,One size doesn't fit all.,34913,2
34913,Gifted to another.,34913,2
34914,Sizes are smaller than usual.,34914,2
34914,Order one size bigger than u need.,34914,2
34914,Made cheaply,34914,2
34915,You have to have a huge butt to fit this.,34915,2
34915,"I had to cut it and tailor it myself to make it look right, and still ended up not wearing it day of.",34915,2
34916,trend over now,34916,2
34917,To small and I still haven't gotten the S*** man like ugh,34917,2
34918,"Though I took into account the corresponding size chart, these trousers turned out to be too big for me, so big that I don't think I'll ever get to wear them.",34918,2
34918,I look like a clown in them!,34918,2
34918,"I understand they're supposed to be loose, rather baggy perhaps, but I'd do much better with a one or even two-size smaller item.",34918,2
34919,"I like the style and fabric, but it was too large and puffy.",34919,2
34919,The sizing is a little odd.,34919,2
34919,Had to return it.,34919,2
34920,Faded  turned black  in two days !,34920,2
34920,Don't waste your money,34920,2
34921,Did not fit as per the size.,34921,2
34922,CHEAP,34922,2
34923,The rings are very pretty.,34923,2
34923,"I only get to wear them 3 days because of my job, I love the rings, but the rose color has worn off the rings, making them look silver.",34923,2
34923,Not happy with that.,34923,2
34923,"Plus, the stone setting is a little crooked, or twisted.",34923,2
34924,"ya I ordered the wrong size, plus I looked like a vampire.",34924,2
34924,but it is cute.,34924,2
34925,Claspe broke second time wirn,34925,2
34926,"The dress came early, and I was eager about that.",34926,2
34926,"However, when I tried it on, it was too small even though I ordered the size I have been wearing for years.",34926,2
34926,I don't have enough time to get a new one from the company of a different size so now I need to look for new dresses for my senior prom.,34926,2
34927,It was way bigger than expected.,34927,2
34927,It also was NOTHING like the photos.,34927,2
34927,"The photo shows it be cotton, but it was a shiny material, almost like workout clothes material.",34927,2
34927,Not flattering AT ALL.,34927,2
34927,"Very disappointed, because I've ordered Relipop clothes before and was very happy with my purchase.",34927,2
34927,"But this time, i feel like it was a dud.",34927,2
34928,Looks so good but fits too small.,34928,2
34929,washed out quickly,34929,2
34930,"I probably would have liked it but I've had to send it back, since it doesn't fit my galaxy S7.",34930,2
34931,Extreme small in the bust area.,34931,2
34931,If you have a large rib cage or boobs.,34931,2
34931,It won't even go over them,34931,2
34932,"This dress is not as pictured ,the quality is very cheap",34932,2
34933,buy the size of normal use on Amazon and is smaller.,34933,2
34933,This mislabeled,34933,2
34934,Kinda cheap :-( You can't read the words well because some of them are not filled in with the black.,34934,2
34934,Disappointed on my purchase.,34934,2
34935,"The legs are very long and the crotch is very tight - it's hard to zip over my son's diaper, even though the feet are baggy and sit about 4"" below his own feet.",34935,2
34935,And he's a pretty skinny kid; at 11 months old he's 18 lbs.,34935,2
34936,Supposed to be a XXL.,34936,2
34936,As soon as I took it out of the package I could tell they would be WAY too small.,34936,2
34936,Looked like a medium.,34936,2
34937,"Looks great on the model, but for me in was completely frumpy and unflattering.",34937,2
34937,No form to it at all.,34937,2
34937,I returned it.,34937,2
34938,"I wish I could give a great review, but the watchband came apart right after we got it, and it can't be repaired.",34938,2
34939,I like the shirt but it's so small compared to a comparable shirt in that same size.,34939,2
34939,I wasn't able to wear it for what I had planned.,34939,2
34940,Okay quality,34940,2
34941,Very cute but no stretch to it at all.,34941,2
34941,My toddler also has wide feet though.,34941,2
34942,The earings are beautiful but a stone was visibly missing!,34942,2
34943,Poor quality by the dozen.,34943,2
34943,Some of displayed colors not here.,34943,2
34943,Scratches easily if put with other things.,34943,2
34944,soso,34944,2
34945,The novelty sweater has  too many wires hanging on the inside they should have been lined on the inside to cover the wires so they wouldn't hang on your body or touch your body .,34945,2
34945,"My nephew came from London and bring one , it was very nice no wires were visible .",34945,2
34946,I thought they would be crew sock-like material but they were very elastic looking.,34946,2
34946,"Also, my legs are on the short side so these come all the way up to my crotch.",34946,2
34946,I don't find that attractive.,34946,2
34946,The tips also roll on these.,34946,2
34946,"Meaning, if you're moving around, expect them to start rolling down and looking weird.",34946,2
34946,"I'm thinking maybe if my thighs were thicker, they may not do that but that's something I'll never know.",34946,2
34947,BATHING SUIT IS EXACTLY AS PICTURE AND FITS IN HOW TIGHT IT IS BUT THE LENGTH OF IT IS MEANT FOR A CHILD.,34947,2
34947,I AM ALL OF 5' AND THE CUPS/TOP OF THE BATHING SUIT SITS BELLOW MY CHEST.,34947,2
34948,The button was broken when I received it but I had to wear it with a safety pin because I didn't have enough time to send it back to be replaced.,34948,2
34949,I got this watch on the last day of november.,34949,2
34949,"The body itself seems sturdy, but the inside decorations look pretty cheap.",34949,2
34949,"The same goes for the band, it started cracking pretty soon.",34949,2
34949,"My wrist has a circumference of 7 inches, the band fit well, with room to spare.",34949,2
34949,"I noticed while trying to wind it that it didn't work like other watches where you leave the pin down to wind, and lift it to adjust the time.",34949,2
34949,"Instead, I lifted the pin to adjust the time and it also wound the mechanism.",34949,2
34949,"Turning the pin in the down position did make that faint clicking ""winding sound"" but ultimately did absolutely nothing.",34949,2
34949,"This seemed like a failure in the manufacturing process rather than intentional, but I'm not sure.",34949,2
34949,The hands are pretty difficult to distinguish from the background.,34949,2
34949,"It's ok to tell the time in daylight, but in a darker environment (or if you have poor eyesight) it's pretty much useless.",34949,2
34949,It doesn't glow in the dark.,34949,2
34949,"The body of the watch is a half inch thick, which is quite substantial, so be advised.",34949,2
34949,"It kept time perfectly during the day, but it wouldn't keep running through the night unless I gave it a few good shakes before I put it away (to activate the winding mechanism that responds to movement).",34949,2
34949,"I didn't mind having to set it to the right time whenever I wore it though, but if this is a problem for you, again, be advised.",34949,2
34949,The band also started cracking pretty soon.,34949,2
34949,"I was actually considering getting a new band for it, but unfortunately the watch stopped working yesterday.",34949,2
34949,"I'm not sure what broke, but it won't even wind anymore.",34949,2
34949,"I didn't wear it every day, but I'd say I've worn it for about half of the time, so that would make it a month and a half (maybe two) of active usage.",34949,2
34949,"Because of this, I would definitely advise against buying this as a present for someone.",34949,2
34949,Unless you want to disappoint them.,34949,2
34949,"In conclusion, you get what you pay for.",34949,2
34950,"I like the product, but it runs small.",34950,2
34950,"I have similar ones, and these are by far smaller.",34950,2
34950,I had my child try them on and even she remarked on how small it felt.,34950,2
34951,to be honest this is judt like a 50 cent toy,34951,2
34952,I gave this shirt only 2 stars because the sizing is so misleading.,34952,2
34952,"I bought this for a friend who wears a large, bought it in a large, but it's more like a small.",34952,2
34952,I will be returning this and not sure if I'm going to order a larger size yet.,34952,2
34952,The shirt is high quality and really cute.,34952,2
34952,"If I do exchange for a larger size, I'll update my review.",34952,2
34953,These are ok.,34953,2
34953,They're very thin and don't stay up at all.,34953,2
34954,I ordered a small medium and usually wear small and they were a little too big.,34954,2
34954,They're wearable but just not as I expected them to fit.,34954,2
34954,They're still cute though.,34954,2
34955,I didn't like the quality of the printed words.,34955,2
34956,I ordered a 2XL because I read that you would need a size bigger.,34956,2
34956,Make that two sizes bigger.,34956,2
34956,Fits tight which is a shame since it's a nice looking sweater.,34956,2
34957,Way too big for regular prescription glasses.,34957,2
34958,"The bow in the back was not a bow, it was a piece of fabri, the pocket was falling apart when i recieved it.",34958,2
34958,Along with it being too small,34958,2
34959,"It's very cute, but not leather",34959,2
34960,Very disappointing.,34960,2
34960,"The opening is VERY small, and they are very flimsy so if you try and open them further at all they will immediately break.",34960,2
34960,They are a definitely a cheap novelty item.,34960,2
34960,Expect to be able to wear each ring once or twice but that's about it.,34960,2
34960,Not worth the price.,34960,2
34961,"Disappointing- flimsy plastic- I meant to order the better one, but got this one instead.",34961,2
34961,"Great for little kids, not for older ones.",34961,2
34962,Sizing in front was too short and back was very long.,34962,2
34963,"There's no support the straps are too thin,the design is nice but thts about it.",34963,2
34964,It arrived faster than expected except the fabric was not stretchy at all and was way smaller than it said!,34964,2
34965,It took almost 2 weeks for my shirts to be delivered.,34965,2
34965,"And when I finally got them, I was very disappointed to see that the back of the shirt doesn't have the logo shown on the picture.",34965,2
34965,There is nothing on the back.,34965,2
34966,"a little too loose on the front straps, they look a little cheap...not ordering it again",34966,2
34967,I was unaware that these came in such small sizes.,34967,2
34967,I got a 2x and they fit like a L women's.,34967,2
34967,It's very very tight and I probably will return them.,34967,2
34967,The threads were coming unraveled upon delivery as well.,34967,2
34967,"Aside from that, it's a decent pair of shorts.",34967,2
34968,I am an extra large and it shrunk into a large,34968,2
34969,Hat is to small and does not look like the picture.,34969,2
34970,Brought an 8.5 because I wear an 8 but should've gotten a 9.,34970,2
34971,It's made to look like denim but it's this cotton/spandex material.,34971,2
34971,It wasn't what I wanted to I gave it to my mom.,34971,2
34971,Save your money and get one from Target.,34971,2
34971,"Oh yeah, the pockets are fake.",34971,2
34971,No pockets.,34971,2
34972,Runs very small and I also thought it was going to be navy.,34972,2
34972,It is black.,34972,2
34972,Returning.,34972,2
34973,pants fit is ideal But am the pants are to long and  am just 5'1  they could have ben a shorter lenght petite.,34973,2
34974,The biggest minus is that the RFID of this wallet only blocks two things:  Jack and Squat.,34974,2
34974,The main reason I bought this was to ensure that my proximity chips in my IDs and cards stay safe.,34974,2
34974,"I had an old black RFID leather wallet from thinkgeek that has worn out, and it truly blocked everything.",34974,2
34974,"I performed the same tests with both wallets, using security badge proximity readers of different frequencies and manufacturers--HID systems and S2 systems.",34974,2
34974,They all went right through this wallet no matter what pouches I put the cards in.,34974,2
34974,It never blocked a single read attempt.,34974,2
34974,The old wallet blocked every read every time.,34974,2
34974,"Thought I'm hanging onto this as it is a nice brown wallet, I want others to know that if RFID is a requirement, you should pick a different wallet.",34974,2
34974,"When travelling, I will move all my goods to my worn-out wallet.",34974,2
34974,"On other notes, I like the size and feel of the wallet.",34974,2
34974,"Yes, the credit card pouches are tight, but are breaking in already and pulling out cards is not an issue after a few days.",34974,2
34975,I was shocked when I opened the box because the earrings are so small!,34975,2
34975,"I thought they were climbers, hence, much longer.",34975,2
34976,Item runs very small.,34976,2
34977,Weird cut is a bit tight and awkward around the chest.,34977,2
34977,Fabric doesn't really feel like clothing fabric,34977,2
34978,The shirt is as described but the arms are SEVERLY TIGHT LIKE WHAT OTHERS STATED.,34978,2
34978,You have to have super skinny arms.,34978,2
34978,"I am known for having ""small arms"" and the arms are just plain ridiculous",34978,2
34979,cheap,34979,2
34980,Looks really good but size fitting is way too small,34980,2
34981,The chest was way too wide and the dimensions off.,34981,2
34982,Looks nice but my husband said it's a little sharp so he is afraid to put on his key ring.,34982,2
34982,Will try to smooth the edges a bit.,34982,2
34983,"The blouse is nice, but too small for the size it's supposed to be.",34983,2
34984,A 2XL should be roomier!!,34984,2
34984,!,34984,2
34985,Material is nice but the EU size on the skirt does not match the US size chart.,34985,2
34985,The EU size on the skirt is much much smaller.,34985,2
34985,I would estimate the EU size is 3 sizes smaller.,34985,2
34986,"It's cheaply glued, cheap metal.",34986,2
34986,"When mine arrived, it was broke in two places.",34986,2
34986,Not even worth $2.,34986,2
34987,"I returned the dress because I did like it, some how this dress didn't fixed me nice, i didn't like the way this DR was made.",34987,2
34987,I tried on and the zipper area had a problem.,34987,2
34987,Let me tell I contacted the  seller because I needed to pay to return the item back.,34987,2
34987,I lost $7.69 dollars to send this dress back to the seller.,34987,2
34988,Ordered the swimsuit with black strappy bottoms and received plain black ones.,34988,2
34988,Very disappointing.,34988,2
34988,Ordered a medium and it took over a month to receive.,34988,2
34988,im a 36 D and the top is loose.,34988,2
34988,"The bottoms fit but then again, they were not the ones I wanted.",34988,2
34989,It's a pretty dress.,34989,2
34989,But I normally wear a small so I ordered extra large.,34989,2
34989,I couldn't even get it over my head.,34989,2
34989,I think it's for a child.,34989,2
34989,It is lovely though.,34989,2
34989,Wish I could have worn it.,34989,2
34990,Ok,34990,2
34991,"This fabric is soft, but the sizing is very small.",34991,2
34992,It's a little big not real big but bigger than I wanted,34992,2
34993,I had high hopes for these skirts but the fit left a lot to be desired.,34993,2
34993,Not flattering at all.,34993,2
34993,"Lovely color but the material seemed cheap but for the price, I should have expected it.",34993,2
34994,Material not  what expected.,34994,2
34994,Bad material.,34994,2
34994,Uggly,34994,2
34995,Had to put pants under this way to short,34995,2
34996,its already pilling and I've only worn it a couple of times.,34996,2
34996,"the shoulder opening isn't as wide as appears in the photo, which is what I wanted because I love the ballet neck.",34996,2
34996,Would not recommend.,34996,2
34997,Size  was  not  accurate,34997,2
34998,I was pretty disappointed with this purchase.,34998,2
34998,"In the picture the fabric looks kind of matte, but in real life it was very thin and a kind of scratchy chiffon material.",34998,2
34998,My main complaint are the enormous shoulder pads that are mentioned nowhere in the description.,34998,2
34998,"Also, the pockets look funny.",34998,2
34998,All in all not Allegra K's best work.,34998,2
34998,"It did ship quickly though, and was pretty true to size.",34998,2
34999,Material is more like a nylon tent.,34999,2
35000,Sizing is off the quality is not good.,35000,2
35000,"There's nothing to finish the bottom, no lace no nothing.",35000,2
35000,Ordered two in two colors returned both for refund.,35000,2
35001,"Ok so according to that there size chart I am a solid size small, the measurements posted are almost EXACTLY my measurements.",35001,2
35001,When the bikini arrived it was waaaaay too big!,35001,2
35001,The bottom was ~almost~ the right size but you could probably have fit 2 of me in the top.,35001,2
35001,Sizing chart is really unaccurate!,35001,2
35001,Had to return it because I couldn't wear it!,35001,2
35002,Short and small,35002,2
35003,These were very very cute however they ripped the first night I wore them.,35003,2
35003,The sizing wasn't clear when I bought them and when I received the packaging it had a checkbox for Small/Med or Med/Large but still didn't indicate which was in the bag?,35003,2
35003,I am 5'9 and 135lbs and they were a little snug which is why they probably snagged at the top.,35003,2
35003,I would suggest if you are over 5'7 to get the Med/Large sizing.,35003,2
35003,They were very comfy and so cute just mad they ripped.,35003,2
35003,"I used them as part of my Halloween costume so they served their purpose for the night, however I would have totally used them again... :(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonas-Women-s-Sexy-Stylish-Wave-Zigzag-Pattern-Pantyhose-S-M-Black/dp/B00QYVJXJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonas Women's Sexy Stylish Wave Zigzag Pattern Pantyhose (S/M, Black)</a>",35003,2
35004,Never got to wear because the chain broke right after coming out of the package.,35004,2
35004,"PLUS the fake ""gem"" on the ring came unglued and fell off while trying to repair the chain!",35004,2
35004,Would be cute if it wasn't so cheaply made.,35004,2
35004,"Would cost too much to return, so I kept it but haven't been able to wear it.",35004,2
35005,small fitting,35005,2
35006,"Although it was a cute design, I was not a fan of this suit.",35006,2
35006,"The bottoms fit nicely, but the top was kind of flimsy and did not have enough support for my DD chest, causing the back band to ride up awkwardly over my shoulder blades.",35006,2
35006,"So, unfortunately I will be returning this one.",35006,2
35006,"Could definitely work for somebody with a smaller chest, though.",35006,2
35007,everything fits but my butt hangs out of the shorts.,35007,2
35007,damn.,35007,2
35008,Pack did arrive on time but didn't get the light pink one that is shown in the picture!,35008,2
35009,Wish it were bigger.,35009,2
35010,The bracelet is very nice but the stone fell out so I returned it and got a heavier one :(,35010,2
35011,I bought this bathing suit in the size I normally buy.,35011,2
35011,The bottoms fit perfectly but the top is way to small.,35011,2
35011,I read all the reviews and thought I was buying the right size for my top.,35011,2
35011,I am a 36ddd and this didn't even hold a third of my sisters.,35011,2
35012,It was to big,35012,2
35013,"Adorable print, but measurements listed for sizes aren't accurate at all.",35013,2
35013,"I ordered the medium, and expected the bust to be at least 36 inches (my bust is 35.5, so it was just about perfect), but the bust on this was definitely closer to 32.",35013,2
35013,I was smooshed!,35013,2
35014,The coat was much bigger than I expected.,35014,2
35014,My bf has 43in.,35014,2
35014,shoulders at 36inch waist.,35014,2
35014,"Slightly too big in the shoulders and the waist in the picture looks somewhat fitted, but the coat is very wide in the waist.",35014,2
35014,"Also, it is a synthetic blend of acrylic, wool, and cashmere.",35014,2
35014,"Somehow, I thought it would be wool and cashmere and a heavier coat, than this one.",35014,2
35014,"I thought this coat has free returns, but I need to pay to ship it back, so I won't be trying another coat from this company.",35014,2
35014,"Too bad, style is really nice.",35014,2
35015,Cute but a little flimsy.,35015,2
35016,Disappointed.,35016,2
35016,"Emoji earrings are huge, too big for 10 year old.",35016,2
35016,Post broke off right away.,35016,2
35017,This is not what's in the picture it looks very cheap and like it's sleepwear.,35017,2
35017,......DO NOT BUY......IT'S A RIP OFF,35017,2
35018,I took it out of the package and didn't even bother to TRY to put this on.,35018,2
35018,Gave to my granddaughter.,35018,2
35018,Color was nice.,35018,2
35019,"The item looks good once you unfold it and bend the wires properly, but it is made out of cardboard and styrofoam, connected by wire and gauze.",35019,2
35019,I wouldn't complain except for the fact that it cost $47!!!!,35019,2
35019,Insane for what it is.,35019,2
35019,Go to a party store so you know what you're paying for.,35019,2
35020,Just too small,35020,2
35021,Just bad quality in my opinion.,35021,2
35021,The scallops are loose and don't fit to your body.,35021,2
35022,"It's what it looks like, and it came on time.",35022,2
35022,But the sizing is  ridiculous.,35022,2
35022,I'm normally a medium and I ordered a xl and the top was so small it looked like a size small.,35022,2
35023,I bought this for my 16 month old son in hopes it would make it harder for him to get into his diaper and smear poop everywhere.,35023,2
35023,"The neck scoops down to a near-scandalous depth, which allowed him to slip out of the outfit completely.",35023,2
35023,"From there, because perhaps he sensed my intention to bar him from his private parts, he went even farther and completely removed his poop-filled diaper.",35023,2
35023,"It's possible I'm having problems larger than what a soccer ball romper can solve, but I certainly didn't expect this new outfit to make the problem *worse*",35023,2
35024,Worth all of TWO dollars.,35024,2
35024,Dont order this.,35024,2
35025,The bottoms fit perfect but the top was too big.,35025,2
35025,I am a size 2 and a 32C  bra and I just could not get a right fit!,35025,2
35025,Sad because i loved this suit for laps at the gym!,35025,2
35026,Cheap material.,35026,2
35026,Not as nice as other things I ordered off Amazon,35026,2
35027,Even though the outside part of sock did not slip it did inside the sock.,35027,2
35028,It's ok.... the boobs were a bit small... but it could pass..,35028,2
35029,"I'm a pretty fit triathlete, so tight and short doesn't usually bother me.",35029,2
35029,But.these leggings are the least forgiving pants I've ever put on.,35029,2
35029,"You can see every unflattering blemish... the color is great, but that's the only redeeming feature here.",35029,2
35030,Had to return for defect,35030,2
35031,"The hat seems to be of good material, looks nice and is adjustable.",35031,2
35031,"However, I have 2 issues with this purchase.",35031,2
35031,"For one, it did not fit as expected, I ordered an adult size hat.",35031,2
35031,The hat I received was made for a child 5 years old or younger.,35031,2
35031,It would not even fit my daughter who is very petite.,35031,2
35031,"Secondly, the bill length is very short compared to the dozens of other hats I own.",35031,2
35031,"In summary, I would only recommend this hat for a small kid.",35031,2
35032,The shoes arrived on time and fit to size however after 15 minutes of our first run on the skates one of the wheels would not stay in the down position.,35032,2
35033,"Runs, two sizes too small.",35033,2
35033,Wife finds it very uncomfortable.,35033,2
35033,"I'm sure if you got one that was a little too big, it would be very awkward fitting.",35033,2
35033,"I think for just the right body type, this would be flattering...finding that body type is the trick...and then trying to get just the right size.",35033,2
35033,Material is cheap.,35033,2
35034,returned; straps too complicated,35034,2
35035,Too small in sizing.,35035,2
35036,I didn't care for this bag once I got it.,35036,2
35036,"I agree that it had a smell to it when I first opened it, but after airing out, it's fine.",35036,2
35036,It's bigger than I thought it would be and just not really what I expected.,35036,2
35037,Won't look as nice after the first wash. Snags begin to appear immediately.,35037,2
35037,Sad because they are warm.,35037,2
35038,This shirt was so thin you could see my tattoos right through the shirt.,35038,2
35038,"It also did not come with the string laced up through the shirt, I had to do it myself and it didn't come out as pretty as the picture.",35038,2
35038,It does fit true to size though.,35038,2
35039,"I didn't like the way the costume fit; it was loose in part, and tight in other parts.",35039,2
35039,I couldn't carry it off.,35039,2
35039,It didn't flatter.,35039,2
35040,"This has is not felted wool, it is some sort of weird artificial material.",35040,2
35040,"It looked cute, but I am not interested in artificial materials.",35040,2
35040,"I didn't bother to attempt returning the item, I just gave it away.",35040,2
35041,Size was WAY too small.,35041,2
35041,"Returning for refund,  Will stick to Fruit of the Loom from now on.",35041,2
35042,Disappointed that it ran small.,35042,2
35042,Sent back.,35042,2
35042,It has a wintery scene I thought I could wear throughout the winter versus a Christmas image that would be one season only.,35042,2
35042,Kind've cute and homey,35042,2
35043,"Really cute, but the screws are coming out already.",35043,2
35043,"My girl is 2 and wanted green glasses, but she pulled & played with the hinges too much so, really not as much give as there should be.",35043,2
35043,I might just get some used professional glasses @ the thrift shop & pop the lenses out.,35043,2
35044,"The bag is ok, certainly fine for the money.",35044,2
35044,"I might have enjoyed it, but it came marked several times with some kind of black.",35044,2
35044,"I cannot tell if it is marker ink or scuffing, but if it is the latter, then I would have preferred to have had the opportunity to have scuffed it myself!",35044,2
35044,Maybe they were just saving me the trouble.,35044,2
35044,";-)  Seriously, such marks indicate to me that it would not wear well, so in reality, they did me a favor.",35044,2
35044,I am in the process of returning it.,35044,2
35044,The seller was responsive and I received it in a very timely manner.,35044,2
35044,"However, in the name of quality control, this bag should not have passed any kind of inspection, if there was one.",35044,2
35045,Not really excited about the fit.,35045,2
35045,I wear a medium and every thing I ordered is just a little bit small.,35045,2
35046,More description would be helpful.,35046,2
35046,It is kinda pretty minus the setting for he stone being a skull.,35046,2
35046,Really?,35046,2
35046,WTH?,35046,2
35047,Cute but to small.,35047,2
35048,Arrived without the inserts-should I have know that?,35048,2
35048,I cut some out myself from some leftover felt I had on hand and went on using the necklace as designed.,35048,2
35048,"Unfortunately one side of the decorative cover became tarnished within a week (DoTerra oils) so, needless to say, I am not impressed.",35048,2
35049,"Just didn't fit right,  oddly made.",35049,2
35049,Low quality,35049,2
35050,"I ordered my usual size M, but these fit tighter than the black pair I ordered in the same size.",35050,2
35050,Not sure I like the color.,35050,2
35050,It's not a true Navy.,35050,2
35050,I'm not sure about the material either because it's little too thin.,35050,2
35050,"Since these are a little tighter than I wanted, I will return them.",35050,2
35050,Don't love them.,35050,2
35051,the sizing is to big,35051,2
35052,"the fabric wrinkles so much and unless you enjoy using an iron and board, no dice.",35052,2
35052,"I wore the blouse to try out, sorry I did.",35052,2
35052,"From now on I will read all the details about the fabric, what it is and is not....so sorry for this purchase.",35052,2
35053,Cute shoe but it just was too narrow and one size too small.,35053,2
35054,"This is a great product if you don't like to sit, eat, drink, bend, arch, or breathe.",35054,2
35054,Plus all that fat you're trying to hide in the first place?,35054,2
35054,"Yeah, it either goes up or it goes down.",35054,2
35054,So you end up with a second pair of boobs or a really awkward and misshaped butt.,35054,2
35055,too small!,35055,2
35056,Outfit didn't fit as expected.,35056,2
35056,"I am 4'11, i wear a 14 in jeans.",35056,2
35056,I have a huge butt and thighs.,35056,2
35056,I ordered a Large (normally wear a XL).,35056,2
35056,The bottom is too big and the top is too small.,35056,2
35056,Will be returning the outfit!,35056,2
35057,Looks like it was worn before,35057,2
35058,not worth it,35058,2
35059,fits small,35059,2
35060,"was not for winter use,",35060,2
35061,It's very cute bt I cud not wear this I got a large and it was still too small,35061,2
35062,I love the skirt.,35062,2
35062,"However, I am a size 4 and the skirt was too tight about the waist!",35062,2
35062,I was shocked really.,35062,2
35062,The skirt itself is beautiful and a nice material but I had top return it.....,35062,2
35063,Pretty cheap plasticy material!,35063,2
35063,Didn't like it at all!,35063,2
35064,"Runs very small and is no anything like the picture there is a 1/2slip underneath a single layer of toule - very cheap looking (yes, you get what you pay for, but not what's pictured)",35064,2
35065,Runs small,35065,2
35066,"These bottoms are cute, but a bit clingy.",35066,2
35066,"I'm worried they'll be see-through when wet, so I haven't tried them out in public yet :/",35066,2
35067,way too big,35067,2
35068,Nice hoodie.,35068,2
35068,Does not fit as expected.,35068,2
35069,"I normally wear a 10 1/2 shoe, so after reading the reviews I knew I had to get a bigger size.",35069,2
35069,"All I can say is not only wasn't an 11 big enough, but they are cut so awkwardly that even if my toes were not all scrunched up they were rubbing on various other parts of my feet (top, side, etc).",35069,2
35069,"I understand they are for a costume, but I had to leave a Halloween party early because I was in so much pain after only a few hours.",35069,2
35069,I would not recommend these to anyone that needs to spend any amount of time walking around.,35069,2
35069,"For pictures maybe, but no walking or just go a few sizes bigger and uses different thicknesses of socks to get them to fit.",35069,2
35069,"I would have only given them one star, but they look pretty good and really did make the costume",35069,2
35070,The shirt was wide and short and the print came off in the first wash even though I washed delicate.,35070,2
35071,Made way to small.,35071,2
35071,I had to give it away....More hassle than worth to exchangel;,35071,2
35072,It is not what I thought it would be.,35072,2
35072,Not heavy duty enough for the purpose I bought it for.,35072,2
35073,"So the black dress (not sure about the other colors just the black one) has NO liner it's more of a cover up than a ""dress.""",35073,2
35073,"The material is very thin and sheer, it wasn't totally see through but I feel like if you were to wear it anywhere other than someplace with dim indoor lighting you'll be able to see through it.",35073,2
35073,"The slit is about 3 inches max (and I'm being generous, it's probably closer to 2 inches) below your crotch.",35073,2
35073,So if you do purchase this I would highly recommend a black slip so you aren't accidentally flashing everyone your lady bits.,35073,2
35073,Also the chest did not lay nicely.,35073,2
35073,"The cut is obviously revealing, but as a 34DD it just didn't lay right and was pulling at the chest so that you could see pretty much my whole boob if you were looking at me from any angle other than straight on.",35073,2
35073,I got a size medium based on the measurements from the seller so maybe if I sized up it would be better - but because it's so sheer and there's no liner I don't feel like I'll like it even if it did fit better.,35073,2
35073,"So the chest was an issue but so was the loops for the belt, which is totally for show and not at actual belt.",35073,2
35073,The loops stuck out so far that it ruined the sight lines of the dress.,35073,2
35074,It wasn't what I expected.,35074,2
35075,ordered two pair.,35075,2
35075,one pair broken not repairable.,35075,2
35076,Apparently they are just not my thing.,35076,2
35077,"Too small, was not able to get on my head.",35077,2
35077,Would not recommend or purchase again.,35077,2
35078,"The crotch is really, really long.",35078,2
35078,They are pretty comfy though.,35078,2
35078,The stitching ripped by my left calf three days after I got them.,35078,2
35079,Cheap quality,35079,2
35080,logo was a bit thick and bulky.,35080,2
35080,didn't like it,35080,2
35081,not the size advertized,35081,2
35082,The top is too big and the bottom is too small.,35082,2
35082,Didn't like the quality.,35082,2
35082,Item returned.,35082,2
35083,So tight.,35083,2
35083,Did not feel confortable.,35083,2
35084,The gloves were too small even though I ordered my usual size.,35084,2
35084,"I don't have particularly large hands, so was very disappointed.",35084,2
35085,looked cheap so I returned it.,35085,2
35086,Top fit but the bottom was waaay large.,35086,2
35087,If I had to buy it again I probably wouldn't.,35087,2
35088,pretty cheaply made .,35088,2
35088,its pretty but not practical.,35088,2
35089,I ordered the pink dress.... the dress I received is red.,35089,2
35089,Very red.,35089,2
35090,its ok,35090,2
35091,Very cute suit.,35091,2
35091,Just poor material.,35091,2
35091,Had the feeling the crochet was going to rip if I wasn't careful.,35091,2
35091,Definitely runs small too.,35091,2
35091,"I'm 5""5 and 150lbs for reference and I got a large and xl and even the xl was too small for my hips.",35091,2
35091,Padded bust is cheap.,35091,2
35092,Picture doesn't reflect what I received.,35092,2
35092,Disappointed.,35092,2
35093,Too large in the ankles.,35093,2
35094,It looked like some sort of Halloween costume.,35094,2
35094,"I give props thought to whoever made it because the design is cute,but they gave me a belt that was too small and a dress too big.",35094,2
35095,"Great idea, but the socks themselves fit poorly.",35095,2
35095,"Ok for our young daughter, but not for any of the adults.",35095,2
35095,One pair came with a hole in the heel.,35095,2
35095,Pretty annoyingly disappointing.,35095,2
35096,The case look good and does the job to protect eyeglasses.,35096,2
35096,I am giving low review to this product because hinges broke in less than 90 days,35096,2
35097,.... Too big...,35097,2
35097,I'm about 5'9 200lbs... ordered size XL,35097,2
35098,Its not a dress at all it fits like a shirt.,35098,2
35099,Looks exactly like picture and fits very well.,35099,2
35099,My only caveat is the material is thin and will probably on last for one wear.,35099,2
35099,Some of the stitching was coming out on the back.,35099,2
35099,I will probably have to take this to the cleaners to have another layer of stitching added for assurance.,35099,2
35100,Right style however the gauge is incorrect.,35100,2
35100,"Ordered as 20g but when compared to my original 20g nose screw among some 20g nose hoops I ordered, these are MUCH thinner.",35100,2
35100,I'm assuming they are close to 22gauge.,35100,2
35100,The hassle of returning the items isn't worth it.,35100,2
35101,The straps of this bra fit really strangely--like they're spaced very far apart as if for a person with really broad shoulders.,35101,2
35101,I don't wear it.,35101,2
35102,dosent cover breast at all material not so good 40dd,35102,2
35103,It arrived sooner than advised.,35103,2
35103,Was very pleased to be able to give it to my nephew for Christmas.,35103,2
35103,"He has worn it 3 times and I've had to replace 2 pins, already.",35103,2
35104,I love the message on this shirt but the shirt its self is so poor its pathetic I can see straight through the shirt it's self on top of the the print is already peeling off I just received it this morning Aug 1st 2016  I highly do not recommend buying this shirt because you will be very disappointed in the quality of the shirt and the print it's self very cheap made better off going and paying $30 to have it made professionally and a good quality shirt.,35104,2
35105,for the price...I expected better fabric.,35105,2
35105,After the first wash it didn't keep its shape either.,35105,2
35106,"Have to agree with both previous reviewers, this sweater is wider than it is long.",35106,2
35106,I thought maybe it would work for me but its just way too wide to work.,35106,2
35106,Will be returning.,35106,2
35107,"I never wear it because it doesn't fit the ladies well, would work better if you don't have curves.",35107,2
35107,The lace is nice and the material is thick though.,35107,2
35107,Maybe I can re-purpose it.,35107,2
35108,"Cheap, do not buy",35108,2
35109,They were way to big,35109,2
35110,wrong choice of item.,35110,2
35110,It wasn't what I expected,35110,2
35111,"Cute, but don't fit my ears at all, and are uncomfortable.",35111,2
35111,Disappointed :(,35111,2
35112,I looked at this dress for a month and decided to order.,35112,2
35112,It's came and it's not exactly what I was expecting.,35112,2
35112,It is very shiny and stretchy.,35112,2
35112,It looks like a night gown.,35112,2
35113,These fit larger than expected and they get very point once you get in the water.,35113,2
35113,They aren't adjustable like I had expected.,35113,2
35113,The snaps are for easy removal after you have them on.,35113,2
35113,I feel they are just too big overall.,35113,2
35113,"I prefer the Finis brand which fit my daughter better and are smaller, tighter, and would actually hold in an accident compared to this diaper which is just to big, bulky and loose.",35113,2
35113,"My daughter is 15 1/2 months, 20 lbs 14 oz and 30.5"".",35113,2
35113,Maybe next summer these diapers will fit better.,35113,2
35113,But they still absorb so much water that I doubt I will keep them to find out.,35113,2
35114,Loved this for the first day I wore it... everyone complimented me.,35114,2
35114,Next day though all the shiny pieces forming the cross were falling off..,35114,2
35115,Too short in the legs.... :(,35115,2
35116,Very cheap looking crystals.,35116,2
35116,Cloudy as heck...,35116,2
35117,"Usually in this brand, I'm 9 1/2 and that's what I ordered but, the sandals were like a 10 1/2  I was very disappointed
If I had know, I would've ordered one size smaller.",35117,2
35117,"However, thery're beautiful I gave them to my mom.",35117,2
35118,Yyeeeeaaa doesn't feel anything like it looks in the picture.,35118,2
35118,The material might as well be plastic.,35118,2
35118,"Though if you can deal with that, it looks alright.",35118,2
35119,"I really don't like it, I thought it would train one eye.",35119,2
35120,WAY TOO SMALL.,35120,2
35120,"I ordered a medium, but the funky cut of this top warranted a size XL which is unheard of in my closet.",35120,2
35120,"The fabric is very thin and would require an undershirt, for sure, as the front is super sheer and the back is totally see-through.",35120,2
35120,"Two stars though, as it is an adorable top.",35120,2
35121,Runs a full two sizes small.,35121,2
35122,"So I got this top to wear to a holiday party, when I got it I tried it on and come to find out one of the clips on the back was literally sewn on upside down, I didn't have time to return it so I had to undo it and sew it correctly myself.",35122,2
35122,"Also i used the size chart to order, I was considered a small (5'1"", 107#, 32c) and it was a little large.",35122,2
35122,I should've gone with xs...but now I can't return it cuz I had to re-sew it.,35122,2
35123,"Ordered a 3X, it is actually the size of a US medium.",35123,2
35123,No kidding.,35123,2
35123,Not as long as the picture either.,35123,2
35123,"I usually wear a womans xlarge, I will be giving this to my niece, Size way up.",35123,2
35124,This is made of a very odd material; does not feel like silk and has a funny odor.,35124,2
35124,"I cannot read any of the garment label because it is just a tiny scrap of material written in Chinese characters, no washing instructions or material contents or anything.",35124,2
35124,I would not order again.,35124,2
35125,"These are NOT ""easy on.""",35125,2
35125,TOO narrow and poorly designed.,35125,2
35125,They are very difficult for my almost 4 year old to get on.,35125,2
35125,Waste of money.,35125,2
35125,"They seem warm, so gave a start for that.",35125,2
35126,A bit smaller than expected.,35126,2
35126,Necklace is super adorable though,35126,2
35127,"Was not what I expected, too small to hold everything that I carry on a day to day basis.",35127,2
35127,When pulling out one thing like my wallet very difficult to put back...,35127,2
35128,They were to small and I couldn't return them,35128,2
35129,Cute shirt.,35129,2
35129,Waaaay too small.,35129,2
35129,XL fits like med.,35129,2
35130,"Shrank alot, kept its width and shrunk alot in the length.",35130,2
35131,It's a nice sweatshirt but it runs extremely small.,35131,2
35131,"I bought a large for my daughter, who is about 5' 6"" tall and wears a size 0, and it was too small.",35131,2
35131,"The length was short, barely came to her hips.",35131,2
35132,cut soooo small,35132,2
35133,"Cheap metal caused infection, ball would fall off constantly on",35133,2
35134,It's not really like the picture.,35134,2
35135,The fabric quality was not what I expected.,35135,2
35135,"Tight at the bottom,hard to walk with.",35135,2
35136,Was looking for something affordable for an all white event.,35136,2
35136,After reading the reviews I decided to purchase a Medium AND a Large.,35136,2
35136,They arrived quickly.,35136,2
35136,The first I noticed was that the color is not crisp white (like in picture).,35136,2
35136,it is more an off white or bone colored.,35136,2
35136,I am 5'2.,35136,2
35136,the large dress was extremely short in the front.,35136,2
35136,No need to lift the dress to go to the bathroom length in the front.,35136,2
35136,The back was fine.,35136,2
35136,The material ...well its 20.00 worth.,35136,2
35136,If I would have purchased an XL I would have been swimming in the dress.,35136,2
35136,The manufacturer needs to add at lease  4 to 5 inches in the front to avoid these problems...,35136,2
35137,"looks great, but the links gets disconnected sometimes, I lost a part of it already",35137,2
35138,"The strap is leather , not my st",35138,2
35139,color is not as described.,35139,2
35139,It is not stone.,35139,2
35139,It is a tan or beige.,35139,2
35140,Returning because they're small.,35140,2
35140,"The elastic around the waist is also really narrow, so it digs into your belly - not flattering.",35140,2
35140,"The material feels cheap, and the print doesn't look as good as on screen.",35140,2
35140,Don't think they'd hold up well.,35140,2
35141,Returned - too large,35141,2
35142,I bought this purse in black months ago.,35142,2
35142,"I love that purse, exactly what I wanted.",35142,2
35142,So I decided to buy another in the cream color.,35142,2
35142,"But this one, although is supposed to be the same purse, is slightly different.",35142,2
35142,"It's just a tad larger, and when I received it it smelled so bad.",35142,2
35142,"Also, the strap is shorter which I hate.",35142,2
35142,It rests at a really weird height on me whereas the black one is perfect.,35142,2
35142,I don't get it.,35142,2
35143,This didn't work out for me.,35143,2
35143,The top was too small and I will have to send back.,35143,2
35144,"Love the pattern but didn't realize how much smaller these would be than the solid black, navy and blue.",35144,2
35144,I  assume the material is what makes the difference.,35144,2
35144,The solids have a higher percentage of nylon.,35144,2
35145,Wallet is NOT ultra-thin.,35145,2
35145,Wallet is bulky a stiff.,35145,2
35145,"It has a unique fun design but I purchased it because of the ""thin"" design and it has the same bulk as a traditional wallet.",35145,2
35146,Way too small.,35146,2
35146,I ordered xxl,35146,2
35147,"Wanted to love the dress, but it's way to tight across the chest.",35147,2
35147,Ordered a size larger.,35147,2
35147,"Also, very short int the front.",35147,2
35147,Breeze catches you at the wrong time and all the goodies would be out.,35147,2
35147,Hoping a size up will also be a tad longer.,35147,2
35148,"Wore only once and LOVED it until I found out that from sitting down, it tore the seam right where my bum is.",35148,2
35148,"The tear is so long, I was embarrassed to ask how long the tear was present.",35148,2
35148,The tear occurred strictly from sitting down.,35148,2
35149,It's okay for what I paid for it!,35149,2
35149,!,35149,2
35150,Liked the looks of it and was excited to give it to our son with some of his sister's ashes.,35150,2
35150,"However it fell out of my hand to the floor, breaking the welded ring on top.",35150,2
35150,Don't know if it has a warranty or?,35150,2
35151,Very small arrow!,35151,2
35152,stiff and a bit long--not very flattering or comfortable,35152,2
35153,"Okay, here's the weird thing.",35153,2
35153,One of these shoes fit fine in the 4-5 foot my son has.,35153,2
35153,He has very small and narrow feet.,35153,2
35153,"The other shoe was much narrower, even though it said it had the same sizing marker (4-5) on the bottom.",35153,2
35153,So I was left with a pair of shoes where one sides went on and off easily and the other side you had to squeeze on.,35153,2
35153,?,35153,2
35153,????,35153,2
35153,I found a different (and much cheaper) knock-off at Target that fit better and replaced these.,35153,2
35154,"Great style, but the material is cheap and I'm 115 pounds and 5'3 and the small was still big on me",35154,2
35155,"These leggings fit well and are super soft, but look very faded!",35155,2
35155,I washed them once prior to wearing and it was very obvious that they were far more faded than the sweater dress I wore them with.,35155,2
35155,"It looked like they were old and ratty rather than brand new, so that was disappointing.",35155,2
35156,the shoes run small,35156,2
35157,"very cheap material, like old nylon mens underwear...no bueno",35157,2
35158,"Nice earrings but very difficult to get the backs on, they are too short.",35158,2
35159,Go up a size this dress runs small,35159,2
35160,loved the dress but the material is low quality.,35160,2
35160,wore it once and it looks like it's been worn ten times.,35160,2
35161,It's so cute.,35161,2
35161,I wanted to love it.,35161,2
35161,"However, it's way too short through the waist.",35161,2
35161,The length of the legs were good for a wide range of heights (if your height comes from your legs) but the waist length is just too short.,35161,2
35161,I'm 5'4 and I couldn't even get it in my shoulders without it cutting me between the legs.,35161,2
35161,It just does not work and for that I am very sad  ;-),35161,2
35162,I'm mixed.,35162,2
35162,"My son loves these shoes and would like another pair, but they literally lasted for three months before holes showed up at his toes.",35162,2
35162,Within the 1st month the shoe laces began to fray and were unusable.,35162,2
35162,"Everything that makes these shoes light, comfortable and extremely breathable make them flimsy, quick to wear down and easily damaged.",35162,2
35163,Not even close to being a 2XL.,35163,2
35163,Per the size chart that is for a 50-52 inch chest.,35163,2
35163,I could barely get it over my shoulders and my arms were very tight in the sleeves.,35163,2
35163,No way I could wear a suit coat under it.,35163,2
35164,Very pretty but it lost a stone within a week,35164,2
35165,Cute but cheap and tore quickly.,35165,2
35166,"When I purchased this belt it was listed as a full grain leather belt, but when I received it, I wasn't even sure if it was even leather at all.",35166,2
35166,"It may have been bonded leather, but it was definitely NOT full grain leather.",35166,2
35166,"It didn't seem like it would hold up well, but would wear out very quickly with regular use.",35166,2
35166,"The product did arrive in a timely manner, but I will have to keep looking.",35166,2
35166,"It seems impossible to find a durable, true full grain leather belt these days.",35166,2
35166,Very disappointing.,35166,2
35166,I had to send the product back.,35166,2
35167,"I expected them to shrink, and they did a bit, so they fit just a bit big.",35167,2
35167,"Pretty comfy, but almost all came with elastic already unraveling along the waist.",35167,2
35167,"I won't get these again, too shoddy of workmanship.",35167,2
35168,"These pants are more like a medium then a 3 XL, I don't know where they get the sizing info from",35168,2
35169,Fits a young teenager.,35169,2
35169,Would be really nice it larger.,35169,2
35170,This is a fair sweater at best.,35170,2
35170,"First off, beware when you wash it.",35170,2
35170,It comes apart!,35170,2
35170,If you must order this put it in a stocking when you wash it or just let it sit in the sink.,35170,2
35170,Do not swish or squeeze to much it will come apart.,35170,2
35170,"My daughter can fix it, so it now belongs to her.",35170,2
35171,"Reading reviews before I purchased this shirt, ordered large, even though I usually wear medium, but it's way too big.",35171,2
35171,I guess sizing for them isn't consistent since most people complain of being on the smaller side.,35171,2
35171,"For reference,  I'm 5'9"" 180 lbs and most probably the medium would've fit fine, but I guess won't be able to find out since they are out of medium size right now.",35171,2
35171,"Quality wise, it's average to poor even considering the $17 price tag.",35171,2
35171,"Really thin material, almost see thru, that I'm afraid would hold maybe a couple of hand washes.",35171,2
35171,Returning,35171,2
35172,"I liked the non-slip bottoms, but all the toes seemed to be about the same size.",35172,2
35172,"For me, the two small toe sections were incredibly long.",35172,2
35172,That made them not fit as well as I would've liked.,35172,2
35173,Much smaller than I hoped.,35173,2
35173,Chain is so delicate.,35173,2
35173,Sisters probably won't wear often:-(,35173,2
35174,Very simple midi rings.,35174,2
35174,"It took a long time for shipping, in fact, I forgot I ordered them.",35174,2
35174,I lost all the rings in a week.,35174,2
35174,"For the price, it's a great gift or simple accessory.",35174,2
35175,Smelled bad and was too small,35175,2
35176,"That hat is fine but the ""small"" is huge and in fact there is no size printed anywhere on the tag or label.",35176,2
35176,"My hunch is these are all ""one size fits all"" in reality.",35176,2
35176,"I was excited to find a size small listed, but the hat was enormous.",35176,2
35176,Very disappointed and I think it is really false that there are sizes of it at all.,35176,2
35177,"It's super cute, but broke the first time I wore it.",35177,2
35177,"But for the price, what do you expect.",35177,2
35178,"Received the item rather quickly, disappointed in the quality of the fabric and the fit.",35178,2
35178,Though I knew it ran small I ordered a size up and still not close to a good feel.,35178,2
35178,"The material feels cheap and is see through, though it's silk I expected a better quality product.",35178,2
35178,The color in the picture is a charcoal grey once received light grey,35178,2
35179,After I received it I went to go open the bag and the seem in the bag split not happy,35179,2
35180,This hoodie is not worth the money that is asked for it.,35180,2
35180,"Unfortunately, the ""cotton"" material that it's made out of is super thin and just not as nicely made as I thought it may be.....I will be more careful when buying products from another country.",35180,2
35181,Not as expected quality no good,35181,2
35182,"Item is too small, when the size states one size fits all.",35182,2
35182,ITEM IS NOT TRUE TO ITS SIZE...FAIR WARNING!!,35182,2
35182,!,35182,2
35183,Outfit didn't last long,35183,2
35184,I loved this bag when I first got it -- but after about 6 months the main zipper broke.,35184,2
35184,"It's a really nice-looking, comfortable, useful  bag -- I thought it was perfect until the zipper broke.",35184,2
35184,"I know I could find someone to repair the zipper -- I tried various ways to fix it, myself -- but I don't want to have to do that.",35184,2
35184,"But then again, for such an inexpensive bag ... you get what you pay for.",35184,2
35184,I would have gladly paid much more -- three or four times as much -- for a bag of better quality.,35184,2
35184,Soooo disappointed ....,35184,2
35185,So wide I could fit 3 of me in it.,35185,2
35186,This sweater does not fit like the picture.,35186,2
35186,The sweater isn't as chunky and think as the pic.,35186,2
35186,The sleeves are definitely shorter than the pic (3/4 sleeve or shorter and I am not a tall person at 5'3).,35186,2
35186,I don't think a larger size would have made any difference other than fitting funny in other areas.,35186,2
35186,"Too expensive to return over seas, so it's in the to go pile.",35186,2
35187,The picture made it look so much nicer than it really is.,35187,2
35187,I was very excited for it but kind of disappointed when I actually got it.,35187,2
35187,It does look cheap.,35187,2
35188,"I don't typically write reviews, but once I received the product I realized the picture was fotoshoped as I actually own the original suit from ""Garota Fit"" purchased in Brazil.",35188,2
35188,Notice they cut the Girls face from the picture and her leg warmers do not match the other suits.,35188,2
35188,No original propaganda would do that.,35188,2
35188,"Thw suit:
The material from this suit is so thin and the fit is completelly off, totally diferent from my original suit.",35188,2
35188,Don't get your hopes up.,35188,2
35188,It is very cheaply made and the suit on picture is not the one you will receive.,35188,2
35189,My granddaughter is 11 months old and I bought these pants in an 18 months old size.,35189,2
35189,My granddaughter is not your typical skinny baby.,35189,2
35189,She is chunky like a cherub angel.,35189,2
35189,When she sits in these pants the fabric creases into her baby fat and looks really uncomfortable.,35189,2
35189,I think the fabric these are made of is not very room so I would warn against purchasing these if you have a think legged baby.,35189,2
35189,We have other pants here that are 18 month old size and don't do this to her legs.,35189,2
35189,I'm thinking those might have more cotton in them.,35189,2
35189,I'm not sure what these pants are made out of.,35189,2
35190,Orange TOO loud!,35190,2
35191,Received in a plastic baggie with no Kendra Scott turquoise bag.,35191,2
35191,Not sure if it is fake or not.,35191,2
35191,Not happy.,35191,2
35192,If you have big boobs it will not fit because it did not come with string to hold boobs up.,35192,2
35193,I have a pretty small head and even this was too small,35193,2
35194,not what i expected.,35194,2
35194,the quality is poor.,35194,2
35195,This too big and the threads came off on the bottom edge,35195,2
35196,I got a XL and it fits like a Medium.,35196,2
35196,At least the top didn't cost much because returning it would about as much as the original purchase.,35196,2
35196,"Lesson learned, I guess.",35196,2
35196,:(,35196,2
35197,"The shirts well made, but they run very small.",35197,2
35198,Nice looking suit BUT size listing on website don't reflect  clothing sizes.,35198,2
35198,Too large.,35198,2
35199,The reason I only gave it 2stars is that I can pull out the second stem without a pliers to change time and poorly made watch band that won't fasten properly.,35199,2
35199,It's hard to tell the time because the screens have an awful glare.,35199,2
35200,way too small and flimsyb,35200,2
35201,"Pretty cheap, broke within an hour of putting them on.",35201,2
35202,I'm not sure what's going on with this top.,35202,2
35202,It's too long and baggy in the shoulders - and I have broad shoulders.,35202,2
35202,It's just odd so I'm returning it.,35202,2
35203,Got this shirt sooner than anticipated but was disappointed to see how tiny it was.,35203,2
35203,I ordered a large and received what looks like a size small or a large if it were meant for children 12 years old.,35203,2
35203,Even my shirts from Forever 21 that are a size Large are bigger than this and anyone who has shopped from this brand knows how small their sizes run.,35203,2
35203,If you are going to order this get 2 or 3 sizes up unless you are shopping for a 12 year old girl.,35203,2
35204,"was torn on one side where it was never sewn together, had to do it myself.",35204,2
35204,The bust size was to small,35204,2
35205,It is ok.,35205,2
35205,It is not as Posh as I had imagined from the picture.,35205,2
35206,"I want to love the necklace, but it has a horrible smell.",35206,2
35206,"I've soaked it in jewelry cleaner, rubbing alcohol, regular alcohol, etc., but it still has a smell that's almost unbearable.",35206,2
35207,the picture makes this look like it's high quality but it's really just a picture pasted on a pendent with a dome glued over it.,35207,2
35207,I would have made this myself had I know what it really was.,35207,2
35207,"Glad it was so inexpensive, but still don't waste your money.",35207,2
35208,Way too long and loose,35208,2
35209,If you're a tall gal then its not for you.,35209,2
35210,My son wears 24 mo and some 18 mo.,35210,2
35210,"clothing, but these 2T/3T were very small.",35210,2
35210,"The leg holes were so tight, I felt bad putting them on him.",35210,2
35211,Super cute great colors but too small.,35211,2
35211,"I am 5'7"" 124lbs and the bottoms won't even go up my leg and the top won't even close on my back ...",35211,2
35211,The material isn't even long or big enough for the ends to touch each other on my back.,35211,2
35212,"Nice enough for cosplay, but a I was more than a bit disappointed by this item.",35212,2
35212,"It's extremely thin, more of a wafer than a coin,and the design it more of a shallow stamp then a carving or embossment.",35212,2
35212,Would not pay this much for it again.,35212,2
35213,"Wasn't made from cotton, was more of a wind breaker material so there was no wiggle room whatsoever.",35213,2
35213,I ordered a size 10 but the waist liked more like a 6.,35213,2
35213,The stitching was already coming loose as well.,35213,2
35213,Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it came in on time and they refunded me in a timely manner.,35213,2
35214,It's a great product.,35214,2
35214,My problem is the fact I orderd two and revived only one.,35214,2
35215,Look more like a light blue than grey.,35215,2
35216,The underwear doesn't fit snugly around the base of the shaft.,35216,2
35216,Doesn't look attractive.,35216,2
35217,see through.,35217,2
35218,Business Cards have to be trimmed to fit into this wallet.,35218,2
35218,Barely fits driver's license--you have to really shove it in there.,35218,2
35218,"Very heavy and too small, tight compartments.",35218,2
35218,Overpriced for what you get.,35218,2
35218,I am going to use it but I will not be buying this again and would not recommend it.,35218,2
35219,I got this shirt as a medium in white.,35219,2
35219,"I am 5'5"" and 125 lbs and the shirt fit...okay.",35219,2
35219,It's not awful but the material was very cheap and see through.,35219,2
35219,I am kinda disappointed with this purchase.,35219,2
35219,I was really excited about the prospect of a v-neck crop top but it really isn't worth the price.,35219,2
35220,Suit was good.,35220,2
35220,"I thought it was Prime, but came on a slow boat from china.",35220,2
35220,good quality and color selection was good.,35220,2
35220,Just so slow delivery after ordering .,35220,2
35221,"Overall, the product was awesome but extremely disappointed because product was extremely small and not at all the size being advertised.",35221,2
35222,Black suede like fuzz is coming off the surface so that you see the cloth underneath which is a lighter color.,35222,2
35222,This after one wearing.,35222,2
35223,Doesn't fit as expected,35223,2
35224,"Too small on my shoulders, even when I ordered a larger size!",35224,2
35225,Didn't like at all and was too small by at least two sizes,35225,2
35226,the purse is ok not to impressed its very big  very stiff hoping it will break in over time.,35226,2
35227,Gorgeous but they don't fit my ears,35227,2
35228,The dress looks uneven from front to back  and to large in bust area.,35228,2
35228,Giving it away to someone else who may need it that may want to alter .,35228,2
35228,:(,35228,2
35229,True to size but I didn't like the cotton against the lace.,35229,2
35229,It was neither dressy nor casual..just kinda cheep looking.,35229,2
35230,The batteries died prematurely.,35230,2
35231,It was way too small.,35231,2
35231,I think it might have been too short as well.,35231,2
35232,"Not great  socks, pay more for better ones...",35232,2
35233,my opinion is that it runs too big.,35233,2
35233,i bought an extra small and it didn't fit.,35233,2
35233,the bottoms of the bathing suit didn't match the top and the top was wide.,35233,2
35234,I received the wrong size!!,35234,2
35234,The gauges are nice but someone over there isn't doing their job right.,35234,2
35234,I ordered 00g and received 0 gauges ..,35234,2
35234,I took a picture with the gauge I received with a pencil to show the size..,35234,2
35234,"The only good thing was, that delivery was super fast",35234,2
35235,I got these for my septum and it's nearly impossible to push the end piece into the post while it's in my nose.,35235,2
35235,"I just wear an o-ring on the end to keep it in, it saves me a severe headache.",35235,2
35235,"I find these comfortable enough, I did have to trim them because they were so long.",35235,2
35235,These are okay but if you're getting it for a septum piercing I would consider a septum bullet instead (unless you have some o-rings handy to stick on the end),35235,2
35236,not so great.,35236,2
35236,returning.,35236,2
35236,doesnt flow nicely.,35236,2
35236,gives a babydoll look.,35236,2
35236,maybe i'm too curvy for it.,35236,2
35237,color was not what i expected.,35237,2
35237,too pale in color of what was expected.,35237,2
35238,Very unforgiving cut and material!,35238,2
35239,The buttons ripped the first time I tried unsnapping them to change my sons diaper.,35239,2
35240,"I returned it - looks like a dress, not a swimsuit",35240,2
35241,Looked very cute but the fit was way off.,35241,2
35241,"Additionally, the white was very see-through so I'm sure once it gets wet it would just highlight any bumps or bubbles.",35241,2
35242,This shirt fits like it's plus sized because it's abnormally wide for a medium I don't think my customers would like this and I'm ALL into pleasing my customers at my stores.,35242,2
35242,I gave it two stars because it came a tad bit early.,35242,2
35243,the zipper isn't very sturdy; mine broke after about 2 months.,35243,2
35244,I was so disappointed when I opened the package.,35244,2
35244,The color is completely different than pictured.,35244,2
35244,I mean the flower is a neon pink!,35244,2
35244,It doesn't match any of the outfits I was planning to put it with.,35244,2
35244,I will be returning.,35244,2
35245,"2 pack, and 1 arrived broken off the post.",35245,2
35246,"Will serve its intended purpose, but it is overpriced at $9.99.",35246,2
35247,These shirts feel as though they are on backwards.,35247,2
35247,They just aren't cut right in the shoulders.,35247,2
35248,see through completely.,35248,2
35248,terrible material.,35248,2
35248,needed to buy 2 of them to fix the dress,35248,2
35249,"sizes runs small, fit like a crop top rather than a t shirt",35249,2
35250,You can't tell from the pic or description but this has cups and a separate section for breasts.,35250,2
35250,"If you are large chested, the elastic from the separate sectioning will cut you across your breasts.",35250,2
35250,Ouch.,35250,2
35250,Another item that came while we were out of town and can't be returned because the window is closed by 3 days.,35250,2
35251,I don't like it.,35251,2
35252,"The ear mitts are a great idea, but only one fits my right ear.",35252,2
35252,"The other one is apparently too large for my left ear and doesn't stay tight enough and falls off, no matter what I have tried.",35252,2
35252,The right one is fine!,35252,2
35253,"If you have large breasts, pass this shirt on, it will not be flattering.",35253,2
35253,"I have C cups and this shirt rode up too high, revealing my hips on the sides.",35253,2
35253,"With the string belt, which is removable, the faux waist is very unflattering and looks more like a maternity shirt.",35253,2
35254,I need to return the size was small.,35254,2
35255,"It felt all bunched up in the hip area where it had obviously been taken in and that, in turn, made the gathering in front and the hemline crooked.",35255,2
35255,It was a very heavy dress also.,35255,2
35256,It is pretty but short waisted.,35256,2
35256,"I am only 5'5""and it is way too short like a crop top.",35256,2
35256,May be great if you are petite but order 2 sizes bigger.,35256,2
35256,An xl fit except for length and I am a medium US size.,35256,2
35256,I am returning it.,35256,2
35257,"The pattern was too big and seemed ""old ladyish"" when I tried it on.",35257,2
35257,I returned this one.,35257,2
35257,The sizing also seemed to run a little small as well.,35257,2
35258,Way to big.,35258,2
35258,Be a few years before my kids fit in them,35258,2
35259,"This product is very cheap looking, definitely not a event/club attire.",35259,2
35259,No support with elastic and bigger than normal.,35259,2
35259,I am 5'5 180lb 36c/d ordered a medium according to the reviews and the bottom was too big the top fits a little small.,35259,2
35259,Picture is a little misleading.,35259,2
35259,Save yourself the money unless you plan on wearing this around the house.,35259,2
35259,Had high hopes based on the reviews.,35259,2
35260,"it's too small, cut small",35260,2
35261,Way smaller than expected- was so surprised I even double checked the tag to make sure they didn't send the right size.,35261,2
35261,Also- it smells!,35261,2
35261,Very pronounced chemical odor.,35261,2
35261,Will be returning this!,35261,2
35262,Bought a half size bigger than I need and still tight.,35262,2
35262,Very disappointed.,35262,2
35263,"the chain was broken in 3 different pieces, & the loop on the pendant is so small i don't think i can put another chain on it",35263,2
35264,Dod not recommend it magnet not strong it will only hold 5 bills if lucky,35264,2
35265,"These did not fit the size chart at all - they are very thin fabric, with a bit of give, but they definitely don't fit.",35265,2
35266,Purchased for my mother in law and they didn't fit.,35266,2
35266,Cheaply made.,35266,2
35267,"Dress has gold buttons, not silver as seen in the picture.",35267,2
35267,Fabric is kind of thin.,35267,2
35267,Returning .,35267,2
35268,Very cheap material.,35268,2
35268,Ripped the first day.,35268,2
35269,"Contrary to the product photo and the other posts, my wig arrived completely fallen.",35269,2
35269,I chose this wig because others said it held its shape through two events or at least through one evening (which was all I needed it for).,35269,2
35269,"After using half a can of max-hold hairspray, shaping it into a point and hanging it upside-down for two nights, it was okay for the few hours I needed it.",35269,2
35269,I would have returned it but didn't have time to find an alternate and now it's plastered with hairspray.,35269,2
35269,"The color is great and the fit was really good, but the shape was not what I expected.",35269,2
35269,I hope mine was the exception and everyone else has a better experience.,35269,2
35270,Too small,35270,2
35271,small and very cheap.,35271,2
35271,fabric cheap and stitching cheap.,35271,2
35272,I never have a problem with adjusted size hats but I did with this the smallest I can adjust and the material is very cheap,35272,2
35273,I wanted so much for this bathing suit to work.,35273,2
35273,"I'm 5'8, 36c, and wear a size 8/10 usually.",35273,2
35273,"Generally i would get a large, but I opted for an extra large for this product.",35273,2
35273,"The material is good, and no issues at all with the bathing suit being to tight causing the ""sausage effect"".",35273,2
35273,"The reason I give it two stars however, is the fact that it is extremely short for someone that is my height.",35273,2
35273,"I'm not conservative when it comes to my backside showing, which it does in this.",35273,2
35273,"My issue is that in order for my top to reach the bra inside the suit, I have to hike it up so high which causes one of the worst cases of camel toe.",35273,2
35273,Also the straps aren't the most comfortable when I'm trying to balance out what exactly is showing.,35273,2
35273,This suit will definitely work for someone who is shorter and smaller chested.,35273,2
35274,Cheap material,35274,2
35275,I wear a XXL everything and this vest wasn't remotely close to fitting me.,35275,2
35275,I gave it to my son who wears a large and it fit him perfect.,35275,2
35275,"If your a 2X, try a 4X or 5X if you can get one that size.",35275,2
35275,Looks great though.,35275,2
35276,Love the outfit but i ordered a size 3-6 months and the size i got is for a 3 year old,35276,2
35277,"The product description is not correct, this is not a boat neck shirt.",35277,2
35277,It's a scoop neck.,35277,2
35277,"The teal color is really pretty and the material is really nice and soft though, so I'm keeping it for layering.",35277,2
35277,The drape isn't like in the picture either.,35277,2
35277,"It is form fitting rather than having a flow around the waistline as depicted in the picture, or maybe I should have ordered a larger size.",35277,2
35277,I normally wear a women's size XL.,35277,2
35277,I ordered a 2XL and it was still snug.,35277,2
35277,"I wouldn't call this a tunic either, it isn't nearly long enough to be classified as a tunic.",35277,2
35277,"I also ordered one in black, but what came was a black, uneven hem, short sleeve shirt.",35277,2
35277,"The packaging was the same as the teal, but a totally different style shirt was in it.",35277,2
35277,That was weird.,35277,2
35278,Fits as expected and super cute.,35278,2
35278,"Looks better in real life than the picture, but fell apart after the second wash",35278,2
35279,"Very limp, falls in a lot.",35279,2
35279,+Too many pockets.,35279,2
35279,Can't find anything.,35279,2
35279,2 stars for early arrival and it is as pictured.,35279,2
35279,Just wish it was sturdier.,35279,2
35280,Fabric is super thin not what I expected,35280,2
35281,It's to small for me,35281,2
35282,"Liked the colors and patterns on it, but runs very small and the cups are to large also the metal under wire on the cups was popping on the left side one..",35282,2
35282,Perfect if your petit and have large breast.,35282,2
35283,On the model it looks like it flows around your curves.,35283,2
35283,In reality it is about as wide as it is long (or so it seemed to me when I tried it on).,35283,2
35283,This might be ok if you are a cube masquerading as an adult female homo sapiens .,35283,2
35283,it did not look ok on my hourglass-leaning-toward-pear figure.,35283,2
35283,"Also the neck opening becomes a slit, not a V, when you try it on.",35283,2
35283,I give two stars because I can imagine that maybe *someone* might have a body this works for .,35283,2
35283,"After all, I think Earth's population just hit 7 billion.",35283,2
35283,And the stitching seemed ok.,35283,2
35284,Thought  I was getting a Browning sweatshirt but infact it was a gildan screen print shirt but it was true to the size,35284,2
35285,"larger than I realized & not blue
they are a nice item",35285,2
35286,"This is a cute romper, especially for the price but there are several ""red flags"" to be aware of.",35286,2
35286,"First of all, I ordered a Large.",35286,2
35286,It does say that the item runs small for US sizes.,35286,2
35286,"(Well, fix the sizing on the ad posting and you'll save everyone time and aggravation!)",35286,2
35286,"They did not have an X Large, so I thought I'd get the Large and take a 50/50 chance it would fit.",35286,2
35286,I gained weight (23lbs) for the first time in my life so I'm determined not to buy anything but a few things for a trip in a month.,35286,2
35286,"Anyway, I am 5'31/2"", weigh roughly 155lbs.",35286,2
35286,"I have always had large breasts (I'm a 36 DD-36 DDD now, when I weighed around 128-135 I was a Size 32-34 D), have small hips and thin legs but carry extra weight in my mid section.",35286,2
35286,I couldn't get the romper over my thighs.,35286,2
35286,So you get the idea.,35286,2
35286,The Large isn't even close to a US Large.,35286,2
35286,"Second flag, the fabric is sheer.",35286,2
35286,You will definately be able to see ur bra and panties.,35286,2
35286,"The front is a V, completely open, (kind of like an opening u would get from a wrap around dress that's cut to low), so regardless of your size, you will either completely show your bra, (larger chests will ""push"" out the opening even more), will have to wear something under it (will look awful with this style), or pin it which you ll def see and will mostly still be open.",35286,2
35286,"The print on the fabric is okay, nothing special.",35286,2
35287,It's cute but WAY too short.,35287,2
35287,It's not t-shirt material at all is more silk.,35287,2
35287,The fabric bunches above the tie making you have to consistently pull it down or your lady parts will show,35287,2
35288,Too small.,35288,2
35288,the sizing does not correspond to the actual size.,35288,2
35289,Does not look like the picture.,35289,2
35289,Not what I expected.,35289,2
35289,Doesn't fit well.,35289,2
35289,Almost have to wear something underneath.,35289,2
35290,Love the bag but it doesn't stay this tall as the picture shows it flops over if you don't have tall item in the bag it just fold over.,35290,2
35290,Material is great and color,35290,2
35291,I am an average size and the sleeves fit like they are three quarter.,35291,2
35291,Fits loose for an Asian person or petite frame.,35291,2
35291,Not worth $25 at all.,35291,2
35291,Very disappointed.,35291,2
35291,"When you want to return it, they send you a label but going to cost more than half of what I paid.",35291,2
35291,Lesson learned for me not to ever order an item from amazon that is out of the country.,35291,2
35292,This runs very small.,35292,2
35292,"My petite size 0/2 14 year old daughter order a small but even that was on the small side, especially the top.",35292,2
35292,The bottoms are thankfully not the neoprene style but are very thin and I imagine too thin once wet.,35292,2
35292,"The top is heavily padded on the bottom part for ""lift"".",35292,2
35292,It's going back.,35292,2
35293,Disappointed this came straight from China and was probably a knock off of someone's original design.,35293,2
35293,They also have no idea how to label things.,35293,2
35293,It says it's 100% cotton which it certainly is not as it's very stretchy and has a polyester-like feel.,35293,2
35293,They also claim that you can only dry clean but it certainly can be run through on any cycle and not be effected.,35293,2
35293,I just get the feeling that this is not an honest seller I should be buying from.,35293,2
35293,I much prefer things to ship from the US and not take weeks to arrive also.,35293,2
35294,Cheap material and fits bigger than I thought!,35294,2
35294,Hubby usually wears a large yet it fits like an extra large!,35294,2
35294,Longer sleeves too.,35294,2
35295,color was not as it appeared online and was not very flattering to wear.,35295,2
35296,Company was great to work with but sizes were way too small...,35296,2
35296,The medium was just like an XL,35296,2
35297,"Size runs small and is not very stretchy, recommend buying different brand or buy in one size bigger than what you usually wear",35297,2
35298,Cheap fabric.,35298,2
35298,"The shirt was waaaay too small and showed my under boob, not the look I was looking for.",35298,2
35299,Sorry but hat soon spit at seam.,35299,2
35299,Good hate were this not the case.,35299,2
35300,The garment smelled so bad I could not even try it on until I washed it.,35300,2
35300,I know that is crazy but I knew it would fit so I threw it in the wash.,35300,2
35300,"Following the drying instructions (still smelled) I hung it up to air dry and now two days later, I am not sure I can put it on it still smells.",35300,2
35301,About half of card slots will not accept any cards making rhem unusable.,35301,2
35302,I bought a XXL size after following advice on other reviews.,35302,2
35302,"As a reference, I generally fit comfortably in size 10 clothes and bathing suits, and can sometimes wear an 8.",35302,2
35302,This thing was still too small!,35302,2
35302,It barely covered my rear and was too tight up top (and I'm not well endowed up top)  I will be returning this item.,35302,2
35302,I gave it 2 stars because it seemed well made.,35302,2
35303,I used these for my newborn the first month or two of her life.,35303,2
35303,"After them being on her head for about thirty minutes, they  completely stretch out and don't stay on.",35303,2
35303,The size is weird.,35303,2
35303,Length-wise they are a bit short and width-wise they are big after being stretched out.,35303,2
35303,I wouldn't buy anymore.,35303,2
35304,Eh it's super cute but fits got a size 3x fits like a xl and the free gift is cool but the chain,35304,2
35305,Dress does not fit as expected and gapes.,35305,2
35305,Fabric is beautiful so I'll make it into a skirt.,35305,2
35306,Nice material though,35306,2
35307,Fit bad.,35307,2
35307,No support with the top so there was nothing holding my boobs in at the bottom.lol,35307,2
35308,Very tight fitting and you can see through the fabric to the band of my maternity jeans.,35308,2
35308,Will be returning.,35308,2
35308,"The color is nice, but that is about all I like about it.",35308,2
35309,This looked really weird when I put it on.,35309,2
35309,It's a kind of stretchy cotton shell with the chiffon type fabric in the front.,35309,2
35309,"It's hard to explain, but the look and fit are just strange.",35309,2
35309,I'm returning.,35309,2
35310,The time Turner necklace was just as nice as the other ones i've seen but the snitch has an ugly yellowish bead that is not at all metallic and doesnt match anything else so I will not be wearing it.,35310,2
35310,The bracelet broke the first day and I could fix the link with a stronger one but it was a little large and I'm not tiny either.,35310,2
35311,Their sizes run very small.,35311,2
35312,Really cute.,35312,2
35312,"It says one size, but it really means one small size.",35312,2
35312,It fits my size 2-4 daughter.,35312,2
35312,"Not me, I'm a 10 -12.",35312,2
35312,"Wish it fit, it's really cute.",35312,2
35313,I can't fit this outfit and the strings were missing for me to even wear it.,35313,2
35313,I could only try it on.,35313,2
35314,"They're scratchy, the stitching feels odd, and the waist bad goes up way to high an cuts my midsection in half.",35314,2
35314,"If I try And put the waist band lower, I have a saggy crotch.",35314,2
35314,"(Lol gross,  no one wants that!)",35314,2
35314,"I really want to love these, but somethings just aren't meant to be.",35314,2
35314,"I will say, they are cute, and the pockets are great.",35314,2
35314,Just scratchy.,35314,2
35315,I ordered a size 3x-they are more like a L/XL.,35315,2
35315,The color was as pictured-just WAY to small for me to wear.,35315,2
35315,And they did not have hardly any stretch.,35315,2
35315,Ended up finding a pair at Wal-Mart.,35315,2
35316,"Had to send back, could not open it without struggling.",35316,2
35317,"The band fit as expected, but the cups were way smaller than they should be for a size large.",35317,2
35317,Straps were wide set and the plastic adjusting pieces on the straps cut into my flesh.,35317,2
35317,Completely un-wearable to me.,35317,2
35318,To small,35318,2
35319,Over priced at best these are a $12.99 pair of underwear..,35319,2
35320,The wire chain is quite small and the earring are a bit too heavy for my ears.,35320,2
35320,I do use the pretty charm on another chain.,35320,2
35321,"This is a very basic bag, very lightweight, absolutely will not pass for leather.",35321,2
35321,I wouldnt use this as my daily purse.,35321,2
35321,The design is nice- and it'll work for me as a beach bag.,35321,2
35321,"Something I won't be bummed if its stolen, something I won't be bummed out about if my sunblock explodes-and will fit a thin beach towel or a few pieces of clothing.",35321,2
35321,"Stitching could be better, as you can see in one of my pictures, if you pull gently, as a too full bag might, you can see the stitching isn't reinforced and would likely rip if packed heavy or tight.",35321,2
35321,"Looks cheap, feels cheap, but smart structure with the pockets to keep key items easily accessible and I like the top zip, often missing on similar shape\quality bags.",35321,2
35321,Would be easy to brush off dirt/sand.,35321,2
35321,"I recieved a sample in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.",35321,2
35321,Obviously I don't promise a positive review.,35321,2
35322,This is the size of a small picnic blanket and the weaving is so loose it's already coming unraveled.,35322,2
35323,"For others, I dipped in a sink of cool water and hung them up in a shower until damp, then put them on and stretched them somewhat.",35323,2
35324,"doesn't look like the picture, didn't like it.",35324,2
35325,I bought this for my husbands Birthday.,35325,2
35325,"He loved it at first, but it only took a week for the links to start falling apart.",35325,2
35325,"The watch is beautiful, but it cost way too much for it to be falling apart.",35325,2
35325,I would not recommend this watch.,35325,2
35326,It looks way longer than it is.,35326,2
35327,Nothing special at all and fits very tight,35327,2
35328,"Sent back, to small and surprisingly short.",35328,2
35328,"I felt like I had put on a belly shirt, and to me the picture looks like it would be longer, and flowy-ier.",35328,2
35329,Cute but the xl was more like a small or a medium.,35329,2
35329,Gave it to my teenaged step daughter who wears a s-m. She likes it.,35329,2
35330,not the one i wanted,35330,2
35331,Nice but never got the small bag,35331,2
35332,I really didn't like the feel of the fabric.,35332,2
35332,Fells really synthetic and itchy.,35332,2
35333,"The size of the bag was as expected, but the fabric looks cheap and the navy colour is too pale",35333,2
35334,too small,35334,2
35335,Used them once and the lenses have already popped out.,35335,2
35336,It ripped two days later,35336,2
35337,"Not even close to what the photo makes it out to be,",35337,2
35338,"The dress, should actually be a shirt.",35338,2
35338,"The dress/ shirt is very short, you can see through the material, very thin material, I was going to wear leggings under the dress/ shirt.",35338,2
35338,"The chest area was very tight, you will have to be smaller chested to wear the dress/shirt.",35338,2
35339,small  my daughter ended up with it,35339,2
35340,no stretch to the top and the colors are off its almost cute... almost.,35340,2
35341,The fabric is really thin and clingy.,35341,2
35342,Runs extremely small.,35342,2
35342,"I'm short (5'2"") with a short torso but the length was short.",35342,2
35342,The top coverage over the breast is sparse (I'm a full b/small c).,35342,2
35342,I was popping out all over.,35342,2
35342,Material was nice and looks match the photo.,35342,2
35342,I bought both a small (my typical size) and a medium and both were too small.,35342,2
35343,"Huge, sizing not accurate.",35343,2
35344,"I wouldn't describe this as outerwear....its more of a sweater weight, or maybe a suit jacket.",35344,2
35344,Still cute but not good for warmth.,35344,2
35344,"It did not come with the belt, although there are belt loops, so that is very misleading.",35344,2
35344,All of the reviews that I read said this runs small so I ordered a large but it was WAY too big.,35344,2
35344,I don't even think a medium would have been right.,35344,2
35344,Returning =(,35344,2
35345,Poorly made and does not fit well no matter what size you order!,35345,2
35346,Too small,35346,2
35347,It fit OK.,35347,2
35347,"However, at the first wash in the delicate cycle, they pilled everywhere.",35347,2
35347,And after the 2nd wash I threw them out.,35347,2
35348,2 stars why cause one the shirt looks nice in person but  couldn't even get it on.,35348,2
35348,Dislike that to.,35348,2
35349,"While this choker looks beautiful in the pictures, it doesn't work in reality.",35349,2
35349,The multi strap design is lost as the straps are difficult to separate and do not stay that way.,35349,2
35349,"You end up with a bulky, strange looking choker.",35349,2
35349,I wish that I had chosen a different design for myself.,35349,2
35349,"No, I would not recommend this to a friend.",35349,2
35350,The fit was as expected.,35350,2
35350,I did order a couple sizes larger for the proper fit.,35350,2
35350,"I loved the print of the top, it was beautiful.",35350,2
35350,I absolutely hated the material.,35350,2
35350,The cotton blend was not at all as expected.,35350,2
35350,Very stretchy.,35350,2
35350,Felt more like a polyester and spandex blend rather than cotton.,35350,2
35350,It was light weight and breathable but the fabric felt more like that of a workout top.,35350,2
35351,fit as expected but two of the straps were already broken by the time I got them :(,35351,2
35352,did not like the fit,35352,2
35353,cute but waay too small.,35353,2
35353,made for someone with nothing up top,35353,2
35354,"These are much thinner material than I had expected, so I don't know if I'll ever wear them.",35354,2
35354,"They also have an extremely strong chemical odor, even after washing twice and having been out of the package for quite a while.",35354,2
35355,It shrunk alot- so much so that I can't wear it any longer.,35355,2
35356,The fabric and size were not as expected.,35356,2
35357,Too small biased on size chart for me,35357,2
35358,The shirt was short so I won't wear it.,35358,2
35358,Otherwise cute.,35358,2
35359,Have purchased before and size 7 fit perfect.,35359,2
35359,This time I ordered the same size 7 and they were way to small.,35359,2
35359,Disappointed!,35359,2
35360,The top is cute but the bottoms are awful.,35360,2
35360,They don't look like the picture and they are entirely too small.,35360,2
35360,I ordered a large and it runs small but still fits (38c) overall I will throw out the bottoms but use the top.,35360,2
35361,stitching was weird,35361,2
35362,"Love the print, but the sizing is all wrong.",35362,2
35362,The top fits like an XL and the bottom fits like a S. If they were more closely matched I would love this.,35362,2
35363,"came with a strap damaged, so I had to return",35363,2
35364,Very weird material; not a soft cotton.,35364,2
35364,Returned.,35364,2
35365,Only one side of the necklace has detailing.,35365,2
35365,the other side has some random markings on it.,35365,2
35366,Not very comfortable I returned them.,35366,2
35366,Expensive for what they are,35366,2
35367,Diamond in the middle is very cheap and possibly might fall out.,35367,2
35367,Both earrings were slightly bent.,35367,2
35368,See through and looked like a weird 70s outfit.,35368,2
35368,Not my style!,35368,2
35369,"They're much bigger than the Rayban 55mm Aviators, so I returned them right away.",35369,2
35370,Does not fit well ...if prime i would have returned it (two stars for fabric softness and color),35370,2
35371,Looks like a Halloween custome.,35371,2
35372,In a 2 these are small and humongous,35372,2
35373,The product is described as sunglasses and even goes so far as to say that the lens is resin.,35373,2
35373,There are NO lenses in these sunglasses - just empty space.,35373,2
35373,"If you're looking for sunglasses, these are not it.",35373,2
35373,It's a shame because the frame is cute.,35373,2
35374,"Shipping timely, material somewhat cheap and scratching.",35374,2
35374,Nice flow.,35374,2
35374,Very basic dress.,35374,2
35375,The t-shirt was too large usually i think is larger than a usual extra-large.,35375,2
35376,so small,35376,2
35377,The earrings were not as colorful as shown.,35377,2
35377,But they will do.,35377,2
35378,Looks like a bobby  hat (British police) it is very hard felt.,35378,2
35378,It just looks.. weird.,35378,2
35378,Like a helmet,35378,2
35379,"Overall: made with very inexpensive materials, but price mitigates any major complaints.",35379,2
35379,"Pros:
Price
Good costume or one time use

Cons:
Paint chips, plastic chain tarnished after almost a week.",35379,2
35380,Product was cute but sizing not accurate.,35380,2
35380,Runs extremely small.,35380,2
35380,My size is US 8-10 i ordered 3XL but its too small for me.,35380,2
35380,disappointing :(,35380,2
35381,I ended up returning this dress because the material was very cheap.,35381,2
35381,It seemed like something you would get from one of those fake Instagram boutiques.,35381,2
35382,Nice tie quality not great,35382,2
35383,"5'4"", 140 pounds.",35383,2
35383,I got into these but they were a little tight.,35383,2
35383,"Also, they are a little see through, though you'd be okay with a long shirt.",35383,2
35383,"Finally, the product doesn't match the picture.",35383,2
35383,"The ratio of stars to stripes is bigger, ie: one leg isn't all stars like the image suggests.",35383,2
35383,(I also bought two other versions of the same legging.,35383,2
35383,These are all the same product with a different name.,35383,2
35383,I returned them all.),35383,2
35384,"The outfit was the quality I expected for the price, and looked cute for the event my children wore it for.",35384,2
35384,"However I had to have the elastic taken out of the waistbands, and alter the suspender straps..",35384,2
35384,"It is a ""long and skinny"" style fit.",35384,2
35385,"The lights on this case are yellow, not white .",35385,2
35385,I got this case yesterday and it came with three missing lights.,35385,2
35385,I want to return this and get another one because it's not what I expected it to be,35385,2
35386,Not as i expected dress does not mach picture,35386,2
35387,bad lens,35387,2
35388,It does not look like the picture.,35388,2
35388,It has a boxy look to it.,35388,2
35389,"A lot narrower than pictured, if you like narrow ties you will be happy.",35389,2
35390,Turns color in about a month of normal Waring..should cost less.,35390,2
35391,The breast area did not fit at all.,35391,2
35391,"I wear a 34 C and it was hanging off my body, even with a bra underneath.",35391,2
35391,"Also, the skirt portion was very long.",35391,2
35391,"Definitely not for a short person, even with heels.",35391,2
35392,Very low quality product.,35392,2
35393,too short,35393,2
35394,Needs more Velcro closures.,35394,2
35395,The problem was not with the vendor...I've worn the Polo line off and on for years but this particular sweater wouldn't fit a young teenager much less a six foot 200 pound man.,35395,2
35396,The quality o the fabric is so cheap..,35396,2
35396,I was really disappointed.,35396,2
35397,These shoes fit really weird unfortunately.,35397,2
35397,"Our son has a wide foot so I thought they would fit really well, but when I put them on him, they seem to fit almost diagonally.",35397,2
35397,"Due to this issue, he has not been able to wear them at all.",35397,2
35397,This makes me terribly sad because they look very cute and well made.,35397,2
35398,"Eh, i sent it back, it just didn't feel cool or fun.",35398,2
35398,Just a flattering dress that in some way could resemble a chewbacca costume.,35398,2
35398,Kind of basic,35398,2
35399,Cute but way too small.,35399,2
35399,I got a large but it fits more like a small/medium.,35399,2
35399,Size up,35399,2
35400,It was too large.,35400,2
35401,Very wierd material.,35401,2
35401,Cute.,35401,2
35401,But will never wear.,35401,2
35401,Its boxy and just weird,35401,2
35402,Fits very smal.,35402,2
35402,Poor qulaity fabric.,35402,2
35403,I took a chance on these because I had purchased a similar looking pair from another vendor on Amazon and absolutely loved them.,35403,2
35403,"I read the reviews for this product that said that they ran small, but they looked so much like the other pair I purchased (which are very stretchy and made from a thicker, opaque material) that I thought it might be ok. Wrong... so wrong.",35403,2
35403,"I wear a size 8/10 and while I could get them on, the fabric (which was basically see-through right out of the package) was stretched so thin it showed everything.",35403,2
35403,I mean EVERYTHING.,35403,2
35403,These are going back.,35403,2
35403,The pattern was nice though...,35403,2
35404,"When I received this item, stone wobbles.it is not sturdy.",35404,2
35405,"It doesn't look nice on me; however, it looks like it was in the photo.",35405,2
35406,"Too Tight, could see my nursing bra underneath.",35406,2
35406,Wore it anyway under a jacket.,35406,2
35406,Stains easily.,35406,2
35407,this cap is cute but if totally fits like a truckers cap and the brim did not seem as rounded as in the photos.,35407,2
35407,the front of the cap is stiff with seams.,35407,2
35407,Wasn't very flattering for me as a woman,35407,2
35408,"The finger openings are very small (despite the overall size of the glove being right for a toddler) making it hard for a child to put them on even with help and several of the gloves had holes, very poor craftsmanship.",35408,2
35409,Is much smaller that described,35409,2
35410,I bought these for my 8 yo and he barely got to wear them!,35410,2
35410,Now they sit in the donate pile.,35410,2
35411,This is for a very petite person.,35411,2
35411,Had to alter the entire dress.,35411,2
35411,The bottom does not lay flat like the picture.,35411,2
35411,"It is almost an upside down ""U"" shape.",35411,2
35411,"The slit ends above my private area :/
  Fabric is very sturdy polyester.",35411,2
35411,"It's for a play, so adding a ton of feathers and extra fabric to make it work.",35411,2
35411,Very disappointed.,35411,2
35411,Very lovely on the pictured person---must be very short curvy girl.,35411,2
35411,"If you are taller than 5'3"", don't bother.",35411,2
35411,"I am 5'9"".",35411,2
35412,Really wanted to like this hat.,35412,2
35412,The front part of it has a hard cardboard-like material that makes the hat stiff and almost square like.,35412,2
35412,:/,35412,2
35413,I am ALWAYS a size large.,35413,2
35413,After reading the reviews of this dress I decided to order both a large and an XL  just to make sure.,35413,2
35413,"The large was slightly too small and the XL was GIANT, both were waaaay too long.",35413,2
35413,"On top of that, I had to return the large because it arrived ripped.",35413,2
35413,"I tailored the XL to fit better, but the fabric and craftsmanship is so poor that the seams fell apart the first time I wore it.",35413,2
35413,Unfortunate because it is such a cute dress.,35413,2
35413,"Poor quality, though.",35413,2
35414,too small and not to my liking.,35414,2
35415,"I usually wear large sizes but this was way too large, The sleeve length was way out of proportion",35415,2
35416,It's honestly a children's product not one for men.,35416,2
35416,Ended up giving them to my little brother.,35416,2
35417,Great Looks but came way to big,35417,2
35418,Small fit.,35418,2
35419,I read reviews prior to purchasing and ordered a size up.,35419,2
35419,Bottoms are a little snug but they fit.,35419,2
35419,"Top is waaaay too big tho, which I don't understand because I read a review of a girl the same bra size as me that ordered a large, a size bigger than what I ordered, and said hers fit perfectly.",35419,2
35419,Is there any way I can return top for a smaller size or do I have to order another suit in a size small?,35419,2
35420,The neck line was not wide enough for it to hang off the shoulder.,35420,2
35420,It looked more like a regular sweatshirt along the neckline.,35420,2
35421,"This shirt was advertised as tall, not big and tall.",35421,2
35421,My husband is slender and is 6'3 so finding shirts is quite a challenge.,35421,2
35421,"While the length of this shirt is great, he completely swims in it.",35421,2
35421,It would make a great big and tall shirt but i'd hope it to be advertised as such.,35421,2
35421,"The material, while very soft and breathable, is very thin and would require an undershirt beneath it.",35421,2
35422,WAY TO SMALL...GET 2-3 TIMES BIGGER THAN YOUR NORMAL SIZE...WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT...IT DOESNT LOOK OR FIT AS IT SHOWS IN THE PHOTO....,35422,2
35423,the lettering was ruined after the first wash :(,35423,2
35424,Not nearly nice as expected.,35424,2
35424,Run small.,35424,2
35424,Prefer the Costco / Kirkland equivalent that are 5 dollars cheaper.,35424,2
35425,"The material looks cheap, and they skimped on the amount of material used to make it.",35425,2
35425,The cut is weird.,35425,2
35425,BUT I've ordered the same thing from the same seller and got a awesome cotton one that was cut correctly.,35425,2
35425,The seller isn't consistent but for the price it's with the chance.,35425,2
35425,I wear it around the house now.,35425,2
35426,"I liked the purse, but they put a fragrance envelope that makes the purse smell.",35426,2
35426,It will takes days to get it out.,35426,2
35426,They shouldn't put that envelope in it for people who have allergies.,35426,2
35426,"The purse itself is good, but the smell is terrible.",35426,2
35427,Very see-through.,35427,2
35427,"I got a medium and I am 5'9"" and about 140 lbs.",35427,2
35427,"The length is fine, the fit is a little tight.",35427,2
35427,But the dress is very see through.,35427,2
35427,"Also, it isn't very well made, so the stitching comes apart easily.",35427,2
35428,muy chica,35428,2
35429,I'm normally a small and ordered a large base upon the reviews and unfortunately it still was too small.,35429,2
35429,I returned it and got a refund.,35429,2
35430,This ring looks very cheap,35430,2
35431,I was super excited about this product.,35431,2
35431,The first time my son wore it two of the buttons busted within the hour.,35431,2
35431,very disappointed but you get what you pay for I suppose.,35431,2
35431,Otherwise it was exactly how I expected it to be.,35431,2
35431,"Warm, cozy, & super cute.",35431,2
35432,"I loved the design of this bag, but was disappointed because the card slots were not all the correct size to hold my cards, very frustrating.",35432,2
35432,I sent it back!,35432,2
35433,"It looks great on and is a nice enough sweater, but the very moment on stitch pulls, the fabric tears and unravels the entire sweater.",35433,2
35433,"And sadly, it is very easy to do.",35433,2
35433,"I got a stitch caught on my ring the first time I put it on and within a few hours, the sleeve had started to unravel right down the arm.",35433,2
35433,Only wear this if you have no chance of it getting caught on anything.,35433,2
35434,very see through cant wear to go out,35434,2
35435,I returned it.,35435,2
35435,"It's much thinner than I thought it would be, and has a lot of those fashiony holes in it.",35435,2
35435,It gets really cold here in the winter and I need something really thick.,35435,2
35436,"Looks stunning... For a couple of weeks, then it turns copper.",35436,2
35436,Great for someone you don't see being in a relationship for more than a month.,35436,2
35436,"Defiantly not for someone you care about, even the box didn't survive opening more than twice.",35436,2
35437,The dress was made of good material but it was super small.,35437,2
35438,Wayyyy too small of a shirt.,35438,2
35438,Very disappointed with the fit of the fabric.,35438,2
35438,It was very tight & I could barely get it on.,35438,2
35438,Followed all of the size charts and looked at the reviews from others.,35438,2
35438,Overall displeased with the outcome of this shirt.,35438,2
35439,Would have been great if it hadn't been about 5 inches less than advertised--not even close to fitting.,35439,2
35440,The boots are beautiful yet after just two wears the balls on the right boot fell off.,35440,2
35440,It seems they are not secure enough on the strings.. Now the boots still look good its just that I wish the balls would of stayed on longer,35440,2
35441,too short but too big.,35441,2
35441,Made for small people,35441,2
35442,Bought 2 different color dusters for my mom.,35442,2
35442,"They looked great on the picture, but in reality not so much.",35442,2
35442,"First of all, material is very thin not what you would expect from flannel.",35442,2
35442,"Second, after one wash using gentle cycle with cold water dusters were all covered with fuzz balls.",35442,2
35442,Very disappointed.,35442,2
35443,Very disappointed in this shirt.,35443,2
35443,Very low quality.,35443,2
35443,this thing is as thin as a Hillary excuse.,35443,2
35443,I ordered a 4XL.,35443,2
35443,Cause I like a loose fit.,35443,2
35443,That part of the shirt was fine.,35443,2
35443,However the sleeve length sucks.,35443,2
35443,It only goes about two inches past my elbow.,35443,2
35443,Which would be great if I were a T-Rex.,35443,2
35443,But I'm not.,35443,2
35444,In the picture it shows box chain but I got very thin snake chain.,35444,2
35444,May be because it is an add-on item and seller didn't care what they are shipping out.,35444,2
35445,Heavy fabric.,35445,2
35445,Runs really large.,35445,2
35445,Returned.,35445,2
35446,Very cheap feeling and not warm at all.,35446,2
35446,not chunky either or it is made for a child.,35446,2
35446,"I got an XL, which I am not normally but could tell the product ran small.",35446,2
35447,Bought these for a friend and they constantly fall out of his ears.,35447,2
35448,DID NOT LIKE IT,35448,2
35449,"The quality feels good, however the neck portion is too small and doesn't cover it as it should.",35449,2
35449,Maybe for a kid.,35449,2
35450,The bag itself is quite nice but I wanted total white.,35450,2
35450,This bag is off white.,35450,2
35451,Fit was tiny!,35451,2
35451,"I am 5'1"", 110 lbs and the 0-2 (which is my size) was skin tight.",35451,2
35451,"Disappointing, because the stye and color was cute.",35451,2
35451,"Returned, return was processed quickly.",35451,2
35452,"It broke apart within 3 weeks after regular usage, I would not recommend this product to others.",35452,2
35453,NO SUPPORT JUST LIKE A LOOSE RAG.NO BOTTOMS,35453,2
35454,A few of the buttons came off right away and it runs very small I got the biggest size and it's still small.,35454,2
35455,I didn't expect it to be that large so I'm returning it for a smaller one.,35455,2
35456,Shorter after wash.,35456,2
35457,Ordered an extra large because of my bust.,35457,2
35457,I ordered exactly according to the measurements.,35457,2
35457,Still too small.,35457,2
35457,The thong fit well so I kept the item just had to wear a different top.,35457,2
35458,Sizing is way off and it is MUCH thinner than it appears.,35458,2
35458,"Also, took too long to get.",35458,2
35459,Bright pink and runs large,35459,2
35460,Looked like crap like it had black gunk all over it.,35460,2
35461,"very nice, just way too big for my 7 year old",35461,2
35462,Comes apart to easy,35462,2
35463,"It was a nice thin long sleeve but, its not what showed in the picture.",35463,2
35464,"the shipment arrived and there were no Boot tops, tiara, belt, bracelets included!",35464,2
35465,These had big black spots.,35465,2
35465,I heard you can return but qc should be better and not sending this stuff so messed up.,35465,2
35466,I ordered this shirt in a 2XL which is my normal size for these tee shirts.,35466,2
35466,A 2XL will usually fit OK for me although for some shirts they are too large so I have to drop down to an XL.,35466,2
35466,The 2XL was too baggy and the neckline was too wide.,35466,2
35466,So I ordered another one in an XL which was too tight.,35466,2
35466,Both of these shirts are tailored like a garbage bag with a hole cut into it for the neckline.,35466,2
35466,The XL had the additional feature of looking like it had been washed 100 times before I received it.,35466,2
35466,So as an experiment I ordered another 2XL from Super Hero Stuff.,35466,2
35466,That one fits totally different.,35466,2
35466,The neckline is OK.,35466,2
35466,Although strangely the one they sent me has the same artwork on the front and back which is yet another defect but at least it fits OK.,35466,2
35466,This is telling me different sellers are shipping different versions of this shirt.,35466,2
35466,Generally I think there's problems with the quality control for these sublimated shirts.,35466,2
35466,I have received some where the artwork is blurry like the shirt was moving around when they applied the artwork.,35466,2
35466,Then I got this XL with the dull colors.,35466,2
35466,I get the impression that some sellers are rummaging through the dumpsters and shipping out the rejects that the factory threw away.,35466,2
35466,People who order this shirt would not know about all of this unless they ordered it from multiple sellers as I have.,35466,2
35466,As it is right now I have a 2XL that fits but with the same image on the front and the back.,35466,2
35466,I can't win with this shirt.,35466,2

35467,sorry had to send this one back.,35467,2
35467,Much too large,35467,2
35468,Smaller than the size I ordered ..,35468,2
35468,I ordered XL size and fits tight like L size,35468,2
35469,"Bought the first one, the strap broke so we returned and got a new one.",35469,2
35469,Now the second one's strap broke... too late to return... My kid loved the watch while it lasted.,35469,2
35470,loock soooooo cheap,35470,2
35471,Straps are set too wide and constantly falls off my shoulders.,35471,2
35471,There's no point in the zipper as the bodice is cut so wide you don't need one to pull it on.,35471,2
35471,I do like the pockets.,35471,2
35471,"My plan is to remove the zipper and sew the back seam up tighter, then it will make an ok nightgown.",35471,2
35472,Did not arrive as pictured.,35472,2
35472,The ones I received were all blue.,35472,2
35473,Beautiful shirt but wayyyy to small.,35473,2
35473,I ordered a 2X because it said to size up well it was more like a large... and the arms are super slim I couldn't even get my arms in it,35473,2
35474,I don't want to leave a scathing review because my feelings about the trunks may be due to size.,35474,2
35474,The size I ordered fit me nicely around the waste.,35474,2
35474,I kinda liked how short they were.,35474,2
35474,This is why I can't wear them.,35474,2
35474,The pocket won't hold my package in place.,35474,2
35474,The inside layer doesn't have any elastic to hold me in place.,35474,2
35474,"Since there isn't much room in the first place, things have to go somewhere;  and they escape.",35474,2
35474,I am medium size.,35474,2
35475,Suitable for high heels only.,35475,2
35476,This was a pretty dress.,35476,2
35476,I wore it for a wedding and it looked really nice.,35476,2
35476,However we ordered 6 for all the bridesmaids and the lace was different on them.,35476,2
35476,Also I wear a size 12 usually and so I ordered a 16 because nice dresses are typically a little smaller and I wanted to be comfortable.,35476,2
35476,Also it's easier to take in a dress than let one out.,35476,2
35476,My dress was so small!!,35476,2
35476,I really had to squeeze to put it on.,35476,2
35476,Not only that but the zipper was pretty crappy.,35476,2
35476,It was bright red while the rest of the dress was burgundy.,35476,2
35476,It stuck out.,35476,2
35476,The other 5 girls did not have the zipper problem.,35476,2
35476,The worst part was that after the wedding the dress wouldn't unzip because of the zipper.,35476,2
35476,We had to break the zipper to get it off of me.,35476,2
35477,Looked nothing like shape depicted here and the measurements were wrong.,35477,2
35477,Medium is huge following on me.,35477,2
35477,It looks highly unflattering and defintely not a steel boned corset for waist training more like costume.,35477,2
35478,"These are not suitable for babies for two primary reasons:
1.",35478,2
35478,The bow is shaped by wires inside them.,35478,2
35478,The wires are plastic coated but the tips are still sharp.,35478,2
35478,I was able to remove them through the seems.,35478,2
35478,I can imagine my baby getting her hands around the bows and it poking her.,35478,2
35478,2.,35478,2
35478,The material is soft and elastic but slips off easily from baby's head when she moves around the floor and in her stroller.,35478,2
35478,I would not recommend these for babies.,35478,2
35478,Only older children who can sit still can keep them on for a reasonably long time,35478,2
35479,Very poor quality!!!!,35479,2
35479,!,35479,2
35480,These glasses are too expensive for the quality of materials.,35480,2
35480,Very cute and quite stylish.,35480,2
35480,"If I had gotten them for $10.00, I would be more satisfied.",35480,2
35481,the velvet string is to crinkled and I cannot get it to fix my neck it needs to be smaller,35481,2
35482,Large was way too small and I usually wear a medium.,35482,2
35483,This really more of a novelty than anything.,35483,2
35483,Too small with an uncomfortable band.,35483,2
35483,Average quality material.,35483,2
35484,"Returning back, size is way smaller than it says.",35484,2
35484,But Amazon will refund your money very easily!!,35484,2
35484,!,35484,2
35485,This shirt is probably fine for a small chested thin woman...,35485,2
35485,"If your ladies are on the large size, they will not be covered and the drape in the front looks funny.",35485,2
35485,Also it's a cheaply made shirt (which is why it was so cheap to buy)...,35485,2
35486,"Thin, awkward seams.",35486,2
35486,Returned.,35486,2
35487,I read the reviews and ordered this shirt based on what I read.,35487,2
35487,I was really disappointed in the quality and fit.,35487,2
35487,Do not recommend.,35487,2
35488,Good fit.,35488,2
35488,Only problem is the design is way smaller than it is advertised,35488,2
35489,very cheap fabric and poorly made.,35489,2
35490,Really sad that the sizing is so inconsistent.,35490,2
35490,"I ordered three dresses - the black, the pink, and the one with the swallows.",35490,2
35490,I'm a size 12 and according to another reviewer I went with the Medium.,35490,2
35490,"The black fit like a size small on me, the pink fit perfectly (but I'm returning because I'm going to sweat in the material, polyester is not breathable), and the one with the swallows was an entirely different dress - this dress was actually a wrap dress, the others are faux wrap, and the material is different, also it fit like an XS.",35490,2
35490,I'm ordering the largest size (L) but I think it will still be small.,35490,2
35491,These seem to run way to small.,35491,2
35492,"I wore these yesterday for the first time and the back on one of them broke within the hour, also won't stay up on the ear.",35492,2
35492,They are pretty but not of much use if they break that easily.,35492,2
35493,"The lace by the breasts split open,  and ripped but they fit my tummy well",35493,2
35494,Beautiful and comfy but sizing is off.,35494,2
35494,I am 5'7 weight 170lbs bra size 40D and the XL couldn't even pass my shoulders.,35494,2
35494,I am reordering a larger size because this top is very pretty.,35494,2
35494,I just received the 4XL and it is still too small!,35494,2
35494,this is ridiculous.,35494,2
35494,My size is XL.,35494,2
35494,This blouse arrived with 3 others from different vendors.,35494,2
35494,All XL and all fitting me perfectly.,35494,2
35494,Cannot recommend,35494,2
35495,Way too small,35495,2
35496,"The colors were pretty, but the dress runs really small.",35496,2
35496,"I have had fairly good luck with ordering XXL dresses, and they had fit well, but this dress was very disappointing.",35496,2
35497,thin material but cute and runs a little small,35497,2
35498,Runs very small for the size.,35498,2
35498,This is really size should be marked for Asian standard rather than USA size standard.,35498,2
35498,Seller was nice but would have had to buy another item to get the right size shipped.,35498,2
35498,A bit complicated.,35498,2
35498,I should have ordered an XXLarge to get an actual Large size.,35498,2
35498,Oh well.,35498,2
35499,Buyer Beware!,35499,2
35499,I got these glasses thinking the lenses would be a lot shorter.,35499,2
35499,"In reality, the lenses are 1.5"" tall and 1 7/8"" wide.",35499,2
35499,They look like they have a much lower profile in the photo.,35499,2
35499,"In addition, the plastic above the nose bridge and on the crown (on the edges where the arms swing out is a lot bigger (about 1/4 inch taller) than the photo depicts.",35499,2
35499,"Lastly, the brown ones have a ""spotted leopard"" pattern on them that no man should be caught wearing.",35499,2
35499,Too bad they left all of thos out of the product description.,35499,2
35499,I'll be returning mine.,35499,2
35500,I'm 5 feet tall and yet the pair is too short.,35500,2
35500,I bought the largest size.,35500,2
35500,Careful with sizes!,35500,2
35500,!,35500,2
35501,"Not sure if it was the way the dress was made or just not cut to size 12 specifications, but the proportions were way out of whack.",35501,2
35501,I'm a pretty standard size 12.,35501,2
35501,"5'9"" 160lbs long torso & legs.",35501,2
35501,"I ordered a couple other sun dresses Nicole Miller, Calvin Klein, and a few others & they all fit just fine.",35501,2
35501,"Simple dress, just what I was looking for in a neutral color that looked great with my brunette hair color.",35501,2
35502,"Looks nice, is very very light, was packaged well, but is tooo small & won't adjust much, so cant be worn.",35502,2
35502,Disappointed.,35502,2
35503,"The material is too firm so they are not adjustable, They do not stay on.",35503,2
35504,"top fits fine, but buttons don't stay butttoned.",35504,2
35504,I love the pjs and have the short sleeve ones too.,35504,2
35505,"I ordered a size 18, which is what I always wear in a bathing suit.",35505,2
35505,The molded cups did not hit the right spot do this did not fit at all.,35505,2
35505,I am returning it.,35505,2
35505,The reason for 2 stars is that it is very pretty.,35505,2
35505,Perhaps it would fit someone with a long torso.,35505,2
35506,Shirt looks nice and the material feels very comfortable.,35506,2
35506,"However, even ordering an XL size (I wear L in USA sizes), the shirt is very tight, both in the arms and shoulders.",35506,2
35506,Buyer beware.,35506,2
35507,Was disappointed in the quality of this top.,35507,2
35507,I love the design but not the best material and not put together well.,35507,2
35508,Looked like expensive glasses but one of the nose pads was broken when I received these glasses.,35508,2
35509,"These underwear fit my 31/2 years old girl perfect, unfortunately the quality is very poor.",35509,2
35509,"You must HAND WASH them, if you wash them in the laundry machine, they will be destroy.",35509,2
35509,"I don't have time to hand wash underwear, so I am not happy with the poor quality of these product.",35509,2
35510,The item had fairly good reviews so I was looking forward to it.,35510,2
35510,It's light weight but the material feels and looks so cheap.,35510,2
35510,There was a rose potpourri in the wallet and that smell was disgusting.,35510,2
35510,It made me feel nauseous.,35510,2
35510,I'm returning the item mostly because of the smell.,35510,2
35511,is too small,35511,2
35512,Fits great but material is not good.,35512,2
35513,The fabric feels nice but the size runs small.,35513,2
35513,It says it's a one size fits all but it's really only a large size.,35513,2
35514,REALLLYY SHORT.,35514,2
35514,I am 5 ft 4 in and about 120 lbs.,35514,2
35514,"I wear a small or xs in dresses usually... also, if u have boobs - the strings do not hold them together.. so a thin person with no boobs, this would look good on!",35514,2
35514,I am going to wear it as a shirt,35514,2
35515,I bought and paid for ten pieces.....only 6 are in my package.,35515,2
35515,Totally annoyed,35515,2
35516,Broke after 3 days,35516,2
35517,Size runs smal.,35517,2
35518,The dress is good quality... but it was way too big.,35518,2
35518,The skirt should come down to around the knees but mine went to the floor when I got it.,35518,2
35519,I loved them when I first got them but after 2 weeks they started turning my ears green.,35519,2
35519,I was very disappointed because I read the reviews and everyone was saying that these didn't turn green.,35519,2
35520,Way too small XXL seemed more like a L.,35520,2
35521,Very cheap feeling and easily ripped at the shoulder.,35521,2
35522,This shirt did not come how I thought it would.,35522,2
35522,It was very poor quality and the length is NOT what is shown in the picture.,35522,2
35522,It was more of a crop top than a tank top.,35522,2
35522,Definitely not worth the money.,35522,2
35523,Cheap,35523,2
35524,"When I bought this, I thought the two circles would be seperate.",35524,2
35524,They are actually glued to each other.,35524,2
35524,It looks very tacky.,35524,2
35524,"The chain in awful quality, and it looks like you bought it for your four-year-old at a pawn shop.",35524,2
35524,Don't waste your dollar on this.,35524,2
35525,The fabric had some small snags on the front when I got it.,35525,2
35526,"soft, but very small",35526,2
35527,Too small and transparent,35527,2
35528,Had some 32's from a friend I liked but were a tad small.,35528,2
35528,Tried 33's and felt like I was swimming in them.,35528,2
35529,I was pretty dissapointed when I got these leggings in the mail.,35529,2
35529,They are more like tights.,35529,2
35529,They fit just fine but they are completely see-through on me.,35529,2
35529,I can't seem to find any legging that isn't see through.,35529,2
35530,"Really thinking about returning this item , the fabric was similar to muslin cloth , order size smaller.",35530,2
35531,It looks must better in the picture than when you get.,35531,2
35532,It's a very weird material.,35532,2
35533,Its rly big I thought it would hug my nose but it dont,35533,2
35534,The sweater material no good!,35534,2
35534,Electrical and stinging!,35534,2
35535,It is really stiff and does not sit on the wrist very good.,35535,2
35536,This bracelet broke the second time I wore it.,35536,2
35537,Crooked ring.,35537,2
35537,But they are beautiful.,35537,2
35537,I love wearing them out.,35537,2
35538,I bought this shirt for a Fourth of July party.,35538,2
35538,I ended up returning the shirt because it fit like a loose sports bra on me.,35538,2
35538,"I am 5'6 ans 105 pounds and I ordered a size small, the shirt fit okay, but it was too short.",35538,2
35538,"It was like an extra extra short crop top, that resembled a sports bra look.",35538,2
35538,The colors and pattern were very similar to the picture.,35538,2
35538,"However, it was the fit that I was disappointed by the most.",35538,2
35538,"The arm holes are very small and tight fitting, and I have skinny stick like arms.",35538,2
35538,"The picture also makes the shirt look like a high low, but it is cut with the same length hem all the way around, not as flattering ad the picture petrays.",35538,2
35538,"I liked the pattern and colors, disliked the fit and style of shirt mainly because I thought it would fit differently based on the pictures and the description.",35538,2
35538,It would make for a good swim suit cover up.,35538,2
35539,Not like the picture.,35539,2
35539,The scarf lost the pompons in a week ... Not a good quality,35539,2
35540,No like,35540,2
35541,It's a nice shirt but it came with a hole in it.,35541,2
35541,I use it as a night time shirt because its big and comfy.,35541,2
35542,Not exactly what I thought I was buying.,35542,2
35542,"Color was a little off, size is not accurate.",35542,2
35542,Just not happy planning to return.,35542,2
35543,I ordered this for my boyfriend for Christmas & he immediately started using it.,35543,2
35543,"The wallet is already, as of March torn to pieces.",35543,2
35543,"Granted, he's hard on things.",35543,2
35543,"However, the top part fell apart because of the soft leather & the bottom is still in tact, as the bottom is thicker.",35543,2
35543,The wallet looked great though when I received it & I did receive it quickly.,35543,2
35544,Love the vest.,35544,2
35544,But they sent larges instead of small.,35544,2
35545,I've bought two of these now and neither has been very good.,35545,2
35545,The wig is very loose even when belted down correctly and bobby pinned all over.,35545,2
35545,The wefts are thin.,35545,2
35545,At points you can see the base wig cap through the hair.,35545,2
35545,"The 2nd wig I got, one of the wefts in front was detached from the liner completely.",35545,2
35545,I had to hand-sew it in place so it wasn't hanging down in a rectangle over my eyes.,35545,2
35545,The pigtails for the first one look all right though they are far more orange than this photo.,35545,2
35545,The 2nd wig is closer in color to the picture.,35545,2
35545,In case you're wondering... yeah.,35545,2
35545,There's no consistency in quality here.,35545,2
35545,Obviously made by different people even though they're sold by the same brand.,35545,2
35545,Anyway.,35545,2
35545,The clips on the first set are so tight I can barely open them.,35545,2
35545,The second set are much better but have about half as much hair on them as the first.,35545,2
35545,The 2nd wig is very short in the back.,35545,2
35545,I thought I put it on backward the first time but no.,35545,2
35545,It was just really short.,35545,2
35545,The second comes to about mid-neck.,35545,2
35545,I will not be buying another of these wigs.,35545,2
35545,They are not worth the price.,35545,2
35545,These are $10 wigs at best.,35545,2
35546,too small n too transparent.,35546,2
35546,not worth spending money,35546,2
35547,Too small!,35547,2
35547,:(,35547,2
35548,Not what expected.,35548,2
35549,Really sad to say I'm returning this bag after less than a week of use.,35549,2
35549,It is cute from the outside and I love the idea of it.,35549,2
35549,Sadly though it has MAJOR downfalls.,35549,2
35549,Right off the bat I hate that the straps cross over the top of the bag it makes it really difficult to get into.,35549,2
35549,Then and most importantly I used the bag for less than a week and its already falling apart :( the strap is ripping off at the bottom and the inside lining is ripping off.,35549,2
35549,I wasn't rough with the bag I treat mine well I have many moderately cheap ones from places like target ect.,35549,2
35549,and they hold up great but this one was a bummer.,35549,2
35550,I ask a small size and I received a Large and the sleeves are too long.,35550,2
35551,Sizes at least two sizes smaller than expected ... material see thru and thin...,35551,2
35552,The shoe is really big for a 6.,35552,2
35552,Fits more like an 8,35552,2
35553,I ordered an XL and couldn't wait for it to come in.,35553,2
35553,When it did the top was a bit small so it didn't look cute like in the pic but it could work.,35553,2
35553,The buttons were like an XS they were so tiny there is no way I could have even got them on.,35553,2
35554,"Flimsy material, awkward fit, definitely too small",35554,2
35555,I ordered this in both black and beige.,35555,2
35555,The beige skirt fit great and has a classic look.,35555,2
35555,The black skirt OF THE SAME SIZE was over an inch shorter and was tighter than the beige skirt.,35555,2
35555,I thought that perhaps I had received a mistake size so I exchanged it.,35555,2
35555,That was not the case.,35555,2
35555,The black skirt of the same size is smaller than small and too short to be dignified.,35555,2
35555,"It is hard enough buying clothes of different brands, but the same size from the same merchant of the same style should be exactly that ... the same size.",35555,2
35555,This was not.,35555,2
35556,Not very comfortable.,35556,2
35556,Also a bit cramped.,35556,2
35556,"Don't care for the way the back fits, and the pouch isn't big enough.",35556,2
35556,My penis kind of bends instead of hanging comfortably which also bunches my other parts up.,35556,2
35556,Ordered a medium which is bigger in the waist size than what I normally wear.,35556,2
35557,Size Chart is not accurate.,35557,2
35557,XX-Large is equal to a M in US sizes.,35557,2
35558,Nice grey and quality of jean.,35558,2
35558,"However, pant legs are too wide.",35558,2
35558,Very bulky.,35558,2
35558,Requesting a refund.,35558,2
35559,"did not quite like the belt, good leather",35559,2
35560,"Material is cheap feeling but then again the tank is very inexpensive, I ordered an xl however I should have went with a large but I'd rather too big then too small because I can always break out the sewing machine :) overall it's an ok tank and I will get use our of it.",35560,2
35560,Colors are very pretty.,35560,2
35561,We ordered iphone 6 plus case.,35561,2
35561,And it came iphone 6 case.,35561,2
35561,My dad loves glasses but he has too big phone for the case so ...not really good so he cut space for glasses in case and glued it to bigger old case :D,35561,2
35562,they won't stay up on your earlobes they fall down,35562,2
35563,I'm a Large and I saw it ran small so I gota XXL but it was still too small.,35563,2
35563,So maybe order 3 sizes up.,35563,2
35563,Other lovely.,35563,2
35563,Material was gorgeous and the pattern was solid.,35563,2
35563,The embroidered jewel neckline is a pin on and can be taken off.,35563,2
35564,"Really cute outfit, but the button holes are cut too large to hold the buttons closed.",35564,2
35564,It's basically an oddly shaped blanket on a naked baby 20 minutes in.,35564,2
35565,I don't know if it shrunk when I washed it or just came that way but it does not fit well.,35565,2
35565,I got it for Christmas and didn't try it on right away and then it got thrown in the washer before I could see if it fit.,35565,2
35565,"The arm length is good and fits well, but the rest of it is short and doesn't look right when on.",35565,2
35565,I should have gotten a larger size so it could hang down like shown in the photo but I got it in a large which is the normal short size I wear.,35565,2
35565,"Maybe I can find a way to make it work, but as of right now it's just going to hang in my closet.",35565,2
35566,"Nice material, but was way bigger than expected.",35566,2
35567,The dress is good quality and fits a little too small.,35567,2
35567,"However, I returned it was due to the fact that only about 30% of the dress is not see through and I only expected the slevels and the back top half to be.",35567,2
35568,"very pretty, and great cost - but broke after first wear",35568,2
35569,This charm is very pretty but with in the first 2 weeks 2 stones fell out.,35569,2
35569,Guess you get what you pay for.,35569,2
35570,Cute but not at all the size I was expecting.,35570,2
35570,Ended up giving it to another granddaughter,35570,2
35571,"The neck opening was too small,  I wanted more chest and shoulder exposed.",35571,2
35571,I didn't like the short cheap undergarment attached.,35571,2
35572,Didn't keep time properly don't think automatic arts work properly,35572,2
35573,I'm a size medium and bought an XL but had to give it away.,35573,2
35574,Too big and looked cheap.,35574,2
35575,WAYYY too small.,35575,2
35575,One of those cheap shirts I would not recommend at all.,35575,2
35575,Skin tight when I bought a large and usually wear a medium...,35575,2
35576,Hated these.,35576,2
35576,"They only cover about the to half of my foot, so the tongue would rub and irritate my foot all day.",35576,2
35576,I have a size 10.5 for most shoes.,35576,2
35576,I tried the two sizes that were supposed to encompass that range and they were both way too small.,35576,2
35576,They also left am itchy mark from where the elastic was on my foot.,35576,2
35576,I hated them more and more as the days progressed for those reasons.,35576,2
35576,I bet they're great for like...,35576,2
35576,"The loafers with the tassels on them that only cover your toes (like the make quicker if a women's ""flats"").",35576,2
35576,"I wore these socks with  a pair of Sperry's and I still hated them, almost to the point of rather just wear ankle socks.",35576,2
35577,The dress was too sheer.,35577,2
35577,Could see right through it.,35577,2
35577,Poor quality material in my opinion.,35577,2
35578,This would be so cute if the size was accurate!,35578,2
35578,I bought the adult one for myself and this one for my daughter and this one fits me!,35578,2
35579,The quality of the material is nothing like I expected.,35579,2
35579,"It is very thing, see through, and poorly made.",35579,2
35579,"Also, size runs very small.",35579,2
35579,Couldn't even lift my arms in it and a medium is normally a bit roomy on me.,35579,2
35579,I was disappointed because it's really cute.,35579,2
35580,This is made VERY cheap and thin.,35580,2
35580,Okay for price I guess but the head piece does not stick up like in the picture...it falls flat.,35580,2
35581,I loved the pattern of this suit and was excited to receive it but unfortunately it was too small.,35581,2
35581,The body part wasn't long enough to properly cover my chest so I'm not sure a bigger size would help.,35581,2
35581,But maybe I'll try it on again next summer!,35581,2
35581,"(I'm 5'4"", 120 lbs, and I ordered a small, if that helps!)",35581,2
35582,"Not crazy about it, the leather looks so fake and shiny.",35582,2
35583,These don't mold to breasts very well...you can see the creases through the shirt.,35583,2
35584,This was very short in the arm length.,35584,2
35584,"I ordered a Medium (I usually wear small or medium, 5'6"" 120 lbs).",35584,2
35584,But the arm length was well above my wrist.,35584,2
35584,"The arms are very slim, so if you have larger arms, this might be tight.",35584,2
35584,Plus the waist length was just barely below my hips.,35584,2
35584,The cut was not  nearly as cute as the picture because it didn't drape in a cascading fashion.,35584,2
35584,"It looked more like it was cut short in the front asymmetrically, it just looked odd.",35584,2
35584,The material is very thin.,35584,2
35584,"Reminded me of t shirt material, but very cheap and thin not even Old Navy or Target quality.",35584,2
35584,Ordered in dark brown and burgundy (more purple).,35584,2
35584,Will return.,35584,2
35585,Way too small...very disappointed because it is such a cute top.,35585,2
35586,"Love the multiple rows of hooks, but i could've gotten a 3x instead of a 6x as this runs true to size.",35586,2
35587,The hoops in the slip were too large for the dress,35587,2
35588,"These earrings came early, However, the package was torn ( even the small bag inside ) and the earrings (both) were bent real bad.",35588,2
35588,Even the backings didn't fit  (got 1 free ).,35588,2
35588,"I like them but , I can't tell if they are real Sterling Silver or not.",35588,2
35588,"I'll revise my opinion if I find the 925, although it is said on here that sometimes they are not marked (?)",35588,2
35588,So I'll let you know.,35588,2
35589,Ripped within the first 3 days of use.,35589,2
35590,Its a cute dress but too small.,35590,2
35591,I was very disappointed with these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics as they were very uncomfortable in my shoes.,35591,2
35591,They raised my toes up so high that they rubbed against my shoe and it was quite painful.,35591,2
35591,I only kept them on about 2 hours as that is all I could stand.,35591,2
35591,"Unfortunately,  they are going back.",35591,2
35591,"Oh well, the search is still on....",35591,2
35592,Material sucks.,35592,2
35592,Its nylon like,35592,2
35593,Beautiful but came broken.,35593,2
35593,The tassel was not attached to the ring.,35593,2
35593,I'll give it two stars because they issued my refund quickly.,35593,2
35594,Fit is all wrong.,35594,2
35594,I purchased a size L in the store which fit me fine.,35594,2
35594,But I damaged it a couple of months later.,35594,2
35594,Ordered XL from Amazon and it's too small.,35594,2
35595,Bought the same shirt in two different colours.,35595,2
35595,Green one fit more like a 3XLT (maybe even a bit longer).,35595,2
35596,The clasp is too tight to be able to close easily.,35596,2
35596,A different type of clasp is needed.,35596,2
35597,Xl too small,35597,2
35598,Bad quality,35598,2
35599,i was not pleased.,35599,2
35599,I thought this locked like a thicker material on the pictures provided.,35599,2
35599,"I wore it once and washed it, it came undone at the seems and the black faded.",35599,2
35599,"I guess you get what you get
For the price.",35599,2
35600,Don't waste your money on this one...the colors look nothing whatsoever like the picture,35600,2
35601,"I do like the graphic, and colors, but they should make a better way to figure out your size.",35601,2
35601,It's way to small :( Very disappointed!,35601,2
35602,The hat was scrunched up in a plastic bag for shipping and is too wrinkled to decently wear in public.,35602,2
35603,1st wash and it's already fading,35603,2
35604,I don't know who did there sizing but they need to put out a bold notice to all customers before buying.,35604,2
35604,Now if they did fit for nursing bra they are really nice and you can not beat the price for 3 of them.,35604,2
35605,"Nice print, but this does not run true to size.",35605,2
35606,"I am a 38D and I bought the 2XL as it said it would for 40"" bust.",35606,2
35606,IT DOES NOT!,35606,2
35606,I'm going to have to give it to my sister.,35606,2
35606,Total bummer bcz it's super cute top :(,35606,2
35607,These yoga pants aren't thick enough to hide your panties.,35607,2
35607,I can even see what color they are underneath just by looking in the mirror.,35607,2
35607,"If you plan to go out in public with these on, prepare to be embarrassed!",35607,2
35608,"Very oddly fitting, Liner for the cups move around inside the shirt and make your boobs unevenly shaped.",35608,2
35608,Not good.,35608,2
35609,The dress is pretty but the dress material is bad it's looks cheap,35609,2
35610,item came in damaged,35610,2
35611,"Love it, but a men's 2XL is a women's medium, at least it fit my girl and I didn't have to send it back.",35611,2
35612,Fun colours.,35612,2
35612,Cheap material,35612,2
35613,"Nice looking, but these things are tiny!",35613,2
35613,"If they fit, you're probably doing something illegal.",35613,2
35614,Beautiful bag butt zippers broke off and the tassles fell out two days into using it .,35614,2
35615,I fully charged them right before an event I was going to and it barely lasted 2 hours.,35615,2
35615,"Tried charging them a again for the second day of the event, and the left shoe completely stopped.",35615,2
35615,Only times I wore them out.,35615,2
35615,Only giving them an extra star because it was helpful finding other friends at night in the event.,35615,2
35615,Will be looking into different brands for future events.,35615,2
35616,They're cute but they don't form to your ear like in the photos.,35616,2
35616,I had to bend the backs to get them to get closer.,35616,2
35616,Found out they work better in my piercing towards the middle of my ear going up to the cuff.,35616,2
35617,Cheap quality unfortunately!,35617,2
35617,Bottoms were small and top is big!,35617,2
35618,Item is very beautiful.,35618,2
35618,But I ordered the 4t and it is both too tight and too long for my four-year-old.,35618,2
35618,She's average sized and a true 4t.,35618,2
35619,Its cute and managed to fit my larger wrist but the clasp broke the 2nd time I wore it.,35619,2
35619,"It shouldnt be too hard to replace the clasp, I was just hoping it would last longer.",35619,2
35619,Also the individual strings on the bracelet are not tight enough to keep them from overlapping each other.,35619,2
35620,They hurt every time you put them in or take them out.,35620,2
35620,OUCH.,35620,2
35621,Way to small.,35621,2
35621,Had to return them right away.,35621,2
35621,My daughter was so disappointed.,35621,2
35621,From the description I was expecting them to be to big.,35621,2
35621,"The shoe itself was cute, to bad they run so small",35621,2
35622,This is my second dress from this company.,35622,2
35622,The dresses are smaller then what is advertised.,35622,2
35622,I probably will not order dresses from Lunajany.,35622,2
35623,"Cute, but the sizing is way off.",35623,2
35624,BAD QUALITY.,35624,2
35624,Bought this bag for my girlfriend and the strap broke on it after 4 months of use and the zipper broke off.,35624,2
35624,"Don't get me wrong the bag looks great and she loved it while it lasted, but a bag should last more than a few months in my opinion.",35624,2
35624,Don't waste your money on this bag if you want a quality product.,35624,2
35625,I got the navy blue polka dot bottoms with the red top....you can see through the butt.,35625,2
35625,"I also ordered according to the size chart, and read the reviews before I ordered.",35625,2
35625,"I am 5'2 and about 125lbs, wear a size sm/4 and a 34C bra.",35625,2
35625,I ordered a large and it is too big.,35625,2
35626,"Good fit, but did not arrive on time",35626,2
35627,Nice,35627,2
35628,two stars because I love the pattern and colors.,35628,2
35628,"Otherwise, save your $$$$
I ordered UP two sizes due to country of origin, it still needs to be about 2"" LONGER!",35628,2
35628,I may wear it with shorts and an over shirt.,35628,2
35629,I purchased these front zip bras to wear post-breast surgery as my usual sports bras that go over my head would not work for me.,35629,2
35629,"The bras are reasonably cute, but there were a few big problems.",35629,2
35629,#1.,35629,2
35629,Way small.,35629,2
35629,I am a 36B.,35629,2
35629,Normally I would buy a size M in a sports bra.,35629,2
35629,"Based on the sizing chart, I ordered a size L. It was quite snug initially, but I thought they would work.",35629,2
35629,"But post surgery, I had some swelling in my chest and it was so uncomfortably tight that I felt like a sausage.",35629,2
35629,It was horrible.,35629,2
35629,I couldn't wait to get home to get the bra off.,35629,2
35629,"At 128 lbs, I never thought I would need an XL, but that is what I probably should have purchased.",35629,2
35629,#2.,35629,2
35629,Zippers not great.,35629,2
35629,Because the bra was so tight it was hard to pull up (especially post surgery with limited arm mobility).,35629,2
35629,One of the zipper pulls broke on the 2nd time I wore the bra.,35629,2
35629,I had to use a safety pin to pull the zipper - didn't work great and was a hassle.,35629,2
35629,#3.,35629,2
35629,Poor stitching on one bra.,35629,2
35629,One of the bras was stitched poorly up the front and resulted in some itchy fabric against my skin.,35629,2
35629,I had to place some gauze between the bra and my skin to keep from itching raw.,35629,2
35629,"Bottom line - I wish I liked these bras more because they seemed like a great value, but there were too many issues.",35629,2
35629,I would like to return these bras but not sure it is worth the hassle.,35629,2
35630,Not like the picture,35630,2
35631,coat is sized for a child not an adult as described,35631,2
35632,"Ordered a large,  as I always do and they always fit.",35632,2
35632,This bikini is more like a small not a large.,35632,2
35633,"This actually fits fine, but it requires a lumpy person with stubby arms to wear it.",35633,2
35633,"I don't know who gets off selling this stuff, its not good, it does not have the feel of the material in the picture.",35633,2
35633,"i'm a fairly fit 6'0 tall person and if i put on 30 lbs and my arms shrunk, it might fit.",35633,2
35634,This looks beautiful on the model and I still don't know what it looks like on me since I couldn't get it over my head.,35634,2
35634,"I generally wear a medium, sometimes a large.",35634,2
35634,This shirt (in a size large) is made exceedingly small and not made as well as it should be for the price.,35634,2
35634,I'm sending it back today.,35634,2
35634,Too bad since I need something similar and now I'm hesitant to order anything else like it.,35634,2
35635,Very cheaply made,35635,2
35636,"Skimpy, cheap, ill-fitting and see-through!",35636,2
35637,get a sizeup.,35637,2
35638,WAY TOO SMALL!!,35638,2
35638,"It's a pretty suit, but meant for very small girls.",35638,2
35638,Definitely order up many sizes,35638,2
35639,wasn't impressed with it gave it to a freind,35639,2
35640,Unfortunately I bought these shoes a size too big.,35640,2
35640,So couldn't really get a decent ride in them.,35640,2
35641,Save your $5.,35641,2
35641,It looks like one of those mini journal lockets.,35641,2
35641,"When I got it, it had a written note inside that fell onto the floor, I picked it up and the multi-folded strip of paper said: ""I Love You.., it's a secret""
I just laughed, because it was a cute idea, but it's a junkie little toy.",35641,2
35642,Is like a L size.,35642,2
35642,I want a xxl,35642,2
35643,the literally tangle ALL THE TIME.,35643,2
35643,i had to fix this threw out the whole day,35643,2
35644,I guess you get what you pay for.,35644,2
35644,"Its really pretty when you get it, but I wore it for 2 days and it turned dull and dingy.",35644,2
35644,I'm not upset only paid a couple dollars for it.,35644,2
35644,"If you are looking for something cheap and cute to wear once or twice, this is perfect.",35644,2
35645,These definitely were on the smaller size compared to the Saxx Mens Pro Elite Performance Boxers I bought alongside this one.,35645,2
35645,"With that said, I don't see a reason to purchase the pro elite either after finding cheaper alternatives with similar cooling ""performance"" and testicular support: the
Champion Men's Tech Performance Boxer",35645,2
35646,"Very pretty, but I had a few ""empty"" patches throughout the backdrop.",35646,2
35646,This needs to be handled very gently..it sheds quite a bit.,35646,2
35647,It is my personal opinion the quality is not what I would find at an optometrist's office,35647,2
35648,Stitching is terrible and coming all out have not even worn it yet that is the way it came.,35648,2
35649,Item runs small.,35649,2
35649,Took several weeks to get here and wasn't impressed with the over all qualify of the dress.,35649,2
35650,I thought the liner would be thicker and the arms in the liner are too tight,35650,2
35651,"This ""dress"" is way to short!",35651,2
35651,"I am 5'4"", size S, with a short torso.",35651,2
35651,"This dress is so short, it barely covers my bottom, and when I raise my arms, it shoots up just below the belly button.",35651,2
35651,I decided to keep it as a house tunic not a dress.,35651,2
35651,It won't help ordering one size up as the shoulders will be too big.,35651,2
35652,Runs small.,35652,2
35653,too short compared to any others i have purchased from urban body jewelry,35653,2
35654,Arrived damaged.,35654,2
35654,"Arms too small,  not as cute as pictured.",35654,2
35654,"I will be returning, gave item two stars because I read the reviews and should have known better.",35654,2
35655,The material is thin and cotton - not the typical material of a leotard.,35655,2
35655,Runs big.,35655,2
35655,Has a drawstring on inside of chest to create a ruched effect... really?,35655,2
35655,For a 4-5 yr old?,35655,2
35655,Come on!,35655,2
35656,Cotton dress.,35656,2
35656,Haven't worn it yet but definitely not an evening dress although good for casual wear.,35656,2
35657,"Sad to day, I am somewhat disappointed.",35657,2
35657,I did not realize the band was some type of rubber.,35657,2
35657,Good for durability but not so good during hot summer days.,35657,2
35657,The dial is not as clear as the illustration and it is hard to read in anything but quite bright light.,35657,2
35658,The fabric and feel of the skirt was not to my liking  and the fit as well.,35658,2
35659,WAY TOO BIG!,35659,2
35659,Great quality but sizing chart is extremely off.,35659,2
35660,ordered a 3x for niece.,35660,2
35660,"but when it came, it did not look as nice as the pic.",35660,2
35660,the dress was basically see through and very cheap looking,35660,2
35661,Very cute but price not appropriate for the amount of silver.,35661,2
35661,(Hollow on the back).,35661,2
35661,If you want something like this though that's perfectly flat on your finger this might do..but look around there is better out there.,35661,2
35661,The design of bow is awesome but should be slightly bigger and the silver more substantial.,35661,2
35662,I don't like the material not as shown on picture,35662,2
35663,too heavy!,35663,2
35664,Very thin.,35664,2
35664,Not worth the price.,35664,2
35664,Get the cheaper costume version because this one isn't better.,35664,2
35665,so imagine that a teacher gave the students the assignment of making this shirt for their first project.,35665,2
35665,"So you will basically get a diy version of the shirt shown... Its was a nice look, but for a little under 5 buck i don't think ill feel confident wearing it out.",35665,2
35665,Maybe round the house or to workout.,35665,2
35665,I might just diy some decals for it just to use it up and practice designs..,35665,2
35665,I am 5'4 and 150 lbs and i ordered an XL.,35665,2
35665,Its not as long as pictures.,35665,2
35665,The sid bar should be tighter and slimmer.,35665,2
35665,"It just looks like u have another black shirt under, not a band.",35665,2
35665,The back might be off center?,35665,2
35665,Maybe thats just me.,35665,2
35665,I rather have my money back and put it towards something that i love.,35665,2
35665,I do like the collar.,35665,2
35665,"Just want a higher quality piece, even for a higher price.",35665,2
35666,The dress is well made except that I am tall and the bodice was very short.,35666,2
35666,"I understand that it is supposed to fit high on the waiste, but if you are taller and larger in the bosom the dress starts to flare out more like an umpire waist fit than at your actual waist.",35666,2
35666,"So it ends up looking very awkward and I am trying to find a belt to try to make it work, otherwise I will have to return it.",35666,2
35667,They run a little big.,35667,2
35667,On first appearance they are very cute.,35667,2
35667,We got these for my daughter's princess-tea-party themed birthday.,35667,2
35667,Her decorations were all pink and gold and she wore a fluffy pink pettiskirt with a custom white pink and gold shirt.,35667,2
35667,On the day of the party she looked adorable.,35667,2
35667,They quickly became my daughter's favorite pair of shoes.,35667,2
35667,She wanted to play dress-up everyday so she could wear these shoes.,35667,2
35667,She has several princess costumes that they paired well with.,35667,2
35667,"They are beautiful and don't look cheap, but literally after only a month and a half of having them the straps tore off at the seam.",35667,2
35667,My daughter was sorely disappointed.,35667,2
35667,"She didn't play outside in them cuz we didn't categorize them as ""play"" shoes.",35667,2
35667,She primarily wore them inside and to church or other functions where she needed to dress appropriately.,35667,2
35667,"They were great while they lasted, they just didn't last long even with easy use.",35667,2
35667,"I'm glad we got them for her birthday because they went perfectly with the princess theme, but I wouldn't purchase them for wearing to school or for everyday wear.",35667,2
35667,"And if you do decide to purchase them I'd watch your little one closely in them, cuz when the strap broke on one of the shoes the other shoe got caught in them and my daughter got pretty banged up in the fall.",35667,2
35667,And all she was doing was walking from our living room to her bedroom.,35667,2
35667,Smh.,35667,2
35667,So disappointed these didn't last longer.,35667,2
35668,Would be cute but it is way too small.,35668,2
35668,"I am 5'6"" 145 lbs.",35668,2
35668,"I normally wear a med/large so I ordered a large at first, ended up ordering a XXL later and it still didn't fit!",35668,2
35668,The torso is way too short.,35668,2
35668,"The metal embellishment at the top of the breast cup where the red is didn't even come up to my breasts, both suits were like this.",35668,2
35668,It's a shame because it would have been cute had it been long enough.,35668,2
35669,"I ordered a large, I'm 5'9"" and a 36C and it's very tight around my shoulders and doesn't come close to covering my chest.",35669,2
35669,The sleeves are not baggy like shown.,35669,2
35669,Most likely will give it away.,35669,2
35670,"Nice looking, but way too small!",35670,2
35671,Won't buy again...fit small.,35671,2
35672,I'm a size 6 and I ordered the large.,35672,2
35672,I could barely get it on!,35672,2
35673,not as nice as it looks in photo,35673,2
35674,This was about 3 sizes too small.,35674,2
35674,I wouldn't recommend to any woman who is rather large chested.,35674,2
35674,It was too tight in the chest area.,35674,2
35674,Perfect for someone smaller in that area.,35674,2
35675,too big med size returned to amazon.,35675,2
35676,"Blouse was cute, but way too small.",35676,2
35676,"Sizes are not US sizes, so I ordered a size up.",35676,2
35676,XL fit like a small.,35676,2
35677,Style is ok but to big.,35677,2
35677,Nose part sitts too low.,35677,2
35677,Would not recommed.,35677,2
35678,I like it but little bit large for my daughter.,35678,2
35678,N I bought it after reading the reviews but it was not like I expected.,35678,2
35678,I returned it.,35678,2
35679,Hard to judge sizes online but this suit runs way smaller than their size span indicates.,35679,2
35679,"Small chest cups, very narrow.",35679,2
35679,Overall a super cute suit though.,35679,2
35680,didn't really provide any support,35680,2
35681,It did not look like the picture.,35681,2
35681,It's cheap and old (faded) looking.,35681,2
35682,"This dress/shirt was very cute, but there is no way I could have worn this without pants.",35682,2
35682,It is so short on.,35682,2
35682,"I'm 5'5, so average height.",35682,2
35682,"I purchased this to wear at my mother in laws surprise birthday party, 70's theme.",35682,2
35683,"Very small, print was low quality.",35683,2
35684,Nice shirt to look at.,35684,2
35684,The graphic is so thick and sticky it's very uncomfortable to wear.,35684,2
35684,Wash it to make it softer and the graphic cracks.,35684,2
35684,Fits way to big.,35684,2
35685,Not a good fit if you are short waisted...made for a slimmer torso.,35685,2
35686,"It's a cute little necklace, kind of cheap looking for the price.",35686,2
35686,Purchased for my teen daughter who has a normal sized-neck and it was too tight.,35686,2
35687,Unfortunately I wasn't able to try it on right away due to medical issues so it's too late for me to return but when I did try it on this weekend the fit was not good.,35687,2
35687,The material is similar to a thin T-shirt & the lace was uneven on the shoulders.,35687,2
35687,Also it was very tight in the chest area so if you have any sort of breasts over a small B it will look tight.,35687,2
35687,"I am not a big girl and usually fit nice in any medium shirt however this one, not so much...",35687,2
35687,I will definitely give to charity since I can't return now.,35687,2
35688,"nope, was to small",35688,2
35689,This runs large and is almost shapeless.,35689,2
35689,It was like wearing a sack.,35689,2
35690,The top fits large but the bottoms run small.,35690,2
35690,Order with caution.,35690,2
35691,dress fit okay but the boob area was way too small,35691,2
35692,"we were informed that this jacket runs small, so we ordered the next size up.",35692,2
35692,it still fit snug.,35692,2
35692,"also the quality was not best, it will not last",35692,2
35693,"Way too long to look good on someone shorter than 5' 7"".",35693,2
35693,Color was not as described.,35693,2
35694,Don't dry it in the dryer.,35694,2
35694,It shrunk dramatically after the first wash.,35694,2
35695,They were okay but they were NOT the same SIZE,35695,2
35696,The owl on the bottom fell off the 2nd day I had it in.,35696,2
35696,Now it won't screw back on.,35696,2
35697,When ordering this shirt pick a bigger size up,35697,2
35698,"For some reason it won't let me add a picture to my review to show proof, but what I recieved in the mail is NOT what I ordered from you.",35698,2
35698,Completely different style of glasses I wanted.,35698,2
35698,"I specifically ordered:
 Retro Vintage Fashion Unisex Round Arrow Style Metal Frame Sunglasses Eyewear

& instead got a Wayfarer type design.",35698,2
35698,They are not just circles like the picture portrays.,35698,2
35699,i ordered gold... Clearly states gold on the order.,35699,2
35699,i received silver,35699,2
35700,Cute shirt but fits like a junior size,35700,2
35701,The material is not at all what I expected and it is significantly shorter than it said it was.,35701,2
35701,Returned.,35701,2
35702,Cheap.,35702,2
35702,I returned.,35702,2
35702,Hated the smell of this vest.,35702,2
35702,Worked well for the Native American costume.,35702,2
35702,But too cheap and stinky.,35702,2
35703,I ordered the pink.,35703,2
35703,Not what I had expected.. definitely disappointed.. the hearts are a lot bigger and looks tacky.,35703,2
35703,Literally looks like I can only wear this on a valentine's day.,35703,2
35703,It does run small.,35703,2
35703,"I'm usually a M and went with a L, should have gone with an XL.",35703,2
35703,I have big boobs and can't button it.,35703,2
35703,(But I am also breastfeeding. ),35703,2
35703,"The length is nice and even tho a lot of people say it's cheaply made, it is but it's actually comfortable.",35703,2
35703,For $8 it's it's not horrible.,35703,2
35703,But stay away from the pink!,35703,2
35703,Unless your buying a blouse for valentine's day..,35703,2
35704,Not as expected.,35704,2
35704,Does not wear like the picture presents.,35704,2
35704,Bad material.,35704,2
35704,Takes a long time to get.,35704,2
35704,I don't ever do ratings but I had to warn about this one.,35704,2
35705,Color loos nothing like whats advertised and it fits terrible lools terrible worst i contacted the seller and i was compensated..,35705,2
35706,There was coating layers I had to peak off.,35706,2
35706,Otherwise good to go,35706,2
35707,I bought this item to wear out for my birthday dinner.,35707,2
35707,I had seen that it said it runs small already.,35707,2
35707,Usually I wore a XL so I decided to purchase the 3XL thinking that should be right.,35707,2
35707,When I recieived the package I didn't even need to put it on to know it was to small.,35707,2
35707,"Actually I couldn't even put it on, I tried and I couldn't even get it over my shoulders.",35707,2
35707,It was like I had been sent a MED even though the tag itself sure enough said XXXL...,35707,2
35707,The only reason I gave an extra star is because it really is a cute shirt.,35707,2
35707,They just fool you with the sizes,35707,2
35708,"Shabby construction, cheap material..",35708,2
35708,"They were cheap, but free is too much for junk",35708,2
35709,The straps were in an awkward spot right in the middle of your chest instead of off to the side.,35709,2
35709,The cups were also WAY too big and made it look like I had formed immovable breasts and I am a double D!,35709,2
35709,"Not a fan, I didn't feel flattering in it.",35709,2
35710,"I really liked this ring, but it only lasted about a month.",35710,2
35710,The wire in the middle holding the bead is so thin.,35710,2
35711,Not the greatest quality; ordered white and received grey,35711,2
35712,I didn't realize this was a homemade item.,35712,2
35712,The  stitch work is very poor and there are many folds  along the stitching..,35712,2
35712,The design on it is really cool so I'm going to hang in and see how it looks but I may be returning and very disappointed,35712,2
35713,"They're nice nose rings for sure, good color and whatnot, but they're way too small, and they're really hard to put in.",35713,2
35713,"My nose ring is in a very normal place, it's not too high or too low, but the rings were just a little bit too small for it.",35713,2
35713,I was really disappointed and now I don't know what to do with them.,35713,2
35713,Make sure you measure your nose before you buy the product so you're sure that it will fit.,35713,2
35714,"Quality seems nice, however I put watches in it and it would not close, and it didn't seem like it would protect the watch face very well.",35714,2
35715,"This bathing suit is really nice fits really good in the bottom, however this must've been made for a really tall woman.",35715,2
35715,The torso is too long and the top goes way above my breasts.,35715,2
35715,I'm so bummed!,35715,2
35715,Returning it would cost more that the bathing suit.,35715,2
35715,I'm going to sell it and see if at least I can get some money back for it.,35715,2
35715,"I'm 5 feet 2 inches tall and it would fit better on a  5 foot, 6 inches tall person.",35715,2
35716,Bought this for a wedding in Texas in May.,35716,2
35716,It worked great in the beginning but once I started to sweat it started to come off.,35716,2
35716,I tried to stick it again and it wouldn't so I ended up taking it off.,35716,2
35717,With in the first month a stone fell out and its uncomfortable.,35717,2
35718,It fit okay for my LG Stylo,35718,2
35719,Here goes nothing.,35719,2
35719,I tried to submit a review on this sweater before and for some reason it paired my review with a different sweater.,35719,2
35719,This sweater was shown in the sellers picture as being long and oversized.,35719,2
35719,"I'm 5'4"" 120 and I ordered a medium and it just reaches my tailbone/ top of my bum.",35719,2
35719,"It came ""new"" but has no tags stating the size, who made it, where it came from, or what material it's made of.",35719,2
35719,I was expecting it to be itchy and scratch my skin but I wore it with a tank top and I wasn't bothered.,35719,2
35719,I wish I'd read a review that told me how short it was before I'd purchased.,35719,2
35719,I was really looking forward to a big comfy oversized sweater and while it is big (falls off the shoulders) the sleeves don't come down over my hands and like I said it does not cover my butt.,35719,2
35719,I hope this review helps.,35719,2
35720,Very cheap materials.,35720,2
35721,Material is thin so you have to wear a second shirt under it.,35721,2
35721,The sleeves look more flowy but they might be a size bigger than a normal sleeve.,35721,2
35721,I would definitely order a size up.,35721,2
35722,Material was too thin for my liking.,35722,2
35723,Not worth the $12 and sadly they already broke.,35723,2
35723,Very cheap looking.,35723,2
35724,Chip material,35724,2
35725,I think the merchandise I received is a copy and not an original.,35725,2
35725,I have a original lanyard I ordered directly from Vera Bradley which has much thicker fabric and the pattern/colors matched the product image perfectly.,35725,2
35725,"The one I received from Amazon, in Sierra, does not have anywhere near the colors that were represented on the product image and the fabric is so much thinner.",35725,2
35725,"The colors on the one I received are just gross: a very bright orange, lots of brown.",35725,2
35725,"For 4-5 USD more I'll go back to the manufacturer and buy a guaranteed,  Buyer beware!",35725,2
35725,!,35725,2
35726,Way to large.,35726,2
35726,Much bigger then I expected.,35726,2
35727,"Based on the reviews, I ordered these a size larger than I typically wear (which is the largest size they offer) and they are still too small.",35727,2
35727,Really disappointed.,35727,2
35728,"This garment should be marked ""Oversized""...",35728,2
35728,"Loved the material and quality, but I would have ordered two sizes smaller to get a loose fit that didn't swallow me up...",35728,2
35729,Meh - what do expect from something like this?,35729,2
35729,"Its cheap, mailed directly from china, the material is super thin, and its a bit small.",35729,2
35729,The colors and pattern don't look nearly as nice in person as they do on the model.,35729,2
35729,But I did receive the correct pattern.,35729,2
35729,Definitely returning this one.,35729,2
35730,You can only fit a few credit/debit cards in here and two passports is tight.,35730,2
35730,I don't know about anyone else but I get to hold everyone's identification and travel papers so this does not fit everything I need.,35730,2
35731,"Nice quality but too small, I contacted the seller to exchange it or return it, and they gave me a sarcastic answer as it follows....""the mailing fee is too expensive, what about we refund you 3%, you keep it and give it as a gift to someone smaller than you""",35731,2
35732,Very uncomfortable!,35732,2
35732,Does not fit my head...,35732,2
35732,The opening is very small but the back is huge!,35732,2
35733,I have a tiny wrist and one of them broke.,35733,2
35733,I know it's not because I couldn't even get it over my knuckles because it broke.,35733,2
35733,The other two bracelets are beautiful though,35733,2
35734,My wife is a medium so I bought a medium It looked great on her.,35734,2
35734,The pin stripes are very classy.,35734,2
35734,But the lacy part scratches the skin.,35734,2
35734,If it wasn't for that she would have kept it.,35734,2
35734,She didn't want to wear something uncomfortable so she got rid of it.,35734,2
35735,Very cute but the anchor was not on straight and was bunched in two spots.,35735,2
35735,"Trying to return was impossible, so stuck with it.",35735,2
35736,"Color is not correct: very yellow, but looked beige in the description.",35736,2
35737,A bit different than picture.,35737,2
35738,These pants are made in China.,35738,2
35738,"They skimped on material, making a pant marked 36"" waist, but, just barely.",35738,2
35738,"More like a snug 35"".",35738,2
35738,"Difficult to button the pants closed, uncomfortable to have on.",35738,2
35738,"If you are going to buy a pair, size up if you hope to be comfortable.",35738,2
35738,I would not recommend these pants to anyone.,35738,2
35739,looks better on my computer ; somewhat disappointed,35739,2
35740,"A small is more like a large...
Just was not what we expected.",35740,2
35741,"The material was lovely, but the zipper on this dress broke immediately after I tried it on!",35741,2
35741,I put the dress on only once (tags still on!),35741,2
35741,and the zipper completely broke.,35741,2
35741,"I needed it for a recital performance the next day and had nothing else to wear, so I had to take it to my tailor to get it fixed.",35741,2
35741,Otherwise I would have returned it immediately!,35741,2
35741,Waste of money!,35741,2
35742,"Before purchasing this, I read all the good feedback about this bra.",35742,2
35742,"When I received it, I was excited to finally wear some cute tops!",35742,2
35742,"When I actually got to wearing it, I had issues with it sticking on top and below my breasts.",35742,2
35742,"After a couple seconds, the bra would feel like it's peeling off my skin and would leave an opening near the top of my breasts and below where it clips.",35742,2
35742,I made sure that the surface of my skin was clean and without any product.,35742,2
35743,bit small like not even my smaller friends couldn't fit in this,35743,2
35744,"Within 10 days of wear the rubber started detaching on the sides, where the shoe bends.",35744,2
35744,Totally disappointed.,35744,2
35745,"Ok product, you will be able to see through",35745,2
35746,"Ordered a small, fits like and extra large.",35746,2
35746,Fabric not flowy.. it's stiff and the button loops are weird and stretchy so opens at the bust.,35746,2
35746,If i left the top few buttons open like the model my entire chest would be out.,35746,2
35746,My guess is that this picture is a knockoff.,35746,2
35746,"The only reason for the two stars is because if you are a large with a smallish bust, and wear a slip underneath and don't expect it to flow... it could look half decent.",35746,2
35746,I just get mad when it's not as described and I waste my time.,35746,2
35746,"No picture, but I looked like I was about to start a new life in Amish country... until my boobs popped out!",35746,2
35746,lol  Use your imagination...,35746,2
35747,I can see these working for an eyebrow but don't buy them expecting them to work for a septum.,35747,2
35747,Also the ones I got were 14g not 16 as stated in the description.,35747,2
35748,"Good fit, good price, and quality product but I was sent the wrong color which I can't use and it costs too much to return.",35748,2
35749,The size runs small.,35749,2
35749,Make sure to order at least 2 sizes up.,35749,2
35749,Had to return because the bust looked pointy and felt like flexible cardboard.,35749,2
35749,The only thing nice was the bottom dress.,35749,2
35749,The chiffon flowed very nice.,35749,2
35750,wish it was softer,35750,2
35751,Well made.,35751,2
35751,Great design.,35751,2
35751,For skinny girls only!,35751,2
35751,Had to return...,35751,2
35752,"It is so small, I thought it was for a child.",35752,2
35753,Not the best quality and doesn't offer much support.,35753,2
35753,"Also if you got butt, you'll be fishing them out of your crack all day.",35753,2
35754,Top and bottom was small.,35754,2
35754,I'm about a 32dd and the top made barely covered me but the bottoms were even smaller.,35754,2
35754,The bathing suit itself was so cute.,35754,2
35754,Disappointing!!!,35754,2
35754,!,35754,2
35755,Itched my waist,35755,2
35756,These are NOT really worth the money.,35756,2
35756,They work okay.,35756,2
35756,"However, I am much more pleased with the LOX Mega-Grip Earring Backs, 2 Pair Pack.",35756,2
35757,"VERY CLAMY FABRIC , VERY THIN .",35757,2
35757,MORE LIKE SIZE10 THAN SIZE 16 / 18 .,35757,2
35757,NOT GREAT,35757,2
35758,It's cute but I ordered this twice and still got a size that's small enough to give me a wedgie-_-,35758,2
35759,I like the dress but it fits like a mid calf dress.,35759,2
35759,i will probably have to take it to a tailor to fix it because it is not long and I hate mid calf dress.,35759,2
35759,"I am 5'7"" btw and a maxi dress should not come to my calf...ugh!",35759,2
35759,I'm annoyed.,35759,2

35762,Too small and very thin.,35762,2
35762,See through.,35762,2
35762,Can't wear it unless you have another shirt under it.,35762,2
35763,The colors on the ring are off and are not at all the way they are shown in the picture.,35763,2
35763,The Rose gold is not rose gold at all.,35763,2
35763,It is just a slightly different shade of gold.,35763,2
35763,Does not match any of the rose gold I already have.,35763,2
35763,Gave it to my daughter.,35763,2
35763,Very disappointed.,35763,2
35764,"Weird fit is WAY to long does not sit like the picture, very snug",35764,2

35765,I ordered a small because I'm pretty petite.,35765,2
35765,It barely fit on the last hook and rather tight.,35765,2
35765,Update- don't like this bra.,35765,2
35765,The straps are so wide they fall off.,35765,2
35765,It makes me have terrible posture.,35765,2
35765,It doesn't support your back very well.,35765,2
35766,Size XXXL is very small,35766,2

35772,"The cumberbund thing in the middle was also way too big, covered my entire midriff",35772,2
35773,It's too big.,35773,2

35780,leggings).,35780,2
35780,"Based on popular reviews, I decided to order these, and was rather disappointed with what I received.",35780,2
35780,"Pros:

Cute, fun designs
Wide waistband (preferred for me, maybe be different for others)
Soft

Cons:

Thin
Ripped on inside (see photos)
Small (despite stretching out)
Easily snagged
Does not stay in place
Rides up
Line around the legs

First the pros.",35780,2
35780,The design was really really cool.,35780,2
35780,"Im not one that typically cares about designs on underwear (who really sees it, anyway), but the moment I took it out of the package, I fell in love with the design.",35780,2
35780,"The wider waistband was a plus, for me anyways, as it is a reassuring factor.",35780,2
35780,"The texture was really nice and sift, as well, being mostly nylon, I was expecting this, anyways.",35780,2
35780,The cons.,35780,2
35780,"Let it be known that, for the price, I was not expecting high quality clothing, but based on the reviews, I had higher hopes, thinking maybe the reviews were just a few lemons.",35780,2
35780,"Right after noticing the cute design and waistband, I noticed the thin material.",35780,2
35780,"It is very very thin, and that raised a red flag for me immediately.",35780,2
35780,"When I went to try them on, is when I noticed the snags you see in the photos.",35780,2
35780,"Thinking maybe I did this when I started to put them on, I examined the other ones.",35780,2
35780,All have the similar snag and pulls in it as the first.,35780,2
35780,"All of which, mind you, looks like runs in nylons themselves, for those that recognize that.",35780,2
35780,"Furthermore, my fingers were catching in the fabric as I was attempting to put them on, just like a pair of nylons would.",35780,2
35780,"Important to note, I have bras that are made with 92% nylon (2% more in these underwear), and this is not an issue with those.",35780,2
35780,"The size was an issue, as well.",35780,2
35780,"Granted, it does state one size fits most, but with 34 hips, I was surprised and how snug they were.",35780,2
35780,"And, of course, with that, came the fact that they were riding up, and giving free wedgies.",35780,2
35780,"For those that may wear pantyliners (whether frequently or infrequently), the riding up of these underwear forced these liners, into, otherwise unpleasant places and at odd angles.",35780,2
35780,"Important to note, which is not listed under the description, is that the lining of these underwear were not cotton.",35780,2
35780,Another issue was the label that said seamless.,35780,2
35780,"There is definitely a seam, which is around the legs of these, that is quite thick, and not something that could be missed under form fitting clothing.",35780,2
35780,"Overall, despite the soft material, colorful design and wider waistband, the snagged material, snug fit, causing riding into places unknown, will have me returning these, and looking elsewhere.",35780,2
35781,"Overall it's a good set, the smaller tips will bend easy, returning!",35781,2
35782,It's nothing the same you can see in the model,35782,2
35783,buckle fade fast  .belt good,35783,2
35784,My daughter is normal size for her age.,35784,2
35784,We ordered a medium and it was so small and so tight.,35784,2
35784,Not to mention super short.,35784,2
35785,I got what i paid for :(  Much too heavy for ear lobes,35785,2
35786,Smaller than the pictute implies and very light weight.,35786,2
35787,It's really cheap fabric.,35787,2
35787,Tight in the arms and chest and too big everywhere else.,35787,2
35787,The crochet part is all wrinkly and needs to be ironed probably each time it's washed.,35787,2
35787,It came all scrunched up.,35787,2
35787,Waste of money.,35787,2
35788,They slide down very easily.,35788,2
35788,Enough so that I had to call a fashion emergency Togo home and change in the middle of Christmas shopping.,35788,2
35789,Says it fits wide faces.,35789,2
35789,Uhhhhh.... no.,35789,2
35790,"The pattern is super cute but unfortunately the dress is WAY too small, also it does not form like the dress in the picture- it is unfortunately very boxy.",35790,2
35790,Definitely cannot wear any color underwear but nude underneath or you would see straight through the fabric.,35790,2
35791,"Looks cheap, not impressed!",35791,2
35792,Way too small and I have a small wrist,35792,2
35793,Nice but runs small.,35793,2
35793,Had to return it.,35793,2
35794,I ordered this hoodie in Burgundy but it arrived in black.,35794,2
35795,This is wayyyyy tooooo big!!,35795,2
35795,"Unless you have very large ankles, don't bother buying this!",35795,2
35795,"Disappointed as it is very pretty, but unfortunately I can't wear it!",35795,2
35795,Asked for a refund and they gave me $1.00 back.,35795,2
35795,"Wow......  Oh well, at least it was cheap enough to not lose sleep over!",35795,2
35796,This comes from China so expect it come at the very last date expected.,35796,2
35796,"It's also Chinese sizes, running quite small.",35796,2
35796,"I'm a tall girl, size 29, and I normally wear a men's small in a simple tee shirt.",35796,2
35796,"I ordered a men's medium because I wanted it to be baggier for a concert outfit, but this shirt is SMALL.",35796,2
35796,The neck is tight and it's stuck to my body.,35796,2
35796,The shirt is thin and the screen print is blurry.,35796,2
35796,Order a shirt from a more credible seller or go buy one at Hot Topic.,35796,2
35797,"For $25, it's a huge waste of money.",35797,2
35797,It doesn't hold tightly enough -- whether a large or small number of bills.,35797,2
35797,"I binder clip works better, and is what I use now.",35797,2
35798,Not too bad but received the wrong colors.,35798,2
35798,We received black suspenders and yellow bow tie.,35798,2
35798,The tie is yellow with black elastic which isn't very attractive.,35798,2
35798,We got this for my sons first birthday smash cake photos.,35798,2
35798,I tried it on him without a shirt and he was really angry.,35798,2
35798,Not usually a fussy baby.,35798,2
35798,We tried tie and suspenders separately and he also didn't like that.,35798,2
35798,Maybe too rough.,35798,2
35798,"For the price and purpose, it does the job.",35798,2
35799,"True to many reviews, this necklace does look very cheap.",35799,2
35799,"I bought mine in the rose quartz color, and it is very plasticky.",35799,2
35799,"There are small details that imitate a ""rocky"" quartz feel, however.",35799,2
35799,"The silver colored piece on the top was poorly placed, and is sloppy.",35799,2
35799,"In some places, you can see the glue that brought the ""stone"" and the silver piece together.",35799,2
35799,"But, for the price paid, its a decent product, and shipped somewhat quickly.",35799,2
35800,"waist and legs were OK, but crotch area was too tight.",35800,2
35801,Way too small,35801,2
35802,order larger than you need,35802,2
35803,Really pretty at first site but in less than a month the stone fell out.,35803,2
35804,They would not stay up and were too loose,35804,2
35805,The zipper broke on the first time I wore them.,35805,2
35805,Really frustrating.,35805,2
35806,These are NOT WOMEN'S.,35806,2
35806,The large is super large.,35806,2
35806,Very disappointed.,35806,2
35807,Gorgeous shirt but runs a bit large and is cut very low,35807,2
35808,"Material was a bit inexpensive and too small for me, order a size up.",35808,2
35809,Funny sizing.,35809,2
35809,Really tight elastic in the waist however baggy everywhere else,35809,2
35810,Not true to size,35810,2
35811,They were extremely too big.,35811,2
35811,Ended up giving them to a friend who was 6'0 and could fit them better than I could...,35811,2
35811,"I'm 5'0, 160 pounds..",35811,2
35811,I should have got a medium.,35811,2
35811,But they were very comfortable,35811,2
35812,This ring is absolutely beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.,35812,2
35812,The day it came I was so excited.,35812,2
35812,"Within minutes of putting it on, the tail bent up and I had to reshape it.",35812,2
35812,"If you will only wear it once in a while or for a special occasion this ring is ok, but not for daily wear.",35812,2
35812,The metal is very thin and easily bends out of shape.,35812,2
35812,I am returning.,35812,2
35812,"So sad, I so wanted to love this.",35812,2
35812,:-(,35812,2
35813,Looked differently than expected.,35813,2
35813,"Gets tangled on the fringe too easily.,",35813,2
35814,Shorts are very stylish.,35814,2
35814,"However, they are not made to fit international standards.",35814,2
35814,XL will fit like a Medium and XXL will fit like a Large.,35814,2
35814,"I have a 43 inch waist, 46 inch Hips, and 26 inch thigh.",35814,2
35814,XXL did not fit.,35814,2
35815,It looks big in the photo but its actually pretty small.,35815,2
35815,Be careful.,35815,2
35816,Came with a small hole.,35816,2
35816,Luckily I can sew and was able to fix it with minimal visibility.,35816,2
35816,But still...,35816,2
35817,"Very thin, can see through it.",35817,2
35818,Poor quality and really small size.,35818,2
35819,"The lights fell out while I was walking, the plastic rings that held the lights in place popped off !",35819,2
35819,!!,35819,2
35819,!,35819,2
35820,It fits and very comfy as expected but the quality is poor.,35820,2
35820,The threads were loose and 2 holes formed after a couple times of wearing it.,35820,2
35821,Does not fit 8 inch tablet like it says it does.,35821,2
35821,But very pretty.,35821,2
35822,"Not what I expected, disappointed in the quality",35822,2
35823,"It didn't fit,it was to small.",35823,2
35824,"Just out of curiosity, I bought this along with another one from Choies that had the same identical pictures (Choies was $6 more expensive.)",35824,2
35824,I sized up for both and ordered larges because I knew they ran small.,35824,2
35824,"I'm 5'5"" and I don't think either would be flattering for anyone who is much taller.",35824,2
35824,There isn't much room lengthwise in the crotch/butt area.,35824,2
35824,This one has a nude lining whereas Choies has a stark white lining.,35824,2
35824,The lace is pleated under the bust like the picture whereas Choies is not.,35824,2
35824,In addition Choies is double lined in the chest area so you have the option of wearing without a bra whereas this one is not double lined.,35824,2
35824,The one from Choies is significantly higher quality and made SO better.,35824,2
35824,"In comparison to Choies, this was sewn a lot sloppier, the fabric quality was poorer and thinner, and overall just does not seem like it will hold up as well.",35824,2
35824,The end of the one strap was not sewn closed and was fraying along with another portion of the strap.,35824,2
35824,"The zipper is in the middle of the back whereas Choies has theirs on the side, but that doesn't make any difference in terms of wearability.",35824,2
35824,"However, you can see how much sloppier the zipper was put in compared to Choies.",35824,2
35824,"Also there's a lot more loose thread on this one, like on the sides where the lace was serged together.",35824,2
35824,"Like another reviewer mentioned, the right hemline is longer than the left and for me, it was more than two inches longer.",35824,2
35824,This is the biggest reason why I am returning this.,35824,2
35824,"Perhaps, not all of them are like that but I cannot keep and wear something this lopsided and uneven.",35824,2
35824,"I give this item two stars because it seems unwearable and doesn't seem like it would last, even if it was wearable.",35824,2
35824,"At the same time, the item does look like the pictures and would be cute if the hemlines weren't so off.",35824,2
35825,I had to give it to my 12 yr old,35825,2
35826,These were a gift for my husband.,35826,2
35826,They are nice a thick and the design seems like it's not going to fade.,35826,2
35826,"I will say though that after 2 washes, they have become pretty tight even though he's a fit dude.",35826,2
35826,They're too tight for him to wear these all day without doing damage to his circulation.,35826,2
35827,Should have fit a lot better for the price.,35827,2
35827,Maybe if your xxl you should get xxxl.,35827,2
35828,Go a size up on this one.,35828,2
35828,The colour was perfect however there was no ruffle sleeve so it looks really weird.,35828,2
35829,way to small - disappointed,35829,2
35830,Not worth my money.,35830,2
35830,Donated it.,35830,2
35831,The hat is very nice.,35831,2
35831,"It is a little too bid for my head but if it like any other straw hat I have had, a little sweat and sun will shrink it a little.",35831,2
35831,The sender however shoved the hat into a box that was way too small.,35831,2
35831,Leaving the brim totally bent and lopsided.,35831,2
35831,"It took me a week of leaving it under some heavy books, those encyclopedias  came in handy for a change, to get the brim to a wearable state.",35831,2
35831,"In all if I had known how they were going to ship the hat I would not have purchased, but the hat itself is super well made.",35831,2
35832,Sizing chart was not accurate.,35832,2
35832,The skirt is too small,35832,2
35833,I ordered a large and it was still too small for my boobs.,35833,2
35833,Way too scandalous..cute suit but not for my body,35833,2
35834,"These definitely run large - I am a small in nearly every other brand of motorcycle gloves, but these had enough overlap in the finger that I took them off a mile into the one ride I tested them on because I felt less safe operating the controls while wearing them (snagged going for the brake etc.)",35834,2
35834,"Unfortunately, I have both worn them and missed the return period, so guess I'll hold onto them for passengers maybe.",35834,2
35834,"They looked decent enough, if a bit thin in the palm, but I guess you get what you pay for in the sizing.",35834,2
35835,"Holes are farther apart then the normal Iwatch bands, doesn't fit at all.",35835,2
35835,Also have to put the pins in each side.,35835,2
35835,Asked for a return but no reply,35835,2
35836,After reading the reviews I took my chances and ordered it.,35836,2
35836,"Normally, I wear a small so I ordered a large (as suggested).",35836,2
35836,If you are a size zero with B cups and a short torso this would fit perfect!,35836,2
35836,I however and not a size zero.,35836,2
35836,I looked like a stuffed sausage!,35836,2
35836,My husband had a good chuckle before I packaged it back up and printed a rerun label.,35836,2
35836,"Overall, I will give it 2 stars for the laughs and because I still think it's a cute suit.",35836,2
35836,If they got the sizing corrected I would attempt to purchase it again.,35836,2
35837,for me not too nice and useless was not like other magnetic object I used efore,35837,2
35838,was ok.,35838,2
35839,Got it January 9 2016 today is April 25 2016.,35839,2
35839,It is literally falling apart.,35839,2
35839,Strap and zippers broke and it's coming un-stitched.,35839,2
35839,It looked amazing when I got it but it's poorly made.,35839,2
35839,Sad thing about it..it was part of my Christmas and I'm stuck with it.,35839,2
35839,Very disappointed.,35839,2
35840,The dress is a MAJOR difference from what the picture shows and what you get.,35840,2
35840,From just looking at the neck line you can only assume it is a thick sparkly strap of some sort.,35840,2
35840,It's not.,35840,2
35840,It is silver not that dark gray.,35840,2
35840,And it is thin and scratchy overall.,35840,2
35840,"The dress material was nice and pretty the neck line looks cheap and put together rather then the ""glamourous and red carpet"" look as described and shown.",35840,2
35840,Purchase if you want an low income fancy dress.,35840,2
35840,Not something I would wear.,35840,2
35840,It looks cheap just like how it was.,35840,2
35841,They are HUGE and snag on everything.,35841,2
35841,They look dangerous when you put them on.,35841,2
35842,The design is Amazing!!,35842,2
35842,But sadly the shirt is way to big I'm an XS and this shirts a medium or large.,35842,2
35842,And its made out of 88% polyester 12%spandex.,35842,2
35843,hangs down,35843,2
35844,Looks ok but the quality is cheap.,35844,2
35844,Disappointed its not of better quality.,35844,2
35844,The dial turns loosely it seems like it's going gloop off any given moment.,35844,2
35844,My daughter wears it but says it uncomfortable.,35844,2
35844,She has to wear to school for time learning lessons.,35844,2
35845,"I suspect this dress was made in China...it is substandard, poor craftsmanship, thin, cheap material.",35845,2
35845,"Very sheer, even with the half slip lining.",35845,2
35845,Would not be caught dead wearing this in pubic.,35845,2
35845,Could be used for a night gown?,35845,2
35845,Just a waste of money....and runs small.,35845,2
35846,DONt!!!!!!!!,35846,2
35846,Do itttttt,35846,2
35847,My package arrived today and it doesn't look at all like the picture.,35847,2
35847,I ordered a Xl but it fits like a med.,35847,2
35847,I gave it 2 stars because it was fast shipping,35847,2
35848,Pretty dress but too large.,35848,2
35848,Not keeping it.,35848,2
35849,The robe is fine.,35849,2
35849,The nightgown is probably a medium (but marked XX).,35849,2
35849,It's a lot better on paper than in person.,35849,2
35850,Wore it once and tossed it out.,35850,2
35850,you get what you pay for.,35850,2
35851,Small small small,35851,2
35852,"This item was cute and I love it because it's so handy, but after only a few uses, it broke.",35852,2
35852,"I cannot close it anymore, so it's useless to me.",35852,2
35852,I guess you get what you pay for.,35852,2
35852,Really wish they replaced broken ones because I love this case despite the fact that it  broke.,35852,2
35853,I didn't like the dress sizing was off and I didn't like the padding for built in bra it made the dress look stiff,35853,2
35854,Advertised as 2XX...,35854,2
35854,This shirt should be appropriate for a woman wearing size 18.,35854,2
35854,"However it is so small, I'd be surprised if it would fit a size 10.",35854,2
35854,"Color is very pretty, material is nice.",35854,2
35854,..service was fine....none of that matters when product is not as expected.,35854,2
35855,too small on top down to my ankles,35855,2
35856,This is a nice ring.,35856,2
35856,It's pretty standard.,35856,2
35856,I'm only giving it two stars because the stone fell out after a couple of days.,35856,2
35856,It was easy enough to glue a new one on though.,35856,2
35857,It was very small,35857,2
35858,It's not big enough to hold cash (american currency).,35858,2
35858,Its a little cumbersome to open as well.,35858,2
35859,Not the same coat and no belt.,35859,2
35860,Size runs extremely small,35860,2
35861,The style is old-fashioned.,35861,2
35861,I hate wearing these kind of suits.,35861,2
35862,I bought 2 of these - one set is already broken.,35862,2
35862,The pearl separated from the stick.,35862,2
35863,You can see threw the dresd,35863,2
35864,Overall pretty poor quality.,35864,2
35864,Emblem off center to brim.,35864,2
35864,Large and non-adjustable.,35864,2
35865,normally,35865,2
35866,manageable,35866,2
35867,"Very sheer fabric, I would only wear under a dress or very long shirt.",35867,2
35868,I was very excited when I ordered this shirt for my son as he loves the show Peppa Pig as well as trains.,35868,2
35868,"Unfortunately, the shirt that we received is not navy & red but instead black & hot pink.",35868,2
35869,FAIR!,35869,2
35870,The belt looks really good at first.,35870,2
35870,"After just a few wears though, I noticed the brushed metal had gotten a bunch of small scratches on it.",35870,2
35870,"I've just been in an office while wearing it, and can't imagine how such light use after a few wears could have already caused scratches on the buckle.",35870,2
35870,"Great belt other than that though, too bad it already looks bad.",35870,2
35871,Unfortunately we're gonna be sending them back their too small nowide enough,35871,2
35872,Meh!,35872,2
35872,I didn't like it.,35872,2
35872,Looks cheap....,35872,2
35872,It doesn't come in the box that the pictures show.,35872,2
35873,Cheap appearance.,35873,2
35873,Reflects price.,35873,2
35874,Quality of the sewing was not very good.,35874,2
35874,had to return.,35874,2
35875,It's way too small!!!,35875,2
35875,It smelled like cat spray as soon as I opened the bag.,35875,2
35876,The shirt smells like fumes and neckline was too small barely making around my neck.,35876,2
35876,I measure myself before ordering and still get this snug at the bust line.,35876,2
35876,The material wringles when i sit and looks like i was sleeping by the end of the day.,35876,2
35876,the color was the only positive  point.,35876,2
35876,I went to Van Hausen and get a size down M for $17 and was immediately surprised with the difference in fit and quality.,35876,2
35877,"lace is silky, but stiff... the arms are very baggy.",35877,2
35877,the neck comes up much higher than shown on the model.,35877,2
35877,shirt is baggy all around.,35877,2
35877,"overall, it looks like a cheap costume.",35877,2
35877,will be returning.,35877,2
35878,The chain on this necklace broke immediately.,35878,2
35879,I liked the idea of a plastic clip but I was a little disappointed in theses.,35879,2
35879,Not very rigid and clip does not open very far to allow clipping to something as big as the clip is.,35879,2
35879,"Not worthless, just could have been a little better.",35879,2
35880,Way too heavy.,35880,2
35880,They took a blonde pigtail wig and stitched in the colored pieces.,35880,2
35880,They don't blend together at all and it makes the wig very heavy since they didn't remove any of the original hair from the blonde part.,35880,2
35880,The pigtails droop badly (worse than pictured) due to the weight.,35880,2
35880,The colored bits are scraggly and not full-looking as pictured.,35880,2
35880,The size of the wig is HUGE.The temple pieces completely cover my ears.,35880,2
35880,I guess I should've known from the pic but I guess I figured the wid head in the picture was small like they tend to be.,35880,2
35880,No.,35880,2
35880,This thing is huge.,35880,2
35880,Why is it so big??,35880,2
35880,I have 10 other wigs by various makers and this is super-sized compared to the rest.,35880,2
35880,The sizing issue makes this unwearable for me.,35880,2
35881,"I have a pair of ETO jeans i have been wearing for years (in fact I'm wearing them this very moment) that are a size 32R, which is my regular size.",35881,2
35881,Since the old pair is starting to go I decided to order a few new pairs in the exact same size.,35881,2
35881,"For some reason, they are unbelievably small.",35881,2
35881,"Small around the waist, small around the calves, they were far too difficult to put on.",35881,2
35881,And unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to pay for shipping to return the other two pairs I ordered because they didn't include prime and I have a feeling they won't be fitting either.,35881,2
35881,"Very disappointing, as I was really looking forward to wearing these pants for the next few years.",35881,2
35881,:(,35881,2
35882,"I really wanted to love this dress but when your chest is on the larger size, especially when pregnant or nursing, it most likely won't fit.",35882,2
35882,I tried both the M and the L and both were showing too much of the ladies or my bra.,35882,2
35882,I had to return.,35882,2
35882,FYI I'm a 36DDD.,35882,2
35883,I ordered two sunglasses and had to return them because both pairs the nose pad was not aligned with the frame as much as i tried to adjust them to fit my face they would always look cricket.,35883,2
35884,Looking at the picture you would think you could tuck this in.,35884,2
35884,"I'm 5""10', 165 lbs and I couldn't tuck it well.",35884,2
35884,There was also string coming off one of them like crazy.,35884,2
35885,"UPDATE 8/9/16
The zipper for the inner pocket broke.",35885,2
35885,BTW it still smells.,35885,2
35885,"This wallet should get 5 stars BUT when it arrived, it smelled horrible.",35885,2
35885,I left it out for days to air it out.,35885,2
35885,"Even now, there is still a bit of a smell.",35885,2
35885,I googled what it could be and some sites said it was leftover from the tanning process.,35885,2
35885,You can buy leather soap to really get it out but I'm too lazy for that.,35885,2
35885,The functionality of this wallet is amazing.,35885,2
35885,"It can hold all my cards, ID, money, change AND I get my phone in there and it snaps closed.",35885,2
35885,I like this wallet.,35885,2
35885,I would have loved it if not for the smell,35885,2
35886,Fits as expected.,35886,2
35886,Love the color.,35886,2
35886,Looks great over the dress in bought if for.,35886,2
35886,Great buy,35886,2
35887,It's cute but was too small,35887,2
35888,"I ordered a small and it was way too big, I'm pretty sure I got the wrong size",35888,2
35889,"Too big for my wrist, seemed like it was made of cheap material :/",35889,2
35890,The material wasn't what I expected.,35890,2
35891,Great quality just waay to small if you have a brpad chest.,35891,2
35891,I need to take it get altered or ship my xl back for 2xl when i usually wear a large,35891,2
35892,"Looks pretty, but with the regular use, loose the color!",35892,2
35893,WAYYYY to smalllll,35893,2
35894,Too big.,35894,2
35895,Creative design elastic string broke within a week though.,35895,2
35896,Design looks like it was blown up too big and is kinda blurry as a result.,35896,2
35896,Bag feels flimsy like the zippers aren't going to last very long.,35896,2
35896,It's also kinda small.,35896,2
35896,I bought this to hold binders for school and it absolutely can't handle that job.,35896,2
35897,The button broke off the first time he tried it on.,35897,2
35897,It would be good for disposable Halloween outfit if it were not so expensive.,35897,2
35897,Should have got one from JCPenneys.,35897,2
35897,Same price better quality,35897,2
35898,FRAGILE,35898,2
35899,Too small and product is not true to picture shown,35899,2
35900,My daughter is on the slim side and these shoes were too wide for her foot.,35900,2
35901,"at first i was impressed, loved the design, and i have had no problems until a couple of days ago.",35901,2
35901,the hinge that holds it together is starting to not close correctly.,35901,2
35901,it starting to slide out of place.,35901,2
35901,i think i'll be returning this product.,35901,2
35901,"It's a shame, i really want to like it.",35901,2
35902,Originally I purchased the large and they were way too small.,35902,2
35903,"Beautiful dress however, if you are bottom heavy and/or have a wide back...this dress will not give at all",35903,2
35904,If you go from sitting to standing often this seems to roll down/up and definitely needs to be adjusted often.,35904,2
35904,I thought I had sized incorrectly but that was not the case.,35904,2
35904,Ultimately it was worth just investing in a couple pair of pregnancy slacks/jeans to be comfortable and not have to worry about fidgeting with this band constantly.,35904,2
35905,Too big and heavy I can't stand it,35905,2
35906,Cute for the first wear but the pads disintegrated in the wash.,35906,2
35906,"If you plan on wearing without pads, then this will probably work okay for you.",35906,2
35906,I also had one of the straps come loose but it was easy enough to fix.,35906,2
35907,I usually wear an 8/10 so ordered xlarge.,35907,2
35907,"Fits over hips and top but is short and flimsy material..will use,as a nightshirt.",35907,2
35908,Starts falling apart after the first wash.,35908,2
35909,These are NOT WOMEN'S.,35909,2
35909,The large is super large.,35909,2
35909,Very disappointed.,35909,2
35910,Got this shirt and it was super cute until I tried it on.,35910,2
35910,The sleeves are not form fitting like it shows in the picture.,35910,2
35910,I like my sleeves to hug my arms especially from elbow to wrist and this was baggy but not in the cute style sense.,35910,2
35911,The glasses look nice and came with a little carrying bag.,35911,2
35911,"At first glance, they seemed well made.",35911,2
35911,"However after only a little over a week, one of the hinges broke.",35911,2
35911,I take good care of my sunglasses and was disappointed they broke so easily and without being under any kind of duress.,35911,2
35911,I recommend looking to other brands with similar styles and better manufacturing.,35911,2
35912,No good,35912,2
35913,I am giving this product only two stars.,35913,2
35913,This is due to the little rubber grips on the toe part of the socks have worn down after only one or two washes.,35913,2
35913,"I was using them for my pilates class where we are on a mega reformer, so we are on our toes a lot, and these just did not keep the grip that you need for the class.",35913,2
35913,"Since I have 4 of them, instead of throwing them away, I decided to cut off the toes and will use them for yoga until the other part of the grips wear down.",35913,2
35914,Loved these when they came in the mail.,35914,2
35914,Super comfy and cute.,35914,2
35914,"I bought them to use in indoor pools (because of an injury on my foot), but I only wore them for 30mins ONCE and they're damaged.",35914,2
35914,You can see several holes forming and they've grown a hairdo ;).,35914,2
35914,Don't think it's going to take long at all before there will be a real hole in it.,35914,2
35914,Also they are super slippery IN the pool.,35914,2
35914,I'd never expected that.,35914,2
35914,Super disappointed :( I would like a refund to be honest.,35914,2
35915,So I washed them gentle cycle.,35915,2
35915,Air dry.,35915,2
35915,Holes appearing already.,35915,2
35915,2 washes no dryer.,35915,2
35915,"Bad product even worse

Much thinner than it appears on this site
Have to wear socks under this sock slipper to keep toes warm in winter.",35915,2
35915,Pretty but thin.,35915,2
35915,"Would prefer thick and ugly

Very disappointing
Also non skid bumps on foot of sock only on front pad of sock rather than the entire bottom

I have a pr of similar style slipper socks from several years ago.",35915,2
35915,"Those old slipper socks were comfy and thick and plush
Not even related to these airy the socks

Even after many wash and dry cycles those old socks are far warmer and have more "" bumper pads""
  Keep looking
Very reduced quality

Pretty but poor quality.",35915,2
35915,"Don't expect these socks to hold up long term
Prompt shipping",35915,2
35916,"Cute, but the high waist is really high and the wrap around has no padding and doesn't really hold your ladies well.",35916,2
35917,Nothing like i thought it was going to be.,35917,2
35917,WAY smaller than pictured.,35917,2
35917,Wont be buying another one.,35917,2
35918,Nice but too big and postage to China is too high so exchange is not an option,35918,2
35919,I don't think the stones are a 1/3 ct.,35919,2
35919,They seem to be closer to a 1/4 ct.,35919,2
35920,The dress is completely see through.,35920,2
35920,The only way wear it is with a slip.,35920,2
35921,Super see through and tight!,35921,2
35921,They're okay to wear underneath something but you could wear them like they show in the picture!,35921,2
35922,Poor quality.,35922,2
35922,Way too small!,35922,2
35922,It was not even near being below the knee.,35922,2
35922,It was more like a mini dress.,35922,2
35923,Gave it to my daughters,35923,2
35924,"Arrived a little before predicted date, but did not fit.",35924,2
35924,Will donate it to someone in need because I used a gift card.,35924,2
35925,The pearls fell out after a few times wearing them.,35925,2
35925,Cheap.,35925,2
35926,The products are cute but the quality is lacking.,35926,2
35926,Two of the three items were broken within 48 hours.,35926,2
35926,The seller was great about replacing the broken item and we were able to reconnect loose jewelry links on the bracelet.,35926,2
35926,"If you are looking for something that's going to last awhile, I don't think this is the right product for you.",35926,2
35927,It's too small but I don't have the time to be returning things,35927,2
35928,It was broken.,35928,2
35928,They said I would get a refund to my discover card but I used my cash back rewards so I didn't get a refund.,35928,2
35928,It is a very nice crown except it wasn't welded in one place.,35928,2
35929,"Does not look like the picture...the pic looks like it's a a variety of pastels- when in reality, it's bright, harsh colors.",35929,2
35929,The yellow is almost fluorescent.,35929,2
35929,"Not overly impressed and I would return it but unfortunately, it came from CHINA, so it's not even worth my time.",35929,2
35930,I hit this is broken fast to,35930,2
35931,The top was a bit too large and the bottom seemed to be too tight.. not a good mix for me :/,35931,2
35932,Way shorter than expected.,35932,2
35932,"Has huge buttons with the word ""rico"" on them.",35932,2
35932,Nice fabric though.,35932,2
35933,"The Tiara itself is nice, but the clip on the front that holds it to your hair came off immediately.",35933,2
35933,It was for my daughter's Sweet 16 and she wasn't able to wear it.,35933,2
35933,I'll be returning this item.,35933,2
35934,"Loved the necklace, wish the stone wasn't chipped...",35934,2
35935,You get what you pay for.,35935,2
35935,This is poorly made and something you cannot wear often because of the poor quality.,35935,2
35936,Way too small and no stretch to it at all.,35936,2
35937,The fit was different from the other shirts I purchased from Hugo Boss directly.,35937,2
35937,"Also, there is no sewn in tag on the torso of the shirt like there is with the shirts I purchased directly from the store.",35937,2
35937,I am wondering if these are counterfeit fake knock offs?,35937,2
35937,"The package has a sticker slapped on it that says ""new fit"" which seems very sketchy considering Hugo Boss does not change their fit.",35937,2
35937,"Its either slim fit, regular fit, or extra slim fit.",35937,2
35937,"And that if they wanted to modify the fit, they would call it something else or just make a new product line.",35937,2
35937,So I am assuming these are knock offs.,35937,2
35937,"They are the same price directly from the Hugo Boss store so I think I will just buy them from the store and see if the store is selling this ""new fit"" now too or not.",35937,2
35938,"The dress is beautiful and fits well; however, I ordered it for a wedding that I am in and the color pictured is completely different than that of the dress.",35938,2
35938,I don't usually write reviews but this is something that the buyer should be aware of.,35938,2
35939,Too small,35939,2
35940,"This outfit is definitely adorable, but NOWHERE near fitting my newborn.",35940,2
35940,I bought the 0-3 month outfit and he DROWNED in it at 6 weeks.,35940,2
35940,But I also don't think it would fit a 3 month old either.,35940,2
35940,It looked more like a 2 year old should wear it.,35940,2
35940,:(,35940,2
35941,"Picture was misleading at the time, although now that I'm back out here, they've changed it.",35941,2
35941,"I bought this expecting fold-over wing-tip collars (seamless, the wing tips are just part of the collar, pressed and folded over).",35941,2
35941,"Instead, I received the cheapo-version, with the little fake triangle-tip collar bits that are sewn onto the rest of the collar.",35941,2
35941,I'm usually a 16 36/37.,35941,2
35941,Got the 15.5 36/37 because the last shirt I had was too big in the neck.,35941,2
35941,"Even with this size, the neck was too big, and the sleeves were too short.",35941,2
35941,"To make it worse, the shirt shrank after the first wash and hang dry.",35941,2
35941,I ended up pitching this shirt after two uses.,35941,2
35941,"Ignoring the misleading picture, still rating this low.",35941,2
35941,Good luck.,35941,2
35941,Your mileage may vary.,35941,2
35942,"Although the length of the skirt and the denim quality is good, the skirt is too big around the waist.",35942,2
35942,"I am 5""3', 130 lbs.",35942,2
35942,"Usually, size 12 or L clothes fit me just fine.",35942,2
35942,But not this skirt.,35942,2
35942,I will have to gift it away.,35942,2
35943,not what I expected,35943,2
35944,The jacket was INCREDIBLY small...,35944,2
35944,I purchased a large and it is the size of a US extra small.,35944,2
35944,"The quality of the jacket seems to be nice, but I cannot wear it.",35944,2
35944,"The seller has been very unhelpful in returning, offering a mere 15% money back and allowing me to keep the item (which is of no use, I physically cannot fit into the thing).",35944,2
35944,"Would be alright for children, I suppose, but not grown adults.",35944,2
35945,"With summer coming and the pools and beaches calling, I have been gathering up the essentials for fun in the sun.",35945,2
35945,"Last year I learned the hard way that wearing your day to day slip-ons to any water activity is not a good idea, nor is it smart to not wear anything.",35945,2
35945,This year I wised up and looked for water socks to wear in the sand or poolside.,35945,2
35945,"The good:
- These water socks are very comfortable.",35945,2
35945,"They fit snug, but not tight.",35945,2
35945,"I wouldnt go so far as to say feels like being barefoot, but they don't feel like bulky shoes.",35945,2
35945,- They fit perfectly when using the size chart.,35945,2
35945,"For reference, I am a size 6 1/2 womens and I ordered a large.",35945,2
35945,- They are cute.,35945,2
35945,I like that they are basic black and are very low cut.,35945,2
35945,- Price is reasonable.,35945,2
35945,"- Non slip surface on the bottom
The bad:
- They don't last.",35945,2
35945,I have had them for less than a month and already the seams are breaking apart.,35945,2
35945,"I have worn them 4 times, haven't used them on rough surfaces (I put my shoes on over them when walking to and from) and I keep my toenails short so I am not sure why they would be coming apart so soon.",35945,2
35945,"So, as much as I like them, I would not re-purchase them nor would I recommend them.",35945,2
35945,"I break it down like this...I paid $9.99 for them, got 4 uses out of them before they started breaking apart, thats $2.50ish per use.",35945,2
35945,Seems a little high.,35945,2
35945,"No disclosure needed - I am a reviewer of Amazon products and often get things at a discount, however this item I have bought at FULL price for my own personal use.",35945,2
35945,Thank you for reading my review!,35945,2
35946,Cracked stone.,35946,2
35946,The metal flowers stick up and will catch on clothing.,35946,2
35946,This is a good seller which I have dealt with before and will again.,35946,2
35947,They seem thin and cheap to me.,35947,2
35947,I didn't like the fit & feel.,35947,2
35948,Stones FALL OUT!,35948,2
35948,6 months later and I am missing 2 tiny stones.....It was pretty,35948,2
35949,Too small,35949,2
35950,Not the same as they used to be.,35950,2
35950,They changed the way they make their flip flops and they don't fit the way I like.,35950,2
35951,Pretty but ridiculously too tight - sizing is crazy,35951,2
35952,This is the worst material ever this was waist of my money!!!!!,35952,2
35952,Do you not buy this unless you want to buy a piece of rag this is so thin you can see through it.,35952,2
35953,This item runs very small.,35953,2
35954,Way small,35954,2
35955,Looks way better in the photo - looks like a cotton-like yarn.,35955,2
35955,"Red looks tomato-y in the picture, but what I received looks more like an acrylic fiber yarn grannies homemade hobby piece with leftover Christmas yarn.",35955,2
35955,"Not happy, especially at this price.",35955,2
35955,Never again.,35955,2
35956,I was disappointed in the volume.,35956,2
35956,"It is very flat but, for the price, I didn't bother to pay tp send oit back.",35956,2
35957,"Low quality, but it works for what it is.",35957,2
35957,"I expect it to rip any second, honestly.",35957,2
35958,not whats pictured.,35958,2
35958,im petite 4'11 and this goes a few inches past my hips.,35958,2
35959,The shades have a nice design and can do the job.,35959,2
35959,The major problem is that is too small.,35959,2
35960,Zipper malfunction/broken.,35960,2
35960,Returned it for refund.,35960,2
35960,Bummer.....I didn't have a chance to use it yet.,35960,2
35960,Nice color.,35960,2
35961,This is very comfy to wear all day and all night.,35961,2
35961,"Fit was great, especially at first.",35961,2
35961,But after about 5 days this folds and bunches and really doesn't seem to function as intended anymore.,35961,2
35961,That's very disappointing considering how $$$ it was and also considering I was hoping to wear this 5-6 weeks.,35961,2
35961,I'm not sure this will survive structurally for much more than a week.,35961,2
35961,"And yes, I have the right size... yes, I'm a bit flubbery all the way around... but this product is intended to be used post-pregnancy so the target consumer will be all of these things!!",35961,2
35961,I expected better.,35961,2
35962,These are huge.,35962,2
35962,"I thought they'd be cute & fun, but they're so over-sized they look like joke glasses.",35962,2
35963,things where so big even though I got what is typically tight fit on me and the shoe was so loose I had a hard time getting my foot out of the clips.,35963,2
35963,When I turned my foot out the shoe just flexed and twisted on my foot.,35963,2
35964,I can't believe they would claim these are a size 'large'!,35964,2
35964,I always wear a large unless I order from Roaman's which are always 2 sizes larger than I wear...Don't buy a size large because after you open the bag...it's tag says it's a size 18/22!,35964,2
35964,A typical X-Large isn't even this big!,35964,2
35964,"They wouldn't pay for my shipping costs to return them (in the small box I was returning them in) and that cost was $3 more than the pajamas themselves, so needless to say, I'm stuck with pjs that I can't even wear!",35964,2
35965,Cute but cheap.,35965,2
35965,Bracelet is all bent and won't flatten out.,35965,2
35966,Received the bracelet a day late.,35966,2
35966,.was suppose to be a two day deliver and turned into three.,35966,2
35966,Got it in time to leave for my trip though.,35966,2
35966,The bracelet is very pretty and the charm are really nice.,35966,2
35966,I was unhappy about the quality of the bracelet.,35966,2
35966,When you adjust the bracelet to put it on.,35966,2
35966,.it was a struggle and because I have a large wrist there was no way it was going on!,35966,2
35966,I also noticed that from where I adjusted it to put it on you could see the metal was darker in those spots.,35966,2
35966,.not silver looking like the rest of the bracelet.,35966,2
35966,Pretty bracelet but in time I know it will turn meaning the silver plated color,35966,2
35967,"Nothing like the picture... more like a black and blue heather, and very cheap.",35967,2
35967,So disappointed that I wasted money on two of these sweaters.,35967,2
35968,"Alright, I REALLY liked this wallet a lot at first.",35968,2
35968,"However, after about six months of using it.",35968,2
35968,"The plastic card older inserts tore, rendering it useless because cards fall out upon opening the wallet.",35968,2
35968,"And now, recently, the metal clap has stopped working and I only carry 5 cards in there.",35968,2
35968,"The claim to honor a limited lifetime warrant on this wallet, but after four attempts to contact their support e-mail address...",35968,2
35968,I received no response.,35968,2
35968,Buyer beware.,35968,2
35968,"It's a fine product, but it will not last and the company will just ignore you.",35968,2
35968,I won't be buying a replacement.,35968,2
35968,I'd rater support a company tat cares enough to honor their policies and responds to customers.,35968,2
35968,Very unhappy.,35968,2
35968,Waste of money  Amazon won't even help me out by sending me a replacement.,35968,2
35969,This dress was at least 2 sizes too small.,35969,2
35969,I couldn't wear it.,35969,2
35969,It is a very pretty dress though.,35969,2
35970,Order one size larger than you wear.,35970,2
35971,These are very soft and comfortable but the material is too thin.,35971,2
35971,They ripped during the 2nd wash,35971,2
35972,"It was pretty cheap, so I didn't expect much, but yeah it wasn't very good, and it was uncomfortable.",35972,2
35973,This is much smaller than I expected.,35973,2
35973,I have not used it and probably never will.,35973,2
35973,I really should have immediately returned it.,35973,2
35973,"Clothes that I can fold in half and lay flat in a 22""carry-on DO NOT fit and lay flat in this.",35973,2
35973,So why would I ever use it?,35973,2
35973,"On the other hand, it is very light weight and the shape of the handle gives you a flat bottom with no ridges, which is nice.",35973,2
35973,I have a large IT suitcase of this structure and I love those two features.,35973,2
35973,"I just wanted something a larger than carry-on size, which is usually called 24""or 25""",35973,2
35974,"Heavy frames, more for men, not what I expected.",35974,2
35975,The shirt had a stain on it.,35975,2
35976,Did not expect the headband to be neoprene.,35976,2
35976,Edges are unfinished.,35976,2
35977,Stitching is horrible,35977,2
35978,"I ordered a large, and it was more like a XXL.",35978,2
35978,"The printed so was cute, and I liked it.",35978,2
35978,The style T-shirt is great.,35978,2
35978,But way too large.,35978,2
35979,Bought a second one for my boyfriend and its late :/,35979,2
35980,Very disappointed cheaply made but that is what you get for the price,35980,2
35981,Took weeks to be delivered and was way too short.,35981,2
35981,This is meant to cover a bathing suit and it did not.,35981,2
35981,"I am 5'7"" 135 lbs and it barely covered my bottom.",35981,2
35981,Not worth the hassle of returning.,35981,2
35981,My fault for ordering something that ships from China.,35981,2
35982,Didn't meet my expectation...too small and i thought it would have been more glossy like the pic...,35982,2
35983,The pictures and the item is different,35983,2
35984,not real silver!,35984,2
35984,turned my neck green!,35984,2
35985,size was too big///,35985,2
35986,This bra is way to small.,35986,2
35986,I wear a size D cup and it fits like B.,35986,2
35986,May be good for smaller chested women.,35986,2
35986,I really wish it was the right size.,35986,2
35987,Loved the fabric and design on it.,35987,2
35987,However the dress was way too short even when it was in my correct size.,35987,2
35987,Unfortunately I have to return it :(,35987,2
35988,Not the material I thought it would be.,35988,2
35988,Too clingy,35988,2
35989,"Poor construction, the stitching across the back actually stitch one piece of fabric together in a small section.",35989,2
35989,it is quite noticeable.,35989,2
35989,Did like the fit of jacket though sendibg it back,35989,2
35990,This item did not fit and I got it a size larger than my size I will be returning this item soon,35990,2
35991,"Cute, fabric feels cheap :/  will work as beachwear",35991,2
35992,Terrible material,35992,2
35993,Though I like the bag it doesn't look anything like its pictured!,35993,2
35994,Beautiful piece bit chain is too long and the ring doesnt stay straight.,35994,2
35995,Cheap,35995,2
35996,The sizing for this shirt is off considerably.,35996,2
35996,"I normally where a 2xl in men's shirts, but this was more like a large.",35996,2
35997,inferior fabric,35997,2
35998,Not very satisfied.,35998,2
35998,I was expecting the strap to be alot longer.,35998,2
35998,I was not long enough to be categorized as a cross body bag.,35998,2
35999,Ordered a large and received medium.,35999,2
35999,This is my second order.,35999,2
35999,Will return and order the next size.,35999,2
35999,Hope the third time will be ok. Like the Dirndle though.,35999,2
36000,This was NOT an infinity scarf.,36000,2
36000,I'm keeping it because the material is soft & I can wear it as a scarf or a shawl.,36000,2
36001,it's pretty but not what I expected.,36001,2
36002,"Quality appears good, but fit is too small for a 13-15 USA size.",36002,2
36003,no thank you,36003,2
36004,Good concept but half the cup size!,36004,2
36004,Why is it so difficult to make a larger cup size for the clear back concept!,36004,2
36004,!,36004,2
36005,A yoke style waistband that doesn't stay up.,36005,2
36005,I'm a size 10 and have to constantly pull them up.,36005,2
36005,Love the print but wish they fit like the others I bought.,36005,2
36006,The cap of the hat does not fit the bill too much material,36006,2
36007,Cheeks were hangin out,36007,2
36008,I was very disappointed when I received this product.,36008,2
36008,Online it looks like some cute shorts but in reality they suffocate you.,36008,2
36009,"The shorts were too short for my fat ...
My bad
Not the fault of the seller.",36009,2
36010,The length and the fabric was fine the size is way too small and it's not flair like the shows in the picture,36010,2
36011,cheap see thru material,36011,2
36012,"It is too big than I expect.it is red not yellow like the picture.when I received, it was not ok missing one stone.",36012,2
36013,Very sheer and the arms are a little baggy.,36013,2
36013,I ordered my regular size.,36013,2
36013,If I ordered a size down my stomach would show.,36013,2
36013,I'll keep it as a PJ top I suppose,36013,2
36014,"Very cute, but too large.",36014,2
36014,Hard to keep from falling down in front of eyes.,36014,2
36015,"This is a nice design, but of course, as everyone should already know.. when you order from overseas, don't set your expectations very high and don't expect to get anything quickly.",36015,2
36015,"I was able to squeeze into it to try it on, but wouldn't trust it to actually wear swimming.",36015,2
36015,The material is so thin and it's a crappy sewing job.,36015,2
36015,The buttons actually hang by a thread.,36015,2
36016,"Not child size,at all",36016,2
36017,"Disappointed, plan to return it.",36017,2
36018,Super cute color.,36018,2
36018,I was looking for a bright orange & blue and this is the only pair I found.,36018,2
36018,The fit was perfect according to the chart.,36018,2
36018,I had to return it because on the first day of use it caused me pain while wearing them for 10 hours at work.,36018,2
36018,The wheels also didn't go very far at all.,36018,2
36018,Maybe 3-4 feet before they started slowing down.,36018,2
36019,Cute buy way too small,36019,2
36020,"Arrived quick but my clasp was welded shut, got a refund for it!",36020,2
36021,I had to give it too my daughter.,36021,2
36021,I ordered a size up and it was still too small.,36021,2
36021,"Also, the gold ""necklace"" thingy was hanging by a thread, so just pulled it off.",36021,2
36021,Won't buy from here again....at least not for me,36021,2
36022,Way too small.,36022,2
36022,"These are really pretty, but are not wearable.",36022,2
36022,Make sure you are on the low end of the range that this should fit.,36022,2
36023,I ordered this bag thinking it was larger but it wasn't big enough for meme.,36023,2
36023,I'm not rating the bag on its size I'm rating it based on the fact the zipper keeps coming of the track.,36023,2
36024,Hardly any compression.,36024,2
36024,Returned,36024,2
36025,The under portions fit fine but the sheer dress was stitched without any possibilities of stretching.,36025,2
36026,This sweater is so scratchy I can't even wear it.,36026,2
36027,Fits small,36027,2
36028,Used a little small,36028,2
36029,I love the dress ...it was to big,36029,2
36030,"I actually nvr tried this on, it was SO ridiculous looking in person.",36030,2
36030,Awful!,36030,2
36031,"Comfortable, but too big and the colors are much duller than pictured.",36031,2
36031,It looks faded.,36031,2
36031,"Also, I didn't like that it doesn't have a breakaway zipper so you have to step into it rather than just slip it on.",36031,2
36031,"If you want to get this, purchase it smaller than you think you need.",36031,2
36031,And don't expect the pretty bright colors you see.,36031,2
36032,"Fit a preteen, 'nuff said.",36032,2
36033,Material not what I wanted,36033,2
36034,"Watch is very nice, big bezel, stylish time piece with a lot of character.",36034,2
36034,Reminds me of a Diesel at a 1/4th of the price.,36034,2
36034,"The reason I gave item a bad review, watch was sent to me not working properly.",36034,2
36034,"Second hand stopped and started when it wanted, causing the time to be way off.",36034,2
36034,"After resetting for the 4th time, item had to be returned.",36034,2
36034,"Better luck next time, The saying you get what you pay for rang very loud in this scenario.",36034,2
36035,Not recommend this shoe at all.,36035,2
36036,"broke really really quickly, but arrived quickly and looked like we thought it would",36036,2
36037,The chest area was way too big for me at B34.,36037,2
36038,The dress was made out of good material for the price.,36038,2
36038,"Unfortunately, it was extremely too short.",36038,2
36038,The top portion fit perfectly but the split came up to my bottom.,36038,2
36038,"I am 5'7"" 34B in the bust area.",36038,2
36038,Hips and thighs are curvy and athletic.,36038,2
36039,Way too small.,36039,2
36040,"Style is nice, but need a wide offering",36040,2
36041,Color scrapes off easily,36041,2
36042,"Cute concept and shirt, however im usually a medium in shirts but i figured cause its japanese sizing (atleast it seems so) that id order a larger to be safe.",36042,2
36042,"The shirt itself wasn't tight , fight fine.",36042,2
36042,Howver the sleeve was way tight and i could barely move my arms.,36042,2
36042,Cute but yeah too small,36042,2
36043,"The material, quality, and construction is all great, however I've had to buy three different pairs all the same size to get one that fit right.",36043,2
36043,"I wear a 34x30 and first pair the waist was waaay to tight, second pair waste was perfect, length was too short, and third pair fits just right.",36043,2
36043,"Love them when I find ones that fit, but easier to buy them in store so you can try on  multiple pairs",36043,2
36044,"Arms were super tight, but otherwise the fit was good.",36044,2
36045,This dress is very flattering.,36045,2
36045,"However, 2 stars because mine came with a defect.",36045,2
36045,There was a rip in the seam large enough for my fingers to go through.,36045,2
36046,I don't know if my product was defective  but I've had it for 3 months and it broke already.,36046,2
36047,I was disappointed with the shirt.,36047,2
36047,"The fabric was thin, the colors faded from the first wash before even my daughter wore it, and it fit small.",36047,2
36048,"looks different from the pic, it is gold thread not a lace applique.",36048,2
36048,stretchy material and not cotton.,36048,2
36048,had to go up to an xl when I am a medium.,36048,2
36048,I will keep it cause it looks better on then in the package.,36048,2
36049,I'm disappointed in this item.,36049,2
36049,Its much too large (very wide) and cheap material.,36049,2
36049,The print is blurry and low quality.,36049,2
36049,I plan on returning the item because the cost is way to high this quality of a product.,36049,2
36050,"Was nice but tore really easy, but was really cute just ripped easy",36050,2
36051,Extremely uncomfortable.,36051,2
36051,I bought 2 pairs for my daughters to start off the school year with.,36051,2
36051,Epic fail.,36051,2
36051,I was called down to the school before lunchtime to deliver new shoes.,36051,2
36051,The shoes are very stiff and hard and rubbed terribly against their heel and sides that they received blisters and raw marks from them.,36051,2
36051,"The only reason this got 2 stars was they were pretty, delivered timely and appeared exactly as seen in photo.",36051,2
36052,Fits as expected but the sleeves are super awkward.,36052,2
36052,Shirt does NOT have pockets it is just sewn weird so you can put your hand there.,36052,2
36052,"You could absolutely not put anything in the ""pocket"" your hands will hardly even fit.",36052,2
36052,Decent price but I'm planning on giving the shirt away because it is not what I expected.,36052,2
36053,Jewels came off first wear,36053,2
36054,Loved it but it was too small for my ankle.,36054,2
36055,Should've known I wouldn't look like the model lol.,36055,2
36055,I gave this shirt away bc it just didn't look good on me.,36055,2
36055,"Might look good on a petite frame, but not so cute on someone with curves.",36055,2
36055,I am 5'7 and 155 lbs.,36055,2
36056,"Don't buy this top, cheap material and only worth 1.00 dollar.",36056,2

36057,"If you're looking for a ""tacky"" or ""gaudy"" look then this is your piece.",36057,2
36057,"If you're looking for elegant and classy, don't buy this.",36057,2
36057,It was made well and arrived in one piece.,36057,2
36057,Very heavy tho.,36057,2
36058,Runs really small and seller would only offer a partial refund vs returning it for full refund.,36058,2
36059,bad.,36059,2
36059,they broke after a week.,36059,2
36059,got ray bans instead,36059,2
36060,You get what you pay for.,36060,2
36060,Cheaply made.,36060,2
36060,Short in the arms and baggy everywhere else.,36060,2
36060,Took three and a half weeks to arrive.,36060,2
36061,The fit is too small.,36061,2
36061,I wear xl to 2xl.,36061,2
36061,There is no way this is true to size.,36061,2
36062,Too small sending back but made nice...,36062,2
36063,The front looks like the picture and sizing is accurate.,36063,2
36063,"However, the bow on back is just a jumbled mess of material that is bright pink and dark blue stripes and doesn't match.",36063,2
36063,Would be cute if the bow was as it looks in the picture and was RED white and blue.,36063,2
36064,Too large.,36064,2
36064,For really rotund bottoms.,36064,2
36065,Deceptive on line...ugly looking bag,36065,2
36066,"I am normally a medium, good thing i ordered a large just in case.",36066,2
36066,Very poorly sized,36066,2
36067,Shirts shrink a lot.,36067,2
36068,It's very pretty.,36068,2
36068,"However, even for polyester it feels cheap and is rather stiff and rough.",36068,2
36068,"Also, the static on it is very annoying.",36068,2
36068,But it makes sense.,36068,2
36068,Not expensive and made in China where quality is very rare.,36068,2
36069,"Sexy, body-hugging ""work"" dress surprised me this is labeled for work.",36069,2
36069,"But then again, I guess it depends on what you do for work!",36069,2
36070,It looks cheap and poorly made,36070,2
36071,One wash and the decal already started peel.,36071,2
36071,Very disappointing.,36071,2
36071,The tshirt it's self is great.,36071,2
36072,cheap,36072,2
36073,Not what I expected.,36073,2
36074,too stiff gave blissters,36074,2
36075,A few of the earrings broke just getting the plastic posts off and majority of the backings do not stay on.,36075,2
36075,"Other than that, they're ok, at best",36075,2
36076,"Bottoms fit ok, but the top was way too small",36076,2
36077,These socks are not as XL as I expected them to be.,36077,2
36077,My husband has size 13 shoes and these socks don't really fit him!,36077,2
36078,They look great and fit perfectly.,36078,2
36078,"My husband is 6'2"" with a 32"" inseam, and the size L is perfect.",36078,2
36078,"The problem with these pants, which he didn't realize until the packaging was in the trash, is that they have no fly!",36078,2
36078,"So in a public restroom he has to pull down his pants to go in a urinal, which he doesn't like at all.",36078,2
36078,"No where in the ad does it say there is no fly and you cannot tell from the picture, either.",36078,2
36078,He loves the pants except for this one aspect of them.,36078,2
36079,very thin and see through.,36079,2
36079,Must wear a long shirt to cover.,36079,2
36080,Too small and too short,36080,2
36081,Looks as cheap as it was so I can't be mad!,36081,2
36081,"Not worth returning but, don't like...probably never wear.",36081,2
36082,"The black part of the pants feel soft, almost like a microfiber.",36082,2
36082,The gray part is a rougher feeling fabric.,36082,2
36082,"Because of the dark seam that goes through the middle of the pants, it outlines your labia (giving you ""camel toe"").",36082,2
36082,Because there is no specific front side or back side (there is no extra fabric for a butt) the pants in the back will dip very low and the pants in the front will go above your belly button.,36082,2
36082,"These pants are constantly sliding down, so you can either have them falling off or have a constant camel toe.",36082,2
36082,There is no elastic or anything in the waist band to hold them up.,36082,2
36082,"These would work for just lounging around, but don't try doing any kind of actual physical activity (like yoga...which is what these pants are advertised for), because they will keep sliding down.",36082,2
36082,These are definitely my least favorite pair of leggings.,36082,2
36083,Very thin material and did not fit.,36083,2
36083,I followed the measurements on the chart and it was still too small.,36083,2
36083,I'm returning,36083,2
36084,"Not a bad belt, but there is a bit of a learning curve as to how to operate it.",36084,2
36084,"At least for me, and I never thought I was dim-witted.",36084,2
36084,But who knows?,36084,2
36084,Perhaps I am.,36084,2
36085,It sits funny and it's itchy.,36085,2
36086,It's all tangle and not very useful.,36086,2
36087,I had to return it because it runs so small.,36087,2
36087,I am by no means a big girl and the x-large just didn't work.,36087,2
36087,I saw others say it ran small so I bought a size up and it still was too small.,36087,2
36087,Had to buy a bathing suit that fits normal size people.,36087,2
36088,I got a XXL and I wear a 16 up top  and a 12 on the bottom and my legs could not even  fit in the jumper.,36088,2
36089,These were too large and too long.,36089,2
36089,"I got xtra large because I like my pants loose, but these were way to big and also very long.",36089,2
36089,I'm hoping they will shrink when I wash them in hot water.,36089,2
36089,(Not worth the trouble of returning them).,36089,2
36090,"The design was pretty but had marks on the ""leather"" right out of the packaging.",36090,2
36090,Definitely wouldn't hold up as my everyday handbag.,36090,2
36091,Totally see through!!!,36091,2
36091,Now my daughter wears it for dress up...,36091,2
36092,Size chart is not accurate.,36092,2
36092,Ended up ordering a size that was way too large.,36092,2
36092,I returned it and am still waiting for my refund.,36092,2
36092,I ordered a second one in a smaller size that fits better.,36092,2
36092,The shirt is cotton but not breathable.,36092,2
36092,Do not wear outside on a hot day.,36092,2
36093,"WAY, WAY, WAY too small!",36093,2
36093,I got this as a gift and I can't even close it.,36093,2
36094,Very cheaply made.,36094,2
36095,These panties run very large.,36095,2
36095,I ordered a size 8/XL which is what I normally wear.,36095,2
36095,"In another order, I mistakenly ordered a Bali panty in a 9/2XL.",36095,2
36095,The Ellen Tracy panties are considerably larger than the Bali 2XL.,36095,2
36096,It doesn't fit the way it is shown in the picture.,36096,2
36097,I'm not happy with this product at all.,36097,2
36097,"I was really looking forward to using this rolling bag, but the handle does not stay locked in position and when I  push the bag rather than pull, the handle collapses.",36097,2
36097,"It also becomes very front heavy even when I put my heavier items in the back, so it is always falling over.",36097,2
36098,Bad quality,36098,2
36099,Im glad I didn't pay much these are great foe age 5.,36099,2
36100,Felt like I was wearing a muumuu.,36100,2
36101,I ordered this for my Asus ZenWatch 2.,36101,2
36101,"I really like the look and feel of this band, and it fits well onto the watch.",36101,2
36101,"However, the clasp (at least on the unit I got) was horrible.",36101,2
36101,"It would hold for a bit, but then as soon as I would shift my wrist around it would come undone.",36101,2
36101,It comes off about every 10 times in a given hour in daily use.,36101,2
36101,"It might just be my unit, but I'm getting a different one.",36101,2
36102,Gave away to a teen.,36102,2
36103,MATERIAL VERY FLIMSY.,36103,2
36103,"PICTURE LOOKS LIKE WHITE, WHITE MATERIAL BUT IT IS VERY SHEER AND COMES ACROSS NOT SO WHITE LOOKING.",36103,2
36103,I WOULDN'T PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN.,36103,2
36104,I'm a pretty small person and they only had a small and that usually works for me but this was too big.,36104,2
36105,does not shape well,36105,2
36106,Gave it to my daughter as it was way too small.,36106,2
36107,Ordered this online to possibly wear with a skirt but it was too big -- I ordered it the same size that I normally wear but it was loose in the chest and way to big in the stomach.,36107,2
36108,"Dose not hug curves as pictured and cuffs around thigh area, definitely ok for lounge wear...",36108,2
36108,Dose not fit like pictures,36108,2
36109,Alot smaller than expected.,36109,2
36109,And the straps are crappy and short,36109,2
36110,Too small.,36110,2
36110,Look good on an small person,36110,2
36111,One size fits a size zero.,36111,2
36112,There is no elastic.,36112,2
36112,And no space to even wear belt.,36112,2
36112,Very unfortunate cos it made my legs look good,36112,2
36113,clasp broke after a week.,36113,2
36114,I followed other people's suggestions for ordering.,36114,2
36114,"I wanted a large, so I ordered a 2x.",36114,2
36114,It turned out to be closer to 1x.,36114,2
36114,I was disappointed that most  of the flowers were on the back and the front was mostly just leaves.,36114,2
36115,washed once and faded only in spots..not all over...,36115,2
36116,These shoes are poorly constructed and I don't expect them to last more that one summer.,36116,2
36116,"Would not recommend, and will not order another Nike downshifter series again",36116,2
36117,Outfit runs large.,36117,2
36117,Was unable to wear it.,36117,2
36118,very poor quality.,36118,2
36118,I actually got laughed at after opening the package and showing a friend.,36118,2
36119,"I ended up returning these because the bottom of the frame touched my cheeks, I wouldn't recommend these for people who have that issue with sunglasses.",36119,2
36119,The sunglasses were lightweight and the color was nice but I got the feeling these were fake.,36119,2
36119,The case looked a bit suspect.,36119,2
36120,"I bought these as exercise pants and they are very thin, but the band doesn't fold over.",36120,2
36120,The pants were shipped promptly and I received them in good condition.,36120,2
36120,"For the same price, there are better alternatives to these pants.",36120,2
36120,"For me, the inseam is short and the pants are about mid-calf or just a bit lower.",36120,2
36120,"I was expecting longer pants, but I don't mind this length.",36120,2
36121,Good quality but too small.,36121,2
36122,"Break really easy and on some the balls don't fit right, not bioplast.",36122,2
36123,"The dress is pretty and very soft, however the tank portion where your boobs are to fit is rediculously sized.",36123,2
36123,I bought a large (in reality I could have picked a medium) but the top portion goes midway down on my boobs.,36123,2
36123,I wear a 36D so I don't know if they size this to women with small chests but it looks funny because this part should come to the bottom of your chest.,36123,2
36123,Luckily my grandmother is great at sewing and we sewed a new tank to the top and it wasn't a waste of money.,36123,2
36123,Not sure I'd buy this brand of maternity wear again.,36123,2
36124,Glad I can sew.,36124,2
36124,I bought this for my husbands birthday and it did not fit whatsoever.,36124,2
36124,Way to small.,36124,2
36124,"As a joke I put it on and we laughed that it looked awesome on me, I am a size 10-12 (ordered a 42) and I did need a belt.",36124,2
36124,I folded it away.,36124,2
36124,Months later I wore it to go out to the bar.,36124,2
36124,"It ripped on the sides, which was surprising as I had to wear a belt with it.",36124,2
36124,"Came home and threw it into the ""mending pile"".....",36124,2
36124,I pulled it out of my sewing pile months later to stitch it up and realized the sewing on this kilt is TERRIBLE!!,36124,2
36124,My kids sew better.,36124,2
36124,Most of the seams do not come together.,36124,2
36124,"The belt prong holes are not reinforced, just slits in the fabric.",36124,2
36124,I am going to reinforce it by sewing over the bad seams.,36124,2
36124,"It looks cool and it is fun, but if you want a kilt that is gonna hold together, spend the extra money and buy something worthy.",36124,2
36125,Colors all wrong ...,36125,2
36125,Doesn't match the painting.,36125,2
36125,Thin material.,36125,2
36125,"On positive side, handled return well.",36125,2
36126,"The dress was not made well the bra part barely covers anything,  the zipper is difficult and very fragile.",36126,2
36126,It is stretchy in some areas but in the areas it needs to be stretchy it is not.,36126,2
36126,I'm very disappointed with this purchase but with return shipping costing so much it is not worth returning.,36126,2
36127,"When I got these capris, I really liked them.",36127,2
36127,"They looked great with so many tops, and they were so comfy.",36127,2
36127,"I wear a 6/8 or M in most clothes, and I found the M to be a little big, but overall I was happy.",36127,2
36127,After four times wearing them.,36127,2
36127,a HUGE hole formed along the seam in the back.,36127,2
36127,That is unacceptable after four wears with hand washing and air drying.,36127,2
36127,I contacted the company and they basically told me I was out of luck.,36127,2
36127,How can a company sell pants that fall apart that quickly and do nothing to replace or refund?,36127,2
36127,Buyer beware!,36127,2
36127,You get what you pay for.,36127,2
36128,Way too short and tight even though I ordered two sizes larger than what I normally wear.,36128,2
36128,The neon yellow is actually neon green.,36128,2
36128,Better fit for a petite person.,36128,2
36129,I'm giving it 2 stars only bc I ordered an extra small & received a medium,36129,2
36130,zipper got stuck and then teeth fell asleep off,36130,2
36131,"Five stars for its potential as a bigger wallet, but the small size undermines an otherwise flawless aesthetic, making it generally unsuitable as a ""wallet"" for men.",36131,2
36131,"Handling it in person, I felt like I was handling a woman's product and I just ended up feeling silly carrying it on me.",36131,2
36131,"The wallet lives up to its proposed function, carrying most essentials, albeit tightly, but I don't really feel that the Card Pocket actually qualifies as a true ""wallet"" experience.",36131,2
36131,"It's the size of a small coin purse and, frankly, that is exactly what it looks like.",36131,2
36131,"My guess is that ""coin purse"" just didn't have quite the right ring for attracting a male consumer base.",36131,2
36131,But calling something a wallet doesn't change the fact that it is indistinguishable from a coin purse.,36131,2
36131,"And don't take my word for it, everyone I showed this wallet to thought it was a coin purse.",36131,2
36131,"Furthermore, it is on the small side of coin purses, which is probably why most of the people I interviewed also thought it was a woman's accesory.",36131,2
36131,"When I first saw the pictures, I felt like I finally found an alternative to my Note Sleeve, as I have been wanting to get a Bellroy zipper wallet for some time.",36131,2
36131,"However, I was totally let down when I finally got to handle it in person.",36131,2
36131,"Again, think: petite coin purse.",36131,2
36131,"It's my feeling that zipper wallets work well as a male accessory if they establish themselves as actual wallets, not too big, not too small, designed for regular handling.",36131,2
36131,There just isn't enough of the Card Pocket there to make handling it an enjoyable experience.,36131,2
36131,It's hard to explain but I just couldn't convince myself that it was a wallet and that is a very big problem.,36131,2
36131,I felt like I was missing something from my life.,36131,2
36131,"I didn't realize until purchasing the Card Pocket, that men must form relationships with their wallets, like a security blanket; beyond the obvious security of credit cards, IDs, etc.",36131,2
36131,"In the end, I went back to the Note Sleeve, which I honestly consider the best wallet on the market, by a large margin.",36131,2
36131,"Bellroy is still the top company out there, but I think the Card Pocket represents a missed opportunity.",36131,2
36131,"If Bellroy could only match the dimensions of the Note Sleeve with the zipper function, they would have a real winner.",36131,2
36131,I anticipate that such a design isn't too far down the pipeline?,36131,2
36132,came with a hole in the butt...,36132,2
36133,it fits but the catch is too small and it keeps dropping of my hand.,36133,2
36133,the quality of the bracelet to bad.,36133,2
36133,I say this because I purchase the necklace from guess store in Canada and it's much heavier.,36133,2
36134,Not the right style for my body.,36134,2
36134,Not for someone with a belly problem.,36134,2
36134,Very unflattering silhouette.,36134,2
36135,way smaller then the size says am pretty disappointed,36135,2
36136,I ordered a large and it was smaller than expected.,36136,2
36137,"it's not the pink in the picture, it's bright, hot, neon pink!",36137,2
36137,:(,36137,2
36138,"Wore it once, funny and cute but it shrunk after one wash and I didn't put it in dryer.",36138,2
36138,I had read reviews so I bought XL since it ran small but didn't work.,36138,2
36138,I wear a Medium!,36138,2
36138,"The XL fit like a Medium, but not after a wash!",36138,2
36139,- a slimmed-down version of the mad bomber hat.,36139,2
36139,I was disappointed that the hat seemed not so thick and warm.,36139,2
36139,"For those who want just the styling, it's okay.",36139,2
36139,"For those wanting maximum warmth and wind resistance, spend a little more for the Mad Bomber",36139,2
36140,US 8/10 should be a medium/large or even a small/medium NOT a large/XL.,36140,2
36140,Not fun getting a Christmas gift in the wrong size and unable to get the correct size in time for the holiday!,36140,2
36141,I loved this shirt unfortunately it was too small.,36141,2
36141,I'm a standard 6/8 Tara and long.,36141,2
36141,"I ordered a large because of previous reviews, hoping for a good fit.",36141,2
36141,"However, I was very disappointed.",36141,2
36141,Also to arm sleeves appeared to be sewn backwards.,36141,2
36141,I wish this was available more tailored.,36141,2
36142,I ordered a size larger than I usually do and was still too small.,36142,2
36142,It fits but not comfortably.,36142,2
36142,"I ordered a L, and I usually wear a size 6.",36142,2
36142,I gave it to my size 2 niece and fits her pefectly,36142,2
36143,The short is ok but the top is really tight for a 36 C/D.,36143,2
36143,quite disappointed.,36143,2
36144,Cute dress but smells extremely bad!,36144,2
36144,I am still debating whether returning this item because of that.,36144,2
36145,You can barely see what it is.,36145,2
36145,So small.,36145,2
36146,"Got it for my Fiance, shipping took almost a month but my lady is in love with it so all is good.",36146,2
36146,"8/12/16

Well, the purse is falling apart.",36146,2
36146,The piping is just letting go of its bond.,36146,2
36146,Will not be getting one of these again for my wife.,36146,2
36146,She won't carry it now that it's falling apart.,36146,2
36146,She loved this purse now it sits in the closet.,36146,2
36146,There should be some kind of warranty on something such as this.,36146,2
36147,"Had belt eleven months, and the leather belt thread on top and bottom, is coming apart.",36147,2
36147,"I wore the belt, every day in a office environment.",36147,2
36147,So now I am looking for another belt different brand .,36147,2
36147,"The buckle and slider on the belt works great, not a problem ever.",36147,2
36148,Front was narrow and it created a gap under my arms showing lots of side boob.,36148,2
36148,"Cute shirt, just not a good fit",36148,2
36149,I don't like the material and the color.,36149,2
36149,They look crass and cheap.,36149,2
36149,It is on my giveaway pile.,36149,2
36150,"Perhaps I ordered a size too large, but I expected these to fit more snugly.",36150,2
36150,"They ride up in the middle, so they don't work so well for me.",36150,2
36150,"I do, however like the pattern and the shipping was very fast.",36150,2
36151,These earrings are of very poor quality.,36151,2
36151,I didn't even try them on because they looked so bad:(,36151,2
36152,Wrinkles very easily.,36152,2
36152,Looks sloppy.,36152,2
36153,Quality is not all there and if it's too small definite not worth the money,36153,2
36154,"No buttons, no zippers.",36154,2
36154,"It says ""stretch"" but does not stretch at all.",36154,2
36154,Absolutely no give.,36154,2
36155,Sizes run bigger and material is not of high quality.,36155,2
36156,Nice print but the wallet itself came in damaged.,36156,2
36156,The leather was really scratched up.,36156,2
36157,"Although I usually really like Allegra K items, this one is the first one I've ever actually returned.",36157,2
36157,"The sleeves were short and didn't even look like 3/4 sleeves, they just made it look like my shirt didn't fit.",36157,2
36157,"Also, it was SUPER thin.",36157,2
36157,"If it wasn't white then I would just wear an undershirt, but even with a tank top underneath you could see my skin tone some and that would not be appropriate at work for me.",36157,2
36157,"On the plus side, I liked the black buttons on the white shirt and it had a good length and fit otherwise.",36157,2
36158,Order a size larger than you are as the shirt shrinks quite a bit in the wash.  Not the highest grade t-shirt.,36158,2
36158,Won't buy from this company again.,36158,2
36159,"Decent shirt but it is a ""slim"" cut.",36159,2
36159,"I wear 2XXL and that is what I ordered, but this shirt is too tight.",36159,2
36160,Way too small,36160,2
36161,The material is like a nylon type material.,36161,2
36161,It's nowhere near as long as the one in the picture.,36161,2
36161,It's only comes right past my waist.,36161,2
36161,It also runs very small so you might better order 2 sizes larger than your regular size.,36161,2
36161,"It is a beautiful shirt tho, no tears or anything just wished it was bigger and longer",36161,2
36162,The version I received of this shirt has the print reversed with the flowers on the bottom and the stems on top.,36162,2
36162,Making it really bad is the fact that the material starts over leaving abrupt lines similar to those shown on the sleeves across the front and back.,36162,2
36162,"In the back, the white line highlights my rump - something most middle aged women don't want or, need to have further protracted.",36162,2
36162,"All in all, it's not representative of the photo and though the company, which I must say is very responsive to all inquiries,  has stated they will replace with a better likeness upon the shirt's return, I am extremely unhappy that I have to go to the trouble.",36162,2
36162,"Would have been ecstatic had it arrived as shown, however.",36162,2
36162,It's very pretty material and the buttons and button loops make the style absolutely adorable.,36162,2
36163,Very tight around top ..,36163,2
36163,Runs smaller than what the say size shirt is,36163,2
36164,"I like the costume, I'm 5'4"" 112 lbs and ordered the small which fits well.",36164,2
36164,"The fabric is not awesome, but is not as sheer as others I tried (like the stormtropper one) and it has the cape which is a good thing to have.",36164,2
36164,"I like the fit, and the ""helmet"" is more like a mask, that's better for me, not like I'm gonna wear it the whole time but I won't be sweating like I would if it was a real helmet.",36164,2
36164,"Overall I would say I love it for the price, and my kids think I look super cool, but pretty at the same time :) my problem is with the vendor.",36164,2
36164,"First the costume didn't arrive the day was supposed to, and all I got was ""we are sorry"" and then you could tell the package was opened before and arrived incomplete, the belt is missing, I called Amazon right away but they won't send me another one because it's from a 3rd party, and it was ""just the belt"" (excuse me, but the belt of a jump suit is extremely important) all the offered was a $6 discount and now I have to figure the way to make a belt, (with $6 for supplies I guess) for tomorrow =/ my advice is get the costume, buy somewhere else",36164,2
36165,"Bracelet was EXTREMELY large, required bending to be able to even stay on my wrist!",36165,2
36165,Also was much rougher and cheaper appearing than in the photos.,36165,2
36165,"I purchased a name-brand version of this bracelet that came in a 3-pack of plastic versions and, despite being made of PLASTIC, those look like they are much higher quality than this bracelet.",36165,2
36165,Would not purchase again.,36165,2
36165,"Also, the opening to hold a hair tie in this bracelet is larger than I would have liked, there is plenty of room for the hair tie to move around and it does not fit snuggly.",36165,2
36166,I was SO disappointed by these...I wanted to love them!,36166,2
36166,"They have a nice-feeling material, I loved that you get a pack of 5, and once I was able to hoist my 36DD bust into them and get the zipper done, they were actually relatively supportive (I'd say low to medium impact, there was certainly bounce)...HOWEVER.",36166,2
36166,"3 out of the 5 were never even able to stay zipped (zipper just undid itself from the bottom instantly) and the other two I wore once, then the next time I tried to zip them, the zipper broke.",36166,2
36166,"If you're a B or smaller I imagine they might work better---but TRUST ME, these zippers do not stand up to big boobs.",36166,2
36167,Liked how it look when ordering  but it comes small and it's to  see-through from private areas so not much coverage on your butt area nor the front ...,36167,2
36167,Didn't like it .,36167,2
36168,Was not happy to see they were more of a spandex than a faux leather.,36168,2
36168,I normally wear a size 12.,36168,2
36168,Bought size large and they were too big in the legs.,36168,2
36168,I definitely have to wear knee high boots to cover up the looseness in the lower legs.,36168,2
36168,A medium probably would have been a better fit.,36168,2
36168,They are thin and a tunic shirt is a necessity with these leggings.,36168,2
36169,Cheap but expected for the cost.,36169,2
36170,"The materials feel cheaper than most $10 sunglasses I've bought, but they're $10 so I can't really fault them for that.",36170,2
36170,The biggest problem I have is the excessive glare these sunglasses experience.,36170,2
36170,I generally just take them back off.,36170,2
36170,I can see better squinting.,36170,2
36171,I wasn't paying attention so didn't realize it was satin.,36171,2
36171,"It's a pretty print, butsatin doesn't excite me.",36171,2
36171,The breast cups look oversized and Did not fit me well.,36171,2
36172,"good quality leather, very nicely made but too thick, not pliable enough and the zipper failed the very first time I put it to use.",36172,2
36173,I knew these were made in China so I ordered a size larger but they were still too small.,36173,2
36173,Love the underwear but can't wear because they hardly cover my cheeks.,36173,2
36173,They end up in my crack!,36173,2
36173,"Also, you'll wait a good month or more for them to arrive.",36173,2
36174,Way too small,36174,2
36175,Had lots of strings hanging and not as think as it looks more paper thin.,36175,2
36176,Sad that they were huge for my 12 month year old .,36176,2
36176,Its made for more like a 5 year old.,36176,2
36177,Day 2 and one of the buckles that holds the duffel bag tore and that does it for me.,36177,2
36177,"Great features, probably zero tolerance to normal use?",36177,2
36177,There are other options out there.,36177,2
36178,"Ordered a large, and ended up giving it to a friend who wears a small.",36178,2
36179,I just didn't like the look of this when it arrived.,36179,2
36179,Way better in the photo on the listing.,36179,2
36179,Stitching was cheap looking.,36179,2
36179,"The fabric was only stretchy ONE WAY, and it's not the way you need it to stretch.",36179,2
36179,"It stretches down, not width ways.",36179,2
36180,Cute shirt but definitely the wrong size.,36180,2
36180,I ordered a 2x and its more like a small or xs...,36180,2
36181,Too busy big also  unthreaded when arrived,36181,2
36182,The stone was really cheap and cloudy looking.,36182,2
36183,Needed newborn size ...it was too big and did not fit 3 month good front too narrow to cover diaper.,36183,2
36184,Digital hard to setup,36184,2
36185,Not the greatest fit for my body type wore them once and will probably pass on,36185,2
36186,the bottoms fit great but the top is very questionable.,36186,2
36186,"with a tube bra you can create another style, but not the one shown.",36186,2
36186,My top half isn't as fluffy as the girl in the photo and I still can't do much with the top!,36186,2
36187,Not true to size.,36187,2
36187,"Maybe for petites or juniors, not misses.",36187,2
36187,If it fit it would of been very nice for my occasion.,36187,2
36188,"cheap metal, levers bend to easy and break",36188,2
36189,"This is a Vinyl Purse, NOT Leather, as stated in some of the reviews.",36189,2
36189,"It is also almost a ""brick"" red, not as bright as the picture indicates.",36189,2
36189,"Definitely a ""Fall"" season purse.",36189,2
36189,I miss the signature D & B  braided zipper pull to and should have splurged on a leather Tote instead.,36189,2
36189,"This inside is a cheesy red vinyl, not an attractive color, instead of D & B's signature red fabric.",36189,2
36190,Item to small no stretch,36190,2
36191,"Design is cute, but the fit is way off, the neck scoops because it is way too big.",36191,2
36192,Not that great,36192,2
36193,Not the same as they used to be.,36193,2
36193,They changed the way they make their flip flops and they don't fit the way I like.,36193,2
36194,This is very cheesy eve glass.kdont recommend to get one.,36194,2
36195,Was not what I expected!,36195,2
36196,Very disappointing quality.,36196,2
36196,The elastic broke on both boots after my daughter wore them for a day.,36196,2
36196,She plays hard but for $30 I expect the boots to last.,36196,2
36196,Returned and got a completely different pair (with actual laces and a zipper).,36196,2
36197,:-(,36197,2
36198,The dress itself is super cute and very comfortable.,36198,2
36198,"However, like every other buyer has said it runs small and isn't sewn as a maternity dress.",36198,2
36198,"I'm quite small, I typically wear a size zero and xs in most store items - when I'm not pregnant.",36198,2
36198,Currently I am 3 months pregnant and barely showing at all.,36198,2
36198,"This dress is super tight and I'm afraid, although cute, will not get me much past my 4 month mark.",36198,2
36198,"It's a great non maternity dress, perhaps even after baby dress, but as a maternity dress I only can give it two stars.",36198,2
36199,Didn't look like the picture,36199,2
36200,Have purchased other leveret pajamas and did not have a problem.,36200,2
36200,"However, this item has a hole in the heel part of the foot after only two washes.",36200,2
36200,The fit is as expected.,36200,2
36201,To big and was really see through,36201,2
36202,Not what I expected,36202,2
36203,These are very cute and I got many compliments on them.,36203,2
36203,But.. after a few times wearing them and about 3 washes the rivets fell off and there were holes next to the seam in the crotch.,36203,2
36203,I had to return them.,36203,2
36204,Size is not god!,36204,2
36205,Okay hat....to small for my large head I guess.,36205,2
36205,#ToDamnTight,36205,2
36206,Just did not fit like other pants I have bought that had a drawstring.,36206,2
36207,"Although it is totally my fault for not realizing I ordered a large instead of small this robe for ""kids"" still seemed way too big.",36207,2
36207,Not happy with the quality of the robe at all.,36207,2
36208,"Very, very thin with a paper texture.",36208,2
36208,"My daughter wanted this and she was disappointed when she got it, but at least the size was decent.",36208,2
36209,I did not like the way the severity of cloth and detail,36209,2
36210,"This is a well made, high quality pant in many aspects.",36210,2
36210,"Unfortunately, as with many products now days, no one seems to pay attention
to the total product, and specifications are not given on the rise.",36210,2
36210,"The rear rise is quite skimpy, very short.",36210,2
36210,With every step the legs pulls in an uncomfortable way.,36210,2
36211,"5'4"" 34c after reading the reviews I ordered an XL but it was still too small.",36211,2
36211,This top is not as in the pic but can pull off as a cute fitted crop top.,36211,2
36211,It is so small that it is not loose as in the pic and it doesn't have the sweetheart cut to the front as in the pic.,36211,2
36212,This was not a shawl it was a scarf,36212,2
36213,"I purchased this same item from another retailer, and the quality and fit way surpassed this suit.",36213,2
36213,I returned it.,36213,2
36214,I disliked it because it wasn't long enough to the floor like it was on the picture but overall it was ok,36214,2
36215,The idea is great....But the helmet fits adults better than a child.,36215,2
36215,My child ended up carrying the helmet for Halloween because it was WAY too big for her head.,36215,2
36216,"Poor quality T-shirt, cheap and hard.",36216,2
36216,The shirt is stiff.,36216,2
36216,And the shape gives the impression of form fitting but it's not.,36216,2
36216,On the other hand the lips look exactly as featured.,36216,2
36217,"Very pretty, but cheaply made.",36217,2
36217,One of the charms broke off within 15 minutes of wear.,36217,2
36218,The star fish falls off after wearing one day :/,36218,2
36219,Leather was to good cheap leather,36219,2
36220,Way too thin.,36220,2
36221,"It is cute to look at, but it runs too small; maybe because of the sheer lining inside of it.",36221,2
36222,no way is this a hoodie.,36222,2
36222,fits small,36222,2
36223,Good material...,36223,2
36223,BUT..,36223,2
36223,The moment I put it on and tried to zip it up the zipper fell apart into my hand.,36223,2
36223,So now no zipper.,36223,2
36223,"Than when I attempted to place my hands into the pockets, imagine my surprise to when only one hand would went in.",36223,2
36223,One of the pockets was sewn shut.,36223,2
36223,Well to be fair not all the way.,36223,2
36223,"Was enough room provided for me to insert a thumb, or any one finger, if I should find the need to keep one finger warm at any given time.",36223,2
36223,I suppose I could rotate.,36223,2
36223,Would NOT recommend buying from this company.,36223,2
36224,Arrived Tarnished.,36224,2
36224,"It's cheap jewelry, and you get what you pay for...",36224,2
36225,I read that this swimsuit runs one size too small.,36225,2
36225,I decided to order a medium and when I got it the damn thing was too large.,36225,2
36225,top and bottom didn't fit.,36225,2
36226,The brass ring attached to strap rust !,36226,2
36226,!,36226,2
36226,It is not made of brass.,36226,2
36227,Good colors and quality but too very very small.,36227,2
36227,I cant use it so I give to my daughter who is a small size and the shirts fit perfectly to  her And pants a little bit  big.,36227,2
36228,Really cute but it fell apart as I put it on.,36228,2
36228,The extention chain fell off and one of the black things disconnected from the end.,36228,2
36229,"Ok...First, I was very excited about ordering, and receiving this.",36229,2
36229,"I got it a few weeks after I ordered it, so the shipping was great.",36229,2
36229,"However, the material was polyester-ish and very, very small.",36229,2
36229,"In American clothes, I rock a medium.",36229,2
36229,I have an athletic build so I try to be careful about ordering several sizes up if the product is an overseas product.,36229,2
36229,"The XL, which I assumed would easily fit *may* have fit me when I was 10.",36229,2
36229,Maybe.,36229,2
36229,"I think this could be a very cute blazer for a petite lady or girl who has a very particular style, but it is not something I personally would wear to the office.",36229,2
36230,I got them and they didn't fix even though they were the right size,36230,2
36231,Way to see through,36231,2
36232,"I always use small size, that blouse is too big on top and the buttons look so cheap.",36232,2
36233,"The ones I received are not the turf version, the bottom is flat instead of with the rubber spikes for turf.",36233,2
36233,It is a nice shoe but not what I needed.. too late for return because i needed these for my boys tournament and he had to wear them....,36233,2
36234,"Its okay not as nice as the first one I bought, so im giving this to my momma so we can be twins.",36234,2
36235,The watch itself is great.,36235,2
36235,It was exactly what I was looking for but the band is horrible.,36235,2
36235,Maybe I received a defective one but the pins that attach the clasp to the band popped out literally out of the box.,36235,2
36235,I glued it back in and the next day another pin popped out.,36235,2
36235,I may keep the watch if I can find an decent band to fit it otherwise its going into the trash.,36235,2
36236,These pants were very odd.,36236,2
36236,No tag to determine front or back or size.,36236,2
36236,"They were way too small, I have ordered many pants like this in the same size and I used the sizing guide.",36236,2
36236,"Last complaint, even though they are supposed to be new, there was a stain on the front.",36236,2
36237,Way too small,36237,2
36238,I'm returning these jeans.,36238,2
36238,1.,36238,2
36238,The material is thin and rough.,36238,2
36238,2.,36238,2
36238,The zipper scares me.,36238,2
36238,It feels like it could break any minute or get stuck in the fabric.,36238,2
36238,3.,36238,2
36238,"I realize these jeans are marketed as ""skinny"", but wow!",36238,2
36238,My calves of my legs are of average size and I can hardly get these jeans over them!,36238,2
36238,"I can't say with 100% certainty these jeans are substandard, I'm merely voicing my opinion, and that is.....The jeans are cheaply made, the fabric is not quality, ans your calves of your legs better be the size of toothpicks.",36238,2
36238,These jeans fit weird.,36238,2
36239,It does fit exactly as it should.,36239,2
36239,But I simply don't like how it looks on.,36239,2
36239,If your larger which I am it just doesn't flow very well.,36239,2
36240,"I wanted to love this shirt but when I received it, the sleeve seam was torn in several spots.",36240,2
36240,"It's such a beautiful print and soft material, just poorly constructed.",36240,2
36240,Too bad....,36240,2
36241,"Too tight in some areas, too big in others.",36241,2
36241,The fit is very strange!,36241,2
36241,"I wanted to like these, but the fit is cut oddly.",36241,2
36242,Runs small.,36242,2
36242,Pretty/vibrant colors.,36242,2
36242,Passing them on to my much smaller daughter.,36242,2
36243,Turned black almost immediately and caused the other bracelets I wore with it to turn as well.,36243,2
36244,Only fits a certain body type and way too small,36244,2
36245,"They fit well, but after the third time being worn, the sole separated from the shoe.",36245,2
36245,My daughter is five and was upset because the other children teased her about her shoe.,36245,2
36246,The large amount of return instructions inside this dress irritated me from the moment I opened the package.,36246,2
36246,I ordered this through Amazon so that is how I'm returning it.,36246,2
36246,The seller wants you to jump through hoops and call their customer service within 7 days or you can't return this.,36246,2
36246,Just an FYI as I think that is important.,36246,2
36246,Read the instructions just in care you order direct from the seller!,36246,2
36246,The dress itself is a thick stretch material.,36246,2
36246,I ordered white and it was not see through at all.,36246,2
36246,I am 5'10 and 122 lbs so the small fit but was really snug.,36246,2
36246,The construction of this dress is way off for a normal female torso.,36246,2
36246,"As others have said, the straps are too tight and short and the bust comes up way too high on the chest but also has no room to fit a large bust.",36246,2
36246,"I am a 34b and it actually was baggy up top if I bent over but also too high on my chest to see cleavage and the straps needed to be two inches longer the material is like tight, thick hard bandage that could abrade your skin if it rubbed under your arms all night.",36246,2
36246,Very weird cut.,36246,2
36246,The back seam and side seams were also not straight.,36246,2
36246,"I kept adjusting thinking I may have the dress twisted but it was the dress, not my body that was not straight.",36246,2
36246,I hope the return goes smoothly!,36246,2
36247,"It is cut box like, will just wear around the house, not as pictured",36247,2
36248,Very tight and nice in legs but hangs horribly in seat and crouch area.,36248,2
36248,Will be returning these,36248,2
36249,big,36249,2
36250,Wings are to triangle shaped,36250,2
36251,Not made  very well.,36251,2
36251,The lace is fragile and the little chain breaks if it's pulled the tiniest bit.,36251,2
36251,I wouldn't recommend buying it but if your extra cautious with it not will probably be fine.,36251,2
36252,"Kinda sad got it today was expecting to wear it today but sadly it's in men sizes so a,large was giant and swallowed me whole :-(",36252,2
36253,Not sure what the elastic and clips are for inside.,36253,2
36253,I clipped them together to make a tighter fit but I know that's not how they're supposed to be.,36253,2
36253,The wig isn't as pictured.,36253,2
36253,The color is a great baby powder blue BUT it's not set and curly like the picture.,36253,2
36253,"You put it on and it all falls down, no matter how many times you turn it.",36253,2
36253,Over all it's a blue mess.,36253,2
36253,Had it on for five minutes it's all knotted up and frizzy.,36253,2
36253,I look more like blue medusa than Marie Antoinette.,36253,2
36253,Maybe some rubber bands hair spray and bobbypins could save it.,36253,2
36253,NOT what I had in mind.,36253,2
36253,Had many set baroque wigs before.,36253,2
36254,Fit fine for a three days.,36254,2
36254,Began to ride up when moving.,36254,2
36254,Also boning fell out only after a few days.,36254,2
36255,Blah,36255,2
36256,Does not fit in the wallett.,36256,2
36257,Come ON!,36257,2
36257,"I am a small woman, I ordered a medium because I wanted them to be nice and loose....but nooooooo, they are super snug!",36257,2
36257,Are they using children's sizes?,36257,2
36257,geese loise.,36257,2
36257,Otherwise they are adorable.,36257,2
36257,"the fabric is cheap, but they are cute.",36257,2
36257,"Not worth the price they are asking, should be more like $4.99, for real",36257,2
36258,Did not like the material it was fashioned from regret the order,36258,2
36259,I bought these for my girls because they had screw on backs.,36259,2
36259,The earrings themselves did not fall out but the stones did.,36259,2
36259,I was disappointed!,36259,2
36260,Not authentic!,36260,2
36260,The lens are glued in place crooked and there's gold spray paint of the edge of the lense.,36260,2
36260,Great knock-offs but I could have paid $5.00 Downtown Los Angeles is I wanted a fake product.,36260,2
36260,Horrible seller trying to pass them off as authentic.,36260,2
36261,"Like a few others, I liked the way this shirt looked and the way the material draped on the model.",36261,2
36261,I'm 5'7 and a size 13/14 with a 40DD bust.,36261,2
36261,They came packaged well in a plastic Ziploc type bag.,36261,2
36261,I purchased the Black and Red in a size XXL.,36261,2
36261,I always order up a size or two when I know items are coming from China as they tend to run a bit small.,36261,2
36261,So I ordered the XXL hoping for the best.,36261,2
36261,"Here's what I liked about the blouse....the colors were bright and vibrant, and the material is light, soft to the touch and cool, making it a great choice for summer.",36261,2
36261,"But, here's the problem I found...as others have stated, the blouse has a seam that runs from the zipper sideways around to the left hip?",36261,2
36261,The zipper on the 2 shirts I received were sewed on at a slight slant?,36261,2
36261,Which made it hang a little weird?,36261,2
36261,I did not see this in the picture?,36261,2
36261,I also thought for a size XXL the shirt was a little snug in the bust.,36261,2
36261,"It did seem full enough in the middle but with the sleeves running way too small in the width and short in the length, it was a FAIL for me!",36261,2
36261,"Looked nothing like the picture, full in some areas and tight in others, leaving it looking way out of proportion.",36261,2
36261,What a shame!,36261,2
36261,This blouse has the potential if they would just get the size proportion right for the larger sizes.,36261,2
36261,I will be returning these.,36261,2
36262,I was hoping for a more fitted look.,36262,2
36262,It's wide and the material isn't really soft... Not worth it,36262,2
36263,This set of goggles is designed to be worn by a piece of cardboard (as pictured) not a human being.,36263,2
36263,It is barely wearable regardless of the size of the head trying to wear it.,36263,2
36263,"It's so front heavy that even if you get it to sit precariously on your nose, it falls off with the slightest movement.",36263,2
36263,"They're cute in theory, but unless you have a completely flat face, they're not worth it.",36263,2
36264,This is nice but fits way too small!,36264,2
36264,"On top of that, it shrinks after one wash, so I wouldn't recommend this.",36264,2
36264,The material is thin and looks cheap too.,36264,2
36265,The frame is very fragil and looks so sheap like it is..a few months wearing them and thats it.,36265,2
36266,"The proportions of this shirt seem a bit odd, at least to me.",36266,2
36266,"The sleeves are longer than I expected and the shoulders are broad, relative to surprisingly narrow midriff section.",36266,2
36266,All of this became mood when the sleeve stitching began unraveling the moment I pulled the shirt out of its plastic bag.,36266,2
36267,Gigantic.,36267,2
36267,I'm not small and I could fit my two small children in the top with me!,36267,2
36267,Gorgeous colour and nice shape but go down two sizes.,36267,2
36268,Did not like the material at all,36268,2
36269,The shoulders on this shirt are huge.,36269,2
36269,It's also incredibly long.,36269,2
36269,"Fits through torso and hips, but shoulders are so big and loose that this sits like an 'off the shoulder' top and exposes my bra straps at all times.",36269,2
36269,"Also, I know the buttons are supposed to be off center, but when wearing the shirt they just look crooked...like an irregular item.",36269,2
36270,"The sweater was beautiful the first time I tried it on, however,  after wearing it 3 times it got really really pilly!",36270,2
36271,"It is too long and I have a large nose, I cannot get it to lie flat.",36271,2
36271,and you can see everything in my nostril.,36271,2
36272,Has potential to be cute but the fit is a whole size smaller than listed.,36272,2
36272,"Also, the material feels weird, and the quality of stitching was terrible.",36272,2
36272,The sleeves were already coming apart out of the package.,36272,2
36272,"Also, the design on the back is not altered enough to look like it's on purpose.",36272,2
36272,"Some lines meet, some don't.",36272,2
36272,Just overall poor quality.,36272,2
36272,"The seller did offer a full refund, however, due to the poor stitching, which I appreciated.",36272,2
36273,"Light weight, cheap fleece.",36273,2
36273,I'll be giving it to a child runs way too small for an adult.,36273,2
36274,"These were very thick, it was hard to get through.",36274,2
36274,When I got them in they looked too large and fit very uncomfortably.,36274,2
36275,"They are pretty, however, the quality is on the poor side.",36275,2
36275,"The post seems very weak and I believe it might break any time soon, while adjusting it to my ears.",36275,2
36276,"Bottom and tail fit great, too was way too big and hard to adjust.",36276,2
36277,just way to small,36277,2
36278,Ordered a large for a loose fit and the label stated that it was a large.,36278,2
36278,"However, it was obviously a small or even an xsmall.",36278,2
36278,"Also note, the return is not as easy and you are responsible for return shipping costs!!",36278,2
36278,!,36278,2
36279,The only reason it didn't get 1 star is because of the price.,36279,2
36279,"The earrings hang weird, I've tried both of them on separate ears but they just look funny.",36279,2
36279,I'll probably take them apart and use them for a craft or something.,36279,2
36280,Love the shirt just sad it's too big for me to wear!,36280,2
36281,"smells like gasoline, dye came off on me when I tried it on.",36281,2
36281,"I ordered a Large, am 5'10 and wear a size 10-12 - it is SUPER tight.... order at least 1-2 sizes up.",36281,2
36281,"Also they wouldn't return the item - since it shipped from china - instead they offered me a partial refund to ""keep"" it or find someone who can use it.",36281,2
36281,"Fortunately, it wasn't an expensive dress...",36281,2
36282,"Material cheap but expected,  hat is extremely bent can bent it back (maybe with a heat gun)  shirt kind of  small  while the pants could fit on some one twice my size the gun hoslter?",36282,2
36282,"Wouldn't even call it that just a vinyl pocket
I would post a picture of how bad the hat it but don't know how to put a picture  up,  sad can't even wear the hat..",36282,2
36283,"I love this ear cuff, though was made poorly.",36283,2
36283,The leaves began to fall off after wearing once.,36283,2
36284,"Leather started to peel off of the ""genuine leather"" belt after a month of wearing",36284,2
36285,"Beautiful, but too small and the closure was nearly impossible to operate.",36285,2
36285,Back it went.,36285,2
36286,I ordered a size XL and received what looks like a size M. Have had the same problem with the nautical tee shirts I have received also.,36286,2
36286,Very disappointed.,36286,2
36286,Baffled by the bright bow on the back.,36286,2
36286,Makes it look childish.,36286,2
36287,"not what it look like, the hanging portion of the earring twisted and could not be fixed.",36287,2
36288,"The length when a monotone is installed becomes too short that when one starts swimming, it starts rolling down around the hips",36288,2
36289,Way too small,36289,2
36290,"It looks nice, but was too big.",36290,2
36290,Also the top was very stiff and wouldn't bend to cover my boobs.,36290,2
36290,The boobs look like two snow cone!,36290,2
36290,!,36290,2
36291,Eh.,36291,2
36291,Sleeves were not as long or loose as pictured.,36291,2
36291,"I tried to wear it, but it just looked off.",36291,2
36291,"Might look better on someone else, but it didn't work for me.",36291,2
36291,"Material was just fine though, would hold up in the wash without falling apart.",36291,2
36292,Didn't fit,36292,2
36293,The material is pretty cheap and the colors are too harsh.,36293,2
36294,Very flimsy.,36294,2
36294,I would only wear as pi's.,36294,2
36294,Not worth the money.,36294,2
36294,Could get elsewhere for less,36294,2
36295,I wish i would've orded a XL,36295,2
36296,Cheaply made,36296,2
36297,I returned it.,36297,2
36297,Bottom fit very full and made me look much larger than I am.,36297,2
36297,"I liked the corset-like top, but isn't sturdy enough to stand up on it's own.",36297,2
36297,Red velvet had bad creases after a few minutes of wear.,36297,2
36298,"Decent tie, heavy and feels like good quality.",36298,2
36298,"But the actual ""nickel"" part is SUPER dull.",36298,2
36298,Not at all like the pictures.,36298,2
36299,Nice bracelet but not functional for what it is supposed to be used for,36299,2
36300,does not fit as size states and gives the wearer camel toes,36300,2
36301,Pants too short and shirt very large.,36301,2
36301,Definitely not a 5t.,36301,2
36302,These shoes stopped working after 1 day.,36302,2
36302,They lit up but lights went out when my daughter walked on them.,36302,2
36303,Small and dingy dirty looking and the picture is blurry and badly printed.,36303,2
36303,The quality of the fabric used is very nice though.,36303,2
36304,Stuff is not like as in the picture.,36304,2
36304,Disappointed.,36304,2
36305,The quality of the material is great but the size run pretty small.,36305,2
36305,"I wear a small and purchased a medium and it still too small, I would recommend to get 2 sizes up than what you actually wear.",36305,2
36306,Came with many of them having broken chains or latches.,36306,2
36307,"It fits small I had to send it back, overall pretty dress",36307,2
36308,returned,36308,2
36309,Medium fit like an XXS.,36309,2
36309,I couldn't get them over my calves..,36309,2
36309,I have workout leggings ranging from XS- L depending on the brand and they all fit me perfectly...,36309,2
36309,I ended up giving them to someone because I hate sending things back,36309,2
36310,Hated it!,36310,2
36311,broke,36311,2
36312,"Nice dress, but the sizing is very off.",36312,2
36312,It was too small!,36312,2
36313,They run small and tight.,36313,2
36313,More like baby leggings not for a three year old.,36313,2
36314,"To small
But good quality",36314,2
36315,It's a nice quality piece but people don't stress enough in their reviews how small it is.,36315,2
36315,It is veeeeeeeeeeeeery small.,36315,2
36315,Thanks.,36315,2
36316,The shoulder strap broke after a couple of uses and one of the decorative letters came out within a week.,36316,2
36316,Purse matches item description.,36316,2
36317,"The 32/34 size fits my waist perfectly, but doesn't fit my rear end.",36317,2
36317,Won't buy another pair because the rear is not comfortable.,36317,2
36318,Not for taller girls.,36318,2
36318,"If you're  5'8 and up, its going to be too small",36318,2
36319,Bra steaps are not supportive,36319,2
36320,"Vionic shoes are usually a good fit, but these were very long.",36320,2
36320,I wear size 11 and they were long both in front and back.,36320,2
36320,"Unfortunately, although they say return postage covered, it was not, but I returned them anyway because they were trippers with the long front.",36320,2
36320,Didn't need to fall over shoes.,36320,2
36321,They do not even come close to fitting.,36321,2
36322,Not a great fit,36322,2
36323,I think it must be a child's XL.,36323,2
36323,I gave it to a friend who wears children's sizes.,36323,2
36324,"Material is not high quality, kind of grainy looking.",36324,2
36325,Broke quickly after using,36325,2
36326,These are not good insoles if you have difficulty with your feet.,36326,2
36326,They will work maybe for 3 months if used in shoes that you walk in an change often.,36326,2
36327,Ordered a 3XL and it fits like a large.,36327,2
36327,Will be a cute shirt on my daughter.,36327,2
36327,Too bad it didn't fit me!,36327,2
36328,"Way too small, I couldn't even get it over my head.",36328,2

36330,I bought an XL and XXL both sizes are EXTREMLY small.,36330,2
36330,The color was nice and we're of nice quality for the price.,36330,2
36330,The sizing though is completely wrong.,36330,2
36331,Broke very easily and the globe was a little too large for an accessory.,36331,2
36332,I absolutely loved the style and material.,36332,2
36332,"However, the bust sizing is all wrong.",36332,2
36332,"I used the suggested measurements, went up a size to be safe.",36332,2
36332,Nope!,36332,2
36332,"Even if I wore a ""minimizer"" bra, no way would the girls fit.",36332,2
36332,Very sad I had to return the dress.,36332,2
36333,I wanted to love this suit but it is too small in the torso which then causes my boobs to hangout.,36333,2
36334,Way too small,36334,2
36335,This can be bought at any discount cloths store for 3 bucks.,36335,2
36335,"Nothing to see here, move along...",36335,2
36336,"Hit and miss, takes many tries and different angle before it works with iPhone screen.",36336,2
36336,"After a couple of uses, I found holes between fingers, the base where fingers meet.",36336,2
36336,"With that, my hands felt cold when I use them out in cold weather.",36336,2
36337,It's exactly what's in the picture but very cheaply made.,36337,2
36337,I won't even wear it because it looks so cheap....,36337,2
36338,I gave it to a friend.,36338,2
36338,It fit her-she loves it!,36338,2
36339,run very small across the bust.,36339,2
36340,Coin purse is the best part.,36340,2
36340,Design is very cute but material and style doesnt meet satisfactory,36340,2
36341,Cheap material,36341,2
36342,"Largest size ""might"" fit a 10 year old, maybe.",36342,2
36342,LOL It's well made for the price but the sizing kills the deal... returned!,36342,2
36343,I purchased a Large and my niece who wears a size 8 fits it perfectly.,36343,2
36343,Definitely not sized correctly,36343,2
36344,too larg,36344,2
36345,They are pretty but way too big.,36345,2
36345,I make jewelry so I ended up taking them apart and using the different parts for different pieces.,36345,2
36346,Okay.,36346,2
36347,I loved this bag when I saw it online and when I took it out of the packaging.,36347,2
36347,"However, as it sat in my bedroom it started to emit this chemical smell that gave me a headache.",36347,2
36347,"I don't know what the leather was treated with, and I cannot stand the smell.",36347,2
36347,"Unfortunately, it is going back.",36347,2
36348,beautiful lace...nice fabric..a bit small though.,36348,2
36349,I got a XXL.,36349,2
36349,I wear XL to XXL.,36349,2
36349,Those always fit me good.,36349,2
36349,Sometimes a little baggy.,36349,2
36349,"But this came, tag reads XXL, and fits me like a medium or large.",36349,2
36349,I'm keeping it cuz I'm losing weight and should fit me better shortly but I'm still disappointed.,36349,2
36350,Cheap quality and design.,36350,2
36350,It does NOT look as good as the picture.,36350,2
36350,It is over priced.,36350,2
36351,Quality material and hardware.,36351,2
36351,Clasps far too week/loose to hold tight to any shirt I have in my closet.,36351,2
36351,Tends to slip off with only minor movements.,36351,2
36352,The material felt plastic & it was way too small.,36352,2
36352,Even according to the size chart.,36352,2
36352,The length was way too short as well.,36352,2
36353,You get what you pay for.,36353,2
36353,The inserts in the bra area are like a padded frisbee.,36353,2
36353,Such a weird shape.,36353,2
36353,The stomach material is very tight.,36353,2
36353,I would not wear this out in public with the way it fits.,36353,2
36354,Not really well made,36354,2
36355,Recommend removing the wires.,36355,2
36355,"If a young girl tries it on that may not be fully developed on top, it does not lay right.",36355,2
36355,It just needs to form to the body and make it look fake.,36355,2
36356,"This was a cute top, however, it was way too small.",36356,2
36356,it doesn't have any stretch to it and i couldn't even get it on.,36356,2
36356,i usually wear a medium and thought i should get a larger size because of the other reviews and i actually got an XL to be safe and it was still too small.,36356,2
36356,i wouldn't recommend getting this top unless you are really tiny.,36356,2
36356,hope this helps.,36356,2
36357,I ordered the one size and it was too big there was too much material in the skirt part so it hung down and there was no type of shape it was like a giant cotton nightgown,36357,2
36358,Generally i wear a large tops.,36358,2
36358,"In designer i wear a XL comfortable
But this was like XL in little girl size.",36358,2
36358,My daughter is a size 2 in womens and it fit but was snug.,36358,2
36358,its a simple long sleeve T with the embroidered sleeve.,36358,2
36358,Not high quality but if it fit i would have wore it with jeans or shorts.,36358,2
36358,Disappointed:(,36358,2
36359,This suit fits TIGHT.,36359,2
36359,Plus the torso is super short.,36359,2
36359,"It's made for extremely short people, I guess.",36359,2
36359,"It doesn't look terrible on and the material is nice, but the fit is awful.",36359,2
36360,"These jeans were fairly comfortable, but were very long.",36360,2
36360,"I'm 5'4"" and couldn't make these fit or look good without having to go to a seamstress to get the length of these pants down.",36360,2
36361,This Bathing suit fit way too small.,36361,2
36361,Got a size Medium.,36361,2

36361,wear size 2 dress and 26 pants.,36361,2
36361,usually wear size small in everything.,36361,2
36361,It's a super cute bathing suit though!,36361,2
36361,does not come with boob padding.,36361,2
36361,I think if I got a XLarge it would have fit me perfectly.,36361,2
36361,Size Up..,36361,2
36361,"Gave to my gf, she's my size, was small on her also.",36361,2
36362,"I wanted to love this but just don't :( if you have big boobs, the top is terrible.",36362,2
36362,The bottoms are ok but I would not recommend this,36362,2
36363,"Fits great but not like the picture its definitely not long, I am 5'4 and very curvy and the dress was ordered im a large but it only came to my calves.",36363,2
36364,Cheap costume glasses.,36364,2
36364,"The lens had a ""wave"" look looking thru them so you can only stand them for short periods.",36364,2
36364,However for cheap costume glasses there are indeed cheap costume glasses,36364,2
36365,Smells very heavy of plastic.,36365,2
36366,Order x large and it was too small,36366,2
36367,"I thought it was a great jacket, fit my son perfect.",36367,2
36367,"But after a few washes, the zipper broke, so I can no longer close it, which defeats the purpose if it is chilly out.",36367,2
36367,I would not recommend.,36367,2
36368,"You get what you pay for, the glasses are cute but the nose pieces were damaged on one side when I got them.",36368,2
36368,"I still wear them, but I wouldn't purchase again.",36368,2
36369,A little baggy in the crotch area but besides that they fit okay,36369,2
36370,"not what i expected, to large and to short",36370,2
36371,Not worth the price you pay.,36371,2
36371,"Honestly, I could have spent the same amount at forever21 and got something better quality.",36371,2
36372,"I returned this shirt and it was a little big for the size i normally wear, it was big at the shoulders and a lot longer than i expected it to be, but otherwise it was good material and cute but just not right for me",36372,2
36373,The pants are okay but how they look is different than the picture.,36373,2
36373,They are shorter and tight at the bottom.,36373,2
36374,It is too large,36374,2
36375,hard to put on material is not flexible at all I returned and order simulate  shoes,36375,2
36376,I thought it would be a bit thicker....,36376,2
36377,Runs very large.,36377,2
36377,"Also has a weird piece by the neck, like a little collar.",36377,2
36377,And the front panels are very long.,36377,2
36377,Color and fabric is nice.,36377,2
36378,"This runs very small, I gave it to my 18 year old daughter, she wears a 5 and it fit her.",36378,2
36379,I think this is really a print that someone has put brush strokes on.,36379,2
36379,not and original.,36379,2
36380,"I wanted to like this sweater ,I'm a 5'5"" size 2 and this sweater was not slouchy.",36380,2
36380,"The sleeves are short and the waistline is fitted and ends right at the waist snugly, in the photo it looks as though its slouchy and much longer this is not what I received :( Disappointed, I wish the sleeves weren't 3/4 length.",36380,2
36380,The sweater stretched and lost its shape when I did wear it :( The back opening does not drop as low as in the photo.,36380,2
36380,"Cute for a fitted ,short sweater but it wasn't what I was expecting when I purchased this sweater.",36380,2
36381,Low quality,36381,2
36382,"I love the look and fit of this top, however, I couldn't stand the material.",36382,2
36382,"It is not ""soft"" like the description says; it's actually quite scratchy in my opinion (90% Polyester 10% Polyurethane (Spandex).",36382,2
36382,I prefer cotton or cotton blend tops.,36382,2
36382,I returned this top for a refund.,36382,2
36383,I didn't like them,36383,2
36384,"When I got this in the mail in was in a little plastic bag so I thought it would come out just fine but when I opened it, the product was super linty and a lot of the sewing was sticking out.",36384,2
36384,The white stitchings were pretty dirty.,36384,2
36384,I was very disappointed.,36384,2
36384,This was supposed to be a gift but I don't think I'd want to give something like this.,36384,2
36385,It's a weird material.,36385,2
36385,Not a flattering fit.,36385,2
36385,Lose in so places tight in others.,36385,2
36385,Would not recommend.,36385,2
36386,Very cute top and quality is good.,36386,2
36386,However the width of the top is extremely too narrow.,36386,2
36386,Cup size was good fit but the top didn't fit across my chest size of a 32!,36386,2
36387,I ordered an extra due to the fact that it comes from China though I'm a small.,36387,2
36387,It fits good but the fabric is horrible I couldn't wear it.,36387,2
36387,I've Never Worn it.,36387,2
36387,Still thinking of what I'll do with it.,36387,2
36387,But I expected that since it's really cheap.,36387,2
36388,The armholes are WAY too small.,36388,2
36388,"I bought a size 4, and when the straps were too short/the arm holes too small, I bought a size 6.",36388,2
36388,But the bigger size has the same problem!,36388,2
36388,Every time I raise my arms (even if it's just a little bit!,36388,2
36388,"), the dress cuts into my armpits and restricts my arms' range of motion.",36388,2
36388,The rest of the dress is great......I just wish it had adjustable straps or bigger armholes.,36388,2
36389,"Nice fabric and cut but as others mentioned the chest is very odd looking as the ""belt"" gathering cuts the breasts in half and looks odd.",36389,2
36390,The actual cut isn't great.,36390,2
36390,My hubby had no idea what it was supposed to be.,36390,2
36390,"They're small, so best for a teen or pinkie.",36390,2
36391,These beads are freakin plastic and Teeny tiny.,36391,2
36391,A year ago I ordered a very similar product and got a MUCH BETTER mala.,36391,2
36391,The only reason I'm not returning is that the knot and charm are nice looking so I wear it as a bracelet.,36391,2
36391,I will not meditate with plastic!,36391,2
36391,In the first photo you can see the diff between the beads I ordered a year ago and the ones I just got.,36391,2
36391,"In the second photo u can see it does work well as a ""throwaway"" bracelet.",36391,2
36391,One I can wear to work and not have to worry about gettin damaged but I didn't think I'd pay what i did for THAT!,36391,2
36392,Could be the fact that i brought them for a wild 6 yr old.,36392,2
36392,I paid too much for a pair of glasses that the lens fall out with ease.,36392,2
36392,"However, I love the frame is sort of elastic to where they will not break easy",36392,2
36393,I purchased the Fashion Drop Earrings with Soft Cream Simulated Pearl Fireball and the red is utter crap.,36393,2
36393,I opened the box to find pastel pink earrings!,36393,2
36393,"The upper red crystal is in fact red but the pearl isnt, it's a very noticeable pink color.",36393,2
36393,I would've returned these earrings if it wasn't so much of a hassle.,36393,2
36393,"However I am going to keep them, I was able to correct the coloring using a red permanent marker and now they are a nice vibrant red and I like them.",36393,2
36393,But I shouldn't have to use a Sharpie to color them correctly.,36393,2
36393,"You've been warned, only order the red if you are okay with pink pearls or if you have a red Sharpie on hand.",36393,2
36393,"I'm including pictures, the one on the left is the original earrings.",36393,2
36393,"Although it's difficult to tell in the picture, they are very pink.",36393,2
36393,The picture on the right is after I took the red Sharpie to them and colored them red.,36393,2
36393,You can tell there's a difference.,36393,2
36393,"This is my rating system:
1 star: I hated it
2 stars: I didn't like it
3 stars: I'm neutral about it
4 stars: I liked it
5 stars: I loved it",36393,2
36394,Had a hole in them,36394,2
36395,"If I'd realized this dress was coming from China, I would not have ordered it.",36395,2
36395,"It was way too big, couldn't return but did get a half price credit from the seller.",36395,2
36395,"I don't like the material, it has a very synthetic feels to it, does not feel very good against your skin.",36395,2
36395,I gave it away.,36395,2
36396,I loved the pictures but unfortunately it's not as nice in person.,36396,2
36396,The pattern does not stand out as much even in daylight and the material is fabric and arrived wrinkled.,36396,2
36396,I would maybe pay 1/2 the price but not $60.,36396,2
36396,Spent a few days deciding on a new winter purse but back it goes.,36396,2
36397,returned,36397,2
36398,Looks cheap ... but the dangle effect is nice.,36398,2
36399,Was not the same as pictured!,36399,2
36399,Shorter sleeves and different material.,36399,2
36400,"this shirt is NOT that long, its very short",36400,2
36401,Wife thought the material was cheap.,36401,2
36402,Material is completely sheer.,36402,2
36402,Sizing is petite and runs very small.,36402,2
36403,"I don't like how fit, i look like a plastic bag, the material is very good",36403,2
36404,Much smaller than stated size not very good quality,36404,2
36405,Love the stones but in about a week I had to restring as the elastic used was very cheap.,36405,2
36406,Did not look at all like a moonstone.,36406,2
36406,Did not look like a delicate necklace.,36406,2
36406,Color was blue and white.,36406,2
36407,Looked like something for a child.,36407,2
36408,"cute, but fell apart",36408,2
36409,Feels like a moomoo.,36409,2
36409,Not very flattering,36409,2
36410,Very low quality,36410,2
36411,Did not fit as advertised.,36411,2
36411,I measured my glasses as suggested and ordered.,36411,2
36411,They work great if you want tl wear them without your prescription glasses,36411,2
36412,Awkward fit.,36412,2
36412,Looks nothing like the photo.,36412,2
36413,"Looks NOTHING like picture
All seems are off.",36413,2
36413,Crooked.,36413,2
36413,Read a lot of reviews on this before purchase.,36413,2
36413,And was still extremely disappointed when I didn't have high expectations to begin with.,36413,2
36413,"One review stated ""a little hard to zip over seam"".",36413,2
36413,Largest understatement.,36413,2
36414,Fits funny.,36414,2
36414,Belt is not proportionate to dress.,36414,2
36414,Way to big.,36414,2
36415,"They look cool, but the hinges on these just plain suck.",36415,2
36415,I bought a pair of cheap glasses off amazon for half of the price of the Woodies.,36415,2
36415,"While neither pair are as good as my Ray-bans, the cheaper ones actually have hinges that hold them well on my face.",36415,2
36415,I always feel like the Woodies are about to fall off.,36415,2
36416,The buttons on this coat are crooked.,36416,2
36416,I don't understand how it passed quality control.,36416,2
36416,"Too bad because the coat fits well, and is nice looking, but I can't wear it with the buttons being so off.",36416,2
36416,See the attached picture.,36416,2
36417,NOT STERLING SILVER.,36417,2
36417,These rings turned my toes green.,36417,2
36417,They became discolored around the edges.. like a copper color.,36417,2
36417,Originally I really liked them and even gave a few away to friends.,36417,2
36417,I like the design.,36417,2
36417,But really disappointed in the fact that they are NOT truly sterling as they are advertised to be.. AND they HAVE a 925 stamp on the inside.,36417,2
36418,Perfect size,36418,2
36419,Way 2 small and took 4ever to arrive.,36419,2
36419,It looked used,36419,2
36420,Two sizes too small,36420,2
36421,The foot strap broke with thread coming unraveled.,36421,2
36422,Ordered the 3X for my wife who is between size 16-18.,36422,2
36422,This barely fit and it was a tight fit at that.,36422,2
36422,I'd say the 3X is more like a 12-14 that will stretch a size bigger.,36422,2
36422,"Otherwise, it does look hot on her... but I don't see her wearing it more than once or twice.",36422,2
36423,Dislike because the clip-on wires won't let the glasses rest on the right place.,36423,2
36424,"Fits good, but the logo is so pixelated.",36424,2
36424,It looks like they found a 5 in by 5 in logo and blew it up to make it bigger for the shirt.,36424,2
36424,Very disapointed.,36424,2
36425,Weird fit and icky material.,36425,2
36425,Wish I had taken the time to return it.,36425,2
36426,I am a 40C and wear a 16-18 in jeans typically.,36426,2
36426,"When they say that this is a ""mini dress"" they mean MINI.",36426,2
36426,"I'm 5""5' and it hit mid-thigh, mostly because of the cut.",36426,2
36426,"I bought a 2X in this and it squished my chest down where a 3x would have sufficed, and my butt is so big that it lifted the back about an inch.",36426,2
36426,I couldn't squat or sit comfortably in this garment.,36426,2
36426,It's just not for curvy ladies.,36426,2
36426,"It's a shame because the neckline and bodice fit well, but once it hits the natural waist there is no give or flare where it should be- it bunches up in places it shouldn't and looks super trashy.",36426,2
36426,That's not including how the seaming down the chest was puckered before I tried it on.,36426,2
36426,I am sending it back because it is not a(n appropriate) dress for me.,36426,2
36426,If I wasn't so curvy it would look a ton better.,36426,2
36427,I like the shirts but the fabric it is not good it like the umbrella fabric,36427,2
36428,Cute skirt but I am 5''4 and like my skirts a little longer.,36428,2
36429,Very tight neck; somewhat small all over.,36429,2
36430,Totally meant for bubble butts not so much for my saggy butt,36430,2
36431,They're just ok.,36431,2
36431,Fit fine but too shiny to look like jeggings.,36431,2
36431,Should have returned.,36431,2
36432,"Material was cheap, sizing was way off, skirt was tight material that couldn't stretch whatsoever, and the top was so small but so stretched out.",36432,2
36432,"Could not form to body, just felt like tissue paper falling on top of your chest.",36432,2
36433,"I ordered this shirt in a 3X size, which would have normally been a little too large--but I did it to compensate for possible shrink depending on the fabric.",36433,2
36433,This manufacturers idea of a 3X is the same as a medium in any regular terms.,36433,2
36433,I was really quite displeased.,36433,2
36434,Low finishing !,36434,2
36435,Cheap fabric and looks weird on torso area,36435,2
36436,The Cross Keeps slipping through the infinity loop.,36436,2
36436,Won't stay fasatened,36436,2
36437,"The quality is so so, but sadly, the sleeves are quarter length on me (5'7"").",36437,2
36437,"If you are 5' or shorter, this may work for you.",36437,2
36437,The width is plenty wide according to sizing.,36437,2
36438,"The fabric is not bad, but it is just a weird shape.",36438,2
36438,"Too baggy, the length is off, the belt does not help and is a off-putting material.",36438,2
36438,"It is cheap enough that you could probably take the risk and hope it works out, but I will just be donating it unfortunately.",36438,2
36439,small,36439,2
36440,"I ordered this backpack and when I got it, the tan diamond on front has the word 'winner' embossed in it.",36440,2
36440,Also a tag on the side with winner.,36440,2
36440,Inside the backpack is embossed stamp of winner and Japanese print.,36440,2
36440,"Other than that it states on the cleaning tag, do not wash with detergent or shampoo or bleach, don't leave in the sun or get wet...so weird.",36440,2
36440,I will be returning.,36440,2
36440,Snaps also come undone really easy and the front pouch is zippered but not big enough for iPad,36440,2
36441,This is cute but it is not a thick sweatshirt.,36441,2
36441,It is a thin knit and feels more like a heavy T-shirt.,36441,2
36441,"It is cute, but it won't keep a kid warm.",36441,2
36441,"Also, my little boy is very average-sized; I ordered his true size and it barely fits him.",36441,2
36441,He will be out of it in no time.,36441,2
36441,"I wish I'd sent it back for a bigger one, or just sent it back.",36441,2
36442,"This blouse was so small, it probably would fit someone who was size 4.",36442,2
36442,Very disappointed.,36442,2
36443,Material is unpleasant.,36443,2
36444,Nice shoe but only one of them actually worked.,36444,2
36444,I am so disappointed in this company for not checking the shoe before sending it to me.,36444,2
36444,It was Xmas gift to my daughter and now I have to send it back and purchase a whole different style,36444,2
36445,I'm so sad about these shorts.,36445,2
36445,"I'm a pear shape, with bigger thighs and behind.",36445,2
36445,These shorts are made for apple shape with skinny legs and bigger belly.,36445,2
36445,"I regularly wear a size 16 but got the 18, just in case.",36445,2
36445,"they were soooo tight in the thighs and butt, and gave me about 4 inches extra in my waist.",36445,2
36445,Will have to return.,36445,2
36446,Quality is an issue.,36446,2
36447,The item did not fit at all.,36447,2
36447,It appeared it had shipped from overseas.,36447,2
36447,I'll pass closer attention to where the items ship from.,36447,2
36448,This thing kinda sucks.,36448,2
36448,The mesh inside is uncomfortable and it's too big.,36448,2
36448,Order a size down.,36448,2
36449,Really baggy,36449,2
36450,Not great for women with large breasts.,36450,2
36450,Little to no support.,36450,2
36451,"does not stand up by itself, clasp is weak, buttons are not to use",36451,2
36452,Not worth the money.,36452,2
36452,Mercedes logo is extremely faded and hard to see on tshirt.,36452,2
36453,"Ok, the swimsuit is very nice, lovely design.",36453,2
36453,Here is the problem.,36453,2
36453,"I usally wear a size medium in swimsuits, I am 5'6 139 pounds.",36453,2
36453,I ordered a size large since I ordered suits from amazona before and they were always too small if I ordered a medium.,36453,2
36453,"The bottom half was too big but it could work, I wear a 36b bra so if figured a size large would fit perfect or a little loose which would be fine.",36453,2
36453,The top of this swim suit was way too small for me.,36453,2
36453,I gave it to my daughter who wears a 34b and size small and extra small in all of her clothes and it fit her perfectly.,36453,2
36453,I was reallly disapointed because I really love the suit but the size is all over the place.,36453,2
36453,I would need a size medium in the bottom and a extra large in the top which is a lot crazy.,36453,2
36454,Too small,36454,2
36455,Cute dress but way too sheer!,36455,2
36456,Size too small.,36456,2
36457,It fits like a maternity top - it fit in the chest and way too much material in the mid section.,36457,2
36457,I had to send it back,36457,2
36458,"Very pretty, but very small.",36458,2
36458,You'd have to have the tiniest nipples to fit in these.,36458,2
36458,Bummer.,36458,2
36459,One of the shoes never worked really disappointed ..!!,36459,2
36459,!,36459,2
36460,Button on belt is susceptible to catching on almost anything while attached to clip.,36460,2
36460,Did not make it past the first trip before the button was pulled away from belt.,36460,2
36460,"Love the idea, but not quite as strong as it claims.",36460,2
36461,"If you are a collector of hat:

 I cannot say I have a big or small head, however, all other hats I've bought fit just right.",36461,2
36461,* This is the only only one that fits a tad smaller.,36461,2
36461,* When I see myself in mirror I look like I forced the hat on with pressure; loosening on the back it does not do the trick.,36461,2
36461,* The locking mechanism is faulty.,36461,2
36461,"One loses grip when one takes off cap (when scratching head or readjusting position; backwards/forward)
* I like to wear mine backwards depending on the outfit.",36461,2
36461,It looks worse when I do wear it so.,36461,2
36461,I do like the design style and material.,36461,2
36461,"For the above reasons I would not recommend to those who already are aware of having a 'regular' sized head or large one, of course.",36461,2
36461,I believe smaller sized heads will enjoy a killer look.,36461,2
36461,Perhaps teenagers 15-yrs-old and down,36461,2
36462,The shirt I received looks nothing like the model.,36462,2
36462,"Its more of a spandex material, and runs a little small and short.",36462,2
36462,The photo is very deceiving.,36462,2
36463,Not what I expected...too short.,36463,2
36464,I ordered a 2XL because I read that you would need a size bigger.,36464,2
36464,Make that two sizes bigger.,36464,2
36464,Fits tight which is a shame since it's a nice looking sweater.,36464,2
36465,"I got a size up it was too small the bathing suit was broken upon arrival, throwed it away",36465,2
36466,"It's a good price, but kids fragile mine broke on the first day , really disappointed",36466,2
36467,Not fitted and isn't good for cleavage.,36467,2
36467,Doesn't fit like picture,36467,2
36468,"Poor quality, very tight.",36468,2
36468,Returning.,36468,2
36469,"Disappointed in the quality of sewing, the inner skirt ran easily and 3/4 layers of the tulle were seen together.",36469,2
36469,I only needed for a day otherwise I would have returned it.,36469,2
36470,The only thing that I liked it is the color.,36470,2
36470,-the size was very small although I selected large and I wear small.,36470,2
36470,"-after one laundry, the fabric has ruined and started to shrink.",36470,2
36471,They are really big when they come they are super big on your hands,36471,2
36472,"Cheap price, but Cheap quality",36472,2
36473,I reas the review that says that it fit true to size.,36473,2
36473,"I tried it on and it does not fit to size, it runs small.",36473,2
36473,I would advise  you to order a size bigger.,36473,2
36474,"Cheaply made, itchy.",36474,2
36475,This is NOT true to size.,36475,2
36475,I'm a bigger girl and usually wear an Xl-XXL.,36475,2
36475,Reading other reviews made me think I should order up in size just incase.,36475,2
36475,I ordered a 3XL.,36475,2
36475,It fit more like a medium and the back part looks like a cape.,36475,2
36475,It's not worth it.,36475,2
36476,"I love how it feels but it looks way longer in the picture, the top doesn't fit right and there is no way the one I got is a XXL.",36476,2
36476,It fits like a large.,36476,2
36476,Not happy at all.,36476,2
36477,Material is not the greatest.,36477,2
36477,Doesn't flow very well.,36477,2
36478,The leather gets wrinkly and looks horrible after only a few days...,36478,2
36479,Dislike because it get rusty ans broke off easily,36479,2
36480,"The fabric is thicker than I had imagined from the picture, which I didn't like.",36480,2
36480,I like the color.,36480,2
36480,It fits smaller than I expected but it's ok. Also the fabric is shinier than I expected.,36480,2
36480,I don't hate it but it's not what I had in mind from the pic.,36480,2
36481,"I got the blue pair of replacement lenses and although they are pretty good, I think the polarized part might be screwed up on mine.",36481,2
36481,Disclaimer I haven't owned a pair of polarized ones in like 10 years but on the pair I received the bottom half creates like a red hue and the top half is what you would expect form a normal pair of none polarized sunglasses.,36481,2
36481,The main problem is my pupils sit right at the boundary between the two so I can't really use these without being extremely annoyed.,36481,2
36481,But as far as build quality and fit they seem rock solid.,36481,2
36482,Pajamas reek of perfume or a perfumed laundry product.,36482,2
36482,Scent remains after they were washed 3 times in fragrance-free detergent.,36482,2
36482,Getting near them makes me sneeze and touching them causes skin irritation and itching.,36482,2
36482,Why sell pajamas that are highly allergenic?,36482,2
36482,"It amazes me that clothing impregnated with fragrance isn't sold with a warning, given that many people are sensitive to fragrance.",36482,2
36482,"I had to return these, which is a shame because I need pajamas and otherwise would have been happy with them!",36482,2
36483,This skirt doesn't flare out like the picture and is definitely more of a yellow gold than the soft greenish pictured here.,36483,2
36483,But it's only $4 so I can't complain too much.,36483,2
36483,I wouldn't wear it though.,36483,2
36484,Very small.,36484,2
36485,Way too short,36485,2
36486,I ordered XL because I hate tight anything!,36486,2
36486,"I happen to be 5'5"" and weigh 150 lbs.",36486,2
36486,Not a large person.,36486,2
36486,"However, I still found these bras, while well made with excellent materials, to be very tight and difficult to close the zipper!",36486,2
36486,"I hate returning things; so I'm going to cut holes in the underband
with a scissors to expand the stretch.",36486,2
36486,I bought these for a comfortable fit only -- but maybe their purpose is for running a marathon?,36486,2
36486,!,36486,2
36487,These pajamas were awesome...until I washed them.,36487,2
36487,They shrunk.,36487,2
36488,This keeps breaking.,36488,2
36489,"The 'Horseshoe' part that is supposed to slip around the nipple, simply doesn't stay on.",36489,2
36489,"I bought these for my wife, and I've tried sucking the nipples, & I've tried icecubes to get them erect, and while I think they look wonderful on her, they always slip off after a few minutes.",36489,2
36489,"I suppose if there was a barbell piercing to hold them on they would work, but without somekind of piercing they will always fall off.",36489,2
36490,Shoe size is almost most 2 sizes to small.,36490,2
36490,Make sure you order 2 sizes bigger than the size you need.,36490,2
36490,I had to return these and buy a bigger size.,36490,2
36491,I ordered a large expecting to be a bit snug but comfortable.,36491,2
36491,I was so wrong!,36491,2
36491,The large fit like a size small or small/medium.,36491,2
36491,I loved the style but I was very disappointed with the fit.,36491,2
36491,I am a 36C and it was crushing the girls!,36491,2
36492,It fits very tight and I am small busted.,36492,2
36492,I suggest ordering a size up.,36492,2
36493,Runs small.,36493,2
36493,Very thin material.,36493,2
36493,"Cheap product, I would not order again.",36493,2
36494,Too small,36494,2
36495,Very Small.,36495,2
36495,the length includes the adjustable chain which it does not tell you in the description.,36495,2
36496,I'm really disappointed with this purchase.,36496,2
36496,"I should have trusted the reviews, the shirt runs small and is see through in good light.",36496,2
36496,"I'm only keeping the shirt because it will be good to layer up with, but it isn't what I hoped it would be.",36496,2
36497,Very tiny.,36497,2
36497,Maybe made for a child's rist?,36497,2
36498,"They fit great but was a little disappointed because I only received 5 rings instead of 6 and 3 we're black, 1 was silver and 1 was colored which was pretty much all green.",36498,2
36499,Product looks more like a night gown for a senior citizen.,36499,2
36500,"Cheaply made, we'll see if it lasts.",36500,2
36500,Not very promising out of the package.,36500,2
36501,First of all I had to wait a whole month to get this and when I finally received it I was disappointed the ribbon in the waist was stringing out and the out for runs big.....,36501,2
36502,too small and see through,36502,2
36503,Love the fabric.,36503,2
36503,It's is true to this photo.,36503,2
36503,"However, I didn't realize because you can't see it in the picture that the side sleeves have large holes in them and this also has an attached shirt underneath.",36503,2
36503,It is shear so you need something under it.,36503,2
36503,So I modified it by carefully removing the undershirt and sewing up the sleeve holes.,36503,2
36503,I wear it with a navy blue tank top underneath.,36503,2
36503,Got lots of compliments the first time I wore it to work.,36503,2
36504,"I like it, just would rather it fit a bit snugger.",36504,2
36505,Poor quality,36505,2
36506,Item was several sizes too small.,36506,2
36506,"I wear a size small usually, but when I ordered a size small it was too small to even get on.",36506,2
36506,Other than size product looked like the photo and price was excellent.,36506,2
36507,I found it bulkier than most wallets.,36507,2
36507,It also doesn't allow a place for pictures except for a driver's license.,36507,2
36508,"Super cute dress but the material seems not as long in the back, and it barely covers the butt.",36508,2
36509,This runs extremely small.,36509,2
36509,The large fits my daughter who wears Juniors XS.,36509,2
36510,"I had the same experience as another reviewer, hat is way too tall.",36510,2
36510,"diameter is fine and adjustable but I can't do anything about how tall it is, which sucks because the design is really cool.",36510,2
36510,I'm just going to give it to a friend.,36510,2
36511,They did not fit at all.,36511,2
36511,The legs were way too short.,36511,2
36511,I returned them.,36511,2
36511,I am 5'10 and 240 lbs so I ordered XXL and the proportions were for a much shorter person.,36511,2
36512,Very thin metal and fabric.,36512,2
36512,The way it snaps shut doesn't feel solid.,36512,2
36512,The fabric is so thin it kind of flops unless you cut it so it is barely long enough.,36512,2
36512,I would spend a couple extra bucks and get a better one.,36512,2
36513,"Very thin, and runs small, does not wash well.",36513,2
36514,"They will serve the purpose of keeping things ""bundled"" together ie underwear, socks etc so the suitcase is more organized but they are very cheaply made and not high quality.",36514,2
36514,I ordered two sets...one for me and one for a gift.,36514,2
36514,I am considering returning the second set as I will be embarassed to give them as a gift.,36514,2
36514,"I also do not ""appreciate"" the silly stuff printed on the bags: Secret Pouch etc.",36514,2
36514,Not too impressed.,36514,2
36515,It only has 3 pockets for panties.,36515,2
36515,"If you have large breasts and are a size above E, you'll have to fold your bra to fit it in.",36515,2
36515,I needed a box to store my bras flat because they are very expensive and I didn't want to fold them.,36515,2
36515,But this box defeats the purpose.,36515,2
36515,I might use it to store other intimates.,36515,2
36516,Big top and small bottom,36516,2
36517,Nice belt.,36517,2
36517,Over paid 10 bucks.,36517,2
36517,You can get it cheaper,36517,2
36518,"According to the size chart I should have ordered an XL, I ordered a XXL and it was still too small.",36518,2
36518,I was very disappointed.,36518,2
36519,The main color is nowhere near the pink it looks in the picture.,36519,2
36519,It is more grey than anything else.,36519,2
36519,The picture I attached is taken with the material folded and on top of a white counter.,36519,2
36519,The large is also very large.,36519,2
36519,"I'm 5'4 and a size 12-14, and it is way too big to wear with shorts and a top, but may work for a bathing suit cover-up.",36519,2
36519,"I'm debating in returning it, and I never go through the trouble of returning anything.",36519,2
36520,Fits good!,36520,2
36520,Fabric is like a satin fabric almost!,36520,2
36520,Will be worn as a pajama top...nothing else.,36520,2
36521,Poor quality and ugly - but merchant refunded.,36521,2
36522,My child is wearing a size 7 toddler shoe so I  ordered the swim shoes in a size 7 they are very cute but they are too big we can't even wear them they slide around on her foot so much they fall off.,36522,2
36523,Plastic too not flexible enough.,36523,2
36523,Lee Radner,36523,2
36524,Did its job pretty well for about 4 months and then the screen started fogging up.,36524,2
36524,Which meant it was completely waterproof as the back of the watch says.,36524,2
36524,This eventually killed off most of the features but the hands on the dial kept trucking on till the bitter end.,36524,2
36525,couldn't tell what the front side vs the backside was on the bottoms,36525,2
36526,Runs small- I didn't like it.,36526,2
36527,"Doesn't this look like black, rose and cream in the photo?",36527,2
36527,"Nope, it's pink, navy and white.",36527,2
36527,Looks like old lady attire.,36527,2
36527,I wear 20W sometimes a 22W and this 3X is too small and too clingy to my form.,36527,2
36527,"It's like a clingy, slinky nightgown type of material.",36527,2
36527,I am returning to Amazon for the first time ever,36527,2
36528,It's a Ok shirt.,36528,2
36528,Fits two sizes too small.,36528,2
36528,I wear a small shirt size normally.,36528,2
36528,I bought a medium.,36528,2
36528,Should have got a large.,36528,2
36528,Shirt was $3.,36528,2
36528,Shipping was $12 (from china).,36528,2
36528,Wasn't about to pay to ship it back.,36528,2
36529,The black started wearing off the belt almost immediately.,36529,2
36530,"Way small I usually wear a medium or large, I ordered the large and it doesn't even come close to fitting.",36530,2
36530,It is super cute though!,36530,2
36531,The hat was a size to small .,36531,2
36531,Should have went with the xl size.,36531,2
36532,The lights will not stay attached to the sweater.,36532,2
36532,Defeats purpose of having light at all.,36532,2
36532,Too much money for product I wore one time.,36532,2
36533,This wallet is too small in measurement to be used as a checkbook holding wallet.,36533,2
36533,"The card slots are all open, meaning that if you put a card in the top slot, it will fall into oblivion somewhere.",36533,2
36533,"All of the spaces are too tiny for the average hand, unless you are a small child.",36533,2
36533,"Forget using the coin section, the wallet is pretty much useless.",36533,2
36533,"Pretty, but useless.",36533,2
36534,"By the photo, I though I'd be receiving a piece with lots of distress and tears made of a gauzy, sheer fabric.",36534,2
36534,This is a plain white tee shirt that someone put five horizontal slices into with a razor blade.,36534,2
36534,That's all.,36534,2
36534,The tears don't even hang open-- you can see clearly where the razor made mistakes and then tried to straighten the lines back out again.,36534,2
36534,Distressed tees are my fave when they're done right.,36534,2
36534,But this literally looks like I tried to put a white t-shirt through the wash with a pair of scissors by accident.,36534,2
36534,Not at all worth the price and too costly to return.,36534,2
36535,Had to return.,36535,2
36535,Did not fit and wasn't crazy about the material.,36535,2
36536,"I should have listened to the reviews because there were all ON POINT , when it covers your chest it's an extreme camel toe, and if you fix the camel toe your chest is exposed,  damn the inseam because it's a Beautiful piece of clothing.",36536,2
36537,This one-size garment runs small.,36537,2
36537,"As well, it doesn't actually have pockets, merely pocket flaps.",36537,2
36537,"If you're looking for an item with pockets, a garment that fits comfortably loose - this isn't it!",36537,2
36538,Only wore twice.,36538,2
36538,Sags in the pool and not flattering once wet.,36538,2
36539,Measurements were totally off from the scale provided with the product.,36539,2
36539,Very poor customer service.,36539,2
36539,"If to be returned, the manufacturer will not bear cost.",36539,2
36539,Somewhat non refundable.,36539,2
36540,I got tired of buying these and they always turn out too small.,36540,2
36540,"I am 5'4"" 165 and heavy on top, but not so much on the bottom.",36540,2
36540,I remedy this problem by re-sewing them to fit like a regular pantie.,36540,2
36540,Save your money unless you want to do what I did or if you are just petite.,36540,2
36541,"These stated that they were 14"" length, and I'm not buying it.",36541,2
36541,They seem to bunch up around the top of my thighs within the first few steps.,36541,2
36541,I bought these because I work as a delivery driver and I'm in and out of my truck many times a day.,36541,2
36541,They're not as good as I expected.,36541,2
36542,I ordered this as a maternity shirt.,36542,2
36542,I ordered a size up thinking I needed it to cover my belly.,36542,2
36542,It was very large on me.,36542,2
36542,I usually am  I size 14 and it had tons of room.,36542,2
36542,"(XL)  Definitely a shirt, not a dress,  Had no issues returning it and was refunded ASAP.",36542,2
36542,I will order from company again,36542,2
36543,didn't close at all.,36543,2
36543,but they are cute.,36543,2
36543,Such a shame,36543,2
36544,Cheaply made,36544,2
36545,"First off, if you're a larger lady, this suit is NOT for you.",36545,2
36545,There is no support.,36545,2
36545,There is minimal padding in the chest and when I tried it on the padding didn't sit right or cover the right places fully.,36545,2
36545,It would need an underwire of some sort to work.,36545,2
36545,It looked ok when I took it out of the package but upon putting it on I noticed how thin the fabric was - it didn't feel right.,36545,2
36545,The stitching at the chest had a string loose and don't expect it to not fit oddly.,36545,2
36545,VERY cheep feel to the fabric and quality of the construction of this.,36545,2
36546,NOTHING LIKE PICK,36546,2
36547,Runs way to small,36547,2
36548,"Disappointed in the thickness of the fabric, as it seemed very thin.",36548,2
36548,"The fit was good, but I needed a warmer jacket so I returned this.",36548,2
36549,It looked much nicer in the picture.,36549,2
36549,I was disappointed.,36549,2
36550,Very strange material- kinda like a scrub top?,36550,2
36550,Fits tightly and I am super tiny!,36550,2
36550,Tried to return and was offered a small refund and told to keep the shirt.,36550,2
36550,Skip this!,36550,2
36551,You can see the lines from the boost,36551,2
36552,Cute and comfortable but makes me itch after a few hours / nickel allergy,36552,2
36553,Product details say terry cloth leading you to believe it's for after bathing.,36553,2
36553,"However, actual material is polyester which does NOT dry skin.",36553,2
36553,So now my bath robe is a house rob.,36553,2
36554,The dress runs small and is made of very cheap material.,36554,2
36554,Poor quality,36554,2
36555,Ordered 2 only got one and it was too small,36555,2
36556,"I'm not a large person by any means, 5'3 to be exact, and this is rather small on me.",36556,2
36556,It's a bit scratchy but still seems to be will put together.,36556,2
36556,It shows that is long but it in fact is not.,36556,2
36557,"Material is comfortable, nice design.",36557,2
36557,Size runs small and it's clingy and form-fitting for a night gown!!,36557,2
36557,If you're not embarrassed by the material showing your shape (belly and all) then it's an okay gown.,36557,2
36557,"For a plus size like me, this just doesn't work.",36557,2
36557,"Personally, I'll wear it only until I can find a replacement.",36557,2
36558,"Upon wearing it for the first time, I noticed 2 holes in the fabric.",36558,2
36558,"It appeared to be a cut done by packaging, as both tears/holes appeared to be in the same location of where folds met.",36558,2
36558,The bust is also tight.,36558,2
36559,The bra was to little.,36559,2
36559,I am a small lady.,36559,2
36559,But my breasts are very large.,36559,2
36559,But the rest fit fine.,36559,2
36560,"Received different necklace, but it was cute so I kept it.",36560,2
36561,These 34 fit like 36- and the c cup fits like a b,36561,2
36562,Didn't worked for my boyfriend.,36562,2
36563,Nice glasses but very dark.,36563,2
36563,You can only wear them in very sunny days.,36563,2
36563,They fit and feel great.,36563,2
36564,It already had a hole in hit......not pleased!,36564,2
36564,"I live in Central America, no way I'll return it.",36564,2
36565,The analogue portion (i.e.,36565,2
36565,the hands) stopped working after 4 months.,36565,2
36565,"Not worth the price even at $20 unless you only want a digital watch, but in that case you have the hands in the way, too often.",36565,2
36566,This dress was NOT a 2X it would be a smaller size like MEDIUM.,36566,2
36566,I was very disappointed with sizing.,36566,2
36566,i love the print and material but WAYTO SMALL,36566,2
36567,"Fit's as expected, but doesn't wear well.",36567,2
36567,It looks awkward and raggedy.,36567,2
36567,My sister ordered another wallaroo product that wears better.,36567,2
36567,It looks great in the picture.,36567,2
36567,Not so much after you use it (once!,36567,2
36567,).,36567,2
36568,rusted so bad,36568,2
36569,returned poor quality and workmanship!,36569,2
36570,"Order a bigger size, runs small",36570,2
36571,The gloves are definitely warm but not what I expected.,36571,2
36571,I thought that they opened up where the Velcro meets the glove so I could see my son slide his hand in.,36571,2
36571,It's a fully closed glove and the Velcro portion doesn't help tighten the glove around the hand.,36571,2
36571,As my son is playing in the snow the gloves as constantly sliding off regardless of how tight I attempt to wrap the glove.,36571,2
36571,Disappointing.,36571,2
36572,"I returned this dress, it's completely see through and very cheaply made.",36572,2
36573,It wore great at first with a nice fit.,36573,2
36573,Two weeks later the metal buckle came apart from the band and I was so thankful I did not loose my watch.,36573,2
36573,I found the missing piece on the floor the next day.,36573,2
36573,I cannot but it back together and I was disappointed that it did not stand up to everyday wear.,36573,2
36574,It's hard to find XL t-shirt that doesn't shrink to a Medium- Large.,36574,2
36574,The shirts I puchased fell in this category.,36574,2
36574,"It wasn't a total loss, I gave them to my son.",36574,2
36575,Looks and feels like a costume.,36575,2
36575,"Material is very cheap, arm holes are way too big.",36575,2
36575,Would not recommend.,36575,2
36576,This is not sized right at all!,36576,2
36576,I ordered a 2x and I normally wear an x large.,36576,2
36576,When I tried it on it barely covered my chest and there was no way I would be able to zip it.,36576,2
36576,Have to return and the color I want it not available in a three x.,36576,2
36577,had to send this coat back and was really upset cause I really did like it,36577,2
36578,"Nice style but very flimsy ""backpack"".",36578,2
36578,Not strong enough to carry heavy books or a laptop.,36578,2
36578,I returned the one I ordered (charged $9 for shipping).,36578,2
36579,The quality of these shoes are a big disappointment and they are way too shiny...almost like military spit shine or a finish you would wear with a tux.,36579,2
36579,So shiny that I will need to polish and try to dull down some before wearing.,36579,2
36579,"The ""leather"" is super cheap almost like patent leather quality (a couple of grades above plastic)  and I can see that as you walk and the shoe bends naturally, it will quickly crack.",36579,2
36579,"I will keep them because they do fit as expected, my size choices are very limited and these shoes were not very expensive so as long as I wear them sparingly...once every 7-10 days, they should be OK for a year or so and in the meantime I will keep my eye out for a quality pair of wing tips by Johnson & Murphy or Alan Edmonds on sale.",36579,2
36579,"You can wear these shoes all day IF you are sitting at a desk but if you are doing a lot of standing and walking, a couple of hours max should be expected and as for arch support, I have flat feet I'm not someone that can speak to this.",36579,2
36580,This shirt was unwearable.,36580,2
36580,It hung very weird.,36580,2
36580,"Come to think of it, it's also weird to combine ""sweatpants grey,"" with lace.",36580,2
36580,"Not sure what I was thinking when I ordered it, but I sure knew after it arrived.",36580,2
36580,Thumbs down.,36580,2
36581,The purse was smaller than it looks in the photo - I should have paid more attention to the measurements which is my own fault.,36581,2
36581,"But regardless of the size, I still liked the purse..until all of the metal studs started falling off.",36581,2
36581,I really only carry this purse from my room to the car every day.,36581,2
36581,"I leave it in the car while I work and each time I get home and get ready to take it inside, I find another little embellishment laying in my seat.",36581,2
36581,The purse would be great if all of those touches added to enhance the look stayed on.,36581,2
36582,The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames that I don't like.,36582,2
36583,This was nothing like the image provided for this product.,36583,2
36583,The fabric was very thin and the detail looked like it was printed on.,36583,2
36583,Will not buy from this seller again.,36583,2
36584,Girlfriend loved it but fell apart in a month,36584,2
36585,It was much smaller than expected.,36585,2
36586,Beads are red and not the color shown,36586,2
36587,Loved it except it was much much bigger than expected.,36587,2
36587,"Didn't fit where I wanted it,",36587,2
36588,The gold finish rubbed off onto my fingers the first day I wore them.,36588,2
36589,Wayyyyy too large.,36589,2
36589,"Get at least 2 sizes smaller than you need, especially if you're not tall.",36589,2
36589,I'm 5'4 and got a Medium and its way too long.,36589,2
36590,"Just received, and am disappointed.",36590,2
36590,I have many dooney  bags in leather and coated cotton.,36590,2
36590,"This was to be my 1st ""fabric"" bag.",36590,2
36590,Quality was not good and color was completely off.,36590,2
36590,The bag was not stuffed properly and is wrinkled on frontside.,36590,2
36590,The bag also has several snags!,36590,2
36590,Lastly color was not as pictured.,36590,2
36590,I know sometimes color is a little lighter or darker on monitors but this bag is no where near the saddle tan it's supposed to be.,36590,2
36590,It is more of a taupe/gray color.,36590,2
36590,I ordered the marine blue.,36590,2
36590,The leather trim was true to color but the body was not.,36590,2
36590,See pics.,36590,2
36590,Sadly it is going back!,36590,2
36591,"Buy one size up, jacket runs small.",36591,2
36592,Si very small,36592,2
36593,The shoulders are VERY tight.,36593,2
36593,"Everywhere else fits great, which is never a problem I have.",36593,2
36593,I don't like the product and I would not recommend buying it.,36593,2
36593,It looks cheap and feels even cheaper.,36593,2
36594,Wear a size L..,36594,2
36594,Fit like a small..,36594,2
36594,Fabric is thin,36594,2
36595,This blouse fits weird.,36595,2
36595,It's cut normal around the shoulders and then very small around the waist.,36595,2
36595,Almost like a size medium shoulders was sown onto a size extra small mid-section.,36595,2
36596,Fits well but completely sheer/see thru.,36596,2
36596,Ladies take note.,36596,2
36596,"Pictures depict some coverage but I believe ""pasties"" are worn by model.",36596,2
36596,Lace does NOT hide the goodies!,36596,2
36597,Looks better made than it is.,36597,2
36598,cheap,36598,2
36599,I bought them as a gift.,36599,2
36599,I Like the variety of sizes.,36599,2
36599,But i almost didn't want to give them to her.,36599,2
36599,Not impressed with the stone.,36599,2
36599,But ok for the money.,36599,2
36600,"Beautiful Robe, I bought it along with several cotton gowns for a trip to the hospital.",36600,2
36600,Of course I washed them all first.,36600,2
36600,The gowns held up as expected and are nice and soft.,36600,2
36600,This robe however shrank so much I can't wear it.,36600,2
36600,So disappointing!!!,36600,2
36600,I don't feel right about sending it back because it's been laundered.,36600,2
36601,"Cute print, but runs very small through the shoulders.",36601,2
36601,Had to return.,36601,2
36602,Had to return it.,36602,2
36603,Like the swim suit but was bit large I need the medium,36603,2
36604,"The 3 tops were all mediums, but when lying upon one another they were different sizes.",36604,2
36604,Cheap fabric.,36604,2
36605,Concept is cute .,36605,2
36605,The material is poor,36605,2
36606,Didnt get all pieces...no bracelet and cunfusing product,36606,2
36607,I should have gone with my normal size rather than the manufacturers size chart.,36607,2
36607,The dress was way too big.,36607,2
36607,"I am 5'4"" and under 100lbs but my measurements were close to the size 4 on the manufacturers chart.",36607,2
36607,The dress was way too big and I couldn't wear it.,36607,2
36607,I returned the dress,36607,2
36608,too small holds almost nothing,36608,2
36609,ZIPPERS ARE MADE CHEAP AND BROKE IMMEDIATELY.,36609,2
36609,"The zipper that broke is second from the outside on the right, and it was on first use as I was just packing it.",36609,2
36609,Other than that it is a good size compared to the others I've looked at.,36609,2
36609,"Still would have rather gotten this one (even though it looks smaller, I just don't have time to return and order another):

36610,I have mixed feelings about this necklace.,36610,2
36610,"Pros:
-Color is just as advertised

Cons:
-The necklace came broken in the mail.",36610,2
36610,"It is easily but back together but you can tell it is cheaply made
- It does not sit together like the photo.",36610,2
36610,The inner gold/teal necklaces sit higher.,36610,2
36610,I would probably not buy another.,36610,2
36611,"Despite ordering by the sizing chart, it was still too small to wear on anything other than the very largest hole.",36611,2
36612,Nice dress.,36612,2
36612,Very itchy again shows knee length and it's not even close.,36612,2
36613,These glasses were cute but they lean forward at an angle they look silly because of that,36613,2
36614,"The button on the front is breaking away from the case cover after (3) months, I wanted a replacement but am not eligible to get one due to the maximum time for exchanges........My original case lasted more than (3) years.....",36614,2
36615,measurements were not accurate it was way too big.,36615,2
36616,"Beautiful colors and pattern, but it runs very small.",36616,2
36616,2xl fits like a large shirt.,36616,2
36617,When tried on the zipper broke and cannot be fixed.,36617,2
36617,Plus it cannot be returned or exchanged.,36617,2
36618,Cheap quality.,36618,2
36619,"Great colors, but they develop holes after only a couple of wears.",36619,2
36620,My boy loves it due to its fashion color matching with his swimsuits.,36620,2
36620,However it is a little bit worn out just wearing 45 minutes in water play class.,36620,2
36621,"Can only wear for a couple hours, very hard",36621,2
36622,The quality seems nice but it is unbelievable small.,36622,2
36623,Too big.,36623,2
36623,Not the size stated.,36623,2
36624,The pic gave the impression of a formal dress.,36624,2
36624,The fabric seems thick but it's really thin.,36624,2
36624,Going to make some alterations to the back and the slit at the side by adding lace.,36624,2
36624,It fits me similar to how the model looks.,36624,2
36624,It's cheap so I really bother myself about the quality of the fabric .,36624,2
36624,I think they name the type of fabricthat was used and state the quality as well.,36624,2
36625,Charms too big for the chain.,36625,2
36625,Looks like costume jewelry,36625,2
36626,Looks much better on the picture.,36626,2
36626,Material thin,36626,2
36627,The advertised size was off a lot.,36627,2
36627,The did refund me a small %.,36627,2
36627,But I suggest ordering 2 sizes larger than usual.,36627,2
36628,"This is not ""deep plunge"" in the smaller sizes.",36628,2
36628,Won't work for my low cut dress.,36628,2
36628,About the same placement of center band as standard bras.,36628,2
36629,"To be XL is very small , my husband is XL but your XL is very small.",36629,2
36629,I do not like that.,36629,2
36630,Product is over priced.,36630,2
36630,Fabric is thin & transparent.,36630,2
36631,Didn't look exactly like that one.,36631,2
36631,Color was darker and design was different.,36631,2
36632,I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old and couldn't get them on.,36632,2
36632,The thumb holes are extremely tiny.,36632,2
36632,Very disappointed.,36632,2
36633,"I am 186 cm (6,1 ft) and these stays are too short for me.",36633,2
36633,I've tried them with a quite long dress shirt with the straps stretched out at full length and the pull was excessive.,36633,2
36633,Needless to say these stays won't work with a shorter casual shirt.,36633,2
36633,Don't be misled: this product is definitely not one-size-fit-all !,36633,2
36633,!,36633,2
36633,!,36633,2
36634,It fit very small,36634,2
36635,I really like the look and feel of these skirts.,36635,2
36635,I bought them in a large so I could tuck things into them.,36635,2
36635,I was also hoping that a size up would mean extra length.,36635,2
36635,"When I first opened my package, I was really excited to wear them but the problem is that the snaps on these skirts don't really stay closed.",36635,2
36635,They're fine as long as I don't sit down too fast or bend down.,36635,2
36635,But it's honestly a huge hassle to worry about that and move accordingly.,36635,2
36635,"I did figure out that if you wear the skirt with the snaps facing the side (instead of the front, as pictured) then they're less likely to pop open (but still do, occasionally).",36635,2
36635,I eventually just stopped wearing them.,36635,2
36635,"Overall, these skirts are cheap and they look cute but you're probably better off trying something else.",36635,2
36635,It sucks that I can't wear these skirts the way I intended without worrying about public nudity!,36635,2
36635,I'm thinking about getting some buttons and cutting in buttonholes.,36635,2
36636,Don't order a size up I got a median and it was way to big,36636,2
36637,This is the worse body clincher I have ever purchased.,36637,2
36637,"I'm 5'1 and around 150 pounds, in other words I'm short and curvy.",36637,2
36637,When I put on this corset on its works until I move my torso or sit down.,36637,2
36637,When I sit down it starts to bunch in the middle and compile itself in a way that is so painful.,36637,2
36637,When your out in public you can't adjust this thing and you just have to deal with the pain.,36637,2
36637,"It's also not long enough for my torso, and I'm a short person.",36637,2
36637,"I wouldn't buy this again, nor would I recommend it.",36637,2
36638,"I'm 5'11"" and 155lbs and athletic.",36638,2
36638,These fit pretty well actually.,36638,2
36638,They showed through very slightly for particular undergarments but not bad even when I bent over.,36638,2
36638,"I would have accepted this but in the few minutes of trying them on, the seam in the crotch started to come undone.",36638,2
36638,So they would work for someone my size but the quality was just too poor.,36638,2
36639,"I hate leaving bad reviews-- it was my first experience buying something without any reviews and I'll never do that again,....",36639,2
36639,"I'm 5'5"" 135lbs 34d, medium didn't even pull over my head comfortably,..",36639,2
36639,It was $16 so I chalked it up ad a Loss and just threw it away it was that small.,36639,2
36640,I wasn't very impressed.,36640,2
36640,The colors did not look as crisp as I thought they would.,36640,2
36640,The colors looked like they had been bleached by the sun.,36640,2
36640,And the strap that ties up around my neck is off center so the flower is off to the left.,36640,2
36640,For that reason alone I'll never wear it.,36640,2
36640,It will drive me nuts!,36640,2
36640,The material is much thinner than I expected.,36640,2
36640,I have similar dresses that I bought at a beach shop and they are way better!,36640,2
36640,it almost looks like crepe paper.,36640,2
36641,One size fits most but not all.,36641,2
36641,"I went in really liking this shirt, even if it is pretty thin and cheap.",36641,2
36641,It gets the job done for 1 night.,36641,2
36641,"BUT, Sleeves too short and i felt like the Hulk trying not to rip the back/sleeve seams.",36641,2
36641,"Oh well, im gonna go salvage and stitch pieces of it to make my own out of a henly.",36641,2
36642,"I really loved the suit and fit, ordered a medium when I usually wear an XS, but the top mesh arrived ripped.",36642,2
36642,So that's really disappointing,36642,2
36643,Too large and slippery vinyl.,36643,2
36643,Not how I imagined.,36643,2
36643,Too bad cause the color is great.,36643,2
36644,"The Jeans fit however, the black bled into my socks even after washing the jeans.",36644,2
36644,I wasn't very satisfied with this purchase.,36644,2
36645,Material was more night shirt than dress wear.,36645,2
36645,It was very thin material and did not shape well.,36645,2
36645,I ended up sending it back for a full refund.,36645,2
36646,"Didn't know this was dry clean only, and the steelers emblem doesn't look good.",36646,2
36646,"You can tell they blew up a picture and printed it, very blurry.",36646,2
36647,the dress is very thin and see through,36647,2
36648,"They're fun to pass around at shows, but they're heavy to wear on your head.",36648,2
36648,You may get a headache if you want to wear them for extended periods of time.,36648,2
36648,The first time I wore them they fell of my head due to it's weight and one of the lenses go a huge chip in the glass.,36648,2
36648,They were still wearable.,36648,2
36648,they're a fun conversation piece but practical to wear and can get annoying to hold.,36648,2
36649,Larger than I expected,36649,2
36650,Material was ok.,36650,2
36650,But size was ridiculously small.,36650,2
36650,I ordered a medium and it had to be at least a X Small if not a size 14 in kids.,36650,2
36651,Two stars because I've owned and currently own multiple pairs of Carhartt pants over many years and these run small in the waist.,36651,2
36651,I cannot wear them without undue discomfort therefore are worthless to me.,36651,2
36651,I don't understand why the same company would vary in size?,36651,2
36651,"I have heard of this happening with other brands needless to say, a review is a review, just that.",36651,2
36651,Furthermore I own other brands in the same size with no problem for fit and comfort.,36651,2
36651,"These are actually waste size 32"" or possibly smaller not 33"" Loose Fit Canvas Carpenter Five Pocket pants.",36651,2
36651,"Other than that no complaints, they're pants.",36651,2
36652,Cheap,36652,2
36653,Wrinkles in dryer.,36653,2
36653,Hem is twisted.,36653,2
36653,Not a satisfactory purchase.,36653,2
36654,I usually wear a men's medium hat.,36654,2
36654,This hat is enormous- almost comically large.,36654,2
36655,They didn't fit the way I thought they would.,36655,2
36656,Way Too Long and Way Too Tight!!,36656,2
36656,"I looked like a short green overstuffed sausage with my shirt's ""Irish Pride"" in my pants!!",36656,2
36656,Am now looking for a tall skinny friend ...,36656,2
36657,Not the support I was expecting.,36657,2
36658,Fabric is cheap but worst of all the pocket slits in the side weren't big enough to get my hand in - probably only about 4 inches long.,36658,2
36658,"There's a pocket there, but you can't get your hand in it.",36658,2
36659,with a XXL in the same exact style as the blue one advertised i am not satisfied with the size given.,36659,2
36659,Not a true XXL,36659,2
36660,It cuts into my back and it doesn't fit right.,36660,2
36660,I can't wear it.,36660,2
36661,"Very different from picture and disappointing, would not recommend unless you want something to wear when going to sleep.",36661,2
36662,They were way too big,36662,2
36663,Not everything perfect to wear.,36663,2
36663,One end will not stay in place/screwed in.,36663,2
36663,Should I try more?,36663,2
36664,"Good quality, but WOW runs very very small.",36664,2
36664,"I ordered the 18 mo size (thinking I would use it next year), and it already fits my 4 mo old baby!",36664,2
36665,It's a nice-looking shirt but I gave it to my friend he's smaller than me.,36665,2
36665,If you wear a double XL.,36665,2
36665,Don't even bother ordering this because they won't have one in your size.,36665,2
36665,I got the 5xl.,36665,2
36665,"Not to mention, this shirt came so far in advance, I had actually forgotten I even ordered it.",36665,2
36666,It fit way too big according to the picture online.,36666,2
36667,It was larger than expected.,36667,2
36667,But the customer support was Excellent in understanding the issue.,36667,2
36668,Was looking for an Iphone 6s case not a 6s plus,36668,2
36669,Here's the thing.,36669,2
36669,I LOVED THE PRODUCT RESULTS.,36669,2
36669,BUT I have had this product for a week.,36669,2
36669,And it has already broken.,36669,2
36669,Haven't event washed it yet.,36669,2
36669,"And for the cost, for a week of wear, I am so very disappointed that it already has to go in the trash.",36669,2
36669,And unfortunately I cannot get myself to buy it again knowing it won't last.,36669,2
36670,Not really sure how this could be used for a tragus as it has a screw on ball on the back of it.,36670,2
36670,"I tried for a while, with no luck.",36670,2
36670,Maybe I have small ears?,36670,2
36671,Didn't like the fit too narrow at the waist,36671,2
36672,did not realize it was embellished with an embroidery design.,36672,2
36672,"That did not show in the photo, so I have given it to my sister.",36672,2
36672,Was not what I expected.,36672,2
36673,"I'm giving 2 stars because it wasn't misleading... but, the size is ineffective if you actually use the chart.",36673,2
36673,I have a size 40 waist... it expands too much leaving it ineffective.,36673,2
36673,I through it straight in the trash!,36673,2
36673,I should've ordered for 3-4 sizes smaller.,36673,2
36673,I've decided to NOT repurchase this item.,36673,2
36674,I ordered a Large and it was too small.,36674,2
36674,I returned it.,36674,2
36675,Ok,36675,2
36676,Wasn't what I was expecting did not fit on shoulders,36676,2
36677,Cute but fell apart in 6 months after normal use.,36677,2
36678,why is there no return label for this product is does not fit as expected,36678,2
36679,"These aren't sox, they're old man hose.",36679,2
36679,Traveling?,36679,2
36679,Buy some damn sox!,36679,2
36680,small,36680,2
36681,I read the reviews about the sizing of the dress and ordered larger; but it was still a bit tight.,36681,2
36681,"I love the dress, but too small and had to give it to a friend sadly.",36681,2
36681,This is an overseas dress found it on Wish and other foreign sites online.,36681,2
36681,The quality is definitely not from the USA.,36681,2
36682,"Stem is too short, will not even fit a kid well.",36682,2
36683,"Fit was alright everywhere but the sleeve, too tight at the bottom but fixable.",36683,2
36684,"Since I started wearing these shoes, I have had trouble with my knees.",36684,2
36685,I wanted to love this shirt so much.,36685,2
36685,I really really did.,36685,2
36685,I used their measurements and ordered a 14 only to recieve a top that as WAY too big!,36685,2

36685,"It is much better to just go to the Jessica London site directly, if you're willing to pay Jessica London prices.",36685,2
36685,I pretty much paid $8 just to try this top on and send it back and Nd up with nothing.,36685,2
36685,"Size aside, the top was nice.",36685,2
36685,The material was thinner than expected but still nice.,36685,2
36685,It might be the type of material you would expect given the price however it would be a comfortable summer top.,36685,2
36686,"Not very happy with this product, it doesn't look as nice as in the pic.",36686,2

36687,Returned it.,36687,2
36688,Weird fit.,36688,2
36688,Impossible.,36688,2
36689,color is not as vibrants as photoshopped picture.,36689,2
36689,Also the elastic bands on the side to hold up the flaps are really difficult to hook on.,36689,2
36689,Can't imagine doing that in the cold with gloves on.,36689,2
36689,"Could be better, oh well.",36689,2
36690,"Used by four times and broke after, too small.",36690,2

36692,Not recommend,36692,2
36693,"For a $10 T-shirt shirt, I suppose I pretty much got what I paid for.",36693,2
36693,Which isn't much.,36693,2
36693,"Ordered the shirt in large, they gave me a small.",36693,2
36693,"The shirt has a strong smell, like it's been sprayed with something.",36693,2
36693,And the logo / power ranger stuff looks like it's about ready to peel off before I've even worn it.,36693,2
36693,"Not quite sure what all the other reviews are raving about, I'm fairly ticked off.",36693,2
36693,This was supposed to be a bomb Christmas present.,36693,2

36695,ridiculous !,36695,2
36696,Took some time to get from china.,36696,2
36696,At first I liked the shape and the frame and especially the long temples.,36696,2
36696,"But after wearing for some time I discovered a big negative - the lens height is very small and since this is a bifocal lens, any slight movement of the eye down goes into the magnifying zone and is very uncomfortable.",36696,2
36696,I had to look straight up to not bump into the magnifier.,36696,2
36696,This became unbearable to view through that I stopped using them after just one day.,36696,2
36697,"Material would be to hot to wear as pajamas,also fit to low on the waist for my liking",36697,2
36698,Top fit ok skirt was too big,36698,2

36703,"But, Within one wash the sleeve ripped.",36703,2
36703,:(,36703,2
36704,It runs small in the chest and large on the arms.,36704,2
36704,The fabric is a lil cheap it's not soft at all.,36704,2
36704,M,36704,2
36705,"Cheap material, nothing like whats on the model, disappointed.",36705,2
36706,Too small - and I triple-checked the size chart.,36706,2
36706,Order one size larger than you think and you should be good.,36706,2
36706,"Also, this material isn't really that great.",36706,2
36706,I wouldn't buy this again even if the size were correct.,36706,2
36707,didn't like style.,36707,2
36707,plain and a bit boring,36707,2

36712,I need a medium then.,36712,2
36713,I love the pattern but the material is very thin almost see through and they ran a little small for me.,36713,2
36714,I ordered this and promptly returned it.,36714,2
36714,"While the fabric quality is nice, I think the sizing is misleading.",36714,2
36714,"I bought a black sweater labelled as size 18, but the sleeves were clearly meant for a much smaller person.",36714,2
36714,This is meant for someone who's maybe a size 6-10 who wants an oversized tunic.,36714,2
36715,I washed it before wearing it and it has two holes on it now.,36715,2
36715,Very cheap material,36715,2
36716,I am tall.,36716,2
36716,It have a short torso and this looks nothing like the image.,36716,2
36716,And it has a very weird smell.,36716,2
36716,I'm guessing it's the packaging.,36716,2
36716,I am 5 10 and was hoping this would cover my tooshie and it barely clears the top of my pants.,36716,2
36716,If you wear a size 12 you really want to get a size  XL.,36716,2
36716,I would have liked a an XXL,36716,2
36717,"I know colors on the internet are difficult to determine, but this tie appears black with the red striping on my screen, and it's most definitely not black in person.",36717,2
36717,Almost more a dark maroon and the striping is almost orangish.,36717,2
36717,"Not to mention that it is called a ""Red Black Stripe"" tie.",36717,2
36717,But my biggest beef with this tie is the width.,36717,2
36717,"The description says ""Width: 3.35"" (8.5cm) at widest""  This tie is a full 4"" wide at the tip.",36717,2
36717,This is very odd looking and disappointing.,36717,2
36717,I was so encouraged with the good reviews.,36717,2
36717,"I definitely did not get what I was expecting, and will be returning this purchase.",36717,2
36718,Works okay on flat faces.,36718,2
36718,Puts a lot of pressure on my nose.,36718,2
36719,Cute shirt but runs extremely small.,36719,2
36719,I'm typically a 16-18 so I ordered a 3x since I'm larger in the chest area.,36719,2
36719,But the shirt was so small that I couldn't even get it over my arms and head.,36719,2
36720,Made in China,36720,2
36721,"Unfortunately, I have wide feet, tough to get on and were not comfortable.",36721,2
36722,"Right fits ""OK"".",36722,2
36722,Left was made incorrectly - thong was attached to the sole incorrectly.,36722,2
36722,Left is very loose fitting.,36722,2
36722,Will only wear these Flip Flops as shower shoes.,36722,2
36722,Will not buy this product again from this seller.,36722,2
36723,"very cute, shipped fast but broke after only 2 days",36723,2
36724,Okay,36724,2
36725,"It's okay, but the strings are a little bit loose and it isn't swimsuit material.",36725,2
36726,It was really pretty.,36726,2
36726,I wore it a few times.,36726,2
36726,The stone just fell out and is gone.,36726,2
36726,"I know opals are pretty delicate, so I was very careful with it.",36726,2
36726,"I would have thought the settings would have kept it secure, or the stone would have been glued in.",36726,2
36726,I'm pretty disappointed.,36726,2
36727,The colors are not what the picture represents,36727,2
36728,Too large for my 2 year old.,36728,2
36729,Bag is roomy and looks cool.,36729,2
36729,Slightly smaller than I expected.,36729,2
36729,I found the inner zipper for miscellaneous stuff in an awkward location.,36729,2
36729,Won't be able to put things in that I don't want to move around AND poking at my upper back at the same time.,36729,2
36729,Back pack has very little inner structure.,36729,2
36729,Very droopy and will not keep its shape when stood upright.,36729,2
36729,Convenient location of the pen holders but wished there was a flap to hold the other pockets in.,36729,2
36729,Maybe it's the way the materials are but adjusting the shoulder straps aren't as easy.,36729,2
36729,Shoulder straps need more padding.,36729,2
36729,Zippers feel cheap and doesn't slide easy all the time.,36729,2
36729,Zippers are similar to H&M zipper jackets.,36729,2
36729,All in all it looks better than it functions.,36729,2
36729,Needs refinement.,36729,2
36730,"They were very cute, but are not as big as the picture makes them to be.",36730,2
36730,"I have bigger boobs, so I always need bigger bars.",36730,2
36730,These are meant for girls with smaller boobs.,36730,2
36731,Not like the picture at all.,36731,2
36731,That's why I'm Very disappointed.,36731,2
36731,"It's tolerable but the buttons on it is big and dark brown, not gold buttons like shown.",36731,2
36731,And the selves on this does not roll up like the picture.,36731,2
36731,Tried it on and yes It fits perfectly.,36731,2
36731,I do like it even though the Material is a different blue from the picture more of a darker blue.,36731,2
36731,"I'm a size 16 and height is 5""8.",36731,2
36731,I weigh 211 and got an XXL.,36731,2
36731,I will be dressing this up with some cute jewelry to bring it out.,36731,2
36731,Will post a pic later whenever I decide to wear it.,36731,2
36732,It is a beautiful thing.,36732,2
36732,The stone is so large it reeks of not being authentic.,36732,2
36732,It didn't seem that large in the picture.,36732,2
36733,"I like the pattern and colors, but it's quite small and uncomfortable",36733,2
36734,Gave this dress to my daughter because I thought a medium be large enough because I usually wear about a 5 but it was tight at the chest and tight at the ass and not really appropriate without leggings or something underneath it.,36734,2
36735,Love the design but the colors on the shirt I received are extremely faded and look nothing like the picture.,36735,2
36735,The shirt size runs a bit small but otherwise seems like a decent thickness and material.,36735,2
36735,Would return it due to the faded color but since it was so cheap and was shipped from China I decided it wasn't worth the hassle,36735,2
36736,Sheds a ton!,36736,2
36736,My floor is covered in white feathers and the boa isn't even all the way out of the plastic packaging yet.,36736,2
36736,:(,36736,2
36737,looks more gold than yellow.,36737,2
36737,Was too small.,36737,2
36738,I like the dress a little on the small size so who ever order try two sizes biger,36738,2
36739,"Very pretty, but please keep in mind that the pattern is not symmetrical on both sides.",36739,2
36739,"I found that they were too short for me, I am 5'6"".",36739,2
36740,"This sign looks great at a quick glance, however upon closer inspection I failed to realize part of it is mispelled.",36740,2
36740,I will say the seller has an accurate picture that includes the flaw but I just didn't think they would openly sell them without acknowledging it.,36740,2
36740,So final conclusion: if you don't mind the word 'that's ' being spelled 'that't ' it's great.,36740,2
36741,Sizes are weird,36741,2
36742,It's kinda cheep.,36742,2
36742,The neutral shoe polish twist opener popped off on first use.,36742,2
36742,The brush covers are flimsey.,36742,2
36743,WASTE OF $$,36743,2

36744,"It did fit as expected according to the chart but the bra cup is very thick, hard and kind of pointy.",36744,2
36745,The shirt seems fine but runs very small.,36745,2
36745,The sleeves were so tight for my husband.,36745,2
36745,"I kept the shirt for myself, so a men's large fits a woman who or ally wears a medium.",36745,2
36746,"Has a weird pocket design that hits right at the outer thigh, like anyone wants that.",36746,2
36746,"Even though I bought it bigger than what I'd normally wear so it would be loose and comfy, it was super big throughout the upper part of the dress yet super short.",36746,2
36746,"Didn't even hit the top of my ankles and I'm 5'8"".",36746,2
36746,"The shoulder straps are adjustable, and there is a back zipper, however it still remained too big up top to wear.",36746,2
36746,"Even had it fit like it should've, the pockets and too-short length were just a deal-breaker for me.",36746,2
36746,Had to return.,36746,2
36747,"Cute, but too small.",36747,2
36748,I was disappointed when I put on this dress and it was way too big.,36748,2

36748,I returned it.,36748,2
36748,Though the color is very pretty!,36748,2
36749,"Quality seems good, but the large size is still too snug on my size 5/6 daughter.",36749,2
36750,Was disproportionate.,36750,2
36750,fit except for shoulders and boob cups were set very wide apart.,36750,2
36750,would have been cute except fit was wonky.,36750,2
36751,Not for me,36751,2
36752,Unable to wear also,36752,2
36753,It made me look fat.,36753,2
36753,I haven't worn it out once.,36753,2
36753,The cut or the style is just not right for me.,36753,2
36753,"Might look ok on others, but just not for me.",36753,2
36754,Not sized right.,36754,2
36754,Too big for a size 16.,36754,2
36754,Loose elastic even if sized right.,36754,2
36754,Bra doesn't fit comfortably.,36754,2
36755,"stiff, uncomfortable material.",36755,2
36755,"photo makes it look flowy, boho, but it's stiff like a cheap hotel pillowcase",36755,2
36756,It's really short.,36756,2
36756,I'm usually a 0-2 and the lining underneath is way too short.,36756,2
36756,I wouldn't wear this anywhere other than the beach.,36756,2
36756,It's cheap and I got what I paid for I guess so I'm not complaining but if you're looking for a decent quality sundress this is not the one to get.,36756,2
36757,These earrings do not look exactly as the picture!,36757,2
36757,They hang downwards I was so disappointed when they arrived.,36757,2
36758,I wear a 34D and bought these in a Medium.,36758,2
36758,I always have trouble with sports bras because I'm busty with a small waist.,36758,2
36758,It's hard to find ones that fit my waist but don't suffocate the girls.,36758,2
36758,These don't really fit right either.,36758,2
36758,They felt uncomfortably tight when I first put them on but then kinda stretched out after a few minutes.,36758,2
36758,They're not very supportive and are cut really low.,36758,2
36758,I felt like I might have popped out.,36758,2
36758,I ended up returning these.,36758,2
36759,The size didn't fit how it should have fitted for the size it was.,36759,2
36760,I am an 36 dd and a large did not fit.,36760,2
36760,It's cheap material but you get what you pay for.,36760,2

36763,I like the idea of comfort after giving birth but I tried this on and felt like an old grandma.,36763,2
36763,"I wanted something that would make it easy to nurse while giving me a ""pretty and effortless"" look.",36763,2
36763,I know some may like this style but I prefer a design that is more flattering.,36763,2
36764,VERY small.,36764,2
36764,I usually wear a size 8 yet ordered a large due to previous reviews.,36764,2
36764,Very tight in the bodice  - too tight to zip.,36764,2
36764,Also sheer - afraid I would tear the fabric if the zipper was forced.,36764,2
36764,Too bad because the design is very appealing.,36764,2
36765,is just too small.,36765,2
36765,"Specially on the arm, can't even wear it.",36765,2
36765,I guess this is more of Asian sizing.,36765,2
36765,Maybe an XL fit.,36765,2
36766,Glasses felt like you bought them at a $ store.,36766,2

36787,The fit was small and the overall effect was that's cheap looking.,36787,2
36788,You get what you pay for.,36788,2
36788,"They aren't leather like at all, more like fabric.",36788,2
36788,"They came in wrinkled, and several weeks later, my husband is still yet to get this wrinkles out.",36788,2
36788,Wouldn't recommend buying.,36788,2
36789,Fit way too small.,36789,2
36790,"I am a 5'7"" Asian and this skirt comes a bit short, above my ankle.",36790,2
36790,"Am rather disappointed, especially where the material is concerned; it says cotton linen blend and I wear only cotton or linen, but although the fabric is light and see through thin it's not breathable.",36790,2
36791,Product performed as expected.,36791,2
36791,My hair bands often slip off the bracelet so I had to stop using it.,36791,2
36791,Not sure if you need to be using special/specific hair bands for it to stay on the Bracelet.,36791,2
36792,Cheap stinky and not cute,36792,2
36793,I have a 3 month old who is in the process of sleep training.,36793,2
36793,"He gets frustrated when he can't fall asleep and will start rubbing his face, eyes and head.",36793,2
36793,"Even with cut nails, he will still leave scratch marks on himself.",36793,2
36793,I bought these mittens in hope that my baby will not be able to scratch himself.,36793,2
36793,I love the fact that these mittens are made with organic cotton but they are not soft!,36793,2
36793,"After a couple a washes, the fabric became even rougher and they even pill!",36793,2
36793,I only use the most natural laundry detergent (rated safest by EWG) and I hang dry the mittens.,36793,2
36793,I am also not a fan of the velcro.,36793,2
36793,The gloves fell off before he even fell asleep maybe because of all the turning and rubbing so I tightened the Velcro area.,36793,2
36793,"When you tighten that area, a little part of the Velcro is exposed and that part scratched my child's face!",36793,2
36793,It's cheaper and safer to just put socks over your baby's hands to prevent scratching.,36793,2
36793,"Update August 9,2016:
Seller sent email asking for 5 star review.",36793,2
36793,This is against Amazon's policy.,36793,2

36796,top was way too small.,36796,2
36796,(I'm a 36D)  Bottoms were too large.,36796,2
36796,"As far as quality goes, it was well made with good material.",36796,2
36797,fabric cheap looking.,36797,2
36798,I loved the top part but was not expecting the bottom part to be so wide,36798,2
36799,It turned black :( is very pretty,36799,2
36800,Could not get on the size chart to compare sizes.,36800,2
36800,You need to make it easier to access a size chart.,36800,2
36801,I have small ankles and this was too small.,36801,2
36801,Couldn't believe how small they made it.,36801,2
36801,Pretty but not worth buying unless it's for a younger girl.,36801,2
36802,Order one and broke the same day.,36802,2
36802,Received a replacement and broke a week later.,36802,2

36805,I TAKE A 12-14 AND THESE WERE MADE MORE LIKE 10-12!!,36805,2
36805,VERY UNHAPPY WIRH MY PURCHASE.,36805,2
36805,AND TO RETURN YOU HAVE TO ORDER SOMETHING ELSE AND SPEND MORE MONEY FOR NEW GYM PANTS OR WHEN YOU RETURN WAIT TILL MONEY GOES BACK INTO YOUR ACCOUNT TO GET SOMETHING ELSE!!,36805,2
36805,EITHER WAY YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY AGAIN!,36805,2
36805,LADIES I WOULD THING TWICE BEFORE I GET THESE PANTS THAT ARE NOT LIKE GYM PANTS AT ALL!!,36805,2
36805,NOT A GOOD PURCHASE.,36805,2
36806,Lens too dark,36806,2
36807,Too wide and material is too cheap,36807,2
36808,"Only one word for this necklace, chintzy.",36808,2
36808,Cheaply made.,36808,2
36809,sleeves are short for this size,36809,2
36810,It was cute just the smallest size large I have ever tried on.,36810,2
36811,Bought this for my daughter.,36811,2
36811,It is not a medium like she normally wears (much smaller/tighter).,36811,2
36811,"The fabric is very thin, almost see-through.",36811,2
36812,When I got the the top there was a defect in the material.,36812,2
36812,A white line where the ink in the material didn't connect or complete.,36812,2
36812,Couldn't wear it.,36812,2
36812,:(,36812,2
36813,Runs small,36813,2
36814,I love wrap tops but this top was way too large and the material was flimsy and thin.,36814,2
36814,Maybe if I ordered in a smaller size and any color but white but all of that is not worth bothering.,36814,2
36815,This shirt was too short in length.,36815,2
36816,"Beautiful shirt but...
Too short
Too small",36816,2
36817,Material is like cardboard.,36817,2
36817,Not very good but it does look like the picture.,36817,2
36818,It's bit bright - so if you like to stand out than this is the color for you!,36818,2
36819,"I have a pair of these that are allegedly the same size, but these ones are at least a full size bigger.",36819,2
36819,"Obnoxious that the sizes have changed so much, especially for someone with very small feet.",36819,2
36819,I have enough trouble finding shoes that fit without dealing with insane variations in actual sizes.,36819,2
36820,A bit short for my style and material feels inexpensive.,36820,2
36820,Planned to wear this under my uniforms but the lace trim felt scratchy.,36820,2
36821,"Buy a size larger, otherwise they look great",36821,2
36822,"Its too thick on angle and causes some discomfort while sleeping, for example.",36822,2
36822,"However, mine broke in one week, so...",36822,2
36822,It was a total disappointment.,36822,2
36823,"I found this to be very uncomfortable and tight, even as a smaller person very early on in pregnancy.",36823,2
36823,Disappointed!,36823,2
36824,The Blue color shown is not the color I received.,36824,2
36824,It is more the sapphire / royal blue color that they advertise.,36824,2
36824,The picture reflects more of an aqua blue.,36824,2
36824,unfortunately i do not have time to return it or exchange my items so i will have to make it work.,36824,2
36825,"I'm usually a medium, I ordered a large and it was still tight and slightly on the short side.",36825,2
36826,"Great print, soft fabric but doesn't have much stretch, which is important for baby clothes.",36826,2
36827,I really wanted to like this hat.,36827,2
36827,I liked that I could tie it together and that it covered the neck.,36827,2
36827,"The hat falls flat on his face, so this hat does not serve its purpose.",36827,2
36827,I would not but it again.,36827,2
36828,Beautiful fabric.,36828,2
36828,Don't understand the rating that the size runs as expected.,36828,2
36828,The computer didn't ask me if it was right.,36828,2
36828,Which it wasn't.,36828,2
36828,"The XL fits like an undersized large, meaning not only is it too tight, it is waaaay short.",36828,2
36828,Waste of money.,36828,2
36829,The sizes are too small,36829,2
36830,I am a US women's size small and ordered a large based on other reviews and the sizing chart.,36830,2
36830,The fit is great.,36830,2
36830,However the quality of this product is sub par.,36830,2
36830,The open shoulder is much larger of a space than what is depicted in the picture.,36830,2
36830,The sleeve starts halfway down my arm.,36830,2
36830,The color and quality of the fabric is completely different than expected based on the images.,36830,2
36830,I ordered the red top and the color is dull and dingy.,36830,2
36830,The fabric is stiff and thick.,36830,2
36830,I expected a nice top for a date night but I will probably never wear it based on the appearance.,36830,2
36831,"This piece of shi is cheaply made, and it squeezes my body.",36831,2
36831,I have red marks on my skin from wearing this bikini for 2 hours.,36831,2
36831,Doesn't cover my entire butt.,36831,2
36831,Why didn't I just purchase a thong bikini.,36831,2
36831,"The fabric, or cheap material, isn't really water proof.",36831,2
36831,There are random stains on the front of the bottoms after using it for one pool swim.,36831,2
36831,I didn't even do anything.,36831,2
36831,Weird.,36831,2
36831,"Otherwise, it's cute, and cheap.",36831,2
36831,"Ship in the winter time, if you want it by summer.",36831,2
36831,And get a size up.,36831,2
36831,Don't expect greatness.,36831,2
36832,I had to return it.,36832,2
36832,Upon washing it for the first time showed stain probably from the rusty metal part in the rattle inside.,36832,2
36833,Sent it back as it was too big to be flattering.,36833,2
36834,LOOK VERY PLASTIC,36834,2
36835,Not a great snapback,36835,2
36836,"I ordered a size up due to reviews, which is good, but is still unproportional.",36836,2
36836,The top part fit nice but the bottom what too short in length and very wide.,36836,2
36836,This is very see through material.,36836,2
36836,The buttons also come off very easily so I had to sew them back on.,36836,2
36836,Can't return because it costs too much to ship back.,36836,2
36837,The lining is way to short.,36837,2
36837,I'm using it as a beach coverup.,36837,2
36837,The color is glow in the dark coral.,36837,2
36837,May be ok for young teenager but thats about it.,36837,2
36838,This bracelet arrived in a plain envelope with not so much as any bubble wrap or anything to protect it.,36838,2
36838,"Disappointed in the quality of the bracelet as well, says it is a girls bracelet but is very large and falls off my extra large wrist.",36838,2
36839,I am giving this a rating of 2 because it IS a cute dress.,36839,2
36839,"However, per the norm for clothing made in China, it's too small.",36839,2
36839,"I'm trying to find a way to identify the country of manufacture prior to buying, but have yet to be successful, a reason why I am cutting way back on ordering clothing from Amazon.",36839,2
36839,It's a scam and I've already lost money.,36839,2
36840,There was no bottoms to this at all.,36840,2
36840,Basically sent me a cheaply made sun dress.,36840,2
36840,No impressed.,36840,2
36841,"I got the wrong size I guess, I went based on the size chart.....guess I'll trade for a bigger size",36841,2

36842,"It could just be me, but I didn't like it.",36842,2
36843,Love it,36843,2
36844,Fit as expected but it's very thin and collects lint like crazy,36844,2
36845,The fit was very small.,36845,2
36845,I didn't care for the style either.,36845,2
36845,It looks much better on the model than it did on my more athletic body.,36845,2
36846,Very big and sits on your back weirdly.. some parts fell apart after 2 weeks :( Very dessipointed..,36846,2
36847,I like these a lot but I was a sent a white tank top instead of a blue one.,36847,2
36847,"I was not able to exchange the tank top so I have to return the whole order, get a refund, and then order a new set.",36847,2
36847,I find this to be rather annoying.,36847,2
36847,I am still deciding if I should reorder or find something else.,36847,2
36848,I ordered the teal and blue in a 2xl it's too small and short I'm 5'11 and I weigh 250lbs I want to love this set but it didn't work prior to me ordering the 2xl I order a 1xl and it fits the same I don't get it it's tight around the waist and I don't have no stomach and the length come to my ankle the sizing it way off order two size up for lenfht,36848,2

36854,"Material is SO rigid and has no give which I understand why, but I wish there was some elasticity in it.",36854,2
36854,Will be returning this item,36854,2
36855,"The top fits perfectly but the bottom is too small, I bought a S and a M planning on returning one and they are both too small.",36855,2
36855,There isn't a noticeable difference between the size S and M,36855,2
36856,"Cute, but material is cheap, it sucks.",36856,2
36856,Will be returning,36856,2
36857,"I'm 5'2"" and this flares out my dress in an unflattering way.",36857,2
36857,Making me look bigger than I am and I wear a size 0!!,36857,2
36857,"I got it because of the cute lace design but when it came, I didn't even notice the lace because the roughness of the tulle had me sending this back.",36857,2
36858,"Fit is accurate and comfortable,  but stitching is an issue.",36858,2

36859,"pretty colors, but they fall out very easy the backs are very loose.",36859,2
36860,"I bought this with the intention of this product sticking to surfaces like the mirror, it will stick for a few seconds and then just fall off.",36860,2
36860,Not worth it for the anti gravity factor.,36860,2
36860,"As for a plain clear case, it works great.",36860,2
36861,I sent it back as it was dark looked wrong with the shiny new silver charms.,36861,2
36861,If they made one shiny I would grab it!,36861,2
36862,the dress style is pretty.,36862,2
36862,"i loved how light it felt but not enough to keep it because it feels cheaply made, it also feels so thin that although i bought a dark color, i feel like it is so thin to almost sheer, poor quality.",36862,2
36862,i was disappointed because i was really looking forward to wearing this dress.,36862,2
36862,it looks so cure online.,36862,2
36863,Love the look when it first arrived.,36863,2
36863,"However, quality is what you would get at Walmart.",36863,2
36863,"Actually, some hoodies I have purchased at Walmart were better.",36863,2
36863,You are actually paying for the print.,36863,2
36863,"After washing once, already started showing wear.",36863,2
36863,Attracts dog hair and lint like a magnet.,36863,2
36863,Would not re-purchase.,36863,2
36864,"The shirt was soft but the applique must have been off or the shirt stitching/seams were off, because the pumpkin sits off center.",36864,2
36864,I tried to shift the shirt and it would go right back to where it was.,36864,2
36865,My 13-year-old son paid for these with his own money.,36865,2
36865,"They look great, feel good, and fit well, but my son wore holes in both big toes within a week of owning them.",36865,2
36865,He's never had socks do that before.,36865,2
36865,"After spending so much money on one pair of socks, he swore he would never buy socks just for the brand name again--especially this brand.",36865,2

36869,The silver tones are different.,36869,2
36869,The chain color does not match the charm.,36869,2
36869,The charm was very pretty but the chain made it look cheap.,36869,2
36870,Was cute but faded after the first wash and each watch after that,36870,2
36871,I would love this so much more if it came  In a smaller size.,36871,2
36871,After washing it few times  on my shoulder it's hard to come undone.,36871,2
36871,I was little disappointed but I can't expect much for couple bucks.,36871,2
36871,I just wear around the house.,36871,2
36872,"Alright, I was so excited to get this in the mail.",36872,2
36872,It was exactly what I was looking for and looked really great.,36872,2
36872,"And after reading the reviews, I ordered a larger size because it ran tiny.",36872,2
36872,I take a M in normal clothes.,36872,2
36872,"I bought an XXL, the biggest size they have.",36872,2
36872,It's still too tiny.,36872,2
36872,"I am able to wear it, but because I have large arms, it barely fits over my bicep, and it's super tight around my shoulders.",36872,2
36872,"This isn't even Asian sizing, this is CHILDREN'S sizing.",36872,2
36872,The material is slightly see-through and it feels nothing like a soft cotton.,36872,2
36872,I am so so disappointed.,36872,2
36872,Please think twice about buying this.,36872,2
36873,Not as expected or described.,36873,2
36873,"I am 5'5"" and 140lbs.",36873,2
36873,I typically wear 9 in juniors pants and 4 in women's.,36873,2
36873,I thought the large would fit given the sizing chart provided.,36873,2
36873,The bottoms cut in my sides and did the opposite of looking sexy.,36873,2
36873,The top was cute however!,36873,2
36873,But what good is a suite with 1/2 of it working?,36873,2
36873,Do not waste your money!,36873,2
36873,I just filled return request.,36873,2
36873,Invest in a higher quality suit/ one you can try on better.,36873,2
36874,"My friend highly recommended this..however, i found it uncomfortable and my baby didn't seem to like it during the pregnancy.",36874,2
36874,"But, it may have been because she was already so low (head down) that it was putting pressure on her.",36874,2
36874,Even loosening it didn't seem to help.,36874,2
36875,"Not a winter coat, no warmth at all",36875,2
36876,"Quality of the cloth is just okay, not very great.",36876,2
36876,"The delivery was over delayed, which actually made me thought of cancelling the order",36876,2
36877,The sleeves are little long.,36877,2
36877,It doesn't have a zip out lining.,36877,2
36877,A zip out lining would add more time to wear the coat.,36877,2
36877,I tried to return it but UPS said it would cost me $170.00!,36877,2
36878,OK for a 4-7 year old but is listed for a teen.,36878,2
36878,Picture fabric stains when anything gets on it,36878,2
36879,Cute dress but was very tight.,36879,2
36879,There were holes in several places in the lace.,36879,2
36879,I had to return.,36879,2
36880,Toooooo smaaaallll,36880,2
36881,The purse looks very nice.,36881,2
36881,Just like how it look displayed on the picture..,36881,2
36881,The only thing I wasn't so happy with was the fact that it looked used.,36881,2
36881,The tag was ripped off &* it had two scratched on the back of the bag &* a lught scuff on the side of the bag messing up the holigram feature.,36881,2
36881,Like as if it was used before I purchased it.,36881,2
36881,&* I didn't buy it used.,36881,2
36881,It was supposed to be brand new.,36881,2
36881,So disappointed.,36881,2
36882,Runs EXTREAMLY small.,36882,2
36882,"Ordered a large, was able to fit my size 4 room mate, so I guess she has a new pair of leggings.",36882,2
36882,"BUT, they are made well, couldn't find a flaw in them, and on the positive side, they aren't like the normal fake leather pants, they actually let your legs breath, and they don't feel like they are suffocating, and I have a pretty big but, and these kinds of pants normally squish it and its uncomfortable, these let my butt be ""free"" i guess you would say?",36882,2
36883,A little frustrated with this top.,36883,2
36883,First I will mention the positives; it is lightweight and fits pretty true to size.,36883,2
36883,"The colors pictured did not match the color I received, the color scheme was the same but the colors were darker, not a complete deal breaker.",36883,2
36883,"The problem is that one side of the top is more pointed and hangs down farther then the other side, it is not even and looks a bit strange on.",36883,2
36883,But my biggest problem is that the dye ruined a pair of white pants.,36883,2
36883,"I had it on with white pants and got caught in the rain, it bleed all over the areas of my pants that it came into contact with, still trying to salvage my pants.",36883,2
36883,"Finally, it is pretty thin and not that well made overall.",36883,2
36883,I do not recommend buying this top for the price paid.,36883,2
36884,"Nice shirt, great color but is cheap made and it doesn't fit like the picture.",36884,2
36884,It is  some how short and wide in the front.,36884,2
36884,Wouldn't recommend,36884,2
36885,Not what I expected,36885,2
36886,Quality seems good but color variety not good.,36886,2
36886,"Received too many red mittens, no black mittens which is what I was looking for.",36886,2
36887,"No zipper in the back so it's a tug n war to get over your head,in the description it says zipper on the back",36887,2
36888,"The cardigan draped very strangely around my neck, and my body isn't wide enough to fill out the cardigan.",36888,2
36889,Runs small,36889,2
36890,I like the pendant but the chain looks cheap and I'm gonna put it on a different one.,36890,2
36890,"The links also are to far apart,the pendant can fall off.",36890,2
36891,I hate giving bad reviews but I have to say that this dress was not good.,36891,2
36891,I ordered it a couple of sizes up because a lot of the reviews suggested it.,36891,2
36891,It took a long time to get to me but it did arrive a couple days before it was expected so I cant complain there.,36891,2
36891,The real problem was the dress itself.,36891,2
36891,I did order up a couple sizes but instead of enlarging the whole dress the shoulder strap area stayed really small and the rest of the dress got bigger.,36891,2
36891,"I had my sister a size 9 try it on and while it fit in the shoulders just fine the rest of the dress looked like a bag.... Again, I am sorry for the bad review but this is my honest opinion of this product.",36891,2
36892,The sizing chart was incorrect,36892,2
36893,"The fabric is very nice and as described, but the way it is sewn puts several layers of pleated and gathered fabric right at your waist line.",36893,2
36893,It made me look 10 pounds heavier than I am.,36893,2
36893,I will not wear it.,36893,2
36894,Not a good quality.,36894,2
36894,Didn't even match the design on the site.,36894,2
36895,I've had two pairs of these.,36895,2
36895,The smaller ones worked very well for us.,36895,2
36895,When baby outgrew them I bought a larger pair.,36895,2
36895,"The larger pair cut my baby several times, rather than preventing cuts.",36895,2
36895,The first time I thought it was my fault for not securing the velcro properly.,36895,2
36895,"However, it continued to happen even though I was diligent about securing the velcro properly.",36895,2
36895,"My baby woke up this morning, gloves secured, with a 1.5 inch cut on face from the sharp corners of the velcro strap.",36895,2
36896,Pretty but not AT ALL the size it appears to be in the picture.,36896,2
36896,Wish I would have read the reviews before buying.,36896,2
36897,The shirt is made of very cheap material.,36897,2
36897,You can't blame for the price.,36897,2
36897,But when it said it's chiffon.,36897,2
36897,I thought it would be nice.,36897,2
36897,It is very cheap polyester.,36897,2
36897,"Based on the reviews, I ordered large, which is kind of big for me.",36897,2
36897,"I am 135 lbs, 5.1.",36897,2
36897,I am usually small in US size.,36897,2
36898,Pretty light and flimsy.,36898,2
36898,Not what I expected,36898,2
36899,Was not true to size,36899,2
36900,Within 3 weeks these looked awful and were breaking down.,36900,2
36900,Very disappointed in the quality.,36900,2
36900,I guess you get what you pay for.,36900,2
36901,Neck size way to big.,36901,2
36902,Ordered these for my daughters birthday party but only received 2 instead of 2 dozen.,36902,2
36902,Amazon gave me a refund but we won't have them for her party.,36902,2
36902,I am extremely disappointed.,36902,2
36902,The quality of the hat itself isn't bad.,36902,2
36902,What I would expect for 50 cent a piece.,36902,2
36903,Dress is adorable but go much bigger than you need.,36903,2
36903,Very small.,36903,2
36904,"So...when I ordered this item, they sent me the shirt but the WuTang logo was upside down.",36904,2
36904,"I was thankful to get a message from customer service stating that they would send out a new one immediately, at no additional cost to me.",36904,2
36904,"However, the second one that has arrived is totally different from the first one.",36904,2
36904,"The second shirt does have the logo correct, however the material is totally different, and it is greatly oversized.",36904,2
36904,The first shirt is 57% cotton/ 5% spandex / 38% polyester.,36904,2
36904,The second shirt is 100% cotton and very stiff.,36904,2
36904,"Even the label on the shirts is different, indicating different manufacturers.",36904,2
36904,My wife pointed out that the first one appears to be a woman's tank top (based on how the back of it is shaped) and the second one (larger one) is a men's tank top.,36904,2
36904,I guess you never know what you're going to get if you order one of these.,36904,2
36904,"Customer service is great, and willing to replace the defective items, but at this point, I'm not sure what I want...I live the material of the first one, but it's a woman's style tank....if they can give me the men's version in this material, I'd be happy.",36904,2
36905,"The top is not as long as it appears on picture at all, no way I can wear this top",36905,2
36906,Didn't fit as expected.,36906,2
36906,Not happy that I have to pay for postage to return.,36906,2
36907,Disappointed!,36907,2
36907,I was so excited to see that my purse had arrived however when opening the box the shoulder strap is way too short.,36907,2
36907,It's advertised as a Cross-body but it is not.,36907,2
36907,"I looked at the video review and it was stated that the strap was 47 1/2"".",36907,2
36907,"My handbag shoulder strap is only 43"".",36907,2
36907,This is not a cross-body but a shoulder bag.,36907,2
36907,My model is 5.4 and weigh 162lb.,36907,2
36907,"and you can see how it fits up under the arm, not below the waist.",36907,2
36907,It's going back... loving the style but it does not meet the quality of what I'm looking for a true Cross-body hand bag.,36907,2
36907,not happy.,36907,2
36908,VERY thin!,36908,2
36909,I received a used jacket!!!!,36909,2
36909,"This was obviously returned, as the bag was torn and taped together, and the jacket looks as if it has been washed.",36909,2
36909,The buttons are stained/dirty.,36909,2
36909,"The mesh fabric back is yellowed, and does not match the white of the jacket.",36909,2
36909,I am including a photo.,36909,2
36909,"This is the second time I received a used chef coat, both times from the same shipper.",36909,2
36909,"They claim Amazon packs the items, so I'm not sure where the problem is.",36909,2
36909,"The jacket is a good Medium, not over-sized, and the fabric is very nice (not stiff).",36909,2
36909,"However, I am returning this used item and will try to re-order.",36909,2
36910,it was a child bowtie,36910,2
36911,"Darn, I really like the print of these pants and wanted to love them.",36911,2
36911,They don't look like they were designed for an adult-size child like so many others.,36911,2
36911,But I'm very disappointed in the quality of the flannel.,36911,2
36911,It's thin and the weave is coarse so they feel flimsy.,36911,2
36911,The cloth is only brushed on the outside so it's not soft on the inside next to your skin.,36911,2
36911,"In the large size they are also quite long, even after washing and drying, but rolling or sewing a cuff is not a big deal.",36911,2
36911,"If the cloth was better quality I'd be coming back for more, but sadly I won't buy again nor would I recommend them to others.",36911,2
36911,Too bad.,36911,2
36912,This is super wide & sheer...,36912,2
36913,"It was ok, a little cheap looking and arrived broken.",36913,2
36914,Normally buy small; I bought a medium in these.,36914,2
36914,"They're fine around the waist, but I didn't like how the pouch cramps its contents.",36914,2
36914,I cut out the pouch.,36914,2
36914,"After reading other reviews, I don't know whether I got a pair with a pouch that was smaller than usual or whether I just wanted or needed more room than others.",36914,2
36915,"This is not high waisted like it looks in the pictures and I'm 5,3 it was like 4 inches below my belly button",36915,2
36916,It is broken after a few hours my daughter wore it.,36916,2
36916,They are nice.,36916,2
36916,I bought two(2).,36916,2
36916,Now I scare to wear the other.,36916,2
36917,Good quality but they run about two sizes too small.,36917,2
36917,I was so disappointed.,36917,2
36918,Not true to size at all ifyou are size 10 and up don't bother unless your waist is 28in or less,36918,2
36919,Not too impressed with the look and quality,36919,2
36920,The item pictured here is not what I received.,36920,2
36920,I received a large messenger bag that looks similar.,36920,2
36920,"On closer inspection, the page I bought this from pictures this bag and the larger messenger bag but only describes the smaller bag.",36920,2
36920,"Having said all that, the giant messenger bag is nice looking and very sturdy.",36920,2
36921,The material felt cheap,36921,2
36922,The dress came within 12 days of ordering (expressed) but my top was made too short around the back so now I have 14 days before a wedding to try to get it altered to fit!,36922,2
36923,Ring started to turn black at the bottom.,36923,2
36924,fits small,36924,2
36925,Sizing is completely inaccurate...size you order is definitely NOT the size that arrives.,36925,2
36925,Not true to size...way too small.,36925,2
36926,It tarnished immediately.,36926,2
36926,And turned my finger green.,36926,2
36927,Cheap looking and very small....,36927,2
36928,Looks great in the picture...but the material is too thin and the off the shoulder area is awkward.,36928,2
36928,The stitches are too  visible.,36928,2
36929,"waste of my money,,,,very cheaply made, horrible material.",36929,2
36930,Too small!!!,36930,2
36930,Doesn't stretch at all !,36930,2
36931,Product size runs very small and lace was poorly stitched over the long sleeved t-shirt,36931,2
36932,wasn't crazy about how the back fit.... it covered too much lol It's great if that's what you're looking for.,36932,2
36932,I like the brazilian look better myself.,36932,2
36933,fast shipping but way way way to small..,36933,2
36933,I got a 3x and it's fits like a Large,36933,2
36934,if size was correct yeah,36934,2
36935,Small will fit my girlfriend but not me.,36935,2
36936,Cute but It cuts into your wrist too much.,36936,2
36937,the fabric is thin and cheap,36937,2
36938,Cute style but hard to keep on my feet.,36938,2
36938,Back keeps slipping down even at the tightest hole.,36938,2
36939,I purchased this backpack for my 11 year old daughter for school.,36939,2
36939,Its absolutely adorable and she loved it.,36939,2
36939,"However,  the zipper broke within the first 2 days of school.",36939,2
36939,She hadn't put more than a few folders and 1 binder in it so it wasn't overloaded.,36939,2
36939,I susally only need to buy 1 backpack per year so that was a real bummer.,36939,2
36940,Cheap cheap cheap.,36940,2
36941,I will agree with the other reviewers.,36941,2
36941,This dress smells like chemicals and I washed it twice before wearing it.,36941,2
36941,Oh and it's not a dress.,36941,2
36941,It's a shirt.,36941,2
36941,I only gave it two stars because it's cute and I got some compliments.,36941,2
36942,It's beautiful.,36942,2
36942,"However, even after compensating by ordering a larger size, I should have ordered it two sizes larger.",36942,2
36943,These pants are extremely see through.,36943,2
36944,Fit was weird.,36944,2
36944,Might look if you have a bust like the model.,36944,2
36944,Had to return,36944,2
36945,Good price but not a quality product.,36945,2
36945,Sizing was really small.,36945,2
36945,Would send back if it wasn't so hard to mail overseas.,36945,2
36946,Cheap quality and not what I expected :(,36946,2
36947,The medium was definitely way too small.,36947,2
36947,It's smaller than my small sized shirts.,36947,2
36947,It's also made out of a stretchy/shiny spandexy material.,36947,2
36948,I usually wear a size large.,36948,2
36948,I van usually wear One Size fits all..but these were just not the same.,36948,2
36948,The fabric is very thin.,36948,2
36948,The waist part doesn't had any added elastic or reinforcement.,36948,2
36948,I had to keep pulling them up even just walking.,36948,2
36948,I do have large thighs.,36948,2
36948,So I can't really blame these leggings for being a little snug on the thighs.,36948,2
36948,But just a warning to any other bigger thigh/hipped customers.,36948,2
36948,"These don't reinforce or ""hold in"" anything.",36948,2
36948,I wish these were a thicker material with a stronger waistline.,36948,2
36948,Maybe after I lose a few pounds these will work.,36948,2
36948,But you get what you pay for.,36948,2
36948,The green splatter design is very pretty though.,36948,2
36948,They look just like the picture.,36948,2
36948,I think these would be nice for anyone who wears s size small and possibly for those in medium.,36948,2
36948,But large or x-large probably not so much.,36948,2
36949,Was black and silver but says it's black and white when you order it.,36949,2
36949,Package it comes in even says black and silver.,36949,2
36949,Now I have to purchase a new dress as I was expecting black and white,36949,2
36950,Fell apart rather quickly,36950,2
36951,It is bulky and the design not so nice.,36951,2
36951,"Material comfortable but needs brushing all the time, every speck of dust or hair becomes attached to it.",36951,2
36952,"This product didn't fit as expected, but it depends on your body shape.",36952,2
36953,"The quality is good, but it looks like the manufacturer is trying to save a few pennies by making it as small as possible and still somewhat fit most people.",36953,2
36953,"If your head is even slightly large, don't buy it.",36953,2
36954,"Not a good fit for a person with a big chest, wide shoulders and small waist, too tight in the arms, makes you feel constricted  and irritable, not a good size for a person over 6ft 3 or 6 ft 4, color is beautiful but I do not recommend it for athletic built guys.",36954,2
36954,Quality fabric wonderful coat but not for the reasons stated above.,36954,2
36955,"I love the different pendants, but as other people have said it is almost impossible to get the charms off the chain to switch them, the rings are too small.",36955,2
36955,That is a poor design for a necklace that is supposed to be interchangeable.,36955,2
36955,I might just go buy a different chain.,36955,2
36955,I should have read the other reviews first!,36955,2
36956,These are fun tk wear but broke after dropping them once from 3.5 feet.,36956,2
36957,Very long wait for shipping to be delivered.,36957,2
36957,"Item was way smaller than anticipated, it didn't come close to fitting.",36957,2
36957,Unfortunately not a recommended product,36957,2
36958,"I bought a medium after reading the reviews (I am 5'1', and 110lbs, I usually wear a small) and although it fit just OK, the cut is awful.",36958,2
36958,It's very unflattering and poorly made!,36958,2
36958,I tried to return this product but it didn't end up being worth it since the cost of shipping is the same as the bathing suit.,36958,2
36959,"Haven't worn it yet, since it is too small.",36959,2
36960,NOT as pictured.,36960,2
36960,very disappointed in the colors we received,36960,2
36961,doesn't clip well onto my prescription glasses.,36961,2
36961,can't use it at all.,36961,2
36962,The lenses are not very dark and therefore completely see through,36962,2
36963,Returned it.,36963,2
36964,Not even on the sides.,36964,2
36964,And I guess it's made for people without breast.,36964,2
36965,"These are super short.....I am only 5'7"" and I could not pull them all the way up.",36965,2
36966,"I received these suits for me and a friend they were super cute, but there is no way an XL is an XL in the USA.",36966,2
36966,it was more like a medium if you're lucky!,36966,2
36966,Though I was very pleased with the seller who refunded my money promptly and without issue.,36966,2
36966,"The suit itself is beyond adorable and the fabric is very quality, just no where near true to the size stated.",36966,2
36967,"This is a very nice looking shoe but Amazon had it was titled as a ""running shoe"".",36967,2
36967,"once received, all labels clearly show that it is a basketball shoe.",36967,2
36967,Not what My son wanted.,36967,2
36968,I really wanted to love this dress.,36968,2
36968,It seemed like it would have been perfect for a summer wedding i am standing up in.,36968,2
36968,Unfortunately the bustier was uncomfortable and does not fit well over my bust.,36968,2
36968,I also find it to be unflattering for those with bigger hips.,36968,2
36968,"Unfortunately I didn't realize I had to return within 30 days, so now I'm stuck with a dress thay I cannot wear.",36968,2
36969,These are quality workout pants.,36969,2
36969,Nice fabric & fit.,36969,2
36969,I like that you can fold down the front panel for extra support.,36969,2
36969,The back cross panel seems like a good idea but felt strange on.,36969,2
36969,I am returning because wow are these see-through!,36969,2
36969,"I read from many other reviewers that they are not, however I wonder how bright the light was in the room they bent over in!",36969,2
36969,"; ) As a frequent squatter, deadlifter & lunger, these will never work...",36969,2
36969,Unless I'm cool with everyone seeing my bum (which I'm not)!,36969,2
36969,I'm glad there are free returns!,36969,2
36969,I'll stick to my lululemons and size up while pregnant.,36969,2
36970,"This ran very small, and the fabric was thin and clingy.",36970,2
36971,My son likes the sunglasses and they were a good fit.,36971,2
36971,The lens popped out almost right away.,36971,2
36971,"It popped back in, but come on.",36971,2
36972,Tiny size.,36972,2
36972,No way they would fit!,36972,2
36973,Too large ordered a size s with l tag and it was way to large about a m size,36973,2
36974,"So they're tights, and yes, I did buy a second pair of them, but only because after a few hours of wear, I got quite a few snags in them.",36974,2
36974,"I bought the second pair because I have one more event to wear them at, and luckily it's only a few hours as well, but I don't expect them to last either.",36974,2
36975,Breaks very easy.,36975,2
36975,Generic brands.,36975,2
36976,Stones were out of beads when it arrived,36976,2
36977,Nnnn,36977,2
36978,Unfortunately it fits too small.,36978,2
36978,I ordered a XL.,36978,2
36978,Thinking that it may be a size too small but unfortunately its like 3 sizes too small.,36978,2
36979,"Color was red, not maroon, fabric was thin.",36979,2
36979,ensure you size up considerably.,36979,2
36979,"I""m normally a M/L, I ordered XXL- it fit.",36979,2
36980,"Even with the strap as tight as it can go, it's still too big for my wrist",36980,2
36981,Tighter than expected.,36981,2
36981,"When buying, buy this at least one size up from your usual size.",36981,2
36981,Very spandex-like in quality.,36981,2
36982,looks too fake,36982,2
36983,Be careful because the lettering falls off very quickly.,36983,2
36983,This year is actually ruin now I washed it inside out and didn't put it in the dryer and the letter still fell off,36983,2
36984,Cute print,36984,2
36985,Thank you,36985,2
36986,I gave it a 2 star because it was way too short in the torso area.,36986,2
36986,If I pull it up to my under bust its too short on my stomach and vise versa.,36986,2
36986,I am 5'7 and about 160lbs.,36986,2
36986,I gave it to my sister and she loved it.,36986,2
36986,She very small (Size 2) maybe she just has a shorter torso.,36986,2
36987,It's a nice shirt and very warm but is WAY too small.,36987,2
36988,I wear mediums in most all leggings but these were way too tight in the waist and were uncomfortable.,36988,2
36988,They fit perfect in the legs but I had to return because of the small waist.,36988,2
36989,So hard to go by the size chart because in doing so the garment ended up quite a bit baggier than expected.,36989,2
36989,"I'd advise to go a size up at most, definitely not two sizes.",36989,2
36989,The fabric is super thin too.,36989,2
36989,I'm donating this shirt.,36989,2
36989,You get what you pay for I guess.,36989,2
36990,The costume is very thin and does not hold heat.,36990,2
36990,You freeze.,36990,2
36991,"Fluffier than expected, lower quality than expected.",36991,2
36991,"Hard to wear in a classy way, too princess-y.",36991,2
36992,I am 2 months pregnant and well endowed to begin with at a 34 DDD.,36992,2
36992,If I had read the comments about the top of the dress I would not have purchased this.,36992,2
36992,I loved the material.,36992,2
36992,I loved the fit and thought it was flattering.,36992,2
36992,I was super excited to add this to my summer pregnancy wardrobe.,36992,2
36992,Unfortunately the less than 5 inches that makes up the front of the black top left me inappropriately spilling out with no room for the girls to grow and that was on the XL.,36992,2
36992,It looked silly and no longer had a flattering fit when I pull the bottom up to get proper coverage.,36992,2
36992,Had to return.,36992,2
36992,Hope that they fix the top and add more material soon!,36992,2
36993,Ok but product showed up and its not totally white.,36993,2
36993,The lace over top offwhite and i needed complete white for family reunion pictures on beach.,36993,2
36993,"Also there is no way a girl 5'9 , 140lbs with long torso can where this in public without booty showing lol.i even ordered a size 10 This should say junior size or petite because short girls can wear this, not tall  .",36993,2
36993,I will be sending back.,36993,2
36993,Otherwise cute if you're short.,36993,2
36993,"And shows regular or strapless bra, need to get those tape on cups  for this one.",36993,2
36994,I so wanted to love these aqua socks!,36994,2
36994,They fit great and I felt good having something to protect my feet at the local indoor recreation center's pool.,36994,2
36994,"Today, I wore them for the second time and had a hole in the left foot by the ball of my foot.",36994,2
36994,There was a second hole forming in the same spot on the right foot.,36994,2
36994,Very disappointed ....,36994,2
36995,Very very poor quality.,36995,2
36995,Super thin material.,36995,2
36995,Arrived already torn with a giant hole.,36995,2
36995,Why bother shipping?,36995,2
36996,I do not get the cod piece addition to these stupid tights.,36996,2
36996,They added an extra 'pouch' for your junk and it looks ridiculous.,36996,2
36996,I would never use these in the gym or elsewhere.,36996,2
36996,I'd suggest that they get rid of the cod piece pouch since it makes you look like a fool wearing them.,36996,2
36997,Honestly this is more for bathing suit cover up .. Can't wear it out its super see through although very pretty the fabric is thin and light (mine even came with a little rip in the back) the sizes are funny too I'm 5'7 weigh 130pounds and I ordered a large ..,36997,2
36997,There was too much extra fabric ..,36997,2
36997,Medium would have fit well but still can't wear it to my party :P so it's going back,36997,2
36998,Does not work well.,36998,2
36998,Disappointed with the product.,36998,2
36998,Will be returning.,36998,2
36999,Cloth was very thin.,36999,2
36999,Can be used as inner layer.,36999,2
37000,"Did stay positioned,oddly irregular,",37000,2
37001,I was thrilled to order these tights!,37001,2
37001,When I got them the weather turned warm again and I couldn't wear them right away.,37001,2
37001,But I decided to wear them today (Nov. 1)  and they just are not great.,37001,2
37001,I wanted to love them.,37001,2
37001,"I'm 5'3"" and they are to short for me.",37001,2
37001,I ordered the 1xl/2 size they don't stay in place.,37001,2
37001,It took entirely to long to get them on and they slide down because they aren't long enough.,37001,2
37001,If they were they would be absolutely perfect!,37001,2
37001,They are nice and warm but they are such a hassle to get them pulled up and to stay up.,37001,2
37001,There is no way anyone taller than I am could get into these things.,37001,2
37002,Too small,37002,2
37003,too small in the shoulders!,37003,2
37004,It was advertised as being BLACK but it's WHITE/SILVER on (barely visible) black leather.,37004,2
37004,Fine for a costume party!,37004,2
37005,I bought this for a friend and it fell apart within 2 times wearing it.,37005,2
37005,It is very pretty but I would not purchase another one.,37005,2
37005,It is cheaply made.,37005,2
37005,Very disappointed.,37005,2
37006,Nice shirt BUT sizing is wrong.,37006,2
37006,As suggested I ordered a size OVER what I wear and it still fits tighter that my normal shirts.,37006,2
37006,I have to give it away to someone else disappointed.,37006,2
37007,"The jacket I received did not come with a hood, even though the picture shows a hood as does the description claim it comes with a hood.",37007,2
37007,I also found the buckle to be too loose fitting.,37007,2
37007,Otherwise the jacket looks nice enough but I am returning as I need a hooded jacket with a proper fit and unfortunately this one did not fill the bill.,37007,2
37008,Cheaper than I expected but I really can't for the price complain.,37008,2
37009,It's ok. Hard plastic not soft.,37009,2
37010,Too small in the shoulders,37010,2
37011,Fabric seems ok but way too small,37011,2
37012,"This was not the ""giant swing full circle skirt"" I expected.",37012,2
37012,"The picture seems deceiving, like it could be about 10 yards of fabric, which is what I consider to be a circle skirt.",37012,2
37012,This wasn't even close to that.,37012,2
37012,It was also very snug.,37012,2
37012,"I can use it, but not for what I intended or wanted it for.",37012,2
37013,i bought this for my fiance who breaks these shades often.,37013,2
37013,she loves them and loves the polarized.,37013,2
37013,"She finally broke them and so I bought her another, but they were a completely different pair.",37013,2
37013,Different design and not even polarized,37013,2
37014,IF YOU DONT HAVE A BIG BOOTY ALREADY ORDER A SIZE DOWN MINE WAS TO BIG THE BOOTY PART AROUND THE LEGS  KEPT GOING OVER MY BUTT HAD TO KEEP PULLING T DON AND RE ORDERED A SMALLER SIZE,37014,2
37015,Cool shirt but not what I thought it would be,37015,2
37016,I bought these as my first pair of clipless shoes.,37016,2
37016,"After researching the different types of pedal systems, I verified the pedals and cleats included with these shoes are the older ""Look Delta"" pedal type(not Look Keo), the shoes can be used with 3 or 2 hole cleats.",37016,2
37016,The item title can be misleading if you're not informed.,37016,2
37016,A previous reviewer said these were Look Keo replicas but Keo cleats will not work with these Look Delta pedals.,37016,2
37016,"In point, I would have preferred these were SPD SL pedals & cleats.",37016,2
37016,People have criticized the cleats wear out fast.,37016,2
37016,I'm still making adjustments to minimize the effort to unclip probably due to a high degree of float.,37016,2
37016,Sizing was bigger than expected; I normally wear a size 10.5 in Nike running shoes.,37016,2
37016,I ordered a 45 that turned out to be too big.,37016,2
37016,The free Return process was extremely easy and hassle free.,37016,2
37016,I then ordered a size 44 which fit a lot better but could have probably gone with a 43.5.,37016,2
37016,Instead of going through another return process I replaced the insole with a Dr. Scholls insole I already had for my running shoes.,37016,2
37016,Shoes now fit snug.,37016,2
37016,Will probably add a star if extended usage proves shoes and cleats are durable.,37016,2
37017,Bought this for my nephew which he picked out and gave me the size according to the size chart.,37017,2
37017,Way to small so sent it back.,37017,2
37018,Looks nice.,37018,2
37018,Doesn't last.,37018,2
37018,Poor quality.,37018,2
37019,"smaller than expected,",37019,2
37020,was too small on top and short at length not as pictured.,37020,2
37020,"I""m 5 feet and only hit me at waist.",37020,2
37020,Kind of flimsy.,37020,2
37020,I Liked the color and design.,37020,2
37021,The chain had some discoloration.,37021,2
37021,It was also very thin as described.,37021,2
37021,I would not be able to hold many pendants.,37021,2
37021,but would be perfect for a free hanging or something very lite.,37021,2
37022,"We bought the size we should have bought, but they were way too small and the top band felt almost dangerously tight.",37022,2
37022,"Otherwise ""cute"".",37022,2
37023,I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail only to be very disappointed when I received it.,37023,2
37023,It was way to small.,37023,2
37023,I would recommend ordering two sizes bigger.,37023,2
37023,Love the style and material.,37023,2
37024,"Great fit, but the fabric is rough and scratchy, even after several cycles of washing/drying.",37024,2
37025,"Super cute...yet super small...
Did not come true to size...
Just hanging in closet until I drop a few lbs... :/",37025,2
37026,The bunny ears will stab you think twice before ordering.,37026,2
37026,I love the design but maybe not so good for the area I guess.,37026,2
37027,Said xxl but was more like a medium-gave it to my sister,37027,2
37028,Is too large...,37028,2
37029,The tights barely reached my waist and I bought a size up.,37029,2
37029,Kept riding down as I walked.,37029,2
37029,Not cool.,37029,2
37030,This dress was not as shown.,37030,2
37030,Cheaply made and the color wasn't as bright.,37030,2
37031,"I received this and gave it to my girlfriend as a gift, but the day after it started chipping, the color was coming off like it was paint, and it stained her finger a dark color.",37031,2
37031,I was really upset.,37031,2
37032,The lining tears very easy; with in one wash it had started to rip and 3 washes later it was a mess.,37032,2
37032,It's not an expensive top so I just dealt with but cutting off the rips and hand washing.,37032,2
37032,"Color is a very bright color, the coral is a neon color for sure.",37032,2
37033,"terrible quality, broken when recieved and they make you send them back and reorder them",37033,2
37034,"I bought this for my 12 year old, initially she loved it and swore she was never going to take it off, but after only 1 day of wearing(we hadn't washed it yet) the inner arm area started getting little fuzzy balls (pilling?)",37034,2
37034,"The quality is really cheap and after we washed it, it started to come apart along the seams across the bottom and along the zipper.",37034,2
37034,She only wore it twice before we had to toss it.,37034,2
37035,"I love the glasses, but the plastic frame has an awful smell, and after wearing them for about 30 mins, the smell makes me nauseous.",37035,2
37036,This isn't leather at all.,37036,2
37036,If I wanted plastic I could go to the big box store down the street.,37036,2
37036,It's not what I'm looking for.,37036,2
37037,Cute but on the small size.,37037,2
37037,I feel you want something to stand out skip this one.,37037,2
37037,This is more for a child  having a dance recital not really for an adult.,37037,2
37038,"The fit is very small and the skull is glued on and there is not enough glue, it sticks up and will probably fall off.",37038,2
37039,"I'm waiting for my white sweater, but it is gray and very different than the woven picture",37039,2
37040,The top was way too large even with the straps tightened all the way.,37040,2
37040,The straps were also very loose - IE - I think even if you tightened them they would loosen of their own accord.,37040,2
37040,It is also very low cut - much lower than in the photo.,37040,2
37040,"The bottoms fit well, but the black strips on them appeared to have faded - like maybe you had worn them a few times and left them in the sun.",37040,2
37040,They did not feel as good a quality as the fabric the top was made from.,37040,2
37040,I was very excited about this swimsuit so was quite disappointed and have returned it.,37040,2
37041,Not the quality I expected.,37041,2
37041,I'm not sure if fake or not.,37041,2
37041,I've never had havainas before but before this pair I  owned a Payless plastic flip flop that lasted more than 6 years.,37041,2
37041,Someone borrowed and never returned them so I tried Payless again but they don't have them anymore.,37041,2
37041,I started looking on amazon and came across this flip flops.,37041,2
37041,The soles are fine but the strap between my toe cuts my skin.,37041,2
37041,I'm keeping them in hopes that they'll get better with everyday wear.,37041,2
37042,Ordered an extra large recieved a large size which was too small.,37042,2
37043,Very cheaply made.,37043,2
37043,Poor quality.,37043,2
37043,Broke the first time I wore it.,37043,2
37044,The product fit as expected for my 6 foot frame and would have looked cute with a black pair of leggings but I was disappointed with the cut of the fabric.,37044,2
37044,The fabric design did not match in the front and the back when put together making the shirt look poorly made.,37044,2
37044,I returned the shirt for a full refund.,37044,2
37045,Buyer Beware!,37045,2
37045,I got these glasses thinking the lenses would be a lot shorter.,37045,2
37045,"In reality, the lenses are 1.5"" tall and 1 7/8"" wide.",37045,2
37045,They look like they have a much lower profile in the photo.,37045,2
37045,"In addition, the plastic above the nose bridge and on the crown (on the edges where the arms swing out is a lot bigger (about 1/4 inch taller) than the photo depicts.",37045,2
37045,"Lastly, the brown ones have a ""spotted leopard"" pattern on them that no man should be caught wearing.",37045,2
37045,Too bad they left all of thos out of the product description.,37045,2
37045,I'll be returning mine.,37045,2
37046,It broke within like the first week- waste of my money.,37046,2
37047,Watch was running when it arrived.,37047,2
37047,Battery died shortly,37047,2
37048,"After reading the reviews, I really wanted this top: a turtleneck that was loose almost like a cowl.",37048,2
37048,I also ordered the size that I could determine from the size chart and the other reviewers.,37048,2
37048,"I am SO bummed: this top is unflattering and too tight, although the turtleneck was cowl-like and comfortable.",37048,2
37048,"I wear a size 18 right now (added weight the last few years, sigh), and I ordered an XXL.",37048,2
37048,I am so disappointed in this top.,37048,2
37048,"However, seeing what I looked like in this top (like a size too small!",37048,2
37048,"), I am motivated to get some of this weight off so I can go shopping in my own closet.",37048,2
37048,"Therefore, I am keeping this top, because I DO love the cowl-like turtleneck, and the material is soft and a bit thin, but not see-through.",37048,2
37048,"If you are a size 12 or 14, you could wear this top in the XXL.",37048,2
37048,"If you are a curvy woman like me, you can wear this top.",37048,2
37048,"If you are an apple-body, with your weight in the middle, this might not be very flattering on you, unless you got a larger size than you would normally.",37048,2
37049,NOT 70/30 cotton/poly.,37049,2
37049,It's actually 95/5 rayon/polyurethane.,37049,2
37049,"It's light and clingy, so works in hot weather, just wish it was actually cotton.",37049,2
37050,I ordered two sizes up based on the other reviews and the dress is still too short.,37050,2
37050,I could never wear this without leggings which is disappointing.,37050,2
37050,It's super cute but way too short.,37050,2
37050,"I'm 5'4"" 120 lbs and I ordered a large.",37050,2
37051,I wish I could have ordered this with different top and bottom sizes.,37051,2
37051,I ordered a medium but received a large.,37051,2
37051,"The ""large"" bottom fit like a small and the large top was definitely large.",37051,2
37052,Ordered a size Large and was disappointed with actual fit.,37052,2
37052,"This bikini is cute, but runs VERY small.",37052,2
37052,The large was more like a XXS.,37052,2
37052,"I realize the seller mentioned this, and I took a gamble.",37052,2
37052,I ended up giving it away to a friend.,37052,2
37053,"The lei is lovely, but not very durable.",37053,2
37053,"I got it for part of a derby-themed Halloween costume, and the band snapped about 30 minutes into wearing it after being snagged.",37053,2
37053,Because the flowers are strung together loosely they flew everywhere.,37053,2
37054,"I ordered 1 pair of pants with the inseam smaller then I would usually get, just because I needed it ASAP for a camping trip.",37054,2
37054,"Even though it was a tad small I loved it, because it was EXACTLY  like the pair of 5.11 brand tac-lite pro pants I own, for less then half the price.",37054,2
37054,"I decided to buy another pair in the right size, only to be let down.",37054,2
37054,The next pair I received was very diffrent.,37054,2
37054,The stitching seemed cheaper but more importantly the pockets are significantly smaller.,37054,2
37054,I'm an electrician and I rely on every single one of my pockets.,37054,2
37054,The velcro pocket on the left leg for example.,37054,2
37054,"I usually stick a small flash light in tire with a pencil, pen, an marker or 2.",37054,2
37054,"But the second  pair I received, I couldn't even fit a marker in there!",37054,2
37054,I'd say take a shot..,37054,2
37054,"But, if the key loop on your pants is a metal square (instead of a semi circle like in the picture) then return them.",37054,2
37055,Somewhat awkward fit.,37055,2
37055,The crotch on these seems to be too long while they legs are normal length.,37055,2
37055,Would not repurchase,37055,2
37056,"I wear medium 5'2"" 140Lbs but this medium was big and a got a small and it was perfect",37056,2
37057,It's gorgeous but definitely way too small.,37057,2
37057,I'm a size 6 and ordered a large and it's too tight.,37057,2
37058,"this swim suit looks the exact same in the picture
i am 5'8 dd bra size i usually wear between small and medium
i was unsure which size to get because from reading the comments most said true to size so i ended up getting a medium.the medium felt like a small and since im tall the straps couldn't even make it to my shoulders =[ it sucks because this swim suit is perfect but i guess its good for  girls that are short",37058,2
37059,Cheap fabric.,37059,2
37059,"May return, but does not look like the pictures",37059,2
37060,bottoms don't have good elastic,37060,2
37061,nice looking and well made.,37061,2
37061,ran small.,37061,2
37062,"Too loose in leg, very little elasticity",37062,2
37063,Not happy with straps.,37063,2
37063,They are turning inward and not fitting properly.,37063,2
37063,I've owned over a dozen of these and never has a pair with such flimsy straps.,37063,2
37064,I loved the earrings but the drop one has broken off the top part already,37064,2
37065,Seems like a.nice coat but way smaller than all my other XLs especially in the shoulders and arms.,37065,2
37066,"Not what i was expecting, poor quality..",37066,2
37067,I really like this dress.,37067,2
37067,But it shrunk after just one wash.,37067,2
37068,Bust was a bit too tight I'll likely be returning this,37068,2
37069,Dress had a lot of strings hanging off of dress and it runs small!,37069,2
37069,!,37069,2
37070,Awesome design but it is a skirt on me even though it is a xl the size of all my other shirts,37070,2
37071,The top is too small,37071,2
37072,It's exactly like the picture.,37072,2
37072,"It fits funny, it's uncomfortable and it has a really short torso, my daughter is petite and it's to small on her in the torso but is huge in the shoulder part",37072,2
37073,Cheap quality and VERY small,37073,2
37074,"top was very small, pants fit great.",37074,2
37074,I returned because of top,37074,2
37075,Good sunglasses but don't fit over everyday glasses well.,37075,2
37076,I really love the shoes but they already have broke on me.,37076,2
37076,Having them for a little over a month and wearing them sporadically does not give me confidence they would last.,37076,2
37077,I had to update this review.,37077,2
37077,My husband was highly allergic to this ring.,37077,2
37077,"His finger is raw, bloody, and pretty much ripped to shreds from being so itchy.",37077,2
37077,If your husband is allergic to nickel do NOT get this ring.,37077,2
37077,We didn't know he would react this way.,37077,2
37077,"On a positive note, seems high-quality and is super heavy and sturdy.",37077,2
37078,I'm surprised how foolish the picture is because I might as well have gone out naked because the fabric was so cheap it was almost completely transparent!,37078,2
37078,I tried wearing a bandeau with it but it completely showed the color and every single line through the fabric.,37078,2
37078,"I bought it and I haven't worn it once, I never got around to returning it though which makes me disappointed, but I will admit the fit was just as I expected it to bee and I was extremely upset when I put it on because it was very comfortable and fit in all the right spots, but it was just to see through.",37078,2

37081,Like comically large.,37081,2

37081,"The size does lend itself to good sun protection, but not much else.",37081,2
37081,I wore it for a couple hours on the ranch and after banging it into doorframes and everything else under the sun (literally) I said forget it and took it off.,37081,2
37081,"Also, the patch is stitched on crooked.",37081,2
37081,"Had I not already worn it and sweated in it, I would've returned it for a refund, but it is what it is.",37081,2
37082,Totally too small.,37082,2

37087,"I knotted it, figuring we could replace it when we got home, and hooked the clasp around the knot.",37087,2
37087,"Before another hour had passed, as we were walking down a street, she realized her pendant was gone.",37087,2
37087,We searched back a few blocks and couldn't find it.,37087,2
37087,"The pendant is pretty good, but if you're going to buy this necklace, get a new chain for it.",37087,2
37088,low quality,37088,2
37089,The chest area was oddly shaped.,37089,2

37096,"I did not know what cotton blend meant, it is like a swimsuit material.",37096,2
37096,I was wanting this as a possible swimsuit cover so for me that was ok.,37096,2
37096,If you are wanting a nicer dress to wear out I would not recommend this dress.,37096,2

37126,"These were SO cute and have such great lenses that I wanted to leave a five star raving review.... until three days later the plastic part of the frame cracked and broke off in THREE different places, as if the hard plastic center had already been broken and just a film gloss held it together.",37126,2

37130,I wish I could return it but it is not worth the shipping charge.,37130,2
37130,It does slim you but it digs in and hurts after 30 mins so I do recommend wearing it over something.,37130,2

37146,I don't have very wide hips so I can't imagine how this works on a lot of girls.,37146,2
37146,Since I needed it for an ugly sweater party and I love the design of this so much that I overlooked the shotty craftsmanship.,37146,2

37187,This wallet is however acceptable.,37187,2
37187,It is made of a non-ferrous (non-magnetic) metal.,37187,2
37187,"This product is painted black, a coating which I've found scuffs easily if you drop the item on the ground and step on it if you [the owner] are blundering idiot.",37187,2
37187,This item has a plastic insert which allows cards to be carried and kept separately.,37187,2
37187,The plastic insert folds out in an accordion-like way.,37187,2
37187,"This product is labeled BRYK on the outside, perhaps a misspelling of 'brick' to infer that perhaps the wallet is heavy or red or made of rocks- all of which are false presumptions.",37187,2
37187,"In fact, the wallet is very lightweight and off-black and made of a non-ferrous metal.",37187,2
37187,I endorse the purchase of this product to others if it is what you're in the market for.,37187,2
37187,This review meets your expectations sufficient to decide whether you do or do not want to purchase this wallet.,37187,2
37187,Edit: This product has not held up well over time.,37187,2
37187,"I still use it, but the inner divider has fallen apart and been removed and the latch has broken.",37187,2
37187,Basically it flops open and spills my cards everywhere when dropped now.,37187,2
37188,When ordering I was excited to get a thick knitted top.,37188,2
37188,"After I received it, the quality was nothing close to what the picture looked like!",37188,2
37188,"It was a thin cotton, so thin it was almost see-through.",37188,2
37188,I was not pleased with it at all!,37188,2
37189,I didn't think this coat would arrive before my last winter trip but it did.,37189,2
37189,It arrived faster than I was quoted.,37189,2
37189,I had opted to cancel it the day before it arrived because I found a Slate & Stone fitted coat at Burlington Coat Factory for $50.,37189,2
37189,This coat is really big in the waist and has an awful plastic smell.,37189,2
37189,I think I'm going to keep it.,37189,2
37189,Dry Clean and have it altered in the waist.,37189,2
37189,"It's a coat I would keep by the door to run out and pick up my UPS boxes, grocery shopping and taking the kids to school because is warm and lightweight.",37189,2
37189,Fashion wise...I wouldn't wear it to impress.,37189,2
37190,said 34waist but more like 33 for sure,37190,2
37191,"too small, very short in torso.",37191,2
37192,Too small to use.,37192,2
37192,The flap doesn't snap close after filling the slots with the cards.,37192,2
37192,I returned the item.,37192,2
37193,I really liked the style as pictured.,37193,2
37193,"Unfortunately,  I didn't take into account that I needed extra space for a larger chest.",37193,2
37193,"So, the bow was right below my chest, making the shirt ride up.",37193,2
37193,"Overall, not a good fit for my body type.",37193,2
37194,Make sure you order larger.,37194,2
37195,They were to small and too short,37195,2
37196,Belt is poor quality leather and tears at buckle,37196,2
37197,not what I expected,37197,2
37198,"Cute concept but sized really small and material too thick to be comfortable, doesn't stretch enough",37198,2
37199,Too large for a newborn,37199,2
37200,doesnt fit like says,37200,2
37201,it fit weird so I had to return it,37201,2
37202,Looks cheap.,37202,2
37203,String started to pull the first time I ever wore them.,37203,2
37203,I bought 3 other colors and they did not do this.,37203,2
37204,I got the double layer [studded] pearl charm choker.,37204,2
37204,"It's fairly good looking, but the quality is awful.",37204,2
37204,"The clasps that are used to hold the two leather laces together come apart easily and are poor quality, and the chain broke after only a few times of wearing it.",37204,2
37205,WAY TOO SMALL!,37205,2
37205,I got an XL and I'm usually and L so I thought I would play it safe!,37205,2
37205,IT WAS A NO GO!!!,37205,2
37205,I had to regift to my friend who is a SMALL!!!,37205,2
37205,And it fit her perfectly!,37205,2
37205,Just sad because it is such a cute shirt,37205,2
37206,This was one size to small,37206,2
37207,;(,37207,2
37208,Not a genuine leather.,37208,2
37208,Doesn't pay to ship back.,37208,2
37208,Feels like a sand paper on the inside.,37208,2
37208,Otherwise cheap so I guess its ok for what i paid for for,37208,2
37209,"Nice color and overall shape, but I would call it a medium.",37209,2
37210,Too Small.,37210,2
37211,Not really fantastic.,37211,2
37212,don't like,37212,2
37213,Looks good but seams are splitting after a week.,37213,2
37214,Not length,37214,2
37215,The sizing chart is WAY wrong.,37215,2
37215,This top was just MASSIVE and I returned it promptly.,37215,2
37215,I ordered a medium from the sizing chart and it fit me like an extra large.,37215,2
37215,I would suggest buying 2 sizes smaller.,37215,2
37216,This is super cute I got a medium which is my regular size..going to try a large bc I could barely button it.,37216,2
37216,I am very petite and this was even tight on my arms.,37216,2
37216,I weigh 117 pounds I'm 5'3 and I'm a 36 B.,37216,2
37216,If I could get an xl I would.,37216,2
37217,This is not what I ordered!,37217,2
37217,The picture shows a thicker knitted sweater and I got  a thin jersey knit type material.,37217,2
37217,Completely disappointed in that as that is what I really wanted!!,37217,2
37217,But it is cute and I will still wear it!,37217,2
37218,"The quality of material is very cheaply made, therefore it ends up looking nothing like model.",37218,2
37218,I will never wear it.,37218,2
37218,Wasted my money,37218,2
37219,Top was too small bottoms were good fit.,37219,2
37219,Returning because needed a complete suit.,37219,2
37220,Not enough space for my cards.,37220,2
37220,It also broke pretty fast because I tried to fit and extra card in there.,37220,2
37220,I just feel like it isn't realistic for today plastic money world.,37220,2
37221,Size was not accurate.,37221,2
37222,"Had recently tried on multiple styles of dresses, and size was too small.",37222,2
37222,"Ordered size up was better, but still little on snug side where not usually a hard too fit spot under breast.",37222,2
37222,"Definitely sending back smaller of 2, maybe both.",37222,2
37223,"First, I did not get compensated to review this item.",37223,2
37223,It's not obvious but these have a Velcro closing.,37223,2
37223,"They are made very small, so they were not true to size.............at least not American sizes.",37223,2
37223,I think they would probably fit several sizes below the size I ordered.,37223,2
37223,"I'm sending them back, but is anyone else not seeing a potential problem with Velcro closed swimming gear???",37223,2
37223,?,37223,2
37224,"I ordered a size M, I usually wear S. It was too big.",37224,2
37224,But the skirt is nice.,37224,2
37225,"The cups are larger than expected, and there is so much material it is very bulky and the small clip in the center of the bra is a cheap plastic.",37225,2
37225,I dislike everything about it.,37225,2
37225,Want to return but waiting for response whether I can return.,37225,2
37225,I recommend against this purchase.,37225,2
37225,"You can purchase nice, cheap bra's at Walmart which are much nicer.",37225,2
37226,"Nice look and feel, but way too small for a size small.",37226,2
37227,You get what you paid for.,37227,2
37227,It's very cheap.,37227,2
37228,The appliqu&eacute; is cut but more as a diaper cover does not work well as panties,37228,2
37229,"Quality of material is awful, it has already started to fall apart and has only been worn once.",37229,2
37229,I do not recommend,37229,2
37230,"Nothing wrong with shirt, just didn't fit my body",37230,2
37231,The top was way too small for the size ordered.,37231,2
37231,Didn't care for the style at all (of the top).,37231,2
37232,Looks like cheap costume jewelry - which I guess it is based on the price.,37232,2
37232,"To quote my wife ""Very Gaudy"".",37232,2
37233,Too small,37233,2
37234,"Flip flops aren't always comfortable, so I wasn't surprised that the toe ""thong"" hurt my son's feet after a while, but the BIG disappointment was that after one day, the back strap elastic is all stretched out and curly, and no longer holds to his heel!",37234,2
37234,"Otherwise, they are cute and thick and well made, but the strap elastic is garbage!",37234,2
37235,ehhh,37235,2
37236,"Too bulky, I returned them.",37236,2
37237,"I ordered the ""pew, pew"" deadpool shirt and the coloring is very dark, not bright red but close to black.",37237,2
37237,Hey that's what we get for ordering from China.,37237,2
37238,"After several wears, the bottom portion started to roll up.",37238,2
37238,"I had to wear a thin t-shirt or something under it because the longer I wore it, it irritated and scared my skin on my back.",37238,2
37239,Material is okay.,37239,2
37239,The size is what I am most upset about.,37239,2
37239,It is like a Men's medium.,37239,2
37239,I'm not sure if it was worth the $40 I paid for it because I gave it to my little brother.,37239,2
37239,The size chart is misleading and inaccurate.,37239,2
37239,"The XL says 42"" waist so I ordered 2XL because I wanted to wear nice dress clothes underneath.",37239,2
37239,"I have a 40"" waist and the 2XL was WAY to small.",37239,2
37239,I am throughly disappointed...,37239,2
37240,I'm a size D in the chest and the army green dress in XL fit more like long shirt.,37240,2
37240,Not loose at all except a Lil loose in the chest area.,37240,2
37240,Definitely not like the picture.,37240,2
37240,But I'll fold it under and wear it with some shorts for a cute shirt instead.,37240,2
37241,Very pretty!,37241,2
37241,Item was just as described but it tangles a quite a bit when wearing.,37241,2
37242,The material was very flimsy causing it not to fit well.,37242,2
37242,I'm 150lbs and a medium was too big,37242,2
37243,"The socks are good fabric, the colors are richer than the ad photo -- but they are not wide calf, and they are not knee height (I'm between 5'7"" and 5'8"" tall, and my legs are in proportion).",37243,2
37243,"I don't have a 19"" calf, more like 17"", and these socks don't come close to fitting.",37243,2
37243,They are also short.,37243,2
37243,"I like them well enough to wash them to make them shrink even more, and them wear them as mid-calf trouser socks.",37243,2
37243,"But I wanted knee socks that were real socks, not haevy nylon knee=length, and these don't make it.",37243,2
37244,Too small through the shoulders and just right through the body and hips.,37244,2
37244,"Too bad I will have to return it, because the style and fabric were just what I wanted.",37244,2
37245,A little smaller than expected.,37245,2
37246,Nothing like what I expected......,37246,2
37247,Doesn't have that under skirt like the picture but I'm still planning to use it.,37247,2
37248,The idea is different and cool & the quality is alright.,37248,2
37248,The big killer for me was the unevenness.,37248,2
37248,I just couldn't stand how uneven they were.,37248,2
37248,"Hopefully they fix this because they are nice sunglasses, but not worth it if they stay uneven like such",37248,2
37249,It's not compressed at all.,37249,2
37249,Too loose like normal tank top.,37249,2
37250,"I ordered these in black, but they were white when they arrived.",37250,2
37250,"They are still really cute, so I'm going to keep them and reorder.",37250,2
37250,Hopefully I'll get the ones I want next time.,37250,2
37251,Very thin.,37251,2
37251,Chain broke as soon as I took it out the package and stood in front of the mirror with NOTHING inside of it.,37251,2
37252,It's ok.,37252,2
37253,Quality is not that great.,37253,2
37253,Good for a couple of times.,37253,2
37254,Too small can't wear,37254,2
37255,The overall craftsmanship of the wallet is great.,37255,2
37255,It is very functional...but... Don't count on this blocking RFID..,37255,2
37255,I have tested this a few times with a few different RFID cards and readers.,37255,2
37255,The wallet has not blocked the RFID signal once.,37255,2
37255,"I am disappointed, but I got it during a Prime lightning deal so at least it was on sale.",37255,2
37255,Just wanted to let people know that they might not be protected like they think they are.,37255,2
37255,"Also, I can't speak for all of their wallets... only the one I received.",37255,2
37255,So some might work and the one I received could just be the victim of a quality control problem.,37255,2
37256,"I would pass on this shirt, because it's super thin and doesn't fit right.",37256,2
37256,"I got a small, which in Chinese sizing normally fits me to a T, but this one was HUGE.",37256,2
37256,"I'm a 32B in bras, so if you're similar I would pass on this shirt.",37256,2
37256,"If you're normally a medium, I'd opt for the small and get it in black, so it's not see-through!",37256,2
37257,One of the first items I've ever had to return.,37257,2
37257,"Disappointed, that these are not described correctly, very short and the sizing seems small too me.",37257,2
37257,Amazon was great with the return...I just printed the label and mailed it back.,37257,2
37258,"Large didn't fit me usually wear medium , material looks nothing like the pictures",37258,2
37259,Looks and fits great.,37259,2
37259,Don't expect to open more than one-two bottles.,37259,2
37259,Was a fun gag while it lasted.,37259,2
37260,I ordered and Xl (I'm a D cup and a medium bottom).,37260,2
37260,I couldn't even get the top or bottom on.,37260,2
37260,"I'm 5'9"" and 133 lbs.",37260,2
37260,I returned them.,37260,2
37260,Too bad because the pattern is really cute.,37260,2
37261,the neck si simply too tight,37261,2
37262,"I bought 3 pairs of these jeggings - the colors are great, but as others have warned, they don't stretch.",37262,2
37262,The sizes are not consistent either.,37262,2
37262,"One pair I could wear if I didn't plan on sitting down, but they were too short in the crotch, no matter how much I pulled them up.",37262,2
37262,"I'm 5'4"", 115 - not heavy, not a stick.",37262,2
37262,"I really wanted them to work, but sadly, I returned them.",37262,2
37263,cracked after wearing 3 times.,37263,2
37263,I had to glue them together.,37263,2
37263,they are light and they float.,37263,2
37264,These plugs are very long.,37264,2
37264,i.e.,37264,2
37264,they stick out the back of my lobes much too far to wear.,37264,2
37265,The band is too short.,37265,2
37266,The sweatshirt I got looks nothing like the picture on the site.,37266,2
37266,"Also,I ordered a medium and it's a good thing I am a tiny woman.",37266,2
37266,"Cute, but order at least 2 sizes up from what you think you should wear",37266,2
37267,I gave away.,37267,2
37267,I don't exactly have the figure for clingy fabric.,37267,2
37268,"The design looks great, but I am returning it due to lack of quality for the price point.",37268,2
37269,The minute I tried it on it ripped on the zipper and all I did was pull it up pass my bottom.,37269,2
37269,"I wasn't even rough either, this material is very thin.",37269,2
37269,If you get this product be veryyyyy careful.,37269,2
37270,"the chain look is deceiving, once you have it in your hands it is toooooooo thin.",37270,2
37271,"I loved this dress, expect for the bodice was too small and the skirt was see through.",37271,2
37271,I could squeeze into it by almost busting the zipper but it was not worth the struggle.,37271,2
37271,"I first tried it on with blue panties on and was immediately like no, then even with white panties on you can still see through it.",37271,2
37271,I could wear a slip under it but that would defeat the purpose and be an unnecessary step and expense.,37271,2
37271,"For the record I ordered a small, and I'm 5'2, 120 pounds and 34a.",37271,2
37271,"The skirt consists of 2 layers, one sheer white, and another sheer white with black polka dots, why they made both layers sheer is beyond me.",37271,2
37271,I paid full price for this item and then sent it back.,37271,2
37271,"I am returning this, and am thankful for Amazon free returns on select clothing.",37271,2
37272,"i bought extra large.i wear small on maidenform,so now the panty part is too big for me because i have small butt and the legs part is too loose.i just follow the sizing since i'm 36 on hips i get the xl..maybe if i have big thighs it will do..it doesn't really control, it just smoothen the bumps.i should have gotten the L then maybe it's 4 stars.",37272,2
37273,I don't know why there was a zipper for one of the pockets.,37273,2
37273,It wasn't particularly convenient for quick access and the cord kept getting caught in the Velcro.,37273,2
37274,Very costume and cheap,37274,2
37275,Cheaply made.,37275,2
37276,I should have bought up a size.,37276,2
37276,"Bottoms fit, but when held up into the light they would become see through.",37276,2
37277,The fit was fine but the colors are nothing like what is pictured.,37277,2
37277,They were very faded and all the colors weren't there.,37277,2
37277,The seller did refund my money so I gave him 2 stars,37277,2
37278,The leather feels very cheap and it appears that there is sometype of paper between the layers of material.,37278,2
37278,Would not buy again,37278,2
37279,This dress is like underclothing and the material unraveled easily.,37279,2
37279,"It can be worn to a party at night, so the flaws won't be noticed.",37279,2
37280,Looks nothing like the picture.,37280,2
37281,I recently purchased what I thought was ONE charm with the 2 cats the picture looked great on line.,37281,2
37281,Upon arrival I had received 5 low quality cat beads?,37281,2
37281,"?......Also the amount of time this item took to arrive on my doorstep was way too long, the friends birthday I had ordered this for had come and gone..so I ended up purchasing another gift for her.",37281,2
37281,Would not recommend this item.,37281,2
37281,Very disappointed.,37281,2
37282,"Hard plastic, uncomfortable.",37282,2
37282,Lens popped out of frame during shipping.,37282,2
37282,Returned,37282,2
37283,Turns your skin green.,37283,2
37284,Pants are too low in the waist and too short in back.,37284,2
37284,The legs fit snug for the size.,37284,2
37284,Top fits and feels great.,37284,2
37285,These were not as shown.,37285,2
37285,The logo was missing from the cuff.,37285,2
37285,Makes me think they were knock-offs or seconds.,37285,2
37285,Shipped in a bag direct from China.,37285,2
37285,Middle finger was not touch sensitive.,37285,2
37286,Fits perfect.,37286,2
37286,"I am 5""9' 165lbs in slim & muscular shape.",37286,2
37286,The lining is super warm cause it's made of White Duck Down Feathers.,37286,2
37286,The quality is overall well stitched and the buttons are on point.,37286,2
37286,It's a dull matt finish which I kind of prefer than having something shinny.,37286,2
37286,"Now for the Cons:
It's not tapered in.",37286,2
37286,Jacket is wider than expected.,37286,2
37286,The length is also not as long as expected.,37286,2
37286,The zipper is on the left which leaves me to believe this is a women's jacket but I don't know the standards in china.,37286,2
37286,It's made in China.,37286,2
37286,Though surprisingly pretty well for china.,37286,2
37286,I bought a MEDIUM which I received but that translates to an XXL.,37286,2
37286,Is this made for Oompa Loompas?,37286,2
37286,And here's the worst part.,37286,2
37286,FAKE POCKETS!,37286,2
37286,Do not buy and support companies that make fake pockets.,37286,2
37286,We're men.,37286,2
37286,We need our pockets.,37286,2
37286,The one interior pocket is real.,37286,2
37286,But the two outside pockets are completely fake.,37286,2
37286,That's false advertising.,37286,2
37286,This jacket has great potential but it simply falls flat in too many areas.,37286,2
37286,The picture looks better than the product.,37286,2
37286,If you don't trust me then be my guest and waste your money.,37286,2
37287,Ring started to turn black at the bottom.,37287,2
37288,Completely different from photo horrible material,37288,2
37289,Terrible material and faded fast.,37289,2
37289,Couldn't even use it for a month,37289,2
37290,These sizes are small,37290,2
37291,terrible,37291,2
37292,Ordered a large and it fits like a medium so unable to wear this out guess I'll have to wear it as a swimsuit cover up,37292,2
37293,Peesy cheap pare of ear rings and necklace.,37293,2
37293,I'm pretty dos pointed even for the price.,37293,2
37293,"You can see glue marks, it looks like it's something you would but for play time.",37293,2
37293,Pretty sad.,37293,2
37293,I would not buy them unless you want a cheap piece of jewelry.,37293,2
37294,I love it but it's too small....,37294,2
37295,The image suggests contoured tailoring.,37295,2
37295,Fits more like a potato sack.,37295,2
37295,Could be great if you are shaped like a sack of potatoes but not so nice for some of smaller builds.,37295,2
37296,Material was soft but the fit was more like a man's muscle tank not flattering and very boxy like fit,37296,2
37297,Very small..only two of them fit my finger.,37297,2
37298,I am extremely disappointed.,37298,2
37298,Less than two months later I have 1 out of the 3 left.,37298,2
37298,One pair got a hole on the thigh.,37298,2
37298,Right now I noticed a rip along the seem on the back of my leg near my buttocks.,37298,2
37298,Maybe I didn't measure myself correctly.,37298,2
37298,I am relieve this product didn't cost more.,37298,2
37298,I might not buy this brand again.,37298,2
37299,Kinda small and tight....,37299,2
37300,Expected 100% cotton that I could wear to work.,37300,2
37300,"Instead, very tight fitting almost spandex like material that wouldn't all all be appropriate for the job.",37300,2
37300,Further no two shirts were the same secondary to multiple manufacturers.,37300,2
37300,Would be okay for leisure but I would have needed to go one size higher.,37300,2
37301,The earings are too big!,37301,2
37302,"the jacket is not terrible, but you get what you pay for.",37302,2
37302,"The jacket did not fit my wife, even though she went two sizes up.",37302,2
37302,"It actually fits my daughter, and she will be using it.",37302,2
37302,"The travel case that it came with had a bunch of loose threads trapped in the tie so it was difficult to open, and frayed.",37302,2
37303,Size was too small,37303,2
37304,Runs very small,37304,2
37305,"The top offers no support, If I lift my arms up my boobs will pop out below.",37305,2
37305,Quality of material seemed just ok.,37305,2
37305,Nothing special.,37305,2
37306,I ordered XXL 2-3 sizes bigger than my actual size.,37306,2
37306,"Still a bit amall, but can wear it opened comfortably, the lace has a stretch to it and the silk is smooth",37306,2
37307,My package did not contain the colors as shown.,37307,2
37307,"Instead were mostly hideous dark Pepto-Bismol pinks and shockingly bright lavenders, the ugliest colors you can imagine.",37307,2
37307,Lace pattern is stamped on and looks really cheap.,37307,2
37307,"Too costly to send them back, will donate to a women's shelter.",37307,2
37307,"Probably won't bring much joy to those women either, but it's better than throwing them out.",37307,2
37308,Bought these as flower girl shoes for my daughter.,37308,2
37308,"She wore them indoors at the wedding and reception and by the end of the event, there were scuffs and rips on both of the toes.",37308,2
37308,She's not excessively hard on her shoes normally so these must be cheaply made.,37308,2
37308,"The elastic strap across the foot was so tight, we had to cut it off completely halfway through the wedding.",37308,2
37308,"My daughter has narrow feet, too.",37308,2
37308,"They've now become slip on dress up play time shoes, and soon they'll be going in the trash.",37308,2
37309,Very poorly finished,37309,2
37310,"Beautiful necklace, but arrow is very tiny.",37310,2
37310,It would be great for a child.,37310,2
37311,The V on the bottoms are MUCH lower than on the pic.,37311,2
37312,Not very good quality but can complain wasn't very expensive.,37312,2
37313,"Its insanely long and large, either would be ok alone but together it looks ridiculous.",37313,2
37313,My only option is to try and hem it but the material will be tough.,37313,2
37313,Also no holds for the belt!!,37313,2
37313,Love the color and would be cute if you didn't look like a blow up decoration.,37313,2
37314,I was really excited when it arrived.,37314,2
37314,After trying it on their was a huge hole in the sweater right under the armpit area.,37314,2
37314,If it didn't have the hole it would have been a five star item.,37314,2
37314,I may have just gotten a defective item.,37314,2
37314,Otherwise without the hole I can invision it as a very sexy top I would have liked to have worn for my boyfriend.,37314,2
37315,My belt is missing from the costume,37315,2
37316,Totally lace and see thru up top.... and I didn't expect it from the photo.,37316,2
37316,I bought the dress for my daughter and she would have no part in the see thru upper.,37316,2
37317,"Magnetic did join right, long length was shorter, quality not as good as others purchased",37317,2
37318,This product was very cute but NOT a good fit for a larger bust.,37318,2
37318,I am a DD and there was not enough material at the top!,37318,2
37318,It is a lower quality material but for the price it was what was expected.,37318,2
37318,So for me it was 2 stars but for someone with a smaller bust size it would make a great addition.,37318,2
37319,Cute necklace...but it changed color after one wear.,37319,2
37320,I ordered these because my new cartilage piercing was bothering me because it poked me.,37320,2
37320,"I assumed the screw on backing would circumvent that issue, but I've had to put that on hold because it's a thicker bar than a normal earring.",37320,2
37320,I had trouble even getting it through the piercings I've had for over a decade because they are thicker.,37320,2
37320,I also only received 10 pcs when I ordered 12 pcs.,37320,2
37320,"I only needed them for one hole so it's not the end of the world, but these definitely were not what I was hoping for as I am unable to even switch out my new piercing with them until I go back to the piercer and get them redone at a higher gauge.",37320,2
37321,Too small,37321,2
37322,Cute!,37322,2
37323,Normally a 36/37 is pretty long on the arms  this shirt is too short,37323,2
37324,"It's a good hat if you have the right head size, sadly my head is too small for it.",37324,2
37324,I'm 5 feet and 8 inches tall and I have a normal head size for my height.,37324,2
37325,Beautiful dress.,37325,2
37325,But the zipper is a hassle and not true to size.,37325,2
37325,I tried to get it corset in the back and after emails back to back I was told to order it a different way that is not even offered on the actual page where the dress is and was told that I had to pay like $25 for shipping.,37325,2
37326,Very thin material.,37326,2
37326,Not flattering on a curvy mom to be.,37326,2
37326,Shows everything.,37326,2
37326,Will return.,37326,2
37327,"Nothing like the photo, too small and not as long as it appears in photo.",37327,2
37327,Wife didn't care for it.,37327,2
37328,These are not for men.,37328,2
37328,They are little boys!,37328,2
37329,the leather look of this purse actually looked like cheap plastic.,37329,2
37329,Did not like this at all.,37329,2
37330,"Don't like it... Too large, inferior material...",37330,2
37331,I had no idea the entire romper would be see through :( it is incredibly thin like lingerie... a bit disappointed.,37331,2
37331,I might have to use it as the other girl does - on top of my bathing suit.,37331,2
37332,Cheap fabric and a medium was more like an extra large.,37332,2
37332,Also extremely long.,37332,2
37332,Don't recommend buying this shirt.,37332,2
37333,Not crazy about this.,37333,2
37333,It was much shorter than this in the waist than it looks in the picture and the quality seems really cheap.,37333,2
37334,Material isn't spectacular quality and runs smaller than actual size,37334,2
37335,"Big and bulky, not at all what I expected",37335,2
37336,I should have trusted my instinct.,37336,2
37336,"I didn't like these first sight seeing on the website, but then seeing all the great reviews, picture of the pretty box as well as the high percentage of cotton (I like cotton socks), I decided to give them a try.",37336,2
37336,The socks I received were defected.,37336,2
37336,"I don't know what to call that part, the edge of the ankle part, the threads are coming out in at least two pair of the socks.",37336,2
37336,"Despite of the high cotton percentage, the fabric feels very ""raw"" and rough.",37336,2
37336,"Sure the package is pretty, but what's the point of that?",37336,2
37336,I'm looking for comfortable socks!,37336,2
37336,"I'm glad I ordered these socks at the same time.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flora-Fred-Women-s-3-Pair-Pack-Vintage-Style-Polka-Dot-Cotton-Crew-Socks/dp/B00T35506W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flora&Fred Women's 3 Pair Pack Vintage Style Polka Dot Cotton Crew Socks</a>&nbsp;Now at least I have some soft and comfortable socks to wear.",37336,2
37336,"Btw, these ones also come in a nice box, but they just don't advertise it as a selling point like Vero Monte.",37336,2
37337,Those sleeves are short and low quality.,37337,2
37337,Worth paying more for eclipse,37337,2
37338,"Most likely I just didn't read the specs carefully, but these earrings are HUGE and very heavy.",37338,2
37338,"I has trying to go for something a little more subtle, but they almost touch my shoulders.",37338,2
37338,There is only detail on the front so they look super strange from the back.,37338,2
37339,Did not fit at all... it was way to small all the way around,37339,2
37340,"Meh, not what I expected
The quality is not good",37340,2
37341,Sizing for your hat is difficult; large rain cover is too tight for the high side of large hats.,37341,2
37342,Not only small was late getting here,37342,2
37343,they broke within 2 hours of use,37343,2
37344,Cheap quality and they slip off my nose very easily.,37344,2
37344,They don't cover my eyes all the way which causes the sun to be in my eyes.,37344,2
37345,It doesn't look as nice as the picture.,37345,2
37345,You can open it to charge it in the light/sun but the glow doesn't last very long.,37345,2
37345,It has a kinda cheap feel to it.,37345,2
37345,It would be good for a little kid though.,37345,2
37345,I paid a little under $4 for it and for that price I wouldn't recommend buying it.,37345,2
37345,Maybe for $2.,37345,2
37346,Not true to the size,37346,2
37347,I thought these would be amazing since they're GloFX.,37347,2
37347,"The do look classy on, however they are dark like sunglasses so you can't see anything around you in an indoor edm show.",37347,2
37347,It's very disorienting.,37347,2
37347,And the diffraction isn't crisp.,37347,2
37347,It just smears the image together with color so you can't tell what you're looking at.,37347,2
37347,"Sure there are more rainbows, but you have to be at the front of the stage in super bright light for these to be fun at all.",37347,2
37347,I bought my friend a cheap pair of knockoffs that were really loved and passed around.,37347,2
37347,No one wanted to use these.,37347,2
37347,"I would be returning them and getting another cheap pair for myself, but someone made off with them at the very end of the night.",37347,2
37348,I ordered it because it was described as dark red.,37348,2
37348,I'm returning it because it's bright red.,37348,2
37348,"It doesn't match the shoes or print on the dress... in fact, it clashes.",37348,2
37348,"Otherwise, it's fine for the price.",37348,2
37349,No support.,37349,2
37349,The material is itchy and they kept falling off me so I had to constantly pull them up as they would slip down.,37349,2
37350,"I thought this would be really cute, had to reorder it down a size.",37350,2
37350,The corset part does not stay flat and keeps bunching up.,37350,2
37351,The gown is lovely.,37351,2
37351,There area few differences between the photos.,37351,2
37351,And the gown I received.,37351,2
37351,It's also shorter than expected,37351,2
37352,This dress was a huge disappointment.,37352,2
37352,I orders it to wear to a military ball with my husband and the material is to cheap to wear.,37352,2
37352,The peach color is more like a swimsuit than a formal dress.,37352,2
37352,The lace is itchy and many spots have more material on the edges than need be.,37352,2
37352,The dress did come quickly which is good cause I need to order a new one.,37352,2
37352,I am glad the company did ship to my APO address.,37352,2
37353,Lovely design but very weak product.,37353,2
37354,"Sooooo, I am 34-26-36, 5'9"".",37354,2
37354,I am an athletic built.,37354,2
37354,"The waist part was a bit large, the bottom part was a bit tight.",37354,2
37354,And I don't even have that much of a butt.,37354,2
37354,"The cup liners it comes with are literally these cut out cirles... You will have to change the liners, it makes it look very cheap or not very grade A .",37354,2
37354,Overall size dimensions are correct just not very propositional dimensions on body.,37354,2
37354,Forever 21 suit looks better on me than this,37354,2
37355,These run small,37355,2
37356,"I ordered White as stated but was sent BEIGE, that was not listed.",37356,2
37356,"I wear a 16w and the large fits like an extra large, it very loose.",37356,2
37356,If I can return for under $2.00 I will.,37356,2
37357,These are nice looking shades and the price was great but they broke after two weeks.,37357,2
37357,I would not buy again nor recommend.,37357,2
37357,Spend a few extra bucks to get something not so cheap.,37357,2
37358,Earring itself is pretty.,37358,2
37358,"It won't stay on my ear as a crawler, falls downward.",37358,2
37358,"The wire is squared at the top, I feel like it shouldn't be so wide.",37358,2
37359,"Didnt fit good and was not cute on...maybe it is just my body, but this bikini was a NO GO for me personally.",37359,2
37360,Too large for the size they mentioned on the shirt.,37360,2
37361,These glasses are cheap and flimsy.,37361,2
37361,Stamped out of thin aluminum-like metal.,37361,2
37361,"They work ok, but you get what you pay for.",37361,2
37361,Two stars because the price is low.,37361,2
37361,"For a few bucks more, get the Costco 3 pack.",37361,2
37362,At first they were gold.,37362,2
37362,But after a week of wearing these they turned copper colored.,37362,2
37362,"Also the ring that resembles an ""X"" broke.",37362,2
37362,I loved these rings but stopped wearing them because of the color.,37362,2
37363,I bought this to fit Apple Watch straps - none of them fit.,37363,2
37364,"They look cool, but the threaded part of the pistol stripped out the first time I tried put them in.",37364,2
37365,"Not just a bit small, but way too small for US sizing.",37365,2
37366,2 stones fell out within the first 2 weeks,37366,2
37367,Returned - too too too large,37367,2
37368,Small and very sheer.,37368,2
37368,This top is more for someone who is narrowly built and a junior size.,37368,2
37368,I think if I was a thin teen I would love it but top  is not for anyone older.,37368,2
37369,I ordered a medium because other people said it ran small and the top fits fine (maybe even a little loose) while the bottoms look like they're an extra small.,37369,2
37369,"The top looks okay, but it definitely looks like an $8 bathing suit.",37369,2
37369,The print makes it look cheap (it looks a lot better in the amazon photos).,37369,2
37370,It's a different type of material than I thought it would be,37370,2
37371,"Ordered a large, fits like an extra-small.",37371,2
37371,Shipped from China.,37371,2
37372,I always wear a 7 N but these seem too small and they don't have the next size up for me to try.,37372,2
37372,The only way I'm going to be able to see if I can use these is to practice in them for a little while but if they are too small then I'll get charged a restock fee for using them.,37372,2
37372,There are few to none narrow sizes for me to choose from which makes it hard to keep going in tap class.,37372,2
37372,I think I would like the shoes if I could get a good fit.,37372,2
37372,Certainly the buckle is easier than the traditional one.,37372,2
37373,The shape is weird.,37373,2
37373,It is narrow in the shoulders and is too full at the bottom.,37373,2
37374,I did not like these.,37374,2
37374,The material made a crinkling noise.,37374,2
37374,"It felt fine, but you could hear a crinkling noise whenever you touched the earmuffs and they did not fold like they were supposed to which I needed so I returned them.",37374,2
37374,I would have kept them if they had folded nicely even with the crinkly noise.,37374,2
37375,No name on the back as the original.,37375,2
37376,Runs way too small.,37376,2
37376,"I normally wear a XS, and this was way too small in the bust area.",37376,2
37376,The fabric feels like a cheap tablecloth.,37376,2
37376,Do not recommend it.,37376,2
37376,Also has a weird smell to it.,37376,2
37376,Very disappointed.,37376,2
37377,Runs small- I will not be able to wear it very long.,37377,2
37378,I only give it a two because my daughter loves how girlie it is.,37378,2
37378,Otherwise I would give it a one star.,37378,2
37378,We've only had the coat for 3 weeks and already I've had to sew back on 3 buttons.,37378,2
37378,I expect more to fall off throughout the winter.,37378,2
37378,"Also, the fur collar is attached via elastic and buttons.",37378,2
37378,"Again, poorly made.",37378,2
37378,Continually comes undone.,37378,2
37378,"And lastly, one of the seams on the collar fell apart and I had to stitch that back together as well.",37378,2
37378,"Overall, it's a good looking coat but falls apart quite easily and will require some basic knowledge of sewing to repair.",37378,2
37379,"Ordered a Medium, but was sent a large.",37379,2
37379,"Tried to reorder, but no longer a prime item.",37379,2
37379,A medium would have probably been too big as well.,37379,2
37380,"I'm not at all ""over weight"" but these leggings were Way to small in the thighs.",37380,2
37380,For anyone looking to get these I recommend a size or two bigger.,37380,2
37381,this dress looks more like a shirt and the material was very bad,37381,2
37382,"Thin, cheap fabric.",37382,2
37382,i immediately gave it away.,37382,2
37383,Wasn't what I thought I had ordered,37383,2
37384,It Is too small and different color,37384,2
37385,not near the quality I thought a small item though would be thicker cloth,37385,2
37386,Not at all what I expected...but it's okay.,37386,2
37387,Sorry.,37387,2
37387,I had to pull them up just under my bra and even then they were huge.,37387,2
37387,I am not a small woman.,37387,2
37387,I'm plus-size and was hoping that the bulk factor would actually be minimized since I am on the larger size of what would fit.,37387,2
37387,They are enormous.,37387,2
37387,Much wider than you'd think.,37387,2
37387,"Rather than fill the skirted portion, it just felt like a balloon around me.",37387,2
37387,"My thought was, what a cool skirt-like piece that I could wear with leggings underneath for warmth while teaching this winter.",37387,2
37387,"Maybe a black turtleneck and some groovy jewelry for a funky, bohemian prof look.",37387,2
37387,Nope.,37387,2
37387,Buy them MUCH smaller than what you think you need and maybe you have a chance of finding a better fit.,37387,2
37388,Cute design but broke 2 months after I bought it.,37388,2
37388,Also turned my skin green  Maybe I'm just allergic to the type of plating used.,37388,2
37389,It was two sizes too small.,37389,2
37389,Really disappointed,37389,2
37390,Super cute!,37390,2
37390,but very itchy,37390,2
37391,Not as pictured.,37391,2
37392,This is not very sturdy.,37392,2
37392,A piece already broke off after using it once.,37392,2
37393,Too big,37393,2
37394,Sturdy but lightweight.,37394,2
37394,The colors are beautiful.,37394,2
37394,"But, I started trying to stretch my ears and thought I was starting with a 14 gauge because that's what the picture says the kit starts with.",37394,2
37394,"But when I counted, it actually starts at a 12 gauge!",37394,2
37394,I couldn't even get the spiral a fourth of the way in before I started feeling my ear burn!,37394,2
37394,"I know it's not supposed to feel good but the pain was very bad, not normal discomfort that you would have stretching your ears.",37394,2
37394,"I stopped immediately and now I'm going to have to buy a whole new kit that actually starts at a 14 gauge like it says, maybe even one that starts at a 16 gauge just to be safe.",37394,2
37395,Came fast.,37395,2
37395,Colors are EXACTLY as pictured and very vibrant.,37395,2
37395,"Material is great, hats seem great for fall and winter.",37395,2
37395,They are not slouchy like in the sellers photos.,37395,2
37395,Look at the customer review photos for an accurate depiction.,37395,2
37395,I wish they were a little more slouchy but these will work as functional hats they just are not stylish,37395,2
37396,Not sure what figure it flatters.,37396,2
37396,The dress is huge on top with wide armholes; the bottom is true to size.,37396,2
37396,Nice fabric and tailoring.,37396,2
37396,Was sorry it didn't work out.,37396,2
37397,The dress isn't as flattering as it looks on the model.,37397,2
37397,It's actually large around the waist line.,37397,2
37397,"the belt does not help, it is weirdly puffy in the front if you tie the belt tight enough.",37397,2
37397,Kind of disappointed.,37397,2
37398,"The top part is falling down, almost like it was pressed down.",37398,2
37398,Won't stay up.,37398,2
37398,Doesn't look good on me.,37398,2
37398,I have much older/fatter arms than the model.,37398,2
37398,"I would recommend this to the young folks, maybe?",37398,2
37398,"Too late, for me...  50+",37398,2
37399,The fit was really weird,37399,2
37400,much larger then expected,37400,2
37401,"Initially looked great, over a period of weeks after purchase the black paint on the back and sides started peeling off.",37401,2
37401,Not a week after the A broke off leaving just the jem and a sharp stick that would poke my wife.,37401,2
37401,She has removed it and town it away.,37401,2
37401,She ware it 2x for a period not exceeding 4 weeks total.,37401,2
37402,If u order this u will have to order a bigger size im a large and order a med and it was too small,37402,2
37403,Dress runs small and short.,37403,2
37403,"I'm 5'5"" and it was short.",37403,2
37403,But very cute design.,37403,2
37404,Absolutely tiny.,37404,2
37404,Very sad because it would've been cute if 2 sizes bigger.,37404,2
37404,Well made though.,37404,2
37405,"No, it did not fit.",37405,2
37405,Bathing suit looked and felt fine.,37405,2
37406,Large fits like medium and even with the right fit it wouldn't fall in the front like the picture.,37406,2
37406,It's a pretty color just not the fit u would expect.,37406,2
37407,too short,37407,2
37408,Was way too wide oddly shaped ordered different style and loved that one,37408,2
37409,I wore this for 3 days after I had the baby and immediately the fabric would fold over in the back.,37409,2
37409,It was also too big to wear after the first week so now I have to buy another band to keep wearing.,37409,2
37409,It was definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it.,37409,2
37410,"Not the best material, the decal started to flake off right away after one wash",37410,2
37411,"It's very small, more like a cosmetics bag, not a handbag insert.",37411,2
37412,I won't call these running pants or even exercise pants.,37412,2
37412,The waist isn't made for any sort of physical activity as the internal elastic is simply too thin.,37412,2
37412,"They also aren't very well made, already coming apart after just a couple of months with minimal use.",37412,2
37412,I bought a pair of  TASC pants at the same time and would highly recommend those.,37412,2
37412,Much better pair of activewear pants.,37412,2
37413,looks cheap,37413,2
37414,"Nice belt, good price
Update: belt fell apart within a few months.",37414,2
37414,I would have been better off spending more money and buying better quality.,37414,2
37414,"Once again I was lured in by a great price, and disappointed by a poor quality item.",37414,2
37414,When will I ever learn?,37414,2
37415,about the pocket watches I bought sometime in sept.could not pass up that great price.,37415,2
37415,bought 3. one  for me and the others for gifts.,37415,2
37415,the guys that bought them before me was very lucky and I must be very unlucky every one had some kind of scratches +one had some kind  of slight deformity on the outside also.since I don't get out very often and have to use a walker I don't like going up to the post office to mail anything so I just kept them.,37415,2
37415,as long as I'm talking I might as well say something else about them they don't seem to be as large as the ones I remember my dad and uncles had.,37415,2
37415,when they would get together and show off by swinging  them around by the chains,37415,2
37416,Very very sheer.,37416,2
37416,"I mean, a white bra shows through perfectly.",37416,2
37416,I can't imagine what you could wear under this and still have it look as cute as it is.,37416,2
37417,Product not as pictured.,37417,2
37417,Shirt is nearly black making it hard to see writing.,37417,2
37418,"Meh, cheaply made.",37418,2
37418,I probably will not ever wear this.,37418,2
37419,Alli,37419,2
37420,These are a lot bigger than I expected.,37420,2
37420,They aren't too heavy but you can definitely tell the weight difference.,37420,2
37420,But they are extremely hard to unclasp and anytime you unclasp them to take them out it hurts really bad and pulls on your nipples,37420,2
37421,Bought these for my 6 year old boy with the assumption that they were red like the description says.,37421,2
37421,"However, they are more like a pink color.",37421,2
37421,Very disappointed!!,37421,2
37421,!,37421,2
37422,I love the top part of this backless halter top swimsuit.,37422,2
37422,"But for a 5'1"", it's not for petite size so it was too long for me.",37422,2
37423,I should have listened to another reviewer when they said this dress is a cheap knock-off of an IGIGI gown.,37423,2
37423,Very thin material - kind of like nightgown material.,37423,2
37423,"Unfortunately I can't send it back since it was on sale, but, live and learn.",37423,2
37424,"I was excited to get this dress, but unfortunately I was disappointed.",37424,2
37424,"The colors are nice and vivid, but I find the fabrics too thin and see through.",37424,2
37424,"Also, it must be cut for a much smaller body as not only is it too tight, the waist fits well above the natural waist.",37424,2
37424,"I am 5'7"", which I think it's more or less average height.",37424,2
37425,"Not even close to being like this picture- way too small- I bought an XL (I am usually between med/lg- 36c - 5'5""- 130 lbs)  maybe if u have a smaller bust might work?",37425,2
37425,Seems are way off in matching up the pattern so it looks stupid.,37425,2
37425,Waist is fit way too high.,37425,2
37425,Feels like it would be super comfy though.,37425,2
37426,Poor quality,37426,2
37427,The size and material not as shown ..,37427,2
37428,"cheap, cheap, cheap",37428,2
37429,They are great.,37429,2
37429,Unfortunately the hinge is a compliant plastic (wishbone) design.,37429,2
37429,And it cracked and broke - so now they are virtually useless.,37429,2
37429,As an engineer it appears there is aglow issue in the molding process and this is a design issue due the sharp corner.,37429,2
37429,"The seller will not allow return, nor do I have a means to contact them.",37429,2
37430,Cute shirt but extremely small,37430,2
37431,Way too small,37431,2
37432,Not what I was hoping for.,37432,2
37432,"It's a much bigger pendant than I expected, as some of the other reviewers have said.",37432,2
37432,It's about the diameter of a nickel.,37432,2
37432,"Also, the chain is a weird length.",37432,2
37432,"It hangs right in the middle of your chest, so it's neither elegant and long, nor short and flirty for lower necklines.",37432,2
37432,"Mine arrived with plenty of seeds inside, but one had already fallen apart by the time it arrived.",37432,2
37432,it seems way too fragile.,37432,2
37432,I will be returning this.,37432,2
37432,It looked like such a good idea!,37432,2
37433,Not a flattering cut.,37433,2
37433,But it seems well made.,37433,2
37434,Too big for wrist.,37434,2
37435,Looks cheap .,37435,2
37435,Nothing like photo,37435,2
37436,I'll wear it but it is a very cheaply made too,37436,2
37437,The sizes run super small... And the waist trainer isn't at long in length as excited extend.,37437,2
37438,Bad quality,37438,2
37439,extremely big.,37439,2
37440,very small,37440,2
37441,Ear do not stand up.,37441,2
37441,They lay flat ruining the illusion of antlers.,37441,2
37442,"This tank was the perfect fit, until I dried it.",37442,2
37442,It literally shrunk to a child size length.,37442,2
37442,I've never seen anything like it.,37442,2
37443,Love the design.,37443,2
37443,Always wear XL in these leggings but couldn't get these much past my knees.,37443,2
37443,Run very small!,37443,2
37444,too tight around bust.,37444,2
37445,It's only $11 but the handle broke already.,37445,2
37445,I just tied it differently and hopefully it will stay longer,37445,2
37446,Much shorter than pictured.,37446,2
37446,"I am 5'4"" and ordered the XL.",37446,2
37446,"It is plenty roomy, but about 5"" shorter than pictured, either the model is a dwarf or the jacket design is different than pictured.",37446,2
37447,"Cheap quality, it ripped right away in the back.",37447,2
37448,I wish I could return it for a medium.,37448,2
37449,The fabric of the blazer was extremely thin and rough.,37449,2
37449,The lining was a joke as it stopped above where a t-shirt would stop.,37449,2
37449,Mine arrived with strings hanging off of it and was very poorly-made.,37449,2
37449,I love how the description says it will keep you warm- do not be fooled!,37449,2
37449,"Again, the fabric is very very thin.",37449,2
37449,I purchased the bright yellow one for a Halloween Costume and it worked fine for that but I threw it away afterwards.,37449,2
37449,This product is worth maybe $5 or $10.,37449,2
37449,I cannot believe I paid $19 for this.,37449,2
37450,The coat is weirdly sized the arms are super baggy the pockets hang by a thread the coat is not form fitting what so ever and the hood is gigantic i literally have nothing positive to say about this its good to have in winter if you had no other option i guess very disappointed for $40 definitely returning,37450,2
37451,These run small.,37451,2
37451,May husband wears a 38x36 and he couldn't even button these.,37451,2
37452,Nice appearance but key holders not secure.,37452,2
37452,Would not buy again.,37452,2
37453,not true size,37453,2
37454,"the part where your foot goes fits fine but the heel of the shoe is awkward, it doesnt really reach all the way to the ground as if it's too short for the shoe.",37454,2
37454,also the smell of the shoes is so strong and unpleasant and it took almost a week to air them out.,37454,2
37454,the buckle on the strap was also very difficult to do and undue.,37454,2
37454,overall they look nice and they do technically fit but not really worth all the negative aspects.,37454,2
37455,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife based on the reviews however, when I opened the package I was disappointed.",37455,2
37455,The rose and snake are very big.,37455,2
37455,I was expecting something a bit smaller.,37455,2
37455,The chain appears to be very cheaply made and is not very long.,37455,2
37455,It wasn't made for an adult unless you wanted to wear it as a choker.,37455,2
37455,My wife says she likes it and wants to keep it but will need to get a new chain if she's going to wear it.,37455,2
37456,Very small fit,37456,2
37457,Fabric wise this was a great purchase - nice and stretchy if a little less give on the waist band.,37457,2
37457,The big upset was this particular print.,37457,2
37457,It makes you look like you might have had an accident.,37457,2
37457,"Sailor Moon's elbow, with the red bit of her glove, wrap under the crotch area and onto the rear making it so awkward (see back photos to get an idea then imagine it even worse).",37457,2
37457,"Every person I saw within the first 2 hours of wearing (thankfully all friends while I was home), very first thing, commented that it looked like I had a bowel movement.",37457,2
37458,It's comfortable but it's about 3 sizes too big.,37458,2
37458,I normally wear an extra large so I ordered a large because the description says runs big.,37458,2
37458,It should say how big!,37458,2
37458,I had to tie it in the front and the back to give it some shape.,37458,2
37458,The cut is square.,37458,2
37458,Looks NOTHING like the photo.,37458,2
37458,I should have tried it on before going on vacation.,37458,2
37458,#disappointed.,37458,2
37459,these earring were so small they would not fit my four year grand daughter.,37459,2
37459,"The picture showed a adult wearing them, but no way could a adult wear these!",37459,2
37460,Nice plants but they run small and shrink incredibly.,37460,2
37461,"Nicely built bag, heavy material.",37461,2
37461,"I don't use it because it has weird Chinese philosophy stuff, written in English, embossed on a piece of leather stitched to the front panel where you can't take it off.",37461,2
37461,Would be three stars for fit.,37461,2
37461,Would be four stars except the closers are small magnets that must be aimed carefully to ensure that your stuff stays secure.,37461,2
37461,Don't buy this or any of the same bags offered under different names.,37461,2
37462,To small I got the x-lg.,37462,2
37463,The adhesive it's not as secure as it should be.,37463,2
37464,Ok quality,37464,2
37465,I'm kinda displeased with my glasses.,37465,2
37465,"They actually broke but still hold they cracked by the nose and up around the eye, they won't last much longer.",37465,2
37466,"I had high hopes for this swimsuit, I am 5' and 105lbs and it was a little snug, which is fine, but the scalloped edge is too thin to stand up on it's own, so it just looked like little sad droopy flaps all along the edge of the suit.",37466,2
37466,They need to be stitched rather than just single layer flaps.,37466,2
37467,The chain is thicker than i expected:(,37467,2
37468,Was dying to get these however they were ridiculously too narrow.,37468,2
37468,The narrowness in the foot and the high back up the ankle made them impossible to even force into submission.,37468,2
37468,In the end I was the one crying.,37468,2
37469,Cute shirt very boxy.,37469,2
37469,No shadow to it looks like a piece of square fabric with lace on top.,37469,2
37470,I've worn this without taking it off for the two weeks since I've received it.,37470,2
37470,The plating on the part that attaches to the chain has completely worn off in that time.,37470,2
37470,The plating on the back of the pendant itself and 2/3 of the front plating is likewise gone.,37470,2
37470,I bought this to replace a similar piece I owned for several years until the chain broke and the pendant was lost.,37470,2
37470,That piece was made from a stainless steel washer.,37470,2
37470,I had hoped this one would be as durable.,37470,2
37470,"Sadly, it is nowhere near as durable.",37470,2
37470,I will continue to wear this so long as it doesn't cause skin discoloration or irritation but I would not purchase it again in the future.,37470,2
37471,Crown is misspelled  (cronw) and is super hard to open,37471,2
37472,The necklace was broken when it arrived,37472,2
37473,Doesn't look like pictire,37473,2
37474,it did not look like the picture,37474,2
37475,"So I have to say while I only rated this a 2 star it's only because they did not have it in stock, and the company sent me an alternate piece which I did not love.",37475,2
37475,I sent them an email and they were so amazing and cordial and had me pick from another piece in that price range and the necklace I got was phenomenal!!,37475,2
37475,See photo I've added- it's gorgeous!!!,37475,2
37475,...they also let me keep the necklace I didn't love as much.,37475,2
37475,"Shipping is from afar, but the prices and the jewellery make it worth the wait!",37475,2
37475,Will order again and again from this company!,37475,2
37475,!,37475,2
37476,Too too too huge and I have a big scared face LOL,37476,2
37477,"Na,  looks totally different.",37477,2
37478,Had to give it away,37478,2
37479,"The top of the dress is pretty much see-through, does no flair like the picture and mine came slightly ripped at the seam.",37479,2
37479,ORDER A SIZE UP!,37479,2
37479,You get what you pay for.,37479,2
37480,"I like the dress,but for the first time I wore to work the right side rip or torn all the way down, Leaving to see the lining.",37480,2
37480,Then the lef side close to the him on the side is also rip.,37480,2
37480,The dress is FIT expected and order extra large.,37480,2
37480,But for No apparent reason the dress rip off.,37480,2
37480,It doesn't have allowance on the side when sewed.,37480,2
37480,I fell embarrass as the whole Co-worker notice it.,37480,2
37480,I can't do anything about it since I'm already at the office.,37480,2
37481,This item is deceptive.,37481,2
37481,Be cautious and order two sizes up.,37481,2
37482,Fabric is OK.. to tight in all areas except the waist.,37482,2
37483,Looks nothing like what is pictured,37483,2
37484,"These socks were too tight, especially at the top, almost to the point of them being uncomfortable.",37484,2
37484,"My thighs measure 20 inches around and they hit me at about mid-thigh and since they were so tight I got a ""muffin top"" type of effect, not very attractive looking.",37484,2
37484,Another issue is that they would roll down the more I moved.,37484,2
37484,"Cute, but too small.",37484,2
37485,"Kind of cheap looking, but definitely not the worst I've seen.",37485,2
37485,"I'm 5.3 120 lbs and tend to find that ""smalls"" can end up either just righ, a little large or way too big for me (depending on company) - and this small was way too small, the last thing you want in a romper is for it to ride up and not lay right.",37485,2
37485,.,37485,2
37485,.,37485,2
37485,.,37485,2
37485,so I sent it back.,37485,2
37485,"For a smaller girl under 5.3, this could be cute!",37485,2
37485,"Or maybe on someone taller/thinner build, with long legs!",37485,2
37486,Cute lime pictures  but to small Gave it to my sister,37486,2
37487,Meh.,37487,2
37487,"It fits okay, but the fabric is flimsy.",37487,2
37487,"I'd recommend this as a costume skirt, as opposed to something for daily wear.",37487,2
37488,"Rides up in crotch area, and I have a short waist.",37488,2
37488,So size up 2 sizes!,37488,2
37489,Just wasn't what I expected nicely made but not as I pictured it ...Sorry!,37489,2
37490,The bikini came very wrinkled and the only reason I chose to return it was because it doesn't look like the shade in the picture.,37490,2
37490,The yellow was too neon for my preference.,37490,2
37490,On the other hand it's a good dupe and the fit was as expected I got an xs.,37490,2
37490,I'm 5'2 weigh 106 and 34a.,37490,2
37491,Cute purse.,37491,2
37491,Good quality but the extended strap is missing one clip that hooks onto the purse.,37491,2
37492,"My daughter loved it, but it broke the second time she wore it.",37492,2
37493,Size was too small.,37493,2
37493,I'll have to give this one away to a very small female.,37493,2
37493,"Fabric is a bit rough, too.",37493,2
37494,Bought this as a gift.,37494,2
37494,The recipient told me there was so fraying on the edge.,37494,2
37494,Will update as to how long it holds up.,37494,2
37495,Very thin clingy fabric.,37495,2
37495,Not for me.,37495,2
37496,This necklace/earring set was very low quality.,37496,2
37496,I didn't have high expectations given the price (I usually buy relatively low price/quality jewelry on eBay) but this was pretty bad even by my standards.,37496,2
37496,"The whole necklace was made of a cheap plastic--the ""metal"" chain feels about at strong as thick paper.",37496,2
37496,"When mine arrived, part of the plastic around the ""stone"" was broken off.",37496,2
37496,"Overall not worth the money, unless you're looking for a necklace similar to that out of a vending machine or the goody bag from a kindergartener's birthday party.",37496,2
37497,Meh it's ok,37497,2
37498,Pouch is too small and poorly designed.,37498,2
37498,"I had to add a ""snap"" to keep the pouch closed.",37498,2
37499,terrible fabric.,37499,2
37499,Came with dirt on it while it was in the plastic bag,37499,2

37501,"This is cute but so small it looks like a charm not a pendant, I was very disappointed .",37501,2
37502,Not so good!,37502,2
37503,Fits much smaller than expected!,37503,2
37503,"I usually take a medium or large, I ordered an Extra large and it's still way too small.",37503,2
37503,One of the straps broke after 1 wash (by hand).,37503,2
37503,Don't waste your money.,37503,2
37504,Way to cheap looking,37504,2
37505,Wore it a couple times and it broke.,37505,2
37505,Still a rather cute design.,37505,2
37506,Very cheap material - would not recommend it.,37506,2
37506,"Go for a higher end product, it's worth the money.",37506,2
37507,I really wanted to love these but they are see through on me,37507,2
37508,I ordered an XL because I wanted it to fit like the pic..too tight and short it fit like a med.. not happy,37508,2
37509,It is small,37509,2
37510,Fit fine but torso is too short,37510,2
37511,Cheap stretchy material.,37511,2
37511,I didn't like at all,37511,2
37512,"I am not rough with my purses, but this one started falling a part after less than a month.",37512,2
37513,These slippers are very hard to get on.,37513,2
37513,They are very flimsy and my son ends up walking on the back part that goes above the heel.,37513,2
37514,"super small, they run small",37514,2
37515,Removing and inserting cards is difficult.,37515,2
37515,"The elastic bands are way too tight to easily wrap around paper currency, i.e., a poor money clip.",37515,2
37516,"I have bought these pants at a retail store, and they fit well.",37516,2
37516,"However, these were too small.",37516,2
37517,Cute but came discolored..did not was well..,37517,2
37518,The material is like a swim suit.,37518,2
37518,"Also, very see through.",37518,2
37519,It was hard for me to believe that this was a plus-size shirt.,37519,2
37519,I normally wear an Extra Large sized shirt (size 14).,37519,2
37519,"I also wear a 38DD bra; but the chest wasn't the only issue, the arms were very tight and so was the back.",37519,2
37519,"I literally felt like if I sneezed, I would ""hulk-out"" turn green and rip the shirt into pieces.",37519,2
37520,is very very small,37520,2
37521,Waaaay too small!!,37521,2

37523,too short.,37523,2
37523,not flattering,37523,2
37524,Very large.. pretty color,37524,2
37525,"Ordered a size 6 (5'7"" 145lbs) and the armpits ride uncomfortably high.",37525,2
37525,The neckline is high as well.,37525,2
37525,Tough to zipper.,37525,2
37525,"Aside from that, the color is pretty!",37525,2
37525,Wish I could've worn it.,37525,2
37526,"The sneakers looked nice, good fit.",37526,2
37526,"However, after the initial charge and first wear, the lights never charged back up on one of the sneakers.",37526,2
37526,Disappointed with this product.,37526,2
37527,bottoms were HUGE.,37527,2
37527,Purchased a size small.,37527,2
37527,Frustrated.,37527,2
37527,Nice looking suit though.,37527,2
37528,Not a good fit.,37528,2
37528,Seller was great at making things right.,37528,2
37529,This was Christmas gift for my  5 1/2 year old granddaughter.,37529,2
37529,She loved it and put it on right away.,37529,2
37529,By the next day the necklace was broken!,37529,2
37529,Would think that it would have been tested for durability because that's what children do...take it off and put it back on.,37529,2
37529,The set is very pretty and the description was right on.,37529,2
37530,"Not happy about this license plate, the sticker was already coming off when i received it in the mail.",37530,2
37530,:( It's really sad because i was really looking forward to this.,37530,2
37530,It's literally just a plain license plate with a sticker slapped on it.,37530,2
37530,:( saddens me.,37530,2
37531,Sixes way off.,37531,2
37531,Scratchy material,37531,2
37532,Not as nice as the picture.,37532,2
37532,Made with very cheap material.,37532,2
37532,Way too small.,37532,2
37532,Have to bring it to a Taylor to fix it.,37532,2
37533,green eyes don't show in the pix.... very stand out in person.,37533,2
37533,I  find them alittle creepy.,37533,2
37534,Ordered this dress for my sister and I'm not too impressed.,37534,2
37534,The color is off and the style isn't as described.,37534,2
37534,My sister unfortunately hasn't tried it on yet but I'm thinking of just returning it before I give it to her.,37534,2
37534,Plus the chain around the neck is uncomfortable.,37534,2
37535,"Little too heavy made my nipples feel like athletes foot, super sensitive and fiery.",37535,2
37535,If they weren't so heavy it'd be better.,37535,2
37536,didn't fit as well as I thought it would,37536,2
37537,Size is small as mentioned in the listing.,37537,2
37538,The tie is nice.,37538,2
37538,However I ordered BLACK not blue.,37538,2
37538,Disappointed since it is a Christmas gift.,37538,2
37539,"It is not stretchy, it did not have an inner tank as stated.",37539,2
37539,"If it was a longer and had a tank in the same color,, I would love it.",37539,2
37539,Plus it was more orange than pink.,37539,2
37539,I returned it.,37539,2
37539,Quick refund and it is great that returns are so easy..,37539,2
37540,The fabric looks and feels cheap.,37540,2
37540,I expected something better.,37540,2
37541,Did not go to knnes as advertised but calf high only,37541,2
37542,The name of this watch says 'Waterproof' but don't believe it!,37542,2
37542,It was sad because I really liked the watch  otherwise.,37542,2
37542,"Nice sized face, easy to read numbers... the glass was really clear on the face until I had it on while I was giving my kids a bath.",37542,2
37542,Water drops formed under the glass and it only took a few days for it to no longer reliably tell time.,37542,2
37542,"If I could send it back, I would.",37542,2
37543,The buttons starting falling off after first wearing and had to be replaced.,37543,2
37543,They were seen on with barely one thread.,37543,2
37543,Very disappointed.,37543,2
37544,Way too small!,37544,2
37544,"I'm 5'2, 125 curvy and fit.",37544,2
37544,"I ordered a small, so unless you have super small thighs I wouldn't",37544,2
37545,Color didn't match other Maevn uniforms that I already have.,37545,2
37545,Can't add to the mix.,37545,2
37545,That was why I bought this brand online.,37545,2
37545,Color totally different.,37545,2
37546,"The bag was cute & nicely made, however the pocket is soo small that it is absolutely useless!",37546,2
37546,The only thing this bag will hold is some money (loose because a wallet/change purse will never fit) & an id.,37546,2
37546,I'm very disappointed & had to purchase something else for my daughter to use during our disney trip.,37546,2
37547,Doesn't look like the picture,37547,2
37548,"The material is comfortable and unlike most button ups, it fits over my boobs and doesn't make me look 30 lbs heavier.",37548,2
37548,"But really, the style is not as chic as it looks on the model.",37548,2
37548,"The shoulders are so poofy, I look like I walked out of the 70s.",37548,2
37548,"And I'm not small framed, I have pretty wide shoulders (I've been made aware by all the other buttons  ups that make me feel like the Hulk).",37548,2
37548,The poof isn't doing me any favors.,37548,2
37548,I guess I can still wear it with a cardigan though.,37548,2
37549,WAY TOO SMALL!,37549,2
37549,I have another by a different brand in an xl.,37549,2
37549,Ordered this in an xl wouldn't fit it's was like an xs.,37549,2
37549,Which I'm bummed about because the fabric is light and seemed it wouldn't always require layers.,37549,2
37550,The outfit is super cute but it ended up being way too small for my 3 months old baby.,37550,2
37550,I ordered the 6-12 months size and the buttons in the bottom part where the diaper is  kept on getting undone.,37550,2
37550,I resorted to have my son wear a pair of pants underneath this one piece.,37550,2
37550,What a disappointment :(,37550,2
37551,It is so beautiful.,37551,2
37551,I couldn't wait to get i thought it would be a nice thing for the weekend or lunch out with the girls....,37551,2
37551,It is cut  so small.,37551,2
37551,I was so disappointed.,37551,2
37551,I ended up giving it away.,37551,2
37551,It is shipped from overseas.,37551,2
37551,Not happy.,37551,2
37552,Does not fit well at all.,37552,2
37552,"I have an hour glass figure like the model, sorry, but that is not what it looks like while it is on you.",37552,2
37553,"It rolls up from the hips, is difficult to put on by myself and is not hidden under clothing.",37553,2
37553,I think you could probably get the same benefits from a cheaper version.,37553,2
37553,"This being my first baby, I can't speak to if it helps more or not- I do like the support it provided for my back and feeling held together",37553,2
37554,Pants are too large and shirt too tight,37554,2
37555,Extremely small!!!!,37555,2
37555,!,37555,2
37556,puff came loose from handle almost immediately,37556,2
37557,the wore out really fast.,37557,2
37558,This dress was absolutely perfect.,37558,2
37558,"But, my left sleeve has 2 huge holes in them, definitely a defect dress.",37558,2
37558,I bought it for a photoshoot and sadly I couldn't wear it.,37558,2
37558,"Other than it arriving damaged, it's a gorgeous dress.",37558,2
37559,These pajamas are extremely small.,37559,2
37560,I wanted an over sized jacket to wear over winter clothes.,37560,2
37560,Bought a XXL.,37560,2
37560,Fits like a Large.,37560,2
37561,the skirt is too long,37561,2
37562,Love the material  it's a little on the light side and the fit is a little too snug for what I was looking for,37562,2
37563,This Nine West peep toe pump runs very small.,37563,2
37563,"I wear a size 7.5 in all dress shoes, including other Nine West shoes, and other patent peep toe shoes.",37563,2
37563,"However, these ran so small I couldn't get them on.",37563,2
37563,"While I know that most shoes do stretch out, I knew these wouldn't stretch because of the synthetic material.",37563,2
37563,A size 8 might have fit but I ended up selecting a higher quality show at Nordstom.,37563,2
37564,"Fits as advertised, however the product description is incorrect.",37564,2
37564,"It states 95% cotton, but these are in fact 95% viscose.",37564,2
37565,Gift...,37565,2
37566,I got a cat as well and its the same one as what the other person posted.,37566,2
37566,This is so disappointing because it fits perfectly and it feels so comfortable but its just the image!!,37566,2
37566,Would have given 5 stars if only they had the correct picture.,37566,2
37566,The face is also a little off; its not aligned and straight when I wear it,37566,2
37567,The lense on these sunglasses has some kind of distortion or something because They make my vision tired as soon I I put them on.,37567,2
37567,I love how they look and feel but what good is it if I can't wear them.,37567,2
37568,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, the ""scalloped"" parts don't lay flat so it looks odd or even defective.",37568,2
37569,So small there is no chance of wearing it.,37569,2
37569,"I ordered a size above what I'd normally wear to be safe, I don't mind loose tanks, I'd have to update probably 3 sizes for this to work.",37569,2
37569,2 stars because it seems like decent quality and looked just like the pic.,37569,2
37569,Someone at good will gets to try it.,37569,2
37570,I was super excited about this cardigan then opened the package... it looks like a five year old learned how to knit making it.,37570,2
37570,It also had a weird smell to it.,37570,2
37570,"Shame, because it had so much potential.",37570,2
37571,They fit perfect but they rip up in the washer .... not happy with it ....,37571,2
37572,ok,37572,2
37573,I am sad because they fit so well; EXCEPT in the butt.,37573,2
37573,"In the pictures these go straight down, very professional looking.",37573,2
37573,"I do not have a lot in my trunk, yet when I put these on they made that adorable W shape you get when pants hug your tush.",37573,2
37573,Not what I want for work.,37573,2
37573,I had to return them both.,37573,2
37573,"Also worth noting, the gray pants came separately and came nicely packaged.",37573,2
37573,"The black pair I got first came in with no packaging, just thrown in the box my other stuff came in.",37573,2
37573,"Of all my years of many many Amazon orders, this I can truly say was a shocking first.",37573,2
37574,This is a nice quality fabric too but the only downside seems way oversized for the size it is.,37574,2
37574,Good color though!,37574,2
37575,"I figured it was a long shot for this to fit, and unfortunately, I was right.",37575,2
37575,"The front of the bra covered everything just fine, and it was made well, but the straps were way too short.",37575,2
37575,You need to have a very thin frame in order for this to fit over your shoulders and back.,37575,2
37576,I always wear a size small in underwear but not with these.,37576,2
37576,Couldn't get them past my knees!!!,37576,2
37576,Also the jewels look kinda trashy IRL.,37576,2
37577,"PJs are cute, but fit was very small.",37577,2
37577,"My daughter wears 2T PJs so I ordered 3T, but it barely fits her from diaper to shoulders.",37577,2
37577,Disappointed not to get a full season out of this purchase as these are on the expensive side for toddler PJs,37577,2
37578,Thinness is nice but it only fits 3 cards really.,37578,2
37578,Tried to put a 4th card in and it ripped the seam,37578,2
37579,I was dumb enough to order the second....way to big  has to be used for a night shirt,37579,2
37580,Did a decent job but tore up my card,37580,2
37581,They weren't as nice as I hoped for,37581,2
37582,I was expecting the shell to be larger -- it's tiny!,37582,2
37582,I'm not sure if I will wear this with my Ursula costume.,37582,2
37583,The fit and comfort rated high initially (1-2mo).,37583,2
37583,I am an active plus sized fitness instructor.,37583,2
37583,My relationship with this brand ended abruptly when the pants split from front to back at the bottom of a squat in the middle of class.,37583,2
37583,I bought a few pairs.,37583,2
37583,"The additional pairs have held up, but only for casual around town use.",37583,2
37584,Too small.,37584,2
37584,Requested a return slip.,37584,2
37584,Company stated they would give me a discount.,37584,2
37584,I should give the skirt to a friend.,37584,2
37584,Didn't want to order anything else because things are to small.,37584,2
37584,"Emailed amazon,  didn't hear anything back.",37584,2
37585,Made out of very cheap material.,37585,2
37585,Zipper is also very cheap.,37585,2
37585,Was not happy with this purchase.,37585,2
37586,Indesiderati pocket came broken so it is not possible to use as a pocket because things go through.,37586,2
37587,The pink ones are not 100% cotton like the black ones and I was allergic to them.,37587,2
37588,The Hoodie was great but the zipper broke instantly.,37588,2
37588,"Had it replaced, zipper broke again first time it was unzipped.",37588,2
37588,Returned for refund.,37588,2
37589,Cute but too small.,37589,2
37589,I guess the sizes we use for our 5 years olds is considered a size for a 2 year old where they make these outfits.,37589,2
37590,Not very sticky so this product really doesn't work.,37590,2
37590,Put in a hat and fell right out.,37590,2
37591,I don't know if this is Fox fur or something else.,37591,2
37591,The quality is NOT what I paid for.,37591,2
37591,So disappointed.....,37591,2
37592,One size too small.,37592,2
37592,Not a size 8.,37592,2
37593,Loved the color perfect for hunting but size runs really small will be returning,37593,2
37594,I was happy that it arrived way sooner than I expected but it was like I was too tall or something almost...as soon as I put the bottom part on the rest couldn't reach up to my shoulders for me to try to put my arms in it...mime me I'm only 5'7...so yeah it was just wayyy to small...if it would have fit I would have loved it,37594,2
37595,This thing is garbage - probably why it's only 4 bucks (should be free).,37595,2
37595,Nobody can tell there are shells in it - just a tacky piece of opaque blue plastic.,37595,2
37596,I'm a little under 5ft.,37596,2
37596,2in and I'm afraid that when I wash it it might shrink and be too short .,37596,2
37596,"Sizing runs large,should have returned it ,but will find someone to donate it to.",37596,2
37596,Was very disappointed in this item I have ordered from them before but don't know if I will again,37596,2
37597,The color was not as pictured and I ended up giving it away.,37597,2
37598,I wore my new pants to work today to try them out.,37598,2
37598,"I am a 6'4"", 300 pound individual.",37598,2
37598,"I ordered their largest size, 42"" waist in the coffee color.",37598,2
37598,The color is exactly as described.,37598,2
37598,The pockets are exactly as I desired.,37598,2
37598,The waist fits... just.,37598,2
37598,"However, the crotch and thighs are very tight.",37598,2
37598,"It seems unlikely that I will be able to wear these again after washing them, as the fabric can be expected to shrink to some degree.",37598,2
37598,"They do not have the relaxed fit I was hoping for, and which seemed to be suggested by the photograph.",37598,2
37598,I suspect a thinner individual will find these ideal.,37598,2
37598,"If they had a larger size, I would try ordering it, but sadly this is the upper limit of their size selection for this product.",37598,2
37599,Gave it to my daughter,37599,2
37600,Last minute thing so I purchased.,37600,2
37600,Fits bigger than expected.,37600,2
37600,Material will make you sweat so much and its just foam.,37600,2
37601,Definitely not the size ordered XXL and it is more like a Small.,37601,2
37602,VERY CHEAP MATERIAL BUT GOT THE JOB DONE,37602,2
37603,Poor quality,37603,2
37604,The zipper broke after 2 weeks :(,37604,2
37605,Cute.,37605,2
37605,Doesn't fit right,37605,2
37606,"The price was good, so I took a chance.",37606,2
37606,I can't really walk around the house with the top half of my breasts showing because the nursing flaps aren't wide enough to close.,37606,2
37606,I need to wear a bathrobe over it in the mornings so I don't expose myself to other family members!,37606,2
37607,"pretty dress but to small got an XL and is more likely XS the seller needs to be honest about the measurements of the cloth they sale I had to give it away to a person who is size 0 and it fit perfect to her, if she gain a pound it won't fit thanks no reimbursement",37607,2
37608,The design of this wallet is flawed as it does not ever open all the way and the bend marks in the wallet are very noticeable.,37608,2
37608,The pictures also make it look smaller than it actually is and the real thing was large enough to fill my entire wallet pocket.,37608,2
37608,"It is a nice leather inside and did ship in much less time than it said, but I would not buy again and I'd look elsewhere for a wallet.",37608,2
37609,The shirt is okay just definitely what i expected.,37609,2
37609,Looks nothing like the picture not even to the color.,37609,2
37610,Ok.,37610,2
37610,But a little too yellowy.,37610,2
37610,"Cute for the money, sturdy enough, just too yellow.",37610,2
37610,"Doesn't look real, not that I expect it to REALLY look real, I just don't want it to stand out as obviously fake, gumball-machine looking.",37610,2
37610,Which unfortunately it kinda does.,37610,2
37611,"The material doesn't last long, I have to buy a new one",37611,2
37612,Bought it for my 10 month old.,37612,2
37612,Too small and it has a lot of thread sticking out.,37612,2
37612,Doesn't look as nice up close,37612,2
37613,I ordered this shirt to wear to a concert this weekend.,37613,2
37613,I ordered a Medium cuz it's a Men's shirt.,37613,2
37613,I always wear a M in men's.,37613,2
37613,Lilittle to me surprise its to small.,37613,2
37613,Very sad!!,37613,2
37613,I read the reviews before ordering and not one person said it run small.,37613,2
37614,I would like to say first off these earing are truly beautiful.,37614,2
37614,They are exactly what i wanted and what i hoped i was ordering.,37614,2
37614,The only thing that i can say negatively is that one pair came with both posts broken off and as i went to put in one of the other sets the post fell off as i was taking the back off of it.,37614,2
37614,This is really disappointing when i felt that i had taken over 3 days searching for what i felt where the best sets i could get.,37614,2
37614,"True they were not expensive so i understand the "" you get what you pay for"" bit but to come already broken and to break in your hands is the reason i have to give a less than perfect review.",37614,2
37614,Like i said these earing are beautiful and i would get the again but only if i knew that they were made better.,37614,2
37615,"Judging from other reviews of this top, I ordered a large vs. my usual small.",37615,2
37615,I could wear it like a dress but that would look ridiculous.,37615,2
37615,I think it came from China so it's not worth the effort to return it.,37615,2
37615,"I like the logo, so it'll probably become part of a t shirt quilt.",37615,2
37616,Super cute and fit perfectly until I washed it and it shrunk A LOT!,37616,2
37616,Disappointment for sure,37616,2
37617,"The product held my breast up decently, but DEFIENTLY was not invisible.",37617,2
37617,You seen it right through my dress,37617,2
37618,Turn tio.,37618,2
37618,Copper to.,37618,2
37618,Quickly,37618,2
37619,I had high hopes because the suit is adorable.,37619,2
37619,"Unfortunately, even ordering as big as they go (I'm a size 16, but busty) I could never wear the top in public, it was waaayyyy too small in the cups.",37619,2
37620,Fell apart the first time I wore it :(,37620,2
37621,"Love the fit, the style also.",37621,2
37621,I was looking for a white tank top but unfortunately this one is see through.,37621,2
37622,Pocket was ripped.,37622,2
37622,Poor quality,37622,2
37623,These are very sheer.,37623,2
37623,Which I suppose is ok if you want an undershirt.,37623,2
37623,"Although why people think little girls need undershirts is beyond me, unless it's for warmth in the wintertime.",37623,2
37623,I wanted these to use as tank tops in hot weather.,37623,2
37623,"Just plain, simple, shirts for play.",37623,2
37623,They are way to sheer for that purpose.,37623,2
37623,Might as just have her run around in the yard in her diaper if the weather is warm.,37623,2
37623,"Otherwise, they are nicely cut, they look like they are a good length (will actually cover the tummy, unlike some other tops).",37623,2
37624,Itchy material.,37624,2
37624,It looks way different from the picture :(,37624,2
37625,Took reviewer's advice and ordered up a couple sizes.,37625,2
37625,Got an XL and it's considerably large around the waist.,37625,2
37625,"I'm 6ft, 165lbs, 32in waist.",37625,2
37625,Pouch is great compared to traditional long johns.,37625,2
37626,"Love the cut of the length of the coat and the stand collar, however it was too small, I wear a medium US so I ordered a XXL, should have gone with a XXXL, the coat is a lot thinner than I had thought as well.",37626,2
37627,I am short waisted but can get away with wearing some unaltered dresses.,37627,2
37627,"This dress didn't work at all, unfortunately.",37627,2
37627,"I had far too much fabric at my shoulders, even when the dress fit well over the rest of my body.",37627,2
37627,The fabric is not comfortable as well.,37627,2
37627,"Thick and suffocating feeling, I imagine it would be very uncomfortable in the heat.",37627,2
37628,I debated for a long time between this product and Bellefit.,37628,2
37628,I ended up getting both thinking that Belly Bandit BFF would be easier to get in and out of it especially for the first couple of weeks when I would need to breastfeed constantly and get in and out of bed frequently.,37628,2
37628,"While it is true that Belly bandit's Velcro feature made it easier and quicker to wear and take off when I needed, the band ended up getting permanent crease after one wear that cannot be undone no matter what I do (as many reviewers said here).",37628,2
37628,"The band still does its job with the crease, but it is very disappointing given how much I paid for this.",37628,2
37629,There are time when PRL L is perfect size & this time it ran smaller.,37629,2
37630,"It isn't red, more a burnt orange.",37630,2
37630,It was not as flattering as I hoped...but would likely look nice on someone thinner.,37630,2
37630,It also had a petroleum smell to it.,37630,2
37630,I hope my return will be easy.,37630,2
37631,Not really what I was going for.,37631,2
37631,"I'm sure it might work for someone else, but not me.",37631,2
37631,Fabric was kinds cheap but again for the price you get what you pay for.,37631,2
37632,I mean.,37632,2
37632,.,37632,2
37632,.,37632,2
37632,.,37632,2
37632,It looks cheap.,37632,2
37632,Does not have the chiffon look as in the picture.,37632,2
37632,I order a lot of clothes from over seas and I prefer the quality of ALLEGRA K.,37632,2
37633,To small,37633,2
37634,"They have a nice fit and they are comfortable, but they break easily on the seams.",37634,2
37635,I returned it because I could not fit into the top.,37635,2
37635,I looked at the size chart and tried to best gauge the right size but it was still way too small.,37635,2
37636,"It's a nice color, but the chest area is immense, and some of the gems won't stay in place.",37636,2
37636,"My daughter was so excited to get it, but was extremely disappointed when it was too big on her.",37636,2
37637,Very pretty  .. but mine came broken.,37637,2
37637,So I had to trash it .was not even able to fit it,37637,2
37638,"This pullover just did not feel right to me on my skin...To me it looks great in the picture...But, the feel and fit , just did not work for me at all.",37638,2
37639,do not fit as advertised,37639,2
37640,Necklace broke within a day of wearing it.,37640,2
37641,I absolutely love the color and the fabric quality.,37641,2
37641,"However, when I tried it on for the first time, the elastic completely broke and the wrap became unwearable.",37641,2
37641,I am a size 8 and purposely ordered larger (XXL) than I needed so it would be longer and looser...so I know the elastic did not break because it was too small for me.,37641,2
37641,It was just not well made.,37641,2
37641,:-(,37641,2
37642,I did not like this product.,37642,2
37642,It did not do what I expected.,37642,2
37643,This was WAY too short to wear as a dress and also see through.,37643,2
37643,"Pity, because the color was amazing.",37643,2
37643,I returned the dress,37643,2
37644,It is cute but it doesnt stay together mine keeps falling apart,37644,2
37645,I gave it away,37645,2
37646,"Great fabric and design and it fits very well, too.",37646,2
37646,"When I got it, I put it through one wash/dry cycle and the design is already starting to peel off.",37646,2
37646,"Unfortunately, I can't recommend this.",37646,2
37647,The pattern is rad but they definitely run small and don't stretch very much.,37647,2
37648,"They were much longer than I expected...I am 5 feet tall and about 125 lbs...lots of extra length didn't expect it from  ""free "" size.",37648,2
37649,Really disappointed in this.,37649,2
37649,"Ordered the M/L because I wear a size 10 and I could barely get on, when I squeezed into it the lining like cut into my inner thigh.",37649,2
37649,Not comfy.,37649,2
37649,Will not be wearing sadly.,37649,2
37650,Shoe was ok but not worth the wait.,37650,2
37650,I think the company took over 45 days to fulfill the order.,37650,2
37651,good quality just too small,37651,2
37652,I feel like a brick in this dress.,37652,2
37652,"The arms fit as expected, and it looks cute in theory, but it has NO shape.",37652,2
37652,"It might look cute with a waist belt, but I don't have one, so I'm a little sad.",37652,2
37653,This did not fit the way it does in the picture.,37653,2
37653,I returned.,37653,2
37654,"the bottom piece is a high cut, although the bra si padded it does not hold my my boobs, no support at all, Im 5'8, 170 lbs and 36d, I bought a medium.",37654,2
37654,"Everything else fit but the top part, i can not wear this to go anywhere but the bedroom, so im be wearing it as a lingerie <smile>.",37654,2
37654,Im not sure if I bought a small if it would fit better..,37654,2
37655,"This is my second time getting this item , the first one was large to small ok fine , I love it so much I got the 2xx fits just like the large or smaller and I lost 8lb come on now what a wast",37655,2
37656,Not what I expected.,37656,2
37656,It looks red online but once you get it's an off red,37656,2
37657,Super cheap material,37657,2
37658,See through.,37658,2
37658,I need to return it.,37658,2
37659,Did not like.,37659,2
37659,Looks better in picture,37659,2
37660,I thought it would be longer and baggy it fits but not loose.,37660,2
37660,also the print sticks together after drying.,37660,2
37660,still cute,37660,2
37661,a little smaller than expected even though it is stretchy but sill nice and sparkly,37661,2
37662,Not Jean material and its not form flattering,37662,2
37663,Really weird fit.,37663,2
37663,The pocket is under my arm haha !,37663,2
37663,!,37663,2
37664,I returned this band.,37664,2
37664,It was extremely big and aside from that was very thin and cheap looking.,37664,2
37664,It looked tarnished and felt like it would bend very easily.,37664,2
37665,This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.,37665,2
37665,"This works well enough as a swimsuit, however, there were some issues I found.",37665,2
37665,Visually it looks quite different in the picture than in person.,37665,2
37665,"In the picture, it looks like a moderately well made swimsuit, but in person, it looks very cheaply made.",37665,2
37665,"The blues on the top look close in color in the pictures, but definitely not in person, the pattern is far more pronounced (which I did not like, or I would have gotten the darker colored one).",37665,2
37665,"The little dots look like they could be sequins, sparkly cloth, rhinestones or beads but in person, they are solid little dots of colored cloth.",37665,2
37665,I was quite disappointed in this one.,37665,2
37666,"Not made for people over 5'3"" also it doesn't look like the picture.",37666,2
37666,Still kinda cute.,37666,2
37666,Gave it to my 9 year old daughter.,37666,2
37667,"It's a completely different suit than the pictures...I do like it, I think it's so cute in a sexy way.",37667,2
37667,But it's definitely an attempted copy of the suit in the pictures.,37667,2
37667,"The bottoms fit great, very cheeky!",37667,2
37667,The top did not cover my nipples and I had major underboob going on.,37667,2
37667,"I have pretty big boobs compared to the rest of my body so I wasn't surprised but never in my life have I fit into a medium but with this, I was literally spilling out of the top.",37667,2
37667,So it most definitely runs super small.,37667,2
37667,"The padding shows through the top too which looks awkward and your nips will show a bit when the pads are taken out so pick your awkwardness I guess...I still like the suit and if I can't figure out the top, I'll just get a different top and wear the bottoms.",37667,2
37668,Very bizarre fitting.,37668,2
37668,"The bottom half fit perfectly, but the top cups are a very weird and hard shape.",37668,2
37668,"It didn't sit well against my body and ""puckered"" out if that makes any sense.",37668,2
37668,I didn't feel comfortable bending over.,37668,2
37668,I had to return it.,37668,2
37668,It's super cute though.,37668,2
37668,I was disappointed that it didn't fit right.,37668,2
37669,It was too big.,37669,2
37669,But a nice dress.,37669,2
37669,Thank u!!,37669,2
37669,!,37669,2
37670,Great quality cute shirt BUT Very tight fit order one or two sizes up,37670,2
37671,too small not a size for our women,37671,2
37672,For the price..,37672,2
37672,The products are quite overprice @ $14.99 a piece.,37672,2
37672,"Quality wise, Just One Star..",37672,2
37672,"Sorry, Not Satisfied.",37672,2
37672,"I'm only keeping
One(1) unit of the Sunglasses.. ( I Ordered 3 pcs.. Based only on the Picture Samples ) I will be Sending back Two (2) units..
Hopefully, I'll get a better quality next time.",37672,2
37672,Kindly Refund' me for the two items I'm returning..,37672,2
37672,Truly Yours' .. RB Seruelo..,37672,2
37673,"Beautiful color and exactly as shows, but size and quality of material is way too thin and buttons were practically falling off.",37673,2
37674,"Cute, but the kitty came without gems in its eyes",37674,2
37675,This was way too small for me.,37675,2
37675,Order up.,37675,2
37676,too small and don't really like the fabic,37676,2
37677,"Cool looks,  cheap finish.",37677,2
37677,The edges were sharp m afraid it will bruise my ear.,37677,2
37677,I wouldn't buy it again.,37677,2
37678,This runs very big,37678,2
37679,Sleeve too tight can't fit in it.,37679,2
37679,"And I bought a size M, I usually am a size S...",37679,2
37680,Definitely not as pictured.,37680,2
37681,Literally the only girl or feminine BB-8 shirt that I have found.,37681,2
37681,The fit is rather odd.,37681,2
37681,Very short and wide.,37681,2
37681,The material is thin but soft and Jersey like.,37681,2
37682,I was not too happy with the quality or fit.,37682,2
37682,I would not recommend these to anyone with large hips or a butt.,37682,2
37683,Wore this over the weekend for a late Halloween costume party.,37683,2
37683,This gave me the desired 60s era look but the adhesive is very low quality and the mustache would not stay adhered.,37683,2
37683,"Everyone kept saying it was crooked, and I finally just peeled it off.",37683,2
37683,Would not buy again or recommend this product.,37683,2
37684,Pretty dress.,37684,2
37684,Sizes run small.,37684,2
37684,Exchanging is a hassle.,37684,2
37685,Item was not as described.,37685,2
37685,Picture shows a gold chain link that's attached to the ring.,37685,2
37685,Instead it's an elastic band.,37685,2
37685,"Really disappointed, also, really small in size compared to what's out in the market these days.",37685,2
37685,Lastly the color is Hot Pink,37685,2
37686,Way too thin.,37686,2
37686,If I wanted tights I would have bought them.,37686,2
37686,Returned without trying on because it wouldn't have mattered.,37686,2
37687,I asked for the dress in an extra large and it is too too small and see through.,37687,2
37688,"I like the clasp in the front, but that's about all I can say.",37688,2
37688,"First, it is too small and I am BARELY a C-cup, so it should have fit great.",37688,2
37688,"Second, it wouldn't stick on the sides, so it feels like it's constantly going to come off.",37688,2
37688,"But I DO like that, with less revealing tops, all you can see is the added cleavage ;)",37688,2
37689,It was not a flattering fit.,37689,2
37689,It was like in between a sheath skirt and a A-line.,37689,2
37689,It just looked weird on.,37689,2
37689,"I'm 5'6"" 140 lbs.",37689,2
37689,I loved the pattern and really wanted this to work out for me.,37689,2
37690,Fits as expected.,37690,2
37690,I like this brand but these seemed different than the last ones I got at a department store.,37690,2
37690,Material seems thin.,37690,2
37690,I don't like the large tag.,37690,2
37690,It pokes me.,37690,2
37690,It isn't the type you could take out as they did a really good job of attaching the tag.,37690,2
37690,I was planning on buying more but after getting these and trying them out I won't be.,37690,2
37690,I can get over the thinner than expected material because that doesn't bother me.,37690,2
37690,Perhaps they won't last as long.,37690,2
37690,It is the tag that pokes me that is a showstopper for me.,37690,2
37691,The fur went flying everywhere!,37691,2
37691,Looks very expensive-- if you don't mind fur in your mouth!,37691,2
37691,Gave to my friend and she seemed not to mind.,37691,2
37692,It did fit nicely however there were so many snags and small holes that I returned it.,37692,2
37692,It was a shame because it was cute.,37692,2
37692,But for 26$ I would expect better quality.,37692,2
37693,It was to small but gave itvto my daughter.,37693,2
37694,"far too small, does not have anything to do with american sizes.",37694,2
37694,"Next time I will check the source country and if it is produced in the far East, I will not order.",37694,2
37695,I could not get it over my hips and I'm normal size 8 or 10.,37695,2
37695,I ordered a large size and had to send it back because the material was not stretchy enough for me to get the swimsuit on.,37695,2
37696,I like the style but it's a little too large for me,37696,2
37697,The sizing is way off on these jerseys.,37697,2
37697,"I had to give my XL to my 5'4"" wife.",37697,2
37697,It fits her pretty well.,37697,2
37698,The shoes are made big.,37698,2
37698,I returned the original size I ordered.,37698,2
37698,The correct size fit great and gave my 2 year old great traction in and out of the pool.,37698,2
37698,After using them for 5 hours he had blisters on the inside of his feet.,37698,2
37698,We won't be using these anymore.,37698,2
37699,"want to like the dress as been searching for lace white dress
and saw this in amazon, reading raving good reviews and decide to get one
disappoint, not only came with holes, many of them but also the quality isn't there
the fabrics quality/laces constructions, this won't last however they are soft
sizing: true to size (women), as small bit big on me, should getting xs
my size is xs - s (depends on brands/cutting); 5 in junior dept.",37699,2
37699,"for the price we pay, above 25 the quality isn't there,
saw many selling similar for 16 or less
paying less (i.e brand volcom, below 20) all of them are 10 times
not only nicer but also having way better quality,,
learning lesson; shopping online always listen to the real reviewers,
buyer who pay full price (not those who getting free stuffs, end up raving and give high ratings)
and high price or good ratings isn't necessarily good item",37699,2
37700,The sizing chart runs way small I even went a size up because I read the reviews and that said they run small so if your a 10 u need to get a 2 xx extra large .,37700,2
37700,The material is not that great but for the price it's ok .,37700,2
37701,"Cute, good quality-  just very very small.",37701,2
37702,See-through and bunches at the top  But it's ok at best,37702,2
37703,Returning the product.,37703,2
37703,The fabric is very soft.,37703,2
37703,"The rhinestones on this veil
 Are too big and you can see the black underneath them.",37703,2
37703,The veil looks like there are polka dots all over it instead of rhinestones,37703,2
37704,Too small,37704,2
37705,"This was super janky, but you don't get what you don't pay for I guess.",37705,2
37706,The waistband elastic is flimsy.,37706,2
37706,The panties seemed a little tight.,37706,2
37706,They are going back.,37706,2
37707,Very cute but fits like a kids size,37707,2
37708,"It looks cheap, and the color is not what is on the website.",37708,2
37708,It's looks better online than in person.,37708,2
37708,I was a little bit disappointed.,37708,2
37709,"I bought a size bigger than my size and it felt as if two sizes too small, doesn't quite look like picture either.",37709,2
37710,"Even after ordering a size up, this item came out of the washer/dryer looking like something that should fit a 12 year old child.",37710,2
37710,EEK.,37710,2
37710,"If you buy, I'd suggest at least 2 sizes up.",37710,2
37711,Nothing about the product but I prefer a smaller bag and it was much bigger than I planned when I received it,37711,2
37712,"I actually LOVED this bracelet, the design is nice, but then again, the chain snapped on the third use because material is so cheap!",37712,2
37713,Bought an xL but it was a large,37713,2
37714,Cut across the bust is not proportionate to the waist and hip area.,37714,2
37714,Way too small across the bust.,37714,2
37714,Everything else fits fine.,37714,2
37714,It is a beautiful dress though.,37714,2
37714,Very sexy.,37714,2
37715,Ordered a size larger than what I needed and it's too small for my 11 year old.,37715,2
37716,"This had a cute design, but fit super weird on me (and I ordered my normal size) It felt tight in the arms and across the shoulders, so there was no way I could keep it.",37716,2
37716,"The red color was pretty however, and if you can find a size that feels ok on you, the style of the dress is flattering to hide any tummy insecurities.",37716,2
37716,"I did find the part that you are supposed to move aside to nurse a little tight too however, and didn't think it would be super easy to nurse in.",37716,2
37716,Definitely buy bigger than your normal size.,37716,2
37717,"Liitle bit too small, but nice.",37717,2
37718,The colors are true to the picture however there is not a single bit of stretching knees so they are not very comfortable.,37718,2
37718,I like my leggings to be a little stretchy so I can walk.,37718,2
37719,I absolutely love this bag!,37719,2
37719,But.... the clasp on the strap broke the first day.,37719,2
37719,So I just used it without the strap.,37719,2
37719,Then about a week after that the zipper broke.,37719,2
37719,To clarify I have used the purse as an everyday bag.,37719,2
37719,I theb returned the bag and purchased another as I still really liked the bag.,37719,2
37719,Basically the same problems within a few days.,37719,2
37719,I replaced the hardware and the bag is great.,37719,2
37719,I just wish it would have been made with quality metal clasps and zippers.,37719,2
37720,I've purchased several of these to wear after my c-section since I could not yet wear my normal panties without them irritating my incision.,37720,2
37720,"The panties have a silicone strip right where your incision is located, the silicone will help flatten and minimize your scar, but you have to make sure when you put these on that the silicone is lined up with your scar.",37720,2
37720,"You can alternatively buy silicone strips made for c sections and apply them directly to your skin, which I think is better since you know the silicone is properly covering your incision.",37720,2
37720,Postpartum I was initially 165 but I still purchased them in small hoping for a bit of compression at the sight of my incision because it felt so much more comfortable that way.,37720,2
37720,The material itself is almost too stretchy and doesn't really support your postpartum stomach.,37720,2
37720,"Also, the way the material at the top of the panty is so much tighter than the stomach part ends up making you look a little more lumpy under clothes.",37720,2
37720,"I didn't expect the full compression you would get from a postpartum corset obviously, but if the entire panty were made with the same material they use at the top of the panty to hold it up I think you'd get a lot better support overall.",37720,2
37720,The package states it supports your abdominal muscles and so I am subtracting a star since I don't really agree with that claim.,37720,2
37720,I also subtracted a star because these roll down and the top bunches a bit.,37720,2
37720,"Even after losing a ton of weight, these still roll down at the top.",37720,2
37720,If the tops had the little silicone strips to hold them up (like most shapewear) I think it would alleviate this problem.,37720,2
37720,Minus one more star because these are not worth 40$ overall.,37720,2
37720,I spent 160$ on 4 of these and I think I would have been better off with an extra postpartum corset and silicone strips.,37720,2
37721,"I keep forgetting that a lot of these companies view real women as super model thin, This was too small for my daughter and cheaply made.",37721,2
37721,It was a cute idea though.,37721,2
37722,petite size,37722,2
37723,Beautiful item from the beginning but brakes down within a week!,37723,2
37724,Nice pants but it fits tight.,37724,2
37724,It is not loose.,37724,2
37725,Too small for us.,37725,2
37726,Had holes in it when I first opened it.,37726,2
37726,Looks smaller than what it should be for its size.,37726,2
37726,Looks cheap.,37726,2
37727,very cheaply made material is so thin you can see bra through it,37727,2
37728,Didn't fit in the chest or arms.,37728,2
37729,"Bad quality, diferrent colores to the picture",37729,2
37730,"looks cute, but I am not sure how it looks on me... it's not a medium!",37730,2
37730,it was more like a small or XS =(,37730,2
37731,I purchased these based on other clothing I have by this brand.,37731,2
37731,These are too small and scratchy.,37731,2
37731,Plus I don't think they had an elastic waist.,37731,2
37731,I don't like tie only waist bands.,37731,2
37731,And these run smaller than other jogger pants I own in this brand.,37731,2
37731,"I have L and they fit fine - just slightly small, so I figured XXL would be plenty big, but they were not.",37731,2
37731,They are not the smooth comfy cotton that my other pants by this label are.,37731,2
37732,Cheap looking but still pretty diamond was falling out already,37732,2
37733,"Gave it my friend,",37733,2
37734,I bought an XL of this top.,37734,2
37734,It literally looks like a it should be for a little girl.,37734,2
37734,A large little girl.,37734,2
37734,"If you are a normal sized woman, i doubt this shirt will fit you.",37734,2
37734,Will be getting rid of.,37734,2
37734,Not happy.,37734,2
37735,It was good and much smaller than predicted larger image circumflex,37735,2
37736,"I gave to my non-plus size friend...  She didn't like the 2x in her closet with all her larges, but it fits her perfectly.",37736,2
37736,:(,37736,2
37737,The sleeve is more of a light green instead of blue.,37737,2
37737,"I'm a medium and ordered a large, and it just fits.",37737,2
37737,Looks cheap,37737,2
37738,"I am 5 foot 5, 145 pounds.",37738,2
37738,I bought a size large and the top was a bit on the small side.,37738,2
37738,"The bottoms were way to small, not even close to fitting.",37738,2
37739,These pants certainly are not loose fitting.,37739,2
37739,Very poor representation by Carhartt.,37739,2
37740,Meh,37740,2
37741,"product looks old fashioned, side zippers are covered in picture, too small",37741,2
37742,They didn't look anything like the picture.,37742,2
37742,They was so rose gold.,37742,2
37743,tight in waste loose on the bust it didn't work out,37743,2
37744,I like it and it broke today after five weeks of wear.,37744,2
37744,Trying to fix the break.,37744,2
37744,The band wears very nicely and looks very clean and handsome.,37744,2
37745,"I bought this product on January 11th, it doesn't I am a size extra small and petite.",37745,2
37745,I bought a size medium.,37745,2
37745,This does not fit like the picture.,37745,2
37745,It fits just fine on the arm and doesn't close cause the stitching is all off.,37745,2
37745,There is no type of elastic in this romper.,37745,2
37745,If your expecting to fit nice and tight or lose like the picture just don't.,37745,2
37745,I'm refunding this product because it's not as advertised and my refund is Also taking forever.,37745,2
37746,"While I loved the color, I wish I had purchased a size larger.",37746,2
37746,It's a little snug around my chest (38DD).,37746,2
37746,And the material is a little thicker and more textured than I expected.,37746,2
37747,Not how the picture is shown.....,37747,2
37747,The quality is fine.,37747,2
37747,Not too heavy.,37747,2
37747,The picture shows the colors are orange and turquoise throughout.,37747,2
37747,But the small dot beads are instead pink and red.,37747,2
37747,And there three different colors of blue/green.,37747,2
37747,I would have not ordered if I would have known the variation.,37747,2
37747,...,37747,2
37748,did not fit well,37748,2
37749,This dress is cute but...the top is very very thin.,37749,2
37749,Read other reviews and it does run a little bit larger than your normal size.,37749,2
37749,Will be a nice dress for the holidays as long as you wear another shirt over the top.,37749,2
37749,Not worth the cost.,37749,2
37750,Not bad.,37750,2
37750,Writing is very faded.,37750,2
37750,Colours are faded I'm worried about washing them.,37750,2

37750,2 pocket pants?,37750,2
37750,Had one pocket.,37750,2
37750,Confused.,37750,2
37750,Size large completely fell apart and the elastic waistband snapped and broke in the pants,37750,2
37751,Received all crushed up into pieces did return & received a new one very soon but tarnished after awhile.,37751,2
37751,You get what you pay for.,37751,2
37752,Appears to be brownish and tinted around the edge with this white substance (probably glue).,37752,2
37753,it fit well except that the straps do not look anything like the ones in the picture.,37753,2
37753,I had to fit them on my own.,37753,2
37754,I thought it would be better quality,37754,2
37755,I couldn't get my 2 years old's hands into the glove.,37755,2
37755,We ended up with them halfway on during the Blizzard of 2016 so he was playing around like he had a flipper.,37755,2
37755,They look like they would stretch more with the adjustable band.,37755,2
37755,They don't.,37755,2
37756,It's a very nice style but the material seems a bit on the cheap side and it gives zero support if you are bigger up top.,37756,2
37756,I am returning mine.,37756,2
37757,"The shirt looks good and fits well across the shoulders ect, but it is way to short and will have to be worn unbuttoned with a shirt underneath.",37757,2
37758,Very see thru not thick at all,37758,2
37759,I got these for my wife as she needed inexpensive sandals to wear in the shower.,37759,2
37759,"She wears size 6 shoes, so we tried Asian 37 (US 6), but they were a bit too small (not snug - the width was not an issue).",37759,2
37759,"In retrospect, the next size up would have been a better choice.",37759,2
37759,"Although they are very light and as comfortable as you would expect from a sandal in this price range (there is no arch support), the bottom has already torn after about a week and a half of light use.",37759,2
37759,"Also, there was a very strong chemical smell upon receiving them, which took a few days to dissipate.",37759,2
37759,"Based on the observed poor durability, we will not be reordering.",37759,2
37760,Horrible too freakin small,37760,2
37761,The fit is great.,37761,2
37761,But the pattern is a little off.,37761,2
37761,Not sure how that happened.,37761,2
37762,cool looking but can't wear.,37762,2
37762,"way too small, gave to my wife to wear instead.",37762,2
37763,It doens't fit very well and the material is weird.,37763,2
37763,Very thin and see through.,37763,2
37764,"Do not order a size up, it kind of fits awkwardly and if you order up it will look way too big",37764,2
37765,Everything is well with this product except the size.,37765,2
37765,"The length is good, however, the width is small and I never need to buy wide shoes or wide footwear of any kind :( it might be the strap itself that's a little small.",37765,2
37765,I bought a different pare of flip flops along with these and the other pair I bought fit perfectly.,37765,2
37765,The other pair I bought were puma's and they were the same price as these,37765,2
37766,"They feel great and super soft, however the sizing was completely off.",37766,2
37766,Too small!,37766,2
37766,I wear a size 18 and these hardly fit over my hips.,37766,2
37767,It's a great fashion statement but fits really uncomfortable around the shoulders and arms.,37767,2
37768,The top fit great but it was extremely short on me.,37768,2
37768,It was almost like a long shirt on me.,37768,2
37768,I will have to add some fabric to the bottom to make it longer.,37768,2
37769,Very beautiful ring.,37769,2
37769,"Shipped perfectly on time, all of my coworkers and friends loved the ring and compliment me with it.",37769,2
37769,Today at work 3/24 I rubbed the ring against the counter in reflex from an object squishing my hands n the dime in the center popped out.,37769,2
37769,I'm not without a nice ring.,37769,2
37769,Great product but wouldn't wear it everyday just special occassion,37769,2
37770,Its hard to put & take out cards.,37770,2
37771,Cute but a little confusing to put on and the bottom is too big.,37771,2
37771,Wanted to return but didn't know if I could because it's a bathing suit,37771,2
37772,Material is very poor quality.,37772,2
37772,Overall pretty dress for the price,37772,2
37773,Looked beautiful but of poor quality.,37773,2
37773,I only wore it once and the latchet snapped,37773,2
37774,"dress was way too small even though it was XL
Sizing off",37774,2
37775,the color was not at all like the picture.,37775,2
37775,These earrings are dark green,37775,2
37776,Arms are very tight,37776,2
37777,Beautiful dress but it was too big and most of the seams were coming undone or not finished completely.,37777,2
37777,The top of the zipper was completely sewn onto the dress.,37777,2
37778,odd fit,37778,2
37779,The item arrived on time but when I opened it had a very bad smell and I put it back in the package.,37779,2
37779,I contacted the seller and the company gave a % back for the trouble.,37779,2
37779,The item was too big for my wife.,37779,2
37779,"I ordered small, she is 106 pounds, 5' 3 tall.",37779,2
37779,The smell went away after the first wash. Material is according to the price.,37779,2
37780,Really cheap material.,37780,2
37780,The fit is off and the design is not flattering.,37780,2
37780,I ended up returning it.,37780,2
37780,The colors were nice together but the fabric and fit were not happening.,37780,2
37780,I really wanted to like this dress but it's more like a cheap costume of sorts.,37780,2
37781,I got a size bigger than what I usually wear and it's still too small....,37781,2
37782,This item was poorly made and broke more than once.,37782,2
37782,I attempted to fix it but it broke every time I tried to wear it.,37782,2
37783,"As much as the reviews say that this comes in small size, mine came on the bigger side.",37783,2
37783,"I'm 5 ft, 111 pound woman
and the medium I ordered was big on me.",37783,2
37783,"The fitting is kinda weird, the off shoulders sleeves are too loose and pull down.",37783,2
37783,I have to wear a vest to make it work.,37783,2
37784,Not for nipples larger than a pencil eraser.,37784,2
37785,I had to give it to my daughter.,37785,2
37786,I would recommend you go up a size.,37786,2
37787,"Super comfortable, but too translucent.",37787,2
37787,I was looking for something summer-weight I could wear around my 12 year old son...,37787,2
37787,This would've fit the bill except it is very see through.,37787,2
37788,I am small on top and this was too tight.,37788,2
37788,Skirt has only a Velcro closure at top and rest is open.,37788,2
37788,Didn't like the way it fit too high on waist with the closure.,37788,2
37788,"Maybe the large would have fit better, but its really cheaply made so returned with no exchange.",37788,2
37789,Product is super cute and looks great on any body shape...however material is very light and it will not maintain nice appearance through very many wash cycles.,37789,2
37790,"This dress is way too short, the underliner that is, and too big on the waist.",37790,2
37790,"I'm taking it to get altered or not moving in it, definitely not bending over",37790,2
37791,loved the product but it was soooo tiny for my big butt couldn't even get them on :(,37791,2
37792,did not fit,37792,2
37793,If you are busty it will look different from the picture.,37793,2
37793,"My bust area sucks up the front of the blouse, so it didn't look like the picture.. love the color thou.",37793,2
37794,"Cute top, but it flared out to much at the bottom",37794,2

37796,Very cheap.,37796,2
37796,Returned.,37796,2
37797,It's way too small suitable for a kid.,37797,2
37798,eh.,37798,2
37798,"returned it, fit funny",37798,2
37799,"The dress is beautiful, however it runs very, very small....",37799,2
37799,"I had read the reviews and seen that it does run small so I ordered an XXL, whereas normally I wear an XL and sometimes need an XXL as I have a very large chest (38/40 DD)...",37799,2
37799,The XXL was very tight in the chest area and arms.,37799,2
37799,"I returned and ordered the XXXL which was barely bigger.... it's still very pretty, but you can tell they cheaped out on the fabric across the upper chest connecting to the arms as that area is especially snug, through the neck line in the back.",37799,2
37799,"Honestly not sure I'd recommend... it's definitely a dress you want, but not sure if you will wear based on the comfort of it.",37799,2
37799,I'm keeping it figuring I have a few weeks to see if I wear it and if not I will be returning.,37799,2
37799,It's too bad that to save a few dollars they don't give a little more room in the arms/chest...,37799,2
37800,Awkward yellow.,37800,2
37800,hard to get used to,37800,2
37801,Extremely poor quality.,37801,2
37801,"Upon trying the top on, it broke immediately.",37801,2
37801,I tried to tie the bottom strings and one of the ties broke right off.,37801,2
37801,It happened again with the top ties.,37801,2
37801,"Without ever getting the chance to wear it two ties had broken off, from the four.",37801,2
37801,I contacted the seller about this but never got a response.,37801,2
37801,Very poor customer service.,37801,2
37801,"In the end I ended up sewing everything back on, but I'm afraid other parts may break and suddenly I will be exposed.",37801,2
37801,"Looks cute on, but not sure it is worth it when things easily break.",37801,2
37802,The front is loose but everywhere else fits,37802,2
37803,Not what I expected.,37803,2
37803,The trimmer looks larger on the picture.,37803,2
37804,You have to have an awesome big boob and perfect curves body to fit this swim suit beautiful.,37804,2
37804,I wear a size four and doesn't fit as well and I consider myself average body figure.,37804,2
37804,Material is not well made but I guess can't ask for much base on price.,37804,2
37805,"Very short inseam, fabric is cheap and see thru.",37805,2
37806,Poorly made.,37806,2
37806,The pads are unusable and are white and you can see them through the top fabric.,37806,2
37806,The inner and outer layers have different shapes so that it does not lay quite eight.,37806,2
37806,Might be ok just to show the strappy back under another top.,37806,2
37806,No way could wear alone especially if you have any type of chest that needs support.,37806,2
37806,Sadly disappointed since I wanted something with cute back straps to wear with other tops.,37806,2
37807,This suit would be perfect if it didn't have a built in bra and too much padding.,37807,2
37807,I wear 36f/ddd and it smashes my boobs.,37807,2
37807,You can't tell they are smashed the materialistic great sizing exact to the chart.,37807,2
37808,This was poorly made.,37808,2
37808,The size I purchased was the correct size & the bottom half fit correctly but the top was way too loose & it was revealing & low cut.,37808,2
37809,I was not expecting the material to be so thin.,37809,2
37810,"Cheap material, see through!",37810,2
37811,I bought an XL and still was snug.,37811,2
37811,I usually wear Med to Lg...matters on the cut.,37811,2
37812,"At first, I loved this backpack.",37812,2
37812,"It's a good size and I like that it has a full zip, so nothing will fall out.",37812,2
37812,"BUT, within a couple of months, the black dye started to rub off.",37812,2
37812,"By a few months after that, it had rubbed off to the point that quite a lot of the bag was light grey.",37812,2
37812,It was very unsightly and I finally had to get rid of it.,37812,2
37812,"What was supposed to be a smart, useful bag turned out to be badly made and was trashed within a few short months.",37812,2
37813,I can't believe this broke.,37813,2
37813,I shouldn't.,37813,2
37813,Considering how inexpensive this was.,37813,2
37813,"But, I was very disappointed.",37813,2
37813,"However, it's beautiful.",37813,2
37813,I am ordering another one.,37813,2
37813,"But, it's construction is very poor.",37813,2
37814,too small.,37814,2
37814,The waist is for 5 months old baby.,37814,2
37814,"I bought 12 months, (my baby is 8 months old) and runs small.",37814,2
37814,He is a normal size baby.,37814,2
37815,"I ordered this because I loved the combination of colors, however, the rhinestones on this necklace is very large and gaudy.",37815,2
37815,"The circumference of the necklace is at the same time, too small.",37815,2
37815,"The chain on the back will allow you to possibly expand the chain to wear the necklace, but then it will not lay down flat.",37815,2
37815,"I ordered this for me, but once I saw it in person, it looked only good enough as dress up play jewelry so I gave it to my preschooler.",37815,2
37816,"The positives:
-Fits pretty true to size.",37816,2
37816,"It is maybe slightly small, it is a little short.",37816,2
37816,But otherwise it fits well.,37816,2
37816,"For reference I am just under 5'4"", 114lbs, athletic build.",37816,2
37816,"-Has a snap on the V neck so it doesn't open too much
-Beautiful pattern (I bought the blue floral)

The negatives:
-Extremely cheap fabric.",37816,2
37816,"It is thin and cheap feeling, like paper almost.",37816,2
37816,-It smells pretty bad.,37816,2
37816,I had to take it off quickly it was actually making me feel a little sick.,37816,2
37816,"This may be remedied by washing, but as the fabric is so gross and cheap I am returning it.",37816,2
37816,"I think this would be fine if you wanted something you're only going to wear once for pictures or something, as it is really cute and fits well.",37816,2
37816,"However, the fabric is so bad I just cannot see myself wearing it.",37816,2
37816,A huge bummer!,37816,2
37817,Wore it one time and the zipper broke by the end of the night.,37817,2
37817,Not a happy camper!,37817,2
37818,I wasn't so happy with this because the one I liked most was broken and was packaged to me which I feel wasn't right to do to a customer!!!,37818,2
37818,!,37818,2
37819,DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPLY MADE.BUT WHAT DID I EXPECT FOR THE PRICE.,37819,2
37819,DO NOT RECCOMMAND IT.,37819,2
37819,SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.,37819,2
37819,BUT I DID KEEP IT.,37819,2
37819,NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE TO RETURN IT.,37819,2
37820,Nice look but order at least 2 sizes up.,37820,2
37820,Also itchy seams.,37820,2
37821,The notch that I'm currently using is starting to tear.. Had to move it to a tighter notch and am probably throwing it away soon.,37821,2
37821,Lasted 6months I think,37821,2
37822,Cheap!,37822,2
37822,They fit really small and I have a tiny head as it is.,37822,2
37822,I get head aches from them.,37822,2
37822,I ended up giving them to the kids to play with.,37822,2
37822,Not recommended.,37822,2
37823,I bought XL and they are TOO SMALL.,37823,2
37823,"I am 5'5"" and weigh 135 lbs.",37823,2
37823,"XL should have been on the big side, which is what I was going for since I have three children and am working on my figure.",37823,2
37823,I couldn't believe that these were too short.,37823,2
37823,"They also don't fit like a compression tank should, there's no hugging in the right places...just a loosely form fitted shape to the shirt.",37823,2
37823,Boo hiss.,37823,2
37824,It looks very nice and feels like a good quality watch.,37824,2
37824,But it wasn't for me.,37824,2
37824,"Judging by the fact that there was no place for a battery in the back and all I saw were watch gears instead, I gathered it was a wind-up watch.",37824,2
37824,I could not find in the directions any way to wind it up.,37824,2
37824,"Apparently the main twisting piece on the side has three ""settings"" which are very hard to distinguish between and one of them may have been the one to wind the watch.",37824,2
37824,I could never tell if it was working or not.,37824,2
37824,"The other on the same side are, in my opinion, badly placed on the watch.",37824,2
37824,"I work with my hands and my wrists get bumped a lot and, as a result, so does my watch.",37824,2
37824,These buttons were pushed a lot accidentally while at work which was very inconvenient.,37824,2
37824,"Also, while at work, an especially large bump to my watch CAUSED THE GLASS PIECE COVERING THE FACE OF THE WATCH TO FALL OFF.",37824,2
37824,I would have lost the piece if I hadn't heard it hit the ground.,37824,2
37825,Really wanted to love these but they arrived with a scratch in the lens which took away some of the mirror tint and they aren't real wood just plastic wood grain wrap...also they broke.,37825,2
37826,Got a lot of duplicates in my order.,37826,2
37826,Decent quality for the actual studs though.,37826,2
37827,"Too Small, colors are not like in the picture...",37827,2
37828,"It's a very pretty suit, but it didn't fit me.",37828,2
37828,I chose based on the measurements guide.,37828,2
37828,"In order to be large enough in the chest, the leg holes and butt were huge.",37828,2
37828,I have to return it.,37828,2
37829,Love the dress but don't bother unless you are 90 lbs.,37829,2
37829,and 5.2.,37829,2
37829,I wear a 2 in designer clothes and the Large was too small.,37829,2
37830,This product was smaller than I expected it to be.,37830,2
37830,Also the ring was missing the jewel that was supposed to be there.,37830,2
37830,"I would not recommend this to people, sorry.",37830,2
37831,I ordered the shirt because it looked so cute in the picture.,37831,2
37831,It is!!!!,37831,2
37831,It is very pretty in person as well.,37831,2
37831,I normally wear a small or medium.,37831,2
37831,(Depending on the style of the shirt) I have 34DD breast.,37831,2
37831,I ordered the size 6.,37831,2
37831,It is the size it is suppose to be.,37831,2
37831,"However, for my particular body type it did not fit well.",37831,2
37831,It is not for someone who has large breast.,37831,2
37831,This style of shirt is for someone with very small breast.,37831,2
37831,It does not suit large breast.,37831,2
37831,"It is for someone who is a bit on the thinner side, with small breast.",37831,2
37831,I'd say that it will only look good on someone with the body type of the model in the pic.,37831,2
37831,"If you have that body, like in the model, most definitely get it.",37831,2
37831,"Or if you are a large or a medium, but with small breast get it.",37831,2
37831,"But, if you have large breast do not get it.",37831,2
37831,It does not flatter big breast.,37831,2
37831,"I'll keep the shirt, because it is so cute, but I will wear a blazer over it, or a coat over it.",37831,2
37831,It is true to size.,37831,2
37831,Good luck!,37831,2
37831,:),37831,2
37832,"Disappointed...my size a US 8 measurements are: bust 34, waist 29, hip 39.",37832,2
37832,"At my thighs together I'm 34"" (I know total pair shape) I ordered a medium and the bottoms won't fit over my knees!!!",37832,2
37832,"Measuring the bottoms at the TOP BAND without stretching is 22"".",37832,2
37832,"Full extension of stretch is 30"" at the hip/ butt fully extended is 39"" these measurements are all before the cracking of the stitches.",37832,2
37832,Before I submit to return I'm going to see if my size 6 daughter wants it.,37832,2
37832,Good quality Love the top!!!,37832,2
37832,Fast shipping!,37832,2
37833,The arm holes are kinda awkward like way to large for the dress.,37833,2
37833,I am going to have to figure a way to take them in or close them up!,37833,2
37833,The pink is more on the peachy side then pink.,37833,2
37833,Only got to wear it 1 time and 2 out of 3 buttons came off.,37833,2
37834,Not at all what I expected.,37834,2
37834,The gold on the buckles looked cheap and the material on the bag was not as described.,37834,2
37834,Returned.,37834,2
37835,"First, I must say that this is a beautiful coat, the price is very reasonable, and the quality of this coat is very good.",37835,2
37835,"Unfortunately, for me the coat was not even close to being my size.",37835,2
37835,I would guess that an average size person might want to get two sizes beyond their normal size.,37835,2
37835,I really wish that this coat would have fitted.,37835,2
37835,A quality item!,37835,2
37836,Way to big will return,37836,2
37837,"Too large, I couldn't use it had to return bit.",37837,2
37837,Needed it for a special occasion and didn't have time to order another one....,37837,2
37838,"The skirt is really nice, but the top is cheaply made and very tiny.",37838,2
37839,don' like,37839,2
37840,Outfit fits much smaller than the size.,37840,2
37840,"Also, the logo and finish are unlikely to withstand more than a few washings.",37840,2
37840,Reminds me of cheap T shirt logos.,37840,2
37841,"This top is beautiful, but the neckline does not lay flat.",37841,2
37841,"I'll be returning it, but I suppose you could use fashion tape to keep it in place.",37841,2
37842,I like the shirt but it is just a little tight.,37842,2
37842,"Hopefully,  it will fit when I lose more weight",37842,2
37843,"I ordered my size but the leggings did not fit me, so i ordered one size larger and they were too tight.",37843,2
37843,It smelled weird as well..I did not wash them so i do not know if the smell will go away by doing so.,37843,2
37843,"The material and color are pretty , the cut is simple but good enough for the price.",37843,2
37844,hardly fit over breast,37844,2
37845,Cute but way too big for my face,37845,2
37846,"I liked the concept fine, however, the neck was way too large and hung off the shoulders.",37846,2
37846,I returned it.,37846,2
37847,"very see through and thin, and about two sizes to small .",37847,2
37847,it is not really the size it says,37847,2
37848,"It's comfortable but it helps flatten your rolls, but doesn't help a ALL to lift butt.",37848,2
37848,I'm disappointed cause the only reason I order this was to shape and lift booty.,37848,2
37848,Don't buy this if your hoping for a butt lift.,37848,2
37849,They gave me four shirts with different sizes.,37849,2
37849,"I won't bother returning it, I will just give it to my sisters.",37849,2
37849,smh,37849,2
37850,"So, I bought this a few days ago, so awesome quick delivery, but I received the wrong product.",37850,2
37850,"Instead of Gladriel's necklace, I received this heart of the ocean necklace.",37850,2
37850,"Cool, but not want I wanted.....",37850,2
37851,This would be a GREAT costume if only it would actually inflate and stay up.,37851,2
37851,The design causes it to leak everywhere.,37851,2
37851,Very poor design.,37851,2
37851,Not seller's fault but that of the company that made it.,37851,2
37852,So I bought these glasses thinking they were a steal!,37852,2
37852,I mean finding sunglasses anywhere for a $10 price point is amazing already.,37852,2
37852,Not to mention that they are polarized?!,37852,2
37852,I was so excited to get some decent sunglasses finally...,37852,2
37852,"Upon opening the packaging, I was already a little off-put by the small size of the glasses (it can probably be attributed to them being unisex).",37852,2
37852,"After putting them on though, that's the real kicker.",37852,2
37852,"They immediately gave me the feeling of dizziness similar to that of drunk goggles, if you have ever shared that experience.",37852,2
37852,Walking outside was a whole new ball game.,37852,2
37852,"The glare coming off of other vehicles was magnified, not reduced like polarized sunglasses are meant to be.",37852,2
37852,"Instead, when looking at the glare directly, one of the lenses would perform perfectly, cancelling out all glare to the point that I could see into the backseat of a car with tinted windows.",37852,2
37852,"Yet on the other hand, or rather lens, it magnified the glare!",37852,2
37852,"It was like watching a 3-D movie out of the 2000's with the little paper glasses they would provide, but somehow the 3-D glasses didn't work as well and everything looked like it was in focus and out of focus at the same time while throwing depth perception out the window.",37852,2
37852,"I am not sure if I received a poor or defective product, but these are going back as soon as I print the label out.",37852,2
37852,"These glasses may have panned out well if not for the so called ""polarization"" they put on them.",37852,2
37852,"Next time I look for a cheap pair of sunglasses, I'll avoid the polarized ones.",37852,2
37853,"First, I would like to give kudos because the shipping time was great.",37853,2
37853,However the dress is not at all what I expected.,37853,2
37853,"I usually wear a medium, but per the size chart I ordered a large, ugh it's too big!",37853,2
37853,Order your normal size ladies.,37853,2
37853,"It feels like cheap jersey material, not that nice blend most bodycon dresses are made of.",37853,2
37853,"I have no clue what I'm going to do with it, shipping it back is more than the dress.",37853,2
37853,"Oh well-you win some, you lose some.",37853,2
37854,Looks very cheap.,37854,2
37854,Loose threads hanging all over.,37854,2
37854,Would not recommend.,37854,2
37855,Fit was not flattering for me.,37855,2
37855,I'm Apple shaped (5'6 - 155 lbs).,37855,2
37855,The quality was cheap and it smelled a little funny.,37855,2
37855,Price is low so it was somewhat expected.,37855,2
37856,Too bulky and not thin enough for dress shoes.,37856,2
37857,"It stretched within the first time wearing it, and stopped becoming keeping things in place after using it for one heated yoga session with minimal arm and shoulder movement.",37857,2
37857,"Not really impressed with it, but its super cute!",37857,2
37857,I'll likely be using it now under lounge wear at home under a loose t shirt or something.,37857,2
37857,Wish it was more durable and supportive!,37857,2
37858,The skirt was too small- should've ordered a size bigger,37858,2
37859,Cut a littler to small in the chest area but OK for petite person cut.,37859,2
37860,To small for my glasses,37860,2
37861,"I bought this because it came up under ""concealed carry purse"" but it's just a purse.",37861,2
37861,Don't be fooled like me.,37861,2
37862,Darn it!!,37862,2
37862,I felt like this had potential!!,37862,2
37862,"First off it's way more orange that I thought, also I got a xxl and it was small on me.",37862,2
37862,And the built in cup mAkes it even smaller for the girls.,37862,2
37862,"Oh and let's not forget the best part, right when I took it out of the bad and held up, I stretched it to see how much give it had (not even close to hard) and one of the straps broke.",37862,2
37862,Very sad.,37862,2
37862,Will return asap,37862,2
37863,Looked ok but made my nose super itchy and red.,37863,2
37863,I've had my nose pierced for a few years.,37863,2
37863,So must be cheap metal,37863,2
37864,The calf was way small for me I didn't like that at all had to give them away.,37864,2
37864,I ordered a size 9,37864,2
37865,These were somewhat sturdy bags.,37865,2
37865,I ordered them as gifts for girl friends but I received the wrong size.,37865,2
37865,"Overall, they were well packaged and seemed of decent quality.",37865,2
37865,"However, I returned them so I cannot speak to how well they function",37865,2
37866,too small,37866,2
37867,The necklace is very cute but the color changes quickly after a few days and leaves a line around your neck,37867,2
37868,It rived too small and wrong color.,37868,2
37868,It`s not looking the same like on the web.,37868,2
37868,Little disappointing but I ordered another one just to try to get the right size and color.,37868,2
37868,Lets see :(,37868,2
37869,the waist and lower part of this dress did not fit my girlfriend.,37869,2
37869,She has a regular portioned body and the but part is not flexible at all and when she walked it would work its way up her back.,37869,2
37870,Bought this for my son looks good just a little small,37870,2
37871,Looks cheap,37871,2
37872,"It was not knee length but the same size as the ""skater skirts""!",37872,2
37872,Not sure if this was a fluke but be careful sizing,37872,2
37873,Product runs very small stay cautious when purchasing,37873,2
37874,it look like easy to break,37874,2
37875,"Nice shirt, but we did not expect it to be so large.",37875,2
37876,Material is very light and you can see thru it.,37876,2
37876,Will need to wear something underneath.,37876,2
37877,the lace is nice but poorly made uneven the lace on the neck area and too short on the body area.,37877,2
37878,"I don't like the material, because it's hot and sticky, on warm/hot day, however, the colors and pattern are pretty.",37878,2
37879,Big,37879,2
37880,Great color and style.,37880,2
37880,There was a seam across the rear that makes this underwear a little uncomfortable.,37880,2
37881,cheap material,37881,2
37882,"Way too small and tight, even though I ordered a size up.",37882,2
37882,"I'd give it to my niece, but the words aren't appropriate.",37882,2
37883,These pieces arrived broken.,37883,2
37883,Both pieces has stones unattached.,37883,2
37883,Both pieces were of much lower quality than I anticipated.,37883,2
37883,Very disappointed.,37883,2
37884,Cute but cheap material.,37884,2
37884,Returned ASAP,37884,2
37885,Not what I was expecting at all.,37885,2
37885,Was very short in length and somewhat tight in the best area.,37885,2
37885,I wear a 40 DD and can usually wear an XL in tank tops.,37885,2
37885,It bearly let's me tuck it into my pants to use as an undershirt.,37885,2
37886,I think this shirt is absolutely adorable!,37886,2
37886,I ordered it and it was very light and wasn't as I expected.,37886,2
37886,"I ordered an xl, and it wasn't at all an xl, it fit like a medium.",37886,2
37886,It runs very very small.,37886,2
37886,"I was so disappointed, I was looking forward to wearing it.",37886,2
37887,feels cheap,37887,2
37888,Very cheap.,37888,2
37888,you get what you pay for.,37888,2
37888,They are very very light weight.,37888,2
37888,"Not for cold weather, these are just for fashion.",37888,2
37888,Cool for the springtime.,37888,2
37889,the printing was off the tag,37889,2
37890,These fit odd to me.,37890,2
37890,"The toes are a little on the long side even for my long toes, was to tight on my big toe and fit oddly on the foot.",37890,2
37890,They didn't fit like I would expect a yoga sock would or any sock for that matter.,37890,2
37891,I was super excited to get this in and get the American flag onesie but when it arrived and I opened the package their was an immediate odor and the colors weren't bright at all they were very faded but I thought eh it looks a little vintage so I rushed to wash it (made sure it was cold water) so I could try it on and when I took it out of the washer the colors had faded even more making the red a slight pink and barely noticeable and the navy a royal blue.,37891,2
37891,Very disappointed with the outcome of the colors but I will give it two stars only because it had pockets.,37891,2
37892,I wear a size 8 in pants and medium in skirts and these are very tight on my thighs at the top.,37892,2
37892,The lace will roll and does not display well at all.,37892,2
37893,Just a little too big.,37893,2
37894,The straps on the arms will not stay put like the picture.,37894,2
37894,There is a big gap from the first shoulder strap to the next.,37894,2
37894,Very disappointed with this shirt.,37894,2
37894,Looked so cute in the pucture.,37894,2
37895,"I went by the size chart and ordered a large, which is my normal size.",37895,2
37895,"When I put it on, I was very disappointed, it was WAY too tight.",37895,2
37895,"If you order this, order 1-2 sizes larger!",37895,2
37895,!,37895,2
37896,these are pretty terrible.,37896,2
37896,I guess I got my moneys worth (which wasn't a lot).,37896,2
37896,Can see sweat marks.,37896,2
37897,These never worked because they always slip off.,37897,2
37897,Nice concept but  in reality just don't stay put.,37897,2
37898,The mask arrived with the drawstring already broken.,37898,2
37898,"We got two of these, and one has seemed to be fine, but the other wasn't.",37898,2
37898,Suggests rather shoddy craftsmanship.,37898,2
37899,Very hard to read the time in daylight.,37899,2
37899,Not one of my best buys.,37899,2
37900,The ring itself is fine - for a young girl or for a pinkie finger.,37900,2
37900,But it was so much smaller than what I was expecting.,37900,2
37900,I will end up giving this one away.,37900,2
37901,I give away,37901,2
37902,The alien look good but the you can see where it was stitched on because the stitches were an abvious white and you can see it was stitched on poorly.,37902,2
37902,The shirt has a nice quality but I got a medium and it fits really tight and it's a belly shirt.,37902,2
37902,They should have said its a belly shirt.,37902,2
37902,So ladies if your a bit busty or have a little gut... Get large.,37902,2
37903,Didn't fit as expected....,37903,2
37904,"pin was bent on arrival, was able to straighten to some degree - unclear how usable it may be.",37904,2
37904,"The pin is not replaceable and if damaged, the whole unit is throw-away - inexpensive, but I prefer things that are repairable.",37904,2
37905,Not for me.,37905,2
37905,Looks more for someone in their twenties.,37905,2
37906,really cute.,37906,2
37906,broke on second wearing.,37906,2
37906,You get what you pay for.,37906,2
37907,To small size not worth for + 100$,37907,2
37908,Wayyyyyy to small!,37908,2
37908,!,37908,2
37909,Very thin material.,37909,2
37909,May not last through many washings.,37909,2
37910,There was no paper work or anything with the product.,37910,2
37910,It is not what I thought it would be and I am very disappointed.,37910,2
37911,"Pretty, but not sized accordingly.",37911,2
37912,This shirt looked and felt like baby doll pajama's.,37912,2
37912,It was way big.,37912,2
37912,Based on reviews I bought and XL.,37912,2
37912,I wear a medium (USA).,37912,2
37912,"I should have purchased a large, it would have been fine.",37912,2
37912,But I still did not like the pajama look of this top.,37912,2
37912,The photo makes it look a lot cuter.,37912,2
37912,"I wear a size 10 top, I have a 34DD bra size and I have middle age dunlap disease.",37912,2
37913,Brim always flopped in my baby's face.,37913,2
37913,She did not like wearing it.,37913,2
37914,It looks great before you buy it.,37914,2
37914,But the sizing is way off.,37914,2
37914,"I knew that I needed to buy one a few sizes bigger based on the reviews, and I did, but was still snug.",37914,2
37914,The front panel is extremely sheer and you can see through it.,37914,2
37914,"The reason I get a suit that is not a bikini is because I don't like to show my stomach, which this suit does.",37914,2
37915,This is too small in some areas and too large in others.,37915,2
37915,The cups on the bra part are gigantic and unflattering.,37915,2
37915,"I wear a 36C, so my boobs are not small, but the cups are way too large.",37915,2
37915,"Unless you have DD, they will probably be too big.",37915,2
37915,The cap portion is also ill-fitting.,37915,2
37915,"The neck is too tight and too high, and there is this weird gap between the bottom of the part that goes across your chest and the cups from the leotard part.",37915,2
37915,"In the picture, it looks like they touch, but they don't, and instead a very unflattering side boob muffin hangs out, being pushed up from the leotard and pushed down by the cape.",37915,2
37915,Not cute.,37915,2
37915,I gave it 2 stars because it may be flattering on someone much smaller than me.,37915,2
37915,"I wear a size 12, and I wouldn't recommend buying unless you are size 6 or smaller.",37915,2
37916,Very disappointed due to the workmanship!,37916,2
37916,It can't be that hard to get the placement of the snap correct.,37916,2
37916,That one flaw made this keychain go from a beautiful piece of leather to a piece of crap.,37916,2
37916,I was embarrassed to give this as a gift.,37916,2
37917,The material is not of good quality,37917,2
37918,"The silver gray runs small :( I have black, navy blue, royal blue and they all fit fine.",37918,2
37918,Just the silver gray is too tight.,37918,2
37918,Super disappointed because the color is great.,37918,2
37919,Came from China....size is way off.,37919,2
37920,"Look nice, but uncomfortable.",37920,2
37920,Narrow.,37920,2
37921,Not what I expected.,37921,2
37921,Cheap!,37921,2
37921,Unraveled before I even washed it.,37921,2
37921,Wore it one time.,37921,2
37922,Does not,37922,2
37923,This is my first review for a dress on amazon and I'am afraid it is not going to be good.,37923,2
37923,I received the product early but when I first saw it I thought this was not the dress I had ordered as color is too different.,37923,2
37923,The color is extremely dull as though I have used for many years and it was totally different from the picture.,37923,2
37923,"When I opened it,the fabric is pathetic,worst.",37923,2
37923,The dress looked cheap because of fabric.,37923,2
37923,I did not like it at all.,37923,2
37923,The only good thing is the cute belt I got with it.,37923,2
37923,I can bet that I'am not going to wear this dress even once but started using the belt for other short dresses I have.,37923,2
37924,"Purchased in April and shoes are worn maybe 1-2x/week, mainly indoors.",37924,2
37924,They're already falling apart.,37924,2
37924,I'm,37924,2
37925,Poor quality tshirt and becomes way too expensive for it's worth especially after shipping costs,37925,2
37926,I don't like the material.,37926,2
37927,Way too small,37927,2
37928,Wig was WAY too small for my head.,37928,2
37929,I normally wear a 1X.,37929,2
37929,I ordered a 3X based on other reviews.,37929,2
37929,"It was still too small, especially at the bottom.",37929,2
37929,I also have a fairly short torso and it still hit me between my natural waist and hips.,37929,2
37929,"The quality seems good and the color is nice, maybe a little darker than the picture.",37929,2
37929,"Unfortunately, I am going to have to return it.",37929,2
37930,Charger piece took a chunk of meat out of my son's ankle.,37930,2
37930,LED lights only work a few times.,37930,2
37931,"I'm 5'3'' 106lbs, the leggins were a bit loose.",37931,2
37931,It's not as nicely cut as the picture.,37931,2
37931,Feels cheap.,37931,2
37932,"I was warned, as I read the reviews, that this purse was a lighter gray than shown, but, WOW, this was not just a variation in the color, in person it's almost white.",37932,2
37932,Very pale gray and doesn't go with either of the shoes or boots I got it to go with.,37932,2
37932,Nor any gray clothes I have.,37932,2
37932,"I was going to keep it and perhaps give it away but I looked at it again yesterday and saw something, a scratch I guess all the way across the front.",37932,2
37932,"Very faint but it's a bit shiny against the matte fabric, so I'm in the process of returning it.",37932,2
37933,"The bracelet holds the hairtie well but once you take off the hairtie, there's nothing to hold the bracelet on!",37933,2
37933,It just falls right off the wrist.,37933,2
37933,Defeats the purpose.,37933,2
37933,It needs a clasp or something.,37933,2
37933,Hopefully I can find a friend with larger wrists that can get some use out of these.,37933,2
37933,"The idea is great but if you have small wrists, don't bother.",37933,2
37934,"This was nice for the first few times I used it, then it broke.",37934,2
37935,Cheaply made you get what you paid for.,37935,2
37936,All this cheap jewelry made in China is crappy.,37936,2
37936,Wish I'd have known it before I bought so much of it.,37936,2
37937,Does not provide the support I find in other tankini's...,37937,2
37937,Very low cut and not enough coverage on top.,37937,2
37937,I will continue my search for a better fit.,37937,2
37938,"This is definitely adorable, but it's not a swimsuit & shouldn't be advertised as such.",37938,2
37938,ETA: falling apart after a week of swimming with it.,37938,2
37938,"Tail has a hole, on the top the stitching is coming loose around one of the straps.",37938,2
37938,Such a disappointment.,37938,2
37938,Only reason I'm giving it 2 starts is because my daughter still loves it despite its flaws.,37938,2
37939,Size fits but soooooo nowhere near the color that i had ordered...doesnt look like it did in the picture and material is super thin,37939,2
37940,This shirt is VERY see through.,37940,2
37940,I returned it the day day I got it.,37940,2
37940,I don't feel it is flattering,37940,2
37941,"Very cute, but too short.",37941,2
37941,"I am 5'8"", so I know I am on the taller side... but this didn't even cover my butt.",37941,2
37941,Looks like a long shirt.,37941,2
37942,The collar was super stretched out.,37942,2
37942,Wasn't at all what we were expecting.,37942,2
37942,!,37942,2
37943,For a medium the arm holes were very small,37943,2
37944,Not on time with shipment and too small.,37944,2
37945,Sizes are smaller than sized in US sizes,37945,2
37946,"Collar very wide, short sleeves, fabric is not good",37946,2
37947,the bottom hem is uneven and all the edges are frayed.,37947,2
37947,it looks especially bad around the waist area where the pink fabric has long frays.,37947,2
37947,poorly made product.,37947,2
37948,The chino fit is different know I don't like the new style,37948,2
37949,Wow.,37949,2
37949,This is way too big.,37949,2
37949,I can't believe it was a size small.,37949,2
37949,"I don't see any label that identifies as a ""small"".",37949,2
37949,I ordered two shirts from this company and both were 1-2 sizes too big on me.,37949,2
37950,"It was not this color, it was more of a chocolate brown.",37950,2
37950,"Also, the sweater was starting to fall apart, there was some sort of snag when I received it and it looks like a hole in that place now.",37950,2
37951,Cute shirt .. material is very thin!!,37951,2
37951,And not true to size,37951,2
37952,"Poorly made, thin non-denim material.",37952,2
37952,Would not recommend.,37952,2
37953,Chain keeps breaking,37953,2
37954,Didn't really have the bottom strap- was not as expected-  much smaller more bra like than crop top,37954,2
37955,Cheap material.,37955,2
37955,Weird smell,37955,2
37956,"did not like it,, it didn't have much grip",37956,2
37957,The clasps on these suspenders are very flimsy and break very easily.,37957,2
37958,Sadly these have to be returned.,37958,2
37958,"I prefer a waist that fits up higher, and though these appear to they seem to fit too low (not enough rise).",37958,2
37958,"I liked the color and fabric, so wished they'd fit better.",37958,2
37959,"My leggings arrived quickly, and looked and fit as described.",37959,2
37959,"However, I wore them, gently, twice and already have multiple holes and frays in them.",37959,2
37959,Not at all impressed with the quality of the product.,37959,2
37959,Two stars for the packaging and quick delivery.,37959,2
37960,Pretty ring but have only wore it a month and the stones are falling out.,37960,2
37961,The product is much smaller than it appears.,37961,2
37961,The shoe polish containers are miniature so that it makes everything else appear larger...for those who know the size of normal shoe polish containers.,37961,2
37961,I was disappointed by the size.,37961,2
37961,The quality seems fine.,37961,2
37962,"The ring is styled nicely, except the the add was misleading.",37962,2
37962,The ring was advertised as stainless steel.,37962,2
37962,This ring is actually brass with a gold plating.,37962,2
37962,The plating will eventually wear off.,37962,2
37962,I will not ever wear the ring.,37962,2
37963,This was totally unflattering on me.,37963,2
37963,"Too snug on hips, and I guess I'm not a bat wing sorta gal.",37963,2
37963,"So disappointed because it's well made, though somewhat sheer.",37963,2
37963,Will give it away.,37963,2
37964,Way too small from normal shirt fit.,37964,2
37964,Order at least 1 or 2 sizes larger than needed.,37964,2
37964,Material is very scratchy and just a cheap shirt.,37964,2
37964,Won't but another shirt from this company.,37964,2
37965,After about a year the paint started to fall off of the frames and arms.,37965,2
37965,"Good glasses, lousy finish.",37965,2
37966,Cheap material,37966,2
37967,I have this exact same shirt that I bought from JCPenney 3 years ago.,37967,2
37967,Sadly I got a large ink stain on it so I was excited when I found out I could get a new one from Amazon.,37967,2
37967,The drop in quality is laughable.,37967,2
37967,My 3 yr old version is constructed so so much better.,37967,2
37967,It's honestly twice the thickness of the new one I received.,37967,2
37967,That being said the fit is still the same and it's wrinkle resistant but geez.,37967,2
37967,Not great Dockers.,37967,2
37967,Not great.,37967,2
37968,It's totally see thru and fits really tight.,37968,2
37969,"awkward fit, I am 4'11"" and 120 lbs I ordered a medium because it was the smallest size and other reviewers said to get one size larger than you normally wear.",37969,2
37969,The length was fine but it is very wide.,37969,2
37969,Medium in circumference but a small in length.,37969,2
37969,"I ordered a Jackson shirt but received Mark instead, which was disappointing.",37969,2
37970,Ordered this in size 7/8 for my girl who normally wears a size 5/6 based on reviews that it runs small.,37970,2
37970,"After one wash, it's VERY SNUG on her!",37970,2
37970,Was expecting this to last at least a year and a half or 2.,37970,2
37970,Doesn't look like it!,37970,2
37970,Also the colors are not as bright as shown on the computer,37970,2
37971,Got what you pay for.,37971,2
37971,Broke after one day of wearing.,37971,2
37971,not to mention.,37971,2
37971,how incredibly hard it is to out on by yourself,37971,2
37972,The fit the color is perfect but I had questions that where not answered right I got offered 10 dollars for a dress that was not made to what was in the discretion i got 20 back I don't think is enough to pay for the alteration but I couldn't get threw to them.,37972,2
37972,I will never but from here or recommend anyone to it unless you can afford to get your dress fixed but I can't.,37972,2
37973,Fits just like a tight skull cap: there no room for any hair.,37973,2
37974,The paint and plastic were scratched and chipped.,37974,2
37974,They were not in new condition.,37974,2
37975,I purchased this as I liked the design and could not find the black frames with wood on sale and I liked them for the first few weeks.,37975,2
37975,"However, barely a month of using them a few days here and there and the glue that holds the metal around the temple is becoming incredibly loose on both sides.",37975,2
37975,My return period is over so there's not much I can do now.,37975,2
37975,"Just be aware of this issue, and can not recommend.",37975,2
37975,:(,37975,2
37976,"I will say that I LOVE the look of this dress, the lace is very nice.",37976,2
37976,However when I tried wearing it I couldn't stand the feel of the inner lining.,37976,2
37976,"It may be that I have sensitive skin but I couldn't stop itching, the material was so scratchy!",37976,2
37976,Not only was it scratchy but the arms were so tight that I couldn't really life my arms.,37976,2
37976,When I ordered this dress it ONLY came in small which I didn't think would be a problem because I generally wear small but this was pushing it even for me.,37976,2
37977,Looks nothing like this,37977,2
37978,The skirt was perfect the top is for someone who is an A cup.,37978,2
37978,Even in a XL the top was for small chest people.,37978,2
37979,The way the shoulders are cut on this cause it to rise up and show seams not meant to be seen.,37979,2
37979,Not very practical.,37979,2
37979,Fit slightly loose over all.,37979,2
37980,Would be so cute if it didn't run WAY WAY small.,37980,2
37980,"I normally wear a medium to large, this was the biggest size and it was TINY.",37980,2
37981,"does not cover my butt, waist ok.",37981,2
37982,"Nowhere near as long as it looks in the picture, but the fabric and color are nice.",37982,2
37983,Cheap.,37983,2
37983,Ugly.,37983,2
37983,Looks nothing like images online.,37983,2
37984,The item looks great but runs very small,37984,2
37985,I did not receive the red sheath for the long thin silver bladed sword.,37985,2
37986,The top is great for all sizes.,37986,2
37986,If you have small boobs than you might have problem.,37986,2
37986,If you have a large bottom like me the bottom was to small and I ordered a size bigger for that reason.,37986,2
37987,"Came with a hole in it, did not notice until someone showed it to me .",37987,2
37988,these looked really cheap in person.,37988,2
37988,I returned them.,37988,2
37989,"Very thin, and too tight.",37989,2
37989,I ordered an XL and am in my3rd trimester.,37989,2
37990,Too small.,37990,2
37990,"very much so, please inform me instructions for returning them.",37990,2
37990,Thanks,37990,2
37991,really stiff and rough.,37991,2
37991,fit extremely tight in the bust and i ordered 2 sizes bigger then what the size chart said I needed.,37991,2
37991,If it had fir properly it would have worked out for what I needed.,37991,2
37992,This back pack looks amazing.,37992,2
37992,However...the one seam is coming apart after a couple of weeks of light use.,37992,2
37992,The type of material the lining is made out of has to be rolled under before it is sewn.,37992,2
37992,"It was not, so the material is fraying and the seam is coming apart.",37992,2
37992,My son loves it...I am disappointed.,37992,2
37993,"Buy 2 t-shirt size L both, from 2 different suppliers and this is smaller than the other, it seems that the actual size of this is S or M beacuse it is shorter and less wide",37993,2
37994,ok,37994,2
37995,"The shirt looked like it was good quality, however it said XXL on the label (like I ordered) but it was so small I couldn't even put it on.",37995,2
37995,I bought four and they all were very small.,37995,2
37995,Possibly miss marked.,37995,2
37995,They were Medium or Large at best,37995,2
37996,"Beautiful material, beautiful pattern - wanted to badly to pair with a sleek black turtleneck and black cardigan but whoops!",37996,2
37996,"Its WAAAY too small :(

I live in maxi skirt, wear them all the time.",37996,2
37996,"The poly material on this skirt lacks alot of stretch typical to these skirts, making it feel like a waist tourniquet.",37996,2

38004,I suggest maternity pants.,38004,2
38004,Don't waste your money.,38004,2
38005,"no bra support in the front, thin material, cheaply made.",38005,2
38006,"Material is heavy, which is good but it's too stiff as well.",38006,2

38020,Won't buy these again.,38020,2
38021,It came smaller then I was expecting.,38021,2
38021,I also thought the back was going to be longer and it was a normal looking blouse.,38021,2
38022,this is fake but normal quality.,38022,2
38022,sizes are correct,38022,2

38033,This is too small on our babies neck for him to grab and use the teething piece so we were disappointed.,38033,2

38034,I usually can wear a 10 or a 12.,38034,2

38056,"This skirt was so small, it wouldn't fit over my thighs.",38056,2
38056,"I almost think it's kids sizes, even though it's advertised as womens.",38056,2

38121,this does not look like tike the pic - what I received was a darker color and instead of looking like blue jean material it is just a cheap cotton with loose threads all over like someone sewed it together and didn't finish - I was disappointed  - the little necklace was cute,38121,2
38122,"To small, very low cut on sides, have to wear a tank under.",38122,2
38122,The print also was not like shown mine was more faded n colors weren't as bright as shown in picture.,38122,2
38123,"It's a very pretty dress, but very small.",38123,2
38123,Order at least 2 sizes up!,38123,2
38124,I really wanted to like this one but unfortunately the back was too big and draped funny with the straps so I ended up returning...,38124,2
38125,It is nice looking but run smaller than i think.,38125,2
38125,It is good for Asian skiny girls,38125,2
38126,Poor quality!,38126,2
38126,!,38126,2
38127,This bracelet is a child size.,38127,2
38127,Purchased as a gift for a woman with a small wrist and does not fit.,38127,2
38127,Now cannot return.,38127,2
38127,Disappointed.,38127,2
38128,While they do indeed make your rings fit more snuggly; they don't stay on very well.,38128,2
38128,And heaven help you if you forget you have them on and go to scratch your head or arms...the edges are pretty sharp and will leave a good dig on your forehead.,38128,2
38128,And once you've worn them for a while (more than a couple of hours) be prepared to notice one or more of them missing; as they have a habit of falling off.,38128,2
38129,They had a great design and everything but I ordered some 3 sizes too big and they still were way too small.,38129,2
38130,Too thick and too small plus did not expect a thong did not say in description.,38130,2
38130,There is a reason I only buy one when trying a new product.,38130,2
38131,Shrunk considerably after first wash.,38131,2
38132,Very thin fabric.,38132,2
38132,Too tight,38132,2
38133,Chain leaves a dirty mark around my neck and coloring from back and sides of the necklace quickly wore off.,38133,2
38134,the beads are pink.,38134,2
38134,not red like the photo.,38134,2
38135,"The bra is way to small, but I already discarded the packaging and wore it before I noticed.",38135,2
38135,Will return and get a bigger size since the product seems to run small.,38135,2
38136,The material seems very cheap,38136,2
38137,Size fits around waist except for the top too large the dress should be ordered different according to waists n tops,38137,2
38138,Very roomy.,38138,2
38138,But the zipper broke almost immediately.,38138,2
38139,Sized wrong,38139,2
38140,Material is not good quality.,38140,2
38140,Fit is ok. Wont recommend to friends,38140,2
38141,Cheap.,38141,2
38142,We ordered a size 16 for my daughter and it's more like a size 10.,38142,2
38142,The waist area is super small!!!,38142,2
38142,The dress is pretty.,38142,2
38142,But doesn't help us if it doesn't fit.....,38142,2
38143,It's mint.,38143,2
38143,Not grass green.,38143,2
38143,"I'm 5' 7"" and it's pretty much a shirt.",38143,2
38144,ok,38144,2
38145,Very low quality with uneven finish on the tips.,38145,2
38145,My set came with a missing point locking bolt on one of the screwdrivers.,38145,2
38145,Not recommended for professional use.,38145,2
38146,Not a fan.,38146,2
38147,"Looks good and I'm sure it works well, however it is entirely too small.",38147,2
38147,Wouldn't hold all the cards I have in a simple SLIM wallet.,38147,2
38147,Kinda sad.,38147,2
38148,Material look and feel very cheap.,38148,2
38149,Not really.,38149,2
38149,Way too large.,38149,2
38149,More of a suitcase than hand bag.,38149,2
38149,Will add to luggage.,38149,2
38150,"This coat is labeled as a 1X, which to me means a size 18-20.",38150,2
38150,"The label on the inside, however, says it's a size 22-24 (and a generously cut 22-24 at that).",38150,2
38150,"The outer shell is pure PLASTIC.. it doesn't breath and there are no vents in it, either.",38150,2
38150,Wearing this without the liner would be like wearing plastic wrap.,38150,2
38150,"The liner is buttoned to the shell except for the sleeves, so every time I put my arms in the coat it pushes the liner outside the cuffs.",38150,2
38150,"It's a nice enough coat, but it's too big.",38150,2
38150,"And because it's plastic, it's constantly making plastic-y rustling noises.",38150,2
38150,I really hate this coat and plan to donate it to charity.,38150,2
38150,"I'm giving it two stars, however, because I should have listened to other reviews about Women Within clothing so it's partly my fault, and because I do love the anorak style.",38150,2
38151,Meh.,38151,2
38151,That is really my review.,38151,2
38151,Meh,38151,2
38152,Way to small.,38152,2
38152,They cannot even fit my three years old girl.,38152,2
38153,Not helpful for someone who depends on cheaters.,38153,2
38154,I ordered one and loved the print and the fit but the second one I ordered fit very differently and was too short too look nice.,38154,2
38154,I think there should be better consistency in the product.,38154,2
38155,The bottom has fringe and it's very poorly stitched.,38155,2
38155,I wouldn't buy it again or gift it.,38155,2
38156,They are sheer and were not advertised as so.,38156,2
38156,More of a tight then a leggin.,38156,2
38157,Needs to be offered in a wide calf,38157,2
38158,Very small for a 4-6 size.,38158,2
38158,The sleeves were halfway up my forearm.,38158,2
38159,Broke when I wore it.,38159,2
38160,Wrong size altogether.,38160,2
38161,"very cute, but after the first wash look wear out",38161,2
38162,Bad quality belt...this happened just trying it on!!!,38162,2
38162,I mean I know you get what you paid for but c'mon!!!!,38162,2
38162,"Also, I thought this was a waist belt for like a dress and no, it's way wider than what I thought.",38162,2
38162,The sizing is correct though.,38162,2
38163,looked good.,38163,2
38163,fell apart second time i wore it.,38163,2
38164,I'm not sure I quite like the quality and style of the hat and I can't be bothered to return it.,38164,2
38164,"It seem to offer fair warmth,  which is maybe the biggest plus.",38164,2
38164,The fit is not bad.,38164,2
38164,I also noticed that the earflaps weren't symmetrical in design and it was slight noticeable when strapped.,38164,2
38164,I maybe would have passed on an in-store purchase!,38164,2
38165,The product hasn't a second fitting for the smaller handle which is showed on the pictures.,38165,2
38165,And I was really disappointed to get it in a plastic bag and not a in a box - I have payed 23$ only for the fast delivery!,38165,2
38165,All in all it is okay but the quality isn't what I had expected.,38165,2
38165,"The golden elements are already corrode, thats a pitty because I should change them.",38165,2
38165,By the way a Return is more expensive than the product is worth.,38165,2
38165,The only benefit it is a fancy bag and the people are getting curious when you are at the cinema :),38165,2
38166,The ball on the end of the stud is nonexistent...the studs slip right out of your nose.,38166,2
38166,Luckily they send a lot of studs for a low price...,38166,2
38166,The assorted color studs are mostly pink...not much variety.,38166,2
38167,Not very good quality material.,38167,2
38167,Size is slight on the small size.,38167,2
38167,"However, material is very thin.",38167,2
38167,Will be returning.,38167,2
38168,"If you're thinking about buying this I would suggest going up a size, possibly even two.",38168,2
38168,"When it came in the mail I opened it and it had fit decently well, but right after one wash it shrunk down to what I could only describe as a child's size small.",38168,2
38169,This is a really cute blouse if only the lace didn't fall apart after one wash. And it is made with some sort of elastic so there are little pieces of elastic string all over the place.,38169,2
38169,No washing instructions so I washed on delicate and hung dry.,38169,2
38170,It doesn't have the button hole in for it to close up top.,38170,2
38171,"I didn't like it
Fits smaller, very thin cloth, it looks transparent.",38171,2
38172,"Very cute, but way too small!",38172,2
38172,"I Extremely small, I ordered a size large, I'm normally a size medium.",38172,2
38172,I should I ordered a Extra Large.,38172,2
38172,2 stars because it's cute.,38172,2
38173,Really disappointed.,38173,2
38173,"The first time I put on a pair, they ripped a hole near the top.",38173,2
38173,"When I pulled them on, I could hear seams popping.",38173,2
38173,And I'm sure I ordered the correct size.,38173,2
38173,They just don't seem to be very well made.,38173,2
38174,Shirt is very short.,38174,2
38174,I  like my shirts a little longer.,38174,2
38174,It stopped right at the top of my jeans.,38174,2
38174,"Also, when I requested to return it is was asked for pictures of myself in it and other odd things.",38174,2
38174,"For the price of it, it wasn't worth all the trouble.",38174,2
38174,I will give it away.,38174,2
38175,Didn't like the material.,38175,2
38176,"RAN VERY SMALL, COLOR TOO BRIGHT",38176,2
38177,This is definitely a unisex product.,38177,2
38177,On a woman it's baggy in all the wrong places.,38177,2
38177,Holding my arms out the armpits were about a foot away from where they should be.,38177,2
38177,Part of that is my fault because I assumed it was a woman's robe from the pictures but it really is 'unisex'.,38177,2
38177,The tie tends to slide and become unknotted.,38177,2
38177,"I was hoping it would be a bit sexier, but it needs a good steaming to get the hard wrinkles out.",38177,2
38177,A miss for me.,38177,2
38177,If you have larger proportions this would probably work much better.,38177,2
38177,"Aside from fit, I liked the material and its quality was actually better than I expected, no pilling or fraying.",38177,2
38178,"strangest dress I have ever seen, the top looked nothing like the picture, it was worse.",38178,2
38178,"Skirt to small around the waist and then
poofs out way to much",38178,2
38179,"Unfortunately it's too small and a bit rigid, I have to return it",38179,2
38180,Awsome chain.,38180,2
38180,Looks very cool BUT the skull end hook breaks easy which makes the chain shorter every time it happens..,38180,2
38181,Do not like how it fit,38181,2
38182,"not very attractive...its not what it looks like in this picture, its made cheaply.",38182,2
38183,I ordered the big 3XL not the long version.,38183,2
38183,Very unhappy with purchase!,38183,2
38183,"The big version is huge and way, way too long!!",38183,2
38183,"Quality seems okay, but it might as well be trash material because of the fit.",38183,2
38183,Expensive mistake.,38183,2
38184,Do not buy it !,38184,2
38185,Just no.,38185,2
38185,Sorry.,38185,2
38186,Not good,38186,2
38187,I bought this for someone who has a smaller frame and even at an XL it was still too small or even her.,38187,2
38187,"other than that, its a very pretty shirt.",38187,2
38187,too bad its not going to be worn.,38187,2
38188,Definitely should have read reviews before purchasing this top!,38188,2
38188,It's very nice looking but runs at least 2-3 sizes small (I didn't even attempt to try it on).,38188,2
38188,"For the price, I'll find a friend or family member to give it to or I would be sending it back!",38188,2
38189,poor materialI  donated it,38189,2
38190,Length was shorter than I would have liked,38190,2
38191,sleeves too long,38191,2
38192,Absolutely not worth the fifteen dollars I paid for these.,38192,2
38192,My daughter asked for these masks for her birthday and is going to be insanely disappointed with how soon they end up in the trash.,38192,2
38192,"They're super fun, and the kids love them, but I'd say they're closer to dollar bin quality.",38192,2
38193,dont waste money,38193,2
38194,Cheap material and made to fit small woman with no breasts.,38194,2
38195,This dress looks very promising on the picture however once here I was underwhelmed.,38195,2
38195,The tulle is very thin and looks cheap.,38195,2
38195,I believe if you get the dress be ready to add more tulle to the dress to make it more classy.,38195,2
38195,I'm not vested enough to do so.,38195,2
38196,Cheaply made.,38196,2
38197,I was disappointed that the back is so short!!,38197,2
38197,!,38197,2
38198,I expected to fit but it's tight on me,38198,2
38199,the first day that I used the satchel the shoulder strap clasp broke.,38199,2
38199,There wasn't that much weight to the purse either.,38199,2
38200,It was too small and the option to choose a size was not available.,38200,2
38200,The material was of good quality.,38200,2
38201,I normally wear a medium but purchased a large.,38201,2
38201,It fits fine but the shirt was not dyed equally so there are large areas on the shirt that are lighter color than the rest.,38201,2
38202,Bought for my son.,38202,2
38202,Ordered size 10 since that's what his previous ones were and they still fit.,38202,2
38202,"Received these and they were way too small, barely fit on foot.",38202,2
38202,Returned these and went to store and bought same pair in a size 10  and fit perfectly.,38202,2
38202,Not sure why but the online size 10 were much smaller.,38202,2
38203,So large I had to return them.,38203,2
38203,I've always worn 40 M - but these were huge!,38203,2
38203,And I had to pay the return postage .,38203,2
38203,.,38203,2
38203,.,38203,2
38204,"Very cheap, clip breaks easy and glasses fall out.",38204,2
38205,The green color for some reason doesn't fit as well as others I have purchased.,38205,2
38205,Disappointed.,38205,2
38206,"Fits ok but it is a faded black color, not a deep black color.",38206,2
38207,I love it but clasp broke after two weeks.,38207,2
38207,It's definitely a conversation piece about cancer awareness and to support cancer patients.,38207,2
38208,"The jacket is ok, somewhat flimsy.",38208,2
38208,"Didn't pay much, so met my expectations.",38208,2
38209,Not right style.,38209,2
38209,Broken when delivered.,38209,2
38210,"Not only was the tunic a bit too small (no roominess), but the quality of the material was much below standard.",38210,2
38210,I do not recommend this item.,38210,2
38211,I thought it had a little stretch to it,38211,2
38212,so narrow it does not stay on my ear.,38212,2
38213,I thought I ordered a white background but received a light blue and it was to be a scarf but is a large shawl.,38213,2
38213,I will need to cut it down to a scarf size in order to wear it.,38213,2
38214,It fits a lot bigger than expected.,38214,2
38215,Suction does not work as described and easily fall.,38215,2
38215,Returned it,38215,2
38216,Really cute but awful quality.,38216,2
38216,The chain broke within a few days.,38216,2
38217,"not flattering if you have a short torso, and will not fit if you have large boobs.",38217,2
38218,"I am very tiny 5'6"" and about 103 lbs.",38218,2
38218,"I ordered smalls, and they are TIGHT, they always ride up a lot higher then I like, so its not very comfortable at all.......the waist band is very thick.",38218,2
38218,"The material is great quality though, its mainly the fit that isn't great.",38218,2
38219,Straps give out very quickly.,38219,2
38219,I had the product for two days before it broke and all I carried in it was my laptop.,38219,2
38220,"I LOVE the feel of these socks, but I cannot recommend them.",38220,2
38220,These socks would be perfect if they went up my leg about an inch further and stayed up.,38220,2
38220,They hardly go up my leg and the band around the top is too flimsy to keep them secure around my calves.,38220,2
38220,"I'm disappointed because I love everything else (colors, style, design, softness, material).",38220,2
38220,"I'm hoping to find something similar, but that will stay up around my calves.",38220,2
38221,I ordered this for my 14yo for homecoming.,38221,2
38221,We took measurements and used the size chart.,38221,2
38221,"She is 5'4, 125lbs and wears a size 3 jeans.",38221,2
38221,Chart said size 6 so that's what we ordered.,38221,2
38221,"The fit is pretty good, the chest is a bit large for her, she is a B cup, but it's padded and shaped enough that it works.",38221,2
38221,"The length is good, just above the knee but not too short, appropriate for young teen and school dances.",38221,2
38221,"Material is good quality, color is nice but the rhinestones are a disaster.",38221,2
38221,Right upon opening the dress up I saw multiple stones missing from the front chest and they weren't even in the packaging to sew back on.,38221,2
38221,They are loosely sewn on with a very fine plastic thread and all in one run with no ties so if the thread breaks at all between beads it just unravels and they all start to fall off.,38221,2
38221,When we carefully tried the dress on stones were falling off the sheer chest material and the bottom.,38221,2
38221,I spent over 3 hours carefully sewing many many stones back on and trying to move some to even out the front where they were missing and we had no replacements.,38221,2
38221,The snaps at the neckline are very cheap and sewn on.,38221,2
38221,One fell off when trying to unsnap it and had to be sewn back on as well.,38221,2
38221,Overall the dress is beautiful and my daughter loves it (now that I've fixed it) but for the price I was very disappointed with the beadwork and to have it just falling off like it did.,38221,2
38221,Definitely not worth the price.,38221,2
38221,Had I not fixed it myself it would have cost even more to have someone else fix it or we would have had even more stones falling off and the dress would be ruined.,38221,2
38221,Next time we'll likely find a dress in person so we can inspect the quality.,38221,2
38222,I got a size bigger because I am big chested.,38222,2
38222,It was still extremely tight and and no support for my breast.,38222,2
38223,Not to my liking,38223,2
38224,A costume....not a party dress,38224,2
38225,These are beautiful tie clips but they are horribly difficult to open and actually latch around the tie and your shirt; do not recommend.,38225,2
38226,Way too long for petite fit.,38226,2
38226,Returned it.,38226,2
38227,"The outfit is pretty long I'm 5'2 and had to get the skirt altered
The top is very big which also needs to be altered but.",38227,2
38227,How the skirt lays on the model in the pic it does not actually lay like that in person.,38227,2
38227,It's more puffy less flow.,38227,2
38227,It was nice a day on the beach.,38227,2
38227,The picture posted is just the bottom from the order because the top was way too big.,38227,2
38228,The quality was very cheap in my opinion.,38228,2
38228,Not worth the money.,38228,2
38228,The colors were not very vibrant either.,38228,2
38229,The dress itself is beautiful but  the cut is was smaller that the size chart .,38229,2
38229,I measured myself  and went according to the chart and it was way off .,38229,2
38229,I would recommending going up a size ...2 if you want to be comfortable.,38229,2
38229,I returned the dress,38229,2
38230,"Very sad it is too small, but they gave me a refund.",38230,2
38231,I ordered this shirt as a fathers day present for my husband from my 4 year old son.,38231,2
38231,They both enjoy TMNT!,38231,2
38231,"However, upon receiving the product it had a very strong medicinal vingery smell and it was blurry.",38231,2
38231,"My 4 year old son's immediate reaction was ""WASH IT.""",38231,2
38231,As far as the imaging and wording being blurry/pixelated I guess you get what you pay for.,38231,2
38232,Top fits as expected but the bottom is way to big.,38232,2
38232,Am 5 ft 6 an Weight 200lb with hip 43 n its too huge,38232,2
38233,One protector stayed in tact after a whole night and the other broke within 10 minutes and was halfway up my heel.,38233,2
38233,I had read the reviews saying they broke but really had no choice so I had to give them a try.,38233,2
38233,"I think they are ok if you have to walk on grass for a wedding ceremony but if the event is in grass or gravel for several hours, maybe you should buy wedges or fatter heels.",38233,2
38234,Product satin but it is very thin :(,38234,2
38235,Disappointed with this purchase.,38235,2
38235,the symbol is off-centered and the rope across the front is not braided as shown in the photo (which was the reason i chose this particular hat in the first place).,38235,2
38235,Not worth the $.,38235,2
38236,It is very pretty but the finish started wearing off about 3 weeks after getting it.,38236,2
38237,Didn't like the material,38237,2
38238,Color not as shown in picture!,38238,2
38239,beads all fell off,38239,2
38240,size is very small,38240,2
38241,These are ok I wish they were a bit longer but the work I use them as earrings not sure what the are meant for but work well enough but I wish they were a bit longer and lighter they seem heavy,38241,2
38242,Just ok.,38242,2
38243,very short,38243,2
38244,"The wallet is as sleek and sturdy as advertised, but that's about it.",38244,2
38244,The advertisement states you will have room for seven cards and it is simply not true.,38244,2
38244,"After loading seven cards into it (5 bank cards, my ID, and a health insurance card), it struggled to close and randomly popped open after a few seconds of being clasped.",38244,2
38244,"While it did not advertise the capability to, I'd like to point out it cannot hold business cards at all.",38244,2
38244,"Any cash held will also need to be folded a minimum of three times, meaning you're pushing it carrying more than four bills.",38244,2
38244,Good luck carrying most world currency as well.,38244,2
38244,It's a gorgeous case with an inside that was designed horrifically.,38244,2
38244,"The only way I could recommend this case is if you only needed to carry your ID, two or three bank cards, and minimal cash.",38244,2
38245,It fit but ripped instantly as wearing,38245,2
38246,The product wasn't what it looked like in the photo.,38246,2
38247,Made poorly don't like,38247,2
38248,Cheaply made (price was fairly indicative of that).,38248,2
38248,"My wife meant to give it as a gift, and decided against it due to the poor quality.",38248,2
38249,doesn'n stretch shoe width enough.,38249,2
38250,"I'd like to be able to say these are great, but they are not.",38250,2
38250,I sized up for my daughter who is a size 1 and a 32 B did not fit very well.,38250,2
38250,Small cups for a B and small band.,38250,2
38250,The band is ok with an extender but we ended up getting rid of them.,38250,2
38250,They didn't hold up great in the wash and had snags in the material.,38250,2
38250,"If I were in a pinch I'd size up again and make do, bit I'd rather buy 1 better bra than all of these for the same price.",38250,2
38251,This is not swimsuit material!,38251,2
38251,(But it's hella cute).,38251,2
38251,I wanted to wear it as a tennis dress but the material is just not breathable enough so now it sits in my closet,38251,2
38252,"I have an brown, non-RFID version of this that is at least seven years old.",38252,2
38252,"I ordered a black, RFID wallet and although the box is labeled black, the color is indistinguishable from the old, brown one.",38252,2
38252,I asked my son and he thought they were the same color.,38252,2
38252,"Too bad, I really like my old one.",38252,2
38252,I will look at another brand where black is really black.,38252,2
38252,And it is not just a mis-mark issue.,38252,2
38252,The stitching on my brown one is lighter like the current mahogany color.,38252,2
38252,"The ""black"" one I received has the same dark stitching shown in the item image.",38252,2
38253,"The reason I am giving two stars is that the shorts themselves are nicely made and really cool looking but be aware, A 3XXX is NOT a 3XXX it is at best a XL.",38253,2
38253,Fortunately they fit my husband so I gave them to him.,38253,2
38253,I Am a female but have bought board shorts for years.,38253,2
38253,The size is Not accurate.,38253,2
38254,Racer back does not fit well.,38254,2
38254,"Like others stated, cuts into lats and is uncomfortable.",38254,2
38254,The collar is flimsy and doesn't sit flat.,38254,2
38254,The material is actually nice and printing is also good.,38254,2
38255,it was not fitting the way it should,38255,2
38256,"Didn't fit me even in the largest size, gave it to my 11 year old and it ripped a week after getting it.",38256,2
38257,Fits very small must order 2 sizes up or you will not be able to close the front.,38257,2
38257,Pattern is pretty.,38257,2
38258,"Like the pattern, but bead is to small.",38258,2
38259,They fit perfect but the material reminds me of .. a cheap swim suit.,38259,2
38259,Not my favorite.,38259,2
38260,"These are okay, just not for me.",38260,2
38260,"I like harem pants, but the elastic around the legs bothered me.",38260,2
38260,"And maybe it's just me, but I would rather have just one band of elastic around the waist, too.",38260,2
38260,"Pants this baggy should hide a pocket or two, as well, then I'd be all over them.",38260,2
38260,"You get what you pay for, so I'm moving on.",38260,2
38260,Returned.,38260,2
38261,Bought for my costume.. Ended up letting my 3 year old wear it.,38261,2
38261,It's for a child,38261,2
38262,This is NOT a shirt with sleeves.,38262,2
38262,It is only a scarf.,38262,2
38262,"The body came up above my belly button, sleeves were long.",38262,2
38262,But nothing like the picture,38262,2
38263,"Not good quality from the fabric, button and design.",38263,2
38263,I would not order this Label again.,38263,2
38264,"I liked the style however I had to alter the top section because the sizing was very very small
for the advertised plus size......",38264,2
38265,It really is a huge dress.,38265,2
38265,"I got a size down from what I normally wear, and it was still too big.",38265,2
38266,This was not made to fit like the picture.,38266,2
38266,Sizing was all wrong and didn't make sense.,38266,2
38267,Studs are coming off - it's heavy and simply bad quality!,38267,2
38268,"Went by the reviews two sizes larger,  big mistake way to big a med or large would have likely fit.",38268,2
38268,"Not impressed with the quality:  size zag stitching for all finished edges, the color was a dull gray .",38268,2
38268,The add photo looked like a deeper blue grey.,38268,2
38269,I like this enough.,38269,2
38269,The big problem is that the key holding mechanism breaks.,38269,2
38269,"First one of the little metal pieces failed, then the string.",38269,2
38269,It's not like I was being super crazy with my keys either.,38269,2
38269,I now have my keys attached to the nylon loop that would be attached to the key string.,38269,2
38269,Still works but not the way I wanted.,38269,2
38270,"Very cute top and material felt great, but was delivered with huge mold stain covering the front half of the shirt leaving it unwearable.",38270,2
38271,Top is difficult to put on,38271,2
38272,"Way too small , looks nothing like pic",38272,2
38273,Not the nicest quality,38273,2
38274,This product size chart is inaccurate,38274,2
38275,These have WAY too much fabric for shorts!,38275,2
38275,They are too long and too baggy!,38275,2
38276,needed plastic inserts,38276,2
38277,My daughter used this backpack for one week when the first zipper pull fell off.,38277,2
38277,"Then yesterday, just one month into the school year, the other one fell off.",38277,2
38277,"This is very cute, but it is thin, and not very durable for daily use.",38277,2
38277,Wish I could return it because now I had to go out and buy another backpack because this could not withstand the daily use of an 8 year old.,38277,2
38278,The hats fits small to be slouch,38278,2
38279,too small,38279,2
38280,"It isn't the material it seems in the picture, it looks like it would be good material, but feels/looks like a cheaper forever 21 version of itself also bottom doesn't fish out like it should more like a pencil style with extra material",38280,2
38281,Made from latex.,38281,2
38281,Fingers don't flex easily and the material folds when they do.,38281,2
38281,I would recommend looking for a pair of cloth gloves.,38281,2
38281,"If you don't care about the number of fingers, white parade gloves work well for cartoon characters.",38281,2
38282,"It has lots of stretch, but not fitted to body.",38282,2
38282,Flares out a bit for a awkward fit.,38282,2
38283,I bought a bunch for my three year old twins.,38283,2
38283,The waistband has twisted on about half of all the pairs I bought.,38283,2
38283,Total disappointment.,38283,2
38284,"This was pretty cheap looking, and won't be very durable.",38284,2
38284,Biggest complaint from my wife is the bands don't stay in place and keep covering up the charms,38284,2
38285,Tight fit.,38285,2
38285,And on the inside of the pocket it was ripped.,38285,2
38286,Doesn't fit or look like picture.,38286,2
38286,Seemed to take forever to receive.,38286,2
38286,Not the long baggie sweatshirt I was looking for.,38286,2
38287,It pulls up in the back.,38287,2
38287,And it can get hot,38287,2
38288,"Although this tank top fit as I expected, I wasn't expecting the cheap quality!",38288,2
38288,"I also thought it was black, but it's actually charcoal grey.",38288,2
38288,"So, I was a little disappointed when I received it.",38288,2
38288,I plan to keep it because the graphic goes perfectly with a pair of leggings I have and it's not worth paying for shipping again to return it.,38288,2
38289,I bought these for my son who was just starting to walk.,38289,2
38289,"It's a good idea but they slide off his feet easily, we tried them multiple times but my son eventually got sick of them sliding off and didn't want to wear them anymore.",38289,2
38290,Just a very awkward fit for a curvy girl and the lace looks very very cheap,38290,2
38291,Material was pretty thin and it didn't seem very sturdy,38291,2
38292,can barley read the writing..,38292,2
38293,Very thin and tore a few months after purchase.,38293,2
38293,"Also, they run small.",38293,2
38294,Cheaply made.,38294,2
38294,Wouldnt buy again,38294,2
38295,The sizes are not true,38295,2
38296,Definitely doesn't look anything like the picture or the description.,38296,2
38296,I ordered a M and it fits like an XL.,38296,2
38296,"Poor quality material, cheaply made.",38296,2
38296,Definitely do not recommend!,38296,2
38297,"Shirt was too small, even after ordering the next size up (b/c of how the Asian sizes are smaller than US).",38297,2
38297,"Shirt came, took shirt out of package, and the crocheted part on the arm was ripped already.",38297,2
38297,Cheap product.,38297,2
38297,Shirt was waaaaay too small.,38297,2
38297,Not good.,38297,2
38297,Don't do it.,38297,2
38298,Elastic was too tight and left a red indented ring on my skin along the top of my foot and around the ankle.,38298,2
38298,"The size of the socks were fitted fine, and the material was a good thickness, but unfortunately the elastic was way too tight and dug into the skin.",38298,2
38299,I ordered XL in women's.,38299,2
38299,These fit like a size 3 in women's.,38299,2
38299,Runs very small!,38299,2
38300,"It was good quality material, but it was way toooo small.",38300,2
38301,Came with a REALLY bad smell.,38301,2
38301,I am working on trying to get the smell out and hope it will clear soon.,38301,2
38302,Gems were falling off as i was removing it from the bag.,38302,2
38302,Too big in the bust area.,38302,2
38302,Thought the lacing and gems were silver but they were gold.,38302,2
38302,"Returned it, had to pay UPS $10.99 for the return.",38302,2
38303,"It's as advertised, and the quality is fine--but it's TINY, just 2 inches by about 3-7/8.",38303,2
38303,"It may hold 10 cards (I don't have 10 to test it), but they poke out the top, and there's no place at all to carry cash.",38303,2
38303,"U.S. currency has to be folded in quarters to fit into the small compartments, so a few bills fill it up, and the elastic band is too loose to secure them outside.",38303,2
38303,"I question the durability of that strap, too.",38303,2
38303,It doesn't feel like it will withstand a few thousand stretches.,38303,2
38303,"If you travel with one or two cards, rarely use cash and don't wind up with a wad of $1 bills every day, this could work for you as a front-pocket wallet for occasional use.",38303,2
38303,It doesn't work at all for me.,38303,2
38304,good product,38304,2
38305,Wouldn't buy an adjustable one that's cheeper,38305,2
38306,I follow the feedback i read to get the next size up but unfortunately doesn't fit right,38306,2
38307,Hat looks nothing like the picture.,38307,2
38307,It looks like a floppy hobo hat.,38307,2
38308,"The size, although marked XXL, was more of a L/Xl.",38308,2
38309,Balls fall off way to easily.,38309,2
38309,Lost mine within a week.,38309,2
38310,"This dress has a flaw in the way it was cut, making the other parts of the dress end up two inches too high.",38310,2
38310,"If it didn't have this mistake, it would be a wonderful dress, but now it is useless and I missed the return time.",38310,2
38311,"Somewhat small
But adorable none the less
Probably should have ordered the next size up",38311,2
38312,"Weird fit and fabric, returned",38312,2
38313,"The chart it's wrong , they fit but very tied and I know for sure M it's always fine if not loose on me.",38313,2
38314,I was very disappointed.,38314,2
38314,I thought this bracelet would be a lot thicker than it was.,38314,2
38314,"It was too thin, too small, easily breakable.",38314,2
38314,And more suited for a child.,38314,2
38314,I could not even feel it on my wrist and it does not stick out in any way.,38314,2
38314,I will be returning it.,38314,2
38314,It was not a good investment.,38314,2
38315,I bought this watch as a gift for a friend.,38315,2
38315,I also bought the black one for her as well (Music Major).,38315,2
38315,The white and black came separate but in similar packaging.,38315,2
38315,"It was just in an envelope, which is why the face of the white watch was shattered.",38315,2
38315,I was very unsatisfied and was not asked if I would have liked a refund or a new one.,38315,2
38315,The band is very cheap and was basically a piece of thin plastic.,38315,2
38315,You would have to purchase a new band if you wanted this watch long term.,38315,2
38316,Not very good quality and fit was a little snug for boobs.,38316,2
38317,I don't like how this fits at all,38317,2
38318,Unhappy,38318,2
38319,Didn't expect it to have an iron patch.,38319,2
38320,Terrible fit,38320,2
38321,Way too small.,38321,2
38321,5 feet 9.5 inch 140lbs TOPS it barely got on me.,38321,2
38321,My ass was totally uncovered,38321,2
38322,again this item in picture is not what i got in the mail.,38322,2
38322,no special extra on the bottom like what the picture shows.,38322,2
38322,just straight flat ribing.,38322,2
38322,does purpose i intended.,38322,2
38323,This ring is beautiful.,38323,2
38323,I'm so glad I bought it until one of the prongs broke off.,38323,2
38323,Won't wear it for fear of losing the stone,38323,2
38324,Terrible zipper just pulled it out or I would've returned this coat.,38324,2
38324,Looks like I'll have to replace the zipper on this $200 coat.,38324,2
38324,Would definitely not recommend to anyone!,38324,2
38325,"Socks seem to be made top quality, however the size is way small for American feet.",38325,2
38325,"These should be listed as 3/4 socks since they only go about two inches above the ankle, less I'm sure if someone has size 12 feet (I'm a 10).",38325,2
38325,Returned.,38325,2
38326,Fake belt but looks good,38326,2
38327,Loose fitting.,38327,2
38327,Waist fit only,38327,2
38328,Not really good stuff.. Look like cheap chain..,38328,2
38328,But the leather is really nice..,38328,2
38329,"it will not fit my boobs at all, its super tight!",38329,2
38329,I feel like I'm wearing pasties,38329,2
38330,I bought these because my baby had active arms and hands.,38330,2
38330,Wanted to prevent scratches on the face.,38330,2
38330,These mittens didn't really work as after one wash the velcro base was exposed and when baby rus face the velcro would scratch face more than his nails did.,38330,2
38330,Will not purchase again.,38330,2
38331,Meh.,38331,2
38332,Careful this runs HUGE...I ordered a small because they didn't have any in x small and holy CRAP this is a small?,38332,2
38332,Maybe small for a hippo!,38332,2
38332,For me this is a large.,38332,2
38332,Returning.,38332,2
38332,So disappointed.,38332,2
38333,Way too small,38333,2
38334,The sleeves are shorter than in the picture.,38334,2
38334,The dress itself fits like a mumu but the slip underneath is almost too tight and does not go past the bottom of my ass cheeks.,38334,2
38334,3 of the 6 clasps at the top of the dress were already gone or in the process of ripping out.,38334,2
38334,Sent it back.,38334,2
38335,Not nice enough quality for the price.,38335,2
38336,they have blue marks from the factory and I didn't like that since it's noticeable.,38336,2
38337,Chain broke immediately after putting it on.,38337,2
38337,The heart isn't really pretty at all.,38337,2
38338,The color was nice.,38338,2
38338,Looked good too.,38338,2
38338,It was just too big for me.,38338,2
38339,So disappointed.,38339,2
38339,So many issues.,38339,2
38339,"Too small, somewhat melted together upon arrival, and quality is very poor.",38339,2
38339,Many of the reviews on here suggested going a size down because it apparently runs small.,38339,2
38339,This was not the case for me.,38339,2
38339,A size down made it near impossible to get on.,38339,2
38339,"And unfortunately there ware no fasteners or zippers in the back, which would have been extremely helpful.",38339,2
38339,The material on the bust is awful.,38339,2
38339,Super scratchy/itchy material.,38339,2
38339,Very hot and uncomfortable.,38339,2
38339,"The skirt bunches at the top, so it's kind of a mushroom shape down there.",38339,2
38339,Not flattering at all.,38339,2
38339,When I opened my package all the material was slightly melted together as well.,38339,2
38339,Pulling the pieces apart from one another resulted in discoloration.,38339,2
38339,Very unhappy with this purchase.,38339,2
38339,I'm pretty sure it's not returnable now either because I already unpackaged everything in order to try it on.,38339,2
38340,I ordered according to the size chart and it came in a bit smaller than I wanted.,38340,2
38340,The sleeves are too tight and the stripes ate very poorly stitched.,38340,2
38340,Would not recommend,38340,2
38341,"This hat is extremely small for an adult, it should be advertised as kids size.",38341,2
38341,Very disappointed in under armour for this!,38341,2
38341,I have many of their products because their quality is great.,38341,2
38341,This is one of the few exceptions,38341,2
38342,junky,38342,2
38343,"The back is great, but the front broke way too easily.",38343,2
38343,"It was never dropped, and it still cracked very quickly.",38343,2
38344,This is just THIN.,38344,2
38344,"Material
Nothing flattering,
Pretty color I thought.",38344,2
38344,"That was it,
Made very very poor !",38344,2
38344,!!,38344,2
38344,"I had lotts of clothes in my life to
I don't lie,
Im very honest !",38344,2
38344,!,38344,2
38345,"Its doesn't fit as it shows, it's somewhat bigger than it looks.",38345,2
38345,Let's just say it doesn't huh the curves as it should,38345,2
38346,I will never know how these boots fit.,38346,2
38346,I simply could not put them on.,38346,2
38346,The opening is too narrow for a regular size foot to go through.,38346,2
38346,"I am guessing that if you have a smaller size, the combination of smaller foot and the angle you have to twist it into to actually squeeze your foot through the opening will be manageable.",38346,2
38346,"At size 9, however, I could not accomplish it.",38346,2
38346,"Two stars for quality and overall look, but mine are going back.",38346,2
38347,Shirt is really nice but the sizes are not constant.,38347,2
38347,"I ordered 2 shirts from Riot society (both XL) and this one was more like a M and the otherone its like a L or almost XL
Nice shirt but wrong sizeing",38347,2
38348,Fit way too tight!,38348,2
38348,!,38348,2
38349,"As a female, I bought these as a pair of shorts that I could sleep in during a Girls Weekend.",38349,2
38349,The color and the print is true to what the image shows.,38349,2
38349,They shipped out within the promised delivery date.,38349,2
38349,"The part that was disappointing to me is even after several washes they felt very ""starchy"".",38349,2
38349,Not at all a comfortable sleeping pair of shorts.,38349,2
38350,It's going back.,38350,2
38350,I'm too short for this shirt and the sleeves don't allow me good arm movement.,38350,2
38350,"The fabric is quite thin, and I was looking for something more substantial.",38350,2
38350,"In it's favour, it does have discreetly placed pockets.",38350,2
38350,It's just not the shirt for me.,38350,2
38351,Very strangely cut but no free return shipping so I'm stuck with it.,38351,2
38352,"First of all, I'm aware that I always wear a size Large or XL in a top.",38352,2
38352,"When I got the blouse, it said it was an XL just like I ordered, but it could barely fit around my arms and body (mind you that I'm kinda chunky but not heavy set).",38352,2
38352,It was a struggle to just try it on.,38352,2
38352,Do not get this unless you have a fairly thin or petite figure so that it fits properly on you.,38352,2
38353,To small  beautiful color!!,38353,2
38353,But order a bigger size,38353,2
38354,Very low quality material.,38354,2
38355,Gloves are good deal but not as thick and heavy duty as $50 pair.,38355,2
38355,I returned and purchased frabill gloves for ice fishing.,38355,2
38356,Material is Too thin,38356,2
38357,ok,38357,2
38358,poor quality,38358,2
38359,It's a interesting item.,38359,2
38359,It looked as if it was battery powered.,38359,2
38359,But that's my fault that I clicked instant buy before I read the item description.,38359,2
38359,But still not something I wear everyday.,38359,2
38360,I wish this would have worked out.,38360,2
38360,I wish the shirt actually looked like the one displayed that would have been even better.,38360,2
38360,I purchased the blue bird print top because I thought it was adorable and a great price.,38360,2
38360,"The shirt looked off white which is what I wanted, The shirt came in a not off white but a pale neon yellow that reminded me of my puppy's accidental puddles... not really what was pictured.",38360,2
38360,IF however the color was as shown I would have been a happy consumer.,38360,2
38361,The suit fit great and was flattering everywhere except the hips.,38361,2
38361,The hip areas where the suit has the cutouts is stretched out and sticks out further than the actual body of the suit.,38361,2
38361,Makes no sense.,38361,2
38361,Obviously poor garment construction is to blame.,38361,2
38362,To small,38362,2
38363,"Low quality product, you can just easily DIY this and have a better outcome.",38363,2
38363,Also it is more pricey than some of its competitors so I was expecting a lot more from this product.,38363,2
38363,The veil piece does not even cover my eyes.,38363,2
38363,"Pretty small too width wise (not like the picture at all), but the ears were pretty big and long though.",38363,2
38364,The both sides of the frame was slightly chipped/scuffed when I received the product.,38364,2
38364,"Even if mine is a singularly defective piece, I would not expect Ray Bans to chip like that at all.",38364,2
38364,"Apart from the existing damage to the item when received, the sun-glass looks nice.",38364,2
38365,Bottoms fit perf.,38365,2
38365,"The top not so much, it is just a long piece of cloth you have to figure out on your own.",38365,2
38365,Meant to fit small chested ladies.,38365,2
38365,"I am a 34DD and this has no support at ,spillage everywhere.",38365,2
38365,Had to buy a new top.,38365,2
38366,The zipper was defeated.,38366,2
38367,"Was a nice dress but ordered an 18 months, tag read 18 months but dress wouldn't have fit a 6 month old",38367,2
38368,way too small.,38368,2
38368,Gave to my daughter.,38368,2
38369,Too small,38369,2
38370,The straps are not long enough and there isn't enough side-boob coverage.,38370,2
38370,"I'm a C cup, 125 pounds, 5 ft 5 inches.",38370,2
38370,"Needless to say, the bottom fits fine.",38370,2
38370,I wouldn't recommend if you are a C cup or bigger.,38370,2
38371,Smaller than expected.,38371,2
38372,Gave as a gift and the receiver loved how cute they were.,38372,2
38372,"However, on her first wearing of them, they began to shed horribly and by the end of the first day, 2 eyes were missing and much fluff was gone.",38372,2
38373,This item is made for small breasts big bottom women.,38373,2
38373,I wear 38D and 9 for bottoms.,38373,2
38373,Top was way small couldn't even tie it and for the bottom the waist was fine just the butt part was too big.,38373,2
38374,"Received in a timely matter, the beads are a great quality but as the picture shows the pair, I only received of the pieces also, its made to fit any size In assuming but I am a size 6 and its a little too long from the toe loop to the ankle.",38374,2
38375,I just received this package in the mail yesterday.,38375,2
38375,"I've very pleased with the look of it, however, it was somewhat damp and had black dirt on it when I took it out of the package.",38375,2
38376,"No receipt was enclosed, so I am unable to return dresses.",38376,2
38376,They were so big and flimsy.,38376,2
38377,"Cheaply made, fraying around the edges.",38377,2
38378,These diamond studs arrived on time and in an everyday case.,38378,2
38378,No problems there.,38378,2
38378,"I've read the reviews here, and maybe my standards are high, or I got a bad pair, but these were cloudy and small...",38378,2
38378,I immediately repacked them and returned them to Amazon.,38378,2
38378,"A diamond ought to sparkle in the light, but these were milky white and not of great quality.",38378,2
38378,"I do not think the listing is too inaccurate-- it says the studs are lower on the quality sphere, but keep in mind-- these are not the more clear or stunning diamonds... at all.",38378,2
38379,"Material doesn't seem durable, but OK for the price",38379,2
38380,"Don't buy, I will possibly be able to wear as swim suit cover but that is it.",38380,2
38380,The top sides come in so much that it isn't work with any bra and shows so much side boob.,38380,2
38380,Disappointed,38380,2
38381,"I am a women's size 9.5/10 shoe, and I ordered the women's 8.5-10 and they are to small.",38381,2
38381,My toes are so scrunched I only kept them on for seconds before ripping them off of my feet.,38381,2
38381,"If you order these, I suggest that you order a size bigger.",38381,2
38381,They are made in Korea.,38381,2
38382,"The ears on the hat are not cat ears, they are very round like teddy bear ears.",38382,2
38382,They are also in a strange placement.,38382,2
38382,Product does not look at all the same as the photos.,38382,2
38382,The only thing that kept me from giving it 1 star is that the material seems well made.,38382,2
38383,This bathing suit is a great material and does not feel cheap.,38383,2
38383,However I ordered an extra large but the cups for the top are too close together even for being an extra large size.,38383,2
38383,My chest is popping out the sides and I don't even have a large bust.,38383,2
38384,Some cute one.,38384,2
38384,But package only contained 88 not 100.,38384,2
38384,But overall OK,38384,2
38385,The sweatsuit is not the best quality but it's OK,38385,2
38386,"I love the natural stones, but when I purchased one set on a different credit card, they charged that with my original order.",38386,2
38386,Then someone else from them charged me again on the card on file.,38386,2
38386,Both were sent together with my other items.,38386,2
38386,The only reason I didn't dispute it was because I was able to use both sets to make them match better.,38386,2
38386,"However, the rubber O rings irritate my ear lobes and they kinda blister and sting so I have to wear my plugs without them and hope they don't pop out.",38386,2
38386,The groove for the O rings is quite shallow to begin with.,38386,2
38387,I couldn't even get this on my 4 month daughter.,38387,2
38387,Cute but needs a better way to put on.,38387,2
38388,"These pants do not have a designated ""front"" or ""back"" so they fit oddly.",38388,2
38388,They were also put together cheap and quick; there are threads loose and now fraying.,38388,2
38388,I am only keeping them becuase they were cheap and I don't want to hassle with sending them back,38388,2
38389,One of the straps broke after a month,38389,2
38390,I couldn't tell if this hat was too large for me (which would be unusual) or just a very weird design.,38390,2
38390,"In either case, I could not get it to rest on my head in any way that seemed sustainable.",38390,2
38390,"I also didn't like the feel of the material, and the color didn't look like it would go with much.",38390,2
38390,"It has two stars because I only want to give one star if I actively hate something, but this hat was confusing and I got it away from myself as soon as I could.",38390,2
38390,Is that hatred?,38390,2
38390,I don't know.,38390,2
38391,"I liked this bag, I really did.",38391,2
38391,"It's a great size, holds a ton of stuff, and fits in most airplane overhead compartments.",38391,2
38391,It looks fantastic and I have gotten numerous compliments.,38391,2
38391,"But, and this is a big but, it is very shoddily made.",38391,2
38391,"Within a month of buying the bag, the metal clasp holding the shoulder strap to the edge of the bag snapped.",38391,2
38391,"After about 10-15 uses, the zipper broke.",38391,2
38391,I would save your money and buy something constructed a little more sturdily.,38391,2
38392,I am a very short person and this barely covered butt.,38392,2
38392,More like a shirt.,38392,2
38392,Different color then pictured.,38392,2
38392,The bottom of the lace was poorly cut and not hemmed.,38392,2
38392,But cute with leggings.,38392,2
38392,What can you expect for the price.,38392,2
38393,"Legitimately so tight around my shoulders that I removed the elastic and am making ""barmaid straps"" out of black lace for a cold shoulder, in lieu of off the shoulder, look.",38393,2
38394,The quality is not good.,38394,2
38394,The price should be under $5.,38394,2
38395,"Quality made product, too short for a tall person.",38395,2
38395,Lacked adequate adjustment range.,38395,2
38396,"Looked nice in picture, but quality was inferior and dial was very hard to read.",38396,2
38396,Product was returned.,38396,2
38397,Sizing runs small buy one size larger than normal,38397,2
38398,looks great but the legs were a bit tight cutting into me.,38398,2
38399,The picture is very misleading.,38399,2
38399,The label says emerald green but shows a teal passport cover.,38399,2
38399,The actual item is indeed emerald green.,38399,2
38399,"Otherwise, the item came in on time, looks well made, does smell like real leather.",38399,2
38400,Comfortable but seams ripped after first wash,38400,2
38401,Looks like cheap granny fabric.,38401,2
38401,It seems to be sewn from the same bolt of spandex fabric that Jane Fonda used to wear in her videos.,38401,2
38401,Ha ha.,38401,2
38402,It's ok but I got a large and it fits my friend who is a small!,38402,2
38403,still haven't worn it yet it's too big,38403,2
38404,way too small for what is advertised,38404,2
38405,I ordered a size up but it's still way to small,38405,2
38406,BEAUTIFUL BUT TURNING GREEN,38406,2
38407,This swimsuit is absolutely amazing but if ur on the chesty side of life a large or xlarge should do the trick.,38407,2
38407,I ordered a medium n it fits like a small.,38407,2
38408,"Received these earlier than expected but when I opened the package, I realized the overalls were damp and smelled like chemicals.",38408,2
38408,Not pleased.,38408,2
38408,They were also too small.,38408,2
38409,I've had to replace this wallet.,38409,2
38409,The plastic compartments holding the cards broke making it much more difficult to close due to the scattered cards.,38409,2
38409,"I can see a use for this wallet for someone who doesn't carry more than 4 or 5 cards, and either lives a big city or travels a lot.",38409,2
38409,The RFID blocking technology seems like it would be a good fit for the latter.,38409,2
38409,"For someone like myself, who need to carry 6 or more cards, plus would like to be able to carry business cards, it's not a good fit.",38409,2
38410,This was product did not provide a desired shape for my dress.,38410,2
38410,It made it look very bulky.,38410,2
38411,I got the ring in today.,38411,2
38411,It's beautiful!,38411,2
38411,"BUT, IT HAS SKULLS ON IT.",38411,2
38411,I didn't look at the picture close enough to notice the 2 skulls and the description doesn't mention it!!!,38411,2
38411,"I definitely don't want an engagement ring with Skulls on it, unless I'm taking the ""untill death do us part"" quite literally...",38411,2
38412,It was very small I had ordered large but still very small,38412,2
38413,Feels like felt.,38413,2
38413,Had wide shoulders and small around the abdomen area.,38413,2
38413,Loose threads around the buttons.,38413,2
38413,Not pleased with this shirt.,38413,2
38413,Would not purchase again.,38413,2
38414,Smaller than expected,38414,2
38415,"Dress did turn body black, but that was an easy fix.",38415,2
38415,"However, dress came with a rip in the lace right in the top front so it couldn't be hidden.",38415,2
38415,Wass;t cost effective to return and wait was too long to order a replacement.,38415,2
38415,With a nicer sash and tulle filler skirt under the dress it would have looked nice though if I had been able to wear it.,38415,2
38416,Loved the look of the dress- wasn't able to try it on because the zipper wouldn't zip down so back it went.,38416,2
38416,Amazon required me to select how it fit to be able to leave a review but I don't know how it fit since I wasn't able to try it on.,38416,2
38416,I returned it to the seller with no problem.,38416,2
38416,"Shipping was quick, packaged nicely and I liked that it came with the belt as shown.",38416,2
38416,Hopefully mine was just a fluke dress but may want to order a back up if you need it asap like I did!,38416,2
38417,I got the marauders map phone case and I loved it but after a month the black part you put the phone in started cracking (and I have never even dropped this phone).,38417,2
38417,First it was just the edges but then the back started cracking more so currently it is held together by gorilla tape.,38417,2
38417,"For the price tho, what else can you expect.",38417,2
38418,"Very boxy, it didn't hang well.",38418,2
38418,"For reference, I'm a slim 5'10''.",38418,2
38418,"The length was ok, but wasn't flowy at all.",38418,2
38418,I'm returning it.,38418,2
38419,They were EXCELLENT shoes while they lasted which was less than 3 months.,38419,2
38419,I would not buy them again because I didn't even get a whole summer out of them.,38419,2
38419,If the company were to address their longevity I would have bought them every year though I usually get at least two summers out of sandals.,38419,2
38420,really really big in the legs,38420,2
38421,The lenses look great and fit perfect and for a great price.,38421,2
38421,The set I received were polarized and everything at far is perfect but there is a slight blur on electronics/lighted objects at close range.,38421,2
38421,I first noticed this while looking at my odometer while driving.,38421,2
38421,"I wasn't able to make out the display, strange.",38421,2
38421,Not sure if this is common or if I just got a defective set.,38421,2
38422,Returning.,38422,2
38422,I knew this wouldn't be a high quality dress but the fabric was thin and highlighted any added weight from the pregnancy.,38422,2
38422,I was hoping this would be my shower dress but definitely not.,38422,2
38423,Mine came with a lining so not see thru but it's quite tight for a large..,38423,2
38423,"I am normally a large, 1.78m tall and 38C bust.",38423,2
38423,I'm not sure I'll be wearing this dress.,38423,2
38424,Although it is a pretty romper the material is cheaply made and fell apart in the wash after the 4th wash.,38424,2
38425,I don't think the size meets the United States size standard.,38425,2
38426,Pretty but I am well endowed and the blouse will not lay gracefully.,38426,2
38427,The size is way too small.,38427,2
38428,"Cheap and junky, I don't think I will ever use this.",38428,2
38429,Has a really bad odor.,38429,2
38429,"I like the smell of leather, but the belt smells like....I don't know...dog food and leftover fish?",38429,2
38429,"I am going to try putting it in a ziplock bag with some baking soda, and then maybe shoving some dryer sheets or paper towels with fabreeze sprayed on them.",38429,2
38429,It's a very thick leather belt.,38429,2
38429,"It has a strange surface texture to it, but it seems like a good belt outside of the funky smell.",38429,2
38429,"I am not happy, but for what I paid, it's not worth it to send back.",38429,2
38430,"cheaply made, but at least it's cute.",38430,2
38431,Didn't like the fabric,38431,2
38432,"I ordered the red rose, one size.",38432,2
38432,Size it's ok.,38432,2
38432,But the color is not as the picture.,38432,2
38432,"Instead of white background, it's beige.",38432,2
38432,It makes the skirt looks dirty.,38432,2
38433,"The fabric is cheap, after few washes, the fabric started to look very bad.",38433,2
38433,I liked the fit as I have a flat stomach and decent arms.,38433,2
38433,It looks ok but it won't last long.,38433,2
38434,I got the light tan coffee color.,38434,2
38434,I gave it to charity.,38434,2
38434,Frumpy on.,38434,2
38434,Its a frumpy color though.,38434,2
38434,Crazy stuff going on with the stomach.,38434,2
38434,I don't need  visual distraction on my stomach as i am average weight.,38434,2
38435,Not what I expected.. your teenager would love them!,38435,2
38435,!,38435,2
38436,This dress has so much potential to be cute but the top is cheap metallic thin circles that won't lay flat so there is spots that have just white gaps as a result.,38436,2
38436,If it had been real sequin material this dress would probably be one of my favorites.,38436,2
38436,To bad.,38436,2
38437,Beautiful - but it came broken..,38437,2
38438,"Love the look, hate the fit.",38438,2
38438,I bought a pair of Ear Bags at the same time and they were a lot more comfortable than these.,38438,2
38438,I will not be wearing these.,38438,2
38439,"Plugged it in, and would not turn on.",38439,2
38439,Think the switch was defective so I returned the product.,38439,2
38439,Seemed kind of cheaply made for what you got.,38439,2
38440,They are almost entirely see through.,38440,2
38440,"I was hoping to wear them for a costume, but they are way too revealing to wear in public.",38440,2
38441,I bought the shoes to go to Tomorrowland.,38441,2
38441,They only lasted 1 night.,38441,2
38441,"After that, the On/Off switch of one of the shoes stop working.",38441,2
38441,"I led strip works and the battery too, but I can't turn them on with the little button.",38441,2
38441,35 dollars for something that lasts 1 day is not worth it.,38441,2
38442,Color on ball on top is peeling off.,38442,2
38442,"Turned my belly button green and since i can't wear fake metal, now hurts when i move.",38442,2
38442,Not as pretty as the picture as well.,38442,2
38442,"Honestly, i'm disappointed.",38442,2
38442,I should've bought something else.,38442,2
38442,Waste of money.,38442,2
38442,If you can wear fake metal go for it.,38442,2
38442,It's kinda cute i guess.,38442,2
38442,But don't wear it in water or sweat with it on.,38442,2
38442,Or else it'll turn you green and the color will peel off.,38442,2
38443,"Tacky, the zippers will probably break at most in a couple months-- if not in the first couple days like mine.",38443,2
38444,Very pretty but fits small,38444,2
38445,Way to small.,38445,2
38445,Couldn't even wear these.,38445,2
38446,"I normally wear a 40"" waist, so I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a size up.",38446,2
38446,"The waist is a good size, but the pants are comically long.",38446,2
38446,"If you have a 40"" waist and are 7 feet tall, these are the pants for you.",38446,2
38446,"Otherwise, expect to do some alterations, or just buy something else.",38446,2
38447,Not impressed but my niece will like it.,38447,2
38447,Pretty thin material,38447,2
38448,This shirt is very short.. the photo is deceiving.,38448,2
38448,I ordered a size larger than i normally wear because i wanted it to be slouchy and it's still too short.,38448,2
38448,Very disappointed because the short is really cute!,38448,2
38449,Broke after 1st use,38449,2
38450,returning,38450,2
38451,Nothing good to say,38451,2
38452,way too small...I wish I could buy a larger size...I like the material and all the pockets,38452,2
38453,Poor quality the belt is frayed at the terminal end.,38453,2
38454,Dress is shorter in the back then the front.,38454,2
38454,The front detail had strings coming out everywhere.... poorly made.,38454,2
38455,I am normally an XL but ordered a 3XL.,38455,2
38455,The bottoms fit perfectly but the top was 3 sizes too small.,38455,2
38455,"My body is proportional so the top should have been able to fit, really sucks that it didnt.",38455,2
38455,I'll keep the bottoms and have to shop at the mall for a plain black top to match.,38455,2
38455,Kinda a waste of money.,38455,2
38455,Really cute tho.,38455,2
38455,"I would recommend for girls with small breasts, no larger than a C cup",38455,2
38456,The dress I ordered and the dress that arrived were not the same.,38456,2
38456,See they looked similar but while I was expecting a burgundy I received a red.,38456,2
38456,"In addition while I believed from the picture that it was just going to be lace, came in a slightly more tacky beading.",38456,2
38456,The straps were the same material as straps used to hang and felt pretty cheap.,38456,2
38456,The dress was also surprisingly heavy.,38456,2
38456,The middle section is much longer than depicted and cover my entire stomach.,38456,2
38456,"It was long, as expected, but that seemed unusually long.",38456,2
38456,"After looking at the reviews I expected it to fit small, and so I ordered a size up.",38456,2
38456,"When it got here it was falling off of me, to no fault of the dress, just a tip if you plan on purchasing.",38456,2
38456,Overall it did not match my expectations.,38456,2
38457,It didn't last long in my house,38457,2
38458,I feel like a stripper when I put this on.,38458,2
38458,It's not what I expected it to be.,38458,2
38458,The material is thin and it fits like a glove.,38458,2
38458,I will keep it for role a role play night for my significant other.,38458,2
38458,I will not wear it in public.,38458,2
38459,Elastic doesn't stay on bracelet.,38459,2
38459,But they are still pretty to wear.,38459,2
38460,not like the picture,38460,2
38461,The look is cute.,38461,2
38461,However I did not like the material.,38461,2
38461,The picture doesn't reflect the true image of the dress.,38461,2
38462,"The fabric is ok, but the color is biege  not white",38462,2
38463,Kinda disappointed in these shoes.,38463,2
38463,The front is red but it turns into a bright orange at the back.,38463,2
38463,Really wish it was all red.,38463,2
38464,I ordered a 2X...It was ran very small.,38464,2
38464,Gave it to someone that wears a size large and it fit them perfectly.,38464,2
38464,"It was made well and really cute, but just sized WRONG.",38464,2
38465,"Weird fit, selves are too short.",38465,2
38466,"We purchased these in a size 6 for our 2 year old as well as the StarBay brand water shoes to use at our local splash pad, the ocean, and backyard water table.",38466,2
38466,"The opening at the ankles of the i play shoes is huge and the shoes don't stay on if you are in moving water or sandy areas (ocean, lake, etc).",38466,2
38466,They work great for a splash pad or for the back yard if you just want shoes that aren't going to get ruined in the water.,38466,2
38467,I don't like the fit at all.. the material is thin.,38467,2
38467,Will be returning,38467,2
38468,was expecing thinner material n cant fit either,38468,2
38469,Not to good,38469,2
38470,I hated it because it was too big.,38470,2
38470,"The fabric is thin, soft, matte spandex material.",38470,2
38470,Quite stretchy.,38470,2
38470,"It got gold zippers on the sides as ""pretend pockets"" accents.",38470,2
38470,"They suggested going a size higher, so I decided to get the XX-Large.",38470,2
38470,Big (or should I say XX Large)  mistake.,38470,2
38470,The dress was 2-3 sizes too big.,38470,2
38471,MUCH MUCH MUCH TOO small!!!,38471,2
38471,I must have misread the sizing chart.,38471,2
38471,"Cost almost more to return than to purchase, so I donated.",38471,2
38471,"Also, fabric very thin/see thru.",38471,2
38472,the rubber for behind your ear came off when i first tried it on.,38472,2
38472,it doesn't sit on my face probably a bit twisted to the right.,38472,2
38472,"guess the saying is true, cheap thing not good and good thing not cheap.",38472,2
38473,too tight,38473,2
38474,quality is fine fit is much smaller than it should be,38474,2
38475,They don't have a band.,38475,2
38475,You have to stick your ear into the mitts.,38475,2
38475,I didn't realize that at the time of purchase.,38475,2
38475,The don't stay on.,38475,2
38475,They will drop off.,38475,2
38475,"Some what of an inconvenience walking, in the cold.",38475,2
38475,Having to deal with trying to keep your ears warm.,38475,2
38476,Flowers are glued on....,38476,2
38476,Came off instantly and also the dress itself too low cut and the straps are not adjustable...,38476,2
38476,Returned item,38476,2
38477,"Fits true to size, BUT IT IS SEE THROUGH!",38477,2
38477,You will have to wear shorts etc under it!,38477,2
38478,I wish it was bigger!,38478,2
38478,:(,38478,2
38479,Purchased this garment for St Patrick's Day event.,38479,2
38479,"It arrived on time, but stuffed in a small plastic bag.",38479,2
38479,The garment had major wrinkles.,38479,2
38479,"I washed the blouse in cold water, rinsed in fabric softener, and dried on low setting, and it still remained very, very wrinkled and unwearable.",38479,2
38479,"I used a steam iron and most wrinkles disappeared, but the fabric wrinkles very easily.",38479,2
38479,Ironing it wasn't easy.,38479,2
38479,"Also, the tie does not tie at a natural waist line, more like six inches above and it is a thin piece of fabric.",38479,2
38479,"I normally wear a regular size 16, but based on size chart ordered a 16 W or XXXLG.",38479,2
38479,The fit is good.,38479,2
38479,I am posting three pictures for others.,38479,2
38479,Picture (1) right out of the bag; (2) after being washed/dried; and (3) after ironing.,38479,2
38479,"The fabric is suppose to be a synthetic, but it clearly isn't one that looks fresh.",38479,2
38479,"I will keep the garment, as the event I purchased it for is too near.",38479,2
38479,"Otherwise, this blouse would definitely be returned.",38479,2
38480,"These are really cute and I would love them, except the star's post was slightly beaten up and chipped upon arrival and without the silver plating I can't wear them.",38480,2
38480,"I'm allergic to most alloys, so that was disappointing.",38480,2
38480,"If you're not sensitive, then you'll probably love them.",38480,2
38481,I read in reviews that it runs small so I ordered one size larger.,38481,2
38481,Should have ordered 2 sizes larger to be comfortable.,38481,2
38481,Also I had to wash it twice to remove a funky petroleum smell.,38481,2
38481,It's still faintly there but I think it will fade completely after the next washing.,38481,2
38481,FYI: gentle cycle recommended.,38481,2
38482,Too small.,38482,2
38482,Seam ripped easily.,38482,2
38483,Ok. Not all the same color though.,38483,2
38483,All the finish came off of the big ones.,38483,2
38484,Is not the best quality.,38484,2
38484,I guess it's OK for the price.,38484,2
38484,Seems very roughly put together.,38484,2
38485,It's not long enough for woman with booty like myself Looks nice as a long top but feels more on the low end/ budget.,38485,2
38486,This product runs small.,38486,2
38486,If you wear a medium then you should order a large unless you like things extremely tight and smothering.,38486,2
38487,"was not what we expected - it was 'cheesy' looking, unfortunately.",38487,2
38487,"Then, it was going to cost more to send it back than it was worth.",38487,2
38487,Not cool.,38487,2
38488,It's too small and too expensive.,38488,2
38488,My sister bought one to take to Disneyland in case of rain and hers is a little larger and cost $1.50.,38488,2
38489,Every drop of snow sticks to the gloves because of the fleece.,38489,2
38489,Would only be good for colder areas that have no snow,38489,2
38490,It's cute and all but I had it for like a week and it already broke,38490,2
38491,The emblem on the back of my cross isn't straight.,38491,2
38491,"Considering I purchased this item to display my faith, I find it very, very offensive.",38491,2
38491,"Also, there are several spacing issues regarding the beads and the knots.",38491,2
38491,"In some places, they are tight, but in others, there is a very visible spacing between the bead and the knot.",38491,2
38491,"Again, I am offended.",38491,2
38492,They were kinda sheer.,38492,2
38492,Umm no,38492,2
38493,the color is off .I have a large I need a 1x,38493,2
38494,"This is a really cute shirt and I saw shirt because it is thin material, I always get compliments when I wear it however the elbow pads do not sit in the right place, I have to constantly adjust the elbow pads so they sit in somewhat of the correct place.",38494,2
38494,If the elbow pads were sewn in the correct spot it would be a much better shirt,38494,2
38495,2 sizes smaller then all my others.,38495,2
38496,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed the look, feel, and useable space.",38496,2
38496,But our passprots did not fit in the little mesh sleeve that the picture shows.,38496,2
38496,One of them ripped at the edge while trying to fit it.,38496,2
38496,I am returning and looking for others,38496,2
38497,Cheap cheap quality,38497,2
38498,"Omg the quality of the lace is very rough poor workmanship is very bad ..also like other customers mentioned in previous rewiews rums very small specially the sleves
Never purchase from this vendor again",38498,2
38499,These fit really nicely but the color and pattern were nothing like the picture or what I expected.,38499,2
38500,I threw them away.,38500,2
38500,Did not like the collar.,38500,2
38500,It was too small.,38500,2
38500,Very uncomfortable.,38500,2
38500,Material was not that great but you get what you pay for.,38500,2
38500,"If the collar was a bit less tight, I would use it.",38500,2
38501,"Fit is as expected, but material isn't as night as I would have liked it to be.",38501,2
38501,"I returned, but if you are tall (I'm 5'10) I wouldn't recommend.",38501,2
38502,"Broke easily, but very cute shirt.",38502,2
38503,Way too small!,38503,2
38504,Nice quality but size was for jrs.,38504,2
38505,Old and too dried out to use,38505,2
38506,Not a fan.,38506,2
38506,"The empty bag itself was so heavy, I wasn't sure I'd even want to put much in it.",38506,2
38506,"It's loose and floppy, there's no support in the bag, not even in the bottom.",38506,2
38506,"The straps on the sides are awkward and stick out and if you tighten them, it throws off the rest of the bag.",38506,2
38506,It's just not a good bag unfortunately.,38506,2
38506,I'm glad this had free returns so I don't have to pay to send it back.,38506,2
38507,It's much smaller than a 1/3 carat is.,38507,2
38507,"They are pretty for the price it just felt almost false advertised,",38507,2
38508,Falling apart after VERY little use,38508,2
38509,Fit like Juniors instead of Misses,38509,2
38510,"Wanted no pockets, searched for no pockets, reviews and answered questions said no pockets.",38510,2
38510,"They have pockets, if that is what you want then great, not what I wanted.",38510,2
38511,The white teeth of the shark are a bit flimsy.,38511,2
38511,I plan on stiffening them.,38511,2
38511,The strap is a gold chain that makes it look cheap and uncomfortable on shoulder.,38511,2
38511,I plan on changing the strap to match the suit.,38511,2
38512,Bought two pairs to save on shipping.,38512,2
38512,First pair fell apart after one week.,38512,2
38512,Second pair holding up so far.,38512,2
38512,Heel seems to breakdown quick.,38512,2
38513,The dress didn't look anything like it does in the picture.,38513,2
38513,"I ordered 6 of them for my bridesmaids,  and they don't fit right.",38513,2
38513,"The part on the top is really tight, and the color is lighter than in the picture.",38513,2
38513,I have to get them all taylored now because they don't fit right.,38513,2
38514,My little guy was so excited about these shoes and they fit really good.,38514,2
38514,But the lights stopped working on one shoe in less that 24 hours.,38514,2
38514,Will be returning and trying another pair.,38514,2
38515,Very see-through.,38515,2
38515,Low quality.,38515,2
38516,"its small and not true to size , so disappointed with my purchase",38516,2
38517,"not the biggest fan of this suit, the mid section is kind of short, and i would not describe myself as having a long torso.",38517,2
38517,"Overall, weird fitting.",38517,2
38518,i GOT THIS BLOUSE TODAY  WAY TO SMALL  AND I GOT XLG,38518,2
38519,"It's definitely not as big as pictured, and the blue color is a little off (not the bright royal blue as pictured in their images, I held up a blue sweater I'm wearing so you can see the contrast of blue hues).... also, really stiff; it's hard to fit things in there, and hard to get things out due to the stiffness.",38519,2
38520,Fits like an small,38520,2
38521,its not 100% cotton !,38521,2
38522,Runs small and very very thin,38522,2
38523,for the price I was expecting better quality.,38523,2
38523,Can't put outside because the swing is made out of cardboard.,38523,2
38523,Have to only use for the one night and then bring back in the house.,38523,2
38524,Buyer beware apparently there is no way to know which manufacturer you will get your dress from.,38524,2
38524,I only decided to purchase because the average reviews seemed to indicate that the dress ran according to size.,38524,2
38524,Still I ordered somewhat larger.,38524,2
38524,Mine came from China which means that the dress is no where close to size.,38524,2
38524,"On a positive note, I guess I can always donate it to my 12 year old niece.",38524,2
38525,I wear a size 10 clothing so I ordered this in a 12 and it was way too big and it took me a couple of tries to figure out how the top should go.,38525,2
38525,It may have been ok if it had fit.,38525,2
38526,sizing is extremely small!,38526,2
38526,!,38526,2
38527,Just ok,38527,2
38528,It is really warm and really long.,38528,2
38529,I would have given them a higher rating but they didn't come with a charger.,38529,2
38530,Too small,38530,2
38531,Not as flushing or comfortable very baggy,38531,2
38532,Just got this dress in the mail today and I am sadly disappointed with it.,38532,2
38532,"I ordered another Beachcoco knee length maternity dress that was of excellent quality, but this one just doesn't seem like it's going to stand up.",38532,2
38532,"The material is VERY thin (read: see-through), and it doesn't seem like it will withstand much more than this one season, if that.",38532,2
38532,"Only plus is that it is flattering and true to size, if not a bit small in the top.",38532,2
38532,"I will keep it, and plan to wear a cami underneath to solve the see-through issue.",38532,2
38532,Might need a slip for the bottom half too.,38532,2
38532,Overall I don't have high hopes for this dress.,38532,2
38532,I'll update after I wear and wash it to let you know how it holds up.,38532,2
38533,It feels like I'm wearing a shirt backwards.,38533,2
38533,I guess I'll donate it.,38533,2
38534,Waistband is not strong enough!,38534,2
38535,Top was too small on top,38535,2
38536,"Not as long as I had expected, very thin material.",38536,2
38537,it would be better if it were alittle bigger,38537,2
38538,Do not buy if you are anything less than a C cup!,38538,2
38538,This would be a cute suit if not for the molded cups that make it completely unwearable for anyone small chested.,38538,2
38538,The bottom coverage is also much less than I would prefer.,38538,2
38538,Returning.,38538,2
38539,It came ripped.,38539,2
38539,Still looks cute but I have to fix the hole.,38539,2
38540,Not for me!,38540,2
38541,Really like the bracelet but some is tiny sets fell out in a few weeks.,38541,2
38541,Used the chain to make a different one with cross that I have had for years and sets have never fallen out.,38541,2
38542,returned - did not suit my purpose,38542,2
38543,Runs small.,38543,2
38543,The bum part is somewhat high cut.,38543,2
38543,The sewn in cups were nice however since I'm small chested they made me look lopsided and lumpy.,38543,2
38543,The quality is nice and the sheer is nice however it might not be for you if you have a bigger bum and smaller chest.,38543,2
38544,Bought the tribal-aqua option.,38544,2
38544,LOVE the colors but the cut was so sloppy.,38544,2
38544,"They had cut the fabric crooked, so the pattern goes in a crazy diagonal instead of straight.",38544,2
38544,It's very obvious at the waist where the fabric is gathered in.,38544,2
38544,"No way I could wear this without getting cross-eyes :) (the pattern is bold, after all, so mistakes really show up!).",38544,2
38544,"If they can figure out how to cut the pieces out straight before sewing the dress together, I would love to buy this.",38544,2
38544,"Also, be aware that if you are small/petite like me, this runs large.",38544,2
38544,"I think so many people complained to these Asian companies for so long that their clothing was too small, and now these companies are no longer offering true small sizes since most people don't need them.",38544,2
38544,"In many cases now, the smallest size offered by these companies is way too baggy on me.",38544,2
38544,"I am 5' 3"", 32B bra, 27"" waist, 38.5"" hip.",38544,2
38544,So not tiny.,38544,2
38544,I would even be an M with some American clothing companies.,38544,2
38544,PLEASE bring small sizes back.,38544,2
38545,Material is weird and always staticky no matter how much bounce is used.,38545,2
38545,Not what I was expecting at all based on what it shows.,38545,2
38546,Cheaply made.,38546,2
38547,"Ordered a small, but feels like an extra small.",38547,2
38547,I 'll wear it but have to stretch it out,38547,2
38548,The draw string sucks and they sag (because the draw string is too thin and won't hold them up) I don't even wear them.,38548,2
38549,Beautiful dress.,38549,2
38549,Runs so small it could zip past my boobs.,38549,2
38549,I usually wear a medium so I ordered a large and won't fit.,38549,2
38550,Returning it don't like how it looks in person or on,38550,2
38551,"As soon as I put a pair in the stem for my ear broke, was pissed",38551,2
38552,loved the look but frame cracked within 1 day.,38552,2
38553,didn't fit well,38553,2
38554,was exchanged with no problem,38554,2
38555,This top was nothing like I was expecting.,38555,2
38555,It was very voluminous and the straps very long.,38555,2
38555,The back was very open and gaping.,38555,2
38555,The fabric reminded me of a parachute or shower curtain.,38555,2
38555,Very disappointing,38555,2
38556,I did not love this wallet.,38556,2
38556,"The manger closure was not strong enough to keep the wallet shut once I put all my items in it, so I was constantly trying to re-close it while I was shopping so that my son wouldn't be able to empty out all of the contents.",38556,2
38556,"The color was beautiful and the leather was nice, but overall I just didn't find it worth the money.",38556,2
38556,I am in the process of returning it.,38556,2
38557,largest you had........still too small...........gave to the wife!,38557,2
38557,!,38557,2
38558,Wrong color.,38558,2
38558,It is definitely not red.,38558,2
38559,Sizes run very small.,38559,2
38559,Ordered in 1 size larger than size chart suggested & still can't wear it.,38559,2
38560,Shirt is narrow and tight.,38560,2
38560,Order one size up if your going to purchase the shirt.,38560,2
38561,"I am 5'3"" and 118 lb.",38561,2
38561,"Normally, I'm a size 5 so I tried the US M/ ASIA XL based on reviews suggesting the pants were on the small side.",38561,2
38561,But I have 3 inches to spare in the waistline (which sits comfortably at hip level) of these cargos.,38561,2
38561,I suggest that people with straight figures like me (small hips/ not much waist)  stick with your usual size.,38561,2
38561,Update: I spent $11 to return the pants for a US S/ ASIA XL.,38561,2
38561,I can't tell that the US S is any smaller and the waist measures 34 inches (?!),38561,2
38561,with my measuring tape.,38561,2
38561,This company does quick turnarounds on returns but I won't pay the money to do it again.,38561,2
38562,Tennis bracelet was smaller than what was said in the advertising of the bracelet the size stated 2.0 ct and when I  sent it to the checkout section it showed a smaller size.,38562,2
38562,Not impressed.,38562,2
38563,"I ordered a royal blue and was given what looked like a navy, which is a lot lighter.",38563,2
38563,"So either I was sent the wrong color of shirt, or it appears different in the photo.",38563,2
38563,"I can't send it back as I purchased it to wear for a baby shower in two days, so I'm kind of stuck.",38563,2
38563,"Because of the mix up or difference in color, I'm giving it a two.",38563,2
38563,"If it would have came as expected, I would give a five for fit, and quality.",38563,2
38563,"As for the shirt itself, this was my second time ordering.",38563,2
38563,I love the fit.,38563,2
38563,"It is nice and loose around the arms, but not huge.",38563,2
38563,It also comes down on the arm like a T-shirt would but looks very dressy.,38563,2
38563,It's a longer shirt that works very well for my longer torso.,38563,2
38564,It just did not fit right I throw  it in the garbage and call it waste of time and lost,38564,2
38565,I didn't like how the yoke/neckline matched up,38565,2
38566,The elastic straps to put the wings on and the elastic loops for your fingers were too small for most adults.,38566,2
38566,The straps ended up breaking and I had to cut them off and sew the wings to my shirt to wear them.,38566,2
38566,I also had to add something bigger to the loops that my fingers could fit through (I used some key chain rings).,38566,2
38567,The quality of the top is very poor.,38567,2
38567,I suspect this particular style with all the holes wouldn't survive more than a few washings.,38567,2
38567,I ordered two of these.,38567,2
38567,"Be aware that some are Prime (free return, so no problem with the other one I ordered) and others are not.",38567,2
38567,This colour was not Prime.,38567,2
38567,I wound up getting a 40% refund and donating the top to the Thirft store.,38567,2
38567,Better than nothing - I'd have paid more to return it than what I would get in a full refund.,38567,2
38567,It was frustrating but at least customer service worked with me for some kind of compensation.,38567,2
38567,I would go up at least two sizes if not three with this top.,38567,2
38567,I went up 2 sizes (I'm a medium but large busted) and the XL would've fit me if I was about 3 cup sizes smaller in the bust.,38567,2
38568,too large,38568,2
38569,The only thing that CREEPED ME OUT is that I think my locket had been returned.,38569,2
38569,"It had a sheet o paper in it(which I was fine with) but the fact that it said ""I love you it's a secret"" made me think of all the women that died in a criminal minds episode.",38569,2
38569,If that is something that is in every locket fine but it was not in the description ANYWHERE!,38569,2
38569,I currently have it in my jewelry box hoping that one day I can get over the fact that it had a love note that seemed to be written my a 14 year old to his secret girlfriend.,38569,2
38569,I would post a photo of the scrap of paper but my fianc was so weirded out by it he tossed it out.,38569,2
38570,Too short.,38570,2
38570,It's a knee length.,38570,2
38570,Not like shown in the picture.,38570,2
38570,And it's a very see through.,38570,2
38571,"I'm impressed, this is a very good belt and was sized correctly so it fit perfectly.",38571,2
38571,sturdier then my last belt which had metal that would bend *I lost the pin because of that* It looks good.,38571,2
38571,"REVIEW EDIT--- nope I was wrong, after only a few uses the buckle pin falls off like other cheap belts.",38571,2
38571,"Luckily I found it, and will try to bend it to hold better but I don't expect much now.",38571,2
38572,This was a very awkward piece of clothing.,38572,2
38572,It was not off the shoulder at all.,38572,2
38572,It was just a large neck that draped in a weird way.,38572,2
38572,The fabric was heavy and extremely polyester like.,38572,2
38572,I was hoping for it to look even just a little like the picture but that was not the case at all.,38572,2
38573,Too short!!,38573,2
38573,"Your dress will be hanging , every ugly!",38573,2
38573,!,38573,2
38574,I normally wear a 16 but the XX-L was too small.,38574,2
38574,Pretty dress just wouldn't fit!,38574,2
38575,I love the colors and they way the bracelet design is set up.,38575,2
38575,When I received the product and put it on( I have small wrist) the bracelet broke and still have yet to put it together tried several times.,38575,2
38576,"Material was great, but the cups are just like the other reviews stated, oddly placed in the middle of the dress.",38576,2
38576,There is no way to actually get them aligned to your chest properly.,38576,2
38576,It is too small in the top.,38576,2
38576,I ordered and 8 and I'm usually and 6 to 8 dress size.,38576,2
38576,I'm returning.,38576,2
38577,To slow takes 2 hours to charge from 20% to 100!,38577,2
38577,!,38577,2
38578,"Pretty and convincing, buy rose gold finish started fading after two weeks.",38578,2
38579,This jacket was less than impressive in person.,38579,2
38579,It looked cheap and had loose threads everywhere.,38579,2
38579,I returned it.,38579,2
38580,"Not like picture, not a nice round slope to the longer part of the shirt.",38580,2
38580,"Back was long, front was short.",38580,2
38580,Separated by seem.,38580,2
38580,Also way too big using the size chart.,38580,2
38580,I returned it.,38580,2
38580,It was a nice material and Arrived quickly.,38580,2
38581,"I went out of my way to find a seller for this item that had the extended sizes, and bought based on their sizing chart.",38581,2
38581,"I can put it on, but it's incredibly short (it barely comes down party waist), and so small that I can't get the sides to meet across chest.",38581,2
38581,"I gave it 2 stars, only because I think it's probably a perfectly fine product if you're short, slender, and order 2 to 3 sizes up from what the chart says you need.",38581,2
38582,Material is oddly thin.,38582,2
38582,Feels more like a blouse than a blazer.,38582,2
38582,returning.,38582,2
38583,Good Halloween costume - :(,38583,2
38584,Fit true to size.,38584,2
38584,"Warm, good material.",38584,2
38584,I did not like how I looked in it.,38584,2
38585,Bought two of these t shirts in large and love them!,38585,2
38585,"Decided to buy two more in large and got the order, these new shirts are considerably longer than the tshirts in my first order.",38585,2
38585,"Very disappointing, if you buy a  particular size, it should always be the same, no matter when you order it.",38585,2
38585,"Will not buy from this company again, cannot expect consistency.",38585,2
38586,It is a cheap product.,38586,2
38586,The problems is that it looks and feels cheap.,38586,2
38586,These kind of caps are expected to be easily adaptable to any shape of head with no problem.,38586,2
38586,"Not this one, Some kind of flaps form at the sides, as if there was extra material; simply not well designed.",38586,2
38587,Fits perfectly.,38587,2
38587,"Jewels fall off, and is see through.",38587,2
38587,DO NOT BUY!!!!,38587,2
38587,!,38587,2
38588,Too small!!,38588,2
38588,!,38588,2
38589,Ordered an xxl and it fit like a small,38589,2
38590,Looked like a trash bag on.,38590,2
38590,Not very flattering.,38590,2
38591,I am 4'10 and this dress was very someone much taller and much more filled.,38591,2
38591,"It looked awful on me, but great on my roomate.",38591,2
38592,This shirt is far from being red and navy striped.,38592,2
38592,It is hot pink stripes.. not even close to red in any lighting.,38592,2
38592,Hot pink.,38592,2
38593,"I love the quality of these, and the top clamps are great BUT the bottom adjustment clamp is terrible.",38593,2
38593,It digs into my ankle and is very comfortable.,38593,2
38593,I have a different set and that clasp is higher up so it can lay flat against your leg.,38593,2
38593,"But these have that clasp at the bottom, which is visible and stabs me.",38593,2
38593,Would not buy these again unless this flaw is fixed.,38593,2
38594,This is aweful!!!,38594,2
38594,There is no give at all!!!,38594,2
38594,You can't move in this it's not moveable material.,38594,2
38594,I'm a small person I weigh 103 lbs.,38594,2
38594,"5'2"" and this suit cut into my bottom like it was a thong!!!",38594,2
38594,"Disappointed because it's really cute so uncomfortable, my husband was like, ah, you can't wear that!!",38594,2
38594,Haha!!!,38594,2
38594,We got a good laugh anyway,38594,2
38595,"Pretty, but super cheap.",38595,2
38596,"Nice graphics, but super awkwardly shaped",38596,2
38597,"stopped working second day, charged never worked only first day",38597,2
38598,"Snap closures are very poor quality one is broken already after wearing it one time..and the leather has a really ""rank"" oder to it.",38598,2
38599,It fits extremely small as a xxl it should of been labeled a LG instead,38599,2
38600,Looks beautiful on the model.,38600,2
38600,Doesn't look like that in person.,38600,2
38600,:(,38600,2
38601,"Ordered medium size, but toooo big.",38601,2
38601,Looks like a X-large.,38601,2
38602,"did not like the material, not soft fleece, very polyester feel.",38602,2
38603,Cute but much to small digs deeply into bottom of my body..it hurts,38603,2
38604,"This necklace is adorable and looks great, sadly it broke the one and only day I wore it.",38604,2
38605,poor quality,38605,2
38606,The shoulder area is very akward.,38606,2
38606,The shoulders are too high.,38606,2
38606,Would need altered in order to make it work.,38606,2
38607,terrible material .,38607,2
38607,would not actually wear it .,38607,2
38608,I bought the dress one size bigger and it didn't fit.,38608,2
38609,"They sent me the wrong color, twice.",38609,2
38609,Not happy.,38609,2
38609,"I bought four different colors and two are ok quality, however, it does look extremely legit.",38609,2
38609,"If you want one of these bracelets, I suggest buying three or four -- because half of them will be broken.",38609,2
38609,"They were fast to contact me back which was nice, but neglected to read the email because they sent the wrong colors twice after I easily described everything I needed and PAID for.",38609,2
38610,Started falling apart during first time being worn.,38610,2
38610,Insoles aren't even attached so the bottom of shoe is just a rubber piece.,38610,2
38611,Had to return.,38611,2
38611,Very tiny jacket.,38611,2
38612,"Turns out ""women's medium"" in Japan is like a child's small.",38612,2
38612,"Very disappointed, this was a gift for my sister.",38612,2
38612,If it had not been such a ridiculous size I think it would be a good quality sweatshirt.,38612,2
38613,"For some reason, my wrist would break out in a rash when I'd wear this for more than a day.",38613,2
38613,I ended up just making my own mala.,38613,2
38614,I finally received this dress after an expected very long wait.,38614,2
38614,"It arrived very wrinkled, and smelling a bit chemically.",38614,2
38614,"No big deal, I washed it on a gentle cycle and hung to dry.",38614,2
38614,"The wrinkles came out, so that was good.",38614,2
38614,"The hem either totally unraveled, or it wasn't hemmed to begin with and I didn't notice before washing.",38614,2
38614,"Either way, that was unacceptable.",38614,2
38614,"The bottom green part is a nice soft flowing skirt, feels like rayon.",38614,2
38614,"The top is harder to describe, a very sheer sheeting kind of fabric with embroidery on the bottom.",38614,2
38614,I wish it was the same as the skirt.,38614,2
38614,It has a stiffness to it.,38614,2
38614,"I wear a 10, I ordered the xxl, which is the biggest size offered.",38614,2
38614,"The arm holes are fine, and I can't deal small openings, so that's a positive, I'm a 36 barely c, I wish it was a little roomier across the bust, but that part is wearable.",38614,2
38614,"The cap sleeves are another story, there is barely enough fabric to go across, so as long as my arms are down by my sides it's fine, but I can't raise them...at all.",38614,2
38614,"I love a fluttery cap sleeve, so these are beyond a disappointment.",38614,2
38614,"Ill try splitting them down the center, but most likely will have to remove them in order to salvage this dress.",38614,2
38614,"Aside from the hem, the stitching is good in the rest of this dress.",38614,2
38614,"All things considered, a poor buy and a big disappointment.",38614,2
38614,"I can't recommend, and wouldn't purchase from this company again.",38614,2
38615,Not very good quality.,38615,2
38615,Looks extremely cheaply made.,38615,2
38615,Almost like a plastic bag just draped over you.,38615,2
38615,And the design isn't very good either.,38615,2
38615,Looks like a faded iron on.,38615,2
38615,Had to return it.,38615,2
38616,"It is nice, but alot of the jewels fell off.",38616,2
38616,It also runs a little small.,38616,2
38617,I like the look and feel of it I think it would be cute if I had a flat chest so I could get it on.,38617,2
38617,The slit in the side is a little too high.,38617,2
38617,Will be returning it.,38617,2
38618,I was disappointed.,38618,2
38618,I don't love these for the price.,38618,2
38618,I was really hoping they would be more realistic but they do not look like stones at all.,38618,2
38618,I am not sure what they are made of but they look plastic and like something a child might wear (sans the diamonds) the stones are dull and there is no luster.,38618,2
38618,I would say it is not because the stones are blue as I have other earrings that look better than these.,38618,2
38618,They did arrive very fast and I was impressed with that fact.,38618,2
38618,Would not buy or order jewelry from them again.,38618,2
38619,Ended up returning this because it was larger than expected.,38619,2
38619,I was expecting a more fitted look and the material wasn't very soft.,38619,2
38620,Nice for the price.,38620,2
38620,It tangles very easily.,38620,2
38621,The color chipped off of several the first time wearing them.,38621,2
38622,These are cute by so very small.,38622,2
38623,"There was no ""push up "" in the suit.",38623,2
38623,Otherwise not a bad suit..,38623,2
38624,It didn't fit very well and some of the sewing was off.,38624,2
38625,Too small,38625,2
38626,2 stars it's cute I loved the idea but cheap materials.,38626,2
38626,Wore it once and it broke already on the latch.,38626,2
38627,The top fit fine but after the second time I wore it the fasten broke.,38627,2
38627,Very disappointing.,38627,2
38628,While the price was cheap so was the product.,38628,2
38629,Item that arrived was more of a dark reddish mauve and definitely not the bright 'passion' pink as advertised.,38629,2
38629,It was promptly returned.,38629,2
38630,I ordered an XL and the shirt is still way too small and too short.,38630,2
38630,I'll probably give it away.,38630,2
38631,"They are lovely by themselves, but made for a large wrist.",38631,2
38631,"Could not keep the hair tie on the bracelet, so that was frustrating.",38631,2
38631,It kept popping off.,38631,2
38631,I felt like the bracelet track needed to be deeper.,38631,2
38632,"Very small, more like a garment from China.",38632,2
38632,"Other than that, they are soft and seem to be made okay.",38632,2
38632,Good thing they fit my teenager or I would have to return them.,38632,2
38633,I would usually wear XS but I got the smallest size which was S. The bottom fitted me good however the top i was a bit too big & there's no way of adjusting it tighter.,38633,2
38633,"It's a nice looking bikini but because of the fit, it wasn't worth the price.",38633,2
38634,They started to fall off my head and I reached out and caught them before reached the floor.,38634,2
38634,The frame snapped in my hand to my disbelief.,38634,2
38635,This is not like the picture.,38635,2
38635,Very cheap looking and poor craftsmanship,38635,2
38636,Fell apart pretty quickly.,38636,2
38636,I think if the pearl could move around it wouldn't have broken after a week.,38636,2
38637,Way too small,38637,2
38638,Stone fell out after a couple of weeks.,38638,2
38639,The fit of this bathing suit was super weird.,38639,2
38639,The top was a little big and the bottom was wayyyy to small.,38639,2
38639,I am normally a medium but ordered a size large based on comments/suggestions and the bottom of this bikini was just TINY.,38639,2
38639,I loved the style and the print of the fabric but there was just no way this was going to look flattering on me.,38639,2
38640,"I'm 5'5"", 175 lbs and I got the Medium.",38640,2
38640,"The green is more of an army green which isn't bad, just not what's on the picture.",38640,2
38640,"Also, it was impossible to wear the top the way the model has it tied without being taped into it.",38640,2
38640,I tried tying it several different ways and the seam on the top has already started to tear.,38640,2
38640,The bottoms fit more like a granny panty instead of a snug high waist.,38640,2
38640,"And as others have said, the material is thin, I would not be able to get this wet.",38640,2
38640,Its not HORRIBLE considering it was $14 but I will be returning it.,38640,2
38641,"I love this swimsuit and am going to order another one - but mine was not sewn correctly, on the top one side was not a triangle, it looked like a mistake was made when this was sewn and it wasn't properly inspected.",38641,2
38641,Hopefully the next one i order is sewn correctly.,38641,2
38641,It's a small error but still doesn't look right.,38641,2
38641,This swimsuit also runs small - order 1 size up.,38641,2
38642,The hand is really HUGE!,38642,2
38642,"it does't look good, it's vulgar :/
The quality is ok.",38642,2
38643,Very cheap looking and bad construction.,38643,2
38643,Its a cheap material and the way it was sewn makes it looked bunched on the seams when it is laying flat.,38643,2
38643,I bought this and another bikini on Amazon last minute before a trip.,38643,2
38643,I ended up taking the other one with me and this I just threw away.,38643,2
38643,Its 20 bucks so I guess you get what you pay for.,38643,2
38644,It did not fit.,38644,2
38644,It was a whole size too small.,38644,2
38644,I suggest ordering 1 size up from what your child usually wears.,38644,2
38644,"I will say, however, that the color was exactly what I expected and wanted.",38644,2
38644,"The tie is not a clip on, it is an elastic ""necklace"" that will go around the neck and sit under the collar.",38644,2
38644,My son was excited about that as he is not fond of the clip on sitting on his neck.,38644,2
38645,fabric was very nice but it just would not stay closed all the way down ... runs too small for a woman with curves ...,38645,2
38646,"This looks so colorful and vibrant online, but isn't in real life.",38646,2
38647,cute but did not fit at all,38647,2
38648,"look cheap, wore once",38648,2
38649,Slim cut.,38649,2
38649,Doesn't swing or hang like you'd expect from picture.,38649,2
38649,Sleeves are really tight.,38649,2
38649,Doesn't lay like picture shows.,38649,2
38650,"I first had the xs size which was perfect except too tight on the stomach (couldn't breath), so I changed it to an s : it's fine on the stomach but too large on the breast and back.",38650,2
38650,So disappointed.,38650,2
38650,"I am 60,7"" tall and I weigh 106 pounds.",38650,2
38650,The fabric looks good.,38650,2
38651,Looks nothing like the picture...The material is very cheap and highly resembles a Party City costume...that thin nylon material that imitation silk scarves are made of.,38651,2
38651,Thank God for free returns.,38651,2
38652,"poor quality, white trim fuzz was all over the outfit when i took it out of the package.",38652,2
38652,will be returning it.,38652,2
38653,The shirt fits a little too tight and not long enough,38653,2
38654,The outfit was SUPER CUTE!!,38654,2
38654,"But the size I got, which is my size MEDIUM, was too damn small!!",38654,2
38654,An X-Large would have probably fit me as desired.,38654,2
38654,I WAS SO PISSED!!,38654,2
38654,!,38654,2
38655,smaller than I thought they would be,38655,2
38656,This item was way too small for me.,38656,2
38656,The style is on point.,38656,2
38656,I have ordered up a couple of sizes and will update my review once I see how the new dress fits.,38656,2
38657,Too small,38657,2
38658,This ships from China and therefor the sizes are very small.,38658,2
38658,And then when dried in the dryer it will drastically shrink.,38658,2
38658,Fortunately it still fits my girlfriend so there's no need to return it.,38658,2
38658,"It is a very cool design, however.",38658,2
38658,If you get this I would definitely go one or two sizes up from normal.,38658,2
38659,"These are the style that go to the middle of the thigh, not the ones that sit higher.",38659,2
38660,Too small,38660,2
38661,"Nice fabric and fit, very poor workmanship.",38661,2
38661,"After 1st wearing, the hem of one leg completely unraveled.",38661,2
38662,"Really, someone has to unify sizes.",38662,2
38662,Our grandson wears anywhere from 24 mo to 2t-3t and this 3t was so TIGHT in the waist band area that they would not pull up!,38662,2
38663,somewhat small,38663,2
38664,It changed the original color,38664,2
38665,"This bag is so cute and has tons of space and pockets, but the strap broke about one week into using it!",38665,2
38665,"The hooks aren't very strong, and my fixes aren't seeming to help!",38665,2
38666,It was nice however the size is little bit large.,38666,2
38667,Pineapple is like plastic on the shirt?,38667,2
38667,Hem was crooked...,38667,2
38668,Fabric and workman's ship was excellent but the size was at least 2 sizes off even after measuring the person.,38668,2
38669,Very short,38669,2
38670,So cute!,38670,2
38670,But broke when I was trying to put it on.,38670,2
38671,Should of gotten a large because it's a Lil tight but I think its too late to exchange so I'll wear it once and buy another one but in a bigger size,38671,2
38672,This cardigan looks like a child's size cardigan.,38672,2
38672,The back was way shorter than the front of the cardigan.,38672,2
38672,It looks nothing like the picture when on.,38672,2
38673,It looks cute but expected it to be bigger.,38673,2
38674,It is difficult to rate this jacket because everything is great about the jacket except the buttons.,38674,2
38674,"They are very loosely sewn on, so they wobble/flop, and it looks terrible.",38674,2
38674,"Also, I imagine they would pull off very quickly because of how they are sewn on, and with thin thread.",38674,2
38674,I'm attaching photos.,38674,2
38674,"We are returning the jacket because of the buttons, so I would be very grateful if anyone who has this jacket can tell me if that is normal, or if this is a defect.",38674,2
38674,"The fabric is suburb, almost ""too nice"" says my son who works in a busy catering kitchen.",38674,2
38674,"His jackets take a lot of abuse, so he's not sure how this fabric would hold up over time.",38674,2
38674,"It's not stiff like other jackets he's had, and feels soft and more like all cotton.",38674,2
38674,"It's also a superior fit for a thin/average person, because it seems nicely fitted.",38674,2
38674,We had to return several Medium jackets (other brands and styles) because the Medium was more like an XL.,38674,2
38674,"Although it is unisex, it would be perfect for a female.",38674,2
38674,"It looked great and very upscale, and the first thing my son said when he tried it on, was: ""wow, nice.""",38674,2
38674,Then we noticed the buttons flopping around.,38674,2
38674,"The sleeves are very long, but can be rolled.",38674,2
38675,"The material is cheap and it showed, considering it came ripped.",38675,2
38676,Extremely small and smells funky,38676,2
38677,Size is off on this one.,38677,2
38678,They look kinda cheap.,38678,2
38679,I got the wrong one.,38679,2
38679,It should not be the mirrored one.,38679,2
38680,"Stiff, rigid, scratchy, and not small enough.",38680,2
38681,wrong shirt!,38681,2
38681,i received a sleeved  cold shoulder style top!,38681,2
38681,nothing like what is pictured here!,38681,2
38681,very disappointed!,38681,2
38682,Fabric is dignity sizes are all wrong extremely small does not line up with the printed measurements very disappointed,38682,2
38683,They were way small and cheap material.,38683,2
38684,"The product I purchased was for my wife, when they came it looks like men's masculine dark rimmed glasses, and do not look anything like the picture online.",38684,2
38684,"Woman's glasses should look feminine, not like Buddy Holly glasses.",38684,2
38685,"I got a size bigger than I was planning and its a good thing I did.... the side that buttons/opens is great, but the side that does not unbotton and is just a slide on part is very small and does not work.",38685,2
38685,So when my little one had a dirty swim diaper....,38685,2
38685,"I had to wiggle it down, making her leg dirty and since one side could open and one couldn't... it was a lopsided mess once you added the water that was still in it from the pool and her wet legs.",38685,2
38686,They were just okay .,38686,2
38686,They came in a nice case !,38686,2
38686,The gold looked really spray painted on .,38686,2
38686,I suggest a lighter color so it won't contrast so much .,38686,2
38686,I sent it back .,38686,2
38687,"The ""thing"" I got in the mail was a artfully crafted pillowcase, the pic of this product makes you think it's fuzzy worm and sweater like ....Nope , it's poorly sewn, not fluffy, I'd say fuzzy but in a good way I gave it two stars becouse it wasn't a lot of money I geuss, ,and I do were it when I paint so my clothes don't get damaged so I geuss I use it .",38687,2
38688,I ordered a medium and was sent an XL.,38688,2
38688,It barely fit.,38688,2
38688,I am a standard size 6.,38688,2
38688,"The design is nice, but the cut is strange.",38688,2
38688,The bra cups were very tiny for an XL.,38688,2
38688,I took them out and it helped.,38688,2
38688,"However, the sides of the top gathered funny.",38688,2
38688,I would not recommend this item.,38688,2
38689,I had to return this.,38689,2
38689,"I'm 5'9"" and my measurements are 40 32 40 so pretty busty and hippy so I need the extra coverage and support.",38689,2
38689,This made me look frumpy.,38689,2
38689,The bottoms were way to big and the bra cups were to small but the band around my ribs was huge.,38689,2
38689,The material felt cheap.,38689,2
38689,The color was really pretty though.,38689,2
38690,Somewhat small.,38690,2
38690,And there is zero support or shape to it.,38690,2
38691,It wasn't long enough for torso.,38691,2
38692,Not what I was hoping...,38692,2
38692,The material is scratchy and much more see-through than I expected.,38692,2
38692,"I was looking for something that would be kind of see-through in the right light (to wear with a cute new bralette), unfortunately this would be see through in any light at all, so really can't be worn on it's own.",38692,2
38692,It's also significantly shorter than it looks in the picture.,38692,2
38693,These earrings are really cute but they are junk.,38693,2
38693,The post bent severely during first use.,38693,2
38693,Can't use them now.,38693,2
38694,returned for refund.,38694,2
38694,much to small,38694,2
38695,I guess you get what you pay for.,38695,2
38695,The sweater is oversized but very cheap looking and the material is rough and uncomfortable next to my skin.,38695,2
38696,I like the design of the bracelet but it is NOT real silver.,38696,2
38696,It also took forever to get to me and when it did arrive it was kinked.,38696,2
38696,I was able to get most of the kinks out but there is still one big one.,38696,2
38696,"If you were considering buying this item, I would keep shopping!!!",38696,2
38696,!,38696,2
38697,The colors do not match the image shown.,38697,2
38697,It was solid black with no silver on butterfly piece.,38697,2
38697,Beside that good quality and well designed.,38697,2
38698,Fabric quality is very bad and size is too big than other band swimingwear.,38698,2
38698,Not reccomend.,38698,2
38699,it looks fine its just small for me and the fabric is very thin .,38699,2
38700,Cheap material,38700,2
38701,I am a woman with a some what small head I suppose.,38701,2
38701,BecauSs I purchased these for myself and when they arrived I adjusted the strap to the smallest it would go and they were still way to big for me.,38701,2
38701,Fit my boyfriend perfectly though.,38701,2
38701,My loss was his gain.,38701,2
38702,I don't have many nice things to say about this sweater.,38702,2
38702,"It's mostly see through, the material is very thin, the sleeves are way too short, the ""dress"" is much shorter than I expected.",38702,2
38702,"I'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs with pretty short arms so I thought the large would fit fine, I was wrong.",38702,2
38702,I would not reccomend.,38702,2
38703,Light flimsy material.,38703,2
38703,Toddler will out grow in a few months,38703,2
38704,To toght and short.,38704,2
38704,Was really looking forward in wearing his dress.,38704,2
38704,Not happy with it.,38704,2
38705,Way too small.,38705,2
38705,"Asked for a 8.5 mens, got a 7.5.",38705,2
38706,Bad quality the hair is just hot glued on and you can see all the glue on the headband and to top it off I will have to glue it again to make sure it looks right.,38706,2
38707,itchy,38707,2
38708,Made of plastic and was all scratched up.,38708,2
38709,Really cheap quality.,38709,2
38709,"And yes, I understand it didn't cost much.",38709,2
38709,"But it arrived broken, sooo... Also, the chain is much thicker that it looks in the picture so it also looks kind of cheap.",38709,2
38710,It says 12 months size but it was very small as compare to Carters.,38710,2
38710,Did not fit my 10 months kid.,38710,2
38711,"Cute, but the outside pocket ripped and I lost small items down inside below the main lining.",38711,2
38711,I sewed it up and then it happened on the other side of the pocket.,38711,2
38711,Frustrating.,38711,2
38711,Still cute.,38711,2
38711,"This bag is large enough for every day use, even to stash items bought if you forgot your recycle bag.",38711,2
38712,Tight and made my shoulders sore.,38712,2
38712,Cool T shirt but you have to be 180 lbs,38712,2
38713,Made of pot metal.,38713,2
38714,"The tag says 6T but size is more like 4T, already too small for my 5 years old...",38714,2
38715,Came fast but it's cheaply made .,38715,2
38716,Did not fit as advertised,38716,2
38717,"Nice fabric, but it too large.",38717,2
38718,The color was not as vivid and the material was very thin.,38718,2
38718,This is not made to go in the water or to wear on a beach.,38718,2
38718,"However, I do believe that it could be sexy lingerie.",38718,2
38718,"You have to rely on yourself to tie it correctly, but there is no breast support.",38718,2
38719,"It's on the smaller side, but looks cute on.....",38719,2
38719,However.....The material is see-through when wet.,38719,2
38719,I would not recommend this suit because of that.,38719,2
38720,This is my second attempt at writing a review.,38720,2
38720,I ordered a size XL...and got something that would fit my size 7 daughter.,38720,2
38720,The quality is good.,38720,2
38720,"But the sizing is very off, I assume, because I could not find a tag anywhere in the shorts to say for sure what size they really are.",38720,2
38721,"Good quality just 2 small, did not fit as expected... Not even close",38721,2
38722,Disappointed with how you have to manipulate it to go on.,38722,2
38722,Just not something I would normally order so it will probably never be used by me.,38722,2
38723,This was way too small.,38723,2
38723,My boyfriend is a large in every other brand of underwear but this brand didn't fit at all.,38723,2
38724,"Size wise it fit, but I hated the material.",38724,2
38724,"It feels scratchy, and it's some type of a rayon material.",38724,2
38724,I should have paid more attention to what the material was.,38724,2
38724,"It looked like cotton in the picture, and I guess I was just excited by how the picture looked.",38724,2
38724,I guess I can wear a tank top underneath.,38724,2
38724,It's very staticky too.,38724,2
38725,Stretches after wearing it a short period of time,38725,2
38726,Meh...buy yourself something with higher quality,38726,2
38727,Fits somewhat small,38727,2
38728,This fits as expected.,38728,2
38728,But it is not flattering at all.,38728,2
38728,Looks like a sack.,38728,2
38728,Doesn't hang like the picture at all.,38728,2
38728,If I had seen this in person at a store I wouldn't have purchased it.,38728,2
38728,Probably will send it back if I can't pawn it off on my mom.,38728,2
38729,Too small,38729,2
38730,This is about 2 sizes too small.,38730,2
38730,My Super Saiyan arms barely fit in the sleeves and I could never zip it up.,38730,2
38731,Too much of a good thing!,38731,2
38732,Didn't get at all the designs advertised in the picture - which was pretty important.,38732,2
38732,Returned it .,38732,2
38733,I bought the same size from iplay (different listings) and this pair is too small.,38733,2
38733,My daughter is in 12 month clothing so I bought 12 to 18 months swim diaper.,38733,2
38733,It fits more like a 9 month!,38733,2
38734,Not a very good looking bracelet.,38734,2
38734,It is bad quality wood.,38734,2
38735,said 34waist but more like 33 for sure,38735,2
38736,Product arrived and had holes all over the shirt.,38736,2
38736,"Very noticeable when you are wearing it even though it is ""camo"" Not little holes but circles that look like the size of a crayola marker cap.",38736,2
38737,Poor quality from China as usual.,38737,2
38738,The shirt was way too small so if you want a medium order a large and this shirt is really itchy when u put it on,38738,2
38739,the top is way cute.,38739,2
38739,bottoms fit like a diaper.,38739,2
38739,mix and match,38739,2
38740,Cute and very everything fit well and then yeah first time I was it the whole zipper and everything on the dress was completely jacked.,38740,2
38740,It's too bad because I loved the dress it fit well and was cute.,38740,2
38740,Just bad quality.,38740,2
38740,I kept it still to see if I could find someone to fix the zipper,38740,2
38741,You can't see that well and the eyes are hard to see blink.,38741,2
38741,Good quality but I wouldn't buy again,38741,2
38742,My shirt had holes in the side seams of the shirt.,38742,2
38742,Not the quality I had expected.,38742,2
38743,Much shorter than I expected,38743,2
38744,"Because the fabric is stretchy, it is wearable, but not flattering.",38744,2
38744,Advertised as a cotton T I was expecting a different feel to the fabric.,38744,2
38744,"There is not a label anywhere to let me know if it is indeed cotton or a blend, and if a blend, what that blend is.",38744,2
38745,Much too difficult to close.,38745,2
38746,These were terrible.,38746,2
38746,The baby was wearing these and sitting on the bed while we got ready.,38746,2
38746,It was like she was completely naked.,38746,2
38746,There was urine everywhere on the bed.,38746,2
38746,The diapers did nothing to hold it back.,38746,2
38746,I was not a happy camper.,38746,2
38747,Too tight around the waist; I'l be returning it.,38747,2
38748,I gave it a 2 cause it looks just like the picture super cute and simple but I really hate the fact that the top is smaller than the swimsuit I currently have which is an XL top the bottoms I have is a large but these bottoms fit like an xl and the top like a medium when I ordered a 3xl i was gonna give my mom's the bottom cause I only bought this suit for the top cause it's cute and would be big enough for my chest but it barely covered anything so sizing is way off on this swimsuit,38748,2
38749,too small,38749,2
38750,Dress would have received 5 stars if it had fit.,38750,2
38750,"For the price, this dress is fantastic.",38750,2
38750,I wear a size 10/12 and bough a large.,38750,2
38750,I looked like a misshapen sausage.,38750,2
38750,Go up a size.,38750,2
38751,The item is broken and missing a chain and connection point.,38751,2
38751,Hoping for an exchange that is not broken.,38751,2
38751,Feel cheated.,38751,2
38752,Be aware that the return window is VERY short.,38752,2
38752,30 days after purchase.,38752,2
38752,I am now stuck with 5 pair of pants that are too big.,38752,2
38753,Fit in waist but super short,38753,2
38754,It was too tight he could not get it over his head the pants made him feel uncomfortable everything is his size but they just don't fit,38754,2
38755,The sizing charts were off and it was much smaller than expected.,38755,2
38756,extremely disappointing..clown costume,38756,2
38757,have SAME SIZE from another source that is somewhat large,38757,2
38758,Wrong set,38758,2
38759,WAY TOO BIG,38759,2
38760,"Wears poorly, without structure.",38760,2
38760,Not a swimsuit.,38760,2
38760,It is a pretty color.,38760,2
38761,"The bottom of this is actually adorable, but WOW you can't wear this if you have any boobs.",38761,2
38761,AT ALL.,38761,2
38761,I'm not really 100% sure how you're supposed to wear this without showing everyone everything.,38761,2
38761,Might make a cute skirt.,38761,2
38762,Loved the glasses but there was a huge scratch on the lens and a scratch on the frames as well.,38762,2
38763,The material on this dress is very thin.,38763,2
38763,I will be returning it if I cannot find a slip that I can wear with it.,38763,2
38763,"This, of course, will add to the cost of the dress.",38763,2
38763,Otherwise it is very beautiful and fits well.,38763,2
38764,Was disappointing and didn't stick.,38764,2
38764,I would not recommend this product.,38764,2
38764,I wear a 32C and it fit like a small B.,38764,2
38765,too big,38765,2
38766,I was really surprised that it did not come with the mounting bars needed to attach the band to the actual watch.,38766,2
38766,"Unfortunately for me, I did not have any extra ones lying around from another band (not surprising for someone that is buying a watch band), making the band completely unusable.",38766,2
38766,"I did give the product an extra star, however, because the band seems to be good quality and suspect I will like it after I separately purchase the metal bars needed to attach the band.",38766,2
38767,"Thin material, it looks cheap.",38767,2
38767,You will definitely need a slip under it.,38767,2
38768,I requested 3X and it was not near the 3X,38768,2
38769,just too small,38769,2
38770,Sleeves are really short and not what it looks like in the picture.,38770,2
38770,I didn't like the material either.,38770,2
38770,It looks like a spandex material.,38770,2
38771,Can't close it,38771,2
38772,It's ok  but the ring change colors,38772,2
38773,"Size not so accurate, according 2 the size chart",38773,2
38774,I sent it back.,38774,2
38774,It was just too small.,38774,2
38775,Not my style and I was trying something new.,38775,2
38775,OK for price.,38775,2
38775,Just a bit snug.,38775,2
38776,I got the purse for my wife as a Mother's Day gift.,38776,2
38776,The zipper don't work.,38776,2
38776,One month later the shoulder strap broke.,38776,2
38777,"The make of this bra is so confusing, as the front is ok, but the straps and placements are really not comfortable.",38777,2
38777,The straps slide down too quickly and its not ideal at all.,38777,2
38778,too small,38778,2
38779,soso,38779,2
38780,really was not too happy with dress.. it was to tight in places and baggy in others,38780,2
38781,Really small but decent quality!,38781,2
38781,I don't think they'll stay in my nose Long as it is so small I can't add anything to secure it,38781,2
38782,"Looks nothing like picture, is bright orange in real life.",38782,2
38783,"Noticeably poor quality, is very very small, fits on my pinkie but even with having to stretch it out.",38783,2
38783,Can't see how I would get it to comfortably fit on my other fingers.,38783,2
38783,"However, works great as a toe ring!",38783,2
38784,Way bigger than expected.,38784,2
38784,"One side is puckered at lace top other side is not,  big and boxy, not as contoured and swing look as pictured,I like the color but would not purchase again.",38784,2
38784,"Will probably give away, not sure I will ever wear it.",38784,2
38785,"Like the style, size and color BUT very cheaply made and plastic zipper is hard to open and close.",38785,2
38786,"I'm 5'3"", about 160 pounds, so the M/L should fit me well enough with plenty of room, right?",38786,2
38786,Nope.,38786,2
38786,"Usually when I order sizes for taller people, I can pull the tights up to my ribcage, just under my bra strap, but not with these; I got them up to my belly button, and even then the crotch was a 3-5 inches below where it should have been.",38786,2
38786,"All that, and these didn't seem that fleece-y.",38786,2
38786,I've had better before.,38786,2
38787,Received earlier than expected and i love them!,38787,2
38787,They fit perfect.,38787,2
38787,Just enough room to wear over my jeans.,38787,2
38787,"I usually wear a 71/2-8 US and i bought a 6 UK.Thanks:)
update: They only lasted one season.",38787,2
38787,Cracked on sides of feet.,38787,2
38787,Not worth the money.,38787,2
38787,They were cute though.,38787,2
38787,Disappointed.,38787,2
38788,I am a size 8/10 with a smallish waist.,38788,2
38788,I usually go down a size in a skirt.,38788,2
38788,I couldn't dream of getting this around my mid section.,38788,2
38788,I should've gotten the plus.,38788,2
38788,"However, the fabric feels really cheap and hot so I won't bother but the bird print is beautiful.",38788,2
38789,would no recommend to any one larger than size 6,38789,2
38790,The fabric hugs the wrong areas of my body and makes me look really wide.,38790,2
38790,"Although I am pregnant, I am a very thin pregnant woman and am still wearing non-maternity dresses that I get complimented on all the time.",38790,2
38790,"While, I'm flattered about that, this dress made me appear to have a torpedo shaped belly, and a wide butt.",38790,2
38790,And the fabric made me look jiggly.,38790,2
38790,Just not what I expected after some of the reviews.,38790,2
38790,"I have decided to make it an ""around the house"" dress.",38790,2
38790,And to some degree I don't even want to wear it in front of my husband for too long.,38790,2
38790,More disappointed than I expected.,38790,2
38791,Cute and well made but received wrong size which maybe could fit a 10 yr old,38791,2
38792,"I gave this 2 stars because while the romper is actually really cute, the front is cut entirely toooooo low.",38792,2
38792,Like down to your stomach low.,38792,2
38792,You'd have to wear a bralette or safety pin it to not have your entire boob showing.,38792,2
38793,"They don't stretch at all, and im only 5'3 weighing 115 lbs, come right above my ankle and they are pretty damn small.",38793,2
38793,got a small tear in the thigh in them when gently trying to get them on.,38793,2
38793,"I don't expect them to last very long :/
super cute.",38793,2
38793,but not worth the $12.,38793,2
38794,Wrinkled after first use and ran extremely small.,38794,2
38794,I was going to get a large and ended up getting a extra large and boy am I glad to.,38794,2
38794,The extra large was FAR too small.,38794,2
38794,I cant even believe I considered the large!!,38794,2
38794,"I mean I'm big but I am definitely not a two xl, and even before my first use it was wrinkled!",38794,2
38794,I'm afraid to use this with a Iron because the material is ridiculously thin!,38794,2
38794,Save your money and spend the extra 70 for a quality jacket.,38794,2
38795,ok,38795,2
38796,I am changing my review because after the wash I am not happy with my purchase,38796,2
38797,:(,38797,2
38798,Shorter then I expected,38798,2
38799,"Flimsy, flex with gentle use, tint is pretty light so not very helpful for bright sun.",38799,2
38800,"Cheaply made, thin metal.",38800,2
38800,The lenses themselves are good but the frames are terrible.,38800,2
38801,"This is a beautiful coat, it's soft, the color is perfect, I love the bold buttons and it is too small!!",38801,2
38801,"I was so excited about this coat, being one of my first purchases on Amazon I didn't realize that  the coat was not a US size.",38801,2
38801,Much too small.,38801,2
38802,"It's cute, but it's too small for me",38802,2
38803,Ear Mitts to small.,38803,2
38803,Had send them back.,38803,2
38804,The top was way too large and the bottom was way too small.,38804,2
38805,This necklace is very large and cheesy.,38805,2
38805,"Comes on a long, cheap chain.",38805,2
38805,May be good as costume jewelry or on Halloween but definitely not for everyday use.,38805,2
38806,Still cute but waaaay too big.,38806,2
38806,I should have known that a 9-18 month outfit would be that way.,38806,2
38806,"It's a very cheap ""made in China"" quality of materials, especially the ""shoes"".",38806,2
38806,Not worth the money.,38806,2
38806,Returning this item.,38806,2
38806,I'd recommend not wasting the money on this one.,38806,2
38807,"Waaaayyyyy too small, I get them to my 10 year old son.",38807,2
38807,They fit him perfectly.,38807,2
38808,It was so big and did not have the big neck for over the shoulder wear so it just looks like a big shirt.,38808,2
38808,Also it was torn on the bottom.,38808,2
38809,Color is too bright.,38809,2
38809,Large on the top but small (tight) on the waist,38809,2
38810,Too small but It was cheap so I guess it's expected.,38810,2
38811,"Keep Hands warm, but the index finger and thumb on the right side does not work with the iPhone 6+ that I have.",38811,2
38811,"I am right handed, so this really doesn't do anything than a NORMAL GLOVE would do.",38811,2
38811,"Can't return because it is past the time, but didn't need to use until January 2, 2015 due to a ""warm winter"".",38811,2
38811,"BUMMER - don't take a chance, if you buy, Try them immediately.",38811,2
38812,Not exactly what I expected from the look of the pictures.,38812,2
38812,The material is itchy & not soft.,38812,2
38813,To call this a XXL is a bit absurd.,38813,2
38813,It's pretty tiny.,38813,2
38813,Otherwise good material and well made.,38813,2
38814,Size runs small,38814,2
38815,This product came much earlier than expected which is great and it is really pretty but is WAY smaller than the size I ordered.,38815,2
38815,Will be returning it.,38815,2
38816,They came in way too small,38816,2
38817,Did not like this product at all.,38817,2
38817,Does not fit well and I do not like the material.,38817,2
38818,"See, the material is nice and soft but i couldn't really tell that it was a shell, also it fit me like pasties!",38818,2
38818,It was WAYYYY too small :/,38818,2
38819,it rolls up and doesn't really fit well it seems like  just a stretchy piece of material lack sewn together,38819,2
38820,Graphics are poorly done and the shirt material is a little on the thin side.,38820,2
38821,"The fabric itself is thin, thin enough to be transparent when held up to the light and certainly transparent once stretched over the body.",38821,2
38821,"When I held up the dress out of the original packaging, I could tell by the cut that it was not going to be as long as on the model.",38821,2
38821,"The tag (which I would think would have been in the back or on the side seam) was right at the neck (assuming you wear the dress as depicted, as a scoop back dress).",38821,2
38821,"As a curvy girl, the fabric was unflattering, though I think it may have been alright with a fair bit of shapewear.",38821,2
38821,"The cut itself was nice enough, shaped appropriately for an hourglass figure.",38821,2
38821,It seemed as though it would likely be light enough to leave me unencumbered on a warm day.,38821,2
38821,"Overall, I'm disappointed, but I think it could have been O.K.",38821,2
38821,"for somebody, just not me.",38821,2
38822,This is supposed to fit up to 10 lbs.,38822,2
38822,My little one was 8lbs at birth.,38822,2
38822,It was huge!,38822,2
38822,Didn't fit her until this week and she is nearly 4 months old.,38822,2
38822,"Also the ""fabric pen"" is a joke.",38822,2
38822,It was a regular pen.,38822,2
38823,Does not do as advertised.,38823,2
38823,Pretty much just expensive Lycra shirt.,38823,2
38823,Would not reccomend,38823,2
38824,Disappointed with this.,38824,2
38824,Felt like a nightgown rather than a dress.,38824,2
38824,The color I wanted wasn't in stock so I ordered the green which was just OK. Will be returning it.,38824,2
38825,"The fabric was different than I expected and it felt like a nightgown made from polyester, the kind that doesn't ""breathe"" at all; so it's actually too warm for wearing on a hot day.",38825,2
38825,The print was fine but nothing that special.,38825,2
38825,"The real trouble was the length.... Granted I am 5'9 but it's an awkward, not short enough - not long enough, length that isn't doing anyone any favors.",38825,2
38825,It is comfortable though...,38825,2
38825,If it was a bargain price I might hem or something but the price is average for what you get.,38825,2
38825,I'm returning it.,38825,2
38826,"Wish it fit better, a snug curving shirt.",38826,2
38826,The material blend I don't care for.,38826,2
38827,The pendant itself is beautiful.,38827,2
38827,Unfortunately I was able to get hardly any of my dads ashes in it which upsetting.,38827,2
38827,"When I say hardly any, I mean there isn't even a measurement little enough I could use to describe how much so I had gotten ashes everywhere which only made it more upsetting.",38827,2
38827,"I definitely wouldn't have gotten it, especially for the price I paid in shipping alone, had I known.",38827,2
38828,"Disappointed that the size XL must mean a large child even though the product is called ""Lady Faux Fur.",38828,2
38828,.,38828,2
38828,".""",38828,2
38829,"So when you first click into the item, before selecting anything the description says 100% cotton.",38829,2
38829,As soon as you make a choice it changes.,38829,2
38829,I didn't notice this when I bought it.,38829,2
38829,"I read the description, made my selection then clicked check out.",38829,2
38829,Who re-reads the description after selecting a size and color?!?,38829,2
38829,You expect it to be the same as what you read before the selection!,38829,2
38829,"I purchased this for the rennasaince faire but the dress I recieved, I'd never be able to last the day in it because it doesn't breath at all!",38829,2
38829,I gave it 2 stars because it's a nice style dress but I'm extremely upset with the bait and switch as far as the material!,38829,2
38830,Quality is good but size is not.,38830,2
38830,Either I made a mistake in ordering or this 36 is about 2 1/2 inches shorter than other belts I have of the same nominal size.,38830,2
38830,I can barely get to the first hole.,38830,2
38830,Maybe they shipped the wrong size.,38830,2
38831,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,38831,2
38831,"Too big , different fit !",38831,2
38832,They did not fit as expected.,38832,2
38832,Go at least a size larger maybe even two sizes larger when ordering.,38832,2
38833,Was not cute for bachelorette party - seemed more for an outdoor older woman.,38833,2
38833,returned it.,38833,2
38834,The material feels cheap and the sweatshirt was at least 2 sizes too small and I ordered it a size larger than I wear.,38834,2
38834,I wear M/L and ordered the XL.,38834,2
38834,I held it up to me after trying to squeeze into it and discovered that the shoulder width alone was two inches too narrow.,38834,2
38835,did not fit right,38835,2
38836,"This was not only too large, it didn't look ANYTHING  like the picture.",38836,2
38836,I was very disappointed in the products' look and lack of quality.,38836,2
38837,To slinky,38837,2
38838,"Even following the care instructions, these are of poor quality.",38838,2
38838,The lace was destroyed after the first wash.,38838,2
38838,"The item fits great and isn't too constraining, but disappointing purchase.",38838,2
38839,I like the shirt but I should have ordered XL,38839,2
38840,"The photo on Amazon was very pretty and the term ""Ocean Mosaic"" seemed representative, as it showed several different colors and sizes of blues and greens, which is what one might expect of a ""mosaic"" approach.",38840,2
38840,The charm itself does not look like that.,38840,2
38840,"It is mainly silver pave, with small, dark green stones interspersed.",38840,2
38840,"If I put it under a close, bright light, it looks a bit more aqua-colored, but when worn, it looks like a silver pave, with some small, dark green accents.",38840,2
38840,"As I rule, I'm not a pave fan, but the image on Amazon looked so attractive and stone-laden that I thought I would love it.",38840,2
38840,I did not.,38840,2
38841,Bought for an 85 llb 11 year old.... it was WAY too small for her.,38841,2
38841,Hmmmmm,38841,2
38842,Returned this dress.,38842,2
38842,Large on top and small in waist and hips.,38842,2
38842,I like the style and color of the dress but it was also very thin material and would not be suitable for cold climate.,38842,2
38843,Very pretty but difficult to put on.,38843,2
38843,As well as too small.,38843,2
38843,Ordered a large and it's like a medium,38843,2
38844,Two stars because it's cute.,38844,2
38844,Material is really thin and more shirt like than sweater.,38844,2
38844,Pretty disappointed.,38844,2
38844,I usually wear a medium shirt and I ordered an XL based on the other review and yea maybe its a kids XL (which would still be bigger).,38844,2
38844,"It's really small, it fits more like a tight shirt than a baggy sweater shirt thing.",38844,2
38844,I don't know what the return policy is but I'll be looking into it.,38844,2
38845,Bought this as a gift and 2 of the glass beads broke after one day of wearing it.,38845,2
38845,I guess you get what you pay for.,38845,2
38845,Its too bad because it is really pretty.,38845,2
38846,Cute dress however when it came the lace looked as if it had holes in it in several places.,38846,2
38846,Additionally the lace was made off center of the dress and didn't drop down to the split as shown in the picture.,38846,2
38846,This made for a pocket bulge in the front of the dress.,38846,2
38846,It could be a great dress if it were made were made properly but at this price I guess you get what you pay for.,38846,2
38847,"I really didn't like shirt at all, it looked really cheap with the synthetic mini turtle neck at the top.",38847,2
38847,"Also, the length of the shirt is between a normal length and a crop top.",38847,2
38848,"If you are a woman with large breasts, this dress will not fit.",38848,2
38848,I bought it for a plus-size family member.,38848,2
38848,We had to send it back even though the size was what she measures.,38848,2
38848,It was cut way too small across the bodice.,38848,2
38849,After two washes and two wears the elasticity on the top half of the dress was ruined.,38849,2
38849,It was a beautiful dress to wear but I wish the quality of the elastic was better.,38849,2
38849,"If you just want this dress for one wear, absolutely get it but I am not happy that i already have to throw it away.",38849,2
38849,"To me, wasn't worth it.",38849,2
38850,cute idea but doesn't look like the picture!,38850,2
38850,ears are not defined so they look like fangs.,38850,2
38850,the paws are also not well defined and  look like scratch marks.,38850,2
38850,i ordered this intending to give as a gift to a cat lover but it misses the mark.,38850,2
38850,bummed :(,38850,2
38851,looks cheap,38851,2
38852,The bottom part is large/wide.,38852,2
38853,Didn't like the fact it turned my figment green and,38853,2
38854,This choker was huge.,38854,2
38854,Definitely for someone with a longer neck.,38854,2
38855,Very cheap - what a disappointment!,38855,2
38856,I had rotator cuff surgery and can't wear regular bras yet.,38856,2
38856,these let too much of me hang out.,38856,2
38856,"I ordered xl, the biggest offered at this site, but the regular sports bras just squish me into one big breast.",38856,2
38856,ugh I hate this.,38856,2
38857,Shorter than I expected,38857,2
38858,I was very disappointed as it is too small.,38858,2
38858,"It is such a cute top but it isn't just a little too small, it is way to small.",38858,2
38859,The shoulders are wider than you'd expect for an xxs.,38859,2
38859,Unless you tie the ribbon in front.,38859,2
38859,I had to make it as tight as possible not to hang out of it.,38859,2
38860,Super cute and my daughter loved it until the clasp broke the 2nd day she had it.,38860,2
38860,:-(,38860,2
38861,I hated the firm I gave these pants away.,38861,2
38861,"The bottom is super skinny and tight, but at the top, they're loose and saggy.",38861,2
38861,Low quality as well,38861,2
38862,The sizes are miss leading....go a size up.,38862,2
38863,I was hoping for something sexy and form-fitting.,38863,2
38863,"The buttons come down to my navel, as well.",38863,2
38864,"Cute shirt, just too small.",38864,2
38865,It was soooo cute and I can't even fit one leg into it.,38865,2
38865,"I got a large when I usually wear a medium,  I'm just glad I didn't pay a lot for it.",38865,2
38866,Thankfully I only paid like $12.00 for it.,38866,2
38866,"I was so excited to receive it in the mail, and as soon as i tried it on...my mind was completely changed.",38866,2
38866,Super thin and you can see right through it.,38866,2
38866,The top is super small.,38866,2
38866,I even ordered two sizes bigger just to make sure it fits my chest.,38866,2
38866,Bottoms fit great.,38866,2
38866,Kind of bummed.,38866,2
38866,Oh well... decided to buy a fitted one from Victorias Secret.,38866,2
38866,I guess thats what i get for buying a bathing suit on amazon...,38866,2
38867,So cute but runs SO SMALL!,38867,2
38867,It's no where close to the size they are claiming it is.,38867,2
38867,It's like three sizes smaller than US sizing.,38867,2
38868,It doesn't fit like I had hoped.,38868,2
38869,Cheap,38869,2
38870,I bought these for my second half marathon because I got terrible blisters for my first one.,38870,2
38870,Still got blisters for my second with these.,38870,2
38870,But I like how they fit and they're good for everything else besides long distances.,38870,2
38871,Not impressed with size - seems like a poor quality shirt.,38871,2
38871,Nothing like the Famous shirts bought from Tilly's.,38871,2
38871,Not to mention there were no tags on this shirt???,38871,2
38871,?,38871,2
38872,They look nice but they are too large and heavy.,38872,2
38872,The nose pads are set so that the glasses protrude forward from your face about a full 1/2 inch.,38872,2
38872,What good are sunglasses that allow the sun to shine in from the top and the sides?,38872,2
38873,Too small,38873,2
38874,Well made cap but was too small for me.,38874,2
38875,It's well made.,38875,2
38875,I expected it to cover my lower neck better.,38875,2
38875,To fit under the color of a shirt.,38875,2
38875,It's not long enough,38875,2
38876,The dress was cute but the size was not even close to standard sizing.,38876,2
38876,I ordered a 3x which is what I wear in all other brands.,38876,2
38876,The sizing was a big disappointment that came at a time when I didn't have time to exchange it before the event I unwanted it for,38876,2
38877,Did not fit me properly .,38877,2
38877,I think it was little small for me .,38877,2
38877,Even with a little bit of walking it slides down my pregnant tummy .. Not comfortable,38877,2
38878,"If I got the proper size, I would be happy",38878,2
38879,These are too big to be used for a tregus piercing.,38879,2
38879,Which is what I got them for so I can't use them.,38879,2
38879,"I would like to point out the reason I purchased these is because they came up on my search when I typed in ""tregus jewelry"" so it has nothing to do with the jewelry itself, but they shouldn't be catagorized for that specific piercing.",38879,2
38880,The leather itself smells wonderful!,38880,2
38880,"However, it's gigantic and has too much room.",38880,2
38880,Very thick and bulky.,38880,2
38880,Not at all what I'd expected.,38880,2
38880,Bought it as a gift and the gentleman is making it work for him by cutting out the inside pockets.,38880,2
38880,It should of came with a strap.,38880,2
38881,Bigger than pictured,38881,2
38882,Sizes run small,38882,2
38883,"I loved this shirt, except for the fact that the ""E"" in Ravenclaw came off the shirt.",38883,2
38883,"I have been debating wether or not I will order a new one, seeing if I simply got a defective one.",38883,2
38884,My breasts were not held in well by this design which resulted in me not using it.,38884,2
38884,Made me sad because I love the style,38884,2
38885,This was definitely made for smaller bodies than mine.,38885,2
38885,I have a 36DD chest and this barely fit up top.,38885,2
38885,The top part is also so short that I looked like a little girl wearing it.,38885,2
38885,"The ""belt"" area came right up to my boobs and made it look like a little girls dress.",38885,2
38885,I imagine it would look better on smaller breasted women.,38885,2
38885,"I can forgive sizing if quality is good, but for me, it just wasn't.",38885,2
38885,some of the threads were loose right out of the bag and it just didn't feel like a quality pie of clothing.,38885,2
38886,"Firsy upper body well but extremely tight around the butt, not alot of stretch, material is also itchy",38886,2
38887,When I buy clothes I pay close attention to fabric.,38887,2
38887,This one is REALLY bad fabric.,38887,2
38887,Don't buy it.,38887,2
38887,I've had it for more than a year and haven't been able to wear it.,38887,2
38887,"Too small, too cheap.",38887,2
38888,"These make me look like I""m on my way to a ballet class.",38888,2
38888,I would definitely not wear them in public due to how funny this color looks.,38888,2
38889,doesn't fit a teenager let alone an adult,38889,2
38890,Looks nice but the hat itself is of poor quality,38890,2
38891,"This is very light, and small, don't expect it to stay without rolling up under the breast.",38891,2
38892,This did not last long - I wore it twice in hawaii for lounging and the buttons on the side cam off so I wound up sending it back.,38892,2
38893,:(,38893,2
38894,This is not oversized.,38894,2
38894,its tight and short.,38894,2
38894,I wouldn't be able to wear much under it.,38894,2
38894,Not what it appears in the photo at all.,38894,2
38894,That girl must be wearing an XL.,38894,2
38894,I tried a medium and I'm normally a small and it did not fit at all.,38894,2
38894,Also the Flamingo is veryyyy orange.,38894,2
38894,I thought it was shades of pink in the photo but theres a lott of orange through out and it looks tacky.,38894,2
38895,"Good price, but you get what you pay for -- after only a couple months of occasional / moderate use, the backing is starting to pull away from the belt.",38895,2
38896,Did not like the stitching.,38896,2
38896,I intended this for a gift but it looks too cheap.,38896,2
38897,The bottoms fit nicely however the top is way too small..I was spilling out of it.,38897,2
38897,I usually wear a size L but I got an XXL in this suit.,38897,2
38898,The shirt quality was horrible.,38898,2
38898,I wore it once or twice and then donated it.,38898,2
38899,The shirt was way to small for a 4T in comparison to weight and height.,38899,2
38899,Order a size up.,38899,2
38900,The product came with a hole in the robe and the robe itself is pretty short.,38900,2
38900,The teddy was itchy and had a hole in it too.,38900,2
38900,Don't waste your time.,38900,2
38900,On the good hand the color was nice.,38900,2
38901,So much bigger than expected.,38901,2
38901,I looked as if I had been swallowed up in this shirt.,38901,2
38901,"I loved the fabric, however.",38901,2
38902,"I was supposed to get the headband and tail, but the package came torn and there was only the headband on a ripped piece of cardboard.",38902,2
38902,Will be requesting a return.,38902,2
38903,Poor quality zipper.,38903,2
38903,It broke after one week of use.,38903,2
38904,"These were too small for my mother, they were too tight.",38904,2
38904,Might have too go a side up from your usual size.,38904,2
38905,"Very flimsy, Metal/plastic is too soft.",38905,2
38905,"You have to bend it to fit on the ear, bending only to snuggly fit and earring falls off, bent it a little more and earring bent in half.",38905,2
38905,I would not recommend this product.,38905,2
38905,It was pretty while it was on,38905,2
38906,"My daughter normally wears an 8, and that's what we ordered, a size 8.",38906,2
38906,The dress is so large it would have to be take in at least 2 inches to fit her.,38906,2
38906,"Sadly, we won't have a new dress in time to utilize it for the intended purpose.",38906,2
38907,I don't like the color.,38907,2
38907,It doesn't look like real gold.,38907,2
38908,Heavy on the bridge of my nose!,38908,2
38908,Leaves huge marks!,38908,2
38909,"I didn't read where it was from so it fit too small, gonna read descriptions next time.",38909,2
38910,It was way too long for me but an attractive top.,38910,2
38911,"As other reviewers have said, this shirt fit fine out of the package, but with one washing (yes, I read the label directions), the shirt sleeve shrank significantly in length (more than 1"", leaving no cuff exposure possible on me with a jacket), and the collar shrunk enough to be uncomfortable to button.",38911,2
38911,"Still fine for a use as a casual shirt with some jeans, it seems well made and with a comfortable fabric, but the shrinkage makes this an unacceptable product for a dress wardrobe.",38911,2
38911,"That's really a shame, because the shirt feels great otherwise.",38911,2
38912,Too small,38912,2
38913,The back of the slippers are not sturdy enough.,38913,2
38913,They fall inward and then it is like wearing a backless shoe.,38913,2
38914,"This was the exact style that i was looking for, but it is a little too small and it already coming undone on the stitching.",38914,2
38914,I have an 11 month old who weighs 18 lbs and is very petite and this is too small.,38914,2
38914,"It is fine on the length, but the width is too narrow.",38914,2
38914,It was a struggle to put it over her shoulders.,38914,2
38914,The seam is coming undone already so now i'm gonna have to fix the stitching.,38914,2
38915,The note stated that the dress ran big.,38915,2
38915,I ordered my daughters exact size and it was too exact in the neckline and way too short.,38915,2
38915,Did not have enough time to send back because it was for homecoming.,38915,2
38915,"Also, the dress shown prior to ordering was an eggplant purple color.",38915,2
38915,"When received, it was more of a plum color.",38915,2
38916,It had a stain on it when I received it :(,38916,2
38917,Didn't get the right product,38917,2
38918,Wristlet broke off.,38918,2
38918,Normal wear was not hard on it at all.,38918,2
38919,Size XL.,38919,2
38919,The shirt has a somewhat weird fit.,38919,2
38919,"It's a thinner material, so it hugs your body, which isn't good for someone with man boobs.",38919,2
38919,It also flairs out on the bottom some.,38919,2
38919,The logo is lower and smaller than pictured.,38919,2
38919,The material feels nice enough.,38919,2
38919,"If you have more of an athletic build, it'd probably fit fine.",38919,2
38920,Pretty but Broke the same day I wore it.,38920,2
38920,Battery died within two hours.,38920,2
38920,Rhinestones were falling off.,38920,2
38920,Not worth it.,38920,2
38921,Seemed like a good buy but looking closer at these glasses out in daylight they are more of a purple.,38921,2
38921,My son is embarrassed to wear these to school.,38921,2
38921,I didn't notice the purple till after get got rx lenses in and my son wore them out in the daylight.,38921,2
38921,Our family loves raybands but these were really horrible :(,38921,2
38922,Fits very very small.,38922,2
38922,"Got a large, and I am a firm large, not a have to squeeze into large.",38922,2
38922,"It was very small (stretchy so I could get it on) a friend who is a small-medium could barely fit in it, it was too tight on her!",38922,2
38923,this dress is for someone weighing 200 lbs.,38923,2
38923,I gave my measurements don't understand why the dress is so big.,38923,2
38924,This sweater hangs in all the wrong places.,38924,2
38924,No shape/form.,38924,2
38924,It is true to size but doesn't fit my body well,38924,2
38925,I've ordered two skirts previously and this one (olive) is not like the others.,38925,2
38925,The color is correct but it is not A-line!,38925,2
38925,It just hangs on me.,38925,2
38925,The design has a different maker than the other two and feels completely different.,38925,2
38925,Beware of the olive!,38925,2
38926,I usually wear a medium I ordered an extra large and is still way too small.,38926,2
38927,not the quality I thought I was purchasing.,38927,2
38927,It showed up after I needed it and I could not cancel the order.,38927,2
38927,I would like to return it.,38927,2
38928,Too thin.,38928,2
38928,Hardly noticeable and looks like it will break easily.,38928,2
38929,"Great looking on the Web,  size is extremely small,  i ordered the 2x, which was supposed to be equivalent to US large, and it fits like a slim fit med, or regular small.",38929,2
38929,"The fabric is much thinner than it appears, though still an attractive piece.",38929,2
38930,"Very soft material,  kind of chiffon (shiny) and not cotton.",38930,2
38930,The garment seems to be well-made but unfortunately is Asian sized Very small and short wasted.,38930,2
38930,I ordered a 2XL because I have large breasts (2 sizes bigger) and by the time I got it on the dress appeared to be empire wasted (not intentionally).,38930,2
38930,I was unable to breathe and therefore this one is going back.,38930,2
38930,"If you were petite I would say this is probably OK, it appears to be handmade and the craftsmanship looks pretty good.",38930,2
38931,Too small,38931,2
38932,This is super cute and it doesn't look or feel cheap at all.,38932,2
38932,I put it on right when I got it and within a couple hours I realized it wasn't on my ankle and had broken off.,38932,2
38932,"Thankfully I found it and I can fix it, but I would hate for it to break somewhere I couldn't find it",38932,2
38933,"These are not bad, but definitely not the quality I was hoping for.",38933,2
38933,"They are VERY thin, not soft, and wrinkles very easily.",38933,2
38934,"Poor quality, super thin material, had a run in it when I opened it.",38934,2
38935,"does not fit correctly to the frame, due to the incorrect size, its obviously not easy to install.",38935,2
38935,as the original glass.,38935,2
38935,The polarization is very minimal where it dos not really effect and glares.,38935,2
38935,Whether you are driving a boat in the ocean or a car on the road of  Florida weather you really need Polarisation from the glare of the sun.,38935,2
38935,When driving on the road it can rain and then be sunny causing a l ot of bright glares.,38935,2
38935,I have tried calling the company to see if i could get the correct cut  or get one thats actually polarised.,38935,2
38935,"so far I have not heard back from them

I gave two stars for the fact that the lens itself is very nice, its a lot more clear than the original ones my arnette came with.",38935,2
38935,its also a bit lighter.,38935,2
38935,"You cant feel as much, but it does the job.",38935,2
38935,also the product did arrive early then expected for those reasons I gave it a 2.,38935,2
38935,If the company calls me back and gives me the correct lenses I would def bump the stars to 5..,38935,2
38936,Ridiculously small and thw material is just awful!!,38936,2
38936,I'm very petite this was ridiculously small and uncomfortable,38936,2
38937,"The material is nice, soft and comfortable.",38937,2
38937,"However, I like a robe that is loose and hangs freely so I ordered a 3X size.",38937,2
38937,"The robe that arrived is definitely not a 3X size, it's tight and clingy.",38937,2
38937,I feel like I'm wearing a tube.,38937,2
38937,"If you order this, make sure to order a size that is much, much bigger than you think you'll need or you'll be wearing a tube too.",38937,2
38938,"It was the right size but when I washed it in cold water, it shrank considerably.",38938,2
38938,I can still wear it but it's too short.,38938,2
38938,I had been hoping to wear it like a dress but a 66 year old woman can't get away with it.,38938,2
38938,A swimsuit cover up is all its good for.,38938,2
38939,"The necklace was a little bigger than I expected, and the chain in fairly long.",38939,2
38939,"I was disappointed that only two seeds came in the bulb, one of which was broken in half.",38939,2
38940,"I like the color of the shirt, but it is a bit on the cheap side for quality.",38940,2
38940,"I could live with that because of the price, but it wrinkles easily.",38940,2
38940,That is a deal killer for a daily work shirt.,38940,2
38940,"I don't want to iron it every time it is washed, so on the hanger it goes to probably be donated at a later time.",38940,2
38941,Leggings are too sheer.,38941,2
38941,I plan to return them.,38941,2
38942,Although it was constructed well for the price it was too large to slim.,38942,2
38942,Purchased the smallest size available and it was too large.,38942,2
38942,"Smallest hooks fit around 27"" waist but garment was too large to slim waist any further.",38942,2
38942,Just snug.,38942,2
38942,not slimming.,38942,2
38943,"I've only worn this item a few times and one of the steel bones is coming out at the bottom, wish I had returned it!",38943,2
38944,Not what I was expecting...,38944,2
38945,the coat was smaller than described and it took a long time to get it.,38945,2
38945,overall it was not like I thought in the description.,38945,2
38945,Was not worth the trouble to send it back.,38945,2
38946,I ordered this pendant and the one in the picture is what I recieved.,38946,2
38946,"It still looks nice but it's missing details such as the outer circle, the color of the symbol as well as even the necklace itself.",38946,2
38946,I am unsure id I had recieved a defective one?,38946,2
38946,Or if mine is just simply different on purpose but for the time being I am unatisfied and do not reccomend this.,38946,2

38948,I should have checked the sizes and where it was coming from.,38948,2
38948,Way too small.,38948,2
38949,This jacket was a beautiful jacket if it had only fit.,38949,2
38949,It was way tooooooo small.,38949,2
38949,I don't think it would even fit a child much let alone an adult.,38949,2
38950,After eagerly awaiting this product I must say I am disappointed with both the quality and design of the blouse.,38950,2
38950,Very scratchy label to the point that I have to cut it out to wear it.,38950,2
38950,The material is so heavy that they should have considered this while designing the over hang on the other side as the entire top pulls to one side and generally feels badly made.,38950,2
38950,"Well considering I bought the last one in stock on Amazon, good for the rest of you.",38950,2
38951,"Didn't sit right on my curvy body type, gave to a friend",38951,2

38959,"Though not ugly, nobody will confuse it for something better than it is.",38959,2

38962,Agreeing with the other reviews on the bad color.,38962,2
38962,We received these PJ's and although the waist and leg bands are red all the print is ORANGE!,38962,2

38969,She is 5'4 and 110 lbs so I ordered XS but didn't fit well.,38969,2
38969,Fabric is thick.,38969,2
38970,"Ok quality, but nothing special.",38970,2
38971,"This dress was really pretty, but it didn't fit as well as I had hoped.",38971,2
38971,The sleeves were too snug and the bodice was too low-cut.,38971,2
38972,At least two sizes too small,38972,2
38973,It fits A LOT snugger then it looks and I bought a size larger then I normally wear.,38973,2
38974,It's s cute blouse but the sizing is way off,38974,2
38975,Quality isn't good.,38975,2
38975,Looks extremely low quality.,38975,2
38976,"Disappointed, after an hour of wear all the links holding it together tarnished leaving green marks on my skin!",38976,2
38976,Beautiful necklace and came on time but not worth the tarnishing...it's a one time wear!,38976,2
38977,looks cheap,38977,2
38978,i purchased this dress for my wife.,38978,2
38978,"we tried to size it from the description, but it what to large.",38978,2
38978,after she tried it on she did not like the way it looked on her.,38978,2
38979,Not worth it unless you want a discussion piece.,38979,2
38979,"It's heavy, but this works against it.",38979,2
38979,The chain that is for the strap does not hold it.,38979,2
38979,"That, and one of the pictures shows the bird with an iPhone in it.",38979,2
38979,That doesn't fit.,38979,2
38979,"The gems are not stuck in there well, either.",38979,2
38979,"On one close, one popped off from the beak.",38979,2
38979,"They give you replacements, but I am ultimately disappointed.",38979,2
38979,"I wanted so badly to love this- it reminds me of the cucoos from Legend of Zelda, and I wanted this for my trip to the Symphony of the Goddess.",38979,2
38979,"Now I have to fix it, and the internal dimensions are squeezed where you cannot carry a small iPhone in there.",38979,2
38980,"Utility type bag, Not Fashion quality or look.",38980,2
38981,"Looks really cute in the picture, but unfortunately is made very poorly and the fit is quite small.",38981,2
38982,This dress was super cute on!,38982,2
38982,"But my turn off was that the material is very shiny and cheap looking, I returned it.",38982,2
38983,Too tight,38983,2
38984,They are easy to pull up and down.,38984,2
38984,"When they arrived, however, they reeked of chemicals.",38984,2
38984,I had to wash them several times before I felt comfortable enough to use them.,38984,2
38985,Took forever to get here.,38985,2
38985,Way to big!!!,38985,2
38985,Fits better around ankle that does a wrist - if it was worth my time & money I would send back -  but it was cheep - guess you get what you pay for,38985,2
38986,it was cut way tooo small.,38986,2
38986,Thankfully Amazon took care of the problem .,38986,2
38986,"I must say it is a very cute top, just way to small!",38986,2
38987,It looks quite lovely in the picture but not so much in the real when I received it.,38987,2
38987,It's a bit complicated to put on and heavy for a bathing suit.,38987,2
38987,It just wasn't for me.,38987,2
38988,While this is a well made product I'll have ask did anyone survey people to see how many cards people have to carry.,38988,2
38988,This is so tiny it doesn't come close to what I need.,38988,2
38988,"You have Medicare,ins,cards,drivers permit,AAA credit cards I mean really.",38988,2
38988,If they had done any homework this would have been a fantastic product.,38988,2
38988,I quess I will have to go back to my Shell-D or carry two of these.,38988,2
38988,Two bad.,38988,2
38989,They would be perfect if the design & stone part didn't fall off.,38989,2
38989,"The first time I glued it, the second time was in a dark parking garage so now I have to order another pair.",38989,2
38989,"Makes me sad, please make them better quality, i love these earrings.",38989,2
38990,"Im confused about this product, it states that the jacket is denim.",38990,2
38990,But when I received this in the mail - it is entirely a jersey type material - not denim at all (I purchased the black color).,38990,2
38990,"I went back to look to see if I missed something, but I cant find anywhere that says this is a jersey stretch material and NOT denim.",38990,2
38990,"Its cute, but felt like I paid a lot for something not great quality.",38990,2
38990,Im 52 and the small size is a little big and not a fitted look - but I have that problem with some clothes because of my height.,38990,2
38991,Arrived pretty quickly but the studs are pretty cheap in design.,38991,2
38991,The posts bend real easily.,38991,2
38992,The white dots that create friction on these gloves tear off very quickly.,38992,2
38992,"I wore a pair maybe 5 times for a barre class (read -- not too much stress on the hands, unlike some types of yoga or weight lifting), and a good chunk of the dots fell off.",38992,2
38992,Cheap and short-lived.,38992,2
38993,Very thin material and not long like it suggested.,38993,2
38993,I don't like worrying about my shirt coming up when I'm working out.,38993,2
38993,If you're okay with seeing skin and bra thru then it's a good product.,38993,2
38993,I like mine thicker and to hold shape.,38993,2
38994,This purse was cute just finally used it after purchase within 1/2 and hour the chain broke completely and I was unable to use it in my need.,38994,2
38994,Carrying it was a true pain.,38994,2
38994,"I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you plan on carrying it all over which I feel like it's way to big without the chain.",38994,2
38995,"I ordered a size larger because reviews said to, I should have order 3 sizes larger.",38995,2
38995,I normally wear an XL in the US and needed a Wisconson size for this to fit,38995,2
38996,The clothes is cheap and it was damaged in some parts.,38996,2
38996,The style id different than offered,38996,2
38997,Cheap.,38997,2
38997,Returned,38997,2
38998,This is stupid.,38998,2
38998,It says 8 slot however you get a 9 slot.,38998,2
38998,At least I did.,38998,2
38998,The problem is I wanted to store a larger testing stone in the 8 slot that won't fit in this 9 slot.,38998,2
38998,I don't have the time or patience to return stuff.,38998,2
38998,"Buyer beware, who knows what box you will get.",38998,2
38998,"As for the box itself, nothing special looks like something youd find at micheals in the cheap paint it your self boxes.",38998,2
38998,"They say to contact them before leaving bad feedback, they must have this problem of giving the wrong item alot as I have read ppl saying the acids were mislabeled but my test kit from them seems right so far.",38998,2
38999,"Pretty design, color and concept....just VERY thin.",38999,2
39000,"Yes, I was very excited when I first received these glasses.",39000,2
39000,"The lenses are great, and I could see perfectly on my morning commute which is always into the direction of the sun.",39000,2
39000,"Nothing wrong with the ""seeing"" part of these glasses.",39000,2
39000,"However, even after a short amount of time wearing these glasses, my ears are beginning to hurt.",39000,2
39000,Weird!,39000,2
39000,"I wear reading glasses during most of the day, and I wear other sun glasses as well, but I have never experienced this problem with any other glasses before.",39000,2
39000,"I tried giving the glasses away to a friend, but they had the same complaint.",39000,2
39000,That's the only reason I'm giving these glasses such a low ranking.,39000,2
39000,"******************************************************************************************************************
Please note: I purchased the glasses at full price myself.",39000,2
39000,No discount.,39000,2
39000,"The opinions expressed in this review is based on my personal, first-hand experience with this pair of glasses.",39000,2
39001,Made my nose sore after the first use.,39001,2
39001,"I also measured my nose as it said, but they were still too big.",39001,2
39001,Would have been cute if it didn't hurt to wear them.,39001,2
39002,Not really .,39002,2
39002,I expected way better quality material.,39002,2
39002,"It's a great picture but very flimsy material, if it had some kind of interior liner I would love it more, Lots of space and pockets",39002,2
39003,The jacket has an awesome style.,39003,2
39003,The material isn't impressive and the biggest disappointment is the color.,39003,2
39003,I chose the tan color and it looks almost yellowish.,39003,2
39003,Kind of a bummer.,39003,2
39004,It does not play well.,39004,2
39004,I like the idea of it but can see stitching and seams when you wear it.,39004,2
39005,First time that I'm dissappointed with an Amazon product.,39005,2
39005,I already ordered XL because of other reviews (normally I wear M-L) but even XL looks like a S-M to me.,39005,2
39005,Not impressed.,39005,2
39006,Won't order that style again,39006,2
39007,"Keep my sons hands stay dry and warm, but the gloves are very slim and the fingers are very long and we could not gets his fingers in there right.",39007,2
39008,The cases where not long enough for my sunglasses.,39008,2
39008,The case would not properly close.,39008,2
39008,Returning them.,39008,2
39009,Cheap material used on the outer layer.,39009,2
39009,Waist band not sewn properly to skirt in the back.,39009,2
39009,"Inner skirt much smaller than I expected but I was still able to get into it with about a 38"" hip measurement.",39009,2
39010,"Bottoms were too tight, and the top was WAY too big.",39010,2
39010,Bottoms also were rather high rise which I didn't expect.,39010,2
39010,"I went with a large after reading reviews, but the sizing was just off.",39010,2
39010,I'm a 34C cup and it was way too big.,39010,2
39010,Probably best for DD (or someone with a larger band size).,39010,2
39010,"I'm a size 4/6 on bottom, and large would've been better for a size 2/4 (smaller hips).",39010,2
39011,"Very tiny, not like the picture",39011,2
39012,Strange that its attached to a piece of paper (backing) to hold it together?,39012,2
39013,THE BUTTERFLY IS BIG LIKE 3 INCHES WIDE AND 2 INCHES LONG.,39013,2
39013,TAKE THE HOLD FRONT OF YOUR NECK.,39013,2
39013,TO BIG FOR MY TASTE..,39013,2
39014,"I read the reviews and went for a medium, I normally wear small for American size and medium for Asian size.",39014,2
39014,But this in medium is too big!,39014,2
39014,It is very comfortable and does look cute.,39014,2
39014,Will buy a small one!,39014,2
39015,"I read the reviews and knew I should be weary, but really liked it the look.",39015,2
39015,Too bad it didn't work out when I actually received the product.,39015,2
39015,"The overall fit was ok, not too big, not too small.",39015,2
39015,Now for details: the arms slots were a bit snug for my arms.,39015,2
39015,"I found myself having to adjust it just to get it unstuck from my arm (reference information, I wear medium in shirts, large in coats).",39015,2
39015,The buttons do unbutton and re-button so there was no problem getting in on.,39015,2
39015,"I really hate to say this, but it does look poorly made.",39015,2
39015,One of the shoulders was off on mine so it fell on my body in a way that the buttons presented as off center.,39015,2
39015,This also resulted in my left shoulder feeling a bit snug.,39015,2
39015,I decided it looked too awkward and am going to return it.,39015,2
39015,I really wanted to like it.,39015,2
39016,Did not stick very well.,39016,2
39016,It's maybe best for A-B cup.,39016,2
39016,Not good for C-D cup,39016,2
39017,The fabric feels bulky and uncomfortable.,39017,2
39017,Will return.,39017,2
39018,I bought two of these.,39018,2
39018,I'm not a fan.,39018,2
39018,Haven't worn them at all because they look cheaply made.,39018,2
39019,"We liked that they had the plastic clips but on the second day of my husband wearing them, one of the clips apparently lost its little metal piece that holds them together.",39019,2
39019,Needless to say we were very disappointed that they didn't last as long as the metal ones we were use to purchasing and for a whole lot less than what we paid for these.,39019,2
39020,Is too small,39020,2
39021,Recently bought this was disappointed.,39021,2
39021,I thought the plastic material would be thicker.,39021,2
39021,This tag is so thin it won't take anything at all to easily break in half.,39021,2
39021,It feels like thin cardboard,39021,2
39022,Read the reviews and ordered a size up.,39022,2
39022,The suit  is extremely short-waisted.,39022,2
39022,"Cute, but not true to size.",39022,2
39022,Disappointed in this purchase.,39022,2
39023,Was very disappointed in the quality of the coat.,39023,2
39023,Looks like a painted black garbage bad.,39023,2
39024,"They are very heavy , they looked worn when we got them, she had them on for the first time and her legs have scratches all over the boot opening.",39024,2
39024,They are going back,39024,2
39025,Too small but I gave it away,39025,2
39026,Upper Sleeve area too small in diameter.,39026,2
39026,Fabric good.,39026,2
39026,Color good.,39026,2
39026,Style just as described.,39026,2
39027,Top is too small.,39027,2
39028,This is way to long and the belt is crap.,39028,2
39028,"I'm 5'5"".",39028,2
39028,I'm going to have to do some alterations on this.,39028,2
39029,Ok but not very heart shaped,39029,2
39030,"Cute suit and great material, but it runs small.",39030,2
39030,"I'm a size 2....5'5""...and small was too small",39030,2
39031,I paid $30.86 for this hat and the tag has the price of $19.50!!!,39031,2
39031,Checked back to see the price and its dropped in the last week.,39031,2
39031,So disappointed in the quality and price of this product!,39031,2
39031,!,39031,2
39032,"It's beautiful and it does keep the sun from burning my dcollet, only problem is the glittery material that flakes off everywhere.",39032,2
39032,I gave it away to someone who's' eyes are less sensitive.,39032,2
39033,The swim suit top was not as thick as it should have been compared to other tops I had purchased with the same design so I was unable to wear it as shown in the pics because my breast keep popping out.,39033,2
39033,"Also, it was not the same color green as shown on the picture.",39033,2
39033,"For the price, I made it work but I was disappointed.",39033,2
39034,The outer surface has to clean it every time I really suggest you buy without finger prints.,39034,2
39034,I don't think will last as the opening press may gets loose,39034,2
39035,"Very cute but more loose than any other beanie I've purchased, design would be better with a rim or band around the entire bottom, falls off my head too easily.",39035,2
39036,"This dress was too small for me, even though I ordered based on the sizing chart measurements and looks cheaply made as well.",39036,2
39037,By chart I order size but it's no fit,39037,2
39038,Nice material but much smaller than expected - at least two sizes too small,39038,2
39039,not oversized as portrayed.,39039,2
39039,its half the size of an oversize scarf.,39039,2
39040,"The length was true to size and the shoes are adorable, BUT the back of the sandal is not rigid.",39040,2
39040,The shoe is very flimsy and my baby would just kick them off.,39040,2
39040,She couldn't walk in them as a result.,39040,2
39040,"If the back of the sandal had been rigid, this would not have been so much of a problem, but there was just no structure to the shoe.",39040,2
39040,Very disappointed.,39040,2
39040,"If they were made better, they would be adorable.",39040,2
39041,Damaged,39041,2
39042,"It's to transparent, the size it's well",39042,2
39043,Arrived with one flower broken and it needs to be repaired now.,39043,2
39044,"Was much too small, size I ordered should have fit, see if wife will wear it?",39044,2
39045,I had a size large from belly bandit.com and this size medium was wayyyy smaller than expected.,39045,2
39045,Its smaller than the one from the webite,39045,2
39046,Zipper broke after 4 weeks,39046,2
39047,Mens shorts sold in us should  fit men,39047,2
39048,None,39048,2
39049,This product is not as pictured.,39049,2
39049,I received two smaller separate bracelets instead of the pictured larger one.,39049,2
39049,The charms were not as pictured.,39049,2
39049,No hearts and two flags instead.,39049,2
39049,The words are legible only with a magnifying glass!,39049,2
39049,This was a disappointment.,39049,2
39049,It was too close to Christmas to return.,39049,2
39049,"My granddaughter put them on so I guess she was okay with them, but I am not okay with "" bait and switch""!",39049,2
39050,So I bought 2 the same size just different colors.,39050,2
39050,"The black fit fine though a little short for a dress, great with leggings.",39050,2
39050,The pink fit 2 sizes smaller.,39050,2
39050,It seems that the product is very inconsistent with there sizes.,39050,2
39050,Basically a gamble you might get a good fit or end up with something to big or to small.,39050,2
39051,Not true to size they run small,39051,2
39052,The letters are very small and hard to read.,39052,2
39052,The white color was bland!,39052,2
39053,I would order it two sizes bigger than what you usually wear!,39053,2
39053,I like the dress but the lace is not soft like it appears in the photo of the girl!,39053,2
39053,Beautiful still though especially with boots!,39053,2
39054,Very tight fit,39054,2
39055,I did not get the same case pictured.,39055,2
39055,Does not say Moschino on back and the front label is not the same.,39055,2
39055,Cool case for the price just not as pictured.,39055,2
39056,The design of this hat is really nice.,39056,2
39056,This hat is really poorly made though.,39056,2
39056,Fits weird too.,39056,2
39056,This would be a really nice house if it was made better.,39056,2
39057,Rather cheaply made and I am pretty sure the 4 leafed clover inside is fabric and not real.,39057,2
39057,This is definitely a get what you paid for item.,39057,2
39057,Ok for a novelty but I would never give as a gift or consider this real jewelry.,39057,2
39058,I wear a 10-12 so bought the XL and it is tiny.,39058,2
39058,I will be giving it to my 14 year old niece.,39058,2
39058,In the photo it looks generous in sizing and actually overlaps.,39058,2
39058,Mine won't even close.,39058,2
39058,"It's very pretty, just very small.",39058,2
39059,The top is too small,39059,2
39060,"We had ordered this for my wife 2 sizes larger after looking at size chart, It should fit a person with 50"" bust .",39060,2
39060,My lady is patite about 140#.,39060,2
39060,"and it would not fit around her shoulder's, no less cover chest.",39060,2
39060,Someone sure dos not know how to use a type measure.,39060,2
39061,"Nice fabric, but the sizing was way off!",39061,2
39061,"The dress said XL, but the actual fit was probably larger than a 3X or 4X!!!",39061,2
39061,"I realize that this cover-up is meant to be generous, but the generosity of fabric was overwhelming and the fit was awful.",39061,2
39061,I can't tell if this would work in a smaller size or not since this definitely was not an XL as labeled.,39061,2
39062,It was small on him,39062,2
39063,I would like to know what their large is for because it runs way to small,39063,2
39064,sizes are bad  poor constrution,39064,2
39065,It's a nice tshirt but the printing resolution is rather low and blurry.,39065,2
39065,For the price I wouldn't buy it.,39065,2
39065,If it was ten bucks it would be fine.,39065,2
39066,Same look as the picture but different material.,39066,2
39066,The links are much larger.,39066,2
39066,Would not purchase any others.,39066,2
39066,Worth a try though.,39066,2
39067,"For an XL, this was not the loose flowy fit I thought it to be.",39067,2
39067,I guess I expected it to at least be big comfortable.,39067,2
39067,I loved the elephant pattern though.,39067,2
39068,The purse appears to be bigger than it is.,39068,2
39068,Especially for 19.99 it should be bigger but so far so good,39068,2
39069,Never got wet and the gold color is coming off.,39069,2
39070,It seems like the size chart isn't the same for us in the USA.,39070,2
39071,Works ok but it falls open in the washing machine.,39071,2
39072,cheap just like the price and the color turned it looks dirty.,39072,2
39073,"The patterns are nice and the body material is soft, however the band is a regular elastic band and not comfortable.",39073,2
39073,"After reading the description, I thought the band would be covered in fabric to be as comfortable as the seller described.",39073,2
39073,It is regular elastic and irritates my skin.,39073,2
39073,"Also, I already had one pair rip after the second wear and wash. For the price, I am very disappointed in the quality.",39073,2
39073,"Based on the how the first pair fell apart, I do not expect the others to last very long either.",39073,2
39073,I will not be buying this brand again.,39073,2
39074,very sheer not like the picture,39074,2
39075,I ordered up a size and it would not fit around the but.,39075,2
39075,"The odd thing is that this was almost 8"" too long.",39075,2
39075,"The top is not lined, sewing quality could be improved and the fabric is too sheer to wear without a full slip.",39075,2
39075,"Not well designed, but cute style.",39075,2
39075,Ended up returning it - there was no way to make this wearable.,39075,2
39076,Way too small!,39076,2
39076,"Really cute top, but sizing is way way off.",39076,2
39077,The white is see through.,39077,2
39077,Save your money.,39077,2
39077,Not worth it.,39077,2
39078,I went for the US 6 and Im sad to find it's too big on me.,39078,2
39078,Its especially too wide in the shoulders.,39078,2
39078,It's also completely see through.,39078,2
39078,"I expect that a little with white, but this is totally sheer.",39078,2
39078,The collar fits weird on me.,39078,2
39078,What a shame.,39078,2
39079,They are cute but they broke as soon as we picked them out of the box.,39079,2
39079,They were supposed to be a birthday present for my daughter's friend.,39079,2
39079,We had to throw them away the day we got them :(,39079,2
39080,This shirt took far longer than expected to get to me.,39080,2
39080,"Over a week longer, so I'm glad I ordered in August for October.",39080,2
39080,The white of the Jack Daniel's label looks far more blue than white.,39080,2
39080,"I'm glad this is for a Halloween costume so it will do, but if this was for a gift for someone who really likes Jack then I'd be pissed.",39080,2
39080,"I have actual official Jack Daniels shirts but for myself and they are of a far better quality than what I got, so I'm going to go with this is not official and we are being lied to.",39080,2
39080,"The material is soft and comfortable, but I don't think my husband will wear it for anything other than Halloween.",39080,2
39080,We are HUGE fans of Jack and this does not accurately depict the quality of their other products.,39080,2
39081,Runs really small had to return my roper.,39081,2
39081,I wish there were larger sizes.,39081,2
39082,There isn't enough material in the front panels to offer any coverage.,39082,2
39082,The length is nice but the sleeves are too short for me.,39082,2
39082,"The fabric seems nice, but wrinkles easily.",39082,2
39082,This will be returned.,39082,2
39083,"i read the other reviews about this item being too small, so i ordered 2 sizes up and it was still ill fitting: tight in some areas loose in others.",39083,2
39083,it just didn't fit right.,39083,2
39083,i plan to give it away.,39083,2
39084,Like the style but the boob part is not has tight.,39084,2

39085,"Sleeves were short for the size, fit small for the size.",39085,2
39085,The size I ordered is usually VERY roomy on me.,39085,2
39085,The hunt for a Great White (shirt) continues...,39085,2
39086,Too hard to insert into my nose.,39086,2
39087,"Colors appeared very faded upon arrival, and was poor quality.",39087,2
39087,Did not expect that for the price.,39087,2
39088,"horribly made, and for tiny women.",39088,2
39089,"My review could be taken word-for-word from the one written by Joanne Ackerman on October 19, 2015.",39089,2
39089,I wanted an inexpensive washable large sweater to lounge around in when it's drafty and was searching through sweaters for large women when I found this listing.,39089,2
39089,"It says ""Bust: 38.58-44.09 inches"" which is why I ordered it, but these must be different inches than I am used to as one look at the sweater was enough for me to know it would never fit.",39089,2
39089,Even the sleeves are much too small in diameter (and short) for adult arms.,39089,2
39089,It looks lovely and seems to be well-made (I didn't wash it so I don't know how it reacts to that) so I gave it two stars for appearance.,39089,2
39089,"I do wonder, however, why it is labeled ""apricot"" as it is a nice beige, as the picture shows.",39089,2
39089,"Returning it would have been a hassle, so I gave it to a friend of mine, FOR HER DAUGHTER...",39089,2
39090,Cute ordered two but one fell apart within a day.... disappointed.,39090,2
39091,"I was disappointed with this suit especially the top; it was hanging for my size 34B bust, and the sides of my breast was exposed.",39091,2
39091,"The material is not polyester+spandex as stated in the product description, it is suede+spandex.",39091,2
39092,Way too small.,39092,2
39092,Ordering 2 sizes up didn't cut it.,39092,2
39092,I ordered the XXL hoping it would be big and flowy like the picture.,39092,2
39092,"When it arrived, it looked like a small.",39092,2
39092,The back of the shirt was pretty but the front would not have hung nicely even if it would have fit.,39092,2
39093,The material is very thing so the pants have a cheap look and the length is too long.,39093,2
39094,"Sizing is all over the place, some fit and some were too small so you better order at least a size larger.",39094,2
39095,Cute but too small for the size listed.,39095,2
39095,And my son is of average size.,39095,2
39096,Bad quality,39096,2
39097,More off-white then white.,39097,2
39097,"Fits nice,though.",39097,2
39098,The dress fits but the size of the underslip is WAY off.,39098,2
39098,It seems like the underslip is for a size Med and I ordered a much bigger size.,39098,2
39098,It makes it so I can't wear it because the slip doesn't cover my butt.,39098,2
39098,Very disappointing.,39098,2
39099,the gem came out and hte side pieces bent within a month of having it.,39099,2
39100,Too large,39100,2
39101,"Cute, but, unfortunately the glue under the glass marred the kitty's eyes...on both the necklaces I purchased.",39101,2
39102,Running small is an understatement.,39102,2
39102,They run REALLY small.,39102,2
39102,I am normally a medium and I got a large..,39102,2
39102,They literally wouldn't even go around my body.,39102,2
39103,Way to small even my grandaughter could not wear.,39103,2
39104,This detailed trim really is adorable however it's such thin material!,39104,2
39104,Great for summer yes but it stretches out and wrinkles so badly.,39104,2
39104,It looked awful by the end of the day.,39104,2
39105,Did not fit right around my belly.,39105,2
39105,Too small.,39105,2
39105,Doesn't slouch like in the picture,39105,2
39106,"If they don't fit, returning them will cost nearly the price of the shoes in the end.",39106,2
39106,"They also have a bit of a high heel FYI, if you're considering them for a small child.",39106,2
39107,Very cheaply made.,39107,2
39107,Fell apart instantly and were damaged.,39107,2
39107,I think I'll just go to the store for our nest next party.,39107,2
39108,"I like the shoes however, they run small.",39108,2
39108,"I wear a 7.5 think I needed a 8.5.  with the wide front, your feet will slide forward after an hour of wearing.",39108,2
39109,never again,39109,2
39110,The D rings are too big.,39110,2
39111,The belt looks very cheep and it runs very small in size.,39111,2

39113,Don't know any man who would actually carry it.,39113,2
39113,Also weak zipper.,39113,2

39115,Way to small...,39115,2
39115,"I recommend defiantly going up a size if buying, you won't regret it!",39115,2
39115,!....what you will regret is buying a size that's the kids size...... go bigger with this outfit!!!,39115,2
39115,!,39115,2
39116,The hat was ok but the way it was bent to be shipped caused it to be permanently bent weird and so it looks really weird on.,39116,2
39116,It's even hard to get it at an angle that works for gardening because it either isn't blocking the sun effectively or its in your eyes.,39116,2
39117,"Was really cute, but it hung so far below my septum I had to return it.",39117,2
39117,"But if roomy rings are your thing, then you'll probably like it.",39117,2
39118,Tarnished very quickly.,39118,2
39118,But for the price it bad.,39118,2
39119,These were not the same quality as the ones I purchased from TJ MAXX.,39119,2
39119,They are much thinner and the stitching held up all of 2 workouts.,39119,2
39119,I wouldn't purchase these again.,39119,2
39120,"I bought this Ray-Ban Junior RJ9506S Aviator Sunglasses for my very narrow faced son, and it was too small.",39120,2

39120,Not a 16 year old,39120,2
39121,returned this item.,39121,2
39121,the material was flimsy ad nothing like how it was described online.,39121,2
39122,I'm a 36D size so I ordered an XL.,39122,2
39122,It was too snug and left marks on my skin when I took it off later that day.,39122,2
39122,"Also, every single insert pad came apart in the wash (on gentle).",39122,2
39122,These ship from China Post but they didn't take as long as I had expected.,39122,2
39123,Big warning - the tail is not printed on the back as pictured but is printed on the front.,39123,2
39123,My 4 year old still liked it but it does raise some interesting questions from other kids on why his shirt is on backwards.,39123,2
39124,These are pretty small.,39124,2
39124,Good if your piercing has a small gauge.,39124,2

39126,The return process was done very well but instead of purchasing from them I went and got a better dress shirt.,39126,2
39126,The material while plentiful was not very good.,39126,2
39126,The cuff links and buttons were very nice though.,39126,2

39127,I wear a US size 6/8 with a small chest.,39127,2
39127,"I was hoping the coverup would drape the way it does in the picture, but it made me look like I was wrapped in a sausage casing.",39127,2
39127,"Unless you are uber petite and don't mind the cheap fabric, I would not recommend.",39127,2
39128,way to small for xl,39128,2

39134,"When it arrived, it more resembled a size 1XL.",39134,2
39134,VERY small.,39134,2
39134,"The tag looked to be written in Korean, so perhaps this is a 4XL in Korea?",39134,2
39134,Certainly not for this gal.,39134,2
39135,really small.,39135,2
39135,haven't worn it,39135,2
39136,I ordered my size just a half inch bigger and they are to small .,39136,2
39136,The material is cheap made.,39136,2
39136,They are uncomfortable.,39136,2
39136,I use to wear a pair of these.,39136,2
39136,In a different brand years ago .,39136,2
39136,I loved those but these are alot different in size and very thin .,39136,2
39136,Had to send them back and order a different pair .,39136,2
39137,Cowl hangs way too low.,39137,2
39137,Cannot wear without tucking in the back.,39137,2

39143,Nice shirt but the sizes are very very small almost like a child's shirt.,39143,2
39143,Very disappointed,39143,2
39144,It doesn't hold you as tight as it should,39144,2
39145,"Not worth it, bra is cheap and looks funny in the back, garter clips are cheap, stockings don't go up as far as they should",39145,2
39146,"Beautiful colors and material but fits horribly, nothing like how it would appear in the picture.",39146,2
39147,It fits weird.,39147,2
39147,Does not fit a regular size maybe if you were far eastern person it will fit you fine.,39147,2
39147,As far as for me it looked horrible.,39147,2
39148,It will shrink!,39148,2
39149,Too small,39149,2
39150,"Returned, this was very short and wide.",39150,2
39151,"I bought a medium because most of the reviews were saying it was a little large but I don't think that's really the issue, the bottoms fit well although a little shorter than I'd like but they are pjs.",39151,2
39151,The top is what is too large I can sew it up to fix it but I feel like it hangs too low the arms are too big so it's almost like a muscle tank top.,39151,2
39151,Which is fine but if I may be honest it twists around so much I have things hangin out that I don't really want hangin out.,39151,2
39151,It's also pretty cheap material...,39151,2
39152,"Normally wear an 18W or 1X, 44D-DD.",39152,2
39152,"Per the reviews, ordered a 5X.",39152,2
39152,The bib is the problem.,39152,2
39152,"The blouse fits just fine everywhere else, but the bib is so small that you have no chance of fitting the girls in there.",39152,2
39152,They're just sort of squeezed out onto your stomach in a look that is extremely unflattering and isn't going to catch on real soon.,39152,2
39152,Feels a lot like having a mammogram.,39152,2
39153,Very small and no give material,39153,2
39154,gift broke around her wrist.,39154,2
39155,"I have this top in black, same size-black fits great, this one is tight across hips!",39155,2

39155,!,39155,2
39156,My poor review is re: quality assurance.,39156,2
39156,I tried the outfit on and was satisfied with the fit and length UNTIL I tried to button the sleeves.,39156,2
39156,"Someone sewed the buttons on the right cuff on the wrong side and I can't button the sleeve And obviously, no one cared or caught it before  shipping.",39156,2
39156,The buttons are not the kinds that I can remove and sew on myself (nor should I have to find matching thread and time to correct what should have been corrected before shipping.),39156,2
39156,This is for our Luau party in three days so return and replacement will be too late.,39156,2
39156,See the attached pics showing both sleeve to see that one sleeve has buttons on the wrong side.,39156,2
39157,"Nice Bag, however already the front snap lock is not staying- even though I snapped it shut, it has opened and all stuff came out (once in an airport).",39157,2
39158,At first the pants were great.,39158,2
39158,They fit perfectly and were comfortable.,39158,2
39158,Now almost 6 months later they have shrunk to the point that I cannot wear them anymore.,39158,2
39158,I'm really bummed because I was hoping they'd last for a few years.,39158,2
39159,Inside very poorly made.,39159,2
39159,"Lining were not to the bottom of the bag, had to cut the bottom out of the material in order to use it, the leather is very hard.",39159,2
39159,Other than that the bag is we'll made.,39159,2
39159,"I would not recommend this bag to any one, the workmanship is too sloppy.",39159,2
39160,"came apart after 2months, zipper and all",39160,2
39161,Sizing is always hard on the internet.,39161,2
39161,Inches must be different in different situation.,39161,2
39161,It is disappointing,39161,2
39162,These run small.,39162,2
39162,May husband wears a 38x36 and he couldn't even button these.,39162,2
39163,After 30 days they no longer hold.,39163,2
39163,The clamps are weak.,39163,2
39164,Sun glasses feel of cheaply made plastic although they look very stylish.,39164,2
39164,"Also, although they are advertised as being for small faces, the lenses are relatively large.",39164,2
39165,Have to give this one away,39165,2
39166,The size run very small for what is listed,39166,2
39167,It is nice but I feel that it just doesn't look as good on.,39167,2
39168,This shirt is extremely small.,39168,2
39168,"Says large, and it took 23 days to arrives.",39168,2
39169,It is only hook and eye closure.,39169,2
39169,Not corset.,39169,2
39170,Nice,39170,2
39171,It was ok.,39171,2
39171,The wheels are cheaply made.,39171,2
39171,I got what I paid for.,39171,2
39172,The ruching at chest level was not sewn properly as it was coming apart before I even put it on.,39172,2
39172,"The bottom piece of the suit was not sewn at all, it was left unfinished.",39172,2
39173,The shorts wouldn't have fit a small child.,39173,2
39174,Not true to size,39174,2
39175,Fits good but it arrived ripped.,39175,2
39175,"I only paid $30 for it and the wedding I have to go to is in a week, so I'm going to keep it.",39175,2
39175,Thankfully since it's dark blue you really can't tell.,39175,2
39175,It's to be expected too with the price tag so not that disappointed over all,39175,2
39176,Was not linen or cotton but a synthetic fabric.,39176,2
39177,"Too revealing, short, and wide in the hips!",39177,2
39177,Not my cup of tea.,39177,2
39178,Beware these are glasses not goggles!,39178,2
39179,Very very small and uncomfortable.,39179,2
39179,Recommend buying elsewhere,39179,2
39180,DON'T  LIKE LOOK UGLY,39180,2
39181,"At first, I ordered a small, as the circumference of my hips and bust are both about 35''.",39181,2
39181,The bikini was far too small.,39181,2
39181,I then returned it and ordered a medium.,39181,2

39181,"I'm disappointed, because I really wanted to like these, but I won't be ordering again for another replacement.",39181,2

39184,"Nice, but it didn't fit",39184,2
39185,These fit poorly in the thighs and were too short (by a good inch or so).,39185,2

39188,"I aired it out and placed downy sheets, freeze, Lysol and so on and the odor lingers.",39188,2
39188,I am very sensitive to smells and odors.,39188,2

39190,I love the color and design of the dress however I was disappointed when my size medium dress came in looking like a tshirt on me.,39190,2
39190,If I were to lift up my arms my crotch would be visible.,39190,2
39190,Wish I could have had success like some of the other posts here.,39190,2
39190,I will be returning my order.,39190,2
39191,They need to let you know the sizes run small,39191,2

39194,The sleeves are correct length but the shoulders too wide,39194,2
39195,Top WAY too small could fit a child...,39195,2
39195,Kept bottoms they were a decent size,39195,2
39196,"I really like the looking of this bag and after a couple of weeks, the leather hold for crossing body were broken.",39196,2

39205,Beautiful piece but only had it on for an hour and then it broke.,39205,2
39206,VERY POOR QUALITY.,39206,2
39206,"I bought 2, the metal is thin and cheap.",39206,2
39206,I guess they are pretty if you don't look to closely at them.,39206,2
39206,I've never had stainless steel jewelry that looks or feels like these.,39206,2
39207,"When I received it and put it on, I was appalled at the design of the hood.",39207,2
39207,The website photo hides the fact that the drawstring shows at the top edge of the hood.,39207,2
39207,It looks really silly.,39207,2
39207,I am returning it.,39207,2
39208,Small and wide looks good on females not guys,39208,2
39209,I bought the infant size.,39209,2
39209,"Large brim, adjustable around the head.",39209,2
39209,But very floppy and still too big for my (small) 11 mo old.,39209,2
39209,She won't wear it longer than a minute.,39209,2
39209,Hopefully she grows into it..?,39209,2
39210,I ordered this item because it looked so nice.,39210,2
39210,When this item arrived the material felt like it was going to melt in my hands.,39210,2
39210,It's a charming garment but I don't like the way the material feels.,39210,2
39211,"very thin material, and runs very small",39211,2
39212,Weird cut - It falls strange in the back.,39212,2
39213,These seemed to be the perfect solution for my sensitive ears without a headband.,39213,2
39213,"Unfortunately, they simply refuse to stay on.",39213,2
39213,Every time I turned my head to either side they fell off.,39213,2
39213,Would not recommend them.,39213,2
39214,The waist is really generous and the cut for the legs is really wide.,39214,2
39214,Keep in mind there is no drawstring in the waist either so they are really big,39214,2
39215,I generally wear a US small or medium.,39215,2
39215,Ordered XL and it is small.,39215,2
39215,Have ordered up on many imported items lately and honestly do not know their sizing or what retail stores carry these products.,39215,2
39215,Material is thin and not as colorful as pictured.,39215,2
39215,Will gift it to a teen that wears a size 5 at most.,39215,2
39215,Will take care in future orders.,39215,2
39215,Item is worth half of cost IMHO.,39215,2
39216,"I  don't know where to start...I can't tell you about the fit because it doesn't say anywhere on the  garment,  I looked on my invoice,  no size there either, so maybe it's a  one size fits most.",39216,2
39216,"Fabric is soft and silky,  reminds me of pajamas,  which is what I will wear it as, because it's not quite nice enough for out....The lavender color was very pretty,  but one of the buttons was off colored from the rest.",39216,2
39216,"Cute concept,  to bad it just doesn't work",39216,2
39217,"Bought for a head diameter measuring about 51"", but was way too big.",39217,2
39217,"The elastic of the band is very subtle; this is I guess so the pressure isn't too much and cause discomfort, but in practice, it slips off the head easily.",39217,2
39217,"The material of the band holds on to hers and scarves well, but the band itself slips off.",39217,2
39217,Did not work for my use so it was returned.,39217,2
39218,Much cheaper looking in person.,39218,2
39219,Very light weight and thin.,39219,2
39219,Collar rolls down is very large compared to body of poncho,39219,2
39220,This just arrived and I should have known what I was going to get.,39220,2
39220,"The sequins are smaller than they appeared in the photo, and keep falling off.",39220,2
39220,They are not a nice yellow gold.,39220,2
39220,They are dulled.,39220,2
39220,You can see the fabric underneath.,39220,2
39220,"I bought a XXL and it seemed a little tight on me, or I'm just fatter than I think i am.",39220,2
39220,I have pictures I will post once I figure that part out,39220,2
39221,Strapped ripped first week used,39221,2
39222,The item is wayyy to big and really thin.,39222,2
39223,This turned me green after two short wears (Under six hours each).,39223,2
39223,"I know for the price some materials are not made to last, but I expect a little more than this.",39223,2
39224,"Cute print, and the quality of material / stitching is to be expected.",39224,2
39224,"However, the bottom of the dress is totally unfinished...like it was cut with scissors then just shipped!",39224,2
39224,I don't know if that is intentional or if this was a mistake-- either way I have never seen anything like this before.,39224,2
39225,"Was larger then expected and cost $30 to return and still after 4 weeks have not received a credit from this company, The dress was ok but not a favorite but still pretty.",39225,2
39226,change the colors so fast,39226,2
39227,"Was too small , nice looking shirts but the fit was off give a 2 sta",39227,2
39228,Product runs small.,39228,2
39229,Really wrong size,39229,2
39230,"Ordered an XL, one size up from normal, after reading the reviews.",39230,2

39230,"165 lbs, wear a 38B bra.",39230,2
39230,"The dress was so tight in the bust I felt I needed another 2-3"" of fabric.",39230,2
39230,The waist is tight as well.,39230,2
39230,Lengthwise it came to about mid calf.,39230,2
39230,Fabric is wonderfully soft and the dress is pretty.,39230,2
39230,"I'm returning it but I'm not ordering the XXL, it might be too small as well.",39230,2
39230,Another minus was that it took 23 days from order to delivery.,39230,2
39230,From NJ to GA!,39230,2
39231,Pockets not wide enough.,39231,2
39231,Would not buy it again.,39231,2
39232,Would be cute... if I was a stick figure : (,39232,2
39233,I saw this dress and wanted it for my daughter .,39233,2
39233,"While it did fit very well, but the qualify of the dress is ok and I am afraid that the skirt will not hold up and may shrink after few washes.",39233,2
39234,"The material is very thin and translucent, you can see your cheeks.",39234,2
39234,They were sewn badly in one are and it caused them to be tighter on the left side than they were on the right.,39234,2
39235,"WAY TOO SMALL, BY AT LEAST 2 SIZES!",39235,2
39236,To small,39236,2
39237,Not what I expected from the description.,39237,2
39237,The inside shell is not a shell at all but a cheap t-shirt.,39237,2
39237,If I could I'd send it back!,39237,2
39238,Good,39238,2
39239,The elastic is really cheap and loose.,39239,2
39239,They're cute but they won't last long.,39239,2
39240,"It's cute and soft, but that's the only positive the sizing is totally off!",39240,2
39240,I ordered a 2t and 5/6 the slippers are the exact same size!,39240,2
39240,The robes both fit my 6 year old.,39240,2
39240,So for my 6 year old the slippers are tiny and on my 2 year old the robe is huge,39240,2
39241,Too long!,39241,2
39241,It doesn't fit nice looking......,39241,2
39242,"I really thought the words ""Touch LED Watch"" was a peel off clear film on the watch, but its part of the watch.",39242,2
39242,Received it very timely.,39242,2
39242,but after two weeks LED is dim and don't keep correct time.,39242,2
39243,There not dark at all,39243,2
39244,"Slightly small, cheap material.",39244,2
39245,Its only a one size fits all if your very small.,39245,2
39246,"I am surprised by the positive reviews, as I did not like this at all.",39246,2
39246,"The material was strange - like athletic wear, and there wasn't really enough fabric to look 'right' when looped twice.",39246,2
39246,"Even at $18, which is a lot less than other scarves with pockets, I felt like it was too much for what it is.",39246,2
39246,I returned it instantly.,39246,2
39247,I am sorry but this did not meet my expectations.,39247,2
39247,It is very pretty and what I wanted.,39247,2
39247,"But, the first time I used it the pocket for my drivers license tore.",39247,2
39247,"As many of you know, when traveling you are asked and required to show your picture ID many times, consequently this was unfortunate to have it tear as that is the last thing you need falling out of your wallet.",39247,2
39248,Quality is very good.,39248,2
39248,But the sizing  is horrible I bought this for girl.,39248,2
39248,"She is a medium with a slider model type build,  and the shirt was way to tight order larger size and you should be fine.",39248,2
39249,"Awesome looking bathing suit, but the top was weirdly tight on my boobs.",39249,2
39249,"I'm a 34D and it like pressed in on them and my under boob wasn't all in the cup, like it also went into the middle part of the top where the zipper is.",39249,2
39249,"Unfortunate, because it is cute!",39249,2
39249,!,39249,2
39250,Not as nice as it looks in picture.,39250,2
39251,After reading reviews that the sizing runs small I over compensated and bought an XL for someone who doesn't normally wear that size.,39251,2
39251,"I purchased this as a gift, it was waaaay too big.",39251,2
39251,I would suggest buying closer to the size you think you are.,39251,2
39251,:),39251,2
39252,"While the jacket looked good, it is cut small.",39252,2
39252,"If your arms have any muscle in them, the jacket fits tightly.",39252,2
39252,You'd  only be able to wear a short sleeve shirt or tank top with no issue.,39252,2
39252,The return process was smooth and expedient.,39252,2
39253,I guess you get what you pay for .,39253,2
39253,.,39253,2
39253,.,39253,2
39253,"I thought this dress might work for a family photo shoot I had coming up, but it just wasn't right.",39253,2
39253,"Not only did it run small, it was, um, unflattering, in lots of places.",39253,2
39253,"The material is light, cheap, and clingy - it would probably look nice on someone with no curves .",39253,2
39253,.,39253,2
39253,.,39253,2
39253,but don't expect to get more than a few wears out of it.,39253,2
39254,Very baggy,39254,2
39255,Worked GREAT as a beach bag but it was way too big and awkward as a carry-on.,39255,2
39256,poor quality but my son loves it.,39256,2
39257,The item you will receive is different than pictured.,39257,2
39257,2 times I received the wrong style.,39257,2
39257,The sock material is way too stretchy and doesn't hold well.,39257,2
39258,It came with a tear in it in an odd place.,39258,2
39258,It seemed a bit small for the measurements.,39258,2
39259,"The fit was great, the length was perfect.",39259,2
39259,My only complaint was that it is see through.,39259,2
39260,See through when wet.,39260,2
39261,It looks okay but fits sort of weirdly.,39261,2
39261,"Like others have said, it is tighter at the bottom so it kept riding up.",39261,2
39261,I also expected to be able to nurse in it because it looked like it would be easy to pull up but it isn't.,39261,2
39261,It is much too tight at the bottom.,39261,2
39261,It is also made out of a kind of plasticky feeling material so it isn't comfortable at all.,39261,2
39262,"Cute set, BUT ... 2 of them were damaged.",39262,2
39262,"As the photo shows, the paint on them were scuffed off which ruins the whole picture.",39262,2
39262,"Too bad, it would have to be returned.",39262,2
39263,The color is more red than burgundy.,39263,2
39264,the print was fine do not dry this shirt or you'll be giving this shirt to your child it shrinks alot,39264,2
39265,its not only small but also a little short.,39265,2
39266,I bought these to go with my leprechaun costume for Lucky this weekend.,39266,2
39266,I was thrilled at the craftsmanship of the crystal lenses but the hinges worried me.,39266,2
39266,"Sure enough, one of the hinges broke the first time I took the glasses off in the first five minutes of getting in the event.",39266,2
39266,I had high hopes for these and I was hoping to see if the Glo FX booth at the event was understanding to give me a free pair but I wasn't so lucky haha.,39266,2
39266,I had an incredible night anyhow!,39266,2
39266,!,39266,2
39267,Small small small,39267,2
39268,Two stars for being cute and soft fabric.,39268,2
39268,"But the sewing is horrible, and I'm not even picky.",39268,2
39268,"I took off stars because the buttons are hot glued onto the red tie, and there were strings of dried glue all over the tie because of it.",39268,2
39268,"If you hold up the pants to the light, the back and front seams are loosely sewn together and you can see daylight from the gaps in the seam.",39268,2
39268,I could even see my son's diaper pattern through the holes in the seam when he put these pants on.,39268,2
39268,"There are no care instructions on the shirt or pants, so I have no idea how to wash these but I'm guessing I don't - this seems like a one time outfit, to wear once and not wash or it will fall apart.",39268,2
39268,"The ""idgirl"" tag sewn onto the hem of the shirt was sewn on hastily and crooked, and I had to cut it off because it stuck out from under the shirt.",39268,2
39268,"The tie is loosely sewn on to the shirt, and I was able to use just my fingers to pull it off (which I had to do, to fully remove the glue strings).",39268,2
39268,The shirt actually works better without the tie.,39268,2
39268,"For the price, all of this is to be expected, but the quality is so low I wouldn't use this for a formal event like a wedding.",39268,2
39268,It's more suited to a quick Easter egg hunt or an hour long visit with family.,39268,2
39268,"I ordered the size 4T, and the small size label inside the shirt read ""XL"".",39268,2
39269,Way too big.,39269,2
39269,I ordered a small and it is huge.,39269,2
39269,I really liked this shirt but can't wear it:(,39269,2
39270,"So, this thing truly is sheer....I seen that in the description but wasn't aware how sheer.",39270,2
39270,The only parts not exposed on this dress are the vag and the crack!,39270,2
39270,"I'm kind of old school and believe in leaving some things to the imagination, so I had to return it.",39270,2
39271,Shirt was way too small.,39271,2
39271,It also didn't look like what I ordered.,39271,2
39272,The style was nice but this is not true to size.,39272,2
39272,I ended up keeping it because it cost too much to ship back.,39272,2
39273,It's a very nice top but way too small even ordering 2 sizes larger than I normally do because of other reviews I read.,39273,2
39273,I normally wear a L and I ordered the 2X but it was not enough.,39273,2
39273,I wish it fit!,39273,2
39274,Bright colors however very low quality.,39274,2
39274,I purchased this a few months ago and it still sits in my jewelry box.,39274,2
39274,Many times you pay for what you get.,39274,2
39275,I selected the size based on the chart provided and it fits fairly well but it looks nothing like the picture.,39275,2
39275,The pink portion which is to give the impression of curves run in the immediate front of the dress.,39275,2
39275,"In addition, the finish is untidy.",39275,2
39275,Wouldn't purchase again.,39275,2
39276,The smell of the product is awful and the lake blue color is not even similar to the color shown.,39276,2
39276,The strap is VERY cheaplt made as well.,39276,2
39276,Returning this product.,39276,2
39277,Nice vibrant colors.,39277,2
39277,Too bad I took the first pair out to wear and there were already 2 holes in them.,39277,2
39278,While I initially loved the blouse the bow in the middle quickly unraveled making a great mess of the thing.,39278,2
39278,I only got to wear it twice.,39278,2
39279,"Nice product, but way too small for a MED/LRG",39279,2
39280,Didn't like it.,39280,2
39281,It was too small so order two sizes bigger.,39281,2
39282,Not true to size.,39282,2
39282,Have tried two different ones.,39282,2
39282,Baby well below weight and age listed.,39282,2
39282,Fabric and quality very nice.,39282,2
39283,"It's likely that I won't even wear it, because the ""star"" gem is so small and the prongs are so big that you can't even tell what the shape of the gem is supposed to be.",39283,2
39283,It looks like a silver blob with tiny red highlights.,39283,2
39283,I'm really unhappy with this purchase.,39283,2
39284,Looks great!,39284,2
39284,"However, smells really, really terrible.",39284,2
39284,"I bought 3 colors, black, red, and brown.",39284,2
39284,"I have used many different methods to try and deodorize them, including backing soda, water, soap, vinegar, scented candles, and scented oils.",39284,2
39284,NOTHING WORKED.,39284,2
39284,They are unwearable.,39284,2
39284,The smell does not even smell natural either.,39284,2
39284,They can be smelled from a distance of up to 8 feet even.,39284,2
39284,The smell won't even leave my room.,39284,2
39284,Really disappointing because of how great they look.,39284,2
39285,runs big,39285,2
39286,Nice but size was much too small,39286,2
39287,"It looks really cheap - does not look like ""Genuine Turquoise"" as described.",39287,2
39288,Shirt is very cheaply done and the sizing is about 4 sizes off.,39288,2
39288,Very disappointing.,39288,2
39289,"This t-shirt has a very weird, goofy fit due to the short but widely-protruding sleeves, which stick out to the sides to a comical degree.",39289,2
39289,"Torso length is not excessive in size M. I'm 5'7, 150--not a bulky dude by any means.",39289,2
39289,"Fabric quality seems to be okay, but the fit?",39289,2
39289,Too strange.,39289,2
39290,Already turned colors 24hrs later.,39290,2
39290,:(,39290,2
39291,The XL fits like a M,39291,2
39292,They say they are made of stainless steel but I doubt that because they irritated my skin within hours of wearing them.,39292,2
39292,My ears are always sensitive to cheap earrings but not stainless steel so..... the CZ is nice looking but I don't love the setting.,39292,2
39292,I really bought them for my daughters but not sure if they will be able to wear them either due to sensitivity.,39292,2
39292,These were super cheap so my expectations weren't high to begin with!,39292,2
39293,The fabric is heavier than I like and seemed to faded on the collar and the fold line.,39293,2
39294,Beautiful dress but I wear a 12-14 and the XXL was so small I was unable to even get it on.,39294,2
39294,Horrible sizing.,39294,2
39294,My daughter is a 6 and did manage to get the XXL size on.,39294,2
39295,Loved it but it broke w in a wk,39295,2
39296,"The shoes don't fit very well, and the inner lining came out pretty quickly.",39296,2
39296,Threw them out.,39296,2
39297,Don't.,39297,2
39297,Very cheap looking.,39297,2
39298,"Got a rip on the shoulder with only one wash, never had clothes that did that.",39298,2
39298,Poor sewing.,39298,2
39298,Cute though.,39298,2
39298,"My son's torso is long but legs and feet aren't as much, so this didn't fit right due to the legs and feet being to big.",39298,2
39299,they fall apart after one use,39299,2
39300,"disappointed with the dress, I usually can fit into a M and a L and it was still too small,gave to a friend.",39300,2
39301,"This ""dress"" cannot really be worn as a dress.",39301,2
39301,It is a see thru ribbed fabric that has a nice feel to it.,39301,2
39301,"The small was definitely more like an extra small and the built in bra shelf wasn't completed and is only 3"" in all.",39301,2
39301,It makes a good slip for under dresses.,39301,2
39302,The size I ordered was too small.,39302,2
39302,Almost two sizes.,39302,2
39303,These boots are far too small and extremely difficult for a little one to get his feet in.,39303,2
39304,They are huge.,39304,2
39304,"They were a little large on size than I expected, but the design is like they finish on the belly button",39304,2
39305,I ordered a medium the top waaayyyy to small it fit like a sport bra (36DDD).,39305,2
39305,The skirt fits great.,39305,2
39306,"The print is really cute, but the material is too slinky and stretchy, sort of like a thin kid's bathing suit material.",39306,2
39306,"It's only ""one size"", and it barely fit me.",39306,2
39306,"I'm 5'7"", 130lb.",39306,2
39306,"If you are young and don't have hips, it might be nice for you.",39306,2
39306,"Because of my hips, it would not stay pulled down, and rode up with every movement.",39306,2
39306,"I wore it a couple of times because I liked the pattern so much, but the dye would rub off on my skin!",39306,2
39306,Had to get rid of it.,39306,2
39307,Fit as expected and exactly pictured design wise but it didn't have the little flare in the pants.,39307,2
39307,They're more of a loose style of leggings.,39307,2
39308,I thought this was great when I first got it a couple of months ago.,39308,2
39308,It has already fallen apart.,39308,2
39308,I have taken care of it per instructions.,39308,2
39308,The plastic inserts are coming out and poke me when I am wearing it.,39308,2
39309,Purchased a size Large for my 4 year old.,39309,2
39309,"She is tall/skinny so I expected these to be too large and that she could grow into them, but they are too tight.",39309,2
39309,Material is rather itchy.,39309,2
39309,No way these would fit an elementary aged child.,39309,2
39309,Shipping took a few weeks.,39309,2
39310,"Is way way too large, I m 5'9, 135 pounds, ordered medium, had to return",39310,2
39311,They are not quite the fit for smaller  nipples.,39311,2
39312,"The swimsuit is a good material, but it is way too small.",39312,2
39312,"Shipping tool way longer than advertised, it said it would be here by April 11, it is now April 23.",39312,2
39313,The rings holding the charm on the chain and holding the clasp on were bent upon arrival.,39313,2
39313,I had to repair the necklace before it could be worn.,39313,2
39314,Didn't receive the right color nor the right size.,39314,2
39315,To short and to fitted for after baby.,39315,2
39315,Didn't gain a lot of weight and almost back to pre pregnancy size and still feel fit  was on the small size,39315,2
39316,"Returned, will not try another.",39316,2
39317,The material feels a little cheap.,39317,2
39317,"I ordered an XL as I have for all other swimsuits on Amazon and they all fit perfectly, but I couldn't even get these bottoms over my thighs.",39317,2
39317,Almost felt like it was a child's XL!,39317,2
39318,It's Asian junior size.,39318,2
39318,So order 2-4 sizes larger than your actual size.,39318,2
39319,Too small but returned and credited very happy with the end result.,39319,2
39320,The fit of this dress is very strange.,39320,2
39320,"It's extremely long (to my knees, not as pictured) and has no curve to it so it's not flattering at all.",39320,2
39321,"The entire area around the middle is enormous, but the top is snug.",39321,2
39321,Definitely can not wear it out of the house.,39321,2
39322,It's not what I expected from the posting online.,39322,2
39322,Material is very sheer.,39322,2
39322,Ypu will need to wear a camisole underneath.,39322,2
39322,Not the greatest quality material.,39322,2
39322,Buttons look good in the picture but also poor quality.,39322,2
39322,Wrinkles easily.,39322,2
39322,Like the print.,39322,2
39322,Not a great purchase.,39322,2
39322,"Large is a little big, but I can wear it, especially since undershirt required.",39322,2
39322,Would not purchase again had I had the benefit of this review prior.,39322,2
39323,Even after reading lots of reviews it didn't fit.,39323,2
39323,"Too short in the torso and padding, which is non removable, did not work for me at all.",39323,2
39323,Will return of I can.,39323,2
39324,the shirt is beautiful but the size was way too big & it doesn't look right on me.,39324,2
39324,I put it back in the package,39324,2
39325,I was disappointed in this cardigan.,39325,2
39325,The colors were off and it had way more of a southwest look then I expected.,39325,2
39325,It was also shorter then it shows as well as ran small.,39325,2
39326,Ordered this a size bigger than the size chart said and it did not fit!!!!,39326,2
39326,Gave to my teenage daughter!!!,39326,2
39326,Disappointed,39326,2
39327,Small did not like fabric,39327,2
39328,Smaller than I thought it would be.,39328,2
39329,"i am a small, 5'6"" 112 lbs it is way to small....it actually fits my granddaughter who is 8 and wears a child size 8",39329,2
39330,The material felt like a Halloween costume.,39330,2
39330,I ended up not needing the dress and I was glad because I would have had to purchase something else.,39330,2
39331,Ok for starters these are nearly clear with almost no hints of green to my disappointment.,39331,2
39331,That's one strike/star.,39331,2
39331,"Secondly the description does not say dangle like some of the other products from this company so I was expecting a huggy type of earring when really it's a dangle, the gem is several mm below the earlobe, and that is exactly what I was trying to avoid.",39331,2
39331,There's the second strike/ star.,39331,2
39331,Third the lever isn't well made I can see these breaking with regular use in less than a month.,39331,2
39331,The lever isn't tight so it goes left to right.,39331,2
39331,Overall you get what you pay for and take a chance with the online shopping experience.,39331,2
39331,Next time I'll go to a local shop and see before I buy.,39331,2
39331,Very disappointed,39331,2
39332,"I wear size XL, but very disappointed this looks size medium.",39332,2
39333,"CHEAP, light, flimsy :(",39333,2
39334,A little smaller than I expected.,39334,2
39335,"Its nice its just that the bigger circle for the necklace hook on the chain broke of instantly so now I have to try to use the regular smaller loops o the chain and the plastic covering for the star, instead of being like a resin it was plastic and you could tell by the rugged edges.",39335,2
39335,Like someone literally cut a plastic ball in half and glued it on the star which is more and likely a piece of paper on the other side.,39335,2
39335,I knew it was cheap but its still not even worth it.,39335,2
39336,not tailored for american women,39336,2
39337,Runs very small XL is comparable to an American M,39337,2
39338,"It is a very lovely shirt and as all the other reviews state, it does run small, but what they don't say is that it also runs short.",39338,2
39338,It barely came to my waist.,39338,2
39338,I typically wear an XS or S and the Medium was not comfortable for me.,39338,2
39338,I had to return it.,39338,2
39339,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who wears a standard large all around.",39339,2
39339,This vest came in and was much too small.,39339,2
39339,I was fine with sending it back for a larger size however just to ship it back to the company costs almost as much as the purchase itself.,39339,2
39339,"At least they DO returns, but it's not worth it, and I'm stuck with an unusable product.",39339,2
39339,"I'd aim to get a size up, and be sure you're getting something that fits.",39339,2
39340,"Cheap price and cheap material, I wasn't very happy with this shirt because it was too small and the sewing was coming out when I recieved it.",39340,2
39341,"Offside, larger than actual 18g.",39341,2
39341,Still cute just wish I could wear it :(,39341,2
39342,The crotch portion ripped into a huge hole after wearing it only 2 times!,39342,2
39342,"I ordered the medium and I am 5'7"" 124 lbs",39342,2
39343,"Although very cute, these are not very durable.",39343,2
39343,We bought these for our four year old who loves ties.,39343,2
39343,Unfortunately they barely lasted a month before three of the four broke.,39343,2
39343,"Two of them the stitching on the back came undone, and the other ones elastic broke.",39343,2
39344,way too small,39344,2
39345,Way too small and the material is very cheap.,39345,2
39346,Probably won't wear it as the material is way too thin,39346,2
39347,Not what I was expecting.,39347,2
39347,I don't care for the feel of the material or the way it looks on me.,39347,2
39348,Material is very thin .,39348,2
39349,Bought an XL which says US 12 on the label.,39349,2
39349,"This is not a US 12, it's about a 10.",39349,2
39349,The length is also not 30 inches it is 27 inches which make this skirt decidedly not maxi.,39349,2
39349,It's pretty but the descriptions are way off.,39349,2
39350,Cheap material.,39350,2
39351,Too small,39351,2
39352,Shirt fabric is very thin and sizing is very small,39352,2
39353,Oh dear god this dress feels horrible.,39353,2
39353,It was slightly too small and the lines created illusion of linebacker shoulders and minimized my hips.,39353,2
39353,My inner arms still feel horrible from brushing against the sides.,39353,2
39354,this was returned because it was way too small.,39354,2
39355,Too small,39355,2
39356,It was to small even though I ordered a plus size.,39356,2
39356,They did refund my money right away!,39356,2
39357,The photo did not represent item accurately .,39357,2
39357,It is much smaller and less full,39357,2
39358,I really do like the suit.,39358,2
39358,"The bottoms fit perfectly, they are cheeky bottoms though so if you don't like that then don't buy this suit.",39358,2
39358,"However, the top looks different than the picture... As in there's basically nothing to it.",39358,2
39358,It barely cover my nipple...,39358,2
39358,There's just no material.,39358,2
39358,Also it was almost impossible to tighten it from the back because of the way it cross crosses it only tightens so much.,39358,2
39358,"It was very see through, and you could see the pads and it looked so awkward...",39358,2
39358,So I had to remove them.,39358,2
39359,FAKE!,39359,2
39359,Stinks and glue coming apart in card inserts.,39359,2
39360,"The material split after the first wash (I hadn't even worn it, just washing it to shrink it down a bit), as shown in my photo.",39360,2
39360,I guess this is what you get for $8 bucks.,39360,2
39361,The spring bars seem fine.,39361,2
39361,The box is really terrible.,39361,2
39361,"The box has zero closure mechanism, so it comes taped together.",39361,2
39361,"When you remove the tape, the entire outer edge is covered in sticky residue.",39361,2
39361,"The lid of the box has zero closure, no click into place, no pressure closure nothing.",39361,2
39361,"So, here is a sticky box full of tiny objects whose top does not close.",39361,2
39361,It sticks to your fingers and jars the spring bars.,39361,2
39361,If you want to wipe the edges clean with something watch out if you jostle the box the lid gets ajar and the bars jump into the wrong slots.,39361,2
39361,"the last straw was my forgetting how badly made it is and my trying to put the box into my coat pocket, the lid came off immediately and the bars spilled across their trays and into my pocket.",39361,2
39361,A new product should not require gunk removal upon arrival.,39361,2
39361,And any kind of functional box like this should have some kind of closure mechanism.,39361,2
39362,Super cute for my 8 year old...too bad I bought it for me instead.,39362,2
39362,"It fits her perfect, but I ordered a 3x!!",39362,2
39362,"2 stars for cute, but honestly wouldn't have gotten it if I knew.",39362,2
39363,Fits great!,39363,2
39363,"But the foam was coming off, the plastic was melded together, and the paint is really s***ty.",39363,2
39364,I fell in love with this shirt when I saw on here.,39364,2
39364,I was so excited when it came.,39364,2
39364,I examined the shirt and it is NOT a good quality shirt the seems are crooked and the alien is porley sown on.,39364,2
39364,Also this is a crop top.,39364,2
39364,4/10,39364,2
39365,Small on bottom.,39365,2
39365,Okay on the top.,39365,2
39366,These did not fit like the picture shown...they hug my ankles.,39366,2
39366,I do like the fabric.,39366,2
39367,This dress does not look like the picture.,39367,2
39367,The material on top is rather sheer and the skirt instead of being navy is more of a royal blue.,39367,2
39367,It does fit me though.,39367,2
39367,I am 5'3 and 110 pounds and got a size small.,39367,2
39367,"I will probably wear it since it is not terrible looking, but it is definitely not as pictured, so be warned.",39367,2
39368,Thin material and not as forgiving as it should be for a maternity dress.,39368,2
39369,"It's a nice shirt, good quality, but I order a medium size (10), It does have the M sticker.",39369,2
39369,...but it fits like a large size (14)...,39369,2
39370,It did not meet my expectations .,39370,2
39370,It was damaged .,39370,2
39371,"Fast delivery but poor quality, the fringe wasn't all the same size as in some pieces had to be cut to look like the rest..",39371,2
39371,Very cheap looking but you get what you pay for.,39371,2
39371,"Also the color was a nice red, it looked more dull than the picture so over all really wasn't worth buying.",39371,2
39372,"too small,,,maybe my grand baby has a large head?",39372,2
39373,It's cute.. but it runs small and short.,39373,2
39373,"It fit me like a shirt, that's how short it was.",39373,2
39373,Order a size up I guess.,39373,2
39374,Shirt doesn't look like the one in the picture does.,39374,2
39374,The one in the pic looks to be a blueish gray with faded lines that blend into the other colors.,39374,2
39374,Can't even see the white lines in the picture.,39374,2
39374,"By the way, there are white lines on the shirt.",39374,2
39374,I went ahead and kept it but should have returned it.,39374,2
39374,"I seriously doubt, whether it was Amazon or Columbia, that the camera used to take the picture was so cheap that it came out looking the way it did.",39374,2
39374,"So, I wonder if a little photoshopping was involved.",39374,2
39374,I don't know.,39374,2
39374,You tell me.,39374,2
39375,Very very large.,39375,2
39375,I bought the size 16 as I normally wear a 14-16.,39375,2
39375,This was huge.,39375,2
39375,For reference my waist is 38 and hip 42.,39375,2
39375,And the next size down that was available was a 10.,39375,2
39375,"I had to purchase a different brand, which was true to size.",39375,2
39376,"Because of the way it was wrapped, the number was smudgy.",39376,2
39376,The size runs smaller.,39376,2
39377,Not as expected,39377,2
39378,Super cute.,39378,2
39378,but it runs too small.,39378,2
39378,I am a xs/s and i think i should have gotten a m/l,39378,2
39379,the fur is itchy and too tight,39379,2
39380,"it came with zipper spoiled  I caand dirty  brown spots on it I guess someone wore it and returned it to you guys, but because it was so cheap I'm just gonna fix the zippe.the look is exactly as displayed",39380,2
39381,cheaply made,39381,2
39382,"One of them is fused/stuck, and cannot be used, so it's unfortunate... only one useable in the pair.",39382,2
39383,"those tight fit jacket size, not outer coat!!",39383,2
39383,so be careful to pick your size... measure twice.. or three times and purchase the item.,39383,2
39383,"otherwise, like me, you have to buy, return, buy, return....over and over again.",39383,2
39383,"the product seems nice with this price but if it does not fit, that is the point?",39383,2
39384,It is much much smaller than I expected.,39384,2
39384,Can't even make out the images on the darn thing.,39384,2
39384,The colors are nice though.,39384,2
39385,I am a size 6  I ordered an XL due to reviews reporting that the sizes ran small.,39385,2
39385,But that is an understatement!!,39385,2
39385,Unless you are under 100 lbs these will not fit well.,39385,2
39385,"I am 5'10' 130 lbs, an extra large was to small and also way too short.",39385,2
39386,Last season this hat was amazing in the cold blowing winds of Chicago.,39386,2
39386,This season I took it out of storage and it was shedding worse than a German Shepherd.,39386,2
39386,"It was stored on a shelf in a coat closet, so it wasn't subjected to any harsh environment.",39386,2
39387,This is a lovely jacket...but the sizing is incredibly small.,39387,2
39387,"Based on the reviews that the sizes run small, I ordered an XXL and it fit like a MEDIUM jacket (with some room to layer).",39387,2
39387,"So please be aware that if your normal size is a women's small or medium, you can probably order this jacket if you go about two or three sizes up.",39387,2
39387,Everyone else needs to look elsewhere.,39387,2
39387,I can't imagine that the XXL in this jacket would fit any man who wears larger than a small in men's jackets.,39387,2
39388,I am 5'10 wear a size 10/12 - it was really short in the sleeves and  barely covered my rear.,39388,2
39388,also a bit snug in the bust.,39388,2
39389,I was really excited to get this to have some alone time with my husband.,39389,2
39389,I wear a size 10 and I ordered the XL and it is still way to small!,39389,2
39389,I would recommend unless you are a tooth pick finding something like this somewhere else that is actually true to size.,39389,2
39389,I should have known though since it does come from China and clothes from there always seem to run small.,39389,2
39389,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.,39389,2
39390,The fabric between the V is pretty see-through.,39390,2
39390,"I bought this shirt as an easy, comfortable go-to for work, but my cleavage is way too visible to make it appropriate work attire (I am on the busty side, it might be completely fine for less-endowed ladies).",39390,2
39391,It is not 2 packs of 12.,39391,2
39391,I was looking to buy a cheaper hat for each of the children attending my nieces party.,39391,2
39391,"This was very misleading, and I would have never spent $6 each on these hats.",39391,2
39392,"There is a, not a scratch, I'm not sure how to describe it, on the lens I took a picture but, it doesn't look how it should.",39392,2
39392,"I'll try to explain, in the picture attached with my review is a ""blur"" that blur is what is on my lens, I held it up to light so it would reveal itself in my photo.",39392,2
39392,It is not a bad picture that line on the photo is on my glasses.,39392,2
39392,I don't exactly see the line when I wear the glasses but I'm not happy about it.,39392,2
39392,"It's permanent, by the way, it won't come off.",39392,2
39392,I tried.,39392,2
39393,It may have been my fault in ordering the wrong size.,39393,2
39393,The conversion of sizes from China to US is quite different.,39393,2
39393,"I thought I had ordered according to my measurements, however the size was at least three sizes too small.",39393,2
39393,Will order again in a much larger size to determine if in fact that was the case.,39393,2
39394,Liked the design and fabric but size was horable.,39394,2
39394,Since description said it runs small I ordered 2 sizes up.,39394,2
39394,It turned out like 2 sizes smaller.,39394,2
39394,Waste of money.,39394,2
39395,"Looks cheap, but it was cheap sooo, it is what it is.",39395,2
39396,Eh... Print looks good and the fit was okay.,39396,2
39396,"Unfortunately, I returned because it is not lined AT ALL so you can see through and does not offer any kind of chest support.",39396,2
39397,poor quality,39397,2
39398,The dress is adorable but the fit was wierd and the beads were very loose and some fell off.,39398,2
39398,As for fit I ordered a 10 for my daughter which would normally be her size if not a bit large.,39398,2
39398,The breast and front area were very roomy.,39398,2
39398,But when it came to clasping it in the back it hardly came together.,39398,2
39398,I got it clasped but it was way too tight.,39398,2
39398,The waist was pretty roomy.,39398,2
39398,So this is why I say wierd fit.,39398,2
39398,I don't know if I'd recommend although the style was great!,39398,2
39399,Not happy with this bracelet.,39399,2
39399,"Way big for my wrist, gave to a friend.",39399,2
39400,"Very cute , but Manny beads fell off and were lying in the bottom of the package when I opened it.",39400,2
39401,Cute in picture but fits really weird...,39401,2
39401,Very loose in back & kinda pulls... No real shape or form to it.,39401,2
39401,I'm 140lbs 5'7,39401,2
39402,Mask doesn't cover very far down the neck and might be problematic when trying to keep it tucked inside a coat.,39402,2
39402,Wouldn't keep the neck warm outside the coat.,39402,2
39402,Elastic and toggles hang out on both sides when tightened.,39402,2
39402,Not a great design.,39402,2
39402,"Ok for $7, I guess.",39402,2
39403,Smaller than I thought it would be,39403,2
39404,"The fascinator arrived slightly damaged, with 2 of the feathers broken off of the netting.",39404,2
39404,"The hot-glue handiwork is quite visible, which makes it appear to be a cheap homemade craft project gone wrong.",39404,2
39405,I wish it look like the pic.,39405,2
39405,"U have to pull it way up higher than your ankles, and still have difficulty having the top cover properly.",39405,2
39405,The material is thin.,39405,2
39405,Wouldn't wear it outside.,39405,2
39406,Not flattering at all.,39406,2
39406,My two piece bathing suits looks better.,39406,2
39406,It made my hips look fatter and larger.,39406,2
39406,Sent back.,39406,2
39407,I look like super girl,39407,2
39408,"I have wide feet, but these were too big and gappy in the toe area on top.",39408,2
39409,Something sbout this shirt just seemed off.,39409,2
39409,It looks like a smedium.,39409,2
39409,The width is goos but fits my nephew like a crop top and there was a printing error on the shirt.,39409,2
39409,It had a big blue blob on thw front.,39409,2
39409,Well use it as a house shirt i guess and let him walk around like winnie the pooh,39409,2
39410,"Not at all what I expected, huge size, cheap quality, and horrible priced return shipping.",39410,2
39411,This robe is huge.,39411,2
39411,"If you are a size 2, 4, 6 and possibly an 8, do not bother to order this robe.",39411,2
39411,The size small fits like a very big medium to a large.,39411,2
39411,The terry was not very thick.,39411,2
39411,It definitely did not meet my expectation.,39411,2
39411,"If you compare this robe material to a towel, I would say it is on the cheaper, less plush side.",39411,2
39411,I am surprised at the favorable reviews.,39411,2
39412,I like the purse but just wish that this inside was cloth instead of a cheap plastic,39412,2
39413,"Purchased two for my boys, one Large and one Medium.",39413,2
39413,My kids have big heads and these hats fit well.,39413,2
39413,First time we wore them was near pool water so I rinsed them with fresh water and hung to dry.,39413,2
39413,They are no very soft anymore and super wrinkly now.,39413,2
39413,Might be better if I threw in dryer but I do not want them to shrink.,39413,2
39414,Definitely not what it looks like.,39414,2
39414,"Thick embroidery on sleeves and hem, ""tassels"" or fringe on bottom hem is cheap fake suede strips.",39414,2
39414,"Not even half the amount of fabric in the photo, it's like a column dress, not flowy at all.",39414,2
39414,"Only reason for two stars is the construction, but i doubt I'll wear it enough to test that.",39414,2
39415,Big in waist-tight in thighs.,39415,2
39415,The color looked like they were very old.,39415,2
39415,Kinda short.,39415,2
39415,I returned these.,39415,2
39416,"Did not fit my ears, and were not warm, fell off easy.",39416,2
39416,Would not buy again.,39416,2
39416,They need thicker material and ear mitts that cover smaller ears or smaller sizes,39416,2
39417,Coat was listed as runs small so instead of getting a Large I ordered a 2XXL.,39417,2
39417,I can barely get it zipped.,39417,2
39417,It is tight in the hips and shoulders.,39417,2
39417,I didn't send back since I am planning on losing weight to wear it next winter since it didn't get cold enough this winter to wear it.,39417,2
39417,It needs to be resized at the factory to be more accurate since it runs 2 sizes too small.,39417,2
39418,"Didn't fit like a small, more like an XS.",39418,2
39419,"It is definitely different, if not a little awkward fitting.",39419,2
39419,The straps seem a bit binding.,39419,2
39419,Ordered larger size but it was still almost too small.,39419,2
39420,Comes off too easy but like the design,39420,2
39421,Change colors within 3 weeks,39421,2
39422,"fell apart when I used it for the first time, but very beautiful",39422,2
39423,"They seemed great at first, for the first part of the day.",39423,2
39423,By the end of the day the material was worn away where it touched my boot.,39423,2
39423,Only got one wear out of it.,39423,2
39424,They break a little too easily...,39424,2
39425,"When I think of chain, it think of looped metal.",39425,2
39425,"These are not looped, they are thick,continuous and coiled.",39425,2
39425,"So the ""snake""  part is accurate, but these are not chains.",39425,2
39425,They might look okay with a cheap pendant.,39425,2
39426,I just didn't like it in person.,39426,2
39426,"Looked cheesy, not cute at all once on.",39426,2
39426,"Some might like it, I just didn't.",39426,2
39427,"I like short dresses, that's fine.. but the blouse/dress I received does not look like the one in the picture!",39427,2
39427,"There is NO way I could wear it as a dress, doesn't even cover my crotch.",39427,2
39427,"I'm 5'4, not some kind of giant.",39427,2
39427,I do not have a long torso.,39427,2
39428,The seller will take care of you if you are not satisfied - that part is good.,39428,2
39428,But the product itself does not deserve 5 starts.,39428,2
39428,"I got a beige one, but the color is quite unattractive unlike the picture.",39428,2
39428,"It is a lot darker and has ripple patterns(if you magnify, you might be able to see).",39428,2
39428,The zippers are very wide and jagged.,39428,2
39428,You need to maneuver the zipper back and forth to open/close them.,39428,2
39428,This will be inconvenient if you need something inside quickly.,39428,2
39428,The size and the pockets seem to be adequate for a travel tote.,39428,2
39429,"I like oversized- I'm a petite small- bought a large, still small- gave away.",39429,2
39430,This is not a 3x this dress is cut way too small.,39430,2
39430,sizing isn't correct.,39430,2
39430,:-(,39430,2
39431,looked like something for Halloween.,39431,2
39432,This was a Christmas gift and the wife loved the grey color but if you are not a thin model you may not want this dress....,39432,2
39432,It showed every lump and bump that wasn't supposed to show.,39432,2

39435,Super mailable.,39435,2
39435,Very very easily bended.,39435,2

39437,"Same size for this one, and considerably smaller.",39437,2
39437,Should have tried on before I washed it and now can't return.,39437,2
39437,Sizes VERY inconsistent.,39437,2
39438,I didn't expect high quality but this belongs in a gumball.,39438,2
39438,"Stray blobs of glue, plastic bits (I won't call them ""stones"") glued in offcenter, etc.",39438,2
39438,I took a chance; learned my lesson.,39438,2
39438,I'm highly suspicious of the other reviews; can't imagine anyone would think this is something of quality.,39438,2
39439,Fit great.,39439,2
39439,Problem is that  the buttons are flimsy plastic and slip through the lace easily.,39439,2
39439,the gloves ripped within an hour of wearing them.,39439,2
39439,Very disappointing.,39439,2

39442,Not very flattering at all.,39442,2
39442,Would not recommend.,39442,2
39443,I bought this for a trip to Brazil.,39443,2
39443,I thought this would be perfect but it fell short of my expectations.,39443,2
39443,"First, there is no padding and secondly,  it fit ackwardly on my body.",39443,2
39443,I plan on eventually taking it to a tailor.,39443,2
39444,"Good quality, durable.",39444,2
39444,But honestly way overpriced for what it is.,39444,2
39444,It's about twice what it should cost but nobody seems to carry them anymore,39444,2
39445,I usually like leveret clothing but this item did disappoint the top is cheaply mad.,39445,2
39445,The material is too thin and the opposite design on the inside of the shirt is scratchy..,39445,2
39446,"Overall, jacket is lightweight and warm.",39446,2
39446,The hood is a little small and doesn't cover the entire head.,39446,2
39446,The zipper to the hood constantly unzips from the jacket.,39446,2
39446,The liner to the inside pocket ripped almost instantly and the seem under the right arm ripped about 4 inches down the side of the jacket...The stuffing is coming out.,39446,2
39446,I've only had the jacket for two months.,39446,2
39447,It's not worth the price.,39447,2
39447,It looks very childish.,39447,2
39447,Something you would get from a quarter machine.,39447,2
39448,The body portion of this costume is great.,39448,2
39448,It was much better than I expected.,39448,2
39448,"However, the mask cannot be used.",39448,2
39448,"It was misshapen when it arrived and after many attempts to make it work, we will have to buy a different mask.",39448,2
39448,"I don't know anything about this character, the costume was for my son who refuses to return it, so I can't speak to the authenticity, but truly, the mask is not wearable.",39448,2
39448,We have already picked out a different mask to use with the costume.,39448,2
39449,The sizes are not what they say they are.,39449,2
39449,L looks li a M. But it is a beautiful bathing suit,39449,2
39450,Extremely thin material and poor finishing.,39450,2
39450,Looks nothing like it does in the picture.,39450,2
39451,Doesn't stay put,39451,2
39452,I got my 11 month old a size 2 to make sure it would not be too tight.,39452,2

39454,I hope the same doesn't happen to this one.,39454,2
39455,Good quality.,39455,2
39455,The fit  was too small,39455,2
39456,These pants are pretty cheap feeling.,39456,2
39456,The elastic band is narrow and not sewed down either (so it can twist around).,39456,2
39456,"They are also majourly small, so order several sizes up (I ordered a full-size up!).",39456,2
39456,Returning.,39456,2
39457,The fabric is completely see through and as its backless not sure how you would wear a slip under it.,39457,2
39457,If I could be bothered I'll be lining the whole dress.,39457,2
39458,Way too small.,39458,2
39459,"I was so excited to get these, but was very disappointed with how comfortable they were.",39459,2

39463,"Hard to button, material extremely light.",39463,2
39463,Cute idea.,39463,2
39464,The jewelry DOES NOT fit in the needles!!!,39464,2
39464,I'm very disappointed that I went thru the pain of the piercing and I couldn't even put the jewelry in the proper way because it does not fit In the needles.,39464,2
39465,Very cute swimsuit.,39465,2
39465,For a woman with a large butt this suit covered very well.,39465,2
39465,The material was really think and I actually ended up not getting in the water because of it.,39465,2
39465,If it had a liner it wouldve been better.,39465,2
39465,The top was a long piece of fabric that provided a few different options for tying.,39465,2
39465,It kept rolling up so on the beach or matched it with a bandu top.,39465,2
39465,You may also want to hem your suit as it is just fabric.,39465,2
39466,Pretty small beanie.,39466,2
39466,Love the design though.,39466,2
39467,One tiny stone was missing..don't you have a QC that checks the product before it's packaged?,39467,2
39468,It seems kinda funny that certain pair of snoozies arrived with another pair of snoozies that were a size medium and the other ones were a size small!,39468,2
39468,!,39468,2
39469,Too clingy for my taste,39469,2
39470,I spent a lot  of money on this necklace a lot more than more of the others I've gotten on here for 10$ or cheaper and all the rest are still going strong w no signs of breaking.,39470,2
39470,I spent much more on this one and it didn't not last a month.,39470,2
39470,The whole thing fell apart.,39470,2
39470,NO NOT BUY.,39470,2
39470,WHEN I CONTACTED THEM ABOUT THE ISSUE NEVER EVEN GOT A RESPONSE.,39470,2
39470,SOME OF THESE SO CALLED SELLERS SHOULD REMEMBER WHO KEEPS THEM IN BUSINESS.,39470,2
39470,THE CUSTOMERS.,39470,2

39470,!!!!,39470,2

39471,Sized way to small a xl fit like a medium,39471,2
39472,"I always wear medium, but this is way too small.",39472,2
39473,These things are very inconsistent in quality and size.,39473,2
39473,"I've had 7 of these and one was great and solid, the rest were cheaper versions, and two wear (for some reason smaller that the rest that barely fit the wrist).",39473,2
39473,You got to watch out for the buttons because some can come of pretty easy (I guess they don't snap in well).,39473,2
39473,The sad part is the pebbles/beads turn brown fast.,39473,2
39473,"So if you get one well made with good leather, your lucky (I had one out of 7).",39473,2
39473,But be aware that you'll most likely get a crappy one.,39473,2
39473,"They say its hand made, so that explains the inconsistency with these.",39473,2
39474,I found that the Belly Bandit was too stiff to be able to sit down while wearing.,39474,2
39474,I breast feed my little one and couldn't keep it on while feeding.,39474,2
39474,It's too much work taking it on and off with the frequency of sitting.,39474,2
39474,It does provide support when standing but couldn't make it work for me.,39474,2
39474,The return policy isn't great.,39474,2
39474,"I bought it ahead of time and by the time I got to try it, I was unable to return it.",39474,2
39474,I wouldn't recommend this product.,39474,2

39479,Wayy too small.,39479,2
39479,Couldn't even button it,39479,2
39480,"The blouse itself was fine, but because the way it was cut it does not cut off my shoulders and it does seem like its a Asian style cut.",39480,2
39480,I'm a 38 DD and more broad shoulder.,39480,2
39480,So if you are built like an Asian it will fit you.,39480,2
39480,I believe I saw the same shirt on ebay and it came from China.,39480,2
39480,So the instructions tell me to actually watch because it's built for Asian sizes.,39480,2
39481,The jeans were more like jeggings than jeans.,39481,2
39481,I ordered an extra large and it was still too small.,39481,2
39481,I didn't really like them it doesn't look like anything in the picture.,39481,2
39481,I think it's better to buy jeans in store than online.,39481,2
39482,Fit EXTRA loose,39482,2
39483,Pricey color is off and shrunk after one wash,39483,2
39484,"bubbles on top layer even before wearing,",39484,2

39485,Also runs smaller than expected but was very cute.,39485,2
39486,OK scarf.,39486,2
39486,"Very thin, the red/burgundy not as bright as photo.",39486,2
39486,Won't send back but won't order again.,39486,2
39486,It looks a lot longer in photo....I am wondering if they used two scarves for the photo or the dummy is a child's measurement!!!,39486,2

39487,"Bought this top in Gray Size 4 - I am 5'8"" 140lbs - returned because even for a loose fitted shirt it was too baggy and not long enough to compensate for that fact",39487,2
39488,It is not the dress posted in the picture.,39488,2
39488,"It fits as suppose to, but cheap quality and cheaply made",39488,2
39489,The shorts are not a Jean material as expected.,39489,2
39489,The shirt is cute and so far has held up.,39489,2
39489,Shorts were too small.,39489,2
39490,The material was a lot thinner than I had expected.,39490,2
39491,"Description does not indicate that this has padded, push up cups.",39491,2
39491,"Also, the fabric bunched up in my mid section and made me look fluffy.",39491,2
39491,It didn't fit my body and I sent it back.,39491,2
39492,"Did not fit as expected, sizing did not match size chart.",39492,2
39492,The material is lovely and good quality.,39492,2
39493,Nice coat but not true adult sizes.,39493,2
39493,More like how you would size girls.,39493,2
39493,M is about a girls 10 or 12.,39493,2
39493,XXL is about girls 18.,39493,2
39494,"Very pretty, but runs smaller than expected.",39494,2
39494,"I ordered a medium -  I'm 5'1"" and wear a size 6 dress, this slip is very, very short compared to the picture.",39494,2
39494,I'm a C cup bra and it was stretched to the point of almost ripping.,39494,2
39495,Way too big and loose.,39495,2
39495,The stocking clips are also way too long and did not hold them up at all.,39495,2
39496,This looks more like something my grandpa would wear than what it looks like in the picture...,39496,2
39496,The material is kinda scratchy on the outside,39496,2
39497,This hat is huge!!!,39497,2
39497,And as a cancer patient with out any hair of my own this hat practically falls over my eyes.,39497,2
39497,Very disappointed because the pictures make this hat look so cute for a cool fall day,39497,2
39498,Smaller than I thought.,39498,2
39498,I'm going to keep it only because I was planning on using for layering only.,39498,2
39498,If you want to wear buttoned up I would go with at least 1-2 sizes larger,39498,2
39499,"These socks are not the greatest, unfortunately.",39499,2
39499,"They tend to run small and after awhile, slide down around the ankles.",39499,2
39499,They also tend to get lots of little bumps and loose threads.,39499,2
39500,"It's really big I ordered a large because I have somewhat big butt , I'm curvy and the bottoms is extremely big the too fits perfect and I have small boobs.",39500,2
39500,Btw I'm 5'5 at 150lba,39500,2

39502,"Sadly, I am returning.",39502,2
39503,Ordered XL and im 6'2 215 pounds.,39503,2
39503,It was a good 3 inches to small in length and very very tight,39503,2
39504,"The color of the wine purse on my computer was an obvious purple, but when I received it, it was a disgusting red color.",39504,2
39504,"Needed more card holder pockets, only had four.",39504,2
39504,I returned it right away as the color was so bad and not what I thought it was advertised as.,39504,2
39505,Poor quality nice colors,39505,2
39506,It was very shiny and pretty but the clasp did not close from the second wear on.,39506,2
39506,Waste of money in the end  Also the hoop is huge and took up most of my face.,39506,2
39507,cheaply made but looked ok on,39507,2
39508,Cute purse but it came without the long strap which is the only reason I bought it.,39508,2
39508,Also has a funky smell in the inside.,39508,2
39509,"The product arrived ahead of schedule, they look nice and seem pretty well made.",39509,2
39509,"The rings are really, really tiny.",39509,2
39509,They didn't even fit on my daughter's small fingers.,39509,2
39510,One of the plastic knobs broke on the second watch.,39510,2
39511,I read it was a unisex hat.,39511,2
39511,This is clearly a girls hat in Navy blue.,39511,2
39511,Even the image on the tag is a little girl.,39511,2
39511,I like the hat.,39511,2
39511,"Cute on a girl, well constructed.",39511,2
39511,"It's a good product, but it's not for a boy.",39511,2
39511,That's why I have such few stars.,39511,2
39512,Fabric feels good but it runs on the very very small size .,39512,2
39512,Really wished it would of fit right !,39512,2
39512,I would need more like a large for it to fit like a medium,39512,2
39513,The product itself is of good quality.,39513,2
39513,"In some ways, it is much better than my issue M65 Field Jacket.",39513,2
39513,The sizing is what ruins it.,39513,2
39513,"When I say too large, I'm literally drowning in it.",39513,2
39513,"There were so many reviews on this product, and so much misleading information.",39513,2
39513,It becomes even more confusing if you are on the borderline of two different sizes.,39513,2
39513,"When I enlisted in the Air Force, I was 5'7, 147lbs.",39513,2
39513,"I wore a medium-regular, and it fit perfectly.",39513,2
39513,"Fast forward to today, I'm 5'7, 185lbs.",39513,2
39513,I ordered a medium from Amazon.,39513,2
39513,The tag reads medium-regular.,39513,2
39513,It is way TOO BIG.,39513,2
39513,"Right now, I'm on the verge of a medium or large with T-Shirts and Jackets.",39513,2
39513,It just depends on the maker.,39513,2
39513,"With Columbia, Nautica, Nike & Oakley I wear Medium.",39513,2
39513,"With Gildan T-Shirts, I wear a Large.",39513,2
39514,Am returning this item.,39514,2
39515,"this was tough, as there is no size chart and everyone is a bit different, but i ordered this with the hope of finding a comfortable sports bra at an inexpensive price to wear just once a week.",39515,2
39515,I have a full 36G (UK size) bust and definitely did not expect quality but for my needs i didn't want to spend the $ on an expensive bra.,39515,2
39515,"What is strange, is that the cups were WAY too small, but the back straps were very long.",39515,2
39515,"in order to make the bra hold up in the front, i had to pull the back way down my lower back which looked weird (or maybe sew up the straps?).",39515,2
39515,i ordered the 2XL which probably would have fit someone with a larger frame (38-40 band size or broad shoulders/ thicker body) and smaller chest (my guess is B or C cup actually).,39515,2
39515,the band was firm fitting but had a little too much room in it for me.,39515,2
39515,i suggest putting it on over your head and ignoring the zipper unless you have someone help you zip it up.,39515,2
39515,if I jumped up and down in this or ran in place it would not hold up my chest.,39515,2
39515,"if you are looking for a comfortable stay at home bra for the weekend, i think this does the trick.",39515,2
39515,"it is very soft and comfortable to wear, and i was surprised by the quality for the price.",39515,2
39515,the way the fabric comes around the edge of the zipper at the top and bottom is a nice detail and not overlooked.,39515,2
39516,No do not feel like leather,39516,2
39517,Fitted much smaller than expected.,39517,2
39517,Not at all what the picture seems.,39517,2
39517,It was tight and hard to walk around in.,39517,2
39517,I was not at all happy with this product.,39517,2
39518,"I should've just followed the size chart and ordered my pre-pregnancy size because a M (when I'm 5'2"", 135 lbs, 36DD and 28 weeks along) was too big everywhere.",39518,2
39518,What I disliked was there was no bust support whatsoever.,39518,2
39518,The elastic just hung straight down instead of fitting under my breasts and keeping them separated from or off my belly.,39518,2
39518,"Also, it hung past my knees.",39518,2
39518,"In this nightgown, my body looked like a grandma's, not a 30-year-old's.",39518,2
39518,"Patterns are cute, though!",39518,2
39519,Broke when I tried it on,39519,2
39520,Too small,39520,2
39521,"I thought they were going to be the ones shown on the image, but they werent.",39521,2
39522,shrank,39522,2
39523,Very cheaply made.,39523,2
39523,The little snaps came off right out of the package.,39523,2
39523,Material poorly sewn.,39523,2
39523,"Such a cute concept, but I was very disappointed and don't plan on ever wearing this.",39523,2
39524,Very cute but collects everything and never let's go.,39524,2
39525,It was NOT anything like the image depicted in the photo.,39525,2
39525,"Very misleading, cheap material.",39525,2
39526,I'm gonna try to do something with the fabric.,39526,2
39527,I wear a size Xl in every shirt I own.,39527,2
39527,This is the only time I can say it is way too big.,39527,2
39527,"I like my shirts to be loose fitting, but this is extreme.",39527,2
39528,Too small,39528,2
39529,"The percentage was a  54% when it should be a 24% ,this item runs extra EXTRA small.",39529,2
39530,"Very LIMITED space,can't use it.",39530,2
39531,Took FOREVER to get my package.,39531,2
39531,And the quality is a bit cheep.,39531,2
39531,Their made for one time use only.,39531,2
39531,Once you've worn them once the adhesive is not sticky any more,39531,2
39532,It was not as full as it looks and doesn't go that far down on the neck.,39532,2
39532,It got the job done for Halloween.,39532,2
39532,"Also, buy a wig cap if you have a lot of hair.",39532,2
39533,The hat looks good but it's not as good as it looks.,39533,2
39533,It stretches out of shape very quickly.,39533,2
39534,"Love the necklace,  but the hole you have to attach it to is so tiny and hard to grasp together, otherwise its a delight.",39534,2
39535,Fur is not the best quality and it is huge.,39535,2
39535,I think it was at least two sizes bigger then I expected.,39535,2
39536,This fit way too small!,39536,2
39536,I'm 5'1'' and the medium was too short!,39536,2
39536,It fit more like a top than a dress.,39536,2
39536,I'm also top heavy so it fit tight across the chest.,39536,2
39536,The material was very soft and the color is a little brighter than the picture.,39536,2
39536,-C,39536,2
39537,This could be better.,39537,2
39537,"It's cheap and good for the price, the reason why I'm giving it a low rating is because I never received the ring for it.",39537,2
39538,Cute but did not stay on!,39538,2
39538,The ones that fold over around the ankles from Walmart for a fraction of the price did much better.,39538,2
39539,I was told I was getting a certain style of dress and received a completely different one that looks way cheaper than what I paid for.. Other costumers received a lovely dress while I got something different.,39539,2
39539,Some beads had fallen and seller communication wasn't the best.,39539,2
39539,Dress looks decent at night but in person it looks cheap..I even told the seller I wanted what I was being told I was buying but they never wanted to check and I got what I specifically told them I didn't want..,39539,2
39540,Not my favorite.,39540,2
39540,It's a rather heavy material and I was expecting something a bit lighter weight for hot weather.,39540,2
39540,This looks to me like something you could wear as a nursing uniform top.,39540,2
39541,They were kinda sheer.,39541,2
39541,Umm no,39541,2
39542,It was soaking wet when it arrived.,39542,2
39542,I smelled as if it had been dropped in a sewer.,39542,2
39542,It is outside.,39542,2
39542,Hoping the smell will leave.,39542,2
39542,Probably not though.,39542,2
39542,I really like the way it looks but can not use it at this point.,39542,2
39543,I purchased this for my 2 year old grandson.,39543,2
39543,"The shirt is too small and the pants are big and baggy which is good because of the style, but he cannot pull the shirt over his head.",39543,2
39543,"Also, one of the black stirrups that hangs on the leg was detached.",39543,2
39543,It was not sewn properly in the seam of the pants.,39543,2
39543,I had to sew it in myself.,39543,2
39544,"Ran small and if i dry it, its no longer going to fit me.",39544,2
39545,This product is for women who have a short torso.,39545,2
39545,Anyone who is tall will not be able to fit in this romper.,39545,2
39545,Love the colors but was very sad that it was too tight on the torso.,39545,2
39546,The bathing suit runs small from top to bottom but fits well everywhere else.,39546,2
39546,I had to return it though because it was too uncomfortable.,39546,2
39546,The Sweetheart neck line is very pretty though.,39546,2
39547,"I purchased this Cactus Bay shirt and one other, both in XXL, for Halloween last year.",39547,2
39547,The sizing was totally different.,39547,2
39547,"One shirt was 6"" wider and 3 "" longer than the other one, and neither one fit correctly.",39547,2
39547,I have tried to find someone at Cactus Bay Apparel to email about this but there is nothing on their website.,39547,2
39547,"I love the look of many of their shirts, with the design covering the back and front, but I can't waste more money on these when I can't count on the sizing.",39547,2
39548,Was larger than expected.,39548,2
39548,"I bought a medium, and material does not appear to be able to be altered without damaging dress.",39548,2
39549,Ordered a large  based on size measurement.,39549,2
39549,Chart measurement is definitely misleading.,39549,2
39549,Fitted  liked  an xxxl.,39549,2
39549,"Very, very disappointed, and does not recommend.",39549,2
39550,I love the dress but it doesn't fit perfectly.,39550,2
39550,I'm petite so the shoulder part is kind of loose.,39550,2
39550,This is the first time I purchased my clothes online so it's a learning experience.,39550,2
39551,It fits strangely.,39551,2
39551,Not very form fitting and looked very cheap.,39551,2
39551,It also had a hole on one of the sleeves.,39551,2
39551,I was going to use this dress for a Halloween costume but I ended up returning it because it just looked too cheap and weird.,39551,2
39552,Cool look but it feels incredibly cheap.,39552,2
39552,Frames came in a little bent and I can see how any little tug would break them,39552,2
39553,Way too small.,39553,2
39553,Trying to give it away,39553,2
39554,VERY thin material,39554,2
39555,The loose knit fabric cuts into the bottom of the foot.,39555,2
39555,could use a tighter knit in the foot to avoid this.,39555,2
39556,Pretty necklace but it tangles constantly which makes it very inconvenient to wear,39556,2
39557,Used it to make a jellyfish and it broke in less than an hour.,39557,2
39557,Sucks.,39557,2
39558,These were my first foray into the clipless world.,39558,2
39558,I thought why spend a lot of money to experiment with?,39558,2
39558,"I thought I was doing something wrong, it was very difficult to clip in the first time, but after trying different setups and learning more about clipless systems, I learned it wasn't me.",39558,2
39558,These pedals are very unbalanced and have a tendency to want to hang almost upside down!,39558,2
39558,Making it very hard to clip in.,39558,2
39558,I do not recommend these to anyone let alone beginners.,39558,2
39558,The shoes however are not bad...,39558,2
39559,"when I washed it the water turned red, it colorfast",39559,2
39560,Didn't like the material,39560,2
39561,This is way too small.,39561,2
39561,Order 2 sizes up.,39561,2
39562,It's too small.,39562,2
39562,Should be advertised for a child.,39562,2
39563,The D-ring are really huge.,39563,2
39563,Prefer them to be smaller.,39563,2
39564,eh not bad I guess.,39564,2
39564,The fabric is pretty heavy and weighs the garment down on your shoulders causing it to look stretched as you wear it.,39564,2
39565,Much smaller than expected based on sizing chart.,39565,2
39566,Too long size 16 and 5 foot two -to long,39566,2
39567,Glue comes through on back.,39567,2
39567,"Seem strong, but when half the pack looks like there are grease stains on the heel, no thanks.",39567,2
39567,Hope they contact me to send better one's.,39567,2
39568,Very disappointing.,39568,2
39568,This slip is much too short and does not have adjustable straps.,39568,2
39568,"I'm only 5' 5"".",39568,2
39568,"It's too short to show beneath the hem of my short dresses, and even my tunics!",39568,2
39568,"Not sure I can use it, unless I hem it up a tad bit and use it with a regular length top.",39568,2
39568,It may work as a slip for someone much shorter than my average height.,39568,2
39569,Ok,39569,2
39570,This product was not sticky enough to warrant its purchase.,39570,2
39570,The cup was NOT a D and I was gapping everywhere.,39570,2
39570,It provides no lift whatsoever and it extends too far towards the arm pit so it cannot be worn with anything backless.,39570,2
39570,I returned this product,39570,2
39571,tiny.,39571,2
39571,too small,39571,2
39572,Good product but not practical for daily use.,39572,2
39572,Guys with a few extra pounds not recommend.,39572,2
39573,The belt looks nice but started falling apart after 3 uses.,39573,2
39573,"I was going to return it, but I have to pay the shipping to return and it cost almost as much as the belt.",39573,2
39573,"Save your money, don't buy this.",39573,2
39574,Terrible quality.,39574,2
39574,I will not order from them again.,39574,2
39575,This watch is beautiful but the band faded after the very first wear.,39575,2
39576,Blouse fits but looks more like a cheap pajama top.,39576,2
39576,Not crazy about the material,39576,2
39577,"Looked great when I tried it on, but how can I give higher than 2 stars to a product that developed a hole in the crotch/butt after merely 5 hours of wearing it?",39577,2
39577,I'm highly disappointed and will avoid purchasing anything from this company because I doubt anything else is quality made.,39577,2
39578,"Nice shades, but breaks fairly easy.",39578,2
39578,Had them for about 4 weeks before the plastic snapped off the front.,39578,2
39579,I usually don't write reviews like this but i would not spend your money on this looks nothing like the picture.,39579,2
39579,"Sure, you can make it work with an outfit but was certainly not what I thought i would be receiving and took a month to get to me not worth your time or money....",39579,2
39579,Sorry,39579,2
39580,Runs very small,39580,2
39581,These were WAY smaller than I expected!,39581,2
39581,"and they pinched my sons feet so bad, he was limping while wearing them.",39581,2
39582,Shoulders don't lay as expected they don't stay around shoulders they bunch around to the neck,39582,2
39583,Not bad for the price,39583,2
39584,This item is MUCH prettier in the picture.,39584,2
39585,I ordered a bigger size than normal because of the size chart and it was still too small..,39585,2
39585,The bottoms were the problem..,39585,2
39585,I am not a big girl but the bottoms did not cover much at all.,39585,2
39586,almost transparent fabric,39586,2
39587,I was disappointed that this looked nothing like the photo and was so cheaply made I was ashamed to give it as a gift.,39587,2
39587,Some of the words and part of the verse could not even be read,39587,2
39588,The stitches are very (VERY) low quality and are coming off after only 4 days of use.,39588,2
39588,The strap has a good look...but the stitches ruined my expectations.,39588,2
39589,They look like stripper underwear too much for my taste.,39589,2
39590,cute ball locket but very cheap looking chain and the paper inside was poorly folded trash.,39590,2
39590,this item took a long time to arrive.,39590,2
39591,I don't like it.,39591,2
39591,The jumper looks nothing like the photo.,39591,2
39591,The color and material is MUCH darker.,39591,2
39591,It reminds me of some 1960s jumper Pam Grier would have worn in Foxy Brown.,39591,2
39591,Nothing tribal about this thing.,39591,2
39591,It's loud and tacky looking.,39591,2
39591,Save your money.,39591,2
39592,Cute bikini but way too small!,39592,2
39592,I ordered a large because sizes ran small but this was like a kid size!,39592,2
39592,Material was very thin too.,39592,2
39592,Do not recommend unless you are buying for a child,39592,2
39593,Cheap looks better in picture...but what did I  expect for low prices.,39593,2
39594,"The dress it's self was lovely and looked great but I bought a size that should have fit based on my measurements and it wasn't just too small, it was tiny.",39594,2
39594,I can't were the dress at all,39594,2
39595,Zipper sticks and hard to close or open,39595,2
39596,I was very excited when I received this hat.,39596,2
39596,It didn't look anything like the picture.,39596,2
39596,It looked like a giant mickey mouse ear bow that stood straight up.,39596,2
39596,I was so sad!!,39596,2
39596,I returned it.,39596,2
39597,Size up for this one ladies.,39597,2
39597,I ordered this tank along with the Coachella Empire Top both in a size 14.,39597,2
39597,I wear a size 12 clothes but chest size in bathing suits are always too small.,39597,2
39597,Coachella fit perfectly but this one was too tight in both bust and underarms.,39597,2
39598,These are one sided so they are lacking especially when they turn around.,39598,2
39599,Looked like the picture kind of but the material is very different....its really rough,39599,2
39600,Pretty design but poorly executed.,39600,2
39600,"The sewing was gathered on the side seams, because of the double layer of material in the front, it pulled across the back so the pleats do not lay.",39600,2
39600,I was really disappointed in this because I liked the design.,39600,2
39600,I couldn't even wear it!!!,39600,2
39600,!,39600,2
39601,It's not made very well!,39601,2
39602,Flimsy and completely lightweight plastic.,39602,2
39603,The print is really fuzzy and makes it looks cheap on the whole.,39603,2
39603,Which I guess it is for the price I paid.,39603,2
39603,I'll wear it at home.,39603,2
39604,Way too small.,39604,2
39604,"I normally wear a medium,  I got a large to be safe and it's so small you can see my belly button through it.",39604,2
39605,The top of the sock that goes over your thigh is too tight!!,39605,2
39605,The elastic is not wide enough,39605,2
39606,Cute bathing suit but its way too small.,39606,2
39606,I normally wear a small so I got aa size up and it was still too small,39606,2
39607,I bought this bracelet as a gift for my soon to be step daughter for her dad's and my wedding.,39607,2
39607,Not very impressed but it works for a 10 year old.,39607,2
39608,did not fit like the measurements said,39608,2
39609,They will not stay in place if you have long hair.,39609,2
39610,only small in the crotch... was walking not expected?,39610,2
39611,Maybe this shirt is really for a child?,39611,2
39612,"I bought a pair, and they broke in the first 2 weeks.",39612,2
39612,I'm only giving 2 stars because the customer service was good the first time around replacing them promptly.,39612,2
39612,The only problem... the replacement pair broke as well.,39612,2
39612,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.",39612,2
39613,Ripped in crotch area first wear.,39613,2
39614,"Its a pretty necklace, however its very cheap.",39614,2
39614,"When i took it out of it bag, i noticed how light and flimsy the necklace actually was.",39614,2
39614,"As i was trying to put the necklace on, the back of it can loose.",39614,2
39614,Not shocked because of the price.,39614,2
39614,Think before buying this particular necklace.,39614,2
39615,MATERIAL ALMOST REMINDED ME OF A SWEATSHIRT MATERIAL AND THE FRONT BUST AREA WAS A LITTLE STRANGE.,39615,2
39615,WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I WAS EXPECTING LOOKING AT THE PHOTO.,39615,2
39616,Way way bigger than they should be.,39616,2
39616,Order two sizes down.,39616,2
39617,Too large but good quality,39617,2
39618,The shoes this company puts out are soooo cute!,39618,2
39618,So I ordered my daughter a pair at the end of September.,39618,2
39618,"Out of he box, one of the bows had fallen off and three days later, while she was wearing them, the other bow fell off.",39618,2
39618,"They sagged at the bottom and were very awkward for her and not comfortable, and absolutely NO arch support, just flat.",39618,2
39618,But she LOVED them so she kept wearing them.,39618,2
39618,It is now nearing the end of January and the shoes are in the garbage.,39618,2
39618,"The heels disconnected from the shoes and the laces, trim and EVERYTHING pretty much disintegrated.",39618,2
39618,She didn't even wear these every day.,39618,2
39618,Normal usage and they fell apart.,39618,2
39618,So I came online to get her new shoes.,39618,2
39618,"I found an adorable pair but the company name looked familiar and, sure enough, same company.",39618,2
39618,SUCH adorable and unique shoes!,39618,2
39618,But they are crap!,39618,2
39618,Major bummer.,39618,2
39619,I was disappointed because  I really fell in love with these shoes but my daughter can not fit them,39619,2
39620,Returning the size is waaay too small to be a Large.,39620,2
39620,It was suppose to be a Christmas gift but now I gotta return it and give something else.,39620,2
39621,They were baggy all over.,39621,2
39621,Much too large,39621,2
39622,very thinnn,39622,2
39623,"Beautiful dress, but way to small.",39623,2
39623,Have to return it and it was for a special occasion so we will not need another one.,39623,2
39623,It is about 2 sizes too small for my daughter who is a size 0.,39623,2
39624,"This ankle looks great, and I like the noise it makes when I walk around.",39624,2
39624,"The coins, however,  started falling off very quickly.",39624,2
39624,It is for this reason that I'm giving it two stars.,39624,2
39625,Awful material and very difficult to deal with the seller by email.,39625,2
39625,Don't buy it,39625,2
39626,The top is too small for a medium and the bottom too big.,39626,2
39626,Does not bring the side pockets as the pic & the quality of the material is mediocre very thin.,39626,2
39627,"Went by suggested weight and height , but still too small .",39627,2
39627,Returning,39627,2
39628,This short was very thin material.,39628,2
39628,It was extremely petite.,39628,2
39628,I couldn't wear it.,39628,2
39628,Fortunately it was super cheap so I threw it away.,39628,2
39628,(Wasn't even worth donating),39628,2
39629,So thin!,39629,2
39629,"Will work for fall, but not for the real winter with snow and freezing temperatures.",39629,2
39630,Runs big the material is cheap but okay came with a black marks on it,39630,2
39631,"This shirt came 3 weeks after the ""expected date"".",39631,2
39631,The picture depicts a shirt with the large design on the back and one on the front chest.,39631,2
39631,The shirt I received has a design on the front only.,39631,2
39632,Snap on the outer main pocket ripped off within seconds of opening it.,39632,2
39632,I agree with the comments as noted in the 1 or 2 star ratings: it's super cute but will not hold up to the day 2 day rigors of what it was intended to do.,39632,2
39633,WAY too big and very ugly as to what it looked like in the picture.,39633,2
39634,3 sizes to small.,39634,2
39635,"Very cheap material, cut very bad... Not happy",39635,2
39636,I had a coat like this a few years ago it doesn't seem like the same coat.,39636,2
39636,My fear I may have to buy another coat maybe one that's thicker and heavier.,39636,2
39637,"order this bead and was very happy with it, until a month passed and the color rubbed off.",39637,2
39638,Not a product flaw but these were too big and heavy for me.,39638,2
39639,Color is BEAUTIFUL!,39639,2
39639,Length is GREAT!,39639,2
39639,"Sleeves are not proportioned - this has been the only top purchased with cuffs 4"" too short!",39639,2
39640,cheap but for the price that is expected,39640,2
39641,was not as show I got 2 pair each of 4 of the ones shown was hoping for better,39641,2
39642,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but the shirt I received is not the one advertised.",39642,2
39642,"On the sleeves, there are silver details, instead of the black buttons.",39642,2
39642,The length on the back is the same as the front one.,39642,2
39642,Definitely not what I expected.,39642,2
39643,Very thin.,39643,2
39643,You can see right through them.,39643,2
39643,Never again!,39643,2
39644,We ordered this dress in plum for my sister-in-law's wedding.,39644,2
39644,The photo shows a gorgeous dress that looks to be made of chiffon or taffeta.,39644,2
39644,The dress came and it was not at all what we expected.,39644,2
39644,The dress had two layers of tulle and an under layer of silk.,39644,2
39644,"The dress was no where near close to plum, it was more fuchsia than anything.",39644,2
39644,I would not recommend this dress.,39644,2
39645,Too small,39645,2
39646,"It looks nice, but it's super thin.",39646,2
39646,"If I had known it was so thin, I wouldn't have gone with another one.",39646,2
39646,Update: I had to down grade this by a star because the shoes are already falling apart.,39646,2
39646,My son has worn them twice.,39646,2
39646,Cheaply made with cheap materials.,39646,2
39646,Not worth the price I paid.,39646,2
39647,"Dislike, because of the size chart ran small.",39647,2
39648,"I am normally a medium, therefore I ordered a medium - unless you have a rock-hard body, with no baby bulges - go bigger in size.",39648,2
39648,"Also, upon returning I have to pay to ship it back.",39648,2
39649,Loved the print and dress quality.,39649,2
39649,Sizing is way off.,39649,2
39650,"Runs super super small, OK quality.",39650,2
39651,The moon part of the purse did not look like it did in the picture sadly.,39651,2
39652,Somewhat disappointing.,39652,2
39652,"Not the color I wanted, yet not too far off.",39652,2
39652,"Brim too wide, texture of fabric thicker than desired.",39652,2
39653,"I hate giving 2-stars or fewer, but in this case I had to - because the name of the item is complete rubbish, misleading and incorrect.",39653,2
39653,"There may be no RAISED seams on the OUTSIDE of these tights/compression pants, but there are very clear, defined and scratchy seams on the inside - in the crotch and down the entire leg.",39653,2
39653,"I was SUPER disappointed, especially given the title, because I bought these for my nephew, who struggles with sensory overload issues... in order to get him to wear most any pants, he has to wear tights, leggings or similar bottoms under jeans, etc.",39653,2
39653,"because the seams irritate him to the point that he's crying, screaming and throwing the pants on the ground.",39653,2
39653,Obviously these did not work.,39653,2
39653,"To be fair to the brand, the quality seemed great - fabric, fit, cut, etc... all good.",39653,2
39653,"But they are NOT ""seamless"" by any means, and that was both a bummer and source of major annoyance, since I had to repack them, make a trip to the post and send them back.",39653,2
39654,Bottoms where to small and the top was used had stains on it like some one use it and not just a little,39654,2
39655,"I loved the design of this bag, and in theory it would have been great for an overnight flight with an early-morning arrival.",39655,2
39655,"You put your change of clothes and toiletries in the bottom, and avoid cluttering up the main compartment with stuff you don't need for the flight itself.",39655,2
39655,"It slides over your suitcase handle, and has a nice outside pocket for tickets and such.",39655,2
39655,"And the long shoulder strap could go across your body, to make hauling it through the airport much easier, right?",39655,2
39655,The design was exactly what I was looking for.,39655,2
39655,"In reality, the long strap was too thin, and dug into my shoulder badly.",39655,2
39655,"So I ordered a shoulder pad that velcroed onto it, and figured I would be set for the trip.",39655,2
39655,But the hardware on the shoulder strap snapped like a twig before I even got to the gate.,39655,2
39655,"Granted, I had it stuffed pretty full, but isn't that the point of a large bag like this?",39655,2
39655,"The material of the bag itself was fairly plastic-y and stiff, but seemed sturdy enough, and the bottom corners were reinforced.",39655,2
39655,"It wasn't a terribly expensive bag, so I could have lived with that.",39655,2
39655,"But the hardware was beyond flimsy, and too small to take the weight of even an overnight-flight's worth of clothes and neck pillows.",39655,2
39655,"I continued to use it on my trip without the shoulder strap, but when it was expanded, it was too tall to carry by the handles without being kicked or dragging the ground; and they weren't quite long enough to make carrying it over my shoulder comfortable when it was full.",39655,2
39655,"Overall, a nice design, but the hardware needs to be sturdier.",39655,2
39656,Poorly made does not fit properly,39656,2
39657,I could barely get it over my head and it was way too small in the bust area.,39657,2
39657,Material was very plastic feeling too.,39657,2
39657,Liked colors and design but that was it.,39657,2
39658,The bottoms are so fragile feeling you have to tie them so tight in order for you not too fall out and then it looks like they're cutting off your circulation,39658,2
39659,Material too thin need to  be lined.,39659,2
39660,OMG...the fabric on this dress is like the fabric on a Halloween costume.,39660,2
39660,"Save your money...this one is cheap, cheap, cheap!!!!!",39660,2
39660,!,39660,2
39661,"Although this bag can hold a lot, it's cheaply made.",39661,2
39661,The color is worn and the zipper broke almost immediately.,39661,2
39661,It's really not worth more than 10 bucks.,39661,2
39662,"Decent hat, well-made, however, slouchy it's not!",39662,2
39662,Once you put it on your head only two points stick up like animal ears.,39662,2
39662,The hat does not drape at all as it appears to on model.,39662,2
39662,Misleading.,39662,2
39663,I didn't pay a lot for it and  you get what you pay for.,39663,2
39663,there was practically no elastic under the breast to make it fitted and the halter is just some of that black trim sewn on and not really even finished off.,39663,2
39663,"I like the bathrobe but the belt is sewn so that there is a raw edge, they didn't turn it inside out to hide it.",39663,2
39664,At least 2 sizes too small.,39664,2
39665,Not as nice as I expected for me at least.,39665,2
39665,I returned it.,39665,2
39665,Fit a lil big...,39665,2
39666,THE ITEM IS VERY PRETTY BUT THE SIZING IS TO SMALL.WISH IT WASNT WOULD OF LOVED TO WEAR,39666,2
39667,Not my favorite purchase.,39667,2
39667,"I should've paid attention to its material... the picture made me wanna think it was cotton, it's not.",39667,2
39667,it's mostly nylon and makes me feel hot and sweaty in less than 2 minutes.,39667,2
39667,2 stars for the colors...,39667,2
39667,It looks pretty.,39667,2
39667,too bad it's unbearable,39667,2
39668,"I'm giving the dress 2 stars b/c it was exactly as pictured, but it didn't fit at all.",39668,2
39668,I bought it in a small and it was really huge!,39668,2
39668,I bought a similar dress in white from a different seller and this dress didn't hug my body in a fitted way like the white one did.,39668,2
39668,It was loose all over the place.,39668,2
39668,It's not worth returning for an exchange or refund so I'm stuck w/ it.,39668,2
39668,I'll probably give it away.,39668,2
39669,"This ended up being too large so I'm returning it but even if it fit, the material feels very cheap.",39669,2
39670,The material is so thin it's thinner than if it were made from toilet paper.,39670,2
39671,it doesn't fit as in the photo.,39671,2
39671,It is just a long t shirt.,39671,2
39672,looks cheap in person,39672,2
39673,Came to me all scuffed up.,39673,2
39673,"Otherwise, cool necklace.",39673,2
39674,To small not as thick as it looks on line.,39674,2
39675,U suk,39675,2
39676,Not flattering at all.,39676,2
39676,Just really not impressed with this dress.,39676,2
39677,"After several weeks of waiting, this finally arrived today.",39677,2
39677,"I took it out of the package and immediately noticed that there was no ""push-up built-in padding"" in the top, nor were there ""attached boy shorts.""",39677,2
39677,"I only received the top dress part, no bottoms at all.",39677,2
39677,"Well, okay, for the price, I can pick up some matching bottoms pretty easily.",39677,2
39677,"But I can't work with the top - without any padding or anything, it is just flimsy fabric with absolutely no support whatsoever.",39677,2
39677,"I did try it on, just to see how the sizing was, and it fits as expected.",39677,2
39677,"I'm carrying some extra weight currently, and the XL was still plenty roomy.",39677,2
39677,"It was inexpensive, and maybe I'll find a way to make it work as a cover-up or something.......",39677,2
39678,Be aware that the ears are NOT attached to the smooth headband.,39678,2
39678,You have to slide them on and they can slide down again while wearing the headband.,39678,2
39678,If you want to take the time to sew or glue  them in place they would be better.,39678,2
39678,I wanted to return them but was told I would have to pay to ship them back to China.,39678,2
39678,Seller knows that no one will actually do that as would cost more to ship them than cost of item.,39678,2
39678,Description should have included that fabric ears are not attached to headband.,39678,2
39678,Not a terrible product but not what I was expecting.,39678,2
39679,Liked the material but didn't fit well.,39679,2
39679,But will say that I have very small legs and ankles so that's were my problems were.,39679,2
39679,If you are a thicker women they may work.,39679,2
39680,It came way smaller than the size it said it would be.,39680,2
39680,The black also looks more like shamu than a shark.,39680,2
39681,Fits well and looks nice.,39681,2
39681,It is however NOT cotton.,39681,2
39681,"The tag says 95% Lenzing Viscose, 5% Spandex.",39681,2
39681,I would have otherwise gave it a much better rating.,39681,2
39682,"Very pretty, but halfway through dinner it broke.....embarrassing....",39682,2
39683,"This is made out of really tight bathing suit material (slick, shiny).",39683,2
39683,I had to really force it over my 36D tits and it's not really comfy.,39683,2
39683,This is probably the most disappointing things I've ever bought from Amazon.,39683,2
39684,Beautiful top at a good price - eBay has it at double the price.,39684,2
39684,The problem is that they aren't true to size - Size chart is wrong - Medium is actually a size XS!,39684,2
39685,"It fitted larget when I tried it on, but it shrank a quite bit after I washed it.",39685,2
39686,Junk,39686,2
39687,Fits really really tight.,39687,2
39687,I have a normal size head and this gives me the worst headache 30 min into wearing.,39687,2
39687,I've been stretching it on a soccer ball for weeks.,39687,2
39687,"I've seen a little improvement, but not enough to be able to wear it distance running yet.",39687,2
39687,It needs an adjuster on the back.,39687,2
39688,Sleeves were very short.,39688,2
39688,I thought it would be longer.,39688,2
39689,pretty colors cut was too narrow in arms,39689,2
39690,Should have been longer,39690,2
39691,"I only had this item for less than a month, and the strap has already ripped out, and the attachable strap has broken as well.",39691,2
39691,On the metal part.,39691,2
39691,"So no, this purse did not work for me.",39691,2
39692,Smaller than expected and the eye hooks are not secured well,39692,2
39693,son thought they were the coolest for the first few weeks.,39693,2
39693,"After about 10 days, the lights starting going out.",39693,2
39693,( yes we charged them) the charge only holds a few hours at most.,39693,2
39694,"the size runs small to size , plus came in with a broken zipper , in the process of returning.",39694,2
39695,did not like it or the fit sent it back.,39695,2
39696,within one hour of wearing it turned green very dissatisfied,39696,2
39697,Poor quality of construction.,39697,2
39697,Thin fabric.,39697,2
39698,Thins layers pressed together.,39698,2
39698,Came apart in a month,39698,2
39699,Way too small...,39699,2
39699,I got the XLarge and it's like a juniors medium,39699,2
39700,Cheaply made.,39700,2
39700,One of the straps already broke under normal use.,39700,2
39701,"The fit is nice and it's comfortable, but the patch is poorly sewn on with WHITE thread and the material is creating fuzzies after some wear.",39701,2
39701,"The shirt doesn't look like the picture, just similar.",39701,2
39701,If you want what you see in the picture then don't buy this item.,39701,2
39701,If you aren't too picky and just want a black and white crop for cheep then this is the way to go.,39701,2
39702,It doesn't look at all like the picture!,39702,2
39702,The material seems cheaper and the colors are more opaque.,39702,2
39702,"Too bad, seemed nice in the picture.",39702,2
39703,I do know that you get what you pay for but I was expecting a better quality based on reviews.,39703,2
39703,"Poorly made and so small that ""love"" print looked stretched out.",39703,2
39703,would not recommend buying this product.,39703,2
39704,not very well tailored and fits like XXL rather than XL,39704,2
39705,"I am very disappointed with this order, I ordered 3 shirts all the same size and I always cut the tags out before I wash them.",39705,2
39705,"Well, as I was putting the tags in the trash I noticed one tag was for a 2x--I ordered 3x...and since I had cut the tags out I realized that I could not return it....lesson learned- never cut the tags out without looking first.",39705,2
39706,Very comfy and fits well.,39706,2
39706,However I accidentally snagged them on something and since the fabric is so thin they ripped.,39706,2
39706,I don't recommend wearing these for errands or housework.,39706,2
39707,"So I needed a strapless, backless bra for a dress that I wore out on a recent May evening.",39707,2
39707,I was in my car on the way to the event when the bra fell off.,39707,2
39707,"Admittedly DC is very hot and sweat happens, but the only dresses I have that would need a bra like this are summer dresses.",39707,2
39707,So disappointed.,39707,2
39708,Definitely runs super small.,39708,2
39708,"Order a minimum of one size up, please.",39708,2
39708,The design is fabulous.,39708,2
39708,The fit .............not so fabulous,39708,2
39709,"shirt fits very small, and it's not preshrunk cotton",39709,2
39710,"Absolutely gorgeous, but too small.",39710,2
39711,Disappointed in my purchase.,39711,2
39711,The black was faded on the top almost like it had been worn or bleached by the sun.,39711,2
39711,Not a flattering fit either.,39711,2
39711,It seemed to be a bit large.,39711,2
39712,"bottom fit eh :/
length:  lil past my knees
doesn't hug ur body - its a little loose
the top is tiny like sports bra
i even try to mix the bottom with a different crop top but the material is very thin lil cheapi looking..",39712,2
39713,I expected chunky sweater as one size fits all.,39713,2
39713,I usually wear medium and this is almost too tight.,39713,2
39713,Not at all what I expected.,39713,2
39714,The American USA flag print legging we received were of normal looking legging size almost.,39714,2
39714,About an inch smaller in the waist when un-stretched.,39714,2
39714,"The problem was they had no stretch in the length, none at all, and only limited stretch in the width.",39714,2
39714,With these issues the legging would not even stretch enough to pull up to even the level of the hips.,39714,2
39714,The print was just great looking though.,39714,2
39714,The item came in a re-closable pouch so it was odd that the white part of the print shows small dark smudges or stains.,39714,2
39714,"Also people are describing different flag prints were received, it would be helpful if they posted images of the ones they got and the fit they got from them.",39714,2
39714,Shorter and thinner people would probably not have a problem with this item.,39714,2
39715,It did fit and work just fine but the finish was terrible.,39715,2
39715,The black was chipped away between the links and the gold was peeling away at the corners.,39715,2
39716,It doesn't fit well.,39716,2
39716,I bought an XXL but its feels like a medium,39716,2
39717,If you are a teen going for a cute trippy look.,39717,2
39717,This is not it.,39717,2
39718,shirt looked nothing like the picture..didn't like it at all!,39718,2
39718,:(,39718,2
39719,"Very cute, also very cheap materials.",39719,2
39720,The stop was quite big and awkwardly made.,39720,2
39720,Didn't love the fabric either/,39720,2
39721,Over priced for something that was pasted/ironed on a Green T-Shirt.,39721,2
39721,Could have done this myself.,39721,2
39722,Don't bother.,39722,2
39722,"Very cheap, and doesn't look like the picture, you get what you pay for.",39722,2
39723,Chain is good quality/color but the image of the black kitten is distorted over the eyes like an air bubble got stuck or the glue dried blurry.,39723,2
39723,So its hard to tell what the image is.,39723,2
39723,"It also feels like a plastic cabochon, I asked for a refund.",39723,2
39724,Broke at heart after about a month,39724,2
39725,I loved this purse when I first got it.,39725,2
39725,It has plenty of room and it is  a neutral color.,39725,2
39725,Sadly the shoulder strap broke about a month after I received it and one of the belt straps always  comes undone.,39725,2
39725,The opening of the purse is a bit small and makes it hard to find stuff.,39725,2
39726,Does not look like the picture .,39726,2
39726,Halter crochet and very short .,39726,2
39726,Fits like a bikini,39726,2
39727,Broke after 3-days.,39727,2
39727,Disappointing because it looked nice.,39727,2
39728,I ordered a 2x and it was still to small.,39728,2
39729,"I liked the color, and the fabric, but was just much too large for me.",39729,2
39729,"I had a medium, but it would have fitted a very large person!",39729,2
39730,It's cute but 1. the purse is not leather as advertised 2.,39730,2
39730,"It is not ILISHOP, but some off brand with no markings.",39730,2
39730,I wish I'd have read the other critical reviews.,39730,2
39730,Only keeping the bag b/c it's functional.,39730,2
39731,necklace broke from wearing it,39731,2
39732,Cheaply made,39732,2
39733,"I got the rainbow ring, I love the ring!",39733,2
39733,But IT DOES turn you green!,39733,2
39733,Obviously for $5 it will!,39733,2
39733,"But I'm disappointed that it says it's sterling silver, which is BS!",39733,2
39733,I have 4 other rings I wear all day every day and they're sterling silver and DON'T turn me green!,39733,2
39733,I've had it for a few days and it's tarnished already.,39733,2
39733,Like I said it's a cheap $5 ring so what would you expect.,39733,2
39733,Just really wish it was sterling silver!,39733,2
39733,I love this ring!,39733,2
39733,Dang it!,39733,2
39733,Does anyone know where I can get a ring like this where it doesn't turn you green?,39733,2
39733,!,39733,2
39734,"I'm 5'4"" and about 115 lbs and the top fits fine.",39734,2
39734,The problem is the skirt is very short and came just under my butt.,39734,2
39734,"The bottom hem of the skirt was unfinished, meaning you can see the sewing lock stitch.",39734,2
39734,The material is a shiny type of fabric.,39734,2
39735,You get what you pay for.,39735,2
39735,"Cheaply made trinket, good for a party favor but not long time wear.",39735,2
39736,I loved this ring when I first got it.,39736,2
39736,"Now, after 2 months the plating has come off and it looks awful!",39736,2
39736,"It is not worth it,  as my finger is turning green whenever I wear it.",39736,2
39737,"Nice shirt well made great fit ,when I ordered I checked green 2xl Big ,it flipped to black ,I did not notice I just paid attention to the picture which was green ,I received a black shirt it takes a long time time for a refund and they don't allow a exchange ,be careful think twice ,is the  possible wait worth it?",39737,2
39738,Nice colors but it was too small even in the large size..,39738,2
39739,some socks were so small you cant wear them  don't buy,39739,2
39740,"Bought one for my mother, it snaped after a months use, throwing beads everywhere;  thought it was a fluke so I bought her a second one...and it happend again.",39740,2
39740,"Really pretty though, just not very sturdy.",39740,2
39741,Looks good for a bracelet.,39741,2
39741,Bought it hoping it would hold a hair tie but it kept slipping off.,39741,2
39742,The material is too thin.,39742,2
39742,Would not feel comfortable actually wearing this to work out.,39742,2
39743,I ordered a 24.,39743,2
39743,"I am a 24, but these were so tight I had to take them off.",39743,2
39743,No way!,39743,2
39743,I would recommend buying one size up for sure.,39743,2
39743,Just to be safe.,39743,2
39744,these are also a little small but what bothers me more is the material.,39744,2
39744,they look like linen in the picture and they're that rayon or whatever the stuff is on the other one.,39744,2
39744,wrinkles easily and sweat shows a lot more.,39744,2
39745,"its a Beautifull dress, but you need to ask for 2 more size you are xs ask for M",39745,2
39746,Broke off in no time.,39746,2
39746,Only used it once.,39746,2
39746,Gave two stars because at least it was cute.,39746,2
39747,The fit of this tshirt is odd.,39747,2
39747,Lots of gathering in the back if neck in this shirt.,39747,2
39747,"I can typically give things to my mom when they don't fit me how I like it, but she had the same problem.",39747,2
39747,Shipping was fast and the return was easy.,39747,2
39747,"Material is thin and seems like it would tear easily,",39747,2
39748,its not as long as the picture its not as full an there is a white part in the middle i don't like it,39748,2
39749,"Loved this shirt, love Bernie Sanders...",39749,2
39749,"But I wore this shirt ONCE, washed it, and now there's already a hole in it.",39749,2
39749,How is that even possible?,39749,2
39749,Ugh.,39749,2
39750,Definitely a $10 hat.,39750,2
39750,Feels cheep and has an irregular shape that won't go back to normal over time.,39750,2
39750,Packaging may have something to do with the odd shape so that could be a factor that needs changing as well.,39750,2
39751,I eagerly anticipated receiving this coat and even got it earlier than I expected.,39751,2
39751,"However, I was sorely disappointed when the coat arrived without the necessary attachment for the hood.",39751,2
39752,Far too small.,39752,2
39752,"If you wear XXL or even XL hats, this will be too small.",39752,2
39752,"Moreover, it came with small holes in the straw of the crown, so don't think this will give you 100% scalp protection.",39752,2
39753,wife said didn't fit,39753,2
39754,Pointless....,39754,2
39754,They turn once you put them on.,39754,2

39756,"Cute pants,  but super small elastic waist.",39756,2
39756,"Was under the impression that it was a drawstring waist,  but it's not.",39756,2
39757,"I got my wife 5'3"" 110lbs this dress in the smallest size and it was still way too big.",39757,2
39757,Also it had a weird line caused by an extra layer of fabric around the midsection.,39757,2
39758,"Not dislike, but size medium is actually a size small.",39758,2
39759,"They were cute, but the zipper broke after the first time I wore them.",39759,2
39759,And they did smell terrible.,39759,2
39759,I returned them.,39759,2
39760,"It looks as it is on the picture , but it's not 32 cm.",39760,2
39760,It's much smaller.,39760,2

39761,Way small!,39761,2
39761,"I ""donated"" these to tiny friends....wasn't worth it to send back and pay postage.",39761,2
39761,These were medium.,39761,2
39761,If I were goi g to order this product again I think I would order XL.,39761,2
39761,And I'm normally a size 8!,39761,2
39762,Very cute and simple ring.,39762,2
39762,"I wouldn't  pay full price, but I used some chase points and that help with the sting.",39762,2
39762,So far it hasn't faded so that's a plus.,39762,2
39762,It's my everyday ring.,39762,2
39762,UPDATE: It's now faded.....will definitely not replace with another Gorjana ring.,39762,2

39774,Thought I was getting real Persol lenses but they were plastic and didn't fit tight in the frame.,39774,2

39782,Very small and poorly made material.,39782,2
39783,"Too thin, too short and shrinks even more in the wash. Order at least 2 sizes bigger if you want it to hang even slightly.",39783,2
39784,Dress looked way prettier on line than it did in person.,39784,2
39784,It arrived with a tear in the tulle (and it didn't even look like tulle skirt in the picture) Sizing was odd (too large!),39784,2

39814,I'm waiting until after Christmas so my wife can try it on but most likely returning.,39814,2
39815,Seems like the sizes run small,39815,2
39816,"The bottoms fit great, seemed to be a good quality.",39816,2
39816,"I ordered a medium, I am a large A, small B.",39816,2
39816,The top was too small for my chest.,39816,2
39816,Very dissapointing.,39816,2
39816,I did return it.,39816,2
39817,I usually wear small size dress but this one is too big for me.,39817,2
39817,"Also, it's not beautiful like the picture shows; It's totally see-through and too loose at the waist and shoulder.",39817,2
39817,It's disappointed but return is too expensive...,39817,2
39818,My bottoms fit well but my top is a little too big.,39818,2
39818,"I love the style and the bikini in general, but the top being too large made me a little sad.",39818,2
39818,It.works but instead of the clasp I have to tie the back to secure it properly bummer but guess you have to do what you have to do.,39818,2
39819,"Super cute, but VERYYYY short!",39819,2
39819,"I Am 5'5"" 124 lbs and a large was too small!",39819,2
39820,I bought this leotard in a size 2-4 for my 2.5 year old.,39820,2
39820,"She is an average size for her age and while this item fit her, it did not leave much room to grow.",39820,2
39820,The skirt could be wrapped around two and a half times and still was slidding off of her.,39820,2
39820,However my concern wasn't with the size as much as it was with the condition of the items.,39820,2
39820,The leotard has dirt on the front and the back and the skirt has a hole in it.,39820,2
39820,I will be returning this item and purchasing elsewhere.,39820,2
39820,I'm bummed because this is a super cute leotard/skirt and my daughter loves it.,39820,2
39821,Always purchase a larger size... not what it's pictured to be... cheap material,39821,2
39822,"The ear muffs aren't made with the best quality material, so when the wind hits the side of the ears, it doesn't really do much to stop the wind.",39822,2
39822,Only works well when you have some sort of wind breakers hype hood to block the wind.,39822,2
39822,"Additionally, they are annoying because they don't fold up, so they take up a lot of room.",39822,2
39822,This is especially unfortunate because the portion that covers the ear is way too big.,39822,2
39822,It looks weird when wearing it without a hood covering the entire ear warmer.,39822,2
39822,I wouldn't recommend buying these.,39822,2
39822,Just pay a couple extra bucks and buy a better quality ear warmer.,39822,2
39823,Much smaller than expected.,39823,2
39824,"The fabric was nice and thick but the sizing of the upper portion was simply too large, and the chunky buttons ended up looking cheap in-person.",39824,2
39824,Looked more like children's clothing than a dress intended for adults.,39824,2
39824,The sizing may be more appropriate for those with long torsos.,39824,2
39825,The batwing is not as pronounced as it is in the photo.,39825,2
39825,I'm definitely annoyed.,39825,2
39825,Runs small.,39825,2
39826,It shrunk a lot,39826,2
39827,"Don't like the material and if you have any sort of bust, get two sizes bigger.",39827,2
39827,I don't recommend this product,39827,2
39828,Cute but way too small.,39828,2
39829,Too tight and the plastic seems easy to break.,39829,2
39830,"Having read the reviews here, I ordered XL whereas I usually wear L or sometimes M (185 cm, 180 pounds).",39830,2
39830,"Unfortunately, the shirt was like a tent on me, a true XL or maybe even XXL.",39830,2
39830,The body cut is much more square and wide than shown and the sleeves are also very wide.,39830,2
39830,The fabric is cheap polyester but the colours are great and just as shown.,39830,2
39830,"Sadly, sizing is too much of a gamble to risk trying another size and I've returned it.",39830,2
39831,Good concept but poor execution.,39831,2
39831,"The Asian XL was a little too large for my 34"" waist, but the nut pouch (not easily seen in the photo) was way too small.",39831,2
39831,The penis sleeve fit well and is stretchy when needed.,39831,2
39831,The fabric is smooth and silky and I liked it very much.,39831,2
39832,The shape was too plain for any face...,39832,2
39833,"I like it, but the button fell off the first time I wore them.",39833,2
39833,"I'm super disappointed, no I have to sew the button back on...ugh",39833,2
39834,nice product but runs big.,39834,2
39834,"if you are between a small and a medium, I would buy the small.",39834,2
39834,"following my own advice, I did buy a small but it was the exact same length as the medium.",39834,2
39834,Returning it.,39834,2
39835,"I am confused at others reviews of this ""outfit"".",39835,2
39835,My daughter has only ever worn this as summer pajamas.,39835,2
39835,"The material is ""pajama-like"" and the material is pretty thin.",39835,2
39835,I would not think to put this on my child as an outfit....only sleepwear.,39835,2
39836,"This is a very nice, high quality wallet.",39836,2
39836,You can tell a lot went into the craftsmanship and the materials are excellent.,39836,2
39836,The woven finish definitely brings a level of sophistication to the piece and the stitching is flawless.,39836,2
39836,The reason that I deducted 3 stars was because it suffers from a huge design flaw that no wallet of this caliber should ever suffer from.,39836,2
39836,"Because this is an 8 credit card wallet, it's 4 cards per side.",39836,2
39836,"They card slits are horizontal and so when you fill this wallet with cards, it sits closed flush and has a tendency to twist because the area of contact between to the 2 sides is too small.",39836,2
39836,"What this means is when you pull the wallet out of your pocket it has a disheveled look to it because it is presented as ""crooked"".",39836,2
39836,I'll live with this flaw but I won't buy another like it.,39836,2
39836,"I'll be stuck with this wallet for some time and I am ok with it because it is nice, it just has a messy look because the credit cards touch each other in a staggered formation when closed.",39836,2
39836,"This is ""teaching"" the leather a dis-symmetry that I will be fighting for the rest of the wallet's life.",39836,2
39836,I am including 2 pictures to illustrate my complaint - One of a side view to show how the credit cards sit against each when closed and one of the wallet a rest to show the effect of the design.,39836,2
39836,"If Montblanc or the Amazon seller wishes to rectify this I am welcome to do so and would restore my faith in these companies, however I fear they likely won't respond and I'm stuck with a fancy wallet that looks sloppy.",39836,2
39837,"The design is trendy and cute,  but the material is kind of cheap.",39837,2
39837,Also the neck whole was just a raw cut with no stitching.,39837,2
39837,Kind of weird,39837,2
39838,"The top is adorable but, after reading other reviews i ordered up 3 sizes, still too small.",39838,2
39838,Disappointed!!,39838,2
39838,!,39838,2
39839,To small I am retuning it,39839,2
39840,These boots run on the small side,39840,2
39841,Very cute but the butterfly literally fell off when I removed it from the package.,39841,2
39842,Laughably large.,39842,2
39842,May fit when she's 3 or 4.,39842,2
39842,"Definitely not high quality, but cute.",39842,2
39843,"Loved it at first and get lots of compliments on it, but it started tearing at the handle seams and even ripping in other areas after 9 months.",39843,2
39843,"I don't really fill the bag up with anythong heavy, just my wallet and phone.",39843,2
39843,"If it was a $20 bag I wouldn't complain, but for $50 I hoped it would last longer than 9 months.",39843,2
39844,The swimsuit fit fine.,39844,2
39844,I went according to the size chart provided by the seller.,39844,2
39844,I am returning the swimsuit because the scalloped edges don't stay up on their own when the suit is on.,39844,2
39844,Perhaps the material is too flimsy.,39844,2
39844,"When worn, the swimsuit looks like the picture if you fix the edges but they fall back down when you move.",39844,2
39845,"I order it in the blue and it fit perfectly, my husband loved it.",39845,2
39845,"So I ordered the red and black, they were cute but to small.",39845,2
39846,Chain of this I believe is plastic.,39846,2
39846,"Pendant is ok, had seen others I liked but don't plan on ordering anymore.",39846,2
39846,It takes a while for delivery.,39846,2
39846,I believe they ship from over seas.,39846,2
39847,way too big size chart inaccurate,39847,2
39848,Even though I took measurements..,39848,2
39848,This shirt does run on the small side.. A tad too tight..,39848,2
39848,I do like the quality and gifted to my mom.. Just was tighter than expected,39848,2
39849,The inner  band was 1-1/2 inches too short.,39849,2
39849,Because of this the buckle is on the side of my wrist and I can only use the last hole on the outer belt.,39849,2
39849,I have other bands like this and the inner band is longer.,39849,2
39849,Not happy with this one.,39849,2
39850,Not good quality,39850,2
39851,short in length,39851,2
39852,"Strange fit for an extra large; I wanted a ""big, easy t-shirt"" to sleep in, not this!",39852,2
39852,"Top half is narrow, the cut is just funky, not what I wanted but oh well.",39852,2
39853,I wore this necklace once and the color was changing through out the day that I had it on.,39853,2
39853,"It was cute when I first received it, but it just changed.",39853,2
39853,"I know that it was a cheap price and it wasn't real, but I wasn't expecting the color to fade so quickly.",39853,2
39854,too small even though i ordered large.,39854,2
39854,Sizes in asia seem to run smaller than what one is used to in the West,39854,2
39855,"The style and fit of this dress is fine and would very cute on, I expect.",39855,2
39855,"However, I really needed it to be cotton/poly as advertised but it's not.",39855,2
39855,"Spandex, nylon, cotton and poly blend.",39855,2
39855,Wish it would have worked out as it is a cute dress.,39855,2
39855,"(FYI, the red is MUCH brighter than it seems, though.",39855,2
39855,More of a tomato color than a deep red like it looks.),39855,2
39856,One pair was fine but the other pair had an obvious flaw in the  hinge and broke the second time I put them on.,39856,2
39856,Can I get a replacement?,39856,2
39857,Not the look I was expecting.,39857,2
39857,Appears cheaply made.,39857,2
39858,"The material of this is really crappy, and it fits me almost like a triangle it's so loose at the bottom.",39858,2
39858,And then the arms are really tight?,39858,2
39858,Very odd shirt.,39858,2
39858,I'm normally a M-L in shirts but I went with the L here so it would fit more on the loose side but not THAT loose.,39858,2
39858,It's not expensive but I would recommend even spending this little amount of money else where.,39858,2
39859,This is a really nice dress it was just somewhat too small,39859,2
39860,I bought this for my son but it didn't fit over his helmet.,39860,2
39860,"If you want to wear it over a helmet, go a size bigger.",39860,2
39861,I bought a large because it said that it runs small.,39861,2
39861,I usually wear a small or medium.,39861,2
39861,I am tall but skinny.,39861,2
39861,I got the tank top on but it is so tight that it left lines on my skin when I took it off.,39861,2
39861,Borderline uncomfortable!,39861,2
39862,They run larger than I expected and aren't exactly waterproof like I thought they were.,39862,2
39863,No inner lining... but I like it.,39863,2
39863,Update: I stored it properly with its original packaging and when i use it for the first time it broke.,39863,2
39864,Runs SUPER small.,39864,2
39864,Order up,39864,2
39865,Only worn a couple times and has ripped already.,39865,2
39865,Also rolls on the top making it dig inward.,39865,2
39866,Cute but material is thin and a little itchy.,39866,2
39866,Fits a little small so consider ordering up a size.,39866,2
39866,I have put it on a few times but haven't worn it out of the closet yet.,39866,2
39866,It looks cute on.,39866,2
39866,Will likely wear with leggings.,39866,2
39867,Item received not as shown but watch worked so kept it.,39867,2
39868,"Lace was discolored in some places, dressed smelled funny.",39868,2
39868,A few buttons on the back were loose and worried they were going to fall off.,39868,2
39868,I ended up returning due to these issue and the way the dress fit (I'm short and round so the waist line wasn't flattering) I did order a size up and for well.,39868,2
39869,"I am 5'5"", 125 pounds, 36 inch  hips and 26 inch waist.",39869,2
39869,The sizing chart was totally wrong.,39869,2
39869,All I will give this item is that it's extremely soft  and seems to be made well.,39869,2
39869,It's way too big even though I ordered right down the middle of the size chart.,39869,2
39869,It should fit perfectly.,39869,2
39869,"I don't see how, unless this was two sizes smaller that it would actually do what it says.",39869,2
39869,"But if it was two sizes smaller, it would also cause Huge bulges at the top of my thighs.",39869,2
39869,Just really didn't work.,39869,2
39869,Can't even get a refund or return it because I'm nowhere near a UPS store and by the time I paid to have UPS pick it up I'm going to be out pretty much the cost of the product.,39869,2
39869,So terrible service as well.,39869,2
39870,Not the best of quality and it arrived broken.,39870,2
39870,I had to fix it myself,39870,2
39871,They are just ok,39871,2
39872,Every nice ring liking it so far the only think is it could use more camo design its a little plan,39872,2
39873,The laminated card had several noticable bubbles.,39873,2
39873,"I could've attempted to make this myself but I figured if it's $10 then it'll be a bit more quality work, but it wasn't.",39873,2
39874,the stone fell out,39874,2
39875,Not attractive.,39875,2
39875,"The straps don't lay on right, and I have hips so you'd think it wouldn't be an issue.",39875,2
39875,"The top doesn't mold around your neck well, so your boobs pop out in the wrong ways, and I'm not that big on top.",39875,2
39875,I ended up cutting the central strips to create a two-piece--works better but the top is still off.,39875,2
39875,I likely will use the bottom and a different top.,39875,2
39876,fits small for busty women,39876,2
39877,its cute but i am a size M and got a M and its more like a S,39877,2
39878,"Top is thin and for a Size 14, I'm fairly endowed on top, and it barely covered the girls.",39878,2
39878,"It's like as the size increase, the coverage remained that of a B-Cup.",39878,2
39879,if you like the feeling of your pants undone all day then this is for you.,39879,2
39879,If not- don't bother,39879,2
39880,"Buttons waaaay bugger than in the picture, and the shirt fits OK only when it's  fully buttoned (shoulders too big).",39880,2
39880,"Not slim fit at all, even that my own body proportions are similar to the picture's.",39880,2
39880,Came pretty late too.,39880,2
39881,The length is far too short for someone over 5ft.,39881,2
39881,"I ordered a medium and it sets about three or four inches above my ankles, I'm only 5'4'' so I was rather disappointed for what it could have been.",39881,2
39882,Not true to size,39882,2
39883,Too big and the ear cuff does not stay put on the upper ear.,39883,2
39883,It flops off,39883,2
39884,WWAAAYYYYYY small,39884,2
39885,Wayyy too small,39885,2
39886,2 pairs of pants same size one fits good the other to small,39886,2
39887,Little small,39887,2
39888,The socks fit as expected and look nice but started falling apart and have holes after couple wears,39888,2
39889,Way too small!,39889,2
39889,I'm 5'7 and it barely stretched down to snap and if made it pull down on the chest too low.,39889,2
39889,Was also very thin.,39889,2
39890,It doesn't fit like it should and it looks so much better in the picture.,39890,2
39890,Also it is not very comfortable when you put it on,39890,2
39891,They don't stay up like in the picture.,39891,2
39891,If your pants don't come all the way down and cover your feet you will be able to see the top of the sock,39891,2
39892,Not what I expected at all.,39892,2
39893,"I ordered two of these, a couple days apart.",39893,2
39893,Received the second first.,39893,2
39893,Still waiting on my other.,39893,2
39893,"The sweater looks good, I will still wear it.",39893,2
39893,just because I'm cheap and already have it.,39893,2
39893,The problem with mine is the stitching is off.,39893,2
39893,"My left arm is very tight around my bicep and it does not align properly, like the other side.",39893,2
39893,I am 5'3 and ordered the m/l.,39893,2
39893,The arms fit me perfectly length wise.,39893,2
39893,if you are any taller I wouldn't suggest this.,39893,2
39894,Cheap looking,39894,2
39895,They run really small - I wear a medium or large depending on the quality of the clothing.,39895,2
39895,I ordered a large just to be cautions; the large fit like a small.,39895,2
39895,I would suggest ordering two(2) sizes up.,39895,2
39896,Really disappointed  with the product.,39896,2
39896,"im 5'1, usually wear a small or medium in most tops.",39896,2
39896,"I ordered a small, and while the sleeves are very short, almost too short, the sweatshirt itself is way too long and way too loose.",39896,2
39896,It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the bottom flares out a bit just before the hem.,39896,2
39896,"The color I ordered was the aquamarine and it doesn't look anything like the color portrayed in the description, it's more of a dark blue almost.",39896,2
39896,"All in all, it's really not what I was expecting - I was hoping for a nice fitted hoodie, but I might be able to salvage it if I take the bottom hem up a little more.",39896,2
39896,The shipping was very fast though.,39896,2
39897,This dress is very thin and not very durable material.,39897,2
39897,The hips part is made for a women whom is thick in the leg and waist region.,39897,2
39897,I don't care for the dress.,39897,2
39897,If you don't have the body of the lady in the picture don't buy this dress.,39897,2
39898,My bottom is to small,39898,2
39899,"It just doesn't hang right, it's kind of off.",39899,2
39899,And you can see the lines on my blouse where it ends on my chest and it is a bad look.,39899,2
39899,"I bought it because I had this sleeveless collared shirt I wear under sweaters all of the time and it is hard to find ones like that - ones that aren't very long, this sleeveless had a bottom that ended at the hem of most of my sweaters.",39899,2
39899,I thought this would be perfect but I got bad lines on my chest instead :(,39899,2
39900,IDK,39900,2
39901,very small size for xlarge.,39901,2
39901,Ok if you are a size 8.,39901,2
39902,"The color is way different, too dark.",39902,2
39902,Not what I was looking for.,39902,2
39903,Nothing like the picture.,39903,2
39903,"NOTHING>  It is shiny black, not long at all.",39903,2
39903,It truly is not a great shirt.,39903,2
39903,I would not recommend it.,39903,2
39904,I ordered a size larger than I usually wear but it was still too small,39904,2
39905,The delivery time and packaging were satisfactory.,39905,2
39905,One of the earrings fell apart when I first wore it --- kind of disappointing on that quality aspect...,39905,2
39906,"yes, too large but mostly I was sad to see it is mainly viscose so even though it said machine wash (but don't wring) it really recommended dry cleaning so was not practical.",39906,2
39907,Ok,39907,2
39908,outfit was good but hat was sized for a preemie,39908,2
39909,Beautiful watch.,39909,2
39909,But broke after about 3 weeks.,39909,2
39909,I managed to get it to work again after a light tap on a hard surface as a friend suggested.,39909,2
39909,This worked for about 2 months and now it's in the garbage because it stopped.,39909,2
39909,It's unfortunate because I really loved the look and feel of it.,39909,2
39909,"But, it is built so poorly that it's not worth it.",39909,2
39910,"I wanted to return this coat but it cost more to ship to China, so the manufaturers oftered me a $22 refund and I keep it.",39910,2
39910,I'll see if it fits any friend.,39910,2
39910,It is very warm so it's great to give to Goodwill,39910,2
39911,I really wanted to like it but I didn't like it because of the fit.,39911,2
39911,The top was not a good fit.,39911,2
39911,The bottom was too small.,39911,2
39912,I bought this dress for maternity pictures.,39912,2
39912,It was too short and fit funny.,39912,2
39912,Loved the color.,39912,2
39912,Wish it was longer...I ended up returning it.,39912,2
39913,"I order it because of reviews, but is not as pictured.",39913,2
39914,Tarnish doesn't last long,39914,2
39915,"I will admit my legs aren't the thinnest, but I was still pretty disappointed...",39915,2
39915,They got a large run going all the way down my right leg within the first 30 minutes of me wearing them.,39915,2
39915,I also ordered the bunny ones and they have the cat face and ears.,39915,2
39915,"I gave them to my friend, so I hope they fit her better.",39915,2
39916,"Worked fine until a run in the rain, hasn't worked since.",39916,2
39917,"It's a cool looking shirt, just runs way too small.",39917,2
39917,I had to return it.,39917,2
39918,My son loves these shoes because they are light weight and he learned how to tie his shoes on these.,39918,2
39918,I am disappointed in the quality.,39918,2
39918,Six weeks after buying them I am shopping for replacement shoes because these are falling apart.,39918,2
39918,"It's too late to return them, but too soon to need to replace them.",39918,2
39919,They were tight on my baby'shower legs,39919,2
39920,Color is very bright and not what I expected or what the picture shows.,39920,2
39921,Bought this earlier this year.,39921,2
39921,Didn't read the details that it's a two piece.,39921,2
39921,Too sheer of a fabrics to wear.,39921,2
39921,Looks like cut out fabrics but can't wear it outside without layer.,39921,2
39921,Wanted to return it but left it out in the room.,39921,2
39921,Read the description careful before purchase any clothes on amazon.,39921,2
39921,Either it's too sheer or too big of the size as it said it would be.,39921,2
39922,The fit is strangley large in the midsection but tight around legs and waist.,39922,2
39923,It is pretty... That's what the two stars are for.,39923,2
39923,I haven't opened the box yet and the diamond has already fell off somewhere between making it to shipping.,39923,2
39923,Now i have to go to the store and buy super glue to repair a new item,39923,2
39924,Not what I expected.,39924,2
39924,"The material looks ""cheap"".",39924,2
39924,Disappointing.,39924,2
39925,"ordered medium, got a small.",39925,2
39925,I received the one in grey last week and it was very short and the product was not what I was expecting at all.,39925,2
39926,What you see is not what you get.,39926,2
39926,It was really small and really cheap looking.,39926,2
39926,I returned it because it wasn't what I wanted for a nice dinner out.,39926,2
39927,"I was very excited to receive this product, unfortunetly it didn't give me any type of form to my body.",39927,2
39927,I am pretty flat with little hips and i was very excited to try it but there was no difference.,39927,2
39927,I ordered a large and it fit just a little snug.,39927,2
39928,Was pretty but I followed the harts and even got a size bigger and it's wayyyyyy too tight in the waste,39928,2
39929,Size too small,39929,2
39930,& fit nothing like the photo!,39930,2
39931,Very thin material!,39931,2
39931,Was not what I expected!,39931,2
39932,Not made for women with boobs bigger than a C-cup.,39932,2
39932,Got the biggest size and it hardly covered half of my DD's.,39932,2
39933,I did not order this statue.,39933,2
39933,It was a bracelet..,39933,2
39934,"I do like them as to the look of them, that's why I bought them.",39934,2
39934,"However, I am really unsatisfied how I have to constantly fix them from dangling and even had to bend the post to kind of help them stay in place.",39934,2
39935,"First, these are smaller than you might think.",39935,2
39935,"If you have small ears, they may be fine.",39935,2
39935,"Second, they arrived in a padded envelope and were broken.",39935,2
39935,"I can fix, so it's not worth returning to China, but ... really not a professional presentation.",39935,2
39935,Very disappointed after waiting so long.,39935,2
39936,Two stars because it's so cute & i love the size but it smells horrible.,39936,2
39936,I don't know how to get rid of the smell so I'm returning it.,39936,2
39937,The padding is too think and makes it look awkward.,39937,2
39938,In this picture it is definitely pink.,39938,2
39938,Not so in fact....it's orange.,39938,2
39938,"I do not like orange, peach, or salmon maybe, but not Orange.",39938,2
39938,"It is cut way shorter than the other Batwing dolman that I purchased, too short.",39938,2
39938,I'm sending it back to them.,39938,2
39939,I ordered girls size 5 they run very small!,39939,2
39939,Compares to 4T so disappointed when I received them.,39939,2
39940,It looks knitted in the picture and cool looking.,39940,2
39940,It's not; it's just colors on a thin wrap.,39940,2
39941,Not for me.,39941,2
39941,"I have a large bottom, didn't really lift.",39941,2
39942,This is a very low quality product.,39942,2
39942,The metal pin that holds the semicircular clasp is easily bent when you resize the bracelet.,39942,2
39942,I had to replace it with a slender spring bar in order to salvage the whole band.,39942,2
39942,"Also, the clasp depends on continued pressure from a bent, thin-metal tongue on the front of the clasp to stay shut.",39942,2
39942,This is almost certainly going to wear out over time.,39942,2
39942,"If you want quality, you have to pay for it I suppose.",39942,2
39943,Heavy on the bridge of my nose!,39943,2
39943,Leaves huge marks!,39943,2
39944,Too big.,39944,2
39944,Returned it.,39944,2
39945,Terrible Buy.,39945,2
39945,Awkward cut and fit.,39945,2
39946,I bought an XL and XXL both sizes are EXTREMLY small.,39946,2
39946,The color was nice and we're of nice quality for the price.,39946,2
39946,The sizing though is completely wrong.,39946,2
39947,Was to big,39947,2
39948,"I had a feeling this would be a gamble, but wow.",39948,2
39948,It looked even worse on me than I thought it would.,39948,2
39948,This thing is at least 3 sizes smaller than a normal dress.,39948,2
39948,"Also, There's a slit up the thigh that goes up WAY to high.",39948,2
39948,"And because it was so much smaller than expected, the skirt part looked more like a bath towel wrapped around me than a dress.",39948,2
39948,"If you are not a stick figure, or if you are larger than a size 6 - 8, you might want to rethink this one.",39948,2
39948,"It is a very cute dress, but fits crappily.",39948,2
39948,Will be returning it immediately.,39948,2
39949,Not the quality I was expecting.,39949,2
39949,The Jordan logo is turned when the shoestrings are put through the locks.,39949,2
39949,They're really not even close to the design or quality of the original Jordan 5 lace locks.,39949,2
39950,Not sure if this is meant to be for real children or toys.,39950,2
39950,Ridiculously small.,39950,2
39951,Seems like mine was from B-stock.,39951,2
39951,"The construction and materials are fine, but the buton was placed right at the edge of the leather, which makes snapping and unsnapping kind of awkward.",39951,2
39951,It also just barely fits around my belt.,39951,2
39951,"Given that I don't see anything like this on Amazon, I will probably keep it as it is still functional.",39951,2
39951,"But, I wish it looked more like the one in the picture.",39951,2
39952,"I hate to say it, but this is a disappointment.",39952,2
39952,They are very thin and I cannot wear these as you can see EVERYTHING through them.,39952,2
39952,"Only possible chance I have to wear this is to wear an actual dress or tunic over it, and even that is a gamble...",39952,2
39952,"They do fit, just very thin fabric....",39952,2
39952,I threw in an extra star because they are very pretty and I love the design...,39952,2
39952,"If only the fabric was less see through :( Oh well, live and learn.",39952,2
39953,All of the beads which were supposed to be purple were almost completely clear & void of any color on the bracelet I received.,39953,2
39954,order a size smaller than what you would think i ordered my size and feel like it stretched and wish i would have ordered a smaller size.,39954,2
39954,the material doesn't stay in place and i think if anything this is just good for posture.,39954,2
39955,Cute but super thin material.,39955,2
39955,Need to take it to the tailor to inquire if he can sew in a lining.,39955,2
39956,Received cup in the mail today and although cup colors and quality of cup is decent and as expected the boss writing on the cup on side was lop sided and cricked.,39956,2
39956,Disappointed in it not being aligned and professional looking.,39956,2
39957,"Runs very, very small, and I even ordered up... not flowy as pictured at all.",39957,2
39957,Skin tight spandex material.,39957,2
39958,"On top of being too small for a taller woman, the ""ties"" at the bottom aren't really ties.",39958,2
39959,"Very cute, bottoms and top interchanged with a solid black suit I own making them even cuter.",39959,2
39959,I had to order both size medium since it wouldn't let me chose different sizes.,39959,2
39959,"Bottoms fit good(I'm usually a medium) , top was too big (I am a 34C).",39959,2
39959,I had my boyfriend's mom alter the top to stay in place and not ride up and it definitely fit a lot better!,39959,2
39959,"After only the third time wearing the bottoms, unfortunately they ripped in the seem right under the butt!",39959,2
39959,"(WHILE I was wearing them, in the pool) I don't swim much, I lay out mostly and never jump in.",39959,2
39959,I stay where my feet touch and have very limited movement.,39959,2
39959,I was pretty much just standing and walking in the water and all the sudden they felt loose.,39959,2
39959,"I reached down to realize the seem had busted open, just hanging by each lining on both sides.",39959,2
39959,I can't say I'm angry or surprised since the bathing suits cost was lower than any one I'd find in stores.,39959,2
39959,But I did learn my lesson.,39959,2
39959,"This bathing suit is good for one or two wears with limited movement or maybe for a cute picture but be careful, especially when wearing it in public.",39959,2
39959,You may just give everyone a show...,39959,2
39960,Way smaller than pictured.,39960,2
39960,My niece will probably only use one season and outgrow it,39960,2
39961,"Poor quality, sized incorrectly.",39961,2
39961,Cheaply made.,39961,2
39962,I wore these at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe...I thought they would keep me dry.,39962,2
39962,Nope.,39962,2
39962,I was soaking wet.,39962,2
39962,"For what the reviews said, I thought I would be fine wearing them.",39962,2
39962,I was soaked through!,39962,2
39962,I was very disappointed with them.,39962,2
39962,"They fit ok, but if it says they are waterproof, they should be.",39962,2
39963,very bad warm!,39963,2
39964,it is wide and short.,39964,2
39964,Stiff material.,39964,2
39964,Might get softer with wash.,39964,2
39965,The latex top is not very comfortable around you middle,39965,2
39966,The item fit well but the description said teal and its is NOT teal.,39966,2
39966,It's very much turquoise.,39966,2
39966,I was not happy because I wanted teal so I returned it.,39966,2
39967,You get what you pay for,39967,2
39968,It's hard to find XL t-shirt that doesn't shrink to a Medium- Large.,39968,2
39968,The shirts I puchased fell in this category.,39968,2
39968,"It wasn't a total loss, I gave them to my son.",39968,2
39969,I got the 3/4 in plus (I wear more of a 2) and they were still super tight around my thighs.,39969,2
39970,the wool seems cheap,39970,2
39971,"Fits very well, fabric not good quality, too thin can be seen through.",39971,2
39971,"I returned it, did no like quality for that price.",39971,2
39972,Too small.,39972,2
39972,I bought a medium and it fit like a small,39972,2
39973,This belt is NOT white.,39973,2
39973,It's off white/cream.,39973,2
39973,Other than that it's a decent belt.,39973,2
39973,But was very disappointed that it was not white as pictured!,39973,2
39974,The craftsmanship isn't great.,39974,2
39974,I was expecting it to fit like the photo since I have the body make.,39974,2
39974,It's short and yet big.,39974,2
39974,So it just looked weird on me.,39974,2
39974,I'm 5'7,39974,2
39975,"Applique was crooked and faded, shirt runs on small side.",39975,2
39975,Shipping updates were erratic,39975,2
39976,Fell appart,39976,2
39977,The metal on this changed colors very quickly.,39977,2
39977,Not the best quality.,39977,2
39977,But not bad for the price.,39977,2
39978,Shrinkage with washing also,39978,2
39979,low quality.,39979,2
39980,SO SMALL.,39980,2
39980,BUNCHES UP.,39980,2
39981,They are definitely beautiful.,39981,2
39981,But my jewels are already coming off and I've barely even taken them out of the package.,39981,2
39981,One jewel was just already missing.,39981,2
39981,No where to be found in any of the packaging but you could definitely see the spot it was missing from.,39981,2
39981,I will still wear them but I was expecting better quality.,39981,2
39982,They fit as expected but they feel gross.,39982,2
39982,I workout and have lost of workout clothes these are for funky not good for working out whatsoever.,39982,2
39983,Im 5-5 dress went to my knees.,39983,2
39983,"Also great fit on top, just tight on bottom.",39983,2
39984,Runs super  small and material looks like rayon..,39984,2
39985,It looks very cheap.,39985,2
39985,Worse than the picture.,39985,2
39985,I will not wear it.,39985,2
39986,This dress is nothing like the picture.,39986,2
39986,First IT IS NOT white and it DOES NOT SHAPE like the picture.,39986,2
39986,I thought it would have some mesh or stiff lining underneath to hold it out but it doesnt.,39986,2
39986,"It falls flat, the sticth at the waist with the underneath lining and the lace does not even up.",39986,2
39986,"Also, the end of the sleeves and hemming of the dress isn't stitch so it unravels.",39986,2
39986,This dress also has an unpleasant factory odor.,39986,2
39986,The lenght is good and it came quicker then expected.,39986,2
39986,I only kept it because I can wear a jacket over it for church.,39986,2
39987,Bigger than expected - no form - too floppy!,39987,2
39988,Size chart was misleading.,39988,2
39988,I would suggest going up in size.,39988,2
39988,(If the size chart says your size would be a small- go with medium) Material was soft.,39988,2
39989,i won't wear this.,39989,2
39989,the clasp is not functional.,39989,2
39990,Did not fit my ear lobe,39990,2
39991,WAY too small....,39991,2
39992,One broke the first time I used it.,39992,2
39993,"This product is not only too small, it is absurdly too small, e.g.",39993,2
39993,I've a 32 inch waist and am in very good shape so the size chart indicated a size large for my measurements.,39993,2
39993,"Given this, I ordered a large but this corset would have to be a 2-3X to come close .",39993,2
39993,"Additionally and although the vendor offered a full refund if I returned the corset,  postage to China is as much as I paid for the item.",39993,2
39993,"Now I must find a very, very small friend to which to donate the corset!",39993,2
39993,"So do yourself a favor, Go Prime all the time; I've learned my lesson.",39993,2
39994,The gold is not very nice and the blue back ground is glitter!!!,39994,2
39994,!,39994,2
39995,It was very thin and cheaply made..broke the first day.,39995,2
39996,"Not soft at all... its cute, but rough.",39996,2
39997,The padding is weird and loose.,39997,2
39997,The torso is ridculos short and the back is way higher than the one in the picture.,39997,2
39997,"The quality is OK I guess, but I'm not happy at all!",39997,2
39998,The two shirts have different qualities.,39998,2
39998,"Ok product, doesn't look too fancy.",39998,2
39998,Wouldn't buy it again.,39998,2
39999,Snaps are full of nickel.,39999,2
39999,"Leather, if you will, is low grade and already stretching.",39999,2
39999,They did not claim to be nickel free.,39999,2
39999,Just a hope.,39999,2
40000,"I have farely small legs, they would pinch my legs at the top and then would slide down.",40000,2
40000,Do not buy.,40000,2
40001,"fits too small, & material is very poor quality.",40001,2
40002,So fragile broke in 2 pieces the 2nd day,40002,2
40003,Couldn't get it over my shoulders and I went two sizes up.,40003,2
40003,This is meant for short people.,40003,2
40003,"I am 5'7"" 150lb",40003,2
40004,"Nice shirt, but we did not expect it to be so large.",40004,2
40005,Doesn't stretch at all.,40005,2
40006,Its a good top however it runs small and it doesn't stretch as much,40006,2
40007,Size on belt says 48 but full length is about 42.,40007,2
40007,I can only use the first 2 to 3 clicks before it gets too tight.,40007,2
40007,I bought another belt earlier that was supposed to be a 42-48 and it was stamped 50.,40007,2
40007,This one fits well.,40007,2
40007,I guess you have to order and hopefully get the size you really need.,40007,2
40008,the picture shows them a few inches  above the knee but they are shorter than that and too short for my mother in law who I got them for.,40008,2
40009,"as other reviewer stated, the waist band has basically no elastic and it's like trying to pull closed jeans over the baby's hips each time you take them on and off.",40009,2
40009,Not comfortable for the baby.,40009,2
40009,But cute design if they could make it more wearable.,40009,2
40010,"Large bag, fits a lot but it was just too big to carry.",40010,2
40010,This would be a great bag for someone with a large family who wants to stack beach towels in here.,40010,2
40010,Othewise it is easy to overpack and then it becomes extremely heavy.,40010,2
40010,I ended up returning it.,40010,2
40011,These are extremely small.,40011,2
40011,I wear a size 4 and bought a large because the reviews stated they run small.,40011,2
40011,That is definitely an understatement.,40011,2
40011,They seem to be child size.,40011,2
40011,I do not recommend unless the buyer is very thin/small.,40011,2
40012,awkward fit for lanky kid,40012,2
40013,maybe i just 2 BIG,40013,2
40014,I purchase this item in memoriam to the late David Bowie however I was very disappointed once it arrived the fabric is very very thin very close to t-shirt material actually there is no soft fleece inside it feels just like the same cloth that is on the outside which doesn't feel nice against the skin although the photo or screen print rather looks very nice the item is made from very cheap fabric and the quality is very poor it shrunk almost a full size upon washing and to be honest I'm really not seeing myself wearing it very much but it's too much of a hassle to return I wouldn't recommend buying them,40014,2
40015,"3x fit on the bottom but top fits someone who has an A maybe a B cup , definitely doesn't fit D cup",40015,2
40016,"Way thinner/smaller than it looked, definitely not ""warm"", tracking was a mess, but it did arrive on time.",40016,2
40016,You get what you pay for I suppose.,40016,2
40017,"Nice heavy watch, keeps great time.",40017,2
40017,"Watch crown cap came off when I unscrewed it though, I was able to fix it.",40017,2
40018,"These are so large, I bought looking at the waist size.",40018,2
40018,Totally too big.,40018,2
40019,Pretty style but it runs very small.,40019,2
40020,was great for a while until my zipper broke.,40020,2
40020,I currently just bought a new back pack from Target.,40020,2
40021,Run too small.,40021,2
40021,Won't purchase Again.,40021,2
40022,it too tight .,40022,2
40022,especially where the credits slots.,40022,2
40022,the material is too stiff for me.,40022,2
40023,"This top ran small - I normally wear an XL or XXL, and I ordered a XXXL, and it fit like an XL that ran on the small side.",40023,2
40023,"The fabric is soft, but it's very thin, so you'll need to wear something underneath it.",40023,2
40023,I forgot to return it and now it's too late - I'll find a tiny friend to pass it on to.,40023,2
40024,Cute but tooooooo small.returned,40024,2
40025,way to small,40025,2
40026,too small and could not return it,40026,2
40027,"I always wear a small, wore a small all throughout my pregnancy, this was tiny, had to return",40027,2
40028,Size chart is SO far off.,40028,2
40028,"Order one size up, no more.",40028,2
40028,I ordered 2 sizes up based on reviews and it's a muumuu on me.,40028,2
40029,Smaller than expected not worth the price,40029,2
40030,Way too big,40030,2
40031,sizing is very small,40031,2
40032,"I'm 5'10"" and had to wear shorts with gown it was more like a long shirt that barely covered my bum , the design and colors were pretty though .",40032,2
40033,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture.,40033,2
40033,Super tight at the bottom and short up to my private area instead as a dress.,40033,2
40033,"I'm usually a medium and ordered myself a large (I'm pregnant), and the material/fabric was so see-thru and cheap.",40033,2
40033,- Ill write another review once I lose all the baby weight to see how it'll look then in a few months..,40033,2
40034,Didn't like it.,40034,2
40034,"Kind of fits weird, like the straps don't lay flat.",40034,2
40034,And the top is constantly falling down because there's no way to adjust the straps.,40034,2
40034,"Ironically, I bought this for river tubing and surfing because I thought it looked sturdy and that it wouldn't fall down!",40034,2
40034,Kind of wishing I hadn't bought it :/,40034,2
40035,They do not fit my ear correctly,40035,2
40036,Sadly this bag is already falling apart after 1 month.,40036,2
40036,The stitching is coming undone.,40036,2
40036,I got this as a gift and can't return.,40036,2
40037,"If you are size small but have larger than C cup size this may not fit you, just a heads up!",40037,2
40037,Other than that it is what I was expecting.,40037,2
40038,"very small, disappointed.",40038,2
40038,Gave it to someone with small build,40038,2
40039,Very pretty.,40039,2
40039,Broke easily.,40039,2
40040,Good cover of the body but it's a blanket poncho!,40040,2
40041,"The back of the dress was super sexy on, however, the material is wayyy too thin across the stomach.",40041,2
40041,"I am 5' 4'', 160 lb, with a 29"" waist, and 34"" hips and ordered the large.",40041,2
40041,The dress fit perfect but the material was not as expected.,40041,2
40041,I like to think that my waist is pretty slim compared to all of my weight being carried in my butt and hips.,40041,2
40041,"However, if you normally get bloated after a meal then this dress is not for you.",40041,2
40041,This dress is not cotton so it clings to every little bloat and roll.,40041,2
40041,Would definitely keep the dress if the material was cotton.,40041,2
40041,If you are pencil thin then this dress would work.,40041,2
40042,I got a small.,40042,2
40042,It was awfully made.,40042,2
40042,The fabric is crappy and the bust was way to big and just looked weird.,40042,2
40042,There was extra fabric in the bust area that made it look weird.,40042,2
40042,I tossed this in the garbage.,40042,2
40043,"Nice accessory piece, but the fabric sticks to EVERYTHING.",40043,2
40044,The barbells are ok quality as far as how they look.,40044,2
40044,"I didn't have any issues as far as any color chipping off of them, however the barbell leaves a terrible taste in my mouth, almost like copper/pennies.",40044,2
40044,And it also caused some irritation.,40044,2
40044,"This may just be personal sensitivity, but overall I'm not really impressed with this product and I don't recommend it.",40044,2
40045,I returned this because it was kinda itchy and was way more Grandma than it looks in the picture.,40045,2
40045,The straps were like 3 inches thick,40045,2
40046,"I love the dress, but your sizes doesn't coordinate with actual sizes.",40046,2
40046,"It says 3x, but it's actually not a size 3x (18-20)",40046,2
40047,Didn't realize it was coming directly from China.,40047,2
40047,Cheap looking.,40047,2
40048,"Other reviewers claimed this runs small, but they must either be crazy or have received a different product than I did.",40048,2
40048,It is much too large and literally fell off my body when I tried it on because the opening is so big.,40048,2
40048,"I sewed a band across the back to hold it together and on, but it still isn't really wearable.",40048,2
40048,"Disappointing, because it has the potential to be cute.",40048,2
40048,The quality is also not what I'd hoped.,40048,2
40048,It had a few loose seams and one of the bits of stitching hadn't been trimmed so there was a huge wad of extra knotted up thread attached to one of the shoulders.,40048,2
40049,This was larger than expected.,40049,2
40049,The zipper was hard to zip when the wallet was empty.,40049,2
40049,The zipper was ever harder to open and close with my items inside the wallet..,40049,2
40050,"it fit my twelve year old granddaughter ok - but since she has a bust, she'll have to wear a T shirt underneath and keep the top buttons unbuttoned.",40050,2
40050,Had to shorten it for her.,40050,2
40050,Cute dress.,40050,2
40050,Wrong sizing.,40050,2
40051,The pattern described was not at all like on the photo.,40051,2
40051,The slit is on the side and really high up!,40051,2
40051,"It is very long, and the slip that is underneath is not long enough.",40051,2
40051,It was really cheesy and flimsy.,40051,2
40051,Plan on returning it.,40051,2
40052,runs very small.,40052,2
40052,couldn't even get it on.,40052,2
40052,I had to put in the poor box,40052,2
40053,"It is a bit small for me, it's not as neat as it looks in the photo, not worth returning, and will probably wear it sometimes",40053,2
40054,LONG!!!!!,40054,2
40054,Looks like such a cute length but the medium was like a tent!,40054,2
40054,Order a size smaller for sure.,40054,2
40055,Runs smaller that description and see through.,40055,2
40056,i should have paid more attention to the photos.,40056,2
40056,the girl in the picture shows a full bottom but the actual garment picture shows a thong.,40056,2
40056,its a thong.,40056,2
40056,i cant wear this dress out.,40056,2
40056,plus i ordered the medium.,40056,2
40056,"i am 5""6 130lbs.",40056,2
40056,if i were to wear this i would have to get it taken in at least an inch on eash side.,40056,2
40056,"and as for the sheer part,  i have to get that hemmed.",40056,2
40056,even in 6 inch heels there is extra material dragging on the floor.,40056,2
40056,gave it 2 stars because i can wear it for my guy as a sexy outfit for an in-house date night.,40056,2
40056,thats about it.,40056,2
40057,One size fits all did not fit me.,40057,2
40057,"A little to snug and long for my liking (i'm 4'11') and the material is shiny, which I did not like.",40057,2
40058,Concept is good.,40058,2
40058,Plastic boards are best thing about this bag.,40058,2
40058,Zippers are cheap and it is not put together well at all.,40058,2
40058,Didn't expect much for the price but should have lasted for at least one business trip.,40058,2
40059,Shorter than expected.,40059,2
40060,looks and feels cheap,40060,2
40061,"Not a good value
 Not stichedvwell off centered and didn't want to snap shut with cigarette inside:'(
Dissatisfied and disappointed  specially for the price
Not a good purchase",40061,2
40062,It comes very small.,40062,2
40062,Get a size bigger.,40062,2
40062,No padding either.,40062,2
40063,"Color was reddish orange, and the tail is awkwardly small.",40063,2
40063,The ears are a little tight on the head and should be pointier.,40063,2
40063,I got asked if I was a tiger a lot.,40063,2
40064,Runs very small!,40064,2
40065,It look a little worn not what I expected ....a little cheaply made......was t happy with this product.,40065,2
40066,no,40066,2
40067,Hard to put together,40067,2
40068,not really my style.,40068,2
40069,not great quality.,40069,2
40069,pretty thin.,40069,2
40070,I think this is mislabeled and is really a large shirt.,40070,2
40071,"Pretty short in front,oddly long On just sides",40071,2
40072,Definitely too small & not heavy weight at all..more for summer temperatures,40072,2
40073,Purse started to fall apart after a week.,40073,2
40073,I like the size and color just poorly made.,40073,2
40074,Loved it,40074,2
40075,The product is cute.,40075,2
40075,"And before it got cold, it was a great way for my daughter to not lose her gloves.",40075,2
40075,"Once it got super cold, and only after about a week, the clip busted and shattered.",40075,2
40076,No adjustable straps and to short.,40076,2
40076,"If you don't want a refund, and do not want to buy another, you can make is a normal, and regular slip, buy an elastic strap probably from Walmart or anywhere and you can cut the top and sew it.",40076,2
40077,Couldn't go in :(,40077,2
40078,"Size is smaller than anticipated, not american sizing.",40078,2
40079,The opening at the top is way too small for the size of bag.,40079,2
40079,The rings and clips to attach the strap to the bag are plastic.,40079,2
40079,"I'll keep the bag and use it for a travel toiletry bag, but it's not good enough quality to use for a regular purse.",40079,2
40080,The strap is made cheap the snap is hard to unsnap..,40080,2
40081,Super Small.,40081,2
40081,Size not as advertised.,40081,2
40082,The shirt fit but the neck was too tight.,40082,2
40082,Also the shirt was thin.,40082,2
40083,What too small for me,40083,2
40084,Definitely not worth the price.,40084,2
40084,Smaller than expected.,40084,2
40084,Would not buy again.,40084,2
40085,The dress is beautiful.,40085,2
40085,"Unfortunately, the second time my daughter tried the dress on, the zipper broke.",40085,2
40085,Now I have to pay a seamstress to fix the zipper!,40085,2
40086,Ordered this in a 0-3 month size and it's too big for my 2 year old.,40086,2
40086,Can't complain too much because it was a fairly cheap purchase but the sizes are ridiculously off.,40086,2
40087,Not a good surf watch as suggested in the questions section.,40087,2
40087,Bought one to use for surfing and it went out after a couple months.,40087,2
40087,I ordered another one because they're so cheap and it stopped working after a couple months.,40087,2
40087,You can't beat the price for this watch but I wouldn't suggest it for regular water activities.,40087,2
40088,"I bought this dress on Amazon thinking it would
Be PERFECT for the Red Dress run.",40088,2
40088,"It was lightweight and cheap, but also super adorable.",40088,2
40088,I put it on and realized how short it was.,40088,2
40088,I'm talking barely covering the bum short.,40088,2
40088,"If you have a Long Torso, this will not be for you.",40088,2
40088,It's more of a tunic.,40088,2
40088,It runs slightly smaller than expected.,40088,2
40088,"I'm still going to wear it for the run, just wear yoga pants underneath.",40088,2
40089,I thought it would look like sand and star fish but it really looks like a printed picture and not to bright.,40089,2
40090,"I have to say, the quality of this romper (the blue romper with the floral pattern) was actually pretty nice considering the price, but the sizing is just way too small.",40090,2
40090,"For reference, I'm 5'7"", 145 lbs, 36DD, but with narrow hips and not too much butt and this was so tiny.",40090,2
40090,"If you are thin and not too tall, this would probably work well, but I had to send it back.",40090,2
40091,The sizing is wrong.,40091,2
40091,I'm a 28 waist and the 29 (XS) is far too righy.. Order a size or two up.,40091,2
40091,Will be returning,40091,2
40092,The glasses are pretty good for the price (I have several pairs in different colors).,40092,2
40092,My problem is that the orange doesn't match the color in the photo.,40092,2
40092,The glasses I got were a neon orange and I pretty sure the color changes in sunlight and gets almost a little pink as I wear them throughout the day.,40092,2
40093,Pretty dress but fit a little too snug for my taste.,40093,2
40093,"I'm 5' 6"", weigh about 165, and measure 39-33-41 and ordered a extra large... Too bad, it was cute...",40093,2
40094,"Pros:
Beautiful details
It looked lovely in the front and it was not that small.",40094,2
40094,"It came in a thoughtful package that when i saw it it actually made me smile

Cons:
Though i wished to leave 3 stars because of the thoughtful packaging, the product itself came broken already
the parts are so small i was lucky  to see where it fell from the hole the sword tip made in the bag because i have kittens and it could of been a choking hazard
I was a bit sad because I was going to give it to my husband as a birthday gift  next weekend",40094,2
40095,"The skirt is so cute, but it was way too small for me.",40095,2
40095,:(,40095,2
40096,you could see my nipples through this suit- wasn't what I expected,40096,2
40097,"Sizes are not accurate, nothing was labeled.",40097,2
40097,Very pretty but poor quality.,40097,2
40098,Way to big.,40098,2
40098,Wasn't very cute on me.,40098,2
40099,It's different than the photo you published.,40099,2
40099,I mean the size.,40099,2
40099,In the photo it's big than you can see it....,40099,2
40100,"Top Heavy Design, so the charm hangs upside down on a necklace.",40100,2
40100,I suppose it would work fine on a bracelet?,40100,2
40100,"The 2 pieces are also slightly magnetic, but opposite poles so that they repel each other a bit - strange",40100,2
40101,"Two stars for the design only, which is a copy of the Athena brand swimsuit.",40101,2
40101,The suit was very cheaply made and the sizing was not accurately described.,40101,2
40101,I ordered an XL (not 2XL) as the one I got previously in L was more of a China size- way to small.,40101,2
40101,When I received the order it said 2XL!!,40101,2
40101,I did not want a 2XL.,40101,2
40101,The XL straps were way to long and there is no support for the bust.,40101,2
40101,The material is very very cheaply made and the suit is poorly constructed.,40101,2
40101,It is a cheap imitation.,40101,2
40101,Beware of the way too positive reviews.,40101,2
40101,I don't know why others gave this suit such high reviews.,40101,2
40102,Good idea but the tips are extremely soft and bend easily.,40102,2
40102,Broke after the first use.,40102,2
40102,Returned for refund.,40102,2
40103,Cheap material n runs very small sizes,40103,2
40104,"I specifictly ordered a L because of the people saying it was somewhat small, but this is CLEARLY not a L. I'm sorry but I'm 5'8'' and I weight 150 pounds ALL my clothes are medium.",40104,2
40104,This is tighter then anything from my closet and the sleeves are so short I can't even put my thumbs through the holes.,40104,2
40105,These fit as I thought they would.,40105,2
40105,I just do not like the fact that my son can unzip them and take them off.,40105,2
40105,They need a snap at the top like carters.,40105,2
40105,They could also use some elastic on the ankles too.,40105,2
40106,The ring is very cute.,40106,2
40106,But the metal is extremely weak.,40106,2
40106,I will say that it is real sterling silver.,40106,2
40106,It hasn't turned green or tarnished at all.,40106,2
40106,But it bent almost immediately.,40106,2
40106,"You can't tell once you wear it, but the ring is all warped.",40106,2
40107,The wings are beautiful.,40107,2
40107,"Sadly, when I tried them on for the first time, the elastic you put your finger in ripped the edge of the wing off.",40107,2
40107,They really should have some sort of reinforcement there so it doesn't rip so easily.,40107,2
40107,"I kind of fixed it, but for Halloween, I will have to be super careful every time I move that arm.",40107,2
40108,This thing is way too big.,40108,2
40108,And I have a large hat size to begin with,40108,2
40109,The piece is nice.. Not worth what i paid for though.,40109,2
40109,At all!!,40109,2
40109,Could find cheaper,40109,2
40110,fit so akwardly and looked nothing like the picture,40110,2
40111,The sleeves were way too long and really bell shaped at the end,40111,2
40112,Just OK,40112,2
40113,not like photo,40113,2
40114,This is a shirt and not a cover up.,40114,2
40114,I like it still but barely covers past the belly button.,40114,2
40114,A little disappointed,40114,2
40115,"Not impressed, looks cheap, does not fit very well, picture is much better than actual product.",40115,2
40115,I returned it.,40115,2
40116,"I love the print, which is the main reason I bought it, but the hip fit is odd, and it hangs like a bag.",40116,2
40116,Not happy with the weird old lady cut.,40116,2
40117,The way it is presented in picture is VERY MISLEADING.,40117,2
40117,Looks to come with the chain and shows up WITHOUT.,40117,2
40118,"I bought an XS and the bottom was super wide (much more than a slight flare) so it looked really weird, unlike in the photo.",40118,2
40119,Should have trusted the other reviews.,40119,2
40119,Idk what I'm going to do with this bag.,40119,2
40119,"Probably won't return it,  but I probably won't use it.",40119,2
40119,It's way too big and cheap looking.,40119,2
40120,Very cheap looking runs small,40120,2
40121,Ordered 3.,40121,2
40121,"They're OK, not as nice and flowing as the pictures indicate and the trimming they use on the thin chiffon is very heavy - looks like edging for a rug, they are really ugly.",40121,2
40121,I'm returning 2 of them that are too small in the arms.,40121,2
40121,"I'll keep the one that fits and cut off the heavy, heavy trimming they used on it.",40121,2
40121,It will be OK with jeans.,40121,2
40121,"They were cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for.",40121,2
40122,not warm at all and after using the bow came out,40122,2
40123,I brought a medium because I usually wear a small but I think these are little girls clothes because I could fit the arms and it's wayy to short.,40123,2
40123,Worst material ever so I just end up just wear it as swimsuit cover.,40123,2
40124,The material does not appear to be very sturdy and I have decided to order a leather product instead.,40124,2
40125,I ordered a XXXL it is more like a XXL.,40125,2
40126,Very short - you need to be a size 0-2 to look like the picture,40126,2
40127,Doesn't look remotely like picture.,40127,2
40127,"Cheap material, different shade of blue, ill-fitting.",40127,2
40127,Blah.,40127,2
40128,"Way too small, tried to stretch the toes out and so far no Bueno because the material is faux leatherette suede not real suede so it doesn't have any give to it.",40128,2
40128,"Buying shoes online is always such a crap shoot, this time it was more crap.",40128,2
40129,It feels almost costumy or pj like id probably use it for halloween,40129,2
40130,"I tried to listen to everyone on how it runs small, but it's seriously so small, if you have boobs, don't get it.",40130,2
40130,"I'm a 36 D and it I definitely should have ordered a larger size, but I still don't think it would look right with bigger boobs.",40130,2
40130,This is meant for someone with an A or a B cup,40130,2
40131,Feels like it will tear and the thread of the pants won't last long..,40131,2
40132,"Cheap shirt, the inside is itching my body...doesnt even look like the picture...the eagle is plain black and the shirt is bright red.",40132,2
40132,The reason why i bought is because in the picture looks stylish.,40132,2
40132,Im returning it,40132,2
40133,It sticks to your skin and makes you feel sticky and sweaty even when the weather is cool.,40133,2
40133,"But it's pretty, if you don't mind feeling sticky and sweaty.",40133,2
40133,And the arms ar very very tight.,40133,2
40134,"They are cute and great quality but they roll like crazy, it's annoying..I have chicken legs and they squeeze my thigh fat then roll down to my knees..you would literally have to have hockey sticks for legs to wear these",40134,2
40135,I am not a reviewer per se but I do read a lot of reviews before buying.,40135,2
40135,The color description on this blouse was orange.,40135,2
40135,When the blouse arrived it was close to a copper color but very pretty.,40135,2
40135,I loved the fabric but then I noticed that the right sleeve was not sewn.,40135,2
40135,So I sent the blouse back and reordered.,40135,2
40135,"The replacement blouse came and the color is peach, the fabric is not the same as the first blouse and the color ran a little in the back (somewhat like a water spot)..",40135,2
40135,I am keeping this blouse as it will be useable with jeans.,40135,2
40135,I failed to notice that this blouse was coming from China and there is hardly any consistency with quality on products from China.,40135,2
40135,I will be more alert on where the item is coming from in the future.,40135,2
40136,way too long but fits well,40136,2
40137,The first thing that happened when I took this out of its plastic bag is that the teeth on the front pocket zipper were not lined up.,40137,2
40137,Going to send it back.,40137,2
40138,I like the necklaces but they tarnish easily.,40138,2
40139,"Seems nice, but not even close to the right size.",40139,2
40139,I ordered the 14 inch and it is way too big.,40139,2
40140,the stitching comes apart easy and the stuffing comes,40140,2
40141,Not so much.,40141,2
40141,I suppose you get what you pay for.,40141,2
40142,Too heavy.,40142,2
40142,"I couldn't even claim the product because, considering the weight, the shipping costs all the way to my country were humongously high!",40142,2
40142,Double the price of the shoe.,40142,2
40142,So I lost my money buying this shoe.,40142,2
40143,Sweater was not as expected.,40143,2
40143,Very thin and see through - apparently I did not pay enough attention to what I was ordering.,40143,2
40143,I ended up giving it away.,40143,2
40144,I didn't know that this jacket was cropped.,40144,2
40144,It doesn't look cropped in the photo.,40144,2
40144,"I don't like it cropped, I want to return.",40144,2
40144,It fits nice though.,40144,2
40145,It's form fitting not loose and flowy like a maxi dress should be,40145,2
40146,Here's the deal: I have two other EazyBelts that I like a lot.,40146,2
40146,But this one arrived with the plate on the front broken off the belt.,40146,2
40146,"It's cosmetic, but without it, the belt looks...well...exactly what it is - broken.",40146,2
40146,So my problem with this one is the buckle.,40146,2
40146,"A quick look inside the box before shipping would have revealed the broken belt, so it bugs me that it was even shipped out in that condition, (this did NOT happen in shipping - it's just a poorly constructed facade on the buckle).",40146,2
40146,"Also, I didn't notice it when I ordered it, but this belt has no loop past the belt to corral the excess belt.",40146,2
40146,That's no good.,40146,2
40146,My other EazyBelts have one.,40146,2
40146,My advice: Buy an EazyBelt...but steer well clear of this particular buckle style.,40146,2
40146,A poorly constructed front piece and the lack of a post-buckle loop makes this belt a poor value and poor fashion choice.,40146,2
40147,Love the vest hate that it wasn't even close to fitting.,40147,2
40147,It can't be right.,40147,2
40147,"We are all thin and average bone size but this large vest only fits the female who is 5'8"" in our home.",40147,2
40147,I can't see an extra large even fitting my other medium sized daughter.,40147,2
40147,Would buy two more of these vests if they fit.,40147,2
40147,But not worth trying-that's how off the sizing was.,40147,2
40148,"Don't waste your money, it didn't even fit my butt",40148,2
40149,Glasses came broken.,40149,2
40149,They have a very cheap feel to them.,40149,2
40150,"Not great quality, but I guess you get what you pay for.",40150,2
40151,Only worn them Twice and A Lens fell off.,40151,2
40151,I don't know where but yeah you get what you pay for.,40151,2
40152,none,40152,2
40153,I BOUGHT MY WIFE ONE 2 YEARS AGO IT WORKED GREAT UNTILL THE BUTTON FOR THE MODE CONTROL FELL OUT.,40153,2
40153,"WELL IT GETS ALL FOGED UP INSIDE AND YOU CAN NOT READ IT, OK IF YOU DONT MIND TRASHING IT AND BUYING A NEW ONE EVERY 2 YEARS.",40153,2
40154,Was not fond of the style....looked more like a maturity top,40154,2
40155,As soon as you put these hose on you will find little breaks in the material.,40155,2
40155,However it's interesting that they don't all form runs (although one run is all it takes).,40155,2
40155,They are super hard to manipulate once on the body.,40155,2
40155,One would think that over the years Legg's would figure out how to make a decent pair of panty hose.,40155,2
40156,Definitely not a maternity skirt or a plus size.,40156,2
40156,"I ordered a XXL and it fits like an XL, which will be fine for after the baby.",40156,2
40156,It's a cute non-maternity skirt so I am giving two stars.,40156,2
40156,I am pretty disappointed.,40156,2
40157,The dress ran very small & I was disappointed  because I really liked the dress.,40157,2
40158,Better quality than I was expecting.,40158,2
40158,The clasp broke after wearing it a couple times and some of the jewels came loose.,40158,2
40159,I expected a cotton feel to these as they were only 5% other material (spandex).,40159,2
40159,They are very stretchey and confining.,40159,2
40159,If you are looking for cotton underwear only go with 100%.,40159,2
40159,Disappointed as they were marketed very good as breathable.,40159,2
40160,This skirt is so disproportionately long.,40160,2
40160,It's doesn't drape elegantly and has no hopes of looking nice in any capacity.,40160,2
40160,The color is so awful.,40160,2
40160,"It looks like a nice rich brown and taupe, but in reality it has major yellow undertones.",40160,2
40160,I got rid of mine immediately.,40160,2
40161,Unfortunately the infinity necklaces that I received did not have directioner on them.,40161,2
40162,bag scratched and not shipped in original packaging,40162,2
40163,It is a cute top with a cute concept.,40163,2
40163,The material is ok and should last a few washes.,40163,2
40163,I am unhappy with the sizing-I ordered a 12/14 US and received an 3XL which is HUGE!,40163,2
40163,Probably will only be able to wear it during the final stages.,40163,2
40164,It's OK.,40164,2
40164,The fit is so cute - so I wish it served it's intended purpose as a nursing dress.,40164,2
40164,The fabric at the top does not have enough elasticity to it to comfortably nurse.,40164,2
40165,This item was returned.,40165,2
40166,Exactly what I was concerned they would be.,40166,2
40166,"I wear a size 13 shoe, sometimes a 12.",40166,2
40166,These are so tight the leave a severe ring at the top of the ankle.,40166,2
40166,Plus the are very difficult to get on or off.,40166,2
40166,This has become a problem for me over the past several years.,40166,2
40166,All the manufacturers have cut back on the size and thickness of the material.,40166,2
40166,Will give them to a nephew who wears an actual size 11.,40166,2
40166,God help the guy who wears a size 14 shoe.,40166,2
40167,"There are no matched sets at all, and the price is higher two days after I ordered them, so even if I were inclined to buy a second set, raising the price for something that - according to another reviewer - is likely to break right away anyway is irritating.",40167,2
40167,I am not remotely inclined to buy a second pair just so that I can wear matching sets.,40167,2
40168,bad quality,40168,2
40169,Nice wallet.,40169,2
40169,It does nlot block RFID.,40169,2
40169,I can scan my work ID while it is in this wallet and the wallet is closed.,40169,2
40170,I was extremely disappointed when I received this bracelet.,40170,2
40170,"Not only does it look like it came from a gumball machine, you can NOT read what it says at all, half the letters were missing.",40170,2
40171,buy the size up!,40171,2
40172,"Be careful - this set is really cute and soft, but it came with a really weird smell that it was hard to get out and it's difficult to wash.",40172,2
40172,"I managed with Febreze, but it still smells faintly weird.",40172,2
40173,TOO Heavy,40173,2
40174,I ordered a size bigger and when I put it on I could barely move in it,40174,2
40175,"Really small, if you are a size 10 these will not fit you",40175,2
40176,Shirt did arrive 2 weeks earlier than expected.,40176,2
40176,It's shorter than expected and the picture is not centered on the shirt.,40176,2
40176,Not that great quality either.,40176,2
40176,Really disappointed because I really wanted this shirt and now I don't.,40176,2
40177,Sizing runs VERY small!,40177,2
40177,"This product is no where near the size it says it is, and I even bought a size larger than I take anticipating for sizing to run small.",40177,2
40177,It wouldn't even fit my 11 year old daughter who is an average size for an 11 year old.,40177,2
40177,If it were sized properly it would most likely be a small-medium....not the labeled 3x.,40177,2
40178,"The size actually fit well, but the fit made me look like a whale!",40178,2
40178,It went back!,40178,2
40179,SMALLER THAN REGULAR SIZE,40179,2
40180,This was not at all flattering on me.,40180,2
40180,"The material isn't cotton like I thought it would be, its polyester and therefore I looked like a luchador without a mask smh.",40180,2
40180,Maybe someone else could make this work but for me it was a no-go.,40180,2
40181,Fits very small!!!!,40181,2
40181,Should be very careful when ordering clothing on Amazon.,40181,2
40182,It's beautiful but it broke as I was putting it on for the first time.,40182,2
40183,This product was WAY too small even though I specifically purchased PLUS SIZE (2-XL) thinking these would actually be too big on me (which I can deal with) but they were way too small.,40183,2
40183,Then upon researching this product realized they were from China.,40183,2
40183,Go figure.,40183,2
40184,Sleeves much too long; tight across upper body-disappointed.,40184,2
40185,I like the shape and how it functions.,40185,2
40185,But it arrived full of dust (that I assume was from manufacturing process) and smelled strongly.,40185,2
40185,I'm still trying to get the smell out.,40185,2
40186,It doesn't cover my back as I expected.,40186,2
40186,Fabric looks too much fake.,40186,2
40187,too much depth to insole hope your shoes are too big,40187,2
40188,Cheap material,40188,2
40189,Faded after first wash,40189,2
40190,Really like the shoes but it is waayyy too small!!,40190,2
40190,It will be too expensive to mail back so I can't return them :(,40190,2
40191,Arrived with a broken zipper,40191,2
40192,Really weird fit around arms,40192,2
40193,Much lighter than pictured.,40193,2
40193,Almost a light purplish grey,40193,2
40194,"Cheaply made, had to remove the elbow patches made of cheap flimsy material and they were sewn in the wrong spot for the elbow!",40194,2
40194,I wear it around the house when it's chilly but wouldn't buy again.,40194,2
40195,I liked this the first few days I was wearing them.,40195,2
40195,"They were washed with soap and water after each use, swishing them around, shook the water off and laid them, adhesive side up, to dry.",40195,2
40195,It said on the description that they're reusable 100 times.,40195,2
40195,I rarely use them so I thought they'd last a long time.,40195,2
40195,"To my dismay, I wasn't even on the 50 uses mark and the self adhesive started losing it's strength.",40195,2
40195,The edge of the pasties started lifting!,40195,2
40195,I tried returning them but I was only given a month to return.,40195,2
40195,Just giving everyone my honest opinion.,40195,2
40195,Just beware.,40195,2
40195,I'm disappointed.,40195,2
40196,"Not true to size, fits larger than expected",40196,2
40197,I thought this was for all 3 extenders.,40197,2
40197,"I see now that the product description does say it's only 1, but I feel the item name ending in ""gold black silver"" is pretty misleading.",40197,2
40197,"Also, this was a good price for 3 extenders - not so much for just 1.",40197,2
40198,The material thin & it's not true to size.,40198,2
40198,A small fits like a medium.,40198,2
40199,"Hope u have no titties, cuz it will only cover your front if u are flat.",40199,2
40199,Long.,40199,2
40199,Not enough material on the front to cover the chest and stomach.,40199,2
40200,Way too small.,40200,2
40200,Buy a size larger at least,40200,2
40201,I was really excited to get this product especially since they are so attractive.,40201,2
40201,They arrived very quickly which I was really glad about but once I got it I kind of regretted buying this.,40201,2
40201,This item is really really small!,40201,2
40201,If you do want to buy it then I strongly suggest that you get at least 2 sizes bigger than what you would think.,40201,2
40201,I tried this pair of underwear on and it was beyond snug.,40201,2
40201,If they fit fine then I would love the underwear but seeing as how they don't I'm really disappointed,40201,2
40202,Runs very small.,40202,2
40203,"The swimsuit is cute, but it does not fit.",40203,2
40203,"I am 5' 2"" and weigh about 100.",40203,2
40203,"The torso is too long, and the chest/hips too wide.",40203,2
40204,everyone laughed at me and said i looked like a penguin,40204,2
40205,The color is nice ...,40205,2
40205,It is shaped oddly ...,40205,2
40205,The back sits very low and lose ...,40205,2
40205,The back straps are lose ...,40205,2
40205,It fits as an oversize top for the beach or pool,40205,2
40206,"The color didn't match the color it showed on the picture... it shows like a sea green, but really it was a bright neon green",40206,2
40207,I ordered this for my boyfriend who usually wears a large tshirt.,40207,2
40207,I know all people are shaped differently but this shirt was very tight around the shoulders and neck area.,40207,2
40207,It seems that it's more of a 'slim fit' than an average fit.,40207,2
40207,"Unfortunately, he can't wear this product :(",40207,2
40208,Sleeves are too tight,40208,2
40209,I was not a fan of these- they were super snug although they don't look it when they are on.,40209,2
40209,But they feel like they are squeezing down your body.,40209,2
40209,I tried one workout class in them and I spent the whole time trying to keep them pulled up.,40209,2
40209,I would recommend a different brand,40209,2
40210,Quality like a third world sweat shop!,40210,2
40210,One size?,40210,2
40210,Please!,40210,2
40210,These things are huge!,40210,2
40211,Love the bag - size and pattern.,40211,2
40211,Have only used on limited basis since purchase on June 2 but grommet on strap broke and  I can't use it.,40211,2
40212,"Nothing to do with the photo, very poor quality product",40212,2
40213,Small.,40213,2
40214,"The purse is cute, but they chose the cheapest, crappiest zipper ever.",40214,2
40214,It catches and I can see it breaking very easily.,40214,2
40214,Returned.,40214,2
40215,This scarf smelled like mold.,40215,2
40215,"I had to soak it in vinegar, wash it twice and dry it to get the stink out of it.",40215,2
40216,This hat is far too large and there is no way to make it any tighter.,40216,2
40216,"This is for an adult, and I'm not happy with the size as when it make it as small as possible, it's STILL far too big.",40216,2
40216,Plus there is writing and an old year in the grey spot that you don't see when ordering the product.,40216,2
40216,"The seller chose not to disclose this in his listing which should have been disclosed for all buyers, not hidden or kept undisclosed.",40216,2
40217,Not as pictured,40217,2
40218,"the cloth was not as it looked in the photo, is very transparent and the cloth is thin.",40218,2
40219,these are very small.,40219,2
40219,"maybe for chinese people, not americans..",40219,2
40220,quality is not as it looks like in pictures,40220,2
40221,The sleeves are way too right on my arms.,40221,2
40221,"I am 5'7"" and weigh about 145.",40221,2
40221,I ordered a large and it really does not fit Comfy.,40221,2
40221,I would not recommend purchasing this shirt unless you order two sizes up.,40221,2
40222,"This is an average light weight rain jacket, but I bought a large and it barely fits me and I normally wear a small-medium.",40222,2
40222,I am very surprised because Columbia normally has good quality clothing.,40222,2
40222,Things made in China especially often end up needing to be ordered 2 sizes larger.,40222,2
40222,I will keep it since was buying a couple of rain jackets for future guests to use but now my imminent guests will be out of luck.,40222,2
40223,Fits very small and the arm sleeves are SUPER tight.,40223,2
40223,"I usually wear a large, I ordered an XL and the sleeves were way too tight.",40223,2
40223,I felt like I could tear them if I flexed.,40223,2
40224,Only had it a short time and a stone was already missing.,40224,2
40224,Now I can't wear it.,40224,2
40225,It looks like cotton in the picture but it is a chiffon-like material.,40225,2
40225,Doesn't have any shape and the belt doesn't have enough holes to make it fit nicely.,40225,2
40226,this suit ran small to size - wear a 16 ordered a 16-18 and this would fit a 10-12.,40226,2
40226,Fabric was not good quality and cannot imagine getting this suit wet....it would stretch out beyond controle.,40226,2
40226,"Also unless you are an A cup be ready to have no support, cups is very small.",40226,2
40227,"These fall off my wrist from time to time, even when I try to tighten them.",40227,2
40227,"I could probably live with that if the rubber band stayed on the bracelet, but it does not.",40227,2
40227,So I just don't wear them.,40227,2
40228,I gave it to my daughter,40228,2
40229,Fell part poorly made,40229,2
40230,The quality is pretty pore and they have a very strong and odd smell.,40230,2
40231,This is too small in the torso length and a little too big elsewhere,40231,2
40232,This shirt is way too small.,40232,2
40232,I think its made for a child.,40232,2
40232,Its good that i bought it as a gift for my beautiful petite mother in law.,40232,2
40232,She loved it.,40232,2
40232,If you're average sized.....I suggest you don't buy it.,40232,2
40232,Its largest size is super small.,40232,2
40233,Size was hard to determine.,40233,2
40233,The color silver was deceiving as they were actually gray.,40233,2
40234,Sleeves too small relative to rest of blouse.,40234,2
40234,Lots of loose threads from lace.,40234,2
40234,Disappointing.,40234,2
40235,Little to small,40235,2
40236,Too thin,40236,2
40237,"Bright bright gold, not what I expected.",40237,2
40238,Watch looked cool but band was chipped in two place.,40238,2
40239,I wish what came in my box was what is shown in the picture.,40239,2
40239,The bikini top is poorly made making the boobs look pointy and the fabric on one side bunching up.,40239,2
40239,"There aren't two straps included, just one that is secured like a halter.",40239,2
40239,I didn't even try the bottoms on because the top fit so strange.,40239,2
40239,The bottoms aren't made of thick wet suite material but thin regular bathing suite fabric.,40239,2
40240,"I am 5'5"", 170 lbs pre pregnancy and ordered an XL.",40240,2
40240,The leggings don't reach my ankles and the over the bump part only covers 3/4 of my belly and doesn't have any more room for adjustment - it's already on the last hole .,40240,2
40240,Material not as stretchy as I hoped and was hoping for a better fit.,40240,2
40240,May fit a more petite woman.,40240,2
40241,"I ordered the largest size and it would fit a very young, small teenager.",40241,2
40241,"It is a beautiful shirt and well made, but the sizing runs very small.",40241,2
40242,"fit poorly, seemed somewhat irregular, showed mediocre workmanship, no elasticity at all",40242,2
40243,It too big for me,40243,2
40244,Not the material I expected but great fit and very cute,40244,2
40245,Doesn't make you sweat at all waste of money but it's good for a tummy tuck.,40245,2
40245,Oh and also smaller then the actual size i ordered medium Fit like a small and looked like a small .,40245,2
40246,"It was larger than the other polo I had, I ordered the same size",40246,2
40247,I received my order Jan 27 and I have already thrown one pair away due to them ripping apart.,40247,2
40247,The panties run a little small but they are an attractive no show panty.,40247,2
40248,It was somewhat small.,40248,2
40248,So I just gave it to my daughter.,40248,2
40249,ITCHY!,40249,2
40249,Didn't look That great on me.,40249,2
40249,I returned it.,40249,2
40250,I returned these as they were not true to size.,40250,2
40250,They ran large.,40250,2
40251,"I loved this bag when I first got it but 5 months later the pocket on the inside broke open, the strap broke, one of the handles braking",40251,2
40252,First of all this shirt runs VERY small.,40252,2
40252,I usually wear a L or XL.,40252,2
40252,I bought this in a XXL due to the reviews of other buyers.,40252,2
40252,It fit perfect.,40252,2
40252,The problem is that you have to have a neck like a linebacker for this shirt to fit anything to close to a turtleneck.,40252,2
40252,For that reason I returned it.,40252,2
40252,I was very disappointed.,40252,2
40253,Too large (size 2 more like a size 4 or 5).,40253,2
40253,Too long.,40253,2
40253,Wanted just above the knees (I'm 5'4 but have long legs).,40253,2
40253,Material darker than shown and cheap-looking.,40253,2
40254,It looks OK,40254,2
40255,The picture was an iron on and after a while looked very worn and wrinkled.,40255,2
40256,The XL was very snug on a normally size 12.,40256,2
40256,Needed to get at least 2 sizes larger to drape like in picture.,40256,2
40257,This product it very cheaply made.,40257,2
40258,"Cheap metal, the color came off on my neck after the first time wearing it.",40258,2
40259,It was somewhat small,40259,2
40260,Disappointed with the material.,40260,2
40261,I got it in A medium & it was too small,40261,2
40262,These earrings are well made but are very heavy.,40262,2
40263,"I do like the necklace, but the connection pieces were not properly crimped.",40263,2
40263,"I have a crimping tool, but it seems like when I've crimped one area, another becomes disconnected.",40263,2
40263,"I don't feel that it's secure enough to wear out, yet, but when I do, I'm planning to put a spare necklace in my purse!",40263,2
40264,"We'll see if a third time is a charm, but at this point, the sizes for this item make no sense.",40264,2
40264,I wear 34x34 pants.,40264,2
40264,"I bought the Large of this item, which should be ""37"" waist, according to the chart that Amazon shows.",40264,2
40264,Too short.,40264,2
40264,"I bought the XL, which is a ""41"" waist.",40264,2
40264,"The waist fit was about the same as the L, but it's still too short.",40264,2
40264,I'm going to buy the XXL but I have my doubts.,40264,2
40264,"How about instead of L, XL, XXL... you just change the sizes to reflect actual numbers!?",40264,2
40264,There's an idea.,40264,2
40265,This came back much smaller than anticipated.,40265,2
40266,"My feet are 9, I got size 9 and they do not fit, like I can not get them on my feet.",40266,2
40266,I love the look of them...,40266,2
40266,I have got shoos from here befor and I love them.,40266,2
40266,Im sad about this =C,40266,2
40267,"Too small, not USA sizing, too much to ship back as international shipping costs.",40267,2
40268,I love London!,40268,2
40268,So when I saw this onesie I was so excited about getting it!,40268,2
40268,It looked so cute and I read it was 100% cotton so I trusted the quality will be good and after reading other reviews I decided to get it.,40268,2
40268,It was so soft and cute but today I washed it with cold water along with some new clothes I got at Carters and this onesie was the only one that shrank.,40268,2
40268,I got size 6 months and now it is size 3!!!,40268,2
40268,So disappointed!,40268,2
40269,"The awesome rainbow finish rubbed off very quickly, any smudges show up very easily as well.",40269,2
40270,Shrunk and became VERY SHORT!,40270,2
40271,"bottom great - top way too small about the banding and no sensible means to adjust, small by about 3-4 inches!!!",40271,2
40271,"am 5'9"" and 130 lbs so not fat  The suit would be rather nice if able to wear it - cannot even have the clips for bra top even near meeting",40271,2
40272,very thin materal not like picture,40272,2
40273,Material is light and dress is short.,40273,2
40274,SLEEVE LENGTH SHORT AND WIDTH NARROW - MORE OF A JUNIORS SMALL.,40274,2
40275,to small,40275,2
40276,I really like this hoodie!,40276,2
40276,"Unfortunately however it's way too long for me i'm 5'7"" (170cms) and this hoodie while it fits my upper body very well where as I'm a 36 chest .... i have to say I am not pleased at all with the length.",40276,2
40276,I was hoping for something that sits on the hips  more but this is so long that it passes my butt!,40276,2
40276,"Well while i do have a fat butt, this looks weird on me, because it kinda makes my butt look bigger since it flows over my rear it looks like i'm wearing a dress sorta, so what I have to do is hike it up on my hip which caused the excess fabric to roll over and bulge which looks stupid because it makes me look like i have a big beer gut lol.... it's not a pleasant look TRUST ME!...",40276,2
40276,"if you were 6 foot and taller this would work great for you guys, but with me not at all pleased!",40276,2
40276,"I do have a longer lower body and shorter upper body, perhaps if your upper frame is longer it might work!",40276,2
40276,GOOD LUCK ON YOUR PURCHASE!,40276,2
40277,I'm a little peeved because parts of the costume stuck together and took the color off when I pulled it apart.,40277,2
40277,The tissue paper also stuck on the tiara star and won't come off,40277,2
40278,Super cute.,40278,2
40278,but waaaaay too small!,40278,2
40278,I ordered the x-large and it fits my 10 year old daughter who is 105#!,40278,2
40279,"So, I tried putting one in my nose for work the edges are sharp where the top clips in so my nose piercing started to bleed and I couldn't get it in.",40279,2
40279,"So, thinking not so much and went another route.",40279,2
40279,"By the way, my metal nose rings are 12g so I don't think it's b/c they're too big!!!",40279,2
40279,!,40279,2
40280,"I know we live in a ""throwaway"" culture, but I really expected to be able to have these shoes for my child until she outgrew them.",40280,2
40280,My 4 year old wears them to preschool for 4 hours daily then takes them off when she comes home.,40280,2
40280,She doesn't wear them outside of that time frame.,40280,2
40280,"The shoes were very cute out of the box, bright colored and sparkly.",40280,2
40280,My daughter was very excited.,40280,2
40280,The zippers are heavy so they do the job.,40280,2
40280,The fobs on the zippers are flimsy and not heavy.,40280,2
40280,"I really hoped these shoes would make it, because they are adorable.",40280,2
40280,Only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1.,40280,2
40280,"The shoelaces are absolutely, ridiculously too long.",40280,2
40280,I have included pictures.,40280,2
40280,What is the point of this?,40280,2
40280,A little kid does not need 2 foot long overhang on shoelaces.,40280,2
40280,This is a huge safety hazard.,40280,2
40280,"I have to quintuple knot her shoelaces so that the laces so not drag, as she will not let me tuck them in, and they would not stay tucked in, at any rate, because just too long.",40280,2
40280,The cute pink bows are not sewn on or even into a bow shape.,40280,2
40280,"They are glued on, and have fallen off already (see pic).",40280,2
40280,This is very disappointing and we had a tantrum over this as well.,40280,2
40280,The rubber toes are already peeling back also.,40280,2
40280,I am looking for a better pair of lace up shoes.,40280,2
40280,Don't waste your money.,40280,2
40281,"Way too small in the hip area - everywhere else fits fine, but I won't be able to use these.",40281,2
40281,I had a much better experience with a different brand.,40281,2
40281,I would not recommend these!,40281,2
40282,"One size fits all did not fit my size 10 body.very hard to slide over my head, not much stretch material.",40282,2
40283,"It did not fit me, too big!!",40283,2
40283,How can I go by exchanging?,40283,2
40283,?,40283,2
40284,"Looks great on the outside, but the inside feels cheap, especially the zippers .",40284,2
40284,Don't think it could stand up to frequent travel and constant use,40284,2
40285,Not completely happy with this bag but it is not entirely the fault of the bag.,40285,2
40285,It is too large on the inside and not enough pockets so everything is loose and hard to find.,40285,2
40285,"Would work great if you are carrying larger items like books or electronics, etc.",40285,2
40285,Also the bag has a terrible smell that may go away in time but I found it hard to deal with.,40285,2
40286,"Alright jacket, not worth the price.",40286,2
40286,Made of a pleather material but is more on the plastic side.,40286,2
40286,Adjustments do nothing and most pockets have no access.,40286,2
40287,The product arrived in a timely fashion..,40287,2
40287,But you get what you pay for..i wore them twice before the little screws released themselves now i have a nice pair of armless shades.,40287,2
40288,I fit size 12-14 and these just wouldn't fit.,40288,2
40288,The pattern is quite nice & the mesh is fairly durable.,40288,2
40289,"This is really short, I got a larger size because of other reviews.",40289,2
40289,It was really short and way too wide.,40289,2
40290,"Cute and well made
But
I have a small head for an adult and this hat was too small for me.",40290,2
40290,I had to give to a friends little girl.,40290,2
40291,A bit more taller cloth part than per picture (almost to the point of a chef's hat rather than chauffeur type).,40291,2
40291,Otherwise it is what it is but visor already cracking and looks a bit cheesy.,40291,2
40292,Blue and red was SUPER faded......nothing like the picture.,40292,2
40292,"and WAY to small for a large, I'm totally disappointed.",40292,2
40292,Fast shipping though,40292,2
40293,Not what we were looking for - not as described.,40293,2
40294,not to size and very thin material,40294,2
40295,It's kind of cheaply made for the price.,40295,2
40295,"The top of the dress is just stretchy, spandex-like material.",40295,2
40295,Not what I expected.,40295,2
40295,"It also poofs out at the skirt, and just looks kind of awkward overall.",40295,2
40296,It popped and i didn't even have it for a week.,40296,2
40296,"The leo sign also changed colors even though i never showered with it on, only washed my hands.",40296,2
40296,I won't give it 1 star simply because i liked the design,40296,2
40297,"Looks better in picture, bought 3, one came broken, returned all.",40297,2
40298,Bad material and came all wrinkle.,40298,2
40299,"To start with, the wife is normally a size small, 34B, size 4.",40299,2
40299,We read that the suit runs small so we ordered up a size to a medium.,40299,2
40299,"The top was still too small and pushed up and inward, but was too narrow at the same time.",40299,2
40299,"The bottom was very big in the front, but only slightly big in the back.",40299,2
40299,The front (no matter how it was tied) was cut almost like portly pants.,40299,2
40299,There was about a two inch gap between my wife's waist and the waist of the suit.,40299,2
40299,This bikini is just cut weird.,40299,2
40300,I was a bit disappointed that the dress is so sheer.,40300,2
40300,There is no inner lining.,40300,2
40300,I will have to buy a slip in order to wear it.,40300,2
40300,"Also, upon opening, it smells like very strong chemicals.",40300,2
40301,Should be listed as children's bracelet because it goes not fit the wrist of a 6' tall adult.,40301,2
40301,Very disappointing.,40301,2
40302,It is nice for kids or maybe a young teen.,40302,2
40302,The wallet is cute but I struggle to get my cards out and I don't like that.,40302,2
40303,Very cheaply made and not worth the asking price.,40303,2
40303,Definitely not what I was expecting.,40303,2
40303,They won't be used for anything other than around the house.,40303,2
40304,"Had to give it away, too small for my average sized 15 year old.",40304,2
40305,Fit as expected.,40305,2
40305,Wore once (hadn't even washed it yet) and it had already started pilling.,40305,2
40306,"Very thin, looks cheap, but for the price.",40306,2
40306,"I have small 118 lbs 5'3, fit good.",40306,2
40307,"Stone was separated, not mounted on necklace.",40307,2
40307,We glued it in place and now it looks good.,40307,2
40308,The supposedly neon leggings fit comfortably but didn't match the color as advertised.,40308,2
40308,I recieved what appeared to be washed out pink as opposed to neon pink.,40308,2
40309,Great pattern.,40309,2
40309,The shorts have a stretchy waistband so they go on well.,40309,2
40309,"The shirt, however fit poorly and I tore the fabric when I touched my elbows together.",40309,2
40309,I'm fairly slim with a slight athletic build.,40309,2
40309,I'm 5'5 and weigh 150 lb.,40309,2
40310,I just didn't love these.,40310,2
40310,I put them on and they felt very strange to me.,40310,2
40310,The part that goes over your belly is a different fabric than the pant and it is shaped kind of strange.,40310,2
40310,"I have many other pregnancy leggings and usually the area that goes over the tummy is just an extension of the pants, which I like much better.",40310,2
40310,"Since these do have the two separate parts to the pants, I also can't imagine being able to wear them after pregnancy, where as most you could just roll the top down and get some extra mileage out of them.",40310,2
40310,These were sent back.,40310,2
40311,"Don't really care for this, sorry.",40311,2
40311,Nice dark green though.,40311,2
40311,I would send back but it would be too costly.,40311,2
40312,Very flimsy and cheaply,40312,2
40313,I ordered XL since chart said US 8....it's HUGE!,40313,2
40313,"Like 2 sizes...maybe even 3 too big...other wise, it looks ok...not worth sending back so I'll re purpose fabric and sew a flowy tunic tank instead.",40313,2
40314,They show in every shoe I tried on with them.,40314,2
40315,The magnets are much too weak to hold even 4 or 5 bills securely.,40315,2
40315,"My advice for anyone looking at this item,  DO NOT BUY IT.",40315,2
40316,Looks and feels cheap.,40316,2
40316,I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift.,40316,2
40317,"After one washing and drying by directions, it shrank too much!!",40317,2
40317,"If you wear a large, you definitely need to order an extra large!!",40317,2
40317,!,40317,2
40318,The material is filmsy and cheap,40318,2
40319,The detail on the top of the ring is much smaller and poorer quality than it appears in this picture.,40319,2
40319,I am very disappointed.,40319,2
40320,No good.,40320,2
40320,Grommets fall out after 1 use.,40320,2
40321,The letters were not darker than the rest of the bracelet.,40321,2
40321,They were just punched into the leather.,40321,2
40321,"The first time it got wet, the leather swelled and the letters are no longer visible.",40321,2
40322,"Opening is too small, can't really put much in it, but its a good looking purse!",40322,2
40323,Absolutely adorable dress.,40323,2
40323,Fit me really well in the body but wayyy too short.,40323,2
40323,I'm 5'10 and 155lbs.,40323,2
40323,My lady bits were literally hanging out!!!,40323,2
40323,Total bummer.,40323,2
40323,"I ordered a medium, going to try a large.",40323,2
40323,"Hopefully it'll long enough in the crotch

Update: I ended up ordering the large, much looser of a fit which I didn't mind but again it was way too short in the crotch.",40323,2
40323,"I wore it out in Vegas, because Vegas, but I was tugging at it all night long and I guarantee I accidentally flashed a few people.",40323,2
40323,"Really unfortunate because I love the dress, the top part didn't bother me as other reviews had said, it fits on the top exactly as you would expect it to, it's just slit right in the crotch and if you have any hips at all it just spreads the slit :/ pretty crappy",40323,2
40324,Material way to flimsy.,40324,2
40324,Feels like a yard / house dress,40324,2
40325,This product is mediocre at best.,40325,2
40325,"The material are cheaply designed and uncomfortable to wear, if you have sweating issues.",40325,2
40326,This dress is flimsy and and a bit small.,40326,2
40326,Cant imagine it will make it through the washer many times-too bad.,40326,2
40326,Thought it was so cute.,40326,2
40327,"The sweater is nice and soft, but the sizing is terrible..........usual size is way too small......",40327,2
40328,I really like the style of this suit but during the first wear the underwire popped out!,40328,2
40328,It has not soft edge on the ends to prevent it and dug into me immediately.,40328,2
40328,"I'm going to do my best to fix it myself and wrap the ends in electrical tape, stuff them back in and sew them shut.",40328,2
40329,"So small none of me or my friends could wear it, sold it to clothing store for $2..",40329,2
40329,Came from China couldn't return,40329,2
40330,Good only as house dress.,40330,2
40330,Very cheep fabric not even close to denim,40330,2
40331,Order a size or two up to achieve the look on model,40331,2
40332,Much smaller than I expected.,40332,2
40332,Had to buy another case for lingerie presents.,40332,2
40332,Will use as cosmetic case gift for her.,40332,2
40332,"Unless you are packing nothing but thongs, underwear pouches are too smalL but are perfect for makeup accessories.",40332,2
40332,But fit the price will use it for something,40332,2
40333,"The ""large"" fits me like a small would.",40333,2
40333,"I am 5'6"", 130lbs.",40333,2
40333,Not okay.,40333,2
40333,I wanted it to fit bigger and drape better.,40333,2
40333,Very displeased with the size & quality isn't the best either.,40333,2
40334,"It was cute, I loved it for the short time it last.",40334,2
40334,The leather is very thin and my bag ripped... at least I got a good two weeks out of it,40334,2
40335,"Too small, and not worth the expense of returning.",40335,2
40335,"I bought this for my Mom, who was looking for a shoulder bag that had a firmer build to it - where the sides would collapse or look sloppy.",40335,2
40335,"This bad fit those needs, but ... if you drop your wallet into the purse, and reach in to take it out - the bag's opening is so small/narrow that you can't get your wallet out in your hand.",40335,2
40336,The dress recieved was very different from pictured.,40336,2
40336,"Sleeves,neckline, waistline, back and lining were all different.",40336,2
40336,It did not fit well at all and was very scratchy and uncomfortable.,40336,2
40336,I still gave 2 stars due to the fact that the seller was quick to respond and offered a partial refund.,40336,2
40336,In all I would not reccomend buying this dress,40336,2
40337,This is a cheap knock off.,40337,2
40337,It doesnt look like denim and it is very flimsyband cheap looking,40337,2
40338,Read reviews before purchasing and opted to get a medium instead of a small.,40338,2
40338,Fit is too tight over my shoulders and literally cannot bring the two sides over my chest to zip up.,40338,2
40338,Will return and get a larger size as this is indeed a beautiful jacket and I love wearing dusters since they fit my tall frame and give me a more elegant look.,40338,2
40339,These fit like granny panties would.,40339,2
40339,Very saggy around the rear end.,40339,2
40339,"Comfortable, just not as expected.",40339,2
40339,"Plus, I paid 10$ to send them back.",40339,2
40339,Which is riciculous!,40339,2
40340,"I'm really disappointed in this product, I bought this thinking it would be good for a Kim Kardashian costume on Halloween as a joke because when I typed ""Kim Kardashian costume"" on Amazon this was one of the first things that popped up..",40340,2
40340,"I ordered a large which size 6-8 is pretty big on me but I didn't want it to fit right because i knew I was probably going to have to stuff it a lot because obviously Kim K's butt is huge .. Anyways, it's actually pretty small on me the material is too tight on my thighs and bathing suit area which is very uncomfortable, I want to return this back and get a bigger size (I don't know if I can but whatever) even if I could return it it wouldn't be back in time for a Halloween party I'm going to on the 21st next month because it took 2 and a half weeks for this butt pad to come in and it would probably take even longer to send back because it's sent from China and then once it gets in China it would have to be sent back and that would just be too late for the party I'm going to :(( this barely has any padding and doesn't really make difference at all, I don't know if I could try to stretch it out by pulling on it with my hands so it will actually feel comfortable and not break but I guess I'll have to see :/ I do not recommend this if you're expecting a big difference .. You can only see a slight difference if you put on skinny jeans (the last picture is how thin the padding is)",40340,2
40341,Not worth price...nice bit cheap looking and made...once u put one card in each a lot the wallet can barely close without stretching...u think they would of made alil more room becuz of that...walmart is cheaper n better quality,40341,2
40342,Loved the front but the back clings,40342,2
40343,It was nice but it ran small I got an extra large and it was more like 38 size.,40343,2
40343,Had to return it.,40343,2
40344,Super cheap material.,40344,2
40344,So thin I can see right through it.,40344,2
40344,The hem is also cheap looking.,40344,2
40344,It's not as drappy as I wanted and it's much smaller than I expected.,40344,2
40344,Even with a large.,40344,2
40344,Might work as a bikini cover up.,40344,2
40344,Not sure.,40344,2
40344,But it was only $6 so who can complain that much.,40344,2
40344,You get what you pay for.,40344,2
40345,"Top creates a uniboob, the shorts while snug aren't too tight but the seam literally seriously goes right in the middle of where it shouldn't be--- major camel toe, ive never had this issue woth leggings or bathing suits, but with these shorts it's like im advertising- the design however is adorable the print is great-",40345,2
40346,Says newborn..,40346,2
40346,Fits my 4 year olds head not my newborns!,40346,2
40347,The length was okay.,40347,2
40347,But it gripped by hip area in a very weird way.,40347,2
40347,Seem like girl pants.,40347,2
40347,"Plus, the material is not very stylish.",40347,2
40347,I can't describe it very well.,40347,2
40347,The best comparison I can come up with is the material used in old and extremely unstylish suits.,40347,2
40348,Knock off Havianas.,40348,2
40348,Keeping them because they are a nice color option in navy,40348,2
40349,I'm small.,40349,2
40349,Usually extra small.,40349,2
40349,"I ordered a small and while it fits, the arms are too short.",40349,2
40349,"And trust me, I don't have long arms.",40349,2
40349,Going to just end up giving it to a 10 yo I know.,40349,2
40350,2 of the 3 Chains broke the first day.,40350,2
40351,Wrinkled so badly I washed and dried it but it did not relieve the wrinkles.,40351,2
40351,Must be ironed.,40351,2
40351,I have not ironed it yet so I have not tried it on.,40351,2
40351,Hope it fits..,40351,2
40352,I just got this set in the mail.,40352,2
40352,Not pleased with it.,40352,2
40352,It is not rose gold..it is yellow gold.,40352,2
40352,Bought specifically for the rose gold so I am sad!,40352,2
40353,"The tights were nice, but too small: My measurements are 34C/35 Bust, 31 Waist and Hips 41.",40353,2
40354,it was suppose to be Yellow but its not...,40354,2
40354,It look more like a mint green... will be sending it back!,40354,2
40354,(FYI  it also has a very weird smell.,40354,2
40354,I think once you wash it.,40354,2
40354,It Should come out .,40354,2
40354,I will not know if it actually works because I'm not be keeping it.),40354,2
40355,"After wearing them  few time, I cannot fit the small post into the larger post as if something is jammed inside.",40355,2
40355,I am no longer able to wear them.,40355,2
40356,"Although I bought a size larger than was given for my weight and height, the product was still too short in the crotch and rise.",40356,2
40357,These run very small and are see threw.,40357,2
40357,They look good in the picture but you can see everything you try to wear under them.,40357,2
40358,I don't think the designer of this dress allotted for chest growth in maternity.,40358,2
40358,I ended wearing it backward with a cardigan to feel covered up top.,40358,2
40359,"Unfortunately too small ,",40359,2
40360,"Extremely thin, but ok for simmer gift.",40360,2
40361,"5
The watch 0nly comes in one size and being female with small wrist the face of the watch and the band were way to big.",40361,2
40362,Pretty bad quality but the price is pretty low.,40362,2
40362,Threads are starting to come undone from the bottom of the shirt.,40362,2
40362,After a single wash the entire thread on the bottom back has come out.,40362,2
40362,"The lettering feels like something I used to iron on my shirt ""back in the day"" (the 80s - I'm old).",40362,2
40362,I love the design and would have paid $20 for it but the quality is sub-par.,40362,2
40363,Theyre good is I was skinny!,40363,2
40363,I got a size 36 thinking they were going to fit because I'm a size 34 so obviously I thought they would fit but when I got them I'd say they were a size 32,40363,2
40364,Had to return it because it did not fit as the picture and the top ran too small.,40364,2
40365,Quality was not bad but they were too small.,40365,2
40365,I'm disappointed.,40365,2
40366,It was a little smaller than expected but that was alright because it was such a cute backpack.,40366,2
40366,"However, one of the side pockets had a broken zipper that would not zip up.",40366,2
40366,"I still took it out for the day because one broken zipper wasn't going to change how excited I was, but after a few hours I noticed the seams of the backpack in the front were coming undone.",40366,2
40366,So yeah...,40366,2
40366,"Very poor quality, won't last, just buy something else.",40366,2
40366,Safe yourself some wasted time and money.,40366,2
40366,I already printed my return label.,40366,2
40366,Time to send this back :(,40366,2
40367,Zipper wasent even on waist trainer  very dissapointed,40367,2
40368,Not true to size,40368,2
40369,The product is not worth the money I paid for it.,40369,2
40369,I will have it customized - which certainly will cost more than the dress itself.,40369,2
40369,Bad quality - like all the products coming from China.,40369,2
40370,On top of it being too small... Used it once and it discolored already.,40370,2
40370,The white part had red stains and the red part had navy blue stains.,40370,2
40371,It is made in Thailand and it is 100% Rayon instead of it claimed Indian Kurta Tunic and cotton!,40371,2
40371,I bought X-large and it came the XXLarge.,40371,2
40371,Totally disappointed!,40371,2
40371,The craftsmanship is extremely bad and the stitches at the chest area are not fit at all in the middle and was badly sewed.,40371,2
40371,The quality check is totally failed.,40371,2
40371,Pity just don't know why photo cannot be uploaded or it could be viewed more clearly...,40371,2
40372,Nice but made for Asian type body's,40372,2
40373,too small.,40373,2
40374,"The shirt is super cute but can I say ""x-small"" for a XXL.",40374,2
40374,There is no possible way that this can be an 2XL.,40374,2
40374,I guess another gift to my very slender sister.,40374,2
40375,Didn't look like the picture.,40375,2
40375,"The color was not right either, it was suppose to be blue and it was turquoise instead.",40375,2
40376,"super tight at the waist (the elastic here seems smaller than the rest of the pants, so it is difficult to get over the hips).",40376,2
40377,"The chains are just ok.  As usual,  the photo is deceptive,  this necklace is something one would wear poolside,  chlorine and all.",40377,2
40378,It's not an XL.,40378,2
40378,More like a medium.,40378,2
40378,Way too tight and I can't stretch or alter it to fit.,40378,2
40379,Good size for a 5 yr old but after only 2 months the opening mechanism broke so now it's unusable.,40379,2
40379,Poor quality for the price since we now have to buy a new umbrella.,40379,2
40380,Very cute but the back of the earrings plastic grip wouldn't hold it,40380,2
40381,Not for Tall Women.,40381,2
40381,Waist too high,40381,2
40382,"This is a horrible garment on me, It DOES make your butt look bigger however NOT in a good way.",40382,2
40382,The look is VERY unnatural and the outline around your butt shows through cloths.,40382,2
40382,Maybe in jeans it would not be as noticeable of a deformed shape but in dresses and slacks it shows CLEARLY something ain't right.,40382,2
40382,Just check out the pics of everyone who posted one to seem what I mean.,40382,2
40383,"Coat is okay, nothing special.",40383,2
40383,"Very cheaply made and the fit is a small junior cut, not women's.",40383,2
40383,"I wear a size 6-8 and this coat just fits, with no room for a sweater underneath.",40383,2
40383,"Had I tried this on in a store, I would not have purchased it, but I am too lazy to return it.",40383,2
40383,Would be great for a teen and should be marketed as such.,40383,2
40384,After on for two days did not charge watch.,40384,2
40385,It's too narrow.,40385,2
40386,"I'm 5'6, 120 pounds, usually wear size small or 4/6 with 34/C bra.",40386,2
40386,Ordered a large after reading reviews and it was still too small.,40386,2
40386,I have the same bathing suit in yellow that I ordered off of another site for 5$ more and it is made with way better quality matieral and stiching.,40386,2
40386,"If you are like me, slim with a lot of hips and even a little bit of breasts I would not recommend this item.",40386,2
40386,It's made for woman that are very very slim.,40386,2
40386,"So upset cause I really loved the style and white looks great with a tan, and the price wasn't bad either.",40386,2
40387,to small,40387,2
40388,I don't understand why they put fits as expected.,40388,2
40388,This was way smaller than a normal sized dress.,40388,2
40388,I wear a size 10 or M so that;s what I ordered.,40388,2
40388,"So sad because it came, but took three weeks even though it said it was Prime.",40388,2
40388,It's pretty fabric and very soft I am sending it back and going to try it in a XL.,40388,2
40388,That's right it was that off on the size!!!,40388,2
40388,I hope it works out I really like the dress.,40388,2
40389,very thin can see through,40389,2
40390,Not so happy.,40390,2
40390,Looks nice for a cocktail party ring.,40390,2
40391,These fit really funny.,40391,2
40391,They are too big in the waistband and too small in the butt.,40391,2
40391,I have briefs in the same size and they fit nothing alike.,40391,2
40392,Cheap feeling fabric.,40392,2
40393,This item smelled like it had been packaged for a long time.,40393,2
40393,I had to wash it about 5 times just to try to get the smell out.,40393,2
40394,Very small,40394,2
40395,still can't figure out  how  to put them on.,40395,2
40395,they look nice if I could figure how to wear it.,40395,2
40396,Size not accurate.,40396,2
40396,Ordered an XL but seemed more like a medium/large.,40396,2
40397,"Got an S, returned it for an M and there's no difference I think the product is one size fits all.",40397,2
40397,I'm 5'8 and it's not long enough,40397,2
40398,It's too small@!!,40398,2
40398,And I have to mail it back and I need to pay the shipping fee.,40398,2
40398,I don't think I will buy anything from this brand again....,40398,2
40399,way too small,40399,2
40400,"ruined very quickly, leather pulled from shoe and started to fall apart.",40400,2
40401,I bought this for an adult and it very tiny like for a small child even the tie pin is very tiny it said men's so I thought is would have been for a man not a child,40401,2
40402,All the colored ones started looking the color when I wore them.,40402,2
40403,Looks like you're wearing a sack,40403,2
40404,The dress may be a little short but what I didn't like was that the white part of the dress has a red hint to it so if your inside or if the fabric isn't stretched the dress looks more pink then it does white,40404,2
40405,They were much larger than I realized.,40405,2
40406,Stone in one of earring was missing,40406,2
40407,I like the dress but you sent it with a stain on the front of it.,40407,2
40407,"I attempted to clean it myself, but there is still some residue.",40407,2
40407,What a disappointment with a stain.,40407,2
40407,I am wearing this on my wedding day.,40407,2
40408,"for something advertised as plus size, this was smaller than expected.",40408,2
40408,Also the dress is flimsy and basically exposed my breasts.,40408,2
40408,I wish I hadn't bought it.,40408,2
40409,After less than two weeks of using this as directed the band is constantly scrunching up in the middle and riding up.,40409,2
40409,The scrunching is so bad that there are now permanent ridges in the middle of the band.,40409,2
40409,"I really wanted to like this and I think it was working well, but I don't know that I can continue using it when it is this uncomfortable due to the bunching.",40409,2
40410,"It's a very cute suit, but the sizing was way too small and the quality isn't the greatest.",40410,2
40411,The arms are super tight and small.,40411,2
40411,The measurements do not include that information.,40411,2
40412,Product was to small.,40412,2
40412,The size chart is not accurate.,40412,2
40413,The arrow ring arrived nearly broken.,40413,2
40413,And the diamond shaped ring didn't want to stay put.,40413,2
40413,More hassle then they are worth.,40413,2
40413,Also the rings faded within a week of wearing.,40413,2
40414,I bought a large and this fits like a small.,40414,2
40414,I would order at least 2 sizes bigger than what you normally do.,40414,2
40415,very plunging neckline.. too much emphasis on the chest,40415,2
40416,"Fit is horrible, no shape to it whatsoever.",40416,2
40416,Would be great for a cover up by pool etc.,40416,2
40416,I bought it to wear with an everday look but can't-WAY to big and absolutely no shape to it.,40416,2
40416,Save your money if you want something other than a moo moo cover up.,40416,2
40417,The L hook is way too thick and it is making my nose bleed.,40417,2
40417,I love the design and the quality looks amazing but it is too thick for my nose.,40417,2
40418,Too small and poor quality.,40418,2
40418,I returned it.,40418,2
40419,Just ok,40419,2
40420,"The material is cheap, too small, top is made for girls with no boobs.",40420,2
40421,To small,40421,2
40422,"It looks much better in the picture, looks very cheap in person.",40422,2
40423,Cute.,40423,2
40424,I got a men's small but it seemed more like a women's small.,40424,2
40424,The fabric is thin-- fine if you like that.,40424,2
40424,The print quality is fine--the colors are clear and bright enough.,40424,2
40424,I returned mine because it was too small --I am awaiting the larger size.,40424,2
40425,Too big,40425,2
40426,Not as elegant as it looks in the picture.,40426,2
40427,I love the color and I love the fit but if there is a stain in a mile vicinity it will find its way to this shirt and it doesn't come off,40427,2
40428,"This hat was not do good, it never felt like it broke in right and felt a bit cheap.",40428,2
40428,I ended up replacing it about a month later with another one of higher quality that fit better.,40428,2
40429,This rosary was okay it only lasted acouple days before it broke,40429,2
40430,"This was really short in the body, and I've since learned that can happen because of where they are made.",40430,2
40430,Unfortunately the waist only comes down just below my bust.,40430,2
40430,Looks ridiculous.,40430,2
40430,"If you are short in the torso this would probably work for you, but I will have to give my unworn dress to Goodwill.",40430,2
40430,Such a waste of money.,40430,2
40431,M size looks as a L size.,40431,2
40432,The rocking horse was missing from the set.,40432,2
40432,My daughter was upset.,40432,2
40432,Other than that it's good quality,40432,2
40433,"The passport sleeve is made of clear plastic, rather than leather.",40433,2
40433,For a part of the wallet that will get a lot of wear this seems like a bad choice of material.,40433,2
40433,The plastic will eventually crack as can be seen in the one picture that shows the sleeve uncovered.,40433,2
40433,I returned the wallet the day after receiving it.,40433,2
40434,Stitch came apart after first trial.,40434,2
40434,Returned it...,40434,2
40435,Nice fabric but it is a foot-longer than me.,40435,2
40435,I am 5'-tall...it's made for tall women,40435,2
40436,Nothing like the picture.,40436,2
40436,"The picture makes the material look relaxed and loose, this is a thick cotton that stands stiff.",40436,2
40436,Not worth the $11.,40436,2
40437,The balls fell off as soon as granddaughter opened box,40437,2
40438,not good as i think (about size),40438,2
40439,Very small..is women style..,40439,2
40440,Great price but they are very small for my tongue which is causing discomfort,40440,2
40441,Lol a little too oversized..,40441,2
40441,I looked like a clown lol..,40441,2
40442,"Like the other customers stated, the needles to pierce with is way too small to help with connecting the belly button ring that needs to go with it.",40442,2
40442,I was really disappointed in this right away.,40442,2
40442,I really can not recommend this item to others.,40442,2
40442,I looked over all my options of how to do it correctly with this issue and continued on.,40442,2
40442,Cleaned everything with alcohol even though items was sealed.,40442,2
40442,Pierced with needle from bottom up so I could guide the ring threw right under the needle.,40442,2
40442,I put the cover back on the needle once through the skin to protect from any punctures.,40442,2
40442,I guided the  belly button ring right under the needle and pushed up slowly.,40442,2
40442,Once at the top you may have issues getting the ring  through the skin since you have to be quick as needle will be coming out.,40442,2
40442,This is where you will wish the needle and ring was connected as I did.,40442,2
40442,I really thought  the needle was not sharp enough and the clamp is made of plastic but it did it hold.,40442,2
40442,There is better kits out.,40442,2
40443,Material is then but it is a Halloween costume!,40443,2
40444,"After the long wait to arrive, was much to small.",40444,2
40444,Quality is about what you would expect at this price.,40444,2
40444,Just need a smaller kid.,40444,2
40445,"Good lanyard, nice quality and design.",40445,2
40445,I've had one for a couple years and it hasn't broken.,40445,2
40445,"However, I purchased it for $12.80, and when I recieved it, it has a price tag of $10.00 on it.",40445,2
40445,Couldn't help but feel ripped off a bit.,40445,2
40445,I might suggest looking somewhere else to purchase this; I was very surprised since Amazon usually has the best price.,40445,2
40446,The sleeves are too tight and the rest of the shirt is too baggy.,40446,2
40446,Not what i expected.,40446,2
40446,"too bad, cause it's really cute.",40446,2
40447,funny but came so flat a creased we sent it back,40447,2
40448,Ordered 1/2 size larger as per the sizing guide and they still felt at least a full size too small.,40448,2
40449,Changed color only after a few days wearing.,40449,2
40449,Don't recommend.,40449,2
40450,The dress material snugs.,40450,2
40450,Seaming has threads coming out at sleeves.,40450,2
40450,Ok for prize.,40450,2
40451,"This is very stiff fabric, it reminds me of cotton canvas.",40451,2
40451,The printing was nice and the shape was nice.,40451,2
40451,The bust should have fit -- I measure a couple inches smaller than the size I ordered.,40451,2
40451,"However, it was way too small in the bosom.",40451,2
40452,I didn't like.,40452,2
40452,I gave it to charity.,40452,2
40452,very large fitting and I didn't like the material.,40452,2
40453,sent  it back,40453,2
40454,It fit okay!,40454,2
40454,Was rather tight on the thighs but other than that it fit well!,40454,2
40454,Already had some seems unraveling!,40454,2
40455,This was thinner and flatter than expected and the size was a bit small but overall it was a nice skirt.,40455,2
40456,Did not receive pictured item,40456,2
40457,leather looked cheap.,40457,2
40458,Too short,40458,2
40459,Side breast shows.,40459,2
40459,It is also a little see through.,40459,2
40459,Please don't buy.,40459,2
40460,I'm hope this one last better- I bought one last baseball season and after using it 4 days the lining inside ripped,40460,2
40461,I was expecting more like a sweater dress,40461,2
40462,Was very disappointed to open my package and inspect my item only to find a sewing mistake right in the front where everyone could see it.,40462,2
40462,Flimsy material.,40462,2
40462,Shoddy workmanship.,40462,2
40462,Bought this dress as a mother-of-the-bride dress for my daughter's beach side wedding ceremony.,40462,2
40462,Never wore it.,40462,2
40462,Too cheap looking.,40462,2
40462,I cannot recommend.,40462,2
40463,The only good thing about this is I got it quickly.,40463,2
40463,But the bottom is nothing like the picture I could barely get it over my hips.,40463,2
40463,"It says it's 100% cotton but the bottom part is silky, which is not what I was expecting at all.",40463,2
40463,But I guess that's what you get when ordering crap from china.,40463,2
40463,Never again.,40463,2
40464,Size chart not accurate.,40464,2
40464,They try very small.,40464,2
40465,Did not transition but was polarized.,40465,2
40465,Lenses fit well into frames.,40465,2
40466,Looks nothing like the image.,40466,2
40466,You have to keep it in direct sun for it to glow.,40466,2
40466,Low quality of the chain and pendent.,40466,2
40467,Nice build quality but SUPER small!!!,40467,2
40467,"I am a 39"" waist and thought okay people say it is small so I got a XXL and it still was so small I could just get my arms into the sleeves and couldn't even touch the zipper sides together.",40467,2
40467,I was sad because I liked how it looked.,40467,2
40468,These fit nice.,40468,2
40468,"Soft and snug, but not tight - in fact they were loose enough to ride-up on me a little bit.",40468,2
40468,They also have  less length to the legs than pictured.,40468,2
40468,I was dissapointed with how fragile they were though.,40468,2
40468,I had worn these to work and when I came home found I had somehow punctured a hole in them which made an inch long tear in the fabric.,40468,2
40468,"My work mostly entails sitting at a computer all day, so it's a mystery to me how they got damaged.",40468,2
40468,2-stars because they won't last long if they fall apart just from sitting in them all day.,40468,2
40469,"All reviews said ran small,  like most women my bust and my behind are not the same size.",40469,2
40469,To be on the safe side i bought a large.,40469,2
40469,"Well i was surprised that the bottom fit, because it looked huge and I normally will wear a medium bottom.",40469,2
40469,"However the top is padded... and somewhat adjustable but nit the padding, to describe better,  I couldn't shove them I'm without them popping out like a little bit more than a respectable mother of 2.... if I was 18 the boys would Love it!",40469,2
40469,But I'm not!,40469,2
40469,"I like the material, design, price, quality and overall product but I won't be fitting in the top anytime soon, the girls are going with standard triangles!",40469,2
40469,Probably will wear the bottom very comfortable!,40469,2
40470,"I was super happy with the size of the tank top underneath, as well as the fit of the pants on my 4yr old, although maybe they were even just slightly tighter than normal (I bought a size 5 and she wears size 4 shirt and pants).",40470,2
40470,The weird thing about this though is there isn't a zipper in the pants in the front so there is a hole in the crotch if they are tighter.,40470,2
40470,"I am totally disappointed in the size of the lace over shirt though, it looks nothing like the loose fit in the picture, it comes down only to my daughters belly button and is form fitting when it should be loose and big and flowing.",40470,2
40471,Too Big,40471,2
40472,Too large is it too late to return it ?,40472,2
40473,socks are too tight at top-hurt my legs.,40473,2
40474,They are not leggings they are tights you csnt wear them as pants and mine came with a run in the front and two runs up the back,40474,2
40475,This is an extra large shirt with a 58 chest way too big.,40475,2
40475,It need to be a 46 chest on an extra large shirt.,40475,2
40476,This dress gets 2 stars for how beautiful it is.,40476,2
40476,"However, the picture shows it as being floor length with is hardly the case unleashed you're 4 foot tall.",40476,2
40476,The dress falls mid calf at best.,40476,2
40476,Making it very difficult to find appropriate shoes.,40476,2
40477,the fit was small in the arms even though i sized up two sizes!,40477,2
40477,i am normally a medium and i ordered a XL.,40477,2
40477,the fabric isn't bad but a couple of the seams are coming undone so i will have to fix it.,40477,2
40477,so it's not super well made.,40477,2
40478,I returned this sweatshirt.,40478,2
40478,It was nothing like I expected.,40478,2
40478,I didn't care for the quality.,40478,2
40479,The sunglasses were crooked and broke within 2 weeks of me having them...a screw fell out and now the glasses are practically useless.,40479,2
40480,"The top part of this dress is way to loose, I had to take it just to get it to fit and look properly.",40480,2
40480,Larger bust won't have an issue with this dress.,40480,2
40481,Fits like a top,40481,2
40482,"Fur is beautiful, but the fit is not very snug.",40482,2
40482,"There's a small piece of elastic at the back, but that doesn't help when it's a tad too big to start.",40482,2
40482,Nice felt lining.,40482,2
40482,Nice thick weight.,40482,2
40483,this is from the giftee.,40483,2
40483,she doesn't think the quality is any good and it is not correctly sized.,40483,2
40483,I do believe she returned it.,40483,2
40484,Cute.,40484,2
40484,But it fits tight and the button holes are fake.,40484,2
40484,"So since it does not button, you can see my underwear.",40484,2
40485,I wouldn't recommend this product.,40485,2
40485,"The primary reason is because although the quality of the goods in appearance are decent and strong the actual clips, or, clasp do not hold the shirt properly.",40485,2
40485,This may have been because the shirts I was using may have not been the best material (60 cotton / 40 polyester blend ) for the clasp to stick but this is my experience.,40485,2
40485,I will not be returning the shirt stays  due to the low the cost (which I applaud for a nice attempt.),40485,2
40485,"But, I plan to either MacGyver something together with safety pins or purchase from another vendor.",40485,2
40485,"Short Story:
I was excited to receive my shirt stays but upon use I became disappointed and have I regretfully have decided to not purchase from Buttons & Pleats again.",40485,2
40486,it's cheaply made,40486,2
40487,It's impossible to see anything with these.,40487,2
40487,"All diffraction glasses cloud vision a bit, but paired with the sunglasses, they're useless.",40487,2
40487,But they do look good.,40487,2
40488,First the plus side:  It's a cute picture and soft fabric.,40488,2
40488,"The down side, it's sized for someone 5' tall and 90 pounds.",40488,2
40488,"Since I ordered an x-large, I am neither.",40488,2
40488,"Not worth sending back, I'll just give it to a petite friend.",40488,2
40489,I ordered a size Small and ended up with a medium.,40489,2
40489,"The tag said small, but the pants are actually a medium.",40489,2
40489,Really disappointed!,40489,2
40489,These pants are great but sadly not what I ordered.,40489,2
40489,won't be ordering again and I'm going to attempt to shrink them a bit.,40489,2
40490,"Design was way smaller than it appears in the picture which was disapointing, there was a smell to it when it arrived, and the material is thin.",40490,2
40490,I expected better for the cost,40490,2
40491,"Ok, this product is ok, the top looks just like a sports bra !",40491,2
40491,I have wide hips and when I put on it stretches and then looks loose on weist!,40491,2
40491,It's ok still pretty,40491,2
40492,"I was very excited about this shirt but very disappointed upon its arrival; the shirt is pretty, but runs very large and most importantly it is poorly put together: I ordered 2 white shirts and both arrived with broken shoulder seams (at the neckline).",40492,2
40492,"I ""can"" fix them and take them in (I am a seamstress), but I shouldn't have to do that.",40492,2
40492,I will be returning these items.,40492,2
40492,Would not recommend buying these unless you have a sewing machine handy and don't mind going over allll the (very poor) seamwork.,40492,2
40493,I'm pretty disappointed.,40493,2
40493,My son is tall for 7 months old so I'm used to ordering up size...,40493,2
40493,I ordered the 18m-2t thinking if it's big at least he will grow in to it... it's too small!,40493,2
40493,And it's small in a weird way bc the arms and legs would fit but the torso is too short.,40493,2
40493,"It looks different from the product description too, it's solid gray on the back and a different color blue on the front.",40493,2
40493,It's not nice enough for an event or pictures (this is like a tuxedo t shirt where it would seem sarcastic in that scenario) but if it were only cut right and big enough it would be a cute regular day outfit.,40493,2
40494,Only bottom fit..the top was too small.,40494,2
40494,I am a size 36d and I am spilling out.,40494,2
40495,"This technically ""fits"" but there's not enough stretch for a longer torso so I can't wear it.",40495,2
40495,"If you don't think you have a long torso and have a perky enough bum to pull this off, it would be cute.",40495,2
40496,Sleeves were very narrow.,40496,2
40496,Would not recommend this item.,40496,2
40496,Not sewed well.,40496,2
40497,These totally fell apart.,40497,2
40497,They are super cute but not worth the effort.,40497,2
40497,Very disappointed.,40497,2
40498,"Unfortunately, this didn't work out for me.",40498,2
40498,"The color (I ordered purple) is bright and cheerful, and the material is thick and stretchy.",40498,2
40498,"But, the torso is fairly short, and as a busty woman (30FF), the waist of this sat way too high and looked like a baby doll dress.",40498,2
40498,"I would recommend this for smaller-chested women, though!",40498,2
40499,Fits weird in the boobs,40499,2
40500,The image shown is of a pair of Vans sunglasses.,40500,2
40500,"The Neff Zeroes, while awesome in design and appearance, are too small for my head.",40500,2
40501,Small,40501,2
40502,Cheap fabric.,40502,2
40503,The flower design does not look as nice in the picture.,40503,2
40503,Not worth the money paid.,40503,2
40504,Metal very thin with sharp edges.,40504,2
40504,Stones are kinda cheap lookin and glued on.,40504,2
40504,Disappointed,40504,2
40505,Broke the 2nd time I wore it,40505,2
40506,The quality on what's expected,40506,2
40507,SEE THRU!,40507,2
40507,No way can you wear this without something underneath.,40507,2
40507,It is completely see thru.,40507,2
40507,I wouldn't have purchased had I known this as I really wanted this to be lined so that I didn't have to wear a complete camisole underneath it.,40507,2
40508,would've given maybe 4 stars but i ordered the burgundy dark olive and black combo but received navy instead of the olive.,40508,2
40508,other than that they're very warm and comfy.,40508,2
40508,does fit a bit smaller and not as slouchy as some posters have said.,40508,2
40509,"The elastic strap around the calf fits just fine, but the sock-attaching device apparently was designed for a very thin sock.",40509,2
40509,"Anything heavier than a ""dress"" sock cannot be accommodated very easily.",40509,2
40509,I wear Wellington boots with heavy wool socks.,40509,2
40509,"If I do much walking, the socks sometimes start creeping down and bunching up at the heel.",40509,2
40509,I thought these would be the solution.,40509,2
40509,Aligator clips would have worked a lot better for my situation.,40509,2
40509,"Consequently, I won't  be using these very often, if not at all.",40509,2
40509,I'm rather disappointed.,40509,2
40510,Pants were big but shirt was too small.,40510,2
40511,Cheap material.,40511,2
40512,The quality of the logo is beyond poor.,40512,2
40512,"I washed it one time, in a front load washing machine, inside out, in cold water with other shirts and socks.",40512,2
40512,Not with anything that could have possibly caused this to happen with a brand new shirt.,40512,2
40512,NASA logo is split in multiple places like it has been worn and washed several dozen times.,40512,2
40512,Unacceptably poor quality.,40512,2
40513,"Very oddly large, unless your septum is pierced very high, It will be touching your lip.",40513,2
40513,"I put it in, and the next morning I wiped my nose gently and it popped out, I have clicker septums and they do not pop out that easily, the clicker is very short and thus not secure for such a large piece.",40513,2
40513,"Additionally, after I took it off I left it at home, and I found the edge was turning.green like ashy green like that super cheap metal.",40513,2
40513,This is non surgical stainless steel and therefore I wouldn't recommend it for anybody piercing.,40513,2
40513,"I was very gentle,.I didn't use any harsh cleaners and after 8 hours of wear in my sleep and wiping it it has proven to be very cheap.",40513,2
40513,"The crystal things look nice, over it looks nice, until.it starts to peel I would not say this is safe the metal could irritate your nose or leave chips in it.",40513,2
40513,Pass on this one!!,40513,2
40513,!,40513,2
40514,I don't like the material.,40514,2
40514,It shrinks very easily and doesn't look good on.,40514,2
40514,Im returning this set!,40514,2
40515,Not what I expected,40515,2
40516,The paint chipped off soon after buying it.,40516,2
40517,The proportions seem a little off.,40517,2
40517,One sleeve is a bit longer than the other,40517,2
40518,I own several cotton Johnny O shirts but this polyester version was really disappointing.,40518,2
40518,"I bought it for a Europe vacation where we were moving around quite a bit and living out of our backpacks, thinking its lightweight, wick-away fabric would be good for a lot of walking/hiking.",40518,2
40518,It turned out to be a strangely fragile shirt.,40518,2
40518,I rubbed up against a table very gently and it caught a thread that now shows a huge line right in the middle of the front of the shirt.,40518,2
40518,"Even if that hadn't happened, it shrunk a ton on the first wash.",40518,2
40518,"Very, very disappointing, especially at the price.",40518,2
40518,I can't imagine it's good even if you're just golfing.,40518,2
40519,It was ok.,40519,2
40519,"I didn't like the way it fit in the back, and the material looks a bit cheap.",40519,2
40520,"Definitely NOT made for your tragus, which is why I purchased it.",40520,2
40520,It is giant and quite heavy as well.,40520,2
40520,Made more for a nose or nipples for sure.,40520,2
40520,Wasted my money unfortunately.,40520,2
40521,Item not what is depicted.,40521,2
40521,Sunglasses are all Grey... Not black and silver.,40521,2
40521,Also they are a rubbery material.,40521,2
40522,"The suit is pretty enough, but the bust has a really hard material in it - made me feel like I was wearing a shell bra.",40522,2
40522,The twist in the front was also a little sloppy.,40522,2
40522,"For the price I paid it wasn't worth returning, but was a little disappointed.",40522,2
40523,It took about a month to receive (didn't realize it came from China otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it).,40523,2
40523,and it looks nothing like the picture,40523,2
40524,Was very disappointed in the quality of this sweater.,40524,2
40524,One wearing resulted in pilling and bagged out look.,40524,2
40524,Ended up returning it.,40524,2
40525,"The writing is nearly invisibly faint, even after I threw the ring into a fire for a while.",40525,2
40525,"From a few feet away in normal lighting it looks like an ordinary wedding ring, which would be a useful deception if it were the true Ring of Power.",40525,2
40525,But for $8 I shouldn't complain; it's not like I gave up a finger for it...,40525,2
40526,"I'm 5'1"" , 104.5 lbs petite fit girl, these fit okay but don't plan on purchasing from seller again.",40526,2
40526,"Thin denim, and seem cheap especially for shipping,  costs etc.. you can spend same amount of $$$ and go to a discount or dept.",40526,2
40526,Store for better jeans.,40526,2
40526,1st wash even worse:(,40526,2
40527,Not terribly impressed.,40527,2
40527,"The pendant is huge and cheap-looking (the chain could be silver plated, but it doesn't look very good either) with a very obvious seam.",40527,2
40527,I meant to give this as a Christmas gift but it really is too tacky.,40527,2
40527,I guess it'll make a decent white elephant gift.,40527,2
40528,I liked the color.,40528,2
40528,The fit in the front was not as expected.,40528,2
40528,The cross over feature between the bust did not lay flat and the v-space was too deep.,40528,2
40528,I gave it to a friend with a wider chest and it seem to fit her well.,40528,2
40529,"One hat looks perfect, the other one looks like the letters are blurred.",40529,2
40529,I don't have time to return because I need the hat too soon.,40529,2
40529,The one hat that looked perfect had a dirty spot on the top of the hat.,40529,2
40529,I can get that off probably with a rag but the blurred letters on the other hat are a problem.,40529,2
40529,They came in a box that was large and they were wrapped in a plastic bag so I am not sure how one got dirty but it is aggravating that the other one is hard to read.,40529,2
40529,What's the point of the hat if you can't read it.,40529,2
40530,"Material it light and stretchy, it is see through, the sizes run extremely small, still,happy with them though, just have to lose weight",40530,2
40531,Did not fit according to size.,40531,2
40531,Disappointed.,40531,2
40532,The color isn't exactly like the picture and it was wide on me and I ordered a small.,40532,2
40533,its just ok,40533,2
40534,First off it's a two pice comes with tube top and shorts/skirt and the skirt cake pink instead of beige haven't tried on yet but looks bigger than a small.,40534,2
40535,the look nice and sturdy out of the box.,40535,2
40535,the heel hook should be sewn twisted so they will lay smooth going up your leg.,40535,2
40535,these twist up your leg as they are sewn flat,40535,2
40536,The weird thing is it looks like something you wear around the house when no one is home.,40536,2
40536,It does not close.,40536,2
40536,The picture is pretty accurate.,40536,2
40536,Except the model makes it look good.,40536,2
40537,Not what I expected,40537,2
40538,"The ad said the bandanas were double-sided, but in actuality, they are only finished on one side.",40538,2
40538,Too much trouble to send them back or I would .,40538,2
40538,.,40538,2
40538,.,40538,2
40539,Beautiful earring; I say earring because only one came.,40539,2
40540,Loose color extremely fast!,40540,2
40540,A shame cause they were so cute!,40540,2
40540,!,40540,2
40541,"I really wanted this shirt, but I think that the product pictured on this listing is different than what they actually send you.",40541,2
40541,"First of all, the fabric is thinner than the one in the picture...the picture just seems a bit more substantial, like a thicker cotton; the one they send is so thin and light.",40541,2
40541,"Second, I bought the size small (I'm about 5ft/107lbs.",40541,2
40541,"), but when I put it on, I couldn't quite understand how it fits.",40541,2
40541,"I understand that this is supposed to be an ""oversized, baggy"" shirt, but it feels and looks more like a mumu dress.",40541,2
40541,Pls.,40541,2
40541,refer to my photos for a better visual of what I'm talking about.,40541,2
40541,I'm really disappointed with this purchase.,40541,2
40541,:(,40541,2
40542,Small and cheap,40542,2
40543,I ordered a XXL and the size was more like a medium to a large.,40543,2
40543,"Gave it to a friend, waste of my money.",40543,2
40544,Returned.,40544,2
40544,Material different than expected,40544,2
40545,I purchased this bracelet for my daughter as a Christmas gift and the charms are already falling off just two weeks later.,40545,2
40546,I was disappointed with this product.,40546,2
40546,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I bought this to give as a gift and was embarrassed at the ""cheapness"" of it.",40546,2
40546,I will probably return this and will not buy from here again.,40546,2
40546,"I know it is not expensive, but I still expected a quality product and did not receive that.",40546,2
40547,would not buy again - mediocre quality - not very flattering,40547,2
40548,Nose brace fell off the first week,40548,2
40549,This product was cut small and didn't look like the picture.,40549,2
40550,I love the style of the shirt not going to lie but the material is horrible.,40550,2
40550,It's really stiff and super see through.,40550,2
40550,Very very cheaply made.,40550,2
40550,Really disappointed but you get what you pay for.,40550,2
40551,Well made but size was not true to sizing chart.,40551,2
40552,Sooo small.,40552,2
40552,This thing is like boy shorts and rides up when you walk not to mention I think the holes could be a bit bigger.,40552,2
40553,I think this would be a really cute dress if only it weren't too large.,40553,2
40553,"I am 5'1"" and weigh 110lb, and a small size was too big for me.",40553,2
40553,"I will unfortunately be returning it, although I wish I could try an extra small one.",40553,2
40554,"If you put your keys in your pocket, the zipper is going to squish and snap open and that'll be the end of that.",40554,2
40554,"For me at least, it doesn't work.",40554,2
40555,Straps are very thin,40555,2
40556,These products SNAG every easily!,40556,2
40556,I'm returning the others I purchased because my V-neck one snagged on the first day I wore it.,40556,2
40556,:(,40556,2
40557,The shirt is great except for the color.,40557,2
40557,"When the description, pic, and name say ORANGE, I shouldn't expect a light coral almost salmon color to show up.",40557,2
40558,Very dissapointed doesn't look like the picture and  made with cheap materials,40558,2
40559,"I only got 5/9 colors, the rest were duplicates.",40559,2
40559,Otherwise good quality,40559,2
40560,The reason I am giving 2 stars is simply that I had to sew up the V-back several inches to get it to stay on my shoulders.,40560,2
40560,I am also thinking of sewing the front a couple inches.,40560,2
40560,The slit in the back is simply too deep for it to stay in place.,40560,2
40560,This is a terrible design flaw.,40560,2
40560,"That said, if you have access to a needle and a little thread of whatever color you purchased, then it can be made to work and it is soft and pretty.",40560,2
40561,I thought the lens would be darker.,40561,2
40561,They are very light and your eyes are seen.,40561,2
40562,Poorly made and runs very small,40562,2
40563,Wasn't a big fan of the product.,40563,2
40563,Seemed kind of cheaply made and when I fit all my cards in it it would not fully close or it would pop back open.,40563,2
40564,The outfit was very small.,40564,2
40564,I would suggest ordering at least two sizes up.,40564,2
40564,"Also, the material is thin, so be prepared to wear something underneath to compensate.",40564,2
40565,This was more like a child's size rather than adult size.,40565,2
40565,My hat size is 7 7/8 so not unusually large.,40565,2
40565,Disappointed since the fabric is nice.,40565,2
40566,"Sizes ran EXTREMELY small, and the material is not stretchy or as flexible as the picture makes it seem.",40566,2
40566,"I have a 27 inch waist, 5ft7in height, and the biggest size they had was way too small",40566,2
40567,Too small.,40567,2
40567,"Purchased a large, am a size 11.",40567,2
40567,Returning.,40567,2
40568,Size not shown.,40568,2
40568,They're for small feet.,40568,2
40569,Length is perfect but it is to wide in comparison to other brands,40569,2
40570,You get what you pay for.,40570,2
40570,I took it out of the package and the round decorative pendant fell to the floor.,40570,2
40570,Looks very cheap and the chain is too thick which makes it cheap looking.,40570,2
40571,Not very complimentary to my body type.,40571,2
40571,"I'm 5'4.5"" and 140 lbs - very muscular.",40571,2
40571,It made me look 'fat',40571,2
40572,tarnished within a few days of wear.,40572,2
40573,Nice style but too small,40573,2
40574,This was too small and as a result not flowy at all.,40574,2
40574,It was also longer than expected coming down past mid-thigh.,40574,2
40574,"The fabric was nice though, and the color and pattern were true to the photo.",40574,2
40575,The brim is covered with a black material on the underside.,40575,2
40575,This doesn't let the air move through it and it was extremely hot.,40575,2
40576,"These HDE hose were supposed to be ""Tall"" but they are definetly not Tall at all.",40576,2
40576,A Disappointment.,40576,2
40576,Wouldn't purchase again.,40576,2
40577,Very small and not what I expected.,40577,2
40578,The shirt faded after the first wash.,40578,2
40578,"I originally purchased for my unborn baby boy, but ended up putting it on my one year old girl since it was so large.",40578,2
40579,"It's pretty pattern, it's warm.",40579,2
40579,Found the material a little too snug and the sleeves are short.,40579,2
40579,Cuff didn't come to my wrist with some wiggle room which is what I like,40579,2
40580,Broke the first week.,40580,2
40581,2 sizes too small.,40581,2
40581,"Ordered XL, got XL, fits like a Med",40581,2
40582,Poor quality bag,40582,2
40583,The top runs very small,40583,2
40584,It's very pretty but the fit is very small.,40584,2
40584,I'll be sending it back.,40584,2
40585,"Cute swimsuit, however very poor quality.",40585,2
40586,"I ordered the X-Large, and it was still small and tight.",40586,2
40586,It also arrived extremely wrinkly and my overall experience was disappointing.,40586,2
40586,"NOT worth the price I paid, even if it was a small price.",40586,2
40587,"Top part is ok,but bottom part is narrow.",40587,2
40587,"Picture looks like A-line skirts,but it's just tight skirts.",40587,2
40588,The Headband wasn't the same as in the picture.,40588,2
40589,"The color was off,it wasn't the same as the picture",40589,2
40590,Turned my belly button green did not enjoy that but is still cute,40590,2
40591,"Chain ""broke me out' within 10 minutes of wearing!",40591,2
40591,!,40591,2
40592,Disappointed.,40592,2
40592,"I didn't expect much for such an inexpensive costume, but the sleeves came with black stains all over them (possibly bleeding from the vest?).",40592,2
40592,It should at least be clean.,40592,2
40592,"As an aside, the hat is pretty bad and the red sashes aren't the same color as the red skirt.",40592,2
40592,"I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs.",40592,2
40592,and the Small/Medium was somewhat large on me.,40592,2
40592,I would have kept it and worn it without a hat if it hadn't had stains all over the sleeves.,40592,2
40593,The dress didn't fit.,40593,2
40593,They really should do normal US sizing.,40593,2
40593,"I was most concerned about my waist area, so I only measured there.",40593,2
40593,It fit in the waist ... but not around my chest.,40593,2
40593,"I typically wear a large (5'5"" - 165ish lbs) and I ordered the XXL.",40593,2
40593,"To be honest, I did find the fabric flimsy, but for the price, I would have kept it had it fit.",40593,2
40593,The butterflies really are adorable.,40593,2
40593,If only I could find this pattern in a normal sized dress...,40593,2
40594,Wow!,40594,2
40594,I ordered two sizes up and it was still tight at the shoulders and flattened the boobs tremendously.,40594,2
40594,I loved the print online but this shirt is entirely too snug.,40594,2
40595,Not over the knee as posted.,40595,2
40595,Below knee fit and very loose.,40595,2
40595,Very ltitle shape to the socks.,40595,2
40595,Over priced for how loose they are.,40595,2
40595,Only really good thing is that they are warm,40595,2
40596,It looks nice I've ordered a size 9 and I got a small size look like size 6,40596,2
40597,small,40597,2
40598,"Doesn't look anything like the picture... it hits way to high and not on the waist, which isn't very flattering.",40598,2
40598,It was also a lot smaller than I'd expected it to be.,40598,2
40598,I will never wear it but it wasn't worth the price of sending it back.,40598,2
40598,Another casualty of online shopping I guess!,40598,2
40599,"Two stars because it is adorable and well made,  but this hat was so huge that my two year old ended up wearing it, not my two week old- even after a wash with hot water and a high heat dry.",40599,2
40600,Feel very light and kind of cheap- pretty color though,40600,2
40601,These run incredibly small,40601,2
40602,Not the same as the picture.,40602,2
40602,"The fabric is very thin & the stitching came out on day two, so pockets are coming off.",40602,2
40603,It feels like plastic,40603,2
40604,"Love the style, but changed color after I wore it few times",40604,2
40605,Way too small and very low cut.,40605,2
40605,Did not fit like the model shown.,40605,2
40606,Is much smaller than photos lead you to believe,40606,2
40607,I normally wear 8.5 - 9.0 US size.,40607,2
40607,Ordered these pairs in 43 and they fit nicely with arch support.,40607,2
40607,My problem is with the pedals.,40607,2
40607,There are two adjustment screws on each pedal and the smaller one on the side would not move when trying to unscrewed.,40607,2
40607,The hex head is busted easily.,40607,2
40607,Now it won't come out at all.,40607,2
40607,I am returning them.,40607,2
40608,"Ran 2 sizes too small, cute shirt though.",40608,2
40609,Too short and transparent,40609,2
40610,I don't like the material.,40610,2
40611,I bought my son this swim diaper because he has a swim class coming up and they require that he wears a reusable one.,40611,2
40611,"In the mean time, we ran out of disposables and I thought ""why buy more diapers just for water play when we have this one?""",40611,2
40611,So he has worn it twice to the spray park.,40611,2
40611,Both times his inner thighs have become chafed by the wet diaper rubbing against them.,40611,2
40611,The first time the burns didn't seem that bad so I gave it another chance yesterday.,40611,2
40611,I am so mad that I did.,40611,2
40611,Last night I had to slather his legs in aquaphor just so he could walk comfortably.,40611,2
40611,I can't curse this thing enough.,40611,2
40611,"We'll keep it because it is required for his class, but once something makes my baby cry it's on my s--tlist.",40611,2
40612,Actually a little harder to see at night,40612,2
40613,It's wrong size too large for,40613,2
40614,too small for USA sizes.,40614,2
40614,"Made of very high quality sewing with zipper end protectors, double fabric makes up the entire garment.",40614,2
40614,Good quality elastic used for entire bra.,40614,2
40614,The colours are very fresh and this bra could be worn as a garment to exercise in or just look pretty in.,40614,2
40614,The size issue is they are too small for size 36 - 38 which is considered XL.,40614,2
40614,This is a great deal for small sized women.,40614,2
40615,"Material is comfy, but fit is awkward.",40615,2
40615,The straps will not stay on my shoulders.,40615,2
40615,"The pads are very small and don't cover even half, but at least they're removable.",40615,2
40616,I order this in Extra small but it fits like a size small/medium.,40616,2
40616,I really wish It was a true extra small because I really like this dress.,40616,2
40617,If you have a booty go a size up.,40617,2
40617,Obviously made for girls with no rear.,40617,2
40617,Super tight in the back.,40617,2
40617,Other hand love the look of them.,40617,2
40618,"No adjustment straps, fits very awkwardly",40618,2
40619,"Looks very nice, but fell apart after one week.",40619,2
40620,"VERY DISAPPOINTED DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE WHAT IS SHOWN,ALSO TOO SMALL",40620,2
40621,I ordered up 2 sizes and this dress is still to small!!!,40621,2
40621,It's too bad that is doesn't fit because the color is perfect and the dress itself is adorable.,40621,2
40622,Half of the snaps fell off the first time I wore it when I want to take it off.,40622,2
40622,Super cute if the snaps had stayed on.,40622,2
40622,Now it's just trash.,40622,2
40622,"Also, if you're taller than 5' 2"" you don't want this, I'm 5' 0"" and the length is perfect, I can imagine it would ride up really bad if you're not super short.",40622,2
40623,Not crazy about the quality,40623,2
40624,The posts are too small and don't have the right seat for the backs.,40624,2
40624,Both backs have fallen off and now I can't wear them bc of how small the posts are.,40624,2
40625,I I like the style but the quality is cheap,40625,2
40626,"Ordered a Large and got a top that was a small (tag said S), and skirt tag said L, but was  way too small.",40626,2
40627,quality is very low.,40627,2
40627,the cz is good as others but the setting is not.,40627,2
40627,the post is not in the center.,40627,2
40627,I return it.,40627,2
40628,This didn't come with a dark lens as shown and as I expected it to..,40628,2
40628,It came with a yellow lens.,40628,2
40628,I gave them away.,40628,2
40629,This shirts material is really weird.,40629,2
40629,Its almost like a rain coat material... it also did not fit well at all.,40629,2
40629,It was really baggy and not flattering at all.,40629,2
40630,Here is the problem with shopping on Amazon.,40630,2
40630,"You find things that have decent reviews and are super cute, but when it arrives it is cheap and terribly made.",40630,2
40630,I had my pair for not even fourteen hours when I went to put them on and the side of the glasses broke off!,40630,2
40630,"It's not a user error, just really poor craftsmanship and materials.",40630,2
40630,I am so disappointed.,40630,2
40631,"Top part that is black is shorter in person not like the picture, the ""studs"" are stickers and falls off on the slightest touch.",40631,2
40631,Good for a use or two.,40631,2
40632,Did not fit well.,40632,2
40632,Slides down on my face.,40632,2
40632,But I did like style and softness and color,40632,2
40633,"Cheap Material, Wore it once and it already has a hole in it.",40633,2
40633,It is a very cute top though,40633,2
40634,I ORDERED AN XTRA LARGE.,40634,2
40634,MORE LIKE AN XTRA SMALL.,40634,2
40635,Literally broke within a week just from being on my face.,40635,2
40635,"I don't have the widest head in the world at all, but I guess the strain from the ear oieces being slightly pulled apart is too much for these cheap shades.",40635,2
40635,Ridiculous.,40635,2
40636,This lower priced version is not as good as the original.,40636,2
40636,"The groove is not as deep and the bands don't stay on it, even brand new ones.",40636,2
40636,"I bought the original when it came out last year, but after 6 months the rose gold finished chipped  away.",40636,2
40636,"I thought I would get this cheaper version and then wouldn't care as much that I had to replace a couple times a year, but it isn't as good as the patented one.",40636,2
40637,"I'm an athletic 5'4"" 160 lb frame.",40637,2

40639,"Too short of a fit vertically, need to grab next size up.",40639,2
40640,This is way to small for my ear and also very heavy so it doesn't fit me at all.,40640,2
40641,Still cute.,40641,2
40641,Much smaller than I expected.,40641,2
40642,Pretty sad donut costume.,40642,2
40642,Looks like the picture but doesn't really hold it's shape and back is loose tan cloth.,40642,2
40643,size not correct the large is a small,40643,2
40644,This bag is basically a wallet.,40644,2
40644,The proportions (despite measurements) on the image with the model are pretty different.,40644,2
40644,The wallet is indeed very shallow and flimsy.,40644,2
40644,"Nice leather, but not worth price tag.",40644,2
40644,Will be returning.,40644,2
40645,Quality of hoodie is ok but the quality of the graphics is appalling.,40645,2
40645,It literally feels like a home-made school project using an iron-on product you buy from the craft store.,40645,2
40645,"The ""image"" looks like a photocopy at best.",40645,2
40645,I have requested a refund and to date have received 2 replies in broken English and incomplete sentences with absolutely no information on making a return.,40645,2

40650,"see thru, I cant wear it in public",40650,2
40651,I love the way this band fit and felt.,40651,2
40651,"However, only 2 months in, and the bar holding the latch to the leather band will not stay on.",40651,2
40651,"every other day my watch will fall off my wrist and i will need to screw the latch back in, it never really becoming tight again.",40651,2
40651,this was a waste of money and i am now in the market for a new watch band...,40651,2
40652,Ok,40652,2
40653,I thought I had ordered an XL but when I checked it was a L and they don't appear to make an XL - too bad as it is a great looking shirt and well made.,40653,2
40653,If it had fit I would have given it 5 stars - as it is I have to rate it at 2.,40653,2
40654,925 is supposed to mean that it's sterling silver and now where did the product description say that it was plated.,40654,2
40654,I wore it 6 times in the last 3 weeks and it's already looking terrible with the silver not looking right....EXTREMLY disappointed.,40654,2
40655,"When I first saw this dress, I fell in love...",40655,2
40655,I had to have it...and I was sad how it was actually  built.,40655,2
40655,I normally wear a size 10 but from the reviews and measurements I ordered up.,40655,2
40655,"The dress was too small to even zip up, but even if it did zip up the lace under the arm pits were scrachy and the chest part of the dress made thinks look...pointy.",40655,2
40655,I'm 36D and it made if look like I had odd shaped cones stuffed down the dress.,40655,2
40655,There is a very hard corset/built in bra(?),40655,2
40655,in the front.,40655,2
40655,I really wanted to love this dress....but I sent it back,40655,2
40656,The symbols on the headphones near the microphone are in another language so I'll never know what they mean.. the sound quality is horrible and the microphone works when it wants to,40656,2
40657,"Soft and comfortable, but completely different from the style I ordered (and uglier in my opinion) I ordered the pink dress with geo design and got this...",40657,2
40658,Way too small and you have to lace it your self.... it is sheer but it is nice I just can't  get in it,40658,2

40664,"The width of the product is fine, if you're about 5'3"".",40664,2
40664,"At 5'8"", they were really short.",40664,2
40665,Kind of lost its shape after a few uses and is just too small to fit well.,40665,2
40665,"Not really a proper flat brim snapback in my opinion, the bill is too small for one...",40665,2
40666,Way too large and is very cheap material.,40666,2
40666,"Don't go with size recommendations, they're incorrect!",40666,2
40667,I bought a size larger than normal.,40667,2
40667,They would not stay pulled up.,40667,2
40667,I had a gap in my crotch area all the time and I only wore them around the house.,40667,2
40667,I am returning them.,40667,2
40668,Did not fit well or look as expected.,40668,2
40669,Not as pictured.,40669,2
40669,"It's very poor quality, extremely thin.",40669,2
40669,Fits awkward.,40669,2
40669,I tried it on but never actually wore it as it looked nothing like the picture.,40669,2
40669,"The picture looks like a nice cozy sweater, this is not it.",40669,2
40669,I was extremely disappointed.,40669,2
40669,This is definitely not the sweater shown.,40669,2
40669,I have found the actual sweater shown for a few hundred dollars.,40669,2
40669,"Not willing to pay that much, but I did find it on a reputable US site.",40669,2
40669,I hoped that since this was on amazon it would have been better quality.,40669,2
40669,Oh well.,40669,2
40670,Heavy and cheap looking.,40670,2
40670,Disappointed.,40670,2
40671,awkward fit.,40671,2
40671,Pants tight in weird places.,40671,2
40671,Jacket fits fine Pants too uncomfortable to wear,40671,2
40672,Feel apart the moment my GF wore it.,40672,2
40673,"The cups are seriously padded, and the foam is extremely dense and rigid.",40673,2
40673,"The cups are oddly shaped, with the top edges pushing down which creates that weird quad -boob effect.",40673,2
40673,The bottoms had very little elastic range.,40673,2
40673,You gain maybe 3 inches when stretched to the max.,40673,2
40673,"So if you have wide thighs/hips and a narrow waste, you won't be able to get the right size on.",40673,2
40673,Sending it back.,40673,2
40674,"Came wayyyyy to small, size up by 2 or three.",40674,2
40675,So cute but not true to size.,40675,2
40675,Ran very small,40675,2
40676,Sadly the paint was coming off where the band meets the face of the watch.,40676,2
40676,It is pretty but the details look cheaply made.,40676,2
40677,Okay these pants are adorable.,40677,2
40677,But beware of size.,40677,2
40677,I ordered a large and they are more like an extra small.,40677,2
40678,Sheds a ton!,40678,2
40678,My floor is covered in white feathers and the boa isn't even all the way out of the plastic packaging yet.,40678,2
40678,:(,40678,2
40679,"I bought this for my daughter, it was somewhat smaller than expected and felt cheep.",40679,2
40679,She did not end up wearing it she sold it to a resale shop.,40679,2
40680,Tried one in the store and bought it online but it was a different  kind of shoe .,40680,2
40680,"Too big , different fit !",40680,2
40681,The dress is too short!,40681,2
40681,It's so unfortunate because it is really beautiful but I'm only 5'5'' and it barely reaches the floor without heels.,40681,2
40681,It also runs small.,40681,2
40681,I'm 125 lbs  34C and it fits snug around breast area.,40681,2
40682,Too large.,40682,2
40682,I typed in kids size and they sent men size.,40682,2
40683,I bought these for my husband but they are the size of children's sunglasses.,40683,2
40683,Way too small.,40683,2
40684,Marked as genuine leather.,40684,2
40684,"In my opinion, it does not have the quality as a real leather.",40684,2
40685,So incredibly small.,40685,2
40685,"The fabric is also really thin, so plan on wearing a layer under.",40685,2
40686,I read the reviews about this bathing suit before I bought it and understood that it ran small.,40686,2
40686,I am 5'10 and 120lbs.,40686,2
40686,"I ordered their ""medium"" which is apparently between sizes (12-14).",40686,2
40686,It was most definitely not.,40686,2
40686,I should've ordered the large and who knows if that would even fit me.,40686,2
40686,Don't buy less than a medium unless you are a child...,40686,2
40687,"The dress in the website looks nice,and the design is small,the one I received the design is bigger and the way the skirt part was cut was not circular.",40687,2
40687,They are not the same in the picture.i return mine.i bought it because if how it looks in the picture .,40687,2
40688,The colors look nothing like the picture.,40688,2
40688,And the top is too big and loose at the straps.,40688,2
40689,too big,40689,2
40690,Very thin,40690,2
40691,This is one of the dumbest purchases I've ever made.,40691,2
40691,"If I hadn't been overseas and had it brought to me, I would have certainly returned it.",40691,2
40691,"First of all, I followed the sizing chart and it was too big.",40691,2
40691,Not extremely so I was able to use it but it did a pretty terrible job of hiding my open zipper.,40691,2
40691,"A friend of mine who I showed it to said ""Why did you just buy a cheap spandex miniskirt.",40691,2
40691,::::facepalm:::  Omg why didn't I think of that???,40691,2
40691,?,40691,2
40692,"I was really excited for these leggings and then I finally get them in today, and they're purple.",40692,2
40692,I ordered the 004 which is definitely blue in the picture and these are not blue.,40692,2
40692,"Pretty sure they sent me the wrong color and now it's too late to get a new pair in before Halloween, thus, ruining my costume.",40692,2
40692,At least they're cute.,40692,2
40693,"Product scratched, dusty, charger carelessly dumped in box.",40693,2
40693,Old or returned item most likely.,40693,2
40693,Works well enough for a pre-owned item charged at full price.,40693,2
40694,It is too small.,40694,2
40694,I cannot use it,40694,2
40695,"poor quality,",40695,2
40696,Cheap cheap cheap,40696,2
40697,The colors and fit are accurate but the fabric is like a cross between a plastic table cloth and those capes you wear when you get your hair cut.,40697,2
40697,It's shiny and plasticy and loud when you move.,40697,2
40697,I took a chance knowing the price may indicate quality and this risk did not pay off.,40697,2
40697,In another fabric this would be really pretty.,40697,2
40697,This is going straight to the donation pile.,40697,2
40697,I don't recommend at all.,40697,2
40698,They look great but they are way to small for a man arms,40698,2
40699,Its pretty although kind of small and the colors are not the same as in the picture,40699,2
40700,The shoulders on this shirt are huge.,40700,2
40700,It's also incredibly long.,40700,2
40700,"Fits through torso and hips, but shoulders are so big and loose that this sits like an 'off the shoulder' top and exposes my bra straps at all times.",40700,2
40700,"Also, I know the buttons are supposed to be off center, but when wearing the shirt they just look crooked...like an irregular item.",40700,2
40701,"made of very cheap material, thinner than I thought.",40701,2
40701,"The ribbons are a shiny, tacky cheap ass 1 dollar ribbons you can get at the dollar store.",40701,2
40701,Where's the quality?,40701,2
40701,I paid like a $100 dollars for this.,40701,2
40701,"There was no packaging to speak of either, it arrived in a clear plastic baggie.",40701,2
40701,"What the.... You can still lace up with it and use it but for the price, this is outrageous.",40701,2
40701,what a markup.,40701,2
40702,I'm sure I can make it work somehow but very disappointed with the quality.,40702,2
40702,Of course I'm ordering clothing from other countries off of Amazon so you can't expect top notch but this?,40702,2
40702,Couldn't have costed more than 5 cents to make...,40702,2
40703,"The material is very thin and doesn't work for a curvy shape, only because if it has to stretch, it fades the words and color.",40703,2
40704,They won't let me post my true review so I'll water it down.,40704,2
40704,No zipper.,40704,2
40704,Pull over head and it gets difficult to get past chest.,40704,2
40704,After you go through that it fits a bit snug in chest area if you are more plush in that area.,40704,2
40704,Still nice.,40704,2
40704,Keeping it.,40704,2
40704,The shipping lowered it another star.,40704,2
40704,Major headache.,40704,2
40705,"My daughter likes it , I however thought it was too tight and I felt restricted .",40705,2
40705,I wish the satin life cap came in more sizes .,40705,2
40705,It does have the adjustable strap but it's only for the sides .,40705,2
40706,Chain broke when I put the necklace on.,40706,2
40707,the tank top itself fits as I expected but the bust area does not effectively cover.,40707,2
40707,I wear a size 36 DD,40707,2
40708,Two small,40708,2
40709,"The purse is pretty, however, the main zipper tassle fell off immediately, and the zipper itself also gets stuck on the inside material.",40709,2
40709,"Also, the pockets on the inside for cell, etc are too close to the top so everything falls right out of the pockets.",40709,2
40709,I would not recommend.,40709,2
40710,It's too short.,40710,2
40710,Unflattering.,40710,2
40711,They've fallen apart in less then 2 months.,40711,2
40712,Somewhat small around the waist line and the breasts are spaced too far apart for a normal fat person.,40712,2
40713,To hard to release,40713,2
40714,The boot smells it has a odor to it as if gasoline was something was used in making it it had the whole box melon I put the box in my closet and it made my clothes smell the shoes look okay but the oldest from the shoe is horrible,40714,2
40715,The colors are not as bright as pictured.,40715,2
40715,The overall look of the dress was much duller in person so I returned it.,40715,2
40715,The fit was nice though so I wish the fabric was better.,40715,2
40716,I returned the product after holes formed after one or two uses,40716,2
40717,Too small all it offer was size 11 that was the largest offered,40717,2
40718,"I love the colors , but when I open it one stone had fallen off.",40718,2
40718,Disappointed.,40718,2
40719,"I went by the size chart and ordered a medium, which was supposed to be a size 5.",40719,2
40719,"The tag in the one I got says 24months, 2T, 3T",40719,2
40720,"Love the colors and the style, but ordered two sizes larger than I normally would, and still too small.",40720,2
40720,Very disappointed.,40720,2
40721,I don't love this costume...,40721,2
40721,I ordered a large thinking the shirt was seperate from the actual jacket and i was annoyed when i opened it and found it was sewn together....,40721,2
40721,I recommend finding a different costume if you look for quality because not only was it a little snug it was so beyond itchy i had to take it off right away.....,40721,2
40721,I was looking forward to using this for a convention but I went out and bought a different shirt so i can change it a bit.,40721,2
40722,Awkwardly shaped.,40722,2
40722,Bad sears -- saggy in areas.,40722,2
40722,The back is cute but I don't think I'll every wear this due to it's malfunctions.,40722,2
40723,Waaay different than pictured.,40723,2
40723,"Much smaller than in person, cannot even be used as a cute purse because of the awkward size/ lack of structure.",40723,2
40723,I ended up donating mine to Goodwill.,40723,2
40723,"Took a long time to ship and arrive, then I was disappointed with it when I got it.",40723,2
40723,I would not recommend this at all!,40723,2
40724,Way too small for size requested.,40724,2
40725,It goes rusty after a month or two.,40725,2
40726,"Very disappointed, very very irregulR!",40726,2
40726,Unwearable,40726,2
40727,I was disappointed.,40727,2
40727,They are certainly not polished and are not very substantial at all.,40727,2
40727,The metal is kind of thin and gives the impression that they won't last too long.,40727,2
40727,The only reason I didn't returned them is that it would probably would cost as much to ship them back as I paid for them.,40727,2
40727,Will not recommend,40727,2
40728,This is not true tshirt material.,40728,2
40728,"It's an odd, almost sports jersey material.",40728,2
40728,"On closer look the main photo is altered, the number has been cut and pasted onto an image of a navy tshirt.",40728,2
40728,The detail photos show the difference in fabric.,40728,2
40728,It's almost slick like an Under Armor material.,40728,2
40728,Also VERY large.,40728,2
40728,Returned.,40728,2
40729,Broke quickly,40729,2
40730,Too small,40730,2
40731,I didn't like the fabric,40731,2
40732,Too large for my head,40732,2
40733,Very nice but the clip fell off!,40733,2
40734,To small,40734,2
40735,Fabric is very thin and very clingy.,40735,2
40735,I did not like it.,40735,2
40736,This looks gorgeous in the picture.,40736,2
40736,"It doesn't drape the same and the ""pockets"" are super shallow and I can barely tuck my fingers in them.",40736,2
40736,It looks more like an ill fitted shirt.,40736,2
40737,I have been wearing these earrings for about a month.,40737,2
40737,"They look good, but one off the pearls fell off already!",40737,2
40738,Very cute but gloves didn't last ten minutes.,40738,2
40738,The fingers became unraveled on the first wear.,40738,2
40739,Cheap for the price.,40739,2
40739,Will return.,40739,2
40740,This dress is beautiful however it runs EXTREMELY small.,40740,2
40740,I ordered it for a wedding and now I need to return it to get something a lot bigger.,40740,2
40741,Stitching was messed up and it was very small.,40741,2
40742,"Unfortunately, these shoes were too small for my daughter.",40742,2
40742,I will be sending them back.,40742,2
40743,"Took a chance on this, considering here were no customer reviews which is usually how I decide on an order.",40743,2
40743,"I ordered an XL, because of the ""Chinese sizing"" when I usually wear a medium top/large bottoms (I'm 5'6 btw).",40743,2
40743,Fit well except for the length.,40743,2
40743,"I would have had to be about 6"" shorter to tie the straps.",40743,2
40743,I wouldn't recommend buying this suit.,40743,2
40743,"It was cute, but the sizing is all kinds of messed up.",40743,2
40744,I don't like the way it fits.,40744,2
40745,"Giving two stars because of two things, first the shirt itself is good quality.",40745,2
40745,"The second thing is that the printing seems like good quality too, awesome!",40745,2
40745,Thanks for that much.,40745,2
40745,The reason why it isn't getting the other 3 stars is because the Air Assault badge was printed on slightly crooked!,40745,2
40745,"I am a veteran, I was Air Assault qualified.",40745,2
40745,"When I pinned that badge to my uniform everyday it was straight, not only because the army regulation said it had to be, but because of my pride in how I wore the things that I earned.",40745,2
40745,Unless this can be fixed I will leave my two star rating and probably shop elsewhere for things like this.,40745,2
40746,"Beautiful dress, looks just like the picture but size was wayyyyy too small.",40746,2
40747,Still to big for my head.,40747,2
40748,"I was excited when the BTS hoodie arrived, as I put it on it looked somewhat small, and as well bit tight taking off.",40748,2
40749,they stretch out after the 4th time wearing it and then it just hangs around your neck,40749,2
40750,I do not include the box necklace,40750,2
40751,too small,40751,2
40752,Returned too small.,40752,2
40752,No issues in returning.,40752,2
40753,Poor workmanship.,40753,2
40753,Misaligned lace and skipped stitches.,40753,2
40753,Not true sizing was extremely small for an XL.,40753,2
40753,Maybe in a child's sizing.,40753,2
40754,Not flattering.,40754,2
40754,"I buy all kinds of cutout lingerie, and love mesh, as it is generally very flattering to my full figured body.",40754,2
40754,"This, however, is not.",40754,2
40754,"I might wear this as a swimsuit cover, but nothing really sexy about it..I know, it looks like it would be very sexy, but nah.",40754,2
40755,I returned the product.,40755,2
40755,"The fabric felt cheap and thin on this color, almost see through.",40755,2
40755,I have purchased several other pairs in other colors from Amazon but and was very happy but these were a let down.,40755,2
40756,The sleeves are shorter then expected.,40756,2
40756,Tight fit around the neck.,40756,2
40756,The pockets are just for looks because normal size hands don't fit in them.,40756,2
40756,The neck is more in the middle then to the side.,40756,2
40756,More of a solid black color.,40756,2
40756,It's cute for a very light weight over shirt for nights in the summer.,40756,2
40756,"The emblem is kind of weird also, kind of devilish meets transformers.",40756,2
40757,looks nothing like the picture...material is all prom- ish from the 80's,40757,2
40758,Opened the package and was confused it was so large I thought I ordered plus size on accident!,40758,2
40758,"Based on other reviews I ordered one size up, my advice, don't.",40758,2
40758,Look at the description there's like.,40758,2
40758,"4 in diff in all the measurements which is a lot I was surprised, now returning and debating if I should even try a smaller size",40758,2
40759,Very disappointed with how small it is.,40759,2
40759,It is an XL and I think it was made to fit a 100 # person,40759,2
40760,This item does not really run true to size.,40760,2
40760,I ordered an XL in account of being post-partum.,40760,2
40760,I'm normally an L/XL in any case.,40760,2
40760,This garment fit like a medium.,40760,2
40760,The sleeves are very short and didn't even really come to my wrist.,40760,2
40760,The fabric is really thin and feels cheap.,40760,2
40760,I bought 2 hoping I'd love them based on the reviews I read.,40760,2
40760,I am returning both.,40760,2
40760,The only good thing I can say is they were shipped promptly and the colors were true to what the site stays,40760,2
40761,The dress was too small and i ordered a bigger size.,40761,2
40761,"Also, the material was a bad quality..",40761,2
40761,I had to throw it away,40761,2
40762,TOO SMALL AND IS NOT COTTON,40762,2
40763,They are sheer and were not advertised as so.,40763,2
40763,More of a tight then a leggin.,40763,2
40764,The outfit is cute but it's a 1 piece and not a 2 piece like they advertise.,40764,2
40765,too big I bought for my son and it is way to big and it is made from this cheap costume-y material so I sent it back.,40765,2
40766,ti is a nice girly top.. made of soft and thin fabric.,40766,2
40766,I return mine because.... not my type,40766,2
40767,I hate this shirt.,40767,2
40767,Its wayyyy too small and it looks like s*** on,40767,2
40768,"It's very cute , In order the biggest size and it's still small ..",40768,2
40768,I wear a medium so I order extra large .. the arms area is very tight .,40768,2
40769,The material was stiff and heavy.,40769,2
40769,I returned it.,40769,2
40769,:(,40769,2
40770,Poor fitting,40770,2
40771,THE MATERIAL IS NOT AS DESCRIBED.,40771,2
40771,AND ITS LARGER THAN EXPECTED SO IT DOESN'T SIT ON MY CHEST.,40771,2
40771,I HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING IT TOGETHER.,40771,2
40772,Delivered early.,40772,2
40772,Great designed.,40772,2
40772,I buy swim suites separate because I am smaller on top.,40772,2
40772,It fits great on the bottom.,40772,2
40772,I will have to get the top altered.,40772,2
40772,As soon as I got out if the water my husband told me that he could totally see through.,40772,2
40772,I got the black and white stripes.,40772,2
40772,It could be of a thicker material.,40772,2
40772,I am debating if I should get it alter or just toss it.,40772,2
40772,I loved the design it just need to be made with better materials.,40772,2
40773,"I wanted to find a product that's higher quality than the $5 best seller necklace display they have here on Amazon, so I went with this one thinking it'd be great.",40773,2
40773,I currently paid about $14 for this and it sure was disappointing.,40773,2
40773,"Like another user wrote, this thing is pretty cheaply made.",40773,2
40773,"It's like hard cardboard or plastic with some smooth ""leatherette"" fabric stretched over the frame.",40773,2
40773,The base is also a light material.,40773,2
40773,My fabric came creased around the neck area because it was glued or sewn incorrectly.,40773,2
40773,So beware that it isn't a solid structure but actually hallow inside where the material is stretched taut.,40773,2
40773,There was also areas of white glue(?),40773,2
40773,or paint residue on the surface I couldn't wipe off with water.,40773,2
40773,I don't want to be one of people who give a bad review because they had unreasonable expectations for their low cost purchase but I honestly think the quality of this thing doesn't reflect the cost.,40773,2
40774,Too tight a fit for me.,40774,2
40775,"Arrived looking ""antiqued"".",40775,2
40775,There were visible splotches of black wash on the dinosaur's back.,40775,2
40775,"Made the ""shiny gold"" look far cheaper.",40775,2
40775,"The gold also seemed more dull than comparable products (I ordered three different ""shiny gold"" animal wrap rings).",40775,2
40776,The blouse is just as pretty as described.,40776,2
40776,I ordered an extra large and although the tag does say XL it must be no larger than a medium.,40776,2
40776,I can't get it on at all and I wear L or XL normally.,40776,2
40776,It came on time with no issues.,40776,2
40777,Couldn't get it positioned right.,40777,2
40777,Tried it for a long flight (in coach) from Chicago to Tokyo.,40777,2
40777,It just didn't work for me.,40777,2
40778,The product arrived quickly!,40778,2
40778,"Love all the tongue rings, but this is my second tongue piercing and the 5/8 size for the bar was way too small.",40778,2
40778,I wore a new one for one day and could not take it!,40778,2
40778,"It felt like I was biting my tongue every time I flexed it, my tongue hurt when I was eating and even sleeping!",40778,2
40778,Very disappointed that I had to return the item.,40778,2
40778,I am not sure why people recommend to get 5/8 when you go from a 22mm tongue bar to a 16mm tongue bar.,40778,2
40779,"Sorry, but the girl in this picture must be 4' and 60 lbs soaking wet.",40779,2
40779,"This shirt is very small for a ""one size"" type deal.",40779,2
40779,I gave it to my 12yr old daughter.,40779,2
40780,Although these have Velcro straps if you tighten them you run out of Velcro.,40780,2
40780,Really can't be adjusted to fit.,40780,2
40780,Not fabulously comfortable.,40780,2
40780,Got them to relieve the pain in my heal and it's not working.,40780,2
40781,i ordered a large and it fitted way to small!,40781,2
40781,I followed the size chart but was still way to small for me,40781,2
40782,"These were very small, felt like they were falling down a lot.",40782,2
40783,i returned the pants,40783,2
40784,too big,40784,2
40785,"I LOVED it and it fits great, but like many others are saying it is not the color or lace design pictured and described.",40785,2
40785,Giving it two stars simply for that fact even though I do love it and have already worn it several times.,40785,2
40786,I like the dress it fits comfortable but the chest area is WAY TOO tight!,40786,2
40786,its and XL.,40786,2
40786,I have to return on sell it so I am not excited about that but overall it is pretty.,40786,2
40787,"Returned, did not fit and did not look at all like the picture.",40787,2
40787,I normally where a medium and ordered an Extra large looking at other reviews.,40787,2
40787,"It was pretty in the package, just not for me.",40787,2
40788,Cheaply made thin cotton.,40788,2
40788,Simply not the JMS panties I had always purchased.,40788,2
40788,"None of these are identical in size or fit, nor are they the lace-look pattern advertised.",40788,2
40788,They are obviously seconds and not worth the effort to return.,40788,2
40788,"Instead, I will donate them to the women's shelter locally.",40788,2
40788,JMS has lost a two-decades-plus customer!,40788,2
40788,Save your money and look elsewhere--these aren't the panties you remember...,40788,2
40789,Mask is too big.,40789,2
40789,Doesn't look like the photo.,40789,2
40790,Top fit great.,40790,2
40790,Bottom not so much.,40790,2
40790,If you have curves this isn't the right fit.,40790,2
40790,I used the top with a different bikini bottom.,40790,2
40791,Runs small.,40791,2
40791,I'll wear it as a top.,40791,2
40791,Love the color though!,40791,2
40792,For $15.99 for a pack of 12 pairs I expected these to have the rubber grip on the heal part to keep from slipping.,40792,2
40792,"But these do not, within a few feet of walking these slipped right off the back of my foot.",40792,2
40792,"I put them back on and kept going and again, slipped right off.",40792,2
40792,I haven't been wearing these for even 30mins and I'm switching them to cheap ones I bought at the shoe store that have the rubber grip.,40792,2
40792,It's essential.,40792,2
40793,The charms are super huge and mine fell apart,40793,2
40794,TOO SMALL Not true to size,40794,2
40795,The color wasn't quite as expected.,40795,2
40795,It looked dull compared to the picture!,40795,2
40796,Did not like how it fit or design.,40796,2
40797,They were about 2 sizes smaller then the real size 11.,40797,2
40797,They were very cute but we had to send them back because the size was so off.,40797,2
40798,Too small and the belt was missing,40798,2
40799,"Within one month of purchase, the strap was more than halfway detached, and the main zipper broke.. my second purchase of this brand,  didn't have an issue the first time.",40799,2
40800,Cheap and dingy looking fabric.,40800,2
40800,Thought it was going to be some type of cotton but instead was polyester.,40800,2
40800,"Will be giving it away to
a clothing donation group.",40800,2
40801,"The dress is beautiful but the sequins were awful and sharp, sliced up my inner arm to the point of actually making little bleeding tears.",40801,2
40801,I had to return it.,40801,2
40802,Shirt is nowhere true to size,40802,2
40803,"I love the design of this ring, unfortunately the bad definitely outweighs good.",40803,2
40803,The ring was uncomfortable to wear.,40803,2
40803,Also the screws and outside edge are sharp I've cut myself with it several times also this ring should only be worn by a guy with baseball mits size hands otherwise it looks silly since it is so bulky.,40803,2
40803,Also the headline says 10mm and item discription say 9mm it confusing.,40803,2
40803,I will be returning.,40803,2
40803,I was really looking forward to getting it just disappointed.,40803,2
40804,"Material was o.k., but fit was horrible.",40804,2
40805,I purchased two of these shirts for my daughters.,40805,2
40805,I used the size chart and bought accordingly.,40805,2
40805,These shirts are very wide.,40805,2
40805,My daughters both do not like them because of how wide the shirts are.,40805,2
40805,Disappointed and too spendy to return.,40805,2
40806,Looks Cheap=(,40806,2
40807,Love the bracelet.,40807,2
40807,Magnets fell out already,40807,2
40808,Cute dress but it did not come with a belt as stated.,40808,2
40809,Much smaller than expected.,40809,2
40810,Breaks easily had purchased both and they both broke,40810,2
40811,I liked the style of the vest.,40811,2
40811,It looked like what was shown in the picture.,40811,2
40811,The followedreviews people posted about the vest fitting too small.,40811,2
40811,"Many recommended ordering a size larger than your true size however, I am a small and ordered a medium and I was swimming in it.",40811,2
40811,Had to return it.,40811,2
40811,I requested an exchange but the co.pany issied e a refund.,40811,2
40811,Too much effort when I to this order.,40811,2
40811,Not worth it and I have no vest.,40811,2
40812,"It would have fit, but the lining was much shorter so I couldn't use this as a bathing suit cover up.",40812,2
40812,Color was very pretty.,40812,2
40813,Returned it.,40813,2
40813,I intended it for a church function it was very fitting and absolutely not appropriate for the venue I purchased it for so returning.,40813,2
40814,Bad quality,40814,2
40815,I gave it as a gift and a little after a month it changed colors that was some BS,40815,2

40816,It run smaller,40816,2
40817,Gave it to my great niece - it was way too small!,40817,2
40818,Don't expect to get the skirt pictured in the first 5 images.,40818,2
40818,I got one more similar to the last two images.,40818,2
40818,"It's more pink and more of a faux silk material than chiffon, which made the pleating a less attractive.",40818,2
40818,The zipper is pretty cheap and a little difficult.,40818,2
40818,"It's still a nice skirt and fits as expected, but there is no stretch at all.",40818,2
40819,This necklace really feels like a cheap toy necklace.,40819,2

40820,"Super cute, but way too small.",40820,2

40821,The elastic across the top is very tight.,40821,2
40822,"It does not look like the picture the ""lace"" is like gold instead of white, and it is spandex material.",40822,2
40822,I got it as a xmas gift for someone and was going to return it.,40822,2
40823,Fit is awkward but I guess what you get for price,40823,2
40824,"I'm kind of disappointed in the sewing of this product,  for the price it was definitely worth it but I have to roll up the sleeves to make it look good",40824,2
40825,Top zipper broke on the third use.,40825,2
40826,Was really smelly when I first got it.,40826,2
40826,The smell as went away for the most part but I just don't like the purse.,40826,2
40826,I'm very fussy and it just didn't live up to my expectation.,40826,2
40826,Will probably pass onto a friend that might like it.,40826,2
40827,Disappointed.,40827,2
40827,I am busty and it pulls across my bust.,40827,2
40827,I would have returned it if I didn't have to pay for shipping back to China.,40827,2

40831,Not good,40831,2

40835,"Idk how many stars to give ( i had no choice but to choose ), the color and the material were very nice the cut however was off.",40835,2
40835,I had to return it,40835,2
40836,it was alright.,40836,2
40836,the cat is not in the right place like the picture and the fold of the hat doesn't cover the middle fingers,40836,2
40837,Careful with this one.,40837,2
40837,"It looks like a sweater, but it is made of very light t-shirt material and the fringes are simply knotted pieces of where the t-shirt was cut into strips.",40837,2
40837,"It is cute, but it is not true cardigan by US terms and it purely worn for style not warmth.",40837,2
40837,I bought an XL which realistically is a small.,40837,2
40838,"Doesn't fit right, material is so light.",40838,2
40839,Too small and fabric quality not to my liking.,40839,2

40840,Came with a couple stains on it.,40840,2
40840,I hope they come off in the wash,40840,2
40841,The size chart said 9 fits 9 months.,40841,2
40841,They forgot to mention that they don't stock the size 9 month and the 9 they have is for toddlers.,40841,2
40841,Sent back,40841,2
40842,"I've now purchased two packs of these (not sure why I bought the second), with the same poor results.",40842,2
40842,"Initially, they are ok because the rubber loop stays tight on the frame.",40842,2
40842,"But after only a short period, the loop loosens and moves up and down the ear frame.",40842,2
40842,It gets to the point that you have to constantly tighten them.,40842,2
40843,The fabric was very cheap.,40843,2
40844,This looks exactly  like the picture the problem  is that i ordered  xl and it  looks like a small sowa not fit,40844,2
40845,NOT a dress.,40845,2
40845,more like a regular shirt.,40845,2
40845,terrible fit.,40845,2
40846,Doesn't fit like a womens hat should.,40846,2
40846,A little large and not the best fit for a womans head.,40846,2
40846,Quality is great and the look is perfect.,40846,2
40846,"I will wear this because I love the style, just wish it fit like my other womens ball caps",40846,2
40847,Fabric is terrible!,40847,2
40847,Underlining is way too short and it's pretty much see through.,40847,2
40847,I am normally med/LG jrs or 6 womens- I ordered this in large and while it fits ok it looks terrible.,40847,2
40848,"Quality seems cheap, love the concept not thrilled with it.",40848,2
40849,Not as pictured,40849,2
40850,To small and it looks nothing like the picture.,40850,2
40850,Its has this ugly black lace at the bottom,40850,2
40851,"It really was a gorgeous piece of jewelry to wear to my daughter's wedding, however, I wore it for about two hours, hugged someone, and it fell off my neck and when it hit the floor, a stone came out.",40851,2
40851,"I'm very disappointed in the product, overall, and would not recommend buying it unless you ensure all the links are tightened, which is a lot of work for the price you pay.",40851,2
40852,Cheap material,40852,2
40853,very lumpy looking under shirts.. not that cute,40853,2
40854,Spins on your neck,40854,2
40855,"Cheap fabric, see through, thread is unraveling and I haven't even worn it.",40855,2
40856,Beautiful rings but after an 1hr of trying to get the ball I gave up!,40856,2
40856,Waste of money!,40856,2
40857,Ended up giving this men's extra large to an eleven year old boy.,40857,2
40857,The sizing is completely wrong,40857,2
40858,"It holds a lot, but I wish my keys and phone would fit at the same time.",40858,2
40858,Not a huge deal since that's my only complaint.,40858,2
40858,"The material is sturdy, and I can carry my phone, a portable charger, lipstick, all my credit cards, and a charging cable without the wristlet looking bulky.",40858,2
40858,"(I also have a Galaxy Note 4, so it takes up a lot of room.)",40858,2
40858,"Would definitely recommend, and I can see myself buying one in a different color eventually.",40858,2
40858,"Update 8/2016:  Well I've only had this for four months, and the strap has already broken off so it's useless as a wristlet now.",40858,2
40858,"If you plan on using this as an everyday thing, I would not recommend it as it fell apart way too soon for my liking.",40858,2
40859,the color are way diferent than that picture!,40859,2
40859,"the brown was to dark, the nose was pink not red like the picture... etc.",40859,2
40860,Cute top... but the XL I ordered would fit a youth XL.,40860,2
40861,Very very thin cheap quality cloth.,40861,2
40861,The legs fit fine but the hip and part where the legs connect is very small .,40861,2
40861,They will work for one day but I will not be using them again.,40861,2
40862,"They run a bit small, but fit ok once you break them in.",40862,2
40862,After 2 months the bottom of the shoe broke away.,40862,2
40862,"i won't say they weren't used, but they weren't abused.",40862,2
40862,This just shouldn't happen this early.,40862,2
40862,I'm very disappointed.,40862,2
40862,I wouldn't recommend.,40862,2
40862,My daughter is going back to Adidas.,40862,2
40863,Quite disappointed with this purchase.,40863,2
40863,"The button slits on both sides did not exist, so we had to cut them out and the metal fasteners for the straps did not come attached.",40863,2
40863,It took quite a while to put them on and I still don't think they are on properly.,40863,2
40863,"The over all fit was a little big, which is fine.",40863,2
40864,Pretty but does not fit right,40864,2
40865,The color is nice but it is way way way too small.,40865,2
40865,I bought them for my daugther who is very thin and barely fits into a size 1.,40865,2
40865,These couldn't go past her thighs.,40865,2
40866,One of the hooks arrived in the package already falling off and loose.,40866,2
40866,"This did not fit me at all as I expected and unfortunately I will be returning it, go a size smaller than you think you need for any real benefits.",40866,2
40866,Plus it looked bulky underneath my clothing!,40866,2
40867,Nice shirt.,40867,2
40867,Sized incorrectly tho,40867,2
40868,Sizing is way off.,40868,2
40868,I ordered both a large and extra-large.,40868,2
40868,The large was WAY too small.,40868,2
40868,The extra-large was more like a size 2x.,40868,2
40868,I washed the shirt in hot water and put it in the dryer certain it would shrink.,40868,2
40868,Did not really shrink that much.,40868,2
40868,Looked more like I was wearing a moo-moo.,40868,2
40868,"Shame, cause the shirt would have been adorable if it fit correctly.",40868,2
40869,"The material is not soft, its hard, I did not like the texture, for me it is not as it looks in the picture.",40869,2
40870,way way too small.,40870,2
40871,Material is like a 1999 pair of hanes.,40871,2
40871,"Aside from the design, I did not care for this item.",40871,2
40871,Fit smaller than expected and shrunk after first wash.,40871,2
40872,The quality isn't too good.,40872,2
40872,It smells like machine oil when received.,40872,2
40872,Too bad it's too small for me.,40872,2
40873,After reading the reviews decided to go for a bigger size and it was way too big.,40873,2
40874,IDK if its just me but it rides up my thighs.,40874,2
40875,Marks too easily.,40875,2
40875,Never looks nice.,40875,2
40876,Meh kinda cheap,40876,2
40877,MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN PICTURED.,40877,2
40877,VERY DISAPPOINTED.,40877,2
40878,Thin material.,40878,2
40878,"Takes 2 or more weeks to come, which is expected from Asia.",40878,2
40878,"Needs to be worn with a cami, or tank, unless you're very comfortable with your body being viewed.",40878,2
40878,"Very tight, for an xl, not at all stretchy.",40878,2
40878,"Came damp, odd.",40878,2
40878,"Color of the pink is more salmon, depending on lighting, outdoors it's salmon, indoors it's a lot like in the photo.",40878,2
40878,Neckline isn't very flattering.,40878,2
40878,"Not bad, but wouldn't buy again.",40878,2
40879,"Caution this is definitely Asian sizing, very small.",40879,2
40879,"Cute style and colors, the idea of this romper is cute, but way too sheer and runs very small.",40879,2
40879,"Very very sheer, I suppose it could be worn as a bathing suit cover up, otherwise you would have to wear something underneath which kind of defeats the purpose of a hot weather clothing item.",40879,2
40879,"I ordered the XL and I am 5'5"" with a relatively short torso, I'm not a large framed person and this was too small.",40879,2
40879,The space between the waist tie and the bottom of the shorts is much shorter than shown in the picture.,40879,2
40879,It was basically just way to small like it was made for a child sized torso length.,40879,2
40879,"Maybe if you are 5 feet tall or shorter, this will work for you.",40879,2
40879,Disappointed so this is going back.,40879,2
40879,You get what you pay for.,40879,2
40880,I received this with no lace...,40880,2
40880,?,40880,2
40880,??,40880,2
40880,I'm not sure how I'm supposed to wear this.,40880,2
40881,it fit great and looked flattering.,40881,2
40881,BUT the material is a cheap polyester and you can definitely tell the first time you set eyes on it.,40881,2
40881,it's more noticeable on the top.,40881,2
40881,from afar and from the seller pictures it looks like it would be one of those expensive designer versions but you can quickly tell its just a knockoff.,40881,2
40881,can't blame them especially for the price.,40881,2
40881,i love the lace and i wish it went all the way around to complete the look.,40881,2
40881,i didn't realize that i wouldn't like it just being on the front.,40881,2
40881,"the white on top is sheer so you can definitely see a bra through it, you would probably need a slip or camisole to wear underneath it.",40881,2
40882,Not what I expected.,40882,2
40883,This ear decorations look very cool.,40883,2
40883,"They are super flimsy and don't last, but for a one to five time use, it's ok.",40883,2
40884,"Knockoffs, skimpy at top",40884,2
40885,These are huge.,40885,2
40885,I bought for my 7 year old as they said child 6-7 and they don't even fit my 12 year old niece they are so big.,40885,2
40886,Material looks a little cheap in person.,40886,2
40886,Fit was odd- tight in chest and belly but loose in sleeves.,40886,2
40886,"I have been a small in maternity tops throughout most of my pregnancy, but now (in month 7) I've needed to get some size medium tops.",40886,2
40886,This one fit too small in the medium.,40886,2
40886,"Might have fit my belly earlier in pregnancy, but I still think it would have been too tight in the chest.",40886,2
40886,I would recommend sizing up.,40886,2
40887,ugly,40887,2
40888,"They run extremely small, I usually wear small or medium depending on the brand, I ordered large and it still didn't fit, the material isn't stretch either, not happy, didn't even return it it wasn't worth it, I'm saving it for my daughter.",40888,2
40889,Not sure why this did not work since I've used Assets before successfully.,40889,2
40889,But it was too small and difficult to get on.,40889,2
40889,It was also not the same fabric as the shapers I've used in the past.,40889,2
40889,Not sure if it would be as comfortable or durable even if they did fit.,40889,2
40890,Two stars for how cute it looks.,40890,2
40890,The material is stiff and bulky looking.,40890,2
40890,"It is transparent, I wouldn't wear it without a tank top underneath.",40890,2
40891,Works if you're six feet tall.,40891,2
40891,"Anything less, forget i!!",40891,2
40891,!,40891,2
40892,Too big,40892,2
40893,I loved the necklace.,40893,2
40893,It's just as pictured and beautiful upon receipt.,40893,2
40893,"However, I had only worn it once and then stored it in my jewelry box until I was ready to wear it again about a month or so later.",40893,2
40893,It is now completely tarnished just from sitting so much so that the metal on charm no longer matches the chain.,40893,2
40893,Really disappointed with the quality on such a beautiful necklace.,40893,2
40894,The style is great but it's very thin and it didn't wash well the very first time we washed it.,40894,2
40894,"It has little red speckles all over it, but they couldn't have come from us or our house.",40894,2
40895,material is see through.,40895,2
40896,No enough booby support,40896,2
40897,"Cute top, but I ordered 5X, knowing they run really small.",40897,2
40897,I am a size L-XL and 5X is too tight.,40897,2
40897,Not worth the time and effort to return.,40897,2
40897,I'll use the fabric for something else.,40897,2
40898,"Very pretty, but the fit runs small",40898,2
40899,"Order your usual size, or one size smaller.",40899,2
40899,"It's a thin coverup/dress, and the design isn't high quality, but it will last a summer or even two with care.",40899,2
40900,The glasses looked like the where metal in the photo but when I received them it was plastic instead,40900,2
40901,2 broke within a month,40901,2
40902,This tank top made such a goofy pucker in the back between the straps.,40902,2
40902,"It seemed REALLY large for a Medium as well, I wouldn't recommend this and REALLY regret removing the tags, I should have tried it on first so I could have returned it.",40902,2
40902,I'm very dissatisfied with this tank.,40902,2
40903,These are NOT the Top Gun glasses.,40903,2
40903,While they are mirrored they are way smaller than the other 10 pairs of glasses I've had in the past.,40903,2
40904,It doesn't look as nice as it does in the picture.,40904,2
40904,The plaid accents are more of a royal blue than the dark blue depicted in the photo.,40904,2
40904,"Also, the sizing of the shirt is very small; you may have to go up two sizes in order to fit this shirt.",40904,2
40905,"I am no stranger to ordering from Asian companies, so I checked the measurements and bought up a size--medium when I wear a US small.",40905,2
40905,Even then the top was too tight so I suggest ordering up two sizes.,40905,2
40905,"It was pretty cute, but the sleeves didn't match the picture; the picture shows 3/4 sleeves, but even though it was too small the sleeves went past my wrists, which made it way more formal, which is why I didn't reorder a size up.",40905,2
40906,Looked much cheaper in person.,40906,2
40906,"Also, the shade of nude is not ethnically versatile.",40906,2
40906,I had to give it away.,40906,2
40907,"Cheaply made, poorly sewn, cool design",40907,2
40908,The size was right but the shirt must be made smaller,40908,2
40909,I'm sad to find that unlike so many horns I have bought in the past?,40909,2
40909,"This set is not a lightweight plastic, instead?They are a sort of foam.",40909,2
40909,"[EVA it seems to be called tho, I could not easily find out what that was online.]",40909,2
40909,They have creases and bends that are now permanent to them - even while they were in their package.,40909,2
40909,Sad day.,40909,2
40909,"Yes they are light but, they are also easily damaged.",40909,2
40910,Waste of money.,40910,2
40910,It was not easy to use or maneuver.,40910,2
40911,"The boots fit on my foot fine, but the part around the my calf was too wide even when I tighten the boots.",40911,2
40911,If you're a big woman with thick calfs then these boots will be suitable.,40911,2
40911,The service was quick to send & came in new condition but the boots weren't the right ones for me.,40911,2
40912,THE BUTTONS ARE  VERY POOR QUALITY.,40912,2
40912,"IT IS A BIT SMALLER IN SIZE,",40912,2
40913,".this is a cute dress made out of rayon I thought it was black but it's a dark navy but the big problem is it is way too small I ordered a 2X and I think it
 this must be a size 10 couldn't even get it over my shoulders",40913,2
40914,I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT ARRIVED FLAT THEREFORE IT IS WRINKLED.,40914,2
40915,"Ordered 2x, more like a size large.",40915,2
40916,fits poorly arms too small while the body was very loose.,40916,2
40917,No.,40917,2
40917,Don't do it.,40917,2
40917,Looks NOTHING like the picture.,40917,2
40917,It's cut higher waisted so first off it looks like a pregnancy dress no matter how small you are...,40917,2
40917,I have nothing to hide and it seriously makes me look pregnant bc it poofs out below the waist belt.,40917,2
40917,"The ""lace"" sleeves look like fish net with big ugly flowers.",40917,2
40917,"The color is NOT navy, it's like clown ugly blue like a boys toybox color.",40917,2
40917,The pictures make it look darker than it is but the close up is closer to the color.,40917,2
40917,I rated it 2 star instead of 1 bc if they took a picture of THIS dress someone somewhere out there might like it...,40917,2
40917,But it's not the dress in the stock photo.,40917,2
40918,Loved the style but the size is way off.,40918,2
40918,I ordered a large and to me this was a small..or should I say extra small..not happy..,40918,2
40919,These are a very BIG 6G.,40919,2
40919,"They don't fit my holes, while trying to help one in my ear started to bleed.",40919,2
40919,:( One of the purple plugs came broken and the rose quartz is more of a white quartz.,40919,2
40919,Not very happy.,40919,2
40919,:(,40919,2
40920,So cute in the picture - but too small and the color was quite a bit more orange that I had anticipated.,40920,2
40921,Way too small on top.,40921,2
40921,Had to send it back.,40921,2
40922,"Cute pattern, but I ordered a size up and it still did not fit.",40922,2
40923,ordered a large because they said that was my size...well they werent.,40923,2
40923,go a size or two bigger.,40923,2
40923,at least my bf can wear them.,40923,2
40924,Nothing like the fit in the picture.,40924,2
40924,I went up a size and it is still much shorter and tighter than in the picture.,40924,2
40924,"I am 5'1"" tall, so for this shirt to hit middle of my rear sizing up to a medium (I am usually a small, size 2-4), I was very disappointed.",40924,2
40924,"The shirt is also not the soft, loose, flowy material that it appears in the picture.",40924,2
40924,I'm glad I only spent about $8 on this shirt.,40924,2
40925,My glasses have already broken.,40925,2
40925,I believe it may have just been the screw that fell out of the side.,40925,2
40925,However in my frustration I've just left them in my car console for now.,40925,2
40925,They were great for a few weeks.,40925,2
40925,"Love the style, the color, the fit.",40925,2
40926,"The style and the fit are great, but the fabric is WAY too thin; you can see through it when you bend over and it's stretched out a bit.",40926,2
40926,"I'll wear them around the house, but not in public.",40926,2
40926,Bummer.,40926,2
40927,Not as pictured.,40927,2
40927,Used cheaper components for leaves.,40927,2
40927,Par of leaf section arrived bent.,40927,2
40928,"This is a beautiful product I bought for my wife, but the size runs WAY small!",40928,2
40929,"Fit alright, but the quality was nothing special so I returned it.",40929,2
40930,I absolutely love this backpack.,40930,2
40930,"It's so pretty, and big enough for what I want, but yesterday when I revieced it I removed it from the package to find a it has a tear in the stitching in the bottom.",40930,2
40930,"I have never used this backpack, and I don't know if I can use it now that it hias this hole because I don't trust that it will hold up.",40930,2
40931,"bad quality, the sequence falling off as soon as you take it out of the bag",40931,2
40932,The mask was nice but it was torn a little bit from the side,40932,2
40933,This has two colors in it and the one color looks fake,40933,2
40934,Quality not as expected,40934,2
40935,They must run very small.,40935,2
40936,Made for a short person.,40936,2
40936,I found them a different home.,40936,2
40937,"It is cute enough, but did not fit even though I measure a 28 girth and the description states up to 31.",40937,2
40937,"I can close the clasp, but then the top and bottom fold outward, making me feel really fat.",40937,2
40937,Was really bummed as I bought this and paid expedited shipping so I could wear to a Christmas party.,40937,2
40937,:(,40937,2
40938,"only giving it 2 stars for actual quality and the overall fit of the top, which fit great!!",40938,2
40938,"the bottom, however, looked nothing like i thought it would.",40938,2
40938,it was WAY too small and revealing.,40938,2
40938,"if the bottom fit/looked the way it was supposed to, i definitely would've kept the whole set.",40938,2
40939,Not what I was hoping for.,40939,2
40939,A little too small on the top and the bottoms felt a little loose.,40939,2
40940,"I have a road shoe already that's much better, material looks cheep,it fallapart,pedals r way to small",40940,2
40941,They are cute and great.,40941,2
40941,"Easy to wear but after a few days of wearing them, the strap broke off at the toes spot so we couldn't even fix it.",40941,2
40941,Only was able to enjoy them for a few days:(,40941,2
40942,The front broke after 6 days of wear,40942,2
40943,Very nice and warm but very small.,40943,2
40943,I can barley zip .,40943,2
40943,I wear a medium had to get an xxl.,40943,2
40943,I rcvd n returned this coat 3x plus.,40943,2
40943,Wish I had one size bigger,40943,2
40944,the body fit but the  arm holes were not proportionate to the size of the outfit.,40944,2
40945,I purchased several of these shirts.,40945,2
40945,Colors are inconsistent.,40945,2
40945,Some materials were inferior.,40945,2
40945,"Fabric appears like a cotton blend in photo, but is thin and very stretchy.",40945,2
40945,"What initially looked to be a fashionable ""slouch tunic"" with belting possibilities, fell far short of my creative visions.",40945,2
40945,Returned.,40945,2
40946,Not cut like the picture at all,40946,2
40947,This material is extremely thin.,40947,2
40947,"I was expecting to use it as a sexy bathing suit, but its more like sheer nightgown material vs. swimwear",40947,2
40948,i did not like to fabric...not size fitting,40948,2
40949,"After reading the reviews I ordered down a size, a medium.",40949,2
40949,I wish I hadn't as the arms feel tight as it does across the back under  the arms.,40949,2
40949,"All else fits okay, so worried if I went up a size the length would be off as well as the neck.",40949,2
40949,I have not yet decided if I will keep it or not.,40949,2
40949,"I do like the fabric and weight for this season, so sad it is tight in the sleeves.",40949,2
40949,It is okay with a shirt but uncomfortable with sweater or suit jacket under it.,40949,2
40950,Custom measurements sent but dress is way too big in chest area.,40950,2
40950,Three people could fit in top of dress.,40950,2
40950,Super disappointed.,40950,2
40951,Pretty but small,40951,2
40952,"Very delicate, material is not pure.",40952,2
40952,"My skin reacted to it, since I am allergic to nickel.",40952,2
40953,These are very cute but the picture is deceiving.,40953,2
40953,They are much smaller than they look.,40953,2
40953,The top barely went past my second piercing and the stones are small as well.,40953,2
40953,I also felt the backs were very hard to stay in place.,40953,2
40953,The earring kept falling.,40953,2
40953,I should have looked at the reviews first to see the photos others posted.,40953,2
40953,It is my fault.,40953,2
40953,I ended up returning them.,40953,2
40954,It didn't fit properly.,40954,2
40954,It was no easy to adjust.,40954,2
40955,It won't last my grand daughter more then a week I went off the size she was in and went up on it,40955,2
40956,Nice material quality.,40956,2
40956,But not true to size.,40956,2
40957,Way too small.,40957,2
40957,Slightly larger than my toddler.,40957,2
40957,Smaller than my size 4 lace top similar to this one.,40957,2
40957,It does smell awful.,40957,2
40957,I'm sure the smell would disappear after a few washes.,40957,2
40957,For sensitive skin it does not seem to bother me.,40957,2
40957,"But, again, way too small.",40957,2
40957,Not at all like the picture.,40957,2
40958,When I received it there was a tear in the side but I was refunded for it.,40958,2
40958,It is on the thinner side so I wouldn't recommend it for winter,40958,2
40959,Paid practically double for two day shipping for this to come the day before Halloween.,40959,2
40959,"And it came yesterday, November 2nd.",40959,2
40959,The quality is mediocre and the eye holes are only the tiny nostril slits.,40959,2
40959,"Overall this purchace made my young brother cry and ruined his Halloween, but hes happy to have it now for a new costume later.",40959,2
40959,So two stars.,40959,2
40960,Itchy and uncomfortable.,40960,2
40960,It's not the best quality and my boob keeps coming out of it.,40960,2
40961,too big and too long.,40961,2
40962,"The leather end pieces are shaped  flat which will not allow them to be fastened to the trouser buttons without creating an uncomfortable bunching
at each button position.",40962,2
40962,The item I received also showed signs of dry cracking at the rear attach point.,40962,2
40962,For these reasons I returned the product at my expense.,40962,2
40962,Refund came quickly but I was unfairly required to pay return shipping.,40962,2
40963,Product arrived worn looking.,40963,2
40964,Nope..,40964,2
40964,I bought many pairs of these because I thought I'd stumbled upon a great product.,40964,2
40964,I was wrong.,40964,2
40964,These sock will shed more than 30% of their mass when you wash them.,40964,2
40964,"I washed 12 pairs, inside out, and it almost destroyed my dryer in the process.",40964,2
40964,"I fact, it took 4 times of washing and drying cycles before these socks stopped shedding.",40964,2
40964,Don't wash anything else with these socks unless you want black lint all over your clothes.,40964,2
40964,I gave a 3-pack to a friend as a gift (before I had washed mine and discovered the shedding) and he thought I was playing a prank on him.,40964,2
40964,There are much better travel socks out there that won't cause such a headache.,40964,2
40965,Thought it was a one/whole piece but it's a two piece.,40965,2
40965,Bottom is NOT what you expect!,40965,2
40965,It looks like silky underwear; not a bathing suit bottom.,40965,2
40965,"The top part is silky, no support, and it wraps around you, which you have to figure out on your own.",40965,2
40966,I wish I had read all reviews before buying this.,40966,2
40966,It looks nothing like the picture.,40966,2
40966,It looks really cheap.,40966,2
40967,The outfit fit very well but the back button popped while i was on the dance floor and ruined my whole night making by bday weekend short lived,40967,2
40968,Color was waay off and I couldn't even fix with two batches of rit dye,40968,2
40969,The fit of this top was very cute but it was very see through.,40969,2
40970,Usually wear a size 10 do I ordered thus.,40970,2
40970,Would've ordered maybe a size up if it was available just to make sure but even if I did it still wouldn't fit.,40970,2
40970,This shoe is way too small.,40970,2
40970,My mom wears 8 1/2 and the length of the size 10 fits her well but she can't wear it because the strap was too loose around her ankle and it can't be adjusted.,40970,2
40970,The shoe is beautiful though,40970,2
40971,The inside of the globe was full of dirt and the glue that attached the globe to the necklace has glue running down the sides.,40971,2
40971,It looked like it had so much potential but definitely a rush job.,40971,2
40972,The material is very PJ like.,40972,2
40972,Maybe I am too old for it but very nice on me.,40972,2
40972,"If you are hipster, it might work.",40972,2
40972,I didn't like the material anyway but again maybe  am getting to ld for looking hip,40972,2
40973,I'll give it the two stars for the cute pattern and the fact that it's isn't as see through as I expected it to be when I took it out of the package.,40973,2
40973,"Otherwise, if you're over 5'8"" or pregnant you should skip it.",40973,2
40973,"It's advertised as a ""maternity"" dress and at 5 1/2 months pregnant I'll be lucky to get a few more weeks out of it.",40973,2
40973,This is my first pregnancy and I'm not even showing that much.,40973,2
40973,The dress doesn't have any extra fabric around the middle for a growing bump.,40973,2
40973,"I'm 5'10"" and its hovering above my ankles.",40973,2
40973,I'll keep it as a post-baby outfit but not worth spending any of my maternity clothes budget on.,40973,2
40974,When I took it out of the package the dress was completely different then the picture.,40974,2
40974,"It was stiff, and the measurements were all off.",40974,2
40974,"Being a petite (5'2) lady, the dress was extremely long in the torso.",40974,2
40974,It wasn't flattering at all.,40974,2
40975,I brought this a few months ago to go with a outfit but it was way too big.,40975,2
40975,Now almost nine months later it's still too big.,40975,2
40975,Guess he will probably be able to fix it when he turn 4.,40975,2
40975,He's only 21 months not.,40975,2
40976,Nowhere in the product description (that I saw) did it say this hat is meant for toddlers.,40976,2
40976,It is way too small for any size head above a 4 year old.,40976,2
40977,We're too small,40977,2
40978,Brick red color is actually two tones of bright orange.,40978,2
40979,narrow and clings,40979,2
40980,Not happy with the quality of the material.,40980,2
40980,More for show than for use in a swimming pool.,40980,2
40981,This top fits like a large boxy smock.,40981,2
40982,"Definitely not as as small as some other reviewers mentioned - this is NOT a slim fit shirt, more like a regular t shirt.",40982,2
40982,"I usually wear size Large when it comes to Boss, definitely should get a size smaller.",40982,2
40983,They r extremely fat,40983,2

40984,Could not wear it.,40984,2
40985,"This was too small and not great quality, very thin.",40985,2
40986,"Nice design but it looks cheap not like the picture,also thin you have to wear a vest underneath.",40986,2
40986,Tired of these images that look nothing like the clothing.,40986,2
40987,I needed these socks for a costume and honestly these were pretty chintzy lace trimmed socks.,40987,2
40987,"However, for the price and one time wear, it was fine.",40987,2
40987,Not sure when or where you would ever wear these and the lace fell apart after a wash.  Would I buy them again?,40987,2
40987,Most likely not.,40987,2
40988,"It was too small, doesn't not look like the picture and it would fall apart easily.",40988,2
40988,The sewing is a horrible job.,40988,2
40989,Like the fact that it's light but a bit on the small size should of gone a size up?,40989,2
40990,"I'd give one star, but it gets two for accurate fit and comfortable material.",40990,2
40990,"Before I ever wore, washed, or hung up my jacket, the hem lines on the inside of the arms towards the wrist were already coming apart.",40990,2
40990,The moment it was unpackaged.,40990,2
40990,"I decided to keep it, things are easy enough to sew together, and perhaps I received a lemon.",40990,2
40990,"Fast forward to one wear (after sewing the hem line in on both arms - wrist area - more securely), BOTH sleeves became detached in the middle of themselves.",40990,2
40990,Now the material is being used as car wipes that I cut out of the un-salvageable garment.,40990,2
40990,I wouldn't recommend at all.,40990,2
40990,"The material is soft, that part was nice, but the design is completely cheap.",40990,2
40990,"I've never had a garment come apart like that after being unwrapped from it's plastic packaging, then completely falling a part after one wear.",40990,2
40990,"I'm allergic to wool, so I highly prefer poly-blends as far as work jackets go, I've never had an issue like this with any of my blended jackets.",40990,2
40990,"The sizing chart was accurate in sizing, it fit just fine and again the material was nice, beware of the bad design though.",40990,2
40990,"If you're okay with constantly sewing your clothes back together, this is the product for you.",40990,2
40991,The shirt is gorgeous but I ordered extra large and it is more like a medium.,40991,2
40992,This hat is not true to size,40992,2
40993,"Poor fitting, did not like.",40993,2
40994,Runs way too small.,40994,2
40995,"It does run small as the earlier reviews contained, so I ordered a size bigger and it fits good.",40995,2
40995,the quality isn't all that great.,40995,2
40996,Cheaply built.,40996,2
40996,Probably wouldn't last long.,40996,2
40996,Went back to my old Wenger wallet.,40996,2
40997,These shoes are poorly constructed and I don't expect them to last more that one summer.,40997,2
40997,"Would not recommend, and will not order another Nike downshifter series again",40997,2
40998,"I am 5'2"" and about 120 pounds and these fit awkward.",40998,2

40998,"I bought them for work, found myself pulling them up a lot.",40998,2
40998,I don't like them.,40998,2
40999,Cheap,40999,2

41002,Definitely didn't have full coverage.,41002,2
41002,Didn't flatten as much as I wanted it to.,41002,2
41002,Wouldn't recommend it to anyone w/over a C cup.,41002,2
41003,"The material is like a nylon stretchy material and the pattern just doesn't sit right on me (5'3"").",41003,2
41003,"I will not be wearing it that's for sure, but I don't think they have a free return policy so I might just give it away.",41003,2
41003,:/,41003,2
41004,"Not what I expected, nothing like the pic or description",41004,2
41005,The size was way too big.,41005,2
41006,Extremely tight for a xxxl but hoping to lose enough weight to be able to wear it.,41006,2
41006,"If not, will give to someone it will fit as returns as I have found on amizon are not always pre-paid buyer be ware of fine print",41006,2
41007,The sleeve holes are cut small didn't hang even.,41007,2
41007,If arms are on larger size won't go in right.,41007,2
41007,Had no paper work for return if did not fit or proof of purchase,41007,2
41008,The picture make it look bigger than what it is and then make the details in the charm look more defined but in person it's not,41008,2
41009,The sleeves are too short and it is too tight.,41009,2
41010,I.am very disappointed that this garment came without the required tags.,41010,2
41010,"It is a federal law that garments must have the fabric content, like cotton, polyester or silk for instance, and the country of origin, USA .or Taiwan etc.",41010,2
41010,The fabric is listed as chiffon but that is not a fabric content.,41010,2
41010,Chiffon is a style of weaving like twill or basket weave.,41010,2
41011,"Not a very great product, you get what you pay for - a cheap hat.",41011,2
41011,I don't plan to wear it or keep it.,41011,2
41012,"It was cute while I still super excited about a deathly hollows, until I really looked at it and noticed how low quality it was.",41012,2
41012,For the price  I guess it was ok.,41012,2
41013,Many stones and other pieces missing and also not in the bag!,41013,2
41014,Very very poor quality.,41014,2
41014,Stitching is bad.,41014,2
41014,I knew fabric was going to be cheap.,41014,2
41014,But if the bikini falls apart while wearing it.... then.... think again.,41014,2
41014,Well...,41014,2
41014,I will definitely be more careful shopping for chinese made products in the future.,41014,2
41015,Like that it doesnt have a wire and is easily moved out of the way.,41015,2
41015,disappointed though it does not unhook and bring the flap down to expose the breast,41015,2
41016,Material is super thin and already falling apart at the bottom,41016,2
41017,you cant see the words or the picture that well.,41017,2
41018,The print is gorgeous and the quality of the dress is fine.,41018,2
41018,"Downside about this dress is it fits way too small, bought a Large and it seems like it's rather a small !",41018,2
41018,way way too small !,41018,2
41019,I bought it for a friend.,41019,2
41019,It was so small her daughter could wear it.,41019,2
41020,"Every coat and shirt I own is a small, I ordered a size up due to other reviews.",41020,2
41020,Not only did it arrive a wrinkled mess but I can't even button the top button.,41020,2
41020,I'm incredibly short waisted and the ties hit around my back bra line.,41020,2
41021,Very disappointed.,41021,2
41021,The stone had fallen out during shipping and the clasp was stuck and would not open.,41021,2
41021,I almost had to remake it.,41021,2
41022,"Was SUPPOSED to be mid calf, and it barely covered my knees.",41022,2
41022,"I am only 5'4"", so I shouldn't have had that issue, had to return....",41022,2
41023,I thought these were unbreakable.,41023,2
41023,My dog destroyed one of them in about 2 minutes.,41023,2
41023,The price was ok.,41023,2
41024,"It looks like the picture, but it is very rough and definitely different from the one I got from bridal salon.",41024,2
41024,I washed it with cold water and fabric softener but it didn't soften it.,41024,2
41024,I am returning it.,41024,2
41025,I ordered xxl because normally I uses L .,41025,2
41025,To smal but good quality !,41025,2
41026,"I am 5'2"", 190 lbs, I'm short and stout :-P These are comfortable and the color is true, but they show all my rolls and are very see through.",41026,2
41026,"They also fall below my knees, but again, I'm short.",41026,2
41026,"These would probably be great for the taller, more toned ladies out there.",41026,2
41027,Fit snug but really long.,41027,2
41027,Very thin material and not flattering at all.,41027,2
41028,The print on this T-shirt was very substandard and looks much better in the ad picture,41028,2
41029,"It ran smaller then anticipated, and didn't have a lot of coverage!",41029,2
41030,My pink one fits great.,41030,2
41030,This one and my white one are defected.,41030,2
41030,The elastic is so tight i cant wear them.,41030,2
41031,I'm 5'6 and my weight ranges from 158-165 and I bought a size 10.,41031,2
41031,They fit ok around the waist but they are not flattering.,41031,2
41031,They sag and look like you are wearing a wet diaper.,41031,2
41031,I wore them once and will probably not wear them again.,41031,2
41031,Not worth the money.,41031,2
41032,Pants where too big.,41032,2
41033,Expected it to be fuller,41033,2
41034,i ordered this dress in white and when it came it was blue so i returned it and ordered the white again and again i was given the wrong color besides that the dress is nice,41034,2
41035,Somewhat large,41035,2
41036,Material is heavy and feels great but the cut of the neck and the seams going up the front make it look like a woman's shirt.,41036,2
41036,As a base layer it's fine but would look silly if not covered.,41036,2
41037,does not work,41037,2
41038,Love the design but started chipping off the day after I got it bad quality.,41038,2
41039,Zipper broke now bag is useless,41039,2
41040,The model in the picture is obviously tiny because her sleeves look flowy.,41040,2
41040,The top that actually arrived does not have the same side ruffle detail as what is pictured.,41040,2
41040,Its a smaller cheaper looking ruffle with two large covered buttons that sortof look like the center of a flower or a bow.,41040,2
41040,The sleeves are just... weird.,41040,2
41040,And it's short in the waist.,41040,2
41041,it must have been made in China because the size large was like a small  same goes for the xl  very disappointed that i can wear it and its a total waste of my money!!!,41041,2
41041,i bought 2 one for me and one for my granddaughter,41041,2
41042,I got the size that I typically wear and from looking at the picture I thought it would be a loose fit but it was really snug and much shorter than I expected.,41042,2
41043,"Way to heavy in the front, I was constantly yanking the back down.",41043,2
41044,I ordered a size bigger just in case and the 2x was very tight and very see-thru.,41044,2
41044,The item was returned.,41044,2
41045,"I was looking for a boxer/brief with a package pouch, I bought 1 SAXX to find out it does not hold, cradle, lift or separate like what i was looking for.",41045,2
41045,I am really not sure what SAXX does.,41045,2
41046,screw missing fell apart not unlike the election.,41046,2
41047,"too lose, and not sticking to skin",41047,2
41048,I usually wear size S (size 4) but purchase two sizes bigger as suggested by others but the dress was way too big.,41048,2
41048,I should have purchase my normal size.,41048,2
41048,The bottom half of the dress is shorter than shown in the photo.,41048,2
41048,The stitches came off after one wash.,41048,2
41048,This was not well made at all.,41048,2
41049,I like everything except the fact that it's see through.,41049,2
41049,the bottom part should have been lined but it isn't.,41049,2
41050,some what too small and the fabric feels a bit strange.,41050,2
41051,Colors were not as depicted in the photo and shipping took forever seeing how they came from China.,41051,2
41051,Also the way there made the hole looks more so like a 4g then 2g(size i ordered),41051,2
41052,This dress is completely see through so if you buy it make sure you have something to wear underneath it!,41052,2
41053,Wow boo on iHeartRaves for a making the shoulder straps humongous and the two loops for the forearms and wrists tiny.,41053,2
41053,Who has huge shoulders like a man with tiny ring forearms ?,41053,2
41054,Runs very small,41054,2
41055,Pretty disappointed.,41055,2
41055,It doesn't really look like the picture.,41055,2
41055,"All you can see is the shell, the starfish is stuck at the top and you can barely even tell what it is",41055,2
41056,California is spelled wrong!!!!,41056,2
41056,!,41056,2
41057,"It looks cool, especially if you're in shape, but I wouldn't recommend it for its functionality.. Firstly, it's not warm at all, a slight breeze whips right through it.",41057,2
41057,"The pockets are also tiny and located closer to the armpits than the waist, giving the wearer a T-Rex affect when they try to walk with their hands in their pockets.",41057,2
41057,The zippers on the pockets also grind up my hands that don't fit fully into the pocket.,41057,2
41057,The double zipper on the inside is pretty much useless.,41057,2
41057,"I've had it for about a month and have had multiple compliments on its looks, I just wish it was warmer and had man sized pockets.",41057,2
41058,Do not fit.,41058,2
41058,Not size expected.,41058,2
41058,XXL for child size.,41058,2
41058,Have to my family member.,41058,2
41058,She is 10 years old.,41058,2
41059,Really like the color and the fit.,41059,2
41059,The only thing we feel is wrong is the quality of the material which seems thin and the length of the sleeves are a little short.,41059,2
41060,when I got it the  necklace was leaking something like a goo  that got all over the necklace which  made it have a foul smell so I returned it.,41060,2
41061,too small.,41061,2
41061,smaller than expected and the zipper keeps getting stuck.,41061,2
41061,also if you place brushes on the lid slots don't expect them to stay in there!,41061,2
41062,"Really pretty, but it turned colors really quickly :-(",41062,2
41063,It wasn't even a week and the chain link broke.,41063,2
41064,I don't like it.,41064,2
41064,It's a lot larger and it's flat and hollow.,41064,2
41064,Not really what I was expecting,41064,2
41065,"the fabric is good and the brim is as shown, but the crown is really too high to be worn comfortably - at least by me.",41065,2
41066,Do not buy if your baby is over two months.,41066,2
41066,They are still easy to get off,41066,2
41067,"about a half inch of chain links were messed up so can not wear it
Pendant is lovely just the same",41067,2
41068,"This sweater is very short, sleeves not tight around around the arms and just not very well made..",41068,2
41069,"Much Much smaller than one would think , even for Chinese sizes.",41069,2
41069,"I am usually a size small, and could not even get the large over my head.",41069,2
41069,Seller would not return.,41069,2
41069,Waste of money.,41069,2
41070,SNAGS super easily!,41070,2
41070,Be careful!,41070,2
41071,Material is soft and comfortable....but too big.,41071,2
41072,The costume is ok at best.,41072,2
41072,"The top was fine although shorter than I hoped for (I'm 5'10 with even proportions), but the skirt is awful.",41072,2
41072,The sewing was done haphazardly and there were several places with the skirt bunched up in the seam and the fabric looked terrible.,41072,2
41072,The pleats at the center were completely off center too.,41072,2
41072,I took the skirt off and reattached it so it laid smoothly and was even.,41072,2
41072,The skirt had several places where the blue was coming off because the material is cheap.,41072,2
41072,If it got snagged on something or was pulled at all it would turn white and look awful.,41072,2
41072,Order down a size or two.,41072,2
41072,"If you're on the larger end of what each size will fit, order down 1 size.",41072,2
41072,"If you're on the smaller end of each size, go 2 sizes smaller.",41072,2
41072,I'd prefer straps on it even if they're clear or any way to keep the top up better.,41072,2
41072,Because it fits such a large range there is a TON of elastic on the back and if you're not pulling it tight it doesn't stay up and had an unflattering fit.,41072,2
41072,The boot covers are poorly made too.,41072,2
41072,I have big calves and they were too big on me.,41072,2
41072,They won't stay up and there's no real way for the cover to stay in place.,41072,2
41072,There's only an elastic that's supposed to go under your shoe but that doesn't work because It attaches with Velcro on the bottom of the shoe so you're stepping on it the whole time.,41072,2
41072,The only way to keep this in place would be to spray glue it to whatever shoes your wearing.,41072,2
41072,You're better off buying the actual boots which look awesome.,41072,2
41072,Too bad I saw them too late to get here in time.,41072,2
41072,I wouldn't buy this again unless I was desperate.,41072,2
41073,I used the size chart but way too small.,41073,2
41073,Out of the package it looked like it had been worn.,41073,2
41073,"Had no problems with return, seller gave me 1/2 my money back and told me to keep the dress.",41073,2
41073,I'll donate it prom season is coming up.,41073,2
41073,"I ordered the largest size, my bust is 36C, waist is 33, and hips 42.",41073,2
41073,"The bust squeezed my breast down, really unflattering.",41073,2
41074,Ugly,41074,2
41075,I returned it.,41075,2
41075,It was just awkward and there was a lot of falling out from the bottom.,41075,2
41075,"I am a 36DD, I saw that some bustier women had success, but none of them were me.",41075,2
41076,"I normally wear a US 12 or 14, but based on all the reviews, I ordered an XL, and it was HUGE.",41076,2
41076,"Quality seemed okay, but the high waisted bottoms came up to a couple of inches under my bust, so it looked like I was wearing some kind of weird maternity swimsuit.",41076,2
41076,"Maybe it's my body type, but this just didn't work for me at all.",41076,2
41077,I liked the kimono and it fit well.,41077,2
41077,Very flattering and the colors were nice.,41077,2
41077,Mine came with a missed/ripped seam in the front.,41077,2
41077,It created a hole that was not repairable by hand without creating awkward puckering.,41077,2
41077,"I requested a refund and was told I could ship it back, at my expense, for a full refund.",41077,2
41077,Mailing a package to China would cost me more than I paid for the shirt!,41077,2
41077,Or I could keep the unwearable garment for 20% refund.,41077,2
41077,"Very minimal amount of money so I'm not super bent out of shape about it, but I am annoyed.",41077,2
41078,Way too small!,41078,2
41079,Ordered one size up and it still was way too small.,41079,2
41080,It definitely wasn't the size it said,41080,2
41081,"If you're looking for a bag that smells bad and breaks within hours of its first use, then THIS is the bag for you!",41081,2
41081,"Yes, it's cute.",41081,2
41081,I used it for my big night on the town and it was the perfect addition to my dress.,41081,2
41081,"Unfortunately, by the end of the night, I tossed it out.",41081,2
41081,"Not only did it cause everything that I put in it to smell like weird chemicals (my wallet will never be the same), but the chain broke mid-strut while I was crossing an intersection.",41081,2
41081,I had to risk my neck to pick up this piece of crap from incoming traffic!,41081,2
41081,"I know the reason that you're looking at this bag is because you're looking for a cute, cheap purse to pair with a cute outfit for a special occasion.",41081,2
41081,"For your own good, pass this by.",41081,2
41081,It's not worth it.,41081,2
41082,Nice.,41082,2
41082,The top collar is too high.,41082,2
41082,Making it awkward.,41082,2
41083,Not silky as described by one of reviewers.,41083,2
41083,Its pure rayon and its not long at all.,41083,2
41083,Im returning it.,41083,2
41083,Too thin wnd flimsy.,41083,2
41083,Its literally a piece of fabric with sleeves.,41083,2
41083,Nothing to it.,41083,2
41083,Pattern is nice looking though.,41083,2
41084,"These are beautiful and appear to be great quality, but are too big for me.",41084,2
41084,Maybe if they came out with 2 sizes in this they'd work for more people.,41084,2
41084,"Sadly, I'll be returning them.",41084,2
41085,Not the best dress I have found online.,41085,2
41085,The breast pads are horrible.,41085,2
41085,Plan on cutting them out.,41085,2
41085,I ordered an XL and it was too big.,41085,2
41085,(I normally wear an XL or XXL)  The dress was also too long for me.,41085,2
41085,"I'm 5' 7"".",41085,2
41085,I do like the colors.,41085,2
41086,"I wasn't expecting much for the price but the bra came up rip on the bottom, by the seam.",41086,2
41086,The garter belt is missing one of the staps...,41086,2
41086,Therefore i am a little disappointed.,41086,2
41087,"Lovely print, but runs big.",41087,2
41087,"A small could easily be a medium, but no x-small option.,",41087,2
41088,Looks cute online but the quality wasn't the best.,41088,2
41088,Returned it.,41088,2
41089,I returned the product.,41089,2
41089,I am tall so it does not fit as shown in the picture.,41089,2
41089,"The minute I pulled it out, I could tell it was very short.",41089,2
41089,"Material felt nice and a little stretchy, but the way the sleeves looked once I tried it was not as flowy and nice as shown or expected.",41089,2
41089,Looked like wings.,41089,2
41089,I would say it might be fine for a petite person.,41089,2
41089,I ordered a Large (normally I wear a Medium) so the sizing is off.,41089,2
41090,"The top is very small for 24 month, yet i ordered it bigger than her age, wasn't expecting the first piece to be like it is , its only for cold place like state not for caribean .",41090,2
41090,I thing they should discribe the full quality of the profucts.,41090,2
41091,Okay looking,41091,2
41092,cheap material.. not worth your money.,41092,2
41093,The pictures are not the same product I received.,41093,2
41093,There is no lining inside to hold my package.,41093,2
41093,I am wear 32. order size M.  It was too small.,41093,2
41093,I just waste my money.,41093,2
41094,I understand that when I order a cheap bathing suit online I am rolling the dice.,41094,2
41094,I am 5'10 size 12 and I ordered an XL.,41094,2
41094,"The fit was ok, the bottom straps fit well, but about the half the straps were nearly ripped off the bathing suit when I tried it on.",41094,2
41094,I am a 36 c and while the top fits my the side of the top is loose.,41094,2
41094,As a result when I sat down with it on my boobs slipped out.,41094,2
41094,Luckily I found all of this out in the privacy of my apartment.,41094,2
41094,As I hate returning things with the fire of a thousand suns I patched the broken bottom straps and attached a bikini strap to the top to keep the girls in place.,41094,2
41094,All in all cute for the price but I didn't expect the labor required to make this work,41094,2
41095,Stretching fabric for the top runs small.,41095,2
41096,"Way too small for my nose, and therefore useless.",41096,2
41096,"The ball bearing is of mediocre quality (and is significantly whiter than the product images suggest), but the ring itself seems quite sturdy.",41096,2
41096,"There's no bend to the ring so, unfortunately it just doesn't fit.",41096,2
41096,Definitely a waste of my money.,41096,2
41097,One of the t-shirts has a big hole in it.,41097,2
41097,Otherwise the quality is good.,41097,2
41098,"I love the print but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to make the dress I received, look like the dress pictured.",41098,2
41098,I have extra straps.,41098,2
41099,the material is not what  I thought it would be and it was very small for a 3XL.,41099,2
41099,wish I could return it.,41099,2
41100,The concept of large gets lost in translation.,41100,2
41100,Americans are far larger than the measuring tools I think they have in China.,41100,2
41100,Anyway I contacted the seller and I returned the dressage few days ago.,41100,2
41100,It was far smaller than the other outfit I purchased.,41100,2
41100,The coloring and details were nice though.,41100,2
41101,a lot smaller than what display on line...,41101,2
41102,"This came to me very fast, for the price it is nice however the image is a bit shifted and the colors blend in, it is not as bright as the image shows....",41102,2
41103,"Great bag, yet it didn't have an interior pocket that fit my iPhone 6S Plus.",41103,2
41103,"Other than that, it is a great tote.",41103,2
41104,They were ment for my 16 year old son as nd they fit my 10 year old son....tooo tinny.,41104,2
41105,It was too small.,41105,2
41105,I was very dissapointed .,41105,2
41105,they should have a I/XL size as well.,41105,2
41106,TOP WAS CUT VERY SHORT.,41106,2
41106,IT LEFT A 2-3 INCH GAP BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BOTTOMS.,41106,2
41106,NOT THE BEST FIT FOR SKIING.,41106,2
41106,"THE MATERIAL WAS VERY COMFORTABLE, BUT THE TOP WAS JUST TOO SHORT.",41106,2
41107,"I am a 34 waist 6""tall 185 pounds I ordered the Xl and XXL guess what?",41107,2
41107,I couldn't pull the XL up past my knees and the xxl fit me like a pair of girls panties!,41107,2
41107,What a waste of time you would think by now the Chinese would figure out everyone in the east is twice their size.,41107,2
41107,Unless your Body is rock solid muscle and you get the XXXL Do Not Even Bother Buying!,41107,2
41108,this product was too small and not an actual adult large.,41108,2
41108,i can wear mediums in regular sizing but this one was too short in the length,41108,2
41109,"Super small, is not true to size.",41109,2
41110,I thought this was way to wide for a headband.,41110,2
41110,My daughter wears it though and loves it.,41110,2
41110,It covers her ears and keeps her warm...but whoa the static.,41110,2
41110,Lol,41110,2
41111,sleeves are slightly too tight,41111,2
41112,The sizing is way off.,41112,2
41112,It doesn't come close to the right size.,41112,2
41112,And you can see through the fabric.,41112,2
41113,"too small ,i'm 5'4 124 pounds and the size medium is too small.",41113,2
41114,"Ended up taking it apart, cutting some length off of the longer strap, and reassembling.",41114,2
41114,"Not really worth the price for the quality, in my opinion.",41114,2
41115,this bralette was way to large (i wear a 32B) frayed very quickly and looks very poorly made.,41115,2
41115,not worth it.,41115,2
41116,The long strap broke within a week,41116,2
41117,The print on the tee wasn't fully printed.,41117,2
41117,The tops of the letters weren't printed.,41117,2
41117,Poor appearance.,41117,2
41117,Tee shirt is comfortable.,41117,2
41118,Completely see thru material is cheap don't waste your money,41118,2
41119,It is not comfortable,41119,2
41120,Very pretty swimsuit but unfortunately it runs small,41120,2
41121,I loved the idea of an affordable hunting blazer but this one came out totally wrong.,41121,2
41121,In all fairness the wool fabric they used is ok.,41121,2
41121,It is similar to their wool shirts that I own.,41121,2
41121,The arm patches are very low quality.,41121,2
41121,They are made from a low quality synthetic material that has no weight to it.,41121,2
41121,The sizing is so off it is insane.,41121,2
41121,After all do blazers come in a XXL ?,41121,2
41121,Don't waste your time.,41121,2
41121,Great Idea that needs to be seriously re thought before it is produced.,41121,2
41121,"Shipping with the lower 48 States $19.95

RETURNED",41121,2
41122,The bottoms are the expected size but the top is extremely small.,41122,2
41122,I'm a 34d and when I pulled it out it was like a 34b so I would say it was 2 sizes smaller then expected -,41122,2
41123,"xxxl usually fits, this is way too small.",41123,2
41124,sending back i bought a green one and a purple one the same size that fit this does not,41124,2
41125,This is much smaller than others for the money .,41125,2
41126,I don't like the bottoms.,41126,2
41126,"They are too large and sit very high, like less than an inch below my belly button.",41126,2
41126,Looks weird on.,41126,2
41126,The top is ok though.,41126,2
41127,"Hard to hook on wrist, but pretty",41127,2
41128,"The bracelet arrived in excellent shape, but broke within two weeks.",41128,2
41128,The old adage is true....you get what you pay for.,41128,2
41129,The sweater is very heavy with the wiring and battery pack and the lights started slipping out of the holes right away.,41129,2
41129,Pretty shoddy construction of the lights.,41129,2
41130,this is so pretty.,41130,2
41130,love the cut...,41130,2
41130,BUT.....very revealing.,41130,2
41130,i am 5ft.,41130,2
41130,"6 "" and the size should of been fine but definitely petite!!",41130,2
41130,so i gave it to my skinny tiny 24 yr. old daughter and she looks gorgeous in it!!!,41130,2
41130,she wears it when she goes out with black pants and it is perfect.,41130,2
41130,so i highly recommend ONLY if you are a petite and YOUNG!!!,41130,2
41130,LOL,41130,2
41131,broke immediately.,41131,2
41132,"OMG, there is a small size right there.",41132,2
41132,I am 5' 4'' weight 140 pounds and bought XL.,41132,2
41132,Guess what it's tight.,41132,2
41133,Fell apart after a week,41133,2
41134,Dress was extremely small in the chest.,41134,2
41134,I ordered a 'Large' to account for chest sizing.,41134,2
41134,"I still could not zip the 'large', and I wear a size 8 in dress size.",41134,2
41134,Colorof the dress is more peach than pink.,41134,2
41134,I am rather tall and it dropped to the floor on me (which if wearing heels is okay).,41134,2
41134,"If you have breasts, this is not the dress for you.",41134,2
41135,"These are way, way too long.",41135,2
41135,"I could hem them, but I'd lose most of the print on the bottom.",41135,2
41135,"The material is rather cheap, too.",41135,2
41136,I should have read the reviews... the necklace is pretty but the arrow is tiny!,41136,2
41136,Not so much a statement piece.,41136,2
41137,Very nice quality but small.,41137,2
41137,"I bought up 2 sizes from what I normally wear, and the belt still didn't fit.",41137,2
41138,"Didn't fit me, gave it to my daughter.",41138,2
41139,I have many of these shirts and they generally all fit the same.,41139,2
41139,This one had large cuffs allowing the cuff to slide down on to my hands.,41139,2
41139,Had to take it to a local alteration shop and have them tighten the cuff.,41139,2
41139,This added to the cost of the shirt.,41139,2
41139,Hope this was an isolated incident.,41139,2
41140,Should have read the reviews....This top fits a size to big.,41140,2
41140,"Also, the fabric is terrible.",41140,2
41140,Like someone posted before kind of like a table clothe material.,41140,2
41140,Don't waste your money.,41140,2
41141,"Super cute, but they arrived with scratches all over the lens:( so disappointed.",41141,2
41142,This dress was so cute I fell in love with it.,41142,2
41142,But  when I got it it was way to small and I brought a extra large.,41142,2
41143,DID NOT LIKE THE DRESS,41143,2
41144,Missing neck strap...,41144,2
41145,Cheaply made and hollow.,41145,2
41145,Mine came with a sort of discoloration on it that makes it look scratched.,41145,2
41145,Complete disappointment.,41145,2
41146,I got a 4t for my 2yr old and they are so tight on him.,41146,2
41146,I would not recommend to anyone,41146,2
41147,Very disappointed...jacket arrived with a broken zipper so I will be returning this jacket for a full refund,41147,2
41148,Bought these for my 2 year old and they are difficult to keep on.,41148,2
41148,The shoes don't fit snuggly so they fall off easily.,41148,2
41149,"only one has the correct size, size 12 and ordered the measure are correct but in very different sizes, one looks for three months.",41149,2
41150,"It's a beautiful design and soft, flowy fabric.",41150,2
41150,"However, the material is sheer so be warned.",41150,2
41150,The shoulders are too tight.,41150,2
41150,"When I compare this to other shirts of similar style, the back seems to be too small on the top, so it lays awkwardly most of the time.",41150,2
41151,the knife handles are pink...,41151,2
41152,The fit and comfort are normal and good feel of any cotton shirt.,41152,2
41152,The reason it gets a 2/5 is because of the neck opening.,41152,2
41152,"I'm not used to, nor do I like large neck openings for my shirts.",41152,2
41152,It felt like it had been excessively stretched.,41152,2
41152,This is after one wash. You can see in the photos how much larger than a normal medium sized shirt it is.,41152,2
41152,It felt like my shirt was coming off of my shoulder the entire day.,41152,2
41152,"That being said, everyone enjoyed my shirt at the BN Org Day (except my CDR).",41152,2
41152,lol Wish the neck wasn't so large or I'd wear it more often.,41152,2
41153,Lovely colours but these fit small and do not wash and wear well,41153,2
41154,i ordered a large which is the size i normally wear.,41154,2
41154,Would fit a 12 year old better,41154,2
41155,"nice material but way too long for my liking, going to have to alter the length.",41155,2
41155,good price for a shirt though.....,41155,2
41155,I'm sure i do something with it,41155,2
41156,Smaller than expected.,41156,2
41156,"Had tear, contacted seller and received nothing not even an email.",41156,2
41156,Cute tho.,41156,2
41157,child's sizing,41157,2
41158,The size said XXL but it is more like a regular large.,41158,2
41158,Not happy with the purchase.,41158,2
41159,This is very pretty...as a shirt.,41159,2
41159,"For perspective, I'm 5' 2"" and the cover up hit above my mid thigh.",41159,2
41159,"I'd recommend as a shirt, not a cover up.",41159,2
41160,"very cheap looking ,the silver is actually peeling and tarnished",41160,2
41161,I just don't get these.,41161,2
41161,I want them to work but everything just doesn't fit.,41161,2
41161,Do you put in the frank and then the beans?,41161,2
41161,The tie seams useless as it only goes through those two holes.,41161,2
41161,I'm no long dong silver but damn.,41161,2
41161,Give a brotha some room.,41161,2
41162,Maybe I got a bad batch.,41162,2
41162,But the fabric looks more like cotton and is a little faded/cheap (it's brand-new).,41162,2
41162,"The jacket has the hand-sewn thread on the pockets & collar, which I never like.",41162,2
41162,The fifth pocket makes the jacket looks more like a boys jacket.,41162,2
41162,You would have to helm the pants.,41162,2
41162,I returned it.,41162,2
41163,Cute dress but tight on the arms.,41163,2
41163,Definition ideal for thin girls without curves.,41163,2
41164,Thin material and cheaply made.,41164,2
41164,You get what you pay for,41164,2
41165,"Cute shirt, but we received the wrong size.",41165,2
41165,Cant wear it and is shipped so far its not worth returning for the price.,41165,2
41166,Looks Wonkey,41166,2
41167,They are only good for around the house as the fabric is super thin.,41167,2
41167,One (I bought two) got caught on something small and ripped so easily.,41167,2
41167,Fabric is so thing that you cannot sew it to fix them and it frays.,41167,2
41167,I would not buy it again had I known.,41167,2
41168,Xl fit like a small.,41168,2
41169,This is extremely small.,41169,2
41169,"I am a XS, I got a medium and I still couldn't zip it up all the way.",41169,2
41169,Otherwise it was great.,41169,2
41169,Just wish it would have fit,41169,2
41170,Not what I was expecting.,41170,2
41170,Its a ribbed tank dress and it's too big.,41170,2
41170,Ordered a medium should have got a small.,41170,2
41170,The longer you wear it the more stretched out it gets and after a few hours you look frumpy and sloppy.,41170,2
41171,I love this but the top came sorta ripped when I got it.,41171,2
41171,I still own the skirt but I wish the top hadn't come all messed up.,41171,2
41172,The numbers around the outside of the dial rubbed off within a week.,41172,2
41172,"The face is so dark that it's hard to see the numbers there, as well.",41172,2
41172,"Not a great design, especially for kids who are learning to tell time.",41172,2
41173,Quality wasn't as expected but ok for casual wear...,41173,2
41174,Runs super small,41174,2
41175,This hat looks so cute on the model.,41175,2
41175,"Sadly, it didn't look so cute on me.",41175,2
41175,"The ear flaps stuck out some distance from my ears, and were very long, so would not have kept my ears warm.",41175,2
41175,"As another reviewer had mentioned, the elastic on the end of the ear flaps to go over the buttons on the side of the hat, when not using the ear flaps, are quite cumbersome.",41175,2
41175,It's too bad.,41175,2
41175,I liked the color and the fur fringe.,41175,2
41175,It really does look so cute on the model.,41175,2
41176,Was not happy with quality of item.,41176,2
41176,Seem cheap n light weight was questioning if ring was real.,41176,2
41176,I end up getting a better ring from Zales.com,41176,2
41177,the material had strings all over and the armpit got  a hole in it after one use.,41177,2
41178,Looks like plastic and feels very flimsy,41178,2
41179,sorry kind of cheap.,41179,2
41180,"I didn't realize that this came from China, I ordered a large and it looks like a small.",41180,2
41180,I will make sure for now on to find out where item is coming from.,41180,2
41180,Especially clothing.,41180,2
41180,They seem to make clothing smaller for some reason.,41180,2
41181,These are super cute but run way big!,41181,2
41181,I ordered in my standard size and have to return for a whole size smaller--I have pretty big feet!,41181,2
41182,Shown as a dress...,41182,2
41182,Nowhere near long enough!,41182,2
41182,!,41182,2
41183,"Bought this for my daughter, and she was unhappy with the material.",41183,2
41183,"She said it gathered, and fit very large.",41183,2
41184,"I'm 5'6"" and weigh about 130 lb.",41184,2
41184,I got this in large since it was made in China and figure that would compensate for how small their clothes typically are but instead the top portion fit like an regular large and the bottom part fit comfortably (I normally wear a medium) in fact the pants are more like capris which I don't mind.,41184,2
41184,The part that really bothers me though is the top.,41184,2
41184,"As shown on the model, which I should have considered, it is extremely low and revealing.",41184,2
41184,The over-lapping part is really loose so I tried using a safety pin at no avail.,41184,2
41184,And what's worst is the spaghetti straps hook on the back and can easily slip off.,41184,2
41184,I can imagine the nightmare it would be puting this back on after a bathroom trip.,41184,2
41184,All in all this was a bad purchase.,41184,2
41185,Cute slippers but fell apart after 4 days.,41185,2
41185,My granddaughter was disappointed,41185,2
41186,I ordered my usual size.,41186,2
41186,"Everything fit well, EXCEPT the V-neckline was so deep and wide.",41186,2
41186,Couldn't keep gown on my shoulders!,41186,2
41186,"Weird.,

41188,"Looks to baggy, did not like it at all!",41188,2
41189,The shirt was cute but was definitely smaller than advertised.,41189,2
41189,Company will not pay shipping for return order and it's not worth the money to ship it back.,41189,2

41189,Please note that sizes run small!,41189,2
41190,I love the color but they are to small,41190,2
41191,Was not satisfied stones were fallen and was not happy at all,41191,2

41192,I'm a size 8 1/2 -9 and I feel they barely make it over my feet.,41192,2
41192,After a few minutes they scrunch up in my shoes and I'm constantly re-fitting them.,41192,2
41192,Perhaps I need a different type of liner socks.,41192,2
41193,Lovely blouse but way to small wouldn't even close around bust and I ordered a size up.,41193,2
41193,Returned for refund.,41193,2
41194,Delivery was Quick.,41194,2
41194,I'm disappointed that the picture of this charm is so adorable but in reality you can't see any details of the little girl.,41194,2
41194,I wasn't I ordered this because I couldn't make out what I was looking at.,41194,2
41195,"I really didn't like the material, it's kind of cheap looking , a little shiny.",41195,2
41195,The waist band on the skirt is really tight.,41195,2
41195,I wouldn't buy again.,41195,2
41195,If you have any additional questions feel free to ask.,41195,2
41196,This was very cute so I ordered it for my son.,41196,2
41196,Upon washing it only once I was very disappointed to have had the color basically melt off :( now I have to buy a different first fourth onesie for him.,41196,2
41197,"This isn't that great, I was very disappointed when this arrived.",41197,2
41197,"First of all the bar, ""clicker"", part is too short for my nose and I don't even have a big nose.",41197,2
41197,"Secondly, when I got this it was so hard to un-click that even after I tried to wear it out it was still just as hard to click/un-click into place.",41197,2
41197,I got it stuck in my nose because I couldn't get it un-clicked!,41197,2
41197,"Quality isn't very good either, the design on mine was messed up with drips of the paint filling it most of the design.",41197,2
41197,"Over all I'm disappointed with this purchase, I do not recommend this to anyone.",41197,2
41198,Fell apart quickly,41198,2
41199,I was pretty excited about this leotard when I ordered it.,41199,2
41199,When we received it we adjusted the bust line with the drawstring and tried it on.,41199,2
41199,Wow was I surprised.,41199,2
41199,The torso was so short that I will not let her wear it as 1 wrong move and Chi Chi's are coming out.,41199,2
41199,I would order a size up for your little ones.,41199,2
41200,"This is not a dress for ""pear shape"" of body.",41200,2
41200,It was my mistake to get it so I had to send it back,41200,2
41201,The shirt is okay.,41201,2
41201,Wore it one time only.,41201,2
41201,Not very flattering.,41201,2
41202,"After the first wash before I even used them, they are falling a part.",41202,2
41202,They are still usable but not a great quality product by any means.,41202,2
41203,"These we're listed as 1/2"" as well as 12mm.",41203,2
41203,After receiving them they seemed a little small.,41203,2
41203,A half inch is 12.7mm so this isn't an accurate measured size.,41203,2
41203,Otherwise for the price and that this product shipped with Prime for free I can't really complain too much.,41203,2
41204,It's way to small; I'm a 36 D and I'm falling out of it.,41204,2
41205,Cute and cheap,41205,2
41206,The color ...,41206,2
41206,I am not to crazy about it,41206,2

41208,They ran large.,41208,2
41209,My con's out weight the pro's.,41209,2
41209,So this surpose to be  Sexy V Neck sleeper thingy or water ever I order in s small is not how I seen it in the picture on the model.,41209,2
41209,"First in Foremost, it was loose on me okay.",41209,2
41209,"I'm a small girl, I'm 5""4 and weight about 120 lbs okay.",41209,2
41209,It had a little bit of small brown stain like somebody accidentally dropped some bleach on it on the side okay.,41209,2
41209,The sleeves didn't come long as it is on the model.,41209,2
41209,The sleeves stopped at my wrist okay.,41209,2
41209,AND if I was to lift my arms up the material by your vagina would lift into it and it hurts.,41209,2
41209,I guess the good thing I could say about this material is that it's a onesie I guess but I wouldn't buy another one from this company.,41209,2
41210,"Very uncomfortable; hot and sweaty under clothing, and bunches uncomfirtably when you sit down.",41210,2
41211,too small for the size,41211,2
41212,"color is far more orange than ""coral"" and fit is way smaller than the other 2 I bought at the same time.",41212,2
41212,"I ordered a size larger than I would normally take, and it was still very uncomfortable.",41212,2
41212,Sending back was much more difficult than it should have been.. Make sure you ask for postage paid if you need a refund.,41212,2
41213,I love this belt!,41213,2
41213,Isn't it cute!,41213,2
41213,Everything is just right about this belt except for what is wrong with it which makes me hate it!,41213,2
41213,"The one flaw is the little thingy that goes in the belt hole, well it is sharp and Scratches the belt buckle ALL over the place!",41213,2
41213,It's a really cute belt buckle too!,41213,2
41214,I waited it seemed like forever for this.,41214,2
41214,It fits somewhat small and a button was missing!!,41214,2
41214,I was not too thrilled and may rethink purchasing anything else.,41214,2
41214,It is super cute and works for a casual outfit for work but I'm pretty bummed I had to sew another button on.,41214,2
41215,Really cheap.,41215,2
41215,One of the lenses fell out when I was cleaning them off.,41215,2
41215,"The nose bridge is also not placed correctly in the design, so they ride high on the nose.",41215,2
41215,"For a dollar or two these would have been fine, but they are way over priced.",41215,2
41216,They are good glasses but fairly cheap in its construction.,41216,2

41220,Looking for something else.,41220,2
41221,Super cute but definitely not for long torsos.,41221,2
41221,Was hoping it'd be longer and more loose.,41221,2
41222,If I had a small head it would be ok.,41222,2
41222,"I have a big mug, not even close.",41222,2
41222,"Made in China, very inexpensive, so didn't mind the risk.",41222,2
41222,Will give it away to an Oompa Loompa.,41222,2
41223,It's cute but runs small,41223,2
41224,If you have a small head you'll need to cinch the back to the point where the extra length on the tab will not fit in the opening to hide it and it looks odd.,41224,2
41224,"It's not a tight fit either, if it's windy the hat will fly right off.",41224,2
41225,I'm 5'7 200lbs and order the XL it was a little tight and ways short.,41225,2
41225,Not exactly flowy and loose like the picture,41225,2
41226,Smaller that the image like,41226,2
41227,The bracelet itself is very cute and my daughter was extremely excited when she opened the box.,41227,2
41227,"Unfortunately within an hour of wearing it, one side of the leather strand that has the ""love"" charm on it came unattached from the silver base that holds the strands together.",41227,2
41228,Did not fit well at all and was not comfortable.,41228,2
41228,Too bulky to wear under anything too thin or form fitting.,41228,2
41229,"This is a great dress in the picture it shows, but I personally don't think it's anything like the image shown.",41229,2
41229,"It's too big, and I ordered a small.",41229,2
41229,"I'm 5'3"".",41229,2

41229,I was very disappointed.,41229,2
41229,:(,41229,2
41230,"It is pretty to look at, but had an awkward fit.",41230,2
41230,"I was hopefully for it to be flowy, but it seems to cling onto me in places that weren't flattering.",41230,2
41231,I've had other carhartt pants usually a size 32.,41231,2
41231,Those fit pretty good but we're starting to feel a little tight after washing.,41231,2
41231,So I ordered these in a 33 and before washing them they are tighter than my 32s?!?,41231,2
41231,"Worst part is, because I already ripped off the tags assuming they would fit fine like my other ones I can't return them...",41231,2
41232,Beware Big busted ladies!,41232,2
41232,"While this nightgown is super cute, it has a line across the bust that is supposed to go at the bottom of the bust....but unless you want to have a little too much cleavage up top, the line isn't going down there...and it looks silly having the line across the bust.",41232,2
41232,I am a 36G and 6 months pregnant.,41232,2
41232,I returned this.,41232,2
41233,"bottom a little snug, top good",41233,2
41234,Fairly disappointed.,41234,2
41234,"The company is nice, they have good customer service, and the packaging is top notch, but their overall brand is cheapened by lackluster products.",41234,2
41234,These shirts look way 'cooler' in the photos than what you actually get.,41234,2
41234,I expected them to be longer and more form fitting.,41234,2
41234,"They are presented to look thinner and more stylish than normal Hawaiian shirts in the pictures, which is why I ordered them, but when they arrived, they looked just like standard (corny/unflattering) Hawaiian shirts.",41234,2
41234,Cheap quality buttons and threading as well.,41234,2
41234,The buttons got caught in the loose thread in the holes on both shirts I ordered.,41234,2
41234,Was afraid to pull them through for fear of the buttons falling off.,41234,2
41234,Was not impressed.,41234,2
41235,Super pretty.,41235,2
41235,I got a small and it was tight on the waist and the cleavage has no support and it was see through.,41235,2
41235,You could see the padding and couldn't wear a Bra.,41235,2
41235,My size 34C boobs couldn't hold it up.,41235,2
41236,the sleeves were way too long and don't look right,41236,2
41237,When I opened the box the beak was broken off and it looked as though it had been broken before because there was glue where the beak use to be.,41237,2
41237,I returned it.,41237,2
41238,"I wish this top had been a little thicker, its a pretty top but it was so thin.",41238,2
41238,I knew it wouldn't last me long so I had to return it.,41238,2
41239,The peplum hit too low so it flared out at an unflattering place on the hip.,41239,2
41239,It made the wisest part of my body look even larger.,41239,2
41239,If the top has been just two inches shorter it would have been perfect.,41239,2
41239,"I was also disappointed by the material which was just a cotton jersey that didn't hold the shape of the Garmet well, from the pictures I thought it was going to be more rigid and structured.",41239,2
41240,"Top too small, not for big chest",41240,2
41241,Runs very small by 2 sizes too small.,41241,2
41241,I wear a 10/12 and ordered xl since it said fits 14/16 but gosh this fits more like a 6/8.,41241,2
41241,The zipper kept sticking and white fur sheds everywhere.,41241,2
41241,Itchy when on very cheaply made.,41241,2

41244,It says it's for a 9 month old but it seems like it could fit a 2 year old.,41244,2
41244,Won't be able to wear this for a while!,41244,2
41244,Buy a size smaller than you think.,41244,2
41245,vey poor thin quality falling apart,41245,2
41246,The color is way of from the picture it doesnt match my watch:-(,41246,2
41247,Dress was gorgeous it fit me beautifully.,41247,2
41247,My problem was the corset backing goes far beyond the bodice.,41247,2
41247,It laces down about half way to your bum.,41247,2
41247,My bum caused the bottom of the corset to bunch up and it made me look like I had a tail.,41247,2
41247,It seems such a long corset backing would only work for someone who does not have a well endowed backside.,41247,2
41247,Besides that I loved it.,41247,2
41247,I wish it worked out for me.,41247,2
41247,Ended up returning it.,41247,2
41247,Seller was attentive and understanding.,41247,2

41250,Gave it away,41250,2
41251,Had to return - The port for my ear buds is too small.,41251,2
41251,So I can't have the cover on if I want to use my ear buds.,41251,2
41251,Quite annoying.,41251,2
41252,The material was much thinner than I expected.,41252,2
41253,"Brim too short, bonnet runs small, and serger seams can be seen in the back.",41253,2
41253,Makes it look cheap.,41253,2
41254,Terrible material that clings to everything and it had a snag down the side however I spent less than $5 on it so its not worth returning.,41254,2
41255,Small,41255,2
41256,Beautiful Jacket.,41256,2
41256,wonderful detail.,41256,2

41260,Made cheap and looks cheap,41260,2
41261,"based on recommendations I order a size up, and it was too big, but also I didn't like the fabric it looked cheap",41261,2
41262,material very very very cheap.,41262,2
41262,just like the price.,41262,2
41262,the ends fold up.,41262,2

41264,Ordered a 4C and fit more like a 1x.,41264,2

41277,"It's a nice bag, but not worth $56.99.",41277,2
41277,"Also, the cross-body strap is too short for me.",41277,2
41277,"I am 5-foot-7, size 14.",41277,2
41278,"It may just be the style, but the fabric was very thin, the cut was very small and the quality seemed lacking.",41278,2
41278,I expect better from Ralph Lauren.,41278,2
41279,Not great.,41279,2
41279,The Stargate itself is not very visible.,41279,2
41280,No,41280,2

41282,I'm not totally happy with it probably will give it away,41282,2
41283,Too small,41283,2
41284,Product looked nice when it arrived but could not fit the size they advertised.,41284,2
41285,Ok to use if traveling with women's watches.,41285,2
41285,Does not close well when hold men's watches.,41285,2
41285,Very difficult to close and had to make manual adjustments by punching extra hole on closing strap to be able to close case.,41285,2
41286,It's ok for price.,41286,2
41286,Many ways to wear it if you have time to style it,41286,2
41287,Runs very small,41287,2
41288,Too small,41288,2

41291,The length of these swimsuits are not produced ed for European amicans.,41291,2

41294,super bulky,41294,2
41295,"Not true to size (entirely too small), but it's too expensive to exchange the dress with the seller (you have to pay shipping each way, and if you don't have the original tags, they won't take it back).",41295,2
41295,This was a hugely frustrating shopping experience.,41295,2
41295,I would not recommend this product.,41295,2
41296,The top is super cute but the bottoms don't cover your butt at all.,41296,2
41296,The top is like a pink one you'd get from Walmart.,41296,2
41296,No joke it's the same thing,41296,2
41297,I'm a small  the cut is for Chinese women smaller frame.,41297,2
41297,I never recieved the first order so I was sent another and recieved it only to not be able to wear.,41297,2
41297,I'm sorry I spend the money.,41297,2
41297,It's a beautiful coat and would have gone up a size but it was discontinue I guess.,41297,2
41297,I'm gona fine some one who can wear it.,41297,2
41297,I didn't want the trouble of sending it back took long to recieved as well.,41297,2
41298,The waist part is great!,41298,2
41298,The thigh area is small for someone curvy.,41298,2
41298,Also didn't see any lift in my butt at all.,41298,2
41298,A bit disappointed.,41298,2
41299,"The sizing was good, it fit my husband's overlarge head.",41299,2
41299,"But it looks odd, as if the shape isn't what it's supposed to be.",41299,2
41299,So he decided he didn't like it.,41299,2
41299,"I thought I would keep it for myself, except the same is true when I put it on, it's the hat, not the head it goes on.",41299,2
41299,So I'm returning.,41299,2
41299,Also... NOT 100% WOOL as posted.,41299,2
41300,"This shirt--in large-- was too small for my teenaged daughter, who is 5'7"" and 120 pounds.",41300,2
41300,"The lace is also on the outside of the sleeves so it sticks up on the outside of the seam, easily catching on things.",41300,2
41301,No support in the top.,41301,2
41302,"1st one arrived broken, the 2nd one broke 1st time wearing it",41302,2
41303,It's very cheaply made n not very flattering.,41303,2
41303,"It's too bad that the ""belt"" is only on the front n doesn't go all the way around.",41303,2
41304,I ordered a large because I'm tall but it's just wide..,41304,2
41304,It's not long.,41304,2
41304,Like the pants half barely covers half my calf :/ like its comfy but it's not cute because of the high water affect.,41304,2
41304,Made of nice t shirt material?,41304,2
41304,I'll probably just look at American apparel honestly.,41304,2
41305,Kinda cheep,41305,2
41306,"CHEEP MADE,TANGLES ONLY GO HALF WAY AROUND",41306,2
41307,"Comfortable, but really-- they are not compressive enough.",41307,2
41307,"I bought size small/medium and I am 5'4"" at 155lbs postpartum, 9 days... waist is at 40"".",41307,2
41307,"I was hoping these would really suck me in and help me recover, so far they are just expensive panties.",41307,2
41308,"It does look like the picture, but it is sooo tiny, I cannot get the drawstring waist over my boobs -
the waist is fixed and tiny
I read the too small comment and ordered the 3x - it is barely a size 10 if that in normal sizes,,,,",41308,2
41309,"Loved it was super cute
Owl fell out after 3 Rd time wearing.",41309,2
41309,Great for price though and super cute!,41309,2
41309,!,41309,2
41310,The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames that I don't like.,41310,2
41311,This product I did not care for.,41311,2
41311,I don't write many negative reviews.,41311,2
41311,The sleeves are a little too long.,41311,2
41311,"Also, take note that it is 100% polyester, as it really looks like it is made of plastic.",41311,2
41311,"The buttons were gold, very gold.",41311,2
41311,"I didn't expect much, as the price is nice, as far as Blazers go, but it looked cheaper than I expected.",41311,2
41311,"I don't normally buy expensive coats, even though I wear them constantly for work.",41311,2
41311,the last one I purchased was only $100.00 and it did not look cheap.,41311,2
41311,I will spend the extra twenty bucks.,41311,2
41312,The material on this thing feels like matted butt hair on a Muppet.,41312,2
41312,It literally feels gross.,41312,2
41313,It feels a bit cheep.,41313,2
41313,It also is a bit smaller and tighter then I was expecting.,41313,2
41314,Broke after about a week of wearing.,41314,2
41314,"I did not bang into anything, etc and it literally fell off my ankle because it had some how broke.",41314,2
41314,The leaves would get tangled with the chain sometimes too.,41314,2
41314,"It did arrive far sooner than expected, however.",41314,2
41315,"The price was great, but I'm not sure I will even wear them.",41315,2
41315,"I'm 5'10"", 180 lbs, size 12 in pants.",41315,2
41315,These underwear do not fit.,41315,2
41315,They either roll down or cut into my sides.,41315,2
41316,Like it I ordered two and both were broken during mailing process.,41316,2
41316,not happy at all.,41316,2
41316,Love the necklace but they were damaged when arrived to me.,41316,2
41317,I'm very disappointed with Wilson's quality control.,41317,2
41317,"My daughter ordered a similar jacket from Wilson in large and could not
get it to zip as it was too small so we went up to the extra large on the next order.",41317,2
41317,"The exact jacket in extra large was much
too large and the quality of the leather was poor.",41317,2
41317,"This jacket quality is nice but it was much too large but we didn't want to order the large for fear that it would
be too small so we just gave up.",41317,2
41317,Now I'm stuck paying to send these two back.,41317,2
41318,Shirt was not what I expected.,41318,2
41318,Product arrived on time.,41318,2
41319,The waist was very small,41319,2
41320,I give it to stars because it is a soft sweater but it's not a sweater dress it's more like a sweater I even ordered an extra large and I'm a size medium and it still fit me like a sweater that a sweater dress so I don't know if I would buy this,41320,2
41321,Very flimsy and cheaply,41321,2
41322,"I bought the tan color in March and, overall, have really enjoyed it until a few weeks ago when the inside lining ripped all the way across the top.",41322,2
41322,It happened so quickly that it totally shocked me!,41322,2
41322,The rip is right above the inside zippered pocket.,41322,2
41322,I tried sewing it but it's like the material is rotten and it just ripped again.,41322,2
41322,I'm so disappointed!,41322,2
41322,I'm afraid to order another one because it may do the same thing after only six months.,41322,2
41322,"Also the zipper pull fell off of the side, netted pocket.",41322,2
41322,I would give this purse at least 4 stars if it hadn't ripped but now that I have to throw it away it only gets two.,41322,2
41323,It's cute and will work for what I wanted it for.,41323,2
41323,But the construction is cheap (you get what you  pay for) and the  chain and fabric strap is too short.,41323,2
41323,Also the hooks on the chain are not strong enough.,41323,2
41323,"But for the price and that I bought 3 with a gift card,  I'll work with it.",41323,2
41324,It's nice just runs a little short and is very guy shaped.,41324,2
41324,Makes me look like a linebacker.,41324,2
41325,"Good looking jacket but large men size was too small for my husbands 5'10, 190# frame.",41325,2
41325,Fit me 5'6 135#,41325,2
41326,This sweater is not sewed very well.,41326,2
41326,The hem at the bottom is apart.,41326,2
41326,And loose strings are all over the sweater.,41326,2
41326,If the are pulled more gems will come apart,41326,2
41327,"The shoulder straps tie at the top of the shoulder, and it looks somewhat silly",41327,2
41328,Awkward and harder to use than a standard key holder.,41328,2
41328,"It's appealing to have a pocket and open with zipper, but I recommend one just stick with a regular leather folding key holder with snaps.",41328,2
41329,Smaller than expected but luckily I don't carry a lot of stuff.,41329,2
41329,Really cute.,41329,2
41329,No odd odor that normally comes with online purses.,41329,2
41329,Update: the metal part of the shoulder strap broke and the handles on the zipper keeo falling off.,41329,2
41330,The bottom fit great but the top was way too big!,41330,2
41330,I usually wear a 38 DD bra and 16 bottom.,41330,2
41330,I ordered a XL (16/18),41330,2
41331,I thought this looked cheap and ugly.,41331,2
41331,"The face is pretty big (and I have big wrists), so it was attention-getting and not cute enough to warrant that.",41331,2
41331,The strap looked and felt like plastic.,41331,2
41332,Very cheaply made... Too small and very tight fitting.,41332,2
41333,"The material does not fit snug, and it's best for people who are about 5' 6"".",41333,2
41333,"I'm a lean 5' 10"" and the material is saggy on my hamstrings and the length reaches me mid-calf so will be returning.",41333,2
41334,Was very small even though I order a large,41334,2
41335,"Cheaply made, don't waste your money.",41335,2
41336,"They looked good, but just after the return window closed one of the pearls detached from the stud.",41336,2
41337,I love the feathers and the colors.,41337,2
41337,Its a weird fit though.,41337,2
41337,I bought a size up and its tight but not bad in the chest.,41337,2
41337,The arms are super baggy though.,41337,2
41337,Its also a cheap fabric and kinda feels like wearing a shower curtain :(,41337,2
41338,Not everything was included like it said online.,41338,2
41338,It only gives you half the tools it said was included but all the rings.,41338,2
41338,But you get what you pay for.,41338,2
41339,"Cute, but doesn't stay hooked",41339,2
41340,Poorly mad socks.,41340,2
41340,"Stretch out with wear, became unraveled at first wash. Don't Buy!",41340,2
41341,They broke after two weeks that is so not okay.,41341,2
41342,slip off my feat,41342,2
41343,It's much bigger than I expected and not as pretty as I'd hoped.,41343,2
41344,"The lining was quite see-through, but for the price, it's about what I expected.",41344,2
41344,I am 6' tall and my measurements are 49/38/51.,41344,2
41344,It fit me but was extremely short which tends to happen when you're as tall and stacked as I am.,41344,2
41344,I bought it in the hopes of wearing it to a wedding but it would be better suited for a shorter woman to wear out at to a nightclub or somewhere dark where the lack of quality would be less obvious.,41344,2
41345,Had to return immediately.,41345,2
41346,"I bought these tank tops because they were advertised as ""extra long"".",41346,2
41346,"I'm 5'3""  and they go to the top of my hip, so I really wouldn't call them long.",41346,2
41346,I'm generally and xs in most Tshirts and the small is very tight.,41346,2
41346,The material is fine and they'll work as an undershirt but they definitely not what I expected.,41346,2
41346,Disappointing,41346,2
41347,"These are okay, not really what I thought they would be as far as the material.",41347,2
41348,Shoes are very nice looking but extremely narrow and could not wear them.,41348,2
41349,It's not the real ones so they don't stay on too well.,41349,2
41349,I tried to save a little money but it was a waste of money.,41349,2
41349,:(,41349,2
41350,"What I liked: came early (by a couple of weeks), cheap, pretty

What I didn't like: it is way too small.",41350,2
41350,"Okay, I'm a big girl so I got the 3x bc I usually wear a 1x or a 2x but I wanted to get it a little bigger so I can have a little wiggle room.",41350,2
41350,"Yeah, it fits more like a large.",41350,2
41350,I can't even get it on.,41350,2
41350,I'm in a wedding next month and now I have no idea what to do.,41350,2
41350,"Yes, it was cheap, but I was definitely expecting it to be at least a little more true to size.",41350,2
41351,Very cute pants but very short!,41351,2
41352,Color on photo looked charcoal.,41352,2
41352,It was boring grey,41352,2
41353,The arms are absurdly short.,41353,2
41353,Very disappointed.,41353,2
41354,Run's way to small on size M.  I also did not like the quality at all seems very cheap.,41354,2
41355,Bad buy on my part.,41355,2
41355,I didn't really read the description.,41355,2
41355,So here's the deal.,41355,2
41355,This is two pieces of aluminum with a rubber band lol.,41355,2
41355,I decided to keep for an emergency wallet for going trail running or hiking.,41355,2
41355,I'd imagine that's what it's meant for not every day use.,41355,2
41356,rather itch and not rabbit fur or rabbit fur blend.,41356,2
41356,They are very long and stretch but not warm.,41356,2
41357,Arrived broken.,41357,2
41357,Would have been nice.,41357,2
41357,Need to repair the clasp.,41357,2
41358,"Cute, but only one or two of the snaps worked.",41358,2
41358,Quality isn't there for the price.,41358,2
41359,Cheap,41359,2
41360,Cute shirt runs small.,41360,2
41360,"I ordered a 2x I normally wear size XL/14... it fits short, but fits with a longer cami underneath.",41360,2
41361,"I am not expecting a high quality product but when I received this, the product seems
Tonhabe beennoacked before the product had a chance to cool off.",41361,2
41361,It was all stucked together.,41361,2
41361,The printed stars on the skirt is not even screen printed right.,41361,2
41361,It's all stucked together.,41361,2
41362,REALLY short.,41362,2
41362,Cannot wear as a dress.,41362,2
41362,Belt is also necessary.,41362,2
41363,ran small,41363,2
41364,"They all seemed used, they are rusty and one of them was missing the crystal .",41364,2
41365,The hoodie to small!,41365,2
41365,The rest of the products I ordered was great!,41365,2
41366,"This jumpsuit does not have a loose/wide pant leg as advertised/pictured; its just a regular size width pant leg, not what I was expecting.",41366,2
41366,"I'm 5'7"" 150 lbs with an average torso.. the XL fit perfect in size but the pants were too short, falls right on the top of my feet which is too short for my style.",41366,2
41366,I will have to wear a flat shoe with this jumpsuit to be even half way attractive but prefer wide leg pants.,41366,2
41366,2-stars because it arrived 3 days before scheduled date.,41366,2
41367,"I'm 5'9"", 200 lb, size 14 Apt 9 jeans, fairly fit with a little belly fat.",41367,2
41367,I ordered these in the 3X denim with paisley pattern.,41367,2
41367,"I guessed on sizing given the reviews here, the myriad of other plus size jersey pants available here on Amazon, and no chart from the seller.",41367,2
41367,"At a 3X, these were comfortable in the waist, but too small in the hips/thighs - total cameltoe (probablyTMI).",41367,2
41367,"The material is also a little thin, but soft and slinky.",41367,2
41367,Love this pattern.,41367,2
41367,The length would allow for me to wear a 6 inch heel and still probably be stepping on the hems.,41367,2
41367,"Because the pattern is at the hems, I would lose half the pattern if I hemmed them.",41367,2
41367,"Returning for a refund, and won't try again.",41367,2
41368,Doesn't look very cute on.,41368,2
41368,"It's kind of boxylooking, needs darts sewn in or to  be altered to fit.",41368,2
41369,Way too small,41369,2
41370,"Missing all of the accessories that claim to be included, not a huge deal (just wanted what I paid for).",41370,2
41371,Way too large to be a medium.,41371,2
41371,Not just a fluke either as I had tried three shirts and all were way too large...,41371,2
41372,"They looked great, but the top of the heart poked my nipple so much that it actually bled.",41372,2
41372,It was almost as though the bar holes in the shield should have been lower as to address this.,41372,2
41372,I had plenty of room on the non pointed side.,41372,2
41373,Cheap fabric,41373,2
41374,Non USA sizing of 7x was really 2-3 X at best.,41374,2
41374,Didn't return gave to another family memener,41374,2
41375,Stuck with it not worth the shipping cost to exchange or lame refund they will offer.,41375,2
41375,The material is really thin their pictures are misleading.,41375,2
41375,Ill need to wear a slip under neath.,41375,2
41375,I suggest you order 2 sizes up to achieve the baggy bat wing top and to wear off the shoulders.,41375,2
41376,Bright saturated yellow with glaring purple flowers.. not a nice pale yellow like the photo.,41376,2
41376,Material seems ok.. cheap flannel which is what I wanted.. but the colors will have to be bleached so I can live with them.,41376,2
41377,Cool design but too small.,41377,2
41377,I'm sending it back.,41377,2
41378,This is very thin and see through.,41378,2
41378,Pretty poor quality.,41378,2
41378,It's also extremely small.,41378,2
41378,"I wouldn't buy it again, that's for sure.",41378,2
41379,shirt got a hole in it the second time it was washed.,41379,2
41380,They are much smaller than my American Apparel socks.,41380,2
41380,They are synthetic too.,41380,2
41380,Not real dancer socks.,41380,2
41380,If you are short and not athletic in your legs or a young girl these are for you.,41380,2
41380,They have made marks on my legs that i do not like,41380,2
41381,Too narrow.,41381,2
41381,Useless.,41381,2
41382,Too ship,41382,2
41383,My dress was torn in the lace on the shoulder.,41383,2
41383,Very un happy that it came that way,41383,2
41384,Pretty.,41384,2
41384,Quality is not the best but worth the price to me but it runs very small.,41384,2
41385,"These leggings would certainly have been warm, but they were just too tight to be comfortable.",41385,2
41385,"I'm 5' 8 1/2"" and weight 120 lbs.",41385,2
41385,So I'm pretty thin.,41385,2
41385,"But these really pressed in all over, quite uncomfortable.",41385,2
41385,I returned them.,41385,2
41386,The material was a bit cheap.,41386,2
41386,The fit was too large and boxy.,41386,2
41386,Returning.,41386,2
41387,Run very tight cuts off circulation,41387,2
41388,Too big for someone of my size.,41388,2
41388,5' and 120 lb.,41388,2
41388,"It's cute, but only if I were taller.",41388,2
41389,Very first impression once received is how incredibly soft and stretchy the material is.,41389,2
41389,Immediately I want to put them on because I'm expecting to be on cloud 9.,41389,2
41389,"When you initially put them on they do not disappoint, they feel great and fit comfortably.",41389,2
41389,"The material doesn't feel constricting and breathable, especially on a very hot day.",41389,2
41389,The next thing you notice is the extra material on the inside that is supposed to keep your privates in place do so by have material up on either sides of your member.,41389,2
41389,This extra material shoved up into your crevices quickly become uncomfortable but you think you can get over it with how great and soft the fabric is.,41389,2
41389,"As you wear them more though, the fabric slowly starts creeping up your legs until they are bunched up and greatly increase your rage with the fabric shoved into your crevices.",41389,2
41389,Another note is the little anchors do not last and quickly start to fall off.,41389,2
41389,You end up with a pair of blue underwear that has peeling white dots all over it.,41389,2
41389,"If I were you, stick to your cheaper fruit of the looms and be more comfortable.",41389,2
41390,Way too snug!,41390,2
41390,"I wear a large in everything else...sometimes even a medium, but it looks like I should've gone with XL on this at least.",41390,2
41391,Thin material,41391,2
41392,"I think it will look cute on a lot of people, but it was an absolute no for me.",41392,2
41392,"If you have a longer torso, beware the camel toe!",41392,2
41392,It was extremely uncomfortable not to mention unflattering.,41392,2
41392,"No matter how cute the rest of it was, no woman wants to go in public with extreme camel toe.",41392,2
41393,Good but short and small,41393,2
41394,This is more annoying to get something in/out of than it's worth.,41394,2
41394,I have a Note 5 that fits but hard to get in/out.,41394,2
41394,The zipper itself is huge and looks more gaudy in person than the pics show.,41394,2
41394,I hate this thing.,41394,2
41395,I am very unhappy with the shipping.,41395,2
41395,The product came broken with 3 beads displaced.,41395,2
41395,"Also, one of the white rhinestones looks very dull and damaged.",41395,2
41396,I searched and searched for 100% cotton toe socks.,41396,2
41396,"I purchased these, because they are specifically described by item number as being 100% cotton!",41396,2
41396,They are not!!,41396,2
41396,The package lists a cotton-spandex blend.,41396,2
41396,I'm disappointed in this fact.,41396,2
41396,"The socks themselves fit nicely, however, I would have purchased a different brand had they been described properly on the product description.",41396,2
41397,The hat was very small on my 10 month old.,41397,2
41397,Hat is of nice quality but would fit a 3 month old...,41397,2
41398,"This top is not actually the size ordered, size large fits like a medium.",41398,2
41399,not leather,41399,2
41400,I ordered based off of the recommendations on the size chart.,41400,2
41400,"A XXXL would have been more appropriate, and I'm 5'1'', and weigh 124.",41400,2
41400,This shirt is short and much too snug.,41400,2
41401,"Cute print, really short.",41401,2
41401,Came earlier than expected,41401,2
41402,i got an 2x .. it was a xl,41402,2
41403,Volume was nice!,41403,2
41403,Planty of room.,41403,2
41403,Wish it was more moisture proof!,41403,2
41403,"During coffee my bag sat outside, after 25 min.",41403,2
41403,I found that everything inside was damp or wet.,41403,2
41403,I strongly recommended to waterproof your bag before heading out.,41403,2
41403,"Otherwise I love it, it was easy to carry!",41403,2
41403,!,41403,2
41404,This item came on time and looks and fits as described reason for 2 stars.,41404,2
41404,However it came with a hole in the back of the material.,41404,2
41404,I'm very particular with my clothing no matter how much I spend for it so I don't think I would be wearing this.,41404,2
41405,I'm going to have to return this because it is too small.,41405,2
41405,"The size chart states that that Large should fit a 42"" chest and a 36"" waist.",41405,2
41405,"My man has a 31"" waist, and this doesn't fit at all.",41405,2
41405,It's way too small.,41405,2
41406,cute design but item is too big.,41406,2
41406,I ordered a large and I am around a size 12/13,41406,2
41407,"Cheap looking,  pockets in back are small , im shaped like model in pic it's not flattering.",41407,2
41407,"I'm 5'9 and they are too short for me, I like them about a inch pass my ankle.",41407,2
41407,Sending back,41407,2
41408,This purse was lovely and seemed well-made.,41408,2
41408,"But, the banana-yellow of the zipper did not match the mustard yellow of the purse.",41408,2
41408,"I liked it enough that had I been able to order another one with the same color zipper, I would have done so.",41408,2
41408,"The seller was nice and polite, and I received a full refund without any trouble.",41408,2
41408,Maybe another color would be a better choice.,41408,2
41409,"Image was red, dress was blue.",41409,2
41409,Cut was off and seemed cheaply made.,41409,2
41409,"Needed to wear something under as it showed off ""the cheeks"" in the sheer part.",41409,2
41410,"Washed according to directions, but they still stretched out after 1 wear.",41410,2
41410,"I'm an average height (5'4"") but a lightweight (115lbs pre pregnancy), but I feel as if these were made for someone a lot taller and thicker than I am.",41410,2
41410,They didn't really give me any support and the silicon area was much too high for where my incision was made.,41410,2
41410,I ended up wearing the support belt the hospital gave me for 6 weeks instead.,41410,2
41411,The dress was nice it was too small.,41411,2
41411,And too tight,41411,2
41412,One of the stones fell out within a few days.,41412,2
41412,I have started the refund process.,41412,2
41413,It was to small,41413,2
41414,Material stuck together,41414,2
41415,I received my clicker 2 days ago and I was so happy when I got it but the jewel has already fallen out and I'm really disappointed.,41415,2
41415,Kind of feel like I wasted my money.,41415,2
41416,"Unfortunately, these are not very comfortable.",41416,2
41416,"The fit is on the small side, especially around the legs.",41416,2
41416,Will definitely not buy them again!,41416,2
41417,Not a great fit and the small is too large.,41417,2
41418,Bought just before a trip should of taken my time to find a better product.,41418,2
41418,Very disappointed with change container and bills have no place to put them unless you fold your bills.,41418,2
41418,Serves well for a passport and 3 credit cards but nothing else.,41418,2
41419,The skirt waist is too small,41419,2
41420,the billowy sleeves as pictured is not the same - so the billowly look of the top is really not the same.,41420,2
41420,pretty average.,41420,2
41420,not worth the spend,41420,2
41421,Nice shirt just doesn't fit well - but it's nice.,41421,2
41421,"Recommend look closely at neckline,,,just not for me,,,too wide for my taste on top.",41421,2
41422,It was too small and not as thick as it seemed in the picture,41422,2
41423,"The bottom fit perfectly, the top was way too small, I ordered 2 sizes up",41423,2
41424,Seems like a fine jacket for price but the small is WAY bigger than a 36 to 38 inch chest.,41424,2
41424,Fits like a XL.,41424,2
41424,Gotta go buy a new jacket now,41424,2
41425,These are not leggings.,41425,2
41425,These are tights.,41425,2
41425,Completely see through.,41425,2
41425,All of it.,41425,2
41425,Top to bottom.,41425,2
41426,Too flimsy.,41426,2
41426,Was folded into thirds when it arrived.,41426,2
41426,Clearly not very sturdy.,41426,2
41426,Sent it back.,41426,2
41427,Was very disappointed at the shrinkage of these socks.,41427,2
41427,"Did not wash in hot water, not put in
hot dryer.",41427,2
41427,"Came nicely boxed, tho!",41427,2
41428,Iron on decal.,41428,2
41429,Weight of the dress is very thin and cheap feeling.,41429,2
41429,While it does stretch as it is a BodyCon dress be mindful that the print does stretch a bit looking a bit cheap.,41429,2
41429,Love the print and the style but just too cheap feeling for me.,41429,2
41430,size runs super small.,41430,2
41430,I ordered a 5 for my  5 year old daughter; as that is what she normally wears and it fits my 3 year old better.,41430,2
41431,I ordered a XL and it fit like a Med.,41431,2
41432,I really wanted to like this bag but I just couldn't.,41432,2
41432,this will be my first return.,41432,2
41432,The material used is way to rough.,41432,2
41432,And the zipper that closes the bag is a joke.,41432,2
41432,It just closes the middle and leaves two huge gaps on either side.,41432,2
41432,Very dissapointed.,41432,2
41432,However if you can get over it rubbing your shoulder raw the inside of the bag is great.,41432,2
41432,Has a lot of room and great organization.,41432,2
41433,You get what you pay for here.,41433,2
41434,"These bras are comfy and easy to use for nursing, the problem I have with these are that all 3 unraveled within 2 weeks.",41434,2
41434,I won't be purchasing them again.,41434,2
41434,Also the snaps aren't always snug so the cup will come loose randomly..,41434,2
41435,Flimsy material.,41435,2
41435,I returned it.,41435,2
41436,I don't like it a all.,41436,2
41436,"There are other amber products that you can get, avoid this one.",41436,2
41437,These were too thick for my earring holes.,41437,2
41437,I haven't had that problem with other earrings before.,41437,2
41437,It hurt to put them on.,41437,2
41438,It's pretty cheap - just a printed on logo (not like the picture) and the size is way too big.,41438,2
41438,Fits more like an XL than a Medium,41438,2
41439,"very large on me - 5'6"" & 110 pounds - and it's totally see through",41439,2
41440,"Size runs small, pattern was different and too pricey compared to other seller with the same product.",41440,2
41440,Good quality tho.,41440,2
41441,So disappointed they are constantly coming unscrewed and I'm down to 1 pair.,41441,2
41442,Over priced.,41442,2
41442,belt had a cheap plastic buckle I don't think it will last very long,41442,2
41443,"The straps are uneven, and are awkwardly positioned.",41443,2
41443,Poor quality product,41443,2
41444,"I think there is something wrong with the size, it makes my butt like square shape !",41444,2
41444,Cuz it's too small :(,41444,2
41445,returned,41445,2
41446,Packaged horribly.,41446,2
41446,Created creases in the visor that can't be removed.,41446,2
41446,"The visor scratches crazy easily, and is straight from China.",41446,2
41446,Paper lining that covers the exterior isn't easy to remove.,41446,2
41447,too short - things fall out,41447,2
41448,the stone was not in place when I received it!,41448,2
41448,!,41448,2
41449,Back zipper fell off after a couple uses!,41449,2
41450,"I used it for my nose & it looks very real except it actually pierced halfway through my nose and left an infection, I would recommend just getting it pierced",41450,2
41451,Looks too big,41451,2
41452,Material is nice but I'm disappointed.,41452,2
41452,I'm 155 usually a midium.,41452,2
41452,First of all the fitting is crazy I got 10 which was soo loose everywhere.,41452,2
41452,Then I returned and orders 8 it was free around my belly and tight around arms,41452,2
41453,NOT AS EXPECTED,41453,2
41454,Looks nothing like the picture.,41454,2
41454,The collar is much smaller - the feature I was most excited about - and it apparently runs very small,41454,2
41455,I bought this for a Vegas pool party and I didn't end up wearing it.,41455,2
41455,The torso was really short.,41455,2
41455,The fabric was cheap feeling and also the straps didn't seem to do anything.,41455,2
41455,Also the bust was really tight fitting and smothered my chest.,41455,2
41455,"I'm 5'4"", 32 D, 125lbs.",41455,2
41456,Eh,41456,2
41457,Looks like it is from a bubble gum machine.,41457,2
41458,Leaves a gap .,41458,2
41458,I prefer my hoop jewelry to close.,41458,2
41458,Looks so weird having a huge gap like a hook nose ring,41458,2
41459,it would have been nice to know I was getting 3 different sizes before I ordered,41459,2
41460,Fit as expected however quality isn't that great.,41460,2
41460,Only wore three or four times and noticed holes around the hood attachment and pockets.,41460,2
41461,was not happy with the design.,41461,2
41461,Low quality,41461,2
41462,No support,41462,2
41463,It was too small and I didn't really like the style when I put it on.,41463,2
41463,The white part hanging out the bottom was too long and voluminous.,41463,2
41463,"The lining underneath, covering the chest area would not stay closed which was visually obvious.",41463,2
41464,Wish it was made better.,41464,2
41465,Way to big and unwearable.,41465,2
41465,No return information so can't exchange for a smaller size or refund.,41465,2
41466,"Cute outfit, should have been at least one full size bigger for our 2 year old.",41466,2
41466,"Okay for pajamas, but not an outfit.",41466,2
41467,Got a whole on the leg from first use :(,41467,2
41468,It was pretty baggy and the straps we're look and had to be pinned.,41468,2
41468,There should be more size options.,41468,2
41469,The color is not as it appears online.,41469,2
41469,It looks so much prettier online but in person its such a light pink.,41469,2
41470,The product was great.,41470,2
41470,But 3/4 of my order I'm still waiting for.,41470,2
41470,It's been a long time,41470,2
41471,"Poorly made, very small and it was not quite as pictured",41471,2
41472,It was to have remove able push up pads it had none,41472,2
41473,"Loved the look of the shirt and the quality, but they sent me not only the wrong size but the wrong color as well and when I tried to order it again correctly they were out of stock.",41473,2
41474,No room for the boys as others have stated.,41474,2
41475,"The dress itself is fine, but the colors bled into the white during shipping I guess?",41475,2
41475,When I took it out of the package it was all gray and blotchy on the sleeves.,41475,2
41475,"I may see if I can dye the whole thing a solid color so I can wear it, but as of right now, that is not possible.",41475,2
41476,I really wanted to wear this for a vacation but it's too small.,41476,2
41476,I went by the size chart but it didn't work out.,41476,2
41476,Had to return it.,41476,2
41477,This would be perfect for a 6 years old child.,41477,2
41477,Too small but also to short to fit anybody over 4'5.,41477,2
41478,Not gold toned at all.,41478,2
41478,"The ""diamonds"" are too prominent.",41478,2
41478,Reminds me of my great grandmother's costume jewelry.,41478,2
41479,It's so nice wearing whatever you want and not having to worry about a nip slip.,41479,2
41479,I never wear a bra unless I'm working out and it's really nice to have these it's like they're not on.,41479,2
41479,However getting them off for s shower SUCKS.,41479,2
41479,"Everytime I remove them it hurts and the last time it actually ripped some of my skin off, it was soo sensitive and now I'm scared to use them..",41479,2
41479,I'm slow and gentle to remove them off too I'm not trying to stretch my skin but its super sticky so I think I'll reserve these for special occasions only.,41479,2
41479,It actually left a mark/scar.,41479,2
41480,"very cute, but too small returning at my own expense.",41480,2
41481,Very light weight and fits big.,41481,2
41481,I ordered a large and it fits more like and extra large.,41481,2
41482,More like a child's large then an adults!,41482,2
41483,Wayyyyyy too small!!!,41483,2
41483,"I'm 5'9"" and they barely reached my ankle after purchase.",41483,2
41483,"Once I washed them, they fit like old pajama pants.",41483,2
41483,"If you're short, these will be great!",41483,2
41483,"They're comfortable, stretchy and they look good.",41483,2
41483,"If you're taller than 5'7"", they will probably be a no-go.",41483,2
41484,Very small.,41484,2
41484,Measurements do not add up to the size chart.,41484,2
41484,Disappointed but can still use it for the occasion.,41484,2
41485,"Very see thru dress, you need a slip with it.",41485,2
41485,Also I like my dresses to be tighter at the waist to accentuate my curves but it's to big.,41485,2
41485,"The hem line is a little short, I don't think you can bend over in this dress.",41485,2
41485,I do wear it to work but only with a blazer and black tights.,41485,2
41485,I'm 5'6'' and 140 pounds,41485,2
41486,Cheap!!,41486,2
41486,I could not get the strings to turn the right way.,41486,2
41486,"I am an average size girl with 35"" chest and the bust area was just small and awkward.",41486,2
41487,Not what I was expecting.,41487,2
41487,"And a 2XX is very small, like a 14 probably.",41487,2
41488,Sent it back,41488,2
41489,"5ft 4"" 150 lbs.",41489,2
41489,"To tight , bought a large ( i usually wear medium - large)  its very tight and shorter than id wear out .",41489,2
41489,"Fabric is also itchy and feels cheap, definitely couldn't wear it without wanting to take it off immediately.",41489,2
41489,Returning this asap.,41489,2
41490,these are too thin.,41490,2
41491,Incredible cheap construction.,41491,2
41491,Zippers feel like they will break every time you use them.,41491,2
41491,One of the paks already has a ripped seam (after one trip).,41491,2
41492,the cups are very large but the suit is very small ?,41492,2
41492,!?!?!?!,41492,2
41492,?,41492,2
41493,Cute suit.. Not long enough and therefore didn't fit well.,41493,2
41494,Not true to size.,41494,2
41494,I got a 3X and it still was snug like a medium.,41494,2
41495,Not what I expected.,41495,2
41495,Very thin and cheap looking.,41495,2
41496,The tiniest ear cuff I've ever bought.,41496,2
41496,"If you're looking for a petite ear cuff, this would be a good choice.",41496,2
41497,"Way too small, I usually MIdium and I order this large and still was too small for me .... Dislike ....",41497,2
41498,runs way too small...fits like a junior size.,41498,2
41498,the print didn't look as pictured but the fabric was not bad though,41498,2
41499,"The sheer is perfect, but the under dress is very short and fitted.",41499,2
41499,The dress underneath is also cheap fabric leaving lint on any fabric it's rubbed on.,41499,2
41499,I definitely could not bend over in this dress since it's see through the dress underneath is too short.,41499,2
41500,It's pretty but it is very small and not true to size,41500,2
41501,"These are cute, however the actual quality is so poor!",41501,2
41501,The gemstones are loose in all three and look like they are going to fall out.,41501,2
41501,Plus the actual quality and look of the gems is also a little poor.,41501,2
41501,I was really looking forward to these and I am very disappointed.,41501,2
41501,I may return them.,41501,2
41502,Loved this wallet before it failed- but it is not built to last!,41502,2
41502,"The wallet encouraged me to slim down the number of cards I carry, cut down on cash, and just not have to deal with a George Costanza wallet anymore.",41502,2
41502,"However, it cannot stand up to the wear and tear of daily use.",41502,2
41502,"The elastic band on my wallet is shot and the wallet no longer holds cards inside- in less than a year.. Crabby's wallet is a great idea, but other companies probably execute much better.",41502,2
41503,"I am very disappointed , the buckle is not silver ...sort of a discoloerd dingy brass ,,,although not brass either .",41503,2
41504,Let's break this down bit by bit.,41504,2
41504,You get what you pay for.,41504,2
41504,"It's cotton, which is cheaper than synthetics or wool, bit you loose certain features such as warmth if you get wet (from snow, rain, or sweat).",41504,2
41504,It fit is VERY small.,41504,2
41504,"You want thermals to fit close, but not this close.",41504,2
41504,It'll probably be unwearable once it is washed.,41504,2
41504,Also the slaves are really short.,41504,2
41504,I wear between a 33 and a 34 inch on my dress shirts & the arms on the large size hit about where I would wear a watch.,41504,2
41504,Meh.,41504,2
41504,"I generally prefer a longer sleave, but it keeps them out of sight.",41504,2
41504,The length of the shirt is nice though.,41504,2
41504,I prefer a two piece thermal & this hasn't come untucked on me yet.,41504,2
41504,The material is very thin.,41504,2
41504,"Again, not a bad thing if the material & weave make up for it.",41504,2
41504,But this fails to trap air & keep it warm against your body.,41504,2
41504,"Perhaps if you order a size or two larger, it'll do a little better, but because it runs so small, the material is stretched tight.",41504,2
41504,"Conclusion - if you want a little something extra in cool (not cold) temps, this is ok for the price.",41504,2
41504,But my suggestion is to save your money & invest in a much higher quality set of thermals.,41504,2
41505,The material is nice and soft.,41505,2
41505,The stitching is of good quality.,41505,2
41505,The fit is odd not an attractive look If you are short and busty.,41505,2
41505,The shirt was damaged with red marker all over the front.,41505,2
41505,I contacted the company and they were pretty rude and provided poor customer service.,41505,2
41505,"I would not recommend this company or this product and i give this item 2 stars based off of poor customer service, strange fit and the damage to this item.",41505,2
41505,This item receives 2 stars instead of 1 star because the material is really soft and the stitching is good quality.,41505,2
41505,Unfortunately the company missed the mark here (no pun intended).,41505,2
41506,"I hate this that shirts runs very small -  granted there is a warning on the listing, however...",41506,2
41506,I ordered 2 sizes up - just to be on the SAFE side.,41506,2
41506,what a JOKE..  a women's  XXL -  will fit my 12 year old son.,41506,2
41506,"Just be aware, when they says - slim fit - runs small.",41506,2
41506,it runs EXTREMELY small.,41506,2
41506,"It has a great feminine neckline.. and nicer than most ""unisex"" athletic style raglan shirts.",41506,2
41506,"guess they need to make XXXXXL that truly equals a XL, hahaha.",41506,2
41507,The first time I put it on me all the cars fell of and then it broke.,41507,2
41507,I tried the fix it but it keeps on falling of and it's really small.,41507,2
41508,very large and not well made.,41508,2
41508,it took forever to get to my house and then you have to pay for shipping to send it back.,41508,2
41508,It does not look as good as it does in the picture,41508,2
41509,This item is sized extremely small .,41509,2
41509,"Poor quality , unfortunately I ordered 2 of them and returning them would take a lot of effort .",41509,2
41509,I would say the XXL would fit a size 4 maybe 6.,41509,2
41510,"If you want a cheap pair of glasses that you don't have to worry about banging up, these are NOT the right choice.",41510,2
41510,"I really liked the style when these arrived, and in fact that is the only reason I am giving it an extra star.",41510,2
41510,"I terms of quality, yes, I know they are $10 glasses; nonetheless I did expect them to last more than 1 day.",41510,2
41510,The very first day (actually within a few hours) the plastic above the lenses broke.,41510,2
41510,"I did not drop them or throw them or anything like that, and I was really quite surprised when I removed them and saw they had broke.",41510,2
41510,"Based on my experience, you would
a) break these so often that you may as well just buy a more expensive quality pair that will last, or
b) you would have to be so careful and take such good care while wearing these that you may as well just have nicer expensive ones
Either outcome defeating the purpose of having these for a 'cheap' pair of glasses when you don't want to ruin your expensive pair.",41510,2
41510,"I also have a different style of glasses from ZeroUV at the same price point, and they took all the abuse of vacation after I broke these without breaking a sweat.",41510,2
41511,Kind of a cheap screenprint.,41511,2
41511,"Looks like it is 3D on the picture, but it is really a crappy printing on a pleather case that already has worn out.",41511,2
41511,Not loving it at all.,41511,2
41511,Wish I would have thought it through.,41511,2
41512,I liked them when they arrived.,41512,2
41512,"Soft and cuddly, but they unraveled with a large hole in just a few days.",41512,2
41512,I had to throw them away.,41512,2
41513,"These glasses don't look like the ones in the picture, be warned.",41513,2
41514,It's too short.,41514,2
41515,This item runs really small because of the  material it is made of.,41515,2
41516,Returning due to tarnish,41516,2
41517,"too big for my face, dangles on my lip.",41517,2
41517,The clicker is really difficult to open.,41517,2
41517,I had to use bolt cutters to take it out.,41517,2
41518,The shirt is cut weirdly (i.e.,41518,2
41518,the shoulders would fall but the bust was tight); returned it.,41518,2
41519,The dress is a cheaper quality than the picture which is expected.,41519,2
41519,I like it but the size is crazy.,41519,2
41519,I purchased the US L because other people who purchased this dress stated it runs small.,41519,2
41519,The top of the dress was huge and I was unable to wear it.,41519,2
41519,The dress has a under skirt because the dress is transparent.,41519,2
41519,The under skirt was too short on me and took away the elegance of the dress.,41519,2
41520,Not satisfied with the size,41520,2
41521,"For a XXXXL, it was waaaaaay too small.",41521,2
41521,The arms were too tight and going across the back was too tight.,41521,2
41522,The front of the outfit hangs to low.,41522,2
41522,I have to wear it backwards to prevent my breasts from falling out.,41522,2
41522,Plus I thought there would be a little more cotton so a little more air would get through.,41522,2
41523,"The material is very, very thin.",41523,2
41524,This item look just like the pic but does not fit right and along the front was full of little small whole been trash it .,41524,2
41524,look sexy on but was very uncomfortable to wear,41524,2
41525,"Really, really runs small.",41525,2
41526,Does not fit like a beanie fits like your average winter hat.,41526,2
41527,"Super cute, but not for tall girls, it's toooooo short, Im 140 pds, 5'7"" and a 36 C.",41527,2
41528,"I wanted to love this shirt, but unfortunately it was very small.",41528,2
41529,cant wear it at all,41529,2
41530,I have purchased many purses from scarleton.,41530,2
41530,This is my least favorite.,41530,2
41530,It is smaller than expected and the fabric is very cheep feeling.,41530,2
41531,I'm big breasted DD and I got an xxlg and around my waist it fits good but only covers half my boobs and it's very cheaply made.,41531,2
41531,Would not buy it again.,41531,2
41532,"Cut out and sleeves were too much for me, could work on someone else.",41532,2
41533,"I bought this for my work desk, but my glasses were too heavy and it kept tipping over.",41533,2
41533,I gave it to my nephew to hold his glasses.,41533,2
41533,It's cute though,41533,2
41534,"Nope, I didn't find it as a good bargain.",41534,2
41534,Quality wasn't as expected and it was too big.,41534,2
41534,But the service was good and the item was delivered quickly.,41534,2
41535,"I'm 5'3"" and roughly 135/140 lbs, but thighs are the largest part of me - these socks refuse to stay up on my thigh ; the top ALWAYS rolls down",41535,2
41536,I'm 5'1 120 lbs and the sleeves were short.,41536,2
41536,& the material was weird not soft like I expected it was like costume material.,41536,2
41537,The size it's like a 28-30,41537,2
41538,The screen print was poor.,41538,2
41538,Looks cheap.,41538,2
41539,"I""ve had this ring for a few years now.",41539,2
41539,At first it was really great!,41539,2
41539,gorgeous and the silver really held up!,41539,2
41539,But after a few months the silver started rubbing off and creating this sort of permanent tarnish.,41539,2
41539,"I never washed my hands with it or did any sort of manual labor that would cause it to discolor, but there it is.",41539,2
41539,So now it sits in my jewelry box because I don't like wearing rings that look like costume jewelry gone bad.,41539,2
41540,got a size 16 and it doesn't fit :( I am a large/xl in shirts u.s. thought it would be big enough.,41540,2
41540,"cute top, just super tiny.",41540,2
41541,Its was too big and poorly made,41541,2
41542,The swim suit was the only thing I had a problem with an that's ok sending it back on,41542,2
41543,Not as nice as it looks.,41543,2
41543,Very thin material and not a quality made tunic,41543,2
41544,Was much bigger than we thought the picture showed.,41544,2
41544,It's cute but way too big!,41544,2
41544,!,41544,2
41545,"If you are tall, do not buy this.",41545,2
41545,"Also if you have a butt, it probably won't fit.",41545,2
41545,"It was really cute but after getting it over my butt, the top only went half way up my torso and had no chance of covering my chest.",41545,2
41545,"I'm 5'9"" and ordered a medium.",41545,2
41545,I won't be buying 1 pieces online again after this...,41545,2
41546,I was quite disappointed with this product.,41546,2
41546,I have big boobs and a big butt lol so i ordered a large.,41546,2
41546,"I got it today and the strap was ripped, the material is poor quality, and it fit like an extra small.",41546,2
41546,The crochet in the middle was nice though!,41546,2
41546,If you are well developed i wouldn't order this.,41546,2
41547,So beyond upset !,41547,2
41547,The anchor is well I don't know what it is ...,41547,2
41547,I will turn it round for the pictures .,41547,2
41548,Gold shiny scales is not accurate.,41548,2
41548,Design is blurry and scales are a mix of dark purplish color and orange.,41548,2
41548,Guess they thought that makes gold :(  super bummed.,41548,2
41548,Also a tad loose in the knees for a size 2 gal.,41548,2
41549,I would want you to send another one free of charge that actually fits longer.,41549,2
41550,I like the look of the hat.,41550,2
41550,The chin strap/cord was perfect for keeping the hat from blowing away.,41550,2
41550,While it fit as expected I was not impressed with the quality as it broke very easily.,41550,2
41550,I was not impressed with the sturdiness (or lack thereof) and so I would not buy again.,41550,2
41550,**This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail price.,41550,2
41550,I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers.,41550,2
41550,I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.,41550,2
41551,it is completely see through.,41551,2
41551,i cant wear it at all.,41551,2
41552,smaller than i thought,41552,2
41553,I ordered a 2xl and it fit like a xl on me.,41553,2
41553,other then that i liked it.,41553,2
41554,so ordered a medium.,41554,2
41554,The top fit like a small.,41554,2
41554,The bottoms did not fit at all...,41554,2
41554,Looked like kids sizes.,41554,2
41554,Don't reccomend.,41554,2
41555,"A ""Chinese"" Large and I am not Chinese so yeah.",41555,2
41555,My husband said I looked like a street walker.,41555,2
41555,"Camel toe, not my look.",41555,2
41556,Youth size drop seat is for decoration only.,41556,2
41556,There was no mention of that in the description.,41556,2
41557,fell apart,41557,2
41558,Not a comfortable material.,41558,2
41558,"Far too big around the waist, too short from top to bottom so the wedgie it creates is TERRIBLE.",41558,2
41558,But it could be worse,41558,2
41559,Didn't fit normal on anyone in my house.,41559,2
41559,We are all different sizes and a large barely fit on my roommate who wears a small.,41559,2
41559,It didn't fit right in the arms at all.,41559,2
41559,Very tight.,41559,2
41559,Cute just poor design.,41559,2
41559,And sizing,41559,2
41560,You have to tie yourself; 3/6 are Christmas print,41560,2
41561,I order this thinking the large would be perfect but this dress was way too big.,41561,2
41561,It is very long and the sleeves were huge.,41561,2
41561,It looked like I was wearing a bag.,41561,2
41562,Hard to put on Even when i ordered a bigger size.,41562,2
41562,Doesn't really flatten stomach.,41562,2
41562,The lace rolls all the way up.,41562,2
41562,Not happy to be honest.,41562,2
41562,I'm not even to big to have such problems.,41562,2
41562,However it does somewhat lift the butt up.,41562,2
41563,Way too small,41563,2
41564,I really hated the materials is was made from.,41564,2
41564,very thing craft foam and cheap paint.,41564,2
41564,I would only get this if I was planning on going to a Halloween drinking party and planned on it getting destroyed.,41564,2
41564,Though it fits fine and isn't really uncomfortable.,41564,2
41565,Fabric has a red tint to it and is very stiff.,41565,2
41566,The quality of these has gone way downhill.,41566,2
41566,One wear and they were fraying around the waistband.,41566,2
41567,I bought my daughter and son these iplay hats and was not impressed.,41567,2
41567,"They are flimsy and don't hold their form, especially if they get wet.",41567,2
41567,They also bled onto other clothing when I put them in the swim bag wet.,41567,2
41568,"It run small and if that wasn't the case,  I still wouldn't like it.",41568,2
41568,The fabric is funky.,41568,2
41568,It's cut way too low (doesn't look like the picture) and the patch pocket is practically in the armpit.,41568,2
41569,Don't waste your money--this shirt dyed my skin gray (the color I purchased) and wouldn't wash off for days.,41569,2
41570,the dye comes off on your hands and the bag smells bad.....:(,41570,2
41571,to long a bit gay,41571,2
41572,Way to small...misleading its a blouse very disappointed,41572,2
41573,No support for bust whatsoever.,41573,2
41573,The straps are way too long and cannot be adjusted.,41573,2
41574,Not as advertized.,41574,2
41574,I ordered purple leggings and got something that was closer to eggplant to black.,41574,2
41575,"First of all, the shipping speed was great.",41575,2
41575,"Secondly, the clicker bar didn't click when I got it.",41575,2
41575,"I tried and tried to have it click into place and stay there, but the darn thing wouldn't stick - it kept popping back out.",41575,2
41575,"Being the resourceful person I am, I tried to fix it with pliers which worked, but took off some of the faux silver plating.",41575,2
41575,"When I finally put it in my septum, I realized that the look is just not for me.",41575,2
41575,"Not only is it larger than my regular horseshoe ring, it also dangles and barely brushes the top of my upper lip, which is not a good feeling.",41575,2
41575,"I'd recommend it to other people to try, but I don't know anyone else with a septum piercing...",41575,2
41576,"Very small, barely can see the lil girl",41576,2
41577,I returned this.,41577,2
41577,The gold hard ware was very cheap and flimsy for this price point.,41577,2
41577,Not a snug closure and those gold caps on the closure.are quite flashy (not in a good way).,41577,2
41578,"This is really pretty, and for as cheap as it is, I wasn't really expecting a lot.",41578,2
41578,But I bought the dress along with a matching scarf from another seller.,41578,2
41578,"And no matter how tight you tie a scarf around this thing to hold it up, the sleeve straps are so long that it falls off of you, once you begin walking.",41578,2
41578,"I was really lucky that I'd worn a shirt under it, and not just a bra, because every time I took three steps, the entire top fell down around my elbows again.",41578,2
41578,"It made walking anywhere (and doing anything), very hard, because I had to keep re-adjusting my dress straps every few seconds.",41578,2
41578,"I'm hoping that maybe if I shorten the arms a lot, I can wear the thing.",41578,2
41579,Runs really small,41579,2
41580,I usually get 3x because I like things big but this was just to small can't even wear it.,41580,2
41581,Runs about 3 sizes small.,41581,2
41582,Too small.,41582,2
41582,Just a band of cloth.,41582,2
41582,Not a skirt at all.,41582,2
41583,I like using this bags.,41583,2
41583,Thank you,41583,2
41584,"Too small
Not made well",41584,2
41585,Looks better in pictures.,41585,2
41586,I liked the top but very thin material and did not cover my boobs what's so ever if you have small boobs it be good but I have ds and was so see threw and didn't cover them!,41586,2
41586,Skirt was soo small and so tights and wierd fabric no bueno sorry over didn't like it,41586,2
41587,"The product is the exact type of material I am looking for, BUT the crotch and rear are so tight that there isn't much room to move.",41587,2
41587,"I feel ""smashed"".",41587,2
41587,I think the sizing chart should be adjusted.,41587,2
41587,"I have a 30"" waist and bought small, but after trying one on, I think that I will have to go up 2 sizes.",41587,2
41588,too small.,41588,2
41588,Was for a VERY SMALL person,41588,2
41589,"Didn't like the texture of the fabric, kind of a nylon feel to it.",41589,2
41589,It wasn't good in the hot weather.,41589,2
41590,Loved the way it looked at the Amazon site but when it arrived I was very disappointed.,41590,2
41590,I guess I should have expected it to be cheaply made because it was so inexpensive.,41590,2
41590,I purchased it as a gift for a St Patrick's birthday but returned it as it really was cheap looking.,41590,2
41591,Need a bigger size an they're to stiff in the back of the shoe,41591,2
41592,"This top is not loose and does not have baggy sleeves and is quite a short shirt and I am only 5'5"".",41592,2
41593,Too big for a fake nose ring.... that was the only reason I wanted it,41593,2
41594,The posts of my earrings will not penetrate them.,41594,2
41595,super cheap.,41595,2
41595,the chain is completely kinked.,41595,2
41595,"will probably cut off the chain, and just attach the earring to the pendant.",41595,2
41595,would advise against spending more than 5$ on these.,41595,2
41596,This is not what I expected.,41596,2
41596,I can use them in my shop for welding and grinding metal.,41596,2
41596,They seem too small for an adult.,41596,2
41597,Okay but not such good quality.,41597,2
41598,"hard to put on and fits like a T shirt I bought the size based on the chart, in fact I bought one size Smaller than what my body size really is so I was very upset when it arrived and it is so lose it serves no use.",41598,2
41599,"Pretty but the material is cheap, don't look like the photo",41599,2
41600,"I purchased a suit one size larger than I normally wear, but it was still like pouring myself into it.",41600,2
41600,And it was way too short lengthwise...perhaps made more for shorter women.,41600,2
41600,"I am 5'9"".",41600,2
41600,"However, I passed it on to my sister who is about five inches shorter and smaller than I am.",41600,2
41600,"It did seem to have quality material and good stitching, so I'm sorry I couldn't wear it.",41600,2
41601,zipper broke in 2 weeks,41601,2
41602,No ass to lift?,41602,2
41603,It's a cute bathing suit.,41603,2
41603,"Fits well and looks good on, just don't plan on wearing it near water (ironic, right?).",41603,2
41603,I went to the beach (live across the street) and went in the water up to my knees for about 5 minutes.,41603,2
41603,"The bottoms didn't get soaked, but I did get splashed a bit by some waves.",41603,2
41603,I came home and found the copper color already wore off in some spots and turned black!,41603,2
41603,Super annoying because now I can't even wear it for the event I specifically bought it for!,41603,2
41603,"Keep in mind I wore the bathing suit for a total of an hour, if that.",41603,2
41603,I'm being generous giving it two stars simply because the top is still functional and I'm able to wear it with different bottoms.,41603,2
41603,"Overall, very disappointed.",41603,2
41604,I am a petite sized 8-10 there was way too much fabric in general with a strange flap up in the middle of the breasts..,41604,2
41605,it was so thin mateial,41605,2
41606,The backs are so small that I lost one earring,41606,2
41607,"Lovely necklace - color, size, style.",41607,2
41607,Problem is that it came broken and I did manage to find some of the pieces and glued them in but not all.,41607,2
41607,Couldn't be bothered to return it.,41607,2
41608,"I bought the blue and black bows as well, unfortunately unlike the other two, the white bow's band was very stretched out already and doesn't fit as well as I would like it to for some of my dresses.",41608,2
41609,Nothing like picture.,41609,2
41609,Don't waste your money.,41609,2
41609,Just because they are inexpensive doesn't always make it a good purchase.,41609,2
41609,I am a M.  Bought a L because I knew it was going to be cheap.,41609,2
41609,Even a L is too small.,41609,2
41609,Possible wear as a shirt.,41609,2
41610,"The hat fits irregularly because of the logo maybe, not sure, but it looks cute - just not on your head lol",41610,2
41611,Too small.,41611,2
41611,Ordered size 6 but will get another one and give the one i got to my sister.,41611,2
41612,"while they fit, they are definitely tights not leggings.",41612,2
41612,You cannot wear them without covering your assests unless you want for people to see everything.,41612,2
41612,They also have a chemical odor to them.,41612,2
41613,Stretched out in a month and now is too loose.,41613,2
41614,The suit is still too big.,41614,2
41614,I didn't realize that US size and European sizes are different.,41614,2
41614,This do not work for me.,41614,2
41614,I tried twice.,41614,2
41615,"Way too small, wasn't worth it at all.",41615,2
41615,Very disappointed,41615,2
41616,Strings are already coming undone where you cannot tighten on wrist.,41616,2
41616,I haven't even worn it yet!,41616,2
41617,Product did not come with a black box or a white bag.,41617,2
41617,Not as pictured.,41617,2
41617,Glasses seem okay though.,41617,2
41618,Arms were quarter length sleeves and the buttons started way to high.,41618,2
41618,This is a knock off of the pick you're shown very cheap and the material is the type that would fade and ball easily,41618,2
41619,Really see through.,41619,2
41619,Tight through the calves.,41619,2
41619,Runs really small,41619,2
41620,Item was not as described and too small.,41620,2
41620,I am returning for a refund.,41620,2
41621,"File this in the category of ""you get what you pay for.""",41621,2
41621,"Based upon just enough negative reviews about the quality of the more popular (and higher priced) competition for this belt - SlideBelts, I wasn't willing to drop double the price on something I couldn't hold in my hands first.",41621,2
41621,"I figured they were selling the same caliber materials as SlideBelts for half the price, and I still suspect that they are.",41621,2
41621,"But now I know those materials are cheap, and I printed the return label before writing this review.",41621,2
41621,"The leather is a bonded product, covered in polyurethane.",41621,2
41621,It looks and feels cheap because it is.,41621,2
41621,Any review that suggests otherwise does not have a realistic frame of reference for what a quality leather belt is.,41621,2
41621,"To be clear, this is actually a $25 belt, not a great deal on a $50 belt.",41621,2
41621,The buckle (black lattice pattern) appeared from the photo to be a textured metal finish.,41621,2
41621,It is nothing of the sort.,41621,2
41621,"It appears to be a printed design, covered with a glossy piece of plastic that picks up smudges and fingerprints, and looks terrible with any light hitting it.",41621,2
41621,"The ratchet mechanism, FWIW, appears to function as intended, but I never actually put the belt on.",41621,2
41621,"The last thing - and this is my fault for not being careful - is that I thought 1.125"" (the width of this belt) was the standard fashion, but it definitely is not.",41621,2
41621,"It immediately looked like a skinny belt out of the box, and every other belt in my closet is 1.25"" wide.",41621,2
41621,Learned something new.,41621,2
41622,Could be cheaper and do not feel the aloe like other infused socks!,41622,2
41623,too small,41623,2
41624,ring is tinted black not silver,41624,2
41625,"Smaller than expected, everything is is good.",41625,2
41626,This was a disappointment.,41626,2
41626,"It is huge around the waist, and the sleeves were way too short.",41626,2
41626,"I'm generally wear a solid 16, and the dimensions of this shirt are very odd.",41626,2
41626,"Also it wrinkles a lot, even fresh out of the dryer.",41626,2
41626,"I will wear it under other things for warmth, but I certainly wouldn't wear it by itself.",41626,2
41627,"Its to tight, but a pretty dress",41627,2
41628,Way to small but o well,41628,2
41629,I normally wear a 10 to 12 depending on the brand.,41629,2
41629,I bought a 15 because it's a juniors size.,41629,2
41629,These were huge!,41629,2
41629,I returned them.,41629,2
41629,"Even if they fit, I don't think I would have kept them.",41629,2
41629,The distressed look was strange.,41629,2
41629,"It was more of a shred than distress, if that makes any sense.",41629,2
41630,Beware!,41630,2
41630,The sleeves and shoulder on this dress are very tight.,41630,2
41630,"I'm pretty small too and usually wear an extra small, but ordered a small hoping it would fit.",41630,2
41630,Very cute dress!,41630,2
41630,So disappointed though because I can't wear it and don't know anyone that can.,41630,2
41631,"Got it in the mail today, it is extremely stiff and scratchy, including the handles.",41631,2
41631,"The stitching on the inside on the pockets was not done well, it shouldn't take long before it comes undone which was kind of expected due to the price but the extreme stiffness and the scratchiness was too much  to give as a gift which makes me sad as It was the cutest thing I have ever seen for a bag.",41631,2
41632,They top part was as expected from the picture but the tutu bottom was BRIGHT NEON ORANGE.,41632,2
41632,What the heck.,41632,2
41633,Way smaller then a thought!,41633,2
41633,Made for a female not a male.,41633,2
41634,Poor quality,41634,2
41635,"Nice dress, very short",41635,2
41636,"Sleeve/arm ""holes"" are too small, causes arm-pit chaffing.",41636,2
41636,Higher on the waist than expected and chest area is very compressed.,41636,2
41636,"I'm 6' 2"", 190 @ 11% bf.",41636,2
41637,Very cute top but the sizing is more than 1 to 2 sizes off.,41637,2
41637,I ordered an xl due to wearing a large and when I received the shirt and tried it on.....it was way too tight ran as a small basically.,41637,2
41637,Not big enough for me and had to give away.,41637,2
41637,Disappointed.,41637,2
41637,Showed up faster than expected but the sizing chart is not accurate at all for anyone in the US.,41637,2
41638,"I like it, but is to small",41638,2
41639,The product came quickly but the color was so dull it barely looked the colors advertised.,41639,2
41639,It is versatile though but just be cautioned that the color may not be the same.,41639,2
41640,The arm holes are so constricting that I can't wear it.,41640,2
41641,The shirt design and size were great.,41641,2
41641,When it arrived we found the sleeve was not sewn on correctly so there was a large hole where the sleeve met the shirt.,41641,2
41642,overpriced,41642,2
41643,"There's nothing oversized about this, it's very small.",41643,2
41643,"I mean it's a high quality bag but it's just super small, I would use it as a backpack for school but I gaduated so, eh.",41643,2
41643,"This isn't ideal for traveling, at best it's an overnight bag.",41643,2
41644,Mask is for a child,41644,2
41645,I brought a large and I usually buys a medium but it was still too small.,41645,2
41646,It looks big and fuzzy but it's thin and not fuzzy sigh,41646,2
41647,"whoever design this blouse, had a good intention, but did not executed well, it looks awful  from the front, its like you are wearing a blouse backward, and I tried to put turn it around, may be wear a halter top under, that did not work out, because of the arm hole.",41647,2
41647,The color is gorgeous !,41647,2
41648,i can't believe I was drunk enough to order this,41648,2
41649,Let me start with the positive feedback.,41649,2
41649,"The designs are very interesting and I like the style, also I like the fact that most of the items are made of cotton.",41649,2
41649,The delivery was quick and earlier than expected.,41649,2
41649,"Cons are the product doesn't really look like in the picture, a poncho inspired little piece is small and shows pieces of skin when moving.",41649,2
41649,The cotton is very thin and see trough (in off white color).,41649,2
41649,Would not order again.,41649,2
41650,It's huge,41650,2
41651,"The idea is awesome, but it was so obviously cut out and ironed on,  it was aweful .",41651,2
41651,There are enter screen printing options better than make your own iron onsie.,41651,2
41651,"For what was charged for the onsie, I could have printed the image on my own iron on paper myself, and saved the $ on it, and shipping.",41651,2
41652,The color is true but the shirt itself is small and short I'm a woman 56 in stature and a 38 double d I ordered the extra large which would usually fit me but this particular one didn't I guess someone's getting it as a Christmas gift this year,41652,2
41653,These are ok.,41653,2
41653,The color fades after just a few washes and the threading is pretty terrible.,41653,2
41653,I'm constantly trimming frays.,41653,2
41654,Way smaller than size stated,41654,2
41655,This item runs very small ...... Like 1-2 sizes too small.........,41655,2
41656,TOO SMALL FOR MOST NIPPLES.,41656,2
41656,"They are cute (though they look like milk droplets...) and I got them in, but one of them had a bead that kept popping off and finally one day when I took off my shirt the bead was gone and they are microscopic so I couldn't find it and of course I now don't have a pair.",41656,2
41656,Waste of money.,41656,2
41657,I am pleased with how fast they got shipped and out to me.,41657,2
41657,But pretty disappointed in the fact that they do not look like the picture.,41657,2
41657,They are very dark purple/blackish.,41657,2
41657,Not what I was hoping for at all.,41657,2
41658,They are way smaller then tag says.,41658,2
41658,Tag said 6xl but closer to a 3xl.,41658,2
41659,Sleeves are different lengths,41659,2
41660,to small,41660,2
41661,I usually wear a size 12 shirt.,41661,2
41661,I ordered a size 14 and it is too small!,41661,2
41661,Very disappointed.,41661,2
41662,Not made for average sized American women,41662,2
41663,Short at the bottom a little large at the top  but I like the feel of it,41663,2
41664,OK. Big enough for all papers but 4 wheels would be better.,41664,2
41664,Doesn't stay upright,41664,2
41665,"These sunglasses are flexible in the arms that come off the temple and behind the ear - but honestly, that's not where they need to be flexible.",41665,2
41665,"They need to be flexible where the arm has a joint at the temple, and they are not.",41665,2
41665,"Both of my kids, ages 1.5 and 3.5, within hours (1.5 year old) and days (3.5 year old) of having these sunglasses, unfolded them and bent them past the straight out point and completely warped the plastic joint making the sunglasses pretty worthless.",41665,2
41665,"They won't sit flat, it can't be bent back, and on one pair the arm broke off completely at the weld point of the plastic.",41665,2
41665,"Sadly, not indestructible as many reviews claim.",41665,2
41665,"For the price, I was hoping for something better.",41665,2
41665,"We are going to stick with $5 sunglasses from Target, knowing that they won't last an entire summer but not feeling guilty if we have to purchase a second pair.",41665,2
41666,"This dress was very sheer, which I was not expecting, so I have returned it for a refund.",41666,2
41667,I ordered these because they were supposed to be small.,41667,2
41667,They are just as large if not larger than all the sunglasses I own.,41667,2
41668,I'm regularly a medium on top and small on bottom for bikinis.,41668,2
41668,I ordered both a M and a L because of reviews that said you should order up a size.,41668,2
41668,I'm a 36C and the L top was too big.,41668,2
41668,The medium top fit ok but I would prefer it to be more snug.,41668,2
41668,The medium bottoms fit perfectly.,41668,2
41668,I will probably order a S so I can wear a S top and M bottoms.,41668,2
41669,Not able to ware it,41669,2
41670,"WAY TO SMALL, ordered an XL and it's really comparable to a medium size here -  However I do like the style!",41670,2
41670,"Seems like everything that comes from China is smaller (saving $ on material, I guess).",41670,2
41670,Also took over a month to receive.,41670,2
41670,It's too much of a hassle to return so will give to one of my tiny friends.,41670,2
41670,Wish CHINA would be clearly marked before ordering so I could avoid.,41670,2
41671,terrible fabric and it smells funny.,41671,2
41671,i do not recommend this.,41671,2
41671,VERY cheap.,41671,2
41672,Beautiful swim suit but cheap material.,41672,2
41672,It seems like you can see through it sometimes and the top piece is too small.,41672,2
41673,not what I thought it would be not wearable,41673,2
41674,"I ordered extra large, when I opened my package, the leggings looked like they were extra small.",41674,2
41674,Ridiculously small.,41674,2
41675,These are not truly long neck covers.,41675,2
41675,More like 3/4 length.,41675,2
41676,"Received on the day she had to wear it and it was to large and too short, length worked but had to pin down both sides to get it to fit.",41676,2
41676,"Other then poor fit, very pretty dress",41676,2
41677,I did not know that it was so thin and see through,41677,2
41678,"Way bigger than what was expected, and it looks cheap",41678,2
41679,I made this purchase quickly because I needed a cute dress by the next day.,41679,2
41679,"Unfortunately, I should have received the pictures more thoroughly.",41679,2
41679,I didn't notice in one of the pictures the top looked more of a cream color and in the second pic it was white.,41679,2
41679,Never ended up wearing the dress because it looked so cheap.,41679,2
41679,The fits was fine but I didn't like the material.,41679,2
41679,What stood out the most was the obvious line where they sewed the back of the skirt.,41679,2
41680,These ride straight up the butt.,41680,2
41680,My son hates them.,41680,2
41681,Sizes run too small,41681,2
41682,Didn't really like it,41682,2
41683,I usually am a large size but based on reviews I ordered a size up so got the XL.,41683,2
41683,I could barely get it over my shoulders it was so tight.,41683,2
41683,If you are a size small the XL might work for you.,41683,2
41684,My package arrived in a timely manner.,41684,2
41684,However some of the thread was already coming apart when it arrived.,41684,2
41684,I measured myself and used the size chart to order but the product was too big.,41684,2
41684,It's got the one button in the front.,41684,2
41684,But behind that is just a piece of fabric sewed into the garment and it's awkward to put on.,41684,2
41684,That should have been a button also.,41684,2
41684,I'm going to have to make alterations when I have the time to make it wearable and fix the fraying threads.,41684,2
41684,Would not recommend unless you feel like fixing it yourself when it arrives.,41684,2
41685,"It fit, and has plenty of room, even at  sizeeighteen self, and came in reasonable time, but it  look as cheap as it was, the edges arnt finished and curl under and fray, and the fishnet was cut with hughe holes.",41685,2
41686,"Delivery was prompt, but directions are scant, and it simply doesn't work.",41686,2
41686,"Mine is jammed or something, and I cannot even begin to see how to fix it.",41686,2
41687,The bag was not what I EXPECTED.,41687,2
41687,Two months into the school  term the zipper was totally destroyed.,41687,2
41687,The bag is not strong and would not recommend it.,41687,2
41688,The leggings are nice but it was way too small.,41688,2
41688,What's weird is I ordered the black and it was like a medium and I ordered the blue and it fit well.,41688,2
41688,Both sizes I ordered an XL but one was a lot smaller then that,41688,2
41689,Sizing runs small.,41689,2
41690,Good product but arrived in a full black version instead of a red/black mix.,41690,2
41690,"Without the color problem, it will be a 4-5 rate.",41690,2
41691,I am alomost 6 ft tall but very thin.,41691,2
41691,This gown is huge.,41691,2
41691,I may wear it in wamer months as a house cover up but doubt it.,41691,2
41692,This is beautiful but small for my very average size head.,41692,2
41693,Not as sparkly as I expected,41693,2
41694,This product was much bigger than the picture looks to be.,41694,2
41694,"I was wanting for a purse or pocketbook, way too big.",41694,2
41695,"I LOVED the top, but the bottoms did NOT cover the butt at all.",41695,2
41695,Looked almost like a thong.,41695,2
41696,Too small.,41696,2
41696,Recommend for smaller folks or even kids.,41696,2
41696,Fits like a crop top unlike advertised image,41696,2
41697,I ended up returning.,41697,2
41697,The bottoms you could see the black stitching on the white.,41697,2
41697,"Top, I have 36D and the black straps didn't lay over my top as nicely in the picture.",41697,2
41697,But overall the quality of the material was good.,41697,2
41698,too large!!,41698,2
41698,"that or my ass and tits are too small... damn, now that's really sad.",41698,2
41699,Arrived crushed.,41699,2
41700,"Fabric was cheap, more costumey than I was hoping for.",41700,2
41700,"At 4'11"" and 95 lbs, I've never had a problem fitting into a small (even in Asian sizes), but I wasn't able to get this over my shoulders or hips.",41700,2
41701,Usually wear size L I order XXXL to be save but still not able to close it.,41701,2
41702,Too big.,41702,2
41702,"I ussually ware ""L"" but this ""L"" is a ""XL""",41702,2
41703,"While they are soft and comfy (at first), there are a couple problems.",41703,2
41703,1.,41703,2
41703,The legs ride up like crazy.,41703,2
41703,2.,41703,2
41703,"The two strips of fabric that make up the pouch, the top edges chaff the groin.",41703,2
41703,"I had heard a lot of good things about these underwear, but unfortunately I can't recommend them.",41703,2
41704,"MANY jewels fell out, and could not get them back in, tried clear super glue and they still yellowed.",41704,2
41704,"It's a gorgeous ring, shame it'd not better quality.",41704,2
41705,Very cute just way too small not true to size recommend going 1 size up,41705,2
41706,NOT GREAT,41706,2
41707,runs very narrow,41707,2
41708,thin and cheap material.,41708,2
41708,It was also too small.,41708,2
41709,Nothing I could do to make this look good ...,41709,2
41710,The cut of the dress is very flattering but is was almost transparent there was no way I could wear it in public.,41710,2
41710,I ordered the white so maybe the black would work.,41710,2
41711,"Great material but to big for the pocket, of it was a lil smaller it would be awesome.",41711,2
41712,Shorts are pretty long.,41712,2
41712,Material sucks!,41712,2
41713,This material is the same as what a leotard is made from.,41713,2
41713,I followed the reviews and ordered a size accordingly.,41713,2
41713,"The fit was loose for the type of the material, I think it was meant to be worn tighter and as an undergarment rather than a shirt.",41713,2
41713,"The style looked good though and if it was cotton, would have fit nicely.",41713,2
41713,"Because of the material, the shirt was always riding up.",41713,2
41713,The clasp broke the second time wearing it.,41713,2
41714,first wash and they look old,41714,2
41715,This item runs extremely small.,41715,2
41715,Material was not what I expected.,41715,2
41716,The zippers won't stay zipped.,41716,2
41717,I thought this swimsuit was absolutely gorgeous and decided to purchase it for my vacation.,41717,2
41717,"After receiving it, I was very disappointed with the placement of the bra padding.",41717,2
41717,This swimsuit is obviously made for someone with a long torso as the bra padding was too high for someone with a short frame.,41717,2
41717,"Thinking that it was a defect, I ordered it again and the second swimsuit was exactly the same.",41717,2
41717,I would not purchase this item unless you have a tall frame.,41717,2
41718,Quality is good but runs very small.,41718,2
41719,"I received 3 blacks 1 dark grey, 1 light grey and 1 burgundy color.",41719,2
41719,The image shown in the assorted colors were not the ones I received.,41719,2

41720,"Material is very synthetic also, almost certainly made in China.",41720,2
41721,Kinda small for a middle schooler ..,41721,2
41722,The gold makes them look like toy sunglasses.,41722,2
41723,Wow.,41723,2
41723,A very bright blue to be considered distressed looking.,41723,2
41723,An html code #333399 but it is the intense sheen of the fabric that causes it to look like leggings and definitely not jeans.,41723,2
41723,Haven't even tried them on but might be returning due to the sheen reflection off the Arizona sun that these leggings will create.,41723,2
41723,"Wearing these to a rave or under a blacklight, they would be awesome.",41723,2
41724,Super comfy.,41724,2
41724,My first pair is too small and I was about to buy more in every color the next size up but shipping is absurd.,41724,2
41724,$4.99 PER PAIR.,41724,2
41724,Not worth it.,41724,2
41725,"These fit well and look great but boy, the rough mesh is uncomfortable after wearing them a while and I took them off because I felt like I was going to get chaffed/irritated :(",41725,2
41726,"I like the hat and the image but it is way too small for me, it doesn't fit properly.",41726,2
41727,"Feels kind of cheap, leather is soft and there is a piece of cardboard and some stuffing material added that just makes it feel really cheap.",41727,2
41727,I ordered another product from a different Manufacturer.,41727,2
41727,I can not recommend this product.,41727,2
41727,Guess I 'll just throw it away...lesson learned:(,41727,2
41728,Cute but ridiculously small.,41728,2
41729,They look great but the lenses are hazy and the lack of a nose piece affects you wearing it.,41729,2
41729,I'd pass on these again.,41729,2
41730,i loved this suit but i only got to wear it once or twice and it broke.,41730,2
41731,"Honestly, I don't care for the quality of this product.",41731,2
41731,I won't be buying from this vendor anymore.,41731,2
41731,But to each their own!,41731,2
41732,"Vionic shoes are pretty much the only shoes I can wear, but this particular shoe really hurts the top of my foot where the center strap rubs, no matter how much I adjust the straps.",41732,2
41733,"While I like the size, style and color, the corners of the wallet are now a light brown because the color has worn off.",41733,2
41733,"I'm not hard on wallets, I don't even go into my purse every day, so it has had light use and is only 3 months old.",41733,2
41734,This wallet is very stylish.,41734,2
41734,"However, it tends to open involuntarily at times which is a big risk as it means the money and the cards can fall out without you having noticed it.",41734,2
41734,I really expected a lot from this product based on the reviews.,41734,2
41735,WAS LISTED A WOMEN CLEARLY A MENS WHEN ARRIVED,41735,2
41736,Good fabric but way to small and I got the  x _  large.,41736,2
41736,Usually wear a small to medium,41736,2
41737,This top is very short in front.,41737,2
41737,You will either have your tummy showing or you will need to wear high-waisted pants with it.,41737,2
41738,Hola,41738,2
41739,not what i expected,41739,2
41740,It fits good but I can tell its stretching after about 3 uses.,41740,2
41740,I can already use the second row of hooks and just about the third row.,41740,2
41741,Was very cute.,41741,2
41741,But was much smaller than what the size chart said it was,41741,2
41742,disappointed by how small it runs,41742,2
41743,"Bought this purse for its color, shape & size to last me the year of 2016.",41743,2
41743,Unfortunately 3 months in the zipper broke.,41743,2
41743,Well month 5 I thought who cares I'll use it anyways.,41743,2
41743,..this morning I noticed the zipper has actually detached itself from the purse.,41743,2
41743,"Still love the purse but either it's low quality, or just a sour one in a bunch.",41743,2
41744,Doesn't look like that in person..Very ard to make it look that way..Glad I didn't payy a lot for it.,41744,2
41745,Garment is specifically intended for costume only and IS NOT made for swimming pool.,41745,2
41745,"Bought my granddaughter one and she took it to the pool, needless to say it did not hold up.",41745,2
41745,The outside fabric wears off.,41745,2
41745,It should be posted as costume use only and not suitable for pool use.,41745,2
41746,"Very, very tiny & fragile.",41746,2
41746,Pretty little stones.,41746,2
41746,But you MUST be VERY CAREFUL putting this one on & taking it off.,41746,2
41746,I wouldn't order this as a gift.,41746,2
41746,I will use this as an extender for other necklaces at times because it's pretty on the back of one's neck!,41746,2
41747,"for the amount of time it took to actually get to me, huge upset!!",41747,2
41747,The earring itself is cute but the earring doesn't want to stay in my ear.,41747,2
41747,"For less than $3, why bother to return it?- will just give it to someone",41747,2
41748,Parka is the wrong description for this.,41748,2
41748,its basically just a sweatshirt,41748,2
41749,The strap that goes around the ankle is SUPER small.,41749,2
41749,"I do not have fat ankles by any means, but I struggled.",41749,2
41749,"The look nice, but comfort isn't something you should be expecting out of these.",41749,2
41750,It doesn't work for me I put it on from the moment I wake up which is 7 am all the way to 9pm and it does not work.,41750,2
41750,"I admit it feels like it, but I do not see a difference.",41750,2
41750,This was a complete waste of money and I would highly suggest regular wraps.,41750,2
41750,They're cheaper and works better,41750,2
41751,I will return them as.doon as I get a label,41751,2
41752,"Plastic feeling material, if you are top heavy do not get this it  will not fit",41752,2
41753,"These are VERY LONG on me (I'm 5'1"") and I had to sort of fold them under to make them look OK with flats.",41753,2
41753,"Also, they get runs in them very easily.",41753,2
41753,"After one day walking around and not doing anything particularly rough, I have multiple places where they've pulled.",41753,2
41753,"Considering the price, I would not buy these again.",41753,2
41754,Sizing stated it was for a 13 year old girl.,41754,2
41754,It was way too tight at the shoulders and arms and the girl it was intended for is tiny.,41754,2
41755,This tux is not as pictured.,41755,2
41755,"It is a dark navy blue, and a polyester material rather than the shiny look depicted.",41755,2
41755,"The vest and tie are white, not cream and the tie is not the same white.",41755,2
41755,"It also has a cheap diamond button sewn on it, but it is a wider tie that hooks in the back.",41755,2
41755,The cut is nice on the jacket.,41755,2
41755,The Tux has black plastic buttons.,41755,2
41755,It took longer to send (5 days) than they promised.,41755,2
41755,We were disappointed.,41755,2
41756,Just opened the package....This shirt is purple!!!!,41756,2
41756,See the picture of the shirt next to a (Blue)Hilfiger polo and a (BLUE) Cubs New Era Snapback.,41756,2
41756,2 start because of the perfect fit only!!!,41756,2
41756,!,41756,2
41757,very thin and cheap feeling,41757,2
41758,these leggings are of poor quality.,41758,2
41759,Smaller fit than expected,41759,2
41760,Very cute!,41760,2
41760,but the bar is way too small which is very disapointing.,41760,2
41761,I previously ordered cruise ship luggage tags and really liked them because they had a grommet in them.,41761,2
41761,These do not.,41761,2
41761,"Anyway, I found a way to make them work.",41761,2
41762,"The pattern and colors are cute, but material is so weird it's almost like plastic!",41762,2
41762,There are no tags at all have no idea how to wash it im pretty sure it will become a disposable shirt.,41762,2
41762,I'm very disappointed with the last shopping I did on Amazon.,41762,2
41762,"Everything I ordered was garbage, horrible material, cheap looking, NO TAGS AT ALL.",41762,2
41762,It has completely changed my mind about ordering on line.,41762,2
41762,I'm not wasting my money anymore.,41762,2
41763,This fit as expected however the bottom color appears blue and white in the photo and was actually black and white.,41763,2
41763,Not what I expected.,41763,2
41763,Will return.,41763,2
41764,Really tight.,41764,2
41764,Cute but size is way off,41764,2
41765,"they are comfortable, however, very fragile - wore them once and it has a run in it",41765,2
41766,Very bad quality.,41766,2
41766,Not painted very good.,41766,2
41766,Not what the example looked like.,41766,2
41766,I would have sent them back if I had not waited so long and the gift date wasn't as soon as it was.,41766,2
41767,shirt fits like s***.,41767,2
41767,"I imagine the model in the pic has it clipped back, because it is not form fitting at all.",41767,2
41767,Shirt doesn't look good.,41767,2
41767,"I got a small, but it fits like a large.",41767,2
41768,Tight but looked cute.,41768,2
41768,Unfortunately stitching came out at sides after the first wash.,41768,2
41768,Waste of money,41768,2
41769,fair,41769,2
41770,"Fits a bit large, makes me sick every time I wear it.",41770,2
41771,Had a hole in the leg.,41771,2
41772,"I ended ordering the mens ""it's dangerous to go alone "" shirt.",41772,2
41773,It is alot smaller than shown so i gave it to my 8 yr old daughter she was wearing it and it just broke the day after recieving the only reason you are getting 2 stars is cause it is cute,41773,2
41774,liked Was not what I expected.,41774,2
41774,I was hoping to find something orient inspired.,41774,2
41774,It was not.,41774,2
41774,But what can you do.,41774,2
41774,Spend more to send back.,41774,2
41775,"Mostly fit, however the bottoms are VERY low rise.",41775,2
41775,"I got a size L. I'm a medium in Victoria secret, 145, 5'5, 36d, and it fit fine.",41775,2
41775,The reason I returned it is the black and white lining is SO stiff its scratchy and uncomfortable.,41775,2
41776,"Very cute, very comfortable, HOWEVER it's VERY thin, and the biggest issue is ... it's extremely cheaply made.",41776,2
41776,Seams ripped before I even wore it ...,41776,2
41776,I sewed it - washed it - then found more ripped seams.,41776,2
41776,It's okay to wear at home but honestly you should probably save your money and spend a bit more for something else that's better.,41776,2
41777,It's a beautiful bracelet but mine broke after only wearing it a couple of times.,41777,2
41777,I think it was cheaply made,41777,2
41778,The skirt was not the color it appears in the photos.,41778,2
41778,"Instead of being mint green it's beige, and the butterflies are more vibrant blues and purples than what is shown.",41778,2
41778,"It's a lovely skirt, it just doesn't look like what's pictured.",41778,2
41778,"Most of my disappointment comes from the fact that I already own a dress in the same beige color, made of the same material, with the same butterfly pattern.",41778,2
41778,This was not apparent from the photos and now I have two of the same thing.,41778,2
41778,The size is also a bit odd.,41778,2
41778,The description said it should fit a 55 cm to 98 cm waistline; I measured my waist at 74 cm and yet the skirt squeezes my waist and gives me a bit of a muffin top.,41778,2
41778,"I don't feel like what I got was worth what they're charging for, especially considering the dress I have with the same pattern cost me about half the price as this one.",41778,2
41779,"Fell apart almost immediately, due to cheap/incorrect glue used to bond the fake heart to the fake metal.",41779,2
41780,comes in small size,41780,2
41781,Ordered the gold/black glasses ended up getting the silver/black ones instead.,41781,2
41781,One of the lenses was scratched when I took it out of the bag & clearly was made of plastic.,41781,2
41781,"The glasses are worth $3 but you spend more, not worth it.",41781,2
41781,BUT they did come in earlier than expected.,41781,2
41782,Its a poor quality and came bubbled; the face side split from the back side on second usage but it looks OK.,41782,2
41783,"My mistake in not taking into consideration the difference in siziing from country to country, especial;ly with items from the Orient.",41783,2
41784,"Shipping was over a month, granted during Christmas Holiday season.",41784,2
41784,"However, the product didn't last a week, as the knob for the time adjustment broke.",41784,2
41784,"I do love the brand, but if you choose this brand, don't go cheap.",41784,2
41785,Not for any newborn or infant head I've ever seen.,41785,2
41785,These hats fit me (an adult).,41785,2
41785,Plus you have to wear the hat way above your head in order to see the print on it.,41785,2
41785,"If you fold the hat to fit properly, you can't see the print on it.",41785,2
41786,"I put that this product fit somewhat large, but only in some places.",41786,2
41786,The halter neck strap was absolutely HUGE.,41786,2
41786,"Around the outside was snug and I'm 5'3"" 122 lb with a B cup.",41786,2
41787,They look cool and fit snug but they are too flat for my face.,41787,2
41787,While wearing them I can see reflections of what's behind me almost like those spy glasses I had when I was a kid.,41787,2
41787,It's pretty annoying and distracting especially when driving.,41787,2
41788,"while I like the texture of the fabric, the cut is super unflattering and bunchy.",41788,2
41789,I bought this for a friend who normally wears a large.,41789,2
41789,"After viewing the sizing chart, I decided to go with an XXL.",41789,2
41789,Thank God because the shirt runs small and it looks a little cheap.,41789,2
41789,I'll give it two stars since delivery time wasn't bad.,41789,2
41790,"In the picture it looks like the shirt is made of T-shirt material, but in actuality it's ribbed.",41790,2
41791,Not what I expected.,41791,2
41791,This swimsuit is a piece of fabric you have to make into a swimsuit top.,41791,2
41792,Very small.,41792,2
41792,"I'm 5'8"" and 145 lbs and I couldn't even get the large over my bum.",41792,2
41792,Very dissapointed.,41792,2
41793,This product came in very small.,41793,2
41793,I would say order 2-3 sizes larger.,41793,2
41793,Also the stitching is sub part.,41793,2
41793,"Though my standards were low,  I did not realize this was going to be such low quality .product when purchased,",41793,2
41794,It was a lot cheaper than it appears in the pictures.,41794,2
41794,The plastic front panel part bulges out and everything is clearly hand painted.,41794,2
41794,The helmet was also too big.,41794,2
41794,Overall the suit fit ok and it did it's job but the quality could definitely be better for the price.,41794,2
41795,Too small for an XL Size.,41795,2
41795,Ended ip giving it to mu sister!,41795,2
41796,Bit on the small side.,41796,2
41797,Had an awful odor.,41797,2
41797,Leather looks very fake.,41797,2
41797,Didn't like how it felt on shoulder.,41797,2
41797,Returned.,41797,2
41798,"size 8-10 came as an XL, too big.",41798,2
41799,I am sure it would have been a good product.,41799,2
41799,I wear an XL and they confirmed to me that XL was for me.,41799,2
41799,The XL was WAY TOO small.,41799,2
41799,Not even close.,41799,2
41799,"However, they were prompt and courteous in their refund and returns.",41799,2
41800,"Even though I purchase a larger size, it's still to small",41800,2
41801,"If you have a butt, don't buy this product.",41801,2
41801,The length is good.,41801,2
41801,"However, it would be better if it had an elastic waist band.",41801,2
41801,The shirt is made of excellent material.,41801,2
41801,I really like the shirt and the little tie.,41801,2
41802,Good quality fabric but the printed image is  very dark and blurry (like low resolution... not enough pixels or something).,41802,2
41802,Also not true to size I wear a size small usually.,41802,2
41802,I ordered a medium because I like these type of shirts to be a little loose but it fit very tightly.,41802,2
41802,Not worth the money,41802,2
41803,Won't be buying these again.,41803,2
41803,"I sleep in them and they ride up, thus giving no protection.",41803,2
41804,cant say much for the price I paid but left handed closure and the rope with all the strings kept coming apart mine now only has one rope so still can be worn,41804,2
41805,"As soon as I open package there was a odd smell, don't know if it was the material but smell was too strong for me.",41805,2
41805,"Also I am 5/4 106 lbs, the fit was pretty good but the length had no room for  shrinkage.",41805,2
41805,I did a refund.,41805,2
41805,Nice color also.,41805,2
41806,"Cheap looking, color isn't particularly nice, poorly made & has no structure",41806,2
41807,Too short and not tight.,41807,2
41808,for smaller people,41808,2
41809,Handle ripped after 1 trip.,41809,2
41810,runs small,41810,2
41811,Ate east to American sizes smaller,41811,2
41812,The sizes run large,41812,2
41813,the size said XXS but it fits HUGE,41813,2
41814,Runs smaller than expected.,41814,2
41814,Make sure to order at least one size larger than most brands.,41814,2
41814,Received quickly.,41814,2
41815,I gave it to my young daughter,41815,2
41816,thought it was a high-low dress (because that's what the picture lookeds  like),41816,2
41817,The item runs really small.,41817,2
41818,I got 2 neutral prints and the rest were girlie.,41818,2
41818,They do soak through to her pants and anything else.,41818,2
41818,I add in a washable pad and it holds.,41818,2
41818,Fit my 2 year old she's around 21 pounds,41818,2
41819,It's not fit to me it was too small,41819,2
41820,"Sized very, very small, very itchy and uncomfortable material",41820,2
41821,The review indicates this runs small but it really is VERY small!,41821,2
41821,I ordered a 3XL because of the review and it didn't fit a friend that wears a medium so I didn't even bother to wrap it and give it to my son who normally wears an XL.,41821,2
41821,I would think a Small or Medium in this would probably fit a youth.,41821,2
41821,"Very, very tight in the shoulders.",41821,2
41821,Short arms.,41821,2
41821,The fabric quality was good for a coat of this price.,41821,2
41821,"A few loose threads in the seams but nothing that couldn't be trimmed and everything appeared that it was sewn well, just not trimmed off.",41821,2
41821,I returned only because of the size and was pleased with the quick attention to my return and refund and ease of processing.,41821,2
41822,"Thick material, draws up when washed.",41822,2
41822,Purchased medium which stops right below your butt.,41822,2
41822,It couldn't be worn as a dress and would make a very awkward shirt.,41822,2
41823,This sweatshirt is waaay smaller than the measurements given in the description.,41823,2
41823,"I'm slim, and can squeeze into it, but I was expecting it to be a lot baggier.",41823,2
41823,"I'm 5'11, 155 lbs, and wear a size 6.",41823,2
41823,"It's really tight across the shoulders, very snug in the arms, and the sleeves are laughably short.",41823,2
41824,Both times I ordered these they were about 3 sizes too small.,41824,2
41824,Cute top but way to small.,41824,2
41825,DOES NOT COME WITH BOTTOMS!!!!!!!,41825,2
41825,I have to tie the blue straps that are under the striped straps in a knot because they are so long.,41825,2
41825,There is no elastic under the bust so I was worried the whole time that my boobs were going to pop out of the bottom.,41825,2
41826,Super small for my regular size,41826,2
41827,"Returned... Strap is about 6 inches too short, and because of the design cannot be easily extended... Might be OK if you are 5' 2"" or less...",41827,2
41828,"The dress fits nicely, but the fabric is very, very cheap.",41828,2
41828,"The material is so thin, it is quite see-through.",41828,2
41828,Don't buy this if you don't have a great slip to wear under it.,41828,2
41829,Wore this hat 2 weekends at softball tournaments and the top is already split.,41829,2
41829,Very disappointed with the quality.,41829,2
41829,The fit is good for larger hat sizes and very comfortable.,41829,2
41829,Just questionable quality.,41829,2
41830,I had to return it as the logo was was not ironed on straight.,41830,2
41831,"Very sheer fabric, I would only wear under a dress or very long shirt.",41831,2
41832,"Sad thing is - this is a beautiful, well-constructed bra.",41832,2
41832,"Problem is, it's sizing is WAY off.",41832,2
41832,"Add two sizes in the bandeau and in the cup as well, and you may have a perfectly fitting, beautifully sheer lacy bra.",41832,2
41832,"My wife scolded me for buying it online for her (as a gift), as it was WAY too small for her to even close...  Oh well, can't blame a hubby for trying.",41832,2
41833,The hand size would be fine but my 3 year old couldn't get his hands through the wrist portion.,41833,2
41833,It isn't elastic and is quite small.,41833,2
41834,this dress is horrible.,41834,2
41834,It is terrible material and is WAY to big even though i ordered according to their size chart.,41834,2
41835,"I like the fabric, I was surprised it was nice and warm and decent quality for the price.",41835,2
41835,However they did not fit.,41835,2
41835,Not even close.,41835,2
41835,"I'm 5'1"", about 200, maybe 210 lbs, I carry all of my weight in my bust and abdomen, and these weren't long enough to get past my thighs.",41835,2
41835,Very disappointing.,41835,2
41835,I guess I'll freeze!,41835,2
41836,"Little narrow, pinched toes.",41836,2
41836,Not as comfy as wanted.,41836,2
41837,The dress is nice.,41837,2
41837,"I am a size 12 in American Eagle jeans, and I ordered a large.",41837,2
41837,"It fit well, except the slip underneath is very short.",41837,2
41837,The reason I only gave it 2 stars is because the dress came in smelling like old fish.,41837,2
41837,I thought it was only the packaging so I thought I would let it air out.,41837,2
41837,"When I came home, my bedroom smelled like the fishy dress!",41837,2
41837,I decided to bring it in my laundry room that is located in the garage.,41837,2
41837,"My entire laundry room, and garage smell like fish now.",41837,2
41837,Took it to the dry cleaner and the smell still exists.,41837,2
41837,It really is unfortunate that I am stuck with this smelly dress because shipping it back would only cost me more money!,41837,2
41838,"The lenses has a glare, kind of looks like blow bubbles are in the lenses.",41838,2
41839,I purchased this for myself in medium and one for my daughter in small.,41839,2
41839,The medium was too small for me and the small was too small for my daughter so I gave her my medium and it was big.,41839,2
41839,We return both of them.,41839,2
41840,love the design...but fitted way to small.. go up at least 2 sizes,41840,2
41841,Kept poking my nipple not very pleasurable,41841,2
41842,Liked these socks but my kid is only in the 50th percentile in weight and already outgrew them at 4.5 months.,41842,2
41842,Sad cause I really liked them.,41842,2
41843,The fringe unravelled in the first wearing.,41843,2
41843,"Didn't bother returning it, just removed all the fringe.",41843,2
41843,Only mildly worth the time and effort.,41843,2
41843,The patten is cute which is why I kept it but they need to seriously look at their quality control.,41843,2
41844,Runs very small- I ordered a XXL and it fit like a Large.,41844,2
41844,Also not as long as shown in picture.,41844,2
41844,The jersey fabric is nice but it doesn't fit well,41844,2
41845,Good size for a 5 yr old but after only 2 months the opening mechanism broke so now it's unusable.,41845,2
41845,Poor quality for the price since we now have to buy a new umbrella.,41845,2
41846,Zipper seems to be very poorly sewed on.,41846,2
41847,Material is very thin,41847,2
41848,It was way off for plus size and fabric was cheap...fit my size 10 teenager although it was suppose to be 2X.,41848,2
41849,Not as expected returned didn't look anything like the photo.,41849,2
41850,"I knew these were Chinese crap, but I didn't expect them to be THIS crappy.",41850,2
41851,The rose part fell off in a week!,41851,2
41852,"I like the vest, good quality, thin but not overly so.",41852,2
41852,The problem is it is about four inches around the waist smaller than it claims.,41852,2
41852,"I decided to order another one in three xl, but normally I wear a one x in terms of shirts, so these are running very small.",41852,2
41853,Broke the first time I  had it on.,41853,2
41853,Very much  disappointed.,41853,2
41853,Hope to get it fixed,41853,2
41854,I have a very shallow piercing and this ring was advertised as being short.,41854,2
41854,"It's not, its like a regular belly ring, so it hangs too long for me.",41854,2
41854,Had to return.,41854,2
41855,"A vest, a tie, a bow tie and a hankie for under $20 .... Should have known it would not be the quality we were looking for.",41855,2
41855,"However, if you need a vest for a single occasion and don't mind rather stiff fabric this is an incredible deal.",41855,2
41855,We however were looking for a vest which will be worn a lot so it won't work for my hubby.,41855,2
41855,Delivery was prompt.,41855,2
41856,Ran huge!,41856,2
41856,Poorly made.,41856,2
41857,Size is ok but you get what you pay for.,41857,2
41857,This is not denim in the true sense of the word (I don't know that to call it).,41857,2
41857,It is certainly not the denim one gets in jeans and other denim shirts.,41857,2
41857,The stitching is awful with crooked seams and many hanging threads.,41857,2
41857,The width of parallel stitches varies and most stitches that are supposed to be straight are not.,41857,2
41857,This is definitely not a shirt I would wear anyplace other than around the house or while working in my yard.,41857,2
41857,"And,I would certainly not purchase another!",41857,2
41858,So beautiful but The skirt is too small !,41858,2
41858,!,41858,2
41858,;-(,41858,2
41859,"Love, but quickly start to loose proper function.",41859,2
41859,Once they get mud or water or just randomly the lights either stay turned on and can't be turned off until the battery runs out and once they stop functioning properly only some lights turn on:/,41859,2
41860,"You'll have to wear booties all the time, at least if you're tall.",41860,2
41860,"I'm 5'9 and these are ""high waters"".",41860,2
41860,"Material is thin too, but they're cheap.",41860,2
41860,"Of course it's not AA, but in comparison to other knock offs it's lacking.",41860,2
41860,I still wear them dressed down,41860,2
41861,The shirt has a nice design but it was too thin.,41861,2
41861,You could see your skin thru it.,41861,2
41862,There is no way that I can get my girls into these tiny pieces.,41862,2
41862,I bought the C/D size (I wear a C bra) and if I put it underneath where it should go then it didn't cover my nips.,41862,2
41862,If I cover those then I'm hanging out the bottom and have weird lumps in places there shouldn't be lumps.,41862,2
41862,"I like that it has a clasp for support, but I'm going to have to find another product that has more coverage.",41862,2
41863,Was not what I expected.,41863,2
41863,I thought this was more like a sweater.,41863,2
41863,The material is thin and it run small.,41863,2
41863,I ended up giving to my daughter.,41863,2
41863,I was not happy with this purchase.,41863,2
41863,It fits very snug like a fitted shirt instead of a cardigan.,41863,2
41864,Two of the eight are mis-sewed and my foot does not go in,41864,2
41865,ran huge and had to be returned.,41865,2
41865,There went my mother in laws mothers day gift.,41865,2
41865,She wasn't very happy,41865,2
41866,"I love these, they fit perfect.",41866,2
41866,Only down side is there seems to be no elastic to hold them up.,41866,2
41866,"They stay in place when worn with boots, but with no boots holding them up, they sag down fast.",41866,2
41867,"Ordered and received 4x size...not even close, I don't think it would fit on a large  !",41867,2
41867,!,41867,2
41868,The color and style of this bikini is beautiful; however the top is much too small and the bottom much too large.,41868,2
41868,"I ordered a Medium, but I must say that when I can, I usually buy a Med top and small bottoms whenever I purchase a bikini from Victoria's Secret for example.",41868,2
41868,"My bust size in 34DD/36C, and I have a very thin lower body, so maybe a girl with smaller chest and larger booty could for perfectly into a Med.",41868,2
41868,"Overall, its a beautiful looking suit!",41868,2
41869,Does.,41869,2
41869,Not look like pic.,41869,2
41869,Not what I expected,41869,2
41870,Had to return.,41870,2
41870,Suitcases had mildew or mold on them,41870,2
41871,If you want to look like a pimp on a bowling vacation this is the shirt for you.,41871,2
41872,They are cute...but looks like lace around the ankle.,41872,2
41872,A little girlish and the bracelet was a cute little extra but for a girl...gave that to my neice.,41872,2
41873,These arrived so crooked.,41873,2
41873,I was able to bend them back into shape but the fit still isn't great.,41873,2
41873,I really got what I paid for with these.,41873,2
41874,I am medium size person and I ordered that size.,41874,2
41874,The sleeveless dress is too small but the sheer cardigan looks lovely hence I am giving the 2-star for the cardigan.,41874,2
41874,I don't know what to do with the sleeveless dress as I am keeping the cardigan.,41874,2
41874,Perhaps I can give it to the thrift shop.,41874,2
41874,I've decided not to return the item because it might cost me more to send it back to China.,41874,2
41875,I bought this item two times.,41875,2
41875,"First pair didn't work, the glasses wouldn't light up, so I had to return and reorder.",41875,2
41875,Second pair had the same issue.,41875,2
41875,It would light up only if you hold the wire in the certain position.,41875,2
41875,"The idea of the glasses is great, but the quality is very poor",41875,2
41876,Very flimsy.,41876,2
41876,It would be nice if they had a bigger handle and zipped up to close and keep things secure,41876,2
41877,not happy size was very wrong .....,41877,2
41878,Normal,41878,2
41879,"The wings were beautiful, but as soon as I put them on one of the elastic straps pulled off.",41879,2
41879,So I had to sew them on to be stronger.,41879,2
41880,"There may be a thin layer of leather there somewhere, but this puppy is primarily rubber-like material.",41880,2
41880,Also wasn't large enough to hold my phone in a Speck case.,41880,2
41880,"Good idea, just needs a bit more work.",41880,2
41881,Hood was freaking tiny and extremely unimpressive.,41881,2
41881,Was also a large tear on the back of the jacket upon arrival.,41881,2
41881,Jacket kinda poofy and somewhat warm for its size and heft.,41881,2
41881,Wasn't happy.,41881,2
41881,Product returned,41881,2
41882,Pouch has some rough seams...and it's a bit snug on the fella.,41882,2
41883,The lenses looked nothing like the photo.,41883,2
41883,They were not polarized.,41883,2
41883,They were poorly mirror-coated.,41883,2
41883,Completely disappointed with the inaccurate product description and the misleading picture.,41883,2
41883,"*My photo was taken indoors, by a window, without a flash (I put the ruler underneath to show that you can see right through the lenses).",41883,2
41883,*,41883,2
41884,"First, the sizes are WAY too small.",41884,2
41884,"Second, I ordered a 24 month (for my 7month old by the way) and they sent me a 3T (which I didn't realize til I washed it and we were at the pool and that was all I had).",41884,2
41884,The 3T wasn't even that big  however for my 18 lb baby.,41884,2
41884,The design is cute but I wish I would've went with a more adjustable brand of reusable swim diaper,41884,2
41885,Its small than expected,41885,2
41886,Not exactly like the picture appears.,41886,2
41886,"Skirt is not pleated and does not splay out in the least, and is probably only 1/3 (the length around) the material in the picture.",41886,2
41886,"Also, it is sewn practically straight (almost like a pencil skirt) with little room to extend a leg forward because material is also taunt.",41886,2
41886,This may also create a weird fold when you sit.,41886,2
41886,Top of dress has a light cotton/jersey feel and is not bad (just very basic) but is slightly disproportionately sized compared to bottom.,41886,2
41886,Gave it a two because I still like the skirt pattern and have no hips.,41886,2
41887,I ordered these leggings for one of my daughters.,41887,2
41887,"They fit her as expected, but the wrappings were on opposite sides!",41887,2
41887,"One leg, bandages on front and the bandages were on the back of the other leg!",41887,2
41887,There was also a small hole on one side.,41887,2
41887,She is quirky so she wore them anyway.,41887,2
41887,I was disappointed that they were not made correctly!,41887,2
41888,thin and small,41888,2
41889,runs three sizes small,41889,2
41890,Doesn't look like it shows in the pic and it is pretty tight at the waist and loose at the top.,41890,2
41890,I wasted $3.50!,41890,2
41890,!,41890,2
41891,Its a beautiful sweater and im sure if it fitted me it wind be great but i ordered a plus size 2x and it doesn't fit,41891,2
41892,Cheap...Very cheap,41892,2
41893,not expected...,41893,2
41894,I love the longer hoodies with a front pocket and was excited to find this online.,41894,2
41894,"I ordered the pink one (pictured as a bright pastel), but what I received was more of a mauve or dusty pink--much darker than what I'd expected and not in my color wheel.",41894,2
41894,"The fit was a bit disappointing, too, as it ran at least one full size too small.",41894,2
41894,Be aware that this hoodie is not made of typical sweatshirt material.,41894,2
41894,"It's a thinner fabric (but not sheer); more like a high quality, reinforced t-shirt material.",41894,2
41894,It is not bulky and does retain body heat well for a fabric that isn't fleece.,41894,2
41894,"There is a outer seam that runs down the length of each sleeve, and and my shirt arrived with a lot of loose threads exposed on one sleeve.",41894,2
41894,"I can trim the loose threads, but it does make me question the quality of the shirt.",41894,2
41895,Sizing was way off.,41895,2
41895,"Elastic sleeves were tight, overall very disappointed in the item.",41895,2
41895,Would not recommend.,41895,2
41896,I opened these and the odor was terrible.,41896,2
41896,I am going to throw these away as it is not worth shipping back.,41896,2
41896,"Poorly made, I would not recommend",41896,2
41897,It was too small,41897,2
41898,too small,41898,2
41899,Not very good quality.,41899,2
41899,Big in all the wrong places even with a size small.,41899,2
41900,"Love the design and the look of the scarf, but it was way too short to even wrap around and wear like a scarf.",41900,2
41900,Disappointed for sure.,41900,2
41901,I'm a large the pants is large but doesn't feel like a large when I put it on.,41901,2
41901,It's too tight.,41901,2
41901,I'm feeling ripped off here.,41901,2
41902,too small,41902,2
41903,The top is not adjustable and the bottom is really snug.,41903,2
41903,But wearable,41903,2
41904,"I'm only 5'3, so naturally the hem is less calf-length and closer to just above my ankles, but I still love this jumper.",41904,2
41904,"Oddly the waist is more empire waist than what is shown in the picture, but again, loving this.",41904,2
41904,I can dress it up or down with a jean jacket and thongs or a dressy cardigan and sandals or heels ...,41904,2
41904,I wish it came in more colors TBH.,41904,2
41904,I gave a 4 instead of a 5 because of the waist not being what is shows in the picture.,41904,2
41904,That's the only drawback for me.,41904,2
41904,"Edit 3/31/16:  After 1st wash, draw string was mangled like a puppy had been chewing on it.",41904,2
41904,I don't have a puppy.,41904,2
41904,"I cut it off and wore it anyway, luckily with a cropped cardi, because one of the buttons in the back popped off mid-day (and this is a loose-fitting jumper so it wasn't because I was stretching it to max capacity).",41904,2
41904,"Nothing that can't be fixed, and I still wear this, and it is totes comfy, but for $30, I expect better quality so I have to change my 4 stars to 2 :(",41904,2
41905,Shirt quality isn't too bad.,41905,2
41905,"Not 100% cotton, but soft enough.",41905,2
41905,My complaint is the spacing of each word.,41905,2
41905,But the words are spaced out like they are broken into syllables...which looks strange.,41905,2
41905,Should have read the other reviews first!,41905,2
41906,beautiful in the picture.,41906,2
41906,"in reality, poorly made, ""looked"" inexpensive, pendant separated from the necklace.",41906,2
41906,"my husband fixed it and we gave it to
our 4 year old grand daughter to play dress-up.",41906,2
41907,small head,41907,2
41908,A little disappointed some of the writing was rubbed off toward the body and took over a month to get here.,41908,2
41909,"It's a cute shirt, however, it runs very small.",41909,2
41909,Be aware there is absolutely no stretch across the chest.,41909,2
41909,"Normally a size medium fits me perfectly, but in this shirt I probably need a XL.",41909,2
41909,"Also, I sent a request to return the item and have not heard back from them.",41909,2
41910,This dress looks nothing like the picture.,41910,2
41910,Its as if the colors were inverted.,41910,2
41910,The dress is more white than black and the design is way off.,41910,2
41911,Looks better in the picture.,41911,2
41912,Had some 32's from a friend I liked but were a tad small.,41912,2
41912,Tried 33's and felt like I was swimming in them.,41912,2
41913,Too small,41913,2
41914,To small,41914,2
41915,Runs small.,41915,2
41915,Hangs weird.,41915,2
41915,And strings hanging everywhere!,41915,2
41915,Not what I was hoping for...,41915,2
41916,It's a good was it trainer but I'm giving to star because it's too small and the hooks were torn,41916,2
41917,My son picked this and it's not awful.,41917,2
41917,It comes in two pieces (buckle and belt) and it fit just fine.,41917,2
41917,It's fairly rigid but that's to be expected.,41917,2
41917,Unfortunately it had the worst mildew-ish smell and has yet to go away.,41917,2
41917,My 16 year old doesn't seem to mind but I hate it when he wears this.,41917,2
41918,The top has no support and is a very cheap material.,41918,2
41918,I wouldnt not recommend it for anyone with big boobs that are real.,41918,2
41919,Ummm....this dress def doesn't look like this pic.,41919,2
41919,It's more high waisted but not in a good way.,41919,2
41919,I normally wear a size small in bottoms and a large in tops bc I'm a 34DD but this was def big on me everywhere.,41919,2
41919,Material is def cheap but I guess thats what you get for the price.,41919,2
41920,TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RETURN IT,41920,2
41921,"Love the color and fit, but THEY ARE NOT 31 inches long!",41921,2
41921,"They measure an inseam of only 30"" and when you are very tall, it matters.",41921,2
41921,Aaargh!,41921,2
41922,It was too small,41922,2
41923,The image made it look like the top was a lot longer than it was and I was really disappointed.,41923,2
41924,"So small, i even went up 2 sizes and its still way to small.",41924,2
41925,It runs small.,41925,2
41925,I would order one size larger than what you are.,41925,2
41926,cheap and white underneath,41926,2
41927,Too small,41927,2
41928,The rose gold finish completely wore off before my daughter even owned it a week.,41928,2
41928,I wouldn't recommend the rose finish.,41928,2
41929,"Beautiful colors and as advertised, but as soon as I put my fingers in the fingertip holder ones of them ripped right off.",41929,2
41929,Poor quality.,41929,2
41930,"I read that these run small in the reviews, so I ordered one size up.",41930,2
41930,"As in, I ordered an adult large, when I need an adult medium.",41930,2
41930,"Unfortunately, these run REALLY, REALLY small.",41930,2
41930,My son wears the same style underwear in a youth large.,41930,2
41930,"When comparing these to my son's undies (Under Armour and Starter brands), they are significantly smaller than the youth large.",41930,2
41930,"If it helps, my son is fairly 5' 6"", 105lbs, 28 inch waist in jeans.",41930,2
41930,"I am 5' 10"", 180lbs, and wear a 33 inch waist in jeans.",41930,2
41930,There is nooo way I can fit into these (see comparison to my Adult Medium pineapple cat prints below).,41930,2
41930,There is no way my son can even fit into these (see comparison to the Youth Large blue undies below).,41930,2
41930,"On the bright side, the fabric and cut are nice.",41930,2
41930,The seams appear to be nice and flat and the waistband is covered in cloth.,41930,2
41930,"In fact, I'd say these are a high quality pair of super soft undies.",41930,2
41930,They are just waaaaay too small.,41930,2
41930,Bummer.,41930,2
41930,I hope I can return them for an XXXL!,41930,2
41931,Gave as a gift.,41931,2
41931,"Cute socks, but only two out of the five were the pattern shown.",41931,2
41931,"The other three were different, and I didn't like them nearly as well as what's shown.",41931,2
41931,"We received the dragon and the octopus shown, but not the yeti, ocean scene, or fish.",41931,2
41931,Instead we received a sea monster and two we can't identify at all.,41931,2
41931,"So be aware that ""Same as the picture shows"" is not accurate!",41931,2
41932,"Cheap/light fabric, doesn't look the same in person.",41932,2
41933,Ordered this bracelet as a birthday gift for someone because of all the wonderful reviews.,41933,2
41933,"When it arrived, the presentation was very nice, but when I took the bracelet out, it looked very cheap and bends extremely easily.",41933,2
41933,The inside almost looks like cheap aluminum.,41933,2
41933,Would consider this costume jewelry and not worth what I paid for it.,41933,2
41933,Very disappointed and ended having to buy something else.,41933,2
41934,"A lot of duplicates, which is to be expected.",41934,2
41934,But the balls fall out sometimes just randomly and the bar is not very resilient.,41934,2
41935,"very odd fit, couldn't seem to figure it out.",41935,2
41935,maybe I'm just dumb lol,41935,2
41936,Looks too much like lingerie for me to wear over a bathing suit.,41936,2
41936,Material is kind of itchy as well and it's very fitted,41936,2
41937,This dress runs small I'm normally a medium but I ordered a large to be safe...,41937,2
41937,It fits like a small and the material is completely see through.,41937,2
41937,Very disappointed,41937,2
41938,"I was so excited to see this in the mail, but when I tried it on, it was literally too small.",41938,2
41938,Was very disappointed.,41938,2
41938,Would not buy again.,41938,2
41939,Band looks nice.,41939,2
41939,Feels good on the wrist.,41939,2
41939,Clasp is not very good.,41939,2
41939,Clasp was very difficult to open right out of the box.,41939,2
41939,"After adjusting the size to fit my wrist, the clasp will not stay latched.",41939,2
41939,"It frequently, randomly pops open.",41939,2
41939,I'm afraid I will lose my watch so I took it off after just a few hours.,41939,2
41940,"Fabric is pretty thin, needs a slip or it is see through.",41940,2
41941,The suit was cute but way too small.,41941,2
41941,"I ordered according to the sizing chart, but apparently I should have ordered at least one size larger.",41941,2
41941,"I'm not a very big person, but I couldn't even get it to cover my chest because it was so short in the torso.",41941,2
41941,I had to send it back.,41941,2
41942,About the only thing good about these sunglasses are that they cover normal eyeglasses.,41942,2
41942,The lenses are blurry and hazy even in direct sunlight.,41942,2
41942,These glasses also do not appear to be polarized.,41942,2
41942,I would not order a second pair even if it were offered free.,41942,2
41943,Very un flattering fit.,41943,2
41943,Nice fabric and design.,41943,2
41943,Some what like a sack fit.,41943,2
41943,Disappointed.,41943,2
41944,I am a 32DDD (36-28-38) and this top was way too small.,41944,2
41944,The bottoms were too big.,41944,2
41944,If I had to guess size only changes for the bottoms.,41944,2
41944,"If you are small chested this will probably work great for you, but larger chested girls will be hanging out.",41944,2
41945,"I'd give more stars but one of the bras arrived with a broken clasp  However, the fit was good and the bras are comfortable.",41945,2
41945,The padding is a little thicker than I'd hoped.,41945,2
41945,I'm glad I got the XL instead of the large.,41945,2
41945,I'm a 34DD and the XL fit like a glove.,41945,2
41945,I hope they send me a new one for the broken one they sent me.,41945,2
41946,Purchased this dress to be used as 1950's themed costume.,41946,2
41946,The skirt has a little bit of flare but it's not a circle skirt as shown here .,41946,2
41946,"It is not bright yellow, but more a pastel yellow.",41946,2
41946,Bought 1 size up and it's still snug.,41946,2
41946,Overall as a costume it's just okay.,41946,2
41947,I don't think the cups are DD.,41947,2
41947,If you have DD-E size breasts you will be bulging out of this top,41947,2
41948,"I have never has this problem before, but the glasses seem a bit too small for my face and they keep sliding down my nose, forcing me to push them back up every 10 seconds (especially if i am eating)

Kind of feel like i wasted my money.",41948,2
41948,"They look cool, but won't stay on my face.",41948,2
41949,Doesn't look good on.,41949,2
41950,Color wasn't as expected and the fit was VERY small.,41950,2
41951,"Nice material and print, cute bow but L fits like a S/XS and is pretty short in length",41951,2
41952,"Durable, but dull, dreary color.",41952,2
41952,I used these to decorate my cubical.,41952,2
41953,Cute brooch but looks cheap and gaudy.,41953,2
41953,Not what I was expecting.,41953,2
41954,It was way too high waisted even for my long torso and too long in the pant length even though my legs are long.,41954,2
41954,I'm going to see if it shrinks when I wash it.,41954,2
41955,Seems pretty cheap when I got it.,41955,2
41956,Arrived broken.....the necklace anyway,41956,2
41957,Waited two months for this to arrive all to discover it is really just more a piece of material than anything.,41957,2
41957,The smell was horrid.,41957,2
41958,Poor Quality,41958,2
41959,"Like the top, the material is very thin",41959,2
41960,It fit my 10 year old but I purchased it for my boyfriend.,41960,2
41960,This short is thin material and runs small.,41960,2
41961,"The kimono is pretty, but after one hand wash, the fringe started unraveling everywhere.",41961,2
41962,Zippers don't work easily.,41962,2
41962,Rubber zipper pulls broke off after one use.,41962,2
41963,"Cheap and small, still very affordable.",41963,2
41964,too large,41964,2
41965,"First, the material feels like a bathing suit.",41965,2
41965,That's not necessarily a bad thing; I just wasn't expecting it.,41965,2
41965,"Second, the flare of the top at the hips is WAY wider than shown in the picture.",41965,2
41965,It looked like I was wearing a fit-and-flare dress except the flare part was around my hips.,41965,2
41965,Not exactly what I'd call flattering.,41965,2
41965,"It also wasn't long enough for me to consider it a tunic, especially if it shrinks a lot in the washer/dryer.",41965,2
41965,I will be returning.,41965,2
41965,"I found that the ""Free to Live"" tunics on Amazon are much more as expected.",41965,2
41966,These are great but a little awkwardly shaped.,41966,2
41966,These might be better for chubby babies.,41966,2
41966,I don't have a particularly chubby baby.,41966,2
41966,He's kind of long and lean.,41966,2
41966,Length is right.,41966,2
41966,"But since it fits a little loser in the arms and tummy area, the fleece sticks to his mattress.",41966,2
41966,Some mornings I find him with both legs in one pant leg.,41966,2
41966,Not very safe.,41966,2
41966,So we stick with the charters brand footie pajamas that we purchased.,41966,2
41967,"Design was the same, but it was very short...",41967,2
41967,"I'm 5'5, and if I raise my arms, the dress goes up to your hips.",41967,2
41967,So you better wear some shorts.,41967,2
41968,"Instead of the C/D size, the tag reads that it is actually A/B.",41968,2
41968,"I have another version of this bra, in the C/D, and absolutely love it!",41968,2
41968,"Unfortunately, the size that arrived will not work for me.",41968,2
41969,Skip it,41969,2
41970,Way to small .,41970,2
41970,They need to specify that it Suns very small and cimes from over seas.,41970,2
41971,Way to short and cheap material.,41971,2
41972,Fit great but the black color of the suede came right off onto my skin from just trying it on,41972,2
41973,looks like tissue paper not a real four leaf clover and it much bigger  than pictured and already a piece broke of inside,41973,2
41974,"If you're an Under Armour fan, I think you'll be dissapointed.",41974,2
41975,The fabric is too stiff and itchy:/,41975,2
41976,Colors with the belts are nice and buckles.,41976,2
41976,"But fabric is thin, first time used the grommets were poking out.",41976,2
41977,Size was not true.,41977,2
41977,Real bummer.,41977,2
41978,I just gave it to someone else,41978,2
41979,This suit came pretty quick for the most part.,41979,2
41979,"I ordered a medium, and I'm about a 32 D in bra size for pink, and normally I wear a medium in pink underwear.",41979,2
41979,"The bottoms were very small, the cup sizes for the top were perfect, but the tie that goes around the back was really tight.",41979,2
41979,There was also an extra space in the 3 strings that go around your neck that wasn't the same as the other side.,41979,2
41979,I am about 5'5 and im 114 pounds.,41979,2
41979,I hope this helps!,41979,2
41980,Waaaaay too small.,41980,2
41980,"The rose petals don't actually stay all around dress, they kinda bunch together weirdly and look like a stain or something.",41980,2
41980,I wasn't thrilled with this purchase at all.,41980,2
41980,I bought 4T and fits like 2T,41980,2
41981,Dress runs small so get a size or two up.,41981,2
41982,Not made for American sizes.,41982,2
41983,bought a medium.,41983,2
41983,guess I'm a large?,41983,2
41983,(5'3.,41983,2
41983,127.9#)  wow.,41983,2
41984,Was posted as a 3xl and we a women's small.,41984,2
41984,Horrible sizing.,41984,2
41984,The top is beautiful and decent quality but sizing was way off.,41984,2
41985,pendant looks like picture but it's not on a choker necklace like it says and no way to adjust it.,41985,2
41985,that was the reason I bought it so I was very dissappointed.,41985,2
41986,"Unfortunately, this did not fit me and I'm 5'2 and 125lbs.",41986,2
41986,I just have a big waist and a big butt.,41986,2
41986,"I was sadly disappointed, but it looks exactly like it does on the website.",41986,2
41987,I've wore it twice and it's scratched.,41987,2
41987,"When you tap the ""glass"" you can tell it's not.",41987,2
41987,It's as plastic as surgery.,41987,2
41987,"It has a nice theme of the inner dial ticket and rotating but for a few more bucks, they could've reinforced the glass dial",41987,2
41988,Love the way it fits.,41988,2
41988,"Since I'm 5'3, the option for getting it Short is amazing.",41988,2
41988,"But unfortunately, only having it for a month & its elastic strings are popping out along the seam of the pants.",41988,2
41988,Not worth the money you spend.,41988,2
41989,The beads were small but nice unfortunately Ithe elastic bracelet was afraid in a couple of places I will need to get it fixed.,41989,2
41990,It doesn't look like in the photo.,41990,2
41990,The sleeves are a weird fabric,41990,2
41991,"The material is polyester, which I hadn't realized when I ordered.",41991,2
41991,"I would have lived with my mistake if not for the fact that this particular material has a very unpleasant, almost sticky feel to it.",41991,2
41991,"In addition, the sleeves are made for pencil-thin arms, which few people have.",41991,2
41992,Love iy,41992,2
41993,Too big,41993,2
41994,Shirt does NOT come loosely fit like the pic.,41994,2
41994,It's cute but it fits VERY SMALL!,41994,2
41995,"I am 5'2"" 110 lbs and ordered a Medium - the coat fit snugly, but well.",41995,2
41995,The reason for the low score is that the quality of this garment is low.,41995,2
41995,The coat is thin.,41995,2
41995,I washed it in a garment bag when I got it and four buttons fell off.,41995,2
41995,I could tell they would when looking at how they were sown.,41995,2
41995,The buttons themselves are plastic with a gold coating on them which was scratching off when the coat arrived.,41995,2
41995,"There are two slash pockets on the sides but one is sown so that when you put your hand in, it is going in the wrong direction (you would have to turn your hand backwords for it to fit).",41995,2
41995,"All of that said, once I buy different buttons and iron it out it will be wearable - the seaming and cut is flattering.",41995,2
41996,A novelty gift for a relative.,41996,2
41996,Broke quickly.,41996,2
41996,Too many wires and bulbs.,41996,2
41997,"This  is  super soft cotton, which is great .",41997,2
41997,Not so great is its not the  product shown in the picture .,41997,2
41997,I expected something  woven .,41997,2
41997,If you  like a Soft cotton with print then this is for you .,41997,2
41998,Seems to be a bit small and a bit awkward.,41998,2
41999,Seem kind of cheap.,41999,2
41999,"Lens is too narrow, top to bottom.",41999,2
41999,Bifocal line is too high and fairly visible.,41999,2
41999,Not worth the price.,41999,2
42000,Inexpensive looking when on.,42000,2
42000,Almost plastic,42000,2
42001,I've been using this for a month and the top compartment already ripped after the 3rd use.,42001,2
42001,"I suppose I can sew the edge back, but I know it's not going to last much longer.",42001,2
42001,"If you actually fill up all 3 compartments, you will have trouble closing the bag since it's held together by 2 magnetic circular clasps.",42001,2
42001,"The outside material feels good enough, and the overall bag is simple, clean looking.",42001,2
42001,"However, I don't think the mesh will last if you use this heavily or pack a lot of items.",42001,2
42001,"I'd recommend this for someone who packs very lightweight, no bulky items, and who uses this a few times a year for light travel.",42001,2
42001,"Otherwise, there are better bags out there for travel and daily use.",42001,2
42001,"For my use, I'll look for a wider travel bag with stronger mesh, so I can pack more products and be able to close the bag nicely.",42001,2
42002,"I was kind of disappointed with these, but I really didn't read the description closely enough.",42002,2
42002,They are completely seamless and sort of look like pajama botttoms.,42002,2
42002,I was looking for something a little more substantial.,42002,2
42003,its too short.,42003,2
42003,I'd like to return it....for a longer one,42003,2
42004,"Fabric is cheap and shiny, seems like it will snag and tear easily.",42004,2
42004,Picks up pet hair easily and won't let go.,42004,2
42004,Does not fit fully over the bump: ~3/4 the way up which is not quite comfortable.,42004,2
42004,"I'm 6.5 months pregnant, carrying high.",42004,2
42005,The hat has extra fabric in crown making it appear puffy and wrinkly on top.,42005,2
42005,It does not fit snug.,42005,2
42005,The quality seems fine but the puffiness is a problem.,42005,2
42006,not my favorite purchase.,42006,2
42006,It is a little short for me to wear as a dress even with leggings.,42006,2
42006,Th print is nice though so I will prob wear with some jeans and a crop jacket.,42006,2
42006,Glad I read the other reviews and up sized my order or it would not have fit.,42006,2
42007,This shirt is very pretty but way too small.,42007,2
42007,The extra large fits like a medium.,42007,2
42008,I received this dress - shipped very quickly.,42008,2
42008,"I love the quality of the dress, the small fit just perfectly.",42008,2
42008,My disappointment is with the color.,42008,2
42008,"First it is not yellow, it is mustard - fine I can accept that.",42008,2
42008,But what I hated is that the whole dress is mustard including the lace which I thought was supposed to be white or off white depending on the reviews.,42008,2
42008,"I have a entire mustard dress, and that is not what I was anticipating - I also did not receive the ""free belt"" with the dress.",42008,2
42008,It seems as if Gown Town Company were in a hurry to make the dresses and get them shipped out.,42008,2
42008,It is not what I wanted.,42008,2
42008,I wanted that beautiful dress in the photo....Trying to decide if I can stomach it and live with an entire mustard dress or return for a refund.,42008,2
42008,Didn't get what I ordered........,42008,2
42009,The bottom fit perfect but the top was more for an A or B cup.,42009,2
42009,I wish they were sold as separates.,42009,2
42010,The dress is gorgeous itself.,42010,2
42010,Very heavy and seems to be well made.,42010,2
42010,However it looked more like a women's size 12 than a girl's size 12.,42010,2
42010,"Make sure you take accurate measurements, as it runs very big.",42010,2
42011,Had to order 2 to get the correct sizes as the top and bottom in either size didn't fit well and had to mix and match the 2.,42011,2
42012,"Im 5'4 120lbs, usually wear small shirts so I bought a size small.",42012,2
42012,"It was too short in the back and the sleeves were not long enough either, the fabric was also a little thin...I don't like returning things so I just gave it to my sister",42012,2
42013,very chinzy material,42013,2
42014,Looks cheap.,42014,2
42015,"Boxy, short and poor proportions.",42015,2
42015,Not like photo.,42015,2
42016,It wouldn't fit over my boobs.,42016,2
42016,I am 40ddd and it wouldn't close.,42016,2
42016,I got the 2xl.,42016,2
42017,If you want to loom like a fly...,42017,2
42017,These are the glasses for you.,42017,2
42017,Maybe Halloween :)  fit good,42017,2
42018,I only gave it 2 stars because it's DMB but what you get is not what is pictured.,42018,2
42018,Whoever made the shirt obviously doesn't know how to put a decal on a shirt there is a double image printed on it and the Dave Mathews band wording is almost unreadable.,42018,2
42018,No tracking info either just randomly showed up when it felt like.,42018,2
42018,Would like another shirt to replace this crappy one,42018,2
42019,They WERE awesome up until the plastic color coating wore off just after one day of wear.,42019,2
42019,"It's disappointing, they looked good initially.",42019,2
42019,"But as for the regular silver tone rings, they still work well and are comfortable enough.",42019,2
42019,"Just a heads up tho, it works its way out of the nostril while you're sleeping.",42019,2
42020,Quality sucks.,42020,2
42020,"Washed it once before our trip, and the gold neck  embellishments tore away from the fabric.",42020,2
42020,Not worth $$,42020,2
42021,meh.,42021,2
42021,just didn't like them.,42021,2
42022,Its the gildan brand you can purchase the same hoodie and take it to a cloth printer place which will cost you like $15 this is a total scam paid $50 for what i coulve paid way less,42022,2
42023,This dress fit my daughter as was explained in the description.,42023,2
42023,The quality was very poor.,42023,2
42023,I am not an expert on dresses but it seemed more like something of a costume nature rather than a formal dress.,42023,2
42023,We sent this item back.,42023,2
42024,Liked the quality and fabric.,42024,2
42024,I ordered the size I usually wear.,42024,2
42024,But...the shirt was too tight.,42024,2
42024,Especially the skeeves.,42024,2
42024,Some may like a tight fitting garment but I found this shirt uncomfortable.,42024,2
42024,It does not come in extra large.,42024,2
42024,I have returned it.,42024,2
42025,Not satisfied.,42025,2
42025,It's way too big for my head.,42025,2
42025,The color is darker than the picture and the wig is way too long.,42025,2
42026,Does not live upto the hype and price.,42026,2
42026,The fabric is light which is fine with me but it bunches up like a $2 pair for hanes.,42026,2
42026,Very disappointed.,42026,2
42027,"I also ordered this -- they're actually the same: USex Sense Men Sexy Briefs Low Rise Jockstrap (Pack of 2) (Xl, Black+red) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0192Q5S9U/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_mzEqxb9YKZCWW

This version is more expensive as the other is a 2-pack.",42027,2
42027,"Both come in same packaging labeled ""chuanlangwj"" and tags are identical ""Wang Jiang""

I'll keep and see if anybody wants it.",42027,2
42027,A bit tight though.,42027,2
42028,These were terrible.,42028,2
42028,They were way small and then I had to pay what I paid for them in the first place to ship them back.,42028,2
42029,came out quite plain and simple.,42029,2
42029,it was a bit loose and didn't look like much other than a salmon colored blob,42029,2
42030,I am unhappy with these underware.,42030,2
42030,"The fabric is supposed to stretch with lycra, but it appears tobe just cotton.",42030,2
42030,Also the colors sent are horrible dark purples.,42030,2
42030,Why can't I ever get what I order from Hanes.,42030,2
42030,The quality is worse all the time.,42030,2
42030,"The fit is fine, & the rise is good, but the fabric isn't what I ordered.",42030,2
42031,Way too small not even close to the size offered.,42031,2
42031,Material is nice though and is well stiched.,42031,2
42032,The color is completely different from the picture and I dint like it.,42032,2
42032,It's shiny and much lighter.,42032,2
42032,I'll never buy from this co. Again.,42032,2
42032,This is my second disappointment.,42032,2
42033,The neck is a lot higher than what's photographed.,42033,2
42033,"The fabric is really thin, and it's just overall not very flattering--like a sack more or less.",42033,2
42033,"That said, it is very comfortable and hides the stomach area quite well.",42033,2
42034,"Love the colors, but I have a long torso.",42034,2
42034,"After one wash, these don't even cover my belt line.",42034,2
42034,"They would probably be find for yard work, but if you're looking for a true layering piece, this probably isn't it.",42034,2
42035,This sweater is very thin but pretty much as pictured.,42035,2
42035,The only problem was it stretched out a lot by the end of the day.,42035,2
42035,The sleeves started off around my wrist and were past my hands by the end of the day.,42035,2
42036,"cheap and i am like a 34 waist and a XXL barely fits, the pouch is too small and is just all around sheap.",42036,2
42037,"The material is completely see-through, and the measurements listed on the website for the sizes are unrealistic.",42037,2
42037,"Get a size or two larger, and buy something to wear underneath if you plan on getting this dress.",42037,2
42037,The outer material feels flimsy and cheap.,42037,2
42038,Not sure how these are supposed to work but they did not stay in the position as advertised.,42038,2
42038,I sent them back.,42038,2
42038,They fell out of my ears very quickly.,42038,2
42039,Too small.,42039,2
42039,"This dress isn't flare, it's very tight and short.",42039,2
42039,Not a good fit at all.,42039,2
42039,Very disappointing.,42039,2
42040,THEY DONT STAY ON THE FOOT,42040,2
42041,"If you have thick, full hair, this product is not for you.",42041,2
42041,I was so disappointed when I tried it on :-(,42041,2
42042,Kind of cheaply made and HUGE.,42042,2
42042,I bought this to use in a daith piercing.,42042,2
42042,It is so large it barely fits in my ear.,42042,2
42042,The clicker part does not line up very easily.,42042,2
42042,The gem fell out after about a week of use.,42042,2
42043,"The stone and model is quite pretty but the material is bad quality, it tarnished in less than a month.",42043,2
42044,I am not pleased with this item.,42044,2
42044,"When the screen cover is placed on the phone, there are air bubbles that I am not able to remove.",42044,2
42045,Cute romper but very poor quality of buttons.,42045,2
42045,Wore it one time and button already broke,42045,2
42046,"Cheap quality, way too big, awful scent to it",42046,2
42047,The picture makes it look like the lace is purple but it is all black.,42047,2
42047,That wouldn't be a problem but the photo was very misleading.,42047,2
42048,Arrived fine but does not look as picture shows.,42048,2
42048,The image was partially corrupted.,42048,2
42049,bottoms fit well top is smaller than the size should be,42049,2
42050,It was narrow at the top and wide at the bottom.,42050,2
42051,Way smaller than described.,42051,2
42052,I'm a Size Large.,42052,2
42052,My Boobs Aren't Even That Big But It Wouldn't Even Close In the Back Because The Little Of What I Have On My Chest Just Didn't Fit,42052,2
42053,Too small,42053,2
42054,"I gave 2 stars due to how pretty they are but that being said, Amazon needs to state that they are made for small nipples only, i have larger nipples and they do not fit, was a waste of money",42054,2
42055,it was cheap and shipped fast but mine broke like a week later ): is not made well at all but if you're never going to wear it its worth the price (the stone fell out right away),42055,2
42056,"Poor quality, made in China, very sheer.",42056,2
42057,Size runs small.,42057,2
42057,Jeans are tapered leg.,42057,2
42057,Shirt was thinner than expected and almost seemed a bit feminine in design.,42057,2
42058,Size chart was way off.,42058,2
42059,Shrunk when washed and dried.,42059,2
42059,Had to pass it on to junior sized cousin,42059,2
42060,MATERIAL TOO CHEAP!,42060,2
42061,"no stretch, way too small",42061,2
42062,I bought this shirt thinking it would fit like in the picture definitely not.,42062,2
42062,And to make it worse it shrunk small enough to fit a doll.,42062,2
42062,If you're a size small I'd buy a large,42062,2
42063,I did not like the quality,42063,2
42064,"The rouched section on the top is very small, so unless you have shoulders like a pixie, the rouching will cut off about halfway down the boob -- and I'm an A cup, so it's not like I have big boobs to cover.",42064,2
42064,The abbreviated bust looks very strange.,42064,2
42064,"It is also longer than I expected, and the length looks a little gross.",42064,2
42064,"Though the dress fit without being too tight, the proportions were really strange.",42064,2
42064,"Between the tiny rouched bust, the small space allotted for your butt, and the long length, I have no idea what measurements they expect a size large woman to have.",42064,2
42064,"It's almost as if they just think ""large"" means ""tall.""",42064,2
42064,"I put it on and wore it around my apartment for a couple of hours, and the rouched bust kept creeping up even more, making it look even weirder.",42064,2
42064,"Basically, don't buy this unless you're very slender EVERYWHERE.",42064,2
42064,"Also, I tried to return, and it was a nightmare.",42064,2
42064,Cost to return was almost as much as the dress itself.,42064,2
42064,Not worth it.,42064,2
42064,"The seller tried to convince me that I did, in fact, like the dress.",42064,2
42064,"Eventually I got half of the cost back, but I'm still out money for a dress that is awful.",42064,2
42065,I was disappointed with the jewelry when I got it.,42065,2
42065,It is much bigger in person and a little over the top.,42065,2
42065,"It is so apparently fake that there is no way I can give them to my bridesmaids to wear to my wedding, which was a huge disappointment.",42065,2
42065,I don't recommend these unless you are doing a dress up for Halloween.,42065,2
42066,"I did everything right prior to ordering these leggings, including read multiple reviews and check the seller's feedback scores.",42066,2
42066,"Based on other positive reviews, I ordered these, only to have them arrive with the right leg measuring almost TWO INCHES longer than the left!",42066,2
42066,How did this past quality control / inspection!?,42066,2
42066,How did no one catch this gross defect!?,42066,2
42066,Now I have to waste my personal free time hemming these so they're symmetrical.,42066,2
42066,SO FRUSTRATING!,42066,2
42067,"No problem with the quality of the product itself, just order the x-large but received the short lenght in the x-large package.",42067,2
42068,I liked the socks they were too small.,42068,2
42068,"I wear a size 13 shoe and the socks, although were advertised to size 13, are way too small.",42068,2
42068,I would really like them if they were bigger.,42068,2
42069,Cute but too small and not easy to return.,42069,2
42069,I am stuck with it!,42069,2
42070,"The dress was to thin in the fabric and to long in size , it didn't look right on .",42070,2
42071,"The tights are supper cute, but were really small around my waist.",42071,2
42071,"They are ""a one size fits all"" but be careful if you are heavier around the stomach.",42071,2
42071,Im a size 12.,42071,2
42072,Ordered a small and it was basically two different sizes... got an XS too and L bottom.,42072,2
42072,Both said small but that was def.,42072,2
42072,Not the case here!,42072,2
42072,Buyer beware of the sizing!,42072,2
42073,Love it but it doesn't fit,42073,2
42074,This dress ran way too small -- not true to size at all.,42074,2
42074,My size-12 daughter could not zip up the size 16.,42074,2
42075,Stones fell out after a few days,42075,2
42076,It's okay at first the then the print quickly starts to chip,42076,2
42077,too large,42077,2
42078,It is extremely thin and I returned it.,42078,2
42079,way too small.,42079,2
42079,I ordered a large.,42079,2
42079,And I wear a size 6 in pants.,42079,2
42079,just crazy.,42079,2
42080,it barely covered my boobs.,42080,2
42080,"it literally just covered the bottomg portion of my boob, and the rest hung out.",42080,2
42080,the waist band doesnt stretch as much as i thought.,42080,2
42080,"not a terrible product, but i wouldn't recommend.",42080,2
42080,it serves its purpose for the price you pay.,42080,2
42081,Top fit great but the bottoms were a little too tight,42081,2
42082,Cute but way too,42082,2
42083,Too small and also proved to be too expensive to return.,42083,2
42083,Nice looking but order with care!,42083,2
42084,I thought it was a cute idea in a underwear but way to small.,42084,2
42084,"I weigh 120 ,size 7 and I don't have a huge booty and it was extremely tight too small To even put on .",42084,2
42084,They need to make these panty in different sizes,42084,2
42085,Way to big and bulky!,42085,2
42085,Doesn't look too cheap though!,42085,2
42086,the sizeing chart was somewhat confussing so I gave it to someone else instead of returning it,42086,2
42087,This sweatshirt is not tapered as it appears in the photo.,42087,2
42087,And the emblem on the front is not attractive.,42087,2
42087,"The off center zipper is not a fashion statement, it looks like a mistake.",42087,2
42087,"It is somewhat warm, so instead of sending it back, I will keep it.",42087,2
42088,Falling apart 3 months in.,42088,2
42088,Many of the slots are not wide enough for 20mm or more.,42088,2
42088,It worls ok but vynyl material or plastic outer covering is sloughing off.,42088,2
42088,DO NOT BUY THIS,42088,2
42089,This shirt is really small.,42089,2
42089,"Super stretchy, but it's not oversized and loose like the picture.",42089,2
42089,It's pretty tight and unflattering.,42089,2
42089,And the fabric feels awful.,42089,2
42089,"It's some sort of stretchy, knockoff spandex stuff.",42089,2
42089,Not a fan at all.,42089,2
42090,Arrived with dead battery.,42090,2
42091,"This is my second purchase of the ""Lace Effects"" edition.",42091,2
42091,I LOVED the first ones I got.,42091,2
42091,They were very pretty and subtle.,42091,2
42091,"The ones I got this time are cute, but definitely not the same and not subtle.",42091,2
42091,"Also, they have a print, but it looks nothing like lace.",42091,2
42091,"The description did say assorted colors, which I expected, but it did not say colors would vary.",42091,2
42092,runs very small,42092,2
42093,Very cheaply made.,42093,2
42093,Very disappointed.,42093,2
42094,This shirt is extremely short.,42094,2
42094,I got a medium and it barely hits my pant line.. definitely not as long as the picture shows.,42094,2
42094,not something you can were with yoga pants unless your okay with showing everything!,42094,2
42094,for reference I'm 5'8 130lb.,42094,2
42095,Ok,42095,2
42096,wore it twice and stitching came undone,42096,2
42097,Poor fit and fabrication.,42097,2
42098,Kind of fits like a shiny grocery bag,42098,2
42099,I wanted to love this dress so much but the back of the dress up by the shoulders was really baggy and unflattering,42099,2
42100,The top gives me a great shape and support but the quality of this product is terrible.,42100,2
42100,The straps broke the first time I tied them and the underwire is already poking through on one cup after 2 wears.,42100,2
42101,This bra is super comfy like all of the other reviews mentioned.,42101,2
42101,The reason I only it 2 stars is that I've had it for less than 4 months and the seams are already ripping and it will need to be replaced.,42101,2
42101,"I'd consider buying it again because it was so comfy, but I haven't even used it/washed it often (around 5 machine washes and a dozen hand washes) and for that reason I won't waste my money and I can't recommend this bra.",42101,2
42102,Looks great runs small,42102,2
42103,It's ok at best.,42103,2
42103,"It was well packaged, came on time and looks to be well-made though the lining hung weird where the slit begins.",42103,2
42103,I am thinking it is because it was super tight around my bust and under my arms causing the entire thing to be out of alignment.,42103,2
42103,"I am 5'6"" about 140-145 lbs and normally wear a US size 6 or 8.",42103,2
42103,I ordered a size 8.,42103,2
42103,"If you decide to order this dress, please order a size or 2 larger than you normally wear.",42103,2
42103,"It will cost upwards of $100 to send back to return, so I'm giving this to my niece.",42103,2
42104,They came smaller than picture.,42104,2
42105,Don't waste your money.,42105,2
42106,"I like the high waist, but really you get what you pay for here.",42106,2
42106,"Material is cheap, picks up all kinds of debris-dog hair in my case, and it is NOT breathable.",42106,2
42106,"Also, the fatal flaw of leggings- they're see-through.",42106,2
42107,This fit my body ok witch I'm 140 pounds and I'm 5'2 it was a little long also but the sleeves don't look like that .,42107,2
42107,like they don't fold nicely down draping off your shoulder the way they do in the pic they lift up and it looks stupid.,42107,2
42107,I do have thick arms but either way no girl!,42107,2
42107,Plus p.s u cannot weir this without a belt it would look dumb!,42107,2

42108,"But it took over a month to get to my house, and now it runs way too small.",42108,2
42109,Piece of crap broke within five minutes of getting it stone fell out cheaply made don't waste your money,42109,2
42110,Adorable dress.,42110,2
42110,"Kind of thin, so will need a slip under most likely.",42110,2
42110,"Like the reviews said, the top is too small.",42110,2
42110,I ordered and extra large due to being pregnant for extra room and currently am a 36 B/C...,42110,2
42110,Smaller than what and XL should fit.,42110,2
42110,"The top, black part is 6 inches tall at middle in front.",42110,2
42110,Not enough to cover cleavage and entire bust...,42110,2
42110,So either you are inappropriately hanging out there or the colored skirt part rises up onto your boob.,42110,2
42110,It's awkward and I'm upset.,42110,2
42110,Probably will try to fix the top part somehow.,42110,2
42111,It's somewhat small but I still love it,42111,2
42112,I thought the bracelet was beautiful however it was very thin and broke the same day that I wore it.,42112,2
42113,Not warm at all.,42113,2
42114,Very wrong color.,42114,2
42114,Brick red turns out to be bright orange.,42114,2
42115,I don't like to complain but the shirt just isn't a 2XL.,42115,2
42115,And the seams go down the sides.,42115,2
42115,I didn't know that or it would have been a deal breaker.,42115,2
42115,I will say the delivery was prompt and the packaging was professional.,42115,2
42116,"They don't breathe at all, and are actually kind of difficult to wash.",42116,2
42117,The fabric is pretty but it's not as long as the model has it ESP if you have hips.,42117,2
42117,I'm pear shaped.,42117,2
42117,5'7 177 lbs most weight in my thighs and I got an xl.,42117,2
42117,It fit but was snug on the bottom and huge on top.,42117,2
42117,The drawstring helps but not enough for me to love it.,42117,2
42117,I gave it away.,42117,2
42117,The blue is exactly as shown,42117,2
42118,"Fit great when I took it out of the package,  then when I washed it it shrunk in length and didn't fit as well as it did before",42118,2
42119,The shirt looks nice but even though I bought one size too big it looked and was too small for me.,42119,2
42119,I can't wear it at all.,42119,2
42120,VERY thin fabric so its see-through and it came with many strings hanging off of it.,42120,2
42120,The shoulder was also sewed wrong making it look ugly.,42120,2
42120,Do not recommend!,42120,2
42121,it was not what I expected.,42121,2
42121,it was too thin and not like the picture.,42121,2
42121,I gave it to my sister.,42121,2
42122,"This is a really cute shirt but made really poorly, I am viewing it as a disposable shirt, I'm sure I'll only get a couple wears out of it, that is if it makes it through the wash",42122,2
42123,No son originales,42123,2
42124,Lost 2 of the O rings in the first hour I wore them!,42124,2
42124,Looked at myself in the mirror and noticed they were both missing what the heck!,42124,2
42124,Can't believe they didn't even last a day!,42124,2
42125,Not for me.,42125,2
42125,The pattern was much brighter than the picture.,42125,2
42125,Had to pay a restocking fee when returned.,42125,2
42125,Won't be ordering from here again.,42125,2

42128,Disappointed :(,42128,2
42129,"The item is to much small,",42129,2
42130,It wasn't a extra small more like a large,42130,2
42131,Seam ripped on first wash.,42131,2
42131,Besides short sleeves (which you can roll up) it's a great shirt.,42131,2
42132,"It is beautiful but it came missing one stone, my gift is ruined",42132,2
42133,Not as cute as expected.,42133,2
42133,The padding in it makes the fit a little awkward.,42133,2
42134,They said it is waterproof and the water runs out It does NOT hold up to the rain,42134,2
42135,The Size was super small on me.,42135,2
42135,It did not fit my butt part.,42135,2
42135,I am usually a size 7 in jeans or 28.,42135,2

42140,"If you have to buy it, buy one size larger.",42140,2
42141,I bought this for my 3 month old granddaughter.,42141,2
42141,It came with a shirt my 3 year old granddaughter wears and pants for a 12 month old except they have feet in them.,42141,2
42141,However the shirt is adorable on her which is why I gave it 2 stars,42141,2
42142,It was made for a much smaller person:(,42142,2
42143,The black lace comes off of the top very quickly!,42143,2
42144,Daughter hated it.,42144,2
42144,Very cheap looking.,42144,2
42145,Okay,42145,2
42146,"while the waist fit perfectly as did the length, the top was monstrously huge.",42146,2
42146,I would need a Jessica Rabbit figure to fill this thing out.,42146,2
42146,"I'm 5' 7"", 135 lbs, 34C; the cups on this dress were for someone 40 Fff.",42146,2
42147,Larger than expected,42147,2
42148,I ordered a larger size coz of the reviews about it running small.,42148,2
42148,The material is really cheap & the buttons shoddy .,42148,2
42148,Unfortunately it's still hanging in my closet - never worn it .,42148,2
42148,I regret the buy .,42148,2
42149,"Beware, this skirt is VERY short.",42149,2
42149,"The straps just aren't long enough, and there isn't anyway to sew them to make them longer.",42149,2
42149,"I'm 5'2"", 120 lbs, and I ordered a medium, just because people said it was small, but I didn't realize it would be THAT short.",42149,2
42149,"I can only wear it with leggings underneath, which I hate doing.",42149,2
42149,I ended up cutting the straps off and sewing it and using it as a skirt.,42149,2
42150,The watch band is WAY too big and can not remove the links unless you take to a jeweler.,42150,2
42151,lightweight but feels really uncomfortable on my wrist.,42151,2
42151,can't wear it for long periods of time without feeling the effects.,42151,2
42152,I thought that it would be elastic and conform to your body.,42152,2
42152,Instead it was lose and not very good for working out.,42152,2
42153,"After waiting a month, I finally received my necklace.",42153,2
42153,Its not exactly like the picture advertised for purchase.,42153,2
42153,The picture shows a nice sized glow in the dark nugget that takes up majority of the cage.,42153,2
42153,I received a little bb sized ball.,42153,2
42153,"Tested the glow effect, worked but didn't last.",42153,2
42153,I recently read about skin turning green.,42153,2
42153,HOPEFULLY that doesn't happen.,42153,2
42153,I'll update if it does...,42153,2
42154,Size is not accurate.,42154,2
42154,Only the bottom part fits.,42154,2
42155,"The picture shows it loose, long sleeves and long.",42155,2
42155,It was not loose.,42155,2
42155,It was cut very short.,42155,2
42155,It was also barley 3/4 sleeves.,42155,2
42155,Very unhappy hope I can return.,42155,2
42156,Does have EXTREMELY small screws you need to undo to get the batteries in and even with a magnifying glass and a tiny tiny screw driver I still wasn't able to get it open to put batteries in it.,42156,2
42156,"The toy itself is nice but if you cannot get the plastic thingy open to put the batteries in, not worth the price.",42156,2
42157,cloth material feels pretty cheap and the picture is already rubbing off in a couple places after only a few washes :(,42157,2
42158,Looks too big and gaudy so I won't be wearing it.,42158,2
42158,"Pretty design, just wish it were smaller.",42158,2
42159,Not what i expected.,42159,2
42159,They were very large.,42159,2
42160,Way too small!,42160,2
42161,Really small in the cups.,42161,2
42162,Ordered it a size bigger than suggested and they ended up being too short with too big of a waist.,42162,2
42162,I won't be ordering these again.,42162,2
42162,The design is what caught my eye.,42162,2
42163,Had to send it back...was way too short,42163,2
42164,The shipping was really fast and the dress it's self is pretty.,42164,2
42164,I was so very disappointed with the length of the dress.,42164,2
42164,"I'm 5'6 , wear a  size 5 and it hits me mid shin.",42164,2
42164,This model must be 4 feet tall.,42164,2
42165,Good product for the money.,42165,2
42165,"It fits snug, but then again, I'm fat.",42165,2
42165,"And if you have to use the bathroom before riding ... well, you might as well strip, because that's what you will have to do.",42165,2
42165,Try that in a port-pottie without letting anything but your shoes touch the floor.,42165,2
42165,OK...follow up on this one.,42165,2
42165,"After the fourth wash, the stitches started coming out of the shorts and not at stress points.",42165,2
42165,I doubt this suit will stay together for an entire summer.,42165,2
42165,I have lowered the rating from four stars to two.,42165,2
42166,"Although, the waist trainer fits perfectly, I have only been wearing the waist trainer for a week and the medal rods are already busting through the seams .",42166,2
42166,Not to confident on the body transition results with this problem.,42166,2
42167,Bottoms ripped after 2-day wear,42167,2
42168,The body part fit right but it was like a junior cup size for the bra part.,42168,2
42168,Wish they had bigger cup sizes.,42168,2
42169,these were huge on me and the gold metal is just painted on.,42169,2
42170,"I wanted to love this shirt, but unfortunately it was very small.",42170,2
42171,Inordered an XL due to reviews saying it runs so small....,42171,2
42171,"I normally wear a small or medium in jackets, this XL is TIGHT!!!!",42171,2
42171,This jacket DEFINITLY runs VERY SMALL!!!,42171,2
42171,It's LONG but very fitted!,42171,2
42171,Send more like a child's size jacket e belt VERY LONG!,42171,2
42171,I ordered blue and received gray!,42171,2
42171,"Which would be ok Because I like gray, however it's very tight narrow and therefore the ruffles POOF out at the thigh area making the coat look very weird almost like a poofy ballroom dress at the bottem :(
What a bummer!",42171,2
42171,"If this coat was sized correctly, and ran bigger, it would probably lay nicely and I'd love it!",42171,2
42171,It's going back!,42171,2
42172,"I generally wear a large, but the extra large is tiny on me.",42172,2
42172,Don't buy unless you're already tiny and then go up too sizes.,42172,2
42173,Got these pajama pants and was super excited about them and how comfy they were till I put them on and noticed a huge hole in the crotch area.,42173,2
42173,Very disappointing,42173,2
42174,Bottoms fit nicely but top is just a long pieces of stretchy material.,42174,2
42175,"Before washing, fit fine.",42175,2
42175,After washing this shrunk up so much it was shocking.,42175,2
42175,I have purchased French Toast brand in the past but this definitely was not the same quality shirt that I bought through other retailers.,42175,2
42175,I am returning all of them.,42175,2
42176,See through.,42176,2
42176,Not worth it.,42176,2
42177,Rather than flowing at the bottom it flares.,42177,2
42177,I'm going to have to take it to get hemmed to take away the flare.,42177,2
42178,too small,42178,2
42179,This was ordered to go along with a costume my son was wearing.,42179,2
42179,"Although the product was exactly what was pictured ad, the box that item was shipped in was bent in half when arrived.",42179,2
42179,As result of box being bent in half the pole was cracked.,42179,2
42179,Thinking it was just a one time error I ordered another so we could have it by the end of the week.,42179,2
42179,Once again the box was bent in half  when arrived with pole being cracked again as well.,42179,2
42179,Since We needed them for an event that weekend I used black tap to fix them and brought the 2 along.,42179,2
42179,"Having a child use them, the 2 only lasted about an hour each before both got broken once again.",42179,2
42179,I believe price is a little steep for something so flimsy.,42179,2
42180,I liked the look very much!,42180,2
42180,But the watch was not working :(,42180,2
42181,The straps refuse to stay buckled and the smell at first was a nightmare.,42181,2
42181,Ugh.,42181,2
42182,it fit too big on my head and also the material wasn't as expected it was unconfortable and also it had a crease mark right in the front!,42182,2
42182,better packaging and better product quality would have been a plus!!,42182,2
42182,!,42182,2
42183,Extremely short.,42183,2
42183,It actually fits like a shirt.,42183,2
42183,Do not go by the picture!,42183,2
42183,:(,42183,2
42184,Cheap but to be expected for the cost.,42184,2
42185,Barely fit can't wear it more than 2 months,42185,2
42186,To small because I can't get my arm in the top.,42186,2
42187,Pants was a bit to big but the top fit perfect.they can improve on the material of the pants.cheap quality of denim.,42187,2
42188,Came early.,42188,2
42188,"Which was the only good thing about it, besides it being pretty.",42188,2
42188,"BUT, what I got, is not what I ordered.",42188,2
42188,Wrong color.,42188,2
42188,And the left eye on the owl is chipped.,42188,2
42189,I bought this for post partum purposes.,42189,2
42189,"Over all,I would not recommend this product.",42189,2
42189,"The band's material is stiff and folds/buckles in areas when being worn, which looks terrible under clothes.",42189,2
42189,"Also, I'm long waists and it does not cover my entire stomach.",42189,2
42189,It's cheaply made.,42189,2
42189,You'd be better off getting spambot an simply wrapping an ace bandage.arubd your waste.,42189,2
42190,"Good material just wayyyyy too big, order smalllllll",42190,2
42191,Didn't expect much considering the price (just part of a costume) but it broke the first time I tried it on and I was being gentle.,42191,2
42192,"I went by the measurements, but a 10 was too big.",42192,2
42192,So I sent back and ordered an 8.,42192,2
42192,Hoping for better results.,42192,2
42192,Ordered an 8 and still way too big around the chest area.,42192,2
42192,Hoping it can be altered.,42192,2
42192,So frustrated.,42192,2
42192,They seem to fit the same no matter what.,42192,2
42192,My daughter should def be in a 10 or 8 at the least and neither fit.,42192,2
42193,CHEAP IRON ON.. PICTURE LOOKS GOOD BUT DECAL VERY CHEAP.. NOT WORTH THE $$$$ SENDING IT BACK,42193,2
42194,The rings were all too large to be midi rings.,42194,2
42194,The gold coloring wore off immediately.,42194,2
42195,This product was way too big and bulky than it looked in the pictures.,42195,2
42196,"This product was way too small, and not what i expected.",42196,2
42197,Nice fabric but sizing way off,42197,2
42198,"I ordered the equivalent size, I'm a size 16, 44DD so ordered the 4X (seriously, I'm big in China), and the fit was horrible.",42198,2
42198,"The bust was way too small, seemed like it would fit a D, the waist fit ok, but the torso was sooo long.",42198,2
42198,The bottom of the suit was hanging down to mid thigh.,42198,2
42198,"The material was super cheap, but then again so was the suit.",42198,2
42198,Sent it back today.,42198,2
42198,You get what you pay for.,42198,2
42199,item is cute but runs very small and not designed for support.,42199,2
42199,material is flimsy.,42199,2
42200,Cheap material,42200,2
42201,"I ordered a large, as I figured it ran small and it does.",42201,2
42201,"Fits like a fitted T, smaller at waist.",42201,2
42201,Feels like it will shrink even if it's hand washed.,42201,2
42201,"Looks deceptive in the photo, as to me it looks more flowy>",42201,2
42202,"It's alright, a little cheaply made but alright.",42202,2
42202,"The bow in the back is small compared to the shirt, and is just sewed onto the shirt, not wrap around from the inside.",42202,2
42203,"Fabric is unpleasant, front side to high.",42203,2
42204,It's ok.,42204,2
42204,Runs small and not to comfy,42204,2
42205,"I didn't like the material, and the color is more brick red than wine.",42205,2
42206,First the color-Very deceptive.,42206,2
42206,The coat actually arrived as a Chocolate Brown.,42206,2
42206,I ordered 1 size down & the fit was ok.,42206,2
42206,The coat is actually well made and heavy but the color was a bad omen.,42206,2
42206,"I wondered why they showed a honey color when, in fact, it is much darker.",42206,2
42206,The reason is that the dark color doesn't really work as well with this jacket; it looks frumpy---like a $600.,42206,2
42206,welders coat with pockets.,42206,2
42206,I waited a long time to buy this coat & now my disappointment runs deep.,42206,2
42206,Yes.,42206,2
42206,The photo of the coat is enticing but upon delivery all you get is a bait and switch.,42206,2
42207,I really wanted to like this.,42207,2
42207,"It fit ok, it looks great and was my style, (the black one) but it's pretty much see through.",42207,2
42207,"It would be ok if you wear tight under it, but I don't want to.",42207,2
42207,I will return it.,42207,2
42208,very unusual back some straps were too tight and some straps were too loose.,42208,2
42209,"The material is fine, but disappointed as there is stain on it.",42209,2
42210,Picture wasn't very well defined,42210,2
42211,Very sick stiff material.,42211,2
42211,The neck feels too tight.,42211,2
42211,The size was way too big.,42211,2
42212,After reading the reviews I did order a size larger but the item was still too small.,42212,2
42213,The material is very thin and the dress bunches up.,42213,2
42213,"I followed the recommended size chart, but the dress is too small and the arms are too loose.",42213,2
42214,These look so fake!,42214,2
42214,The only reason I gave 2 stars was because they lasted a couple days longer than I expected them to.,42214,2
42215,The shirt I ordered was 2 sizes bigger than what I am and it was still waayyy to small.,42215,2
42215,Ended up giving it to a friend because it didn't fit.,42215,2
42215,Disappointed once again.,42215,2
42215,But the pattern was adorable so that's a plus.,42215,2
42216,Not slouchy.,42216,2
42217,Returned.,42217,2
42217,Liked the color but was too big and terribly unflattering hemline accentuating hips.,42217,2
42218,They are super soft and fit extremely well.,42218,2
42218,My only concern is their quality.,42218,2
42218,After one day of having them on my son the leggings started to split a little and there are threads pulled where the fabric was weaved together.,42218,2
42218,I am hopeing they all do not do this...,42218,2
42218,"Updated after washing
They shrink to half the size!!",42218,2
42218,"It won't stay up on his thigh any more, it rolls down exposing half of his leg.",42218,2
42218,Seriously upset at this point.,42218,2
42218,"Washed in cold water on delicate cycle with the rest of his baby clothes, pulled them out to dry flat.",42218,2
42219,Shorts were cute but the shirt's bow fell off after first time wearing.,42219,2
42219,We used it for birthday party invitation photos so it did it's job and looked cute but cheaply made for sure!,42219,2
42219,!,42219,2
42220,"Gloves were thin and not as warm as we would like, got them for my son for sking, returned these and we ordered a different pair from you, hoping they are warmer",42220,2
42221,Nice sweatpants but very disappointed as there is no drawstring.,42221,2
42221,Had to come home and change because they don't stay up!,42221,2
42221,Will not purchase again because of that.,42221,2
42222,"way small and crap material, one sleeve ripped off when trying on.",42222,2
42222,Returned,42222,2
42223,"cheaply made, completely seethrough, looks nothing like the picture.",42223,2
42223,i don't trust this product and don't plan on using it because it looks like it could rip at any time.,42223,2
42223,the onlt thing i found good was the size.,42223,2
42223,"fit nicely (i'm 5'3, 128lb's).",42223,2
42223,its a little below my ankles but not long enought to step on it.,42223,2
42224,"Much smaller than average, cheap materials",42224,2
42225,Product too small.,42225,2
42225,I did not see a conversion size chart before ordering.,42225,2
42225,Will send back for different size.,42225,2
42226,It's not white!,42226,2
42226,"If you want a top to go with something else that is white, don't buy this.",42226,2
42226,It's more of a ivory color then white.,42226,2
42226,It's cute but not what I wanted.,42226,2
42227,"Absolutely huge and I wouldn't even call this a mini dress as it is almost to my knees (I'm 5'5"")",42227,2
42228,This runs VERY small.,42228,2
42228,Supposed to fit 3-14 months.,42228,2
42228,"Would probably have fit my small to average baby at 3 months, but I ordered it at 5 months and it does not fit her.",42228,2
42229,This doesn't fit well around the boob area.,42229,2
42229,It's too big.,42229,2
42229,I was very disappointed.,42229,2
42230,"First, the top of this shirt is not white as picture, it is a cream color.",42230,2
42230,"Second, it is pretty see through, which is okay.",42230,2
42230,"Third, the ""batwing"" style is huge on this top.",42230,2
42231,I love this hat because it matches the swim bottoms but it is very floppy and gets in my daughter's face.,42231,2
42231,Especially when wet!!,42231,2
42231,!,42231,2
42232,This top fit as expected.,42232,2
42232,"However, it's so thin and flimsy one needs a shirt for this shirt.",42232,2
42233,The sewing wasn't great.,42233,2
42233,"It tore in two locations, the cuff and bottom of the zipper.",42233,2
42233,"Also, the cuffs weren't long enough.",42233,2
42234,Bottoms are much smaller then the top.,42234,2
42234,"Normally I get a small or medium, but I got a large and thrusts tiny",42234,2
42235,Hem is all over the place,42235,2
42236,These things are comically small.,42236,2
42236,I ordered them bigger than my waist because of reviews and they were still too small.,42236,2
42236,"Plus I'm tall, these do not go high enough on the waist to cover the area.",42236,2
42236,These are not suitable for public use.,42236,2
42237,"I loved the quality, and look of it,  however it was too small for my wrist...",42237,2
42238,I bought this hat for my 2.5 yrs.,42238,2
42238,It's quite wide so provided plenty of sun protection almost extending to his shoulders.,42238,2
42238,It was not hot enough for him to start sweating and overall the kids liked it.,42238,2
42238,"But then I had to wash it (following the label recommendations: wash cold, no tumble dry) and it became completely useless because the hat's brim folds around the crown so not only provides less protection but, worse, covers the eyes/face.",42238,2
42238,"Buying a hat that can only be used once, until you wash it, makes it completely useless.",42238,2
42238,Let me know if there's any trick to make the brim stiff again so I can keep using it.,42238,2
42239,The divots in the ball are so shallow it makes it very hard to get and keep lined up for enough tension to keep it in place.,42239,2
42240,This extra small dress is completely sheer and see through.,42240,2
42240,Its fine if you need a bathing suit cover-up on a yacht.... but not a nice yacht.,42240,2
42241,Not wide enough.,42241,2
42242,TO LOOSE,42242,2
42243,They definetly were not the camo- colored sunglasses I purchased as seen in the picture .,42243,2
42244,I was disappointed with this product.,42244,2
42244,It's cute but find it very tight in the arms.,42244,2
42244,I'm not over weight at all and found that arms are to tight to wear anything under.,42244,2
42244,Too bad because it is cute.,42244,2
42245,"The pockets and ears were on backwards, and it doesn't stay closed very well.",42245,2
42245,"It's a nice material, and very warm, though, which is the only reason I gave it two stars.",42245,2
42246,Cheap material but... the price ... it's expected,42246,2
42247,Item was so lightweight I thought  it was the wrong address.,42247,2
42247,"I understand it was not wool, but its this sleaziest  idem I
ve  ever received  from Amazon.",42247,2
42247,Illustration appread to be long jacket as I endered in search.,42247,2
42247,Item has extended panels in front that went out so style.,42247,2
42248,"it is not even a crop top, its definitely like a bra top
also the sleeves don't fit like the picture shown",42248,2
42249,very tiny bands-,42249,2
42250,"The shirt is cute, just not on me.",42250,2
42250,It looked better on the model.,42250,2
42250,It makes me feel frumpy.,42250,2
42250,It needs to be taken in and given a little more shape.,42250,2
42251,"Beautiful earrings, this is my second time purchasing them.",42251,2
42251,The clasps don't last long and they aren't secured to your ears.,42251,2
42251,Loose them easily or the secure locks break and they end up useless,42251,2
42252,Size 8 fits a size 12 person.,42252,2
42253,"This necklace is really cute, and the price was wonderful.",42253,2
42253,Unfortunately with the chains being connected it gets tangled all the time.,42253,2
42253,I wouldn't buy it again.,42253,2
42254,"Big Man Alert:  The body of the shirt fits ok, but the arms are for a small person.",42254,2

42254,!,42254,2
42255,Legs not hemmed.,42255,2
42256,"Somewhat disappointed, misleading size chart.",42256,2
42256,"Usually I wear size S (for reference, I'm 5'3"" and 110lbs), but I went by the size chart and ordered Medium.",42256,2
42256,"Rather than relaxed and flowy, it's just big and boxy.",42256,2
42256,"Material is okay, and the blue is nice.",42256,2
42257,Loved the picture!,42257,2
42257,"Unfortunately I ordered a size large and when I put it on it only covered about 1/3 of my butt, I am 6'.",42257,2
42258,Not as pictured,42258,2
42259,"It was way too short in the torso area for me, would be very cute on the right body type.",42259,2
42259,I'm 5'11 and can rarely make a 1 piece work for me.,42259,2
42260,"Even though I can wear it and it fits, it's not the fit I thought it would be.",42260,2
42260,"It appears to be more of a tunic, but it is a shorter top.",42260,2
42261,"bought for my husband, he finds them a little difficult to pull on and off, they are a little snug for the size range.",42261,2
42261,"He wears a size 10-10.5 shoe, and this is definitely at the top end.",42261,2
42261,"I probably will not order this style again, although he has a similar set in black that fit perfectly fine.",42261,2
42261,It was a little disappointing.,42261,2
42261,And they do seem to be wearing out quicker than the other set of Fila socks he has,42261,2
42262,The material was rather thin and flimsy and it cost way too much.,42262,2
42262,"I returned it and I think I got a refund, although I'm not totally sure at this point.",42262,2
42262,The shipping charges were really high as well.,42262,2
42262,I would suggest you stay away from this product and the Boeing Store in general.,42262,2
42263,The design is nothing like what is pictured!,42263,2
42263,"Ordered a white, which I was unable to see through the photos provided and the whole dress was white with no color distinction like the picture.",42263,2
42263,Disappointed!,42263,2
42264,Poorly made.,42264,2
42264,It looks Like second quality.,42264,2
42264,Bad stitching.,42264,2
42265,This is not a maternity slip.,42265,2
42265,"There's not room for growth, and especially no room for the baby bump.",42265,2
42265,I have no clue why it says maternity when it quite honestly isn't,42265,2
42266,Too big,42266,2
42267,Way too small.,42267,2
42267,Usually wear a medium got an xl just incase.,42267,2
42267,"Fit like a small, not flattering and looks diffrent from the photo.",42267,2
42267,"Unless your super skinny and have a small bust, I wouldn't consider this",42267,2
42268,The bracelet is beautiful but it is huge!!!,42268,2
42268,No way I can wear it!,42268,2
42268,The size should be mentioned in the description!,42268,2
42269,Good,42269,2
42270,Shrinks in wash.  Large really ends up being a medium.,42270,2
42270,Buy a size larger.,42270,2
42270,Design on shirt flakes off very easy.,42270,2
42270,"I was hoping to wear shirt a little more often than just 'once in awhile,'  but it looks like I'll just wear for concerts.",42270,2
42270,"Sharp, but fades way too fast after washing.",42270,2
42271,"I order a size larger than what I normally wear and it still fits tight, and not loose like the picture.",42271,2
42271,It's also very short in the back,42271,2
42272,I had high hopes for this dress but unfortunately it fits like a burlap sack and is very very see through or I'd post a picture to show the poor fit.,42272,2
42273,The bathing suit I received was not this one .,42273,2
42274,"Material is thinner than what you might expect, and way smaller than you would expect.",42274,2
42275,Somewhat a little large.,42275,2
42275,She'll be able to wear next year,42275,2
42276,These are not tights.,42276,2
42276,"These are more like sweatpants material, very thick, but cut into a tights shape.",42276,2
42277,not worth it.,42277,2
42278,It doesn't fit right .,42278,2
42278,Too tight in some places and too bulky in other places.,42278,2
42278,I wouldn't recommend it ...,42278,2
42279,sizes are not US measurements,42279,2
42280,"They were just ""ok""...",42280,2
42281,Fit as expected but it was very uncomfortable and left painful prints.,42281,2
42281,I suggest waist trainer with velcro & no wire.,42281,2
42282,The skirt was too short for my preference and the picture depicts it to be longer than really is.,42282,2
42282,Other than that it's adorable.,42282,2
42283,Can't even write with these.,42283,2
42283,They are cute but unusable,42283,2
42284,"Barely covers your nipples, runs quite small!",42284,2
42285,"Leather started to peel quickly, falling apart.",42285,2
42285,"The belt also began to bow outward, and the buckle at times is hard to undo.",42285,2
42286,"beautiful, but it broke after 2 uses--I question the quality, but the style is fabulous",42286,2
42287,Dark red not the red you show.,42287,2
42287,Way larger then I expected.,42287,2
42288,The fit was weird - returned,42288,2
42289,It was not what I expected.,42289,2
42289,It looks better on the model then in real life.,42289,2
42289,"I am 5''4' and about 140lbs, I got a size medium.",42289,2
42289,I probably should have gotten a large size.,42289,2
42289,Maybe it would have looked better on me in a large but I just did not like the material.,42289,2
42289,I will be returning it because it just didn't look good on me.,42289,2
42290,Disappointed,42290,2
42291,I won't buy them again.,42291,2
42291,The quality was bad,42291,2
42292,It's was right every where but the chest.,42292,2
42292,If you have breasts think about going big.,42292,2
42292,"Also, they say easy return but you have to pay the shipping.",42292,2
42292,So shipping to China is almost as much as the coat.,42292,2
42292,Is is a pretty coat but kinda felt feeling.,42292,2
42293,Smaller than expected,42293,2
42294,WAY TOO SMALL - MORE LIKE A MEDOUM THAN AN XL,42294,2
42295,earrings are difficult to put on and do not stay on properly,42295,2
42296,Not true to size,42296,2
42297,Too floppy.,42297,2
42297,This is a very flexible lace.,42297,2
42297,The tall side doesn't stay up.,42297,2
42298,"I loved the way this looked in the picture, the fit was awesome, nice quality, however the fabric sagged in the front and back covering the ruffle.",42298,2
42298,"Maybe that's how it is suppose to be, but I found it to be very unattractive.",42298,2
42298,I'm returning it and searching for something different.,42298,2
42299,This hat is HUGE.,42299,2
42299,I'm 27 and it fits me.,42299,2
42299,The photo is my 10lb.,42299,2

42304,"Its not a dress, it is however a beautiful shirt..I ordered it 2 sizes up usually I wear a medium but I got an xL and it was still to small..",42304,2
42305,Beautiful dress.,42305,2
42305,Some Jewels fell out and shipping but will be easy to repair.,42305,2
42305,Belts on dress was not like seen in picture and the placement of the pattern of jewels was a little off.,42305,2
42306,Way too small I didn't like it.,42306,2
42306,It didn't even fit on my arms pitiful how they deceive you on the picture making it look big please it's really small,42306,2
42307,No very sturdy.,42307,2
42307,It breaks very easily.,42307,2
42308,I had such high hopes for this romper and I was so sad when I returned it.,42308,2
42308,The print is cute but the fit was way off!,42308,2
42308,It looked very bulky and boxy on me and the crotch area was much lower than expected.,42308,2
42309,This was very small.,42309,2
42310,"If I had known the stitches would be so itchy, I would have never bought it.",42310,2
42310,Size was pretty good and it looks cute enough but after only wearing it for 5 minutes I had to take it off.,42310,2
42311,"Heed the warnings on other reviews, these shorts fit extremely small, I bought 2 sizes bigger than normal and they are still tight on me.",42311,2
42312,The top was OK!!,42312,2
42312,But the bottoms were extremely Large!,42312,2
42312,Other then that great material not see through.,42312,2
42313,Small,42313,2
42314,Hand to  number off  alignment,42314,2
42315,Was expecting the fit on my legs not to b so tight and top portion to extend further up.,42315,2
42316,Size is not at all a large.,42316,2
42316,Title says it all,42316,2
42317,This sweater is sized very small.,42317,2
42317,"If you like a more relaxed/regular fit, it's best to get 3 sizes larger than what you'd usually buy.",42317,2
42317,"The fabric is soft, but not stretchy.",42317,2
42318,The knot on the rubber band is visible making it look really cheap,42318,2
42319,Need to be able to adjust waist.,42319,2
42319,I had to return,42319,2
42320,"After a couple months, the metal turned gross.",42320,2
42320,I don't think this is titanium.. or at least it doesn't have the same quality as my other belly button ring.,42320,2
42321,The skirt is see through!,42321,2
42321,!,42321,2
42322,Lovely.,42322,2

42324,Had to give to my daughter who is a size 2.,42324,2
42324,This runs very small,42324,2
42325,"It's a nice jumper, but I definitely thought it was gonna be different to how it turned out",42325,2
42326,Not impressed.,42326,2
42326,Co Stanton had to mess with it to fix it to stay in place.,42326,2
42326,Cute design but I wouldn't purchase one again.,42326,2
42327,Didn't stay on.,42327,2
42328,"Printed very poorly , splats of ink everywhere",42328,2
42329,"While attractive, this evening purse does not function.",42329,2
42329,"Though they promote the purse as accommodating an iPhone, one cannot insert the iPhone (and I have the smaller iPhone 6) and still close the purse.",42329,2
42329,"If you place one credit card sized room key, two tissues and one lipstick, the purse will close but then it will not open!",42329,2
42329,So the items are in there but the purse is locked!,42329,2
42329,Forcing it open risks damaging the purse.,42329,2
42329,"Furthermore, the ""attached"" skinny metal shoulder strap broke off.",42329,2
42330,Stretches out easily.,42330,2
42330,They don't look as nice as in the picture and are closer to fishnet than lace.,42330,2
42330,Pretty cheaply made.,42330,2
42330,Seam runs down the center of the crotch and gives bad camel toe.,42330,2
42330,"However, for the price...these might be great for just a night out.",42330,2
42330,"Just don't expect to be able to wear them out, for a full day at work.",42330,2
42331,My size is a XL but when I wore it it felt like a medium.,42331,2
42331,It was really tight and hard to put on.,42331,2
42332,Looks and feels cheap.,42332,2
42332,Too big and does not stay in place.,42332,2
42332,Was looking for fashionable eyewear but the only thing  these glasses are good for is Halloween.,42332,2
42333,Too Short and the fabric wasn't lined so you could see the underside of the white on the arm sleeves.,42333,2
42333,Looked cheap because of that.,42333,2
42333,"I'm a little under 5'3"" and, even in flats, it was high water length.",42333,2
42334,Very cute and was excited for it arrive but it didn't fit my chest.,42334,2
42334,Ordered a large but the built in bra is more for medium.,42334,2
42335,didn't like the way it fit,42335,2
42336,I gave it 2 stars because it is pretty.,42336,2
42336,I am size 6-8 and 5'1 and this fits like a very tight tunic and I ordered a large.,42336,2
42336,Very disappointing because O really liked it.,42336,2
42337,"Poor quality, weird material",42337,2
42338,"REALLY too tight and since this is a shirt for women prepare to ALWAYS wear a bra or be an unintentional flasher (something i found out thankfully when husband and i were still in car lol), (Im small busted so no bra needed (this is obviously posters wife lol), but still doesn't mean I want to give total strangers a free peep show..even tho it looks like it sits nice on the model the neck is too long so it hangs low and then the armholes are bigger than they appear hence your boobs decide to make a break for it.",42338,2
42338,It IS cute tho,42338,2
42339,top was huge and bottoms too small,42339,2
42340,Too small,42340,2
42341,I would never buy this bag again.,42341,2
42341,The purse itself was flimsy & made with cheap material.,42341,2
42341,"The stitching was fine, but I know it would never be able to hold any kind of weight.",42341,2
42341,"It might work well as a bag for a little girl since they don't carry much, but not a grown woman.",42341,2
42341,My biggest issue with this purse is the horribly foul smell it has.,42341,2
42341,It is really bad.,42341,2
42341,"I have had it sitting in the garage hoping the smell will dissipate, but so far that's not been my experience.",42341,2
42341,After 2 weeks I still can't bring it in the house.,42341,2
42341,Hopefully it'll be fine by Christmas so I can give it to a friend's daughter.,42341,2
42341,That's a doable thing considering Christmas is three and a half months away.,42341,2
42341,Overall I give this purse two stars.,42341,2
42341,It does look the way it was advertised.,42341,2
42341,For that I don't take issue.,42341,2
42341,If the purse where usable I would have ranked it higher,42341,2
42342,Had to buy more stockings.,42342,2
42342,Should be size fits small.,42342,2
42343,"Top fits ok, but the bottoms were not only tight they are too sheer and see through!",42343,2
42343,Ordered the orange with pink bottoms.,42343,2
42343,Extremely disappointed in the bottoms.,42343,2
42343,Wish these could be ordered in seperstr size tops and bottoms.,42343,2
42344,Cheaply made.,42344,2
42345,"cute but it wasn't a ""hoodie"" it was a thin shirt w a hood also it was quite small",42345,2
42346,"Too big, but it looks well made.",42346,2
42347,"I read several reviews about these panties running small, but I took a chance on them because other reviewers said that they would fit size 5-7.",42347,2
42347,"I typically wear a 6 or 7, but these were too small for my taste and the lace kept rolling up around the hips and digging in.",42347,2
42347,I also found the quality is inconsistent across the colors.,42347,2
42347,"I washed them in a hosiery bag on the delicate cycle of my steam washer and line dried like other brands, but the white ones began to fray after only two washings.",42347,2
42347,The darker colors washed nicely.,42347,2
42347,I liked the wider fit in the back as they didn't ride up like similar panties that I've tried.,42347,2
42348,Didn't like it....Ill just do 78924946923964239 squats instead.,42348,2
42349,Something wrong with lekalas or sewing patterns.,42349,2
42349,I don't feel comfortable my hands in the mittens.,42349,2
42349,"They without doubt are warm, but it's hard to make a fist with hands in them.",42349,2
42350,This looks cheap and isn't cut well.,42350,2
42350,the waist hits in a very awkward spot.,42350,2
42350,The pattern is pretty on the bottom but I will need to return it.,42350,2
42351,Cheap polyester fabric.,42351,2
42351,Not at all chiffon-like.,42351,2
42352,not to happy over al look of beads,42352,2
42353,to big,42353,2
42354,"Not as pictured, very short ankle.",42354,2
42355,Too large for petite people,42355,2
42356,"I really want to like these shorts, but ...  Stitching not finished on bottom of right front pocket, so all change has a straight shot to the floor.",42356,2
42356,Poor quality control.,42356,2
42356,"Wife will fix, but it seems others have had QC problems also, after reading the reviews.",42356,2
42356,"Fit is OK - a bit tight, but could be just me - no, other shorts and jeans fit better.",42356,2
42356,These are just a tad tight.,42356,2
42356,I also noticed that there are two fewer belt loops - one each side over the hips.,42356,2
42356,"Since I frequently carry a camera on my belt, this is not good.",42356,2
42356,Rear pocket snaps difficult to fasten.,42356,2
42356,"Oh, well.",42356,2
42356,"Style is fine, quality - not so much  I suggest trying a different brand.",42356,2
42357,It's bigger than you think,42357,2
42358,It was cute but started to shred and fall apart after 2 uses,42358,2
42359,The product is beautiful.,42359,2
42359,The problem was that when it arrived it SMELLED/STUNK like mold or sewer.,42359,2
42359,My husband didn't even bring it inside.,42359,2
42359,"He tried to let it air out in the garage, but the smell was so bad no one wanted to get out of our vehicles in the garage and come inside through the garage.",42359,2
42359,"My husband ended up putting it in a sealed coffee can, and it has been there since November (it is now later February).",42359,2
42359,Has anyone else had this happen?,42359,2
42360,Thin material,42360,2
42361,Wasn't as pictured.,42361,2
42361,Neck of dress reminded me of the cheap holloween costumes you get as a kid.,42361,2
42361,Held together by elastic and the cut in the back of neck is 1 inch max not like what is shown in the picture.,42361,2
42362,"Love the dress, but it's not true to size.",42362,2
42362,Ordered a medium because that what I normally wear.,42362,2
42362,It was too small,42362,2
42363,I wear size 7 in women's shoes and these socks keep falling off the back of my feet.,42363,2
42363,Would I buy it again?,42363,2
42363,No.,42363,2
42364,"Everything came in time and it had all the items it specified, but it was advertised as a Plus size and when I got it that was obviously not the case.",42364,2
42365,Incredibly cheap product.,42365,2
42365,"Had it for a few days and pieces have started to come off, even with careful play.",42365,2
42366,I ordered an EXTRA small and it was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!,42366,2
42366,!,42366,2
42367,"All of these bags looked very promising when I first saw them, however, the quality is not very good in my opinion and does not meet the expectations I had in mind.",42367,2
42368,It's just doesn't fit the pocket too well.,42368,2
42368,Almost looks like a small women's purse.,42368,2
42369,My daughter does love the design and we are keeping it but it was much thinner than I had expected- feels like it will tear especially near the buttons!,42369,2
42369,"Luckily since it's not something she will wear daily, I'm hoping it will last a few months!",42369,2
42370,This product does not look at all like the picture,42370,2
42371,Way too tiny and I got the largest option.,42371,2
42371,Otherwise it was really cute.,42371,2
42371,:(,42371,2
42372,I like the colors but this too is rather picky from the wire it is made with!,42372,2
42373,Not what I expected it to be.,42373,2
42373,This outfit is cute but it is a bit see through so I am going to have a lining added to the shorts and wear a nude bra for the crop top.,42373,2
42373,I read other reviews to go a size or two up but it was still slightly small.,42373,2
42373,When I recieced the package there was an odor but nothing like a good wash can fix.,42373,2
42373,Was disappointed with the color of the shorts cuz I though it was like a light beige but this was more towards a light soft pinkish coral.,42373,2
42373,This did arrive sooner then expected so that was a positive.,42373,2
42374,It's a very nice top.,42374,2
42374,But runs very small.,42374,2
42374,I am usually a large so I ordered a large and XL but neither fit.,42374,2
42374,Sent them both back.,42374,2
42375,Looks fairly cheap.,42375,2
42375,"Not sure, I will wear it.",42375,2
42375,The crystal drops are plastic.,42375,2
42376,Kinda flimsy.,42376,2
42376,"Dried glue hanging from side lazers, handle pretty large for my 11 year old to hold.",42376,2
42377,It was return,42377,2

42378,Size 20 delivered.,42378,2

42379,I had to return it same day item arrived.,42379,2
42379,Very disappointed,42379,2
42380,"I'm going to start by saying that based on the ring itself, and very cute packaging, this WOULD have been a five star rating if they had ONLY been less... misleading.",42380,2
42380,"This is a gorgeous piece of costume jewelry and the amount of labor required to cast and plate the body (yes- PLATE- I will get to that), and cut and set the stones, is worth quite a bit more than twenty bucks.",42380,2
42380,"""Topaz simulated diamond 10k gold filled"" with a picture of a blue center stone.",42380,2
42380,"Any reasonable person will take that to mean that blue stone is topaz, the side stones are CZ or equivalent, and the body is solid low-karat white gold.",42380,2
42380,"The center stone MAY in fact be topaz; I am not qualified to call that one, but it certainly isn't the color shown in the pictures.",42380,2
42380,"It is very nicely cut for a piece in this price range, and shows some color refraction in daylight.",42380,2
42380,"The side stones are for the most part perfectly acceptable, but two that are set in the crown actually have a golden color that once I noticed it, I see at a glance.",42380,2
42380,Again... TWENTY BUCKS.,42380,2
42380,I'm not heartbroken.,42380,2
42380,Here's why I'm so annoyed.,42380,2
42380,Why can't some Amazon sellers just be honest and say exactly what it is we are buying?,42380,2
42380,The ad makes it sound like solid cheap white gold.,42380,2
42380,"It has a stamp inside the band that says ""10K"" very clearly.",42380,2
42380,"A stamp like that should never, but often does, appear on items with a base metal center.",42380,2
42380,"The seller responded to a question by saying 'it's white copper', which is commonly referred to as cupronickel, It's an ideal material for coins and silverware and certainly finds its way into plenty of costume jewellery.",42380,2
42380,That would have been a reasonable material to make a ring like this out of.,42380,2
42380,I did a quick test on the inside of the ring using a drop of high concentration Nitric acid.,42380,2
42380,"If the material were cupronickel, it would have fizzed and turned greenish blue.",42380,2
42380,NOTHING.,42380,2
42380,"Well color me surprised, this ring is in fact gold plated.",42380,2
42380,"I scratched through the plating on the inside, having by now decided not to return it because it's so nice looking, and the center is also not 'white copper'.",42380,2
42380,It's plain red copper.,42380,2
42380,A nitric acid test fizzed up and the second picture is of the blue color on a lab wipe.,42380,2
42380,"They could have used cupronickel inside, which would have been better as the plating wore off so as not to be so obvious.",42380,2
42380,NEVER wear this ring to the beach or in any environment where it will be exposed to abrasives.,42380,2
42380,"My last complaint is that I attempted to cancel my order 20 minutes after placing it, and got a message TWO DAYS LATER that it was being shipped.",42380,2
42380,Really?!,42380,2
42380,Okay now for the good stuff.,42380,2
42380,I ordered this ring to wear with my stainless Invicta watch and the styles complement each other well.,42380,2
42380,The ring is bright and looks and feels much more solid than your average costume jewellery.,42380,2
42380,"It IS extremely well put together, even if the material description is questionable.",42380,2
42380,"I have a stainless steel ring on order to wear to work, since this one DEFINITELY won't last long at a machine shop, but it will be a fabulous weekend ring.",42380,2
42381,"They look exactly like the pictures only thing is it is SUPER HARD to screw the other have on..you turn it clockwise to close and opposite to open, it took me at least 20-30 mins to try get it in.",42381,2
42382,Itsy bitsy teeny weeny ... Too.,42382,2
42382,Bottoms are cute thought it was seen upside down (the top) I love the buttons though.,42382,2
42382,If your anything over a 34b (I'm 36dd) this isn't the bikini for you,42382,2
42383,Cheap material.,42383,2
42383,I never wore it.,42383,2
42384,I have the Saxx Kinetic underwear and I love them.,42384,2
42384,I tried these out to see which style I would like better and just seconds after walking in these I had to keep pulling it out of my rear.,42384,2
42384,The size felt perfect compared to all other boxers but for some reason this style doesn't agree with my anatomy.,42384,2
42385,One of the discs fell off the first week I got these.,42385,2
42385,"Thankfully, I was able to reattach.",42385,2
42385,:(,42385,2
42386,It's small and I knew it would be fake silk but it looks like a kids costume like doc mcstuffins jacket,42386,2
42387,XXXL fit like a Tight US Med,42387,2
42388,I really hated the materials is was made from.,42388,2
42388,very thing craft foam and cheap paint.,42388,2
42388,I would only get this if I was planning on going to a Halloween drinking party and planned on it getting destroyed.,42388,2
42388,Though it fits fine and isn't really uncomfortable.,42388,2
42389,"VERY uncomfortable, but def gives you a full chest",42389,2
42390,super small,42390,2
42391,The description is not accurate I can't get anyone to contact me back.,42391,2
42391,I order a XL because of the description it goes below my knees looks like a dress I need a medium and can't get anyone to contact me back.,42391,2
42391,So disappointed,42391,2
42392,fits ok..but the lining just cut into the foot and at the end of the day a lot less comfortable than other no-show socks ive bought.,42392,2
42392,"asked for replacement twice, size up to see if it would help, said twice they would send it in the mail but never came.",42392,2
42392,"had high hopes, will update review if anything changes.",42392,2
42393,Not what I expected.,42393,2
42393,See through material and runs very small,42393,2
42394,I got the largest size hoping it would look like it does on the model in the picture.,42394,2
42394,"However, it's just a normal looking and fiting sweater.",42394,2
42394,I'm 5'3 122lbs if that helps.,42394,2
42394,Kudos to being very soft and fluffy though.,42394,2
42395,Smaller than expected and thin material.,42395,2
42395,I did not love the red in it.,42395,2
42395,I wanted more pink.,42395,2
42396,"Wobbles, every time I try to pick up one thing, I knock down a couple of others.",42396,2
42397,What I received didn't completely match the picture..,42397,2
42397,"The pants had zippers on either hip instead of one down the back, waistband was elastic and didn't fall flat.",42397,2
42397,There were also triangular shaped cut outs on the front hem of the pants.,42397,2
42397,"No pocket on the bib, either.",42397,2
42397,"Straps have buttonholes and affix near the zippers on each hip, you can do them normally or cross them across your back.",42397,2
42397,"The fit was fine, material is a little bit stretchy.",42397,2
42397,"I wanted to love them, but the cinchy waistband and cut of the pants just didn't work for me.",42397,2
42397,They also don't have that comfy wear-all-the-time vibe like overalls should have.,42397,2
42397,They were kind of formal feeling.,42397,2
42398,"Too large to wear in public, but very comfortable to wear around the house",42398,2
42399,The tan is very orange.,42399,2
42399,It also has a funny smell.,42399,2
42400,Very tight fitting almost tore trying to put it on.,42400,2
42400,Don't care much for it.,42400,2
42401,The size 4 is too large.,42401,2
42401,Material and stitching appears good.,42401,2
42402,Sizes need to be consistent or note how they compare with American sizes if they intend to sell here.,42402,2
42403,Cheap quality.. it had a rip in it,42403,2
42404,Does not look as good as it on the picture...,42404,2
42405,Fabric feels cheap.,42405,2
42405,Fits strange around my shoulders.,42405,2
42406,"Heel slips, for me at least.",42406,2
42406,"Game breaker if the sock fits, but won't stay where it belongs.",42406,2
42407,"poor leather quality, doesn't match the price.",42407,2
42408,The bracelet is really cute however clasp and and chain are very cheap and break easily.,42408,2
42408,I finally purchased at craft store a replacement chain and clasp and it's good.,42408,2
42409,Should of brought this in a smaller size.. Oh well better big than to small..I can make it work.,42409,2
42410,I did not like the quality and the pants did not have a front or back and only one pocket.,42410,2
42410,I found other products that were less expensive and the fabrics were nice and softer.,42410,2
42411,Fragile frame and not polarized,42411,2
42412,I was really looking forward to wearing these but the flares are too big so I can't put them in.,42412,2
42412,Other then not being able to wear them I like them.,42412,2
42413,Lights don't work!!,42413,2
42413,Tried everything any suggrstions,42413,2
42414,"Did not fit, sizing is way off.",42414,2
42414,This is so often the case when buying direct from overseas.,42414,2
42415,"Missing one bow
And they stick with silicone",42415,2
42416,"Nope,",42416,2
42417,"When I received this vest, I expected a more structured fabric to support the structured cut of the garment, especially since it is unlined.",42417,2
42417,"Sadly, the fabric is a bit more fluid than it needs to be and doesn't provide enough body to support the structure of the vest.",42417,2
42417,It hung poorly resulting in a very unflattering silhouette.,42417,2
42417,"The lapels did not lay flat, and the facing of the lapels was constantly unfolding in the most unflattering way.",42417,2
42417,I returned the garment.,42417,2
42418,"The shirt is very short, very see through, has an awkward cut.",42418,2
42419,runs very small.,42419,2
42419,I had to give it a friend.,42419,2
42420,"I realize these aren't expensive sunglasses, but they feel super cheap and rattle-y.",42420,2
42420,"They came with a pretty nice case, a cleaning cloth, and a little glasses repair screwdriver.",42420,2
42420,I'd rather they had skipped all that and just put a little more quality into the glasses.,42420,2
42420,"That being said, they were really pretty (I got the blue ones) and I might have kept them except they were way too big for my face.",42420,2
42420,Sorry to say these were a miss for me.,42420,2
42421,Falling apart after only 2 weeks of minimal use.,42421,2
42422,It was cute enough but WAY to small I normally wear a large ordered this in xl and ended up giving it to my mom who comfortably wears a medium,42422,2
42423,Love the designs.,42423,2
42423,"It is a bit small, though.",42423,2
42423,"I used to have a much larger, trifold wallet.",42423,2
42423,"Also, the coins in the little change pocket sometimes block cards from going down in the front card slot.",42423,2
42423,"This would make a great wallet for a child or teenager, not a grown man with the same interests as a child or teenager.",42423,2
42423,Update: Wallet didn't last long.,42423,2
42423,Fell apart in no time flat.,42423,2
42423,Had to go out and buy a new one.,42423,2
42424,"definately smaller than expected, the color and finish look cheap",42424,2
42425,"the hat arrive fits as expected, it had the tags but the cap itself looks dirty like if it was once a returned (poor quality).",42425,2
42426,I like the studs but when I received it I was missing a pair :( wish I could get it replaced?,42426,2
42427,Pretty but very bad design the rock does not stay put in the metal.,42427,2
42428,Pay for what you get.,42428,2
42429,"I am typically a size large, and am 5'3"" tall.",42429,2
42429,"I bought this for a Halloween costume so it wasn't a big deal for me, but it didn't fit great.",42429,2
42429,It was shorter than expected (especially in the back) and didn't even wrap all the way around me.,42429,2
42429,Also the sleeves were really puffy.,42429,2
42429,"It was okay, but I was hoping to be able to wear it otherwise, but probably only will for Halloween.",42429,2
42430,Had holes in the pockets and rips really easily,42430,2
42431,okay,42431,2
42432,Color completely different!,42432,2
42433,The way the fabric sits on the body is strange and uncomfortable.,42433,2
42434,Weird shoulders,42434,2
42435,It is cute but in the picture it looked like a 2 piece.,42435,2
42435,Since it is a ine piece it is a bit small.,42435,2
42435,And mine came ripped in the bra area.,42435,2
42436,"It was too wide for my husband's finger, making it awkward and uncomfortable for him to wear.",42436,2
42436,:(,42436,2
42437,Doesn't look that great; a child might like it?,42437,2
42438,Very strange cut.,42438,2
42438,It sits really low on the chest.,42438,2
42438,This would work for those that are extremely short waisted.,42438,2
42438,"Or, for someone that is screaming for attention and wants to show extra extra.....extra skin.",42438,2
42439,It's beautiful to look at but very uncomfortable to wear,42439,2
42440,"I usually wear a size large, but when I saw the reviews about the legs being too short, I ordered a 1x/2x thinking it would surely be long enough.",42440,2
42440,Legs were not long enough and are very uncomfortable.,42440,2
42440,"Buyers, please take heed when we say the legs are too short!",42440,2
42441,Sandals were not comfortable.,42441,2
42441,The color looked different in person than in the picture.,42441,2
42441,More orangey.,42441,2
42442,Not what I had expected it to be,42442,2
42443,You get what you pay for.,42443,2
42443,Top runs very small and is way longer in the back than the front.,42443,2
42443,Bottom sewn to liner making a very unflattering bubble effect.,42443,2
42443,:( On a positive note it arrived earlier than expected.,42443,2
42444,No coments,42444,2
42445,The clip was too big,42445,2
42446,it  so small for  me  but  my  niece could  with  it,42446,2
42447,There's a design on them that makes it look more grey.,42447,2
42447,The socks are black but the design which covers most of it makes it look more grey.,42447,2
42447,Haven't tried them on but might be returning simply bc I was looking for black,42447,2
42448,"The design was wore along the bottom of the jacket, a few of the ""spikes"" on the back were cut a little uneven and it was very small for a 4T.",42448,2
42448,I returned the jacket.,42448,2
42449,"Really wanted to like this one, but I ended up sending it back.",42449,2
42449,"The material, colors and style are all very pretty.",42449,2
42449,"However, the fit is strange.",42449,2
42449,"The suit is incredibly long and it has too much fabric in the upper torso and breast cup area, so that it causes a ""rippled"" effect while wearing.",42449,2
42449,No amount of tightening or adjusting the top straps will fix the problem.,42449,2
42449,"The overall length and bottom of the suit fit fine, so this may be a manufacturing issue.",42449,2
42449,"I am 5'7"" 140 lbs and hourglass shaped with C cup bra for reference.",42449,2
42449,"I did size up to a Large, since I am taller and many of the reviews suggested the suits ran small.",42449,2
42449,"A size small might have fit better in breast, but then you would sacrifice the length and bottom fit.",42449,2
42449,"If you are top heavy and shorter, than maybe the suit will fit better.",42449,2
42450,Size is very small.,42450,2
42451,"I bought this for our 6 month old, who's right in target for her age & the tail blanket was very snug.",42451,2
42451,"Also I'd like to mention that all of the ""pearl"" beads are hit glued on, so a few fell off right out of the package.",42451,2
42451,I will have to fix those by hand sewing them back on.,42451,2
42451,The starfish bra was crushed and unusable :-(,42451,2
42452,WAY TOO SMALL,42452,2
42453,TAKE NOTE: These socks are handwash only!,42453,2
42453,Socks.,42453,2
42453,Handwash.,42453,2
42453,I mean I love my husband and all but not enough to hand wash his socks.,42453,2
42453,"That said, we put them in the washing machine and now they are constantly slipping.",42453,2
42454,Well.,42454,2
42454,It's super cute.,42454,2
42454,But the top strap was entirely too tight; felt like it was digging into my skin.,42454,2
42454,I have a wide upper-body though.,42454,2
42454,If you're petite it'll be perfect.,42454,2
42455,more like knee socks.,42455,2
42455,"they come up to my knee, not over it.",42455,2
42455,Definitely not thigh highs.,42455,2
42456,"I originally wrote a decent review for this bag, as I really enjoy the look and feel of it.",42456,2
42456,"Unfortunately, now, after only two months, the hardware which connect the bag to the messenger strap have broken, from normal wear.",42456,2
42456,Please note the attached photo.,42456,2
42456,"Although I have only included a photo of one clasp, both have broken, rendering the ""messenger"" part of this messenger bag useless.",42456,2
42456,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought the bag for an event, allowing me to easily carry around various items and books that I would acquire; and it worked excellent for the weekend.",42456,2
42456,"Moving forward, I enjoyed the bag and missed the multi purposefulness of a messenger bag, and decided to use it as an everyday bag.",42456,2
42456,"I've used it the last few weeks, and only have one real complaint: I wish the front buckles were heavier, making them more prone to holding down the front flap.",42456,2
42456,"Other than that, it works great!",42456,2
42456,"I like that inner pockets (there basically three separate ones, with the center one having padding - great for a laptop!",42456,2
42456,"As well as an inner zippered pocket, and an outer Zippered pocket as well.",42456,2
42456,"The front pockets are also handy for holding items you want easy access to, but they are deep enough that nothing falls out.",42456,2
42456,I keep a journal on one side and the other is good for keys or a wallet.,42456,2
42457,It will work for a one-time use.,42457,2
42457,The ivory ribbon wrapped around the headband came off on the same day I wore it.,42457,2
42457,It was not attached well at all considering I just went to a tea party and had a lunch.,42457,2
42457,I wasn't doing anything super active for it to have been agitated enough to come unglued.,42457,2
42458,The dress itself was beautiful!,42458,2
42458,Looks just like the picture.,42458,2
42458,The material was very nice.,42458,2
42458,However!!!,42458,2
42458,This dress is just not well made.,42458,2
42458,I am usually a size 8/medium.,42458,2
42458,I bought - twice!,42458,2
42458,"Because the first one was just too small, even though I went up to (size 12).",42458,2
42458,The last size I got was 14 and I gave up.,42458,2
42458,"The boos area (size 36D) , the waist all fit well..",42458,2
42458,But my shoulders???,42458,2
42458,It was just so weird.,42458,2
42458,It was so unfortunate because I really liked the dress itself.,42458,2
42458,I would recommend this dress if you are tall and very thin with no boobs.,42458,2
42459,Mom says cheap and not like photo,42459,2
42460,The shirt fit and was OK quality.,42460,2
42460,There were several lose strings and one of the sleeves was missing the ring to strap it up with.,42460,2
42461,"Sorry, this seemed like a good idea, but didn't work well for me.",42461,2
42461,The leather was good quality as was the workmanship.,42461,2
42461,It was just a bit too large and 'stiff' for my liking.,42461,2
42462,The top is really nice.,42462,2
42462,Sims to be good quality too.,42462,2
42462,Color is the same as on picture.,42462,2
42462,However the size is way too small.,42462,2
42462,"I usually wear mid - large and ordered extra large, because I was aware that the top runs small...but it's way too small.",42462,2
42462,Since I took all the tags off I gave it to my friend.,42462,2
42462,"She is very tiny, hope she will fit into it.",42462,2
42462,They should really change the sizing chart..,42462,2
42463,I love the design on this backpack.,42463,2
42463,The only issues I have are with the zippers.,42463,2
42463,"Within 2 days of using it, the zipper on the front pouch came completely off the track.",42463,2
42463,It broke into several pieces.,42463,2
42463,"Unlike other backpacks, you have to be extremely careful when zipping any zippers on this product.",42463,2
42463,The zipper on the big pouch has almost broken but I was able to salvage it.,42463,2
42463,"Also, it has a very strong unpleasant  smell to it.",42463,2
42463,It is not machine washable  as it ripped a little in my washing machine.,42463,2
42463,"If it weren't such an inconvenience, I'd exchange it.",42463,2
42464,I bought a size36.,42464,2
42464,Fits fine at the waist.,42464,2
42464,Color was not what I thought it would be.,42464,2
42464,A little dingy compared to photo.,42464,2
42464,Feels a little snug for relaxed fit by US standards.,42464,2
42464,Almost feels like I bought a extra lage version of girls shorts.,42464,2
42464,"I can be a little picky sometimes, but I will never wear these.",42464,2
42464,Pockets seem shallow both side pockets and cargo.,42464,2
42464,"Inseam is a little shorter than pictured, but that could also be the model size compared to me.",42464,2
42464,Not a good quality denium feels cheap,42464,2
42465,A lot small...,42465,2
42466,I would have rated this item 4 stars but it looks nothing like the picture.,42466,2
42466,The rudder was tied to the leather cuff in a manner that it's almost hidden.,42466,2
42467,"Bought these thinking they were suede, which is how they were listed.",42467,2
42467,"Most definitely not suede, however, they are still very cute.",42467,2
42467,The color from the picture is also a bit lighter than in person.,42467,2
42467,I ordered the brown ones.,42467,2
42467,"My daughter wears a size 7 normally, but ordered an 8 for room to grow.",42467,2
42467,They are actually in comparison to a toddler size 6.,42467,2
42467,Sadly her foot was hanging out of the back and would not zip.,42467,2
42467,Will have to return,42467,2
42468,Fits small.,42468,2
42468,Cheaply made.,42468,2
42468,Nothing like the picture...even the color was bad.,42468,2
42469,Doesn't fit like it does in picture.,42469,2
42470,This underskirt does not flare out like shown in the pic...no matter how long I try to fluff it out.,42470,2
42470,"There are really only 2 layers, the polyester liner with tulle-like crinoline top skirt.",42470,2
42470,"Parts of it would stick out because the fabric is stiff, but it does not flare out uniformly like the pic.",42470,2
42470,My daughter was dressed as a Victorian princess for Halloween (costume is also sold on Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IGOSGK8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it didn't make the skirt look full at all.,42470,2
42470,"It may work with 2 or 3 layers of the same petticoat, but who wants to put that many layers on a child?",42470,2
42470,I ended up buying a petticoat from Chasing Fireflies and that one worked out very well.,42470,2
42471,I was hoping that this watch would be more stable and reliable compared with my Casio WV-200A which has a nasty habit of resetting itself for the hell of it.,42471,2
42471,"Unfortunately, this wasn't the watch that could beat the Casio.",42471,2
42471,"After a few days of use, the Solar Atomic (which is a private label...you'll find look alikes with the exact design branded by others) started randomly advancing its hour hand by a few hours...sometimes 2 hours, sometimes 3.",42471,2
42471,Then the hour and and second hand would not line up at 12:00 (see photo).,42471,2
42471,"Finally, the thick leather watchband has green rubber coated edges that began to wear off almost immediately (see photo).",42471,2
42471,I'm really disappointed because I need something more stable than the Casio.,42471,2
42471,Sigh.,42471,2
42472,Very small and the rings are unevenly spaced.,42472,2
42473,I did not care for this shirt.,42473,2
42473,I am normally a size extra large in other nursing tank tops.,42473,2
42473,The shirt was extremely tight and uncomfortable.,42473,2
42473,"In the picture, the shirt looked like a very long top.",42473,2
42473,When I tried on the shirt it barely covered my mid drift.,42473,2
42473,I know that sometimes clothes can run small but this was excessively small.,42473,2
42473,This shirt seemed to be of very poor quality and I would not recommend it to others who are above a size small.,42473,2
42473,I will most likely not order from this seller again.,42473,2
42474,Low quality,42474,2
42475,"Wayyyy too large, looks nothing like the photo.",42475,2
42475,The material is ridiculously thick.,42475,2
42475,"I'm 5'9"", 133lb, 32D and got a M. It was massive.",42475,2
42476,Very cheap and poorly made corset!,42476,2
42476,Feels like a cheap costume.,42476,2
42476,Save your money and time and buy a better corset.,42476,2
42476,I bought a large and I didn't bother to fully try it on.,42476,2
42476,It was way too small just getting it out of the bag.,42476,2
42476,BTW I own more than my fair share of Corsets.,42476,2
42476,I was looking for something gold.,42476,2
42476,OF course I returned it.,42476,2
42476,I love AMAZON PRIME!,42476,2
42476,Pass on buying this one is my recommendation!,42476,2
42477,A bit too long,42477,2
42478,"Better than the other cheap necklaces, but still looks like it came out of a bubble gum machine.",42478,2
42479,I wear a size 8 but this came in a size smaller (or two maybe).,42479,2
42479,i think it's gorgeous but it's not the correct size,42479,2
42480,Ordered a large and the s*** fit like a small runs way small!,42480,2
42480,!,42480,2
42481,I ordered the large and it still didn't fit me.,42481,2
42481,I thought it would be more of a maroon color.,42481,2
42482,I have fairly small wrists so buying a bracelet can be a hassle from time to time.,42482,2
42482,"This bracelet, however; was pretty small.",42482,2
42482,I'd say it's more for a teenager not an adult.,42482,2
42483,Stone was out,42483,2
42484,"If you are big busted (dd) and short, this piece is probably going to make you look boxy.",42484,2
42484,The fit is roomy (1x) and the sleeves do not pinch/strangle if you have large arms.,42484,2
42484,"I liked the color/wash and the feel of the jacket, I just didn't like the way it looked on my body type.",42484,2
42484,Returned.,42484,2
42485,I have to learn to buy larger ftom the Internet.,42485,2
42486,Normally wear a small so purchased a medium 135lbs  5'7.,42486,2
42486,"Its super tight, and thin would have to wear a undershirt which would make it tighter.",42486,2
42486,Returning,42486,2
42487,I DIDN'T LIKE IT.,42487,2
42488,"Not well described, I thought the metal was Gold color but was Silver, the only Gold detail is the arch inside the resin.",42488,2
42488,"The resin look cheap and all irregular, the rubi look cheap and flat not sparkly, I returning this item, it doesn't go well with the fancy bags I wear...",42488,2
42489,One fit to small the other felt uncomfortable.,42489,2
42489,Returned both,42489,2
42490,The jacket is nice but my daughter can't even wear it!,42490,2
42490,The sizing is way off!,42490,2
42491,"Cheap dress, poor quality.",42491,2
42491,Sequins and material falling off as soon as I took it out of the bag.,42491,2
42491,Shoulders were very wide.,42491,2
42491,I am petite but have wider shoulders and this was too wide for me.,42491,2
42492,i would like to return this item.,42492,2
42493,Cheap material,42493,2
42494,It's shown ingraved in black but it arrives in tan engraved.,42494,2
42494,Not that happy about it.,42494,2
42494,Thinking about returning it possibly.,42494,2
42495,"Liked the shirt, seemed like quality material but the second time I washed it, it shrunk quite a bit.",42495,2
42495,Never had a shirt shrink like this.,42495,2
42496,Too wide and too short.,42496,2
42496,There is no ribbon in the front of the outfit they shipped to me.,42496,2
42496,I'll have to buy one and fix it myself because there is no time to return.,42496,2
42497,I bought this because it's super cheap.,42497,2
42497,"Well, it looks pretty cheap too.",42497,2
42497,"I'll wear it when I go to karaoke but other than that, it's not going to see the light of day much.",42497,2
42498,This was a gift.,42498,2
42498,"Based on comments, I ordered what I thought would be best size to hang properly.",42498,2
42498,"Receiver said it is WAY too big, and that even a medium might have been, as well.",42498,2
42498,"As one who doesn't own this type of shirt, I didn't know if it is most important to fit through the shoulders, or not be too tight at the hip.",42498,2
42498,"I'm bummed, because return/reorder will cause this gift to be too expensive.",42498,2
42499,I loved the design when I first got the watch but after wearing it for only a day that watch eye fell off without any propagation.,42499,2
42499,I had to crazy glue the watch eye back onto the watch and this was annoying but it also meant that whatever stains or glue remained on the inside cannot be wiped away.,42499,2
42499,It's just a fairly cheap watch in material (though beautiful when functional) but in this case it'll cost you in the end to have something this low of quality,42499,2
42500,The print was really nice and I thought it'd be perfect for a luau but I returned it because the fabric was really thin.,42500,2
42500,"But other than that, no complaints.",42500,2
42500,"The sizing was just fine for me (5'0"" and 100 lbs, and I got a size S).",42500,2
42501,"Arms were a little itchy, bow and arm warmers were not included as described and it was pretty pricey.",42501,2
42501,Like the colors though.,42501,2
42502,Nice size but all the stitching was loose and coming apart after a few days...,42502,2
42503,kind of a nothing style,42503,2
42504,This is very very small.,42504,2
42504,"I usually wear a small, size 4, but all the reviews said order a size up so I did.",42504,2
42504,Even the medium is way too tight.,42504,2
42504,"It's a cute dress and color, but it didn't work for me.",42504,2
42505,"These sunglasses are nice, but have a really wide frame.",42505,2
42505,They almost push my ears out a little bit because of how wide they are.,42505,2
42505,They will easily fall/slide off of your face or your head if you're wearing them there.,42505,2
42506,I don't like the way it flares at the waist.,42506,2
42506,I'm slender and it makes me look pregnant.,42506,2
42507,I wore once and ordered a new suit.,42507,2
42507,I feel like it's like a moo moo,42507,2
42508,I'm a tiny lady and even the medium doesn't fit.,42508,2
42508,It's cute but it's kinda awkward looking.,42508,2
42508,The bottom is smaller while the top is huge and fluffy.,42508,2
42508,The color and design is pretty tho.,42508,2
42508,I would have kept it if I could actually get it through my hips without feeling like I'm ripping it.,42508,2
42509,Not as depicted in picture: back & front hemlines are the same length & sleeves are 3/4 not long.,42509,2
42510,Nice earrings for a little girl.,42510,2
42510,"They are too small, so tiny people can barely notice it on your ears!",42510,2
42511,I have a slide belt top grain leather belt it's a solid piece of leather this belt by West does not look like a solid piece of leather  there is three layers You can see them when you cut the belt to fit  I would not buy it again  I will go back to my slide belt,42511,2
42512,I had to send this back.,42512,2
42512,It is made of very thin material and seemed cheap to me.,42512,2
42512,"Also, ALL the pockets are on the outside, which is ridiculous.",42512,2
42512,And it's HUGE.,42512,2
42512,Not good for a few hours at the baseball game.,42512,2
42512,Maybe if I was going on an extended baseball TRIP.,42512,2
42513,It was advertised as a sweater.,42513,2
42513,It is NOT a sweater; it is a sweatshirt.,42513,2
42514,"Pros:
- The band is comfortable, if a bit thick.",42514,2
42514,- The tool for replacing the pins is almost worth the price on its own.,42514,2
42514,- It looks really nice.,42514,2
42514,"Cons:
- The sizing is hard to adjust.",42514,2
42514,"- By the time you have it adjusted, you may have worn out the flimsy clasp so that it does not stay locked very well.",42514,2
42514,Any attempts to bend the locking mechanism into a tighter position only make it worse.,42514,2
42514,I will be getting another band.,42514,2
42515,Came all tangled and looks super cheap,42515,2
42516,Was so very excited when these bags arrived.,42516,2
42516,"They are beautiful, & because of my medical conditions I need to carry a big bag.",42516,2
42516,I was.,42516,2
42516,Thrilled to be able to fit what I need in big bag- with plenty of room to spare!,42516,2
42516,I happily clipped the strap on.,42516,2
42516,"On the very first day, the clip came apart!!!!!",42516,2
42516,There is no repairing it.,42516,2
42516,I give up.,42516,2
42516,I've ordered many bags but will NEVER do so again,42516,2
42517,"Hard to remove the protective covering, but that was relatively minor.",42517,2
42517,"My biggest complaint is that it warped in the shipping box, and now I can't seem to get it back to form.",42517,2
42517,"Its useable, but not very comfortable, and pretty dang warped.",42517,2
42517,It looks wonky as all getup when I put it on.,42517,2
42517,"Good thing I bought this more as a gag anyway, but definitely a waste of money considering the condition its in.",42517,2
42518,"It is pretty, but, I am not comfortable with the fit.",42518,2
42518,I wish I hadn't thrown away the paperwork or I would have returned it,42518,2
42519,Way too small,42519,2
42520,"was a little smaller than expected, and the belt was way too small.",42520,2
42521,This dress turned out fine.,42521,2
42521,"However it was way smaller, even ordering it at the largest size, than anticipated.",42521,2
42521,So I cut the under slip and was able to work with it.,42521,2
42521,"I love the dress, and received a great deal of compliments.",42521,2
42522,"While pretty it's rather large & heavy, the chain is very thin.",42522,2
42523,Too large.,42523,2
42524,Did not like this top.,42524,2
42524,Was a sheer fabric and too small.,42524,2
42524,"I normally wear a Medium or Large and ordered a XL just in case, and it was still too small.",42524,2
42525,I ordered a large due to some other comments about it fitting too small and it was way too big around the trunk but it was way too short!,42525,2
42525,"I'm 5'9"" and 145 lbs and I usually wear a medium.",42525,2
42525,"If the large was too short, I can't imagine how short the medium is.",42525,2
42526,"I have a closet full Carhartts in the exact same size and cut, but these were both too small and too short.",42526,2
42527,These are hard to put on and make my legs sweaty while wearing them.,42527,2
42527,They are very uncomfortable.,42527,2
42528,Arms are way tight.,42528,2
42528,It is also gauzy (see-thru).,42528,2
42529,"I love it......if it fit, i ordered a small, it looms like a dress on me.",42529,2
42529,"NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A SMALL, MORE MEDIUM LEANING TOWARD LARGE.",42529,2
42530,Very pretty shirt however it was way way way too small.,42530,2
42530,I knew it ran small so i ordered a 3x instead of a 2x and the shirt was still 4-5 sizes too small.,42530,2
42531,Got wrong size.,42531,2
42531,Too big to wear.,42531,2
42532,Could hardly get the ball out and couldn't get it back in once I took it out.,42532,2
42533,It came broken,42533,2
42534,Jacket overall is nice .,42534,2
42534,I usually wear L so I ordered XXL waited a month to get it.,42534,2
42534,"the big flaw of it though it the top of the arm connecting to the should is extremely tight, you're armpit is locked up and it's uncomfortable.",42534,2
42534,Costs too much to send back so I'm just gonna try to stretch it with some type of device.,42534,2
42535,"These gloves are not ""ridged"" enough and they are not what I expected.",42535,2
42535,"They are useless for ""donning"" any pair of substantial compression stockings.",42535,2
42535,"I will use them for household gloves and order serious ""donning"" gloves from ""Discount Surgical Supply.",42535,2
42536,Material was nice but definitely did not fit correctly.,42536,2
42536,Seemed cheap,42536,2
42537,ehhh.,42537,2
42537,Wasn't crazy about how it looked in person.,42537,2
42538,Love the quality and the print but way too small!,42538,2
42538,Not even sure an XL would do.,42538,2
42538,Was refunded.,42538,2
42539,I returned them because I prefer a little stretch in my Jammie pants.,42539,2
42539,These were also more fuzzy then I expected.,42539,2
42539,I don't do fuzzy,42539,2
42540,No stretch and runs small.,42540,2
42541,They were way too wide; I don't see how they could look good on anyone unless you have a very wide head.,42541,2
42541,Lenses were too dark that it made it difficult to see.,42541,2
42541,Returned them and will probably pay the extra money for real ray bans.,42541,2
42542,"The bra size on this is very small and doesn't stretch, so if you are expecting to squeeze into the cup it won't work.",42542,2
42542,"I should have returned it, but I think I'll just give it away.",42542,2
42543,One of the rings snapped in half on the way to me.,42543,2
42543,This seems to look like plastic when I looked at the center.,42543,2
42543,I question the description of this being a Silver set of rings.,42543,2
42544,"A lot of reviewers are saying this runs small, but it seems somewhat large to me.",42544,2
42544,"At 5'7"" and 230 lbs, the 1X is definitely quite roomy.",42544,2
42544,"It had a strong odor upon arrival, but it's fine after washing.",42544,2
42544,The fabric is quite thin - I certainly wouldn't answer the front door in it.,42544,2
42544,Update: This gown just didn't work for me.,42544,2
42544,I have to downgrade it from 3 stars to 2 stars.,42544,2
42544,It went to the thrift store to find a new home.,42544,2
42545,One of the shirts developed 2 holes after washing and wearing twice.,42545,2
42545,The design is also not a true side snap as the side seams are completely closed.,42545,2
42545,"The diagonal front snaps still help with making a wider opening for baby's head, but I was looking for shirts that you do not need to slide over baby's head to put on.",42545,2
42546,"The upper sleeves were very small, so much so that it could not be worn even once.",42546,2
42546,The body of the shirt for fine...,42546,2
42547,This shirt was way to small and short.,42547,2
42547,I can't remember but I think I ordered medium.,42547,2
42547,Never even wore it just tossed it up a donation pile.,42547,2
42547,Poor material too.,42547,2
42547,Looked nothing like picture.,42547,2
42548,"Nice fabric, had to return it too small.",42548,2
42548,Short waisted also.,42548,2
42549,It's a very cheaply made shirt.,42549,2
42549,NOTHING special at all.,42549,2
42549,Very basic and NOT flattering at all.,42549,2
42549,Returning for full refund.,42549,2
42550,Bought a medium and the bottoms were huge and the top was too small.,42550,2
42550,"I am 5'7"" 120lbs with very little up top so for the top to be too be small was shocking!",42550,2
42550,Also where the bottoms cross it is sewn funny and bunches up.,42550,2
42551,"My husband is tall, not fat...shirt should have been just as long but smaller.",42551,2
42552,Shirt is very cute but runs very small.,42552,2
42553,Strap broke on second wear.,42553,2
42553,Fit as expected.,42553,2
42553,Cute but kind of cheap looking,42553,2
42554,Love the shirt but the reason i rated it so low is because the affliction patch was sewed on upside down.,42554,2
42554,Idk whos at fault here the picture shows the patch regular.,42554,2
42554,I didn't know i was buying an irregular shirt.,42554,2
42554,I just removed the patch and sewed it back on the right way smh.,42554,2
42555,This coverup is very hard to figure out how to wear.,42555,2
42555,There were no directions included with the item.,42555,2
42555,It seems to run larger than expected.,42555,2
42555,"On the plus side, this is very soft and can also be worn as a scarf.",42555,2
42556,The jumper itself was nice but one of the belt loops were missing and it had ink stains on it,42556,2
42557,They look great and fit ok.,42557,2
42557,"But thought ""imported"" meant they were Ray Ban made in Italy.",42557,2
42557,Not so.,42557,2
42557,They are made in China :( should have asked ahead since that's a lot of money to pay for a pair of kids glasses made in China.,42557,2
42558,Bought the same cardigan from the same seller in black and the black one was fine.,42558,2
42558,The white one was too small...?,42558,2
42559,This shirt is way too small even the largest size XXL is way too small.,42559,2
42560,There was way to much padding in the bra area!,42560,2
42560,And the suit was not lined in the back which made in look  see through.,42560,2
42561,"It rolls up from the hips, is difficult to put on by myself and is not hidden under clothing.",42561,2
42561,I think you could probably get the same benefits from a cheaper version.,42561,2
42561,"This being my first baby, I can't speak to if it helps more or not- I do like the support it provided for my back and feeling held together",42561,2
42562,"The suit is adorable, but it had to be returned.",42562,2
42562,"First of all, the color was nothing like I expected.",42562,2
42562,"I saw a pink and coral floral pattern on my screen (yes, I know they're variable) and so when I pulled something closer to neon orange or if the box, I was a bit surprised.",42562,2
42562,"I was willing to let that slide, but there was another bigger (or smaller, depending on how you look at it) problem.",42562,2
42562,"I'm 5'7"", around 220lb, generally wear a size 14 bottom, and wear a 38DD top.",42562,2
42562,The bottom fit perfectly.,42562,2
42562,"The top, on the other hand, is not meant for anyone larger than a B cup.",42562,2
42562,I've never been cut in half so hard.,42562,2
42562,So it seems to me that they're either sending tiny tops with all bottoms or they have no idea that big girls also tends to have big boobs.,42562,2
42562,"Even a B cup is more than a handful with a 38 band size, folks.",42562,2
42563,"Aesthetically pleasing, and the materials seem to be pretty good quality.",42563,2
42563,Does not keep time worth a lick.,42563,2
42564,it looks better in the pic,42564,2
42565,I ordered and xl I usually wear a size US 12 and these pants are skin tight even though they are spandex.,42565,2
42565,The color is more of a baby blue than it is Jean blue.,42565,2
42565,Just came in an hour ago.,42565,2
42565,"Not sure if I will return, keep, or give away",42565,2
42566,to small,42566,2
42567,"great fit and comfort .heel wears out way too fast,too bad cause i use to love these socks.",42567,2
42568,"Cute shirt, but if you have a chest, order two sizes up because they definitely run small and the shirt doesn't stretch at all.",42568,2
42568,"Ordered mine for an event and had to return it because of the size, so I didn't have time to order another one in time.",42568,2
42569,too small and ridiculously wrinkled.,42569,2
42570,I love the look of this suit but it is way too small..I typically wear a size 6 bottoms and this was very tight to even get around my hips/ butt.,42570,2
42570,"I ordered a large and am 5"" tall 115 lbs.",42570,2
42570,It would have been way to tight to wear even at my height.,42570,2
42570,It is also a higher cut in the hip area but that is noted.,42570,2
42570,Material seems to be decent though I cant say how it would hold up.,42570,2
42570,Not worth returning.,42570,2
42571,"The color is not quite the same, and it fits very small.",42571,2
42572,It's to big!,42572,2
42572,And it's really rough!,42572,2
42572,It doesn't look anything like the picture!,42572,2
42573,"This bag I bought for my daughter to use at school, however the sewing on it has torn and the straps have come off the backpack (in 4 weeks).",42573,2
42573,"It is not suited for daily use, so if you are considering to buy this for a school backpack, do not buy it.",42573,2
42574,"If you like cheap garbage, get this ring.",42574,2
42574,Definitely not worth 20 bucks.,42574,2
42575,I ordered the small ( usually wear xs) it was way to big in width and to short like a crop top .,42575,2
42575,The picture is very deceiving .,42575,2
42575,Sadly returning .,42575,2
42576,This is the 2nd pair I've had of this particular item and both of them broke.,42576,2
42577,Not constructed well.,42577,2
42577,Arms were overly big and stretchy while the rest of the shirt was stiff.,42577,2
42578,"I followed the sizing chart according to pants size, and they were too small probably go up at least one size, if not too.",42578,2
42579,"This skirt is super soft, fit good, but material is very thin.",42579,2
42579,I bought the black and it is necessary to wear a slip underneath.,42579,2
42580,Sizing not accurate and no ball room,42580,2
42581,I like Good,42581,2
42582,The shoe started tearing apart after two weeks.,42582,2
42582,Yes my toddler son can do a lot to a shoe but his prior sneakers didn't fall apart that quickly.,42582,2
42583,Looked and felt very cheap.,42583,2
42584,Way smaller than size chart description.,42584,2
42585,Looked good but they got a huge run (like pantyhose) in one wearing.,42585,2
42585,Now I can't wear them.,42585,2
42586,This is more of an Asian size.,42586,2
42586,The top was ordered in x large and was more of a medium.,42586,2
42586,Did not like the bottom at all.,42586,2
42586,Definitely not what I was expecting.,42586,2
42587,NIce suit - size poorly though.,42587,2
42587,The low rating though is due to a product return that has yet to be refunded.,42587,2
42588,Really cute!,42588,2
42588,But it was thin and ran so small that I have my 2X to a teenager who wears a size 2.,42588,2
42589,"very cheap looking, not as expected",42589,2
42590,Returned.,42590,2
42590,I have wide fingers and these were just uncomfortable and didn't look right on me.,42590,2
42591,I didn't get the lip rings in the package..,42591,2
42591,"The package came and I was super excited to try them out, but when I opened the package all that was in the box was an alcohol wipe and the bonus gift.",42591,2
42591,"However, they were super cool about it and gave me my money back with no questions asked..",42591,2
42592,Ok,42592,2
42593,Sleeves to short,42593,2
42594,To large and cheaply made.,42594,2
42594,Will have to alter it if I ever wear it.,42594,2
42595,I purchased this wallet specifically because the pattern/fabric matched the inside of a Vera Bradley handbag which I had purchased last year.,42595,2
42595,I've had the wallet now for about two months and am finally coming to the realization that I am not satisfied with the design.,42595,2
42595,"Unfortunately, the slits/pockets that are in the flap specifically for holding credit and other cards are so tight, that I am only able to use one side of the flap and have to leave the other side empty because it is almost impossible to remove your cards once they are all loaded.",42595,2
42595,"I had hoped maybe they would loosen up over time, but that has not happened.",42595,2
42595,"I hate to return things, but it really bothers me to use it in such limited capacity.",42595,2
42596,I waited a long time for these and they ripped out of the package.,42596,2
42596,Won't try this brand again.,42596,2
42597,Sizing is completely off!,42597,2
42598,"Sure, they're extremely cheap, and everyone loves that.",42598,2
42598,"But DO NOT, put the balls in alcohol.",42598,2
42598,"They will break, guaranteed.",42598,2
42598,I'm down a good many from trying to clean them.,42598,2
42598,"At first I thought some may be defects, but I promise you, put them in alcohol and they are done for.",42598,2
42598,I lost my favorite ones from this.,42598,2
42599,Cheaply made.,42599,2
42599,Was falling apart at seams when I received it.,42599,2
42599,Returned it.,42599,2
42600,This is very comfy to wear all day and all night.,42600,2
42600,"Fit was great, especially at first.",42600,2
42600,But after about 5 days this folds and bunches and really doesn't seem to function as intended anymore.,42600,2
42600,That's very disappointing considering how $$$ it was and also considering I was hoping to wear this 5-6 weeks.,42600,2
42600,I'm not sure this will survive structurally for much more than a week.,42600,2
42600,"And yes, I have the right size... yes, I'm a bit flubbery all the way around... but this product is intended to be used post-pregnancy so the target consumer will be all of these things!!",42600,2
42600,I expected better.,42600,2
42601,"I received an entirely different print, color, and style.",42601,2
42601,It is not knit but a ink pattern on polyester material.,42601,2
42601,It does look cute with jeans even though it was not what I ordered.,42601,2
42602,This was too small and I am in process of returning it.,42602,2
42603,Print is almost nonexistent.,42603,2
42603,Can't see Jesus' face and text very well.,42603,2
42603,Took forever to arrive as well.,42603,2
42604,the gems came out within the days i got it in the mail,42604,2
42605,The hardware falls off.,42605,2
42606,"Came with no instructions for how to wear (and oddly, I really can't find anything online that's been clear enough to remedy the issue) and was too small despite following the size guidelines to a T.  Friends highly recommended this to me, swearing that you could wear your regular pants through pregnancy with it.",42606,2
42606,"I can't get the hang of it - it's just not comfortable or natural for me, and it feels too tight around the hips.",42606,2
42606,Very disappointed - not a cheap purchase!,42606,2
42607,"I wore the ""shirt stays"" for a couple of weeks and they worked as described when it comes to functionality.",42607,2
42607,"It held my shirts in place for the two weeks, however, the clamping mechanism that attaches to the shirt, operates on a pivot or hinge which is made up of a small metal wire just a little bit larger than a big paper clip.",42607,2
42607,"Over the two weeks, the wire would fall out of the clamp when I disconnected it from the shirt and then fell out on its own.",42607,2
42607,I can no longer use the product.,42607,2
42607,It was pretty much a waste of money.,42607,2
42607,I will order a different brand and do not recommend ordering this product.,42607,2
42608,This had a permanent stain / discoloration on one side of it when I received it.,42608,2
42609,The sizing of French Toast Boys Cargo Shorts was not in line with the French Toast Adjustable Boys Double Knee Pants.,42609,2
42609,As a result I returned the shorts and purchased a larger size.,42609,2
42610,"Very weak, so rips very easily.",42610,2
42611,Looks soooo cheap.,42611,2
42611,It will protect only from summer wind i guess.,42611,2
42611,Wouldn't recommend,42611,2
42612,The top half is weirdly large.,42612,2
42612,"Many threads are loose, and the material is very thin.",42612,2
42612,Not great,42612,2
42613,Really a very small bag.,42613,2
42613,Too small for most women.,42613,2
42614,Not very good quality looks better in the picture,42614,2
42615,"Returned, was a gift they didn't like the fit.",42615,2
42616,The sweater is cute but  not great quality.,42616,2
42616,I ordered it a size larger as instructed in the item description and it fits.,42616,2
42616,"However, there is no label to show which side is the front or back.",42616,2
42616,It also doesn't have a care label.,42616,2
42616,I just washed it and I'm hoping it lasts through this winter.,42616,2
42617,CHEAP looking!,42617,2
42618,"I looks much simpler than in the picture, other than that its a cheap, usable necklace.",42618,2
42619,Order at least one size larger,42619,2
42620,Smaller than shown on the model,42620,2
42621,I ordered three wallets; they all smelled of mold.,42621,2
42622,Bad quality,42622,2
42623,Sizes run really small,42623,2
42624,The shirt is nice but it is not white.,42624,2
42624,It is more of a grey.,42624,2
42624,"The writing does not pop like the picture, it actually kind of blends into the shirt making it difficult to see.",42624,2
42625,This dress is so cute but runs very small it's sad because I really like it .I wear a medium to large and the large was still to small..,42625,2
42626,This is a cute bikini but the quality of the material is cheap.,42626,2
42627,A little small and pinker than expected,42627,2
42628,I so so so wanted to love this.,42628,2
42628,I even paid extra for next day shipping because I needed it for a pool party last weekend and I thought it would look perfect with my new bathing suit.,42628,2
42628,I feel the picture on the model is VERY deceptive.,42628,2
42628,"When looking at the picture it almost looks like a gorgeous exotic macrame hand tied rope design; however, when you zoom in on the picture of just the skirt (not the picture that the model is wearing) it is very grainy but you can see more of how the skirt is constructed.",42628,2
42628,"The skirt design is more like pieces cut out to form the pattern not a beautiful hand tied looking design...or heck factory tied design....Also, the model in the picture must be VERY short.",42628,2
42628,"I'm 5'3"" with a 26"" waist and 37"" inch hips.....the skirt came to about my ankles unless I really pulled it down ( I certainly couldn't get the lovely to the floor look that the model is wearing)....I didn't have any issues with the sizing.",42628,2
42628,"Truthfully, I would not recommend this cover-up.",42628,2
42628,I purchased one at our local grocery store on clearance for $7 and my husband couldn't stop raving about that one and with next day shipping this cost well over $25 and he didn't like it at all.,42628,2
42628,"I really wanted to wear my cute white swim suit that didn't look right with my grocery store cover-up so I still wore this; however, definitely no compliments and nothing exotic looking about it at all.",42628,2
42628,"Where I will still wear it because it ""works"" with my swimsuit, there certainly isn't any WOW factor or heck any factor for that mater...I will try and post pictures as that speaks volumes and maybe what I pictured seeing on the model is different than you see.",42628,2
42628,"For me, I would not purchase again.",42628,2
42629,I'll give 2 stars because I actually liked this dress but the size is not for your typical US plus size woman.,42629,2
42629,I had to give it to my cousin.,42629,2
42630,Bra poorly designed,42630,2
42631,"I'm 5'0 125 lbs, ordered a Large because I read in reviews that they ran small but the Large was still too small.",42631,2
42632,I ordered three.,42632,2
42632,.one had one seed in it.,42632,2
42632,Theyes are hard to see because the reflection of light on the glass.,42632,2
42632,Also the wish doesn't seem to want to face the right direction due to lack of correct links.,42632,2
42632,The necklace chain is long which is wonderful (cept I ordered for 7/8th old girls.),42632,2
42632,Not a bad purchase for the price.,42632,2
42632,:/  not sure however I'd repeat the order again for anyone else.,42632,2
42633,"It was bad, it looks like it was worn so many times.",42633,2
42633,The fabric and the buttons were bad and the size was big.,42633,2
42633,However it does make you warm.,42633,2
42633,But I don't recommend it.,42633,2
42634,Not a very comfortable bracelet.,42634,2
42634,The edges are kind of sharp.,42634,2
42634,It does it's job though.,42634,2
42635,Dress wasn't as in picture or discription the backless dress zipped up to my neck and sleeves didn't match extremely long 4 ft train and too big .seller was very good to work with on refund.,42635,2
42636,weird cut.,42636,2
42636,its stretches out easily and stays that way until you wash and dry it again.,42636,2
42637,The print is faded as if it was already worn.,42637,2
42637,I can see the tshirt through the ink on the logos.,42637,2
42638,"I bought a size large, im 5'3 ,145lbs.",42638,2
42638,Was a little big.,42638,2
42638,Very see thru  though.,42638,2
42639,The shoulder and arm holes are tight and I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear.,42639,2
42640,"I got what I ordered, but not what I expected, clunky and uncomfortable , plus looks bad ....not going to use them....",42640,2
42641,"As other reviewers have said, this shirt fit fine out of the package, but with one washing (yes, I read the label directions), the shirt sleeve shrank significantly in length (more than 1"", leaving no cuff exposure possible on me with a jacket), and the collar shrunk enough to be uncomfortable to button.",42641,2
42641,"Still fine for a use as a casual shirt with some jeans, it seems well made and with a comfortable fabric, but the shrinkage makes this an unacceptable product for a dress wardrobe.",42641,2
42641,"That's really a shame, because the shirt feels great otherwise.",42641,2
42642,It's a literal tshirt,42642,2
42643,"They are not extra tall, they fit regular in the length.",42643,2
42644,Came late after the dates it said even though I had rushed ordered it.,42644,2
42644,Beads fall off pretty easily tried to return but they wouldn't let me.,42644,2
42644,I have no use for it since it came late.,42644,2
42645,"I'm 5'10"" and 135 (size A cup and smaller butt/hips) and a Medium was WAY too small on me.",42645,2
42645,I could barely put it on.,42645,2
42645,"Also the colors are way off in the picture--you get vibrant, bold colors instead of a dainty, country floral colors/patters.",42645,2
42645,Will be returning.,42645,2
42646,Wasn't what I was hoping for,42646,2
42647,A very pretty maxi dress with a great black and white pattern.,42647,2
42647,"However, the neckline is cut EXTREMELY low.",42647,2
42647,The fact that the model is wearing a cami underneath her dress should have given me a clue.,42647,2
42647,(The white under-fabric is NOT part of the dress!).,42647,2
42647,There is not enough fabric to see the front up even a little bit.,42647,2
42647,"I tried it on with a cami underneath, and it doesn't look any wear near as nice as the way it is pictured here.",42647,2
42647,"I suppose it could be worn at the beach, over a bathing suit.",42647,2
42647,I'm pretty sure I'm sending mine back.,42647,2
42648,Very small.,42648,2
42648,I didn't realize sizing chart was so different.,42648,2
42648,I should have checked first.,42648,2
42648,But very pretty.,42648,2
42649,Really nice for the price.,42649,2
42649,Wish they had packaged it better.,42649,2
42649,Arrived folded so there is a crease I cannot seem to get rid of.,42649,2
42650,It is so pretty but the size does not fit as expected.,42650,2
42650,i ordered an XL because I like having a little room.,42650,2
42650,This came and I can not even zip it up.,42650,2
42650,Def will not fit over my chest at all.,42650,2
42650,I wear a size 38 DDD in bra.,42650,2
42650,This hoodie is super small.,42650,2
42650,I expected better.,42650,2
42650,Maybe it is a knock off.,42650,2
42650,I usually buy Polo from macys and have not had this problem,42650,2
42651,The backside of the bottoms are smallish and have ruching down the middle.,42651,2
42651,Very unflattering on me but I'm sure very cute on the right booty,42651,2
42652,my nephew is 18 months.,42652,2
42652,"the top and the jacket fit perfect, the pants were flooded and looked like capris.",42652,2
42652,unfortunately the pants and shirt are attached so we couldn't use it.,42652,2
42652,also the snaps near the diaper are really far apart so we could easily tell he was wearing a diaper.,42652,2
42653,They run big!,42653,2
42653,Like HUGE!,42653,2
42654,I  ordered  an extra large it feels small,42654,2
42655,Fabric is super soft but the top fit more like a crop top.,42655,2
42655,I ordered a medium Im 135 pounds and 5'6 I'd like to consider myself average so I was disappointed that it was short it's now a pajama shirt.,42655,2
42656,No dimension.,42656,2
42656,Flat and cheap looking,42656,2
42657,I love the color of this dress.,42657,2
42657,The color was a little lighter than I expected.,42657,2
42657,"However, it is extremely small.",42657,2
42657,"I can wear an XL, but I ordered a 2XL to be sure it fit.",42657,2
42657,It was still too small in the chest and I do not have a large chest.,42657,2
42658,For a medium it is more wide than it is long.,42658,2
42658,The graphic itself was really disappointing.,42658,2
42658,It is very difficult to tell that it is toothless.,42658,2
42658,"I bought it for my friend who insisted I not return it, and that she would use it as a sleep shirt.",42658,2
42658,For the cost of this I expected it to have decent details.,42658,2
42658,At least the shirt is soft!,42658,2
42659,"This is a very cute hat and it is well made, but it was WAAAAAAYYY too large.",42659,2
42659,"I ordered it for my daughter's Halloween costume, and was unable to use it.",42659,2
42659,"She is 7.5 months old, and her head circumference is average, so this should have fit just fine.",42659,2
42659,"I am keeping the item because it will fit eventually, and hopefully she can use it next summer.",42659,2
42660,don't like it canceled it out,42660,2
42661,This was very cheap looking I sent it back.,42661,2
42662,The dress itself is cute and okay quality for the price.,42662,2
42662,It arrived much quicker than anticipated.,42662,2
42662,I usually wear size medium and it fits like an XS.,42662,2
42662,The sizes are more likely for teenagers FYI,42662,2
42663,be sure to get 2 sizes bigger than you normally wear,42663,2
42664,This was so small and I ordered 3 sizes up.,42664,2
42664,It was too short and barely passed my belly button.,42664,2
42664,I'm only 5'4 this should have fit.,42664,2
42664,Save your money,42664,2
42665,"love the fit  color was what I ordered, fast delivery this is the second time I've ordered this bra and there is a defect in the way the under wire is installed the first time  I ordered two of them and all of them the under wire came out after wearing them about three times.",42665,2
42665,I'm hoping that that this one is not the same thing.,42665,2
42665,If so it will be the last time.,42665,2
42665,this product was full purchase price  this unbiased opinion  is mine,42665,2
42666,This is a kids hat.,42666,2
42666,"I'm 5""6' and this hat is clearly for kids.",42666,2
42666,Shame on you for advertising this as a mans hat.,42666,2
42667,Material not as I expected.,42667,2
42668,Poor.quality =(,42668,2
42669,Petty cheaply made.,42669,2
42669,Button to turn on the light broke almost immediately.,42669,2
42670,was tarnished,42670,2
42671,The shoe was comfortable to the point of not even thinking about the fit.,42671,2
42671,"The arch support was fairly good for my high arch but, after a long walk around the airport the ball of my foot started to hurt.",42671,2
42671,Looking at my foot I found the starting of a blister on the ball of one foot.,42671,2
42671,Looking at the sandel I noticed a slit/line under the foot lining.,42671,2
42671,"The area was where the shoe bends, at the ball of the foot, when you walk and was pinching my foot every time I took a step.",42671,2
42671,Lucky for me I had Mole skin to cover the blister for the rest of the trip home.,42671,2
42671,I had to return the shoes.,42671,2
42671,I don't know if this is a defect or the shoe just hit one foot wrong but I am afraid to wear this style again.,42671,2
42672,"Love the design but these fell apart on the first wash. :( very sad, it was one of the few mcfc things my boyfriend didn't have.",42672,2
42672,He was super excited to wear these on game day but they only lasted 1 game.,42672,2
42672,Will upload picture shortly,42672,2
42673,Too small.,42673,2
42673,Looks cool but it's too small.,42673,2
42674,The shape of the necklace is straight and not bend like in the picture,42674,2
42675,briefs are very small Medium is a small by us standards..,42675,2
42676,I opened the package and tried this on in front of my husband.,42676,2
42676,He said it looked like someone cut the front of his grandmother's nightgown open and made it in to a jacket.,42676,2
42676,I walked to the mirror and knew exactly what he was talking about.,42676,2
42676,"The pattern is cute, but it totally looks like a grandmas nightgown with the stitching around the neck.",42676,2
42676,Returning ASAP!!,42676,2
42676,!,42676,2
42677,4 out of 6 were stained right out of the bag,42677,2
42678,It is a gorgeous dress but it the size descriptions are not accurate.,42678,2
42678,I am normally a small and after trying it on I had to exchange it for a bigger side because while it fit waste wise it crushed my upper body.,42678,2
42678,When I got the medium after the exchange the dress was too big on me and wasn't flattering at all.,42678,2
42678,This is a dress that either fits you or it doesn't and it unfortunately didn't fit me.,42678,2
42679,I was really excited about this.,42679,2
42679,Unfortunately after waiting for a while for it to get here it doesn't even fit!,42679,2
42679,I am usually between a medium and a large and I ordered an extra large.,42679,2
42679,The material seems to be pretty good quality and it's super cute but I could barely pull it up over my hips and when I did it was so short on me!,42679,2
42679,"It didn't even fully cover my books and I am only 5'4"".",42679,2
42679,If you are going to buy this go up 2 or 3 sizes and be prepared to wait weeks,42679,2
42680,The fit is not what to expected.,42680,2
42681,"The shirt is a very nice thick material but it is a mans t-shirt...The description and the picture of the shirt indicate it is a ""Women's T-Shirt, but it is not...Very cute and exactly as pictured but the shirt itself is cut for a man...",42681,2
42682,It said that this is for BIG GIRLS!!!,42682,2
42682,These are ADULT sizes!!,42682,2
42682,Very disappointed :(,42682,2
42683,Legs are tight.,42683,2
42683,Waist too big.,42683,2
42683,I have bought many pairs of Pajama Jeans but I will never but these again,42683,2
42684,I Should have read measurement chart better.,42684,2
42684,Sending back 2 dresses so far.,42684,2
42685,"Very thin, way to long.",42685,2
42685,A small was way to big and that is my normal size .,42685,2
42686,Asia XXL = US M 8/10 actually fit like a US XL,42686,2
42687,"Didn't fix well, not a dressy outfit.",42687,2
42688,Great style but material looks cheap.,42688,2
42688,"I'd wear it in the dark so no one could see the poor quality of the material and stitching, seams.",42688,2
42689,I thought this would be a great little boho cover up.,42689,2
42689,"The material is nice and light, and the embroidery is pretty.",42689,2
42689,"I thought it would come down to my hips, but it barely hits above my waist.",42689,2
42689,It's much shorter than the picture shows.,42689,2
42689,"Still nice, and I will wear just not at all what the picture depicted and what I expected.",42689,2
42689,I'm also only 5'3 so it's not like it had much to cover.,42689,2
42690,Was not impressed at all with the quality of this swimsuit.,42690,2
42690,"It did not fit the way it was described and was cheaply made so that when I tried it on, it ripped at the seam.",42690,2
42690,Had to give it to a thrift store.,42690,2
42690,Will not purchase from this company again.,42690,2
42691,"For some reason, this tee shirt seemed exceptionally cheaply made.",42691,2
42691,I saw one in the store .... same brand; same size and it was very nice.,42691,2
42691,Neckline was stretched out on the one I received.,42691,2
42691,Didn't return because it would cost me more to return it then I paid for it.,42691,2
42691,I guess you get what you pay for!,42691,2
42692,"Runs super small, so my daughter is happy to have it.",42692,2
42693,Definitely not made for anyone with curves.,42693,2
42693,Additionally the straps are too short so I've had to rig the top.,42693,2
42694,"The top fit , but the bottom did not.",42694,2
42695,This shoe feels like styrofoam and runs too small,42695,2
42696,"Cheap material , definitely not what i expected.",42696,2
42697,"I usually love Lucky Brand, but this fit too small, sent it back.",42697,2
42698,I went to go out the smallest size in first and opened the package and there's two different sizes in the 8 g package.,42698,2
42698,"Not to impressed, now i have to buy a separate pack bc someone didn't send the right ones.",42698,2
42698,Plus the smallest gauge in the 8g pack was bent.,42698,2
42699,Its an OK dress but it feels really cheap material and finish.,42699,2
42699,Once your dress it it is actually cute but I was expecting it was a better quality for other similar priced vintage dresses,42699,2
42700,Cut oddly under my arms and that was tight and uncomfortable.,42700,2
42701,Really tiny,42701,2
42702,"Cute belt, however, I wore it a couple times and it started coming apart.",42702,2
42702,Very disappointed!,42702,2
42702,!,42702,2
42703,very see through,42703,2
42704,small.,42704,2
42704,cheap material.,42704,2
42705,Too thick and bulky.,42705,2
42705,Too pricey for the quality.,42705,2
42706,This lasted us for 1/2 day - the fishing line is coming out already.,42706,2
42706,The tutu is falling apart...,42706,2
42707,I ordered a large for my mother and got an extra large.,42707,2
42707,She is going in vacation and I won't have time to replace it.,42707,2
42707,Very unsatisfied,42707,2
42708,The material is nice but it is way too small.,42708,2
42708,I bought a size that I should fit in very comfortably but it was way too tight around my thighs and butt.,42708,2
42708,I would order two sizes up from what you think you need unless you are very slender in your legs and butt,42708,2
42709,Not polarized.,42709,2
42709,They look good and are comfortable.,42709,2
42710,"it is a beautify jumpsuit, the color is like a yellow banana whereas the picture looks more like a mustard color.",42710,2
42710,but the worst problem is the material.,42710,2
42710,"it is very thin and you can see everything through, panty line and all.",42710,2
42710,and you cannot wear a slip because it is a jumpsuit.,42710,2
42710,perhaps if it was lined that would make a big difference.,42710,2
42710,I am really disapointed with this purchase.,42710,2
42711,The material,42711,2
42712,The fit was not for a newborn it would fit my 4 year old yet the packaging states newborn.,42712,2
42712,The funny thing is its made in china so I would expect it to be on the small side.,42712,2
42712,Looks like I have to return it.,42712,2
42713,"Nice items but they arrived dirty , will not but again",42713,2
42714,"Nice looking shirt, but does not fit like a normal 2XL.",42714,2
42715,"All the rings were too small, i suppose i could put them all on my pinkies, except the bow.",42715,2
42715,The bow fit except after a while it began to agitate my skin and I had to take it off.,42715,2
42715,"Order the more expensive rings, it's worth it.",42715,2
42716,"The shirt/dress/whatever it was,  was actually rather large on me everywhere,  save for the bust.",42716,2
42716,It made me look like a slutty bloated tomato.,42716,2
42716,"The color was exceptional,  however.",42716,2
42716,That's the only reason it gets 2 stars.,42716,2
42716,"If you're busty, I don't recommend it.",42716,2
42717,"I am 5'7"" 135 size 2/4 in pants, small in tops, ordered a medium and the skirt part of this was way too small.",42717,2
42717,So small it was flattening my booty and it was also see through between my legs.,42717,2
42717,"The top/shirt part fit and was cute, it's on the way back to Amazon.",42717,2
42717,Also the dress I received was clearly a return from someone else b/c there was a long strand of blond hair inside the package containing the dress,42717,2
42718,I really liked how these fit but the material was awful - stiff and scratchy.,42718,2
42718,"I usually wear Greys Anatomy scrub pants, so I wasn't expecting that kind of softness for half the price, but i also wasn't expecting a road rash on my inner thighs after my 12 hour shift.",42718,2
42718,"I thought the fabric might soften up a bit after washing, but this time I got a rash on my inner things and bum only 6 hours into my shift.",42718,2
42718,I would never buy these again or recommend them.,42718,2
42718,Kudos to Amazon for a painless return process.,42718,2
42719,I like the idea of the skirt and saw a similar skirt at LF for a hell of a lot more.,42719,2
42719,Unfortunately the tacky label is clearly visible on it and the color does not match the picture.,42719,2
42719,This skirt looks much cheaper in quality than in the picture....,42719,2
42720,Whoa!,42720,2
42720,Medium was even too small for my niece who is a size 2.,42720,2
42721,I'm not sure who this is supposed to fit.,42721,2
42721,"My 9mo old is big for her age, but these were SO snug, i could barely get them up.",42721,2
42722,Was not aware that this dress was a mesh dress.,42722,2
42722,To me it's more suitable as a beach wear,42722,2
42723,"Weird fabric, cape was smaller than in the pic, no belt",42723,2
42724,broke apart,42724,2
42725,"Looks cheap, and it's big on top, and a little too small around the middle.",42725,2
42725,You get what you pay for.,42725,2
42726,I love his but I have bigger tatas so it doesn't cover them at all and they just kept falling out and the part that goes around the back runs small so i couldn't clasp it.,42726,2
42726,If this was made differently I would have bought ever color,42726,2
42727,We've ordered many kid jersey/short combos.,42727,2
42727,"This combo is the same quality as the rest  however, the socks are not as pictured.",42727,2
42727,"Instead, we received cheap plain black tube socks.",42727,2
42727,That's why I'm giving a low rating.,42727,2
42728,I would give only one star but hate is not the way I feel.,42728,2
42728,I know I would like this if it was in a larger size.,42728,2
42728,"before I picked a size I read the reviews, looked at their sizing chart, and even was like a size bigger would be okay.",42728,2
42728,NOPE!,42728,2
42728,I'm a 4/6 and in most of my swim suit I wear a small.,42728,2
42728,I got a medium.,42728,2
42728,I cant even kind of fit in it and it be okay without being on the people of Walmart page.,42728,2
42728,You know that line when you know you should go a size bigger in something but you also know that the size bigger wouldn't fit you as good?,42728,2
42728,Well this was a I need 3 sizes bigger.,42728,2
42728,It's cute but cheap material.,42728,2
42728,Not bad for the price.,42728,2
42729,Its cute but a bit baggy and super short.,42729,2
42730,Pulls oddly.,42730,2
42731,Was no where near what I was expecting.,42731,2
42731,Cheaply made.,42731,2
42731,Hinges on the top about broke when I tried to open the locket for the first time.,42731,2
42731,Urn isn't even held in on the inside.,42731,2
42731,"The minute I opened it, the urn fell out.",42731,2
42731,Not pleased at all.,42731,2
42732,It shrunk quite a bit,42732,2
42733,The diamond parts are a lot bigger in person.,42733,2
42733,Kind of heavy as well for nipple piercings.,42733,2
42734,Its ok.,42734,2
42735,Not much support to the top...,42735,2
42735,"Looked cute, but if I moved... it didn't work for me.",42735,2
42736,"The watch hands do not move, returning it.",42736,2
42737,It should of been longer in length,42737,2
42738,Fit was right but it looked weird on the top.,42738,2
42738,Like they kept the small but just added more to the sides so the straps were only a few inches apart.,42738,2
42738,Returned as it didn't look right and the fabric was uncomfortable.,42738,2
42739,Mmmmm.... not very good qualilty.,42739,2
42740,"The 1X, my usual size, fit like a 3X so it adds volume where none is needed.",42740,2
42740,The front fits longer than the back.,42740,2
42740,The fleece is thin which can be okay but I've never experienced flimsy fleece.,42740,2
42740,The snaps are very small and cheapen the look.,42740,2
42740,"I'd looked forward to buying more colors but with the unpredictable sizing, front drooping and small snaps, I'll look for another brand.",42740,2
42741,"These earrings are pretty, but they are so thin...not much more substantial than foil.",42741,2
42741,Even the wires are smaller than usual.,42741,2
42741,I couldn't even get a safety back to stay on to secure the earrings to my ear.,42741,2
42741,One of the earrings fell off on my first wear.,42741,2
42741,I am sad about this because they are pretty.,42741,2
42742,Way smaller than expected.,42742,2
42742,Very thin/sheer.,42742,2
42742,Cheaplyade.,42742,2
42742,"It is very pretty, but it just doesn't fit.",42742,2
42743,"If you are JUST looking for needles, then I guess it's okay (though you're better off getting those by themselves) otherwise this kit is pretty poor.",42743,2
42743,"Mine came with everything, but the jewelry wasn't even close to fitting in the needle, which is useless.",42743,2
42743,"Luckily for me I had a few from previous piercings that fit, but I would have liked to use what came with it- crazy idea, right?",42743,2
42743,I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to others.,42743,2
42744,I liked the bracelet but it broke within a few days.,42744,2
42745,This item is very cute but it ripped on the sides as I tried it on.,42745,2
42745,I guess you get what you pay for.,42745,2
42745,It seems kind of disposable.,42745,2
42746,Broke 10 minutes after I put it on!!,42746,2
42746,Not happy!,42746,2
42746,!,42746,2
42747,"unfortunately the shirt were not the size expected when i went to USA 2 year ago, i buy the same shirt and in XL size and this not fitted well, for this reason i have requested a XXL but now was too big, apparently the size that makes Hugo Boss is not standard,

42748,"The shorts were so cute and amazing, but the shirt was weird??",42748,2
42748,The sleeves were practically sewn onto the middle of what would be a tube top and there was no way to make it work without me feeling like the sleeves would work out.,42748,2
42748,It was worth it for the price just for the shorts but sadly I don't think I'll ever wear the shirt!,42748,2
42748,Bummed :/,42748,2
42749,Not made very well,42749,2

42752,"They stick, but don't look as good as the silicone petals.",42752,2
42752,You can see an outline under shirt and not real comfortable to wear for long periods of time.,42752,2
42753,odd fabric,42753,2
42754,"I love the dress, and describes Asian size.",42754,2
42754,"If you are petite, this is perfect.",42754,2
42755,Prettier in photo.,42755,2
42755,Cheaply made.,42755,2
42755,What was I expecting for the price?,42755,2
42756,"Not so good quality the bow came right off, you get what you pay for.",42756,2
42757,My daughter is three years old and small.,42757,2
42757,"I ordered the 3T, but they were too large, so I returned them for a 2T.",42757,2
42757,These were also weirdly baggy on her.,42757,2
42757,They fit at the waist but gapped at the thighs.,42757,2
42757,"She is really skinny, but I haven't had this problem with other suits.",42757,2
42757,They didn't work for us.,42757,2

42759,"Until you walk, zipper is exposed at the very top and rubs against your skin.",42759,2
42759,It rubbed me raw and I ended up with a sizable cut.,42759,2
42759,Don't know if it was a single product defect but I returned it and didn't ask for a replacement.,42759,2
42760,horrible!,42760,2
42760,did not get the same top in the picture.,42760,2
42760,and its tiny.,42760,2
42760,if you have good size jugs.,42760,2
42760,do not bother.,42760,2
42760,the bottoms were big but that was fine.,42760,2
42760,I wear a 16 in most clothes and a 36JJ bra I ordered the largest size and it went right back.,42760,2
42761,The hat looks nothing like a cowboy hat.. And you can shape it like one but it don't stay,42761,2
42762,Not how I expected bought a small and the skirt was still too big in the hips not at all like the picture makes it look!!,42762,2
42762,the material is cool though,42762,2
42763,Didn't like feel or look of leather.,42763,2
42763,Like space & additional  shoulder strap.,42763,2
42764,Super sexy but falls off easily,42764,2
42765,dick sleeve is way to big.,42765,2
42765,It doesn't support it comfortable.,42765,2

42768,I had to order this THREE TIMES to get a size that fit.,42768,2
42768,"I have never worn an extra large anything in my life and I had to go from small, medium (fit the exact same as the small), all the way to XL in order to get something I could actually get over my butt and zip up!",42768,2
42768,"I was finally able to zip the XL up though I have to shimmy to actually get it over my butt (and I'm not super endowed there) but now the length is not sitting where I had hoped for the costume I was using this for and I'm going to have to stuff my boobs in order to make them fit, something else I've also never had to do since I'm usually a 34 D. Very disappointed in the product.",42768,2
42768,"I purchased this from 2 different sellers, and have no issue with either seller.",42768,2
42768,"My returns through amazon were fast and painless, really thankful this was prime eligible.",42768,2
42768,"I'm giving this two stars because fit aside, I am please with the quality of the product for the price.",42768,2
42769,I took my measurements and ordered accordingly.,42769,2
42769,"Typically, I wear an XS or 0P.",42769,2
42769,"I ordered the XS, but when it arrived I shocked to find it was tighter than skin tight!",42769,2
42769,You could see my belly button ring and the outline of my panties.,42769,2
42769,It was certainly see-through as well.,42769,2
42769,I would only be able to wear it will nude undergarments.,42769,2
42769,"The design was beautiful, but I would never wear something so tight and sheer.",42769,2
42770,Not for someone with a bust.,42770,2
42770,I would recommend for those with A cups.,42770,2
42771,Nice material and style.,42771,2
42771,Really small even for the measurements given,42771,2
42772,Was a nice color but the lace at the bottom was all torn up and strings hanging off of the shirt about to tear a hole.,42772,2
42772,I also got a medium and it was extremely small.,42772,2
42772,"I am 5""3.",42772,2
42773,Made out of soft foam but it came so bent that it didn't work,42773,2
42774,Wish you could remove the cups because my chest is big enough,42774,2
42775,One word for this: yuck.,42775,2
42775,Props to the company for trying to reproduce an affordable version of the Triangl brand neoprene bathing suits.,42775,2
42775,Those suits fit like a dream and are extremely flattering.,42775,2
42775,"However, I guess you get what you pay for - this bathing suit was FAR from flattering.",42775,2
42775,"I have a decently full chest and usually fill out/almost pop out of medium bikini tops, but the medium top of this suit made my upper half look nonexistent.",42775,2
42775,The bottoms were quite the opposite - they were much too tight and gave me the worst muffin top I've ever had!,42775,2
42775,"The suit was cute before I tried it on, at least.",42775,2
42775,But the material is not true neoprene - it is definitely cheaper feeling.,42775,2
42775,Not as flatting as neoprene either.,42775,2
42776,This bikini would have been cute if it wasn't so small.,42776,2
42776,I am 5' and 105lbs and the size small gave me weird fat bulges on the sides.,42776,2
42777,Breaks way to ez,42777,2
42778,Has a plastic feel to it.,42778,2
42779,Flame design looks great.,42779,2
42779,Pants have two different tags sown  on it one says Large the says X Large.,42779,2
42779,"I tried them on, they fit like a small!",42779,2
42779,I'm guessing they are using small children to size for adult clothing.,42779,2
42779,"So disappointed, needed these for an event, too late now.",42779,2
42780,The material is unattractive and fits larger than looks flattering.,42780,2
42781,"I wanted to love this suit, it's cute from the front, but the back is cut the same as the front and might as well be a thong.",42781,2
42781,Definitely not able to wear this suit in public.,42781,2
42782,I got this purse and the zip was broken.,42782,2
42782,Had to send back.,42782,2
42783,One of them torn when taking out of package.,42783,2
42783,No worth the effort of return.,42783,2
42783,More flimsy than originals that came with the wallet.,42783,2
42784,the pictures make the dress seem like the perforation is real.,42784,2
42784,i thought there would be a colorful layer and then the black overlay.,42784,2
42784,it's one layer and when the fabric stretches the dress looks very white/grey.,42784,2
42784,takes away from the beauty and makes it look cheap.,42784,2
42785,Maybe OK for under a dress but absolutely a no no unless you don't mind a shiney see your underwater look.,42785,2
42785,Similar to thicker tights.,42785,2
42785,Don't bother...,42785,2
42786,Fit was terrible.,42786,2
42786,It was missing sequencing on the back.,42786,2
42786,Only good thing was the prompt refund,42786,2
42787,"I ordered them in green for a Poison Ivy cosplay and the color is perfect and beautiful, but they are a little bit small for me (I'm a larger girl, 5'6"" 175 pounds, so I'm definitely not a size small or medium.)",42787,2
42787,I was still able to squeeze into them and they will be usable for my costume.,42787,2
42787,The picture of the green tights makes them look shiny but they are not.,42787,2
42787,They are just a very vibrant green which is what I wanted.,42787,2
42787,I wouldn't buy these again.,42787,2
42787,I would go for something better quality and something that stretches out and bounces back properly.,42787,2
42787,These are cheap and bad quality the only thing nice about them was the color.,42787,2
42788,"Nice quality but no way to fit me, I order a size bigger and still extremely small.",42788,2
42789,"I REALLY wanted this dress to work, but it just won't.",42789,2
42789,"Without quite a bit of alterations, I'm really not sure how anyone can wear this dress.",42789,2
42789,It's shaped like a tube and there's nothing remotely flattering about it.,42789,2
42789,"To make matters worse, it's terribly overpriced for the cheap appearance and flimsy materials.",42789,2
42789,Some of the sequins fell off right away upon taking it out of its packaging.,42789,2
42789,"Based on reviews and just using common sense, I didn't expect anything amazing, but the quality is so poor that even I was surprised.",42789,2
42789,"Overall, the idea of what this dress Should look like is quite lovely.",42789,2
42789,"The materials, although of poor quality still do look accurate to the Amazon picture.",42789,2
42789,"It's the shape, or lack there of, that is the biggest let down for this item.",42789,2
42789,"For reference, I am 130 lbs and 5 ft 5 in tall.",42789,2
42789,I ordered the dress to fit a US dress size 6.,42789,2
42790,"Cheap quality, it ripped right away in the back.",42790,2
42791,Disappointed!!,42791,2
42791,"Only one shoe charges, therefore the lights only work on one sneaker.",42791,2
42791,"My kid was so upset, they worked for a day & half...money wasted...frustrating!!!",42791,2
42791,"Advice: make sure charging ports on both sneakers are operable, before wearing.",42791,2
42792,Not jewelers grade or even close,42792,2
42793,I ordered a 4 for my 4 year old who is average size.,42793,2
42793,"The headband is to small, the shirt fits great but the shorts are too big.",42793,2
42793,"The outfit is cute, she can wear a belt with the shorts but it's not what I had hoped for.",42793,2
42794,missing beads...,42794,2
42795,Average product.,42795,2
42796,"Odd sizes, runs very large, fits all the way down not on knuckle, doesn't appear super cheap.",42796,2
42797,"Not as described, fits baggy... And I ordered small for my size",42797,2
42798,I don't care for the material.,42798,2
42798,"Other than that, it is ok.",42798,2
42799,Too small for me.,42799,2
42799,Have not worn it.,42799,2
42800,The case fits nicely on my phone and seems smaller than the one I received previously.,42800,2
42800,Pros...I get a lot of compliments on it.,42800,2
42800,"Cons are that the print is smaller than pictured, and the ""label"" is already starting to fade/come off.",42800,2
42800,I've only had this case for about 2 weeks.,42800,2
42800,I can only assume that within the next month the print and color on the label will have completely disappeared.,42800,2
42800,Obviously you get what you pay for.,42800,2
42801,"I have no idea who's proportions would fit this dress, unless your boobs are located directly under your collar bone and you have 12 foot legs.",42801,2
42801,The color is pretty...,42801,2
42802,The dress was nowhere near what it was advertised as.,42802,2
42802,The fabric was cheap and the sizing way off.,42802,2
42802,I ordered an XL to be safe and it would not have fit a toddler.,42802,2
42802,It was actually laughable.,42802,2
42802,"Delivery and packaging were perfect, hence the extra star.",42802,2
42803,Cute but the colors starting coming off in 2 weeks.,42803,2
42804,The waist on this was too narrow.,42804,2
42804,Doesn't have much stretch.,42804,2
42804,They would have been better with a wider band and more stretch.,42804,2
42805,Returned.,42805,2
42805,"They seemed flimsy for the wire frames and with the window down, these would lift on face.",42805,2
42806,"The quality of these are AWFUL, I know they are a knock off..but it looks like someone cut the MK with a chisel!",42806,2
42807,"I ordered a size or two larger, but the top was still too small.",42807,2
42807,The 3X was more of an ExL or 1X.,42807,2
42808,Super cute but really small.,42808,2
42808,Can't even get my legs through,42808,2
42809,Comfy but small for the size it says it was,42809,2
42810,"center pleat was to the side, it was like it was seconds but not seconds pr ice.",42810,2
42810,"was going to send it back but an unforseen accident happended,  something got on it before I could send it back, now am stuck with it.",42810,2
42810,I will have to remake it in order to wear it...........,42810,2
42811,Outfit is cute but the material is very thin and not of very high quality.,42811,2
42811,I was hoping to have both my boys be able to wear this outfit but I'm not sure it will make it to the younger one.,42811,2
42811,I like the pattern and the graphic however.,42811,2
42811,May just be an occasional out for for the boys.,42811,2
42812,"The color was beautiful and it seemed to be of good quality, but it was much shorter than expected.",42812,2
42812,"The product image only shows you how the dress looks from straight on, but from the side the hemline is significantly shorter.",42812,2
42812,"I'm 5'7"" and from the front the dress hit me two inches above the knee, but from the side it was mid/high thigh.",42812,2
42812,"Personally, it was too short for me to wear without leggings.",42812,2
42812,"Since I was looking for a casual dress for hot summer days, leggings are not ideally and I ended up returning the dress.",42812,2
42813,A bit too large should have stuck with medium.,42813,2
42813,Trying to contact seller to have it exchanged.,42813,2
42814,"So, this is my favorite case by far.",42814,2
42814,It's cool and awesome.,42814,2
42814,"But, after 2-3 weeks the words faded!",42814,2
42814,I was kinda like really?,42814,2
42814,"I'm not too mad, I mean it was like 5 dollars.",42814,2
42814,I am gonna buy me another one and be careful not to rub on it.,42814,2
42814,I have before and after pics.,42814,2
42814,"I do recommend, but be careful..",42814,2
42815,Doesn't look like picturing,42815,2
42816,Wayyyyyyyyy small,42816,2
42817,ugly,42817,2
42818,I like to wear them under leggings but it shows the whole underwear underneath.,42818,2
42819,Super tight fitting.,42819,2
42820,Se quebro una patia al ponermelos,42820,2
42821,To small and see thru!,42821,2
42822,If your looking for something that will cover your butt this won't do it.,42822,2
42822,Fit like a tank top its very short,42822,2
42823,When it showed up it was a lot smaller than it looked.,42823,2
42823,The handles were really worn around the edges.,42823,2
42823,"Not in a trendy way, but in a cheap looking kind of way.",42823,2
42824,"The product itself is good, the material doesn't feel flimsy or cheap...",42824,2
42824,But Instead of tights with Totoro on them they sent me ones with cats on them and it was a hassle to actually get in contact with the seller to return them!!,42824,2
42824,!,42824,2
42825,The pattern is great and they fit well.,42825,2
42825,Very comfortable.,42825,2
42825,The first pair I ordered had two large cracks across the left lens.,42825,2
42825,I returned the item and received another pair.,42825,2
42825,The new one had THREE large cracks across the lens.,42825,2
42825,"Returning and getting refund, will not purchase again.",42825,2
42825,I recommend getting a higher quality pair.,42825,2
42826,Cheap.,42826,2
42826,Wouldn't recommend,42826,2
42827,"The leggings have a strange fit, slides off the buttocks with any extended movement/exercise.",42827,2
42827,Seller was helpful in that they offered me a refund and let me keep the product.,42827,2
42827,Unfortunately the fit precludes me from using it for exercise or much of anything.,42827,2
42828,"Cheaply made, way smaller than pictured.",42828,2
42828,"Plus, the ring is TINY.",42828,2
42828,"Yes, it is able to be made bigger, but then it leaves a huge gap on the underside of the ring.",42828,2
42828,"I guess you get what you pay for and since this jewelry is so cheap, maybe I should have had lower expectations.",42828,2
42828,I just like getting what is pictured!,42828,2
42829,Too small.,42829,2
42829,Order two sizes up,42829,2
42830,Very long (I am 5'6 and it hit my knee so the model in the picture must be a giant).,42830,2
42830,It is also very baggy.,42830,2
42830,"I was hoping for a bit of a tighter, more flattering fit.",42830,2
42830,Not an oversized t-shirt with a couple holes cut into it.,42830,2
42831,Way to small for :-) fit more like a medium,42831,2
42832,So small that i donated it to the Salvation Army,42832,2
42833,This is not really a long necklace.,42833,2
42833,It's more like a cocktail necklace.,42833,2
42833,"I'm not sure about anyone else, but when I'm going for a cocktail dress look, my first thought isn't dino.",42833,2
42833,It's also a lot larger than I expected.,42833,2
42834,It wasn't what I expected,42834,2
42835,I ordered based on the sizing charts and I couldn't even get this swimsuit on.,42835,2
42835,Disappointed and returned for a refund.,42835,2
42836,"Does not fit to size, Have to size up when ordering.",42836,2
42837,The material is thin and see through.,42837,2

42837,Cute top but made cheaply..,42837,2
42838,I have a pretty long torso (I'm 5'8) and this was still way too long on me.,42838,2
42838,Also fit big in general,42838,2
42839,Love the top but it's about 2 sizes too small.,42839,2
42839,Ordered a XL and it looks like a medium.,42839,2
42840,It is unflattering and to loose of a fit.,42840,2
42841,"Cute but too small, especially the top, it only covers half of my breasts and I'm not that endowed.",42841,2
42842,Way too small.,42842,2
42842,Even the pockets in the jacket are small.,42842,2
42842,Part of your hand is still outside of the pocket.,42842,2
42842,I think the XXL size is maybe a large.,42842,2
42842,"Too much of a pain to return, but what a waste of money.",42842,2
42843,I loved them... Until I washed them and they shrunk.,42843,2
42843,"Not just a little, but several inches.",42843,2
42843,Don't put them in the dryer or order a couple sizes bigger.,42843,2
42844,These don't cover the front as well as I would like them to fit.,42844,2

42846,Does not look as pictured at all.,42846,2
42847,"I was dissapointed with this, it's like a pancho not a shirt at all, you just put it over your head and it's open on both sides, not what I was expecting at all",42847,2
42848,"Poor quality, poor fit.",42848,2
42849,not well made,42849,2

42853,Now we are back to the drawing board.,42853,2
42853,"I had high hopes for these bras, they were the only ones she found comfortable.",42853,2

42855,Very cute little shirt but it was way too small for the size it was supposed to be.,42855,2
42856,Very pretty short but fabric is very sheer and if you have big boobs I recommend you going up a size,42856,2
42857,okay for the price...,42857,2
42858,Runs very very wide.,42858,2
42859,"They are good, except I need a larger size, extra large is what you should order, I'm a 33/34 waste, and extra larger should of been what I should have ordered.",42859,2
42860,I'm not happy.,42860,2
42860,"If you are purchasing this item in hopes that it will give you a nice butt lift, DO NOT BUY IT!",42860,2
42860,You can tell you are wearing it under all kinds of clothing.,42860,2
42860,It gives you a very ugly looking crease right under your butt.,42860,2

42861,cheap appearance,42861,2

42875,"Unfortunately, the holster part was sewn in such a way that it does not hang the way it's shown on the picture.",42875,2
42875,The part of the belt that holds the gun bulges away from the body and it will require modification to have it lie against the thigh as it should.,42875,2

42879,They look cheap and they fall out of my nose constantly!!,42879,2
42879,Plus they're so long that it always looks like i have a booger in my nose when wearing them.,42879,2
42880,Fleece jacket runs big.,42880,2
42880,More like a Men's large rather than a women's large,42880,2
42881,The metal smells terrible.,42881,2
42881,I have not yet put them in due to the fact that I am scared the metal will come off or turn the surrounding area green.,42881,2
42882,The fabric is a 70s style poly blend that I am quite sure will both winkle easily and be filled with static cling.,42882,2
42882,"The color is lovely, but the fabric neither feels soft nor looks flowy up close.",42882,2
42883,It did not fit as expected ran too small.,42883,2
42883,Not that happy with the jacket.,42883,2
42884,You must need to be teeny tiny to where this and best for petite figures.,42884,2
42884,I would like to return it because it doesn't look good on me at all.,42884,2
42884,Bottoms are too small but top does fit but not good if you have broad shoulders.,42884,2
42885,The tie is described as Extra Long but seems shorter than my regular length ties.,42885,2
42885,"Sits about four inches above my belt and I am 6'0"" tall.",42885,2
42885,"I think the ties would fit a high school freshman properly, but not anyone taller than 5'9""",42885,2
42886,Looks cheap,42886,2
42887,Fits really small and tight.,42887,2
42888,awful fabric..... and the belt is for an extra large?,42888,2
42888,Very disappointed and would not recommend anyone buying this.,42888,2
42889,I'm at a loss.,42889,2
42889,I followed size instructions and ordered an 8XL.,42889,2
42889,"I'm 6'1, currently 245 lbs with a 49"" waist and a bad back that needs help while Im building muscles and losing weight.",42889,2
42889,The 8XL was way too big although I went by this products specific measurements.,42889,2
42889,"Wish I could be more helpful, but I can't tell you what size might work, just that 8XL won't.",42889,2
42889,I can tell you it's definitely made for short torso people.,42889,2
42889,"Long torso people like myself had best keep hunting as this isn't just sorta short, it's very short.",42889,2
42889,Probably leaves even short torso people wanting more length.,42889,2
42889,"Quality seemed to be there, but can't really comment as it's going right back to Amazon.",42889,2
42889,Sad because I seriously need a product like this and fast!,42889,2
42890,This shirt did fit as expected but the material feels very cheap and not only that but also the stitching is extremely noticeable.,42890,2
42891,Kinda small and tight....,42891,2
42892,the scalloped edges flop down.,42892,2
42892,Really annoying.,42892,2
42893,It's cute but the bust is somewhat small.,42893,2
42894,I was a little disappointed with this costume.,42894,2
42894,It just appeared too tacky and felt cheap.,42894,2
42894,I would suggest you to buy your own accessories for the costume because the goggles look like a plastic toy from a cereal box and the design of cogwheels on the dress really cheapens the steampunk look.,42894,2
42894,Also you might want to buy a petticoat skirt to give the dress a higher lift because the dress is really flat.,42894,2
42895,"poor quality fabric, not elastic, but beautiful pattern",42895,2
42896,Really pretty ring.. Lost it's silver Grey color in a week and turned orange around the bottom of the band ):,42896,2
42897,"Eh, not impressed",42897,2
42898,No breast support,42898,2
42899,Fits like spandex.,42899,2
42900,Super itchy material even after several washes and fabric softener.,42900,2
42900,"Fits well, but can't wear for very long because it itches like crazy.",42900,2
42901,Poor quality.,42901,2
42901,Very thin.,42901,2
42901,Not going to help during winter.,42901,2
42901,I gave two stars because the fur on the hood feels genuine.,42901,2
42901,Will be returning,42901,2
42902,They are sheer and were not advertised as so.,42902,2
42902,More of a tight then a leggin.,42902,2
42903,"Very thin metal, simple to the point of looking cheap.",42903,2
42903,Feel lightweight as well.,42903,2
42903,Edges are relatively sharp and should have been more polished and rounded.,42903,2
42903,"Was expecting a more brushed look as they appeared in the pictures, however they have a shiny finish.",42903,2
42903,Can be easily bent to accommodate thicker or thinner ties.,42903,2
42904,"This purse looked nice, really like the colors.",42904,2
42904,The problem was it was not designed for right hand carry.,42904,2
42904,"Customer service was very nice about it, but they were rather insistent that the purse was right hand carry and even suggested I just turn it around.",42904,2
42904,"Well, I did not want to carry the purse backward and they did accept my return and did not charge me for return shipping.",42904,2
42904,I appreciated that.,42904,2
42905,This shirt runs small.,42905,2
42906,not at all what I expected.,42906,2
42906,poor quality,42906,2
42907,These are really a joke.,42907,2
42907,I wear between a 4US and 6US in women's jeans and I bought an XL because I do not like a tight fit and figured since they were coming from an online store they may be a tad undersized.,42907,2
42907,They are tiny.,42907,2
42907,I could have given these to my 8 year niece.,42907,2
42907,I think a lot of it has to do with the narrow unyielding waist band.,42907,2
42907,"Now I would not say that I'm a petite sliver of a thing, but I am not an XL anywhere on this planet.",42907,2
42907,Now women's spandex blend undies usually have a tighter fit (owing to the idealistic stretch) but these are just ridiculous.,42907,2
42907,"Further, these came well after their expected delivery date.",42907,2
42907,It wasn't until two days after the expected delivery date past that they let me know there was an issue with the shipping.,42907,2
42907,"All that aside, they do look cute (would have been cuter if I did not have to stretch them to fit) and the material feels nice.",42907,2
42908,"I love Sailor Moon, but the pattern on the butt looks like a toilet seat.",42908,2
42908,"Worse, the armbands in the back make it look lewd.",42908,2
42909,BROWN IS NOT BROWN!,42909,2
42909,If you're looking for a burgundy/brown this is what you want.,42909,2
42909,The bag shown doesn't look anything like the one I recevied.,42909,2
42909,They enclosed it in two bags which was nice but there was no filler on the inside to keep it's shape.,42909,2
42909,"It looks like an old, used handbag from the bottom of someone's closet.",42909,2
42909,The leather on the front is very nice - on the back and sides - terribly wrinkled and creased!,42909,2
42909,I bought this as a gift but there's no way I can give this!,42909,2
42909,So very disappointed in Amazon's quality control.,42909,2
42910,"Quality and design are nice, a bit nylon feeling, but there are buttons on the sleeves that are a nice detail.",42910,2
42910,"Maybe because I am more curvy than the model, this just looked kinda matronly on me, not delicate and feminine as it does on the model pictured.",42910,2
42911,Cape hood is not the same as depicted in the product photo.,42911,2
42912,The metal is irrational g to my skin.,42912,2
42913,This thing is cute as can be but fits like it was for a child.,42913,2
42914,Really well stitched.,42914,2
42914,Not soft fabric like I thought.,42914,2
42914,Stiff material.,42914,2
42915,Too small,42915,2
42916,the chain is terribly tarnished!,42916,2
42916,Not pleased with this.,42916,2
42917,"Gave this two stars,because the stitching was wierd,and the sizing was off.",42917,2
42917,"I ordered an xl,and it was way to small.",42917,2
42917,"The seller was considerate,and work something out with me.",42917,2
42917,"I wish it fit,because it was really cute.",42917,2
42917,"Had to get a refund,and got something else.",42917,2
42918,Way too small.,42918,2
42918,After reading the reviews on here I bought a large even though I am usually a small.,42918,2
42918,The large juuuuust fits and is even a bit too smug on the hips.,42918,2
42918,I will be opening up the seam to make it wider.,42918,2
42919,poor quality,42919,2
42920,"The clicker part of it isn't stiff, making it hard to put in your nose.",42920,2
42920,The actual ring of it I found too small for my nose as well.,42920,2
42920,Was 3 weeks late for my shipping.,42920,2
42920,It's cute though.,42920,2
42921,I got this blouse for class pictures at work.,42921,2
42921,It is very thin and see through and I got navy blue a dark color.,42921,2
42921,"The decorative pattern that's on the top comes down very low, so a cami is needed so that your under garment won't show.",42921,2
42921,Not worth the money paid for.,42921,2
42921,I highly doubt it will last in the washer.,42921,2
42921,I will not buy this top again and I would suggest you go out and buy a better quality blouse.,42921,2
42922,"It was advertised as ""One Size Fits Most.""",42922,2
42922,"It should read ""One size fits those who wear 0-6.""",42922,2
42923,The bottoms fit good the top was so so big and the latches where poorly attached,42923,2
42924,"Cheap, cheap, cheap.",42924,2
42924,Gave this to a stranger.,42924,2
42925,Cheap and tarnished quickly.,42925,2
42925,You get what you pay for I guess.,42925,2
42926,I ordered a size medium for my 15 year old son and it fits like an extra large.,42926,2
42926,I thought the matrial was fleece or cotton but it's thin like nylon..,42926,2
42926,It looks good but not what expected at all..,42926,2
42927,"I was going to get a lot of these pants but they were way to big for my legs ( I where a size 38"") and these are painter's type of pants; rugged, thin-ish pants...",42927,2
42927,"If you like camo cargo pants, get the Match Men's Woodland Military Cargo Pants.",42927,2
42928,The top itself is fine but the bra is to big.,42928,2
42929,They fit a little small,42929,2
42930,The fit was too small.,42930,2
42930,I am a bigger guy and the only way i could wear it on my head was to snap it on the last two snaps of the head band which meant that the actual cloth part of the hat was too small and it just sat weird.,42930,2
42930,That being said the design of the hat is cool and construction is also good.,42930,2
42930,I ended up giving it to my girlfriend.,42930,2
42930,So if you are a grown man you probably should skip this one.,42930,2
42931,Pretty color but weird non stretchy fabric and super small and see through,42931,2
42932,"Does not, I repeat, does not look like it does in this picture",42932,2
42933,The fur makes you look puffy,42933,2
42934,This outfit was disappointing.,42934,2
42934,The skirt was too small and the top was way too big.,42934,2
42934,"I at first thought that they must have sent 2 different sizes, but alas, it was no accident.",42934,2
42934,"The skirt is pretty, the top is see through.",42934,2
42934,What more can I say?,42934,2
42934,Thank heavens for returns.,42934,2
42935,these pretty blouses run very small,42935,2
42936,I could not buy larger then Med.,42936,2
42937,"Material is rough, and it still is very staticy.",42937,2
42937,I hate to have to do this but I guess finding a good quality slip for around $20 is a thing of the past.,42937,2
42938,Didn't work for me felt too much like plastic when on.,42938,2
42938,"Men's sizes, FYI",42938,2
42939,Came in Tarnished.... does not have the word Pandora on it.,42939,2
42940,Foot pad is exceedingly rough and wears quickly.,42940,2
42940,I constantly end up with blisters on the underside of my toe.,42940,2
42940,On the upside it sticks very well.,42940,2
42941,I was very disappointed when I received this item.,42941,2
42941,Fabric is cheap and not soft.,42941,2
42941,6-12 month size is too small for my 50 percentile 8 month old.,42941,2
42942,The seams started coming apart the first time I washed it.,42942,2
42942,"Other than that, these tops fit well and are long enough to tuck in.",42942,2
42943,Not good quality,42943,2
42944,This is really cheaply made.,42944,2
42944,The fabric tears very easily.,42944,2
42944,I wore once and it now looks shabby with snags and strings hanging.,42944,2
42944,Would not recommend unless you only plan to wear once.,42944,2
42945,Did not meet my expectations,42945,2
42946,Cute design buy very cheaply made.,42946,2
42946,Have to be careful that it doesn't break.,42946,2
42946,So I don't wear as often as I would want to.,42946,2
42947,Cute but I ordered a large and it was too tight to wear over a bathing suit.,42947,2
42947,Might work over a cami.,42947,2
42948,"I was so excited for these, but when they came in I was very disappointed.",42948,2
42948,For more than one reason.,42948,2
42948,1.,42948,2
42948,"I did not receive all three colors, I got one blue, and two white/clear
2.",42948,2
42948,"The pictures make these seems very classy and gorgeous, and almost like a real jewel.",42948,2
42948,"In reality the stones look very cheap and plastic-like, and the white is more of a crystal than an opal.",42948,2
42948,3.,42948,2
42948,One of the rings I got was faulty.,42948,2
42948,"One of the white/clear ones was faulty, the top ball wouldn't screw into the bar.",42948,2
42948,"Positive things:
1.",42948,2
42948,"Correct sizing
2.",42948,2
42948,"Timely shipping
3.",42948,2
42948,"Cheap price

Overall I would've returned the product, but it wasn't worth the return shipping price.",42948,2
42948,"I wasn't happy with my purchase, mostly because I did not receive the third ring in black.",42948,2
42948,"I think if a product is advertised in such a way that it seems you would receive all three colors, you should get all three.",42948,2
42948,"I would've been perfectly OK with the cheap appearance of the materials had I received the three rings specified, and all of the products worked correctly/ without default.",42948,2
42949,I had read the other reviews about how it ran small so I ordered a size up.,42949,2
42949,"I could barely get it on, I would have needed at least two sizes up.",42949,2
42949,"I tried to return it, but it was such a hassle.",42949,2
42949,So I decided to just wash it and give it to my sister who is a bit smaller than me.,42949,2
42949,After it came out of the wash  (which alot of the color bled out) 4 of the buttons had fallen out and one of the neck strap had came off.,42949,2
42949,The only reason that it's getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because when it came it did look as cute as it did in the picture.,42949,2
42950,Looks beautiful in the picture.,42950,2
42950,In person it looks like a granny lace pattern.,42950,2
42950,This dress was meant for a Sweet 16.,42950,2
42950,She threw a fit thinking I was gonna make her wear it.,42950,2
42950,I had to go out and purchase another dress at the last minute.,42950,2
42950,Can't return it because it would cost me over $30 to return it.,42950,2
42951,"Purchased in January, 2016.",42951,2
42951,"Broke in September, 2016.",42951,2
42951,Mad in China.,42951,2
42952,It's really not the size that bothered me ... it's the fact that no stripes matched AT ALL ... from the front to the back the pattern was off 150%.,42952,2
42952,"Which also left the hem part white, part grey .......",42952,2
42952,I guess you get what you pay for.,42952,2
42953,It was too big,42953,2
42954,I ordered a small and it's way too big.,42954,2
42954,Very unflattering style even if it wasn't too big.,42954,2
42954,"I'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds",42954,2
42955,"Love the shirt first off, the graphic combines my passions for Star Wars and longboarding brilliantly.",42955,2
42955,However after two washes and two wears the graphic is already chipping away and breaking in little dot size fragments.,42955,2
42955,I take care of it too as I do not put it in a dryer because it is a graphic tee and instead line dry it.,42955,2
42955,Now I am left wondering if this shirt will last ten outings.,42955,2
42955,Bittersweet altogether.,42955,2
42955,If I can modify this post later and present photos I will provide proof.,42955,2
42956,I bought this to wear in the hospital after I have my second child.,42956,2
42956,"The pattern on this gown is very cute but it is way, way too small.",42956,2
42956,"It does not even come close to fitting over my pregnant belly and the fabric is thick, without any real stretch.",42956,2
42956,"I have to return it and the robe, which is too bad because I really did like the pattern and the quality otherwise seems fine.",42956,2
42957,"My son won't wear these, they are too narrow and tight.",42957,2
42957,He has always worn this brand too.,42957,2
42957,Bummed.,42957,2
42958,One bracelet broke within 2 weeks,42958,2
42959,Runs small,42959,2
42960,Not comfortable at all.,42960,2
42960,I don't know if it's too small or too big but it moves around and only gives support for about 10 min.,42960,2
42960,I am a nurse and move around a lot so this did not work for me.,42960,2
42961,Not what I had hoped for...very narrow,42961,2
42962,It was wayyy too big and not long enough!,42962,2
42963,Bug eyes!,42963,2
42963,Is what my teenagers said when I showed them my pretty purple over sunglasses.,42963,2
42963,I asked if its better than clip one & both said no.,42963,2
42963,Sadly returning them even though the dark grey lens & purple marbled frame is very attractive - just not on my face.,42963,2
42963,My large prescription glasses tightly fit inside which might damage the frames over time if I kept it.,42963,2
42964,Nothing like in the picture.,42964,2
42965,Nice quality .ordered 2x fits like and L,42965,2
42966,Not very supportive in the top.,42966,2
42966,It was not flattering on me.,42966,2
42967,"After ordering a pair in a different color that was great, I ordered this pair.",42967,2
42967,I did not take them out of the package until the night needed.,42967,2
42967,"When I did, I noticed a large hole in one of the legs.",42967,2
42967,"I will be more careful, if I decide to order again.",42967,2
42968,Sorry to say it busted in Torrance so many different areas stressed out of whack,42968,2
42969,Sent the wrong size.,42969,2
42969,Shipping took a while.,42969,2
42969,Overall cute.,42969,2
42969,My daughter likes it.,42969,2
42970,"Doesn't sit on your wrist like in pic it scrunches together, still nice though.",42970,2
42971,This was not what I expected it to be at all.,42971,2
42971,It's way too small and incredibly see-through.,42971,2
42972,Does not fit like it is shown in the picture.,42972,2
42972,Material is average and looks odd.,42972,2
42973,Not worth what it cost coul have gotten same support from spanks or gurdle,42973,2
42974,The dress doesn't look like the picture.,42974,2
42974,The chiffon flowers lay flat and are not anything like they look on the picture.,42974,2
42974,I ordered this dress in a pinch for my daughter do it will have to do but it's very disappointing.,42974,2
42975,I sent it back because it was not proportioned properly for my build,42975,2
42976,"Love the look but way to small ,wish I would have gotten more  than one size bigger",42976,2
42977,This is not sturdy.,42977,2
42977,The colors are reat but its not strong.,42977,2
42978,This belly button ring is huge.,42978,2
42978,It really stuck out on my stomach.,42978,2
42978,"After trying it on, I have never worn it since.",42978,2
42979,Though it files as expected.,42979,2
42979,The colour is not good its like washable and fades easily.,42979,2
42980,I was able to get a group picture with them on.,42980,2
42980,Right when I bent down to get something they ripped..,42980,2
42981,I loved the dress but it was too small and I ordered a1X the size chart is wrong,42981,2
42982,"Very large....gave as gift, not happy",42982,2
42983,Way too small - go up 2 sizes,42983,2
42984,I dunno.,42984,2

42986,:(,42986,2
42987,This sweater is very small but nice color,42987,2
42988,Not all of these are the same size.,42988,2
42989,Size is too loose for wrapping around wrist 3 times and too tight when wrapped around 4 times.,42989,2
42989,"Pretty, though.",42989,2
42989,Unfortunate.,42989,2
42990,Runs small cheap material,42990,2
42991,"I ordered this, and wore it under my skirt for a Renaissance festival, however 3 hours in and the top hoop broke off and the fabric tore.",42991,2
42991,"It looked very nice, but it breaks and rips very easy.",42991,2
42992,"The material is nice, but this is GIANT!",42992,2
42992,I wear a size 6 to 8 and I could fit 2 to 4 of myself in this gown.,42992,2
42992,My family died laughing when I pulled it out.,42992,2
42992,"Don't get a Free Size unless you wear a 24+, then it should be great!",42992,2
42993,"I like the mint green in the picture, but I got a white one .which is alright because I like it",42993,2
42994,You can't have hips for this,42994,2
42995,The zipper ripped as soon I received it,42995,2
42996,Can't Stand the material,42996,2
42997,The quality of the fabric is poor.,42997,2
42998,"The pockets, the reason I bought this, were too fragile.",42998,2
42998,I put one potable battery and it broke the pocket.,42998,2
42998,I had to return it.,42998,2
42999,"The quality of the necklace is much worse than expected - the color of the butterfly looks like faded, the golden metal material looks cheap.",42999,2
42999,It is so different from what it looks online.,42999,2
42999,I doubt I'll ever wear the necklace.,42999,2
42999,"The earrings are slightly better, although there is still a small defect in one of the flower petals.",42999,2
42999,I might wear the earrings.,42999,2
42999,"Given the price, I know I can't complain.",42999,2
43000,Way to small an xl is a medium,43000,2
43001,I'm 5'7 and in a size 10-12.,43001,2
43001,Age 50 active..,43001,2
43001,The top was NOT supportive in the bra area.,43001,2
43001,And the rib cage very tight.,43001,2
43001,It might have been made for junior not women frames.,43001,2
43001,I have Nikki tops similar to this style and they fit perfect in all the right areas.,43001,2
43001,You get what u pay for with this product.,43001,2
43002,"Not so effective, not worth money",43002,2
43003,"Turned out to be too small, I bought a medium but should have gone a size up.",43003,2
43004,"Ahh, way too long.",43004,2
43004,If you want long - great shirt.,43004,2
43004,It's otherwise soft and fit as expected.,43004,2

43005,Other than that I loved it.,43005,2
43006,"Ok, not great",43006,2
43007,"Runs too small... had to return... also, really thin material... feels like a slick handkerchief.",43007,2
43008,"This were not the best, returned them... a bit heavy and cheap looking compared to what was expected/others I received.",43008,2
43009,"The color is off, and it's not really like it looks.",43009,2
43009,"Outs merely ok, but kind of blah.",43009,2
43010,"I don't like these as much as the ""undercover mama"" nursing tanks.",43010,2
43010,This is so floppy that it wrinkles up under your shirt so makes you look weird.,43010,2
43011,I purchased this for my friend who loves the unicorn.,43011,2
43011,I ordered XL but it was so small.,43011,2
43011,"It seems like a small size, and also received this package was almost month and half later after I order it.",43011,2
43011,I couldn't make it to my friends BD party but it was way small for her anyway!!,43011,2
43011,!,43011,2
43012,"The ear mitts are a great idea, but only one fits my right ear.",43012,2
43012,"The other one is apparently too large for my left ear and doesn't stay tight enough and falls off, no matter what I have tried.",43012,2
43012,The right one is fine!,43012,2
43013,This is a great quantity for such a good price but there is a reason for that.,43013,2
43013,"Every single day the little ""diamond"" falls out and it needs to be replaced.",43013,2
43013,So expect to change it every day.,43013,2
43013,I'm not rough with my nose or anything.,43013,2
43013,Bummed that each one doesn't last longer.,43013,2
43014,Can't wear it.,43014,2
43014,Too small.,43014,2
43014,Will give it away!,43014,2
43014,!,43014,2
43015,Size is way to small said it was a six no way,43015,2
43016,These bras are kind of small.,43016,2
43016,I would recommend going a size up at least.,43016,2
43016,"While I do like the removable cups that add a little better shape when exercising and running, I hate the tiny openings in the layers of the cup because once you take them out to wash the bra it's a pain in the butt to get them back in.",43016,2
43016,"They usually end up a curled up, misshapen mess when you try to replace them after washing.",43016,2
43016,The other problem I have with these bras is the zipper.,43016,2
43016,"They have a piece of the soft fabric placed nicely to protect you from the bottom of the zipper and that lays over the top of the zipper as well, which is a nice touch.",43016,2
43016,"However, the hard plastic at the bottom of the zipper and where the zipper comes up to the top still rubs uncomfortably when running or working out, specially doing the rowing machine.",43016,2
43016,"The colors are great, the fabric is comfortable and no 'itchy' spots.",43016,2
43016,UPDATE: After wearing these a couple times and/or washing them once the zippers were either too hard to zip up or they peeled apart.,43016,2
43016,I'm disappointed that they didn't hold up better than they did.,43016,2
43017,Don't li ke these but will keep them since it will cost more to send them back.,43017,2
43017,These are definitely made for a man.,43017,2
43017,They are huge and very uncomfortable to wear.,43017,2
43017,I really want some bifocal sunglasses since I need them to read when in my car.,43017,2
43017,"I need bifocals for women that have small area lenses and are dark, not necessarily reflective.",43017,2
43018,"The hat had an inside circumference of about 22"", but the battery box (cannot be moved) is very close to the bottom edge of the hat, sticks out about 0.5 inches and reduces the size considerably (I'd guess it has a circumference of about 20.5 inches if you take the battery box into consideration).",43018,2
43018,Also the material is very thin and flimsy.,43018,2
43018,I would not order it again.,43018,2
43019,The fabric did not allow for much stretch at all so the picture was distorted on my chest!,43019,2
43019,:(,43019,2
43020,I expected the stones to look better than they actually do.,43020,2
43020,"I read all the reviews and thought it would be worth it; however, I am disappointed.",43020,2
43020,Not worth returning.,43020,2
43021,"The fit in between the toes is uncomfortable, like the toes are cut short and makes them too tight.",43021,2
43021,I am a shoe size 8 or 8 1/2 depending on the brand of shoe.,43021,2
43022,Too wide,43022,2
43023,Biggest issue is the material is definitely FAUX --- it is very cheap and flimsy,43023,2
43024,The shape isn't the same as it is in the picture.,43024,2
43024,"It's not as long as I expected it to be, and isn't as fitting to my curves as I'd like it to be.",43024,2
43025,The back ball is smaller than I'm used to with this style earring.,43025,2
43025,They're nice.,43025,2
43025,Simple.,43025,2
43025,Not too spectacular but I've been binge Amazon shopping so I don't get excited anymore lol.,43025,2
43026,poor quality to be a original tshirt.,43026,2
43026,stamp peelling off.,43026,2
43027,The too was made for a TINY C if that.,43027,2
43027,It was cute but no where close to fitting me.,43027,2
43027,The bottoms are true to size though.,43027,2
43028,Only wore it once then it slowly started to unravel before it completely came apart.,43028,2
43029,Does not keep hair as dry as I thought it would.,43029,2
43030,"I'm 5'8"" and I got a M/L.",43030,2
43030,The sleeves were too short.,43030,2
43030,"The way the cuffs are sewn, you can't undo them for extra length.",43030,2
43030,"Otherwise nice for the price, it's just a pet peeve of mine when sleeves are too short.",43030,2
43031,Bought the brown sweater same style and kept it.,43031,2
43031,Returned this one because it was much shorter in length.,43031,2
43032,I'm an adult female.,43032,2
43032,"They fit my head on the sides, but the nose is SUPER uncomfortable plastic on the nose piece.",43032,2
43032,"Also, they're about an inch thick, the gray lense holders should be thinner.",43032,2
43032,Uncomfortable to say the least,43032,2
43033,I really want to love this strap.,43033,2
43033,"2 issues though:

1) The leather stained 3 of my Oxford shirts in the first week of wear.",43033,2
43033,2) Screw on the buckle came loose while on business in first week of wear.,43033,2
43033,I was able to find a watch store with a small enough screw driver to fix it.,43033,2
43033,Resolved.,43033,2
43034,"Sizing was very small, like waif small.",43034,2
43034,Check the sizing.,43034,2
43035,This was really long and extremely thin.,43035,2
43036,I am a size 13 and need to stretch to size 13.5.,43036,2
43036,These are too small even though it says to size 14,43036,2
43037,"U probably won't like it on u, but you may find a kid that will wear it.",43037,2
43037,"And chances are, it WILL fit that kid.",43037,2
43038,COMBO PLUS 1 (BK-BR-CH) they are selling it for little cheaper for reason.. For the fact that before tried it on I decided to wash it.,43038,2
43038,Oh my god specially the Black legging I washed it like 12 times still the water is very black.. destroyed my white shirt.,43038,2
43038,"Please make sure to wash it over and over  to make sure the chemical is removed.. ""DO NOT WASH IT WITH WHITE CLOTHES"" legging the BK-BR-CH all the color comes out when you wash it over and over over..I mean it could be health hazard.... Make sure to wash until the chemical removed...before you put it on your body!",43038,2
43038,NY is getting cold..,43038,2
43038,I will keep it but I will never order it again..,43038,2
43038,I just do not like the quality and when I wash it the color coming out like crazy !,43038,2
43038,I do not have time to consume washing legging more than 12 times... forget it...I will look for more quality leggings.. probably have to pay more.,43038,2
43038,Well you get what you paid for.. so..,43038,2
43039,THIS SKIRT RUNS VERY LARGE AND QUITE SHORT.,43039,2
43039,THE FABRIC WAS NICE AND HEAVY THOUGH.,43039,2
43039,SOMETIMES THESE SKIRTS ARE THIN AND HAVE NO BODY.,43039,2
43040,These inserts didn't do it for me.,43040,2
43040,The arch support is too light.,43040,2
43040,They help a bit but not much.,43040,2
43041,Entirely too small and the white part is a bit see-through.,43041,2
43042,wore it 1 time & already 3 of the feathers are lost... poor craftmanship.,43042,2
43042,make sure the 'circles' are closed properly so the decorations don't fall off.,43042,2
43043,Love the print of the dress !,43043,2
43043,!,43043,2
43043,Quality is fine but the sizing is way way too small.,43043,2
43043,Go two sizes bigger if you want a good fit.,43043,2
43044,Th jeans are much lighter than the photo,43044,2
43045,Will not by again.,43045,2
43045,On the cheap looking side.,43045,2
43045,For the younger crown it's great!!,43045,2
43045,!,43045,2
43046,"Cute, but color not like the picture shows",43046,2
43047,This doesn't appear to be any different than the Chinese knockoffs pictured here on Amazon.,43047,2
43047,I say that because it has the tiny rope across the brim which I hate.,43047,2
43047,"The picture does not show the tiny rope so I feel a bit duped, since this what the Chinese knockoffs all have.",43047,2
43047,Will most likely be returning this.,43047,2
43048,The whole back side of this turned black and the gold rubbed off in less than a week.,43048,2
43048,Waste of money,43048,2
43049,I love the different designs...,43049,2
43049,But right away I picked one that I liked and tried to unscrew and rescrew the ball.,43049,2
43049,It wouldn't tighten at all.,43049,2
43049,Same thing happened to the second one....,43049,2
43049,I wouldn't say these are the best quality.,43049,2
43049,The flexible design is nice...,43049,2
43049,But I don't think I would buy these again.,43049,2
43050,"Just needed some cheap tank tops for work so I gave these a shot, at first they were great the fit was great but after the first wash (on cold and tumble dry) they shrunk considerably, I was able to stretch them out length wise a little bit but then after the second wash they shrunk even more even with hang dry.",43050,2
43050,"Basically, they went from good fit to a 5 year olds size in two washes.",43050,2
43050,Won't buy again.,43050,2
43051,It was wayyyyyy toooo small.,43051,2
43051,I ordered it for a friend and ordered it 1 size bigger.,43051,2
43051,They do not use the size chart that they provide.,43051,2
43051,I ordered a 5xl and it was like an adult small.,43051,2
43052,"Beautiful outfit, but extremely small.",43052,2
43053,"I specifically ordered a larger size, but this shirt is still way to small.",43053,2
43053,"The size must be in Juniors, and not Women's.",43053,2
43053,"Too bad, because it's a very cute shirt.",43053,2
43054,Too small.,43054,2
43054,May fit a child,43054,2
43055,They were extremely too big.,43055,2
43055,Ended up giving them to a friend who was 6'0 and could fit them better than I could...,43055,2
43055,"I'm 5'0, 160 pounds..",43055,2
43055,I should have got a medium.,43055,2
43055,But they were very comfortable,43055,2
43056,"Comfortable, but definitely not much warmer than regular socks.",43056,2
43056,"If you're buying these for cold winter areas, I'd skip these and go for thicker, warmer wool ones.",43056,2
43056,"If you want them for winter in a warmer climate, they might help.",43056,2
43057,"Returned, Not great quality",43057,2
43058,The color was way off .,43058,2
43058,I thought I was getting a red Turned out to be neon pink .,43058,2
43058,Way to short I got a medium and butt hangs out .,43058,2
43059,"I was very, very disappointed in this robe.",43059,2
43059,The picture presents this lovely full-length robe that in actuality is very tacky looking.,43059,2
43059,It is not the 54 inches in length for a large as advertised either.,43059,2
43059,It hits me mid-chin.,43059,2
43059,All of my previous & current robes from Soft Surroundings are 54 inches & hit the top of my feet with a little extra to spare.,43059,2
43059,It's very thin & probably would serve ok as a Spring & Summer robe.,43059,2
43059,I would return it but the company has a very rigid return policy they are upfront about.,43059,2
43059,"Even though I only tried the robe on, never wore it, I am a smoker.",43059,2
43059,I'm fairly certain there couldn't be a whiff of it on the robe but don't want to take the chance.,43059,2
43059,For the price it's not worth the trouble or gamble.,43059,2
43060,I love this!,43060,2
43060,But it did take a very long time to get.,43060,2
43060,They said 7-10 Busniess days but it Took longer!,43060,2
43060,But I got & it love it!,43060,2
43060,I've had it for 3weeks and the Silver part is already coming off so that's a lil  disappointing...,43060,2
43061,They fit as expected.,43061,2
43061,They are not very sturdy.,43061,2
43061,They got a run in them while just pulling them on (like cheap pantyhose do).,43061,2
43062,"I bought this dress for my Daughter's Sweet 16, I normally wear a size 6 but chose to order a size 8 in case it ran small.",43062,2
43062,"I tried on the dress and based on their sizes, I would need a 12.",43062,2
43062,The sides to zip up didn't even reach past the beginning of my shoulder blades.,43062,2
43062,I am 5'3 and there was a good foot in length dragging from the bottom.,43062,2
43062,Sad Panda.,43062,2
43063,cheaply made you can see your whole ass through it.,43063,2
43063,I would only wear under a dress or something,43063,2
43064,No where near the correct size using the size chart offered by manufacturer.,43064,2
43065,It's cute but the links kept breaking off on the first day that I wore it,43065,2
43066,"I got this in a larger size because I wanted it looser, but it was way too short.",43066,2
43066,"I wanted it to look like the first picture, where it's baggier in the stomach area, but it was more like the other picture where it looks pulled down too much.",43066,2
43066,There wasn't any extra fabric to leave it baggy like the first picture would suggest.,43066,2
43067,Hat is ok but not what I expected.,43067,2
43067,Picture appears to have more fur than what I received.,43067,2
43067,Does not fit snug enough to stay on in the wind.,43067,2
43067,Made well.,43067,2
43068,It is not as high as shown I was expecting it to fit from upper waist to lower hip,43068,2
43069,"Cute, but broke after only wearing for a couple hours.",43069,2
43070,Took forever to come.,43070,2
43070,"Zippers won't work, if I were to pull they would break.",43070,2
43070,Was unaware it was junk being made in China not worth the money.,43070,2
43071,Very delicate product.,43071,2
43071,"I feel like I'm going to break them,, they aren't very sturdy.",43071,2
43072,"Extremely cheap fabric, this shirt is see through",43072,2
43073,The printing of the picture is off center.,43073,2
43073,So the symbol goes waaaaay to the right and leaves a lot of black on the outer edge.,43073,2
43073,Otherwise this would have been really cool.,43073,2
43074,The product was way to big I have a 2 month old this outfit is for an 9 month or older,43074,2
43075,Not truly reversible- can't get the buckle to budge.,43075,2
43076,Great to look at until I put it on.,43076,2
43076,It broke twice.,43076,2
43076,I rigged it to stay together but it was made cheaply.,43076,2
43077,"It looks beautiful, but I haven't received mine yet...  might reorder.",43077,2
43078,They were too small,43078,2
43079,Poor quality.,43079,2
43079,You get what you pay for.,43079,2
43080,Much smaller than expected.,43080,2
43080,Never received the mother of pearl clasp opener.,43080,2
43080,Not worth the money.,43080,2
43081,small in the arms and cheap fabric,43081,2
43082,Its a nice blouse.,43082,2
43083,This thing didn't keep time right.,43083,2
43083,It sounded like a tin toy.,43083,2
43083,And the new one I got was used.,43083,2
43083,Wouldn't recommend to anyone.,43083,2
43084,I got this bathing suit not thinking it would be the best but it was worse.,43084,2
43084,The straps on the top kept popping off and the bottoms were very tiny.,43084,2
43084,Overall I couldn't actually use this to swim in cause it was bad material and to small.,43084,2
43085,It is see through and runs large!,43085,2
43086,Very soft but smaller than I thought.,43086,2
43087,"Adorable, but it was too small, I even ordered 2 sizes larger.",43087,2
43088,Really just low quality.,43088,2
43088,It feels like a straight jacket.,43088,2
43089,Tight around shoulders and across back.,43089,2
43089,I am a typical size 4 or small.,43089,2
43089,I ordered a medium to account fir difference.,43089,2
43089,Still snug.,43089,2
43089,Disappiinted.,43089,2
43090,Way too small.,43090,2
43090,I even bought up a size.,43090,2
43090,Had to return it.,43090,2
43091,Very nice pattern.,43091,2
43091,Thin material that wrinkles more than you'd think possible.,43091,2
43091,"Button-band on shirt-front not sewn on edges, but too far in, making even more wrinkles.",43091,2
43091,Would never recommend.,43091,2
43091,Big disappointment!,43091,2
43092,Pants ripped a seam before I even wore them.,43092,2
43092,Very disappointed with purchase,43092,2
43093,Fabric is too thin to last long.,43093,2
43093,Will not be rainproof.,43093,2
43093,"Delivered crippled and wrinkled like you can't wear in front of others, not sure if I can iron it.",43093,2
43093,Contacted seller today.,43093,2
43094,so big and do not compress at all.,43094,2
43095,"length on torso was good, but arms way to short for my liking.",43095,2
43095,Fabric a bit scratchy,43095,2
43096,The product was advertised as size XXL and we ended up give it away to some who could use it!!,43096,2
43096,!,43096,2
43097,I don't like,43097,2
43098,Thought it would have some stretch.,43098,2
43098,None at all.,43098,2
43098,Very stiff material.,43098,2
43098,Material resembles a doily.,43098,2
43098,"Since there is no coverage for top, you have to buy a tube top or wear a nude bra.",43098,2
43098,Bottom piece barely covers private areas.,43098,2
43098,Thinking of sewing a piece of lace to bottom part for more coverage.,43098,2
43098,I bought the dress in two sizes (medium and large).,43098,2
43098,"Couldn't squeeze into medium, but the large fit better.",43098,2
43098,The medium dress will be gifted.,43098,2
43098,I'm 5'3 and weigh 130.,43098,2
43098,"Afraid that when I sit, the dress may rip.",43098,2
43098,Will definitely bring a second outfit along in case there is wardrobe malfunction.,43098,2
43098,"Despite the cons, dress is pretty on.",43098,2
43099,"Well ... you need ""the body"" to wear this.",43099,2
43099,Despite ordering a Large it's very revealing ... if you'd surgery and are petit or tiny then this is for you.,43099,2
43100,Ordered these because they said 18g.,43100,2
43100,Not even close.,43100,2
43100,I have had my septum for 8 years and had gone down to 18g about 4 years ago.,43100,2
43100,This was the same size as my old 16g jewelry.,43100,2
43100,Sad because I was looking forward to using it.,43100,2
43101,I did like the idea of the vest and  liked the fabric.,43101,2
43101,I bought  7 total from your company and others.,43101,2
43101,Very disappointed in sizes.,43101,2
43101,Will not buy again.,43101,2
43102,Regardless of the size being wrong (I ordered larger than normal) the material is very thin.,43102,2
43102,The top has no support at all.,43102,2
43102,That is despite no underwire (yes they didn't say it had it anyway) usually the seams are tapered to the bust area.,43102,2
43102,This is simply one piece of material with some seams.,43102,2
43102,(I hope that makes sense).,43102,2
43102,All in all it's a cute design but not functional for swimming.,43102,2
43103,Could have been a little tighter.,43103,2
43104,Very cheap,43104,2
43105,Fit was too small for my head they need to make one sizes fits all.,43105,2
43106,This dress is NOT the same dress as the photo and it does not fit as indicated .,43106,2
43107,These are regular tanks.,43107,2
43107,"I was expecting compression, since that word was in the description.",43107,2
43107,I am disappointed because there is absolutely no firmness or stiffness to these shirts at all.,43107,2
43107,I was going to wear them as added support for when I work out.,43107,2
43107,But these will not work for that purpose.,43107,2
43108,"The chain is heavier, larger, longer and cheaper than it looks in the photos.",43108,2
43109,The band is to small.,43109,2
43109,The appearance is okay.,43109,2
43110,They were way to small.,43110,2
43110,Had to throw them away cause it's to much of a hassle to return .,43110,2
43110,And I don't believe in returning underwear .,43110,2
43110,I wear a medium and I guess I needed to buy a x large,43110,2
43111,Ordered an XXL and it fits my 10 year old daughter instead of me.,43111,2
43111,Looks cute on her but it was supposed to be for a sz 14/16 lady!,43111,2
43111,The dress it's self is very pretty.,43111,2
43112,does not run true to size,43112,2
43113,"TOO LARGE IN THE ARM HOLES---I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE IT TAKEN IN---

D  SURBRIDGE",43113,2
43114,Size is not on track with pants size.,43114,2
43114,Im a big guy with a 42 inch waist so I figured the XL size being 51 would afford me extra.,43114,2
43114,Not the case.,43114,2
43114,It doesnt fit at all.,43114,2
43114,I guess being made in China may have something to do with it.,43114,2
43115,This top was much baggier in real life than in the picture.,43115,2
43115,"When I tried it on, I felt fat and frumpy.",43115,2
43115,That is not a good combination for a plus-size woman.,43115,2
43116,Came with the remote but does not work.,43116,2
43116,One shoe lights up for a few seconds and stops.,43116,2
43116,The other shoe works well.,43116,2
43116,I wanted to return but my little one won't let me.,43116,2
43116,He seems to think that it's OK if only one works.,43116,2
43117,this is tiny.,43117,2
43117,"I ordered 4t, but it looks like 2t.",43117,2
43117,the pants waist is so tight that I didn't even try it.,43117,2
43117,the shirt is too short and tight.,43117,2
43118,Cant put to many cards in it won't stay closed,43118,2
43119,Pretty top but fits very large.,43119,2
43119,Order one size smaller than you need.,43119,2
43120,Beauty but it is for person with tight cest,43120,2
43121,This is a gorgeous ring but very low quality.,43121,2
43121,"A few months later, I dropped the ring on our laminate floor.",43121,2
43121,The large center stone fell out.,43121,2
43121,"I emailed the company, sent the ring back and they replaced it.",43121,2
43121,"Several months later, the center stone fell out again and is lost.",43121,2
43121,Company does not replace since the original was bought a year ago.,43121,2
43121,I was not hard on this ring at all.,43121,2
43121,The setting does not hold the stone in place well.,43121,2
43121,Don't waste your money on a ring that will fall apart.,43121,2
43122,I'm a small and ordered a large and it's still too tight!!,43122,2
43122,and the hidden inside zipper came off the track immediately - not a fabulous product,43122,2
43123,"First of all, I ordered two different colors and I received the same color.",43123,2
43123,Not only that but it was def too big.,43123,2

43127,too small,43127,2
43128,This shirt runs very small around the shoulders and arms.,43128,2
43128,I normally ware a medium with a 34D bust and this shirt in a large fits tight around my shoulders and top of the arms.,43128,2
43128,The quality is basic and matches the price that was paid.,43128,2
43128,I order a large and it didn't work out I am returning the item.,43128,2
43128,Oh and it's imported.,43128,2

43133,I'm not sure how it  is measured but I can't wear it.,43133,2

43134,They looked awful.,43134,2
43134,Ended up throwing them out.,43134,2
43135,sooooo tiny.,43135,2
43135,If you are a size 0-2 avg height with no butt then it will fit you.,43135,2

43137,Order one size bigger than your real size.,43137,2
43137,I ordered XL but it is not confortable size.,43137,2
43137,It is extending for cover your body but cup size doesn`t extent enough.,43137,2
43137,So buy bigger size than what you expect.,43137,2
43138,"Cute top, fit well, very comfy, but it got a hole in the armpit the first wear, not quality at all",43138,2

43146,The material for these pants is really nice but the cut is very odd.,43146,2
43146,In the rear area is super baggy and the inseam is really low.,43146,2
43146,The inseam either makes you bunch up around the waist or have the inseam at his knees.,43146,2
43147,"The dress is pretty, but I was instantly turned off by the black pet hair that was all over it.",43147,2

43157,Bubbled surface.,43157,2
43157,Picture does not fit inside the moon.,43157,2
43158,Not a fan.,43158,2
43158,It is not high quality and under the arms is too loose.,43158,2

43160,Dont like the material,43160,2

43162,"Of the 3 I bought, this was the best fitting.",43162,2
43162,But cheaply made.,43162,2
43163,Is different from the picture not even close,43163,2
43164,It was okay for a while but the latch was always hard to open.,43164,2
43164,Then after about a month it snapped.,43164,2
43164,Not worth the money but it was handy for a little while.,43164,2
43165,Right side sunglass won't stay in position.,43165,2
43165,If looking down will partially open and stay there until it is pushed close.,43165,2
43165,Keep having to do this every few minutes.,43165,2
43165,Needs magnet or something to keep closed.,43165,2
43166,Shoelaces are of below average quality as the material is too stiff and the ends easily curl.,43166,2
43167,The top runs really small,43167,2
43168,small,43168,2
43169,"I ordered the grey/pink version of this sweat shirt and loved it, so I decided to order the back/white one too.",43169,2
43169,The black one is a different fabric than the gray one and doesn't fit nearly as nice.,43169,2
43169,Not nearly as nice as I had hoped.,43169,2
43170,it shows that this product is true red but it more like orange.,43170,2
43171,Cannot get the clasp to open,43171,2
43172,I need to return this dress.,43172,2
43172,I would not recommend it.,43172,2
43172,It is not the color that I ordered and it is way shorter than it appears.,43172,2
43173,This is actually quite large ( I'm 5'2 and 175lbs)  and comes with a small peice of ribbon that you have to use to lace the back yourself.,43173,2
43173,The ribbon that came with mine was cut right in the middle so it broke as I was trying it on after lacing it.,43173,2
43174,What is nice looking but it broke as soon as I put it on,43174,2
43175,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she rarely caries.,43175,2
43175,She loves the purse but recently the straps showed excessive wear where they attach to the chain.,43175,2
43175,6 months after Christmas one of the straps was almost in two before she noticed.,43175,2
43175,I would assume this purse should last at least one year.,43175,2
43175,Could you imagine using this for a carry purse and have the cheap straps blow out?,43175,2
43175,I need to replace the purse and want something more durable.,43175,2
43175,Any suggestions?,43175,2
43176,They use cheap zipper and came apart when I was out.,43176,2
43176,Need to have extra clothes when out.,43176,2
43177,Top to big.,43177,2
43177,But bottoms fit,43177,2
43178,The product quality is great!,43178,2
43178,Loved it.,43178,2
43178,But it supposed to be US XL.I was buying it for my mom size 12-14.,43178,2
43178,It ended up fitting me size 6-8.,43178,2
43179,It was very cheap and thin material (to the point where everything you wanted covered up was showing).,43179,2
43179,There was also bad stitching (thread was already coming out) was prior to trying on.,43179,2
43179,"When trying to send it back to the seller, it was a hassle trying to get a hold of him (1) and (2) when I finally did get in contact with him, they told me that it would be a waste of time and money to resend it.",43179,2
43179,The seller let me have the swimsuit and was only given 1/2 of my money back.,43179,2
43179,I was very frustrated with trying to get in contact with the seller and they did not solve my problem.,43179,2
43179,There was no way I was ever going to wear it so it was a waste of money and time.,43179,2
43180,Looks like a solid piece but there is no explanation on how to exchange bezels.,43180,2
43180,I thought it would be an easy and straightforward task.,43180,2
43180,Decided to return it and then avoid damaging the watch but changing bezels manually.,43180,2
43181,They don't stay on.,43181,2
43182,Not what I expected,43182,2
43183,The lens are so fragile they scratched up almost immediately.,43183,2
43184,"This top is cute, however it does not fit at all like the photo.",43184,2
43184,Maybe if I had bought the shirt 3 sizes to big it would fit like this.,43184,2
43184,Slightly disappointed because I bought this to wear as a maternity shirt and now I'll have to save it for after baby.,43184,2
43184,I should have read the comments before purchasing.,43184,2
43185,can't really read zoso :(,43185,2
43186,"This product fits as expected, but only because I read customer reviews of other produces from this manufacturers that stated that clothing was way too small.",43186,2
43186,"The shirt looks good in the picture, but in actuality the material feels thin and cheap, and the shirt itself resembles a hospital scrub shirt.",43186,2
43186,"It's ok for what it is and great if you're just lounging around your home in the summer, but this totally fails when it comes to sizing, quality, and style.",43186,2
43187,"Cool concept, I wear a size 7 engagement ring without a wedding band currently so I got the adjustable sized package for when I do have my band and even the largest size option cut off my circulation and made my finger red and swollen.",43187,2
43188,"It is cute but not the photo and runs very small, especially the shirt .",43188,2
43189,I found these a bit uncomfortable and felt like they irritated my csection scar more than helping.,43189,2
43190,This shirt was too small for me even though I ordered a size up from what I normally wear.,43190,2
43190,The style looked pretty good to me but I didn't like the gold necklace thingy hanging from the top,43190,2
43191,This shirt makes me look PREGNANT!,43191,2
43191,I'm not tubby.,43191,2
43191,This shirt bunched in all the wrong places.,43191,2
43191,It COULD be cute...just not on me I guess...,43191,2
43192,My little bracelet just broke for second time.,43192,2
43192,I got what I paid for,43192,2
43193,It was bigger than I expected,43193,2
43194,They're bent weird,43194,2
43195,not what I was expecting when the package arrived.,43195,2
43195,Seems dated.,43195,2
43196,it's a nice big sized bag but the white interior and the quality of the stitching make it look very cheap.,43196,2
43197,I really wanted to make this work but the cups were just so oddly shaped.,43197,2
43197,I felt like I was wearing a Madonna style bra circa 1984.,43197,2
43197,Returned it immediately.,43197,2
43198,Cheap quality.,43198,2
43199,Shirt is ok ok neck and sleeve but the body is too big,43199,2
43200,It is nothing like the picture.,43200,2
43200,I don't have boobs like that but it's like a long John that's gives a wedgie halfway up the body.,43200,2
43200,I bought a large.,43200,2
43200,"I'm 5' 11"" and thin.",43200,2
43200,It was really tight and when I went to put the sleeves on it pulled hard on my shoulders and tried to fold me just to get it to fit.,43200,2
43201,Very pretty.,43201,2
43201,Only two stars because it will lose its lustre with wear.,43201,2
43202,Cheap fabric stretches out easily,43202,2
43203,The lace was missing at the bottom and the button holes were not cut.,43203,2
43203,The coat itself is pretty.,43203,2
43204,Eyes were dotted off.,43204,2
43205,"I thought this product was very low quality, which is to be expected from its price I guess.",43205,2
43205,I don't see this dress working for most figures.,43205,2
43205,I have a pear shaped body with a small bust and a larger bottom (ie bigger hips and thighs) and it fit really loose up top and normally on my hips.,43205,2
43205,"With the fringe, it really just looked like a drape on my body and it was not flattering whatsoever.",43205,2
43205,I also think the picture is misleading because it's only the dress and the headband that is included.,43205,2
43205,Really the only thing that worked out was the headband.,43205,2
43206,Ran too small for me.,43206,2
43206,The neckline I received does not appear as in the photo.,43206,2
43206,The 'lace' edging is more like a soft fringe.,43206,2
43206,"On a smaller woman, this would probably be cute.",43206,2
43207,Not very attractive and fit is kinda strange.,43207,2
43208,very very beautiful but the cut across the shoulders is not proportionate with the cut of the rest of the blouse.,43208,2
43208,"The rest fits fine, the shoulders would rip out & I have small shoulders.",43208,2
43208,Have tried to give the blouse away & the shoulder fit has been too small for everyone.,43208,2
43209,"Quality is decent, prolly up to par with most similar products.",43209,2
43209,Sizing is terrible!!!!,43209,2
43209,Whatever you think you are go smaller.,43209,2
43209,"Measured waist at 34.5 before buying and using the chart that drops down I bought a L, ridiculously huge!",43209,2
43209,"So i used the other chart which is the more accurate one, went with a M, no difficulty to get on the tightest setting.",43209,2
43209,Had to return both and go with a small!,43209,2
43209,Can still get the small on the smallest setting...,43209,2
43210,It fit as expected but it came very late and it said it delivered but it didn't,43210,2
43211,I ordered a men's medium and it fit like a women's medium.,43211,2
43212,Very itchy.,43212,2

43218,WAY TOO SMALL,43218,2
43219,"Really poor quality, thin fabric.",43219,2
43219,There's no zipper in the back so you have to get in it through the neck and it's not very doable.,43219,2
43219,Mine arrived with a tear in the low quality seam of the outer left calf.,43219,2
43219,"Unfortunately, this, for me, was a waste of time.",43219,2
43220,cheap material and you can see where the seams are glued - NOT SEWED.,43220,2
43221,"As others have said, the spring in this is so loaded that it can be difficult or impossible to retract.",43221,2
43221,"As it turns out, it can also be a bit hazardous to open.",43221,2
43221,"After a few uses, I pushed the button to deploy it and it broke apart in my hand and shot the top portion with the canopy across the room.",43221,2
43222,they look so much better in the pictures,43222,2
43223,Overall size is smaller than I expected.,43223,2
43223,And the hands are longer than normal.,43223,2
43223,But it is cheap and the material is of good quality.,43223,2
43224,Not what I expected in the grade of the leather.,43224,2
43225,complicated to adjust,43225,2

43227,Too much trouble to try and send it back.,43227,2
43227,I'll re-gift it.,43227,2
43228,I am returning it.,43228,2
43228,"I thought it would be the same lovely cotton blend as my other Allegra K purchases, but it is all polyester.",43228,2
43228,Way too statically for the dry winters where I live.,43228,2
43229,"i like the design and it looks nice but the way it opens up, it pinches your finger if you're not careful",43229,2
43230,I was not a fan of this shirt.,43230,2
43230,The sewn the buttons right down the middle of the shirt instead of where they were suppose to be.,43230,2

43242,"Wore it for one day and the end untied and fell apart, not the greatest quality.",43242,2

43254,Good luck guys!,43254,2
43255,The neckline cut NOT as the picture advertised.,43255,2

43288,"The bag itself is gorgeous, and came looking just as I expected.",43288,2
43288,"The quality seems great, and the fabric, handles, and hardware all seem heavy-duty enough that I don't think I'll have the same ripping problems some people have had.... if I ever get to use the thing!",43288,2
43288,Mine has the horrendous fishy smell other commenters have mentioned.,43288,2
43288,It's disgusting.,43288,2
43288,I ordered this bag specifically to use at a job interview- the bag came (as scheduled and expected) the day before.,43288,2
43288,I pulled off the plastic and immediately gagged!,43288,2

43288,"I have it hanging outside to hopefully properly air out, and if it doesn't I think I'll have to just toss it.",43288,2
43289,"Beautiful dress, very detail, and somewhat heavy.",43289,2
43289,Unfurtunately the sizing was kind of strange; very large on the chest area but very small on the waist/back so it would not close.,43289,2
43289,And if I ordered a size bigger the top area will be very big.,43289,2
43290,"Size chart for this is a complete, total lie.",43290,2

43291,"I have a 15"" neck, so apparently this isn't for anyone who's not super skinny, but given that the quality isn't great, I wouldn't recommend it even if it *would* fit you.",43291,2
43292,"I really want to love the skirt because it fits well and the material is thick and smooth,  but......",43292,2
43292,The pattern on the seams on the sides don't match up and the skirt is a funky print.,43292,2

43293,After waiting for a long time I finally got the necklace.,43293,2
43293,"I was very Disappointed, very flimsy not long or big enough .",43293,2

43303,The fit is good but the color  and pattern look generic.,43303,2

43303,It looks like the last picture but worse.,43303,2
43303,"I will not be wearing this in public, only my own private home pool.",43303,2
43303,Maybe...,43303,2

43305,Not sure about it.,43305,2
43305,twice my watch has fallen off my wrist the second time I didn't even realize it until I put my boot on and it was down in it.,43305,2
43305,I say this because what if it falls off somewhere else and I can't find it.,43305,2
43305,this is an expensive watch but my dogs chewed up my original and its hard to find a original replacement and I want a metal band anyway.,43305,2
43305,Also it was kinda tricky putting it on its straight were it connects to the watch and my original band curved,43305,2
43306,Not sellers fault.,43306,2
43306,"I just don""t like them.",43306,2
43307,The material is cheap and it was about two sizes too large.,43307,2
43308,"Came in a tight medium, can tell after the wash it will fit like a small, also after one wear stitching along sleeve as come undone splitting the sleeve by the elbow.",43308,2

43314,"They're soft but if cashmere, 10% at most!",43314,2
43314,Too expensive to return (I usually only buy prime but took a chance on these).,43314,2
43314,Disappointed because I bought these because they're supposed to be cashmere.,43314,2
43314,Won't buy from this vendor again.,43314,2
43315,This is so cheaply made.,43315,2
43315,The floral pattern is screen printed on and you can't tell that from the picture.,43315,2
43315,"Also, the shoulders are tight and feel uncomfortable, their those sleeves between sleeveless and a cap sleeve, not flattering.",43315,2
43316,Order big as these are more like children's sizes,43316,2
43317,The swim suit didn't fit right..the top was awkward and not comfortable and the bottoms were small and tight.,43317,2
43317,I think the top would be better for girls who have a larger chest.,43317,2
43317,The bottoms fit but just not comfortably so I'd say order a size up for bottoms if you order.,43317,2
43317,I do not wear this suit.,43317,2

43320,Zipper was horrible.,43320,2
43321,It looks like a moo moo,43321,2
43322,I ordered a 42 inch belt and I received a belt that had 42 inch written on the label.,43322,2
43322,The problem is that its actually 44 inches which is too long and looks retarded on me.,43322,2
43322,The manufacturer is doing a sloppy job here.,43322,2
43323,disappointed,43323,2
43324,"No stamping as shown, to prove its stainless steel.",43324,2
43324,"The ""gold plating"" looks more like costume jewelry purchased out of a quarter machine.",43324,2
43324,I'm very disappointed in this ring.,43324,2
43325,This looks cheap I don't know if I will be wearing them .,43325,2
43325,they were inexpensive but I would not buy this product again.,43325,2
43326,So incredibly disappointed with this products fit :( it's such a gorgeous bikini but the top doesn't fit properly .. At all!,43326,2
43326,I'm not a huge busted woman by any means but I am normally size 4us (chest size 36 B) so I purchased the largest size possible and it's still too small.,43326,2
43326,The bottoms were small which worked in my favor however :) wish they had bigger top sizes and it would have been perfect!,43326,2
43327,Fits too big for sizing.,43327,2
43328,They are huge.,43328,2
43328,"They were a little large on size than I expected, but the design is like they finish on the belly button",43328,2
43329,Contacted company to return BOTH pairs of the same shorts I purchased.,43329,2
43329,One was a size medium and one was a size large.,43329,2
43329,Haven't heard from them at all.,43329,2
43329,"Moral of the story:  measure TWICE, buy ONCE!",43329,2
43330,Large size fits like a small.,43330,2
43331,It worked for 2 weeks when my pre-pregnancy jean still fit and then I had no use for it.,43331,2
43331,My friend who wears scrubs for work has been using this band a lot more than I have.,43331,2
43331,I would rather recommend getting pregnancy jeans/pants rather than buying this unless you wear scrubs a lot.,43331,2
43332,The material of this dress is super thin and cheap -- it also looks a little shiny.,43332,2
43332,"I'm sure it's fine for casual wear, but it doesn't feel like a good, breathable fabric for summertime.",43332,2
43332,The sizing the seller provided did work for me and the dress fit fine.,43332,2
43333,Cute swimsuit but comes in Asian sizes I ordered a large and the top fits perfect through bottom is made for a child,43333,2
43334,I was so stoked to get this for my husband.,43334,2
43334,"I took the shirt out of the package and the image is peeling off, this will NOT last, maybe one wash and it will be ruined.. pretty bummed.",43334,2
43335,"Easy to use, but, unfortunately, found the distance to be consistently long by about 1-2% in comparison to other GPS watches and Google Earth mapping of routes over the course of my first 15 runs with it.",43335,2
43335,It has never measured short- always long and always by the same approximate margin of error.,43335,2
43335,"When concerned about my pace for training, being off by 2% (0.02 per mile) is not ideal as it displays misleading and inaccurate splits that are off by 4-8 seconds per mile.",43335,2
43335,"The look and feel of the watch are great, but it's inaccuracy  would prevent me from ever buying it again.",43335,2
43336,cheap material.,43336,2
43337,"For the price, its cute.",43337,2
43337,"Material is pretty thin, but the print looks like the picture.",43337,2
43337,The torso of the romper was WAY too short.,43337,2
43337,To a point I couldn't even get the arm bits over my arms - and I have a pretty short torso.,43337,2
43337,Def go at least a size up!,43337,2
43338,Looks a bit cheap... Finishing is poor and the lens gets me headache because of the reflect.,43338,2
43339,The xup size is like an a xup.,43339,2
43339,Also it sounds like I'm ripping it apart when I out it on.,43339,2
43339,The color is vibrant but the material is on the flimsy side.,43339,2
43340,"I got these for the ""normal"" sized holes in my ears.",43340,2
43340,The ones you get done at places like Claire's.,43340,2
43340,"Anyway, these are too big to fit in them.",43340,2
43341,This dress was ill-fitting.,43341,2
43341,I returned it,43341,2
43342,Not for women with big boons,43342,2
43343,Had to send them back.,43343,2
43343,Not flattering on me at all.,43343,2
43344,Suit is a good value the only problem is the draw string does not have enough travel to take up the waist when you are between sizes as I am.,43344,2
43344,The waist has very little elastic in the waist and it was stretched put after two uses.,43344,2
43345,The earrings themselves are beautiful.,43345,2
43345,Only problem is that the backs (all 6) do not have holes!!,43345,2
43345,I am keeping them because they have great color and shine.,43345,2
43345,I am having to use rose gold backs from other earrings I own.,43345,2
43345,Disappointing.,43345,2
43345,Like to keep earrings and their backings together.,43345,2
43346,This would've been super cute.,43346,2
43346,"It took forever for it to arrive, and when it did, it was super tight and not flattering at all.",43346,2
43346,I ordered a size up and it looked like I probably ordered a size down.,43346,2
43346,It is cute though.,43346,2
43346,"It is stretchy, but definitely not something you want to be tight on you.",43346,2
43346,"Also, it doesn't hold up very well.",43346,2
43346,"After one wear, the ""lace"" at the top developed holes in it and the seam in the side was splitting.",43346,2
43347,PLEASE do NOT waste your money on this hoodie!!,43347,2
43347,"I was looking for a classy, long, warm hoodie... and this is NOT it.",43347,2
43347,"The arms are too small on me so it doesn't hang right, plus it doesn't fall as long as it appears it would.",43347,2
43347,That could be my fault in not ordering the right size but this hoodie has a LOT of other problems.,43347,2
43347,One pocket was actually made much smaller than the other one to where I can't even fit my hand in it.,43347,2
43347,"Only the hood is lined so it isn't very warm, and the hood lining is made from a cheap, thin material... it isn't thick and ""rich looking"" like I was hoping for.",43347,2
43347,"The hoodie, itself, is made from a cheap material and doesn't look very nice, plus there were strings left hanging all over it that I am having to cut off.",43347,2
43347,"I gave it two stars only because it did arrive very promptly and because whatever the cheap material is that the hoodie is made from, does seem to repel rain.",43347,2
43347,It looks far more impressive in the picture than it really is.,43347,2
43347,I wish I had listened to the other reviews and not wasted my money on it.,43347,2
43347,I will be looking for a different long hoodie.,43347,2
43348,Order 2-3 sizes larger.,43348,2
43348,Very short,43348,2
43349,"Heavy frames, more for men, not what I expected.",43349,2
43350,Ok but not like picture.,43350,2
43350,Doesn't lay right,43350,2
43351,I bought the shirt for a party and was looking for a Chiffon dressy shirt.,43351,2
43351,The front is exactly what I wanted.,43351,2
43351,The back was cotton tshirt material and the color was way different than the front.,43351,2
43351,"In the picture it was the same color, when I received it.",43351,2
43351,It was two different colors.,43351,2
43351,Not what I expected.,43351,2
43352,Material is nice just seems to be designed for a very very petite woman,43352,2
43353,"It is made well, HOWEVER If you order this blazer make sure order one size larger.",43353,2
43353,"If you are tall this is not the jacket for you, too short.",43353,2
43354,Not the soft fleece material I was hoping for.,43354,2
43354,"It fit, but was a bit sung, even though I sized up.",43354,2
43355,The belt buckle was installed backward on the belt that was sent to me.,43355,2
43355,Extremely frustrating and I will be returning.,43355,2
43355,The belt had potential as it looks decent enough.,43355,2
43355,It's thicker than I thought it was going to be.,43355,2
43356,runs a size and a half smaller than what is advertised,43356,2
43357,i read some reviews that said it was small and wasn't long so i ordered a size up from what i normally do and it barely fits.,43357,2
43357,it is not that long at all like it is in the picture.,43357,2
43357,its tight in the sleeves and goes down to wear a normal sweater goes.,43357,2
43357,i basically bought this just because of the length so i am really disappointed DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE OKAY WITH IT FITTING BASICALLY LIKE A NORMAL SWEATER WITH TIGHT SLEEVES,43357,2
43358,Too small.,43358,2
43358,Not true to size,43358,2
43359,Very see through!,43359,2
43359,To bad because it is very cute.,43359,2
43359,Will have to use it as a cover up.,43359,2
43360,The size nice dress but too small for the size xl you need bigger sizes if the regular size runs sneha,43360,2
43361,I like product but it starting to change color.,43361,2
43362,Did not like the Material it was made out of..,43362,2
43363,too flimsy for me.,43363,2
43363,needs an inside pocket divider,43363,2
43364,Costume did not fit right and looked like it had shoulder pads.,43364,2
43365,The fit is so strange!,43365,2
43365,It's baggy on the top and gets tighter on the bottom.,43365,2
43365,I expected something baggy all throughout looking at the picture.,43365,2
43365,The quality and color are nice though.,43365,2
43365,Disappointing.,43365,2
43366,"The logo print is super thick and doesn't look very good, looks cheap...",43366,2
43367,The red stripe is orange red and the binding is red,43367,2
43368,The color is very bright n pretty.,43368,2
43368,"The size doesn't just run small, but double small.",43368,2
43368,If you are small I would order large.,43368,2
43368,"All my stretch pants are xl but lost some weight so thought large, no way.",43368,2
43368,Says 27.6-37.8.,43368,2
43368,It will not stretch even 5 inches.,43368,2
43368,Also the color is not the same.,43368,2
43368,Shows waist band lighter like gray but it's black.,43368,2
43368,My waist is not 37.8.,43368,2
43368,It's more like 36.,43368,2
43368,"Also hand wash only, no dryer, can't hang to dry either,  looks like they will snag really easy also.",43368,2
43369,"I am not expecting a high quality product but when I received this, the product seems
Tonhabe beennoacked before the product had a chance to cool off.",43369,2
43369,It was all stucked together.,43369,2
43369,The printed stars on the skirt is not even screen printed right.,43369,2
43369,It's all stucked together.,43369,2
43370,Was not the size I thought  they would be.,43370,2
43370,Leggings are usually bigger.,43370,2
43371,Totally not what it is on the bottle.,43371,2
43371,It is very short compared to what it shows on the photo.,43371,2
43372,"I really wanted to love these jeans...but alas, there are many flaws.",43372,2
43372,First and foremost they arrived with a very strong chemical smell.,43372,2
43372,Like nothing I had ever smelled on clothing.,43372,2
43372,Even after I washed them they still smelled so strongly it made my stomach hurt and I had to take them off.,43372,2
43372,After a few washes the smell faded (but yuck!).,43372,2
43372,The drawstring openings are NOT reinforced (like buttonhole openings) and have started to rip.,43372,2
43372,For a $50 pair of sweatpants I absolutely expected more.,43372,2
43372,I wouldn't buy another pair nor recommend them to friends sadly.,43372,2
43373,much shorter then the picture,43373,2
43374,After two washes the material began to become ugly with balls.,43374,2
43375,I did not like this at all.,43375,2
43375,Very stiff material and the opening to the bag is small and narrow.,43375,2
43375,I realize it was inexpensive as far as handbags go but it looked and felt really really cheap.,43375,2
43375,Maybe good for a teenager.,43375,2
43375,Returned it.,43375,2
43376,I wanted loose and comfy - it is tight and a bit scratchy.,43376,2
43376,I have fibro and have to wear soft loose unrestricting things to get thru a day.,43376,2
43377,The cutout at the cleavage just way too revealing for large chested woman.,43377,2
43377,Suit fit really well just too much breast showing.,43377,2
43378,"Very poor quality, it's cute but broke the first time it was worn.",43378,2
43379,"It's a beautiful concept, but the fabric is much too thin, the dye discolors when any form of water touches it.",43379,2
43379,I accidentally spilled water I was drinking on it and it now has discoloration there.,43379,2
43380,"Fit as expected, however looks very cheap!",43380,2
43381,I was sooo excited for this shirt.,43381,2
43381,"I got a small, an extra extra small would've worked.",43381,2
43381,"The attached bra on the inside doesn't have elastic so it provides no support, and this shirt does not allow for a bra to be worn with it.",43381,2
43381,Not worth the purchase.,43381,2
43382,I ordered a large as instructed for my size 8 figure.,43382,2
43382,Suit is too small for me to wear and the fabric is very see through.,43382,2
43383,The shorts came in and were way too small and all the pockets can barely hold a pack of gum from how small they are.,43383,2
43383,"My back pocket ripped my first day wearing them, they look really nice but the size and material are not good.",43383,2
43383,The look is the only reason I gave it two stars.,43383,2
43384,I was supposed to receive my plugs within two days of ordering and didn't get them till a week later.,43384,2
43384,"Once I did receive them, there were tiny blemishes in each one.",43384,2
43384,Small cracks that had a black stain in them.,43384,2
43384,I was a bit disappointed with the product and the time it took to get to me.,43384,2
43385,Very cheap looking.,43385,2
43385,I am just going to give it away.,43385,2
43386,"a little short, and not ""fitted"" like in picture.",43386,2
43386,quality is OK,43386,2
43387,"Unlike the picture, this is a very short sweater.",43387,2
43387,It doesn't cover my behind at all.,43387,2
43387,"I'm 5'4"" 120 lbs and ordered a medium.",43387,2
43387,It doesn't have any tags that say the size or who made it or where it was made or what material it's made of.,43387,2
43387,I was expecting it to be itchy but it wasn't at all.,43387,2
43387,I wore it with a longer shirt underneath and leggings and jeans and it looked fine.,43387,2
43387,Wish it were longer- like the picture shows.,43387,2
43388,the stacks don't end up falling correctly while wearing and it just ends up being a clanking mess,43388,2
43389,I listened to reviews and ordered this item in an XL.,43389,2
43389,"I normally wear medium, but XL fits fine with this blouse.",43389,2
43389,I bought the white and the material is very thin and see through.,43389,2
43389,"I will have to wear something underneath, but because of the halter top I will now have to either buy something that follows the same neckline or have the straps show (which pretty much ruins the effect that the collar was going for).",43389,2
43389,"There are places on the blouse, specifically around the collar, where the sewing is unfinished.",43389,2
43389,"It's an easy fix, though.",43389,2
43389,"Overall, I am alright with the purchase.",43389,2
43389,"For the price, you can find similar tops made of better quality in Target and Oldnavy.",43389,2
43389,"I will not be buying this blouse in other colors, but I will also not be returning it.",43389,2
43389,It's cute enough that I'm going to try and make it work.,43389,2
43389,"That being said, I gave a poor rating because I shouldn't have to finish this top and find accessories to make it work.",43389,2
43390,Really sad.,43390,2
43390,I loved this bikini.,43390,2
43390,I got lots of compliments and felt sexy wearing it.,43390,2
43390,"Unfortunately, when I washed the swimsuit it fell apart.",43390,2
43390,I had it in a safety net bag.,43390,2
43390,"When I tried to ask the seller for an exchange, I didn't hear back.",43390,2
43390,I REALLY wanted to love this bikini.,43390,2
43390,":(
I'm 5'7"", 150 lb athletic-built girl, boobs are 34D.",43390,2
43390,I got a medium and it fit perfectly.,43390,2
43391,"Not a good fit for me- too loose in waist, too tight in thighs, huge boot on ankles.",43391,2
43391,Definitely going to return them,43391,2
43392,Very disappointing.,43392,2
43392,34A to 36C?,43392,2
43392,I don't think so.,43392,2
43392,I'm a 34C and I was spilling out of this everywhere.,43392,2
43392,I took the pads out and it didn't help much at all.,43392,2
43392,The model in the pics looked like she had a good size chest so I thought it would work.,43392,2
43392,"It's a very cute bra and seems well made, I just think the sizing is off.",43392,2
43393,Says it's newborn but looks to be at least 3 months or even slightly larger.,43393,2
43393,Not ideal for take home outfit from hospital.,43393,2
43394,Cheaper feeling  than I thought.,43394,2
43394,I thought it was going to be less shiny.,43394,2
43395,I ordered a large and it is s little bigger than I expected.,43395,2
43395,"I am 6'5"", 200 pounds.",43395,2
43395,"Sleeves are longer than expected as well, and I have a 6'8"" wingspan.",43395,2
43395,"Advertised as a cotton blend, but it is 100% cotton, not blended with anything.",43395,2
43395,"Gave two stars because of the price, you get what you pay for",43395,2
43396,"I like this dress but it as short as a shirt in the largest size and i am 5'5"".",43396,2
43396,Doest cover past the bootie.,43396,2
43396,Disappointed and returning,43396,2
43397,color of the embroidery was too bright in comparison to the photo.,43397,2
43397,Didn't like the look,43397,2
43398,"These pants are ill-fitting, unflattering and feel cheap.",43398,2
43398,They got a hole in them within an hour of me wearing them.,43398,2
43399,"I ordered size up as recommended; received XL and it was still to small
looks good though.",43399,2
43399,sending back and trying XXL,43399,2
43400,Cute concept but doesnt sit nice and feels tight.,43400,2
43401,"Too small , could barely put it on and I'm a size 6 .",43401,2
43401,Medium has normally always fit,43401,2
43402,"These gloves are not true to size, so I returned them but still waiting for my refund.",43402,2
43403,This dress is transparent and very small.,43403,2
43403,"I ordered a medium and I am 5'9"" size 6.",43403,2
43403,This dress did not cover my butt.,43403,2
43404,Super cute.,43404,2
43404,Doesn't fit right though.,43404,2
43404,Too small.,43404,2
43405,See through...other wise it would be good...light weight ...,43405,2
43406,This ring ran a half size (or two) too big.,43406,2
43407,looks cheap,43407,2
43408,I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANOTHER LAUREN RALPH LAUREN DRESS LIKE THIS BEFORE.,43408,2
43408,"THE COLOR WAS FINE AND THE LACE WAS ATTRACTIVE, BUT THE DESIGN OF THE BODICE, ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO THE STYLE OF THE SHOULDERS WAS NOT
APPEALING TO ME.",43408,2
43409,It was small,43409,2
43410,It fit perfect the first time I wore it.,43410,2
43410,After washing the XL was basically a medium.,43410,2
43410,It's a nice shirt but order two sizes larger if you plan on washing it.,43410,2
43411,"Would have been perfect, but the larger set of studs was missing a jewel.",43411,2
43412,I was hoping this shirt would be a little thicker and more like a blouse that I could wear to work with a skirt.,43412,2
43412,"However when it arrived it was very thin, more like an undershirt.",43412,2
43412,So instead I'm planning to use it as a sleep shirt.,43412,2
43412,It's not terrible but dissapointing.,43412,2
43412,If I wanted a sleep shirt I would have ordered a night gown.,43412,2
43412,I ordered a size small in tan.,43412,2
43412,The shirt is a little baggy around the body and doesn't lay flat against my back.,43412,2
43412,"So again, this will be used as a sleep/hanging around the house shirt, not a going out shirt.",43412,2
43412,Maybe it looks better in a different color.,43412,2
43413,Nice design.,43413,2
43413,"Poor stitching, poor material (it s the kind of material I would use for cushions!!)",43413,2
43413,It s not what I thought.,43413,2
43413,Design is the only positive.,43413,2
43414,Not as pictured...these are brown and beige not black and white.,43414,2
43415,"Generally the coat does fit ok, but the arms are too long for me.",43415,2
43415,The coat is also made of the flimsiest fabric out there.,43415,2
43415,It's horribly thin and the inner lining is some kind of uncomfortable nylon material.,43415,2
43415,There are loose threads coming out of it from all different places.,43415,2
43415,"If I could, I would send this coat back for a refund, but I believe it came from China and the cost of return shipping wouldn't be worth it.",43415,2
43415,"The one positive comment I have is that it does look fashionable once I attached the hood to the body of the coat, but even then a few of the buttons kept coming undone :(",43415,2
43416,Didn't really care for the way it looked when I put it on.,43416,2
43416,Faux fur was going in every direction,43416,2
43417,The bottom hurts you actually feel the beading..Idk who thought that would be comfortable.,43417,2
43417,I'm knock kneed so my thighs rub.,43417,2
43417,Unless you have a thigh gap I would not recommend this romper,43417,2
43418,Do love the necklace.,43418,2
43418,Can't wait to show it off to my friends.,43418,2
43418,Matches my outfit perfect.,43418,2
43418,THanks again,43418,2
43419,"Sweater is pretty but found a hole in it right out of the bag, disappointed.",43419,2
43420,Nothing,43420,2
43421,the color is more yellow than nude,43421,2
43422,Cute.,43422,2
43422,But the silver coating wore off within a couple weeks,43422,2
43423,Did not expect it to be so small,43423,2
43424,"The quality appears to be fine, but the shoe will not stay on while walking.",43424,2
43425,Very Dissapointed!!,43425,2
43425,Runs large and looks like crap on!,43425,2
43426,The arm and leg bands were way too tight!,43426,2
43427,"The space is great, however, the wrist strap completely broke in less than a month of owning this.",43427,2
43427,I'm not happy that it broke and it is now useless to me.,43427,2
43428,If I was about 20 pounds smaller and had no boobs I think it would fit fine.,43428,2
43428,I am going to donate it to the salvation army because it is way too small.,43428,2
43428,"I weight 140, am 5'5"" and my chest is a 36D and wear a roomy size 8 in my clothes and I ordered the medium and trying to sausage squeeze into it isn't going to work.",43428,2
43429,It fit ok. Cheap material.,43429,2
43429,"Color is neom orange, not light orange like description.",43429,2
43429,Not coral like the picture.,43429,2
43430,"I tried them on and they were a little too small, super long for ""capris"", and looked/felt like a regular pair of leggings so I assume they'll pill really fast (I don't know since I returned it).",43430,2
43430,The leggings aren't see through though.,43430,2
43431,"Cute suit, but way to small.",43431,2
43431,I even ordered a size up.,43431,2
43431,:(,43431,2
43432,I gave this ring 2 stars not because it isn't beautiful it is but as soon as I got it out of the package one of the little stones fell out.,43432,2
43432,I bought this ring thinking I could wear it for a while without buying another ..,43432,2
43432,But  I'm thinking I will be purchasing a different one very shortly ..,43432,2
43432,I would recommend a different ring.,43432,2
43433,Too small,43433,2
43434,Doesn't look nothing like the picture,43434,2
43435,Material quality is CHEAP!,43435,2
43436,Came with all the parts.,43436,2
43436,The jewelry did not fit the end of the needle and I could not get the jewelry all the way through.,43436,2
43437,Fit is perfect way over priced,43437,2
43438,Small.,43438,2
43438,"I  am 5'8"" and wear a size 14/16 with a 42""bust.",43438,2
43438,There is no way in creation that I can wear the XXL off the shoulder.,43438,2
43438,The opening is anout 12 inches wide and will barely reach over the shoulder.,43438,2
43438,I like it so much less than I thought I would.,43438,2
43438,Maybe I will return it for a XXXL if there is one.,43438,2
43438,Fabric is decent quality for the price.,43438,2
43439,"This is covered in glitter.not sequins.so it ""sheds"" all over my pocketbook.",43439,2
43439,Don't like that at all.,43439,2
43440,Wish I could give more stars.,43440,2
43440,"But on my very first use, I encountered some issues.",43440,2
43440,I placed 3 shirts and 3 slacks in the bag for a business trip.,43440,2
43440,"Nothing major, right?",43440,2
43440,"No shoes, nothing else heavy included but the main zipper broke.",43440,2
43440,Zipper came off track with just typical use.,43440,2
43440,"I wasn't expecting a perfect bag at this price point, but i was expecting to get at least a few uses out of it before issues arose.",43440,2
43440,There's probably better values out there...keep looking.,43440,2
43441,"Too small, doesn't stretch as far as recommened.",43441,2
43442,Rerurned,43442,2
43443,The designs are printed on.,43443,2
43443,Materials is not soft.,43443,2
43443,Product is not as expected.,43443,2
43443,Would definitely consider other brands.,43443,2
43443,Never put this on my granddaughter as the material was not acceptable.,43443,2
43444,Great for ugly sweater party but runs very large.,43444,2
43444,Wires  and battery pack a little bit of a challenge....,43444,2
43444,They get tangled and pull the little lights out.,43444,2
43445,The fit seems to be pretty poor.,43445,2
43445,The elastic is so stretchy that your foot slides around in them.,43445,2
43445,I probably should have returned but didn't want to mess with it.,43445,2
43446,"These ear muffs  d  o  keep ears insulated from the cold, however the inner surface should have been much more padded because ears hurt from the pressure, and the reindeer motif pegs them as a Christmas season item.",43446,2
43447,Nice but too small had to send back,43447,2
43448,I order to the guide it was to long and completely see thru might as well not have it on wasted my money,43448,2
43449,Bought this dress expecting it to be red but it is closer to a coal color.,43449,2
43449,It also did not fit and I ordered up in sizes.,43449,2
43450,"Ordered 2 sizes bigger still didn't fit , couldn't find return so got s5uck with it",43450,2
43451,Hooks are very cheap and bend easy,43451,2
43452,Very floppy - hard to shape for fit.,43452,2
43453,Not happy with these.,43453,2
43453,someone else might be.,43453,2
43453,I just don't like the way they fit.,43453,2
43453,Not a fan of the material - it's like a plastic-like polyurethane material.,43453,2
43453,"They are comfortable, I guess, although they can be a little on the large side, but not much.",43453,2
43453,I just don't really care for them.,43453,2
43453,They aren't what I was expecting.,43453,2
43453,Someone else might find these to be just what they were looking for.,43453,2
43453,"My opinion is based off of how I feel about them, not off of the quality of the underwear itself.",43453,2
43453,The material is sturdy and the stitching is good.,43453,2
43453,"I liked the gathered look (in the picture) of the sides of it, but when I try them on, not so much.",43453,2
43453,"They just don't look or feel right to me, and they don't look sexy on me either (of course, a woman might think that I look sexy in them; I haven't worn them in front of anyone yet).",43453,2
43454,This fits somewhat small.,43454,2
43454,Very tight fighting,43454,2
43455,"I didn't think my nipples were that big, but these clips sure do.",43455,2
43455,The clips are fairly small (see pic).,43455,2
43455,"If you want to slide them on, you have to get through an even tinier opening.",43455,2
43455,"I was able to carefully adjust them open to about a highlighter pen width, but then they really only encircle about 3/4 of the nipple.",43455,2
43455,Where is a larger size that will also cover more of the areola?,43455,2
43455,"In the pic, the center of the clip opening is on the mm side, with the slide-thru opening on the inches side.",43455,2
43455,"Sorry, it's count-down style ruler, so it might look like the photo is backwards.",43455,2
43456,"Well, after a shower as a sleepwear, its great, but I thought I bought a dress to go outside.",43456,2
43456,"You cant do it, everything shows, and it looks like a underwear.",43456,2
43456,"Anyway, maybe it is good to dress over the swimsuit.....to be alone in the garden, where nobody except your family sees you....its cheap look.",43456,2
43456,"Sorry, but tastes are different.",43456,2
43457,Disappointed,43457,2
43458,Looks great but had to return.,43458,2
43458,"After first time wearing, part of the rose came off.",43458,2
43459,Looked too cheap.,43459,2
43460,shipped as stated and nice product however it was way smaller than it should have been could have fit a child,43460,2
43461,I tried it on.,43461,2
43461,"The size of the belt is too ""huge"" and looks silly and short of being ""ugly.""",43461,2
43461,No doubt this looks just right for cowboys performing on rodeos.,43461,2
43461,"Personally, the  queer look I got from people seeing a huge belt made you scrunched.",43461,2
43461,"I was attracted by the ""A"" alphabet on the center of the belt not realizing how it would look on my waist.",43461,2
43461,Packaging the item and driving to the nearest USPS to return it is a hassle for me.,43461,2
43461,I will just keep it as a souvenir as a reminder to be discriminating next time you place an order,43461,2
43462,"The band at the bottom creates a ""pooch"" in the belly area that is very unflattering if you have a relatively flat stomach.",43462,2
43462,I can see it would be useful for someone with something to hide.,43462,2
43463,I like the case the only thing I don't like is that it does not have a am and pm slot  I wish it had 14 individual slots  I have to take medication in the morning and evening.,43463,2
43463,I really love all my Vera Bradley items.,43463,2
43463,This is just a personal perferance,43463,2
43464,It didn't fit me.,43464,2
43464,I ended giving it to my son.,43464,2
43465,"I rodered 6 and at least one has a 3"" split in the seam.",43465,2
43465,very disappointed,43465,2
43466,"Did not like this dress, was really heavy and the lace up back was impossible on my own.",43466,2
43466,I threw it out and never wore it.,43466,2
43466,"It is stunning, though.",43466,2
43467,"Beautiful patterned dress, but the neckline is extremely low cut - really not wearable.",43467,2
43467,"I couldn't pin it without it being noticeable, and wearing a camisole underneath it didn't look quite right, so I ended up unfortunately having to return it.",43467,2
43468,I liked it but the sizing was about 2 sizes too small.,43468,2
43469,Too small and too short.,43469,2
43470,I returned this because it was kinda itchy and was way more Grandma than it looks in the picture.,43470,2
43470,The straps were like 3 inches thick,43470,2
43471,cute.,43471,2
43471,changed the earrings to non pierce clips.,43471,2
43472,Necklace broke the 2nd time I wore it.,43472,2
43473,Sooo heavy and could have been more refined.,43473,2
43473,Design was good can't sell it to anyone.,43473,2
43474,definitely not for kids above 5 or 6 years old.,43474,2
43474,quality is in the average.,43474,2
43475,I order size L and I'm usually M dress did not fit me waist too small and refund was only 30% back because its too costly to send back to china,43475,2
43476,Would be pretty but runs 2 sizes too small.,43476,2
43476,At least.,43476,2
43476,I wear a 1X.,43476,2
43476,I ordered a 3X so it would run huge and comfy.,43476,2
43476,It was tighter than you could imagine.,43476,2
43476,Unable to wear.,43476,2
43477,Looks cheap.,43477,2
43477,Only wear at night.,43477,2
43478,Very cheaply made.,43478,2
43478,Was expecting more but I guess that was my fault when you consider the price.,43478,2
43479,"The quality of the blouse is good, and it is as beautiful as the picture.",43479,2
43479,"It is lined and would be comfortable, but it runs very small.",43479,2
43479,"I normally wear a size 6-8, or M-L.",43479,2
43479,I ordered the XL.,43479,2
43479,"It is snug, and I would not call it a perfect fit.",43479,2
43479,"I might be able to wear it in cold weather under a jacket, but the beautiful lace top and sleeves, its most charming feature, will be hidden.",43479,2
43479,"When the clothing item comes with information about Asian sizing, expect it to be much smaller than you would normally wear.",43479,2
43479,"The sizing chart and prior reviews were not as accurate as I would have wished, and I would not have ordered this had I realized the largest possible size would still run very small.",43479,2
43480,"I usually wear a women's small, but ordered a large to have it be oversized.",43480,2
43480,"Glad I did, because it fits as a small would.",43480,2
43480,"Also, the shirt I ordered was orange.",43480,2
43480,The one I received is gray.,43480,2
43481,"This suit fits small on the top, but large on the bottom.",43481,2
43481,The bottom looks like a diaper when you put it on.,43481,2
43481,I don't see how this look could be flattering on anyone.,43481,2
43482,Like the product  but it came apart at the seems about an inch on both sides the 1st time I wased it,43482,2
43483,There was nothing wrong with them physically wrong with them .,43483,2
43483,They just didn't fit me,43483,2
43484,I wanted to see if I could be fancy sock guy so I ordered these Ike Behar dress socks.,43484,2
43484,"The socks look good, fit great, and are very comfortable.",43484,2
43484,Unfortunately after only one day of wearing the first pair they developed what I can only describe as a run in the toe.,43484,2
43484,"That is a deal breaker for me, I refuse to wear socks with holes in them and I can only imagine these will have a hole in them soon.",43484,2
43485,"Loved the glasses, came scratched though.",43485,2
43486,Very pretty design but I'm very disappointed in the color.,43486,2
43486,"By the image, I was expecting a black, dark purple & peach-ish color with a slight sketchy quality to the design but this is red, white & blue with a very solid, pronounced design.",43486,2
43486,"I buy a LOT of clothing on Amazon & infrequently receive items that are this far ""off"" what I anticipated.",43486,2
43486,"That disappointment/frusration aside, it is a soft & comfortable fabric.",43486,2
43486,"It definitely requires shorts/ leggings/ pants, at least for me.",43486,2
43486,"I'm 5'8"" & it doesn't cover my butt.",43486,2
43486,I wear it over yoga pants or jeans.,43486,2
43486,I have to wear a camisole under it because the arm holes are very large but someone with more curves might not need to.,43486,2
43487,"After 3 washes, a portion of the fabric that encloses the elastic band underneath the breast area started to come undone.",43487,2
43487,So I have part of the elastic band hanging out on the inside of the dress.,43487,2
43487,I have a few sundresses from this company/brand.,43487,2
43487,I hope this doesn't happen to the others.,43487,2
43488,Shirt design was not as advertised.,43488,2
43488,There was a huge TARDIS (from Doctor Who) flying through the sky on the shirt I received.,43488,2
43488,I wanted to give it as a gift to someone who is a big fan of Van Gogh but not at all of Doctor Who.,43488,2
43489,Order one size up,43489,2
43490,"Extremely cheap, but you get what you pay for.",43490,2
43491,"FYI, an XXL in this coat is a US size 12--and a very small size 12, at that.",43491,2
43491,"It seems to be well made and has pockets, but it's way too skimpy for me.",43491,2
43491,I usually wear an L or an XL in outerwear to allow for layers underneath.,43491,2
43492,"It is a nice looking watch, but the leather is very stiff.",43492,2
43492,"Not only that, but the hand that counts the seconds doesn't move, meaning that the other two hands don't move, meaning that the watch just doesn't function.",43492,2
43493,It's  pretty but I could not even get it on and I even ordered a size larger than I needed.,43493,2
43494,These are awful!,43494,2
43494,Super thin cotton with no spandex.,43494,2
43494,"Tight around thighs, baggy around calves and waist.",43494,2
43494,Just terrible.,43494,2
43494,Totally see through.,43494,2
43495,Runs too small.,43495,2
43495,Couldn't use it.,43495,2
43495,Will be giving it away.,43495,2
43496,fits really weird,43496,2
43497,Way too Small,43497,2
43498,This skirt doesn't even wrap all the way around and I'm a pretty small person.,43498,2
43499,The shirt gets linty and the pants are huge.,43499,2
43499,The vest also doesn't sit well.,43499,2
43499,Not my favorite.,43499,2
43500,Hurt my daughters feet.,43500,2
43500,Looked kind of cheap.,43500,2
43500,The cork is not real it is just printed on.,43500,2
43501,Nice but too small,43501,2
43502,analog doesnt work at all,43502,2
43503,Feel cheap.,43503,2
43503,Sent back.,43503,2
43503,Another pair of Leveret jimmies faded terribly upon one wash.,43503,2
43504,"These are ok. Not worth what I paid.would not wear in public, I'd be afraid they would rip.",43504,2
43504,One of the rhinestones fell off when I first tried them on.,43504,2
43504,Comfortable to wear at home and looks cute with a tunic.,43504,2
43504,Just not quite the jegging I'd hoped for.,43504,2
43505,"I ordered a size small and large because im normally small but it said order up two sizes, they are both the same size!",43505,2
43505,But the arm holes on the large are bigger!,43505,2
43505,Weird!,43505,2
43505,"The print is pretty, i ordered the blue floral print, the fabric is thin, not of highest quality, you get what you pay for.",43505,2
43505,"The small fit me well, not too tight and dress hit at knee,  i will wear a brown thick dress belt to define waist.",43505,2
43505,"My measurements ; 32 bust, 125lbs, 5'2 and petite.",43505,2
43505,I always wear a small.,43505,2
43506,It falls apart right after I open the package!,43506,2
43507,I own several Mountain Made products and love them.,43507,2
43507,This is the first time that I have a problem.,43507,2
43507,These gloves don't fit right and I am a size medium.,43507,2
43507,The small is way too small for me.,43507,2
43507,My fingers don't stay in at all and the glove constantly moves forward.,43507,2
43508,Did not fit true to size.,43508,2
43509,He bag is smaller than I thought it would be.,43509,2
43509,It does not look a messenger style bad as described.,43509,2
43509,And the color is way more pink than red.,43509,2
43509,I might give it to my niece.,43509,2
43510,"I wanted a MIPS helmet, but this was not comfortable for me.",43510,2
43510,I also found the extra coverage (from the style of helmet) to restrict neck movement in the riding position.,43510,2
43510,Returned.,43510,2
43510,Am going back to a non-MIPS helmet.,43510,2
43511,To small,43511,2
43512,"I ordered these with high hopes.... Don't get me wrong, these are beautiful earrings, but I could not wear them.",43512,2
43512,They would not stay attached.,43512,2
43512,The back had no notch to catch so that they would stay connected to each other.,43512,2
43512,"If I turn my head too fast, they would come apart.",43512,2
43512,This was equal for both earrings.,43512,2
43512,I guess I got my money's worth.,43512,2
43512,A deal too good to be true.,43512,2
43513,Nice shirt but a bit too small,43513,2
43514,"First of all, these are cute like really cute.",43514,2
43514,The bad- they run so small and they are cheaply made.,43514,2
43514,Not only were my feet killing me within minutes but the sole was coming off within hours.,43514,2
43514,Dont waste your money.,43514,2
43515,very short in the length,43515,2
43516,Much to small for sizes mention :(,43516,2
43517,Size ran small.,43517,2
43517,I had to get extra material added in the sleeves.,43517,2
43518,Neck opening is sooooo small??,43518,2
43518,?,43518,2
43519,"the liner is super cheap, and its not teal like it looks.",43519,2
43519,its clearly blue.,43519,2
43519,just.. very blue.,43519,2
43519,"not a completely awful shade, just not what i wanted or expected.i gave it 2 stars because i guess you get what you pay for.",43519,2
43519,the outside still looks decent despite having a water stain and a splitting zipper.,43519,2
43520,It's not nearly as cute in person as it is in the photos.,43520,2
43520,It's sort of flimsy for a swimsuit and ran larger than expected,43520,2
43521,Cheaply made.,43521,2
43521,The top is seethrough.,43521,2
43521,Would not recommend buying.,43521,2
43522,the picture and description of this shirt is not what you get.,43522,2
43522,"The color is not green, it is teal, which was still pretty, but the lace is bright white not beige either.",43522,2
43522,the shirt does not drupe down and bunch up at the bottom like the picture shows AT ALL.,43522,2
43522,it is very square and boxy and no where near the length it shows.,43522,2
43522,Very misleading.,43522,2
43523,I love the fabric and the fact that it has no harsh elastic but my legs do not fit.,43523,2
43523,I have rather large thighs and the panties do not have large enough leg holes for my legs to fit through.,43523,2
43523,I ordered a size 10 in the past and had no problems but this batch seems too small and i can't find these in stores.,43523,2
43524,"First, I really love that it's a non toxic product!",43524,2
43524,"It's also well made, seems very durable yet soft.",43524,2
43524,"However, I got the gray one because the reviews for the white one said it didn't block out light.",43524,2
43524,"I sleep with sound, but have to have a blacked out room to sleep.",43524,2
43524,"Even though there is an extra bit of fabric cushioning that sits on the bridge of your nose, (therefore it should block out all light)...it still let's in enough light to bother me and the gray one isn't dark (or maybe thick?)",43524,2
43524,enough to block all light either.,43524,2
43524,I'd guess it only blocks about 80% of light.,43524,2
43524,"Also, even though it fits me perfectly, it still feels like it's squeezing my eyes.",43524,2
43524,"I even tried wearing it loose, just tight enough to stay on.",43524,2
43524,But when I wake up my eyes are very dry because the cotton was pressed firmly against them all night.,43524,2
43524,"I wanted this to work for me so much because there's a surprisingly short list of organic sleep wear out there for a decent price, but sadly I'll be sending this back.",43524,2
43524,It could be better if it came in black (with organic dyes) and if the nose bridge cushioning was thick enough to block all light and get the mask off of the eyes enough so they can breathe.,43524,2
43525,Top doesn't fit the way that I expected it to.,43525,2
43525,But the quality of the fabric and everything is good.,43525,2
43526,Its huge and did not live up to my exspectation its kinda ugly but if you flip it to the purple side it looks better,43526,2
43527,"It's really fun, but I bought the X-Large & it's too form-fitting, even though I'm 5'0"" & 110lbs.",43527,2
43527,"The material is stretchy, but I wanted it to look like an oversized t-shirt, whereas it looks like a body-con dress on me.",43527,2
43528,I took the advice from other reviews and ordered a cup size larger than what I normally wear and still it was too small.,43528,2
43528,Also hard to get on.,43528,2
43528,I never had a racer back bra that hooked in the back before.,43528,2
43528,They usually are a front hook and easy to put on.,43528,2
43528,This has to be pulled over your head or up from your lower half.,43528,2
43528,Too much trouble to fool with.,43528,2
43528,On it's way back to Amazon now.,43528,2
43529,it was way to small and too short,43529,2
43530,Has visible metal silver zipper in back.,43530,2
43530,Sleeves run long.,43530,2
43531,"I give this 2 stars because Iam not happy with item pouch area longer then the brief it self ,
Iam not small but wow it was a over kill .",43531,2
43531,Not happy with item .,43531,2
43532,These glasses are fairly small and VERY light weight.,43532,2
43532,"So light, they feel unsubstantial or like ""toy"" glasses.",43532,2
43532,The tint isn't dark enough either.,43532,2
43532,Find myself squinting which is the whole purpose of sunglasses.,43532,2
43532,The bifocal works well..,43532,2
43533,Was to small for me so I gave it away,43533,2
43534,This is the second time I bought this style and brand.,43534,2
43534,I loved the fit and comfort so I decided to get them again.,43534,2
43534,This time the material is thinner and stiffer.,43534,2
43534,The fit isn't as good and they are less comfortable in general.,43534,2
43534,Disappointed!,43534,2
43535,the sizing is way off...XL actually fits like a medium,43535,2
43536,"Cheaply made, low quality workmanship & material.",43536,2
43536,Crudely done.,43536,2
43536,"The loop is too long, should be 1-1.5"" shorter than it is.",43536,2
43536,Good thing it is hidden inside the pants.,43536,2
43536,"Until I find a better quality safety money belt for my husband, this will do for now.",43536,2
43537,"Cool looking at first, but the inseam on the bill is not stitched and falls down often.",43537,2
43538,It was not as expected there was no lining.,43538,2
43538,It was like a thin piece of material to wrap around not supportive at all.,43538,2
43538,Lucky for me I don't have big breast but I had to constantly be on the look out for no nip slips.,43538,2
43539,I was disappointed that they have no pockets.,43539,2
43540,Very low grade.,43540,2
43540,Not worth the long wait.,43540,2
43541,Too tight.,43541,2
43541,I will be returning it.,43541,2
43542,Returned because I did no like the front closures at front,43542,2
43543,Ok.,43543,2
43544,It's made a little cheap but sterdy.,43544,2
43544,I hung mine on my rearview mirror.,43544,2
43545,The quality sucks and it broke upon arrival.,43545,2
43545,"However, it was a cute concept and was inexpensive.",43545,2
43546,It was an alright shirt and soft but the material kind of feels cheap.,43546,2
43547,The arms are too small in the XL.,43547,2
43548,I don't like quality of this product for the price.,43548,2
43548,I expected more,43548,2
43549,Fabric was decent but this definitely was not a turtle neck.,43549,2
43549,It is a Cowl neck !,43549,2
43549,"I ordered a size medium after reading the ""size info"" section.",43549,2
43549,It was big on me.,43549,2
43549,"Should've ordered a Size Small, but again that would not have changed the Cowl Neck !",43549,2
43550,Didn't make it a year before the zipper gave up.,43550,2
43550,(Sad trombone) Not best for daily use.,43550,2
43550,"So far, so good.",43550,2
43550,"Decent size, if a bit small on days I need to pack my tablet, laptop and a sweater along with all the other basic everyday crap.",43550,2
43550,"If you carry a lot of books, tech or layers, this might not be the bag for you.",43550,2
43550,Stitching all seems to be holding up well.,43550,2
43550,"This is not made for someone without junk in the truck, stuff in the stomach or extra under the arms, however.",43550,2
43550,The straps are very stiff and sometimes pinch under my arms.,43550,2
43550,It does rest well on my back (doesn't sit on my tailbone).,43550,2
43550,It has LOTS of lovely pockets.,43550,2
43550,However I wish it had a dual zipper for the top pocket because I'm super lazy and having to zip the entire bag open just to get out something quick smacks of effort my elders would chide me for not having.,43550,2
43550,Zippers stick a lot when you first get it but have eased up over time.,43550,2
43550,Leather at the top of each of the front pockets is problematic as it makes it difficult to zip the pockets open and shut easily.,43550,2
43550,But that might be a fault of poor design/stitching.,43550,2
43550,But this isn't enough to make the bag a no go.,43550,2
43550,Not waterproof even a little.,43550,2
43550,But some canvas  and seam spray seal would help that.,43550,2
43550,"TLDR
Pros:
Nice size
Well made straps (so far)
Lots of nice pockets.",43550,2
43550,"Didn't have horrible chem smell when I took it out of the packaging (it's a thing, really)
Durable (so far)
Zippers are metal and are holding up well

Cons:
Day pack with size limitations.",43550,2
43550,"Zippers are stiff and take some tugging to use (but ease with use)
Not water proof
Straps are stiff and wide
Wish it had a side pocket for a water bottle or small folding umbrella

I'll update if anything goes wrong in the coming months.",43550,2
43551,Much too small,43551,2
43552,Cheap nylon from the 70's,43552,2
43553,This top is ok if you wear something under it.,43553,2
43553,"If you are big busted, don't buy it",43553,2
43554,Too small,43554,2
43555,I bought a size down because skirt runs kind of big.,43555,2
43555,It's a good fit but I'm a little set back on the fact that the material is very see thru.,43555,2
43556,It looked ok but the hardware came off after a month and it was way too wide and deep  I was constantly having empty it to find what I was looking for,43556,2
43557,Very cute outfit but fit kind of awkward.,43557,2
43557,"The bottom was a weird material and kind of see through, but the top was gorgeous.",43557,2
43557,Be careful with the zipper as well.,43557,2
43558,The large is not a true large.,43558,2
43558,This dress fits for persons whose not too busty.,43558,2
43559,This was a really nice dress but it was smaller than I thought it should have been for the size I ordered.,43559,2
43560,Broke quickly,43560,2
43561,"When I put this on for the first time, one of the straps broke.",43561,2
43561,poor quality to say the least.,43561,2
43562,It was not like what the picture showed.,43562,2
43562,It was way too tight on top while the breast line below was way too heavy and bulky.,43562,2
43562,Giving two stars b/c of the pretty design on the picture.,43562,2
43563,WAY TOO SMALL.,43563,2
43563,I wear size 4 jeans and they don't fit at all.,43563,2
43564,to big i am short & thick i usually wear med to a large i ordered medium & its to big.,43564,2
43564,& cheaply made the seam around the waist,43564,2
43565,WARNING!!!,43565,2
43565,"This is a heavy t-shirt material, not knit.",43565,2
43565,"It also is short (mid-butt), not long like the pic.",43565,2
43565,"It's still nice, so I will keep it.",43565,2
43565,This seller needs to write a description and take a different pic.,43565,2
43566,Didn't liked the fabric.,43566,2
43566,"Too thin, th colors aren't as shown.",43566,2
43567,Not like the real bape !,43567,2
43568,I loved the way these earrings looked.,43568,2
43568,Really really loved the look but after a couple days 1 of them broke.,43568,2
43568,I Am Not Happy,43568,2
43569,Sizes are off.,43569,2
43569,If you going to order one make sure get it two sizes bigger than you wear.,43569,2
43570,Theses are way to big for new born but they are very nice,43570,2
43571,These were super cute in person but way too narrow.,43571,2
43571,My granddaughter wouldn't even keep them on past the try on stage.,43571,2
43571,Reordered a pair of light up sketchers.,43571,2
43572,"Very small dress, the quality seemed cheap.",43572,2
43572,The dress is not what is pictured.,43572,2
43572,"It had a lot of loose strings, and the stitching was uneven.",43572,2
43573,Was way too big and the material wasn't the best.,43573,2
43573,This is for a thicker woman no one petite,43573,2
43574,Beautiful but made for smaller wrists.,43574,2
43575,The description said it was red and navy.,43575,2
43575,It's orange and navy.,43575,2
43575,Oh well.,43575,2
43575,I'm farly sure that here in Colorada I can find a Broncos fan to give it to.,43575,2
43575,Otherwise it's quite soft.,43575,2
43576,"Bought a larger size after reading the reviews, but it is much, much smaller than marked sizes.",43576,2
43577,"Cute style, had to return...way too small!",43577,2
43578,The material is very cheap and the color looks faded.,43578,2
43578,This looks like a knock off of what is in the picture.,43578,2
43578,The material is more of a night gown material and very thin.,43578,2
43578,I thought it would be heavier cotton and darker colors.,43578,2
43578,I am keeping it bc it is a different style dress and was inexpensive.,43578,2
43579,Sending it back.,43579,2
43579,I ordered a medium and it was snug.,43579,2
43579,I'm 36-28-36 usually wear a size 6 and I didn't feel comfortable in the medium.,43579,2
43579,"If I were to buy it again I'd go for an XL to get a looser, more comfortable fit.",43579,2
43580,These rings were all the same size and did not fit any of my fingers.,43580,2
43580,"They look nice, thin and silver, but they would never stay on my fingers.",43580,2
43580,They unfortunately did not work for me at all.,43580,2
43581,Looks great in the picture but is quite ugly.,43581,2
43581,Very cheap material.,43581,2
43581,Cheap enough that I didn't have to send it back.,43581,2
43582,Cute but I think the fabric wasn't stretchy like I thought it would be and its really small,43582,2
43583,Good,43583,2
43584,way too small.,43584,2
43584,and the beads flip over all the time,43584,2
43585,I ordered a XL and its like a regular L. so the size is way off by the chart...,43585,2
43586,Too large for my 2 year old.,43586,2
43587,Poorly made and does not last very long.,43587,2
43587,This is not a good buy.,43587,2
43587,My wife says it's getting flimsy after only 2 months of use.,43587,2
43588,Way too small & was charged postage to return.,43588,2
43589,The print is smaller than expected.,43589,2
43589,When laid out the tee shirt looks a lot bigger than it is given the small size of the logo.,43589,2
43589,The print is also placed too low from the neck causing it lay in an awkward position when worn.,43589,2
43589,There is also a lack of detail in the sayajin compared to the description picture.,43589,2
43589,"I really wanted to rate it more, but a shirt's power level falls well below 9000... because it's a shirt.",43589,2
43590,Run way to small,43590,2
43591,Is way shorter than looks.,43591,2
43591,Very large.,43591,2
43591,The way this hangs is not attractive.,43591,2
43591,Maybe a smaller size would look better.,43591,2
43591,Buy two sizes smaller than u usually wear and don't expect it go cover low waisted jeans.,43591,2
43591,Belly will show.,43591,2
43592,This product is very see through at least the yellow one is .,43592,2
43592,For going to beach is ok but as a daily dress this dress would not work.,43592,2
43593,It was bigger than expected.,43593,2
43593,"The material seemed nice at the bottom, but at the top was really cheap.",43593,2
43593,It doesn't cover your bust at all and is incredibly see-through.,43593,2
43593,Don't waste your money.,43593,2
43593,Now I probably have to go buy a dress for homecoming that every other girl already has instead of having a unique one from online.,43593,2
43594,It fit okay.,43594,2
43594,"However, it didn't really make any difference in appearance.",43594,2
43594,The tummy tucking part didn't really make my belly smaller.,43594,2
43594,It just added an extra volume to my belly because of the thick fabric.,43594,2
43595,"Arrived promtly, but 34x32 size, my usual, was too small in both dimensions.",43595,2
43595,"Will probably replace them with ripstop cotton carpenter's pants, if still available, which fit fine when bought several years ago.",43595,2
43595,Carhartt needs to standardize its sizing!,43595,2
43595,!,43595,2
43596,Pretty but.. extremely small even if you were a petite asian person.,43596,2
43596,"Not flexible what so ever, does not bend at all, does not rest well on the neck.",43596,2
43596,Sometimes it is very true you get what you pay for.,43596,2
43596,This wasn't even worth a dollar though.,43596,2
43596,Pretty to look at and a nice color is the only positive that I can say about it.,43596,2
43597,I don't even know how I am supposed toput this shirt on.,43597,2
43597,There is no give or sttetch to the bottom of the shirt to even put it on.,43597,2
43597,"No clasp or other opening, just sttaight stiff fabric.",43597,2
43597,Too bad because i love everything else about the shirt,43597,2
43598,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE ITEM!,43598,2
43599,About value for its price.,43599,2
43600,The suit is very cute but please don't put this thing in the dryer.,43600,2
43600,The lettering will stick to itself and ruin the entire thing!,43600,2
43600,Also im 5'4 and found the suit to be a tad too short.,43600,2
43601,Its cute but its a little tight,43601,2
43602,A little bit tight,43602,2
43603,"Ordered a small, WAY TOO BIG!",43603,2
43603,Would've been cute tho!,43603,2
43604,Straps are wide set.,43604,2
43604,Padding is not realistic and shows through clothing.,43604,2
43604,This is my second purchase because the first one I purchased was missing a closure.,43604,2
43604,Ok for the price.,43604,2
43605,"Not what I expected, runs very small.",43605,2
43606,Difficult to tie it so that it looks good.,43606,2
43607,Runs extremely small!,43607,2
43607,The Asian XL/ US Medium was more like a XXS.,43607,2
43607,I had to return it.,43607,2
43608,"The quality of the sweatshirt itself was fine, but the screen print was poor quality.",43608,2
43608,It wasn't an actual screen print.,43608,2
43608,It was an iron on.,43608,2
43608,"The white cross almost looked like a sticker, it was so stiff.",43608,2
43609,Completely smashed in box.,43609,2
43609,Steamed per instructions but shape not right.,43609,2
43610,"This is not the one I ordered and it stretches out all weird, not the color I wanted or ordered, doesn't fit too bad thou",43610,2
43611,Broke within two months of the purchase.,43611,2
43611,This one is more expensive than the similar alternative options in Amazon.,43611,2
43611,You'd think this is of a higher biuld quality.,43611,2
43611,It's not!,43611,2
43612,I'm larger in the bust area (DDD) so I thought the plunging neck would give my girls enough room.,43612,2
43612,However I did not take into account they would vertically use more fabric.,43612,2
43612,This resulted in an atomic camel toe.,43612,2
43612,"And I'm not tall, 5'2.",43612,2
43612,I would not recommend for the overtly busy crowd.,43612,2
43612,Also the fabric and buttons are quite cheap.,43612,2
43612,"On the plus side, it was wedged up my crotch making my but sexier than normal.",43612,2
43613,Giving them 2 stars because sizing was correct.,43613,2
43613,The fabric gets baggy fast though and is not as comfortable as I was hoping.,43613,2
43614,It's short and small so I have to return it.,43614,2
43614,The color is nice though.,43614,2
43615,"Shirt was very thin material, I was disappointed.",43615,2
43615,Ran very small.,43615,2
43616,These are gorgeous.,43616,2
43616,They came broken.,43616,2
43616,I got the superglue to fix I just havent.,43616,2
43617,This dress arrived with the seams not sewn correctly,43617,2
43618,don't stay up on your arm - slide down very easily,43618,2
43619,kind of big for my face I suppose... didn't truly set the outfit to looking like Tony Stark but maybe just slightly  lol,43619,2
43620,After reading over other reviews I decided to order this one size smaller than I needed.,43620,2
43620,It was still too big.,43620,2
43621,Eh.,43621,2
43622,Weird material...,43622,2
43623,If you have long legs it will not fit!,43623,2
43623,It is super cute!,43623,2
43623,If only it was long enough,43623,2
43624,"Beware, doesn't come with the pins.",43624,2
43625,Ok,43625,2
43626,Top that covers breast it too wide spread.,43626,2
43626,You can fit someone thigh in the gap.,43626,2
43626,That is how gapped it is.,43626,2
43626,Mind you I wear a 36D.,43626,2
43627,tooooo big,43627,2
43628,Too small for my daughters head,43628,2
43629,The strap broke off the first time I used it.,43629,2
43630,The dress isn't long as pictured but good quality.,43630,2
43630,Returning because of the length.,43630,2
43630,It actual reminds me of a bedspread.....it's cute though.,43630,2
43631,They look great.,43631,2
43631,The kids love them.,43631,2
43631,They worked well... For 1 day... One of the shoes no longer charges...,43631,2
43631,Disappointed...,43631,2
43632,"Pretty, not the quality I expected",43632,2
43633,These were a disappointment as they are very cheaply made!,43633,2
43633,The swim bottom underneath is literally nothing more than a flimsy piece of material in the crotch area!,43633,2
43633,As these took a very very long time to ship from china I will just give them away and consider this purchase a loss!,43633,2
43634,"If you're anything above a medium in US sizes, don't even bother.",43634,2
43634,And if you are a medium order a XL and even then it might not fit you.,43634,2
43635,I like the shirt but I'll never get to wear it unless I lose 25 pounds.,43635,2
43635,An extra large shirt usually fits me.,43635,2
43635,This is way too small and I am disappointed.,43635,2
43636,I waited so long to get this dress and when it finally arrived I really didn't feel like it was what I was expecting at all (though for $9 I cant complain too much).,43636,2
43636,The fit was OK and the color is nice though not like the picture..but in the pictures and in the description it says cotton poly blend...even on the tag it says that but it looks and feels like its 100% poly.,43636,2
43636,It shines which cotton doesn't do.,43636,2
43636,I showed one of my coworkers and she said maybe use it as a halloween costume?,43636,2
43636,Thats pretty much how this dress looks/feels.,43636,2
43636,Just read carefully before you buy.,43636,2
43636,Some people don't mind polyester but I really am not a fan.,43636,2
43636,If you need a dress for a dance class this might be perfect.,43636,2
43637,Loved the jumpsuit but it was too small and I ordered an extra large.,43637,2
43637,"It wasn't long enough but if I had ordered two sizes bigger, it would've fit just right.",43637,2
43638,Quality I was expecting but not the shape I ordered.,43638,2
43638,I wanted the rectangular frame and instead received round.,43638,2
43639,"I ordered 11/29, arrived 12/23, sent from China.",43639,2
43639,The Men's Medium I ordered fit's like a Woman's Medium.,43639,2
43639,"I would order an XL, for 5'8"", 145lb boy to leave a little room in case it shrunk.",43639,2
43639,"The print is speckled light grey, NOT WHITE, and there is a printing flaw by the head.",43639,2
43639,"Not worth $ to mail back, so will have to give it as a gift.",43639,2
43639,Not worth the risk of ordering again.,43639,2
43640,not good quality,43640,2
43641,It looked more elegant in the picture.,43641,2
43641,I don't really like it when I saw it.,43641,2
43642,SUPER tiny.,43642,2
43642,Wouldn't fit a baby older than 12 months.,43642,2
43642,"My boys are big too I guess, 18 months and 3 years but I can barely even get them on their fingers, they definitely don't cover their whole hands.",43642,2
43642,Great quality though and if they were bigger I would give them 5 stars.,43642,2
43642,I love that they have the individual fingers and they're super soft.,43642,2
43642,The big pack is nice too (we lose gloves like crazy).,43642,2
43642,If you're looking for gloves for a baby: yes.,43642,2
43642,Toddler: No.,43642,2
43642,A bit misleading in the title and description that way.,43642,2
43643,not good quality,43643,2
43644,I ended up returning this as it was too tight in the check.,43644,2
43644,I am a 40 D and it was really snug in a size 14.,43644,2
43644,The material was soft and flowing like the picture shows.,43644,2
43644,It is a muted grey color.,43644,2
43645,Garbage,43645,2
43646,"The material is nice, but the shape of the shirt is not like the photo.",43646,2
43646,It's very straight cut sort of like a t shirt.,43646,2
43646,I didn't like it.,43646,2
43646,It ships from China so there's no sense in returning,43646,2
43647,"I ordered this for the clear back strap, unfortunately, it did not come with the clear back strap.",43647,2
43647,I can't use it with my dress.,43647,2
43647,I did try it on with the nude colored strap that it came with and it seems quite comfortable and supportive.,43647,2
43647,I am usually a 34 C and I ordered the D cup per the chart in the images.,43647,2
43647,It fits well.,43647,2
43648,Love the designs on the fabric but the proportions are off.,43648,2
43648,"I am 5'5"", 115 lbs, 35.5 bust, 29 waist.",43648,2
43648,"Based on reviews, I sized up to a large which was about the right size, tho the sleeves were snug (comfortable, but no room to spare, with nothing underneath) and the body was loose.",43648,2
43648,"I got a color called Rose, which is actually a very pale peach color.",43648,2
43648,"If the fabric had some stretch to it I could size down, get a slimmer fit thru the body and still be able to get into the sleeves, but this is not a stretch fabric.",43648,2
43649,"Way to small, I ordered a large and couldn't get them over my knees.",43649,2
43649,I'm a size 10!,43649,2
43650,I was so excited to order and recieve this outfit but it did not live up to the hype.,43650,2
43650,Poor quality.,43650,2
43650,It fits weird too.,43650,2
43650,Idk exactly how to describe it other than it was not as expected.,43650,2
43651,"It was cute, but waaaay too small and I ordered a size above what I normally order to be sure.",43651,2
43651,"It was also much shorter than I expected, and made very thinly so it didn't really feel like I was wearing anything.",43651,2
43652,"Very thin, and very short.",43652,2
43652,"Hits at waist, definately size up.",43652,2
43653,"the sleeves are really really small, can not wear with such small sleeves, everything else is great, and can not return because from china...wish I knew sleeves were so tiny around, if you are not stick thin you can not wear this",43653,2
43654,Could be better.,43654,2
43654,Still wearable,43654,2
43655,Way too small!,43655,2
43656,"These are made out of a gross material, and not shiny like in the picture.",43656,2
43656,Plus they were way too small.,43656,2
43656,I don't recommend buying these at all.,43656,2
43657,It was too big for me,43657,2
43658,Did not like the color and sent them back.,43658,2
43659,"I did not like, he is not expecting material",43659,2
43660,it was way too small,43660,2
43661,Runs way small.,43661,2
43661,Cheap thin fabric,43661,2
43662,ok but the material gets un done and soo i gotta sew it all again,43662,2
43663,Really small and not a true nursing top.,43663,2
43663,Does not open or fold over comfortably.,43663,2
43663,Small in midsection but huge in the chest area.,43663,2
43664,"Overall the top was an okay fit, could have been better.",43664,2
43664,"The bottom was to large, but again I'm top heavy and average on the bottom.",43664,2
43665,"SO neat, but they won't fit me at all.",43665,2
43665,I'm 5'7 and 135lbs :( Too small.,43665,2
43666,Really small fit,43666,2
43667,I got the bag but it was the wrong color.,43667,2
43667,I wanted the gray and receive a tan.,43667,2
43668,This was too thin and flimsy for my needs.,43668,2
43668,I think it'd be okay if you just want to wear it under your clothes to appear to have a more hourglass figure when you go out.,43668,2
43668,"But if you want to train your waist or wear it working out, buy a more expensive brand.",43668,2
43668,Consider this too... waist-trainers are hard to buy on the internet.,43668,2
43668,There are so many options in size and style and your needs.,43668,2
43668,"If there's a waist-trainer store within driving distance, go there.",43668,2
43669,I guess I should have figured it out - but from the pictures in the listing I'd expected these to be rather small.,43669,2
43669,But they are huge and kinda gaudy.,43669,2
43669,I gave them away to the child next door.,43669,2
43670,Handles broke after just a few months.,43670,2
43671,Myself nor my friends could not figure out how to put the top on even after reading the instructions several times.,43671,2
43671,It was also too small.,43671,2
43671,"I ended up returning it, cheap material too",43671,2
43672,Very cheap material and zippers.,43672,2
43672,Its nice looking but will not ask last long at all.,43672,2
43672,Very disappointed in quality .,43672,2
43673,Swords are a bit scuffed and elicidator has a stuby point and some of the colors are off and a gem in Lambent light is missing,43673,2
43674,Cheaply made.,43674,2
43674,"No sound effects,  only a dim light.",43674,2
43674,Not bright at all.,43674,2
43674,Too pricey for the quality.,43674,2
43675,not for me,43675,2
43676,Wrong size,43676,2
43677,I think the front part is pretty ugly and super low cheap quality.,43677,2
43677,Awkwardly made and nothing like the picture.,43677,2
43678,Fit was very good but the items were discoloured as though some parts were faded,43678,2
43679,"I ordered a regular size (as opposed to narrow or wide) and figured i would be okay, because I have very narrow feet, but I like some room in the tow box.",43679,2
43679,The pair I received were INCREDIBLY difficult to get on because they were so narrow.,43679,2
43679,"I do not know that any amount of stretching these out will make them comfortable, and I'm super bummed about it.",43679,2
43680,"Quality not as expected,  but fine for casual wear....",43680,2
43681,"Was VERY short for the size, could be worn as a shirt.",43681,2
43682,"The sleeves were too tight and I couldn't bend my arms, the cloth is different from the picture and it is itchy",43682,2
43683,"Very cheap made, I wish I knew a place that made real quality watches in owl jackets...",43683,2
43684,no exactly all sizes fit.,43684,2
43684,if you are over an general size 8 these are going to be too small,43684,2
43685,"These are beautiful, strong metal non-piercing nipple rings.",43685,2
43685,"However I couldn't use them, I am a 38 DDD and was really hoping to surprise my husband with something special, however the hoop is far too small for average size nipples, as a joke i had my husband try it on and it fit him perfectly which was hilarious and sad at the same time.",43685,2
43685,If you have small nipples then these are perfect but they won't fit average to large.,43685,2
43686,Cute but runs small,43686,2
43687,No,43687,2
43688,The crotch is really low fits weird.,43688,2
43689,Runs really small.,43689,2
43690,Fit was pretty good if a bit large; they were sold out of 10 so I took a 14 and used a belt.,43690,2
43690,The pattern is really nice.,43690,2
43690,"However, I wore the pants out for a few hours and the inner thighs pilled SEVERELY and frayed at the seams.",43690,2
43690,They're going back.,43690,2
43691,Cheaply made.,43691,2
43691,Hard to put the strap on.,43691,2
43692,I was so excited for this shirt!,43692,2
43692,It was perfect for what I was looking for.,43692,2
43692,"When I arrived, however, I laughed.",43692,2
43692,"I sized up to an XL to make sure it was roomy, and this was NOT.",43692,2
43692,I could barely get it on.,43692,2
43692,"It also was a belly shirt - no way this could ever pass as a tunic length, unless you put it on a 4 yr old.",43692,2
43692,It didn't even reach the top of my jeans.,43692,2
43692,"I don't know if I was sent the wrong style, or this was advertised wrong, but I'm extremely disappointed.",43692,2
43692,I have contacted the seller and am waiting for a response.,43692,2
43693,this was NOT a pencil skirt!,43693,2
43693,it was a regular fitted mini skirt and nothing like id expected.,43693,2
43693,"If it were a BIT longer and went in towards the bottom, it could possibly be considered a pencil skirt but it doesn't.",43693,2
43693,Such a disappointment since I wanted to wear it for my birthday.,43693,2
43694,It wasn't what I wanted.,43694,2
43694,"Too big, but I got a refund wit no trouble.",43694,2
43694,This is more like a wallet than a credit card holder.,43694,2
43695,"It looks very cool, but it's very cheap!",43695,2
43695,If they would invest an extra 50 cents into making a better clasp this product would be totally worth it!,43695,2
43695,"But Alas, my GF wore this for less than a day before the clasp broke and it became completely worthless.",43695,2
43695,Save your money if you intend on wearing this for longer than a few hrs.,43695,2
43696,looks cheap..but it was,43696,2
43697,Nice but very big.,43697,2
43698,"I got it and ended up giving away, the cup size is way too small, double extra large should have at least a d sized cup and the cup is more of a b sized at best.",43698,2
43698,Color is great just wish it would actually fit as I did check the sizing chart and measure myself before placing the order,43698,2
43699,did not look like the picture i was disappointed so i sent it back !,43699,2
43700,"The straps aren't adjustable, makes it a little difficult to put on and afraid they will snap.",43700,2
43700,"The entire dress is sheerror see through fabric, best to wear as a swimsuit cover.",43700,2
43701,Such a cute dress but it is WAY too small.,43701,2
43702,Item broke when tried to put on.... :(,43702,2
43703,Too small.,43703,2
43703,I cannot wear it so return is the answer.,43703,2
43704,Fugly colors.,43704,2
43704,"So bad I may not even wear them, even though they don't show.",43704,2
43704,NOT as shown in the picture.,43704,2
43705,Looks nothing like the picture .,43705,2
43705,Thinking about returning it,43705,2
43706,"Fast delivery r and they're adorable, but they are way small.",43706,2
43706,They keep falling out of my ear!,43706,2
43707,"Too long, the waist is too large and the material is not very nice.",43707,2
43707,There is a funny flap in the pocket that I don't like either.,43707,2
43707,They just look a little silly.,43707,2
43707,I feel like I look like a middle schooler wearing them.,43707,2
43707,That is probably the last thing in the world I want to feel like.,43707,2
43708,"Difficult to set , my grand daughter desperately wanted it.",43708,2
43708,"I would have returned it, because I feel it was very cheaply made and certainly priced too high for such a poor quality item.",43708,2
43708,Pass on purchasing this.,43708,2
43709,Sent back did not fit,43709,2
43710,"Weird fit....collar is very small, doesn't make it around neck, sits back on neck...., sleeves short, top/body part very large and there are pockets which were not visible in any pic I saw.",43710,2
43711,These are incredibly tight.,43711,2
43711,I read some reviews by people claiming they have large heads and these fit great.,43711,2
43711,"Maybe for long, narrow heads...",43711,2
43711,Mine is round and big.,43711,2
43711,"I'm 110lb, 5'5"" female and I wear male sized head gear ...",43711,2
43711,These are meant for children or adults with razor thin heads.,43711,2
43712,for the very short person,43712,2
43713,I feel so conflicted in giving this review.,43713,2
43713,The pros?,43713,2
43713,The shirt really complements my figure.,43713,2
43713,It's clingy in the right spots.,43713,2
43713,"The neckline is a bit plunging, so unless you put a camisole or tank underneath, your girls will be on display.",43713,2
43713,"The pockets on the chest are a nice addition, too.",43713,2
43713,"The material is thin, but that's good in the spring and fall.",43713,2
43713,"This blouse is quite long on me (I'm 5'5"" and I can easily pull it down below my hip) and I prefer that.",43713,2
43713,The cons?,43713,2
43713,This is going to be long.,43713,2
43713,The sizing is way off.,43713,2
43713,"I'm normally a large, sometimes an XL.",43713,2
43713,I ordered a 2XL and it fits well.,43713,2
43713,I compared this blouse to other large and XL shirts in my closet and I'd say it's a small-ish XL or comparable to a generous large.,43713,2
43713,"The material is very stretchy, but the fit will be ""tight,"" so order up at least one size, maybe two, depending on what you want.",43713,2
43713,The workmanship is poor.,43713,2
43713,"As I was pulling the sleeve off my arm, I heard a tearing sound, and saw that the sleeve's seam had split a little.",43713,2
43713,"I barely pulled at the sleeve, too.",43713,2
43713,I examined it a little more and I could see there wasn't much stitching on the seam.,43713,2
43713,Little reinforcement.,43713,2
43713,I am not surprised it split.,43713,2
43713,"I washed it on cold delicate cycle and hung to dry, thinking it was too fragile to really survive the dryer.",43713,2
43713,"Little did I realize, it was too fragile to survive the delicate cycle of the washer.",43713,2
43713,See the picture I have attached - there's a tiny hole on the back behind where the tag is sewn.,43713,2
43713,"I'll be able to fix this pretty easily, but still, a hole after the FIRST wash?",43713,2
43713,There was also a lot of bleeding of the red dye.,43713,2
43713,I hung this to dry to in my shower.,43713,2
43713,I didn't realize the wet blouse was touching the shower curtain during the drying process.,43713,2
43713,See the second picture.,43713,2
43713,Reddish stain on my curtain.,43713,2
43713,Crap.,43713,2
43713,"In sum, I love how cute this blouse is, but it's kind of a disaster in every other respect.",43713,2
43713,I can't really recommend it as anything other than a once-wear throwaway or a lounge-around-the-house deal.,43713,2
43714,Fast ship.,43714,2
43714,"If your waist is more 36""'s.",43714,2
43714,Look for something else.,43714,2
43714,I purchased an extra large.,43714,2
43714,"I am a 38"" waist.",43714,2
43714,Waaaaay to small.,43714,2
43715,It's not as nice as it looks.,43715,2
43715,I am usually a small and I bought a medium and it was still to small.,43715,2
43716,"the picture shows 3, the comments say that 3 are included in the price - yet I only received one gold one - I really wanted the white and the black.",43716,2
43716,the product description is not accurate to understand what you will receive.,43716,2
43717,"Product was too small when I tryed to return they suggested that I didn't return it because it would be too expensive to ship back to them and it wouldnt be worth it  so if you plan on buying this top please make sure that its the right size, size up on this top because I always wear an xl sometimes a L and this one was way too small",43717,2
43718,Beautiful color but sleeves are too short.,43718,2
43719,"my baby is 16 months old and these are 24 month size, but they are too small, he can't wear them.",43719,2
43719,Such a disappointment.,43719,2
43719,The fabric seems nice and warm though,43719,2
43720,"For something that promised to be ""scented"" sandalwood, it doesn't smell like anything, and the beads are in pretty rough shape.",43720,2
43720,It serves its purpose of being a string of beads for counting.,43720,2
43720,"Honestly, though, I expected better quality for the price; the drilling on the beads is rough/splintered, the elastic has dried glue smeared on it, the charm wire is unevenly bent, the beads are not sandalwood (or scented).",43720,2
43720,"For what I got, I should have paid half as much.",43720,2
43720,Really underwhelmed by this one.,43720,2
43721,"I always wear a small, wore a small all throughout my pregnancy, this was tiny, had to return",43721,2
43722,I was so excited to try this case out when I received it in the mail but unfortunately it was clear that it wasn't an iPhone 6s case like what I had ordered .,43722,2
43722,It was way too big.,43722,2
43722,The lighting was great though !,43722,2
43722,But that's about it .,43722,2
43722,Disappointed  and annoyed that happened .will be returning it .,43722,2
43723,too tight,43723,2
43724,This would have been a really cute lingerie outfit but the underwire around the cups kept slipping up past my boobs so I was unable to wear it because that made it uncomfortable and it obviously looked weird at that point.,43724,2
43725,"Received way too late, and it would not let me cancel my order.",43725,2
43725,"It fit, but looks too childish for a two year old boy.",43725,2
43725,Worked great on my infant.,43725,2
43726,Way smaller than I expected and thin cheap material,43726,2
43727,"Poorly made, bought for my 13 year old but fit my 9 year old better.",43727,2
43728,I was very excited to have a cute purse that would fit all of my work items including a full size planner that also can be worn as a cross body bag.,43728,2
43728,"Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks of use, the clips for the long strap broke as they are made out of low quality plastic.",43728,2
43728,I bought this as a lightening deal which is the only reason I gave two stars rather than one.,43728,2
43728,Still works as a hand bag and I can't really complain about the price I paid for it.,43728,2
43729,I liked this purse until the zipper continued to split open.,43729,2
43730,"I'm 5'4"" and 160 lbs 34D, so fairly curvy and I ordered the Large.",43730,2
43730,"It is WAY too big on the top, and when it gets wet it gets even looser (like the padding was sliding around loose) The bottoms fit like a glove, you'd have to be at least twice my cup size for the top to fit well (or have shoulders way higher than mine.",43730,2
43730,"I thought it'd be fine, cause it fit fairly well dry, not super tight, but i figured it wouldn't get too much stretchier when it got wet, but it totally did.",43730,2
43730,"It wasn't unusable, but definitely not as supportive as a sport suit should be (actually not supportive at all).",43730,2
43730,"Again the bottoms are fine, the color is just whats pictured, I would say the tops are mis-labeled a size or two too big.",43730,2
43731,I am 5'7 38D and XL was ordered.,43731,2
43731,The top sinched part came to the middle of my boobs and the hem of the dress was about 3 inches above my ankles...way too short for a maxi!,43731,2
43732,"I wear XL in t-shirts because I do not like them to fit snuggly; however, this one is snuggly designed.",43732,2
43732,"I do like the shirt itself, though.",43732,2
43732,It runs smaller than one would think.,43732,2
43733,"This is pretty, well made, and looks exactly like the picture, only much narrower.",43733,2
43733,"Unless you are a child or INCREDIBLY thin woman, don't expect this to look like the photo.",43733,2
43733,"I'm a size 10 and wound up buying two that I sewed together, side by side, so the bustle would be the correct width.",43733,2
43734,I'orden a M and fit like small,43734,2
43735,My son wears a 2/12 or a 3 and these were incredibly to small.,43735,2
43736,"Very very small, very thin fabric ,",43736,2
43737,The print is absolutely horrible.,43737,2
43737,I wear it when I go to the store or when I don't care how I look.,43737,2
43737,Would not buy it again!,43737,2
43738,I wanted to have an extra swimsuit bottom however this material is so thin and does not seem like swimsuit material.,43738,2
43738,I would not feel secure in wearing this at the pool.,43738,2
43738,It just seems too thin and too lightweight.,43738,2
43738,the fit was good however it read that it was Spandex so I thought it would give me some control--I did not feel any control or feel secure wearing this.,43738,2
43739,Fit way too small,43739,2
43740,Very very firm.,43740,2
43740,No movement in the foot,43740,2
43741,"Runs a little small, not exactly the quality was expecting",43741,2
43742,"I read the reviews before I ordered this and saw that it may be a little small; which I thought would be good for me, as I'm 5.3 120lbs and find that ""small"" pencil skirts/pencil skirt dresses are usually too big for me .",43742,2
43742,.,43742,2
43742,.,43742,2
43742,but this is just cheaply made/not a well-thought-out design.,43742,2
43742,Something you'd find in the Jr's section of Ross.,43742,2
43742,"I'd been looking for a brown, fitted, pencil skirt to add to my work wardrobe and thought this would be as cute as the photo's.",43742,2
43742,.,43742,2
43742,.,43742,2
43742,"well it was DEFINITELY fitted ;) kind of cute, but just too short for work and not the best material for a professional business look.",43742,2
43743,They foot strap is troublesome.,43743,2
43743,I don't like it.,43743,2
43743,It does keep the shirt tucked.,43743,2
43743,But if I can it it over I should have got the ones that snaps onto your socks,43743,2
43744,I don't like the material.,43744,2
43744,"It is thin, clings to the body and has become rough on the sides where your hand reaches and touches your skirt.",43744,2
43744,It looks old in 2-3 wears.,43744,2
43744,Cheap material.,43744,2
43745,"The strange thing is, the white pair fit perfectly and the black pair was a whole inch smaller.",43745,2
43745,Both pairs were size 9.,43745,2
43745,I have two other pairs of these flip flops and all were the same size except the black pair was a lot smaller and I can't wear them.,43745,2
43745,I do not know what happened.,43745,2
43746,The item was to small compare to other size,43746,2
43747,These took so long to arrive that I forgot I even ordered them.,43747,2
43747,"They're nice enough, but stretch out rather badly.",43747,2
43748,Too small!,43748,2
43749,There was no information about the size when I ordered these pants but I took a chance because I had a similar pair that I loved.,43749,2
43749,I'm a size 8 and the pants turned out to be a size 2 - pretty disappointing but i knew I was taking a chance.,43749,2
43750,Disappointed in size.,43750,2
43750,Quality was fine.,43750,2
43751,"Cute, but is not real good quality, you get what you pay for!",43751,2
43752,"Another odd shirt from china, it does not look like the pic, I wish Amazon would make sells put where the product was made and where it ships from.",43752,2
43752,This is the 3rd shirt I bought that the pic looks good but either it fits bad or the fabric is horrible.,43752,2
43753,"too small, cheaply made",43753,2
43754,Runs extremely small!!,43754,2
43754,!,43754,2
43755,"i wear an XL so I got an XL, I am 5'11"" 200lbs.",43755,2
43755,It was snug.,43755,2
43755,The sleeves were long enough but the jacket itself was too small.,43755,2
43755,I contacted the seller and they sent me an XXL.,43755,2
43755,Same problem.,43755,2
43755,"If you are petite, it will fit you perfect.",43755,2
43756,"Loved the look of these leggings, but they were too small.",43756,2
43756,They fit more like a 1X or XL.,43756,2
43756,Plus the die of the red rubbed off on my skin.,43756,2
43756,The seller was awesome and allowed me to return them no questions asked.,43756,2
43756,Might try buying some other leggings but at least a size or two bigger since I have been told I have a big butt.,43756,2
43757,Way too small I ordered an xxl and it fits like and xs,43757,2
43758,Temple - ear piece arrived broken off.,43758,2
43759,The chain is to short for the neck....,43759,2
43760,"This bag was listed under ""leather crossbody bag"" and it barely even has any leather on it.",43760,2
43761,Medium was way too big.,43761,2
43762,"Very pretty, but it was way too large.",43762,2
43762,I had to return it.,43762,2
43763,"It is massive, way to large I can't even wear it",43763,2
43764,Thankfully I ordered this to be my swimsuit cover up.,43764,2
43764,"I say it is somewhat small because the lining of this summer ""dress"" never even went to the hemline of the dress itself.",43764,2
43764,Maybe 3/4 of the way.,43764,2
43764,"And once I put it on, the lining rose up to about my waist.",43764,2
43764,Hahaha so the lining doesn't really cover my bottom at all.,43764,2
43764,"Plus there was a snag in the hemline of the lining itself, eventually going to cause it to unravel:((
I liked the actual length of the cover up.",43764,2
43764,"I am 5'4, so it was a perfect length, if only the quality of this was a bit better.",43764,2
43764,"However, it was only $15 and for a swimsuit coverup, I'm not really going to complain.",43764,2
43764,"Mama always said, ""you get what you pay for.""",43764,2
43765,This is see through and was way too big for me.,43765,2
43765,Top and Bottom.,43765,2
43765,Poorly made....ill stitching all throughout as if  a kid made it.,43765,2
43765,"Thank goodness I was refunded, otherwise I would have used this for dusting my furniture that's how thin it was.",43765,2
43766,Fits way to big,43766,2
43767,I love the style and look of the dress... but..... if you have a chest- you will have a very short looking blouse.,43767,2
43767,"I looked at the other reviews, measured, and made adjustments to make sure I have the right size.",43767,2
43767,If he fit of the dress was fine.,43767,2
43767,I just  wish the top pika dot blouse was longer.,43767,2
43767,"If you have a chest and want an empire waist it's for you- if not, pass on the dress.",43767,2
43768,love the concept it arrive before time but the gold color change to a rusted brown color.,43768,2
43769,poor quality,43769,2
43770,It's absolutely beautiful and I loved it.,43770,2
43770,But when I took it out of the bag it was broken.,43770,2
43770,This has happened many times with the jewelry I order off of amazon.,43770,2
43771,The sleeve length was too short for me.,43771,2
43771,"Also, the material was very itchy.",43771,2
43772,"The top is nice but the bottom is so large , it makes you look bigger.",43772,2
43773,Ugly dress,43773,2
43774,"Looks to be well made, but it is short and very tight.",43774,2
43775,"It was incredibly difficult to install, I ended up taking it to a jeweler and he was able to make it work.",43775,2
43775,"I was afraid I was going to break the bar that you have to pry open to adjust it, so I tried to limit my adjusting.",43775,2
43775,The final straw was today when it just fell off my wrist into several pieces.,43775,2
43775,It's lucky that my watch face didn't crack when it hit the floor.,43775,2
43775,"This band looks nice, but is not worth it if it's going to fall to pieces.",43775,2
43776,"Not what I thought it would be, but ya get what ya pay for!",43776,2
43776,It's even more cheaper looking in person...,43776,2
43777,"it's really small
but it's cute
it's not really a sweater",43777,2
43778,Socks are shorter than the picture shows!,43778,2
43779,"It is okay, doesn't really look like the picture; was desperate and out of time so keeping this dress.",43779,2
43780,Wore the shoes 3x ....now one of the shoes don't light up...,43780,2
43781,Really short !,43781,2
43782,Not true to size and material does not breath.,43782,2
43783,"I had a feeling it would be small for the size, so I ordered a XXL instead of an XL.",43783,2
43783,It still fit like a large.,43783,2
43783,Super tight.,43783,2
43783,The material seems pretty flimsy.,43783,2
43783,"I do like the shirt, I just think that it is way over priced for the quality.",43783,2
43784,Coat looks lovely in picture but is clearly not sized for Americans.,43784,2
43784,Turned out as an empire waisted coat for my daughter which is sad as it's a pretty coat.,43784,2
43784,Now I know not to order clothes made in Asia due to sizing issues.,43784,2
43784,Pity....,43784,2
43785,"Shirt runs small so make sure order up, but love the saying.",43785,2
43786,Cute but order at least one size up.,43786,2
43787,Dress was too short.,43787,2
43787,Not floor length and looks more like a nightgown than a formal dress,43787,2
43788,"The feel is very light, and very synthetic.",43788,2
43788,"The pants were much too narrow for me, with no stretch in the leg.",43788,2
43788,I would probably need to go up two sizes.,43788,2
43788,Returned.,43788,2
43789,"Very sheer, sharp nails could rip them.",43789,2
43789,The bow is very loose,43789,2
43790,Very poor quality.,43790,2
43791,Delivered a few days late and the tracking number they gave me didn't work.,43791,2
43791,"The shirt fits as expected , but the red is hardly a red.",43791,2
43791,Very light in color and reminds me more of orange.,43791,2
43791,Definitely did not look like the picture in terms of color.,43791,2
43791,Sort of a waste of money for it to not be a RED SHIRT.,43791,2
43792,It was covered in a white powder I had to clean off.,43792,2
43792,The metal on the pendant and chain are painted silver and very generic looking.,43792,2
43792,The paint was already chipped and coming off in places when I recieved it.,43792,2
43792,Shipping took over 4 weeks.,43792,2
43792,"You get what you pay for i guess, cheaply made, and it shows.",43792,2
43793,"To many sharp edges, doesn't open very easily and only has 6 slots.",43793,2
43794,"I read the reviews so I ordered one size up, so instead of an XL, I purchased an XXL which was still very small.",43794,2
43794,"The bottom portion fit a little ok ( my butt is big so it stretched the waist out, but the belt helps cinch it slightly).",43794,2
43794,"I'm an African-American woman , 5'4 and weigh 190.",43794,2
43794,The buttons were a little stretched at the top.,43794,2
43794,I had on spanx and a waist clincher so I thought it would fit better.,43794,2
43794,"I normally wear a size 14,  bra size 38D, so if you're a shapely big girl with hips, thighs, and boobs, I would suggest to go two sizes up.",43794,2
43794,I couldn't wear it to the event because I received this product the same day.,43794,2
43794,"If I didn't care about my appearance, I would have worn it, but I can't go out looking like a Ball Park frank about to pop!!",43794,2
43794,I only kept to because it's cute and will encourage me to lose a few pounds so it will fit nicely.,43794,2
43795,Does not look ANYTHING like the picture.,43795,2
43795,I fell in love with this based on the funnel neck look.,43795,2
43795,No.,43795,2
43795,just a bulky hoodie :/,43795,2
43796,runs big,43796,2
43797,"Very nice sweater, but the extra large is too small, I want to return it for a larger size , but.",43797,2
43797,Extra largest size you have.,43797,2
43797,Pleas let me know how I can return it?,43797,2
43798,"Bought what should have been the right size but it was way too small, not even close to fitting.",43798,2
43798,The material and appearance is nice I guess but doesnt matter if all I can do is admire it there in the underwear drawer.,43798,2
43799,Bought the khaki color and it showed up closer to a traditional cream color...,43799,2
43799,I think the image for that option needs to be updated because its not even close to the in-person color.,43799,2
43800,Worst mail package ever.. Christmas present and it looks like crap!,43800,2
43800,!,43800,2
43801,"Right size, though the material is not what I expected.",43801,2
43801,Too thin.,43801,2
43801,It looked like cotton in the picture but it wasn't.,43801,2
43801,I hate ordering from overseas.,43801,2
43801,Never again.,43801,2
43802,too small,43802,2
43803,Back of the dress is beautiful the front is not as pictured.,43803,2
43803,Straps are wider than pictured and cut is way too high.,43803,2
43804,Fits fine.,43804,2
43804,Washes well.,43804,2
43804,But the seam that connects the under layer to the top shows through.,43804,2
43804,I'm picky and it doesn't look right.,43804,2
43805,it was too small in some places and too big in others  the material is awful  I'm constantly inching,43805,2
43806,Not as expected,43806,2
43807,"Style was okay, but overall quality wasn't exactly as expected.",43807,2
43807,"Plus the shirt is short, barely makes it over the belly button.",43807,2
43808,"The leg warmers are cute and soft, but they unfortunately they don't stay up.",43808,2
43808,Within minutes they were slouched down to just above my 5 month old's knees.,43808,2
43809,Too small,43809,2
43810,Beautiful on the model.,43810,2
43810,"Bottom part is VERY SHEER(yes you can see through it) Top part is beautiful, but made too small",43810,2
43811,It broke before I could wear it.,43811,2
43811,it was to late to send back.,43811,2
43812,cheaply made.,43812,2
43813,If you are not sure what size to order - just order your regular size.,43813,2
43813,I sized up so it would be really comfortable - but it was huge!,43813,2
43813,"Also, after trying it on the quality was not what I have expected.",43813,2
43814,I ordered a petite dress and the length of the dress was 5 inches too long.,43814,2
43814,Also the zipper was rough going up and down needing someone else to help with it.,43814,2
43814,I do not believe this was made according to the measurements I gave them.,43814,2
43814,Lace is not as pretty as it is in the picture.,43814,2
43814,Very disappointed.,43814,2
43815,Item was a large the size I wear and it didn't fit.,43815,2
43816,I expected to bracelet to stretch.,43816,2
43817,this runs small.,43817,2
43817,I ordered 3 things all the same size and this one to small,43817,2
43818,"Purchased both silver and gold chain harnesses... looks pretty, but BREAKS EASILY!",43818,2
43818,Not for woman who are busty or larger than a size 5.,43818,2
43819,Didn't fit.,43819,2
43819,Didn't return in time.,43819,2
43820,broke,43820,2
43821,Very bad quality and huge fit for a small (I have a size 1 in jeans),43821,2
43822,"Preface:
 5'5"", 120 lbs
 I wear a US size 3 pants size, mainly because
 I am 0% a** (I mean it's not inverted or anything... but serious ""white girl"" booty over here, I'm telling you.",43822,2
43822,"With the lack of sizing information on the page, I think I assumed these would... fit into the ""one size fits all"" domain.",43822,2
43822,"Well, they didn't.",43822,2
43822,They were MUCH too small for me.,43822,2
43822,"Plus, there's little-to-no give to the material at all.",43822,2
43822,"And so, we all know where this goes, yeah?",43822,2
43822,"They cut into the flesh, leaving awkward bulges and deep marks once I got them off.",43822,2
43822,"And please, let's not get started on the panty-lines those awkward bulges made underneath a thick pair of denim shorts.",43822,2
43822,They're also - for lack of a better way to describe it - made... shallowly?,43822,2
43822,"Like the front and back are both super low-rise, hitting just above the pubic bone in the front and barely above the pertinent back area.",43822,2
43822,It was a travesty because the design is so gosh darn cute.,43822,2
43822,"I imagine they'd probably fit a size 0-1 that's a couple inches shorter than me, though...",43822,2
43822,"I'll recommend them to those of you out there fitting that description, if you're out there and considering purchase.",43822,2
43822,"Because not only are they cute, the bow's unobtrusive and material pretty comfortable.",43822,2
43822,"Once last note: the description is currently (09/09/2016) referencing this item as ""Sexy, Playful and Comfortable Open Crotch"" - they're not open crotch.",43822,2
43822,"Which I was personally glad about, because I got them for a photo shoot based on the product images (which implied a solid panel on some of the other color options).",43822,2
43823,This is an alright dress.,43823,2
43823,Definitely a little different than the picture and it fits a lot smaller than I was expecting.,43823,2
43823,Seems like it was made a little cheaply.,43823,2
43824,It really looks cheap.,43824,2
43825,This skirt is see though and shiny.,43825,2
43825,Looks like a dress up outfit,43825,2
43826,Looked discoloured when it arrived.,43826,2
43827,Not real impressed with this bag.,43827,2
43827,I love turtles and was looking for a turtle bag but I wanted something I could actually carry stuff in.,43827,2
43827,The bag was not lined and the fabric so thin you can see through it in places.,43827,2
43827,"I gave it 2 stars because I do think the print is cute, but if I had seen this in the store in person I would not have paid even 3$ for it and without the turtle print it's worth about a dollar.",43827,2
43828,Looked great and was comfortable but broke within a week.,43828,2
43829,Had cut outs.,43829,2
43829,Didn't like them.,43829,2
43830,The short is a JOKE for sizing.,43830,2
43830,"I wear a large, but ordered an extra-large just to be on the safe side.",43830,2
43830,The shirt was the size of a small-medium.,43830,2
43830,There is no way it would fit!,43830,2
43830,Really disappointed.,43830,2
43831,The sizes I picked up size 8/10 18/20 def weren't even close to those sizes they stuck like glue to my kids wasn't happy with this purchase at all,43831,2
43832,Too small and did not met advertisement.,43832,2
43833,Cheap material,43833,2
43834,It was too small for my LG G5 in it's case.,43834,2
43834,I was lead to believe it was bigger than it was.,43834,2
43834,Gave it to my daughter who had a smaller phone.,43834,2
43835,it's very pretty but doesn't fit my ear :(,43835,2
43836,I actually think this piece is cute; but I was quite disappointed that the ring had snapped off before it arrived.,43836,2
43836,We had to take it and have it repaired...,43836,2
43837,bad.,43837,2
43838,Second week of classes and the seams along the back came open then two days later the thread holding the strap on broke.,43838,2
43838,Looked good but low quality.,43838,2
43839,My daughter has always had a pair of crocs; they are so easy to put on and wear.,43839,2
43839,She loves them.,43839,2
43839,The problem we've had with this lined pair is debris getting stuck in the lining.,43839,2
43839,The play ground at her school has mulch under the equipment.,43839,2
43839,"The mulch gets in the shoes and is impossible to get out, even after a run through the washing machine.",43839,2
43839,(This happened the first time she wore them to school and hasn't been able to wear since).,43839,2
43839,She can't wear the shoes without getting a splinter.,43839,2
43840,"Too small, same size on all three items, only 1 fit.",43840,2
43840,Never ordering again.,43840,2
43841,Not the size they said it was - fo sho!,43841,2
43842,2 pairs of pants same size one fits good the other to small,43842,2
43843,So bummed!,43843,2
43843,"This coat looked great in the picture, but when it arrived, and I tried it on, it wasn't flattering to my frame AT ALL.",43843,2
43843,The shoulders seemed to be disproportionately larger than the waist...almost reminiscent of 1980's football shoulders.,43843,2
43843,"Not sure if it was just my straight-all-the-way-down frame (my shoulders are slightly larger than my waist, so any clothing that's even the slightest bit bulky at the shoulders makes me look awful!)",43843,2
43843,"Also, the quality seemed a bit cheap.",43843,2
43843,"Some of the stitching was coming undone, and it seemed like the lining had been cut too big, and then sewn in anyway.",43843,2
43843,I sent this one back weeks ago and have yet to receive my refund.,43843,2
43844,Much too small,43844,2
43845,not flattering,43845,2
43846,"I like the shirt, but it is way too small.",43846,2
43846,"I usually wear an extra small or small, but ordered a medium based on reviews.",43846,2
43846,The medium fits more like an XXS.,43846,2
43847,"Sent back or thrifty shoppered it, can't remember",43847,2
43848,"I love the idea of this suite, but it's too thin, so I gave it to my friend for her and her husband's on their boat.",43848,2
43848,"I have a Kim K's  bottom, which is unheard of in the Asian community.",43848,2
43849,Chain piece was broken off.,43849,2
43849,"Not fixable, but not worth returning.",43849,2
43850,The logo on the shirt we got sticks to itself.,43850,2
43850,It has to be pulled apart and doesn't lie flat.,43850,2
43850,Disappointing performance for an expensive tee shirt.,43850,2
43851,"Works well for straight post earrings, but very difficult to use with hook styles.",43851,2
43852,Terrible material.,43852,2
43852,Don't purchase.,43852,2
43852,Scratchy,43852,2
43853,This hat is a cheap knock-off.,43853,2
43853,Looks something to wear to a costume party.,43853,2
43853,Will give to my grandson for Halloween.,43853,2
43854,Cute dress but it runs small.,43854,2
43854,I ordered one size up but the dress was still to small.,43854,2
43855,"did not fit well,poorly made",43855,2
43856,Color not as expected and more like polyester than chiffon.,43856,2
43857,"The shirt is sized much wider then usual and the cotton material is very stiff even after a washing, not soft whatsoever.",43857,2
43857,I ordered a 3x and it was much more like a 4x wide buy a 2x length (after initial washing)...awkward sizing.,43857,2
43857,This shirt is not at all the proportionate appearing shirt as in the photo!,43857,2
43858,It's good quality just ordered the wrong size,43858,2
43859,Very tight fitting,43859,2
43860,Too short and the bottom is loose not good quality nor design- not forming,43860,2
43861,Not what I wanted.,43861,2
43861,Too short,43861,2
43862,Would have been ok for a one day event but the size must run small.,43862,2
43862,It was for my mother which wears a size 10 to 12 normally.,43862,2
43862,Size 14 wouldn't even start to zip.,43862,2
43862,Returns are through USPS and you are responsible to pay for shipping back.,43862,2
43862,Not worth ordering in a different size if it doesn't fit.,43862,2
43862,Cost more than the dress for shipping to return it.,43862,2
43863,It's nice.,43863,2
43863,A little smaller than expected.,43863,2
43864,Love the print.,43864,2
43864,"I have no idea what size woman these will fit, it definitely can't be one who has more in the butt area because mine is only a handful and they don't pull up all the way over mine.",43864,2
43864,Plumber's Crack for real...lol.,43864,2
43865,The balaclava bunches up and bundles up while worn.,43865,2
43865,It does not hold in place.,43865,2
43865,Also continuously inhaling fleece is a worry for those with bronchitis or allergies.,43865,2
43865,Suggest a form fitting ski mask of spandex.,43865,2
43865,Definately warm but just doesn;t stay in place.,43865,2
43866,"These shoes are cute, but the toe box area is very uncomfortable.",43866,2
43866,The padding in the shoe also stops at the end of the arch and there is minimal padding under the ball of the foot (where all of the weight it).,43866,2
43867,Cheaply made.,43867,2
43867,"When the clip arrived, the decoration was separated from the hair pin; the decoration had been glued to the pin.",43867,2
43868,Would be perfect for somone with a long torso and either  small bust or large fake ones.,43868,2
43868,Fabric left over at top after I put it on and there is not enough cup coverage at the top.,43868,2
43868,Had to return it.,43868,2
43869,Cheap material!!!,43869,2
43869,Feels like craft felt!!,43869,2
43869,!,43869,2
43870,very tiny & don't see it glowing in the dark,43870,2
43871,Way too small and the color was more black than blue--a very odd color.,43871,2
43871,I returned these to my local store to avoid paying return shipping.,43871,2
43871,"Crazy to me that Avenue charges $8.50 to ship a pair of pants, but that doesn't cover if a return is needed.",43871,2
43871,"Hellooooo....this is clothing, and the reason why dressing rooms are in clothing stores....The store clerk said these jeans should be ordered in one size larger than what you wear in the butter jeans.",43871,2
43871,That would've been nice to know before my online purchase!,43871,2
43871,"Ordered their dark blue butter jeans at the store as they are never available online and happened to run into a great sale, but in general, the online prices are typically much better!",43871,2
43872,"The waist was fine, but the legs were very narrow.",43872,2
43872,I'll be returning these.,43872,2
43873,The color is not true to the picture poorly man lights work wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.,43873,2
43873,Stay clear of this product size is smaller then expected,43873,2
43874,Too small and very short,43874,2
43875,I don't like this shirt that much.,43875,2
43875,"Is cute if you are thin enough like the girls in the picture, but if you are a little chubby, just like me, the shirt may look to tight.",43875,2
43875,"I would definitely recommend to buy it if you are thin, small girl, it would look great.",43875,2
43875,"But remember that you pay what you get for, so the quality of the shirt is not good.",43875,2
43876,made of cheap metal turn fingers black but it was cheap so buyer be warned,43876,2
43877,Not good quality :( for the price,43877,2
43878,"Ordered this dress for an event, it arrived damaged (the side seam was opened) so I was unable to wear it.",43878,2
43878,It's a very cute dress but I could see multiple spots where the seams looked loose so it doesn't appear to be well made.,43878,2
43879,The top of the dress is a little bulky.,43879,2
43880,Does not work as well as some I have had.,43880,2
43881,"Way to small, covered WAY less than the photo.",43881,2
43882,The material felt very cheaply made.,43882,2
43882,It felt as if I was going to tear it just trying to put it on.,43882,2
43882,I usually wear a small and I ordered a medium and it was still too small for me.,43882,2
43883,Super cutel but much to big for my small waist.,43883,2
43883,Guess I missed I couldn't pick my size.,43883,2
43883,I'm pretty disappointed.,43883,2
43884,It's very uneven.,43884,2
43884,It's very loose in certain areas.,43884,2
43884,The cut is off.,43884,2
43884,Would not purchase again.,43884,2
43885,Had to return.,43885,2
43885,I ordered this shirt in the size that was recommended and it's way smaller than expected.,43885,2
43885,I would have to buy it in probably 2 sizes bigger than I already did.,43885,2
43885,"Doesn't look like what's pictured, not very long so it doesn't give the blousy look at all",43885,2
43886,"The skirt part was much more straight than it looks, Not flared like it shows.",43886,2
43887,Poor quality,43887,2
43888,Supposed custom fit just not good.,43888,2
43888,Shoulder straps fall.,43888,2
43888,To little breast cups and can't get to them to take out.,43888,2
43888,Jacket selves not neatly put in.,43888,2
43888,Good dress concept poorly put together  jacket does not match dress well  not what expected  Will not buy custom dress again.,43888,2
43889,These glasses seemed to make everything brighter instead of dimming the glare when driving.,43889,2
43889,I returned them.,43889,2
43890,too big wish.an extra small was possible.,43890,2
43890,lol,43890,2
43891,"Extremely heavy
The color of the gold is not like in the picture
The fit is at least 1 size too small do order up",43891,2
43892,It does not look like the picture .,43892,2
43892,I will be returning it asap.,43892,2
43893,poor quality..,43893,2

43894,The charm fell off first day I wore it.,43894,2
43895,Will be returning shoes,43895,2
43896,Slips off your head,43896,2
43897,These are much smaller than I expected.,43897,2
43897,"They are very, very thin, so there is no compression to speak of.",43897,2
43897,I bought them to wear under shorter gym shorts but they are so short themselves they don't work for that.,43897,2
43897,I gave them to my teenage daughter to wear under her soccer shorts.,43897,2
43898,Didn't  return it Have it to my Petite Size Daughter.,43898,2
43899,I LOVE this brand of pjs for my toddler and i was excited to see they make adult pjs.,43899,2
43899,"I'm 5'2"", size 4 and I ordered a medium based on other reviews stating these run small and will shrink.",43899,2
43899,"Even after washing and drying, these PJ'S are still too big.",43899,2
43899,They shrunk a lot in the wash but they shrunk in LENGTH.,43899,2
43899,I now have pj's that are big in the waist and just barely hit my ankle.,43899,2
43899,If anyone of normal height ordered these they would definitely end up looking like capri pants.,43899,2
43899,Same issue with the top.,43899,2
43899,"The circumference didn't shrink, just the arm length and shirt length.",43899,2
43899,Guess these will be comfy for maternity PJ'S but that about it.,43899,2
43900,the pendent was beautiful but the chain was fragile and snapped the second day,43900,2
43901,Was what I ordered just to big for me,43901,2
43902,These are great socks for a child but unfortunately weren't marketed as such.,43902,2
43902,I wear a 6.5 womens and they were small for me.,43902,2
43903,I ordered this backpack for my 4 year old daughter.,43903,2
43903,"When i received it I was pleased with the size because it wasn't too big nor too small, however on the second day of use one of the straps ripped off of the backpack.",43903,2
43903,"I wouldn't be upset if it was caused by being rough with it, but it wasn't.",43903,2
43903,My daughter was carrying a coloring book and a 24 pack of crayons in the backpack and it was just simply to flimsy to support that weight.,43903,2
43903,Wouldn't recommend to anyone.,43903,2
43904,this item ran to small and it was hard to get over my shoulders and so tight on my but and thighs it was like underwear.,43904,2
43904,Definitely could not wear this.,43904,2
43904,I even ordered the size i wear in everything.,43904,2
43904,Make sure you order like 3 sizes up!!!!!,43904,2
43904,"Also, the quality of the material is very cheap.",43904,2
43904,I don't recommend this product.,43904,2
43905,"These ear muffs  d  o  keep ears insulated from the cold, however the inner surface should have been much more padded because ears hurt from the pressure, and the reindeer motif pegs them as a Christmas season item.",43905,2
43906,This is a rip off.,43906,2
43906,It's  not a 'board' at all.,43906,2
43906,It is more like a thing piece of plastic paper that's printed in.,43906,2
43906,You would not be able to write on it without a clipboard or something else hard behind it.,43906,2
43906,The only reason that I'm rating it is 2 stars vs. 1 star is because it seems to wipe off nicely.,43906,2
43906,Way over priced and misrepresented.,43906,2
43907,Shirt was way too small...I purchased a child XL and it seemed more like a child Medium,43907,2
43908,One of the black inserts on the cuff links fell out the first time worn.,43908,2
43908,"Very fair price, less than satisfactory performance.",43908,2
43909,Stiching failed in about a month and had to sew it up to fix it.,43909,2
43910,The shirt's stitching was loose and coming apart,43910,2
43911,"pendent is very beautiful, however the chain that came with broke w/in 20mins of wearing it.",43911,2
43912,After 5 minutes of looking at it...,43912,2
43912,I found a tear in the middle... don't look like I can sew it and too expensive to return it!!!,43912,2
43912,Was really looking forward to wearing it!!,43912,2
43912,!,43912,2
43913,"I normally wear a medium top, but I ordered a large in this in hopes that it would fit like the picture.",43913,2
43913,"In order to get it to look like the picture, I should have ordered two sizes bigger.",43913,2
43913,The sleeves were a little short.,43913,2
43913,The material was itchy.,43913,2
43913,It was more of a hassle to return it online then it was for me to sell locally.,43913,2
43914,"No button, it's stitched together with the button as a cosmetic add.",43914,2
43915,Too samall,43915,2
43916,"This dress looked really cute in the pictures, but it was so huge on me.",43916,2
43916,"Pros:
- Good quality for price
- Comfortable material  I like the chiffon
- Cute style and design
Cons:
- Very large on me and I ordered a small ( I am 56 and 112 pounds )
- Too long in the back and one side is longer than the other

Overall, the design of this dress is cute and the material is very comfortable, however it was so large on me it looked funny ( see pictures ).",43916,2
43916,I think with a belt ( see pictures of when I held the dress back a little ) this dress could be really cute.,43916,2
43916,For me I just needed something smaller and more fitted.,43916,2
43916,I am taking away three stars because of the size of the dress.,43916,2
43916,It is so big that I cannot wear it.,43916,2
43916,Two stars added for comfort and design.,43916,2
43916,"If you have any questions regarding this product, please leave me a comment below and I will do my best to answer.",43916,2
43916,Thanks!,43916,2
43917,Was not a fan of these.,43917,2
43917,Gloves kept falling off the clip so we had to return them.,43917,2
43918,"very cute waist belt but unfortunately upon receiving the belt, ribbon was split on one side... i have to look for similar colored ribbon to replace it..",43918,2
43919,Humongous.,43919,2
43919,"The small fit like a large, and it is so see-through that you could read a book through it.",43919,2
43919,Also there is no shape to it.,43919,2
43920,WAY too small!,43920,2
43920,"If you are medium, get a large - XL.",43920,2
43920,"They also ride over the pubic area very low, so I hope you have a good waxer.",43920,2
43921,Ordered a couple of sizes bigger but the bra part still won't fit,43921,2
43922,The soles separated a month after receiving them.,43922,2
43923,"Pretty, just small",43923,2
43924,"Beautiful in color, it's going to be nice, but very disapponted in overall quality.",43924,2
43924,"One side had no finger loop, the other came off when I was inspecting the item.",43924,2
43924,"I'll make my own to make it work, because it's still pretty and will work for a quick costume, but not overwhelming pleased.",43924,2
43925,I was hopeful for this dress.,43925,2
43925,"While I liked the material, the fit was horrible.",43925,2
43925,"I ordered up a size in the hopes that the neck opening would be large enough, but the neckline is nowhere near large enough to hang off a shoulder.",43925,2
43926,This took forever to get to me.,43926,2
43926,it said one size fits all...and if I wore a small it would probably fit the way I expected.,43926,2
43926,"I'm 5'7""...it's really short in the front.",43926,2
43926,The back covers my bum.,43926,2
43926,"The fur is really, really fake.",43926,2
43926,I ended up removing the fur and like it better without the fake look.,43926,2
43926,I'll keep it just because it's a bigger hassle to return than just keep for the price.,43926,2
43927,SUPER SEXY Summer dress!,43927,2
43927,I have FOUR just didn't  care for the color of this one it was more of a mint green than the picture.,43927,2
43927,I was hoping for turquoise.,43927,2
43927,I returned it for RED>,43927,2
43928,"Great cost, however are what you pay for: cheap, stiff material.",43928,2

43929,Very thin!,43929,2
43929,"Not long or empire waisted for anyone over 5'4"" tall.",43929,2
43929,"No hem, just a surged seam.",43929,2
43929,The appropriate quality for the price I suppose.,43929,2
43929,Disappointed but can maybe still maybe make it work by adding more tule for a fuller skirt.,43929,2
43930,"I am very disappointed,  I am 5'4 and the length of the Jumpsuit stops at my calf and not at my ankle as shown in the picture!",43930,2
43930,!,43930,2
43930,!,43930,2
43930,Plus it is difficult to communicate with the seller.,43930,2

43932,Very disappointed in the quality of these bracelets.,43932,2
43933,This dress has no underwire or anything to help shape the curves.,43933,2
43933,It's not nearly as glamorous as the picture makes it out to be.,43933,2
43933,Horrible purchase.,43933,2
43934,"Nice material, just extremely larger than expected according to size chart!",43934,2
43935,"way too small, will have to diet to wear it",43935,2
43936,Quality of fabric was poor,43936,2
43937,I liked how the bottoms fit but the top is unrealistic to use as a swim suit very very thin doesn't cover breast and easily comes off... nice for a photo shoot but wouldn't trust swimming in it,43937,2
43938,Sweet but small,43938,2
43939,"runs way to big fits like a regular undershirt, no compression i am 6'2 and bought a small and the shirt is too long.",43939,2

43940,But gave it away because it did not light up.,43940,2
43941,Too small and short in length,43941,2
43942,To small for the average size woman.,43942,2
43943,I'm a little peeved because parts of the costume stuck together and took the color off when I pulled it apart.,43943,2
43943,The tissue paper also stuck on the tiara star and won't come off,43943,2
43944,"Nice Graphics, but snug fit and matrial very light weight compared to most t-shirts.",43944,2
43945,the color is not the same as the picture.,43945,2
43946,Too small!,43946,2
43946,Ordered 10-12 size.,43946,2
43946,No way possible your little mermaid can swim in it that tight!,43946,2
43947,I'm giving this two stars for the following reason; the suit is super cute and I loved the style and color (I bought the black and lime green; true color to picture).,43947,2
43947,"However I bought two sizes up because I am very busty, I wear a DD; so I actually bought a XXL.",43947,2
43947,The bottoms a little big but I can manage but the top is way too small.,43947,2
43947,Looks like it could be a C-cup.,43947,2
43947,"Needless to say I am spilling out of the cups, the top is adjustable which is a great feature and great material.",43947,2
43947,If I could return just the top for a large size I would give this product 5-stars.,43947,2
43948,Big enough for an XL but find that upper arms and back are pretty tight for this size.,43948,2
43949,Too small,43949,2
43950,Looked great but I slept over night and shower and the necklace has gone from gold to mental.,43950,2
43950,It looks nice but not worth it,43950,2
43951,I don't like this shirt much.,43951,2
43951,"It looks cute in the neck/shoulder area, but I expected it to be longer than it is.",43951,2
43951,"I'm 5'8-1/2"" and ordered a Large, and this hits right at the top of my hipbones.",43951,2
43951,It's also REALLY big around...almost tent-like.,43951,2
43951,It would look much better if the body of the shirt was 5 inches smaller around (and I'm not skinny - I have a thick waist and wear a size 10 in jeans).,43951,2
43951,This shirt kind of makes me look pregnant.,43951,2
43952,One size fits all really didn't fit me.,43952,2
43953,a little big but still nice,43953,2
43954,"My daughter loves the top, but the shorts are not actually denim and they are a bit large for her.",43954,2
43955,Cheap feeling tank top.,43955,2
43955,Not flattering or supportive.,43955,2
43955,Not something for someone with large breasts.,43955,2
43956,Has a strange smell even after washing.,43956,2
43957,Beautiful skirt unfortunately did not fit me.,43957,2
43957,"I'm 5'4"" and 130 lbs and the one size is too small.",43957,2
43957,Quality of stitching is not great either.,43957,2
43957,For the price it is a very pretty skirt.,43957,2
43957,Bright and almost silk like material.,43957,2
43957,Had it fit I probably would have looked past the stiching and kept it but since it didn't I will be returning it.,43957,2
43958,"It's pretty the material is okay for the price
But it does run small
Order 2 sizes up",43958,2
43959,Too small.,43959,2
43959,I returned it.,43959,2
43960,The winder looks good.,43960,2
43960,Seemed well built.,43960,2
43960,My Bulova with a longer chain fit fine.,43960,2
43960,Then I plugged it in and tried to use it.,43960,2
43960,The winder had a loud click noise in operation.,43960,2
43960,Took it apart to see if something was lose.,43960,2
43960,The nose was coming from inside the motor.,43960,2
43960,The winder was on the dresser ob the other side of the room and it was too loud to even sleep.,43960,2
43960,Returned as defective.,43960,2
43960,Was going to rebuy but is now $30 more then I paid from the same vendor.,43960,2
43960,Guess I well try a different one from a different vendor.,43960,2
43961,THE MATERIAL IS VERY THIN.,43961,2
43961,YOU WILL NOTICE A DIFFERENCE AFTER A FEW WASHES.,43961,2
43962,Not high quality at all.,43962,2
43962,It is made out of a really weird material.,43962,2
43963,too many dups,43963,2
43964,Cheaply made.,43964,2
43964,Not a fla,43964,2
43965,Not a good fit for woman who L or XL,43965,2
43966,Bulker than picture and has very fake gold coloring,43966,2
43967,Beware the image above is not what you receive!,43967,2
43967,"I was expecting a California pendant with the heart over Los Angeles, like in the photo.",43967,2
43967,Instead I received a pendant with the heart in the top middle of the state.,43967,2
43967,"Also, the chain and pendant are completely tarnished.",43967,2
43967,I can't give this as a gift looking like this!,43967,2
43968,it doesnt fall correctly.,43968,2
43968,it fits fine in the waist but falls poor;y and looks cheap.,43968,2
43969,It is TINY.,43969,2
43969,I look like a flying squirrel in it.,43969,2
43969,"I do have to say, the material is nice and thick,  Buy at lease 2 sizes bigger.",43969,2
43970,There is a seam on the top of the arms which has to be adjusted often and the medium I bought ran small.,43970,2
43970,I got the impression that someone had a pattern and recreated it.,43970,2
43970,Looks better in the pics here than it does on.,43970,2
43970,Buttons are smaller and a bit further off center.,43970,2
43970,Shoulders sit oddly.,43970,2
43971,like the product except the tags itch,43971,2
43972,Disappointed.,43972,2
43972,Not as wide as I thought it would be.,43972,2
43972,Can't fold into a triangle before tying.,43972,2
43972,Wanted to wear as a headwrap.,43972,2
43972,"However, it's very pretty.",43972,2
43973,"This shirt does run small as others have said,so I ordered a larger size to ensure that it would fit.",43973,2
43973,It does.,43973,2
43973,The problem with this shirt is that it arrived severely creased and also stained on the arm and chest.,43973,2
43973,"This was a brand new shirt, and was still in the manufacturers overwrap, so I know that the stains were not the sellers fault.",43973,2
43973,But the stains make what would have been a lovely shirt completely unwearable.,43973,2
43973,"I noticed this too late, after throwing away packaging and labels,so I can't return it.",43973,2
43974,Fabric is not suitable for casual wear and has a rough cross weave/spandexy look.,43974,2
43974,The top half is the gray legging compared to a normal VIV legging texture.,43974,2
43975,This product wasn't what it's picture looks like.,43975,2
43975,Not worth buying.,43975,2
43975,Would not recommend to anyone.,43975,2
43976,Is too  small  for the size  xxx,43976,2
43977,I bought this pants for my son that is very slim.,43977,2
43977,He normally wears the super skinny jeans.,43977,2
43977,My son tried them on and the pants were somewhat baggy on him.,43977,2
43977,They fit like the regular skinny jeans and not the super skinny.,43977,2
43978,to tight,43978,2
43979,"Returned, the fabric is mostly polyester and looks like it.",43979,2
43979,"Other than that, the fit was okay but looked cheap.",43979,2
43980,I must have missed something somewhere.,43980,2
43980,"I thought I was getting three bracelets: gold, silver, and rose gold.",43980,2
43980,I only received the silver and the gold.,43980,2
43980,The quality is mediocre.,43980,2
43980,The size is okay.,43980,2
43980,I wouldn't recommend this for anyone.,43980,2
43981,"I've used this type of product in the past, but I found these to be a lesser adhesive and they don't last as I expected.",43981,2
43981,Other brands hold tighter to the ear lobe.,43981,2
43981,I won't purchase these again.,43981,2
43982,It looks cute but it's a different material than what it looks like and it feels kind of cheap.,43982,2
43982,I will not purchase again even though I did want another one from the same company with a different design that looks pretty.,43982,2
43982,"And it's a cloth material so if it gets dirty you can't really wipe it off, I don't know what you would do.",43982,2
43983,i absolutely love it but reading the reviews I bought bigger and it still was cut small a 3x is a size medium!,43983,2
43984,"I'm not a big person, I got a Med,  way to small.",43984,2
43984,More of a kid size.,43984,2
43985,This is a great suit...except for the top.,43985,2
43985,The fit was a bit bigger than I expected so I ordered a size down (getting this one) but the bust is just not designed well (for me at least).,43985,2
43985,Perhaps it was bent during shipment and storage but the pads are somewhat bent making the top look like its slanted and not on correctly.,43985,2
43985,There is no way to remove the pads which may have helped.,43985,2
43985,I'm really sad I had to return this because I thought it was really cool but there is just no way the construction of this bathing suit will work for me (and I'm sure others).,43985,2
43986,the size runs too small so I had to give it away,43986,2
43987,"the product is not what i expected, i don't like the color and i will returned it back and choose and another color , i want to know the process for returns
regards",43987,2
43988,"The suit itself is nice but like everyone else said, runs VERY small.",43988,2
43988,I am 5'3'' 140 ordered a large and I look like the Michelin man.,43988,2
43988,The straps are wayyy too tight.,43988,2
43988,I don't even think an XL would have been big enough.,43988,2
43988,Also the suit is very short.,43988,2
43988,I couldn't even get it to tie around my neck.,43988,2
43988,Unless you are super petite I do not suggest purchasing this suit.,43988,2
43989,"Picture on website is not accurate..they are not as ""fitted"" in the waist as depicted
Also, overall they run small",43989,2
43990,"This skirt would have been great if it hadn't been so strangely made...in the picture, it must be on someone who's very tall (I'm 5'1 and couldn't get it above my knees unless I pulled it above my ribcage--in which case it makes you look fat in the middle if you wear something over it, so that's not happening!).",43990,2
43990,It was also much tighter than expected.,43990,2
43990,"The waist was absolutely fine, but the skirt itself was like a pencil skirt except for the translucent material at the bottom.",43990,2
43990,"It wasn't very flattering at all--I usually wear a 6 (which is a small) and I ordered a medium to be safe, and it was much too snug.",43990,2
43990,"I would've kept it if it had the right shape and wasn't too tight in the thighs, but, oh well...disappointing!",43990,2
43991,Beautiful color although it was more pink than coral.,43991,2
43991,Also the length was nowhere near as long as it looks in the picture.,43991,2
43991,I bought it in hopes that it'd be an extra long cardigan but it was just a regular fit sweater.,43991,2
43991,The picture is very deceiving.,43991,2
43992,"Larger than my old wallet, need to remove my drivers license to show my identity each time, old wallet had a window, no need to remove license.",43992,2
43992,Holds no more then my old one.,43992,2
43993,"The product itself wasn't very good, as the decal was a sticker that didn't stick very well, however the customer service was great.",43993,2
43994,"It's a super cute ring, however does have its flaws.",43994,2
43994,"It looks absolutely adorable, however every time I wear it it leaves a very dark green mark around my finger.",43994,2
43994,"I have tried putting clear nail polish on it, but nothing seems to make it stop.",43994,2
43994,"It's a very cute ring, just disappointed in the quality",43994,2
43995,Strap fell apart shortly after I started using it.,43995,2
43995,You get what you pay for..,43995,2
43996,The arms are akward.,43996,2
43996,The arm wholes are too snug and cut too short.,43996,2
43996,I though the dress would cover my shoulder width but it didn't.,43996,2
43996,I'm a 5'1 122 pear shaped and ordered a small.,43996,2
43996,It fits almost loosely every where but my arm/shoulder area.,43996,2
43997,"It's so beautiful but I received it damaged, one of the big stones was broken.",43997,2
43998,too small.,43998,2
43998,did not like the material - seemd cheap.,43998,2
43999,they broke on the first wear!,43999,2
