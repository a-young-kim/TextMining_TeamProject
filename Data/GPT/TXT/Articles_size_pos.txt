length us good so I'm going to get it altered to fit better, great price can't pass it up.That is simply not true, unless a size wants a skin-tight shirt.While this looks great on my '" daughter, it is too short unless she is standing still.Another few inches and it would be perfect.It is made for someone with very large hips.I wish I'd gone with the medium because it's much too roomy around my " waist.Great fitI ordered the Medium size based on the measurement chart, and while the dress did fit well, the skirt material was just not soft enough to lay nicely.And it's a little lopsided.I first

was just so tightI fold them over til they fit better.Once you resign yourself to that fact it fits and looks greatA little wide for my daughter.On one of the shoes it's perfect but on the other side the strap is too big/looseIt's cute, but I think it has what's known as a modern fit."It is broad in the shoulders and the armhole is roomy enough, but the body seems closer cut than I expected or hoped it would be.Who knows..Anyway, still a great buy for the priceI got a medium because a lot of the reviews said true to size but I guess I have too much junk in my trunk.Cute if they ended up fitting well.A large almost seems like it would be too big, but I was ntacted by the vendor to see if I uld fit a different size or if there was anything they uld do to make my purchase better.it was bigger then I wontedPlease know, the undershirts run small.Otherwise it fit.Big ringThis is quite short and I would definitely wear something under it.Style doesn't fit like picture.It fits nicely as

everywhere else.I am nsidering ordering a larger size, but wasn't mpletely impressed with the overall feel.Not very mfortable, but it does seem able to fit a large range of body types.Only downside

was a pretty good fit but it uld have been a little longer.The shirt fits well, with the exception of the arms around the shoulders.I would not remmend it if you have wider shoulders or larger arms.It fits around my abdomen but the straps aren't very stretchy and they dig into my shoulders.Super cute, but does not fit my newborn.To be resizable there must be enough band to go smaller or larger enabling wear on different fingers).Also, the waist line would be more flattering if a tad higher instead of being in the middle of the dress.The item fit but the strap was not sent in the package.I have a relatively slender neck, so beware.Cup is heavier than expected and is not dishwasher safe.Wearer wears large, bought large, fits snug.Granted my daughter is in the th percentile in height, I went with a larger size thinking she uld grow into it.Upon arrival and trying it on, the torso fit her well but the arms were too long easily remedied by rolling the cuffs up once and the legs were

stay in place.This fits more loose around the chest and shoulders than I was expecting.I'm '  and mediums generally fit the way I prefer.I bought XL -) and it fit well for the most part, just not a lot of support in the cup.The cup size fit me well I'm a D) and wrapped around my body well, just not happy with padded cup shape.. doesn't give lift like picture shows.Loved the length, but

made however I wear a L. an XXL would have fit perfectly but it is a pretty nice casual shirtThis is more suited for teenagers and/ or women without butt.just have to lose weight to fit into it better.Fit well from sleeves but was long for me bodywiseThe deisgn was beautiful, but I ordered it too large.It's very cute and it is very easy to change the size of it if you want to wear it on different fingers.I have long fingers and the XL was still too short.Cute but too tight.So when I order and XL /) I expect it to fit that way.Pretty shoes, the foot fit great, but the calves were not

strength to me.they have since stopped fraying, but i can only imagine that the the fraying will increase in the futureFits nice and feels good.Exactly what I was looking for in size and weight.So, uld be a perfect length for someone a little shorter.The sizes on these dresses from seller to seller are over the chartI would definitely remmend this if you don't have a long torso.Well, too

medium, which is fairly small, and I only wear small underwear.I have amazon prime and the only size for free day shipping is a large???Ordered a Medium it was better but not snug like I wanted it...The dress part only mes to the middle of my thigh as opposed to a below-the-knee fit I thought it would be.(for reference I'm '" and ordered a medium).Not as thick as advertised will need a size smaller..other than that its a nice ring...I loved the top and it actually fit my DDD boobs but the wire poked out the first time I wore it and I just don't know if the price is worth the one time

reviews, I decided to purchase China Large/US Medium.The product looks great, but clearly I don't understand UK sizing.Fits as expected, a lil looser in the chest and arm pit/ short sleeve area than I personally prefer, but that sort of thing is based on body type and just being a lil nitpicky.The chains where a bit longer ad thicker then I expected, but till what I wanted overallIt's adjustable,
